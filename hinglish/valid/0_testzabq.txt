 shamsher singh kaa apana al-shipha naam kaa ek dweep hota he, jisamen wo hathiyaaron or nashile padaarthon kaa vyapaar karata he
 Sikander Singh is Shamsher's adopted son, and with him Sanjana and Suraj are his twin children
 yash shamsher ke samrajya kaa ek bahut kareebi or sikandar kaa vishwaasapaatr rahata he
 Past events show that Ran Vijay is the enemy of Shamsher, who continues to cause trouble in Shamsher's business
 jab sanjana or suraj 25 saal ke ho jate hai, to unka vakil unki maan kii vasiyat sunaata he, jiske anusaar wo donon unki jaaydaad ke 25-25% ke hissedaar honge or vahiin sikandar ko 50% hissedari milegi
 Seeing this kind of partiality, those people start hating Alexander
 shamsher donon ko bataata he ki sikandar unke bade bhai ranchhod singh kaa betaa he
 The story then moves back to the old time, Handia village in the 1970s
 jisamen singh parivaar ke itihaas ko bataaya jaataa he
 Both Singh brothers used to give trade to the Indian Army
 vahiin handiya kaa rahane vaala ek netaa unase gaiyr-kanoonee rup se hathiyaar maangata he, jise ranchhod manaa kar detaa he
 Due to this refusal, they become hostile to that leader

 The Singh family is then accused of distributing weapons to enemies
 iske baad shamsher apane bade bhai ke bete, sikandar ko beijing main padhai ke liye bhej detaa he, or vahiin suraj, sanjana or uski vidhwaa maan ko cambodia le jaataa he
 The story reverts to al-shifa in the present day
 jisamen ek raat yash uski premi ke bare main sikandar ko bataata he, sikandar kahata he ki beijing main use ek ladki, jesica se pyaar ho gaya tha, par wo use chhod kar chale gai
 Shamsher's childhood friend Brijmohan says that his friend is being used by hotel leaders, who are using him for their erotic acts
 ye sab ek jasusi camere main record ho chukaa he or hard drive main maujuud he
 That hard disk is kept in Cambodia's bank locker
 shamsher is kaam ko karne ke liye sikandar ko bhejtaa he
 The next day at the party, it is revealed that Jessica is Yash's girlfriend
 sikandar or jesica akele main suraksha kamare main milte hai, uske agle din hi suraj or sanjana un donon ke milane ko record kiye the, us video ko yash ko dikhaate hai
 Yash angrily comes to Jessica's house, and Alexander is also found there
 sikandar use baad main bataata he ki ye sanjana or suraj kii chaal thi, jisase ve sikandar ko barbaad kar saken
 Yash also gets along with Alexander, but Sanjana and Suraj do not know this
 phir ve sabhi mil kar us hard discs ko lene ke liye nikal padate hai
 When Alexander gives the hard disk to Shamsher, Shamsher blows it up by placing a bomb in his car and goes to meet the leaders whose videos are on that disc
 un netaaon or uske do judwa bacchon ke saamne shamsher bataata he ki sikandar kii bam dhamaake main maut ho gai he
 After that, he senses as soon as he connects the hard disk
 hard discs main un netaaon ke video na ho kar, sikandar ke maan kaa video hota he, jo usne khud hi banaaya tha
 In which she says that Ranchod Singh was murdered by Shamsher and that both the twins are also from Ranchod Singh
 iske baad sikandar aata he or bataata he ki kis tarah usne raghu chachaa kii madad se bam dhamaake se apni jaan bachaai
 It is later revealed that he knew this truth ten years ago
 baad main shamsher bataata he ki yash uskaa betaa he
 Alexander and Yash fight in the desert, and Alexander kills all of Shamsher's soldiers and forces Yash and Shamsher to surrender to Interpol officer Jessica

 In finance, the capital asset pricing model is used to determine the desired return rate theoretically appropriate for a capital asset when this asset is to be added to an already well-managed portfolio, and while that asset is Bad risks are known
 is model main parisampatti ke ashaakhneey jokhim jise vitt kshetra main praayah 'beta' ke dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he, ko gananaa main liya jaataa he tathaa bazaar ke pratyaashit pratilabh va saidhantik jokhim-mukt parisampatti ke pratyaashit pratilabh ko bhi

 empirical testing main yah sanskaran adhik drudh tha tathaa siepiem kii vaishvik sweekruti main iskaa prabhavi yogadan rahaa
 Despite the advent of many modern methods of pricing and portfolio selection and arbitrage empirical flaws, CAPM is still more prevalent due to its generality and usefulness in a wide variety of circumstances
 siepiem kisi akeli parisampatti athwa parisampattiyon ke samooh kii keemat nirdhaaran karne ke liye ek model he
 For a single security, we use the securities market line and its relationship with expected return and systemic risk to determine how much the price of a single market will be determined by the market compared to its risk category
 pratibhuti bazaar rekha se kisi ek sampatti kii puure bazaar kii tulana main pratifal-jokhim anupaat kii gananaa bhi kii ja sakati he
 Hence, as the expected return of an asset will decrease by its beta coefficient, the return-risk ratio of this single asset will be equal to the return-risk ratio of the entire market
 is prakaar: The market-to-risk ratio is effectively the market risk premium / premium and by re-employing the above equation and assuming E, we get the capital asset pricing model
 jahaan: If this is rewritten from the risk premium point of view, we find that: arthath kisi parisampatti kaa "apana jokhim premium"- "bazaar jokhim premium" va "beta" kaa gunanfal he
 Note 1: The expected market returns are often estimated by taking a geometric average of the value of historical returns in a market-portfolio
 note 2: jokhim kii gananaa hetu prayukt 'jokhim mukt pratifal dar' praayah etihasik daron kaa arithmetic ausat hota he naa ki vartmaan dar
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 siepiem ko amaap adhivetan or vishisht jokhim shaamil karne ke liye sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 This is important for investors who do not have an advanced-diversified portfolio
 sameekaran parmparik siepiem sameekaran ke samaan hi he “jisamen bazaar jokhim adhivetan ko beta utpaa or bazaar jokhim adhivetan ke guna se pratisthapit kar diya gaya he:”:5 "where: pratibhuti bazaar rekha siepiem ke formula kaa graph ke rup main chithran karti he
 show the risk on the x axis and the expected return on the y axis
 bazaar jokhim kaa anumaan pratibhuti bazaar rekha kii dhalaan se lagaaya jaataa he
 The relationship between β and expected return is depicted on the securities market line, which represents the expected return as a function of β
 The intercept is the bazaar main uplabdh nominal jokhim mukt dar he, jabaki dhalaan market premium he, E− Rf
 It can be said that the securities market line represents as a single-factor model of the asset price, while β shows how likely it is to be affected by market changes, thus the SML equation is : aisi paristhitiyon ke liye yah ek ati mahatvapurn tul he jab pataa karnaa ho ki kya koi parisampatti / pratibhuti jokhim kii tulana main ek sweekaarya pratifal degi ki nahin
 Solitary assets are depicted on the securities market line graph
 yadi jokhim va pratifal kaa paraspar chithran rekha se upar hota he to iskaa arth he ki yah pratibhuti sasti mil rahi he or is par adhik laabh kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 If it falls below the illustration line, then the price should be considered expensive and it will not get as much profit as the risk is being taken
 siepim kaa upyog karte hue pratyaashit / vaanchhit labhdar e { \ displaystyle E} gyaat hone ke pashchaat isaki tulana sampatti ke anumaanit pratilabh dar se karke yah pataa laga sakate hai ki yah nivesh acha rahegaa ki nahin
 For this we will need to calculate an independent estimate of the return on assets, which is usually done by fundamental or technical analysis, proportional analysis, etc
 siepiem ke anusaar, yadi anumaanit mulya, sampatti ke siepiem dwaara sujhai dar ke saath samyojit kiye gaye bhavishya nakadapravaah ke baraabar he - to sampatti sahi mulya par mil rahi he
 If the estimated value is higher than the CAPM valuation, the property is cheaper
 kisi parisampatti kaa pratibhuti bazaar rekha par sthit nahin hona uske mulya main visangati ko darshata he
 Since the expected return of the property at timepoint t { \ displaystyle t} is e = e - p t p t { \ displaystyle e = { \ frac {E-P_ {t}} {P_ {t xxrep 5 } as suggested by the CAPM If the return exceeds, it means that p t { \ displaystyle P_ {t}} is too low, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t + 1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 siepiem kaa prayog karne par parisampatti kaa mulya p 0 { \ displaystyle P_{0}}, nimna leniyar sambandh se pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he: Where PT { \ displaystyle P_ {T}} is the payoff of the asset or portfolio
 siepiem dwaara pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi vishisht sampatti ke tulanaatmak jokhim ko dhyaan main rakhte hue uski apekshit vaapasi arthath samaayojan dar, kitni honi chahie
 If the value of beta is more than one, it means - above average risk; Less than one means - below average risk
 is prakaar, kisi zyada jokhim vaale stock kaa beta adhik hoga or unhen adhik dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 Whereas less sensitive stocks will have lower beta and will be adjusted at a lower rate
 yah prachlit anaupchaarik dharna, ki adhik jokhim lene vaale niveshak adhik pratifal kii ichha rakhte hai, ke anuroop hi he
 Because beta is the measure of the vulnerability of a single asset to full market risk, it is clear from the definition that beta will be a measure of market risk: 1
 bazaar jokhim maapne ke liye ek poorak paimaane ke rup main stock market index kaa prayog bahutayat main kiya jaataa he, atah inkaa beta maap 1 hota he
 Thus, investors of a large and well-defined portfolio can expect results from their investments according to market movements
 kisi bhi portpholio main maujuud jokhim pramukhtah do prakaar ke jokhimon kaa yoga hota he - vyavasthaatmak jokhim, jise bazaar jokhim yaa ashaakhneey jokhim bhi kaha jaataa he, tathaa avyavashthaatmak jokhim jise shaakhneey jokhim kaha jaataa he
 Systematic or market risk is due to the factors that affect all investment options, ie the entire market
 is prakaar ke jokhim par niyantran karnaa kathin he
 Disorganized risk is the risk that affects a particular security or investment option
 nivesh kaa vishaakhan karke aise jokhim ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context — ie its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness — as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance ie less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 siepiem maanata he ki kisi nivesh ke jokhim-pratifal anupaat ko durust kiya ja saktaa he, ek adarsh portpholio vah hoga jo ki ek nirdhaarit pratifal dar ke liye nunatam jokhim ke saath ho
 Additionally, as each new asset added to the portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above
 All such optimal portfolios, ie, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 An investor can also invest some part of his fund in risky assets and save some cash, which can be earned at a risk-free rate
 
 Here the ratio of risky and risk free does not determine the overall return - this relationship is definitely linear
 is prakaar se yah sambhav he ki nimna don main se kisi ek prakaar ek nishchit return praapt kiya ja saktaa he : However for a fixed return, only one of the above options would prove to be efficient
 chunki jokhimamukt sampatti paribhaashatah kisi bhi anya sampatti se correlated nahin he, dwitiya vikalp main saamanytah kam vichlan hoga jiske kaaran yah donon main se adhik kushal hoga
 This relationship would also hold true for other portfolios on the effective range: some cash with a higher return - is more efficient - rather than just a portfolio with lower returns at the same return rate
 ek nishchit jokhimamukt dar ke liye, ek hi kushal portpholio hoga jise ki nakadi ke saath milakar kisi bhi pratilabh ke liye nunatam jokhim kii sthiti praapt kii ja sakati he
 This is the market portfolio
 sabhi niveshkon: The bi-beta model distinguishes the upward beta from the overlying beta
 siepiem tathaa dwi-beta model main antar yah he ki siepiem model kii manyata he ki urdhvagami or adhigami beta ek hi hai jabaki dwi-beta model esa nahin maanata
 AC validation is rarely correct, so a bi-beta model is considered more appropriate

 1830 Letters derived from the demotic: Banabhatta was a seventh-century Sanskrit prose writer and poet
 vah raja harshavardhan ke aasthaan kavi the
 His two major texts are: Harshacharitam and Kadambari
 harshcharitam, raja harshavardhan kaa jivan-charitra tha or kadambari duniya kaa pehla upanyaas tha
 Even before the completion of Kadambari, when Banabhatta ji died, his son Bhushanbhatt took up the task of completing the novel
 donon granth sanskrit sahitya ke mahatvapurn granth maane jate he
 Place of Birth - Chandreh M
 Q
 mahakavi banbhatta ne gadhyrachana ke kshetra main vahi sthaan praapt kiya he jo ki kalidas ne sanskrit kavy kshetra main
 The Western writers have in one voice recorded the commendations on the arrow
 aaryasptati ke lekhak govardhanacharya kaa kathan he- The praise of Dhanapala, the author of Tilakamanjari is as follows - trilochan ne nimnlikhit padya main baan kii prashansa kii he- According to Kaviraj, author of Raghavapandaviya- pashchaadvarti lekhakon kii anant prashastiyon main ye kuch hi hai
 Baan is one of the few Sanskrit writers whose life and times are definitely known
 kadambari kii bhoomika main tathaa harshcharitam ke pratham do uchhvaason main baan ne apane vansh ke sambandh main vistaarpurvak soochna di he
 In the village named Pritikoot on the banks of the Son River, the arrow was born in the Vatsyayagotri Vidyabrahman clan
 baan apane vansh kaa udbhav saraswati tathaa dadhichi ke putr saraswat ke bhai vatsa se batalaate hai
 The descendant of Vatsa was Kubera whose fourth son Pashupat was the great-grandfather of Baan
 baan ke pitamah kaa naam arthpati tha jinako gyaarah putr hue
 Baan's father's name was Chitrabhanu
 baan ke shaishavkaal main hi unki mata rajyadevi kii mrityu ho gai
 He was raised by his father
 baan abhi chaudaa varsh ke hi the ki unke pita unke liye kapaphi sampatti chhodkar chal based
 Due to the onset of youth and wealth, the arrow left the house to see the world itself
 unhone vibhinn prakaar ke logon se sambandh sthapit kiya
 Among his comrades and friends, Baan called Ishaan, a poet of Prakrit, two sons, a son of a physician, a reader, a goldsmith, a ratnakar, a writer, a bookkeeper, a chord, two singers, a prathari, two announcers, one anthem
 The teacher is a teacher, a dancer, a teacher, a nut, a dancer, a tantric, a master of metaphysics and an andrajaalik etc
 kai deshon kaa bhraman karke vah apane sthaan preetikut lautaa
 While living there, he received a message from Harshavardhan's cousin Krishna that some chewed men had blasphemed the king, so he immediately went to meet the king and after a two-day visit met the king on the banks of Ajiravati
 pratham saakshaatkaramen baan ko bahut niraashaa hui kyonki samraat ke saathi malwadhish ne kaha ‘ayamsaubhujangah’ he) astu, baan ne apni sthiti kaa spashtikaran kiya or samrat usase prasann hue samraat ke saath kuch maas rahakar baan vaapis lautaa or unhone prastut harshcharit ke rup main harsh kii jeevani likhni prarambh kii
 The autobiography of the arrow ends here and we do not know anything about the last time of the arrow
 parantu aisa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki baan ko rajsangrakshan mila or unhone bhi harsh charit likhakar uskaa mulya chukaa diya
 Baan had a son named Bhushanbhatta or Bhattapulind, who completed Kadambari after Baan's death
 at: kadambari ko do lekhakon ne purna kiya
 There is no difficulty in deciding the timing of the arrow
 harshcharit ke prarambh main ve harsh ko rajya karata hua raja batalaate hai- The description of Harsha's dynasty, for example the names of Prabhakarvardhan and Rajyavardhana, proves that the Banas were the kings of Harshavardhana, the emperor of Kannauj
 baan kaa yah kaal bahya saakshyon se bhi samya rakhata he
 The arrow was mentioned by Anandavardhana, a scholar of the Alankara scripture in the 9th century
 sambhavtah baan anandavardhan se bahut pehle ho chuke the
 Vamana also mentions the arrow
 goudvaho ke lekhak vaakpati raaj bhi baan kii prashansa karte hai
 Apart from Kadambari and Harsharitam, many other compositions are also considered as arrows
 unamem se markendeya puraana ke devi mahatmaya par aadhaarit durga kaa stotra chandistak he
 Often a play 'parvati Parinay' is also considered to have been composed by Baan
 parantu vastutah iskaa lekhak koi pashchaadvarti vaaman bhattabaan he
 According to a scholarly critic, the adjective has the characteristic of the adjective in very syntactic, syllabic meanings and in the use of unused meanings of words
 unke gadhy main laalitya he or lambe samaason main bal pradaan karne kii shakti he
 They use plurality, metaphor, metaphor, provocation, syllogism, parody and especially a multiplicity of contradictions
 jaisaa ki achchhodasarovar ke ullekh se spasht he unka prakruti varnan tathaa anya prakaar ke varnan karne par adhikaar he
 In Kadambari, the teachings of Shuknas and Harshacharitam's Prabhakarvardhan's in-depth study of human nature is evident
 baan kii shabdaawalee vistrut he or praayah vah ek shabd ke sabhi paryaayon kaa prayog karte hai
 He has used 19 words for 'sound'
 isi prakaar visheshnon ke prayog main baan nishnaat hai or aisa prathit hota he ki visheshnon kaa ant nahin hoga
 His descriptions like Ujjayini and Diwakar Mitra's ashram are flawless, diverse and impressive even when detailed
 banbhatta kaa maanav prakruti kaa gyaan ascharyajanak he
 None of his elements remained unanswered
 yah thik hi kahagaya he- Baan did not leave out any utterances, due to which no later writer could encroach Baan
 kavi kii sarvatomukhi pratibha, vyapak gyaan, adbhut varnan style or prayek varnya-vishay ke sookshmatisookshm varnan ke aadhaar par yah subhashit prachlit he ki baan ne kisi varnan ko achoota nahin choda he or unhone jo kuch kah diya, usase aage kehane ko bahut kuch shesh nahin rah jaataa
 Baan has analyzed the inner nature and emotions as deeply as the external nature has been described with beauty, warmth and subtlety
 unke varnan itane vyapak or sateek hote hai, ki pathak ko yah anubhav hota he ki un paristhitiyon main vah bhi aisa hi sochataa yaa karata
 In the morning Kaal, Sandhyavarnan, Shudrakavarna, Shukavarnan, Chandalakanya narration etc
, the arrow has not only described, but has made a living picture of every object
 chandrapid ko diye gayi shukanasopadesh main to kavi kii pratibha kaa charmotkarsh parilakshith hota he
 The writing of the poet seems to be flowing in the spirit
 shukanasopadesh main aisa prathit hota he maano saraswati saakshaat murtimati hokar bol rahi hai
 In the description of the arrow, the harmony of language and language, the use of a sense of language, the concomitant use of ornaments, the short verse after the accusation and descent in the language, and the long concatenated phrase, etc
 prayek varnan main pehle vishay kaa sangopang varnan miltaa he, bahut samastapad milte hai, tatpashchaat shleshamulak upamaayen or utprekshaayen, tadnantar virodhabhas yaa parisankhya se samaapti
 The use of sycophantic analogy, contradiction and paroxysm has more of cripplingness, obscurity, and intellectual exertion
 kahin-kahin varnan itane lambe ho gayi hai ki foundne par bhi kriyaapad milane kathin ho jate hai
 In Mahasweta Darshan, one sentence is 67 lines and in Kadambari Darshan, one sentence is 72 lines

 This property of theirs is called the non-linear transmission of light
 jis padaarth se hokar prakaash kii kirane guzarati hai, use 'madhyam' kehete hai
 When rays of light travel through some medium and reach another medium, there are three actions: prakaash kii kirnon kaa kuch, yaa adhik, bhaag donon madhyamon ke vibhaajak tal se pehle hi madhyam main waapas lautaa diya jaataa he
 This action is called reflection
 prakaash kii kirnon kaa kuch bhaag vibhaajak tal par avashoshit ho jaataa he
 And prakaash kii kirnon kaa shesh bhaag duusare madhyam main chalaa jaataa he
 This action is called refraction

 Rays of light follow certain rules during reflection and refraction processes
 paravartan sambandhi niyam nimnlikhit he : 1
 The incident ray, the normal and reflected rays placed at the incident point in the dividing plane, all three are located in the same plane
 apati evam paravartit kirane abhilamb ke paraspar vipareet ore sthit hoti hai or The angle of incidence and reflection are equal
 <i=<r Following are the rules of refraction: 1
 apati kiran, vibhaajak tal main aapatan bindu par daalaa gaya abhilamb evam apavartit kiran, teenon ek hi tal main sthit hote hai
 2
 Emergent and refracted rays lie opposite sides of the normal
 or Sections of incidence and incidence of refraction have a constant ratio
 is anupaat ko greek akshar mu dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he or ise pehle madhyam ke saapeksh duusare madhyam kaa apvartanaank kaha jaataa he
 == Refraction from Prism == bharatkosh praangan bharatkosh sampadakeey calendar prashnottaree purna aantarik paravartan purna aantarik paravartan purna aantarik paravartan ek prakaashiya parighatna he
 Light can always pass through a medium optically in a dense medium, but it cannot always pass through a rare medium
 jab prakaash kirane saghan madhyam se viral madhyam ke prishth par aaptit ho rahi hon or aapatan kone kranthik kone se adhik ho, tab prakaash kaa apvartan nahin hota, balki sampurna prakaash paravartit hokar usee madhyam main laut jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called 'full internal reflection'
 purna aantarik paravartan kaa ek upyogi prayog optical fibre main kiya jaataa he
 The work of optical fibers is based on the principle of complete internal reflection
 saamanyat: vyavahrut honevaale prakaashiya yantron ke apvartak tal aise parikraman tal hote hai, jinka samamiti aksh sarvanishtha hota he
 From this symmetry it becomes clear that the image of each point on the axis is formed at another point on the axis itself
 duusare shabdon main kaha ja saktaa he ki sampurna aksh swayan apana hi bimb hota he
 a refractive system has a point on its axis from which rays of light emit parallel to the axis outside the refractive system and thus the image of that point is formed at infinity
 us bindu ko apvartak tantra kaa pratham focus bindu kehete hai
 The plane considered to be right angled along the axis through the first focus point is called the first focus plane
 is tal ke kisi bindu se chalanevaali kirane apvartan ke uparaant paraspar samaantar ho jaati he
 The second focus point is the point on the axis of the refractive system at which all the rays parallel to the axis from infinity converge, that is, the point at which the object of the object at infinity is formed
 is bindu se aksh ke samakonik kalpit samtal ko dwitiya focus tal kehete hai
 The cone of rays that diverge from the first focus point of a lens deviates on both surfaces of the lens
 apati kirano ko aage kii ore tathaa nirgat kirnon ko peeche kii ore badhaane par, jo pariched bindu milte hai, ve sarvanishtha tal par sthit hote hai, jise lens kaa pratham mukhya samtal kehete hai
 Twice the deviation on the two plane of the lens is equal to the same deviation of the beam on the main plane
 isi prakaar lens ke aksh ke samaantar aanevaali kirane apvartan ke uparaant dwitiya focus bindu kii ore agrasar hoti hai
 If the incident rays are extended forward and the refracted rays backward, their point of passage will be located on a plane, which is called the second principal plane
 in samatalon ke aksh ke saath pariched bindu ko kramash: pratham tathaa dwitiya mukhya bindu kehete hai
 The first focus distance and the distance of the second focus point from the second focus point are called the second focus distance
 prakaashiya yantron ke nirmaan main kai baton kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he, visheshkar yah ki kisi binduvat vastu se aanevaali sabhi kirane ek binduvat bimb par hi ekatra hon, arthath ve vipathan ke dosha se mukt hon
 For this it is necessary that the images should not have spherical and variational aberrations, otherwise the images will be deformed and instead of being made in one place many images of different colors will be formed
 in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye ek abhilakshan falan foondnaa padataa he
 After analyzing the images made by all the rays reaching the refractory plane from an object, we come to know that the object is prone to defects and deformation

 Being compelled, Durgadas sent his family to Udaipur and lived alone in Jodhpur and waited for the consequences of injustice

 Taking the opportunity one day was going to the court to take leave from Maharaj

 Brother Durgadas started saying! Would have been nice if you didn't go to the court today; Because you are not skilled in going to the court today
 mujhe jahaan tak pataa chalaa he vah yah ki maharaj ne apane swaarthee mitron kii salaah se aapke maar daalane kii gupt rup se ajna di he
 Durgadas said - 'brother! Now i am old, i have to die, then why should i fear death by being a Kshatriya? Stigma in Rajputi; Afraid of death, go back! Saying thus, Nirbhay reached the court like Singh and with folded hands asked the Maharaja for a pilgrimage
 maharaj ne upree man se kaha – ‘ chachaaji! aapkaa viyog hamaare liye bada dukhad hoga; parantu ab aap vruddh hue hai, or prashn tirthayatr kaa he; isliye nahin bhi nahin kii jaati
 Well, go back as soon as possible
 durgadas ne kaha – ‘ maharaj kii jaisi ajna or chal diya; parantu dwaar tak jaakar lautaa
 Maharaj asked uncle, why? Durgadas said - 'maharaj, i will not go today; i just remembered that Maharaj Yashwant Singh had given me the key to a secret treasure, but till now i could neither tell you the secret treasure nor could i give the key; Therefore, i should also hand it to you, then go? Because now i am very old, i do not know when and where i die
 Then this unlimited amount of paddy will be found in all the soil
 yah sunakar ajitsingh ko lobh ne dabaa liya
 Who in the world is not surrounded by greed? Who has violated the command of the greed god? Started thinking; If according to my knowledge Durgadas was killed somewhere, then this property will not come into his hands
 kya or avasar na milegaa? phir dekha jaayga
 Thinking this, he indicated to his friends

 a major feature of the Saptakand Ramayana is that it does not depict Rama, Sita and others as heroes
 do maapnon kii tulana ko anshshodhan kehete hai
 The first of these measurements is measured by a measuring instrument of known purity or of known magnitude and the second measurement is made with a measuring instrument that has to be calibrated
 gyaat parishuddhta vaala maapakyantr maanak kehalaata he
 If the inner diameter of the thermometer tube is not universally the same, then marking the distance at an equal distance will cause errors
 faltah taap kii sachhee naap ke liye yah jaananaa aavashyak hota he ki prayek chihn par kitni truti he
 Similarly, for each measuring instrument it is necessary to know how much error is there on each sign
 isi ko anshshodhan kehete hai
 No matter how carefully the instruments are made, there is definitely some error found somewhere on microscopic examination
 phir, samay bachaane ke liye yantra nirmaataa bahudhaa purna shuddhta laane kii cheshtaa bhi nahin karte
 Therefore calibration is important in microscopic measurements
 antarrashtriya vigyaan sangh ne moulik tathaa udbhoot raashiyon kii paribhaashaayen de rakhi hai or unki ikaiyaan bhi nishchit kar di hai
 Authentic instruments have been made to measure them
 yadi koi naveen maapak yantra banaaya jaataa he to uskaa anshshodhan unheen pramanik yantron ke anshon kii tulana se kiya jaataa he
 Example: Centigrade thermometer's endpoint is assumed to be the freezing point of pure water and the vertical point boiling point
 himank or kvathanank jal kii ashuddhiyon or newnaadhik vayudab ke kaaran badal jate hai
 Therefore, the following physical conditions have also been determined: Water should be pure and air pressure is 76 cm
 m Must be equal to Pardastambha
 nayaa tapamapak banaate samay nalee kii ghundi main paara bharkar in do binduon kaa sthaan nalee main pehle ankit kiya jaataa he
 Then the space between them is divided into 100 equal parts

 However, the section of the tube is not ideally the same everywhere and there may be errors in calibration
 inhen kaarnon se anshshodhan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 For this the lessons of the new thermometer are compared to an authentic thermometer which is kept in the same condition with the same
 prasthachhed kii samanta kii jaanch nalee main paare kaa lagbhag ek inch lanbaa stambh rakhkar or use vividh sthanon main khiskaakar kii ja sakati he
 If the passage is universally the same then the length of the column of mercury will be the same everywhere
 isi prakaar do sthir dur sookshmdarshiyon ke bich padane vaale anshachihnon ko kai sthanon main dekhakar sthir kiya ja saktaa he ki nalee par sab chihn baraabar duriyon par lage hai yaa nahin
 Now if the arithmetic is the same and the marks are at equal distances, then we have to do the second refinement for the midpoint and the vertices
 inkaa nishaan apramanik paristhitiyon main lagaaya gaya he
 There may be inaccuracy in water and air pressure is also exactly 76 cm

 in kaarnon se jal kaa himank or kvathanank badal jaataa he
 Therefore, in the situations presented, the thermometer's endpoint and vertices are read and compared to the authentic thermometer's text, both points are modified

 It was only in 1863 that he earned a Masters degree
 kuch samay tak sindh ke hyderabad or ratnagiri ke rajkeey vidyalayon main headmaster ke taur par kaary karne ke baad ve elfinston college main vyaakhyaata pad par niyukt hue or aage chal kar pune ke deccan college main sanskrit ke pratham bhartiya profesar hue
 Prior to his retirement in 1894, Bhandarkar was the vice-chancellor of Mumbai University
 1885 main germany kii gotinge university ne unhen doctoret kii oopaadhi pradaan kii
 He also went to London and Vienna to attend the International Conference of Orientalists
 shikshashasthri ke taur par bhandarkar 1903 main bhartiya parishad ke anadhikarik sadsy chune gayi
 Gopal Krishna Gokhale was also a member of that council
 1911 main ramakrishna gopal bhandarkar ko nite kii oopaadhi se sammanit kiya gaya
 Despite the socially conservative atmosphere, Bhandarkar administered university education to his daughters and granddaughters and did not marry them until he attained maturity to choose a life partner of his choice
 unhone apni vidhwaa putree ke punarvivaah ke liye bhi anumati di
 He died on 24 August 1925
 aaj se lagbhag sau varsh purv puraatatv vishyon main bharatiyon ko archeshan nahin tha
 Those teaching Prakrit languages like Pali, Magadhi etc
 were rare and there was no authorship in these languages

 Thus, interest of Indians towards authentic knowledge of history increased
 kramash: sarkaar kii drushti bharat ke hastlikhit granthon kii khoj or prakaashan kii disha main jane lagi
 Therefore, this task was entrusted to Dr
 Bhandarkar and he completed his work in five huge texts
 puraatatv ke itihaaskaaron ke liye ye granth maardarshak hai
 In 1883, he was invited to the Conference of Oriental Language Scholars in Vienna and the government and foreigners were shocked by the seriousness and investigative style of their studies there

 In your memoirs, the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute has been established in Poona
 apni vidhwaa kanya kaa punarvivaah kar inhone apane saahas kaa parichay diya
 There was no sense of egoism even after receiving immense respect and respect
 swadhyay or sanyam inke jivan kaa moolmantra tha
 In 1872, James Varghese started a research journal called Indian Endtiquery to share the research findings of orientalist scholars on one platform
 isi ke saath bhandarkar kii bauddhikta bhi paravaan chadhi
 Bhandarkar was one of those who were considered reliable to handle the responsibility of this research journal
 unhone apni bhoomika nibhaane main koi kotahi bhi nahin barti
 Apart from Indian andquetry, the research journals and organizations that caught his attention were the Mumbai branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, founded in 1804 by James Mackintosh
 bhandarkar ke saath ke
 T
 Telang was among the third generation members of this society
 indian andtaqueri se shuru hui bauddhik yatra kii shuruyaat main bhandarkar 1872 se 1874 ke bich berlin ke profesar webar se uljhe
 He had a spirited logical and controversial debate with him on the issues of Patanjali's period and Patanjali's great language
 ‘patanjali kaa kaal’ lekh main bhandarkar ne webar ke nishkarshon ke ulat safaltaapurvak siddh kiya ki patanjali ke mahabhashya kii rachana isa purv duusari shatabdi ke madhya kii gayi thi
 Later Goldstucker also reached a similar decision for other reasons
 1873 main hi bhandarkar ne jarnal of mumbai branch of royal aciatic socity ke ek lekh dwaara karnal elice ke drushtikon main sudhaar kiya
 In another article, Bhandarkar disagreed with Goldstucker and Weber on the question of Patanjali and Katyayan's original residence
 webar kii is manyata ke vipareet ki patanjali patliputra se bhi purvi kshetra ke the, bhandarkar ne unhen pashchimi avadh ke kisi uttar- pashchimi sthaan kaa mul nivasee mana
 He proved Katyayan to be a native of the south
 indian andtaqueri ke 1874 ke ek lekh ‘patanjali mahabhashya main krishna ke sanket’ main bhandarkar mahabhashya ke kai uddharanon, shabdon kii nirmiti or unke mul ke bare main vistrut vyakhya ke zariye is prastaavna par pahunche ki jaise hindu kaal main samakaleen prachlit sthapanaayen / manyataayen naatakeey rup se puranic kaal kii hai, usee tarah krishna athwa vasudev dwaara kansa kaa vadh or bali kii adheenta sambandhi kahaniyaan patanjali ke kaal main lokapriy or charchit thim
 For this reason, the period of Mahabharata was much earlier like Patanjali's period, not the sixteenth century according to Colonel Ellis
 1974 main hi indian andtaqueri ke may ank main ‘vedaz in india’ sheershak ek lambe aalekh main spasht or sargarbhit dhang se bhandarkar ne bataaya ki kaise vaidic paath karne vaale brahman pariwaron dwaara vedon ke adhyayan se sanskrit shiksha kii paripati shuru kii gayi
 At the same time, the fame of being the best scholar of Indian culture invited Bhandarkar to attend the International Conference of Orientalists in London in 1874
 bhandarkar sammelan main nahin gayi par unhone satvaahan kaal ke raajaaon or unke udgam par prakaash daalane vaala lekh vahaan bheja
 This article was published in Transactions of Oriental Congress, 1874
 isane bhandarkar kii vidvatta kii saakh or badhaai
 He was made a member of the Royal Asiatic Society the following year, rating him as an internationally established scholar
 jab 1876 main wilson philologi lekcharship shrunkhlaa kii shuruyaat hui to uskaa pehla vyaakhyaan ramakrishna gopal bhandarkar ne hi diya
 Bhandarkar strengthened the establishment of philological science by the well-connected and educational use of Sanskrit and Pali
 1876 main unhone ek sanskrit naatak malti madhav kaa prakaashan karaayaa
 Later in 1886, he also attended the International Conference of Orientalists held in Vienna
 raajnneetik itihaas par bhandarkar ne do prabandh 'da arli history of da deccan' or 'a pip intu da arli history of india' likhe
 Bhandarkar considered 'the Early History of the Deccan' to be merely a compilation of facts
 is rachana main unhone pracheenatam kaal se musalamaanon kii vijay tak pashchimi bharat kaa aitihaasik vivaran prastut kiya he jisase raajnneetik itihaas ke saath aalochaykaal ke dauraan dakkan kii saamaajik, aarthik, dharmik, sahitya or kala kii sthiti par roshni padati he
 In the second book, Bhandarkar details the beginning of the Mauryan period to the closing phase of the Gupta empire when the Brahminical ideology under the Guptas resurfaced and whose expression is reflected in the Gupta period religion, art and literature
 1913 main bhandarkar ne apni sarvshereshth aitihaasik kriti 'vaishnavism, shaivizam and da miner relijas sects' likhi jo apni takneekee sanrachana ke baavjood aaj bhi guptakaleen dharmik aasthaaon main hone vaale parivartan ke adhyayan kaa mahatvapurn zariyaa he
 The tradition that Bhandarkar started as the 'encyclopaedia of indo-aryan Research' was later followed by G
, Bhullar and F
F
 Kilham pushed forward
 'di critical, koaparative and historical methd of inquayri' sheershak shodhpatr main bhandarkar ne dikhaaya he ki kaise anusandhan paddati main vibhinn sroton kii gahari chaanbin karke aitihaasik satya or sateek varnanaatmakataa kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 Determining the limits of this method, he discouraged the historian's tendency to cross-examine as a lawyer and emphasized the harsh impartiality of a judge
 unki drushti main vidwaan kaa lakshya shushk satya kaa sandhan hona chahie, saath hi use uplabdh saakshyon kii vishwasaneeyata nirdhaarit karne kaa harasambhav prayaas karnaa chahie
 Bhandarkar recommended to limit the discovery of a piece of historical truth in Janashruti to post-trial through research method, only as an opportunity
 ve maanate the ki itihaas kaa varnan usee rup main hona chahie jaisaa vah vastutah tha
 Aware of his social role, Bhandarkar proved that the study of ancient texts did not inspire modern reforms, instead modern reforms inspired the study of ancient texts
 badale main sudhaarkon ko in grathon se ek aisi jubaan mili jisase ve janata se baatcheet kar saken
 That is, the original inspiration for reform came out of the modern way of life and then the revival of ancient values by the reformers made it easy for those reforms to move forward
 vidhyaarthee jivan se hi bhandarkar saamaajik or dharmik sudhaarwadi kaaryakramon se sakriy rup se jud gayi the
 Secretly active against the orthodox caste system of the then society, Paramhans were active in the assembly since 1853
 1867 main keshavachandra sen ke mumbai aagaman ke pashchaat kolkata ke brahm samaaj ke tarz par mumbai main prarthana samaaj kii sthapana hui jisase bhandarkar 1869 main jud gayi
 While contradicting the pre-beliefs guided by Christian philosophy in this institution, he proved that the Indian society and philosophy have influenced European thought, while describing the prayer society as sophisticated Hinduism
 unhone chetaya ki hindu dharm or bhartiya sabhyataa ke prati kisi tarah kii avhelnaa vishadpurn parinaamon ko janm degi
 Addressing a conference of the Dalit class in 1912, advocating women education and widow marriage, with quotes extracted from their Sanskrit and Pali texts, rebuffed child marriage and called for Hindus to eradicate untouchability
 udaahranon ke madhyam se unhone samajhaayaa ki ise utpeedit virgon par meharbaani kii tarah nahin balki samaaj ko tikaaye rakhane kii aavashyaktaa ke taur par sweekaar karnaa hoga
 Bhandarkar's admirers and intellectual followers, with the support of Sir Ratan Tata and Sir Dorabji Tata, established the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune with the help of the Mumbai administration which was inaugurated in July 1917 by Lord Willingdon, Governor of Mumbai
 1919 main yahan aal-india conferes of oriental scolers naam se praachyavaadiyon kaa pratham akhil bhartiya adhiveshan yojit hua

 dhugahldwari-u0va03, yamakeshwar tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke paudi jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Cultural imperialism is a policy in which intentionally accusing, mixing, or encouraging another culture in another culture
 praaia duusari samskruti kisi shaktishaalee sainik desh kii hoti he jabaki jisame aropan ho rahaa ho vah durbal hota he
 It is also used to negate foreign influence
 It can be in any form like playing with Barbie doll
 upniveshwaad ke khatme ke baad raajnneetik or aarthik rup se prabhutvshaalee deshon ne apane purv upniveshon ke samaajon or unki jivan-shaileyon ko apratyaksh tareekon se apane varchasv ke tahat laane ke liye jin saanskrithik upayon kaa sahaara liya, unhen saanskrithik samrajyavad kii sangya di jaati he
 This means the promotion, dissemination and exportation of cultural values, ideas and codes of conduct that are considered 'superior'
 is sikke kaa ek doosraa pahalu bhi he jiske parinamswaroop saanskrithik samrajyavad garib or pichde hue deshon kii sthaneey samskritiyon ke mulyon or jivan-shaileyon ke vinaash or kramshah darkinar hote chale jane kaa kaaran banataa he
 According to the thesis of cultural imperialism, the sources of information system in the world are in the hands of the countries which have satellite broadcasting technology and through which the global flow of images, information, ideas, analysis and entertainment programs is controlled
 bhoomandaleekaran ke virdohi saanskrithik samrajyavad ko ek fikare kii tarah prayog karte hai
 However, in the field of culture-thinking there is also a debate on whether such a unilateral domination can be maintained over the field of culture; And is it not a simplified understanding of its complexity to consider globalization as the carrier of cultural homogeneity? vichaar-jagat main samrajyavad or samskruti ke sambandhon kaa vidhiwat udghaatan sabase pehle sattar or assi ke dashak main sahitya ke siddhantkaar edward said ke chintan main praachyavaad kii bahucharchit thisis ke zariye hua tha
 It is clear that Saeed identified cultural imperialism in the literary forms and scope of discourse
 assi ke dashak main hi ve
es
 nepaul ne is abhivyakti kaa kuch doosraa hi istemaal kiya
 He identified Islam as cultural imperialism in two of his works 'between the Believers: An Islamic Journey' and 'beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions among the converted Peoples'
 unka kahana tha ki islam main saanskrithik vividhta ko jor-jabardastee apane rang main rangne kii pravriti he
 In the nineties, the concept of cultural imperialism began to develop as a criticism of the dominance of American corporations on the global media world
 africa, asia, laathini america or duniya ke anya bhaagon main tivi darshakon ke saamne subah se shaam tak sirf america or europee saanskrithik utpaadon kii khuraaq hi parosi jaati thi
 It was clearly visible to the media experts that Western countries are exporting their made-in-tv serials and other programs to the poor countries for less than the cost
 bhoomandaleekaran kii prakriya ke baad saanskrithik samrajyavad kii is paribhaasha main kuch tabdili aayi
 This change led to the notion of Americanization
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki america khan-paan, rahan-sahan or jivan-style ke vibhinn roopon ne viksit europee samaajon par bhi apni chhap chhodani shuru kar di
 Europe and the United States were previously active in this project
 americakaran ke vichaar ko 1997 main ‘farren policy’ naamak patrika main clinton prashasan ke saath jude rah david rathcof ke lekh ‘in prez of cultural imperializam?’ ke prakaashan ke baad or hawa mili
 Rathkoff, associate professor of international affairs at Columbia University and managing director of Kissinger Associates, posited the cultural version of imperialism in this article as a positive assertion that it should be adopted voluntarily or coercively, through cultural diversity and ecological diversity
 Diversity can be protected
 rathcof kaa tark duniya main samskruti ke naam par hone vaale raktapaat or narsanhaaron kaa hawala de kar kahata he ki sari duniya main sahishnutaa ko badhaava diya janaa chahie
 Both types of aspects exist within cultural diversity
 sahishnutaa ko protsaahit karne vaale uske pahaluon kaa vikaas kiya janaa chahie or uske kilaaf khadey hone vaale ayaamon kaa behichak unmoolan kar diya janaa chahie
 Rathkoff also had no hesitation in accepting that the use of the Internet, globalization, and the English language were increasing America's cultural influence
 saanskrithik samrajyavad kii thisis ko sattar ke dashak main hue kuch samaajavaigyanik adhyayanon ke hawaale se bhi pusht kiya jaataa he
 Dorfman and Mattelart's How to Read Donald Duck, published in 1975, shows how racial stereotypes of 'other' nationalities are used through cultural products such as comics and animation
 isi tarz par tivi vigyapanon or upabhokta samskruti ke adhyayanon ne pashchimi samskritiyon kii shreshthata sthapit karne vaali poonjeewaadi saanskrithik pariyojna ne prakaash daalaa
 However, not all critics and scholars of capitalism are ready to accept such conclusions
 gramshi ke siddhanton kii roshni main samskruti kaa adhyayan karne vaale vichaarkon kii manyata he ki samskruti kaa kshetra raajnneeti or arthniti kii tarah adhinsth nahin kiya ja saktaa
 There are different types of resistance capabilities on the basis of which a kind of cultural politics is born
 is pratirodh ke prabhaav main rashtriya sarkarein pashchimi media utpaadon ko asweekaar bhi kar detii hai
 Some scholars of globalization have also criticized the urge for unilateral flow of culture
 unka kahana he ki bhoomandaleey vyavastha kaa vikaas kahin zyaada pechida nazaaraa pesh kar rahaa he
 Cultural flows are taking place from different directions
 unki sanrachanaayen bhi mahaz pashchimi yaa america yaa poonjeewaadi yaa upabhoktavaadi na ho kar jatil kism kii hai
 If on one hand there are American programs like CNN News, 'friends', 'sex and the City' and 'desperate Housewives', on the other hand there are cultural flows like Japan, Latin America and India
 in adhyetaon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki jahaan ‘samrajyavaadee’ kaarykram dekhe bhi ja rahe hai, vahaan yah maananaa anuchit hoga ki darshak unhen niskriy rup se aatmsaat kar lete hai
 The impact of local cultures and circumstances on the audience should not be underestimated
 america serial ‘dalas’ par kii gayi vistrut shodh se pataa laga he ki vibhinn rashtriyatayen or asmitaayen uske alag-alag taatpary grahan karti hai
 In addition, new media technologies and changing patterns of media ownership have also weakened the possibilities of unilateral cultural imperialism

 He was initiated into Buddhism in Sri Lanka in 1930 and since then he has become 'rahul' from 'ramodar Sadhu' and is called Sankrityayan due to Sankritya gotra

 Later, when he turned to Marxism, he sharply criticized the power-laden facilities that entered the Communist Party of the erstwhile Soviet Union and cited them as the cause of the movement
 san 1947 main akhil bhartiya sahitya sammelan ke adhyaksh rup main unhone pehle se chape bhaashan ko bolne se manaa kar diya evam jo bhaashan diya, vah alpsankhyak samskruti evam bhashaai sawaal par communist party kii nitiyon ke vipareet tha
 As a result, he was denied membership of the party, but his attitude did not change

 He believed that a nation is dumb without language

 Differences of opinion keep going, this does not reduce Rahul's deliverables and importance

 "this was the reason that Rahul, who considered the whole world his home, reached his maternal grandfather again in 1943, after leaving home in 1910

 The familiar voice of an elderly man in his birthplace made Rahul proud
 unhone apni diary main iskaa ullekh bhi kiya he- ‘‘lahore naanaa ne jab yah kaha ki ‘are i jab bhaagat jaay t bhagaiya girat jaay’ tab mere saamne apana bachapan naachne laga

 ’’ Rahul Sankrityayan with a wandering nature was such a genius of universal vision, who had equal hold on literature, history, philosophy and culture
 vilakshan vyaktitv ke adbhut manishi, chintak, darshanik, sahityakar, lekhak, karmyogi or saamaajik kranti ke agradoot rup main rahul ne jindagi ke sabhi pakshon ko jiya
 That is why his creationism is not pure artistic literature, but it is inspired by society, civilization, culture, history, science, religion, philosophy, etc
, which attacks the orthodox assumptions and by organizing the progressive forces of society by becoming relative to life
 It shows the path of struggle and mobility
 aise manishi ko apane jivan ke antim dinon main ‘smriti lop’ jaisi avasthaa se guzarana padaa evam ilaaj hetu unhen masco bhi le jaaya gaya
 But who has tied the stroller, he returned to Delhi from Moscow in April 1963 and on 14 April 1963, at the age of seventy, his journey from sanyas to communism was completed in Darjeeling, but his life philosophy and wandering nature today Is also alive among us
 rahul ji ghumkkadi ke bare me kehete hai: Rahul Sankrityayan is among those distinguished literary writers who lived both life and literature in a way
 unke jivan ke jitne mod aaye, ve unki tark buddhi ke kaaran aaye
 All the paths he followed in his life, except the childhood situation and other limitations, were searched by the insinuation of his inner self
 jis raah ko rahulji ne apanaaya use nirbhay hokar apanaaya
 There was neither a dilemma nor a fog of uncertainty

 There was no question of convenience-inconvenience in this walk

 He continued to expand his experience and scope of study

 He was also given the adjective of world tourist
 unki ghumkkadi pravriti ne kaha ’’ghumkkadon sansar tumhaare swaagat ke liye bekaraar he
 "his travel experiences have been points of inspiration in the creation of many texts
 na keval desh main varan videshon main bhi unhone yatraayen kii, durgam path paar kiye
 Some of the names of this class are Ladakh Yatra, Lanka Yatra, 125 yrs in Tibet, My Europe Tour, Darjeeling Introduction, Nepal, Kumaon Jaunsar, Dehradun etc

 Rahul is a rare symbol of outward journey and inner journey
 gyaan kii khoj main ghoomte rahanaa rahulji kii jeevancharya thi
 His vision always looked for development
 bhashaa or sahitya ke sambandh main rahulji kehete hai- ’’bhashaa or sahitya, dhara ke rup main chalata he fark itnaa hi he ki nadi ko ham desh kii prishthbhumi main dekhte hai jabaki bhashaa desh or bhoomi donon kii prishthbhumi ko liye aage babbti he
 xxrep 5 
 It is only by looking at the chronology that we see its development more clearly
 rugveda se lekar 19veen sadi ke ant tak kii gadhy dhara or kavy dhara ke sangrahon kii aavashyaktaa he
 '' rahulji kaa puraa jivan sahitya ko samarpit tha
 He had chosen the path of literature-writing long back
 satyavrath sinha ke shabdon main - ’’vaastavik baat to yah he ki rahulji ne kishoravastha paar karne ke baad hi likhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Just as his feet did not stop, the writing of his hand also did not stop

 This was his dream for India to get independence and to realize this dream, he jumped fearless in the Non-cooperation movement
 shaheedon kaa balidaan unhen bheetar tak jhakzorta tha
 He had said in one of his speeches: "the blood of those who were martyred in the chauri-chaura incident will be the sandalwood of the country and the mother
" ‘‘ There was no narrowness in Rahulji's personality like abstinence
 vigat ko jaananaa ore usamen paithna, vartmaan kii chunauti ko samajhnaa or samasyaon se sangharsh karnaa, bhavishya kaa swapn sanvaarana-yah rahulji kii jivan paddati thi
 The meaning of the past was not just for them to know history, but also to understand and know Prakrit history
 itihaas kaa unhone naye arth main upyog kiya
 In his words, - "soon i came to know that i should take up writing historical novels 


 The reason is that by bringing forward progressive efforts of the past, inspiration can be created in the readers' hearts towards ideals
" is
 ‘‘ unki anek kritiyaan jaise, satmi ke bachche, jonk, bolga se ganga, jayayodhey, singh senapati aadi is baat ke parichaayak hai ki rahulji itihaas, puraatatv, parampara, vyateet or ateet ko apni nijee vivechna de rahe the
 Rahulji's history-vision was unique
 ve usamen vartmaan or bhavishya kii kadyaan jodte the
 History was not merely a description of what happened to him
 usamen se ve darshanik chintan kaa aadhaar dhundte the
 Rahul ji had great reverence for the whole world literature
 vah sahitya chaahe itihaas se sambandhit ho, yaa samskruti se, aadhyatm se sambandhit ho yaa yatharth se-sabko ve shodharthi kii tarah parakhte the
 The urge to see the international and national perspective in his progressiveness was that he was in the sight of an alien civilization
 ve apni bhashaa, apane sahitya ke pujari the
 Whether that literature is Sanskrit, Hindi or Urdu, Bhojpuri
 rashtriya chetana ke sandarbh main ve kehete the ki ’’yadi koi ’’ganga maia‘‘ kii jai bolne ke sthaan par ’bolga‘ kii jai bolne ke liye kahe, to main ise pagal kaa pralaap hi kahoonga
 '' boliyon or janapadiya bhashaa kaa sammaan karnaa rahulji kii swabhaavgat visheshta thi
 She loved Bhojpuri
 kyonki vah unki maati kii bhashaa thi
 He considered the folk theater tradition as the carrier of culture
 lokanataka or lokmanch kisi bhi janandolan main apni shashakt bhoomika nibhaate hai, yah drushti rahulji kii thi
 That is why he composed Bhojpuri plays
 isamen unhone apana naam ’’rahul baba‘‘ diya
 In many places in these plays and songs in protest against social inequality, poignant utterances have been said
 betaa or beti ke bhedbhaav par kahi gai ye panktiyaan drushtavy hai- ’’eke maai bapta se ek hi udwa main duunon main janamavaan bhail re purakhwa, put ke janamavaan main naach or sohar hola bati janam dhare sog re purakhwa
 He brought these Bhojpuri plays to the ideological plane and highlighted the tone of social change in the language
 gyaan kii itani teevr pipaasa or jan-chetana ke prati nishtha ne rahulji ke vyaktitv ko itnaa prabhaa-mandal diya ki use maapna kisi aalochak kii samarthy ke pare he
 Apart from this, what was the biggest feature - it was that even after reaching the highest peak of fame and praise, he was a gentle human being, Rahulji was the creator of linguistic unity
 vah sampradayik sadbhaav ke samarthak the
 Known for many languages
 ve har bhashaa or uske sahitya ko mahatv hi nahin dete the, varan use apnaane kii baat kehete the
 Despite being an exclusive lover of Hindi, he valued Urdu and Persian writers, saying, "sauda and Aatish belong to us
" gaalib or daag hamaare hai
 Certainly if we reject them, then nowhere else in the world will they find their own caller
 ‘‘ Rahulji was a wonderful speaker
 unka bhaashan pravahpurn or sthaayee prabhaav daalane vaala hota tha
 Once Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi had praised Rahulji's speech power, he said, "I speak with confidence in seminars, ceremonies, conferences, but the meeting, conference or seminar in which Mahapandat Rahul Sankrityayan is there, i am agreeable to speak there
 i am unke vyaktitv evam agaadh vidvatta ke samaksh apane ko bouna mahasoos karata hoon
 "this appreciation of Dwivediji is even more important because Dwivediji himself was an extraordinary speaker of Hindi and an extraordinary scholar
 rahulji kii kritagya bhaavana unki pustak ’jinka main kritagya‘ main dekhne ko milti he
 In the foreword, he has written, "I am grateful to whom" i want to overcome the debt that these elders and friends have over me
 unamem se kitne hi is sansar main nahin hai
 They cannot see these lines
 inamen sirf vahi nahin hai jinase maine maargdarshan paaya tha
 Rather, there are also men whose life happened in the form of mental strength in life
 kitno se bina unki jaankaree, unke vyavhaar or bartaav se maine bahut kuch siikhaa
 Man should be grateful
 ‘‘ Rahulji's personality was so multifaceted that it is a pain to tie him to the periphery of words
 unka adhyayan or lekhan itnaa vishaal he ki kai-kai shodharthi bhi milakar kaary karen to bhi shram or samay kii koi ek seemaa nirdhaarit nahin kii ja sakati
 He was such a creative man with a sharp writing and sharp eyes, who had touched the high peaks of fame in his lifetime
 rahulji shabd-samarthy or sarthak-abhivyakti ke murtiman rup the
 Rahulji gave a lot of love to Hindi
 unheen ke apane shabd he, ’’maine naam badla, veshbhusha badali, khan-paan badla, sampradaay badla lekin hindi ke sambandh main maine vichaaron main koi parivartan nahin kiya
 Rahul Gandhi's views are very relevant today
 unki uktiyaan sutara-rup main hamaara maargdarshan karti hai
 Rahul ji also gave the name of Khadi dialect to Hindi
 hindi ke prasang main vah kehete hai: a postage stamp worth 100 paise was issued by the Indian Postal Service Department in memory of Rahul Sankrityayan on the occasion of his birth centenary in 1993
 patna main rahul sankrutyaayan sahitya santhaan kii sthapana kii gai he
 There is also a museum of things related to him
 uttar pradesh ke azamgarh jile ke pandaha gaanv main rahul sankrutyaayan sahitya sangrahalay kii sthapana kii gai he, jahaan unka janm hua tha
 There is also a bust of him there
 sahityakar prabhakar maavche ne rahulji kii jeevani likhi he or unke vyaktitv ke us hisse ko ujagar kiya he, jisase log anbhigya the
 This book was first published in 1978
 iskaa anuwaad angrezi, roosi aadi anek videshi bhashaaon main bhi prakashit hua
 Many of Rahulji's books have been translated into English, his works have become popular in many foreign languages like Chinese, Russian etc
 unhen 1958 main sahitya academy puraskaar, tathaa 1963 main bharat sarkaar ke padmabhushan alankaran se vibhooshit kiya gaya
 Much has been written from time to time regarding Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan
 falswaroop padhane kii drushti se un par paryaapt saamagree uplabdh he, kintu shrinivas sharma kii pustak 'rahul kaa sangharsh' ek pruthak kone par kendrit he
 This angle is to keep the flow of uninterrupted struggle flowing in Rahul's life and work
 pustak main lekhak ke atharah niabandh sankalit hai
 Of these, the first four are related to the total tradition of Rahulji, his parents, his first marriage and the posture of rejection and rebellion present in his teenage mind
 aage aane vaale nibandhon main unke ghumkkad swabhaav, bhashaa, sahitya tathaa gyaan ke anya kshetron main unki khojon evam uplabdhiyon, buddha dharm tathaa darshan ke prati unke jhukaav tathaa diksha, marxvad, kisaan andolan aadi ko lekar vyapak charchaa hui he

 The book has become interesting

 Oil painting is the name of the marking of the picture in which oil-dyed paint is used
 19veen shatee ke purv europe main hi iskaa prayog adhik hua, purvi deshon main tel madhyam se us kaal main chitrankan kaa koi ullekhneey pramaan praapt nahin he
 Although oil varnish making is mentioned in the 8th century "manuscript of Luke", its use with colors is first mentioned by Theophilus, Eraclius, and Peter the Saint Ademar in the 12th century
 ye teenon europe main alps parvat ke uttar ke nivasee the
 In Italy, oil painting was done long before these, it is believed, says that Florence's famous painter Giotto sometimes used oil medium
 eastlake kaa kathan he ki "germany, france, italy or england main kam se kam 14veen sadi me tailchithran prachlit tha
 "but the developed form of oil medium starts to appear from the 15th-16th century
 kintu yah dharna bhi prachlit he ki dach chitrakaar jaan phan aayak ne hi tel madhyam se chitrankan shuru kiya tha
 The oil medium is simpler than other mediums and transparent colors are the most transparent in it, so they look beautiful
 pani kaa bhi koi asar tel chitron par fouran nahin hota
 This is why this medium is so popular
 tailchithran main aamtaur se astr chadhe canvas par tel main ghonte gaye gadhe chipchipe rangon ko burush se lagaaya jaataa he
 Mostly flaxseed and poppy oil are used for this
 telon kaa chunaav vibhinn deshon main ruchi or aavashyaktaa par nirbhar karata he
 The earlier painter Neetanusa used to prepare his colors before he started his degree, but for the last 100 years, like the aquatic colors, oil colors are also available in tubes
 bijon ko bina garm kiye hue nikaala hua alsi kaa tel dhoop or hawa me shodhakar prayog kiya jaae to usamen rang maile nahin dikhte or tikte bhi zyada hai
 To dilute the colors and to dry quickly, earlier used to mix linseed or turpentine oil, but nowadays bright colors are not preferred, so only mix turpentine oil or petrol by not mixing linseed oil
 canvas sooti kapade kaa athwa san kaa banaaya jaataa he
 Its surface is rough or flat according to different interests and needs
 canvas ke alaava gatte, kaagaj, kaach, lakdi, taanbe, jaste kii chaadaren or diwaar par bhi astr chadhaakar tel madhyam se chitrankan kiya jaataa he
 Many painters are also using plied, hardboard, aluminum and asbestos etc
 as they are accessible and cheap and can be found in large sizes
 astr banane ke liye jis cheez par chitra bananaa he us par sares kaa halakaa lep chadhaate hai, suukh jane par, safed rang, alsi kaa tel or varnish milakar aavashyaktaanusaar do teen kot lagaae jate hai
 There have been different prescriptions in different periods of preparation of land and different painters
 canvas ko ek chaukhate par taana jaataa he
 Nowadays, different varieties of canvas are found ready in the market
 pracheen kaal kaa canvas yaa anya vastuon kii jameen kaa rang kuch katthi rangath kaa hota tha par aajkal ke chitrakaar safed rang kii jameen pasand karte hai
 Made of pig hair, long handled, flat and round burush is more common, but some painters prefer burush made of sable hair for flat and soft marking
 rangon ko mahogany kii lakdi athwa kaach yaa chini mitti kii ek plate par churi se milaayaa jaataa he
 These plates and knives have different samples
 pracheen kaal main rang sipiyon or pyaalon main bhi rakhe jate the
 It is customary to make oil paintings mostly on "easel" and stand still
 europe main to anya chitra bhi khadey hokar banaae jate hai
 But in this medium, there is a facility to work exclusively from standing, because pictures can be seen from time to time even if necessary and colors do not apply to the body
 pracheen chitrakaar canvas par pehle angoor kii belon ke koyale se rekhankan kar lete the, phir keval kisi ek rang se "shed" aadi lagaakar chitra ko puraa kar lete the
 After this, thin layers of colors were applied in it, so that the color of the bottom was also reflected
 isi tarah dhire dhire vaanchhneeya prabhaav praapt hone tak rang lagaae jate
 Rambran Rubens and Titties were unmatched in this type of notation
 kala ke anya gunon ke alaava burush kaa daksh prayog unke chitron kii visheshta he jo keval tel chithran main hi sambhav he
 Nowadays, many painters prefer to work on canvas or other surfaces with a straight knife, not using burush
 aisa keval apni ruchi or style ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This type of painting is very thick and effective
 par isamen badi dakshata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he kyonki burush se ankit chitra kii bhanti is prakaar ke chitron ko ek baar bighad jane par sudhaarna sambhav nahin
 After the painting was completed, the old painters applied varnish on it after a few months, so that it was unaffected by seasonal changes
 varnish se chitron main kuch chamak bhi aa jaati he
 Varnish is rarely used by any painter nowadays, as glow in colors is not preferred nowadays
 tel madhyam se bane chitron kaa sabase bada dosha yah hota he ki kuch kaal ke pashchaat ve pile padane lagate hai
 Pictures kept in moisture and dark turn yellow even more quickly
 rang kii pehali tah main kam tel ho or baad vaali main zyada tathaa ek tah suukh jane ke baad hi duusari tah lagaai jaae to rang baad main chatakhte nahin hai
 By applying wax varnish on the back side of the canvas, the canvas lasts longer and the colors are protected
 bharatvarsh main tel ke rangon kaa prayog europea chitrakaaron dwaara 1800 i ke lagbhag shuru hua
 The name of King Ravivarma of Travancore is notable among the early Indian oil painters
 bharatvarsh main vishesh rup se shabih chithran ke liye tel madhyam pasand kiya jaataa he
 From the middle of the 19th century, religious images were made on glass through this medium in Trichinapalli
 aajkal ke chitrakaar tailchitron kii apeksha phir se jaleey or andey kii zardi ke saath ghonte rangon ko pasand karne lage hai
 Paintings made of these colors are more durable
 fasalon ke saath-saath pedo evam jhaadiyon ko samuchit prakaar se lagaakar dono ke laabh praapt karne ko krishi vaaniki kaha jaataa he
 It combines diverse technologies of agriculture and forestry to ensure diversified, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use
 idhan ke kaam main aane vaale vrikshon kaa lagaana bhi bahut jaruri he
 Due to the lack of fuel, farmers make about half of their cattle by burning cow dung cakes
 yadi eendhan ke liye paryaapt vriksh laga die jaaen to sara gobar khaad ke kaam aayega
 Not only this, these trees will also protect the land from wind and water
 gaanv kii shaamilaat bhoomi, jo pashuon ko charaane ke liye charaagaah ke rup main kaam main laai jaati he, vriksh lagane ke liye sabase acchhee he
 Even in old fallow land, which is not used for farming, trees can be planted
 vriksh lagane or unki dekhbhaal kaa sara kaary panchayaton kii nigaraanee main ho saktaa he
