050 computer vigyaan main ek software sarthak kramadeshon or zaruri soochnaaon kaa ek aisa tantra he jo computer ke yantransh or duusare softwaron ko aadesh dekar kramadeshak kaa manachaaha kaam karata he
 In practice, if a computer is defined, then we can call hardware as human body and software as its soul
 hardware computer ke hisson ko kehete hai, jinhen ham apni aankhon se dekh sakate hai, chhu sakate hai athwa aujaaron se unpar kaary kar sakate hai
 This is the real substance
 iske vipareet software koi padaarth nahin he
 These are the information, commands or methods on which the computer hardware works
 computer hardware software se parichit hote hai athwa software computer ke hardware se parichit evam unpar aadhaarit hote hai
 Earlier, there was only one computer system for a task and it was given programs at the mechanical level, which was economical to change
 takanic ke vikaas ke saath aise yantransh bananaa takneekee rup se sambhav or aarthik rup se laabhadaayak ho sakaa
 It was very difficult to program early computer systems because at that time the theory that software was also in the initial state of a set of information which was safe in the memory of a device
 tab 'panch card' naamak saadhaaran se yantransh par computer ke yantransh ko diye jane vaale kramadesh ke nirdesh sidhe likhe jate the
 All instructions were given to the computer software with the help of only two digits - '0' and '1'
 ise dwaidh nirdesh kehete he, dwaidh rup ke hi kramadeshon ko hi yantransh lagu kar saktaa he
 In technical terms, there are three types of software
 “system software” yah ek aisa program hota he, jinka kaam system arthath computer ko chalaanaa tathaa use kaam karne laayak banaae rakhana he
 System software adds life to the hardware
 oparating system, compiler aadi system sofyware ke mukhya bhaag hai
 'application software' is called programs that are written to perform core tasks based on our computer

 Seven types of intellectual property rights are discussed in TRIPS
 Three types of rights, ie copyright, trade secret, and patents, affect computer software
 software ko patent karaane kaa mudda vivaadaaspad he tathaa kuch kathin bhi
 We have discussed it separately in patents and computer software
 object code computer ko chalaata he or yah sadaa prakashit hota he, parantu kya yah kisi chiz kaa varnan he athwa nahin is bare main shankaa thi
 Under the TRIPS agreement, it was said that computer programs should be protected like copyright
 isaliye object code hamaare desh main tathaa sansar ke anya deshon main isi prakaar se surakshit kiya gaya he
 Object code of a computer program is published, but not everyone's source code is published
 jin kamputer program ke sorce code prakashit kiye jate hai unamem to ve copirite se surakshit hote hai
 But computer programs whose source code is not published are protected like trade secret
 sorce code se object code compail karnaa aasaan he; yah hameshaa kiya jaataa he or isi tarah program likhaa jaataa he
 But the opposite is that it is impossible to find the source code from the object code, but it is very difficult and expensive
 is par reverse ingeneering kaa kanoon bhi lagu hota he
 That is why the source code is not published
 ise gopneey rakh kar, ise zyada aasaani se surakshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Reverse engineering is also an interesting subject, more on this sometime
 open sorce sauftware main sorce code hameshaa prakashit hota he
 What kind of authority its writers have over it depends on the terms of the licenses under which they are published
 open sorce sauftware main kuch license kii sharten use copileft karti hai
 It is also known as free software or GPOLD software
 in software ko koi bhi vyakti muft main downlod kar saktaa he, istemaal kar saktaa he, vitareet kar saktaa haievam isame apni jarurat ke mutabik badlaav bhi kar saktaa he
 Open source software is a wonderful tool of technology, science and art, not just mechanical content

 He was the chief commander in Akbar's army
 unhone amer ke mukhya mahal ke nirmaan karaayaa
 The great historian Colonel James Tod has written- "mansingh, the heir of Bhagwan Das, was given the best position in the court of Akbar
 

maansingh ne urisa or assam ko jeet kar unako badshaah akbar ke adheen bana diya
 raja maansingh se bhaybheet ho kar kabul ko bhi akbar kii adheenta sweekaar kerani paddy thi
 As a result of these actions, Mansingh was appointed as the ruler of Bengal, Bihar, South and Kabul
 " When Akbar's general Man Singh Solapur was returning after conquering Maharashtra, Mansingh thought of meeting Pratap
 pratap us vaqt kumbhalgarh main the
 Maharana Pratap had to manage his welcome on the sails of Udaisagar in Udaipur after passing his kingdom within Mewar
 After the reception and mutual interaction, it was time for lunch
 maharaja maansingh bhojan ke liye aaye kintu maharana ko na dekh kar aashcharya main pad gayi
 When he asked Maharana's son Amarsingh for this reason, he told that 'maharana saheb has a headache, so he is unable to support you on food
 ' According to some historians, this incident also became the reason for the battle of Haldi valley
 akbar ko rana pratap ke is vyavhaar ke kaaran mewar par akraman karne kaa ek or mauka mil gaya
 In 1576 AD, he was set on a campaign to punish Maharana Pratapsingh
 mughalon kii vishaal sena tiddi dal kii tarah mewar kii ore umad padi
 It also had Akbar's tremendous artillery with Mughal, Rajput and Pathan warriors
 akbar ke prasiddh senapati mahavat khan, asaf khan or maharaja maansingh ke saath akbar kaa shahjada saleem us mughal sena kaa sanchaalan kar rahe the, jisaki sankhya itihaaskaar 80 hajaar se 1 lakh tak bataate hai
 Rana Pratap fought that huge Mughal army with a handful of soldiers
 haldi ghati kii pili bhoomi raktranjit ho uthi
 On June 21, 1576 AD, seventeen thousand soldiers were killed in this fierce battle of one day between Pratap and the Mughal army in the Haldi valley near Gogunda
 yaheen rana pratap or maansingh kaa aamanaa-saamana hone par donon ke bich vikat yuddh hua - chetak kii peeth par savaar pratap ne akbar ke senapati maansingh ke hathi ke mastak par kaale-nile rang ke, arabi nasl ke ashv chetak ke paanv jamaa die or apane bhaale se sidhaa raja maansingh par ek pralayankari waar kiya, par tatkaal apane hathi ke majboot haude main chipak kar neeche baith jane se is yuddh main unki jaan batch gayi- houdah pratap ke durgharsh waar se buree tarah mud gaya
 Later, when Rana Pratap went away from the battleground of Haldighati on serious injuries, King Mansingh reached his palace and sent one of Pratap's famous elephant elephant Ramprasad to agra-darbar with other loot
 parantu maansingh ne chittorgarh ke nagar ko luutane kii ajna nahin di thi, yah jaan kar badshaah akbar in par kaaphi kupit hua or kuch vaqt ke liye darbar main inke aane par pratibandh tak laga diya
 In the words of James Todd- "in the days when Akbar was horribly ill and feared to die, Mansingh Khusro had laid a web of conspiracies to place him on the Mughal throne
 

uski yah cheshtaa darbar main sab ko gyaat ho gayi or vah bengal kaa shaasha bana kar bhej diya gaya
 After he left Khusro was imprisoned and kept in prison
 maansingh chatur or doordarshee tha
 He secretly supported Khusro
 Mansingh had an army of twenty thousand Rajputs under his control
 isliye badshaah prakat rup main uske saath shatruta nahin kii
 kuch itihaaskaaron ne likhaa he- "akbar ne das karod rupee de kar maansingh ko apane anukool bana liya tha
 " akbar shashan main jab raja bhagwantdas punjab ke soobedaar niyat hue, tab sindh ke paar seemaant praant kaa shashan unke kunwar maansingh ko diya gaya
 When Akbar's half-brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim died in his 30th year, Mansingh swiftly arrived in Kabul and got the residents there to get rid of the looting that followed the demise of the ruler and his sons Mirza Afrasiyab and Mirza Kankuvad of the kingdom
 He came to the court with other warlords
 akbar ne sindh nadi par kuch din thahar kar kunwar maansingh ko kabul kaa shashankarta niyukt kiya
 They bravely wiped out the robbers who were mercilessly holding the pass of Khyber

 raja bhagavaandas kii mrityu ho jane par raja maansingh jaipur ke singhaasana par baitha
 karnal james tod ne likhaa he- "maansingh ke shasankaal main amer rajya ne badi unnati kii
 mogul darbar main sammanit ho kar maansingh ne apane rajya kaa vistaar kiya usne anek rajyon par akraman kar ke jo aparimit sampatti luti thi, uske dwaara amer rajya ko shaktishaalee bana diya
 dhaularai ke baad amer, jo ek maamuli rajya samajha jaataa tha, maansingh ke samay vahi ek shaktishaalee or vistrut rajya ho gaya tha
 In the history of India, the Kachhwahs were not considered as knights, but during the time of King Bhagwan Das and Mansingh, the Kachwaha people showed their strength, might and glory from Khutan to the sea
 maansingh yon akbar kii adheenta main zarur tha, par uske saath kaam karne vaali rajput sena, badshaah kii sena se kahin adhik shaktishaalee samajhi jaati thi"
 Some other historians do not agree with this about Colonel James Tod
 His statement is that Mansingh was not the adopted son of Bhagwan Das, but he was the son of Bhagwant Das
 bhagavaandas or bhagwant das donon bhai the
 Mughal-history books reveal that on the orders of Akbar, his experienced officers Maharaja Mansingh, local subedar Qutubuddin Khan and Raja Bhagwant Das of Amer made a lot of research to capture Maharana Pratap in the forests of Gogunda and Mewar but eventually failed Akbar became very angry - even in the year 1577, both of them were 'locked up' diyodhi! " "muslim itihaaskaaron ne likhaa he hijri 1024 san 1615 isvi main maansingh kii bengal main mrityu hui, parantu duusare itihaaskaaron ke vivaran se pataa chalata he ki maansingh uttar kii taraf khilji badshaah se yuddh karne gaya tha jahaan vah san 1617 isvi main maaraa gaya

 After a misunderstanding, Gopal loses his temper and drives Prashant out of the house

 lekin di gargian ne yah bhi khabar di he ki zuma ne "videshi niveshkon ke hiton kii raksha karne kaa aashwaasan" diya he
 Zuma also got involved in a corruption-related controversy after his financial advisor, Schabir Shaik, was accused of corruption and fraud
 us samay lok abhiyojan ke rashtriya nideshak rahe bulilani ngakuka zuma or ANC mukhya sachetak tony yengeni ke khilaaf takat kaa durupyog karne ke iljaamon kii jaanch kar rahe the
 In 2004, Zuma became a prominent figure in the Schabir Shaik trial
 schabir shaike ek durban vyapaaree or zuma ke vittiya salaahkaar the, dakshin africa nausena ke durban main ek prastaavit waterfrant vikaas ke liye vailar varg ladaai ke jahaajon kii kharid main rishwatakhori or nakandla main zuma ke bhavy nivas par kiye gaye kharch ke sandarbh main unase sawaal kiya gaya
 During the trial, Shack was shown requesting a bribe of 500 000 rand per year for Zuma in support of Zuma's defense contractor Thomson CSF, which is recorded in the infamous "encrypted fax"
 2 june 2005 ko, shaike ko doshi paaya gaya or 15 saal kii sajaa sunai gai
 Judge Hillary Squires gives a detailed account of several transactions between Shack and Zuma, with a summary that "all the accused companies have been used to pay Jacob Zuma at one time"
 The media incorrectly quoted Squires' statement with the phrase "a generally corrupt relationship", while the exact same word does not exist in court transcripts
 is vaakyansh kii shuruyaat karne waalon kii pratiraksha main, shaike ke khilaaf faisle ke sampoorn pratilekh main vastav main zuma kaa zikr 471 baar hua he, "bhrasht" yaa "bhrashtachar" shabd kaa prayog 54 baar kiya gaya he or isamen aise 12 vaakya hai jinamein "bhrasht" or "zuma" donon shabdon kaa prayog ek saath he
 Later media sources changed the phrase to "mutually beneficial symbiosis", which was replaced by Article 235 of the verdict, which was: "to think it would be against common sense and ordinary human nature to benefit from the accusations of Zuma
" Was not realized, which was getting far more than before 1997; and even if nothing was ever said between them that could help mutually beneficial symbiosis Is installed, which can generate a sense of in only thanks to a series of continuing in accordance with the evidence was there, its conditions to start and these payments after the recipient
 " On June 14, 2005, President Thabo Mbeki removed Zuma from the post of vice-president, after media speculated about his future with deep speculation
 mabek ne sansad kii sanyukt baithak main kaha ki "yah mananeey up raashtrapati, sarkaar, hamaari yuva loktantric pranali or hamaare desh ke hit main sabase acha hoga ki mananeey jacob zuma ko unke prajatantr ke up raashtrapati or cabinet ke sadsy ke pad kii jimmedaariyon se mukt kar diya jaae
" tab zuma ne sansad ke sadsy ke pad se istipha de diya
 Following the Shack trial, Zuma was formally accused of corruption by the National Prosecuting Authority
 sthagan ke liye abhiyojan paksh dwaara daayar aavedan ke khaarij ho jane ke baad maamle ko petermarittsburg hai court se waapas le liye gaya
 Zuma's legal team continued to delay the action and despite Zuma's assertion that he wished to look into the matter in court, he managed to conceal some important evidence from the court that resulted in the prosecution's adjournment on the due date Had to file an application for 8 navambar 2007 ko supreme court of apil ne rashtriya abhiyog praadhikaran ke paksh main apana nirnay sunaaya jo zuma ke raksha dal dwaara kiye hue vibhinn khoj or jabti sambandhi kaaryon ke sambandh main tha or unke dwaara kiye gaye chaar apilon ko kaarij kar diya gaya
 The decision was in relation to obtaining a personal diary of a senior member of a French arms company by the National Prosecuting Authority, which provided information related to Zuma's corrupt practices, possibly while awarding an arms deal
 28 disambar 2007 ko, scorpian ne zuma par ucch nyaayalay main thag-vyapaar, kaale dhan ko vaid karne, bhrashtachar or dhokhadhadi ke vibhinn maamalon main abhiyog chalaaya
 a conviction and imprisonment of more than 1 year would have made Zuma ineligible for election to the South African Parliament and consequently he would have been disqualified for the presidency of South Africa
 4 agast 2008 ko zuma adaalat main haazir hue
 12 sitambar 2008 ko petermarittsburg nyaayadhish kris nikholson ke bataaya ki zuma par lage bhrashtachar ke aarope prakriyaatmak aadhaar par avaidh hai kyonki lok abhiyojan ke rashtriya nideshaalay ne aarope lagane kaa nirnay lene se pehle zuma ko abhyavedan prastut karne kaa mauka nahi diya or rajya ko kanoonee bhugtan karne ke nirdesh die
 Nikholson also stated that, he believed that political interference played a role in the decision to file charges again against Zuma, although he did not explain why he dismissed the allegations against Zuma as invalid
 nikholson ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki unka nirnay zuma ke aparaadh yaa nirparaadh se sambandhit nahin tha, balki yah keval ek prakriyaatmak aadhaar par tha
 Various media reports have misinformed that the charges against Zuma have been dismissed
 maamla yah nahin tha
 The NDPP was able to re-accuse Zuma, however, only once he was given the opportunity to present a representation to the NDPP, based on the ndpp's decision to do so
 In paragraph 47 of the judgment, Judge Nicholson wrote, abhyavedan ko sunne kii baadhyataa audi alterum partem ke siddhant kaa ek hissaa he
 The requirement is that a person who may be adversely affected by a decision may be given an opportunity to make a representation with a view to achieving a favorable outcome
 The affected person should usually be informed of the essence or elements of the case to which he or she has to respond
 adaalat ne yah nirdhaarit kiya ki NDPP ke samvidhan kii dhara 179 main ullikhit prakriya kaa paalan kar paane kii vifaltaa ne NDPP dwaara zuma par punah aarope lagane ke nirnay ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 Judge Nicholson found that various estimates could be made at the time of the allegations leveled against Zuma which corroborated the conclusion that it contained some degree of political interference by the executive branch of the government
 nyaayadhish nikholson apane nirnay ke para 210 main likhte hai, After the President's political defeat in Polokwane, the timing of the indictment by Mr Emsche on 28 December 2007 was the most unfortunate
 is pahalu ne, shri picholi jinhen swatantra or pratirakshit rahanaa chahie tha ke karypalika ke hastkshep se nilamban kiye jane kii ghatana ke saath milakar, mujhe yah vishwaas dilaa diya ki sabase sachcha nishkarsh yah he ki hanikaarak raajnneetik prabhaav jari he
 In Article 220 of the judgment, Judge Nicholson further wrote, raajnneetik hastkshep, dabaav yaa prabhaav ke sanketon se upar uth kar jo vyavhaar maine nirdhaarit kiye hai unamem ek chintajanak dhaancha he
 It began with the "political leadership" given by Minister Maduna to Mr
 Ngcuka when he refused to prosecute the applicant, whose crime was to talk to and meet with Thint representatives and other matters that i have referred to
 Given the rule of evidence, the court is bound to accept the conclusion that is least suited to the interest of the party who has special knowledge of the facts
 yah nishchit rup se yengeni maamle main ullikhit "suraag yaa suzav" ke raajnneetik hastkshep se adhik prabal he
 It is a matter of grave concern that such a process took place in New South Africa and prompted destruction under apartheid regime
 " The South African judiciary was severely criticized by Zuma's supporters before the hearing
 , jinamein paul nagobeni jaisi kuch pramukh kanoonee hastiyaan bhi shaamil thim, is sandarbh main, vidmbana yah thi ki dakshin africa nyaayapalika ko teesri baar zuma ke paksh main paaya gaya, jisame un par par lagaae gaye balaatkaar ke aarope se bari hona bhi shaamil tha
 The NDPP soon announced its intention to appeal against this decision
 thabo mabek ne petermarittsburg ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish kris nikholson ke nirnay par apil karne ke liye sanvaidhanik nyaayalay main ek halafanama daayar kiya: It was unfair for the court to come to such far-reaching "vexatious, scandalous and unfavorable" conclusions related to me, and to judge and condemn those conclusions based on the Zuma case
 meraa sammaan purna nivedan yah he kii nyaay ke hiton kii raksha, is maamle ko sudhaare jane main he
 These adverse findings led to the withdrawal of my name by my ANC party - a request that i have accepted as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years
 mujhe dar he ki yadi sudhara nahin gaya, to mujhe aage or pratikul prabhaav kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority, Talali Talali, told Pretoria by phone on 23 September, “we have received the papers
 yah vichaaradhin he
 " 12 janvari 2009 ko blomphontain ke supreme court of apil main is apil ke liye nirnay ko khaarij kar diya gaya
 Deputy Judge President Louis Harms had to decide on two aspects of the appeal
 The first aspect was whether Zuma had the right to be invited to make representations to the NPA before he decided to withdraw the bribery and corruption charges against him
 The second aspect was whether Judge Nicholson was correct in understanding the political interference given by then President Thabo Mbeki in the context of the npa's decision to impose charges on Zuma
 NPA ke faisle kii samiksha ke dauraan abhyavedan aamantrit karne ke sawaal par harms deepi ne paaya ki nikholson dwaara di gai samvidhan ke 179 khand kii vyakhya galat thi kyonki NPA kaa aisa koi daayitv nahin tha or isliye ve zuma par aarope lagane ke liye swatantra tha joki usne kiya
 On the question of Nikholson's argument given by Mbeki about political interference, Harms DP found that "the lower court has violated its rights"
 6 april 2009 ko, rashtriya abhiyog praadhikaran ne, abhiyojan paksh main gambhir dosha ke nae rahasyodghatan kii raushnee main, zuma or sah abhiyukt french hathiyaar company thint ke khilaaf sabhi aaropon ko waapas le liya
 The revelations were in the form of pieces of phone talk showing that Scorpion's president, Leonard mccarthy, and former National Director of Public Prosecutions, Bulleani Ngcuka, had conspired with Zuma about the timing of the prosecution, presumably Zuma's political The opponent was for the political benefit of President Thabo Mbeki
 aarope waapas lene kii ghoshnaa NPA ke kaaryakari adhyaksh, mokothedy ampshe dwaara kiya gaya, jinhonen is baat par jor diya ki aaropon kii vaapasi un durupayogon ke kaaran hui jise kanoonee prakriya ko "daagi" banaaya or yah doshamukti ke baraabar nahin he
 Soon after the announcement of the NPA, however, at least two political parties reported that they would consider legal action on their own if the charges were dropped
 democratic elliance ne baad main NPA ke faisle kii ek nyaayik samiksha karne kii apil daayar kii, jiske sandarbh main unke party ke netaa hellen jile ne spasht kiya ki ampshe ne "kanoon par aadhaarit nirnay nahin liya, lekin raajnneetik dabaav se bandhaa hua nirnay liya"
 9 june 2009 ko, is maamle kii sunwaayee kaa din tay kiya gaya
 While Zuma filed his response tentatively, Ampshe delayed the hearing of the case, requesting two extensions to present the npa's response
 NPA ke pravaktaa mthunzi mahaaga ne kaha ki ve kagajaat daakhil nahin karenge kyonki "bakaayaa maamle" aise hai jinhen hal kiya janaa baaki he
 District, the Democratic Alliance party chief, argued that Zuma's response was fundamentally wrong and "they have no constitutional basis"
 While legal challenges continued, a June 2009 poll showed that more than half of South Africans believe that President Jacob Zuma is doing a good job
 june 2009 ke ant main TNS research studies dwaara kiye gaye chunaav main yah zaahir ho gaya ki zuma ke anumodan str main lagaataar sudhaar hua he
 Nearly 57% of those polled said they think Zuma is a capable leader - up to 3% more than when the president was inaugurated in April 2009
 november 2008 main, purv raashtrapati thabo mabek kaa naam waapas le liye jane or zuma ke bhrashtachar ke aaropon kaa saamana karne ke bas kuch hi maheene baad, keval 36% dakshin africa hi unke vishay main sakaaratmak the
 In December 2005, Zuma was accused of raping a 31-year-old woman at her home in Forest Town, Johannesburg
 kathith peedita ANC ke ek mahatvapurn parivaar kii thi, vah zuma ke sangharsh ke dinon kediwangat saathi kii putree thi or ek aids kaaryakarta thi jise echivi positive se grasit mana jaataa tha
 Zuma denied the allegations and claimed that the sexual relationship was made by mutual consent
 aarope daakhil kiye jane se pehle hi, jaise hi navambar main balaatkaar ke aaropon ke bare main afvaahen udi, zuma kii raajnneetik sambhaavnaaen patan kii ore agrasar prathit hone lagi
 Most of his high level political supporters did not react to these new allegations in the same way that he had given against corruption charges

 As Zuma did during the trial, he continued to sing Lethu machine wami with the crowd and ANC Youth League and Bam Panthi Party Youth League spokespersons spoke in support of Zuma
 jaise-jaise balaatkaar kaa mukadmaa aage badta gaya, yah report saamne aati gai ki, dakshin africa vam panthi dal main is baat ko lekar baari matbhed tha ki zuma ke maamle ko or unke saath SACP ke sambandh ko kaise sambodhit kiya jaae

 Despite the defection of some former supporters, many Zuma supporters continued to protest outside the court, relentlessly rebuking the integrity and morality of the prosecutor, abusing a close friend of the accuser and throwing stones at another woman as the prosecutor The acts sparked criticism from anti-rape groups
 zuma ke pratirakshak dal ne peedit mahila ke yon ateet se sambandhit saboot pesh kiye or jor dekar kaha ki yah shaareerik sambandh donon kii sahamati se hua
 The prosecution insisted that the woman's lack of resistance was due to her being in a state of shock and that the relationship between the two was similar to the father-daughter relationship
 is mukademe ne tab raajnneetik vivaad bhi utpann kar diya jab zuma, jo us samay rashtriya aids parishad kaa netritv kar rahe the, ne yah sweekaar kiya ki unhone balaatkaar kaa aarope lagane vaali us mahila ke saath bina condom ke asurakshit sambhog kiya, yah jaanate hue bhi ki vah HIV positive thi
 He stated in court that he took a bath shortly thereafter "to reduce the risk of HIV infection"
 is bayaan kii ninda nyaayadhish, swasthya visheshgyon or aids kaaryakartaaon dwaara kii gai

 Because of his support among party elements, Zuma remained a powerful political personality, leading to a high position in the ANC even after his dismissal from the post of Vice President of the country
 november 2005 main, sanyojit vishleshkon ke ek panel ne is baat par sahamati jataai ki yadi zuma ko bhrashtachar ke aaropon main nirdosh paaya jaataa he, to 2009 main, desh ke raashtrapati pad kii daud main zuma ko haraana kisi anya sambhavit ANC pratyaashee ke liye mushkil hoga

 Zuma also deserves condemnation from religious and secular groups when he declares that the ANC will rule South Africa until Jesus returns and it is God's will to continue the anc's rule: ishwar chahta he ki ham is desh par shashan karen kyonki ham ek maatr aisa sanghathan hai jiske banane ke samay padariyon dwaara aashirwad diya gaya tha

 yahi kaaran he ki ham tab tak shashan karenge jab tak yishu waapas nahin aate
 hame hamaare shaharon ko kisi or ke dwaara shashan karne kii anumati nahin deni chahie jab ham swayan sattarudh hai
 Zuma later defended his remarks by saying that they were "political expressions": "talking about Jesus is not an insult to his name; it is actually a historical saying," and that is the ANC
 ' yah sirf ek raajnneetik abhivyakti he ki ham majboot hai or ek lambey samay tak majboot rahenge

 unhone police ke bhrashtachar ke maamle kaa bhi saamana yah kehete hue kiya ki "tum desh kaa bharosa ek aise insaan par nahin daal sakate ho jo swayan ek mujrim he

 This led to increased pressure from opposition parties and ANC alliance partner COSATU to do so
 
 ANC pravaktaa bryan sokutu ne kaha ki zuma kaa "maamla vishesh" he kyonki unke "bade parivaar" ke kaaran unhen sampatti ghoshit karne main mushkil pesh aa rahi hai

 Zuma revealed his interests shortly thereafter

 Dharamdas was a disciple of Kabir Das and his contemporary saint and Hindi poet
 dhani dharmadas ko chhattisgadhi ke aadi kavi kaa darja praapt he
 After Kabirdas, Harmadas was the greatest ninja of Kabirpanth
 sant dharamdas ko kabir ke shishyon main sarvapramukh maanane kii pravriti pai jaati hai, kintu ye unke thik samasamyik bhi nahin thaharte
 According to the table of the Kabirpanthi tradition of the 'chhattisgarhi branch' called by him, his emergence period does not seem to go before the second or first phase of the 17th century of Vikram Samvat, due to which he becomes a successor of Kabir
 isi prakaar katipay sampradayik granthon tathaa swayan inaki bhi kuch panktiyon dwaara inkaa unhen, jindarup main tathaa videhi banakar 'jhina paras' dikhalaate hue hi, maananaa, siddh hota he
 Apart from this, it is also clear from Gyandeepak of Dariya Saheb of Bihar that Kabir Sahib himself, as Dharamdas, had incarnated two hundred years back and started a new cult
 atev adhik sambhav he ki inhone unke adarsh evam upadeshon se vishesh prerana grahan karke hi unhen gururup main sweekaar kar liya ho
 Nevertheless, most of the followers of Kabir Panth believe in the direct meeting of these two and accordingly give their life circle
 kehete hai ki inkaa purv naam 'judaavan' tha or ye kasaughan baniyaa the, inkaa nivas sthaan bandhavgarh tha
 His wife's name was Amin and he also had two sons named Narayan Das and Chudamani, the first of whom was opposed to Kabir Sahib
 ye pehle vaishnavadharm main dikshit rah chuke the or inke guru kaa naam rupadas tha
 After traveling to many pilgrimages, in the third part of his life, he once saw Kabir Sahib in Mathura and then both met in Kashi
 iske ananthar kabir sahab kaa inke yahan banghgarh janaa, inhen upadesh dena tathaa inke dwaara kabir panth kaa prachaar kiya janaa bhi kaha gaya he
 Similarly, it is famous that he died in Puri where he lived with Kabir Sahib and his samadhi was also built here
 sant dharamdas dwaara rache anek granthon ke naam die jate hai or unamem adhiktar inkaa, kabir sahab ke saath, samvaad vaa prashnottar paaya jaataa he jisase inke dwaara unka rachit bhi hona purnat: siddh nahin ho paata
 a collection of his many retail books is titled 'dhani Dharamdas Ki Bani' published by Belvedere Press of Prayag
 vahaan par ye ek sagunopa bhakt ke rup main dikhalaai padate hai or inaki kabir sahab ke prati pragadh bhakthi evam shraddha prakat hoti he
 Kabir Sahib seems to be there with his presiding deity and accepts him as a master or a husband, with passion
 inke dwaara pradarshit bhaavon main hriday kii sachai lakshith hoti he tathaa inkaa apni ant:sadhana kaa varnan bhi bahut spasht va saral he
 Dadupanthi Raghavdas has given the names of seven of his disciples under his devotees and the first two of them namely Chudamani and the Chancellor have been referred to as 'naati'

 Just as there are many approaches in the definition of public administration, similarly there are two types of approaches regarding its nature
 pratham, vyapak drushtikon jise 'purna vichaar' athwa 'ekikrut vichaar' kaha jaataa he or doosraa sankuchit drushtikon jise 'prabandhkeey vichaar' kaha jaataa he
 According to the supporters of this idea, public administration is the sum of the activities used to implement and fulfill public policy
 is prakaar nishchit lakshya kii prapti hetu sampadit kii jane vaali kriyaaon kaa yoga hi prashasan he, chaahe ve kriyaayein, prabandhkeey athwa takneekee hi kyon na ho
 Broadly all the activities of the government, whether they are executive and legislative or judicial, are involved in public administration
 el
di
 hnite, vilson, dim or fifanor aadi lekhakon ne is vichaar kaa samarthan kiya he
 LD Hanaite has stated in unambiguous terms, "public administration is concerned with all those functions which are intended to fulfill or implement public policy
 “ is paribhaasha main shashan sambandhi sabhi kshetron kii vishesh kriyaayein aa jaati he, jaise patr-vitaran, saarvajanik bhoomi kaa vikray, kisi sandhi kii vaarta, ghayal karmchaaree ko kshatipurti dena, sankramak rog se biimaar bachche ko anya vyaktiyon ke sampark main aane se rokna, saarvajanik park main se kooda-karkat hataanaa, plutonium kaa nirmaan tathaa anu shakti ke prayog kaa anupaalan
 " is drushtikon ko apanaate hue fifanor ne kaha he, ”lok prashasan kaa arth he sarkaar kaa kaam karnaa chaahe vah kaary swasthya prayogshaala main eksre mashin kaa sanchaalan ho athwa taksaal main sikke bananaa ho
 Public administration means completing the work by coordinating the efforts of the people so that they can work together or complete their fixed tasks
 “ Proponents of this idea consider administration of only those people who carry out any enterprise related tasks
 prabandhkeey kaary kaa lakshya udhyam kii sabhi kriyaaon kaa ekikaran, niyantran tathaa samanvay karnaa hota he jisase sabhi kriyalap ek samanvit praytn jaise dikhaai dete hai
 Simon, Smithberg and Thomson are advocates of this view
 unke matanusaar, ”prashasan shabd apane sankuchit arthon main aacharan ke un aadarshon ko prakat karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he jo anek prakaar ke sahyogi samoohon main samaan rup se paae jate hai or na to us lakshya vishesh par hi aadhaarit hote hai jisaki prapti ke liye ve sahyog kar rahe hai or na un vishesh takneekee ritiyon par hi avalambit hai jo un lakshyon ke hetu prayog kii jaati hai
 "luther Gulick has also written in favor of this view," the administration is concerned with the completion of the work and the set objectives
 “ duusare shabdon main is vichaar ke samarthak lok prashasan ko keval karypalika shakha kii gatividhiyon tak hi simit kar dete hai
 Both these views differ from many aspects
 ekikrut vichaar main prashasan se sambandhit sabhi vyaktiyon ke kaary shaamil hai, jabaki prabandhkeey vichaar prashasan ko keval kuch ek upar ke vyaktiyon ke kaaryon tak hi simit karata he
 In other words, the integrated approach includes all kinds of managerial, technical and non-technical activities, while the managerial approach confines itself to the managerial functions of an organization
 ekikrut drushtikon ke anusaar lok prashasan sarkaar kii teenon shakhaon-karypalika, vidhanpalika tathaa nyaaypalika se sambandhit he
 But according to the managerial view, public administration is only concerned with executive functions
 in donon vichaaron main se kisi kii bhi purnatah upeksha nahin kii ja sakati
 The exact meaning of administration depends on the context in which the term is used
 dymock tathaa koining ne sabhi pakshon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue lok prashasan kii prakruti kaa saransh nikaalane kaa praytn kiya he
 According to him, lok prashasan ke kshetra sambandhi vichaar ko do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he- According to Willoughby, the field of public administration is concerned with- uparyukt vichaaron ke prakaash main lok prashasan ke kshetra ko ham nimna rup main varnit kar sakate hai- What is the basis of collective relations and how the person is able to fulfill those needs, it is a matter of public administration
 prashaskeey nirnyon par kin-kin tatwon kaa vyapak rup se prabhaav hota he, iskaa adhyayan ham lok prashasan main karte hai
 There is a great distinction among thinkers about the field of public administration
 multah matbhed in prashnon ko lekar he ki kya lok prashasan shaskeey kaamkaaj kaa keval prabandhkeey ansh he athwa sarkaar ke samast angon kaa samgr adhyayan? kya lok prashasan sarkari nitiyon kaa kriyanvayan he athwa yah niti-nirdhaaran main bhi prabhavi bhoomika adaa karata he
 Public administration is art or science - scholars differ on this subject
 lokprashasan ko vigyaan maanane waalo vichaarkon main luther, gulik, urvik, woodro wilson aadi pramukh hai
 According to them, the study of public administration is done in a systematic way in which hypothesis, collection of facts, confirmation of facts, classification of facts, comparative study, analysis, etc
, arrive at a definite conclusion using scientific methods
 is prakaar lok prashasan main in vaigyanik paddatiyon kaa upyog karke hi saamaanya niyam sthapit kiya jaataa he
 Like science, there are also some accepted principles in public administration such as unity of command, control area, Taylor's theory of scientific management, etc
 lok prashasan main viddhman dosha ko dur karne va prashasnic takanic ke vikaas hetu vigyaan kii tarah hi lokprashasan main bhi naveen prayog kiye jate he
 Along with this, technical knowledge also has priority in public administration
 ek vaigyanik kii bhanti ek kushal prashaasak ko bhi takneekee gyaan se yukt hona aavashyak he taaki vah apane dayitvon kaa kushaltapurvak nirvaah kar sake
 In this sense, public administration can be considered as science
 duusari or pro white, dow em pi sharma, artve tid jaise vichaarak lokprashasan ko kala kii shrenee main rakhte hai
 According to him, the development of public administration has also progressed gradually like art
 is drushti se lok prashasan bhi ek kala he jisame vibhinn yugon kaa vyavasthit adhyayan karte hue saamaanya niyam sthapit kiye gaye he
 Like an artist, an administrator can be successful and proven only on the basis of experience and practice
 jis prakaar kala kii safalataa kuch nishchit niyamo par aadhaarit hoti he usee prakaar lokprashasan main bhi niyamo ke abhaav main prashasko ke swechhacharita env prashasan ke swaroop vikrut hone kii sambhaavna bani rahati he
 Just as the principles of art change due to development, the process of development continues continuously in public administration and new rules are made

 ardhchaalak yuktiyaan un electranik avyavon ko kehete hai jo ardhchaalak padaarthon ke gun-dharmon kaa upyog karke banaaye jate hai
 Silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide are the main semiconductor materials
 adhikansh anuprayogon main ab un sabhi sthanon par ardhchaalak yuktiyaan prayog kii jane lagi hai jahaan pehle ushmainic yuktiyaan prayog kii jaati thim
 The semiconductor devices are based on electronic movement in the solid state, while the tube tips were based on the conduction of incubations in the high vacuum or gaseous state
 nirmaan ke aadhaar par ardhchaalak yuktiyaan mukhyatah do prakaar kii hoti hai - akeli yuktiyaan or ekikrut paripath The most important attraction of semiconductor materials is that their behavior can be controlled by contaminating them
 dooshan kii is prakriya ko dopigan kehete hai
 The conduction of semiconductors can be controlled by electrical field, light, heat, even pressure
 isaliye, ardhchalkon kaa upyog samvedakon ko banane main hota he
 The current flows through "free" electrons and "holes", also called charge carriers
 silicon jaise ardhchaalak main phosphorus yaa boron jaise tatwon ko daalkar dopigan kiya jaataa he, jisase ardhchaalak main uplabdh mukt electron yaa chhidron kii maatra kaaphi had tak batch jaati he
 When there are maximum holes in a contaminated semiconductor, it is called P-type semiconductor and when there are maximum electrons, it is called N-type semiconductor, where p or n are indicative of positive charge or negative charge charge carriers
 ardhchalkon kaa utpaadan or unke dopigan kii prakruya atyant hi niyantrit vaataavaran, jise faib kehete hai, main hoti he
 The pair between P-type and N-type semiconductors is called PN pair
 P-N jod se bane diod me P-prakaar or N-prakaar ke ardhchalkon ke bich ke jod main avakshay kshetra hota he jo vidyutdhara ke pravaah ko n se p kii ore nahi hone detaa, par p se n kii ore hone detaa he
 When the diode is front facing, where there is a higher electrical operating power towards P, then the current flows
 iske vipareet, uttkram abhinath diod main dhara pravaah naa ke baraabar hota he
 By adding light to the semiconductor, the electron-hole pairs increase, which increases the conductivity
 is pratibhaas kaa phayda uthaakar photo diod banaaya gaya
 Combined semiconductor diodes can produce light, such as light-emitting diodes and laser diodes
 transistaron ke pramukh prakaar, dwidhruviya jod transister do p-n jodon, n-p-n yaa p-n-p samagrakriton main banate hai
 The middle segment, also known as the "base", is narrow
 anya khandon ko utsarjak or samahrta kehete hai
 The intrusion of charge between the base and the emitter causes a difference in the quality of the base-collector, thus, current flows even though the base-collector is in front
 base-utsarjak ke chote se pravaah ke badlaav ke anupaat se kai guna adhik pravaah base-samahrta ke bich miltaa he
 Another type of transistor is the field effect transistor - the conductivity of this semiconductor is increased and reduced by the effect of the electric field
 vidyut kshetra ke prabhaav se mukt electron or yaa chhidron kii maatra tak batch jaati he, is prakaar chaalakata batch jaati he
 If you use an inversely connected PN pair to apply this electric field, it is called a pair field effect transistor; If you use metal oxide to apply this electric field, then the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor is made aaj mosphate sabase mahatvapurn ardhchaalak yukti he
 The "gate" electrically generates the electric field, thereby controlling the conductivity of the channel between "source" and "drain"
 is channel ke do prakaar hai, P-channel yaa N-channel 
 Although the metal got its name from the phosphate, polysilicon is used today
 ardhchaalak yuktiyon ke nirmaan main silicon kaa sabase adhik prayog hota he
 Its main properties as compared to other materials are low cost of raw materials, ease of manufacture and wide temperature operating range
 vartmaan main ardhchaalak yuktiyon ke nirmaan ke liye pehle silicon ko kam se kam 300mm kii chaudai ke baul ke nirmaan se kiya jaataa he, taaki is se itani hi chaudi vefer ban sake
 The use of germanium was widespread at first, but silicon has taken its place due to its extreme hypersensitivity
 aaj jarmenium or silicon ke kudhatu kaa prayog akasar ativegashali yuktiyon ke nirmaan me hota he; ai bi em ese yuktiyon kaa pramukh utpaadak he
 The use of gallium arsenide is also widespread in the manufacture of ultra-efficient devices, but this material does not form wide boules, which makes it expensive to make semiconductor devices from gallium arsenide compared to silicon
 anya padaarth jinka prayog yaa to kam vyapak he, yaa un par anusandhan ho rahaa he: Transistors are a fundamental part in the formation of logic gates
 punasch, tark get, ankiy prapath ke moolbhoot nirmaan-avyav hai
 Microprocessors such as transistors in digital circuits work like transistors
 udhaaharan ke liye, mossphate par vidyut sanchaalan shakti ko lagane se nirdhaarit hota he ki switch band hota he yaa khulata he
 The transistors used in analog circuits are intended for amplification and oscillation rather than as switches
 iname nivesh or nirgam, dono hi anuroop hote hai
 Power semiconductor devices are used to generate high volt or current
 computer kaa esampies yaa motor drive aadi main power ardhchaalak yuktiyon kaa prayog karnaa pasta he
 
 power ankiy prapath, jinhe "smart" power yukti bhi kehete hai, me IC takneekon ko ucch shakti par lagaaya jaataa he
 The components of semiconductor devices are identified differently by different manufacturers
 phir bhi kai koshishon ke baad kuch maanakon kaa prachlan dekhne main aa rahaa he, jaise kii america main JEDEC JESD370B, europe main pro electron or japan main JIS
 Semiconductors are already in use since the discovery of transistors in the field of electronics
 beesvin sadi ke shruwaat ke samay ke radio main inhen "billi kii much" naamak sansuchak avyav ke rup main dekha gaya
 The conduction of these early detectors had many disadvantages - the fibers made of tungsten had to be moved around the galena or carbondum crystals until it suddenly started to work! At that time, their operating system was not known

 In 1939, he tried on even more purified crystals and found that although his ruminative attitude was over, its ability to detect also disappeared
 phir ek din achaanak unke paas padey ek ucchtam shuddhta ke crystal ne kaam karnaa shuru kar diya - dhyaan se dekhne par pataa chalaa ke is crystal ke bichon bich ek choti si daraar thi
 Then he noticed that by changing the place in the room of the detector, if he starts doing this work then he should stop
 unhone pataa lagaaya ke crystal kaa yah bartaav us par pads rahe roshni par nirbhar karata he
 When he showed it to others, Walter Brattan quickly realized that some sort of joint was forming on the crack of the crystal
 bhed khulne main der nahi lagi
 The reason for the cracks in the crystals was the imbalance in corruption between the two sides of the crack, due to which some electrons were more on one side and less on the other side
 chunki dono bhaag jude hue the, electron ke adhikshmata ke taraf se duusari taraf kaa pravaah tab shuru hua jab bydaree ko lagane se bydaree ke vidyut sanchaalan shakti se adhiksham electron duusari taraf kud padey or trutipurna "chhidron" me ja baithe
 But this created an instability! The maximum side lacks an electron for smooth balance, which the battery fulfills by giving up its electron, and by absorbing additional electrons on the other side, the battery completes the entire cycle
 is tarah bijli kaa dhar pravaah sthapit ho gaya
 Changing the direction of the battery halts this flow because the "electrons" fill the electrons in the "holes", and the maximum electrons on the other side cause the electrons to not move
 do thos crystalon ke bane is diod ke is aacharan ko ardhachalan kehete hai
 The tendency of the diode to close is due to the separation of the charge carriers near the joint and the region
 It is called the depreciation zone
 ardhchalkon ke is naye gyaan ko sahejane ke liye paradu vishwavidhyalay, bel labs, em aai tii or ne milakar naye behatar crystal banaaye or takneekon ko samaapit kiya
 Within a year, germanium production has come to such a maturity that their use started in strategic radars
 yudh ke bad, wiliam shokli ne tryod jaise ardhchaalak yukti ko banane kaa prayaas kiya
 For this he obtained funding and a lab, started working with John Bardeen and Brittain
 transister ke vikaas ke liye ardhchalkon me electronon ke sachlan ko samajhnaa mahatvapurn tha
 If this movement between the emitter and the collector of the diode can be controlled somehow, then the amplifier can be developed
 yadi ek tarah ke kristal ke donon taraf vidyut prachlan shakti ko lagaayen, to electronon kaa pravaah sthapit nahi hota; agar electron yaa "chhidron" ko tisare antak se antaravahit karen to yah pravaah sthpit ho saktaa he
 The utility of large crystals as an amplifier is also low, as it has to interfere with a large amount of electrons or holes
 kul milakar, transister ke banane main kristal ke avakshay kshetra dwaara choti duriyon main electronon kaa prabandh or nivesh or nirgam ke sampark ko sataha se nikatataa par nirbhar karti he
 When Brittain started making such a device, the amplification would be seen to disappear and disappear

 The electrons of the crystal are characterized by the influence of nearby charges - electrons near the emitter's surface and holes are collected near the surface of the cascade, looking for opposite charges
 inhe bady aasaani se is sataha se hataaya ja saktaa he kristal ke kisi bhi sahi kone main thode se aaveshon ke antaravahan se
 If the emitter and the collector are close together, the flow of electrons between them leads to the flow of charges
 jahaan aaveshon kaa yah antaravahan kisi halake se sanket kaa nirupan karata he, utsarjak or samahrta ke bich kaa dhar pravaah is sanket kaa pravarddhit utpaada hota he
 After several attempts at Bell Labs, the success was finally found in the form of a nozzle-coincident transistor

 Current flow occurred when the electrical electrons on the ground of the crystal flowed towards the electron floor

 In 1957, William Shokley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain received the Nobel Prize in Physics

 Shokley was unhappy that he had to share the credit for the invention of the transistor with Bardeen and Brattan
 bail labs ke vakeelon ko jab pataa chalaa ke shokli ke lekhon me kuch samaantaayen thim julius adgar lilian ke 1925 ke patent se, to unhone shokli ke naam ko transister ke patent se baahar rakhane kaa vichaar kiya
 Shokli was extremely annoyed by this and decided to show who the real mind was

 Gandhi's government had to face major difficulties following his tremendous mandate of 1971
 congress party kii aantarik sanrachana iske asankhya vibhaajan ke falswaroop kamjor padane se chunaav main bhagya nirdhaaran ke liye puri tarah se unke netritv par nirbharsheel ho gai thi

 yah naaraa or prastaavit garibi hataao kaarykram kaa khaakaa, jo iske saath aayaa, gandhi ko gramin or shahari garibon par aadhaarit ek swatantra rashtriya samarthan dene ke liye taiyaar kiye gaye the
 In this way, they were allowed to ignore the state and local governments and the urban business class, which were dominated by the dominant rural castes
 or, ateet main bejubaan rahe garib ke hisse, kam se kam rajnatik mulya evam rajnatik bhaar, donon kii prapti main vruddhi hui

 Thus, although the program failed to reduce poverty, it achieved the goal of winning Gandhi the election

 Treating his strong parliamentary majority, his ruling Indian National Congress had amended the constitution to change the balance of power between the Center and the states

 Furthermore, the growing influence of Sanjay Gandhi, who had become Gandhi's closest political advisor in place of elected officials, expressed displeasure at PN Haksar, Gandhi's former advisor when he rose to the height of his capacity
