 avah shabd kaa arth apbhransh se bhinn nahin he
 Adahmana has used four languages - Avahath, Sanskrit, Prakrit and Paishachi
 jyotirishwar thakur ne chah bhashaa or saat upbhaashaon kii suchi main "avahtt' kaa bhi pariganan kiya he
 Vidyapati has used this word as a popular language
 chaahe avah shabd main swayan koi aisa sanket na ho, jiske aadhaar par ham ise shauraseni kaa parvarti rup maane, phir bhi itnaa to kaha ja saktaa he ki yah apbhransh ke vikaas kii parvarti bhashaa kaa vaachak shabd he or yah bhi spasht he ki yah saarvajaneen rup tha
 The commentator of Prakrit Pangalam calls it the "adya Bhasha"
 yah usee style kaa kathan he, jisamen praakrit ko kabhi aadi bhashaa kaha gaya tha
 Vidyapati put it at par with the native language or the people language
 kuch kavi ise "deshi' hi kehete hai

 vastu or style donon hi deshyatattvon se abhimandit hone lageen
 From the point of view of the region, this style appears to be extremely comprehensive
 abdulrahman multan ke the
 This was not the prevalent language of the region, but the poetic style used here was defiant
 sandeshraasak kii style rudh or kritrim saahitiyik style he
 But the language of the couplets seems very new and extremely oriented towards the lingua franca
 dow harivallabh bhayaani ne dohon kii bhashaa hemchandra ke dwaara ullikhit dohon ke samaan yaa usase bhi adhik agrasaribhoot bhashaa- sthiti se sambhddha maani he
 It seems that the poet wants to adopt the structure of the defined style
 jisamen sanskrit or praakrit ke upkaran sangrathit hai
 At the same time he periodically pursues such couplets, which were prevalent in the folk style
 in prachlit dohon kii style kaa yah vaishishty sadaiv se prakat hota aa rahaa tha
 The style of the couplets may also vary according to the nature of the story
 prem or virah kii komal anubhutiyon ko vyakt karne ke liye lokgeeton kii style kaa prayog hota rahaa he
 In "sandeshrasak", couplets have also been used only at emotion-stricken sites
 in dohon kii style bahut kuch brajabhasha par aadhaarit he
 The Avah style was also popular in the East Zone
 is style main praapt purvi anchal kii kritiyon main vidyapati kii "kirtilata', sfoot prashastiyaan, sidhon ke gaan or dohe aate hai
 Vidyapati has accepted "avhatta"
 is avah main kuch purvi rupon kaa samanvay swaabhaavik he
 But the nature and structure of the language of Kirtilata is of disobedience
 vidyapati avah bhashaa style kaa sachetan prayog rajastuti ke sandarbhon main karte hai
 This is the reason for the expansion of the field of influence of a conservative and defined style
 prem- prasangon or geeti- vidya main vidyapati lokbhasha kaa prayog karata he
 This repetition of language is also found in Abdul Rahman to a certain extent
 bhashaa kaa duharaapan siddh- sahitya main bhi uplabdh hota he
 There is a relatively pure use of Western abrasions in the couplets composed by the Siddhas
 geet- rachana ke vaiyaktik kshanon main siddh- kavi purvi bhashaaon ke sthaneey rupon kii ore jhuk jaataa he, chaahe style kii mul sanrachana parvarti apbhransh yaa avah kii hi ho
 The basis of Brajbuli is also disregarded
 is prakaar avah gujarat se bengal, assam, urisa tak sthaneey prabhaavon se samanvit miltaa he
 The Avah style is used on the one hand in Vidyapati's state-based, commendable compositions, on the other hand, the Doha dictionary of Siddhas also has the shadow of disobedience
 peeche vaishnav andolan ke upasthit hone par vahi "brajabuli' style main sankramit ho jaati he
 In the event of this infection, the forms of western aphasia begin to diminish and the local forms of Maithili and Bangla begin to emerge
 brajabhasha ke rup to bahut pehle ubhar chuke the, par uski style ke rup main pratishtha kuch peeche hui
 The forms of Brajbhasha can be targeted in apabhramsa, but apabhramsa was prevalent in style
 vaiyakarnon, sahitya shasriyon or sookhtikaron ke dwaara sankalit padya sambhawatah lok prachlit rahe honge
 Their language is about to introduce some further developmental status, being related to mass flow, rather than the defined abrasion

 Rustic Apabhramsa was more rural than Shishta or "nagar" Apabhramsa
 praakrit jab parinishthit style main dhal gai, tab apbhransh ke deshgat bhedon kii ore sanket kiya gaya
 Shaurseni or Western Apabhramsa was defined as a widespread style, when the country variety of rural or story forms of Apabhramsa started to get attention? What Hemachandra called gramya-apabhransh was named "ukti" by Damodar Pandit of Kashi
 vaiyaakaran kii drushti main parinishthit or graamy- bhed shuddh bhashaa vaigyanik drushti se the, kintu auktik apbhransh ek lokastyle prathit hoti he, jiskaa saadrishy nagar style se tha
 The classical style, even if it informs the emergence of folklore, is the use of folk forms popular in the elegant style, but that is - a style used in literature
 lok prachlit dohon kaa prayog or sangrah, donon hi sambhaavnaaon ko pusht karata he
 In the eyes of the pundits, the illiterate would be knocking out the physical form! The folklore utterances of the Palmerzans must have given them daze too! But, practical trends will encourage them! Personal specialty will be proved by them
 Naturally this folk style will also have many country differences
 jahaan parinishthit apbhransh kii style apni parampara banaakar rajshray khoj rahi thi, vahaan auktik style kii parampara bhi ban rahi thi, chaahe vah ksheen hi ho
 In chronology, the first style relaxed and the second stored power

 ukti vyakti prakaran kii rachana to purvi anchal main hui, par anya auktik rachanaayen rajasthan- gujarat kshetra main hui
 It is natural for Western Hindi or Brazi to be in this style
 ukti shabd, pingal style kii tulana main, saamanyajan kii boli yaa lokokti kaa vaachan he
 Its coexistence with defined styles like Pingle should be considered
 yah koi bhashaa- boli nahin, ek lok style hi thi, uskaa kshetra rajasthan- gujarat se kosal tak to praapt rachanaaon ke aadhaar par nishchit hota he anya kshetron main bhi lok style kii rachanaayen hui hongi
 This style does not have artificiality like royalty style or high literary style
 auktik style kaa vaishnavikaran nahin hua
 Its original culmination was in proverb or ethics
 vaishnav yug main jo lokbhasha, style or sahitya kii pratishtha hui, usamen keval auktik kii mul prakruti ko khoja ja saktaa he
 In folk, where adornments were practiced as a couplet and used in works like "sandesh-rasak", like poetry or verse were also prevalent in the form of proverbial proverbs, whose inspiration resulted in future ethics

Imam Alaihi Assalam pledged in response to this: namaaz ke bahut se falsafe hai unhen main se ek ye bhi he ki pehle log azaad the or khuda-o-rasul kii yaad se gaafil the or un ke darmayaan sirf koran tha ummat muslima bhi guzashata ummaton kii tarah thi kyonki unhon ne sirf deen ko ikatiyaar kar rakhaa tha or kitaab or anabaya-e-ko chhod rakhaa tha or un ko qatal tak kar dete the

 Apart from the five times of daily prayers, there are some other prayers which are grouped
 pehali namaaz jumas kii he, jo surya ke dhalane ke ananthar namaaz juhr ke sthaan par padhi jaati he
 In this, the Imam gives a speech before offering Namaz, which is called Khutba
 isamen allaah kii prashansa ke sivaa musalamaanon ko neki kaa upadesh diya jaataa he
 The second namaz is recited on the day of Eidulfitra
 yah musalamaanon kaa vah tyohaar he, jise urdu main id kehete hai or ramajaan ke puure maheene roje rakhane ke ananthar jis din nayaa chandramaa nikalataa he uske duusare din maanate hai

 On these days, the timings of the fixed namaz lasts till about twelve o'clock in the sunrise

 The variation remains only that in these the first rakat has to be raised three times and again in the second rakat three times more hands
 namaaz ke ananthar imam khutaba detaa he, jisamen neki va bhalaai karne ke upadesh rahete hai

 bhashadarshan kaa sambandh in chaar kendriya samasyaon se he- arth kii prakruti, bhashaa prayog, bhashaa sangyaan, tathaa bhashaa or vaastaviktaa ke bich sambandh
 But some philosophers do not consider linguistics as a separate subject, considering it to be a part of logic
 bharat main bhashaa ke tatvamimasiy va gyanamimasiy pakshon par sudur pracheen kaal se hi vichaar armbh ho gaya tha
 Many technical terms had to be sheltered for the creation of grammar
 naam, aakhyaat upsarg, nipaat, kriya, ling, vachan, vibhakti, pratyay ityadi shabdon ke madhyam se bhashaa ke vibhinn roopon kaa vishleshan kiya gaya
 Deep thinking, subtle thinking and the method of discovering truth is called philosophy
 is kaaran bhashaa ke vishleshan ko bhi darshanashastra kaa str mil gaya
 In Vedic literature itself, this level began to be found
 gopath brahman kaa rishi prashn karte hue kahata he- These questions address the internal epistemology of the language
 yadi in prashnon kaa uttar de diya jaae, to puraa vyakarandarshan saamne aa jaataa he
 When there was curiosity about the metal, the tradition, the name, the famous, etc
, they were also resolved and the long tradition of the Acharyas who did the solution was also established
 niruktkaar yask ne naam, aakhyaat aadi ke vivaran prastut karte hue katipay purvaacharyon ke maton kaa ullekh kiya he
 It is clear from this that the philosophical process of grammar in this country had reached a high stage of development several hundred years before Christ
 upsarg tathaa naam shabdon ke swaroop ke sambandh main apane se purvavarti acharya gargy tathaa shakatayan ke paraspar virdohi maton kaa ullekh yask ne apane nirukt main bhi kiya he
 In this Nirukta, 2 major and basic principles of Akhandacharya's grammatical philosophy of one Acharya Oudumbarayana have been mentioned by Bhartrihari in the phrase, and Bharatamishra in Sphotasiddha
 yudhshthir mimasak audumbrayan acharya kaa samay 3100 varsh vikrampurv athwa usase kuch purv maanate hai
 The principle of syllogism called Sphotravada is believed to be related to the predecessor of Panini to Acharya Sphotayan
 sphotayan acharya kaa ullekh panini ne ‘avagh sphotynasy’ sutara par kiya he
 Haradatta has interpreted the word sphotayan as follows- yudhisthir mimasak spaphotayan acharya kaa samay 3200 vikram purv maanate hai
 But just as very little material of pre-panini grammatology is available today, similarly the philosophical ideas related to the grammar of the foregoing have also been less safe
 jaise shabdanishpattivyavastaanarup sanskritvyakaran kaa suvyavasthit rup panini se armbh hota he vaise hi vyakarandarshan kaa bhi spasht rup panini se hi armbh hota he
 Although Panini had written Ashtadhyayi for the sake of word-of-mind, but due to his grammatical structure, he had to compose many definitions-formulas
 anek sangyashbd banane pade or paribhaashik shabdon ke lakshan dene pade
 We see that in this inversion of Acharya, a detailed background of grammatical philosophy was created on its own
 panini dwaara prayukt vibhaasha, padvidhi, aadesh, vipratishedh, upmaan, ling, kriyatipatti, kalvibhag, vipsa, pratyaylakshan, bhavalakshan, shabdarthprakruti jaise saikadon shabd is baat ke pratik hai ki ve un dinon ke darshanik vaadon se purnroop se avgat the or swayan ucchkoti ke darshanik chintak the
 Many of his sutras are a philosophy in themselves
 udhaaharan ke rup main ham nimna sutron par drushtipaat kar sakate hai- The truth is that Panini is a certified teacher for later philosophers
 baad ke vaiyakarnon ne vyakaran se sambaddh jo kuch vichaar vyakt kiye hai unka anumodan ve kisi na kisi tarah panini ke sutron se karte hai
 All the opinions related to grammatical philosophy are confirmed by Panini's beliefs
 kisi pracheen acharya kii ukti he, jo kuch vritti-granthon main he or jo kuch vaartikon main he, vah sab sutron main hi he

 Attempts are made to clarify, describe and give suggestions regarding the state and political institutions
 nihsandeh, naitik darshanik prayojan kaa adhyayan to usamen antarnihit rahata hi he
 Thinker Weinstein said while filling the ocean in Gagar that political theory is primarily an operation in which questions are asked, answers to those questions are developed and imaginary perspectives are created regarding the public life of human beings
 jo prashn puche jate hai ve kuch is tarah ke hote hai rajya kaa swaroop or prayojan kya he? raajnneetik sanghathan ke saadhyon, lakshyon or paddatiyon ke bare main ham kaise nirnay karen? rajya or vyakti ke bich sambandh kya he or kya hona chahie? itihaas ke puure daur main raajnneetik siddhanth in prashnon ke uttar detaa rahaa he
 It has been considered important because the fate of man depends on what kind of system the rulers and the rulers get and whether the joint action is taken for the common good as a result of that system
 darshan main satya or gyaan kii khoj main kisi bhi vishay par kiye gaye samast chintan kaa samavesh he
 When that search is on political subjects, then we call it political philosophy
 isliye jaruri nahin ki usamen koi siddhanth prastaavit kiya jaae or raajnneetik darshan tathaa raajnneetik siddhanth main yahi antar he
 Thus, political theory is a part of political philosophy, but political philosophy is mostly much broader and does not necessarily include any theory
 is prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki raajnneetik darshan rajya, sarkaar, raajnneeti, swatantraaa, nyaay, sampatti, adhikaron, kanoon or kisi bhi praadhikaran dwaara kanoonee samhita ko lagu karaane aadi se sambandhit prashnon arthath ve kya hai? unki jarurat agar he to kyon he? koun-si baaten kisi sarkaar ko vaid banaati hai, use kin adhikaron or kin swatantraaaon kii raksha kerani chahie or use kyon or koun-sa rup grahan karnaa chahie or kanoon kyon he or kya he or vaid sarkaar ke prati nagarikon ke kartavya yadi hai to kya hai or kab kisi sarkaar ko apdasth kar dena vaid hoga yaa nahin hoga aadi prashnon kaa adhyayan he
 By 'political philosophy' we often refer to a general attitude towards politics or to a specific morality or belief or attitude in relation to it, and not all of it necessarily comes under the entire technical subject of philosophy
 raajnneetik darshan kaa sarokaar aksar samakaleen prashnon se nahin, balki manushya ke raajnneetik jivan ke adhik saarvbhaum prashnon se hota he
 But the political theorist's vision is mainly on contemporary political life and although he is interested in explaining the nature and purpose of the state and similar general questions, he is however interested in political behavior, the actual relationship between the state and the citizens and society
 It is also trying to describe and understand the realities of the role of power
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan karte hue hamen yah mahasoos hota he ki raajnneetik siddhanth kii anupurti hamen raajnneetik darshan ke adhyayan se kerani chahie anyathaa vah banjar or apraasangik prathit hote hai
 Political theories are sometimes seen as synonymous with political thought, but it is important to understand that they do not necessarily mean the same
 raajnneetik chintan ek samanyikrut muhaavara he, jisamen rajya tathaa rajya se sambandhit prashnon par kisi vyakti yaa vyaktiyon ke samooh yaa samudaay ke sabhi chintanon, siddhanton or mulyon kaa samavesh hota he
 When a person - whether he is a professor, journalist, writer, poet, novelist etc
 or of course he is a politician - expresses ideas that have a concern in our lives and the thoughts which are about the state and governance and the questions related to them, then he is really Is contemplating political
 uske vichaaron main siddhanth kaa samavesh ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 There will be no theory contained in those ideas when there is no systematic and rational hypothesis presented to explain the historical and political composition related to political rule of state and governance etc
 is prakaar raajnneetik chintan hameshaa kisi vyakti yaa samooh kaa raajnneeti-vishyak saamaanya vichaar hota he, jabaki raajnneetik siddhanth apane-aap main purna or apane bal-boote khadi aisi vyakhya yaa vichaar athwa siddhanth hota he jisamen prashnon ke uttar dene, itihaas kii vyakhya karne or bhavishya kii sambhavit ghatnaon ke bare main purvanumaan lagane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 Of course, this theory is always the creation of a single thinker
 barker ne kaha tha ki raajnneetik chintan kisi puure yug kaa antarvarti darshan hota he, lekin raajnneetik siddhanth kisi ek vyakti kaa chintan hota he
 Political science is a broad subject or field of study and political theory is a sub-field of it
 raajnneeti vigyaan main ye tamaam baaten shaamil hai: raajnneetik chintan, raajnneetik siddhanth, raajnneetik darshan, raajnneetik vichaardhaara, sansthagat yaa sanrachanagat dhaancha, tulanaatmak raajnneeti, lok prashasan, antarrashtriya kanoon or sanghathan aadi
 Some thinkers have emphasized the science side of political science
 unka kahana he ki jab raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan ek vigyaan ke rup main vaigyanik paddatiyon se kiya jaataa he tab raajnneetik siddhanth jis had tak raajnneetik darshan kaa hissaa he us had tak vah raajnneeti vigyaan nahin mana ja saktaa, kyonki raajnneeti vigyaan main to amurtt or antahprerana se udbhoot nishkarshon yaa chintanon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he lekin raajnneetik darshan thik inhen ayatharth paddatiyon par bharosa karke chalata he
 Political theory is neither pure thought nor pure philosophy nor pure science
 raajnneetik siddhanth main jin prashnon kaa mahatva rahaa he ve samay ke saath-saath badalte rahe hai
 Classical and early political theories were concerned with the quest for a morally flawless political system and focused on questions about the nature and purpose of the state, the basis for the use of political power, and the problem of political defiance
 aadhunik raashtra rajyon ke udai or aarthik sanrachana main hue parivartanon tathaa audyogic kranti ke falswaroop nai praathamikataayen saamne ain or dhyaan kaa centre vyaktvaad tathaa vyakti kii swatantraaa or samaaj evam rajya ke saath uskaa sambandh ban gaya
 Questions like rights, duties, liberty, equality and property became more important
 dhire-dhire ek avadharana ke saath dusro ke sambandh kii vyakhya jaise swatantraaa or samanta, nyaay or swatantraaa, yaa samanta or sampatti ke bich ke sambandh kii vyakhya : bhi mahatvapurn ho gai
 After World War II, a new type of empirical political theory emerged
 isamen manushya ke raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karne or uske aadhaar par saidhantik nishkarsh nikaalane kii koshish kii gai
 Scholars studying human behavior posed new questions for study
 ve bahudhaa vidha kii anya shakhaon se aise prashn udhaar lete the
 Some of these questions are as follows: vigat kuch dashakon se kai or bhi masale ubhare hai - jaise pahchaan, ling, paryaavarnavaad, paristhitiki, samudaay aadi
 At the same time, the value-based political theory has also been revived, in which the questions of freedom, equality and justice have been emphasized in a new way
 ham maanav gana saamaajik praaniyon ke rup main saath-saath samaaj main rahete hai, jisamen ham sansadhano, rojgaron or puraskaron main saajhedaari karte hai
 At the same time, we are also individuals, in which condition we need some basic human rights
 isliye mail-jol tathaa khushhaali ko adhiktam seemaa tak le jane ke khatir or vyaktigat aatm-siddhi ke liye anukool paristhitiyaan sulabh karaane ke nimitt rajya tathaa samaaj ke sanghathan kii prakriya mahatvapurn ho jaati he
 As a result, political theory becomes important for paving the way for the unity and integrity of human societies or the collective needs of society, as it tries to study problems and find solutions in that process
 raajnneetik siddhanth kii praasangikta rajya ke swaroop or prayojan ke prati, raajnneetik satta ke aadhaar or sarkaar ke sabase shreyaskar rup ke sambandh main or rajya tathaa vyakti ke buniyadi adhikaron ke sandarbh main un donon ke bich ke sambandhon ke bare main vibhinn drushtikonon kaa vikaas karne main nihit hoti he
 In addition, political theory also tries to establish moral standards and suggest alternative political management and behavior to test the moral quality of the political state
 sankshep main kahen to raajnneetik siddhanth kii praasangikta nimnlikhit baton main nihit haih It should also be remembered that at least in the present period the state is facing greater challenges of poverty, corruption, mass democracy and ethnic and racial tensions, environmental pollution etc
 inke alaava antarrashtriya vibhedon aadi kii samasya to he hi
 Political theory tries to study the present and future problems of the political life of society and suggest solutions to those problems
 david heldne kaha he ki raajnneetik siddhanth kaa kaary apni jatiltaaon ke kaaran bahut guru-gambhir he, kyonki vyavasthit adhyayan ke abhaav main is baat kaa khatra rahata he ki raajnneeti agyaan or swaarthee logon ke haathon main apni shakti kii bhukh mitaane kaa saadhan banakar na rah jaae
 Thus, if we have to systematically consider the nature and purpose of the state and the problems of governance, keeping in mind the social reality and ideals and political philosophy, then we have to adopt the path of theoretical study of the problem
 is prakaar raajnneetik siddhanth praasangik he
 At the same time, studying political theory on a personal level gives us information about our rights and duties and helps in understanding social realities and problems like poverty, violence, corruption etc
 raajnneetik siddhanth isliye bhi mahatvapurn hai ki vibhinn raajnneetik siddhanton ko aadhaar bana kar ‘aage badhate hue vah hamen samaaj ko badalane ke upaay or dishaaen suza saktaa he, taaki adarsh samaaj sthapit kiya ja sake
 The Marxist theory is an example of a theory that not only suggests direction but goes to the extent of advocating revolution to establish an egalitarian society
 yadi koi raajnneetik siddhanth sahi he to vah aam logon tak sampreshit kiya ja saktaa he or tab vah samaaj tathaa maanav jati ko pragati ke path par le jane vaali prabal shakti ban saktaa he

 This rule was formulated in 1879 on the basis of experimental tests made by Joseph Steffon by John Tyndall and Ludwig Boltzmann made a theoretical analysis in 1884 using thermodynamics
 steffon ne apane niyam kii sahaayta se surya kaa prishthiya taap gyaat kiya
 He found from the data of Charles Soret that the density of energy from the sun is 29 times greater than the plate heated to a certain temperature
 ek gol patalika prekshan yantra se kuch duuri par is tarah se rakhaa gaya ki yah surya ke samaan kone par dikhaai de
 Soret estimated the temperature of the plate at around 1900 ° c to 2000 ° C

 The same formula can also be used to find the radius of the main sequence star relative to the Sun: jahaan r ⊙ { \ displaystyle R_{ \ odot }}, saura trigya he
 With the help of the Steffon Volzmann law, astronomers easily estimate the radius of the star

 Poor design leads to intermittent problems such as glitches, vanishing fast pulses that may trigger some logic but not others, "runt pulses" not reaching valid threshold voltages or a combination of unexpected logic states
 jab se digital circuit analog ghatakon se bana hai digital circuit lo-prisishan se bhi dhire gananaa karata he jo ek samaan spes or shakti kaa prayog karata he
 However the digital circuit will be able to assess repeatedly due to its high noise immunity
 On the other hand, analog circuits in high precision domains need more power and digital equivalent area

 In this way engineers can design the aggregate behavior of a system and even test it in continuous simulation without considering the details of the logic processes without considering all the details of the logic functions
 anukramik system iske atirikt do upashreniyon main vibhajit hota he
 When a "clock" signal changes the state, the "synchronous" sequential system changes the state at once
 jab bhi input badalte hai "atulykaalik" anukramik pranali parivartan ko prasaarit karata he
 Synchronous sequential systems are characterized by asynchronous circuits such as flip flops, which make these changes only when the clock changes and in which the timing margin is carefully designed
 hameshaa kii tarah ek tulykaalik anukramik state mashin ko ek sangyojan logic main vibhajit karke lagu karne kaa vyaavhaarik tarika hota he or flip flop ke set ko "state register" kaha jaataa he
 Each time a clock gives a ticking signal and the state register captures the response generated from the previous state of the combinational logic and re-inserts it as the invariant input to the combinational part of the state machine
 sangyojan logic main samay ke khapat vaale adhikansh logic akalan dwaara ghadi kii sabase tej dar set hoti he
 The state register represents just one binary number
 agar state mashin main state bahut zyada hai to logic prakriya kuch sangyojan logic hote hai jo kai sankhya main state kaa utpaadan karti hai
 In comparison, the design of asynchronous systems is very difficult because the possible state must be considered at all possible times
 nunatam or adhiktam samay ke teble ke nirmaan ke sabase saamaanya vidhi ke anusaar isamen saare state vidyaman ho or vaise state ke minimise ke liye circuit ko samyojit kiya jaataa he or jo iske sabhi hisson ke susangat state main samay-samay par jane ke liye circuit ko baadhya kare
 aise saavdhaan dizin ke bina sanyogvash atulykaalik logic kaa utpaadan karnaa aasaan he jo "asthir" he or vaastavik electronics he jisamen apratyaashit parinaam hote hai kyonki electronic upkarnon ke mulyon main chote badlaavon kii vajah se sanchit vilamb hota he
 Some circuits are inherently asynchronous in their design and should be analyzed as such
 2005 ke rup main lagbhag sabhi digital mashine tulykaalik dizin hote hai kyonki tulykaalik dizin ko bananaa or satyapit karnaa bahut aasaan he-vartmaan main digital mashiinon kii nakal karne vaale softver, atulykaalik dizin ko nahin sambhalate

 Constructing an asynchronous circuit using fast parts indirectly "runs" the circuit faster
 aam taur par, kai digital system, data pravaah mashine hai
 Often they are designed using synchronous register transfer logic and have been used as VHDL or Verilog hardware description languages
 register hastantaran logic main dwiadhari sankhya flip flop ke samoohon main sangrahit hai jise register kaha jaataa tha
 The output of each register is a bundle of wires called a "bus" that passes that number for other estimation
 yah akalan keval sangyojan logic kaa ek bhaag he
 Each estimation has a bus output and can be connected to multiple input registers
 kabhi-kabhi ek register ke paas inke input par bahusanketak hota he jisase yah kai bason main se kisi ek se nambar ko store kar saktaa he
 Alternatively the output of several things can be connected via buffers which can turn off the output of all devices except one
 input se prayek register ke naye data ko sweekaar karne par anukramik state mashin niyantran karata he
 In the 1980s some researchers found that almost all synchronous register-transfer machines could be converted to asynchronous designs using first-in-first-out synchronization logic
 is yojana main digital mashin, ek data pravaah ke ek set ke rup main pahachaani jaati he
 At each step of the flow, an asynchronous "synchronization circuit" determines when the output of that step is solid and gives a presented signal to "hold the data" to the stages in which the inputs to those stages are used

 The bits from the microprogram control the arithmetic logic unit, memory and other parts of the computer, and the microservices itself
 is tarah computer ke niyantran kii digining ke jatil kaary ko apekshaakrit kaaphi saral logic mashiinon ke sangrah ke saral kaaryon main parivartit kar diya gaya
 Computer architecture is a specialized engineering activity that tries to classify registers, assessment logic, buses, and other parts of a computer in some way for the best purpose
 computer vaastukar ne laagat kam karne or gati ko teevr karne or computer programing trutiyon kii pratiraksha ke liye computer ke dizin main vrihad maatra main suprayog ko lagaaya he
 And its simple purpose is to reduce power in a fast battery powered computer system

 ek baar input data ko sahi maanane ke baad, khud dizine ko abhi bhi shuddhta ke liye satyapit kiya janaa chahie
 Some instrument flows confirm the design first by producing a design and then scanning the design to produce input data relevant to the instrument flow
 yadi scan kiya hua data, input data ke saath mail khaataa he, to upkaran pravaah ne shaayad koi trutiyaan pesh nahin kii
 Functional validation data, usually called "test vectors"

 sikadanr ne jab aisa hi kiya par brahman ne apana mat badalane se inkaar kar diya or tab use maar diya gaya

 " The exchange rate is the relative price of two different currencies, that is, a measure of the value of another currency in terms of one currency
 kinhin do mudraon ke madhya vinimay kii dar unki parsparik maang or aapurti ke aadhaar par nirdhaarit hoti he
 Before considering foreign exchange it is necessary to know the meaning of the word 'exchange'
 vinimay kaa saadhaaran arth yah he ki kisi ek vastu ke badale aavashyaktaa kii anya vastuen praapt karnaa
 The sale or exchange of goods is also called exchange
 videshi vinimay main bhinn deshon kii leni deni kaa parsparik vinimay hota he
 It includes the consideration of exchange rate in addition to the consideration of the rate of exchange by which one country becomes the debtor and creditor of other countries
 videshi vinimay main is baat kaa bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he ki us leni deni kaa kis prakaar bhugtan kiya jaataa he or uski vishmata kaa vinimay kii dar par kya prabhaav padataa he
 We have to consider why a country becomes a debtor and a creditor of another country
 jitani rakam kii vastuen baahar se kisi desh main aati hai utani rakam kaa vah desh anya deshon kaa dendar ho jaataa he or jitani rakam kii vastuen vah baahar anya deshon ko bhejtaa he utani rakam kaa vah lender ho jaataa he
 Importation of goods on foreign ships also makes them payable to other countries for the hire of ships
 isi prakaar apane jahaaj par maal baahar bhejne ke kaaran vah anya deshon kaa lender bhi ho jaataa he
 If the government or a person of the country buys debentures and shares etc
, then the country becomes a creditor of other countries
 iske atirikt videshiyon se karj lene ke samay bhi anya deshon kaa dendar ho jaataa he
 Due to the savings and profits of foreigners working in the country, the country also becomes the debtor of other countries
 jab desh kisi kaaran se anya deshon ko vishesh 'kar' dene ke liye baadhya kiya jaataa he to vah is rakam ke liye anya desh kaa dendar ho jaataa he
 In order to pay the above mentioned transactions, gold and silver coins are prevalent in some countries and their transactions are used in these coins
 yadi kisi kaaran se desh ko apana karj chukaane kaa koi anya saadhan nahin miltaa, to use sona yaa chaandi bhejne ke liye baadhya hona padataa he
 Merchants often pay from foreign bills only because now the government has prohibited the sending of gold and silver
 hundi ek prakaar kaa aagyaptr he
 The author of a bill authorizes a person or organization to give the amount written in a bill to the nominee
 aisi hundi ko 'vyapaaree hundi' kehete hai
 In addition to the merchant bill, another type of bill is used which is called 'rojgari bill'
 iske atirikt yatri hundi, sarkari hundi or bainkon dwaara jari kii gai hundiyon kaa upyog bhi videshi vyapaarik len dein chukaane main hota he
 The rate at which the above transaction is repaid is called the exchange rate
 is dar par praaia: bainkon dwaara videshi darshanee hundiyaan sweekaari jaati hai or isi dar par kisi samay desh kii leni deni kii vishmata kaa prabhaav padataa he
 If there is no restriction in sending the gold out of the government and the rate of exchange is much higher than the taking of the country, then the rate of exchange reaches the limit when the citizens have the facility to send the gold in exchange for the bill
 is seemaa ko swarna-niryaat-dar kehete hai or vinimay kii dar iske baahar nahin jaati
 On the contrary, it is much more than taking any country from other countries, then the exchange rate of that country reaches that limit when other countries have the facility to send gold instead of sending the bills to that country
 is dar ko swarnayaat-dar kehete hai
 The rate of foreign exchange does not exceed this limit
 is prakaar swarna aayaat or niryaat dar ke andar hi kisi desh kii vinimay kii dar ghatati badhati he
 Now we have to know what effect of excessive variation in the rate of exchange has on business or human beings of different classes
 jab vinimay kii dar swarna-aayaat-dar se baahar jane lagati he to desh main baahar se maal mangaanevaalon ko laabh hota he or aayaat ko uttejnaa milti he
 At the same time, those who send goods out of the country have to suffer loss
 desh ke andar kii vastuon kii keemat kuch ghatane lagati he
 There is a loss to those industries which compete with foreign cheap goods inside the country
 is prakaar vinimay kii dar kii atyadhik ghatbad se kisi ko to laabh hota he or kisi ko haani
 Traders lose thousands and some gain as much
 is haani laabh se bachane ke liye prayek desh kii sarkaar kaa yah praytn ho jaataa he ki vah vinimay kii dar ko atyadhik ghatane badhane se roke
 At present, authentic coins of gold and silver are not prevalent in most countries of the world
 patramudra kaa sarvatra hi prachaar he
 The import and export of gold has been banned by governments
 is kaaran kisi bhi desh kii sarkaar ko apane desh kii videshi vinimay kii dar kaa niyantran karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 She always tries that at any time it should not be too much than the nation's donation
 videshi vinimay ke niyantran karne kaa pradhan kaaran yah he ki vinimay dar main ghatbad hone ke kaaran antarrashtriya vyapaar ko bahut dhakka lagata he
 Therefore, many countries set up foreign exchange equalization funds to prevent this variation
 us kosh main swadesh kaa dravya or anya deshon kaa dravya or sona bhi rahata he
 In times of economic crisis, sometimes foreign exchange is controlled to prevent the country's capital from going out
 sansar ke pradhan deshon ne milakar antarrashtriya mudra kosh kii sthapana kii he
 The establishment of this fund led to more closer cooperation between countries in financial matters
 is kosh kaa pradhan kaary videshi vinimay main asthirataa kam karne main sadsy deshon kii sahaayta karnaa he
 This fund is also helpful in widening the current trade transactions
 iske atirikt antarrashtriya len dein ko chuktaa karne main bhi yah sahaayak hota he
 The history of Indian foreign exchange is in its own way
 san 1893 main bharat sarkaar ne england ke sikke shilling pence main rupye kii ek kanuunan dar nirdhaarit kii thi vah dar 1 ru
 = 1 shilling 4 pence thi
 The Government of India was able to maintain this rate till 1917
 iske baad vinimay kii dar kaa badhanaa prarambh hua
