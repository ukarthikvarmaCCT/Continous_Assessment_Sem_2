vah baan ghori ke talumul bhed diya
 So Ghori died instantly
 ghori kii hatya se rajaprasaad main kautuhal kii sthiti utpann ho gai
 So Chandbaradiyi mounted Prithviraj on horse and took him to Jalandhar
 vahaan vah prithviraj ne apane yash ke anusaar rajya karke paralok gayi
 The story of Surajnacharitamahakavya bears commonality with Prithviraj Raso Kavya in many parts
 vahaan se bhed he ki, yahan prithviraj chandabaradaayi ke saath gazani pradesh se nikalne main safal ho jate hai
 After that, they rule in Jangl Pradesh and go to the other world
 surjancharitamahakavyakaar prithviraj raso kavy se purnataya asamarthan bhi nahin karte or virodh bhi nahin karte
 Thus in the Surjancharitamahakavya, only the description of Ghori's murder is found
 1361 vikram sanvatsar ke baishakhmas kii poornima tithi par prabandhchintaman kii rachana hui
 The author of this book is Merutung
 prabandhchintamani main ullikhit he ki, mlechhraj ke putr ne apane pita ke apmaan kaa vairoddhar ke liye sapadalaksh samrajya ke shaasha prithviraj par akraman kar diya
 Ghori attacked Prithviraj's kingdom with full vigor
 parantu prithviraj kii sena ke dhanurdharaveeron kii banvarsha se bhaybheet hokar ghori apane sainya ke saath bhaag gaya
 Prithviraj followed Ghori
 maarg main bhojan vibhaag ke kisi adhikari ne prithviraj ko kaha, he rajan! kripaya saatso oot daan main deven
 Hearing his word, Prithviraj replied that, first of all i will kill Mlechraj and subdue his camels, then you will have a wish
 tab raja aage prayaag karne ke liye udyat hue, to someshwar naamak kisi pradhan ne prithviraj ko baar baar mlechhraj ke peeche na jane ke liye kaha
 Enraged by the words of Someshwar, Prithviraj cut off his ear
 prithviraj se parabhoot hua someshwar mlechhraj ke paksh main sakriy ho gaya
 Someshwar plans with Ghori for a long time and trusts him
 vah ghori ko vishwaas detaa rahaa ki, prithviraj ke sammukh uski hi vijay hogi
 Ghori then attacked Prithviraj's army on Ekadashi date
 mlechhraj kii sena ne jab sapadalaksh samrajya ke upar akraman kiya, tab parna ke pashchaat prithviraj ghadhanidra main the
 Ghori's soldiers attacked him and made him a prisoner
 ghori dwaara bandi banaaye gayi prithviraj ne ekamaas tak bandi ke rup main ajmeru-prasaad main nivas kiya
 When Prithviraj was worshiped on Ekadashi date after one month, then Mlechharaj sent him to eat pakwamans
 bhojan ke samay hone par bhi prithviraj poojamagn the, atah unka dhyaan maance par nahin gaya
 But after a long time, a Kukkur entered the Shibir of Prithviraj
 us kukkur ne us maance ko kha liya
 Seeing Kukkur carrying meat, the Pratihari of Shibir asked Prithviraj, why didn't you protect the food? prithviraj ne pratyuttar diya ki, jiske bhojan kaa bhaar saatso oot bhi dhone main asamarth hua karte the, uske bhojan kii aisi sthiti he
 i am watching all this in a friendly way
 tatpashchaat ek pratihaari ne krodh se prithviraj ko puchha, kya abhi bhi itani shakti avshisht he? usko uttar dete hua prithviraj ne kaha, yadi main apane sthaan par pahunch jaaon, to main apana sharirak bal bataaun
 Pratihari's discussion with Prithviraj, Ghori also got news of that discussion
 krodhavisht ho kar vah prithviraj ko ajayameru -prasaad main le gaya
 He ordered Prithviraj to sit on the throne of Prasad
 tatpashchaat singhaasana ke chaaron or sthit chitron ko dekhakar ghori ko peeda hui
 Prithviraj around the throne had installed pictures of pigs beating the mulchos
 phir krodhavesh main ghori ne parashu se rajsinghaas par sthit prithviraj kaa shirishchhedan kar diya
 The description of the deity of Prithviraj is found in this epic poem
 prithviraj ne ajayameru prasaad main hi dehtyag kiya ye varnan miltaa he
 The creation period of Vividhatirthakalpradeep is believed to be AD 1307-1332
 vividhtirthakalpapradip naamar granth prakritbhasha main likhaa gaya he
 The description of that book is found in the twenty-second cycle called Mahayanavirpratimakalpa, arthath, 1248 vikram sanvatsar main jab chouhankul ke divakar shreeprithviraj kii ghori dwaara hatya kii gai, tab ajmeru-prasaad par turkon kaa aadhipaty ho gaya
 Therefore, Mahashresthiramdev, the minister of Ajayameru, issued information that, "before the destruction of the idols of Yavan Jansingh, install all the Jainacharya idols in Valasthan in the land"
 is prakaar is granth main prithviraj ke dehtyag kaa sthaan ajmeru hi varnit hua he
 The doer of Hammiramahkavya was Naychand Suri
 hammirkavy kaa rachanakaal 1460 vikram sanvatsar mana jaataa he
 The description of the last period of Prithviraj is obtained from the 53rd verse to the 72nd verse in the third verse of Hammirkavya
 vahaan ullikhit he ki, Recalling all the wars Ghori had fought with Prithviraj earlier, Ghor looked at Prithviraj and thought, "just as lions are invincible with antelope, so are they invincible to us"
 atah ratrikaal main ghori ne apane vishwaston ko prithviraj kii ashwashaala main bheja
 Who gave unlimited suvarnamudra to the Ashwadhipati and to the Turwadvak as Utkoch
 ratri ke antimprahar main hi yavansainikon ne prithviraj ke sainikon par akraman kar diya
 With several provocative declarations, the civilians attacked the Hindus
 sangram kii sthiti dekhakar bharateshwar prithviraj ashwapaalak dwaara preshit naatyashaala ke ashv par arurh ho gayi
 Seeing Prithviraj ascended at that time, the Turwadvik started playing the songs with the sound of instruments like Panavanak and Gomukh
 sangit sunakar natyashaala kaa ashv nrity karne laga
 After that, Prithviraj started the war with the Yavanasanis after getting out of the horse
 apane praharon or garjana se prithviraj ke shatruon ke hriday main bhay utpann ho gaya
 Prithviraj was surrounded by the soldiers from all around, like the snake has birds around it
 prithviraj ne anek yavansainikon ke saath yuddh armbh kar diya
 At that time a paramilitary threw a cord from Prithviraj's cervix
 tatpashchaat sabhi sainikon ne milakar prithviraj ke upar akraman kar diya
 In the end Prithviraj was held captive by the soldiers after prolonged struggle
 bandi hone ke pashchaat prithviraj kii apane jivan or bhojan main ruchi hi lupt ho gai
 Someone pleaded to the maledictions that "bharteshwar Prithviraj had left you many times, wouldn't you leave him even once?"
 us vyakti kaa vachan sunakar kuddh ghori bolaa, "isiliye ye hindu rajnatik rahasyon se hin bole jate hai"
 After that Ghori sent Prithviraj to the prison of another fort
 croor yawanon ne prithviraj ko karagaar main hi andh kar diya
 Thereafter, Shivmatanuayi, who is called Shiva, Buddhamatanuayi, who is called Sugat, Jainmatanuayi, who is known as Omniscience, went to Bharatheshwar Prithviraj Shivdham remembering the nature of that wonderful Chinmaya Brahman
 viruddhavidhividhvanskavy ke rachayita lakshmidhar hai
 This poem was composed on the auspicious date of Chaitramas of Vikram Samvatsar in 1582
 viruddhavidhividhwans ke rachayita lakshmidhar ke pitamah vaaman the
 When Someshwar was coming from Anhilpatan region towards Ajayameru family, he was accompanied by the Nagarabrahmans like Camas, Bhuvanacamall, Sodh etc
 socia ke do putr the
 Skanda and Vamana
 skanda or vaaman prithviraj ke mantrimandal ke sadsy the
 Skanda was the general and Vamana was the conspirator
 viruddhavidhividhwans main vaaman ke prutra lakshmidhar ne likhaa he ki, jab ghori kaa prithviraj ke saath pratham narin kaa yuddh hua, tab skanda ne asaadhaaran pradarshan kiya
 When Prithviraj was defeated in the Second World War, the Indigenous monarch Vamana stole 2,002,000 dhamma-mudras from the treasury of Ajmeru and fled
 aage viruddhavidhividhvanskavy main lakshmidhar ne likhaa ki, Vypaditasturushkai: sah king jivamritto yudhi 17рее arthath, senapati skanda anyatra yuddh karne ke liye gayi the
 At that time, the king whose intellect was blocked by sleepless addictions, while still alive, was killed by the deceased King Turkushakas
 'kanhad de prabandh' kavy ke rachayita padmanabh hai
 This poem was presented in 1455 AD
 padmanabh visalnagar-sampradaay ke brahman the
 This Padmanabha was the royalty of Akhairaj, the fifth descendant of Kanhaddev, the ruler of Jalore state
 akhairaj ke aadesh se hi usne "kanhad de prabandh" naamak kavy kii rachaana kii thi
 The language of this poem is 'gurjarajasthani'
 1368 vikram sanvatsar main jalaur pradesh ke shaasha 'kanhad de chouhan' kii dehali ke raja allaudin khalji ke saath jo yuddh hua tha, vah itihaas ke mahatvapurn or prasiddh yudhon main gina jaataa he
 Although 'kanhad de Chauhan' knew that the Yavanas had invaded Jalaurdurg from all four sides and there was no way of victory, yet 'kanhad de Chauhan' with his son Veeramdev came out of the fort to protect the Kulparampara
 Made war
 jalauradurg se baahar hi un donon pita-putr kii mrityu ho gai
 The reason for Alauddin Khalji's war with Kanhad de Chauhan is found in the book titled "kanhad de Prabandha"
 padmanabh "kanhad de prabandh" naamak apane kavy main ullikhat karte hai ki, allaudin khalji kii putree sitai viramdev ko prem karti thi
 She wanted to marry Veeramdev itself
 parantu vijaateey stri ke saath vivaah viramdev ke liye ayogy tha
 Because he thought that, thus marrying an alien would offend the ancestors
 yadhyapi firoja jaanati thi ki, viramdev kyon barambar uske pranaynivedan asweekaar kar rahe he, tathaapi firoza ne anekbar viramdev ko patr likhen
 Feroza's statement was that, i was a rajini named Padmavati of Prithviraj in my previous birth
 atah ham donon kaa pranay na keval is janm kaa he, api tu anek janm se he
 So please do not reject my request
 viramdev ko firoza ne jo kaha, wo nimna he

 Through the above verses, the princess is saying that, i accepted many births to get you
 mere chhaaanwein janm main main palhan-vanshiyon kii putree ke rup main janmi thi
 In that birth you were Prithviraj, the son of Someswara
 us janm main maine ghorpaap kiya tha
 To control you as Prithviraj, i killed cow
 us gau ke garbhashay ko nikaal kar us garbhashay par apni tantrik vidhi kii thi
 Prithviraj was subjugated to me by that tantric method, but he was alienated from the royalty
 uske pashchaat ghori naamak mlechharaja ne jab prithviraj kii ghaggharandi ke tir par vadh kar diya, tab apane satidharm kaa avlamban karte hue maine bhi ayodhya main apane deh tyaag diya
 The book 'jawami ul Hikayat' was written by Maulana Nasruddin Muhammad Ufi
 i
 1211 us granth kaa rachanakaal mana jaataa he
 He mentions that when the two armies reached the ranges, shibir kaka was constructed by the soldiers of both the camps
 parantu ghori ne apane sainikon ko pehle hi aadesh diya tha ki, anek kashtha ekatrit kar lewein
 Because his plan was that before Shibir, we would confuse the enemies by keeping the fire burning
 ham raatri ko hi anya maarg se shatruon ke shibir ke prishthbhag main pahunch jaayenge
 After that, we will attack at Brahmamuhurta itself
 ghori kii yojana safala hui, shibir main sthit swalp sainik puri raat shibir ke sammukh agni prajwalit kar baithe rahen
 Due to which Prithviraj's soldiers thought that, Turaksena is in the front shibir
 ghori apane sainikon ke saath puri raatri yatra karke 'cola' kii shibir ke prishthbhag main pahunchaa
 Ghori then suddenly attacked Prithviraj's army
 yavansainikon ne us akraman main anek hindoosainikon kaa vadh kiya
 Seeing the slaughter of many soldiers from a sudden attack, 'kola' thought that, go back
 parantu tatpashchaat uski sena ke hathi aniyantrit ho gayi or sena main utpaat kii sthiti utpann ho gai
 Ghori then imprisoned Kola
 'taj ul masir' granth kaa lekhak sadruddin bin hasan nijaami naishapuri tha
 According to Yavan Panchang, the composition of this book It took place between 603-614
 hasan nijaami ekmaatr vaideshik lekhak he, jisane narinyuddh kaa vivaran diya he
 In that book, a description of the difference of the first Narayan war is found
 jab ghori ne apni paraajay kaa pratishodh lene ke liye ahoratr parishram kiya
 Then there was war and in the end 'islam' was conquered
 ekalakh se adhik hindooon kaa vadh kiya gaya
 Ajayameru Rai was made a prisoner, but then he was freed
 ajayameru raay mukt to hue, parantu uske hriday main yawanon ke liye dwesh tha hi
 So he started planning
 jab ghori ko uske aacharan ke vishay main jyata hua, tab usne ajayameru raaj ke vadh kaa aadesh de diya
 Thereafter, Ajayameru Rai was crowned with a sword studded with pearls
 ghori ke aadesh se ajayameru raay kaa shir unke putr ko bhijwaya gaya
 The author of the book 'tabakate Nasiri' was Abu Umar Minhajuddin Usman bin siraj-ud-din Muhammad Mujjjani
 us granth kaa rachanakaal i
 1259-60 mana jaataa he
 Minhaj has written describing the war that, although there was a vast army of Hindus, he was defeated by Yavasena
 'allah' ne yavansena par upkaar kiya, jisase hindooon kii sena parajeet hui
 Raipithaura was first fighting the war by sitting on an elephant, after that he climbed on the horse and ran to the Sarsi region
 parantu vahaan vah yavansainikon dwaara bandi bana liya gaya
 Then he was sent to hell
 dehali ke govindaray ko bhi bandi banya gaya or uskaa shirishchhedan karke ghori ke sammukh uskaa shir prastut kiya gaya
 Ghori, seeing two fragmentary teeth of that head, knew that it was Govandarai
 ghori ne sapadalakshasamrajya kii rajdhani ko chhodkar haansi, sarsi, digar ityadi pradeshon par apana aadhipaty prasthaapit kar diya
 In 588 years, the fame of the Yavans increased and Ghori Aibak went to Gajni state by giving him royalty
 qutubuddin abak ne bhi meerut ityadi sthanon par akraman karke apane aadhipaty kaa vistaar kiya
 Abdur Rahman Chishti was the author of the book 'meerate Masoodi'
 prithviraj 'abu jalah' ho gaya
 Ghori repeatedly asked Prithviraj to accept 'bait'
 parantu prithviraj ne yab 'bait' kaa angikaar nahin kiya, tab ghori ne uski hatya kar di
 
 'phutuhussalatin' granth kaa lekhak isami tha
 Pithorarai was imprisoned, after which he was presented before Ghori
 ghori ne uske shirishchhedan kaa aadesh diya
 Only such a description is found in the Futuhstalin Granth
 parantu usamen 'karvaa' naamak kavachan kaa varnan or ghori ke senapation ke naam bhi praapt hote hai
 The author of the Tarikh Farishta book was Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah Farishta
 farista iran-deshiy tha
 His ancestors were Hindus
 uske purvaj panjaab pradesh or afghanisthaan pradesh ke simavarti pradeshon ke 'hindu shahiya' vansh ke the
 When was the religion of Islam declared by the ancestors of the angel? It is not received

 1582 varsh main farista apane pita ke saath maharashtrarajya ke ahmadanar ke nizaam shahi sultan murtaja nizaam shah ke rajbhavan main gaya tha
 He was then twelve years old
 vahaan farista ke pita shikshak ke rup main niyukt hue the
 Angel also became a part of the army
 uske pashchaat padonnati hote hi vah rakshakadal kaa adhyaksh ban gaya
 Farishta was the Yavana of the panth named тАШshiaтАЩ

 So he left Ahmed-nagar and went to Bijapur for a livelihood
 bijapur main nivas karte hue ibrahim shah-dwitiyity ke aadesh se tavaarikh naamak granth kii rachana kii
 In the year 1606, that book was completely completed
 narin yuddh kaa varnan jis granth me praapt hota he, us granth kaa naam 'gulshane-ibrahimi' he
 That book is famous by the name of 'date Farishta'
 us granth main ullekh he ki, pithorarai kinchit dur gaya tha, tabhi turkasainikon ne use bandi bana liya
 Then Ghori killed him
 aaine akabari granth main ullikhit he ki, ant main raja yuddh main bandi hua
 After that Ghori took them and went to Ghazni region
 chandrabaradaayi bhi apane swamibhakti kaa nirvaah karne ke liye vahaan pahunchaa
 Chandbaradayi trusted Ghori and appointed him in his service
 chandabaradaayi ne prayatnon se prithviraj ke kargaar ke vishay main jaan liya or prithviraj ke saath mantranaa karke usne prithviraj ko santvana di
 Chandbarai said to Prithviraj, "I will praise your archery in front of Ghori and decorate her to see your skill
" us samay aap avasraanusaar use maar deven"
 Prithviraj was adorned to demonstrate archery skills while supporting Chandbaradayi's plan
 phir unhone ek baan se hi ghori kaa vadh kar diya
 Seeing Ghori's murder, his soldiers attacked Chandbaradiyi and Prithviraj
 ant main un donon kii hatya kar di
 In the Indian source, as the description of all the authors is different, so is the description of the writers of Persian language
 farsigranthon main anek lekhakon kaa mat he ki, prithviraj kii mrityu rankshetra main hui thi
 Whatever description has been introduced by Indian writers and by Persian writers in their texts, that description was comparatively studied and those statements were divided into three parts
 prayek lekhak narinyuddh kii, prithviraj kii mrityu kii or ghori kii mrityu ke vishay main bhinn bhinn vivaran dete hai
 Indian writers and Persian writers are divided into three divisions according to their description
 narinyuddh ke vivaran main jo bhartiyalekhakon or farsilekhakon ne vibhinn varnan kiye, un varnanon ko teen vibhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 One of the sections describing the Narayan war is that Prithviraj was in captivity in the Ghazni region
 phir unke mitra chandabaradaayi vahaan pahunche
 Ghori died due to the combined efforts of both of them
 phir un donon ne aatmghaat kar liya
 This is the story of Prithviraj Raso poetry
 'aaine akabari' kaa varnan prithviraj raso kavy ke anugun hi he, parantu us kavy me lekhak ne sthiti kaa koi varnan nahin kiya he
 a similar description of Prithviraj Raso poetry is found in the Surjancharitamahakaavya
 parantu vahaan rasokavy se adhik pruthakta dikhti he
 According to Surjancharit, after the slaughter of Ghori, Chand and Prithviraj succeeded in migrating safely from the Ghazni region
 phir sapadalakshrajya main hi un donon kii mrityu hui
 There is a section which says that Prithviraj died in the Rangana during the Narayan war
 us varg main pramukhatya farsibhasha ke granth 'tabakaate nasiri', 'phutuhussalatin' or 'gulshane ibrahimi' hai
 The Indian source has only two texts
 viruddhavidhividhwansah or 'kanhad de prabandh'
 In Narayan's war, Prithviraj was captured and Ghori took him to the throne of Ajayameru, then Prithviraj planned against Ghori, who became aware of Ghori
 us samay ghori ne prithviraj ke vadh kaa aadesh diya ye varnan jin granthon main miltaa he, ve is varg main antarbhoot hote hai
 Such descriptions are found in Persian texts like 'tajul Masir', 'jameul Hikayat', 'meerate Masudi' and 'tawarikh of Jammu'
 bhartiyagranthon main puratanprabandhsangrahah, prabandhchintamanih in donon granthon kaa aashay bhi yahi he, parantu jainamtanuai nayanchandsuri ke varnan anusaar ajayameru ke karagaar main anshan se prithviraj ne pranatyag diye
 The attribution of various texts does not prove that, whose death ?, where ?, how? And when? Had happened
 parantu pramaanon ke aadhaar par hi siddh ho saktaa he ki, kiski mrityu ?, kahan ?, kaise ? or kab ? tab hui thi
 Therefore, the evidence of Ghori and Prithviraj's death was analyzed in sequence
 ghori kii mrityu gazani pradesh main prithviraj ke haathon nahin hui thi, api tu prithviraj kii mrityu ke pashchaat chaudaa varsh ghori kii upasthiti ke pramaan praapt hote hai
 Ghori died by Hindus
 ghori kii mrityu ke vishay main anek pramaan praapt hote hai
 The author of the book 'tajul Masir' was Hasan Nizami
 vah apane granth main ullikhit karata he ki, khokhron kaa daman karke ghori varshon bharat main rahakar gazani pradesh waapas ja rahaa tha
 When he reached near Dhamek region, he made shibir in the garden there with flowers like kumud and jasmine
 jab ghori sandhyakalin prarthana main rat tha, tab kuch log vahaan aa pahunche
 He killed Ghori by killing the guards and the workmen
 'tarikhe jahankush' granth kaa lekhak allaudin juvaini tha
 The composition of this book 655 is considered
 minhaj ke 'tabakaate nasiri' granth se teen varsh purv hi allaudin juvaini ke 'tarikhe jahankush' granth kii rachana hui thi
 Describing Ghori's death, Alauddin Juwaini wrote that, "ghori invaded India several times in 602 AD by destroying the Khorasan-province
 vah anek yudhon main vijayi hokar apane sainya ko dhansampann karte ja rahaa tha
 When he was on his way to the Ghazni region by taking Jhemal Pradesh, he put Shibir on the banks of the river 'jihu'
 us shibir main jab ghori madhyahn kaal main nidradhin tha, tab kuch hindooon ne nadi ko langhakar shibir par akraman kar diya
 They murdered Ghori after causing uproar in Shibir
 'tarikhe farista' pustak kaa doosraa naam 'gulshane-ibrahimi' he
 a historian named Briggs translated the book 'tarikhe Farishta'
 vah apane pustak main likhata he ki, '2 Shaban, H
I
 On 602 ', Ghori reached Rohtak village on the arrow of Sindhanadi
 vahaan 20 'gakkhad' logon kaa ek samooh ghori kii hatya ke uddesh se aa pahunchaa
 The relatives of those Hindus were killed by Ghori in the war
 atah ve pratishodh ke liye bahut samay se ghori kii hatya karne ke liye avasar kii pratiksha main the
 It was a sultry atmosphere that day
 atah ghori ke aadesh anusaar sainikon dwaara shibir ke aavaran khule rakkhe the, jis se shibir main vayupravah nirbaadh rahe
 Then when the cover was uncovered by the servants of Ghori, the Hindus knew that opportunity
 phir hindu samooh raatri main hi sena ke sameep main kisi sthaan par chup kar baith gaya
 After that, when one of them reached near Shibir's gate at night, Shibir's gatekeeper stopped him
 us hindu ne chhurika ke praharon se us dwarpal kii hatya kar di
 Chikkar swallowed the mouth of the gatekeeper due to the hard stroke of the blade at the chest
 wo chitkaar sunakak anya sainik bhi shibir ke sameep upasthit ho gayi
 But before that, Hindus entered inside Shibir and killed Ghori
 jab hindooon ne ghori ke shabir main pravesh kiya, tab ghori nidradhin tha
 There were also two servants near Ghori
 parantu hindooon ke haath main shastr dekhakar wein murtiwat baithe rahe
 The Hindus then killed Nidramagn Ghori
 ghori ke sharir par anek vran the
 More than twelve times Hindus attacked Churika
 sabhi aghat ghori ke sharir par pratyaksh dekhe ja sakate the
 Unlike the above mentioned English translation, the original mention is written in the Urdu text
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, itihaas kii ghatana main bhram utpaann karne ke liye athwa bhramavash ashuddh anuwaad hua
 This is what is described in the original version of the book titled 'tarikhe Farishta'
 '2 shaabaan, hi
sa
 602' dinank ko ghori sindusagar ke tat par sthit baramhek-sthaan par pahunchaa
 Shibir Ghori built Shibir there
 phir duusare din ghori kii hatya hui
 a group of 20 'gakkhad' people arrived there with the intention of killing Ghori
 kyonki un hindooon ke sambandhion kii ghori ne hatya karvaa di thi or unako grihaviheen kar diye the
 So they were waiting for the opportunity of killing Ghori for a long time, wishing for vengeance
 ghori yahan shibir banaakar rah rahaa tha, vahaan kisi prakaar wo samooh pahunch gaya
 At that time the soldiers were eager to go further
 ek sevak aavarnon ko nikaal kar ekatrit kar rahaa tha
 At the same time, he entered Hindu Shibir
 ek hindu ne shibir ke dwarpal par chhurika se akraman karke uski hatya kar di
 Then he ran away from that place
 dwarpal kii aahat avasthaa ko dekhakar anya sainik bhi vahaan upasthit ho gayi
 The servant who was involved in calculating the descent, left the work of Shibir of the servant Ghori and went to the gatekeeper
 usee samay hinduunon ne ghori kii shibir main pravesh kiya
 Two or three servants were sitting near Ghori
 parantu hindooon ke haath main shastr dekhakar ve maun hi rahe
 The Hindus attacked Ghori before they could react
 chhurika ke baaise ati kathor prahaar un hindooon ke dwaara kiye gayi
 Ghori died in the end
 'tabakaate nasiri' pustak kaa rachayita kaaji minhaj tha
 It mentions that while Ghori was doing 'magarbi Namaz', he was killed
 'phutuhussalatin' granth main ullekh praapt hota he ki, jab ghori aaagantukon ke saath goshtimagn tha, tabhi aaagantukon main se ek ne ghori ke upar talwaar se akraman kar diya
 Ghori died of a single stroke of the sword
 ghori ne gazani pradesh main do prakaar kii mudraayen prakashit kii
 Of gold and silver
 us mudra kaa naam 'dirham' tha
 Historians have received many currency of Ghori
 keval maishan, princep cabinet sthaan main sangruhit mudraon kaa hi ullekh adhik miltaa he
 The description of the following currencies was proposed by the eminent numerologist Edward Thomas in 1871 in London-city
 sankhya 1, figure 1, swarnadhaatu, bhaar 93 gren, gazanitankashaala Metal - Silver, Weight 74 grains, Time 569 In this mudra, printing like uttamudra is also obtained
 ukt granthon main ghori kii mrityu ke vishay main vividh vivaran praapt hote hai
 Some say that, Ghori was sleeping in the mid-day, others say that, he was busy in evening worship
 koi kahata he ki, vah sainya yatra ke liye sajjataa kar rahaa tha, koi kahata he ki vah aaagantukon ke saath charchamagn tha
 Everyone has different views about the invaders
 vibhinn lekhakon ke mat kaa saar he ki, hindu, gakkhd, mulahida, fidaiyaan, khokhar, ismaili, karamaata ityadi main se kasi vansh main utpann bees logo ne ghori kii hatya kii thi
 In the narration of the said historian, whose description is true and whose false? This knowledge is obtained only through evidence
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, ghori jaise raja kii hatya 20 logo ke samooh ne kar di is vishay main shanka samudbhav hoti he
 Existing Ghori was killed in the array of millions of soldiers, there was no attention of any soldier on it, this description does not seem logical
 parantu farsi-granthon se praapt pramaanon se ghori kii mrityu kaa samay narin ke yuddh ke pashchaat choubees varshon tak siddh hota he
 After the first date of the month of March of 1192, Ghori ruled over the Ghazni region and the Indian states
 uski mrityu '2 shaabaan hi
sa
 602' yavanatithi par hua tha
 Ghori's death has historically supported many Persian texts, and Ghori's twenty-four-year evidence of Indian domination over Indian states has also been found
 dhili-rajavali main pramaan miltaa he ki, ghori ne 1192+14=1206 i

 prithvirajtrutiy tathaa ghori kii sanyuktamudraayen uplabdh hoti hai
 Historians doubt whether Prithviraj had made a treaty with Ghori in the last period? But in the end it was found that, after the defeat of Prithviraj, Ghori published the joint currency of both of them to get protection from the rebellion of the people
 prithvirajsy tathaa ghori kii sanyuktamudraon kaa prapratham prakaashan edward thoms naamak prakhyat mudrashasthri ne kiya tha
 According to his statement, he did not believe that Prithviraj could have a joint currency with Ghori
 kyonki narainyuddh main prithviraj kii parajaya ke anantar ghori unako ajayameru le gaya tha, phir kuch din karagaar main unako sharirakapida dekar ghori ne unki hatya kar di thi
 Therefore, the suspicious Edward Thomas told General Cunningham the received currencies
 general kaningham ne us mudra ke agrabhag or prishthbhag main vidyaman akshar padhe
 At that time, General Cunningham did not have the same currencies
 parantu edward thoms dwaara di gai mudraon se sanyuktamudraayen uplabdh hui
 General Cunningham and Edward Thomas had the same currencies as Nelsen Wright
 un teenon ke paas yadhyapi prithviraj or ghori kii sanyuktamudraayen thi, tathaapi un mudraon kaa bhaar bhinn tha
 1
 Currencies collected by Edward Thomas: - Bharat - 36 grains, front - Prithviraj, cavalry - Nandi Mahmud
 2
 general kaningham dwaara sangruhit mudra :- vyas 55тАЭ, bhaar 55 gren, agrabhag - ashwarohi prithviraj, prishthbhag тАУ nandi mahamad sam 
 3
 Currencies adopted by Nelsen Wright: - Vyas 55 тАЭ, weight 55 grains, horse cavalry Prithviraj, backdrop - Nandi Mahamad Sama ukt sanyuktamudraon kaa adhyayan karke nishkarsh prastut karte hue thoms ne kaha ki, in mudraon kaa prakaashan prithviraj ke putr gownd ne kiya tha
 He published currencies in the name of his father and the then ruler Ghori, in recognition of his power
 general kaningham ke nishkarshanusaar prithviraj kinchit samay paryant ghori ke samant the
 Hence the joint currencies were published
 
 According to the conclusion of Nelsen Wright, after the defeat of Prithviraj, Ghori wanted to establish independence over Ajayameru
 atah usne swayan hi ye mudraayen prakashit kii thi 
 Kunwardevi Singh Mandawa also mentions "ghori did thur mudras prakasik", agreeing with the conclusion of Kalingam and Nelsen
 kunvaradevi kaa tark he ki, ghori ne praja ke manobhaav ko parivartit karne hetu tathaa "prithviraj uske adhinsth raja hai" ye sandesh praja main prasaarit karne sanyuktamudraayen prakashit kii hogi
 His political advantage in it was that, "prithviraj rejected Ghori's rule" This message would not give rise to any rebellion
 ve aage kahati hai ki, jaise praja kii manassthiti kaa laabh praapt karne hetu 'ist india company' dwaara mughal-raja shah alam dwitiya ke naam se mudraayen prasaarit kii gai thi, us se praja main mughal-samrajya ke rajtv main vishwaas akhand hua tha
 The same must have happened then

 dasharath sharma ke matanusaar edward thoms dwaara prastut sanyuktamudraayen prabal kaaran he ki, ghori sapadalaksh samrajya ke samant ke rup main prithviraj ko satta dene kii ichha rakhata tha 
 Dr
 Dineshchandra said that he was unable to give a proof of the actual conclusion regarding the currency, but he opined that these currencies would not have been officially printed by the state printing presses but by other voluntary organizations
 vividh granthon main kaha gaya he ki, narayan ke yudhakshetra main prithviraj maare gayi
 But on the basis of historical background, war and events, the decision regarding the death of Prithviraj in the battlefield is considered unproven
 ghori ke bharat par akraman ke do mukhya uddash the
 First of all, the wealth of India and the expansion of its religion
 narin ke yuddh main ghori ke vijay se uski pratham ichha to purna hui
 But his second motive for denouncing Prithviraj's 'islam' religion was residual
 atah prithviraj kaa jivan anivaary tha
 Evidence of Ghori's second wish is obtainable in various texts
 tajul-masir naamak pustak main ullekh praapt hota he ki, jab ghori apane sainya ke saath lahore pradesh pahunchaa tha, tab usne kwamulmulk ruknuddin hamja naamak doot ko ajayameru prasaad bheja tha
 Ghori had sent the message that, you wear the ornament of slavery in your ears and attend my Rajya Sabha and declare 'islam' religion
 farista main ullikhit he ki, ghori jab lahore pahunchaa tha, tab apane vishwast doot, jiskaa naam kwamulmulk ruknuddin hamja tha, use ajayameru prasaad main bheja tha
 Sent a message with him that, reject the religion of Islam
 farista main aage ullekh prapya he ki, doot se sandesh sunakar prithviraj ati cruddh hue the
 Therefore, Prithviraj addressed the king following the 'islam' religion with abusive words
 us sandesh ke saath doot ko lautaa diya 
 Therefore, Ghori's objective was the universalization of Prithviraj after the conquest of India
 uske liye prithviraj kaa jivan bhi anivaary tha
 Although Ghori could have killed Prithviraj in the Narayan war zone, he went to Ajayameru with Prithviraj
 kyonki prithviraj ke ismali-karan wo chahta tha
 The main soldier of Ghori was Aibak
 narin yuddh ke pashchaat usne samgr yuddh kaa ghatnakram apane rajsabha ke do sadasyon ko kaha
 The two members were Najami and Ufi
 narin yuddh kaa pratyaksh drashtaa abak ke kathananusaar unhone apane granth kaa nirmaan kiya
 Prof
 studying the facts of both of them Mohammad Habib and Prou
 khalik ahamed nijaami ne saar upasthaapit kiya 
 Nizami has written that, Ghori took Prithviraj to Ajayemaru
 tatpashchaat prithviraj ne ghori ke viruddh jab kuchakr kiya, to ghori ne samachar milte hi prithviraj kii hatya kar di
 The description found in the book titled Tajul Masir also supports the Indian source
 hasan nijaami ne bhi kisi durgoshtee kii charchaa kii he, parantu uske vishay main kuch bhi vivaran praapt nahin hota he
 As a result of that conspiracy, Ghori killed Prithviraj, it is mentioned by him
 pro
 es ech hodivaala ne apane pustak main likhaa he ki, jab prithviraj ke paramamitra or sahaayak udayraj ko prithviraj ke karagaravaas ke samachar mili, tab vah aatmaglani se duhkhit ho gaya
 He thought that, if i abandon the owner who is suffering, and flee, then my cow dynasty will be stunned
 atah usne dilli par akraman kiya or dilli ke durg par chaaron ore se akraman kar diya
 At that time, someone in Ghori's assembly said to Ghori, "these Prithviraj left you many times, won't you leave them even once?"
 ghori ne us vachan ko sunakar sakrodh kaha, tere jaise logon ke paraamarsh se rajya nasht ho jaayenga
 Ghori then sent Prithviraj to the fortress of Ajayameru
 pro
 hodivaala ke kathananusaar jis vyakti ne prithviraj kii mukti kaa paraamarsh diya tha, vah prithviraj ke vyakti the
 Due to the threat of evil around him, Ghori took Prithviraj to the kingdom of Ajayameru
 is prakaar ghori narin yuddh ke pashchaat prithviraj ko dilli se ajayameru le gaya or vahaan prithviraj kii hatya kii
 The conspiracy described by Hasan Nizami finds mention in the subject called the Puranabhistabhandrasagraha
 vahaan ullikhit he ki, jab mlechhraj ne prithviraj ko chhoda, tab prithviraj ne pratishodh ke liye yojana banaai
 But his treacherous minister told Ghori the plan
 merutung dwaara rachit prabandhchintamani main varnan praapt hota he ki, ghori chitrashaala main 'muslim' logon ko maarthe hue shukaron ko dekh kar kupit ho gaya
 After that, he surrendered Prithviraj
 parantu us varnan main susangata maani nahin jaati he
 Because Ghori knew that, not only Prithviraj, all the kings of Api Tu Chauhan dynasty hated the Gaubhakshi Muslims
 nijaami ne varnan kiya he ki, ghori prithviraj ko lekar ajayameru gaya or unhen chod diya
 It is also mentioned in the Prabandha Chintaman that Prithviraj ascended the throne of Ajayameru
 jinprabh suri naamak jainacharya ke kathan anusaar ghori ne ajayameru main prithviraj kii hatya kar di thi

 The details of where and when Prithviraj died was found to be different in different texts
 parantu prithviraj kii mrityu ajmeru ke prasaad main hui thi ye vidvan siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 
 ghori kisi bhi prakaar prithviraj ko 'islam' dharm swikaarne ko vivash karnaa chahta tha
 Therefore, he was ready to establish a co-ethical relationship with Prithviraj
 parantu prithviraj 'islam' dharm ke asweekaar par drudhsankalp the
 Dr
 Hemachandra Rai writes that, "by seeing the history and self-respect of the Chauhan dynasties, there could not have been a confinement of life or slave life for Prithviraj"
 atah prithviraj ke paas dwo maarg the
 Protection of treaty or self-respect using political pragmatism
 prithviraj ne dwitiya maarg kaa chayan kiya
 After getting a negative response from Prithviraj, Ghori got burnt in anger
 atah vah prithviraj se apana icchit kaary karwaane ko unako sharirak or maansik yatnaa dene laga
 Prithviraj did not succumb to Ghori's deathly suffer
 atah usne kootneeti purvak prithviraj ko 'islam' dharm kaa angikaar karaane hetu shadyantra rachaa
 Ghori sent traitor minister Pratapsingh who served Ghori for many years near Prithviraj
 pratapsingh kaa uddesh tha ki, kisi bhi prakaar se prithviraj ko 'islam' dharm kaa angikar karne ke liye sajj karnaa
 Therefore, he kept explaining to Prithviraj for a few days
 prithviraj ne pratapsingh par vishwaas karke use apane man kii vyathaa bataai or banvedh kii yojana bhi bataai
 Banvedh's plan is described as a conspiracy in a book called Nizami
 banvedh kii pushti anek granthon main praapt hoti hi he or aitihaasik ghatnakram bhi uski ore sanket karata he
 On the orders of Ghori, Pratap Singh, the minister of Prithviraj, explained to Prithviraj to reject the 'islam' religion
 "ghori kaa vadh karnaa chahta hoon" aisa prithvirajh ne pratapsingh ko kaha
 Prithviraj further said that, i am capable of running a worded arrow
 meri us vidya kaa main pradarshan karne ke liye sajj hoon
 Any way you look forward to watching Ghori displaying my knowledge
 tatpashchaat rajsabha main shabdavedh baan ke pradarshan ke samay ghori kahan sthit he ye mujhe kahana
 i will take my vengeance by slaughtering Ghori with the word arrow
 parantu pratapsingh ne prithviraj kii sahayata karne ke sthaan par prithviraj kii yojana ke sandarbh main ghori ko suchit kar diya
 When Ghori heard about Prithviraj's plan, his anger also arose with anger
 uski kalpana bhi nahin thi ki, koi bhi andh vyakti dhwani sunakar lakshya bhedan karne main sakasham ho saktaa he
 But when the minister repeatedly said about Prithviraj's mastery, Ghori wanted to see the performance of the worded arrow
 ghori ne apane sthaan par lohe kii yaa paththar kii ek murti sthapit kar di thi
 After this Pratap Singh gave a bow in the hands of Prithviraj in the assembly
 ghori ne jab lakshya bhedane kaa aadesh diya, tab anukshan hi prithviraj ne baan chalaa diya
 With that arrow, that idol has two parts
 deshadroh hone se prithviraj kaa antim praayas bhi api vifal ho gaya
 According to the description of Hasan Nizami, the angry Ghori then ordered Prithviraj to be killed
 uske pashchaat ek muslim sainik ne ratnajdit suvarnayukt ek asi se prithviraj kii hatya kar di
 Thus, Prithviraj's lifeline ended in Ajayamuru
 uske pashchaat unka aurdhvadaihik sanskaar ajayameru main hi unke anuj hariraj ke hothon hua

 Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin was one of the Russian-language poetical poets who is considered the best poet of Russian
 unhen aadhunik roosi kavita kaa sansthaapak bhi mana jaataa he
 We can understand Pushkin's short life span of 38 years by dividing it into 5 sections
 26 may 1799 ko unke janm se 1820 tak kaa samay balykaal or praarambhik sahitya rachana ko sametataa he
 The period from 1820 to 1824 is the exile period
 1824 se 1826 ke bich ve mikhayelovscoye main rahe
 He reached the peak of fame in 1826тАУ1831, approaching the Tsar
 1831 se unki mrityu tak kaa kaal unke liye bada duhkhadaayi rahaa
 At the age of twelve, Pushkin was sent to study at Tsarskoyeselow's boarding school
 san 1817 main pushkin padhai puri kar saint petersburg aa gaye or videsh mantralay ke kaaryon ke atirikt unka sara samay kavita karne or mouj udaane main beetaa, isi dauraan sena ke noujvaan afasaron dwaara banaai gai saahitiyik sanstha greenlamp main bhi unhone janaa shuru kar diya tha, jahaan unki kavita kaa swaagat hua
 Using the freedom to express his views in a free environment, Pushkin wrote poems like Odd to Liberty, Chadayev and in the country
 dakshin main yekaterinoslav, kakeshas or kreemia kii apni yatraaon ke dauraan unhone khub padhaa or khub likhaa, isi bich ve biimaar bhi pade or general rayevski ke parivaar ke saath kakeshas or kreemia gaye
 This journey became memorable in Pushkin's life
 kakeshas kii khubasurat vaadiyon main ve romantic kavi byran kii kavita se parichit hue
 In 1823, he was sent to Odessa
 oddesa main jin do striyon se unki najdikiyaan raheen unamem ek thi ek sarb vyapaaree kii italian patni emilia rigenich or duusari thi praant ke governor general kii patni countes vorontsov
 These two women made a deep impression in Pushkin's life
 pushkin ne bhi donon se samaan bhav se prem kiya or apni kavitaayen bhi unhen samarpit kin
 But on the other hand, the increased proximity to the Countess was not in his interest
 unhen apni maan kii jaagir mikhayelovscoye main nirvasit kar diya gaya
 In the two years that Pushkin spent in this remote northern corner of Russia, he was mostly alone
 par yahi samay tha jab unhone yevgeni anegin or boris godunov jaisi vikhyath rachanaayen puri kin tathaa anek sundar kavitaayen likhin
 Finally, in 1826, at the age of 27, Pushkin was recalled from exile by Tsar Nicholas to St
 Petersburg
 mulaakaat ke dauraan jaar ne pushkin se us kathith shadyantr kii babat poocha bhi jisaki badaulat unhen nirvaasan bhogana padaa tha
 He remained suspicious in the eyes of power and his creations had to fall prey to the censors, but Pushkin's love for freedom always persisted
 san 1828 main masco main ek nrity ke dauraan pushkin kii bhent nathalya goncharova se hui
 In the spring of 1829 he proposed marriage to Natalya
 anek baadhaon ke baavjood san 1831 main pushkin kaa vivaah nathalya ke saath ho gaya
 Pushkin's married life was not happy
 isaki jhalak unke likhe patron main milti he, pushkin kaa takaraav nathalya goncharova ke ek diwane francisi da'antes se hua jo jaar nicholas kaa darbari tha
 It is said that d'antes had fallen in love with Natalya
 da'antes ne nathalya kii bahan catherine se vivaah kaa prastaav rakhaa
 He and Natalya then met in hiding, and the conditions worsened
 yah pushkin ko sahan nahin hui or vah da'antes ko dwandv yuddh kaa nimantran de baitha
 In a duel war on 27 January 1837, Pushkin was badly wounded by d'antes' bullets and died two days later on 29 January 1837 at the age of 38
 pushkin kii achaanak hui maut se sansani fail gai
 a crowd of around fifty thousand people, including students, workers and intellectuals, had gathered in St
 Petersburg to pay tribute to the poet, leaving the so-called nobles of erstwhile Russian society

 This year's theme is "the Changing Face of Translation and Interpreting"
 antarrashtriya anuwaad diwas har saal 30 sitambar ko saint jerome ke parv par manaaya jaataa he, bible anuvadak jise anuvaadakon ke sangrakshak sant mana jaataa he
 Since being established in 1953, the ceremony has been encouraged by the FIT

 An amplifier or amplifier is a device that changes the value of an electrical signal, the electrical signal can be in the form of voltage or current
 aajkal saamaanya prachlan main pravardhak se aashay kisi 'electronic pravardhak' se hi hota he
 There are many types of amplifiers in different areas and according to different types of requirements
 shakti pravardhak kaa kaary voltage pravardhak se praapt output ko shakti pradaan karnaa he
 The voltage amplifier amplifies the electric wave received by the microphone, when delivered directly to the loudspeaker it will not be able to convert it back into sound waves
 atah voltage pravardhak se praapt output ko ek shakti pravardhak ko diya jaataa he
 Thereby providing operable power to the loudspeaker
 "vah transistor pravardhak jo audio aavriti siganlon ke power str ko badhaata he, trangistor audio shakti pravardhak kehalaata he"
 There are other types of power amplifiers, such as video power amplifier, which are used to make video signals powerful
 isi prakaar radio aavriti shakti pravardhak radio aavriti ke sanketon ko shakti pradaan karata he
 Actually no power amplifier amplifies the power, rather it takes power from the connected dc supply at the output and converts it to ac signal power
 chunki yah voltage pravardhak se praapt ucch voltage signal kaa pravardhan karata he atah ise large signal pravardhak kahana uchit hoga
 According to the maximum power transfer theorem, the maximum power in a network will transfer only when the load resistance is equal to the source resistance

 Look at the same words
 "the Europeans always confuse things, when they consider the fact that the Afghans call themselves Bani Israel and yet reject their Jewish descent
 Indeed, the Afghans discard the very idea of any descent from the Jews
 They, however, yet claim themselves to be of Bani Israel
" ladli ise samajhane kii koshish karte hue likhata he ki daaud ke ghar se alag hone ke baad bani israel main se keval yahuda ke gharaane kaa naam yahudee padaa evam uske baad se unka apana anya bani israel se alag itihaas hai usee ke shabdon main dekhen to vah is prakaar likhata he
 "israelites, or the Ten Tribes, to whom the term Israel was applied - after their separation from the House of David, and the tribe of Judah, which tribe retained the name of Judah and had a distinct history ever after

 No one can tell the reason for this other than what these people claim

 His words are as follows
 "but there is one important people who call themselves Bani Israel, who claim a descent from Cush and Ham, who have adopted a strange mixture of Mosaic Law in Ordinances in their moral code, who keep a feast which strongly accords with the Passover,


 and for whom no one has yet been able to suggest any other origin than the one they claim, and claim with determined force, and these people are the overwhelming inhabitants of Afghanistan

 Traditions go orally generation after generation
 deshon ke itihaas kaa bada hissaa likhit record par nahin balki isi prakaar kii maukhik paramparao ke marfat zindaa rahata he
 In his words, he is like this
 "the Afghan tribes, among whom the Jews have lived for generations, are Moslems who retain to this day their amazing tradition about their descent from the Ten Tribes
 It is an ancient tradition, and one not without some historical plausibility
 a number of explorers, Jewish and non-jewish, who visited Afghanistan from time to time, and students of Afghan affairs who probed into literary sources, have referred to this tradition, which was also discussed in several encyclopedias in European languages
 The fact that this tradition, and no other, has persisted among these tribes is itself a weighty consideration
 Nations normally keep alive memories passed by word of mouth from generation to generation, and much of their history is based not on written records but on verbal tradition
 This was particularly so in the case of the nations and the communities of the Levant
 The people of the Arabian Peninsula, for example, derived all their knowledge of an original pagan cult, which they abandoned in favor of Islam, from such verbal tradition
 So did the people of Iran, formerly worshipers of the religion ofzoroaster; the Turkish andmongol tribes, formerlybuddhists and Shamanists; and the Syrians who abandoned Christianity in favor of Islam
 Therefore, if the Afghan tribes persistently adhere to the tradition that they were once Hebrews and in course of time embraced Islam, and there is not an alternative tradition also existent among them, they are certainly Jewish

 Ecology is also known as Environmental Biology
 is vishay main vyakti, jansankhya, samudaayon or echosystem kaa adhyayan hota he
 The term ecology, the first ecology, was used in 1866 by the German biologist Ernest H├дckel in his book "general Morpology Late Organisms"
 beesvin sadi ke armbh main manushya or uske paryaavaran ke bich sambandhon par adhyayan prarambh hua or ek saath kai vishyon main is ore dhyaan diya gaya
 The result was the compilation of human ecology
 prakritik vaataavaran behad jatil he isliye shodhakarta adhikanshat: kisi ek kism ke praaniyon kii nasl yaa paudhon par shodh karte hai
 For example mankind builds on the earth and also affects vegetation
 manushya vanaspati kaa kuch bhaag seven karte hai or kuch bhaag bilkul hi anopyogi chhod dete hai
 Those plants continue to spread
 beesvin shatabdi sadi main ye gyaat hua ki manushyon kii gatividhiyon kaa prabhaav prithvi or prakruti par sarvada sakaaratmak hi nahin padataa rahaa he
 Then humans became aware of the serious impact on the environment

 There are mainly two types of components of an ecosystem - paristhitiki sajivon or unke nirjeev paryaavaran ke madhya sambandhon kaa adhyayan alag-alag staron yaa paimaanon par karti he
 From a living cell to organ, organism, population, community, ecosystem, biome and biosphere, interactions between organisms and their environment have different forms and evolution
 atah paristhitikeey adhyayan ke staron main pramukh hai: Like other ancient religions, Vedic philosophy has also believed that nature is vibrated with life
 sampoorn charachar jagat arthath prithvi, akaash, swarg, aag, vaayu, jal, vanaspati or jeev-jantu sab main daivatv kii dhara pravaahit he
 Knowledge of this approach comes from the fact that when Shakuntala of Kalidas, who grew up in an ashram in the lap of nature, started going to the city to meet her husband Dushyant, the trees and flowers, the deer fed by her, were very sad
 Happened
 yahaan tak ki lataaon ne bhi apane pile pattey jhaadkar rudan karnaa shuru kar diya
 In that era there was complete identification and direct contact between man and nature
 manushya kii aavashyaktaaen simit thim or santosh itan tha ki prakruti ke shoshan kii baat to vah sapane main bhi nahin soch saktaa tha
 Close association with nature was the heart of all religions
 samay ke saath shaharikaran or audyogikaran ke chalate manushya kaa prakruti se sampark tuutata gaya or tathakthith vikaas kii andhi daud main uski yah anubhuti samaapt ho gai ki prakruti bhi ek jivant shakti he
 The Vedic ethos refers to a holistic life in which the needs of the body, intellect, mind and soul are taken care of
 sharir kii moolbhoot aavashyaktaa he khaanaa, kapadaa, makaan or iske baad chikitsa va anya sabhi bhautik sukh-suvidhaayen
 The mind is the center of desires, which wants wishes to be fulfilled
 lekin buddhi aavashyaktaaon ko simit karne tathaa ichchhaaon ko niyantrit karne ke liye is tarah maargdarshan karti he ki prakruti ke punarchakreekaran kii prakriya va sabhy samaaj ke maheen tantu ast-vyast nahin hon
 According to a paper presented by Mr
 Gulab Kothari in Melbourne, so-called educated people are responsible for the destruction of ecology and environmental harmony

 in bhashaaon main aise praavdhaan hai jo ek saath kai kaary kakaraane vaale program likhane mensaaayak hoti hai
 Assembly languages which statically link data inline with instructions can also be considered data-structured, in the most primitive way
 ye bhashaayen kisi samasya kaa varnan karne ke liye upyukt hai na ki kisi samaadhaan yaa hal ke liye
 These languages are designed to test the limits of other programming languages
 ye bhashaayen kisi duusare program main 'imbed' kiye jane yogya program likhane ke liye bani hai
 These languages define all programs and subroutines as functions
 Interactive mode languages act as a kind of shell: expressions or statements can be entered one at a time, and the result of their evaluation is seen immediately
 Interpreted languages are programming languages which programs may be executed from source code form, by an interpreter
 Theoretically, any language can be compiled or interpreted, so the term * interpreted language * generally refers to languages that are usually interpreted rather than compiled
 Iterative languages are built around or offering generators
 List-based languages are a type of data-structured language that are based upon the list data structure
 Little languages serve a specialized problem domain
 Logic-based languages specify a set of attributes that a solution must have, rather than a set of steps to obtain a solution
 Examples: Machine languages are directly executable by a computer's CPU
 They are typically formulated as bit patterns, usually represented in octal or hexadecimal
 Each group of npatterns causes the circuits in the CPU to execute one of the fundamental operations of the hardware
 The activation of specific electrical inputs, and logical settings for CPU state values, control the processor's computation
 Individual machine languages are processor specific and are not portable
 They are always defined by the CPU developer, not by 3rd parties
 The symbolic version, the processor's assembly language, is also defined by the developer, in most cases
 Since processors come in families which are based on a shared architecture, the same basic assembly language style can often be used for more than one CPU
 Each of the following cpus served as the basis for a family of processors: Macro languages embed small pieces of executable code inside a piece of free-form text
 Scripting languages such as Tcl and ecmascript have been embedded into applications so that they behave like macro languages
 Metaprogramming is writing of programs that write or manipulate other programs as their data or that do part of the work that is otherwise done at run time during compile time
 In many cases, this allows programmers to get more done in the same amount of time as they would take to write all the code manually
 Multiparadigm languages support more than one programming paradigm
 They allow a program to use more than one programming style
 The goal is to allow programmers to use the best tool for a job, admitting that no one paradigm solves all problems in the easiest or most efficient way
 Class-based object-oriented programming languages support objects defined by their class
 Class definitions include member data
 Message passing is a key concept in object-oriented languages
 Polymorphic functions parameterized by the class of some of their arguments are typically called methods
 In languages with single dispatch, classes typically also include method definitions
 In languages with multiple dispatch, methods are defined by generic functions
 There are exceptions where single dispatch methods are generic functions 
 Prototype-based languages are object-oriented languages where the distinction between classes and instances have been removed: Off-side rule languages are those where blocks are formed, indicated, by their indentation
 Procedural programming languages are based on the concept of the unit and scope
 a procedural program is composed of one or more units or modules, either user coded or provided in a code library; Each module is composed of one or more procedures, also called a function, routine, subroutine, or method, depending on the language
 Examples of procedural languages include: Reflective languages let programs examine and possibly modify their high level structure at runtime
 This is most common in high-level virtual machine programming languages like Smalltalk, and less common in lower-level programming languages like C
 Languages and platforms supporting reflection: Rule-based languages instantiate rules when activated by conditions in a set of data
 Of all possible activations, some set will be selected and the statements belonging to those rules will be executed
 Examples of rule-based languages include: "scripting language" has two apparently different, but in fact similar meanings
 In a traditional sense, scripting languages are designed to automate frequently used tasks that usually involve calling or passing commands to external programs
 Many complex application programs allow users to implement custom functions by providing them with built-in languages
 Those which are of interpretive type, are often called scripting languages
 More recently many of these applications have chosen to "build in" traditional scripting languages, such as Perl or Visual Basic, but there are quite a few "native" scripting languages still in use
 Many scripting languages are compiled to bytecode and then this platform independent bytecode is run through a virtual machine
 Stack-based languages are a type of data-structured language that are based upon the stack data structure
 Synchronous programming languages are optimized for programming reactive systems, systems that are often interrupted and must respond quickly
 Many such systems are also called realtime systems, and are found often in embedded uses
 Examples: These languages assist with generating lexical analzyers and parsers for Context-free grammars
 Visual programming languages let users specify programs in a two-dimensional way, instead of as one-dimensional text strings, via graphic layouts of various types
 Some dataflow programming languages are also visual languages
 Computer scientist Niklaus Wirth designed and implemented several influential languages
 These are languages based on or that operate on XML
 Although the big-boy equivalents of Oracle / postgresql / MSSQL don't yet exist for XML, there are languages to navigate through it and its more tree-oriented structure
