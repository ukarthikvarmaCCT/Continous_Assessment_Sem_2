 According to the most recent scientific assessment of the effects of the Montreal Protocol, "the Montreal Protocol is working: clear evidence exists of a reduction in the atmospheric burden of ozone-depleting substances and some early signs of improvement in the ozone layer

 The Montreal Protocol currently calls for the phased containment of hcfcs by 2030, but does not impose any restriction on hfcs
 Since cfcs themselves are just as potent as greenhouse gases, the use of hfcs in place of cfcs is not only increasing anthropogenic global warming, but increasing their use over time may increase the risk that human activities will alter the climate

 parantu is vachanpaalan kaa aadhyatmik or naitik mulya rahaa he, iske peeche kanoon kaa haath nahin tha or na isko koi vaidhanik manyata praapt thi
 But gradually, the experience of pledging in business relations and the need to give legal recognition to it, along with the decline of values and morals, the society has experienced this and that is why the pledge in moral and spiritual terms has become secondary, following the statutory recognized business utterances Importance gained prominence
 vyavsaayik or kanoonee drushti se is sambandh main rome kaa kanoonee itihaas rochak he
 The oldest form of contract was there
 apane mul rup main yah udhaar vastuvikray se sambandhit tha
 Gradually it started being used for loans too
 isaki katipay aupchaariktaayen thim jinke bina kii purnataa praapt nahin hoti thi
 In India also, there are references in Narada and Jupiter's texts about the relationship of commodity, debt, partnership and success
 kintu vartmaan sanvida kaa swaroop usase bhinn he, yadhyapi uske vikaas kii kadi unase bhi jodi ja sakati he
 The current contract is characterized by its legal validity
 vah prayek vachan athwa qaraar jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey ho athwa jiskaa kanoon dwaara paalan karaayaa ja sake, sanvida he
 In ancient times, this legal recognition was not a special force but the emphasis was that if any formality was reduced from its formalities then the contract would not be completed
 yadhyapi apane vibhinn roopon main sanvida kaa prachlan samaaj ke vyavsaayik sambandhon main tha parantu "sanvida" shabd kaa anveshan bahut baad main hua
 The word contract is very broad
 sanvida ke hi ang vikray, rin, bandhak, nikshep, saajhedaari, abhikartrutv, vivaah aadi bhi hai
 But in its present form the contract has assumed new legal meaning
 bharatvarsh main iskaa adhinium san 1872 i
 main bana or sanvidaaon kaa niyaman usee bhartiya sanvida adhinium dwaara hota he
 Therefore, Indian courts are now bound to follow this written law in the case of contract
 vyavasthaaon kii vyakhya ke liye unhen isi adhinium kaa adhyayan karke upyukt arth or mantavya nikaalnaa chahie
 The Indian Contract Act is based on the British Contract Act, but the British Contract Act can be availed only if either the Indian Contract Act is silent on a question or its system is unclear and British law is not inconsistent with the Indian condition and social status
 apane vartmaan rup main sanvida ek vidhik vachan yaa kanoon dwaara pravartaneey qaraar he
 It has two essential elements - qaraar or Quality of making it effective by law
 jab kam se kam do vyakti kisi kaary ke karne athwa usase virat rahane ke sambandh main ekamat hote hai to use qaraar kaha jaataa he
 The agreement requires at least two parties
 yadi "a" na "ba" se prastaav kiya ki "ba" "a" kaa ek chitra bana de to vah "ba" ko is kaary hetu paanch sau rupe degaa
 This is proposed by "A"
 yadi "ba" yah sweekaar kar le ki paanch saura rupe main vah "a" ke liye uskaa chitra bana degaa to yah ek aisa qaraar hua jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey he or use prabhavakaari banaaya ja saktaa he
 That is, a person cannot make an agreement alone, it is necessary for the agreement to have the mental unity of the common side on the matters related to the agreement
 taatpary yah he ki qaraar sambandhi prayek baat ke sambandh main ubhay paksh uskaa ek hi arth samajhen
 It should not happen that one side understands one meaning and the other side understands the other meaning
 "a" ke paas do motorcarein hai, ek ford or duusari shevarlyt
 He wants to sell his Ford car for five thousand
 usne apni us car ko bechney kaa prastaav "ba" se kiya
 But "B", considering it a "chevrolet" car, agreed to buy it
 yah qaraar nahin hoga kyonki "a" or "ba" main motorcar ke sambandh main maansik ekaatmakataa nahin hui
 "A" from Motorcar understood Ford Motorcar and "B" as Chevrolet Car
 uparyukt kathan se spasht he ki prastaav hi sweekruti ke uparant qaraar banataa he
 There are different types of proposals but generally they are classified into five categories: 1
 vishisht prastaav, jab koi prastaav nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se kiya jaataa he, tab use vishisht prastaav kehete hai
 Since the offer is made to a certain person or persons, the person accepting it will be called the acceptor
 isamen sweekruti kii soochna swikarta dwaara prastaavak ko dena aavashyak he
 2
 a general proposal is a proposal that is not made by a certain person or persons, but a person of the world can accept it
 isi liye vishisht prastaav kii bhanti isamen sweekruti kii soochna kaa prastaavak ko diya janaa anivaary nahin hota
 Approval of this proposal is considered to be the only thing that is revealed and desired in the proposal
 3
 spasht prastaav ve prastaav he jo maukhik yaa likhit rup main hri parantu spashtat: hri kiye jaaen
 4
 Indicative proposals These proposals are made not by words but by actions
 yatriyon ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan ko tikat ke badale le jane kaa prastaav, railgadee ko stesan par aana hi he
 It is also an example of a general proposition because its acceptor is not predetermined
 5
 anwarat prastaav is prastaav main nishchit dar se 5000 man gehun kii aapurti kaa prastaav
 Even after acceptance of this proposal, one party cannot be compelled to buy whole wheat immediately or the other party will sell it
 prastaav kii hi bhanti or uske anuroop sweekruti kii koi vishesh vidhi yaa pranali nirdhaarit karata he, vahaan sweekruti kaa us vidhi yaa pranali nirdhaarit karata he, vahaan sweekruti kaa us vidhi yaa pranali dwaara sweekruti na ho to prastaavak ko usee pranali dwaara sweekruti dene par bal dena chahie
 But where there is no mention of any system or specific method of acceptance, acceptance can be done by any reasonable, relevant and appropriate system
 sweekruti bhi spasht arthath shabdon dwaara ho sakati he athwa sankethik rup main kaary dwaara
 The acceptance of the company's proposal by work is the seating of the passenger on the train going to the destination with the ticket
 keval maansik sweekruti maatr sweekruti nahin samajhi ja sakati
 Its expression in words or by action is also necessary
 prastaav main nirdisht kaaryon kaa karnaa bhi katipay prastaavon kii sweekruti maani jaati he
 But it is necessary that the acceptor knows the conditions of the proposer before doing this work
 yadi swikarta prastaav kii bina jaankaree ke hi vah kaary karata he jo prastaav main nirdisht he, to vah prastaav kii sweekruti nahin mana ja saktaa
 a person Goridutt sent his bookkeeper Lalman to search for his nephew
 lalman ke jane ke uparant gauridatt ne apane bhattije ko khoj laanevaale ke liye 501 rupe puraskaar kii ghoshnaa kii
 Lalman discovered the nephew of Munim Gauridutt and demanded the award
 nirnay yah hua ki chunki lalman ko ladke kii khoj ke purv puraskaar kii shart kii soochna nahin thi, na puraskaar prapti kii baat hi gyaat thi, at: khoe hue ladke ko khoj laane kaa lalman kaa kaary gauridatt ke prastaav kii sweekruti nahin mana ja saktaa Accepting the profit arising from the proposal is also considered to be acceptance of the offer in appropriate conditions
 varanasi se prayag kii bas main baithkar janaa hi bas maalik ke prastaav kii sweekruti he or swikarta bas kaa kiraaya dene ko baadhya he
 Approval should be in the case of the proposal being upheld
 yadi prastaav nishprabhav ho chukaa he yaa prastaavak dwaara khandit kiya yaa waapas liya ja chukaa he to sweekruti bhi nirarthak or prabhaavaheen hogi
 The information of the proposer is required to be accepted by the acceptor and the acceptance of the offer to the proposer
 prastaav kii soochna jab us vyakti ko praapt ho jaae jiske prati prastaav kiya jaataa he tab prastaav kaa sanvahan yaa sanchaar purna samajha he
 "A" sent the letter "B" in his watch 150) by offering to sell "B"
 jyonhi "k" kaa patr "kha" ko praapt hoga, "k" ke prastaav kaa sanvahan purna ho jayega
 Separation is separate for acceptance
 jab swikarta apni sweekruti prastaavak ke paas is prakaar preshit kar de ki uskaa waapas lenaa swikarta ke vash main na rahe, to prastaavak ke viruddh sweekruti prastaavak ke paas pahunch jaae
 In the above example, convection of your acceptance by "B" will be deemed complete but not against the acceptor
 swikarta ke viruddh sweekruti ke viruddh sweekruti kaa sanvahan tab purna hoga jab swikti prastaavak ke paas pahunch jaae
 In the above example, the acceptance of "B" by the letter "B" will be banned against the proposer named "A" but not against the acceptor "B"
 "kha" ke viruddh sanvahan kii purnataa tab hogi jab uski sweekruti kaa patr "k" ko praapt ho jaae
 When the proposer and the acceptor are present in front of each other, there is no complication in the convection, but when both are in two places, the medium of convection is by post or letter
 uparyukt kathan se yah spasht he ki prastaav kaa patr prastaavak dwaara chode jate hi vah purna nahin hota varan swikarta ke paas pahunchan par hi purna hota he
 This also leads to the conclusion that there is no complication in convection if the offeror and the acceptor are present before each other, but until the acceptor leaves their acceptance letter in the post because then the withdrawal of acceptance is outside the confessor's authority
 goes
 swikarta dwaara sweekrutipatr dak main chhodte har prastaav prastaavak ke viruddh purna ho jaataa he
 It has been said above that acceptance is complete against the acceptor when the proposer receives it
 prastaavak ko praapt hone ke purv swikarta apni sweekrutipatr daakkhaane main chode jate ho swikarta ke viruddh bhi purna ho jaataa he
 Acceptance is also effective if it arrives late or gets lost on the way, as it is believed that inadvertence or mistake of the Department of Posts does not justify any effect on the parties to the contract
 parantu yadi sanvahan ke liye patr dak main na daalkar postman ko de diya jaae to yah paryaapt sanvahan nahin kyonki prayek vyakti ke patr ko lekar dak main chhodana postman ke kartavyon main sammilit nahin he
 According to Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act 1872, all such agreements are considered contracts which qaraar karne yogya pakshon kii Be done with independent consent, jinka pratifal or uddeshy vaid ho or jo The Act should not have been declared by the said Act
 isi dhara main yah bhi spasht kar diya gaya he ki uparyukt paribhaasha kaa prabhaav aise kisi kanoon par nahin padegaa, By which a contract must be written, or with the testimony of registered witnesses
 aise sabhi vyakti sanvida karne yogya maane jate hai jo vyask hon, swasth mastishkvaale hon or kisi kanoon dwaara sanvida karne ke ayogy na tehraae gaye hon
 As a result avyask, Persons with deformed minds or those who are frantic, stupid and drunk, or aise vyakti jo kanoon dwaara sanvida karne ke ayogy tehraae gaye hon, yatha videshi shatru, videshi samrat athwa unke pratinidhi, desh ke shatru, apradhi aadi sanvida nahin kar sakate
 a non-practicing person cannot decide his own profit and loss with independent intelligence
 at: vah sanvida karne yogya nahin mana gaya he
 If the deformity is temporary in the person with deformed heart, or if the deformity is temporary in the person with brain, the brain is deformed and sometimes healthy, then such a person is not in the deformal but is a worthy party to the contract in the time of recovery of the brain
 1 The right of the offender to contract at the time of imprisonment is suspended but for the purpose of imprisonment or forgiveness Shchat her ability to contract is retrieving
 diwalia ghoshit vyakti bhi sanvida karne kii yogyata se vanchit mana jaataa he
 a key requirement of the contract is to have independent consent of the parties to the contract
 yadi sahmati swatantra nahin he to sanvida usase prabhavit hogi
 Consent is considered independent when it 1
 balpravartan yaa traas, 2
 unwanted effects, 3
 chhalkapat, 4
 Has not been influenced or received by a misleading statement, or fallacy
 balpravartan yaa traas kii paribhaasha bhartiya sanvida adhinium kii dhara main di gai he
 According to him, there are four forms of force or tragedy: bhartiya dand vidhaan dwaara varjit or dandaneey kaary karnaa yaa Threatening to do, whether or not the place where this act is done or not, kisi bhi vyakti kii sampatti avaidh rup se roak rakhana; athwa Threatening to stop
 is balpravartan yaa traas kaa uddeshy kisi vyakti ko sanvida kaa paksh bananaa hi hona chahie
 The definition of undue influence is given in Section 16 of the Contracts Act
 uske anusaar vah sanvida avaanchit prabhaav dwaara prerit kahi jaati he jiske pakshon ke sambandh aise hon ki ek paksh duusare paksh kii ichha se apni us vishisht sthiti kaa prayog kare
 The relationship between parents and children, guardians and parents, lawyers and clients, doctors and patients, gurus and disciples, etc
 are similar in that the first party inspires the other's wishes because of their specific relationship
 avaanchit prabhaav siddh karne ke liye yah bhi siddh karnaa aavashyak he ki vastut: vishisht sthitiwale paksh ke duusare paksh par apni vishesh sthiti kaa prayog apane anuchit laabh ke liye kiya
 If this is not proved, a contract will not be deemed to be affected or abandoned by undue influence only because of the specific situation
 yah sanvida adhinium kii dhara 17 main varnit he
 According to him, the following actions shall be called fraud in order to induce the other party or his agent to cheat or trick or join the contract by any party of the contract or by his agent or by his agent: k) kisi asaty baat ko, jisaki satyata main use vishwaas na ho, tathy batalaana, B) to hide a fact which he does not know or believe; ga) aisa vachan dena jise puraa karne kii ichha na ho; D) to do or be dissuaded from an act which the law specifically declares as treachery; ng) dhokhaa dene laayak anya kaary karnaa
 In relation to the agreement, it has been said that there is a need to have a mental consensus between the parties
 bhranti isi se sambandhit dosha he
 In this, one side understands an object or thing and the other side understands the other thing or thing
 falswaroop upree dhang se dekhne main to sanvida kaa nirmaan prathit hota he parantu bhranti ke kaaran vastut: koi sanvida hoti nahin he
 There are many types of these misconceptions
 vishaysaamagree ke sambandh main bhranti kaa udhaaharan purvaprasang main shevarlyt or ford motor kaaron ke dwaara diya gaya he
 Similarly, there is confusion in the identity of the parties to the contract
 "k" ne jise "kha" samajhakar sanvida kii yadi vah vastut: "kha" nahin varan "ga" tha to yah paksh kii pahchaan kii bhranti he
 The nature or meaning of the contract can also be confused
 agar kisi baad kaa ek paksh baad main avasar lene kaa aavedan patr bataakar kisi sandhipatr par duusare paksh kaa hastakshar kara letaa he to duusare paksh ko sanvida ke rup yaa prakruti ke vishay main bhranti hoti he
 In such a case, the signature maker's mind is not with his signature
 prasanvida ke liye pratifal ek aavashyak tatv he
 There can be no covenant without consideration; And even if it is, it is disarmed or illegal
 pratifal bhi vaid hona chahie
 For example "A", "B" are charged Rs 5000 for killing "S"
 And "B" pledge to kill
 yahan yah sanvida ni:satv he kyonki iskaa pratifal hatya kanoon dwaara varjit he
 Thus the following types of returns are invalid - 1
 aise pratifal jo kanoon varjit hai
 If any consideration is explicitly or symbolically forbidden by law, then the covenant made on the basis of it is void
 yah uparyukt udhaaharan se spasht ho jayega
 2
 If there is any consideration which disrupts or nullifies any arrangement of an act, then that consideration shall be deemed to be invalid
 3
 jo pratifal kapatpurna hote hai, ve avaidh samajhe jate hai
 4
 The reward by which a person's body or property is damaged is illegal
 udhaaharan ke liye a ek samachaarpatr ke sampadak ko paanch sau rupaya dene kaa vachan detaa he yadi sampadak ba ke sambandh main apmanjanak vivaran chaape
 The reward here is illegal because it hurts B's reputation
 5
 aise pratifal jo aniatik hote hai, avaidh hai
 6
 Returns against public policy are illegal, such as trading with the enemy
 lokseva ko haani pahunchaane kii pravriti rakhanevaali sanvida, dandaneey aparaadhon se sambandhit mukademon kaa galaa ghotanevaali sanvida ni:satv hoti he
 Contracts tending to misuse statutory action, such a contract is against morality, or a trade contract or someone who is against morality, or a trade contract or a contract to prevent an individual from marrying, etc
 also against public policy And are non-existent
 uddeshy evam pratifal main se ek kaa bhi avaidh hona sanvida ko ni:satv kar detaa he
 If the purpose of the contract is partially invalid, the contract becomes void even if its illegal share can be separated from the valid part
 yadi pratifal yaa uddeshy kaa avaidh ansh vaid ansh se alag kiya ja sake to vaid ansh pravartaneey hoga or avaidh ansh ni:satv hoga
 Eg "B" pledged to give "A" 2000 rupees by a covenant, out of which Rs 1500 was an old loan and Rs 500 was a loss in gambling
 isamen vaid bhaag kaa avaidh bhaag se pruthak kiya ja saktaa he; atev yah pratigyaptr 1500 rupye ke liye maanya hoga kintu 500) ke liye ni:satv hoga
 Contracts declared as disobedience under the Indian Contract Act cannot be enforceable by law, although other elements of the contract must be fully in place

 Then there was no tree plant on the earth and nothing was growing in the fields, because the Lord had not yet sent rain on the earth and there was no one to care for the trees
 parantu koharaa prithvi se uthta tha or jal sari prithvi ko sinchataa tha
 Then Jehovah God lifted the dust from the earth and created man
 yahova ne manushya kii naak main jivan kii saans phunki or manushya ek jivit praani ban gaya
 Then Jehovah God planted a garden in a place formerly called Aden
 yahova parameshwar ne apane banaae manushya ko isi baag main rakhaa
 Jehovah God grew every beautiful tree and all the good trees for food in that garden
 baag ke bich main parameshwar ne jivan ke ped ko rakhaa or us ped ko bhi rakhaa jo achche or bure kii jaankaree detaa he

 Jehovah God commanded the man, "you can eat fruit from any tree in the garden
 lekin tum achche or bure kii jaankaree dene vaale ped kaa fal nahin kha sakate
 If you eat the fruit of that tree you will die
 tab yahova parameshwar ne kaha, “main samajhataa hoon ki manushya kaa akelaa rahanaa thik nahin he
 i will make him a helper that suits him
 ” The Lord made every animal of the earth and every bird of the sky from the soil of the land
 yahova in sabhi jeevon ko manushya ke saamne laayaa or manushya ne har ek kaa naam rakhaa
 Man named all the pets, all the birds of the sky and all the animals in the forest

 tab yahova parameshwar stri ko manushya ke paas laayaa
 Therefore the man will leave his parents and stay with his wife and both of them will become one flesh
 manushya or uski patni baag main nange the, parantu ve lajaate nahin the
 Of all the animals made by Jehovah, the most clever was the snake
 saanp ne kaha, “he stri kya parameshwar ne sach—much tumse kaha he ki tum baag ke kisi ped se fal naa khaanaa?”stri ne kaha, “nahin parameshwar ne yah nahin kaha
 We can eat fruits from garden trees
 lekin ek ped he jiske fal ham log nahin kha sakate
 God told us, 'you cannot eat the fruits of the tree in the middle of the garden, you will not even touch it, otherwise you will die
 ’”lekin saanp ne stri se kaha, “tum marogi nahin
 God knows that if you eat the fruit from that tree, then you will know about good and evil and then you will become like God
 ”stri ne dekha ki ped sundar he
 He saw that the fruit is good to eat and the tree will make him wise
 tab stri ne ped se fal liya or use khaaya
 Her husband was also with her so she gave him some fruits and he ate her
 tab purush or stri donon badal gaye
 His eyes opened and he looked at things differently
 unhone dekha ki unke kapade nahin hai, ve nange hai
 So they took some fig leaves and added them and wore them for themselves instead of clothes
 tab purush or stri ne din ke thande samay main yahova parameshwar ke aane kii aawaaj baag main suni
 They hid among the trees in the garden
 9 yahova parameshwar ne pukaar kar purush se poocha, “tum kahan ho?”purush ne kaha, “maine baag main tere aane kii aawaaj suni or main dar gaya
 i was naked, so hid
 ”yahova parameshwar ne purush se poocha, “tumhen kisne bataaya ki tum nange ho? tum kis kaaran se sharamaae? kya tumne us vishesh ped kaa fal khaaya jise maine tumhen na khaane kii ajna di thi?”purush ne kaha, “tuune jo stri mere liye banaai usne us ped se mujhe fal diya, or maine use khaaya
 "then Jehovah God said to the woman," What did you do? " The woman said, "the snake tricked me
 usne mujhe bevakoof banaaya or maine fal kha liya
 Jehovah God made animals and his wife dress with animal skin
 tab yahova ne ye poshaak unhen di
 Jehovah God said, "look, the man has become like us
" purush achchhai or buraai jaanata he or ab purush jivan ke ped se bhi fal le saktaa he
 If a man eats that fruit, then he will live forever
 ”tab yahova parameshwar ne purush ko adan ke baag chhodane ke liye majaboor kiya

 Purchase is a type of contract developed in the UK
 aajkal china bharat, japan, austrailia or newjiland main iskaa prachlan he
 It is also called closed-leasing
 jab koi kreta kisi sampatti kaa mulya ekamusth dene main asamarth hota he kintu us mulya kaa koi chota bhaag jamaa karne kii kshamta rakhata he us sthiti main kray-abhikray anubandh kaa upyog karke kreta us sampatti ko masik kiraaya ke badale udhaar le saktaa he
 In Canada and the USA it is called the 'installment plan'
 kray-abhikray-anubandh upanidhaan kii shrenee kaa anubandh mana gaya he
 There is no independent method to regulate purchasing
 at: anubandh kii sharton ke alaava sanvida vidhi ke hi niyam us par lagu hote hen
 According to the Bombay High Court, the practice of purchasing and procurement arose in England, and from there these types of contracts were also prevalent in India
 kray-abhikray kaa vidhigat arth he - kisi vastu kaa maalik apni vastu ko ek nishchit kiraye par uthaane ke saath-saath yah bhi vachan detaa he ki ukt vastu ko kiraye par lenevaale vyakti dwaara anubandh kii sharten puri kii jane par maalik us vastu ko bech degaa
 Similar to this, there is another way of buying and selling in which the buyer gets the facility to pay the entire value of the commodity in installments by not paying at the time of the sale
 ise ham vikray karne kaa anubandh kah sakate hai
 Despite the apparent equivalence of these two types of commodity sales, there are four fundamental differences: kray-abhikray ke anubandh main vah vastu kiraye par lenevaale ke supurd turant kar di jaati he
 But it is not necessary to immediately deliver the item to the buyer from the sales contract
 kray-abhikray main vastu ko antat: kharidne yaa na kharidne kaa nirnay us vastu ko kiraye par lenevaale kii ichha par nirbhar hota he
 The question of will does not arise in the sale-contract, because the sale of the item has been edited in it, only the payment of the price continues
 kray-abhikray main yah vastu anubandh main nirdhaarit kalavadhi ke bheetar kisi samay bhi vastu ke maalik ke paas lautaai ja sakati he
 So naturally the responsibility of paying the rent of that item for the same time is on the agent
 vikray anubandh main yah prashn nahin uthta or vikreta sabhi kishton kii rakam vasuulne kaa adhikari hota he kyonki vastu vikray kaary sampadit ho chukaa hota he
 Although in the purchase agent, the item is handed over to the agent, the ownership of the item remains in the owner of the item until the agent reveals the decision to purchase the item
 lekin vikray anubandh main yadhyapi mulya kii adaayagi kishton main chalati rahati he tathaapi vikray kii hui vastu kaa swaamitv kreta main nihit ho chukaa hota he
 The effect of this difference is that in the sales contract, if the seller does not transfer the item to the buyer, the buyer can claim for the transfer of the item and if the buyer does not pay the installments, the seller can claim the value
 kintu abhikray main yadi kiraye kii kistein adaa nahin kii jaatin to vastu kaa maalik us vastu kii vaapasi or us samay tak ke kiraye kaa daawa kar saktaa he
 Normally, only two sides are required for purchase and purchase of the owner and agent of the object
 kintu is prakaar ke vyapaarik vinimay ke vistaar ke saath-saath vittiya sahaayak sanghathanon kaa bhi udai hua he jo ukt donon pakshon se sampark sthapit kar vastu ke maalik kaa sthaan uplabdh kar lete hai
 These types of commodity sales differ in the rights and responsibilities of the parties concerned, so the decision of the question of whether an agreement is a contract or a sale contract depends only on the economic analysis of the terms of that agreement
 samjhaute kii sharton main vikray yaa abhikray utana mahatvapurn nahin he jitna yah dekhnaa ki donon pakshon kii asli manshaa kya he
 If there is no weight on the recipient of the item and it is left to his desire to become or not become the owner of the item, he will be treated as an agent despite the use of words like purchase, sale, installment etc
 kray-abhikray chunki anubandhsanvida kaa hi ek prakaar he at: naaballig vishyak sanvidavidhi ke niyam is par bhi lagu hote hai
 It is also noteworthy that purchasing agent can be used not only for movable property, but also for immovable property

 aupchaarik shiksha ke kshetra main paathyacharya yaa paathyakram vidhyalay yaa vishvavidhyalay main pradaan kiye jane vaale paathyakramon or unki saamagree ko kehete hai
 The course is instructional and is based on the more general syllabus which only specifies which level of understanding is required to achieve a specific grade or standard
 1918 main is vishay par prakashit pratham pustak da karikulam main jon franklin baubit ne kaha ki ek vichaar ke rup main paathyakram kii jaden res-course ke liye latin shabd main he or paathyakram kaa varnan aise kaaryon evam anubhavon ke rup main kiya he jinke madhyam se bachche apekshit vayask ke rup main viksit hote hai taaki vayask samaaj main safalataa praapt kii ja sake
 In addition, the curriculum includes not only the experiences in the school but also the constitutional work and experiences in the school and beyond; Experiences that have been unplanned and unspecified, and experiences that have been deliberately directed towards the purposeful formation of adult members of society
 baubit ke liye paathyakram ek saamaajik ejineering kaa kshetra he
 According to their cultural projections and social definitions, there are two notable characteristics of their curriculum construction: Scientific experts based on their special knowledge about what qualities adult members of society should have and what experiences will produce such qualities, they can create courses
 And the course is defined as work experiences that are The student must possess the required adult to become an adult
 isliye, unhone paathyakram ko logon ke charitra kaa nirmaan karne vaale kaaryon evam anubhavon kii thos vaastaviktaa ke sthaan par ek adarsh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 Contemporary notions of curriculum reject these elements of the bobbit, but maintain the premise that the curriculum is a period of experiences that make humans human
 paathyakramon ke madhyam se vaiyaktik gathan kaa vyaktigat or samuhik str par adhyayan kiya jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye peshewar gathan, aitihaasik anubhav ke madhyam se shaikshik anushaasan)
 ek samooh kaa gathan uske vyaktigat pratibhaagiyon ke gathan ke saath hi hota he
 Although it has formally appeared in Bobbitt's definition, the discussion of the curriculum as a form of creative experience can also be seen in John Dewey's work
 Although Bobbitt and Dewey's idealistic understanding of the term "curriculum" differs from current restricted uses of the term, course authors and researchers generally view it as a uniform factual understanding of the curriculum
 aupchaarik shiksha yaa schuli shiksha main ek paathyakram, kisi vidhyalay yaa vishvavidhyalay main pradaan kiye jane vaale paathyakramon, paathyakram sambandhi kaaryon or unki saamagree ko kehete hai
 a syllabus can be prescribed partially or completely by an external, official institution

 For example, the National Council of Mathematics Teachers for Mathematics Education
 The Education Department of every state in Australia establishes a curriculum in 2011 with plans for a national curriculum
 unesco ke antarrashtriya shiksha beuro kaa praathmik mishan he, duniya bhar main paathyakramon kaa adhyayan karnaa or unke kriyanvayan par najar rakhana
 The curriculum has two meanings: courses from which students choose the subject of their choice and a specific education program
 In the latter case the syllabus collectively describes the learning, knowledge and available assessment material of the given course for study
 vartmaan main, ek sarpil paathyakram ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he jiske madhyam se chaatr adhyayan kiye ja rahe vishyon kii saamagree ko vikaas ke vibhinn staron par aank sakenge
 The constructivist approach to the Tycoil curriculum proposes that children learn best through active involvement with the educational environment, that is, learning by discovery
 The curriculum is important for course objectives that are typically represented as learning outcomes
 And usually include the program's evaluation strategy
 These results and assessments are classified as units and therefore the syllabus is a collection of units where each unit consists of specific and definite parts of the syllabus
 to ek saamaanya paathyakram main sanchaar, sankhyatmak kaary, soochna praudyogiki or saamaajik kaushal kii ikaiyaan shaamil hoti hai or prayek ke liye vishisht shikshan pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Many educational institutions are currently trying to balance the two conflicting forces
 ek ore kuch kaa maananaa he ki sabhi chaatro ke gyaan kii neenv ko ek samaan hona chahie, samaan prakaar ke paathyakram ke rup main; vahin duusari ore anya chaahate hai ki chaatro ke paas apni pasandida shiksha prapti kaa adhikaar hona chahie, iske liye ve shuruyaat main hi kisi vishay main visheshgyata praapt karne kii koshish kar sakate hai yaa apni pasand ke hisaab se apane vishyon ko chun sakate hai
 This tension has been the subject of much discussion as Harvard University restructured its core requirements
 prayek course kii purv-aavashyaktaaon kii pahchaan, paathyakram dizin kii ek anivaary visheshta he jise har college suchi evam vidyalayan shiksha ke har str par dekha ja saktaa he
 These requirements can be met by specialized courses and in some cases by examination or work experience
 saamanytah kisi bhi vishay main adhik unnat paathyakramon ke liye kuch buniyadi paathyakramon kii neenv kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, lekin kuch corcej main anya vibhaagon main adhyayan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jaise ki bhautikee main visheshgyata praapt karne ke liye ganit kii kuch kakshaen aavashyak hai yaa sahitya, sangeet athwa vaigyanik shodh ke chaatro ke liye bhashaa praveenta kii aavashyaktaa
 ek adhik vistrut paathyakram ko banaate samay kisi paathyakram ke bheetar rakhe gaye prayek vishay kii purv-aavashyaktaaon kaa avashya dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie
 Once mutual dependencies between disciplines are known, problems of course arrangement and duration begin to arise
 shikshan main ek mukhya paathyakram, ek paathyakram athwa adhyayan kaa course hota he jisaki bhoomika ko kendriya mana jaataa he tathaa jise aamtaur par ek skool yaa skool paddati ke sabhi chaatro ke liye anivaary rup se lagu kiya jaataa he
 However, this is not always the case
 udhaaharan ke liye, koi skool sangeet sambandhi kaksha ko anivaary kar saktaa he lekin yadi chaatr yadi arcestra, band, kores ityadi jaisi kisi pradarshan sambandhi sangeet main bhaag lete hai to ve isse baahar rahane kaa chunaav kar sakate hai
 The major curriculum is often established at the primary and secondary levels by school boards, education departments or other administrative institutions looking after the work of education
 sanyukt rajya america main "kaaman kor state standard inishiative " rajyon ko ek pramukh paathyakram apnaane or uskaa vistaar karne ke liye protsaahit karti he
 The objective of this coordination is to promote greater use of similar textbooks in the states and more equality in the attainment of minimum level of education
 2009-10 main rajyon ko in maanakon ko apnaane ke liye protsaahan ke rup main sangh ke 'res tu di top' kaarykram se dhan muhaiyaa karwaane kii sambhaavn kaa aashwaasan diya gaya
 Many college and university administration and faculty sometimes make core courses compulsory at the undergraduate level, especially in the liberal arts
 Due to the depth and greater specialization of the major subjects that students are studying, a common core curriculum of higher education prescribes a much smaller amount of student work than a high school or elementary school
 america ke pramukh collejon ke pramukh paathyakram kaaryakramon main se sarvaadhik prasiddh evam vistrut kaaryakramon main, colombia vishvavidhyalay ke colombia college tathaa chicago vishvavidhyalay kaa naam aata he
 It can take up to two years to complete both without any advanced specialization and they are designed to develop important skills in a variety of academic disciplines, such as: social sciences, humanities, physical and biological sciences, Mathematics, writing and foreign languages
 1999 main chicago vishvavidhyalay ne apane kor paathyakram kii saamagree ko ghataane or sanshodhit karne kii yojana kii ghoshnaa kii, jisame shaamil tha aavashyak paathyakramon kii sankhya 21 se ghataakar 15 karnaa or vishyon kii ek or adhik vyapak shrinkhalaa ko pradaan karnaa
 When the New York Times, The Economist and other major news characters began printing about this story, it became a focal point of national debate on university education
 da neshnal association of scolers ne ek bayaan jari karte hue kaha ki, "chicago vishvavidhyalay dwaara apane behtareen snaatak kor paathyakram kaa yah parityag vaaki kaaphi niraashajanak he, jo ek lambey samay tak america shaikshanik sanstha ke bich ek maanak ke rup main sthapit rahaa he
 "however, university administrators like Chairman Hugo Sonnenshin also argued that downsizing the core curriculum had become financially and academically mandatory as the university was finding it difficult to attract the appropriate number of applicants to its undergraduate department This was because its very elaborate core curriculum was not being liked by "an average 18-year-old"
 iske alaava jaise-jaise beesvin sadi main kai america skulon ke kor paathyakram main kami aane lagi, kai choti sansthaaen aise kor paathyakram ko apnaane ke liye prasiddh ho gayin jinamein chaatr kii lagbhag puri snaatak shiksha ko samahit kiya jaataa tha or vigyaan sahit sabhi vishyon ko padhaane ke liye aksar paaramparik pashchimi siddhanton ke paath kaa upyog bhi kiya jaataa tha
 St
 John's College in the United States is an example of this approach
 koncordia vishvavidhyalay, irvin ne bhi 2010 se ek aisa hi paaramparik kor paathyakram lagu kiya he
 Some colleges try to strike a balance between specified and unspecified curriculum using a system of delivery requirements
 aisi pranali main chaatro ko vishesh shreniyon main course lenaa aavashyak hota he lekin ve in shreniyon ke bheetar apni pasand se chunaav kar sakate hai
 Other institutions have almost completely eliminated these curriculum-related requirements, for example, courses at Brown University and Cornell University are entirely in the hands of the student
 amherst college main chaatr ko pratham-varsh seminaron kii suchi main se kisi ek ko chunanaa hota he lekin iske liye kisi kaksha athwa vitaran kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he

 da mapats, gym hension dwaara banaaya gaya kathputli paatro kaa ek samooh he jisaki shuruyaat 1954-55 main hui thi
 Individually, this puppet is made by Jim Henson or his company's workshop
 haalanki is shabd kaa prayog praayah kisi bhi us kathputli ke liye kiya jaataa he jo da mopet sho kii vishisht style se mail karti ho, yah shabd ek anaupchaarik naam or henson dwaara rache gaye paatro ke saath judaa ek vyavsaayik trademark donon hi he
 The term "muppet" first came to light in 1956 and was used by Henson combining the words "marionette" and "puppet"
 haalanki, henson ke dwaara yah bhi sunne main aayaa tha ki unhen bas is shabd kii dhwani sunne main bahut acchhee lagi thi or unhone "marionet / papet" kii yah kahani basii yun hi kisi patrkaar se baatcheet ke dauraan hi bana lee thi kyonki yah sunne main satya prathit ho rahi thi
 The Muppets were purchased by The Walt Disney Company in 2004, after initial unsuccessful attempts
 iske apwaadon main sismi street main dikhne vaale paatr or fragal rock ke fragles the 
 "mopet" shabd kaa kanoonee trademark vartmaan main da mapats holding company, da walt digni company kaa ek prabhag) ke paas he; haalanki sismi workshop or da gym henson company kuch nishchit adhikaron ke saath is shabd kaa prayog apane paatro ke liye ab bhi kar rahe hai
 More than 10 years later, work on a new film is in progress
 digni ne haal hi main jesan sigel or nicholas stoler ko studio ke liye agali mopet film banane ke liye apni company main shaamil kiya he
 This will be the first theater film for puppets since Muppets from Space
 In January 2010, James Bobbin signed on to direct the film
 da mapats ke naveenatam television special, a Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa, kaa pratham pradarshan 17 disambar 2008 ko enbisi par kiya gaya tha
 It was released on DVD on 29 September 2009
 da mapats ko dikhaane vaale ek hellovien television special ko oktober 2010 main abisi par dikhaae jane kaa yojana thi, lekin baad main pataa chalaa ki ek aagaamee film kii vajah se ise sthagit kar diya gaya
 The design commonly seen in Jim Henson's puppets has a wide mouth and large and bulging eyes
 ye kathputliyaan aksar vibhinn prakaar ke fom se banaayin jaati hai, jiske baad inhen oon, fer yaa kisi anya chiz se bane vastra pahanaaye jate hai
 Puppets can express humans, animal animals, real animals, robots, human objects, creatures from other planets, mythological characters or other undefined, neo-fictional creatures, monsters, or abstract characters
 mapats ko vibhinn awaajen nikaalane vaali "damiz" / "kathputliyon" se alag rakhaa jaataa he, kyonki aisi kathputliyon main keval sar or chehre ko sajiv dikhaaya jaataa he, mapats ke sambandh main unke haath or anya bhaag bhi gatisheel hote hai or abhivyakti main sahaayta karte hai
 Ideally the Muppets are made of soft material
 inamen kathputli kaa khel dikhne vaale kii bhi aavashyaktaa nahin hoti, jo vaise bhi aamtaur par darshakon ko dikhaayi nahin padataa-vah manch ke peeche yaa camere kii seemaa se baahar hota he
 a new trend was to use the camera range as a "platform" in the Muppets
 purv main television par, ek sajiv prasaaran kii tarah hi kathputliyon ke khel main bhi kalakaaron ko chhipaata hua ek manch banaaya jaataa tha
 Sometimes their entire body is also visible
 yah paatro ke sharir or munh ko gati dene ke liye prayog kiye jane vaale adrishy dhaage kii sahaayta se kiya jaataa he or iske baad inhen awaz di jaati he
 According to author Michael David, puppets develop "organically", that is, puppeteers take time to set up, sometimes up to a year, and in the meantime they slowly push themselves Develop characters and their voices
 jaisaa david ne kaha, kathputliyaan bhi "pareekshan-aadhaarit" hoti hai inhen henson kii mandali ke ek sadsy se duosre sadsy tak is aashaa main ghoomte rahanaa padataa he ki inhen main se use iskaa sarvottam manushya-kathputli saathi milegaa 
 In spite of seeing people who make puppets, children behave as if these puppets are alive while interacting with these puppets
 kathputli ko chalaane vaale hameshaa inhen sar ke upar yaa sharir ke saamne rakhte hai is dauraan unka ek haath in kathputliyon ke sar or munh kaa sanchaalan karata he or doosraa haath or bhujaaon ko ghumata he, isaki khatir ve do alag-alag niyantran dand lete hai yaa phir haath jaise dastaane pahante hai
 The result of this design is that most puppets use the left hand prominently as their handlers use their right hand to drive their head and their hand penalties with their left hand
 inaki or bhi anek digine or chalaane ke madhyam prachlit hai
 In the developed puppets, several handlers operate the same character, the only person acting on the gesture of the mouth is usually the voice of the character
 takanic ke vikaas ke saath hi, gym henson kaa dal or anya kathputli sanchalankarta bhi film or television hetu in kathputliyon ko chalaane ke liye vibhinn madhyam viksit kar chuke hai, jisamen latakane vaale upkaran, aatanrik motor, remote radio niyantran or computer dwaara parishkrut bahustareey chitra shaamil hai
 With the creative use of a mixture of techniques, it has become possible for puppets to show scenes such as cycling, rowing, and even dancing on stage without a visual handler
 da mopet sho kii prasiddh kathputliyaan or inke anek upapatro main, karmit da frog, miss pigi, fauzi bear, rijo da rat, gonjo da great, rolf da dog, doctor bansen hanidyu or bikar, scooter, statler and waldorf, da swedish shef, sam da eagle, switems, pepe da king praun, robin da frog or doctor tith and da electric mehem naamak ek band shaamil hai, jiske sadasyon main doctor tith, jainis, jute, floyad paper or animal hai
 Other famous puppets include characters from the Sesame Street, such as Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, Elmo, Joe, Burt and Ernie, Cookie Monster, Grover, Abby Cuddaby and Count Von Count, as well as the main character Fraggle Rock

 apni yojanake shuruaati charan se hi sismi street ko ek aise kaarykram ke rup main taiyaar kiya gaya tha jisamen sangeet or geet sikhaaye jane vaale sandesh kaa ek bhaag hongen

 swami somdev arya samaaj ke ek vidwaan dharmopadeshak the
 Born in Lahore city of Punjab province during the British Raj, Somdev's real name was Brajlal Chopra
 san 1915 main jin dinon ve swasthya laabh ke liye arya samaaj shahjahanpur aaye the unheen dinon samaaj kii ore se ram prasad 'bismil' ko unki seva-sushrusha main niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Child Ramprasad later became unmatched revolutionary like 'bismil' after getting the satsangi of Swami Somdev in his teens
 ramprasad bismil ne apni aatmakatha main mere gurudev sheershak se unki sankshipt kintu sargarbhit jeevani likhi he
 Somdev ji was not only a speaker of high quality, but also a very good writer
 unke likhe hue kuch lekh tathaa pustaken unke hi ek bhakt ke paas thim jo uski laaparvaahee se nasht ho gayin
 Some of his articles were also published
 lagbhag 57 varsh kii aayu main unka nidhan hua
 Swami Somdev's real name was Brajlal Chopra
 punjab praant ke lahore shahar main janme brajalaal ke dada maharaja ranjit singh ke mantrimandal main rahe the
 Shortly after birth, the grandmother raised him due to his mother's death
 mata-pita kii iklauti santaan brajalaal ko unki chaachiyon ne jehar dekar maarane kii kai baar koshish kii taaki unke ladakon ko sampatti mil jaye
 But due to uncle's affection, he was educated in English school along with his cousins
 balak brajalaal ke hriday main dayaa-bhav bahut adhik tha
 For this reason, he often gave his books and new clothes to poor classmates and went to school wearing the old ones himself
 unke chachaa ko jab yah maaloom hua ki brajalaal naye kapade nirdhan vidhyaarthiyon ko baant detaa he to unhone brajalaal se kaha ki jab uske man main kapade baantne kii ichha hua kare to unhen bataa de
 They will get new clothes made
 kam se kam apane kapade to unhen na baante
 Not only this, many poor students used to call their homes and also provide them food
 unki is udaartaa ke kaaran chaachiyon tathaa chachere bhaiyon ko bada ksht hota tha
 Finally, Brijlal did not marry and left his home one night after getting fed up with the daily routine
 bahut dinon tak idhar-udhar bhatakane ke baad brajalaal haridwar pahunche
 He met a Siddha yogi there
 balak ko jis vastu kii ichha thi, vah use mil gayi thi
 Now that child had become Somdev from Brajlal
 guru ke ashram main rahakar unhone yoga-vidya kii purna shiksha praapt kar lee
 With the grace of Yogiraj Guru, he practiced to establish a tomb of 15 to 20 hours
 kai varsh tak swami somdev haridwar main rahe
 Through yoga practice, they used to lighten their body weight so much that they used to go on the earth like water
 bharat-bhraman kii ichha jaagrit hote hi unhone ek din haridwar tyaag diya or anek sthanon par gum-gum kar deshaatan, adhyayan va manan karte rahe
 Having ordered many books in relation to scriptures from Germany and America, he studied them seriously
 jin dinon lala lajpat raay ko desh-nirvaasan kii sajaa di gayi somdev un dinon lahore main hi the
 He applied with a desire to get a newspaper from there
 lahore kaa dipti kamishnar us samay kisi bhi naye akhbaar kaa aavedan sweekaar hi na karata tha parantu jab swami somdev se bhent hui to vah unke vyaktitv se prabhavit hua or usne aavedan sweekaar kar liya
 He wrote the first editorial of his newspaper as a warning to the British
 lekh itnaa uttejnapurna tha ki thodi der main hi akhbaar kii sabhi pratiyaan haathon-haath bik gayin or janata ke anurodh par usee ank kaa doosraa sanskaran prakashit karnaa padaa
 As soon as the report was presented to the deputy commissioner, he called Somdev in his office
 vah lekh ko padhakar krodh se kaanpata or mej par mukka martha
 But after reading the last sentences of the article, i would become silent
 us lekh ke ant main somdev ne likhaa tha - "yadi angrej ab bhi na samajhe to vah din dur nahin ki san 1857 ke drishy hindustan main phir dikhaai den or angrejon ke bacchon ko katl kiya jaay va unki striyon kii beijjati ho
 But this is all dream, it is all dream
 " inhen shabdon ko padhakar dipti kamishnar kahata - "swami somdev! tum nihit hoshiyaar ho
 We can't do anything
 " He reached Bombay while touring India
 unke vyaakhyaan sunakar janata bahut prabhavit hui
 The elder brother of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad was so fascinated to hear his lecture that he took him to his home
 dharmik kathaon kaa paath karne janaa chhod vah din raat somdev ke hi paas baithe rahete
 When he was asked to go somewhere, he would cry and say that i am overwhelmed by your spiritual knowledge
 mujhe ab kisi bhi sansaarik vastu kii koi ichha hi nahin rahi
 Azad's elder brothers were also very good religious narrators and had thousands of disciples
 unke shishyon ko is baat par bada krodh aayaa ki unke islamic dharmaguru somdev naam ke ek kafir ke chakkar main fas gayi hai
 Therefore all the disciples gathered and came to the house to kill Swamiji
 unhone swamiji ke praanon par sankat aayaa dekh unase bombay chhod dene kii prarthana kii
 Abul Kalam Azad's brother Sahab was so sad that he committed suicide as soon as Swamiji left Bombay

 It was because of his extraordinary merit that he was elected the representative of the All India Congress
 agra kii aryamitra-sabha ke varshikotsav par unka vyaakhyaan sunakar raja mahendrapatap atyadhik prabhavit hue or unhen apana guru maan liya
 He was a fearless speaker
 ram prasad bismil ne unhen san 1913 main pehali baar shahjahanpur main suna tha
 In those days, he resided in Bareilly and from there he went to give lectures at Shahjahanpur
 somdev kaa sharir kaaphi dublaa-patala tha kintu unki vaani bahut buland va itani spashth thi ki bina mike ke bolne par bhi teen-chaar furlongs kii duuri se bilkul saaf sunaayi detii thi
 He had a strange disease
 jab kabhi shouch jate, kabhi do chhataank, kabhi chaar chhataank or kabhi kabhi to ek ser tak khun gir jaataa tha
 They did not have piles, but they used to say that due to the deterioration of yoga activity, the intestine was rotted
 atev chikitsakon ne unka pet chirakar aant kaat di thi
 Since then, he had a terrible disease of blood from the anus
 bade-bade vaidyon va doctoron se ilaaj bhi karaayaa parantu koi phayda nahin hua
 In 1915, some people requested him that the most difficult diseases in the climate of Shahjahanpur are eradicated
 tabhi se ve aryasamaj mandir shahjahanpur main hi nivas karne lage
 Bismil devoted much of his time to her service - Sushrusha
 jin dinon balak ramprasad unki seva main niyukt tha ve use dharmik tathaa rajnatik upadesh ke saath-saath vibhinn prakaar kii pustaken bhi padhane ko diya karte the
 In the field of politics too, he had high quality information
 na keval desh apitu videsh main pravaas karne vaale krantikari chintak lala hardayal tak unase paraamarsh liya karte the
 He once saved Mahatma Munshiram, later known as Swami Shraddhanand, from the wrath of the police
 acharya ramdev va shyaamaji krishna verma se bhi unka bada gaharaa sambandh tha
 After passing the entrance, he used to talk to Bismil about traveling to Europe and visiting Italy to visit the birthplace of Mahatma Mejini
 san 1916 main jab lahore shadyantr kaa mukadmaa chalaa main or bhai parmanand kii phaansi kii sajaa kaa samachar chapa to use padhakar bismil ke tan vadan main aag lag gayi
 He vowed that he would avenge it
 pratigya karne ke pashchaat bismil swami somdev ke paas gayi or unhen apni pratigya ke bare main bataaya
 On this, he told Bismil that it is easy to pledge but it is very difficult to maintain it
 ramprasad bismil ne swamiji ko pranaam kar kaha ki yadi unke shricharanon kii krupa bani rahi to pratigya purti main kisi prakaar kii kotahi nahin hogi
 From that day on, Swami Somdev started telling a lot of politics related things to the boy Bismil
 bakaul bismil usee din se ramprasad ke man main krantikari banane kii tamanna jaagrit hui or vah ram prasad se ramprasad bismil ho gaya
 Apart from the principles of Somdev arya-samaj, Ramakrishna Paramahansa, Swami Vivekananda, Swami Ramatirtha and Mahatma Kabirdas used to tell Bismil a lot about the teachings
 swami somdev ke sadupadeshon ke parinamswaroop hi bismil main brahmacharya-paalan kii utkantha or dharmik tathaa atmik jivan main dridhtaa utpann hui
 Whatever things he said about Bismil's future life, he proved to be absolutely true
 somdev ji bismil se aksar kaha karte the ki unhen is baat kaa dukh he ki unka sharir ab adhik dinon tak rahane vaala nahin he jabaki ramprasad kaa jivan abhi kaaphi barason tak rahegaa
 In such a situation, it is possible that strange problems may arise in his life
 parantu unhen sulajhane vaala koi na hoga
 Yes, one thing is certain that if his body is not destroyed, although it is not possible to happen, then Bismil's life would be an ideal life in the whole world
 bismil ne apni aatmakatha main is baat kaa ullekh kiya he ki yah unka durbhaagya hi kaha jaayegaa ki jab swami somdev kaa antim samay nikat aayaa unhone yogabhyas sambandhi kuch kriyaayein bataane kii ichha prakat kii, kintu bhayankar durbalata ke kaaran ve kabhi is yogya na ho sake ki kuch der baith kar kuch yogic kriyaayein bismil ko bataa pate
 He also told Bismil that even though his yoga got confused, he would try to tell where the next birth would take
 unhone marate samay paas rahane kii baat bhi bismil se kii thi, kintu vah bhi sambhav na ho sakaa! Swami Somdev was as much a speechless writer as he was a unique speaker
 unke likhe hue kuch lekh tathaa pustaken unke ek bhakt ke paas thim jo yon hi nasht ho gayin
 Somdev died at the age of 57
 barbar bhashaayen uttar africa ke barbar logon kii mul bhashaayen hai
 From a linguistic perspective, they are considered to be members of the afro-asian or Semitic language family
 barbar bhashaaon ke chah pramukh shakhaayen hai - Those who speak the barbaric language of one branch do not fully understand the dialect of any other branch because the words and accents in these branches are different
 barbari kii apni "tifinag" naam kii pracheen aksharmala he jisaki sabase puraani likhaai 200 ipu se mili he
 After the Arabic invasion and occupation of barbaric areas, its use almost ceased, although it continued to be used by the Tuarag-speakers living in the deep desert
 bahut se barbar log barbari chhodkar arabi bolne lage or jo barbari likhte-bolte bhi the unamem arabi varnmaala kaa istemaal aam ho gaya
 Apart from the Tuarg areas, the use of Arabic characters in barbaric areas was prevalent from 1000 AD to 1500 AD
 19ve or 20ve sadi main europian samavaad ke saath -saath barbari kaa roman lipi main likhnaa shuru ho gaya
 This "barbaric Latin alphabet" became widely used in Morocco and Algeria, especially for writing tribal barbarians
 2003 main morocco ne, barbar swabhimaan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, aupchaarik rup se tifinag lipi ke ek aadhunik rup ko sarkari manyata de di lekin abhi bhi kabaili barbar lekhak barbar latin lipi kaa hi zyaada prayog karte hai

 angrezi main sangyaaon kaa ling nahin hota, jabaki hindi main sangyaayen streeling yaa pulling hoti hai 
 Berbari is like Hindi in this case
 pulling sangyaayen 'a / aa', 'u / uu' yaa 'i / i' se shuru hoti hai - There are three methods to make a noun plural - which method is used depends on the noun
 tulana ke liye, hindi main bhi teen tareeqen hai - 'juuta' kaa bahuvachan 'juute', 'makkhi' kaa 'makkhiyaan' or 'fal' kaa 'fal' hi hota he
 The 'normal method' is applied to some nouns of Berbri in which the first vowel of the word is changed to 'n' at the end - kuch sangyaaon par 'tuuti vidhi' lagu hoti he jisamen bahuvachan banane ke liye keval ekvachan shabd ke swaron main pher-badal kiya jaataa he - The third method is the mixed method, which is a mixture of the first two methods - kisi sangya kaa streeling banane ke liye ekvachan main uske pulling rup ke ird-gird 't' laga diya jaataa he or bahuvachan main keval uske shuru main hi 't' laga diya jaataa he - Note that the pronunciation of the letter 'G' used in the words "taimizigt", "tiffinag" and many other Berberies is different from "c"
 yah 'ghazal' ke 'ga' jaisaa he 
 Similarly, the pronunciation of 'kh' is also different from 'kh'
