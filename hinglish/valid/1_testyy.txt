 Removal divers are trained to remove tunnels laid in shallow waters such as ports, docks and internal waterways
 vayuyan or helicopter bhi kuch madad karte hai, lekin hataane or safai kaa kaary mukhyat: surang todane vaale poton dwaara, jinhen 'surang todak' kehete hai, hi hota he
 Detection of tunnels is also a simple task
 yah kaary pehle sainik karte the, lekin aajkal kuch aisi yuktiyaan bani hai jinase surang kii upasthiti kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 One of these methods is called 'magnetic detector'
 aise ek upkaran main 'year phone' laga rahata he, jisase surang ke upar chalate hue sipaahi ke kaanon main gunjan sunai detaa he
 These are called 'electromagnetic detectors'
 ab adhaatuon kii bhi surangen banane lagi hai
 One way of breaking the tunnel was to create an explosion in the area of the tunnel, causing the tunnel to explode and destroy
 ise 'pratyupaayi surang lagaana' kehete hai
 There are a specific type of vessel
 in poton main lagbhag 900 foot lambey taar ke rasse lage rahete hai
 These towing are attached to one side of the vessel
 inhen 'todan gear' kehete hai
 These towing are kept away from the ship with the help of water buoyancy, called 'paraven'
 paraven duubakar pende main na chalaa jaae iske liye unamem dhaatu kaa utplavak laga rahata he
 Breaking gears grab the wires connecting the tunnels to their submersible and cut them with the help of the teeth attached to them
 in taron ke cat jane se surang pani par tairne lagati he or ise rifl fire dwaara nasht kar dete hai
 These ships are specially built to remove magnetic or acoustic tunnels
 chumbakeey surangtodak pot ke pichley hisse se ek taar kaa rassa judaa rahata he
 The entire vessel is without magnetic properties
 in rasson main vidyutdhara pravaahit kar chumbakeey gun utpann kiya jaataa he
 Due to this the magnetic tunnels explode and destroy after the ship overtakes them
 dhvanik surang todak pot main derick se ek dhvanik chappu laga rahata he, jo ucch tivrata vaali dhwani utpann karata he
 Due to this, the tunnel is destroyed and destroyed before the ship reaches that place

 The role of the Natas was redefined by the US in the post-cold War era
 iske tahat kaha gaya ki sampoorn europe ke kshetron main yah parsparik sahyog or sambandhon ke vikaas kaa madhyam he
 Not only this, he also tried to legitimize the role of dramas in the development and propagation of democratic values and ideals

 The role and extent of post-cold War plays can be seen under the following points- nato apane is vistaar se main europe main ek pramukh pratinidhi ke rup main ubhara
 NATO represents the integration of the whole of Europe in the post-cold War period, which represented the integration of Western Europe during the Cold War period
 nato ke vistaar ke paksh main jo sakaraatmak bate kahi gai iske baavjood uski aalochana bhi kii jaati he
 In fact, nato's role violates the role of the United Nations in relation to peacekeeping, mutual cooperation, etc

 main hua
 Andersen observed that by applying magnetic fields in the Wilson cell, taking photos of space rays, two paths, such as electrons, often have their curvature in opposite directions
 vakrata kan ke aavesh par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore it is clear from these experiments that the charge of these particles will be inverted
 ab pozitron kaa astitv anya pareekshanon se bhi sthapit ho chukaa he
 Four years before Positron's experimental invention, Dirac gave an equation that described all the known properties of the electron, but it was also necessary to assume a particle whose covariance and energy were negative
 yah baat ajeeb thi
 To avoid this undesirable situation, Dirac proposed that generally all states of negative energy are filled with electrons
 at: ham dhanatmak urja kii avasthaaon ko hi dekh pate hai
 But sometimes when strong, interactions occur by the electromagnetic field, an electron comes out of the states of negative energy and comes out and behaves like a positive energy electron
 par saath hi rin urjawali ek avasthaa khaali ho jaati he
 We can illustrate this with a hole in a sea of negative energy
 yah chhidr aise hi aacharan karata he jaise dhan aveshwala kan, jisaki sanhati electron ke baraabar ho
 At first Dirac tried to consider this particle to be a proton, but when Andersen's result was discovered, he considered the particle not a proton, but a positron
 dirack kaa chhidr siddhant bahut santoshjanak nahin he
 The modern theory of electrons and positrons relies on the second quantization of the Dirac equation
 isamen pozitron ke gundharm prakritik vidhi se nikal aate hai
 Electrons and positrons can be called 'particles' and 'antimatter'

 There is a great difference in the resistivity of soil at different places, due to which moisture, heat, and chemical composition of the soil are the main reason
 mrudaa pratirohakata ke saamaanya maan ye hai- The Wenner four-pin method, as shown in figure above, is the most commonly used technique for soil resistivity measurements
using the Wenner method, the apparent soil resistivity value is: where ρe = measured apparent soil resistivity a = electrode spacing b = depth of the electrodes RW = Wenner resistance measured as "V / I" in Figure If b is small compared to a, as is the case of probes penetrating the ground only for a short distance, the previous equation can be reduced to: In the Schlumberger method the distance between the voltages probe is a and the distances from voltages probe and currents probe are c
 Using the Schlumberger method, if b is small compared to a and c, and c>2a, the apparent soil resistivity value is: where ρe = measured apparent soil resistivity a = electrode spacing b = depth of the electrodes c = electrode spacing RS = Schlumberger resistance measured as "V / I" in Figure Rai Bareilly Express 4208 is a mail express train operated by Indian Railways

 Sant Kanwar Ram was the great Karmayogi, Tyagi, ascetic and Sufi saint of Sindh
 sant kanvar raamji kaa janm 13 april san 1885 isvi ko baisakhi ke din sindh praant main sakkhar jile ke mirpur mathelo tehsil ke jarwar gram main hua tha
 Both his father Tarachand and mother Tirtha Bai used to lead their lives with satisfaction and simplicity by performing Lord Bhakti and Hari Kirtan
 udarpurti ke liye tarachand ek choti si dukaan chalaate the
 There was a lack of children in his life
 sindh ke param sant khotram sahib ke yahaan mata tirth bai hriday bhav se seva karti thim
 With the blessings of the saint, he received a son Ratna named 'kanwar'
 kanvar kaa arth he 'kanwal' arthath camel kaa phool
 At the time of naming, Sant Khotram Sahib predicted that just as the lotus flower blossoms in the water and mud of the pond, in the same way 'kanwar' in this world will also be clean, unhappy and the duty path, deeds, sacrifice and sacrifice to the whole world
 Will show the path of baalyavastha se hi sant kanvar raamji kii ruchi ishwar bhakthi or bhajan kirthan main thi
 The echo of his melodious voice spread everywhere around the village

 He used to sing with his melodious voice, and used to sell chickpeas
 jarwar gram main sindh ke mahaan sant khotaaraam sahib ke suputr sant satraam dasji kaa sandhya samay kirthan ho rahaa tha
 At the same time Kishore Kanwar, in a melodious melody and loud voice, sold the sound to the saint's ears
 chane ko sindhi bhashaa main 'kohar' kaha jaataa he
 The meaning of kohar can be understood in such a way that someone should take away my sins
 sant satraam dasji ne kohar bechney vaale sureele kishor kanvar ko sevadariyon ke madhyam se bulawaaya or aagrah kiya ki ve buland or madhur swar main pun: gaayen
 The melodiousness and innuendo of his melodious notes captivated the saintly heart
 sant satraam dasji ne unke sabhi chane le kar sangat main bantwa die or kohar kii keemat ke paise bhi kanvar ne na lekar sampurna kohar unke charnon main rakh die
 Many streams of Santji's blessings came out
 pehali mulaakaat main hi kanvar raamji guru maharaj kii aadhyatm puunji ke uttaradhikari ban gaye
 Kanwarram was sober and humble due to the strict discipline of Surdas 'bhai Hasaramji', a disciple of Shadani saint Tansukh Ram Sahib since childhood, he bowed like a tree bearing fruit at a young age

 aupchaarik nivedan ke uparaant bhai tarachand ne is balak ke janm kaa aashirwad sant khotaaraam sahib dwaara die jane kii jaankaree bhi di
 The attraction of divinity is not from one side but from both sides
 jahaan kanvar ram ko sant satraam das sahib kii seva main jane kii vyakulata thi, vahiin sant satraam das sahib ko bhi suyogy shishy paane kii abhilaashaa vyagr kiye hue thi
 When the eloquent voice of the Guru was severely erupted, Kanwar Ram Sahib's heart rose with lotus
 ve rahadaki ke lok prasiddh darbar main sweekaar kar liye gaye
 His father, brother Tarachand, could only bow down to the gorge due to great pleasure
 ek bhi shabd unke mukh se nahin nikal paaya
 It was a pleasure to accept the son and to be separated from his son Ratna
 donon bhaavon se bhare, ve sachche sant se vidaa lekar apane ghar laut aae

 sant kanvar raamji kii divya kanchan kaaya main anokhi aakarshan shakti thi
 There was a fountain of sweetness in the heart
 mukh se madhur or namr bol nikalate the
 There was a lot of sweetness in his voice, his Kalam and Bhajan had such a sense that thousands of Hindus and Muslims from nearby villages used to gather in the knowledge of Saint Kanwarram Sahib's fate
 ve aksar amrit vela main gaate the or din ke do pahar tak unka bhajan usee tanmayata ke saath chalata rahata tha
 People from far and wide enjoyed his melodious singing, Sufi kalams used to have a greater part in his singing

 manch par asin netaaon ne sant kanvar raamji kii ore dekha or mahatma gandhiji se ajna lekar nivedan kiya ki aap is kolahal ko shant kiijie to baapuji kaa bhaashan armbh kiya ja sake
 As soon as Sant Kanwar Ram Sahib came on the mike and chanted from the famous folk gorge, the whole atmosphere became calm
 tab gandhiji ne bhi is laadle bhakt kii bhuri-bhuri saraahna kii
 With the efforts of this great man, Amarvani of saints and Sufis of India echoed in the city, village, village and house of Sindh

 Sustainable journalism is the responsibility of taking social concerns to the threshold of the system and taking the public welfare policies and schemes to the bottom of the society

 Journalism has not achieved this important place in democracy by itself, but society has given status to the importance of journalistic obligations towards social concerns

 internet or soochna ke aadhikaar ne patrakaron or patrakarita kii dhar ko atyant painaa bana diya lekin iskaa doosraa pahalu yah bhi he ki patrakarita kii aad main in hathiyaaron kaa istemaal ’blakemeling' jaise galat uddeshy ke liye bhi hone laga he
 Some 'sting operations' from time to time and many famous CD scandals are examples of this
 sting patrakarita ke sandarbh main photo jarnalism yaa photo patrakarita se jude jasuson jinhen 'papaaratsi' kehete hai, kii charchaa bhi jarari he
 The princess was the 'born' responsible for Diana's death
 samaaj kii behatari or uski bhalaai ke liye khoji patrakarita kaa ek aavashyak ang jerar he, lekin ise bhi apni maryaada ke ghere main rahanaa chahie
 Investigative journalism is fine up to the adventure, but its audacity is neither in the interest of journalism nor of society
 khel keval manoranjan kaa saadhan nahin balki vah achche swasthya, shaareerik damakham or bauddhik kshamta kaa bhi pratik he
 This is the reason that sports have been prevalent in the world since ancient times
 mall-yuddh, teerandaji, ghudsawaari, tairaaki, gulli danda, polo rassakashi, malakhambh, wal games, jaise outdoor yaa maidani khelon ke alaava chapad, chausar yaa shatranj jaise indor khel prachinkaal se hi lokapriy rahe hai
 Apart from these old games in modern times, similar games and other modern competitive games have established their dominance in the whole world
 khel aadhunik hon yaa pracheen, khelon main honevaale adbhut karnaamon ko jagajaahir karne tathaa uskaa vyapak prachaar-prasar karne main khel patrakarita kaa mahatvapurn yogadan rahaa he
 Today if sports are at the peak of popularity all over the world, then a lot of credit is due to sports journalism
 aaj sthiti yah he ki samachar patron yaa patrikaa ke alaava kisi bhi electronic media kaa scarap tab tak paripurna nahin mana jaataa jab tak usamen khelon kaa bharpoor kawarej nahin ho
 This media trend towards sports is based on 'demand' and 'supply'
 aaj bharat hi nahin puri duniya main aabaadi kaa ek bada hissaa yuva varg kaa he jisaki pehali pasand vibhinn khel spardhaayen hai, shaayad yahi kaaran he ki patr-patrikaa main agar sabase aadhik koi panne pard jate hai to vah khel se sambandhit hote he
 Apart from print media, a large part of TV channels are also associated with sports broadcasting
 khel channel to choubison ghante koi na koi khel lekar hajir hi rahete hai
 Leave aside the matter of live coverage or live telecast, the viewership of the recorded old matches does not seem to be any less
 pathakon or darshakon kii khelon ke prati deewangi kaa hi nateeja he ki aaj khel kii duniya main akut dhan baras rahaa he
 Money, which is in the form of advertisement, even if there is no shortage of looters in the amount of prize money, neither of the recipients
 yah sthiti aaj kii he
 But there was a time when there was no denial of money in sports
 pracheen olympics khelon jaisi vikhyath khel spardhaa main bhi vijeta ko jaitoon kii pattiyon ke mukut kaa puraskaar diya jaataa tha lekin vah taj bhi anmol hua karata tha
 Wealth and rain started in sports with the entry of corporate world
 corporate jagat ke protsaahan se kai khel or khilaadi profeshnal hone-lage or khel-spardha se lakhon karodo kamaane lage
 Today it is raining in sports like tennis, football, basketball, boxing, squash, golf
 khelon kii lokapriyata or khilaadiyon kii kamai kii baat karen to aaj cricket ne, jo duniya ke gine-chune hi deshon main khelaa jaataa he, lokapriyata kii nai unchaaiyaan hasil kii hai
 The budding cricketers are also earning well in comparison to other players due to the corporate trend in the cricket
 khelon main dhan kii barsaat main koi buraai nahin he
 This not only improves the level of sports and players, but the ugly aspect of it is that due to cut-throat competition in sports, the practice of evils like fixing and doping has also started increasing
 phixing or doping jaisi buraayeeyaan na khilaadiyon ke hit main hai or na khalon ke
 It is the responsibility of sports journalism that he should continue to voice the evil of those evils in sports
 khelon main khel bhaavana kii raksha har keemat par honi chahie
 It should also be expected from sports journalism that sports related to common people should be given the same importance and encouragement as other popular sports
 patrakarita jaise vyapak or vishad vishay main mahila patrakarita kii avadharana bhale hi kuch atpati lagati he, kintu nari swatantry or samanta ke is yug main bhi aadhi duniya se jude aise anek pahalu hai jinke mahatva ko dekhte hue mahila patrakarita kii alag vidhaki aavashyaktaa mahasoos hoti he
 The biggest basis of the distinction between male and female is their separate anatomy
 prakruti ne phursh ko ek saanche main dhaala he to nari ko usase alag
 There was a time when the society became furor
 phursh pradhan samaaj ne apni suvidhanusaar nari ko ablaa banaakar ghar kii charadivari tak simit kar diya tha
 The constantly changing phase of development gave women equal opportunities for progress and the process of women leaving their indelible mark in every sphere of society on the strength of their talent and dedication has continued continuously
 aaj ke daur main koi bhi aisa kshetra nahin jahaan mahila kii shashakt upasthiti nahin mahasoos kii ja rahi ho
 In the present era, women have made their way in the fields of politics, administration, army, education, medicine, science, technology, industry, business, social service etc
 on the basis of their talent and ability
 kai kshetron main to kadi spardhaa or kathin chunauti ke baavjood mahila ne apana sheersh mukaam banaaya he
 The pinnacle of success that Indira Nooyi of India, Nainal Kidwai, Chanda Kochhar, etc
 have touched are all considered to be very competitive fields
 teji se badalte saamaajik parivesh tathaa mahila phursh samanta ke is daur main mahilaayein ab ghar kii dahalij laanghakar baahar aa chuki hai
 The presence and participation of women is seen in almost every field
 shiksha ne mahila ko apane aadhikaron ke prati jagarak banaaya he
 Now women are also conscious about their careers
 mahila jaagran kii is navchetana ke saath-saath mahila ke prati atyaachaar or aparaadh ke maamle bhi bade hai
 To ensure the social security of women, many laws have been made and amendments have been made from time to time as per the requirement
 mahila ko saamaajik suraksha dilaane main mahila patrakarita kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 Women journalism has different needs today so that every aspect related to women should be considered in it and it can play an important role in the all round development of women
 mahila patrakarita kii sarthakata mahila shashaktikaran ke uddeshy se judi he
 Some prominent women journalists: Mrinal Pandey, Vimala Patil, Barkha Dutt, Seema Mustafa, Tavleen Singh, Meenal Bahol, Satya Sharan, Dina Vakil, Sunita Airon, Kumud Sanghvi Chawre, Sweta Singh, Poornima Mishra, Mimansa Mallik, Anjana Om Kashyap, Neha Batham, Minakshi Kandwal etc
 aaj bharat main patrakarita ke kshetra main mahila patrakaron ke aane se desh ke har ladki ko apane jivan main aage badhane kii prerana mil rahi he
 Child-mind is naturally inquisitive and simple
 jivan kii yah vah avasthaa he jisamen baccha apane mata-pita, shikshak or chaaro taraf ke parivesh se hi sikhta he
 This is the age in which any event or information is printed on the child's brain
 bachche ke aas-paas kii parivesh uske vyaktitv nirmaan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 There was a time when children were enthralled by enchanting them through fairy tales, folklore, mythological, historical, religious stories
 in kathaa kaa bacchon ke charitrik vikaas par bhi gaharaa prabhaav hota tha
 Today, in this era of communication revolution, information system for children has become quite elaborate and infinite
 computer or internet tak unki pahunch ne unki jigyaas ko aseemit bana diya he
 In such a situation, there is also the possibility of the possibility that information can reach the children as well, due to which the deviation or distortion of their child is also possible
 aisi sthiti main bal patrakarita kii sarthak soch or disha bacchon ko sahi disha kii ore agrasar kar sakati he
 Along with print and visual media, the Internet can also have an important and responsible role in the direction of child journalism
 koi bhi aisa vyapaarik yaa aarthik vyavhaar jo vyaktiyon, sansthaanon, rajyon yaa deshon ke bich hota he, vah aarthik patrakarita ke sarokaaron main shaamil he
 Economic journalism focuses on the axis of review and deliberation of the broad merits of economic behavior or economy
 jis prakaar patrakarita kaa uddadeshy kisi bhi vyavastha ke gun-dosha ko vyapak aadhaar par prachaarit prasaarit karnaa he, usee prakaar aarthik patrakarita kii bhoomika tabhi sarthak he jab vah arth vyavastha ke har pahalu par sookshm najar rakhte hue uskaa vishleshan kare or samaaj par padane vaale uske prabhaavon kaa prachaar-prasar karne main sakasham ho
 In the case of economy, economic journalism plays the role of a vigilante watchdog along with working as a bridge between the system and the consumer
 aarthik udaarikaran or vibhinn deshon ke aapasi vyapaarik sambandhon ne puri duniya ke aarthik pariddashya ko bahut vyapak bana diya he
 Today, the economy of any country has become very dependent on international trade relations
 duniya ke kisi kone main machi aarthik halchal yaa uthal-puthal anya deshon kii arth-vyavastha ko prabhavit karne lagi he
 No economy of the world is untouched today due to precious metals like gold and silver and fluctuations in crude oil prices
 euro, dollar, pand, yen jaisi mudraayen tathaa sona, chaandi or kaccha tel aaj duniya kii pramukh arth vyavastha kii nabj ban chuki hai
 It means to say that today even though all countries are regulators and controllers of their economies, they are not untouched by the economic movements of the world
 ham kah sakate hai ki aarthik pariddashya par puraa vishwa vyapak taur par ek bazaar najar aata he
 The economies of all countries are today determined by the activities of this global market
 majboot arthvyavastha vaale deshon main honevaale mahatvapurn aarthik parivartanon se duniya ke pramukh desh bhi prabhavit hote he
 The economic environment of the world is a challenge for economic journalism
 aarthik patrakarita kaa yah daayitv he ki vishwa kii arthvyavastha ko pabhavit karanevaale vibhinn karkon kaa vishleshan vah lagaataar karti rahe tathaa unke gun-dosha ke aadhaar par ehtiyaati upayon kii charchaa aarthik patrakarita kaa vyapak hissaa bane
 a major challenge before economic journalism is the problem of tax evasion, black money and fake notes
 kalaadhan aaj viksit or vikasshil deshon ke liye ek badi samasya bana hua he
 Black money arises from corruption and only increases corruption
 bhrashtachar kii vyapaktaa antat desh ke vikaas main baadhak banati he
 Economic journalism is also part of the responsibility for the widespread publicity of news highlighting black money and economic crimes
 bharat jaise krishi pradhan desh main hamaari arth vyavastha kaaphi kuch krishi or krishi utpaadon par nirbhar he
 Despite the rapidly developing cities and metros in India, about 70 percent of the country's population still lives in villages
 desh ke bajet praavdhaanon kaa ek bada hissaa krishi evam gramin vikaas ke mad main kharch hota he
 An important dimension of economic journalism is the coverage of agriculture and agro-based schemes and rural development programs
 gramin vikaas ke bina desh kaa vikaas or aarthik patrakarita kaa uddadeshy adhuraa hi rahegaa
 Apart from the traditional fields of business, modern fields of business like retail, insurance, communication, science and technology have given a wide horizon and new dimension to economic journalism
 desh kii arthvyavastha ko sahi disha dekar use suchar or suddadh bananaa aarthik patrakarita ke liye chunauti to he hi uski sarthakata bhi isi main nihit he

 Fate or Destiny with Destiny is the first speech given in Parliament by India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
 is bhaashan ko 20veen sadi ke mahanatam bhaashanon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Many years ago, we made a promise with destiny, and now the time has come for us to fulfill our promise, not to be true but to a great extent
 aadhi raat ke samay, jab duniya so rahi hogi, bharat jivan or swatantraaa ke liye jaag jayega
 Such a moment comes, but rarely comes in history, when we step out of the old into the new era, when an era comes to an end, when the long-buried soul of a country is freed
 yah sanyog hi he ki is pavitra avasar par ham bharat or uske logon kii seva karne ke liye tathaa sabase badhkar maanavtaa kii seva karne ke liye samarpit hone kii pratigya kar rahe hai
 


 Today we are ending an era of misfortune and India is finding itself again

 Even greater victories and achievements await us
 bharat kii seva kaa arth he lakhon-karodon peediton kii seva karnaa
 It means ending poverty, ignorance, and inequality of opportunity
 hamaari peedi ke sabase mahaan vyakti kii yahi ichha he ki har aankh se aansu mite
 It may not be possible for us, but as long as there are tears in our eyes, our work will not end
 aaj ek baar phir varshon ke sangharsh ke baad, bharat jaagrit or swatantra he
 The future is calling us
 hamen kahan janaa chahie or hamen kya karnaa chahie, jisase ham aam aadmi, kisaanon or shramikon ke liye swatantraaa or avasar laa saken, ham nirdhantaa mitaa, ek samrudh, loktantrik or pragatisheel desh bana saken
 Can we create such social, economic and political institutions that ensure the fulfillment and justice of life for every man and woman? No country can become great as long as the thinking or actions of its people are narrow

 Kamayani is an epic of the Hindi language
 iske rachayita jaishankar prasad hai
 It is the best and representative Hindi epic of the modern Shadow era
 'prasad' ji kii yah antim kavy rachana 1936 i
 main prakashit hui, parantu iskaa pranayan praaia: 7-8 varsh purv hi prarambh ho gaya tha
 In this epic of 15 cantos starting from 'anxiety' to 'anand', the gradual eradication of the various frequencies of the human mind has been done with the skill that the history of psychological and cultural development of life from the beginning of human creation till now is also clear
 goes
 kala kii drushti se kamayani chhayavaadi kavyakala kaa sarvottam pratik mana ja saktaa he
 The incarnation of Chittavaritas as the plot characters is another feature of this poem
 or is drushti se lajja, saundarya, shraddha or ida kaa maanav rup main avataran hindi sahitya kii anupam nidhi he
 Kamayani is based on the Pratibhyana philosophy
 saath hi is par aravind darshan or gandhi darshan kaa bhi prabhaav yatra tatra mil jaataa he
 Human forefathers were creatures of a certain race
 kisi bhi prakaar kii chintaa na hone ke kaaran ve 'chir-kishor-vay' tathaa 'nityavilasi' dev aatm-mangal-upasna main hi vibhor rahete the
 Nature could not bear this trespass and took her vengeance
 bheeshan jalplavan ke parinamswaroop devsrushti kaa vinaash hua, keval manu jivit bache
 The concern that mankind developed at the destruction of Devasrishti was at the core of it, due to which she was forced to experience a little death and death
 chintaa ke atirikt manu main daivi or asuri vrittiyon kaa bhi sangharsh chal rahaa tha jiske kaaran unamem ek ore aashaa, shraddha, lajja or ida kaa aavirbhaav hua to duusari ore kamvasana, irsha or sangharsh kii bhi bhaavana jaagi
 The persistent ambush of these antagonistic instincts led to Nirveda awakening in Manu and the same Nirveda with the path of reverence and knowledge of philosophy and mystery respectively and finally led to Anand's achievement
 yah chintaa se anand tak maanav ke manouvaigyanik vikaas kaa kram he
 At the same time, starting the human form of hunting, with the effect of reverence, the development of material development in the form of social and industrial revolution with the support of animal husbandry, farming life and Eda, and finally the attainment of spiritual peace are various steps of human cultural development
 is prakaar kamayani maanav jati ke udbhav or vikaas kii kahani he
 Prasad considers the main characters of this poem 'manu' and Kamputri Kamayani 'shraddha' as a historical person, as well as a historical fact about the occurrence of Jalaplavan
 shatapath brahman ke pratham cond ke aathven adhyay se jalplavan sambandhi ullekhon kaa sankalan kar prasad ne is kavy kaa kathanak nirmit kiya he, saath hi upanishad or puraanon main manu or shraddha kaa jo roopak diya gaya he, unhone use bhi asweekaar nahin kiya, varan kathanak ko aisa swaroop pradaan kiya jisamen manu, shraddha or ida ke roopak kii bhi sangati bhalee bhanti baith jaae
 But by looking at the subtle creation, it seems that the metaphor of these characters has been more beautiful and comfortable, as a historical person they have become completely single and personless
 manu man ke samaan hi asthiramati hai
 First, with the inspiration of reverence, they abandon the ascetic life and take the path of love and love, then the Asura priests come under the seduction of Aakuli and the fortress and be subjected to violence and self-sacrifice, leaving the pleasure-abode of reverence, the hailstorm like Sarair Reach the state; Disgusted by Manu's misbehavior towards Shraddha, one becomes disheartened to hear the curse of the disgusting work and goes to the shelter of the intellect through the connection of Eda and adopts the path of material development
 vahaan bhi sanyam ke abhaav ke kaaran ida par atyaachaar kar baithte hai or praja se unka sangharsh hota he
 Manu, defeated in this struggle and distraught by the rudra wrath of nature, escapes from life and ends up pursuing him in the path of reverence and attains spiritual bliss
 is prakaar shraddha—aastiky bhav—tathaa ida—bauddhik kshamta—kaa manu ke man par jo prabhaav padataa he uskaa sundar vishleshan is kavy main miltaa he
 Kamayani is the epic of the 15 cantos
 ye sarg nimnlikhit hai- Sutra: - Shraddha, with the hope of worry, embarrassed Kama Lust
 karm kii irshyaa se ida ne swapn main sangharsh kiya
 Sleepless kavy rup kii drushti se kamayani chintanapradhan he, jisamen kavi ne maanav ko ek mahan sandesh diya he
 The poet has declared the importance of love in human life as 'tenacity, not just life'
 yah jagat kalyanbhumi he, yahi shraddha kii mul sthapana he
 Love is the only credit and love in this welfare land
 isi prem kaa sandesh dene ke liye kamayani kaa avatar hua he
 Love is human and only human
 manwetar praani, chaahe ve chirvilasi dev hon, chaahe dev or praan kii puja main nirat asur, daitya or daanav hon, chaahe pashu hon, prem kii kala or mahima ve nahin jaanate, prem kii pratishtha keval maanav ne kii he
 But this love requires harmony
 samarasata ke abhaav main yah prem uchhrunkhal pranayvasana kaa rup le letaa he
 Due to the lack of this harmony in Manu's life, human subjects have to bear the curse of work
 bhed-bhav, oonch-neech kii pravriti, aadambar or dambh kii durbhaavna sab isi samrasya ke abhaav se utpann hoti hai jisase jivan du:khamay or abhishapgrast ho jaataa he
 This is the reason for harmony in Kamayani
 yah samarasata dwandv bhaavana main saamanjasy upasthit karti he
 In the world, the origin of duality is the eternal element
 phool ke saath kaante, bhav ke saath abhaav, sukh ke saath du:kha or raatri ke saath din nity laga hi rahata he
 Man chooses one according to his interest in it, abandons the other and this is the reason for his sadness
 maanav ke liye donon ko sweekaar karnaa aavashyak he, kisi ek ko chhod dene se kaam nahin chalata
 This is the coordination position of duality
 prasad ne hriday or mastishk, bhakthi or gyaan, tap, sanyam or pranay, prem, ichha, gyaan or kriya sabake samanvay par bal diya he
 Kamayani is a symbolic poem in which Shamanu, Shraddha, Ida, qilat-akuli, White Taurus etc
 are symbols of mind, intellect, human, demonic sense, religion respectively

 There are many ideologies about the nature of Parabrahma in India
 jisamen dwait, advait yaa keoladvait, vishishtadvait, shuddhadvait, dwaitadvait jaisi kai saidhantik vichaardhaaraein hai
 The Acharya described the form in which Brahma came to know
 itani vichaardhaaraein hone par bhi sabhi yah maanate he ki bhagwaan hi is sristi kaa niyantaa he
 The founder of the Advaita ideology is Shankaracharya, also known as Shankaradvaita or Kevaladvaita
 shankaracharya maanate hain ki sansar main brahm hi satya he
 Everything else is false
 jeev keval agyaan ke kaaran hi brahm ko nahin jaan paata jabaki brahm to uske hi andar virajman he
 He has stated Advaita principle in his Brahmasutra by saying "ego Brahmasmi"
 vallabhacharya apane shuddhadvait darshan main brahm, jeev or jagat, teenon ko satya maanate hai, jise vedon, upanishdon, brahmasutra, gita tathaa shrimadbhagwat dwaara unhone siddh kiya he
 The Advaita principle also permeates the pasture world
 jab pair main kaanta chubhta he tab aakhon se pani aata he or haath kaanta nikaalaneke liye jaataa he
 This is a perfect example of Advaita
 shankaracharya kaa ‘ecobrahm, dwitiyao naasti’ mat tha
 Parambrahm existed before creation
 brahm sat or sristi jagat asat he
 By Shankaracharya's opinion, Brahman is nirguna, passive, sata-asat, separate from work-cause
 brahm ankhon se nahin dekha ja saktaa, man se nahin janaa ja saktaa, vah gyaata nahin he or na gyey hi he, gyaan or kriya ke bhi ateet he
 Due to Maya, the living being is not able to know 'ego Brahma'
