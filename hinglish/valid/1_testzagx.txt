 Sikhism, or Sikhism, is a monotheistic religion and a priest of the formless
 sikh dharm main chandi ke arth hai : Adi Shakti is Vivek intelligence, because Vivek intelligence is taken in Adi Shakti
 sikh dharm ke anusaar guru nanak sahib samet saare satigur, bhakt janon ne bhagoti kaa dhyaan kiya tha
 Guru Gobind Singh Ji made four compositions in which many of Chandi's qualities were expanded, if anyone wants to understand the meaning of Chandi, then Guru Gobind Singh Ji's story is a mine of its meanings and mentions
 guru sahib ne chandi ke anek naam likhe hai jaise bhagoti, khadg dhara, durga, tir, kaali, tupak, as, bhagoti, devtaa, khanda, adar sutaa, parvati, jagabir, jagamaat, para, parabhi, bad baari, kaati, kataari purani, halbi, jwaala, tir, chanchala, laal naina, teg adik jo apane aap main gahare arth rakhte hai
 The Ardas of Sikhism begins from here "pritham Bhagauti Simri Kai Guru Nanak Lai Dhiyai" That is, i am the simile of that fugitive who came to the attention of Nanak Guru
 agar guru gobind singh ji kii rachanaaon or shabdon kaa mulyankan kiya jaae to yah baat saafe prathit hoti he ki guru gobind singh ji ne chandi ko "aadi shakti" hi bataaya he
 If we believe that he created an idol / idol of "adi Shakti" or worshiped according to the prevailing karma incident or worshiped a woman, then Guru Gobind Singh Swayam says in his speech: Pavitri Punita Purani Pereyam
 Prabhu purani parbrahmi ajeyan ॥arupam anupam anamam ामtham Abhitam Ajitam Maha Dharam Dham ॥32॥251॥ jisamen saafe kathith he ki he devi, tera koi rup nahin he, tuun anup he, tera koi naam nahin he
 Not only this, Guru Gobind Singh has described the gross ignorance of idol worship and where the idol worshiper is called Pashu, while the Karma incident has been declared fruitless
 in sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhen to yah baat kahin se bhi jaahir nahin hoti kii guru sahib ne kisi chandi ko kisi murti, istre yaa kisi padaarth rup main mana he
 The whole battle of Chandi is the battle of Vivek intelligence and Indiscreet intelligence
 jahaan vivek buddhi ko "chandi" kaha gaya he or avivek buddhi daitya ke rup main bataaen hai
 The demons are contrary to religion, Devate is busy with the Karma Kand and Chandi is Gurmukh
 guru gobind singh ji ne parasnath avatar rachana main bhi isi tarahaan kii jang kaa khulaasa kiya he
 The stalwarts of Purano also believe that Chandi is the only power and formless, its qualities are displayed in the idol but the idol is not complete in itself

 lekin usamen bhi samasya yah he ki maadaa keval ek he or us maadaa par bhi ek gramin kaa daawa he, ki vah uski paaltu bhens he
 Well the villager has been compensated but the problem remains, the female is giving birth to only male cubs, so far she has given birth to two male calves
 pehle nar shaavak ke janm ke baad hi van adhikariton ne maadaa shaavak ke janm ke liye puja paath or mannaton tak kaa sahaara liya
 Moreover, the government even went a step further and appointed a female head in the garden so that the female buffalo got some hint, but the result was the same, the female again gave birth to the male cub
 shaayad paaltu bhainson par lagu hone vaali kahawat ki bhens ke aage been bajaaye bhens khadi paguravai junglee bhainson par bhi lagu hoti he
 The female gives birth to 5 cubs during her life time, her life span is 9 years
 nar shaavak do varsh kii umr main jhund chhod dete hai
 Cubs are often born at the end of the rainy season
 aam taur par maadaa junglee bhaisen or shaavak jhund bana kar rahati he or nar jhund se alag rahete hai par yadi jhund kii koi maadaa garbh dhaaran ke liye taiyaar hoti he to sabase taqatvar nar uske paas kisi or nar ko nahin aane detaa
 This male usually remains around the herd
 yadi kisi shaavak kii maa mar jaye to duusari maadaayen use apana leti hai
 Their natural enemy is tigers, but wild dogs and leopards have also been seen hunting them if the wild buffalo is weak, old or sick
 vaise inako sabase bada khatra paaltu maweshiyon kii sankramit bimariyon se hi he, inamen pramukh beemaari foot and mouth he
 The disease named Rederpest had at one time greatly reduced their numbers
 in par doosraa bada khatra genetic pradooshan he, junglee bhainsa paaltu bhainson se sampark sthapit kar letaa he
 Although researchers such as Flamand and Tulach believe that the wild male buffalo usually does not allow domesticated male buffaloes to approach the female but themselves approach the domesticated female buffalo, the subject is yet to be thoroughly researched
 madhya bharat ke jin ilaakon main yah paaya jaataa he, vahaan kii paaltu bhaisen bhi inase milti julati najar aati he
 This can be understood by a funny incident
 kuch varshon pehle bijapur ke van-mandladhikari shri raman pandya ke saath bambai natural history socity kii ek team junglee bhaison kaa adhyayan karne or chitra lene ke liye indravati rashtriya udyaan pahaunchi, unhen junglee bhainson kaa ek bada jhund najar aayaa or unke saikado chitra liye gayi or ek shriman jo us samay desh main junglee bhainson ke bade jaankaar maane jate the, baaki logo ko junglee bhainson or paaltu bhainson ke bich antar samajhane main vyast ho gayi tabhi achaanak ek charvaaha aayaa or sari bhainson ko haank kar le gaya
 One of the main reasons why wild buffaloes are on the verge of extinction in central India is their behavior
 jahaan ek ore gaur barish main unche sthanon par chale jate hai, vahi junglee bhainse maidaanon main kheton ke aas paas hi rahete hai or kheto ko bahut nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 For this reason the villagers hunt them
 ek kaaran yah bhi he ki prakritik jangalon kaa vinaash kar diya gaya he or unke sthaan par shahari jaruraton ko puraa karne vaale sagaun, saal, nilgiri jaise pedo kaa ropan kar diya he
 Some of these leaves are inedible, they do not grow the grass under which they eat, anyway wild buffalo feeds very selectively
 is kaaran bhi inkaa gaanv waalon se takaraav bahut bad gaya he
 One of the reasons for increasing conflict is that the tribals used to cultivate without the Berwa system earlier
 isame unako zyada mehnat nahin kerani padati thi
 Pieces of the forest were burnt and seeds were sprinkled in them without stirring
 raakh ek behad uttam urvarak kaa kaam karti thi
 The yield was also very good
 iske alaava jangalo main kandamul or fal bhi prachurtaa se mil jate the
 They did not lack food even from the occasional hunt
 ve kheti par purna rup se nirbhar nahin the
 Therefore, there was no hatred in them when some part of the crop was eaten by the wild animals
 or har do yaa teen saal main jagah badal liye jane ke kaaran pichhli jagah ghaas ke maidan ban jate the
 There was no shortage of fodder for the wild animals
 atah yada kada kiye jane vaale shikaar se unki sankhya main koi kami nahin aati thi
 Now, the tribals have permanent farms, whose fertility is progressively decreasing
 or iname hal chalaanaa kharpatvaar nikaalnaa or urvarak daalane jaise kaam karne padate he, jiname kaafii shram or paisa lagata he
 Apart from this, it is also not allowed to take bamboo and other forest produce for the siege of the fields, so now the tribals become known enemies of wild animals at the loss of their crops
 inhi sab karno se junglee bhainse aaj durlabhtam praaniyon ke shrenee main aa gayi hai

 veydantsaar veydant kii parampara kaa antim granth he jiske rachayita sadanand yogi hai
 It was composed in the 16th century
 veydantsaar, veydant ke siddhanton main saralata se pravesh karne kaa maarg prashast karata he
 From this point of view, it is the most popular work
 veydantsaar ke lekhak sadanand yogindra saraswati hai
 His disciple was Krishnanand Saraswati, whose disciple Narsingh Saraswati wrote the commentary 'subodhini' above Vedantasara
 subodhini ke likhe jane kaa samay shaq samvat 1510 arthath 1588 i0 he
 So Sadanand must have happened before this date
 sadanand ne 1386 i0 ke baad tathaa 1588 i0 ke purv hue
 Sadanand's invocation reveals that his mentor was Advananda Saraswati
 sadanand swayan bhi ‘saraswati’ oopaadhi se vibhooshit the
 This title is one of the ten titles awarded to the ascetics of shankar-vedant
 is oopaadhi se vibhooshit sanyasiyon main advaithasiddhi ke lekhak madhusudansaraswati tathaa brahmanandium ke lekhak brahmanandasaraswati jaise vidvan hue the
 Sadanand himself was also a great scholar
 unke veydantsaar dwaara hamen advait-veydant ke prasiddh aacharyon, udhaahrantah gaudpad, shankar, padmapad, hastamalak, sureshwarachaarya, vachaspatimishra, sriharsh tathaa vidyaarany ke siddhanton main pravesh praapt hota he
 We find references to all these in Vedantasara
 atah yah nishchit he ki sadanand ne in sabhi aacharyon kii kritiyon kaa adhyayan kiya hoga
 Nothing more is known about the author of the Vedantakara
 veydantsaar ke rachayita ne apane granth ke lekhan main praayah sabhi purvavarti pramukh advait veydant ke granthon kaa aashray liya he
 The most prominent among his dependent texts is, the shanirakbhasya of Shankaracharya, on whose principles the basic structure stands
 upanishdon ko bhi aashray banaaya gaya he jahaan se shruti-pramaan ke anek uddhran diye gayi hai
 Apart from this, the quotations of other Vedanta mystics are also given by plurality
 advait-veydant apane aap main ek gudh vishay he
 There is a long tradition of the Acharyas of advaita-vedanta who developed the principles of Vedanta and gave it a rich philosophy
 in aacharyon ke siddhanton main pravesh karnaa koi saral kaary nahin he
 The author of Vedantasara has made this difficult task easy
 advait-veydant ke siddhanton kaa ek samanvit, sankshit tathaa saral rup hamen veydantsaar main praapt hota he
 Vedantasar is also a simple and rich book from the style of view
 veydant ke anek aacharyon kii kritiyon ko padhane par pathak unke vagjal main khokar rah jaataa he
 There is nothing like this in Vedantasar
 lekhak ne atyant saral style main keval sambaddh vishay kii baat kahi he
 Being accessible from both the subject and style point of view, Vedantasara acts as a gateway to embrace the principles of advaita-vedanta
 baldev upaadhyaay ke shabdon main, "'veydantsaar ko saral vivechan ke kaaran veydant ko padhane kaa praarambhik kram kah sakate hai
 '" veydantsaar ko lekhak ne swayan ek prakaran-granth batalaaya he- ‘asya veydantaprakarantvath tadiyerevanubandhisttadvattasiddhern te pruthgalochaniyah
 ' prakaran kii paribhaasha is prakaar di gayi he :- According to this definition, 'case' should not be related to the subject of the whole scripture but should be related to a specific subject of it
 ‘prakaran’ shabd jab granth ke ang ke arth main aata he tab to sadaiv aisa hi hota he kintu jab yah swatantra granth ke arth main prayukt hota he to ham sadaiv usamen shaastra ke ek hi vishay kaa vivechan praapt nahin karte
 Some cases are definitely found where there is a representation of a single topic of scripture, such as Shankaracharya's 'panchakaranaprakaya', but most of the episodes are texts in which the entire topics of scripture are discussed briefly
 nyaay-vaisheshik ke saptapadaarthi, tarksangrah, tarkbhasha aadi granth aise hi hai
 Vedanta's definition of Vedanta, Vedantasara, etc
 are also similar texts
 veydantsaar main advait-veydant ke sabhi vishyon kaa sankshipt nirupan hamen praapt hota he, isi arth main ise prakaran-granth kaha ja saktaa he

 Burning properties depend on oil stress and viscosity

 Parashurama was a Brahmin of Treta Yuga
 unhen vishnu kaa chatha avatar bhi kaha jaataa he
 According to the mythological accounts, he was born to Vaishak Shukla Tritiya from the womb of wife Renuka as a boon to Devraj Indra, pleased with the son's sacrifice performed by Bhrigushrestha Maharishi Jamadagni
 ve bhagwaan vishnu ke chathe avatar the
 Ram was the son of Jamadagni, the son of Jamadagni, who was the son of Jamadagni, who was the son of Jamadagni and he was called Parashurama

 ve ahamkaari or dhrist haihay vanshi kshatriyon kaa prithvi se 21 baar sanhaar karne ke liye prasiddh hai
 He wanted to spread the Vedic culture on the earth
 kaha jaataa he ki bharat ke adhikansh gram unheen ke dwaara basaaye gayi
 Which includes Konkan, Goa and Kerala
 puranic katha ke anusaar bhagwaan parashuram ne tir chalaa kar gujarat se lekar kerala tak samudr ko pichhe dhakel te hue nai bhoomi kaa nirmaan kiya
 And for this reason, Lord Parashurama in Konkan, Goa and Kerala is worshipable and Brahmins born of arrow sharpener are also called Brahmarshi Brahmins, in which Bhumihar Brahmins of Bihar, Chittapavan of Maharashtra, Mohyal of Punjab believe in their successor Lord Parashurama
 ve bhargav gotra kii sabase aagyaakaari santaanon main se ek the, jo sadaiv apane gurujanon or mata pita kii ajna kaa paalan karte the
 He always respected the elders and never disregarded them
 unka bhav is jeev sristi ko iske prakritik saundarya sahit jivant banaaye rakhana tha
 He wanted this whole world to live for animals, birds, trees, fruits and whole nature
 unka kahana tha ki raja kaa dharm vaidic jivan kaa prasar karnaa he naaki apni praja se ajnapaalan karwaanaa
 He was born as a Brahmin but was a Kshatriya by karma
 unhen bhargav ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is also known that Parshuram learned most of his knowledge from his mother's teachings in his childhood
 ve pashu-pakshiyon tak kii bhashaa samajhate the or unase baat kar sakate the
 Even many ferocious wild animals became their friends only by their touch
 unhone sainyashiksha keval brahmanon ko hi di
 But there are some exceptions like Bhishma and Karna
 unke jane-maane shishy the - Karna did not know that he is a Kshatriya by birth
 vah sadaiv hi swayan ko samajhataa rahaa lekin uskaa samarthy chupa na rah sakaa
 He did not tell Parashuram that he is a prince and got education from Lord Parashuram
 yadi karn unhe apane shudra hone kii baat bataa bhi dete to bhi bhagwaan parashuram karn ke tej or samarthy ko dekh unhe saharsha shiksha dene ko taiyaar ho jate
 But when Parashurama came to know about this, he cursed Karna that all his knowledge taught will not work for him when he needs it most
 isliye jab kurukshetra ke yuddh main karn or arjuna aamane saamne hote he tab vah arjuna dwaara maar diya jaataa he kyonki us samay karn ko brahmastra chalaane kaa gyaan dhyaan main hi nahin rahaa
 In ancient times, a king named Gadhi ruled in Kannauj
 unki satyavati naam kii ek atyant rupavati kanya thi
 King Gadhi married Satyavati to Bhrigunandan Rishiak
 satyavati ke vivaah ke pashchaat vahaan bhrigu rishi ne aakar apni putravadhu ko aashirwad diya or usase var maangane ke liye kaha
 Seeing this, Satyavati pleaded with the son of a son for his mother
 satyavati kii yachana par bhrigu rishi ne use do charu paatr dete huye kaha ki jab tum or tumhaari mata ritu snaan kar chuki ho tab tumhaari maan putr kii ichha lekar pipal kaa aalingan karnaa or tum usee kaamana ko lekar gooler kaa aalingan karnaa
 Then take these variables given by me with caution separately
 idhar jab satyavati kii maan ne dekha ki bhrigu ne apane putravadhu ko uttam santaan hone kaa charu diya he to usne apane charu ko apni putree ke charu ke saath badal diya
 In this way Satyavati consumed her mother's charu
 yogashakti se bhrigu ko is baat kaa gyaan ho gaya or ve apni putravadhu ke paas aakar bole ki putree! tumhaari mata ne tumhaare saath chal karke tumhaare charu kaa seven kar liya he
 Therefore, now your child will behave like a Kshatriya despite being a Brahmin and your mother's child will behave like a Brahmin despite being a Kshatriya
 is par satyavati ne bhrigu se vinati kii ki aap aashirwad den ki meraa putr brahman kaa hi aacharan kare, bhale hi meraa pautra kshatriya jaisaa aacharan kare
 Pleased, Bhrigu accepted her request
 samay aane par satyavati ke garbh se jamadagni kaa janm hua
 Jamadagni was very stunning
 bade hone par unka vivaah prasenjit kii kanya renuka se hua
 He had five sons from Renuka, whose names were Rukmavan, Sukhen, Vasu, Vishvanas and Parashurama
 shrimadbhagwat main drushtaant he ki gandharvaraj chitrarath ko apsaraon ke saath vihaar karata dekh havan hetu ganga tat par jal lene gai renuka aasakt ho gayi or kuch der tak vahiin ruk gayin
 Enraged by the lapse of the Havan period, Jamadagni ordered all the sons to kill Mata Renuka as a punishment for his wife's anti-arya conduct and mental adultery
 anya bhaaiyon dwaara aisa dussahas na kar paane par pita ke tapobal se prabhavit parashuram ne unki aagyaanusaar mata kaa shiroched evam unhen bachaane hetu aage aaye apane samast bhaaiyon kaa vadh kar daalaa
 Pleased with his work, when Jamadagni urged him to ask for the groom, Parashuram asked for the blessing of everyone being revived and the memory of his slaughter being destroyed
 kathanak he ki haihay vanshadhipati karttvirarjun ne ghor tap dwaara bhagwaan dattatreya ko prasann kar ek sahastra bhujaayen tathaa yuddh main kisi se parrast na hone kaa var paaya tha
 Coincidentally, he ventures into the forest to Jamadagnimuni's ashram and takes Kamadhenu by force, snatching Kamdhenu, disobeying Lobashish Jamadagni, at the wonderful hospitality of the entire army, assisted by Kapila Kamadhenu, provided to him by Devraj Indra
 kupit parashuram ne farse ke prahaar se uski samast bhujaayen kaat daaleen va sir ko dhad se pruthak kar diya
 Then Sahastrajun's sons killed his meditative father Jamadagni in the absence of Parashurama as a vengeance
 renuka pati kii chitaagni main pravisht ho sati ho gayin
 Parshuram, angry with this scandal, attacked the city of Mahishmati with full speed and took possession of it
 iske baad unhone ek ke baad ek puure ikkis baar is prithvi se kshatriyon kaa vinaash kiya
 Not only this, he filled the five ponds of Sthalat Panchak area with the blood of Haihay Vanshi Kshatriyas and performed the father's shraddha with the blood of Sahastrajun's sons
 ant main maharishi richik ne prakat hokar parashuram ko aisa ghor krity karne se roka
 After this, he performed Ashwamedha Mahayagya and donated the earth containing Saptadweep to Maharishi Kashyapa
 keval itnaa hi nahin, unhone devraj indra ke samaksh apane shastr tyaag diye or sagar dwaara ucchhisht bhubhag mahendra parvat par ashram banaakar rahane lage
 Parashurama is believed to have destroyed the Haihayavanshi Kshatriyas 21 times
 kshatriyon kaa ek varg he jise haihyavanshi samaaj kaha jaataa he yah samaaj aaj bhi he
 Sahastrajun was a king in this society
 parashuram ne isi raja or inke putr or pautron kaa vadh kiya tha or unhen iske liye 21 baar yuddh karnaa padaa tha
 Who was Sahastrarjun ?: Sahastrarjun was a Chandravanshi king whose ancestors were Mahishmant
 mahishmant ne hi narmada ke kinare mahishmati naamak nagar basaaya tha
 Later, after Durdum, Kritavirya, the eldest of the four sons of Kanak, assumed the throne of Mahishmati
 bhargav vanshi brahman inke raaj purohit the
 Kritavirya had a good relationship with Bhargava chief Jamadagni Rishi
 kritaviry ke putr kaa naam bhi arjuna tha
 Being the son of Kritavirya, he is also called Kartaviryaarjuna
 karttaviryarjun ne apni aradhana se bhagwaan dattatreya ko prasann kiya tha
 Lord Dattatreya had given Kartavirajun a boon to receive the force of a thousand hands at the time of war, due to which he came to be called Sahastrajun or Sahasrabahu
 sahatrarjun ke parakram se ravan bhi ghabaraata tha
 Reason for the war: Sahastrajun was killed due to the curse of the sage Vasishta
 sahatrarjun ne parashuram ke pita jamadagni ke ashram main ek kapila kamdhenu gaay ko dekha or use paane kii laalasaa se vah kamdhenu ko balpurvak ashram se le gaya
 When Parashurama came to know about this, he thought of bringing back Kamadhenu for the honor of his father and fought with Sahastrajun
 yuddh main sahatrarjun kii sabhi bhujaayen cat gayi or vah maaraa gaya
 Then Sahastrajun's sons retaliated and killed his father Jamadagni in Parashurama's absence
 parashuram kii maan renuka pati kii hatya se vichlit hokar unki chitaagni main pravisht ho sati ho gayin
 This terrible incident enraged Parashurama and he vowed - "I will die by destroying all the Kshatriyas of the Haihaya dynasty"
 uske baad unhone ahamkaari or dusht prakruti ke haihyavanshi kshatriyon se 21 baar yuddh kiya
 Burning in anger, Parashurama first captured the Mahishmati city of the Haihayavans and then killed Kartaviryaarjuna
 karttaviryarjun ke divangat hone ke baad unke paanch putr jaidhvaj, shurasen, shur, vrish or krishna apane astitv kii ladaai ladate rahe
 In the Brahmavaivarta Purana, the story is found that Parshuram tried to force his entry into Ganesh ji when he entered the harem of Lord Shankar at Kailash
 tab ganpati ne unhen stambhit kar apni sund main lapetakar samast lokon kaa bhraman karaate hue golok main bhagwaan shrikrishna kaa darshan karake bhootal par patake diya
 On coming into consciousness, one of Ganesha's teeth broke due to the blow of the ax made by the angry Parshuramji, so that he was called Ekadanta
 unhone tretayug main ramavatar ke samay shivaji kaa dhanush bhang hone par akaash-maarg dwaara mithilapuri pahunch kar pratham to swayan ko "vishwa-vidit kshatriya kul drohi" bataate hue "bahut bhanti tinh aankh dikhaaye" or krodhandh ho "sunhu ram jehi shivadhanu tora, sahasabahu sam so ripu mora" tak kah daalaa
 Thereafter, after clearing the doubt of his power, Vaishnav handed Dhanush to Shri Ram and returned to the forest for penance, apologizing "unjustly saying too much ignorance, forgiving forgiveness"
 ramcharita maanas kii ye panktiyaan sakshi hai- "kah jai jai jai raghukulaketu, bhrigupati gayi vanhin tap hetu"
 According to the story narrated in Valmiki Ramayana, Dasharathanandan Sriram worshiped Jamadagni Kumar Parashurama and Parashurama revolved around Ramachandra and proceeded towards the ashram
 jate jate bhi unhone shriram se unke bhakton kaa satat saannnidhya evam charnaravindon ke prati sudruth bhakthi kii hi yachana kii thi
 Amba came to Parashurama seeking vengeance and help as Bhishma did not accept it
 tab sahaayta kaa aashwaasan dete hue unhone bhishma ko yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 There was a fierce battle between them for 23 days
 kintu apane pita dwaara ichha mrityu ke vardaan swarup parashuram unhen haraa na sake
 Parashurama was donating his lifetime's earnings to the Brahmins, when Dronacharya reached him
 kintu durbhagyavash ve tab tak sab kuch daan kar chuke the
 Parshuram then kindly asked Dronacharya to choose any weapon
 tab chatur dronacharya ne kaha ki main aapke sabhi astr shastr unke mantron sahit chahta hoon taaki jab bhi unki aavashyaktaa ho, prayog kiya ja sake
 Parashuramaji said- "evamastu!" That is to be so
 isse dronacharya shastr vidya main nipun ho gayi
 Parashurama was also a guru of Karna
 unhone karn ko bhi vibhinn prakaar ki astr shiksha di thi or brahmastra chalaanaa bhi sikhaaya tha
 But Karna was the son of a sutra, yet knowing that Parashurama only donated his discipline to Brahmins, Karna tricked and tried to take the genre from Parashurama

 In the modern era, the consumption of minerals and metals has become so high that they are required by millions of tons every year
 is khapat kii purti ke liye badi-badi khaanon kii aavashyaktaa kaa uttarottar anubhav hua
 Consequently, miners have taken the form of elaborate engineers
 isko khanan ejiniyari kehete hai
 In many countries of the world, of which India is also one, mining has been practiced since ancient times
 vastav main pracheen yug main dhaatuon tathaa anya khanijon kii khapat bahut kam thi, isliye choti-choti khan hi paryaapt thi
 At that time these mines did not go beyond 100 feet depth
 jahaan pani nikal aayaa karata tha vahaan neeche khanan karnaa asambhav ho jaataa tha; us samay aadhunik dhang ke pump aadi yantra nahin the

 There are three main parts of exploration: planar exploration, drilling and underground exploration
 khanikarm ko mukhya rup se teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya hai : In this type of mining, minerals are obtained by breaking the mountains etc
 above the ground, such as limestone, sandstone, granite, iron ore etc
 is vidhi main mukhya kaary pathar ko todna hi hai
 The rocks differ in hardness, firmness and firmness
 jo shilaayein komal hoti hai, unako todane main koi kathinaayee nahin hoti
 Examples of such rocks are gypsum, ceramic, cellar etc
 jin shilaon main dhaatuen milti hai ve atyant kathor hoti hai, jaise granite, diorite aadi
 These rocks are broken by explosive materials

 Gradually mining methods developed and gunpowder etc
 started being used in them
 vigat ek shatabdi main dianemite, jelignite, nitroglisreen aadi anek prakaar ke anyaay visphotak padaarthon kaa vikaas hua
 In order to use explosive materials in mining, holes are first made in the rocks and these explosives which are found in the form of cartridges, are kept and they are set on fire by electrocution or fuses
 visphot ke saath hi pathar ke tukade tukade ho jate hai
 These are then broken down and reduced by money, which facilitates their removal
 pattharon main chhidr banane ke liy jaik haimer aadi anek prakaar ke vedhanyantron kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 These devices are powered by compressed air or any liquid fuel
 chhidron kii gaharaai 3-4 foot tak tathaa vyas 1-1 / 2 inch se lekar 2 1 / 2 inch tak hota he

 The major requirement in alluvial mining method is the huge amount of water
 pani kaa dabaav 50 se 600 foot tak ho saktaa he
 The value of mining is also low, as it does not require any power other than water-generated power
 is prakaar khanit padaarthon kii maap ghan gajon main kii jaati he
 The use of mechanical means is also used in the mining of large deposits and sometimes up to 30 feet thickness deposits are mined by this method

 The wells are of great importance in underground mining, as these are operated by the workers to come to the mine, exhaust the miners, operate the air and pump the water out of the mine
 kisi bhi khan main kam se kam do coop avashya hote hai
 Shovels, spades, and sabbles or instruments or explosives are used to break minerals and ores
 praytn is baat kaa kiya jaataa he ki khanij kii adhikadhik maatra nikaal lee jaay
 But this causes the balance of rocks in the mine to deteriorate

 The walls and roof of the mine need to be supported to keep the rock balance in the mine from deteriorating
 iske liye jis str par kaary chal rahaa he usamen stambh chhod die jate he or aasapaas se khanij nikaal liya jaataa he
 However, a significant amount of mineral is lost in it
 isaliye aajkal praytn yah kiya jaataa he ki khaali sthanon main baaluu athwa vaisaa hi koi anya padaarth bhar diya jaay tathaa un stambhon kaa khanij bhi nikaal liya jaay
 This method is used in most Indian coal mines
