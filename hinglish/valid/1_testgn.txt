 The Lord of the Rings is a novel written in English by J
J
 R
 R
 Tolkien
 ye upanyaas asal main teen kitabon kaa silsilaa he, jo khud kii tolkin ke ek pichley kaary da hobit kii ek kadi kii tarah he
 These novels were shot in three Hollywood films in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with Peter Jackson as the director
 teenon filmein hollywood main dhooma-dham se hit raheen or inhone kai auskar inaam bhi jite
 The story of this novel is fictitious
 madhya dharti is upanyaas main zikr ek kaalpanik mahadweep he jo chaaron taraf se samandaron se ghira hua he
 There is another continent to its west, named Valinor
 valinore devataaon kii bhoomi he jahaan insaan nahin ja sakate
 The story begins with a black demon in Middle Earth named Sauron who specializes in black magic
 pratham yug ke ant main souron apane shaitani maalik morgoth melcor kii devataaon dwaara haar se batch nikalataa he
 In the second era, Sauron dreams of becoming the king of the world
 iske liye wo tohafon ke maalik annatar kaa sundar bhes banaakar gandharvon ke paas gaya or unke loharon ke mukhiya celebrimbor or duusare loharon ko dhokhe se phusalaakar unase kai jaadui anguuthiyaan banavaain
 But in a mysterious and secret way he made another gold ring himself: that ring
 isamen usne duniya kii sari shaitaniyat or jaadui takat bhar di
 That one ring was the master of all the other rings and the one wearing it could make all the ring wearers their slave
 ye yojana naakaamayaab hoti he jab gandharvon ko is dhokhe kaa pataa chalata he or wo apane liye banaayi teen angoothiyon ko utaar dete hai
 Sauron Gandharva snatches all the rings to make this war
 saat anguuthiyaan souron ne bunon ke saradaaron ko deen or nau insaanon ke saradaaron ko
 The Gandharvas hid their three rings after saving them
 boune apane aantarik jaadu kii vajah se angoothiyon se khaas prabhavit nahin hue, par insaan prabhavit hue
 The nine ring-wearers became demonic phantoms within a few years and remained Sauron's loyal servants until the end
 numenore dweep kaa raja aar-faraajoun madhya dharti par kabza karne aata he or soron ko bandi banaakar numenore le jaataa he
 Conversely there, Sauron lures the king and leads him to wickedness and annihilates the island of Numanor and almost all the Numanorites
 kuchhek achche numenori insaan madhya bhoomi tak bachakar pahunch jate hai or vahaan ek nayi sabhyataa basaate hai : gondor kaa rajya
 Here Amar Sauron takes another form and reaches back to the middle ground, ending the rest of the Numenoris
 is samay gandharv or insaan ek maitri sanghathan banaate hai or milakar souron or uski daityon kii sena ko haraa dete hai
 The crown prince of the Numanoris, Isildur Elendil, bites Sauron's finger from his dead father's broken talvar narcil and snatches a ring from it and ends Sauron's physical existence
 souron kii pretatma kahin or bhaag jaati he
 This is how the third era begins
 ab numenoroyon ke naye raja isildur kaa karttavya banataa tha ki wo us ek anguthi ko vinaash ke parvat, jo ek jwalamukhi tha, main jalte hue lave main daal de, kyonki is dusht anguthi or iske swami ke sarvanaash kaa koi or tarika nahin tha
 But that one ring had a magical desire of its own, to somehow return to its master Sauron
 us jaadui anguthi ke prabhaav se isildur ne use nasht nahin kiya balki apane paas rakh liya
 Later some demons killed him and dropped his body in the river
 is tarah wo shaitani anguthi pani main gum ho gayi, ek puure yug ke liye
 This whole story is mostly mentioned in the novel The Silmarillon
 da hobit upanyaas main ek insaan-jaisi nasl kaa varnan he, jo hobit kahe jate the
 Hobbits were peaceful little men, almost as tall as dwarfs
 gollum naam ke ek bahishkrut hobit ke haathon ek baar wo ek anguthi lag jaati he
 Golum transforms that satanic ring into a mad, ugly and evil beast
 ek hobit bilbo bagins ko apni romaanchak yatra ke dauraan kisi tarah gollum se wo shaitani anguthi mil jaati he
 Bilbo's old age begins the story of the novel The Lord of the Rings
 wo shaitani anguthi koi jad yaa achetan vastu nahin thi, balki usamen apni khud kii ek chahat, ek ichha thi
 The ring itself was chosen as its short-lived owner, so that it could return to its rightful owner, Sauron
 agar koi bhi us anguthi ko apni ungali main pahane, to wo duniya kii nazar se gaayab ho jaataa tha 
 After some time, Sauron returned as Mordor's demonic tower back to Bard-far
 usne ek vishaal aankh kaa rup le liya, jo aag se ghiri rahati thi or hameshaa wo anguthi dhundti rahati thi
 If a person wore a ring, this search would be fast and Sauron started to feel something about the wearer's address
 agar us vaqt aas-paas koi nazgul ho to use turant anguthi pahananevaale kaa pataa lag jaataa tha
 The wearer of the ring, just like wearing it, would have reached another hazy world
 us vyakti ko dhundhala dikhaayi dene lagata tha, lekin sunne kii shakti koob tej ho jaati thi
 Sometimes in such a situation Sauron and the wearer could even see each other
 or to or, angoothivahak ko is anguthi kii lat lag jaati thi or use is anguthi se ek ajeeb bandhan ho jaataa tha
 The ring was made of pure gold and no gems were attached to it
 uske andar ke vilay main mordor kii shaitani bhashaa main likhaa tha : The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring was the first episode of this series
 is puri shrunkhlaa kaa nayak he shaayar naam ke ek chote se gaanv kaa ek hobit frodo bagins 
 Frodo was the nephew of Bilbo Baggins
 note karen ki apane jeniyas kaa parichay dete hue tolkin ne na keval ek puri puranic gaatha kii rachana kii, balki usamen kam se kam do nayi kritrim bhashaayen bhi banaayin : khaas taur par gandharvon kii shastreey bhashaa kvenya or unki lokbhasha sindarin 
 Many words and phrases from both languages are scattered among the English throughout the novel

 Upon Frodo's debut there, it was decided that Frodo would become the ring bearer and that s would go to Mordor and throw him in the mountain of doom in Lawe's hull, causing the ring and Sauron to be destroyed

 There, a black firefighter fell into the depths of Gandalf Khan while fighting the disease
 vahaan se ye maitri gayi gandharvon ke ek duusare shahar main : lothalorian, jahaan frodo ne gandharvarani galadriyal ke aaine main apane kathin bhavishya kii kuch jhalken dekhin
 After this, these people went to the border of Gondor through boats in Mahanadi Anduin

 Jain literature is very vast
 adhikansh main vah dharmik sahitya hi he
 This literature has been written in Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages
 mahavir kii pravritiyon kaa centre magadh rahaa he, isaliye unhone yahan kii lokbhasha ardhamagadhi main apana upadesh diya jo uplabdh jain aagmon main surakshit he
 These are 45 and consider Shwetambara Jain evidence, not Digambara Jain
 dingbaron ke anusaar aagam sahitya kaaldosh se vicchhinn ho gaya he
 Digambara accepts the hetkhandagam which has been considered part of the 12th Anglicism
 digambaron ke pracheen sahitya kii bhashaa shauraseni he
 Later, Jain pundits enriched the language literature by writing their compositions in the later folk-languages of Apabhransh and Apabhransh
 adikalin sahitya main jain sahitya ke granth sarvaadhik sankhya main or sabase pramanik rup main milte hai
 Jain creators composed a variety of texts like Purana poetry, Charit poetry, Katha poetry, Ras poetry
 swayambhu, pushp danta, hemchandra, somprabh suri aadi mukhya jain kavi hai
 He also made the folk tales prevalent among Hindus the subject of his creations and showed his culmination to be different from tradition
 jain-sahitya kaa pracheenatam bhaag ‘aagam’ ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 These proceeds are 46- aagam granth kaaphi pracheen he, tathaa jo sthaan vaidic sahitya kshetra main veda kaa or buddha sahitya main tripitak kaa he, vahi sthaan jain sahitya main aagmon kaa he
 In the Agam texts, there is a compilation of many stories and stories related to the teachings of Mahavira and Jain culture
 jain parampara ke anusaar mahavir nirvana ke 160 varsh pashchaat magadh deshon main bahut baari dushkaal padaa, jiske falswaroop jain bhikshuon ko anyatra vihaar karnaa padaa
 At the end of the period, Shramana gathered in Pataliputra and eleven organs were compiled piece by piece, the twelfth organ was not remembered, so it could not be compiled
 is sammelan ko 'patliputra-vaachana' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 After some time, when the Agama literature began to be severed again, the second conference of Jain monks took place after 827 or 840 years of Mahavir Nirvana
 ek aryaskandil kii adhyakshata main mathura main tathaa doosraa nagarjun suri kii adhyakshata main valbhi main
 The conference at Mathura has been called 'mathuri-vachana'
 tatpashchaat lagbhag 150 varsh baad, mahavir nirvana ke 980 yaa 993 varsh baad valbhi main devardhigani kshamashraman kii adhyakshata main saadhuon kaa chauthaa sammelan hua, jisamen suvyavasthit rup se aagmon kaa antim baar sankalan kiya gaya
 It is called by the name of 'valabhi-vachana'
 vartmaan aagam isi sankalana kaa rup he
 The history of the above three conferences of the Jain Agama shows that Agama literature suffered from time to time, and this literature in its original form could not remain secure
 yahi kaaran maaloom hota he ki baudhon ke vipul sahitya ke mukaable yah sahitya bahut nune he, tathaa is sahitya main vikaar aa jane se hi sambhavtah digambar sampradaay ne ise maananaa asweekaar kar diya
 This literature depicting the economic and social condition of India from the fourth century BC to the fifth century CE is of importance in many respects
 ayaarang, sooyagdan, uttarajaiyan, dasveyali aadi granthon main jo jain bhikshuon ke aachaar-vichaaron kaa vistrut varnan he, vah baudhon ke dhammapad, suttanipat tathaa mahabharat aadi granthon se bahut anshon main mail khaataa he, or dow
 vinternij aadi vidwaanon ke kathananusaar vah shraman-kavy kaa pratik he
 In terms of language and subject etc
, this part of Jain proceeds seems to be the oldest
 bhagwati kalpasutra, ovaiy, thanang, niryavali aadi granthon main shraman bhagavan mahavir, unki charya, unke upadeshon tathaa tatkaaleen raja, rajkumaar or unke yuddh aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisase jain itihaas kii luptpraaya anek anushrutiyon kaa pataa lagata he
 Nayadhammakha, Uvasagadasa, Antagadadasa, Anuttarovvaiyadsa, Vivagasuya, etc
, have many stories and stories told by Mahavira and his disciples, in which many things related to Jain tradition are introduced
 rypanesi, jeevabhigam, pannavna aadi granthon main vaastushastra, sangeet, vanaspati aadi sambandhi anek mahatvapurn vishyon kaa varnan he jo praayah anyatra uplabdh nahin hota he
 Aanthasutras have a detailed description of the dieting and atonement etc
 of the sages, which can be compared with the Vinayapitaka of Buddhists
 vrihatkalpasutra main bataaya gaya he ki jab mahavir saket subhumibhag naamak udyaan main vihaar karte the to us samay unhone apane bhikshu-bhikshuniyon ko saket ke purv main ang-magadh tak dakshai ke kaushambi tak, tathaa uttar main kunala tak vihaar karne kii anumati di
 This shows that initially the propagation of Jainism was limited, and Jain Shramans could not go elsewhere except Magadha and parts of Uttar Pradesh
 nissandeh chhedsutron kaa yah bhaag utana hi pracheen he jitne swayan mahavir
 Subsequently, Jain inscriptions of Mathura, contemporary to King Kanishka, mention different ganas, clans and branches, they often coincide with the ganas, clans and branches mentioned in the Kalpasutra of Bhadarwahu
 isse bhi jain aagam granthon kii pramanikta kaa pataa chalata he
 In fact, till this time, the difference between Shwetambar and Digambar is not known in Jain tradition
 jain aagmon ke vishay, bhashaa aadi main jo pali tripitak se samanta he, vah bhi is sahitya kii pracheenta ko dyotit karti he
 Like the fables of Pali Sutras, several commentaries, commentaries, Deepika, retirement, description, Avachoori etc
 have also been written
 is sahitya ko saamanyata niryukti, bhashya, churni or tikaa-in chaar vibhaagon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he, aagam ko milakar ise 'paanchangi' ke naam se kehete hai
 Like Agama literature, this literature is also of great importance
 isamen aagmon ke vishay kaa vistaar se pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 There are many recommendations in this literature, which are historically very important
 vrihatkalpbhaashya, vyavahaarabhashya, nishithchurni, aavashyakchurni, aavashyaktikaa, uttaradhyayan tikaa aadi tikaa-granthon main puraatatv sambandhi vividh saamagree bhari padi he, jisase bharat ke reeti-rivaaj, meley tyohaar, sadhu-sampradaay, dushkaal, baadh, chor-lutere, saarthwah, vyapaar ke maarg, shilp, kala, bhojan-shaastra, makaan, aabhushan, aadi vividh vishyon par bahut prakaash padataa he
 This literature is also very important in terms of folklore and philology
 dow
 In the words of Winter- churni-sahitya main praakrit mishrit sanskrit kaa upyog kiya gaya he, jo bhashashastra kii drushti se vishesh mahatva kaa he, or saath yah us mahatvapurn kaal kaa dyotak he jab jain vidwaan praakrit kaa aashray chhodkar sanskrit bhashaa kii ore bad rahe the
 Over time, pravachansaar, Ratnarkand Shravachar, purusharth siddhupaay, Precept dhawala tikaa, Mahadhawala commentary, kasaaypahud, Jayadhavala Commentary, yogasar, Almanac barsanuvekkha, Optics ashtashti tikaa, Ashtasahri vaccine, tattwarthrajvarthik tikaa, Epistemological vaccine, samadhitantra,, Bhagwati worship, mulaachaar, Gomtsar, dravyasangrah, Bhadrabahu Samhita tattwarth sutara, acharya umaswami dwaara rachit jain granth he
