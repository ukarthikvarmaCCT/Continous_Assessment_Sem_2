 Bernoulli observed that this sequence can be formulated as follows: jahaan n ek saal main chakravriddhi kiye jane vaale byaaj kii sankhya he
 The balance of a loan with regular monthly payments is augmented by the monthly interest charged and reduced by the payments, therefore jahaan, By iterative substitution one can derive expressions for Bk, which are linearly proportional to B0 and p, and the use of a partial sum formula of a geometric series results in the following, B0 or Bn ke sandarbh main p ke liye is abhivyakti kaa ek samaadhaan nimna tak kam hota he, n To find out the payment amount in full to repay the loan, the person sets Bn = 0
 jo piemti kaary spredshit programs main main paaya jaataa he ve ek rin ke masik bhugtan kii gananaa karne main upyog kiye ja sakate hai: An interest-only payment on the current balance will be, rin par kul byaaj, IT bhugtan nimna hoga, The formula for a regular savings program is the same, but the payments are added to it rather than subtracted from the outstanding balance and the formula for payment is negative from above
 ye sutara keval anumaanit hai kyonki vaastavik bakaayaa rin rounding se prabhavit hote hai
 The payment should be increased to the next cent to avoid underpaying at the end of the loan
 aisi sthati main antim bhugtan Bn-1 hona chahie Consider a similar loan, but with a new term equal to k of the time period of the above question
 If rk and pk are new rates and payments, now we have, Bk ke saath is abhivyakti kii tulana karne se hame pataa chalata he, The previous equation gives us the opportunity to define the same constant for both problems, or Bk likhaa ja saktaa he, By solving for rk we get a formula for rk that includes the known quantity and Bk, which is the money remaining after the k period, jaisaa kii B0 rin kaa koi bhi bakaayaa raashi ho saktaa he, yah formula k avadhi dwaara vibhajit kiye gaye koi bhi do bakaayaa raashiyon ko alag karata he or salanaa byaaj dar ke liye mulya kii gananaa karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 b * is an invariant scale because it does not change with the change in length of the period
 B* ke liye sameekaran kaa ulatpher karne par vyakti ko ek parivartan gunank praapt hota he , And we see that r and p change in the same way, bakaayaa raashi main isi tarah parivartan hota he, Which gives an insight into the meaning of some of the coefficients found in the above formulas
 vaarshik dar, r12, keval ek bhugtan prati varsh ko hi maanata he or yah masik bhugtan ke liye ek "prabhavi dar" nahin he
 Monthly interest is paid out of each payment by monthly payment and therefore should not be compounded and an annual rate of 12
r is more reasonable
 yadi koi vyakti keval byaaj bhugtan karata he varsh bhar ke liye kiye gaye bhugtan kii raashi 12

b0
 When we substitute pk = rk b * in the equation for Bk, we get Bn = 0 ke baad ham B* ke liye bhi hal kar sakate hai, Substituting back into the formula for Bk implies that this is a rk linear function and therefore λk, yah bakaayaa raashi kaa akalan karne kaa sabase aasaan tarika he yadi λk gyaat ho
 By substituting the first formula for Bk above and finding a solution for λk + 1, we get upar die gaye λk formula kaa prayog karke yaa λ0 = 0 se λn tak se baari baari λk kii gananaa karke, λ0 or λn ko paaya ja saktaa he
 While the formula for payment of p = rb * is reduced to the following, or rin kii avadhi main ausat byaaj dar he, Which is less than r if n> 1

 After spending four years in the palace of Kubera on the Gandhamadan mountain, the Pandavagans departed from there and stayed in many forests en route, suppressing the wicked from place to place with their valor and might, benefiting from the satsang of sages and Brahmins

 On the pretext of conducting his cow-property audit, inspection etc

 But in that lake, Gandharvaraj Chitraratha was already coming and playing water sports with his wives
 chitrarath ke sevakon ne duryodhana ko sarovar main utarane se rokte huye kaha, “is samay gandharvaraj chitrarath apni patniyon ke saath is sarovar main jalakrida kar rahe hai, atah unke baahar aane se pehle anya koi bhi sarovar main nahin utar saktaa
 Hearing these words of the servants, Duryodhana was furious and said, "you probably don't know with whom you are talking

 This lake comes under the boundary of our state

 Duryodhana's companions and army continued to fight for some time, but after finding Chitraratha more powerful, they left all the Duryodhana and royal women there and ran away
 chitrarath ne duryodhana or un rajmahilaon ko kaid kar liya
 When the fugitive army of Duryodhana did not think of anything, they went to the Pandavas residing there and started pleading with them for the liberation of Duryodhana and the nobles
 unki yachana sunakar bhimsen ne prasann hokar yudhisthir se kaha, “bade bhaiya! duryodhana apane rajasi vaibhav kaa hamaare saamne pradarshan karne yahan aayaa tha
 Gandharvas have acted in our interest by taking the plight of Duryodhana
 aap kadaapi use mat chhudaana
 On this Yudhishthira said, "brother Bhima! These people have come to our shelter and it is the religion of the Kshatriyas to protect those who come in the asylum
 phir dusht swabhaav kaa hone ke baad bhi duryodhana aakhir hamaara bhai hi he
 The Raj women with him are women of our own clan and due to their disrespect, our clan will suffer
 isaliye uchit yahi he ki tum or arjuna jaakar unki raksha karo
 By obeying his elder brother, Bhima and Arjuna approached the lake and challenged Chitraratha to battle
 unki lalkaar sunakar chitrarath krodhit hone ke bajaay muskuraate huye arjuna ke paas aaye or bole, “he parth! main to tumhaara sakha hi hoon
 In fact, the evil Duryodhana came here with his army to kill you
 devraj indra ko is baat kii soochna mil chuki thi isaliye unhone mujhe yahan bheja tha
 Hey friend! The policy says that such wicked should never be forgiven, but by obeying your elder brother, if you want to redeem Duryodhana, then i leave it and the ladies with it now
 ” itnaa kahkar chitrarath ne duryodhana sahit samast kaidiyon ko mukt kar diya
 They all came to Dharmaraja Yudhishthira from there

 Some people consider the blood-delivery network to be the vasculature only, while others include the lymphatic system as well
 maanav evam anya kasheruk praaniyon ke parisancharan tantra, 'band parisancharan tantra' hai 
 The circulatory system of invertebrates is the 'open circulatory system'
 bahut se tuchh main parisancharan tantra hota hi nahin
 But the lymphatic system of all beings is an open system
 vahikaatantr hriday, dhamniyon tathaa shiraaon ke samooh kaa naam he
 a wide group of capillaries between the arteries and veins is also part of this system
 is tantra kaa kaam sharir ke prayek bhaag main rudhir ko pahunchaana he, jisase use poshan or oxigen praapt ho saken
 The center of this system is the heart, which keeps the blood pumping continuously, and the arteries are the vessels through which the blood reaches the organs and is distributed by capillaries
 keshikaon ke rudhir se poshan or oxigen utakon main chale jate hai or is poshan or oxigen se viheen rudhir ko ve shira main lautaakar hriday main laati hai jo usko phupfus main oxigen lene ke liye bhej detaa he
 Nutrients are also absorbed into the blood after being absorbed from the bowel, and again this blood is sent by the arteries to carry oxygen and nutrition to the organs

 There is a dividing board between the right and left side cells, which does not allow the blood on both sides to meet
 prayek ore ek koshth upar he, jo alind kehalaata he or neeche kaa koshth nilay kaha jaataa he
 In the right ventricle, there are two holes in the upper half of the apex, through which blood returns to the heart
 ek bada chhidr alind or nilay ke bich main hai, jisapar kapatika lagi hui he
 At the time of contraction of the heart, the atrophy of the atrium opens towards the ventricle, causing the blood to enter the ventricle
 daahine nilay main phupfusi dhamni kaa bhi chhidr he
 On narrowing of the ventricle, the blood passes into the pleura, which occurs in the pulmonary artery
 isi prakaar bai ore bhi upar alind he or neeche nilay
 In the left ventricle there are four pus venous holes, by which the purified blood in the pleura comes back and when the atrium is secreted, it goes into the ventricle by the hole between the ventricle and the atrium
 bai ore ke is chhidr par bhi kapatika lagi hui he
 There is a perforation of the aorta in the left ventricle, from which the blood flows out into the aorta and by its multiple branches communicates throughout the body, returning by the veins and then back to the right atrium of the heart
 ye bade mahatv kii sanrachanaayen hai, jo rudhir ko keval ek maarg se agrasar hone detii hai, lautne nahin deteen
 The right side capillary is made up of three caudal parts and is called the trivalon capillary
 bai ore dwivalan kapatika he
 On the side of the ventricle, there are fine fibers similar to those of the rope, the other end of which are on the shoots coming out of the ventricular wall
 ye condaryrajju kehalaate hai or ankuron ko peplia peshi kaha jaataa he
 When the atrium is filled with blood in the ventricle due to the atrial fibrillation, when it narrows, the blood reaches behind the cords and raises them towards the holes, so that their ends meet together to stop the passage of the hole and the blood does not return to the atrium
 Finds
 peplia peshi bhi sankuchit ho jaati hai, jisase condaryrajju tan jaati he or kapaticaon ke kapard alind main ulatney nahin pate
 With this type of management, the blood can move in only one direction, from the atrium to the ventricle
 phupfusi or mahadhamani ke chhidron par bhi ardhachandrakaar kapatikaay lagi hui hai
 It is clear from the above description that the hemisphere comes in the right atrium
 vahaan se hritsankunchan ke samay nilay main jaataa he
 After narrowing of the ventricle, the pleura passes into the pleural artery
 vahaan oxigen lekar, rudhir chaar phupfusi shiraaon dwaara baayein alind main jaataa he or uske sankuchan karne par rudhir baayein nilay main chalaa jaataa he
 When narrowing in the left ventricle, the blood advances into the aorta
 is dhamni kii shakhaayen, jinka neeche ullekh kiya gaya he, sharir main faili hui hai
 Blood circulates through them in the capillaries and through the capillaries, veins then return to the right part of the heart and then the same cycle begins
 yahi rudhir parisancharan kehalaata he
 The heart itself has the power to contract
 vah prati minute 72 baar sankuchan karata he, arthath ek baar sankuchan main 0
8 second lagata he
 During this period, the atrial contraction takes place for 0
1 second, the remaining 0
7 seconds remains in a relaxed state

 This is called branching
 hriday se nikalanevaali do mukhya dhamni hai, phuffusi or mahadhamani
 After the pulmonary artery exits the right ventricle, it divides into two branches and one branch goes into each pleural
 is dhamni kaa prayojan oxigen lene ke liye rudhir ko phuffus main pahunchaana he
 After going out of the left ventricle of the heart, go first to the right, then backwards, then to the left, where the fourth thorax reaches the left side of the vertebra and goes straight down to the end of the thoracic descending
 is prakaar prarambh main iskaa jo mode banataa he, vah mahadhamani chaap kehalaata he
 At the end of the thorax, by passing through the ventral muscle, reaching the fourth lumbar vertebrae, crossing the entire abdomen, the two common series pane terminates by dividing the arteries

 Veins have a similar structure to the wall, but their thickness is much less than that of the arteries
 mansapeshi utak visheshtya kam hota he or jahaan tahaan antarkala str kii vruddhi se kapatikaay ban jaati hai
 There are usually two cupards in the capillaries, although somewhere three and one are also found, the cupards are similar to the sac, which is located in the path of the vein in such a way that if the blood starts returning, these bags are filled
 That is, they swell and close the path
 vahikaatantr kaa ek mahatvapurn avyav keshikas kehalaata he
 a group of capillaries is located between the arteries and veins

 TQM is a term derived from the Japanese policy, Total Quality Control 

, This policy was the conclusion of quality assurance
 Since then it has been respected as a new paradigm
 aaj TQM sabhi udyog vyapaar va gatividhiyon main lagu kiya jaataa he
 Whether a hotel or a hospital, an educational institution or an engineering institute, a paan shop or a park, whether it is a lawyer's office or an advisory tool for aircraft maintenance

 TQM takes the basic concept of adopting quality in transformative processes in the beginning and this idea was proposed by the quality guru William Edward Deming
 Deming series feedback to maintain design quality early and excel Advocates systematically applying the total quality principle to achieve
 When every process from raw material to good design and resources is done and the product comes in very good and continuous form of better finished product then it is said It is known that TQM is on

 The joy provided by the orchestra or the fife is like that
 Above all it provides sustainable development at a fast pace

 The set of gross works related to dictionary formation is called koshakarma or lexicography
 vishyon kii drushti se shabdkoshon ke varg yaa vibhaag bananaa kathin he
 Different Kokhars used to create such subjects according to their understanding
 unka na to koi nishchit kram hota tha or na ho hi saktaa tha
 So people often had to memorize the entire dictionary
 isi kaaran paashchaatya deshon main shabdkosh aksharkram se banane lage
 There was no need to rote such a dictionary and he could use it as and when required
 aajkal praaia: sabhi deshon or sabhi bhashaaon main kosh ke kshetra me isi kram ko prayog hone laga he : jo jigyaasu kii drushti se sabase adhik subhite kaa hota hai
 That's why alphabet is often used in all types of thesaurus
 yon to kosh ke anek prakaar hote hai, par arth ke vichaar se ve do bhaagon main baante ja sakate hai
 One is those in which meanings and interpretations of the words of a language are in the same language and other in which the meanings of the words of one language are given in another language or languages
 vishay ke vichaar se kosh anek prakaar ke ho sakate hai, jaise-ganit kosh, vidhik kosh, vaidyak kosh, sahitya kosh aadi
 Such dictionaries are often counted in terms such as agricultural terminology, southern terminology, geographical terminology etc
 inke sivaa kuch vishisht kaviyon, boliyon aadi ke bhi alag alag kosh hote hai, jaise-tulsi kosh, sur kosh, avadhi kosh, brajabhasha kosh aadi
 The main symbols, topics or words that contain thesaurus or tables in important texts of a particular subject are called successive metaphorical index, subject index or concordance
 koshrachana ek kala he
 Knowledge of this art can be obtained by studying the dictionaries of the most advanced languages of the present era with a subtle view
 achche or pramanik koshon kaa sampadan tab tak keval vidwata ke bal par nahin ho saktaa, jab tak koshrachana kii kala kaa bhi puraa puraa gyaan na ho or is kala kaa gyaan koshon ke jivanavyapee adhyayan se hi ho saktaa he
 All types of thesaurus are made only for the fulfillment of a particular purpose and the need of a particular area
 at: koshrachana main mukhyat: isi uddeshy yaa aavashyaktaa kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa hai
 Secondly, one has to keep in mind that his entire body is balanced in all respects; It is not that an organ grows more than it needs or justification, and someone seems to be weak or inferior in comparison
 shabdon kaa vivechan bhi or us vivechan ke angon kaa kram bhi sadaa ek sa rahanaa chahie
 Words also have castes or classes, so all the words of a caste or class should have the same interpretation
 yadi pramanik granthon athwa lekhakon ke udhaaharan liye jaae, to unka utana hi ansh lenaa chahie, jitne main aashay spasht ho sake or jigyaasu kaa samaadhaan ho jaae
 Good dictionaries also contain terminology for all types of fields and subjects
 isaliye sampadak kaa adhik se adhik vishyon kaa saamaanya gyaan yaa bodh hona chahie
 When needed, it is necessary to seek help from a good and authentic book of an unknown or new subject or even from a good writer
 koshrachana ke kaary main drushti bahut vyapak rakhana chahie or vritti madhukaari honi chahie
 The vision should be so sharp and subtle that it can easily make sense of Neer Ksheer and by finding old errors, faults, mistakes, etc
, it can be easily corrected and corrected
 koshkar main pakshpaat yaa rogadwesh naam ko bhi nahin rahanaa chahie
 Its sole purpose should be to serve language and literature
 koshon main pradhanta arthon or vivechanon kii hi hoti he, at: unamem kahin vyapti yaa ativyapti nahin rahani chahie
 All things should be brief, nappy and moderate as much as possible
 kosh main adhik se adhik or thos jaankaree kam se kam shabdon main prastut karke hi jaani chahie
 There is no place in the dictionary for unnecessary or recruitment matters
 shabdon ke kuch rup to maanak hote hai or bahut se rup sthanik yaa prantiy hote hai
 The spatial or provincial words of which the standard forms are received should be interpreted within the same standard words and their standard or provincial forms should be mere reference to their standard forms
 isse bahut bada laabh yah hota he ki anya bhashaa-bhashiyon ko sahaj main shabdon ke maanak rup kaa pataa chal jaataa he or bhashaa kaa maanak rup sthir hone main sahaayta milti he-aparichiton ke dwaara bhashaa kaa rup sahasaa bigadane nahin paata
 The same thing should be done with regard to Sanskrit words which have many synonyms
 jaise camel, nadi, parvat, samudr aadi
 While giving their synonyms in front of words, it should also be kept in mind that only those synonyms should be given the exact meaning or measure of the original word
 jin paryaayon ke kaaran kuch bhi bhram utpann ho saktaa ho, un paryaayon kaa aise prasangon main parityag karnaa hi shreyaskar hoga
 Recently, Webster's New World Dictionary has set a new model in front of lexicographers, which is very useful and useful for dictionaries, because they are very exemplary
 usamen anek shabdon ke antargat unase milte julate paryaayon ke sookshm antar bhi dikhalaae gaye hai, yatha - feare ke antargat dred, friete, elarm, disme, teror or painic ke sookshm antar bhi batala die gaye hai
 It has been done in such a way that the work of the lexicon is not finished by conveying the meaning of the words, but even beyond this, its job is to tell people the correct use of the words
 hamaare yahan aise saikadon hajaaron shabd milenge, jinke parsparik sookshm antar batalaaye ja sakate hai or is prakaar jigyaasuon ko shabdon par nae dhang se vichaar karne kaa abhyaas karaayaa ja saktaa he
 There is another new and useful practice in recent good and big English dictionaries, which can be particularly useful for Indian language dictionaries
 praaia: sabhi bhashaaon main bahut se aise yogic shabd hote hai jo upsarg lagaakar bana liye jate hai
 Junior to Junior, Causal to Indeterminate, Expected to Unexpected, Necessary to Unnecessary, Minister to Deputy Minister, Committee to Subcommittee, Adherence to Compliance, Excursion from Cruise, Reaction to Karma, Legislation from Legislation etc
 upsargon ke yoga se bananevaale aise shabdon kii sankhya bahut adhik hoti he
 Such words are divided into two classes or can be divided
 ek to aise shabd jinke shabd purv pad tathaa uttar pad mil kar bhi kisi nae yaa vishisht arth se yukt nahin hote or isi liye saadhaaran shabdon ke antargat rahete hai
 Such words and their meanings greatly increase the level of the dictionary
 is prakaar ke vyarth vistaar se bachane ke liye webster ke nae koshon main yah nai paddati apanaai gai he ki unhen swatantra shabd nahin maanate or isi liye unke arth bhi nahin liye gaye hai
 At the end of the page, a list of such words is given below a line, as-un-destined, un-disturbed, un-free, un-hurt, un-invoked etc
 haan, inke vipareet duusare varg ke kuch aise shabd avashya hote hai jinamein upsargon ke yoga se kuch nae arth nikalate hai
 As in the adjective form, the form of Achcha is hairless, but in noun form it is also a name for the planet Ketu
 anagaar kaa arth bina ghar-barwaala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah sanyasi kaa bhi vaachak he
 Therefore it is necessary to take such words
 jin shabdon ke arth purvpad or utaarpad ke yoga se swat: nasht ho jate hon, unhen koshon main arthsahit lenaa vyarth hi samajha jane laga he
 Therefore, it would be sufficient to just give a list of such words in the page
 haan, jin yogic shabdon main donon padon ke yoga se koi nayaa or vishesh arth nikalataa ho, unhen yathasthaan arthsahit lenaa to aavashyak he hi
 The method of our old Sanskrit dictionary has been that the words formed by the sum of ati, prati, etc
 are given together under the same title under their former term
 hindi ke kuch koshon ne bhi is pratha kaa anukaran kiya he
 Although this method is rational from the point of view of Sanskrit grammar, even in Sanskrit dictionaries, it does not appear to be fully followed
 isamen sthaan kii kuch bachat avashya hoti he, par asaadhaaran pathakon ke liye shabd dhoondhna bahut kathin ho jaataa he
 Sometimes it is difficult to find words from this method even for people who are very familiar with its rules and principles
 prayek bhashaa main kuch shabd aise hote hai jo alag alag arthon ke vichaar se avyay, kriyavisheshan, visheshan, pratyay sangya aadi bhi hote hai or alag alag mulon se bhi vyutpann hote hen, yatha hindi ko aan shabd sangya bhi he, visheshan bhi or pratyay bhi
 In its noun form, it is derived from a few different origins in many of its meanings
 aise shabd aadhunik or shreshth angareji koshon main alag or swatantra shabd maane jate hai or unke alag alag sheershak rakhkar unka vivechan kiya jaataa he, yatha-angareji main waayiz visheshan bhi he, sangya bhi or pratyay bhi or teenon roopon main uske sheershak alag alag rakhe gaye hai
 If they are also followed in the lexicons of Indian languages, it will be very good in many respects

 Several months ago on 6 December 1907, this special day was organized by Mrs
 Grace Golden Clayton in honor of the 210 fathers killed in a mine accident in Monongaah, West Virginia
 pratham fadars de carch aaj bhi central united methodist carch ke naam se fairmont main maujuud he
 Due to misinformation and West Virginia not registering the first Father's Day as a holiday, many other sources believe that the first Father's Day was held on June 19, 1910, two years after the efforts of Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington 
 1909 main spoka ke central methodist episkopel carch ke bishap dwaara haal hi main manyata praapt madars de par die gaye ek dharmaupadesh ko sunne ke baad, dod ko laga ki pitadharm ko bhi avashya manyata milani chahie
 ve apane pita wiliam smart jaise anya pitaaon ke sammaan main utsav yojit karnaa chaahati thim, jo ek sevanivrutt sainik the tathaa jinhone chathe bachche ke janm ke samay, jab sonora 16 varsh kii thi, apni patni kii mrityu ke baad apane parivaar kii akele parvarish kii thi, The following year, Sonora took the idea to the Spokane YMCA with the help of Dr
 Conrad Bluhm, pastor of Old Centenary Presbyterian Church
 spoka vyaimasie tathaa ministerial allins ne dod ke is vichaar kaa samarthan kiya or 1910 main pratham fadars de manaa kar iskaa prachaar kiya
 Sonora suggested that her father's birthday should be fixed on June 5 to honor all fathers
 Since the clergy wanted some more time to prepare for it, on 19 June 1910, the young members of the YMCA went to church with roses, red roses in honor of the living father and white roses in honor of the deceased father
 Dodd traveled around the city in a horse-drawn carriage and distributed gifts to the fathers who were left in their homes due to illness
 ise aadhikarik chuttee banane main kai saal lag gaye
 Despite the support of the YMCA, YWCA and the Church, there was a fear of Father's Day disappearing from the calendar
 Where Mother's Day was celebrated with enthusiasm, Father's Day was laughed off
 Gradually, the holiday was supported but for the wrong reasons
 It became an object of satire, parody and derision, including jokes from the local newspaper
 bahut se logon ne ise calendar ko vichaarheen protsaahan se bharne ke pehle kadam ke rup main dekha
 In 1913, a bill was introduced in Congress to give national recognition to the holiday
 san 1916 main, raashtrapati woodro wilson ek fadars de samaaroh main bhaashan dene spoka gayi to ve ise aadhikarik bananaa chaahate the kintu iske vyavsyeekaran ke dar se congress ne iskaa virodh kiya
 In 1924, US President Calvin Coolidge recommended that the day be celebrated by the entire nation but stopped its national announcement
 The Congress had rejected two attempts to formalize the holiday
 1957 main, main seenetter margret chej smith ne congress par mata-pita main se pita ko akelaa chhod kar, sirf maataaon kaa sammaan karke 40 saal tak pita kii andekhi karne kaa aarope lagaate hue ek prastaav likhaa
 1966 main, raashtrapati lindon johnson ne pratham raashtrapatiya ghoshnaa jari kar june maheene ke tisare ravivaar ko pitaaon ke sammaan main, fadars de ke rup main tay kiya

 The purpose of this council was to make this holiday valid in the minds of the people and to promote this holiday like a business program to increase sales on the holiday
 This council has always had the support of Dodd, who had no problem with the commercialization of the holiday, and he supported several incentives to increase the amount of gifts
 is pahalu se dod ko enna jarvis ke ulat mana ja saktaa he jinhone madars de ke sabhi tarah ke vyavsaayeekaran kaa virodh kiya tha
 Merchants mocked the holiday itself by promoting the tendency to copy and satirize the holiday
 Realizing the commercial appearance, people were forced to buy gifts and the custom of giving gifts on that day became progressively more acceptable
 1937 main fadars de parishad ne gananaa kii ki is din chah main se keval ek pita ko hi uphaar miltaa tha
 However, by the 1980s, the council announced that they had achieved their goals — the one-day program had turned into a three-week commercial event as a "second Christmas"
 iske kaaryakari nideshak ne 1949 main kaha tha ki parishad evam use samarthan dene vaale samoohon ke samanvit prayaason ke bina yah chuttee gaayab ho gai hoti
 Although the name of this program is usually understood as a plural, the spelling should generally be "fathers' Day" but the most common spelling is "father's Day", as if it were a word
 In the United States, Dodd used the spelling "fathers' Day" in his original application for leave, but the spelling "father's Day" had been in vogue since 1913 when the US Congress, as the first attempt to establish the holiday, The bill was introduced for the first time in the US and the same spelling continued until 2008 when its parent was honored by the American Congress

 'bajirao Mastani' is an Indian historical romance film directed and produced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 film maratha samrajya ke peshwa bajirao or uski duusari patni mastaani ke bare main bataati he
 Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone have both played the lead characters, Priyanka Chopra plays Bajirao's first wife and Tanvi Azmi plays Bajirao's mother
 bajirao mastaani 18 disambar 2015 ko release hui he
 Bajirao Mastani film starts with the making of new Peshwa, Bajirao is chosen for this, after which people of all empires celebrate in this happiness
 phir achaanak bundelkhand se mastaani sahaayta ke liye aati he or bajirao ke sainikon se ladakar sidhe bajirao se milti he or unako manaakar bundelkhand le jaati he vahaan wo vahaan par pratidwindeeyon se donon milakar yuddh karte he or vahaan par vijay praapt karte hai
 After this, Bajirao celebrates Holi in Bundelkhand, meanwhile, Bajirao and Mastani fall in love
 duusare din bajirao waapas pune chale jate hai
 Meanwhile, while leaving, Bajirao gives his dagger to Mastani, due to which he gets married to a dagger in Bundelkhand, under this tradition Mastani goes to Pune
 vahaan par wo bajirao kii mata radhabai se milti he
 Radhabai does not want Mastani, because of this she starts hating
 iske baad chimaji appa shanivarwara dikhaate he tathaa isamen adbhut aainamahal bhi dikhaate hai
 When Mastani asks Radha Bai to accept the relationship, she gives it to Ghungroo and says that since now your relationship has been done, from now on you will dance in the festival
 phir satara se chhatrapati sahu kaa bulaava aata he tab bajirao vahaan jate he phir radhabai ek nai chaal chalati he or mastaani ko ghunghru dekar bhej detii he lekin mastaani vahaan pahunchakar ghunghru chhatrapati sahu ke saamne ghunghru rakh detii he is kaaran pant pratinidhi mehafil kaa apmaan maanate he lekin jab chhatrapati sahu ko pataa chalata he ki wo raja chhatrasaal kii beti he to wo inhen waapas jane ke liye kha dete he or bolte he ki tumhen kya chahie tab mastaani bolti he ki maine bajirao se ishq kiya he bajirao chahie
 After this Mastani waits for Bajirao when a storm comes and Bajirao comes there and marries Mastani
 isi bich kashibai ko bhi pataa chal jaataa he or wo bhi naaraaz ho jaati he
 Then Kashibai and Mastani have sons and are named
 kashibai ke putr kaa naam raghunatha rakhte he jabaki mastaani ke putr kaa naam samsher bahadur naam rakh dete hai
 Meanwhile, a fight ensues between Bajirao and Chimaji Appa
 bajirao sabhi se kahata he ki wo saptami ke din mastaani ko shanivarwara laaenge parantu krishnabhat or radhabai ye nahin karne ko kehete hai
 The film is based on Rau, an excellent historical novel by well-known Marathi novelist Nagnath Inamdar
 yah upanyaas marathi hi nahin balki sampurna bhartiya bhashaaon ke saphaltam aitihaasik upanyaason main se ek he
 In this, excellent prolificity has been introduced while protecting both history and historiography
 is upanyaas main swaabhaavik rup se bharpoor naatakeeyata vidyaman he or padhate hue aisa lagata he jaise koi uttam dharawahik dekh rahe hon
 Its descriptive scenes are also engraved on the psyche like movie scenes
 aise upanyaas par aadhaarit hone se film main anek visheshtaayen swaabhaavik rup se aa gayi hai
 This story has shone even further by a proven director like Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 film main paathya rachana se kuch antar aa janaa to swaabhaavik hi rahata he kyonki donon ke madhyam bhinn hote hai, parantu is film main kuch antar jaanboojhkar filmi latakon-jhatkon ke rup main laaye gayi hai, jisase itihaas-bodh ko dhakka pahunchaa he
 In the early scenes, the scene appointing Bajirao as Peshwa is also very good and appropriate, and despite being outside the novel, it is completely consistent with the historicity and sense of history; But the scene in which Kashibai's old friend, whose husband Peshwa is killed due to Bajirao and therefore curses her husband by leaving her ashes there, has made a clear distinction
 upanyaas main kashibai kii kushal gruhinee ke rup main garimamayi upasthiti he, jabaki film main kashibai ko chanchal kishori kii taraf uchhalte dikhalaakar itihaas bodh ko khandit kar diya gaya he
 The filmmaker has also forgotten that the son of Kashibai, who is filming like this, is getting young and he was the main doer of that festival
 yahan kashibai peshwa kii patni na lag kar filmi heroin 'priyanka chopra' hi lagati he
 The carrying of Bajirao by army with the help of Chhatrasal has also become absolutely historic
 dekhne main bahut rochak he, lekin mastaani ke dwaara aisa na to hua tha, na ho saktaa tha
 Even leaving aside such minor scenes, the filmmaker has made two unforgivable mistakes - Srimanta Bajirao Peshwa and Kashibai have been caught at different times
 us yug main or peshwa parivaar main kashibai jaisi stri, jo ek tarah se rani hi thi, yadi naachati hoti to nartkiyon ko vishesh rup se rakhane kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin hoti
 The special thing in that too is that at the time when Kashibai is danced with Mastani in the film, the pain in her foot was increased even more in those days
 mastaani se kashibai kii bhent bhi bilkul bhinn tareeke kii or filmi latakon-jhatkon vaali ho gayi he
 Therefore, for the sake of creative enjoyment with historicity, the above novel has to be read, but the film has done the task of taking the extraordinary love story and great life of Mahan Bajirao Peshwa and Mastani to people outside of Maharashtra as well, for this film The filmmaker definitely deserves thanks
 lagbhag sabhi kalakaaron kaa abhinay bhi jivant evam prashansaneey he, jo film ko baar-baar dekhne ke liye prerit karata he
 In the year 2003, Sanjay Leela Bhansali selected Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai for the lead character of this film
 jo unki film ham dil de chuke sanam main bhi mukhya kirdaar main the

 This rebellion lasted for two years in different regions of India
 is vidroh kaa aarambh chhavnee kshetron main choti jhadpon tathaa aagjanee se hua tha parantu janvari maas tak isane ek bada rup le liya
 The end of the revolt coincided with the end of the East India Company's rule in India and the British Crown's direct rule over the whole of India began for the next 90 years
 east india company ne robert clive ke netritv main san 1757 main plasi kaa yuddh jeeta
 In the post-war treaty, the British got the right to tax-free trade in Bengal
 san 1764 main baxur kaa yuddh jeetne ke baad angrejon kaa bengal par puri tarah se adhikaar ho gaya
 The victory in these two wars greatly increased the strength of the British and proved their military capability superior to the traditional Indian military capability
 company ne iske baad saare bharat par apana prabhaav failaana aarambh kar diya
 In 1843, the East India Company took possession of the Sindh region after a bloody battle
 san 1839 main maharaja ranjit singh kii mrityu ke baad kamjor hue punjab par angrejon ne apana haath badhaaya or san 1848 main doosraa angrej-sikh yuddh hua
 In 1849, the company also took control of Punjab
 san 1853 main aakhri maratha peshwa baaji raav ke dattak putr naanaa sahib kii padavi chin lee gayi or unka vaarshik kharchaa band kar diya gaya
 Berar in 1854 and Awadh were merged with the Company in 1856
 san 1857 ke vidroh ke vibhinn rajnatik, aarthik, dharmik, sainik tathaa saamaajik kaaran bataaye jate he Many historians believe that there was a belief in the public at that time that the British want to Christianize them by force or deception
 yah puri tarah se galat bhi nahin tha, kuch company adhikari dharm parivartan ke kaary main jute the
 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he
 Earlier, one of the reasons for the decline of the Portuguese from India and Japan in the sixteenth century was that they had tried to force Christianity on the masses
 lord dalhousie kii rajya hadapney kii naati ke antargat anek rajya jaise jhansi, avadh, satara, nagpur or sambalpur ko angreji rajya main mila liya gaya or inke uttaradhikari raja se angreji rajya se pension paane vaale karmchaaree ban gayi
 The royal families, zamindars and armies found themselves unemployed and marginalized
 ye log angrejon ke haathon apni sharmindagi or haar kaa badla lene ke liye taiyaar the
 In the eight years of Lord Dalhousie's rule, the area of one million square miles was taken over by the company
 iske atirikt east india company kii bengal sena main bahut se sipaahi avadh se bhartee hote the, ve avadh main hone vaali ghatnaon se achoote nahin rah sake
 The event, which was spoken in Calcutta by the royal family of Nagpur, was seen as a disrespect to the royal family
 bhartiya, company ke kathor shashan se bhi naaraaz the jo ki teji se fail rahaa tha or pashchimi sabhyta kaa prasar kar rahaa tha
 The British outlawed many of the customs of Hindus and Muslims at that time which were considered antisocial by the British
 isamen sati pratha par roak lagaana shaamil tha
 It is worth noting here that the Sikhs had stopped this long ago and the famous social reformer of Bengal, King Rammohan Roy was campaigning in favor of discontinuing the practice
 in kanoonon ne samaaj ke kuch pakshon mukhyatah bengal main krodh utpann kar diya
 The British abolished child marriage and also prohibited female feticide
 angrejon dwaara thagi kii samaapti bhi kii gai parantu yah sandeh abhi bhi bana hua he ki thag ek dharmik samudaay tha yaa keval saadhaaran dakaiton kaa samudaay
 The British judicial system was considered unjust to Indians
 san 1853 main britain ke pradhanmantri lord abradin ne prashasnic seva ko bharatiyon ke liye khol diya parantu kuch prabud bharatiyon ke hisaab se yah sudhaar paryaapt nahin tha
 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy
 in nitiyon ke kaaran bahut se kisaan, karigar, shramik or kalakaar kangaal ho gayi
 Along with them the situation of the landlords and big farmers also got worse
 san 1813 main company ne ek tarafa mukt vyapaar kii niti apana lee iske antargat britani vyapaariyon ko aayaat karne kii puri chhot mil gayi, paramparaagat takanic se bani hui bhartiya vasteen iske saamne tik nahin saki or bhartiya shahari hastshilp vyapaar ko acolpaneey kshati hui
 With the arrival of the railway service, small enterprises in the rural areas were also destroyed
 rail seva ne britani vyapaariyon ko dur daraaj ke gaavon tak pahunch de di
 The textile industry suffered the most
 iske saath loha vyapaar, bartan, kaanch, kaagaj, dhaatu, bandook, jahaaj or rangareji ke udyogon ko bhi bahut kshati hui
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Indian exports came to an end due to import tax and many barriers in Britain and Europe
 parmparik udyogon ke nasht hone or saath saath aadhunik udyogon kaa vikaas na hone kii kaaran yah sthiti or bhi visham ho gayi
 The general public has no means other than farming
 kheti karne vaale kisaano kii haalat bhi kharaab thi
 In the beginning of British rule, the peasants were left at the mercy of the zamindars, who greatly increased the rent and started exploiting the peasants by forced labor and other methods
 company ne kheti ke sudhaar par bahut kam kharch kiya or adhiktar lagaan company ke kharchon ko puraa karne main prayog hota tha
 In the event of crop failure, the moneylenders loaned the farmers more interest and cheated the illiterate farmers in many ways
 britani kanoon vyavastha ke antargat bhoomi hastantaran vaid ho jane ke kaaran kisaanon ko apni bhoomi se bhi haath dhonaa padataa tha
 Due to these problems there was dissatisfaction among every section of the society
 san 1848 or 1856 ke bich lard dalhoji ne doctrin ouf laps ke kanoon ke antargat anek rajyon par adhikaar kar liya
 According to this theory, a state, territory or area of british influence will become subject to the company, if the king of the region dies without permission or the ruler is disqualified in the eyes of the company
 is siddhant par kaary karte hue lard dalhoji or uske uttaradhikari lard cannig ne satara,nagpur,jhansi,avadh ko company ke shashan main mila liya
 Political credibility of the company was also questioned due to the treaties and promises made by the company
 san 1849 main lard dalhoji kii ghoshnaa ke anusaar bahadur shah ke uttaradhikari ko aitihaasik laal kila chhodana padega or shahar ke baahar janaa hoga or san 1856 main lard cannig kii ghoshnaa ki bahadur shah ke uttaradhikari raja nahin kahalaayenge ne mughalon ko company ke vidroh main khada kar diya
 The soldiers were originally soldiers of Indian origin who worked in the company's Bengal Army
 bombay, madras or bengal presidensi kii apni alag sena or senapramukh hota tha
 This army had more soldiers than the British army
 san 1857 main is sena main 2,57,000 sipaahi the
 The army of Bombay and Madras Presidency, being a people of different regions, these forces were full of diversity and did not have the dominion of the people of any one region
 parantu bengal presidensi kii sena main bhartee hone vaale sainik mukhyat: avadh or ganga ke maidani ilaako ke bhoomihaar brahman or rajput the
 In the early years of the company, caste privileges and customs were given importance in the Bengal Army, but after 1840, after the coming of modern government in Calcutta, there was a fear of losing the caste among the soldiers
 sena main sipaahiyon ko jati or dharm se sambandhit chinh pahanane se manaa kar diya gaya
 In 1856, under an order, all newly recruited soldiers were made mandatory to work abroad for some time
 sipaahi dhire-dhire sena ke jivan ke vibhinn pahaluon se asantusht ho chuke the
 The salary of the army was low
 bhartiya sainikon kaa vetan mahaj saat rupaye pratimah tha
 And after winning Awadh and Punjab the sepoys' allowance was also abolished
 enfield bandook ke bare main faili afvaahon ne sipaahiyon kii ashnka ko or badhaa diya ki company unki dharm or jati parivartan karnaa chaahati he
 The revolt began due to a gun
 sipaahiyon ko pattesion 1853 enfield bandook di gayin jo ki 0
577 calibar kii bandook thi tathaa puraani or kai dashakon se upyog main laayi ja rahi brown bas ke mukaable main shaktishaalee or achook thi
 The modern system of firing in the new gun was used, but the process of firing in the gun was old

 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he

 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai

 Dandi is a famous Sanskrit litterateur
 inke jivan ke sambandh main pramanik soochnaaon kaa abhaav he
 Some scholars consider them to be late seventh or early eighth century, while some scholars consider them to be born between 550 and 650 AD
 dandi kab hue or inaki rachanaayen koun koun si hai, yah prashn ab bhi vivaadaaspad he
 His biography is also not particularly known
 dakshin bharat main uplabdh 'avantisundari katha' or 'avantisundari kathasaar' -- in donon ke aadhaar par unke jivan ke vishay main itnaa hi gyaat ho sakaa he ki dandi ke prapitamah damodar pandit the
 He was probably a friend of Bharvi
 unheen kii sahaayta se chalukyavanshi raja vishnuvardhan ke nikat pahunch sake
 Dandi was born in Bharvi's fourth generation
 kanchinaresh ke aashray main inkaa jivan vyateet hua
 Seeing the considerable influence of Dandi's 'kavyadarsha' on the Kankaraj 'kavraj Marg' of the Kannada language and finding the Sinhalese ornamentation 'siy-bus-lakar' built on Kavadarsha basis, it is certain that Dandi existed before the ninth century
 is prakaar 'lakshm lakshmin tanotiti' is uddhran ke kalidas ke ek prasiddh padyansh par ashrith hone se dandi kaa kaal asandigdh rup se kalidas ke pashchaat thahartaa he
 With the view of Prof
 Pathak, the subject should be designed after 650 A
D
, because the subject for the study is on the basis of recruitment
 kavyadarshokt rajverma ko narsinghverma dwitiya kaa virud yaa upnaam maananevaalon ke anusar dandi kaa samay saatvin shatee kaa uttarardh or aathvin kaa aarambh mana ja saktaa he
 If the effect of Kadambari's Shukanashopadesh on one verse of 'kavyadarsha' is accepted, then its period - Banabhatta is also different
 avantisundari kathasaar ko dandi kii kriti maananevaalon ke mat se bhi uparyukt kathan kii pushti hoti he
 But some scholars consider Dandi to be earlier than Subandhu and some people are also predecessors of Banabhatta
 dwitiya mat waalon ke anusaar subandhu, dandi or baan -- teenon hi 550 itho or 650 itho ke bich utpanan hue the
 There is an objection in the opinion of these people to consider 'avantisundari Katha' or 'kathasar' as punitive
 kinvadanti or subhashit ke anusaar dandi kii teen rachanaayen vishrut bataai gai hai
 The first composition is 'kavyadarsha' and the second is 'dasakumarcharit'
 adhiktar vidwaanon ne yah maan liya he, parantu kuch anya vidvan -- in donon ko ek sahityakar kii na maanakar dandi naam ke do bhinn vyaktiyon kii rachana hone kaa anumaan karte hai
 One of the main reasons for this is that the valid principles of poetry which are rendered and instructed in 'poetry', its inconsistency and opposition are seen in 'dasakumarcharit'
 at: acharya or kavyakaar ke siddhant or vyavhaar kii asangati ek nahin do bhinn kritikaron kaa sanket karti he
 But according to most scholars, the reason for the above inconsistency has been assumed that in the beginning of his literary life, Mahakavi composed 'dasakumarcharit'
 'kavyadarsh' us praudhavastha kii rachana he jab dandi kaa shastreey vaidushya paripakv ho gaya tha
 Therefore, most scholars have no opposition in considering these two works as punishable
 parantu teesri kriti kaa nirdhaaran ab tak vivaadaaspad he
 'mritchkatik', which is called Shudrakarchit by the opinion of 'pirol', is the third composition of Dandi
 iskaa ek aadhaar 'kavyadarsh' main bina kisi naam ke 'mrichctic' kii ek pankti kaa uddhran he
 The second reason is the extreme coherence in the characterization of the society and their characters depicted in both 'mrchchakatik' and 'daskumarcharit'
 pratham kaaran koi mahatvapurn kaaran nahin he
 The second only informs that both works are often trying to portray real-time and vibrant depictions of contemporary society
 'mallikamarut' bhi kabhi kabhi dandikrut kaha jaataa he
 But it is a work of 15th century 'udand Ranganath'
 'avantisundarikatha' ko ab anek vidvan 'dashakumarcharit' kii kathaon ke samya par dandi kii tritiy rachana maanane lage hai
 Seeing the stylistic differences between the two prose, some pundits have objected to it being punished
 par anya vidvan yuvavastha kii style main 'dashakumarcharit' ko virachit or praudhavastha kii paripakv style main 'avantisundarikatha' kaa nirmaan maanakar ise bhi asandigdh rup main dandi kii tritiy rachana sweekaar karte hai
 Some people have started to consider 'avantisundarikatha' as a lost former chair of 'daskumar Charitha'
 'dashakumarcharit' sanskrit ke teen prasiddh gadhykavyon main ek mahatvapurn or prasiddh kriti he
 He is written in the style of poetry
 'mahabhashya' or pracheen upanishdon kii sahaj gadhyshailee, 'hitopadesh' aadi kii nitisahityavali subodh or vyaavhaarik gadhyshailee kii tulana main dashakumarcharit kii bhashastyli adhik saahitiyik or kaavyatmak he
 But it is different from the ornate and artistic prose style of Subandhu and Baan
 kathamoolak alankrita style ke chamatkaar kii paripakvata yadhyapi subandhu main praudh or baan main praudhatar he, tathaapi un donon main varnya vastu or paatro kaa charitrankan 'dashakumarcharit' kii apeksha dhoomil he
 The artistic idealist has made the style of 'vasavadatta' and 'kadambari' somewhat artificial by moving away from the reality
 par dandi kii gadhykavyastylee main us 'ati' or sayaastaa kaa prabhaav simaatikrami nahin he
 'daskumarcharit' is probably influenced by the story of Gunadhya with paischi language
 sambhavat: isi kaaran 'dashakumarcharit' par lokkathaon kii katharoodhiyon kaa bhi prabhaav padaa he
 The composition of adding the second, third etc
 series to the story is also targeted here
 isamen saatvin aathvin shatabdi ke samaaj kii durbalataaon or sabaltaaon, us kaal ke sankuchit or swarthparak raajnneetik sangharshon, naanaa varg ke vyaktiyon kii kamarthamulak kamajoriyon evam tadyugin samaaj kii andharudhiyon, andhvishwaason tathaa saidhantik or vyaavhaarik vaishamyon kaa atyant jeevant chithran miltaa he
 In the hierarchical characterization done through various categories and classes, a lively tableau of the society is seen
 kul milakar yugavishesh ke yatharth jivan kaa kavi ne paryaapt ankan kiya he
 Almost all scholars do not consider the five exorcisms of the antechamber of this book and the portion of the north pedestal to be punished
 unhen anya lekhakon dwaara likhit sweekaar karte hai
 The style of expression of the antechamber and antarithika is different from the eight eaves of the middle
 donon main manyatavishyak varnyamanyata bhi bhinn bhinn drushtiyon kaa sanket karti he
 It may have corrupted the opening and ending portions, but certainly the portion between the two pedigrees is devoid of undertaking and epilogue
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki is granthrachana kii yojana, jo dandi ke man main thi, pashachi kii 'brihatkatha' kii anugamini thi
 Even though the idea of collecting a large collection of folklore was there, it remained incomplete
 kuch log is granth ko nitivishyak yaa upadeshaarth rachit maanate hai
 But its composition is mainly poetic and has been made for aesthetic taste
 isamen kahin-kahin jo ashleelata dosha bataaya jaataa he vah thodaa bahut vaisaa hi he jaisaa 'kumarasambhav', naishadhacharit', 'shishupal vadh' yaa 'kiratarjunium' main
 The word number used by Dandi in 'dasakumarcharit' is more pronounced than the words used in 'kadambari' or 'vasavadatta'
 in tathaa anya kaarnon se sanskrit ke gadhykavyakaron main dandi kaa sthaan vishisht he
 Kavyadarsha is such a composition of Dandi which is of special importance from the idea of poetry
 drishykavy sambandhi 'naatyashaastra' ke ananthar keval 'bhamah' hi dandi se pracheenatar aise alankarik hai jinka granth adyavadhi uplabdh he
 But Dandi's 'poetry' is more mature, more comprehensive and more systematic than his work 'kavyalankar'
 usne parvarti anek alankarikon ke granthon or unki rachanastyli ko prabhavit kiya he
 'avantisundarikatha' is also an adult prose
 parantu uske krititv ke vivaadaaspad or granth ke apurna hone main yahan vishesh kuch na kahkar itnaa hi kahana paryaapat he ki vah ek praudh gadhykavy he
 It may also be that she had been a predecessor of 'dashkumarcharit'
 sab milakar dandi ko ham utkrisht kavyakaar or tadyugin shastrabodh kii drushti se ucch koti kaa alankarik kah sakate hai
