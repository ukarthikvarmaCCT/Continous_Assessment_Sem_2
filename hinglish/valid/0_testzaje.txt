 This heat, when coupled to a high thermo-coefficient optic, can give rise to thermal lensing and also with Can only reduce quantum efficiency
 Issues of this type from another innovative diode-pulsed solid-level laser diode-pulsed disc laser The thermal limits in this type of laser can be reduced through the use of geometry of a laser medium in which the thickness is smaller than the diameter
 This incorporates even more thermal blends into the material
 Thinner Disc lasers have been shown to produce up to the kilowatt level

 iske baad unhone vahaan 7 hafte alag alag jagahon par dhyaan karte hue bitaayaa or phir sarnath ja kar dharm kaa prachaar shuru kiya
 The followers of the Buddha later started visiting the place where Buddha had attained enlightenment on the full moon day in the month of Vaishakh
 dhire dhire ye jagah bodhgaya ke naam se janaa gaya or ye din buddha purnima ke naam se janaa gaya
 Around 528 BC In the month of Vaishakh, Gautama, the prince of Kapilavastu, abandoned the house in search of truth

 It is said that when this temple was being constructed, it was also decided to install a statue of Buddha in it

 Suddenly one day a person came and expressed his desire to make an idol
 lekin iske liye usne kuch shartten bhi rakhin
 It was his condition that he be given a stone pillar and a lamp
 uski ek or shartt yah bhi thi iske liye use chha: maheene kaa samay diya jaae tathaa samay se pehle koi mandir kaa darwaja na khole
 All the conditions were accepted, but the anxious villagers opened the temple door four days before the scheduled time
 mandir ke andar ek bahut hi sundar murtti thi jiskaa har ang aakarshak tha sivaay chaati ke
 The chest portion of the idol had not yet been completely cut
 kuch samay baad ek buddha bhikshu mandir ke andar rahane laga
 Once Buddha came in his dream and said that he had created the idol

 It is believed that he built the Mahabodhi Temple
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki pahli shatabdi main is mandir kaa nirmaan karaayaa gaya yaa uski marammat karai gai
 With the fall of Buddhism in India, this temple was forgotten by the people and this temple was buried in dust and mud

 Claims should not be categorized as methods of doing business
 Instead such claims should be treated like any other process claims’
 In view of the aforesaid change, an Appellate Court of America in the State Street case stated that whether a process is patentable or not should not be decided on whether the process does business but it should be seen that the process to be patented Whether it is being used in a useful way or not

 This reduces the diffusion coefficient of the oxide glass and the softening temperature
 yah vikachan ko roktaa he or iske prayog se kaach kaa dravan or shodh saral ho jaataa he
 Zinc oxide is often added to the slurry by zinc carbonate
 yah padaarth kaach ke prasar gunank ko bahut kam karata he
 It is used in the manufacture of chemical slabs because of its high stability in the slurry and less heat generated diffusion
 kuch kaachon main magnesium yaa barium oxide bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 Some substances are added to the kach for the purpose of producing special chemical properties
 sis yukt kaachon main kuch oxykaarak padaarth, jese potacium nitrate yaa shora kaa hona aavashyak hota he
 Many small bubbles of gas, which are called 'seeds', get trapped in the gas when it is liquefied
 kaach ko inase mukt karne ke liye kuch rasinic padaarthon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he

 in padaarthon ko 'shodhak dravya' kehete hai
 Generally, carbon ammonium salt or arsenic is used for purification
 aalu, chukundar or bhigi lakdi ke tukade dravit kaach main daalkar bhi kahin-kahin kaach kaa shodhan kiya jaataa he
 Kach is used in many types of commodities that require different physical properties
 kaach ke bhautik gunon main bhinnata vibhinn oxidon dwaara laai ja sakati he
 The physical properties also depend on the relative quantity of each oxide present in the pot
 ghanatv- kaach main sabase adhik ghanatv sis oxide dwaara aata he or sabase kam boric oxide dwaara
 Electrical properties- The electrochemicality of a kach is dependent on its composition, temperature and atmosphere
 aajkal kaach kaa upyog achaalak ke liye bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 Thermal properties - The heat is transmitted when heated, but there is minimal diffusion of boric oxide and magnesium oxide and maximum expansion from alkaline oxide
 ushma chaalakata- kaach ushma kaa adham chaalak he; silica tathaa boric oxide se kaach main ushma-chaalakata kam hoti he
 Other physical properties of the sachets, such as Young's coagulation coefficient, stress strength, firmness and thermal tolerance, depend on the oxides contained in the sachets

 He is giving stuttering speeches, thousands of spectators are getting upset by listening to this speech

 That's when he comes in contact with Lionel Log, an Australian language therapist in London

 He prepares Bertie to read Hamlet's "to be, or not to be" soliloquy, while listening to Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over headphones
 log berty ke dwaara padhe gaye vaakyon ko ek gramophone record par record kar letaa he, vah use bataata he ki berty puure pathan ke dauraan hakalaa rahaa tha, yah sunakar berty aavesh main aa jaataa he
 Then the log gives him the recording
 jab king jorge v 1934 kii christmas par sambodhan detaa he, tabhi vah apane putr ko aadhunik rajtantr ke prasaaran ke mahatva ke bare main bataata he
 Later, Bertie plays the log recording and listens to Shakespeare's text in his own voice
 vah log ke paas jaataa he, ve milakar mansapeshiyon ko relex karne or saans ke niyantran par kaam karte hai, jabaki saath hi log uske hakalane ke peeche manovaigyanik kaarnon kii jaanch bhi karata he
 The Prince describes some of the pressures of his childhood: such as his father having a strong mood towards him; Stress on his left hand due to his tendency to work; Painful metal treatment used to treat her knee in childhood; Also a nanny who always favored her older brother David, the Prince of Wales, deliberately harassed Bertie, making false complaints to her parents that would make her cry, but Bertie told her mother The father never took her side; And the early death of his younger brother Prince John in 1919 also became a cause of stress for him
 jaise jaise upachaar aage badhata gaya, ve donon mitra ban gaye, ek duusare ke vishwaasapaatr bhi ban gaye
 George v died on 20 January 1936 and David, Prince of Wales, was enthroned as King Edward VIII, but wanted to marry an American divorced sociologist, Velis Simpson, causing a constitutional crisis
 balamoral kaisal main ek party ke dauraan berty kahata he ki edward singhaasana par rahete hue ek talakshuda mahila se shaadi nahin kar saktaa, albert apane bhai par aarope lagaataa he ki vah use singhaasana se hataane ke liye madhyayugin style kii baaten kar rahaa he, us par vyangy kasata he ki vah apni bhashaa par dhyaan de
 Bertie is silent upon hearing these accusations and Edward teases her by calling her "BB Bertie" as a child
 agle satr main, prince is ghatana ko bhula nahin paaya he
 In an attempt to console him, the log states that Bertie can also become king and the Duke's crown can also be worn on his head
 use bhi yah sammaan hasil ho saktaa he
 Bertie accuses Logue of treason and angrily tells her that Logue could not succeed in his work
 jisase unki dosti main daraar aa jaati he
 When King Edward renounces his throne to marry, Bertie becomes King George VI
 is maukey par vah atyadhik abhibhoot hota he
 Also, he feels the need for logs
 vah or rani donon log ke ghar usase maafi maangane ke liye jate hai
 When the king states that Log will be seated in the king's box during his coronation at Westminster Abbey, Dr
 Cosmo Gordon Long, Archbishop of Canterbury, questions Log's educational qualifications
 iske kaaran ek baar phir se raja or log ke bich takaraav hota he, log spasht karata he usne pichley yuddh main ghayal hue sainikon kaa ilaaj karnaa shuru kar diya he
 As Log sits in the chair of St
 Edward and rejects a piece of cake thrown as a trifle, Log's clumsy contempt for logs by the King makes him realize that he is more than his previous kings
 Is talented
 sitambar 1939 main germany ke saath yuddh kii ghoshnaa ho jane par, jorge VI log ko buckingham peles bulaata he, taaki vah desh ke liye apana radio bhaashan taiyaar kar sake
 When King and Log go to the small studio through the palace, Winston Churchill tells King that he too stuttered, but somehow he recovers
 raja log ko apana bhaashan sunaata he, log use har pal koching detaa he
 Looking at the log, King arrives with his family in the balcony of the palace, where thousands have gathered to hear his speech
 ve is bhaashan kii saraahna karte hai
 a final title card states that the log was also present in most speeches by King George during World War II
 yah bhi spasht kiya jaataa he ki log or king mitra hai or "king jorge VI lyonal log ko 1944 main royal victorian order kaa commander bana detaa he
 Screenwriter David Seidler himself stuttered in childhood, believing that the cause was his mental trauma during World War II
 kyonki is pralay main uske dada daadi maare gaye the
 As a child, Seidler was inspired to learn that King George vi's problem of stammering was fixed
 "yahan ek raja tha jo haklaata tha or use radio bhaashan dene padate the, har koi uske shabdon ko sunata tha or isiilie usne itane junun ke saath apane aap ko thik karne kii koshish kii," seedler ne tippanee kii
 When Seidler became an author as an adult, he decided to write about King George VI
 sattar ke dashak ke ant main or assi ke dashak main usne king ke bare main jabardast chaanbin kii, lekin use log ke bare main paryaapt jaankaree nahin mili
 Eventually, Seidler contacted Doctor Valentine Logue who agreed to talk about his father
 usne rani maa kii ijaajat se unhen uplabdh pustikaayen deni chaahin
 The queen told him that he would never do this in his lifetime and Seidler stopped his project
 2002 main, rani maa kii mrityu ho gayi
 Three years later, Seidler succumbed to cancer, returning to his creative work for which his illness had inspired him
 unke anusandhan ke dauraan unki mulaaqaat ek ankal se hua, jinka ilaaj log ne kiya tha, unase usne yah janaa ki log is sthiti ke kaarnon ke jaanch ke saath shwasan vyaayaam pranali kaa bhi upyog karte the
 With this type of preparation Seidler envisioned his session
 unhone puri patakatha ko apni patni ko dikhaaya
 His wife liked it, but said it sounded "very different from the technique of cinema", suggesting that they rewrite it as a stage play, so that the relationship between King and George was essential
 To be focused
 jab unhone ise puraa kar liya, unhone kuch logon ko ise bheja or iske bare main un logon kii pratikraya praapt kii
 In early 2006, one of the people Seidler sent his play sent it to Joan Lane of the Wild theme
 wild theme landan main ek production company he
 Lane felt it was also a play with a potential screen drama and he showed it to Simon Egan of Bedlem Productions, who recorded the first textual exercises
 len or bedlem ne milakar plisance theatre main iske pathan kii vyavastha kii, yah australian pravaasiyon ke samooh ke liye uttari bharat main ek chota sa house he
 That's when Tom Hooper's mother immediately called her son and said, "i've found the next project for you
" " manch par iskaa drishy dekhne ke baad, wild theme ne is patakatha ko jeophri rash ko bheja, tabhi chotii ke film nirdeshak tom hupar ne bhavi patakatha kii taiyaari kar lee; or bedlem production ne si-sa film main lain canning ko yah patakatha bhej di, jise laga ki isamen feechar film banaaye jane kii kshamta he
 Hooper loved the story, but thought the original ending needed to be changed, "if you listen to the actual speech, he's clearly struggling with his stuttering problem
" lekin yah ek purna pradarshan nahin he
 He is doing so in some way
 " In June 2009, the UK film Council gave the production a £ 1 million award

 Also, it was necessary to present the film in real terms, presenting a combination of London's Depression-era, imperial affluence
 25 navambar 2009 ko derek jecobi ne southwark main pullen building main filmakan kii prakriya main hissaa liya
 On 26 November, filming was done for a week at Forth, Rush and Jacoby at Ely Cathedral, the location used for Wesminster Abbey
 haalanki linkan cathedral ebbe se kaaphi miltaa julata he, phir bhi dal ne eli ko ek pasandida lokation ke rup main praathamikta di
 Its size was sufficient to create sets in which not only the coronation scenes could be filmed but preparations could also be made before that

 The Draper's Hall was used for the Accession Council where common decorations were made for the new King's scenes and paintings of the predecessors; Incidentally, Albert had become a freeman of the Drapers Company by this stage
 dal ne log ke purv paraamarsh vaale kamare kii jaanch kii, lekin ve filmakan ke liye bahut chote the
 Instead, they searched for a high vaulted room at 33 Portland Place, not far away
 production diziner, eve stevart, ko maujuuda wal paper itane pasand aaye ki unhone puure kamare main isi prabhaav ko punah nirmit kiya
 In the opening scene, the scene was set for the closing ceremony of the British Empire exhibition at the 1925 Wembley Stadium in the location of Island Road, Home of Leeds United and Oddsley Stadium, Home of Bradford Bulls
 iland road kaa upyog vahaan kiya gaya jahaan hakalane vaala prince apana saarvajanik bhaashan dene ke liye chal kar jaataa he or odsal stadium ko isliye chunaa gaya tha kyonki yah 1925 ke wemble stadium se miltaa julata tha
 The team could use the stadium only at 10 pm after a football game, at which time the dummies were dressed in periodic costumes and filled on the terraces

 The final cut of the film was completed on 31 August 2010
 hupar ne rajasi paridrishy utpann karne ke liye kai cinemai takneekon kaa upyog kiya
 The New York Times chief film critic, Manohala Durges, wrote that an attempt has been made to show King's head using a fish eye lens, although Hooper denied it, stating that he would normally have done something out of the ordinary for film photography Wide lenses are used
 roger abert ne kaha ki film ke adhikansh bhaag ko andar filmaaya gaya he, jahaan ytaakar set, koridor or chote sthaan sankare galiyaaron ko darshaate hai, jisase aitihaasik drama ke anusaar saamaanya rajasi prabhaav prakat nahin hota he
 Hooper has taken wide shots for acting actors, notably Geoffrey Rush who trained Jacques Lecoq in Paris at the l'ecole International Day Theater and "consequently looks quite impressive the way they deliver"
 hupar rash ke haavbhaav ko shoot karne ke liye pehle apane scope ko chaudaa karte hai, uske baad puure sharir kii gatividhiyon kaa shot liya jaataa he
 The same approach has also been used for Forth
 paraamarsh ke pehle drishy main, duk ko ek badi diwaar ke peeche ek lambe sofe ke ant main baitha hua dikhaaya gaya he, "jaise sofe kii bhujaa kaa upyog ek suraksha kambal ke rup main, ek tarah ke mitra ke rup main kiya ja rahaa ho?" martin philler ne deni kohen kii "kam vettege" kii cinemetography kii prashansa kii he, unke anusaar isamen sab kuch bahut "prabal" dikhataa he
 The film's score is composed by Alexander Desplat
 ek film jisamen ek vyakti apane aap main sudhaar karne ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he, desplate ne naatak kala kaa pradarshan karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 She has reflected the challenge: "this is a film about the voice
 sangeet bhi usee ke anusaar hona chahie
 Let the music show the silence
 sangeet samay ke anusaar ho
"score main string or piano kaa upyog kiya gaya he, is prakaar ke sangeet kaa uddeshy he raja kii chuppi ke peeche chhipi udaasi ko darshana or uske or log ke bich mitrataa ko badhanaa
 This approach emphasizes the protagonist's struggle for control in the story
 desplate ne raja kii bhashaa kii samasya ko darshane ke liye ek hi note kaa baar baar upyog kiya he
 As the film progresses, the deepening music begins to reflect the close friendship between the two individuals, reaching the climax of the coronation scene
 mul rup se hupar is film ko sangeet ke bina bananaa chaahate the, haalanki desplate ne tark diya ki yahi kahani kaa vaastavik charmotkarsh hoga, yah vah bindu hoga jab un donon kii mitrataa is seemaa tak pahunch jaayegi ki ve ek duusare par bharosa karne lagenge
 "it's really rare" Des Plate said, "mostly we only have love stories
 "ek aavadhik dhwani kii rachana ke liye score ko microphone par record kiya gaya, jise vishesh rup se shahi parivaar ke liye banaaya gaya tha, ise EMI sangrahon se nishkarshith kiya gaya tha
 The score was nominated for several awards, including a nomination for "best Original Score" on Golden Globes, BAFTA and Oskar
 film ke clymex par 1939 ke radio bhaashan ke prasaaran ke dauraan bajaayaa gaya sangeet bithovan kii saatvin simphoni ke duusare movement se liya gaya he
 According to screenwriter David Seidler, director Tom Hooper tried as far as possible to maintain historical accuracy, the two worked together for four months to make the best screenplay possible and to be certified
 lyonal log ke pote ke saath ek bibisi saakshaatkaar ke anusaar, film kii team ko shooting se lagbhag nau maheene pehle log ke mul nots kii diary mil gayi thi, jisamen duk ke upachaar ke bare main likhaa gaya tha
 That's when he worked on the script once again according to the notes
 hupar ne kaha ki film kii kai yaadgaar line log ke nots se liye gaye pratyaksh uddhran hai
 However, certain changes have been made for dramatic and artistic reasons
 professor kathi shultz ne bataaya ki film nirmaataaon ne ghatnaon ke kalkram ko kuch varshon main samet liya he
 In fact, the Duke of York began working with Lionel Log in October 1926, ten years before the crisis of renunciation
 jaisaa ki film main darshaya gaya he bhashaa main sudhaar kai varshon ke bajaay kai maheenon main hua prathit hota he: jon gordan ke saath 1952 main akhbaar ke ek saakshaatkaar main, log ne kaha ki "hakalane kii samasya thik hone baad unhone 1927 main cannebra main australian sansad khol lee"; arthath duk ke log ke saath kaam shuru karne ke kuch maheene baad hi yah hua
 a royal advisor, Hugo Vickers, agreed that sometimes historical changes would have to be made to make some changes to preserve the essence of the play's story
 For example, high-ranking officials would not be present at the time the King spoke, Nor would Churchill have been involved in this at any stage, "but an average viewer knows who Churchill is; he does not know that Lord Halifax and Lord Hoare are Who is
 " Lionel's grandson, Robert Log, expressed doubts about the description of the language therapist in the film, stating, "I don't think he ever swore in front of the King and he certainly never called him 'bertie'" 
 itihaaskaar andrew roberts ne kaha ki raja ke hakalane kii gambhirtha ko atiranjit karke darshaya gaya he, edward VIII, velis simpasan or jorge v ke paatro ko vaastaviktaa se adhik virdohi darshaya gaya he, taaki naatakeey prabhaav ko badhaaya ja sake
 Christopher Hitchens and Isaac Chotinar challenged the film's portrayal of Winston Churchill's role in the crisis of renunciation
 yah janaa man tathy he ki churchill ne pad tyaag ke prati virodh prakat karne ke liye edward VIII ko protsaahit kiya tha, jabaki unhen film main prince albert ke samarthak ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he or pad tyaag ke khilaaf nahin darshaya gaya he
 Hitchens attributed this treatment to the "methodology" surrounding Churchill's legacy
 ek smart, acchhee tarah se bani film main, "kya ek sachhee kahani aanshik rup se darshakon ke liye adhik dilachasp nahin hoti?" vah aashcharyachakit he
 He also criticized the film for its failure to create appeasements of the era
 jabaki film main pratyaksh rup se mudde kaa ullekh nahin kiya gaya or chotinner kaa tark he ki jorge VI tushtikaran ke khilaaf tha, vishesh rup se antim drishy main jahaan "churchill or king buckingham peles main hai or ekta par bhaashan diya ja rahaa he or pratirodh kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 Keeping himself away from the Chamberlain appeasement policy, King George VI sent a car to meet Chamberlain when he returned in September 1938 by signing a Munich Agreement with Hitler
 tabhi king or chemberlen buckingham pales kii balkoni main khadey ho gaye, log unki jaijyakaar kar rahe the
 That is why historian Steven Rünseman wrote that King George VI, acting on Chamberlain's foreign policy, promoted "the greatest constitutional crisis which is the biggest mistake made by any king in this century
" " gargian ne stenle baldwin ke chithran main sudhaar kiya, iske liye unhone britain ke aayudh aadesh kii asweekruti ke liye istipha de diya, jab ve vastav main "rashtriya hero ke rup main saamne aaye, ek dashak se zyada choti par rahe
 " martin philler is baat se sahamat the ki choti swatantraaaen vastav main kalatmak license ko uchit tehraati hai, sambhavatya us kalpit drishy main jisamen jorge v apane putr ko prasaaran ke mahatv ke bare main bhaashan detaa he, ise ek sahi bindu bataata he
 George VI never tolerated that Logue would address him in an informal manner, nor did he swear, he probably understood German, and was actually a bit hot about Churchill, as his brother later relinquished the crisis
 Was supported in film ke antim drishy par tippanee dete hue, jab king buckingham peles kii balkoni main khadaa he, 3 sitambar 1939 ko yuddh kii ghoshnaa par bhaashan de rahaa he, andrew roberts likhaa he, "yah drishy aitihaasik drushtikon se betuka he- neville chemberlen or winston churchill maujuud nahin the or buckingham peles ke baahar jaijyakaar karne vaali koi bheed bhi nahin thi
 Overall, Roberts praises the film for its portrayal of King as a "quiet, submissive hero" and he says: "the portrayals by Firth and Bonheim Carter are sympathetic and intense and give the film's original factual vindictiveness Should not be different
 " The film premiered on September 4, 2010 at the Telluride Film Festival in the United States
 isaki screening farth ke 50 wein janm din par 2010 ke toronto film samaaroh main kii gayi, jahaan ise standing ovations mili or isane piples chois kaa puraskaar jeeta
 The redesigned theater release poster featured a close-up of Forth and a microphone, before Hopper criticized the earlier design as a "train smash"
 film ko prarambh main sanyukt rajya main release ke liye british film vargeekaran board ke dwaara 15 kii reating di gayi, kyonki isamen kuch drishy aise the jisamen log raja ko tanaav karne ke liye chillane ke liye protsaahit karata he
 At the London Film Festival, Hooper criticized the decision, raising questions about how a rating of "15" attests to the film's bad language, despite its graphic torture scenes of Salt and Casino Royale being rated 12 A
 
 hupar kii aalochana ke baad, board ne isaki reating ko kam karke "12A" kar diya, saath hi anumati di gayi ki 12 varsh se kam umr ke bachche ek vyask ke saath baithkar is film ko dekh sakate hai
 Hooper drew similar criticism at the Motion Picture Association of America, rating the film an R, and stating that children under 17 would not be able to watch the film with an adult
 is reating ke liye koi apil nahin kii gayi thi
 In this review, Roger Ebert criticized the r rating, stating that it could not be "made very clear" and that "it is an excellent film for teens"
 janvari 2011 main, produser harvey vinstin ne kaha ke ve kuch apshabdon ko hataane ke liye film ke punarasampadan ke bare main soch rahe the, taaki ise kam vargeekaran mili or zyada darshak ise dekh saken
 Tom Hooper, however, refused to cut the film, though he covered the swear words with a beep

 Syrian Province sicyor shail ek asurakshit network par surakshit rup se oparating network sevaaon ke liye ek kryptographic network protocol he
 The best known example is for remote login on computer systems by application users
 esaech ek esaech sarwar ke saath esaech client aplication ko jodne, client-sarwar architekchar main ek asurakshit network par ek surakshit channel pradaan karata he
 Common applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH
 protocol vinirdesh do pramukh sanskarnon ke bich antar karata he, jise esaech -1 or esaech -2 kaha jaataa he
 The most visible application of the protocol is for accessing shell accounts on Unix-like operating systems, but it also sees some limited usage on Windows
 2015 main, microsoft ne ghoshnaa kii ki bhavishya main relies main esaech ke liye mul samarthan shaamil hoga
 SSH was designed to replace Telnet and for unprotected remote shell protocols such as Berkeley Ragin, RSP, and rexac protocols
 ve protocol sade text main jaankaree, vishesh rup se password bhejte hai, jo packet vishleshan kaa upyog karke avrodh or prakatikaran ke liye atisamvedansheel hote hai
 The encryption used by SSH is intended to provide the confidentiality and integrity of data over unsecured networks such as the Internet, although leaked files by Edward Snowden indicate that the National Security Agency can sometimes decrypt SSH, allowing them to Allows read content of SSH sessions
 
 On 6 July 2017, government transparency organization wikileaks confirmed that the US Central Intelligence Agency had developed tools that could be installed on computers running Microsoft Windows or GNU / Linux operating systems to start on systems compromised by SSH customers SSH connection made can be stopped! paribhaasha SSH uses public key cryptography to authenticate remote computers and, if necessary, allow the user to authenticate
 esaech kaa upyog karne ke kai tareeke hai; ek network conection ko ancript karne ke liye swachaalit rup se jenerate kiye gaye saarvajanik-nijee kunjee jode kaa upyog karnaa he, or phir log on karne ke liye password pramanikaran kaa upyog karnaa he
 Another is to use a manually generated public-private key pair to perform authentication, allowing users or programs to log in without specifying a password
 is paridrishy main, koi bhi vibhinn kunjee kii milan karne vaali jodi utpann kar saktaa he
 The public key is placed on all computers that must allow access to the owner of the matching private key
 jabaki pramanikaran nijee kunjee par aadhaarit he, pramanikaran ke dauraan kunjee ko network ke madhyam se kabhi bhi sthanantarit nahin kiya jaataa he
 SSH only verifies if the same person offering the public access is the owner of the matching private key
 esaech ke sabhi sanskarnon main agyaat saarvajanik kunjee ko satyapit karnaa mahatvapurn he, yani unhen maanya ke rup main sweekaar karne se pehle, saarvajanik kunjee ko pahchaan ke saath sambhddha karen
 Accepting an attacker's public key without verification would authorize an unauthorized attacker as a legitimate user
 mukhya prabandhan On systems such as Unix, the list of authorized public keys is typically stored in the home directory of the user who is allowed to remotely log into the file ~ / 
ssh / authorized_ keys
 yah fil keval esaech dwaara sammanit he yadi yah maalik or root ke alaava kisi bhi cheez se likhane yogya nahin he
 When the public key is present at the remote end and the matching private key is present at the local end, the password does not require typing in the stack
 This password needs to be well)
 haalanki, atirikt suraksha ke liye nijee kunjee ko pasfrez se lock kiya ja saktaa he
 The private key can also be viewed in standard locations, and its full path can be specified as a command line setting
 esaech-kijen upyogita hameshaa jodon main saarvajanik or nijee kunjee banaati he
 SSH also supports password-based authentication that is encrypted with an automatically generated key
 is maamle main, hamalavar vaid sarwar paksh kii nakal kar saktaa he, password maang saktaa he, or ise praapt kar saktaa he 
 However, this is only possible if the two parties have never authenticated before, as SSH remembers the key that previously used the server
 esaech client ek nae, pehle agyaat sarwar kii kunjee sweekaar karne se pehle ek chetavanee uthaata he
 Password authentication can be disabled prayog SSH is commonly used to log into a remote machine and execute commands, but it supports tunneling, forwarding TCP ports and X11 connections; It can transfer files using the corresponding SSH file transfer or secure copy protocol
 SSH client-sarwar model kaa upyog karata he Standard TCP port 22 is assigned to contact the SSH server
 ek esaech client program aamtaur par remote conection sweekaar karne vaale esaech dimen se conection sthapit karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Both typically exist on most modern operating systems, including macos, most distributions of Linux, openbsd, freebsd, netbsd, Solaris, and openvms
 vishesh rup se, windos kuch aadhunik desktop / sarwar oes main se ek he jisamen difolt rup se esaech shaamil nahin he
 Versions of ownership, freeware and open source varying levels of complexity and completeness exist

 William Shakespeare - 23 April 1616) was an English poet, poetical scholar, playwright and actor
 unke naatakon kaa lagbhag sabhi pramukh bhashaaon main anuwaad hua he
 Shakespeare had a very high prolific talent as well as an intuitive knowledge of the rules of art
 prakruti se unhen maano vardaan mila tha at: unhone jo kuch chhu diya vah sona ho gaya
 His creations are not only an object of pride for the British caste, but are also immortal Vibhuti of the world universe
 shakespeare kii kalpana jitani prakhar thi utana hi gambhir unke jivan kaa anubhav bhi tha
 Therefore, on the one hand, his plays and his poems bring joy to the achievement, on the other hand we get serious biography from his works
 vishwasahitya ke itihaas main shakespeare ke samakaksh rakhe janevaale virale hi kavi milte hai
 William Shakespeare was the eldest son and third child of John Shakespeare and Mary Arden
 inkaa janm stretford aan evan main hua
 During his childhood, he was educated at the local Free Grammar School
 pita kii badhati hui aarthik kathinaaiyon ke kaaran unhen paathshaala chhodkar chote mote dhandhon main lag janaa padaa
 He decided to go to London for a living
 is nishchay kaa ek doosraa kaaran bhi tha
 Perhaps he had to leave his birthplace in fear of legal proceedings towards the theft of deer from the garden of Sir Thomas Loose, the landlord of Charl Kot
 unka vivaah san 1582 main en hathave se ho chukaa tha
 Around 1585, Shakespeare came to London
 shuru main unhone ek rangashaala main kisi choti naukari par kaam kiya, kintu kuch dinon ke baad ve lard chemberlen kii company ke sadsy ban gaye or landan kii pramukh rangashaalaon main samay samay par abhinay main bhaag lene lage
 After eleven years, he returned to Stratford upon Avon in 1596 and now he strengthened his family's financial system
 san 1597 main inhone dhire dhire navnirmaan evam vistaar kiya
 After 1610, he started spending more and more time in this building and he died there in 1616
 shakespeare kii rachanaaon ke tithikram ke sambandh main kaaphi matbhed he
 In 1930, the famous scholar Sir E
K
 The table that Chambers presented on Tithikrama is generally accepted today
 tab bhi idhar pichley varshon kii khoj se tithiyon ke sambandh main kuch naveen dharanaayen bani hai
 On the basis of these new discoveries, Mac Manway sir has prepared a new table which Sir E
K
 The list of Chambers is somewhat different
 lagbhag 20 varshon ke saahitiyik jivan main shakespeare kii sarjanaatmak pratibha nirantar viksit hoti gai
 In general, four different stages are seen in this development
 praarambhik avasthaa 1595 main samaapt hui
 Almost all the works of this period are experimental
 shakespeare abhi tak apana maarg nishchit nahin kar paae the, atev vibhinn prachlit rachanapranaliyon ko kram se karyanvit karke apana rachanavidhan susthir kar rahe the, pracheen sukhaant naatakon kii prahasanatmak style main unhone 'di kamedi ov erars' or 'di teming of di su' kii rachana kii
 Subsequently, in 'love's Labors Lost', he followed the pattern of Lily's courtly pleasures
 isamen rajdurbar kaa vaataavaran upasthit kiya gaya he jo chatur paatro ke rochak vaartalap se paripurna he
 'the Two Gentlemen of Verona' imitates Greene's romanticistic pleasantries
 du:khant naatak bhi anukaranaatmak hai
 In 'richard III' the goods are imitated and in 'titus Andronicus' the Kid is followed but in 'romeo and Juliet' the element of origin is relatively high
 isi kaal main likhi hui donon prasiddh kavitaayen 'di rape aav lukris' or 'venus and adonis' par tatkaaleen italian premakavy kii chhap he
 The second phase of development ended in 1600
 isamen shakespeare ne anek praudh rachanaayen sansar ko bhent kin
 Now he had set his path and gained confidence
 'e mid samar nits dream' tathaa 'di marchent aav venice' rochak evam lokapriy sukhaant naatak hai kintu inase bhi adhik mahatv rakhanevaale shakeyapear ke sarvotkrisht sukhaant naatak 'much ado ebout nathing', 'aij you like it' tathaa 'twailvath nite' isi kaal main likhe gaye
 In these plays, the imagination of the poet and the pleasure of his mind are well published
 sarvottam aitihaasik naatak bhi isi samay likhe gaye
 Marlowe-influenced 'richard II' is far more successful in composition than the previous category of the same category, 'richard III'
 'henry chaturth' ke donon bhaag or 'henry pancham' jo suvikhyath aitihaasik naatak hai, isi kaal kii rachanaayen hai
 Almost all of Shakespeare's sonnets, which are unique for their excellent expression, were written between 1595 and 1607
 teesri avasthaa, jiskaa ant lagbhag 1607 main hua, shakespeare ke jivan main vishesh mahatv rakhti he
 The poet's mind was distressed over the years due to family misfortune and health problems
 at: in dinon kii adhikansh rachanaayen du:khant hai
 The worldly sorrow drama Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, and the Roman sorrow drama Julius Caesar, 'antoine and Cleopatra' and 'coriolanus' were written and played during this period
 'travaylas and cracida', 'als wel dait ands wel' or 'major for major' main sukh or du:kha kii sanshlisht abhivyakti hui he, tab bhi du:khad ansh kaa hi praadhanya he
 In the final stages of development, Shakespeare created Perrickles, Sinvelin, 'the Winters Tale', 'the Tempest' Prabhriti plays, which, despite being peaceful, filled with sad possibilities and created an evening atmosphere
 in sukhaant du:khant naatakon ko romance athwa shakespeare ke antim naatakon kii sangya di jaati he
 Shakespeare's pleasant plays have their own personal characteristics
 yadhyapi 'di kamedi aav erars' main platus kaa anusaran kiya gaya he tathaapi anya sukhaant naatak pracheen clasiki naatakon se sarvatha bhinn hai
 Their purpose is not to eradicate the deformities and improve the errors by the skit, but to entertain people through interesting story and characterization
 is prakaar ke praaia: sabhi naatakon kaa vishay prem kii aisi teevr anubhuti he jo yuvakon or yuvatiyon ke man main sahaj aakarshan ke rup main swat: utpann hoti he
 Obstacles first come in the way of the lovers but by the end of the play the difficulties are overcome and they result
 in rachanaaon main jivan kii kavitvapurn evam kalpanapravan abhivyakti hui he or samast vaataavaran ahlad se ot-prot he
 Shakespeare was introduced to certain upper-class families and the kind of life he saw in them is published in these plays
 du:khant naatakon main maanav jivan kii gambhir samasyaon par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 The aristocratic protagonists of these plays become victims of torture and destruction after being on the road to success and progress for some time
 unke du:kha or mrityu ke kya kaaran hai, is vishay par shakespeare kaa mat spasht rup se abhivyakt hua he
 The misfortune of the protagonist is partly derived from unfavorable destiny and circumstances, but a much bigger reason is found in his character weakness
 pracheen unani dukhaant naatakon main nayak keval trutipurna nirnay athwa trutipurna drushtikon ke kaaran vinasht hota tha parantu, kadachit isai dharm or naitikwaad se prabhavit hokar, shakespeare ne apane naatakon main nayak ke patan kii pradhan jimmedaari uski charitrik durbalata par hi rakhi he
 Hamlet, Athelo, Lear and Macbeth - all of them find such a deficiency in their nature or character that causes their suffering and death
 in du:khant naatakon main duhara dwandv parilakshith hua he, aantarik dwandv ev bahya dwandv
 Internal conflict arises in the mind of the hero, in his thoughts and feelings and due to his intensity not only makes decisions difficult but also distracts the hero's principle for some time
 is prakaar ke aantarik dwandv ke kaaran naatakon main manovaigyanik sookshmata or rochakata kaa aavirbhaav hua he
 External conflict arises from the competition of external powers and their struggle, such as mutual opposition of two opposing political parties or armies
 shakespeare ke pramukh du:khant naatakon main raktagat evam bhayaavah drishyon kii avatarana ke kaaran atyant aatankapurna vaataavaran nirmit hua he
 Likewise, the incorporation of murder and vengeance scenes also deepened the process of depression
 in sabhi visheshtaon or upkarnon ko shakespeare ne katipay puraane naatakon tathaa seneka, kid, marlo aadi naatakakaron se grahan kiya tha or samayik lokaruchi ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi unka upyog apane naatakon main kiya tha
 The features of the grief dramas we have mentioned here are found not only in Hamlet, Athelo, King Lear, and Macbeth, but also partly in the grief plays based on Romeo and Juliet and the history of England and Rome
 Huh
 shakespeare ne jin aitihaasik naatakon kii rachana kii unamem kai roman itihaas vishyak hai
 In the writings of these Roman plays, Shakespeare has altered the facts of history quite a bit, and at some sites it appears that the portrait of life presented is not of ancient Rome but of Elizaveth England
 itnaa hone par bhi ye naatak sadaiv lokapriy rahe hai, visheshkar julius sijar tathaa antony and cleopatra
 Antoine Aid Cleopatra is full of poetic passages and the characterization of Cleopatra is extremely effective
 timen ov athens or pericules main unani itihaas kii ghatnaon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Among the plays based on English history, there are some that are written only partially by Shakespeare, but both Henry IV and Henry v are penned by Shakespeare
 in teenon naatakon main kavi ko mahan safalataa mili he
 They have a very attractive rendition of valor and honor and Falstaff's character is very interesting and charming
 richard tritiy or richard dwitiya main marlo kaa anukaran safaltaapurvak kiya gaya he
 Most English historical plays prior to Shakespeare contained inanimate depictions of facts and events, and they were monotonous due to blank history
 shakespeare ne is prakaar ke naatakon ko jeevant rup dekar chamatkaarpurn bana diya he
 Shakespeare's mature biography is found in the final plays
 mahakavi ko apane jivan main vibhinn prakaar ke anubhav hue the jinaki jhalak uni kritiyon main dikhaai padati he
 There is imagination in the pleasing plays of love, and the poet's mind is rich in luxury and youth
 du:khant naatakon main aise du:khad anubhavon ko abhivyakti he jo jivan ko vishakt bana dete hai
 Shakespeare's work has resulted in the creation of plays that have resulted in his perfect intelligence
 kavi ab apni vivekpurna drushti se dekhtaa he ki jivan main sukh or du:kha donon sannivisht rahete hai, at: daanon hi kshanik hai
 Both are embedded in grief in life, so both are transient
 jivan main du:kha ke baad sukh aata he, atev vichaar or vyavhaar main samatv vaanchhneeya he
 These final plays lead to the conclusion that mercy and forgiveness are more invulnerable than violence and vengeance
 apane gambhir naitik sandesh ke kaaran in naatakon kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Shakespeare's plays are Romantic and separate from the tradition of ancient Greek and Latin plays
 at: unamem vastuvinyas kii shastreey visheshtaon ko foondnaa uchit nahin he
 Only in his last play 'the Tempest' have he managed the three inventions
 praaia: sabhi anya naatakon main keval karyanviti kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he, samay or sthaan kii drushti se ve nitant niabandh hai
 There is always enough detail in the plot and usually many stories are embedded in it
 udaahranarth ham e mid samar nits dream, di marchent aav venice, aiz you like it athwa king lier ko le sakate hai
 In all these, a mix of many stories has done the objective work
 kintu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki shakespeare ke naatakon kii banaavat trutipurna he
 The end-of-the-story storytelling is beautifully crafted, and there is a sense of unity collected from the entire plot
 shastreey arth main anvitiyon kaa abhaav hone par bhi in svachhndathawadi naatakon main bhavanatmak tathaa kalpanaatmak ekikaran hua he
 Shakespeare has more success in characterization
 apane naatakon main unhone anek aakarshak paatro kii sristi kii he jo apane jeevant rup main hamaare saamne aate hai
 Over time the process of characterization became more and more subtle and artistic
 udhaaharan ke liye ham sukhaant naatakon main samavisht rojalin, porcia, viartras, rojalind, vyla prabhruti pragalbha naariyon ko le sakate hai jo apni prakhar buddhi or vaakchaturi kaa parichay nirantar detii hai
 The second category are those women whose unique beauty and perilous experiences lead to compassion in the mind
 es naariyon main pramukh hai juliet, ophilia, desdymona, cardilia, imozen ityadi
 Characterization is highly important in sad plays
 udhaaharan ke liye ham hamelet ko le sakate hai
 All the events of the play are centered on the character of the protagonist and the development of the narrative is effected by his personality
 anshat: yahi baat anya du:khant naatakon ke liye bhi satya he
 Many memorable characters are found in ancient Greek plays, but Shakespeare's main characters, depicted using moral and psychological devices, are far more interesting and attractive
 aantarik dwandv ke upyog se du:khant naatakon kii patrakalpana or bhi adhik chamatkaarpurn ho gai he
 Some other characters in Shakespeare's plays are also notable such as clown and villain
 vidushakon main phalstaff tochastone, feste or king lier kaa swamibhakt vidooshak aadi mahatvapurn hai
 Villains include Richard III, Iago, Edmund Iyashi, etc
 jaisaa hazlit ne likhaa he, shakespeare kii shakti kaa pataa isse lagata he ki na keval unke mahatvapurn paatro main vaishishty he varan unke bahusankhyak laghu paatr bhi apana nijee mahatv rakhte hai
 Although prose is used elsewhere in Shakespeare's plays, they are still poetic in origin
 unka adhikansh bhaag chandobaddh he
 Not only this, almost all theatrical works are full of poetic qualities
 kalpana kaa prakaashan, alankarik abhivyakti, sangitatmak lay tathaa komal bhaawanaaon ke nirupan dwaara shakespeare ne manomuguakari prabhaav utpann kar diya he
 Since ancient times, plays were considered a mere distinction of poetry and Shakespeare accepted the ancient notion
 gadhy kaa prayog yada kada vishesh prayojan se hua he
 But in general we can call Shakespeare's plays poetic
 kavyatatv shuru main atyadhik tha kintu shanai: shanai: uskaa rup sanyat ho gaya or prayojan ke vichaar se uskaa niyantran hone laga
 Likewise, there was a constant effort to incorporate Shakespeare's style; As a result, early plays have an abundance of elaborate narratives and beautiful metaphors
 His style was balanced in his mature age by the time Shakespeare was composing his famous sorrowful plays
 praathmik avasthaa main abhivyakti kaa adhik mahatv tha or vichaaron kaa kam
 But in this secondary period, there is proper coordination of ideas, expressions and means of expression
 yah santulit vyavastha antim varshon main shakespeare kaa dhyaan vichaaron or naitik pratimaanon par kendrit tha or unhone shailigat chamatkaar kii upeksha kii
 That is why the style of the final plays has gone somewhere rough
 shakespeare ne apane naatak mukhyat: rangamanch par abhinay ke liye likhe the, yadhyapi kaavyatmak gunon ke kaaran ham unase pathan dwaara bhi anand praapt karte hai
 The arrangement of the acting of the erstwhile theater, the public interest of the audience, all influenced Shakespeare's theatrical production
 do ek udhaaharan hi paryaapt honge
 At that time dyed curtains were not used, so many descriptive pieces have been included in plays
 inhen varnanon dwaara sthaan, kaal or paristhiti kaa sanket hota tha
 The continuous use of the subject and self-talk in plays was possible because the next triangular part of the theater continued to spread among the observers
 kai purush or nari paatro kaa sarjan shakespeare ne keval isliye kiya ki unke upyukt abhinayta uplabdh the
 Many scenes have been opened for the entertainment of the audience, in which exciting and entertaining situations have been performed at the theater
 aaj ke yathartwaadee rangamanch kii bhanti elizveth yugin rangamanch prachur sadhano tathaa nishchit vyavastha dwaara bandhaa hua tha
 Both the acting and the performances were relatively free, so Shakespeare's plays have enough merit
 praaia: sabhi prakaar ke naatakon main mahakavi ne gey muktakon kaa sannivesh kiya he jo apane saundarya or maadhurya ke liye anupam hai
 Apart from these, there are elaborate poems of Shakespeare, in which 'vince and Adonis', 'the Rape of Lucreis' and Sanates are required to be mentioned
 ye sabhi kritiyaan 16 veen shatabdi ke antim dashak kii hai jab shakespeare kaa man saundarya evam pranay ke prabhaav se ahladaparn ho gaya tha
 An ancient love story has been described in a very poetic manner in 'vince and Adonis'
 'di rape ov lukris' main ek param sundari roman mahila ke durbhaagya or mrityu kii katha he
 There are some in the Sannets who are related to a friend of the poet who had decided not to marry
 shakespeare ne uske rup or gunon kii charchaa karte hue usase apana nishchay badalane ke liye aagrah kiya he
 The second order of the sennets is related to a Shyamvarna woman, who had developed intense attraction in the mind of the poet, but who did not respect the affection and gave her love to the friend of the poet, keeping in mind the first order of the sennets
 shakespeare ne in saneton main apni aantarik bhaawanaaon kaa prakaashan kiya he athwa ve paramparaagat rachanaayen maatr hai, yah prashn atyant vivadagrast he

 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'

 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers

 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer

 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization

 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world

 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction

 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep

 There are change rooms next to the clothes

 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose

 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storehouse
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
