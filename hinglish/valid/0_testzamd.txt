 After 10-15 days, they are planted in other large pots at a distance of two to four inches
 kuch samay or bitne par inhen kheton main aropit kar dete hai
 Waste seeds, planting plants too close, inadvertent planting, planting them in the fields before autumn or delaying planting in the fields, inappropriate land, or lack of water, all of these cause a loss in the karmakalas
 Often they are not able to make a good sap and they start giving flowers and seeds soon

 The tendency of rotting of the stem in Karamkale is caused by an infectious disease, which spreads in the dung etc
 of the invasive seeds and diseased Karamkala-eating four-footers
 rogagrast paudhon ko jala daalana chahie or agali baar beej bote samay gamale kii mitti ko formaldihide ke fike vilyan se kuch samay tak tar rakhana chahie
 The seeds should also be soaked in this solution for 15 minutes

 But with a slight difference we can see a clear glimpse of uniformity in them
 brajabhasha kii apni rupagat prakruti aukarant he arthath isaki ekvachaneey puling sangyaayen tathaa visheshan praaia: aukarant hote hai; jaise khurpu, yamrau, maanjhu aadi sangya shabd aukarant hai
 Similarly, the adjective terms karau, gorau, savanrau etc
 are immediate
 kriya kaa saamaanya bhootkaalik ekvachan puling rup bhi brajabhasha main pramukhroopen aukarant hi rahata he
 It is different that "Y" Shruti proceeds are also found in some of its areas

 like : ""karau chhora bolau"" -
 "" Carau Chora Bolou "" -
 ""karau launda bolgau"" -
 Kannauji has its own nature
 sangya, visheshan tathaa kriya ke roopon main brajabhasha jahaan aukarantata lekar chalati he vahaan kannauji okarantata kaa anusaran karti he
 In the district Braj language of Aligarh district, if we say "" Carou Chora Bolou "", then it will be said in Kannauji that - "" Say Caro Lurika
 bhavishyatkaleen kriya kannauji main tidhntaroopini hoti he, lekin brajabhasha main vah kridantarupini pai jaati he
 If we convert the words "boy will go" and "girl will go" into Kannauji and Brajbhasha, we will give the following form: kannauji main - larika jaihai
 Daughter is brajabhasha main - chhora jaigau
 Will be left
 uparyukt udaahranon se spasht he ki brajabhasha ke saamaanya bhavishyat kaal rup main kriya karta ke ling ke anusaar parivartit hoti he, jab ki kannauji main ek rup rahati he
 Apart from this, Kannauji also has a tendency to discolour like Awadhi, which is lacking in Braj Bhasha
 kannauji ke sangya, sarvnaam aadi vaakyapadon main sandhirahitya praaia: miltaa he, kintu brajabhasha main ve pad sandhigat avasthaa main milte hai
 Examples : kannauji -""bau gao"" 
 Brajbhasha - "" Bo Gayou ""
 uparyukt vaakyon ke sarvnaam pad "bau" tathaa "bo" main sandhirahitya tathaa sandhi kii avasthaaen donon bhashaaon kii prakrutiyon ko spasht karti hai
 Keeping in view the linguistic variation of the Braj Bhasha region, we can divide it as follows: kendriya braj arthath adarsh brajabhasha - aligarh, mathura tathaa pashchimi agre kii brajabhasha ko "adarsh brajabhasha" naam diya ja saktaa he
 This name can be given to the language spoken in the north west of Gwalior - Budeli influenced Brajbhasha
 rajasthan kii jaipuri se prabhavit brajabhasha - yah bharatpur tathaa uske dakshini bhaag main boli jaati he
 Sikarwadi Brajbhasha - This form of Brajbhasha is prevalent in the north east region of Gwalior where settlements of Sikarwad Rajputs are found
 jaadobati brajabhasha - karauli ke kshetra tathaa chambal nadi ke maidan main boli janevaali brajabhasha ko "jadobari" naam se pukaara gaya he
 There are settlements of Jadau Rajputs here
 kannauji se prabhavit brajabhasha - jila eta tathaa tehsil anupshahar evam atarauli kii bhashaa kannauji se prabhavit he
 The following examples are visible for how the district Braj language of Braj-speaking region has changed from west to east
 jila gudgaanv main - ""tamaso dekhne ku gaye
 You are getting angry with me
 tab gaano band ho gayo
 "" jila bulandshahr main -""launda gom ku ayu or bahu su bolgau kai main naukri ku jangau

 In 1976, the US National Academy of Sciences released a report, which concluded that the ozone depletion hypothesis was strongly supported by scientific evidence
 vaigyanikon ne yah gananaa kii ki yadi si epa si kaa utpaadan das pratishat kii jari dar ke saath 1990 tak badhata rahe or fir sthir ho jaae to si epa si 1995 tak ozon kii 5 se 7%haani kar chuki hogi or 2050 tak 30 se 50% haani kar chuki hogi
 In response, the United States, Canada, Sweden, and Norway prohibited the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans in 1978
 haalanki, rashtriya academy dwaara 1979 or 1984 ke bich anusandhan ke dwaara jari kii gai reporton main, yah pradarshit hota he ki vaishvik ozon haani ke praarambhik anumaan bahut adhik the
 Crutzen, Molina, and Rowland were awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on ozone in the stratosphere
 british antarctic surveykshan vaigyanikon farmaan, gardiner or shanklin ke dwaara antarctic "ozon chhidr kii khoj" vaigyanik samudaay ke liye ek aghat thi
 In May 1985
 ) kyonki dhruviya ozon main prekshit kami pratyaasha se bahut adhik thi
 Satellite measurements showing a massive ozone depletion around the South Pole were becoming available at the same time
 haalanki, inhen prarambh main data gunvattta niyantran elgoridam ke dwaara anuchit maanate hue asweekrut kar diya gaya ; ozon chhed ko keval upgrah aankadon main pataa lagaaya gaya jab kachche aankadon ko swasthani prekshanon main ozon riktikaran ke pramaanon ke liye punah jaancha gaya
 The ozone hole was traced back to 1976 when the software returned without a flag
 susaan sulaiman, jo rashtriya samudriya or vayumandaleey prashasan main ek vayumandaleey rasayanajna hai, unhone bataaya ki thande antarctic samtap mandal main dhruviya samtap mandal ke badal par rasinic abhikriya ke kaaran chlorine kii maatra main ek vishaal he, yadhyapi sthaneey or mausami vruddhi hoti he jo ozon ko nasht karti he
 Polar stratospheric changes in Antarctica are formed only when the temperature is reduced to −80 ° c and the initial conditions of spring
 aisi sthitiyon main, badal ke barf ke crystal niskriy chlorine yogikon ke sakriya chlorine yogikon main parivartan hetu upyukt sataha uplabdh karte hai jo ozon ko aasaani se nasht kar sakate hai
 In addition, the polar vortices formed over Antarctica are very tight and the reaction that takes place on the surface of the cloud crystal is very different from the reaction in the atmosphere
 in sthitiyon ne antarctic main ozon chhed kaa nirmaan kiya he
 This hypothesis was first conclusively ensured by laboratory measurements and then by direct measurements
 yah maapan bhu str se or fir oonchai se kiya gaya, is maapan main antarctic samtap mandal main chlorine monooxide kii ucch sandratha ko mapa gaya
 The alternative hypothesis, which clarifies the ozone hole for variations in UV radiation and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, was investigated and described as unstable
 is bich, bhu aadhaarit dobasan spectro-photo-meter ke vishwavyaapee network se ozon ke maapan kaa vishleshan kiya gaya isse yah nishkarsh niklaa ki ozon parat vastav main ushnkaribandheey kshetra ke baahar sabhi akshansh par nasht ho rahi thi
 These trends were confirmed by satellite measurements
 ek parinaam ke rup main, mukhya helocarbon utpaadak rashtron ne, siefasi or helon or sambandhit yogikon ke utpaadan par roak laga di, yah prakriya 1996 main puri hui
 Since 1981, the United Nations Environment Program has released a series of reports on the scientific evaluation of ozone depletion
 sabase haal hi ke prekshan 2007 se hai jahaan upgrah maapan ne darshaya ki ozon parat kaa chhed thik ho rahaa he or ab yah ek dashak main sabase chota rah gaya he
 Ozone depletion is not regarded as a more serious controversy in the scientific community
 vayumandaleey bhautikavidon or dawa vikritaon ke bik ek aam sahmati he ki vaigyanik samaj us str tak pahunch gai he jahaan CFC utsarjan ko niyantrit karne ke liye uthaaye gaye kadam uchit hai, yadhyapi niti nirmaataaon ke liye faisla antat ek hi hota he
 Despite this consensus, the science behind ozone depletion remains complex and those who are against emphasizing it point to some uncertainties
 udhaaharan ke liye yadhyapi you ve bi ke bade hue str ne melanoma ke jokhim ko badha diya he, sankhyikeey aankadon ke liye yah sthapit karnaa mushkil he ki ozon riktikaran or melanoma kii dar main vruddhi ke bich sambandh he
 Although melanomas increased significantly during the years 1970–1990, the ozone depletion effect is difficult to separate from the effects of changes in lifestyle factors
 yadhyapi ve aksar maas media main antar sambandhit kiye jate hai, global varming or ozon riktikaran ke bich sambandh prabal nahin he
 There are four areas of contact: ozon riktikaran ke bare main kam yaa adhik galatfahmiin ko yahan sankshipt main bataaya gaya he; adhik vistrut varnan ozon-riktikaran aksar puche jane vaale prashn main paaya ja saktaa he
 It is often said that since CFC molecules are heavier than nitrogen and oxygen, they do not reach the stratosphere in sufficient quantities
 lekin vayumandaleey gaison ko vajan ke dwaara pruthak nahin kiya ja saktaa he; vaayu ke bal itane prabal hote hai ki ye geson ko puri tarah se mishrit kar dete hai
 cfcs are heavier than air, but, like argon, krypton, and other heavy gases with long lifetimes, they are evenly distributed throughout the turbosphere and reach the upper part of the atmosphere
 aksasr mahasoos kii jane vaali aapattiyaan hai, ki saamanyatya yah mana jaataa he ki kshobh mandal kii chlorine ke prakritik strot, maanav nirmit sroton se pariman main chaar se paanch guna adhik hai
 While the bitter truth is that the chlorine of the troposphere is irrelevant, only the chlorine of the stratosphere is the cause of ozone depletion
 samudr spray se utpann chlorine ghulansheel he or is prakaar samtap mandal main pahunchne se pehle hi varsha ke jal main ghul jaati he
 In contrast, cfcs are insoluble and have a longer life span, which is why they reach the stratosphere
 yahan tak ki nichle vayumandal main si epa si ke rup main adhik chlorine upasthit he or sambandhit heloelken bhi upasthit hai, isaki tulana main lavan ke spray se utpann hone vaale hcl main chlorine kii maatra kam he
 Halocarbons become more effective in the stratosphere
 inamen se keval ek hi helocarbon, mithail chloride mukhya prakritik strot he, yah samtap mandal main 20 pratishat chlorine ke liye uttaradaayi he; shesh 80 pratishat maanav nirmit yogicon se aati hai
 Very large volcanic eruptions can release hcl directly into the stratosphere
 lekin pratyaksh maapan darshaate hai ki si epa si kii chlorine kii tulana main inkaa yogadan kam he
 a similar inaccurate claim is that soluble halogen compounds from the volcanoes of Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica are majorly contributing to the Antarctic ozone hole
 ji em bi dobasan ke anusaar basant ritu ozon str khatm hue, heley Bay kaa pehla maapan kiya gaya, unhen yah jaan kar aashcharya hua ki ye ~320 DU the, basant ke str se lagbhag 150 DU kam, yah arctic main ~450 DUWA
 However these were ozone holes prior to normal climatic values
 dobasan ke anusaar aadhaar rekha jisase ozon chhed ko mapa jaataa he: vaastavik ozon chhed kaa maan 150–100 DU kii range main he
 The difference Dobson saw between the Arctic and the Antarctic was time
 Ozone levels rose uninterrupted during the Arctic spring, peaking in April, while in the Antarctic it remained stable during the early spring, suddenly increasing in November, when the polar vortex broke
