 australia ke khilaaf ek-divasiy cricket shrunkhlaa ke saatven or nirnaayak match main bharat ko shanivaar ko apane ballebaajon se ek baar phir aatishi pradarshan kii ummid hogi
 After two matches washed away in rain in Ranchi and Cuttack, India registered a resounding victory by chasing a difficult target of 351 runs in Nagpur
 is jeet se bharat ko jaipur main mili jeet kii yaad taaja ho gai, jab bhartiya team ne 360 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha kiya tha, to ek-divasiy cricket ke itihaas main lakshya kaa peechha karte hue duusari sabase badi jeet thi
 There is a lot of pressure on the bowlers of both the teams on flat pitches which run out
 shrunkhlaa main abhi tak 2500 se adhik ran ban chuke hai
 Even the score of 350 runs is not enough and in Saturday's match, it is expected to score a mountain of runs at the Chinnaswamy Stadium
 australia ke tej gendbaaj mishael johnson is match main nahin khelenge, jo ashes shrunkhlaa kii taiyaari ke liye swadesh laut rahe hai
 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be hoping that his batsmen will maintain this rhythm
 bharat ke liye viraat kohli or salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan ne sarvaadhik ran banaae hai, jabaki dhoni ne madhyakram kii kaman sanbhali
 Opener Rohit Sharma has given India a good start with Dhawan
 dhoni khud mohali ke pradarshan ko doharaana chahenge, jahaan unhone shandaar shatak lagaakar bharat ko 300 se adhik ran kaa score diya tha
 However, Australia won it and won it
 bharat ke liye chintaa kaa sabab madhyakram kii ballebaaji he, kyonki suresh raina or yuvaraj singh abhi tak koi badi pari nahin khel sake hai
 Both have one more chance to forget past failures
 donon ko australian gendbaajon khaskar mishael johnson kii gati or oochaal ne pareshaan kiya he
 Dhoni has the option of giving Ambati Rayudu a place in the team, but the Indian camp might not want to tamper with the team combination
 gendbaaji main bhartiya gendbaaj ballebaajon kii madadgaar pich par koi prabhaav nahin chhod sake
 Off-spinner r Ashwin, who took 29 wickets in a four-test series against Australia, has been beaten fiercely by Australian batsmen, especially captain George Bailey
 nagpur main shrunkhlaa kaa apana pehla match khilne vaale leg spinner amit mishra ne 10 over main 78 ran de daale, lekin unhen koi wicket nahin mili
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Jaydev Unadkat and r Vinay Kumar have proved to be quite expensive
 dhoni ke paas yuvaraj singh or raina jaise aniyamit gendbaajon ko aajamaane kaa vikalp he, lekin nae vanade niyamon ke tahat fielding paabandiyon ne unke liye ise mushkil bana diya he
 Australia's batsmen have also performed well in the series
 beli ne bhartiya gendbaaji akraman kii khub dhajjiyaan udayi hai, jabaki shen watson ne pichley match main shandaar saikadaa jadaa
 The screen awards saw the 'silsila' of Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan and Rekha once again

 At the Screen Awards, Big b blossomed as soon as he saw Rekha

 Jaya Bachchan and Rekha also looked quite comfortable with each other during this period

 But the story did not end here
 photo main big bi ke thik peeche vaali seat par rekha baithi najar ain thim
 Although she was not looking at the camera, but still she could not escape from the eyes of the camera

 Sautani has become Saheli! There were reports that Huma Qureshi is the reason for the distance between Kalki Koechlin and Anurag Kashyap

 According to the report released on Friday, five days late, the information received in the media just before the official announcement of the schedule of the Karnataka assembly elections has been considered by the committee, not a leakage
 cameti kii nazaron main wo to tukka tha jo sahi sabit ho gaya
 In one place, the target was hit and in another place it proved to be wrong
 report main kaha gaya ki pehle bhi media anumaan lagaataa rahaa he
 There is nothing new in this
 isliye kuch news channelon or soshal media par prasaarit jaankaree tukka hi thi
 The date of voting in it turned out to be correct but the date of counting was wrong
 karnatakachunaav kaarykram ke licage par bavaal hone ke baad jaanch ke liye ayog ne ek cameti banaai
 Before the official announcement of the election program by the Election Commission, the committee called for a response from the broadcasters of the election program on social media and channels
 congress or bijepi ke netaaon, patrakaron, media gharaanon se jaankaree ikattha kii lekin nateeja vahi aayaa jiskaa andeshaa tha
 That is, yours too Jai Jai Hamari Bhi Jai Jai! The committee has mentioned in the report that the committee will discuss with the Commission separately the measures to be taken to strengthen the system of privacy in future

 On the one hand, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a big rally in Delhi's Ramlila Maidan on 22 January, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has also been gearing up for the election preparations
 bijepi or congress ke liye prachaar kaa kaam dekh chuke chunavi ranneetikaar prashanth kishor 20 disambar ko dilli main aam aadmi party kaa chunavi campan launch karenge
 AAP and ipac's shared campaign: Prashant Kishore will be seen campaigning for the Aam Aadmi Party for the first time
 aam aadmi party ke mukhyalay se shuukravaar ko dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ke saath prashanth kishor kii company ipake kaa saajha campan launch hoga
 The Aam Aadmi Party says that its own election preparations and campaigning will continue and Prashant Kishore's company will run the campaign campaign of Aam Aadmi Party keeping the brand Kejriwal ahead
 kaisaa hoga chunaav prachaar?aam aadmi party pichley 5 varshon main kejariwal sarkaar dwaara bijli, pani, shiksha, swasthya, sisitivi camere or mahilaon kii muft yatra ko pramukh mudda banaate hue arvind kejariwal ke chehre ko saamne rakhkar prachaar shuru karegi
 At the same time, the campaign of Prashant Kishore will be like a campaign, it will be revealed only on 20 December
 mana ja rahaa he ki prashanth kishor ke campan kaa laanch dilli ke upmukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke varisht netaa manish sisodiya karenge
 a major contest between the Aam Aadmi Party and BJP is expected in the Delhi Assembly elections
 bijepi anadhikrut coloniyon ko niyamitikaran ke mudde par chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar rahi he, lekin uske pehle hi aam aadmi party (AAP) ne anadhikrut coloniyon main dilli sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye kaam ko lekar puri rajdhani ko postaron se paat diya he
 In the body of the development of unauthorized colonies before the BJP in Rani, the Aam Aadmi Party wants to knock the BJP there too, not remaining behind
 kul milakar najar shuukravaar ko hone vaale aam aadmi party or ipake ke saajha champion par rahegi, jab dilli ke vidhansabha chunaav main pehali baar kisi chunavi management company ke prachaar kii tasviir dikhaai degi
 Held a high-level meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party regarding the selection of candidates for Haryana Assembly elections
 ek hi din main party ne duusari baar varisht netaaon kii baithak bulaai
 Earlier, the names of the candidates were being considered in the meeting that lasted for about two and a half hours in the morning
 tikat bantwaare ko lekar ho rahi baithak main bijepi daftar main party adhyaksh amit shah, kaaryakari adhyaksh jepi nadda, mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter, narendra singh tomars or anil jain samet party ke kai varisht netaa maujuud rahe
 However, the decision taken in this meeting has not been given yet

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also return from America before this meeting
 pradhanmantri modi vartmaan main america main hai, jo yuangie sahit kai antarrashtriya kaaryakramon main bhaag le rahe hai
 The BJP is likely to announce its list of candidates during Navratri
 ek anya kaaran yah he ki chunaav ayog ne donon rajyon ke liye namakan bharne kii antim tithi 4 oktober tay kii he
 This leaves very little time for the BJP and its allies to file nominations
 sutron kaa kahana he ki haryana ke liye ek suchi taiyaar he, jabaki bhaajapa ne maharashtra ke liye do suchi taiyaar kii he jis par nirnay hona he
 If there is no agreement with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, then the BJP is ready to go to the polls with smaller allies like Republican Party of India
 lekin bhaajapa ke ek ucch padasth sutara kaa kahana he ki shivasena va bhaajapa ke bich samjhaute kii ghoshnaa is saptahanth hone kii sambhaavna he
 In both the states, the district units of the BJP have sent their list to the respective state presidents, who have been involved in preparing the list in the state election committee meetings and forwarded it to BJP president Amit Shah
 vah is suchi ko kendriya chunaav samiti ke samaksh prastut karenge, jo is par antim faisla legi
 Apart from caste equations, popularity and social media influence, BJP is also looking at controversial statements of aspiring candidates
 bhaajapa sutron ne kaha ki kuch maujuuda vidhayakon ke media main die gaye 'anuchit' bayanon ne party ko ateet main mushkil main daal diya tha, unhen is baar tikat nahin diya ja saktaa he
 Elections for 228 seats in Maharashtra and 90 seats in Haryana are to be held on October 21
 donon rajyon main bhaajapa kii sarkarein hai or party ne ghoshnaa kii he ki vah apane maujuuda mukhyamantriyon ko dobaaraa avasar degi

 The situation is difficult, but the party will soon overcome it, the Congress will have to revive and transform itself, according to senior Congress leader and former Congress General Secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia
 unhone kaha ki kisi aisi shakhsiyat ko congress adhyaksh pad diya janaa chahie jo party main nai urja bhar party ko majboot kar sake or sabko khaastaur se desh ke party kaaryakarta ko saath lekar chal sake

 Will leave ' party adhyaksh ke mudde par unhone kaha "samay nikal chukaa he, ham isamen or samay nahin laga paaenge
 Already seven weeks have passed, we have to do jointly together
 ye samay nahin he ek ek congress jan ko apana agenda chalaane kaa ye samay he ek saath milakar sanyukt nirnay lenaa kaa
 "significantly, a poster demanding the appointment of Scindia as the AICC president was recently placed outside the Madhya Pradesh Congress headquarters in Bhopal
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad congress ke bhavishya ke bare main puche jane par, sindhiya ne kaha, “vartmaan main party ek gambhir sthiti se guzar rahi he
 The Congress must revive and strengthen itself to win the trust of the people
 mujhe lagata he ki vah kshan aa gaya he
 "he never batted on the back foot, but always on the front foot
" jo parinaam aae hai wo sar maathe hai, main kabhi is baat se parhez nahin kar saktaa ki aap main bhi kami thi, kami nahin hoti to ye nateeja kyon aata
 The first responsibility should be ours
 jahaan tak meraa parinaam he shaayad nahin zarur kami jyotiraditya sindhiya kii hogi, mujhe aatmavalokan karke kamiyaan dhundhani hogi
 On Rahul Gandhi's resignation as president, Jyotiraditya Scindia said, "this is a very serious time for the Congress
 hamane bahut koshish kii ki ham unhen manaa paae lekin wo koi faisla lete hai to adig rahete hai
 We are also proud of this
 lekin ab samay ho gaya he
 Now opportunity should be given to such a person who can revive the Congress
 ''congress main zimmedaari bujurg netaa ko mili yaa yuva is mudde par sindhiya ne kaha, "main modiji nahin hum, desh kii aabaadi ko puraane or main vibhajit na karen yuva

" bijepi kii sidhi soch he ki jahaan-jahaan unhen saamne ke daravaaje se pravesh na mili, vahaan peeche ke daravaaje se pravesh ho
 "the Congress leader said," The BJP has only one goal, "form government, have fun"

 Congress leader Scindia said that BJP has been trying to topple the elected government of Madhya Pradesh for the last six months

 naukarshahi nae vichaar de sakati he or nayaa kar sakati he, lekin antim nirnay mantriyon ko lenaa he
 No one (bureaucracy or minister) is above anyone, including the Chief Minister, but needs to work with team spirit

 This is a healthy tradition
 isse prajatantr ko koi haani nahin he
 Democracy will be stronger
 "har vyakti nyaay chahta he, sammaan chahta he har vyakti chahta he uski awaz suni jaae
 i believe this is a healthy tradition, would you like a government of Modiji where no one can say anything

 The way he is making the Madhya Pradesh Assembly an arena to save his existence by openly holding press conferences is not only a violation of constitutional dignity but is extremely unfortunate for the democratic system

 So the BJP also needed a face other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 maharashtra, jharkhand, haryana jammu-kashmir jaise rajyon main party kaa cheharaa matlab modi kaa cheharaa
 So did this formula change for Delhi
 modi ke saath ek or cheharaa yaa kiran bedi hi bijepi kaa cheharaa
 There will be questions, but the BJP has brought Delhi's politics to an interesting point
 ab is tasviir ko sepia tone main dekhiye
 What were those days when Kiran Bedi, Arvind Kejriwal, Anna Hazare all sang Lokpal Lokpal
 lekin tab bhi kai masalon par kiran bedi or kejariwal kii raay alag hua karti thi
 When Arvind Kejriwal demonstrated in front of Nitin Gadkari's house, Kiran Bedi opposed it
 maidan main kiran bedi kaa yah gusse vaala seen kaaphi mashhoor ho gaya tha
 Kiran Bedi was very angry
 nakaab chadhaakar or utarkar bijepi ke do bade netaaon kii taraf ishaara kiya tha ki yahaan kuch bolte hai or vahaan kuch or
 BJP leaders also criticized his actions
 baad main kya hua aap jaanate hai
 Arvind Kejriwal formed the party and Anna Hazare, Kiran Bedi, VK Singh parted ways with the idea of forming a political party
 wike singh ab centre main mantri hai or kiran bedi guuruuvaar shaam bhaajapa main shaamil ho gayi
 Anna Hazare escaped from politics
 ab wo us filmi seen kii tarah batch gaye hai yaa bhula die gaye hai jisamen ghar kaa mukhiya diwaar par tangi apane purakhon kii tasviir niharta rahata he
 The film scene also becomes real
 ab vaaki anna andolan kii jadon ko phir se laut kar dekhne kii zarurat he ki kahin ye kisi dizine ke tahat to taiyaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 But on the basis of these apprehensions, the movement that changed Delhi's politics at least in such a way that both the old parties have started making strategies according to the two-year party
 sepia tone se nikal kar ab aa jate hai eastman color main
 Will BJP make Kiran Bedi the candidate for Chief Minister? Party President Amit Shah said that the Parliamentary Board will decide who will be the Chief Minister's candidate, the party will decide and from where they will contest the elections
 bijepi saansad vijay goyal ne twit kar diya ki mujhe puraa bharosa he ki unke preranaday netritv main bijepi jeetegi or dilli kaa vikaas hoga
 Although there has not been a formal announcement in this matter, but will it be possible to see Kiran Bedi out of the frame of Arvind Kejriwal
 shaayad nahin
 National president Amit Shah and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley were also present to make his arrival at the BJP office bigger
 kiran bedi ne amit bhai or arun bhai kahkar sambodhit kiya
 He said that the Prime Minister gave him time to Amit Bhai and me even in the busy time, i am thankful for this
 unka ye inspireshnal leadership bahut saare bharatiyon ko badal rahaa he or agar aaj mere jaise vyakti ko badla he to main samajhati hum ki karodon badal chuke honge
 Kiran Bedi also told about social work from her police life and said that when i was not made a police commissioner, i took retirement from myself
 kyonki jo kaam mujhe diya gaya wo mere liye chalanging nahin the
 i do not work for the position, car, house and position
 lekin jo mujhe aaj may se prerana mili, ye pragati thi, ye evolution tha, evolving ho rahi thi, tab main apane aap ko samarpit kar duungi, apane larger desh ke liye, samay kii baat thi
 And the time has come
 unhone bataaya ki raajnneeti main aane kaa badlaav unke bheetar may maheene main narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke saath aane laga
 Kiran Bedi also said that i did not write this watch by hand
 upar vaala likhata he
 Now only Amit Shah and Prime Minister Modi can tell whether they set this time for Kiran Bedi or any of them above or the electoral compulsions of Delhi
 kiran bedi ne bhi apana ek sapana bataa diya
 The dream of making Delhi the number one capital of the world
 raajnneeti main prerana or sapana ye do mukhya tatv hai
 But his opponents were not dreaming politics
 unke shaamil hone kii khabaron ke saath hi twitor par unke puraane bayaan nikaale jane lage ki kab unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi par gujarat dangon ko lekar twit kiya tha, kab kaha ki bijepi vot dene laayak party nahin he, kab kaha tha ki congress or bijepi donon hi fund ke maamle main paardarshee nahin hai
 However, no one tweeted that he had made several tweets both in praise and recommendation of Prime Minister Modi
 arvind kejariwal ne swaagat karte hue kaha he ki main hameshaa chahta tha ki ve raajnneeti main aaen
 But other leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party started the attack
 kumaar vishwaas ne kaha ki yudhon main kabhi nahin haare, ham darate hai chal-chhandon se, har baar paraajay pai he apane ghar ke jayachandon se
 Now in these verses, the poet called Kiran Bedi as Jayachand, but did she also say that she had lost
 aam aadmi party ke ek or netaa mayank gandhi ne twit kiya ki kiran bedi ne bhi to dharna kiya tha, kya bhakt ye bataayenge ki ve naksal hai yaa nahin
 Here is what is said about the devout BJP supporters
 vishaal dadlani ne chutki lee kahin bijepi kejariwal se ghabaraakar obama ko hi party main shaamil na kara de
 Congress leader Ajay Maken has said that Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi have betrayed the objectives of the Anna movement
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki kiran bedi ke aane se dilli bijepi ko bahut majbooti milegi
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that Kiran Bedi ji has a name not only in Delhi but in the whole country
 sarkaar main bhi wo crusyder ke rup main ladati rahi hai
 So is the BJP going to surround Arvind Kejriwal on the basis of the old colleagues of the Anna movement and the old leaders of AAP
 yah wo ladaai he jise koi haath se jane nahin degaa
 In this battle of kerjiwal vs kiran, the boss will be tense
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki koun jitegaa
 She has been wandering in the streets of Delhi for two years or she has come to a party four weeks ago
 galakat pratiyogita he is baar dilli main
 Has BJP got a face in Delhi? arvind kejariwal ke liye kiran bedi ko gherna mushkil ho jayega
