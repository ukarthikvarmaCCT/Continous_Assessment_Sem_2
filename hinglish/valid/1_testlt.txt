 Considering the father's yagya, Sati reached without calling, but when she saw there that neither her husband's part was taken out nor she was entertained, so she died there
 When Mahadevji received this news, he produced a gana called 'virabhadra' from his jata to punish Daksha and his advisors
 virbhadra ne apane anya saathi ganon ke saath aakar daksh kaa sar kaat liya or uske saathiyon ko bhi puraa dand diya

 14
 
 Meaning- Shivji said that Jats are Mahabali, Maha Semenwan and very powerful
 In the earlier era of Kshatriya Prabhriti Kshitipals, this caste was the king and king on earth

In the beginning of the universe, the men born due to the influence of Veerabhadraji's Yogmaya by him and the daughter of Brahmaputra Daksha Maharaj, the Jat caste would arise, so it will become clear
 16 || arth- shankaraji bole he devi ! jat jati kii utpatti kaa jo itihaas he so atyant aashcharyamay he

 The magnitudes were in contrast to the numbers, which were bouncing from one value to another, such as 4 to 5
 The numbers are made up of some minimal, indivisible unit, while the magnitudes are infinitely reducible
 kyonki pariman ke liye koi maatraatmak mulyon ko nahin saunpa gaya tha, isliye yudoxs, sammey or asammey, donon anupaaton kii gananaa karne main sakasham hua jiske liye usne ek anupaat ko uske pariman or samaanupaat ke maamle main donon anupaaton ke bich ek samanta ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 Taking out the quantitative values from the equation, he saved himself from the trap of expressing an irrational number as a number
 "eudoxus' theory enabled Greek mathematicians to make unprecedented progress in geometry, providing the necessary rational basis for irrational proportions
" Euclid's Elements book 10 is devoted to the classification of irrational magnitudes
 madhya yug main, arab ganitagyon dwaara bijganit ke vikaas ne aparimey sankhyaon ko "bijiy vastuon" ke rup main prayog karne kii anumati di
 Arab mathematicians also merged the concept of "number" and "magnitude" into a more general notion of "real number", criticized Euclid's concept of proportions, developed the theory of overall proportions and the concept of numbers as continuous Expanded to magnitude ratio
 eliments kii pustak 10 par apni tippanee main farsi ganitagya al mahani ne dwighat aparimey or ghan aparimey kii jaanch kii or unka vargeekaran kiya
 He provided definitions for rational and irrational magnitudes, which he considered as irrational numbers
 usne unka istemaal mukt rup se kiya lekin unki vyakhya jyamitiya shabdon main kii jo nimnanusaar he: In contrast to Euclid's concept of magnitudes as lines, al-mahani considered integers and fractions as rational magnitudes, and square roots and cubic roots as irrational magnitudes
 He also introduced an arithmetic approach to the concept of irrationality, as he attributes the following to irrational magnitudes: misr kaa ganitagya abu kamil shuja ebn asalam pratham vyakti tha jisane aparimey sankhyaon ko dwighat sameekaran ke samaadhaan ke rup main yaa ek sameekaran main gunank ke rup main sweekaar kiya, jo aksar varg mul, ghan mul or chauthe mul ke swaroop main hota tha
 In the tenth century, the Iraqi mathematician al-hashimi provided general evidence for irrational numbers in the process of considering multiplication, division, and other arithmetic functions
 abu zafer al khazin, parimey or aparimey pariman paribhaasha pradaan karata he, yah kehete hue ki yadi ek nishchit raashi he: These concepts were consequently accepted by European mathematicians shortly after the 12th century Latin translation

 In the year 1872, several theories were published, including Karl Weierstrass, Hein, Georg Cantor, and Richard Dedekind
 In 1869 Meray took the same point of departure as Hein, but this theory is commonly cited from the year 1872
 viarastrus kii vidhi ko 1880 main puri tarah se selvator pincharle dwaara aage badhaayaa gaya, or dedekkind kii vidhi ko lekhak ke baad ke kaaryon or paul tenry ke samarthan ke madhyam se atirikt mahatv praapt hua
 Weierstras, Canter, and Hein based their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind put his bases on the notion of a deduction in a system of real numbers, under which he divided all rational numbers into two groups based on particular properties

 Continuous fractions, which are closely related to irrational numbers, received publicity at the hands of Euler and emerged more through Lagrang's writings in the early nineteenth century
 Dirichlet also contributed to general theory, as did many other contributors to the application of the subject
 lambert ne sabit kiya ki π parimey nahin ho saktaa or kaha ki e n tab aparimey hoga jab yadi n parimey he 
 jabaki lambert ke saboot ko aksar adhuraa kaha jaataa he, aadhunik akalan ise santoshjanak kah kar samarthan detaa he or vastav main apane samay ke liye yah asaamaanya rup se kathor he
 Legender, after introducing the Bessel – Clifford verb, provided evidence to show that π2 is irrational, which leads to the instantiation that π is also irrational

 baad main, jorj cantre ne ek bhinn tareeke se unke astitv ko sabit kar diya, jisamen darshaya gaya ki vaastavik main har antaraal main abijiy sankhya shaamil hoti he
 Charles Hermit first proved the e-algebra and Ferdinand von Lindemann showed the same for π, starting with Hermit's conclusion
 Lindemann's evidence was greatly simplified by Weierstras, later primed by David Hilbert and finally by Adolf Hurwitz and Paul Albert Gordon
 2 kaa varg mul vah pehali sankhya thi jise aparimey sabit kiya gaya or us lekh main kai saboot shaamil hai
 The golden ratio is the next most famous quadratic irrational and there is a simple proof of his irrationality in his article
 sabhi gaiyr-varg prakritik sankhya kaa varg mul, aparimey he or dwighat aparimey main ek pramaan dekha ja saktaa he
 The irrationality of a square root of 2 can be proved by assuming it to be rational and concluding a contradiction, called an argument by reductio ad absurdum
 nimnlikhit tark is tathy se do baar apil karata he ki ek visham purnank kaa varg hameshaa visham hota he
 If √2 is rational, its form is m / n for integers m, n, where both are not even
 phir m 2 = 2n 2, isliye m sam he, kah lijiye ki m = 2p 
 is prakaar 4p 2 = 2n 2 isliye 2p 2 = n 2 isliye n bhi sam he, jo ek virodhabhas he
 The above proof for the square root of two can be generalized using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which was proved in 1798 by Gauss
 isse yah bal miltaa he ki har purnank kaa abhajya main adwitiya gunankhandan hota he
 Using this we can show that if a rational number is not an integer, then its integral power cannot be an integer, because the denominator in its minimum term must have a factor that is not divisible by the numerator
 Be extended to any power
 So if an integer is not the exact kth power of another integer, then its kth square is irrational
 ve sankhyaayein jinhen sabase aasaani se aparimey sabit kiya jaataa he ve shaayad kuch khaas laghuganak he
 Here is a proof by reductio ad absurdum that log2 3 is irrational
 dhyaan den ki log2 3 ≈ 1
58> 0
 Suppose log2 3 is rational
 kuch dhanatmak purnank m or n ke liye, hamaare paas he it means that haalanki, sankhya 2 jise kisi bhi dhanatmak purnank ghaat main badhaayaa gaya ho use sam hona chahie or sankhya 3 ko jise kisi bhi dhanatmak purnank ghaat main badhaayaa gaya ho use visham hona chahie 
 jaahir he, ek purnank ek hi samay main sam or visham, donon nahin ho saktaa: hamaare paas ek virodhabhas he
 The only guess we made was that log2 3 is rational
 The contradiction means that this assumption must be false, ie log2 3 is irrational and can never be expressed as a quotient of integers m / n where n is ≠ 0
 log10 2 jaise maamalon ke saath bhi isi tarah kaa vyavhaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Almost all irrational numbers are transcendental and all transcendental numbers are irrational: the article with transcendental numbers lists several examples
 e r or πr aparimey hai agar r ≠ 0 parimey he; e π aparimey he
 Another way to construct irrational numbers is to construct irrational numbers as algebraic numbers, that is, as a polynomial with integer coefficients as zero: start with a polynomial equation
 jahaan gunank a i purnank hai
 Suppose you know that some real numbers x exist where p = 0
 The only possible rational root of this polynomial equation will be in the form r / s where r is a divisor of a 0 and s is a divisor of an; There are only a limited number of candidates that you can check with just hands
 agar unamem se koi bhi p kaa mul nahin he, to x zarur aparimey hona chahie
 For example, this technique can be used to show that x = 1 / 3 is irrational: we have 2 = 2 and therefore x 6 - 2x 3 - 1 = 0 and any rational in this latter polynomial
 Is not original
 kyonki bijiy sankhya ek kshetra gathit karte hai, kai aparimey sankhyaon ko bijiy or abijiy sankhyaon ke sangyojan dwaara nirmit kiya ja saktaa he
 For example 3π + 2, π + √2 and e √3 are irrational
 ek aparimey sankhya kaa dashamalav vistaar, ek parimey sankhya ke vipareet kabhi doharaata yaa samaapt nahin hota
 To show this, suppose we divide n integer by m
 When the longer part is applied to the part of n by m, only m remainder is possible
 yadi 0 ek sheshfal ke rup main prakat hota he, to dashamalav vistaar samaapt ho jaataa he
 If 0 never appears then that algorithm can run at most m - 1 step without using any remainder more than once
 uske baad, ek sheshfal kii punrariti honi hi chahie or tab dashamalav vistaar doharaata he
 Conversely, suppose we encounter a recurring decimal, then we can prove that it is a fraction of two integers
 udhaaharan ke liye: The length of the repeat is here 3
 ham 103 se guna karte hai: Note that when we multiplied by the length of the repeating part of 10, we moved the digits exactly to the left of the decimal point
 isliye, 1000A kaa pichhlaa sira bilkul a ke pichley sire se mail khaataa he
 Here, both 1000A and a have 162 repeats at the end
 isliye, jab ham donon pakshon se a ko ghataate hai, to 1000A kaa pichhlaa sira a ke pichley sire se baahar radd ho jaataa he: Again

 antim pankti, 53 / 74, purnankon kaa ek bhagfal he or isliye ek parimey sankhya he
 Here is a well known pure existence or non-creative proof: vahaan do aparimey sankhyaayein a or b maujuud hai, is prakaar ki a b parimey he
 In fact, if √2√2 is rational, then suppose a = b = √2
 Otherwise, assume that a is an irrational number √2√2 and b = √2
 Then ab = √2 = 2√2 · √2 = √22 = 2 which is rational
 haalanki uparyukt daleel donon maamalon ke bich nirnay nahin karti, gelpond-shnyder prameya kaa taatpary he ki √2√2 abijiy he, isliye aparimey he
 It is not known whether π + e or π - e is irrational or not
 vastav main, vahaan gaiyr-shunya purnank m or n kaa koi yugma nahin he jiske bare main yah gyaat ho ki kya m π + ne aparimey he yaa nahin
 Furthermore, it is not known whether the set q is independent according to algebra
 yah gyaat nahin he ki kya 2e, πe, π√2, katalan nirantar, yaa yuler-meshcheroni gamma nirantar γ aparimey hai yaa nahin
 Since the real constitutes an uncountable set, the rational of which is a countable subset, the complementary set of irrationals is uncountable
 saamaanya sudur kriya d = |x - y |, vaastavik sankhya ek metric spes he or isliye ek sansthitikeey spes bhi he
 Limiting the Euclidean remote function gives the irrational the structure of a metric space
 chunki aparimey kaa upspes band nahin he,utprerit metric purna nahin he
 However, with the G-delta set in a complete metric space - ie a countable intersection of open subsets - the irrational space is topologically complete: that is, a metric over the irrational that induces exactly the same topology as the Euclidean
 Restricts the metric, but with respect to which are irrational absolute
 ek vyakti G-delta set ke bare main upar ullikhit tathy se anbhigya rahete bhi ise dekh saktaa he: ek aparimey sankhya kaa satat bhinn vistaar, aparimey ke sthaan se sabhi dhanatmak purnank ke sthaan tak ek homeomorfizam ko paribhaashit karata he, jise aasaani se purna rup se metric yogya dekha jaataa he
 In addition, the set of all irrationals is a truncated metric space

 This dynasty arose after the fall of the Ghaznavi dynasty

 The famous Qutub Minar of Delhi is built by Qutub-ud-din Aibak of this dynasty, who also established the Delhi Sultanate
 is rajvansh ke patan ke baad iran main khwaaresm shah rajvansh or uttar bharat main dilli sultanate ke ghulaam rajvansh ne isaki jagah lee
 Before the mid-12th century, the Ghori Sardar remained under the Ghaznavis and Saljuqs for 150 years
 is kaal ke ant tak gazanvi swayan saljuqon ke adheen ho chuke the
 In 1148–1149, when a local Ghori leader named qutb-ud-din came to seek refuge after a family quarrel, the Ghaznavi ruler Bahram Shah killed him with poison
 badalen main ek duusare gori sardaar alaa-ud-deen hossain ne gazanaa par hamalaa kara or use 7 dinon tak lutaa or jalaakar raakh kar daalaa
 After this he came to be known as 'jahansoz', which means 'jahan / One who sets fire to the world'
 iske saath hi gazanvi samrajya khatm hone laga
 The Ghaznavis regained control of Ghazni with the help of the Saljuqs, but soon lost them to some Oguz Turkmanic herds who had threatened to come here from the northeast direction by losing their lands kara-khitan Khan
 1152 main alaa-ud-deen jahansos ne saljuqon ko kar dene se manaa kar diya or firophakoh se faujen badhaai lekin saljuqon ke shaasha, sultan ahamed sanger, ne use haraa diya
 Sultan Sanjar held Ala-ud-din captive for a while but then released

 Ala-ud-din Jahansoz held two of his nephews - Shahab-ud-din and Ghiyas-ud-din - before his death, but was released by Saif-ud-din
 saljuqon ne jab is kshetra par qabza kiya tha jo unhone saif-ud-deen kii patni ke zevar bhi le liye the
 One day after assuming the throne, Saif-ud-din saw a local chieftain wearing this jewel and killed him in a fit of breath
 jab mritak ke bhai ko kuch mahino baad mauqaa mila to usne saif-ud-deen ko badale main bhaalaa marakar maar daalaa
 Thus Saif-ud-din's reign lasted only around a year
 giyaas-ud-deen nayaa shaasha bana or uske chote bhai shahaab-ud-deen ne uskaa rajya vistaar karne main uski bahut vafadaari se madad kari
 Shahab-ud-din captured Ghazna first, then Multan and Uch in 1175 and then Lahore in 1186
 jab uskaa bhai 1202 main mara to shahaab-ud-deen mohammad gori sultan ban gaya
 In 1206 Muhammad Ghori was killed by a Rajput clan named Khokhar on the banks of the river in the Jhelum region of modern Pakistan to avenge attacks on him
 mohammad gori kaa koi betaa nahin tha or uski maut ke baad uske samrajya ke bhartiya kshetra par uske preeya ghulaam qutub-ud-deen aibak ne dilli sultanate sthapit karke uskaa vistaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 The control of the Ghurids in Afghanistan and other areas could not be saved and the Khwarezmi Empire captured them

 Sometimes it is also called Paramiriyad in English, which literally means every ten thousand
 lekin in donon ko shabdon kaa prayog ek samaan nahin he or parmyriad sambhawatah pareshaani khadi kar saktaa he
 For example, if one is increased by 10 basis points, it is generally assumed that the result will be 11 basis points; But if used interchangeably, the permyriad is potentially confusing because an increase of one basis point to a 10 basis point value is generally understood to mean an increase to 11 basis points; not an increase of one part in ten thousand, meaning an increase to 10
001 basis points
 parmyriad ko ‱ chihn se pradarshit kiya jaataa he, jo ki dikhne main "pratishat" ke chihn ke hi samaan he kintu ant main do shunya ke chihn adhik hai
 The definition of a basis point is as follows: aadhaar ank kaa upyog adhiktar ese sandarbh main suvidhajanak tareeke se kiya jaataa he jahaan ek pratishat se kam ke interval par vichaar kiya janaa ho
 a prime example of this is interest rates in financial markets in which fluctuations can typically be less than one percent
 ese main aadhaar ankon main baat karnaa adhik suvidhajanak hota he
 That is, a difference of 0
10% will be called a change of 10 basis points
 udhaaharan ke liye yah vyaktavy dekhen- repo dar main 25 aadhaar ankon kii badhotaree karte hue ise 7
5 pratishat se 7
75 pratishat kiya
 In other words, 100 basis points would mean one percent
 Like percentage points, basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate
 For example, if a report says there has been a "1% increase" from a 10% interest rate, this could refer to an increase either from 10% to 10
1%, or from 10% to 11% 
 If, however, the report says there has been a "100 basis point increase" from a 10% interest rate, then we know that the interest rate of 10% has increased by 1
00% to an 11% rate
 It is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument, or the difference between two interest rates, including the yields of fixed-income securities
 Since certain loans and bonds may commonly be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security, they will often be quoted as a spread over the index
 For example, a loan that bears interest of 0
50% per annum above the London Interbank Offered Rate is said to be 50 basis points over LIBOR, which is commonly expressed as "l+50bps" or simply "L+50"
 The term "basis point" has its origins in trading the "basis" or the spread between two interest rates
 Since the basis is usually small, these are quoted multiplied up by 1 xxrep 4 0 , and hence a "full point" movement in the "basis" is a basis point
 Contrast with pips in FX forward markets
 The relationship between percentage changes and basis points can be summarized as follows: 1 percentage point change = 100 basis points, and 0
01 percentage points = 1 basis point
 So, a bond whose yield increases from 5% to 5
5% is said to increase by 50 basis points; or interest rates that have risen 1 percentage point are said to have increased by 100 basis points
