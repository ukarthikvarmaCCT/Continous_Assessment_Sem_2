 Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel phogiyon kii pension kii tulana saamaanya sarkari karmchaariyon se nahin kii ja sakati kyonki ek ore jahaan sainya adhikari varg or saamaanya sarkari karmchaaree ko 60 saal tak tankhwaah lene kii suvidha milti he, vahiin sainik kaksha ke jawaano ko saal main hi ritair hona padataa he or unki sarvice ke halaat bhi adhik kathin hote hai
 In the British era, the pension of soldiers of the military class was about 80 percent of the salary, while that of the military officer and general government employee was 33 percent
 The Government of India did not consider this to be correct and since 1957, the pension of soldiers was reduced and started increasing the pension of other areas
 sena main bharti huve prayek jawan ne azaad bharat ke naagarik hone ke baavjood apane maanavadhikaar or sanvaidhanik mul adhikaar swechha se tyaage

 And on this side the former officers are not ready to accept that the ex-servicemen are no longer their slaves and the former soldiers and their families have the right to equal service and respect

 The first fight should be of self-respect, to end discrimination

 phogiyon kaa kahana he ki asli santulan laana he to hamen bhi 60 saal par ritair kiya jaay
 hamen to 33 saal pe hi ritair kar diya jaataa he or uske baad sara jivan ham pension se hi gujaarte hai
 jabaki anya karmchaaree 60 saal tak puri tankhwaah pate hai
 aise main hamaari pension ke pratishat ko kam nahin karnaa chahie
 However, at this time these soldiers only want to implement the Sixth Pay Commission and give equal pension to the soldiers who have served the same post and same time, even if both have retired in any year
 If this scheme is implemented, then about 25 lakh soldiers or their families will benefit
 For this, the government will have to bear an additional burden of about 9,000 crore rupees every year
 medal vaapasi geng or rashtradroh Nobody has returned the Paramvir Chakra yet, Mahavir Chakra has not returned, Shaurya Chakra has not returned, know why

 Of the 273 medals awarded on 26 January 2014, 231 officers, 11 jcos and 31 medals of NCCO and other ranks, 64 officers out of 105 Gallantry Awards, 11 jcos and 30 medals of ncos and other ranks are now given to soldiers
 It is to be wondered whether Shaurya is the only 3% of the army officers' fraternity? Are 97 percent of the army men and soldiers not brave? Does this country only recognize the martyrdom or valor of officers? kya jab bhi sena kaa ek vir desh ke liye apratim veerta or kaushalya dikhaata he to use medal ke liye ricomend hi nahin kiya jaataa? medal kya sirf kechap karnal ko hi die jate he? doston medal vaapasi gang or bhartiya sashastr senaao main medalon ke aabantan main paardarshita kaa abhaav ke bich kaa mail milaap aaiye milakar samaje
 If any band has actually received a medal in the security of the country
 wo kabhi raashtra kaa diya huwa sammaan van rank van pension yaa phir 2 xxrep 4 0 ₹ ke liye vaapis nahin karegaa
 Are all these ketchup colonels? Those who have taken their medals and medals on the martyr of a soldier

 The children of some of these retired colleagues are television journalists

 How to get it back ?? How did the situation of the former soldiers improve today? samaan military sarvice pe or samaan disability pension On the second day of the surgical strike, in October 2016, a special disciple of Genset Shri Satbir Babu wrote an article in rediff dot com, "the government's gift to the soldiers after the surgical strike cuts the disability pension !!" meri samaj main ye nahin aa rahaa he kii jab phaayde kii baat aati he to kuch khaas afasar bandhu apane aap ko “sainik” “jawan” in sab naamo se ullekhate he

 Disabled soldiers are destitute and are eating at rates

 In the new pay commission, the pension of the officer brothers has now been exceeded
 kuch logon ne disability pension ko basic se jodakar lakhon rupaye kamaane kaa nayaa tarika irzad kiya tha
 In some of our former officers, this trend is very dangerous that as soon as the opportunity is available, heat the market of Afwans, and howsoever you can distort things only for the financial benefit of the officers
 purv sainik bhaaion yah ladaai keval “ek samaan military sarvice pe” or “ek samaan disability pension” kii hi nahin he
 This is the battle of millions of soldiers and former soldiers like me, who we have to fight every day continuously, with the hope that one day the true soldier Swaraj will come
 sampoorn sainikswaraj gandhiji ke shabdon main My dear officer brother, ‘aap usee kaa fal paa rahe he jo aapane aaj tak boyaa he

 Gandhi's Swaraj to commemorate the complete independence of soldiers

 If not one or the other stone will break it
 mitti ke ghade ko tuutane se bachaane ke liye use agni main taapana utana hi zaruri he, jitna zaruri he use pathar se dur rakhana
 7
 Sainik Swaraj is that every less educated senior junior soldier should get as much respect as every Indian should get
 "tera bhi vatan meraa bhi vatan" 8
 Sainik Swaraj is an honor for all Indians, whether they are soldiers or if the officer gets the same amount of promotion
 vetanmanon main bhedbhaav na ho
 9
 The officers who get very high pay scale and pension should stop looting the country with new methods like NFU, OROP, TIMESCALE
 jab ek purv sainik kii vidhwaa 3500 ₹ main apana guzar basar kar rahi he tab ye luutere angarez 65000 se le kar 15 xxrep 4 0 rupaye main bhi santosh nahin paa rahe

 The officers call themselves soldiers xxrep 5 ! Then if you are a soldier then why discrimination against soldiers xxrep 4 ? On one side, all these honors pension OROP medal should become a soldier
 11
 phir jab pension,oropi,pe kamishan sevedari MSP NFU TIMESCALE in sabake samay tumhaara andar kaa sainik mar jaataa he
 The fallen devil thinks that what has gone to my father's money is the tax payer's money

 When it comes to providing basic and statutory rights to the soldier, communist salary, equal civil facilities such as clubs and golf courses in the canteen and a line one to the government quarters and facilities in the hospital, the rank of the youth and their families
 Remind them of their status
 14
 sainikswaraj main afasar bhaaiyo kii bhi utani hi bhagidaari he jitani hamaari
 If the officers leave the British and embrace Hindustaniyat, as well as adopt the companionship of their soldiers in Singapore United States of America like Mulco's army o and the officer of Waha
 15
 sabhi sainiko ko seva ke dauraan di jaarhe shiksha or pramaan patro main bhedbhaav karke unhen farzi pramaan patr na die jaye
 All these evil intentions of the officers are to keep the soldiers away from their greatest education
 sainikswaraj kaa arth he bharat main manyata praapt shiksha sansthaanon se saare senaao ke abhyaaso ko hi talim main gina jaye
 16
 Swaraj is the empowerment of every Hindustani
 swaraj he skill india
 Swaraj is an honor for 60 percent of soldiers to be promoted by promotion
 17
 sainikswaraj he sainik or afasar donon ke yuddh yaa anya samay main ghayal yaa aahat hone par samaan sammaan mili
 Whether the Gallantry Award, medal allocation, disability pension or pension allocation to the widow of a martyr is discriminatory in these places is unforgivable
 yahan swaraj turant hi laayaa jaye
 18
 Bapu said that unless we remove the British from inside India, then even if the English go away, what is the use ?? 19
 ye bhedbhaav jhooth aadambar asaty chori bhrashtachar ek ek bhartiya ke man se dur hoga tabhi aayega sachcha sainikswaraj
 20
 Gandhiji had said that if the British adopt Indian cultural values such as respect and coordination then we will accept them as Indians
 21
 dar se mili chiz tabhi tak kaayam rahegi jab tak dar rahegaa
 Give us the power of mind and win the mind
 dusron kii jai se pehle khud ko jai karen
 Give us the power of mind
 bhedbhaav, bhedbhaav apane dil se saafe kar saken
 Forgive me if you forget from friends
 jhooth se bache rahen, sach kaa dam bhare
 Hail yourself before the victory of others
 ham ko man kii shakti dena man vijay karen
 Hail yourself before the victory of others
 ham ko man kii shakti dena
 If there are difficulties, do so much work on us, if we support you with religion, if we go on religion, be encouraged by ourselves, do not be afraid of bad things

 Hail yourself before the victory of others

 Your native gorwal vetan ayog or visangatiyaan In the Army, from the time of the Third Pay Commission, ie from 1974 to the seventh Pay Commission of 2016, the pay scales of the soldiers and jcos have always been discriminated against because we are always silent as a disciplined soldier and yes our top officers are very sensitive to our problems and salary discrepancies
 Always remain indifferent 


 Why? Because his post-retirement ambition could only be overcome when he himself remained silent and kept his subordinate soldiers in the name of discipline and suppressed their voice
 The soldiers had a problem and the soldiers could not open their mouths, so whatever these top level officers, given by the government to the army soldiers, considered and accepted more than their status, that is, they considered the status of a soldier as less than a civilian employee and It is a matter of fact that the salary of a soldier is much less than the salary of the constables of the police of Delhi and Chandigarh
 Should the level of army soldiers be lower than the level of constables xxrep 4 
 After all, at what level did the pay commission undermine the army below the level of police 


 If this situation prevails, then the next level of the army will be equal to home guards 
 The truth is that in the last nearly five Pay Commission recommendations, they completely distanced themselves from the army level and their pay discrepancies, due to which the army was disillusioned with these pay commissions
 Today, soldiers are forced to retire at a young age to live the life of Mufalis and are forced to sit at Jantar Mantar with their legitimate demands
 With the help of some blurred memories, i am writing below the brief details of the salary discrepancies of the last five Pay Commission due to the trivial thinking and indecision of the army personnel

 In the Fourth Pay Commission which came into force in 1986, there was an attempt to make the army personnel and civilian employees almost equal, like the pay scale of the jawan also started from 935 / - and the Betan of the Lower Division Clerk was also from 950 / - but then Another game was played that the annual increase of the jawan was 15 / - while the lower division of the clerk was kept at 25 / - i

 the army and civilian employees were given an equal pay scale, but the army was free
 Are not open have been significant differences in habit led to repeat their allowances and annual increase has gone down significantly in the pension he compared the time civilian employees retirement led to or were too far behind in Punrribijn
 Because at that time this discrimination was limited only to the salaries of the jcos and jawans of the army, so the officers did not pay much attention to it
 In today's date, when the government and the bureaucrats played together with the officers and lowered the level of the army officers from the officers of the police and paramilitary, now the top officers of the army started having severe pain
 And from the Minister of Education to the Prime Minister, they are roaming around

 xxrep 5 ! As a result of all these results, in the Pay Commission's decision to be held after every ten years, we soldiers always went further down in our pay scale and the pension received and our officers did not understand at that time
 This will prove to be very fatal for our army and it happened also where the soldiers continued to get frustrated about their salary and allowances and the reason for this is that they have their own Irsh officers seals and indifference jcos and believed to be desperate to own this ambition means Snbadhanik office receives award after retirement
 ab bhi samay he ki jaag jaaon or swaarth se upar uthakar puure sainik sanghathan kii aawaaj ko majbootee do
 tino senadhyakshon ne vetan ayog kii report ko maujuuda sthati me asweekaar kar diya he tathaa sarkaar se ek baar phir bisangatiyon ko dur karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 hame apni ladaayee khud milakar ladani hogi kyonki yah bhi ek karm yuddh he or mahabharat ke shrikrishna kaa dharmayuddh he jahaan par dhoort or beyimaan logon kaa sarvanaash nishchit he
 hame dukh is baat kaa nahi he ki hamaare vetan visangatiyo ko sarkaar ne kyon nahi dur kiya hame dukh tab hota he jo sarkaar desh par jaan qurbaan karne ko taiyaar sainikon kii jaij maango par adiyal rabaiya apanaatihai wohi sarkaar civillian karmchaariyon kii anushaasanheenata or hadtaal karne kii dhamkee ke aage ghutane tech detii he or unki jaij or nazaij maange sab maan leti he
 aakhir sainik kaa bhi apana ghar or parivaar hota he jisaki bhi usee tarah kii jaruratein hoti he jaisi anya civil karmchaariyon kii hoti he
 Discrimination even in ration !! aakhir kyon nahi ham bhartiya sena me angrejon kii banaayi huyi dwi stareey bhojan vyavastha badal sake jabaki desh aaazaad huye bhi 70 barsh ho chuke he or ham abhi bhi angrejon kii banaayi huyi vyavastha ko hi aage dhote chale ja rahe he
 Perhaps Indian military officers do not even know why the kitchen and residence of British officers were different from Indian soldiers
 mai isi mudde ko is forum me uthaanaa chahta tha ki aakhir ghar me chaaron ore se khidkiya band karke parde daal kar dhakne se baahar ke logon kii najar se andar kii cargujariyon par to pardaa daalaa ja saktaa he lekin andar ke logon kii haalat najarband gulaamon se badtar hoti jaati he
 Till such time the system is not transparent then such problems will come again and again
 aakhir hamaari sena ke andar kaig dwaara audit kyon nahi karaayaa jaataa
 After all, why did our system become the reason for the cag's warning despite the three-tier audit
 hamaari tristareey audit vyavastha kisi he or koun si he
 Unit Audit, Local Audit and Test Audit These three fail completely because there have been big scams and are happening continuously
 duniyaan ke paanch deshon ke alaava kisi bhi desh me sena me teen tarah ke alag alag bhojanalay nahi hote or na hi sainik yaa sainik adhikariyon ke rashan kii maatra or gunvattta me bhedbhaav nahi he par yahaan he
 Even where there was discrimination, this system was abolished in those countries, but in India, this system made according to the convenience of the British continues even after seventy years of independence of the country
 isse bhedbhaav or asantosh failata he
 Just consider why the officers' restaurants were different from the restaurants of the soldiers
 uske do mahatvapurn kaaran the jinako aaj ke samay me auchitypurna nahi tehraaya ja saktaa he
 The first reason was that the British were officers and the Indians were low level officers and soldiers and the food and habits of the British were different
 jaise vah bread vater yani unka bhojan 70% radimaid or packed food hota tha jo bidesh se yaa britain se hi aata tha or jinka pement khud angrej afasar apane vetan se karte the royal indian army ke bajet se pement nahi hota tha
 But the food and eating habits of Indian soldiers were completely Indian and they needed fresh food which could be made mainly in Indian kitchens
 duusari baat yah he ki angrej adhikari gaay or suar donon kaa maance khate the jo bhartiya sainiko kii rasoi me nahi ban saktaa tha
 The third thing was that they had a separate restaurant because their food was not free, whereas the ration of the soldiers was absolutely free, and because of the arrangement that no officer from the free ration could manage food for himself, so an on duty officer Except an official was prohibited from going to Indian kitchen
 aaj k paristhitiyon me jabaki saare adhikari or sainik bhartiya he, khaane kii aadate bhi bhartiya he or rashan bhi bhartiya he tathaa dono ko bilkul muft he to bhojan kii maatra or gunvattta donon ko ek jaisi honi chaiye or ek jagah hi sabakaa bhojan bananaa chaiye or beshak khaane kaa dining teble alag alag ho
 
 
 
 jaise kisi bhartiya restaurant me miltaa he
 Is such a system possible and not possible in the Indian Army, at any time, the cries of unity in this country will remain confined only to the speeches or even in the manifestos
 yah mere nijee bichaar he tathaa ho saktaa he ki kuch logon ko yah vyavastha parivartan pasand na aaye
 But system change is also the need of the hour and such changes have been happening from time to time
 is tarah se desh ke andar bhi kaaphi kuch badlaav kii jarurat he jaise ki saansadon ko paanch barsh kaa kaarykaal ke babajood pension vyavastha kyo ?? After all, when the government itself stopped the old pension system of all central and state employees from April 2004, then on what basis can this MP and Bidhak be justified? mai chahta hum is tarah ke mudde ham sab log nijihit tyaag kar deshhit or janhit ke bare me sonchakar is forum ke jariye janata kii shashakt aabaaz banakar har manch par uthaane ko taiyaar rahe tab hi hamaare asli uddeshy kii poorti hogi

 kuch aatmanirikshan ke baad do chaar khaas baat saamne aati hai jo is sabake liye jimmedaar rahi
 1) The people of society, religion and government should fulfill their responsibility and duty and do not work and concentrate on how to make the whole system so that all the rubbish will continue to come to them and whatever they want
 No matter how unworthy he may be the successor, for this, he has to do anything and by crossing all the limits of greed to become in control of the whole system to such an extent that the whole system is heap Danced 2) jatigat vyavastha kaa sthaayee ho janaa jisame kaam badalane kii thodi bahut bhi swatantraaa naa ho

 It has some dimensions, such as 1) pehali nishaani ye hoti he ki unchi or nichi jati ke rahane, khaane ,khilne or samaaroh kii alag alag jagah hoti he
 2) The lower caste people will cook food, put tent, place banquet in their ceremony etc
 They will see their financial arrangements but cannot attend the ceremony
 lekin agar k bhi nashe main dhut manodasha main ki si unchi jati vaale ne kabhi kisi samaaroh main kaam karne vaale ko daaru yaa khaane ke liye puch liya to puure samaaj main taareef karata rahegaa
 3) The lower caste person will have a crate of responsibilities on his head and his legs will be wide but he will not have the rights
 agar wo yatha sambhav tareeke se bhi apni jimmedaari nibhaa rahaa to bhi kya he paise puure nahin le rahaa he kya? lekin agar galati se bhi galati ho jaye tosarvajaanik taur pe gaali galoch ke saath dhamkaaya ja saktaa he
 4) Even if a family gathering was organized, it would be ensured that separate arrangements for access, seating, utensils etc
 would be maintained for both groups
 kisi bhi saamaajik prasang main unchi jati vaala kisi baat yaa bina baat dhamka saktaa he jiske do parinaam honge ek to us samay wo sahamaa hua apamaanit mahasoos karegaa dusre uskaa aatmavishvaas sadaa ke liye kam rahegaa or saamaajik prasango main vah bechaara konaa dhundta or bagale jhaankta nazar aayega ki koi kahin kuch suna na de
 It will be expected from the lower caste that as he comes, he will bow with salute and not only his hands but his whole body will stand together
 5) unchi jati vaale ko agar apana kaam bhi naa pataa ho to bhi jhuthe bharose main rahaa jo desh or samaaj ke liye bhaar hi rahaa jabaki sambhavit kshamta ke saath usamen purnataa kaa tha
 Despite being low-caste capable, he remained a discouraged productive capacity holder for the system and system
 or apane vajood ko lekar kabhi suvidha main nahin balki duvidha main hi rahaa
 6) The result of all this is that a large part of our society continued to be less fertile and jugular and the entire country society and system suffered its brunt

 yadi software ke liye paisa nahin milegaa to kaam kaise chalegaa| tab vyapaaree varg ko aisa laga ki free software bekaar he or unhone ise apane se bahut dur rakhaa
 Although money can also be earned from free software, but its method is somewhat different, but there was such a stampede on the free software that the business class started shying away from adopting those other methods too

 There is a difference between the two, but the relationship is also deep
 free software se hi yah sab shuru hua he isaliye aise software ko Free Open Source Software yaa chote main FOSS kaha jaataa he
 Here the word free means freedom, but the word free also means without money, so the use of the word free puts you in some circles

 linus torwaldas, jo linaks ke janmdata hai, ne apni jeevani david dimond ke saath likhi he
 Its name is 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary'
 This is a very good book and reading it motivates us to move forward in life
 He says about open source software in this book, ‘the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest won’t be excluded from its development
 


 So open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It's still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people’s rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that doesn’t mandate legal protection for such secrecy
’ When we are talking about some benefits in open software, it would be very good to see some other side too
 Bill Gates is the father of Windows
 unhone ‘the Road Ahead’ pustak likhi he
 This book is also very good

 In this, they describe the shortcomings of free software in this way, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
' It is difficult to say which way the software industry will go but many countries and business houses of the world are making open source software their part
 ham is samay ek doraahe par khadey hai or ek aisi sthiti main hai ki soochna pradyogiki ko nayaa mode de sakate hai

 parantu badshaah kii yah sainya kaarywai karne kii himmat nahin hui
 He kept trying to please the Syed
 ant main saiyadon ne badshaah se jaisingh ko dilli se jane ko kahalava diya

 saiyadon ne jaisingh ko 20 lakh rupee diye, jisase ve amer vaapis brahmanon se waapas khariden

 While returning, Deep Singh also met the Nizam, but in September 1730, his agreement with Malwa was not resolved
 buddhasingh bundi or unki kushwahi rani ke aapas main gambhir matbhed paidaa hone par jaisingh ke sambandh bhi bundi naresh buddhasingh se bahut kharaab ho gayi
 In the end, the relations deteriorated so much that Jai Singh made the King of Bundi the king of Salim Singh Hada of Karwar in place of Buddha Singh, and called him the king, and later married his daughter
