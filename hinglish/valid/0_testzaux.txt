 They dissolve heat, salt in water
 yadi praapt amla ko or adhik nirjalit karnaa ho, to usamen kuch phosphorus pentoxide daalkar hilaate hai or drav kaa pun: aswan kar lete hai
 The commercial method of making prussic acid is: Sulfuric acid is reacted on an aqueous solution of 23% sodium cyanide inside a generator with lead levels and condensates the vapors obtained by this action
 is kriya ke antargat amla kii maatra ko cynide kii maatra se adhik rakhaa jaataa he
 Partial distillation of the liquid thus obtained gives prusic acid of about 98% concentration
 isi prakaar sodium cynide ke sthaan par calcium cynide lekar bhi ise praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In Germany, a significant amount of this acid is also made from molasses obtained from the sugar beet industry
 in vidhiyon ke atirikt sanshleshan dwaara bhi prusik amla praapt kiya jaataa he
 There are two major methods for this
 pehali vidhi main kisi hydrocarbon tathaa ammonia ke mishran kaa niyantrit oxikaran kiya jaataa he
 a hot mixture of methane, ammonia and a small amount of oxygen, flows over the lattice of platinum-iridium
 nimnlikhit kriya ke falswaroop prusik amla praapt ho jaataa he : Other hydrocarbons may also be used in place of methane, but the reaction is much better than methane
 farmamide ke nirjaleekaran dwaara bhi prusik amla banaaya ja saktaa he
 The vaporized formamide was mixed with a large amount of ammonia and 360 ° c above the catalyst, aluminum phosphate
 Heating is carried on: uparyukt sameekaran rasinic kriya pradarshit karata he
 The pricic acid thus formed is absorbed in a sodium hydroxide solution, which is obtained as sodium cyanide

3v10-2 he, jo carbonic amla ke viyojan sthiraank kaa hi hota he
 Therefore, it is clear that it is very weak acid
 shuddh avasthaa main prusik amla sthaayee padaarth he, jise kaanch ke bartan main kaaphi din tak aparivartit avasthaa main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In the presence of some alkaline substances, such as ammonia or sodium cyanide, the polymerization of the acid begins, respectively, and as a result of this action, a dark substance is obtained which has almost the same chemical organization as prusic acid
 is kriya main paryaapt maatra main ooshmaa nikalati he
 Also, by applying heat, the velocity of the reaction also increases
 at: adhik maatra main is padaarth kaa bahulkikaran hone se taap kii vruddhi ke saath saath visphot ho jane kii bhi kaaphi sambhaavna rahati he
 This acid can be made permanent in the presence of acid or water-producing substances
 is amla ke astor saadhaaran vidhi se nahin banaae ja sakate
 For this, the action of sodium or potassium cyanide on alkyl halide or sulfate is required: iske atirikt alkil cynide, amlon ke amidon ke anadrikaran se bhi banaae ja sakate hai, jisase spasht he ki yah yogic saamaanya cynide mu-kaa naa hai tathaa inako un amlon kaa nitril bhi kehete hai, kyonki inke jayeepghatan se ve amla praapt ho jate hai: Prusic acid reacts with aldehydes or ketones to form additive substances and these compounds have special importance in the synthesis of hydroxy acids
 prusik amla ethilin oxide se ethilin sainahyderin banaata he, jo kuch utprerakon kii upasthiti main asut kiye jane par jal kaa ek anu nikaalkar ek yogic acrilo nitril banaata he
 This compound has special significance in synthesized rubber, fiber and other industries
 at: uparyukt kriya is yogic ke vyapaarik nirmaan main kaam aati he
 The action of prussic acid with chlorine produces cyanogen chloride and similarly cyanogen bromide with bromine, which are of great use
 amlon kii upasthiti main prusik amla jal ke 1 yaa 2 anu lekar farmamide yaa ammonia formet banaata he
 And its water decomposition produces ferric acid
 iske hydrogenikaran yaa apchayan se methil emin banataa he
 In most reactions, cyanide radical behaves like a non-associative non-metallic element
 jis prakaar dhaatuon ke hellide hote hai, usee prakaar dhaatuon ke cynide bhi hote hai
 This similarity is more pronounced in cyanides of alkaline metals, such as sodium or potassium cyanide
 iske atirikt cynojan mulak jatil yogic bhi banaata he, jaise potacium pherocynide, 
 The metals of the eighth class and in the transition metal have great potential to form complex cyanides
 vyavsaayon main prayukt honevaale prusik amla ke lavenon main sodium cynide pramukh he
 In pure state it is obtained by the reaction of castor sodium on ammonia and coal by the method of castor
 ise, prusik amla ko sodium hydroxide vilyan main avashoshit karke bhi banaaya ja saktaa he, par is prakaar praapt sodium cynide kam shuddh hota he
 The salt obtained is soluble in water, alcohol and non ammonia and its melting point is 563
7 ° C
 is
 jaleey vilyan main yah apaghatit ho jaataa he, jiske falswaroop prusik amla tathaa sodium hydroxide praapt hote hai: Sodium decomposition and ammonia are obtained by water decomposition after heating an aqueous solution of sodium cyanide
 isi prakaar potacium cynide bhi praapt ho saktaa he
 Both these salts of prussic acid have special importance in the activities of organic chemistry
 is lavan kaa vyavsaayik mahatv, calcium cynide dwaara ise nirmaan ke kaaran bahut bad gaya he
 In pure state, it is in the form of white powder and it is used a lot as a smoker
 kuch anya dhatvik cynide, jaise kupramacynide, silvercynide tathaa jiksynide anek vyavsaayon tathaa rasinic kriyaaon main kaam aate hai
 Potassium ferrocyanide and potassium ferrocyanide are hybrid salts of prussic acid, which are of great importance in chemical analysis, in the Prussian indigo, in the dyeing industries, and in pigments called iron cyanide indigo
 prusik amla tathaa iske lavan, jaise potacium cynide, bahut vifaille padaarth hai tathaa bahut hi kam maatra main bhi ghaatak siddh hote hai, jo koshikeey oxikaran kriya ke avarodhan ke kaaran hota he
 Symptoms of this toxin are senile, nausea, stuttering, unconsciousness and finally death
 is vish ke praathmik upachaar ke liye rogi ko khuli hawa main litaakar garam rakhana chahie
 If breathing is going on, take a few drops of amyl nitrite in a cloth in the nose for about 30 seconds or smell the ammonia aromatic spirit
 yadi rogi ko kuch hosh ho to use ek prati shat sodium thayosulphate yaa sabun kaa jal mukh dwaara prati 15 minute main dena chahie, jab tak ki vaman na hone lage
 The unconscious patient should not give anything out of the mouth
 yah vish itnaa teevr hota he ki koi virala hi batch paata he or mrityu bahut jald ho jaati he
 The importance of prusic acid for the control of common insects and perishable insects was first known in California in 1886 as a deciduous antidote in orange trees
 godaamon, jahaajon, relon aadi main jahaan saamaan ikattha rahata he, iskaa upyog dhoomak ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Prusic acid is stored in iron cylinders for this purpose
 iske atirikt anya roopon main bhi iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Calcium cyanide is used as a dehydrating antidote, which gives vapor of prussic acid by the moisture of the air
 chuuhe, bijju aadi ke maarane main bhi calcium cynide kaa prayeg karte hai
 Nests of ants, termites etc
 can be destroyed by fumigation by calcium cyanide
 anaaj ke godaamon main dhoomikaran main bhi calcium cynide kaa upyog hota he

 jabaki maratha sena ne anya hindu raajaaon se sahaayta kii ummid kii In this war on January 14, 1761, the Marathas who had reached the starvation had to face defeat after the victory of Suravati
 Historians differ greatly about the losses on both sides in this war
 phir bhi ye mana jaataa he ki is yuddh main 12 xxrep 4 0 logon ne sakriy rup se hissaa liya tha jisamen ahamed shah abdali vijay hui thi or maratha ko baari haani uthaani padi
 In the finance sector, beta is used to demonstrate the sensitivity of an 'expected excess return of an asset' to the 'expected excess return of the market'
 β i = c o v v a r { \ displaystyle \ beta _{i}={ \ frac { \ mathrm {cov} }{ \ mathrm {var} }}} bhi likh sakate hai
 If you want to understand broadly, then you can understand from this example - the beta of a stock will be +1 if that stock goes well with the index of the market
 wo upar jaae to ye bhi upar, wo neeche to ye bhi neeche
 If the beta value of a share is between 0 and +1, it means that the direction of decreasing the share is similar to that of the index but the pace is slower than that of the index
 thik isi prakaar yadi koi share / dibenture, idex se ulta chale to uskaa beta 0 se -1 tak hoga

 Canada is theoretically a monarchy, and its ruler is the head of state of Canada, although the governor-general of Canada exercises all the constitutional powers of the ruler, as his representative
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen " canada kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko " canada ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical background of the monarchy in Canada dates back to British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and established colonies in various corners of the world

 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail

 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but conventionally all these powers are bound to be exercised only by the Maharajyapala, being the representative of the ruler as per the specifications of Parliament and Government
 atah anya rashtramandal prajabhumiyon ke samaan hi, yah ek sansadeey samrajyata he
 As a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions, which are in principle the rights of the ruler, but in reality they are exercised only by the governor-general

 Maharana Pratap had to manage his welcome on the sails of Udaisagar in Udaipur after passing his kingdom within Mewar
 After the reception and mutual interaction, it was time for lunch
 maharaja maansingh bhojan ke liye aaye kintu maharana ko na dekh kar aashcharya main pad gayi
 When he asked Maharana's son Amarsingh for this reason, he told that 'maharana saheb has a headache, so he is unable to support you on food
 ' According to some historians, this incident also became the reason for the battle of Haldi valley
 akbar ko rana pratap ke is vyavhaar ke kaaran mewar par akraman karne kaa ek or mauka mil gaya
 In 1576 AD, he was set on a campaign to punish Maharana Pratapsingh

 Rana Pratap fought that huge Mughal army with a handful of soldiers
 haldi ghati kii pili bhoomi raktranjit ho uthi
 On June 21, 1576 AD, seventeen thousand soldiers were killed in this fierce battle of one day between Pratap and the Mughal army in the Haldi valley near Gogunda
 yaheen rana pratap or maansingh kaa aamanaa-saamana hone par donon ke bich vikat yuddh hua - chetak kii peeth par savaar pratap ne akbar ke senapati maansingh ke hathi ke mastak par kaale-nile rang ke, arabi nasl ke ashv chetak ke paanv jamaa die or apane bhaale se sidhaa raja maansingh par ek pralayankari waar kiya, par tatkaal apane hathi ke majboot haude main chipak kar neeche baith jane se is yuddh main unki jaan batch gayi- houdah pratap ke durgharsh waar se buree tarah mud gaya
 Later, when Rana Pratap went away from the battleground of Haldighati on serious injuries, King Mansingh reached his palace and sent one of Pratap's famous elephant elephant Ramprasad to agra-darbar with other loot
 parantu maansingh ne chittorgarh ke nagar ko luutane kii ajna nahin di thi, yah jaan kar badshaah akbar in par kaaphi kupit hua or kuch vaqt ke liye darbar main inke aane par pratibandh tak laga diya
 In the words of James Todd- "in the days when Akbar was horribly ill and feared to die, Mansingh Khusro had laid a web of conspiracies to place him on the Mughal throne
 

uski yah cheshtaa darbar main sab ko gyaat ho gayi or vah bengal kaa shaasha bana kar bhej diya gaya
 After he left Khusro was imprisoned and kept in prison

 He secretly supported Khusro

 " akbar shashan main jab raja bhagwantdas punjab ke soobedaar niyat hue, tab sindh ke paar seemaant praant kaa shashan unke kunwar maansingh ko diya gaya
 When Akbar's half-brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim died in his 30th year, Mansingh swiftly arrived in Kabul and got the residents there to get rid of the looting that followed the demise of the ruler and his sons Mirza Afrasiyab and Mirza Kankuvad of the kingdom
 He came to the court with other warlords
 akbar ne sindh nadi par kuch din thahar kar kunwar maansingh ko kabul kaa shashankarta niyukt kiya

 dhaularai ke baad amer, jo ek maamuli rajya samajha jaataa tha, maansingh ke samay vahi ek shaktishaalee or vistrut rajya ho gaya tha
 In the history of India, the Kachhwahs were not considered as knights, but during the time of King Bhagwan Das and Mansingh, the Kachwaha people showed their strength, might and glory from Khutan to the sea
 maansingh yon akbar kii adheenta main zarur tha, par uske saath kaam karne vaali rajput sena, badshaah kii sena se kahin adhik shaktishaalee samajhi jaati thi"
 Some other historians do not agree with this about Colonel James Tod
 His statement is that Mansingh was not the adopted son of Bhagwan Das, but he was the son of Bhagwant Das
 bhagavaandas or bhagwant das donon bhai the
 Mughal-history books reveal that on the orders of Akbar, his experienced officers Maharaja Mansingh, local subedar Qutubuddin Khan and Raja Bhagwant Das of Amer made a lot of research to capture Maharana Pratap in the forests of Gogunda and Mewar but eventually failed Akbar became very angry - even in the year 1577, both of them were 'locked up' diyodhi!

 The main views of Islamic religion are: musalmaan ek hi ishwar ko maanate hai, jise ve allaah kehete hai
 Monotheism is called Tauheed in Arabic, which comes from the word vahid which means one
 islam main ishwar ko maanav kii samaj se pare mana jaataa he
 Muslims have been asked to pray to God instead of imagining him
 musalamaanon ke anusaar ishwar adwitiya he - uske jaisaa or koi nahin
 a unique concept of God has been emphasized in Islam and it is also believed that it is beyond human to describe it completely
 kaho: No one has given birth to him nor is he the father of anyone
 evam us jaisaa koi or nahin he
 " islam ke anusaar ishwar ne dharti par manushya ke maargdarshan ke liye samay samay par kisi vyakti ko apana doot banaaya

 The prophets to whom God himself provided scriptures or religious books are called Rasul
 mohammad sahab bhi isi kadi kaa bhaag the
 The name of the religious book that was given to him is Quran
 quran main allaah ke 25 anya nabiyon kaa varnan he
 According to the Quran itself, God has sent many more prophets to the earth besides these prophets, which are not mentioned in the Quran
 sabhi musalmaan ishwar dwaara bheje gayi sabhi nabiyon kii vaidhata sweekaar karte hai or musalmaan, mohammad ko ishwar kaa antim nabi maanate hai
 The Ahmadiyya community does not consider Muhammad Sahab the last prophet, yet calls himself a follower of Islam and is accepted by the United Nations, although it is prohibited in many Islamic nations to consider him a Muslim

 islam ke do pramukh varg hai, shiya or sunni
 Both have their own Islamic rules but the basic principles are similar
 bahut se sunni, shiyaon ko purnat: musalmaan nahin maanate
 Sunni Islam, also known as the 5 pillars of Islam
 shiya islam main thode alag siddhanton ko stambh kaha jaataa he
 There are 5 pillars of Sunni Islam- arabi:لا اله الا الله محمد رسول اللهlipyaantar : laa elaha illallaah mohammad rasul allaah hindi: allaah ke sivaa or koi parameshwar nahin he or mohammad allaah ke rasul hai
 With this declaration, every Muslim testifies to the monotheism of God and his belief in Muhammad as Rasul
 yah islam kaa sabase pramukh siddhant he
 It is mandatory for every Muslim to accept it musalamaanon ke liye islam jivan ke har pahalu par apana prabhaav rakhata he
 Islamic principles influence the domestic life of Muslims, their political or economic life, the foreign policy of Muslim states, etc
 sharia us samucchy niti ko kehete hai jo islamic kanoonee paramparaon or islamic vyaktigat or naitik aacharnon par aadhaarit hoti he
 The study of jurisprudence is called Fiqh by making the policy of Sharia the foundation

 This journey is called Hijra and it is from here that the Islamic calendar begins
 madina ke logon kii zindagi aapasi ladaayeeyon se pareshaan si thi or hazrat mohammad sahab ke sandeshon ne unhen vahaan bahut lokapriy bana diya
 In 630, Hazrat Muhammad sahab invaded Mecca due to a breach of a treaty with his followers

 The Kaaba located in Mecca was declared a holy place of Islam
 632 main paigambar mohammad sahab kaa dehanth ho gaya
 But until his death, all Arab tribes had become part of a political and social civilization under the influence of Islam
 is ke baad islam main khilaafat kaa daur shuru hua
 Muhammad's father-in-law Abu Bakr Siddiq was the first caliph of the Muslims in 632
 kai pramukh musalamaanon ne mil ke unka khalipha hona sweekaar kiya
 According to Sunni Muslims, there was no dispute regarding the struggle against Abu Bakr Siddiq, but all of them had accepted the Khalifa, according to Sunni beliefs, Hazrat Muhammad Sahab himself tried to impose Abu Bakr Siddiq in his place before his exile
 Abu Bakr Siddiq had indicated to be the Khalifa by taking charge of the work, in 632, Muhammad Sahab in his last Haj i had addressed his teammates near the lake
 shiya vishwaas ke anusaar is kitaab main unhone apane damaad ali ko apana vaaris banaaya tha
 Sunnis consider this incident as praise for Hazrat Ali and believe that he did not appoint Hazrat Ali Khalifa
 isi baat ko lekar dono pakshon main matbhed shuru hota he
 After the Hajj, Muhammad Sahib began to remain ill
 unhone sabhi bade sahaabiyon ko bula kar kaha ki mujhe kalam daavaat de do ki main tumko esa navishta likh don ki tum bhatko nahin to umr ne kaha ki ye hijayaan kah rahe he or nahin dene diya 
 According to Shia history, even when news of Prophet's death was received, he did not come back and started gathering in Sakifa, what should be done now
 jis samay hazarat mohammad kii mrityu hui, ali or unke kuch or mitra mohammad sahab ko dafanaane main lage the, abu baqar madina main jaakar kilaafat ke liye vimarsh kar rahe the
 Many people of Medina agreed to make Abu Bakr a caliph
 dhyaan rahe ki mohammad sahib evam ali ke kabeeley vaale yani bani hashim ali ko hi khalipha bananaa chaahate the
 But there was no solidarity among the Muslims to inherit the largest empire of Islam ever
 kai logon ke anusaar ali, jo mohammad sahab ke chachere bhai the or damaad bhi hi mohammad sahab ke asli vaaris the
 But Abu Bakr was first made Khalifa and after his death Umar was made Khalifa
 isse ali ke samarthak logon main or bhi rosh failaa parantu ali musalamaanon kii bhalaai ke liye chup rahe
 But according to the Shia Muslim, Muhammad's uncle Jad brother, Ali, whom Muslims respected so much, refused to consider Abu Bakr as a caliph

 During his tenure, the Islamic empire spread very rapidly and the entire Iranian Empire and two-thirds of the Eastern Roman Empire were captured by Muslims
 puure samrajya ko vibhinn pradeshon main baat diya gaya or or har pradesh kaa ek rajyapal niyukt kar diya gaya jo kii khalipha kaa adheen hota tha
 Usman bin Affan became the Khalifa in 644, after Umar bin Khatab
 yah bhi mohammad ke pramukh saathiyon main se the
 His opponents began to accuse Usman bin Afan that he made appointments out of favor and that Ali was rightfully entitled to be the Khalifa
 tabhi misr main vidroh kii bhaavana jaagane lagi or vahaan se 1000 logon kaa ek sashastr samooh islamic samrajya kii rajdhani madina aa gaya
 Till that time, all the Khalifa lived like ordinary people
 is liye yah samooh 656 main usmaan kii hatya karne main safal ho gaya
 Some prominent Muslims now accepted Ali as the Khalifa, but some leading Muslims also turned against Ali
 in musalamaanon kaa maananaa tha kii jabatak usmaan ke hatyaron ko sazaa nahin milti ali kaa khalipha bananaa sahi nahin he
 This was the first civil war of Islam
 shuru main is dal ke ek hisse kii aguai aaysha, jo kii mohammad kii patni thi, kar rahi thim
 Between the armies of Ali and Aashya, there is a battle called jung-e-jamal

 muavia kii senaain ab puure islamic samrajya main fail gayin or jald hi kufa ke pradesh ke sivaaye saare samrajya par muavia kaa kabja ho gaya
 Then a radical killed Ali in 661
 ali ke baad haalanki muavia khalipha ban gayi lekin musalamaanon kaa ek varg rah gaya jiskaa maananaa tha ki musalamaanon kaa khalipha mohammad ke parivaar kaa hi ho saktaa he
 He believed that this caliph gets spiritual guidance by God himself
 inke anusaar ali pehle imaam the
 This class became known as Shia class
 baaki musalmaan, jo kii yah nahin maanate hai ki mohammad kaa parivarajan hi khalipha ho saktaa he, sunni kahalaaye
 The Sunni first called the Rashidun Khalifa, which means the Khalifa on the right path

 kaimur, bihar kaa ek prakhand
 Parivar is a Hindi language film made in 1968
 hindi kahani hindi sahitya kii pramukh kathatmak vidha he

 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has considered 'indumati' written by Kishori Lal Goswami as the first Hindi story
 iske sambandh main saamanyat: do aapattiyaan uthaai gai hai – ek yah ki ho na ho yah kisi bangala kahani kaa anuwaad ho auki duusari yah ki is par tempest kii chaaya he
 From the point of view of the period, Acharya Shukla's written 'eleven years' time is another story
 par inke pehle bhi kahaniyaan likhi gai thim
 Coincidentally, no one noticed them
 70 ke dashak main 'sarika' main hindi kii pehali kahani ke sambandh main tippaniyan-lekh prakashit hue
 Shri Varma has tried to prove Madhvaprasad Sapre's 'basket of soil' as the first Hindi story
 kishorilaal goswami kii hi likhi kahani 'pranayani' parinay hindi kii pehali moulik kahani he
 It was written in the year 1897
 isame do premiyon kii kahani kahi gai he
 The lover was undertaking to enter the girlfriend's house that the king was caught as a thief
 kintu unke pragadh prem kaa parichay paakar raja ne donon kaa vivaah kara diya
 This has the effect of Kathasaritsagar
 style puraani he, samaapan bhi bharat vaakya se hota he
 But if the story will be identified on the basis of the narrative style and the same central feeling, then it will definitely be the first original story of Hindi
 vastut: san 1900 i se 1915 i tak hindi kahani ke vikaas kaa pehla daur tha
 Spontaneity of mind 1907 AD, Gulbahar 1902 AD, Pandit and Panditani 1903 AD, eleven years time 1903 AD, Dulaiwali 1907 AD, Vidya Bahar 1909 AD, Rakhiband Bhai 1909 AD, village 1911 AD, happy life 1911 AD, Rasiya Balam 1912 AD, Pardesi 1912 AD, Kangana in the ears 1913 AD, Rakshabandhan 1913 AD, he said that the publication of 1915 AD, etc
 proves that the development of Hindi stories in this early period All the signs are found
 1950 tak hindi kahani kaa ek vistrut daur samaapt ho jaataa he or hindi kahani paripakvata ke daur main pravesh karti he
 In 1916 AD, the first story of Premchand was published
 premchand ke aagaman se hindi kaa katha-sahitya samaaj-saapeksh satya kii ore muda
 Premchand's last story 'kafan' was published in 1936, and he died in the same year
 bees varshon kii is avadhi main kahani kii kai pravritiyaan ubhar kar aain
 But if we do not see these trends separately then this whole period can be taken as a duality of ideal and reality
 is kalavadhi main 'prasad' or premchand kahaniyon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Prasad is primarily a romantic storyteller
 kintu unke antim kahani sangrah 'indrajaal' main sangrahit indrajaal, gunda, saleem, viramchinh se unki yathaarthonmukhi pravriti ko pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 But being romantic, he was idealistic
 premchand ne apane ko aadarshonmukhi yathartwaadee kaha he
 In fact, he was also an idealist
 kintu apane vikaas ke antim kaal main ve yatharth kii katutaa ko bhogakar yathartwaadee ho gaye
 'pus Ki Raat' and 'kafan' are proof of this
 san '33 main niraala kaa ek sangrah 'lily' prakashit ho chukaa tha
 His stories are very realistic
 prasad kaa romentic adarsh unki praarambhik kahaniyon main bhi dikhaai detaa he
 But in Chandradhar Sharma 'guleri' story 'he had told' it is found in its entire color
 prasad kii mahatvapurn romentic kahaniyaan 'usne kaha tha' ke baad likhi gayi
 'he had said' is romantic in its nature, character-imagining, culmination
 premantnya tyaag, balidaan – yahan tak ki mrityu kaa varan sabhi kuch romentic adarsh kii paripurti karte hai
 The love that arises in an eight-year-old girl and a twelve-year-old boy emerges even after an interval of twenty-five years in such a way that Lahna Singh dies for that romantic love
 is adarsh kii raksha ke liye vaastaviktaa ko nazarandaaz kar diya gaya he
 The technical achievements of this story are unprecedented
 naatakeeyata, sthanik rang, rangeen setting, jeevant varnan, flash back, swapn aadi ko kahani main samavisht karne kaa pehla shrey unheen ko he
 Prasad has acquired certain technical characteristics of Gulerji in his stories, but he is basically lyrical
 prageeton main katha tatva kam, bhav adhik hota he
 He is the representative poet of Shadowism
 ateet ke shauryamulak chitron, prabhaavshaalee prakritik vaataavaranon, premagat antardvandon main unka man adhik rama he
 He has worked most passionately in depicting love and beauty
 ek duusari visheshta, jo praaia: alakshith rah jaati he, yah he ki unhone kahani ke paatro ko vyaktitv diya
 Subjectivity has been characteristic of cinematic poetry
 naatakon ke paatro ko bhi unhone sarvapratham vyaktitv diya
 The same thing can be said in relation to the story
 'gunda' ke babu nanhook singh jaise vyakti charitra kii sristi adwitiyata main akeli he
 Thus Madhulika, Champa, Salvati etc
 are also unforgettable
 rashtriya chetana chhayavaadi kavy ke ek vaishishtay he
 This can be seen in stories like 'awards'
 man kaa gahan antarvavandv to inaki kahani kaa muladhar he
 'akashdeep' is a living example of this
 pragitatmakataa ke sabhi tatva – atyadhik dhanatvpurn vednaa, ekthanta aadi ke liye visaati drashtavy hai
 His stories diverge from Premchand's stories due to a different point of view
 isalio aalochakon ne prasad santhaan kii kahaniyon ko premchand-santhaan kii kahaniyon se pruthak mana he
 Isolation of approach is isolation of structure
 unke kathanak main ghatnaayen kam or sthitiyon ke prati pratikriyaayein adhik hai
 As a result, theatricality has become predominant in them
 unke charitra bhi sthitiyon se guzar kar apane kriya-kalapon dwaara apane vyaktitv ko pratishthit karte hai
 Wherever the natural setting is taken it has become an essential part of the entire story
 chhayavaadi kavy kii tarah us par bhi maanviya chetana kii aarope dikhaai detaa he
 Such a combination of cognition and imagination will not be found elsewhere
 premchand ne kahaniyon ko vyashti-jivan se samshti-jivan kii ore modaa
 Prasad's stories are so close to the shadowy poetry-consciousness that they themselves have become lyrical
 unamem mishrit bhaavon ke dwandv mukhyat: kaavyatmak or vyaktimulak hai, isliye saamaanya jivan kaa pravaah vahaan nahin milegaa
 Premchand made them comfortable by embellishing the rhetoric laden on the stories
 yon premchand kii aarambhik kahaniyon main ek doosraa algaav dikhaai padataa he
 It is commonly called idealism
 par use sudhaarwad kahana chahie
 The elders' daughter's nobility, opposition to child marriage, widow-marriage support comes under reformism
 par kramash: unamem parivartan aayaa or unhone yatharth bhartiya jivan ko aankane kaa puraa prayaas kiya
 No other person tried to portray the middle class society of this country in stories with such variety
 sankhya main bhi unhone kaaphi kahaniyaan likhi hai – do sau choubees
 After writing a few stories, the storytellers often repeat themselves, but Premchand has not repeated himself
 yah unki drushti-vyapti kaa suchak he
 The manner in which he has portrayed the problems of domestic life and the irony of social life is not very complicated but is perfectly capable of exposing the immediate families and institutions
 unki aadarshonmukh or ansankrut katha-style bhartiya katha-aakhyayika ke mail main adhik he
 Later, Premchand realized that his ideals did not flourish in his life
 isaliye kalpanaatmak adarsh kaa pallaa chhodkar ve yatharth jivan kii katutaaon kaa chithran karne lage
 His changed outlook and new structure can be seen in 'pus Ki Raat' and 'kafan'
 in donon kahaniyon ko vishesh rup se antim kahani ko purnat: aadhunik kaha ja saktaa he
 These stories do not hang on to any ideal
 inamen aalochak yah nahin bataa saktaa ki kahani kaa sampreshy koi khaas vastu he
 They are their own objective - from beginning to end
 koi parinti nahin he koi charmotkarsh nahin he
 There is only semiotics, readers are allowed to fly the concept
 aaj kii aalochana main jis bhashik sarjana kii charchaa kii jaati he use inamen puri oonchaai par dekha ja saktaa he
 Both stories are beautiful examples of the process of investigation
 aashcharya to yah dekh kar hota he ki aaj kii jindagi main jis vidooshakatv kaa pravesh dekha ja rahaa he uske tevar 'kafan' main maujuud hai
 But he has put this clown in a constructive context that signifies a meaningful value view, stripping the entire society
 ek aitihaasik sangati ke falswaroop kafan main aadhunik jivan kaa akelaapan or dihyoomanizeshan sadrishy main hi samavisht ho gaya he
 This is the story of the first modernization of Hindi
 prasad or premchand santhaan ke jo lekhak hue unamem vikaas kaa koi kram lakshith nahin hota he
 His stories often do not reflect his independent personality
 raikrishnadas prasad-santhaan ke lekhak hai
 Chandiprasad Hridayesh does not have the poeticity of Prasad, only his ornament
 premchand santhaan ke lekhakon main sudarshan, vishwambharnath kowshik, raja radhikaramanprasad singh, bhagwatiprasad vaajapeyi aadi kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In the year 1922, Ugri entered Hindi-fiction
 ugr na to prasad kii tarah romentic the or na hi premchand kii bhanti aadarshonmukh yathartwaadee
 He was only realistic - from nature he exposed the bare reality of society in a strong language-style
 samaaj kii gandagi ko anaavruth karne ke kaaran tathakthith shuddhtavaadi aalochakon ne unki tikhi aalochana kii
 His literature was called Grassletti literature
 unhone saamaajik kurupataaon par tikhaa prahaar kiya
 The fire of fire, chinkariya, rape, eccentric rich, chocolate, rainbow etc
 are his famous stories
 in kahaniyon ko amaryadit or vighatak bataaya gaya he
 But if many of his stories are indefinite, then the same will have to be said in relation to many stories of today's writers
 ugr kii kahaniyon ke liye ek pratimaan tathaa aaj kii waisi hi kahaniyon ke liye doosraa pratimaan nahin lagu kiya ja saktaa
 In today's context Ugre's stories need to be reconsidered
 chaturasen shastri, rishabhcharan jain aadi par ugr kaa prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 In 27–28 CE, Jainndra started writing the story
 unki pehali kahani khel vishaal bharat main prakashit hui thi
 Her story collections are the Rajakanya, one night, two sparrows, Pajeb, Jayasandhi etc
 of the hanging Vayayan Neelam country
 unke aagaman ke saath hi hindi-kahani kaa nayaa utthan shuru hota he
 The meaning of new uplift is not clear by telling psychological stories
 unhen hindi kaa sharadchandra kah kar bhi log bhranti kii sristi karte hai
 Zainendra does not have the sentiment of Sharad Chandra
 jainendra kii kahaniyon main ek vishisht prakaar ke jivan-darshan kii khoj he
 a deep duality of mind is also depicted in Prasad's stories
 par is dwandv ke aayam simit hai
 Zainendra exposes layers of mind and tries to interpret it through it
 kahaniyon ke madhyam se satyanveshan kaa yah prayaas pehali baar jainendra kii kahaniyon main dikhaai padataa he
 Jainendra says - The story is an appetite that constantly tries to find a solution
 hamaare apane sawaal hote hai, shankaaye hoti hai, chintaayen hoti hai or ham unka uttar, unka samaadhaan khojane kaa satat praytn karte rahete hai
 Our experiments continue
 xxrep 4 
 The process of this investigation is related to the trade of Gandhian non-violence and Freudian unconscious mind
 isaliye jagah jagah naitik maanon kaa prashn uthta he
 But there is also a kind of mystery and conceit in Jainndra
 yah unki visheshta or kamajori donon hai
 Later on, where his philosophy has become relaxed and investigative, his attitude is more gross and fickle
 parvarti kahaniyon kii mudraayen isi tarah kii hai
 The structure of their stories begins at the point of the individual
 avchetan man kii kuch gutthiyaan oochaal di jaati hai
 They sometimes clash with any other tendency or external morality of their own
 yah takaraahat atmpida or ahan ke vilgan main parinat hokar kahani ban jaati he
 They often find a lack of logical investigation and they fulfill it with a latent mystery
 aage kuch dinon tak premchand or jainendra kii paramparaon kaa vikaas hi hindi – kahani kaa vikaas mana gaya he
 Yashpal is originally the storyteller of Premchand's tradition
 '36 i main pragatisheel lekhak sangh kii sthapana ho chuki thi
 The inclusion of the element of progress in the writings of the writers of this time should be considered as Yugadharma
 yashpal rashtriya sangram ke ek sakriy krantikari kaaryakarta the
 That is why they considered the means of literature, not feasible
 spasht he ki unki kahaniyaan kisi na kisi uddeshy kii purti ke liye likhi gai hai
 While Premchand was an enemy of wealth, Yashpal was rich
 dhani varg hamaare samaaj ke kodh hai
 At the core of all cultural-moral inconsistencies is the inequality of money
 marks ke saath hi in par frid kaa bhi gaharaa prabhaav he
 As a result, open images of sexual consciousness will also be found in his story novels
 inke darjanon kehani-sangrah prakashit ho chuke hai - pinjade kii udaan, wo duniya, gyandaan, abhishpt, tark kaa tufaan, bhasmaavruth chingaari, phulon kaa kurta, uttami kii maan aadi
 The stories of Yashpal are taken as illustrations
 isliye unki kahaniyaan bahut kuch niojit hoti hai
 The main basis of this planning is imagination - not perception
 premchand kii rachana-prakriya se inaki rachana-prakriya kaaphi milti-julati he
 In Premchand's stories, a static idea comes first and later the characters, situations, events etc
 are explored according to it
 yashpal kii prakriya isse bhinn nahin he
 In Premchand, reformism predominates, Yashpal has Marxism and Freudism
 ve vichaaron ke kahanikar hai, chintan ke nahin
 They are unmatched in deep satire on social characteristics and the hollowness of middle class society
 yashpal kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki katha kaa ras unamem sarvatra miltaa he
 Agnostics are experimental artists
 unke aagaman ke saath kahani nai disha kii ore mudi
 The first prize of modernity which is discussed a lot today remains unknowable - in poetry as well as in fiction
 prayogdharma hone ke saath saath ve apane abhijaateey sanskaron ke kaaran sachet bhi hai
 The Romani rebellion appears in his early stories
 lekin kramash ve romance se hatate gayi
 He repeatedly mentions the omission of ego, it is an attempt to break away from romance
 unki shreshth kahaniyon main unke ahan ne dakhal nahin diya he
 Therefore, she has become unique in her synthesis
 vipagaatha, parampara, kothri kii baat, sharnaarthi, jaydol or ye tere praturup unke kahani sangrah hai
 The stories in both earlier collections feature Ego Blast and Romani Rebellion
 sharnaarthi kii kahaniyaan bauddhik sahanubhuti se prerit hone ke kaaran rachanaatmak nahin ban padi hai
 But the stories in the Jaidol collection hold their own
 is sangrah kii adhikansh kahaniyon main ahan purnat visarjeet he
 Out of his sight, there has been completeness in his vision and synthesis in composition
 udaahranarth unki do kahaniyon ko dekha ja saktaa he
