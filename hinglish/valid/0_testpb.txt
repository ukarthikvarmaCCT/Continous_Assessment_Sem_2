 Karma is the concept of Hinduism that interprets the principle of work-cause through a system where the beneficial effect of past beneficial actions and the malefic effects of malefic actions is achieved, creating a cycle of rebirth of the soul
 Creates a system of revival or rebirth actions and reactions in life
 kaha jaataa he ki kaary-kaaran siddhant na keval bhautik duniya main lagu hota he, balki hamaare vichaaron, shabdon, kaaryon or un kaaryon par bhi lagu hota he jo hamaare nirdeshon par duusare kiya karte hai
 When the cycle of rebirth ends, the person is said to have attained salvation, or liberation from the world
 sabhi punarjanm maanav yoni main hi nahin hote hai
 It is said that the cycle of birth and death on earth goes on in 84 lakh yoni, but only in human vagina it is possible to get out of this cycle
 kiye gaye krityon ke nirnaayak pratifal ke sandarbh main aatma ke dehantaran yaa punarjanm kaa siddhant rugaved main nahin miltaa he
 The concept of karma first appeared in strong words in the Bhagavad Gita
 puraanon main karm ke vishay kaa ullekh he
 It is said that Puranas were written by Saint Vyasa at the end of Dwapara Yuga to preserve knowledge during Kali Yuga
 kaha jaataa he ki pehle vahi gyaan bhikshuon dwaara yaad rakhaa jaataa tha or maukhik rup se dusron ko diya jaataa tha
 According to Mr
 Yukteswar, the last Kali Yuga BC
 Started in 700
 "karm" kaa shabdic arth he "kaam" yaa "kriya" or bhi mote taur par yah nimitt or parinaam tathaa kriya or pratikriya kehalaata he, jiske bare main hinduon kaa maananaa he yah sabhi chetana ko niyantrit karata he
 Karma is not destiny, a man should be able to work freely and this will create his destiny
 According to the Vedas, if we sow good, we will reap good, if we sow evil, we will reap evil
 Our work done in its entirety and the reactions associated with it and the past birth are related to karma, all these determine our future
 karm kii vijay bauddhik kaary or sanyamit pratikriya main nihit he
 Not all actions turn back immediately
 kuch jamaa hote hai or is janm yaa anya janm main apratyaashit rup se laut kar aate hai
 We act in four ways: vah sab kuch jo hamane kabhi sochaa, kaha, kiya yaa kaaran bana; thik vaisaa hi hota hai jaisaa ki ham us samay sochate hai, bolte hai, karte hai; yahi karm hai
 Hindu scriptures divide karma into three types: sachet hokar kiye gaye kaary kahin adhik gambhir hote hai, bajaae bina soche-samajhe kiye gaye kaary ke
 thik usee tarah jis tarah anjaane main kha liya gaya jehar hamen prabhavit karata he, dhokhe se diya gaya jehar bhi upyukt carmik prabhaav hi degaa
 Only a human being can distinguish karma from right to wrong
 pashu or chote bachche nae karm kii rachana nahin karte hai kyonki ve sahi or galat kaa antar karne main aksham hote hai
 However, all sentient beings can understand the effects of karma, which is experienced in pleasure and suffering
 ek hindu sant tulsidas ne kaha, "hamaare sharir ke astitv main aane se bahut pehle hi hamaari niyati aakaar grahan kar leti he
"sanchit karm kaa bhandar jab tak chalata rahata he, tab tak praarabdh karm ke rup main iske ek bhaag ke sukh kaa ek jivan main liya janaa jari rahata he, jo janm evam mrityu ke chakra kii ore le jaataa he
 An organism cannot attain salvation from the cycle of birth and death until the accumulated accumulated karma is completely eliminated
 prithvi par janm or mrityu kaa chakra 84 lakh yoniyon main chalata he or unamem se sirf ek manushya yoni he
 Only as human beings, we are in a position to do something about our destiny by doing the right thing at the right time
 sakaaratmak karmon, shuddh vichaaron, prarthana, mantra or dhyaan ke madhyam se, ham vartmaan jivan main karm ke prabhaav ko sulajhane or bhagya ko behatar banane ke liye use badal sakate hai
 Only a spiritual master who knows the sequence in which our karma will bear fruit can help us
 manushya ke rup main achche karm ke abhyaas ke dwaara hamaare paas hamaari aadhyatmik pragati kii gati ko twarit karne ke avasar hai
 Our lack of knowledge and clarity leads to negative karma
 dayaaheenata kharaab fal paidaa karti he, jise paap kehete hai or achche karm se mithe falon kii prapti hoti he, jise punya kehete hai
 What one does, it becomes what one does: a person becomes holy by performing holy deeds and evil by doing bad deeds
 karm ke parinaam yaa uske abhaav ko niyantrit karne main divine shakti kii bhoomika ke bare main hindu dharm main kai bhinn prakaar ke darshan hai, kuch kaa swaroop aaj bhi vartmaan he or kuch aitihaasik hai
 Followers of Vedanta, the dominant religion of Hinduism, still exist today, who believe that God, the divine, is playing his role
 vedant darshan ke anusaar, paramatma moolbhoot rup se karm ko lagu karanevaala he, kintu achche yaa bure ko chunane ke liye manushya swatantra hota he
 In these theistic schools, karma is not seen merely as a law of cause and effect, for example as Buddhism or Jainism endorses this idea, but is dependent on the will of the divine
 shaiva mat main shiv yaa vaishnav mat main vishnu nijee parameshwar ke udaahranon kaa rup main shaamil hai
 a summary of the theistic view of karma is expressed by the following: "god does not make anyone miserable for no reason, nor does anyone please anyone without reason
 God is very just and truly gives you what you deserve
 
 " Thus, theistic groups of theism emphasize that karma is an explanation for the problem of human suffering; a soul is reborn in a suitable body, which is dependent on karma and it is said to explain why some people did not get the fruits of their karma during their lifetime and why some children die without committing any sin
 It goes
 is prakaar, ek vyakti ko apane vyaktigat karm kaa fal miltaa he or use paudhon, pashuon se maanav main kai janmon se guzarana pad saktaa he or karm ke aise fal kaa saadrishy kisi ek bank main jamaa hota he taaki bank khate ko chuktaa kiye bina kisi vyakti ko karm ke prabhaav se mukt nahin kiya jaay
 In some early historical traditions of Hinduism, followers of an atheistic section of the Samkhya sect do not accept the idea of supreme divine power
 According to the Sankhya philosophy, no divine being exists, but less highly developed beings help to deliver the fruits of karma; thus, they believe that some kind of role is played by gods or spirits
 ye astitv loukik sansar main sukh pahunchane main sahaayta kar sakate hai or janm va mrityu ke baad, tathaa moksh main bhi ye madad kar sakate hai
 Early historical traditions of Hinduism, such as the Mimamsa, reject the view of any such divinity and view karma as independently functioning, believing that the natural laws of causal-action relations are sufficient to explain the effects of karma
 unke vichaaron ke anusaar, na to sarvocch bhagwaan hota he or na hi usase kuch kam daivatv kaa astitv; sanskaar hi keval karm ke fal utpann karata he; is prakaar, ve vishwaas karte hai ki karm khud hi parinaam utpann karte hai or koi paramatma yaa ishwar yaa jaraa kam yaa laghu daivatv parinaamon ko nahin vitarit karata
 These divergent views are explicitly mentioned in several series in the Brahma Sutra, an important treatise of Vedanta, the larger sect of Hinduism, where the concept of God is endorsed, that is, a personal supreme God was considered the source of the fruits of karma
 Is, but to counter them the comment contradicts the idea
 udhaaharan ke liye, brahma sutara kii kadi III
2
38 par swami shivanand kii tippanee karm ke fal vitarak ke rup main ishwar kii bhoomika kaa ullekh karti he
 Swami Vireshwarananda's comment on the same episode states that the purpose of this episode is specifically to refute the views of Mimamsa, which states that karma, rather than God, bears fruit for a person's actions
 mimasawadiyon ke anusaar is uddeshy ke liye ek ishwar ko pratishthit karnaa bekaar he, kyonki karm khud hi bhavishya main parinaam de saktaa he
 Some interpretations of the Bhagavad-gītā hold an intermediate view, that karma is the law of cause and effect, yet God can lighten karma for his devotees
 haalanki, bhagavad gita kii kadiyon kii anya vyakhyaaon main bhagwaan ko akele karm kaa antim kriyaatmak niyantaa bataaya gaya he
 Another idea is that a Sadguru working for God can reduce or endow the work of his follower
 vedant jaise hindu dharm ke aastik sampradaay buddha vichaar, jain or anya hindu vichaaron se asahmat hai ki karm mahaj kaaran va prabhaav kaa ek niyam he, bajaay iske unka vichaar he ki ek nijee sarvocch ishvar kii ichha dwaara karm kii madhyasthata kii jaati he
 Adi Shankar, an Indian philosopher who consolidates the Advaita Vedanta doctrine, a branch of the Vedanta Sampradaya, states in a commentary in the Vedantic scripture Brahma Sutra that the basic actions of karma itself cannot bring about proper results in any future; Nor is the unseen - an invisible power whose non-physical contact between work and its outcome - that mediates the appropriate by itself, which is judiciously worthy of happiness and sorrow
 unke anusaar, tab falon ko prabandhit karne kaa kaam nishchit hi ek sachet pratinidhi ke jariye hona chahie, jiskaa naam he ek sarvocch astitv 
 The actions of human karma result in merits and demerits
 chunki koi achaitanya vastu chal nahin sakati, use chalaane ke liye ek madhyam kii jarurat padati he or chunki karm kaa niyam ek gaiyr-budhimaan or achaitanya niyam he, isiilie shankar kaa tark he ki aise main ek sachet bhagwaan hona hi chahie jo vyaktiyon ke apane kiye gayi kaaryon ke gun or dosha ke bare main jaanata he or vyaktiyon ko upyukt fal dilaane main jo sahaayak ke rup main kaam karata he
 Thus, God affects the environment of a person, even its atoms and for those souls who are incarnated, produces a suitable rebirth body and all in order that the person can have a suitable experience of karma
 
 is prakaar, karm ke liye aastikta-sambandhi ek prashaasak yaa paryvekshak hona hi chahie, arthath, bhagwaan hona hi chahie
 In his commentary on the synthesis of Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras, the same revival is found in the views of Swami Sivananda, an Advaita scholar
 brahm sutara ke adhyay 3 par apni tippanee main shivanand ne ullekh kiya ki karm jad or kshanbhangur hota he or kisi kaam ke nishpadit ho jane ke baad uskaa astitv samaapt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, karma can never provide the fruits of work in future according to one's ability
 Furthermore, one cannot say that karma produces apurva or virtue, which bears fruit
 chunki apurv achaitanya he, isiilie yah kuch kar nahin saktaa jab tak ki kisi budhimaan praani kaa astitv, jaise ki bhagwaan dwaara chalaaya na jaay
 yah swatantra rup se inaam yaa sajaa pradaan nahin kar saktaa he
 This concept is explained in a part of Swami Sivananda's translation of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad: unki tippanee ke anusaar, pehla pakshi vyakti vishesh kii aatma kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jabaki doosraa brahman yaa bhagwaan kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The soul is basically a reflection of Brahman
 ped sharir kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The soul establishes itself with the body, receives the fruits of its actions and undergoes rebirth
 bhagwaan akele ek shaashvat gavaah ke rup main sthir rahata he, sadaiv trupt or bhojan nahin karata, lekin vah khaanevaale or khaae gayi donon kaa hi sanchaalak hota he
 Swami Sivananda also mentions that God is free from accusations of partiality and cruelty, although he is charged with social inequality, destiny and universal suffering in the world
 brahm sutara ke anusaar, vyaktigat aatma apane bhagya ke liye jimmedaar hai; bhagwaan mahaj vitarak he or sandarbh ke saath aatma ke gun va dosha kaa gavaah he
 In his commentary on chapter 2 of the Brahma Sutra, Sivananda further states that the position of God in relation to karma can be explained through the analogy of rain
 haalanki chaaval, jau or anya anaaj ke vikaas main barish ko sahaayak kaha ja saktaa he, lekin vibhin prajatiyon main bhinnata unke bijon main chhipi antajshakti kii vividhta ke kaaran hua karti he
 Thus, Sivananda states that there are differences between classes of beings due to different qualities and demerits of different souls
 unhone nishkarsh nikaala he ki praaniyon kii vishesh kriyaaon par vichaar karke hi bhagwaan puraskaar yaa dand kii seemaa tay karata he
 The description of Karma is discussed in other Vedanta views in the section on Vaishnavism
 shaiva siddhant sampradaay ke thirugnana sambanthar ne i
san
7veen shatabdi main shaivavaad kii ruparekha main karm ke bare main likhaa he
 He has explained the concept of karma in Hinduism, separating it from Buddhism and Jainism, which do not require any external existence like God
 unke vishwaas ke anusaar, jis tarah doodh pine ke samay bachhda gaayon ke jhund main apni maa ko khoj saktaa he, usee tarah judane or upyog karne kii jarurat hone par karm vyakti vishesh ko dhund letaa he
 However, theistic Hindus believe that karma, unlike the calf, is a mindless existence
 isliye, karm apane-aap hi upyukt vyakti ko nahin dhund saktaa
 sambanthar kaa nishkarsh he ki karm ko upyukt vyakti ke saath jodne ke liye purna gyaan or shakti ke saath ek budhimaan sarvocch astitv aavashyak he
 In this sense, God is the divine accountant
 ek shaiva dharamshastri or shiv advait ke samarthak appay dikshit kehete hai ki keval shiv hi karm ke niyam ke anusaar sukh or dukh kaa vitaran kar sakate hai
 In this way a person performs good or bad deeds done in the previous births according to their wishes and according to those deeds, a new birth takes place to fulfill the law of karma
 shaivon kaa maananaa he ki janmon ke chakra hua karte hai, jiname aatma karm ke anuroop nishchit shariron kii ore aakrisht hoti rahati he, jo ek naasamajh vastu he or jo keval shiv kii ichha par nirbhar he
 Thus, many people interpret the caste system in accordance with karma, that is, those who did good deeds were born into a very spiritual family
 ek or shaiva dharamshastri tathaa shiv advait ke samarthak shrikanth kaa maananaa he ki alag-alag atmaaen khud hi aise kaam kiya karti hai jinhen unke vishesh kaary karne yaa vishesh kaary se parhez karne ke kaaran ke rup main mana ja saktaa he, jo unke purv main kiye gayi kaaryon kii safalataa ke anuroop hota he
 Shrikanth also believes that Shiva helps someone only when he wishes to do something in a particular way or to abstain from a particular task
 karm apane prabhaav sidhe utpann karata he, is vichaar ke bare main shrikanth kaa maananaa he ki bina kisi buddhi ke karm ke astitv se anek janmon or anek shariron ke madhyam se bahut saare prabhaavon ke paidaa hone kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati; bajaay iske karm ke fal bhagwaan kii ichha se hi mil sakate hai jo manushya kii ichha ke saath saamanjasy bithakar iskaa sanchaalan karata he, yaa phir manushya ke apane karm dwaara baad ke charnon main nirdhaarit hota he taaki sabhi karm bhagwaan shiv kii krupa se uchit kram main vitarit hon
 is tarah, hamaare karmon ke liye ek taraf bhagwaan moolbhoot rup se jimmedaar he or swatantra ichha ke jariye vyakt yaa bhagwaan dwaara hamaare kaaryon ke nirdhaaran ke rup main manushya kii naitik jimmedaari par kisi purvaagrah ke bina, duusari ore hamaare karmon ke anuroop kushi or dukh ke liye bhi bhagwaan jimmedaar he
 a good summary of his view is that "man is responsible, he is free to act according to his will, while Shiva fulfills needs according to the deeds of the soul
" "apane karm ke anusaar " sabhi jivit satta puure brahmad kaa chakkar lagaati rahati hai

" The 32nd name Bhavna, the 44th name Vidhata, the 325th name Apramahatha, the 387th name placeadah, and the 609th name Sribhavana Vishnu's other names that point to this nature of God

 brahm sutara "falmaatah upaapatteh" kahata he ki jeevon ke sabhi kaaryon ke fal ke pradaata ke rup main bhagwaan kaa kaary he
 Other sub-sects of Vedanta, Ramanuja of the Vichitadvaita doctrine, blamed the accumulation of evil karma on all evil things in life for all the bad things in life and upholding that God is the Amla, or the evil stains
 Is without vaishnav dharm sambandhi drushti se brahm sutara kii ramanuj kii vyakhya, ke rup main samaj jaaegi, shri bhashya main, ve brahman ko vishnu ke rup main dekhte hai, jo alag-alag atmaaon ke vibhinn karmon ke samanurupata main vividhta ko krambaddh karata he
 Ramanuja in Sribhasya 1
1
1 reiterates that there are inequalities and variations in the world due to the fruits of the deeds of different souls and that the omnipresent energy of the soul is attained by sorrow or happiness due to its deeds
 karm ke falon ke bich bhinnata, arthath achche yaa bure karm, sarvocch lagu karne vaale ke rup main vishnu ke kaaran hai, phir bhi atmaaen hi apane karmon ke liye swatantra va jimmevaar hoti hai
 Furthermore, Ramanuja believes that Vishnu is kind to people who are fully committed to working to make them happy, they instill a tendency to act very virtuous in such people, such means So that they can be obtained; On the other hand, in order to punish those who make them unhappy, they create such misgivings in their minds that are hindering the path to attain God
 vedant ke anya up-sampradaay, dwait ke sansthaapak madhwacharya kaa duusari ore maananaa he ki yahaan tak ki yadi karm kaa koi aarambh nahin hone or buraai kii samasya kaa kaaran hone ko sweekaar kar bhi liya jaay to bhi karm main vibhinnataaon kaa ek mul kaaran hona hi chahie
 Since there are different kinds of karma of the living beings, from good to bad, from the beginning of time, they should not all begin with one type of karma
 is prakaar, madhwacharya kaa nishkarsh he ki jeev bhagwaan kii rachana nahin hai jaisaa ki isai siddhant kahata he, balki iske bajaay vishnu ke saath praani sah-astitvvaan hai, haalanki unke purna niyantran ke antargat
 is prakaar apni mul prakruti main or jinase ve gujri hon aise apane sabhi dehantaranon main atmaaen un par nirbhar hai
 According to Madhvacharya, God, though he has control, does not interfere with man's free will; Although he is omnipotent, this does not mean that he engages in extraordinary feats
 balki, bhagwaan niyam-kaanoon ke shashan ko lagu karata he, jeevon kii ichchhaaon ke anuroop, unhen apni prakruti kaa anusaran karne kii swatantraaa detaa he
 Thus, God acts as an approver or as a divine accountant and accordingly creatures are free to work according to their innate nature and their accumulated deeds, good and bad
 chunki bhagwaan ek anumodak ke rup main kaary karata he, so sab kuch ke liye param shakti bhagwaan kii ore se aati he or jeev us shakti kaa keval istemaal karata he, apni sahaj prakruti ke anusaar
 haalanki, jaisaa ki upar ullekh kiya gaya he brahm sutara kii shankaraki vyakhya kii tarah madhav is par sahamat hai ki unke dwaara kiye gayi achche or bure karmon ke anuroop jeevon ko puraskaar or dand bhagwaan dwaara pradaan kiya jaataa he or vah apni ichha se nyaay par khud ko drudh rakhte hue aisa karata he or manushya ke karmon dwaara uske kaaryon ko niyantrit nahin kiya ja saktaa or na hi us par pakshpaat yaa kisiike saath krurta kaa aarope lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Swami Tapasyananda explains the principle with equivalence: In a factory, energy comes from the energy plant, but the various rotation cycles move in the same direction as they have been dictated
 is prakaar unka nishkarsh he ki bhagwaan par pakshpaat or krurta ke aarope nahin lagaaye ja sakate
 jeev apane karmon kaa karta or uske falon kaa upabhokta bhi he
 Madhava notably disagrees with traditional Hindu beliefs because of his concept of eternal hell
 udhaaharan ke liye, ve aatma ko teen shreniyon main vibhakt karte hai: kaksha teen main vibhajit atmaaon: ek shrenee kii atmaaen ve hai jo mukti ke liye arhata praapt hai, anya shrenee kii atmaaen nirantar punarjanm yaa nity dehantaran ke yogya hai or teesri shrenee kii atmaaen antat shaashvat narak yaa andhatam kii apradhi hoti hai
 No other Hindu philosopher or sect of Hinduism holds such a belief
 iske vipareet, adhikansh hinduon ko saarvbhaumik moksh main vishwaas he: ki sabhi atmaaon ko antat moksh praapt hoga, bhale hi aisa lakhon punarjanm ke baad hi kyon na ho
 The Swaminarayan sect, which has many followers in the Indian state of Gujarat, its spiritual master Swaminarayan has said that one should not be confused with karma as the giver of the fruits of our actions
 swaminarayan dharm ke ek moolbhoot shaastra vachanamrita main, swaminarayan kehete hai, "jis tarah barish ke jal ke sampark main aane ke baad jameen main ropa gaya beej upar kii ore ankurit hota he, usee tarah, rachana ke dauraan, apane kaaran sharir ke saath jeev maaya ke andar vaas karata he, apane alag-alag karmon ke anusaar karm ke fal ke pradaata bhagwaan kii ichha se unhen vibhinn prakaar ke sharir praapt hote hai
" Thus, like other sects of Hinduism, followers of Swaminarayan sect believe that God is the giver of the fruits of our actions
 haalanki jab vah bure karm ke fal diya karata he, tab log soch sakate hai ki bhagwaan krur he, jabaki baat aisi nahin he
 Actually, God is fair to all
 veda vyas kaa brahm sutara kahata he, "bhagwaan kisi ko sukh or dukh dene main pakshpaati nahin he, balki vah vyakti ke karm ke fal pradaan karata he
" haalanki, hindu dharm ke saamaanya sampradaayon ke vipareet, swaminarayan ke anuyaayi swaminarayan ko sarvocch bhagwaan ke rup main maanate hai, jo hindu dharm ke anuyaayiyon dwaara nahin mana jaataa he
 Jagatguru Kripaluji Maharaj, a swami, states that karma is generally fixed and man receives the fruits of his actions; He has said that even God cannot violate the law of karma; Swami mentions two main examples: The Pandavas suffered a lot while they were supreme devotees of Lord Krishna; Vishnu himself incarnated as the son of Dasharatha and Kaushalya, yet Kaushalya had to be widowed by the death of Dasaratha, yet he did not intervene to end their grief
 haalanki, jagatguru krupaluji maharaj ne yah bhi kaha ki vyakti ke karm ke parinaam kai karkon par nirbhar hai: 1) praarabdh karm, yaa nishchit karm jinka is jivan main anubhav kiya jaataa he; 2) kriyaman karm, jo karm is jivan main kiye ja sakate hai, 3) bhagwaan kii ichha; 4) kisi vishesh sthiti main upasthit anya vyakti ke karm; or 5) sanyog 
 lekin unka yah bhi kahana he ki karm main kai vasteen srijan ke rahasy hai or manushya ko yah prashn bhagwaan par chhod dena chahie jab tak ki use bhagwaan kii prapti nahin ho jaati
 Kulasekhar Alwar, a Vaishnava devotee, says in his "mukundamala Stotra": 'yad yad Bhavishyam Bhavatu Bhagwan poorva-karma-anupam' And pre-karma or Bhagya or Daiva is unseen by us and only God knows as the Creator
 bhagwaan ne karm ke niyam banaaye hai or bhagwaan iskaa ulanghan nahin karenge
 However, God gives courage and strength when sought
 bhagwat puraana kii 10veen pustak ke adhyay 1 main vasudev kansa ko apni patni or krishna kii maa devaki kii htya na karne kaa upadesh dete hai, yah kehete hue ki jinhone janm liya he unke liye mrityu nishchit he or jab sharir panch tatwon main villin ho jaataa he, tab aatma sharir chhodkar asahaay hokar karm ke niyam ke anuroop anya rup dhaaran karti he, unhone brihadaaranyak upanishad, IV:4:3 ke uddhran kaa ullekh kiya
 Further, they further state that whatever is remembered in the person's state of mind at the time of death, the soul takes physical form in a suitable body; That is, at the time of death the sensory body of the soul and its mind, intelligence and ego is projected into the womb of an organism, whether it is human or non-human, which is most suitable for the prime state of mind at the time of death of a particular person
 Can provide the whole body; It is to be noted that this quote is similar to the meaning of Bhagavad Gita, VIII, episode 6
 is tarah kii tippaniyan new jersey ke ratgars vishvavidhyalay ke dharm ke sanyukt praadhyaapak edwin bryant dwaara pradaan kii gayi hai
 Among the six orthodox sects of Hindu philosophy, a Nyaya sect states that karma is a proof of the existence of God; It has been observed that some people are happy in this world, some are in trouble
 kuch amir or kuch garib hai
 The followers of justice explain this by the concept of karma and rebirth
 kisi vyakti vishesh ke karmon kaa fal hardam us vyakti kii pahunch main nahin bhi hota jo ki karmak he; isliye karmon ke falon kaa ek vitarak kaa hona jaruri he or yah sarvocch vitarak bhagwaan he
 Accordingly, this notion of justice is the same as in Vedanta
 hindu dharm, vishesh rup se dharamshastra main, karm ek adarsh he jisame "kaaran or prabhaav ek-duusare se naitik kshetra main avibhajya rup se jude hue hai jaisaa ki vigyaan dwaara bhautik kshetra main kalpit he
 ek achche karm ke liye puraskaar he or ek bure karm ke liye dand he
 agar bure karm kaa kufal is jivan main praapt nahin hota he to aatma anya astitv kaa aarambh karti he or us nae maahaul main guzarate hue purv main kiye gayi karm kaa fal bhogana padataa he
 is prakaar yah samajhnaa jaruri he ki karm kahin jaataa nahin he, vyakti ko apane purv main kiye karmon ke parinaam ke sukh yaa dukh bhogane hi padate hai
 brihadhranyak upanishad kahata he, "vyakti ke karmon ke anusaar or uske vishwaas ke anuroop vah vaisaa hi hoga; jo vyakti saraahneey karm karegaa vah saraahneey hoga or jo vyakti bure karm karegaa vah paapi hoga
 vah shuddh karmon dwaara shuddh or bure karmon dwaara bura banataa he

 The scriptures about karma describe in some detail the possible consequences of karma
 jab punarjanm or ateet ke jivan kii baat aati he to vibhinn prakaar kii vastu ke rup main waapas aane ke bare main praayah charchaa hua karti he
 In this case, it is true, or at least the texts say so
 kathak-grihy-sutara kahata he, "kuch manushya ke garbh main ek samavisht astitv paane ke liye pravesh karte hai; anya apane karmon ke anusaar or apane gyaan ke anusaar ajaivik padaarth main chale jate hai"
 The consequences of karma in relation to sin are discussed more extensively

 yogasutra II

 The following creature has a long list of births and diseases and disabilities, which sinners have to suffer
 Some authors have proposed special branch extensions for specific sins
 For example, "haritasamhita states that the Brahmin's killer is suffering from white leprosy and the cow's killer is suffering from black leprosy
" Although the list of ways to reduce sin is very large and thus reduces bad karma, some authors such as Mitakshar, a commentator of Yajnavalkya Smriti, believe that karma "should not be taken literally, but rather implies Motivating the sinner for atonement because the Creator makes great suffering and trouble unavoidable and anyone willing to take it on their own will Maybe not
 " karmvipak aage kahata he, "ki koi bhi aatma bina aashaa ke nahin hoti basharte yah pratiksha ke liye taiyaar ho or apane bure kaaryon ke liye santaap ke liye taiyaar ho, ki ise un kaaryon main purvabhasith anekanek astitvon dwaara bhaybheet hone kii aavashyaktaa nahin he or ki aatma apni lambii yatra or kramik vikaas main antat apni sachhee mahanata ko pahchaanane main sakasham ho sake or shaashvat shanti tathaa purnataa ko samaj sake
 According to a theistic view, the effects of a person's bad karma can be minimized
 nimnlikhit dharm yaa neki karne se kaise bure karm ko kam kiya ja saktaa he iske udhaaharan hai: achche kaam karnaa, jaise ki dusron kii sahaayta karnaa; bhakthi yoga, yaa dayaa paane ke liye bhagwaan kii puja karnaa; or bhagwaan kii dayaa paane ke liye chidambaram mandir yaa rameswaram jaise pavitra sthalon kii tirthayatra karnaa
 In another example, Ganesha can return the karma of his devotees by simplifying and purifying them, but this can only happen if they establish a personal relationship with them
 bhagwaan kii krupa paane ke udhaaharan kaa adhik varnan neeche he
 The story of Markandeya, who was saved by Shiva from death, tells that God's grace to his beloved devotee can overcome karma and death
 isi tarah kii anya kahani main krishna ne apane guru rishi sandipani ke putr ko mrityu ke devtaa yama ke lok se waapas le aae the; yah jaanate hue bhi ki guru kaa putr apane nij karmon kii vajah se le jaaya gaya tha, lekin apni shakti or yama par aadhipaty kii vajah se unhone use punerjeevit kiya
 Rishi Sandipani was Krishna's guru in his childhood days
 bhagwat puraana main ajamil kii kahani bhi isi bindu kii vyakhya karti he
 Ajamil was involved in a lot of bad things in his life like stealing, leaving his wife and children and marrying a prostitute
 lekin mrityu ke samay usne anichhaa se narayan ke naam kaa jaap kiya or isiilie use moksh mila yaa paramatma se uskaa milan hua or yama ke doot se use bachaa liya gaya
 Actually Ajamil was thinking of his youngest son, also named Narayan
 lekin bhagwaan ke naam kaa shaktishaalee prabhaav he or ajamil ke bade paapon ke liye kshamaa mil gayi or bure karmon ke baavjood use moksh praapt hua
 The Shvetashvatara Upanishads 7 and 12 claim that the doer of the deeds wanders here and there and is reborn according to their deeds, not by the doctrine of grace, praying to the almighty Creator, ie, God
 ishwar sab kaa bahut hi bada sharansthal he or jab ishwar kaa aashirwad praapt ho yaa ishwar kii ichha ho to koi vyakti amarta ko praapt karata he
 By the grace of God, a person can be free from sorrows
 isliye, shwetashwatara upanishad nirvivaad rup se ek param astitv ko maanata he, jisaki krupa se bhakton ko karm ke niyam se chhutkaaraa paane kaa rasta mil jaataa he
 As Adi Shankaracharya wrote in his commentary on Shvetashvatara Upanishad VI: 4, "if we surrender all our deeds to God, we will not be subject to the law of karma
" dharamshastra paap kam karne ke saadhan ke rup main parivartit ho gayi, inamen se kuch kaa samaadhaan karm ke siddhant se karnaa kathin he
 For example, one of these practices is Shraddha or as stated in the Brahma Purana, "whatever is given to a Brahmin in reverence at the proper time, at the proper place, and according to the procedure laid down by the supatra, for the benefit of the fathers
 Means ", it means the honor of the ancestors, although on the contrary, a believer in karma will agree that when the body dies, the soul is automatically another body
 Switch to entry are doing, even if there is memorial of his Purwarjon or does it make no difference
 isliye, karm ke vipareet ken kehete hai ki shraadh main "teen purvajon ko chaaval ke pind kaa nivedan karne ke siddhant kahata he ki 50 yaa 100 saal biit jane ke baad bhi teen purvajon kii aatma hawa ke lahar ke madhyam se apane swargeey kaaya main bhi chaaval ke pind kaa swaad yaa khushboo kaa anand praapt karne main sakasham hoti hai
" nishchit rup se, agar ham shastron, jo kahata he ki karm ko aksharsh: nahin lenaa chahie, main die gaye vivaran ko maan lete hai to do bhinn mat aapas main saamanjasy sthapit kar sakate hai
 However, as evidenced by the various opinions written on the subject, consistency between different views on karma will not be found elsewhere
 aastikwaad mat ke anuyaayi sristi ke chakron main vishwaas karte hai, jahaan aatma ek abuddhik vastu ke rup main keval bhagwaan kii ichha par nirbhar hokar karm ke aadhaar par sharir vishesh kii ore aakarshith hoti he
 For example, Kaushitaki Upanishad 1
2 states that taking birth at different stages of life like worm, insects, fish, fish, lion, pig, snake or human is determined by the actions and knowledge performed by the person
 chandogya upanishad 5
10
7 ne achche janm, jaise ki aadhyatmik parivaar main janm, arthath yaa bura janm, jaise ki kutta yaa suar ke rup main janm lene ke bich ke antar ko bataata he
 Thus, the theory of karma comes to characterize a vast area of different levels of biological evolution, from different species of plants to different types of animals, as to why different types of life appear, and It also explains the differences between different members of the same species like humans
 is prakaar, is tarah ke bahut saare upanishdon kaa kahana he ki karm ke aadhaar par jati vishesh main janm hota he, kaha jaataa he jisane achche karm kiye hai unka janm dharmaparayan parivaar main hota he, jo ki brahman jati kaa hi paryaay he
 Those who do good deeds are born in a pious family, where his future destiny will be determined by his conduct and actions taken in the present life
 gita main krishna ne kaha ki brahman ke abhilakshan uske aacharan dwaara nirdhaarit hote hai, na ki janm dwaara
 gita kaa ek padya is tatv kii vyakhya karata he: "he paranthap! brahman, kshatriya or vaishyon ke tathaa shudron ke karm swabhaav se utpann gunon dwaara vibhakt kiye gaye hai
" In the Gita, the same way is further discussed in this opinion, while explaining the concept of Madhvacharya Varna, the word says that in Hindu society it refers to the division into four social categories on the basis of virtue and karma, by birth it No, but is defined by the nature of the self
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek aatma jisamen brahman kii prakruti he shudra or iske vipareet rup main janm le saktaa he
 According to him, the caste system is decided by birth, in fact the word caste is referred to a particular community; Not for the character
 varna puri tarah se aatma kii sthiti ko paribhaashit karti he, udhaaharan ke liye, brahman ke rup main vargeekrut aatma paanditya kii ore pravruth hoti he; kshatriya aatma vyavastha kii ore or shudra aatma seva karne kii ore pravruth hoti he
 Thus, he gave a new interpretation of the caste system, as he believes that a person's caste is related to his nature and not to his birth; According to Madhava, birth is not determined by varna; The pious enlightened Chandal is far superior to an ignorant Brahmin

 The endosyrene reproductive system consists of the hypothalamus, pituitary, genitalia, and adrenal glands, with reactions and regulation of many other physiological systems
 vaastavik yuvavastha ko "kendriya yuvavastha" kaha jaataa he kyonki yah kendriya tantrika pranali ke prakriya ke kaaran shuru hoti he
 a simple description of hormonal puberty is as follows: is neurohormonal prakriya kii shuruyaat pehle pratyaksh shaareerik parivartan se 1-2 saal pehle ho sakati he
 The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus is the operator of the reproductive system
 isamen neuron hote hai jo piyush granthi ke portal vinos pranali main jienarech kii indriyon ko utpann karte hai
 The arcuate nucleus is affected and controlled by the responses of nerves to other parts of the brain and hormones derived from the genitals, adipose tissues, and a variety of other systems
 piyush granthi rakt ke saamaanya pravaah main, ek spandit pattern main alech va enne ko chhod kar spandit jienarech ke prati prakriya karti he
 The genital, testosterone, and estrogen steroids respond to increased levels of LH and FSH by producing sex hormones
 adrenal granthiyaan steroid hormone ke duusare strot hai
 Adrenal maturation, called adrenarche, typically precedes gonadarche in the middle of childhood
 bhrun jivan ke pratham timahi ke ant tak antahsravi prajnan pranali kaaryaatmak ho jaati he
 The testes and ovaries remain inactive for some time at birth but resume hormonal activity several months after birth, when the brain's incomprehensible mechanism stops the process of the arcuate nucleus
 ise yuvavastha-purv "gonadostate" kii paripakvata ke rup main sanderbhit kiya gaya he, jo sex steroid dwaara nakaaratmak pratikriya ke liye samvedansheel ho jaataa he
 After a period of hormonal activity several months after birth, the stopping process begins which may correspond to the sexuality of the infant, followed by a latency phase, described by Sigmund Freud
 gonodotrophin or sex steroid kaa str bachapan ke lagbhag 8 se 10 saalon ke liye neeche girtaa he 
 is baat ke sakshya badhate ja rahe hai ki bachapan ke varshon main prajnan pranali puri tarah se niskriy nahin hoti
 gonodotrophin indriyon main maamuli vruddhi hoti he or germ koshikaon ke aasapaas dembugranthi kosh main bhavishya main banane vaale andey sankhya main dogune ho jate hai
 Normal puberty in the hypothalamus begins with the inhibition of the pulse generator in the arcuate nucleus
 arcuat nabhik kaa yah nishedh mastishk ke anya kshetron dwaara jari ek sakriy avrodh he
 Signals and mechanisms that exclude the arcuate nucleus from inhibition have been the subject of investigation for decades and are not fully understood
 puure bachapan ke dauraan leptin kaa str badhata rahata he or arcuat nabhik ko prakriya ke liye anumati detaa he
 If the development of the arcuate nucleus in childhood is interrupted prematurely due to brain injury, it can conduct the gonadotrophin senses which will initiate the process of puberty before age
 arcuat nabhik ke neurons pituitary portal pranali ke rakt main gonadotropin chhodane vaale hormone ) kaa srav karte hai
 An American physiologist, Ernst Knobil, found that gnrh signals from the hypothalamus induce the secretion of the pulse (LH) to the pulse at intervals of approximately 1–2 hours
 LH nasen arcuat nabhik ke fadakane se hue gnrh srav ke kaaran banati hai, jo khud, kendriya mastishk pranali ke sanketon yaa sanket utpaadak kii utpann kanpakanpahat se bana he
 Robert M
 Boyer found that gonadotrophin senses burst only in the nid during the first years of physical puberty, but they can be detected by the day they reach puberty
 yuvavastha ke ant tak, gonodotrophin indriyon kii tivrata or aavruti main din va raat ke samay thodaa hi antar hota he
 Some investigators have attributed the resonance of shivering in the brain to the onset of puberty

 Rising levels of adrenal androgens can be identified between 6 and 11 years of age, even before the growth of the genital vein of hypothalamic puberty
 adrenal androgen donon lingon main guptang ke baalo, vayask sharir gandh evam anya androgenic parivartanon ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 The primary medical significance of the difference between adrenarche and gonadarche is that these changes such as the hair and body odor of the genitals do not prove that a child is undergoing puberty
 naron main hypothelemic paripakvata ke praarambhik charan bahut had tak maadaa yuvavastha ke praarambhik charnon ke samaan prathit hote hai, yadhyapi ye unase 1-2 saal baad hote hai
 lhs stimulate the testicular cells of the testes to produce testosterone and blood levels begin to rise
 yuvavastha ke adhikansh samay tak, testosterone kaa raat kaa str din ke str se adhik hota he
 Males have less need for regularity and intensity of increase in reproductive veins than in puberty of females
 haalanki, kishor ladakon main testosterone kaa ek mahatvapurn bhaag estrodeol main badal jaataa he
 Estradiol is responsible for growth spurt, bone maturation and closure of epiphysal in boys like girls
 estrodeol ladakon main ek bade anupaat main stan utak ke vikaas ko bhi prerit karata he
 In boys, when puberty causes mild gynecomastia or swollen nipples, they are told that these effects are temporary due to high levels of estradiol in some male adolescents
 adhiktar yuva purushon main nar hormonal parivartan kishoravastha ke dauraan hota he
 At this point in the life of males, testosterone levels increase gradually and most of the effects are driven through the androgen receptors as changes in the planned organs of dihydrotestosterone
 alech nabz main vruddhi hone ke saath saath, yoni kii theka koshikaayen testosterone or usase kuch kam maatra main projesterone utpann karne lagati hai
 Most testosterone is absorbed into the surrounding cells, called granulosa cells
 enne main thodi vruddhi in granulosa koshikaon kii vikaas ke liye jimmevaar aromatez gatividhiyon ko badhaati he, jo shiraaon main srav ke liye adhikansh testosterone ko estrodeol main badal dete hai
 Increased estradiol levels induce physiological changes related to estrogen characteristics in female puberty: rapid growth, increased or inhibited bone maturation, growth of breasts, increased structure of fat, growth of uterus, increased thickness of membranes and vaginal skin , And increasing the width of the lower pelvis
 jaise jaise estrodeol kaa str dhire dhire badhata he or anya swaabhaavik rup se hone vaali prakriyaaon kaa vikaas hota he, hypothelemic "gonadostate" ke kriyasheel hone kii soochna milte hi vayaskta kaa padaav praapt ho jaataa he
 This achievement of positive feedback is indicative of female sexual maturity, as it allows mid-cycle LH charge for ovulation
 yuvavastha ke dauraan adrenal androgen or testosterone ke str bhi badhate hai, jo maadaa yuvavastha main vishesh androgenic parivartanon ko utpann karte hai: guptangon ke bal, anya androgenic bal jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he, sharir kii gandh, munhaase
 During the entire phase of puberty, hormone levels continue to rise continuously

 Rasul Khuda Silli Allah alaihi ala wasallam has also pointed towards the same thing: namaaz or haj-o-tawaaf ko is liye vaazib qaraar diya gaya he taaki zikr khuda muhaqqiq ho sake Shaheed Mahirab, Imam Mutqeen Hazrat Ali Alaihi Assalam falsaf-e-namaz, narrates this: kudaavand alam ne namaaz ko is liye vaazib qaraar diya he taaki insaan takbbur se paak-o-pakiza ho jaenmaz ke zariye khuda se qareeb ho jaao
 Prayer makes the sins fall from human beings in the same way as dry leaves fall from the procession, Namaz frees humans in such a way that animals are freed by opening the rope from their neck Hazrat Ali Razi Allah Anna hazarat fatima zaharaa salaam allaah alaiha masjid nabavi main apane tarikhi khutabaa main islamic dasto raat ke falsafaa ko byaan faramaate hue namaaz ke bare main ishaara farmaati pain: Khudavand Alam gave a reasonable agreement to Namaz so that humans could get pak-o-pakiza from kibar-o-takbabur and Khud Beeni hisham bin hukum ne imam jaafar sadiq alaihi assalaam se sawaal kiya : namaaz kaa kya falsafaa he ki logon ko kaarobaar se roak diya jaay or un ke liye zahamat kaa sabab bane? imam alaihi assalaam ne is ke jawaab main faramaaya: Many of the prayers have been one of them, one of them is that the first people were free and were disillusioned with the memory of God-o-rasool and during their time there was only the Qur'an, Ummat Muslima was also like Gujatha Ummah because they only gave the deen He had kept the command and left the book and anbaya-e-a and used to cut them to death

 More than God, who has done righteousness and favor with us, more than this, the right to be paid and decorated for Venus

 namaaz khuda kii shukraguzari he or sahib vajadaan insaan namaaz ke vaazib hone ko druk karata he
 When a dog is given a lie in exchange for a bone that is given to him and shakes his tail and attacks it if a thief or a stranger enters the house, then if a human is careless and innocent of all the bad habits of the family If you are pained and bereft of the spirit of Venus, which is lit
