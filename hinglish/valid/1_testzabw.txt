 banaras ke langadaa aam kii janm-katha bhi rochak he
 It is an incident of about two hundred and fifty years ago kehete hai, banaras ke ek chote-se shiv-mandir main, jisamen lagbhag ek acre jameen thi, jo chaahar diwaariyon se ghiri hui thi, ek sadhu aayaa or mandir ke pujari se vahaan kuch din thaharne kii ajna maangi
 The priest said, `` There are many chambers in the temple complex, stay in any one
 sadhu ne ek kamare main dhuni rama di
 The monk had two small mango plants, which he planted with his hands behind the temple
 subah uthte hi vah sarvapratham unako pani diya karata, jaisaa ki kanv tra+shi ke ashram main rahete hue kalidas kii shakuntla kiya karti thi
 The monk looked after those plants with great enthusiasm
 vah chaar saal tak vahaan tehra
 In these four years, the trees became quite large
 chauthe varsh aam kii manjariyaan bhi nikal aayin, jinhen todakar us sadhu ne bhagwaan shankar par chadhaayin
 Then he said to the priest, `` My work is done
 main to ramata jogi hum
 i will leave Benares tomorrow morning
 tum in paudhon kii dekharekh karnaa or inamen fal lagen, to unhen kai bhaagon main katkar bhagwaan shankar par chadha dena, phir prasad ke rup main bhakton main baant dena, lekin bhuulakar bhi samoochaa aam kisi ko mat dena
 Neither let anyone plant a tree pen nor kernel
 guthliyon ko jala daalana, varanaa log use ropakar paudhe bana lenge
 And that monk left Benares
 mandir ke pujari ne bade chaav se un paudhon kii dekharekh kii
 After some time the plants became full trees
 har saal unamem kaaphi fal lagane lage
 The priest did as the monk said
 jin logon ne us aam ko prasad ke rup main khaaya, ve log us aam ke swaad ke diwane ho gayi
 People repeatedly pleaded with the priest to give them the whole mango, so that they could make his plant by bringing his kernels, but the priest refused to do so
 is aam kii charchaa kaashi naresh ke kaanon tak pahaunchi or vah ek din swayan vrikshon ko dekhne ram-nagar se mandir main aa pahunche
 He worshiped Lord Shiva devoutly and inspected the trees
 phir pujari ke samaksh yah prastaav rakhaa ki inaki kalmen lagane kii anumati pradhan-mali ko de den
 The priest said, `` How can i avoid your orders? main aaj hi sandhya-puja ke samay shankaraji se prarthana karuunga or unka sanket paakar swayan kal mahal main aakar sarkaar kaa darshan karuunga or mandir kaa prasad bhi letaa aauunga
 On this night Lord Shankar gave a dream, `` Let the request of the King of Kashi, obey my request and put a pen in the trees
 jitani bhi kalmen vah chahen, lagava len
 Do not interrupt it
 ve kashiraj hai or ek prakaar se is nagar main hamaare pratinidhi swaroop hai
 On the second day, after worshiping in the morning, the priest reached the Kashi King with a mango crate in the form of Prasad
 raja ne prasad ko tatkaal grahan kiya or usamen ek alokik swaad paaya
 The head-gardener of the King of Kashi went and planted many clusters in the mango trees, in which after the rainy season a lot of roots were found
 kalmon ko katkar maharaj ke paas laayaa gaya or unke aadesh par unhen mahal ke parisar main rope diya gaya
 Within a few years, they became trees and started giving fruits

 a small garden was built outside the palace

 Even today those who have had a chance to go around Benares or in the open places of the city, they will be seen in abundance of lame mango trees and orchards
 hindu vishvavidhyalay ke vistrut vishaal praangan main langade aam ke saikadon ped hai
 The thing was that the priest who had proper care of the plants planted by the monk was lame and hence the name of mango born from these trees became lame and till date the mangoes of this caste are famous all over India

 When a heavy body is tied to a rope, and it is seen holding the rope by immersing a heavy body in the water, it is seen that not much force is applied, as much force is exerted by pulling that body out of the water

 The concept of fluid pressure comes to the fore when diagnosing entrapment, that is, a force that the liquid exerts on each surface of the body in contact with itself
 aise daab ke astitv kaa abhas hamen yahi dekhakar mil jaataa he ki chhidr se baahar nikalate hue pani ko rokane ke liye bal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Archimedes' law can be interpreted based on the hypothesis that liquid pressure acts perpendicularly to the surface of the body in contact with the liquid

 Abbreviations denote this by P
 is daab kaa aayam bal prati ekak kshetrafal he
 It can also be proved that if the density of the fluid is constant, the pressure is proportional to the depth and remains the same in the horizontal plane
 is siddhant ke anusaar hi - 'khojahi dadak sadaa nij str'
 This property is used in water management and also the well follicles are able to run for the same reason

 Due to the magnitude of the force being equal to the pressure and the product of the area, applying a small force on a small area is the same as applying a larger force on a piston of a larger area
 jalchaalit daavak, brake aadi isi niyam par aadhaarit hai
 For this reason, the dams are made wider at the base than the top, and those working at extreme depths in water have to wear steel armor to protect against pressure
 drav kaa mukt tal or amishry taralon ke bich kaa tal, donon kshaitij hote hai
 In other words --- the perpendicular force exerted by the liquid on the surface unit area of a plane is called liquid pressure

When a body is partially submerged into several liquids, its load is balanced by the equal charges of the load of the different fluid displaced by the body and each thrust is placed in the vertical direction at the center of gravity of the amount called the buoyancy center
 may be considered

 The equilibrium is temporary when the maximum distance is and permanent when it is minimum
 utplavkatal ke mukhya vakratakendron ko aplav centre kehete hai
 If the gravity center of the body in the subplot center is above c, then the equilibrium for the main displacements corresponding to m is permanent, if below, temporary and if c and m are the same point, the equilibrium is neutral
 ga m utplavan tal par abhilamb hoti he
 In this way, the equilibrium conditions can be determined by pulling the capacitance at the buoyancy plane from c

 The IRR is also called the effective interest rate in terms of savings and loans
 shabd aantarik is tathy ko sandarbhit karata he ki isaki gananaa paryaavarniya karkon ko shaamil nahin karti he 
 An investment or potential investment at an internal rate of return is the annualized effective complex rate of return
 is dar ko poonji nivesh kar arjeet kiya ja saktaa he
 In more familiar terms, the IRR of an investment is the interest rate at which the cost of the investment benefits the investment
 iskaa matlab yah he ki nivesh se hue sabhi laabh dhan ke samay mulya ke nihit hai or isiilie is byaaj dar main nivesh kaa shuddh vartmaan mulya shunya he
 Because the internal rate of return is a measurement rate, it is an indicator of work efficiency, quality, or investment income
 ye shuddh vartmaan mulya ke bilkul vipareet he
 It is an indication of the value or magnitude of the investment
 ek nivesh ko sweekaarya tab mana jaataa he jab uski aantarik pratifal dar vaapasi kii sthapana kii ek nunatam sweekaarya dar se adhik he
 In a scenario where investments are determined by one of the companies which has share holders

 In cases where the capital flows are very irregularly variable, as in the case of life annuity, the expected values are entered in the formula given above

 In this case, numerical methods or graphical methods must be used
 yadi nivesh poonji pravaah ke kram dwaara di ja sakati he to So r { \ displaystyle r} in IRR is given by NPV = − 100 + 40 1 + 59 2 + 55 3 + 20 4 = 0 { \ displaystyle { \ mbox{npv}}=-100+{ \ frac {40}{^{1}}}+{ \ frac {59}{^{2}}}+{ \ frac {55}{^{3}}}+{ \ frac {20}{^{4}}}=0} In this case, the answer is 29%

 For example, using the borer method, r { \ displaystyle r} is given by r n + 1 = r n − NPV n NPV n − NPV n − 1 ) { \ displaystyle r_{n+1}=r_{n}-{ \ mbox{npv}}_{n} \ left}{{ \ mbox{npv}}_{n}-{ \ mbox{npv}}_{n-1}}} \ right)} Where rn { \ displaystyle r_ {n}} is assumed to be th e approximation n { \ displaystyle n} of the IRR

 If the sequence is oriented, iterations of the formula can continue indefinitely so that r { \ displaystyle r} can be found at arbitrary degrees of accuracy

 The use of a financial calculator will simplify this process

 But it should be used only to weigh the importance of a project on the basis of how useful that project is for investing
 un maamalon main jahaan ek pariyojna jisaki shuruuaati nivesh duusari parsparik vishisht pariyojna se zyada hoti he
 The IRR of the first project may be low but its NPV may be high and hence it should be adopted in lieu of the second project pariyojna ke dauraan IRR sakaaratmak nakadi pravaah kii khapat karne kii sochataa he
 If positive capital flows can invest back into the project, then a suitable reinvestment rate will be required which will calculate reinvestment capital flows and hence IRR is reinvested with capital flows
 jab gananaa kii hui IRR, antarim nakad pravaah ke liye vaastavik punarnivesh dar se alag hoti he tab vaarshik samakaksh pratifal ke aankalan ko bilkul sateekta ke saath pratibimbit karegacompany le paas atirikt pariyojnaayen ho sakati hai jo ki antarim nakad pravaah ke nivesh ke liye bilkul utani hi aakarshak apekshaaon vaali ho sakati hai This makes IIR suitable for venture capital valuation and other private equity investments

 But in the end it sees only one cash outflow chunki IRR puunji kii laagat par vichaar nahin karata he, iskaa prayog alag-alag avadhiyon vaali pariyojnaon kii tulana ke liye nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The revised internal return rate considers the cost of capital and gives a better indication of a project's ability to contribute to the firm's discounted cash flow
 sakaaratmak nakadi pravaah ke maamle main jiske peeche nakaaratmak nakadi pravaah chalata rahata he, iiar kaa ekaadhik maan ho saktaa he
 In this case a discount rate can be used to quote cash flow and the IRR calculation can be used for investment cash flow
 yah udhaaharan tab lagu hota he jab ek graahak vishisht mashin ke banane se pehle raashi jamaa karwaata he
 In a series of cash flows, such as an initially invested amount of money, a higher rate of return is best, but is then owned by more than one person
 isliye ek kisi or kii dhan raashi kaa rini hota he, isliye ab kam dar vaale pratifal sabase achche hai
 In this case it is not clear whether more IRR is better or less IRR
 a project can have multiple irrs, as in example 0% and 10%
 is tarah kii pariyojnaon kaa udahaaran khand khan or parmaanu bijli sanyantr hai, jahaan aamtaur par pariyojna ke ant main bahut zyada nakadi bahirpravaah hoti he In general, IRR can be calculated by solving a polynomial criterion
 yadi sameekaran kaa koi vaastaviktaa main adwitiya samaadhaan he to starm sutara kaa prayog tab kiya ja saktaa he
 Generally, the solution of the IRR equation cannot be found in an analytical way but it can be solved by iterative method

 Despite the strong academic choice of NPV, surveys indicate that authorities place more importance on IRR than NPV
 aam taur par, prabandhakon ko alag-alag tarah ke aakaaron ke niveshon kii tulana karnaa aasaan lagata he, agar ye tulana en pi ve ke dollaron se pratifal dar ke pratishat ke bare main ho to
 halaanki, vyapaar ke mulya kii drushti se dekhen to en pi ve phir bhi "adhik sateek" he
 As a measure of investment efficiency, the IRR has better insight into situations such as capital control
 haalaanki, jab parsparik rup se vishisht pariyojnaon kii tulana kii jaati he to en pi ve uchit upaay he
 Mathematical investment value has to pass through some rate of return, according to mathematics the value of investment is used to estimate exponential growth or decay according to some rate of return
 This estimate operates with cash flow impropriety and defines the IRR of a series of cash flows as any return rate that results in zero net present value

 This process is continuous
 -100% shuddh vartmaan mulya ke pratifal dar kii ore chalem to, shuddh vartmaan mulya pichley nakadi pravaah ke chinh ke saath anant kii ore aage badhata he or pratifal dar kaa sakaaratmak anant, shuddh vartmaan mulya pratham nakadi pravaah kii ore bad jaataa he 
 isliye, yadi pehali or aakhri nakadi pravaah ke alag-alag chinh hai to vahaan par aatanrik pratifal dar maujuud he
 Example of time series without IRR: sakaaratmak shrinkhalaaon ke baad vishesh rup se nakaaratmak nakadi pravaah ke maamle main nakadi pravaah kaa kul mulya sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak nakadi pravaah ke bich main samay ke rup main parivartit hota he
 The results of the yield rate function, positive and negative, are constant from infinity and in a similar way, so there is a unique rate of return, for which it is zero, so IRR is also unique
 haalanki iske puure prakshetra main ye zaruri nahin he ki NPV bhi ek saamaan tareeke se kam hota rahe aisa IRR par hota he Similarly, IRR is also unique, especially in terms of positive cash flow and especially negative cash flow

 hindu dharm ke varkari sampradaay dwaara sammanit thi
 According to the most traditional, Kanhopatra was a prostitute and a dancing girl

 He elected to surrender to the Hindu god Vithoba-deity patron without disdain from the concubine of the emperor of Bidar
 vah pangarpur main vithoba ke mukhya mandir main nidhan ho gaya
 Only one person is within the premises of whose samadhi temple
 kanhopatra marathi ovi or abhanga apane peshey ke saath uskaa sheel santulan ke liye vithoba ke prati uski bhakthi or uske sangharsh kii kavita kah likhi thi
 In his poems, Lord Vithoba became his protector and prayed to release him from the clutches of his profession
 uski tees abhanga aaj bhi batch gaya he or aaj bhi loga gaate he
 He is the only female saint Varkari, who has attained purity without the Guru only on the basis of his devotion
 kanhopatra ke itihaas sadiyon se madhyam se log jaanate he ki unke kahaniyon neeche paarit kar diya gaya he or unke kahaniyon me tathy or kalpana karne ke liye mushkil bana gayi he
 People believe about his birth by shaming him and his Moth Vithoba temple when the king of Bidar wanted him
 haalanki, sadashiv malguzar or hausa naukaraani ke paatro unki charitraaon main nahin dikhaai dete he
 Kanhopatra was the daughter of Shama, a wealthy prostitute, who lived in Mangalveda Shehar of Pandharpur
 kanhopatra ke alaava mangalved santon varkari chokhamela or damaaji kaa bhi shamaa kanhopatra ke pita kii pahchaan ke bare main anishchit tha, lekin yah andeh tha ki shahar ke sir main sadashiv malguzar janmasthan he
 Kanhopatra spent her childhood in her mother's palatial house and was served by many maids

 Kanhopatra was trained in dance and song from childhood so that she could join her mother's profession
 vah ek pratibhashali nartki or gayak ban gaye

 shamaa ne kanhopatra ko sujhaaye gaya ki badshaah ko milanaa he, tab jo uski sundarataa or uphaar use paise or gahane puja hogi lekin kanhopatr saaf inkaar kar diya
 Kanhapatra's mother Shama thought of getting Kanhopatra married
 vidwaan tara bhawalkaar kaha gaya he ki kanhopatra kii shaadi ke liye manaa kiya gaya tha kyon ki vah ek daasi ki bethi he
 Kanhopatra did not have hope in the life of a prostitute but had stubbornly stalked her and other people say that she was strongly forbidden to become a prostitute
 kuch lekhakon kaa maananaa he ki ho saktaa he ki vah bhi ek veshya ke rup main kaam kiya he
 Sadashiv Malgujar, the father expected Kanhopatra, heard about Kanhopatra's beauty and wished to see her dance, but refused Kanhopatra
 tadnusaar, sadashiv kanhopatra or shamaa ko pareshaan karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Shama explained to him that he was Kanhopatra's father and thus tried to abandon them, but Sadashiva did not believe him
 vah apane utpeedan jari rakhaa, shamaa ke dhan dhire-dhire samaapt ho gaya
 Eventually, Shama apologizes to Sadashiva and offers to present Kanhopatra to her
 kanhopatra, tathaapi, ek naukaraani ke rup main prachhann uski vruddh naukaraani hausa kii madad se pangarpur ke liye bhaag gaye
 In some legends, Hausa is credited for traveling to Kanhopatra to perform a Varkari devotional as described
 anya khaaton varkari tirthayatriyon jo pangarpur main vithoba mandir ke liye apane raste par kanhopatra ke ghar se paarit credit diya
 According to one story, for example, he asked a Gujara Varkari about Vithoba
 varkari kaha ki vithoba ", udaar budhimaan, sundar or sahi" he, uski mahima kaa varnan se pare he or uski sundarataa se badhkar lakshmi, saundarya kii devi kaa he
 Kanhopatra further asked whether Vithoba would accept him as a devotee and Varkari said that he would accept Kanhopatra
 is aashwaasan,pangarpur jane ke liye uske sankalp ko majboot banaaya
 Kanhopatra immediately leaves Vandoba-ki bhajan Pandharpur-sing with Varkari pilgrims or Pandharpur was a caste with him explaining to his mother
 jab kanhopatra ne pahali bar pangarpur kii vithoba chhavi ko dekha he,tab unhone abhangaon ko gane ke liye shuru kar diya
 She sang in an abhanga that she had fulfilled her spiritual qualifications and was blessed to have seen Vithoba's feet
 vah adwitiya saundarya vah vithoba main uske duulhe kii maang main paaya tha
 He considered himself "married" to God and settled in Pandharpur
 vah samaaj se waapas le liya
 Kanhopatra was taken to a cottage in Pandharpur along with Hausa and lived the life of an ascetic
 vah vithoba mandir main gaaya or nrity kiya tha, or yah ek din main do baar saaf kiya thi

 kanhopatra kii sundarataa ke kisse sunakar badshaah uski rakhel banane ke liye use aadesh diya
 When he refused, the king sent his men to get her by force
 kanhopatra vithoba mandir main sharan lee
 The king's soldiers surrounded the temple and threatened not to destroy it if Kanhopatra was handed over to them
 kanhopatra le jaaya ja rahaa se pehle vithoba ke saath ek pichhali baithak kaa anurodh kiya
 By all Isab, Kanhopatra died at the foot of Vithoba Chitra, but the circumstances were not clear
 lokapriy parampara ke anusaar, kanhopatra shaadi-kuch kanhopatra ke liye intazaar ke ek farm main vithoba kii chhavi ke saath vilay kar diya
 Other theories suggest that he killed himself, or that he was killed for his autocracy
 adhikansh
 Isab says Kanhopatra's body was laid at the feet of Vithoba and then buried near the southern part of the temple
 puranic katha ke sabhi sanskarnon ke anusaar, ek tarati ped-jo uske tirthayatriyon dwaara puja kii jaati he kii maukey par hi samaran-uthi jahaan kanhopatra dafnaaya gaya tha
 Kanhopatra is the only person whose samadhi is in the premises of Vithoba temple
 kai itihaaskaaron kanhopatra ke jivan or mrityu kii tithi ko sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 One estimate gives him his life from about 1428 CE from the Bahamani of Bidar, a king who is often associated with the Kanhopatra story though in most accounts, that king is never explicitly named
 pavaar kaa anumaan he ki vah 1480 main mrityu ho gai thi
 Others suggest dates of 1448, 1468 or 1470, or simply that he lived in the 15th century or, in rare cases, the 13th or 16th century
 jelliot ke anusaar, vah sant-kaviyon chokhamela or namdeva ke samakaleen the
 Kanhopatra is believed to have composed many abhangas, but most were not in writing: only thirty or ovis of him survive today
 sakal sant-gaatha kaha jaataa taees uski kavitaaon ke chand varkari santon ke sankalan main shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Most of these songs are autobiographical, written with an element of compassion
 uski style, kavy upkarnon ke dwaara sade samajhane main aasaan ke rup main varnit he, or abhivyakti kii ek saadagi ke saath kiya jaataa he
 According to Deshpande, the rise of Kanhopatra's poetry and female creative expression reflects the "awakening of Dalits" ignited by the spirit of gender equality enforced by the Varkari tradition
 kanhopatra ke abhanga aksar apane peshey or vithoba ke prati uski bhakthi varkari ke sangrakshak devtaa ke bich uske sangharsh ko chitrit he
 He presents himself as a woman deeply devoted to Vithoba, and begs her to save him from the unbearable bonds of her profession
 kanhopatra uskaa apmaan or samaaj se uske nirvaasan apane peshey or saamaajik kad ke kaaran ke bolti he
 In Nako, Devaraya Anta Aata is believed to be the last unhappiness of her life-incapable to bear the thought of her separation from God, Kanhopatra also gives birth to Vithoba to end her suffering

 patisambhidamagg, khuddak nikaay kaa 12vaan granth he
 It has the representation of four types of knowledge that help in achieving Aryabhoomi
 isaliye yah granth "patisambhidabhagg" kehalaata he
 From the point of view of cognition, all religions have been divided in five ways - khyadi jin dharmon kaa swalakshan sambandhi gyaan praapt karnaa he, ve parigyeya hai
 Unskilled religions that are due are hallucinations
 kushal dharm jinka abhyaas karnaa he, bhavitavya he
 The efficient religion to be practiced is Bhavitavya
 dhyaan, vmoksha, maarg faladi dharm or visheshat: nirvana saakshaat kartavya hai
 The realization of this feeling helps four types of patisambhida - dhamma-patisambhida, atth patisambhida, niruti patisambhida and patibhan-patisambhida
 tatwambodh ke liye sabhi dharmaparyaayon kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 It is obtained from Dhamma Patisambhida
 dharmon ke arth kii gaharaai main pravesh karte he
 And get their true knowledge: this is called the Eight Patisambhida
 dharm or arth donon bhashaa par ashrith hai
 Therefore knowledge of language is also required for the attainment of theology and economism
 yah nirutti patisambhida se sambhav he
 The only objective of the above three patisambhidas is metaphysics, the attainment of which is called patibhan patisambhida
 sabhi arya pudgalon ko apni apni avasthaa ke anusaar pratisanvid gyaan hota he
 But in the state of eligibility, it attains perfection
 patisambhidamagg ke teen vagg hai, jinka namakaran pariman ke anusaar hua he
 Mahavagga, Majjhimvagg and Chullavagg
 doosraa or teesraa kramash: yuganddhavagg or mahapanthavagg bhi kehalaate hai
 There are ten divisions of each wag, which are called stories, they are as follows: 1
 mahavagg : nanakatha, vitthiktha, anapanastiktha, indriyakatha, vimokkhakatha, gatiktha, kammakatha, vipallasakatha, maggakatha or mandapeyyakatha
 2
 Majjhim Vagga: Yuganadhkatha, Sathkatha, Bojjhangakatha, Mettakatha, Viragakatha, Patisambhidakatha, Dhammachakkatha, Lokudakatha Balakatha and Summakatha
 3
 chullavagg : mahapannakatha, iddhikatha, abhismaykatha, vivekkatha, chariyakatha, patihariyakatha, samasisakatha satipatthanaktha vipassanakatha or matikakatha
 The stories are serialized
 atthkatha ke anusaar 30 kathaon main nanakatha ko pehla sthaan isaliye diya gaya he, kyonki samyak drushti hi buddhadeshit maarg kaa pratham ang he
 Falsehood is overcome by knowledge
 isaliye nanakatha ke baad hi vittikatha di gai he
 With the removal of misconception, the mind is attuned
 samadhibhaavna main satipatthan kaa pramukh sthaan he
 That is why the Aanapanatakatha story is given only after the Dittikatha
 shraddhadi paanch indriyon ke abhyaas se anapan smriti pusht ho jaati he
 That is why the sense story has been given only after the Anapananasatakatha story
 indriyon ke abhyaas se chitt bandhanmukt ho jaataa he
 That is why democracies are given only after the senses
 sabhi yoniyon ke jeev moksh praapt nahin kar sakate
 Only those who are born in the world of consciousness can receive it
 isaliye vimokkhakatha ke baad hi gatiktha di gai he
 The speed of an organism is according to its order
 isaliye gatiktha ke baad hi kammakatha di gai he
 Creatures perform due to four types of antithesis
 isajiye kammakatha ke baad di vipallaas katha or magg kathaayen di gai hai
 The final tale of this wagga is the Mandpayya Katha
 mand kaa arth he saar
 Its progress has been for Aryamarga
 isi prakaar anya kathaon kii bhi krambaddhata dikhaai gai he
 Most of the themes mentioned in these stories are dependent on one thread
 vastav main kisi sutt ke vivaran ke rup main hi vishay kii vyakhya kii gai he
 These interpretations have great significance
 isaliye baad kii atthakathaon main un vishyon ke vivaran main patisbhidaamagg kii vyakhyaaon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 There is a plurality of them in Vishuddhimarga
 patisambhidamagg kii style, jo vishleshnatmak he, abhidhamm kii style se milti he
 That is why some scholars have suggested the suitability of doing it under Abhidhamma Pitaka
 lekin, jaisaa upar ullekh kiya gaya he, prayek vishay kaa vivaran kisi na kisi suttant par aadhaarit he
 Elsewhere religion religions have also been analyzed in terms of Abhidharma system
 in baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ham kah sakate hai ki pracheen suttanton ke sangrah ke baad or abhidharmpitak ke sampadan ke pehle, madhya yug main, is granth kii rachana hui hogi
 Sariputta Ther has been described as the author of Patisambhidamagg in the eight story
 aadhunik vidvan ise maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 But the recognition of the story is also not unfounded
 is granth kii style sariputt ther ke suttanton kii style ke samaan he
 The Sanamaditti, Sampasandania Sangeetipariya, Dasudas and Mahavedalla Sutta are some examples of this
 haan bhagwaan or unke katipay anya shishyon ke suttant bhi isamen sangruhit hai lekin sariputt ther ke suttanton kii hi pramukhataa he
 Probably because of this, the ancient tradition would have been in favor of calling Sariputta Ther the author of Patisambhidamagg

 The top hat was visible between Dedalus's aunt in blue and Dudley in the back
 Privet car drive ke ant main thik ho gaya, apni khidkiyaan ek pal ke liye laal rang ab suryaast main jala diya or phir vah chalaa gaya tha
 Harry picked up Hedwig's cage, his Firebolt and gave his rucksack a last sweeping view of his unnaturally clean bedroom, and then down his unsightly way back to the hall, where he collected the cage, sewer and bag near the foot of the stairs
 The light was fast fading, the hall filled with shadows in the evening light
 yah sabase ajeeb laga chuppi main yahan khadey raho or pataa he ki vah pichhali baar ke liye ghar chhodane ke bare main tha
 Long ago, when he was left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, hours of solitude were a rare treat
 keval roak frij main se kuch swaadisht chupake, vah upar le jaaya karne ke liye kiya tha Dudley computer par khilne yaa televijan par rakh diya or apane dil kii saamagree ke liye channelon ke madhyam se flicked
 yah use diya tha ek ajeeb, khaali mahasoos kar un baar yaad he, yah ek chota bhai jise vah kho diya tha yaad kii tarah tha
 "don't you want to take one last look in place?" Asked Hedwig, who was still depressed with her head under her wings
 "we'll never be here again
 You don't want to miss all the good times? i mean, look at this doormat
 Memories 


 after Dudley sobbed i saved her from the dementors 


 What turns out to be grateful after all that Was, can you believe it? And 


 Last summer, Dumbledore went through that front door 


 "harry lost his thread of thoughts for a moment and Hedwig went to help Did nothing to bring him back, but he The Wings continued to sit down with his head
 harry ke saamne ke daravaaje par apni waapas kar diya
 "and under here, Hedwig" - Harry pulled a door down the open stairs - "where i used to sleep! You never knew me then - blimey, it's small, i forgot
 

 " harry stacked juute or yaad kaise vah har subah jagaane ke liye istemaal kiya seedhi he, jo adhik se adhik tha aksar ek makadi yaa do ke saath nahin sajaa ke neeche kii talash main upar chhatriyon par chaaron ore dekha
 un dinon kiya gaya tha isse pehle ki vah uski asli pahchaan ke bare main kuch janaa jaataa tha, isse pehle ki vah baahar paaya tha ki kaise apane mata pita mar gaya tha yaa aisi ajeeb baaten aksar uske aasapaas hua kyon
 lekin harry ab bhi sapana hota he ki use hathi tha yaad saktaa he, un dinon main bhi: uljhan main hari batti or ek baar kii chamak ko shaamil sapane - chachaa Vernon tha lagbhag car jab harry yah recounted tha - ek udaan motorcycle durghatnagrast ho gaya
 

 there was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere
 harry ke saath street ek jhatka or kam darwaja frem par uske sir ke upar maar
 roak keval chachaa choicest shabdon kasam Vernon, vah rasoi main waapas compit ke kuch kaam karne ke liye, uske sir pakadakar or peeche bageeche main khidki se baahar ghur
 andhere main rippling hona prathit hota he, hawa main hi spandan
 uthaaya to phir, ek ek karke, aankade unke mohabhang aakarshan ke rup main pop drushti shuru kiya
 Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and riding a huge motorcycle with a black enclosed sidecar
 All the other people around him were dismounting with a broom and in two cases, skeletons, black winged horses
 Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled between them
 There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapping her on the back and Hagrid said, "all righ ', Harry? Ready fer off?" "of course Harry said those Smiling around in all
 "but i did not expect many of you!" "the plan changes the mad-eye, which was holding two huge bulging sacks and the magical whose eye was spinning from the darkening sky of the house with lofty rapidity
 In the garden, "growled" 
 "let's get undercover before we talk you through it

 "kingsley, i thought? He called in the room you were looking after Muggle Prime Minister"
 "you can get along for a night without me," Kingsley said, "you have been more important
 " "harry, lagata he kya?" kapade dhone kii mashin ke sheersh par use baseraa Tonks se kaha or vah us par uske baayen haath wiggled, ek anguthi vahaan glistened
 "aap shaadi shuda he? harry yelped se use lupin ke liye dekh rahaa he"
 "mujhe khed he ki vahaan nahin hoga, harry saktaa hoon, yah bahut hi shant tha
 "" This is fantastic Congrat, - "" All is well across the noisy, well, we'll have a comfy catch time later, "moody roared and silence fell into the kitchen
 mudi uske paanvon par gira diya or uski boriyon harry liye badal gaya
 "as Dedalus probably said to you, we have gone on to abandon the plan A
 Pius Thicknesse, which gives us was a big problem

 "harry may see a malfunction in the plan, but he may give them a chance to find a mad-eye to hold his tongue
 "ab, apni maan ke aakarshan keval do sharton ke tahat tod degaa: jab aap umr, yaa" aa - mudi pracheen rasoighar ke aasapaas ishaara kiya - "aap ab is jagah par ghar kehete hai
 You and your uncle and aunt are going their separate ways tonight, in the full sense that you are going to live together again, right? "harry nodded
 "is samay to, jab aap ko chhod, vahaan waapas nahin ja rahaa hoon or aakarshan pal todane aap apni seemaa ke baahar ho jaaegi

 They all look like the place we're going to hide you, they all may have got some connection with the order: My house is found, Kingsley is the place, Aunt Muriel - you get the idea Molly "yes Harry, not completely truthfully," said because he can still spot a distance hole in the plan
 "aap he Tonks mata pita ke liye ja rahaa hoon

 "nahin!", shaleenta kaa ek sanket ke saath Hermione "maine unhen bataaya ki aap ise is tarah le leni chahie" kaha
 "yadi aapako lagata he ki main jane ke liye chah logon ko apni - jaan jokhim ja rahaa hoon!" "-kyonki yah ham sab ke liye pehali baar he ron," kaha
 "yah alag he, mujhe hone kaa naatak -" "thik he, ham main se koi vastav main yah kalpana, harry fred," jor dekar kaha tha
 "imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, dry gits forever

 "aap yah nahin kar agar main sahyog nahin kar sakate, tumhen meri jarurat ke liye aap kuch bal de

 "jaahir he ham sabhi par koi mauka nahin apane baalo kaa ek sa ho rahi he jab tak aap sahyog he
 "yes, thirteen of us against a boy who is not allowed to use magic, we have no chance," said Fred
 "funny," said Harry, "really amusing
" "if it came to force, then it would be," Moody, his magical eye now growled a small quivering eye in his socket as he glared at Harry
 "over here, Potter everybody and they all Ready to take risks
 " Mundungus sarka diya or grimaced, jaadui aankh nazar bagal swerved he mudi sir kii taraf se baahar us par
 "chalo koi or tark he
 Is wearing on time
 i want some of my hair, boy, now
 "but it's crazy, there's no need -"! "no need!" Moody snarled
 "you know who's out there with half and half towards your ministry? Potters, if we are lucky he will have swallowed fake bait and he will be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but he will eat one or two to eat nuts, keep an eye out, this is not what i want Will happen
 They will not be able to get themselves or hold their mother's charm while in this house, but it is about to break down and they know the location of the rough place
 hamaare hi mauka karne ke liye decoys kaa upyog he
 You, too, know who cannot divide themselves into seven
 "harry caught Hermione's eye and looked away at once
" So, Potter - something of your hair, if you please
 "harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in the same way home
!" Now "moody barked
 With all of his eyes on her, Harry reached over his head, grabbed a hank of hair and pulled
" ", mudi ne kaha ki acha he," aage langadaa ke rup main vah aushadhi kii kuppi se baahar daat khinch liya
 "straight in here, if you please
" Harry plunged the hair into mudlike liquid
 yah kshan isaki sataha ke saath sampark kiya, aushadhi jhaag or dhumrapaan karne ke liye, to phir shuru hua, sabhi ek hi baar main, yah ek spasht, ujjwal sone diya
 "oh, you look a lot tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry," Hermione said, before Ron caught sight of the eyebrows, blushing a little and said, "oh, you know what i mean - what Goyle's Potion Tasted like a box
 "moody said," Okay then, fake potter line up here, so please "
 Aunts Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Fleur are standing in front of the dark blue sink gleaming
 , lupin ne kaha, "ham ek kam kar rahe hai"
 "yahaan kaha," Hagrid gruffly or vah gardan ke jhonta dwaara Mundungus uthaaya or use Fleur, jo apane lakshya karke naak jhurriyon vaali hoti he or saath main sthanantarit karne ke liye fred or jorge bajaay bich khadey bagal main neeche gira diya
 "i'm a soldier, i will soon be a defender," said Mundungus
 "stop it moody," growled
 "as i have already told you, you spineless worm, devouring in any death we will aim to capture Potter, do not kill him
 Dumbledore always said you know who wants to end Potter in person
 It will be the guardians who have got to worry about the most, Death Eaters'll want to kill them
 " Mundungus vishesh rup se aashwast nahin lag rahe, lekin mudi pehle se hi aadha darjan and kii paatr aakaar chashma tha uski, prayek main ek chota sa Polyjuice aushadhi daalane ke liye pehle barasati jo vah baahar haath, andar se khinch rahaa he
 "overall, so


" Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur and Mundungus drank
 All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats, but once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax
 Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward, Ron, Fred and George were shrinking, their hair was darkening, Hermione's and Fleur's appearance backward to shoot in their skulls
 mudi, kaaphi udasin, ab badi boriyon vah uske saath laayaa tha ke sambandhon ko dhilaa kiya gaya tha
 When he is straight again, there were six panting Harry potters and panting in front of him
 fred or jorge ek duusare se badal diya or ek saath kaha, "vaah - ham samaan rahe hai!" "fred ne kaha mujhe pataa nahin, haalanki, mujhe lagata he main abhi bhi behatar dikhne", kettle main apane pratibimb kaa pareekshan
 "bah," Fleur ne kaha, khud ko microwave darwaja main jaanch vidheyak, "mujhe nahin lagata he - main 'ideous hoon
" "ve kapade jiskaa thodaa pailaa hai, main chote mil gaya he yahan mudi, pehali bori kaa sanket," or upaadhyaksh, "pratikul kaha
 chashma mat bhoolanaa, vahaan paksh jeb main chah jode hai
 And when you're ready, there's other stuff in the sack
 " asli harry ne sochaa ki yah sirf sabase vicitra baat he ki vah kabhi dekha tha ho saktaa he or vah kuch bahut ajeeb baaten dekha tha
 He watched in his six sacks as rummaged doppelgangers, pulling out sets of clothes, turning on glasses, stuffing his own things away
 He began to ask them to show a little more respect for privacy as they separated away from all impunity, with his body displaying more clearly than he would with his own self
 Felt like , ron ne kaha, "main jaanata tha ki jini tatu ke bare main jhooth bol rahaa tha," apane nange seene par neeche dekh rahe hai
 "your vision is really terrible", said Harry Hermione, as she put on the glasses
 ek baar kapade pahane, nakli Harrys rucksacks or ullu cages, le ek bharwaan duusari bori se barfili ullu, jisamen prayek
 ", mudi, par ke rup main pichley saat kaha acha" kapade pahane, chashmadhari or saamaan se ladi Harrys use saamana karnaa padaa
 "jode ke rup main nimnanusaar ho: Mundungus mere saath yatra hogi jhaadu se hoga, -" ? "main tumhaare saath Why'm" peeche ke daravaaje paas harry grunted
 "kyonki tum ek he ki dekhne kii jarurat he rahe hai," mudi growled or yakeen he ki paryaapt he, apni jaadui aankh nahin ke rup main vah jari rakhaa Mundungus, "arthur or fred se laharnaa kiya -" ", judawaan kaha ki main jorge rahaa hoon" jise mudi ishaara tha
 "you also tell us except when we can't be Harry?" "sorry, George -" "i'm only yanking your stick, I'm really Fred -"! "messing around enough" Moody snarled
 The other - a George or Fred or whatever you're doing - you're with Remus
 "miss - Delacour" "i'm taking on a thestral Fleur," Bill said
 "she is not fond of brooms
 " Fleur ke upar chalaa gaya use bagal main khadaa he, use ek barsaati, slav lag rahi he ki harry apane puure dil se aashaa prakat phir se uske chehre par kabhi nahin de rahi he
 "miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral" - Hermione seemed confident as she answered Kingsley's smile, knowing that Hermione Harry also lacked confidence on a broomstick
 "which leaves you and me! Ron" said Tonks glowingly, knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him
 ron ke rup main kaaphi ke rup main Hermione khush nahin lag rahi thi
 "an 'are you with me, Harry
 All that righ'?" Exclaimed Hagrid, looking a little worried
 "we'll be on the bike, 'can't take the weight of a thestrals sweep me, see
 There's not much of an o' room on the seat with me, though, so you'll be in the sidecar"
 "harry, not completely, truthfully said that it's great
" ", mudi, jo lagata he ki harry mahasoos kar rahaa tha lag rahaa tha ne kaha, "hamen lagata he ki maut bhakshan aap ek jhaadu par hone kii ummid karenge
 ", to agar ham kisi bhi maut bhakshan main chalaa saktaa hoon snap he bahut samay ke liye unhen sab kuch bataanaa tha ke bare main aap vah pehle kabhi nahin bataaya he, ham kar rahe hai ve ek kumhaar, jo ek naala par ghar main lag rahaa he kaa chayan karenge shart
 thik he phir, "vah chalaa gaya, upar main yah nakli 'kumhaar kapade or pramukh ke saath bori baandhne darwaja waapas karne ke liye tarika he, "main ise banane ke teen minute tak hamen janaa chaiye
 koi peeche ke daravaaje band bindu, yah maut bhakshan nahin rakh baahar jab ve dekh aa jayega
 chalo 


 " harry ko apane ruksaa, Firebolt or Hedwig pinjre ikattha jaldbaaji or andhere waapas bageeche main samooh kaa paalan kiya
 There were bounce hands on the broomsticks on each side, Hermione had already been a great Kingsley for help, the other the black Thestral by Fleur by Bill
 Hagrid stood ready near the motorcycle, but goggles
 "is that it? Is this Sirius bike?", Hagrid said, "very," smiling down at Harry
 "an 'last time it was on him, Harry, i could fit this in one hand!" Harry couldn't help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar
 use rakhaa gaya or sab log neeche kai foot: ron uski drushti ek bharpoor car main ek bachche kii tarah vahaan baithe par smirked
 harry apane ruksaa or apane pairon se neeche naala bharwaan or apane ghutanon ke bich Hedwig pinjre rammed
 vah bahut pareshaan tha
 "hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry's trouble," said Arthur a bit o 'tinkerin'
 He himself settled the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground
 "yah apni aasteen upar kuch chaal ab mil gaya he
 'tha is my idea
 tha "vah speedometer ke paas ek bangnee rang ke batan par ek moti ungali uthaai
 "kripaya saavdhaan rahanaa Hagrid
" shri visli, jo unke paas khadaa tha uske pakade naala kaha tha
 "i'm still not sure that was appropriate and it would certainly only be used in emergencies
" "OK then
" Moody said
 "everyone is ready, please
 i want all of us to leave the whole point at the same time or turn lost
" Everyone motioned their heads
 "now hold on tight, Ron," Tonks said, before Ron and Harry watched, throwing a forced, guilty look at Lupine before placing his hands on each side of her waist
 Hagrid jivan main motorcycle laat maari: yah ek ajgar kii tarah garjana kii or maadak dravya kaanpana karne ke liye shuru kiya
 "good luck, everyone," Moody shouted
 "look at all of you on the bill in about an hour
 On the count of three
 One 


 two 


 three
" There was a great roar from the motorcycle and Harry felt the substance give a dirty destitute
 vah hawa ke madhyam se teji se bad rahaa tha, uski aankhon se thodaa pani, uskaa cheharaa peeche wheepd bal
 chaaron ore use jhaadu upar kii ore badhate the bhi, ek thestral flicked ateet kii lambii kaali poonch
 uske pair, he Hedwig pinjre or unke dwaara maadak dravya ruksaa main jam, pehle se hi naaraaz the or sunn janaa shuru
 itani mahaan uski pareshaani he ki vah lagbhag sankhya kii ek jhalak pichley chaar privet drive le janaa bhul gaya tha
 Ever since he looked on the side of the sidecar he could now tell which one it was
 And then, out of nowhere, they were surrounded
 kam se kam tees hooded aankade, midair main nilambit kar diya, jo bich ke aadesh ke sadasyon ko badi thi, anjaan main ek vishaal sarkal kaa gathan - chikhen, har taraf hare prakaash kii ek lau: Hagrid ek chillaao diya or motorcycle par ludhaka
 harry ke kisi bhi bhaavana ko kho diya he jahaan ve the
 Streetlights above him, screams around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life
 Hedwig he pinjre, Firebolt or apane ruksaa apane ghutane ke neeche se phisal - "- koi madad nahin!" naala bhi kata he, lekin vah sirf apane ruksaa kaa patta jabt or pinjre ke sheersh prabandhan ke rup main motorcycle sahi tareeke se phir se swung
 ek duusare raahat or phir hare prakaash kii ek or fat
 ullu rukii or pinjre ke tal par gir gaya
 "- No no!" As the motorcycle progresses, Harry glimpses Death's hooded scattering devour as Hagrid explodes through his circle
 "hedwig - Hedwig" But the hoot is immobile and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage
 He cannot take it and for others his terror is paramount
 vah apane kandhe par glanced or duuri main band udanevaala jhaadu par chalati log, hari prakaash kii flares ke ek jan, logon ke do jode ko dekha, lekin vah nahin bataa saktaa he jo ve the - "hagrid, ham waapas jane ke liye mil gaya he, hamen waapas janaa he!" unhone ingine ke garajandaar garjan par chillaaya, uski chadi khinch, manzil main he Hedwig pinjre ramming, vishwaas he ki vah mar gaya tha manaa kar
 "hagrid, gum jaao!" "meri naukari aatankwaad tum vahaan ho surakshit, harry!" Hagrid bellow or vah dam ghutana kholaa
 "- band karo band karo!" harry chillaaya, lekin jaise hi vah phir se waapas dekha hari batti ke do jet vimaanon uske baayen kaan pichley uda: chaar kii maut bhakshan dur chakra se tut gaya tha rahe the or unhen peechha he, Hagrid vyapak waapas karne ke liye lakshya
 Hagrid swerved, lekin maut bhakshan ko bike ke saath rakhte the or shaap ke baad unhen goli maar di or harry ko maadak dravya main kam sinc karne ke liye un se bachane tha
 Wriggling around he cried, "amazed!" And a red bolt of light shot from his stick, cleaving a gap between the four devouring death chases as they scattered to avoid it
 "wait, Harry, what will it do for 'em!" At the time of seeing Hagrid roared and Harry just saw a green button close to the fuel gauge with a fat finger in Hagrid
 a wall, a solid black colored wall, erupted out the exhaust pipe
 Craning his neck, Harry saw it expand into existence in midair
 The three Death Eaters swerved and saved it, but the fourth was not so lucky, she vanished from the scene and then dropped it from behind like a stone, breaking its sewer into pieces
 ek apane saathiyon ke liye dhimaa karne ke liye use bachaane ke liye, lekin ve or hawaii diwaar andhere ne nigal liya gaya ke rup main Hagrid handlebars par kam leaned or nikal
 adhik hatya shaap shesh do kii maut 'bhakshan wands se pichley harry sir ud gaya or ve Hagrid ke liye lakshya the
 Harry further responded with stunning spells: splashes of red and multicolored green sparks colliding in midair and Harry thought wildly of fireworks and muggles down who wouldn't know what would be happening - "here we go again, Harry, wait!" Hagrid yelled and he jabbed at a second button
 Take the exit of the net burst from a great this time, but Death Eaters were ready for it
 itnaa hi nahin ve ise se bachane ke liye bhatakana tha, lekin saathi jo apane dost ko bachaane ke behosh dhimaa tha pakadaa tha
 He blossomed suddenly out of the darkness and now all three were pursuing the motorcycle, cursing all the shoots after it
 "it'll hold him tight, Harry!" Hagrid yelled and saw Harry slam his entire hand on the purple button near the speedometer
 The exhaust, white and blue hot with an unmistakable bellowing roar and the motorcycle shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal, the dragon burst fire
 Harry saw death eaters wandering out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: the metal connection to its bike was splintered with the force of acceleration
 "yah sab 'righ, harry he!" bellowed Hagrid, ab gati kii vruddhi dwaara peeth par flats phenkaa, koi bhi ab stearing tha or bike ke Slipstream main hinsak mode karne ke liye shuru maadak dravya
 "main us par hoon, harry don ',' chintaa mat!" Hagrid chillaaya or uski jacket kii jeb ke andar se vah apane gulabi phulon chaataa khinch liya
 "no! Hagrid! Let me go!" "REPARO!" There was a deafening explosion and the intoxicants completely broke away from the bike
 harry aage nikal, is bike kii udaan kii prerana se prerit he, to maadak dravya oonchai khone ke liye shuru kiya - hataasha main harry maadak dravya main apni chadi uthaai or chillaaya, "wingardium Leviosa!" maadak dravya ek kaag, unsteerable tarah gulab lekin kam se kam abhi bhi hawaii main
 vah tha, lekin ek duusare raahat vibhajit he, haalanki, ke rup main adhik shaap use pichley rekhadaar: teen kii maut bhakshan andar band ho gaye the "main aa rahi, harry!" Hagrid andhere ke baahar se chillaaya, lekin harry ke liye phir se sinc: vah rup ke rup main kam Crouching, vah aanevaala ke aankade ke bich main bataaya saktaa he or chillaaya, "maadak dravya avrodh shuruyaat ko mahasoos kar saktaa!" manahuus seene main madhya maut khaane maaraa, ek pal aadmi morrkhtaa se kiya gaya tha-fail midair main eagled ke rup main haalanki vah ek adrishy baadha maaraa tha: ek apane saathiyon ke lagbhag uske saath takaraa ke liye - to maadak dravya ko bayana main girane lage or shesh maut khaanevaala ek abhishaap shot to harry ke kareeb he ki vah car kii rim ke neeche batakh ke liye kiya tha, baahar apni seat ke kinare par ek daant dastak - "main aa rahi, harry, main aa rahi!" ek bada haath he harry vastra ke peeche he or use jabt plummeting maadak dravya ke baahar fahraaya, harry uske saath apane ruksaa khinchaa ke rup main vah khud ko motorcycle seat par ghasita or apane aap ko waapas karne vaali Hagrid ke saath waapas mil gaya
 As they soared upward, devouring the two deaths out of his mouth, Harry spat the remaining blood, lifted his wand into the sidecar and shouted, "confringo!" He knew it as a terrible, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig, the death-eating explosion was near, his broom exploded and fell from sight, his companions fell back and vanished
 , Hagrid moaned "harry, main maafee chahta hoon, main maafee chahta hoon", "main yah meself shouldn'ta aatankwaad kii marammat kii koshish kii - yeh've koi jagah nahin mila he -" "yah ek samasya nahin he, sirf udate raho!" harry waapas chillaaya, ke rup main do or maut bhakshan andhere se baahar ubhara kareeb drawing
 shaap bich antariksh main shooting phir se aayaa, Hagrid swerved or zigzagged: harry ke rup main jaanata tha Hagrid nahin ajgar viraam batan phir se istemaal karne kii himmat, harry ke saath itnaa asurakshit baitha he
 Harry sent the spelling back after stunning the spelling back in its pursuit, barely holding them away
 He swerved another blocked wretched shot at them: the Death Eater escaped to the nearest and slipped his hood and by the red light of his next stunning spell, Harry Stanley saw Shunpike's strange blank face - Stan - "expelliarmus!" Harry shouted
 "yah vahi he, yah vah he, yah asli he!" Hooded maut khaane kaa chillaao he motorcycle ingine kii gadgadaahat se upar bhi pahunch harry: aglaa pal, donon peechha waapas gir gaya tha or drishy se gaayab ho gaya
 "harry, what has happened?" bellowed Hagrid
 "where've they gone?" "I do not know!" But Harry was afraid:! Hooded Death Eater had screamed, "this is real", how did he know? He apparently gazed around in the empty darkness and felt his danger
 ve kahan the? vah chaaron ore kii seat par sawari karne ke liye aage chehre or Hagrid jacket ke peeche kii pakad par kabja kiya
 "hagrid, Python Cease to do it again, let's get out of here!" "hold on tight, then, Harry!" There was a deafening roar, weeping again and the fire shot from the white blue exit: Harry felt himself slipping away from behind what little of the seat he had
 Hagrid flung backward on him, barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars - "I think we've lost them Harry, i think we've done it!" Shouted Hagrid
 lekin harry aashwast nahin tha, dar use agosh main ke rup main vah dekha peechha chhod diya or sahi ke liye vah aa jayega yakeen tha
 
 
 
 Why did they fall back? One of them was still a stick
 
 
 
 yah vahi he
 
 
 This is real
 
 
 
 unhone kaha tha ki yah sahi hone ke baad vah behathiyaar sten karne kii koshish kii thi
 
 
 
 "we're almost there, Harry, we're almost done!" Shouted Hagrid
 harry len ek chote se drop mahasoos kiya he, haalanki roshni jameen par neeche abhi bhi sitaron ke rup main duurastha lag rahaa tha
 Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire: as a death appeared on either side of the eating bike, Harry was missed by two millimeters of curse, cast from behind - and then looked at Harry
 Voldemort was blowing like smoke on the air, gripping him out of the ink like a snake or thestral, his snake-like face gleaming out of ink, his white fingers lifting his rod again - Hagrid bellow fearing to go out and steered the motorcycle in a vertical dive
 Hold on for dear life, Harry sent whirling spells flying at random at night
 unhone dekha ek sharir use pichley udana or pataa tha ki vah unamem se ek maaraa tha, lekin phir vah ek dhamaakaa suna or dekha ingine se sparks, motorcycle hawa ke madhyam se spiraled puri tarah se niyantran se baahar ho, - prakaash shot ke un pichley green phir jet
 harry nahin he jo rasta pataa tha upar, neeche jo: unke nishaan abhi bhi jal rahaa tha, vah kisi duusare par marane kii sambhaavna he
 He had a hooded figure on a brook with his hands on it, he saw that he extended his hand - "no!" a shout of fury started with Hagrid himself on the bike eating death, to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and Death eating, the falls are out of sight, too much groove for them combined weight - barely of their knees
 Excited with the plummeting bike, Harry Voldemort heard my scream, "!" It was over: he couldn't see or hear where Voldemort was, he swooping out of the way to eat another death, "and Avada heard the glimpse -" Harry's pain forced from the scar as his eyes closed, his wand
 Worked out of its own accord
 unhone mahasoos kiya vah apane haath ke aasapaas kuch mahaan chumbak kii tarah, uski aadhi band palkon ke madhyam se sone kii aag kii ek oochaal dekha khinchate hai, ek daraar or rosh kii ek cheekh suni
 shesh maut khaane chillaaya, Voldemort chillaaya, "nahin!" kisi tarah, harry uski naak ajgar viraam batan se ek inch mil gaya
 He punched with his free hand and the bike shot more fire into the air, hurtling straight towards the ground
 "hagrid!" Harry says, holding onto the bike for dear life
 "- Hagrid Accio Hagrid!" The motorbike flew up, sucked in the direction of the earth
 Level face with handlebars, Harry grows nothing but lights up near and far: he was going to crash and there was nothing he could not do about it
 uske peeche ek or cheekh aayaa, "aapkaa chadi, Selwyn, mujhe apni chadi dena!" vah Voldemort laga isse pehle ki vah use dekha
 bagal main dekh rahe hai, vah laal aankhon main stared or yakeen he ki ve aakhri baat usne kabhi dekha: Voldemort use ek baar or shaap kii taiyaari kii jaaegi tha - or phir gaayab ho Voldemort
 harry neeche dekha or dekha Hagrid prasar ne unhen neeche jameen par eagled
 vah handlebars par kadi khinchaa use maar se bachane ke liye brake ke liye groped, lekin ek garjanapurna ke saath, bhoomi durghatana kaanp, vah ek ganda talab main maar daalaa

 'sadakah or Sadak' refers to "voluntary donations" in the modern context
 quran ke anusaar, shabd svaichhik bhent kaa arth he, jiskaa dhan "daata" kii ichha par he
 According to Arabic terminology, words derived from the root sa daqa cover "many meanings associated with ideas of righteousness and truth"
 quran main, sambandhit shabd kaa prayog "naitik utkrushtataa", jaise ki al siddiq, jo ki bhavishyadvaktaa yusuf, yaa sadik ke varnan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Modern research, on the other hand, try to ethically link the word linguistically to the Hebrew Anudana sedaka
 kuch visheshgy isliye nishkarsh nikaalte hai ki shabd sadaaka ek duusari bhashaa se liya gaya shabd he
 According to the Quran, Sadaq leads in purification of those who provide
 quran kaa kahana he ki sadhaaka ko kisi bhautik rup main nahin hona chahie or yah "svaichhik prayaas" yaa ek prakaar kaa shabd ho saktaa he
 This is in agreement with a statement, given to Muhammad, stating, "every good deed is a form of Sadak
 " quran ke drushtikon se, "apmaan" ke saath achche shabdon or "dayaa" sadaaka se behatar he, or unke dwaara sweekaar kiye jane ke liye janata main ise karne kii bajaay daan ke liye "budhimaani" kii peshkash karne ke liye behatar he quran "daanavpurn saarvajanik vyavhaar" ke dwaara udaar yaa sadak ke mulya ke saath samjhauta karne ke uddeshy se daan karne kii aalochana bhi karata he, "keval saamaanya rup se dharmarth kaary vishuddh rup se swayanseva karte hue
 "the Qur'an suggests that Sadaka is not only meant to support the poor, but can also be donated to those who" did not see need "and who needed help to extend their lives or Who should be directed towards new jobs and "economic opportunities"
 kuch hadison ke anusaar, "ek prakaar kaa shabd or muskuraahat" ko sadaq mana ja saktaa he or iskaa sabase acha rup "gyaan par guzar rahaa he
 "furthermore, Muhammad said in the hadith that Sadaka removes seventy doors of evil
 kuch avasaron par shabd kaa prayog zakaat or nafaaka ke saath kiya jaataa he, haalanki, jabaki jakaat anivaary he, sadakada aamtaur par svaichhik daan kaa sandarbh detaa he

 bengal vibhaajan ke nirnay kii ghoshnaa 19 july 1905 ko bharat ke tatkaaleen visarai lard karjan dwaara kii gayi thi
 It was decided to divide Bengal of India into two parts for the purpose of creating a Muslim majority province
 vibhaajan 16 oktober 1905 se prabhavi hua
 In history it is also known as Bangabhang
 yah angrejon kii "foot daalo - raaj karo" vaali niti kaa hi ek ang tha
 Therefore, in 1908 AD, the 'bang-bhang' movement started in protest against it
 is vibhaajan ke kaaran utpann ucch stareey raajnneetik ashaanti ke kaaran 1911 main dono taraf kii bhartiya janata ke dabaav kii vajah se bengal ke purvi evam pashchimi hisse punah ek ho gaye
 The area of bengal province was 489,500 square kilometers and the population was more than 8 crore
 purvi bengal bhugolic rup se evam kam sanchaar sadhano ke kaaran pashchimi bengal se lagbhag alag-thalag tha
 In 1836, the Upper Provinces were brought under the rule of a Lieutenant Governor and in 1854 the Governor general-in-council was relieved of the direct administration of Bengal
 alag chif-kamishnarship banane ke liye 1874 main assam ko silahat sahit, bengal se alag kar diya gaya or baad main 1898 main lushai hills ko bhi isamen shaamil kar diya gaya
 It was very difficult to manage a large and so populous province like Bengal
 sarvapratham 1903 main bengal ke vibhaajan ke bare main sochaa gaya
 Additional proposals were also made to merge the districts of Chittagang and Dhaka and Mamansingh with Bengal and Assam
 isi prakaar chota nagpur ko bhi kendriya praant se milaayaa janaa tha
 The 19th session of the Congress was also held in Madras in 1903
 usee avasar par uske sabhapati shri lalamohan ghosh ne apane abhibhaashan main sarkaar kii pratikriyaavaadi niti kii aalochana karte hue ek akhil bhartiya manchapar asann vangbhang kii soochna di
 He said that such a conspiracy is going on
 sarkaar ne aadhikarik taur par 1904 kii janvari main yah vichaar prakashit kiya or farvari main lord karzan ne bengal ke purvi jilon main vibhaajan par janata kii raay kaa akalan karne ke liye adhikarik daure kiye
 He consulted with prominent personalities and made speeches in Dhaka, Chittagong and Mamansingh to try to explain the government's stand on partition
 henry jon stedman coton, jo ki 1896 se 1902 ke bich assam ke mukhya ayukta the, ne is vichaar kaa virodh kiya
 Speaking from the post of Chairman in the next session of Congress, Sir Henry Cotton also said that if there is an excuse that such a large province cannot be handled by a governor, then either the governing council of Bengal, like Bombay and Madras, will be in the vicinity of the Governor or Bengali
 Speakers should be separated and made a province
 un dinon bengal praant main bihar or urisa bhi shaamil the
 But the British government neither cared for Congress nor did it hold public opinion
 us samay ke vysarai or governor general lard karjan ne land holders association yaa jameendaar sabha main logon ko yah samajhane kii cheshtaa kii ki vangbhang se laabh hi hoga
 He himself went to East Bengal too, but none other than a handful of Muslims supported this proposal
 musalamaanon main pratishthit dhaka ke tatkaaleen nawab ne bhi pratham aavesh main iskaa virodh kiya tha
 Bengal was partitioned in 1905 on 16 October by Lord Curzon, the then Voice Rai of India
 vibhaajan ko prashaskeey kaaryon ke liye protsaahit kiya gaya, bengal lagbhag france jitna bada tha jabaki uski aabaadi france se kahin adhik thi
 It was thought that the eastern region was neglected and not properly governed
 praant ke bantwaare se poorviy kshetra main behatar prashasan sthapit kiya ja saktaa tha jisase antat vahaan kii janata skool or rojgaar ke maukon se labhanvit hoti
 However, other motives were also hidden behind the plan of partition
 bengali hindu, shashan main adhik se adhik bhagidaari ke liye rajnatik andolan main agrani the, atah ab purv main muslimon kaa varchasv badhane se unki sthiti kamjor ho rahi thi| hindu or muslim dono hi ne vibhaajan kaa virodh kiya| vibhaajan ke baad, haalaanki, lagbhag rashtriya str par british virdohi andolan prabal hua jisamen ki ahimsak or hinsak virodh pradarshan, bahishkaar or yahan tak ki pashchim bengal ke nae praant ke rajyapal kii hatya kaa prayaas bhi shaamil tha
 On 20 July 1905 Vangabhang's proposal was struck down by the Secretary of India, despite strong public opposition
 rajshahi, dhaka tathaa chatagaanv kamishnariyon ko assam ke saath milakar ek praant banaaya gaya, jiskaa naam purvavang or assam rakhaa gaya or baaki hissaa yani presidensi or vardhaman kamishnariyaan bihar, ud or iskaa koi aadhaar tha
 On this occasion, Hindus and Muslims were tried to fight, saying that this division would benefit the Muslims as they would have a majority in the East and Assam
 dhaka ke nawab ne pehle virodh kiya tha, par jab vangbhang ho gaya to vah uske paksh main ho gaye
 Sir Joseph Bamfield Fuller became the former and the new Lieutenant Governor of Assam
 kaha jaataa he, unhone kai jagah khullamakhulla kaha ki hindu or musalmaan unki do bibiyaan hai, inamen se musalmaan unki chaheti hai
 The meaning of this statement was clear
 vangbhang kaa uddeshy prashasan kii suvidha utpann karnaa nahin tha, jaisaa daawa kiya gaya tha, balki iske do spasht uddeshy the, ek hindu musalmaan ko ladaana or duusare navjaagrath bengal ko chot pahunchaana
 If seen in depth, it was the seed planting of Pakistan from here
 muslim lig ke 1906 ke adhiveshan main jo prastaav paas hue, unamem se ek yah bhi tha ki vangbhang musalamaanon ke liye acha he or jo log iske viruddh andolan karte hai, ve galat kaam karte hai or ve musalamaanon ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Later, in the 1908 session of the League, it was also passed that the proposal of the Congress to oppose Vangabhang was not worthy of acceptance
 nae praant main pahari rajya tripura, chittagong mandal, dhaka or rajshahi shaamil hue or malda jile ko assam praant main mila diya gaya
 Bengal not only had to leave these large eastern states, but also five Hindi-speaking states had to be lost to the Central province
 pashchim kii taraf se ise madhya praant se sambalpur or paanch chote oriya-bhashi rajya pradaan kiye gaye
 Bengal had an area of 141,580 square miles and a population of five crore forty lakhs, of which four crore twenty lakhs were Hindus and ninety million Muslims
 nae praant kaa naam kramshah purvi bengal or assam tha jisamen purvi bengal kii rajdhani dhaka or assam kaa adhinsth mukhyalay chittagong tha
 Its area was 106,540 square miles and the population was thirty million, of which one crore eight million Muslims and one crore twenty lakh Hindus
 prashasan ke liye vahaan ek vidhaan parishad tathaa ek dwi-sadasyeey rajasav board tha or kalakatta ucch nyaayalay ke adhikaar-kshetra ko badla nahin gaya tha
 The government pointed out that there would be a properly defined western border between East Bengal and Assam and would have well-defined geographical, necrological, linguistic and social features
 bharat sarkaar ne apana antim nirnay 19 july 1905 ke sweekrut prastaav se prachaarit kiya or bengal kaa vibhaajan usee varsh 16 oktober se lagu ho gaya
 Before its abolition in 1911, the division lasted barely half a decade
 haalaanki bantwaare ke peeche britain kii niti divide at impera thi, jo ki punarsangathit praant ko prabhavit karti rahi
 In 1919, separate electoral system was established for Muslims and Hindus
 is se pehle, donon samudaayon ke kai sadasyon ne sabhi bengaaliyon ke liye rashtriya ekta kii vakaalat kii thi
 Now, individual communities developed their own political issues
 muslimon ne bhi apni samgr sankhyatmak shakti ke bal par, jo ki mote taur par do karod bees lakh se do karod assi lakh ke bich thi, vidhanmandal main varchasv hasil kiya
 The demand for the creation of two independent states for Hindus and Muslims at the national level began to arise, with most Bengali Hindus now favoring the partition of Bengal on the basis of Hindu majority area and Muslim majority area
 muslim ab puure praant ko muslim rajya, pakistan kaa hissaa bananaa chaahate the
 Bengal split for the second time in 1947, this time on religious grounds
 yah purvi pakistan ban gaya
 However, after a successful liberation war with Western Pakistani military rule in 1971, East Pakistan became an independent state called Bangladesh
 bengal ke donon vibhaajanon main raktapaat hua
 This created a major political crisis

 Actually tobacco is a sweet poison, a slow poison
 It takes a man's life slowly
 sarkaar ko bhi shaayad yah pataa nahin ki tambaaku se vah rajasav praapt kerani he, yah baat to sahi he kintu yah bhi sahi he ki tambaaku se utpann rogon ke ilaaj par jitna kharch kiya jaataa he, yah rajasav usase kahin kam he
 The biggest thing is that the consumption of tobacco also causes loss of biographical power
 vyakti ko pataa chal jaataa he ki tambaaku kaa seven hanikaarak he kintu baad main lakh chhudaane par bhi yah lat chhootati nahin
 So gradually the biographical power in him also decreases and he even surrenders himself to destruction in a way
 yah sarvavidit he ki puure sansar main tambaaku kaa durupyog cigarette ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It is also used in India in other forms
 jaise bidi, hukka, gul, gudaku, zarda, kimam, kheni, gutkha aadi ke rup main
 Tobacco should be used in any form, it causes side effects on the body
 bharat main istemaal kiye jane vaale tambaaku kai prakaar ke hote he:- When tobacco is used as gul, gudaku, or khaini, it can cause many diseases in the mouth
 safed daag, munh kaa nahin khul paanaa, tathaa cancer rog bhi ho saktaa he
 Beedi-cigarette smoking has widespread effects in the body
 iske kaaran hriday ke dhamniyon main rakt pravaah kam ho saktaa he
 Heart diseases such as myocardial infarction and anemia may occur
 raktchaap bad saktaa he
 Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, asthma, and lung cancer can occur
 iske atirikt iskaa prabhaav sharir ke snayutantr main padataa he
 It has many other disadvantages
 kishoravastha main utsukata vash yaa mitron ke saath in padaartho kaa seven shuru hota he phir iske nasha kaa anand aane lagata he
 Its quantity is increased
 jo log baar-baar log iskaa seven karte he, unka sharir is maadak padaarth kaa aadi ho jaataa he or phir vah usko chhod nahin pate
 Quitting causes many symptoms such as restlessness, nervousness
 is kaaran log iske aadi ho jate he, usee prakaar jaise log sharaab yaa anya padaarthon ke aadi ho jate he or jab koi kisi padaarth kaa aadi ho jaae to uskaa niyamit seven uski baadhyataa ho jaati he
 Cigarette smokers are not only causing physical harm to themselves by cigarettes but also indirectly causing tobacco poisoning in family and children
 yah sab jaanate hue bhi vah inkaa seven band nahi kar pate
 Whenever they stop consuming it, they feel so uneasy that they start consuming them again
 iske liye aavashyakta he ki vyakti khud ko taiyaar kare ki vah ek nishchit din se dhumrapan karnaa band kar degaa
 Announce it to the whole family
 nishchit din ke pehle ghar se cigarette paauch, ashtray, aadi dhumrapan vastuon ko phenk de
 Stop smoking on a certain day
 yadi dhumrapan karne kii ichha ho to apane ko santvawna de
 Drink more and more water
 aisa karke aap dhumrapan karnaa chhod sakate hai
 a lot of it depends on your will power
 kheni, zarda khaanaa yaa gul, gudaku kaa adhik prayog kisi bhi tarah dhumrapan ke upyog se alag nahi he
 If one wants to give up these substances, then he can prepare himself and get rid of the habits of these substances by willpower
 jab koi vyakti chaah kar bhi tambaaku tathaa usase sambandhit maadak padaarth band nahi kar paye or yadi vah is vishay main bahut gambhir he to iske liye si

 The number of letters is not followed rigorously, rather, it would be correct to say that the number of letters can be less as per the convenience of pronunciation

 yah ek aadhunik rajnatik evam samvidhani siddhanth he
 There are basically two proposals for secularism: 1) Religion should not interfere in the operation and policy-making of the state
 2) sabhi dharm ke log kanoon, samvidhan evam sarkari niti ke aage samaan he
 The term secularism was first used by George Jacob Holliak of Birmingham during 1846 to show ways of improving human life through experience
 unke anusaar, “aastikta-naastikta or dharm granthon main uljhe bagaiyr manushya maatr ke shaareerik, maansik, charitrik, bauddhik swabhaav ko ucchtam sambhavit bindu tak viksit karne ke liye pratipaadit gyaan or seva hi dharmanirpekshata he”
 In secular countries, there are various constitutional benefits to maintain secularism

 The chemical elements in the periodic table are arranged in increasing order of atomic number and are classified into periodic, primary group, secondary group
 vartmaan aavart sarini main 118 gyaat tatv sammilit hai
 The first Russian chemist Mendeleeff introduced the periodic rule in 1869 and presented the elements as a table
 iske kuch maheenon baad german vaigyanik lother meyar ne bhi swatantra rup se aavart sarini kaa nirmaan kiya
 Alfred Werner created the current form of the periodic table from Mendeleev's table
 san 1952 main costa rika ke vaigyanik gil chaveri ne aavart sarini kaa ek nayaa rup prastut kiya jo tatwon ke electranik sanrachana par aadhaarit tha
 The periodic table is very important and useful for chemists
 iske kaaran kam tatwon ke gundharmon ko hi yaad rakhane se kaam chal jaataa he kyonki aavart sarini main kisi samooh yaa kisi aavart main gundharm ek nishchit kram se evam tarksmmat tareeke se badalte hai
 The modern form of the periodic table is shown below, which consists of 18 squares and 7 periods
 aavart sarini ke is prachlit prabandh main lanthanide or actenide ko anya dhaatuon se alag rakhaa gaya he
 F-block and g-block metals are also managed together in detailed and very detailed periodic tables
 aavart sarini main tattvon kii shreniyan Sorting in incremental order of atomic weights of elements yield horizontal rows called 'periodic'
 aavart niyam ke anusaar tatwon ko parmaanu bhaar ke vruddhi kram main kshaitij kataron main sajaane par saaman gun vaale tatv ek hi urdhvadhar kalam main upasthit rahete hai, inhen 'varg' kehete hai
 The upward lines of the periodic table are called 'groups' or 'squares'
 tatwon ke vargeekaran kii drushti se samoohon ko sabase mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 In some groups, the elements show similar properties
 in samoohon ke naam kshareey tatv, kshareey parthiv dhaatu, hellogen, nictogen, chalcogen or akriy gas
 The horizontal lines of the periodic table are called periodic
 haalanki tatwon ke vargeekaran main samooh adhik mahatvapurn maane jate hai, phir aavart sarini main kai sthal aise hote hai jahaan aavart kaa mahatv adhik ho jaataa he
 D-blocks or transition metals and F-blocks can be taken as an example
 aadhunik aavart sarini ko aavart sarini kaa deergh rup bhi kehete hai
 It has 18 squares and 7 periods
 kisi ek varg ke sabhi tattvon ke parmaanuon ke sabase bahari kaksha main electranon kii sankhya samaan hoti he
 Because of this, all the elements of a single class have the same main properties
 sanyojak electranon ke aadhaar par tatwon ko 4 khandon main baanta gaya he- s, p, d, f 
 The first Russian chemist Mendeleeff introduced the periodic rule in 1869 and presented the elements as a table
 iske anusaar, That is, if the elements are kept in atomic weight increments, then the elements whose properties are same come after a certain period
 mendleve ne is sarini ke sahare tatwon ke bhautik evam rasinic gunon ke aavarti hone ke pahalu ko pradarshit karne kaa praytn kiya
 There were a total of 8 squares in Mandleaf's periodic table because inert gases were not discovered at that time
 baad main niskriy gaison kii khoj ke pashchaat aadhunik aavart sarini main 9wein varg ko sammilit kiya gaya
 This 9th class is called 0
 varg ek se aathven varg ko roman akshar I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII tathaa VIII dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 The ninth class is represented by 0

 He eliminated the categories present in Mendelive's periodic table and increased the number of classes from 9 to 18
 iske baad bhi hydrogen kaa do sthanon par hona or lenthenid or actinide tatwon ko sarini main sthaan na hona do mukhya dosha ab tak hai
 a few months after Medleaf introduced the periodic table, German scientist Lothar Meyer also independently created the periodic table
 1815 se 1913 tak isamen bahut se sudhaar hue taaki naye avishkrut tatwon ko uchit sthaan diya ja sake or sarini nayi jaankariyon ke anuroop ho
