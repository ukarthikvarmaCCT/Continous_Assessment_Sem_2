 Justine was the first ruler of the Byzantine Empire from 527 to 565
 use 'justinian mahaan' or 'sant justinian' bhi kehete hai
 The Emperor Jastinian was born on May 11, 483
 iskaa pehla naam 'uprada' tha, parantu kustuntuniyaan main shiksha praapt karne or uske chachaa justin dwaara use god liye jane ke pashchaat usne apana naam badal kar justinian kar liya
 After his uncle's death in 527, he ascended the throne and ruled until his death in 565
 shasnarud hone ke baad justinian ne apana dhyaan antarrashtriya maamalon par lagaaya
 His army had to fight many wars from abroad
 san 529 se lekar 532 tak faras ke saath uskaa yuddh hota rahaa
 In these wars, his commander, Bolisarius, had significant successes, but these successes did not bring any special benefit to the Justians
 usne faras ke saath sangharsh se bachane ke liye usase shantisandhi kar lee or use vaarshik rup se ek nishchit dhanrashi dene laga
 After conquering Bolisarius bundles in 533, he reached Italy via Sicily and annexed it into the empire
 parantu apni sainik durbalata ke kaaran justinian italy par sthaayee prabhutv nahin sthapit kar sakaa
 His attempt to conquer Spain too was not successful
 uske shashan kaal main denube tat kii barbar jatiyaan bhi uske liye sir dard bani raheen
 In 559, he was also forced to call retired Bolisarius to protect Kustuntunia

 In the end, the Justians ordered a textbook of 'roman La' and a treatise called 'institutes'
 baad main in sabko milakar das khandon kaa prasiddh 'carpus juris civilas' prakashit kiya gaya
 This is the main source of Roman law
 justinian kii mahanata ke sambandh main koi andeh nahin lekin yah tathy bhulaayaa nahin ja saktaa ki use bahut hi yogya sahaayakon kaa sahyog praapt tha
 Belisarius was the Chief of the Army Staff and a qualified Tribonian judge
 iske atirikt rajkumaari thiodos ne uske shashan main sakriy ruchi lekar usamen haath bantaya
 The sanctity of the character of the Justians and his ethics are evident in the belief that he believed in theology and tried hard to remove religious hypocrisy

 However, more controversial were those provisions as to how the water would be distributed, it had to be decided
 kyonki pakistan ke niyantran vaali nadiyon kaa pravaah pehle bharat se hokar aata he, sandhi ke anusaar bharat ko unka upyog sinchai, parivahan or bijli utpaadan hetu karne kii anumati he

 purvi nadiyon ke pani ke nuksaan ke liye pakistan ko muaavja bhi diya gaya
 After the end of the 10-year moratorium, from 31 March 1970, India got full rights to the full use of the waters of its allotted three rivers

 Progress in these areas will lead to a sense of community between the two countries which may, in time, lead to the settlement of a Kashmir
 Accordingly, i have proposed that a program of work outside India and Pakistan to jointly develop and jointly operate the Indus Basin river system, on which both countries depended, for irrigation water
 With new dams and irrigation canals, additional water can be used in the Indus and its tributaries to produce the necessary increased food production for each country
 i suggested in the article that the World Bank might use the parties to bring to their good offices the agreement, and help finance an Indus Development Program

 In correspondence with them the leaders of India and Pakistan, Black stated that the Indus dispute could be resolved most realistically, if there were disagreements about functional aspects, apart from political reasons
 They have imagined that a group has tried to surround the best use of the question of how to leave the Indus basin of water, the historical right or allocation of questions on one side

 Finally, in 1954, after nearly two years of negotiations, the World Bank offered its own proposal, stepping beyond the limited role it was apportioned to itself and forcing both sides to consider concrete plans for the future
 Basin for
 The proposal offered three basins of India's eastern tributaries and three western tributaries of Pakistan

 While the Indian side was liable to the World Bank's proposal, Pakistan found it unacceptable
 vishwa bank aavantit purvi nadiyon ke liye bharat or pashchimi nadiyon pakistan ke liye
 This new distribution did not account for the historical use of the Indus basin, or the fact that the eastern districts of West Punjab could change the desert and Pata conditions of Pakistan's interaction

 The water resources of India are very important for the economy here because a large population of India is dependent on agriculture and Indian agriculture is largely dependent on rainwater

 There is a lot of rainfall in India, but this rainfall does not equal in the twelve months of the year but occurs in a particular season, due to which a lot of rainwater flows without any use

 The availability of water resources in India is associated with lifestyle and culture at the regional level

 According to a study conducted in 2008, the total water availability in the country was 654 billion cubic meters and the then total demand was 634 billion cubic meters
 
 Also, it has been clarified in several studies that in the near future, the difference between demand and supply may take worrisome form if the distribution on regional basis is also included and the problem will increase

 Along with this, if we look at the short term water crisis in terms of regional diversity, then we also find that even around the most rainy place like Cherrapunji, since the soil does not hold water for a very long time and rainfall occurs in a specific season, the short term water crisis stands up

 Psychosis or schizophrenia is a mental disorder
 isaki visheshtaayen hai- asaamaanya saamaajik vyavhaar tathaa vaastavik ko pahchaan paane main asamarthta
 This disorder is found in about 1% of people
 is rog main rogi ke vichaar, samveg tathaa vyavhaar main asaamanya badlaav aa jate hai jinke kaaran vah kuch samay liye apni jimmedaariyon tathaa apni dekhbhaal karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Both 'psychosis' and 'schizophrenia' literally mean 'breakdown of mind'
 sizophrenia ke kuch pramukh lakshan hai, jaise ki shuruuaat main :- It is not necessary that all these symptoms are seen in every patient, so if any of these symptoms are seen in any person, then he should seek psychiatric advice immediately
 schizophrenia kisi bhi jati, varg, dharm, ling, yaa umr ke vyakti ko ho saktaa he
 Like other diseases, the disease can also be inherited from close family members, so it is more likely to occur in the patient's children, or siblings
 atyadhik tanaav, saamaajik dabaav tathaa pareshaaniyaan bhi beemaari ko banaaye rakhane yaa thik na hone dene kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Chemical changes in the brain or sometimes any brain injury can also cause this disease
 neeche die vyavhaarik badlaav rogi ko bigadati avasthaa ke sanket ho sakate hai :- If you feel that a person has these symptoms: - in anaavashyak prabhaavon ke hone par dawa kaa seven roke nahin kyonki yah prabhaav samay ke saath apane aap hi kam ho jate hai tathaa inako rokane ke liye saamaanya si saavdhaaniyaan bhi rakhi ja sakati hai, jaise :- The patient of schizophrenia can lead a perfectly normal life after taking the medication after the main symptoms go away
 vah apni kshamta ke anusaar naukari kar saktaa he, pard saktaa he, dost bana saktaa he tathaa apane sabhi sapane puure kar saktaa he
 a schizophrenia patient can marry after symptom-free, but he has to take care that the new changes in his life do not affect his sleep and medication
 yadi rogi stri hai to vah bina chikitsakeey salaah ke garbh dhaaran na karen
 In children with schizophrenia, the disease can be inherited, but it is not always necessary
 schizophrenia grasit koi vyakti shravan sambandhi vibhram, mithyabhram or asangathit tathaa aswabhaavik soch evam bhashaa pradarshit kar saktaa he; yah vichaar kii shrinkhalaa or vishay pravaah main nuksaan, jisamen vaakya arth kii drushti se keval aspasht rup se sambandhit hote hai, se lekar gambhir maamalon main asambandhata, jise shabd kaa salad kaha jaataa he, tak ho saktaa he
 Social segregation usually arises for various reasons
 saamaajik bodh main kshati sizophrenia se usee prakaar se sambandhit he, jis prakaar mithyabhram or vibhram se pairanoiya ke lakshan or evolision ke nakaaratmak lakshan sambandhit hai
 In an unusual subsystem, may remain stationary in the odd posture, or may display aimless stimuli; These are all symptoms of catatonia
 koi ek lakshan sizophrenia ke nidaan se sambandhit nahin he or sabhi anya chikitsa or maansik sthitiyon main ho sakate hai
 The current classification of psychiatrists assumes that disease symptoms must be present for at least one month over a period of at least six months of disturbed activity
 choti avadhi kii sizophrenia jaisi manovikruti ko chizophrenia rupi vikruti kaha jaataa he
 Late adolescence and early adulthood are the peak times of onset of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia kaa upachaar kiye jane vaale 40% purushon or 23% mahilaon main, yah sthiti 19 varsh kii umr se pehle utpann hui
 These are very important periods in the social and professional development of a young adult and can be severely hampered
 sizophrenia ke prabhaav ko kam se kam karne ke liye, beemaari ke praarambhik charan kii pahchaan karne or uskaa upachaar karne ke liye haal hi main paryaapt kaary kiye gaye hai, jiskaa pataa rog lakshanon ke shuru hone ke pehle 30 maheenon tak lagaaya gaya he, lekin ve adhik lambey samay tak upasthit rah sakate hai
 People who develop schizophrenia experience non-specific symptoms of social breakdown, irritability and restlessness in the early period, and transient or auto-limiting psychosis related symptoms in the early stages before the psychosis becomes apparent
 Can
 manochikitsak kurt shenidar ne manorog sambandhi lakshanon ke roopon ko soochibaddh kiya jise unhone mana ki ve schizophrenia ko anya manorog sambandhi vikaron se bhinn karte the
 These are called first-class signs or first-class symptoms of shenider and they include false illusions in the category of being controlled by an external force; The belief that thoughts are being put into one's conscious mind or withdrawn from it; The belief that the views of one person are being transmitted to other people; And listening for confused voices that comment on a person's thoughts or activities or have a conversation with other confused voices
 haalanki unhone vartmaan naidanik mandandon main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he, pratham shrenee ke lakshanon kii vishistataa par prashn uthaaye gaye hai
 a review of clinical studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that these studies allow neither a reaffirmation or rejection of Schneider's claims and suggested that future clinical systems revisions may be the first The emphasis should be on the symptoms of the category
 schizophrenia kaa varnan aksar ek sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak lakshanon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The term positive symptoms signifies symptoms that are not commonly experienced by most individuals but are present in schizophrenia
 unamem mithyaa bhram, shravan sambandhi vibhram or soch sambandhi vikaar shaamil hote hai or unhen vishesh rup se manovikruti kii abhivyakti mana jaataa he
 Negative symptoms are those that are not present in individuals affected by schizophrenia but are typically found in healthy people, that is, symptoms that reflect a loss or loss of general characteristics or abilities

 Research suggests that negative symptoms contribute more to poor quality of life, functional disability, and burden on others than positive symptoms

 a third trait group, disruptive syndrome, is commonly discussed and includes chaotic speech, thoughts, and behavior

 The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made based on the morphology of the symptoms
 tantrika sambandhi sahasambandhi vasteen paryaapt rup se upyogi maandand uplabdh nahin karaati he
 Diagnosis is based on the individual's own experience report and abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends, or co-workers, and subsequently a clinical assessment conducted by a psychiatrist, social worker, clinical psychologist or other mental health professional
 manorog sambandhi moolyankan main ek manorog sambandhi itihaas or maansik sthiti pariksha ke kuch rup shaamil hote hai
 The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia is the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition DSM-IV-TR and World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-10
 Is obtained
 baad ke maandand vishesh rup se europea deshon main prayukt hote hai jabaki DSM maandand sanyukt rajya america or duniya ke baaki hisson main prayukt kiye jate hai or saath hi ve anusandhan sambandhi adhyayanon main prachlit hai
 The ICD-10 criteria emphasize first-class symptoms of Schneiderian, although, in practice, the synergy between the two regimes is very high
 diagnostic and statistical minial of mental disorders ke chaturth sanskaran ke anusaar, sizophrenia kaa nidaan karne ke liye, teen naidanik maandand puure kiye jane chahie: Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of a mental condition or widespread developmental disorder are present, or if the symptoms are the direct result of a common medical condition or a substance, such as alcoholism or its medication

 schizophrenia ] a more general medical and neurological examination is required to rule out a health-related illness that can rarely cause symptoms similar to psychiatric schizophrenia, such as metabolic disturbances, serological infections, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy
 And brain wounds
 It may be necessary to remove unconsciousness, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, rapid attacks and unstable levels of consciousness, and indicates an underlying health disease
 aam taur par jaanch purvavastha prapti ke liye duhraaye nahin jate hai jab tak ki koi vishisht chikitsa sambandhi sanket nahin ho yaa manovikruti rodhi aushadhi kaa koi pratikul prabhaav nahin ho
 Greek σχίζω = "I refute") Despite the etymology of the word, "schizophrenia" does not mean double personality, DSM-IV-TR main schizophrenia ke paanch up-vargeekaran hai
 The ICD-10 defines two additional modalities
 schizophrenia kii vaidhata ko naidanik ikai ke rup main maanane hetu aalochana kii gai he kyonki isamen vaigyanik vaidhata or naidanik vishwasaneeyata kii kami paayi gai he
 In 2006, a group of mental patients and professionals from the UK debated under the flag of a movement to ban the schizophrenia label because it was rejected because clinical studies of schizophrenia were diversity-based and stain-linked and He called for the adoption of a biological-psychosocial model
 britain ke anya manochikitsakon ke samooh ne yah kah kar is prayaas kaa virodh kiya ki ek ek praavdhanik vichaardhaara hone ke baavjood schizophrenia shabd upyogi he
 The class of different types of schizophrenia used in DSM has also been criticized
 anya maansik vikaron ke samaan, kuch manochikitsakon ne suzav diya he ki anya vibhinnataaon ke saath vyaktigat ayaamon ke aadhaar par iske nidaan ko liya janaa chahie, jisase ki vahaan saamaanya or biimaar longon ke bich ek khai ke bajaae ek satatta bana rahe
 This approach seems very meaningful and serious for research on schizophrenia and its relevance to psychological experiences, which are mostly not stressful, and also build a clear trust among ordinary people
 is avlokan ke saath sahmati pragat karte hue manovaigyanik adgar jones or manochikitsak tony david tathaa nasir ghaemi ne bhranti par saahitiyon kaa paryvekshan karte hue ingit karte hue kaha ki mithyaa bhram kii paribhaasha kii samarupata or sampoornataa ko paane kii ichha bahut logon kii rahi he, mithyaa bhram na hi kabhi aavashyak rup se sthir hote hai, naa hi yah galat hota he or na hi inamen vartmaan kii niyantran ho sakane vaali ghatnaayen hi shaamil hoti hai
 Nancy Anderson, an emerging researcher in the field of schizophrenia, refutes the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria in her criticism of abandoning its validity for clinical improvement alone
 ve is baat par jor detii hai ki isaki naidanik vishwasaneeyata kaa sudhaar karte samay naidanik maapdandon kii manovikruti par adhik bal dene se iskaa moolbhoot gyaan ko ham baadhit kar dete hai jiskaa moolyankan karnaa prastutikarnon main isaki badi vibhinnata ke kaaran sambhav nahin he
 This ideology has also been considered by other psychiatrists
 isi kram main ming tsang or uske sahyogi is baat par paricharchaa va bahes karte hai ki manovikruti ke lakshan sabhi main saamaanya ho sakate hai bhale hi iske antim str kii vikruti par vibhinnataayen ho sakati hai, jisamen schizophrenia ko shaamil kiya gaya he, bajaae iske ki schizophrenia kii ateology yaa hetuvigyaan ke vishisht vishaleshan par sachet karte hai ki dsam ke sambandh main bahut kam parichaalanaatmak paribhaasha schizophrenia ke nirmaan par "sahi" uplabdh he
 Neuroscientific Michael Foster Green goes further to suggest that the presence of specific mechanisms of cognition impairment can be used to produce phenotypes that are purely symptom-based alternatives
 sah haniyaan baadhita yaa kami ke aadhaar par manovaigyanik gatividhiyon ke rup main parilakshith hoti hai jaise dimag, aakarshan, kaaryon kii kaarywahi or samasya ko suljhaana
 Removing influential factors from schizophrenia criteria, even though this therapeutic system is widespread, has also led to resistance
 DSM main se ise nikaal dene ke parinamswaroop ek "samaj main nahi aane vaale" alag prakaar kii vikruti – sizophreniavikruti ban kar saamne aayi he
 Referring to very weak reliability, some psychiatrists have completely opposed the idea of schizophrenia as a separate entity
 bhav vikruti or schizophrenia ke bich shrenikrut antar ko craayepelinian dishotomi kehete hai, jisane anuvaanshik epidemyology ke aankadon ko bhi chunauti di he
 Because the reliability of diagnostics creates difficulty in the measurement of its associated effects, examples suggest that genetic and environmental factors may play a role in mixers in schizophrenia outcome
 udaahranon se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki schizophrenia ke naidanik upachaar main mahatvapurn kaarak nihit hote hai lekin ve paryaavarniya karkon or tanaav paidaa karne vaale ghatakon ke mahatv ko prabhavit karte hai
 The implicit idea of overpopulation can be extracted biologically in some people and is known as the stress – diathesis model
 yah vichaar ki jeevigyaanik, manovaigyanik or manochikitsakeey tathaa saamaajik kaarak, sabhi mahatvapurn he, ise "biopsicososhal" model ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Generational assessments of schizophrenia have shown that the problem of isolating the effects of genetics and studies of isolated environments have shown that a high degree of heredity is found in it
 yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki schizophrenia visham antarnihit anuvaanshiki ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen vibhinn bade or chote jokhimon ke jeens ke badhane ke saath hote hai
 Some people have suggested that it is necessary to have several genetic and other risk factors, before one is affected by it, but there is no certainty in it either
 Recent studies of the genome wide association for schizophrenia and commonly practiced disorders are largely isolated, but there are still some shortcomings between these two disorders
 anuvaanshik se jude adhyayan metaenalysis ne bahut hi gambhir or thos udhaaharan gun-sutreey kshetra main shankaaon ke badhane par prastut kiya he, jo pratyaksh rup se vikarayukt schizophrenia 1 jin protein se sampark karata he, jo haal hi main zinc pifungar protein 804e main shaamil he
 Which is characterized by the trait 6 HLA region under which schizophrenia has been associated with rare deletions or microscopic mimicry of DNA sequences, and contains disproportionately neuro-signaling and brain development genes

 The most prominent central anthropomorphic dilemma is why schizophrenia occurs, if the disease is due to the associated causes of biological heterogeneity, can this variation not be selected and separated? It is necessary to have a complementary and global feature to maintain a balance between such significant inequalities
 atah anumaanit visheshtaon ke sabhi siddhanton ko amaanya kar diya gaya he yaa ve mahatvaheen sabit hue hai
 The occurrence of contingency factors with early neurovicas also increases the risk of developing schizophrenia later
 ek prakaar ke isi jigyaasu nishkarsh se yah pataa chalaa he ki schizophrenia se prabhavit logon main se zyaadaatar log thand yaa basant ke mausam main janmen the

 Living in urban environments continuously for a long time has also been considered as a risk factor for schizophrenia
 saamaajik asuvidha ko bhi iskaa ek kaarak mana gaya he, jisamen garibi or saamaajik vishmata ke kaaran palaayan, rang yaa nasl bhed, parivaar kaa bikharana, berogari or kamjor rahan-sahan vyavastha aata he
 Childhood experiences of abuse or trauma have also been implicated later in life as a risk factor for the diagnosis of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia ke liye mata-pita kii dekhbhaal ko jimmedaar nahin mana gaya he lekin asahyogaatmak sambandhon kaa tut janaa bhi iske jokhimon ke badhane main sahaayak hota he
 However, in about half of schizophrenia patients, it was found that they used drugs or alcohol, which are difficult to prove the association between drug use and the apparent contingency of schizophrenia
 iske liye aksar istemaal kiye jane vaale do vyakhyaaon main hai "iskaa lagaataar istemaal sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he" or "iskaa lagaataar upyog hi chizophrenia kaa kaaran he" or yah donon baaten sahi hai
 The 2007 metaanalysis estimates that frequent use increases mental impairment based on the amount of the drug, including schizophrenia
 iske bahut hi kam udhaaharan hai jo yah bataate hai ki sharaab kaa seven sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he, yaa yah ki maansik rup se vyakti kisi vishesh dawa kaa chayan apane swayan ke upachaar ke liye kar letaa he, is sambhaavna kaa sahyog karne vaale kuch hi udhaaharan hai ki dawa kaa prayog pratikul maansik str kaa kaaran jaise maansik tanaav, jigyaasa, pareshaani, ubaaupan or akelepan kaa kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Because psychosis itself is highly understood and metaemphatime can result in the presence of cocaine use or cocaine-based psychosis with similar symptoms, even when the user is avoiding it
 manochikitsa virdohi andolan ke taur par jane jane vaale prayaas jo 1960 ke dashak main atyadhik sakriy the, rudhiwaadi medical vichaardhaara kaa virodh karte hai ki sizophrenia ek beemaari he
 Psychiatrist Thomas Sasas insists that the psychopath does not get sick, but that person gets lost in the unconventional thoughts and habits that our society considers inconvenient
 ve kehete hai ki samaaj in parais prakaar biimaar or unki aadaton ko vargeekrut karke unke saath anyaay karata he or unke prati kathorta kaa vyavhaar apane saamaajik niyantran ke adheen karata he
 According to this ideology, 'schizophrenia' does not occur but it is a type of social construction, created by those who distinguish between the normal and the unusual in society
 ssaaj ne manochikitsakeey upachaar ke maamle main apane aap ko kabhi bhi "manochikitsa virdohi" nahin samajha he, lekin ve aisa maanate hai ki vayaskon ke bich paraspar paraamarsh se upachaar prarambh kiya janaa chahie basharte iske ki ise vyakti kii ichha ke viruddh us par thopa jaae
 a set of informal psychiatric systems has been designed for the development and care of schizophrenia
 sangyaan main laae gaye paddhtiyon ko naidanik upachaaron ke jokhimon ke saath chinhit kiya gaya he, visheshkar jab vyakti tanaav yaa vismay kii sthiti main hota he, isaki haniyon par atyadhik dhyaan dena, nishkarshon par ekadam pahunch janaa, aakasmik aropan karnaa, saamaajik or maansik staron ke bare main baadhit yuktikaran karnaa, apane andar kii bhaavana ko kisi bahari strot dwaara vyakt nahin kar paanaa or praarambhik taur par drishy kii samasya kaa hona or isaki ekaagratha se dekhbhaal shaamil he
 Some of the well-known features are global neurocognitive impairment in the brain, attention, attention, problem diagnosis, action or social cognition, while others are associated with a particular case and experience
 "adhardaar prabhaav" ke saman taur par hone ke baavjood haal ke nishkarshon se pataa chalaa he ki kai vyaktiyon main sizophrenia ke dauraan ucch bhavuk pratiuttaron, visheshkar tanavagrast yaa nakaaratmak indrio or aisi vikruti ke samvedansheeltaa lakshanon ke samroop vyapti kaa kaaran bhi banati he
 Some examples suggest that the theme of ambiguous belief and the experience of psychosis may be characterized by a disorder characterized by emotion, and affect the symptoms of how a person interprets their experiences
 isaki haniyon ko dur rakhane ke liye "surakshit aadaton" kaa upyog isaki abhaason ke kram main sahaayak hota he
 Examples of the role of the psychological system come forward on the effect of therapies on the symptoms of schizophrenia
 mastishk kii karypranali main kriyaatmak bhinnataaon ke pareekshan ke liye tantrikeey manovaigyanik jaancho or mastishk pratirupan takneekon jaise fmri or PET dwaara kiye gaye adhyayanon se yah pataa chalaa he ki bhinnataayen adhiktar lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag, hippocampus or canapati ke hisson main paayi jaati hai
 These differences have been linked to neurocognitive cognitive impairments that are often considered insane / psychiatric
 mastishk ke mijolimbik maarg main dopamine kii karypranali par vishesh rup se dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he
 a major reason for doing this is the finding of results from incidental studies that a group of drugs, which block the functioning of dopamine and known as phenothiazines, may reduce psychiatric symptoms
 is avadharana kii pushti is tathy bhi hoti he ki amphetamins, jo dopamine ke straav ko yaati he, sizophrenia kii sthiti main yah manorog ke lakshanon ko bigaad sakati he
 a dominant concept, also known as the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, states that over-activation of D2 receptors causes schizophrenia
 yadhyapi, sabhi manorog pratirodhi prabhaavon main aam, D2 avrodh ke aadhaar par 20 varshon tak yahi mana gaya jab tak ki 1990 ke daa ke madhya main PET or SPET pratirupan ke adhyayanon ne samarthak pramaan nahin die
 This interpretation is now considered to be extremely common, as one of the newer psychiatric resistant treatments is as effective as the old one, but it also affects the functioning of cirrotonin and may possibly have a slightly lower dopamine inhibitory effect
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main neurotransmeter glutamet or NMDA glutamet abhigraahak ke ghataae gaye prabhaav par bhi dhyaan diya gaya he
 This concept is also supported by the unusually low levels of glutamate receptors found in posthumous brain testing of people who were previously treated for schizophrenia 199, as well as the discovery that glutamate inhibitory drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine Can simulate symptoms and cognitive problems associated with these situations
 yah tathy ki glutamet abhigraahak ke kam prabhavali hone kaa matlab he lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag or hippocample kii karypranali kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye janevaale jaanchon kaa sateek naa hona or yah ki glutamet dopamine kii karypranali ko prabhavit karata he, in sabhi ko sizophrenia main bhamil kiya gaya he, jinke chizophrenia main glutamet margon kii bhoomika main ek mahatvapurn madhyasth hone kaa pataa chalata he
 However, in the case of positive symptoms, glutamatergic treatment fails
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main mastishk ke kuch vishesh kshetron kii sanrachana or aakaar main bhinnataaon ke aadhaar par parinaamon main bhinnta dekhi jaati he
 Analysis of MRI studies in 2006 showed that for the first time patients with psychiatric symptoms had decreased overall brain and hippocampal volume, and that ventricular volume had increased, compared to patients with healthy controls
 haalanki, in adhyayanon ke anusaar wolum main ausat badlaav MRI ke tareekon dwaara tay kii gayi maapan seemaa ke najadik he, isliye yah tay karnaa bhosh rah jaataa he ki sizophrenia ek tantrikana prakriya he jo us samay bhaaru hoti he jab iske lakshan dikhaai padate hai, yaa yah ki ise ek aisi tantrikeey vikaas kii prakriya samajhnaa behatar he, jisamen kam umr main hi mastishk kii asaamaanya maatra taiyaar ho jaati he
 The psychoses of the first episode were associated with a significant reduction in psychiatric antidote drugs such as haloperidal, whereas the excessive decrease in gray matter volume was not associated with unusual psychiatric antidepressants such as olanzepine
 gairmanviya primets ke adhyayanon se pataa chalaa ki aadaar manorog pratirodhi dawaaon or asaamaanya manorog pratirodhi dawaaon, donon main grey or white matter main kami paayi gayi
 Analysis of diffusion tensor modeling studies in 2009 revealed two consecutive regions of fractional anisotropy reduction in schizophrenia
 One area was in the left frontal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus to the White Matter tract and the other area was in the temporal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, insula, hippocampus amygdala, temporal, and occipital lobe
 Went across the White Matter tract
 lekhak kaa kahana he ki sizophrenia main white matter tract ke do network prabhavit ho sakate hai, jisase un grey matter kshetron ke 'sampark tut jane' kii sambhaavna rahati he jinase ye jude hote hai
 During fmri studies, a deep correlation between brain default networks and taskpositive networks was observed in schizophrenia patients and may demonstrate a high degree of adaptation to attention to chronological observation and external observation
 adhik virdohi do network ke bich sahasambandh network ke bich atyadhik pratidwandvita pataa chalata he
 There are no reliable measurements for the advanced stages of schizophrenia, although the concomitance of both genetic factors as well as nonadolescent psychoses may provide a better estimate of how later treatment may continue
 aise vyakti jo 'atyadhik jokhimpurna maansik avasthaa' kii shrenee main aate hai, jinamein sizophrenia kii paariwarik prishrubhumi ke sathsath asthaayee yaa swaniyantrit manovikrutiyon ke lakshan bhamil hai, unamem ek vashar ke baad kii paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par ilaaj kii sambhaavna 2040 pratit tak hoti he
 The use of psychiatric treatments and drugs has been found to be far more effective in reducing the likelihood of individuals in the category of 'highly risky' than in patients with fully developed schizophrenia
 haalanki, manorog pratirodhi ilaajon ke dushprabhavon ke sandarbh main, un logon kaa ilaaj kahin adhik vivaadit he, jo kabhi sizophrenia kaa car nahin hue, vishkar disphigaring taradive diskinesia ke lakshanon vaale or durlabh parantu kahin adhik maarak neuroleptic mailinent syndrome vaale rogiyon main

 New medical thinking suggests that even early intervention in psychiatric conditions is a retrograde preventive measure to prevent later episodes and the long-term disability associated with schizophrenia
 is rog se mukti kii avadharana abhi tak vivaadit he, kyonki isaki paribhaasha par koi ekamat nahin he, haalanki lakshno ko dur karne ke liye kuch upaay haal hi main sujhaaye gaye hai
 Effective treatment of schizophrenia is often considered to be dependent on standard methods, one of the most common methods being the measurement of positive and negative symptoms
 lakshno kaa prabandhan or kaaryakshmata ko uyana, rogamukti kii tulana main kahin adhik prabhavi mana jaataa he
 Its treatment was discovered in the mid-1950s with the development and presentation of chlorpromazine
 iske liye dhire-dhire ek recovery model ko apanaaya gaya, jisamen ummiido ko tane, saktikaran or saamaajik manyata par jor diya gaya
 Severe schizophrenia conditions may require hospitalization
 yah svaichhik yaa anaichhik bhi ho saktaa he
 Due to changes in the recruitment process, it is no longer common for this to remain in the hospital for a long time, although it may need to be done
 aspataal main bhartee karne ke baad, uplabdh sahaayak sevaaon main kedron par pahunchnaa, saamudayik maansik swasthya dal ke sadsy kaa ghar aakar dekhnaa, yaa sahyogi saamudayik upachaar dalon, sahyogi karmchaariyon or roginiyantrit sahaayta samoohon ko isamen bhamil kiya ja saktaa he
 There is a belief among many non-western communities that schizophrenia can only be treated in more informal, community-controlled ways

 Many practitioners and researchers suspect that differences in respective levels of social engagement and acceptance are one of the reasons, however, that cultural studies are still needed to explain these results

 New and unusual anti-psychotic drugs are commonly used for chronic abnormal psychosis, but they are expensive and are prone to weight gain and obesity-related diseases
 san 2008 main, yues nashnal institute of mental health dwaara kiye gaye aakasmik pareekshan ke parinaamon main ye paaya gaya, ki ek pratham peedhee ke pratinidhi swaroop paaya jane vaala manovikruti rodhi, paraphanjin, anek naveen dawaaon ke 18 maah kii maatra kii apeksha adhik prabhaavshaalee va kifayati he
 The most unusual psychotic patient wanted to continue, ie olanzhapine, had risks of weight gain and metabolic disturbances
 chlojhapin un marijon ke liye sabase zyada asarkaari tha jo anya dawaaon par koi pratikriya nahin dete the
 Since its trial did not take patients with Tardive dyskinesia, its effects on these types of people could not be ascertained
 chunki isamen kaaphi kam pashchaat prabhaav saamne aae the jo ki gatishiltaa ko prabhavit kar sakate the, asaamaanya antipsycotics kai varshon se hi sizophrenia ke liye pratham pankti kaa ilaaj rahaa he, jab tak ki kuch dawaaon ko jo ki isi shrenee main the, unhe food and drug administration dwaara chizophrenia se peedit bacchon or kishoron ke liye hanirahit nahin maan liya gaya
 This benefit was definitely given, but with obesity and metabolic rate disturbance due to which its use remained questionable for a long time
 khaskar bacchon or kishoron main sizophrenia hone par unhe davaaiyon ke saath hi paariwarik vyavhaar chikitsa bhi di jaani chaiye
 Current criticisms have rebutted the claim that abnormal antipsychotics have some additional pyramidal postoperative effects, especially if it is taken in small quantities or chosen as an anti-psychosis of low potency
 sizophrenia se peedit mahilaon main asaamaanya manovikruti rodhi istemaal karne par prolactin ilveshan kaa asar dekha gaya he
 It is not yet known whether new antipsychotics reduce the risk of neuroleptic malignant syndromes, a rare but serious and dangerous neurological problem with the side effects of neuroleptic or psychotropic drugs

 For other patients who cannot or do not take regular medicines, long-term depot preparations of antipsychotics will be given every two weeks so that control can be done

 At least one study has suggested that in the long term, some patients can get good health without taking antipsychotics
 sizophrenia ke ilaaj ke liye manovaigyanik ilaaj kii bhi salaah di jaati he parantu isaki sevaayen adhikansh pharmacotherapy par jaakar tik jaati hai kyonki isamen pratipurti va prashikshan kii kami he
 Cognitive behavioral therapy is used for specific symptoms and is used to diagnose other symptoms such as self-esteem, social initiation and insight
 However, the results of prior tests did not reach any conclusion
 chunki ab ye therapy 1990 ke shishav kaal se ab tak kaaphi pragati kar chuki he, haal hi main hue kuch punarnirikshanon se ye maaloom hua he ki CBT kii chikitsa sizophrenia ke psycotic lakshanon par kargar hoti he
 Another type is Cognitive Remediation Therapy, a technique that is sometimes treated with neurocognitive deficiency present in schizophrenia
 neuropsycological punarvaas kii is takanic par aadhaarit purv sakshya iske sangyanatmak prabhaav dikhaate hai, isamen kuch badlaav yatha mastishk sakriyata ko lekar kiye ja sakate hai jinhe fmri dwaara napa ja saktaa he
 There is another method similar to this which is called cognitive enhancement therapy, it shows its effect on social cognition as well as neurocognition
 paariwarik chikitsa jise sizophrenia ke peedit vyakti se sambandhit puure parivaar par lagu kiya jaataa he, iske sakaaratmak parinaam mili hai yadi ise lambey samay tak upyog main laayaa jaae

 Training of social work has produced both positive and negative results
 kuch pareekshanon ne kuch srujanaatmak va khaskar sangeet chikitsa ke bhi sakaaratmak parinaamon ke sanket diye hai
 The Soteria model is also another option in which treatment is done in the hospital itself but with minimal medication use
 ise multiliu therapetic recovery mathed kaha jaataa he, ise iske khojakarta dwaara is prakaar se bataaya gaya he, din ke 24 ghanton main phinomenologic interventions kaa prayog avyavsaayik karmchaariyon dwaara kiya jaataa he, isamen bina kisi neuroleptic dawa ke ilaaj hota he, isamen ek chota, ghar ke jaisaa, shant, madad ke liye tatpar, surakshatmak va sahneeya saamaajik vaataavaran banaaya jaataa he
 Although its search results are limited, it was found in the 2008 results that this program is also effective in treating patients who have schizophrenia in the first and second episodes
 electroconclujiv therapy, ise sabase pehle di jane vaali chikitsa main sthaan nahin diya ja saktaa parantu aisi sthiti main, jab anya chikitsa kii koi pratikriya na ho
 This therapy is more effective when the symptoms of catatonia are also present, and is used according to the UK guide to the NICE whereby it is used only when there are symptoms of catatonia

 No definitive classification of emotions exists, although several classifications have been proposed
 inamen se kuch vargeekaran hai: The related difference between emotion and the consequences of emotion is the main behavioral and emotional expression

 yadi koi bina koi sambandhit abhivyakti ke bhaavana prakat kare to ham maan sakate hai kii bhaawanaaon ke liye abhivyakti kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Neuroscientific research suggests that there is a "magic quarter second" during which the thought can be known before an emotional response is formed
 us pal main, vyakti bhaavana ko niyantrit kar saktaa he
 The James – Lang theory states that experiences of bodily changes result in large-scale emotion sensations
 bhaawanaaon ke prati kriyaatmak drushtikon, se pataa chalata he ki bhavanaaen kisi vishesh kriya ke falswaroop ek vishay ke rup main surakshit rakhane ke liye ubhari hai
 There are some basic and complex categories, where some basic emotions can be converted into somewhat complex emotions
 In a situation, complex emotions can arise due to cultural conditions or alliances associated with basic emotions

 They arranged the eight primary emotions into pairs of four opposite emotions
 kuch log meta imoshans ke astitv ke bare main bhi tark dete hai jo bhaawanaaon ke bare main bhavanaaen hai
 Another meaning of specific emotions is related to their timing

 baad vaali ko ek lambi avadhi kii pravriti ke rup main mana ja saktaa he jisame ek uchit bhaavana kii bajaay keval kisi ke prati lagaav kii bhaavana he 
 bhaavnaatmak ghatnaon or bhaavnaatmak swabhaavon ke bich antar he
 Temperament is also comparable on the basis of character traits in which one's disposition usually varies according to the experience of particular emotions for different objects
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek chidchida vyakti aam taur par dusron kii bajaay jaldi athwa tezi se chidh jaataa he
 Finally, some researchers classify emotions into a general category of 'affective state', where affect / aroused situations also include emotion-related events such as happiness and pain, emotional conditions, mood, mood, and symptoms

 saanchaa:emotion Theories related to emotions carry the ideas of ancient Greece to Plato and Aristotle
 hamen rene descartes, barook spinoja or david hum jaise darshanikon ke kaam ke rup main parishkrut siddhant bhi milte hai
 Later theories related to emotions have resulted from advances in research
 zyaadaatar siddhant alag nahin hai or kai shodhakartaaon ne apane kaam main vibhinn drushtikon shaamil kiye hai
 According to the somatic theory of emotions, the body reacts directly to emotions rather than to essential judgments
 is tarah ke siddhanton kaa pehla aadhunik sanskaran 1880 main wiliam james ne prastut kiya
 The theory lost support in the 20th century, but recently it has gained popularity again as a result of neurological evidence from researchers such as John Cachioppo, Antonio Damasio, Joseph E
 Leidu and Robert E
 Zajonc
 wiliam james ne ek lekh 'whot iz en imoshan?', ke dwaara yah tark diya ki zyaadaatar bhaavnaatmak anubhav shaareerik badlaavon ke kaaran hote hai
 Around this time Danish psychologist Karl Lang also introduced a similar theory, so it is known as the James – Lang theory
 is siddhant or iske tathyon ke anusaar, paristhiti ke badalane se shaareerik badlaav hota he
 As James puts it, "the concept of physical change is emotion"
 James claims that "we feel sad because we cry, angry during a fight, afraid to tremble, and it may happen that, in an apology, we do not cry during anger or fear
" Fight or shiver is siddhant ko prayogon dwaara sabit kiya gaya he, jisame sharir kii sthitiyon main badlaav laa kar vaanchit bhaavana praapt kii jaati he
 This type of experiment has also been used in medicine
 james-lang's theory is often misunderstood because it is contradictory
 zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki bhavanaaen, bhaavana sambandhit kriyaaon ko badhaava detii hai : jaise "main ro rahaa hoon kyonki main udhaas hoon", yaa "main bhaaga kyonki main dar gaya"
 iske vipareet, james-laing kaa siddhant jor detaa he ki ham pehle sthiti ke anusaar pratikriya karte hai or iske baad ham apni kriyaaon ko bhaavnaatmak pratikriya se jodate hai
 In this way, emotions explain and organize our own actions
 james-laing ke siddhant ko ab zyaadaatar chaatro dwaara nakaar diya gaya he
 According to the following statement by Tim Dalgleish: The james-lang theory has remained influential
 Its main contribution is the emphasis it places on the embodiment of emotions, especially the argument that changes in the bodily concomitants of emotions can alter their experienced intensity
 Most contemporary neuroscientists would endorse a modified james-lang view in which bodily feedback modulates the experience of emotion
" a problem with james-lang's theory is that it focuses on the consequences of action, not on the physical effects of emotional experiences
 
 mastishk sanrachana kii tantrikaon kii masping se mili jaankaree se, maanav bhaawanaaon kii neurobiological vyakhya yah he ki bhaavana ek priy yaa apriy sthiti he jostandhari ke mastishk main paidaa hoti he
 If it is compared to reptiles, the development of emotions will be similar to the transformation of normal bone animals into mammals, in which the neurochemical fluctuates according to the level of brain activity, which causes the body to move, mood swings
 And is reflected in the postures
 udhaaharan ke liye, pyaar kii bhaavana ko standhari ke mastishk ke peleocircuit kii abhivyakti mana jaataa he, jisase dekhbhaal, bhojan karaane or sondarya jaisi bhaawanaaon kaa bodh hota he
 Paleosurkits are a means of displaying bodily emotions by nerves that were formed millions of years before the cortical nerve was formed
 isamen pehle se bane hue raste yaa mastishk ke agle hisse, brain stem tathaa meru rajoumein tantrika koshikaon kaa jaal hota he
 They originated even before the ancestors of mammals to control actions, almost around the time of jawless fish
 mana jaataa he ki, standhari ke mastishk ke viksit hone se pehle, jaanwaron kii zindagi, swachaalit, sachet or nappi tuli thi
 The body of reptiles responds to sensory signals of vision, voice, touch, chemistry, gravity, with predetermined body movements and postures
 raat main sakriy hone vaale stanadhariyon ke aagaman ke saath, lagbhag 180 million varsh pehle, gandh ne ek prabhavi tantrika ke rup main drushti kaa sthaan le liya or soonghney vaali tantrika ke madhyam se pratikriya karne ke or raste bane, jo ki mana jaataa he ki aage chal kar stanadhariyon kii bhaawanaaon or bhaavnaatmak yaaddaasht ke rup main viksit hue
 jurassic kaal main, stanadhariyon ne sarisrupon kii tulana main apni soonghney kii kshamta kaa safaltaapurvak upyog kiya - isiilie stanadhariyon ke mastishk kighran tantrika kaa bhaag sarisrupon kii tulana main bada hota he
 These odors slowly became the blueprint of nerves, which later formed the structure of our brain
 mana jaataa he ki bhavanaaen mastishk ke us kshetra kii kaaryashiltaa se sambandhit he jo hamen nirdesh detaa he, hamaare vyavhaar ko prerit karata he or hamaare ird gird hone vaali ghatnaon ke mahatva kii vyakhya karata he
 Important discoveries by Broca, Papez, and mclean suggest that emotions are associated with a group of structures in the middle of the brain called the limbic system, including the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures
 haal hi main hue anusandhanon se pataa chalaa he ki isamen se kuch limbik sanrachanaayen, dusron ke vipareet, bhaawanaaon se us tarah se sidhi nahin judi hai jabaki kuch gaiyr limbik sanrachanaayen adhik mahatv kii pai gayin hai
 There is substantial evidence that the left prefrontal cortex is activated by stimuli that are produced by positive thinking
 yadi aakarshak uttejnaa mastishk ke chuninda hisse ko sakriy kar paae to tark purna dhang se ulta hona chahie, arthath adhik sakaaratmak dhang se nirnay lene ke liye mastishk ke us hisse kii chuninda kriyasheeltaa ko uttejnaa utpann kerani chahie
 iskaa pradarshan madhyam aakarshan vaale uttejk drishyon ke saath kiya gaya tha or baad main iskaa vistaar karke nakaaratmak uttejnaa ko shaamil karke ise doharaaya gaya
 Neurobiological models in the prefrontal cortex revealed two opposite results of emotion
 The valence model predicted that anger, which is a negative emotion, would activate the right prefrontal cortex
 The Direction Model predicted that anger is an attitude sense, so will activate the left prefrontal
 The second model received support
 haalanki abhi bhi kai sawaal anuttarit hai ki prifrantal cortex main drushtikon kii behatar vipareet paribhaasha kya he, dur janaa, bina kisi pratikriya ke, kintu takat tathaa pratirodh yaa bina kisi pratikriya ke niskriy parinaam

 "homeostatic bhavanaaen" sharir kii aantarik avasthaa dwaara utpann zajbaat hai, jo hamaare vyavhaar ko vyavasthit karte hai
 Thirst, hunger, feeling hot or cold, feeling deprived of sleep, a desire to eat salt and a desire for air are all examples of homeostatic feelings; Each of these is a signal given by the physiological system that says "everything is not right
 piyo / khao / chaaya main jaao / kuch garam pahano / so jaao / namakeen tukdaa chato / saans lo
" isamen se kisi bhi pranali kaa santulan kharaab hone par, ham homeostatic bhaavana kaa anubhav karne lagate hai or yah bhaavana hamen vahi karaati he, jo us pranali kaa santulan banaae rakhane ke liye aavashyak he
 Pain is a homeostatic feeling that tells us “everything is not well
 peeche hato or bacho"
 There are some theories that argue that cognitive action - a judgment, evaluation, or thought - is necessary to produce an emotion
 richard loras ke anusaar yah is tathy ko pramanit karne ke liye aavashyak he ki bhaavana kisi chiz ke bare main yaa jaanboojh kar paidaa hoti he
 This type of cognitive activity can be conscious or subconscious and may or may not take the form of a conceptual process
 yahan loras kaa ek prabhaavshaalee siddhant he : bhaavana ek baadha he jo nimna kram main utpann hoti he : 1
) sangyanatmak moolyankan-vyakti us ghatana kaa tarkpurna akalan karata he jo bhaavana ko ingit karti he
 2
 Physiological changes - Cognitive responses result in biological changes, such as increased heartbeat or a response to pituitary adrenal
 3
 Action - The person experiences the emotion and chooses to react
 udhaaharan ke liye: jeni ek saanp dekhati he
 1
) Jenny sees the snake, which makes her scared
 2
) Her heart starts beating hard
 adrellin kaa rakt main pravaah tej ho jaataa he
 3
 Jenny yells and runs away
 loras jor dekar kehete hai ki bhaawanaaon kii gunvattta or tivrata ko sangyanatmak pratikriyaaon dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 These responses form a rescue strategy that forms an emotional response according to changes in the individual and his environment
 bhaawanaaon se sambandhit kuch siddhant ye tark dete hai ki bhaavana ke utpann hone ke liye nirnay, moolyankan yaa vichaaron ke rup main sangyanatmak kriya aavashyak he
 a prominent philosophical lecturer is Robert C
 Solomon
 a second example of this is a theory proposed by Niko Frijda according to which trends occur due to evaluation
 yah suzav bhi diya gaya he ki bhavanaaen aamtaur par soochna ko kriyanvit karne tathaa vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne ke liye shortkat kii tarah prayukt hoti hai
 a new hybrid theory of the somatic and cognitive theory of emotions is the perceptual theory
 yah siddhant is tark main alag he kii shaareerik pratikriyaayein, bhaawanaaon par kendrit hai, tathaapi ye bhaawanaaon kii sarthakata par jor detii he yaa is vichaar par, ki bhavanaaen kisi chiz ke bare main he jaisaa ki sangyanatmak siddhanton dwaara paaya gaya he
 The new claim of this theory is that imagined cognition is unnecessary for this type of meaning
 balki shaareerik parivartan khud ko paristhitiyon ke kisi karanvash kriya main badalane ke kaaran bhaawanaaon kii sarthak saamagree ke hisaab se dhaal lete hai
 In this regard, emotions correspond to the power of the mind, such as sight or touch, which in various ways gives us information about the relationship between the object and the world
 is drushtikon kaa ek parishkrut bachaav darshanik jesi prinz kii pustak gat riyekshanz or manovaigyanik james layerd kii pustak feelings main paaya gaya
 It is a communication theory developed by Howard M
 Wise and Russell Cropanzeno, which focuses on the causes, structures and consequences of emotional experiences
 yah siddhant bataata he ki bhavanaayen ghatnaon dwaara prabhavit or ghatit hoti hai jo parinamswaroop nazariye or vyavhaar ko prabhavit karte hai
 This theoretical framework also emphasizes the time in which a person perceives the experience and what is called an emotional episode - "a sequence of emotional conditions that increases over time and is organized around a core theme
 " is siddhant ko kai shodhakartaaon dwaara bhaavana ko sanchaar ke dwaara behatar dhang se samajhane ke liye prayukt kiya gaya he or is par howard em vaais tathaa danniel je bill dwaara apane lekhonriflaction on afective events theory main samiksha kii he jo 2005 main research on imoshan in orgenigeshns main prakashit hua
 In the Canon Bard theory, Walter Breadford argues in contrast to james-lang's effective theory on the physical facts of emotion in the Canon Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear, and Rage
 jahaan james kaa tark tha ki bhaavnaatmak vyavhaar aksar aage kii or badhata he yaa bhaavana kii vyakhya karata he, canan or board kaa tark tha ki pehle bhavanaaen utpann hoti hai or uske baad vishisht vyavhaar utpann hota he
 Another cognitive theory is the Singer – Shafter theory
 yah prayogon ke abhipraayon par aadhaarit he jo bataata he ki ek hi maansik avasthaa main hone ke baavjood adrenelin ke ek injaikashan dwaara vyaktiyon kii vibhinn bhaavnaatmak pratikriyaayein ho sakati hai
 Individuals were observed expressing anger or happiness in line with the sentiment expressed according to the situation of the other person
 is prakaar, sthiti ke moolyankan or pratibhaagi dwaara adrenelin yaa plasebo lene ke sangyojan ne ekasaath pratikriyaayein nirdhaarit kin
 is prayog kii jesi pinz kii gat riyekshanz main aalochana kii gai he
 a recent version of cognitive theory roughly describes emotions as being at the same time a number of different physiological and cognitive components
 bhavanaaen samgr prakriya dwaara pahachaani jaatin hai jisase kam str kaa sangyanatmak moolyankan, vishesh rup se praasangik prasanskaran main, shaareerik pratikriyaaon, vyavhaar, bhaawanaaon or kriyaaon ko shuru karata he
 Emotions have been worked on in many different disciplines
 maanav vigyaan maansik prakriyaaon main bhaawanaaon kii bhoomika, vikaron or tantrika tantra ke bare main bataata he
 In psychology, emotions are examined in subject-related studies and in the treatment of mental disorders in humans
 manovigyaan bhaawanaaon ko maansik prakiyaayein maanate hue unki ek vaigyanik pariprekshya se jaanch karata he or antarnihit shaareerik or snaivik prakriyaaon kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Scientists in sub-branches of neuroscience, such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, study the nervous system of emotion by linking neuroscience to psychological studies of personality, emotion, and mood
 bhashaa vigyaan main, bhaavana kii abhivyakti dhvaniyon ke arth main badal sakati hai
 In the field of education, the relationship with the emotions of the learning process is being investigated
 saamaajik vigyaan aksar baatcheet maanav samskruti or samjik sahabhaagita main bhaavana kii bhoomika kii jaanch karata he
 In sociology, the role of emotions in human society, social structure and participation and culture is examined

 lekin iske saath hi isane is khatare ko bhi rekhaankit kiya ki bhashaai or saanskrithik asmita kii paribhaasha jitani sankuchit hoti he, duusari bhashaaon or samskritiyon ko anya yaa bahari ghoshit karne kii pravriti majboot hoti chali jaati he
 Assam has a long history of outsiders
 aupniveshik prashasan ne hazaron bihariyon or bengaaliyon ko yahan aakar basane, yahan ke chaay baganon main kaam karne or khaali padi zamin par kheti karne ke liye protsaahit kiya
 At that time, Assam had a very small population
 aise main assam ke bhumipatiyon ne bengali jotdaaron or bihari mazaduron kaa khulkar swaagat kiya
 Between 1939 and 1947, Muslim communal forces also encouraged Bengali Muslims to settle in Assam
 unhen lagata tha ki aisa karne se desh vibhaajan kii sthiti main ve behatar saudebaazi kar sakenge
 After partition, a large number of Bengali people came from newly created East Pakistan to West Bengal and Tripura as well as Assam
 1971 main purvi pakistan main musalmaan bengaaliyon kilaaf pakistani sena kii hinsak karrwai ke kaaran vahaan ke takreeban das lakh logon ne assam main sharan lee
 Most of these returned after the formation of Bangladesh, but around one lakh people remained there
 1971 ke baad bhi bade paimaane par bangladeshiyon kaa assam main aana jari rahaa
 In such a situation, the farmers and natives of Assam started to fear that their property would be taken over by people from Bangladesh
 jansankhya main hone vaale is badlaav ne muulavaasiyon main bhashaai, saanskrithik or raajnneetik asuraksha kii bhaavana paidaa kar di
 This sentimentalized the people of Assam and especially the youth there
 assam ke logon ko lagane laga ki bahari logon, khaas taur par bangladeshiyon ke kaaran ve apane hi rajya main alpsankhyak ban jaayenge jisase rajya kii arthvyavastha or raajnneeti par unki koi pakad nahin rah jaaegi
 This fear of the people was not completely wrong either
 1971 kii janaganana main assam main asamiya bhashaa bolne vaale sirf 59% pratishat hi log the
 It also included many Bengalis who had learned this language due to living here for more than a generation
 inhen kaarnon se 1980 ke dashak main gair-kanoonee bahiraagton ke kilaaf assam main ek zordaar andolan chalaa
 It is noteworthy that this region underwent a special political renaissance in the nineteenth century and especially after independence, which instilled a sense of pride among the people of Assam for their language, culture, literature, folk art and music
 rajya kii saanskrithik, bhashaai or dharmik vividhta ko dekhte hae yah ek jatil prakriya thi
 Many people who have supported the unified Assamese culture have also been of the view that by giving exclusive rights to tribal areas separately or by building separate states like Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, the central government has built a comprehensive Assamese identity
 Has hindered
 isiilie assam ke yuvaaon main centre ke prati ek nakaaratmakataa or aakrosh kii bhaavana rahi he
 From the fifties, outsiders coming to Assam illegally had become a political issue, but in 1979 it came to the fore as a major issue when large number of people coming from Bangladesh were included in the state's voter list
 Has been included 1978 main maangalodi loksabhaa kshetra ke saansad kii mrityu ke baad upachunaav kii ghoshnaa hui
 The election official found that there has been a tremendous increase in the number of voters
 isane sthaneey str par logon main aakrosh paidaa kiya
 It is believed that due to the arrival of outsiders, especially Bangladeshis, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of voters in the region
 ol assam student union or kshetreey raajnneetik, saahitiyik or saanskrithik sanghathanon se milakar bani assam gana sangram parishad ne bahiraagton ke kilaaf andolan ched diya
 Significantly, Asu as a student organization existed since the British era
 us samay uskaa naam tha ahom chaatr sammilan
 But in 1940 the organization split and in 1967 the two factions merged again and the organization was renamed All Assam Students Association
 lekin phir iskaa naam badalakar ol assam student union yaa aasu kar diya gaya
 Hindus, Muslims and many Bengalis speaking Assamese language openly supported the movement launched by Asu
 andolan ke netaaon ne yah daawa kiya ki rajya kii jansankhya kaa 31 se 34 pratishat bhaag baahar se gair-kanoonee rup se aaye logon kaa he
 He asked the Central Government to seal the boundaries here to prevent outsiders from coming to Assam, identify illegal outsiders and remove their names from the voter list and until such time someone in Assam Do not conduct elections
 andolan ne yah maang bhi rakhi ki 1961 ke baad rajya main aane vaale logon ko unke mul rajya main waapas bheja jaae yaa kahin duusari jagah basaaya jaae
 This movement received such strong support that in 1984, elections could not be held in 14 parliamentary constituencies from sixteen parliamentary constituencies
 1979 se 1985 ke bich rajya main raajnneetik asthirataa rahi
 President's rule also came into force
 lagaataar aandolan hote rahe or kai baar in andolanon ne hinsak rup akhriyaar kiya
 a state of unprecedented ethnic violence has arisen in the state
 lambe samay tak samjhauta-vaarta chalane ke baavjood andolan ke netaaon or centre sarkaar ke bich koi sahmati nahin ban saki, kyonki yah bahut hi jatil mudda tha
 It was not easy to decide who is 'outsider' or foreigner and where such people should be sent
 centre sarkaar ne 1983 main assam main vidhansabha chunaav karaane kaa faisalaa kiya
 But organizations associated with the movement boycotted it
 in chunaavon main bahut kam vot daale gayi
 In areas where the Assamese speaking people had a majority, there were less than three percent of the votes
 rajya main adivasee, bhashaai or sampradayik pahachaanon ke naam par jabardast hinsa hui jisamen teen hazaar se bhi zyaada log maare gayi
 The Congress Party government was formed after the elections, but it had no democratic legitimacy
 1983 kii hinsa ke baad donon pakshon main phir se samjhauta-vaarta shuru hui
 On 15 August 1985, an agreement was reached between the Rajiv Gandhi government at the center and the leaders of the movement, known as the Assam Accord
 iske tahat 1951 se 1961 ke bich aaye sabhi logon ko purna naagarikta or vot dene kaa adhikaar dene kaa faisalaa kiya gaya
 Decided that those who came to Assam after 1971 will be sent back
 196 1 se 1971 ke bich aane vaale logon ko vot kaa adhikaar nahin diya gaya, lekin unhen naagarikta ke anya sabhi adhikaar diye gayi
 a package for the economic development of Assam was also announced and it was decided to set up an oil refinery, paper mill and technology institute here
 centre sarkaar ne yah bhi faisalaa kiya ki vah asamiya-bhashi logon ke saanskrithik, saamaajik or bhashaai pahchaan kii suraksha ke liye vishesh kanoon or prashasnic upaay karegi
 Subsequently, the voter list was amended based on this agreement
 vidhansabha ko bhang karke 1985 main hi chunaav karaae gayi, jisamen navgathit assam gana parishad ko bahumat mila
 Party leader Prafulla Kumar Mahant, who was also the president of ASU, became the chief minister
 us samay unki umr keval 32 varsh kii thi
 The Assam Accord brought an end to the long-standing political instability there
 lekin 1985 ke baad bhi yahan ek alag bodo rajya ke liye andolan chalata rahaa
 Similarly, the active, underground and violent movement of ULFA continued with the demand of a separate nation for the Assamese people after separating from India
 assam andolan or assam samjhaute ke anubhav se pataa chalata he ki bahari logon ko gair-kanoonee rup se kahin basane se rokna to aavashyak he, lekin ek baar jo bas gaya use hataanaa ek bahut mushkil kaam he
 Apart from this, the granting of foreign status to people who have settled in the state for the last several generations only on the basis of their religious or linguistic identity encourages a kind of bigotry
 assam andolan ke dauraan bhi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne ise musalamaanon ke kilaaf abhiyaan kaa rang dene kii koshish kii thi
 It is noteworthy that the issue on which the Assam movement started, the issue and the complaints related to it have not been completely resolved yet
 iske alaava assam ke samaaj main duusari pahachaanon ke prati ashishnutaa kii bhaavana badi he
 This has not only happened in the context of 'muslim Bengalis', but also a kind of bigotry has arisen against the demands of tribal people

 Varnika started playing the horn continuously so that the public could see them and the police could find them easily
 According to Varnika, police arrived on time due to which the accused could not kidnap or rape them
 The police arrested Vikas Barala and Ashish at the Housing Board Light Point

 The public criticized the police for trying to suppress the case
 Police then said that they had recovered 5 CCTV footage related to the incident

 a member of the Barala family and BJP worker Kuldeep Barala shared a picture of Varnika and her two colleagues on Facebook, and tried to show that she was drunk at the time of the incident
 Barala deleted this post later, but then posted another picture in which Varnika had a glass of wine in her hand
 Barala claimed that this was a ploy of the opposition to tarnish the image of the BJP leader
 Apart from members of the Barala family, many BJP supporters also criticized Varnika
 BJP spokesperson Shaina NC also posted an old picture of Varnika on Twitter, describing the development as innocent
 The message posted with these pictures claimed that "varnika and her bureaucratic father" were not only acquainted with the two accused but also mingled
