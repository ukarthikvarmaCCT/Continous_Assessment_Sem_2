 Oraon or Uraon is a tribal group in the Chota Nagpur region
 oraanv athwa uraanv naam is samooh ko duusare logon ne diya he
 In their lingua franca, the group describes itself as 'kurukh'
 angareji main 'o' akshar se likhe jane ke kaaran is samooh ke naam kaa uccharan 'oraanv' kiya jaataa he; bihar / chhattisgarh main 'uraanv' naam kaa prachlan adhik he
 The Uraon language belongs to the Dravidian family, which is completely different from the Munda languages of the adivasi tribal groups
 uraanv bhashaa or kannada main anek samtayein hai
 Possibly keeping these in mind, GATE in his 1901 census report had expressed the possibility that Uraons were originally residents of the Karnataka region
 unka anumaan tha ki is samooh ke purvaj pehle karnataka se narmada upatyaka main aae or vahaan se baad main bihar rajya ke son tat ke bhaagon main aakar bas gaye
 In the absence of sufficient evidence, it would not be appropriate to consider this inference as scientific

 prayek gotra apane gotrachihnvaale praani, vriksh athwa padaarth kaa kisi bhi tarah upyog nahin karata
 To harm him in any way is also forbidden by his social rules
 yadi unka gotrachihn koi praani yaa pakshi he to ve na to uskaa shikaar karenge or na uskaa maance khaayenge
 Similarly, if their gotra is a tree, then they will not go under its shadow

 Ian Fleming went one step further and approached producer Sir Alexander Korda to produce a film adaptation of Live and Let Die or Moonraker
 haalanki corda ne shuru main dilchaspee dikhaai, lekin baad main peeche hat gaye
 On 1 October 1959, it was announced that Fleming would write an original film screenplay for Producer Kevin mcclory about Bond's character
 Jack Whitingham also worked on the script, which led to a screenplay titled James Bond, Secret Agent
 However, Alfred Hitchcock and Richard Burton refused to play the roles as director and hero respectively
 Meklory was unable to raise financing for the film and the deal was shattered
 fleming ne is kahani kaa istemaal apane upanyaas thanderbal ke liye kiya
 In 1959, producer Albert R
 Broccoli expressed interest in the adaptation of the Bond novels, but his colleague Irving Allen was not enthusiastic
 1961 main, broccoli ne phir harry saltzman ke saath bhagidaari kii or sabhi bond upanyaason ke film adhikaar ko fleming se kharid liya

 Broccoli and Fleming were convinced of Connery, but accepted it when he was rejected by Patrick mcguhan and dismissed Richard Johnson, James Mason, Rex Harrison, David Niven, Trevor Howard and Broccoli's friend Carrie Grant for him did
 jaisaa ki broccoli ne baad main kaha, "main ek damdaar aadmi chahta tha
 

and put a little bit of glee on that strong Scottish jism and you'll get Fleming's Bond instead of all the tantalizing gays being employed in this act "
 Already the bald Connery wore a wig in all of his Bond films

 The film was the second and final film starring Sylvia Trench, however, she was expected to be a regular bed partner between Bond's campaigns throughout the series
 The violence in the second film was definitely more intense than in the previous film, with the massacre more than double

 By 1961, Fleming's Thunderball novel became the biggest hit in the Bond novel series and was the project that drew Cubby Broccoli back in 1961 to form Bond projects - most of which were owned by Harry Salzmann - but Thunderball was its The notable exception was that year, which was given a storyline that made it a screenwriter and the subject of a legal dispute by Fleming

 Mechlory sued Fleming in a court case, because Fleming used the story and characters of Thunderball without permission
 thanderbal film ke adhikaron ko unhone jeet liya, isliye jab broccoli or saltzman ne thanderbal banaai, to vah mechlori ke saath sah-nirmaan tha 
unke saude ke ek hisse ne yah sunishchit kiya ki mechlori das saal tak thanderbal par koi film nahin bana sakate 
 Barring Connery, there was a fierce rivalry for the leading characters

 After You Only Live Twice and despite the posters promoting "sean Connery is James Bond", Connery announced that it was his last Bond film
 shrunkhlaa ko chhod dene kii nirmaataaon kii koi ichha nahin thi
 Shawn was then replaced by George Lazenbai, who starred in On Her Majesty's Secret Service
 australian model jorge lezenbai, on har megestiz sikret sarvice main nae 007 ban gaye
 Timothy Dalton, who later became Bond, refused: he claimed he was too young for the role
 lezenbai ko abhinay kaa anubhav ek chocolate shrunkhlaa ke vigyaapan se adhik kaa nahin tha
 His screen test was satisfactory and he was offered a contract for seven films
 haalanki, apane agent dwaara aashwast hone ke baad ki sikret agent 1970 ke dashak main puraatan ho jayega, lezenbai ne ek film ke baad shrunkhlaa ko chhod diya
 Lezenbai's reviews were generally encouraging
 kai logon ne mahasoos kiya ki vah shaareerik rup se to aakarshak tha lekin apane kai bhadkeeli poshaak parivartan main murkh lagata tha or apane sanvaadon ko thik se prastut ioen-nirmit bond shrunkhlaa main isi film main ek baar "chauthi diwaar" ke tuutane ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Also happened when Sean Connery hits the audience
 ) shrey naamon se pehle aane vaali jhalak main lezenbai, conary ke bond ke sandarbh main bolte hai: "dis nevar hepand tu da adar phelo" 
 On Her Majesty's Secret Service, an effort was made to depict a continuity with previous Bond films that featured scenes from several previous Bond films during the title sequence
 iske alaava, jab bond apane daftar main apana saamaan pack kar rahaa hota he, to pichley maamalon ke kai smriti chihnon ko dikhaaya jaataa he, jaise ki thanderbal kaa shwaas upkaran, jabaki film ke prishth sangeet main un filmon kii dhunon ko bajaayaa jaataa he
 After Lezenbai turned down Diamonds Are Forever, the makers decided to revert to the Goldfinger formula
 nirdeshak gaay hamiltan ke saath niyamit paatr waapas ek saath aae
 John Gavin was offered the role of Bond but the producers were simultaneously attempting to bring Sean Connery back into the role
 is saude ko moort rup dene ke liye conary ko ek ullekhneey anubandh praapt hua: ek ricard US$1

 Connery admitted, "I was actually called back by bribing
 

lekin isse meraa uddeshy puraa hua 


dubaara james bond kii bhoomika nibhaana abhi bhi sukhad he
 "the original idea was to bring Auric Goldfinger back for the sequel, but was abandoned
 fleming ke upanyaas main, bond, yu onli liv twis main hui apni patni kii hatya kaa badla on har megestiz sikret sarvice main lene kaa prayaas karata he
 But since the latter film was filmed earlier, Blofeld was cast in the Diamonds Are Forever story to give Bond an opportunity to reprimand Blofeld
 iskaa arth tha ki blofeld ke bare main fleming kii teen kahaniyon ke bajaay ve chaar thi
 Connery returned to non-eon Never Again Again in 12 years in this role

 1972 kii shuruuaat main, conary ke pratisthaapan kii khoj ek baar phir shuru ho gai
 Jeremy Brett, Michael Billington and Julian Glover were considered for the next film in the series, Live and Let Die, and forty-five-year-old Roger Moore was selected
 moore sabase lambey samay tak bond rahe or unhone is kirdaar main baarah saal bitaaye or saat filmein kii
 Moore tried not to mimic his role as Sean Connery or Simon Templar in The Saint, and he played Bond in a more pleasing and humorous appearance
 jis tareeke se lezenbai ko pesh kiya gaya tha, uske thik vipareet moore kii pehali do filmon main bond filmon ke aam roopaankanon ko vastav main dur rakhaa gaya or use cigarette ke bajaay cigar diya gaya or vah martini ke bajaay borbon peetaa he
 One reviewer stated, "sean Connery doesn't have any seriousness in Roger Moore
 

 vah nirdeshak dwaara bond kii ghaatak hasya abhinayta ke rup main prastuti main daksh rup se baithta he"
 As part of the challenge to create his own version of Bond, Moore mixed some of the characteristics of his role in his series The Saint with Bond's personality
 aalochakon ko yah bond ek jaadugar adhik laga, adhik anugrahpurn, adhik vishleshnatmak or adhik beparwaah rup se or ek had tak nirlypt bhav se kaamuk laga
 He is physically as strong as Connery, but not as handsome in action
 moore ke sanskaran ne anya bond kii tulana main fantasy or hasya ko adhik apanaaya

 Roger Moore's third film, The Spy Who Loved Me, proved decisive for the series in two ways: it was the first film to be produced by Broccoli alone, as his half of the Bond film franchise due to a huge debt to Harry Saltzman in 1975 The share was forced to sell for twenty million pounds; And in that sense, it was also the first film to incorporate an entirely new story, as Ian Fleming only allowed the title of the novel to be used
 moore kii chauthi film, munarekar, bond kii aakhri film thi jiske liye fleming ke upanyaas kaa sheershak istemaal kiya gaya, lekin kaaphi baad main 2006 main kisino royaal ke sheershak kaa upyog kiya gaya
 The title was used from Bond's short story collection for the next two films, For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy, and the story of both films incorporated various material from this collection
 film octopussi ko, fleming kii isi naam kii laghu katha kii agali kadi ke rup main padhaa ja saktaa he
 Moore showed interest in leaving the series after the 1981 film, For Your Eyes Only, after which many young actors began to give screen tests for the role, including James Brolin, Oliver Tobias and Michael Billington
 However, EON eventually persuaded him to make a comeback in the 1983 Octopussy, as the non-eon film Never Say Never Again was released the same year
 kyonki ve aavashyak ection or charitra kii maang ke hisaab se umrdaraj ho gaye the film main aksar hi stant dubles kaa istemaal kiya gaya or keval nazadik se dikhne vaale moore nishchit rup se moore hai
 Moore only regretted his last film, a View to Kill, which was rejected by critics
 shaun conary ko pratisthapit karne ke liye timothy dalton par 1968 main vichaar kiya gaya tha, lekin ve yah mahasoos karte hue apane screen test se chale gaye ki 22 varsh kii umr main ve is bhoomika ke liye bahut chote hai
 12 years later, Dalton was approached again, presumably to replace Roger Moore in For Your Eyes Only, but the producers had no script and feared that he would be asked to do films like Spy Who Loved Me / Moonrecker Jaega ”which was not compatible with his concept of Bond films
 " dalton pratham abhinayta the jinhen da living delits kii peshkash kii gai thi, lekin shuru main unhen inkaar karnaa padaa kyonki shooting kii mul tareekhen unki brenda star film kii patibaddhtaon se takaraa rahi thim
 Pierce Broznan was then hired, but when his canceled television show Steel Remington was renewed in 1986, he could not progress
 kai abhinaytaon kaa screen test liya gaya, jisamen shaamil the sam nil or lui colins, jiske baad dalton ko nirmaan kii sanshodhit tareekhen pesh kii gayi jise ve sweekaar karne main samarth the or jaise hi ve brenda star ke filmakan se nivrutt hue unhone khud ko da living dellites ke set par paaya
 Dalton, best known for his stage and television roles and trained in the British Shakespearean tradition, had a strikingly different Bond from his predecessors
 da gargian ne tippanee kii, "dalton main conary kii swaabhaavik garima nahin he or naa hi moore kaa satahi aakarshan, lekin vah lezenbai bhi nahin he
 "the film reverted to realism and a more believable plot, with less space for fantasy and unnecessary humor

 The British Board of Film Classification demanded a cut due to the film's darker and more violent plot
 ioen dwaara license tu kil aisi pehali bond film thi jiske liye fleming ke kisi bhi upanyaas yaa laghu katha ke sheershak kaa upyog nahin kiya gaya

 Reviews for the film were mixed

 In 1989, the year of Dalton's second and last appearance, MGM / UA was sold to Australian-based broadcasting group Quintex, which wanted to merge the company with Pathe

 Due to these legal disputes, this series had to go through a gap of six years
 However, EON began pre-production of another film in May 1990, which was to be released in late 1991
 "bond 17" ke liye aam prachaar saamagree kaa kareeb usee samay kans film samaaroh main anaavaran kiya gaya

 Due to legal disputes, the production of Dalton's third film was postponed several times
 1993 main ek saakshaatkaar main, timothy dalton ne kaha ki maaikel france film ke liye kahani likh rahe the, jiskaa nirmaan kaary 1994 main janvari yaa farvari main shuru hona tay tha
 It never started and Dalton resigned from the role in April 1994

 By then, the world had changed rapidly and Broznan had also gone through a period of change

" Although Connery's Scottish background, Lesenbai's Australian background, or Timothy Dalton's Welsh ancestry were seldom noted in the past, some British fans thought it was strange to see Bond playing an Irishman
 broznan kaa bond cigar peetaa tha or vah italvi nirmit suut pasand karata tha
 More importantly, Broznan's goldeneye was the first film in the series to be produced after the disintegration of the Soviet Union
 isse yah andeh upajataa he ki kya bond aadhunik duniya main abhi bhi praasangik hai, kyonki pichhali kai filmon ne unhen soviet pratidwandviyon ke khilaaf khadaa kiya tha

 film udyog ke kuch logon ne mahasoos kiya ki bond shrunkhlaa ko waapas laana "vyarth" hoga or kaha ki use "ateet ke ek iken" ke rup main chhod dena behatar he
 However, when it was released, the film was seen as a successful effort that effectively transformed the series into the 1990s
 is film ko conary kii yu onli liv twis ke baad se sarvaadhik sweekruti mili
 Tom Shone commented, "connery has no qualities in Broznan but has carefully guarded himself from Moore's faults

 The studio was recently sold to billionaire Kirk Kirkorian, who wanted the film to be released at the same time with his public share offering and to audiences around the world
 sah-nirmaataa maaikel ji wilson ne kaha, "aap jaanate hai ki darshakon kii sankhya apaar he or mujhe lagata he ki aap aisi film nahin bananaa chahenge jo unhen kisi bhi tarah niraash karne vaali ho

 Broznan played Bond in the other two films, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day, and a video game, Everything and Nothing, after which EON announced Broznan was no longer needed as the film series was renewed And the search is on for a new 007

 During 2004, it was rumored that negotiations between the producers to pave the way for a new and younger actor broke down

 In July 2004, Broznan announced that he was leaving the role and said "bond is behind me, a second lifetime", with some considering it another unsuccessful negotiation move

 British actor Colin Salmon, who played the role of Charles Robinson, who played MI6 in other Bond films with Pierce Broznan, was also considered for the role, and there was speculation that he would become the first black James Bond
 According to Martin Campbell, the only Henry Kavil was the only actor who was in serious competition for the role
 lekin us samay keval 22 saal ke hone ke kaaran, unhen is kirdaar ke liye bahut chota mana gaya
 In May 2005, Daniel Craig announced that Sony and MGM and producer Michael G
 Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured him that he would get the role of Bond, but by that time EON Productions had not approached him
 baad main, craig ne kaha ki nirmaataaon ne vastav main unhen bhoomika kii peshkash kii he, lekin unhone is prastaav ko tab tak ke liye thukraa diya jab tak ki unhen padhane ke liye script uplabdh nahin karai jaati
 Encouraged by the success of Universal Pictures rival Jason Bourne Franchise, MGM and EON decided to "bring Bond back to its original form" with the removal of his idiosyncrasies and irrelevant fictional elements that define the series Were engaged and it was decided to introduce a more strict, darker and more genuine Bond than any of its former film avatars May coincide with Ian Fleming's original novel Bond
 is prakaar, bond kii 21veen film kisino royaal, pehali film thi jo 1974 kii di main wyeth di golden gan ke baad se fleming ke kisi upanyaas kaa filmi roopantaran thi
 The franchise had to be a restructuring, setting a new timeline and narrative structure that was not part of any previous film
 This not only freed Bond Franchise from the continuity of the last forty years but also allowed the film to feature a less experienced and more delicate Bond
 ateet main jaisaa ki nae bondon ke parichay ke maamle main tha, is film ne nirmaan vistaar ko hataane kaa or mul tatwon par waapas lautne kaa avasar pradaan kiya
 As of August 2005, speculation was rife that 37-year-old Daniel Craig was being seriously considered, although the entire character selection for the role was not actually made until early September
