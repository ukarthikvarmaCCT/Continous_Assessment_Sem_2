 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is

 It would be desirable to understand the views of those philosophers and their relationship with the revolution before passing judgment on any opinion
 darshanikon ke vichaaron kii lokapriyata kaa nirdhaaran to us samay unke chape lekhon ke sanskarnon or prasar ke aadhaar par dekha janaa chahie
 Montescue in his book 'the Spirit of Laws' contradicted the principles of the king's divine rights and offered not only a critique of French political institutions but also an alternative
 usne likhaa ki francisi sarkaar nirkunsh sarkaar he kyonki france main karypalika, nyaaypalika or vidhayika sambandhi sabhi shaktiyaan ek hi vyakti arthath raja ke haathon main kendrit he isliye france kii janata ko swatantraaa praapt nahin he
 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi
 Thus his ideas that Montescue hurt France's autocratic state system through segregation of power became so popular that six editions were published in three years of 'the Spirit of Lodges'
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane kii baat yah he ki montescue ne na to kranti kii baat kii or na hi rajtantr ko samaapt karne kii usne to sirp nirankush rajtantr ke dosha ko ujagar kiya or sanvaidhanik rajtantr kii baat kii

 jin logon ko karypalika shakti saupin gai he ve janata ke swami nahin uske kaaryakari he, or unka kartavya janata kii ajna kaa paalan karnaa he
 In this way he firmly believed that the paramount power should be in the hands of the public and not in the hands of any individual or institution
 saarvbhaum satta janata kii ichha main nihit he jise “saamaanya ichha” kaha gaya
 The law of the state should be an expression of this common desire, but the nature of the law is no longer such, but it is dependent on the will of the ruler
 ruson ne bhi kranti kii baat nahin kii lekin sabhi vyakti ko swatantra evam samaan mana or francisi kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav usee ke vichaaron se prabhavit the
 Napoleon acknowledged his importance and said that if there had not been the Russians, there would not have been a revolution in France

 The meeting of the States General was finally called

 All classes were excited to hear the news of the meeting of the States General
 kulina ummid thi ki is baithak main ve un visheshadhikaron ko praapt kar sakenge jo lui 14waan ke samay usne chhin liye gaye the
 The people of the middle class believed that they would be able to formulate progressive policies in their favor
 kisaanon ko aashaa thi ki vah saamanti visheshadhikaron ke viruddh aawaaj uthaakar apane adhikaron ko surakshit kar unke shoshan chakra se mukt ho sakenge
 In this way no significant portion of the French population was ready to support the French monarchy
 estats general ke adhiveshan main matadhikaar paddati ke mudde par tritiy state evam anya state ke bich vivaad ho gaya
 Voting was said that each state would be considered to have only one vote
 is prakaar visheshadhikaar praapt varg kaa do tathaa jansadharan kaa ek hi mat hota he
 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court

 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages
 is charan main paris kii bheed ne bastil ke kile par niyantran sthapit kiya
 This is how the revolution started
 vastutah bastil kaa kila nirankushta evam atyaachaar kaa pratik tha or iske patan se puraatan vyavastha kaa gahari chunauti mili
 The incident also affected the rural areas of France and the villagers set fire to the records of feudal taxes

 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791
 samvidhan main do baton par bal diya gaya-ek, rajya kii saarvbhaum shakti janata main nihit he or doosraa, shakti kaa pruthakkaran rajya evam janata ke hit main he

 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune

 In this way, the entire state system from the local level to the central level came to the Barja class

 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized
 paris kii bheed par inkaa prabhaav tha
 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc
 duusari taraf jirondist the- ye shikshit or susanskrit log the
 He had more book knowledge
 faltah ye vyaavhaarik raajnneetijna nahin the
 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc
 yahaan samajhane kii baat yah he ki donon hi gut ganatantr ke himachati the, videshi shaktiyon ke viruddh yuddh kaa samarthan karte the
 The difference was only in form
 vastutah jirodisto ne france main udaaravaadi sthaan grahan kar liya tha
 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prasha and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was referring to the referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives
 antat july 1794, main robspier kaid kar liya gaya or faansee de di gai isi ke saath aantak ke rajya kii samaapti hui
 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror
 udaaravaadi thermidorian netaaon ne desh kii satta sanbhali or aantak rajya kii vyavasthaaon ko bhang kiya, jacobiyans ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 In this way, the Directory of Rule in France began after the National Convention which lasted from 1795 to 1799
 atan main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar diya
 This directory rule was disorganized, sad
 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi
 In such a situation, the people of France felt the need for a ruler who could establish peace inside and outside the country and defeat foreign powers
 is kaal main nepolian ne sainya vijayon dwaara france ke sammaan ko sthapit kiya or antat diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar satta par niyantran sthapit kiya
 In 1799, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule and became the first Council of France and declared himself Emperor in 1804 and thus Napoleon's dictatorial imperialist rule began
 europe main france hi vah desh he jisane kranti ke madhyam se puraatan vyavastha ke patan ko sunishchit kiya
 The impact of this revolution was not limited to Europe
 isane samast vishwa ko prabhavit kiya
 The slogans of revolution spread freedom, equality and fraternity throughout Europe
 ek taraf isane jahaan rashtrawaad, janatantrwaad jaisi nai shaktiyon ko panpane kaa mauka diya to duusari taraf aadhunik taanaashaahee or sainikwaad kii neenv bhi daali
 The effects of the French Revolution can be understood under the following points: francisi kranti kii prakruti ko kranti ke aadarshon, kranti ke netritv, kranti kii pragati, kranti ke dauraan laae gaye parivartanon or vishwa par pade prabhaavon ke prakaash main samajhe jane kii jarurat he
 From this point of view, the revolution was a revolution that was started by the elite, then later it came into the hands of the middle class
 kuch samay ke liye yah krantikari tatwon ke prabhaav main rahi or ant ek sainik taanashaah ke saath hua
 In this way, the French Revolution started like a huge river that started from the high mountain peak and crossed several small mountains in the path, at a rapid, if slow, speed
 1789 main hui francisi kranti ko ek burjua kranti ke rup main dekha ja sakaata he
 The leadership in the first phase of the revolution was in the hands of the bourgeois elements of the Third State
 madhyavargeey netritv ne nijee sampatti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch siddhanth bhi banaaen
 In fact, the end of feudalism was declared but feudal rights were not only abandoned, but only after compensating the landlords, the peasants could be relieved of any responsibility
 maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa main madhyavargeey prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 The right to property was placed in the category of natural rights of man which is related to the protection of bourgeois interests
 isi prakaar vayask matadhikaar kii baat to kii gai kintu samvidhan main “naagarik” shabd kaa atyant sankuchit arthon main prayog kiya gaya
 Citizens were divided into active and passive citizens
 sakriy naagarik ve the jo apni kam se kam teen din ke aay kii rakam pratyaksh kar ke rup main adaa karte the or sirp inhen hi mat dene kaa adhikaar tha
 The ability of property to be representative was also made a basis and it was only the rich who could participate in political activities and this meant that the rich people belonged to the middle class
 is tarah francisi kranti ne janm par aadhaarit bhedbhaav ko nasht kiya parantu uske jagah pracheen samantvaad ke badale dhan par aadhaarit nae samantvaad kaa prabhutv hua
 During the revolution, the revolutionaries talked about the loans taken by the autocratic government, but no one talked about forgiving those loans
 iskaa kaaran tha yah rin sarkaar ko burjua varg ne diya tha
 Similarly, the government seized the property of the church but it was not distributed to the landless
 jameenon ko sarvaadhik oonchi keemton par bechaa gaya or is jameen ko kharidne kii kshamta madhyavarg ke paas thi
 The French Revolution ignored the interests of the workers and discouraged the labor movement
 kranti ke dauraan shramik varg ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi kintu burjua netritv ko uski badhati sthiti manjuur nahin thi
 Therefore, the National Assembly re-enacted the laws made in the autocratic monarchy era
 jiske tahat sabhi shramik sangh sambandhi kaaryon par pratibandh laga diya gaye or gildon ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In the National Assembly, the bourgeoisie dominated and the Jirondist and Jacobians also belonged to the bourgeoisie
 yadhyapi jacobiyan sarvhaara varg ke hit kii baat karte the parantu aatank ke rajya kii sthapana main burjua hiton ko hi upar rakhaa gaya or shramikon pratikriyaaon ko dabaane hetu sena kii sahaayta lee gai
 Middle-class interests were also given prominence in directory governance
 sanchaalak mandal ne jis dwisadani vidhayika kaa nirmaan kiya uske sabhi sadsy madhyavargeey buddhijivi the
 The bourgeoisie effect can also be seen on Napoleon's reforms
 usne burjua hiton ko sangrakshit rakhte hue apni vidhi samhita main sampatti ke adhikaar ko surakshit rakhaa, kulinon ko apekshaakrit vyapak adhikaar die tathaa uske vyapaarik or vanijyik sudhaaron kaa phayda madhyavarg ko hi mila
 In this way, middle class elements are seen in the form of revolution
 kintu puure kranti or uske prabhaav ke vishleshan se yah spasht hota he ki kranti main madhyavargeey tatwon ke saath krishak, majdoor, mahilaon kii sahamaagita thi
 In this way, it was not just a middle class revolution, but it can be seen as a popular revolution
 francisi kranti ek vishwavyaapee charitra ko liye hue thi
 The revolutionaries declared human and civil rights in 1789, under which it was said that being born equal from birth, all human beings should get equal rights and this is for all nations, for all human beings, for all time and for example
 Are for the world
 yah ghoshnaa sirp france ke liye nahin varan har jagah ke un sabhi logon kii bhalaai ke liye hai jo swatantra hona chaahate the tathaa nirankush rajtantr evam saamanti visheshadhikaron ke boj se mukti paanaa chaahate the, banaaya gaya tha
 In 1792 AD, the English hero named Kompene was awarded the title of French citizen by the National Assembly and was also elected a delegate to the National Convention
 isi prakaar kranti ke dauraan yah vichaar aayaa ki kranti ko sthaayee or sudrudh rakhane ke liye ise europe ke anya deshon main bhi vistaarit kiya jaaen
 It envisages a war in which French forces enter neighboring countries and meet local revolutionaries and overthrow the monarchy and establish republics
 france kii kranti maatr ek rashtriya ghatana nahin thi apitu siddhanton- swatantraaa, samanta evam bandhutav ke naaron se sampurna europe gunj uthaa
 The effects of the revolution were so far-reaching that all of Europe was covered by it
 isi sandarbh main kaha gaya “yadi france ko zukam hota he to samast europe cheenkta he
 " france kii kranti roosi kranti ke samaan suniyojit nahin thi
 In fact, the Russian Revolution was planned by the Bolsheviks and its aim was to establish the rule of the proletariat by gaining power, but the French Revolution was a victim of events and circumstances from the beginning to the end and the events did not happen in the way that the revolutionaries wished but rather the events gave the revolutionaries Forced to change his path
 stats general kii baithak main yadi tritiy state kii baat anya stats ne maan lee hoti to kranti kaa ruukh doosraa hota
 Similarly, the state of terror and the rule of the directory also did not run in a planned manner
 is drushti se yah kranti avyavasthit thi
 The degeneration of erstwhile French society was also an important factor in the origins of the French Revolution
 puraa samaaj visheshadhikaar praapt or adhikaar viheen virgon main vibhakt tha
 The condition of the peasants was bad due to the burden of taxes, on the other hand they had to suffer exploitation by the tyranny of the feudal and the intervention of the church
 in sthitiyon ne kranti ko raah dikhaai or krantikariyon ne isi asamanta ke viruddh aawaaj buland kii or swatantraaa, samanta tathaa bandhutav kaa naaraa diya
 It was only during the revolution that the end of feudalism was announced, the privileges were abolished

 In fact, during the revolution, a dictatorial government or dictatorship was established under the leadership of Robspier and later the Nepalese also established the dictatorship
 france kii kranti vahaan kii puraatan vyavastha main vyaapt tamaam vikrutiyon, visangatiyon evam buniyadi dosha ke viruddh ek shashakt pratikriya thi
 The revolution paved the way for democratic governance in France by ending French society based on autocratic monarchy inequality, luxury clergy and the crisis facing economic insolvency
 is drushti se ise drushti se ise pragatisheel kranti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he Not only this, the declaration of human rights, the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity and the ideology of nationalism made the whole world aware of the slogan of nationalism and the ideology of nationalism
 italy evam germany ke ekikaran kii bhaavana ko protsaahan mila
 The issue of segregation of religion and politics first arose during this revolution

 France's state revolution enjoys special importance in world history, it is considered an important event in human history
 isamen na keval france balki europe ke jan jivan main amulya parivartan laa diya isamen shadiyon se chali aa rahi saamanti vyavastha ko nasht kar aadhunik loktantric vyavastha kaa maarg praast kiy
 The autocracy of the monarchy came to an end and people breathed peace in the democratic atmosphere
 is samay hamaare saamne yah prashan uthta he ki 1789 i
 main kranti kaa sutrapat anya europe deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi kyon hui
 a study of European nations of the 18th century showed that the condition of France at that time was worse than that of other Europe nations
 nirankush rajtantr suvidha yukt varg or karon ke asaahneey bhaar se dabaa hua tha
 Ordinary classes were present in almost all European countries
 kuch rajyon kii sthiti to france se bhi adhik vikrut thi prasha, austria or rus aadi france se bhi adhik vikrut the
 French farmers were happier than other European nations
 saadhaaran varg kii sthiti anya europe rajyon main or bhi kharaab thi
 Nevertheless, the revolution took place not in these countries but in France first
 iskaa pramukh kaaran yah tha kii france log apni sthiti ke prati jaagruk the
 It is not a necessary condition for revolution that its explosion takes place in the same countries where people are victims of atrocities, incest and exploitation
 samrudh or unnat desh main bhi kranti ho sakati he
 Provided that its residents feel that injustice is being done to them
 france kii janata is anyaay ko mahasus kar rahi thi
 Wanted to get away from it

 There were many reasons for this revolution which are as follows
 frasisi saamanton kaa badla hua swarup or kisaano kii unnat avasthaa- Such was the reason for the advanced state of French peasants and the changed nature of feudalism
 jiske chalate france main sarv pratham rajyakranti hui
 Farmers in the European country were still in a state of gloom

 They did not own their own land and own their own land in spite of such convenience and feudal services, they had to pay a large part of their income in the form of feudal tax
 or phir bhi uski sthiti acchhee dhi
 They used to buy some land by saving money and the hunger to buy land was constantly increasing, there was a problem of feudalism and unemployment, so they were thinking of removing the feudal occupations, so they got strength under the leadership of the middle class
 And in 1789 AD they revolted
 france main udaar nirankushta kii parampara kaa abhaav- Other European countries also had autocratic monarchies
 parantu vahaan ke samraaton ne samaynusaar apni nirankushta main kami kar di thi
 King Fredirak of Prasha was the great enlightened administrator of his time
 jiskaa anusaran europe ke anya desh rus germany, italy, spain aadi ne kiya
 In due course of time, he tried as much as possible to improve the economic, physical and other fields
 parantu france main is tarah ki udaar nirankushta kaa abhaav tha
 The kings there were doing nothing for the benefit of the people
 balki adhik tex vasulanaa or janata kaa shoshan karnaa unki niti ban gai thi
 Therefore, the French people were fed up with it, so the people of France wanted to end the autocratic monarchy
 maadyam varg kii jaagarukta- The reason for the first revolution in France was the middle class there
 anya deshon main bhi madhyam varg thi parantu ve france kii tarah saanskriti, dhani evam shikshit nahin the
 He lacked strength
 ve raja ke khilaaf baghawat karne kii soch nahin sakate the
 The middle class people in France were dissatisfied with their emperors for many reasons
 or apni raksha ke liye raaj satta par ankush lagane ke liye utawala ho rahe the
 Other European states lacked this type of situation
 anya deshon main netritv karne vaala koi nahin tha france main jaagruk madhyamvarg taiyaar tha
 Therefore, revolution first took place in France itself
 kulinvarg kii anupayogita- The elite Vigyan was given the first privilege to help the king in running the rule
 or ve janaata kii raksha bhi karte the
 But slowly - 2 started doing this work for the king's employees

 Yet there was no cut in its prerogative
 isliye kisaan or madhyam varg ke log kulinvarg se ghrinaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries
 vahaan abhi bhi kulinon ki payogita bani hui thi
 The influence of philosophers 18 veen shatabdi main sampoorn europe main boudik halchal machi hui thi
 Philosophers, thinkers, scientists were present in all countries

 Who presented the psychological basis of the revolution
 unhone samaaj main vaypt buraaiyon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrisht karaayaa or muk janata ko vaani di
 Such an attempt was not being made in other countries
 montegu, waltare ruso aadi vichaarkon kaa kaary kshetra france hi tha
 Austria, Prasha and Russia did not have such thinkers
 europe ke anya deshon main logon kaa unki vaastavik sthiti bataane vaala or unamem santosh paidaa karne vaala darshanikon kaa koi varg nahin tha
 This was a major reason for revolution in France itself
 raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaa abhaav- When the middle class became aware in England, they were given the opportunity to participate in the politics of the country
 parantu france ke saath aisi baat nahin thi
 The middle class of France was quite dissatisfied with its emperors
 unki apeksha kii jaati thi
 Despite being educated, they did not have a reputation like the nobles
 unhen france kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, he dissented and raised the slogan of revolution
 ayogy raja tathaa prashasan main bhrashtachar- The political system of France was centralized but the kings were inept
 prashasan main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha
 In other countries of Europe, autocratic rule was broken but kings were eligible and they had full control over governance
 france kaa madhyam varg is prashasnic bhrashtatar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 And so he was ready to revolt
 rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai- At this time, national sentiment began to rise rapidly in Europe
 sampoorn europe main france hi ek aisa desh tha jahaan ek raashtra bhaavana kaa purnat: abhaav tha
 Due to this, there was a revolution in France for the first time
 america swatantraaa sangram kaa prabhaav- The American War of Independence started in 1766 AD
 gimen america ke logon ne england ke khilaaf vidroh kar kar diya
 The soldiers of France also got an opportunity to participate in this freedom struggle, so they felt that freedom can be achieved through war
 unhone yah bhi anubhav kiya ki swatantraaa so hi sukh kii prapti sambhav he
 On returning to France, he saw that the freedom he fought for in America is the complete lack of freedom in France

 19 veen sadi ke madhya main charles darwin ne prakritik varan dwaara kram-vikaas kaa vaigyanik siddhant diya
 He published it in his book Jeevajatya Ka Udgeet
 prakritik chayan dwaara kram-vikaas kii prakriya ko nimnlikhit avlokanon se sabit kiya ja saktaa he : 1) jitani santaanen sambhawatah jivit rah sakati hai, us se adhik paidaa hoti hai, 2) aabaadi main roopaatmak, shaareerik or vyavhaarik lakshanon main vividhta hoti he, 3) alag-alag lakshan uttar-jivan or prajnan kii alag-alag sambhaavna pradaan karte hai, or 4) lakshan ek peedi se agali peedi ko die jate hai
 Thus, generation after generation the population is replaced by offspring of individuals who are better adapted to that biophysical environment
 prakritik varan kii prakriya is abhaasi uddeshypurnataa se un lakshanon ko banati or barkaraar rakhti he jo apni kaaryaatmak bhoomika ke anukool hon
 Natural selection is a known cause of adaptation, but there are other known causes of evolution
 micro-kram-vikaas ke anya gaiyr-anukuli kaaran utparivartan or genetic drift hai
 In 1842, Charles Darwin wrote his first sketch of On the Origin of Species
 mukhya lekh: vikaswad kaa itihaas The proposition that one type of one organism may descend from another goes back to some pre-secret Greek philosophers such as Unaximander and Empodoclus

 John Ray applied one of the earlier more general terms of plant and animal types to defined natural types, "species", but he strictly identified each type of living thing as one species and proposed that Each species can be defined by features that surprise themselves generation after generation

 Other naturalists of this time speculate on the evolutionary change of species according to natural laws over time
 1751 main, piyare louis mouprartus ne prajnan ke dauraan hone vaali prakritik sanshodhano ke bare main likhaa or nai prajatiyon kaa utpaadan karne ke liye kai pidiyon se sanchit kiya
 georges-louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffafon suggested that the species may deteriorate into different organisms, and Erasmus Darwin proposed that all warm-blooded animals could descend from the same microorganism

 These ideas were condemned by established naturalists because it was speculated to lack empirical support
 vishesh rup se, george kyuver ne jor dekar kaha ki prajatiyaan asambandhit or nirdhaarit hai, unki samanthaayen kaaryaatmak jaruraton ke liye divine dizin ko darshaati hai is bich, wiliam paili ne red ke vichaaron ko prakritik dharamshastra yaa isaayiyon ke astitv or astitv ke devtaa main viksit kiya tha, jo ki divine dizin ke saboot ke rup main jatil roopantaron kaa prastaav tha or jise charles darwin ne prashansa kii thi
 a significant break from the concept of the constant typological class or type in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, formulated by Charles Darwin in the context of extreme populations
 thomas robert malths dwaara jansankhya ke siddhant par ek niabandh se aanshik rup se prabhavit, darwin ne kaha ki jansankhya vruddhi se "astitv ke liye sangharsh" ho saktaa he jisamen anukool bhinnata prabal ho jaati he kyonki anya kii mrityu ho jaati he
 In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to reproductive age because of limited resources
 yah sabhi prakaar ke jeevon ke liye usee tarah prakritik kanoonon ke kaam ke madhyam se ek aam vansh se paudhon or jaanwaron kii vividhta samajha saktaa he
 Darwin developed the theory of "natural selection" from 1838 onwards and began writing his "big book" on the subject when Alfred Russell Wallace sent him a version of the same theory in about 1858
 unke alag-alag patr 1858 kii baithak main ek saath prastut kiye gaye the landan socity of landan kii
 In late 1859, Darwin's publication of his "essence" as On the Origin of Spastis explained natural selection in detail and in a way that led to an increasingly widespread acceptance of Darwin's concepts of evolution at the expense of alternative theories
 thomas henry huxley ne manushyon ke liye darwin ke vichaaron ko lagu kiya, peleotology or tulanaatmak sharir rachana ke prayog se thos pramaan pradaan karne ke liye ki insaanon or apis ne ek aam vansh ko saajha kiya
 Some people were troubled by this because it was implied that humans had no special place in the universe
 prajnan anuvanshikta or nae gunon kii utpatti ke tantra ek rahasy bane rahe
 In this direction, Darwin developed his own temporal theory of pangenesis
 1865 main, grager mendal ne bataaya ki tatwon ko swatantra vargeekaran or pruthakkaran tatwon ke madhyam se ek anumaanit tareeke se viraasat main mila
 Mandal's laws of inheritance eventually fulfilled Darwin's most pangensis theory
 agast Weismann rogaanu koshikaon ke bich mahatvapurn antar he ki gametes or sharir kii daihik koshikaon ko janm de dikhaa, ki anuvanshikta keval rogaanu line ke madhyam se gujarata he
 Hugo de Wyss has linked Darwin's pangensis theory to Verizon's germ / soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangens were concentrated in the cell nucleus and that when expressed, they alter cytoplasm to alter cell structure

 To understand the origins of the new types, de Vries developed a mutation theory that created a temporary rift between those who accepted Durwinian evolution and biometricians who were allied with de Villes

 Since then, modern synthesis has been put forward to explain biological phenomena at the full and integrated scale of the biological hierarchy, from genes to species

 vanshanukramit gun jin dwaara niyantrit hote hai or jeevon ke jinom ke bheetar jin kaa puraa set isaki ginotip kehalaata he
 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment
 natijatan, ek jeev ke phenotype ke kai pahaluon ko viraasat main nahin miltaa he
 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn
 anuvanshik jaankaree diene ke madhyam se ek peedi se duusare ke paas ja sakate hai, ek anu jo anuvanshik jaankaree ko encode karte hai
 DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases
 ek vishesh diene anu ke saath kursiyaan kaa anukram anuvaanshik jaankaree ko nirdisht karata he, ek vaakya ko varnit patron ke anukram ke samaan
 Before the cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the two cells will inherit the DNA sequence as a result

 The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a location
 agar kisi vyakti ke bich ek sthaan par diene anukram bhinn hota he, to is anukram ke vibhinn roopon ko elils kaha jaataa he
 DNA sequences can be altered through mutations, creating new alleles
 yadi ek jin ke bheetar ek utparivartan hota he, to nae elil ko prabhavit kar sakate hai ki jin ke niyantran, jeev ke phenotip ko badalte hai
 However, while in some cases this simple correspondence between alleles and a trait, most traits are more complex and quantitative properties are controlled by loci

 a significant portion of phenotypic variation in the population is due to genotypic variation
 aadhunik vikasvaadi sanshleshan is anuvaanshik vividhta main samay ke saath parivartan ke rup main vikaas ko paribhaashit karata he
 The frequency of a particular allele will become more or less prevalent to other variants of that gene

 Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of development
 yah aarekh sex kii dohari laagat ko darshata he
 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation
 phir bhi eukeriots or bahukoshikeey jeevon ke bich yon prajnan prajnan ke adhik saamaanya saadhan hai
 The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to understand the importance of sexual reproduction as a means of enabling continuous development and adaptation in response to co-evolution with other species in an ever-changing environment
 is
 adhik jaankaree: jin pravahjan pravaah jansankhya or prajatiyon ke bich jin kaa aadan-pradaan hota he
 It may therefore be a source of diversity that is new to the population or a species
 Gene flow may be due to the movement of individuals between different populations of organisms, as the movement of mice or grasses between inland and coastal populations
 k may be due to the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations

 It is often called the "self-sustaining" mechanism because it is necessary that according to three simple facts: akruti vigyaan, sharir vigyaan or vyavhaar ke sambandh main jeevon kii aabaadi ke bheetar bhinnata maujuud he
 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai
 The main concept of natural selection is the ability to develop an organism
 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "
 " mahatvapurn baat, elil kii fitness ek nishchit visheshta nahin he; agar paryaavaran main parivartan, pehle tatasth yaa hanikaarak lakshan phydemand ho sakate hai or pehle laabhakaari gun hanikaarak ho jate hai
 However, even if the direction of selection is reversed in this way, symptoms lost in the past may not re-develop into a uniform form
 ek visheshta ke liye aabaadi ke bheetar prakritik chayan, jo vibhinn prakaar ke mulyon jaise oonchai par bhinn ho sakate hai, ko teen alag-alag prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he pehla dishaatmak chayan hota he, jo ki samay ke saath ek vishesh gun ke ausat mulya main badlaav hota he- udhaaharan ke liye, jeev dhire-dhire oonche ho jate hai
 Second, disruptive selection is selection for highly trait values and often becomes the most common of the two different values, with selection against the mean value
 yah tab hoga jab yaa to laghu yaa ucch jeevon kaa ek phayda hota he, lekin madhyam oonchai ke nahin hote ant main, chayan ko sthir karne main donon ore donon ore ke charam vishesh gunon ke bich chayan hota he, jo ausat mulya or kam vividhta ke aas-paas bhinnata ko kam karata he
 This, for example, causes organisms to gradually become all the same height
 natural sellection kaa ek vishesh maamla yon chayan hota he, jo kisi bhi gun ke liye chayan hota he jo sambhog kii safalataa ko badhaata he or sambhavit mitron ke jeevon ke aakarshan ko badhaata he
 Characteristics developed through sexual selection are especially prominent among males of many animal species
 yadhyapi kaamuk rup se isht, haalanki bojhil sing, sangat kol, bade sharir ke aakaar or ujjwal rang jaise lakshan aksar prerana ko aakarshith karte hai, jo ki vyaktigat purushon ke astitv se samjhauta karte hai
 This survival loss is balanced by high reproductive success in men who show these difficult-to-fake, sexually selected traits
 natural sellection sabase aam taur par swabhaav ko maapta he jiske khilaaf vyaktiyon or vyaktigat gunon ko jivit rahane kii adhik sambhaavna he
 In this sense "nature" refers to an ecosystem, namely a system in which organisms interact with all other elements in their local environment, both physically and biologically

 This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to characterize specific forces that, together, include natural selection
 prakritik chayan sanghathan ke vibhinn staron par kaary kar saktaa he, jaise ki jin, koshika, vyaktigat jeev, jeevon or prajatiyon ke samooh
 Selection can work at multiple levels simultaneously
 vyaktigat jeev ke str ke neeche hone vaale chayan kaa ek udhaaharan transporens naamak jin he, jo ek jinom main dohraane or fail saktaa he
 Selection at a level above the individual, such as group selection, may allow for the development of cooperation, as described below yah bhi dekhen: maanav kaa vikaas See also: History of Earth adhik jaankaree: abiogenesis, pencparmia, or arene vishwa kii avadharanaprithvi 4

 vartmaan prajatiyaan vikaas kii prakriya main ek charan hai, unki vividhta ke saath prajati or vilupt hone kii ghatnaon kii lambii shrinkhalaa kaa utpaada he
 The common ancestry of organisms is first inferred from four simple facts about organisms: First, they have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptation
 doosraa, jivan kii vividhta puri tarah se anuthe jeevon kaa ek set nahin he, parantu aise jeev hai, jo roopaatmak samanthaayen saajha karte hai
 Third, implicit traits with no explicit purpose are similar to functional ancestral traits and, finally, the use of these similarities can be classified into a category of nested groups — similar to a family tree

 However, this approach is most successful for organisms that have difficult parts of the body, such as shells, bones, or teeth

 Soon after the rise of these earliest multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared in about 10 million years, in a program called the Cambrian explosion

 He has descended on the earth like Cupid, having completed fourteen arts
 shuk ke mukh se prithviraj kii prashansa sun kar yadav kumari padmavati kaa man prithviraj ke prati anurakt ho gaya
 But Padmavati, who attained youth, had been married by Vijayapala to Kumudamani
 kumudmani kumaun pradesh kaa raja tha
 The princess was getting married in the sea region
 dusri ore apane vivaah ke samachar sunakar padmavati vyakul thi
 After that she said to Shuk, "O kir! Shuk! You soon go to Delhi and call my dear Prithviraj here"
 uske pashchaat padmavati ne shuk ko ek patr diya
 Hey Kshatriya Kulbhushan! i love you with my whole heart
 yadi aap mujhe or mere kul ko varanyogy maanate hai, to meraa panigrahan kar ke mere praanon kii raksha karen
 My marriage is fixed on the Shukladvadashi date of Vaishakhamas of 1130 Shakasamvatsara
 atah usase purv aakar shrikrishna ne jaise rukmini kaa haran kiya tha, vaise hi meraa haran kar ke mujhe krutharth karen
 --- Padmavati shuk ne vayuveg se dehali ja kar prithviraj ko patr diya
 After reading the letter, Prithviraj started the journey with the feudatories towards the sea city
 dusri ore kumudmani ne kumaun se varyatra prarambh kii
 On receiving the news that Prithviraj is going to sea, Muhammad Ghori also started the journey towards the sea
 uske pashchaat samudrashikhar ja rahe kumudmani ke aagaman kaa samachar sun kar padmavati ati vyakula ho gai
 Because he did not get news of Prithviraj's arrival
 atah vah prasaad ke vaatayan par baith kar maarg ko vihval man se dekhati hui pratiksha karte hue ro rahi thi
 At the same time, Shuk came and said to him, "O beautiful! Shiva is in the temple nearest to you
 tum sheeghra hi vahaan joon"
 On hearing Shuk's words, the eyes of Padmavati who were revived suddenly shone
 naveen vastra dhaaran kar sugandhit jal se snaan kar shodash shringaar karke apni sakhion ke saath vah swarna sthalika main deep lekar shivalay gai
 After reaching Shivalaya, worshiping Shiva Parvati and went towards Prithviraj
 uske pashchaat apane mukhaawaran ko hataa kar vah mugdh ho kar prithviraj ke soundarya ko dekhati rahi
 Prithviraj also went a little further and stood near Padmavati
 mandir kaa vah drishy dekh kar padmavati kii sakhiyaan sashcharya chakit hokar padmavati ko or prithviraj ko dekh rahi thi
 Because no one knew about Padmavati and Prithviraj's love except Shuk-6
 uske pashchaat prithviraj ne padmavati kaa haath apane haath main lekhakar ashwarohan kiya
 As soon as the journey of Prithviraj and Padmavati towards Dehli began, the news of Padmavatiharan spread everywhere in Samudrashanagar
 vijaypal or kumudmani prithviraj ke saath yuddh karan ke liye prithviraj ke peeche gaye
 Upon hearing the news of the arrival of Vijayapala and Kumadamani, Prithviraj became adorned for a bitter battle
 uske pashchaat vinaashak yuddh main vijayi prithviraj ne dehali kii ore yatra armbh kii
 But on the way, Muhammad Ghori attacked Prithviraj with his soldiers
 parantu ghori kii sena kii ghor paraajay hui
 All his soldiers were migrating here and Prithviraj made Ghori a prisoner and traveled towards Dehli
 dehali pahunch kar durga ke mandir main shubhamuhoort main prithviraj ne padmavati ke saath vivaah kar liya
 Historians believe that from the literary point of view the story is important, but from the historical point of view that story is not important
 kyonki itihaas main kahin par samudrashikhar naamak durg kaa or uske raja vijaypal kaa ullekh prapya nahin he
 Both names are fictitious
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, ye katha koi puraana kaaleen prasiddh katha hogi, jiskaa avlamban karke agyaat vyakti ne prithviraj raso kavy main prakshep kii hogi
 The second proof is that Chandbaradiyi has not composed the above story
 arthath 'top' dwaara choron disha main dhuaan ho gaya
 But in Indian history, the cannon was used in the battle of Panipat region on the twentieth day of April-month of 1526 years
 parantu jaganic rachit aalhakhand main baar baar topon ke upyog kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Although there is no historical fact in this story, yet the characters of Prithviraj and Padmavati are worthy in the story
 1236 vikram sanvatsar ke ashadhamas kii shukladashami buudhvaasar ko likhit ek shilaalekh pokaran se praapt hua he
 It mentions that, on the orders of Prithviraj, Mandleshwar named 'katia' donated a village called Pihilapaul in Lokeshwaramandir of Vijaypur
 gram ke saath tadaag, gram ke choro ore ke vishaal van bhi usne daan main diye the
 Padmavati was the daughter of a Paramaravanshi named Palhan
 katiya naamak mandaleshwar padmavati kaa bhai tha
 Prithviraj Raso Kavya mentions that Chandravati, the princess of Chandrapundir region was married to Prithviraj
 us ke garbh se sapadalaksh samrajya kaa uttaradhikari ranasi samudbhoot hua
 History is of the opinion that, Rainsi is a fictitious name, in fact its name is Govind Aasit
 parantu chandrapundeer pradesh kii rajkumaari kaa vivaah prithviraj se hua thaye uchit hi he 
 In the Prithviraj Vijay epic, the name Tilottama, in the Prithviraj Raso Kavya, in the name Sanyogita, in the Surjan Charit epic, the name 'kantimati' is mentioned
 sanyogita kaa ullekh rambhamgajri mahakavy main or hammir mahakavy main praapt nahin hota
 The loss of coincidence was an important event in history
 us samay prithviraj kii veerta kii prashansa chaaro dishaao main ho rahi thi
 Once Sanyogita heard the description of Prithviraj's bravery and beauty
 uske pashchaat wo unhen prem karne lagi
 On the other hand, Sanyogita's father Jayachand announced to marry Sanyogita through a swayamvar
 jayachand ne ashwamedhyagy kaa aayojan kiya tha
 At the conclusion of that Yajna, there was a Muhurta for the Sanyamvar of Sanyogita
 jayachand ashwamedhyagy karke bharat par swapratishtha kaa ichha rakhata tha
 But Prithviraj opposed him
 atah jayachand ne prithviraj ko swayamvar main aamantrit nahin kiya or usne dwarpal ke sthaan par prithviraj kii pratimaa sthapit kar di
 On the other hand, when Sanyogita learned that Prithviraj would be absent in the Swayamvara, he sent messengers to summon Prithviraj
 sanyogita mujhe prem karti he ye jaan kar prithviraj ne kannauj nagar kii ore prasthaan kiya
 After the Ashwamedha Yajna, during the Swayamvara period, when Sanyogita was looking at the kings present with a garland in her hand, she saw the statue of Prithviraj at the door
 sanyogita ne murti ke sameep ja kar varmala prithviraj kii murti ke kanth main pahana di
 At the same time, Ashwarudh Prithviraj entered Prasad
 unhone singhnaad ke saath sabhi raajaaon ko yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 After that, Indrapastha departed after taking Sanyogita
 maarg main jayachand ko parajeet kar ke, mohammad ghori ko bandi bana kar prithviraj sanyogita ke saath indrapastha pahunche
 Jaichand fought with Prithviraj to retaliate his insult
 parantu mohammad ghori ne jab janaa ki, prithviraj kannauj nagar ki ore ja rahe hai, tab prithviraj ko parajeet karne ke liye usne maarg main avrodh utpann kiya tha
 Prithviraj not only defeated Muhammad Ghori, but also took him as a prisoner and took him to Indraprastha
 prithviraj jab shakambhari ke singhaasana par arurh hue, tab chouhan vansh kaa samrajya ke saamanton kii sahaayta se chalata tha
 In the feudal system of governance, all the feudal lords manage their treasury independently and provide a fixed sum of money to their emperor as an annual gift
 yudhkaal main samant samraat ke aagyaanusaar apni sena bhi bhejte hai
 The state of political unity is highly relaxed in the feudal system of governance
 kyonki jo sainik samraat ke aadesh se yuddh ke liye udyukt hote hai, unki nishtha apane raja ke prati hoti he, na ki apane samraat ke prati
 Feudal also have their desires
 atah wein apane prabhaav ke or kshetra ke vistaar ke liye nirantar praytn sheel hote hai
 When the emperor of the feudal is defeated in a battle, is dead or weak, then the feudal begins to try for his freedom
 samrat kii shithilataa kaa kaaran jaan kar wein, apane samrat ke upar akraman karne ke liye bhi tatpar hote hai
 Prithviraj was young on the throne, so many feudal lords declared war on their dreams of independence
 parantu kaimaas or bhunakamall kii sahaayta se karpurdevi ne un vidrohi samanton kaa daman kar diya
 Thus Nagarjuna, the second son of Vigraharaj revolted as the heir to the kingdom of Ajayameru
 prithviraj jab sattarum hue, tab yoginipur main nagarjun nirvasit jivan vyateet kar rahe the
 At that time Yoginipur was ruled by Matul Tomarvanshi Prithvi Pal of Nagarjuna
 tomaravansheey raja prithvipal bhi chouhan vansh kaa ek samant tha
 In the seventh and seventh verses of the tenth canto of the Prithviraj Vijay epic, it is mentioned that the fortunate, mighty Vigraharaj invaded Gujpur by the prudent son Nagarjuna
 tomaravansheey raja prithvipal ke paas utani sainyashakti nahin thi, jisase vah prithviraj par akraman kar sake
 But Prithvipal was also supported by a feudal named Yadavvanshi Bhadanak
 phir bhi un donon kii sammilit sena bhi prithviraj ke 70,000 ashwarohi sainikon kaa, gajasainika kaa or padaation kaa saamana karne main asamarth thi
 Harihar Niwas Dwivedi is of the opinion that Jejakbhukti, the eastern reclusive kingdom of the Sapdalaksha kingdom and the kingdom of Kanyakubj also provided Prithvipal with military support to fight against Prithviraj
 shakambhari ke chouhan vansh kaa bayaanpradeshy yadavavanshiyon ko saath prapratham baar yuddh ajayraj ke kaal main hua thaa
 The fifteenth verse in the Bijaulia inscription mentions that Ajayraj was slaughtered by Srimarga and the heroes of Chachig, Singhul, and Yashodhar, etc
 during the campaign period of Durda Pradesh
 uske pashchaat arnoraaj or vigraharaj ne bhi bayaanpradeshy yadavavanshiyon ke saath kiye the
 But they did not succeed in completely destroying the Yadavas
 prithviraj ke viruddh yada nagarjun ne vidroh kiya, tababhadanak pradeshy raja sohanpal chouhan vansh ke viruddh yuddh karne ke liye sajj hua
 Therefore, he helped Nagarjuna with his military force
 sohanpal ke purvaj kumarpal ke saath vigraharaj ne yuddh kiya tha 
 The state of genetic warfare emerged in the reign of Prithviraj
 parantu prithviraj ne bhadanak pradesh ke yadavavanshiyon kaa samul uchhedan kar diya
 Prithviraj made two important changes in his system of governance after the invasion of Bhadanak region
 prapratham to honcipur ke samant ko padchyut karke apane bhai hariraj ko haansidurg ke samant ke rup main niyukt kiya
 In the second assignment, he appointed Govind in Prithipal's vacancy at Yoginipur
 evam yuddh ke mukhya do kendron kii paryaapt rakshan vyavastha karke apane virodhiyon ke shadyantra kaa pratyuttar dene ke liye prithviraj sajj ho gaye
 Information is obtainable on page 14 of the Khartargachhapattavali that, Prithviraj is famous in the Narayan region for the Digvijay campaign
 ) apni sena kaa sanghatan kiya
 Bhuvannackamall himself was guiding and operating the troops and officers
 prithvaaraj ne sainya sajjataa ke anantar shatru pradesh ke nirikshan ke liye bhuvanakamall ke netritv main ek dal ko aage bheja
 After that, with his generals, he started the Digvijay campaign with his huge army
 prithviraj ke senapatiyon main kaimaas or skanda pramukh the
 At that time major cities like Bayana, Alwar, Bhiwani, Rivadi etc
 used to be included in Bhadanak region
 us pradesh kii purv seemaa ke sameep main yamunanadi or dakshin seemaa ke sameep main chambalnadi pravaahit hoti thi
 Twenty-two km from the town called Bayana
 dur tribhuvangarh naamak nagar bhadaanak pradesh kii rajdhani tha
 Prithviraj invaded Bhadanak region from all directions
 us bhayankar yuddh main yadavavanshi sohanpal parajeet hua
 Prithviraj and his army established suzerainty over Sohanpal
 jo sainik jivit the, unho ne chambal nadi ko laangh kar shikohapashchaat nagar se baaise ki
me
 Started residence in a place called Bhadan
 us yuddh ke anantar sapadalaksh samrajya kii purvasimaa main yamunanadi or dakshinpurv disha main chambalnadi pravaahit hone lagi
 The description of the remarkable victory made over the Bhadanak region is attainable in the Khartargachhapattavali in this way - dipra praas prahar ghattatat prast muktavlibhih
nunan bhadanakiyain ranbhuvi karibhih swaastikeyury tochcheh
 Prithvirajasya Satyasubal Mahasah: Who himself is the alphabet 29॥ he prithviraj ! aapke parakram or yash kaa varnan kin shabd main kar sakate hai? jinaki sena ne chaaro disha se vijayadevi ko prasann kiya
 The one who established the dominance of the opponents with Arjun Bhujbal should have a swastika symbol
 jejakabhukti pradesh ke chedidesh, dasharn, jujhoti, kuntaldesh ityadi naamaantar bhi hai
 Sadly: Jejak Bhukthi region is known in the room of Bundelkhand
 yadhyapi bundelkhand kaa vishaal bhubhag madhyapradesh or uttarapradesh rajya ke madhya vibhakt ho gaya he, tathaapi vah pradesh bundelkhand naam se hi prasiddh he
 In that Bundelkhand, there was an independent kingdom called Jejakabhukti
 jejakabhukti pradesh kii uttar seemaa main yamunanadi, uttarpashchim disha main chambalnadi bahati thi
 Bundelkhand had a hill in the southeast direction
 jejakabhukti pradesh kii saanskrithik rajdhani khajuraho thi
 Jejajbhukti had two strategic centers in the state
 prapratham to mukhyarajdhani kalinger-nagar or dwitiya mahobagarh-nagar
 The creation of the Jejak bhakti state was very bizarre
 sarvatra laghu durg the
 Kalinjar, Ajaygarh, Barigarh, Mahoba, Madfa etc
 were important fortifications among them
 1182 varsh main prithviraj ne jejakabhukti par akraman kiya
 Enemies stunned by Prithviraj's invasion were defeated in battle
 pahujanadi ke tat par sthit sirsadurg main salkhan naamak senapati niyukt tha
 Kaimash killed him
 salkhan ke malakhan naamak ek bhai kaa bhi vadh kaimash ne kiya
 As soon as Prithviraj's army was marching towards a place called Akori, as soon as Sirsadurga, there was a fierce battle with Chandrerasena on the way
 aalha naamake paramardidev kaa yoddha us yuddh main parajeet hua
 So he took refuge in the forest
 brahmajit naamak yoddha us yuddh main hutatma hua
 After this, the invasion of Prithviraj led to the famous commander of Paramardidev
 swayan paramardidev chandel yuddh se vimukh ho kar kaalanzirdurg main guptavas karne laga
 But Prithviraj attacked Kalanjirdurg from all directions and forced Paramardidev to surrender
 prithviraj jab apni sena ke saath malwapradesh ke airan naamak sthaan ke paas sthit madanpur ke shibir main the, tabparamardidev ke aatmasamarpan kaa samachar unako mila
 It is mentioned in the Prabandhchintamana of Merutunga that, "paramardeva installed the trinity in his mouth, that is, by showing greatness, he got the living from Prithviraj"
 prithviraj ke jejakabhuktivijay kaa samarthan shilaalekh bhi karte hai
 Pillar: Shambhunitambaniprishnitu vigro na namargriha॥aस्माāmakam Paramardanosti Vadane Nyesten preserved: prithvirajennareshwaraditi trinan tatpattane poojyate
 shlo
 8, bhaag 1, sharngdharapaddatih That is, there is a melancholy in the worship of Shiva, there is no craving in Krishnarchan, do not bow down to Durgako, and the planet Vyagara in the form of a vidha whose our lord Paramardidev was installed in the trunk mouth succeeded in getting life from Narpati Prithviraj
 prithviraj kii jejakabhuktipradesh kaa abhiyaan safal hua
 But that campaign was incomplete
 kyonki jejakabhuktipradesh kii rani paramardidev kii putree nikidevi chalukyasamrat kii mulrajadwitiya kii mata tha
 Naikidevi Kushal was a political policy
 atah usne apane pita ke paraajay kii sthiti ko jaan kar prithviraj kaa dhyanchut karne ke liye ajayameru samrajya par akraman karavaaya
 In diplomacy, she became successful in her campaign
 yada prithviraj ne ajmeru samrajya ke upar akraman ke samachar sune, tabavah jejakabhuktipradesh ke anypradeshon kaa abhiyaan sthagig kar ajayameru pradesh kii ore chale gayi
 Prithviraj Raso Kavya mentions that Paramaradeva, who was defeated in the war, committed murder
 parantu 1201 varsh main likhaa paramardidev kaa antim shilaalekh praapt hota he
 So till that year, his life event is confirmed
 prithviraj ke pita someshwar ke shasankaal main chalukyavanshiy ajaypal se someshwar ne anek ksht sahe the
 Prithviraj's army invaded Abu Pradesh at night
 parantu us abhiyaan kaa netritv prithviraj nahin kar rahe the
 Because Prithviraj was in Bhandanakpradesh and Jejak Bhakti pradesh for the Digvijay campaign
 madanpur se praapt 1239 vikram sanvatsar main likhit shilaalekh api isaki pushti karata he
 According to the Khartargachhapattavali, Prithviraj had gathered his army at Narayankshetra to start Digvijayabhiyan in 1239 Vikram Samvatsar
 prithviraj yada jejakabhuktipradesh ke vijayabhiyaan main the, tab prithviraj ko dhyanchut karne ke liye chalukyavanshiy bhimdevdwitiya ne ajmeru samrajya ke upar akraman kiya tha
 In that invasion, Bhimdev II had established the suzerainty of the Sapalaksh empire
 chalukyavanshiyon ke us abhiyaan kaa netritv jagaddev naamak adhikari ne kiya tha
 But that success was very short-lived
 bikaner nagar ke aagneyakon main sthit chhapar gram se 22 kimi dur sthit charlugram se jo do shilaalekh praapt hue, un shilalekhon main nagauryuddh kaa vivaran praapt hota he
 There is 1241 Vikram Samvatsar in them
 tatra nagaur sangram main jo veergati ko praapt hue, unke smritichihn sthapit kiye gaye hai
 There is a mention of the treaty of Tatrapi Chauhan and Chalukya dynasty like Khartargachhapattavali
 ukt tathyon ke aadhaar se spasht he ki, chalukya ke do senapati jagaddev or dharavarsh ko praarambhik kaal main chouhan vansh ke viruddh sainya safalataa mili or sapadalakshasamrajya ke bhubhag par aadhipaty praapt karne main ve do safal bhi hue
 But after that, the long-term war with the Chauhan dynasty led to the condition of the treaty
 khartargachhpattavali main ullekh he ki, prithviraj ke saath dirghakalinyudh se senapati jagaddev vipadgrast ho gaya tha
 Therefore, he made a treaty with Prithviraj
 jagaddev kisi bhi prakaar se prithviraj ke saath sandhi-satatya chahta tha
 The compulsion related to the treaty of Jagaddev can be known most often by a phenomenon described in Khartargachhapattavali
 khartargachhpattavali ke 43 prishth par likhaa he ki, 1244 vikram sanvatsar main sapadalakshasamrajya ke kuch shreshthi gujarat rajya gaye the
 Then Dandanayak named Abhayad planned to loot them
 apane dal ko bhi usne lunthankarya ke liye sajj kar diya
 But to do so much importance, permission of the Prime Minister is necessary, thinking that he wrote a letter to Jagaddev
 abhi yahan sapadalakshasamrajya ke dhanik shreshthion kaa ek mandal aayaa hua he
 With your permission can i loot them and make money? itnaa padhte hi jagaddev krodh se ugr ho uththe
 He wrote a response that, maine bahut ksht se abhi abhi prithviraj ke saath sandhi karne main safalataa praapt kii he
 Therefore, i warn you that, if you have afflicted any of the people of Sapalaksha, then i will sew you in the belly of the donkey
 ukt patr ko padh kar dandanayak ne un shreshthion kaa yogya satkar kar sakushal bhej diya
 Veravalprashasti also confirms this statement of Khartargachhapattavali
 jejakabhuktipradesh main yada prithviraj ne vijay praapt kii, tabanikidevi ke aadesh se chalukyavanshiy raja bhimdev ne ajayameru pradesh ke upar akraman kiya tha
 Therefore, Prithviraj Jejakabhukti had gone to war with the Chalukyan dynasty by postponing the Vijayabhayan of the other state
 prithviraj or bhimdev ke madhya dirghakaal paryant yuddh hua
 The war came to an end with the victory of Prithviraj in 1244 Vikram Samvatsar
 khartagargachhpattavali kaa vivaran, jaisalmer, nagaur, barmer or jodhpur se praapt shilaalekh or verawalprashasti prithviraj or bhimdev ke madhya ke yuprinaam kii paryaapt soochna dete hai
 Prithviraj Raso Kavya mentions that Prithviraj killed Bhimdev II
 parantu yadhyapi 1192 varsh main prithviraj kii mrityu ho gai thi, tathaapi bhimvedav dwitiya kii sthiti 1238 paryant thi aisa pramaanon se siddh hota he
 In 1175, Mohammad Ghori established the suzerainty over Multan, and in the same year he had established dominance over Uchha region
 uske pashchaat i
 1182 varsh main dakshin sindh pradesh ke upar akraman karke shaniah shaniah usne sindhupradesh par swadhipaty sthapit kiya
 From that, the extent of the kingdom of Sapadalakshtra and that of Sandhya Pradesh ruled by Ghori became the same
 evam ghori prithviraj kaa prativeshi or shatru ban baitha
 They both had their own reasons for hostility
 prithviraj apane pradesh kaa siimaarakshan karnaa chaahate the, parantu uske liye turk ke akrantaon ko peeche hataanaa anivaary tha
 On the other hand in the expansionary policy of Ghori, Prithviraj Kantak was similar
 kyonki bharat pradesh par sattavistaar ke liye prithviraj kaa ant hi ghori kaa lakshya tha
 It is mentioned in Prithvirajvijay that, in the northwestern direction, which is a state famous for the horses, the king of that region resides in the roaring country named Molechh Ghori
 turk deshiy us gaumansabhakshan karne vaale ke vishay main sun kar prithviraj ne mlecchon ke naash kii pratigya lee
 Ghori also knew about the promise of Mlachnash by Prithviraj
 atah usne i
 1177 varsh main ajayameru durg main apana doot bheja
 Thereafter, Takla envoy appeared in the Rajya Sabha of Ajayameru
 yada wo doot ajmeruprasaad main upasthit tha, tabaprasaad main nagarjunaman kaa utsav chal rahaa tha
 In order to write the praise of Kapilavadha by the creator, his forehead has been composed, etc
 From the sentences, the flat tuck of that messenger is derided in the epic of Prithviraj Vijay
 prithvirajvijay main aage ullikh he ki, uski daadhi ke, bhruvon ke or palak ke kesh uske pradesh kii drakshavat shwet varniya the
 His idols were destroyed
 arthath wo murdhanyavarnon ke uccharan main asamarth tha
 Therefore, his language was getting geniused under the tweet of the parties
 uski tvak kushtarogiwat dikh rahi thi
 He wore the strange clothes of Krishnavarna
 iske pashchaat prithvirajvijay mahakavy main kuch shloke praapt nahin hote
 Therefore, the purpose of the messenger's presence in Ajayameru's presidency is certainly not known
 parantu doot ke vachan sunakar prithviraj ne yada pratyuttar diya, ve shloke uplabdh hai
 Hearing the words of the messenger, Prithviraj had a terrible reaction
 atyant krodh se ucch swar main prithviraj ne bolaa, "main use kya boluun? wo nishchay se jaanata he ki, maine uske sadrush narbhakshak kii hatya karne ke liye hi vijayabhiyaan kaa armbh kiya he
 Even knowing this, he sends messengers to me, whom people refer to as "ajayameru's lion"
 prithviraj ke ukt krodhpurna vachan se ghori ke sandesh kaa anumaan hi kar sakate hai
 Historians believe that Ghori would have sent a message to Prithviraj either for surrender or for a treaty, as was the political situation in that period
 ghori ke darp se purna prastaav sunakar prithviraj ne us prastaav ko asweekaar kiya hoga, kyonki chouhan vansh kaa or prithviraj kaa swabhimaan se vipareet sandesh hoga
 Along with the changed political equation of Prithviraj's Sapadalakshsamrajya and the boundary of Sindhupradesh, the political importance of Vikampur was also increased
 kyonki vikampur kii seem ke saath hi sindhu or sapadalaksh pradeshon kii seemaa sammilat hoti thi
 In this way, the western part of Vikam Pradesh began to touch the boundary of Sindhupradesh and the former part of Sapalakshpradesh us samay vikampur main lodravavansh kaa shashan tha
 In the said political equation, the king of Jaisal, the Lodava dynasty, assisted Raja Ghori by sacrificing national interest
 kyonki ghori ke samarthan se hi lodravavansh ko shashan prapt hua tha
 How much Prithviraj fought with Ghori is disputed
 kyonki vibhinn aitihaasik sahitya main vibhinn yudhsaikhyaayein pradutt hai
 But the description of their fierce war is available everywhere
 narin kaa pratham yuddh or narin kaa dwitiya yudhm to prasiddh hi hai
 The first war took place in the year 1191 AD and the second war was in the year 1992 AD
 pratham yuddh main prithviraj kii vijay hui or dwitiya main prithviraj kii paraajay
 Prithviraj Raso is mentioned in the poem that, Prithviraj passed and punished Ghori thrice
 prithviraj ne ghori ko saat baar bandi kiya tha aisa hammirmahakavy main praapt hota he
 It is mentioned in the Prabandhak that Prithviraj had arrested and released Ghori twenty times
 surjancharitamahakavy ke anusaar ikkis baar prithviraj ne ghori ko dand diya tha
 According to the Prabandhchintamani text, twenty-three times Prithviraj left Ghori alive
 ghori ke saath prithviraj ke jitne yuddh hue, unke pramaan anuplabdh hai
 Therefore, the dispute regarding the definite number remains unchanged
 parantu itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, prithviraj or ghori ko madhya anek baar gharshan hue the
 Somewhere small friction is bad
 sabhi gharshan main prithviraj kii hi vijay hui thi
 So the number is unclear, but the certainty of Prithviraj's victory has been shown everywhere
 antim yuddh main arthath narin ke dwitiya yuddh main prithviraj kii paraajay hui thi
 The battle of Sutlej was Prithviraj's first war with Ghori
 us yuddh main ghori kii ghorparaajay hui thi
 In the battle that followed the defeat of Ghori, the feudal kingdom called Paramaravanshi Sura used to go to Ghazni region every year
 satlujayuddh kaa vivaran bahutra praapt nahin hota, atah prithviraj ke ghori ke saath do yuddh hi hue ye bhramana he
 The inscription of Phalvardhika confirms the description of the Sampraana Sutlejuddha
 satluj yuddh ke vishay main hammir mahakavy ke tritiyasarg main ullekh miltaa he
 King Prithviraj once sat in the Rajya Sabha while ruling justly
 usee samay chandraraj naamak koi raja prithviraj ke sammukh upasthit hua
 He was the head of the kings of Chandra Raja Paschidisha
 ve rajagan bhaybheet or nirutsahit the
 Because Ghori named Yanavaraja had been attacking other territories to nurture his policy of expansion
 us yanvaraja se parrast pashchimdisha ke sabhi raja prithviraj se sahaayta kii apeksha rakhte the
 Prithviraj saw the hanging face and asked the reason for the tribulation
 chandraraj bolaa, "he rajan! pashchimdisha se ghori naamak yavanraaja anya samrajyon ko padakrant karte hue anek rajyon kaa sarvanaash kar chukaa he
 All the cities of that state which he invaded, were plundered and temples were destroyed
 rajyon kii strion balaatkaar kiye gaye, uski krurta ke kaaran un mahilaon kii sthiti ati dayaneey ho chuki he
 Any Rajput whom he sees armed sends him to Yamlok
 sadyah ghori kii rajdhani multan pradesh he
 " chandraraj kaa vachan sun kar prithviraj krodhi hokar khadey hue or bole, After that, Prithviraj with great pride caressed the mustache with his lips
 pashchaat prithviraj ne chaturangini sen ke saath multan pradesh par akraman kar diya
 Prithviraj had a battle with Ghori in a huge plot between Vikampur and Uchh Pradesh
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, vah yuddh 1182-83 varsh main hua hoga
 Since that war took place on the arrow of river Sutlej, hence the name of that war was called Sutlej war
 prithviraj kii vishalsena ke akraman se ghori kii sena yuddh se palaayan kar gai
 Prithviraj made Ghori a prisoner
 ghori kii dayaneey sthiti hammirmahakavy main spashtatya varnit nahin he
 But there it is mentioned that, before Prithviraj, Natmastak Ghori became independent, sometimes he made the choice to give annual tax to Prithviraj
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, prithviraj ne rashtrasankat ko dhyaan main rakhte huue pratikar kiya or ghori ke saath yuddh kaa nirnay liya tha
 The consequences of that war were frightening for Ghori
 kyonki us yuddh ke pashchaat ghori prithviraj kaa karadaata ban gaya tha
 On the orders of Prithviraj, a feudal named Parmavanshi Sur used to accept the Ghazni region every year
 ek baar ekaaki sur ko dekh kar turki logo ne use maar daalaa
 But Sur 74 Turk died by killing soldiers
 sur kii mrityu ke pashchaat prithviraj ne pratapsingh naamak adhikari ko kar lene ke liye niyukt kiya 
 But Pratap Singh was not loyal and pious
 vah turk-deshiyon kaa das tha
 From the Ghazni region, who used to go to the treasury of Prithviraj in the form of Dhan Kar, used to donate a large part of that wealth to the 'masjid' in Pratap Singh Marg itself and to the temples there
 koi bhi yadi daan ke vishay main kuch bhi puchhata tha, tarhi vah kahata tha ki, prithviraj ke visham grahadosh nivaaran ke liye daan de rahaa hoon
 
 prithviraj ne anek baar ghori ko bandi bana kar apamaanit kiya
 Prithviraj used to accept the annual tax as punishment from Ghori every year
 prithviraj ke kargrahan kii pushti shilalekha bhi karte hai
 Many Persian poets produced confusion about Prithviraj's tax acceptance, but the inscription named Phalvardhika from the state of Rajasthan confirms the incident of taxation of Prithviraj
 falvarddhika naamak sthal par sthit falaudidevi ke mandir ke jirnoddhar samay par us shilaalekh kii sthapana hui thi
 The inscription was installed on Thursday, 1555 on the Shuklaikadashi of the Chaitramas of Vikram Samvatsar
 dahaladesh ke adhipati parmarvansheey raja madhudev tha
 On the orders of his famous son Sur Prithviraj, he used to go to Gajni region every year to accept the annual punishment
 ek baar vah ekaaki hi kar lene gazani chalaa gaya
 Ghori's troops attacked the lonely Sur
 yoddha sur ne 74 yawanon ko markar ant main praan tyaage
 Nagarjuna was suppressed by Prithviraj in the year 1177, then there was a celebration in Ajmeru Prasad after Tabanagarjun Daman
 us utsav main ghori ne prithviraj ko sandhi yaa samarpan ke liye doot bheja tha
 Yada Ghori had sent an envoy to the Sapadalakshsamrajya, only then he had plans to aggress on the state of Gujarat
 atah uski ichha thi ki, chalukyavanshiyon kii or chouhan vanshiyon kii jo shatruta he, use aadhaar bana kar chouhan vansh ke saath milakar gujarat rajya par akraman kiya jaaen
 But on opposing Prithviraj, Ghori himself came out to attack Gujarat
 ekvarsh tak apane sainyavistaar kii niti par kaary karke usne 1178 varsh main gujarat par akraman kiya
 But the state of Gujarat used to have a good state
 atah usne pehle uchh pradesh par akraman kiya
 Ghori, who reached India from Multan region, wanted to attack the Uchchha region
 parantu uchhpradesh ke rajputon se vah bhaybheet ho gaya
 Ghori's victory was impossible before the Rajputs
 atah usne kapat se uchhpradesh par aadhipaty kii yojana banaai
 Ghori came to know from intelligence that the relationship of the king of Uchha Pradesh with his rajni is not simple, that is, his relationship is bitter
 atah ghori ne raji ko sandesh bheja
 In that message he wrote that, "if you kill your husband with poison, then i will marry you"
 ghori ke sandesh ke pratyuttar main raji ne likhaa, "main to prauji ho chali hoon
 What will i do by getting married? But if you marry my daughter, i can do your due work
 raji ke pratyuttar paakar ghori ne anukshan apana sammati patr bheja
 Because his purpose was to establish dominance over the northern region
 vivaahadi kaa vishay to uske kapat kaa keval bhaag tha
 Thereafter, the queen of Uttar Pradesh killed her husband with poison
 durg, koshagaar or shastraagaar ko taala markar uski chaabi ghori ko bhijwa di
 Thus, through deceit and deceit, Ghori became the ruler of the state
 ghori yada uchh pradesh kaa adhipati hua, tabausane uchhpradesh kii raji or rajkumaari ko gazani pradesh bhej diya
 When the princess came to know about her mother's act, she scorned her mother
 apane aacharan ke prati doshabhav or putree kii ghrinaa ke kaaran raji ne apane praan tyaag diye
 After that, the princess also gave up her body after suffering the misery of the world
 dow habibullah kaa mat he ki, uchhpradesh main bhattirajaaon ke shashan kaa pramaan nahin he
 Hence, the creators of Ibn Asir, Yehia Sarhindi, Nizamuddin Ahmed, Farista etc
 have called this event Kalpinik
 parantu ghori ne uchhpradesh par kapat se aadhipaty jamaaya is vishay par sabhi itihasvid sammat hai
 Ghori looted the temple of Someshwaramhadev, situated at a place called Kiradu, en route to obtaining sovereignty over Uttar Pradesh
 shiv ke wo mandir us samay rajasthanrajya main prasiddh tha
 Ghori proceeded towards the state of Gujarat by looting the grand temple which was decorated with Sundararatnas and completely destroyed that temple
 va sanderao pradesh se hote hue nadoliya ke chouhan vanshiyon kii nadol naamak rajdhani par upar akraman kiya
 At that time, the king of the feudatory Klahanvans of Chalukyavansho was ruling Nadol region
 rajasthan main sthit us nadol nagar main turk-sainiko dwaara mandiron ko agnisaat kiya gaya or nagarikon ko lut liya gaya
 Prithviraj got the news of the downfall of Nadol city by Ghori

 He was adorned with arms with his soldiers

 No mlechha from outside can attack India and kill the identity of India
 atah hamen ] ko sainya sahaayta deni chaiye"
 But pacifying the wrath of young Prithviraj, Mandaleshwar Kaimas of Sapadalaksha Empire presented his diplomatic interpretation

 Hey Rajan! Anger is not right at this time

 Camels should also eat, why should the eagle wipe on such a snake? That is, this opportunity has come spontaneously, our opponents will fight their mutual power and weaken their power and strength
 apane tark ko pusht karne ke liye kaimaas ne sundope or sund naamak rakshason or tilottama kii puranic katha sunai
 As two Asura brothers named Sundop and Sandak were destroyed in the beauty of Tilottama by enamored internecine warfare, and their intention was that they would perish
 kaimaas kii is rajnatik tark kii sabhi itihasvidon ne ninda kii he
 Because thinking about his country, the young Prithviraj, after counting his problem with the Chalukyas as a householder, was ready to help the state of Gujarat
 parantu kaimaas ke jatiltark main bhrant yuva prithviraj us praant par ho rahe akraman ke drashtaa hi bane rahe
 Some historians say that, if Prithviraj would have assisted the state of Gujarat at that time, that is, had symbolized the attack on the state of Gujarat, then the situation of present-day India and present-day India would have been different
 nadol ke durg par apana aadhipaty prasthaapit kar or sampoorn nadol nagar ko lut kar ghori mirpur se sebadi main sthit hastikundi sthaan ke mandiron ko bhi lutata hua jhalody naamak sthal pahunchaa
 Thereafter reached Kasahrad located near the Abu ranges

 Minhaj mentions in a book entitled Tabakate Nasiri that, "bhimdev II was the king of the state of Gujarat at that time
 " is kathan kaa hi andhanukaran kuch parvarti lekhakon ne kiya
 But the archival witness proves that at that time the king of Gujarat state was Moolraj II
 ghori kii sena ke saath gujarat rajya kii vishalsena kaa yuddh hua
 In that war, the army of Gujarat State defeated turki-sena
 bahut turki sainik maare gayi, kuch rankshetra kaa tyaag karke bhaag bhi gaye
 It is mentioned in the book 'tarikhe Farishta' that Ghori somehow escaped from the battlefield while protecting his life
 sundhalekh kaa nirmaan 1319 vikram sanvatsar main hua
 The description of the defeat of Turushaka by Kelhan and Kirtipala is also found in that sundial inscription
 prithviraj vijay mahakavy me ullekh milita he ki, gujarat rajya kii vijay ke samachar dene ke liye gujarat rajya se ek doot sapadalaksh pahucha tha
 In front of Prithviraj, he explained in full detail the defeat of Turushaka
 prithviraj ne doot kaa uchit sammaan kiya or jane kii anumati di
 After that, Prithviraj made his minister aware about the national policy
 prithviraj ne kaimaas ko apni rashtraniti ke gyanavikas ke liye spashtshabd main paraamarsh diya
 Historians are of the opinion that in the middle of 1191–1192, the vast empire like Sapadalaksha was defeated by the invasion of the Turks
 uske pichhe kaimaas kii asafal kootneeti hi karanbhoot thi
 Just like Mahmud Ghaznavi attacked the state of Gujarat 150 years ago and looted the state of Gujarat, so was Ghori's Ipsa
 parantu abu parvatamala ke tal main ghori kii ghorparaajay hui
 Historians are of the opinion that Ghori's comparison with Mahmud Ghaznavi is unfit
 kyonki gaznavi kii yoddha buddhi sankatkaal main ati prakhar ho jaati thi
 Unlike him, Ghori Ghori was dissolute, sly and insidious by nature
 usne jitne yaddh jite, unamem usne kapat kaa hi maarg apanaaya
 Ghori, who was defeated in the state of Gujarat, invaded the Lahore region in the year 1182–83
 uske pashchaat ghori ke samrajya kii seemaa panjabrajya kii antimanadi ke sameep main arthath satlujanadi ke sameep main aa pahunchi
 From Sutlejanadi, the border of the Sapradalakshtra kingdom started from the other coast
 sarhind or farista ne samadalakshasamrajya ke pratham sainya awaas ko 'tapahinda' se sambodhit kiya he
 The union of Ghori's empire with the boundary of the Sapadalaksa Samajya led to a state of friction
 uske pashchaat satlujayuddh kaa yuddh hua, jis main ghori kii paraij hui
 Where did Prithviraj fight with Ghori? Scholars differ in this matter
 minhaj siraaj ne yudhakshetra kaa naam narin bataaya he
 The date of the battlefield is written in the Tarhe Farishta text
 anyatra uskaa kathan he ki, tarin ut taraayan abhi taravadi naam se prasiddh he
 Dr
 Khalik Ahmad Nizami and Dr
 Habibullah have both supported the angel book
 kyonki un donon ke mat hai ki, mudrak ke dosha se taraayan ke sthaan par narin ho gaya
 The 'tarayan' area that Dr
 Habibullah supports is 14 miles south of Thaneswar
 parantu us ke matanusaar toravana naamak sthal taraayan yuddh kshetra tha
 That Toravana region is a place adjacent to the subdivision called Kalanwat of Sirsamandal in the state of Rajasthan
 dow habibullah kaa matadhar general kaningham kaa granth he
 In the 'archaeological Survey of India', General Cunningham wrote that, the Tarain war took place in a place 27 miles away from Bathinda
 vah sthaan sadyah toravana naam se prasiddh he
 The basis of the area which Cunningham has talked about in the middle of Bhatinda and Sirsa Jallay is the book called 'yahiya Sirhindi'
 yahia sarhindi naamak lekhak ne 'tarikhe mubarakashahi' naamak pustak main ullikhit kiya he ki, khittaye surasuti kaa yuddh tarinashetra main hua tha
 'date Mubarak Shahi' has been edited by Shamsulumma Muhammad Hidayat Hussain on the basis of people's handiwork, some of them are also in Azamgarh district of Rajasthan state
 azamgarh zille kii darul-musannaphin-sthaan ke tino hastpratiyon main se ek main "khitatye sarasuti" ke sthaan par keval "sarasuti", "mentarin" ke sthaan par "tarai" hi mudrit kiya gaya he
 In fact, that war was the only Narayan region
 tabakaate nasiri or tarikhe-mubaratshahi kaa bhi yahi mat he
 In the pure printed historical text of 'yahiya Sirhindi', the battle took place in Narayankshetra, situated in the 'terai' on the arrow of Saraswatini
 farsibhasha ke mulpath main kahin bhi dosha nahin he, parantu aangal anuwaad dekhakar yaa agyaanavash ye dosha pravisht hua he
 Thus a dispute arose regarding the battlefield
 itihasvidon kii charchaa kaa nishkarsh he ki, prithviraj kaa ghori ke saath yuddh narineshetra main hi hua tha 
 It is strongly supported by many historians
 un main pro es ech hodivaala bhi antarbhoot hote hai 
 Therefore, from the geographical and historical facts, the name of the battlefield was Narayan
 kyonki taravadi ye sthalan narineshetra se samipatam sthal he, atah narin-taravadi-yuddh bhi kaha jaataa he hai
 The knowledge of Torwana Sthal in the district of Sirsa as a Narayan battlefield was the result of misleading references
 dilli se narineshetra 135 ki
me dur he, thaneshwar se narineshetra 21 ki
me dur he
 This has also been mentioned in the book 'date Farishta'
 kaningham dwaara ullikhit toravana-sthal dilli se 342 kimi dur he, atah bhugolic vivaran anusaar bhi general kaningham kii soochna mathyaa siddh hoti he
 From 1175 to 1191, Ghori made many attacks in the neighboring regions of India and in Indian states
 1190 varsh main narin kaa pratham yuddh hua tha
 Ghori was defeated in that war and Prithviraj also made Ghori a point
 ghori ne 1190 varsh main pratham baar suniyojit rup se sapadalaksh samrajya ke upar akraman kiya tha
 Ghori attacked the Sarhind-site of Sapradalakasamrajya by crossing the Sutlej river
 sarhind ke durg ke sainiko dwaara ghori kaa pratikar kiya gaya, parantu ghori ne u durg par aadhipaty sthapit safalataa paali
 Ghori Ziauddin Tolki ruled over the fort of Sirhind and established his dominion and went back to Gajni state
 jiyauddin tolki ne 'tabakaate nasiri' naamak pustak ke lekhak minhaj ke chachaa kaa putr tha
 Regarding his brother, Minhaj has written that, Ghori had appointed 12,000 cavalry soldiers to protect the fort
 'tarikhe farista' naamak pustak main ashwarohion kii sankhya 1040 praapt hoti he 
 When Prithviraj got the news of the attack on the fort of Sirhind, he proceeded to the state of Sirhind with his feudatories
 prithviraj kii sena main 2,00,000 ashvorohi or 3,000 hathi the
 It is mentioned in the angel book that, Prithviraj started the yatra with the Vishalsena towards Sirhind state
 When it became known to Ghori, he too started the journey towards Sirhind with a huge force
 sadyah jo sthal 'taravadi' naam se prasiddh he, wo sthal tab narin tha, us kshetra main donon senaaon ke madhya main bheeshan yuddh hua tha
 Narration's description of the war is found in a book called 'farishta'
 vahaan ullikhit ha ki, rajputon kii vyuhabaddh vishalsena ko jab ghori ne dekha, tab vah bhi apni sena ko vyuhabaddh karne ke liye sena ko teen bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya
 Seeing the army of Rajputs, Ghori's mind became enlightened
 paraajay ke bhay se usne sheeghra hi apni sena ko teen bhaag main vibhajit kiya kyonki rajputon kii sena ke teen bhaag the
 The army of the central division was led by Ghori
 teen bhaago main vibhakt prithviraj kii sena main madhyabhaag kii gajasena prabal akraman karne ko sajj thi
 The main responsibility of the invasion in Prithviraj's army was that of the cavalry
 ashwarohi sena ke prishth main teen vibhaag main vibhakt talavaardhari sainik or shuldhari sainik the
 In the middle of Padati and Gajasena was Bhattarakaparameshwara as the commander
 vahi apane priyagaj par arurh bharateshwar prithviraj yuddh kaa netritv kar rahe the
 When the army was divided into three parts to symbolize its enemies, the responsibility of fierce attack against the army was left and south
 samartantra ke bhaag rup senapati asi vyuharachna banaate hai
 The two armies started fighting towards each other
 sarvapratham prithviraj ke prishthbhag kii ashwarohinee sena ne ghori kii vambhag or dakshinbhaag kii sena par akraman kar diya
 Ghori's soldiers were not powerful in tolerating that deadly attack
 atah praanon kii raksha ke liye sena ke madhyabhaag kii ore palaayan karkane lage
 Thus Turaksena's array collapsed
 ghori ke sabhi vibhaag mishrit ho chuke the
 Many paramilitary were killed by the destruction of that array
 rajputon ke akraman se turksena ke diggaj sainik bhi rankshetra ko tyaag kar palaayan kar gayi
 After the beginning of the war Ghori went towards the feudal Govind of Dehli Pradesh
 ghori ko apni ore aate dekh govind bhi uske saath yoddh karne ke liye aage gayi
 Then both of them fought
 ghori ne govind ke upar apane shul se prahaar kiya
 That shul entered the mouth of Govind
 shulprahaar se govind ke daant bhi gir gayi
 Shul entered from the mouth of Govind and went to the gorge
 uske pashchaat govind ne bhi pratiprahaar kiya
 Govind struck Ghori's arm with a stroke of his prick
 wo aghat ati shaktishaalee tha
 Frightened Ghori changed the direction of his horse and fled the battlefield
 parantu aahat ghori bhoomi par gir gaya
 Ghori was taken captive by the Rajput soldiers
 is prakaar prithviraj ne turk sainiko par purnatah aadhipaty sthapit kar liya
 Minhaj's book mentions that Prithviraj made Ghori a prisoner
 uske pashchaat ghori dwaara kshamaa yachana karne par prithviraj ne turk ke sainiko ke saath ghori ko mukt kar diya
 Ghori's army was not massacred during Prithviraj's victory
 prithviraj ne sabhi sainiko ko sakushal turk kii ore bhej diya tha
 This generosity of Prithviraj has been criticized by Indian nationalist historian Devara Katu
 itihasvidon ke matanusaar narin ke dwitiya yuddh main prithviraj kii paraajay kaa mukhyatam kaaran ghori kii mukti thi 
 Historian Dr
 Bindhyanath Chauhan says that slaughter of a refugee is prohibited in Indian culture
 parajeet sena ke aahat sainiko par hatyachaar bhartiya yuddh parampara ke anugun anuchit tha
 Because in Manusmriti it is said that - na bhitan na paraavrittan sataan dharmamanusmaran
 7
93 manusmriti
 That is, slaughter of those whose weapons have been destroyed, who are being consumed by mourning, who are seriously hurt, who are afraid, who are sailing with war
 pratham narinyuddh main ghori kii paraajay ke anantar prithviraj ke aadesh se mukt kiya gaya ghori lahore gaya
 There his soldiers were waiting for him
 lahore pradesh main ghori do maas tak rukaa
 Because the disease was necessary for the physical body of Ghori hurt in war
 do maas ghori dwaara lahore durg kaa navnirmaan bhi karavaaya gaya
 Thereafter, he went to Ghazni region with his army
 isami ke kathananusaar gazani pradesh pahuchakar ghori ne gaznavi-vansh ke khushro malik naamak raja or uske putr ko mrityudand diya
 Ghori reached Gajni state and punished the soldiers who had fled the battlefield in the first battle of Narayan
 'farista' naamak pustak main ullekh he ki, ghori jab gazani pradesh pahucha, tab usne afganpradeshy sainiko ko to peeda nahin di, parantu ghori-vansheey, khurasaani-vansheey or khalji-vansheey sainiko kaa apmaan karke unako dand diya
 Ghori tied the city full of unruly young men in the face of those soldiers and marched them
 ghori kaa aadesh tha ki, jo sainik syut se apakv yavon ko na khaaen, unke shir sharir se pruthak kiye jaayen
 Ghori's mood during the Narayan war was filled with depression, tribulation and self-aggression
 tabakaate nasiri or tarikhe farista ityadi granthon main ullekh he ki, ghori itnaa duhkhi ho gaya tha ki, usne ann or jal kaa bhi tyaag kar diya tha
 Day and night he kept burning in the fire of his defeat
 vah apni patni ke paas bhi shayan nahin karata tha
 After this, Ghori again got embellished for the war with the inspiration of her mother
 
 Once Ghori was sitting with Aibak reviewing the defeat in the Narayan war
 tab ghori ko aibak ne kaha, hamaare ashv uttam hai, parantu bhartiya hathion ke mukh dekhakar ve bhaybheet ho jate the
 Because he had never experienced war with Indian elephants before
 atah bhartiya hathion ke sameep ve bhaybheet the
 This is the main reason why we were defeated in front of the Indian Army
 apane paraajay ke kaaran ko ko jaanakar ghori ne agrim yuddh ke purv ashv prashikshan kaise karnaa chaiye? iskaa bhi upaay abak ko kaha
 He said, make weapons out of wet clay and wood
 un hathion ko vaise hi sajaao, jaise bhartiya hathi saje hote hai
 After that, make the horses fearless by making a situation of war by the cavalry around those elephants
 is prakaar yuddh samay main bhartiya hathion ke sammukh upasthit ho te hue bhi ashv nirbhik ho kar unka pratikar karne main sakasham ho jaayenge
 As advised by Ghori, Aibak underwent horse training
 vah swayan bhi yuddh sambaddh nition ko rachane laga
 He created a mobile-military contingent
 us sachal dal kaa mukhya kaary tha ki, yuddh ke samay yadi kisi vyuh ke sainik durbal ho jaaen, tarhi yah dal yuddh kshetra main ek dal se apper dal main jaakar yuddh kar sake
 In this way, if the strength of any party in the war zone is weakened, then this team can balance its force in the war zone by helping that additional team
 ashv par arurh hue sainik baan chalaane main bhi sakasham hone chaiye, atah abak dwaara apane sainikon ko prashin diya gaya tha
 The description of Aibak's strategy is not found in the Persian-language historical literature, but it is mentioned in the book of the famous war scientist A
 A
 Smail
 isami dwaara likhit phutuhussalatin naamak pustak main ek kavach kaa bhi varnan praapt hota he
 The name of that armor was 'karva'
 vah kavach belon ke charm se nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Cotton or wool was installed on both sides of that armor
 bhartiya sena yada turk kii sena ke padaati par prahaar karen, tab ve turk sainik aahat na ho jaye ye us kavach nirmaan kaa uddeshy tha
 Thus Ghori, together with Aibak, formulated a proactive policy and defensive policy
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, ghori kii sena main afgaan sena, turk sena, tajik sena or tulak sena ke vibhinn senapati the
 The names of some generals are found in a book called Futuhussalatin
 yatha – 1
 Kharbak - It had a demon-like body
 ye agrim dal kaa senapati tha
 2
 Alba - was the commander of the left department army
 3
 mukalba – kendriya sena kaa yoddha tha
 4
 Kharmel - was a warrior of the Central Army
 5
 kutbuddin aibak – sena kii sampoorn satta kaa mahaprabandhak tha
 It always remained near Ghori in the battlefield
 6
 tazuddin yalduj – kisi dal kaa senapati tha
 7
 Nasiruddin Kubacha - He was leading the haraval-dal
 8
 mohammad bin mahmud – ye bakhtiyaar khalji kaa chachaa tha
 It was a committed and skilled commander
 ye sabhi senapati ran kshetra main sena kaa sanchaalan karne main daksh the
 Except for Ghori's army, these generals also had their own personal army
 minhaj ke kathanananusaar ghori dwaara bharat yatra ke kuch samay purv hi tulaki ke aagrah se tulak-vanshiyon ke 12,000 ashwarohi ko apni sena main samavisht kar diye the 
 1191 Tame Varsha Ghori, in particular: Bharat per Yatram
 peshawar pradesh or multan pradesh hote hue ghori lahore pradesh pahunchaa
 Ghori also started a conspiracy against Prithviraj by staying in the fort of Lahore
 ek ore vah apane sainya vyavasthaapan, sainya prashikshan or guptchar bhejne ke kaary main vyast tha, duusari ore usne apane doot ko ajayameru durg bheja
 Although he knew what Prithviraj would reply to his letter, he sent the messenger to the fortress of Ajayameru
 kyonki vah keval samay vyateet karnaa chahta tha
 His aim behind that was, his army could be equipped for war and allied loyalty could be tested again
 ghori kaa doot prithviraj ke sammukh upasthit hua
 He read the letter provided by Ghori
 us patr main ullikhit tha ki, prithviraj ! apane kaanon main paradheenata kaa aabhushan pahan kar mere prasaad upasthit ho kar tum islam-dharm kaa angikaar karo 
 Other Persian writers have also supported the said statement
 farista main milita he ki, ghori apni sena ke saath lahore pradesh pahunchaa, tab kwamulmulk rukunuddin hamja ne ajayameru durg ko apana sandesh dene ke liye bheja tha
 In it, the message "king should follow Islam" was written
 farista naamak granth main ullikhit he ki, prithviraj ne yada doot ke mukh se sandesh suna, tabaunhone islam-dharm ke liye abhadra bhashaa kaa upyog kiya
 Prithviraj had also uttered abuses to the kings followers of Islam
 phir kwamulmulk ko waapas bhej diya tha
 In the year 1990, after defeating Ghori, Prithviraj's empire was counted as the main power of India
 prithviraj ke samarthy se virodhiyon ke hriday main shoolaghatavat peeda utpann hone lagi
 Those kings who were defeated by Prithviraj were ready to take the opportunity to strike Prithviraj
 jammu pradesh kaa raja vijayadev ghori kaa pramukh sahaayak ban baitha
 In Prabandhasagraha and Prithviraj Raso Kavya, mentions of the help of Ghori of Jammupathi are received
 nayachandra suri ne apane pustak main likhaa ha ki, jammupradesh ke raja ne apane putr narsinghdev ko apni sena ke saath narineshetra main bheja tha
 The historian named The Hague has mentioned in his book that, all the kings of India were present in the second war of Naranaya, but even to protect national independence, King Jayachand of Kannauj region did not help his son Prithviraj
 usne narin ke pratham yuddh main bhi yuddh nahin kiya
 It was due to the defeat of Prithviraj in the Second World War of Narayan that the position of Muslim power in India became stronger, because Jaichand made a treaty with the commoners
 jems tod ke matanusaar kannauj pradesh ke raja jayachand or patan pradesh ke raja ne prithviraj ke samoolnaash ke liye mohammad ghori ko aamantran diya tha 
 King Chandel of Jejakabhukti Pradesh was also an ally of Ghori
 jesalmer pradesh kaa shalivahanabhaati-vansh to ghori ke aashirwad se hi rajasukh kaa upbhog kar rahe the
 In the war, the Hamletbhati dynasty was carrying the important responsibility of Ghori's army
 sapadalakshasamrajya ke prativeshi raja dwaara ghori kii aarthiksahaayta, sainyasahayta or suchnasahayta kii thi
 Yada Ghori with his military reached near the border of the Sapadalakshtra kingdom, then the states around the Tadapalakshtra-empire started to rise at the border of the Sapadalakshtra kingdom
 unka uddesh tha ki, chaaron ore se yuddhrat prithviraj kaa sanybal vibhakt ho jaayegaa
 At the time of the Second Narayan War, it happened according to his plan
 prithviraj kii sena sapadalakshasamrajya ke vibhinn kshetron main yuddh kar rahi thi
 The prince general of Sapradalakshmrajya was engaged in those wars during the war of Narayan
 prithviraj ke anya udayraj naamak senapati bhi anyatra yuddhrat the
 After defeating Ghori in the first Narayan war, Prithviraj became the subject of discussion in the regions of North India
 prithviraj ke bhootpurv shatru unke patan kii pratiksha kar rahe the
 So Yada Ghori fought with Prithviraj, then the kingdoms of Prithviraj attacked the kingdom of Prithviraj
 un rajyo main makhyatya sapadalakshasamrajya ke purv-dakshin-seemaa ke kannauj, kalinger, anhilpatan rajya the
 Bhimdev's mother Naikidevi was the daughter of Paramardev, the ruler of the Chandelvanshi of Jejakabhukti
 1182-83 varsh main un donon rajyon kii bhi prithviraj dwaara parijay hui thi
 On the other hand, furious Jayachand wanted to see the destruction of Prithviraj somehow
 narin ke pratham yuddh ke anantar hi sanyogita haran kii ghatana hui thi
 The historians who studied the conditions then said that Prithviraj was always in the Digvijay expedition, then he did many kings
 parantu prithviraj ne sab ko jeevandaan de diya
 Thus there was no increase in Prithviraj's army or range from the Digvijay campaign, but the number of his enemies was increasing daily
 shatruon kaa manbhang karke unako jeevandaan dena hi prithviraj kii paraajay kaa mukhyakaaran bana
 Under the coincidence, Prithviraj started spending more time with the newly married Sanyogita
 jisase ajayameru prasaad main kisi dushchakr kaa udbhav hua
 a rage named Prithviraj's Padmavati became envy in the mind of coincidence
 ajayameru prasaad main un donon ke madhya baaran baar kalah hone lage the
 Padmavati, neglected by Prithviraj, tried to occupy Prithviraj with the use of captivity
 usne tantrik vidhi ke chalate ek garbhvatee gaay kii hatya kar di
 After that, after breeding the cow, he started his tantric method
 tantrikavidhi ke siddh hone pashchaat prithviraj padmavati ke vasheebhoot ho gaye
 When Prithviraj was tied up in Padmavati's Tantrapash, then another unfortunate incident happened in Prasad
 sapadalakshasamrajya ke kaimaas naamak mahamandaleshwar prithviraj kii anupasthiti main samgr rajkaarya dekha karte the
 He was tied up in an illicit relationship with a maid named Camas Karnati
 samay praapt hote hi ve donon ratri ke andhkaar main rajbhavan main apni kamlila kaa aacharan karte the
 Once in the night, Padmavati saw Camas in a raid with that handmaid in a cell of Prasad
 padmavati ne prithviraj ko kaimaas ke kamprapanch kii chugali kar di
 Prithviraj Cho was confined in Padmavati's Tantrapash, so Prithviraj was unable to make the proper decision in the confusion
 tatpashchaat kaimaas jab raatri main daasi ke saath kaammagn tha, tab prithviraj vahaan pahunche or unhenne vahiin kaimaas kaa vadh kar diya
 The Kaimas had sinful relations with the maid, it was the misfortune of Ajayameru Prasad
 parantu puratanprabandhsangrah main kaimaas ke vadh kaa kaaran "deshadroh" ullikhit kiya gaya he
 According to the ancient management, Pratap Singh, the revenue officer of Prithviraj, used to go for tax acceptance in the Ghazni region
 ek baar garjani pradesh main 'masjid' ko pratapsingh ne ek laksh panon kaa daan de diya
 Sometimes the Kaimas said to the king, "O God, the wealth we get in the form of tax from the Ghazni region makes us king
 parantu rajasav adhikari pratapsingh us dhan kaa aise kaaryon main durvyay kar dete hai"
 When the king asked Pratapsingh about the accusation of Camas , he said, "dev! Knowing the adverse effect on you, i had spent that money
 kyonki jyotishi ne aapke jivan main ksht ke vishay main mujhe bataaya tha"
 Pratapsingh followed the censure in Prithviraj's ears, against the Camas
 vah bolaa, dev ! mantri kaimaas hi baar baar turk-janon ko yahan bulaate rahete hai
 On hearing Pratap Singh's words, the angry Prithviraj killed Camas
 ukt donon kathanak main satya or asaty kaa pareekshan kar to nahin sakate, parantu uplabdh pramaanon se do vishyo kii spashtataa ho rahi he
 One was many members of Ajayemaru rule in contact with the intelligence system of Ghori, Pratapasih was the chief among them
 dwitiya kaimaas ke vadh kii bhi pushti hoti he
 But it is not known in the treason or in the camp
 phutuhussalatin naamak pustak ke anusaar ajayameru pradesh ke rajaprasaad main kaimaas ke vadh kaa samachar ghori ke guptcharo ne gazani pradesh pahuchaya tha
 There are many arguments about the date of the Second Narayan War
 vibhinn pustako main vibhinn tithiyaan praapt hoti hai
 Those books can be divided into three departments
 ve vibhaag hai prithviraj raso ke, farsi lekhako ke or bhartiyarot ke anusaar tithiyaan
 Sanivasar Sankranti Crook
 shravan addho maas
 That is, Prithviraj had a battle with Ghori on the day of Shani Vamsar of 1158 Vikram Samvatsar
 us samay shravan maas aadha vyateet ho chukaa tha ouk karkasacranti thi
 Many of the dates mentioned in Prithviraj Raso Kavya have contradicted it
 kyonki anek bhartiyagranth or anya farsi granth bhi anya tithi kaa upasthaapan karte hai
 Hasan Nizami has mentioned in the book titled Tajul Masir that, in 'hijrisan' 587, Ghori started his journey from Ghazni region to India

 a comparative study of the date mentioned in the Farsigranthoe gives some guidance about the date of the war
 1190 varsh ke janvari maas ke untiis ve dinank ko yuddh kaa armbh hua tha, tatpashchaat 1191 varsh ke janvari maas kii satraa dinank ko yuddh purna ho chukaa tha
 That is, at any time before the twenty-ninth day of January 1190, Ghori started traveling towards India
 1191 varsh ke janvari maas kii satraa dinank se purv ghori ne narin yuddh main vijay paa lee thi
 According to the Persian text, Yavanmas, called 'ramadan', was about to begin
 1191 varsh ke janvari maas kii satraa dinank ko yadi 'ramajaan'-maas hoga, to hi farsigranth main ullikhit tithi kaa pramanya sidhya hota he

 The Yavanpanchang of the year starts from 1 Muharram

 That day was Shanivasara
 'ramajaan'-maas yavanpanchang ke anusaar dasavaan maas he, atah 1192 varsh ke sitambar maas kii dasmi dinank ko 'ramajaan'-maas kaa armbh hua tha
 Nizami states that the war of Narayan was completed even before the 'ramadan' month
 atah 1192 varsh ke janvari-maas kii satraa dinank se, 1192 varsh ke sitambar-maas kii dasmi dinank tak narin kaa yuddh purna ho chukaa tha
 The period of war would have been known in the Persian texts, but the exact date of the second war of Narayan is not known

 There are many evidences of both of them
 vah jainacharya kanyanayaniyamhavirapratimakalp naamak pustak ke rachanaakaar hai
 Historians are of the opinion that this book is more useful than Khartargachhapattavali

 Therefore, Mahashresthi Ramdev, the minister of Ajayameru, issued the information that, "before Yavan destroys the idols of Jainsangh, before that all the Jainacharya idols should be protected by making a secret cavity in the land"
 1248 vikram sanvatsar main ustaraanshilaalekh kaa nirmaan hua tha
 There were many dilapidated Jain temples and Veer Smarak mills from Rajasthan

 In those inscriptions it is mentioned that a monk named Rajnimitta Gohilvanshi Raji of Rana Motishwara was followed by Satidharma to Krishnawasthi Somvasar of Jyeshthamas of 1248 Vikram Samvatsara
 rana motishwara kii maranatithi ko hi vijayraj naamak uskaa putr bhi hutatma hua tha ye anya shilaalekh main ullikhit kiya gaya he
 Along with Motishwara and Vijayaraja, the names of many souls are found in inscriptions
 ukt tithi ke annusaar 1192 varsh ke may-maas kii chauthi dinank ko vah shilaalekh nirmit hua tha
 Therefore, before that date, those heroes died in a war, it is proved
 goth maangalod naamak sthaan se bhi anya shilaalekh praapt hua he
 That inscription was also quoted on the said date
 us shilaalekh ke anusaar jaisingh ke veergati ke pashchaat anek rajniyaan sati ho gai thi
 Shuklachaturdashi of Vaishakhamas of 1249 Vikram Samvatsar, received from a place called Bajlu), satirised his demise on the day of Somavasar when a parampramukh was killed

 The above evidences prove that before the fourth day of May-month of 1192 year, Ghori won the Narayan war
 tatpashchaat usne ajayameru par swadhikaar prasthaapit kar liya tha
 The adoption of the Persian texts, the Indian texts and the Indian inscriptions confirm that the overall event of the war took place from the eighth day of February-11 of the year 1192 to the twenty-seventh day of April-11 in the year 1192
 narin ke yuddh kii vaastavik tithi ke gnanarth 1685 vikram sanvatsar main likhit rajavali kaa adhyayan bhi mahatvapurn sidhya hua he
 For the first time in the year 1953, Jainshityacharya Agarchand Nahata published that Rajavali
 1953 varsh main dow dasharath sharma ke 'agyaat kartruk indraprastha prabandh ke kalevar' naamak pustak main wo aavali prakashit kii gai thi
 It is written in the genealogy that Tejpal established the suzerainty of Dehli by imprisoning Diwakar, son of Prithviraj's brother-in-law, Visalpal, on the Krishnadvittiya date of Chaitramas of 1249 Vikram Samvatsar
 1249 vikram sanvatsar ke chaitramas kii shukladwitiya tithi ko ghori ne tejpal ko parajeet kar dehali par aadhipaty kar liya
 The above evidences prove that the dehli did not fall before 17 March and Prithviraj died before 17 March
 narin yuddh ke anantar ghori kii sainyagatividhi ke bhi pramaan uplabdh hote hai
 In the book titled Tajul Masir, Hasan Nizami has mentioned that Ghori first reached ajayameru-prasad after the Narayana war, then he won Dehli
 hasan nijaami ke kathan kaa samarthan 'lubb tawaarikhe hind' naamak pustak bhi karata he 
 According to Rajavali, on the Krishnadvittiya date of Chaitramas of 1249 Vikram Samvatsar, Tejpal fled from Delhi to Delhi after escaping from Narayan Yudh
 aanglapatchang ke anusaar 1192 varsh ke march-maas kii tritiy dinank thi
 The war of Narayan was completed in the third strike
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, prithviraj ko sambhavtah teen baje yaa chaar baje turksainiko ne bindi banaaya hoga
 Tejpal must have fled the battlefield at the same time and left for Delhi

 According to Bharatiya Panchang that day was Holika festival
 1249 vikram sanvatsar ke phalgun-maas kii poornima tithi ko hindooon ke rakt se narin kaa yudhakshetra ranjit hua tha
 According to the opinion of Shri Harihar Niwas Dwivedi, the probable date of the post-narayan war may be the following
 • 1 march – narinyuddh kii samaapti • March 5 - Ghori takes Prithviraj to Ajayemaru
 • 11 march – prithvaaraj kaa hutatma hona
 • March 13 - Govind surrenders the kingdom of Ajayameru
 • 17 march – dehali kaa patan Prithviraj defeated Ghori in Narayankshetra in the year 1190
 tatpashchaat ekvarsh ke abhyaantar main ghori dwaara apane sainyashakti main vruddhi kii gai
 On the other hand, Prithviraj was busy in the field of Indian politics for a year
 unhone us varsh bhi anek yuddh lade the
 The political background of India in 1190 years, that background was contrasted in one year
 rajputon ke antajkalah vishalkay ho chuke the
 The north Indian kings were constantly engaged in inter-war
 ghori dwaara rajput raajaaon kii paraspar sangharsh kii sthiti kaa laabh liya gaya or prithviraj ke upar punah akraman kiya gaya
 In the battlefield of Narayan, Ghori was "adorned to win any form of victory"
 duusari ore prithviraj kii sainyasajjataa hi nahin thi
 Ghori knew how much Prithviraj's military strength is and that Prithviraj is not equipped for war
 prithviraj kii yuddh sambaddh asajjataa ke vishay main hammirmahakavye vivaran praapt hota he
 It is mentioned in the Hammirmahakaavya that Udayaraja, the commander of Prithviraj, arrived late in the battlefield of his army
 prithviraj ke pradhan to narin yuddh main bhaag bhi nahin le sakaa
 Because he was engaged in another war
 viruddhavidhividhvansh naamak granth ke 17 shloke main bhi ese varnan praapt hote hai
 It was necessary for Prithviraj to have a delay in the war, but Ghori was ready to fight by taking advantage of the weakness of Prithviraj
 ghori or uske adhikari yudhyojna ke vishay main bahut kuch pariklpana karke yuddh ke liye sajj the
 When they ?, where? and how ? All of this had been thought by them to attack Prithviraj's army
 The army that Ghori had in Narayan area was divided into four divisions
 us sena ke sainik bhaar viheen shastron or bharasahit ashwon se sajj thae
 The army, which was divided among the Chora divisions, was adorned to attack the Indian Army in all four directions
 jo sena chaaron vibhaag main vibhakt thi, unke atirikt 10,000 sainikon ke ek dal kii rachana ghori ne kii thi
 The 10,000 soldiers were able to wield arrows despite mounting on the horse
 ghori dwaara unako aadesh diya gaya tha ki, wein sarvada shatruon ke saath vam, dakshin, agr or prishth bhaag se yuddh karen
 Further, Ghori had ordered that the cavalry, bearers and elephants of the Indian Army should come forward to attack, and then go backwards and make as much difference as possible between them and the enemy
 ghori kii ye niti bharti sainikon main bhram utpaadit karne ke liye thi
 By the said policy, if the Turksmen conduct in the battlefield, then there is confusion among the Indian soldiers that all the Turksena soldiers are in the battlefield
 ghori kii ranneeti kii vibhinn pariyojna vibhinn pustakon main praapt hoti he
 As it is mentioned in the book Yehia Sarhindi, that the elephants of the Hindus and the horsemen invaded any of the Turksena Dalis, while the other parties attacked from all three directions
 isami ke pustak main bhi ullikhit he ki, narin ke prathamyuddh ke anantar ghori kaa chintan tha ki, bhartiya hastion kii upasthiti main turkdeshiy ashv bhaybheet the, atah dwitiya yuddh main hamen mukhyatya hathi par hi prahaar karne hai
 For this, horse were also trained by Ghori in Ghazni region along with Aibak
 ukt sainya yojana ke saath ghori ne sampoorn raatri sainya sajjataa main vyateet kii
 On the other hand, Prithviraj's army was under deep sleep the whole night
 brahmamuhoort main ghori kii sena prithviraj kii shivi par chaaron ore se akraman karne ke liye sajj thi
 At the time when Prithviraj's soldiers were sleeping, Ghori attacked
 yuddh ke armbh main sway prithviraj bhi nidra main nimagn the
 Some soldiers were busy with daily tasks
 998 varsh main yatha lamgaan-yuddh main hua tha, tathaev narin yuddh main bhi hua
 The Supt Rajput army was attacked by armor, armed and cavalry
 chaalis sahasr se adhik turksainikon ne prithviraj kii sena ke upar aksmaat akraman kar diya tha
 By the time all were decorated, the situation had become like a cataclysm
 anek rajputsainiko kii yudhshibir main hi mrityu ho chuki thi
 Prithviraj's more powerful army was destroyed in that attack
 itihasvidon ke mat he ki, narin kaa dwitiya yuddh vaastavik yuddh nahin tha, api tu durghatana hi thi
 In that war neither elephants or horsemen were used in war, nor any Rajputs could make war
 aashcharyachakit sab praanantak vednaa se aahat yamalok chale gayi
 Most soldiers could not even bathe, some could not even reach near the horse, many Rajput soldiers were killed even before the declaration of war
 us akraman main akramanakari hi shubhasthiti main the, kyonki unhone akraman kaa kaal or sthaan nirdhaarit kiya tha
 He himself was leading Ghori's Central Army
 uske vam bhaag main ilaah naamak senapati or dakshin bhaag main mukalba naamak senapati tha
 The advance team was led by a warrior named Kharbak
 kharmel naamak yoddha apni sena ke saath ghori ke prishth bhaag main niyukt tha
 Qutbuddin Aibak was leading all the departments
 vah sarvada ghori ke sameep hi bana rahata tha
 At that time, Ghori's army consisted of 1,03,000 cavalry
 ghori kii sena kaa prayek sainik 'jihar' naamak kavach se susajjit tha
 Ghori's reserve army consisted of 12,000 aggressive warriors
 wein sab bhi 'jihar' naamak kavach se, loh ke mukut se or asi, dhanush or shul ke saath susajj the
 Prithviraj's army was shattered by the sudden invasion of the Ottoman forces
 sainiko kaa netritv karne ke liye koi bhi samarth nahin tha
 At that time a commander named Govind Rai of Dehli led an army of Rajputs
 usne apni sena ko ekatrit karke turk sena ke viruddh yuddh armbh kar diya
 While Govind Rai was leading the war, other army chiefs also joined him
 kendriya sena kaa netritv pithora ne kiya
 Padmasha Rawal, the president of the left-wing army of Govindarai and the commander of the army of the south, named Bhuvanackamall, were leading the troops of the Nijsena
 gownd raay ne hathisena ke saath khabarak ke agrim dal par akraman kar diya
 Khabarak somehow protected himself
 tatpashchaat usne apane sainikon ko aadesh diya ki, "apane baanon se keval hathion par akraman karo"
 According to Khabarak's orders, the Turksmen attacked the elephants and the Mahavats
 hathisena ke 54 chauvan hathi turk sainikon ke baanon se aahat ho gaye
 Due to which the elephants of the Indian army will be made here isami ke varnan anusaar iske pashchaat hi hindoosena paraajay kii ore unmukh hui
 It is mentioned in the angel that, according to Ghori's order, his army was divided into four divisions
 ghori kaa aadesh tha ki, sabhi vibhaag hindoosena ke saath milakar nahin, api tu vibhagashah yuddh karen
 "if Hindus armies are victorious on Yavanasena, then the soldiers leave the battlefield
 tatpashchaat rajputsainik aapke peeche aayenge, yudhakshetra se dur uchitasthaan par pahunchakar yavansainik hindoosena ke upar akraman kar deven
 Somehow all Hindusanis have to be destroyed "this was also Ghori's order
 yavansena ghori ke aadesh anusaar brahmamuhuut se armbh kar madhyahn paryant yuddh karti rahi, parantu hindoosena kii paraajay kii sambhaavna bhi nahin dikh rahi thi
 In the afternoon, Ghori felt that, in a war with the Hindusena, he still had no victory, he ordered the reserve army to attack
 12,000 arakshit yavansainikon ne aakasmik reeti se hindoosena ke upar akraman kar diya
 That attack was very frightening
 us akraman main anek hindoosainik hutatma ho gayi
 Prior to the war, Prithviraj's army was divided into several divisions as a result of the conspiracy of treason by the border states by attacking Sapalaksha Empire from all four
 tatpashchaat yuddh ke din brahmamuhoort main ghori kii sena kaa aniatik reeti se prithviraj kii yuddh shibir par akraman se anek hindoosainik hutatma ho gaye
 Not only did many royal families of India plot against Prithviraj, but many officials of Prithviraj's army had also joined the conspiracy of Yavan army
 prithviraj ke sameepvarti ke vishwasghaat se hi prithviraj bandi bhi hue
 The above statement is also supported by the authors Hassan Nizami, Isami, Naychandsoori etc
 inaki pustako main yuddh ke virnan vistaar se praapt hote hai
 While the war was at its zenith and Govind Rai was victorious over the Turkasena with the influence of his elephantine, Prithiviraj was leading the Hindusena and Ghori Yavasena's central divisions
 usee samay kharmel ne apane dhanurdhar sainiko ko aadesh diya ki, "hindoosena ke hathion par akraman karen"
 Then the Yavan soldiers attacked the elephants of Hindusena with full force
 banvarsha se aahat hathi bhaybheet hokar itastatah palaayan karne lage
 In that infestation, by the order of Kharmel, the sound was made by the Yvansayas running behind the elephants, and the sound was made from them
 hindoosena main astavyastata kii sthiti main do ghatnaayen ho gai
 First of all, the elephant on which Prithviraj was meditating, he became uncontrolled after being hurt by arrows
 atah prithviraj aahat hathi se neeche utre or apane vishwast ko ashv laane kii ajna di
 Secondly, Ghori ordered his troops to attack from the left and the south, seeing the disastrous situation in the Hindu army and also ordered 12,000 reserve soldiers to attack
 He himself came forward with the Central Army
 aahat hathi se neeche utarkar prithviraj jis ashv par arurh bue, vah ashv naatyashaala kaa ashv tha
 The conspiracy of traitors with Ghori was often successful in the battlefield
 jab prithviraj ashv par arurh hue, tab duusare hi kshan ghori ke sainikon ne bheri ko bajaanaa armbh kar diya
 Hearing Bheri's music, Prithviraj's horse started dancing
 ashv kii sthiti dekhakar prithviraj jaan gayi ki, kya hua he ? or kya hoga ?
 He soon descended from that horse and started a war with Hindu substances
 usee samay peeche se kisi turksainik ne prithviraj kii greeva par aghat kiya
 After this, the Turksmen combined and attacked Prithviraj and made Prithviraj a prisoner
 1192 varsh ke march-maas kii pratham dinank ko aakasmik akraman, bubhuksha, pipaasa or shadyantron se thake hindoosainik yuddh main parajeet ho gayi
 On that day, the numerous Veerasanikas of 36 dynasties gave their lives to protect their motherland
 anek balak anaath or anek striyaan vidhwaa ho gai
 With the fall of the Sapadalaksha kingdom, King Jayachand of Kannauj region celebrated the festival by lighting a lamp of Ghrit
 narin ke yuddh main vijay praapt kar ghori prithviraj ko lekar ajayameru -prasaad pahucha
 It was only after the entry of the city that the Turksmen started the city

 The wealth and valuable things of the people were forcefully abducted by the paramilitary

 In the city, there were recitations of women, boys, old men and men

 Many scholars of Prithviraj Raso poetry are not composed by Chandbaradhi, many scholars have proved this
 gazani pradesh main ek baan se prithviraj ne ghori kaa vadh kiya iskaa prithviraj raso kavy main varnan he
 Against which there are differences among many historians
 ghori ke vadh ke pashchaat chand or prithviraj ne paraspar ghaat karke mrityu kaa varan kar liya is ullekh ke saath hi varnan miltaa he ki, ye soochna chand dwaara ullikhit he
 How can a person even describe his death? This is the first question that arises
 tatpashchaat shilaalekh ityadi ke vishleshan se anek pramaan praapt hote hai
 So that it is not composed by Rachna Chand, but it seems that some other unknown poet has objected in it
 yadhyapi prithviraj raso kavy ke mulstrot main parvartin se vah dooshit ho gaya he, tathaapi rasokavy main banvedh kaa varnan sarvatha anaitihaasik nahin siddh hota
 Ta is the Sultan above, do not miss Chauhan
 ukt pankti ke ghosh bhartiya janamanas main anek shatakon se atyant lokapriy he or aaj bhi he
 The arrow run by Prithviraj would have given distinction to Ghori, but before that, the traitors helped Ghori and Ghori died
 prithviraj kaa antimkaal kaisaa tha? iske vishay main bhartiya sahitya main paryaapt pramaan uplabdh hai
 There is also a difference of each Indian source in the presentation of the evidence, but the Persian texts are also the same
 jin madhyakaalin sahitya main prithviraj ke mrityu kaa ullekh praapt hota he, un main prithviraj raso kavyan, puratanprabandhsangrahah, viruddhavidhividhwansah, surjacharitamahakavyan, rajdarshini, kanhdade-prabandhah, prabandhchintamanih or hammirmahakavyan antarbhoot hote hai
 In Persian literature, texts such as Tajul Masir, Jawami ul Hikayata or Rivayat, Tabakate Nasiri, Futuhussalatin, Datee Farishta, Guldashne Ibrahimi and ain-akbari are prominent
 ghori prithviraj ko bandi bana kar gazani pradesh le gaya
 Chandbaradayi was absent in that war, because he himself went to Jammu to make a treaty with a feudal named Hahuli Hammir by order of Prithviraj
 vahaan hammir naamak samant ne chandabaradaayi ke paraamarsh ko asweekaar kar diya or chandabaradaayi ko hi jalpa-devi ke mandir main bindi bana liya
 After the end of the war, Chand was liberated
 prithviraj parajeet hue hai or wein ghori ke bandi hai ye samachar chand ko mili
 Therefore, he went to Ghazni region for the salvation of his emperor
 vahaan apane vaak chaaturya se chand ne ghori ko prabhavit kiya
 After that Ghori told him that, despite being blind, Prithviraj is able to skillfully hit the target
 is prakaar ghori ko wo chamatkaar dekhne ke liye prerit kiya
 Chand then describes how Prithviraj killed Ghori with a single arrow
 ghori ke maran ke pashchaat prithviraj or chand ne aatmghaat kar liya
 According to Chand, he and Prithviraj died in the Ghazni region
 ukt kathanak prithviraj raso kavy ke laghutam, madhyam, or brihat tino roopaantaron main uplabdh hota he

 It is mentioned in the "prithvirajaprabandha" of the Puraniprabandha sangraha that, by placing the weight in the king's cervix, Ghori made Prithviraj a prisoner from the hierarchy of Suvarna
 tatpashchaat vah prithviraj ko yoginipur le gaya
 In the Rajprasad of Delhi, Ghori asked Prithviraj, "O Rajan! If i give you life, what will you do?"
 prithviraj ne pratiprashn kiya ki, "maine tuje saat baar jeevandaan diya, kya tum mujhe ekbar bhi chhodoge?"
 Whose neonatal tumors were removed, they felt sorry in front of Prithviraj Ghori
 tatpashchaat prithviraj ke pradhan ne puchha, dev! kya karnaa chaiye? niyati dwaara nirdhaarit ye sankat samudbhoot hua he
 Prithviraj said, "if you give me a bow, i can kill it"
 pradhan ne puchha, maharaj! evamev karotu
 After that the Pradhan went near Ghori and said, do not sit at this place
 atah ghori ne apane sthaan par louh kaa puttal prasthaapit karvaa diya or pashchaat us pradhan ne prithviraj ko dhanushkand diya
 Prithviraj, by the blow of his arrow, made two parts of Lohputal
 phir unhone dhanushkand kaa tyaag kar diya
 But on hearing the sound of iron they understood that, they have failed
 atah unhone man main hi sochaa ki, meraa kaary to apurna hi rah gaya, atah anya koi mujhe maar hi daalega
 After that Ghori threw Prithviraj in a mahagarta and he ordered Prithviraj to kill him with stones
 yadi inkaa rakt bhoomi par padegaa, to shubh hi hoga aisa wo baar baar logta rahaa
 In 1246 Vikram Samvatsar, the Yavanas killed the stones and took the life of Prithviraj
 banvedh kaa prasang yahan bhi praapt hota he parantu varnan kinchit bhinn he
 Here Ghori's place receives details of his piercing piercing
 yahan sthaan gazani pradesh nahin, api tu dehali he
 Prithviraj Raso is mentioned in the poem that, Prithviraj committed suicide, but according to Jainacharya, Prithviraj died due to the injuries of the stones in a pit here
 is kathanak main keval prithviraj kii mrityu kaa ullekh he
 There is no description of Chandbaradiyi and Ghori's death
 chandrasekharakrut surjancharitamahakavy kii rachana 1692 vikram sanvatsar maani jaati he
 From the 120th verse of the Dasarasarga of the Surjancharitamahakavya to the 168th verse, there is a narration that Prithviraj, the interim of Digvijay campaign, made Ghori a prisoner
 ikkis baar prithviraj ne ghori ko bandi banaaya or phir chhod diya, parantu usne prithviraj kaa apkaar hi kiya
 In a battle, Ghori took Prithviraj as a prisoner and took him to Ghazni region
 vahaan usne prithviraj ko netraheen kar diya
 After that Prithviraj's friend also reached Gajni state
 usne prithviraj ko pratishodh ke liye prerit kiya
 Prithviraj said, i have no army and no eyes
 aise main pratishodh kaise sambhav he?
 Then Chandbaradiyi reminded Prithviraj of rhetoric and Prithviraj was adorned for vengeance
 prithviraj ke saath shabdavedhvidya kii yojana karke chandabaradaayi ghori kii sabha main gaya
 In a few days, Chandbardayi became a confidant of Ghori and his ministers
 tatpashchaat ek din chandabaradaayi ne sabha main kaha, prithviraj andh hokar bhi lohe kii shrinkhalaon ko bhedane main samarth hai
 His skills should be shown one time only
 chandabaradaayi ne kehane par ghori prithviraj ke kaushal dekhne ke liye tatpar ho gaya
 After that, in Rajprasad, yavansainik tied a suvarnasrikhla on a pillar and bowed it in the hands of Prithviraj
 chandabaradaayi ne ghori ko kaha ki, tum swayan teen baar prithviraj ko baan chalaane ke liye ajna do, uske pashchaat hi wein banvedh karegein
 In this way, Prithviraj fired the arrow after the word came out from the mouth
