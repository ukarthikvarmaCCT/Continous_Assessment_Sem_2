 samajikaran vah prakriya he jiske madhyam se manushya samaaj ke vibhinn vyavhaar, reeti-rivaaz, gatividhiyaan ityadi sikhta he
 The conversion of human beings from biological existence to social existence is also through socialization
 samajikaran ke madhyam se hi vah samskruti ko aatmsaat karata he
 The process of socialization introduces humans to the physical and non-physical forms of culture
 seekhney kii yah prakriya samaaj ke niyamon ke adheen chalati he
 In the language of sociology, we assimilate the social perception of our situation or status and the method of playing the role accordingly
 samajikaran vyakti ko saamaajik rup se kriyasheel banaata he
 It is through this that the discretion to conduct in accordance with the culture is developed
 iske liye vyakti dwaara saanskrithik mulyon kaa jo abhyantareekaran kiya jaataa he vah samajikaran kaa hi rup he
 But in the analysis and study of socialization, it should be kept in mind that social norms and culture are of paramount importance in the process of learning
 inhen asweekaar kar jo kuch siikhaa jaataa he, jaise hatya, chori yaa anya aapraadhik vaaradaaten karnaa, unhen samajikaran main nahin gina jaataa balki inaki ginati vipathagami vyavhaar main hoti he
 The person learning these is considered contrary to the mainstream of society
 vah samaaj main sakaaratmak yogadan dene kii avasthaa main bhi nahin rahata he
 These negative actions and behaviors are often seen as examples of failed socialization
 is prakaar samajikaran vyakti ko samaaj kaa prakaaryaatmak sadsy bana kar samaaj kii kriyaaon main bhaag lene main samarth banaata he
 One of the most important features of socialization is that it is a lifelong process
 vyakti kii paristhiti va saamaajik bhoomikaaye badalati rahati hai or unke anuroop vyavhaar ke liye use aacharan tathaa vyavhaar ke naye pratimaan seekhney padate hai
 For example, in childhood, where the child learns to behave with parents, relatives and the elderly through socialization, at a young age he has to learn new ways of dealing with his colleagues, superiors, neighbors, etc
 in the office 
 yahan tak ki vriddhavastha main bhi vyakti nayi bhoomikaagat apekshaaon ke anusaar sambandhit saamaajik vyavhaar grahan karata he
 Thus, socialization is a process that continues from birth to death
 samajikaran main siikhe gayi saamaajik or saanskrithik mulya desh-kaal saapeksh hote hai
 Therefore, the process of socialization is also country-time relative
 jaise ki kuch kabyli jatiyon main bacchon ko astr-shastr kaa prashikshan dene par or shahari samaajon main bacchon ko aupchaarik shiksha pradaan karne par bal diya jaataa he
 In a society like caste-based society like India, socialization has also been done according to caste occupations and ritualistic status
 jaise ki nimna jati ke bacchon ko krishi, dastakaari va shaareerik shram ke liye taiyaar kiye jane kaa chalan tha, jabaki brahman baalkon ko shiksha pradaan kii jaati thi
 Cultures in different parts of the world vary greatly, therefore socialization is relative
 yah kaal-saapeksh is prakaar he ki guzare jamaane main bhartiya samaaj main striyon ke liye pardaa karnaa, sharmaana or dhime swar main bolnaa adarsh vyavhaar tha
 Whereas in today's era of male-female equality, such social behavior is not expected much from women
 pehle bacchon ko charan-sparsh kii shiksha di jaati thi, jabaki aaj ve boy-boy karte hai
 That is, the change in values and pattern of development has also changed the method of socialization
 samajashastriyon ne samajikaran kii puri prakriya ko do hisson main vibhakt kiya he : praathmik samajikaran or dwitiyak samajikaran
 This division is based on the division of primary and secondary institutions of society
 praathmik samajikaran parivaar, pados evam naatedari, mitra-samooh va aarmabhik schuli shiksha ke madhyam se hota he jisamen baccha samaaj kaa sahabhaagi sadsy banane ke bare main bahut kuch sikhta he
 It is seen as a fundamental institution in socialization, considering the family as universal
 iske tahat sahyog, sahanubhuti, sahaayta tathaa aadan-pradaan ke gunon kaa vikaas hota he
 The love of brothers and sisters, love and control of elders have a special role in socialization of a person
 dwitiyak samajikaran kishoravastha se armbh hota he jisamen vyakti adhik aupchaarik vaataavaran kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar aacharan karnaa sikhta he
 In this stage, colleges, universities, political institutions, economic institutions like markets and shops, cultural institutions, business groups such as offices and factories, etc
 help them to become functional members of society
 samajikaran saamaajik niyantran kii samasya kaa bhi sahi samaadhaan pradaan karata he
 Difficulty in social control comes when people do not behave according to social norms
 samajikaran se samaaj ke sabhi sadsy ek si saamaajik sthiti main ek sa vyavhaar karte hai or samaaj main santulan, shanti tathaa saamanjasy barkaraar rahata he
 Suffixes such as de-socialization are also used under socialization
 iskaa arth yah he ki nakaaratmak samajikaran ke prabhaav main samaaj virdohi aacharan karnaa sikh chuke logon ko is prakaar kaa aacharan karne ke liye hatotsahit kiya jaae
 For example, if a person of criminal character is punished or understood and exempted from crimes, it will be a kind of de-socialization for him
 vi-samajikaran is rup main bhi dikhataa he ki vyakti pehle kii shikshaaon ko jaise buzurgon ke charan sparsh karne, havan-puja karne tathaa maansaahaar na karne jaise vyavhaar ko bade hone par bhul jaae
 This can be called de-socialization of learned behavior
 punrsamajikaran bhi isi se judi prakriya he jisamen vyakti kii jivan-style va vichaaron main parivartan ghatit hota he
 In the service of the army, training the person completely to the new style of life, attracting a criminal to positive thoughts, post-marriage woman's self-styling according to the different lifestyle of the house are examples of this re-socialization
 samajikaran ko vibhinn vichaarkon or samajashastriyon ne siddhanton ke aadhaar par samajhane kaa prayaas kiya he jinamein ji
ech
 mid, charles kule, emil durkhime pramukh hai
 Mead has primarily grounded the notion of a generalized other
 isamen dusron ke apane sambandh main vichaaron va apekshaaon ko koi baccha evam vayask aantarikikrut karata he
 In childhood, a child imagines the works of others and sees himself through them
 is prakaar vah saamaajik drushti se apni iyatta kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 Charles Cooley explains his theory on the basis of introspection in the mirror
 kule ke mutabik bachche kii iyatta kaa nirdhaaran teen avasthaaon se hota he
 First, he wants to know what others think of me
 doosraa, vah dusron kii raay ke sandarbh main apane bare main paidaa soch ko samajhane kii cheshtaa karata he
 Third, he starts thinking of himself as good or bad, superior or inferior
 kule kii mukhya prasthaapana yah he ki vyakti ek lambi prakriya main apane bare main dharna banaata he or yah dharna dusron kii sahaayta se hi nirmit hoti he
 Durkheim has tried to explain socialization through social fact and collective representation
 unke mutabik samaaj kii paramparaayen, mulya, mandand, samuhik vishwaas aadi saamaajik tathy vyakti se upar hote hai
 a person gets his inheritance from birth
 inaki rachana vyakti kii akeli It is made by the group rather than by the hands of the unit
 ye vyakti se baahar hai or uske upar baadhyataa bhi aropit karte hai
 In this way, by assimilating these collective representations in the form of socialization, the person becomes an active and useful unit of the society, thereby also maintaining unity in the society

 bharatendu kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaary yah he ki unhone hindi sahitya ko, or uske saath samaaj ko samrajya-virdohi disha main badhane kii prerana di

 unhone likhaa tha – The British carry India's wealth with them and this is the root cause of the poverty and sufferings of the people of the country, this truth was understood by Bharatendu

 Therefore, one corner symbolizes stability and one corner symbolizes versatility
 vasant, kaamdev kaa mitra he isliye kaamdev kaa dhanush phulon kaa bana hua he
 The command of this bow is voiceless
 yani, kaamdev jab kaman se tir chhodte hai, to uski aawaaj nahin hoti

 The whole creation is governed by the same opposite sex attraction
 kaamdev kaa ek lakshya khud kaam hai, jinhen purush mana gaya he, jabaki doosraa rati hai, jo stri rup main jaani jaati hai
 Armor is a symbol of protection
 kaamdev kaa rup itnaa balashaali he ki yadi isaki suraksha nahin kii gai to viplav laa saktaa he
 That is why this armor is tied to the protection of Cupid
 yani surakshit kaam prakritik vyavhaar keliye aavashyak mana gaya he, taaki saamaajik buraaiyon or bhayankar bimariyon ko dur rakhaa ja sake
 When the demon Tarakasura created a fire, the gods begged Kamadeva to kill Tarakasura so that he could fall in love with Shiva and Parvati because Tarakasura had the boon that only Shiva and Parvati's son can kill Tarakasura
 to kaamdev tathaa devi rati kailash parvat shiv kaa dhyaan bhang karne ke liye gayi par kaamdev kaa baan lagane se shiv kaa dhyaan to bhang ho gaya par shiv ko bahut krodh aa gaya va shiv ne apana teesraa netra khol kar kaamdev ko bhasma kar diya tathaa rati ko bhi apane kii mrityu par krodh aa gaya to rati ne parvati ko shraap diya ki parvati ke pet se koi bhi putr janm nahi legaa
 On hearing this curse, Parvati became unhappy and Shiva explained to Parvati that she should not be sad and that Shiva married Nav Parvati
 jab devataayo ne is shraap ke bare me tathaa kaamdev kii maut ke bare me suna to vah bade vyakul ho gayi to devo ne chal se tarakasur ko vardaan dilaayaa ki tarakasur kaa vadh keval shiv ke pet se janamaa putr hi kar saktaa he

 By the way, in some scriptures, Cupid is also said to be sitting on a parrot, but it is not included in the original concept

 An alcoholic elephant can be seen in three directions and can be cautious even if a slight sound is made at the back
 hathi kaanon se har taraf kaa sun saktaa he or apni sound se chaaron dishaao main waar kar saktaa he
 Similarly, the character of Cupid is also seen
