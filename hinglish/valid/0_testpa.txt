 tatvamasi bharat ke puraatan hindu shastron va upanishdon main varnit chaar mahavakyon main se ek he, jiskaa shabdic arth he - "vah tum hi ho"
 xxrep 5 ★ Mahavakya is Tattvamasi xxrep 5 ★ tatvamasi kaa arth he, vah tu hi he
 He is not far, very close, more than near
 tera hona hi vahi he
 This is Mahavakya
 mahavakya kaa arth hota he ki agar is ek vaakya ko bhi pakad kar koi puraa anusandhan kar le, to jivan kii param sthiti ko uplabdh ho jaae
 Therefore it is called Mahavakya
 phir kisi shaastra kii koi bhi jarurat nahin he, or kisi veda or kisi quran or bible kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Tattvamasi is sufficient Veda
 is ek vaakya kaa koi thik se shravan kar le, manan kar le, nididhyasana kar le, samadhi kar le, to kisi or shaastra kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Mahavakya means: capitalized, in which everything has come
 yah mahavakya aadhyatmik chemistry kaa formula he
 There are three things said in this, that, that, you, you; Both are one - there are three things
 vah or tu ek hai, bas itnaa hi yah sutara he
 But all the Vedanta, all the experience of sages, comes in these three
 yah jo ganit jaisaa sutara he vah – astitv, paramatma or tu vah jo bheetar chhipi chetana he vah, ye do nahin hai, ye ek hai
 This is the essence of all Vedas, then everything else is spread
 isliye is tarah ke vaakya ko upanishdon main mahavakya kaha gaya he
 Such sentences should be heard in complete silence
 isliye hajaaron saal tak bharat main rishiyon kaa aagrah rahaa ki jo param shaan he, vah likhaa na jaae
 His request was very valuable
 lekin use puraa karnaa asambhav tha

 Many people, especially philologists, linguists think that since there was no script, there was no way to write, so Vedas and Upanishads were not written for a long time
 ve galat sochate hai
 Because those who could provide an experience like Tattvamsi, who could experience this Mahavakya, would not have discovered the art of writing, it seems impossible
 likhane kii kala to thi, lekin ve likhane ko raji nahin the
 Why? Because if such Mahavakyas are written, then everyone reads in every condition

 These sentences are listenable only under a particular quality, a particular state, a particular state of mind

 sahyog kaa arth do yaa adhik vyaktiyon yaa sansthaaon kaa milakar kaam karnaa he
 In the process of cooperation, knowledge is exchanged frequently and in all directions
 yah ek samaan lakshya kii prapti kii disha main uthaaya gaya buddhi vishyak kaary he
 It is not necessary that leadership is necessary for cooperation
 parantu yah aavashyaktaa nahin he ki netritv kaa bhi sahyog nahin hota he
 Cooperation is through each other
 phir bhi aapasi sahyog kaa hona bahut jaruri hota he
 One should move forward
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki kisi bhi sanstha ke sahyog karne se aapasi sahyog ki sambhaavna bahut adhik hoti he
 Nevertheless, whether it is traditional or economic cooperation matters a lot
 sahyog ki bhaavana har manushya main hona chahie
 And i can support others
 ek dusre ke sahyog se desh ho yaa manushya ki jivan main badhata rahata he
 There are also many types of cooperation
 aarthik ho yaa takaniki sahyog iske aadi or bhi ho sakate hai
 But cooperation takes place as a specific task
 tab par bhi ghar ho yaa baahar kisi jagah par sahyog kaa aadan-pradaan kiya ja saktaa he
 But it is not necessary that only the money can be supported
 jivan main manushya kaa sahyog ek kartatv hi nahin balki manushya kii jivan style main sahyog kaa hona jaruri he
 There is no limit of cooperation that can ever be supported by any person
 tab par bhi apane ko ek saamaanya kii bhanti jivan main manushya kii sahyog karnaa chahie
 You can support any institution or place of religion
 chaahe hindu kii dharm sthaan ho yaa muslim kii kisi bhi dharm sthaan yaa sanstha yaa socity main apana sahyog kar sakate hai
 If the leaders of any country visit each other, then it makes each other a feeling of mutual support
 or donon deshon kii aapas main sahyog karata dekha jaataa he
 Even then, it is important to have mutual support between the two countries
 sahyog kisi bhi kshetra main aap de sakate hai
 You can cooperate in financial or technical and other fields
 sahyog kaa matlab hota he kisi bhi prakaar kaa ho saktaa he
 There may be development or cooperation in energy or nuclear and technology etc
 or kisi bhi desh ke saath ek dusre ke liye aap kisi bhi kshetra main aap sahyog karne ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 Because cooperation has meaning
 ek dusre kaa jab tak kisi bhi desh dusre desh se sahyog nahin karte hai
 Can not proceed till then
 or kisi bhi desh chahta he ki kisi bhi desh se sahyog bana rahe
 Only then can development happen
 chaahe netaa ho yaa saadhaaran vyakti koi bhi vyakti chaahate hai ki sahyog bana rahe
 And it is a matter of India
 to bharat ke liye ek mahatvapurn baat hota he ki kisi bhi desh ke liye sahyog bana hona
 Life can be supported by anyone
 parantu yah kehnajaruri nahin he
 When will anyone get support? kyonki koi kisi ko nahin jaanate hai ki kiskaa sahyog kisko milegaa
 And every man wants me to cooperate as much as possible
 sahyog har aadmi kii bhaavana hona chahie
 That i can cooperate
 kyonki jivan main kya lekar aaye hai
 This man gets a chance that i can support each other
 chaahe apana ho yaa paraayaa kisi ko aap sahyog kar sakate hai
 There is no pressure to cooperate on it
 kyonki sahyog dabaab kaa jeej nahin he
 Every man has some cooperation
 chahen aap ki jivan main patni ho yaa gaanv kaa log zarur sahyog karata he
 It is not necessary that the people of the village can support you
 kahin or kaa aadmi bhi ho sakate hai
 Cooperation only provides such power
 jo aadmi ko lakshya tak pahunchaata he
 Cooperation should be felt in every man
 manushya hi ek aise praani he
 Who can support everyone
 kyonki sahyog se kisi ko safalataa milte hai
 So he should cooperate with us
 kisi bhi tarah kaa sahyog aap karnaa chaahate hai
 so you can
 sahyog ke liye kisi ko koi dabaab nahin diya jaataa he
 Which you can give as per your faith
 lekin kisi bhi santhaan ke liye aap apni sahyog kaa maapdand aap par nirbhal karata he
 And what kind of participation can i become in it? har kisi ko sahyog ki bhaavana hona chahie
 Because cooperation is not such a thing
 jo dusro ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 But as long as it works as any institution
 sahyog har aadmi ko karnaa chahie
 Cooperation changes the mood of a man
 sahi samay par kiya gaya kaam acha maane jate hai
 Cooperation should be done with each other
 parantu ek apni disha ke anusaar kaam karnaa chahie
 Today does its work for cooperation
 sahyog har gaanv yaa samaaj main hota he
 Can be of any caste
 par sahyog sab ki kerani chahie
 And of any kind you should cooperate
 sahyog sabase bada manushya ke liye mahatvapurn kaam he
 In all aspects of life, cooperation always has a very important role
 har harah se manushya kaa sahyog karnaa chahie
 Support for a work that gets a chance for others to come forward
 sahyog hi ek he jo har desh, gaanv, samaaj yaa kisi bhi jati varg kaa aap sahyog karte hai
 You must have seen how many people have died due to cloudburst in Uttarakhand
 usee tarah samaaj ko aage laane ke liye log sahyog kar rahe hai
 Collaboration is one thing that you can cooperate in every way
 jis tarah kaa uttrakhand main hua he agar aap is main sahyog nahin kijie ga to kis main kijie ga
 This is a big loss
 desh ke liye
 We should cooperate for this
 har jati dharm ke liye sahyog bahut maine rakhte hai
 You can have some kind of support from anywhere in the village or city
 sahyog ke liye koi pabandhi nahin he
 Man of any country can cooperate in any country
 bharat main hi nahin puure sansar main aap kahin bhi sahyog kar sakate hai
 And any man in any country wants to cooperate
 to us aadmi ko koi nahin roak saktaa sahyog karne se chahen sarkaar ho yaa aam aadmi kuch nahin kar sakate hai
 No person should be tied up in personal work
 har manushya kii jivan main ek vyaktigat rup se apni koi na koi khyaal rakhata he
 And under any circumstances he continues to do his work
 yahi kaaran hota he
 When people have their own feeling that i can support others
 to is main kisi ko virodh nahin karnaa chahie
 And every type of work should be done in life
 jo manushya ke liye laabhadaayak hoti he
 Should do the same

 kyonki ye abhaasi udhaaharan maang par utpann hue hai, yah nirdhaarit karnaa asambhav he ki ek die gaye samay main aise kitne vms chalenge
 Since vms can be generated on any given computer according to the demand of the situation, as well as where they are located in a specific location, this situation is more likely to be found on a cloud network
 network aarekh main ek saamaanya varnan he ek cloud kaa chithran
 The basic concept of cloud computing came in 1960, when John mccarthy opined that "computation might someday be organized as a public utility"; In fact the service shares traits with the bureau that came in 1960
 shabd cloud pehle se hi 1990 ke dashak ke prarambh main vyavsaayik upyog main aa gaya tha, iskaa upyog atulykaalik antaran vidha network kaa ullekh karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha

 Corporations or end users who want to avoid the circumstance of not having access to their data — or even the situation of data being lost — are typically advised to use their services First research the vendor's policies on data security
 Gartner, a technical analyst and consulting firm, gives a list of several security issues that should be discussed with a cloud computing vendor
 abhyaas main, data kii vasuuli kii kshamtaaon kaa behtareen nirdhaaran prayogon ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he; udhaaharan ke liye, puraane data ko phir se praapt karne ke liye kaha jaye, note kiya jaye ki isamen kitna samay lagata he or pushti kii jaye ki jaanch ke liye praapt data mul data se mail khaataa he
 Determining data security can be more difficult, but one approach is to encrypt the data yourself
 If you encrypt the data using a reliable algorithm, then, regardless of the service provider's security and encryption policies, the data will only be accessible with decryption keys

 In addition, the benefit of any reduction in costs should be used to account for the lack of associated control, accessibility and security risks
 chunki buniyadi saranchana of-sait he or internet ke madhyam se sulabh he, upyogkarta kahin se bhi jud sakate hai
 Nevertheless, many major cloud computing services have faced a number of problems and IT and business managers are less able to address times when they are affected
