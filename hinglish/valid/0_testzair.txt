 sharir ke bheetar in vikrutiyon kaa swaroop jab aasaani se indriya grahya hota he, tab usko sthool vikruti kehete hai tathaa sookshm swaroop kii vikruti hone par in vikrutiyon ko dekhne ke liye jab sookshmdarshi yantra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he tab usko sookshm vikruti kehete hai
 Deformations emphasize the heterogeneity of various body parts and their anatomical and morphological changes and their functional changes in diseases
 saransh main vikrutiyon kaa ullekh vibhinn angon se sambandhit hota he or rog kaa ullekh adhiktar lakshanon se sambandhit hota he
 The disease remains in the form of malformations in the body from long ago

 When complete body deformities and their causes are described according to the above general types, then it is called normal pathology and when each organ, intention or institution of the body is described independently of the above types of deformities
 Is, then it is called special pathology
 prayogshaala ke andar vibhinn parikshaon se rogi ke rog kaa adhyayan clinical pathology dwaara kiya jaataa he
 General pathology is divided into the following chapters
 aadhunik vichaarak yah maanate hai ki sujan, sajiv sharirastha koshikaon ke dwaara kisi bhi kshobh ke virodh main kii gai pratikriya maatr he
 There are four reasons for the outbreak: sujan ke pramukh chihn nimnlikhit hai : Along with this, there is a loss of activity of the organ due to some shock in the tissues and due to some colic
 sharir kaa nirmaan karanevaale vibhinn utakon ke ke hraas, vinaash tathaa kshati ko saamaanya oothkakshay kehete hai
 Causes - The following are the major causes of tissue tissue saransh main oothkakshay kaa mukhya kaaran dhamni, shiraaon tathaa keshikaon main avrodh kaa hona he
 Due to this, nutritious substance does not reach the said place
 oothkakshay ke prakaar nimnlikhit hai : It is also a tissue-specific action
 jab kisi utak kaa apakarshan kaha jaataa he, to iskaa abhipraay utak main ek vishesh prakaar kaa parivartan samajhnaa chahie, jaise vasa apakarshan kehane se kisi ootkavishesh main vasa kii upasthiti he, aisa bodh hota he, usee ke anusaar namakaran bhi hota he, jaise hriday apakarshan, mansapeshiy apakarshan, yakruti apakarshan ityadi
 In other words, when there is a change in the chemical activity of the cell due to lack of nutritious diet of tissues, it is called detraction
 isamen koshika kii purnataya mrityu ho jaati he tathaa uske protoplasm se ek nae prakaar ke rasinic padaarth kii utpatti hoti hai
 This substance is completely different from the previous structure of the cell and thus the function of the cell is completely different
 jab koshika ke andar lasika main se ek vishisht padaarth nikalakar ikattha ho jaataa he, to use ant:spandan kehete hai
 This infusion is mainly adipose, calcareous and amyloid type, whereas ablation is fatty mucoid and colloid
 rakt ke abhaav se jab utak main ek prakaar kii sadan hone lagati hai, to use koth kehete hai
 It is of two types dry koth and humid
 shushk koth - jab kisi ek bhaag kii dhamni dwaara kisi ang main rakt pahunchnaa band ho jaataa he, to shushk koth kii utpatti hoti he
 Humid dictionary - In this, the movement of blood from the veins by a particular organ towards the heart stops completely
 rakt kii us sthaan par aamad hoti he, parantu nikaas nahin hota
 Apart from the above two types of coaths, there are other types of coaths as well, such as intercostal coath, infectious coath, pneumothritis, diabetes mellitus, senescent coath, and renal disease
 jeern yaa vinasht hue utak yaa koshikaon kii kriya yathasambhav pun: praapt kii jaae, is abhipraay se jo unka punarjanan hota he, vah punarnirmaan, yaa jirnoddhar kaha jaataa he
 It is such a special state of the body in which there is growth of body tissue
 saamanyat: arbud do prakaar ke hote hai : Soft tumors - These are fatal because they do not cause any harm to life
 ghaatak arbud- jin arbudon main vighatan atyadhik hota he, unamem utak kii si akruti nahin banati
 Their composition is different from that of tissue and their growth is very rapid
 ve sharir main shighratapurvak prasaarit hokar andar hi andar swasth avyavon ko aakraant karte hai
 The action of this internal transmission is called metastasis
 is kaaran ye bahut maarak bhi hote hai or isi se inhen ghaatak, dusht, yaa chand arbud kaha jaataa he
 When there is an attack of any pathogenic bacteria in the human body, then the nature inside the body resists them the most, and in this war, the body's thick cells protect the body from disease by destroying the force of those external bacteria
 sharir ke andar se utpann isi roganashak shakti ko pratiraksha kehete hai
 There are two types of immunity: swaabhaavik pratiraksha - kisi rog ke pratirodh main sharir ke andar jo swaabhaavik shakti utpann hoti he use swaabhaavik pratiraksha kehete hai
 Earned immunity - If a person does not have the resistance to a particular disease and retrospectively by himself or by any other measures, he can be called acquired immunity
 udaahranarth, haija, chechak, motitora, titains ityadi paidaa karanevaale kuch rogaanu aise chote hai jo ek baar sharir main pravesh karne par rog paidaa kar sakate hai, parantu thodi maatra main pravisht karne par rog ke prati pratiraksha shakti utpann karte hai
 The reason for this is that a toxin produces disease in the body due to excessive intake, but the same toxin creates immunity by staying in very small amounts

 Classic Originally a term used for writers of ancient Greece and Rome and their works, but now, famous, distinguished or distinguished writers of any country and era and their works
 vartmaan arth main is shabd kaa sarvapratham prayog isa kii duusari sadi main roman lekhak oulas gelius ne kiya
 According to him, there are two categories of authors

 As far as the literary use of the word classic is concerned, despite being from the West, it is now prevalent in all the languages and literature of the world
 kisi bhi pracheen bhashaa yaa sahitya ko usase prabhavit yaa viksit kisi aadhunik bhashaa yaa sahitya ke sandarbh main ‘clasik’ kaha jaataa he
 Thus Sanskrit is referred to as 'classic' in reference to most Indian languages or literatures, or the ancient Chinese language and its literature in the context of modern Chinese language and literature
 duusari ore prayek bhashaa ke sahitya kaa kalvibhaajan kuch vishesh saahitiyik mulyon ke aadhaar par ‘clasik’ tathaa anya shabdon main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Thus itself is considered a 'classic' period within Sanskrit and ancient Chinese literature
 saath hi sanskrit ke saapeksh hindi a ‘clasik’ bhashaa or sahitya he, kintu hindu main bhi apana ‘clasik kaal’ he
 Here the term 'classic' and its values are discussed in the context in which they were developed

 In the literature of this period, the tendency of imitation and scholarship is more in place of original experiments

 Apollonius Rodeus unsuccessfully tried to keep alive and popularize the tradition of ancient heroism
 kalimakhas ke netritv main sfoot premavishyak kavitaaon kaa prachlan adhik hua
 Eratus and Nicandar are notable among other poets

 The content of all these writers was related to the life of Rome, but the form of their works has a profound influence in ancient Greek literature

 The name of Virgil, the greatest poet of Latin poetry, is associated with it

 According to scholars, the classical era of Latin literature actually comes to an end with the Silver Age, as the subsequent lateness of language and sentiment began to decline in the later Latin literature
 duusari sadi ke baad laathini sahitya par isai dharm kii prabhutaa sthapit ho gai
 This literature expresses the intense duality between the ancient Greek and Latin idol and the beliefs of the pagan tradition and Christianity

 The Renaissance is a period of new reflexes and interest in Greek and Roman literature, art and philosophy in Europe

 The awakening of this awakening was done before and in the first half of the 15th century in several cities of Italy, in which Rome and Florence were predominant

 But from the middle of the 15th century onwards, this process became so rapid and widespread that from here medieval Europe is considered a transition to modernity

 The Renaissance replaced the principle of primitiveness and inferiority as a place of faith in the sanctity of the human body and immense possibilities for the development of the individual
 yah pravriti itani prabal thi ki swayan carch ko iske saath samjhauta karnaa padaa
 According to the French scholar Jasraan, the symbol of this unquestionable triumph of cosmicism and humanism was a bare sculpture of a bronze lady, which was established after the Renaissance itself at the tomb of a pope
 punarjagran ne maanavtawaad ke saath saath pracheen greek or roman saahitiyik parampara ko bhi punarujjivit kiya, jiske falswaroop italvi sahitya ko kavy, tatak, aakhyayika, itihaas aadi kii vastu or rachana ke adarsh vidhaan praapt hue
 In addition to drawing inspiration from the works of ancient Greek and Latin litterateurs, 16th-century Italian litterateurs accepted the works of Aristotle and Horace, the Poetics and Ars Poetica, as works of poetry
 punarjagran ne hi florence main lorentson medichi ke netritv main nakeelatunavaad ko bhi janm diya, jiskaa gaharaa asar italy or europe ke anya deshon kii premasambandhi kavitaaon par padaa
 Classical Renaissance reached Italy in the 15th-16th century, France and Spain, Germany and England in 16th century by crossing the borders of Italy
 is navjagrati ne roman catholic carch ke antargat europe kii ekasutrata bhangkar in deshon kii nijee pratibha ko unmukt kiya
 That is why each of these countries molded this new consciousness into their own molds
 dharm, samskruti, sahitya, kala, vigyaan, shiksha, sabhi par is jagriti kii chhap padi
 The message of this movement was conveyed by the leaders of Italy to the countries of Europe and the leaders of Europe reached Italy to accept it
 italy ke leonardo da vinci or alaamanni france or kastiglione spain pahunche
 Great Western religious leaders Luther and brilliant humanitarian Erasmus arrived in Italy from Western Europe
 france ke plaia ke kaviyon, germany ke dharmasudhar andolan, spain kii lirik kavyadhara, england ke elizabethyugin sahitya kii mul prerana yahi navjagriti thi
 The specialty of this renaissance was that while on the one hand he presented his ancient classical ideals, on the other hand, by freeing the consciousness of the person, he also gave him the courage to go into new directions of experimentation and creation
 17veen or 18veen sadiyon main inhen aadarsho ke roodhi ban jane ke baad is rachanaatmak sphurti kaa bhi laap ho gaya
 a new suit was born, called Neoclassicism, by tying the flow of ancient classics to the pool of customs
 aksar ‘classisism’ or ‘nio-classisism’ paryaay ke rup main prayukt hote hai, kintu puraane clasikon ke adarsh or vaad main bandha jane ke baad classisism yaa nio-classisism ke aadarsho ke bhed ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The main role in establishing Neo-classicism in Europe was the 17th century French litterateurs and critics, who rigorously arranged and often inanimate mannerism by the 16th century Italian critics on the principles of ancient Greek and Roman litterateurs like Aristotle, Horace, etc
 Gave the form of french aalochanashasthri pracheen greek or roman chintakon ke paas sidhe na pahunchakar apni ruchi ke italvi aalochanashastriyon ke madhyam se pahunche, jiske falswaroop unhone kaaphi svachhndatha ke saath pracheen clasico, visheshat: arestu ke siddhanton par apni reeti-ariti aropit kar di
 In criticism, the first important propagandist of this formalism was Mallarb
 1630 se 1660 ke bich is ritivaad kaa prasar or bhi hua
 The work was carried out by Shaplain, Boylo, Rapun, Le Bosso, etc
 and was inspired and supported by the French Academy, decarte's Rationalism and the Catholic Church, established under the patronage of Louis's court
 nio-clasical aalochanashastra kaa dhyaan kavita, jisamen mahakavy or du:khant tathaa sukhaant roopak bhi shaamil the, kii ore ho gaya
 He had some simple principles, eg, poetry aims at moral education more than entertainment; Knowledge of poetry or ritual is more important than talent; Riti means imitation of Kalasikas: 'truth' is paramount in the object of poetry and Truth means universal truth felt by human beings; And in place of imagination, there should be intellectual restraint and balance; There should be clarity and brevity in the expression; There should be proper maintenance of order, compliance and balance in the composition
 sankshep main, in saadhaaran niyamon kii teen dhuriyaan thi, buddhi, nir-ksheer-vivek or kalatmak abhiruchi
 As far as poetic forms were concerned, according to the neo-classical Criticists, the elders had decided the subject, goals, effects and styles of each form
 isi aadhaar par unhone mahakavy or sukhaant naatakon ke rachanavidhan ko reetibaddh kiya
 He condemned the blending of the elements of misery in farce and farce and considered the central principle of the design of metaphor to be the connotation of time, country and event
 nio-clasical siddhanton kaa gaharaa asar tatkaaleen europea sahitya par padaa kyonki 14wein lui kaa france europe kaa saanskrithik centre tha
 18th-century English literature is a reflection of Neo-classical ideals
 spasht he ki pracheen greek or laathini clasikon or renesaan ke unke anuyaayiyon ko nio-clasical sahityakaron se ek nahin kiya ja saktaa
 On the one hand there is exploration or tradition-oriented exploration, on the other hand, the attempt to convert the achievement of this investigation into stereotypes

 The ancient classics performed their work with reference to the great traditions of literature, social life and contemplation
 nio-clasical sahityakaron main bhi yah bodh tha, kintu unke saamne ye mahan sandarbh nahin the
 Neo-classicalism is the product of an era when society goes through a period of development and becomes inertia, when it stops at the end of a closed street
 aise samay sahitya main vastu kaa sthaan gaun or rup kaa sthaan pradhan ho jaataa he
 It is a very fertile land of orthodoxy in Rupashakti literature
 yah ashyarch kii baat nahin ki pashchimi europe ke saanskrithik sankat ke is yug main angreji or anya sahitya main nia-classisism kaa punaruddhar hua
 Ezra Pound, the famous originator and theorist of modern English poetry, T
 E
 Hulsh and T
S
 Elliot attached more importance to 18th-century neo-classical English poetry than the Romantic literature developed on the basis of Renaissance's humanist tradition
 hulsh ke anusaar ‘manushya asaadhaaran rup se sthit or simit jeevadharee he, jisaki prakruti sarvatha aparivartaneey he
 Only through tradition and organization can a good thing be made in its hands'
 ‘manushya anant sambhaavnaaon kaa strot he’
 Describing this Romantic faith as mental illness and hence, he says: 'I predict that the era of dry, hard, classical poetry is coming'
 jisamen kalpana se adhik mahatv chitrakaushal kaa hoga
 Thus, the struggle of Romanticism and Classicism is not only a literary struggle but also a struggle of progress and stereotypes towards political and cultural values
 ‘clasik’ kii rudh paribhaasha ke antargat unani or roman sahitya or unke pariprekshya main europea sahitya kii hi charchaa upar kii gai he
 In the context of the above literature, Hume raised the question that Homer was read in Rome and Athens a thousand-two thousand years ago and is still read in London and Paris
 anek vibhinnataaon or parivartanon ke hote hue bhi aaj tak unka mahatv bana hua he iskaa kya kaaran he? is prashn ke uttar main yah anubhav kiya gaya ki jo sahitya kaal kii kasuti par khara utre vahi ‘clasik' he
 Therefore, it is now being understood that classic literature is one in which those elements of life must be definitely included, whose utility and meaning are indispensable for every era and country
 bhartiya sahitya ko ‘clasik’ kii isi paribhaasha kii drushti se dekha ja saktaa he
 From this point of view, Ramayana and Mahabharata fall into the ranks of the classic
 sanskrit ke anek kaavyon or mahakavyon kii gananaa uske antargat kii ja sakati he
 Kalidasa's overall literature is classic in itself but 'raghuvansh' and 'abhigyan Shakutnal' are paramount
 hindi kaa saahitiyik itihaas abhi kuch hi sau barason kaa he
 In the meantime, the type of literature that was composed mostly adopted the same focal points of Sanskrit literature, which are called rasa, sound, curvature, ritual and ornamentation
 is kaal ke lekhakon ke preranarot the sanskrit ke hrasonmukh saahitiyik acharya
 Therefore, in that period there is not much that can be called a classic

 bharat mata kii jai
 The design and design of the Sangh's prayer was first prepared in a meeting held at Sindi near Nagpur in February 1939

 Initially, prayer was made in half Marathi and half Hindi languages, but considering that there should be prayer in one form and one language in the whole country, it was translated and revised in the most popular Sanskrit language of the country
 prarthana ke ant main 'bharat mata kii jai' hindi main rakhaa gaya
 Prayer was adapted into Sanskrit by Narhari Narayan Bhide of Nagpur
 is prarthana ko sabase pehle 23 april 1940 ko pune ke sangh shiksha varg main yadav raav joshi ne vartmaan boli jane vaali lay main gaaya
 In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation tells us how the quantum state of a physical body changes over time
 It was founded by Austrian physicist Irwin Schrödinger in 1925 and published in 1926
 The equation of motion in fixed mechanics tells us about the initial state and configuration of the system in the form of the Newton second law or the Oiler Lagranzi equation
 But in the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, the wave function gives us complete information about the physical state
 The Schrödinger equation not only gives information about atomic, molecular and subatomic states, but also macro systems, possibly the entire universe

 It was here that Schrödinger drew inspiration from wave mechanics to construct an equation that could understand and understand the quantum effects seen due to particle-wave duality
 Schrödinger then used it on a Newtonian particle to connect his summation to this world

 They are: uttara raja viraat kii putree thim
 While the Pandavas were performing the unknown, Arjuna was living after assuming the name Vrihanlala
 vrihanlala ne uttara ko nrity, sangeet aadi kii shiksha di thi
 At the time when the Kauravas had taken over the cows of King Virat, Arjuna showed extraordinary courage by fighting with the Kauravas
 arjuna kii us veerta se prabhavit hokar raja viraat ne apni kanya uttara kaa vivaah arjuna se karne kaa prastaav rakhaa tha kintu arjuna ne yah kahkar ki uttara unki shishyaa hone ke kaaran unki putree ke samaan thi, us sambandh ko asweekaar kar diya tha
 Later, Uttara was married to Abhimanyu
 chakravyuuh todane ke liye jane se purv abhimanyu apni patni se vidaa lene gaya tha
 At that time, he prayed to Abhimanyu, stay with Uttara, you are with Uttara
 parakshit kaa janm inhen kii kokh se abhimanyu kii mrityu ke baad hua tha
 Uttara's brother's name was Uttara
 dow kishor kabra hindi kavi hai
 He has an important place in the topmost signatures of Sathottari Hindi-poetry

 sahityakala shri, sahitya shiromani, sahitya shri, patrkaar shri, vidyavachaspati jaisi maanad padaviyon se aap samalankrita hai
 Undoubtedly, Dr
 Kishore Kabra is truly a Saraswat and is a unique killer of mother Bharati
 shri kishor kabra pranit 'uttar mahabharat' ek garimamandit prabandh-kriti he
 It is the dignity of artistry, sense of beauty, awareness and deep life vision
 uttar mahabharat kaa upjivy bhi mahabharat ke 17 wein or 18 wein parv kaa aakhyaan he
 Its story is divided into seven circles
 mahabharat ke 18 divasiy vidhwanskaari yuddh ke ananthar avshisht paanch pandavon ke himalay-prasthaan kii katha-kavy, darshan or manovigyaan ke triveni-sangam par kahi gayi he
 The poet has attempted to sow the seeds of the past for the future on the land of the present in the North Mahabharata
 prayek pandav ek tatasth darshanik kii bhaanti mahaprayan kii bela main apane purv-krit karmo kaa paryvekshan karata he
 This part of the Pandavas' introspection is the very original origin of the poet
 swayan kavi kaa kathan he - uttar mahabharat arthath shatvikaron ke shaman or shaddarshan kii prapti kaa bimbaatmak aakhyaan he
 In fact, it is a psychological analysis of the nature of six persons
 'uttar ramayana' bhi paanch sargo main vibhakt mahakavy str kaa garimayukta prabandh-kavy he, jisamen kavi ne ramakatha se sambandhit kuch shaashvat prashnon ke samaadhaan khojane kaa pramanik praytn kiya he
 The poet has composed this epic in his regional and fluent language-style
 nishchay hi uttar ramayana main roopayit ramakatha na to akshep-katha he, na kshepak-katha he or na hi koi kalank-katha he
 It is, of course, an age-related re-evaluation of sita-ram's glory story
 swayan kavi ke matanusaar, yah maanav kii purnataa-yatra main vishwa-itihaas ke sabase bade tyaag, balidaan evam tirohit hone kii sangharmpurn or utaar-chadhaav vaali tathaa maanav-man ke kai yogon se bhari pariksha-katha he
 Dr
 Kishore Kabra is a strong poet of management consciousness

 xxrep 4 
 He is certainly the best managing poet of the eighth decade of the modern era
 dow kabra-rachit khandakavy 'paritaap' ke paanch kshan mahabharat ke amar paatr bhishma pitamah ke manastaap evam paritaap par aadhaarit he
 The poet has re-evaluated Bhishma's pledge to remain unmarried for a lifetime in the Khandakavya presented, as well as put a tremendous question mark on his traditional bright character in the light of psychological truth
 mahabharat yuddh ke ananthar kurushetra kii ranbhumi main sharashaiya par lete huye mumursh bhishma pitamah asay manastaap se aakraant hai or anek antarvirodhon ke bich tadap rahe hai
 Life has become a sin and death curse for them
 aakhir aisa kyon? isliye ki bhishma ne apane rugn or kshatveery sautele bhai vichitraveery ke liye kashiraj kii teenon rajkumariyon kaa apharan karke baari adoordarshita kaa parichay diya tha
 Of these, two respectively received Pandurogadh son and blind son
 kahin kii nahin rahi to amba
 Bhishma turned her down on the pretext of her vow, and as a result she continued to burn in the fire of life and vengeance
 bhishma ko bhi amba ke prati anyaay kaa bheeshan paritaap he
 Through the same spirit of Bhishma, the poet has saved another neglected woman Amba
 dow kabra pranit khandakavy 'dhanush-bhang' kaa prerana-strot ramayana he
 The entire story of the bow-break is divided into five explosions, kiwon-five sergo
 ek yugadrushtaa kavi ke anuroop kabra ji ne prastut khandakavy main ramayana kii ek sookshm mithkeey pariklpana ke sahare yug-bodh kaa sannivesh kiya he
 Sita is standing with a garland in her hands to remember Shri Ram
 sita ke palak jhapakane ke keval ek kshan ko kavi ne vyapak yug-sandarbho main dekha he
 The purpose of this Khandakavya is to represent the story of the bow and plow from the past twenty-one generations in a symbolic manner
 kaviver kabra ji ke khandakavy 'naro vaa kunjaro vaa' kaa utsa bhi mahabharat kii katha main miltaa he
 The protagonist of this Khandakavya is Dronacharya
 ye ve dron hai, jinhone apane putr ashwatthama ko doodh ke sthaan par aataa ghol-ghol kar pilaayaa tha
 On hearing the news of the death of the same Ashwatthama, Drona collapsed like a sprained tree, because he could not bear the trauma of son-disconnection in the ill-tempered mood of a male and female
 kavi ke sammukh dron kaa vyaktitv ek prashn ke rup main tikaa hua tha
 Naro va Kunjaro va Khandakavya is the epitome of Dronacharya's philosophy of life resting on a semi-state, which starts at the mouth of milk and ends at the ocean of blood
 'jalte panghat : bujhate maraghat' dow kabra kii ikyavan kavitaaon kaa sankalan he
 Some poems have also been written in Muktchand
 kavitaaon main kavi ke katu-madhur anubhavon kii pratidhwaniyaan spasht sunai padati hai
 The poet has sung songs of faith and faith in these poems despite the prevailing deception, frustration and infidelity in society and country in the name of modernity
 'sarathi, mere rath ko lautaa de' main kavi kaa kavitv teen dhuriyon arthath kavita, geet or ghazal ke teen rangon main abhivyakt hua he
 The poems of this compilation have a much broader perspective, reflecting the clear narratives of slander and evil prevalent in religion, society, politics, life, literature, etc
 sangrah kii lambii kavita 'sarathi mere rath ko lautaa de' aadhunik-bodh se anupranit ek shashakt or ullekith kavita he
 The poems of 'broken Sea' contain the philosophical experiences of the poet and the philosophy of adult language-craft
 vyakti, samaaj or raashtra ke prati kavi kaa daayitv bodh yahaan or bhi teevr rup main vyakt hua he
 How touching is the poet's picture of today's man imprisoned in life's prison: shahar kii vishakt sabhyataa or usamen sarapagark nagarikon ke prati kavi kaa yah chutila vyangy dekhie or agyeyaji kii 'saanp' sheershak kavita kaa samaran kiijie : 'ritmati Hai Pyaas' is a pure song-collection, in which a pictorial and imaginary depiction of a symmetrical nature is made by using subaltern and symbolic experiments
 'haashie kii kavitaayen' kavy-sankalan ko prabandhkaar dow kabra ke kavi-karm kaa upotpaada kaha ja saktaa he
 It contains 301 epics of the poet, which are, in fact, contemplations related to the contemporary perception generated in the heart of the poet during management
 'kishor-satsai' 707 dohon kaa sangrah he
 Except Sanskrit and Prakrit, an intact tradition of Satsai is seen in Hindi from the Middle Ages till today
 'kishor satsai' usee sudeergh parampara kii ek mahatvapurn kadi he
 Kabraji is familiar with the power of Doha verses
 nai peedi kii niyati kaa isse sahaj, sundar or sankshipt kintu purna chitra or kya hoga? In the seven steps of Satsai, it is as if the poet has expressed his great Jagiivan-related experience
 doha jaisaa pracheen chand sweekaar karke usamen kathy or shilp kaa naavinya sampurna arth-gaurav ke saath sanjo paanaa dow kishor kabra jaise yugadharmi evam siddhhast kavi ke boote kii hi baat he
 'I am a mirror' is the poet's latest collection of poems
 prastut sangrah kii kavitaaon main bhaavon ke tatkaapan he to vyangy kaa chutilaapan bhi he
 Whether poetry is inspired by social perception or combined with individual consciousness, a deep life-vision of the poet remains connected everywhere
 ras-paripaak, gun-garima, lakshanik prayog, bimb-yojana evam pratik-vidhaan aadi kii drushti se kabra ji kii kavita samrudh he
 Satire is the essence of his poetry
 kabra ji kii kavita kii cendravarti visheshta he unka maanavtaavaadi drushtikon or maanav-mulyon kii pratishtha ke liye unki nirantar chintaa
 This is the reason that whether they bring the poetry for their poetry from the archaic past or take it from their surroundings, but at the center remains a human being
 aaj ke maanav kii samasyaon ko puri eemaandaaree or nishtha se roopayit karnaa ve apni rachanadharmita or apana yugdharm sweekaar karte hai
 It has been said that 'prose kavinam nikam vaddanti'
 padya ke saath-saath gadhy main bhi usee adhikaar or kshamta se likhane vaale dow kabra ji kaa gadhy-lekhan, bal-sahitya se lekar nibandhon evam shodh-prabandhon jaise praudh-sahitya tak parivyapt he
 Your first prose treatise, published in 1975, is 'ritikalin Kavya Kalyankalankar'
 is granth main kabra ji ne vaidic kaal se adyavadhi shabdalankaron kaa vaigyanik paryvekshan prastut kiya he
 The same is true with respect to literary essays
 swayan kabra ji kaa vidhaan apane is niabandh-sangrah ke sabandh main uddharaneey he - isamen kavi he, kalam he, kaagaj he
 There is life in this, there is the world, there is Jaganniyanta
 gadhykar kabra ji ke gadhy-shilp kaa sarvaadhik manohar rup hamen unki laghukthaon main dekhne ko miltaa he
 These short stories actually depict Kabra ji's prose with a crafted effort in which he wants to cover 'one pinch of the sky', 'one piece of land' and 'drop by drop bitter truth'
 aapaki kai laghukathaayen apane samakaleen bodh, tatakepan or chutilepan ke kaaran urdu ke saadat hossain manton kii yaad dilaati hai
 Dr
 Kishore Kabra's unbroken poetry-practice has made a successful journey from Palika to khanda-kavya and Muktak to Epic
 unki kavy-sadhana kii safalataa kaa yah sabase bada pramaan he ki hindi ke murdhanya kaviyon or suprasiddh sahityakaron ne unki kavy-kala kii muktakanth se prashansa kii he
 Mr
 Naresh Mehta and Chandrakant Bandivadekar are fascinated by the symbols and metaphors of the poet, while Sudhi critic Dr
 Kumar Vikal is keen on Dr
 Kabra's management and mythology

 Thus the Dalit representative was to be elected only by the vote of the Dalits

 Whereas, there was no objection from Gandhi about this right given to Indian Christians, Muslims and Sikhs
 " unhone yah bhi kaha ki gandhi koi amar vyakti nahin hai
 How many such people were born in India and went away
 ambedkar ne kaha ki gandhi kii jaan bachaane ke liye vah daliton ke hiton kaa tyaag nahin kar sakate
 Now Gandhi's health was continuously deteriorating due to the death fast
 gandhi ke praanon par baari sankat aan padaa

 Ambedkar was indifferent to the deal, calling it Gandhi's fast to play a drama played by Gandhi to deprive the untouchables of their political rights and pressurize them to withdraw from their demands

 Baba Saheb Ambedkar made many efforts to improve Hindu religion and Hindu society, to achieve equality and respect, while being under Hindu religion for 10-12 years, but the heart of the upper caste Hindus did not change
 ulte unhen nindit kiya gaya or hindu dharm vinaashak tak kaha gaya
 After that he said that, "we made every effort and satyagraha to achieve the level of equality in Hindu society, but all proved fruitless
 hindu samaaj main samanta ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 "hindu society used to say that" humans are for religion "while Ambedkar believed that" religions are for humans
 " " ambedkar ne kaha ki aise dharm kaa koi matlab nahin jisamen manushyata kaa kuch bhi mulya nahin
 There is no point in living in such a religion which does not allow the followers of their own religion to get religious education, interrupts their jobs, insults them and even gives them water
 ambedkar ne hindu dharm tyaagane kii ghoshnaa kisi bhi prakaar kii dushmani va hindu dharm ke vinaash ke liye nahin kii thi balki unhone iskaa faisla kuch moulik siddhanton ko lekar kiya jinka hindu dharm main bilkul talmail nahin tha

He also called upon his followers to convert to any religion other than Hinduism
 unhone apni is baat ko bharat bhar main kai saarvajanik sabhaaon main bhi doharaaya

 Ambedkar made a deep study of all the major religions of the world between 21 years after he declared his conversion

 buddha dharm pragna, karunaa or samta kii shiksha detaa he
 He said that man wants these things for auspicious and happy life
 devtaa or aatma samaaj ko nahin bachaa sakate
 According to Ambedkar, true religion is the one whose center is man and morality, based on science or intellectual element, not God, the center of religion, liberation of soul and salvation

 Aristotle has said that "if there is a man who cannot live in society, or who does not need society, because he is perfect in himself, then he must be a wild animal or deity
" ” prayek samaaj main vyavastha banaaye rakhane ke liye koi na koi nikaay yaa sanstha hoti he, chaahe use nagar-rajya kahen athwa raashtra-rajya
 The state functions through government and administration
 rajya ke uddeshy or nitiyaan kitni bhi prabhaavshaalee, aakarshak or upyogi kyon nahon, unase us samay tak koi laabh nahin ho saktaa, jab tak ki unako prashasan ke dwaara kaary rup main parinit nahin kiya jaye
 Therefore it becomes necessary to study the organization, behavior and processes of administration
 charlsbiard ne kaha he ki “koi bhi vishay itnaa adhik mahatvapurn nahin he jitna ki prashasan he
 The future of the state and government, even the civilization itself, depends on our ability to develop science, philosophy and art of administration capable of performing the functions of civil society
 ” donham ne vishwaspurvak bataaya ki “yadi hamaari sabhyataa asafal hogi to yah mukhyatah prashasan kii asafalataa ke kaaran hoga
 If a military officer accidentally misses Anubam, the third world war will begin and in a few moments the possibility of destruction of developed civilizations will arise
 ” As the nature and activities of the state have expanded, the importance of administration has increased

 The situation is that in the absence of administration, our own life seems as dreadful as death and as helpless as a broken star

 In fact, administration is present in all the planned tasks, whether they are private or public
 use prayek janasamudaay kii saamaanya ichchhaaon kii purti main nirat vyavastha mana ja saktaa he
 Every political system needs administration, be it democratic or socialist or dictatorship
 ek drushti se, prashasan kii aavashyaktaa loktantr se bhi adhik samaajawaadee vyavasthaaon ko rahati he
 All the workers of socialist systems are accomplished by them
 loktantratmak vyavasthaaon main vyakti nijee taur par tathaa soochna samudaay bhi saarvajanik jivan main apana yogadan dete hai
 Although it can be said that the task of administration is more difficult in democracy than socialism
 samaajwaad main prashasan puri tarah se ek raajnneetik dal dwaara niyantrit or nirdeshit samaan lakshyon ko puraa karne ke liye samoohon dwaara sahyogpurn dhang se kii gayi kriyaayein hi prashasan he

 According to the Negro, "administration is the use and organization of man and material to achieve the goal
 ” white ke vichaaron main, vah “kisi vishisht uddeshy athwa lakshya kii prapti ke liye bahut se vyaktiyon kaa nirdesan, niyantran tathaa samanvayan kii kala he
 " uparyuktaparibhaashaon kii drushti se, prashasan ke saamaanya lakshan agralikhit rup se bataaye ja sakate hai - All these characteristics can be seen in tw's definition that "administration is an inclusive process of integration of human efforts to achieve desired results
" ” All these definitions contain very broad interpretations of administration
 jab ham keval saarvajanik nitiyon athwa lokanitiyon ke kriyanvayan se sambandhit prashasan kii baat karte hai to ise “saarvajanik prashasan” yaa ‘lokprashasan’ kaha gaya he
 This is where public administration becomes distinct and distinct from general "administration"
 lokprashasan ke siddhanth evam karypranaliyaan anya kshetron main uplabdh prashasano ko adhikadhik maatra main prabhavit karti ja rahi hai
 In White's words, public administration "consists of activities intended to carry out or implement public policy
" ” woodro wilson ke anusaar, “lokprashasan vidhi athwa kanoon ko vistrut evam krambaddh rup main kriyanvit karne kaa kaam he
 Every action to implement the law is an administrative action
 ” dymock ne bataaya he ki “prashasan kaa sambandh sarkaar ke “kya” or “kaise” se he
 "what" refers to the knowledge contained in the subject, that is, specific knowledge that gives the administrator the ability to carry out his / her work in any administrative area
 “kaise” se abhipraay prabandh karneki us kala evam siddhanton se he, jiske anusaar, samuhik yojanaon ko safalataa kii ore le jaaya jaataa he
 "harvey Walker said that" the government does what it takes to make the law functional
 ” vilobi ke matanusaar, “prashasan kaa kaaryvastav main sarkaar ke vyavasthapika ang dwaara ghoshit or nyaaypalika dwaara nirmit kanoon ko prashasit karne se sambaddh he
 "persimquin said that" Public administration is related to the functions of the government, whether they are executed by the Center or by the local body
 vyapak gatividhi ke rup main waldo ne ise “boddhikta kii ucch maatra yukt sahyogpurn maanviya-kriya” kaha he
 From the point of view of theory and analysis, public administration and private administration are the only two distinct forms of general administration, but fundamental similarities are found in these two forms
 vartmaan samay main, inke madhya chali aa rahi asamantaayein kramshah kam hoti ja rahi hai
 Similarly, management is also the operational and instructional part of it, not separate from administration
 lok prashasan kaa vishay bahut vyapak or vividhtapurna he
 Its theory is interdisciplinary as it covers many social sciences such as economics, political science, management and sociology within its scope
 lok prashasan yaa sushasan ke kendriya tatv puri duniya main samaan hi hai - dakshata, mitvyayita or samta uske muladhar hai
 Differences in the arrangements of different countries are unavoidable depending on the nature of governance, level of economic development, political and socio-cultural factors, influences of the past and future goals or dreams
 loktantr main lok prashasan kaa uddeshy aise uchit sadhano dwaara, jo paardarshee tathaa suspasht hon, adhiktam janata kaa adhiktam kalyaan he
 According to American scholar Woodrow Wilson, it is more difficult to run a constitution than it is to make it
 chunki samvidhan ke kriyanvayan main prashasan kii bhoomika hoti he isliye prashasan ko ek vyaavhaarik anushaasan mana jaataa he, jiske gambhir adhyayan kii aavashyaktaa he
 Wilson's main message was that public administration should be separated from politics
 haalanki raajnneeti prashasan ke kaary nirdhaarit kar sakati he, phir bhi prashaanik anushaasan ko apane kaary se vichlit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Whether public administration is art or science, it is a practical scripture, which is deeply connected to the ubiquitous politics and state activities
 vyavhaar main bhi lok prashasan ek sarv-samaveshi shaastra ban chukaa he, kyonki yah janm se lekar mrityu tak vyakti ke jivan ko prabhavit karata he
 In fact it can affect a person even before her birth, by policies such as a ban on fetal testing or the provision of health services for women and children
 'lok prashasan' ke arth ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhane ke liye ‘prashasan’ or ‘lok prashasan’ main vibhed samajhnaa aavashyak haih There is a sharp disagreement among scholars regarding the nature of public administration whether public administration should be placed in the category of science or in the category of art
 isi matbhed ke aadhaar par vidwaanon ko chaar shreniyon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he: Thinkers consider public administration as science
 lok prashasan ko vigyaan na maanane vaale vichaarak
 Thinkers consider public administration as art
 lok prashasan ko kala va vigyaan donon kii shrenee main rakhane vaale vichaarak
 In the present times, the role of public administration has become very wide and complex
 niti nirmaan kii prakriya or vibhinn samasyaon ko sulajhane main prashaasak sthai rup se bhaag lene lage hai
 It is therefore necessary that all administrators are better aware of the decision making process
 saath hi unhen yah bhi pataa hona chahie ki samasya samaadhaan main mulyon evam tathyon kii bhoomika kya ho sakati he
 Public services are based on legitimate authority, which has been given proper rights, necessary security and adequate facilities for the execution of works
 atah in sevaaon main karyrat loksevakon ke uttardaayitv bhi sunishchit hone chahie
 Public servants should be given guidelines regarding their functions and professional codes through a balanced structure of public service values
 saamanytah nitishastra kaa taatpary un naitik mulyon se he jo logon ke vyavhaar ko nirdeshit evam sanskrit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 When these moral values are discussed in the context of administration, it is called "administrative ethics"
 aadhunik loksevaayen ek peshey kaa rup dhaaran kar chuki hai, atah prashasnic nitishastra kii maang uthne lagi he
 Germany is the first country to develop a professional form of public services and a professional code of conduct for public servants
