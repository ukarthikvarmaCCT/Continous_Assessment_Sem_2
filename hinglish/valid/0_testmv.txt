 In order to know the history and the condition of the fort and the pond today, after the rain, made up my mind to see it in the greenery
 Adivasis who have a long standing relationship with the forests
 satapurachal ke ghaney jangalo ke bich-bich sthit raja il kaa kila aaj bhi bhale chaaro ore hare bhare khet or khalihaano se ghira ho lekin beete kal vah jangal or junglee jaanavaro se ghira hua tha
 Being a tribal, the entrance of King Il's fort was 70 to 80 feet high, he was not affected by any direct attack
 lagbhag do dhaai sau bade majboot pattharon ko kalatmak rup se tarashkar unka upyog shandaar sidhippon ke nirmaan main kiya gaya tha
 The distance from the entrance to the king's palace is four and a half hundred yards
 adhik oonchai par bane raaj il ke is kile se puraa aasapaas kaa kshetra dikhaai pad jaataa he
 Even after keeping a close watch on all the suspicious activities reaching the fort, this fort has been attacked many times only due to the hidden treasures and philosopher's stone in this palace, which neither Mughal nor today's greedy wrote until these lines were written
 To the man who in search of it has turned the entire fort into a ruin

51 Pandit Balachandra Siddhanthastri was a philologist and scholar of India who worked as a 'bridge' among the ancient and new scholars of Jainism
 indra hindu dharm main sabhi devataaon ke raja kaa sabase ucch pad tha jisaki ek alag hi chunaav-paddati thi
 a clear description of this election method is not available
 vaidic sahitya main indra ko sarvocch mahatta praapt he lekin puranic sahitya main inaki mahatta nirantar ksheen hoti gayi or tridevon kii shreshthata sthapit ho gayi
 About one-fourth of the Sukta of the Rig Veda is related to Indra
 250 sookhton ke atirikt 50 se adhik mantron main uskaa stvan praapt hota he
 He is the most popular and important deity of the Rigveda
 use aaryon kaa rashtriya devtaa bhi kah sakate hai
 Primarily, he is the god of rain, who fights with a monster of light or darkness and makes blocked water or light uninterrupted
 vah gaun rup se aaryon kaa yuddh-devtaa bhi he, jo adivaasiyon ke saath yuddh main un aaryon kii sahaayta karata he
 The depiction of Indra's humanistic form is visible
 uske vishaal sharir, sheersh bhujaaon or bade udar kaa bahudhaa ullekh praapt hota he
 There is also a description of his lips and jaws
 uskaa varna harith he
 Her hairstyle and beard are also green
 vah swechha se vividh rup dhaaran kar saktaa he
 The Rigveda also sheds light on the birth of Indra
 puure do sookt indra ke janm se hi sambandhit hai
 a cow named 'nishtigri' or 'shavasi' has been described as her mother
 uske pita ‘dyuh’ yaa ‘twashta’ hai
 At one place he is said to have originated from 'som'
 uske janm ke samay dyava-prithvi kaanp uthi thi
 The birth of Indra can be considered as a symbol of the cloud of electricity
 indra ke sage-sambandhiyon kaa sankshipt vivaran is prakaar he
 Agni and Pushan are his brothers
 isi prakaar indrani uski patni he
 Possibly the name 'indrani' is from the traditional form of the feminine name of the man, the original name could be something else
 marudgan uske mitra tathaa sahaayak hai
 He is also conceived in conjunction with Varuna, Vayu, Soma, Jupiter, Pushan and Vishnu
 He is the image of the Sun in the three four suktas
 indra ek vrihadaakaar devtaa he
 His body is at least ten times the expanse of the Earth
 vah sarvaadhik shaktiman he
 That is why he is the only ruler and controller of the entire world
 uske vividh virud shacheepati, shatakratu or shakr, aadi uski vipula shakti ke hi prakaashak hai
 Somaras are Indra's favorite drink
 vah vikat rup se somras kaa paan karata he
 That gives him a boost
 vrutra ke saath yudhke avasar par puure teen sarovaron ko usne pikar som-rahit kar diya tha
 In the 119th Sukta of the tenth circle, Indra can be seen by eloquently describing his heroic deeds and power in the form of a welcome speech made by drinking soma
 som ke prati vishesh aagrah ke kaaran hi use som kaa abhishav karne vaale athwa use pakaane vaale yajmaan kaa rakshak batalaaya gaya he
 The famous ordnance of Indra is 'vajra', which can be considered integral with the electric strike
 indra ke vajra kaa nirmaan ‘twashta’ naamak devtaa-vishesh dwaara kiya gaya tha
 Indra has also sometimes been described as having a bow and arrow and a curb
 uskaa rath svarnabh he
 The chariot carved by the two green varna horsemen was constructed by the dev-shilpi Ribhus
 indrakrut vrutra-vadh rugveda main bahudhaa or bahushah varnit or ullikhit he
 Inspired by the drunkenness of Soma, often with the deserts, he invades the demons called ‘vrittra’ or ‘ahi’ and slays them with his thunderbolt and penetrates the mountain to intercept blocked waters similar to the cows
 ukt daityon kaa awaas-sthal ‘parvat’ meghon ke atirikt kuch nahin he, jinka bhedan vah jal-vimochan hetu karata he
 Similarly, stone rocks that block cows are also water-proof clouds
 megh hi ve prasaad bhi hai jinamein purvokt daitya nivas karte hai
 The number of these prasadas has been stated somewhere 90, somewhere 99 and some 100, which, after demolition, Indra holds the 'purbhid'
 vrutra yaa ahi ke vadhapurvak jal-vimochan ke saath-saath prakaash ke anavaruddh bana diye jane kii baat bhi bahudhaa varnit he
 By killing that vritra or ahi, Indra makes the Sun visible to everyone
 yahan par ukt vrutra yaa ahi se abhipraay yaa to surya prakaash ke avarohak megh se he, yaa phir nishakalik andhkaar se
 The cows which are mentioned along with the Sun and the Ushas are the replicas of the rays of the early morning sun, which come out of their Krishna abode
 is prakaar indra kaa gopapatitv bhi suprakat ho jaataa he
 Apart from the slaughter of Vritra and Ahi, many other anecdotes are also available in relation to Indra
 ‘sarama’ kii sahaayta se usne ‘pani’ naamak daityon dwaara bandi banaai gai gaayon ko chin liya tha
 The demolition of 'ushas' chariot, the theft of a circle of the chariot of the Sun, mon-vijay etc
 anecdotes are also available
 indra ne compymaan bhootal or chalyman parvaton ko sthir banaaya he
 Like leather, he has spread the earth's earth
 jis prakaar ek dhuree se donon pahiye nikaal diye jaayan, usee prakaar usne dhuloak or prithvi ko pruthak kar diya he
 Indra is very aggressive
 swarg kii shaanti ko bhang karne vaala vahi ekmaatr devtaa he
 He fought with many gods
 ushas ke rath ko usne bhang kiya, surya ke rath kaa ek chakra usne churaayaa, apane anuyaayi maruton ko usne maar daalane kii dhamkee di
 He killed his father 'twashtha'
 anek daityon ko bhi usne parajeet or vinasht kiya, jisamen se vrutra, ahi, shambar, rohin ke atirikt uran vishwaroop, arbud, bal, vyansh or namuchi pramukh hai
 He also defeated hostile slaves or dasyus of Aryans in wars
 kam se kam 5 xxrep 4 0 anaryon kaa vinaash uske dwaara kiya gaya
 Indra has always been a protector, assistant and friend of his worshipers
 vah dasyuon ko bandi bana kar unki bhoomi aadi apane bhakton main vibhakt kar detaa he
 He makes the provider of the sacrifice with wealth
 uski is daansheeltaa ke kaaran hi uski oopaadhi ‘maghavan’ kii sarthakata he
 Indra's association with many historical men is also mentioned
 uski hi sahaayta se divodas ne apane das-shatru tathaa kulitar ke putr ‘shambar’ ko parajeet kiya
 Both 'turvash' and 'yadu' transported Indra across the rivers
 das nripatiyon ke viruddh yuddh main raja sudas kii usne sahaayta kii
 Thus Indra is the supreme deity of the Rigveda, whom Maxmular is the covenant of the sun, the god of Roth clouds and lightning, Benfe the symbol of the rainy sky, Grossman the symbol of the bright sky, the symbol of Hapkins lightning and Macdonal and Keith etc
 from the western to Acharya Baldev Upadhyaya
 Indian scholars consider the god of rain
 indra vrihadaakaar he
 Gods and humans do not reach the limits of his power
 vah sundar mukh vaala he
 His armament is Vajra or Sharu
 uski bhujaayen bhi vajravat pusht evam kathor hai
 He is the seventh numbered ancestral and is the ultimate record
 ‘nrimanasya mahna sa janaas indrah’ kah kar swayan gritsamad rishi ne uske balavikram kaa udghosh kar diya he
 The mountains tremble with him
 dyava-pruthivi arthath vahaan ke log bhi indra ke bal se bhay-bhit rahete hai
 He accomplishes his goal by conquering the wealth of enemies, in the same way that a hunter with the help of Kukkurs, slaughter a mrigadik, accomplishes his goal or the conquered gambler in the same way as the conquered stake money
 It becomes autonomous by incorporating itnaa hi nahin vah shatruon kii poshak samruddhi ko nasht-vinasht bhi kar daalata he
 He is a formidable warrior and performs violence similar to Vrkha in battle
 sabase badi baat to yah he ki vah ‘manaswan’ he
 Indra is the protector, assistant and friend of his devotees
 kaha bhi he ki--‘yo brahmano nadhamanasy kireh xxrep 13 
 avita’
 Vijayalabha is impossible without his help
 is liye yoddha-gana vijay ke liye or apni raksha ke liye uskaa aavahan karte hai
 This thing becomes even more clear with the following mantra: - 'ya krndasi santhi vivahte parevatara ubhaya amitrah
 samaann chidrathmasthivansaa naanaa havete sa janaas indrah
 
 ’ Indra helps the Aryans in the war against the non-aryans and makes them victorious
 etdarth vah vastuon kaa hanan evam apane apujakon va virodhiyon kaa vadh karata he
 He who delighted in him, enriched and unhappy on him, makes him a cult
 uske tattad gunon ke prabhaav se ashv, go, gram evam rathadi uske vash main rahete hai
 Thus he is representative of Nikhil world
 devtaa tak uski krupa ke paatr hai
 Indra has given stability to the unstable Earth
 idhar-udhar udate-phirte parvaton ke pankh-chhedan kar indra ne hi unhen tattat sthaan par prasthaapit kiya he
 He also shocked the world and thus created space
 do meghon ke madhya main vaidyut agni athwa do prastar-khandon ke madhya main saamaanya agni kaa janak indra hi he
 Indra has also been called the originator of Sun and Wind Usha
 vah antariksh-gat athwa bhootalvarti jalon kaa prerak he
 That is why he is considered the god of rain
 prithvi ko hi nahin pratyut sampoorn lokon ko sthir karne vaala athwa unhen rachane vaala bhi indra se bhinn koi or nahin he
 By this, even if the meaning of 'he made all things moving', Indra's glory does not decrease
 indra ne bhayavshaat parvaton main chhipe hue ‘shambar’ naam ke daitya ko 40 wein varsh dhund nikaala or uskaa vadh kar diya
 He also killed a demon named 'ahi' who performed forcefully
 ukt ‘ahi’ ko maar kar indra ne samarpanshil jalon ko athwa ganga aadi saat nadiyon ko pravaahit kiya
 Rahasin Asura ascending into heaven without killing Indra with his thunderbolt
 bal naamak daitya ne asankhya gaayon ko apane baade main niruddh kar rakhaa tha
 Indra has the credit for taking out those cows for the welfare of the people
 kuch vidvan ahi-vinaash, vrutra-vadh, shambar-sanhaar evam bal-vimardanadi kaa acyaropan karke surya rup main indra dwaara dhruvapradeshy andhkaar kaa naash athwa jalon ko jamaa dene vaali ghor sardi kaa vinaash athwa ahirupi meghon kaa vimardan karke jal-vimochan athwa balarupi meghon se aachchann surya kii kiranrupi gaayon ke vimukt kiye jane kii kalpana karte hai, jo satya se adhik dur nahin prathit hota
 By saying 'yah Sompa', the sage has also pointed towards Indra's paranoia
 ‘som’ indra kaa parampriy peya padaarth he
 No other deity like him can perform mon-paan
 ‘som’ use yudhon ke liye shakti or sphurti pradaan karata he
 Because of being a som-savi, Indra is loved by those who worship Som or cook it and prove it
 aise logon kii vah raksha karata he
 Not only this, he also rewards such dear people with wealth
 yah baat duusari he ki vah som paayi he, apane apujakon kaa apane aayudh vajra se vadh karata he, shudron ko adhogati pradaan karne vaala athwa apane apujakon ko narak pradaan karne vaala he, phir bhi vah apane anya sadgunon ke kaaran sarvatha poojaneey he
 The creatures of the earth always bow down to him
 log usase yah prarthana kiya karte hai ki ‘he indra! sundar putr-pautradi se yukt hokar tathaa tumhaare priypaatr bane hue ham sadaa tumhaari prarthana main tatpar rahen
 ' is prakaar spasht he ki indra vaidic devi-devataaon main sarvopari or sarvottam sthaan kaa adhikari he
 Vrittravadha has great importance in Indra's Charitavali
 rugveda main indra kaa naam saat dev-yugmon main bhi aata he
 In such pairs, 11 Suktas are for indra-agni, 9 Sukta for indra-varuna, 7 for indra-vayu, 2 indra-som, 2 indra-jupiter, 1 indra-vishnu and 1 Sukta for indra-pushan
 
 inamen se sabake saath indra kii samanta hone ke saath bhinnataayen bhi hai
 For example, the combination of Indra and Varuna can be taken
 yadhyapi varun kaa varnan kaaphi kam sookhton main he, parantu ve indra ke baad sarvaadhik mahneey maane gayi hai
 There is a joint description of Indra and Varuna in the 9 Suktas
 donon main anek samantaayein hai
 It is said that Indravarun, the suzerain of the world, dug the paths of the corridors and made the Sun move in the Dulok
 ve vrutra ko pachhadte hai
 Are helpful in war
 upaskon ko vijay pradaan karte hai
 Krukkarma throws his unfailing thunderbolt at Palmers
 in samaantaaon ke baavjood donon main kai vaishamy bhi hai :- According to the natural theme in the Upanishads, sometimes, Indra is also shown to be eager to attain knowledge
 chaandogopanishad se aisi ek katha di ja rahi he :-prajapati kii ukti thi ki paparahit, jarashunya, mrityu-shok aadi vikaron se rahit aatma ko jo koi jaan letaa he, vah sampurna lok tathaa sabhi kaamanaayon ko praapt kar letaa he
 Hearing the utterances of Prajapati, both the deity and the asuras became eager to know that soul, so Indra, the king of the gods, and Virochan, the king of the asuras, approached the Prajapati with mutual jealousy
 donon ne battis varsh tak brahmacharya paalan kiya, taduparant prajapati ne unke aane kaa prayojan poocha
 Knowing his curiosity, Prajapati asked him to look at himself in the water supplied with water and told him that he is a soul
 donon sakoron main apana-apana pratibimb dekhakar, santusht hokar chal pade
 Prajapati thought that whether he was a god or an asura, he would be defeated without interviewing the soul
 virochan santusht man se asuron ke paas pahunche or unhen bataaya ki aatma hi poojaneey he
 By taking care of him, man obtains both worlds
 devataaon ke paas pahunchne se purv hi indra ne sochaa ki sakore main aabhushan pahanakar sajjit rup dikhataa he, khandit deh kaa khandit rup, andhe kaa andhaa rup, phir yah ajar-amar aatma kaise hui? ve pun: prajapati ke paas pahunche
 Prajapati again kept Indra with him for thirty-two years, and then said - 'the one who is worshiped in the dream is the wanderer, the soul, the nectar, the abbey and the Brahma
 ' indra pun: punah shankaa lekar prajapati kii seva main prastut hue
 In this way, by keeping Indra in celibacy for thrice thirty-two years and once for five years, Prajapati made him fully aware of the nature of the soul in this way: - puranic devmandal main indra kaa vah sthaan nahin he jo vaidic devmandal main he
 The importance of trimurti-brahma, Vishnu and Shiva increases in the mythological pantheon
 indra phir bhi devadheeraj mana jaataa he
 He lives in Amaravati, the capital of Dev-lok
 yaheen nandan van he, parijaat tathaa kalpavriksha he
 Sudharma is his council of ministers and his cabinet
 shachi athwa indrani patni, airavat hathi tathaa astr vajra athwa ashani he
 The name of his horse is Uchhaiःrāva
 jab bhi koi maanav apni tapasya se indrapad praapt karnaa chahta he to indra kaa singhaasana sankat main pad jaataa he
 In order to protect his throne, Indra is often found to be seductive by captivating the ascetics
 puraanon main is sambandh kii anek kathaayen milti hai
 The mythical Indra is depicted as a powerful, prosperous and luxurious king
 anek shaktiyon se yukt tathaa maanya raja hone par bhi kabhi-kabhi inhen asanyat evam uddhat bhi dikhaaya gaya he, jiske kaaran inkaa patan bhi hote rahaa he
 a story of the fall from Durvasa's curse is given further
 ek baar durvasa rishi ne vidyadhri se praapt santanak pushpon kii ek maala aashirwad ke saath indra ko diya
 Indra had such an item of opulence that he placed that flower on his elephant's forehead
 pushp ke prabhaav se hathi uski sugandh se aakarshith hokar hokar use soonghakar prithvi par phenk diya
 Indra was unable to handle it
 durvasa ne unhen shrihin hone kaa shraap diya
 Amravati also became extremely corrupt
 indra pehle brihaspati kii or phir brahma kii sharan main pahunche
 All the gods went to Vishnu
 unhone lakshmi ko sagar-putree hone kii ajna di
 Hence Lakshmi went to the ocean
 vishnu ne lakshmi ke parityag kii vibhinn sthitiyon kaa varnan karke unhen sagar-manthan karne kaa aadesh diya
 Among the many gems that emerged from the churning, Lakshmi was also there
 lakshmi ne narayan ko varmala dekar prasann kiya
 Lakshmi gave the gods the boon of not deviating from Trilok anymore
 devataaon kaa raja indra kehalaata tha
 It is mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana that on the festival named Meghgiri, the gods anointed the green colored horse with Pakhasasana Indra to the post of king
 ramayana main bhi inhen varsha kaa devtaa mana gaya he
 As a result of Gautama's curse, he has also been called Ariesavrishan
 ramayana main inkaa chithran kathor shaasha, mahan yoddha, vishwavandy lokapal tathaa sahanubhutisheel devtaa ke saath-saath vilaasi, irshyaasheel evam shadyantri ke rup main bhi hua he
 Seeing Hung reached heaven, he dropped him upside down
 inhone ambarish ke yajna-pashu kaa apharan kar liya tha
 When Ambarish made Shunhasahep, the middle son of Ritchik, as a sacrifice animal, he was pleased with Shunshape's praise and saved him and made him live long
 inke prati aadar bhav tathaa sankat se bachaane kii bhaavana jan-saamaanya main barkaraar he
 Kausalya also calls upon Indra to protect Rama in the Van Yatra
 ramayana main inkaa shadyantri rup bhi dikhataa he
 In order to disturb the asceticism of a truthful and pious ascetic, he gave him his best pillar as a heritage
 vaidic indra bhaybheet nahin hote the
 In the Ramayana, Indra also shivered with fear of Ravana
 marutt ke yajna ke samay ravan ko upasthit dekhakar indra mor ban gayi the
 However his bravery has been unquestioned
 shachi se vivaah ke liye inhone shachi ke pita pulom tathaa chhalpurvak shachi ko harne vaale anuhlad ko bhi maar daalaa tha
 Seeing Devasena being annihilated at the time of Ravana's invasion of heaven, he confronted Ravana without any panic and turned him from war
 meghnad maaya ke bal se hi inhen bandi bana paaya tha
 Seeing the battle of rama-ravana, the god-gandhar-eunuchs said that this war is not the same because Ravana has a chariot and Rama is on foot
 at: indra ne apana rath ram ke liye bheja, jisamen indra kaa kavach, vishaal dhanush, baan tathaa shakti bhi the
 With folded hands, Matali asked Ramchandra to take the things of Rathadi and slay Ravana in the same way as the great Indra slay the demons
 yuddh-samaapti ke baad ram ne matli ko ajna di ki vah indra kaa rath aadi lautaakar le jaay
 In the context of Indra, some people make meaningless demonstration of their scholarship by giving arbitrary Vedic references to the mythology of Ahalya and arbitrary interpretation of it
 vaise log vaidic sandarbh ke naam par ahalya kaa arth 'bina hal chalaayi hui bhoomi' arth karte hai
 Essentially the first thing in this context is that the word 'ahalya' or 'ahilya' has not been used in the Rigveda
 rugveda hi nahin, anya vaidic samhitagranthon main bhi yah shabd nahin he
 It is only mentioned in the Brahmin texts
 shatapath brahman main indra ke liye 'ahalyaayai jaar' shabd kaa prayog hua he
 Apparently this experiment points to the same story which is described in the Valmiki Ramayana etc
 texts
 duusari baat yah ki rugveda main 'hal' shabd kaa bhi prayog nahin hua he
 The word 'longal' has been used in the Rigveda for the plow used in agriculture
 hal ke liye prayukt doosraa shabd he 'sira' anya samhita granthon tathaa brahmanon main bhi 'hal' kaa prayog nahin he
 In fact, the use of the plow may have started during the time of the Vedangas and it has been used more in secular Sanskrit
 aisi sthiti main ahalya kii purvokt vyakhya kam-se-kam vaidic sandarbhon se bhinn athwa dur avashya he
 The matter of symbolic interpretation is possible for many mythological stories and such efforts have been done
 parantu indra tathaa ahalya kii katha ko managasaint vaidic sansparsh dekar uske katharoop ko ram kaa ishwartv siddh karne ke liye ramakatha ke kaviyon kii kalpana maananaa vastav main ram tathaa ishwar ke prati apni tathyaheen ashraddha prakat karnaa hi he jo vastutah apni vyaktigat manyata kii baat he; kisi gyanakoshiya saamagree ke liye sarvatha anupyukt he
 The story of indra-ahalya episode is given in Valmiki Ramayana
 indra ne gautam kii dharmapatni ahalya kaa satitv apharan kiya tha
 The story goes like this - Shachipati Indra told Ahalya, knowing Gautama's absence from the ashram and wearing a monkey's costume
 
 17
 
 Hey very beautiful! Kamijans do not wait for the season for indulgence, that is, they do not believe that women should have intercourse only when they are retired from menstruation
 atah he sundar qamar vaali! main tumhaare saath samagam karnaa chahta hum
 
 18
 
 vishwamitra kehete hai ki he raghunandan! vah moorkha muniveshdhari indra ko pahchaan kar bhi is vichaar se ki 'swayan devraj indra mujhe chaahate hai', is prastaav se sahamat ho gayi
 
 19
 
 tadnantar vah santushtchitt hokar devataaon main shreshth indra se boli ki he surottam! main krutharth ho gayi
 Now you leave here soon
 
 20
 
 Then Indra also laughed and said, o beautiful buttress! i am completely satisfied
 ab jahaan se aayaa hum, vahaan chalaa jaaounga
 Thus after joining with Ahalya, he left the hut
 valmikiy ramayana main is prasang kaa kaaphi had tak maanviya rup main varnan he
 There is no mention of Ahalya being a stone or a river here
 shaap main bas yahi kaha gaya he ki vah lambe samay tak sabase chhipakar rahegi
 By drinking the wind, that is, one will be fasting and on the arrival of Rama, his hospitality will come in the former form
 shaap kii samaapti ke bare main bhi spasht likhaa he ki ram ke darshan se pehle usko dekh paanaa kisi ke liye kathin tha, ram ke darshan ho jane par vah sabko dikhaayi dene lagi
 It is quite clear from this that the idea of having a rock or river is much later than Valmiki Ramayana
 tridevon kii shreshthata sthapit hone tathaa indra kii mahatta nirantar kam hone ke kram main hi sara dosha indra par hi madh diya gaya or ahalya kaa charitra paavan mana gaya
 Some scholars have tried to give symbolic meaning to this story
 dharmik granthon main rahasywaadee shabdaawalee kaa prayog prachinkaal se prachlit he usapar vaidic shabdaawalee sone pe suhaaga kaa kaam karti thi at: uparokt kathan pratikatmak bhi ho saktaa he
 On analyzing, different meanings are revealed: - loukik sanskrit main ahalya kaa ek arth hota he " bina hal chali " yani banjar bhoomi
 As is known, Indra used to attack other countries, so as a result, the green land would become barren
 Indra, the source of this food or the source of the forest from which fruits, tubers and roots etc
 were destroyed and destroyed their enemies
 Used to deliver
 kalantar main vishwamitra ne ram se jab kaha ki ye ahalya he, to ho saktaa he unka taatpary ho ki ye "bina hal chali" yani banjar bhoomi he ise upjau banaao or ram ne us bhoomi ko phir se upjau banaaya ho
 The second context may be in reference to 'river' according to 'brahmapurana' and "anand Ramayana"
 apbhransh main 'sira ' shabd ke do arth hai ek to pathar or doosraa sukhi nadi
 As it has been analyzed as agriculture, it can also be that in reality there will be a river which goes to Indra's enemy country and its main source of water must have been dried by Indra so that the enemy country cannot get water
 And later Rama would have made it watery
 is prakaar dekhen to ahalya-prasang prakruti kaa maanvikaran maatr he
 The mythological form of Indra is found in Mahabharata
 yahaan unka vaidic-sahitya main varnit gaurav nahin rah gaya he
 They are specifically referred to as 'shakra'
 apana devraj pad kho jane kaa bhay inhen baraabar sataaya karata he or isse bachane ke liye ye uchit-anuchit praytn karte rahete hai
 Fearful of Vishwamitra's tenacity, Apsara named Maneka sent her to dissolve his penance
 sharadvat ke tap se bhaybheet hokar jaanapadi naamak apsara ko unka tap bhang karne bheja
 Fearing the heat of Yavakrit, Indra assumed the form of a Brahmin and meditated with him
 valmikiy ramayana main varnit ahalya-prasang kaa ullekh mahabharat main bhi miltaa he
 Here he is considered a rapist
 rugveda main ullikhit indra ke 'harishmashru' hone kaa kathatmak samarthan mahabharat main bhi miltaa he
 It has been said here that Indra had to suffer due to the curse of Gautama
 ye hi arjuna ke pita the
 In fear of Vritrasura, all the gods had dedicated their powers to them
 isliye arjuna ko unase hi divyastra praapt karne ke liye kaha gaya
 Many stories related to these are given in Mahabharata
 indra vastutah ek pad kaa naam he
 The term of king of gods is called 'indra'
 us pad par baithne vaale vyakti kaa naam bhi indra ho jaataa he
 Its signs are found in many mythology and descriptions, but it is well-known from many references of Mahabharata that it is the name of a verse
 jin-jin kathaon main ye pad chhin jane se bhaybheet hote hai un kathaon ke saath indra banane kii anya vyaktiyon kii kathaon ko milakar dekhne par baat bilkul spasht ho jaati he
 In many places, the term 'indra' has been used instead of the person's use
 kuch sandarbh drashtavy hai :- Shiva fainted Indra and put him in a cave along with the other four Indras of the past
 indrapad kii abhilaashaa rakhane vaale nirkasur kaa vishnu ne vadh kiya
 The sages, gods led by Shakra, asked Skanda to become the 'indra' of the gods
 brahmahatya se grast ho jane par shakr ke indra-pad chhod dene par nahush 'indra' bane
 After the fall of Nahusha, Shakra regained Indra-post by performing the ritual of Ashwamedha Yajna as per Vishnu's orders
 inke sivaa bhi indra-pad ke anek spasht ullekh mahabharat main uplabdh hai
 In the first and second chapters of the third part in Srivishnupurana and in the first and triodas chapter of the eighth wing of the Bhagavata Mahapuran, different names of the 14 manvantaras are given
 mahakavi swayambhu virachit 'paum chariu' mahakavy kii atiumo sandhi main ek aise vyakti kii katha di gayi he jisane devraj indra se prabhavit hokar apane naam ke saath sab kuch indravat karnaa chaha tha
 Manas Sundari was the name of Sunitambini Peenpayodhara wife of Vidyadhar king Sahasrar of Rathnupur city
 surashri se use jo putr hua, uskaa naam indra rakhaa gaya
 When Indra became king, he named the minister from the assistant students, named Jupiter, Elephant Airavat, similarly Pawan, Kubera, Varuna, Yama and Chandra and named Urvashi, Rambha, Tilottama etc
 after their singers and declared that whatever signs of Indra
 They are mine too
 main prithvi mandal kaa indra hoon
 Listening to his prosperity, the ruler of Lanka attacked the demon Mali with his brother Sumali and a large army
 ghamaasan yuddh ke pashchaat rakshasraj maaraa gaya tathaa sumali pataal lanka main pravesh kar gaya

 Its main theme is Bhakti Yoga, in which Krishna is depicted as the God of all the Gods or God Himself

 Traditionally, the author of this Purana is considered Veda Vyasa

 In calculating the Puranas, the Bhagavata is counted as the Ashtam Purana

 Nowadays, two Puranas bearing the 'bhagwat' legend are available: at: in donon main puraana koti main kiski gananaa apekshit he ? is prashn kaa samaadhaan aavashyak he
 Finally, after reviewing it in various ways, it seems that Shrimad Bhagwat should be considered as Puran and it is appropriate to keep Devi Bhagwat in the category of Uppurana
 shrimadbhagwat devibhagwat ke swarupanirdesh ke vishay main maun he
 But Devi Bhagwat counts 'bhagavata' under the subpuras and itself under the Puranas
 devibhagapancham skandh main varnit bhuvankosh shrimadbhagwat ke pancham skandh main prastut is vishay kaa aksharsh: anukaran karata he
 In Shree Bhagwat, the eight verses representing the glory of Bharatvarsha are quoted literally in the Bhagwat in the same order
 donon ke varnanon main antar itnaa hi he ki shrimadbhagwat jahaan vaigyanik vishay ke vivaran ke nimitt gadhy kaa naiysargik madhyam pakadta he, vahaan vishistataa ke pradarshanath devibhagwat padya ke kritrim madhyam kaa prayog karata he

 The Bhagwat himself states- 'vidyavataan bhagavate pariksha' : bhagwat vidvatta kii kasuti he or isi kaaran tikasampatti kii drushti se bhi yah athulaneey he
 Scholars of various Vaishnava sects have advocated self-explanatory interpretations on Bhagavat for the subsistence and affirmation of their specific doctrine, in which some commentators are briefly mentioned here: bhagwat ke deshkal kaa yatharth nirnay abhi tak nahin ho paaya he
 In the eleventh wing, people drinking water from Dravidian rivers like Kaveri, Tamraparni, Kritamala, etc
 have been shown as devotees of Lord Vasudeva

 It is certain that Hemadri, eminent theologian and minister of Bopdev, Mahadev and King Ramachandra, in his 'chaturvarga Chintamani' has quoted many of Bhagwat's words, cannot be considered the author of Bhagwat

 With this, the creation of Bhagwat cannot be considered archaic by the seventh century
 nimnlikhit talika main kuch vidwaanon dwaara sujhaayaa gaya bhagwat puraana kaa rachanakaal diya gaya he- The influence of Bhagwat was very active in the rise of medieval Vaishnava sects and was particularly important in the rise of Krishna poems of the provincial languages of India

 Inspired by the narration, Radhakrishna has sung a beautiful keli in his various poems
 tamil, andhra, kannada tathaa malayalam ke vaishnav kaviyon ke upar bhi bhagwat kaa prabhaav bhi kam nahin he
 Bhagwat's spiritual outlook is of monotheism and devotion is devotional
 is prakaar advait ke saath bhakthi kaa samrasya bhagwat kii apni vishistataa he
 For these reasons, Bhagwat is considered to be the undercurrent of Kavyatrayi of Sanskrit along with Valmiki Ramayana and Mahabharata

 The leelavataras of Vishnu are described in its Sukumar language in its various wings

 maanas athwa manas kaa sandarbh nimna se ho saktaa hai: Acharya Vinoba Bhave was a freedom fighter fighter, social worker and famous Gandhian leader of India
 unka mul naam vinayak narhari bhaave tha
 He is considered the national teacher of India and the spiritual successor of Mahatma Gandhi
 unhone apane jivan ke aakhri varsh ponar, maharashtra ke ashram main gujaarey
 He started the Bhoodan movement
 indira gandhi dwaara ghoshit apatkaal ko 'anushaasan parv' kehane ke kaaran ve vivaad main bhi the
 Vinoba Bhave's original name was Vinayak Narhari Bhave
 maharashtra ke konkan kshetra main ek gaanv he, gagoda
 yahaan ke chitapaavan brahman the, narhari bhaave
 ganit ke premi or vaigyanik sooyeeboojh vaale
 rasayan vigyaan main unki ruchi thi
 In those days colors had to be imported from outside
 narhari bhaave raat-din rangon kii khoj main lage rahete
 bas ek dhun thi unki ki bharat ko is maamle main aatmanirbhar banaaya ja sake
 His mother Rukmini Bai was a female student
 udaar-chitt, aathon yam bhakthi-bhav main dubi rahati
 iskaa asar unke dainik kaary par bhi padataa tha
 Had the mind gone somewhere else, sometimes the salt would have reduced in the vegetable, sometimes more
 Sometimes forget to add asafoetida to the lentils, and sometimes the lentils are served without the pot
 The whole house was filled with devotional juice
 isliye in choti-moti baton kii ore kisi kaa dhyaan hi nahin jaataa tha
 Vinoba was born on 11 September 1895 in the same Satvik environment
 unka bachapan kaa naam tha vinayak
 maa unhen pyaar se vinya kahkar bulaatin
 vinoba ke alaava rukmini bai ke do or bete the: valcoba or shivaji
 vinayak se chote valcoba
 shivaji sabase chote
 vinoba naam gandhi ji ne diya tha
 According to the practice of putting 'ba' behind the name in Maharashtra
 Tukoba, Vithoba and Vinoba
 maa kaa swabhaav vinayak ne bhi paaya tha
 His mind is always absorbed in spiritual thinking
 He was not able to eat or drink
 na swaad kii khaas pahchaan thim
 Served like a mother, she would eat quietly
 Rukmini Bai's throat was very sweet
 bhajan sunate hue ve usamen dub jaatin
 gaatin to bhav-vibhor hokar, puure vaataavaran main bhakthi-salila pravaahit hone lagati
 ramayana kii chapaaiyaan ve madhur bhav se gaatin
 aisa lagata jaise maa sharada gunaguna rahi ho
 His mother Rukmini Bai was instrumental in giving Vinoba the rites of spirituality, leading her towards bhakti-vedanta, inspiring her to renounce and recluse in her childhood
 balak vinayak ko mata-pita donon ke sanskaar mili
 He received from his father the art of thinking and reasoning in mathematics, deep affection for science, scientific approach to tradition and the art of thinking away from all kinds of prejudices
 jabaki maa kii ore se mili dharm or samskruti ke prati gahan anuraag, pranimaatr ke kalyaan kii bhaavana
 jivan ke prati sakaaratmak drushtikon, sarvadharm sambhaav, sashastitv or sasamman kii kala
 aage chalakar vinoba ko gandhi ji kaa aadhyatmik uttaradhikari mana gaya
 Even today some people say this
 magar yah vinoba ke charitra kaa ekangi or ekatarfa vishleshan he
 He was the master of independent thinking, far ahead of Gandhi's 'spiritual successor'
 mukhya baat yah he ki gandhi ji ke prakhar prabhamandal ke aage unke vyaktitv kaa swatantra moolyankan ho hi nahin paaya
 Mahatma Gandhi was a political animal
 unki aadhyatmik chetana subah-shaam kii aarti or puja-paath tak simit thi
 Whereas his religious-consciousness was favorable and coordinative of his political programs
 usamen aalochana-samiksha bhav ke liye koi sthaan nahin tha
 In the matter of religion, even Vinoba had dedication and acceptance
 magar unhen jab bhi avasar mila dharm-granthon kii vyakhya unhone li se hatakar kii
 Whether it is 'gita discourse' or 'santprasad', a book written on the abuses of Sant Tukaram This gives it enough originality and ease
 yah kaary vahi kar saktaa tha jo kisi ke bhi bauddhik prabhamandal se mukt ho
 One thing is that even before Mahatma Gandhi entered into peace, Vinoba had attained spiritual height
 ashram main aanane ke baad bhi ve adhyayan-chintan ke liye niyamit samay nikaalte the
 On being impressed in his first meeting with Vinoba, Gandhi ji had said instinctively- darshanashastra unka priy vishay tha
 Within a few months of admission to the ashram, he took a year of study leave for further study of philosophy
 vinoba ke yun to do chote bhai or bhi the, magar maa kaa sarvaadhik vatsalya vinayak ko hi mila
 On an emotional level, Vinoba also found himself closer to his mother than his father
 yahi haal rukmini bai kaa tha, teenon beton main ‘vinya’ unke dil ke sarvaadhik kareeb tha
 She remained devoted to bhajan-pujan
 Effect of mother's rites
 The feeling of indifference and renunciation towards material comforts had become a part of Vinoba's character in his teens
 ghar kaa nirjan konaa unhen zyada sukun detaa
 maun unke antarman ko mukhar bana detaa
 ve ghar main rahete, parivaar main sabake bich, magar aise ki sabake saath rahete hue bhi jaise unase alag, nisprih or nirpeksh hon
 nahin to maa ke paas, unke sanndhyi main
 ‘vinya’ unke dil, unki aadhyatmik man-rachana ke adhik kareeb tha
 If there is any confusion in the mind, then it helps in solving
 Even if there is a spiritual problem, the Vinaya only works
 Even if husband Narhari Bhave also says something, the decision of Vinaya was important in that
 aisa nahin he ki vinya ekadam mukt yaa niyantran se pare tha
 The family code of conduct was also fully applicable to Vinoba
 balki vinoba ke bachapan kii ek ghatana he
 Rukmini Bai had made a rule for children that food will be available only after giving water to basil plant
 Vinya reaches home after playing outside, distraught with hunger
 On reaching mother, she would say: rukmini sone se pehle samarth guru ramdaas kii pustak ‘das bodh’ kaa pratidin adhyayan karatin
 uske baad hi ve charpai par jaatin
 balak vinya par is asar padana swaabhaavik hi tha
 They would tell him stories of saints Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, Namdev and Shankaracharya
 The stories of Ramayana, Mahabharata, explain the element knowledge of Upanishads
 Sannyas used to ride on his feelings
 But instead of running away from the world, she insisted on connecting with people
 Instead of running away from the world, she would ask for change
 Often she says, 'vinya, following the house of labor well, the fathers get freedom
 ’ lekin vinya par to guru ramdaas, sant gyaneshwar or shankaracharya kaa bhoot savaar rahata
 in sabhi mahatmaon ne apni aadhyatmik tripti ke liye bahut kam aayu main apane mata-pita or ghar-parivaar kaa bahishkaar kiya tha
 They say- aise main koi or maa hoti to hill jaati
 vichaarmaatr se ro-rokar aasmaan sir par uthaa leti
 kyonki logon kii saamaanya-si pravriti ban chuki he ki tyaagi, vairaagi hona acchhee baat, mahanata kii baat, magar tabhi tak jab tyaagi or vairaagi duusare ke ghar main hon
 apane ghar main sab saadhaaran sansaarik jivan jeena chaahate hai
 But Rukmini Bai was like any other clay
 ve bade pyaar se bete ko samajhaatin— The son was trying to assimilate the mother's words that she would add further bachapan main bahut kushagra buddhi the vinoba
 ganit unka priy vishay tha
 The rites of poetry and spiritual consciousness met the mother
 unheen se jad or chetan donon ko samaan drushti se dekhne kaa bodh jaagaa
 maa bahut kam padhi-likhi thim
 But he told Vinya of his conduct about Aparigraha, Astaya
 sansar main rahete hue bhi usase nisprih-nirlypt rahanaa sikhaaya
 maa kaa hi asar tha ki vinya kavita rachate or or unhen aag ke hawaale kar dete
 duniya main jab sab kuch asthai or kshanbhangur he, kuch bhi saath nahin janaa to apni rachana se hi moh kyon paala jaae
 unki maa yah sab dekhti, sochatin, magar kuch na kahatee
 maano vinya ko bade se bade tyaag ke liye taiyaar kar rahi hon
 vinoba kii ganit kii praveenta or uske tark unke aadhyatmik vishwaas ke aade nahin aate the
 Even if there was competition between the two, the victory would be of spiritual faith
 Today those events are a historical document of mutual affection and affection of mother and son
 rukmini bai har maheene chaaval ke ek lakh dane daan karti thim
 It was not easy to count one lakh, so she would keep counting every single rice for the whole month
 Narahari Bhave smiled to see his wife laboring in counting rice
 At an early age, the eye would become afraid of weakness
 His math intelligence would have said something else
 So one day he interrupted Rukmini Bai - 'what is the need to spend time counting each and every rice like this? ek pav chaaval lo
 unki ginati kar lo
 phir usee se ek lakh chawlon kaa vajan nikaalkar taul lo
 kami na rahe, isliye ekaadh mutthi upar se daal lo
’ baat tark kii thi
 Cosmic prudence was also in it that whenever possible, time should be saved for other important tasks
 Rukmini Bai would have understood the logic of her husband
 But the mind does not agree One day after he revealed his dilemma to Vinya, he asked- bete ne sabakuch suna, sochaa
 Said, 'mother, father has reason to argue
 ganit yahi kahata he
 But counting rice for charity is not just counting
 ginati karte samay har chaaval ke saath ham na keval ishwar kaa naam lete jate hai, balki hamaara man bhi usee se judaa rahata he
 'counting rice for charity in the name of God is also a practice, where did Rukmini Bai first think
 aadhyatmaras main puri tarah dubi rahane vaali rukmini bai ko ‘vinya’ kii baaten khub bhaatin
 bete par garv ho aata tha unhen
 unhone aage bhi chawlon kii ginati karnaa na choda
 na hi is kaam se unke man kabhi nirarthakta bodh jaagaa
 This is another incident
 jo darshaati he ki vinoba kori ganitiya gananaaon main aadhyatmik tatv kaise khoj lete the
 The incident is about the time when he entered Gandhiji's ashram and was actively participating in his creative works
 ashram main subah-shaam prarthana sabhaayen hotin
 unamem upasthit hone vaale ashramavaasiyon kii niyamit ginati kii jaati
 yah jimmedaari ek kaaryakarta thi
 The incident is that one day after the prayer meeting, when that worker told the number of visitors who were present in the prayer, Vinoba quickly reacted saying - kaaryakarta ko apni ginati par vishwaas tha, isliye vah bhi apni baat par ad gaya
 Vinoba, who believed in karma, generally avoided getting into arguments
 magar us din ve bhi apni baat par ad gaye
 Disputes in the ashram were settled in Bapu's court
 gandhi ji ko apane kaaryakarta par vishwaas tha
 But knew that Vinoba was not going to get into arguments like this
 He looked at Vinoba to know the reality
 Then Vinoba said - 'the number of devotees involved in the prayer was less than what they told
 ’ ‘vah kaise?’ ‘isliye ki ek aadmi kaa to puraa dhyaan vahaan upasthit sajjanon kii ginati karne main laga tha
 Gandhiji understood Vinoba's logic
 prarthana ke kaam main hisaab-kitaab or dikhaave kii jarurat hi kya
 aage se prarthana sabha main aae logon kii ginati kaa kaam roak diya gaya
 Vinoba Aanjan was determined to remain celibate in the early stages of puberty
 vahi mahapurush unke adarsh the jinhone satya kii khoj ke liye bachapan main hi vairaygy odh liya tha
 And when you have to become celibate by taking renunciation, if you want to break away from home life, why not prepare your mind accordingly
 Why be entangled in the sweet cords of relationships, worldly temptations
 The first condition of celibacy is to prevent the mind from wandering
 Control over lusts
 kishor vinayak se kisi ne kah diya tha ki brahmacharee ko kisi vivaah ke bhoj main sammilit nahin hona chahie
 He often avoided going to such programs
 pita narhari bhaave to the hi, yadi kisi or ko hi janaa hua to chote bhai chale jate
 vinoba kaa tan durbal tha
 There was some disease since childhood
 But mind-mind is fully conscious
 It is as if all the powers of the body were confined into the mind
 The memory was unique
 kishor vinayak ne veda, upanishad ke saath-saath sant gyaneshwar, tukaraam, namdev ke saikadon pad acchhee tarah yaad kar liye the
 Geeta had memorized him since childhood
 aage chalakar chalis hajaar shloke bhi unke maanas main acchhee tarah ram gaye
 When Vinayak's elder sister's marriage was fixed, it was as if the hour of examination also came closer
 unhone tay kar liya ki vivaah ke avasar par bhoj se dur rahenge
 koi tokaa-taaki na kare, isliye unhone us din upwas rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 In the sister's marriage, the brother fasted, this was also not appropriate
 pita to sunate hi naaraaz ho gaye
 But the mother handled the matter
 unhone bete ko saadhaaran ‘daal-bhaat’ khaane ke liye raji kar liya
 Not only this, he cooked it with his own hands and gave it too
 dhooma-dham se vivaah hua
 Vinayak happily participated in it
 lekin apane liye maa dwaara khaas taur par banaae daal-bhaat se hi guzaara kiya
 This love of mother and son continued even further
 aage chalakar jab sanyas ke liye ghar choda to maa kii ek laal kinari vaali dhoti or unke puujaghar se ek muti saath le gaye
 He had presented the idol to another
 magar maa kii dhoti jahaan bhi ve jate, apane saath rakhte
 sote to sirahaane rakhkar
 jaise maa kaa aashirwad saath liye phirte hon
 sanyasi man bhi maa kii smritiyon se peechha nahin chhuta paaya tha
 The rites of mother became the foundation of Vinoba's spiritual consciousness
 unheen par unka jeevandarshan viksit hua
 Later on, the fame he earned in the field of creativity and spirituality was also the inspiration of his mother
 rukmini bai kam padhi-likhin thim
 Did not understand Sanskrit
 lekin man tha ki gita-gyaan ke liye tarasata rahata
 ek din maa ne apni kathinaayee putr ke samaksh rakh hi di— Vinoba was opposed to hypocrisy in religious rites
 maa ke nidhan ke samay bhi vinoba kaa apane pita or bhaaiyon se matbhed hua
 Vinoba was opposed to cremation in the traditional manner with the hands of the Brahmins
 lekin parivaar waalon kii jid ke aage unki ek na chali
 vinoba bhi apane siddhanton par adig the
 As a result, the mother whom he wanted most, who was his spiritual master, stayed away from his funeral
 maa ko unhone bhigi ankhon se maun vidaai di
 Later on 29 October 1947, when Vinoba's father died, he insisted on pressing the soil, instead of dedicating his body to fire, following the instructions of the Vedas that 'the soil has the right to the soil'
 tab tak vinoba sant vinoba ho chuke the
 He was blessed by Gandhiji
 isliye is baar unheen kii chali
 Mother had faith in Gita
 ve vinoba ko gita kaa marathi main anuwaad karne kaa daayitv saunpkar gai thim
 Vinoba was busy in that task
 aakhir anuwaad karm puraa hua
 The book was named - Geetai
 Geeta + i = Geetai
 In Maharashtra, 'I' means 'towards mother'; That is, the memory of the mother is associated with her nehru-gita
 Rukmini Bai was not alive to see the son's work
 magar unki yaad or abhilaashaa se judi gitai, maharashtra ke ghar-ghar main maataaon or bahanon ke kanth-swar main dhalane lagi
 His spirituality became the jewel of consciousness
 gandhi ji ne suna to anuwaad karm kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii
 For women who did not know Sanskrit, who had even half-incomplete knowledge of their language, 'geetai', composed in simple language, became a boon to drown in the spirituality of the Gita
 vinoba ko bachapan main maa se mili sanskaar yuvavastha main or bhi gadhe hote chale gaye
 Moving towards youth, Vinoba had neither forgotten Saint Dnyaneshwar nor Tukaram
 vahi unke adarsh the
 He used to sing with great enthusiasm in Saint Tukaram
 He liked to fight, quarrel with his adorable, abusive and angry, he liked very much
 The life of Saint Ramdas also inspired him
 He was neither able to forget Shankaracharya nor his retirement
 darshan unka priy vishay tha
 Ever since the Himalayas were conscious, they used to come in their dreams and they would find themselves meditating in deep tantras in search of truth
 The uninhabited there, in the long, deep cauldrons covered with worms, would incite them to become absorbed in the pursuit of supreme truth
 1915 main unhone hai skool kii pariksha paas kii
 Now what to read next The ideological duality of the father of scientific temper and mother steeped in spirituality also appeared in different streams there
 pita ne kahaμ‘french padho
’ maa boleen—‘brahman kaa betaa sanskrit na padhe, yah kaise sambhav he!’ vinoba ne un donon kaa man rakhaa
 Chose French at Inter
 sanskrit kaa adhyayan unhone nijee str par jari rakhaa
 In those days, French was the language of revolution in the field of knowledge science
 sara parivartankami sahitya usamen rachaa ja rahaa tha
 Baroda's library, on the other hand, was famous throughout the country for treasures of rare books, manuscripts
 vinoba ne us pustkaalay ko apana doosraa thikaana bana diya
 As soon as he was discharged from school, he would go to the library and drown in studies
 French literature introduced Vinoba to the ideological revolution happening in western countries
 Knowledge of Sanskrit enabled him to penetrate deeply into the Vedas and Upanishads
 gyaan kaa str badha, to uski lalak bhi badi
 magar man se himalay kaa aakarshan, sanyas kii saadh, vairagyabodh na gaya
 In those days, had to go to Mumbai for the Inter examination
 vinoba bhi tay kaarykram ke anusaar 25 march 1916 ko mumbai jane vaali railgadee main savaar hue
 us samay unka man dawandol tha
 i was confident that i would pass the Inter exam just like high school
 But what after that? Is this the goal of his life? Vinoba felt that what he wanted in his life was not possible through formal study
 vidhyalay ke praaanpatr or kaliz kii digriyaan unka abhishth nahin hai
 The train was running at its own pace
 usase sahasr guna tej bhaag rahaa tha vinoba kaa man
 aakhir jeet man kii hui
 As soon as the car reached Surat, Vinoba came down from it
 gaadi aage badi par vinoba kaa man duusari ore khinchataa chalaa gaya
 On the second platform, there was an eastbound train
 vinoba ko laga ki himalay ek baar phir unhen aamantrit kar rahaa he
 Household life or retirement
 There was a struggle in the mind for some time
 He made the decision while going through the turbulence and boarded the same car
 sanyasi apni pasandida yatra par nikal padaa
 is hakeekat se anjaan ki is baar bhi jis yatra ke liye ve thaan kar nikle hai, vah unki asli yatra nahin, sirf ek padaav he
 Escape from life is not their destiny
 unhen to lakhon-karodon bharatiyon ke jivan kii saadh, unke liye ek ummid banakar ubharna he
 Vinoba was wandering in search of Brahm, the search for truth, the practice of renunciation
 usee lakshya ke saath unhone ghar choda tha
 The journey towards the Himalayas was on
 bich main kaashi kaa padaav aayaa
 According to myths, the city of Lord Shankar
 Kashi has been the center of religious philosophy for thousands of years
 Aquarius of sages and thinkers
 a holy pilgrimage center attracting curious and knowledge-oriented people
 Even Shankaracharya could not stop himself from the temptation of traveling to Kashi
 kaashi ke ganga ghat par jahaan nae vichaar panape to vitanda bhi anginat rache jate rahe
 Vinoba was wandering on the same Ganges coast
 apane liye manzil kii talash main
 guru kii talash main jo unhen aage kaa rasta dikhaa sake
 The path to reach the goal for which he had left home
 bhatakate hue ve ek sthaan par pahunche jahaan kuch satya-sadhak shastrarth kar rahe the
 The subject was who was right in advaita and dvaita
 The question was quite old
 lagbhag baarah sau varsh pehle bhi is par nirnaayak bahes ho chuki thi
 Between Shankaracharya and Mandan Mishra
 In that historical debate, the dualist Mandan Mishra and his wife were defeated by Shankaracharya
 vahi vishay phir un satya-saadhakon ke bich aa fansaa tha
 Or say that the two sides were creating their own arguments with their arguments to cut the time
 or phir bahes ko samaapan kii ore le jate hue achaanak ghoshnaa kar di gai ki advaitavaadi kii jeet hui he
 Vinoba Chanke
 He lost his laugh- ek ore vinoba sanyas kii saadh main, satyanveshan kii lalak liye kaashi kii galiyon main, ghaaton par bhatak rahe the
 On the other hand, another curious was set out to visit India, to know India, to recognize the beats of his heartland, to establish an intimate relationship with him
 vah kuch hi maheene pehle dakshin africa se beshumaar khyaati batorkar lautaa tha
 Further, it was planned to interfere in Indian politics
 us sadhak kaa naam tha—mohandas karamchand gandhi
 apane raajnneetik guru govind ballab pant ke kehane par vah bharat kii aatma ko jaanane ke uddeshy se ek varsh ke bharat-bhraman par niklaa hua tha
 Gandhi, who later became the non-violent fighter, became the main architect of the Indian independence movement, the heartbeat of crores of Indians, dominated the Indian politics in those days
 ‘mahatma’ kii oopaadhi bhi unase dur thi
 Only the capital of the agitation launched in South Africa was with him
 usee ke kaaran ve puure bharat main jane jate the
 In those days his stop was also Kashi
 maano do mahaan atmaaon ko milwane ke liye samay apana jaadui khel rach rahaa tha
 In Kashi, a huge procession was taking place in the Hindu University established by Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya
 4 farvari 1916, jalse main raaje-maharaaje, nabaav, samant sab apni puri dhaj ke saath upasthit the
 It was made on seeing the tone of the conference
 us sammelan main gandhi ji ne aitihaasik bhaashan diya
 He said what no one could expect at that time
 vakt padane par jin raja-saamanton kii khushaamad swayan angrej bhi karte the, jinke daan par kaashi vishvavidhyalay or duusari anya sansthaaen chalaa karti thim, un raja-saamanton kii khuli aalochana karte hue gandhi ji ne kaha ki apane dhan kaa sadupyog rashtranirmaan ke liye karen
 Apply it for the welfare of the poor
 He asked them to donate all their jewelery to the wider public interest
 vah ek krantikari apil thi
 There was a panic in the meeting
 par gandhi kii muskaan usee tarah bani rahi
 The next day the newspapers were dyed with the news of that conference
 vinoba ne samachaarpatr ke madhyam se hi gandhi ji ke bare main janaa
 or unhen laga ki jis lakshya kii khoj main ve ghar se nikle hai, vah puri hui
 Vinoba Corey did not leave home in search of peace
 na ve desh ke halaat or angrejon dwaara kiye ja rahe amanviya atyaacharon se aparichit the
 But there was no way out
 bhaashan padhakar unhen laga ki is vyakti ke paas shanti bhi he or kranti bhi
 unhone vahiin se gandhi ji ke naam patr likhaa
 jawaab aayaa
 With Gandhiji's invitation
 Vinoba was waiting for him
 ve turant ahmedabad sthit cocharb ashram kii ore prasthaan kar gaye, jahaan gandhi ji kaa ashram tha
 On 7 June 1916 Vinoba met Gandhi for the first time
 uske baad to vinoba gandhi ji ke hi hokar rah gaye
 Gandhiji also recognized Vinoba's talent
 isliye pehali mulaakaat ke baad hi unki tippanee thi ki adhikansh log yahaan se kuch lene ke liye aate hai, yah pehla vyakti he, jo kuch dene ke liye aayaa he
 Recalling his first meeting after a long time, Vinoba said- gandhi or vinoba kii vah mulaakaat krantikari thi
 As soon as Gandhiji came to know that Vinoba had come without telling his parents, he wrote a letter to Vinoba's father from there that Vinoba was safe with him
 uske baad unke sambandh lagaataar pragadh hote chale gaye
 Vinoba devoted himself to Gandhiji's ashram
 adhyayan, adhyaapan, katai, kheti ke kaam se lekar saamudayik jivan tak ashram kii har gatividhi main ve aage rahete
 gandhi ji kaa yah kahana ki yah yuvak ashramavaasiyon se kuch lene nahin balki dene aayaa he, satya hota ja rahaa tha
 Vinoba, who was very young from his age, was teaching him a lesson of discipline and dutifulness
 gandhi ji kaa prabhaav teji se bad rahaa tha
 The number of workers coming to the ashram is increasing equally fast
 The Kocharb ashram started getting smaller, and the work of new ashram on the banks of Sabarmati in Ahmedabad started happening fast
 But the work of preparing non-violent soldiers of independence was not possible even from the Sabarmati Ashram alone
 gandhi vaisaa hi ashram wardha main bhi chaahate the
 There was a need for such a disciplined worker who could run the ashram in accordance with Gandhiji's ideals
 For this, Vinoba was the most suitable character and reliable of Gandhiji
 Vinoba departed for Wardha on 8 April 1923
 vahaan unhone ‘maharashtra dharm’ masik kaa sampadan shuru kiya
 In this magazine to be published in Marathi, Vinoba started writing regularly on the Upanishads and the saints of Maharashtra, which led to the beginning of the Bhakti movement in the country
 patrika ko apratyaashit lokapriyata praapt hui, kuch hi samay pashchaat usko saptahik kar dena padaa vinoba abhi tak gandhi ji ke shishy or satyagrahi ke rup main jane jate the
 Through the magazine, the public was getting to know their spiritual penetration

 Before starting his Satyagraha, Vinoba issued a statement clarifying his views
 usamen kaha gaya tha- He further said so much - apane bhaashanon main vinoba logon ko bataate the ki nakaaratmak kaaryakramon ke jariye na to shaanti sthapit ho sakati he or na yuddh samaapt ho saktaa he

mashruwala's book Gandhi and Marx was published and Vinoba wrote the role
 isamen vinoba ne marks ke prati kaaphi sammaan pradarshit kiya tha
 He considered Karl Marx a thinker
 aisa vichaarak jiske man main garibon ke prati sachhee sahanubhuti thi
 By the way, Vinoba was found to be wrong in Marx's thinking and expressed his differences with Marx on how to reach the goal
 vinoba kaa maananaa tha ki dhani logon kii vajah se communiston kaa udbhav hua he
 Vinoba believed that the principle of equality should be applied in everything
 unhone kaha tha : communiston kaa aatank dur karne ke liye police karrwai madadgaar sabit nahin ho sakati
 It should be eliminated from the root
 chaahe jitne bhi digbhramit ve kyon na ho, vinoba communiston ko vidhvansak nahin maanate the or unase tarkvitark karke tathaa unke lakshya ke prati sakriy sahanubhuti prakat karke vinoba unhen sahi raste par laana chaahate the
 Vinoba ji, a scholar of twenty languages, wanted to see Devanagari as a world script
 bharat ke liye ve devanagari ko sampark lipi ke rup main viksit karne ke pakshdhar the
 They used to say that i do not say that Nagari should only go, but i want Nagari also to go

 He actively contributed to Gandhian's creative works before independence
 kaarydhiky se unka swasthya girane laga, unhen kisi pahari sthaan par jane kii doctor ne salaah di
 So in 1937, Vinoba Bhave went to the Pawanar Ashram
 tab se lekar jivan paryant unke rachanaatmak kaaryon ko prarambh karne kaa yahi kendriya sthaan rahaa
 He was also a great freedom fighter in addition to creative works
 nagpur jhanda satyagrah main ve bandi banaaye gayi
 In 1937, when Gandhiji surrendered empty handed from the London Round Table Conference, Vinoba Bhave criticized the British at a gathering in Jalgaon, and was sentenced to six months in prison
 karagaar se mukt hone ke baad gandhiji ne unhen pahela satyagrahi banaaya
 Vinoba Bhaveji performed the Satyagraha on 17 October 1940 and he was imprisoned and was punished for 3 years rigorous imprisonment
 gandhiji ne 1942 ko bharat chhoda andolan karne se purv vinobaaji se paraamarsh liya tha

 It provides software interfaces for hardware devices, and allows the operating system to access and control its functions without any hardware knowledge
 jab computer main koi nayaa upkaran joda jaataa he, jaise printer, scinar, aadi to usee main unka driver bhi hota he
 In some computers the driver is already installed, then in some we have to install it later

 Scuba diving is done purely for recreational enjoyment
 gotakhoron ko pani ke neeche kaary karne ke liye peshewar tareeke se niojit kiya ja saktaa he
 The depth range for scuba diving depends on self-adjustment and training, but the dives that are used for recreation are 30 meters deep or less
 manranjan ke liye kiye jane vaale gotakhori main gotaakhor aadhi muh ke mask kaa istemaal karte he jo unke naak or muh ko dhaktaa hai
 Professional scuba divers use full face masks
 kuch diving ke liye gaison kaa mishran prayog main laayaa jaataa hai jo saamaanya vayumandaleey hawa ke alaava hota he jab tak gotaakhor iske prayog main sakasham hai
 In order to dive safely, divers need to control their landing and landing rate, for this they are required to maintain a uniform depth in the water
 gotakhoron lagaataar gaharaai main rahane ke liye chaahate hai, ve tatasth oochaal hasil karne ke liye prayaas karen
 Water has a higher refractive index than air, which is substantially similar to the cornea of the eye

 In physics many systems have such a tendency that they oscillate with very high amplitude at certain frequencies
 is sthiti ko anunaad kehete hai
 The frequency at which the tendency to oscillate with the highest amplitude is found, that frequency is called the resonance frequency
 sabhi prakaar ke compano yaa tarangon ke saath anunaad kii ghatana judi hui he
 That is, resonance can occur with mechanical, sound, electromagnetic or quantum wave functions
 koi chote aayam kaa bhi aavarti bal, jo anunaad aavriti vaala yaa uske lagbhag baraabar aavriti vaala ho, us tantra main bahut adhik aayam ke dolan paidaa kar saktaa he
 Resonant systems have many uses
 inkaa upyog kisi vaanchit aavriti par kampan paidaa karne ke liya kiya ja saktaa he; athwa kisi jatil kampan main se kisi chuni hui aavriti ko chhaatane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 1) an object or system - which has a natural frequency; 2) a carrier or causal force - whose frequency is the same as the natural frequency of the system; 3) In this system, the energy-destroying component should be minimum
 , shyanta aadi kisi tantra main urja hraas ke liye jimmedaar hote hai
 ) dhwani se sambandhit anuprayogon main, kisi vastu kii anunaad aavriti us vastu kii prakritik aavruti ke baraabar hoti he
 It is important that the natural frequency of an object is determined by the value of the physical components of that object
 bhautik avyavon se prakritik aavriti ke nirdhaaran kaa yah tathy bhautikee ke sabhi kshetron main lagu hota he
 Some of the implications of resonant frequency are as follows: 1) kisi vastu ko uske prakritik aavriti par compit karana aasaan he; duusari aavritiyon par compit karana bahut kathin he
 2) a vibrating object selects only the frequency which is equal to its natural frequency and vibrates at the same frequency from the complex force applied to vibrate it
 duusari avritiyon ko lagbhag nakaar detii he
 Thus, it acts as a filter
 3) kampan karne vaali adhikansh vastuon ke ek se adhik anunaad aavritiyaan hoti hai
 Swing: If while pushing the swing, keep in mind that the push should be given at the same interval which is the natural period of the swing, then the amplitude of that swing increases
 arthath har baar jhula apni madhyamaan sthiti se adhikadhik kone banaata chalaa jaataa he
 Conversely, if pushed to some other frequency without taking into account the above, the effect may be small, zero or negative
 radio evam doordarshan:radio or tivi ke andar ek tund paripath hota he jisaki sahaayta se kisi ek stesan yaa chanelle ko chunakar use suna yaa dekha he
 When we rotate the 'nab' of the radio, we are actually changing the resonant frequency of this tuned circuit
 kisi samay is paripath kii anunaad aavriti jis kisi stesan yaa chanelle kii aavriti se mail khaati he, vah chanelle hame praapt hota he
 Laser: Laser is an electromagnetic wave
 kintu isaki vishesh baat yah he ki yah atyanat samavarni hota he
 That is, the frequency of all its photons is equal to or very close to any one frequency
 iske saath hi sabhi compano kii kalaayen bhi samaan hote hai
 Lasers are also generated using optical resonance in an optical cavity
 kuch anya udhaaharan hai: If the resonant frequency of a linear oscillator is ω and it is being driven from a source with a frequency of तीव्रता, then the intensity of the oscillations i appears from the following equation: isamen γ us tantra ke damping kii sthiti ko vyakt karata he
 This is called linewith
 koi tantra jitna hi dampd hota he, uski linewith utani hi adhik hoti he
 The intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude
