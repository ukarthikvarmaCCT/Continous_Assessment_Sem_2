 shiksha ke arth ko samajhane main ye vichaar bhi hamaari sahaayta karte hai
 Some of the main ideas related to education are presented here: - pracheen bharat main shiksha kaa mukhya uddeshy ‘mukti’ kii chaah rahi he 
 Later, as time changed, education changed its purpose in the same way
 vyavastha kii drushti se dekhen to shiksha ke teen rup hote hai - Formal education formal education informal education vah shiksha jo vidyalayon, mahavidhyalayon or vishvavidhyalayon main chalati hai, aupchaarik shiksha kahi jaati he
 The objectives, curriculum and teaching methods of this education are all fixed
 yah yojanabaddh hoti he or isaki yojana badi kathor hoti he
 In this, learners have to work according to the time table of school, college or university
 isamen pariksha lene or pramaan patr pradaan karne kii vyavastha hoti he
 The greatest feature of this education is that it caters to the needs of the individual, society and the nation
 yah vyakti main gyaan or kaushal kaa vikaas karti he or use kisi vyavsaay athwa udyog ke liye yogya banaati he
 But this education is very expensive
 isse dhan, samay va urja sabhi adhik vyay karne padate hai
 Education that is not confined to the limits of schools, colleges, and universities, like formal education
 parantu aupchaarik shiksha kii tarah iske uddeshy va paathyacharya nishchit hoti he, fark keval uski yojana main hota he jo bahut lacheelee hoti he
 Its main purpose is to spread general education and to arrange education
 isaki paathyacharya seekhney waalon kii aavashyaktaaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar nishchit kii gai he
 Teaching methods and places and time of learning etc
 are decided according to the convenience of the learners
 praudh shiksha, satat shiksha, khuli shiksha or duurastha shiksha, ye sab niraupchaarik shiksha ke hi vibhinn rup hai
 The biggest feature of this education is that it educates children / persons who could not take advantage of formal education like - is shiksha dwaara vyakti kii shiksha ko nirantarataa bhi pradaan kii jaati he, unhen apane-apane kshetra ke nae-nae avishkaron se parichit karaayaa jaataa he or tatkaaleen aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye prashikshit kiya jaataa he
 Education that is not planned; Whose objectives are neither fixed nor curriculum and teaching methods and which continues to be incidental, it is called informal education
 yah shiksha manushya ke jivan bhar chalati he or iskaa us par sabase adhik prabhaav hota he
 Man keeps taking this education in every moment of life, every moment he keeps learning from the people and environment in his contact
 bachche kii pratham shiksha anaupchaarik vaataavaran main ghar main rahakar hi puri hoti he
 When he comes to take formal education in school, he comes with a personality which is a result of his informal education
 vyakti kii bhashaa va aacharan ko uchit disha dene, uske anubhavon ko vyavasthit karne, use uski ruchi, rujhaan or yogyatanusaar kisi bhi kaary vishesh main prashikshit karne tathaa jan shiksha ke prachaar evam prasar ke liye hamen aupchaarik or niraupchaarik shiksha kaa vidhaan karnaa aavashyak hota he

 bacileriesi kaai varg kaa ek kul he, jiske antargat diatem aate hai
 Its representatives are unicellular, of many shapes, types and forms
 jaise saamaanya bahumoortidarshi main kaach ke chote chote tukade anek rup ke dikhaai dete hai unheen roopon ke sadrush se diatem samooh bhi hote hai
 The cell of each diatom is richly siliculated and of this texture as if two petri dishes are kept close to each other
 prayek diatem kii jab upree tah se pariksha kii jaati he, to isaki dwiparshvik, yaa areey samamiti ke chihn spasht prathit hote hai
 The cell has one or several, variegated brownish-yellow pigments
 koshika ke bahya takshan ke aadhaar par diatmon kaa vargeekaran hota he
 Both cell walls of each diatom, including the internal process, are called fructules
 upree koshika bhitti apithika tathaa bhitari hypothika kehalaati he or donon kaa silikamay bhaag lagbhag chaude balve kaa hota he, jiske flanz sadrush upant sanyoji band yaa singulam se lage hote hai
 This connective band is often well connected with the wallb
 kabhi kabhi ek se adhik bhi sanyoji band hote hai
 These are called internal bands
 frestul ko valve kii chor se dekhne par valve tal tathaa sanyoji band kii ore se dekhne par valayital dikhaai detaa he
 According to Kupin, the material by which the frstule becomes silicable is aluminum silicate
 pimmersaal ke matanusaar jal madhyam main silicket lavenon kii prachurtaa se prajnan main sahaayta hoti he
 The silicon that collects in the valve is symmetrical around a central point in the centriole diatom
 pinnet diatmon main aksheeya pattica se yah dwiparshv samamit yaa asamamit ho saktaa he
 In some marine centriole diatoms, the cracking is sufficiently rough
 yah visheshat: yatra tatra gartarome ke kaaran hota he
 These grafts have finely umbilical holes
 kuch pinneliz diatmon main ek yaa adhik satya chhidr ho sakate hai, jo gaminheart ke anusaar madhya athwa dhruviya hote hai
 These thin spots, called punctates, are bipartite, configured in queues and a perpendicular plaque moving along the length of the valve, which may be called the axial region
 yah aksheeya kshetra banaavat main sam ho sakate hai, athwa inamen ek lambii zairi, raafe, ho sakati he
 The axillary region without long furrow is called cod rafe
 ek frestul ke donon valve ke aksheeya kshetra praaia: samaan hote hai, yadhyapi kuch genera main ek main raafe ho saktaa he tathaa duusare main kuta raafe
 a central gland is formed by the fixation of the wall in the middle of each passage, and there are also polar glands at both ends
 frestul ke bheetar protoplast main sarvapratham cytoplasm kii ek tah hoti he, jisamen ek yaa anek varnakan hote hai
 a round nucleus is located in some cytoplasm of the central part of a clear vacuole within and within the cytoplasm
 varnakan anek prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 Pyrenees are present in these, or they are not
 varnakan praaia: sunahare rang ke hote hai
 Safe food content is often fat
 raafe se yukt diatem gatisheel hote hai
 They move with a long axis shock
 ye jatke ek ke baad ek hote hai
 When something moves forward, the diatom stops with a stroke and comes back again
 mular ke matanusaar diatem kii yah gati cytoplasm main dhaaraon ke kaaran hoti he
 There is also cell division in the diatom
 is kriya main do santati-koshikaaye nirmit ho jaati hai, jo aapas main swabhaavat: choti badi hoti hai
 In addition to nucleation, pigmentation also divides
 koshika vibhaajan ke falswaroop ek anujaat protoplast kaa ansh ipithika ke bheetar rahata he or doosraa hypothika main
 After this, two new diatoms are formed in each progeny on the other side of the cell wall
 anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki navnirmit aadha bhaag sadaiv hypothika hoga tathaa purana avshisht bhaag chaahe vah pehle apithika rahaa ho yaa hypothika, is nae diatem main sadaiv apithika hoga
 From this one can imagine that in this way cells will gradually shrink in size as a result of each division, but in reality the new cells of small size become oxospores, and then regenerate cells of initial shape
 pinneliz rv main ye oxospore do koshikaon ke sanyugman se banate hai
 The conjugation of two cells will form two oxospores, or two cells can be joined together in a chola and each can form one auxospore without conjugation, or only one cell can form one auxospore, or one cell has two auxospores
 Can be made
 centreliz varg main laghu vijaanu bhi utpann hote hai
 Their number increases from 128 to 128 in the order of 4, 8, 16 within a cell

 According to Gaitler, this action is based on semiautonomy
 in laghu bijaanuon main kashabh bhi hote hai
 Many centriole diatoms have another type of spore, which is called the stratospore
 diatmon kaa vargeekaran mukhyat: shut ke vargeekaran ke aadhaar par hi hua he
 The main fact in this is the variation of cytoplasm

 Note that even after 1870 some Italian territories were not included in this organized Italy and they became part of it only after the First World War
 nepolian ke yudhon ke kaaran italysiyon ne ekta kii bhaavana kaa anubhav kiya or unhone apane desh ko ek raashtra ke rup main sangathit karne kaa nishchay kiya
 That is why the nationalism and liberal powers raised their heads several times, but they were crushed

 He used to lead the world in the field of education, art and science in ancient times
 atah ve ek baar phir se italy ko rashtrashiromani banane kaa sapana dekhne lage
 This is the reason that despite many difficulties and failures, the struggle for national integration continued there
 antim safalataa, pratikriyavaad ke viruddh udaarvaad or rashtriyata ko mili or italy ke ekikaran kaa kaary puraa ho sakaa
 This integration has a long history
 vienna congress ne jan-ichha or rashtriyata kii bhaavana kii avhelnaa kar italy main vividh rajyon kaa punarudwar kiya
 The new system of Italy made by him was as follows: is prakaar italy ko teen bhaagon main baant diya gaya tha
 There were different rulers among them
 rashtriyata kii drushti se yah anukool na tha, isliye vahaan ke log is vyavastha se asantusht the
 In such a situation, he tried to grant the status of one nation to the whole of Italy
 is kaary kii safalataa main anek baadhaayen thim, jinhen dur karnaa aavashyak tha
 After 1815 AD, three main problems of Italian patriots existed
 anek baadhaon ke baavjood italy ke deshbhakton ne rashtriya-ekta kaa prayaas aarambh kar diya
 For this, he formed several secret-committees, of which the carbonary was the most famous
 lagbhag saare italy main iskaa jaal bichaaya gaya
 Its inspiration led to several revolts in Italy, which were crushed by Metternich
 atah logon kaa yah vishwaas drudh ho gaya ki jab tak vahaan se austria kaa prabhaav samaapt nahin hoga tab tak ekta ke prayaas safal nahin honge
 See, Giuseppe Metsini italy ke rashtriya-ekikaran ke adarsh ko samyak rup dene kaa shrey mejini ko he
 He was born in 1805 in Geneva
 vah france kii rajyakanti se bada prabhavit tha
 The credit of which goes to his doctor father
 vah apane pita se prerana praapt kar kranti sambandhi sahitya kaa adhyayan karata rahaa, isiilie vah balykaal se hi krantikari vichaaron kaa poshak ho gaya
 After finishing his studies he became a member of the Carbonary
 udaar vichaaron ke kaaran vah 1830 i
 main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 He was imprisoned in Senona prison for almost a year
 jail se mukti ke baad usne ‘‘yuvak-italy’’ naamak sanstha kaa gathan kiya, jisase desh main raajnneetik jagriti ai
 Its member numbers continued to grow
 1833 i
 main yang-italy ke sadasyon kii sankhya 60 hajaar ho gayi
 He said that new ideas spread only when they are watered with the blood of the martyrs
 vah yuvakon ke netritv ko mahatvapurn maanata tha
 He was unhappy with the then system of the country and thought of a way to improve it
 usne desh kii janata ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki hamaari pratishtha or unnati avaruddh he
 We have a wonderful ancient tradition, but we do not currently have a national existence
 iske liye usne austria ko doshi bataaya
 Therefore, he organized against him and proclaimed the need to face him
 is prakaar mejini apane vichaaron se italy kii janata ko rashtriya-ekikaran ke liye protsaahit karata rahaa or unamem deshprem or balidaan kii bhaavana ko kuta-kootakar bharta rahaa
 He himself was a supporter of the republic and he also taught freedom lessons to others
 is prakaar vah italy ke swadhinata ke sangharsh kaa agradoot bana rahaa
 The French Revolution of 1848 also had an impact on Italy
 atah deshbhakton ne swatantraaa praapt karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He was not successful in this endeavor, but due to the fall of Metternich, his enthusiasm is due to Mezzini for perfecting Italy's ideal of national integration
 uskaa janm 1805 i
 main geneva main hua tha
 He was greatly influenced by the Kingdom of France
 jiskaa shrey uske doctor pita ko jaataa he
 He kept studying inspirational literature after getting inspiration from his father, so he became a foster of revolutionary ideas from childhood
 padhai samaapt karne ke baad vah carbonary kaa sadsy ban gaya
 Due to liberal views he was arrested in 1830 AD
 lagbhag ek varsh tak vah senona kii jail main kaid rahaa
 After his release from prison, he formed an organization called "youth-italy", which brought political awakening in the country
 isaki sadsy sankhya main nirantar vruddhi hoti gayi
 In 1833, the number of young-italy members increased to 60 thousand
 usne yah kaha ki naye vichaar tabhi failte hai jab use shheedon ke khun se sinchaa jaataa he
 He considered the leadership of the youth important
 vah desh kii tatkaaleen vyavastha se dukhi tha or usamen sudhaar laane kaa upaay sochataa tha
 Addressing the people of the country, he said that our reputation and progress is blocked
 hamaari shandaar pracheen parampara rahi he, par vartmaan main na hamaara koi rashtriya astitv nahin he
 He blamed Austria for this
 atah usne uske khilaaf sangathit hokar uskaa saamana karne kii aavashyaktaa pratipaadit kii
 In this way, Meiji, with his ideas, encouraged the people of Italy to national integration and filled them with a sense of patriotism and sacrifice
 vah swayan ganatantr kaa samarthak tha tathaa anya logon ko bhi vah swatantraaa kaa paath padhaata tha
 Thus he remained the forerunner of Italy's struggle for independence
 1848 i
 kii francisi kranti kaa prabhaav italy par bhi padaa
 Hence, the patriots tried to achieve independence
 is prayaas main unhen safalataa to nahin mili, parantu meternikh ke patan ke kaaran unka utsaah bana rahaa
 See, Victor Emanuel II peedmant kaa shaasha victor emanuel anya europea shaskaon se bhinn tha
 He was a supporter of nationalism and democraticism
 vah ek sachcha deshbhakt, vir or dhairyavan vyakti tha
 He played an important role in the unification of Italy
 yah udaaravaadi tha
 Impressed by his views, the people of the country gave him the title of an honest king
 yah janata ke bich kaaphi lokapriy ho gaya
 Kavoor was his worthy Prime Minister
 rashtriya maamalon main donon ke bich uchit talmail bana rahaa or donon ke vaanchit sahyog se rashtriya-ekikaran kaa kaary gati praapt karata rahaa
 Therefore, it would not be exaggerated to say that if Victor Emanuel had not been there, the task of unification of Italy would have been difficult if not impossible
 dekhen, chemil benso kavur The person who contributed most to the unification of Italy was named Count Camille de Cabour
 vah apane yug kaa ek mahatvapurn or kushal kootneetijna tha
 He was born in 1810 in a landlord family in Turin
 usne apana jivan ek sainik ke rup main aarambh kiya, par baad main usne uskaa parityag kar diya
 He was a supporter of legitimate state power and was influenced by the parliamentary system of England
 uskaa prabhaav desh main dhire-dhire badhata gaya
 In 1848, he became a member of the country's parliament
 apni yogyata ke bal par vah 1852 i
 main peedmant kaa pradhanmantri ban gaya
 As soon as he became Prime Minister, he paid special attention to the progress of the podium
 vah vyaavhaarik or drudh nishchayi vyakti tha
 He made it possible to unify Italy by acting according to the circumstances
 caboor kii yah manyata thi ki jab tak rajya majboot nahin hoga, tab tak vah apane sangharshon main safal nahin ho sakegaa
 Therefore, first of all, he tried to make the pedometer stronger by giving him the leadership of integration
 rajya ko sudrudh banane kii drushti se usne anek sudhaaron ko kriyanvit kiya
 Special efforts were made by him for the development of trade and business
 usne vyapaar ke kshetra main ‘‘khulaa chhod do’’ kii niti kaa anusaran karte hue vyavsaay ko rajkeey sangrakshan pradaan kiya
 Under his guidance, the development of means of transport was strengthened and the field of agriculture was developed
 shiksha kii unnati kii ore bhi vishesh dhyaan diya gaya
 He also implemented new reforms in the field of military and law
 bank sambandhi niyamon main anukool sudhaar kiye gayi
 In this way, he reformed all the organs of administration and made the administration of the state dynamic and strong
 uske in prayaason ke kaaran peedmant rajya kii bahumukhi unnati hui or ab vah ek shashakt rajya ban gaya
 After strengthening his foundation, he tried to get support from all classes of people
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki mejini or gariboldi jaise netaa usase sahyog karne ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 Thus he was successful in getting the support of majority of the people in the work of national integration
 caboor ek samajhadaar or vyavhaarik vyakti tha
 He realized that foreign aid was necessary to achieve his goal
 saubhaahgya kii baat thi ki vah apane is uddeshy main bhi safal hua
 He was keen to end Austria's influence in Italy, because without it he could not achieve his objectives
 vah bhaleebhanti samaj gaya tha ki austria ke khilaaf yadi koi europea rajya tatparta se sahyog pradaan kar saktaa he, to vah france he
 Therefore, he tried to please France
 iske liye usne kreemia ke yuddh main france kii sahaayta kii
 This war was fought in 1854 AD with the question of Eastern problem
 isaki samaapti 1856 i
 main paris kii sandhi dwaara hui
 Cabour also attended the conference to discuss the Treaty of Paris
 vah us sammelan main italian swadhinata ke daawey ko kushaltapurvak prastut karne main safal hua
 He advocated ending Italy's influence by blaming Austria for the pathetic state of the country
 uske dwaara die gaye tarkon se france kaa tatkaaleen raashtrapati nepolian tritiy prabhavit hua or usne italy ko sainik madad dena sweekaar kiya, aisa karne main uskaa apana nijee raajnneetik laabh tha
 He considered it necessary to be a participant in this work with a view to impressing the French people with its importance
 falswaroop june 1858 i
 main donon ke bich plambiars naamak sthaan par ek samjhauta hua, jo is prakaar tha- France will provide military aid to Italy to take Austria out of Italy's control, and in return for this aid Italy will give France the territory of Nice and service
 is prakaar videsh sahaayta praapt karne kii samasya kaa bhi samaadhaan ho gaya
 Now Cabour agreed to wage war against Austria
 france kii sahaayta kaa aashwaasan paakar caboor austria ke khilaaf yuddh karne ke liye tatpar tha
 Hence, at the behest of Cabur, there was a rebellion against Austria in Lombardy and Venetia
 vidroh kii sthiti ko dekhte hue austria yuddh kii anivaaryta ko samaj gaya
 As a result, in 1859 AD, war started on both sides
 yuddh jari hi tha ki achaanak france ne apane kaa yuddh se alag kar liya
 The reason for this was the willingness of Prussia to assist Austria in the war and to be expensive
 saath hi, nepolian ne yah anubhav kiya ki italy kaa sangathit hona france ke prati uchit na tha
 In such a situation, the Treaty of Zurich was signed between Italy and Austria, whose terms were as follows - is sandhi se italy santusht nahin hua, kyonkivenesia kaa austria ke adheen rahanaa use khal rahaa tha, phir bhi lombardi kii prapti ekikaran kii disha main ek badi uplabdhi thi, haalanki madhya or dakshin main ekikaran kaa kaary abhishesh tha
 The demand for independence was also increasing in the states of central-italy
 ye rajya bhi ab peedmant ke saath milane kaa prayaas karne lage the
 In 1860, the states of Modena, Parma and Tuscany, etc
, decided to meet in the piedmont by public opinion
 is prakaar madhya-italy ke rajyon kaa bhi ekikaran ho gaya
 Now only the states of south-italy remained to be organized
 shesh italy ko peedmant main shaamil karne kaa jo andolan chalaa usamen kisi videsh shakti kaa sahyog nahin liya gaya
 This was its own example of Italian nationality, headed by Gariboldi
 dakshin-italy ke pramukh rajya the - sicily or neples, jahaan burvo-vansh kii satta vidyaman thi
 See, Juzape Garibaldi gariboldi ne italy ke rashtriya-ekikaran ke kaary main mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 He was born in 1807 AD in Nice
 usne nau-sena kii shiksha praapt thi
 He was involved with maritime trade
 vah mejini se bada prabhavit tha, isiilie vah republican-dal kaa pakshpaati ho gaya tha
 The government was displeased with this liberal idea, so he was arrested
 sajaa se bachane ke liye vah dakshin-america bhaag gaya
 After living there for many years, he returned to Italy again in 1848 AD
 kranti main asafalataa praapt karne ke pashchaat vah punah america chalaa gaya
 He returned to Italy after earning a lot of money from there
 caboor or victor amenual ke saath usne sampark banaaye rakhaa
 Under his leadership, he organized the Lalkurti team, with which he succeeded in freeing Sisley and Naples and connecting them with the national stream
 in rajyon ko rashtriya dhara main jodne kaa kaary gariboldi ne kiya
 Sicily and Naples were two kingdoms in south-italy, where the Burvo-dynasty ruled
 yahan kii janata ne vidyaman shashan ke khilaaf vidroh kar diya or gariboldi se sahyog kii prarthana kii
 In response, Gariboldi, with the help of his army, took control of all Sicily by June 1860
 yah kaary saralata se sampann ho gaya
 Sicily is now incorporated into the kingdom of Piedmont
 iske pashchaat usne 1860 i
 main neples par bhi apana adhikaar kar liya
 On 6 September 1860, Francis II, ruler of Sicily and Naples, fled the country
 in donon kaaryon kaa sampadan usne desh-prem or rashtriyata kii bhaavana se prabhavit hokar kiya
 This is a unique example of his love and sacrifice for the nation
 1862 i
 main uskaa dehanth ho gaya
 At the parliament meeting on 18 February 1861 AD, Victor Emanuel was accepted as the ruler of Italy
 is uplabdhi ke baad 6 june 1861 i
 ko kaabur kii mrityu ho gayi
 Cabour is credited with making Italy a nation, with the cooperation of Mezzini, Garraboldi and Victor Emanuel
 caboor kii yah ichha thi ki rome sanyukt italy kii rajdhani bane, par vah abhi italy main shaamil nahin ho paaya tha
 In addition, Venezia was still under Austrian authority
 is prakaar italy ke ekikaran ke kaary main ye do kamiyaan abhishesh thim
 The task of unification of the German states was going on under the leadership of the Prime Minister of Prasha
 is kaary kii purnataa ke liye prasha ne 1866 i
 main austria ke khilaaf yuddh kar diya, jisamen italy bhi prasha kii ore se shaamil hua
 Prasha eventually succeeded in this war
 is sahyog ke lievenesia kaa rajya italy ko praapt ho gaya
 In October 1866, it was merged into the piedmont
 rome kaa pracheen vaibhav italysiyon ke liye gaurav kaaran tha
 They wanted to make him the capital of the new Italy state, but he still had the authority of the Pope
 1870 i
 main france or prasha ke bich yuddh chhid gaya
 In such a situation, France had to withdraw its army based in Rome
 germany ke ekikaran ke daur main yah yuddh sidan ke maidan main ladaa gaya, jisamen antim safalataa prasha ko mili
 This situation gave Italy a favorable opportunity to invade Rome, taking advantage of which she invaded Rome
 20 sitambar 1870 i
 ko italy ke senapati cadoni ne rome par italy kaa adhikaar sthapit kar liya
 Thus, this last wish of the Italian people was also fulfilled
 2 june 1871 i
 ko victor emanuel ne rome main pravesh kiya
 Inaugurating the Parliament of Italy, he said, is prakaar italy ke ekikaran kaa mahan kaary puraa ho sakaa
