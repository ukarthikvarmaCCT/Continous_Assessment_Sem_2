 The names of these seven verses are - Gayatri, Ushnik, Anushtupa, Brihati, Virat, Tritupa and Jagati

 Among the mantras of the Rigveda, Gayatri verses have the highest number except the trinity

 The awakened mind in the awakening is the great power of man
 jaise savita dev he vaise man bhi dev he 
 Mind is the motivator of life
 man or praan ke is sambandh kii vyakhya gayatri mantra ko isht he
 Savita Mana presides over all actions in the form of life, this truth is evident
 ise hi gayatri ke tisare charan main kaha gaya he
 The interpretation of Brahmanical texts is - Karmāni dhiya:, that is, what we call dhi or intelligence element is not only the thoughts or imagination of the mind, but those thoughts have to be tangible in form

 is gayatri mantra main anya kisi prakaar kii kaamana nahin pai jaati
 The only desire here is that the divine power that man has received from God in the form of mind, he should know the same savita and through deeds make him meaningful in this life

 a fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, leg guard and kickers
 Usually they wear safety equipment including wide extra chest guards, padded shorts, heavy padded hand protectors, blind guard, neck guards, arm guards and like all players, one should carry wood
 However, the only exception for taking a penalty stroke is such a player cannot cross the 23 meter line, if the field goalkeeper is going to the other end of the clock when the clock is stopped
 Goalkeepers can also take off their helmets for this action

 Semiconductors are those materials whose electrical conductivity is less than conductors but greater than conductors
 silicon, jarmenium, cadmium sulphide, gallium arsenid ityadi ardhchaalak padaarthon ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 In semiconductors, there is a 'band gap' between the conduction band and the valence band, which varies from 0 to 6 electron-volts
 
 Most semiconductors used to make electronic devices are elements of group IV of the periodic table, compounds of groups III and V, antimonide), or compounds of groups II and VI
 ardhchaalak padaarth ekal crystal ke rup main ho sakate hai yaa bahucristali powder ke rup main ho sakate hai
 At present, organic semiconductors have also been made, which are often multicomponent aromatic compounds

 The use of gallium arsenide is also widespread in the manufacture of ultra-efficient devices, but this material does not form wide boules, which makes it expensive to make semiconductor devices from gallium arsenide compared to silicon

 Ancient Nyayasutras first ten sutras in Sanskrit
jpg Akshapada, the author of the Nyasutra
 prakhyat nyaysutron ke nirmaataa kaa naam padmapurana, skandapurana tathaa vishwanath kii nyaayavritti main maharishi gotam yaa tehraaya gaya he
 In contrast, Akshpad is considered the author of these sutras in famous jurisprudential texts like Nyayabhashya, Nyayavartik, Tatpartika and Nyayamanjari
 mahakavi bhaas ke anusaar nyaayashastra ke rachayita kaa naam medhatithi he 
 a sentence of these different opinions can be proved
 mahabharat ke anusaar gautam medhatithi do vibhinn vyakti na hokar ek hi vyakti hai 
 Gautama is clearly a genealogical figure and medithi is a personal noun
 akshapaad kaa shabdaarth he - 'pairon main ankhwala'
 As a result, many stories have been devised to prove the meaning of this name, which are completely fictitious, baseless and proof zero
 naiyayik gautam ke bare main anek vidwaanon ne likhaa he
 Mahamahopadhyay Pt
 Harprasad Shastri states that Gautama, based on the translation of ancient Indian texts, composed in Chinese, preceded the Buddha, but the Nyasutra in his name is a second-century composition of Jesus
 satishchandra vidhyabhushan kaa mat he ki gautamiya dharmasutra tathaa nyayasutra kaa karta ek hi gautamanamdhari vyakti rahaa hoga
 They must have been contemporaries of Buddha and their time may have been 6th century BC
 parantu vidhyabhushan yah bhi maanate hai ki is gautam ne nyayasutra ke keval pehle adhyay kii rachana kii hogi
 The subsequent four chapters would have been written by someone else much later
 pro
 yakobi ke anusaar nyayasutra shoonyavad ke nagarjun dwaara pratishthapit ho jane ke baad or vigyaanavaad ke vikaas ke pehle likhaa gaya hoga kyonki isamen shoonyavad kaa to khandan he par vigyaanavaad kaa khandan nahin miltaa
 But Prof
 According to Sherwatsky, science has also been pointed out in the Nyasutra
 at: yah 500 i
 ke baad kii rachana hogi
 But Sherwatsky's view is confusing because of not understanding the Jurisprudence
 tarksangrah ke sampadak aathle tathaa boads ke anusaar gautam ke nyayasutra kanad se pehle ke hai
 Shabaraswamy quotes from Upvarsha which seems to suggest that Upvarsha was familiar with justice
 yadi yah upavarsh mahapadam nand ke mantri hi hai to gautam ko 400 i
pus
 kaa maananaa hi padegaa
 Pro
 According to Suali, these sutras date back to 300-350 AD
 richard garvey ke anusaar aastik darshanon main nyaay sabase baad kaa he kyonki isvi san ke aarambh ke pehle iskaa kahin koi ullekh nahin miltaa
 So these sutras must have been written between 100-300 AD
 in maton main koun sa sahi he yah kahana vartmaan sthiti main nitant asambhav he
 The composition of the Nyasutras and the period of Gautama should have different views on these two questions
 jahaan tak nyaysutron kaa prashn he, nishchay hi ye sutara buddhadarshan kaa vikaas ho jane par likhe gaye hai
 It can be said even more that amendments and additions have been made in this judicial from time to time
 paratu gautam kaa naam in sutron se isaliye sambandhit nahin he ki ye saare sutara apane vartmaan rup main gautam dwaara hi virachit hai
 We can only call Gautama the originator of jurisprudence, not the author of the sutras
 ho saktaa he, gautam ne kuch sutara likhe hon, par ve sutara anya sutron main itane ghulmil gaye hai ki unako alag nikaalnaa hamaare liye asambhav he
 From these points of view we find Vidyabhushan's opinion more valid
 gautam ko akshapaad bhi kehete hai
 Vidyabhushan considers Gautam as separate from Akshpad
 nyayasutra ke bhashyakaar tathaa anya vyaakhyaataaon ne akshapaad or gautam ko ek mana he
 The word 'akshapad' means 'one who has eyes in his feet'
 vyakaran mahabhashya gautam ke siddhanton se parichit he
 The Nyasutras have five chapters and this is the basic foundation of the Nyaya Darshan
 inaki samiksha se pataa chalata he ki nyaayadarshan aarambh main aadhyatm pradhan tha arthath aatma ke swaroop kaa yatharth nirnay karnaa hi iskaa uddeshy tha
 It used to take the support of logic and logic, but its main purpose was to introduce the nature of the soul through these means
 us yug kaa siddhant tha ki jo prakriya aatmatatv kaa gyaan praapt kara sakati he vahi thik tathaa maanya he
 It does not validate the distribution: parantu aage chalakar nyaay darshan main us tark pranali kii visheshtah udbhaavna kii gai jiske dwaara anatma se aatma kaa pruthak rup bhalee-bhanti samajha ja saktaa he or jisamen vaad, jalp, vitanda, chal, jati aadi sadhano kaa prayog hota he
 The creators of these rational jurisdictions appear to be Akshadapada

 Maharshi Agnivesh is the originator of the original book, but is considered as the antidote Charak

 The theorem is also considered in this philosophy but it has become secondary
 gyaan kya he, kaise utpann hota he, uski utpatti ke kitne strot hai, un stroton ke dosha koun koun se hai, inkaa vivechan nyaay kaa vishay he
 The word 'justice' in Indian tradition is synonymous with English logic or logic
 baudhon tathaa jainon ne bhi apni tarkpaddati chalaai he or unhen bhi buddhanyay tathaa jainanyaay kaha jaataa he
 But where only the word justice has been used, 'justice' implies only the principles propounded by the sect

 The number of all sources is 530
 pratham adhyay main saamanyat: un 16 vishyon kaa varnan kiya gaya he jinka vistrut pratipaadan baad ke chaar adhyyon main hua he
 The second chapter discusses skepticism and evidence
 tisare adhyay ke pratipaadya vishay hai aatma, sharir, indriya, indriyon ke vishay, gyaan tathaa man
 The fourth chapter, while discussing the nature of desire, sorrow, tribulation and salvation, also sheds light on the nature of illusions and the relation between ingredients and ingredients

 The seven substances accepted in the Vaishika philosophy become in the theorem
 isiliye parvarti naiyayikon ne nyaay ko vaisheshik ke saath sambhddha kar diya he
 Justice mainly describes the method of debate
 kaise kisi siddhant kaa upasthaapan kiya jaataa he, siddhant ke prati kitne akshep ho sakate hai, unka parihaar kis tarah kiya ja saktaa he, ye hi nyaay ke mukhya pratipaadya hai, kaha jaataa he, ki gautam ne hi sarvapratham anumaan ke paanch avyavonvale vaakya kaa prachlan kiya
 According to the Greek philosopher Aristotle, the inference is concluded in only three sentences
 vidhyabhushan ke anusaar bhartiya nyaay main avyavaatmak vaakya kii kalpana arestu ke prabhaav se utpann hui he
 But Professor Keith maintains that there is no basis for assuming the influence of Greek ideology in the early stages of justice
 gautam kii panchavyav vaakya kii kalpana unke mastishk kii hi upaj he
 Justice has been perhaps the most influential departure of Indian philosophy
 nyaysutron main pratipaadit siddhanton kaa buddha acharya nagarjun ne khandan kiya
 To answer Nagarjuna, Vatsyayan composed a commentary on the Nyasutras

 Gangeshopadhyay, the promoter of Navyanya, and his followers also wrote several texts following the path shown by Gautama
 nyaayadarshan ne anek bhartiya darshanon ko prabhavit tathaa tarkpaddati kii udbhaavna dekar prerit kiya he
 Justice is one such sect which is still being widely discussed among the pundits
 gautam ishwarwadi the yaa nahin, yah kahana kathin he kyonki unke sutron main ishwar kaa spasht nirdesh kahin nahin he
 Later, the rendering of God became a feature of justice
 mokshavastha main nyaay ke anusaar aatma apane saare gunon se rahit hokar apane shuddh dravya rup main avasthit rahati he
 Beyond the intellect, happiness, sorrow, desire, malice, effort and samskara, when the soul becomes in a state of blissful form of sorrow, it is called liberated

 prayek charan main ek vishisht vikasaatmak maanak hota he, jise puraa karne main aane vaali samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karnaa aavashyak hota he
 According to Erickson, the problem is not a crisis, but an important point that increases sensitivity and strength
 samasya kaa vyakti jitani safalataa ke saath samaadhaan karata he uskaa utana hi adhik vikaas hota he
 Erickson believes that proper solutions to problems encountered at different stages may not always be positive
 kabhi-kabhi samasya ke rinatmak pakshon se parichay bhi aprihaary ho jaataa he
 For example, you cannot trust all people equally in every situation of life
 phir bhi charan main aane vaali vikasaatmak maanak kii samasya ke sakaaratmak samaadhaan se hoti he
 Positive commitment about that is effective

 ativishisht vyakti un vyaktiyon ko kehete hai jinhen unki pratishtha yaa unke mahatv ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch vishesh adhikaar yaa suvidhaayen pradaan kii jaatin hon
 For example, the head of state, other politicians, big employers, rich people etc
 gaison kii sahaayta se weldon kii kriya ek si hoti he, lekin unka vibhaajan upyog main aanevaali gas ke anusaar kiya jaataa he
 These gases are often a mixture of oxygen and acetylene, coal gas and hydrogen etc
 inamen se oxi-asitilin weldon sabase adhik prachlit he
 Commercial companies producing weld gases sell the gas in welded steel cylinders for welding at the pressure of several atmospheres
 weldon ke bade-bade kaarkaanon main nijee gas janitron dwaara calcium carbide or pani ke mishran se yah gas kam dabas par taiyaar kii jaati he
 Dissolving acetylene in acetone does not cause explosion
 chaahe kisi bhi prakaar kii gas kaa vyavhaar kiya jaae, weldon ke liye use kisi prakaar kii phunkani ke dwaara hi weldon ke sthaan par pahunchaaya jaataa he, jinamein lage ek balve kii sahaayta se gas ke bahaav par niyantran kar uchit aakaar kii lau bana lee jaati he
 Figure 4
 The figure of a is shown in the shape of a fingertip on the mouth of a blower and in b the shape of a flame
 lau ko choti, badi, patali yaa moti banane ke liye vibhinn naapon ke jet phunkani par adal badalakar lagaae jate hai
 The jet's measurement means that its strength is determined according to the gas cost per hour
 sabase chote jet dwaara ek ghante main ek ghan foot or sabase bade jet dwaara lagbhag 200 ghan foot gas kharch ho jaati he tathaa phunkani main gas kii daab 2 se 8 pound prati varg inch tak rakhi jaati he
 During the experiment, the acetylene gas is first opened and burnt at the mouth of the jet, then the valve of the oxygen cylinder is slowly opened so that the proper type of flame is formed
 jalanevaali gas ke mishran main adhik asitilin hone se uski lau carburikar hokar kuch moti pad jaati he, lekin vah aarambh se ant tak ek si tej chamakdaar bani rahati he
 If there is an excess of oxygen in the mixture, the flame becomes oxidizing and the trunk becomes long and bright, but by making appropriate adjustments in the amount of both types of gases, the bright part of the trunk that forms the flame is small
 And is clearly shaped and has the highest temperature at its tip, as shown in Figure 4
 at: jhaal lagaate samay dhaatu ko galane ke liye lau ko dhaatu kii sataha se lagbhag 1 / 8 inch se 1 / 16 inch tak dur rakhaa jaataa he
 When welding, the collisions of the objects to be welded are melted at the joint by a flame of gas from above, which mixes the metals of the two parts together, and at the same time some of the same kind of surplus metal, which is thin
 It is in the form of lights and also called as filler or light, it is filled in the throat and after it gets cold, a solid joint is formed
 phunkani ko chalaane kii do tarkiben hoti hai, ek to baayein haath kii or duusari daahine haath kii
 In left-handed action, Weldon's work moves from the right to the left, causing the flame to tilt towards the flattened part, and holding the flicker with the right hand and holding the light with the left hand
 weldon karte samay phunkani weldon kii janevaali vastu se 60 se 70 ansh kaa kone or dhaatu kii batti 30 40 ansh kaa kone banaati he
 In the action of the right hand, the mouth of the flame is inclined towards the jagged part and the process of welding increases from right side to right side
 baayein haath se beldon karte samay phunkani kaa pani kii laharon jaise chalaaya jaataa he or daahine haath ke weldon main phunkani ko bahut hi kam yaa bilkul hi nahin laharaaya jaataa, lekin batti ko gol chhallon ke aakaar main ghumaate hue, chalaaya jaataa he
 The diameter of the light should be in proportion to the thickness of the welded object and the size of the blower
 patali batti swayan to jaldi gal jaaegi or weldit kiya janevaala jod garam hokar galit avasthaa main aane bhi nahin paaegaa
 If the light is too thick, it will itself be a late hug and will quickly cool off the already sore parts of the object
 is prakaar kii phunkani kaa rivaaj aajkal badhata ja rahaa he
 In this, two flames come out together, the forward flame serves to heat the metal in advance, which costs a little more acetylene, but the advantage is that it keeps the plates from oxidizing by carbureting, because at that time Due to the absorption of carbon in the plates, their lowering point decreases and the last small flame makes it work easily as soon as it reaches there
 is prakaar kii lau se welding kiye janevaale bhaagon main sikudan or anthan ke dosha kaa bhi parihaar ho jaataa he tathaa weldon kaa kaam bhi shighrata se hota he

 ) According to mythology, there was a king named Sudhanwa in ancient times
 ve ek din akhet ke liye van gayi
 It was only after he left that his wife became menstruated
 usne is samachar ko apni shikari pakshi ke madhyam se raja ke paas bhijwaya
 After receiving the news, Maharaj Sudhanwa took out his semen in one and gave it to the bird
 pakshi us done ko raja kii patni ke paas pahunchaane akaash main ud chalaa
 On the way, that predatory bird found another predatory bird
 donon pakshiyon main yuddh hone laga
 During the war, he got rid of both bird's claws and fell into Yamuna
 yamuna main brahma ke shaap se machhlee bani ek apsara rahati thi
 The nymph of fish swallowed semen flowing in both and due to its effect she became pregnant
 garbh purna hone par ek nishad ne us machhlee ko apane jaal main fasaa liya
 When Nishad cut the fish, a boy and a girl came out of his stomach
 nishad un shishuon ko lekar maharaj sudhanva ke paas gaya
 Due to not being the son of Maharaj Sudhanwa, he kept the child with him, named Matsyaraj
 balika nishad ke paas hi rah gai or uskaa naam matsaygandha rakhaa gaya kyonki uske angon se machhlee kii gandh nikalati thi
 That girl is also known as Satyavati
 badi hone par vah naav khene kaa kaary karne lagi ek baar parashar muni ko uski naav par baith kar yamuna paar karnaa padaa
 Parashar Muni Satyavati became enamored of beauty and said, "devi! i want to cum with you
 " satyavati ne kaha, "muniver! aap brahmagyani hai or main nishad kanya
 We do not have sex
 " tab parashar muni bole, "balike! tum chintaa mat karo
 You will remain a virgin even after childbearing
 " itnaa kah kar unhone apane yogabal se chaaron ore ghaney kuhare kaa jaal rach diya or satyavati ke saath bhoga kiya
 After that, while blessing him, he said, the smell of fish coming out of your body will turn into fragrant
 " When the time came, Satyavati had a son from Vedas, who passed from the womb
 janm hote hi vah balak bada ho gaya or apni mata se bolaa, "mata! tu jab kabhi bhi vipatti main mujhe samaran karegi, main upasthit ho jaaungaa
 "having said this, he went to the island of Dwaipayan to do penance
 dwaipayan dweep main tapasya karne tathaa unke sharir kaa rang kaala hone ke kaaran unhe krishna dwaipayan kaha jane laga
 Later on he became famous by the name of Ved Vyas because of commenting on the Vedas
 hindu dharm shastron ke anusaar maharishi vyas trikalgya the
 And seeing from the divine point of view, he knew that religion would be weakened in Kali Yuga
 dharm ke ksheen hone ke kaaran manushya naastik, kartavyaheen or alpaayu ho jaavenge
 Sangopang study of a huge Veda will be out of their power
 isiliye maharishi vyas ne veda kaa chaar bhaagon main vibhaajan kar diya jisase ki kam buddhi evam kam smaranshakti rakhane vaale bhi vedon kaa adhyayan kar saken
 Vyas Ji named him - Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda
 vedon kaa vibhaajan karne ke kaaran hi vyas ji veda vyas ke naam se vikhyath huye
 Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda taught their disciples Pal, Jaimin, Vaishampayan and Sumantumuni respectively
 veda main nihit gyaan ke atyant gudh tathaa shushk hone ke kaaran veda vyas ne paanchave veda ke rup main puraanon kii rachana kii jinamein veda ke gyaan ko rochak kathaon ke rup main bataaya gaya he
 He taught the Puranas to his disciple Rome Harshan
 vyas ji ke shishyone apni apni buddhi ke anusaar un vedon kii anek shakhaayen or up shakhaayen bana deen

 The famous festival of Guru Purnima is celebrated to commemorate the birth anniversary of Vyas ji
 puraanon tathaa mahabharat ke rachayita maharishi kaa mandir vyasapuri main vidyaman he jo kaashi se paanch mile kii duuri par sthit he
 In the Ramnagar fort of Maharaja Kashi Naresh, there is a statue of Vyeshwar in the western part, which is known by the common people as Chhota Ved Vyas
 vastav main vedavyas kii yah sab se pracheen murti he
 Visvesvara expelled Vyasji from Kashi due to Vyasji cursing Kashi
 tab vyasaji lolark mandir ke aagney kone main gangaji ke purvi tat par sthit hue
 The mention of this incident in Kashi section is as follows- lolarkadan agnidigbhage, swarghuni purvarodhsi
 Situ Hydyapya Pashchets: Kashiprasad Rajikam
 
 Skanda Purana, Kashi Block 96 / 201 vyasaji ne puraanon tathaa mahabharat kii rachana karne ke pashchaat brahmasutron kii rachana bhi yahan kii thi
 Like Valmiki, Vyas is also a derivative of Sanskrit poets
 mahabharat main upakhyanon kaa anusaran kar anek sanskrit kaviyon ne kavy, naatak aadi kii sristi kii he
 In relation to the Mahabharata itself, Vyasji's statement is more accurate - what is in this text is elsewhere, but what is not in it is nowhere else
 kalapi main yamuna ke kisi dweep main inkaa janm hua tha
 Vyasji was called Krishna Dwaipayana because his color was black
 ve paidaa hote hi maan kii ajna se tapasya karne chale gayi the or kah gayi the ki jab bhi tum samaran karogi, main aa jaaoongaa
 He was not only the father of Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidur, but he also supported the Pandavas in the form of a shadow in times of calamity
 unhone teen varshon ke athak parishram se mahabharat granth kii rachana kii thi- Tribhirvarshe: Sadotthayi Krishnadvaipayanomuni:
 mahabharatamakhyaanan kritvaadi mudtamam
 
 adiparv - When he saw the deterioration of religion, he made Vyasa, the department of Veda, and called Ved Vyas
 vedon kaa vibhaag kar unhone apane shishy sumantu, jaimini, pel or vaishampayan tathaa putr shukdev ko unka adhyayan karaayaa tathaa mahabharat kaa upadesh diya
 Because of your supernatural talent, you are considered an incarnation of God
 sanskrit sahitya main valmiki ke baad vyas hi sarvshereshth kavi hue hai
 His poetry is known by the name of 'arsha Kavya'
 vyas ji kaa uddeshy mahabharat likh kar yuddh kaa varnan karnaa nahin, balki is bhautik jivan kii ni:sarataa ko dikhaanaa he
 His statement is that even if a man gets to know the Vedang and the Upanishads, he can never be learned because this Mahabharata is simultaneously economics, theology and kamshastra
