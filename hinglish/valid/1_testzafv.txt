 iske prachlan kii desh or kaalparak seemayen brahmi kii apeksha sankuchit raheen or bina kisi pratinidhi lipi ko janm die hi desh se iskaa lop bhi ho gaya
 The existence of another sophisticated script like Brahmi or the natural tendency to write from left to right of the country may have been the reason for the extinction of this script
 prarambh main iske padhane kaa prayaas karanevaale europea vidwaanon ne ise bactrean, indo-bactro-pali yaa ariuno-pali jaise naam die the
 The name Kharoshthi is in the list of 64 scripts mentioned in Lalitavistar
 iske naam kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main anek mat hai jinamein sarvaadhik maanya prajluski kaa he
 According to him, the basic of Kharoshthi is Kharpost
 post irani bhashaa kaa vah shabd he jiskaa arth 'khaal' hota he
 In Mahamayuri, Kharposta is the name of a corporator from northwest India
 chini parampara ke anusaar iskaa avishkaar rishi kharoshth ne kiya tha
 Whatever the derivation of the name of the script, there is no doubt that in this country it came from the northwest and, for some time, except Ashoka, used only by foreign princes in their own sphere of influence, ended with them
 kharoshtee lipi ke udhaaharan prastarshilpon, dhaatunirmit patron, bhaandon, sikkon, murtiyon tathaa bhurjpatr aadi par uplabdh hue hai
 The earliest accounts of Kharoshthi have been found from Taxila and around Char, but its main area was North Western India and Eastern Afghanistan
 mathura se bhi kuch kharoshtee abhilekh praapt hue hai
 Apart from these, the letters or words written in Kharoshthi have also been found from Siddapur in South India, Ujjain and Mysore
 mukhya seemaa ke uttar evam uttar purvi pradeshon se bhi kharoshtee lekhonvaale sikke, murtiyan tathaa kharoshtee main likhe hue pracheen granth uplabdh hue hai
 BC From the fourth to the third century CE, Kharoshthi was prevalent in northwestern India up to Mathura
 kushanyug ke baad is lipi kaa bharat se baahar chini turkistan main pravesh hua or kam se kam ek shatabdi vah vahaan jivit rahi
 The most popular opinion regarding the emergence of Kharoshthi is that the Hakhamani rulers had to adopt the Armaei script used in Assuria and Babylon for governance purposes, and with its rule, it entered northwest India
 aavashyaktavash kuch bharatiyon ko ise siikhnaa padaa, kintu baad main brahmi ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par isamen parivartan hue or is prakaar kharoshtee kaa janm hua
 Its promotion mainly in the territory occupied by Iran of India, the use of ancient Persian scripts and the scriptural words derived from it in the records of Ashoka, the absence of ellipses, the existence of Kharoshthi letters with Brahmi letters on Iranian hurt coins and some of the Kharoshthi characters
 Equivalence with armae varna and the emergence of armae varna from many are nutrients of this belief
 prayek vyanjan main a kii vidyamanata, dirghaswaron evam swarmatraaon kaa abhaav, anya swarmatraaon kaa rujudandon dwaara vyaktikaran, vyanjanon ke purv pancham varnon ke liye savantra anuswaar kaa prayog tathaa sanyuktakshron kii alpata kharoshtee lipi kii kuch visheshtaayen hai
 Its characteristics and the cursive nature of varnas prove that it was the script of clerks and merchants etc
 But the manuscript obtained from Khotan written in Khoshasti also proves the existence of a second sophisticated form, which was used in the writing of scriptures

 During his lifetime, he was more famous for his novels, while he considered himself primarily a poet
 hardi kii angreji sahitya ko mahatvapurn dein he
 He made a special study of a small region and created regional literature
 hindi main is prakaar ke sahitya ko aanchalik sahitya kah rahe hai
 He raised the basic questions in his literature regarding human life and provided the novel which was the epic and sad drama in the past

 His novels are called 'novels of Wessex' and his poem 'poetry of Wessex'

 For many years he continued to study in a school run by Mr
 Last
 yahaan unhone latin bhashaa sikhi or shaikshik pratibha kaa parichay diya
 But the social status of Hardy's family was not such that he could be sent to university for education, and at the age of 16, his formal education ended and he became an apprentice to John Hicks, a local architect
 dorchester main vaastukar ke rup main prashikshit hokar hardi 1862 main landan chale gaye; vahaan unhone kings college, landan main chaatr ke rup main daakhila liya
 He won awards from the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Architectural Association
 landan main hardi ko kabhi apnaapan anubhav nahin hua
 He was very conscious of class division and his social inferiority
 tathaapi, saamaajik sudhaar main unki dilchaspee thi or vah jon stuart mil ke kaam se parichit the
 During this period, his Dorset friend Horace Moll introduced him to the work of Charles Fournier and Auguste Comte
 Five years later, due to his health he returned to Dorset and decided to dedicate himself to writing

 Though he later separated from his wife, his death in 1912 caused him a deep shock
 uski mrityu ke baad, apane pranay sambandh se jude sthanon kii dobaaraa yatra karne hardi cornwall gaye, poems 1912-13 main uski mrityu kii chhap milti he
 In 1914, Hardy married his secretary Florence Emily Dugdale, 39 years younger than him
 phir bhi vah apni pehali patni kii maut se ubhar nahin paae or kavy-lekhan se apane dukh ko bhulane kii koshish karte rahe
 In December 1927, Hardy succumbed to pleurisy and passed away after writing his final poem to his wife at 9 pm on 11 January 1928; The cause of death was cited in the death certificate, "heartburn", "old age" was cited as a contributing factor
 16 janvari ko unka antim sanskaar westminster ebe main hua jo ek vivaadaaspad avasar sabit hua kyonki hardi, unke parivaar or mitron kii ichha thi ki unhen stinsuard main unki pehali patni yema kii kabr main hi dafanaaya jaae

 Shortly after Hardy's death, the executors of his estate burned his letters and notebooks

 His research showed how Hardy kept an eye on him and how he used them in his later work

 apni aatmakatha gudby tu ol dait main robert grevs ne 1920 ke dashak ke shuru main dorset main hardi ke saath bhent kii yaad ko tazaa kiya he
 Hardy warmly welcomed him and his new wife and praised her work
 1910 main, hardi ko order of merit se sammanit kiya gaya
 Hardy's houses at Bockhampton and Max Gate in Dorchester are owned by the National Trust
 hardi ne kavitalekhan se sahityaseva aarambh kii, kintu praathmik rachanaayen unhone nasht kar deen
 From 1870 to 1898 he enriched the narrative
 ve jivan or sansar ke parichaalan main koi nyaay athwa vyavastha na dekhte the unke anusaar ek andhi shakti is jagat ke kaaryakalapon kaa parichaalan karti thi
 He used to call this blind power 'willful' - the demeanor that lies in life and the world
 apane kathasahitya main hardi ne jagat ke vyapaaron par apana akraman uttarottar adhik tikhaa kiya
 In earlier novels it is relatively mild
 1879 main unki pehali uplabdh rachana prakashit hui, 'desparat remedies', 1872 main duusari, 'under di greenwood tree' or 1873 main teesri 'e peyar ov blue ij'
 The next work 'far from the Madding Crowd' is a more mature work and gained fame after its publication
 aatmavishvaas praapt kar hardi ne vishwa kii gati par apana aghat adhik teevr kar diya
 The best works of this period are - 'the Woodlanders', 'the Return of the Native', 'the Trumpet Major' and 'the Mayor of Wasterbridge'
 iske baad do upanyaas or likhe gaye jinamein hardi ghor niraashaa main dub gaye hai
 Fearing the critics, Hardy quit writing novels and began writing poetry
 bees varsh tak unhone kavita likhi or apane liye khyaati ke nae dwaar khole
 Hardy continued to express his views in poetry as well, but the trauma expressed in the poems did not maim readers and critics to that extent
 hardi kaa kahana tha ki 'yadi galileo ne kavita main likhaa hota ki prithvi gumti he, to shaayad unhen itani takalif na sahani padati
 Hardy turned to the first love of his literary life by adopting poetry once again
 isi bich inhone apni sabase mahatvapurn kriti 'di dyenasts' likhi
 It was published in three parts
 yah rachana naatak ke rup main mahakavy he
 It cannot be played at physical theater
 iskaa abhinay kalpana ke manch par hi sambhav he
 The story relates to Napoleon's expedition
 yah vishwavijeta bhi krur niyati kaa shikaar tha
 The power of life keeps rotating the cycle and all the virtuous and vicious people keep grinding in it
 is rachana main hardi kaa vichaardarshan bahut spashtataa se vyakt hry he
 Hardy's family believed in the Anglican Church but were not staunch followers
 paanch saptaah kii umr main unka baptism hua or vah carch ko jaaya karte the, jahaan unke pita or chachaa sangeet ke liye yogadan dete the
 Still he did not attend the school of the local Church of England, he was sent to Mr
 Last's school three miles away
 noujvaan yuva ke rup main, unki dosti henri aar
 basto se hui jisane vaastukar chaatr ke rup main bhi kaam kiya or jo baptist carch main vayask baptism kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 Hardy considered converting but decided not to convert again
 basto australia chalaa gaya, lambey arase tak unke bich patrachaar chalata rahaa lekin antat hardi is aadan-pradaan se thak gaye or patrachaar band ho gaya
 With this, Hardy's relationship with Baptist ended
 jivan main bhagya ke bare main hardi kaa vichaar parameshwar ke saath darshanik sangharsh main parilakshith hua
 Although Hardy's faith remained intact, he questioned the traditional Christian view of God because of the irony and struggles of life: hardi ke dharmik jivan main agyeyavaad, aastikta or aadhyatmavaad kaa mila-jula rup dekhne ko miltaa he
 Once, when a pastor asked the letter to reconcile the torture of suffering with the righteousness of the loving God, Hardy replied, phir bhi, hardi aksar brahmad ko niyantrit karne vaali alokik shaktiyon ke bare main sochaa karte the or likhaa karte the, vah aisa kisi drudh vishwaas kii bajaae nirpeksh bhav main or mouj main aakar karte the
 In addition, Hardy's writings also reveal to some extent his attraction to ghosts and spirits
 in bhaawanaaon ke baavjood, hardi isai upasna or carch kii rasmon se bhaavnaatmak rup se jude rahe, visheshkar jo gramin samudaayon main prachlit hai, jivan ke praarambhik varshon main un par inkaa bahut nirmaanatmak prabhaav padaa or hardi ke anek upanyaason main bible sandarbhon kii bharmaar dekhi ja sakati he
 Hardy's friends included Horace Moll and poet William Barnes, both pastors, during John Hicks' apprenticeship here
 mal zindagi bhar hardi ke kareebi dost rahe or bible kii shabdic vyakhya par andeh uthaane vaali nai vaigyanik khojon se jaise ki gidon mentel kii, unka parichay karavaaya 
 mal ne 1858 main hardi ko mentel kii pustak da vanders of jiyology kii prati di, adelin bacland kaa vichaar he ki mentel ke bhuvaigyanik varnan or e peyar of blue aaiz ke "clifahanger" vaale khand main "akatya samanthaayen" hai
 It has also been suggested that the character of Henry Knight in a Pair of Blue Eyes was based on Horace Moll
 1867 main purna kiya gaya hardi kaa pehla upanyaas, da pier main and da ladi ko prakashit karne ke liye koi prakaashak raji nahin hua or hardi ne pandulipi nasht kar di, isliye upanyaas ke kuch hisse hi uplabdh hai
 His mentor and friend, Victorian novelist and poet George Meredith, encouraged him to try again
 desparit remedies or under da greenwood tree agyaat rup se prakashit kiye gaye the
 In 1873 Hardy's novel a Pair of Blue Eyes, based on his love for his first wife, was published under his own name
 "clifahanger" shabd kaa udbhav is kahani ke dharawahik roopaantar se mana jaataa he jisamen ek nayak henri nite ko vastav main chattan se latakta hua chhod diya jaataa he
 Hardy said that he first introduced Wessex in his next novel, From the Madding Crowd
 yah itnaa safal rahaa ki hardi ne vaastushilp kaa kaam chhodkar sahitya ko apni jivan-vritti ke rup main apana liya
 Over the next twenty-five years, Hardy wrote more than ten novels
 hardi parivaar landan se yeovil or phir sterminster newton chalaa gaya, jahaan unhone da ritern of da netive kii rachana kii
 In 1885, he moved to Max Gate, a house designed by Hardy outside Dorchester and built by his brother
 yahaan unhone da meyar of casterbrij, da woodlanders or tess of di diurbarwills likhe, inamen se antim upanyaas main "patit stri" ke sahanubhutipurna chithran kii kaafii aalochana kii gai or shuru main iske prakaashan se inkaar kar diya gaya tha
 Its subtitle, a Pure Woman: Faithfully Presented, was intended to point fingers at the middle class of the Victoria era
 1895 main prakashit jud da obscyor main yon ke mukt vivechan kii victorian janata ne ore bhi ninda kii or ise praayah "jud da obsin" kahkar pukaara jaataa tha
 Highly condemned for hurting the institution of marriage by presenting concepts like orgasm, the book put further negative pressure on Hardy's previously disastrous marital life as Emma Hardy worried that Jude the Obscure was read as an autobiography Will go
 Some booksellers sold the novel in brown envelopes and it is said that the Bishop of Wakefield burned his copy
 1912 ke apane upsanhaar main, hardi ne is ghatana kaa hawala mazaaq ke taur par pustak ke karier kaa bhaag kahkar diya: "press ke in faisalon ke baad iskaa aglaa durbhaagya ek bishap dwaara jalaayaa janaa tha - shaayad mujhe na jala paane kii hataasha main"
 Despite this criticism, by the early 1900s, Hardy had made his place in English literature by writing several highly successful novels, but public reaction to his two great works aroused disinterest and left him writing the novel altogether
 hardi dwaara likhit anya upanyaason main shaamil he khagol vigyaan ke jagat par aadhaarit ek prem kahani tu on e tower Although he wrote a lot of poems but remained mostly unpublished until 1898, Hardy is best remembered for his series of novels and short stories written between 1871 and 1895
 unke upanyaas vesex, dakshin or dakshin pashchim england kaa vishaal kshetra jiskaa naam us kshetra ke anglo-sackson rajya ke naam par padaa, ke kaalpanik jagat kii prishthbhumi main rachit hai
 Hardy was part of two worlds
 apane bachapan ke gramin jivan se bhi unka gaharaa bhaavnaatmak lagaav tha par saath hi vah ho rahe parivartanon or prachlit saamaajik samasyaon, krishi kshetra main nawacharon se - audyogic kranti ke kaaran angreji dehaat main hue parivartanon se zaraa pehle ke yug kii nabz pakadaney se lekar - victorian samaaj ke yon vyavhaar ke anauchity or paakhand ke prati vah jaagruk the Hardy was a critic of social bonds that hampered the lives of people living in the 19th century
 victoria kaal ke yathartwaadee lekhak maane jane vaale hardi ne saamaajik bandhanon ko parkhaa jo victorian yathasthiti kaa hissaa hai or mana ki ye bandhan sabhi shaamil logon ke jivan main baadha daalate hai or aakhirkaar dukh kaa kaaran banate hai
 In Two on a Tower, Hardy is seen voicing these rules and creating a story against the backdrop of social structure, a tale of love that transcends class boundaries
 pathak prem ke liye sthapit paramparaon ko todane kaa vichaar karne par majaboor ho jaataa he
 These traditions are applicable in nineteenth-century society and social pressure ensures their compliance
 swithin saint clive kaa adarshavaad unhen samakaleen saamaajik bandhanon ke mukaable main khadaa kar detaa he
 a self-willed man has to face strict control of social rules and ethics
 hardi kii kahaniyaan jivan kii ghatnaon or unke prabhaavon par vichaar karti hai
 Luck plays an important role as a thematic basis for many of his novels
 paatr nirantar swany ko jivan ke chauraahey par khadaa pate hai jo avasar or parivartan ke bindu kaa pratik he
 Far from the Madding Crowd tells a story of life created by coincidence
 "udaahranarth agar bathsheba ne velntin na bheja hota, agar faini uski shaadi par maujuud hoti, to kahani ne ekadam alag mode le liya hota
" samay kaa chakra chal padaa he to puraa hokar hi rahegaa
 hardi ke paatr bhagya ke shikanje main fanse hai
 Hardy portrays a lively depiction of 19th century rural life, a world full of superstitions and injustice, with all its joys and sorrows
 unke nayak or nayikaayen aksar samaaj se kate hue hote hai or unhen shaayad hi kabhi dobaaraa apanaaya jaataa he
 He represents mainly middle class people in his novels and emphasizes the emotional and negative forces of fate
 apni pustakon main hardi moulik junun, gahari bhaavana or agyeya parivartan kaa shikaar ghaatak evam galat avadharana vaale kanoonon ke khilaaf sangharsh karti maanviya ichha ko darshaate hai
 For example, Tess of the Deurberville ends: vishesh rup se, hardi kaa upanyaas jud da obscyor antim victoria kaal ke sankat kii bhaavana se ot-prot he 
 It describes the tragedy of two new social types, Jude Foley, the working man who strives to be self-educated, and his girlfriend and cousin Sue Brideshead who represents the 'new woman' of the 1890s
 unki maharath, lekhak or kavi donon ke rup main, sookshm avlokan or teevr samvedansheeltaa ke madhyam se khoj karte hue prakritik vaataavaran ke srijan main nihit he
 Even the smallest thing does not miss his eyesight, he is also able to portray the vast landscape of his Wessex in sad or gentle pleasure
 
 In 1898 Hardy published his first poetry collection of poems, Wessex Poems, written over a period of more than 30 years
 hardi kaa daawa tha ki kavita unka pehla pyaar he or 1928 main apni mrityu tak vah sangrah prakashit karte rahe
 Although his contemporaries did not welcome his poems like novels, Hardy is now recognized as one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century
 unki kavitaaon kaa baad ke lekhakon par gaharaa prabhaav padaa, visheshkar philip larkin jisane 1973 main sampadit oxford book of taventingth centuri inglish vars ke sanskaran main hardi kii kai kavitaaon ko shaamil kiya
 In a recent biography of Hardy, Claire Tomlin argues that Hardy became a truly great English poet after the death of his first wife Emma, beginning with mourning songs in his memory, he wrote these poems Is described as "the finest and astonishing ritual of the dead in English poetry"
 unki adhikansh kavitaayen jaise "neutral tones" jivan or prem main niraashaa tathaa maanviya pidaa ke prati nirpekshata ke viruddh lambey samay se chale aa rahe maanavtaa ke sangharsh ke vishay main hai
 Some poems like "the Darkling Thrush" and "an August Midnight" are about poetic writing because the nature described in them inspires Hardy to write them
 aksar saadhaaran dikhte vishyon main pashchaatap kii hook sunai detii he
 His compositions range from a three-volume epic audiovisual The Dinestas to a variety of comedic poetry inspired by the makers of small and often optimistic or joyful ballads such as the almost unknown "the Children and Sir Nemales", Martins' Tombs, Athlhampton 
 vesex poems main vishesh rup se pramukh vishaywastu unnisvin sadi par nepolian ke yudhon kii lambii chaaya he udaahranarth, "da sargent sang" or "lepzig" main or jis tarah ve yaaden angreji paridrishy or iske nivaasiyon main vaas karti hai
 Some of Hardy's poems, such as "the Blinded Bird") show his love for the natural world and his firm stance against animal cruelty, which is also expressed by his antisemitic views and membership of the RSPCA
 jin sangeetkaaron ne hardi ke paathya ko sangeet diya he unamem shaamil hai gerald finzi, jisane hardi kii kavitaaon ke liye chah geet-chakra banaae hai, benjamin britain jiskaa geet-chakra winter vards hardi ke kavy par aadhaarit he, ralf won williams or gustav holst

 The setting for "the Darkling Thrush" by composer Lee Hoybey formed the basis of the multimedia opera Darkling, and Timothy Takach, a graduate of St
 Olaf, has also combined "the Darkling Thrush" for a four-part mixed vocalist

 The flow of ocean water in a continuous and directed direction is called ocean current
 vastutah mahasagariya dharaaen, mahasaagaron ke andar bahane vaali ushn yaa sheethal nadiyaan hai
 It is often mistaken that water in the oceans remains constant, but in reality it does not happen

 The major drainage stream and stream current are in the natural stream

 There are mainly three reasons for the formation of ocean currents - first, the amount of salt in the water changes from one place to another, so the density of ocean water also changes with the location
 dravyon kii prakritik pravriti jisamen ve adhik ghanatv vaale kshetra kii ore agrasar hote hai, ke kaaran dharaaen banati hai
 In the second reason, the rays of the sun do not fall on the surface of the water

 Knowledge of surface ocean currents can help control expenditure on shipping to a large extent

} Farmers in North America are called cowboys, traditionally horse-riding, and often perform a variety of other farm-related tasks

 Cowgirls, first defined as such at the end of the 19th century, have little documentary evidence of their historical role, but have established their ability to do exactly the same thing in the modern world and received considerable respect for their achievements
 vishwa ke anya anek bhaagon main bhi couboy yaa maweshiyon ke prabandhakarta hua karte hai, khaskar dakshin america or australia main, jo apane deshon main couboy jaise hi kaam kiya karte hai

 Continually practical cowboys were adapted to the modern world, then the tools and techniques of cowboys also had to be adapted to some extent, although many classic traditions are still preserved today

 It is derived from the word waka, meaning "cow", which comes from the Latin word wakka
 couboy ke liye ek anya angreji shabd he bakaaru, jo ki vakuero kaa hi angrejikaran he
 At least one linguist speculates that the word bakaru is derived from the Arabic language of the word bakra or bakhara, which also means "hyphener" or "heifer" and that the word may have entered Spanish during centuries of Islamic rule
 is
 multah, shabdic rup se is shabd kaa kaa arth ho saktaa he- "ek ladkaa jo gaayon kii dekhbhaal karata he
 "by 1849 it had developed into a modern sense as an adult shepherd or cattle steward of the American West

 The terms "cowhand" in 1852 and "cowpoke" appeared in 1881, which were originally used only for people transporting cattle in train coaches with a long sack for shipping
 Cowboys' names in American English include bakaru, cowpok, cowhand and cowpuncher

 The word cowboy has its roots in the English language rather than merely being translated into Spanish

 In the United States, some women also took care of cattle and learned the necessary skills, although the "cowgirl" was not widely recognized or acknowledged until the late 19th century
 aaj pashchimi pashu formon main aam taur par vayask couboy karyrat hai
 Responsibility for cattle or other cattle is no longer considered suitable for children or early adolescents
 However, both boys and girls, who grow up in an animal farm environment, often learn horse riding and begin to demonstrate the basic skills of the farm, usually under the supervision of adults, when physically competent

 The cowboy tradition begins in Spain, beginning with the Hacienda system of medieval Spain

 The climate of both the regions is dry, where there is less grass and hence large groups of cattle require vast land for adequate fodder

 Various aspects of the Spanish equestrian tradition can be seen as a mark of Arab rule in Spain, as well as the use of Eastern-type horses, characterized by a small stirrup La Geneta rider style, the use of strong lumbar gin and aids, Elements of the Moors, such as heavy nakel or hakamor, and other equipment and technology associated with horses are also included

 During the 16th century, Conquistadores and other Spanish colonies carried with them the tradition of rearing horses and other cattle in the Americas, beginning with what is now Mexico and Florida

 American cowboys were drawn from many sources
 From the late 1860s, after the American Civil War and the expansion of the cattle industry, former soldiers from both the Union and the Union of States moved west, demanding work, as a large number of impatient whites generally did

 a large number of Mexican and American Indians living in that area also worked as cowboys
 anek praarambhik vakuero indian the, jinhen spanish mishnon main maweshiyon kii dekhbhaal ke liye prashikshit kiya gaya tha
 Later, especially after 1890, when the American policy of "annexation" was formed with the Indian people, animal husbandry was also introduced in some Indian residential schools

 Since cowboys used to be lower in the social structure of that period, no firm figures on the actual proportions of different races are available

 Large numbers of cattle were kept in open spaces in semi-wooded areas and were left to graze most of the year, mostly without care
 kai maamalon main, vibhinn pashu farm maalik "sangh" bana liya karte or ek hi sthaan par apane maweshiyon ko charne ke liye chhod diya karte the
 To determine their ownership over animals, a specific brand would be marked on them, for this hot iron was used, usually when cattle were calves
 The primary cattle seen in the open range or location were clovehorns, which originated from the original Spanish loghorn imported in the 16th century; Although other breeds of cattle were also brought west in the late 19th century, they include meat-rich Hereford and were often cross-breeding with cloves

 a large number of horses were required for the cattle roundup
 Each cowboy required three to four fresh horses for a day's work
 The horses themselves used to get assembled
 It was common practice in the West that young calves born to domesticated mares were left "wild" in a semi-wild environment of open space
 vahaan "banaile" jhund bhi hua karte the, praayah jinhen mustangs naam se janaa jaataa he
 Both types were collected and developed and animals were made useful, a process known as horse breaking or "bronco-busted", usually done by cowboys who specialize in training horses
 In some cases, extremely cruel methods were used to tame horses and such animals were never fully reliable
 haalanki, anya couboy ne pashuon ke saath adhik maanviya dhang se bartaav karne kii jarurat mahasoos kii or apni ghoda prashikshan paddati main sudhaar kiya, aksar hi vakuero dwaara istemaal kii gayi takneekon ko phir se siikhaa gaya, khaskar californio parampara kii takneekon ko

 Prior to the mid-19th century, most animal farm owners primarily ran cattle for their own needs and sold surplus meat and hides locally
 vibhinn nirmaan prakriyaaon main khaal, sing, khur or vasa kaa bazaar bhi simit tha
 Nationally, before 1865, the demand for beef was also low

 From 1866, cattle could be sold in northern markets at a rate of $ 40 per head, making it potentially profitable to rearing cattle away from the market, especially from Texas
 pehali baar 1866 main maweshiyon ko bade paimaane par chicago ke liye potvahan ke makasad se texas se kareeb ke railway stesan le jane kaa prayaas kiya gaya; us samay anek pashu farm maalik sabase kareebi railway stesan, jo us samay cedalia, misuri main tha, tak apane maweshiyon ko le jane ke liye ekajute hue
 haalanki, purvi consas ke kisaan dare hue the ki laungorn se sthaneey maweshiyon ko maveshi fever ho ja saktaa he, saath hi fasalon ke ronde jane kaa bhi dar tha, is kaaran vahaan ke kisaanon ne samoohon kaa gathan kiya or chetavanee di ki unki jameen par paae jane vaale maveshi karmiyon ko peeta jayega yaa goli maar di jaayegi
 isliye, 1866 kaa yah abhiyaan railmarg tak pahunch paane main vifal rahaa or maweshiyon ke jhund kam keemat par bech die gayi
 However, in 1867, a cattle shipping facility was built to the west of Farm Country around the railway station in Abilene, Kansas, and the site became a hub for cattle shipping, with 36,000 head of cattle transported that year
 texas se abilene kaa wo rasta chisholm maarg se janaa jane laga, kyonki us raste ko jessi chisholm ne chihnit kiya tha
 It passed through present-day Oklahoma, which was then Indian territory
 haalanki, pashchim ke hollywood ke chitranon ke baavjood, desi americanyon ke saath apekshaakrit kam sangharsh the, jo aam taur par prati maveshi das saint ke path kar ke evaj main maweshiyon ke jhund ko jane kii anumati de diya karte the
 Later, other routes were built for various railway stations, including Dodge City and Wichita, Kansas
 1877 tak, doj city, consas jaise maveshi-potvahan ke bade shaharon se 500,000 maweshiyon kaa potvahan kiya ja chukaa tha
 In balancing cattle, it was necessary to maintain a balance between the speed of the cattle and their weight
 jabaki maweshiyon ko ek din main 25 mile tak haanka ja saktaa he, lekin isse unka vajan itnaa adhik kam ho jaataa ki manzil tak pahunchakar unhen bech paanaa mushkil ho jaataa
 aamtaur par unhen pratidin kam duuri tak le jaaya jaataa, unhen aaraam karne or dopaher tathaa raat main unhen charne diya jaataa
 ausatan, ek pashu samooh pratidin 15 mile chalakar apana swasth vajan banaaye rakh saktaa he
 This speed meant that it used to take two months to reach the railway station from the animal farm
 udhaaharan ke liye, chisholm maarg, 1,000 mile lanbaa tha
 On an average, there were about 3,000 cattle in a hank campaign of a herd of cattle
 At least 10 cowboys were needed to move the cattle to the herd, and one cowboy required three horses
 maweshiyon kii nigaraanee ke liye couboy 24 ghante paali main kaam kiya karte, din ke samay unhen sahi disha main le jane ke liye or raat main bhagdad or choron ko rokane ke liye
 The personnel also included a cook, who drove a feeding vehicle, usually a bullock and an horseman, with Remuda or additional horses
 At the time of the cattle drive, Ashwapala was often a very young cowboy or of low social status, but the cook would have been a highly respected member of the crew, who was not only in charge of the food, but also had medical supplies
 She used to have improper knowledge of experimental medicine
 1880 ke dashak tak, maveshi udyog ke vistaar ke kaaran atirikt khule sthanon yaa hadon kii jarurat mahasoos kii jane lagi
 Many animal farm owners then expanded to the northwest, where even then the undeveloped large grasslands existed
 texas ke maveshi uttar kii ore rocky mountain west or dakota main chale gayi
 Cowboys adapted themselves to the cold conditions and the westward industry intertwined itself with many regional traditions from California to Texas, often incorporating the most useful elements of each
 1880 ke dashak main shuru hue kantedaar taar maweshiyon ko ek kshetra vishesh main hi roke rakhte the, taaki maveshi us ilaake main seemaa se adhik char na len
 texas or aasapaas ke kshetron main, jansankhya vruddhi ke kaaran pashu farm maalikon ko apni-apni bhoomi ko gher lene kii jarurat mahasoos hui
 In the north, over-the-limit variability in the open area would have led to a lack of fodder for cattle in the winter, leading to starvation, especially during the dreaded winter of 1886–1887, when millions of cattle died in the northwest , Causing the collapse of the cattle industry
 1890 ke dashak tak, uttari samtal kshetron main bhi kantedaar taar kii baad maanak ban gayi, adhikansh raashtra ko samavisht karne ke liye railmarg kaa vistaar hua or bade pashu farm kshetron ke kareeb maance packing plant banaae gayi, isse texas se consas ke railway steshnon tak maweshiyon ko laane kaa lanbaa haank abhiyaan anaavashyak ho gaya
 Because of this, the open area came to an end and large cattle herd campaigns came to an end
 Small hank expeditions of cattle continued until at least the 1940s, as farm owners still needed to herd cattle to local railway stations for transportation to stockyards and packing plants, before modern cattle trucks were built

 Over time, the cowboys of the American West developed their own personal culture, an amalgam of frontier and Victorian values that also retained remnants of heroism
 pruthak paristhitiyon main is tarah ke khatarnaak kaam ne aatm-nirbharta or vyaktvaad kii parampara kaa bhi nirmaan kiya, vyaktigat eemaandaaree par khaasaa jor diya gaya, geet or kavita ke drushtaant prastut kiye gayi
 However, some men went to the frontier because they were attracted to men
 In an area where the number of men outnumbered that of women, even in the social events where people of both genders participated, only men were filled and there were men dancing for each other
 Had to make a partner
 Homosexual relationships were established between young and unmarried men, but cowboy culture itself remained deeply homophobic
 haalanki puraane pashchim main samalangikta-virdohi kaanoon aam the, lekin aksar unhen chaynaatmak rup se hi lagu kiya jaataa tha
 In the late 19th and early 20th century, the development of the Wild West show further emboldened the cowboy traditions, working in the minds of the common people, which showcased and thrilled the lives of cowboys and homegrown Americans
 1920 ke dashak se shuru karke aaj tak pashchimi filmon ne couboy jivan style ko lokapriy banaaya, lekin saath hi saath sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak donon hi rup main nirantar purvaagrah kaa bhi nirmaan kiya
 In some cases, cowboys and violent killers are often paired with each other

 Similarly, cowboys are often shown fighting in films with American Indians

 Actually, those working in the animal farm, past or present, have very little time to do any other work, they just have to work hard to keep the farm organized

 However, institutions such as the National Cowgirl Museum and the Hall of Fame have made significant efforts in recent years in collecting women's contributions and preparing their documents
 aise kuch record uplabdh hai jinamein old west ke maveshi margon tak mahilaon dwaara maweshiyon ko haankane ke ullekh milte hai
 However, women have done considerable work in animal farms and in some cases even run them
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki mahilaon, khaskar un chote formon ke maalikon kii patniyon or betiyon ne purushon ke kandhe se kandhaa milakar kaam kiya he, jo badi taadaad main bahari majdoor nahin rakh sakate the; or isiilie unhen ghudsawaari or sambandhit kaary puure karne kii kaabiliyat kii jarurat padati

 Early photographers such as Evelyn Cameron documented the lives of women and cowgirls working in animal farms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries

 It was only after the arrival of the Wild West show that "cowgirls" came to the fore

 By 1900, split-split skirts for riding became popular, and women were allowed to wear men's clothing or, worse, trousers without condemning Victorian-era audiences for competing with men
 20veen sadi ke prarambh ke samay se filmon main, cougirl ne lokapriy samskruti main apni bhoomika kaa vistaar kiya or film dizinron ne paashchaatya jeenon par sawari ke upyukt aakarshak kapadon kaa vikaas kiya
 Independently of the entertainment industry, the development of rodeos exposed another type of cowgirl - rodeo cowgirl
 In the early Wild West shows and rodeos, women started participating in all the competition, sometimes against other women or sometimes with men
 Cowgirls like Fannie Sperry Steele rode in "rough stock" like men and took the same risks and also competed in big rodeo competitions such as the Calgary Stampede and Cheyenne Frontier Days
 1925 ke baad mahilaon ke liye rodio pratiyogita badal gayi, jab purvi promotaron ne medisson squaire garden jaisi jagahon main indoor rodio rakhni shuru kii
 Women were generally eliminated from the men's competition and many of the women's competitions were reduced

 Boys and girls are much more eager to compete among themselves in high school rodeo and o-mok-si competition, where boys can also be seen competing in "women's" events such as barrel racing
 rodio vishwa ke baahar, olympic sahit lagbhag sabhi ghudsawaari pratispardhaon main purushon ke samaan hi bhaag liya karti hai or kating, lagaam lagane or dhairya jaisi paashchaatya sawari main bhi hissaa le sakati hai
 Today's working cowgirls generally use men-like clothing, tools, and materials, although they generally prefer different colors and designs to look attractive in competition
