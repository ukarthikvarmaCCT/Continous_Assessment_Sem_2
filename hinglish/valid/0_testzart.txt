 Manshali sanchika sthanantaran protocol ek network protocol hota he jiske dwaara internet aadhaarit tisipi / ypi network par sanchikaon kaa aadan-pradaan kiya jaataa he
 This is used by user based code or anonymous user access
 ab lagbhag har santhaan main apatpi sarwar hone se, yah vyavastha kaam main nahin aati he
 Many recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers
 isse dur-daraaj se aane vaali sanchikaon par local filon jaisaa hi kaary ho saktaa he
 FTP URL is used in this
 sanchika bhejne ke anya tareeke jaise esaftipi or esasipi apatpi se nahin jude hote
 SSH is used throughout their process
 file transfar protocol yaa apatpi apane vartmaan rup main vibhinn charnon se hota hua pahunchaa he
 It was first formulated as RFC 114 on 16 April 1971 which was later replaced with RFC 765 in June 1980 which was converted from RFC 959 in October 1985
 uske baad anek suraksha sambandhi badlaav isamen aae
 These security changes were brought about because initially this method of sending files was very insecure
 is asuraksha kaa pramukh kaaran tha ki sanchika bhejne kii prakriya main koi bhi usee network par us file ko chura yaa nakal kar saktaa tha
 Prior to HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet, this was a common problem faced by Internet protocols
 is samasya kaa nivaaran esaftipi ke dwaara hi sambhav hua
 FTP can be operated in active mode, passive mode and extended passive mode
 refsi 2428 dwaara sitambar 1998 main, vistrut niskriy mod joda gaya tha
 When transferring data over the network, multiple data representations can be made
 do sarvaadhik saamaanya antaran mod hai: FTP server return codes indicate their status by their inner digits
 mul afatipi vinirdesan, sanchikaon ke antaran kii swaabhaavik asurakshit paddati he, kyonki ancrypted dhang se data antarit karne kii koi nirdisht vidhi nahin he
 This means that under most network configurations, usernames, passwords, FTP commands and transferred files can use any packet detector located on the same network using a packet detector
 yah achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet jaise esasail ke nirmaan se pehle likhe gaye kai internet protocol vinirdeshon ke liye aam samasya rahi he
 The common solution for this problem is SFTP, or FTPS, which adds SSL or TLS encryption to FTP in the manner specified in RFC 4217
 afatipi seva pradaan karne vaala ek host, atirikt rup se anaam afatipi pahunch uplabdh karaane main sakasham hota he
 When asked for a username, users normally log in to an 'anonymous' account service
 yadhyapi aam taur par prayoktaaon ko password ke evaj main apana i-mail pataa bhejne ke liye kaha jaataa he, to aapurit jaankaree kaa satyaapan thodaa-bahut yaa bilkul nahin kiya jaataa he
 Since modern FTP clients typically hide the anonymous login process from the user, FTP clients can supply fake data as passwords because the application may not know the user's email address
 gofar protocol ko or saath hi saadhaaran fil antaran protocol or fil seva protocol ko bhi, anaam afatipi ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main sujhaayaa gaya he
 Where FTP access is not in use, remote or remote FTP or FTP mail is used
 isamen ek email duusare apatpi sarwar par bheja jaataa he jo apatpi cmand puri karata he or downlod sanchika vaali anulgnak waapas bhejtaa he
 This is especially used where FTP access is restricted
 doorvarti afatipi sarwar ko nishpadit kiye jane vaale afatipi cmand yukt i-mail bheja jaataa he
 It is a mail server that parses incoming e-mail, executes FTP commands and sends back e-mails with a file downloaded as an attachment
 yah spasht rup se ek afatipi client se kam lacheela he, kyonki nirdeshikaon ko parsparik kriya karte yaa adeshon ko sanshodhit karte hue nahin dekha ja saktaa he or uttar main bade sanchika anulagnkon ko mail sarwar ke madhyam se nikalne main bhi samasya ho sakati he
 These days most Internet users have easy access to FTP, so this process is not popular in day-to-day use
 vartmaan main aadhunik or haal hi ke web brouzar or file prabandhak, afatipi sarvaron se jud sakate hai, haalanki unamem apatpies jaise protocol vistaar ke liye samarthan kii kami ho sakati he
 This allows the interface, such as the interface used for local files, to be used to switch remote files over FTP
 yah ek afatipi yuarel ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It occurs as: vaikalpik rup se yuarel main password diya ja saktaa he, udaa
: Most web browsers require passive mode FTP, which not all FTP servers are capable of accomplishing
 kuch brouzar keval sanchikaon ko downlod karne kii anumati dete hai, par sarwar main sanchikaon ko aplod karne kaa koi saadhan uplabdh nahin karaate hai
 Representation of port numbers on IP addresses and port commands and PASV reply is another challenge for network address translation tools in dealing with FTP
 eneti upkaran dwaara in maanon ko badalanaa padataa he, taaki ve nat-ed client ke ai-pi pate or data conection ke liye NAT upkaran dwaara chune gaye port ko shaamil karen
 The new address and port may differ from their original address and port in the length of their decimal representation
 iskaa arth yah he ki NAT upkaran dwaara sabhi parvarti packeton ke liye tisipi anukram or pavati fildon ko badalte hue, niyantran conection par maan ko saavdhaanee se badla janaa chahie
 Such translations are not typically performed in most NAT devices, but special application-level gate-ways are available for this purpose
 SSH kii apeksha afatipi ek esaech conection kii apeksha saamaanya afatipi satr ketnal banane ke prayog ko sanderbhit karata he
 FTP uses more than one TCP connection, so tunneling over SSH is particularly difficult
 kai esaech clienton ke saath, niyantran channel ke liye tunnel taiyaar karne kaa prayaas keval channel kii raksha karegaa; jab data sthanantarit hota he, donon chor par afatipi software tisipi conekshnon ko sthapit karenge, jo esaech conection se baahar upmarg par guzarenge or is tarah gopneeyata, akhandta sangrakshan, aadi nahin rahegi
 Otherwise, SSH client software requires specific knowledge of the FTP protocol and monitoring and rewriting FTP control messages and autonomously opening new forwarding for FTP data channels
 esaech sanchaar suraksha ke software parikr kaa sanskaran 3 or jeepiel dwaara licensokrut echoensi, aise do software package hai, jo is vidha kaa samarthan karte hai
 FTP over SSH is sometimes referred to as secure FTP; It should not be considered another method of securing FTP like SSL / TLS
 SSH kaa upyog karte hue sanchikaon ko sthanantarit karne ke anya tareeqon main shaamil hai esafatipi or esasipi, jo afatipi se sambandhit nahin hai; inamen se prayek main, puraa vaartalap hameshaa SSH protocol dwaara surakshit he

 Some authors have described its expansion by the name Brajbhasha

 Mirza Khan, the author of 'tuhfatul Hind', mentions the area of brajbhasha as "the language spoken in Braj and its neighborhood

 Brajbhasha is spoken as far as Agra in the south, Bharatpur, Dhaulpur and Karauli

 Intuitive areas include Agra, Etah, Mainpuri, Farrukhabad and Etawah districts, but the languages of Etawah and Farrukhabad are Kannauji according to them, the rest is Braj-speaking
 ' Kellag has written that Brajbhasha is spoken in the entire Upper Doab and the valleys of ganga-yamuna, to the northeast of the Rajputana dialects

 Since Grierson Sahib's view is not valid to the author that Kannauji is an independent dialect, the districts of Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur, Farrukhabad, Hardoi, Etawah and Kanpur of Uttar Pradesh have also been included in the Braj Bhasha region

 Poetry was composed in it for many centuries

 This was predicted by Acharya Bhikhari Das, the poet of Reetikal
 unhone spasht kaha ki brajabhasha kaa parichay braj se baahar rahane vaale kaviyon se bhi mil saktaa he
 It should not be understood that Brajbhasha is sweet-beautiful
 iske saath sanskrit or farsi hi nahin, anya bhashaaon kaa bhi put rahata he
 Yet the peculiarity of the Brajbhasha style remains to be seen
 isse yah bhi siddh hota he ki brajabhasha style anek bhashaaon se samanvit thi
 In fact, by the middle of the 16th century, the mixed style of Braj Bhasha had become the poetry language of the whole of Madhya Pradesh
 vistaar main bhakthi andolan kaa bhi haath rahaa

 There are many talented poets of Braj Bhasha in Bhojpuri, Magahi and Maithili language areas in Bihar
 purv main bengal ke kaviyon ne bhi brajabhasha main kavita likhi
 ' pashchim main rajasthan to brajabhasha shaileyon kaa prayog prachur maatra main karata hi rahaa 1 or bhi pashchim main gujarat or kuccha tak brajabhasha style samaadrut thi
 Maharao Lakhpat of Kutch was a great scholar
 brajabhasha ke prachaar or prashikshan ke liye inhone ek vidhyalay bhi kholaa tha
 In this way, the spread of Brajbhasha in the medieval period was not only in Braj and its surrounding areas, but also in the previous regions
 bengal, maharashtra, gujarat, kathiyawad evam kuccha aadi main bhi brajabhasha kii rachanaayen hui
 There were two situations of expansion of Braj Bhasha style
 pratham sthiti bhashaa vaigyanik itihaas ke kram se utpann hui
 When Western or Madhya Pradesh language started violating its geographical boundaries due to many reasons, then it started taking the form of a distinct language style, coordinated with the local forms
 jin kshetron main yah kathy bhashaa na hokar keval sahitya main prayukt kritrim, mishrit or vishisht rup main dhal gai or vishisht avasaron, sandarbhon yaa kavy rupon main rudh ho gai, un kshetron ko style kshetra mana jayega
 Genre-area grows with the help of pre-language expansion or genre extension
 pashchimi yaa madhyadeshi apbhransh ke uttarkalin rupon kii vistruti isi prakaar hui
 The second situation was present when the regional expansion of the language-style of the pre-tradition formed the background and the historical and objective reasons for the expansion of the stylistic region also became present

 There are very few astronomers who do both because different fields require different proficiency, but most professional astronomers find themselves on one of the two sides
 khagoliki brahmad main avasthit akashiya pindon kaa prakaash, udbhav, sanrachana or unke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan khagoliki kaa vishay he
 So far, the entire part of the universe has been revealed, there are estimated to be about 19 billion sky Ganges and there are about 10 billion stars in each sky Ganges
 akaash ganga kaa vyas lagbhag ek lakh prakashavarsh he
 The primitive organism was born on our earth 2 billion years ago and man's incarnation on earth happened 10-20 million years ago
 vaigyanikon ke anusaar is brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he
 The Sun is an average star with nine main planets, Earth being one of them
 is brahmad main har ek tara surya sadrush he
 There are many stars in front of which their sun does not even equal to a molecule
 jaise surya ke grah hai or un sabko milakar ham saura parivaar ke naam se pukaarte hai, usee prakaar harek taare kaa apana apana parivaar he
 Many people think that the Sun is stable, but the entire solar family is also moving at a speed of 13 miles per second under the local constellation system
 sthaneey nakshatra pranali akaash ganga ke antargat prati second 200 mile kii gati se chal rahi he or sampurna akaash ganga duurastha bahya jyortimalaon ke antargat prati second 100 mile kii gati se vibhinn dishaao main gum rahi he

 But just before dawn, it flows from northeast to west and south

 The distance between wires adjacent to each other can be billions of miles
 jab sate hue taron kaa yah haal he to dur dur sthit taron ke bich kii duuri aisi gananaatit he jise kah paanaa mushkil he
 For this reason, long distances between stars and other light years are measured
 ek prakashavarsh vah duuri he jo duuri prakaash ek lakh chhiyaasi hajaar mile prati second kii gati se ek varsh main tay karata he
 For example, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 125 million miles, light travels this distance in a quarter to eight minutes
 at: prithvi se surya kii duuri sava aath prakaash minute hui
 The distance from the stars through which light comes in eight thousand years, we have measured a quarter to twenty-four padma mi
 lekin taare to itani itani duuri par hai ki unase prakaash ke aane main lakhon, karodon, arabon varsh lag jaataa he
 In this situation we will not be able to express these distances in miles and neither will we understand anything
 isiilie prakashavarsh kii ikai kaa vaigyanikon ne prayog kiya he
 Suppose there is nothing very far after any other constellations of the universe, etc
, but this thing cannot be final
 yadi uske baad kuch he to turant yah prashn saamne aa jaataa he ki vah kuch kahan tak he or uske baad kya he? isiilie hamane is brahmad ko anadi or anant mana
 Apart from this, it is not possible to express the vastness, generality of the universe in other words

 These are called star clusters or gluteular stars ie Tara Clusters

 Due to modern discoveries, as the capacity of binoculars increases, the range of this visible region of the universe increases
 parantu vartmaan paridrishy main brahmad kii puri thaah maanav kshamta se bahut dur he
 The modern era of astrophysics began with the German physicist Kirchak
 surya ke vaataavaran main sodium, louh, magnesium, calcium tathaa anek anya tatwon kaa unhone pataa lagaaya 
 In our country, the late Professor Meghnad Saha has done important work in the study of physical elements of the Sun and stars
 unhone varnakramon ke adhyayan se khagoleey pindon ke vaataavaran main atyant mahatvapurn khojein kii hai
 Nowadays, two eminent scientists of our country, Dr
 S
 Chandrasekhar and Dr
 Jayant Vishnu Narlikar are also involved in solving the mysteries of the universe
 bahut pehle koparnicus, tiko brahe or mukhyat: capler ne khagol vidya main mahatvaparnu kaary kiya tha
 The three laws that Kepler has proposed in relation to the motion of planets remain the cornerstone of astrophysics
 khagol vidya main newton kaa kaary bahut mahatvapurn rahaa he
 In the field of cosmology, some important things have come up due to the discoveries of the last few years
 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth
 mount polomer vedhashala main sthit 200 inch vyasavaale lens kii doorabeen se khagol shastriyon ne akaash gangaaon ke dur hatane kii prakriya ko dekha he
 When we look at the universe with a telescope, we feel that we are the center of this universe and other things are running away from us
 yadi anya akaash gangaaon main prekshak bheje jaaen to ve bhi yahi paaenge ki is brahmad ke centre bindu hai, baaki akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary
 yah vah samay tha jab ki ainstin kaa saapekshavaad kaa siddhant apni shaishvavastha main tha
 However, Einstein's theory was more successful than Newton's theories in interpreting findings based on solar system observations
 newton ke anusaar do pindon ke bich kii guru tvkarshan shakti ek duusare par tatkaal prabhaav daalati he lekin ainstin ne yah sabit kar diya ki parsparik guru tvkarshan kii shakti kii gati prakaash kii gati ke samaan teevr nahin ho sakati he
 After all, here Einstein misinformed Newton's letter
 logon ko ainstin kaa hi siddhant pasand aayaa
 Three concepts of the origin of the universe are presented xxrep 4 - 1
 sthir avasthaa kaa siddhant 2
 Explosion Theory and 3
 dolan siddhant
 The second assumption is more important in these assumptions
 is dharna ke anusaar brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he or isi kaaran akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi he
 If you put the inverted picture of this universe in front of you, then you will see the universe becoming disheveled, and the sky will appear as if the Ganges is not running
 at: kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kisi samay koi mahapind rahaa hoga or usee ke visphot hone ke kaaran akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Explosion theory is also confirmed by the discovery of new wires called quasars and pulsars

 a partial or complete solid-solution of two or more metallic elements is called a mishratu or alloy
 ispaat ek mishra dhaatu he
 Often the properties of alloys differ from the properties of the components that make up that alloy
 ispaat, lohe kii apeksha adhik majboot hota he
 Mishratu is bronze, brass, stitch etc
 mishradhatu vyapak rup main ek aisa shabd he jiskaa prayog kisi bhi dhatvik vastu ke liye hota he, basharte vah rasinic tatv na ho
 The art of alloying is very ancient
 satya to yah he ki kaanse kaa mahatv ek yug main itnaa adhik tha ki maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas ke us yug kaa naam hi 'kaansya yug' pad gaya he
 Although pure metals have many useful properties, such as the conductivity of heat and electricity, pure metals are not commonly used in mechanical and manufacturing operations, because they do not have the necessary strength
 dhaatu ko adhik majboot banane kii sabase mahatvapurn vidhi dhaatumishran he
 a lot of effort was made in this direction in the 19th century, the result of this is that more than five thousand alloys are available for many useful works today and new innovations are being done constantly to prepare new alloys
 aaj kisi vishesh upyog ke liye icchit gunonvali mishradhatuen banaai jaati he
 When metals dissolve in a common solution, such as an acid, they give off their metallic properties and normally form salts, but when melted they dissolve along with their metallic properties
 dhaatuon ke aise thos vilyan ko mishradhatu kehete hai
 Non-metals are also small in many alloys, but the quality of the whole remains metallic
 at: 1939 i0 main america vastu pareekshak parishad ne mishradhatu kii nimnlikhit paribhaasha kii- Initially, the alloy was used most for making coins and ornaments
 taanbe ke sikkon main tanba, tin or jasta kramash: 95 / 4 tathaa 1 pratishat rahete hai
 Until 1920, silver coins in England were made of 'sterling' silver, with silver and copper being 92
5 and 7
5 percent respectively
 america main chaandi ke sabhi sikkon main chaandi or tanba kramash: 90 tathaa 10 pratishat hote hai
 Gold and copper in England's gold coins are 91
67 and 8
33 percent respectively, and gold coins in the United States are 90 percent gold and other metals, especially copper
 platinayam, sona tathaa chaandi ke aabhushanon ke rango main sundarataa laane ke liye unako kathor, majboot tathaa tikaoo banane ke liye, yaa unhen saste mulyon main vikray ke liye duusari dhaatuon ke saath milakar kaam main laate hai
 Determining whether alloys are simple mixtures or chemical compounds is a complex problem
 kuch arthon main ye rasinic yogic hai, kyonki jab sodium saras banaaya jaataa he, tab sodium ke har ek tukade ko paar main daalane se prakaash kii teevr jwaala nikalati he or paara garam ho jaataa he, yah yogic banane kaa lakshan he
 Similarly, when a piece of aluminum metal is added to the melting gold, so much heat is generated that the entire molten metal becomes brighter
 anek mishra dhaatuon kaa rang apane avyav dhaatuon ke rangon se bilkul bhinn hota he
 For example, both silver and zinc are white, but the alloy they make is very beautiful pink
 sona pilaa or aluminium shwet hota he, kintu inaki mishradhatu kaa rang ati chamkila nillohit hota he
 This property also has compounds
 mishradhaatuon ke galnaank nikaalane par gyaat hua he ki mishra dhaatuon kaa vyavhaar do prakaar kaa he: kuch mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank jaise jaise kisi avyav dhaatu kii maatra badalati hai vaise-vaise badalata he, yah mishran kaa gun he or kuch mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank ek sthir taap hota he, jo prakat karata he ki mishradhatuen yogic hai
 The physical and chemical properties of alloys differ from the properties of their constituent metals, and the properties of alloys are by no means comparable to the properties of element metals
 yah bhinnata is kaaran se he ki jab dhaatuon ko ek saath pighalaate hai, tab ve kitne hi antaradhaatuk yogic tathaa thos vilyan banaati hai
 The density of an alloy can be less or greater than the mean density of its constituent metals
 kuch mishradhaatuon kaa rang apni avyav dhaatuon ke rangon se bilkul hi bhinn hota he
 They are harder than their constituent metals, but less flexible and malleable and more brittle
 mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank sarvada adhiktam taap par pighalanevaali avyavdhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 And usually at a minimum temperature the melting element is less than the melting point of the metal
 udaahranarth, ek mishradhatu, jisamen sisa, tin, bismuth tathaa cadmium hai, 75 ̊sein0 par galati he, jab ki nunatam taap par pighalane vaali avyav-dhaatu, tin kaa galnaank 232 ̊ sein0 he
 All these are the properties due to which alloys become more valuable than pure metals and prove more useful in industry
 upar varnit falon dwaara tathaa sookshmdarshi, eks-kiran varnakram maapi, ooshmiya tathaa rasinic vishleshan or duusare bhautik pareekshanon dwaara mishradhaaton ke sanghathan tathaa crystalia rachana ke vistrut adhyayan ke parinamswaroop, mishradhaatuon ko teen shreniyon main rakhaa gaya he
 This division has been done on the basis of how the group of atoms of the constituent metals in the alloys is organized
 ye teen shreniyan nimnlikhit hai: In these types of alloys, when the element metals are molten, they dissolve in each other, but when solid, the crystals of the metals break apart, that is, the metals are insoluble
 is prakaar mishradhatu prayek avyav dhaatu ke shuddh crystal kaa mishran hoti he or thanda karne par koi ek avyav dhaatu thos rup main pruthak ho jaati he
 For example, a liquid alloy consisting of only 10 parts lead and 90 parts tin, when cooled, pure tin crystals are first separated in the same way as pure ice crystals cooled from a dilute solution of sugar
 Are separate jis taap par tin ke crystal pruthak hona prarambh karte he, vah taap shuddh tin ke galnaank se kam hota he
 When the melting point of the tin is dissolved in the lead, the molecular weight of the lead is determined by the same rule by which the molecules of the dissolved substances in the water are removed
 is vidhi se un kai dhaatuon kaa anubhaar nikaala gaya he, jo tanughatvik vilyan main alag parmaanu ke rup main rahati he
 Lead-antimony alloys belong to the mixture category
 antimony bhangur hota he or sisa mulaayam
 The printing metal is a alloy of CC, antimony and a very small amount of tin
 is mishradhatu main antimony kii kathorta to hoti he, kintu yah uski tarah bhangur nahin hoti
 In this type of alloys, the atoms of one element metal fit well in the crystalline structure of the other element metal
 thos vilyan shrenee kii mishradhatuen do bhinn prakaar kii hoti he: Many copper-nickel alloys that have significant use fall under the category of solid solutions
 udaahranarth, ve mishradhatuen jinase nikal ke sikke, rifl kii goliyon kii tapiyaan or ek taar jiskaa vaidyut pratirodh adhik hota he, banataa he
 Many of the Canadian minerals contain copper and nickel sulfides, which are smelted to form an alloy

 This alloy is called monel metal
 yah adhik tanya, lacheelee tathaa sanksharan pratirohak hoti he
 Generally, metals do not form compounds by mixing with each other, but by heat analysis it has been found that metals combine with each other to form a large number of compounds
 in yogicon kaa vargeey naam antaradhaatuk yogic he
 Most compounds of this type form alkali and alkaline clay metals, by combining them with the metals of the odd subclass of the periodic table
 in yogicon main dhaatuen kis maatra main mili hui hai, isko rasinic sutron dwaara darshaate hai
 It is known from the study of these formulas that these types of compounds violate all the laws of valency that are formed by the compounds formed by the combination of metals and non-metals
 udaahranarth, sodium, tin or sisa ke saath rasinic kriya kar nimnlikhit yogic banaata he : Many interstitial compounds are very stable and do not dissolve their constituents in metals even when heated to temperatures higher than their melting point
 ye yogic taral ammonia main ghulte hai or is prakaar se jo vilyan taiyaar hota he, vah vaidyut chaalak hota he
 When they are electrically decomposed, one component metal, which is less positive than the other, accumulates on the positive and the other on the minuscule

 pratidipti kii tivrata kaa anumaan karke eksre kii tivrata kii tulana sthool rup se ho sakati he
 In the second method, the action of X-ray above the photo palette is used
 eksre ke aapatan se photo pattica par jo kaalaapan aata he, vah eksre kii tivrata tathaa aapatan kaal par nirbhar rahata he
 This method allows the action of an X-ray of greater intensity to take place at the appropriate place on a photo plate with a higher intensity of the X-ray beam, and then the action of the second X-ray beam on the same plaque down t, 2t
 , 3t etc
 pattica ko viksit karne ke pashchaat donon chitron ke kaalepan kii tulana karne se donon punjon kii saapeksh tivrata kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 The third method of intensity measurement is more prevalent, because intensity can be measured precisely in this manner
 jab eksre vaayu main se jaati he tab vaayu vidyucchalak ho jaati he or uski chaalakata eksre kii tivrata par nirbhar rahati he
 The electrons of air molecules are displaced by the action of X-rays and ions are produced
 uchit vidyudvibhav kii upasthiti main yanon se jo vidyuddhara praapt hoti he, vah samvedi vidyunmapi se, athwa anya uchit samvedi upkarnon se, maapi ja sakati he
 The intensity of the x-ray is proportional to the electrode
 haal main gunak-prakashanalika or eksre-samvedi sphur ke upyog se tivrata kaa maapan atyant sulabh ho gaya he
 Similarly, the stream of ionization can also be easily measured with the help of a gelatinizer
 at: vartmaankaal main in donon prakaar ke upkarnon dwaara eksre kii tivrata kaa maapan adhik prachlit he
 These three popular methods of intensity measurement can only compare the intensities of the two x-ray elements, the absolute intensity cannot be achieved
 apati eksre ke lambavat ek varg centimetre kshetrafal par prati senkad jo urja padati he, usko vastut: ham us eksre kii tivrata kah sakate hai
 This intensity is expressed in ergs per square centimeter per second
 tivrata kaa maapan urja ke rup main karne ke liye eksre kii urja ko ushma atyant alp hone ke kaaran is reeti se tivrathamapan ke liye atyant sookshmagrahi vishisht upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In this manner, Terrill made the first attempt to intensify
 iske pashchaat 1953 i
 main america main ilinay vishvavidhyalay ke henderson, beati evam laafan ne bhi praytn kiye
 The intensity of the x-ray generated by very high current can only be measured in this way
 bhautikee ke praayogic kaaryo main sadaa ekakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or maapi gai raashi ke anusaar iskaa swaroop hota he
 The unit of X-ray quantity is called 'rantzen' and in the present tense the definition of a Rantzen is as follows- eksre kaa doosraa vishesh gundharm unki thos padaartho main praveshkshmata he
 The decrease in the intensity of the X-ray is not the same when the different solids are passed through the same mass
 kuch thos padaartho main eksre kaa avasorana adhik hota he ore kuch padaartho main kam
 The result of this experiment is that if the x-ray crosses the different mots of a particular solid, then the output x-ray is related to the intensity, initial intensity and thickness of the solid according to the following equation: log = – m × motaai --- Here = initial intensity of x-ray; i = thos padaarth main se paar hone ke pashchaat eksre kii tivrata; m = a constant, called the absorption multiplier
 is sthiraank ko us thos vishesh eksre-avasorana-gunak kehete hai
 In fact it is a linear multiplier
 isko vyapak rup main vyakt karne ke liye main us thos padaarth ke ghanatv kaa bhaag diya jaataa he or is prakaar praapt avasorana gunank ko 'sanhati-avasorana-gunank' kehete hai
 Therefore mmass = m / ghanatv The special significance of the Samhita-absorption-multiplier is that it is the characteristic property of the absorbing material
 udaahranarth, jal or bhaap kaa rekhiy avasorana-gunak bhinn hota he, kyonki jal drav he or bhaap gas hai
 But the x-ray code-absorption-coefficient of water and steam is the same, because the chemical preservatives of water and steam are integral, namely, hydrogen and oxygen
 prakaash or eksre ke gundharmo kii bhinnata sanhati-avasorana-gunak se atyant spasht ho jaati he
 Generally, liquids and solids are themselves opaque or translucent to light
 prakaash ke liye hira paardarshee or graphite apaardarshee he, parantu eksre kaa sanhati-avasorana-gunank hira tathaa graphite ke liye samaan hi rahata he, kyonki ye donon padaarth vastut: carbon ke hi vibhinn swaroop hai
 Absorption coefficients of the entire X-rays from the X-ray tube are mainly dependent on both the electrical current and the atomic number of the metal of the absorber screen
 jaise jaise vibhav badhata jaataa he vaise hi vaise utpaadit eksre kii praveshkshmata athwa kathorta badhati jaati he
 The equation leads to the conclusion that the absorption multiplier for a single solid will be constant for all the masses
 kintu pratyaksh prayog main eksre nalika se praapt vikiran kaa nune praveshkshamtawala bhaag avasorak parade ke pratham staron main hi purnataya avashoshit ho jaataa he 
 Only X-rays of high penetrability reach the final levels of the absorption screen
 spasht he ki avasorana parade main pravesh karanevaale eksre kaa avasorana gunank parade se paar nikle hue eksre ke avasorana gunak se adhik hota he
 When the absorption multiplier of all x-rays is the same, then they are called homogeneous x-rays
 at: eksre kii maatra unki tivrata se or unki visheshta unke avasorana-gunak se maapit hota he
 We can see the matter from which light comes, because light rays have an action on the design of our eye
 is prakaar kii kriya eksre dwaara nahin hoti, at: eksre drishy nahin hai
 Not only this, the action of each other on the eyes and other parts of the body is very harmful
 jivit koshaaon par eksre kii paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se ve mritt ho jaati hai
 X-rays easily cross through the skin and they are likely to die due to their long-term action on the living cells within
 phir, eksre ke prabhaav tikaoo hote he; at: sharir ke ek hi sthaan par bhinn-bhinn samayon par bhi eksre kii kriya hoti rahane par kuch kaal main cancer sadrush du:saadhy rog ho jate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to work very carefully while using X-ray
 sharir kii raksha ke liye vishesh saadhan upyog main laae jate hai
 In addition, current x-ray users keep an x-ray-measure in their pocket in the present tense, which shows how much radiation has worked on the employee
 eksre ke is ghaatak gundharm kaa anya rogon main upyog bhi kiya jaataa he; jaise, sharir ke kisi bhaag main anisht roganuon kii vruddhi hoti ho to unpar eksre kaa prayog karke unhen nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 X-rays are used more in medicine, especially in surgery
 is prakaar ke upyog kii sambhaavna eksre ke avishkaar ke samay se hi spasht thi
 Different elements of the body have different absorption-multipliers; Therefore, by taking an x-ray from any part of the body and taking a photo, the bones and other components are seen separately
 at: shalya kriya ke purv, athwa yah gyaat karne ke liye ki rog kis avasthaa main he eksre photo atyant upyogi hote hai
 As the production of X-rays progressed, they started to be used in industries as well, and in the present times the use of X-rays in metallurgy has become necessary
 urja yaa to kanon ke saath athwa tarangon ke saath sanyukt rahati he
 If energy is emitted from an origin, the existence of this energy is usually expressed in the intensity of electromagnetic waves, or as the kinetic energy of particles like electrons, protons, neutrons, ions etc
 tarang or kan ke swaroop bhinn hote hai; isliye inako saadhaarant: bhinn virgo main rakhaa jaataa he
 But it has become clear from the results of many experiments that the bonding of these classes has properties of particles in waves and, conversely, particles also have properties of waves
 is dwait rup kaa prarambh plank ke ushmavikiran ke siddhant se prarambh hua
 The properties of X-rays are also no exception to this dual form

 Some of the experiments by which the x-ray waveform is proved are given below- eksre se manibh sanrachana jaanane main vishesh sahaayta milti he 
 Apart from medical uses, X-rays are also used in many ways

 Jurisprudence or jurisprudence is the theory of law, study and philosophy
 isamen samast vidhik siddhanth sammilit hai, jo kanoon banaate hai
 Jurisprudence scholars, also known as jurists or legal theorists, hope to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, legal reasoning, legal systems and legal institutions
 vidhi ke vigyaan ke rup main vidhishastra, vidhi ke bare main ek vishesh tarah kii khojbin he
 In the ordinary sense, all statutory principles are inherent in jurisprudence
 vidhishastra "jurisprudence" arthath Juris = vidhaan, Prudence = gyaan
 In this sense all the books of law are books of law

 Jurisprudence theory has three parts - analytical jurisprudence, historical jurisprudence, and moral jurisprudence
 vishleshnatmak shakha main krambaddh vaidhanik siddhant ke darshanik athwa saamaanya vichaar hote hai; aitihaasik shakha main vaidhanik itihaas kaa darshanik athwa saamaanya bhaag hota he; naitik shakha main vidhannirmaan ke darshanik siddhant rahete hai
 But these three branches are inter-related
 at: inhen ek duusare se pruthak kar inpar vichaar nahin kar sakate
 See, Analytical Jurisprudence vishleshnatmak vidhishastra kaa uddeshy hota he - 'vidhaan ke moulik siddhanton kaa vishleshan'
 It is necessary to consider their historical origin, development, moral sense or belief in this context

 In other words, it is a history of the basic principles of legislation and the spirit of their method
 naitik vidhishastra, vidhaan kii vivechna naitik ganbhiry evam isaki purnataa kii drushti se karata he
 The intellectual element of the system of law or its historical development has no purpose
 vidhaan ke uddeshy evam kis seemaa tak tathaa kis rup main isaki purti hoti he, yahi iskaa vishay he
 Generally, its goal and purpose is to follow justice by the physical power of the state under a political firm

 Legislation is also included in the study of a sociologist but is different from his point of view
 vakil, adhivaktaa yaa nirnaayak ke rup main, un niyamon ko dekhtaa he jinhen sarsaadhaaran ko anukaran karnaa chahie
 The sociologist observes what these rules are
 kuch had tak donon saath chal sakate hai, kyonki vastav main ye niyam vaanchit charitra ke dyotak hai
 But the sociologist is more keen in the actual character, not in the idea of the desired character
 vaidhanik samajashaastra ko aparaadhashastra bhi kehete hai
 It studies all of these because of the crimes, the character of the criminals, the impact of various types of punishments on criminals - especially the extent to which the punishment is reduced by crime

 Likewise, environmental reform law, free legal aid for the poor, etc
 The interdisciplinarity of jurisprudence and other social sciences is a product of exchange of knowledge and mutual effects
 vidhishastra vidhi kii vibhinn shakhaon kii moolbhoot sankalpanaaon ke saiddhanthik aadhaaron kaa hi gyaan nahin karaata he balki unke antarsambandhon kaa bhi gyaan karaata he
 Jurisprudence does not only administer justice through the legal system, but through the discovery of new principles, ideas and other routes, it helps in establishing a just society

 cheri khilanaa samaaroh japan main ek vishesh saamaajik puraatanta ke samay jab unke kalakaaron, sangeetkaaron or kaviyon ke saath abhijaat khil sakuras ke tahat kuch samay kharch se ghatana he
 It turns out that "hanami" means "flower viewing" and for non-japanese as well as those who do not possess knowledge of Japanese culture, it is wonder why seeing some flowers in a park is a special event
 It might be surprising
 Sakura japani samskruti or samaaj main ek chihn he or aksar japani kala main dikhaaya gaya he or yahaan tak ki candi wrappers par
 phulon kii ek mahila kii durlabh saundarya kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or ek taraf apane uttam aakarshan se, yah sirf varsh ke dauraan das dinon ke liye khilata he
 It can literally be a flower "late bloomer," but when it is it is certainly the most beautiful of its kind
 cheri khilanaa samaaroh dekhne ke paaramparik tarika he parkon or mandiron or kuch paramparaagat japani sangeet, nrity or yahaan tak ki ek chaay samaaroh ke saath is anuthe bor kii khubsuurati puja yatra he
 In modern times, Hanami is more celebrated with a picnic or a party
 kuch logon ko lagata he ki yah abhi japani logon ke liye ek samay ke liye apane videshi mitron ke saath sharaab pi janaa he
 But, for others, there is more than that
 cheri khilanaa samaaroh bandhan ko ek samay hota he or baar or tokio main Roppongi jile ke club ke baahar apane doston ke saath baahar lataka
 The cherry blossom ceremony in Japan is also an occasion for foreigners to wear a Yukata
 When wearing a Japanese costume, visit a nearby park, which is favored by the big Japanese people
 That way, you can avoid rowdy picnic-goers
 park thodaa gulabi phulon ke saath chhaayankit hai or ke rup main hawa gir pankhudiyon gusts ek jaadui ghumaav aakarshith
 sabhi ke saath purna khil aap is adbhut anubhav main le jaaya jayega main ped
 yadi aap nikat se dekhne, phool rang main lagbhag safed rang kii hoti he, lekin agar tum dur se ped ghadi he, yah ek sundar or behosh gulabi rang diya he
 Seeing Sakura, these sweet little flowers are clearly a symbol of simplicity and beauty
 pahelija rahi ho jaao!cheri khilanaa mahotsav aam taur par der march se madhya april prayek varsh ke liye hota he
 Odds' n Rupis a distinctive feature of this flower is that it is very difficult to predict when the flower will bloom
 Hence, there is no fixed date for the Cherry Blossom Festival and in Japan they have a "cherry Blossom Forecast" for those who are patiently waiting for flowers to come out of their buds
 Many organizations or groups have a Hanami plan only to realize that the Sakuras are still in their sleepy state during their picnic or party
 yadi aap japan main tokyo mahanagareey yaa kisi bhi shahar main ek bheed bhare park main aane hoga, raat main cheri khilanaa mahotsav kii koshish karo
 Also known as "viewing night" this type of Hanami is only done in famous gardens in Japan and Sakuras are also made and each blossom is attractive with illuminating lights
 ek japani bageeche or apane garm hari chaay pine main aawaara, yah kaam karne kaa anubhav yaa japan ke aasapaas paryaton ke ek din baad tanaav ko kam kar sakate hai
 Instead of young people, you will often meet families, old Japanese or couples out for a romantic date while watching "night"
 After eating or drinking, be sure to clean your mess
 Although most people think that it is a time for a drinking spree, some prohibit bringing alcohol during Park Hanami
 ant main, aap ek prasiddh mandir yaa cheri khilanaa mahotsav ke liye ek bheed bhare park kii yatra nahin he
 The sakura tree is planted along the streets of Japan and just in a quick turn to the left or right you will find a little place worshiping their beauty

 The term "antibiotic" was used by Selman Waxman in 1942 to refer to solids or liquids produced by a single microbe, which are opposed to the growth of other microorganisms at high concentrations
 is mul paribhaasha main prakritik rup se praapt hone vaale thos yaa taral padaarth nahin hai, jo jeevanuon ko maarane main sakasham hote hai, par sookshmjivon dwaara utpann nahin kiye jate or inamen salphonamide jaise synthetic jeevanurodhi yogic bhi nahin hote hai
 Many antibiotics are relatively small molecules, weighing less than 2000 Da

 Some antibiotics are still produced by living organisms such as aminoglycosides and are isolated and made from other purely artificial methods - such as sulfonamides, quinolones, and oxazolidinones
 utpatti par aadhaarit is vargeekaran- prakritik, semisynthetic or synthetic ke atirikt sookshmjivon par unke prabhaav ke anusaar pratijaivik ko mote taur par do samoohon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa hai: ek to ve, jo jeevanuon ko maarthe hai, unhen jeevanunashak agent kaha jaataa he or jo bacteria ke vikaas ko durbal karte hai, unhen bacterostatic agent kaha jaataa he
 Before the beginning of the twentieth century, the treatment of many infectious diseases was based on pharmacological proverbs
 pracheen chini chikitsa main sankraman ke ilaaj ke liye paudhon se praapt pratijaivik tatwon kaa upyog 2,500 saal pehle shuru hua
 Many ancient civilizations such as ancient Egypt, ancient Greeks and medieval Arabia used fungi and plants to treat infections
 17 veen sadi menkunain kii chaal kaa upyog malaria ke ilaaj ke liye vyapak rup se hota tha, jo rogajinas plasmodium ke protozon paraseete ke kaaran hota he
 Scientific efforts to understand why diseases occur, the development of synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy and the isolation of natural antibiotics proved to be milestones in the development of antibiotics
 multah antibiosis kahe jane vaale pratijaivik waisi dawaaen hai, jo bacteria ke khilaaf kaam karti hai
 The term antibiosis means "against life" and was introduced by the French bacteriologistvillemin to describe the effect of these drugs
 And after the discovery of antibiotic penicillin, the use of salvarsan as an antibiotic came to an end
 arleach ke kaaryon, jisase pratijaivik kranti kaa janm hua, ke baad 1932 main domeck ne prontosil kii khoj kii

 The discovery of antibiotics produced by natural microorganisms was influenced by earlier work on the inspection of antibiosis among microbes
 pashchar ne kaha 'ki agaraham kuch bacteria ke bich paraspar virodh kii prakriya main hastkshep kar sakate hai to isse 'shaayad chikitsa vigyaan ke liye kaaphi ummiden paidaa hongi
 penicillium spp ke bacteria ke paraspar virodh kaa sabase pehla varnan jon tindan ne 1875 main england main kiya
 However, his work did not receive much attention by the scientific community until Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928
 Even then the therapeutic potential of penicillin was not fully believed
 uske das saal baad, ernest chen or harvard flore ne bi

 It also had low toxicity and could be taken without causing adverse effects
 iske alaava, isaki gatividhi mawaad jaise jaivik ghatakon se avaruddh nahin hoti thi, jaisaa ki us samay uplabdh synthetic pratijaivik salphonamide ke prayog se hota tha
 The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented

 penicillin kii unki khoj ke kaaran ernest chen, harvard flore ko 1945 main sanyukt rup se nobel puraskaar pradaan kiya gaya
 Florey credited dubose with starting the search for antibacterial compounds wholeheartedly and systematically
 a similar method led to the discovery of germicidin, which revived Florey's discovery in penicillin
 roganurodhi chikitsa ke safal parinaam ke liye ek pratijaivik kii gatividhiyon kaa moolyankan mahatvapurn he
 Factors of non-microbe viruses, such as host immunity mechanisms, location of infection, present as a disease are subtle components of intrinsic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic antibiotics
 mul rup se pratijaivik dawaaon kaa vargeekaran aise ho saktaa he ki jo jeevanuon ke khilaaf ghaatak yaa jeevanunashak karrwai karte hai yaa ve jo bacterostatic he, jinka kaam jeevanuon kii vruddhi ko rokna he
 Antibiotic activity of antibiotics is dependent on their phased growth and not all, but in most cases the "destructive" potential of the drug requires the division of cells during the action of antibiotic antibiotics
 ye vargeekaran prayogshaala main dikhe vyavhaar par aadhaarit he; vyaavhaarik rup se ye donon ek jeevanu ke sankraman ko khatm karne main sakasham hai
 Information on the 'in vitro activity' of the action of antibiotics, the minimum inhibitory concentration of antimicrobial and antimicrobial potency for activity evaluation are excellent indicators of antimicrobial ability
 haalanki, chikitsakeey gatividhi main, akele ye kadam nidanmoolak parinaamon kii bhavishyavaanee ke liye aparyaapt hai
 The combination of the pharmacokinetic profile of an antibiotic with the antimicrobial activity has shown significant signs of drug effectiveness in many pharmacological parameters
 pratijaivik dawaaon kii gatividhi ekaagratha par nirbhar he or unki roganurodhi gatividhi uttarottar roganurodhi pratijaivik sandratha ke saath badhati jaati he
 They may also be based on time, where their antimicrobial activity does not increase with an increase in antibiotic concentrations, however, it is also important that the minimum inhibitory concentration serum be maintained for a specific period
 Laboratory evaluation of the antibacterial elements used to kill Curvis is useful in determining actimicrobial activity based on timing or concentration
 aamtaur par pratijaivik dawaaon kaa vargeekaran unki karrwai ke tantra, rasinic sanrachana yaa gatividhi ke spectrum ke aadhaar par hota he
 Most antibiotics target the function of bacteria or their growth process
 pratijaivik dawaaen, jo bacteria kii koshika diwaar yaa koshika jhilli, yaa aavashyak jeevanu anzime par lakshya kendrit karti hai, saamanyat: jeevanunashak prakruti kii hoti hai
 Those that target protein synthesis, such as aminoglycosides, microlides, and tetracycline, are usually bacteriostatic and have a specific classification based on their targets: such as "compressed spectrum antibiotics" in particular types of bacteria, such as Gram negative, Or targets Gram-positive bacteria, while broad-spectrum antibiotics Affect a wide range
 pichley kuch varshon main pratijaivik dawaaon ke teen nae varg nidaan ke liye istemaal kiye ja rahe hai
 Thus, it has taken 40 years to discover new classes of antibiotic compounds
 in nai pratijaivik dawaaon ke nimnlikhit teen varg hai: cyclic lipopapatids, glicilsiclins ,or oxajolidinons 
 tigeciclin ek vyapak spectrum pratijaivik he, jabaki do anya kaa upyog gram-positive sankraman ke ilaaj ke liye hota he
 These developments can be seen as an expectation of a means of measuring bacterial resistance to current antibiotics
 1939 main pehali baar flore or chaiyn ke ahm prayaason ke baad se chikitsa main pratijaivik dawaaon ke mahatv ke kaaran inaki khoj or utpaadan ke liye shodh kii prerana mili he
 The process of production usually involves inspection and testing and modification of broad categories of microorganisms
 utpaadan kinvan ke jariye, aamtaur par majboot aerobics tareeke se kiya jaataa he
 Oral antibiotics are swallowed, while intravenous antibiotics are used in more severe cases, such as deep-seated systemic infections
 pratijaivik kaa prayog kabhi-kabhi baahar se bhi kiya jaataa he, jaise aankh main daali jane vaali dawaaen yaa maraham
 Although antibiotics are generally considered safe and well-tolerated, they are also widely associated with adverse effects
 dushprabhav kai tarah ke, vividh roopon vaale or puri tarah pratijaivik ke upyog or lakshyit kiye jane vaale sookshmjivon par nirbhar hote hai
 The safety profile of treatment with new drugs is not as established as the drugs used for many years
 pratikul prabhaav bukhaar or michali se lekar photodermatitis or anophilix jaise bade allergy tak ke rup main dikh sakate hai
 One of the most common side effects is pain, sometimes caused by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium difficile, and is caused by the antibiotic disturbing the normal balance of the intestinal flora
 rog paidaa karne vaale bacteria kii is tarah ativruddhi ko pratijaivik lene ke dauraan pro-biotic kii khuraaq lene khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 Antibiotics may also increase the number of bacteria that are normally present as components of the vaginal flora and may lead to the over-development of the genus Candida yeast in the vulva-vaginal area
 duusari dawaaon ke saath antarkriyasheeltaa se duusare parshv kuprabhavon bhi dikh sakate hai, jaise pranaligat corticosteroid ke saath ek quinolon pratijaivik lene se kandra kii kshati kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 It is estimated that some antibiotics interfere with the effectiveness of birth control pills in two ways
 antra flora main sanshodhan se estrogens ke avasorana main kami aa sakati he
 Secondly, taking hepatic liver enzymes increases the metabolism of the active ingredients of the pill and may affect the usefulness of the pill
 haalanki zyaadaatar adhyayanon ke jariye yah sanket miltaa he ki pratijaivik dawaaen garbhanirodhakon ke kaam main hastkshep nahin karti hai
 Although some percent of women experience less effect of birth control pills while taking antibiotics, the failure rate can be compared to women taking pills
 iske alaava, koi anya adhyayan nahin dikhataa he, jisase antim taur par pataa chale ki pet ke flora main vyavdhaan garbhanirodhak ko prabhavit karata he
 This may be caused by taking the oral contraceptive pill through the induction of liver enzymes by the antifungal drug grisofulvin and broad-spectrum antibiotic rifampicin
 isliye sifarish kii jaati he ki in antimicrobeales ke prayog se roganurodhi chikitsa ke dauraan atirikt garbhanirodhak upayon kaa sahaara lenaa chahie
 Alcohol can interfere with the activity of antibiotics or metabolites, which can affect the activity of liver enzymes, thereby eliminating the effect of antibiotics
 iske alaava, metronidazol, tinidazol, sifamendol, ketaconajol, latmoxef, sifoprajon, sefemenoksime or furajolidine jaise kuch pratijaivik alcohol ke saath pratikriya karte hai, jisase gambhir parshv kuprabhav, jinamein ulti, michali or saans kii takalif shaamil he, dikhte hai
 Therefore, alcohol should not be consumed while taking such antibiotics
 Additionally, alcohol consumption may decrease serum levels of doxycycline and erythromycin succinate under certain circumstances
 pratijaivik pratirodh kaa udbhav ek vikasshil prakriya he, jo jeev ke chayan par aadhaarit he or jisase pratijaivik dawaaon kii khuraaq ke liye jivit rahane kii kshamta main vruddhi hui he, jo pehle ghaatak hota tha
 Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which were once considered miraculous cures, are now shown to be less effective, as bacteria are becoming more resistant
 pratijaivik khud ek chaynaatmak dabaav ke rup main kaam karte hai, jo ek nishchit sankhya main pratirodhi jeevanuon ke vikaas kii anumati dete hai or phir saralata se nasht hone vaale jeevanuon ko jivit rakhte hai
 Antibiotic resistant mutant organisms already present within the bacterial population were demonstrated through the Luria – Delbrück experiment in 1943
 jeevanu kaa jivan aksar viraasat main mili pratirodh kaa parinaam hota he
 Any antibiotic resistance demands a biological price and the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria can be affected by decreased fitness along with resistance, which proves beneficial in keeping bacteria alive especially when antibiotics are not present
 haalanki, atirikt utparivarti jeev fitness kii keemat kii bharpai or in jeevanuon kaa astitv behaal rakhane main madad kar sakate hai
 The underlying molecular resistance mechanism leading to antibiotic resistance can vary
 jeevanu kii anuvanshik banaavat ke kaaran moolbhoot pratirodh swaabhaavik he bacterial gunasutra us protein ko encode karne main vifal ho saktaa he, jise pratijaivik nishaanaa banaata he
 Acquired resistance arises from changes in the bacterial chromosome or acquisition of additional chromosomal DNA
 pratijaivik utpaadit karne vaale jeevanu saral se jatil banane ke pratirohak tantra kaa hissaa hote hai, dekhne main unke jaise hi hote hai or pratijaivik pratirodhi upabhedon main sthanantarit ho sakate hai
 The spread of antibiotic resistance mechanisms occurs via horizontal genetic exchange through peak transmission of inherited changes from previous generations and genetic recombination of DNA
 pratijaivik pratirodh kaa plasmid dwaara vibhinn jeevanuon ke bich vinimay ho saktaa he, jo jeevanurodhi pratirodh ko incode karte hai or jisase ekaadhik pratijaivik kaa sah astitv sambhav hota he
 These plasmids may hold distinct genes with diverse resistance mechanisms and may belong to unrelated antibiotics, as they produce more plasmid multiple antibiotic resistance than one antibiotic transferred
 vaikalpik rup se bacteria ke bheetar anya pratijaivik kaa aapasi pratirodh tab hota he, jab chune gayi ek pratijaivik se zyada ke pratirodh ke liye jimmevaar vaisaa hi pratirodh tantra paidaa hota he
 Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics are a major factor in the emergence of resistant bacteria

 Antibiotics frequently indicate where they are not needed, or that the use is incorrect or that the antibiotic given is of minor effect
 yah kuch vaise maamalon main bhi hota he, jahaan sankraman bina ilaaj ke bhi thik ho saktaa he
 Antagonists such as penicillin and erythromycin, which were once considered miraculous cures, began to emerge from the 1950s on resistance to its anti-inflammatory elements

 aisa pratijaivik likhte samay unhen lene ke antaraal kaa ullekh nahin karne, sankramit jeev ke puri tarah swasth hone ke liye aaraam kaa abhaav hone se bhi pratijaivik vifal ho sakate hai
 Doing so will help in increasing the population of bacteria with antibiotic resistance
 Inappropriate antibiotic treatment is a common form of antibiotic abuse
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan ke rup main, ham aam sardi-zukam ke liye viral sankraman dur karne vaali pratijaivik dawaaon ke istemaal ko le sakate hai, jiskaa us par koi asar nahin hota

 Multidisciplinary intervention by both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics
 shwaas nalika ke sankraman kaa sahaj nidaan ke liye pratijaivik dawaaon ke lene main 48 ghante kaa vilamb pratijaivik ke istemaal ko kam kar saktaa hai
 However, this strategy can decrease the feeling of satisfaction in the patient
