 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 Sher Shah's father had two wives and eight children
 shershah ko bachapan ke dino main uski sauteli maan bahut sataati thi to unhone ghar chhod kar jonpur main padhai kii
 After completing his studies, Sher Shah went to the service of Zamal Khan in 1522
 par unki sauteli maan ko ye pasand nahin aayaa
 So he left the service of Zamal Khan and went to the court of Bahar Khan Nuhani, the self-proclaimed independent ruler of bihar
after apane pita kii mrityu ke baad farid ne apane paitruk zagir par kabza kar liya
 Later, there was a dispute between Sherkhan and his half-brother Suleman for this manor
 bahaar khan ke darbar me wo jald hi unke sahaayak niyukt ho gaye or bahaar khan ke naaballig bete kaa shikshak or guru ban gaye
 But in a few years Sher Shah lost the support of Bahar Khan

 In a sudden attack on Bengal in 1537, Sher Shah captured a large area of it, although he survived a direct confrontation with Humayun's forces
 abhi tak shershah apane aap ko mughal samraaton kaa pratinidhi hi bataata tha par unki chahat ab apana samrajya sthapit karne kii thi
 Seeing the growing power of Sher Shah, finally the Mughal and Afghan forces fought on the plains of Buxar in June 1539
 mughal senaaon ko baari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 This victory extended the empire of Sher Shah from the hills of Assam in the east to Kannauj in the west
 ab apane samrajya ko vaid banane ke liye unhone apane naam ke sikkon ko chalaane kaa aadesh diya
 This was an open challenge to the Mughal emperor Humayun

 The more powerful vortex is commonly called mail stromes in English
 aise kisi bhi bhavar ke liye vortex shabd uchit hota he jisamen nimnadhara hoti he
 Small vortexes can be easily observed when there is a drainage in a bath or a sink, but they are quite different from natural vortices
 chote bhavar kai jharanon ke aadhaar sthaan par dikhaai dete hai
 In the case of powerful waterfalls like the Niagara Falls, the vortices can be quite powerful
 sabase shaktishaalee bhanwaron kaa nirmaan sankeern uthle jaldmarumadhya main teji se pani bahane ke saath hota he
 There are five of the world's most powerful vortices, the Solstromen outside Bodo in Norway, with a speed of 37 km / h; Mosxtromen in Lofoten Island, Norway, with a speed of 27
8 km / h; Old So, in Eastport, Maine, United States, with a speed of about 27

 They say that there is another similar vortex between the island of Britain and the province of Galicia and that it is filled twice a day with the sudden inundation of the CN area and the Aquitaine coast agreement
 Go so that anyone who is even a little away from the sea can get out with great difficulty

 'nammala' or 'anekarthmanjari' 'nandadaasan' ke do kosh milte hai
 From the nominal works of these verses created, there is a sense of their form

 The word compilation in the medieval lexicons of Hindi has been mainly based on some of the famous Sanskrit lexicons
 iske atirikt 'bhikhaarodas' aadi ke saahitiyik bhashagranthon se bhi shabd sankalit hue he
 From the time of 'khusrau' and the books affected by them, there is an attempt to collect the words of life or speech

 But, like 'amarkosh' etc
, there was no system of gender instruction in the Hindi dictionary

 Medieval Hindi dictionary probably wanted to make Hindi dictionary based on Sanskrit dictionary available before them
 iskaa ek or bhi atyant mahatvapurn evam sambhavit kaaran kaha ja saktaa he
 The most important purpose of the dictionary is to understand the readers of Vadmaya texts
 parantu sanskrit koshon or tadadhaarit hindi koshon ke nimarteon kii mukhya drushti thi aise koshon ke sampadan par jo visheshtah kaviyon ore saamanontah anya granthkaaron ke prayogarth paryaayavachi shabdbhandar ko sulabh bana den

e
 Nirukta, most attention has been given to Vedartha-interpretation
 sanskrit sahitya ke rachanaatyak granthon ke tikaakaron ne arthbodhan ke liye hi kosh vachanon ke uddhran die hai
 Yet, in the view of most Sanskrit lexicons, assisting in the creation of poetry — synonyms were perhaps a very important goal
 Similarly, making words accessible for proper translation in syllables, metaphors, etc
, was the main task of many non-word words — collectors
 
 hindi ke koshaakaari ne bhi sambhavat is prerana ko apana priytar uddeshy samajha
 For this reason, the responsibility of making the corpus of the historical and cultural dictionary accessible to the non-cultural people was also found in the Hindi dictionary
 thode se koshkaron ne aarambh main paryaay yaa anekarth shabdo main nae shabd jode
 But the independent effort to move much further was reduced
 phir bhi kuch koshkaron ne tadbhav aadi shabdon kii thodi bahut vruddhi karne kaa praayas kiya
 Overall, one can say that in the medieval Hindi dictionaries, no element of Koshavidya was progressed
 sanskrit koshon kii pramanik praudhata main usee prakaar kuch hraas hi hua jaise, reetikalin sahityashastra ke hindi-lakshan-granthon main sanskrit ke tadvishyak vishishtagranthon kii paudhata kaa
 The aspect of derivation was completely abandoned in the medieval lexicons of Hidi
 sanskrit koshon main bhi yah paksh upekshit hi rahaa par kosh ke anek tikaakaron ne vyutpatti par dhyaan diya
 In the 'explanation Sudha' or 'ramashrayi' commentary of 'amarkosh' each etymology of 'amarkosh' is given
 hindi ke madhyakalin koshon kii na to waisi tikaayen likhi gai or na tadbhav shabdon kii vyutpatti kaa anushilan hi hua
 Hence, there is no progress in terms of developmental skills of phonology
 aswan kisi mishrit drav ke avyavon ko unke vaashpan-sakriyataaon ke antar ke adhar par unhen alag karne kii vidhi he
 It is a physical method of separation and not a chemical change or a chemical reaction
 vyavsaayik drushti se aswan ke bahut se upyog hai
 It is used to separate various ingredients of crude oil
 pani kaa aswan karne se uski ashuddhiyaan nikal jaatin hai or adhik shuddh jal praapt hota he
 Nowadays the word distillation is used in a wider sense than the old one
 bhabhake main vashpavan dravya ko udaana or udi hui bhaap ko thanda karke phir chua lenaa, yah sabaki sab prakriya aswan kehalaati he
 The purpose of distillation is that any vapor fraction can be separated from other vapor constituents
 puraane samay main aswan kii is vidhi kaa upyog keval aasavon arthath madiraa ke samaan peya taiyaar karne main kiya jaataa tha, par aajkal aswan dwaara anek rasinic dravyon kaa shodhan kiya jaataa he
 a simple definition of distillation is to steam the solvent out of the solution and then condense it
 is paribhaasha ke bheetar 'saadhaaran aswan' or 'prabhajit aswan', donon sammilit hai
 One method that is similar to distillation is called sublimation
 urdhvapathan main vashpavan thos padaarth bhabhake main garam karke udaaya jaataa he or phir us bhaap ko thanda karke thos shuddh padaarth praapt kar liya jaataa he
 In Loksakthya, the word "asava" is used in the sense of sura or liqueur
 drakshasav, ushirasav aadi aasav ayurveda granthon main prasiddh hai
 The earliest mention of Asuta Sura in the episode of Sautramani is found in the 19th chapter of the Yajurveda
 suradhani kumbhi vah paatr tha jisamen taiyaar kii hui sura rakhi jaati thi
 Drugs such as dry ginger, punarnava, pippali etc
 were used in making sura from unripe paddy and barley
 lagbhag teen raat ye padaarth pani main sadate rahete the or phir ubaal or chaanakar sura taiyaar kii jaati thi
 The most excellent example of distillation in nature is the rise of water vapor from the saltwater of the sea, then the steam reaching the colder part of the atmosphere, cooling and raining as pure water
 varsha kaa jal ek prakaar se shuddh asut jal he, parantu barasate samay yah saadhaaran vayumandal se apdravya kaa shoshan kar letaa he
 The equipment used for distillation in laboratories and factories mainly consists of three parts: bhabhake main vah mishran rakhaa jaataa he jisamen se vashpavan ansh pruthak karnaa hota he
 These are made of kach, copper, iron or clay according to their use
 sharaab banane ke kaarkaanon main bahudhaa tambe ke bane bhabhakon kaa prayog hota hai
 And glass speeches in laboratories
 bhabhake ke neeche bhatthi yaa garam karne ke nimitt kisi upyogi saadhan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Steam from the steam reaches the condenser
 sanghnitr anek prakaar ke prachlit hai
 The purpose of all condensers is that the steam cools down quickly and thoroughly
 yah aavashyak he ki sanghnitr main adhik se adhik prishth us hawa yaa pani ke sampark main aae jiske dwaara bhaap ko thanda hona he
 Copper is a good conductor of heat
 isaki nalikaayen yathesht patali ban sakati he; at: kaarkaanon main adhiktar tambe ke hi sanghanitron kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 In fact, the condenser is a device in which the hot steam cools from one end to the other
 jin dravyon ke kvathanank bahut unche hai, unki bhaap hawa se thandi kii ja sakati he
 Air condensers are used for this
 alcohol, benzin, ether aadi dravon kii bhaapon ko thanda karne ke liye aise sanghanitron kaa prayog hota he jinamein pani ke pravaah kaa prabandh ho
 The third part of the distillation apparatus is the receiver
 yah vah paatr he jisamen bhaap ke thanda ho jane par bana hua drav ikaitha kiya ja sake
 There are many types of receipts as well
 teen prakaar ke aswan mahatvapurn maane jate hai - prabhajit aswan, nirvaat aswan or bhanjak aswan
 In divided distillation, a solution, that is, a mixture, can be separated from those liquids whose boiling points are sufficiently different
 dravon kaa vaashp prabhajit aswan ke sanghanitron main is prakaar kramash: thandha kiya ja saktaa he ki grahi main pehle ve drav hi chue jo saapekshat: thandha kiya ja saktaa he jo saapekshat: adhik vashpavan hon
 The heat which is used for this work increases gradually
 nirvaat aswan ke liye aisa prabandh kiya jaataa he ki bhabhake or sanghnitr ke bheetar kii vaayu pump dwaara bahut kuch nikal jaae
 The boiling point of the solvents also decreases when the air pressure is over the solution and they can be distilled at relatively low temperature
 bhanjak aswan ek prakaar kaa shushk aswan hota he
 The best example of this is coal distillation
 pathar ke koyale main pani kaa ansh to kam hi hota he, par jab vah adhik tapt kiya jaataa he to uske prabhanjan dwaara anek padaarth banate hai jinhen bhaap banaakar udaaya or phir thanda karke thos yaa drav kiya ja saktaa he
 Some gases can also be formed in the sun which do not become liquid or solid when they are cold, but they are useful only in the form of gas; For example, it is possible that these gases can be used to create light or heat by burning them with air
 pathar ke koyale se prabhanjak aswan se is prakaar kii gaison ke atirikt criyosot, nafthaileen aadi padaarth praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 Kerosene distillation can also be done
 saadhaaran aswan kaa upyog itr taiyaar karne main bhi kiya jaataa he
 Steam, distillation is used in preparing perfume
 pani kii bhaap ke saath saath itr udaae jate hai or sanghnitr main thanda karke pani or itr kaa mishran grahi main praapt kiya jaataa he

 Nilgai may appear to be a safe creature, but males are extremely quarrelsome
 ve maadaaon ke liye aksar lard padate hai
 Their way of fighting is also unique
 apni qamar ko kaman kii tarah upar kii ore modakar ve dhire-dhire ek-duusare kaa chakkar lagaate hue ek-duusare ke najadik aane kii cheshtaa karte hai
 On coming closer, they sit on the knees of the front legs and push each other with their long and sturdy necks
 yon apni gardanon ko uljhaakar ladate hue ve jirafon ke samaan lagate hai
 The more powerful male tries to strike his sharp horns at the backside of his opponent
 jab kamjor nar bhaagane lagata he, to vijayi nar apni jhaadu-jaisi poonch ko hawa main jhande ke samaan fahraate hue or gardan ko jhukaakar maidan chhodkar bhaagate pratidwandvi ke peeche daud padataa he
 Thus the fighting males are completely oblivious to the surrounding events and can be taken very close to them
 prayek nar kam-se-kam do maadaaon par adhikaar jamaata he
 Nilgai makes very little sound, but the female is sometimes similar to a buffalo
 nilgai saal ke kisi bhi samay joda baandhti he, par mukhya prajnan samay november-janvari hota he, jab naron kii neeli jhiwali khaal sabase sundar avasthaa main hoti he
 After mating, the males separate from the females and form their own herd
 in jhundon main avyask nar bhi hote hai, jinaki khaal abhi neeli or chamakili nahin hui hoti he
 The herds of females have 10–12 members, but the males migrate to larger herds, which can have up to 20 males
 inamen chote chhaunon se lekar vayask naron tak sabhi umron ke nar hote hai
 These males are very quarrelsome and keep trying repeatedly with each other
 jab jhagadne ke liye koi nahin miltaa to ye apane singon ko jhaadiyon main athwa jameen par hi de maarthe hai
 Nilgai is extremely vigilant when grazing or sleeping
 sustaane ke liye vah khuli jameen chunati he or ek-duusare se peeth sataakar letati he
 Thus, while lying down, one member of the herd keeps a watch on every direction
 koi khatra dikhne par vah turant khadaa ho jaataa he or dabi aawaaj main pukaarane lagata he
 Chhauns are born in September – October when the height of the grass is high enough to hide them
 ye chhaune paidaa hone ke aath ghante baad hi khadey ho pate hai
 Sometimes twins are born
 chhaunon ko jhund kii sabhi maadaaen milakar paalati hai
 When hungry, Chhaun goes to any female and drinks milk
 nilgai atyant garmi bhi bardaasht kar sakati he or dupahar kii kadi dhoop se bachane ke liye bhar thodi der chhaanv kaa sahaara leti he
 She does not need to drink much water because she gets the required moisture from her diet
 nilgai bharat ke un anek khushnaseeb praaniyon main se ek he jinhen logon kii dharmik manyataon ke kaaran suraksha praapt he
 Since the word "cow" is associated with the name of this animal, people do not kill it as a sister of a cow, although the Nilgai is quite damaging to the standing crop
 use paaltu banaaya ja saktaa he or nar nilgai se bail ke samaan halki gaadi khinchvaai ja sakati he

 History and Contribution of Newspaper: Although a newspaper is considered as a beginning by a former officer of British rule, but its form was not like that of newspapers
 vah keval ek panne kaa suchanaatmak parchaa tha
 The Purnarupen newspaper was brought out of Bengal by Viceroy Hickey under the name of 'bengal-gazette'
 aarambh main angrejon ne apane phaayde ke liye akhabaaron kaa istemaal kiya, chunki saare akhbaar angreji main hi nikal rahe the, isliye bahusankhyak logon tak khabaren or suchnaayen pahunch nahin paati thim
 The news that came out and passed through the system, used to spread its terror there
 unke khilaaf na to mukademe hote or na hi unhen koi dand hi diya jaataa tha
 People were silent despite facing these hellish circumstances
 is dauraan bharat main ‘da hindustan times’, ‘neshnal herald', 'pyniyar', 'mumbai-mirar' jaise akhbaar angreji main nikalate the, jisamen un atyaacharon kaa dur-dur tak ullekh nahin rahata tha
 In addition to these English papers, letters were published in Bangla, Urdu etc
 but the scope was limited
 use koi bengali padhane vaala yaa urdu jaanane vaala hi samaj saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the first issue of Hindi's first letter 'udant Martand' was published on 30 May 1826
 yah patr saptahik tha
 The introduction of 'udant-martand' attempted to tie people together at the linguistic level
 yah keval ek patr nahin tha, balki un hajaaron logon kii jubaan tha, jo ab tak khamosh or bhaybheet the
 The introduction of letters in Hindi led to a revolutionary change in the country and the war of independence
 unhen kaaphi tod-marodakar prastut kiya jaataa tha, taaki angreji sarkaar ke atyaacharon kii khabaren dabi rah jaaen
 British soldiers entered any area and behaved arbitrarily
 lut, hatya, balaatkaar jaisi ghatnaayen aam hoti thim
 Whichever area he found a new direction
 ab logon tak desh ke kone-cone main ghat rahi ghatnaon kii jaankaree pahunchne lagi
 But shortly after, Jugal Kishore, the editor of this letter, had to close the letter on 11 December 1827 for lack of assistance
 10 may 1829 ko bengal se hindi akhbaar 'bangadoot' kaa prakaashan hua
 This letter also became the voice of the people and a medium to keep them connected
 iske baad july, 1854 main shyamsundar sen ne kalakatta se ‘samachar sudhaa varshan’ kaa prakaashan kiya
 During that time, any newspaper or newspaper published any news or article against the British Government, it had to pay its price
 akhabaaron ko pratibandhit kar diya jaataa tha
 Its copies were burnt, its publishers, editors, writers were punished
 un par baari-bharkam jurmaana lagaaya jaataa tha, taaki wo dubaara phir uthne kii himmat na juta paaen
 As the wave of independence was spreading across the country, newspapers were also becoming more and more tolerant of atrocities
 yahi vajah thi ki bengal vibhaajan ke uparaant hindi patron kii aawaaj or buland ho gai
 Lokmanya Tilak edited 'kesari' and Lala Lajpat Rai took out the letter 'vande Mataram' from Punjab
 in patron ne yuvaaon ko aazaadee kii ladaai main adhik-se-adhik sahyog dene kaa aahvaan kiya
 These letters created a passion for independence
 ‘kesari’ ko nagpur se madhavrao sapre ne nikaala, lekin tilak ke uttejk lekhon ke kaaran is patr par pabandi laga di gai
 Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi started publishing the weekly letter 'pratap' from Kanpur in 1913 to revive the freedom struggle in North India
 isamen desh ke har hisse main ho rahe atyaacharon ke bare main jaankariyaan prakashit hoti thim
 This triggered outrage among the people and they were even more excited to overthrow the British rule
 isaki aakraamakata ko dekhte hue angrej prashasan ne iske lekhakon, sampadakon ko tarah-tarah kii pratadnaayen deen, lekin yah patr apane lakshya par data rahaa
 Similarly, letters were being published from the areas of Bengal, Bihar and Maharashtra
 un patron ne logon main swatantraaa ko paane kii lalak or jaagrukta failaane kaa prayaas kiya
 If it is said that these newspapers were not inferior to any weapon for freedom fighters, then there would be no exaggeration
 akhbaar bane aazaadee kaa hathiyaar press aaj jitna swatantra or mukhar dikhataa he, aazaadee kii jang main yah utani hi bandishon or paabandiyon se bandhaa hua tha
 Neither was there a form of entertainment in it nor was it a source of income
 ye akhbaar or patr-patrikas aazaadee ke jaanbaajon kaa ek hathiyaar or madhyam the, jo unhen logon or ghatnaon se jode rakhata tha
 There was no such warrior of the freedom struggle, who did not try to speak through the newspapers
 gandhiji ne bhi ‘harijan’, ‘yang-india’ ke naam se akhabaaron kaa prakaashan kiya tha to moulana abul kalam aaazaad ne 'al-hilaal' patr kaa prakaashan
 There are many other examples that prove that newspapers and magazines had an important role in the freedom struggle
 yah vah daur tha, jab logon ke paas samvaad kaa koi saadhan nahin tha
 Even then, the helpless people who were victims of the atrocities of the British used to bear all the atrocities silently
 na to koi unki sunne vaala tha or na unke du:khon ko harne vaala
 Even if they used to say to whom and how? Everyone was facing the same torture
 aise main patr-patrikaon kii shuruyaat ne logon ko himmat di, unhen dhanjhas bandhaaya
 This was the reason that every article of the revolutionaries used to communicate new vigor and patriotism in the public
 bhaaratendu kaa naatak ‘bharat-durdasha’ jab prakashit hua tha to logon ko yah anubhav hua tha ki bharat ke log kaise daur se guzar rahe hai or angrejon kii manshaa kya he
 a nuclear weapon or nuclear bomb is an explosive device whose base of destructive power is nuclear reaction
 yah nabhikeey sanlayan yaa nabhikeey vikhandan yaa in dono prakaar kii nabhikeey abhicriyon ke sammilan se banaaye ja sakate hai
 Both types of reaction result in huge amount of energy from very few materials
 aaj kaa ek hajaar kilo se thodaa bada nabhikeey hathiyaar itani urja utpann kar saktaa he jitani kai arab kilo ke paramparaagat visphotakon se hi utpann ho sakati he
 Nuclear weapons are known as destructive weapons
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main sabase adhik shaktishaalee visphotak, jo prayukt hua tha, uskaa naam 'blockbster' tha
 In its construction, 11 tons of the most widely known explosive trinitrotoluene was used till then
 is visphotak se 2000 guna adhik shaktishaalee pratham parmaanu bam tha jiskaa visphot tii
 en
 tii
 ke 22,000 ton ke visphot ke baraabar tha
 Now more powerful atomic bombs have been made than the first atomic bomb
 parmaanu bam main visphutit hone vaala padaarth uranium yaa plutonium hota he
 Power is achieved only by nuclear fission of uranium or plutonium
 iske liye parmaanu ke cendrak main neutron se prahaar kiya jaataa he
 a very large amount of energy is obtained from this stroke
 is prakram ko bhautik vigyaani nabhikeey vikhandan kehete hai
 Neutrons are free from the neutrons in the interior of the atom's nucleus
 ye neutron anya parmaanuon par prahaar karte hai or unase phir vikhandan hota he
 They then fission other atoms
 is prakaar shrunkhlaa kriyaayein aarambh hoti hai
 The uncontrolled series of atomic bombs result in the explosion of the atom with great intensity
 uranium ke kai samasthanik gyaat hai
 Normal uranium contains 99
3 percent U-238 and 0
7 percent U-235
 you-238 kaa vikhandan utani saralata se nahin hota jitani saralata se you-235 kaa vikhandan hota he
 U-235 has three neutrons less than U-238
 neutron kii is kami ke kaaran hi you-235 kaa vikhandan saralata se hota he
 Other fissile materials used in atomic bombs are U-233 and plutonium-239
 parmaanu visphot ke liye vikhandaneey padaarth kii kranthik sanhati aavashyak hoti he
 Critical code is the minimum amount of current for a chain action
 yadi vikhandaneey padaarth kii maatra kranthik sanhati se kam he to neutron keval dhurradhurr karata rahegaa
 Increasing the volume slowly will create a time when at least one free neutron strikes a new atom and breaks it down
 aisi sthiti pahunchne par vikhandan kriya swat: chalane lagati he
 The volume of the Revolutionary Code is confidential
 jo raashtra parmaanu bam banaate he ve hi jaanate hai or dusron ko batalaate nahin
 If the critical code of the U-235 is 20 pounds, then the series action will not start by taking ten to ten pounds two
 20 pound ko ek saath lene se hi shrunkhlaakriya chaalu hogi
 The number of neutrons in the chain increases very quickly
 parmaanu bam main vikhandan se uranium or use nikatavarti anya padaarthon kaa taap badi shighrata se upar uthta he
 Metallic uranium transforms into incandescent gas at high pressure and temperature
 visphotak pind kaa taap 10,00,00,000° se
 tak uth jaataa he
 At such a high temperature, the uranium plate is removed
 tab sara pind badi prachandta se visphutit hota he
 Atomic bombs erupt and produce half-waves that propagate around at speeds greater than the speed of sound

 Then the Muslim Subedar there, enchanted by his form Lavanya, decided to marry him himself
 seth satidasji ko bulaakar unke saamne apana prastaav rakhaa

 Seth Sati Das Ji was full of the blood of Hindutva in the Kirag-rag, he strongly rejected the proposal of Subedar

 shri laal bahadur shastri rashtriya sanskrit viapeeth ke sansthaapak dow mandan mishra ke bare main anyatra dekhen
 Mandan Mishra was a well-known teacher of former epistemology
 kumaril bhatta ke baad inhen ko pramaan mana jaataa he
 His faith is respected in Advaita Vedanta philosophy too
 ye bhartruhari ke baad kumaril ke antim samay main tathaa aadi shankaracharya ke samakaleen the
 He wrote original texts on both the philosophy of Mimamsa and Vedanta
 mimasaanukramanika, bhaavnavivek or vidhivivek - ye teen granth mimasaa par; shabd darshan par sphotsiddhi, pramanashastra par vivek tathaa advait vedant par brahmasiddhi - ye inke granth hai
 Shaliknath and Jayant Bhatt mentioned Mandana while refuting Vedanta
 shankar bhashya ke suprasiddh vyaakhyaata, bhaamati ke nirmaataa vachaspati mishra ne mandan kii brahmasiddhi ko dhyaan main rakhkar apni kriti likhi
 Mandalash Mishra and Shankaracharya's place of learning, Mandleshwar is a holy city situated on the Narmada River
 The Chhappan Dev Temple, the site of the scripture is ancient and the famous entrance site of Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya is a great place to visit Gupteshwar Mahadev Temple
 Due to which Mandleshwar is very famous
 ek parampara ke anusaar mandan kumaril bhatta ke shishy the
 This was later defeated by Sankaracharya in scripture and became a monk and was named Suresvaracharya
 mandan or sureshwar ek hi hai yaa alag-alag - isko lekar bada vivaad hua he
 Most of the evidence is in favor of the difference between the two
 mandan ne shabdadvait kaa samarthan kiya he, par sureshwar iske bare main maun hai
 Mandan to a great extent endorsed the otherwise radicalism in Advaitprasthana, but Sureshwar refutes it
 mandanke anusaar jeev avidya kaa aashray he, sureshwar brahm ko hi avidya kaa aashray or vish maanate hai
 On the basis of this difference, two departures of Advaita Vedanta started
 bhaamati prasthaan mandan kaa anuyaayi bana, vivaran prasthaan sureshwar ke siddhanton par chalaa
 Sureshwar considers pure knowledge to be the path of salvation, but according to Mandana, salvation is not attained by listening to the Vedanta, unless Agnihotra etc
 Karma is cooperative of knowledge
 mandan mishra kumaril bhatta ke shishy the, is baat kaa koi akatya pramaan nahin miltaa
 This is said only on the basis of 'shankar-digvijay', which is an extremely apocalyptic story-book
 mandan or sureshwar kii bhinnata ke hi jab adhikansh pramaan milte hai to yah kaha janaa kisi bhi tarah se uchit nahin he ki mandan hi shastrarth main parajeet hokar sureshwar bane the
 The fact that there is a debate between these two great men is purely imaginary and strategic, promoted in the medieval period by Shankar's monastery
 shabdadvait, anyathaakhyatvaad, avidya, jeev, brahm aadi ke bare main sureshwar ke jo bhi vichaar hai, ve shat-pratishat shankaracharya ke anugami hai
 Love of the Guru's feet is his ultimate goal
 ve ashishnutaa kii had tak mandan kaa virodh karte hai or unhen alag prasthaan kaa advaithavedanti bataate hai
 Then, how can the same Sureshwar himself be a Mandan? The originator of 'description-departure' is not 'description-car', while 'bhamati-departure' follows full mandana
 jab kisi bhi pracheen granth main mandan or sureshwar ko ek nahi mana gaya he, tab hamaare vidwaan-gana kyon shastrarth ke myth kaa boj sar par uthaae yug-yug se pareshaan ho rahe hai
 Even now the truth has to be accepted
