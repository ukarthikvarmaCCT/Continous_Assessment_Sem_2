 Hyderabad is the capital of the state of Telangana
 Between 1983 and 1989, N
 T
 Rama Rao served as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh
 During his tenure, he spent large sums to erect several statues of people from the region's political and religious history
 During his visit to New York, he saw the Statue of Liberty and was inspired by the efforts to restore it
 He said "I wanted something like that 


 That would have been my contribution to society
" Rama Rao chose to depict Gautama Buddha because "he was a humanitarian who told the whole truth to the people
 It is our pride
" After a long search, he found a solid white granite rock near Raigiri, Bhongir on a mountainside 46 km outside Hyderabad
 In October 1985 NTR inaugurated work on structure
 For over a year, hundreds of labourers helped the temple architect and builder smganapathi Sthapati create the statue
 After five years and the careful of US $ 3 million, the statue stood at 58 feet and weighed 350 tons, making it the world's tallest monolithic statue of the Buddha
 a concrete platform measuring 15 feet, now referred to as the "rock of Gibraltar," was constructed in the middle of Hussain Sagar to aid in erecting the statue
 The roads of the city were also widened for this purpose
 This statue is located at Lumbini Park in the Hussain Sagar Island can be reached by boat in 15 minutes
 Then government of Andhra Pradesh led by NT Rama Rao was ousted in 1989
 By the next year, the statue was ready for erection
 ABC Limited, a local company, was given the responsibility of transferring the statue onto the concrete platform
 Using a trailer vehicle, the statue was brought to the shore of Hussain Sagar
 On 10 March 1990, company workers shifted the statue on top of a barge
 After traveling only 100 yards, the statue tipped and fell into the lake
 The accident killed 10 people
 After a two-year salvage operation, the statue was pulled out of the lake
 On 1 December 1992, the statue was installed on the platform successfully
 In 2006, the Dalai Lama consecrated the statue after performing a ritual

 In the context of business and organization, management means - to coordinate the work of people by utilizing the available resources efficiently and effectively so as to ensure the achievement of goals
 prabandhan ke antargat aayojan, sanghathan-nirmaan, staffing, netritv karnaa, tathaa sanghathan athwa pahal kaa niyantran karnaa aadi aate hai
 Regardless of whether the organization is large or small, for profit or non-profit, providing services or manufacturing, management is essential for everyone
 prabandh isliye aavashyak he ki vyakti samuhik uddeshyon kii purti main apana shreshthatam yogadan de saken
 Management involves mutually related tasks that all managers perform
 prabandhak alag-alag kaaryon par bhinn samay lagaate hai
 Managers at the higher levels of the organization spend more time on planning and organization than managers at the bottom
 kai lekhakon ne prabandh kii paribhaasha di he
 The word manga is a plural term widely used for all kinds of verbs
 vaise yah kisi bhi udhyam kii vibhinn kriyaaon ke liye mukhya rup se prayukt hua he
 From the above example and the study of the situation, it must have become clear that management is the action which is necessary in every organization in which people are working as a group
 sanghathan main log alag-alag prakaar ke kaary karte hai lekin vah abhi samaan uddeshy ko paane ke liye kaary karte hai
 Management provides direction in people's efforts and achieving the same objective
 is prakaar se prabandh yah dekhtaa he ki kaary puure hon evam lakshya praapt kiye jaaen kam-se-kam saadhan evam nunatam laagat par ho
 Hence, management can be defined as the process of completing tasks with the aim of achieving the objectives effectively and efficiently
 hame is paribhaasha ke vishleshan kii aavashyaktaa he
 There are some words that need to be described in detail
 ye shabd hai- The process used in the definition refers to the primary task or actions that the management performs to complete the tasks
 ye kaary hai- niyojan, sanghathan, niyuktikaran, nirdesan evam niyantran jin par charchaa is adhyay main evam pustak main aage kii jaaegi
 Effective or actually doing the job effectively means actually completing the given task
 prabhavi prabandh kaa sambandh sahi kaary ko karne, kriyaaon ko puraa karne evam uddeshyon ko praapt karne se he
 In other words, its function is to get the final result
 lekin maatr kaary ko sampann karnaa hi paryaapt nahin he iskaa ek or pahalu bhi he or vah he kaarykushalta arthath kaary ko kushaltapurvak karnaa
 Efficiency means doing the job correctly at minimum cost
 isamen ek prakaar kaa laagat-laabh vishleshan evam aagat tathaa nirgat ke bich sambandh hota he
 If we gain more by using less means then we will say that there is an increase in capacity
 kshamta main vruddhi hogi yadi usee laabh ke liye athwa nirgat ke liye kam sadhano kaa upyog kiya jaataa he evam kam laagat vyay kii jaati he
 Input means are those which have the money, goods, equipment and human resources required to do a particular task
 swabhaavik he ki prabandh kaa sambandh in sansadhano ke kushal prayog se he kyonki inase laagat kam hoti he evam ant main inase laabh main vruddhi hoti he
 These two words are related to each other despite being different
 prabandh ke liye prabhavi evam kshamtawan donon kaa hona mahatvapurn he
 Both effectiveness and skill are two sides of the same coin
 lekin in donon pakshon main santulan aavashyak he tathaa kabhi-kabhi prabandh ko kushalta se samjhauta karnaa hota he
 For example it is easy to be effective and ignore efficiency which means completing the work but at a high cost
 udhaaharan ke liye, mana ek company kaa lakshya varsh main 8,000 ikaayiyon kaa utpaadan karnaa he
 To achieve this goal most of the time, the manager was not effective when the electricity was not available, but not efficient because more inputs were used for the same output
 kabhi-kabhi vyavsaay kam sansadhano se maal ke utpaadan par adhik dhyaan kendrit karata he arthath laagat to kam kar di lekin nirdhaarit utpaadan nahin kar paae
 As a result, the goods could not reach the market, hence its demand was reduced and it was replaced by the competitors
 yah kaarykushalta lekin prabhaavapurntaa kii kami kii sthiti he kyonki maal bazaar main nahin pahunch paaya
 Therefore, it is more important for the manager to achieve the goals at the lowest cost
 iske liye prabhaavapurntaa evam kushalta main santulan rakhana hota he
 Generally high work efficiency is accompanied by high effectiveness which is the goal of all managers
 lekin bagaiyr prabhaavapurntaa ke ucch kaary kushalta par anaavashyak rup se jor dena bhi avaanchhneeya he
 Weak management is due to lack of both effectiveness and efficiency
 kuch paribhaashaon ke adhyayan ke pashchaat hamen kuch tatwon kaa pataa lagata he jinhen ham prabandh kii aadharbhoot visheshtaayen kehete hai
 Management serves to fulfill certain objectives
 uddeshy kisi bhi kriya ke apekshit parinaam hote hai
 These should be derived from the basic purpose of the business
 kisi bhi sanghathan ke bhinn-bhinn uddeshy hote hai tathaa prabandh ko in sabhi uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam dakshata se paanaa hota he
 Objectives can be classified into organizational objectives, social objectives and personal objectives
 prabandh, sanghathan ke liye uddeshyon ke nirdhaaran evam unako puraa karne ke liye uttaradaayi hota he
 It has to achieve many types of objectives in all fields and keep in mind the interests of all the stakeholders like shareholders, employees, customers, government etc
 kisi bhi sanghathan kaa mukhya uddeshy maanav evam bhautik sansadhano ke adhiktam sambhav laabh ke liye upyog hona chahie
 Which means meeting the economic objectives of the business
 ye uddeshy hai- apane aapako jivit rakhana, laabh arjeet karnaa evam badhotaree
 The basic objective of any business is to maintain its existence
 prabandh ko sanghathan ke bane rahane kii disha main praytn karnaa chahie
 For this the organization should earn enough money to meet the costs
 vyavsaay ke liye iskaa bane rahanaa hi paryaapt nahin he
 Management has to ensure that the organization makes a profit
 laabh udhyam ke nirantar safal parichaalan ke liye ek mahatvapurn protsaahan kaa kaary karata he
 Benefits are necessary to meet the costs and risks of the business
 deergh avadhi main apni sambhaavnaaon main vruddhi vyavsaay ke liye bahut aavashyak he
 For this, the growth of business is very important
 udyog main bane rahane ke liye prabandh ko sanghathan vikaas kii sambhaavna kaa puraa laabh uthaanaa chahie
 Business growth can be measured as sales turnover, increase in the number of employees or increase in the number of products or investment of capital, etc
 samaaj ke liye laabhon kii rachana karnaa he
 Whether the organization is a business or a non-business, it has to fulfill some social obligations as it is a part of the society
 iskaa arth he samaaj ke vibhinn angon ke liye anukool aarthik mulyon kii rachana karnaa
 This includes adopting a different environment of production, providing employment opportunities to the deprived sections of the society and providing facilities like school, baby house for the employees
 aage box main ek nigamit saamaajik daayitv ko puraa karne vaale sanghathan kaa udhaaharan diya gaya he
 The organization consists of people from whom their personality, background, experience and purpose are different
 ye sabhi apni vividh aavashyaktaaon ko santushti hetu sanghathan kaa ang banate hai
 These vary from financial requirements such as competitive salaries and other benefits to social needs such as peer recognition and higher level needs such as personal growth and development
 prabandh ko sanghathan main talmail ke liye vyaktigat uddeshyon kaa sanghathanaatmak uddeshyon ke saath milan karnaa hota he
 Management is a universal action that is an integral part of any organization
 ab ham un kuch kaarnon kaa adhyayan karenge jiske kaaran prabandh itnaa mahatvapurn ho gaya he- Management is as old as civilization
 yadhyapi aadhunik sanghathan kaa udgam nayaa hi he lekin sangathit kaary to sabhyataa ke pracheen samay se hi hote rahe hai
 In fact the organization can be considered as the distinguishing feature that distinguishes civilized society from uncivilized society
 prabandh ke prarambh ke vyavhaar ve niyam evam kanoon the jo sarkari evam vanijyik kriyaaon ke anubhav se panape
 Principles and practices of management developed with the development of trade and commerce respectively
 ‘prabandh’ shabd aaj kai arthon main prayukt hota he jo isaki prakruti ke vibhinn pahaluon ko ujagar karte hai
 The study of management has developed along with modern organizations in the past
 yah prabandhakon ke anubhav evam aacharan tathaa siddhanton ke sambadh samooh donon par aadhaarit rahaa he
 In the past, it has developed into a dynamic subject
 jisaki apni vishisht visheshtaayen hai
 But it is necessary to answer a question related to the nature of management whether management is science or art or both
 To answer this, let us study the characteristics of both science and art and see how far the management fulfills them
 kala kya he? kala icchit parinaamon ko paane ke liye vartmaan gyaan kaa vyaktigat evam dakshatapurna upyog he
 It can be obtained through study, observation and experience
 ab kyonki kala kaa sambandh gyaan ke vyaktigat upyog se he isliye adhyayan kiye gaye moolbhoot siddhanton ko vyavhaar main laane ke liye ek prakaar kii moulikta evam rachanaatmakataa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The basic characteristics of art are as follows- kala yah maanakar chalati he ki kuch saidhantik gyaan pehle se he
 Experts in their respective fields have proposed some basic principles that are used in a particular type of art
 udhaaharan ke liye nrity, jan sambodhan / bhaashan, kala athwa sangeet par sahitya sarvamaanya he
 Use of this basic knowledge varies from person to person
 kala, isiilie atyant vyaktigat avadharana he
 For example, two dancers, two speakers, two artists or two writers will differ in the performance of their art
 sabhi kala vyavhaarik hoti hai
 Art is the creative use of knowledge to current principles
 ham jaanate hai ki sangeet saat suron par aadhaarit he
 But the music composition of a musician is unique or different, it depends on how these notes are used in music creation, which is its own interpretation
 prabandh ek kala he kyonki, yah nimna visheshtaon ko puraa karti he- a manager is a hierarchical knowledge group that clarifies any general truths or general principles
 The basic characteristics of science are as follows: vigyaan, gyaan kaa krambaddh samooh he
 Its principles are based on the relation between cause and consequence
 udhaaharan ke liye, ped se seb kaa tuutakar prithvi par aane kii ghatana gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ko janm detii he
 Scientific theories are first developed through observation and then tested and tested under controlled conditions repeatedly
 vaigyanik siddhant, vaidhata evam upyog ke liye saarvbhaumik hote hai
 On the basis of the above characteristics, we can say that as a management science, it has certain characteristics- sabhi prakaar kii sanghathan prakriyaaon kaa prabandhan aavashyak he
 You must also have observed that organizations require certain qualifications and experience to manage them
 aapane yah bhi paaya hoga ki ek ore to vyavsaay nigamit swaroop main vruddhi hui he to duusari ore vyavsaay ke prabandh par adhik jor diya ja rahaa he
 Does this mean that management is a profession? To know the answer to this question, let us study the salient features of the profession and see if the management fulfills them
 peshey kii nimna visheshtaayen hai All professions are based on a well-defined set of knowledge that can be acquired through education
 peshey main pravesh, pariksha athwa shaikshanik yogyata ke dwaara simit hoti he
 For example, in India, if one wants to become a Chartered Accountant, one has to pass a special examination conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India
 sabhi peshey kisi na kisi parishad sabha se jude hote hai jo inamen pravesh kaa niyaman karte hai kaary karne ke liye pramaan patr jari karte hai evam aadhaar samhita taiyaar karte hai tathaa usko lagu karte hai
 To advocate in India, lawyers have to become members of the Bar Council which regulates and controls their actions
 sabhi peshey aachaar samhita se bandhe hai jo unke sadasyon ke vyavhaar ko disha dete hai
 For example, when doctors enter their profession, they take an oath of their work ethic
 peshey kaa mul uddeshy nishtha evam patibaddhta he tathaa apane graahakon ke hiton kii sadhana he
 a lawyer ensures that his client gets justice
 prabandh, peshey ke siddhanton ko puri tarah se puraa nahin karata he
 Well it has some characteristics which are as follows- prabandh ek saarvbhaumik shabd he jise, kisi udhyam main sambandhon ke samooh main ek duusare se jude logon dwaara kuch kaaryon ko karne ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Everyone has the responsibility to complete a particular task in this chain of relationships
 is uttardaayitv ko puraa karne ke liye use kuch adhikaar die jate hai arthath nirnay lene kaa adhikaar
 This relationship of authority and responsibility binds individuals to each other as officers and subordinates
 isse sanghathan main vibhinn staron kaa nirmaan hota he
 There are three levels in the authority chain of an organization- ucch stareey prabandh-yah sanghathan ke varishthatam kaaryakari adhikari hote hai jinhen kai naamon se pukaara jaataa he

 For this paryvekshiya athwa prachaalan prabandhak- sanghathan kii adhikaar pankti main forman evam paryvekshak nimna str par aate hai
 Supervisors directly observe the work of the workforce
 inke adhikaar evam karttavya ucch prabandhakon dwaara banaai gai yojanaon dwaara nirdhaarit hoti hai
 Supervision, managers have an important role in the organization as they communicate directly with the actual work force and communicate the guidelines of middle level managers to the employees
 inhen ke prayatnon se utpaada kii gunvattta ko banaae rakhaa jaataa he, maal kii haani ko nunatam rakhaa jaataa he evam suraksha ke str banaae rakhaa jaataa he
 The quality of workmanship, and mere production, depends on the hard work, discipline and loyalty of the employees
 prabandh ko sanghathan se sadasyon se kaaryon ke niyojan, sanghathan, nideshan evam niyantran evam nirdhaarit uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye sanghathan ke sansadhano ke prayog kii prakriya mana gaya he

 niyantran ko prabandh ke kaary ke us rup main paribhaashit kiya he jisamen vah sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye sanghathan kaary ke nishpaadan ko nirdeshit karata he
 Levels of execution are determined in the control function, the current performance is measured
 iskaa purvanirdhaarit staron se milan kiya jaataa he or vichlan kii sthiti main sudharatmak kadam uthaae jate hai
 For this, managers have to determine what work and production are important for success, how and where it can be measured and who is authorized to take corrective steps
 suhasini ne jab paaya ki uske dizinkartaaon kii team ne palang kii vah chadar banaai jo unki vikray ke liye nishchit mulya se adhik mahangi thi tab usne laagat par niyantran ke liye chadar hetu kapadaa hi badal diya

 The tasks of the manager are related to each other and it becomes difficult to determine which work ended where and which work started from where
 kisi sanghathan ke prabandhan kii prakriya main ek prabandhak ko paanch ek duusare se sambandhit kaary karne hote hai

 The process of monotony of activities of different departments is called coordination

 Higher level managers coordinate with their subordinates to ensure that the organization's policies are implemented
 madhyastar ke prabandhak, ucchstar ke prabandhakon evam pratham pankti ke prabandhakon, donon ke saath samanvay karte hai
 Operations level managers coordinate the tasks of their employees to ensure that the work is done according to plans 
 samanvay sochaa-samajha kaary he- ek prabandhak ko vibhinn logon ke kaaryon kaa dhyanpurvak evam soch samajhakar samanvay karnaa hota he
 In a department, members work voluntarily in cooperation with each other, coordination coordinates this spirit of cooperation
 samanvay ke na hone par sahyog bhi nirarthak siddh hoga or bina sahyog ke samanvay karmchaariyon main asantosh ko hi janm degaa
 Therefore we can say that coordination is not a separate function of management but it is its essence
 yadi koi sanghathan apane uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam kushalta se praapt karnaa chahta he to use samanvay kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Coordination is an integral part of all the functions of coordination in the same way as the thread in the rosary
 vibhinn prabandhkeey kaaryon ko ekikrut karnaa vyaktiyon evam vibhaagon main paryaapt maatr main samanvay ko sunishchit karata he
 As such, the constant change inherent in a large-scale organization due to coordination problems is weak or passive leadership and complexities
 bade sanghathanon main is prakaar kii jatiltaaon ke samanvay ke liye vishesh prayatnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Size of organization - Large number of people engaged in large organizations complicate the problem of coordination
 prayek vyakti apane aap main vishisht he
 And realizes the needs of himself and the organization
 prayek kii apni kaary karne kii aadaten hai, apni prishthbhumi hai, paristhitiyon se nipatane ke prastaav / tareeke hai tathaa dusron se sambandh hai
 By the way, a single person does not always act wisely
 uske vyavhaar ko na to sadaa thik se samajha jaataa he or na hi puri tarah se uskaa purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, for the efficiency of the organization, it is essential that the objectives of the individual and the group are integrated by coordination
 kaaryaatmak vibhedikaran- sanghathan ke kaaryon ko baar-baar vibhaagon, prabhaagon, virgon aadi main baanta jaataa he
 The problem of coordination arises because the jurisdiction becomes stronger and the barriers between them become even stronger
 kai baar yah isliye hota he kyonki kaaryon kaa vargeekaran yukti sangat nahin hota yaa phir prabandhak tark sangat maarg na apana kar anubhav kaa maarg apanaate hai
 In such cases, coordination is necessary to function effectively in the organization
 vishishtikaran- aadhunik sanghathanon main ucch str kaa vishishtikaran he
 Specialization is born due to the intricacies and functions of modern technologies and the diversity of those who do them
 visheshgy sochate hai ki ve ek duusare ko peshey ke aadhaar par jaanchne ke yogya hai lekin duusare logon ke paas is prakaar ke nirnay kaa koi paryaapt aadhaar nahin ho saktaa
 If experts are allowed to work without coordination in front of a global manager, the results will be very expensive
 isiilie sanghathan main lage vibhinn visheshgyon ke kaaryon main samanvay hetu ek rachana tantra kii aavashyaktaa he
 Coordination is the essence of management
 yah kuch aisa nahin he taki jiske liye ek prabandhak aadesh de
 Rather it is something that a manager tries to achieve by planning, organizing, appointing, directing control tasks
 atah prayek kaary samanvay kaa abhyaas he
 Organization and their management is changing
 jaise-jaise vibhinn samskritiyon evam deshon kii seemayen dhundhlee pad rahi hai evam sampreshan kii nayi-nayi takneekon ke kaaran vishwa ko ek vaishvik gaanv samajha ja saktaa he
 International and intercultural relations are also growing rapidly
 aaj kaa sanghathan ek vaishvik sanghathan he jiskaa prabandh bhumandaleey paridrishy main kiya jaataa he
 In summary, one can say that a global manager is one who has both 'hard' and 'soft' skills
 jo prabandhak vishleshan karnaa, vyuharachna karnaa, ejineering evam praudyogiki kaa gyaan rakhte hai unki aaj bhi aavashyaktaa he lekin vishwavyaapee safalataa ke liye vyaktiyon main team kaise kaary karti he, sanghathan kaise kaary karte hai evam logon ko kis prakaar se abhiprerit kar saktaa he, is sabaki samaj kaa hona bahut aavashyak he
 For example, a manager who has access to different cultures can work in Western Europe, a non-english speaking country, then move to developing countries like Malaysia or Kenya and then to an office in New York, USA
 Can be transferred
 vah in teenon sthanon par turant prabhavi dhang se kaary kar sakegaa
 The role of global manager has evolved in the same way that global industry and economy have developed
 yah ek paribhaashit vyavsaay ke sandarbh main ek aiami bhoomika se bahuaiami bhoomika main parivartit ho gaya he jiske liye takneekee kaushal, sofrat prabandh evam kaushal evam vibhinn samskritiyon ko grahan karnaa evam seekhney ke sammishran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Electromechanical or 'electro-metallurgy' is an important branch of electrical science and technology, which is related to the extraction and refining of metals by electrochemical experiments
 yah saamanyat: do virgon main vibhajit he, ek main ushnata or duusare main rasinic kriyaayein pradhan hai
 Electricity dissolves metal minerals by generating heat in the furnace
 pratirohak tathaa preran bhatthiyon main dhaatuon ke drudhikaran or shodhan ke saath-saath bijli se bhalaai kii kala isi shrenee main aati he
 Electric chemical applications include electrolysis, decomposition of chemical compounds, metal refining, and separation

 Electro-metallurgical operating methods can be divided into four important parts - vaidyut prapti vah vidhi he jisamen The metal of high quality and purity is obtained by electrical finishing method
 jis dhaatu ko shuddh karnaa hota he, use lavniya athwa amleey vilyan main upyukt aakaar kaa anode, tathaa usee kii shuddh nikshipt dhaatu kaa cathod banaakar lataka dete hai
 By electro-decomposition, a very pure metal is obtained as a coating at the cathode
 bahumoolya dhaatuon kii ashuddh anode se uplabdhi, saadhaaran vaidyutparishkaran kala main, ek mahatvapurn gaun parishkaran he
 Often copper, bismuth, gold, silver, lead and ranga aqueous solutions are purified by electrolysis

 Metals such as copper, cadmium, chromium, gold, nickel, sodium, silver, magnesium, ranga, zinc, and alloys such as brass, bronze, silver-cadmium, etc
 are generally electrolysed on an industrial scale
 aluminium kaa utpaadan electrovining vidhi kaa ek bahut acha udhaaharan he
 Electrolytic copper production is an all-time cosmic example of electrical refinement
 utpaadan kaa 90 pratishat se adhik tanba isi dhang se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Electrolysis is popular for several reasons
 bahudhaa yah alankaarik tathaa sajaavati sampoorti ke liye kiya jaataa he or isse sanksharan pratirodh sataha bhi praapt kii jaati he
 Sometimes it is very useful and satisfactory in repairing broken or worn surfaces, especially in big machines, motors, steam turbines, dinamos, generators etc
 adhatvik vastuon par dhatvik electroplatting ko electrophorming kaha jaataa he
 By this, using electrophoresis of graphite or fine metals for electrolysis on these items, they easily achieve electromagnetism
 bahudhaa kam vidyut daab kaa prayog karte hai

 muunge kii bahut si qismon main, yah jeev apane ird-gird ek bahut hi sakht shankh bana lete he, jiske andar vah rahata he
 When such tens of thousands of small and extremely hard shells are formed in a group by sticking to each other, the hardness and touch of that group is almost like stone
 samudr main kai sthanon par muunge kii bade kshetra par faili hui shrunkhlaayein ban jaati hai, jinhen reef kaha jaataa he
 Every coral and its shell in any coral group is called "polyp" in scientific language
 muunga garam samudron main hi ugta he or alag-alag rangon main miltaa he
 Coral precious stones of red and pink colors are cut and polished like stone and used in ornaments
 inke sab se lokapriy rang ko bhi muunga kaha jaataa he
 Coral is a type of worm living in the seaside, which makes a house like a shell and goes on accumulating with each other
 ye krimi achar jeevon main hai
 As they grow in descent, their group grows in size to that of the thuur tree
 sumatra or java ke aasapaas prashanth mahaasaagar main samudr ke tal main aise samoohpind hajaaron mile tak khadey milte hai

 There are many islands in the Pacific Ocean which are called 'atolls'
 muunge kii keval guria hi nahin banati; chadi, kursii aadi chijen bhi banati hai
 The behavior of coral in the form of jewelery is also similar to that of pearls for many days
 moti or muunge kaa naam praayah saath saath liya jaataa he
 The coral is also mentioned in the books of Ratna Examination
 saadharantah muunge kaa dana jitna hi bada hota he, utana adhik uskaa mulya bhi hota he
 Poets have been giving coats of lips with coral since long time
 samudron ke kinaaron par basane vaale manushya hazaron saal se muunge se parichit hai or unhone dekha he ke kaise muunge ke reef bilkul paudhon kii tarah dhire-dhire badhate or failte hai
 But every creature inside the reefs is so small that it cannot be seen
 isliye hameshaa se log samajhate aae hai ke moonga ek tarah kaa sakht samudri paudha he
 For the first time in the eighteenth century, William Herschel saw the coral in a microscope and found its cells to resemble animal cells
 unhone ne yah bhi dekha kii jo muunge ke reef kaa hissaa sirf aankh ke dekhne main ek hi sakht paudhe kii ek tahani lagati he, vastav main sainkadon-hazaron nanhe jeevon kaa samooh he
 a coral organism is only a few millimeters large
 uski ek patali khaal hoti he jiske andar uskaa avaleh jaisaa maas hota he
 This Avalehi month is called "misoglia"
 muunge kaa ek munh hota he jiske ird-gird nanhe ungliyon-jaise sparshak pani main jhulate rahete hai
 Whenever a small creature or piece of food comes close to them, they grab it and push it in the mouth from where it goes into the coral's stomach
 jab yah khaanaa hazam ho jaataa he, to jo bhi na hazam hone vaala hissaa he, vah isi munh se baahar pani ke pravaah main thook diya jaataa he
 Infrared rays, infrared rays, or infrared are electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength is larger than direct light and less than the wavelength

 Electromagnetism or electromagnetic force is one of the four types of fundamental forces or interactions found in nature
 anya teen moolbhoot bal hai - prabal anyonyakriya, durbal anyonyakriya tathaa gurutvkarshan
 The electromagnetic force is expressed with the help of an electromagnetic field
 vidyutchumbakeey bal kai roopon main dekhne ko miltaa he, jaise vidyut aaweshit kanon ke bich bal, chumbakeey kshetra main rakhe vidyutwahi chaalak par lagane vaala bal aadi
 Electromagnetic force is often described as of two types - moolbhoot kanon ke bich lagane vaala bal vidyutchumbakeey bal hi hota he
 Quantum electrodynamics describes the force exerted between these particles

 This fact has also been proved by Gujarat explorer Pt
 Bhagwan Lal Indraji
 koi koi kehete hai ki i sanwat bharatvarsh ke samraat vikramaditya ne shuru kiya tha lekin samay ke gananaa main wo sahi nahin rahata
 Because Magadhke Emperor Chandragupta II conquered Ujjayini and Ayodhya and gave himself the title 'vikramaditya'

 Plate tectonics is a scientific theory that provides an explanation of the large-scale movements in the Earth's terrain
 saath hi mahadwipon, mahasaagaron or parvaton ke rup main dharatleey ucchavach ke nirmaan tathaa bhucamp or jwalamukhi jaisi ghatnaon ke bhugolic vitaran kii vyakhya prastut karne kaa prayaas karata he
 This theory evolved from the concept of continental displacement, envisaged in the first decade of the twentieth century, when new evidence was discovered in the 1960s that strengthened the concept of continents being dynamic rather than static
 in saakshyon main sabase mahatvapurn hai purachumbakatv se sambandhit sakshya jinase sagar nital prasaran kii pushti hui
 The discovery of Sagar Nittal Varshan by Harry Hayes is believed to be the beginning of the rendering of this theory and scholars like Wilson, Morgan, mckenzie, Oliver, Parker etc
 contributed to its promotion by providing evidence in its favor
 is siddhanth anusaar prithvi kii upree lagbhag 80 se 100 kimi moti parat, jise sthalmandal kaha jaataa he, or jisamen bhuparpati or bhupraavaar ke upree hisse kaa bhaag shaamil hai, kai tukdon main tuuti hui he jinhen plate kaha jaataa he
 These plates are floating on the semicircular layer of the asthenosphere at the bottom and are generally moving at a speed of about 10–40 mm / yr, although some have a velocity of 160 mm / yr
 inhi platon ke gatisheel hone se prithvi ke vartmaan dharatleey swaroop kii utpatti or parvat nirmaan kii vyakhya prastut kii jaati he or yah bhi dekha gaya he ki praayah bhucamp in platon kii simaaon par hi aate hai or jwalamukhi bhi inhen plate simaaon ke sahare paae jate hai
 In plate tectonics, the word tectonics is derived from the Greek language τεκτονικός meaning to relate to construction
 plate shabd kaa sarvapratham prayog canada ke bhuvigyaani wilson ne kiya tha or plate tectonix shabd kaa pehali baar prayog morgan dwaara kiya gaya tha
 According to this theory, the lithosphere, located as the upper layer of the earth, consisting of the crust and some part of the upper mantle, is divided into several pieces called plates
 saamanyatya in platon main badi platon kii sankhya saat maani jaati he
 Apart from this, there are some medium and small size plates
 inaki ek suchi nimnavat he: Some scholars consider the number six of the larger plates to be the same as the North American plate and the South American plate
 choti plates kii sankhya main bhi kai mataantar hai parantu saamanytah inaki sankhya 100 se bhi adhik sweekaar kii jaati he
 In the context of mountain construction, two views were first prevalent, by vertical movement and horizontal movement
 arthath kuch log yah maanate the ki prithvi kaa aakaar utpatti ke baad sankuchan dwaara chota hua or is sankuchan ke parinamswaroop prithvi kii sataha main bal pad gayi or mudaav parvaton ke rup main sthit he
 The concept was first propagated in Europe by Austrian Edward Swoos
 iske vipareet kuch kaa maananaa tha ki mahadwipon kaa kshaitij sthantharan hua he or inke takaraane se upree sataha main bal pad jane se parvaton kaa nirmaan hua he
 The first challenge to contractionists was when the concept of horizontal transfer of continents emerged
 shuruuaati solahavin sadi main hi vidwaanon ne atlantic mahaasaagar ke donon kinaaron kii ek duusare se samanta ko chihnit kiya tha
 The English philosopher Francis Bacon first marked this resemblance with the study of exact maps, with the cartographer Abraham Ortelius saying in 1596 that the Americas broke apart from Europe and Africa, and the German theologian Theodor Lilienthal's statement of Ortelius in 1756 Attempted to confirm on the basis of a biblical statement

 But no one paid much attention to his words
 wagonar ne, jo ek pura-vanaspati vigyaani or pura-jalwaayu vigyaani the, yah vichaar prastut kiya ki pracheen kaal main jalwaayu kaa vitaran praturup vyakhyayit ho saktaa he yadi mahadwipon ko gatisheel maan liya jaay or unhone 1912 main mahadwipiya visthaapan kaa siddhanth pratipaadit kiya jo unki 1915 main chhapi pustak mahadwipon evam mahasaagaron kii utpatti main prakashit hua
 Wagner was the first to use the term "continental displacement", following the same principle of Wagner that the development of plate tectonics was possible, although his ideas were also rejected by scholars for nearly half a century until evidence was available in the 1960s
 
 or mahadwipiya visthaapan Due to the mobility of the plates, there are three types of edges or borders: is prakaar ke kinaaron ke sahare do platen ek duusare kii ore gati karti hai or takaraakar unamem se baari plate halaki plate ke neeche kshepit hoti he
 This part, which is twisted downward, goes deep and melts and converts into magma due to the excess of heat and pressure
 jis gaharaai par yah ghatana hoti he use kshepan mandal yaa beniof zone kehete hai
 With the help of such edges, due to pressure of the landowners, they turn and form mountains
 neeche jaakar pighla padaarth megma plum ke rup main upar uth kar jwalamukhiyata bhi utpann karata he
 Where two plates move opposite to each other, that is, they move away from each other, magma rises up from the bottom to form a new plate
 in kinaaron par paae jane vaale sabase pramukh sthalaroop madhya mahasagariya katak hai
 Rift valleys are formed when this shore lies on a continent
 nayi plate ke nirmaan ke kaaran ise rachanaatmak kinaaraa bhi kehete hai
 The protective edge is the one with which the two platens are moving, rubbing each other, that is, neither descending nor converging
 saamanytah is kinare ke sahare ek duusare ko ragadate huye vipareet dishaao main gatisheel hoti hai kintu yah anivaary nahin he, yadi do platen ek hi disha main gatisheel hon or unki gati alag-alag ho tab bhi unke kinare ragadate huye sangrakshi kinaaraa bana sakate hai
 Transform faults are found on their support
 chunki inke sahare na to plate kaa nirmaan hota he or na hi vinaash, atah inhen sangrakshi / sangrakshnatmak kinare kehete hai jahaan nirmaan / vinaash ke sandarbhon main yathasthiti sangrakshit rahati he
 Plate tectonics theory offers the newest explanation of the construction of fine mountains
 udhaaharan ke liye alpine parvat tantra ke parvaton kii utpatti kii vyakhya ko prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 According to this theory it is believed that the series of mountains on the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean Sea are the result of tectonic events in the Tertiary era in which they were formed by compression between the African and European plates of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea
 himalay kii utpatti ke bare main bhi is siddhant kii yahi manyata he ki is parvatamala kii utpatti tibet plate or bhartiya plate ke paas aane or tethes sagar yaa bhusannati main jamaa avsaadon ke sampeden se hua he
 Jet currents are fast flowing and rotating air currents in the atmosphere of some planets including Earth
 prithvi par, mukhya jet dharaaen tropopoj kii oonchai par sthit hoti hai or ve pashchim se purv ore bahati hai
 Their paths are usually of a revolving shape
 jet stream do yaa do se adhik hisson main vibhajit ho sakati he, ek dhara main jud sakati he, yaa jet kii disha ke vipareet dishaao main bahati he
 The fastest speed jet currents are polar jets at altitudes 9–12 km above sea level, and high altitudes and some weak subtropical jets at 10–16 km
 uttari golardh or dakshini golardh main prayek dhruviya jet or ek uposhnkaribandheey jet he
 The polar jet in the northern hemisphere flows over Central America, Europe and Asia, and their intermediate oceans, while the polar hemisphere of the southern hemisphere flows mostly over Antarctica

 guide 1965 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 It is based on the novel The Guide of India's famous English writer RK Narayan
 film shuru hoti he vartmaan se jab raju jail se reeha ho rahaa he or phir kahani ateet main chalati he
 Raju is a guide who earns his money by turning tourists into historical sites
 ek din, ek amir or boodha puratatvavid marco unki yuva patni rozi, jo ki ek veshya kii beti he, ke saath shahar main aata he
 Marco wants to do some research in caves outside the city and hires Raju as his guide
 vah ek nai gupha kaa pataa lagaataa he or apane kaam main itnaa kho jaataa he ki rozi par dhyaan nahin detaa
 While Marco is searching for the cave, Raju takes Rosie for a walk and praises her dancing ability and innocence
 rozi raju ko bataati he ki vah ek veshya kii beti he or vah samaaj main sammaan hasil karne ke liye kaise marco kii patni bani, lekin uske liye usne ek badi keemat chukaai he kyonki use nrity kaa junun he jabaki yah marco ko sakht naapsand he
 Meanwhile, Rosie tries to commit suicide by consuming poison
 is ghatana kii khabar milane par marco gufaaon se waapas aata he or roji ko thik dekh kar kaafii naaraaz hota he or rozi se kahata he ki uski aatmahatya karne kii koshish ek naatak thi, anyathaa agar vah vastav main maranaa chaahati thi to adhik neend kii goliyaan khaakar yah aasaani se kar sakati thi
 One day when Rosie goes to the caves, she finds that Marco is in love with a tribal girl
 isko lekar rozi or marco main kaafii kaha-suni hoti he or rozi ek baar phir aatmahatya karne kii koshish karti he
 Raju explains to her that suicide is a sin and he lives to fulfill his dream
 rozi marco se sambandh tod leti he lekin ab use sar chupaane ke liye jagah chaiye or kisi kaa sahaara bhi jo use raju detaa he
 Rosie is also considered a prostitute in Raju's community
 raju kii maan or mamaa usase aagrah karte hai ki rozi ko ghar se baahar nikaal de lekin raju manaa kar detaa he to uski maan use chhodkar apane bhai ke saath rahane chali jaati he
 His friend and driver Ghafoor also takes a break from his life
 raju kii aamadani khatm ho jaati he or puraa shahar uske khilaaf ho jaataa he
 Despite all this, Raju encourages and helps Rosie to become a singer and dancer
 or jald hi rozi ek star ban jaati he
 As soon as Rosie touches new heights, Raju starts loitering and becomes gambling and addictive
 ab phir marco waapas aata he
 With a mind of trying to win Rosie back, he comes to meet Rosie and brings a bouquet of flowers
 bich main usase raju takaraa jaataa he or raju usase phulon kaa guladasta le letaa he
 Marco tells Raju that Rosie has some jewels stored in a locker and that Rosie's signature is needed to be removed
 raju, is ashanka main ki yadi marco or rozi dobaaraa mili to unke sambandh phir na sthapit ho jaayen, loker ke peparon main rozi ke jaali hastakshar kar detaa he, lekin marco ko rozi se milane nahin detaa he
 Meanwhile, Raju and Rosie's relations get upset when she even refuses Raju to come to her and says that if Raju comes close to her, she will go out
 is se pehle donon main bahes huyi thi or rozi ne marco ko yaad kar kaha tha ki shaayad marco thik kahata tha ki mard ko aurat kii aamadani main nahin jeena chaiye
 In response, Raju says that it is Rosie's misconception that she has become a star on her own and Raju also has a big hand in making her a star
 kuch samay baad rozi ko jaalsaaji kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Raju gets a two-year sentence
 rozi ko yah samaj nahin aata he ki raju ne jaalsaaji kyon kii jabaki vah rozi se sidhe paise maang saktaa he
 Raju had taken such a step in Rosie's love, not for the sake of money, because he did not want to let Marco and Rosie meet
 ab film vartmaan main laut aati he
 On the day of Raju's release, Rosie and Raju's mother come to take him to jail but they find that Raju has been released six months ago due to good conduct
 rozi or raju kii maan apane manmutav mitaa dete hai
 After being released, Raju wanders alone
 garibi, niraashaa, bhukh or akelepan ke kaaran vah idhar-udhar bhatakta he
 One day he falls asleep in the compound of the old temple of a small village with a group of sadhus and the next day a monk buries a yellow robber over Raju before he leaves the temple
 agle din gaanv kaa ek kisaan, bholaa, pitambar vastra main sote huye raju ko sadhu samaj letaa he
 Bhola's sister insisted not to marry
 bholaa use raju ke paas laata he or raju use samajha-bujhaakar shaadi ke liye raji kar letaa he
 Bhola becomes even more convinced that Raju is a monk
 vah yah baat saare gaanv main failaa detaa he
 The villagers consider him a saint and bring food and other gifts for him and also tell him their problems
 ab raju us gaanv main swami ji ke naam se janaa jane lagata he or gaanv ke panditon se uske matbhed bhi ho jate hai
 While narrating a story to the villagers, Raju tells them about a monk that once there was a famine in a village and that monk kept a fast for 12 days and it rained in that village
 sanyog se us gaanv ke ilaake main bhi akaal pad jaataa he
 a fool of the village listens to something else during a conversation with Raju and tells the villagers that Swamiji has decided to fast for 12 days for the rain
 raju pashopesh main pad jaataa he
 At first, Raju opposes it
 vah bholaa ko yahan tak bataata he ki vah ek sazaayaftaa mujrim he jise ek ladki ke kaaran sazaa mili he
 But still the villagers do not lose faith in him and he gives the example of the infamous bandit Ratnakar, who later became famous as Valmiki
 antat raju upwas ke liye raji ho jaataa he haalanki use vishwaas nahin hota ki manushya ke upwas rakhane main or varsha hone main koi sambandh he
 But during the fast, Raju's spiritual development takes place and his fame spreads far and wide
 hazaron kii sankhya main darshanaathi usase aashirwad lene aane lagate hai
 Hearing her fame, Rosie, her mother and her friend Ghafoor also visit him
 gaffoor ko bholaa mandir ke andar aane nahin detaa he kyonki vah duusare dharm kaa he
 Raju intervenes and says that his religion is humanity, love and philanthropy
 dhire-dhire raju kii haalat najuk hoti jaati he
 Finally it rains on the twelfth day but Raju dies
 jahaan ek ore mandir ke baahar gaanv vaale khushi se jhum rahe hai vahiin duusari ore mandir ke andar uske swajan uski mrityu kaa matam manaate hai

 Bhuvan, a resident of Champaner village, is an enthusiastic and idealistic youngster
 madhya pranto kii angrez chhavnee ke senapati, captain rassal ke saath uski nahi banati thi
 When the British ordered to collect the year's revenue, then the villagers went to the British camp with Bhuvan to beg Raja Puran Singh to forgive the rent
 vahaan raja, british afasaron kaa cricket kaa khel dekh rahe the
 When an officer abused a villager, Bhuvan quarreled with the officers and equaled the game of cricket with gilli-danda
 raja ke samaksh bhuvan ne kathor lagaan ke kilaaf apana virodh darj kiya
 Captain Russell did not like this and challenged Bhuvan to play cricket
 jite to salbhar kaa lagaan maaf, haare to lagaan tiguna!!! gaanvvaale to is chunauti mukarana chaahate the, magar captain rassal ne ye faisalaa sirf bhuvan ke haathon main saunpa
 To increase the challenge further, he also gave the greed to forgive the three-year rent
 bhuvan ne maidan par dwandv kaa nyotaa sweekaar kar liya
 Now as if Champaner wanted to crucify Bhuvan
 sabaki zindagi to ab tabah hone ja rahi thi
 But for Bhuvan, so long as i breath
 kai saalon se sookhaa chal rahaa tha
 After all, where would you have paid even a year's rent? And then even Captain Russell was not going to be challenged
 agavaani karte huye bhuvan ne lakdi kaa balla or gend banaae
 Except for a group of few people, the whole village was laughing at the game of Bhuvan
 cricket seekhney yah dal chori chupe chhavnee par jane laga
 There, Captain Rasel's sister Elizabeth saw him hiding in the bushes
 use apane bhai kaa gaanvvasiyon se vyavhaar pasand nahin aayaa
 She started teaching crickets to the village players on the field near the village
 hindi bhashaantar ke liye ek naukar bhi chhavnee se apane saath le aati
 Gradually, spontaneously, this team of Bhuvan started learning the game of cricket in its own unique way
 haath majboot karne ve lakdi katate
 The field learners followed the hens and caught them
 goli apane haath pawan chakki kii tarah ghuma gendbaazi karne laga
 Now the people of the village also started showing enthusiasm and Akhir became ten players

 Garbage was the untouchable cleaning servant of the village
 lautaate vakt usne gend is tarah ghumaakar phanki kii bhuvan dang rah gaya
 The village team got the eleventh selection
 magar gaanv vaale ek achhut ko kis tarah apanaate? ve to use choote tak nahin
 Bhuvan criticized the village and this tradition, which lasted for centuries
 bhuvan ke bhav bhare shabdon se gaanv ke nivasi maan gaye
 Finally the day of combat woke up
 saare praant se log khel dekhne aae
 Captain Rasal's senior officer was also present
 khel teen dino kaa nishchit kiya gaya tha
 The villagers first started throwing the ball

 Suddenly the garbage ball kept rolling
 lakh ne to kai kach bhi gawaae
 At the end of the first day, the white group was dominating
 us raat olizabath ne chhavnee main lakh ko captain rasal se milte dekh liya
 Now it was found that Lakha was cheating from the villagers
 olizabath gaanvvasiyon ko cricket kii talim detii thi yah baat captain rasal ko bataa di
 It was also told that he also lost the catch deliberately
 jab gaanvvasiyon ko pataa chalaa to lakh kii khaal oodhedna chahte the
 Lakha escaped from them and took refuge in the village temple
 lakh ne kubul kiya kii bhuvan se jalan ke kaaran usne yah dhokhebaazi kii
 He also wanted Gauri like Bhuvan but Gauri liked Bhuvan
 ek mauka or lakh ko diya gaya
 The next day Lakha made tremendous catches
 kachra bhi apana jaadu phir chalaane laga
 He took three wickets in three balls simultaneously
 goron kii pari kareeb tinsau ran par samaapt hui
 Bhuvan's team started the batting vigorously
 british sena ke bhootpurv sipaahi deva kamanaseebi se out ho gayi
 Then the British players condemned the village batsmen and threw them out and they soon started getting out
 doosraa din khatm hua or aadhe ran banane abhi baaki the
 Meanwhile, half the team was out
 magar bhuwan abhi khel me jivit tha
 On the third day Baid Ishwar Kaka of the village and Ismail supported Bhuvan
 ismail ko to pichle din chot lagi thi
 Both batted very strongly
 dono ran-out ho gayi
 Now the garbage took the bat
 bhuvan ne bahut koshish kii ki zyaada ballebaazi vahi sanbhale
 The trash required six runs on the last ball
 magar vah ek hi ran le paaya
 Are the villagers losers? The umpire made a no-ball gesture
 ab ek or gend kaa samana bhuvan ne jhela
 Bhuvan hit a six and the village prevailed
 or saath hi barsaat bhi shuru hui
 Captain Russell was sent by his superiors to Central Africa
 olizabath landhan lauti
 Weeping wept farewell to the weeping Bhuvan and the people of the village
