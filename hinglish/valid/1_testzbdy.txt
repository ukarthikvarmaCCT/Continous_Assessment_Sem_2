isamen 'arth kii punrariti hoti hai, shabd kii nahin
 The etymological meaning of the word 'translation' means 'transit' means to move from one place point to another
 yah sthaan-bindu bhashik paath he
 In this too, the object to be carried has meaning, not the word
 uparyukt donon shabdon main antar vyutpattimulak arth kii drushti se he, atah satahi he
 The similarity of the two is evident in actual practice
 arth kii punrariti ko hi duusare shabdon main or prakaaraantar se, arth kaa bhashaantaran kaha jaataa he, jisamen kai baar mul bhashaa kii roopaatmak-gathnaatmak visheshtaayen lakshyabhasha main sakrant ho jaati he
 In fact, the Indian tradition meaning of the word 'translation' is also valid in modern context and the nature of translation is partly understood by making it the focal point
 tadnusaar, anuwaad kaary ke teen sandarbh hai - sambhashik, anybhashik or antarasanketaparak
 In the linguistic context, the repetition of meaning occurs within the same language range, but its dimensions vary
 mukhya aayam do hai -kalkramik or samakalik
 On the chronological dimension, linguistic translation occurs in two adjacent stages of historical development of the same language, eg, translation from old Hindi to modern Hindi
 samakalik aayam par sambhashik anuwaad mukhya rup se teen staron par hota he - boli, style or madhyam
 There can be four sub-levels of bilingual translation at the dialect level: ek bhugolic boli se duusari bhugolic boli main; jaise braj se avadhi main
 From non-standard dialect to standard dialect; For example, Ganjam from Oriya to Puri or from Nagpur Marathi to Pune Marathi
 boli rup se bhashaa rup main, jaise braj yaa avadhi se hindi main From one social dialect to another social dialect, such as from the language of the uneducated or under-educated to the language of the educated or from the language of the people initiated in one religion from the language of the people initiated in the other religion
 style str par sambhashik anuwaad ko style-vikalpan ke rup main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 a good example of this is the translation from formal style to informal style; Like 'smoking is forbidden' → 'smoking cigarette smoking is prohibited'
 isi prakaar ‘tubey vaayu aadhaan main samamiti nahin rah gai
 Is' -> 'tire air has gone out'
 madhyam kii drushti se sambhashik anuwaad kii sthiti vahaan hoti he jahaan maukhik madhyam main prastut sandesh kii likhit madhyam main yaa iske vipareet punrariti kii jaae; jaise, maukhik madhyam kaa kaa ek vaakya he : "samay kii seemaa ke kaaran main apane shrotaaon ko adhik vistaar se is vishay main nahin bataa paaoonga
 "it is probably considered appropriate to say in the written medium in this way:" Due to the limitation of space, i will not be able to explain this topic in more detail to my readers
 " 
 The above examples of linguistic translation make two things clear
 arthantaran yaa arth kii punrariti kii prakriya main shabdachayan tathaa vaakya-vinyas donon prabhavit hote hai
 In medium translation, the characteristics of the phonation process take the form of characteristics of the written system or vice versa
 boli, style, or madhyam ke ayaamon ke madhya kathor vibhaajan rekha nahin, api tu inamen aanshik ativyapti pai jaati he, jisaki sambhaavna bhashaa prayog kii pravriti main hi nihit he
 As such, the partial power of stylistic translation is reflected in the medium translation, and accordingly 'to be able to explain the subject' as in the oral medium, so informal, selective, taking a touch of formality in the written medium becomes 'clarifying'
 is
 isi prakaar shailigat anuwaad main samaajik boligat anuwaad bhi kabhi-kabhi samavisht ho jaataa he
 For example, in the dialect of the educated, the formal style may have a tendency to predominance, and in the dialect of the under-educated or uneducated, the informal style may be
 sambhashik anuwaad kii samasyaayen na keval rochak hai api tu anybhashik anuwaad kii drushti se mahatvapurn bhi hai
 The importance of linguistic translation becomes even more evident when translation is seen as a mode of linguistics
 iske atirikt anybhashik anuwaad kii prakruti ko samajhane kii drushti se sambhashik anuwaad kii prakruti ko samajhnaa na keval sahaayak he, api tu aavashyak bhi he
 It can be said that translation is derived language, which has two references - bilingual and dialectical
 is sandarbh bhed se anuwaad vyavhaar main antar aa jaataa he, parantu donon hi sthitiyon main anuwaad kii prakruti vahi rahati he
 The other language translation occurs between two languages
 ye do bhashaayen aitihaasikta or kshetreeyata ke samanvit mandand par swatantra bhashaaon ke rup main pahachaani jaati hai
 Historically, languages coming in the same stream are generally seen as independent languages in that case if they are not closely embedded in chronology, such as Sanskrit and Hindi; Prakrit languages come between these two
 isi prakaar kshetreeyata kii drushti se prativeshi bhashaaon main atyadhik aadan-pradaan hone par bhi unhen bhinn bhashaayen hi maananaa hoga, jaise hindi or punjabi
 In the context of other languages translation, the independent existence of the respective languages is a matter of importance
 sambhashik anuwaad kii tulana main anybhashik anuwaad saamaajik or vyaavhaarik drushti se adhik mahatvapurn he
 From the point of view of linguistic, there is a qualitative difference between problems of linguistic translation from problems of linguistic translation
 is prakaar sambhashik anuwaad se sambandhit hote hue bhi anybhashik anuwaad, apekshaakrit swanishtha vyapaar he
 Both of the above references to the word translation are relatively limited
 inamen anuwaad ko bhashaa-sanketon kaa vyapaar mana gaya he
 In fact, language-socket is a special category of symbols, through which communication work is done
 sampreshan ke liye vibhinn kotiyon ke sanketon ko kaam main liya jaataa he
 These are called common figures
 is drushti se bhi anuwaad shabd kii paribhaasha kii jaati he
 According to this, the reiteration of what is said by one sign by another category of signs, this type of translation is called intertextual translation
 yah saamaanya sanket vigyaan ke antargat he
 The signs are divided into linguistic and linguistic, with linguistic signals considered to be the focal point
 bhashetar main do bhaag hai - bahya or aantarik 
 From the translation point of view, the following categories of sign-exchange business can be made: 1
 bahya sanket kaa bahya sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi desh kaa maanchitr us desh kaa anuwaad he; kisi praani kaa chitra us praani kaa anuwaad he
 2
 Translation of external signs into linguistic signs - According to this, any word used in a language for a creature is a translation of that creature
 is drushti se vastutah yaha bhashaa darshan kii samasya he jisaki vyakhya arth ke sanket siddhanth main kii gai he
 3
 Translation from internal signal to internal signal - According to this, translating any event into its sensory sensation is translation of this category
 spasht he ki is sthiti kii vaastavik satta nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, this category is determined only from the point of view of theory
 4
 aantarik sanket se bhashik sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi aantarik samvednaa ke liye kisi shabd kaa prayog karnaa is koti kaa anuwaad he
 It is said more clearly that, upon contact with a physical condition - eg, seeing an accident, looking at a view of nature, putting an arm on an object, smelling something; In other words, the sense of sensation that arises in the mind is a kind of sign - when the senses are in proximity
 uske liye bhashaa ke kisi shabd kaa prayog karnaa yaa bhashik sanket dwaara uski punrariti karnaa is koti kaa anuwaad kehalaayegaa
 For example, the word 'mourning' is used in Hindi to indicate a specific type of anguish and for another the word 'love'
 samajha jaataa he ki ek samvednaa kaa anuwaad ‘shok' shabd dwaara kiya jaataa he or duusari kaa 'prem' dwaara
 From this point of view it is said that the entire fundamental expression is translation
 vaktaa yaa lekhak apane samvednaa rupi sanketon kii bhashik sanketon main punrariti kar detaa he
 From this point of view, it is the problem of language psychology, which is explained in the stimulus-response theory
 is prakaar, anuwaad shabd kii vyapak paridhi main teenon sandarbhon ke anuwaadon kaa sthaan he -sambhashik anuwaad, anybhashik anuwaad, or antarasanketaparak anuwaad
 All three have their own theoretical basis
 in teenon ke madhya kaa bhed jaananaa mahatvapurn he
 The translator has to fix who is the central position among these three and how the remaining two have relation with them
 saiddhanthik auchity kii drushti se anybhashik anuwaad kii sthiti kendriya he
 Only by the word 'translation' is the meaning of the dialectical translation
 iskaa mul he dwibhashabaddhata
 In both the interpretation and expression of the translator, languages are tied to the language and these languages also differ not in terms of distinction, but in terms of code; Such as Hindi and English, Hindi and Sindhi etc
 is kendriya sthiti ke do chor hai
 On the first end, there is linguistics in both cases, but the language remains the same
 sthitiyon ko antar usee bhashaa ke bhedon ke antar par aadhaarit hota he
 This is an equilateral translation
 paribhaashik shabdon ke prayog kii spashtataa ke liye ise 'anvayaantar' yaa 'shabdaantaran' kaha jaataa he
 At the other end, there is a change in the linguistic signal to the language
 sanket paddati kaa yah parivartan bhashaa prayog kii saamaanya sthiti ko janm detaa he
 In terminology it is called 'language practice'
 in teenon main sambandh tathaa antar donon hai
 This relationship is common
 anuwaad kii drushti se mahatvapurn baat yah he ki vaastavik anuwaad kaary main tathaa anudit paath ke moolyankan main anuvaadakon ko sambhashik anuwaad tathaa antarasanketaparak anuwaad kii sankalpanaaon se sahaayta milti he
 This requirement comes out clearly only when the translator is stuck while doing the translation - the original text is unable to be understood, it is difficult to adequately explore the pure and appropriate translation in the target language, the translator would have to check it How successful the translation is, etc
 pravritimulak main 'anuwaad' shabd se anybhashik anuwaad kaa hi arth liya jaataa he
 And for this reason, Shanai: Shanai: It has also become a matter of principle that translation is a process between two languages
 is sthiti kaa sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 The word 'chhaya' in Sanskrit tradition is used to indicate this situation
 anuwaad ke swaroop ko samajhane ke liye anuwaad kii paribhaasha vishesh rup se sahaayak he
 Given the multilaterality of translation, the definition of translation has been presented from various perspectives
 mukhya drushtikon teen prakaar ke hai - anuwaad ek prakriya he
 Translation is a process or / and its result
 anuwaad ek sambandh kaa naam he
 The following definitions are cited under this approach: "mulbhasha ke sandesh ke samamoolya sandesh ko lakshyabhasha main prastut karne kii kriya ko anuwaad kehete hai
 This value of messages is first in terms of meaning and then style, and is near and natural
 " "translation is the process by which meaningful experiences are communicated from one language-community to another
 " "installing the text of one language by synonyms of another language is called translation
 " "translation is a craft in which an attempt is made to present the same message in another language instead of a message written in one language
 " The following written definition is cited under this: "ek bhashaa yaa bhashabhed se duusari bhashaa yaa bhashabhed main pratipaadya ko sthaanantarit karne kii prakriya yaa uske parinaam ko anuwaad kehete hai
 " iske antargat nimnlikhit paribhaasha aati he : "translation is a relation between two or more texts; these texts perform the same function in the same situation
" " While this classification of translation definitions explains the multilaterality of the nature of translation, it also indicates that, definitions of translation can also vary according to different purposes
 is prakaar ye sabhi paribhaashaayen maanya hai
 Based on these definitions, two sides of translation are considered
 anuwaad ke do paksh hai - pehla sankriyaatmak paksh at ev gatisheel or doosraa saiddhanthik paksh at ev sthitisheel
 In operational terms, translation is a process
 anuwaad ke paksh kaa sambandh anuwaad karne ke kaary se he jiske liye 'anuwaad kaary' shabd kaa prayog karnaa uchit mana jaataa he
 In theory, translation is a relationship between two or more languages, but between texts in different languages; But they should be synonyms
 is sambandh kaa udghaatan tulanaatmak paddati ke adhyayan se kiya jaataa he
 The coordinated form of these two is found in the assumption that translation is an abstraction - the result of work is translation - which is related to the relation of synonymy to its original text
 nishpatti ke rup main anuwaad ko 'anudit paath' kaha jaataa he
 In this view, there can be many translations of an original text
 is prakaar sankriyaatmak drushti se anuwaad ko jahaan bhashaa prayog kii ek vidha ke rup main janaa jaataa he, vahaan saiddhanthik drushti se iskaa sambandh bhashaa paath tulana tathaa vyatireki vishleshan kii takneekon par aadhaarit bhashaa sambandhon ke prashn se joda jaataa he
 Translation has been called the branch of applied linguistics
 vastutah, apane is rup main yah apane prakriya rup tathaa sambandh rup paribhaashaon kii yojak kadi he, jiskaa sankriyaatmak aadhaar anudit paath he, jiske mul main 'anuwaad ek nishpatti he' kii dharna nihit he
 The other information about the translation from these definitions is as follows: anuwaad ek bhashaa yaa bhashabhed se duusari bhashaa yaa bhashaa bhed main hota he
 It is of the nature of process, change, transfer, replacement, or repetition
 sthaanantarit hone vaali vastu ko vibhinn naamon se ingit kar sakate hai, jaise paathyasaamagree, sarthak anubhav, soochna, sandesh
 These different names are related to the difference between the various ions of the theoretical background of translation and the objectives of the translation work
 jaise, bhashaagat 'paathyasaamagree' naam se vyakt hone vaali sunishchitata anuwaad ke bhashavaigyanik aadhaar kii visheshta he, jiskaa vishesh upyog mashin anuwaad main hota he
 'information' and 'meaningful experience' indicate the sociocultural basis of translation; And 'sandesh' provides the textual background of the translation
 uparyukt kii visheshta yah hoti he ki iskaa donon bhashaaon main samaan arth hota he
 This similarity of meaning is broad-based and extends from linguistic meaning to contextual meaning
 sankshep main, ek bhashaa ke vishisht bhashabhed ke vishisht paath ko duusari bhashaa main is prakaar prastut karnaa anuwaad he, jisamen vah mul ke bhashik arth, prayog ke vaishishty se nishpann arth, prayukti or style kii visheshta, vishaywastu, tathaa sambaddh saanskrithik vaishashtyi ko yathasambhav sangrakshit rakhte hue duusari bhashaa ke pathak ko swaabhaavik rup se grahya prathit ho
 The twentieth century has been called the era of translation
 yadhyapi anuwaad sabase pracheen vyavsaay yaa vyavsaayon main se ek kehalaata he tathaapi uske jo mahatva beesvin sadi main praapt hua vah usase pehle use nahin mila aisa mana jaataa he
 The main reason for this is that it is only in the twentieth century that linguistic contact, that is, the status of contact started in different linguistic communities
 iske mul kaaran aarthik or raajnneetik maane jate hai
 As a result, the economic-political map of the world began to change
 vartmaan yag main adhiktar rashtron main yadi ek bhashaa pradhan he to ek yaa adhik bhashaayen gaun pad par dikhaai detii hai
 In other words, there are linguistic majorities and linguistic minorities within the same political-administrative unit boundary
 loktantr main sab logon kaa prashasan main samaan rup se bhaag lene kaa adhikaar tabhi sarthak mana jaataa he, jab unke saath unki bhashaa ke madhyam se sampark kiya jaae
 This creates a state of multilingualism and it becomes mandatory to take shelter of translation work in the process of its preservation
 iske atirikt anterrashtriya str par vibhinn rashtron ke bich raajnneetik, aarthik, vaigyanik or praudyogic, tathaa saahitiyik or saanskrithik str par badhate hue aadan-pradaan ke kaaran anuwaad kaary kii anivaaryta or mahatta kii nai chetana prabal rup se viksit hoti hui dikhti he
 Therefore, translation is considered to be a comprehensive and often mandatory and rational position
 anuwaad ke mahatva ko do bhinn, parantu sambandhit sandarbho main adhik spashtataa se samajhayaa jaataa he : saamaajik evam vyaavhaarik mahatva, shaikshanik evam gyanatmak mahatva
 In a social context, translation trade takes place in informal situations
 iskaa sambandh dwibhashikta kii sthiti se he
 Bilingualism generally means alternately using two languages at a time
 vartmaan yug ke samaaj kaa ek brihad bhaag aisa he, jo saamaajik sandarbh kii anaupchaarik sthiti main do bhashaaon kaa vaikalpik prayog karata he
 Normally every educated person, semi-educated person of the urban environment, people living in the border region of two different linguistic states, and linguistic minorities, more clearly see the status of bilingualism
 yah dwibhashikta praayah ashrith / sanyukt dwibhashikta kii koti kii hoti he
 The common feature of this is that, everyone thinks in one language, but expresses it in another language
 is sthiti main anuwaad prakriya kaa hona anivaary he
 But this process takes place informally
 vyakti man hi man pehali bhashaa se anya bhashaa main anuwaad kar apni baat kah dete hai
 It has been assumed that translation directly exists when learning another language in another language environment
 yadi swa-bhashaa ke hi parivesh main anya bhashaa sikhi jaae to "code" parivartan kii sthiti aati he, jisamen anuwaad kii sthiti kuch paroksh ho jaati he
 Hence all translations in bilingual form are informal
 is drushti se anuwaad ek saamaajik bhashaa vyavhaar main mahatvapurn bhoomika main dikhataa he
 The translation business takes place in a formal position in academic and cognitive context
 iske do bhed hai : saadhan rup main anuwaad or saadhy rup main anuwaad
 Translation in the form of instrument is used as a method of language teaching
 sangyanatmak kaushal ke rup main anuwaad ke abhyaas se bhashaa adhigam ke do kaushalon-bodhan or abhivyakti ko pusht kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, there are two more areas of translation in means: comparative study of languages and comparative literature discussion
 vastutah bhashaaon ke adhyayan-vishleshan ke liye anuwaad ke dwaara hi vyakti ko yah gyaat hota he ki, ek vaakya main kis shabd kaa kya arth he
 Only after that does he become aware of the point of equality and inequality in both
 atah vyatireki bhashaa vishleshan ko anuvaadatmak vishleshan bhi kaha gaya he
 Comparative literature interpretation refers to the use of translation as a means of comparative study of literatures, so that fractions can be compared
 iske atirikt anya bhashaa sahitya kii kritiyon ke anuwaad kaa abhyaas karnaa athwa / or unhen anudit rup main padhanaa tulanaatmak sahitya vivechan main anuwaad ke yogadan kaa udhaaharan he
 The translation business, as practicable, appears in many fields
 koshkarya bhi uk prakaar kaa anuwaad kaary he
 a bilingual dictionary contains translation within a single language and a bilingual dictionary between two languages
 yah anuwaad, paath kii apeksha bhashaa ke aayam par hota he, jisamen bhashaa vishleshan ke do str prabhavit hote hai
 They are two levels - word and word series
 isi prakaar kisi bhashaa ke vikaas ke liye bhi anuwaad-vyapaar kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 When a language has an opportunity to work in areas that were not previously used, it needs to be developed from both a content and a method of expression
 iske liye anya bhashaaon se vibhinn prakaar ke sahitya kaa usamen anuwaad kiya jaataa he
 Consequently, with the expansion of the perimeter of the content, the area of the lexicon of the language also expands
 anek naye shabd ban jate hai, kai baar prachlit shabdon ko nayaa arth mil jaataa he, naye sahprayog viksit hone lagate hai, sankar-shabdaawalee prayog main aane lagati he, or bhashaa prayog ke sandarbh kii visheshta ke kaaran kul milakar bhashaa kaa ek naveen bhed viksit ho jaataa he
 Modern administrative Hindi and journalistic Hindi are good examples of this
 is prakriya ko bhashaa niyojan or bhashaa vikaas kehete hai, jo apane vyapaktar sandarbh main raashtra ke saamaajik-aarthik vikaas kaa ang he
 Thus through translation, necessary and important literature enters the developing language
 tab kah sakate hai ki is rup main anuwaad rashtriya vikaas main bhi yogadan karata he
 Translation in its widest form enhances the power of language, helps in the interpretation and interpretation of texts, clarifies the relationship between language and thought, propagates knowledge, is a conduit of culture, and mutual degradation between nations
 And contributes to the growth of harmony
 gete ke shabdon main, anuwaad asambhav hote hue bhi aavashyak tathaa mahatvapurn he
 There are two notable aspects of the nature of translation - coordination and balance
 anuwaad siddhanth kaa bahuvidyaparak aayam iskaa samanvayshil paksh he
 Accordingly, although the basic origin of translation theory is applied comparative textology, yet some other scriptures touch upon it
 'tulanaatmak' se anuwaad kaa do bhashaaon se sambandhit hona spasht hi he, jisamen bhashaaon kii samanta-asamanta ke prashn upasthit hote hai
 The three aspects of textual science - semantics, syntax and contextualism - are relevant to translation theory
 arthvichaar main bhashik sanket tathaa bhashaabahya yatharth ke bich main sambandh kaa adhyayan hota he
 The status of linguistics under contextualism refers to the various dimensions of the context - the social identity of the speaker and the listener, the purpose of linguistics and the speaker towards the message - the attitude of the listener, the physical conditions of linguistics and the expression, medium, etc
 spasht he ki sanketavigyaan kii paridhi bhashavigyaan kii apeksha vyapaktar he tathaa anuwaad kaary jaise vyapak sampreshan vyapaar ke adhyayan ke upyukt he
 The scripture that touches the translation principle is the communication principle, according to which the translation work is a communication business, and accordingly all the things that apply to it are in the nature of communication business, such as 100% of the communication is not true, imperfection , Ecstasy, partial artificiality etc
 isi se anuwaad kaary main shabd-prati-shabd tathaa arth-prati-arth samanta ke sthaan par sandesstareey samanta kaa auchity bhi saadhaa ja saktaa he
 From a operational point of view, a text or speech is the starting point of translation work
 ek paath kii apni sanrachana hoti he, bhashik sansakti tathaa sandesgat subaddhata kii sankalpanaaon dwaara uske sugathit athwa shithil hone kii jaanch kar sakate hai
 In addition, considering a text as a unified whole of linguistics, it provides more definite information about the linguistic functional distribution of language-use styles
 isi se sambandhit shaastra he, samajabhashashastra tathaa shailivigyaan, jisamen saamaajik boliyon tathaa prayuktiyon ke adhyayan ke saath sandarbhanukool bhashaprayog kii shailion ke vitaran kii jaankaree anuwaad siddhanth ke liye vaanchhneeya he
 Being connected to the language, logic and linguistics also confirm the translation principle
 tarkshastra ke anusaar anudit paath ke satyamulya kii pariksha anuwaad kii vishuddhta ko shuddh karne kaa aadhaar he
 Meaningful thinking in linguistics helps in understanding problems related to the transfer or repetition of meaning in translation work
 vitgenstin kii manyata 'bhashaa main shabd kaa 'prayog' hi uskaa arth he'
 The translation theory is particularly relevant for the reason that the text itself is the unit of translation work, which is the first requirement for successful semantic translation
 is prakaar vaktaa kii vivaksha main arth kaa mul khojna, bhashik arth tathaa bhashaabahya sthiti anuwaad siddhanth ke aavashyak ang hai
 While the above assumptions have a role in the transfer of meaning, the special utility of the method of subtractive analysis has been accepted in the determination of semantic bilingual equality
 yah baat vishesh rup se dhyaan main lee jaati he ki jahaan vividh shastron kii praasangik manyataon se anuwaad siddhanth kaa swaroop nirmit he, vahaan swayan anuwaad siddhanth un shastron kaa ek vishisht ang he
 Translation is also the 'general' aspect of the theory and also the specific aspect, and it is its equilibrium form - the balance of the general and the specific
 anuwaad kii paribhaasha ke anusaar kaha jaataa he ki anuwaad vyavahaaratah vishisht bhashabhed ke str par tathaa isiilie siddhantatah saamaanya bhashaa ke str par hota he - angreji bhashaa ke ek bhed patrakarita kii angreji se hindi bhashaa ke samamoolya bhed patrakarita kii hindi main
 Accordingly, translation is both a general aspect and a specific aspect of translation theory
 ham jo baat saamaanya ke str par kehete hai, use vyaavhaarik rup main bhashabhed ke vishisht str par udaahrit karte hai
 'determining a suitable and common translation system for as many text types as possible' is considered a pertinent question in the field of translation
 pranali ke nirdhaaran ke sambandh main anuwaad prakriya kii prakruti, anuwaad ke vibhinn prakaar, anuwaad ke sutara tathaa vibhinn koti ke paathon ke anuwaad ke nirdesh nishchit karne ke praaroop kaa nirdhaaran, aadi par vichaar karnaa hota he
 The main purpose of translation, unit of translation, nature of art-skills of translation, limitations of translation work, etc
 are some other subjects, which require consideration
 anuwaad kaary kaa merudand he mulbhasha paath
 Theoretical discussion and determination of its operational structure in relation to its structure, its type, the format of the text according to the linguistic format, etc
, along with semantics and various formats of analytical comprehension of grammatical structure, assessment of their strengths and limitations, etc
 , Are the main points under it
 anuwaad siddhanth ke hi antargat kuch gaun binduon kii charchaa bhi hoti he - roopak, vyaktivaachak sangyaayen, paribhaashik shabd, adyakshar shabd, bhugolic naam, vyapaarik naam, vyavsaayik pratishthanon ke naam, saanskrithik shabd, aadi ke anuwaad ke liye koun-si pranali apanaai jaae; saahitiyik rachanaaon, vaigyanik or praudyogikeey lekhan, prachaar sahitya aadi ke liye anuwaad pranali kaa rup kya ho, ityadi
 There is an important point related to this, various tips of translation - transliteration, word-to-word translation, concordant translation, input translation, interpretation, elaboration, interpretation, cultural synonym, interpreting, etc
 anuwaad kaa kaam antatogatva ek hi vyakti karata he
 In solitary translation, the translator is alone, even in collaborative translation, in the last period, the work of editing is done by the translator alone
 atah anuvadak ke saath anek daayitv jud jate hai or kaary ke safal nishpaadan main usase anek apekshaayen rahati hai
 In terms of language knowledge, subject knowledge, expression skills, personal qualities, etc
, the expectations from the translator have to be considered
 anuwaad shiksha or anuwaad samiksha, do anya mahatvapurn bindu hai
 Translation education can be imparted as a means of language-learning, especially other language learning
 isamen anuwaad shikshan, bhashaa-shikshan ke adheen he tathaa ek madhyavarti alpakaalik abhyaskram main isaki yojana kii jaati he, jisamen shikshan ke sopan tathaa lakshya bindu spasht tathaa nishchit hote hai
 The learner's goal in this is to learn the language, not to translate
 shiksha ke duusare charan main anuwaad kaa abhyaas, anuwaad ko ek shilp yaa kaushal ke rup main seekhney ke liye kiya jaataa he, jisaki pragat avasthaa 'anuwaad kala he' kii shabdaawalee main nirdisht kii jaati he
 In this case, the language which is not the translator's own, also confirms his learning in a casual way
 abhyaas saamagree ke rup main paath prakaaron kii vividhta tathaa kathinaayee kii maatra ke anusaar paathon kaa anustaran karnaa hota he
 If there is an aim to develop the ability to translate a homogeneous / heterogeneous, indigenous or foreign language into or from a scheme of learning, then both steps of translation-learning - both instrumental and practicable - can be seen as unconstrained
 anuwaad samiksha, anuwaad siddhanth kaa aisa ang he, jiskaa shithil rup main vyavhaar, anudit kriti kaa ek saamaanya pathak bhi karata he, parantu jisaki ek paryaapt spasht saiddhanthik prishthbhumi he
 Theoretical translation review is a cognitive tradeoff
 isamen ek mulpath ke ek yaa ek se adhik anuwaadon kii samiksha kii jaati he, tathaa mul kii tulana main anuwaad kaa yaa mul ke vibhinn anuwaadon kaa parsparik tulana dwaara moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 It has three steps - an analysis of both the original language text and the target language text, a comparison of the two, and finally an evaluation of translation in terms of target language accuracy, appropriateness and naturalness
 moolankan ke sopan par anuwaad kii safalataa kii jaanch ke liye vibhinn pareekshan takneekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The mindset of accepting translation as both an art and a science has grown due to the fact that attempts at mutual translation of languages around the world point to many styles and methods of translation
 anuwaad kii ek bhangima to yahi he ki kisi rachana kaa saahitiyik-vidha ke aadhaar par anuwaad upasthit kiya jaae
 If a play is to be translated as a play, then in such translations, the translator's own creative talent is also required
 anuwaad kaa ek aadhaar anuwaad ke gadyatmak athwa padyatmak hone par bhi ashrith he
 It is found that most of the translation of prose is present in prose or verse itself, but sometimes this sequence seems to have changed
 kai gadhy kritiyon ke padyanuwaad milte hai, to kai kavyakritiyon ke gadyanuwaad bhi uplabdh hai
 Translations are also categorized on the basis of subject and on many levels it is also divided into two categories, original-focused and original-free, depending on the nature of the translation
 anuwaad ke jin sarthak or prachlit prabhedon kaa ullekh anuwaad vigyaniyon ne kiya he, unamem shabdanuwaad, bhavanuaad, chhayanuwaad, saranuwaad, vyakhyanuwaad, ashyanuwaad or roopantaran ko sarvaadhik sweekruti mili he
 The translation of every word of the source language into every word in the target language is called transliteration
 'makshika sthane makshika' par aadhaarit shabdanuwaad vastav main anuwaad kii sabase nikrusht koti kaa parichaayak hota he
 The nature of each language is different from other language and in every language there are many meanings of the word
 isiilie mul bhashaa kii har shabdabhivyakti ko yathavat lakshyabhasha main nahin anuvaadit kiya ja saktaa
 Sometimes such ridiculous situations arise
 sanskrit se hindi main kiye gayi anuwaad ko kai baar prakruti kii samyata ke kaaran sahya hote hai, lekin europea parivaar kii bhashaaon se kiye gaye anuwaad main arth or padakram ke dosha saamanytah najar aate hai
 In fact, if the source and the target language are similar in meaning, use, syntax, and style, then only eloquence is correct, otherwise the mechanized eloquence becomes ludicrous, funny and artificial
 aise anuvaadakon main strot-bhashaa ke shabd, padakram or vaakya-vinyas par dhyaan na dekar anuwaad mulbhasha kii vichaar-saamagree yaa bhavadhaara par apane aapako kendrit karata he
 The goal of the translator is to present the contents of the source language in such translations
 bhavanuaad kii prakriya main kabhi-kabhi mul rachana jaisaa moulik vaibhav aa jaataa he, lekin kai baar pathakon ko yah shikaayat hoti he ki anuvadak ne mulbhasha kii bhavadhaara ko samajhe bina, lakshya-bhashaa kii prakruti ke anuroop bhav saamagree prastut kar di he
 When a reader wants to read a work from the point of view of the expression skills of the creator, then paraphrasing is not helpful in its goal achievement
 sanskrit naatakon main lagaataar aise prayog milte hai ki unki stra-paatra tathaa sevak, daasi aadi jis praakrit bhashaa kaa prayog karte hai, uski sanskrit chaaya bhi naatak main vidyaman rahati he
 Chhayanuvaad has emerged from similar experiments
 anuwaad kii pravidhi ke antargat anuvadak na shabdanuwaad kii tarah keval mul shabdon kaa anusaran karata he or na sirf bhaavon kaa hi paripaalan karata he, balki mulbhasha se puri tarah bandhaa hua uski chaaya main lakshyabhasha main varnya-vishay kii prastuti karata he
 In this translation, the contents of the original language are abbreviated and shortened to the target language
 lambey bhaashanon or vaad-vivaadon ke anuwaad prastut karne main yah vidhi sahaayak hoti he
 In such translations, translation of the contents of the original language along with the interpretation in the target language is introduced
 isamen anuvadak apane adhyayan or dashshtikon ke anuroop mul bhashaa kii saamagree kii vyakhya apekshit pramaanon or udaahranon aadi ke saath karata he
 Lokmanya Tilak has translated 'geeta' in this style
 sanskrit ke bahut saare bhashyakaron or hindi ke tikaakaron ne vyakhyanuwaad kii style kaa hi anugaman kiya he
 By nature, linguism or linguism becomes much larger than the original and at many levels becomes absolutely fundamental
 jahaan anuwaad dubhashiye kii bhoomika main kaam karata he, vahaan vah keval ashyanuwaad kar paata he
 Interpreters become a medium of communication between the different languages of the two remote countries when they talk among themselves
 aise avasaron par ve anuwaad shabd or bhav kii simaaon ko todakar anuvadak kii satvar anuwaad kshamta par aadhaarit ho jaataa he
 He does not have enough time to think about the correct linguistic synonym of the word or to seek the help of the dictionary
 kai baar aise dubhashiye ke ashyanuwaad ke kaaran do deshon main tanaav kii sthiti bhi ban jaati he
 Short translation is now known as interpretation
 anuwaad ke is prabhed main anuvadak mulbhasha se lakshyabhasha main keval shabd or bhav kaa anuvaadan nahin karata, apitu apni pratibha or suvidha ke anusaar mul rachana kaa puri tarah roopantaran kar daalata he
 William Shakespeare's famous play 'merchant of Venice' has been translated by Bharatendu Harishchandra as 'rare Bandhu' meaning 'mahajan of Vanshipur', which is the best example of translation
 mul naatak ke antonio, basolio, porshia, shylock jaise naamon ko bhaaratendu ne kramshah anant, basant, purashri, shailaksh jaise roopaantar pradaan kiye hai
 The originality of translation emerges most in such a conversion
 anuvadak ke in prabhedon se gyaapit hota he ki sansar bhar kii bhashaaon main anuwaad kii kai sheliyaan or pravidhiyaan apanaai gai hai, lekin yadi anuvadak saavdhaneepurvak shabd or bhav kii aatma kaa sparsh karte hue mulbhasha kii prakruti ke anuroop lakshyabhasha main anuwaad upasthit kare to yahi adarsh anuwaad hoga
 That is why the best translator is said to be such a skilled doctor, who delivers the medicine kept in the bottle as it is in the patient's body through his syringe
 anuwaad siddhanth koi apane main swatantra, swanishtha, siddhanth nahin he or na hi yah us arth main koi ‘vigyaan' hi he, jis arth main ganitshastra, bhashashastra, samajashaastra aadi hai
 It also does not have any specific study material and study system, which is different from the study material and system of other scriptures in such a way that it can basically become an independent personality
 vastutah, yah anuwaad ke vibhinn muddon se sambandhit gyanatmak soochnaaon kaa ek nikaay he, jisase anuwaad ko ek prakriya, ek nishpatti, tathaa ek sambandh ke rup main samajhane main sahaayta milti he
 For this, the words 'translation science', 'translation science', and 'translation science' are also popular
 anuwaad, bhashaprayog sambandhi ek aisi prakriya he, jisaki ek sunishchit parinti hoti he tathaa jiske falswaroop mul evam nishpatti main 'mulya' kii drushti se samanta kaa sambandh sthapit ho jaataa he
 Thus, information about the general nature of translation as the integrated unit of process, execution, and relationship is the translation principle, which, despite not being originally collected, is collectible, interesting, informative, and to a lesser extent real for the translation work
 apane vikaas kii vartmaan avasthaa main yah bahu-vidyaparak anushaasan ban gaya he
 Whose knowledge is itself a goal and which is a source of intellectual satisfaction for the curious reader
 anuwaad siddhanth kii anuwaad kaary main upyogita kaa akalan ke samay is samayik tathy ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he ki vartmaan kaal main anuwaad ek sangathit vyavsaay ho gaya he, jisamen vyaktigat ruchi kii apeksha vyavsaayik-saamaajik aavashyaktaa se prerit prashikshanarthiyon kii sankhya adhik hoti he 
 The contribution of translation theory is demonstrated in developing proficiency in translation work especially for such people and for interested translators in general
 is yogadan kaa saiddhanthik auchity is drushti se bhi he ki anuwaad kaary sarjanaatmak hone ke kaaran hi gaun rup se samikshatmak bhi hota he 
 It is also called 'creative-critical'
 sarjanaatmakataa ko vishuddh tathaa pusht karne ke liye jo samikshatmak sphuranaayen anuvadak main hoti hai, ve anuwaad siddhanth ke gyaan se prarit hoti hai 
 Principle knowledge contributes to the accuracy of translation accuracy
 saath hi, anuwaad prakriya kii jaankaree use paryaay-chayan main adhik saavdhaanee se kaam karne main sahaayta kar sakati he 
 It is considered more important that he can avoid making silly errors
 mulpath kaa bhashik, vishyavastugat, tathaa saanskrithik mahatva kaa koi ansh anudit hone se na rah jaae, iske liye apekshit satark drushti ko viksit karne main bhi anuwaad siddhanth kaa gyaan anuvadak kii sahaayta karata he 
 The same question is also seen from the other end
 kaha jaataa he ki jo log moulik likh sakate hai, ve likhte hai, jo likh nahin pate ve anuwaad karte hai, or jo log anuwaad nahin kar sakate, ve anuwaad ke bare main charchaa kiya karte hai 
 In fact, these three are complementary - all three are different - however it is believed that the translation theory experience helps the student of translation theory to make the translation discussion more authentic and vivid
 yah baat kuch aisa hi he ki sarjanaatmakataa se anubhav ke str par parichit sahitya sameekshak apni samikshatmak pratikriyaaon ko adhik vishvasotpadak reeti se prastut kar saktaa he
 Looking at the current form of translation theory, its development is seen by dividing it into two stages from the vivid view: aadhunik bhashavigyaan, vishesh rup se anuprayukt bhashavigyaan, ke vikaas se purv kaa yug-beesvin sadi purvardh; Later era - late twentieth century
 saamaanya rup se kaha jaataa he ki, siddhanth vikaas ke vibhinn yugon main or usee vibhinn dhaaraon main vivaad kaa vishay yah rahaa ki, anuwaad shabdanugami ho yaa arthanugami, yadhyapi vivaad kii 'bhashaa' badalati rahi 
 BCE begins in the first century from the Roman era, when Horrens and Cicero distinguished the word for vowel and semantic translation and gave priority to the semantic translation for literary works
 siciro ne achche anuvadak ko vyakhyaakaar tathaa alankaar prayog main daksh bataaya 
 After the Roman era, which dominated literary translations, the second powerful section is the Bible translation
 sant jerome ne bhi bible ke anuwaad main arthanugamita ko pradhanta di tathaa anuwaad main dainandin ke vyavhaar kii bhashaa ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 The idea in this was that the message of the Bible should reach the masses and for this reason, the language of comprehension should be used for the masses, in which the economical approach by nature predominated
 jaan vicliff tathaa wiliam tindl ne is pravriti kaa samarthan kiya
 The propensity to translate the Bible was encouraged, in which Martin Luther's contribution was remarkable, in the language of comprehension and beauty, and protecting the harmony between style and meaning
 tritiy dhara shikshakram main anuwaad ke yogadan se sambandhit rahi he
 Quitilian saw the utility of translation and bilingual lexical translation in the context of developing writing practice and speech-skills
 jiskaa madhyakaalin europe main adhik prasar hua 
 This raised the level of local languages and also increased their expressive power
 samrudh or viksit bhashaaon se vikasshil bhashaaon main anuwaad kii pravriti madhyakaalin europe ke saahitiyik jagat kii ek pramukh pravriti he, jise urdhvastari aayam kii pravriti kaha gaya or isi samay prachlit samaan rup se viksit yaa aviksit bhashaaon ke madhya anuwaad kii pravriti ko samastari aayam kii pravriti ke rup main dekha gaya
 Among the early theories of medieval Europe, the French scholar E
 Dolet proposed five prohibitions of translation in the essay published in 1540: anuvadak ko mul lekhak kii bhashaa kii puraa gyaan ho, parantu vah chaahe to mulbhasha kii durbodhata or aspashtataa ko dur kar saktaa he
 The translator has complete knowledge of the native language and the target language; anuvadak shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad se bache; Use the language of translator Dainandin's practice; anuvadak aisa shabdachayan tathaa shabdavinyas kare ki uchit prabhaav kii nishpatti ho
 George Chapman likewise proposed three sources of translation with reference to the 'iliad': shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad se bachaa jaae; Try to reach the spirit of the original; anuwaad, vidvatta ke sparsh ke kaaran ati shithil na ho 
 The stream of translation was a secondary trend in the Renaissance era of Europe
 is yug ke anuvaadakon main arth kii pradhanta ke saath pathak ke hiton kii raksha kii pravriti dikhaai detii he 
 In the translation of the Netherlands, the meaning of the text is reflected in the rite of the translated text by the addition and modification
 satrahavin shatabdi main england main sar jaan denham ne kavita ke anuwaad main shabdanugami hone kii pravriti kaa virodh kiya or mul paath ke kendriya tatva ko grahan kar lakshyabhasha main uske punassarjan kii baat kahi; use 'anusarjan' kaha jane laga
 In this period, John Dryden revealed important ideas
 unhone anuwaad kaary kii teen kotiyaan nirdhaarit kii : Word-per-word translation; arthanugami anuwaad, Simulation
 dryden ke anusaar or ke madhya kaa maarg avlamban yogya he 
 According to him, in translating poetry, the translator should have authority over both languages, have knowledge of the literary qualities of the original author and his 'spirit', and follow the literary ideals of his time
 aleggender pope ne bhi dyden ke samaan hi vichaar prakat kiye 
 The problem of the translator's duty to his contemporary readers was a step further from the controversy over the superstition and hyper-freedom of translation in the eighteenth century
 pathak kii ore atyadhik jhukaav ke kaaran anudit paath kaa swaroop mul paath se kaaphi dur pad jaataa tha
 To this, Dr
 Samuel Johnson said that, in translation, the culmination due to additions rather than the text can be welcomed, but attention should be paid to the loss of the text
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki jis prakaar lekhak apane samakaleen pathak ke liye likhata he, usee prakaar anuvadak bhi apane samakaleen pathak ke liye anuwaad karata he 
 In Dr
 Jansan's opinion, there is a balance between the basicity of the translation and the readership
 unhone anuvadak ko aisa chitrakaar yaa anukarta kaha jo mul ke prati nishthavan hote hue bhi uddisht darshak ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhata he 
 Alexander Fraser Tittler, whose book Principles of Translation is considered the first systematic book on translation theory
 titaler ne teen anuwaad sutara prastaavit kiye : The translation should have full maintenance of the sentiment of the original composition; anuwaad kii style mul ke anuroop ho; Translations should have original comprehension
 titaler ne hi yah kaha ki, anuwaad main mul kii bhaavana is prakaar purnataya sashakrant ho jaae ki use padhkar pathakon ko utani hi teevr anubhuti ho, jitani mul ke pathakon ko hui thi; prabhavasmata kaa siddhanth yahi he 
 The influence of erstwhile poetrymaking on translation thinking in the romantic and post-romantic eras in the nineteenth century is visible
 e0 dablyoo0 shlegal ne sab prakaar ke maukhik evam likhit bhashaa vyavhaar ko anuwaad kii sangya di, tathaa mul ke gathan ko sangrakshit rakhane par bal diya 
 In this age, on the one hand, there is a tendency for the translator to think like a creative writer, on the other hand, it was said that the translation should be emphasized to make it translatable
 kuch vidwaanon ne anuwaad kii bhinn upbhasha hone kaa charchaa kii jo uparyukt manyataon se mail khaati he
 The translators of the Victorian Section have been striving to preserve the distance between country and time in translation - foreign language and antiquity are not lost in the translation of ancient works of foreign languages - which in turn encouraged the trend of vernacular translation
 laungphelo iske samarthak the 
 But Fitzgerald, the translator of Omar Khayyam's rubies, had the opposite view
 ve is manyata ke samarthak the ki, anuwaad ke pathak ko mul bhashaa paath ke nikat laane ke sthaan par mulbhasha paath kii saanskrithik visheshtaon ko lakshyabhasha main is prakaar prastut kiya jaae ki, vah lakshyabhasha kaa apni sajiv sampatti prathit ho, tathaa is prakriya main mulbhasha se anuwaad kii badhi hui duuri kii upeksha kar di jaae 
 Two-three translation thinkers are notable in the first half of the twentieth century
 kroche tathaa velri ne anuwaad kii safalataa, vishesh rup se kavita ke anuwaad kii safalataa, main sandeh vyakt kiye hai
 Matthew Arnold emphasized the adoption of a simple, direct and lofty style in the translation of Homer's works
 is prakaar aadhunik bhashavigyaan ke udai se purv kii avadhi main anuwaad chintan praayah do virodhatmak manyataon ke chaaron ore ghumta rahaa
 Those two beliefs are as follows - anuwaad shabdanugami ho yaa swatantra ho, Translation is impossible from the point of view of its inner nature, but very important from the social point of view
 is avadhi ke anuwaad chintan main kul milakar sanghatnatmak tathaa vibhedatmak drushtiyon kaa santulan dekha jaataa rahaa - sanghatnatmak drushti se anuwaad siddhanth kaa aisa swaroop abhipret he jo saamaanya koti kaa ho, tathaa vibhedatmak drushti main paathon kii prakrutigat vibhinnata ke aadhaar par anuwaad kii pranali main aavashyak parivartan kii charchaa kaa antarbhaav he 
 The scholars pondered abstraction during this period, but they could not think of a translation system
 mulpath ke antargyanamoolak bodhan se ve vishleshnatmak bodhan ke lakshya kii ore to bade parantu uske peeche sunishchit siddhanth kii bhoomika nahin rahi
 Apart from translators, among these thinkers, there were more litterateurs and literature reviewers, not linguists
 iske atirikt ve ek-duusare ke chintan se parichit hon, aisa bhi prathit nahin hota tha
 Although modern linguistics emerged in the first half of the twentieth century, the latter period is important in terms of the relevance of translation theory
 is avadhi main bhashavigyaan se parichit anuvaadakon tathaa bhashavigyaniyon kaa dhyaan anuwaad siddhanth kii ore aakrisht hua 
 The development of structural linguistics, the advancement of semantics, the coordination of communication theory and linguistics, and the development of various branches of applied linguistics - sociolinguistics, stylology, psychodynamics, propensity analysis - and the rise of semiotics, especially text signaling, are considered such phenomena, Which is important in terms of confirming and developing the translation theory It was considered angl-amareeki dhara main ek vidvan uzen naida bhi maane jate hai
 On the basis of Bible-translation experience, he gave his views on translation theory and practice as texts
 inamen anuwaad siddhanth kaa vistrut, vishad tathaa tarksangat rup dekhne ko miltaa he
 Describing the translation process, Nida presented a definite linguistic principle for the analysis of the original language text and laid down various dimensions for restructuring the message in the target language
 unhone anuwaad kii sthiti se sambaddh donon bhashaaon ke bich vividhstareey samyojanon kaa vivaran prastut kiya 
 Other scholars are Catford, whose translation theory exemplifies the application of structural linguistics
 unhone shuddh bhashavaigyanik aadhaar par anuwaad ke praroopo kaa nirdhaaran kiya, anuwaad-parivritti kaa bhashavaigyanik vivaran diya, tathaa anuwaad kii simaaon par vichaar kiya 
 The third influential scholar is Peter Numark, who attempted to present a logical and thorough discussion of translation theory in a structured and intimate style
 ve apane vichaaron ko upyukt udaahranon se spasht karte chalate hai
 In contrast to Naida, he offered recognition of a specific translation system according to the text format
 unka anuwaad siddhanth ko yogadan he ki, anuwaad kii arthkendrit tathaa sampreshan kendrit pranali kii sankalpana 
 He presented several translation formulas related to text analysis, communication and expression situations in the target language; It is also considered to be a notable feature of them
 europea parampara main german bhashaa kaa lipsig skool prabhaavshaalee mana jaataa he 
 It is believed that translation of all kinds of experiences is possible
 yah skool paath ke sangyanatmak tathaa sandarbhparak angon main antar maanata he tathaa roopaantaran vyakaran or pathasanketavigyaan kaa bhi upyog karata he 
 This school focused more on the translation of non-literary texts

 Engineers and computer scientists, through the Internet Society, can publish talks in the form of an RFC, to peer review or simply inform new concepts, information or engineer humor
 IETF, RFC ke rup main prakashit kuch prastaavon ko internet maanakon ke rup main apanaataa he
 The RFC format was established in 1969 as part of the primary ARPANET project
 aaj yah internet ejiniyari task force, internet architekchar board or - kuch had tak - saamaanya taur par computer network shodhakartaaon ke vaishvik samudaay ke liye aadhikarik prakaashan madhyam bhi he
 The authors of the first RFC used typography for their work and distributed legible copies among ARPA researchers
 Many early rfcs, unlike modern rfcs, were requests for comments
 The RFC leaves the question open and written in a less formal style
 yah kam aupchaarik style aajkal internet masauda dastavejon kaa saamaanya swaroop he, jo RFC ke rup main manjuuri dene se pehle kaa agragami charan he
 In December 1969, researchers began distributing new rfcs through the newly operational ARPANET
 "mezbaan software" sheershak vaala RFC 1, california vishvavidhyalay, los angeles ke steve crocker dwaara likhaa or 7 april 1969 ko prakashit kiya gaya
 Although it was written by Steve Crocker, it emerged from an initial working group discussion between the RFC, Steve Crocker, Steve Carr, and Jeff Rulifson
 RFC shrinkhalaa ko pehle paribhaashit karne vaale RFC 3 main, crocker ne "network kaary dal" ko RFC shrinkhalaa kaa shrey diya

 Each RFC is assigned a designation under the Internet standardization process in relation to the status
 yah sthiti nimna main se ek hoti he: suchanaatmak, praayogic, uttam maujuuda vyavhaar, standard-trek, yaa aitihaasik 
 standard-trek dastavejon ko aage prastaavit maanak, masauda maanak or internet maanak dastavezon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The term is applied to historical, deprecated standard-track documents or obsolete rfcs that were published prior to the establishment of standard-track
 keval internet ejineering sanchaalan samooh dwaara nirupit IETF, standard-trek RFC kaa anumodan kar sakate hai
 Each RFC is constant; If the document is changed, it is presented again and assigned a new RFC number
 yadi ek RFC internet maanak ban jaataa he, to use ek STD number abantit kiya jaataa he, lekin uski RFC sankhya barkaraar rahati he; tathaapi, jab internet maanak ko adhyatan kiya jaataa he, to uski sankhya vahi rahati he or vah keval ek alag RFC yaa RFC ke set ko sanderbhit karata he
 Suppose an Internet standard, STD n, is RFC x and y at a given time, but may later update to the same standard instead of their RFC z
 udhaaharan ke liye, 2007 main RFC 3700 internet maanak - STD 1 tha - may 2008 main use RFC 5000 se badla gaya, atah RFC 3700 aitihaasik ban gaya, RFC 5000 internet maanak or may 2008 ke anusaar STD 1 he RFC 5000
 jab STD 1 ko dubaara adhyatan kiya jayega, tab vah keval ek nae RFC kaa sandarbh legaa jisane standard trek puraa kiya ho, lekin vah abhi bhi STD 1 hoga
 Best current practices work this way; BCP n refers to a specific RFC or RFC set, but sets of rfcs or rfcs can change over time
 internet maanakon kii nishchit suchi khud ek internet maanak he, STD 1: internet aadhikarik protocol maanak 
 An informative RFC can be anything from a first April joke to a widely recognized essential RFC such as RFC 1591, to proprietary protocols
 kuch suchanaatmak RFC aapaki jaankaree ke liye jaisi up-shrinkhalaa ke rup main ho sakate hai
 While rarely added today, some older fyis are still interesting, for example, FYI 18, the terminology of Internet users
 FYI 17, The Tao of IETF is now RFC 4677, published in 2006
 ek praayogic RFC, ek IETF dastauez yaa RFC sampadak ke liye koi vyaktigat prastuti ho sakati he
 In theory it is really experimental; In practice some documents are not promoted on the standard track, as there are no volunteers present for procedural details
 uttam maujuuda vyavhaar up-shrinkhalaa prashasnic dastavejon or anya paathon ko sangrahit karte hai, jinhen aadhikarik niyam mana jaataa he or ve na keval suchanaatmak hai, balki jo over da vir data ko prabhavit nahin karte
 standard trek or BCP ke bich kii seemaa aksar spasht nahin hoti he
 If a document only affects the Internet standard process, such as BCP 9, or IETF administration, then it is definitely BCP
 yadi vah keval internet asind numbers athurity registrion ke liye niyam or viniyamon ko paribhaashit karata he to vah adhik spasht nahin; inamen adhikansh dastauez BCP hai, par kuch standard trek par bhi hai
 The BCP series also covers technical recommendations for how to treat Internet standards; For example, the use of source filtering to make DOS attacks more difficult is recommended by BCP 38
 aitihaasik RFC vah he jise nae sanskaran se aprachlit kar diya gaya he, jo aise protocol ko pralekhith karata he jise vartmaan internet main rochak nahin mana jaataa, yaa jise anya kaarnon se standard trek se hataa diya gaya he
 Some obsolete rfcs have not been historically classified, as Internet standard procedures generally do not allow regulatory references in other rfcs below standard track rfcs
 saath hi, bahut kam log RFC ko aitihaasik rup main vargeekrut karaane or us aadhaar par sabhi RFC ko niamak rup se adhyatan karne ke liye apekshit prakriyaagat vivaranon ke zarie guzarane main dilchaspee rakhte hai
 Status unknown is used for some very old rfcs, where it is not clear what the status of the document will be when it is published today
 inamen se kuch RFC aaj prakashit hi nahin honge; praarambhik RFC aksar aise hi the: tippanee ke liye ek saral anurodh, protocol nirdisht karne ke uddeshy se nahin, prashasnic prakriya, yaa kuch or, jinke liye aaj RFC shrinkhalaa kaa prayog kiya jaataa he

 a nuclear weapon or nuclear bomb is an explosive device whose base of destructive power is nuclear reaction
 yah nabhikeey sanlayan yaa nabhikeey vikhandan yaa in dono prakaar kii nabhikeey abhicriyon ke sammilan se banaaye ja sakate hai
 Both types of reaction result in huge amount of energy from very few materials
 aaj kaa ek hajaar kilo se thodaa bada nabhikeey hathiyaar itani urja utpann kar saktaa he jitani kai arab kilo ke paramparaagat visphotakon se hi utpann ho sakati he
 Nuclear weapons are known as destructive weapons
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main sabase adhik shaktishaalee visphotak, jo prayukt hua tha, uskaa naam 'blockbster' tha
 In its construction, 11 tons of the most widely known explosive trinitrotoluene was used till then
 is visphotak se 2000 guna adhik shaktishaalee pratham parmaanu bam tha jiskaa visphot tii
 en
 tii
 ke 22,000 ton ke visphot ke baraabar tha
 Now more powerful atomic bombs have been made than the first atomic bomb
 parmaanu bam main visphutit hone vaala padaarth uranium yaa plutonium hota he
 Power is achieved only by nuclear fission of uranium or plutonium
 iske liye parmaanu ke cendrak main neutron se prahaar kiya jaataa he
 a very large amount of energy is obtained from this stroke
 is prakram ko bhautik vigyaani nabhikeey vikhandan kehete hai
 Neutrons are free from the neutrons in the interior of the atom's nucleus
 ye neutron anya parmaanuon par prahaar karte hai or unase phir vikhandan hota he
 They then fission other atoms
 is prakaar shrunkhlaa kriyaayein aarambh hoti hai
 The uncontrolled series of atomic bombs result in the explosion of the atom with great intensity
 uranium ke kai samasthanik gyaat hai
 Normal uranium contains 99
3 percent U-238 and 0
7 percent U-235
 you-238 kaa vikhandan utani saralata se nahin hota jitani saralata se you-235 kaa vikhandan hota he
 U-235 has three neutrons less than U-238
 neutron kii is kami ke kaaran hi you-235 kaa vikhandan saralata se hota he
 Other fissile materials used in atomic bombs are U-233 and plutonium-239
 parmaanu visphot ke liye vikhandaneey padaarth kii kranthik sanhati aavashyak hoti he
 Critical code is the minimum amount of current for a chain action
 yadi vikhandaneey padaarth kii maatra kranthik sanhati se kam he to neutron keval dhurradhurr karata rahegaa
 Increasing the volume slowly will create a time when at least one free neutron strikes a new atom and breaks it down
 aisi sthiti pahunchne par vikhandan kriya swat: chalane lagati he
 The volume of the Revolutionary Code is confidential
 jo raashtra parmaanu bam banaate he ve hi jaanate hai or dusron ko batalaate nahin
 If the critical code of the U-235 is 20 pounds, then the series action will not start by taking ten to ten pounds two
 20 pound ko ek saath lene se hi shrunkhlaakriya chaalu hogi
 The number of neutrons in the chain increases very quickly
 parmaanu bam main vikhandan se uranium or use nikatavarti anya padaarthon kaa taap badi shighrata se upar uthta he
 Metallic uranium transforms into incandescent gas at high pressure and temperature
 visphotak pind kaa taap 10,00,00,000° se
 tak uth jaataa he
 At such a high temperature, the uranium plate is removed
 tab sara pind badi prachandta se visphutit hota he
 Atomic bombs erupt and produce half-waves that propagate around at speeds greater than the speed of sound
 jab parmaanu bam ko prithvital ke upar visphutit kiya jaataa he to tarangen prithvital se takaraakar upar uthati hai or nayaa aghat utpann karti hai jo upar or neeche tivrata se failata he
 The center of the bomb blast immediately warms and produces vacuum
 nirvaat bharne ke liye aasapaas kii thandi hawaayen daudti he
 In this way they are broken by atomic bombs hitting homes
 visphoti uranium anya tatwon main badal jaataa he, usase radio actevedhi kirane nikalakar jivit koshikaon ko aakraant kar unhen nasht kar detii hai
 The destructive function of the bomb is due to shock waves, piercing rays and excessive heat production
 hydrogen bam parmanubam kaa ek kism he
 a hydrogen bomb or H-bomb is a more powerful atomic bomb
 isamen hydrogen ke samasthanik du tirium or tritirium kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Fusion of atoms causes the bomb to explode
 is sanlayan ke liye bade unche, taap, lagbhag 500,00,000° sein
 kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 This temperature is much higher than the temperature of the sun's hottest part
 parmaanu bam dwaara hi itnaa unchaa taap praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 America, England, Russia, China and India tested hydrogen bombs
 mana ja rahaa ha ki uttar korea ne bhi esa khatarnaak bam banaaya he
 Hydrogen atoms are absorbed only when the atomic bomb produces the required heat
 is sanlayan se ooshmaa or shaktishaalee kirane utpann hoti hai jo hydrogen ko helium main badal detii hai
 In 1922 AD, it was first discovered that the explosion of hydrogen atom can generate a lot of energy
 1932 main duterium naamak baari hydrogen kaa or 1934 i
 main tritirium naamak baari hydrogen kaa avishkaar hua
 In 1950, the President of the United States of America, Tru Man, ordered the preparation of a hydrogen bomb
 iske liye 1951 i

 The MMR vaccine controversy in the United States in 1998 resulted in a "measles party" even after mmr's potential link in combined vaccines and autism, where parents allowed their children to be measles by not intentionally injecting them
 By doing this, their immunity will increase
 This practice led to many fatal diseases in children, which is why the public health authorities prevented them from doing so
 Scientific evidence does not support the hypothesis that MMR has a role in autism

 Operating knowledge of these rules gives us information regarding "cause" and "effect"
 kisi suniyojit prayog main ham praaia: kaarnon kii jatil paddati ke sthaan par saral paddati kii sthapana kar sakate hai, jisamen ek baar main ek hi kaaran se paristhiti kaa vicharan karaayaa jaataa he
 This is probably the ideal situation and this type of experiment is not possible in many areas
 udhaaharan ke liye, prekshak saamaajik tathyon kaa prayog nahin kar saktaa or use un paristhitiyon ko, jo uske vash main nahin hai, jyon kaa tyon lekar chalanaa padataa he
 Statistics is related to statistics affected for many reasons
 kaarnon ke janjaal se ek ke atirikt baaki sabhi kaarnon ko chhantakar suljhaana prayogon kaa uddeshy he
 Due to this not being possible in all situations, the statistical data is accepted by the group due to the analysis, and it is from the statistics itself that it tries to know which factors are of importance and each of these reasons
 What effect has the impact on the operations of the company
 isi main hamaare gyaan kii is shakha kii vilakshan or vishisht shakti he, jisase isaki samruddhi hui he or yah praaia: sarvavyaapak ho gai he
 For example, suppose that we have to find out the effect of different fertilizers on the yield of wheat
 iske liye yah paryaapt nahin he ki khaadon kii sankhya ke baraabar bhukhand chunakar, prayek bhukhand main ek-ek khaad ke upachaar se fasal ugaai jaae or upaj main jo antar ho, use khaad ke prabhaav kaa maapak maan liya jaae; kyonki yah siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki ek hi khaad ke prabhaav se bhinn-bhinn bhukhndon main upaj bhinn hoti he
 There are many reasons for the variation of yield in plots
 vibhinn maatra main khaad ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan kiya jaae, arthath vibhinn talon, vibhinn formon or vibhinn varshon main prayog kiye jaaen, to adhyayan or bhi jatil ho jaataa he
 But by a specific numerical method called "analysis of variance", whose main credit is R
A
 Fischer has, we can arrive at valid conclusions by breaking the overall variance, taking the variance for different reasons
 aajkal krishi ke atirikt kai duusare kshetron main bhi is pravidhi kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 Studying a group or community designated by the name of macro, rather than an individual, is a statistical science and fundamental assumption
 isaki paribhaasha ham vaigyanik paddati kii us shakha ke rup main kar sakate hai jo ginakar yaa maapkar praapt samshtigat gunon kaa, jaise kisi manushya varg kii oonchaai yaa bhaar se, kisi khaas ghaan main nirmit dhaatu dandon kii tanaav samarthy jaisi prakritik ghatnaon ke aankadon se, yaa sankshep main aavriti kriya se praapt kisi bhi prayogtmak aankade kaa adhyayan karti he
 Hence, the first duty of a statistician is to collect data
 yah vah swayan kar saktaa he, yaa anya uddeshy se ekatrit duusare aankadon kaa prayog kar saktaa he
 Principal on the first type of data and second type of data is called secondary
 aankadon ke prayog kar kisi parinaam par pahunchne ke purv, unki vishwasaneeyata kii jaanch kar leni chahie
 The second step of statistical study is the classification and tabulation of collected data
 yadi prekshanon kii sankhya adhik he, to aankadon kaa vargeekaran abhisht hi nahin, aavashyak bhi he
 Some amount of information has to be discarded while condensing
 kintu mastishk vrihad ank raashi kaa arth samajhane main asamarth hota he
 Therefore condensation is necessary to overvalue the fact represented by the data
 sanghanan ke baad aankadon ko barambharataa-bantan-sarini ke rup main nirupit karte hai
 From this table, the denominator numbers, which are single numbers, are easy to identify and represent the properties of the data divergence and variance by the central tendency and standard deviation of the data from the mean, secondary, polymer etc
 aankadon ko vakr rekhachitron, chitralekhon aadi dwaara bhi prastut kiya ja saktaa he or is prakaar ke prastutikaran se praaia: mastishk ko aankadon kii vyakhya, bhavishyavaanee, anumaan or ant main purvanumaan 
 Some statisticians do not consider forecasting as a statistician's duty, but most believe it
 kisi jansankhya kii samshti ke adhyayan main, prayek sadsy kaa alag-alag adhyayan, sankhya kii vipulata or shram tathaa laagat ke apvyay ke kaaran, vyaavhaarik nahin thahartaa
 Therefore, in order to gain knowledge in relation to the mass community, we study the selection of the members, which are called samples
 pratidarsh mul samshti kii jaankaree pradaan karata he
 Information cannot be expected as absolute certainty
 ise praaia: sambhavita ke rup main hi prakat karte hai
 This part of statistics is called estimation
 sankhyikeevid ko kuch praathmik kaaryon ke liye, jaise sanchayan, vargeekaran, saraneekaran, lekhachitreey upasthaapan aadi ke liye vishisht prashikshan ke saath hi praarambhik ganit kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he or baad main aganan, anumaan or purvanumaan ke liye ucch ganit or sambhavita ke siddhant kii sahaayta leni padati he
 In the fields of economics, sociology and commerce, unemployment is increasing or decreasing, there is a shortage of buildings and if so, to what extent, whether malnutrition is happening or not, whether alcoholism has reduced crime, etc
 Questions are solved by statistics
 janan vigyaan, jeev vigyaan or krishi main sankhyikeey vidhiyon kaa prayog ab anivaary ho chalaa he
 a new branch of biology has come out, Biological Statistics, under which statistical study of zoological variations is done
