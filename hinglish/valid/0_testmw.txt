 It resembles many indo-aryan languages such as Marathi, Bengali, Oriya, Assamese and Vedic Sanskrit etc

 Dr
 Grison refers to the language as "bishnupuriya Manipuri", while some other writers call it "bishnupriya" yah "bishnupuriya"
 bishnupriya manipuri ke adhiktar log manipur se palaayan kiye atharahavin or unnisvin shatabdi ke dauraan assam, manipur ke rajkumaron ke bich aantarik sangharsh or burma ke hamale ke kaaran assam, tripura, silhet or kachaar main sharan lee
 As a result, it was difficult for the small number of Bishnupriya who remained in Manipur to maintain their language in the face of the influence of Manipur, although in 1891 Dr

 The language is slowly starting to lose its ground in Manipur against the vast majority of the Maitai sect and against the vast majority of Bengali speakers in Cachar and Bangladesh is slowly experiencing its decay
 yah bhashaa abhi bhi jiribam, kachar or tripura or bangladesh ke kuch ilaakon main boli jaati he
 This language is known to its speakers as Eamar Thar, which means "my mother's language
 " ve khud ko or unki bhashaa manipuri kehete hai, or bishnupriya shabd ko manipur ke anya jaateey samoohon se alag karne ke liye upyog karte hai
 The word Bishnupriya is probably derived from Bishnupur, with the suffix -ya, which means "the people of Bishnupur"
 Bishnupriya Manipuri holds that the language was passed to Manipur by some immigrants from Dwarka and Hastinapura soon after the Mahabharata war
 
 aage yah kaha gaya he ki in apravasiyon kaa netritv chitrarangada or arjuna ke putr babruvahan or tritiy pandav ne kiya tha
 Some scholars and history writers have supported the ancient Manipur origin of the Mahabharata period of Bishnupriya Manipuri by observing the morphology, vibronic, and phonology of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language
 Bishnupriya Manipuri believes that his language is strongly influenced by Sanskrit and Maharashtra as well as Sauraseni nature

 It has been found from his observations that the language has retained the salient features of magadha
according to Dr
 Sinha, Maithili, Oriya, Bengali and Assamese have pronouns and are related to or closely related to the lexical and conjunctive endings

 Kabir or Bhagat Kabir was a 15th century Indian mystic poet and saint
 ve hindi sahitya ke bhaktikalin yug main gyanashrayi-nirgun shakha kii kavyadhara ke pravartak the
 His compositions influenced the Bhakti movement of the Hindi state to a deeper level
 unke lekhan sikhon ke aadi granth main bhi mila ja saktaa he
 He was a critic of Hinduism and Islam
 unhone saamaajik andhvishwaas kii ninda kii or saamaajik buraaiyon kii sakht aalochana kii thi
 During his lifetime both Hindus and Muslims threatened him for his views
 kabir panth naamak dharmik sampradaay inaki shikshaaon ke anuyaayi hai
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars about the place of birth, but most scholars consider their birth in Kashi only, which also confirms this statement of Kabir himself
 kabir ke guru ke sambandh main prachlit kathan he ki kabir ko upyukt guru kii talash thi
 He wanted to make Vaishnava saint Acharya Ramanand his master but he refused to make Kabir a disciple but Kabir decided in his mind to make Swami Ramananda his master at all costs, for this, a thought in Kabir's mind He came that Swami Ramanand ji goes to bathe in the Ganges at four o'clock in the morning before he will lie down the stairs on his way and he did so
 ek din, ek pahar raat rahete hi kabir panchganga ghat kii sidhiyon par gir pade
 Ramanand ji was descending the stairs to perform Gangesan, when his foot fell on Kabir's body
 unke mukh se tatkaal 'ram-ram' shabd nikal padaa
 Kabir accepted the same Rama as the deeksha-mantra and accepted Ramanand ji as his guru
 kabir ke hi shabdon main- Kabir used to work as a weaver to earn a living
 kabir kii drudh manyata thi ki karmon ke anusaar hi gati milti he sthaan vishesh ke kaaran nahin
 He went to Maghar at the end of time to prove his belief; because people believed that one dies in Kashi and one gets heaven when Maghar dies
 magahar main unhone antim saans lee
 Even today the tomb and mausoleum are located there
 kabir kii bhashaa sadhukkadi he
 Their language includes the language of all the dialects of Hindi language
 rajasthani, haryaanavi, punjabi, khadi boli, avadhi, brajabhasha ke shabdon kii bahulata he
 The disciples collected their works in a book titled "bijak" which has three main parts: Sakhi, Sabad, Ramani sadhu santon kaa to ghar main jamaavada rahata hi tha
 Kabir was not educated - 'don't touch my paper, i don't touch a pen
 'unhone swayan granth nahin likhe, munh se bhakhe or unke shishyon ne use likh liya
 The glory of Ramnama is echoed in all your thoughts
 ve ek hi ishwar ko maanate the or karmkand ke ghor virdohi the
 They did not consider avatar, idol, Roza, Eid, Masjid, temple etc
 ve kabhi kehete hai- 'harimor Piu, i am Ram's daughter-in-law', sometimes say, 'hari janani main balak tora'
 or kabhi "bada hua to kya hua jaisai" At that time, the Hindu public was affected by the terror of Muslim terror
 kabir ne apane panth ko is dhang se suniyojit kiya jisase muslim mat kii ore jhuki hui janata sahaj hi inaki anuyaayi ho gayi
 He kept his language simple and comprehensible so that it could reach the common man
 isse donon sampradaayon ke paraspar milan main suvidha hui
 Their creeds were against Muslim culture and cow-feeding
 kabir ko shantimay jivan priy tha or ve ahimsa, satya, sadachaar aadi gunon ke prashansak the
 Today, due to his simplicity, saintly nature and saintly tendency, he is also being respected abroad

 There was a small temple of Ramakrishna
 vahaan ke sant bhagwaan goswami ke jigyaasu sadhak the kintu unke tarkon kaa abhi tak puri tarah samaadhaan nahin hua tha
 He exchanged views with Sant Kabir
 kabir kii ek saakhi ne un ke man par gaharaa asar kiya- 'ban te bhaga bhirahe bhi bhi bhi, moan apni baan karaha bedan kaason kahe, ko karaha ko jaan
 
 ' Who should tell the elephant who has fallen in the pit lost by the fowler while running from the forest? saransh yah ki dharm kii jigyaasa sein prerit ho kar bhagwaan gosai apana ghar chhod kar baahar to nikal aaye or harivyasi sampradaay ke gadde main gir kar akele nirvasit ho kar asanvaadya sthiti main pad chuke hai
 Targeting the idol worship, he made a appearance - paahan puuje hari milain, to main poojon pahaar
 Well, it is good, PC Khay Sansar
 
 Kabir's Rama is unknowable and resides in every particle of the world
 kabir ke ram islam ke akeshwarwadi, eksattavadi khuda bhi nahin hai
 In Islam, Khuda or Allah is believed to be different from entire world and creatures and supremely capable
 par kabir ke ram param samarth bhale hon, lekin samast jeevon or jagat se bhinn to kadaapi nahin hai
 Rather, on the contrary, they are the prevalent Ramta Ram
 vah kehete hainvyapak brahm sabanimain ekai, ko pandit ko jogi
 ravana-rao Kavansun Kavan Veda
 kabir ram kii kisi khaas roopakriti kii kalpana nahin karte, kyonki roopakriti kii kalpana karte hi ram kisi khaas dhaanche main bandh jate, jo kabir ko kisi bhi haalat main manjuur nahin
 Kabir wanted to give a different and broader form to the concept of Ram
 iske kuch vishesh kaaran the, jinaki charchaa ham is lekh main aage karenge
 But despite this, Kabir definitely establishes a personal family type relationship with Ram
 ram ke saath unka prem unki alokik or mahimashali satta ko ek kshan bhi bhulaae bagaiyr sahaj premparak maanviya sambandhon ke dharaatal par pratishthit he
 Kabir believes in the name, not the form
 haalaanki bhakthi-samvednaa ke siddhanton main yah baat saamaanya rup se pratishthit he ki ‘naam rup se badhkar he’, lekin kabir ne is saamaanya siddhant kaa kranthidharmee upyog kiya
 Kabir, with the name Ram, gave a sublime and comprehensive look to the centuries-old synthetic sentiments created in Lokmanya and tried to prevent him from being tied to the mythology-propounded Brahminical ideology
 kabir ke ram nirgun-sagun ke bhed se pare hai
 In fact, he used the word 'nirgun Rama' - 'nirgun Rama Japahu Re Bhai' to separate his Rama from Rastra, the patron of the scripturally-rendered Avatari, Saguna, dominant Varnashrama system
 ’ is ‘nirgun’ shabd ko lekar bhram main padane kii jarurat nahin
 Kabir means just this word that God cannot be bound within the boundaries of any name, form, quality, time etc
 jo sari simaaon se pare hai or phir bhi sarvatra hai, vahi kabir ke nirgun ram hai
 He named it 'ramta Ram'
 apane ram ko nirgun visheshan dene ke baavjood kabir unke saath maanviya prem sambandhon kii tarah ke rishte kii baat karte hai
 Sometimes he considers Rama as his lover or husband, and sometimes he is a lord in the sense of bondage
 kabhi-kabhi vah ram ko vatsalya murti ke rup main maan maan lete hai or khud ko unka putr
 This kind of succulent, spontaneous, human love is unique to Kabir's devotion even with the nirgun-formless Brahm
 yah duvidha or samasya dusron ko bhale ho sakati he ki jis ram ke saath kabir itane anany, maanviya sambandhparak prem karte hon, vah bhala nirgun kaise ho sakate hai, par khud kabir ke liye yah samasya nahin he
 He also says, "santou, tell me cheating
 gunamem nirgun, nirgunamem gun, baat chhandi kyun bahise!”nahin he
 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain, while expressing his views regarding Kabir's spiritual practice of Ram and Kabir, said: "kabir's entire life was spent in the search for truth and refutation of the truth
 kabir kii sadhana ‘‘maanane se nahin, ‘‘jaanane se armbh hoti he
 He is not a disciple of anyone, but a disciple warned by Ramanand
 unke liye ram rup nahin he, dasharathi ram nahin he, unke ram to naam sadhana ke pratik hai
 His Rama is not imprisoned within the boundaries of any sect, caste or country
 prakruti ke kan-kan main, ang-ang main raman karne par bhi jise anang sparsh nahin kar saktaa, ve alakh, avinashi, param tatv hi ram hai
 His Rama is not a discriminator between man and man
 ve to prem tatv ke pratik hai
 Rising above the sense of love or worship are: ‘prem jagaavai virah ko, virah jagaavai piu, piu jagaavai jeev ko, joi piu soi jiu' - jo piu he, vahi jeev he
 That is why his whole practice is the practice of "hans Ubaran Aaya"
 is hans kaa ubaarana pothiyon ke padhane se nahin ho saktaa, dhai aakhar prem ke aacharan se hi ho saktaa he
 Religion is not a matter of wear and tear, it is a continuous practice of conduct in life
 unki sadhana prem se armbh hoti he
 Love it so deeply that God becomes divine for you
 usko paane kii itani utkantha ho jaae ki sabase vairaygy ho jaae, virah bhav ho jaae tabhi us dhyaan samadhi main piu jaagrath ho saktaa he
 That same Pew can awaken a creature sitting in your heart
 joi piu he soi jiu he
 Then you will love the world, the world will become an object of your love for each organism
 sara ahankaar, sara dwesh dur ho jayega
 Then great spirit will arise
 isi mahabhaav se puraa sansar piu kaa ghar ho jaataa he

 Since no first-payment fraction exists for the first work-related payment exchange, human society would have needed to develop so much in the first salaried task that it would be possible to exchange goods in exchange for goods or other work
 There exists a barter system

 Main article: Modern synthesis In the 1920s and 1930s, so-called modern synthesis has been linked to natural selection and population genetics, which is based on Mandalian inheritance, in a unified theory that is generally associated with any of biology Applies to branch
 aadhunik sanshleshan ne prajatiyon main jansankhya main dikhaae gaye pattern, playatology main jeevashm sankraman ke madhyam se or vikasshil jeev vigyaan main jatil cellular tantron ko samajhaayaa
 The publication of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance
 anuvaanshik jeev vigyaan ne ginotip or phenotip ke bich sambandhon kii hamaari samaj main sudhaar kiya
 Progress was made in phylogenetic systematics through the publication and use of progressive pastes on mapping the transition of properties to a comparative and testable framework
 1 9 73 main, vikasvaadi jeevigyaani theodosius dobbhhanski ne likhaa he ki "jeev vigyaan main kuch bhi vikaas ke prakaash main nahin chodta he", kyonki yah un prakritik sambandhon ke virodhabhasi tathyon ko pehle ke sambandhon ko prakaash main laayaa he, jo gyaan ke ek spasht vyaakhyaatmak sharir main varnan karata he or is grah par jivan ke bare main kai avlokan tathyon kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 Since then, modern synthesis has been put forward to explain biological phenomena at the full and integrated scale of the biological hierarchy, from genes to species
 yah vistaar, vikasvaadi vikaas jeev vigyaan ke rup main janaa jaataa he or anaupchaarik rup se "evo-dev" kaha jaataa he, yah darshata he ki pidiyon ke bich parivartan vyaktigat jeevon ke bheetar parivartan ke pattern par kaise kaary karata he
 In the light of discoveries made since the beginning of the 21st century and in recent decades, some biologists have argued for an extended evolutionary synthesis, that is, non-genetic inheritance modes, such as epigenetics, ancestral influences, ecological and cultural heritage, And transcendence adhik jaankaree: anuvanshiki, anuvanshiki, anuvanshikta, or pratikriya ke aadarshon kaa parichay The DNA structure bases are in the center, surrounded by phosphate-sugar chains in a double helix
 jeevon main vikaas, anuvaanshik gunon main parivartan-ek jeev kii viraasat visheshtaon ke madhyam se hota he
 In humans, for example, eye color is an inherited trait and a person may inherit the "brown-eye symptom" from their parents
 vanshanukramit gun jin dwaara niyantrit hote hai or jeevon ke jinom ke bheetar jin kaa puraa set isaki ginotip kehalaata he
 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment
 natijatan, ek jeev ke phenotype ke kai pahaluon ko viraasat main nahin miltaa he
 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn
 anuvanshik jaankaree diene ke madhyam se ek peedi se duusare ke paas ja sakate hai, ek anu jo anuvanshik jaankaree ko encode karte hai
 DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases
 ek vishesh diene anu ke saath kursiyaan kaa anukram anuvaanshik jaankaree ko nirdisht karata he, ek vaakya ko varnit patron ke anukram ke samaan
 Before the cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the two cells will inherit the DNA sequence as a result
 ek diene anu kaa ansh jo ek ekal kaary ikai ko nirdisht karata he jise jin kaha jaataa he; vibhinn jeenon ke aadhaar ke vibhinn drishy hai koshikaon ke bheetar, diene kii lambii kismein chromosome naamak ghaneebhoot sanrachanaon kaa nirmaan karti he
 The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a location
 agar kisi vyakti ke bich ek sthaan par diene anukram bhinn hota he, to is anukram ke vibhinn roopon ko elils kaha jaataa he
 DNA sequences can be altered through mutations, creating new alleles
 yadi ek jin ke bheetar ek utparivartan hota he, to nae elil ko prabhavit kar sakate hai ki jin ke niyantran, jeev ke phenotip ko badalte hai
 However, while in some cases this simple correspondence between alleles and a trait, most traits are more complex and quantitative properties are controlled by loci
 haal ke nishkarshon ne heritable parivartanon ke mahatvapurn udaahranon kii pushti kii he jinhen diene main newcliotide ke anukram main parivartanon se samajhaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 These events are classified as epigenetic inheritance systems
 diene methilation marking chromatin, aatm-nirantar chayapachayee chhoron, arene hastkshep se jin munh band karne or protein kii tri-aiami sanrachana hai, jahaan aise kshetron main ipigenetic viraasat pranali kii khoj kii gai he
 Developmental biologists state that complex interactions in communication between genetic networks and complex cells may lead to variations that may underlie some mechanics in developing plasticity and cannulation
 heriability bhi bade paimaane par bhi ho sakati he udhaaharan ke liye, aalaa nirmaan kii prakriya ke madhyam se paristhitik viraasat ko unke paryaavaran main niyamit rup se or dohraye jane vaale jeevon dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 This generates a legacy of influences that modify and feed into the selection regime of later generations
 purvajon ke paristhitik kaaryon se paidaa hone vaale vanshaj, jeens or paryaavarniya visheshtaon kaa uttaradhikari hote hai
 Genes are not directly under control, other examples of heritability in the field of development include inheritance of cultural traits and symbiosis
 mukhya lekh: genetic vividhtaddhik jaankaree: genetic vividhta or jansankhya anuvanshikiek jeev ke ginotip or paryaavaran ke prabhaav donon se jivit rahane vaale jeevon kaa phenotip parinaam he
 a significant portion of phenotypic variation in the population is due to genotypic variation
 aadhunik vikasvaadi sanshleshan is anuvaanshik vividhta main samay ke saath parivartan ke rup main vikaas ko paribhaashit karata he
 The frequency of a particular allele will become more or less prevalent to other variants of that gene
 jab ek nayaa elil nirdhaaran ke bindu tak pahunch jaataa he to bhinnata gaayab ho jaati he-jab yah yaa to aabaadi se gaayab ho jaati he yaa puraani elil ko puri tarah badal detii he
 Natural selection will only cause growth if there are substantial genetic changes in the population
 mendelion anuvanshiki kii khoj se pehle, ek saamaanya avadharana viraasat ko sammishrit kar rahaa tha
 But with blending inheritance, genetic variation will be rapidly lost, making evolution impossible by natural selection
 hardi-venberg siddhant main yah pataa chalata he ki jansankhya main mendelion viraasat ke saath kis prakaar bhinnata banaae rakhi jaati he
 The frequencies of alleles will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift
 vividhta jinom main utparivartan se aati he, jansankhya ke bich yon prajnan or pravaas ke madhyam se jin ke pherbadal
 Despite the continuous introduction of new variations through mutation and gene flow, most genomes of a species are the same in all individuals of that species
 haalanki, ginotip main apekshaakrit chote antar bhi phenotip main naatakeey antar paidaa kar sakate hai: udhaaharan ke liye, chimpanji or insaan apane jeenomon main se lagbhag 5% main antar karte hai
 Main article: Mutation ek gunasutra ke hisse kaa doharaavamuteshan koshika ke jinom ke diene anukram main parivartan hai
 When mutations occur, they can alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect
 udo drosophila melenogaster main padhai ke aadhaar par, yah suzav diya gaya he ki yadi koi jin jin dwaara nirmit protein main parivartan karata he, to yah sambhawatah hanikaarak hoga, inamen se lagbhag 70% muteshan hanikaarak prabhaav padataa he, or shesh tatasth yaa kamjor rup se laabhakaari
 Mutations can involve repeating large sections of a chromosome, which may introduce additional copies of a gene into the genome
 jin kii atirikt pratiyaan viksit karne ke liye nae jeenon ke liye aavashyak kachche maal kaa ek pramukh strot hai
 This is important because most genes evolve from pre-existing genes into gene families, which share common ancestors
 udhaaharan ke liye, maanviya aankh un sanrachanaon ko banane ke liye chaar jin kaa upyog karata he jo prakaash ko samajhate hai: rang drushti ke liye teen or raat drushti ke liye ek; sabhi chaar ek ekal paitruk jin se utarate hai
 When a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function, a new gene can be generated from the tribal gene
 ek baar jin ko doharaaya gaya he, kyonki yah pranali kii atirek bad jaati he, yah prakriya aasaan ho jaati he; jodi main ek jin ek nayaa samaaroh praapt kar sakati he jabaki duusari prati iske mul kaary ko jari rakhti he
 Other types of mutations may generate entirely new genes from previously non-coding DNA
 nae jeenon kii peedi bhi kai jeenon ke chote hisse ko doharaaya ja saktaa he, in tukdon ke saath nae kaaryon ke saath nae sangyojan banane ke liye pun: sangyojan kiya ja saktaa he
 When new genes are assembled by manipulating pre-existing parts, the domain acts as a module with simple independent functions, which can be combined with new and complex functions to produce new combinations
 
 udhaaharan ke liye, policted sinthasis bade anzime hote hai jo antibiotics banaate hai; ve ek sau swatantra domen tak hote hai jo prayek ek samgr prakriya main ek kadam uthte hai, jaise ek vidhansabha line main ek kadam More information: Sexual reproduction, genetic recombination, and development of sexual reproduction In homosexual organisms, genes are inherited together, or linked, because they cannot be mixed with genes of other organisms during reproduction
 iske vipareet, yon jeevon ke santanon main unke mata-pita ke gunasutron ke swatantra mishran ke madhyam se utpann hote hai
 According to a related process called recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matched chromosomes
 punarsangyojan or punarsanrachana elle aavritiyon ko badalati nahin he, balki alils ke nae sanyojanon ke saath santanon ko janm dene vaale elils ek duusare ke saath jude hue hai
 Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of development
 yah aarekh sex kii dohari laagat ko darshata he
 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation
 phir bhi eukeriots or bahukoshikeey jeevon ke bich yon prajnan prajnan ke adhik saamaanya saadhan hai
 The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to understand the importance of sexual reproduction as a means of enabling continuous development and adaptation in response to co-evolution with other species in an ever-changing environment
 is
 adhik jaankaree: jin pravahjan pravaah jansankhya or prajatiyon ke bich jin kaa aadan-pradaan hota he
 It may therefore be a source of diversity that is new to the population or a species
 Gene flow may be due to the movement of individuals between different populations of organisms, as the movement of mice or grasses between inland and coastal populations
 k may be due to the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations
 prajatiyon ke bich jin hastantaran main hybrid jeevon or kshaitij jin sthanantaran kaa gathan shaamil he
 Horizontal gene transfer refers to the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another that is not in its lineage; It is most common in bacteria
 dawa main, yah antibiotic pratirodh ke prasar main yogadan detaa he, jaise jab ek bacteria pratirodh jin kaa adhigrahan karata he, to yah unhen anya prajatiyon main teji se sthanantarit kar saktaa he
 Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria such as yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred
 bade paimaane par sthaanantaran kaa ek udhaaharan eukeriotic badeloid roticers he, jise jeevanu, kavak or paudhon se kai jin praapt hue hai
 Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing the transfer of genes into biological domains as well
 chloroplasts or mitochondriya ke adhigrahan ke dauraan, eukeriotic koshikaon or bacteria ke purvajon ke bich bade paimaane par jin transfar bhi hua he
 It is possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal gene translocation between bacteria and Archaea
 gaharaa rang ke saath aabaadi main prakritik chayan parinaamon ke baad utparivartan
 From a neo-darwinian perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interracial organisms
 udhaaharan ke liye, patangon kii aabaadi main kaale rang ke liye aleble adhik saamaanya ho jate hai tantron jo elil aavritiyon main badlaav laa saktaa he, main prakritik chayan, anuvanshik bahaav, anuvanshik hichhiking, utparivartan or jin pravaah shaamil hai
 Main article: Natural selection natural sellection ke madhyam se vikaas prakriya he jiske dwaara jansankhya kii lagaataar pidiyon main astitv main vruddhi or prajnan adhik saamaanya ho jate hai
 It is often called the "self-sustaining" mechanism because it is necessary that according to three simple facts: akruti vigyaan, sharir vigyaan or vyavhaar ke sambandh main jeevon kii aabaadi ke bheetar bhinnata maujuud he
 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai
 The main concept of natural selection is the ability to develop an organism
 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "
 " mahatvapurn baat, elil kii fitness ek nishchit visheshta nahin he; agar paryaavaran main parivartan, pehle tatasth yaa hanikaarak lakshan phydemand ho sakate hai or pehle laabhakaari gun hanikaarak ho jate hai
 However, even if the direction of selection is reversed in this way, symptoms lost in the past may not re-develop into a uniform form
 ek visheshta ke liye aabaadi ke bheetar prakritik chayan, jo vibhinn prakaar ke mulyon jaise oonchai par bhinn ho sakate hai, ko teen alag-alag prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he pehla dishaatmak chayan hota he, jo ki samay ke saath ek vishesh gun ke ausat mulya main badlaav hota he- udhaaharan ke liye, jeev dhire-dhire oonche ho jate hai
 Second, disruptive selection is selection for highly trait values and often becomes the most common of the two different values, with selection against the mean value
 yah tab hoga jab yaa to laghu yaa ucch jeevon kaa ek phayda hota he, lekin madhyam oonchai ke nahin hote ant main, chayan ko sthir karne main donon ore donon ore ke charam vishesh gunon ke bich chayan hota he, jo ausat mulya or kam vividhta ke aas-paas bhinnata ko kam karata he
 This, for example, causes organisms to gradually become all the same height
 natural sellection kaa ek vishesh maamla yon chayan hota he, jo kisi bhi gun ke liye chayan hota he jo sambhog kii safalataa ko badhaata he or sambhavit mitron ke jeevon ke aakarshan ko badhaata he
 Characteristics developed through sexual selection are especially prominent among males of many animal species
 yadhyapi kaamuk rup se isht, haalanki bojhil sing, sangat kol, bade sharir ke aakaar or ujjwal rang jaise lakshan aksar prerana ko aakarshith karte hai, jo ki vyaktigat purushon ke astitv se samjhauta karte hai
 This survival loss is balanced by high reproductive success in men who show these difficult-to-fake, sexually selected traits
 natural sellection sabase aam taur par swabhaav ko maapta he jiske khilaaf vyaktiyon or vyaktigat gunon ko jivit rahane kii adhik sambhaavna he
 In this sense "nature" refers to an ecosystem, namely a system in which organisms interact with all other elements in their local environment, both physically and biologically
 paristhitiki tantra ke sansthaapak ujin odum ne ek paristhitiki tantra ko paribhaashit kiya he: "kisi bhi ikai main sabhi jeevon ko shaamil kiya jaataa he

 "within an ecosystem each population lives in a specific place or position with different relationships in other parts of the system
 in rishton main jeev kaa jivan itihaas, khaadya shrinkhalaa main isaki sthiti or isaki bhugolic seemaa shaamil he
 This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to characterize specific forces that, together, include natural selection
 prakritik chayan sanghathan ke vibhinn staron par kaary kar saktaa he, jaise ki jin, koshika, vyaktigat jeev, jeevon or prajatiyon ke samooh
 Selection can work at multiple levels simultaneously
 vyaktigat jeev ke str ke neeche hone vaale chayan kaa ek udhaaharan transporens naamak jin he, jo ek jinom main dohraane or fail saktaa he
 Selection at a level above the individual, such as group selection, may allow for the development of cooperation, as described below yah bhi dekhen: maanav kaa vikaas See also: History of Earth adhik jaankaree: abiogenesis, pencparmia, or arene vishwa kii avadharanaprithvi 4

 vartmaan prajatiyaan vikaas kii prakriya main ek charan hai, unki vividhta ke saath prajati or vilupt hone kii ghatnaon kii lambii shrinkhalaa kaa utpaada he
 The common ancestry of organisms is first inferred from four simple facts about organisms: First, they have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptation
