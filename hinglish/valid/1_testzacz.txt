 While Chinese medicine aims to balance yin and yang in the body, feng shui aims to heal a city, site, building, or object through yin yang power fields

 Robert T
 Carroll explains what Feng Shui has become in some cases: "

which are sold with the guarantee of improving your health, enhancing your ability and fulfilling the philosophy of destiny
 " Others have noted that, when feng shui is not used properly, or is used without prudence, it can also harm the environment, which is why people started planting "lucky bamboo" in an ecosystem in which They could not improve
 or bhi kai anya spasht rup se sanshay se bhare hai
 Nevertheless, modern feng shui is not always seen as a superstitious scam
 Many people believe that it is very effective in living a prosperous and healthy life by avoiding or stopping the negative forces, which might have had a bad effect
 pheng shui ke kai ucch-stareey roopon kaa istemaal itani aasaani se bina kisi sambandh ke yaa ek nishchit dhan raashi ke nahin kiya jaataa he kyonki ek visheshgy kii sevaayen leni padati hai, vaastukala yaa dizin main bada badlaav yaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jane ke liye aam taur par atyadhik dhan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Because of this, some lower class people lose faith in Feng Shui, saying that it is a game only for the rich

 For example, James Randy calls feng shui "an ancient form of appearances", while according to skepticussa it is "utterly nonsense, nothing more than ancient Chinese superstition"
 Evidence of its effectiveness is based on anecdote and lacks a pleasant method of action, due to which various practitioners of Feng Shui offer conflicting advice
 pheng shui ke vyavsaayee iskaa kaaran vibhinn vidyalayon main vibhinnata ke saboot bataate hai, isliye gambhir vishleshkon ke anusaar "pheng shui aksar hi adhiktar keval anumaan lagane par aadhaarit he

 It featured many Feng Shui practitioners in the US and sharply criticized conflicting advice

 a travelogue article by the Skeptical Investigative Committee described Feng Shui as "a common understanding of the structure according to the size of the land according to common sense, a suggestion that would have been made by any savvy architect to include any one with thunderstorms and torrential rain
" Land has been given

 Some modern Christians have a similar opinion about feng shui

 In fact, such techniques are related to the world of sorcery

 Harassment was at its peak during the Cultural Revolution, when feng shui was regarded as a custom to exclude the alleged four old men
 pheng shui kaa istemaal karne waalon ko laal rakshakon dwaara peeta or apamaanit kiya gaya tha or unka krityon ko jala diya gaya tha

 Partly because of the Cultural Revolution, less than one-third of the population in main China today believes in feng shui, and the proportion of urban Chinese youth to this belief is extremely low
 pheng shui siikhnaa abhi bhi vartmaan china main varjit mana jaataa he
 Nevertheless, there are reports that Feng Shui is again gaining support among Communist Party officials, according to a 2006 BBC Chinese News comment, and that the number of people doing Feng Shui business has been increasing since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms Huh

 Ancient Nyayasutras first ten sutras in Sanskrit
jpg akshapaad, nyayasutra ke rachayita acharya
 The name of the creator of the famous jurist is named Maharishi Gautam or in the judiciary of Padmapuran, Skandapuran and Vishwanath
 iske vipareet nyaaybhashya, nyaayavarthik, taatparytika tathaa nyaayamanjari aadi vikhyath nyaayashastreey granthon main akshapaad in sutron ke lekhak maane gaye hai
 According to Mahakavi Bhasa, the name of the creator of jurisprudence is Medhatithi
 in vibhinn maton kii ek vaakyata siddh kii ja sakati he
 According to Mahabharata, Gautama Medhatithi is not one of two different people but one person
 gautam spashtatah vanshabodhak akhya he tathaa medhatithi vyaktibodhak sangya he
 Akshapada's semantics is - 'feet in the eye'
 faltah is naam ko sarthakata siddh karne ke liye anek kahaniyaan garh lee gai hai jo sarvatha kalpit, niraadhaar or pramaan shunya hai
 Many scholars have written about Naiyayik Gautama
 mahamahopadhyaay pan
 harprasad shastri kaa kahana he ki chini bhashaa main nibaddh pracheen bhartiya granthon ke anuwaad ke aadhaar par gautam, buddha ke pehle ho gaye the parantu unke naam par prachlit nyayasutra isa kii duusari shatabdi kii rachana he
 Satishchandra Vidyabhushan is of the opinion that the Gautami Dharmasutra and the Nyasutra Karta must have been the same Gautamnamdhari
 ye buddha ke samakaleen rahe honge tathaa inkaa samay 6thi shatabdi isa purv ho saktaa he
 But Vidyabhushan also believes that this Gautama may have composed only the first chapter of the Nyasutra
 baad ke chaar adhyay kisi or ne bahut baad main likhe honge
 Pro
 According to Yakobi, the Nyasutra must have been written after Nagarjuna was founded by nihilism and before the growth of scienceism because it denies nihilism but does not deny scienceism
 parantu pro
 sherwatski ke anusaar nyayasutra main vigyaanavaad kii ore bhi sanket kiya gaya he
 Hence, it will be composed after 500 AD
 parantu sherwatski kaa yah mat nyayasutra ko na samajhane ke kaaran bhramamoolak he
 According to Athalle and Bodas, the editors of Tarkasangraha, Gautama's Nyasutras precede Kanad
 shabaraswami ne upavarsh se uddhran diya he jisase lagata he ki upavarsh nyaay se parichit the
 If this is the minister of Mahapadma Nanda this year, then Gautam should be 400 BC
 Will have to believe pro
 suali ke anusaar ye sutara 300-350 i
 ke kaal ke hai
 According to Richard Garvey, justice is the oldest in theistic philosophies because there is no mention of it before the beginning of the year AD
 at: ye sutara 100-300 i
 ke bich likhe gaye honge
 It is absolutely impossible to say which of these opinions is correct
 nyaysutron kii rachana tathaa gautam kaa kaal in do prashnon par alag alag vichaar hona chahie
 As far as the Nyasutras are concerned, surely these sutras are written after the development of Buddhism
 itnaa or bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki is nyayasutra main samay-samay par sanshodhan tathaa parivardhan hote rahe hai
 But the name of Gautama is not related to these sutras because all these sutras in their present form are unfamiliar with Gautama
 gautam ko ham sirf nyaayashastra kaa pravartak kah sakate hai, sutron kaa rachayita nahin
 It may be that Gautama has written some sutras, but those sutras have become so mixed in other sutras that it is impossible for us to separate them
 in drushtiyon se hamen vidhyabhushan kaa mat adhik maanya lagata he
 Gautama is also known as Akshpad
 vidhyabhushan gautam ko akshapaad se pruthak maanate hai
 The commentators and other lecturers of the Nyasutra consider Akshpad and Gautama to be one
 'akshapaad' shabd kaa arth hota he 'jiske pair main ankhen hon'
 Grammar is familiar with the principles of Mahabhashya Gautama
 nyaysutron main paanch adhyay hai or ye hi nyaay darshan ke mul aadhaar granth he
 Their review shows that the judiciary was spiritually predominant in the beginning, that is, it was the objective to make a real decision on the nature of the soul
 tark tathaa yukti kaa yah sahaara avashya letaa tha, parantu aatma ke swaroop kaa parichay in sadhano ke dwaara karana hi iskaa mukhya taatpary tha
 The theory of that era was that the process which can gain knowledge of self-realization is right and valid
 usase vitarip maanya nahin hoti: But later, in the philosophy of justice, that logic system was specially introduced by which the soul's separation from the soul can be understood well and in which the means of litigation, jalp, vitanda, deceit, caste etc
 are used
 in tarkpradhan nyaysutron ke rachayita akshapaad prathit hote hai
 There is a clear reference to the achievement of the thoughts of both the eras in the current judgments
 nyaayadarshan ke mul rachayita gautam medhatithi hai or uske prati sanskrit-naveen vishyon kaa samavesh kar mul granth ke sanshodhak-akshapaad hai
 The famous treatise of Ayurveda, Charaka Samhita is also the culmination of this ritual system
 mul granth ke praneta maharishi agnivesh hai, parantu iske pratisanskarta charak maane jate hai
 Nyayasutra is likewise a text recited by Akshpad
 gautam nyaayashastra ke pravartak hai
 Examining the meaning on the basis of the evidence is called 'justice', hence it is mainly the evidence
 prameya kaa bhi is darshan main vichaar kiya gaya he par vah gaun ho gaya he
 What is knowledge, how it is produced, how many sources are there for its origin, who are the faults of those sources, their discussion is a matter of justice
 bhartiya parampara main 'nyaay' shabd angreji logic yaa tarkshastra kaa paryaayavachi he
 Buddhists and Jains have also practiced their rationale and they are also called Buddhnanya and Jaina
 par jahaan keval nyaay shabd kaa prayog hua he vahaan 'nyaay' se sampradaay dwaara pratipaadit siddhanton kaa hi grahan hota he
 The original book of this sect is Nyasutra which has five chapters and each chapter is divided into two temporals
 saare sutron kii sankhya 530 he
 The first chapter generally describes the 16 subjects which are detailed in the subsequent four chapters
 duusare adhyay main sanshay tathaa pramaanon kaa vivechan he
 The propounding themes of the third chapter are soul, body, senses, subjects of senses, knowledge and mind
 chaturth adhyay ichha, dukh, klesh or moksh ke swaroop kaa vivechan karte hue bhram ke swaroop tathaa avyav evam avyavi ke sambandh par bhi prakaash daalata he
 The fifth chapter discusses caste and exile
 pramaan, prameya, sanshay, prayojan, drushtaant, siddhant, avyav, tark, nirnay, vaad, jalp, vitanda, hetvabhaas, chal, jati, or nigrahasthaan in 16 vishyon ke tatvagyan se ni:shreyas kii prapti nyaayashastra main maani gai he
 Knowledge arises from these four evidences, direct, inference, subhuman and word
 vaisheshik darshan main sweekrut saat padaarthon kaa prameya main atanrbhaav ho jaataa he
 That is why the later lawyers have associated justice with Vaishyasik
 nyaay main mukhyat: vadavivaad kii paddati kaa varnan he
 How a theory is presented, how many objections can be made to the theory, how they can be avoided, these are the main manifestations of justice, it is said that Gautama was the first to prescribe a sentence with five components of inference
 Used
 greek darshanik arestu ke anusaar anumaan teen hi vaakyon main sampann hota he
 According to Vidyabhushan, the imaginary of the sentence in Indian justice has arisen from the influence of Aristotle
 parantu professor kith kaa mat he ki nyaay kii praarambhik avasthaa main greek vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav maanane kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 Gautama's imagination of the Panchavayava sentence is a product of his brain
 bhartiya darshan prasthaanon main nyaay sambhavat: sabase adhik prabhaavshaalee prasthaan rahaa he
 The principles propounded in the Nyasutras were refuted by the Buddhist Acharya Nagarjuna
 nagarjun kaa uttar dene ke liye vatsyayan ne nyaysutron par bhashya kii rachana kii
 Udyotkar wrote judicially to refute the objections made by Buddhist naïveté Dinang over Vatsyayana
 nyaayavarthik par nyaayavarthik taatparytika tathaa usapar tikaparishuddhi kii rachana kramash: vachaspati mishra or udayan ne kii
 Apart from these texts, Nyayamanjari is an independent interpretation of the Nyasutras
 navyanyay ke pravartak gangeshopadhyaay ne tathaa unke anuyaayiyon ne bhi gautam dwaara pradarshit maarg kaa anusaran karte hue anek granth likhe
 The judiciary has influenced many Indian philosophies and inspired them by offering a rationale
 nyaay hi ek aisa sampradaay he jisapar aaj bhi panditon main vishad rup se charchaa chal rahi he
 It is difficult to say whether Gautama was an theist or not because there is no clear instruction of God in his sutras
 baad main ishwar kaa pratipaadan nyaay kii ek visheshta hi ho gai
 According to justice in salvation, the soul devoid of all its qualities and remains in its pure form

 a boat or yacht is a type of small ship carried by a shank, saddle, paddle, rudder or sail
 aajkal naaven ingine se bhi chalane lagi hai or itani badi bhi banane lagi hai ki pot or nauka ke bich bhed karnaa kathin ho jaataa he
 In fact, both vessel and boat are synonyms, but often the word yacht is used to mean small and vessel big

 Boats have been mentioned in many other texts, but nowhere is the description of the nature of the boat
 isliye bade bade jahaajon kii tulana main naavon kaa praarambhik itihaas praaia: agyaat hi he
 Nowadays, looking at the primitive forms of boats, only the contours of their evolution and development can be conceived
 adivaasiyon ne idhar udhar jane or apana saamaan dhane ke liye jab nadi naale paar karne ke aarambhik prayaas kiye honge tab unhen lakdi yaa halake padaarthon kii kuch maatra baandhakar, yaa phir kisi vriksh kaa tana kolkar tathaa use pani main tairaakar, apane uddeshy main safalataa mili hogi
 In these we can consider the origin of boat or ship
 yah vivaadaaspad he ki tana kolkar banaai hui dongi pehle astitv main ai yaa pani par tairanevaale sarapat, narkul aadi kaa bedaa
 Probably the bark canoes were made even later and after that, by filling the air in leather tassels of animals, planting grass chaff, wood etc
 on it, people started crossing into the water
 saath hi saath chamade kii pansuia bhi banane lagi hongi
 These were some improved forms
 kuch bhi ho, yah ascharyajanak tathy he ki bahut dur dur deshon main sthit, aapas main kabhi bhi ek duusare se sampark main na aa sakanevaale logon ke man main alag alag, ek jaise hi vichaar utpann hue
 Initially these fleets or canoes will depend on the flow of water for their speed
 kintu jab kisi ne yah khoj kii hogi ki kisi latthe yaa chappu kii sahaayta se vah inhen icchaanusaar idhar udhar, nadi kii dhara ke aar paar, yaa pravaah ke saath, athwa ulate bhi le ja saktaa he, tab use apni safalataa par avashya hi bada harsh or garv hua hoga
 Then, while admiring the rivers, lakes and the Kutch, people must have started going to the sea off the coast sometimes in good weather
 dhire dhire prayog se uski maang badi, trutiyon kii khoj hui or sudhaar bhi sujhe
 Needed to increase speed
 bede ke chaaron ore se or uske bich main se bhi, pani uchhalkar upar aa jaataa tha, isse bhi bachanaa tha
 This speed and the need to keep the drought above, in the history of Nathu, from the beginning to the present day, has inspired the man to improve the way he invented
 kuch drushtiyon se dongi acchhee rahi, to kuch drushtiyon se bedaa
 Just as the canoe does not contain water, but it has neither the same carrying capacity as the fleet nor the stability
 naav naam se donon hi aaj tak kaam aate hai or donon hi upyogitaaon ko milakar hi bhanti bhanti kii naaven banaai gai hai
 As people learned the art of adding wooden planks, even though they were cut from axes, and were made out of a rough shape, they also started building water-repellent boats
 isamen chaude pende ke kaaran bede kii bhaanti sthery or unchi deevaaron ke kaaran dongi kii bhanti sookhaa sthaan uplabdh hue
 Gradually, its ends were made somewhat round, some pointed, some elevated, likewise

 In front of them came two methods of construction: first by making outer shells and strengthening them by placing beams and trenches inside it and first by making structures

 The principle of charge protection was discovered by Benjamin Franklin
 iske anusaar vidyut aavesh ko na to utpann kiya ja saktaa he or na hi use nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the electric charge is always preserved in the universe
 abhyaas rup main, aavesh sangrakshan ek bhautik niyam he jiske anusaar ek nishchit aaytan main vidyut aavesh main kul antar, un aaytan main aagam aavesh or us aaytan se nirgat aavesh ke antar ke ekadam baraabar hota he
 According to mathematics, this principle can be written as a continuity equation: q vidyut aavesh kii maatra he, jo ek nishchit aaytan main t samay main hota he, QIN us aaytan main aane vaali aavesh kii maatra samay t1 evam t2 ke bich or QOUT us aaytan se baahar jane vaale aavesh kii usee samay main maatra he
 Vector differential can be used to represent this principle in terms of charge density ρ and electric current density J: This statement is equivalent to a conservation of four-current
 In the mid-nineteenth century, James Clerk Maxwell postulated the existence of electromagnetic waves as a result of his discovery that Ampère's law was inconsistent with the conservation of charge
 After correctly reformulating Ampère's law, Maxwell also realized that such waves would travel at the speed of light, and that light itself must be a form of electromagnetic radiation
 See electromagnetic wave equation for a full discussion of these discoveries

 Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving Day in the US, when traditionally Christmas shopping begins
 sanyukt rajya america main vishesh rup se lokapriy is avasar kaa prachlan canada jaise anya deshon main bhi bad rahaa he
 On this day many retailers open their shops very early, often at 4
00 am or earlier and offer promotional sales to speed up the shopping opportunity
 blike friday vastav main ek chuttee kaa din nahin he, lekin bahut se niyokta apane karmchaariyon ko chuttee de dete hai jisase sambhavit kharidaaron kii sankhya bad jaati he
 Since 2005 it has regularly been the busiest shopping day of the year, although in news reports, which were not correct at the time, it has long been described as the busiest shopping day of the year
 is din ke naam kii utpatti philadelphia main hui thi jahaan mul rup se iskaa istemaal thankgiving ke agle din hone vaale paidal yatriyon or vaahanon ke baari or avarohak trephic kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The use of the term began in 1966 and its widespread use outside Philadelphia began around 1975
 baad main ek vaikalpik vyakhya kii shuruyaat hui: ki "blike friday" us avadhi ke bare main bataata he jiske dauraan khudara vikreta ek laabh kii sthiti yaa "in da blike" main aa jate hai
 Because Thanksgiving always falls on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States, the day after that falls between 23 and 29 November
 samachar media ne thankgiving ke agle din ko kaaphi lambey samay se varsh main kharidari ke sabase vyast din ke rup main bataaya he
 In the early years, this was not really the case
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1993 se lekar 2001 kii avadhi main vyavsaayik kharidari ke sabase vyast dinon kii suchi main blike friday ko paanchaven se lekar dasven sthaan ke bich rakhaa jaataa tha, jab aam taur par christmas ke pehle aane vaale shanivaar ko pehla sthaan praapt hota tha
 However, in 2003, Black Friday was actually the busiest shopping day of the year and it has maintained that position every year except 2004, when it was ranked second
 blike friday kai kaarnon ke sanyog se ek kharidari ke din ke rup main lokapriy rahaa he
 It marks the beginning of Christmas as the first day after the last major holiday before Christmas
 iske atirikt kai niyokta apane karmchaariyon ko thankgiving kii chuttee ke ek hisse ke rup main us din kii chuttee dete hai jisase kharidaaron kii sankhya bad jaati he
 In order to take advantage of this, almost all big and small retailers in the country offer different types of sale
 haal ke varshon main khudara vikritaon ko ek badhat banaae rakhane ke liye, yaa sidhe taur par pratispardhaa banaae rakhane ke liye saamaanya ghanton se aage kaam karte hue dekha gaya he
 Such hours include opening your shops at least 4
00 pm or keeping Thanksgiving Day open all night and starting selling the promotional price from midnight
 2010 main toys "aar" yuj ne apane blike friday cells kii shuruyaat thankgiving de ko raat 10

 Other retailers, such as Sears, Aeropostale and Kemart, started Black Friday sales early in the morning on Thanksgiving and continued it until 11
00 a
m
 Friday night
 Forever 21 decided to walk in the opposite direction and opened the sale at normal hours on Friday and continued till late night and worked till 2:00 am on Saturday morning
 aitihaasik rup se blike friday kii bikri ko agle saptahanth tak nirantar jari rakhana aam baat thi
 While this trend has largely disappeared in recent years, it is probably due to an attempt by retailers to create a broader sense of inevitability
 canada ke kareeb ke kai khudara vikreta aksar seemaa paar ke yatayaat ko aakarshith karte hai, isliye 2009 main canada ke kai pramukh khudara vikritaon ne kharidaaron ko america jane se hatotsahit karne ke liye prachaar abhiyaan chalaakar is din kaa apana ek alag sanskaran taiyaar kiya tha
 Canada's Boxing Day has often been compared to Black Friday in terms of retailers' influence and consumerism
 blike friday kaa udahaaran detaa ek website jo kuch saamagree apane website par bech rahaa he
 Black Friday has recently expanded to countries outside North America, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, by major online retailers such as Amazon or Apple
 ek shabd ke rup main blike friday kaa prayog kai sandarbhon main kiya gaya he; isaki shuruyaat unnisvin sadi se hui he jab sanyukt rajya america main ise 1869 ke ek vittiya sankat ke saath joda gaya tha
 The earliest known reference referring to "black Friday" as the day after Thanksgiving was made in a 1966 publication in Philadelphia on the significance of this day: janvari 1966 - "blike friday" vah naam he jise philadelphia ke police vibhaag ne thankgiving de ke baad aane vaale shuukravaar ko diya he
 It is not a word of love towards him
 "blike friday" shahar ke centre main christmas kii kharidari ke avasar kii aadhikarik taur par shuruyaat karata he or yah aam taur par baari trephic jam or footpaathon par bahut zyada bheed lekar aata he jab shahar ke vyavsaayik kshetra kii dukaane khulne se lekar band hone tak khachaakhach bhari rahati hai
 The term Black Friday began to expand widely around 1975 as shown in two newspaper articles dated November 29, 1975, both of which have Philadelphia datelines
 pehla sandarbh da neuyork times main "army varses navy: e diming splandar" sheershak se prakashit aalekh main he: Every year that day, between Thanksgiving Day and the army-navy game - Philadelphia's police and bus drivers call it "black Friday

 This derivation is also evident in an Associated Press article titled "fox on Buying Spry Dispit Down Economy", which appeared in the Titusville Herald on the same day: dukaan ke raste jam the

 Many traders objected to the use of a negative word in reference to one of the most important shopping days of the year
 1980 ke dashak kii shuruyaat tak ek vaikalpik siddhant prachaarit kiya jane laga: jo yah he ki khudara vikreta paramparaagat rup se varsh ke adhikansh hisse main apane kaarobaar ko ek vittiya nuksaan main sanchalit karte hai or chhuttiyon ke mausam ke dauraan apana munaafaa arjeet karte hai jisaki shuruyaat thankgiving ke agle din se hoti he
 When it was recorded in financial records, red ink was used to indicate a negative amount and black ink was used to show a positive amount in common accounting practices of a time
 is siddhant ke tahat blike friday us avadhi kii shuruyaat he jahaan khudara vikreta ab nuksaan nahin uthaate hai balki varsh kaa munaafaa apane ghar le jate hai
 The earliest known experiment, similar to the 1966 example above, which was discovered by Bonnie taylor-blake of the American Dialect Society, is from Philadelphia in 1981, and it is the theory of "black ink" as one of many competing possibilities

 While the 1996 film Jingle All the Way presented a dramatic comedic adaptation of the troubles people experienced in order to achieve their shopping goals on holiday, Black Friday sales in recent years a significant increase has been observed in the state of extreme disorder due to people's desires to take advantage
 2006 main ronoke, vie ke best by main kharidari karte hue ek vyakti ko duusare graahak se marpet karte hue video main record kiya gaya tha
 Unregistered shoppers of wal-mart immediately began to train at the opening doors and targeted many employees against a large number of traders
 Nine shoppers were injured in an incident involving an elderly woman who had to be taken to a hospital in a California mall when she was crowded to get a gift certificate being distributed from the roof
 2008 main neuyork ke vaili stream main lagbhag 2,000 kharidaaron kii ek bheed ne 5:00 baje sabere sthaneey waal-mart ke khulne ke liye baahar intazaar kiya tha
 As the opening hours approached, the crowd became very restless and when the doors opened, the crowd moved swiftly, breaking the door and crushing a 34-year-old employee, killing the man
 aisa nahin lag rahaa tha ki kharidaaron ko us peedit vyakti ke anjaam kii koi chintaa thi, jab anya karmchaariyon ne hastkshep karne or ghayal karmchaaree kii madad karne kii koshish kii to bheed ne apni railempel ko yah shikaayat karte hue rokane se inkaar kar diya ki ve sardi main kaaphi samay se intazaar kar rahe the or ab intazaar nahin karnaa chaahate hai

 The notion that the next day of Thanksgiving marks the "official" start of the holiday shopping occasion is likely tied to the idea of the Santa Claus parade
 thankgiving samaaroh ko manaane kii parade main aksar parade kii samaapti par is vichaar ke saath santa clos kii upasthiti shaamil hoti he ki "santa clos aa gaya he" yaa "santa bas hamaare aas-paas maujuud he"

 In the end, it has become just an unwritten rule that no store will try to advertise Christmas before the parade is over
 So the day after Thanksgiving became the day that officially begins the shopping season

 The use of Black Friday advertising tip sites in the US and going directly to shopping varies from province to province depending largely on how much shipping costs vary and sales tax is applicable in that province
 Or not However, in recent years the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border buyers who want to negotiate outside the US, especially from Canada

 He considered the development of an ideal rabbit population, assuming that: iskaa niyam yah he ki khargoshon kii ek jodi apane jivan-kaal main 2 jodi paidaa karti he or mar jaati he
 Suppose the population is f in n months
 is samay, keval ve khargosh, jo n - 2 maheene main jivit rahe the, prajnanksham hai or santan paidaa karte hai, to f jode maujuuda aabaadi f main jud jate hai
 Thus, the total is f = f + F

 The result satisfies the equation is prakaar puraa anukram he Each third number of the sequence is even and typically, each kth number of the sequence is a multiple of Fk
 Thus the Fibonacci sequence is an example of a divisibility sequence
 Indeed, the Fibonacci sequence satisfies the apparent divisibility property

 chunki fibonachi prayaavartan raikhik he, in do shrinkhalaaon ke kisi bhi raikhik sangyojan se bhi prayaavartan kaa samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 ye raikhik sangyojan, ek do-aiami raikhik vector antar taiyaar karte hai; mul fibonachi anukram is antar main paaya ja saktaa he
 The series of linear combinations φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n { \ displaystyle ^ {n}}, including the coefficients a and b, can be defined by is prakaar paribhaashit sabhi shrinkhlaayein fibonachi prayaavartan kii purti karti hai Where f a, b = 0 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 0} and f a, b = 1 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 1} yields a = 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle a = 1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} and b = - 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle give b = -1 / { \ sqrt {5}}}, resulting in the same binet formula from which we started Was It has been shown that this formula fulfills the Fibonacci alternation
 In addition, an explicit investigation can be done: or Proving the original arrival questions, certify that isliye, kinhin do praarambhik mulyon ke liye, sangyojan a, b { \ displaystyle a,b} ko is tarah paaya ja saktaa he ki falan f a, b { \ displaystyle F_{a,b} \ ,}, anukram ke liye sateek purna sutara he
 Since for all n ≥ 0 { \ displaystyle n \ geq 0} | 1 - 4 n / 5 = 0 { \ displaystyle k> = 0} is found for integers iske vipareet, Sometimes the integer sums on the inverse Fibonacci numbers can be calculated in terms of theta function
 For example, we can write the sum of every odd-exponential Fibonacci number as follows or vargakar vyutkram fibonachi sankhya ke yoga ko nimna rup main If we add 1 to each Fibonacci number in the first sum, there will also be a complete formula
 or vargakar fibonachi sankhya kaa acha vargeekrut yoga he, jo sunahare anupaat kaa vyutkram detaa he, Such results seem correct to see that a complete formula for the simple sum of inverse Fibonacci numbers can be found, but no such has yet been known

 Any consecutive three Fibonacci numbers, taking two at a time, have been proportional prime numbers: ie, or saamanytah, The divisibility of Fibonacci numbers by the prime p is related to the Legendre sign { \ displaystyle \ ; \ left} which is assumed to be as follows: agar p ek abhajya sankhya he, to f p ≡ and f p − ≡ 0 
 { \ displaystyle F_{p} \ equiv \ left{ \ pmod {p}} \ ; \ ;{ \ mbox{ and }} \ ; \ ; \ ;f_{p- \ left} \ equiv 0{ \ pmod {p}}

+F12 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144= 374 = 11×34 In fact, the identities are not only positive, but are true for all n integers: n = 0: F0 + F1 + 


 + F9 = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 = 88 = 11 × 8n = −1: F−1+F0+

 Beginning with 5, every other Fibonacci number is the length of the hypotenuse of an even triangle with integer sides, or, in other words, the largest number in the Pathagorean triangle
 The length of the long foot of this triangle is equal to the sum of the three sides of the previous triangle in this series of triangles, and the short foot is equal to the difference between the Fibonacci number taken in the preceding calculation and the short foot of the preceding triangle

 Since the conversion factor from miles to kilometers is close to the 1
609344 golden ratio, the decomposition of miles into the sum of Fibonacci numbers becomes approximately the sum of kilometers when the Fibonacci numbers are replaced by their successors
 In the transfer of base मू, the radix is equal to the number 2 indicator

iskaa sutara he Where n is the index of the floret and c is a constant ascending multiplier; In this way, the flowers are located on the spiral of the format
 The angle of deviation, adjacent to 137
51 °, is the golden angle, which divides the circle into the golden ratio
 Because this ratio is irrational, there is no one else at the same angle from the center, side of a floret, so the florets are efficiently filled together
 Because the formula for the rational approximation of the golden ratio is F: F, the index in the nearest neighborhood of the floral number n is at n ± f for j based on the distance r from the center
 It is often said that in sunflowers and similar systems 55 rotations are only in one direction and 89 in the other direction, but this is only true for a sphere of diameter, especially the outermost and thus spontaneously visible

 inamen shaamil hai: Many people of India may not even be aware that in the last few years a new branch of astrology has developed in their own country, by which the precise dates are predicted in a scientific manner, the topic of discussion among curious intellectuals
 made of
 sabase pehle dilli se prakashit honevaali patrika ‘babaaji’ ke 1994-1995-1996 ke vibhinn ankon main tathaa jyotish dham ke kai ankon main gatyaatmak jyotish ke jyotish ke buddhijivi pathakvarg ke sammukh mere dwaara hi rakhaa gaya tha
 Seeing the curiosity of the general public, in 1997, my book 'dynamic Condition Method: Planetary Influence' was introduced to the readers by a Delhi publisher 'ajay Book Service'
 is pustak kaa prakkathan likhte hue rochi college ke bhootpurv praachaarya dow vishwambhar nath pandeyyaji ne ‘gatyaatmak dasha paddati’ kii prashansa kii or asake sheeghra hi desh-videsh main charchit hone kaamana karte hue hamen jo aashirvachan diya tha, vah is pustak ke pratham or dwitiya sanskaran ke prakashit hote hi purna hota dikhaai padaa
 The popularity of this book can be gauged from the fact that the second edition of this book had to be published soon in 1999
 pustak ke prakaashan ke pashchaat har jagah ‘gatyaatmak jyotish charchaa kaa vishay bana rahaa
 This principle was presented by Shri Mahendra Maharshiji in the November 1999 issue of Kadambini magazine
 jain tii ve ke priya gold future program main bhi is paddati kii charchaa-paricharchaa hui
 Articles based on this method should be published in many newspapers in Delhi
 gatyaatmak jyotish ke vikaas kii charchaa ke aarambh main hi iskaa pratipaadan karanevaale vaigyanik jyotishi shri vidyasagar mahatha kaa parichay aavashyak hoga, jinka vaigyanik drushtikon hi gatyaatmak jyotish ke janm kaa kaaran bana
 Mahathaji was born on 15 July 1939 in Petarwar village located in Bokaro district of Jharkhand
 ek pratibhavan vidhyaarthee ken rup main mashhoor mahathaaji rochi college, rochi main bi essi karte hue apane estronami paper ke grah nakshatron main itane ram gaye ki grah-nakshatron kii chaal or unka prithvi ke jad-chetan par padanevaale prabhaav ko jaanane kii utsukata hi unke jivan kaa antim lakshya ban gayi
 His mind has no job nor brother nor any business
 inhone prakruti kii god main based apane paitruk gov main rahakar hi prakruti ke rahasyon ko dhundne kaa faisla kiya
 His eagerness towards planetary constellations inspired him to study astrology
 ganit vishay kii kushaagratha or sahitya par majboot pakad ke kaaran taatkaaleen jyotishiya patrikaon main inke lekhon ne dhooma machaayi
 In 1975, he was awarded the first prize in the All India Astrology Articles Competition by 'jyotish-martand' based on the same articles
 uske baad to jyotish-vachaspati, jyotish-ratan, jyotish-manishi jaisi oopaadhiyon se alankrita kiye jane kaa silsilaa hi chal padaa
 In 1997, in the conference held in Nabha, among the astrologers of the country and abroad, they were decorated with gold medals
 vibhinn jyotishiyon kii bhavishyavaanee main ekarupatha ke abhaav ke kaarnon ko dhundhane ke kram main inke vaigyanik mastishk ko jyotish kii kuch kamajorio drushtigat huin
 The first weakness of astrology was the strength assessment of planets
 grahon ke shakti nirdhaaran se sambandhit sutron kii adhikta bhramotpadak thi, jiske kaaran jyotishiyon ko ek nishkarsh main pahunchane main baadha upasthit hoti thi
 After studying thousands of horoscopes, he discovered the dynamic power of the planets
 grah-gati chah prakaar kii hoti he- In his study, he found that at the time of birth of a person, the very early or early planets give success to the native in his life related to his own emotions
 janm ke samay ke saamaanya or mand grah apane-apane bhaavon se sambandhit str jataka ko dete hai
 In contrast, the Vakri or extreme planets provide the person with a depressed atmosphere related to their own emotions
 1981 main surya or prithvi se kisi grah kii konik duuri se us grah kii gatyaatmak shakti ko pratishat main nikaal paane ke sutara mil jane ke baad unhone paramparaagat jyotish ko ek kamajori se chhutkaaraa dilaayaa
 The second weakness of resulting astrology was related to dashakala-fixing
 dashakaal-nirdhaaran kii paaramparik paddatiyaa trutipurna thi
 In his studies he found that according to the state of the planets mentioned in the ancient texts of astrology, his influence on human life lasts for 12-12 years
 janm se 12 varsh kii umr tak chandramaa, 12 se 24 varsh kii umr tak budh, 24 se 36 varsh k umr tak mangal, 36 se 48 varsh kii umr tak shukr, 48 se 60 varsh kii umr tak surya, 60 se 72 varsh kii umr tak brihaspati, 72 se 84 varsh kii umr tak shani,84 se 96 varsh kii umr k uranus, 96 se 108 varsh k umr tak neptune tathaa 108 se 120 varsh kii umr tak pluto kaa prabhaav manushya padataa he
 Given the definite role of different planets in a particular period, the foundation of 'dynamic condition' system was laid
 apane dashakaal main sabhi grah apane gatyaatmak or sthitik shakti ke anusaar hi fal diya karte hai
 After both of the above scientific grounds were obtained, it became quite easy to predict
 ‘ gatyaatmak dasha paddati ’ main nae-nae anubhav judye chale gaye or sheeghra hi aisa samay aayaa, jab kisi vyakti kii maatr janmatithi or janmasamay kii jaankaree se uske puure jivan ke sukh-dukh or str ke utaar-chadhaav kaa lekhachitr khinch paanaa sambhav ho gaya
 The estimation of the relative power of planets for positive and negative time information proved helpful
 bhavishyavaanea sateek hoti chali gayi or jataka main samahit vibhinn sandarbhon kii urja or uske pratifalan kaal kaa andaja lagaana sambhav dikhaai padane laga
 According to the dynamic condition method, the presence of a planet in a horoscope in a horoscope is not important, it is important its kinetic power, which remains doubtless without predicting it
 gochar fal kii gananaa main bhi graho kii gatyaatmak or sthitik shakti kii jaankaree aavashyak he
 After this information, the 'dynamic Transformation System' was developed to make dates predictions with much confidence
 gatyaatmak dasha paddati evam gatyaatmak gochar pranali ke vikaas ke saath hi jyotish ek vastuparak vigyaan ban gaya he, jiske aadhaar par saare prashnon ke uttar ho yaa nahin main die ja sakate hai
 After knowledge of dynamic astrology, religious and astrological misconceptions spread in the society can be removed, as well as helping people take appropriate decisions by keeping pace with their planets and time
 aanevaale gatyaatmak yug main nishchay hi gatyaatmak jyotish jyotish ke mahatv ko siddh karne main kargar hoga, aisa meraa vishwaas he or kaamana bhi
 But due to the neglected attitude of government, semi-government and non-government organizations towards astrology and the lack of support they can get, it will take some time to achieve this goal, no doubt
