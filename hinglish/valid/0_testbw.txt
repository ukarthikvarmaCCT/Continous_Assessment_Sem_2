 a post shared by Manish Malhotra (@manishmalhotra05) on May 3, 2018 at 4:14am PDT The results of the by-elections for the 13 wards of the MCD elections in Delhi have come and what came, may not have been expected by any side
 jo party haari, usne bhi jashn manaaya
 The one who won also burst firecrackers and who started cherishing the dream of national politics due to the power of Delhi, he also expressed happiness but hesitantly, hesitantly
 congress kii jeet se uthe sawalam aadmi party pehali baar aadhikarik taur paramasidi chunaavamein utari thi, lihaaja party ko ummiden zyada thi, vah bhi tab, jab thik dedh saal is party ne vah karishma dikhaaya tha, jaisaa pehle dilli kii raajnneeti main kabhi nahin hua
 But the results of the MCD by-election were probably not expected by the party
 lekin chunaav parinaamon ne bada sawaal yah khadaa kiya he ki dilli kii raajnneeti main congress agar phir se majboot hoti he or apane vot bank kaa waapas paane main kaamyaab rahi, to kya yah aane vaale dinon main aam aadmi party ke liye khatre kii ghanti he?is upachunaav ke kai mynedrasal, agle saal teenon emsidi ke chunaav hone hai or 2014 or 2017 ke bich is chunaav kaa mahatv isliye bhi zyada tha ki kam se kam se isse dilli keraajnneetik tapamanaka anumaan lagaana sambhav tha
 The challenge was before the three parties
 10 saal se emsidi main kabiz bijepi kii chunauti apni saakh bachaane kii thi
 The challenge before the AAP was that it had to prove that its tsunami still persisted in Delhi and the Congress had to prove that it did not end with the political veil of the capital and its strength was yet to be found
 AAP kii raah aasaan nahindilli ke is raajnneetik semifinal ke jo parinaam nikle usamen aam aadmi party ko 5 siton par, congress ko chaar par or bijepi ke teen siton par jeet mili
 Independent candidate from Bhati ward Rajendra Tanwar returned to the Congress by evening, so the Congress also claimed victory for 5 seats
 lihaaja dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki aakhir is chunaav ne kise kahaan khadaa kiya he
 If we compare the 2012 MCD elections in terms of comparison, then only comparison has to be done between BJP and Congress, because then Aam Aadmi Party was not in the race
 4 seat jitkar congress ne sabko chaunkaayalekin tulana agar 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke karen to teenon partiyon kii samiksha yaa aankalan karnaa thodaa aasaan hoga, jin 13 siton par chunaav ho rahe the, 2012 main unamem saat par bijepi thi, chaar par nirdaleey the, ek par areldi or ek bispi ke paas tha
 Of the seven seats BJP had, Karumuddin Nagar, Shalimar Bagh, Wazirpur, Matiala, Nanakpura, Bhati and Jhilmil, while Ballimaran RLD, while Bhati was with bsp's Sahiram Pahalwan
 vahiin muniraka (pramila tokes), navada (naresh baalyan), khichdipur (vinod vinni) or vikasnagar (mahendra yadav) se nirdaleey ummidavaar jite the
 The AAP was shocked by the by-election when the Aam Aadmi Party came on the political map of Delhi, the four independent counselors went to the Aam Aadmi Party
 iske alaava bijepi ke do counslar, cameruddinanagar se raghuvinder shaukeen, bhaati se kartaar singh or tehkhand se bispi ke counslar sahiram pahalwaan ne bhi aap jwine kar liya, jabaki areldi ke shoeb ikbaal congress ke saath jude hue hai
 So this time there were seven seats from where aap's credentials were directly at stake, because from there their councilors later elected and became mlas
 haalanki ansebali ke lihaaj se dekhe to in 13 vaardon main aam aadmi party ke vidhayak hai
 BJP has the highest vote percentage of 2012, 40 in these 13 wards
 99 fisadi vot mili, jabaki congress ko 27
 71 percent of the votes were received
 lekin agar 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke lihaaj se denkhe to in sabhi 13 ward main aam aadmi party ko kareeb 54
 34 percent, BJP 38 percent and Congress 6
 7 fisadi vot mili the
 But in the election results, AAP and Congress may have got five seats each, but bjp's vote percentage is around 34 percent, AAP 29
 93 fisadi or congress ko 24
 87 percent votes were received
 khaas baat yah rahi 2014 main jo raajnneetik tsunami aam aadmi party ke paksh main dekhne ko mili thi, mahaj dedh saal main agar uske mat pratishat main kareeb 24 fisadi kii giravat aati he, to vah uske liye chintaa kaa sabab jarur he
 The situation is a bit worrying for you as the AAP leaders remain silent, as the Aam Aadmi Party stood at number three in the Khichadipur seat, which falls under Manish Sisodia's Patparganj assembly
 sirf patpadganj main hi nahin, aam aadmi party jhilmil, bhaati, cameruddin nagar or shalimaar baag main bhi tisare number par rahi, inamen jhilmil seat vidhansabha adhyaksh ramanivas goyal or shalimaar baag seat vidhansabha upaadhyaksh vandana kumari ke vidhansabha seat ke antargat aati he
 So the Aam Aadmi Party celebrated the celebrations but half-heartedly
 kejariwal ne bhi badhai ke twit kaa sahaara liya, jabaki anya saare netaa bayaan dene se bachate rahe or jab dilli ke prabharee dilip pandey saamne aae, to mana ki parinaam apeksha ke anuroop nahin rahe or party isaki samiksha karegi
 The Congress had thrown the strength in front of the three parties, so in the campaign, the three parties left no stone unturned, but the Congress also put the maximum emphasis
 pehali baar dekhne ko mila ki emsidi ke upachunaav main gulam nabi aaazaad, ashok gahalot, rajbabbar sareekhe netaaon ko bhi utaara gaya
 Whereas Arvind Kejriwal took over as the first commander from the Aam Aadmi Party and had completed the campaign through almost all the wards organized by the Cultural Department before the notification
 duusare round main kaman zyaadaatar manish sisodiya, kumaar vishwaas, sanjay singh, kapil mishra or vidhayakon ke jimme rahaa
 The third side, sitting in the MCD for 10 years and facing the challenge of anti-incumbency, the BJP used its mps to campaign
 unamem bhi satish upaadhyaay, manoj tiwari, ramesh vidhudi or kuch maukon par harshavardhan bhi prachaar karte dikhe
 In fact, the issues related to the people under the Congress leader strategy were many
 For the first time in the last one year, the people of Delhi saw something that has never been seen before
 desh kii rajdhani main logon ko safaikarmiyon ko hi kooday phenkate dekha or vah bhi do-do baar
 People were upset with the stench spread near the house, scavengers were protesting for salary and were entangled in the bjp-aam Aadmi Party-led tu-tu main-main
 emsidi paisa maangati rahi, sarkaar apane tark detii rahi or dekhte-dekhte maamla court tak pahunch gaya
 When dengue spread in the capital last year and two dozen people died, people saw less solution, more fighting between AAP and BJP
 log pareshaan ho, mar rahe ho or samaadhaan kii bajaay raajnneetik bayaanbaji se baat aage na bade to asar padana swaabhaavik he
 The Congress benefited from the BJP-AAP battle
 The Aam Aadmi Party and the Chief Minister kept repeating that the only way to get rid of the corrupt MCD is to get the BJP out of the MCD
 apni lokapriyata ke bharose punjab or goa main paanv pasaarne main jute kejariwal ne yahaan tak daawa karte ghoomte rahe ki agar aaj vidhansabha chunaav hon to party vidhansabha kii baaki teenon siten bhi jeet jaaegi
 But unauthorized colony or water crisis, the common man still has to find solutions on many issues and his dissatisfaction was seen in many areas of Delhi in the last few days
 is chunaav parinaam ko agar sanket maane to 21 parliament secretary ko lekar agar chunaav ayog ne agar unki sadsyta ko lekar sawaal khadey kar die, to party kii kya sthiti hogi, use samajha ja saktaa he
 Ajay Maken's strategy rang on the other side, the Congress, which is fighting for survival, made every effort to return
 jab safaikarmiyon kaa tamaasha chalaa tab rahul gandhi unka dard baantne kadakadduma tak pahunch gaye the
 Not only this, Rahul Gandhi remained ahead even if there are problems of street vendors
 jab sultanpuri kii jhuggiyon me aag lagi or saikadon garib parivaar sadakon par aa gaye, tab bhi ajay maakan or unki team ne vahaan sakriy bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The effort was to bring back the vote bank of the Congress, which included unauthorized colony, minority, street vendors and slums and which went to the Aam Aadmi Party's court in the 2014 assembly elections and proved in this election
 That the Congress was also largely successful in this endeavor
 bijepi ke liye aage badi chunautivahin bijepi bhale hi yah kahkar khud kaa bachaav kare ki use sabase zyada vot mili hai lekin sankhya main pichhadane kaa koi thos tark party ke paas nahin he
 The party is perhaps satisfied that it has retained its hold on three traditional seats and the party is in second place in 8 places, with two seats, the margin of defeat on Matiala and Nanakpura being less than 1000 votes and next year There is a lot of need to think and think if you want to save credibility in SCD
 muslim pakshakaron ne shanivaar ko ayodhya maamle par aae supreme court ke faisle par rivyuu pitishan daakhil karne kaa faisla liya
 The decision was taken in a meeting held at the Islamic Teaching Center Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulema (nadwa College) in Lucknow
 jaankaree ke mutabik yah ek anaupchaarik baithak thi, jisamen muslim paksh ke kai bade chehre shaamil hue or supreme court ke faisle par rivyuu pitishan daakhil karne par rajamandi jataai

 The All India Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is also going to meet on Sunday on the Ayodhya matter
 board kii baithak se pehle hi kai muslim pakshakaar ayodhya par purnvichaar arji ke liye taiyaar ho gaye hai
 However, Iqbal Ansari and the Sunni Waqf Board have distanced themselves from the meeting
 babari masjid maamle main 4 vaadi mulaakaat main maujuud rahenge
 However, leaders like Firangi Mahli, Kalve Jawwad and Iqbal Ansari do not want a re-application on the verdict
 aakhri faisla ravivaar ko hone vaali aal india muslim personal lau board kii baithak main kiya jayega
 Second option of mosque not accepted: Jamiat tell that 2 days before the proposed Sunday meeting of All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya, Jamiat ulema-e-hind (JUH) had decided that for mosque 5 acres will not accept alternative land
 gyaat ho ki jeuech ayodhya maamle main ek pramukh muslim vaadi rahaa he
 During the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Jamiat ulema-e-hind (JUH) in Delhi on Thursday, the institution said that the alternative land given for the mosque is not acceptable at any cost, whether money or land
 jeuech ne supreme court ke faisle ko lekar samiksha yachika daalane kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya
 JUH President Arshad Madani said the five-member fact-finding committee would take a legal opinion on the case
 uttar pradesh jamiyat ulema-e-hind ke adhyaksh ashad rashidi ne kaha, 'kaaryakari samiti kii baithak main do mahatvapurn nirnay liye gaye
 One was related to five acres of alternative land for the mosque and the other was about the possibility of filing a review petition
 'unhone aage kaha, 'kaaryakari samiti ne sarvasammati se faisla liya he ki duniya kii kisi bhi cheez se masjid kii 'badal' (vaikalpik) nahin ho sakati he, chaahe vah paisa ho yaa jameen
 Jamiat ulema-e-hind was established in 1919

 The organization played an active role in the Khilafat Movement and the freedom struggle
 vahiin sanghathan ne vibhaajan kaa bhi virodh kiya tha
 On the morning of March 28, suddenly the mobile bell rang and from the other side, you were asked to prepare to contest the election from Maharajganj
 das minute kii is phone kol ne janimani bijness editor supriya shrinet ko netaa bana diya
 Today she is seeking votes from Maharajganj as a Congress candidate in the town of Paratapur
 supriya ke saath chand congressi netaa or unke pita ke bharosemand logon ke alaava kurta pyjama pahane pani kii bottle saath lekar khamoshi se chal rahe dhirendra hai
 Who is a vice president in a finance company but leaving Delhi, with his wife Supriya, is exploring the village, farm and barn
 pehle is seat par congress ne bahubali netaa amarmani treepathi kii beti tanushri ko tikat diya thi lekin rato raat unka tikat kaat kar supriya ko ladaane kaa faisla kiya
 a sad aspect of his family is also hidden behind this thrill of Supriya Srinet joining politics
 supriya shrinet maharajaganj ke diggaj netaa or do baar ke saansad harshavardhan singh kii beti hai
 Supriya's mother died in 2014, Supriya's brother and political heir state Vardhan Singh died in 2015
 parivaar is bade sankat se ubar paata ki 2016 main khud harshavardhan singh kii maut ho gai
 After the death of three family members in three years, Supriya has now decided to carry forward the political legacy of Harshvardhan Singh
 haalanki unke saamne badi dikkat congress ke kaaryakartaaon ko ikattha karnaa or logon ke bheetar yah ummid paidaa karnaa he ki wo loksabhaa chunaav kii majboot pratyaashee hai
 Supporters of BJP leader Haren Pathak burnt effigies of 'external candidate' and Bollywood actor Paresh Rawal on Sunday from Ahmedabad Eastern seat
 bhaajapa ne saat baar saansad rahe pathak ke sthaan par paresh rawal ko ahmedabad purvi seat se tikat diya he
 a supporter of Pathak said, 'we demonstrated at various places in Ahmedabad Eastern region and burnt effigies of external candidate Paresh Rawal
 ' dahegam kasbe ke bhaajapa pramukh chandresh patel ne kaha, 'party ne ek bahari ko tikat dekar hamaare netaa kaa apmaan kiya he
 Haren Bhai always treated us like a family
 lekin party ne unke saath sautela vyavhaar kiya he
 ' police ne dahegam ke paas kai party kaaryakartaaon ko hiraasat main le liya
 An official of the local police station said, 'we have filed a complaint against a group of people who burnt Rawal's effigies and performed without permission
 ' a local resident said, 'we want our leaders to contest the elections
 ham is seat par kisi bahari ummidavaar ke liye anumati nahin denge
 ' pichley 12 dinon se bihar kii raajnneeti main upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ko lekar gatirodh kii sthiti bani hui he ki aakhir vah apane pad se istipha denge yaa nahin ? aise main jediu ne mahagathbandhan ko ekajute rakhane or nitish kumaar ke saath gathbandhan bachaae rakhane ko lekar nayaa daanv khelaa he
 The JDU has warned Lalu that if he has to maintain the alliance, he will have to give up his stubbornness for Tejashwi
 ajtak se baatcheet karte hue jediu ke pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne kaha he ki hath dharm se gathbandhan dharm bada hota he or yah baat argedy supremeo ko samaj lenaa chahie
 Neeraj said that the alliance does not work with the politics of stubbornness
 nitish kumaar ke taraf se saaf sanket milane ke baavjood tejasvi ne pichley 12 dinon se apane upar lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon par koi bhi santoshjanak spashtikaran nahin diya he, magar jediu ko ab bhi ummid he ki isko lekar tejasvi jaldi apni sthiti spasht karenge
 It is worth noting that RJD has argued that when Union Minister Uma Bharti has not given an order while a charge sheet has been filed against her in the Babri Masjid demolition case, why should Tejashwi Yadav resign just because an FIR is lodged? But JDU termed this argument as false, saying that even though the charge sheet has been filed in the Narendra Modi government model, action will not be done but it will not be compromised on allegations of corruption in the model of Nitish Kumar government
 vahiin duusari taraf bhaajapa ne kaha he ki tejasvi yadav, nitish kii baat nahin maanakar sidhe-sidhe unke adhikaar ko chunauti de rahe hai
 BJP leader Nandkishore Yadav said that Nitish's silence on Tejashwi's issue was astonishing and that he should take immediate action against his deputy chief minister, so that his image of governance would remain intact

 Karan Johar recently shared the trailer of the film Drive
 is trailor menjacleen furnandisaurasushant singh rajputjise sitare najar aaenge
 With the release of the trailer, the film's party anthem Makhna is once again going viral
 is gane main sushant or jacleen isroyal ke tel aviv shahar main party karte hue dekhe ja sakate hai
 The special thing is that much of the cinematography of this song can also be credited to the film's lead stars as Sushant and Jacqueline can be seen shooting with a selfie stick in most of the shots of the song
 ye gaanaa is myne main bhi khaas he kyonki is tarah ke prayog cinema main isse pehle kaaphi kam hue hai
 The beauty of the city of Tel Aviv can be seen in this song
 shahar ke bichon bich drive karte jacleen,sushantaur unke dost puure gane ke dauraan party or fan main mashgool hai
 The cast of the film Dead Sea and Jerusalem City also arrived for the shoot
 sushant or jacleen kii film ko kiya jayega netflix par relisegauratlab he ki haal hi main relies hue is film kaa trailor zyaadaatar darshakon ko raas nahin aa rahaa he or kai logon ne is film ke viefex ko lekar aalochana kii he
 These critics said that the VFX used in the film is better than it is seen in many games of today's era
 vahiin kai aise bhi the jinhone ye bhi kaha ki chunki karan johar jaanate the ki ye film theatres main khaas safal nahin hogi isliye is film ko unhone sidhaa netflix par relies karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Significantly, the release date of this film, which has been in controversy for some time, has been postponed continuously
 bataa den ki sushant kii pichhali kuch filmon ne box offis par behtareen kaarobaar kiya he
 His previous film Chichhore had managed to earn over 150 crores at the box office
 samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav vidhansabha or loksabhaa gathbandhan main asafal hone ke baad ab apane chachaa shivpal yadav kii ore apana rukh kar sakate hai
 Actually, at present both need each other to save their political existence
 sapa sangrakshak bharsak prayaas he ki ek baar shivpal or akhilesh ek ho jaaen to party majboot ho jaae
 Akhilesh aligned with the Congress in 2017 to get Yadav and upper caste votes, but did not succeed there
 iske baad 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa ne saare gile shikave bhulaakar basapa ke saath yadav or dalit ke naam par gathbandhan kiya
 This experiment of Akhilesh was also not successful
 mulaayam singh yadav 2017 main congress or 2019 main basapa se gathbandhan ke virdohi rahe hai, lekin akhilesh ne unke sujhaavon ko darkinar kar diya
 According to political pundits, the nationalism and development issues of BJP have destroyed all the equations
 shuru se yadav vot kaa mul aadhaar mulaayam or shivpal hi rahe hai
 Akhilesh has not been able to make any such single position till now, due to which the entire vote bank should openly come towards him
 ab yadav vot sushasan or rashtrawaad ke naam par chhitak rahaa he
 After Shivpal's withdrawal from the party and not in Mulayam's active politics, Yadav vote bank is also moving here and there
 vah satta kii ore khisak rahaa he
 Though Shivpal's association with SP may not increase, the Yadav vote will become one and the party will also become stronger
 yahi mulaayam bhi chaahate hai yahi kaaran he ki shivpal or akhilesh ke ek hone ke sur tej hone lage hai
 However, all the political experiments of Akhilesh have failed
 shivpal ne bhi abhi na kuch khoyaa he or na hi unhen kuch mila he
 If Shivpal joins BJP, it will be difficult for Akhilesh to make the organization stand
 shaayad isiilie akhilesh chachaa shivpal singh yadav ko lekar naram dikh rahe hai
 SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said that the doors should be open for everyone
 shivpal jaanate hai ki vah sapa ke baraabar apni party ko majboot nahin kar sakate he
 That is why he would also like to be one
 ek varisht sapa netaa ne bataaya, 'akhilesh yadav party sambhaal rahe hai
 But he should understand one thing that Mulayam and Shivpal have brought him among the people
 netaji ke gaayab hone ke baad sabase zyada kaam shivpal ne kiya he
 He had a good grip on the ground
 khaskar yadav belt main vah aaj bhi majboot hai
 Those who took the SP from village to village are now with Shivpal Yadav
 ab is samay jo log sapa ke saath hai, ve log nae hai
 He has not seen the sp's struggle period
 party kii ekta or majbootee ke liye donon kaa milanaa jaruri he

 diarector madhur bhandarkar apni film 'indu sarkaar' kii vajah se ek ke baad ek vivaadon main ghire hue najar aa rahe hai
 After the censor board, Priya Singh Paul, a woman now claiming to be Sanjay Gandhi's daughter, has sent a notice to Madhur Bhandarkar that the film's trailer is misleading to the public
 notice kaa jawaab dete hue madhur bhandakar ne kaha ki sabase pehle to aap apana gandhi parivaar ke saath sambadh sabit karen or rahifilmaki baat to aisa film main kuch nahin he jo kisi kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchaata ho
 Madhur's lawyer has denied Priya Singh's claim, claiming that Priya Singh has tried to extort money from him in the name of the court
 haal hi main ek conference main priya singh ne kaha kii wo film kaa trailor dekh kar hairaan thim ki ek taraf sanjay gandhi ke role main ek aadmi kahata he ye sarkaar (chaabuk) se chalati he or duusare seen main ek mahila ko jail main faansee di jaati he or baad main balaatkaar kiya jaataa he
 Which was completely misleading
 trailor ko dekhakar ye lagata he ki ye film sanjay gandhi kii image ko puri tarah bhramit karegi

 Now let's see what is the next step of Priya Singh? bahujan samaaj party ke vidhayak haji yaqub ne inkaar kar diya he ki wo mayawati ke kehane par jaybhim kaa naaraa nahin lagaayenge
 Two days ago in the fatwa issued from darul-uloom of Deoband it was said that it is illegal for Muslims to speak Jai Bhima

 Haji Yakub is the person who announced a reward of 51 crore rupees for beheading the person who made a cartoon of Pangbar Muhammad
 
 Darul Uloom says that Mayawati should also think before invoking the slogan of Jayabheem in her rallies

 ) Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal has advocated bringing petroleum products under the ambit of Goods and Services Tax (GST), saying that this move will bring uniformity in prices of petrol and diesel across the country

 The price of petrol in Punjab is more than Rs 86 per liter and about seven rupees liter more than in Chandigarh
 rajya petrol par 36 pratishat waite (mulya varddhi kar) tathaa adhibhaar lagaataa he
 Badal said, "petroleum sector is a big sector and it is still outside the purview of GST"

" Please meet at one rate
 deshbhar main petrol-dijal kii keemten pratidin nayaa record bana rahi hai
 If the prices of petrol in the financial capital Mumbai are going to reach the level of Rs 90 per liter, then the petrol in the capital Delhi has broken the level of Rs 80 per liter
 aise main desh kaa ek aisa kshetra bhi he jahaan aaj bhi petrol-dijal kii keemat desh ke anya hisson se aadhi daron par he
 Yes, the price of petrol and diesel in this part of India is equal to those of neighboring countries and people here are not facing inflation
 GST ho lagu to turant 89 se 60 rupee litre aa jayega petrol, dijal hoga 50 capetrol-dijal kii keemton main aadhe se adhik hissaa kendra or rajya sarkaron dwaara lagaae ja rahe tex kaa he
 This is the reason that petrol is going to reach the level of Rs 90 per liter in Mumbai and is selling at the level of Rs 80 in Delhi
 jaane petrol-dijal kii keemat kaa ganitadrasal petrol or dijal kii vaastavik keemat vah he jisapar desh kii tel companiyaan pantrol pump vikritaon ko tel uplabdh karaati hai
 On Friday, the country's largest oil company Indian Oil Corporation 39 to petrol pumps
 21 rupee prati litre kii dar se petrol bechati he
 VAT and excise duty is not included in this price and on the same sale, where the common man is paying 80 rupees for a liter of petrol at the petrol pump in Delhi, then the consumer in Mumbai is paying about 90 rupees
 waite or exisepetrol kii vaastavik keemat par 19
 48 rupees is added as excise duty
 vahiin dijal par 15
 An excise duty of Rs 33 is added
 yah duty kendra sarkaar kii tex se kamai kaa hissaa banataa he
 In addition, VAT is levied at different rates in each state
 maharashtra ke mumbai main jahaan petrol kii vaastavik keemat kaa 39
 VAT is charged at 12 per cent whereas in the capital Delhi, VAT of 27 per cent is levied on the price of petrol
 haalanki kendra sarkaar or rajya sarkarein is sambhaavna ko nakaar chuki hai ki vah jald petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laaenge
 But the special thing is that in the current situation, if the prices of petrol and diesel are seen under GST, then 87 in Mumbai in one stroke
 77 rupee prati litre bik rahaa petrol lagbhag 12 se 15 fisadi sasta ho jayega
 The cheapest petrol and diesel available in this part of the country; in Delhi, the price of petrol can be reduced by about 9 percent if you look at the tax range of 28 and 18 percent of GST
 rajyon dwaara waite main katautee se kam hue petrol kii keemat ko or sasta karne ke liye kendra sarkaar bhi apane exise tex main bhi maamuli katautee kii ja sakati he
 At the same time, if the price of diesel is given at the second and third tax rate given in GST, then the price can be kept in the range of 50 rupees by reducing the price of diesel by 8 to 10 percent

 unhone likhaa, 'pichley kuch dinon main hue kuch khaas ghatnaon ne puraa bharosa dilaa diya ki sanghathan main meri sevaaon kaa sanghathan main koi mulya nahin he
 Now it seems, the more time i spend in the party, the better will be at the cost of my self-respect

 For the party, i faced a lot of hate speech and scuffle, but still no concrete action was taken against those who threatened me inside the party
 yah bahut durbhagyapurna hai
 In fact, in the past, Priyanka was in Mathura to hold a press conference on the Rafael case where some party workers allegedly misbehaved with her
 unki shikaayat par in kaaryakartaaon ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya tha
 Later, the statement issued by the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee said that the disciplinary action against them was being canceled after the workers expressed their regret

 yahaan tak jaise hi aatanki soshal media platform par apni tasviren saajha karte hai usee vakt unke bare main jaankaree jammu police tak pahunch jaati he
 After this, the coordination of the Jammu Police with the security forces has been a big part in the work of locating the location of the terrorist

 600 se zyada aatanki is vakt pioke ke lonching pad par baithe hai, lekin wo seemaa paar karne main naakaam hai
 Disgusted with the terrorists, the ISI has thought of this nefarious plan with the terrorists sitting in Pakistan, frustrated by the fact that the terrorists who came here in an attempt to carry out the crime, were targeted by the bullet before the incident
 agenciyon ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik is tarah ke inputs mili hai ki iesas ke handlerkashmiramen baithe aatankiyon se sansanikhej vaardaat karne par jor de rahe the
 Due to this, the terrorists have carried out this action

 isse aatankiyon ko mil rahi madad main kaaphi kami dikhaa aag gai di jiske chalate unke oparation ke liye log or sansaadhan jutaney main mushkilen pesh aa rahi hai
 Apart from this, the success of the recruitment campaigns for the youth of the central government for the last few years had also emphasized the mentors of the terrorists sitting in Pakistan and the ISI, due to which they want to commit such incidents so that the common Kashmiri has in mind Sit down in fear and give up on the plans of the terrorists
 aatankiyon kii is chaal ko is tarah se bhi dekha ja rahaa he kijammu-kashmirpulice ke manobal par itnaa asar daal diya jaaen ki wo kisi bhiencounterke vakt maukey par apni sakriy bhoomika ko chhod de taaki suraksha balon or aam patharbaajon ke bich sidhi muthbhed ho jaaen or aatankiyon ko propaganda karne main madad mil sake

 bharat ke uparashtrapati ke taur par apana kaarykaal samaapt hone ke baad hamid ansaari dwaara alpsankhyakon ko lekar die gaye bayaan ke baad ve ab aalochakon ke nishane par aa gaye hai
 While political parties are raising questions about his statement and time, Islamic scholars and historians are also condemning Hamid Ansari's statement
 moulana abul kalam aaazaad ke parpote or khud ko hamid ansaari kaa dost kehane vaale islamic vidwaan firoz bakht ahamed ne hamid ansaari ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki vah award vaapasi gang ke raste par chal rahe hai
 Feroz Bakht Ahmed said, "hamid Ansari is his friend and he respects him a lot
 bahut kaabil aadmi hai, lekin maje kii baat yah he ki jis tun or turn over main unhone yah baat rakhi he kanuunan sahi hogi lekin mujhe aisa lagata he ki ve award vaapasi gang kii bhashaa bol rahe hai
 Regarding his controversial statement, Feroze Bakht Ahmad not only questioned his statement but also questioned the time at which he has given the statement
 ahamed ne kaha ki ve 10 saal offis main rahe or aakhri do saalon main hi unako yah baaten yaad ain? yah sab baaten to congress ke raaj main bhi thim
 Why did the last 8 years not speak? Did he fear that someone would sneak up on him? They have full freedom to express their views but they understand that this is not the right time at which they have said this
 aisa mahasoos ho rahaa he ki jab wo apana kaarykaal khatm kar rahe hai to distress hai or frestrated hai isliye unhone baat kahi he"gauratlab he kihamid ansariab se pehle bhi sahishnutaa ko lekar bayaan de chuke hai
 Islamic scholar Feroz Bakht Ahmad says that they consider it utter nonsense that there is intelligence in India
 ikkaa-dukka harakatein hoti rahi hai
 Every community has been associated with it
 hindu, muslim, sikh or isaai ke bich kahin na kahin kuch gadabad hoti rahi he
 The fringe group, whether it is fraternity and Hindu brothers, is from the Muslim brothers
 frinz group jo 1-2 pratishat se zyada nahin hota he, vahaan gadabad hoti rahi he lekin uske aadhaar par yah kah dena ki hindustan intolerant he yah galat he
 Condemning the killings in the name of cow protection, Ahmed said that 32 people have died so far in the name of cow protection
 ve samajhate hai ki yah thik nahin he or sabhi ko milakar aawaaj uthaani chahie
 Muslims should also raise their voices, Hindus should also raise their voices
 kerala main RSS ke log maare gaye uske liye musalmaan bhi aawaaj uthaaen
 Feroze Bakht Ahmed also said that they are more Hindustani than Hindus and Muslims
 chaahe vah purv uparashtrapati hon yaa koi bhi ho sabhi ko dhyaan rakhana he ki hindu muslim ek ganga jamuna kii tahjeeb he jaise ham rahete chale aae hai or hamen usee ko aage chalaa kar rakhana he
 Hindustan will go on like this
 koi bhi raashtrapati yaa pradhanmantri bane, ganga jamuni tahjeeb hi chalegi

 utekara post shared bykriti(@kritisanon) onfeb 27, 2019 at 11:48pm PST Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh met Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday to discuss various issues, including making Ganga Nirmal

 We have discussed how to make Ganga continuous
 unhone kaha ki hamane tay kiya he ki main or akhilesh har do maheene main kam se kam ek baar mulaakaat karenge or kaam kii gati ko badhaane ke kadamon par vichaar-vimarsh karenge
 Ramesh accused the erstwhile Mayawati government of being negligent on various development projects and hoped that the environmentally conscious Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav would work better
 unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh main sirf ghotaalaa hi dikh rahaa he
 i am the Minister of Rural Development for about 10 months

 The verbal war between Congress leaders and Anna Hazare is not new

 Abhishek Manu Singhvi has also resigned from the post of party spokesperson due to the alleged CD scandal, but still the controversy is not giving up
 ab anna hajaare ke bayaan ne aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya he
 By the way, Anna Hazare's anger is also not needless
 abhishek manu singhvi lokapal ke liye bani standing cameti ke adhyaksh rahe hai
 Now the anger of not bringing Anna Janlokpal is on Abhishek Manu Singhvi
 anna hajaare ke bayaan se thandi pad rahi sidi cond kii aag phir dadhak uthi he
 It is evident that this fire, which was blown by Anna's statement, is not going to cool down so soon

 Anurag's mind is slowly becoming a place for inspiration
 wo nahin chahta ki prerana, naveen se shaadi kare
 However, till now the TRP of the show has not been as predictable
 darshakon ko anuraag-prerana kii lav story se kaaphi zyada ummiden thim
 It is being speculated that the entry of Komolika will see a jump in the TRP of the show
 prerana or anuraag ke role main erika or parth hai
 Hina Khan's look has been kept very stylish
 saal khatm hone ko he or ab har kisi kaa dimag chhuttiyaan manaane kaa kaarykram bana rahaa he
 So the time has come to make plans to roam the internet and make the most profitable flight and hotel deals
 iske liye aapako yahaan kuch upyogi tips die ja rahe hai
 Keep your search secret, you can get a very profitable deal by secretly searching for the same flight
 desktop ke sabhi broujar or smartphone par ek gupt mod (incognito mode) hota he
 Fares are increased based on search history
 aapako sahi flite mil jaati he par aap use book karne main kuch ghanton kii deree kar dete hai yaa agle din book karte hai to kiraaya bad jaataa he
 Search all travel search engines while searching for the most suitable flight to compare all search engines so that you get the cheapest flight
 kai search injanon kaa istemaal karnaa acha tarika he kyonki isse aap manmutabik sauda paa sakate hai
 You should also visit the airline's website as fares may vary
 agrim booking karaeichha he agar aap bahut pehle hi hawaii tikat book kara len kyonki yatra kii taarikh nikat aane ke saath kiraaya bahut bad jaataa he
 If you want to save on fares, you should book your tickets two to three months in advance
 saptaah ke bich main karen safarsaptaah ke bich main vimaan yatra karnaa saptahanth ke mukaable sasta padataa he, haalanki chhuttiyon ke sijan main aisa nahin hota he
 Avoid the busiest timed flights because then the fare increases greatly due to increased demand
 der raat yaa bahut subah vaali flite book karaate hai to kiraye main bachat kar sakate hai
 Booking a flight ticket between midnight and two in the night is most beneficial
 airline ke ank jutaayengine logon ko baar-baar safar karnaa hota he, unhen airline kii ore se puraskaar ke taur par milane vaale ankon ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 These points are accumulated in every journey and after having a fixed number, you can travel for free
 yah phydemand ho saktaa he
 Package Deal Package package may be the best option
 online travel operataron kii ore se die jane vaale flite-hotel ke package kii agrim booking kara leni chahie
 This can save a lot of money
 in packejon main flite kaa tikat, hotel main rukne va jalpan, airport se hotel tak aana-janaa or darshneey jagahon ko ghumana shaamil hota he
 Operators buy a large number of tickets long before the season starts, giving them the cheapest hotel deals
 flite kaa nirastikarnagar aap yatra kaarykram ko lekar nishchit nahin hai to rifundable tikat book karaaen
 If you had to cancel the program by doing this, there would not be much loss in the fare
 dhyaan rakhen ki sabase saste tikat rifundable nahin hote hai
 If the ticket had to be canceled, only tax would be refunded
 lekin thode mahange tikat rifundable hote hai
 If you change the date of travel, then the difference of fare of both dates has to be paid
