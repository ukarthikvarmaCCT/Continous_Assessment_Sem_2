 After this it was carried forward by the successors of the Delhi Sultanate and finally in 1526, it was gained by Babur's victory
 haalanki babarnama 1526-30 main likhaa gaya tha, parantu iske strot gyaat nahin hai
 He has not always called this diamond with its current name
 balki ek vivaad ke baad yah nishkarsh niklaa ki babar kaa hira hi baad main kohinoor kahalaaya
 Both Babur and Humayun have written about the origin of Babur's diamond in their autobiographies
 yah hira pehle gwalior ke kushwaha shaskaon ke paas tha, jinase yah tomars raajaaon ke paas pahunchaa
 The last Tomar Vikramaditya was defeated by Alexander Lodhi, and subjugated him, and kept himself captive in Delhi
 lodhi kii mughalon se haar ke baad, mughalon ne uski sampatti luti, kintu rajkumaar humayu ne madhyasthata karke uski sampatti waapas dilava di, balki use chhudvaa kar, mewar, chittod main panaah lene diya
 In exchange for this goodness of Humayun, Vikramaditya gave his precious diamond, which was probably Kohinoor, to Humayun
 parantu humayu kaa jivan ati durbhagyapurna rahaa
 He lost to Sher Shah Suri
 suri bhi ek top ke gole se jal kar mar gaya
 His son and successor Jalal Khan was killed by his brother-in-law
 us saale ko bhi uske ek mantri ne takhtapalat kar hataa diya
 That minister also won a battle, he lost due to an eye injury, and lost the Sultanate
 humayu ke putr akbar ne yah ratna kabhi apane paas nahin rakhaa, jo ki baad main sidhe shahjahan ke khajaane main hi pahunchaa
 Shah Jahan was also overthrown by his son Aurangzeb, who also killed his other three brothers
 shahjahan ne kohinoor ko apane prasiddh mayur-singhaasana main jadvaya
 His son Aurangzeb imprisoned his father in Agra Fort
 yah bhi katha he, ki usne kohinoor ko khidki ke paas is tarah rakhaa, ki uske andar, shahjahan ko usamen tajmahal kaa pratibimb dikhaayi de
 Kohinoorumuglo remained until the invasion of the Iranian ruler Nadir Shah in 1739
 usne agra va dilli main bhayankar lutpaat kii
 He looted Kohinoor and immovable property including Peacock Throne
 is heere ko praapt karne par hi, nadir shah ke mukh se achaanak nikal padaa: koh-i-nur, jisase isko apana vartmaan naam mila
 Prior to 1739, no reference to this name is known
 kohinoor kaa moolyankan, nadir shah kii ek katha se miltaa he
 His queen said that if a powerful human, throwing five stones in all four directions, and upwards, with full power, then the empty space between them, if filled only with gold and jewels, would be worth it
 
 san 1747 main, nadir shah kii hatya ke baad, yah afghanistan ke ahamed shah abdali ke haathon main pahunchaa
 In 1830, Shuja Shah, then ruler of Afghanistan, somehow escaped along with Kohinoor; And reached Punjab, and presented the diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 iske badalen swaroop, ranjit singh ne east india company ko, apni tukadiyaan afghanistan bhej kar, afgaan gaddi jeet kar, shah shuja ko waapas dilaane ke liye taiyaar kar liya tha
 Ranjit Singh, had proclaimed himself the Maharaja of Punjab
 1839 main, apni mrityu shayya par usne apni vasiyat main, kohinoor ko puri, urisa prasiddh shri jagannatha, mandir ko daan dene ko likhaa tha
 But a dispute arose about his last words and ultimately he could not be fulfilled
 29 march,1849 ko lahore ke kile par british dhvaj fahraaya
 In this way Punjab was declared a part of British India
 lahore sandhi kaa ek mahatvapurn ang nimna anusaar tha:"koh-i-nur naamak ratna, jo shah-shuja-ul-mulk se maharaja ranjit singh dwaara liya gaya tha, lahore ke maharaja dwaara england kii maharani ko saunpa jaayegaa
 " is sandhi kaa prabharee governor general the, lord dalhauzi, jinaki kohinoor arjan kii chaah, is sandhi ke mukhya kaarnon main se ek thi
 His work in India has always been a subject of controversy, and the act of acquiring Kohinoor has been criticized by many British commentators
 haalanki, kuch ne yah bhi prastaav diya, ki heere ko maharani ko sidhe hi bhent kiya janaa chaiye tha, bajaay chhine jane ke; kintu dalhaizi ne ise yuddh kaa munafa samajha, va usee prakaar saheja
 Later, Dalhousie, in 1851, arranged for an offering to Queen Victoria by Dalip Singh, the successor of Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 teraa varshiya, dalip ne england kii yatra kii, va unhen bhent kiya
 This offering was the final instance of a gem being transferred as a cargo of war
 1851 main, landan ke hide park main ek vishaal pradarshnee main, british janata ko ise dikhaaya gaya
 There were some changes in the gemstone's erosion, which made him look more beautiful
 1852 main, victoria ke pati prince albert kii upasthiti main, heere ko punah taraasha gaya, jisase vah 186 1 / 6 carat se ghat kar 105
602 carat kaa ho gaya, kintu isaki abha main kai guna badhottaree hui
 Albert put his immense effort into this work, introducing intelligence, with good advice, as well as the then 8000 pounds, which reduced the weight of the gem by 42%, but Albert was still dissatisfied
 heere ko mukut main anya do hajaar hiron sahit jadaa gaya
 Later, it was inlaid with the main gemstone of the kirit of the Maharaja's wife
 maharani alexandria ise prayog karne vaali pratham maharani thim
 He was followed by Queen Mary
 1936 main, ise maharani elizabeth ke kirit kii shobhaa banaaya gaya
 In 2002, it was decorated over his coffin
 duniya ke sabase durlabh or beshkeemtee heere 'kohinoor' kii britain kii maharani ke mukut tak pahunchne kii daastaan mahabharat ke kurukshetra se lekar golkunda ke garib majdoor kii kutiyaa tak faili hui he
 Apart from historical events, there are many stories and legends about where the unique Kohinoor originated in the world, crowned in the crown of the Queen of Britain and capable of enticing the hearts of many of the world's kings
 yah hira anek yudhon, sazishon, laalach, raktapaat or jai-paraajayon kaa sakshi rahaa he
 Kohinoor diamond is the king of all the diamonds in the world
 isaki kahani bhi pari kathaon se kam romaanchak nahin he
 There is no certified information about the birth of Kohinoor, but the first mention of Kohinoor was found 3000 years ago
 iskaa naata shri krishna kaal se bataaya jaataa he
 According to the Puranas, the Swantak Mani was later called Kohinoor
 ye mani surya se karn ko phir arjuna or yudhisthir ko mili
 Then Ashok, Harsha and Chandragupta got this gem
 san 1306 main yah mani sabase pehle malwa ke maharaja ramdev ke paas dekhi gayi
 After defeating the Maharaja of Malwa, Sultan Alauddin Khilji captured Mani
 babar se peedhee dar peedhee yah bemisaal hira antim mughal badshaah aurangzeb ko mila
 The 'jewels of Bitrain' believes that around 1655 Kohinoor was born to Kohinoor Khan in Golconda district of Hindustan
 tab heere kaa vajan tha 787 carat
 It was given to Shah Jahan by the mine owners as a gift
 san1739 tak hira shahjahan ke paas rahaa
 Then it went to Nadir Shah
 isaki chakachudhan chamak dekhakar hi nadir shah ne ise kohinoor naam diya
 The last Hindustani to hold Kohinoor was Ranjit Singh of Punjab
 san 1849 main punjab kii satta hathiyaane ke baad kohinoor angrejon ke haath lag gaya
 Then in 1850, East India Company presented the diamond to Queen Victoria
 england panhuchate-panhuchate kohinoor kaa vajan keval 186 rah gaya
 Prince Elvet, jeweler of Queen Victoria, harvested and polished the Kohinoor
 san 1852 se aaj tak kohinoor ko vajan 105
6 hi rah gaya he
 In 1911, the Kohinoor was inlaid in Queen Mary's Sartaj
 or aaj bhi usee taj main he
 It has been kept for exhibition in the 'tower of London' museum in London
 is heere kii labi katha ke baad, kai desh isapar apana daawa jataate rahe hai
 In 1976, Pakistan's Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto requested British Prime Minister Jim Callaghan to return to Pakistan, which he answered in a meek "no"
 
 anya daawa bharat ne kiya tha
 And Iran

 Shortly after independence, India has asserted its ownership over Kohinoor several times
 maharaja dilip singh kii beti catherine kii san 1942 main mrityu ho gayi thi, jo kohinoor ke bhartiya daawey ke sambadh main thos daleelein de sakati thi
 Translation request bharat kii golkunda kii khaanon se kohinoor ke alaava bhi duniya ke kai beshkeemtee heere nikle
 There are no such diamonds like Great Mughal, Orlov, Agra Diamond, Ahmedabad Diamond, Brolity of India, which are as valuable as Kohinoor
 sanchika sthanantaran protocol ek network protocol hota he jiske dwaara internet aadhaarit tisipi / ypi network par sanchikaon kaa aadan-pradaan kiya jaataa he
 This is used by user based code or anonymous user access
 ab lagbhag har santhaan main apatpi sarwar hone se, yah vyavastha kaam main nahin aati he
 Many recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers
 isse dur-daraaj se aane vaali sanchikaon par local filon jaisaa hi kaary ho saktaa he
 FTP URL is used in this
 sanchika bhejne ke anya tareeke jaise esaftipi or esasipi apatpi se nahin jude hote
 SSH is used throughout their process
 file transfar protocol yaa apatpi apane vartmaan rup main vibhinn charnon se hota hua pahunchaa he
 It was first formulated as RFC 114 on 16 April 1971 which was later replaced with RFC 765 in June 1980 which was converted from RFC 959 in October 1985
 uske baad anek suraksha sambandhi badlaav isamen aae
 These security changes were brought about because initially this method of sending files was very insecure
 is asuraksha kaa pramukh kaaran tha ki sanchika bhejne kii prakriya main koi bhi usee network par us file ko chura yaa nakal kar saktaa tha
 Prior to HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet, this was a common problem faced by Internet protocols
 is samasya kaa nivaaran esaftipi ke dwaara hi sambhav hua
 FTP can be operated in active mode, passive mode and extended passive mode
 refsi 2428 dwaara sitambar 1998 main, vistrut niskriy mod joda gaya tha
 When transferring data over the network, multiple data representations can be made
 do sarvaadhik saamaanya antaran mod hai: FTP server return codes indicate their status by their inner digits
 mul afatipi vinirdesan, sanchikaon ke antaran kii swaabhaavik asurakshit paddati he, kyonki ancrypted dhang se data antarit karne kii koi nirdisht vidhi nahin he
 This means that under most network configurations, usernames, passwords, FTP commands and transferred files can use any packet detector located on the same network using a packet detector
 yah achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet jaise esasail ke nirmaan se pehle likhe gaye kai internet protocol vinirdeshon ke liye aam samasya rahi he
 The common solution for this problem is SFTP, or FTPS, which adds SSL or TLS encryption to FTP in the manner specified in RFC 4217
 afatipi seva pradaan karne vaala ek host, atirikt rup se anaam afatipi pahunch uplabdh karaane main sakasham hota he
 When asked for a username, users normally log in to an 'anonymous' account service
 yadhyapi aam taur par prayoktaaon ko password ke evaj main apana i-mail pataa bhejne ke liye kaha jaataa he, to aapurit jaankaree kaa satyaapan thodaa-bahut yaa bilkul nahin kiya jaataa he
 Since modern FTP clients typically hide the anonymous login process from the user, FTP clients can supply fake data as passwords because the application may not know the user's email address
 gofar protocol ko or saath hi saadhaaran fil antaran protocol or fil seva protocol ko bhi, anaam afatipi ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main sujhaayaa gaya he
 Where FTP access is not in use, remote or remote FTP or FTP mail is used
 isamen ek email duusare apatpi sarwar par bheja jaataa he jo apatpi cmand puri karata he or downlod sanchika vaali anulgnak waapas bhejtaa he
 This is especially used where FTP access is restricted
 doorvarti afatipi sarwar ko nishpadit kiye jane vaale afatipi cmand yukt i-mail bheja jaataa he
 It is a mail server that parses incoming e-mail, executes FTP commands and sends back e-mails with a file downloaded as an attachment
 yah spasht rup se ek afatipi client se kam lacheela he, kyonki nirdeshikaon ko parsparik kriya karte yaa adeshon ko sanshodhit karte hue nahin dekha ja saktaa he or uttar main bade sanchika anulagnkon ko mail sarwar ke madhyam se nikalne main bhi samasya ho sakati he
 These days most Internet users have easy access to FTP, so this process is not popular in day-to-day use
 vartmaan main aadhunik or haal hi ke web brouzar or file prabandhak, afatipi sarvaron se jud sakate hai, haalanki unamem apatpies jaise protocol vistaar ke liye samarthan kii kami ho sakati he
 This allows the interface, such as the interface used for local files, to be used to switch remote files over FTP
 yah ek afatipi yuarel ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It occurs as: vaikalpik rup se yuarel main password diya ja saktaa he, udaa
: Most web browsers require passive mode FTP, which not all FTP servers are capable of accomplishing
 kuch brouzar keval sanchikaon ko downlod karne kii anumati dete hai, par sarwar main sanchikaon ko aplod karne kaa koi saadhan uplabdh nahin karaate hai
 Representation of port numbers on IP addresses and port commands and PASV reply is another challenge for network address translation tools in dealing with FTP
 eneti upkaran dwaara in maanon ko badalanaa padataa he, taaki ve nat-ed client ke ai-pi pate or data conection ke liye NAT upkaran dwaara chune gaye port ko shaamil karen
 The new address and port may differ from their original address and port in the length of their decimal representation
 iskaa arth yah he ki NAT upkaran dwaara sabhi parvarti packeton ke liye tisipi anukram or pavati fildon ko badalte hue, niyantran conection par maan ko saavdhaanee se badla janaa chahie
 Such translations are not typically performed in most NAT devices, but special application-level gate-ways are available for this purpose
 SSH kii apeksha afatipi ek esaech conection kii apeksha saamaanya afatipi satr ketnal banane ke prayog ko sanderbhit karata he
 FTP uses more than one TCP connection, so tunneling over SSH is particularly difficult
 kai esaech clienton ke saath, niyantran channel ke liye tunnel taiyaar karne kaa prayaas keval channel kii raksha karegaa; jab data sthanantarit hota he, donon chor par afatipi software tisipi conekshnon ko sthapit karenge, jo esaech conection se baahar upmarg par guzarenge or is tarah gopneeyata, akhandta sangrakshan, aadi nahin rahegi
 Otherwise, SSH client software requires specific knowledge of the FTP protocol and monitoring and rewriting FTP control messages and autonomously opening new forwarding for FTP data channels
 esaech sanchaar suraksha ke software parikr kaa sanskaran 3 or jeepiel dwaara licensokrut echoensi, aise do software package hai, jo is vidha kaa samarthan karte hai
 FTP over SSH is sometimes referred to as secure FTP; It should not be considered another method of securing FTP like SSL / TLS
 SSH kaa upyog karte hue sanchikaon ko sthanantarit karne ke anya tareeqon main shaamil hai esafatipi or esasipi, jo afatipi se sambandhit nahin hai; inamen se prayek main, puraa vaartalap hameshaa SSH protocol dwaara surakshit he

 sikh dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Sikhism is a monotheistic religion
 is dharm ke anuyaayi ko sikh kaha jaataa he
 The religious text of Sikhs is Sri Adi Granth or Gyan Guru Granth Sahib
 aamtaur par sikhon ke 10 satgur maane jate hai, lekin sikhon ke dharmik granth main 6 guruon sahit 30 bhagaton kii bani he, jin kii saamaan sikhyaon ko sikh maarg par chalane ke liye mahatvapurn mana jaataa ha
 The religious place of Sikhs is called Gurdwara
 1469 isvi main punjab main janme nanak dev ne gurmat ko khoja or gurmat kii sikhyaon ko desh deshaantar main khud ja ja kar failaayaa tha
 The Sikhs consider him their first guru
 gurmat kaa parchaar baaki 9 guruon ne kiya
 The 10th Guru Gobind Singh Ji preached to the philanthropic Khalsa to acidify the teachings of the Guru Granth Sahib
 sant kabir, dhana, sadhana, ramanand, paramanand, namdev itiyadi, jin kii bani aadi granth main darj he, un bhagaton ko bhi sikh satguruon ke saamaan maanate hai or un ki sikhyaon par amal karne ki koshish karte hai
 Sikhs believe in a single God, whom they call one-onkar
 unka maananaa he ki ishwar akaal or nirankaar he
 The Sikh Panth has a sacred and unique place in India, the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev is the originator of Sikhism
 unhone apane samay ke bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt kuprathaon, andhvishwaason, jarjar roodhiyon or pakhandon ko dur karte hue 
 He founded Sikhism on the firm foundation of love, service, hard work, philanthropy and brotherhood
 tajjub nahin ki ek udaaravaadi drushtikon se gurunanak dev ne sabhi dharmon kii achchhaayiyon ko samahit kiya
 His main precept was that God is one, He created all
 hindu musalmaan sabhi ek hi ishwar kii santan hai or ishwar ke liye sabhi samaan hai
 He has also told that God is true and man should do good deeds so that he does not have to be ashamed in the court of God
 gurunanak ne apane ek sabad main kaha he ki pandit pothee padhate hai, kintu vichaar ko nahin boojhte
 Teaches others, this makes their business of Maya
 unki kathani juthi he, ve sansar main bhatakate rahete hai
 They have no idea of the essence of couplet
 ye pandit to vaad-vivaad main hi pade rahete hai
 Guru Arjun Dev even goes so far as to say that God is pervasive like fire is absorbed in all vegetation and ghee is absorbed in milk
 isi tarah paramatma kii jyoti oonch-neech sabhi main vyaapt he paramatma ghat-ghat main vyaapt he- To make Sikhism strong and Maryadasampada, Guru arjun-dev did a huge historical and eternal work by editing the Adi Granth
 unhone aadi granth main paanch sikh guruon ke saath 15 santon evam 14 rachanakaaron kii rachanaaon ko bhi sasamman shaamil kiya
 The names of these five gurus are - Guru Nanak, Guru Angaddev, Guru Amardas, Guru Ramdas and Guru Arjun Dev
 sheikh farid, jayadev, trilochan, sadhana, namdev, veni, ramanand, kabir, ravidaas, peepa, saitha, dhanna, bheekhan, parmanand or surdaas 15 santon kii vaani ko aadigranth main sangrahit karke guruji ne apni udaar maanavtaavaadi drushti kaa parichay diya
 Not only this, he ranked the compositions of 14 creators like Haribans, Balha, Mathura, Gaynd, Nalh, Bhalla, Salh Bhikkha, Kirat, Bhai Mardana, Sundardas, Rai Balwand and Satta Doom, Kalsahar, Jalap and gave them a high status
 did
 yah adbhut kaary karte samay guru arjuna dev ke saamne dharm jati, kshetra or bhashaa kii kisi seemaa ne avrodh paidaa nahin kiya
 He knew that all these gurus, saints and poets have the same cultural, ideological and thinking base
 ullekhneey he ki guru arjunadev ne jab aadigranth kaa sampaadan-kaary 1604 i
 main purna kiya tha tab usamen pehle paanch guruon kii vaniyan thim
 After this Guru Gobind Singh finalized the Adigranth by incorporating the voice of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur
 aadi-granth main 15 santon ke kul 778 pad hai
 Of these 541 are from Kabir, 122 from Sheikh Farid, 60 from Namdev and 40 from Sant Ravidas
 anya santon ke ek se chaar padon kaa aadi granth main sthaan diya gaya he
 It is worth noting that these compositions stored in Adi Granth are completely safe without any change for more than 400 years
 lekin apane dehavsaan ke purv guru govind singh ne sabhi sikhon ke aadhyatmik maargdarshan ke liye guru granth sahab or unke sansaarik disha-nirdesan ke liye samooche khalsa panth ko ‘guru pad’ par asin kar diya
 At that time Adigranth came to be accepted as Guru Sahib
 sikh dharm ko kaaljayi banane ke liye guru govind singh ne sabhi dharmon or jatiyon ke logon ko guru-shishy-parampara main dikshit kiya
 He created this new human being for centuries to come
 yah nayaa manushya jatiyon evam dharmon main vibhakt na hokar dharm, maanav evam desh ke sangrakshan ke liye sadaiv katibaddh rahane vaala he
 This structure of taking everyone along is, no doubt, the Sikh psyche
 phir, sikh dharm kaa param lakshya maanav-kalyaan hi to he
 Perhaps to teach the lesson of this human welfare, Guru Govind Singh wrote a long letter to Aurangzeb, which mentions the praise of God as well as the poignant mention of injustice and atrocities that took place during Aurangzeb's reign
 is patr main nek karm karne or maasoom praja kaa khun na bahaane kii naseehaten, dharm evam ishwar kii aad main makkaari or jhooth ke liye chetavanee tathaa yoddha kii tarah maidan jang main aakar yuddh karne ke liye lalkaar he
 It is said that Aurangzeb's rage arose after reading this letter and after that he did not live long
 guru ji se ek baar bhent karne kii uski andaruni ichha bhi puri na ho saki
 It is not a credit to be given that the values on which the simple, simple, simple and natural life of the Sikh Gurus was based, they had certainly adopted those values from the traditional Indian consciousness
 desh, kaal or paristhitiyon kii maang ke anusaar unhone apane vyaktitv ko dhalkar tatkaaleen rajnatik, saamaajik, dharmik, aarthik evam saanskrithik jivan ko gahare main prabhavit kiya tha
 Sikh Gurus influenced the religion and social order of their time
 sikh guruon ne apane samay ke dharm or samaaj-vyavastha ko ek nai disha di
 He removed devotion, knowledge, worship, spirituality and philosophy from a narrow circle and brought the society among those who were completely deprived of it
 isse logon kaa aatmbodh jaagaa or unamem ek nai drushti evam jagriti panpi, ve swanubhoot anubhav ko manyata dene lage
 In this way the flow of the formless ultimate power was intensified and quickly received
 sikh dharm kii ek anya marke kii vishistataa yah he ki sikh guruon ne manushya ko udhyam karte hue jivan jeene, kamaate hue sukh praapt karne or dhyaan karte hue prabhu kii prapti karne kii baat kahi
 He believed that a person who works hard remains free from all worries
 guru nanak ne to yahan tak kaha he ki jo vyakti mehnat karke kamata he or usamen kuch daan-punya karata he, vahi sahi maarg ko pahachaanata he
 The 'langar' system introduced by Sikh Gurus is an example not found elsewhere in cosmopolitanism, human love, equality and generosity
 sikh guruon ne kabhi na murajhaane vaale saanskrithik evam naitik mulyon kii bhi sthapana kii
 He had foreseen with his philosophical and spiritual thinking what the time would be like
 isliye unhone andhi nakal ke khilaaf vaikalpik chintan par jor diya
 Physical practice and humor is considered to be an essential part of life
 punjab ke lokgeeton, lokanrutyon evam hola mahallaa par shastradhariyon ke pradarshit kartabon ke mul main sikh guruon ke prerana-beej hi hai
 The roots of these folk songs and folk dances erupt from the soil of Punjab and cause panic among the people
 bhangada or giddha punjab kii saanskrithik shaan hai, jisaki dhadkan desh-videsh main praaia: suni jaati he
 Punjabi culture is the backbone of nationality
 iske praan main ekatv he, iske rakt main sahanubhuti, sahyog, karunaa or maanav-prem he
 Punjabi culture connects man and builds his identity
 vishwa ke kisi kone main ghumta-phirata punjabi swayan main se ek laghu punjab kaa praturup he
 Every Sikh has his or her own independent consciousness, which has been seriously thinking about solving life-related problems in its own light
 sikh guruon kaa itihaas uthaakar dekh lijie, unhone samrajyavaadee avadharana katai nahin banaai, ulte saanskriti, k dharmik evam aadhyatmik saamanjasy ke madhyam se maanavtaavaadi sansar kii drushti hi karte rahe
 The people of this earth have maintained a peaceful existence in pre-independence India , despite the indo-pak Partition and the subsequent decades of violent violence and brutal demolition in Punjab 
 kaundh inkaa maargdarshan karti rahi he
 Sikhs have ten gurus
 shri guru granth sahib ji sikhon kaa dharmik granth he
 Sikhism begins with "one"
 sikhon ke dharm granth main "ek" kii hi vyakhya hai
 One is known by the names of Nirankara, Parbrahma etc
 nirankaar kaa swaroop shri gurugranth sahib ke shuruyaat main bataaya he jisko aam bhashaa main 'mul mantra' kehete hai
 Almost all religions worship this "one", but the various stages of "one" are mentioned and explained in Shri Guru Granth Sahib ji is unique in itself
 jeev aatma jo niraakaar he, us ke paas nirankaar ke sirf 4 hi gun vyaapt he As soon as the other four qualities are attained, the living soul goes back to Nirankar, but in order to attain it, it is necessary for the living soul to understand itself through the knowledge of Gurmat
 ise sikh dharm main "aatam chintan" kaha jaataa he
 The formless form of the soul is known in the basic Sikhs of Sikhism
 in kii gatividhion ko samaj kar insaan khud ko samaj saktaa he
 Sikhism begins with soul knowledge
 aatma kya he? kaha se ai he? vajood kyon he? karnaa kya he itihaadi ruhaniyat ke vishe sikh prachaar dwaara padhaaye jate hai
 What are the disorders of the soul, how should the disorder be free
 aatma swayam nirankaar kii ansh he
 Gets knowledge of nirankara by making it known
 sikhmat carmik falsafe main yakeen nahin rakhata
 Other religions say that God likes good deeds and God does very bad things with those who are bad
 lekin sikh dharm ke anusaar insaan khud kuch kar hi nahin saktaa
 a human being is limited to thinking only, that is what is in the "order", whether it is donating to a poor person or if he is killing someone
 yahi baat shri gurugranth sahib ji ke shuru main hi drudh karvaa di thi : That is why sin is not accepted in Gurmat
 agar insaan koi kriya karata he to wo antar aatma ke saath awaz mila kar kare
 It is Karna that Gurmat is against Karma scandal
 shri guru nanak dev ji ne apane samay ke bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt kuprathaon, andhvishwaason, jarjar roodhiyon or pakhandon ko dur karte hue jan-saadhaaran ko dharm ke thekedaaron, pandon, piron aadi ke changul se mukt karne kii koshish kii
 It is mandatory for the following four 'substances' to be received by humans in their lifetime: dharm, arth, kaam, moksh ko chaar padaarthon main nahin liya gaya
 Mr
 Guru Gobind Singh Ji says: sikhamat main bhakton evam satguron ne nirankaar ko akar rahit kaha he
 Because earthly substances are finished one day but Parabrahma never dies
 isi liye use akaal kaha gaya he
 Not only this, the living soul is also devoid of form and is tied with this body for some time
 iskaa vajood sharir ke bagaiyr bhi he, jo aam manushya kii budhi se dur he
 It is Karna that Sikhism is strongly against idol worship
 satguruon evam bhakton ne murti pujakon ko andha, jaanavar itiyadi shabdon se niwaja he
 His picture cannot be made
 yahi nahin koi bhi sansari padaarth jaise kii kabar, bhakton evam satguruon ke itihaasak padaarth, pratimaayein adik ko poojana sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf he
 Knowledge of religious texts is a method that leads to the country of Nirankar, before which the Sikhs bow down, but the worship of religious texts is also against the basic principles of Sikhs
 sikhamat main har jeev ko avatar kaha gaya he
 Every living being is part of that nirankar
 sansar main koi bhi panchi, pashu, ped, itiyadi avatar hai
 In the cunt of Manush, the creature has descended to complete his knowledge
 vyakti kii puja sikh dharm main nahin he "maanukh ki tech birthi sab jaanat, dene, ko eke bhagwaan"
 All avatars do not come full on the condition of a nirankar
 yahi kaaran he kii sikh kisi ko paramatior ke rup main nahin maanate
 Yes, if an avatar preaches Gurmat then Sikhs are definitely associated with that sermon
 jaisaa kii krishna ne gita main kaha he kii aatma marati nahin or jeev hatya kuch nahin hoti, is baat se to sikhamat sahamat he lekin aage krishna ne kaha he kii karm hi dharm he jis se sikh dharm sahamat nahin
 Prophet is one who spread the message or knowledge of Nirankar in the common folk
 jaisaa kii islam main kaha he kii mohammad aakhri paigambar he sikhon main kaha gaya he ki "har jug jug bhakt upaaya"
 Devotees are born equal and spread the message of Nirankar to the people
 sikhamat "laa elaha ill allaah " se sahamat he lekin sirf mohammad hi rasul allaah he is baat se sahamat nahin
 Arjun Dev ji says "dhur ki bani aayi, tein sagli chinta mittai", meaning that i have uttered a voice and my real worries have disappeared that i have found it in whose eyes i was sitting
 mul rup main bhakton avam satguruon kii vaani kaa sangreh jo satguru arjuna dev ji ne kiya tha jise aadi granth kaha jaataa he sikhon ke dharmik granth ke rup main prasiddh he | yah granth 36 bhakton kaa sachaa upadesh he or ascharyajanak baat ye he kii 36 bhakton ne nirankaar ko sam drushti main vyaakhyaan kiya he | kisi shabd main koi bhinnata nahin he | sikh aadi granth ke saath saath dasam granth, jo kii satguru gobind singh ji kii vaani kaa sangreh he ko bhi maanate hai | yah granth khalse ke adheen he | par mul rup main aadi granth kaa gyaan lenaa hi sikhon ke liye sarvopriya he | Not only this, the Sikhs respect every scripture in which Gurmat is preached
 aadi granth yaa aadi guru granth yaa guru granth sahib yaa aadi guru darbar yaa pothee sahib, guru arjuna dev dawaara sangrihith ek dharmik granth he jisame 36 bhakton ke atmik jivan ke anubhav darj hai | aadi granth is liye kaha jaataa he kyonki isamen "aadi" kaa gyaan bharpoor he | jap bani ke mutabik "sach" hi aadi he | iskaa gyaan karwaane vaale granth ko aadi granth kehete hai | iske hawaale swayam aadi granth ke bheetar hai | halaaki vidwan tabaka kahata he kyonki ye granth main guru teg bahadur ji kii bani nahin thi is liye yah aadi granth he or satguru gobind singh ji ne 9wein mahale kii bani chadhaai is liye is aadi granth kii jaganh guru granth kaha jane laga | Satguru Arjun Dev ji was present in the form of speech books of devotees and Satgurus
 Bhai Gurdas Ji wrote this book and Satguru Arjun Dev became the guide
 He also recorded his speech in the book
 Many copies of this book were also prepared
 aadi granth ke 1430 panne khalsa dawaara maanakit kiye gaye | The Dasam Granth is a Sikh scripture which is a collection of the sacred words and compositions of Satgur Gobind Singh Ji
 guru gobind singh ji ne apane jeevankaal main anek rachanaayen kii jinaki choti choti pothiyaan bana deen
 After his death, on the orders of his religious wife Mata Sundari, Bhai Mani Singh Khalsa and other Khalsa brothers collected all the works of Guru Gobind Singh ji and put it in a book which is today called "dasam Granth"
 sidhe shabdon main kaha jaye to guru gobind singh ji ne rachana kii or khalse ne sampadanaa kii
 The entire Sikh community is entertained by the Dasam Granth
 dasam granth kii vaaniyaan jaise kii jaap sahib, tav parasaad savaiye or chopai sahib sikhon ke rojaanaa sajadaa, nitnem, kaa hissaa he or yah vaaniyaan khande bate kii pahole, jis ko aam bhashaa main amrit chakna kehete hai, ko banaate vakt padhi jaati hai
 In the gurudwaras of Takhat Hazur Sahib, Takhat Patna Sahib and Nihang Singh, the Dasam Granth is lighted with Guru Granth Sahib and is also taken daily
 sarbloh granth ore bhai gurdas kii vaaren shankaa grast rachanaae hai | halaaki khalsa mahima sarbloh granth main susajit he jo satguru gobind singh kii pramanit rachana he, baaki srbloh granth main karm cond, vyakti puja itiyadi vishe mojood hai jo sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf hai | bhai gurdas kii vaaron main murti puja, karm sidhaant adik gurmat viruddh shabd darj hai No historical source is considered complete for the history of Sikhism
 Sri Guru Sobha has assumed such a book which has been written by a Sikh near Gobind Singh but dates are not given in it
 There are other historical texts of Sikhs such as Shri Guru Pratap Suraj Granth, Gurbilas Patshahi 10, Shri Gur Sobha, Manhima Prakash and Panth Prakash, Janamsakhiya Itiyadi
 Sri Guru Pratap Suraj Granth is explained in Gurdwaras
 Once Gurbilas Patshahi was 10
 Most of the history has been written after 1750
 The scholars who wrote history were mostly Sanatani, due to which, in some historical books, Satguru and devotees have shown miraculous, which according to Gurmat philosophy is not right
 Guru Nanak flying in the air, riding a crocodile, Baba Budha's oblation of Mata Ganga is embodied in the historical events of Jamsakhis and Gurbilas and later historians have written these things by putting a spice on them
 No Satgur and devotee wrote their world history
 Satguru Gobind Singh has also written as much as he has written briefly and bluntly
 Sikhism does not give much importance to history, which is useful for understanding Sikhism as much as it is useful for Sikhism
 aaj sikh itihaas kaa shuddhikaran karne main lage hai

 Vedic astrology originally mentions 27 constellations
 nakshatron ke gananaa kram main mrigashira nakshatra kaa sthaan paanchvaan he
 The effect of Mars on this constellation is because Mars is the lord of this constellation
 jaisaa ki ham aap jaanate hai vyakti jis nakshatra main janm letaa he uske swabhaav par us nakshatra vishesh kaa prabhaav rahata he
 Due to the formation of personality due to the influence of a particular constellation, astrologers tell many things about a person on the basis of the constellation present at birth in the horoscope

 At the same time, many ordinary people are investigating the origins and limitations of capabilities

 In the beginning of Villain, Zailer is shown regaining his lost strength, which was the final scene of the conclusion of Generations
 Tim Kring says that the new version will bring an army of villains to the show, hence its title
 Part three begins with the assassination attempt and its consequences on Nathan Petrelli
 In addition, many villains escape from level 5 confinement and the company attempts to capture them
 Arthur Petrelli survives systemic nerve damage with the help of Adam Monroe's medical ability and eventually recruits some new villains and later implicates Mohinder Suresh, Nathan Petrelli, Tracy Strauss, Eli Bishop, and Xiler

 Kring originally designed the series to have an ever-changing role
 However, his plan changed when he found out that the original cast was highly popular in the audience, so for the second season, he took on most of the first season's cast, along with a few additional actors who had received star ratings
 In its first season, the show went on to become the third-largest cast in American primetime television, behind Desperate Housewives and Lost, by featuring 12 main actors simultaneously
 Although the cast page of the first season of NBC listed only ten characters, Leonard Roberts, who first appeared in the series' fifth episode, was an additional member joining the original full-time cast
 In the eleventh episode of the first season, Jack Coleman was promoted from a recurring role to a twelfth full-time member

 During the first two seasons, some characters were removed to take on new characters with new stories
 Simone was the first major character to be dropped out of death at the end of season one
 DL became a guest star after the events of the first season finale, appearing only twice in season two
 Isaac Mendez was also left out of the story following his death at the hands of Xiler, who was featured in Heroes Nakamura's New York time travel campaign in season one
 Among the newly inducted characters during season two, the character Maya Herrera, played by Dania Ramirez, is a fugitive with deadly virus emissions; Adam Monroe, played by David Anders, a 400-year-old Englishman and legendary warrior Takejo Kensi with the ability to revive; Monica Dawson, a restaurant worker with the ability to mimic any physical activity, was portrayed by Dana Davis, and an anti-social behaviorist Ellie Bishop, played by Kirsten Bell, with the ability to generate electricity
 The recurring cast from season one, Zailer played by Zakari Kuinto and Ando Masahashi played by James Kyson Lee were promoted as the main characters in season two

 Heroes developed in early 2006, when Tim Kring, creator of nbc's Crossing Jordan, introduced the concept to the program
 Kring wanted to create a "big ensemble saga" that could connect with audiences
 He started thinking about how big, scary and complex the world is and he wanted to create a series focused on characters that could do something about it
 Kring realized that there were not so many big characters in a police officer or medical drama who could save the world
 He considered superheroes, ordinary people who discover extraordinary abilities while living in the real world and reality
 Casting directors Jason La Padura and Natalie Hart meet some ventures such as Milo Ventimiglia, who in the first episode "introduced the common man as a character drama with increasing reality
" a reality that was brought to light through the work of production designer Ruth Ammon

 The episode has a different structure: after a brief recap of relevant events, each show begins with a puzzle, sometimes beginning with the scene that was introduced in the previous week's episode
 Mostly Mohinder Suresh talks about the title or event in a philosophical voice
 At a dramatic turn, the screen cuts to the graphic title, which shows that the Earth is turning into a solar eclipse, with the Belly Bead performance showing the Heroes logo and the musical pause written by Kring himself
 The title of the episode is usually shown after the title scene, which is followed by a commercial break
 After the first commercial break, the title of the episode usually appears on an earthly object within the scene
 The title is presented as a chapter, each chapter having a number, which connects it to the episode number of that part
 The list of initial names usually appears in alphabetical sequences of the preceding name
 Many characters' stories are shown throughout the episode
 Sometimes these stories are lonely incidents, while sometimes the stories of other characters come in and move forward
 At this point, Suresh provides the final voiceover and most of the episodes end with an interesting twist or suspense, which is shown just before the smash cut with the "continue to" graphic
 jab lekhan team ek episod par kaam karti he, prayek lekhak ek charitra letaa he or uske irdagird ke akele drishy likhata he

 The second season saw a WGA writer strike, meaning that only 11 of the planned 24 episodes would be produced
 This forced the producers to redesign the season by incorporating only Generations out of the three episodes planned according to the predetermined plan
 The third planned part, Exodus, which originally reflected the effects of 138 variants of the peace virus in the story, was canceled
 The fourth planned part, Villain, was replaced in the third part and moved to season three
 The closing scenes of part two of "powerless" had to be re-filmed due to the cancellation of Exodus, and all the ends had to be tied to the loose ends of Generations

" Tim Molloy of TV Guide stated that Heroes will return to their origins from the fourth part
 The fugitive is an attempt to attract new viewers and bring back viewers who left the show due to excessive characters and storylines

 Music from the first season is composed by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman with music engineer Michael Perfitt and vocals by Shankar
 Each episode has an average of thirty to thirty five minutes of music
 Melvoin and Coleman were added to Heroes because of their previous work with executive producer Alan Arkush
 Tim Kring gave the pair general instructions including the emotion and direction of each character
 Kring wanted incredibly unusual music and therefore gave Wendy and Lisa the freedom and permission to experiment
 In the pilot episode, Kring suggested that a "fictional" cue be used in a scene in a burning car, played by Claire Bennett
 The "fictional" cue has since become an identity mark of the show

 On May 14, 2007, NBC announced that during the 2007–2008 season, the network would broadcast Heroes Origins, a sequel to the six-episode Heroes
 Each week a new character was to be introduced in the show and the audience had to choose who would be in the regular series of the next season
 The reason for airing this episode was stated to be a mid-season hiatus, due to which the ratings of Heroes faltered when they returned in the first season
 NBC President Kevin Raley told reporters on 14 May 2007, "we have something that i call a" big challenge "for the next year, which is trying to make our schedule more consistent for viewers
 We asked Tim Kring to tell us a plan and what i liked best is that not only do we have 30 hours of content for the next season but it will be a completely new suggestion that i think will show the show Will take you to the next level

 Criticism or critique is the literary mode of discussing an object / subject, keeping its goal in view, its merits and demerits and suitability
 hindi aalochana kii shuruyaat 19veen sadi ke uttarardh main bharatendu yug se hi maani jaati he
 'criticism' literally means 'to look well'
 'aalochana' shabd 'luch' dhaatu se bana he
 'luch' means 'to see'
 samiksha or samalochna shabdon kaa bhi yahi arth he
 'criticism' is treated as a synonym for the term 'criticism' in English
 sanskrit main prachlit 'tikaa-vyakhya' or 'kavy-siddhantanirupan' ke liye bhi aalochana shabd kaa prayog kar liya jaataa he kintu acharya ramachandra shukla kaa spasht mat he ki aadhunik aalochana, sanskrit ke kavy-siddhantanirupan se swatantra chiz he
 The task of criticism is to examine a literary work thoroughly and determine its form, population and economy
 doctor shyamsundar das ne aalochana kii paribhaasha in shabdon main di he: That is, the duty of criticism is a literary interpretation of a literary work
 sahityakar jivan or anbhuv ke jin tatwon ke sanshleshan se sahitya rachana karata he, aalochana unheen tatwon kaa vishleshan karti he
 Where literature is dominant in literature, there is an element of wisdom in criticism
 aalochana aitihaasik, saamaajik, raajnneetik paristhitiyon or shistayon kaa bhi akalan karti he or sahitya par unke padane vaale prabhaavon kii vivechna karti he
 Condemning or criticizing a work based on personal interest is not a religion of criticism
 kriti kii vyakhya or vishleshan ke liye aalochana main paddati or pranali kaa mahatva hota he
 While criticizing, the critic can avoid his personal rage, disinterest, disinterest, only when he follows the method, he can only do justice to literature by being objective
 is drushti se hindi main acharya ramachandra shukla ko sarvshereshth aalochak mana jaataa he
 The types of criticism develop according to the beliefs and practices that are accepted when criticizing
 saamanyat: samiksha ke chaar prakaaron ko sweekaar kiya gaya he:- Theories of literature are considered in theoretical criticism
 isamen pracheen shastreey kaavyagon - ras, alankaar aadi or sahitya kii aadhunik manyataon tathaa niyamon kii mukhya rup se vivchena kii jaati he
 In theoretical criticism the point of consideration is whether the criterion of literature is classical or historical
 maandand kaa shastreey rup, sthir or aparivartansheel hota he kintu mandandon ko aitihaasik shrenee maananaper unka swaroop parivartansheel or vikasaatmak hota he
 Both types of theoretical criticisms are available
 kintu ab usee saiddhanthik aalochana kaa mahatva adhik he jo sahitya ke tatwon or niyamon kii aitihaasik prakriya main vikasman maanati he
 When literature is decided on the basis of certain principles, it is called judgmental criticism
 ise ek prakaar kii naitik aalochana bhi mana jaataa he
 Its main nature is to pass judgment on literary works like a judge
 aisi aalochana praaia: hi siddhanth kaa yantric dhang se upyog karti he
 Therefore, the importance of decisive criticism decreases
 yadhyapi mulya yaa shreshth sahitya or nikrusht sahitya kaa bodh paidaa karnaa aalochana ke pradhan dharmon main se ek he lekin vah siddhanton ke yantric upyog se nahin sabhanv he
 In the 'hindi Sahitya Kosh', the subject of decisive criticism is told: is prakaar aalochana main nirnay vivaad kaa bindu utana nahin he jitna nirnay ke liye apanaaya gaya tarika
 Like, there is value judgment in Ramchandra Shukla's criticism, but his method is creative, not mechanical
 nirnayaatmak aalochana main mulya or tarika, donon kii main lacheelaapan nahin hota
 In this critique, the effect of poetry on critic Cayman makes him busy with the stylish designation
 isamen vayactik ruchi hi mukhya he
 Effective Criticism is not an object of shock
 na gyaan ke kshetra main uskaa mulya he na bhav ke kshetra main

 yadi do yaa do se adhik chaalkon ko ek vidyutrodhi madhyam dwaara alag karke sameep rakhaa jaae, to yah vyavastha sandharitra kehalaati he
 These drivers have equal and opposite charges
 yadi sandharitra ko ek bydaree se joda jaae, to isamen se dhara kaa pravaah nahin hoga, parantu isaki platon par baraabar maatra main ghanaatmak evam rinatmak aavesh sanchay ho jaayenge
 Electrical capacitors are used to store electric charge, or static electrical energy, and in electrical filters, snubbers, etc
 sandharitra main dhaatu kii do platen hotin hai jinke bich ke sthaan main koi kuchaalak dielectric padaarth bharaa hota he
 The current flows between the capacitor plates only when the voltage between its two plates changes over time
 is kaaran niyat disi vibhavaantar lagane par sthaayee avasthaa main sandharitra main koi dhara nahin bahati
 But by applying alternating capacitance between the two ends of the capacitor, the accumulated charge on its plates keeps decreasing or increasing due to which current flows in the outer circuit
 sandharitra se hokar disi dhara nahi bah sakati
 The relationship between the capacitor current and its plates is given by the following equation: jahaan : The work that has to be done in charging the capacitor is stored in the capacitor
 sandharitra main sangrahit yah urja vidyut kshetra ke rup main hoti he
 The value of stored energy u is expressed by the following formula- vaidyut kshetra ke kisi bindu par ikai aaytan main sangrahit urja kaa maan nimnlikhit sutara se diya ja saktaa he- Just as resistors and inductances are added in series or parallel order as required, proper values and proper ratings are obtained, similarly two or more capacitors are also connected as needed
 shreneekram main jude hue n sandharitron kaa tulya dharita nimnlikhit sutara se di jaati he: If two capacitors are connected in series, their equivalent capacitance can be extracted from the following simple formula- or agar dono sandharitra samaan maan vaale hon to shreneekram main sanyojit karne par unki tulya dharita prayek kii dharita kii aadhi ho jaati he
 For example, adding two capacitors of 10 microfarad in series, the equivalent capacitance would be 5 microfarad
 samaantar kram main jude sandharitron kii kul dharita unki dharitaaon ke yoga ke baraabar hoti he
 For example, if 4 capacitors with 10 microfarad are added in parallel, their total capacitance will be 40 microfarad
 sandharitra kii do platon kaa sangyojan tarah-tarah se kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus capacitors are also of many types
 teen mukhya jyamiti vaale sandharitron ke bare main neeche kii sarini main mukhya jaankariyaan di gayin hai
 One of the main properties of the conductor between the two conductors of the capacitor is its permittivity, denoted by ε
 nirvaat kii parmitivity ko ε0 se nirupit kiya jaataa he
 Its value is: 1
aavesh kaa sanchay karne main-sandharitra kaa ek mukhya upyog aavesh kar sanchay karne main kiya jaataa he
 2
 The energy stored between the charged capacitors is there to store energy
