 Optical lithography is many times faster than this, as it works parallel to the surface
 Despite the high resolution of electron-beam lithography, the generation of defects during electron-beam lithography is often not considered by users
 Defects may be classified into two categories: data-related defects, and physical defects
 Data-related defects may be classified further into two sub-categories
 Blanking or deflection errors occur when the electron beam is not deflected properly when it is supposed to, while shaping errors occur in variable-shaped beam systems when the wrong shape is projected onto the sample
 These errors can originate either from the electron optical control hardware or the input data that was taped out
 As might be expected, larger data files are more susceptible to data-related defects
 Physical defects are more varied, and can include sample charging, backscattering calculation errors, dose errors, fogging, outgassing, contamination, beam drift and particles
 Since the write time for electron beam lithography can easily exceed a day, "randomly occurring" defects are more likely to occur
 Here again, larger data files can present more opportunities for defects
 The primary electrons in the incident beam lose energy upon entering a material through inelastic scattering or collisions with other electrons
 In such a collision the momentum transfer from the incident electron to an atomic electron can be expressed as dp = 2 e 2 / bv { \ displaystyle dp = 2e ^ {2} / bv}, where b { \ displaystyle b} is the distance of closest approach between the electrons, and v { \ displaystyle v} is the incident electron velocity
 The energy transferred by the collision is given by t = 2 / 2 m = e 4 / e b 2 { \ displaystyle t = ^ {2} / 2m = e ^ {4} / Eb ^ {2}}, where m { \ displaystyle m} is the electron mass and e { \ displaystyle E} is the incident electron energy, given by e = mv 2 { \ displaystyle e = mv ^ {2}}
 By integrating over all values of t { \ displaystyle T} between the lowest binding energy, e o, { \ displaystyle Eo,} and the incident energy, one obtains the result that the total cross section for collision is inversely proportional to the incident energy e { \ displaystyle E}, and proportional to 1 / e o - 1 / e { \ displaystyle 1 / Eo-1 / E}
 Generally, e >> e o { \ displaystyle e >> Eo}, so the result is essentially inversely proportional to the binding energy
 By using the same integration approach, but over the range 2 e o { \ displaystyle 2eo} to e { \ displaystyle E}, one obtains by comparing cross-sections that half of the inelastic collisions of the incident electrons produce electrons with kinetic energy greater than e o { \ displaystyle Eo} 
 These secondary electrons are capable of breaking bonds at some distance away from the original collision
 Additionally, they can generate additional, lower energy electrons, resulting in an electron cascade
 Hence, it is important to recognize the significant contribution of secondary electrons to the spread of the energy deposition
 With todays electron optics, electron beam widths can routinely go down to a few nm
 This is limited mainly by aberrations and space charge
 However, the practical resolution limit is determined not by the beam size but by forward scattering in the photoresist and secondary electron travel in the photoresist
 The forward scattering can be decreased by using higher energy electrons or thinner photoresist, but the generation of secondary electrons is inevitable
 The travel distance of secondary electrons is not a fundamentally derived physical value, but a statistical parameter often determined from many experiments or Monte Carlo simulations down to <1 ev
 This is necessary since the energy distribution of secondary electrons peaks well below 10 ev
 Hence, The resolution limit is not usually cited as a well-fixed number as with an optical diffraction-limited system
 Repeatability and control at the practical resolution limit often require considerations not related to image formation, eg, photoresist development and intermolecular forces
 In addition to secondary electrons, primary electrons from the incident beam with sufficient energy to penetrate the photoresist can be multiply scattered over large distances from underlying films and / or the substrate
 This leads to exposure of areas at a significant distance from the desired exposure location
 These electrons are called backscattered electrons and have the same effect as long-range flare in optical projection systems
 a large enough dose of backscattered electrons can lead to complete removal of photoresist in the desired pattern area
 The smallest features produced by electron beam lithography have generally been isolated features, as nested features exacerbate the proximity effect, whereby electrons from exposure of an adjacent region spill over into the exposure of the currently written feature, effectively enlarging its image, and reducing its contrast , ie, difference between maximum and minimum intensity
 Hence, nested feature resolution is harder to control
 For most resists, it is difficult to go below 25 nm lines and spaces, and a limit of 20 nm lines and spaces has been found
 Proximity effects can be reduced by solving the inverse problem and calculating the exposure function e { \ displaystyle E} that leads to a dose distribution as close as possible to the desired dose d { \ displaystyle D} when convolved by the scattering distribution point spread function p s f 
 { \ displaystyle PSF
} Since electrons are charged particles, they tend to charge the substrate negatively unless they can quickly gain access to a path to ground
 For a high-energy beam incident on a silicon wafer, virtually all the electrons stop in the wafer where they can follow a path to ground
 However, for a quartz substrate such as a photomask, the embedded electrons will take a much longer time to move to ground
 Often the negative charge acquired by a substrate can be increased or even exceeded by a positive charge on the surface due to secondary electron emission into the vacuum
 The presence of a thin circulating layer above or below the resist is generally of limited use for high energy electron beams, since most electrons pass through the layer into the substrate
 The charge dissipation layer is generally useful only around or below 10 kev, The range of low-energy secondary electrons which can contribute to charging is not a fixed number but can vary from 0 to as high as 50 nm
 Hence, resist-substrate charging is not repeatable and is difficult to compensate consistently
 Positive charging is more tolerable than negative charging, because the latter can deflect the electron beam away from the desired exposure location
 To get around the secondary electron generation, it will be imperative to use low-energy electrons as the primary radiation to expose photoresist
 Ideally, these electrons should have energies on the order of not much more than several ev in order to expose the photoresist without generating any secondary electrons, since they will not have sufficient excess energy
 Such exposure has been demonstrated using a scanning tunneling microscope as the electron beam source
 The data suggest that electrons with energies as low as 12 ev can penetrate 50 nm thick polymer photoresist
 The drawback to using low energy electrons is that it is hard to prevent spreading of the electron beam in the photoresist
 Low energy electron optical systems are also hard to design for high resolution
 Another alternative in electron-beam lithography is to use extremely high electron energies to essentially "drill" or sputter the material
 This phenomenon has been observed frequently in transmission electron microscopy
 However, this is a very inefficient process, due to the inefficient transfer of momentum from the electron beam to the material
 As a result it is a slow process, requiring much longer exposure times than conventional electron beam lithography
 Also high energy beams always bring up the concern of substrate damage
 Interference lithography using electron beams is another possible path for patterning arrays with nanometer-scale periods
 a key advantage of using electrons over photons in interferometry is the much shorter wavelength for the same energy
 Despite the various intricacies and subtleties of electron beam lithography at different energies, it remains the most practical way to concentrate the most energy into the smallest area

 On the basis of this belief, Bell, with the help of his assistant Tomas Watson, started an effort to invent the telephone method and finally on March 10, 1876, he was able to make such an instrument that he sent a message to Watson
 Sent - Mr
 Watson, come here
 mujhe tumhaari aavashyaktaa he
 Around the same time, some other people in the United States were experimenting with the transmission of eloquence by Vidyudhi and Prof
 a scientist named Elisha Gray applied only to patent one of his instruments, just three hours after Bell was granted an application to patent his instrument

 Great Britain at first showed no enthusiasm in its country for the introduction of a telephone communication system due to the aforesaid fears, but based on the decision of the British Courts in 1880, it was considered a part of the Department of Posts

 Consequently, the National Telephone Company suffered a major loss and was eventually forced to transfer its entire telephone system and its ownership to the postal division on 1 January 1912 by an agreement
