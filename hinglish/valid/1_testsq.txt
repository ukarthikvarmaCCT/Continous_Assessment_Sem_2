 In people with emphysema, the tissues that support the body and the ability of the lungs to function are lost
 ise rogon ko ek aise samooh main shaamil kiya gaya he jise bahut dinon tak rahane vaali pratirodhi phuffusiya rog yaa COPD kehete hai 
 vatasfiti fefdon kii ek pratirodhi beemaari ko kaha jaataa he kyonki kripika naamak chote vayumargon ke aasapaas ke fefde ke utak kaa vinaash in vaayu margon ko saans chhodte samay apane kaaryaatmak aakaar ko banaae rakhane main aksham bana detaa he
 The word means - swelling and it comes from the Greek word amhayasan which means - to fill the air, it is made up of the word En which means in and physa which means breathing, airway
 vatasfiti saamanytah chronic bronchitis se sambandhit he
 Since cases of "pure" chronic bronchitis or emphysema are difficult to understand, they are commonly thought of as long-lasting obstructive pulmonary disease
 vatasfiti ko praathmik or gaun rang main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 However, most of it is classified by location
 vatasfiti ko panasinary tathaa centroasinary or centreasiner, yaa centrilobular or panelobular ke rup main upavibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 Other types include irregular and distal brackets
 yah ek vishesh prakaar janmajaat lober vatasfiti he
 CLE results in excessive enlargement of the pulmonary lobe and consequent pressure in the remaining lobes of the ipsilateral lung, and possibly also the contralateral lung
 kamjor yaa anupasthit bronkiyal upasthi kii vajah se bronkiyal kamajori paidaa hoti he
 Congenital unnecessary compression may occur, usually by an abnormally large pulmonary artery
 iske kaaran bronkiyal upasthi naram evam lunj-punj hokar vikrut ho jaati he
 CLE is strongly catastrophic, yet poses a potential life threat due to difficulty in breathing
 vatasfiti kripika ko poshit karne vaali sanrachana ke nasht hone ke kaaran honevaala fefde ke utak kaa rog he, kuch maamalon main alpha 1-antitrepsin ke kaary kii kami ke kaaran bhi yah ho jaataa he
 This causes force to push on the respiratory tract while breathing, as the narrowing of the air sac is reduced
 parinamswaroop hawa kaa bahaav avaruddha ho jaataa he or hawa fefde ke andar funs jaati he, usee tarah jis tarah ki anya pratirodhi fefde ke rogon main hota he
 Symptoms include shortness of breath and flatulence while working hard
 haalanki, hawa ke avaagaman main sankeernata hameshaa turant mrityukaarak nahin hoti or ilaaj bhi uplabdh he
 Most people with emphysema are smokers
 vatasfiti ke kaaran hua nuksaan sthaayee hota he bhale hi aadmi dhumrapaan chhod de
 is rog se grast logon ko paryaapt oxigen nahin miltaa he or ve carbon dioxide kaa unmoolan nahin kar pate, isliye ve hameshaa saans kii kami mahasoos karte hai
 Cigarette smoking is the primary cause of emphysema
 kuch maamalon main yah alpha 1-antitripsin kii kami ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Liver cirrhosis also develops due to a severe case of A1AD, where aggregated alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiencies guide the fibrotic response
 saamaanya saans lene main hawa brankai se hokar andar kripika main jaati he, jo keshika se ghiri hui chote aakaar kii theliyaan hoti hai
 Kripa absorbs oxygen and later transfers it to the bloodstream
 jab cigarette ke dhuen jaisi vishakt chijen saans lete samay fefde main jaati he to uske nuksaandaayak kan vahaan uttejk pratikriya hone ke kaaran kripika main funs jate hai
 The release of chemicals during this stimulatory reaction eventually disintegrates the alveolar membrane
 yah avasthaa jise ham jhilliy bhang ke rup main jaanate hai, fefde kii sanrachana main mahatvapurn vikruti ghatit karata he
 As a result of these deformations, the gas reduces the surface of the ring used for exchange
 iske parinamswaroop transafar factor of di langs for carbon monookesid main kami aati he
 Thoracic Cag dispersal and diaphragm contractions occur to allow for reduced surface area
 samaapti hameshaa thoracic kaig or udar kii mansapeshiyon kii kriya par nirbhar karata he, visheshat: samaapti ke antim charan main
 ventilation kii kami kii vajah se carbon diaoxide ke risaav kii kshamta main ullekhneey kshati hoti he
 In more severe cases, there is also a decrease in oxygen deposition
 chunki kripika lagaataar kharaab hoti jaati he, isliye adhik hawa kramash: nasht ho rahe uske sataha kshetra kii kshatipurti nahin kar paati or sharir khun main paryaapt oxigen kii adhikta ko barkaraar rakhane main sakasham nahin ho paata
 aise sharir ke liye antim upaay sahi vahikaaon kaa vesoconstrict karnaa hota he
 This leads to pulmonary hypertension which creates pressure on the right side of the heart, this part of the heart carries oxygen-rich blood to the lungs
 adhik khun pump karne ke liye hriday kii mansapeshi gadhi ho jaati he
 In this condition, there is often dilation in the veins of the throat
 antat, chunki hriday fail hona shuru karata he, yah thodaa bada hone lagata he or khun liver main jamaa hone lagata he
 Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency deficiency are more prone to emphysema
 A1AD uttejk anzymon ko elvailar utakon ko nasht karne kii anumati detaa he
 In most A1AD patients, the development of emphysema is not as significant, but smoking and severe reduction in A1AT levels may also cause emphysema in youth
 A1AD ke kaaran hone vaale vatasfiti ko penaciner vatasfiti ke rup main janaa jaataa he, centrilobular vatasfiti ke vipareet, jo dhumrapaan ke kaaran hota he
 Panasonic emphysema usually affects the lower lung while centrilobular emphysema affects the upper lung
 sampurna vatasfiti main lagbhag 2% vatasfiti A1AD ke kaaran hota he
 A1AD with smokers is the greatest risk for emphysema
 halkaa vatasfiti aksar bahut kam samay main gambhir rup dhaaran kar letaa hai
 A1AD informs us of the pathogen of the disease, while A1AT defines the cause of some part of the disease
 pichhali sadi ke behatar adhyayanon ne mukhya rup se lukosite elastage kii kalpit bhoomika par dhyaan kendrit kiya, rog main sanyoji utak ko nasht karne main prathmik yogadan dene vaale cerin protes ko neutrophil main paaya gaya
 The result of the investigation that neutrophil elastase is the primary starting level for A1AT and A1AT is the primary inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, the two hypotheses together has been known as the "protease-antiprotease" principle, assuming that neutrophils are one of the diseases
 Is an important median
 haalanki, ekadam haal ke adhyayanon se yah sambhaavna bani he ki bahut saare protes main se ek protes, visheshkar matrix metaloprotes gaiyr vanshanugat vatasfiti ke vikaas ke liye neutrophil ke baraabar yaa usase adhik praasangik ho saktaa he
 Better research over the past few decades related to the pathogenesis of emphysema included experiments on animals, where proteases were used in trachea of different species of animals
 in jaanwaron main sanyoji utakon kaa vinaash viksit ho gaya jise protes-antiprotes siddhant ke samarthan ke rup main liya gaya
 However, it is not established simply because of the fact that these substances can destroy the connective tissue of the lungs, as no one is able to tell
 More recent experiments have focused on technologically more advanced approaches, involving the genetic manipulation of someone
 a definite development in relation to the understanding of the disease lies in the production of protease "knock-out" animals that are genetically inferior in one or more proteases
 is rog kii samaj ke sambandh main yah akalan bhi mahatvapurn he ki kya ve jaanavar is beemaari ke vikaas ke liye kam atisamvedansheel honge
 is rog kii chapet main aane vaale vyakti durbhaagya se praaia: bahut kam din bachate hai, adhik se adhik 0-3 saal
 Diagnosis of the disease is often confirmed by pulmonary function tests, although X-ray radiography may also be included
 vatasfiti ek aparivartaneey apakshayi avasthaa he
 The only way to slow the progression of this disease is to stop smoking and avoid all the risks of smoking cigarettes and lung stimulating substances
 palmonary punarvaas rogi ke jivan kii gunvattta ko anukool banane main bahut mamadgaar ho saktaa he or unhen yah bataa saktaa he ki ve sakriy rup se apni dekhbhaal kaise karen

 Emphysema can also be treated with anticholinergics, bronchodilators, steroid therapy, keeping the body in an effective state, and alternative oxygen if necessary
 rogi kii anya avasthaaon jaise, gastric reflux tathaa allergy kaa ilaaj karne se fefde ke kaary main sudhaar hota he
 The use of prescribed supplemental oxygen is the only non-surgical treatment that can provide longer life to patients with emphysema

 Lame volume reduction surgeries can improve the quality of life of some patients carefully selected
 yah alag tareekon se kiya ja saktaa he, jinamein se kuch kam invesive hai
 In July 2006, a new treatment by placing a small valve in the passageway leading to the bad lung area was reported to give good results, but 7% of the patients suffered from partial lung rupture
 vatasfiti kaa ek maatr janaa mana ilaaj fefdon kaa pratyaropan he, lekin kuch rogi hi itane majboot hote hai ki is surgery ko sah sakate hai
 During the treatment of emphysema, the combination of the age of a patient, oxygen loss and the side-effects of medicines, make the heart and kidneys and other organs useless
 sargical pratyaropan ke samay rogi ko ek anti-rijection drug regimen lene kii jarurat padati he jo sharir kii pratiraksha pranali ko dabaa detii he, tathaa rogi main microbial sankraman bhi paidaa kar sakati he
 Those patients who feel that they have fallen victim to this disease, then as soon as possible, they should pay attention to its treatment
 european rispiretary jarnal main prakashit ek adhyayan yah bataata he ki vitamin a se praapt tretinoin chuhon ke kripika main lacheelaapan laakar vatasfiti ke prabhaav ko ulat detii he
 While vitamin a consumption is not considered as an effective cure or prevention of this disease, this research can give a direction to overcome the disease in future
 uske baad 2010 main manushya kii vatasfiti ke ilaaj ke liye vitamin-a kaa prayog kar kiye gayi adhyayan kaa anishchit parinaam niklaa or yah ullekh kiya gaya ki is tarah ke ilaaj ko lekar kisi nishkarsh par pahunchane ke liye aage kaa shodh jaruri he

 Our memories are a major part of our personality
 ham kya yaad rakhte hai or kya bhul jate he yah sab bahut sari chizon par nirbhar karata he
 Memory, like language, vision, hearing, perceptiveness, learning and meditation, is also a major intellectual ability of the brain
 hamaare mastishk main jo kuch bhi anubhav, soochna or gyaan ke rup main sangrahit he vah sabhi smriti ke hi vividh roopon main vyavasthit rahata he
 The study of this ability of the human brain is a fairly broad subject matter
 mukhyatah iskaa adhyayan manovigyaan, tantrikavigyaan evam ayurvigyaan ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 In the article presented, various forms of memory, its biological basis, major memory related diseases and some major memory tips will be highlighted
 hamaari smriti kaise kaam karti he yaa phir kisi bhi cheez ko ham kaise yaad rakh pate hai? smriti hamaare mastishk main kis prakaar sangrahit hoti he? ham kisi cheez ko kyon bhul jate hai or kuch chije bhulaae nahin bhuulati
 These fundamental questions have always agitated the human mind and efforts have been made from time to time to answer them
 hamamen se sabhi ke andar puraani baton ko yaad rakhane kii kshamta hoti he
 We keep remembering a person, place, event and situations
 un se kuch sikhte hai
 Then further secure them in the form of experiences and knowledge
 hamaare aage kaa vyavhaar iske dwaara niyantrit hota he ki hamane kya siikhaa he
 Initially, memory was compared to a physical location and the information stored in it was seen as various objects kept in that location
 is upama ko samajhane ke liye ek pustkaalay kaa udhaaharan liya ja saktaa he
 The library represents a physical place, ie the entire memory and the books kept in it are like various information
 smriti kii is vyakhya ko lambey samay tak manyata bhi mili
 But later on the basis of logic doubts were raised about its authenticity
 yah dekha gaya ki smriti kii yah vyakhya praarambhik str par to sahi thi lekin yah smriti ke vibhinn prakramon jaise ki kisi puraani ghatana kaa samaran tathaa nai smritiyon ke nirmaan kii uchit vyakhya karne main asafal siddh hui
 More new theories came to understand memory
 inamen se computer vigyaan dwaara prerit siddhant sabase upyukt siddh hua
 This new interpretation of memory was presented on the basis of the neural network model
 iske anusaar smriti hamaare mastishk main ek jagah kendrit hone ke bajaae samaantar rup se vitarit hoti he
 This distribution is made up of microscopic units that are equivalent to a nerve cell
 in ikaayiyon main smriti, ek tarah ke sakriyata praturup main nirupit hoti he
 According to the modern definition, our memory is a collective process which has three main stages
 sabase pehle iske pratham charan main soochnaaon ko kutabaddh kiya jaataa he
 After this, these encrypted information is collected in the second phase and they are recalled in the last phase
 hamen apane aasapaas ke vaataavaran ko mahasoos karne ke liye pehle aavashyak he ki vaataavaraniya uddipano ko usase sambandhit gyanendriyon dwaara grahan kiya jaae
 For example, to see an object, we receive the reflected light from it through the eyes
 ab is paravartit prakaash ko netra kii retina main upasthit samvedi tantrika koshikaayen ksheen vaidyutiya tarango main badalati hai
 It can now be said that the light stimulation in the atmosphere by the retina has been electrified
 ab yah halki vaidyutiya tarang mastishk ke drishy kshetra main jaati he or yahaan isaki vyakhya kii jaati he
 Based on this interpretation, we create a reflection of the front view in our mind
 is samoochee prakriya ko drishy pratyakshikaran yaa dekhnaa kehete hai
 At the time of coding, information is mainly coded based on location, time and frequency
 soochnaaon ko code karne ke baad unke sangrahan kaa sthaan aata he
 This storage can be at the sensory level or short-term memory level or long-term memory level
 yahaan yah ullekhneey hoga ki hamaare mastishk main sangrahan ke samay soochnaaon main thodaa parivartan ho saktaa he
 Meaning that the notifications will not remain as they were in the real world
 unamem ham apane paas se kuch mila sakate he yaa phir us soochna ke kisi bhaag ko nikaal bhi sakate hai
 If there is half the incomplete information, then we can also build it on the basis of our imagination
 is gun ke kaaran smriti ek nirmaanatmak prakriya hoti he
 Additional level of memory is classified based on the collection of information in memory
 hamen kaise pataa chalata he ki hamaare paas kisi vishesh samay yaa sthaan kii smriti he? tabhi jab ham use samaran karte hai
 For example, if you ask the names of the five teachers of your childhood, whose teachings have had the greatest impact on your life, we will not be late to answer
 lekin agar yah puuchhen ki varsh 2000 se 2005 tak jaiviki yaa kisi bhi kshetra main nobel puraskaar praapt vaigyanikon ke naam bataaie to shaayad hamen kuch der tak sochna pad jaae
 It becomes clear here that what we remember and what we forget depends a lot on our motivations, conscious and unconscious desires etc
 atah samaran, sampurna smriti kaa ek aavashyak ang he
 Now the question arises that what is the mechanism of different processes of memory? In 1968, to explain the above processes of memory, Atkinson and Siffrin presented an explanation of the multi-layered collection of memory
 is paribhaasha ke anusaar smriti ke teen mukhya sangrah hote hai
 Our senses take the task of taking any information from the environment and passing it to the brain
 baad me us soochna ke aadhaar par mastishk dwaara ek nishkarsh nikaala jaataa he
 We can take the example of cold or heat sensation by seeing, hearing or skin
 koi bhi vaataavaraniya uddipan jaise prakaash yaa dhwani sabase pehle apane sambandhit gyanendriya me bahut hi kam samay ke liye kutabaddh rup main sangrahit hota he
 This storage is for a short time
 drushti ke liye isaki seemaa 0
5 second or shravan ke liye isaki samay seemaa 2 second ke aasapaas hoti he
 After this time limit, this stored memory is lost
 andrik str par suchanaaen abhi praarambhik hoti hai or inase koi nishkarsh nahin nikaal sakate
 Their brain has yet to be combined and scoured
 gyanendriyon dwaara praapt suchanaaen jab hamaare dhyaan main aati hai to ve alpakaaleen smriti kaa bhaag banati hai
 It is worth mentioning here that all the information at the sensory level which we do not pay attention to, ends
 keval vahiin suchanaaen jin par ham ekagra hote he ve alpakaaleen smritiyaan banati hai
 Short-term memory is also called functional memory
 is prakaar kii smriti kaa sarvshereshth udhaaharan hamaare dwaara koi phone number yaad karnaa he
 When we look at a number and dial it, there are two things
 sabase pehle ham nabar ko dekhte hai or use kuch ek baar doharaa ke yaad karte hai phir number dial karne ke baad saamanytah use bhul jate hai
 Hence two conclusions can be drawn regarding this type of memory
 pratham, alpakaaleen smriti kii kshamta bahut kam hoti he dwitiya, is prakaar kii smriti main agar ekaagratha main thodi bhi kami se hamaara dhyaan bant jaae to smriti shesh nahin rah jaati
 In the example of phone, if there is any other thing between remembering and dialing the number, then we will not remember the number
 vaigyanikon ne pataa lagaaya he ki is prakaar kii smriti main soochna kaa kul sangrahan 20 se 30 second tak hi hota he
 But if the information is repeated, this time can be more than 20 to 30 seconds
 or agar baar-baar dhyaan se doharaaen to yah soochna dirghakaalin smriti main parivartit ho jaati he
 As is clear from the name itself, long-term memories are permanent
 ham is smriti kaa upyog bahut tareeko se karte hai
 What did we eat for breakfast this morning? Who came to our house the day before yesterday? What clothes did those people wear? Where and how did we celebrate our last birthday? From how we ride a bicycle to solve a crossword puzzle, this memory supports us in all these activities
 is prakaar kii smriti sabase adhik vividh hoti he or hamaari bhaawanaaon, anubhavon tathaa gyaan ityadi in sabhi rupo main parilakshith hoti he
 Short-term memory information becomes a long-term memory after repeated repetitions
 is smriti kaa kshay nahin hota lekin isamen parivartan ho saktaa he
 Till now, the mechanism of memory was being talked about
 yah prashn abhi baaki he ki hamaara mastishk in soochnaaon ko kaise sangrahit karata he or tantrika tantra kii koun-koun si gatividhiyaan iske liye uttardaai hoti hai
 If memory resides in our brain, then there should be some evidence of its physical representation
 is disha main bahut saare shodh hue hai or iske sandarbh main bahut si vyakhyaayein bhi prastut kii gayi hai
 It was known from the beginning that only biological molecules are responsible for building memory
 sabase pehle 1960 ke dashak main DNA anuon ke vyutpann ke aadhaar par isaki vyakhya karne kii koshish kii gai
 It has been reported that mrna molecules are responsible for the biological representation of memory
 ullekhneey he ki ye mrna anu hamaare jini sandeshon or protein nirmaan ke liye mukhya rup se sambandhit hote hai
 In later years it was observed that this hypothesis of the physical basis of memory is not correct and new inventions are needed to present any idea in this field
 1970 ke dashak main smriti ke bhautik nirupan ke sambandh main kuch nae vichaar aae
 It has been reported that memory is generated in the brain in the form of weak electrical waves and it somehow makes permanent physical changes in the brain's structure at the microscopic level
 yah bhautik parivartan ek nai smriti ko nirupit karata he
 It would be notable for this interpretation that it was based on various experimental tests and was also correct
 lekin yahaan is baat kii vyakhya nahin ho paati thi ki “ksheen vaidyutiya tarange sanrachanaatmak rup se kaise or kya parivartan karti hai
 "in recent years, researches have yielded new information regarding Smriti Jowki
 inke anusaar smriti nirmaan main do pramukh kaarak tantrika rasayan or tantrika koshika ke synapse mukhya bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Researches have indicated that the neurotransmitters responsible for information convection in two nerve cells that are secreted by the synapses repeatedly stimulate a particular neural motif for a particular memory
 falswaroop ek pattern ban jaataa he
 Experiences and repeated attempts may change this pattern slightly
 kisi smriti vishesh ke liye yah pattern sthai hota he
 In other words, there are definite neural patterns for each of our experiences, art, skills, memory, etc
 jab ham kisi ke bare main sochate hai to usase sambandhit praaroop kaam kar rahaa hota he
 When we are solving a question, another format is activated
 ham sabhi ne kisi na kisi samay aisi sthiti kaa saamana kiya hoga jab ham apni yaadasht ko yaad karte hai
 For example, we are going to say something and suddenly forget what to say or all the answers of the question paper are coming in the exam but they are unable to find words to write
 yah smriti lop ke chote-chote udhaaharan hai
 On the other hand you may have noticed that some people complain of forgetting in old age
 ainstine ke bare main ek kahani prachlit he ki ek baar ve apane vishvavidhyalay main tahal rahe the tabhi unke ek vidhyaarthee ne unhen dopaher ke bhojan ke liye poocha
 Einstein asked him from which direction i was coming when you stopped me? The student pointed to one side and told that you were coming from that direction
 tab ainstin ne uttar diya
 Thank you! Then i have eaten food
 aisi bahut si kathaayen darshanikon or vaigyanikon ke sambandh main kahi jaati hai
 This is an example of a small-scale memory loss
 uparokt sabhi ghatnaon main ham dekhte hai ki kahin na kahin se hamaare mastishk kii sugam kriyasheeltaa main rukaawat ho rahi hoti he
 a small amount of memory defects occur in almost everyone but it cannot be named disease
 jab in lakshanon ke kaaran vyakti aurausase jude log prabhavit hone lage tabhi ise smritibhransh kaa naam dete hai
 These types of patients cannot remember the people they met only half an hour ago
 unhe yah bhi yaad nahin rahata ki das minute pehle unhone snaan kiya tha
 The normal actions of life are very badly affected
 smriti lop yaa smriti bhransh, smriti sambandhi ek aisi ghatana he jisamen isse sambandhit kisi bhi prakram jaise samaran yaa sangrahan main baadha utpann ho jaati he or jiske falswaroop hamaari saamaanya smriti prabhavit hoti he
 This obstruction can be caused by any physical or psychological cause such as brain injury or any other cause of damage, disease, nutritional deficiency, shock, excessive alcohol consumption, drug abuse and age
 yahaan smritilop ke kuch mukhya prakaaron kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Symptoms are seen in people who consume excessive alcohol
 sharaab se lambey samay tak adhik maatra main seven karne se mukhyatah do samasyaayein hoti hai
 One is thiamine vitamin deficiency at dangerous levels and second, some harmful structural changes take place in the brain
 inke falswaroop rogiyon ki smriti buree tarah se prabhavit hoti he
 It is seen that their present-day memory is fine but they are unable to remember the past events and many important memories are completely missing from their memory
 is prakaar ke smriti bhransh main nai suchanaaen yaad karne main kathinaayee hoti he, lekin beeti ghatnaon kii smritiyaan bilkul thik hoti hai
 Such instances are seen that someone has been hurt on a particular part of the brain and after that only he can remember the old things and there is no space left for any new memory after the accident
 iske lakshanon main puraani ghatnaayen to ascharyajanak rup se bhul jaati hai lekin nai ghatnaon se sambandhit smritiyon main koi pareshaani nahin hoti
 Such instances are seen that after an accident, all the old memories are not known where? But there is no difficulty in remembering new information
 is prakaar ke smritilop main smriti kuch dinon main waapas aa jaati he
 It has been observed that sometimes our mind also inspires us to forget some special memories
 or ham unhen puri tarah se bhul bhi jate hai
 Such arrangements have been made by nature to make our present enjoyable
 aisa vishesh taur par bahut hi peedaadaayak smritiyon ke sandarbh main hota he
 For example, a tragic incident in childhood, punishment etc
 yahaan ullekhneey hoga ki ye smritiyaan keval hamaare chetan man se lupt hoti hai
 Somewhere in the deep unconscious, their parts are present
 ham apane aas-paas aise anek logon ko dekhte hai jinaki smriti kshamta bahut acchhee hoti he
 There are some people who are known for their forgetful nature
 ham main se sabhi sochate hai ki hamaari yaadasht kshamta batch jaae to kitna acha ho
 The main symptom of a good memory is that it arranges all related things in order and ensures their availability immediately when needed
 kuch aisi davaaiyaan uplabdh hai jinase gambhir rup se bhuulane kii sthiti main sahaayta milti he
 But these medicines should be used only in special conditions
 ham kitni acchhee tarah se yaad karte or sikhte hai yah kaaphi kuch hamaare bhaavnaatmak sthiti par nirbhar karata he
 An inspiring environment for learning and understanding is always beneficial
 ham tab bhi behatar tareeke se sikh pate hai jab ham dhyaan dete hai
 It is also necessary how the information is being coded
 iskaa bhandaaran or samekan kis prakaar ho rahaa he or iskaa punah samaran kaise ho rahaa he
 a good memory requires all these actions to go smoothly
 smriti yuktiyaan aisi vyavhaarik vidhiyaan hai jinase smriti kshamta ek had tak badhaai ja sakati he
 We also use them to remember some things unknowingly
 nepolian ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki use apni sena ke prayek adhikari kaa naam yaad tha
 People with such unique memory abilities appear to remember almanacs for many years
 ab yah prashn uthta he ki ek saamaanya vyakti ke yaad karne ke tareeke or vishisht smriti sampann logon ke tareekon main kya antar hota he? shodhon dwaara dekha gaya he ki alag-alag vyaktiyon main soochnaaon ke kodikaran, sangrahan or samaran kaa tarika thodaa alag ho saktaa he
 a good memory can either be an innate talent or can be learned later by ordinary people using some special methods
 janmajaat rup se ucch smriti kshamta vaale vyaktiyon main smritiyon kii prakriya thodi jatil hoti he
 It has been observed that some people also have symptoms of synesthesia
 sinesthesia ko samajhane ke liye kaha ja saktaa he ki aise log dhwani ko sunne ke saath saath dekhte or drishyon ko dekhne ke saath sunate bhi hai
 So they can use the visual capacity of the brain as well as the hearing capacity to see something
 udhaaharan ke liye ek komal madhur dhwani unke liye ek sundar rangon kaa samooh bhi ho saktaa he or ek kathor dhwani ke liye gahare tej chubte hue rang bhi ho sakate hai
 Symptoms of synesthesia may also occur for other sensory abilities such as touch, olfaction, etc
 smriti ko prabhaavshaalee banane ke liye anya bhi bahut sari smriti yuktiyaan prayog kii jaati hai
 Such as recalling already stored memory by adding new information, remembering the same information by putting it together, turning any information into an interesting story, etc
 jatil paathya saamagree ko samajhane ke liye ek or vidhi SQ3R bahut hi upyogi hoti he
 In this, we first prepare a blueprint of the textual content in mind, then make some questions based on "what, why and how" by itself
 ab in prashnon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue paathya saamagree ko dhyaan purvak padhaa jaataa he or phir use kram se dubaara padhate hai
 Finally it is reviewed by the reader
 acchhee smriti ke liye acha maansik or shaareerik swasthya jaruri he
 Along with this, emotional attachment to what is being read is also necessary
 kuch ekaagratha badhaane vaali vidhiyaan jaise ki dhyaan or pranayam aadi bhi smriti kii kshamta badhaane main bahut upyogi siddh hui hai
 Dimensions of Memory, Scientific, April – September 2008, pages 16–20

 kintu ise stem koshika ke dwaara praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 It has also been observed that osteoblasts can be converted into nerve cells
 tantrika koshika shabd kaa pehali baar prayog german sharir vigyaanshastri henrik vilhelm woldere ne kiya tha
 Nerve cells first came to light in the 20th century when Santigio Ramon Cajal reported that it was the primary functional unit of the nervous system
 kejal ne prastaav diya tha ki tantrika koshika alag koshikaayen hoti hai jo ki vishisht jankshan ke dwaara ek duusare se sanchaar karti he
 Kejal used the silver staining method created by Camilo Golgi to study the structure of nerve cells
 mastishk main tantrika koshika kii sankhya prajatiyon ke aadhaar par alag hoti he
 According to an estimate, there are 100 billion nerve cells in the human brain
 toronto vishvavidhyalay main hue anusandhan main ek aise probhujin kii pahchaan hui he jisaki mastishk main tantrikaon ke vikaas main mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he
 With the help of this probujin, it will also be easier to understand the functioning of the brain and the causes of diseases like Alzamers can also be discovered
