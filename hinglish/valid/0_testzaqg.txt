 The functions and services of the bank can be divided into four categories: raashi jamaa karne main bank praaia: teen prakaar ke lekhe kholte hai : chal lekhe, sthir lekhe, bachat lekhe
 Bank deposits have to be paid at any time on the demand of the depositor
 at: ise bank kii 'maang dendaree' bhi kehete hai
 Fixed accounts are credited for a fixed period which cannot be withdrawn before the expiry of the period
 yadi koi jamakarta sthir lekhe main jamaa apni raashi ko avadhi purna hone se purv nikaalnaa chaahe to use raashi par byaaj nahin miltaa
 This type of deposit is called 'call liability'
 tisare prakaar kii jamaa bachat lekhe main kii jaati he
 No amount can be deposited beyond the limit prescribed in Savings Account is prakaar ke lekhe kam ywaale logon kii bachat ko protsaahan dene ke liye khole jate hai
 Sometimes special types of accounts are also opened for special works
 udaahranarth, vivaah ke liye dhanrashi sangrah ke hetu vivaah lekha, shiksha ke liye raashi sangrah karne ke hetu shiksha lekha aadi
 Loans and advances are given by the bank in several forms: bank apane graahakon or anya vishwasaneey vyaktiyon tathaa sansthaaon ko keval vyavsaay evam utpaadan sambandhi kaaryon ke liye rin dete hai
 While giving loan, banks open an article in the name of the borrower and deposit the loan amount in it, due to which the borrower keeps writing the amount from time to time by writing the check as per the requirement
 isse bank ko sakal rinrashi ek saath hi rinayachak ko de dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti jisase bank kaa hanibhay kam ho jaataa he
 Loans are sanctioned against personal credit and security of goods
 adhivikarsh dwaara rin dene se bank apane jamakarta ko uske chal tathaa bachat lekhon main jamaa raashi se adhik raashi nikaalane kaa adhikaar de detaa he
 But before obtaining such a right, the customer has to enter into a definite agreement with his bank on the amount of overdraft, its duration, rate of interest, etc
 bank vyavsaayik maal kii jamaanat par tathaa pranapatron or saakhapatron kii saakh par bhi rin dete hai
 Loans are given against the security of goods by keeping them in their godowns or by locking themselves in merchants' warehouses
 par is prakaar rin dene se pehle bank maal ke vaastavik mulya par chhot laga lete hai
 Loans can also be obtained from the bank through deduction of bills
 koi bhi malvikreta apane kharidaar ke naam vinimay bill likhakar usapar uski sweekruti praapt karke kisi bank se us sweekrut bill kii katautee kara letaa he
 On deducting, the bank deducts its commission and pays the balance of the bill to the bill holder and then at the end of the bill period, it gets the full amount from the acceptor of the bill
 is prakaar diya gaya rin praaia: alpakaaleen hota he
 The bank also performs agency work for its customers
 agency sambandhi kriyaayein is prakaar hai : graahakon ke liye bilon, chekon tathaa pranapatron kii raashi vasuul tathaa unki ore se chukaaye janevaale bilon, chekon tath pranapatron kaa bhugtan karnaa, kisi vyakti athwa sanstha ko niyamit rup se ek nishchit raashi bhugtana, beemaa companiyon ko pravyaji kii raashi chukaana, sarkaar kaa graahakon kii ore se iskar chukaana tathaa unki ore se malgujari chukaane kii vyavastha karnaa, company ke anshon par labhaansh tathaa rinpatron par byaaj vasuul karnaa or sarkari sicuritiyon kaa kray-vikray karnaa tathaa unke salaahkaar or pratinidhi kii haisiyat se kaam karnaa
 In banking practice, the relationship between bank and customer can often be expressed in three ways: jab bank main graahak kii raashi jamaa ho, jiskaa bhugtan bank ko graahak ke maangane par karnaa pade to bank graahak kaa dendar ore graahak bank kaa lender hota he
 But sometimes this relationship also turns the opposite
 jab graahak bank se rin le athwa apane lekhe main jamaa raashi se adhik raashi nikaale to bank graahak kaa lender or graahak uskaa dendar ban jaataa he
 In normal practice, the debtor is required to return the amount paid after the expiry of the loan, irrespective of whether the demand is from the creditor or not
 par bank ek aisa dendar hota he jo apane paas jamaa kii hui raashi ko graahak ke maangane par hi lautaata he, anyathaa nahin
 But if the customer is the debtor of the bank, then he has to pay the loan on the demand of the bank after the end of the period and not even after it is asked
 bank dwaara jamaa rup main liye hue rinon ke saath anya saamaanya rinon kii bhanti 'kaal maryaada niyam' lagu nahin hota
 The amount can remain in the customer's account for how long
 bank ek hi graahak ke vibhinn lekhon ko ekatra maanakar apana rin vasuul kar saktaa he par graahak bank main apane vibhinn lekhon ko ekatra maanakar raashi bhugtan karne ke liye bank ko vivash nahin kar saktaa
 The bank receives a title lien from the customer on the amount or securities in the normal transaction
 bank ko graahak kii un sicuritiyon par, raashi par tathaa vastuon par grahanadhikaar praapt hota he jo uske paas kisi vishisht uddeshy ke hetu na ai hon varan banking lenden ke saamaanya kram main praapt hui hon
 The bank can recover its loan if the customer does not repay the loan by selling the goods under the lien
 jis samay bank apane graahak ke aadesh se uske lekhe par sicuritiyon kaa kray vikray karata he, uske lekhe par iskar, bhoomikar, beemaa kii prakhyaji kaa, chanda aadi kii raashi kaa bhugtan karata he to us sthiti main bank graahak ke pratinidhi ke rup main kaam karata he
 As long as the customer's heritage remains with the bank, the bank is called the customer's trustee and the customer's bank's candidate
 pratyaashee ke rup main kaam karte hue bank ko apane pratyaashee ke dwaara jamaa kii hui vastuon ko badi saavdhaanee or suraksha ke saath rakhana aavashyak hota he
 Banks charge some fees from customers for this service
 bank mulat: saakh kaa lenden karte hai-saakh par janata se unki atirek bachat raashi jamaa lete or us jamaa raashi ko anya rinyaachakon ko rin rup main udhaar dete hai
 Thus, in the course of transaction of funds, banks create credit and are called creators of credit
 saakh kii srujankriya main jamaa, katautee tathaa nirgaman ye teen kaary sannihit hote hai
 When a bank approves a loan to a person or an institution, it usually does not provide the loan amount in cash at the same time, but opens and deposits the loan account of the person asking for the loan and the borrower is empowered to make the check as per his requirement
 Continue to withdraw money by writing
 is prakaar ek ore rin sweekrut kiya jaataa he to duusari ore usee rin kii raashi se jamaa bana lee jaati he
 Thus, debt gives rise to deposits
 jab bank apni jamaa raashi main se graahakon ko rin detaa he to us samay jamaa rin kii janmdatri hoti he or jab bank rin sweekrut karne main jamaa kaa nirmaan karte hai, to us samay rin jamaa ke janmdata ban jate hai
 The third method of credit creation is through banknote issuance
 par yah adhikaar keval desh ke kendriya bank ko hi mila hota he
 Each bank is independent in its credit creation policy, even if it has to keep its own credit-building capacity, the cash fund held by central banks, the fund of banks deposited with central banks, metallurgical funds deposited with banks, credit of credit petitioners and The general economic and political situation of the country has to be taken care of
 janata se dhan raashi jamaa karaane main bank do prakaar kaa daayitv apane upar letaa he- maang dendaree, kaal dendaree
 Demand dues are to be paid by the bank at any time on the statutory demand of the depositors and the term dues are usually paid at the end of the specified period
 aisi sthiti main bank apane paas jamaa kul raashi ko rin yaachakon ko udhaar nahin de saktaa kyonki use yah bhay rahata he ki na maaloom kab jamakarta maang karke apni raashi lene aa jaae
 Therefore, before lending, the bank keeps some cash in the fund with it, so that it can meet the demand of the depositors from time to time
 yah raashi bank kaa nakad kosh kehalaata he
 Some banks also keep cash funds with them and deposit them with the central bank so that they can meet the demand of the depositors by giving the amount from there
 nakad kosh bank kii saakh banaae rakhane main sahaayak hota he
 Cash fund is said to be the 'first line of defense' of the bank
 kisi bhi samay nakad kosh kii raashi nimna paristhitiyon par nirbhar hoti he : Statutory decisions, average deposits of depositors, banking habits and tendencies of the people, general nature of customers, local customs and circumstances, arrangement of Mundramandi business conditions or facilities of clearing house in the country
 ukt paristhitiyon ke atirikt nakad kosh kii maatra bank adhikariyon ke purv anubhav, unki doordarshita tathaa us desh kii vyapaarik sthiti par nirbhar hoti he

 is byaaj kii raashi main se kuch bhaag vah jamakartaon ko unki jamaa raashi par byaaj swaroop dekar shesh raashi vah apane paas bachaa letaa he
 The bank is required to carefully appropriate the remaining amount by keeping some part of its gross deposits as cash funds
 bank kii viniyog niti bhinn bhinn deshon main, bhinn bhinn avasaron par or vibhinn bainkon ke saath bhinn bhinn hoti he
 It is necessary for each bank to consider several factors while setting its investment policy
 bank kii raashi kaa viniyog is prakaar ho ki aavashyaktaa hone par use rokad raashi main badalawaaya ja sake, viniojit mooldhan surakshit rahe, viniogon se santoshjanak aay bhi mili, dhanrashi kaa viniyog kisi ek hi udyog vyapaar main na kiya jaae, bank kii raashi kisi vyaktivishesh ko hi rin ke rup main na di jaae, jamaanton kaa bhalee bhanti nirikshan kar liya jaae, jamaanat, jisapar raashi viniojit kii ja rahi he, taral, surakshit or laabhprad ho or yadi kabhi kisi jamaanat main mulya kaa hraas hone lage to rini se turant anya jamaanat lekar us hraas kaa puraa kiya ja sake
 Normally, banks appropriate their funds in two ways: by purchasing items like geodesy, furniture etc
 for conducting business
 isse bank ko koi aay nahin milti
 By giving short term loans, cutting bills and buying and selling securities
 inase bank ko aay hoti or laabh miltaa he
 To make a profit, banks appropriate their funds by giving short-term loans, purchasing and cutting bills, purchasing appropriations and other securities, or accepting loans and advances

 The collateral security may be in the form of a charter in respect of goods or goods in addition to the personal credit of the person taking the loan
 isamen saamanyat: teen adhikaar hote hai- swatv grahanadhikaar, praadhi or bandhak
 Under the lien, the bank reserves the right to retain the security held by the borrower if the borrower does not pay the loan
 bank ko is jamaanat ko bechney kaa adhikaar nahin hota or yadi vah aisa karnaa hi chaahe to use nyaayalay se tatsambandhi ajna praapt karnaa aavashyak hota he
 In the period, the ownership of the bail is transferred to the bank's name, but the debtor owns the property
 bandhak ke antargat bank ko jamaanat par grahanadhikaar karne or use uchit soochna dekar bechney kaa bhi adhikaar hota he
 The collateral security consists of commercial goods and merchandise rights, life insurance papers and securities sold on stock exchanges
 saamanyat: bank achal sampatti kii saakh par rin nahin dete
 Individual bail or guarantee can be of two types: for a specific amount, for an entire amount
 vishisht guarantee ke antargat guarantee karanevaala vyakti kisi vishisht evam nishchit raashi kii guarantee kar detaa he
 In addition to the total guarantee, the gross amount of the loan is guaranteed and its liability is for the gross amount
 guarantee likhit athwa maukhik di ja sakati he
 While taking the guarantee, it is necessary for the bank to thoroughly investigate the credit and financial condition of the person making the guarantee, so that there is no possibility of any loss in future
 bank kii safalataa adhikansh main uske prabandhakon evam sanchaalkon par nirbhar hoti he
 Banks store deposits of checks to customers for conducting checks or current accounts, and deposits of checks into current accounts of customers

 angrezi aam kanoon ke tahat, ek banker ek vyaktike rup main paribhaashit he jo banking ke vyapaar ko karata he, jo is prakaar nirdisht he Most English common law jurisdictions have an exchange act proposal that codifies the law, including negotiable instrument checks, and the act incorporates a statutory definition of the term banker: a banker is a body of individuals whether or not involved in the business of banking
 Although this definition seems circular, it is actually functional, as it ensures that checks like Legal bank transaction basis does not depend on how the bank is organized or regulated kai angrezi aam kanoon deshon main banking ke vyavsaay kaanoon dwaara paribhaashit nahin he balki saamaanya kaanoon dwaara, paribhaasha uparokt anya angrezi aam kanoon kshetradhikaar main banking ke vyapaar yaa banking kaarobaarake savindhik paribhaasha hai jab in paribhaasha ko dekhte hai to yah dhyaan dena aavashyak he kii ve banking ke vyapaar ko vidhayan ke uddeshy se paribhaashit kar rahe hai or saamaanya main aavashyak nahi vishesh rup se, adhikansh paribhaasa kanoon se he jiske paas pravesh ke prayojanon ke viniman he or bainkon kii nigaraanee karte hai vaastavik vyavsaay ke viniman sehaalanki, kai maamalon main kanoonee paribhaasha ke nikat ek saamaanya kanoon kaa darpan sanvidhik paribhaashaayen ke udhaaharan: Since the advent of EFTPOS, direct loans, direct debit and Internet banking, checks have lost their prominence as a payment tool

 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society

 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy

 Louis 16th tried to overcome the economic crisis through financial advisors like the Turks, Necker but these reform efforts could not be implemented because the privileged class did not accept the taxation on themselves

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor the abolition of the monarchy, he just exposed the faults of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy
 waltare ne apni pustakon ke letters on inglish madhyam se britain kii udaar raajnneeti, dharm or vichaar swatantraaa kaa vishad chithran kiya tathaa puraatan francisi vyavastha se uski tulana kii or france main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kamiyon kaa ullekh kiya

 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church
 waltare england ke sanvaidhanik rajtantr ke anuroop hi france main bhi vaisaa hi shashan sthapit karnaa chahta tha

 ruson ne kaha ki samuhik ichha se bane rajya kaa yah anivaary tathaa saarvbhaum kartavya he ki vah saare samaaj ko sarvopari maanate hue kaary ko sanchalit karen
 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people
 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"

 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year

 a section of thinkers was focused on the economic disorder and analysis prevailing in France at this time

 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages

 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people
 yadhyapi shashan pranali rajtantratmak bani raheen parantu raja ke adhikaron ko simit kiya gaya
 He is no longer a lawmaker
 raja ko kisi desh se yuddh yaa sandhi karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 The authority to legislate was given to an assembly and its members numbered 745
 vyavasthapika ke sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye nagarikon ko sakriy or nishkray do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya gaya or matadhikaar keval sakriy nagarikon ko diya gaya
 Active citizens were those over the age of 25 who paid the state direct tax equal to three days' income while inactive citizens were those who were poor
 rashtriya sabha ne france kii prashasnic sanrachana main parivartan kiya
 The entire country was divided into 83 departments by abolishing the ancient provinces

 There was an Election Council to run the rule of each of the units, which were elected by active citizens
 is tarah sthaneey str se lekar kendriya str tak sari rajya vyavastha bargea varg main aa gai
 After the dissolution of the National Assembly, in 1791 AD, a 745-member administrative body came into existence
 is vyavasthapika sabha main adhyaksh ke daahine haath kii ore baithne vaale 'dakshinpanthi' kehalaae
 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd
 isamen pramukh netaa the- dante, robspier, heater aadi
 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places
 faltah videshi yuddh main france kii paraajay neshnal kanveshan ke samaksh ek mukhya samasya ban gai
 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich
 in kadamon kaa jirondixton ne virodh kiya
 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians
 jiske anusaar “saamaanya ichha” hi saarvbhaumik ichha he
 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed
 tritiy charan-1794-99 -“diarectory” kaa shashan vastutah neshnal kanvension ne ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan kar karypalika kaa uttardaayitv 5 sadasyeey “nideshak mandal” ko saunpa
 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i
 main usne apane ko samraat ghoshit kar diya or is tarah nepolian ke taanaashaahee samrajyavaadee shashan kii shuruuaat hui
 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution
 kranti ke pratham charan main netritv tritiy state ke burjuai tatwon ke haathon main tha
 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property
 vastutah samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa to kar di gai kintu saamanti adhikaron ko yun hi nahin chhod diya gaya, balki bhumipatiyon kii kshatipurti karne ke baad hi kisaan kisi uttardaayitv se mukt ho sakate the
 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges
 neshnal essembali dwaara 1792 i
 main compene naamak angeraj nayak ko francisi naagarik kii oopaadhi di gai or use neshnal kanvension kaa pratinidh bhi chunaa gaya
 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong
 isamen ek aise yuddh kii kalpana kii gai jisamen francisi senaayen padosi deshon main pravesh kar vahaan ke sthaneey krantikariyon se milakar rajtantr ko apdasth kar ganatantron kii sthapana karti he
 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he

 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France
 europea desh ke kisaan abhi udaasi kii sthiti main the
 But the French peasants had become independent
 unke paas apni jameen apana makaan itani suvidha ke baavjud samant kar evam samant sevaaon kaa ant nahin hua tha unhen apni aamadani kaa bahut bada hissaa samant kar ke rup main chukaana padataa tha
 And still his position is good
 ve paise bachaakar kuch na- kuch jameen kharid liya karte the jameen kharidne kii bhukh nirantar badhati ja rahi thi isamen samant kar va berogari baadhak the at: ve samant peshon ko hataane kii baat soch rahe the at: madhyam varg ke netritv main unhe bal mila or 1789 i
 main unhone vidroh kar diya
 Lack of tradition of liberal autocracy in France- anya europea deshon main bhi nirankush rajtantr tha
 But the emperors there had reduced their autocracy over time
 prasha kaa raja fredirak apane samay kaa mahaan prabud prashaasak tha
 Other countries of Europe followed by Russia, Italy, Spain etc
 unhone samaynusaar jaataa kii aarthik bhautik tathaa anya kshetron main unnat karne kaa yatha sambhav prayaas kiya
 But France lacked such liberal autocracy
 vahaan ke raja janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe the
 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 Awareness of medium france main hi sarvapratham kranti hone kaa kaaran vahaan kaa madhyamvarg tha
 Other countries also had a middle class but they were not as cultural, rich and educated as in France
 unamem shakti kaa abhaav tha
 They could not think of rebelling against the king
 france main madhyam varg ke log anek kaaran se apane samraaton se asantusht the
 And for his own defense, Raj was desperate to curb power
 anya europea rajyon main is tarah kii sthiti kaa abhaav tha
 There was no one to lead in other countries, there was a ready middle class in France
 at: sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Usefulness of noble class kuleen vahg ko pahase visheshadhikaar is liye diya gaya tha ki ve shashan chalaane main raja kii madad kare
 And they also used to protect Janata
 parantu dhire – 2 yah kaary raja ke karmchaaree karne laga
 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended
 phir bhi iske visheshadhikaar main kisi prakaar kii katautee nahin kii gai
 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility
 darshanikon kaa prabhaav- In the 18th century, there was a chaotic movement throughout Europe
 darshanik, vichaarak, vaagyanik sabhi deshon main viddhman the
 But the main among them were the French thinkers
 jinhone kranti kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar prastut kiya
 He drew the attention of the people to the evils in the society and gave a voice to the people
 is tarah kaa prayaas anya deshon main nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 France was the only field of thinkers like Montague, Voltaire Russo
 austria, prasha or rus main is tarah ke vichaarak nahin the
 In other countries of Europe, there was no class of philosophers who gave their real status and created satisfaction in them
 france main hi kranti hone kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Lack of political participation england main jab madhyam varg ne jaagarukta ai to use desh kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar diya gaya
 But this was not the case with France
 france kaa madhyam varg apane samraaton se kaaphi asantusht tha
 They were expected
 shikshit hone ke baavjood unhen kulinon kii tarah pratishtha uplabdh nahin thi
 They were not given the opportunity to participate in French politics
 isliye unhone asantusht hokar kranti kaa naaraa buland kiya
 Ineligible king and corruption in administration- france kii rajanithik vyavastha kendrikrut thi lekin raja ayogy the
 The administration was dominated by corruption
 europe ke anya deshon main nirankush shashan totha parantu raja yogya the or shashan par unka purn niyantran tha
 The middle class of France was feeling this administrative corruption
 tathaa isliye vah vidroh karne ke liye taiyaar tha
 Rise of national spirit is samay europe main teji se rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai hone laga
 France was the only country in entire Europe where there was a complete lack of a national spirit
 iske chalate bhi sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Effect of American freedom struggle- 1766 i
 main american swatantraaa sangram prarambh hua
 The American people revolted against England
 france ke sainikon ko bhi is swatantraaa sangram main bhaag lene kaa avasar mila at: unhone yah mahasus kiya ki yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa prapti kii ja sakati he
 He also realized that freedom is possible only through freedom
 france lautne par unhone dekha kii jis swatantraaa ko liye unhonen america main yuddh kiya usee swatantraaa kaa france main purnat: abhaav he
 Hence, he became restless for the revolution here and tried to get freedom through war
 europe ke anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 Superiority of French Civilization france main hi kranti hone kaa ek vishisht kaaran yah tha ki yahan kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe rashtron kii apeksha adhik samrudh or vaibhav purna thi
 Even in terms of governance, the rule of France was highly organized
 france sampoorn europe sabhyataa or saanskriti kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Paris is considered the largest center of literature and thought in all of Europe
 france janamat anya europe rajyon kii apeksha adhik jaagrit or aalochanatmak tha
 As a result of all these reasons, in 1789 AD, there was revolution in France and not in other European states

 At the same time, an analog computer was installed at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, which was used as a differential analyzer
 lekin in sab ke baad bhi bharat main computer yug kii vaastavik rup se shuruyaat hui san 1956 main, jab ai es ai kolkata main bharat kaa pratham electronic digital computer HEC - 2M sthapit kiya gaya
