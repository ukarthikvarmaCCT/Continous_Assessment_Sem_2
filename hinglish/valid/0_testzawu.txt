 yah granth tripitak ke teen bhaagon main se ek he
 Sutta Pitaka is a collection of principles of Lord Buddha in the form of arguments and dialogues
 inamen gadhy samvaad hai, muktak chand hai tathaa choti-choti pracheen kahaniyaan hai
 It is divided into five bodies or collections
 
 There are five parts of this Pitaka which are called nāyaka
 nikaay kaa arth he samooh
 Small and big sutas are stored in these five parts
 isiilie ve nikaay kehalaate hai
 The word "sangeeti" has also been used for the body
 aarambh main, jab ki tripitak lipibaddh nahin tha, bhikshu ek saath sutton kaa parayan karte the
 Accordingly, his five collections were called Sangeeti
 baad main nikaay shabd kaa adhik prachlan hua or sangeeti shabd kaa bahut kam
 Many threads have a bug
 ek hi sutt ke kai bhaan bhi hote hai
 8000 letters are bhanwar
 tadnusaar ek-ek nikaay kii akshar sankhya kaa bhi nirdhaaran ho saktaa he
 For example, there are 34 suttas of longing and 64 of bhanavars
 is prakaar saare dirghanikaay main 512000 akshar hai
 The Sutas contain the teachings of certain disciples like God and Sariputra Maudgalyayan, Anand
 shishyon ke upadesh bhi bhagwaan dwaara anumodith hai
 Each Sutta has a role, which has a large historical view
 usamen in maton kaa ullekh he ki kab, kis sthaan par, kis vyakti yaa kin vyaktiyon ko vah upadesh diya gaya tha or shrotaaon par uskaa kya prabhaav padaa
 Most suttas are in prose, some in verse and some in prose-verse
 ek hi upadesh kai sutton main aayaa he- kahin sankshep main or kahin vistaar main
 They have a plurality of repetitions
 unke sankshipteekaran ke liye "payyal" kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Is somewhat mature
 unamem kahin-kahin aakhyaanon or aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa bhi prayog kiya gaya he
 There is also a large stock of Sutpitaka similes
 kabhi-kabhi bhagwaan upamaaon ke sahare bhi upadesh dete the
 The audience ranged from king to color, naive farmer to great philosopher
 un sabake anuroop ye upmaayen jivan ke anek kshetron si lee gai hai
 Buddha biography, religion, philosophy, history, etc
 From all points of view, Sutpitaka is the most important part of Tripitaka
 buddhagaya ke bodhigamya ke neeche buddhatv kii prapti se lekar kushinagar main mahaparinirvana tak 45 varsh bhagwaan buddha ne jo lokseva kii, uskaa vivaran suttapitak main miltaa he
 Which Mahajanapadas he charika in the middle division, how they got mixed with people, how they paved the way from small problems to big problems, what they got in the promotion of their message Difficulties had to be faced- we get a description of all these things in Sutpitaka
 bhagwaan buddha ke jivan sambandhi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa varnan hi nahin; apitu unke mahaan shishyon kii jivan jhaankiyaan bhi isamen milti hai
 The greatest importance of suttapitaka lies in the means assigned by God
 vah sheel, samadhi or pragna rupi teen shikshaaon main nihit he
 The audience had people of many levels in terms of intelligence, moral and spiritual development
 un sabhi ke anuroop anek prakaar se unhone arya maarg kaa upadesh diya tha, jisamen panchasheel se lekar das parmitaayen tak shaamil hai
 The main religion synonyms are as follows - Four Arya Satya, Ashtangik Marg, Seven Bodhyangas, Four Samyak Pradhan Five senses, Pratitya Samutpada, Skandha Volume Metal Formed Sanskrit Religion Continuous sorrow-infinite-form Sanskrit traits
 inamen bhi santis ksheeya dharm hi bhagwaan ke upadeshon kaa saar he
 He wrote this in Mahaparinirvana Sutta
 yadi ham bhagwaan ke mahatvapurn upadeshon kii drushti se sutton kaa vishleshnatmak adhyayan karen to hamen unamem ghuma firaakar ye hi dharmaparyaay milenge
 The only difference is that they are brief and in some detail
 udaahranarth sutt nikaay ke praarambhik sutton main chaar satyon kaa ullekh maatr miltaa he, dhammachakkapavattan sutt main vistrut vivaran miltaa he or mahasatipatthan main inaki vishad vyakhya bhi milti he
 The main theme of Sutas is the religion and philosophy of Tathagata
 lekin prakarantar se or vishyon par bhi prakaash padataa he
 Other Shramana and Brahmin sects such as complex, parivrajaka, ajivak and nigantha which were prevalent at that time, have also been described in statutes
 ve sankhya main 62 bataae gaye hai
 There are many theories on Yajna and casteism
 desh magadh, koshal, vajji jaise kai rajyon main vibhajit tha
 Somewhere there was royalty rule and somewhere republican state
 unka aapas kaa sambandh kaisaa tha, shashan prashasan kaary kaise hote the- in baton kaa bhi ullekh kahin-kahin miltaa he
 The state of ordinary people, their way of living, ethics, food storage, industry, business, education, initiation, arts, knowledge, science, entertainment, sports etc
 have also been described
 gram, nigam, rajdhani, janapad, nadi, parvat, van, tadaag, maarg, ritu aadi bhugolic baton kii bhi charchaa kam nahin he
 Thus we see that the importance of Sutpitaka is not only in terms of religion and philosophy, but also in terms of political, social and geographical position of Buddha India
 in sutton main uplabdh saamagree kaa adhyayan karke vidwaanon ne niabandh likhakar anek pahaluon par prakaash daalaa he
 The five bodies of Sutpitaka are as follows: Deep body, Majjhim body, Samyutta body, Angusadha body and Khudka body

 kapuchino yah ek italian coffee peya he jo aspreso, garm doodh or bhaap se gadha kiye doodh ke jhaag se banataa he
 The name derives from the Kapuchin friars which is associated with the color of their habits
 kapuchino ek aisi coffee he jiske upar jhaagdar doodh daalaa jaataa he
 It is made in a steam making espresso machine
 pehle aspreso coffee ko cap ke bilkul neeche ek-tihaai tak daalaa jaataa he or phir usamen utani hi maatra main garm doodh milaayaa jaataa he
 Then in the upper one-third, thick milk froth prepared a minute or two before, this foam is often decorated in a very artistic way so that it looks like a pointed mound
 aksar chhila hua chocolate, kachi chini, dalacheenee or anya masaalon ko purnataya taiyaar kiye peya ke upar chhidak kar sajaavat kii jaati he

 The espresso machines used to make the cappuccino were first introduced in the 20th century when Luigi Bezerra of Milan first filed for a patent in 1901
 In the early 19th century, the Cappuccino flourished in Italy, and its popularity also increased greatly when large espresso machines used in cafes and restaurants were greatly improved during and after World War II
 , Especially when in 1948 an Italian company called Gagia introduced a modern, high-pressure espresso machine

 In Italy, Cappuccino is consumed as a morning drink, and after 11

 Apart from a portion of espresso coffee, the most important thing in the method of making cappuccino is the texture and temperature of the milk
 When the barista boils the milk to make cappuccino, very fine air bubbles are released into the milk, creating a microfoam and giving the milk a velvety texture
 paramparaagat rup se banane vaali kapuchino main aspreso coffee ke upar barist garm jhaagdar doodh daalata he jisase peya ke upar 2 sein

 Variety of these mixtures are named: Cappuccino Cairo) in which the milk content is higher than normal and Cappuccino Scarro) in which the quantity of thick milk is less than normal

 By the mid-1990s, high-profile coffee houses began to emerge in North America, and Cappuccino became more widely available to North Americans
 italy or puure europe mahadweep main, paramparaagat rup se kapuchino kaa seven subah ke naashte main kuch mithi pastery ke saath kiya jaataa tha
 Generally, Europeans do not consume cappuccino with any food other than morning breakfast, but prefer to drink espresso throughout the day and after dinner
 haalanki haal hi ke kuch varshon main europea logon ne puure din bhar kapuchino pinaa shuru kar diya he
 Sitting at cafes and rooftops in the afternoon, especially in Western Europe, and enjoying cappuccino in restaurants after dinner is a very popular routine

 Cold cappuccino is called cappuccino fredo, in which cold frothy milk is often poured over the drink
 yah peya italy ke un kshetron main vyapak rup se uplabdh he jahaan is peya main barf nahin daali jaati
 udahaaran ke liye, rome main har 'baar' main is peya ko pehle se hi taiyaar karke rakhaa jaataa he
 But in northern cities, such as Milan, Cappuccino's meeting Fredo is almost impossible
 balki iske badale main "gelato da bere" yaa "shakerato" isse kahin zyaada lokapriy hai
 The term has also become popular throughout the Mediterranean region, where frothy milk is added moments before the beverage is introduced, which is often different from the Italian method
 uttar america main, yadi "kapuchino fredo" yaa "iced kapuchino" ko, isaki khaasiyat, jhaagdar doodh ke bagaiyr pesh kiya jaae to yah naam ayatharth mana ja saktaa he
 For example, in 'starbucks', a beverage made without frothy milk is called 'iced latte'
 thande doodh ko bhi vibhinn tareeqon se jhaagdar banaaya ja saktaa he
 By the beginning of the 21st century, fast-food chains such as 'starbucks' had started offering Kapucchino in a changed, larger and different form of 600 milli
 But over the years, leading independent cafes have only been introduced to Cappuccino according to its traditional scale of 150–180 milli - giving them a distinct identity from other cafes and large fast-food chains
 'starbax' main ek "laghu" kapuchino bhi milti he240 mili, lekin uskaa zikr na to menu main miltaa he, na hi website par
 Following the widespread acceptance of Cappuccino, many establishments such as convenience stores were born and these establishments offered their customers a drink named Cappuccino
 saadharantah yah peya mashiinon dwaara, coca mishran se bane peya kii hi tarah, yaa to taiyaar mishran se yaa dabl bru kiye coffee se banaaya jaataa he
 a drink made in this way is completely different from a regular cappuccino

 On activating the machine, its whipping impeller begins to rotate, then a mixture of dry powder and water is added to the chamber, the consistency of the finished beverage is entirely dependent on how quickly the powder mixture is added
 is prakriya se jhaag kaa nirmaan hona to swaabhaavik he
 Some machines have the feature that small amounts of different flavored liquids stored in small disposable pouches are added to the coffee and thus different flavors such as 'moka' and 'bhanila' in the same mixing chamber
 Cappuccino can be prepared
 chunki sabhi samagriyaan yaa to sookhe powder ke rup main milteen hai yaa sadan-rahit dispozable packaging main, isliye in paddatiyon ko bahut hi kam rakh-rakhaav kii zarurat padati he, sirf mixing chember or impeler kii safaai kerani padati he
 To further reduce maintenance, when the operator presses the 'fill button', most of the machines continue for a few moments without any powder so that clear water can flow into the mixing chamber and the chamber is cleaned
 iske alaava, gharon main upyog ke liye taiyaar mishranon kaa utpaadan bhi kiya jaataa he
 By mixing these powders with hot water or milk, a beverage can be prepared as found in convenient stores; These are often advertised as "frothy coffee"

 In one ashram, he saw the master of a very old religion, the great ascetic, the mindless mindless God, Jitendriya, Jitatma, Jitakrodha, who knows the esoteric elements of Sanatana Dharma, the master of all the scriptures, Mahatma Lomash Muni, whom Kalpa a Rome used to fall when it passed
 sabane jaakar rishi ko pranaam kiya
 Seeing those people, the sage asked, what is the reason that you have come? i will definitely interest you guys
 meraa janm keval dusron ke upkaar ke liye hua he, isamen andeh mat karo
 Hearing such words of Lomash Rishi, everyone said - o Maharshe! You are more capable than Brahma in knowing our point
 at: aap hamaare is andeh ko dur kiijie
 The godly king of Mahishmati Puri obeys Mahjit Praja like a son
 phir bhi vah putraheen hone ke kaaran du:khee he
 Those people further said that we are his subjects
 at: uske du:kha se ham bhi du:khee hai
 With your philosophy we are confident that this crisis of ours will definitely go away, because many sufferings are overcome with the mere sight of great men
 ab aap krupa karke raja ke putr hone kaa upaay batalaayen
 Hearing this talk, the sage closed his eyes for a while and after knowing the account of the previous birth of the king, he said that this king was a poor Vaishya in the previous life
 nirdhan hone ke kaaran isane kai bure karm kiye
 It used to go from one village to another
 ek samay jyeshtha maas ke shukla paksh kii dwadashi ke din madhyahn ke samay vah jabaki vah do din se bhookha-pyaasa tha, ek jalashay par jal pine gaya
 An immediate married thirsty cow was drinking water at the same place
 raja ne us pyaasi gaay ko jal pite hue hataa diya or swayan jal pine laga, isiilie raja ko yah du:kha sahanaa padaa
 Due to starvation on Ekadashi, he became the king and due to the removal of the thirsty cow from drinking water, the son has to suffer the sorrow of disconnection
 aisa sunakar sab log kehane lage ki he rishi! shastron main paapon kaa praayshchit bhi likhaa he
 So, as soon as this king's sin is destroyed, you give such a solution
 lomash muni kehane lage ki shravan shukla paksh kii ekadshi ko jise putrada ekadshi bhi kehete hai, tum sab log vrath karo or raatri ko jaagran karo to isse raja kaa yah purv janm kaa paap avashya nasht ho jayega, saath hi raja ko putr kii avashya prapti hogi
 On hearing such words of Lomash Rishi, the whole people including ministers returned to the city and when Shravan Shukla Ekadashi came, everyone observed and awakened Putrada Ekadashi according to the sage's knowledge
 iske pashchaat dwadashi ke din iske punya kaa fal raja ko diya gaya
 With the virtue of that virtue, the queen conceived and at the end of delivery, a great bright son was born to her
 isliye he rajan! is shravan shukla ekadshi kaa naam putrada padaa
 Therefore, those who achieve the desire for child happiness must do this fast
 iske mahatmaya ko sunne se manushya sab paapon se mukt ho jaataa he or is lok main santan sukh bhogakar paralok main swarg ko praapt hota he
 Putrada Ekadashi also falls in Paushakula == See also == lakshmi raman acharya,bharat ke uttar pradesh kii pratham vidhansabha sabha main vidhayak rahe

 bharat main aadhunik banking sevaaon kaa itihaas do sau varsh purana he
 Modern banking of India began in the British Raj
 19veen shatabdi ke aarambh main british east india company ne 3 bainkon kii shuruyaat kii - bank of bengal 1809 main, bank of bombai 1840 main or bank of madras 1843 main
 But later these three banks were merged into a new bank 'imperial Bank' which was merged with 'state Bank of India' in 1955
 elahabaad bank bharat kaa pehla nijee bank tha
 The Reserve Bank of India was established in 1935 and later Punjab National Bank, Bank of India, Canara Bank and Indian Bank were established

 The amount of total moisture present in a certain volume of air is called absolute humidity
 yah ardrata vaayu ke nishchit aaytan par jalawaashp ke bhaar ko pradarshit karti hai
 It is displayed in grains on cubic feet and in grams per cubic centimeter
 urja ke anya sroton se vidyut shakti kaa nirmaan vidyut utpaadan kehalaata he
 In practice, electric power is produced by electric generators
 vidyut utpaadan ke moolbhoot siddhanth kii khoj angrej vaigyanik micel farade ne 1920 ke dashak ke dauraan evam 1930 ke dashak ke aarmabhik kaal main kiya tha
 Michael Faraday's original method of generating electricity by twisting a coil of wire into a magnetic field is still used today
 vidyut kaa utpaadan jahaan kiya jaataa he use bijlighar kehete hai
 Power is generated by electro-mechanical generators in power stations, which are rotated by some other device, it is called the main generator or main driver
 prime mover ke liye jal terbine, vaashp terbine yaa gas terbine ho sakati he
 Electric power is produced from water, coal, heat, nuclear reactions, wind power and many other methods
 vidyut shakti ke liye, vastut:, teen sanghatak aavashyak hai : The driver, which is in practice a carrier group arranged according to a set arrangement, chumbakeey kshetra, vyaavhaarik rup main ek kundali main vidyut dhara pravaahit karke praapt kiya jaataa he or The mechanism of moving the conductive group in a magnetic field, which means the provision of mechanical energy
 vastut:, yahi yantric urja, vidyut urja ke rup main parivartit hoti he or urja avinashita niyam kaa pratipaadan karti he
 Based on the above discussion, any power generator has three main components: 1
 chaalkon ko dhaaran karanevaale armechar kii, jo samanyat: naram lohe ke patlit staron kaa bana hota he, paridhi ke chaaron ore khaanche bane hote hai, jinamein chaalan kundaliyaan rakhi jaati hai
 The drivers are arranged according to a certain arrangement, which is called armature kundalan
 2
 kshetra kundali - isamen dhara ke pravaahit hone par chumbakeey kshetra kii utpatti hoti he
 3
 Elastic of mechanical power - It is generally a prime driver
 yah jal kaa tarabine, bhaap kaa tarabine, bhaap kaa ingine, athwa dijal ingine main se koi bhi ho saktaa he
 According to the type of current, electric generators are mainly of two types: direct current generator and alternating current generator
 yadhyapi mulat: donon ke mul siddhant ek hi hote hai, parantu banaavat ke drushtikon se unamem kaaphi antar hota he
 In a direct current generator, the magnetic field is generated by fixed field coils and rotating the conductive device mounted on the armature
 is prakaar, chumbakeey abhivah ko kaatane se usamen ek voltata janit hoti he
 In fact, for the generation of voltage, it is not necessary that the conductor itself has speed
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki chaalaktantr sthir ho or chumbakeey abhiva unako katata hua jayega iskaa taatpary yah he ki chumbakeey kshetra gatisheel ho or chaalak apane sthaan par hi rahe
 Either way it is necessary to have a relative speed in the conductor and the magnetic field, so that the voltage can be generated in the conductor
 vastut:, donon vidhiyaan hi vyaavhaarik he or prayavarti dharaa janitron main, jinhen prayavartitra bhi kehete hai, chaalak samooh achal hota he or use stator kehete hai
 The poles and coils that produce magnetic fields are rotational parts and are called rotors
 armechar ko achal rakhane kaa mukhya laabh yah he ki is prakaar saapekshatya ucchtar voltata janit kii ja sakati he
 For high voltage generation, either the number of conductors has to be increased, or the rotational wave, or both
 chaalak kii sankhya badhaane se armechar kaa aakaar bahut bad jaataa he or uske ghurni bhaag hone ke kaaran apkendri bal itnaa bad jayega ki sanrachana ke drushtikon se chaalkon ko apane sthanon par sthir rakhana bhi ek samasya ho jaaegi
 Larger size rotational parts are not suitable from the standpoint of design and neither their velocity can be increased very much
 at:, ghurni armechar vaale janitron main ucch voltata janit karnaa parisimit ho jaataa he, parantu yadi achal ho, to uskaa aakaar bhi bada banaaya ja saktaa he or apkendri bal kaa bhi prashn nahin uthta
 Also, the current generated has to be transported with static contacts, which is very accessible
 ghurni armecharon main janit dhara ko kurcho dwaara hi bahari paripath main le jaaya ja saktaa he
 The problem with the field being rotor is not so complicated, because the excitatory current flowing in it is, relatively, very low
 uttejan keval disht dhara se hi sambhav he or prayavarti dhara janitron main kshetra uttejan ke liye disht dhara sambharak kaa hona aavashyak he, jo saamanyat: isi shift par aropit ek chote se disht dhara janitr dwaara, jise uttejk kehete hai, praavdhaan kiya jaataa he
 In armature drivers, the voltages generated by the relative motion, relative to the magnetic field, are virtually reversible
 kisi bhi kshan par iskaa pariman chumbakeey kshetra ke chaalkon kii saapeksh sthiti par nirbhar karata he
 a similar voltage is induced in the armature of a direct current generator, but is received as a specified current in an external circuit by a transformer
 dik parivartak armechar ke saath usee isha, par aropit hota he or armechar chaalak nishchit vyavastha ke anusaar uske tamra khandon se yojit hote hai
 There is a provision of burrows, which are usually of carbon and mounted in the burrush holder, to carry the current from the transformer to the external circuit
 jahaan tak yantric shakti kaa prashn he, vah chaahe to kisi tarabine se athwa ingine se praapt kii ja sakati he, yaa nadi ke behate hue pani se, jisamen aseem shakti kaa bhandar nihit he
 Efforts are being made to harness the energy contained in the tidal ebb of the sea and the reserves of uneven power hidden in the volcanic mountains
 parmanviya shakti kaa upyog to vidyut utpaadan ke liye shighrata se bad rahaa he or bahut se bade bade parmanviya bijlighar banaae gaye hai, parantu abhi tak, mukhyat:, teen prakaar ke bijli ghar hi saamaanya hai : pen, bhaap evam deazal ingine chaalit
 Hydroelectric power stations are built in such places where sufficient water can be collected by easily damming a river and water turbines can be run by dropping it from trenches at high altitude
 ye tarabine, vidyut janitron ke pradhan chaalak hote hai
 The rivers flowing through the mountains contain immense water power
 aise bijlighar banane ke liye pehle saare kshetra kaa surveykshan kiya jaataa he or sabase upyukt aisa sthaan khoja jaataa he jahaan nunatam parishram or laagat se yathasambhav bada band banaaya ja sake
 The cost of such power stations is very high, but their operating expenses are very less
 aise bijligharon kii sthapana, mukhyat:, upyukt sthaan par nirbhar karti he
 It may be that these powerhouses are far away from the industry site
 aisi dasha main bahut lambii sancharan line bhi banani pad sakati hai
 Therefore, to prove the meaning of the construction of such power stations, it is also necessary to keep an idea of the transmission distance and its decoration
 bhaap chaalit bijligharon main bhaap se chalanevaale tarabine hote hai
 The use of steam locomotives has become practically outdated
 bhaap tarabine, saadharantaya, ucch veg par chaalan karte hai or santat prachaalan ke liye banaae jate hai
 Steam is used at high pressure in most turbines, requiring a high pressure vaporizer
 600 pound prati varg inch kaa dabaav ab saamaanya ho gaya he or aadhunik tarabine to isse bhi adhik dabaav par prachaalan karne ke liye banaae ja rahe hai
 Turbines are now being successfully used in this field
 tarabine kii rachana main nity nae shodh ho rahe hai jisase bhaap chaalit bijligharon kii dakshata or bhi adhik badhaai ja sake
 Nowadays more attention is being paid in setting up nuclear power stations
 parmanviya bijlighar bahut se deshon main banaae gaye hai or unki badi badi yojanaayen banaai ja rahi hai
 In the last 10 years, very large nuclear power plants have been built in Britain, USA and Russia and many are being built
 inkaa mukhya laabh yah he ki ye bhaar kendro ke sannikat banaae ja sakate hai, jisase lambii sancharan linon kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 In addition, due to the very low amount of fuel, transportation expenses and its problems remain
 parantu inkaa pratishthapan vyay saapekshatya adhik hota he or phir inaki prachaalan pranali abhi tak shodh kaa vishay he
 The determination of their installation is very controversial due to the continuous new research in the systems
 jo pranali aaj se paanch saal pehle apanaai jaati thi, vah ab gai beeti baat ho chuki he
 Secondly, making them only in a big way can be economically and technically appropriate
 utpaadit kii gai sari shakti kaa upyog usee sthal par ho janaa saadharantaya sambhav nahin hota
 It is important to note that other sources of power are constantly getting depleted, or it may be said that most of them are finally going to end
 anumaan ke anusaar yadi sansar main koyale kii khapat isi prakaar hoti rahi, to vartmaan koyale kii khaane sansar ko adhiktam 200 varsh tak koyala detii rah sakati hai
 Similarly, the same can be said about the origin of oil
 jalavidyut bhandar avay hi samaapt honevaala nahin he, parantu ye bhandar saamanyat: upyog sthalon se bahut dur hai
 For example, in the waters of the Brahmaputra river, at the site of entering the border of India, about 35 lakh kva
 Strength is ability
 par pratham to vahaan bijlighar kii sthapana karnaa itnaa sugam nahin or duusare yah sthaan upyog sthalon se lagbhag 500 mile dur he
 There is estimated to be around 40 and 109 tons of coal in India and hydroelectric power, which is possible to be available, is about 40 and 106 kw
 is
 ye aankade kaaphi ashaapad prathit hote hai, parantu yadi hamaara str bhi america tathaa duusare gatisheel deshon ke samaan ho or prati manushya utan hi vidyut kii khapat ho, to itani shakti bhi hamaare liye bahut aparyaapt hogi
 In this case, it is natural that atomic power is used
 chote nagaron, athwa chote udyogon ke vaiyaktik sanbharanon, ke liye deazal injanon kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he
 These sets are mostly of low capacity
 ye panbijaligharon evam tapiya bijligharon kii tarah bade aakaaron main nahin banaae ja sakate tathaa inase utpaadit vidyut shakti kaa prati unit mulya bhi saapekshatya kahin adhik hota he, parantu chote sanbharanon ke liye ve bahut hi upyogi hote hai
 They can be run easily and are able to take loads in a few minutes
 is kaaran ye atirikt sanchayak ke rup main bahut upyogi hote hai
 Diesel-powered power stations, which have been closed due to being economically expensive, are also being used as additional accumulators
 deazal ingine kaa sthaan aajkal gas tarabine le rahaa he
 Gas turbines have much higher efficiency than these and can be built in larger sizes, but they operate at much higher temperatures and pressures
 adhik dakshata ke liye or bhi unche taap par prachaalan karnaa aavashyak he or abhi aise padaarthon kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin ho paaya he jinka upyog gas tarabinon ke nirmaan main vyaavhaarik rup se kiya ja sake
 Therefore, gas turbine has not been very common in the production of electric power
 prakruti main vidyutsakti ke aseem saadhan vidyaman hai
 In addition to the above mentioned means, there are some such instruments which have attracted human attention in the last 50 years only
 samudr ke jowar-bhaate main aparimit shakti vidyaman he
 In France and Britain this power has also been used for power generation
 samudri jowar ke samay nadi ke muhane kii ore badhate hue pani ko ek ore khulanevaale band dwaara ghire jalashay main bhar liya jaataa he
 After the water in the reservoir is filled at the time of tide, at the time of ebb, it is not allowed to return to the sea
 phir to is jalashay ke pani kaa kam unche sheershawale bijlighar kii bhanti hi jalavidyut janan ke liye upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 In such power stations, the runner of nozzles and turbine should be of such a metal, usually bronze, on which the saline water of the sea cannot react chemically
 bharat main bhi jowar bhaata bijlighar banane kii yojana banaai ja rahi he or agle 20 varshon main aise bijligharon ke saamaanya ho jane kaa sahal hi anumaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Geothermal energy: The second infinite means of power is the fierce heat contained in the end of volcanic mountains
 yadi is antstal ko chhedakar uski garam gas kaa bijlighar ke vaashpitron main prayukt kiya ja sake, to sahaj hi aparimit shakti kaa bhandar khul jayega
 In New Zealand, such a powerhouse has been operationalized
 vahaan 30 g
z
 kaa ek bijlighar jwalamukhi kii shakti kaa upyog kar rahaa he
 Such power stations are also being planned in Italy and Japan and thus till now the volcanoes which were famous only for their fierceness, will now be leading in the field of utility
 saura urja: surya bhi vidyutsakti kaa aseem saadhan he
 Till date, it has been used only experimentally to produce electric power, but plans are being made to build solar power plants in the scorching sun of the Sahara and Arabian deserts and it is expected that it will be the most important tool in future
 Will become
