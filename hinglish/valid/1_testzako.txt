 jab kisi rasinic abhikriya kii gati kisi padaarth kii upasthiti maatr se batch jaati he to ise utpreran kehete hai
 The substance whose presence increases the reaction speed is called a catalyst
 utprerak abhikriya main bhaag nahin letaa, keval kriya kii gati ko prabhavit karata he
 Catalysts have a huge role in the manufacture of industrially important chemicals, as their use increases the speed of the reaction, which in many ways brings economic benefits and accelerates production
 isaliye utpreran ke kshetra main anusandhan ke liye bahut sa dhan evam maanav shram laga hua he
 First of all in 1835, Bergelyus drew attention to some chemical actions in which the speed of action would be accelerated in the presence of certain external substances, but the external matter did not participate in that activity
 udarharnarth yadi ichu sharkara ko amlon kii upasthiti main garam karen to vah badi shighrata se glucose tathaa fructose main parivartit ho jaati he
 Acid does not participate in this activity
 vah pun: kaam main liya ja saktaa he
 Bergelyus called this action "catalysis" and called those substances "catalysts" in whose presence the action begins to take place
 ostwald ne utprerak padaartho kii paribhaasha is prakaar di he: ""utprerak us padaarth ko kehete hai jo kisi rasinic kriya ke veg ko badal de, parantu swayan kriya ke ant main aparivartit rahata he, at: use pun: kaam main laayaa ja saktaa he
 In most actions, the catalyst increases the reaction speed
 aise utprerakon ko dhanatmak utprerak kehete he; parantu kuch aise bhi utprerak he jo rasinic kriya kii gati ko mand kar dete hai
 Such catalysts are called negative catalysts
 utpreran kii mukhya visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai: Almost all catalyzed actions can be divided into two parts: isomeric catalytic actions; Activated catalytic actions
 in kriyaaon main utprerak, pratikarmak tathaa pratifal sabhi ek hi avasthaa main upasthit hote hai
 For example, in the conventional method of making sulfuric acid, sulfuric acid is formed by the addition of sulfur dioxide, steam and oxygen and this action is catalyzed by nitric oxide
 is kriya main pratikarmak, utprerak tathaa pratifal isi gasiy avasthaa main rahete hai
 In these activities, catalysts, reagents and byproducts are present in different states
 yatha, ammonia banane kii habar-vidhi main nitrogen tathaa hydrogen kii sanyogkriya kii ferick oxide utprerit karata he
 Hydrogenation of vegetable oils in the presence of micro-nickel is another example of this type of action
 kuch padaarth apni upasthiti se rasinic kriya ke veg par prabhaav nahin daalate, parantu kuch duusare utprerakon kii kriya ko prabhavit karte hai
 Of these substances, which increase the reactivity of catalysts, catalysts and those substances that reduce the reactivity of catalysts are called anti-catalysts or catalytic toxins
 aatm utprerak-kuch pratikriyaayein aisi bhi gyaat hai jinamein pratikraya se hi utpann koi padaarth pratikriya ke liye utprerak kaa kaary karata he
 For example, the acetic acid obtained in the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate catalyzes the action of ester hydrolysis
 yadhyapi utpreran ko samajhane samajhane ke liye bahut pehle se adhyayan hote chale aa rahe hai, tathaapi is vishay main abhi antim nishkarsh nahin niklaa he
 Scientists agree that not all catalysts act according to the same principle
 utpreran kii vyavastha ke liye do siddhant kaam main laae jate hai- madhyavarti yogic siddhant; adhishoshan siddhant
 1
 Intermediate Compound Theory- This is a chemical theory for explaining catalysis
 iske anusaar utprerak pehle pratikarmakon main se ek ke saath kriya karke ek madhyavarti asthaayee yogic banaata he; phir vah madhyavarti asthaayee yogic duusare pratikarmakon se kriya karke pratifal detaa he tathaa utprerak pun: apni purvavastha main aa jaataa he
 Accordingly, the combination of the reagents "a" and "b" is expressed in the presence of catalyst "c" in the following way: kriya ke ant tak yahi kram chalata rahata he
 The explanation of the catalysis of certain actions by intermediate compound theory is straightforward
 parantu adhikansh vishmavayavi kriyaaon tathaa utprerak vardhakon athwa vishon kii kriyaaon ko samajhaana kathin yaa asambhav sa he
 2
 Adsorption theory - This is the physical principle for the interpretation of catalysis
 is siddhant ke anusaar pratikarmak utprerak ke tal par ghaneebhoot ho jate hai
 Thus by increasing the concentration of reagents at the catalytic plane, the velocity of action increases according to the quantity-proportional-law
 ab uparyukt donon siddhanton ko milakar ek nayaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya gaya he
 Accordingly, there are some active centers at the bottom of the catalytic material
 in kendron main anuon yaa parmaanuon ko adhishoshit karne kii kshamta hoti he
 Therefore, the concentration of the reagents on the metal floor increases the concentration, which leads to an increase in action, as well as the repellents at these active centers, forming temporary compounds, which according to the intermediate compound theory of catalysis Let's do the work
 prakinv jatil jaivik padaarth hote hai jo paudhon yaa praaniyon se praapt kiye jate hai
 They have proved to be excellent catalysts in most reactions
 ped paudhon main honevaali lagbhag sabhi kriyaaon main anzime utprerak kaa kaary karte hai
 Apart from this, fermentation also acts as an activity in our body, digestion of specialty food
 or ek or Catalysts have proved very useful in industrial and chemical fields
 nitrogen kaa sthirikaran utprerit kriyaao kaa ek saadhaaran udhaaharan he
 For tree plants, the availability of permanent nitrogen is in the form of nitrate or ammonia
 nitrogen ke ye donon hi rup utprerako kii sahaayta se nirmit hote rahete hai
 During the Second World War, the fuel used in driving motor vehicles in almost all the world was prepared only with the help of catalysts
 utpreran dwaara petroleum se bahut se aise padaarth banaae jate the jo idhan ke rup main kaam main laae jate the
 In addition, catalytic actions have other importance, for example in the manufacture of synthetic rubber from butadiene and styrene, the manufacture of sulfuric acid, and in the manufacture of vegetable ghee by hydrogenation of vegetable oils in the presence of finely fragmented nickel, etc

 prayek yuddh main jo rajya ek duusare ke viruddh yuddh karte hai, ve "yuddhrat" rajya kahe jate hai
 States which do not fight from any side or do not participate in war are called neutral states
 at: tatasthta vah nippaksh athwa tatasth rahane kaa bhav he, jo yuddh main sammilit na honevaale tisare rajya yuddhrat donon paksh ke rajyon ke prati dhaaran karte hai or yuddhrat rajya is bhav ko apni manyata pradaan karte hai
 This sense of fairness or neutrality creates certain duties and certain rights between neutral states and warring states
 pracheen yug main tatasthta kaa prachlan nahin tha
 If a war broke out in those days, then the third states other than the two warring states had to choose which of these two sides to join
 ve ek ke mitra ban jate the or duusare ke shuthru
 In the medieval era, any state could declare that it could support either of the two warring parties
 17veen shatabdi main antarrashtriya vidhaan main tatasthta ko ek sanstha rup main sthaan praapt hua, yadhyapi us samay vah apni shaishvavastha main hi thi or apana vartmaan swaroop praapt kaane ke liye use dirdh kaal kii asavashyaktaa thi
 It was only in the 18th century that it became valid in both theoretical and practical terms that neutral states have a duty to be neutral or impartial and that warring states have a duty to respect the jurisdiction of neutral states
 san 1914 main pratham vishwayuddh prarambh hua
 At that time, many states announced that they would remain neutral
 is prakaar kii ghoshnaa karanevaale rajyon main sanyukt rajya america bhi tha
 But in October 1916, America also joined the war
 yuddh kaa ant hone par rashtrasang ke anubandhan ne tatasthta ke paramparaagat niyam kii samaapti kar di
 According to Section 10 of the said contract, the members of the League of Nations agreed to respect the territorial or territorial integrity and political independence of all member states
 sitambar, 1939 main dwitiya vishwayuddh chhidane par tatasthta kaa paranmparaagat niyam asthaayee rup se punarujjivit hua
 The United States and many other countries again announced that they would remain neutral in this war
 germany ne inamen se adhikansh rajyon kii tatasthta kaa ulanghan kiya
 Even during its neutrality, the United States made a borrower law to help the Allied Powers on the pretext that the security of these countries is necessary for the security of America itself
 yah prashn vivadagrast rahaa he ki jin dinon america probidhik rup main tatasth tha, un dino uskaa aisa aacharan kya uchit tha? After the end of the Second World War, when the United Nations Charter was approved in 1945, it abolished neutrality in a legal form
 us adhikaarptr main aise rajyon ke pruthak vaidhanik astitv kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 According to him, no state can remain voluntarily neutral in a war in respect of which the Security Council has found a particular state guilty of breach of peace or aggression and for which the United Nations has called upon its member nations to Take military action against the said state
 shaashvat tatasthta - shaashvat athwa chirsthayee tatasthta un rajyon kii tatasthta he, jo vishesh sandhiyon dwaara sweekaar kar lete he jaise, switzraland kii tatasthta
 Voluntary and Conventional Neutrality - If a state remains voluntarily neutral and does not make itself neutral by a treaty, its neutrality is voluntary neutrality
 duusari ore, yadi koi rajya aisi sandhi karata he ki yuddh chhidane par vah tatasth rahegaa, to uski tatasthta paramparaagat athwa vyavaharsiddh tatasthta kahi jaaygi
 Armed neutrality - If a warring state tries to use the jurisdiction of a neutral and that neutral state takes military action to protect its neutrality then military action to protect such neutrality, then such neutrality "armed neutrality" Will go somewhere dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay belgium, holland or switzraland kii tatasthta aisi hi sashastr tatasthta bhi
 Because, at that time these states kept presenting their armies for war
 sampurna or sampratibandh tatasthta- us rajya kii tatasthta "sapratibandh tatasthta" maani jaaygi, jo yon to tatasth rahata he, par pratyaksh athwa apratyaksh rup se do main se kisi ek yuddhrat paksh ko kisi prakaar kii sahaayta pradaan karata he
 On the other hand, neutrality of states that do not provide any kind of assistance to any warring state would be considered "total neutrality"
 1
 yuddhrat rajyon ke prati nishpakshta kaa bhav rakhana
 2
 To give its consent if a warring state exercises its right to punish them for violating the rules relating to blockade and movement of contraband goods by traders of neutral state
 1
 tatast rajyon ke nishpakshta sambandhi bhav ke anukool unke prati vyavhaar karnaa
 2 Not to suppress the trade-commerce or other relations of neutral states with respect to the enemy state
 yadi koi yuddhrat rajya kisi tatasth rajya kii tatasthta bhang karne kaa praytn karen, to vah tatasth rajya sadaiv hi apni raksha ke liye shastr uthaa saktaa he or uskaa yah balaprayog shatruta kaa kaary nahin mana jayega
 No neutral state should allow any warring state to take out its army, munitions or other logistics etc
 from within its territory
 parantu vah apane samudratati kshetra se yuddhrat rajyon ke yupoton ko vahaan se hokar nikal jane de saktaa he
 These warships can be allowed to pass through there
 in yupoton ko apane bandargahon se bahishkrut karne kii use aavashyaktaa nahin
 But in this way, the warships of the warring state should not do any such enemy act while going through the neutral states, which will cause harm to the warships of the enemy state
 yuddhrat rajyon ko tatasth rajyon ke samudri tat athwa unke apane bandargahon ko aadhaar banaakar shatrurajya ke viruddh akramanatmak karrwai nahin kerani chahie
 If the soldiers of the warring state attempt to pass through the jurisdiction of the neutral state, they should be forced to withdraw
 yadi ve tatasth rajya ke adhikarashetra main pravesh karne main safal ho jaaen to tatasth rajya ko chahie ki vah unke shastr rakhwakar unhen najarband kar le
 As far as the prisoners of war are concerned, on entering any neutral state, they go free because of their entry there
 parantu tatasth rajya kaa kartavya he ki vah unhen apni sena main jaakar pun: kaam karne kii anumati na pradaan karen
 Violations of neutrality are considered international crimes, then violating its rules, whether a neutral state commits against a warring state, whether a warring state commits against a neutral state
 in ulalanghanon kaa turant pratikaar hona chahie
 The party who has been tortured can demand compensation from the oppressed side
 peedit rajya atyaachaari rajya ke viruddh yuddh bhi kar saktaa he
 According to the prevailing meaning of the law of the present day regarding the right to force the property of a neutral state, any warring state is required to use or destroy the property of the neutral state if it is necessary for attack or protection
 Is empowered
 is adhikaar kaa prayog tatasth rajya ke adhikarashetra ke bheetar bhi kiya ja saktaa he, shatrupradesh ke antargat bhi kiya ja saktaa he or khule samudr ke bheetar bhi
 The warring state cannot compel a neutral state to do any service, ie if it voluntarily does any service, it is another matter
 yuddhrat rajya tatasth rajya kii sampatti kaa upyog kare athwa use nasht kar de to yuddhrat rajya ko uski kshatipurti kerani hogi
 The legend of Nal and Damayanti appears in the epic of India, the Mahabharata
 yudhisthir ko jue main apana sab-kuch ganvaa kar apane bhaaiyon ke saath vanvaas karnaa padaa
 At the same time, a sage told him the story of Nal and Damayanti
 nal nishadh desh ke raja the
 He was the son of Veersen
 nal bade vir the or sundar bhi
 He was proficient in armaments and horse-handling
 damyanti vidarbha naresh kii ekmaatr putree thi
 She was also very beautiful and talented
 nal uske saundarya kii prashansa sunakar usase prem karne laga
 The message of their love was delivered to Damayanti very efficiently by a swan
 or damyanti bhi apane us anjaan premi kii virah main jalane lagi
 This story has such an effective put of love and suffering that writers and poets, not only from India but also from abroad, could not live without being attracted by it
 bop latin main tathaa dean millman ne angreji kavita main anuwaad karke pashchim ko bhi is katha se bhalee bhaanti parichit karaayaa he
 a king named Bhishmak ruled the country of Vidarbha
 unki putree kaa naam damyanti thi
 Damayanti was as beautiful as Lakshmi
 unheen dinon nishadh desh main virasen ke putr nal rajya karte the
 He was very talented, truthful and a Brahmin devotee
 nishadh desh se jo log vidarbha desh main aate the, ve maharaj nal ke gunon kii prashansa karte the
 This praise also reached Damayanti's ears
 isi tarah vidarbha desh se aane vaale log rajkumaari ke rup or gunon kii charchaa maharaj nal ke samakshkarte
 As a result of this, Nal and Damayanti became attracted towards each other
 mahabharat main dharmraj yudhisthir ke aagrah karne par maharishi brihadshv ne nal-damyanti kii katha sunai- Dharmaraja! In the country of Nishad, there has been a king named Nal, son of Veersen
 ve bade gunavan, param sundar, satyawadee, jitendriya, sabake priy, vedagy evam brahmanbhakt the
 His army was very large
 
 He himself was very proficient in astrology
 ve vir, yoddha, udaar or prabal parakramee bhi the
 He also had some passion for playing gambling
 unheen dinon vidarbha desh main bhim naam ke ek raja rajya karte the
 He was also very virtuous and mighty like Nal
 unhone daman rishi ko prasann karke unke vardaan se chaar santaanen praapt kii thim—teen putr or ek kanya
 The names of the sons were Dum, Dant, and Daman
 putree kaa naam tha—damyanti
 Damayanti was as beautiful as Lakshmi
 uske netra vishaal the
 Even the beautiful girl was not seen in the gods and yakshas
 un dinon kitne hi log vidarbha desh se nishadh desh main aate or raja nal ke saamne damyanti ke rup or gun kaa bakhaan karte
 Even those who went from Nishad country to Vidarbha used to describe the form, quality and sacred character of King Nal in front of Damayanti
 is prakaar donon ke hriday main parsparik anuraag ankurit ho gaya
 One day King Nal saw some swans in the garden of his palace
 unhone ek hans ko pakad liya
 Hans said - 'if you leave me, we will go to Damayanti and describe your qualities in such a way that she will definitely take you
 ’ nal ne hansako chhod diya
 They were flown in unfertile country
 damyanti apane hanson ko dekhakar bahut prasann hui or hanson ko pakadaney ke liye unki ore daudane lagi
 The swan that Damayanti ran to catch, he would say, 'ari Damayanti! Nishad is a king named Nal in the country
 vah ashvinikumar ke samaan sundar he
 No one else is as beautiful as human beings
 vah maano murtiman kaamdev he
 If you become his wife, then both your birth and appearance become successful
 ham logon ne devtaa, gandharva, manushya, sarp or rakshason ko gum-ghumkar dekha he nal ke samaan kahin sundar purush dekhne main nahin aayaa
 Just as you are a gem in women, in the same way Nal is a Bhushan in men
 tum donon kii jodi bahut hi sundar hogi
 Damayanti said - "hansa! Say the same thing to you from the tap
 ’ hans ne nishadh desh main lautakar nal se damyanti kaa sandesh kah diya
 After hearing the fame of King Nal from the mouth of Damayanti Hans, he started loving them
 uski aasakti itani bad gayi ki vah raat-din unka hi dhyaan karti rahati
 The body became foggy and lean
 vah deen-si deekhne lagi
 The Sakhis, following Damayanti's heart rate, requested Vidarbharaj that 'your daughter is unwell
 ’ raja bhim ne apni putree ke sambandh main bada vichaar kiya
 In the end, he reached the decision that my daughter had become married, so she should do it herself
 unhone sab raajaaon ko swayamvar kaa nimantran-patr bhej diya or suchit kar diya ki raajaaon ko damyanti ke swayamvar main padharkar laabh uthaanaa chaiye or meraa manorath purna karnaa chaiye
 The patriarchs of the country began to arrive in Vidarbha country with the sound of elephants, horses and chariots, adorning the earth
 bhim ne sabake swaagat satkar kii samuchit vyavastha kii
 The Gods also got news of the Swayamvara of Damayanti through the Devarshi Narada and the mountain
 indra aadi sabhi lokapal bhi apni mandali or vaahanon sahit vidarbha desh ke liye ravaanaa hue
 Raja Nal's mind was already enamored on Damayanti
 unhone bhi damyanti ke swayamvar main sammilit hone ke liye vidarbha desh kii yatra kii
 While descending from heaven, the gods saw that beautiful tapes like Kamadev were going to the Swayamvara of Damayanti
 nal kii surya ke samaan kaanti or lokottar rup-sampatti se devtaa bhi chakit ho gayi
 He recognized that these are the taps
 unhone apane vimaanon ko akaash main khadaa kar diya or neeche utarkar nal se kaha—‘rajendra nal ! aap bade satyavrati hai
 You become a messenger to help us
 ’ nal ne pratigya kar lee or kaha ki ‘karunga’
 Then he asked, 'who are you and what is your job as a messenger?' Indra said - 'we are gods
 main indra hoon or ye agni, varun or yama hai
 We have come here for Damanti
 devataaon ne nal se kaha ki aap hamaare doot banakar damyanti ke paas jaaiye or kahie ki indra, varun, agni or yamadewataa tumhaare paas aakar tumse vivaah karnaa chaahate hai
 Whichever of these gods you accept as husband
 ’ nal ne donon haath jodakar kaha ki ‘devraj’ ! vahaan aap logon ke or mere jane kaa ek hi prayojan he
 That is why it is not appropriate that you send me as an angel
 jisaki kisi stri ko patni ke rup main paane kii ichha ho chuki ho, vah bhala, usko kaise chhod saktaa he or uske paas jaakar aisi baat kah hi kaise saktaa he ? aap log kripaya is vishay main mujhe kshamaa kijiye There was a Swayamvar of Damayanti in which not only the king of the earth, but also the gods came as a tap
 swayamvar main ek saath kai nal khadey the
 Everyone was upset about who the real tap would be
 lekin damyanti jaraa bhi vichlit nahin hui
 He recognized the real tap by eye
 saare devataaon ne bhi unka abhivadan kiya
 In this way, Damayanti recognized her real life and chose her life partner
 nav-dampatti ko devataaon kaa aashirwad praapt hua
 Damayanti nishad-naresh became the queen of King Nal
 donon bade sukh se samay bitaane lage
 Damyanti was a shiromani among husbandmen
 abhimaan to use kabhi chhu bhi na saktaa tha
 In time, a son and a girl were born from Damyanti's womb
 donon bachche mata-pita ke anuroop hi sundar rup or gunse sampann the
 Time does not always remain the same, the cycle of sorrow and happiness keeps going on
 vaise to maharaj nal gunavan, dharmatma tathaa punyashlok the, kintu unamem ek dosha tha —jue kaa vyasan
 One of Nal's brothers was named Pushkar
 vah nal se alag rahata tha
 He invited them for gambling
 khel armbh hua
 Luck was unfavorable
 nal haarane lage, sona, chaandi, rath, rajpaat sab haath se nikal gaya
 Knowing the unfavorable time, Queen Damayanti sent her two children to Kundinpur, the capital of Vidarbha country
 idhar nal jue main apana sarvasv haar gayi
 He removed all the clothes of his body
 keval ek vastra pahanakar nagar se baahar nikle
 Damayanti also followed her husband in just one sari
 ek din raja nal ne sone ke pankh vaale kuch pakshi dekhe
 King Nal thought, if these are captured, some money can be earned by selling them for sustenance
 aisa vichaarkar unhone apane pahanane kaa vastra kholkar pakshiyon par phenkaa
 Birds flew with the clothes
 ab raja nal ke paas tan dhakne ke liye bhi koi vastra na rah gaya
 Nal was more disturbed by Damayanti's misery than he was
 ek din donon jangal main ek vriksh ke neeche ek hi vastra se tan chipaaye pade the
 Damayanti fell asleep due to exhaustion
 raja nal ne sochaa, damyanti ko mere kaaran bada dukh sahan karnaa pad rahaa he
 If i leave it here at this stage, it will somehow reach its father
 yah vichaarkar unhone talwaar se uski aadhi sari ko kaat liya or usee se apana tan dhakkar tathaa damyanti ko usee avasthaa main chhod kar ve chal diye
 When Damyanti fell asleep, poor lady found herself alone and Karun started mourning
 bhukh or pyaas se vyakul hokar vah achaanak ajgar ke paas chali gayi or ajgar use nigalane laga
 Hearing Damyanti's scream, a hunter saved him from being a dragon
 kintu vyaadh swabhaav se dusht tha
 He was fascinated by the beauty of Damayanti and wanted to make him a victim of his job
 damyanti use shaap dete hue boli—‘yadi maine apane pati raja nal ko chhodkar kisi anya purush kaa kabhi chintan na kiya ho to is paapi vyaadh ke jivan kaa abhi ant ho jaay
 Hunter's death was reached as soon as Damayanti was fulfilled
 daivayog se bhatakate hue damyanti ek din chedinaresh subahu ke paas or uske baad apane pita ke paas pahunch gayi
 Finally, one day Maharaj Nal's sorrows also came to an end with the influence of the Satyatta of Damayanti
 donon kaa punarmilan hua or raja nal ko unka rajya bhi waapas mil gaya
 Nal and Damayanti had two twin sons Namah and Dal
