 But the most popular word in literary criticism is essay
 ise angreji ke compozishan or esse ke arth main grahan kiya jaataa he
 According to Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, there is also literature of essays in Sanskrit
 pracheen sanskrit sahitya ke un nibandhon main dharamshastreey siddhanton kii taarkik vyakhya kii jaati thi
 They were not characterized by personality
 kintu vartmaan kaal ke niabandh sanskrit ke nibandhon se thik ulate hai
 Among them, the quality of personality or individuality is universal

 The mode of essay is related to this sense of history
 yahi kaaran he ki niabandh kii pradhan visheshta vyaktitv kaa prakaashan he
 The best definition of an essay is- is paribhaasha main ativyapti dosha he
 But the form of essay is so independent of other forms of literature that it is very difficult to define it accurately
 sari duniya kii bhashaaon main niabandh ko sahitya kii srujanaatmak vidha ke rup main manyata aadhunik yug main hi mili he
 In the modern era itself, the door of freedom from medieval religious, social conventions has been seen
 is mukti se niabandh kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 According to Hazariprasad Dwivedi- is prakaar niabandh main nibandhkaar kii svachhndatha kaa vishesh mahatva he
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla wrote: iskaa taatpary yah he ki niabandh main kinhin aise thos rachana-niyamon or tatwon kaa nirdesh nahin diya ja saktaa jinka paalan karnaa nibandhkaar ke liye aavashyak he
 It is said that the essay is an artwork whose rules are invented by the author
 niabandh main sahaj, saral or aadambarhin dhang se vyaktitv kii abhivyakti hoti he
 According to 'hindi Sahitya Kosh': is prakaar niabandh ke do vishesh gun hai- The essayist is not obliged to follow any such instructions and rules as to how the beginning of an essay, what should be in the middle and how to end
 lekin iskaa arth yah nahin he ki niabandh ek uchhrunkhal rachana he or nibandhkaar ek uchhrunkhal vyakti
 The essayist organizes the publication and composition of his personality according to the possibilities of his inspiration and subject matter
 isi kaaran niabandh main style kaa vishesh mahatva he
 In the modern era of Hindi literature, the tradition of writing essays with Bharatendu and his colleagues begins
 niabandh hi nahin, gadhy kii kai vidhaon kaa prachlan bharatendu se hota he
 This is proof that prose and its genres are more compatible with the independent personality of modern man

 jin kaarnon se sharir ke vibhinn angon kii samyavastha, yaa swastheavastha, nasht hokar unamem vikrutiyaan utpann hoti hai, unako hetukikaarak or unke shaastra ko hetuvigyaan kehete hai
 These reasons are many
 inhen nimnlikhit bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he : The pathogen causing these pathologies is called pathogenesis
 rogakaarak hetuon se sharir ke vibhinn angon main jo aswasth avasthaaen yaa sthityantar utpann hote hai, unako vikrutiyaan kehete hai tathaa in vikrutiyon se yukt dhaatu ang yaa aashay ke vivaran ko vikrut sharir tathaa in vikrutiyon ke shaastra ko vikruti vigyaan yaa pathalogy kehete hai
 The main purpose of pathology is to show the working sense of the various pathologies that occur in different organs from different pathogens
 un vikrutiyon ke sthool or sookshm swaroopon kaa vivaran dena or unke aadhaar par vividh vyaadhiyon se utpann honevaale lakshanon kaa spashtikaran dena hi vikrutivigyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy he
 This objective cannot be proved without combining the complete history of dead persons with various diseases, post-mortem examination, of the deformities found within the various organs of their body
 16 veen - 17 veen shatabdi main paashchaatya deshon main vikruti vigyaan ke liye shavpareekshan kaa prarambh kiya gaya
 Morgagni researched hundreds of postmortemings conducted before him in 1761, seven hundred of them were published in three parts of a large collection of chronicles
 rogiyon ke vibhinn angon main paae gaye chihnon or lakshanon kaa sambandh unke shavon ke bheetar pai gai rachanatmk vikrutiyon ke saath kahan tak baithta he isaki charchaa is grath main kii gai he
 It was only after this that pathology gained independent existence

 main prakashit kiya
 This treatise revolutionized the imagination of the relation between the nature of diseases and which tools should be used for their practice and pathology, which was earlier a small subject under Roganidan, Made a great foundation for diagnosis
 sharir ke angon main honevaali vikrutiyaan avyakt hote hue bhi pratikriya, sujan, jirnoddhar, vruddhi main baadha, apjanan, arbud ityadi kuch ini-gini saamaanya prakaar kii hoti he
 When the nature of these deformations is easily perceptible within the body, then it is called macro deformity and when there is a deformity of the subtle form, when the microscope instrument is needed to see these deformations then it is called micro deformation
 vikrutiyon main sharir ke vibhinn angon kii vaishamyavastha par tathaa unke rachanaatmak or swarupatmak parivartanon par jor diya jaataa he or rogon main unke kaaryaatmak parivartanon par jor diya jaataa he
 In the summary, malformations are related to different organs and the disease is mostly related to symptoms
 sharir main vikrutiyon ke swaroop main rog bahut pehle se rahata he
 Only by being very subtle does the sensory intelligence become less and more intelligent
 jab sharirgat sampurna vikrutiyon kaa tathaa unke hetuon kaa varnan uparyukt sarsaadhaaran prakaaron ke anusaar kiya jaataa he, to usko saamaanya vikrutivigyaan kehete hai or jab sharir ke prayek ang, aashay yaa santhaan kaa varnan usamen honevaali uparyukt prakaar kii vikrutiyon ke saath swatantra rup se kiya jaataa he, tab usko vishesh vikrutivigyaan kehete hai
 The patient's pathology is studied by clinical pathology from various examinations inside the laboratory
 saamaanya vikrutivigyaan ko nimnlikhit adhyyon main baanta gaya he

 The following are the types of tissue: yah bhi ootkavishesh par honevaali kriya he
 When a tissue is called degeneration, it must be understood to mean a particular type of change in the tissue, such as saying fat degeneration is the presence of fat in a particular tissue, such is the perception, naming accordingly, such as the heart Deterioration, muscular degeneration, mechanical degeneration etc
 duusare shabd main utakon ke paushtik aahaar kii kami se koshika kii rasinic kriya main jab parivartan aa jaataa he, to use apakarshan kehete hai
 In this, the cell dies completely and a new type of chemical substance is produced from its protoplasm

 When there is a type of rot in the tissue due to lack of blood, it is called koth
 yah do prakaar kaa hota he shushk koth tathaa ardra 
 Dry koth - When the blood reaches an organ through an artery of one part, dry koth is produced
 ardra kosh - isamen shiraaon dwaara ang vishesh se rakt kaa hriday kii ore dhoya janaa purnataya ruk jaataa he
 There is a flow of blood at that place, but there is no drain
 uparyukt do prakaar ke koth ke atirikt or prakaar ke bhi koth hote hai, jaise, ant: shaalyik koth, sankrami koth, vaatikoth, madhumeh janit koth, vardhaky koth tathaa renon kaa rog

 yah sharir kii aisi vishisht avasthaa he, jisamen shaareerik utak kii navvruddhi hoti he
 Generally, tumors are of two types: mridu arbud - ye praghatak isiilie kahe jate hai ki inke dwaara jivan ko kisi prakaar kii kshati nahin pahunchati

 unki rachana utak se bhinn hoti he tathaa unki vruddhi bahut hi drut veg se hoti he
 They circulate in the body quickly and induce healthy ingredients inside
 is aantarik prasaaran kii kriya ko metastasis kehete hai
 For this reason, they are also very deadly and because of this they are called deadly, wicked, or few tumors
 manushya sharir main jab koi rogotpadak jeevanuon kaa akraman hota he, to sharir ke andar prakruti unka ghortam pratirodh karti he or isi yuddh main sharir ke bali kosh un bahari jeevanuon kaa bal nasht karke sharir ko rog se bachaa lete hai
 This curative power produced from inside the body is called immunity
 pratiraksha do prakaar kii hoti he : Natural immunity - The natural force that is produced inside the body in resistance to a disease is called natural immunity
 arjeet pratiraksha - kisi vyakti main kisi vishesh rog ke pratirodh kii shakti yadi nahin he or peeche se swayan yaa kisi anya upayon dwaara usamen us rog ke pratirodh kii shakti paidaa kar di jaae, to use arjeet pratiraksha kah sakate hai
 For example, some germs that produce cholera, smallpox, pearl, tetanus, etc
 are small that can cause disease once they enter the body, but produce small amounts of immunity against disease
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki ek vish adhik maatra main hone se sharir main vyaadhi utpann karata he, kintu vahi vish atyalp maatra main rahane se pratiraksha paidaa karata he

 Spin bowling is a technique used for bowling in the game of cricket
 is takanic ke mahiron ko spin gendbaaj yaa spinner kaha jaataa he
 The main purpose of spin bowling is to throw the ball with a fast spin, so that the ball changes direction after the pitch is eaten on the pitch and the batsman has difficulty playing it
 is vidha main gend kii gati mahatvapurn nahin he, tathaa tej gendbaaji ke mukaable main yah kaaphi kam hoti he
 Generally the speed of the spin ball is 70- 90 km p

 The inexperienced batsmen can get quite confused with the spin, direction and rotation gained by a spin bowler
 spin gendbaajon ko aam taur par ek puraani gend ke saath gendbaaji karne kaa kaary diya jaataa he
 The new ball is suited for fast bowling and the old worn ball for spin bowling
 puraani ghisi hui gend pich ko behatar pakad kar adhik spin praapt karti he
 The spinners become more effective in the later part of the match due to the dryness and cracks of the pitch
 is samay spinner ko pich adhik madad karti he or gend behatar spin hoti he
 The finger spin and wrist spin bowlers both confuse and dismiss the batsman using different angles of spin
 in bhinn vidhaon main aapas main kai pratyaksh samakaksh he, lekin har vidha main naam alag ho saktaa he
 In recent years the art of spin bowling has been dominated by the bowlers of the Indian subcontinent
 iske liye praathmik kaaran yah he ki up mahadweep main pich spin gendbaajon ko adhik madad pradaan karti he
 The sooner the pitch breaks, the quicker the spinner becomes effective
 austrailia or dakshin africa ke wicket aamtaur par bahut sakht or oochaal vaale hai jahaan tej gendbaaj ko adhik madad milti he
 They do not break much during the entire duration of the test match
 But the pitches in the subcontinent are not as strict
 unamem aam taur par bandhe rakhane ke liye adhik ghaas nahin hoti he
 Therefore, the pitches here break quickly and are conducive to spin

 skinner ne aage chalakar operent condishning or maukhik vyavhaar ko cover karne ke liye is model ko vistaarit kiya
 According to his view of a basic human motivation as being sexually driven, Sigmund Freud developed a psychoanalytic theory of human development beyond infancy and divided it into five stages
 prayek charan sharir ke vasanotejak kshetra yaa kisi vishesh kshetra ke bheetar kamechha kii santushti ke aasapaas kendrit tha
 He also argued that as humans develop, they become stable on different and specific objects through their stages of development
 prayek charan main matbhinnata he jise bachche ke vikaas ko sakasham banane ke liye hal karnaa jaruri he
 The use of the theory of dynamic systems as a framework for the idea of evolution began in the early 1990s and is still in use in the current century
 gatyaatmak pranali siddhant arekhiy sambandhon or ek charan parivartan ke rup main phir se sangathit hone kii ek pranali kii kshamta par jor detaa he jisaki prakruti manch kii tarah hoti he
 Another useful concept for evolutionists is the position of attractor; This stage apparently helps to determine unrelated behaviors as well as related behaviors
 gatyaatmak pranali siddhant ko motor vikaas ke adhyayan main bade paimaane par lagu kiya jaataa he; lagaav pranaaliyon ke bare main boulbi ke kuch drushtikonon ke saath bhi is siddhant kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 Dynamic systems theory also relates to the concept of the behavioral process, which is a reciprocal interaction process in which children and parents influence each other simultaneously leading to developmental changes in both over time
 kor nolej persepective bachche ke vikaas main ek vikasmoolak siddhant he jo yah prastaav detaa he ki "shishuon ke jivan kii shuruyaat sahaj or vishesh prayojan vaali gyaan pranaaliyon ke saath hoti he jise soch ke kor domen ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he"
 soch ke paanch kor domen hai jinamein se prayek astitv raksha ke liye bahut jaruri he jo ek saath aarambhik anubhuti ke pramukh pahaluon ke vikaas ke liye hamen taiyaar karte hai; ve hai: shaareerik, sankhyatmak, bhashaai, manovaigyanik or jaivik
 Although identifying developmental goals is an interesting task for researchers and child carers, many aspects of developmental change are persistent and do not reflect the visible milestones of change
 satat vikasaatmak parivartanon, jaise kad main vruddhi, main vayask visheshtaon kii taraf kaaphi kramik or purvanumey pragati shaamil hoti he
 However, when developmental change is discrete, researchers can identify not only the milestones of development but also the associated age periods often called stages
 ek charan aksar ek gyaat kalanukramik aayu seemaa se judi hui ek samyavadhi he jis dauraan koi vyavhaar yaa shaareerik visheshta gunatmak rup se anya charnon se alag hoti he
 When an age period is referred to as a phase, the term does not only mean a qualitative difference but it also means a predictable sequence of developmental events such as specific behavioral or physiological before and after each stage
 There are other specific periods associated with qualities
 vikaas ke charan ek saath ho sakate hai yaa vikaas ke anya vishisht pahaluon se jude ho sakate hai jaise bolnaa yaa chalanaa
 yahan tak ki ek vishesh vikasaatmak kshetra main bhi kisi charan main sankraman kaa matlab yah nahin ho saktaa he ki pichhlaa charan puri tarah se samaapt ho gaya he
 For example, in Erickson's discussion of stages of personality, this theorist suggests that life is spent working afresh on issues that were originally characteristic of the childhood phase
 isi tarah, sangyanatmak vikaas ke siddhantkaar piyajet ne un paristhitiyon kaa varnan kiya jinamein bachche paripakv soch-vichaar kaushal ke istemaal se ek prakaar kii samasya kaa samaadhaan kar sakate hai lekin ve kam parichit samasyaon ke liye ise puraa nahin kar sakate hai; is ghatana ko unhone kshaitij dicales naam diya
 Although developmental change goes on with chronological age, age itself does not contribute to development
 vikasaatmak parivartanon kii buniyadi kriyavidhi yaa kaaran, anuvanshik or paryaavarniya kaarak hote hai
 Genetic factors are responsible for cellular changes such as overall development, changes in the proportion of parts of the body and brain, and maturation of aspects of function such as vision and dietary needs
 kyonki genes ko "band" or "chaalu" kiya ja saktaa he isliye samay samay par vyakti kii praarambhik ginotip ke kaary main parivartan ho saktaa he jisase aage chalakar vikasaatmak parivartan main teji aa sakati he
 Environmental factors affecting development may include diet and disease risk as well as social, emotional, and cognitive experiences
 haalaanki, paryaavarniya karkon kii pariksha se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki yuva manushya paryaavarniya anubhavon kii ek kaaphi vyapak seemaa main bhi jivit rah sakate hai
 Rather than acting as independent mechanisms, genetic and environmental factors often influence each other, leading to developmental change
 bachche ke vikaas ke kuch pahalu unki namaneeyata ke liye yaa us had tak ullekhneey hai jis had tak vikaas kii disha kaa maargdarshan paryaavarniya karkon dwaara kiya jaataa he or saath hi saath anuvanshik karkon dwaara shuru kiya jaataa he
 For example, it appears that the development of allergic reactions is relatively due to exposure to some environmental factors of early life, and protecting against early exposure makes the child less likely to have a variable allergic reaction
 
 jab vikaas ke kisi pahalu par praarambhik anubhav kaa bahut zyada asar padataa he to kaha jaataa he ki isamen bahut zyada namaneeyata dikhaai detii he; jab anuvanshik swabhaav vikaas kaa praathmik kaarak hota he to kaha jaataa he ki namaneeyata kam he
 Plasticity may include endogenous factors such as hormones as well as exogenous factors such as guidance of infection
 vikaas ke paryaavarniya maargdarshan ke ek kism kaa varnan anubhav par nirbhar namaneeyata ke rup main kiya jaataa he jisamen paryaavaran se seekhney ke parinamswaroop vyavhaar main badlaav aata he
 Thus plasticity can occur over a lifetime and may involve a variety of behaviors, including some emotional reactions
 ek duusare prakaar kii namaneeyata, anubhav ashanvit namaneeyata main vikaas kii simit samvedansheel avadhiyon ke dauraan vishisht anubhavon kaa kaaphi prabhaav shaamil hota he
 For example, the coordinated use of two eyes and the experience of a single three-dimensional image instead of two-dimensional images produced by light in each eye depends on experiences with vision during the second half of the first year of life
 anubhav-ashanvit namaneeyata, anuvanshik karkon ke parinamswaroop ishtatam parinaamon ko praapt na kar paane vaale vikaas sambandhi pahaluon ko thik karne kaa kaam karti he
 In addition to the existence of plasticity in certain aspects of development, genetic-environmental correlations may function in many ways in determining the mature characteristics of an individual
 anuvanshik-paryaavarniya sahasambandh aisi paristhitiyaan hai jinamein anuvanshik karkon se kaaphi had tak kuch anubhav milane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 For example, in passive genetic-environmental correlation, a child is likely to experience a particular environment because his or her parents' genetic nature may lead them to choose or create such an environment
 vicharottejak anuvanshik-paryaavarniya sahasambandh main bachche kii anuvanshik rup se viksit visheshtaon kii vajah se duusare logon ko kuch khaas tareekon se jawaab dena padataa he jisase unhen ek aisa alag maahaul miltaa he jo ki anuvanshik rup se alag bachche ko mil saktaa ho; udhaaharan ke taur par, down syndrome se grast bachche kaa ilaaj ek gaiyr-down syndrome grast bachche kii tulana main adhik surakshatmak rup se or kam chunauteepurn dhang se kiya ja saktaa he
 Finally, an active genetic – environmental correlation is a relationship in which the child chooses experiences that in turn influence them; For example, a strong active child may choose after-school sports experiences that build enhanced athletic skills but may hinder music education
 inamen se sabhi maamalon main yah pataa karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he ki bachche kii visheshtaon kaa nirmaan anuvanshik karkon yaa anubhavon yaa donon ke sanyog se hua tha
 Systematic inquiry about developmental events is needed to establish a useful understanding of the child's development
 vikaas ke vibhinn pahaluon main parivartan kii vibhinn paddatiyaan or kaaran shaamil hai, isliye bachche ke vikaas ko sankshep main prastut karne kaa koi saral tarika nahin he
 Nevertheless, answering a few questions about each topic can provide comparable information about various aspects of developmental change
 waters evam unke sahyogiyon ne is uddeshy se nimnlikhit sawaalon kaa suzav diya he
 Several methods can be used in empirical research to answer these questions
 shuru main, pehle varsh main parivarti pratikriyaaon main parivartan jaise vikasaatmak parivartan ke kisi pahalu ke vistrut varnan evam paribhaasha ko viksit karne ke liye prakritik paristhitiyon main paryvekshaniya shodh kii jarurat pad sakati he
 This type of work can be followed by some kind of development such as correlative studies, collecting information about chronological age, and vocabulary development; Correlative statistics can be used to describe the change
 is tarah ke adhyayan alag alag umr main bacchon kii visheshtaon kii jaanch karte hai
 These methods may include longitudinal studies in which a group of children is re-examined multiple times when they are older, or cross-sectional studies may include groups of children of different ages at once
 Are examined and compared with one another, or a combination of these methods may be involved
 bachche ke vikaas se sambandhit kuch adhyayanon main jaruri taur par kisi gaiyr-yadrichhik dizin main bacchon ke alag-alag samoohon kii visheshtaon kii tulana karke anubhav yaa anuvanshikta ke prabhaavon kii jaanch kii jaati he
 In other studies, randomized designs can be used to compare outcomes for groups of children who receive different interventions or educational treatments
 milastons vishisht shaareerik or maansik kshamtaaon main hone vaale parivartan hai jo ek vikasaatmak avadhi ke ant or duusari vikasaatmak avadhi ke armbh ko chihnit karte hai
 For phase theories, phase shifts are indicated by milestones
 kai vikaas kaaryon kii purnataa ke adhyayanon ne vikasaatmak milastons ke saath jude vishisht kalanukramik aayu ko sthapit kiya he
 However, there is considerable difference in the attainment of milestones even among children with developmental cycles within the normal range
 kuch milastons duusare se adhik parivartaneey hote hai; udhaaharan ke liye, grahanshil bhaashan sanketakon se saamaanya rup se sunne vaale bacchon main kaaphi bhinnata kaa pataa chalata he lekin arthpurna bhaashan milastons kaaphi parivartaneey ho sakate hai
 a common concern related to the development of the child is developmental delay including delay in an age-specific capacity for significant developmental milestones
 vikasaatmak deree kii rokthaam or usamen aarambhik hastkshep bachche ke vikaas ke adhyayan kaa mahatvapurn vishay he
 Developmental delay should be identified by comparing it with the specific variability of a milestone, not with respect to the mean age at achievement
 milastone kaa ek udhaaharan aankh or haath kaa samanvay ho saktaa he jisamen ek samanvit tareeke se vastuon main pherbadal karne se sambandhit bachche kii badhati kshamta shaamil he
 Increasing knowledge of age-specific milestones makes it easier for parents and others to monitor proper development
 bachche kaa vikaas kaa mudda koi ekaaki vishay nahin he balki yah kuch had tak vyakti ke vibhinn pahaluon ke liye alag dhang se pragati karata he
 Here the development of many physical and mental characteristics is described
 xxrep 4 = kya viksit hota he?janm ke baad 15 se 20 varsh kii aayu tak kad or vajan ke kshetra main shaareerik vikaas hota he; sahi samay par janm lene ke samay ke ausat vajan 3
5 kilo or ausat lambaai 50 semi se badhate-badhate vyakti apane purna vayask aakaar tak pahunchataa he
 As the height and weight increases, the physical proportions of the person also change, the head of the newborn is relatively large and the torso and the rest of the limbs are small which, when they are adults, have relatively small head and long torso and limbs
 Is transformed
 shaareerik vikaas kii gati janm ke baad ke maheenon main tej hoti he or uske baad dhimi pad jaati he isliye janm ke samay kaa vajan pehle chaar maheenon main doguna or 12 maheene kii umr main tiguna ho jaataa he lekin 24 maheene tak chauguna nahin hota he
 Growth continues at a slow pace until just before puberty, after which the pace of development becomes quite rapid
 sharir ke sabhi hisson main hone vaali vruddhi kii dar or samay main ekarupata nahin hoti he
 The head size at birth is already roughly the size of an adult's head, but the lower body is much smaller than the adult's lower parts
 uske baad vikaas ke kram main sir dhire-dhire chota hota jaataa he or dhad or baaki angon main teji se vikaas hone lagata he
 Genetic factors have a major role in determining the rate of growth and in particular the changes in the proportional feature of early human development
 haalaanki anuvanshik karkon kii vajah se keval tabhi adhiktam vruddhi ho sakati he jab paryaavarniya paristhitiyaan anukool hon
 kharaab poshan or aksar chot or beemaari kii vajah se vyakti kaa vayask kad ghat saktaa he lekin behtareen maahaul kii vajah se kad main bahut zyada vruddhi nahin ho sakati he jitna ki anuvanshikta se nirdhaarit hota ho
 Population differences in growth are largely related to adult stature
 vayask avasthaa main kaaphi lambey rahane vaale jatigat samoohon ke bachche chote vayask kad vaale samoohon kii tulana main janm ke samay or bachapan ke dauraan bhi lambey hote hai
 Males are also somewhat taller, although this is more pronounced in caste groups with strong sexual dimorphism in the adult stage
 visheshtya kuposhan ke shikaar log bhi jivan bhar chote yaa nate rahete hai
 However, the population difference in growth rate and pattern is not large, except that poor environmental conditions can cause delays in puberty and associated growth rates
 spasht rup se ladakon or ladakiyon ke yauvan kii alag-alag aayu kaa matlab he ki 11 yaa 12 saal ke ladke or ladkiyaan paripakvata ke maamle main kaaphi alag-alag str par hote hai or shaareerik aakaar ke maamle main saamaanya yon antar ke vipareet str par ho sakate hai
 In childhood, there is a considerable individual difference in weight and weight
 inamen se kuch antaron kii vajah paariwarik anuvanshik kaarak or anya antaron kii vajah paryaavarniya kaarak hai lekin vikaas ke kram main kahin-kahin prajnan paripakvata main vyaktigat antaron kaa un par bahut zyada prabhaav padataa he
 Changes in physical activity abilities during childhood are largely influenced by the variable activity patterns of the young infant in the highly skilled voluntary movement characteristic of childhood and adolescence
 motor vikaas kii gati praarambhik jivan main tej hoti he kyonki navjaat shishu kii parivarti gatividhiyon main se kai pehle saal ke bheetar badal jaati hai yaa gaayab ho jaati hai or baad main yah gati dhimi pad jaati he
 Like physical growth, motor development also predicts predictive methods of cephalocodal and proximodistal development, and controls the movements of the head and more central regions before the lower body or hands and feet
 gatividhi ke prakaaron kaa vikaas charan jaise kramon main hota he; udhaaharan ke liye, 6 se 8 maheenon kii harakat main donon haathon or donon pairon par rengna or uske baad khadey honi kii koshish karnaa, kisi chiz ko pakadte samay uske "chakkar" lagaana, kisi vayask kaa haath pakadakar chalanaa or ant main swatantra rup se chalanaa shaamil he
 Older children continue this sequence by walking side-by-side or backward, walking or running fast, jumping, skipping with one foot and walking with the other foot and finally skipping
 madhya bachapan or kishoravastha tak ek purvanumey kram ke bajaay anudesh yaa paryvekshan ke madhyam se nae motor kaushalon kii prapti hoti he
 The mechanisms or processes involved in motor development involve certain genetic components that determine the physical size of body parts at a specified age, as well as aspects of muscle and bone strength
 poshan or vyaayaam bhi takat kaa nirdhaaran karte hai or isliye ye aasaani or sateekta kaa bhi nirdhaaran hota he jiske saath sharir ke hisse ko hilaayaa-dulaayaa ja saktaa he
 Opportunities for movement help establish the ability to bend and stretch the body parts, both of which are essential for good motor ability
 abhyaas or seekhney ke parinamswaroop kushal svaichhik gatividhiyon kaa vikaas hota he
 The motor capacity of a normal person is normal and depends to some extent on the weight and build of the child
 haalaanki shishav kaal ke baad saamaanya vyaktigat antaron par abhyaas, paryvekshan or vishisht gatividhiyon ke anudesh kaa bahut zyada asar padataa he
 Abnormal motor development can be a sign of problems or developmental delays such as autism or cerebral palsy
 motor vikaas ke kshetra main kuch jansankhya antar bhi dekhne ko milte hai jinke tahat ladakiyon ko choti mansapeshiyon ke istemaal se kuch laabh miltaa he jinamein hothon or jeebh se dhvaniyon kaa uccharan bhi shaamil he
 There have been reports of racial differences in the variable activities of newborns, which suggests that some biological factors are also active
 saanskrithik antar motor kaushal ko seekhney main protsaahan de sakate hai jaise swatchta prayojanon ke liye keval baayein haath kaa istemaal karnaa or anya sabhi kaaryon ke liye daayen haath kaa istemaal karnaa jisase jansankhya antar kaa nirmaan hota he
 Cultural factors are also seen to be functional in practice voluntary activities such as using the foot to move the football forward or the hand to move the basketball forward
 chote bacchon main seekhney, yaad rakhane or jaankaree kaa pratik banane or samasyaon ko hal karne kii kshamta saamaanya str par hoti he jo sangyanatmak kaary kar sakate hai jaise chetan or achetan praaniyon main bhedbhaav karnaa yaa kam sankhya vaali vastuon kii pahchaan karnaa
 In childhood, the speed of learning and processing information increases, memory also increases, and the use of signal use and summarization develops until adolescence is almost reached the adult level
 sangyanatmak vikaas main anuvanshik or anya jaivik kriyavidhi hoti hai jaise ki maansik mandatha ke kai anuvanshik karkon main dekha gaya he
 However, despite assuming that brain functions are the cause of cognitive events, it is not possible to measure specific brain changes and show that they are the ones that cause cognitive changes
 anubhuti ke kshetra main hone vaali vikasaatmak unnatiyon kaa sambandh anubhav or shikshan se bhi hota he or yah mukhya rup se ucch stareey kshamtaaon kaa maamla he jaise sankshepan jo kaaphi had tak aupchaarik shiksha par nirbhar karata he
 Common individual differences are seen in those ages at which specific cognitive abilities are attained, but children's schooling in industrialized countries is based on the assumption that these differences are not very large
 sangyanatmak vikaas main asaamaanya vilamb se un samskritiyon ke bacchon ke liye samasyaayein paidaa ho sakati hai jo kaam ke liye or swatantra jeevanyaapan ke liye unnat sangyanatmak kaushalon kii maang karte hai
 There are very few population differences in the area of cognitive development
 ladakon or ladakiyon ke kaushal or variyataon main kuch antar dekhne ko miltaa he lekin samoohon main bahut kuch ek saath hota he
 It seems that the differences in cognitive achievement of different ethnic groups are the result of cultural or other environmental factors
 navjaat shishuon ko sambhawatah na to dar kaa anubhav nahin hota he or na hi ve kisi vyakti vishesh ke saath sampark sthapit karne ko variyata dete hai
 They change very rapidly for about 8 to 12 months and become fearful of known threats; They also start giving preference to acquaintances and when they are separated from them or in front of a stranger, they start feeling anxious and sad
 sahanubhuti or saamaajik niyamon ko samajhane kii kshamta purvaskuli avadhi main shuru ho jaati he or vayask kaal main inkaa vikaas jari rahata he
 Friendships with older children in middle childhood and feelings of sexuality in adolescence and romantic love begin
 balykaal or aarambhik prischuli avadhi or kishoravastha ke dauraan bahut zyada krodh kaa bhav rahata he
 Some aspects of social emotional development, such as empathy, develop slowly but other aspects, such as fear, may involve a relatively abrupt restructuring of the child's experience of emotion
 yon or romantic bhaawanaaon kaa vikaas shaareerik paripakvata ke sambandh main hota he
 Genetic factors appear to control some socio-emotional developments such as fear of predation and attachment to familiar people
 anubhav is baat ko nirdhaarit karne main ek mukhya bhoomika nibhaataa he ki koun-koun se log parichit hai, kin-kin saamaajik niyamon kaa paalan kiya jaataa he or kis tarah krodh vyakt kiya jaataa he
 It is not common for individual differences to occur in the course of socio-emotional development, but there can be a huge difference in the intensity or expressiveness of emotions from a normal child to another
 vibhinn prakaar kii pratikriyaatmakataaon kii vyaktigat pravritiyaan shaayad swaabhaavik hoti hai or unhen swabhaavgat antar ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 The abnormal development of social emotional characteristics may be slightly different or may be so severe that it may indicate mental illness
 swabhaavgat lakshanon ko jivan kaal ke dauraan sthir or tikaoo mana jaataa he
 Hopefully, children who are active and angry in infancy can be as active and angry as older children, adolescents, and adults
 bade bacchon main jansankhya antar maujuud ho saktaa he, udhaaharan ke taur par yadi unhone yah siikhaa he ki bacchon dwaara bhaavana kii abhivyakti karnaa yaa ladakiyon kii tulana main agal tareeke se vyavhaar karnaa uchit he, yaa agar ek jaateey samooh ke bacchon dwaara siikhe gaye reeti-rivaaj kisi duusare bachche dwaara siikhe gaye reeti-rivaaj se alag hai
 The social and emotional differences between boys and girls of a specified age may also be associated with the time differences of pubertal characteristics of both sexes
 bahut zyada boli jane vaali shabdaawalee ko hasil karne ke alaava aise chaar mukhya kshetra hai jinamein bachche ko boli jane vaali bhashaa yaa boli kii parvaah kiye bina yogyata hasil karnaa jaruri hota he
 These are referred to as phonology or sound, semantics or coded meanings, syntax or the way of combining words and knowledge of using language in real or different circumstances
 grahanshil bhashaa main kramik vikaas hota he jisaki shuruyaat lagbhag 6 maheene kii aayu main hoti he
 However, in the construction of expressive language and words, there is a considerable boom since its introduction at the age of about one year, with a "vocabulary explosion" of rapid word acquisition in the middle of the second year
 yah shabdaawalee vistaar bole gaye shabdon ko dohraane kii kshamta se kaaphi kareeb se judaa hua he or unke uccharan main kaushal ke teevr adhigrahan ko sakasham banaata he
 Grammatical rules and word combinations appear around the age of two
 shabdaawalee or vyakaran kii maharath purvaskuli or skool ke varshon ke madhyam se dhire-dhire jari rahati he
 Adolescents still have fewer vocabularies than adults and experience more difficulty with passive voice-like structures
 ek maheene kii umr vaale bachche "ooh" dhvaniyon kaa uccharan kar sakate hai jo shaayad kisi aapasi "baatcheet" main dekharekh karne waalon ke saath sukhad baatcheet se utpann hota he
 According to Stern, this process is the communication of influence between adult and child in a mutual, rhythmic interaction
 parvarti baatcheet ke lenden kii aashaa se surasmyojan or "gez-kapaling" par vichaar kiya jaataa he jinamein shishu or vayask kii alag-alag bhoomika hoti he
 Around 6 to 9 months of age, children begin to pronounce more vowel characters and some consonant letters and "vowel" or repeat sounds such as "dadadada" in which some phonetic features of the later dialect are present
 is
 aisa mana jaataa he ki boli ke vikaas kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa vah samay he jise dekharekh karne vaale yah "anumaan" lagane main bitaate hai ki unka shishu kya kehane kii koshish kar rahaa he or is prakaar bachche ko uske saamaajik jagat ke saath ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 The relation of ideology in Shishur's utterances is called "shared memory" and forms a complex series of actions, intentions, and reactions in an instantaneous form
 yah tark diya gaya he ki bacchon kii swar pranaaliyon kaa vikaas is tarah hota he ki ye vayask kii bhashaaon ke samaanaantar hoti hai bhale hi ve na pahchaanane yogya "shabdon" kaa istemaal kar rahe hon
 pehle shabdon main namakaran yaa labling kaa kaary hota he lekin iskaa arth bhi hota he jaise "doodh" jiskaa matlab he ki "mujhe doodh chahie"
 aam taur par 18 maheene kii umr main lagbhag 20 shabdon kii shabdaawalee badhkar 21 maheene kii umr main 200 shabdon ke aasapaas ho jaati he
 From about 18 months of age, the child begins to combine words into two-word sentences
 aam taur par vayask iskaa vistaar, arth ko spasht karne ke liye karata he
 By 24–27 months of age, the child begins to form three or four-word sentences using logical syntax even if not quite accurate
 iske peeche siddhant yah he ki bachche niyamon ke ek buniyadi samooh kaa istemaal karte hai jaise bahuvachan shabdon ke liye 's' jodna yaa bahut zyada kathin shabdon se saral shabdon kaa nirmaan karnaa jaise chocolate biscuit ke liye "choskit" kaa istemaal karnaa
 After this, there is a rapid development in the grammar rules and the correct order of sentences
 aksar tukbandi main ruchi hone lagati he or kalpanaatmak naatak main aksar baatcheet ko shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Children's recorded monologues provide insight into the development of the process of organizing information into meaningful units
 teen saal kii umr tak baccha relative close sahit jatil vaakyon kaa istemaal karne lagata he haalaanki abhi bhi vibhinn bhashaai pranaaliyon main sudhaar kaary jari rahata he
 By the age of five, the child has started using the language quite like an adult
 lagbhag teen saal kii umr se bachche bhashaa vigyaan kii drushti se bhram yaa kalpana kaa sanket kar sakate hai, armbh or ant ke saath susangat vyaktigat kahaniyon or kaalpanik kathaon kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 It is argued that children resort to storytelling as a way of understanding their own experience and as a means of explaining their meaning to others
 vistaarit bahes main shaamil hone kii kshamta samay ke saath vayaskon or saathiyon ke saath niyamit baatcheet se utpann hoti he
 For this, the child needs to learn how to integrate his or her point of view with others' perspectives and external events, and to learn how to use linguistic indicators to prove that he or she is doing so
 ve kisase baat kar rahe hai, iske aadhaar par ve apni bhashaa ko samyojit karnaa bhi sikhte hai
 Generally, by the age of about 9 years the author can describe stories other than his own experiences, from the characters of the story and his own perspectives
 bachche ke seekhney ke kaary ko sahaj banane main vayask vaartalap kii mahatvapurn bhoomika hone ke baavjood siddhantkaron main is baat ko lekar kaaphi asahmati he ki bacchon ke aarambhik arth or arthpurna shabd, bachche ke sangyanatmak kaaryon se sambandhit aantarik karkon kii tulana main kis had tak sidhe vayask vaartalap se utpann hote hai
 Many different conclusions have been reached about the initial mapping of new words, the ability to understand words beyond context, and refining meaning
 ek pariklpana ko vaakyatmak bootstrtping pariklpana ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jo vaakya sanrachana se mili vyakaran sambandhi jaankaree kaa istemaal karke ishaare se arth kaa anumaan lagane kii bachche kii kshamta ko sandarbhit karti he
 Another hypothesis is the multi-way model in which it is argued that context-bound words and context relation words follow different paths; The former is depicted based on event performances and the latter is depicted based on mental performances
 is model main paitruk input kii atyant mahatvapurn bhoomika hone ke baavjood bachche shabdon ke parvarti upyog ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye sangyanatmak prakriya par nirbhar karte hai
 Nonetheless, natural research conducted on language development has indicated that preschool children's vocabulary is significantly associated with the number of words that adults refer to them
 
 Till now, there is no theory of language acquisition that is accepted by everyone
 jor dene ke maamle main vartmaan spashtikarnon main antar he, jahaan shikshan siddhant main sudrudhikaran or anukaran par jor diya jaataa he vahiin jaivik or swadeshvaadi siddhanton main sahaj anternihit kriyavidhiyon par or ek saamaajik prasang ke bheetar adhik parsparik drushtikon par jor diya jaataa he
 Behaviorists argue that any theory of language, based on the universal presence of the physical environment and the social environment in general, must pay attention to the effects of their cognitive relationships on the personal development of language behavior
 pinkar kaa tark he ki jatil bhashaa saarvbhaumik he or iskaa ek sahaj aadhaar hota he
 Pinker's argument is based on the development of languages from Pidgin to Creole
 pigin main vyakaranik sanrachanaon ke bina baat chit karne vaale mata-pita ke bacchon main apane aap creole bhashaa kaa vikaas ho jaataa he jo manakikrut shabd kramon or vartmaan, bhavishya or bhootkaal ke markaron or sabordinate cloj se paripurna hote hai
 This has received some support from the development of the sign language of young deaf children in special schools in Nicaragua, which spontaneously developed pidgins and was later developed as a creole by the younger generation of children attending schools
 Given
 
 Slow expressive language development, a delay in the use of words with common comprehension, is characteristic of a small proportion of children who later demonstrate general language use

 Throughout his lifetime, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles
 unhone 300 se adhik vaigyanik or 150 gaiyr-vaigyanik shodh-patr prakashit kiye
 In his 1965 lecture, Oppenheimer noted that Einstein's early writings had many errors that caused his publication to be delayed by nearly ten years: "a man whose errors took a long time to correct, how much Would be great "

 These four articles have contributed greatly to the foundation of modern physics and changed the thinking of people on space, time and matter
 ye chaar kagajaat hai: In 1900, Einstein's first research paper was on "capillary attraction", presented to Onlen der Physik
 yah 1901 main " "keshikatv ghatana se nishkarsh" sheershak ke saath prakashit kiya gaya
 Two papers published in 1902–1903 attempted to explain atomic phenomena through statistical means

 Einstein concludes that each wave of frequency is associated with a collection of photons of energy
 unhone is bare main or adhik nahin bataaya, kyonki ve aashwast nahin the kii kaise kan, laharo se sambandhit hai
 But he suggested that this hypothesis could be explained by some experimental results, which were later specifically called the photoelectric effect
 1907 main, oinstin ne ek model prastaavit kiya, kii prayek parmaanu, ek jaali sanrachana main swatantra anuroop rup se dolan karata he
 In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently
 Einstein knew that real oscillations have different frequencies but still proposed this theory, because it was a clear demonstration of how quantum mechanics, in conventional mechanics, is associated with specific heat
 Can solve the problem
 peter dibai ne is model ko parishkrut kiya
 During the 1910s, it expanded to bring individual systems within the realm of quantum mechanics
