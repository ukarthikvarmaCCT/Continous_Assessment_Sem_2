 is shabd kaa istemaal aamtaur par insaanon ke liye kiya jaataa he, lekin saidhantik rup se, pashuon ke bartaav ke kaarnon kii vyakhya ke liye bhi iskaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The reference to this article is human motivation
 vibhinn siddhanton ke anusaar, buniyadi zaruuraton main shaareerik dukh-dard ko kam karne or sukh ko adhiktam banane ke mul main abhiprerana ho sakati he, yaa isamen bhojan or aaraam jaisi khaas zaruuraton ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he; yaa ek abhilashit vastu, shauk, lakshya, astitv kii dasha, adarsh, ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, yaa inase bhi kamatar kaarnon jaise paropkaarita, naitikta, yaa mratyu sankhya se bachane ko bhi isamen aropit kiya ja saktaa he
 Intrinsic motivation itself comes from the reward inherent in a task or activity — to enjoy a puzzle or an attachment to a game
 1970 ke dashak se prerana ke is swaroop kaa adhyayan saamaajik or shaikshanik manovaigyanikon dwaara kiya ja rahaa he
 Research has found that it is usually associated with higher academic achievement and enjoyment of students
 fritz heidar ke gunaropan siddhant, bandura ke aatm-bal par kiye gaye kaaryon or rayaan or rayaan or deki ke sangyanatmak moolyankan siddhant ke jariye aantarik prerana kii vyakhya kii gayi
 Students can be internally motivated if they: antrik abhiprerana jaise: bhukh, pyaas, mal, mutr, camecha, krodh, prem, udasi adibahye abhiprerana jaise: pariksha parinam, puruskaar, dand, pratiyogita, prashansa, ninda aadi
 External motivation comes from outside the seeker
 rupaya-paisa sabase spasht udhaaharan he, lekin dabaav or sajaa kaa khatra bhi aam bahya prerana hai
 In the game, the crowd cheers on the player's performance, which may motivate him to perform better
 traphiyaan bhi bahari protsaahan hai
 The competition is also a common extrinsic motivation, as it encourages the performer to win and defeat others, not to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity
 saamaajik manovaigyanik shodh bataata he ki bahya puraskaar ati auchityata or saath hi aantarik prerana main kami kii ore le ja saktaa he
 External incentives can sometimes weaken motivation
 green or leppar dwaara kiye gaye ek clasik adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki jin bacchon ko unki chitrakaari ke liye muktahast ho kar felt-tip kalmon se puraskrit kiya gaya tha, baad main unhone kalmon ke saath phir se khilne yaa kalmon ko chitrakaari ke liye istemaal main kam ruchi dikhaai
 The number of people who perceive self-restraint of motivation as a subgroup of emotional intelligence is increasing; by balanced definition a person may be very intelligent, yet he is not motivated to dedicate this intelligence to certain tasks
 Can also happen
 yel skool of management ke professor victor vroom kaa "pratyaasha siddhant" iskaa lekha pesh karata he ki vyakti hi tay karenga ki ek vishesh lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye vah apane aatmasanyam ko kab lagu kare
 Motivation and desires can be interpreted as a lack or need, which drives one to achieve a goal or encouragement
 These thoughts originate within the individual and may not require any external catalyst to encourage behavior
 buniyadi prerakashkti kinhin kamiyon; masalan- bhukh jo ek vyakti ko bhojan kii talash ke liye prerit karata he, se kaundhti he, jabaki adhik sookshm prerakashkti prashansa or anumodan praapt karne kii ichha, jo ek vyakti ko is tarah se aacharan karne ke liye prerit kar sakati he, jisase duusare khush hon
 In contrast, the role and stimulus of external rewards is also seen in animals
 pashuon ko prashikshan dene ke dauraan jab ve sahi dhang se kisi chaal ko sahi dhang se samajhakar us kaary ko sampann karte hai to unhen acchhee tarah khilaa-pilaakar unki aavbhagat main isaki misaal dekhi ja sakati he
 Feeding animals with good food serves as a catalyst for their consistently good performance; Even when good food is not given later, their performance remains the same
 koi inaam, thos yaa amoort, ek kriya ke baad is iraade se diya jaataa he, taaki vah vyavhaar dubaara ghatit ho
 This is done by adding positive meaning to the behavior
 adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki agar vyakti ko inaam turant miltaa he, to prabhaav bahut adhik hota he or deree hote jane se prabhaav kam hota jaataa he
 Repeating a combination of verb-rewards can make that verb habit
 prerana do sroton se aati he: apane adanr se or anya logon se
 in donon sroton ko kramshah aantarik abhiprerana or bahya abhiprerana kaha jaataa he
 Applying proper motivational techniques is more difficult than it sounds
 steven kerr ne yah paaya ki jab ek inaam pranali banaayi jaati he, yah aasaan ho saktaa he ki a ko puraskrit kiya jaay, jabaki b se aashaa lagaayi ja rahi he or is prakriya main hanikaarak prabhaav padate hai jo aapke lakshyon ko jokhim main daal sakate he
 a consolidator is different from a reward, the sum of certain things in the environment is intended to produce a measured increase in the rate of desired behavior in this consolidation or reinforcement
 kai tarah ke sahaj prerana siddhant hote hai
 Instinctive motivation-reduction theory has evolved from the concept that we have certain biological innate motivation, such as hunger
 If it is not satisfied, spontaneous sedation increases with the passage of time
 prerakashkti santusht ho jaati he to uski takat kam ho jaati he
 This theory is based on a diverse range of ideas from feedback control systems such as Freud's theories of thermodynamics
 prerakashkti ke kuch sahaj gyaan yukt yaa lok vaidhata siddhant hai
 For example, when the food is being cooked, there is also a spontaneous paradigm paradigm in the rhythm of increasing appetite until the meal is ready, and there is a decrease in the occult appetite after eating the food
 kai tarah kii samasyaayein hai, tathaapi, jo sahaj prerana katautee kii vaidhata ko khuli bahes ke liye chhod detii hai
 The first problem is that it does not explain how secondary integrators reduce spontaneous motivation
 udhaaharan ke liye paison se jaivik yaa manovaigyanik jarurat puri nahin hoti, lekin tankhwaah duusare kram kii sthiti ke jariye prerakashkti ko kam kar detii he
 Secondly, an innate motivation, such as hunger, is seen as a "desire" to eat food, which makes instinctive motivation a homocular disposition - a trait that is criticized as the basic problem of the 'little man' and his desires
 It is easily said to be heart-warming
 iske alaava yah saafe he ki sahaj prerana katautee siddhant puri tarah se aacharan kaa siddhant nahin ho saktaa, yaa ek bhookha insaan khaanaa pakaana puraa karne se pehle khaae bagaiyr bhojan pakaa nahin saktaa
 sabhi prakaar ke vyavhaar se nipatane main sahaj prerana siddhant kii sakshmata, sahaj prerana ko satusht nahin karne se, yaa "swaadisht" bhojan ke liye atirikt prerakashkti lagaakar, jo "bhojan" ke liye sahaj prerakashktiyon se milakar khaanaa pakaane or swaad ke bare bataati he
 Leon Festinger has suggested that this happens when a person experiences some discomfort due to incompatibility between the two cognitions
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek upabhokta apni ek kharid ke liye khud ko aashwasit karata he, lekin saath hi vah punarawalokan karte hue sochataa he ki doosraa faisla behatar ho saktaa he
 When there is a conflict between a belief and a behavior, then another example of cognitive perception is found
 ek vyakti swasth rahanaa chahta he, uskaa maananaa he ki dhumrapaan swasthya ke liye hanikaarak he, phir bhi vah dhumrapaan jari rakhata he
 One of the most widely discussed theories of inspiration is Abraham Maslov's theory
 siddhant kaa saransh is tarah prakat kiya ja saktaa he: The list of needs from basic to most complex is as follows: fredrick harmberg kaa doharaa kaarak siddhant, urf aantarik / bahya prerana ke siddhant, kaa nishkarsh he ki kaarysthal main kuch tatwon se kaam main santushti milti he, lekin agar ye anupasthit ho to asantosh paidaa hota he
 Factors that motivate people to change their lives forever, but the feeling of 'I respect you as a person' is a very motivating factor at any stage of life
 unhone isamen is tarah fark kiya: The health factor is named because where you are clean, it is not necessary that you become more healthy, but if it is not there, your health may decline
 is siddhant ko kabhi-kabhi "abhiprerak-swatchta siddhant" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The use of Herzberg theory is found in business fields such as information systems and studies related to user satisfaction
 clayton alderfer ne maslove ke jaruraton ke padanukram kaa vistaar kar ERG siddhant ko sthapit kiya
 Physical and security needs, which are lower order requirements, are placed in the category of existence; Whereas the needs of love and self-esteem are placed in the category of affiliation
 vikaas shrenee main hamaare aatm-pratyakshikaran or atmasamman sambandhit jaruratein nihit hai
 The theory of self-determination developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan highlights the importance of intrinsic motivation as an impetus to human behavior
 maslove or is aadhaar par nirmit anya ke padanukramik siddhant kii tarah SDT vruddhi or vikaas kii swaabhaavik pravriti ko manyata detaa he
 Although like other such principles, SDT does not involve "self-driving" for any kind of achievement, but instead calls for active encouragement from the environment
 praathmik kaarak, jo prerana or vikaas ko protsaahit karte hai; ve swaittata, yogyata kii saraahna or sambhddhata hai
 The latest proposal in terms of achievement motivation is unified vision, as propounded by Heinz Schooler, George C
 Thornton III, Andreas Frintrup and Rose muller-hanson in the "onion-ring Model of Achievement Motivation"
 is vichaar kaa aadhaar yah he ki pradarshan abhiprerana ke kaaran vyaktitv kaa mukhya ghatak pradarshan kii ore rukh kar letaa he
 Consequently, it includes a sequence of dimensions that are relevant to success in the work, but which are not traditionally considered part of the performance motivation
 In particular, it integrates previously isolated perspectives with social objectives such as domination to require achievement
 uplabdhi prerana suchi isi siddhant par aadhaarit hai or vyavsaayik va peshewar safalataa ke akalan ke liye teen kaarak praasangik hai
 Goal theory is based on the assumption that sometimes people have an impetus to reach a clearly defined end
 aksar, yah ant apane aapmen ek puraskaar hota he
 a goal's efficiency is influenced by these three characteristics: proximity, difficulty, and specificity
 An ideal goal should create a situation where the time between enforcement and end of behavior is close
 yah hamen bataata he ki kuch bachche bijganit main maahir hone ke bajaay motor cycle chalaanaa seekhney ke liye kyon adhik prerit hua karte hai
 a goal should be measurable, which should not be too difficult or too easy to accomplish
 In both cases, most people are not motivated as well as those who like the challenge
 Also, people want to feel that there is a lot of possibility that they will be successful
 Uniqueness is interested in describing the goal in your classroom
 vyakti vishesh ke liye lakshya nishpaksh rup se paribhaashit or suspasht hona chahie
 Trying to get the maximum grade possible is a great example of a poorly specified goal
 adhikansh bacchon ko pataa hi nahin hota ki us lakshya tak pahunchane ke liye unhen kitna prayaas karne kii jarurat he
 Douglas Vermeiren has done extensive research on why many people fail to achieve their goals
 asafalataa ke liye sidhe-sidhe prerit karkon ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he
 Vermeiren states that unless a person clearly identifies his motivating factor or his important and meaningful reasons, why would he want to achieve the goal, he will never have the power to achieve it
 vyavhaar parivartan ke saamaajik-sangyanatmak model main prerana or ichhashakti kaa nirmaan shaamil he
 Motivation is seen as a process that leads to the creation of behavioral intentions
 ichhashakti ko ek aisi prakriya ke rup main dekha jaataa he jo iraade ko vaastavik vyavhaar kii ore le jane kaa kaam karti he
 In other words, motivation and will are seen in terms of setting and achieving goals respectively
 donon prakriyaaon main aatm-niamak prayaason kii aavashyaktaa he
 Many self-regulatory creations need to work in Vrindavadana to achieve the goal
 aatm-gun yaa aatm-bal ko samajhnaa abhiprerak or ichhashakti rachana kaa ek udhaaharan he
 Self-confidence is facilitated by the development of behavioral intentions, the development of action plans and the will of action
 yah iraade ko karrwai main badalane main madad kar saktaa hai
 Some psychologists believe that an important part of human behavior is energized and guided by subliminal motivation
 maslove ke anusaar, "manovishleshan ne aksar hi dikhaaya he ki ek sachet ichha or param achetan lakshya ke bich rishte kaa aadhaar pratyaksh hone kii jarurat nahin
" duusare shabdon main, bataayi gayi abhiprerana hameshaa kushal paryvekshakon dwaara lagaaye gaye anumaan se mail nahin khaati
 udhaaharan ke liye, yah sambhav he ki ek vyakti durghatana-pravan ho, kyonki usamen khud ko chot pahunchane kii achetan ichha he or isliye nahin ki vah laaparvaah yaa suraksha-niyamon se anjaan he
 Similarly, some overweight people are not hungry for food at all, but are restless to fight and kiss
 bhojan karnaa dhyaan kii kami kaa mahaj ek rakshaatmak pratikriya he
 Some workers do more damage to equipment than others, because of their subconscious feelings of anger against management
 manochikitsakon kaa kahana he ki kuch vyavhaar itane swachaalit hote hai ki vyakti ke chetan man main iske kaaran uplabdh nahin ho pate
 badhyakaari cigarette dhumrapaan iskaa ek udhaaharan he
 Sometimes it is so important to maintain self-esteem and the motivation for an activity is so frightening that it cannot be understood, in fact, that is disguised or suppressed
 yuktisangat, yaa "vyakhya se pare", aise chhadmavesh yaa raksha pranali he, ke naam se yah janaa jaataa he
 Another example is to blame our own mistakes on others
 "mujhe lagata he ki mujhe dosha diya jaay", darasal "yah uski galati he, vah swaarthee he" main badal jaataa he
 The suppression of powerful but socially unacceptable seductiveness can turn into ostentatious behavior, contrary to repressed tendencies
 udhaahranswarup, ek karmchaaree jo apane bos se nafrat karata he, lekin vah kuch zyada hi kaam kiya karata he taaki aisa lage ki bos ke prati uske man main bada adarbhav he
 Subliminal motivations impede the interpretation of human behavior and the extent to which they exist makes the administrator's life as difficult
 duusari ore, achetan prerakashktiyon ke astitv kii jaankaree se vyavhaar kii samasyaon kaa or adhik chaukas akalan kiya ja saktaa he
 Although some contemporary psychologists deny the existence of subliminal factors, many believe that they are only active in times of anxiety and stress and, from the point of view of human behavior in normal life events - are rationally objective
 
 6,000 se adhik logon par kiye gaye adhyayan kii shuruyaat se professor steven reis ne ek siddhant prastaavit kiya, jisamen 16 buniyadi ichchhaaon kii baat kahi gayi he jo lagbhag sabhi insaani vyavhaar main paaya jaataa he
 These wishes are as follows: is model main, in buniyadi ichchhaaon par logon main matbhed he
 These basic desires represent intrinsic motivation that directly motivates a person's behavior and are not intended to satisfy other desires indirectly
 log gaiyr-buniyadi ichchhaaon se bhi prerit ho sakate hai, lekin is maamle main gabhir prerana se yah sambandhit nahin he, yaa keval anya buniyadi ichchhaaon ko praapt karne ke saadhan ke taur par akelaa saadhan nahin he
 Control over motivation is understood to a limited extent only
 abhiprerana prashikshan ' ke vibhinn drushtikon hai, lekin aalochakon dwaara inamen se kai ko chhadam vaigyanik mana gaya he
 In order to know how to control motivation, it is necessary to first understand why many people lack motivation
 aadhunik khyaal is manovaigyanik siddhant ko anubhavsiddh sahaayta pradaan karata he ki bachapan main hi mote taur par bhaavnaatmak programing ho jaaya karti he
 Harold Chugani, Medical Director of PET Clinic of Children's Hospital of Michigan and Professor of Pediatrics, Neuroscience and Radiology at Wayne State University School of Medicine, found that children's brains would be far more capable of receiving new information than adults

 In addition to absolutely straightforward approaches to motivation, in early life, there are solutions that are more absolute, but perhaps not more practical, for self-motivation
 vastutah har abhiprerana paridarshika main kam se kam ek adhyay vyakti ke kaaryon or lakshyon kii samuchit vyavastha ke bare main hota he
 It is generally suggested that it is necessary to list tasks by distinguishing between tasks that have been completed and those that have not been completed, so some of the necessary motivation to create that in that "meta-task" Should be moved, in the task list which is described as the progress of the task, which can become a routine
 puure kiye gaye kaaryon kii suchi dekhnaa bhi prerak kaa kaam kar saktaa he, kyonki yah uplabdhi ke liye ek santoshjanak bhaavana paidaa kar sakati he
 This is the basic functionality in most electronic works lists, although the difference between completed and incomplete tasks is not always clear
 soochna vyavastha ke anya rup bhi abhiprerak ho sakate hai, jaise ki kisi ke vichaaron ko vyavasthit karne ke liye man ke nakshe kaa upyog or is prakaar tantrika network ko is tarah "prashikshit" karnaa, jisase ki maanviya mastishk die gaye kaaryon par dhyaan kendrit kare

 Anything needed to keep the workers employed in any organization

 But, sometimes it is not enough for the employees to continue working in the institution just for the salary
 karmchaaree ko ek company yaa sanstha ke liye kaam karne ko prerit kiya janaa jaruri he
 If there is no motivation present in an employee, then the quality of his work or generally all work will decline
 karmchaaree-prerana kaa antim lakshya he puri kshamta ke saath karmchaaree ko kaam par lagaaye rakhana
 karmchaariyon ko prerit karne ke kai tareeke hai
 There are some traditional ways of motivating employees by making them competitive

 Some authors, particularly those associated with the Trans Humanist movement, suggest that "smart drugs", also known as nootropics, should be used as "inspiration-catalysts"
 dimag par inamen se kai dawaaon ke prabhaav ko suspasht rup se nahin samajha gaya he or unki kanoonee sthiti aksar khule prayog ko mushkil banaati he
 Educational psychologists are particularly interested in motivation because of its important role in the education of students
 haalanki, prerana ke vishisht prakaar kaa adhyayan anya kshetron main manovaigyanikon dwaara kiye ja rahe kahin adhik saamaanya rup ke adhyayanon se gunatmak rup se alag he
 In education, motivation can have different effects on how a student learns and how they behave towards the subject matter
 yah kar saktaa he: Because students are not always intrinsically motivated, they sometimes require established motivation, which is found in the environment created by the teacher
 prerana do prakaar kii hoti hai: It is also worth noting that the expansion of this dichotomy of motivation, such as the principle of self-determination, has already been questioned
 aatmakendrit varnakram vikaar ke upachaar main prerana ko ek aadharbhoot kshetra, nirnaayak pratikriya therapy ke rup main paaya gaya he
 Inspiration is also an important element in the concept of andragogy
 sadabari model skulon kaa yah nishkarsh he ki saamaanya taur par seekhney main or vishesh rup se vaigyanik nirakshartaa main, vilamb kii samasya kaa ilaaj yah he ki asli rog: skulon main baadhyataa, ko sab ke liye sire se hi samaapt kar diya jaay

 They insist that schools keep this campaign alive, as some schools are doing: openly nurturing, which is necessary for them to thrive

 Students decide for themselves how to measure their self-assessment for the learner as a process of self-assessment: they present the whole of real-life learning and appropriate academic assessment for the 21st century
 sadabari model skool ke mutabik, yah niti apane chaatro ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaati, jab ve skool ke baahar ke jivan main pravesh karte hai
 However, they admit that this makes the process more difficult, but such difficulty teaches students to make their own way, set their own standards and meet their goals
 shreneekaran or yogyata nirdhaaran nahin karne kii niti se chaatro ke bich pratispardhaa yaa vayask anumodan kii ladaai se mukt maahaul banane main madad milti he or chaatro ke bich ek sakaaratmak sahakaari vaataavaran ko protsaahan miltaa he
 At the bottom of Maslov's hierarchy of needs, such as physical needs, money is a motivator, although its motivational effect only lasts for a short period on employees
 Both Abraham Maslov's theory of persuasion and Douglas mcgregor's x theory and y theory state that praise, respect, recognition, authority and the feeling of being something are far more powerful motivations than money in higher level positions
 maslove ne padanukram ke nimnatam str par paise ko rakhaa or anya zaruuraton ko karmchaariyon ke liye behatar abhiprerak bataaya
 mcgregor placed money in its x theory category and felt it was a weak motivator

 An effective leader must understand how to manage all the characters, and it is more important for the manager to use the paths that provide employees with opportunities to work independently, grow and find answers

 In short, scientific management bases human motivation on external factors and rejects internal incentives

 With this view in mind, his advisory firm, Maqbare & Company, set its first motto "to keep everyone productive, happy and free
" For mcclelland, a person's satisfaction with basic motivation drives his life

 The Big Five factors and their shared characteristics can be summarized as follows: big five model ko vyaktitv manovigyaan ke itihaas main sabase vyapak, anubhavsiddh, data-sanchalit shodh nishkarsh mana gaya he
 Identification of features and structure of human personality has been one of the most basic goals in holistic psychology

 The initial model was developed by Ernest Troupes and Raymond Crystal, based on work done in the US Air Force Personnel Laboratory in the late 1950s; Unfortunately, he documented his work only in an anonymous technical report
 In 1990, JM Diggman developed his five-factor personality model, which Goldberg expanded to the highest level of organization
 These five super-dominant domains have been found to contain and incorporate well-known personality traits within their five domains and represent the basic structure behind all personality traits
 ve manovaigyanikon dwaara satat rup se prastaavit vishisht nune-stareey vyaktitv avadharanaon ke praayah-vismayakari suchi main ek vyavastha le aae hai
 These five factors provide a rich conceptual framework for all research findings and theory of personality psychology
 big five lakshanon ko "paanch kaarak model" yaa FFM, or vyaktitv ke vaishvik ghatak ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa he 
 At least four teams of researchers have worked on this problem for decades independently and have generally identified the same five great factors: tupes and crystals were the first and followed by Goldberg at the Oregon Research Institute, Cattell at the University of Illinois, and Then Costa and mccray at the National Institutes of Health
 These four teams of researchers used somewhat different methods in finding the five traits and thus the names and definitions of each set of five factors are somewhat different

 It is important to note that these traits have been found to organize the personality at the highest level and are therefore supportive of the most conceptual, well-organized framework for regular, low-level personality traits
 tathaapi, big five lakshan itane vyapak or vistrut hai ki ve nichle-str ke asankhya lakshanon kii tulana main vaastavik vyavhaar kaa purvanumaan lagane or vyakhya karne main lagbhag utane prabhaavshaalee nahin hai
 Several studies have confirmed that predicting the actual behavior of myriad aspects or primary-level symptoms has been more effective
 jab vyaktigat prati-soochna ke liye ank die jaaen, ye lakshan aksar pratishat praptankon main prastut kiye jate hai
 For example, the dutiful status of the 80th percentile indicates a sense of orderliness and orderliness in relatively dominant responsibility, while the extraterritorial status in the 5th percentile indicates an extraordinary need for solitude and peace
 haalanki ye lakshan samooh sankhyikeey samucchy hai, vyaktigat vyaktitv profile main apwaad maujuud ho sakate hai
 On average, people who are elevated in openness are intellectually curious, liberal in spirit, interested in art, and willing to try new things

 Openness is a general appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, imagination, curiosity and diverse experience
 yah lakshan kalpanasheel logon ko vyaavhaarik, paramparaagat logon se alag pahachaanata he
 People who are open to experience are intellectually curious, appreciative of art and sensitive to beauty
 unki tulana paripurna, adhik rachanaatmak or apni bhaawanaaon ke bare main jaagruk logon se kii jaati he
 They are more likely to have unconventional beliefs
 khulepan main kam ank paane vaale logon main adhik paramparaagat, paaramparik dilchaspiyaan hone kii sambhaavna he
 They prefer more plain, honest and clarity than complex, obscure and esoteric
 ve kala or vigyaan ko andeh kii drushti se dekh sakate hai, jin prayaason ko ve ankarshak maan sakate hai
 Some self-assertions of openness include: kartavyanishtha swa-anushaasan darshane, kartavyaparayan rahane or kaarysiddhi ko lakshya banane kii ek pravriti he
 This characteristic reflects a preference for schematic rather than spontaneous behavior
 yah hamaare aavegon ko niyantrit, viniyamit or sanchalit karne ke tareeqe ko prabhavit karti he
 Duties include factors known as the need for accomplishment
 bahirmukhataa kii visheshtaayen hai sakaaratmak bhavanaaen, milansaarita or uttejnaa or dusron kaa saath chaahane kii pravriti
 is visheshta kii khaasiyat he bahari duniya ke saath spasht taur par judana
 bahirmukhiyon ko anya logon ke saath judane main mazaa aata he or aksar utsaah se bhare maane jate hai
 They are enthusiastic, action-oriented individuals who always say "yes!" o far!" There is a possibility of saying
 samoohon main ve baat karnaa, apni baat par drudh rahanaa or khud kii ore dhyaan aakarshith karnaa pasand karte hai
 Introvert people lack social glee and activity level like extroverts
 ve shant, sanyat, satark or saamaajik duniya main kam shaamil hote hai
 Their lack of social participation should not be taken as shame or depression
 Introvert people need less excitement and more loneliness than extrovert people
 ve bahut sakriy or urjavan ho sakate hai, keval saamaajik rup se nahin
 Agreeableness is the tendency to be sensitive and cooperative rather than suspicious and hostile towards others
 yah visheshta saamaajik sadbhaav ke liye saamaanya chintaa main vyaktigat matbhedon ko darshata he
 Agreeable persons value walking with other people
 ve aam taur dusron kaa lihaaz karne vaale, maitreepurn, udaar, madadgaar or dusron ke liye apane hiton se samjhauta karne ko taiyaar hote hai
 Agreed people also have an optimistic view of human nature

 Disagreeing people value their selfishness more than walking with others
 aam taur par ve dusron kii bhalaai ke bare main udasin rahete hai or anya logon ke liye unke saamne aane kii kam sambhaavna he
 Sometimes their doubt about the purpose of others makes them suspicious, rude and uncooperative
 manovikshubdhta krodh, chintaa, yaa avsaad jaisi nakaaratmak bhaawanaaon ko anubhav karne kii pravriti he
 This is sometimes called emotional instability
 jo log manovikshubdhta main adhik ank pate hai ve bhaavnaatmak rup se pratikriyasheel or tanaav ke prati kamazor hote hai
 They are more likely to consider common situations as distressing and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult
 unki nakaaratmak bhaavnaatmak pratikriyaayein asaamaanya rup se lambey samay tak bane rahane kii sambhaavna he, jiskaa arth he ki ve aksar karaab mood main rahete hai
 These problems of emotional control in a person with high scores in dementia reduce their ability to think clearly, make decisions, and deal effectively with stress
 paimaane ke duusare chor par, manovikshubdhta main kam ank paane vaale vyakti, aasaani se pareshaan nahin hote or bhaavnaatmak rup se kam pratikriyasheel hote hai
 They are calm, emotionally stable and free from constant negative emotions

 The hypothesis further suggests that from the language sample, it is possible to extract a broad classification of human personality traits

 Raymond Cattell obtained the allport-odbert list in the 1940s, added words derived from psychological research and then reduced the total words to 171, removing synonyms
 He later asked the research persons to give the status to people whom he knew from the adjectives in the list and then analyzed their ratings
 catel ne vyaktitv lakshanon ke 35 pramukh samoohon kii pahchaan kii, jinhen unhone "vyaktitv kshetra" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya
 He and his colleagues then created a personality test for these symptoms
 The data they received from these tests were analyzed in conjunction with emerging computer technology, including the statistical method of factor analysis

 Raymond Cattell saw these developments as an attack on his 16PF model and never agreed to the incremental five-factor consensus
 They refer to "

 For the next two decades, the changing escalation made publication of personality research difficult
 In his 1968 book Personality and Assessment, Walter Michel asserted that personality tests cannot predict behavior with correlations greater than 0
3
 Social psychologists such as Michele argue that attitudes and attitudes do not remain constant, but change with status
 vyaktitv pareekshanon dwaara vyavhaar kaa purvanumaan asambhav mana jaataa tha
 In the 1970s, radical stalwarts went to the extent of arguing that personality was the only perceived structure that people impose on others to create an illusion of stability in the world

 This resulted in a substantial increase of correlations between personality and behavior and it was clear that "personality" actually existed

 Lewis Goldberg himself began his literal project, independently re-locating the five factors, and respectively attracted the attention of psychologists
 baad main unhone karkon ke liye label ke rup main shabd gadha "big five"
 At a symposium held in Honolulu during 1981, four leading researchers, Lewis Goldberg, Naomi takemoto-chok, Andrew Comrey, and John M
 Digman, reviewed the available personality tests of that day
 He concluded that the most promising tests measured a subset of five common factors, similar to what Normain discovered in 1963

 Shortly after the Pentagon, in 1985 the NEO Five Factor Personality List was published by Costa and mccrae
 sabase mahatvapurn vikaas main se ek paanch kaarak model ek saamaanya vargeekaran kii sthapana he jo pehle bikhare hue tathaa avyavasthit kshetra main anukram darshata he
 What distinguishes the five-factor model of personality from all others is that it is not based on the principle of one specific psychologist, but rather the language, the natural system that people use to communicate their understanding of each other

 There has been an incremental body of research around these personality traits since the 1990s, when psychologists unanimously supported the Big Five, respectively
 sabhi paanch kaarak donon anuvanshikta or paryaavaran se prabhavit hote dikhte hai
 Twin studies suggest that these effects contribute in roughly equal proportions
 uplabdh adhyayanon ke vishleshan ne big five lakshanon ke liye samagratah vanshanugatata ko nimnatah paaya: Several studies of longitudinal data that correlate people's test scores and representative-group data over time, comparing personality levels across different age groups, indicate high levels of stability in personality traits during adulthood

 In addition to these collective effects, there have also been individual differences: different people exhibit unique change patterns at all stages of life

 It has often been suggested that individuals differ by their order of birth

 He claims that the firstborn is more dutiful, more socially effective, less agreeable and less open to new ideas than a later-born child

 One criticism is that their data disrupts family size with birth order

 The Big Five has been replicated in many different languages and cultures such as German and Chinese

 The reasons for these differences are as yet unknown; It is an active area of research

 Critics argue that there exists scope for the scope of the Big Five as an explanatory or predictive theory
 yah bahes kii jaati he ki big five sabhi maanav vyaktitv kii vyakhya nahin karte hai
 The methodology used to identify the dimensional structure of personality traits, factor analysis, has often been challenged by not having a global-validation basis for choosing between solutions, including various factors
 ek or satat aalochana yah he ki big five siddhant se prerit nahin he
 It is simply a data-driven investigation of certain descriptors with a tendency to coalesce, subject to factor analysis
 ek aam aalochana yah he ki big five sabhi maanav vyaktitv kii vyakhya nahin karata he
 Some disagree with the psychological model simply because they believe it neglects other personality domains such as religiosity, deceit / deceitfulness, honesty, affordability, conservatism, masculinity / femininity, arrogance, humor, identity, self-concept, and motivation

 mcadams has named the Big Five the "psychology of the stranger", as they refer to symptoms that are relatively easily seen in a stranger; Other aspects of personality that are more privately held or more context-based are barred in the Big Five
 kai adhyayanon main, paanch kaarak puri tarah se ek duusare ke saath lambik hai; arthath paanch kaarak swatantra nahin hai
 Negative correlations often appear between psychosis and extroversion, for example, showing that people who tend to encounter more negative emotions tend to be less talkative and outgoing
 lambikata ko kuch shodhakartaaon ne vaanchhneeya ke rup main dekha he, kyonki yah ayaamon ke bich atirek ko kam karata he
 This is especially important when the goal of a study is to provide a broad description of personality, with as little changers as possible

 Namely, the five-factor solution depends to some extent by the analyst
 adhikansh kaarak, vastav main, in paanch karkon ke mul main ho sakate hai
 This has prompted controversy about the "real" number of factors

 a systematic criticism often directed towards the Big Five is that much of the evidence is on self-report questionnaires; It is impossible to deal fully with self-report bias and falsification of responses
 yah vishesh rup se mahatvapurn ho jaataa he jab vichaar kiya jaae ki kyon vyaktiyon yaa logon ke samoohon ke bich prapthank alag hote hai - ankon main antar vyaktitv main antarnihit vaastavik antar kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he, yaa ve bas anusandhanadhin vyaktiyon dwaara prashnon kaa uttar dene ke tareeke ke shilp-tathy ho sakate hai
 The five factor structures are replicated in peer reports
 haalanki, kai tathvik nishkarsh swa-reporton par nirbhar karte hai
 a continuing criticism is that the Big Five is not based on any underlying principle; It is only the empirical conclusion that some descriptors under factor analysis accumulate together
 haalanki iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki ye paanch kaarak maujuud nahin he, unke peeche antarnihit kaaran agyaat rahe hai
 The desire and pleasure of sensation is not associated with extroversion because of an underlying principle; This relationship is a plausible empirical conclusion
 vartmaan anusandhan asankhya kshetron main kendrit he
 An important question is: are the five factors correct? Attempts to replicate the Big Five in other countries with local dictionaries have been successful in some countries, but not others
 Apparently, for example, Hungarians do not see the presence of any single agreeableness factor
 Other researchers find evidence for concurrence but not other factors

 Another area of investigation is to create a complete model of personality
 Big five personality traits are empirical observations, not theories; Explanations of observations of personality research are still pending

 Although they do not follow the lexical hypothesis, they favor a theory-driven approach inspired by the same sources, similar to the sources of the Big Five

 The beginning of the commercial revolution in Europe was a byproduct of two events respectively - isaayiyon ke pavitra tirth sthal jerusalem ko turkon se mukt karaane ke liye ek dirghakaalin dharm yuddh chalaa
 An important effect of this religious war was that the knowledge of the Bhogavilas of India, the spices of the Malabar region and the eastern islands, etc
 were learned

 ye bhinnataaain janmajaat bhi hoti hai
 Some people are of intelligent intellect from birth and some are of intelligent intellect
 aajkal buddhi ko buddhi labdhi ke rup main maapte hai jo ek sankhyatmak maan he
 IQ test refers to those tests which indicate the relation of a person's general intelligence and the various special abilities present in it through only a number in the form of intelligence
 koun vyakti kitna budhimaan he, yah jaanane ke liye manovaigyanikon ne kaaphi praytn kiye
 Psychologists have presented mental age and physical age factors to measure intelligence and based on this, the actual intelligence of the person is determined
 unnisvin sadi main mand buddhi vaale baalkon evam vyaktiyon ke prati bahut hi bura vyavhaar hota tha
 They were kept in chains and beaten
 logon kii yah manyata thi ki inamen duratmaon kaa pravesh ho gaya he
 In order to get rid of these alleged misdeeds, the boys with low intelligence were beaten
 atah mand buddhi baalkon ke liye samasya yah thi ki unki buddhi ke bare main us samay tak koi jaanata nahin tha
 In France, this problem of the children of intellect or intellectualism took serious form till then the attention of the government and psychologists there went to this problem
 is samasya kaa samaadhaan karne hetu france ke suprasiddh manovaigyanik itard tathaa unke pashchaat segun mahoday ne mand buddhi baalkon kii yogyataon ke adhyayan evam maapan karne hetu vibhinn vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya
 Under this study, he created some intelligence tests
 mand buddhi baalkon ke upachaar ke liye kai vidyalayon kii sthapana hui jahaan mand buddhi baalkon kaa pareekshan kiya jaataa tha tathaa unki buddhi vikaas hetu unhen pryikshan pradaan kiya jaataa tha
 This type of effort also happened in Germany, England and America
 parantu buddhi pareekshan ke sahi maapan ke kshetra main vikaspurn kaary kaa shrey france ko hi jaataa he
 In France, a committee was formed to provide proper training to the mentally retarded children and to properly manage their education and their chairman was made the famous psychologist Alfred Binay
 bine pehle ve manovaigyanik the jinhone buddhi ko vaigyanik evam vyavasthit rup main samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 He is considered the father of the measurement field of intelligence
 binet ne yah spasht kiya ki buddhi keval ek kaarak nahin he jisko ki ham ek vishesh pareekshan dwaara maap saken apitu yah vibhinn yogyataon kii vah jatil prakriya he jo samgr rup se kriyanvit hoti he
 In 1905, Binet, with the help of Simon, created the first intelligence scale, that is, called the binay-simon intelligence test
 ye buddhi pareekshan teen se solah varsh kii aayu ke bacchon kii buddhi kaa maapan karata he
 In this test, thirty terms were used in order of difficulty with ease
 is pareekshan se vyaktiyon ke buddhi ke staron kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 With the help of this test, the children with mental retardation are divided into three groups - san 1908 main bine ne apane buddhi pareekshan main paryaapt sanshodhan kiya or sanshodhit buddhi pareekshan kaa prakaashan kiya
 There were 59 posts in this test
 ye pad alag-alag samoohon main hai, jo alag-alag aayu ke baalkon se sambandhit hai
 In this test, the first mental age factor was understood
 san 1911 main bine ne apane 1908 ke buddhi pareekshan main punah sanshodhan kiya
 When the Binay Simane Intelligence Test of Binay went to 1908 different countries like Belgium, England, America, Italy, Germany, the interest of psychologists turned towards this test
 kaalaantar main is pareekshan kii aalochana bhi hui kyonki yah pareekshan nimna ayustar waalon ke liye to thik tha, parantu ucch ayuvarg ke baalkon ke liye sahi nahin tha
 Therefore, Binay made substantial improvements in his 1908 trial to correct this deficiency
 unhone apane pareekshan ke falankan paddati main bhi sudhaar or sanshodhan kiya tathaa 1911 main apni sanshodhit bine-saiman maapni yaa pareekshan kaa punah prakaayan kiya
 He established the relation between the mental age of this test and the actual age of the child and based on this, he divided the boys into three classes
 bine ke anusaar jo balak apni aayu samooh se ucch aayu samooh vaale prashnon kaa hal kar lete hai to ve shreshth buddhi vaale kehalaate hai or yadi balak apni aayu samooh se kam aayu samooh vaale prashnon kaa hi hal kar pate hai to ve mand buddhi balak hote hai
 In addition, in 1916, the American psychologist Turman published Binay's IQ test by adapting it to the circumstances of his country
 yah pareekshan stenford-bine pareekshan kehalaata he
 Since this test was revised by Professor Turman of Stanford University
 is aadhaar par is pareekshan ko ‘stenford-bine pareekshan’ kaha gaya
 In 1937 Prof
 MM By amending the 1916 Stanford Binay test in collaboration with Merrill, it also put some arithmetic questions in it
 1960 main stenford vishvavidhyalay se is pareekshan kaa vartmaan sanshodhan prakashit kiya gaya
 Additionally Bobar Tyga published its German revision in 1913
 landan main bart ne iskaa sanshodhan kar ise 'landan sanshodhan' ke naam se prakashit kiya
 Apart from this, Cephiot in Italy and Uttar Pradesh Psychology School in India adapted and revised this test according to their own country and published it
 bine-saiman buddhi pareekshan ke sanshodhano ke atirikt bhi kai buddhi pareekshanon kaa nirmaan hua jinamein vyaktigat buddhi pareekshan evam samuhik buddhi pareekshan, vaachik evam avaachik buddhi pareekshan bhi sammilit hai
 These are all personal or personal tests and are used only once on the subject

 pakistan kii sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan kanoonee or sanvaidhanik maamalon main faisla karne vaali antim madhyasth bhi he
 The permanent office of the Supreme Court is located in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, while many sub-branches of this court are functioning in important cities of Pakistan where cases are heard
 sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan ko kai sanvaidhanik va nyaayik vikalp praapt hote hai, jinaki vyakhya pakistan ke samvidhan main kii gai he
 The Supreme Court has established itself even during the tenure of several military governments and unconstitutional dictatorial governments in the country
 saath hi, is adaalat ne sainya shakti par ek vaastavik nireekshak ke rup main swayan ko sthapit kiya he or kai avasaron main sarkaron kii nigaraanee kii he
 This court has appellate authority over all high courts and federal courts
 iske alaava yah kuch prakaar ke maamalon par mul adhikaar bhi rakhata he
 The Supreme Court is made up of a Chief Justice and a set number of senior judges, who are nominated by the President after consulting the Prime Minister
 ek baar niyukt nyaayadhish ko, ek nirdisht avadhi ko puraa karne or uske baad hi ritair hone kii ummid kii jaati he, jab tak ki ve duraachaar ke kaaran sarvocch nyaayik parishad dwaara nilambit nahin kiye jate hai
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan was established by the 1956 Constitution
 isane 1948 main, aadesh dwaara sthapit, sangheey adaalat kaa navaroop tha
 Since its formation in 1956, it has retained its judicial authority and has been successful in asserting its authority even during the tenure of several Saini governments
 1956 ke samvidhan ke anusaar: ucchtam nyaayalay karanchi main sthapit thi, parantu 1949 main ise lahore main punarsthapit kar diya gaya, jahaan yah maujuuda lahore ucch nyaayalay ke bhawan main kaaryshil tha
 In the 1973 Constitution document, the Supreme Court has been set up in Islamabad and it is hoped that the Supreme Court should be established in the capital of the country
 parantu raashi ke abhaav ke kaaran nyaayalay ke bhawan ko us samay islamabad main nahin nirmit kiya ja sakaa tha
 So in 1974 the court was moved from Lahore to Rawalpindi
 1989 main, sarkaar dwaara islamabad main sarvocch nyaayalay ke nae bhawan ke nirmaan ke liye dhanrashi aavantit kii gai
 The construction of the existing building on the Constituency Avenue of Islamabad started only in 1990, but due to the lack of money, only the main building could be constructed by 1993, so further construction was stopped in 1993
 31 disambar 1993 main nayaayalay ko rawalpindi se islamabad main nirmit bhawan main punarsthapit kiya gaya evam parisar ke anya bhawanon ke nirmaan ko 2011 tak puraa kiya gaya
 The options, layout, rules and duties of the court Pakistan have been identified in Article 176 Ta 191 in Part 7, Chapter II of the Constitution of Pakistan
 unke lekh kaa sarsari samiksha aabhal main kaha gaya he: In addition to the observations described above, the constitution has been ordered to contact the court in legal, constitutional and domestic matters in Ja Baja second chapter and sections in Pakistan
 pakistan ke nyaayik vyavastha main sarvocch nyaayalay kaa yah bhoomika spasht he ki vah pakistan ke anya bhaagon main na keval sanvaidhanik or kanoonee najar rakhe balki unke sarkari shakhaon main vikalp or kartavyon kii sahi pahchaan or vitaran bhi amal main laae
 Sections 176 to 190 of the Constitution give several constitutional powers to the Supreme Court, the use of which can control and hinder the President's work independence
 udhaahranswaroop: samvidhan ke anusaar raashtrapati ke paas qaumi asembli ko bhang karne kaa adhikaar he, parantu aise kisi bhi vivaadasper bhangan ko vaiddh yaa avaiddh qaraar dene kaa adhikaar sarvocch nyaayalay ko diya gaya he
 Apart from this, the court has also been empowered to inspect any decision and order taken by the President and declare it as non-constitutional and illegal
 haalaanki ye praavdhaan samvidhan dwaara ankit kiye gaye hai, parantu inhen aamtaur par upyog nahin kiya jaataa he
 But if seen in the context of constitutional history of Pakistan, then such rights have been used on many occasions

 Politics gateway sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan kii nyaaypalika kaa shikaar bindu he, evam pakistani nyaayik tantra kaa shreshthatam va ucchtam nyaayalay he
 Pakistan has a hierarchical system of judiciary in which there are two classes of courts: shreshthatar nyaaypalika main, ucchtam nyaayalay ke atirikt, sangheey sharia adaalat or paanch prantiy ucch nyaayalayon aate hai, jiske sheersh par supreme court virajman he
 At the lower level of the Supreme Court, there is a High Court constituted for each of the four provinces and the capital city of Islamabad
 pakistan kaa samvidhan, nyaaypalika par samvidhan kii raksha, sangrakshan va bachaav kaa daayitv saunpta he
 Neither the Supreme Court nor the High Court can exercise jurisdiction in respect of tribal areas, unless otherwise provided

 Criminal courts were created under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and civil courts were established by the West Pakistan Civil Courts Ordinance, 1964
 saath hi, rajasav adaalatein bhi hai, jo ki pashchimi pakistan bhu-rajasav adhinium, 1967 ke tahat kaam kar rahe hai
 The decisions taken by all these courts are appeal-bound

 At the same time, according to modern tradition, the Chief Justice of Pakistan was the first Chief Justice Sir Abdul Rashid
 maujuuda sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon ke anusaar sarvocch nyaayalay main mukhya nyaayadhish ke atirikt, adhiktam 16 or nyaayadhish rah sakate hai

 According to Aryabhata, the Mahabharata war took place in 3137 BCE
 kaliyug kaa armbh krishna ke is yuddh ke 35 varsh pashchaat nidhan par hua
 According to Encyclopedia of Hinduism, the Kali Yuga started from 3102 BCE immediately after Lord Krishna's departure from this earth

 The king began to rule according to Parikshit Dharma and according to the Brahmins
 uttar naresh kii putree iravati ke saath unhone apana vivaah kiya or us uttam patni se unke chaar putr utpann huye
 By making Acharya Krupa a Guru, he performed three Ashwamedha Yagyas on the banks of Jahnavi
 un yagyon main anant dhan raashi brahmanon ko daan main di or digvijay hetu nikal gayi
 At the same time, Dharma made the form of a bull and met Gaurupini Earth on the Saraswati coast
 gaurupini prithvi kii netron se ashru bah rahe the or vah shrihin si prathit ho rahi thi
 Religion asked the Earth - "oh God! Why are you being mistaken? What are you worried about? Are you worrying about me, now that i am left with only one foot or you are talking about this?" Worried that now the Shudra will rule over you? " prithvi boli - "he dharm! tum sarvajna hokar bhi mujh se mere dukh kaa kaaran poochhate ho! satya, pavitrataa, kshamaa, dayaa, santosh, tyaag, sham, dam, tap, saralata, kshamta, shaastra vichaar, uparati, titiksha, gyaan, vairaygy, shaury, tej, aishwarya, bal, smriti, kaanti, kaushal, swatantrata, nirbhikta, komalta, dhairya, saahas, sheel, vinay, saubhaahgya, utsaah, gambheertha, kirti, aastikta, sthirataa, gaurav, ahankaarhinta aadi gunon se yukt bhagwaan shrikrishna ke swadham gaman ke kaaran ghor kaliyug mere upar aa gaya he

 Now my good luck has ended
 " While Dharma and Prithvi were talking about this, Kali Yuga came there as a crowned Shudra and started killing them both
 raja parakshit digvijay karte huye vahiin par se guzar rahe the
 They saw the crowned Shudra with a stick in his hand, beating a cow and a bull badly
 vah bail atyant sundar tha, uskaa shwet rang tha or keval ek pair tha
 The cow was also beautiful like Kamadhenu
 donon hi bhaybheet ho kar kaanp rahe the
 Maharaj Parikshit offered his bow and bowed in a solemn voice like a cloud - "O wicked! Sinner! Naradham! Who are you? Why are you torturing these innocent cows and bulls? You are a great criminal
" tere aparaadh kaa uchit dand tera vadh hi he
 "on hearing these words, Kali Yuga shivered with fear
 maharaj ne bail se poocha ki he bail tumhaare teen pair cas toote gayi hai
 You are a bull or a god
 he dhenuputr! tum nirbhiktapurvak apana apana vrutant mujhe bataao
 Hey Gaumata! Now you are free from fear
 main dushton ko dand detaa hoon
 Which evil has committed this stigma in the holy fame of the Pandavas by committing gross sins in my kingdom? Even if he is a sinful true God, i will cut off his hands too
 tab dharm bolaa - "he maharaj! aapane bhagwaan shrikrishna ke parambhakt pandavon ke kul main janm liya he atah ye vachan aap hi ke yogya hai
 Hey Rajan! We do not know who afflicts the creatures of the world
 shastron main bhi iskaa nirupan anek prakaar se kiya gaya he
 He who does not believe in duality accepts the cause of sorrow for himself
 koi praarabdh ko hi dukh kaa kaaran maanata he or koi karm ko hi dukh kaa nimitt samajhataa he
 Certain scholars consider nature and certain Gods to be the cause of sorrow
 atah he rajan! ab aap hi nishchit kijiye ki dukh kaa kaaran koun he
 " samraat parakshit us bail ke vachanon ko sun kar bole - "he vrishabh! aap avashya hi bail ke rup main dharm hai or yah gaurupini prithvi mata he
 You know the heart of religion very well
 aap kisi kii chugali nahin kar sakate isiliye aap dukh dene vaale kaa naam nahin bataa rahe hai
 o religion! Your tenacity, purity, mercy and truth were the four stages in the Satyuga
 treta main teen charan rah gayi, dwapar main do hi rah gayi or ab is dusht kaliyug ke kaaran aapkaa ek hi charan rah gaya he
 This unrighteous Kali Yuga is trying to destroy even that phase by its untruth
 bhagwaan shrikrishnachandra ke swadham gaman se dusht paapi shudra raja log is gaurupini prithvi ko bhogenge isi kaaran se yah mata bhi duhkhi hai
 " itnaa kah kar raja parikshith ne us paapi shudra rajveshadhari kaliyug ko maarane ke liye apni tikshn dhar vaali talwaar nikaali
 Kaliyug, fearful, took off his majestic dress and fell at the feet of King Parikshit and started saying tari-tahi
 raja parakshit bade sharnaagat vatsal the, unhone sharan main aaye huye kaliyug ko maarna uchit na samajha or kaliyug se kaha - "he kaliyug! tu mere sharan main aa gaya he isaliye maine tuje pranadan diya
 But only you are the root cause of wrongdoing, sin, lies, theft, treachery, poverty etc
 atah tu mere rajya se turant nikal ja or laut kar phir kabhi mat aana
 " raja parakshit ke in vachanon ko sun kar kaliyug ne kaatar vaani main kaha - "he rajan! aapkaa rajya to sampoorn prithvi par he, aapke rajya se baahar aisa koi bhi sthaan nahin he jahaan par ki main nivas kar sakun
 Hey Bhupathi! You are very kind, you have given me shelter
 ab dayaa karke mere nivas kaa bhi kuch na kuch prabandh aapako karnaa hi hoga
 " kaliyug is tarah kehane par raja parakshit soch main pad gayi
 After considering it, he said - "O Kali Yuga! Gaming, drinking, adultery and violence are inhabited by untruth, item, work and anger in these four places
 in chaar sthanon main nivas karne kii main tuje chhot detaa hoon
 "kali Yuga said this -" o Uttaranandan! These four places are insufficient for my residence
 dayaa karke koi or bhi sthaan mujhe dijiye
 "on asking for this kind of Kali Yuga, King Parikshit gave him the fifth place 'swarna'
 kaliyug in sthanon ke mil jane se pratyakshtah to vahaan se chalaa gaya kintu kuch dur jane ke baad adrushya rup main waapas aakar raja parakshit ke swarna mukut main nivas karne laga
 After this, he wandered a lot for the hunted prey and had a bad condition due to hunger and thirst

 But due to the good cremations of the king, he restrained himself from that sin

 The son of that Shamik Rishi, Shringiu was very strong and was bathing in the river at that time

 Zionism or totalism is the philosophical, religious or spiritual idea that the soul is not only in humans but also in all animals, flora, rocks, natural phenomena

 The philosophy of totalitarianism is found mainly in tribal societies, but it is also found in some sects of Shinto and Hindus
 aatma, jeevatma yaa jeev ke vishay main manushyon main praaia: teen prakaar ke vishwaas yaa vichaar prachlit rahe hai
 Some people, like the followers of Charvak, believe nothing independent of bodies or separate beings or spirits

 In logical language, animism is the principle according to which even the so-called root substances accept the existence of a non-physical element or power called soul or spirit and it is considered not only the basis of intellectual life of intellectual beings but also of physical or material actions

 Most thinkers of the modern era understand the fundamental belief not only of multi-theism but also of the virtuous monotheism of good human beings and count it in the religion or philosophy of uncivilized or half-castes
 unke anusaar sarvatmavaad maanav kii ek avaigyanik aasthaa maatr he
 They consider it an intellectual attempt to explain the facts of the world; But only initial or immature efforts

 Whose Divine Girl Come
 
 There was happiness in the whole house
 susawaani mata ji ghar ai
 
 sanwat baarah sau unnatees
 The age was between ten years
 
 Preparations for marriage choti kanya badi dulaari
 
 hua sambandh duggad parivaar
 Happiness has been immense
 
 Suswani when Bane Bethi
 ghatana ek ajab ho baithi
 
 ek musalmaa soobedaar
 Who made everyone smarter
 
 Suswani was a beautiful girl
 usne shaadi karne kii thaanee
 
 baat ye sunakar pita ghabaraaye
 How to fight with Muslims
 
 This relationship cannot be done
 soobedaar tha jid kaa pakkaa
 
 ajna paalan na karne par
 Thunderously threatened
 
 i will put the crusher in the crusher
 gin-gin kar sabko maaroonga
 
 seth satidas hindu khara tha
 Hindutva was filled in the vein
 dridhtaa se prastaav thukraayaa
 Subedar sent prison
 
 When the housemates came to know
 Then whipped Suswani ji
 
 When my mother became unhappy dukhi man tab hi prabhu ko dhyata
 
 nain moond arihant ko dhyaayi
 Dhyana came in meditation
 |swapn main tejasvi bhagwaan ne
 He gave a vision and said in the promise
 
 There is nothing to worry
 uski ye aukaat nahin he
 
 tu us dusht ko ye kahlaade 
 The condition is placed before you
 
 By giving a discount of seven feet
 peechha kar le ghode chadhakar
 
 wo tujko nahin pakad paayegaa
 You will get tired after running
 
 Where is the condition of the dream? mastak kesar tilak saje the
 
 soobedaar ko de sandeshaa
 The possibility of nothing happening
 
 There was happiness on both sides
 seth ko de di usne rihaai
 
 susawaani ji taiyaar khadi thi
 This was the time for examination
 
 Came to the gate before the race
 kunkum ke haath kaa chapa lagaai
 
 wo pathar main jyon kaa tyon he
 He represents the story of truth
 
 Saswani ji lost when tired
 raksha karne ko maan ko pukaari
 
 hui tab jor se akashwani
 Suswani sat on the lion
 
 When Morkhana of the race arrived
 mandir ke andar the shivaji
