 Today alloys with desired properties are made for any particular use
 dhaatuen jab kisi saamaanya vilyan, jaise amla, main ghulti he tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ko chhod detii hai or saadharantaya lavan banaati hai, kintu pighalaane par jab ve paraspar ghulti hai tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ke sahit rahati hai
 Such solid solutions of metals are called alloys
 anek mishradhaatuon main adhatuen bhi alp maatra main hoti hai, kintu sampurna kaa gun dhatvik rahata he
 Therefore, in 1939, the American Board of Examiners made the following definition of alloy - prarambh main mishradhatu kaa adhiktam upyog sikkon or aabhushanon ke banane main hota tha
 Copper, tin and zinc are 95 / 4 and 1 percent respectively in copper coins
 san 1920 tak england main chaandi ke sikke, 'sterling' chaandi ke banaae jate the, jisamen chaandi or tanba kramash: 92
5 or 7
5 pratishat hote the
 In the United States, silver and copper are 90 and 10 percent of all silver coins, respectively
 england ke sone ke sikken main sona or tanba kramash: 91
67 or 8
33 pratishat hote hai or america ke sone ke sikkon main sona 90 pratishat tathaa shesh anya dhaatuen, visheshkar tanba rahata he
 Platinum, gold and silver are used to add beauty to the colors of jewelery, to make them hard, strong and durable, or to mix them with other metals for sale at cheaper prices
 yah nishchay karnaa ki mishradhatuen saadhaaran mishran hai yaa rasinic yogic, ek jatil samasya he
 In some sense, these are chemical compounds, because when sodium succulents are made, then every piece of sodium in the cross causes a strong flame of light and the mercury becomes hot, a symptom of the compound being formed
 isi prakaar pighalate hue sone main jab aluminium dhaatu kaa ek tukdaa daalate hai, tab itani adhik ooshmaa utpann hoti he ki sampurna pighali hui dhaatu ujjwal prakashmay ho jaati he
 The color of many alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 udaahranarth, chaandi or jasta dona shwet rang ke hote hai, kintu inase jo mishradhatu banati he uskaa rang ati sundar gulabi hota he
 Gold is yellow and aluminum is white, but the color of their alloy is very shiny
 yah gun bhi yogicon kaa he
 On extracting the melting point of alloys, it is known that the behavior of alloys is of two types: The melting point of some alloys changes as the content of the metal changes, it is the property of the mixture and the melting point of some alloys is a constant temperature
 Occurs, indicating that alloys are compounds
 mishradhaatuon ke bhautik tathaa rasinic gun apni avyav dhaatuon ke gunon se bhinn hote hai or mishradhaatuon ke gun kisi bhi prakaar se avyav dhaatuon ke gunon ke madhya nahin hote
 This difference is due to the fact that when metals are melted together, they form many interconnected compounds and solid solutions
 mishradhatu kaa ghanatv apni avyav-dhaatuon ke madhya ghanatv se kam yaa adhik ho saktaa he
 The color of some alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 ye apni avyav dhaatuon se kathortar, kintu kam lacheelee tathaa ghaatvarghy or adhik bhangur hoti hai
 The melting point of alloys is always less than the melting point of the melting element at maximum temperature
 or praaia: nunatam taap par pighalanevaali avyav dhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 For example, an alloy containing lead, tin, bismuth and cadmium is faulted at 75 ° C, while the melting point of tin, the metallic ingredient at the lowest temperature, is 232 ̊c
 ye sab ve gun hai jinke kaaran mishradhatuen shuddh dhaatuon se adhik moolyawaan ho jaati hai tathaa udyog main adhik upyogi siddh hoti hai
 As a result of detailed study of the organization and crystalline composition of alloys by the fruits mentioned above and by microscopes, X-ray spectral measurements, thermal and chemical analysis and other physical tests, alloys are placed in three categories
 yah vibhaajan mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuon ke parmaanuon kaa samooh kis prakaar se sangathit he, uske aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 These three categories are the following: is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuen jab pighali hui hoti hai, tab ve ek duusare main ghuli hui rahati hai, kintu thos hone par dhaatuon ke crystal alag-alag ho jate hai, arthath dhaatuen paraspar aviley hai
 In this way, the alloy is a mixture of pure crystals of each element metal, and on cooling, one element separates the metal into solid form
 udaahranarth, ek taral mishradhatu, jisamen matraanusaar 10 bhaag sisa or 90 bhaag tin hote hai, jab thandi kii jaati he tab shuddh tin ke crystal pratham usee prakaar se pruthak hote hai jis prakaar shuddh him ke crystal chini ke tanu vilyan main se thanda karne par pruthak hote hai
 The temperature at which tin crystals begin to separate is lower than the melting point of pure tin
 tin ke galnaank ko jab usamen sisa ghulaa rahata he, gyaat kar sise kaa anubhaar usee niyam dwaara nikaalte hai jis niyam se pani main ghuli vaston kaa anubhaar nikaalte hai
 By this method, several molecules of those metals have been extracted, which remain as separate atoms in the diluent solution
 sisa-antimony mishradhatu mishran shrenee kii he
 Antimony is brittle and lead soft
 mudran dhaatu sisi, antimony or atyant kam maatra main tin kii mishradhatu he
 This alloy has the hardness of antimony, but it is not as brittle as that
 is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main ek avyav dhaatu ke parmaanu duusari avyav dhaatu ke crystalia dhaanche main bhalee-bhanti baith jate hai
 There are two different types of alloys of solid solution: tanba-nikal kii anek mishradhatuen jinka mahatvapurn upyog he, thos vilyan kii shrenee main aati hai
 For example, alloys from which nickel coins, rifle bullets and a wire have high electrical resistance are made
 canada ke bahut se khanijon main tanba or nikal ke sulphide hote hai, jinako galane se ek mishradhatu milti he
 It contains nickel and copper 67 and 28 percent and the remaining five percent contains iron and manganese respectively
 is mishradhatu ko monelle dhaatu kehete hai
 It is more tensile, flexible and corrosion resistant
 saadhaarant: dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar yogic nahin banaatin, kintu ooshmaa vishleshan dwaara gyaat hua he ki dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar bahut adhik sankhya main yogic banaati hai
 The class name of these compounds is interstitial compound
 is prakaar ke sabase adhik yogic kshar or kshareey mitti kii dhaatuen, aavart sarini ke visham upavirgo kii dhaatuon ke saath sanyog karke, banaati hai
 The amount of metals in these compounds is reflected by chemical formulas
 in sutron ke adhyayan se gyaat hota he ki is prakaar ke yogic sanyojaktaa ke un sab niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hai jo dhaatu tathaa adhatu ke sanyog se bananevaale yogicon dwaara pratipaadit hue hai
 For example, sodium, tin and lead are chemically reacted to form the following compounds: anek antaradhaatuk yogic bahut sthaayee hote hai or apane galnaank se adhik taap par garam karne se bhi apni avyav dhaatuon main vighatit nahin hote
 These compounds dissolve in liquid ammonia and thus the solution prepared is an electronegative
 jab inkaa vaidyut apghaton kiya jaataa he, tab ek avyav dhaatu, jo duusari kii apeksha nune dhanvidyuti hoti he, dhanagar par jamati he or duusari runagra par
 There is no theoretical explanation as to why interstitial compounds are formed
 keval itnaa hi pratipaadit ho paaya he ki ve dhaatuen, jinke gun ek se hai, ek duusare ke saath sanyog nahin karti hai
 Since these types of alloys are hard, brittle, very less tensile and flexible, only a few of these are useful
 sab mishradhaatuon ko saadharantaya louh tathaa aloh mishradhaatuon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 When iron is the base metal in the alloy, then that iron and when the base metal is any other metal, then it is called non-ferrous alloy

 WALL-E EVE, jise vanaspati jivan ke sanket kii khoj kaa nirdesh diya gaya tha, ke prem main pagal ho jaataa he
 Initially, EVE was different and foe, but gradually a sense of WALL-E developed and she liked it

 The captain then sends WALL-E along with EVE for cleaning

 WALL-E ko mukt karke EVE paudhe ko holo-sansuchak main rakh detii he or yaan ko prithvi main waapas bhej kar WALL-E kii body ko marammat ke liye uske ghar le jaati he
 EVE successfully re-activates him, but unfortunately wall-e's memory and personality is erased as he rejoins his original job of collecting trash
 maayoos EVE ne uskaa haath apane haathon main liya or use ek chumban diya, jisase use ek aisa jhatka laga ki apratyaashit rup se vah apane saamaanya rup main waapas aa gaya, donon robot khush hokar phir se mil jate hai
 WALL-E and EVE reunite humans and robots and work together to return the Earth to its former state and take care of it to plant the germination that brings them back to their home
 aabhaar jataane ke dauraan, prithvi ko phir se harabhra dikhaane ke liye kala ke vibhinn roopon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, jisaki shuruuaat misr ke gupha chitrakaari hyrogliphics or unani suraahi se da vinci ke rekhachitron tak or ant main prabhaavvaad se hoti he
 The art shows that the city is being rebuilt as a completely green world with grass, plants and animals
 manushya bhi apane vaastavik shaareerik sanrachana main laut laaye hai
 The final scene shows the film as WALL-E and EVE standing near a tree, the same tree that began to resettle the Earth
 BACK ON M-O AND WALLY M-O just finishes cleaning the floor
wally is fascinated
impishly makes another mark
m-o compulsively cleans it
 Can’t resist

 In 1994, Andrew Stanton conceived WALL-E with his fellow writers John Laster, Pete Doctor, and Joe Rannft during their dinner
 twoy story puraa honevaala tha or lekhakon ke dimag main agle project – e bag’sa life, monstors, ink
 or fiding nemo - kaa idia dopaher ke khaane ke samay haul maar rahaa tha
 Stanton asked, "what if mankind has to leave Earth and forget to stop the last robot?" Staunton, who spent years building the characters to make Toy Story attractive, had an impressive Robinson Crusoey idea for a lonely robot settled in a deserted planet
 stanton ne WALL-E ko kachra ikattha karanevaala banaaya, chunki idia ekadam se saaf tha or kyonki yah doum darje kaa kaam tha, isliye use sahanubhuti mili
 Stanton also liked the imaginary rubbish cube
 unhen yah idia bahut bekaar nahin laga, kyonki unke liye ek grah kaa kachare se pat jane jaise aapadaa kii kalpana bahut bachakaani thi
 Two months into 1995, Stanton and Pete Doc developed the film under the title Trash Planet, but had no idea how to develop the story and Doc chose to direct Monsters Inc
 instead
 WALL-E ko ek paudha milane kaa vichaar stanton ko aata he, kyonki ek nirjan vishwa main uske akele jivan se stanton ko footpath main panpate paudhe kii yaad aa jaati he
 Before they focus on other projects, Stanton and Lasseter get the idea to fall in love with WALL-E, as this was the necessary link to break out of loneliness
 finding nemo puraa karne ke baad stanton ne 2002 main phir se WALL-E likhnaa shuru kiya
 Stanton modeled the screenplay similar to Dan o'bannon's Alien
 stanton ne paaya ki o'benon ne apni patakatha is tarah likhi thi jisase hiku kii yaad aa jaati, jahaan kuch shabdon kii satat panktiyon ke jariye drishy varnan kiya gaya tha
 Stanton wrote the dialogues of the robot as traditional, but put them in parentheses
 2003 ke antim dinon main, stanton or kuch anya ne is film ke shuruaati bees minuton kii ek story reel kaa nirmaan kiya
 Lasseter and Steve Jobs were impressed and officially began work, although Jobs stated that he did not like the title, which was previously spelled "WAL-E
" jabaki stanton ke liye WALL-E kaa pehla krity "fail out of da ski" rahaa, haalanki ve pehle chaahate the ki prithvi kaa pataa lagane ke liye EVE ko eliens vahaan chhod jaaen or tab film bahut alag hoti
 WALL-E jab exiom aata he, tab vah spartkas kii tarah maanav jati ke avshesh ke viruddh roboton kaa vidroh karwaata he, ye avshesh krur alian jail the 
 james hiks naamak ek sharir vigyaani ne kshinta kii avadharana or antariksh main bahut zyada samay tak rahanevaale manushya par lambey samay tak bharaheenta ke prabhaav ke bare main stanton ko bataaya
 So, this was the impetus for mankind to become impure in the Alien prison, and his descent is revealed at the end of the Planet of the Apes style
 jail ek banaavati aspasht-si bhashaa main baat bhi karte hai, lekin stanton ne is vichaar ko radd kar diya kyonki unhone sochaa ki isse darshakon ko samajhane main badi mushkil hogi or ve aasaani se kahani se bhatak ja sakate hai
 The prison had a royal family, who host a dance in the palace on the lake behind the ship, and in the descent of this story the Axiom shrinks into a ball like a ball while returning to Earth
 stanton ne faisla kiya ki yah bahut hi vicitra or ankarshak he or unhone maanavtaa kii kalpana "big bebies" ke rup main kii 
 stanton ne phir se khadey hone or "paripakv hone" ke liye lakshanik vishay ko viksit kiya, unhone chaha ki WALL-E kaa EVE ke rishte se maanavtaa prerit ho kyonki unhone mahasoos kiya ki bahut hi kam filmon ne yah pataa lagaaya he ki kaise swapn loukik samaaj astitv main aaye
 The process of depicting the descending humanity is very slow in the way it is displayed
 stanton ne pehle jells kii naak or kaan banane kaa faisla kiya, taaki darshak unhen pahchaan saken
 aakhirkaar, paatr main darshak khud ko dekh saken, isliye bhrun-jaisi avadharana par pahunchane tak anguliyaan, pair, kapade or anya visheshtaon ko joda gaya
 In a later version of the film, an auto docking bay arrives to take back eve's plant
 film kaa pehla kanve captain par rahaa, lekin stanton ne sochaa ki WALL-E ke drushtikon se alag jane kii shuruyaat karne main yah adhik jaldbaaji hogi
 As a tribute to Get Smart, the auto takes the plant and goes inside a room to a brain-like room inside the vehicle, where he sees in the video a detailed plan of cleaning up the earth over the years
 stanton ne ise hataa diya, taaki yah rahasy bana rahe ki EVE ke paas se paudha aakhir kyon le jaaya gaya
 The captain seemed goofy, but Stanton wanted to see him unopposed, otherwise he would have been non-sympathetic
 An example of how the first captain was shown to be a fool is that he was wearing his hat upside-down, fixing it before the auto was challenged
 parishkrut film main, usne sidhe-sade dhang se topi pahan rakhi he, exiom par apni puri kaman sthapit hone par vah vah use kasakar pahentaa he
 Initially, EVE was killed by an electric current by Auto, and is then quickly rescued by WALL-E from an ejection at the hands of a WALL-A robot
 uske baad prithvi se laaye ek cigarette liter main uski urja ikai ko pratisthapit karke vah use punerjeevit karata he
 Stanton changed this after a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show that EVE had changed his instructions to bring the plant to the captain after WALL-E had been repaired, and to open the holo-detector despite being injured
 WALL-E looks even more brave in trying
 Stanton changes the moment when he reveals his plant produced from a cell before the escape, which makes EVE happy and the two are happy to dance around the vehicle
 stanton mahasoos karte hai ki screening ke samay aadhe darshakon ko yakeen tha ki maanav prithvi par rah paane main asamarth honge or film ke ant ke baad unki mrityu ho jaaegi
 laghu film yor friend da rat ke nirdeshak gym capobianko ne samaapti credit anemeshan kaa srijan kiya, jisane kahani ko jari rakhaa- or puure itihaas ke vibhinn kalatmak utaar-chadhaav ko shailibaddh kiya- taaki ashaavadi rujhaan bana rahe
 Monsters Inc
 WALL-E is the most complex Pixar production after all, because it was about communicating the world and history
 pikur kii zyaadaatar filmein jahaan 75,000 storyboard kii thim, vahiin WALL-E ke liye 125,000 kii jarurat padi
 production diziner rafl egalstone prithvi ke pehle drishy kii prakaash vyavastha ko bahut romani karnaa chaahate the, jabaki doosraa drishy exiom kaa udhaas or nirjeev
 tisare drishy ke dauraan, exiom ke maahaul main dhire-dhire romani prakaash vyavastha kii gayi
 Pixar studied the cities of Chernobyl and Sofia to create a world of destruction; Art director Antony Kristov was from Bulgaria and recalled the problems of collecting garbage in Sofia
 egalstone ne WALL-E ko asurakshit mahasoos karaane ke liye prithvi par safedi prakshalit karvaa diya, taaki use tej dhoop se bachane ke liye dhoop kaa chashma lagane kii zarurat pade
 atyadhik tej roshni se lokation or adhik vyapak dikhne lagata he
 Because of the ambiguity, the garbage towers of the cubes begin to look very large, otherwise their shapes would have become invisible
 The dull yellowish-brown color of the Earth becomes subtly light pink and blue with the advent of EVE
 jis trek main WALL-E rahata he, uske andar jamaa kii gayi saamagree jab vah EVE ko dikhataa he, tab uske jamaa kiye gayi prakaash jal uthakar ek aamantran kaa vaataavaran bana dete hai, christmas vriksh kii tarah
 egalstone ne pile or hare rang se bachane koshish kii, taaki WALL-E -jisane tractor kaa anukaran karne ke liye pilaa rang nirmit kiya tha- nirjan prithvi main ghul-mil na jaay or paudha adhik pramukh bane
 Stanton also wanted the lighting to look realistic and reminiscent of science films of his youth
 unhone sochaa ki pikur ne finding nemo ke liye pani ke neeche ke drishyon ke liye prakruti vidya kaa upyog kiya, so unhone WALL-E ke liye antariksh main iskaa upyog karnaa chaha
 While revisiting some of his favorite fantasy science films, he realized that Pixar's films did not look like 70mm films, and in addition to barrel distortion, lens glare and annoying focus
 Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Dickins and Dennis Murren to consult on lighting and environments
 muren ne pikur ke saath kai maheene bitaye, jabaki dickins ne ek tok kii mejabani kii or unase do saptaah rahane kaa anurodh kiya gaya
 Stanton said that Muren's experiences worked in integrated computer animation in live-action settings, while Dickins helped him understand avoiding too much complexity in camera-functions and lighting
 1970 ke dashak ke painavijan camere kaa istemaal karke anemetaron ko is tarah madad kii gayi, jisase ve digital vaataavaran main aspasht prishthbhumi jaise haath ke kaam kii kami ko samaj saken or unka duharaav nahin karen
 The first lighting test for a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E involved a building, filming it using a 70mm camera, and then trying to replicate it in a computer
 stanton ne ek prabhaav ke rup main gas vaan saint kii filmon ke halake lens talab kiya, kyonki yah prayek close-ap ko antarangta ke saath srujit karata he
 Stanton chose angles for virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose while filming on a set
 stanton chaahate the ki exiom ' kaa interior shanghai or dubai jaisaa lage
 Eggleston studied nasa's paintings of the 1950s and '60s and the concept of Tomorrowland's art for the Axiom, to show a sense of optimism of the era
 stanton ne bataaya ki "sambhawatah hamen yahaan hamaari prishthbhumi main bahut ek jaisaa rahaa, usamen hamen tumoroland kii kami khalati rahi, dijaneyland jamaane dwaara jiskaa vaada hamase kiya gaya tha," or ham ek "jet pack" anubhav chaahate the
 Pixar also studied the Disney cruise line and traveled to Las Vegas, helping to understand artificial lighting
 egalstone ne santiyago kelatrova kii atyaadhunik or aaramdaayi vaastukala ko exiom kii dizin kaa aadhaar banaaya
 Egglestone divided the inside of the vehicle into three sections; The basic texture of the affordable class at the back resembles brown concrete, as well as the graphics of the bnl logo in red, blue and white
 In coach class 'S' shaped living / shopping venues were created, as people often see "what's around the corner"
 Stanton had been wanting many colorful symbols, but felt that this would trouble the audience, so he decided to go with Eggleston's original idea of putting large numbers of symbols
 saamne ke premier class ko ek bade jine-jaisaa spa banaaya gaya, jisame sirf firoza, kriim or pile-bhure rang kaa istemaal kiya gaya or jo captain ke garm kaaleen or lakdi ke kaksh tathaa chikne andhere pul kii ore jaataa he
 In order to keep pace with the artificial axiom, camera activity was modeled like a Steadycam
 halo, doli! se live ection footage ko dikhaane kaa nirnay karke stanton ne aitihaasik, saamaanya maanvon ko live ection footage main dikhaane ke drushtaant ko jari rakhaa, jabaki anemeshan ke jariye film ke baaki bhaag main unke foole hue vansh kaa srijan kiya gaya
 The use of live action proved to be a stepping stone for Pixar, as Stanton was working on plans to create his next project, Jaune Carter of Mars
 storyborder derek thompsan ne gaur kiya ki live ection kii shuruyaat karne kaa matlab yah hua ki film kaa baaki hissaa or adhik yathartwaadee dikhnaa chahie
 Eggleston said that if historical humans were animated and a little ridiculous, viewers would not understand how serious their degradation was
 stanton ne fred willard ko aitihaasik by en large CEO banaaya kyonki "main sochataa hum ki vah bahut hi adhik mithravat or nishthaheen car vikreta he
 "the CEO says" stay the course ", which Stanton used because he thought it was ridiculous
 in shots ke drishy prabhaavon ke liye audyogic prakaash or jaadu kaa upyog hua
 WALL-E remained undeveloped during the 1990s, partly because Stanton and Pixar were not quite sure about the lengthy feature film featuring a major character acting like Luxo Jr
 or R2-D2
 stanton ne bataaya ki cinema main do prakaar ke robot hai :tin manushya kii tarah ke "dhaatu twachaa vaale maanav", yaa laxo or R2 kii tarah "kaam karne vaali mashine"
 unhen doosraa vichaar "shaktishaalee" laga, kyonki isse darshakon ko khud kii tulana paatro ke saath karne kii prerana milti he, jaise ki ve shishuon or paaltu pashuon ke saath karte hai: "aap majaboor ho jate hai
 

 you almost can't stop yourself from saying 'oh, i think it's like me! Looks like it's hungry! i think it wants to hang out
 " unhone aage kaha, "ham darshakon ko yah vishwaas dilaanaa chaahate hai ki ve ek ansi mashin dekh rahe hai jisamen jivan he
 "the animators visited recycling centers to study machinery, they also met robot designers, went to nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to study robots, saw a recording of Mars Rover, and a bomb from the San Francisco Police Department
 The detection robot was brought
 unke pradarshan main sahajata ko pasand kiya gaya, unase bahut sari harakat karavaayi gayi taaki ve maanav jaise lagen
 Stanton wanted WALL-E to be like a box and EVE like an egg
 WALL-E kii stanton dwaara di gayi ankhen ek jodi doorabeen se prerit thi, stanton jab boston red sokes ke khilaaf ockland athletics kaa khel dekh rahe the tab unhen yah baat suujhi, is vichlan ke kaaran ve "puri ining nahin dekh paae
" nirdeshak ko baster kiton kii yaad aa gai or usne faisla kiya ki robot ke munh yaa naak nahin honge
 Stanton used a zoom lens to make WALL-E more sympathetic
 ralf egalstone ne gaur kiya ki is vaishishty se anemetaron ko adhik kaam karnaa pad jayega or unhone robot ko ek bachche jaisaa swabhaav de diya
 Pixar's study of waste compactors during visits to recycling centers inspired his body building
 unke tanks ke trades ek wheelchair se prerit the, jise viksit karke kisi ne pahiyon ke bajaay trades kaa istemaal kiya tha
 The animators wanted him to have elbows, but he felt that this would be unrealistic as he was designed to fill only the trash in his body
 jab unhone laharaakar uskaa pareekshan kiya to uske haath bahut kamjor lage
 Animation director Angus mclain suggested based on his father's designed inkjet printers that his hands be attached to the track on the side of his body so that they could be moved around
 haath kii is dizin ne paatr kii dasha ke nirmaan main yogadan kiya, so agar ve use nervas dikhaanaa chaahate, to ve use neeche kar dete the
 Stanton remained oblivious to the similarities between WALL-E and Johnny 5 of Short Circuit until others pointed him out
 stanton chaahate the ki EVE par praudyogiki kaa sabase ucch str aajamaaya jaay or unhone ypod diziner jonathan ive ko uski dizin kaa nirikshan karne ko kaha
 ve bahut prabhavit hue
 uski ankhen lit-brit khilone kii tarah banaayin gayin, lekin pikur unhen bahut adhik bhavpurn nahin bananaa chaahate the, kyonki isse badi aasaani se uski ankhen dil main utarkar prem kaa yaa aisa hi kuch kaa pradarshan kar sakati hai
 Because of her limited design, the animators had to treat her like a painting, relying on her physical posture to express emotion
 They found him like a manati or a white whale because his floating body resembled that of an underwater creature
 auto 2001: a spes odissi ke HAL 9000 ko ek sachet shradhanjali tha or captain or auto ke bich hui bhidnt ke liye also spraach zarathustra ke upyog ne ise or aage badhaayaa
 jis tarah vah ek diwaar se lataka hota he, isse use kisi makadi kii tarah ek ashanka mahasoos hui
 Originally, the auto's design was completely differentiated, similar to EVE, but masculine and authoritative; Steward robots were also made more aggressive patrol boats
 adhikansh robot kaa nirmaan bild-a-boat kaarykram ke tahat kiya gaya, jahaan sau se adhik vividhtaon main vibhinn sir, haath or trades ko ek saath mishrit kiya gaya
 Humans were made like sea lions due to their gross body, as well as babies
 The filmmakers noted that children's fat is much tighter than adults, and they copied this structure to the film's humans
 apane roboton ke anemeshan ke liye pikur ne lagbhag ek saal tak kiton or chaplin kii ek-ek film rojaanaa dekhi, or kabhi-kabhi herold loyad kii film bhi
 baad main, film nirmaataaon ne janaa ki sabhi bhaawanaaon kaa sampreshan khamoshi se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Stanton introduced Keaton's parable of the "great Stone Face", so that the characters were put to firmness while animating the characters for irreversible gestures
 After re-watching them, Stanton realized that the filmmakers — since the sound had emerged — were relying too much on dialogue to convey the details
 film nirmaataaon ne ek paaltu ke rup main rakhe WALL-E ke tilchatte ko "haal" naam pradaan kiya, mook film nirmaataa haal rosh ke sandarbh main 
 unhone 2001: a spes odissi, da blike stalian or nevar krai woolf filmein bhi dekhi, jinamein dhwani to thi magar samvaad par nirbhar nahin thim
 Stanton acknowledged the impact of Silent Running, as its silent robots were spearheaded by r2-d2's Sadrish, and Woody Allen of "hopeless Romantic" also inspired WALL-E
 nirmaataa gym morris ne WALL-E ke liye dhwani diziner ke rup main ben bart kii sifarish kii, kyonki stanton roboton ke liye R2-D2 ko maandand ke rup main istemaal kar rahe the
 Burt finishes his work with Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and tells his wife that he will no longer work for movies made on robots, but he calls the replacement of WALL-E and its sounds "new and exciting" 
 unhone film ke liye 2500 dhvaniyaan record kii, jo star vars film kii ausat maatra se duguni he, or unke karier kaa ek ricard he
 Burt began work in 2005, and experimented with the filtration of his voice for two years
 bart ne robot kii awaajon ko "nanhen bachche jaisi swar kii saarvbhaumik bhashaa" bataaya
 "'oh', 'hmm?', 'hah', you know?" nirmaan ke dauraan bart ko dijani ke anek gharelu clasik filmon ke dhwani diziner jimi mcdonald dwaara istemaal kii gayi saamagree ko dekhne kaa mauka mila
 Burt used many of mcdonald's material in WALL-E
 kyonki bart nirmaanotar kaary ke dauraan sirf dhwani prabhaavon ko hi nahin jod rahe the, balki anemetars unke nae srijan kaa hameshaa moolyankan bhi karte ja rahe the, jo bart ko ek asaamaanya anubhav laga
 They were working closely with the animators, returning the animation to them after adding the sound, giving them a greater imagination
 har paatr ke liye bart vaigyanik rup se sateek dhwani kaa chayan karnaa chaahate rahe, lekin agar ve nahin kar pate jo kaam aa sake, tab ve koi avastavik shor jaisi naatakeey dhwani kaa chayan karte
 paatro kii kala kii avadharana ko samajhate hue bart ne saikadon dhvaniyon kii talash kii, iske baad ve or stanton prayek robot ke liye kuch ko chhaantkar alag kar lete
 Burt saw a handheld power generator while watching Erin in the Sky and bought similar, unopened equipment from ebay on 1950 for use in moving WALL-E around
 WALL-E jab tej chalane lagata he tab ke liye bart ne ek automobile self starter kaa bhi istemaal kiya, or WALL-E ke sharir main sthit kachra ko compress karanevaale yantra ke liye unhone car ko nasht karne vaale vidhwans centre kii dhwani kaa upyog kiya
 To indicate that the WALL-E battery has been fully recharged, a mechanical computer chime was used
 EVE ke liye, bart chaahate the ki uski gunagunaahat sangitamay gunvattta kii ho
 Burt could only make out the middle or masculine voice, so Pixar employee Alyssa Knight was asked to give her voice so that Burt could make an electronic change
 stanton ne dhwani prabhaav ko paryaapt acha maanate hue sahi dhang se use wo bhoomika di
 Burt recorded the flight of a ten-feet-long radio-controlled jet aircraft for eve's flight, and for his plasma cannon, Burt hit an agile Hung from a ladder with a wagon
 star vars ke blaster ke shor ke ek "chachere bhai" ke rup main unhone ise varnit kiya
 Macine Talk was used because Stanton "wanted Auto Robot to be a model, voiceless, zeros and ones, mean and voiceless Stephen Hawkins sound that i think is absolutely right
" " use yantravat mahasoos karne ke liye paatr ke liye atirikt dhwani daali gayi, taaki yah dikhataa rahe ki vah hameshaa sochataa or gananaa karata rahata he
 Sigurney Weaver was cast as the voice of Yan's computer
 vivar kii bhoomika ko lekar stanton majaak karte hue kehete, "tumhen pataa he ki ab tum "maa" banane vaali ho?" film alian main yaan kaa computer "maa" he
 Burt visited the Niagara Falls in 1987 and during this time he made recordings of wind sounds
 retili aandhi ko record karne ke liye ek canvas bag uthaakar ek haul ke chaaron ore daudna padow wo drishy jahaan WALL-E girte hue shopping cart se batch nikalataa he, uske liye bart or unki beti ek supermarket gayi or apni cart main ek recorder rakhaa
 They hit him near the parking lot and let him fall down the hill
 haal ke palaayan kii aawaaj ke liye unhone achambhit hone kii dhwani or hathkadi kii aawaaj ko ek saath joda
 After successfully working together with Nemo, Thomas Newman once again joined Stanton for WALL-E, Nemo won Newman an Annie Award for Best Music in an Animated Film
 unhone 2005 main swar lipi lekhan shuru kiya, is ummid main ki yah kaary pehle shuru karne se unhen taiyaar film main shaamil hone ke liye adhik samay mil paaegaa
 lekin, newman ne gaur kiya ki anemeshan samay-suchi par itnaa adhik nirbhar he ki unhen or pehle tab kaam shuru karnaa chahie tha jab stanton or riordon ne patakatha likh rahe the
 The episode of EVE was arranged for the first time in October 2007
 jab vah pehle-pahal prithvi ke aasapaas ud rahi hoti he, uske is prakaran ke liye mul rup se adhik arcestra tatwon kaa istemaal kiya gaya or newman ko adhik strain aawaaj daalane ke liye protsaahit kiya gaya
 Newman said that Stanton had many ideas on how he wanted the music to sound, and that he usually followed it because he found that the vocal script for a partially silent film was difficult
 stanton puri swar lipi ko arcestra ke saath chaahate rahe, lekin newman ne is vichaar ko jaraa simit karne kii zarurat mahasoos kii, visheshkar exiom main sawari ke drishyon main or yahaan unhone electronics kaa istemaal kiya
 Stanton originally wanted the French swing music of the 1930s to be played at the first shots of space, but he saw The Triplets of Belleville and did not want to be seen copying it
 tab stanton ne halo, doli! ke geet "put on yor sande cloths" ke bare main sochaa, is par 1980 ke ek ucch vidhyalay nirmaan main unhone khaas sahyogi barnabi takar kaa abhinay kiya tha
 Stanton finds that the song is on two naïve young boys looking for love, which resembles wall-e's own hope of companionship
 gym riordon ne suzav diya ki WALL-E ko video main film mil jaati he or stanton "it only tex a mument" or haathon main haath daale abhinaytaon kii clip ko shaamil kar lete hai, kyonki ve chaahate the ki WALL-E kis tarah prem ko samajhataa he or EVE ko is bare main bataata he, ise drishy ke jari bhi dikhaaya jaay
 halo, doli ! sangeetkaar jeri harman ne geet kaa upyog karne kii anumati de di, yah jane bina hi ki uskaa bhala kya istemaal hone vaala he; or jab unhone film dekhi to iske samavesh ko "pratibhashali" bataaya
 Coincidentally, Newman's uncle Lionel said hello, dolly! Worked for newman ne stanton ke pasandida sangeetkaaron main ek peter gabrial ke saath aabhaar geet "down tu arth" kii rachana ke liye landan kii yatra kii
 Later, Newman remodeled some of the film's vocal script to include the song's composition, so it would not be a slang when shown
 louis armastrang ke "laa vie en roj" ke prastutikaran kaa istemaal ek montaj ke liye kiya gaya, jahaan WALL-E prithvi par EVE kaa dhyaan aakarshith nahin kar paata he
 As the two robots dance around the Axiom, this use of Bing Crosby's "stardust" was specified in the screenplay, but Newman wanted the scene's script to be its own
 One such major change occurred for the scene in which WALL-E tries in various ways to awaken EVE; Originally, it was intended to play Montaz with an instrumental musical version of "raindrops Keep Falling on My Head", but Newman wanted to challenge himself and created an original vocal script for the scene
 stanton ne film ke vishay kaa varnan is prakaar kiya, "ataarkik prem se jivan kii programing kii paraajay hoti he"
 i had the feeling that through these two programmed robots, i wanted to show what they meant by life, try to find out


 how they were created, without knowing it, they would go against it with irrational love Fall into 

mujhe ehsaas hua ki yah vaastavik jivan ke liye ek adarsh roopak he
 We are stuck in our habits, our routines and our leaks in order to escape from life unknowingly
 gadabadi vaale bhaag se bachane kii koshish karte hai
 Avoid forming relationships with other people
 apane bagal ke vyakti se sampark banane se bachate hai
 That is why we can all live with our cell phones and do not keep transactions with each other
 i thought, 'this is a perfect extension of the whole issue of the film
' i wanted to go on with science in such a way that it would all emerge logically
 stanton ne dhyaan diya ki kai tippaneekaron ne maanavtaa ke shishtachar ke paryaavarniya pahalu par jor diya he, kyonki "wo algaav ek kaaran banane ja rahi he, paroksh rup se, jivan main jo kuch ho rahaa he vah maanavtaa yaa grah ke liye karaab he
 "stanton said that by taking away the effort to work, robots are also taking away humanity's need for an effort to build relationships
 isai patrkaar rod drehar ne praudyogiki ko film ke ek jatil khalanaayak ke rup main dekha
 exiom main manushya kii kritrim jivan style unhen prakruti se alag kar detii he, "unhen praudyogiki or apni buniyadi pravriti donon kaa gulam banaati he or isse ve wo sab kho dete hai jo unhen maanav banaata he
 "dreher compared the hard-working, scruffy WALL-E with Yan's clean-cut robots
 baharhaal, yah robot nahin balki maanav hi hai jinhone unhen atishay banaaya or ant main aabhaar ke dauraan manushya or robot ko prithvi ke navinikaran main ek duusare ke saath kaam karte dikhaaya jaataa he
 "WALL-E is not an anti-tech film," he said
 “it does not demonize technology
 iskaa sirf itnaa kahana he ki maanav kii sachhee prakruti ke vikaas main praudyogiki kaa upyog kiya jaay- yah bhi ki maanavtaa kii samruddhi main ise adhinsth hona hi chahie or is disha main badhane main madadgaar hona chahie
" Stanton, who is a Christian, named EVE from the Biblical character because wall-e's loneliness reminds him of Adam, whose wife God created later
 drehar ne EVE ke bible naam par gaur kiya or uske nidesh ko kahani kaa ek vyutkram mana; EVE paudhe kaa istemaal karke maanavtaa ko prithvi par laut jane or "jhuthe bhagwaan" bnl se or uski di sust jivan style se dur ho jane ko kahati he
 Dreher also considered it a deviation from the traditional Christian point of view, where Adam cursed labor, while WALL-E states that hard work is what makes humans human

 WALL-E compared himself to Prometheus, Sisyphus, and Butadès: In an essay WALL-E described himself as representative of Pixar's artistic endeavor, Hrag Varthenian compared WALL-E to Butadès in a scene where The robot creates an idol out of spare parts to express his love for EVE

 American Conservative Patrick J
 Ford said that wall-e's skeptical critics ignored the film's lesson, believing it to be an urge for traditional conservatism
 He argued that mass consumerism in the film was not the product of big business, but business and a very close relationship between the big government is shown: "the government unilaterally provides its citizens with everything they need and can afford

 Reflective Stanton stated that he was not disappointed when the film was banned for Best Animated Film nomination because he was overwhelmed by the film's positive reception and finally said "rekha is just getting so vague that i think That every year it is getting harder and harder to tell which is an animated movie and which is not an animated movie
 " WALL-E performed well in late 2008 in various awards categories, particularly in the Best Picture category, where animated films are often overlooked

 All theoretical and applied aspects of measurement are studied in metrology or metrology
 yah maapan evam uske anuprayogon kaa vigyaan he
 Metrology is the branch of physics in which we have knowledge about pure measurement
 maapvigyaan main mul rup se ham teen rashiyon, arthath dravyaman, lambaai evam samay ke bare main charchaa karte hai or inhen teen raashiyon ke gyaan se ham anya raashiyon, jaise ghanatv, aaytan, bal tathaa shakti aadi ko maapte hai
 Non-invariant standards are not only instructed by metrology, but they are also upheld
 inhen maanakon dwaara ham vastuon ke gunon kii maap tathaa tulana bhi karte hai
 The other side is that keeping in view a particular function, metrology provides ways in which comparisons can be made to a very high degree of accuracy
 aadhunik vigyaan tathaa udyogon main uparyukt moulik tulanaaon kaa atyant shuddh hona aavashyak he
 The measurement is not completely correct and there is always some experimental error in it
 aajkal maapvigyaan kii adhik moulik kriyaaon main yatharthata kii nimnlikhit sannikatataayen praapt he: Compared to two platinum iridium samples of international standard kilograms: one part per 10,00,00,000

 tarang dairghy prakritik maanak ke rup main -- baad kii pragati ne kaaphi had tak hamaari manyataon main parivartan laa diya he
 First, scientist Michelson's experiments established a natural standard, the wavelength of, which is unanimously assumed that this standard is reproducible with at least as high a level of accuracy as is found in comparisons of fluid parameters
 lekin is maanak kii sarvotkrisht visheshta yah he ki yah dirghakaalik vicharan kii sambhaavna se pare he, jabaki anya sabhi prakaar ke maanakon kaa hi prayog hota he
 In any part of the earth, we can verify fluid parameters with the help of this natural standard
 yadi dravyatmak maanakon ko antarrashtriya kendriya prayogshaala main bhejkar adiprarup meter se tulana karaani hoti he, to avaagaman main use haani pahunchne kii sambhaavna rahati he, kintu prakritik maanak kii sahaayta se ham apni hi prayogshaala main yah kaary kar sakate hai
 The second is that such reforms led to the development of flat-headed standards
 aajkal aise dand bhi prapya hai jinke sire ekadam samaantar hai
 The lengths of such punishments are derived directly from optical interference rather than from the linear standard
 micelson ke vyatikaranmaapi kaa upyog is baat ko jaanane main bhi kiya gaya ki ek maanak meter main kitni prakaash kii tarangen aati he tathaa unki sankhya kya he? micelson ne 150 centegrade taap tathaa 760 mimi0 vayumandal ke dabaav par antarrashtriya meter kaa, jo paris ke paas maap or taul ke antarrashtriya santhaan main rakhaa hua he, maan cadmium kii laal taragon main, gyaat kiya
 This value is 15,53,163

 fabri paro ke baad ke prayogon se gyaat hua ki 15° sein0 tathaa 760 millimetre dabaav par shushk hawa main ek meter main yah sankhya 15,53,164

 If Michaelsson's experiments are modified to have the effect of water vapor, it is clear that there is no difference in the value of the two
 is baat kaa pramaan he ki dravyatmak maanak gaj apane nirmaankaal se lekar aaj tak sabhavat: 0
0002 inch ghat chukaa he, lekin jahaan tak antarrashtriya adiprarup meter kaa sawaal he vah aparivartit rahaa he
 The experiments of Michelson and Fabry Para have also proved this
 inaki tulana kaa aadhaar cadmium kii laal rekha thi
 All standard meters of matter are made of an alloy, which consists of 90% platinum and 10% metal called iridium
 is prakaar main metron ko aadharbhoot maanakon ke liye sabase santoshprad mana jaataa he
 In many works, where the problem of very accurate measurement arises, it is necessary that we treat such a material whose thermal expansion is nominal
 aisi dhaatuon kii khoj ho chuki he tathaa inamen se ek ko 'invaar' kehete hai
 It is a alloy of nickel and steel, which contains 36% nickel
 duusari mishradhatu ko stable invaar kii sangya di gai he
 It also contains little chromium
 is mishradhatu main saadhaaran invaar kii apeksha yathesht kam prasar hota he, to bhi isko achar ke rup main nahin mana ja saktaa
 The second material is fused silica, whose diffusion coefficient is very low
 yah dravya ek degree sein0 taap badhane par keval 0
4 ́10-6 badhata he
 The standard meter of fused silica is the shape of a tube, with parallel banding at the end
 iske platinikrut tal par simaankit rekhaayen khudi hoti he
 As far as this standard is known, there has been no change in its length
 chunki is prakaar kaa maanak bahut hi najuk hota he, isaliye na to ise moulik nirdesh maanak ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya or na iskaa prachlan dainik kaaryon main hua
 It is used only in metrology laboratories

 It is known to all of us that in the search for radioactive substances it was previously considered an essential stable property of samhita or mass substance
 batkhron kii sanhati yaa dravya maanak main parivartan kii ashanka apgharshan, oxikaran tathaa ardratagrahi avasorana ke kaaran hi sambhav he
 If the standards of liquids are conserved and used with due care, they exhibit considerable load stability
 bhaar kaa aadharbhoot maanaknirdesh platinum tathaa iridium mishradhatu kaa bana he
 This alloy has been used in the manufacture of 'state standard pound' and 'international etc
 type kilogram'
 kai varshon ke baad jab kilogram kii vibhinn rashtriya pratiyon kii pun: tulana kii gai, to yah gyaat hua ki sthirataa kaa str 108 main ek bhaag tak he
 This reflects not only the accuracy of the standards but also the completeness of comparisons
 ek doosraa dravya, jisamen sanhati kii ucch str kii sthirataa pai jaati he, crystal quartz kehalaata he
 The errors in this are that its density is relatively low and it is absorbent
 hawa main sanhati ke maanakon kii tulana karte samay ye maanak vaayu ke vibhinn aaytanon ko hataate hai
 Therefore, consideration of upper buoyancy effect must be taken in comparing the standards of the code
 yadi maanak kaa ghanatv kam hoga, to utplavan sanshodhan zyada hoga
 The accuracy achieved in comparison to platinum-iridium standards is based on the fact that their density is not only very high but very close
 iske kaaran utplavan sanshodhan bahut hi kam hota he
 Buoyancy modification arises as a problem in comparison to weights whose density varies greatly, such as platinum, quartz, and brass, etc
 is dosha ko dur karne ke liye vayurahit vaataavaran main taulnaa aavashyak he
 In daily business activities, weighing is done in the air and the difference due to buoyancy in the weights and goods is negligible from the business point of view
 nireekshak vyapaarik baaton kii tulana ke liye pital ke, jiskaa ghanatv 8
143 he, baaton ke maanak kaam main laate hai
 Even when we do not weigh in an airless environment, the balance of the bent should be good, the method of application should be efficient and alert for proper comparison of the primary parameters of mass
 tula ke shunya pathnaank ko sthir rakhane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki tapasthirataa main atyant saavdhaanee barti jaay
 Therefore, the room in which the balance is kept, it is necessary to control the temperature in a structural manner and the inspector should do the weighing work from outside the room, or it should be weighed from some distance
 baaton ko kaam main laane kaa kaary tula ke baahar se yantric niyantran dwaara, yaa lambii chhadon se chalaakar, kiya janaa chahie
 The movement of the pedicle of the Libra must be viewed either through a telescope or at the scale of a light beam reflected from the pedestal across the scale
 taap kaa prabhaav tula par kam se kam ho, isaliye yah aavashyak he ki invaar kii tandi vyavhaar main laai jaay, kint invaar kuch had tak chumbakeey he
 If a very high degree of purity is required, it is necessary that the pedicle of the weft is completely disguised by magnetic effects and the weigher is placed in an iron box
 choti choti matraaon ko taulne ke liye or vishesh kar gaison ke ghantvon kii tulana main, sookshm tula prayog main laai jaati he, jo purnataya balit quartz kii bani hoti he
 Even 1 / 10 gram has been weighed up to the purity of one part in 108 by this type of weighing

 But do you know what is the history of Ram Navami? The festival of Ram Navami has been celebrated for the last several thousand years
 ram navami kaa tyohaar bhagwaan vishnu ke saatven avatar bhagwaan ram ke janm diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 According to the epic Ramayana, King Dasaratha of Ayodhya had three wives but for a long time no king was able to give the happiness of children to Dasaratha
 jisase raja dasharath bahut pareshaan rahete the
 In order to have a son, Rishi Vashistha gave the idea to perform a Kamaishti Yajna to King Dashrath
 iske pashchaat raja dasarath ne maharishi rushaya sharunga se yajna karaayaa
 After finishing the yagna, Maharishi gave one bowl of kheer to the three wives of Dashrath

 a change in the density of the surface state near the tip changes the tunnel current
 iske chaalan ke do prakaar hai - yaa to dhara ko sthiraank rakhaa jaye, yaa nok kii duuri ko sthiraank rakhaa jaye
 In a constant current system, distance is controlled with the help of a current so that the current does not change

 Blue Mahadanva stars are those Mahadanava stars which are 'O' or 'B' category stars
 inamen aam taur par 10 se 50 saura dravyaman kaa dravyaman hota he or inkaa ardhavyas 25 saura ardhavyas tak ho saktaa he
 These are the hottest and brightest stars of the universe and are found only in small numbers
 nile mahadaanav laal mahadaanvon se chote akar ke hote hai
 Because they have a very short lifespan, they are found only in young celestial groups, such as in the arms of spiral galaxies, clumsy galaxies, and open galaxies
 It is rarely seen in the centers of spiral galaxies, oval galaxies, and round galaxies, because the structures are prepared only after a very long period of construction, and the blue supergiant is consumed for that long
 nile mahadaanav kaa ek bada mashhuur udahaaran shikari taramandal main sthit rijal he jisamen suraj se 20 guna dravyaman or 60,000 guna chamak he
 The number of blue supergiant may be small, but their brightness is such that many can be seen from the earth without binoculars
 bahut bade aakaar ke taare aksar apni mrityu ke qareeb aakar nile mahadaanav ban jate hai
 Nuclear reactions in such stars slow down and the star shrinks
 iskaa nateeja yah hota he ke ab ek pehle se kai choti akar kii sataha se pehle ke lagbhag baraabar urja nikal rahi hoti he jis se us sataha kaa taapmaana bahut bad jaataa he
 The same happens with the red supergiant whose nuclear reactions slow down
 laal mahadaanvon se har samay ek ghani gas kii aandhi nikalati rahati he jo apane ghaneypan kii vajah se bahut dhimi raftaar rakhti he
 In contrast, a less dense but very strong thunderstorm emanates from the blue supergiant
 jab koi laal mahadaanav nila mahadaanav banataa he to nile mahadaanav kii tej andhi puraane laal mahadaanav kii dhimi aandhi se ja takaraati he or ek gas kaa jamaavada taare ke ird-gird ek maheen gole ke rup main ban jaataa he
 Almost all the blue Mahadanavas have been seen around such shells, which is proof that all of them were once Red Mahadanavas

 Sankhya is also one of the six types of Indian philosophy which was very popular and famous in ancient times
 yah advait veydant se sarvatha vipareet manyataayen rakhane vaala darshan he
 The original person who founded it is called Kapil
 'sankhya' kaa shabdic arth he - 'sankhya sambandhi' yaa vishleshan
 Its most prominent belief is that the creation is made up of the nature man, here nature is the root and the male conscious
 yoga shastron ke urja strot, shakton ke shiv-shakti ke siddhant iske samaanaantar dikhte hai
 Sankhya philosophy once held a very high place in Indian culture
 desh ke udaatt mastishk sankhya kii vichaar paddati se sochate the
 The Mahabharata has even said that if knowledge comes, then there are few numerical figures, Mahanmahatma
 vastut: mahabharat main darshanik vichaaron kii jo prishthbhumi he, usamen sankhyashastra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The ideas of Samkhya Darshan have been mentioned in many poetic and interesting ways at many places of Shanti festival
 sankhya darshan kaa prabhaav gita main pratipaadit darshanik prishthbhumi par paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 One of the reasons for its popularity has been that this philosophy has resolved the contrast seen in life in a beautiful manner by repudiating the trinitarian nature as omnipresent
 sankhyacharyon ke is prakruti-kaaran-vaad kaa mahaan gun yah he ki pruthak-pruthak dharm vaale sat, rajas tathaa tamas tatwon ke aadhaar par jagat kii vishmata kaa kiya gaya samaadhaan bada buddhigamya prathit hota he
 By not considering any temporal problem as the law of God, the reason for deteriorating the synergy of these forms and not making effort of the creatures
 yani, sankhya darshan kii sabase badi mahanata yah he ki isamen sristi kii utpatti bhagwaan ke dwaara nahin maani gayi he balki ise ek vikasaatmak prakriya ke rup main samajha gaya he or mana gaya he ki sristi anek anek avasthaaon se hokar guzarane ke baad apane vartmaan swaroop ko praapt hui he
 Kapilacharya is considered by many to be an atheist but this notion has been denied in texts like Bhagavad Gita and Satyarthraprakash
 sankhya-darshan kaa mukhya aadhaar satkaryawad he
 According to this theory, work cannot originate without reason
 faltah, is jagat kii utpatti shunya se nahin kisi mul satta se he
 This theory is contrary to Buddhist nihilism
 kaary, apni utpatti ke purna kaaran main vidyaman rahata he
 Work is the essence of its cause
 kaary tathaa kaaran vastutah samaan prakriya ke vyakt-avyakt rup hai
 Matrimonialism has two distinctions - consequentialism and discourse
 parinamwad se taatpary he ki kaaran vaastavik rup main kaary main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Like in sesame oil, milk is converted into curd

 Like the feeling of a snake in a rope
 sankhya darshan prachinkaal main atyant lokapriy tathaa prathit hua tha
 Sankhya philosophy once held a very high place in Indian culture
 desh ke udaatt mastishk sankhya kii vichaar paddati se sochate the
 The Mahabharata has even said that if knowledge comes, then there are few numerical figures, Mahanmahatma
 vastut: mahabharat main darshanik vichaaron kii jo prishthbhumi he, usamen sankhyashastra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The ideas of Samkhya Darshan have been mentioned in many poetic and interesting ways at many places of Shanti Parva
 sankhya darshan kaa prabhaav gita main pratipaadit darshanik prishthbhumi par paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 In fact, Sankhya philosophy became very popular at some time
 isaki lokapriyata ke or chaahe jo bhi kaaran hon par ek to yah avashya rahaa prathit hota he ki is darshan ne jivan main dikhaai padane vaale vaishamy kaa samaadhaan trigunatmak prakruti kii sarvakaaran rup main pratishtha karke bade sundar dhang se kiya
 The great quality of this nature-cause-debate of Sankhyacharyas is that the solution of the illusions of the world on the basis of the elements of different religions, Rajas and Tamas elements, seems to be very just and wise
 "sankhya" shabd kii nishpatti "sankhya" shabd ke aage anu pratyay jodne se hoti he or sankhya shabd kii vyutpatti saarchaksh dhaatu khyan darshain pratyay taap he, jiske anusaar iskaa arth samyak khyaati, sadhu darshan athwa satya gyaan he
 This due fame of the Sankhyacharyas, this true knowledge of them, lies in the separation of the male form of the Chitta element from the person's form and the dual aspect of the person
 upar-upar se prapanch main sanaa hua dikhaai padane par bhi purush vastut: usase achoota rahata he
 In spite of being seen as indulgent or indulged in it, one remains virtually unattached or uninterested - this greatest philosophical discovery of the Sankhyakaris is treated in his own words by the names Satvapurushanyakhyati, Vivek Khyati, Prakritik Vigyan, etc
 isi vivek gyaan se maanav jivan ke param purusharth yaa lakshya kii siddhi maanate hai
 Thus "number" is an abbreviation to reveal the true form of the greatest philosophical discovery of the word numerology, being the first lecturer, his ideology was named as "samkhya" in very ancient times
 gananarthak "sankhya" shabd se bhi "sankhya" shabd kii nishpatti maani jaati he
 In the Mahabharata, both these types of expressions have been revealed in a verse about Sankhya
 vah is prakaar he- sankhyan prakurvate chaiv prakrutin c prachakshate
 Tattvānti Ch Chatuvinsdān Ten Samkhya: Prakritita:
 iskaa shabdaarth yah he ki jo sankhya arthath prakruti or purush ke vivek gyaan kaa upadesh karte hai, jo prakruti kaa prabhaav pratipaadan karte hai tathaa jo tatwon kii sankhya choubees nirdhaarit karte hai, ve sankhya kahe jate hai
 Some people are of the opinion that the secondary goal of the word "number" in the form of knowledge is considered to be the attainment of Kaivalya or salvation, the ultimate goal of life from the wisdom of nature and man, hence the attainment of that knowledge is the main and For this reason, the whole force of Samkhya is on him
 sankhya choubees tatv maanata he, yah to ek saamaanya tathy kaa kathan maatr he, at: gaun he
 Udayveer Shastri in his treatise entitled "history of Samkhya Darshan" quotes the interpretation of Sridhar Swami on Bhagavata 3-25-1 in being propounded by Kapila of the Samkhya Shastra - the interpreter explaining the last verse clearly It is written - Element number numerator: Sankhya-promoter Ityarth:
 isse nishchit ho jaataa he ki yahi kapil sankhya kaa prarvatak yaa praneta he
 Scribe of Sridhar Swami: On the word, Shastri ji has written in the footnote given below - Some interpreters of the medieval period have interpreted the word "sankhya" in the term "sankhya" as calculative
 vastut: iskaa arth tatv gyaan he
 But considering it deeply, it is not as common or secondary as it seems to be an emergency
 aisa prathit hota he ki bahut pracheen kaal main darshanik vikaas kii praarambhik avasthaa main jab tatwon kii sankhya nishchit nahin ho pai thi, tab sankhya ne sarvapratham is drishyman bhautik jagat kii sookshm mimasaa kaa prayaas kiya tha jiske falswaroop uske mul main vartmaan tatwon kii sankhya saamanyat: choubees nirdhaarit kii thi
 In these also the first element which he named "prakriti" or "pradhan" was proved to be the origin of the remaining twenty three
 chit purush ke saannnidhya se isi ek tatv "prakruti" ko kramash: taees avaantar tatwon main parinat hokar samast jad jagat ko utpann karti hui mana tha
 Thus behind the determination of element number, there seems to be a huge intellectual practice of statistics
 aakhir sookshm buddhi ke dwaara deergh kaal tak bina chintan or vishleshan kiye tatwon kii sankhya kaa nirdhaaran kaise sambhav hua hoga? From the above discussion, it is decided that the "sankhya" name of Sankhya philosophy is indicative of its rational argument with both types
 sankhyon kaa achit prakruti tathaa chit purush, donon hi moolbhoot tatwon ko aagam yaa shruti pramaan se siddh maanate hue bhi mukhyat: anumaan pramaan ke aadhaar par siddh karnaa bhi isi baat kaa parichaayak he
 It is clear from the view of both the Samkhya discourse formulas and the numeric texts available these days that it is proved by the inference based on both the fundamental elements of Samkhya - nature and power of man
 purush kii anekta main bhi yuktiyaan hi di gai hai
 Satirism has also been established on the basis of arguments
 
 Thus the Sravana scripture, which is the foundation of wisdom knowledge, is logic-oriented
 manan, anukaal tarkon dwaara shastrokt tathyon tathaa siddhanton kaa chintan he hi
 Thus, the number or wisdom due to which the Sankhya philosophy got its "sankhya" name has a special relationship with logic and intellectualism
 is buddhivaad ke kaaran avaantar kaal main sankhya darshan ke kuch siddhant vaidic sampradaay se bahut kuch swatantra rup se viksit hue jiske kaaran baadaraayan vyas tathaa shankaracharya aadi aacharyon ne iskaa khandan karte hue avaidic sampradaay, tak kah daalaa
 This sect does not appear to be non-vedic in its origin and in its latter form is also not completely vedic
 prasiddh bhashyakaar vigyanbhikshu ne bhi sankhya ko aagam yaa shruti kaa sat tarkon dwaara kiya jane vaala manan hi mana he
 He has said the same thing in his Sankhya discourse-sutra-annotation of the commentary, which removes the entire campaign of the Vedic word Jiva, which is "ekvodi:", etc
, to free the man from all kinds of cosmic forms
 Non-narrator says that the narrator Narayanavatar Bhagwan Kapil was born to preach the Sad tips required for contemplating the meaning of those Vedas
 vigyaan bhikshu ke purv pravachanon se spasht he ki ve sankhya shaastra ko vedanusaari maanate hai
 He is clear that he supports the meaning of the Vedic verses "ekvidiyyah", etc
 through Sad tips and arguments, rendering and deliberating it makes it understandable
 vigyanbhikshu ne vastut: lok main prachlit purv parampara kaa hi anusaran karte hue apana purvokt mat prakat kiya he
 Since the very ancient times, in the Mahabharata, Gita, Ramayana, Smriti and Puranas, not only is there a mention of the Sankhya as a high knowledge, but there is also a detailed description of its principles
 gita main bhi sankhya darshan ke trigunatmak siddhant ko badi sundar reeti se apanaaya gaya he
 "trigunatmika Prakriti is the continual resultant
 uske teenon gun hi sadaa kuch na kuch parinaam utpann karte rahete hai, purush akarta he" -sankhya kaa yah siddhant gita ke nishkaam karmyog kaa aavashyak ang ban gaya he 
 Similarly elsewhere, many theories of Samkhya philosophy are visible in the ancient Sanskrit Vadmay, complementing the principles of other philosophies
 in sab baton se aisa prathit hota he ki yah darshan apane mul main vaidic hi rahaa he, avaidic nahin, kyonki yadi satya isse vipareet hota to vedapraan is desh main sankhya ke itane adhik prachaar-prasar ke liye uparyukt kshetra na miltaa
 Vedanta commentator Shankaracharya, who refuted it as Vedah due to the so-called Vedas against the principles of Atheism, Prakriti dualism, consequentialism, etc
, also had to write in the commentary of Brahmasutra 2
1
3 that "even after having many spiritual memories, the Sankhya Yoga memories only Attempt was made in disposal
 kyonki ye donon lok main param purusharth ke saadhan rup main prasiddh hai, shisht mahapurushon dwaara gruhit hai tathaa "tatkaarann sankhya yogabhishanna gyatva devam muchyate sarvapashai: yaa ityadi shrot lingon se yukt hai
 "it is also clear from the evidence of the commentator himself that even during the time of his predecessor Sutrakara, many elegant men considered Sankhya philosophy as Vedic philosophy and followed it as a means of ultimate effort
 in sab tathyon ke aadhaar par sankhya darshan ko mulat: vaidic hi maananaa samichin he
 Yes, in its later development it must have gone against the Vedas in some fundamental principles like the latter is nirvishvara against the Sankhya Vedic tradition, its nature independently creates the entire world
 parantu is darshan kaa mul pracheenatam chhandogya evam vrihadaaranyak upanishdon main praapt hota he
 Its antiquity is evident from this
 is darshan ke do hi moulik granth aaj uplabdh hai- pehla chah adhyyon vaala "sankhya-pravachan-sutara" or doosraa sattar karikaon vaala "sankhyakarika"
 Apart from these two, there is also a very small sutra script which is famous as "tattva Samas"
 shesh samast sankhya vadmay inhen teenon kii tikaa or upatika maatr he
 Among them, Kapil is considered to be from the Upadesha tradition of Sankhya Sutras
 kai kaarnon se uplabdh sankhya-pravachan-sutron ko vidwaan log kapilkrit nahin maanate
 It is definitely certain that even considering these sources as Kapilopotip, many of its sites will have to be projected on the strength of the inter-target of the sources themselves
 sankhyakarikas, ishwarkrishna dwaara rachit hai, jinka samay bahumat se i
 tritiy shatabdi kaa madhya mana jaataa he
 In fact, their time seems to be long before this
 kapil ke shishy asuri kaa koi granth nahin bataaya jaataa, parantu inke prathit shishy acharya panchasikh ke naam se anek sutron ke vyasakrut yogabhashya aadi pracheen granthon main uddhrut hone se spasht prathit hota he ki inke dwaara rachit koi sutaragranth ati pracheen kaal main prasiddh tha
 By the opinion of many scholars, this famous book was Shashistantra
 udaiveer shastri ke mat se vartmaan kaal main uplabdh shadadhyaai sankhya-pravachan-sutara hi shashthi padaarthon kaa nirupan karne ke kaaran "shashthitantr" ke naam se bhi gyaat tha
 By his opinion, probably Panch Shikhacharya of Kapil Muni had written an explanation on it and that too was called Shashtantra in the name of the original text
 kuch vidwaanon ke mat se "shashthi tantra" prasiddh sankhyacharya varshganya kaa likhaa hua he
 Today there is no special knowledge about many other ancient figures like Jagishdhya, Deval, Asit etc
 surya ke varnmandal ke pare ke bhaag ko kirit yaa corona kehete hai
 At the time of full solar eclipse, it is of white color and looks beautiful like white dalia flower
 kirit atyant vistrut pradesh he or prakaash-mandal ke upar uski oonchaai surya ke vyas kii kai guni hoti he
 Corona is a pastel halo formed around the sun by diffraction of the moon or water droplets
 iskaa nirmaan plasma dwaara hota he
 Drops in the clouds such as Cirostratus and the cloud layer themselves must be almost completely identical in order for this event to occur
 The color display sometimes seems to be enjoyable
 corona kaa taapmaana lakhon degree he
 The corona is visible only from the earth during a total solar eclipse
 corona surya kii sabase badi part hoti he
 The acute temperature of the corona is not yet known
 saura vaayu surya se lagbhag 400 se 700 kimi prati second kii gati se baahar nikalati he
 With the help of a telescope its actual expansion cannot be known, as the intensity of light decreases rapidly as we move away from the sun
 at: photograph patt par ek nishchit oonchaai ke pashchaat kirit ke prakaash kaa chithran nahin ho saktaa
 The radio telescope has proven to be more accurate in determining the extent of the kit
 iske dwaara nirikshan ke anusaar kirit prakashmandal ke upar surya ke das vyaason ke baraabar oonchaai se bhi adhik vistrut ho saktaa he
 Reflected wave should be studied by sending radio wave to the outer part of the kit
 at: radiyon doordarshee kii bhi upyogita simit he
 Ryle has derived a bizarre method for Kirit's study
 prati varsh june maas main toras taramandal kaa ek tara kirit ke sameep aata he
 As the Sun moves due to the annual motion of the Earth, it moves in front of this star, continuous measurement of the intensity of the radio wave coming from the star is made
 yah tivrata kirit kii drishy seemaa tak taare ke pahunchne se pehle hi kam hone lagati he
 It has been observed that in fact, the intensity of radio waves starts attenuating from 20 times the radius of the Sun
 yaheen nahin, kabhi-kabhi kirit padaarth lakhon kilometre dur tak aa jaataa hai or kabhi-kabhi to vah prithvi tak pahunchakar bheeshan chumbakeey vikshobh or deeptiman dhruvaprabha utpann kar detaa he
 The range of Kirit is not fixed but varies with the Sun Moon
 adhiktam kalank par vah lagbhag vrittiya hoti hai isamen se chaaron ore aniyamit rup se failaa hota he iske viruddh nunatam kalank par vah surya ke vishuvadvritiya samtal main adhik vistrut ho jaati he
 This leads to the conclusion that the shape of the Kirit is dependent on the magnetic field of the Sun

 panihaari rajasthan kaa pariddh lok nrity he
 Part of a category on Sikhism khalsa sikh dharm ke vidhiwat dikshaprapt anuyaayiyon samuhik rup he
 The Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh ji in Anandpur Sahib on the day of Baisakhi on 1699
 is din unhone sarvapratham paanch pyaaron ko amritpan karvaa kar khalsa banaaya tathaa tatpashchaat un paanch pyaaron ke haathon se swayan bhi amritpan kiya
 Satguru Gobind Singh has honored Khalsa with the status of "kaal Purakh ki Army" in Khalsa glory
 talwaar or kesh to pehle hi sikhon ke paas the, guru gobind singh ne "khande bate kii pahul" tayar kar kacha, kadaa or kangha bhi diya
 On the same day, "singh" was put behind the name of Khalse
 shaareerik dekh main khalse kii bhinta najar aane lagi
 But the Khalsa did not give up self-knowledge, his propaganda continued and the sword also continued when needed
 sikh dharm ke upar anya dharmon or sarkari numaayindo ke waar lagaataar bad gaye the
 By giving false news to the government, staunch followers of Islam got Guru Arjun Dev ji sentenced to death
 jab guru arjuna dev, ko bahut dukh de kar shahid kar diya gaya to guru hargobind ji ne talwaar uthaa lee
 This sword was raised only for self-defense and for the betterment of the general public
 guru hargobind ji ke jivan main un par lagaataar 4 hamale hue or satguru hari raae par bhi ek hamalaa hua
 Guru Hari Krishna also tried to make emperor Aurangzeb his follower
 guru teg bahadur ko sarkaar ne maut ke ghat utaar diya, kyonki wo hindu brahminon ke dukhon ko dekh kar sarkaar se apil karne gaye the
 After that, the government clergy started considering the increasing propaganda of Gurmat and the huge number of followers as a threat to their religion and they united against it
 is bich guru gobind singh ne kuch baniyon kii rachana kii jis main islam ke khilaaf sakht tippaniyan thi
 In view of the above circumstances and the oppressive behavior of Aurangzeb and his nominees towards the non-muslim people, when Guru Gobind Singh decided to wage an armed struggle to protect the religion, he looked for the Sikhs who pursue the Gurmat ideology, help the miseries
 Do and do not back down in the sacrifice of your sacrifice when you need it
 jab koi dharm aage badhata he to uske bahut aam dikhta he ki uske anuyaayi bahut hai, zyaadaatar to dekha-dekhi ho jate hai, kuch shardha main ho jate hai, kuch apane khudgarji ke kaaran ho jate hai, asal anuyaayi to hote hi gine chune hai
 Evidence of this was found in Anandpur
 jab satgur gobind singh ne talwaar nikal kar kaha kii ""unhen ek sir chaiye"" | sab hakke bakke rah gaye | kuch to maukey se hi khisak gaye | kuch kehane lag pade guru pagal ho gaya he | kuch tamaasha dekhne aae the | kuch mata gujri ke paas bhaag gaye kii dekho tumharaa saputra kya khichdi pakaa rahaa he | Bhai Daya Singh ji was the first hand in the crowd of 10 thousand
 Behind the Gurmat ideology, he had the ability to behead
 Guru Sahib took him to the tent
 There was a goat neck cut
 Blood appeared to come out of the tent
 Fear increased in public
 Even then, by showing snow, Dharam Singh, Himmat Singh, Mohkam Singh, Sahib Singh accepted to cut their sis
 Guru Sahib kept goatting
 paanchon ko phir tamboo se bahar niklaa or khande bate kii pahul tayar kii | Khanda Bata is composed of Jantra mantras and tantras smelled
 isko pehali baar satgur gobind singh ne banaaya tha
 The water prepared by this method is called "pahul"
 aam bhashaa main ise log amrit bhi kehete hai
 By drinking this, the Sikh becomes a part of the Khalsa Army, that is, he has now surrendered his body and wealth to God, now he will only proclaim the truth and if the need arises, he will not back down from cutting his throat
 sab vikaron se dur rahegaa
 Such a Sikh is also called Amritdhari
 yah pahul paanchon ko pilaai gai or unhen paanch pyaaron ke kitaab se niwaja
 2 Kakkar was already in Sikhism
 jahaan sikh atmik satl par sab se bheen samaj rakhata tha satgur gobind singh ji ne un do kakaron ke saath saath kangha, kadaa or kacha de kar shaareerik dekh main bhi khalse ko bhinn kar diya
 Today, Khande Bate's Pahul prepares only five beloved
 yah prikriya aaj rivaaj ban gayi he
 Today the test is not taken as it was
 is prikriya ko amrit sanchaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 History is a witness to the fact that Guru Gobind Singh ji also used to run under five love and obeyed his orders
 paanch pyaaron ne gobind singh ko chamkor kaa kila chhodane kaa hukum diya or unhen maananaa padaa
 The five loves then interrupted Gobind Singh ji, while Gobind Singh was greeting Dadu's tomb to examine these
 gobind singh ne banda bahadur ko bhi paanch pyaaron ke sang bheja gaya, itihaas main zikr he ki jab banda bahadur pyaaron kii ulanghnaa karata rahaa to banda bahadur ko sab kile main chhod gaye
 Gobind Singh and the Khalsa army helped Bahadur Shah and also took iron from his brother to make him the ruler
