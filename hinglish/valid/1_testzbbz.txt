 MOSFET is an electronic device used to amplify or switch electrical signals
 vaise to yah chaar taangon vaali yukti he, get, dren or body ) kintu praayah b terminal ko strot terminal ke saath jodakar hi iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 So, practically like other field-effect transistors, it also becomes a three-terminal device
 kisi samay bijetti sarvaadhik prayukt yukti thi, kintu ab mossphate hi digital or analog donon paripathon main sarvaadhik prayukt yukti ban gayi he
 The reason for this is that very high 'packing density' is being achieved cheaply in integrated circuits using mosphates
 yadhyapi aajkal get ko vilag karne ke liye 'metal oxide' ke bajaay dop kiya hua policilicon upyog kiya jaataa he phir bhi iskaa purana naam MOSFET ab bhi aparivartit he
 The drain-source current of the mosphates is controlled by the potential difference between the gate and the source
 chunki get, mosphate ke shesh bhaagon se vilgit hota he, get ko chalaane ke liye atyant kam dhara kii jarurat hoti he

 meghrahit akaash main raatri ke samay prakaash ke binduon kii tarah bikhare hue, timatimaate prakashwale bahut se taare dikhalaai dete hai
 Some groups of glowing stars divide the sky into different parts
 in taron ke samooh ko taramandal kehete hai
 The entire sky has been divided into 89 constellations and the names of those constellations have been named
 raashichakr ke taramandal bahut prasiddh hai, inaki sangya mesh, vrish aadi he
 The strings of a single constellation are selected in descending order of their visual radiance
 phir taramandal ke naam ke aage greek bhashaa ke akshar rakhkar taron kaa namakaran kiya jaataa he, jaise mesh raashi ke sabase chamkile taare kaa namakaran alfatareez kiya gaya he
 In some constellations the number of strings is so high that the number of letters of the Greek alphabet falls short for them
 aise taron ke namakaran ke liye taramandal ke purv latin akshar tathaa aavashyaktaa padane par sankhyaayein likh dete hai
 Some stars are famous for being over-illuminated and their names can be known without reference to the constellations, such as Lubbhak, Magha, Chitra etc
 is prakaar ke namakaran se taron ko pahchaanane main sahaayta milti he
 Some stars appear more bright and some less bright when viewed with empty eyes
 inaki kanti ke unadhiky ke anusaar ham taron ko kai kantimanon main vargit kar lete hai
 The stars are located far away from us
 duuri ke badhane se kam chamkile taare ham dikhaai nahin dete
 Without the aid of a machine, our eyes can see the stars up to the sixth milestone
 kantimanon kaa vargeekaran is prakaar he kijo taare sabase adhik chamkile dikhalaai padate hai, unka kantimaan nunatam sankhya mana jaataa he, usase kam chamkile taron kaa usase adhik ityadi
 It is 2
512 times brighter or 2
512 times the radiance of the preceding radiant star
 is prakaar pratham kantimaan kaa tara dwitiya kantimaan ke taare se 2
512 guna chamkila tathaa dwitiya kantimaan kaa tara tritiy kantimaan ke taare se 2
512 guna chamkila hota he
 If we assume the brightness of the sixth fifth star, then the brightness of the stars from the first to the sixth will be in the ratio 100: 39
82: 15
85: 6: 31: 2:51: 1
 is drishy kantimaan ke maapan main surya kii kantimaan - 26

5 he
 From the 200-inch diameter reflecting telescope of Mount Palomar Observatory, we can see up to 23 radiant stars
 kantimaan maapan kaa arth he taare ke prakaash kii tivrata kaa maapan
 Earlier this work was done by the eyes with the help of special types of photometers
 is prakaar gyaat kiye gaye kantimaan ko drishy kantimaan kehete hai
 Eyes are sensitive to yellow light, so visible yellow and green are the measure of light
 baad main kantimaapan photography kii platon kii sahaayta se kiya jane laga
 Kantikan known in this way is called Photographic Thread
 photography kantimaan nile rang ke prakaash ke maapak hai
 The stars radiate light of many colors
 at: taron ke kantimaan gyaat karne ke liye vibhinn rangon kii sugrahi platon ke dwaara tathaa varnashodhakon ke upyog se unke prakaash kii tivrata aanki jaati he
 The difference between photographic and visual parameters on yellow sensitive plates with yellow color filters is called character indicator
 isse taron kaa taap gyaat hota he
 The intensity of light is measured by accepting and multiplying the light on current photographic cells
 kantimaan ko maapte samay hamen vayumandal ke prabhaav tathaa taron kii antarvarti dhul tathaa gaison ke prabhaav ko bhi drushti main rakhana padataa he
 Accurate knowledge of radiance helps us to know the distances of stars and many physical substances
 bahut se taron kaa nijee prakaash bahut adhik he, kintu atyaadhik duuri par sthir hone ke kaaran unka drishy kantimaan adhik dikhalaai padataa he
 The true scale can be known only if they are located at equal distance from the subsurface
 samast taron ko 10 parsek kii duuri par kalpit karke gyaat kiye gaye kantimaan ko nirpeksh kantimaan kehete hai
 If we know the visible radius of the star and its distance, then we can know the absolute radius from the following formula: nirpekshkantimaan drishyakantimaan 5 - 5 laghuganak duuri, parsekon main he
 Opposite: If we know the absolute record, then we can also know the distances of stars
 surya kaa nirpeksh kantimaan 4
7 he
 The radius of a star relative to the sun is called relative radiance
 isamen surya kii kanti 1 maan lee jaati he
 With this type of study, we study the energy obtained by stars, which helps in studying their physical conditions
 na8na In the perfectly clear sky, we do not see more than 3,200 stars of vision aids
 chunki ham akaash ke keval aadhe hisse ko hi dekh pate hai at: chakshudrishy taron kii sankhya 6,500 ke lagbhag he
 In these 1,5 kantimaan se adhik chamkile 20 taare 50 stars up to 2 radiant 3 kantimaan tak chamkile 150 taare hai 4 stars up to 500 radiant tara 5 kantimaan tak chamkile 1500 taare hai The rest of the image is of the sixth record
 yadi ham apni drushti ko 10 guni antarmukhi kar len to drishy taron kii sankhya 1000 guna bad jaaegi, arthath yadi taron ko samroop se failaa hua maan liya jaae to unki sankhya unki duuri kii chah guni bad jaaegi
 This relationship is limited to more bright stars
 kam gallexi main vishaltam doordarshee dwaara gyaat taron kii sankhya lagbhag 1, xxwrep 2 00, 000 he
 To find the true speed and movement of a star, we divide its speed into two parts
 drushtisutra par lamb disha kii gati ke koniya maan ko taare kii nijee gati kehete hai
 Personal speeds of stars are less
 unhen gyaat karne ke liye hamen bahut doorvarti kaalon main liye gaye taron ke photographon kii tulana kerani padati he
 The stars that are closest to us move back and forth relative to distant stars
 is koniya maan ko kaal ke antaraal se bhaag dene par nijee gati gyaat ho jaati hai
 The asterisks of the direction of this angular sight is called the radial velocity
 traigy veg jaanane ke liye ham varnakramdarshi kii sahaayta se taare kaa varnakram le lete hai
 If the spectral lines move towards the blue end, then we know with the help of the Doppler principle that the star is coming towards us and, if the spectral lines are towards the red end, it is moving away from us
 rekhaon kaa sthanantaran unke tragyveg kaa anukramanupati hota he
 Benard has known the personal speed of the star of a dashing radius of the Ophiucus planetarium at 10
3 per year, which is the largest
 nijee gati kaa gyaan tarapunjon ke adhyayan main sahaayak hota he tathaa isse ham yah bhi jaan jate hai ki adhik neeli gati ke taare apekshaakrit hamaare nikat hai
 To understand the radius of the velocity relative to the Sun, we also have to take into account the speed of the Earth
 nijee gati tathaa traigy veg ke gyaan se bal-samaantar-chaturbhuj ke siddhant dwaara vaastavik gati tathaa uski disha gyaat ho jaati he
 Trigonometric methods are used to find distances of stars
 hamase ati sameep tara bhi itani duuri par he ki yadi ham prithvi ke vyas ko aadhaar maanakar uski dishaao ko dekhen to ve samaantar prathit hotin hai, arthath taare kaa lamban shunya hi aata he
 Therefore, to find the parallax of stars, we need a larger base
 at: prithvi kii kaksha ke vyas ko ham aadhaar banaate hai
 If we observe a star's direction six months after its perforation, we get the basis of the diameter of the earth's orbit
 is prakaar ke vedh se samipsth taare duurastha taron ke saapeksh thodaa dik parivartan dikhalaate hai
 While extracting this, we also have to consider the effect of the personal motion of the star
 to bhi yah itnaa kam he ki nikatatam taare kaa lamban 76 he
 If a star has a parallax of 1, it is 2,06,265 times the radius of the Earth's orbit from Earth
 is duuri ko ek parsek kehete he
 Another unit used to measure distance is the light year
 prakaash kaa veg 1,86,000 mile prati second he
 The distance that light travels in a year with this velocity is called a light year, this distance is about 60, xxwrep 2 00, 000 miles
 ek parsek lagbhag 3
26 prakaash varsh ke tulya hota he
 By trigonometric method we can only find the distances of the most proximal wires
 at: doorvarti taron kii dooriyaan gyaat karne ke liye hamen anya vidhiyon kaa aashray lenaa padataa he
 If we can somehow know the absolute record of stars, then we can find their distances with the help of the formula given in the title Absolute Record
 saubhaahgya se hamen sefiid tathaa lira varg ke taare uplabdh hai, jinke nirpeksh kantimaan ham gyaat kar sakate hai
 The following are other methods of finding the perpendiculars of stars: in vargikarnon kaa nijee mahatv he or inase hamen taron ke vishleshan main vishesh sahaayta milti he
 The following is a brief introduction to these classifications: surya hamaara nikatatam tara he, jiskaa ham bahut acchhee tarah adhyayan kar sakate hai
 Most stars are available to us by studying the elements of stars, which were born around the same time as our Sun
 ye taare taap, aakaar tathaa kanti ke avaroh anukram main hai
 This class is called the main sequence
 isamen atyaadhik taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar se lagbhag 10 guna tathaa nimna taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar se lagbhag 10 guna tathaa nimna taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar kaa lagbhag dashamansh hoga
 The Sun is a medium-sized star of this sequence, whose mass and temperature are below average
 mukhya anukram ke vakr main upar kii ore taare atyant viral hai
 Most of the stars in this sequence are smaller than the Sun and warmer
 inamen uplabdh tatwon kii maatra surya jaisi he
 From the study of the Sun, we have two more main classes of stars in addition to this class: there are three main differences of the Danvar stars
 daanavaakar, tathaa vamanakaar taare
 The three main differences of donor stars - demonetisation, extreme donor and donor
 atidanavaakar taare aakaar main bahut vishaal hote hai
 For example, the diameter of Jyestha is about 300 times the diameter of the Sun
 daanavaakar taron main khagaashv ke dwitiya beta pigasi kaa vyas surya ke vyas se 170 guna tathaa brahmahruday kaa, surya ke vyas se, 12 guna he
 The sublingual stars lie between the main sequence and the star of the demon class
 vamanakaar taron ke bhi vaaman, upwaman, lalarang vaaman tathaa shwet-vaaman bhed hai
 White left-wing stars have special significance in these sections
 inaki visheshta yah he ki inaki dravyamatra madhya shrenee kii tathaa kanti kam hoti he, kintu inkaa aakaar bahut chota tathaa inkaa ghanatv atyant adhik hota he
 Of the many stars we see, there are a large number of stars, which are members of our Galaxy
 hamaari gallexi apane main ek vishwa he
 Its shape is spiral
 bahut se anya taravishwa bhi hai, jinka aakaar sarpil he
 To study their composition and shape, we get help from the study of some special types of stars of our Akashganga
 in taron ke gukhyat: do varg hai
 Some stars are always available in the spiral arms of the Galaxy and others are found near the nucleus of the Galaxy
 inamen pratham varg ke taare hamaare surya ke nikat padosi hai tathaa duusare varg ke taare surya se dur hai
 Walter Wade named the stars of the first class as the first star series, or population first, and the stars of the second class named the second star series, or population second
 in donon prakaar ke taravargo ke varnakram-kanti-vakron main bhinnata hoti he
 The very bright stars of the first star are blue and have an absolute radius of 7 or 8, while the bright stars of the second star are red and have an absolute radius of 3 or more
 pratham tarashrenee ke taron main taron kii antarvarti gas tathaa dhul atyadhik maatra main he, jabaki dwitiya tarashrenee ke taron main yah atyant kam maatra main he
 The study of these stars gives us not only to determine the spiral arms and nuclei of galaxies, but they also help us to study the origin and evolution of stars
 taron kii dravyamatra ke anu, jo mulavastha main udasin rahete hai, taap main uttarotar vruddhi hone ke kaaran ynikrut hokar apane rin vidyutkanon ko adhikadhik maatra main khone lagate hai
 Due to this effect, there are variations in the bright and black lines formed in the spectrum of such stars
 duusare shabdon main rekhaayen taron ke prakaash vikeern karanevaale anuon ke taap kii vibhinn avasthaaon kii dyotak hai
 Thus, their main 10 distinctions have been made by the study of the spectrum of stars, which are expressed by the capital letters O, B, A, F, G, K, M, R, N, and s of the Roman script
 chunki varnakram vargeekaran kaa taap se sambandh he, at: ek hi varg ke taara ke taap main uttarottar hraas bataane ki liye o varnakram ke taron ke liye o ke baad angraji varnmaala ke chote e se i tak ke varna rakh die jate hai tathaa o, oba aadi
 To express a similar intent, the digits from b to m are numbered from 0 to 9, followed by their indicator letters
 ye ynikrut helium vaale taare hai
 The lines of ionized helium and double triple ionized oxygen and nitrogen are found in their spectrum
 is ynikrut avasthaa ke anusaar iskaa prishthiya taap 30, xxrep 4 0 se lekar 40, xxrep 4 0 sein0 tak athwa isse bhi adhik hona chahie
 o The number of known stars of the spectrum is not more than hundred, in which most cannot be seen with naked eyes
 is varg ke teen taare, gamma belorum oe,, jita papsis oe tathaa jitaorin, oi5 chakshu drukshya hai
 These are neutral helium stars
 inkaa prishthiya taap 25,000° se 12,000° sein0 tak rahata he
 Although this heat is unable to ionize helium, ionized oxygen lines are available in its spectrum
 bi5 taare se lekar nimnatar taap ke taron main helium tathaa ynikrut oxigen rekhaayen kam hone lagati hai or varnakram ke begni bhaag kii or hidrogen rekhaayen tathaa hidrogen kii chaudee kaali avasorana rekhaayen ubhar aati he
 There are many stars in our stars
 ye hydrogen pramukh taare hai
 Their surface temperature ranges from 12,000 ° c to 8,000 ° C
 inaki sankhya atyaadhik he
 Some astrologers called them calcium stars
 inkaa prishthiya taap 8,000° se lekar 6,000° se0 tak hota he
 These are the stars of the Sun's range
 inke varnakram main ynikrut calcium kii rekhaayen khub ubhari rahati hai
 Their surface temperature ranges from 6,000 ° to 4,000 ° C
 12,000° ji varnakrameey taare pahachaane ja chuke hai
 Their surface heat ranges from 5,000 ° to 3,5000 ° C
 pehle ye suryakalank taron ke naam se prasiddh the
 Tetonium oride stars

 Almost all of them are movable stars, in which there is no eye sight alone
 inkaa prishthiya taap 3,000° se lekar 5,000° ain0 tak he
 These are all donors and mostly movable stars
 ye bahut kam sankhya main hai
 None of these taras are simply visuals from Chakshu
 kuch taare aise hai, jinaki kanti badhati ghatati rahati he
 These are called stars
 chal taron kaa spasht nirdesh karne liye taramandal ke aage angreji varnmaala ke bade akshar aar, es, tii aadi rakh die jate hai, yatha aar seti aadi
 As their number increases, two or three letters may also have to be placed in place of one letter, such as RR Lira etc
 lagbhag 20,000 chal taare gyaat hai tathaa unka niyamit rup se vegh kiya jaataa he
 There are two huge classes of wires: first running outward and second running automatically
 bahyahetuk chal taare grahauakari yugma taare hote hai
 Among them Alugula Tara is famous
 iskaa saamaanya kantimaan 2
2 hai, kintu yah 3
4 tak ho jaataa he
 Automatic moving stars can be placed in three categories: vibratory moving, explosive moving and other moving stars
 inamen kuch taron kaa aavartan kaal ek din se bhi kam hota he
 Such stars belong to the RR Lira class
 kuch kaa aavartan kaal 1 se lekar 50 din tak kaa he
 Such stars are stars of the Cepheid class
 kuch taron kaa aavartankaal 100 se lekar 1000 din tak kaa he
 These are called long-term stars
 is varg ke taare laal rang ke daanavaakar taare hote hai
 Some stars are semi-regular, their cycle ranges from 40 to 150 days
 ye taare bhi laal rang ke daanavaakar taare hote hai
 Among these, RR Lyra and Cepheid stars are very important
 aar lira taron kaa yah naam isliye padaa ki ye sab gunon main lira taramandal main varnit us chal taare ke samaan hai, jiskaa naam aar aar lira rakhaa gaya
 It should not be understood from the name that such stars occur only in Lyra constellations, but stars in this category are everywhere in our galaxy and other constellations etc
 in taron kii mahatta kii kaaran he inkaa durisuchak hona
 Even when the period of rotation of the stars of RR Lira class does not differ in their absolute value
 iskaa arth yah he ki kisi ek taraguchh tarapranali main aar aar lira taare hon, to ve samaan nirpeksh kantimaan ke honge or yah samaan nirpeksh kantimaan lagbhag shunya ke tulya he
 In such a state, their distance from knowledge of their visual radiance can be known by the following formula
 nirpeksh kantimaan = drishy kantimaan + 5 - 5 laghuganak duuri He got this name because his nature is similar to Delta Cepheus, or Charuth Kapish
 chaturth kapish sefiod varg kaa sarvaadhik chamkila tara he, jise chakshu se dekha ja saktaa he
 The periodicity of cephaid wires ranges from a few days to more than 45 days
 hamaari gallexi ke sefiid taron main 7 din kaa aavartankaal praaia: hota he
 The biggest feature of cepheid stars is to be consistent with the periodic-radius-associative rule
 iskaa arth he ki sefiid taron ke aavartan kaal main jaise jaise vruddhi hoti he vaise vaise unke nirpeksh kantimaan main vruddhi hoti jaati he
 This relationship is very important
 isaki sahaayta se sefiid taron kaa nirpeksh kantimaan jaanakar purv sutara dwaara inaki duuri gyaat kii ja sakati he
 With the help of cepheid stars, the distances of galaxies and starfish are determined
 taapajanit rang ke parivartan kaa kaaran saamanyat: spandan siddhant kalpit kiya gaya he, jiskaa aashay he ki sefiid taron ke tal main aavartan se vruddhi tathaa hraas hota he, jisase tara krmanusaar failata tathaa sikudta rahata he
 In fact, the flutter theory does not provide an accurate answer to all situations
 at: aajkal jyotishi samajhane lage hai ki sefiid taron kii vibhinn sthitiyaan inke taap ke parivartan ke kaaran hai, jiskaa sway ek punrariti chakra he
 More than 1,000 cephoid stars are known
 aise taron main niyamit athwa aniyamit rup se visphot hota he
 These stars are usually extremely foggy, but their radiance increases very exceptionally after an explosion
 yah sthiti kuch din rahane ke baad taare apni kii si saamaanya kanti main aa jate hai
 These types of stars are called Navtara
 1918 i0 ke ekvilla tarapunj ke navtare kii chamak chaar hi din ke bheetar pehle se chalis hajaar guna bad gai thi
 Other famous navataras are: Navtara of the Percuss planetarium, 1925 Victorian Navtara and Navtara of the Hercules planetarium of 1934
 jo navtare visphot ke baad atyant asaadhaaran rup se chamkile ho jate he, unhe atinavtara kehete hai
 In 1885, the supernatural of the Andromeda nebula radiated so much light in six days that the sun would be able to radiate as much light in 10 million years
 anya prakaar ke chal taare praaia: aniyamit aavartankaal ke hai
 On a clean night, some blurred light spots appear in the sky
 yadi ham inhen shaktishaalee yantron se dekhen to inamen teen prakaar kii vastuen milti hai: taare ke guchchhe, niharikas tathaa gallexiyaan
 The nebulae are made up of luminous gases and glaciers are independent galaxies like our Galaxy
 taron ke guchchhe do prakaar ke hai, ek to ve jo akashgangeey samtal main, yaa akashgangeey sarpil bhujaaon ke paas uplabdh hote hai
 Such flakes are called celestial flakes
 inamen taron kii sankhya apekshkrit kam rahati hai
 In this type of class, the diamond cluster is very bright and large
 golakaar taraguchh sarpil bhujaaon se dur tathaa nabhik ke paas hote hai
 Spherical galaxies have relatively more stars
 ye praaia: ghundle se dikhaai dete hai
 They are seen only through visionaries
 omenga centari tathaa 47 tukane panchal kantimaan ke, chakshudrishy, golakaar taraguchh kaa population dwitiya se sambandh he
 Of course, they have knowledge of the stages of development of stars
 in taron main vidyaman aar aar lira tathaa sefiid taron kii sahaayta se gucchh kii duuri gyaat kii jaati he
 Their study helps a lot in studying the appearance of the Galaxy
 adhikash taare dohare, athwa bahusankhyak, hote hai, inamen kuch taron kii jodiyon main paraspar kuch bhi sambandh nahin hota, kintu ve ati sameep isliye dikhaai dete hai ki ve hamaari drushtirekha kii ore sthit hai
 Such stars are called double stars
 aise taare kam hai
 Most stars are actually with one or more stars
 do taare, jo paraspar aakarshan se ek nishichat prakaar ke dirdhavritakar maarg main bhraman karte hai, tara-yugma kehalaate hai
 Having determined that a star is actually a pair, we can know many things about its relationship, because its, or its companion star's, motion follows a broader gravitational law
 yugma taron kii gati tathaa dravyamatra ko nishchit rup se gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 There are mainly three types of pairing: visual, receptive and spectral
 drishy yugmataron kii kaksha kaa gyaan karne ke liye unki duuri tathaa sthiti kone kaa vegh karnaa padataa he
 Most visual pairings have a long rotation period, which requires hundreds of years of weights to detect
 isiilie yadhyapi 25,000 se bhi adhik drishy yugmatare gyaat ho chuke hai, tathaapi 200 se adhik kii kaksha kaa gyaan abhi tak nahin ho sakaa he
 The orbit of the eclipse of the receptive pair often tends to tilt a little in the direction of our line of sight, so that one star covers the other completely or partially, and the light of one star is not visible to us
 isse yugmatare kii pahchaan ho jaati hai, kyonki saamaanya sthiti main is taare kaa jitna prakaash rahata he grahan ke samay pehle kii apeksha kam ho jaataa he
 These eclipses occur from the appointed time

2 ho jaataa he
 The level of the orbit of some of the couriers does not go near the Earth, so we cannot see the position of its eclipse
 kintu uske varnakram kii rekhaon ke parivartan se hamen pataa chal jaataa he ki yah tara kabhi hamaari ore aata tathaa kabhi hamase dur jaataa he, jisase spasht he ki yah kisi adrishy taare ke chaaron ore dhooma rahaa he
 Such stars have a shorter rotation period for spectral pairs
 lagbhag 309 varnakrameey taron kii kakshaayen gyaat ho chuki hai
 The sizes of stars are often known by three methods: nirpeksh kantimaan tathaa taap se, From the eclipse of the receptive couriers and vyatikaranmaapi se
 The first method is based on Planck's following formula: drishy nirpeksh kantimaan Mvis = - 5 log - 0
08 Where r = radius of the star
 grahauakari taare ke grahan ke kaal ke vegh se uski kaksha ke saapeksh uski trigya gyaat ho jaati he
 The angular diameter of the star is known by the telemetrometer and by knowing its distance, its simple linear diameter is also known
 taron ke vyas ke aadhaar par hi unke daanavaakar tathaa vamanakaar aadi naam pade hai
 Direct methods for determining the mass of stars are obtained by studying the speed of association of pair wires
 vyapak gurutvkarshan niyam kii sahaayta se in taron kii dravyamatra gyaat kii jaati he
 The drafts of any Vamana star have not been available less than the tithe of the Sun's Drayaamatra, and stars of more than 10 times Drayaamatra from the Sun are also rare
 kisi taare kaa ghanatv = dravyamatra / aaytan
 Thus, it is seen that the density of the Danvar wires is very low and the left side wires are very low
 jyeshta jaise vishaal taare kaa vyas surya ke vyas kaa 480 guna he, to bhi isaki dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra ke 20 gune se adhik nahin
 As a result, its density is less than 
 xxrep 7 0 2 of the Sun's density
 yah saadhaaran hawa ke ghanatv se bhi bahut kam he
 The density of the Svetavaman star Cerium B, whose radius is 
034 of the radius of the Sun and 86 of the mass of the Sun, is so high that one cubic inch of its mass would weigh one ton
 saamanyata photometer kii sahaayta se, taron ke prakaash ke vibhinn rangon ke ghanatv kii prayogshaala main pehle se gyaat tapon ke rangon ke ghanatv se tulana kar, taron ke prishth kaa taap gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 But the best method to determine this is spectral analysis of their light
 isi ke aadhaar par taron kaa varnakrameey vargeekaran he, jo vastut: unke taap kaa dyotak he
 Stars derive their energy from nuclear reactions
 taron ke nabhik ke taap ke kaaran taron ke hydrogen ke parmaanu nabhikriya se helium ke parmaanuon main parivartit hote rahete hai
 As a result, excessive heat is produced in the stars, which they radiate as light
 bahut adhik urja utpann karne ke liye inhen atyalp vidyutkan khone padate hai
 Therefore, there is no significant decrease in their volume and their life also becomes millions of years
 taron ke vayumandal kaa adhyayan bhi varnakram kii rekhaon se kiya jaataa he
 We have come to know from the study of the atmosphere of the Sun that it contains excessive amounts of hydrogen
 doosraa sthaan helium kaa he
 Other elements are in small quantities, however magnesium and oxygen atoms certainly exist
 gyaat rasinic tatwon main 61 tatv surya ke vayumandal main pahachaane ja chuke hai
 The atmosphere of most stars is like the Sun, however the atmosphere of all stars is not exactly the same
 inamen carbon tathaa oxigen kii matraaon main antar he
 The basic elements of stars are known by the study of their spectral lines
 prayogshla main vibhinn mul tatwon ke varnakram le liye jate hai tathaa taron ke varnakramon kaa unase milan karke taron main upalabadh mul tatwon kii pahchaan kii jaati he
 This type of study has shown that the average stars have about 70 Hydrogen, 28 Helium, 1
5 Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Niran and 0
5 iron group and other heavy elements
 baari tatv population pratham ke taron main lagbhag 3 hote hai tathaa population dwitiya waalon main 1 se bhi kam
 The stars originate from the interstellar gas and dust particles of the stars
 gas ke badalon ke vidyutkan saamanyatya udasin avasthaa main rahete hai, kintu jab koi atyadhik ushn tara inke sameep se jaataa he to ye ynikrut hokar gatisheel ho jate hai tathaa inamen ek nabhik ban jaataa he, jo aasapaas ke gas tathaa dhul ke dravyakanon ko aakrisht karke vishalaroop dhaaran karne lagata he
 When the temperature of the nucleus increases due to speed and shrinkage, the nuclear reaction starts in them, which causes them to radiate light energy and show us the appearance of new stars
 vibhinn prakaar ke taron kii urja vikeernata ke adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki population dwitiya ke taare bahut pracheen hai tathaa papulation pratham ke taare apekshaakrit baad main nirmit hai
 The life of stars refers to their luminous life
 taron ke prakaash kaa aadhaar he, unka hydrogen kaa bhandar, jisaki nabhikeey abhikriya se ve ooshmaa urja praapt karte hai
 The stars which are very bright, naturally consume more of their hydrogen reserves and convert them to helium more quickly
 yadhyapi hydrogen kaa bhandar samaapt hone par bhi taare sankochan dwaara apni ooshmaa urja ko bahut varshon tak praapt kar sakate hai, tathaapi unke jivan kaa mukhya aadhaar unke hydrogen ke upbheg par hi nirbhar rahata he
 The stars that appear bright enough have a lifetime of about 109 years and the main sequence of blurred stars has a life of about 1013 years
 surya kaa jeevankaal lagbhag 1010 varsh hai
 Our desire to unravel the mystery of the starry world around us is very old
 taron ke adhyayan se hamane vishwa ko gallexi jaisi anek tarapranaliyon purna paaya he
 We have learned so much by studying the spectrum of stars by moving the lines towards red color that our world is expanding
 tathaapi apane simit sadhano ke kaaran ham vishwa ke vaastavik rup ko nahin jaan sake hai
