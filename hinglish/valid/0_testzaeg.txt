 Food should be healthy, nutritious and clean
 It should not weaken the power or balance of mind
 This idea does not allow aphrodisiacs or other drugs and intoxicants that can have such effects on the mind
 yah un khaadya yaa vastuon kii bhi anumati nahin detaa he jinhen kisi praani ko markar yaa dard dekar praapt kiya jaataa he
 The reason for this is that the object will have a source of evil

 When two eggs are independently fertilized by two different sperm, two mutual twins are born as a result
 do andey, yaa ova, do yugmanaj banaate hai, isliye unhen dviyugmanaj or biowlyur kehete hai
 Like any of the other siblings, there is little chance of mutual twins having the same chromosome pattern

 The same is true for brothers and sisters from the same parent, meaning that fraternal twins are only brothers and / or sisters who are of the same age
 adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki aapasi judawaan bachche paidaa hone kaa ek anuvanshik aadhaar he
 However, it is only the mother who has an influence on the possibility of having a fraternal twin; There is no known process by which a father can become a factor in the release of more than one egg

 Keating knows that Roark has been the brain behind all of his successful builds, so he goes straight to Roark and asks him for help with the design
 rork ek shart par raji hota he - vah puri tarah gupt rup se cortland kaa dizine kar degaa lekin nirmaan bina pher-badal ke bilkul vaisaa hona chahie jaisaa vah banayega 
 After completing the design, Roark sets out on a ferry trip with Waynand
 jab rork lautataa he ko use gyaat hota he ki, keating ke vaayade ke baavjood, uske dizine main badlaav kiye gaye hai
 He goes and shoots Cortland with gunpowder

 It is usually characterized by specific natural phenomena for long-term reasons, but it is difficult to address some of the recent effects of climate change
 Can only happen
 Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact 
 Concerns are to lead political advocacy proposals to reduce, eliminate, or adapt to this

 Potential climate change may lead to global warming on a large scale and possibly irreversible effects on continental and global scales
 The likelihood, magnitude, and timing is uncertain and controversial, but some possible examples of climate changes include significant slowing of the ocean circulation that transports warm water to the North Atlantic, large reductions in the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, accelerated global warming due to carbon cycle feedbacks in the terrestrial biosphere, and releases of terrestrial carbon from permafrost regions and methane from hydrates in coastal sediments

 == janm ==8-6-1965 === april-june === Jun sau vichaardhaaraen pracheen china main 770 isapurv se 221 isapurv ke basant or sharad kaal or jhagadate rajyon ke kaal main panpane vaale darshanikon or nai vichaardhaaraon ko kehete hai
 This era is considered the golden period of Chinese philosophy
 haalanki is samay main china main bahut rajnatik asthirataa thi or bahut se rajya aapas main koon-karaabe vaale yuddh ladate rahete the, phir bhi china kaa buddhijivi vaataavaran bahut azaad tha or chintan karne waalon ko apane vichaar khulkar prakat karne kaa bahut avasar miltaa tha
 The famous Chinese historiography named the inscription of the great historian is known about this period
 yah is samay main ubhari kuch mukhya vichaardhaaraen hai jinka zikr shiji granth main kiya gaya he
 The Confucian ideology, which is called Rujia in Chinese, has been the most influential way of thinking of this era
 is vichaardhaara kaa vikaas kanceyushious ne jhou rajvansh ke shuru ke kaal ko dekhakar ek adarsh saamaajik or rajnatik vyavastha ke siddhanton ko dhundne ke prayaas ke baad kiya tha
 According to this, every person in the society has a character to play
 praja ke ek vyakti ko raja ke adeshon kaa paalan karnaa chahie or apane parivaar, samaaj or desh ke prati apana daayitv nibhaana chahie
 The king should be sensible and virtuous and should run his rule in an orderly fashion
 samaaj main koi unchaa or koi nicha to hota hi he, isliye is sachai se ladane kaa koi faaydaa nahin, lekin yah zaruri he ki sabhi apane dharm kaa paalan thik se karen
 It is not right for anyone to be arbitrary and one should try to make a man a gentleman
 nyaayawad kii vichaardhaara haan feizi or lee si ne kii viksit kii thi
 According to him, the basic nature of human being is selfish and can never be changed
 isliye samaaj ko suvyavasthit rakhane ke liye kade kaanoonon kii aavashyaktaa he jinhen sakhti se lagu kiya jaae
 For jurists the interest of the nation and the state is more than the interest of the citizens
 isliye zaruri he ki rajya sampann or shaktishaalee ho bhale nagarikon ko kitna hi mushkil jivan hi kyon na jeena pade
 The Han dynasty and the subsequent Chinese dynasties governed their principles, combining Confucianism and jurism
 yahi mishran 19veen sadi tak china kii sarkaar kaa maargdarshan karata rahaa
 Taoism became the second most influential ideology of China
 iske mul siddhant lao-tsu naam ke sant ne ujagar kiye, jo kanceyushious se bhi pehle jivit the
 It was also developed by Zhuangzi
 jahaan kanceyushious-vaad main kisi vyakti ko uske samaaj main rishton ke aadhaar par parkhaa jaataa tha vahaan taowad ne kaha kii kisi bhi vyakti ko prakruti ke saath miljul kar rahanaa chahie
 Taoism says that the entire universe is flowing in a stream and should form part of that stream
 mohivaad ek moji naamak guru ke bhakton kii vichaardhaara thi
 This ideology was completely crushed in the Chin dynasty and lost its influence in China, but before that it was considered to be a collision of Confucianism
 iske anusaar vyakti ko sabase prem karnaa chahie or ishwar kii nazar main sabhi barabaar hai
 a human being should live a simple life and, according to Mohism, the customs and songs that are given importance in Confucianism are worthless
 janata ko samraat kii ajna kaa paalan karnaa chahie or samraaton ko divya siddhanton kaa
 Government servants should be appointed to the best of their ability, not on the basis of their family ties
 yuddh bahut buree chiz he or kabhi nahin karnaa chahie
 It is enough to keep the army strong for your defense
