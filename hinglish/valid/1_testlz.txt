yah vyavhaarik manovigyaan kii shakha he jo shikshan evam seekhney kii prakriya ko sudhaarney main prayasarat he
 Education psychology is the legislative science that discusses, analyzes and solves the problems of education
 shiksha, manovigyaan se kabhi pruthak nahin rahi he
 Psychology, whether it has been in the form of philosophy, has helped to develop the person through education
 naveen binwal ke anusaar : shiksha manovigyaan, shaikshanik paristhitiyon main maanviya vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he
 Education psychology derives its meaning from education, which is social process and psychology, which is behavioral science
 Amit kumar ke anusaar : shiksha manovigyaan, vyakti ke janm se lekar vriddhavastha tak seekhney ke anubhavon kaa varnan tathaa vyakhya karata he
 According to Manzoor ahmad: Education psychology is that branch of applied psychology which deals with the application of psychological principles and discoveries in education as well as psychological study of the problems of education
 lala ji ke anusaar : shaikshik manovigyaan maanav pratikriyaaon ke shikshan or seekhney ko prabhavit vaigyanik drushti se vyutpann siddhanton ke anuprayog kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 In India, education is interpreted with knowledge
 gandhi ji ke anusaar shiksha kaa taatpary vyakti ke sharir, man or aatma ke samuchit vikaas se he
 To analyze the meaning of education psychology, Skinner has indicated the following facts: - kaili ne shiksha manovigyaan kii aavashyaktaa ko nimnanusaar bataaya haih- Regarding the field of education psychology, Skinner has written that in the field of education psychology, it is related to all the knowledge and techniques that are related to explaining the learning process better and determining it more efficiently
 aadhunik shiksha manovigyaanikon ke anusaar shiksha manovigyaan ke pramukh kshetra nimna prakaar he- Psychology is helpful in solving important problems of education and all these problems and their solutions become the domain of education psychology - keli ne shiksha manovigyaan ke kaaryo kaa nimna prakaar vishleshan kiya he - Education psychology is concerned with learning and learning methods
 shiksha tathaa manovigyaan gyaan kii do spasht shakhaaen he, parantu in dono kaa paraspar ghanishtha sambandh hai aadhunik shiksha kaa aadhaar manovigyaan he
 The child is educated by carefully studying his interests, trends, possibilities and personality
 aaj shiksha tathaa manovigyaan ek duusare ke poorak he
 Skinner Skinner opines that "education is a necessity of psychology education"
 isaki sahaayta ke bina shiksha kii gutthi sulajhaai nahin ja sakati
 Both education and psychology are concerned with behavior
 manovigyaan kii khojon kii shiksha ke duusare pahaluon par gahari chhap he
 '' shiksha tathaa manovigyaan siddhant tathaa vyavhaar kaa samanvay he, shiksha tathaa manovigyaan kaa parsparik sambandh kaa gyaan maanav ke samanvit santulit vikaas ke liye aavashyak he
 Similar work in education is based on the principles of psychology
 kro and kro ke anusaar ‘‘manovigyaan, vaataavaran ke sampark main hone vaale maanav vyavhaaron kaa vigyaan hai’’ manovigyaan seekhney se sambandhit maanav vikaas kii vyakhya karata he
 Education provides an effort to carry out the learning process
 shiksha manovigyaan seekhney ke kyon or kab se sambandhit he
 '' shiksha or manovigyaan ko jodne vaali kadi he ‘‘maanav vyavhaar’’
 The views of two scholars in this regard are visible: - brown- ‘‘shiksha vah prakriya he jiske dwaara vyakti ke vyavhaar main parivartan kiya jaataa he
 '' pilsbari- ‘‘manovigyaan maanav vyavhaar kaa vigyaan he
 '' in paribhaashaon se spasht he ki shiksha or manovigyaan donon kaa sambandh maanav vyavhaar se he
 Education changes human behavior and makes it perfect
 manovigyaan maanav vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he
 Thus, it is natural to have a relationship between education and psychology, but in this regard it provides the basis for psychology
 shiksha ko apane prayek kaary ke liye manovigyaan kii sweekruti praapt kerani padati he
 Bn Jha has rightly written - "whatever education does and the way it is done, it has to depend on psychological discoveries
 ’’ Psychology has gained this place because it has revolutionized all fields of education by influencing them
 is sandarbh main rain ke ye sargarbhit vaakya ullekhneey he- All this has been possible due to the use of education psychology
 sankshep main manovigyaan ne shiksha ke kshetra main nimnlikhit yogadan kiya he- The problems of education are related to its objectives, subject matter, means and methods
 manovigyaan in chaaron kshetron main samasyaon ko sulajhane main sahaayta pradaan karata he
 Psychology helps in understanding the objectives of education as follows
 shiksha kii vishaywastu ko samajhane va uskaa nirdhaaran chaatr ke vikaas ke anuroop karne main manovigyaan kaa mahatvapurn yogadan hota hai
 What is the content for which class of students? What kind of indirect course that does not adversely affect the mental health of students, etc
 Psychology addresses important questions
 manovigyaan kii sahaayta se maanavjaati ko vishwa ke kalyaan hetu prayukt kar sakate he
 Psychology helps in understanding the means of education, because- manovigyaan shikshan kii vidhiyon ke bare main gyaan teen prakaar se detaa he - Davis has discussed the importance of education psychology in this way - psychology has contributed significantly in the field of education by analyzing students' aptitudes and the variations found in them
 isane vidyalayan varsho main chaatr kii vruddhi evam vikaas ke dhang ke bare main gyaan pradaan karke bhi yogadan diya he
 Blair has stated the importance of education psychology in the following words - vibhinn lekhakon ne shiksha manovigyaan kii bhinn-bhinn paribhaashaayen di he
 Therefore, certainly nothing can be said about the field of education psychology
 iske atirikt shiksha manovaigyanik ek nayaa tathaa panapata vigyaan he
 Its field is uncertain and assumptions are secret
 iske kshetron main abhi bahut si khoj ho rahi he or sambhav he ki shiksha manovigyaan kii nai dharanaen, niyam or siddhant praapt ho jaye
 Its sense is that the field of education psychology and problems are uncertain and variable
 chaahe kuch bhi ho nimnlikhit kshetra yaa samasyaon ko shiksha manovigyaan ke kaary kshetra main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Crow and Crow - "the content of education psychology is related to the conditions affecting learning
 ’’ Education psychology is being placed in the category of behavioral sciences
 vigyaan hone ke kaaran iske adhyayan main bhi anek vidhiyon kaa vikaas hua
 These methods are scientific
 george e lundburg ke shabdon main - The methods commonly used for study and research in education psychology can be divided into two parts: - inamen se kuch pramukh vidhiyon kaa nimnanusaar varnan kiya gaya he :- The method of self-inspection is also known as insight, internal inspection method
 stout ke anusaar ‘‘apana maansik kriyaaon kaa krambaddh adhyayan hi anternirikshan kehalaata he
 Woodworth called this method introspection
 is vidhi main vyakti kii maansik kriyaayein aatmagat hoti he
 Being introspective, introspection or insight method is more useful
 lock ke anusaar - mastishk dwaara apni swayan kii kriyaaon kaa nirikshan
 Person study method is used by psychologists for mental patients, criminals and people doing anti-social work
 bahudhaa manovaigyanik kaa anek prakaar ke vyaktiyon se paala padataa he
 Among them, there is a criminal, a mental patient, a quarrel, an anti-social worker and a problem child
 manovaigyanik ke vichaar se vyakti kaa bhautik, paariwarik va saamaajik vaataavaran usamen maansik asantulan utpann kar detaa he
 As a result, he starts behaving undesirable
 iskaa vaastavik kaaran jaanane ke liye vah vyakti ke purv itihaas kii kadiyon ko jodta he
 For this purpose, the person visits his parents, teachers, relatives, neighbors, friends etc
 and inquires
 is prakaar vah vyakti ke vanshanukram, paariwarik or saamaajik vaataavaran, ruchiyon, kriyaaon, shaareerik swasthya, shaikshik or samvegatmak vikaas ke sambandh main tathy ekatra karata he jinke falswaroop vyakti manovikaron kaa shikaar banakar anuchit aacharan karne lagata he
 Thus the purpose of this method is to discover the cause of a person's specific behavior
 kro va kro ne likhaa he ‘‘jivan itihaas vidhi kaa mukhya uddeshy kisi kaaran kaa nidaan karnaa he
 '' bahirdarshan vidhi ko avlokan yaa nirikshan vidhi bhi kaha jaataa he
 The common meaning of observation or observation is to look carefully
 ham kisi ke vyavhaar,aacharan evam kriyaaon, pratikriyaaon aadi ko baahar se dhyanpurvak dekhakar uski aantarik manahosthiti kaa anumaan laga sakate he
 For example: If a person is speaking loudly and his eyes are red then we can know that he is in anger
 kisi vyakti ko hansata hua dekhakar uske khush hone kaa anumaan laga sakate hai
 In the inspection method, the inspector observes the behavior being studied and based on that, he makes his perception about the subject
 vyavahaarwadiyon ne is vidhi ko vishesh mahatv diya he
 According to Kolesnik, there are two types of inspection - aupchaarik nirikshan niyantrit dashaon main or anaupchaarik nirikshan aniyantrit dashaon main kiya jaataa he
 Informal inspection of these is more useful for the teacher
 use kaksha or kaksha ke baahar apane chaatro ke vyavhaar kaa nirikshan karne ke liye anek avasar praapt hote he
 On the basis of this observation, he can gain knowledge of the norms of their behavior and give them suitable directions
 good tathaa hat ke anusaar - "saamanytah prashnawali shabdic prashnon ke uttar praapt karne kii vidhi he, jisamen vyakti ko swayan hi praaroop main bharkar dene hote hai
 In this method, it is important to collect the facts related to the problem by obtaining answers to the questions
 prashnawali ek prakaar se likhit prashnon kii yojanabaddh suchi hoti he
 In this, either space is kept for possible answers or possible answers are written
 " In this method, it is important to collect the facts related to the problem by meeting the people
 is vidhi ke dwaara vyakti kii samasyaon tathaa gunon kaa gyaan praapt kiya jaataa he
 In this, two persons have a face-to-face verbal conversation, through which an attempt is made to find solutions to the problems of the person and to gain knowledge of physical and mental conditions
 good evam hat ke shabdon main - kisi uddeshy se kiya gaya gambheer vaartalap hi saakshaatkaar he
 "study of human behavior in predetermined conditions
" ’’ vidhi main prayogkarta swayan apane dwaara nirdhaarit kii hui paristhitiyon yaa vaataavaran main kisi vyakti ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he yaa kisi samasya ke sambandh main tathy ekatra karata he
 "treating the person's unconscious mind by studying
" ’’ is vidhi ke dwaara vyakti ke achetan man kaa adhyayan karke, uski atrupt ichchhaaon kii jaankaree praapt kii jaati he
 Thereafter, the person is treated by refining or modifying those desires and thus an attempt is made to make his behavior perfect
 inhen bhi dekhen: apraroopik triprishthi tantrikashul Trigeminal neuralgia, tick dulurex is a neuropathy disorder characterized by extreme pain episodes
 ek yaa do triprishthi tantrikaon main utpann hone vaale is dard ko chehre ke ek taraf or iske saath-saath inamen se kisi yaa sabhi main mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he: kaan, aankh, hont, naak, khopadi, lalaat, baayin tarjani, daant, yaa jabada; is par kaabo paanaa yaa ise thik karnaa aasaan nahin he
 It is estimated that one in 15,000 people suffer from trigeminal neuralgia, although the actual figure may be significantly higher due to frequent erroneous diagnosis
 adhikansh maamalon main, tien ke lakshan 50 varsh kii umr ke baad dikhaai dene lagate hai, haalanki aise bhi kuch maamle saamne aae hai jinamein rogiyon kii kam se kam umr teen saal thi
 It occurs mostly in women
 
 TN causes pain like stinging and numbness in the brain; This can happen due to touching of the affected area, but in many patients, this pain occurs spontaneously without any apparent stimulation
 thandi hawa, atyadhik peach vaali dhwani, bahut zyada shor, jaise - sangeet kaarykram yaa bheed se utpann hone vaali dhwani, chabane or baat karne se haalat or kharaab ho sakati he
 Even the pain caused by smiling, wearing a scarf, or feeling air or hair on the face can be very difficult to bear
 chunki is atyadhik dard par aam taur par ilaaj kii koi vishesh pratikriya nahin hoti he, isliye in maamalon main aatmahatya ek bahut hi aam pratikriya he
 Significantly, Bollywood actor Salman Khan also had this disease for which he underwent surgery
 is vikaar ko atyadhik anani dard kii prasangon dwaara abhilakshyit kiya jaataa he jo kuch second se laakar kai minute yaa ghante rah saktaa he
 Considerations of extreme pain can occur in the form of a stimulus
 dard kii anubhuti kaa varnan karne ke liye rogi chahare par ek satarkta kshetra kaa varnan kar sakate hai jo itnaa samvedansheel hota he ki chooney yaa yahaan tak ki hawa kii dhaaraon se bhi phir se dard uth saktaa he
 It affects lifestyles because it can be activated by common activities such as eating, talking, shaving, and brushing teeth
 kaha jaataa he ki jin logon ko yah dard uthta he unhen bijli ke jatke, jalane, dabane, kuchalane, fatne yaa goli daage jane jaise dard kaa ehsaas hota he jise sahanaa unke liye mushkil ho jaataa he
 The pain that usually arises in one place affects one side of the face at a time, which lasts from several seconds to a few minutes and is repeated hundreds of times throughout the day
 yah dard dheelaapan ke saath chakra main bhi hota he jo maheenon yahaan tak ki saalon tak rahata he
 10 to 12 percent of cases involve bilateral, or both-side pain
 yah saamaanya rup se donon triprishthi tantrikaon kii samasyaon kaa sanket detaa he kyonki ek kadai se chehre ke baayin taraf or doosraa daayin taraf kaam karata he
 Over time, the condition gets worse or more serious due to repeated rise of pain
 kai rogiyon kii tantrikaon kii ek shakha main dard hota he, uske baad varshon bitne par yah dard tantrikaon kii anya shakhaon main chalaa jayega
 Signs that are visible from outside TN can sometimes be seen in men who may intentionally leave an area of their face at the time of shaving to prevent the episode from triggering
 dard ke baar-baar uthne se rogi bebas ho jaataa he or dard uthne ke dar kii vajah se rogi apane saamaanya dainik karmon ko karne main asamarth ho saktaa he
 There is also a variant of trigeminal neuralgia which is called non-peritoneal trigeminal neuralgia
 apraroopik triprishthi tantrikashul ke kuch maamalon main rogi ko ardhakapali kii tarah gambhir, ashaant anternihit dard hota he or saath main chhura ghonpane or bijli ke jatke kii tarah ke dard kaa ehsaas hota he
 This variation is often referred to as "trigeminal neuralgia, type 2" based on a recent classification of pain
 anya maamalon main, chhura ghonpane jaisaa bahut zyada dard bijli ke jatke ke bajaay jalan yaa siharan jaisaa mahasoos ho saktaa he
 Sometimes this pain is a mixed form of Satyaktrani like an electric shock, Ardhakpali-like pain and burning or shivering pain
 aisa bhi lag saktaa he jaise koi ubaau chid daalane vaala dard asay hota ja rahaa he
 According to some recent studies, ATN may be an early development of trigeminal neuralgia
 triprishthi tantrika paanchvaan kapaly tantrika naamak ek mishrit kapaly tantrika he jo jabade kii rekha se upar chahare se utpann hone vaale tactishan, thermosepshan or nosicepshan jaise samvedi aankadon ke liye jimmedaar hota he; yah chabane kii kriya main, na ki anani abhivyakti main, bhaag lene vaali mansapeshiyon arthath charvan mansapeshiyon kii motor kriya ke liye bhi jimmedaar hota he
 Several theories exist to explain the possible causes of this pain syndrome
 pehle yah mana jaataa tha ki khopadi ke andruni muhane se lekar bahari muhane tak tantrika sankuchit hota tha; lekin nutan agrani anusandhan ingit karata he ki yah ek vardhit rakt vahini - sambhawatah shreshth anumastishkeey dhamni - he or pons ke saath iske sangyojan ke paas triprishthi tantrika ke microwasculechar ke khilaaf sankuchit yaa spandit kar detaa he
 Such a compression can injure the protective myelin sheath of the nerve and cause uncertain and hyperactive function of the nerve
 iske falswaroop tantrika ke kaam karne vaale kisi bhi kshetra kii thodi si bhi uttejnaa se phir se dard uth saktaa he or iske saath hi saath uttejan samaapt hone ke baad dard ke sanketon ko band karne kii tantrika kii kshamta main bhi baadha utpann ho sakati he
 Such injury is rarely by aneurysm; By tumor; By a cerebrospinal membrane cyst in the angle related to cerebellum and ponses verolai; Or a traumatic event, such as a car accident or even tongue piercing
 adhikansh bahukathinya rogiyon ko tien kii shikaayat hoti he, lekin har tien rogi ko emes kii shikaayat nahin hoti
 keval do se chaar pratishat tien rogiyon, khaas taur par yuva rogiyon, ko bahukathinya kii shikaayat hoti he, jo triprishthi tantrika yaa mastishk ke anya sambandhit bhaagon ko kshatigrast kar saktaa he
 This leads to the theory that this happens because of the destruction of the complex trigeminal stem
 emes grast or mukt rogiyon main ek samaan triprishthi dard hota he
 Similar symptoms can occur if the trigeminal neuralgia, which occurs after shingles, is damaged if the trigeminal nerve is damaged
 jab koi sanrachanaatmak kaaran nahin hota he, to is sanglakshan ko agyatahetuk kaha jaataa he
 Unfortunately TN is sometimes misdiagnosed due to a number of circumstances with no clear physical or laboratory diagnosis
 kabhi-kabhi ek tien peedit ek sakht nidaan se pehle kai chikitsakon kii madad maang saktaa he
 There is evidence that points to the need to quickly treat and diagnose trigeminal neuralgia
 logon kaa vichaar he ki jitna zyada din tak rogi tien se peedit rahata he, dard se jude tantrika margon ko badalanaa utana hi mushkil ho saktaa he
 Dentists suspected of TN should proceed in the most conservative manner possible and make sure that all the structures of the tooth are "literally" aligned before performing extraction or other procedures
 kai rogi saalon tak dawaaiyon ko bardaasht nahin kar sakate hai or ek vaikalpik ilaaj gabappentin jaisi kisi dawa ko lenaa or ise baahar se lagaana he
 This preparation is prepared by drug dealers without any prior preparation
 jab aadat chhootane lagati he to ek "dawa avkaash diwas" lenaa or yadi koi aprabhavi ho jaataa he to dawaaon ko doharaana bhi sahaayak sabit hota he
 Surgery may be suggested to selectively damage the nerve with the intention of relieving pressure or blocking the passage of pain signals reaching the brain
 prashikshit haathon se kii jane vaali shalyachikitsa ke armbh main 90 pratishat tak safal hone kii khabar mili he
 However, if the pain again arises, some patients have to undergo further procedures
 paanch shalyachikitsiya vikalpon main se, sookshmaraktvahini visampidan, jise janeta prakriya ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, ekmaatr aisa vikalp he jiskaa lakshya dard ke prakalpit kaaran ko nirdhaarit karnaa he
 In this procedure, the surgeon enters the skull through a 25-millimeter orifice located behind the ear

 MVD procedures can prove to be a permanent pain reliever if proven successful and there is little or no anesthesia at all
 teen anya prakriyaaon main sui yaa catheter kaa istemaal hota he jo chehre ke madhyam se us sthaan main pravesh karata he jahaan tantrika pehali baar teen bhaagon main bant jaati he
 Excellent success rates have been reported with the use of a cost-effective cutaneous surgical procedure known as balloon compression
 is rog ke saath anya swasthya rogon yaa paristhitiyon kii vajah se jin bujurg rogiyon kii shalya chikitsa nahin kii ja sakati he unke ilaaj main yah takanic sahaayak sabit ho saktaa he
 Balloon compression is also the best option for patients who have pain in the nerves of the eye or who have experienced recurrent pain after microvascular decompression
 glissrol injection or radiophriquency rizotomi ke saath bhi isi tarah kii safalataa dar kii khabar mili he
 a process involving glycerol injection involves an alcohol-like substance entering an orifice that engages the nerve near its junction
 yah taral padaarth tantrika ke reshon kaa sanksharak he or yah tantrika ko jaraa sa kshatigrast kar saktaa he jo gumraah dard sanketon ko baadhit karne ke liye kaaphi hota he
 In a radiofrequency rhizotomy, the surgeon uses an electrode to heat the selective part or parts of the nerve
 acchhee tarah se kiye jane par yah prakriya gumraah dard uttejkon ke sateek kshetron ko lakshyit kar sakati he or nunatam samvedanshoonyata ke saath unhen niskriy kar detii he
 Preventing pain signal transmission using gamma knife or a linear accelerator based radiation therapy can also damage the nerve
 is prakriya main koi chira shaamil nahi he
 It uses precisely targeted radiation to attack the nerve root, this time targeting selective damage at the same location where blood vessel compression is often found
 is vikalp kaa istemaal khaas taur par un logon ke liye kiya jaataa he jo chikitsa kii drushti se ek dirghakaalik saamaanya samvednahari ke liye anukool nahin hote hai, yaa jo log rakt jamaav kii rokthaam ke liye davaaiyaan le rahe hai
 a prospective Phase One trial conducted in Marseille, France showed that 83 percent of patients were pain free in 12 months and 58 percent of patients were pain free with medicines
 iske dushprabhav bahut kam the, 6 pratishat rogiyon ne halki si jhunjhuni kaa anubhav kiya or 4 pratishat rogiyon ne halki si samvedanheenata kaa anubhav kiya
 There is only one future clinical trial for trigeminal neuralgia surgery
 ek bhavi samuhik pareekshan main, triprishthi tantrikashul ke rogiyon main ek dard mukt sthiti ko praapt karne or use banaae rakhane main sookshmaraktvahini visampidan ko steriotactic radiosurgery se kaaphi behatar paaya gaya he or steriotactic radiosurgery kii sahaayta se ilaaj karaane vaale rogiyon kii tulana main isse ilaaj karaane vaale rogiyon ko isi tarah kii aarambhik or behatar dirghakaalik santushti praapt hui he
 Most people with TN present no visible symptoms, although some may experience brief spasms on their faces during an attack
 kuch chikitsak, shaareerik vishmata ke bajaay manovaigyanik jad kii talash kar sakate hai
 This is especially true for those suffering from uncomplicated TN, who may have no compression of TN, and in whom the only diagnostic criterion may be a complaint of severe pain, and in this case trigeminal neuralgia
 Also exist but it may not be visible to the doctors as it can cause damage during dental procedure like root canal, extraction, gum surgery
 This was caused by a nerve occurring or it may be a secondary condition of multicollinearity
 tien se peedit kai log apane gharon tak hi simit rahete hai yaa dard ke baar-baar uthne kii vajah se kaam nahin kar pate hai
 Friends and family should be aware of the extreme severity of TN pain and understand its limitations
 haalanki, usee samay, tien ke rogi ko apane punarvaas prayaason ko aage badhaane main bahut zyada sakriy hona chahie
 Enrolling in a long-term pain support group or seeking one-on-one counseling may help a TN patient learn ways to reconcile with this newly acquired grief
 jahaan tak kisi dirghakaalik dard sanglakshan kaa sawaal he, naidanik avsaad ke sthapit hone kii sambhaavna rahati he, vishesh rup se kam umr ke rogiyon main jinke dirghakaalik dard kaa aksar laaparvaahee se ilaaj kiya jaataa he

 In March 1881, after heavy lobbying by the residents of Los Angeles, the California State Legislature authorized the Southern Branch of the California State Normal School to open a branch in the downtown Los Angeles commercial area to allow teachers for Southern California's growing population To be trained
 The State Normal School in Los Angeles opened on August 29, 1882, at which place now stands the Central Library of the Los Angeles Government Library

 1887 main, vah skool los angeles state normal skool naam se janaa jane laga
 In 1914, the school moved to a new campus on Vermont Avenue, Hollywood
 In 1917, UC Regent Edward A
 Dixon, then the lone Regent representing Southland, and Ernest Carroll Moore, who was the director of the Normal School, began to lobby together in the state legislature to allow the school to head to the California campus , Allow us to build a second university after Berkeley
 Berkeley alumni, members of the Northern California State Legislative Assembly, and Benjamin Eyed Wheeler, who was president of the University of California from 1899 to 1919, strongly opposed the idea of a southern campus
 david presscott barros, jo california vishvavidhyalay ke nae raashtrapati niyukt hue, unhen whealer ke saamaan koi aapatti nahin thi
 On 23 May 1919, the hard work of the Southern California came to light when Governor William D
 Stephens signed Legislative Bill 626 and legislated it, which changed the campus to the Southern Branch of the University of California and added a general undergraduate program, also named College of Letters and Science

 phir bhi khel ke kai tatv age of empyrez kii tarah samaan hai
 Its expedition introduces an Atlantean navalist, Arcantos, who is obliged to travel through the three cultures of the game to hunt for the monstrous monster that accompanies Poseidon's union against Atlantis

 Critical acceptance of the game was generally positive: it scored 89% on the order of the games category and on Metacritic
 age of mithology kii teen sabhyataaen unani, mishra or norse hai
 All have different mechanics
 udhaaharan ke liye unani apane gaanv vaasiyon ko mandir main prarthana karvaa ke samarthan praapt karte hai, mishra vaasi bhinn smarakon kaa nirmaan karke tathaa norse ladaai or shikaar kar ke aisa karte hai
 Greek civilization is very similar to the civilizations of the Age of Kings
 inke paas mahaan prahari hai, kyonki ve ghudsavaar fouj se shuruyaat karte hai or ve pegasy prahariyon ko prashikshit kar sakate hai
 They train their units in training schools, archery centers and stables
 inaki insaani ikai duusari sabhyataaon ke mukaable kaaphi majboot hoti hai, par ye kaaphi mahange hote hai
 Their heroes are much more powerful than Greek myths, such as Thessius, Herakles, Odysseus, or Akilis
 Of these, you can find only one, but if they have died, you can train them again
 ye akeli sabhyataa he jiske paas tisare yug petroboli ke liye bhinn prakaar ke gheraabandi ke hathiyaar hai
 In the fourth era, they can train powerful Helleapolis towers

 Their pharaoh is an independent hero unit, which if killed, will be replaced by someone else
 ve utpaada ko teji pradaan karne ke liye bhawanon ko shaktishaalee bana sakate hai

 unke gheraabandi ke hathiyaar bahut shaktishaalee hai or unke paas yuddh ke hathi bhi hai jo ki bhawanon ko dhwast kar sakate hai yaa paidal sena ko parajeet kar sakate hai
 Norse are quite aggressive: they can train soldiers in the first era, but they do not have arrows
 It is also their infantry that build buildings, which gives their hoarders a chance to focus on the accumulation of resources
 bhandar bhawanon ko banane ke bajaay, norse bail gadiyon ko shahar mukhyalay main prashikshit kar sakate hai jo gatisheel bhandar hote hai
 Their hero is Hersir, who can be trained in a long house or a temple

 zyaadaatar ikaayiyon kaa unnayan ho saktaa he, jo ki unhen vishisht kaaryon ke liye behatar banaata he
 Units can be divided into seven categories; Infantry, archers, cavalry, siege weapons, navy units, heroes and mythical units
 rock-paper-caesars operates model combat units
 udhaaharan ke liye, paidal sena ghudsavaar fouj ko atirikt haani pahunchaati he, ghudsavaar fouj teerandaajon ko atirikt haani pahunchaati hai or teerandaz atirikt haani paidal sena ko pahunchaate hai
 At the same time every unit has a "counter unit", which, instead of following the usual weak and powerful framework, the counter unit has a bonus attack against a unit type of its own
 nahin to vah samaan hi rahata he, jaise samaan kamajori or duusari ikai ke liye koi bonus nahin or koi kamajori nahin
 The same rock-paper-service format exists for three different types of naval forces - arrow ships, siege ships, and hammer ships
 The siege units are generally free from rock-paper-sissured specimens, instead they are able to demolish buildings, while cavalry troops are vulnerable to attacks
 nayak, myth ikaayiyon ke khilaaf atyant prabhavakaari hote hai, aisa maanav ikaayiyon kii vishaal maatr main haani kii vajah se hota he
 The heroes are able to collect the memento, which translates the player into extra meanings and military bonuses when they are deposited in the player's temple
 haalanki nayak saamanytah maanav ikaayiyon se adhik shaktishaalee hote hai, phir bhi mithkeey ikaayiyon or duusare maanav ikaayiyon ke istemaal ke mukaable zyada kharchile hote hai
 Buildings in the Age of Mythology can generally be divided into three categories: economic buildings, military buildings and defensive buildings
 The most important economic building is the headquarters of the city, which is similar to the building of the same name in the Games of the Age of Empires
 vyapaar kafile, machhlee pakadaney ke jahaaj or kuch takneekon ke alaava sabhi asainik ikaayiyon kaa prashikshan shahar mukhyalay main hi hota he

 The city headquarters offers fifteen population slots, and on the construction of new houses, the player can get an additional 10 slots per house
 duusare aarthik bhawan main khet or bazaar shaamil hai
 The buildings are capable of researching technological upgrades, as well as providing resources to the player
 asainik or vyaper ke kaphilon ke prashikshan ko chhodkar anya sabhi ikayon kaa prashikshan sainya bhawan main hota he
 These buildings differ between civilizations by name and usage, but all are capable of training a similar unit
 sainya bhawanon kaa prayog sainya vinirdisht takneekon, hathiyaaron ke unnayan tathaa akraman main behatari ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Walls and towers are protective structures that cannot undergo training and are used for safety purposes only
 ve kuch unnyanon kaa shodh karne main samarth hote hai, haalanki inkaa mahatv keval bhawan ke shodh ke liye hi hota he
 The second type of buildings that are available to players is a Wonder: a magnificent building that represents the architectural and architectural achievement of civilization

 ; In "lighting", the game strategy is similar to that of Supremacy, but in this the player plays twice as fast as normal, taking the villagers in range; In the "nomad" type, the player starts with a civilian unit and has no city headquarters, and is required to grow at the location; The purpose of "king of the Hill" is to control a monument in the middle of the map for a certain period of time; And in "sudden Death", a player is defeated if the city headquarters is demolished and they cannot build it within the stipulated period
 Multi-player contests and LAN circles are famous worldwide, with many players accessing computer game lounges to participate

 Depp was attracted to the story because he found it bizarre: Instead of trying to find the treasure, the Black Pearl crew was trying to return it to remove his curse; And the traditional rebellion had already taken place
 verbinski ne rash ko barbosa kii bhoomika ke liye sampark kiya, kyonki vah jaanate the kii vah ise jatilta ke prayaas se nahin balki saral khalnaayaki se nibhaayenge jo kahani ke swar ke anukool hoga

 Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rozio knew that with an ensemble actor class they were not free to create completely different positions and actors, as happened with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and therefore The Curse of The Black Pearl had to make the first of the composition triad according to prior activity
 They wanted to find out what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace at the end of the first film and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as a plot device

 Myth of hell pracheen puraakathaon kaa tatva jo naveen sthitiyon main naye arth kaa vahan kare myth kehalaata he

 is arth main myth ek hi samay main manushya ke algaav ko pratibimbit karte hai or us algaav se jo pidaa utpann hoti he, usase mukti bhi dilaate hai
 The nostalgia of being integral with nature, the flurry of primary memory, the dream of rejoining the eternal and eternal, these emotions play the most powerful role in making myth possible

 hindu mahakavy ramayana main is dhanush kaa ullekh he, jab shri ram ise janak kii putree sita ko apni patni ke rup main jeetne ke liye bhang karte hai
 According to one legend, Pinaka is the original bow of Lord Shiva to be used for destruction or "holocaust"
 mul valmiki ramayana ke anusaar, bhagwaan devendra dwaara samaan kshamta ke do dhanush banaae gaye the jo unhone rudra or bhagwaan vishnu ko de die or unase yah anurodh kiya ki donon aapas main yuddh karen jisase gyaat ho sake ki unamem se shaktishaalee koun he
 But just before the start of the war, there was a call that this war would lead to destruction and hence this war was stopped
 akashwani hone par rudra ne dhanush phenk diya jo prithvi par gir gaya jise baad main "shivadhanush" kaha gaya
 This bow was found on Earth by King Devrath, the ancestor of King Janaka
 hindu mahakavy ramayana main iskaa ullekh he, jab shri ram ise janak kii putree sita ko apni patni ke rup main jeetne ke liye bhang karte hai
 According to the second story, Lord Vishwakarma prepared two divine bows
 jinamein ek kaa naam shaarang tathaa duusare kaa naam pinaak tha
 He gave Sharang to Lord Vishnu and Pinaka to Lord Shiva
 mithila ke raja janak kii sita naam kii beti thi
 In her childhood, while playing with her sisters, Sita inadvertently lifted the table on which the Shiva rainbow was placed; Which no one else in the state could raise
 is ghatana ko janak ne dekha or unhone sita ke swayamvar ke liye is ghatana ko prishthbhumi ke rup main banane kaa faisla kiya
 Later, Janaka announces that whoever wants to marry Sita will have to lift this divine bow and offer it
 ayodhya ke rajkumaar ram ne hi yah dhanush pratyanchit kiya or sita se vivaah kiya
 After his marriage, when his father Dasaratha was returning to Ayodhya with Rama, Parashurama blocked his path and challenged Rama to break the bow of his Guru Shiva
 ram ne dhanush ko bhang kar diya 
 At this Dasharatha prayed to the sage Parashurama to forgive him but Parashurama was even more enraged and took Vishnu's bow Sharang and asked Rama to tie the bow and fight a duel with him
 ram ne vishnu ke dhanush shaarang ko liya, ise bandha, isamen ek baan lagaaya or us baan ko parashuram kii ore ingit kiya
 Rama then asked Parshuram what he would aim for the arrow
 is par, parashuram swayan ko apni rahasyamay urja se rahit maanate hai
 He realizes that Rama is the incarnation of Vishnu
 pinaak ke bare main ek or katha bhagwaan vishnu or bhagwaan shiv ke madhya yuddh par aadhaarit he, jo ramayana ke baalkand ke pachattaraven sarg main varnit he
 Parashurama told this story to Lord Rama before challenging him to extradite Sharang
 kahani is tarah he- devtaa bhagwaan vishnu or bhagwaan shiv kii shreshthata kaa pareekshan karnaa chaahate the ki un donon main se adhik shreshth koun he
 He then asked Lord Brahma to create differences between them
 yuddh main, bhagwaan vishnu ne bhagwaan shiv or devataaon ko parajeet kiya
 Lord Shiva's bow pinak became useless and Lord Vishnu's bow Sharang became dominant
 yah dhanush pinaak baad main bhagwaan ram dwaara todaa gaya tha
 Lord Rama also took Sharang from Parashurama and gave it to Varuna, the god of the ocean, to keep it safe
 yadhyapi puraanon se sandarbh abhi bhi sammilit kiya janaa baaki he, lekin pinaak kaa sambandh maharishi dadhichi ke jivan ke saath he, jinhone vritrasur ko parajeet karne main devataaon kii sahaayta kii or baad main anurodh karne par unhone apane jivan kaa ant kar apni haddiyon se vajra kaa nirmaan kiya jise indra ne daanav vritrasur ko maarane ke liye prayog kiya tha

 The rulers of Awadh in India in the 18th and 19th centuries are called the Nawabs of Awadh

 As Mughal power declined and the power of the emperors decreased
 ve dhire-dhire pehle apane jagiradaaron ke kathputle or antat unke qaidi banate gaye, saath hi saath avadh or shaktishaalee va adhik swadhin hota gaya
 Its capital was Faizabad
 mogul samrajya ke sabhi muslim praanton or adhinsthon main avadh kaa shahi parivaar sabase nayaa tha
 His descendants descended from Saadat Khan, a Persian diler, who was originally from Khorasan region of Persia
 mughalon kii seva main kai koraasaani the, adhiktar sipaahi the or unke safal hone par kaafii daulatmand hone kii ummid rakhi ja sakati thi
 Saadat Khan became the most successful of this group
 1732 main unhen avadh praant kaa jagirdaar bana diya gaya
 He was first given the title of Pahl Nazim, which means Governor, but he was soon made the Nawab
 1740 main nawab ko vazeer arthath mukhya mantri kaha jane laga or iske baad unhen nawab vazeer ke naam se janaa jane laga
 In practice, these titles were hereditary, although on paper they were an offering from the Mughal emperor and confessing loyalty to him
 har saal ek nazar dilli bheji jaati thi or shahi parivaar ke sadasyon kii badi izzat hoti thi: balki do to 1819 ke baad lakhanu main hi rahete the or unhen bade adab ke pesh aayaa jaataa tha
 It is a pity that freedom from the Mughals to a great extent did not mean that the Nawab could govern as he wished
 vastav main ek swami kaa sthaan jagah duusare ne le liya tha
 As the East India Company based in Calcutta, the British had been eyeing the wealth of Awadh for a long time
 is praant main dakhlandaazi ke bahaane khojna koi mushkil nahin tha
 The most painful from Awadh's point of view was the invasion of Bengal by Shuja-ud-daula, after which he also ruled Calcutta for some time
 lekin 1757 main plasi tathaa 1764 main baxur kii ladaai main angrezon kii jeet ke baad nawab puri tarah matiamet ho gaye
 After the war ended, Awadh had lost a lot of its land
 phir bhi satahi taur par hi sahi, dushman dost ban gaye or british sansad main, sampurna bharat main east india company ke pramukh mitra ke taur par nawab vazeer ke taareef ke pul baandhe gaye
 The Darmian Nawab of many years lost his freedom by doing little
 angrez fuj kii suraksha or yuddh main sahaayta kaa kharch chukaane ke liye avadh ne pehle chunaar kaa kila or phir banaras or ghazipur ke jile or phi elahabaad kaa kila de diya
 During this period, the cash assistance given by the Nawab to the company also increased
 1773 main nawab ne lakhanu main british resident sweekaar karne kaa aatmghaatee kadam uthaaya, isaki badaulat videsh niti par sara niyantran company kaa ho gaya
 Soon, despite being formally respected by the Nawab, the actual ruler became a resident
 shujauddula ke putr asafuddaula 1775 main rajdhani faizabad se lakhanu le gaye or unhone lakhanu ko bharat ke sabase rais or chamchamaate shaharon main se ek bana diya
 He is said to have carried out the transfer to avoid his mother's strictures
 lakhanu jaise shahar kii qismat kisi paristhitiyon ne banaai! Nawab Asaf-ud-daula was a compassionate and sensitive ruler, he built many buildings and encouraged the arts
 bhul bhulaia va nikat ke masjid sahit unhone bada imambada banwaaya, ise banavaane kaa mukhya kaaran tha sookhe ke samay apni praja ko rojgaar dilvaanaa
 The Rumi Darwaza also reflects their architectural consciousness
 unke putr, vazeer ali, ko hi apane pitamah dwaara lakhanu main british resident swikaarne ke faisale kaa sabase zyaada afsos hua hoga
 He was removed from the throne by the Governor General in 1798, pretending that there was doubt as to whether he was in fact Asfuddaula's son, but perhaps the real reason for his removal was that he was moving towards autonomy
 unhone asafuddaula ke bhai saadat ali khan ko tajposh kiya
 Saadat Ali Khan managed very well in financial matters, but still did a lot of construction, including Dilkusha, Hayat Baksh and Farhat Baksh and the famous Lal Baradari
 iske baad se uttaradhikaar ke liye yah vansh dilli ke bajaay kalakatta kii ore munh taakane laga
 The assassination of a British resident by Wazir Ali, a remover in Benares in 1798, provided further excuse for interference and Lord Wellesley took full advantage of it
 1801 kii sandhi ke anusaar nawab ko apni fuj kaa tyaag kar ke uske bajaay ek angrezon ke netritv vaali sena kaa baari kharchaa dena padaa
 The southern Doab was given away and the rest of Allahabad and other areas became part of British India
 tees saal main avadh ne apni aadhi zamin angrezon ko de di thi
 In lieu of these concessions, the Nawab demanded open exemption in the rule of the rest of the region, so that there was no scope for the advice and intervention of the British
 lekin isamen dikkat yah thi ki unke nirdeshon kaa kriyanvayan karne ke liye angrezi fuj kii hi zarurat padati
 Wellesley also had another trick: the treaty had a clause under which the administration system should be "based on and in line with the advice of the officers of the venerable company"
 yah dhara yun to nuksandeh nahin lagati thi, par isi ke jariye angrezon ne antat avadh kaa adhigrahan kiya
 From 1819 onwards activities in Awadh would go on
 saadat ali ke dehanth ke baad unke putr gaazi masanad par baithe or unhone ud-deen kii oopaadhi lee, jiskaa arth hota he dharm ke rakshak
 The British formally conferred upon him the title of King, although this was a period when he was completely dependent on the British
 nepal yuddh ke liye unhone angrez firangi ko 20 lakh rupye kaa udhaar diya or aadhe udhaar kii vaapasi ke taur par yuddh ke ant main nepali tarai angrezon se praapt kii - yah himalay parvatamala ke pehle maujuud ek keechad vaala jangal tha
 Some thought the deal was not good, but eventually the Terai produced a lot of valuable wood
 ghaziuddin ek achche shaasha the or unhone kai saarvajanik va bhawan nirmaan kaary kiye, tathaa insaaf dilaane par bhi kaafii dhyaan diya
 He also built Mubarak Manzil, Shah Manzil and Hazari Bagh
 yahan unhone jaanwaron kii ladaaiyon ke khelon se lakhanu ko pehali baar parichit karaayaa
 But his son Nasiruddin, who succeeded him to the throne, was attracted to the British, but not to justice, freedom, democracy, etc
, but to his clothes, food and, regrettably, the drinking habit, There were some bad English companions around him
 nasiruddin, is swabhaav ke baavjood kaafii lokapriy raja the or unhone ek khagoleey centre, taronvali kothi bhi banavaai, jisamen kai nazaakat vaale upkaran the
 It was maintained by an English astronomer
 unki maut ke baad ek or uttaradhikaar yuddh hua, jisamen angrezon ne jor diya ki saadat ali kaa ek or putr, mohammad ali gaddi par baithe
 Mohammad Ali was a just and popular ruler, and under him Lucknow briefly regained its old glory
 lekin ve gathiya se peedit the
 He died in 1842 and his son Amjad Ali became the ruler, tending more towards the religious and religious world, which led to the loosening of the administration
 amjad ali ke baad waajid ali shah aae, ve kavi, gayak, kala ke kadradaan or lakhanu se mohabbat karne vaale the
 It has been written about him, "they are engrossed only in pleasuring the private senses
 unka saarvajanik maamalon main koi rujhaan nahin he or ucch pad ke kartavyon or zimmedaariyon se unhen koi lenaa dena nahin he
 They live only among singers, eunuchs and women, have been like this since childhood and are expected to remain so till the end
 " This description of Wajid Ali Shah was used as an argument for the takeover of Awadh by the British
 yadi waajid ali shah ke khilaaf bad-intazami kaa ilzaam sach tha, to iske liye angrez bhi nawab ke baraabar zimmedaar the
 From the 1780s onwards he had more control over the Prashan and finances of Awadh
 saath hi, angrezon dwaara nawab se lagaataar dhan kii maang se avadh kaafii nirdhan ho chukaa tha
 The British eventually found an excuse to implement the 1801 treaty clause and in 1856 the Governor General Lord Dalhousie was perfectly suited for this task
 avadh kaa adhigrahan hua, waajid ali shah ko kalakatta main matiaburj main lagbhag bandi hi bana diya gaya, haalaanki ye angrezon kii yojana main nahin tha
 The stage for the biggest revolt against the British power in India had been set
 waajid ali shah kii ek patni, begum hazarat mahal lakhanu main hi raheen or jab 1857 main yuddh hua to swadhinata ke liye ladane waalon kii unhone aguai kii

 Chronology or chronology is the science through which we can construct historical events
 isliye yah aavashyak he ki sab ghatnaon ko kisi ek hi sanvatsar main pradarshit kiya jaae
 Only by doing this can we find the sequence of all events and the time span between them
 yah sanvatsar koi bhi ho saktaa he—pracheen yaa arvachin
 Today, most of the year AD is used for this work
 hamaare yahan is kaam ke liye gatkali varsh prayukt hota tha or europe main, pracheen kaal main or kabhi-kabhi aajkal bhi, julian piriad vyavahrut hota he
 Different cultures were prevalent in different countries and diverse periods of the world
 itnaa hi nahin, bharat jaise vishaal desh main aajkal or bhootkaal main bhi bahut se sanwat prachlit the
 The propagation of all these Samvatas started in different periods and their years also started in different seasons
 iske atirikt varsh, maas or dinon kii gananaa kaa prakaar bhi bhinn tha
 Generally, the year was considered to be equivalent to the Riturachakra, but according to the Islamic period, it was only the year of the twelve lunar months, that is, 354 days, which is not the same as the Ritachakra
 kuch varsh chandra or saura ke mishran hote the, jaisaa aajkal bharat ke anek praanton main prachlit he
 It consists of a year of 12 lunar months, but in two or three years, a half-year is increased to make the middle value of the year equal to that of the season cycle
 prayek ritu-chakra-tulya varsh ko saura varsh bhi kehete hai, kyonki uskaa maan surya se sambhddha hota he
 The lunar month we have mentioned above should actually be called the solar moon, because its base is in combination with the sun and the moon
 poornima tak athwa amavasya se amavasya tak is chandramaada kaa maan hota he
 Just as Varshman's imagination is dependent on the seasons and the month's imagery is dependent on the arts of the Moon, similarly the day is conceived from sunrise, sunset, midnight or midnight
 saamanyat: ek madhyahn se aagaamee madhyahn ke madhya kaal ko ek din kehete hai
 Where the lunar month is prevalent, such as in different regions of India, dates are counted, which are primarily related to the arts of the moon
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki jagat ke vividh pradeshon main alag-alag sanwaton se gananaa hoti he, varsh kaa prarambh bhi bhinn-bhinn rituon main hota he or masganana tathaa dinaganana bhi vividh prakaar kii hoti he
 Now, if we read in an ancient inscription that that day was the most auspicious day of so-and-so month, then the question arises as to what day it was
 bahudhaa iskaa uttar paanaa kathin hota he, kyonki us sanwat kaa aarambh kab hua, uskaa varshmaan kya tha or uske maas tathaa din kis prakaar gine jate the, in sab baton kaa gyaan praapt kiye bina ham us din kaa kalnirnay nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, it is necessary that the beginning of different vows of the world, that is, the beginning of their first year, should be told in any one of the certified vows
 jagat main pracheen kaal se aaj tak bahut se sanvatsar chalate aae hai
 The instruction of them all is the subject of a detailed article
 at: parishisht main bharat ke pracheen evam arvachin kuchhek mukhya sanwaton ke prarambh kaa kaal hi denge
 Nowadays there is a system of giving the period of most events in the year AD

 It is the practice of historians that the year before 1 AD was the year 1 BC

 kehete hai—ityadi
 But according to the principles of Mathematics, this practice is unscientific; Because from this, as an example, 3 BC Between 5 and 2 CE, 5 years were spent, there is such confusion, while in reality this gap is only 4 years

 Here we will only describe till the census
 saamaanya manyata yah he ki isvi san isa messiah ke janm se gina jaataa he, parantu katipay vidwaanon ke matanusaar usamen lagbhag 4 varsh kii bhul he
 There is an important context in the calculation of AD, due to which, there is a possibility of mistake of up to 13 days in the census
 aajkal samaanyat: i
 san varsh main 365 din hote hai or prati chaar varshon main ek varsh 366 din kaa hota he
 The 4 centuries have 366 days in just one century in 4 years
 shatabdiyon ke dinon kii yah vishisht vyavastha pracheen kaal main nahi thi
 By 1582 AD, one year per four years was counted as 366 days in all the years including the century
 365 din ke varsh ko saamaanya varsh tathaa 366 din ke varsh ko adhivarsh kehete hai
 In 1582 AD, Pope Gregory made two reforms in AD
 pratham sudhaar yah tha ki shatabdiyon ke dinon kii vyavastha naveen rup se kii gai, jo aajkal prachlit he
 The system was that the century which can be divided from 400 to the remaining is the leap year; All other centuries are normal years
 yah niyam jyotish ke aadhunik yantron se paane gaye sookshm sayan varshmaan ke anusaar kiya gaya he
 By neglecting this rule, 10 days were extended from the beginning of the year AD to 1582 AD
 is nayi vyavastha ko naveen paddati or purv kii paddati ko pracheen paddati kehete hai
 In chronology, the events up to October 4, 1582 AD are expressed in the ancient way and the events after that in the new method

 parishisht main yah bataaya gaya he ki is sanwat kaa varsharambh i

 Accordingly, the 1932 year of this Vikram Samvat would have started in August, ie, Chaitra month in 1857
 isse adhik is parishisht se ham nahin jaan sakate
 To know with certainty the month and month of AD, we should also get acquainted with the mathematics of the month and day of Vikram Samvat, which is mentioned in the article titled "pachang and Panchagapaddhati"

 Aryashtangam Marg is one of the major teachings of Mahatma Buddha, which has been described as a means of attaining freedom from suffering and self-knowledge
 ashtaang maarg ke sabhi 'maarg', 'samyak' shabd se armbh hote hai 
 In Buddhist symbols, ashtanga passages are often represented by the eight todos of the Dharmachakra
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is - the way to get rid of sorrow
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : Some people consider the Arya Ashtanga Marg as a path, in which to move forward, it is necessary to attain the level of the previous
 or logon ko lagata he ki is maarg ke str sab saath-saath paae jate he
 The route is classified into three parts: Pragya, Sheel and Samadhi
 bhagavan buddha ne bataaya ki trishna hi sabhi du:khon kaa mul kaaran he
 Due to craving, man tends towards different things in the world; And when he cannot get them or when they are destroyed even after receiving, then he feels sad
 trishna ke saath mrityu praapt karanevaala praani uski prerana se phir bhi janm grahan karata he or sansar ke du:khachakr main pisataa rahata he
 Therefore, the way to satisfy Trishna completely is the path to salvation
 ise du:kha-nirodh-gamini pratipada kehete hai
 Lord Buddha has given eight parts of this path: is maarg ke pratham do ang pragna ke or antim do samadhi ke hai
 The middle four are of modesty
 is tarah sheel, samadhi or pragna inhen teen main aathon angon kaa sannivesh ho jaataa he
 Only when modesty is pure can one enter into spiritual life
 shuddh sheel ke aadhaar par mumukshu dhyanabhyas kar samadhi kaa laabh karata he or samadhisth avasthaa main hi use satya kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is called Pragya, as soon as it becomes enlightened, the seeker is interviewed with the impermanent, anonymous and sad nature of mere power
 pragna ke alok main iskaa agyanandhkaar nasht ho jaataa he
 This leaves all the desires of the world
 vitatrishna ho vah kahin bhi ahankaar mamkaar nahin karata or sukh du:kha ke bandhan se upar uth jaataa he
 Due to the absence of craving for the difference of this life, there is no one to take birth again
 is prakaar, sheel-samadhi-pragnawala maarg aath angon main vibhakt ho arya aashtangik maarg kaha jaataa he

 " == Aishwarya's movies == hum dil de chuke sanam suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda dharmaveer bharti kaa prasiddh upanyaas he
 In this miniature novel by Dharmavir Bharati, a novel has been composed in the form of stories told in 7 twopods in the style of Hitopadesh and Panchatantra
 yah pustak ke rup main bhartiya gyanpith se It has been called a short novel
 kathanak kii bunaavat upanyaas kii vishay–vastu ko nae aayam pradaan karti he
 The 'seventh horse of the sun' is also believed to be influenced by the ancient styles of indo-iran
 lekin, puraani kissagoi kaa yah tarika –alifalaila, panchatantr, dashakumarcharit athwa kathasaritsagar – ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ kii upree twachaa maatr he, ise kathanak kaa buniyadi dhaanchaa nahin mana ja saktaa
 a second style can also be reflected in this - that is, a genre like the Veeraagathaas or other epics, in which the creator is not only the author of his works, but also himself is present in the midst of events
 vah bhokta or rachayita donon he
 In this way, creation becomes an obligation to be neutral, to transform private cognition into public experience
 ‘prithviraj raso’ ke rachayita chandvardaayi iske mahatvapoorn charitra bhi hai, thik usee tarah jaise valmiki or tulsi khud ko apni rachanaaon main upasthit kar dete hai yaa ki sanjay mahabharat ke ghatnachakra main maujuud he
 Manik Mulla narrates the tales of 'suraj Ka Seventh Horse', but he is not only the speaker of these stories - he is present with great vigor among them
 ve in kahaniyon ke bhokta bhi hai, thik valmiki, sanjay or chand kii tarah
 It is said that Chandavardayi did not complete the 'raso' and handed it over to his son Jalahan
 ‘raso’ ke antim ansh usee ke dwaara likhe gaye, thik isi prakaar ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ kii kahaniyaan hai to sunai hui maanik mullah kii, parantu unhen prastut karata he unka ek shrota ’main’
 'I' is its original author but he, like Tulsi of Ramcharit Manas, who becomes merely the presenter of ram-katha's shiva-parvati dialogue - comes before us
 vah maanik dwaara sunai kahaniyon ke bare main kahata he ki “ant main main yah bhi spasht kar dena chahta hoon ki is laghu upanyaas kii vishay-vastu main jo kuch bhalaai-buraai ho uskaa jimmaa mujh par nahin maanik mullah par hi he
 i have just put that story in front of you in my own way ''
 yah lekhak–prastota bhi katha main bhale hi ek maamuli haisiyat se-ek shrota ke rup main- maujuud he
 Creations and creators have been a smooth movement in the Indian tradition
 yah upanyaas bhi apane kathanak kii bunaavat main katha or kathakaar kii tadrupata ko sambhav hone detaa he
 Real and imagination begin to complement each other
 yadi kaha jaay ki madhyavarg aadha yatharth or aadha swapn main jeene vaala varg he to galat na hoga
 For creation, the combination of imagination and reality is an essential condition
 isliye madhyavarg sarvaadhik srujansheel, swapnjivi or badlavamulak hota he 
 The 'seventh horse of the sun' presents the story of this middle class - with its contradictory positions - to us
 is rachana ke kathanak ko nae kalevar main buna gaya he
 It started with a nuisance
 upodghaat yani prastaavna, bhoomika
 Four Anadhyas have also been added in between the main story-chapters
 inke atirikt puri katha saat dopaharon main vibhakt he
 The story of the seven afternoons is from Manik Mulla and the four Anadhyayas including Upodhgadha are the comments of his listener 'I'
 kul milakar baarah bhaagon main vibhajit yah katha maanik mullah ke jivan samet unke sampark main aae pramukh charitron- jamuna, lily or satti kii jindagi par prakaash daalati he
 Also, it shows how Manik Mulla's audience reacted to the references associated with these characters
 apni inhen mili-juli ghatnaon ko lekar yah upanyaas aakaar grahan karata he
 In the nuptials, we get to know about Manik Mulla's personality, his interests, his ability to create stories and his style of narration
 yaheen hamen yah bhi pataa chalata he ki, ‘’agar kaaphi fursat ho, puraa ghar adhikaar main ho, chaar mitra baithe hon, to nishchit he ki gum-phirakar vaarta raajnneeti par aa tikegi or jab raajnneeti main dilchaspee khatm hone lagegi to goshtee kii vaarta ‘prem’ par aa tikegi
 But as far as literary dialogue was concerned, he preferred love
 in kathanon se pataa chalata he ki upanyaas lekhan ke liye jaruri upkaran koun se hai
 They are - leisure time, people who are on their own leisure and are looking for stories to cut it, in a place where there is no external disturbance
 raajnneeti, prem or sahitya upanyaas ke sahaj-swaabhaavik vishay ho sakate hai
 The seventh horse of the sun is created using these tools
 isaliye yah kriti viraat saamaajik prashnon ko nazarandaaj kar vaiyaktik sandarbhon se rachi jaati he
 It has been kept in the category of short novel rather than in the category of epic novel
 adarsh kii sthapana ke bajaay yatharth kaa udghaatan hi iske kendra main he
 This reality also evokes miniatures in its senses and emotions, more than everyday common events
 maanik mullah samet sabhi charitra ek ausat charitra hai, ve apni dainik ghatnaon se hi itane abhibhoot hai ki desh-duniya or samaaj ko apni nijee nigahon se jaanchne-parakhane kaa kaam karte he
 That is why they have a reduced understanding of big social philosophy
 girija kumaar maathur ne ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ ke rachana-vidhaan ko teen katha-vritton main vibhajit kiya he
 The center of the first story is Manik Mulla
 jamuna, lily or tanna centre ke upgrah
 The center of the second story is also Manik Mulla, satellites of Sati, Mahesar and Chaman Singh Center
 teesraa katha-vrutt ‘main’ kaa he, jiske ek ore marxvaadi siddhanton kaa vyangypurna chithran he or duusari ore vyaktivaadee kala-paksh
 This circle is secondary
 girija kumaar maathur ne aage isaki shilpagat visheshtaon kaa ullekh karte hue tippanee kii he ki, “anadhyaay main ‘main’ ne sabake charitra kaa vishleshan kisi na kisi rup main kiya he, kintu maanik mullah se uskaa itnaa moh he ki kahin bhi unka santulit vishleshan usne nahin hone diya he
 That is, the listener named 'I' who created the story, claims within the novel that i am presenting Manik Katha as it is, and for everything else, including technics, he is responsible to Manik Mulla
 Is, but he could not remain neutral
 is upanyaas kii sanrachana main jaise maanik ke bare main prakaash kaa mat tha ki, “ho na ho maanik mullah main bhi hindi ke anya kahanikaron kii tarah nari ke prati kuch obseshan he
 "some such obsession is about the ruby of 'I'
" vah maanik ke vishisht vyaktiv se abhibhoot he or sankalpabaddh hokar unki kahaniyon ko bachaane kaa udhyam karata he 
 This unique listener 'I' definitely considered these stories to be important, that's why Manik Mulla has been committed towards saving them
