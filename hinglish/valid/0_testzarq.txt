 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth

 Since more than 99% of invasive cervical cancers occur in HPV worldwide, some researchers have suggested that HPV testing be done alongside regular cervical testing
 However, with the prevalence of HPV, others suggest that regular HPV testing will arouse undue fear in carriers

 beesvin sadi ke armbh main manushya or uske paryaavaran ke bich sambandhon par adhyayan prarambh hua or ek saath kai vishyon main is ore dhyaan diya gaya
 The result was the compilation of human ecology

 For example mankind builds on the earth and also affects vegetation

 Those plants continue to spread

 From a living cell to organ, organism, population, community, ecosystem, biome and biosphere, interactions between organisms and their environment have different forms and evolution
 atah paristhitikeey adhyayan ke staron main pramukh hai: Like other ancient religions, Vedic philosophy has also believed that nature is vibrated with life
 sampoorn charachar jagat arthath prithvi, akaash, swarg, aag, vaayu, jal, vanaspati or jeev-jantu sab main daivatv kii dhara pravaahit he
 Knowledge of this approach comes from the fact that when Shakuntala of Kalidas, who grew up in an ashram in the lap of nature, started going to the city to meet her husband Dushyant, the trees and flowers, the deer fed by her, were very sad
 Happened

 The Bateshwar Hindu Temple is a temple of about 200 sandstone Hindu temples in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh, these temple groups are the early gurjara-pratihara style temple groups of North Indian temple architecture

 The site is within the fort of the Chambal river valley, on the northwest slope of a hill near the pedestal known for its prominent medieval era Vishnu temple

 According to Michael Meister, an art historian and a professor specializing in Indian temple architecture, the earliest temples of the Batsarava group near Gwalior are likely to be around 750–800 AD
 13 veen shatabdi ke baad ye mandir nasht ho gaye; yah spasht nahin he ki yah bukamp yaa muslim balon dwaara kiya gaya tha
 The site was visited by Alexander Cunningham in 1882 and its ruins were mentioned with the latter being "a very old temple" as "a collection of 100 temples large and small to the south-east of Parvali"

 During the colonial British era limited recovery, standardized temple numbers, ruin segregation with photography, and site preservation efforts were initiated

 Muhammad has continued the campaign for further restoration of the site and calls it "the place of my pilgrimage

 " According to Muhammad, the Bateshwar complex was built on the basis of "sanskrit Hindu temple architecture texts, Mansara Shilpa Shastra, architectural principles composed in the fourth century and Mayamat Vastu Shastra written in the 7th century CE"

 pichley 20 varshon main, puure vishwa main 15 million logon ko kushtarog se mukt kiya ja chukaa he
 However, forceful quarantine or segregation of patients is unnecessary in places where adequate treatments are available, but still there is still leprosy in countries like India, China, Romania, Egypt, Nepal, Somalia, Liberia, Vietnam and Japan all over the world

 It is now believed that there may have been many cases of syphilis from early cases of leprosy
 It is now known that leprosy is neither transmitted through sexual contact nor is highly contagious after treatment because about 95% of people are naturally immunized and people suffering from it also after only 2 weeks of treatment They do not remain contagious

 It is estimated that only 5% of people are at risk of leprosy due to genetic factors

 maut kii traasadee se apni sukhad agyanta ke saath vah kahata he, "maranaa ek bahut hi bada romaanchakaari anubhav hoga
" In some variations of the story and some additional forms, Peter can also be somewhat dirty and selfish
 kahani ke digni roopantaran main, peter bahut hi aalochanatmak or aadambarpurn dikhaai padataa he 
 In the 2003 live-action film, Peter Pan is sensitive about the subject of "growing up"
 " jab hook dwaara wendi ke bade hone, shaadi karne or aakhirkaar peter ke liye apni "khidki band kar dene" kii baat saamne aati he, to vah vahut udhaas ho jaataa he or antat ladane kii chaah chhod detaa he
 Peter's structural ability is his never ending youth
 "peter or vendi" main yah bataaya gaya he ki peter ko apane hi romaanchak ghatnaon or vah duniya ke bare main kya sikhta he taaki bachche kii tarah rahaa jaae, in baton ko bhul janaa chahie
 lekhak kevin orlin johnson kaa tark he ki pan kii kahaniyaan totenkinderjeschichate kii german-angreji parampara main hai, or yah vichaar ki peter or sabhi lost bvoize mar chuke hai or nevarland main marane ke baad kii jindagi ji rahe hai jo bairi kii apni jindagi kii kahani main nihit hai usee yug se sambandhit hai
 The fact that other Lost Boys are growing up and may be killed offends Peter and Wendy

 Peter's ability to fly is explained to some extent, but not with consistency
 In Da Little White Bird he is able to fly because he - like all children - is half a bird
 naatak or upanyaas main, vah "sundar adbhut vichaaron" or pariyon vaali dhul ke sanyog se priy bacchon ko udana sikhaata he; yah spasht nahin he ki vah "khushnuma vichaaron" kii aavashyaktaa ke prati gambhir he ; yaa use swayan ke liye pariyon vaali dhul kii aavashyaktaa he
 In Hooke, the adult Peter is not able to fly until he remembers the "happy thoughts"
 In the earlier stories of Starcatchers, a star-like thing - apparently the same thing as fairy dust - has also been attributed to its ability to fly
 peter jab nevar land main hota he to vahaan ke nivaasiyon ke saath-saath har jagah uskaa prabhaav rahata he
 Barry says that although Never Land seems different for every child, or when he returns from his trip to London, the island "wakes up"
 In The Mermaid Lagoon chapter of the book Peter and Wendy, Barry writes that there is almost nothing that Peter cannot do
 He is a skilled swordsman, who confronts even Captain Captain Hook, or cuts off his hand in a duel
 uske paas ek gajab kii duuradrushti or sunne kii kshamta he
 He is able to imitate, mimic Hooke's voice, and make a tick-like sound of gongs
 peter pan and wendi or peter pan in skarlet donon main, peter kii kaalpanik chizon, jaise ki bhojan ko vaastaviktaa main laane kii kshamta kaa kai jagah ullekh he, haalanki yah kshamta peter pan in skarlet main kahin adhik kendriya bhoomika adaa karata he
 He also makes imaginary windows and doors as a physical figure to cut off or ignore his companions
 uske bare main kaha gaya he ki jab uske aas-paas koi khatra hota he to vah ise mahasoos kar saktaa he
 In Peter Pan in Scarlet it is said that when Curley's puppy licks Peter, his tongue is covered with a lot of fairy dust, implying that he too has become fairy-like, One who can prepare his own dust, but it also has a simple meaning that he spends so much time among the fairies that he has fallen into their dust
 peter or wendi main, bairi kehete hai ki peter pan kii dantakatha misses darling ek bachche ke rup main suuni jaati he jab bachche mar jate hai, unhone ise unke lakshya tak pahunchaane ke ek hisse ke rup main ise joda he jisase ki ve bhaybheet naa hon, isiliye ve unani devtaa harmes ko ek psycopomp ke rup main unki bhoomika ke liye milaate hai
 Peter does not know his parents
 kencington gardens main bairi ne likhaa he ki usne unhen ek shishu ke rup main hi chhod diya tha or jab vah lautakar aayaa to ghar main ek nae shishu ko dekha or uske liye daravaaje band ho gaye the, usne yah maan liya ve ab use nahin chaahate the
 She is described as an orphan in Starcatchers, though her friends Molly and George find out who her parents are and are present in Rundun
 hook main, peter apane mata pita ko yaad karata hai, vishesh rup se apni maan ko, jo use badhate hue dekhnaa chaahati thi or use landan ke sarvshereshth skool main padhaakar uske pita kii tarah ek nyaayadhish bananaa or uskaa apana ek parivaar bana chaahati thi
 After Peter "flees" to Neverland, when he returns, he learns that his parents have forgotten him and that they have a second child
 lost bvoize, bacchon kaa ek samooh jinhen unke mata-pita ne kho diya gaya he or jo nevar land main rahane aaye hai, peter unka leader he; yah bataaya gaya he ki jab ve bade hone lagate hai to vah unhen "kamjor kar detaa" he
 She is Tinker Bell's best friend, a common fairy and often jealous of her safety
 capten hook uskaa pratishodhi dushman he, jiske saath dwandvayuddh main vah uske haath kaat detaa he
 Hooke's crew consists of Smee and Starkey, and they also consider him an enemy
 starcachars kii pustakon main uske atirikt dushman hai: slank, lord ombra or captain neresza
 From time to time, Peter goes around the real world, especially the Kensington Gardens and befriends the children there
 wendi darling, jise vah apni "maan" ke rup main chunata he, uske liye sabase adhik mahatvapurn he; vah unke anurodh par apane bhaaiyon jon or maaikel ko nevar land lekar aata he
 He later becomes a friend of Wendy's daughter Jane and Peter and Wendy say that he will continue to do the same things indefinitely
 At Starcatchers, he already befriends Molly Astor and the young George Darling
 aisa maaloom hota he ki nevar land ke sabhi nivasee peter ko jaanate hai, jinamein bhartiya rajkumaari tiger lily or uskaa samutay, matsay kanyaayein or pariyaan shaamil hai
 In Hook, Peter tells of his desire to grow up that he wanted to be a father
 usne wendi kii potee, moira ke saath shaadi kii he or unke do bachche hai, megi or jaik
 Peter Pan's character has appeared in the form of countless tributes and songs and has since been the subject of many fictional compositions

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sarasanghachaalkon kii suchi: It is often said that the Sangh is a developing organization
 keval shakha yaa vividh kaary hi nahin, to anek paramparaayen bhi swayan viksit hoti chalati hai
 Being a family organization, one does not have to see the constitution for everything here
 baahar se dekhne vaale ko shaayad yah ajeeb lagata ho; par jo log sangh or uski karypranali ko lambe samay se dekh rahe hai, ve isaki vaastaviktaa se parichit hai
 This is normal for them
 yadi ham sarasanghachaalak parampara ko dekhen, to param poojaneey doctor headgavar ko unke sahyogiyon ne bina unki jaankaree ke sarasanghachaalak banaaya
 On this occasion, Dr
 Ji said that, following your orders, i am taking this responsibility; But as soon as someone worthy of me meets you, you give it to him
 main ek saamaanya swayamsevak kii tarah unke saath kaam karuunga
 When Dr
 ji's health deteriorated, he consulted his colleagues and told Mr
 Guru in front of everyone before his lumbar-puncture operation that after me you have to take up the work of the Sangh
 is prakaar sangh ko dwitiya sarasanghachaalak kii prapti hui
 When Shri Guruji felt that this body would not be able to support him for a long time, he too consulted his fellow workers and by a letter declared Shri Balasaheb Deoras as the new Sarsanghchalak
 vah patr unke dehanth ke baad kholaa gaya tha
 Balasaheb assumed this responsibility after the death of Shri Guruji, this created a belief in the minds of the people that this responsibility is lifelong and the former Sarsanghchalak can give this responsibility to anyone as per his wish
 sangh virdohi ise ek gupt sanghathan to kehete hi the; par ab unhone ise aloktantric bhi maan liya
 Shri Balasaheb Deoras removed the method adopted by both of his former sarsanghchalaks and appointed a new sarsanghchalak
 unhone swasthya bahut kharaab hone par akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha main sab pratinidhiyon ke sammukh shri rajju bhaiya ko nayaa sarasanghachaalak ghoshit kiya
 Mother Rajju Bhaiyya and then Shri Sudarshan Ji also followed this method
 is prakaar sangh main ek nayi parampara viksit hui
 Look at this development from another point of view
 jab balasahab ne daayitv se mukti lee, tab unka swasthya bahut kharaab tha
 He could walk on the wheel chair only
 munh main baar-baar thook bhar jaataa tha, at: bolne main bhi unako bahut kathinaayee hoti thi
 His written messages were heard in all programs
 apni dainik kriyaayein bhi ve kisi ke sahyog se hi kar pate the
 For this reason, everyone took their liberty freely
 duusari ore rajju bhaiya ne jab kaarybhaar choda, to ve purna swasth to nahin; par pravaas karne yogya the
 He also had difficulty speaking on stage in public; But they used to hold personal talks easily
 daayitv se mukt hokar bhi unhone anek praanton kaa pravaas kiya
 That is, if they wanted, they could fulfill this responsibility for two-three years
 But he left this job after finding a suitable person
 jahaan tak paanchave sarasanghachaalak shri sudarshan ji kii baat he, daayitv mukti tak ve kaaphi swasth the
 He had little difficulty speaking publicly as well as migration
 phir bhi jab unhen laga ki shri mohan bhagwat ke rup main ek suyogy evam urjavan kaaryakarta saamne he, to unhone bhi jimmedaari chhod di
 It is clear that he did what Adi Sarsanghchalak Dr
 Hedgewar said while accepting his office that whenever you get more qualified workers than me, you should make him Sarsanghchalak
 main unke nirdesh ke anusaar kaam karuunga
 This is the belief in one tradition and the development of another tradition
 puraani neenv par naye nirmaan kaa isse adhik sundar udhaaharan or kya hoga ? Think from another point of view
 poojya dow ji ke dehanth ke baad unka dah sanskaar reshim baag main hua
 Today his samadhi is built there, which is called 'smriti Mandir'

 There is a grand statue of Doctor Ji, which is open from three sides
 spasht he sangh main vyakti kaa mahatv hote hue bhi vyakti puja ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 The second Sarsanghchalak Shri Guruji wrote three letters before his death
 duusare patr main hi unhone kah diya tha ki doctor ji kii tarah unka koi smarak na banaaen
 The workers cremated him in front of Smriti Mandir, honoring his wish
 aaj vahaan yajna jwaalaon ke rup main ek chota ‘smriti chinh’ bana he
 On it are inscribed the lines of Sant Tukaram, to which Mr
 Guruji, in quoting his third letter, apologized to all the volunteers
 shri balasahab devaras isse ek kadam or aage gayi
 He had already told the workers that we should not make Reshim Bagh the cremation ground of Sarsanghchalakas
 isliye meraa antim sanskaar saamaanya shmashaan ghat par kiya jaae
 Balasaheb died in Pune; But he spent a lot of his life in Nagpur
 unke anek mitra va sambandhi vahaan the, jo unke antim darshan kar shradhanjali dena chaahate the
 Hence, his body was brought to Nagpur and dedicated to Agni at Gangabai Ghat
 balasahab ke hi samaan rajju bhaiya kaa dehanth bhi pune main hua
 He once expressed a wish that there is no need to bring his dead body to Nagpur or Delhi
 jahaan unka dehanth ho, vahiin unka antim sanskaar kar diya jaae
 For this reason, he was cremated in Pune
 sudarshan ji kaa dehanth raipur main hua
 His body was brought to Nagpur
 sangh ke kuch kaaryakarta unke parthiv sharir ko ek rath se antim sanskaar ke liye reshmibagh se ganga bai ghat le gaye
 At some point the Sangh was accused of being Maratha and Brahminical; But after Prof
 Rajendra Singh of Uttar Pradesh and Sudarshan Ji of Karnataka became sarsanghchalak, these people got their faces stitched
 2009 main mohan bhagwat ke sarasanghachaalak or suresh joshi ke sarkarywah banane ke baad ye vitandavadi phir chillaaye; par ab kisi ne unhen ghaas nahin daali
 Everyone has understood that such allegations are nothing but nonsense
 jo log sangh ko lakeer kaa fakir yaa puraani paramparaon se chipta rahane vaala kupamandu sanghathan kehete hai, unhen sarasanghachaalak parampara ke vikaas kaa adhyayan karnaa chahie
 The Sangh has not yet celebrated its centenary; But even after this, many changes have taken place in this tradition
 yah sangh kii jeevantta kaa pratik he or isi main sangh kii urja kaa rahasy chipa he

 Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' was born on the Magh Shukla 11, Samvat 1955, 21 February 1899 accordingly, in the Mahishadal princely state of Bengal
 vasant panchami par unka janmdin manaane kii parampara 1930 main prarambh hui
 He was born on Tuesday

 His father Pandit Ramshay Tiwari was a resident of Unnao and worked as a soldier in Mahishadal
 ve mul rup se uttar pradesh ke unnav jile ke gadhacola naamak gaanv ke nivasee the
 Nirala was educated up to high school
 baad main hindi sanskrit or bangla kaa swatantra adhyayan kiya
 In the beginning, Nirala got acquainted with the inconveniences and humiliation of his father's small job
 unhone dalit-shoshit kisaan ke saath hamadardi kaa sanskaar apane abodh man se hi arjeet kiya
 The mother died at the age of three and by the age of twenty, the father died

 All his life after this was spent in financial struggle
 niraala ke jivan kii sabase vishesh baat yah he ki kathin se kathin paristhitiyon main bhi unhone siddhant tyagkar samjhaute kaa rasta nahin apanaaya, sangharsh kaa saahas nahin ganvaaya
 The latter part of life was spent in Allahabad
 vahiin daraganj muhalle main sthit raysahab kii vishaal kothi ke thik peeche bane ek kamare main 15 oktober 1961 ko unhone apni igalila samaapt kii
 The first appointment of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' took place in the Mahishadal state itself
 unhone 1918 se 1922 tak yah naukari kii
 He then moved to editing, independent writing and translation work
 1922 se 1923 ke dauraan kolkata se prakashit 'samanvay' kaa sampadan kiya, 1923 ke agast se matvaala ke sampadak mandal main kaary kiya
 He was then appointed to the Ganga Book Mala office in Lucknow, where he remained associated with the institution's monthly magazine Sudha till mid-1935
 1935 se 1940 tak kaa kuch samay unhone lakhanu main bhi bitaayaa
 After this, he lived in Allahabad till 1942 and did independent writing and translation work
 unki pehali kavita janmabhumi prabhaa naamak masik patr main june 1920 main, pehla kavita sangrah 1923 main anamika naam se, tathaa pehla niabandh bang bhashaa kaa uccharan oktober 1920 main masik patrika saraswati main prakashit hua
 Unlike other poets of his contemporary, he has taken little recourse to imagination in poetry and has portrayed reality prominently
 ve hindi main muktchand ke pravartak bhi maane jate hai
 In the role of his poetry collection Parimal published in 1930, he writes - niraala ne 1920 i0 ke aasapaas se lekhan kaary aarambh kiya
 His first composition was a song written on 'janmabhoomi'
 lambey samay tak niraala kii pratham rachana ke rup main prasiddh 'juhi kii kali' sheershak kavita, jiskaa rachanakaal niraala ne swayan 1916 i0 batalaaya tha, vastutah 1921 i0 ke aasapaas likhi gayi thi tathaa 1922 i0 main pehali baar prakashit hui thi
 Apart from poetry, Nirala has written in a tremendous amount in other genres of narrative and prose
 niraala rachanawali naam se 8 khandon main purv prakashit evam aprakashit sampoorn rachanaaon kaa suniyojit prakaashan The greatest feature of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' poetry is the skill of illustration
 aantarik bhav ho yaa bahya jagat ke drishy-rup, sangitatmak dhvaniyaan ho yaa rang or gandh, sajiv charitra hon yaa prakritik drishy, sabhi alag-alag laganevaale tattvon ko ghulaa-milakar niraala aisa jeevant chitra upasthit karte hai ki padhane vaala un chitron ke madhyam se hi niraala ke marm tak pahunch saktaa he
 Nirala's paintings not only contain her emotion, but also her thinking
 isliye unki bahut-si kavitaaon main darshanik gaharaai utpann ho jaati he
 Due to this new illustration skill and philosophical depth, often Nirala's poems become somewhat complicated, which the thinkers accuse them of rigor etc
 as they do not understand
 unke kisaan-bodh ne hi unhen chhayavaad kii bhoomi se aage badhkar yatharthwaad kii nai bhoomi nirmit karne kii prerana di
 Seeing special situations, characters and scenes, recognizing their heart and making those specific objects the subject of illustration is a notable feature of Nirala's realism
 niraala par aadhyatmavaad or rahasyavaad jaisi jivan-vimukh pravritiyon kaa bhi asar he
 Due to this effect, they often dream of conquering miracles and ending conflicts
 niraala kii shakti yah he ki ve chamatkaar ke bharose akarmanya nahin baith jate or sangharsh kii vaastavik chunauti se ankhen nahin churaate
 In some cases, mysticism goes against the unique real life experiences
 har ore prakaash failaa he, jivan alokamay mahaasaagar main dub gaya he, ityadi aisi hi baaten hai
 But this mysticism is not permanent in the sense of the infrequent, it proves to be fleeting
 anek baar niraala shabdon, dhvaniyon aadi ko lekar khilwaad karte hai
 It is difficult to call these players art
 lekin saamanyat: ve in khilvaadon ke madhyam se bade chamatkaarpurn kalatmak prayog karte hai
 The specialty of these experiments is that they are helpful in expressing the subject or emotion more effectively
 niraala ke prayogon main ek vishesh prakaar ke saahas or sajagata ke darshan hote hai
 It is this courage and awareness that makes Nirala different and special among poets of his era
 prakashmiti main main, prakaash strot se disha vishesh main, ikai thos kone main, nikalne vaali tarang-dairghy-bhaarit shakti ko deept tivrata kehete hai

 Initially man believed that the earth is a circular or a circular circle consisting of oceans, rivers and mountains, but when the tribes of the Babylonian priests of astronomy noticed that the arrangement of stars in the sky changes when going south and New stars appear and as the number of northern sodden stars decreases, they realize that perhaps the earth is spherical and nothing else Not his page must circumlocutory
 samudravasiyon ne jahaaj ko dur jane ke saath saath use neeche jate bhi dekha, to unhen bhi goleey nahin to pindaakaar prithvi kii kalpana kerani padi hogi, kintu is sabakaa koi pramaan nahin he
 The Earth is spherical, the first enforcement of this opinion being that of Pythagoras or his visitors; But his views were materialistic rather than indefinite on material facts
 arestu ke samay main unaniyon dwaara prithvi ko golakaar mana jane laga tha
 He gave an estimate of the Earth's circumference of 4,00,000 stadiums and said that the Earth is not much bigger than other celestial bodies
 aileggadriya kaa eretosthanij pehla lekhak he, jisane bhuparidhi nirdhaaran kii vidhi bataai
 On the Nile River, the modern Eswon, then popularly known as 'seine', considered it to be located on the Tropic of Cancer and considered the sun to be right there on the north solstice
 vahaan se 5,000 stadium dur aileggendria main, jo usee deshaantar par sthit mana gaya tha, surya shirobindu se bhuparidhi kaa 1 / 50 vaan bhaag dur dekhne main aayaa
 Thus the perimeter of the earth became 2,50,000 stadiums
 tolimi ne apni 'jiography' naamak pustak main bhuparidhi anumaan 1,80,000 stadium diya
 The definition of the stadium may have been different

 Then in Holland, Snail took shelter of the triangulation series instead of measurement
 1696 i0 main peepard ne akshansh nirdhaaran or bhu-tribhujan ke konon ko naapane main doordarshak kaa prayog kiya
 Based on the length he gave a fraction arc, Newton proved by calculation that geomagnetism was the dominant force in moving the Moon in its orbit
 newton or uske samakaleen hygange se bhuganit kaa nayaa yug aarambh hua
 Mainly due to mechanical enlightenment by them and as the Earth's rotation of its axis turned out to be true, the imagination prevailed that the Earth is not spherical but a short axis spheroid, which is flattened at the poles
 is dharna kii pushti khagolgy rishar ke is praayogit pramaan se ho gai ki uski ghadi jo paris main thik chalati thi dakshin america ke samin nagar main dhai minute prati ghanta sust ho jaati thi
 In opposition to this notion, Cassinus of France said that if the Earth is spherical, the distance from the equator to the pole should increase by a fraction of latitude
 kadachit iske vipareet bhi samajha jaay, kyonki pathak ke vichaar se bhukendriya akshansh ek anshvala chaap vah hoga jo bhucendre par ek ansh kaa kone antarit karata he, kintu iske anusaar samaksh prekshan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Observation of astronomical latitudes, which is the angle between the plumb line and equatorial plane, is possible
 dhruvon se jane vaala koi bhi samtal prithvi se dirghavritakar jaisaa pariched kaatega, jisaki vakrata dhruvon par sabase kam or vishuvat par sabase adhik hoti he falat: akshansh ke prati chaap vruddhi sabase adhik dhruvon par hogi
 But the opposite came to light, which made it seem that the Earth is a galaxy
 is prakaar prithvi ko laghvaksh or dderghaaksh samajhane vaale vidwaanon main vivaad chal padaa
 To determine this, the Paris Science Council sent two search teams, one to Peru and the other to Laplénde, whose latitudes were as large as possible
 1743 i0 main in dalo ne jo ek ansh chaap kii maapen deen, unes yah nishkarsh niklaa ki dhruvon par chapataapan 1 / 213 he, jab ki aadhunik maan 1 / 297 he
 This was followed by several measurements of the flatness and arc of the earth to determine the length of the meter
 yantron main sudhaar ke saath-saath pariklan vidhiyon main bhi sudhaar hue, jinamein gouse kaa nunatam varg siddhant atyant mahatvapurn he
 This method was widely used by the German astronomer Basel

 Now the automatic micrometer is installed in this instrument and it is used with time recorder
 ankshash nirdhaaran ke liye shirobindu doorabeen yaa bhang doordarshak yaamyantar yantra kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Such theodolites are used for the determination of azimuth and for measuring the angles of the angles, which are more subtle and accurate than those used in the general survey
 or adhik yatharthata kii prapti ke liye kitni hi maapen, yantra ke kshaitij vrutt par samaanath: vitarit vinduon se nirdisht pind par, disht kar lee jaati he
 Thus calibration errors can be avoided
 tribhujan main bhujaayen teen-chaar kilometre kii rahen to acha he
 If it is less then the number of measurement errors increases
 pahari sthal par 300 kilometre tak kii duuri par bhi spasht-drishyata rahati he
 In principle any distance can be determined only by measuring the base measured on one side and the angles at its ends
 is prakaar uttarotar keval konon ke maapan se hi koi bhi duuri gyaat kii ja sakati he, kintu vyavhaar main is prakaar pariklit kisi kisi duuri ko samaksh bhi maap liya jaataa he, jisase kone maapan kii yatharthata kii jaanch hoti rahati he
 Nowadays, distance is measured in front of a wire or lace made of alloy and nickel alloy of tin and tin

 The tension of the wire is also kept standard at the time of measurement
 is prakaar duuri maapan main 10 lakh main 1 tak kii parishuddhta ho jaati he
 In ground survey, land refers to the mean sea level on the sea and the surface designed on the site which is determined by the spirit plane
 yadi samudr se sthal main koi nahar khod di jaay, to jo tal nahar ke pani kaa hoga vahi prithvi tal mana jayega
 There is no mathematical precision in this physical definition because the sea level is also variable due to wind, alkalinity, pressure, heat etc
 prithvital kii ganitiya paribhaasha us samavibhav athwa samaan talawaale, prishth se di jaati he jisapar, prithvi main jitna bhi dravya hai tathaa jahaan bhi hai us sabake gurutvkarshan or aksh ke parit: ghurnan ke kaaran, vibhavafalan achar hota he
 These equipotential surface views will be perpendicular to the direction of gravity, ie, the combined effect of gravity and the rotating centrifugal force, and how many will be in number, the mean of which is closest to the ocean plane is considered to be the earth plane and is called the geosynchronous, or geoid
 Huh
 is shabd main prithvi ke golabh hone kaa bhav antarnihit nahin he
 The only feeling in it is that the Earth is of "earth shape"
 spirittal se binduon kaa jo unnayan miltaa he, vah jeeyoid ke saapeksh hota he, na ki parthiv golabh ke
 For a map, a geoid is considered to be a sphere that is closest to the Earth or any part of it that concerns us
 chunking prithvin purnat: golakaar nahin he, iske vibhinn yamyottareey chaapon ko or unke siron ke akshanshon ko maap kar, in sab prakshanon kaa nunatam varg siddhant, yaa anya kisi aisi vidhi se samanvay kar, prithvi kaa aakaar gyaat kiya jaataa rahaa he is kaary ke liye deshaantareey chaap bhi kaam main aa sakate hai, lekin inkaa maapan vidyut tarasanchaar kaa avishkaar hone par hi santoshjanak yatharthata kaa ho sakaa he or bhu-aakaar kaa nirdhaaran chaap ke bajaay kshetrafal arthath vikshep vidhi se kiya jane laga he
 In this new method, a large area corresponding to the triangulation series is taken, between which a point is chosen by choosing the radius of its longitude, azimuth and the azimuth of a line leading from it and two measurements associated with the geomorphism
 in geodi maanon ke aadhaar par tribhujan shrikhala dwaara parthiv golabh kaa pariklan liya jaataa he
 The irregular deflections of Sahulasutra have always been a puzzle for geologists
 ye khageleey yaa geodic nirdhaaran kii trutiyon se kahin adhik hote hai or apekshtya chote se kshetra ke liye bhi geodic nyaas main samuchit parivartan unhen vishesh se kam nahin kar saktaa
 Therefore, wherever the excess of deflection - mountain basins, plateaus, oceans, etc
 - was initially thought to be caused by visual topographic reasons, the area was left out of the calculation
 baad main jab adhik yatharth sthalakriti tathy uplabdh hue to un sabake prabhaav ke yantric vidhi se pariklan kii baat suujhi
 First the Archdeacon Pratt of Calcutta performed such calculations, although they were extremely laborious
 unhone dekha ki parakalit vikshep prakshepit vikshep se kahin kam tha
 The most satisfactory explanation of this fact was made on the assumption that the mass density below the parts above the earth is less than the average and below the trough is above average
 ganitiya suvidha isamen he ki ghanatv parivartan itnaa maan liy jaay ki bhuprisht se neeche ek vishisht gaharaai par, jise pratikaari gaharaai kehete hai, ekai kshetrafal par jo dravyaman upar kii ore sthit he achar ho
 This hypothesis is called topological retribution and such a system is topological
 samasthiti vidhi ko pehali baar sanyukt rajya par kiye gaye prekshanon main haoard ne prayukt kiya or 1924 i0 main antarrashtriya geodetic or bhubhautikeey sangh ke geodesi anubhag ne puri prithvi ke aakaar ko vah maan liya jo hefrd ne praapt kiya tha
 Later Heise Cannon applied this method to the vertical deflection in Europe and often confirmed the results of Hefford
 chunki prithvi purnat: drudh padaarth kii bani nahin maani jaati or phir usamen aksh ke parit: ghurnan he at: gurutvkarshan or ghurnan janya apkentre bal ke kaaran dhruvon par uski akruti chapate golabh kii he
 As a result, the sight at the poles and equinox is the difference in the measurements and directions of gravity
 lolak dolanon dwaara is antar ko atyant parishuddht: naapakar, pariklan dwaara prithvi kii akruti nirdhaarit ho jaati he
 Together, the radius of the earth can also be found, but it is not so accurate
 ye gurutv prekshan anya pariklanon main bhi upyogi siddh hue hai
 The variance of the vertical in the post-meteorological zone depends on both the astronomical latitude and the geodetic latitude
 inamen geodic akshansh bhi bhu-ghurnan ke kaaran vicharanshil he
 Each body has a shape axis, in which the moment of inertia is the greatest
 yadi ghurnan is aksh ke parit: na ho to, to ghurnanaksh kaa dhruv akruti aksh ke dhruv ke parit: ek band vakr main ghumaa karegaa
 In a nearly spherical body like the Earth, the direction of the ring rot will remain unchanged in the recess

 Based on this, astronomers made observations for latitude variance
 kai vyaktiyon ke asafal prayaason ke baad dhruvagtijnya akshansh parivartan, deshaantar main lagbhag 1800 ke antar vaale, do nagaron berlin or honolulu main dekha gaya
 The increase in one was almost the same as the decrease in the other
 chandalar ne dekha ki akruti dhruv ke parit: ghurnan dhruv kaa parikraman lagbhag 14 maas main puraa ho jaataa he
 The duration of this period is due to the elastic matter of water and earth, while for the firm body, the duration should have been 10 months according to the rules of oil
 prithvi ke ghurnan dhruv kii gati kuch is kaaran bhi hoti he ki akruti-dhruv ritu, daab, megh aadi ke kaaran vicharanshil rahata he
 The period of these Arvat changes is one year
