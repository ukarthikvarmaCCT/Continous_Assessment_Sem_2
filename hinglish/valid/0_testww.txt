 beringia ek bada kshetra tha or iskaa adhiktar bhaag himanion se mukt tha or iske stapi jaise kshetra par bahut se jaanavar rahete the
 That's why even a few thousand humans could live here

 Some historians think that the Paleolithic culture of Belgian humans at one time spanned the whole of Berinjia from the Primordia region of Siberia in the east to Alaska in the west and Hokkaido in the south

 baad main jab yah falkar alaska or uttar america ke anya bhaagon main gaye to vahaan bhi unhone apni maharath se bade paimaane par in bade jaanwaron kaa shikaar jari rakhaa
 It is believed to be a major cause of the extinction of mammoths, mastodons and hairy rhinoceros in the North American continent

 "dalit" -: pitied, exploited, suppressed, disgusted, depressed, torn, fragmented, broken, crushed, stifled, crushed, mashed, trampled, destroyed "falit" - : pidamukt, ucch, prasann, khushhaal, akhand, akhandit, jodna, samanta, ecreup, purnroop, sampurna The word dalit literally means dalan

 Ramachandra Varma wrote in his dictionary the meaning of Dalit, mashed, mourned, pressed, trampled or crushed, destroyed
 pichley chah-saat dashakon main 'dalit' pad kaa arth kaaphi badal gaya he
 After Dr

 bharat main dalit andolan kii shuruuaat jyotirav govindrav phule ke netritv main hui

 iske baavjood jyotiba foole ne hameshaa hi tathakthith 'nichi' jati ke logon ke adhikaron kii pairvi kii
 In Indian society, Jyotiba's effort was to educate the Dalits
 jyotiba hi wo pehle shaks the jinhon daliton ke adhikaron ke saath-saath daliton kii shiksha kii bhi pairvi kii
 Along with this, Jyoti took tolerable steps for women's education
 bhartiya itihaas main jyotiba hi wo pehle shaks the jinhone daliton kii shiksha ke liye na keval vidhyalay kii vakaalat kii balki sabase pehle dalit vidhyalay kii bhi sthapana kii
 In Jyoti, Dalits were shown a path in Indian society, on which the Dalit society and other people later fought many battles for the rights of Dalits
 yun to jyotiba ne bharat main dalit andolanon kaa sutarapaat kiya tha lekin ise samaaj kii mukhyadhara se jodne kaa kaam babasaheb bhimrao ambedkar ne kiya
 Another thing that would be meaningless without mentioning the Dalit movement is Buddhism
 isa purv 600 isvi main hi buddha dharm ne hindu samaaj ke nichle tabakon ke adhikaron ke liye awaz uthaai
 Lord Gautam Buddha also initiated a social and political revolution through Buddhism
 ise raajnneetik kranti kahana isliye jaruri he kyonki us samay satta par dharm kaa aadhipaty tha or samaaj kii disha dharm ke dwaara hi tay kii jaati thi
 In such a situation, the direction of the revolution which Lord Buddha showed to the bottom table of the society is relevant even today
 bharat main charvak ke baad bhagwaan buddha hi pehle aise shaks the jinhone brahmanwad, jateevaad or andhvishwaas ke khilaaf na keval aawaaj uthaai balki ek darshan bhi diya
 So that the people of the society can be free from the chains of intellectual enslavement
 yadi samaaj ke nichle tabakon ke adolnon kaa adikaal se itihaas dekha jaae to charvak ko nakaarna bhi sambhav nahin hoga
 Although Charvac is accused of many types, Charvac was the first person who taught people to be free from the fear of God
 bhartiya darshan main charvak ne hi bina dharm or ishwar ke sukh kii kalpana kii
 Charvak is also seen raising the voice of Dalits on this pattern

 khayr baat ko lautaate hai us vakt jis vakt daliton ke adhikaron ko kanoonee jama pehanaane ke liye bharat ratna baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar ne ladaai shuru kar di thi
 

then when our country India came under the category of British colony
 logon ke ye daastaa kaa samay rahaa ho lekin daliton ke liye kai myanon main swarnakaal tha
 Today, the background of whatever rights the Dalits have got in India was due to this rule
 europe main hue purnajagaran or gyanoday andolanon ke baad maanviya mulyon kaa mahima mandan hua
 These human values became the ideals of the revolution of Europe
 in aadarshon kii jariye hi europe main ek aise samaaj kii rachana kii gai jisamen maanviya mulyon ko praathamikta di gai
 It is different then that due to industrialization, these values were first replaced by capital in Europe
 

lekin iske baavjood europe main hi sabase pehle maanviya adhikaron ko kanoonee manyata di gai
 Its direct impact was bound to fall on India and it had to do
 iskaa sidhaa sa asar ham bharat ke samvidhan main dekh sakate hai
 All the articles from the preamble to the Indian Constitution appear to protect these human rights
 bharat main daliton kii kanoonee ladaai ladane kaa jimmaa sabase shashakt rup main dow ambedkar ne uthaaya
 Dr
 Ambedkar is the pioneer of Dalit society
 baba sahab ambedkar ne sabase pehle desh main daliton ke liye saamaajik, raajnneetik or aarthik adhikaron kii pairvi kii
 Clearly spoke of opposing the immediate nature of Indian society and the rights of the most backward and despised people of the society
 raajnneetik or saamaajik har rup main iskaa virodh swaabhaavik tha
 Even Mahatma Gandhi jumped in opposition to these demands
 baba sahab ne maang kii daliton ko alag pratinidhitiv milanaa chahie yah dalit raajnneeti main aaj tak kii sabase shashakt or prabal maang thi
 The breath of the Congress, which had assumed the responsibility of independence of the country on its shoulder, had also stopped at this demand
 kaaran saaf tha samaaj ke taane bane main logon kaa sidhaa swaarth nihit tha or koi bhi is taane bane main jaraa sa bhi badlaav nahin karnaa chahta tha
 Mahatma Gandhi was made to stick against it and was put on fast unto death
 aamaran anshan vaise hi desh ke mahatma ke sabase prabal hathiyaar tha or wo is hathiyaar ko aaye din apni baton ko manaane ke liye prayog karte rahete the
 Baba Saheb did not want to back down from this demand at any cost
 He knew that a simple withdrawal from this demand meant agreeing against the most important demand raised for Dalits
 lekin un par chaaron ore se dabaav padane laga
 And finally in an agreement called Poona Pact, the demand for the rights of Dalits was abolished by calling for religion
 in sabake baavjood drumbedkar ne haar nahin maani or samaaj ke nichle tabakon ke logon kii ladaai jari rakhi
 The result of Ambedkar's efforts is that the rights of Dalits were given a place in the Indian Constitution
 yahaan tak ki samvidhan ke moulik adhikaron ke jariye bhi daliton ke adhikaron kii raksha karne kii koshish kii gai
 Although the presence of the Dalit class in literature has been prominent since the Buddhist period, Dalit literature as a targeted human rights movement is largely a product of the twentieth century
 rabindra prabhaat ne apane upanyaas taaki bachaa rahe loktantr main daliton kii saamaajik sthiti kii vrihad charchaa kii he vahiin douen
singh ne apnin pustak "dalit sahitya ke pratimaan " main hindi dalit sahitya ke itihaas kon bahut hi vistaar se likhaa he
 "thakur ka well" is a famous story of Prem Chandra, whose plot focuses on untouchability
 kahani kii mukhya paatr gangi apane biimaar pati ke liye kuen kaa saaf pani nahin laa paati he, kyonki ucch jati ke log daliton ko apane kuen se pani nahin laane dete hai
 Dalits are beginning to feel that the exit from Hinduism may be a better way for them as the condition of the newly born Buddhists has improved over the years, while the life of Hindu Dalits has not changed much despite being organized as a vote bank

 According to the 2001 census, Buddhists have a population of eight lakhs in the country, most of whom are converted from Hindu Buddhists to Hindu Dalits

 This is in accordance with the high status of women in Buddhist society

 According to the 2001 census, the sex ratio of girls and boys among Buddhists is 942, higher than the 938 for Hindu Dalits
 yah ling anupaat hinduon, sikh kii tulana main bahut adhik he, or jain 
 It is in comparison with Hindu Dalit families that the girls have received better care and protection among the Buddhists

 Insider transactions based on non-public information received by the public during the performance of the shares or other securities of the corporation or working persons in the related party company), or where the trustee as well as other contacts of trust and faith have been disrupted or where the company Non-public information received from has been used inappropriately

 Many investors follow the summaries of these insider transactions in the hope that the imitation of these trades will be beneficial for them

 The sec's clarification states that the United States' prohibition against insider trading does not demand any form of evidence as to whether an insider actually used non-public elements during the transaction; Mere possession of such information in its own right is considered sufficient to violate the provision and the SEC may indict any insider holding the elements of non-public information for use of these information at the time of conducting the business

 For example, if a insider of a company retires after a fixed period of time as part of the retirement plan and each month a written sale of a particular amount of shares of the company for the next two years
 , Adopts a binding scheme, and insiders receive non-public information about the company during this period, then based on the original hypothesis The transaction may not constitute prohibited insider trading

 Cyclonic separation is a method of removing particulates from the air, gas or liquid stream, through vortex separation without the use of filters

 The method can also be used to separate fine droplets of liquid from a gas stream

 Air flows in a spiral pattern, beginning at the top and bottom ends of the cyclone through the center of the cyclone and into a straight stream from above, before exiting the cyclone
 Larger particles in the rotating stream follow the tight curve of the stream much more and strike the outside wall inertia, then falling under the cyclone, where they can be removed
 In a conical system, as the flow moves toward the narrow end of the rotating cyclone, the rotational radius of the stream is reduced, thus separating smaller and smaller particles
 The cyclone geometry, together with the flow rate, defines the cut point of the cyclone

 Larger particles from the cut point will be removed with smaller particles with a greater efficiency and a lower efficiency

 Large scale cyclones are used in sawmills to remove sawdust from the extracted air
 The cyclone also separates oils and gases used in oil refineries and in the cement industry as components of kiln preheaters
 Cyclones are increasingly used at home as core technology in portable vacuum cleaners and bagless types of central vacuum cleaners
 Cyclones are used to separate airborne particles for the analysis of small cyclones to separate the oil from the exhaust air in the extract hoods are also used in industrial and professional kitchens

 Broadband Internet access, often abbreviated as broadband, is a high data rate Internet access — which is typically compared to dial-up access using a 56K modem
 dial-ap modem, 56 kbit / s se kam ke bitret tak simit hote hai or inhen puure telephone line ke upyog kii aavashyaktaa hoti he - jabaki broadband praudyogikiyaan, telephone ke upyog ko praayah bina baadhit kiye hue is dar se duguna pradaan karti hai
 Although broadband definitions use different minimum bandwidths, ranging from 64kbit / s to 2
0mbit / s, the 2006 OECD report defines broadband specifically as having a download data transfer rate of 256 kbit / s
 s is equal to or faster, while the United States Federal Communications Commission as of 2009 defines "basic broadband" as exceeding 768 kilobits per second, or 768,000 bits per second
 f seconds of data transmission speed, at least in one direction: downward or upward
 pravriti yah he ki jaise-jaise bazaar, tej sevaayen pradaan kar rahaa he vaise-vaise broadband kii paribhaasha kii seemaa ko badhanaa
 Data rates are defined in terms of maximum downloads because many common consumer broadband technologies, such as ADSL, are "asymmetric" - supporting significantly lower maximum upload data rates than downloads

 In practice, advertised bandwidth is not always available to customers as necessary, isps often provide connections to customers as much as their backbone connections or Neighborhood Access networks cannot handle, under the assumption that most Users will not use the full capacity of their connection most of the time

 Fiber optic communication, while recently used in the Fiber to the Premises and Fiber to the Curb schemes, has played an important role in enabling broadband Internet access for which it has a longer range than copper-wired technology Has made the transmission of information quite economical

 Load balancing takes two Internet connections and feeds them into your network as a double data rate, a more flexible Internet connection
 By choosing two independent Internet providers, the load balancing hardware will automatically use the line that has the least load, which means that if one line fails, the other one will automatically take over

 ISDN channel bonding technology has been used for video conference applications and broadband data transmission
 ISDN-PRI ke rup main gyaat, praathmik dar ISDN, 23 DS0 channelon vaali line he or iskaa kul bandwidth 1,544 kbit / s he
 The ISDN E1 line is an ISDN line with 30 DS0 channels and a total bandwidth of 2,048 kbit / s
 kyonki ISDN ek telephone aadhaarit utpaada he, line kii dheron shabdaawaliyaan or bhautik pahalu ko, dhwani sevaaon ke liye istemaal ISDN-PRI dwaara saajha kiya jaataa he
 An ISDN line can thus be managed for voice or data and various options, depending on the equipment used in a particular installation and based on the telephone company's central office switch offerings
 adhikansh ISDN-PRI data kaa istemaal vishaal PBX system kaa prayog karte hue, data ke bajaay telephone dhwani sanchaar ke liye kiya jaataa he

 By the way, T-1 services have very strict and stringent service requirements that increase the service provider's maintenance costs and may have to hire an additional technician 24 hours a day to repair it if the line goes bad
 T-1 linon kii mahangi or viniyamit prakruti kii vajah se, unhen saamaanya rup se ek likhit samjhaute ke praavdhaanon ke tahat sthapit kiya jaataa he or anubandh, aam taur par ek se teen saal tak kaa hota he
 However, there are generally few restrictions on a user's T-1 usage, uptime and bandwidth data rates can be guaranteed, service quality can be supported, and static IP address segments are commonly included
 chunki ek T-1 ko multah dhwani sancharan ke liye kalpit kiya gaya tha or chunki dhwani T-1 abhi bhi vyapak rup se kaarobaar main istemaal kiya jaataa he, yah nae graahak ke liye bhramit karne vaala ho saktaa he
 It is often best to consider the type of T-1 mentioned, for which the appropriate "data" or "sound" prefix is used to illustrate the difference between the two
 ek dhwani T-1, PSTN ke conection ke liye phone company ke kendriya karyaalay main samaapt ho jayega; ek data T-1, point of pressens yaa data centre par samaapt ho jayega
 T-1 rekha jo ek graahak ke parisar or POP yaa CO ke bich he use local loop kaha jaataa he
 The owner of a local loop does not necessarily own the network on the POP where your T-1 connects to the Internet and therefore a T-1 customer may have separate agreements with these two organizations
 ek T-1 ke liye namakaran vyapak rup se bhinn hota he, kuch kshetron main DS-1, ek T1
5, ek T1, yaa ek DS1 ke rup main ullekh kiya jaataa he
 Some of these attempt to distinguish between different aspects of the line, where these data standards are considered DS-1 and the physical structure of the trunk line as a T-1 or T-1
5
 They are also called leased lines, but this terminology is generally for data rates within 1
5 Mbit / s
 kabhi-kabhi, ek T-1 ko "lijd line" main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he yaa isse baahar rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Whatever it is called, it is naturally related to other broadband access methods, including T-3, SONET OC-3 and other T-carriers and optical carriers
 Additionally, a T-1 can be combined with more than one T-1, which will create an nxt-1, such as a 4xt-1-1 that is exactly 4 times the bandwidth of the T-1
 jab ek T-1 ko sthapit kiya jaataa he, to kai vikalp saamne hote hai: chune gaye vaahak main, simakan bindu ke sthaan main, channel sarvice unit ke prakaar main, yaa prayukt data sarvice unit main, prayukt WAN IP router, chune gaye bandwidth ke prakaar, aadi main
 T-1 line ke saath visheshikrut WAN kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jo graahak ke packet-aadhaarit network se internet yaa VPN data ko T-1 line par bhejtaa he jiske liye vah graahak parisar upaskar kaa upyog karata he
 The CPE is constructed from a specific CSU / DSU that converts the T-1's DS-1 data stream into a TCP / IP packet data stream, for use in a customer's Ethernet LAN
 yah ullekhneey he ki kai T-1 pradaata, seva anubandh ke hisse ke rup main vaikalpik rup se CPE kaa rakh-rakhaav karte hai or / yaa bech dete hai, jo simakan bindu or router, CSU, yaa DSU ke swaamitv ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Although a T-1 has a maximum of 1
544 Mbit / s, a fractional T-1 can be provided that uses only an integer multiple of 128 kbit / s for bandwidth
 is tareeke se, sambhav he ki ek graahak ek T-1 kaa keval 1 / 12th yaa 1 / 3 khride, jo kramshah 128 kbit / s or 512 kbit / s hoga
 The T-1 and fractional T-1 data lines are symmetric, which means that their upload and download data rates are the same
 jahaan yah uplabdh rahata he, internet se broadband conection kaa yah tarika yah sanket detaa he ki internet kaa abhigam bahut tej he
 However, just because Ethernet is being provided does not mean that the entire 10, 100 or 1000 Mbit / s can be used for direct Internet access
 ek college chatravaas main, udhaaharan ke liye, 100 Mbit / s ethernet abhigam ho saktaa he parisar network ke liye puri tarah uplabdh ho, lekin internet abhigam bandwidth 4xt-1 data dar ke kareeb ho saktaa he
 If you are sharing a broadband connection with others in a building, the leased line accessed bandwidth in the building will, of course, operate the user's data rate
 kuch sthanon main, haalanki, asli ethernet broadband abhigam uplabdh ho saktaa he
 This would be the most common case on a POP or data center and not in any common household or business
 When Ethernet Internet access is provided, it may be a fiber-optic or copper winding pair and the bandwidth will correspond to standard Ethernet data rates of up to 10 Gbit / s
 praathmik laabh yah he ki ethernet ke liye koi khaas hardware kii jarurat nahin he
 The latency in Ethernet is also very low

 There are several solutions for rural broadband, though each has its limitations and drawbacks
 Some options are better than others, but depend on how active the local phone company is to upgrade its rural technology
 wireles internet seva pradaata, gramin kshetron ke liye tezi se lokapriy broadband vikalp banate ja rahe hai
 The vision requirements of this technique can cause contact barriers in some areas of hilly and heavily forested areas
 haalanki, tegola pariyojna, duurastha scotland main ek safal praayogic kaary, yah darshata he ki betaar ek vyavhaarya vikalp ho saktaa he
 In addition, compared to hard-wired engagement, there are some security risks; The speed is quite slow and the network may be less stable due to interference from other wireless devices, weather and sight problems
 AI Geostationary orbiting satellites are capable of transmitting broadband data from the satellite company to each customer
 satellite internet, aam taur par broadband internet abhigam paane kaa sabase mahangaa tarika he, lekin gramin kshetron main yah cellular broadband ke alaava ekmaatr vikalp ho saktaa he
 However, the cost has decreased so much in recent years that it is becoming competitive with other broadband options

 Signal delay can range from 500 to 900 milliseconds, making it unsuitable for applications requiring real-time user input, such as certain multiplayer games and first-person shooters played over a connection
 Despite this, it is still possible to play many games, but the scope is limited to real-time strategy or turn-based games

 These problems are not noticeable only for basic email access and web browsing, and are rarely visible in most cases
 bhu-sthitik upgrahon ke liye is samasya ko samaapt karne kaa koi rasta nahin he
 This delay is mainly due to the long distance to be fixed, which will be present even at the speed of light
 Even if all other delays of the signal are eliminated, electromagnetic radio waves will take 500 milliseconds, or half a second, to travel from the ground level to the satellite and then back to Earth, the total source
 71,400 km to travel from destination to destination and 143,000 km for a return journey

 This is worse than most dial-up modem users experience, typically with a total latency of only 150–200 ms
 madhyam bhu kaksha or nimna bhu kaksha upgrahon main haalanki aisi lambi deree nahin he
 The current LEO massages of the Globalstar and Iridium satellites have a return delay of less than 40 ms, but their throughput is lower than broadband, at 64 kbps per channel

 The proposed new network is also built for very high throughput where the links are over 1 Gbps
 adhikansh upgrah internet pradaataaon ke paas ek FAP hota he
 The biggest disadvantage of satellite Internet, perhaps, is that these faps typically restrict a user's throughput to dial data rates after a particular "invisible wall" is hit
