 aise main, america nahin chahta tha ki vishwa main koi duusari shakti takanic ke maamle main uske mukaable main khadi ho
 Since rocket launch using supercomputers facilitates calculations at the time of a nuclear explosion, the US was also afraid that it would give India a new look to its nuclear power propagation program

 aap anya shabdon main inhen shaiva sampradaay ko maanane vaale anuyaayi kah sakate hai
 This community was founded in the 12th century by Mahatma Basavanam
 is mat ke upaask lingayat kehalaate hai
 The word is derived from the Kannada word lingwant
 ye log mukhyatah mahatma basavanna kii shikshaaon ke anugami hai
 The literal meaning of 'veerashaiva' is - 'one who is a supreme devotee of Shiva'
 kintu samay bitne ke saath virshaiv kaa tatvagyan darshan, sadhana, karmkand, saamaajik sanghatan, acharnium aadi anya sampradaayon se bhinn hote gaye
 Although Veerashaiva is also found in other parts of the country - Maharashtra, Andhra, Tamil region, etc
, Karnataka has the largest number of them
 shaiva log apane dharmik vishwaason or darshan kaa udgam vedon tathaa 28 shaivagamon se maanate hai
 Veerashaiva also does not show disbelief in the Vedas but in his philosophy, rituals and social reforms, such specialties have developed which are mainly derived from Shaivagams and such insight yogis who are known as 'vaadikars'
 12veen se 16 veen shatee ke bich lagbhag teen shatabdiyon main koi 300 vachanakaar hue hai jinamein se 30 striyaan rahi hai
 The most famous of these is Basava, who was the Prime Minister of the Jain king of Kalyan, Vizjal
 vah yogi mahatma hi na tha balki karmath sanghatankarta bhi tha jisane virshaiv sampradaay kii sthapana kii
 The goal of Vasava was to create a spiritual society in which caste, religion or women were not discriminated against
 vah karmkand sambandhi aadambar kaa virdohi tha or maansik pavitrataa evam bhakthi kii sachaai par bal detaa tha
 He was a supporter of the worship of only one God and tried to simplify the method of worship and meditation
 jati bhed kii samaapti tathaa striyon ke utthan ke kaaran samaaj main adbhut kranti utpann ho gai
 Jnana Yoga Bhakti Yoga and Karmayoga - All the three pledges are valid, but the most emphasis is on devotion

 As a result of spiritual practice, when a true devotee of God attains the highest state of samadhi, then a state of harmony, that is, a state of complete unity with each form of God, arises
 yahi manushya ke paramanand yaa moksh kii sthiti he
 It would be better to consider it as a complete solution and not to share equally in the ecstasy of union

 This is indicative of the state of the general consciousness of the human being reaching the highest order of the sex place from the first stage of the organ site
 sadhana arthath aadhyatmik anushaasan kii samoochee prakriya main bhakthi or sharan yane atmarpan par bal diya jaataa he
 Veerashaiva is sometimes called 'sharan' or Shiva Sharan of Mahatmas, ie people who have given themselves to Shiva's refuge
 unki sadhana shivayog kehalaati he
 Veerashaivism is basically monotheistic philosophy but is essentially beyond divine action and meditation and the existence of the world in our real experience cannot be explained without desire and action, hence Shiva's theory of power was conceived
 ishwar se ekta sthapit karne ke liye aadhyatmik aakankshi apni ek yaa teenon shaktiyon kaa prayog karata he
 The name of the use of love power is bhakti yoga, the knowledge of the use of thinking power and the name of the use of karma power is karma yoga
 inhen ke jariye parameshwar ke saath antim rup se ekta sthapit hoti he
 There is no doubt that the Veerashaivas also have temples, shrines, etc
 as in other sects, the difference being only between the deities who are worshiped
 jahaan tak virashaivon kaa sabandh he, devalayon yaa sadhana ke anya prakaaron kaa utana mahatv nahin he jitna isht ling kaa jisaki pratimaa sharir par dhaaran kii jaati he
 The spiritual master offers a favored penis to each Veerashaiva and bursts the sacred conspirator mantra 'om Nam Nam Shivaay' in his ear
 prayek virshaiv snanadi kar haath kii gadeli par isht ling kii pratimaa rakhkar chintan or dhyaan dwaara aradhana karata he
 Needless to say that every Veerashaiva is expected to possess high moral qualities like truthfulness, non-violence, fraternity
 vah niraamish bhoji hota he or sharaab aadi maadak vastuon se parhez karata he
 The summary of the directions issued by Basava in this regard is this - Do not steal, do not kill nor lie, do not praise or condemn others, treat all women other than your wife as mother
 veda, upanishad or shaivagam to sab sanskrit main he at: virshaiv vachanakaron ne unka saar or shaashvat satvon kaa sthoolansh kannada bhashaa evam sahitya main samavisht kar uski sambruddhi kii

 Different elements of cow dung bind soil particles by coming in contact with soil, but if these particles are very close to each other or attached then they remove them away, which causes air to enter the soil
 And the roots of plants breathe easily into it
 gobar kaa samuchit laabh khaad ke rup main hi prayog karke paaya ja saktaa he
 As just stated, the most beneficial use of cow dung may be in the form of manure, but due to the lack of burning wood in India, it is used more as fuel

 Dried goats burn well and the food made on them, due to cooking on a sweet flame, is delicious
 kintu gobar kaa uchit evam laabhprad upyog, jaisaa kaha ja chukaa he, khaad ke rup main hi he
 In all rich countries, wherever there are dung animals, manure is made from cow dung and fields are made fertile
 bharat main pehle gobar se khaad banane kii do vidhiyaan prachlit thim, kintu ek teesri vidhi bhi ab prachlit kii ja rahi he
 These methods are as follows: iske liye uchit aakaar ke gadhe, 20-25 foot lambey, 5-6 foot chaude tathaa 3 se lekar 10 foot gahare, khode jate hai or inamen gobar bhar diya jaataa he

 After that, leave the fertilizer to be made for about three months
 is vidhi main gadhe kaa taap kabhi 34 degree se upar nahin ja paata, kyonki gadhe main rasinic kriyaayein hawa ke abhaav main simit rahati hai

 Chemical changes occur in the presence of air, causing the temperature to be 60 ° C
 Is reached
 tah ko phir dabaa diya jaataa he or duusari patali tah us par daal di jaati he jiske taap badhane diya jaataa he
 In this way the pile becomes ten to twenty feet high, which is left in this state for a few months
 is reeti se vishesh laabh yah hota he ki taap badhane par ghaas, mote aadi hanikar paudhon ke beej, jo gobar main upasthit rah sakate hai, nasht ho jate hai
 Thus 5 to 6 tons of manure can be made from each animal

 udhaaharan ke liye, erik mazur or sahyogiyon ve sahakarmi nirdesh kehete hai| Peer Instruction Basic concepts are being presented, and then each student is required to apply them to explain those concepts to their fellow students that engage students during class through activities
 This approach is now "flipped" a variant of the technique known as "class" was used early

 However, after another study showed that training in assessment techniques had a positive effect on the performance of the individual student

 The permanent office of the Supreme Court is located in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, while many sub-branches of this court are functioning in important cities of Pakistan where cases are heard

 dalton prayogshaala yojana yaa 'dalton yojana' shikshan kaa ek concept he jise america kii shikshashastrini kumari hellen parkhst ne armbh kiya
 In 1912, US educationist Kumari Helen Parkhust created a new education plan for children between eight and 12 years of age
 yadhyapi yah yojana unke man main pehle se hi thi kintu uskaa vaastavik prayog san 1913 or 1915 ke bich kiya gaya
 Meanwhile, the First World War broke out and Kumari Parkhurst also loosened his plan for a few days
 vishwayuddh samaapt hone ke pashchaat san 1920 main unhone sanyukt raashtra america ke misachuset rajya ke dalton sthit vidyalayon main apni yojana prarambh kii
 After this, he set up a Children's University School and dealt with his Dalton Laboratory Scheme
 un dinon vidyalayon main adhyapakon kaa bolbalaa tha
 Like animals, students were locked in a classroom enclosure
 adhyapakgana jo kuch batala dete the use ve ghotakar suna dete the
 At the time of narration, there was a slight manipulation that the sons were tuned
 praaia: vidhyalay kii kakshaayen bhi andhere, sankare or kam havawale kamaron main hoti thim
 There were locks on the students' mouths
 medhaavi balak ko teevr gati se aage badhane kaa avasar nahin tha or matimand baalkon ko apni mand gati se ruk rukkar chalane kii suvidha nahin thi
 Although academics such as Rousseau, Paestalouzi, and Harbart wrote and spoke a lot on the child's independent pedagogy, most schools still had an empire of penal, ancient cults
 in sab baton se sampurna shikshakram nitant neeras or rochaktashunya ho gaya tha
 Kumari Helen Parkhurst's gentle feminine heart was greatly offended by this harsh, uncaring and dull environment, so she launched her Dalton Plan in the United States
 ve chaahatin to is yojana ke saath meria mountessori ke samaan apana naam bhi jod deteen kintu unka vishwaas he ki kisi shiksha pranali ko apane naam se jodna or use band dena naitik drushti se thik nahin he
 It has been his wish that this scheme should not be bound by special rules and restrictions and that is why he has given big discounts for different countries and places
 san 1915 se 1918 tak parkharst ne celifornia main mountessri pranali kaa bhi prayog kiya ore isiilie kuch log is pranali ko mountessri kii upaj maanate hai kintu tathy yah nahin he
 There are two main principles of this laboratory scheme
 in siddhanton se spasht he ki yah dalton yojana koi nai shikshapranali nahin he varan ek nai prakaar kii vidhyalay vyavastha he
 In this, subjects are taught only in other schools, but in this, the manner, results and type of studies differ
 isamen samoochaa paathyakram suvidhajanak masik chhapi hui theke kii kaaryayojna ke rup main bott liya jaataa he jisamen chhuttiyon ke liye, padhe hue paath kii aavriti ke liye or vidhyaarthiyon ke swat: abhyaas ke liye samay chhod diya jaataa he
 Each lesson subject is divided into ten monthly action plans of one year and the month of this school is of twenty days
 is theke ke kaary main nity kaa kaary nirdisht hota he jise samasya kehete hai jaise bhugol ke ek theke ke kaary main bharat ke bhugol kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he, to yah puraa masik yaa vrihad theke kaa kaary he or uske chote bhaag, jaise bhuprakruti, jalwaayu aadi samasyaayen yaa dainik kaary hai
 For some of these problems, two days and half days are given for some
 in samasyaon main padhane kaa, prashnon ke uttar dene kaa, maanchitr khinchne yaa vivaran likhane kaa tathaa anya kaary karne kaa nirdesh diya jaataa he jisase chaatr ko shrey mili
 Each student accepts this work as a contract and completes the specified work given for a month in a fixed time
 isamen swatantraaa yahi he ki vidhyaarthee ek maas main puure kiye janevaale kaary ko apni ichha ke anusaar chaahe jis kram se or jis gati se puraa kar sakate hai
 If they wish, they can complete the work given for one month in ten days
 kintu kaary samaapt karte hi ve agle maheene ke kaary ko nahin le sakate
 They can study the book they want from the library in the remaining time
 jab chaatr masik kaary kaa theka lete hai to ve yah bhi vachan dete hai ki is kaary ko puraa karne ke liye na ham kisi ko sahaayta denge na ham kisi se sahaayta lenge
 Students have such a leeway that they have to take consent from their mentor or their classmates, but they have to complete the work automatically
 is yojana main kakshaayen lupt ho jaati hai or prayek kaksha prayogshaala ban jaati he
 In these various laboratories, all the auxiliary materials of those subjects, books, drawings, sketches, images, instruments, etc
 exist
 vibhinn shreniyon ke jo vidhyaarthee kisi ek vishay kaa kaary puraa karnaa chaahate hai ve sabhi us vishay kii kaksha prayogshaala main baithkar saamagree kaa upyog karke apana kaary puraa kar sakate hai
 In this way, instead of first, second, third grade, laboratory of Hindi, laboratory of history, laboratory of history and subjects of geography, science, music, painting etc
 are made in the school
 isiilie vahaan na ghante lagate hai na koi bandhi hui samaysarani yaa dincharya hi rahati he
 The job of teachers under this scheme is that samay to nasht nahin karte
 If the history teacher wants to write an article on Shivaji, then he can put this work in the linguist's work plan whose historical part should be seen by the teacher of history and the language part is the teacher of language
 isse chaatr bhi do niabandh likhane kii kathinaayee se batch jaataa he
 In this scheme, the teacher has no right to interfere with the work of the student, it is the right of the student to seek consent and advice from the teacher if necessary
 chaatro ke liye jo das maas kii vaarshik theke kii kaaryayojna banaai jaati he usamen nimnaankit baaten aati hai : Preface - a brief introduction to the work given for a month in a few words
 vishyang - jo vishay diya jaay uske us vishesh ang, bhaag, paath yaa ansh kaa ullekh spasht kiya jaay or yah bhi bataaya jaay kis ang ke liye kitna kaam apekshit he
 Problems - Mention all the things that students have to contemplate or think, such as making instruments, making maps or doing scientific or philosophical discussions, etc
 adhiktar bhashaa ke paath main samasyaayen kam hoti hai
 Problems are more in subjects like history, geography, science and economics, for which the student has to do special studies and draw results on his own behalf
 likhit kaary - likhane ke kaary kii puri suchi di jaae or jis tithi ko lekh lenaa ho uskaa spasht ullekh ho
 Memorable works - Mention all the parts, poems or paragraphs that are intended to be memorized
 sammelan - kaaryayojna main un tithiyon kaa bhi ullekh ho jab puri kaksha ko ek saath baitaakar us vishay par baatcheet kerani ho yaa kuch vishesh samajhaana ho
 Supporting books - Along with the action plan, the names of those books and journals, their chapters and pages should be given from which it is necessary to seek help
 pragativivaran - baalkon ko yah bhi batala diya jaae ki ve apni pragati kaa lekha kis prakaar banaaen jisase unamem yah aatmavishvaas bana rahe or ve samajhate rahen ki hamane itnaa gyaan praapt kiya, itnaa kaary kiya, itani unnati kii
 For this, the progress sheet remains in the class and also with the student, in which he keeps on marking the progress of his work
 soochnapatt kaa adhyayan - yadi prayogshaala ke soochnapatt par koi chitra, maanchitr athwa lekh aadi padhane ke liye taangne kii yojana ho to uskaa bhi ullekh kar diya jaae
 Departmental exemption - While preparing the monthly action plan, teachers should divide the work together in such a way that there is no frequency of the same type of work and unnecessary burden on the student
 isi yojana kaa vyapak or vyaavhaarik rup vishyayojna naam se chal padaa he jiske anusaar vartmaan vidyalayon kii kakshapaddati kaa nirvaah karte hue varsh bhar main ek vishay ko padhaane kii masik kram se puri yojana bana lee jaati he
