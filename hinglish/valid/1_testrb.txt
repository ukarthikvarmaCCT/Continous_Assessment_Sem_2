 Around 1700, at the height of its power, it controlled much of the Indian subcontinent - extending from present-day Bangladesh in the east to Baluchistan in the west and from Kashmir in the north to the Cauvery Valley in the south

 During this time, a highly centralized administration was created connecting various regions

 The foundation of the Umairids Empire was established by Prince Babur of the Timurid dynasty around the early 1500s, when he captured Doab and controlled the fertile region of Sindh and the lower valley of the Indus River by the eastern region of Khorasan
 1526 main, babar ne dilli ke sultaanon main aakhri sultan, ibrahim shah lodi, ko panipat ke pehle yuddh main haraaya
 To secure the establishment of his new kingdom, Babur faced a Rajput treaty in the Battle of Khanwa led by Rana Sanga of Chittor

 Babur's son Humayun succeeded him in 1530, but Pashtun suffered major reverses at the hands of Sher Shah Suri and effectively defeated most of the new empire before moving from territorial state
 1540 se humayun ek nirvasit shaasha bane, 1554 main safawid darbar main pahunche jabaki abhi bhi kuch kile or chote kshetra unki sena dwaara niyantrit the
 But when Pashtun fell into disarray after Sher Shah Suri's death, Humayun returned with a mixed army, mobilized more troops and managed to reconquer Delhi in 1555
 humayun ne apni patni ke saath makaran ke khurdure ilaakon ko paar kiya, lekin yatra kii nishthurataa se bachaane ke liye apane shishu bete jilaluddin ko peeche chhod gaye
 Jalaluddin was better known as Akbar in later years

 He became known as Akbar

 Shah Jahan started building the famous Taj Mahal in Agra which was built by the Persian architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori as a tomb for Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of Shah Jahan, who died while giving birth to his 14th child

 Between the mid-16th century and the end of the 17th century, the Mughal Empire was the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent
 1526 main sthapit, yah nammaatr 1857 tak bachaa rahaa, jab vah british raaj dwaara hataaya gaya
 This dynasty is sometimes known as Timurid dynasty because Babur was a descendant of Timur
 faraghna vaadi se aae ek turki muslim timurid sipahasaalar babar ne mogul rajvansh ko sthapit kiya
 He attacked parts of northern India and defeated the ruler of Delhi, Ibrahim Shah Lodhi in 1526 in the first battle of Panipat
 mogul samrajya ne uttari bharat ke shaskaon ke rup main dilli ke sultan kaa sthaan liya
 Over time, the kingdom established by Umer crossed the boundary of the Sultan of Delhi, eventually besieging a large part of India and earning the title of empire

 However, Sher Shah's untimely death and the military incompetence of his successors enabled Humayun to regain his throne in 1555

 The largest part of Mughal expansion was accomplished during the reign of Akbar

 The first six emperors, who enjoyed both "lawful" and "rail" powers, usually refer to him by just one name, a title that was adopted by each of the nobles upon his accession

 Akbar introduced certain important policies, such as religious liberalism, the inclusion of Hindus in the affairs of the empire and political alliances / marriage with the Hindu Rajput caste, which were innovative to their environment
 unhone sher shah suri kii kuch nitiyon ko bhi apanaaya tha, jaise kii apane prashasan main samrajya ko sarkaron main vibhajit karnaa
 These policies undoubtedly helped maintain power and the stability of the empire, were protected by two immediate successors, but were abandoned by Aurangzeb, who adopted a policy that had little place for religious tolerance

 This enterprise drained the resources of the empire which aroused strong resistance within the Marathas, Sikhs of Punjab and Hindu Rajputs
 aurangzeb ke shasankaal ke baad, samrajya main giravat hui
 Beginning with Bahadur Zafar Shah I, the Mughal emperors declined in power and became fictitious chieftains, initially controlled by various diverse courtesans and later by several rising chieftains

 The Marathas were defeated before the British got most of the territories of this empire in India
 1803 main, andhe or shaktiheen shah alam II ne aupchaarik rup se british east india company kaa sangrakshan sweekaar kiya
 The British government had started calling the already weak Mughals the "king of Delhi" rather than the "emperor of India", which was formally exercised in 1803, which led to the uneasy implication of the Indian King moving on from the British Emperor

 phir bhi, kuch dashakon ke baad, BEIC ne samraat ke nammaatr naukaron ke rup main or unke naam par, apane niyantran ke adheen kshetron main shashan jari rakhaa, 1827 main yah shishtachar bhi khatm ho gaya tha
 When some rebels of the Sepoy Mutiny announced their allegiance to Bahadur Zafar Shah II, a descendant of Shah Alam, the British decided to abolish this institution altogether
 unhone 1857 main antim mogul samraat ko pad se giraaya or unhen burma ke liye nirvasit kiya, jahaan 1862 main unki mrityu ho gai
 Thus came the end of the Mughal dynasty, which contributed an important chapter to the history of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan

 Kannada is like other Dravidian languages and Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam are similar to this language
 kannada sanskrit bhashaa se bahut prabhavit he or sanskrit ke bahut saare shabd kannada main bhi usee arth main prayukt hote hai
 The Government of India has also declared Kannada as a classical language of India
 kannada tathaa karnataka shabdon kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main bhinn-bhinn mat hai
 If a scholar is of the opinion that the word Kannada is derived from "kaniruduanadu" meaning "black clay country", then according to other scholars, "kannadu" from "kapitu Nadu" means "fragrant country" and "kannadu" from "kannadu"
 Derivation has taken place
 kannada sahitya ke itihaaskaar aar

 Some grammars state that Kannada is a form of the Sanskrit word "karnat"
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki "karnayo atati iti karnataka" arthath jo kaanon main goonjataa he vah karnataka he
 In ancient texts, the words Kannada, Karnat, Karnataka have been used in synonyms

 In the second century Tamil poem titled "shilappadikaram", the name of the Kannada speakers is "karunadar"

 The word 'karnataka' has become distorted in English to Carnatic or Canara, then Canarias to Canara
 uttari bharat kii hindi tathaa anya bhashaaon main kannada shabd ke liye canadee, kannadi, kenara, canari kaa prayog miltaa he
 Nowadays the words Karnataka and Kannada are used in a definite sense - Karnataka is the name of the state and "kannada" language

 In fact, Tulu is a confirmed dialect of Kannada which is spoken in Dakshina Kannada district

 Kodagu is spoken in Kurg and the other three are prevalent in Nilgiri district

 Kannada was also spoken during the ramayana-mahabharata-era, even though there is no written form of Kannada before BC

 Among these inscriptions, the inscription found from a place called Hulmidi is the oldest, which dates to 450 AD

 Often prose is used only in pre-eighth century inscriptions and later inscriptions have excellent specimens of poetry containing poems
 in shilalekhon kii bhashaa jahaan sugathit tathaa praudh he vahaan usapar sanskrit kaa gaharaa prabhaav dikhaai detaa he
 Thus even though there is evidence of prose-poetry in Kannada based on inscriptions dating back to the 8th century, the work of writing in Kannada progressed after the name of the first available Kannada text, "kaviraj Marg", and the language continued to develop

 In the two-party parliamentary system of government, a hung parliament is formed when no major political party gets an absolute majority in the parliament according to the number of seats
 ise kabhi-kabhaar santulit sansad yaa bina kisi niyantran vaali vidhayika bhi kaha jaataa he
 If the legislature is bicameral and the government is only responsible to the lower house, then the term "hung parliament" is used only for that house
 do party pranali ke adhikansh chunaavon main ek party ko purna bahumat praapt ho jaataa he or vah jald hi ek nai sarkaar kaa gathan kar leti he; "trishanku sansad" is dhaanche kaa ek apwaad he or ise aniyamit yaa avaanchhneeya mana ja saktaa he
 One or both main parties may try to form a coalition government with some other smaller parties, or a minority government with the help of some other parties or independent members
 yadi ye prayaas vifal ho jate he, sansad bhang karne or nae sire se chunaav karaae jane ke atirikt koi vikalp nahin bachataa he
 In a multi-party system, as is usually the case in legislatures elected by proportional representation, negotiation for the formation of post-election coalition government is quite common; The term "hung parliament" is not used
 united kingdom, australia or canada, in sabhi kii vartmaan sansad trishanku sansad hai
 It is quite unusual for Commonwealth nations to have such a large number of hung parliaments at the national level

 However, the two Reform Acts greatly broadened the franchise and reorganized the constituencies, coincidentally at the same time, considerable changes were seen in Irish politicians
 1885 ke aam chunaavon ke baad kisi bhi party ko purna bahumat nahin mila
 The Irish Parliamentary Party held the key to power and offered Irish self-government as a condition for its support

 The elections of January 1910 and December 1910 gave rise to a hung parliament in which the ruling Liberal Party and the Conservative Party won almost identical seats
 aisa sansadeey sankat tathaa lebar party ke udai ke kaaran hua tha
 This did not happen for many years after the hung parliament that emerged as a result of the 1929 elections; Meanwhile, the Labor Party moved out of the Liberal Party and became one of the two major parties
 1929 ke chunaavon ke baad se, britain main do aam chunaavon main trishanku sansad saamne ai he
 The first was the election of February 1974 and the parliament formed lasted only till October
 The second election was in May 2010, resulting in a hung parliament and the Conservative Party as the largest party
 teen mukhya partiyon ke parinaam is prakaar the - conservatives - 307, lebar- 258, libral democrates - 57
 The loss of a by-election may lead to the end of a weakened majority of the government, and the creation of a hung parliament by members of Parliament joining the opposition, or the resignation of mps of the House of Common
 aisa disambar 1996 main jon major kii conservative sarkaar or 1978 ke madhya main james calhan kii lebar sarkaar ke saath hua tha; is baad kii avadhi ko asantosh kaa sheetkaal ke naam se janaa jaataa he

 Studies related to the hung parliament include David Butler's Governing Without a Majority: Dilemmas for Hung Parliament in Britain and Vernon Bogdanore's 'multi-party Politics and the Constitution'
 canada kii vartmaan sansad, 38veen tathaa 39veen sansad kii hi tarah trishanku sansad he; haalanki, canada main is shabd kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Instead, the term "minority government" or "minority parliament" is used
 haalanki alpsankhyak sarkarein aksar alpakaalik hoti hai, pradhanmantri stephen harper ke netritv vaali vartmaan alpsankhyak sarkaar farvari 2006 ke baad se satta main bane rahane main safal rahi he

 Hung parliaments at the federal level are rare in Australia, as the system here is almost identical to a two party system in which the Australian Labor Party competes against a coalition of Conservative parties
 1910 se pehle kisi bhi party ko pratinidhi sabha main purna bahumat praapt nahin tha kyonki vahaan do gaiyr-lebar partiyaan pratispardhaa main thim

 In the 2010 federal election, outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard received the support of four independent members and remained in power
 trishanku sansad rajya str par kahin adhik saamaanya hai
 The Tasmania Legislative Assembly and a unicameral parliament of the Australian Capital Territory are both elected by the heyer-clark proportional representation, so a hung parliament usually appears in elections

 Alternatively, a minority government with trust and supply agreements can be formed based on previously agreed policy concessions or issue-based support
 farvari 1974 ke aam chunaav main vartmaan pradhanmantri edward hith ne vipakshi lebar party kii tulana main kam site jeetne ke baavjood ek gathbandhan sarkaar banane kaa prayaas karne ke liye istipha dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 They were unable to do so, so the Labor Party led by Harold Wilson formed a minority government
 britain ke 2010 ke aam chunaavon main ek or trishanku sansad astitv main ai or ek sthir sarkaar banane kaa prayaas karne ke liye vyapak vichaar-vimarsh kiya gaya
 This resulted in the formation of a coalition government which was also an absolute majority government; This government was a coalition government of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats winning the majority of seats and votes in the election

 In other words, it can be said that psychology is a science that studies observational behavior in a systematic way and studies the mental and somatic processes within the creature like - thinking, feeling etc
 and their relation with the phenomena of the environment
 is
 is pariprekshya main manovigyaan ko vyavhaar evam maansik prakriyaaon ke adhyayan kaa vigyaan kaha gaya he
 'behavior' includes both human behavior and animal behavior
 maansik prakriyaaon ke antargat samvedan, avdhaan, pratyakshan, siikhnaa, smriti, chintan aadi aate hai
 Psychology is the science of experience, its purpose is to analyze the elements of the process of consciousness, to find out the nature of their interactions and the rules that determine them
 manovigyaan kii paribhaashayen :- In pre-scientific times, psychology was a branch of philosophy
 jab wilhelm vunt ne 1879 main manovigyaan kii pehla prayogshaala kholaa, manovigyaan darshanashastra ke changul se nikalakar ek swatantra vigyaan kaa darja paa sakane main samarth ho sakaa
 Along with the scientific tendency on psychology, philosophy has also had a great influence

 lock kaa anumaan tha ki manushya ke swabhaav ko samajhane ke liye vichaaron ke strot ke vishay main jaananaa aavashyak he
 He propounded the theory of the interrelationship of ideas and stated that thoughts are like an element and the brain analyzes them
 unka kahana tha ki prayek vastu main praathmik gun swayan vastu main nihit hote hai
 Secondary qualities are not inherent in the object, but through the particular thing, they must be understood
 barkale ne kaha ki vaastaviktaa kii anubhuti padaarth ke rup main nahin varan pratyay ke rup main hoti he
 He expressed his thoughts about the sensation of distance and said that with the help of anointing blur and automatic adjustment, we get a sense of distance

 is vichaar kii prishthbhumi main newton ke dwaara pratipaadit tathy the jinamein kaha gaya tha ki uttejk ke hataa lene ke baad bhi samvednaa hoti rahati he
 Hartley laid more emphasis on the principle of associativeness, stating the rules of association
 hartle ke baad lagbhag 70 varsh tak saahcharyavad ke kshetra main koi ullekhneey kaary nahin hua
 Meanwhile, in Scotland, Reid described the articulation of objects, and said that it is necessary to distinguish between objectification and sensation
 kisi vastu vishesh ke gunon kii samvednaa hoti he jabaki us sampurna vastu kaa pratyakshikaran hota he
 Sensation is limited only to the properties of an object, but through articulation, we get to know the whole thing

 Harbart contributed significantly in giving psychology a form
 unke matanusaar manovigyaan anubhavvaad par aadhaarit ek tathvik, maatraatmak tathaa vishleshatmak vigyaan he
 He gave psychology a physical basis in place of elemental and Lautse made further progress in this direction
 manovaigyanik samasyaon ke vaigyanik adhyayan kaa shubharambh unke aupchaarik swaroop aane ke baad pehle se ho chukaa tha
 In 1834, Weber published his experimental research on tangentials in a book form
 san 1831 main feknar swayan ekadish dhara vidyut ke maapan ke vishay par ek atyant mahatvapurn lekh prakashit kar chuke the
 a few years later in 1847, Helmo presented his scientific article on energy conservation to the people
 iske baad san 1856 i, 1860 i tathaa 1866 idri main unhone "optic" naamak pustak teen bhaagon main prakashit kii
 In 1851 AD and 1860 AD, Fékner also published a psychologically important book titled "elements of Psychophysics" in the German language, in which he duly formulated three special systems of studying psychological problems in the environment of scientific method
 Described: Middle error method, minimum change method and static exciton method
 aaj bhi manovaigyanik prayogshaalaon main inhen pranaaliyon ke aadhaar par anek mahatvapurn anusandhan kiye jate hai
 In scientific psychology, there are two other important names after Fekner: Helmolts and Wilhelm Wunt
 helmolts ne anek prayogon dwaara drushtirdriya vishyak mahatvapurn niyamon kaa pratipaadan kiya
 In this context, he raised the scientific existence of psychology through research work on the articulation
 vunt kaa naam manovigyaan main vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 He established the first laboratory of psychology at the University of Leipzig in 1879 AD
 manovigyaan kaa aupchaarik rup paribhaashit kiya
 In the laboratory of Leipzig, Wunt and his colleagues conducted remarkable experiments on various problems of psychology, in which time-reaction experiments are particularly important
 kriyavigyaan ke vidvan hering, bhautikee ke vidvan maikh tathaa ji i mular ke naam bhi ullekhneey hai
 Herring was one of the leading promoters of phenomenology and can be credited with the influence of this tendency on psychology
 maikh ne shaareerik paribhraman ke pratyakshikaran par atyant prabhaavshaalee prayogtmak anusandhan kiye
 He also laid the foundation for modern positivism
 ji i mular vastav main darshan tathaa itihaas ke vidhyaarthee the kintu feknar ke saath patravyavhaar ke falswaroop unka dhyaan manodaihik samasyaon kii ore gaya
 He did research work in the field of memory and vision by psychodynamic methods
 isi sandarbh main unhone "jast niyam" kaa bhi pataa lagaaya arthath agar samaan shakti ke do saahchary hon to duhraane ke falswaroop purana saahchary nae kii apeksha adhik drudh ho jayega 
 The pursuit of behavioral rules was the main objective of psychology
 saidhantik str par vibhinn drushtikon prastut kiye gaye
 In the field of psychology, the main branches of structuralism, functionalism, behaviorism, Gestaltism and psychoanalysis etc
 developed around 1912 AD
 in sabhi vaadon ke pravartak is vishay main ekamat the ki manushya ke vyavhaar kaa vaigyanik adhyayan hi manovigyaan kaa uddeshy he
 There was a difference of opinion among them as to what is the best way to achieve this objective
 saranchnawad ke anuyaayiyon kaa mat tha ki vyavhaar kii vyakhya ke liye un shaareerik sanrachanaon ko samajhnaa aavashyak he jinke dwaara vyavhaar sambhav hota he
 Practitioners said that instead of physical structure, there should be more emphasis on observable and visible behavior
 isi aadhaar par baad main watasan ne vyavahaarwad kii sthapana kii
 The Gestaltists considered articulation to be the bedrock of behavioral problems
 vyavhaar main susangathit rup se vyavastha praapt karne kii pravriti mukhya he, aisa unka mat tha
 Freud attempted to explain by establishing psychoanalytic that most of the causes of our behavior are determined by unconscious processes
 aadhunik manovigyaan main in sabhi "vaadon" kaa ab ekmaatr aitihaasik mahatv rah gaya he
 In order to facilitate studies in psychology, different branches have been divided
 prayogtmak manovigyaan main mukhya rup se unheen samasyaon kaa manovaigyanik vidhi se adhyayan kiya jane laga jinhen darshanik pehle chintan athwa vichaarvimarsh dwaara sulajhaate the
 That is, sensation and articulation
 baad main iske antargat seekhney kii prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan bhi hone laga
 Experimental psychology is the oldest branch of modern psychology
 manushya kii apeksha pashuon ko adhik niyantrit paristhitiyon main rakhaa ja saktaa he, saath hi saath pashuon kii shaareerik rachana bhi manushya kii bhanti jatil nahin hoti
 Knowledge of behavioral rules can be easily done by experimenting on animals
 san 1912 i ke lagbhag thornadike ne pashuon par prayog karke tulanaatmak athwa pashu manovigyaan kaa vikaas kiya
 But to know how far the results obtained on animals can apply in relation to humans, knowledge of developmental order was also necessary
 iske atirikt vyavhaar ke niyamon kaa pratipaadan usee dasha main sambhav ho saktaa he jab ki manushya athwa pashuon ke vikaas kaa purna evam uchit gyaan ho
 Keeping this context in mind, developmental psychology was born
 san 1912 i ke kuch hi baad macdugal ke prayatnon ke falswaroop samaaj manovigyaan kii sthapana hui, yadhyapi isaki buniyaad samaaj vaigyanik harbart spencer dwaara bahut pehle rakhi ja chuki thi
 Gradually, the influence of psychology on various branches of knowledge was felt
 aashaa vyakt kii gai ki manovigyaan anya vishyon kii samasyaayen sulajhane main upyogi ho saktaa he
 At the same time, various aspects of the problems being studied came to the fore
 parinamswaroop manovigyaan kii nai-nai shakhaon kaa vikaas hota gaya
 Some of these have just recently originated, particularly notable are motivational psychology, authoritative psychology, mathematical psychology
 manovigyaan kii moolbhoot evam anuprayukt - donon prakaar kii shakhaaen hai

 In this, all the people who believe in and practice the views of religions and religions like Sanatani, Aryasamaji, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh etc

 Dr
 Hedgewar himself was so excited that in one of his address he said Key: - “sangh ke janmkaal ke samay kii paristhiti badi vicitra si thi, hinduon kaa hindusthan kahana us samay niraa paagalpan samajha jaataa tha or kisi sanghathan ko hindu sanghathan kahana desh droh tak ghoshit kar diya jaataa tha” l In the tragic situation that Dr
 Hedgewar expressed, the effort of the leadership of the newly formed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha - with the courage among the Hindu youth, resonated with the slogan "hindusthan Hindus - not anyone's father"
 Dr
 Hedgewar said in these words: - “kai sajjan yah kehete hue bhi nahin hichkichaate kii hindusthan keval hinduo kaa hi kaise? yah to un sabhi logon kaa he jo yahan basate hai l khed he kii is prakaar kaa kathan / akshep karne vaale sajjanon ko raashtra shabd kaa arth hi gyaat nahin l keval bhoomi ke kisi tukade ko raashtra nahin kehete l ek vichaar-ek aachaar-ek sabhyataa evam parampara main jo log puraatan kaal se rahete chale aae hai unheen logon kii samskruti se raashtra banataa he l is desh ko hamaare hi kaaran hindusthan naam diya gaya he l duusare log yadi samopchaar se is desh main basna chaahate hai to avashya bas sakate hai l hamane unhen na kabhi manaa kiya he na karenge l kintu jo hamaare ghar atithi ban kar aate hai or hamaare hi gale par churi pherane par utaaru ho jate hai unke liye yahan ratti bhar bhi sthaan nahin milegaa l sangh kii is vichaardhaara ko pehle aap thik thaak samaj lijie l” On another occasion, Dr
 Hedgewar had said, "the Sangh wants only the Hindusthan Hindus - to make this motto true," similar to other countries, "because of the Hindus" - what Hindus in this country would say That will be the former direction
 This is the only thing that the Sangh knows, there is no need for the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to fall into any other crisis
