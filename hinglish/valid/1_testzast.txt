 To cite an example, in 1978, Genentech developed synthetic humanized insulin by joining its genes with a vector inserted into the plasmid bacterium Escherichia coli
 insulin, vyapak rup se madhumeh ke ilaaj ke liye upyog kiya he, pehle se vadhashala jaanwaron ke agnyashay se nikaala gaya tha
 The resulting genetically engineered bacterium is capable of producing vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low prices
 According to a 2003 study by the International Diabetes Federation on the use and availability of insulin in its member countries, synthetic 'human' insulin significantly More expensive in most countries where both synthetic 'human' and animal insulin are commercially available Examples of the IDF, synthetic 'human' insulin average price twice as pork insulin within European countries

 After moving from there, he settled in the Jangladesha region of Rajasthan and came to Jhunjhunu and started living on the Nehra mountain

 Sardar Jujhar Singh became a general in the Nawab's army when he was young

 jujhar singh ne punjab, bharatpur, braj ke jat raajaaon or gokula ke balidaan kii charchaa sun rakhi thi

 Brihatkatha is poetry written in the Pachachi language by Gunadhya
 'vrihatkatha' kaa shabdic arth he - 'lambi katha'
 There are a hundred thousand verses in it

 Kanbhuti and Gunadhay wrote the same original anecdote in the Prakriti Paaschi languages respectively
 mahakavi kshemendra ne use brihatkatha-manjari naam se, sankshipt rup se, sanskrit main likhaa
 Then during the reign of Kashmiraj Anantadeva, katha-saritsagar was composed
 is upaakhyaan ko bharatiyon ne bahut aadar diya or vatsaraj udayan kai naatakon or upakhyanon main nayak banaae gaye

 The serial begins with a group of people who consider themselves ordinary, who gradually learn that they have special abilities
 The events reflect their reactions to these powers and show how the search affects their personal and professional lives
 At the same time, many ordinary people are investigating the origins and limitations of capabilities

 This season consists of parts three and four titled Villain and Fugitive respectively
 In the beginning of Villain, Zailer is shown regaining his lost strength, which was the final scene of the conclusion of Generations
 Tim Kring says that the new version will bring an army of villains to the show, hence its title
 Part three begins with the assassination attempt and its consequences on Nathan Petrelli
 In addition, many villains escape from level 5 confinement and the company attempts to capture them
 Arthur Petrelli survives systemic nerve damage with the help of Adam Monroe's medical ability and eventually recruits some new villains and later implicates Mohinder Suresh, Nathan Petrelli, Tracy Strauss, Eli Bishop, and Xiler

 Kring originally designed the series to have an ever-changing role
 However, his plan changed when he found out that the original cast was highly popular in the audience, so for the second season, he took on most of the first season's cast, along with a few additional actors who had received star ratings
 In its first season, the show went on to become the third-largest cast in American primetime television, behind Desperate Housewives and Lost, by featuring 12 main actors simultaneously
 Although the cast page of the first season of NBC listed only ten characters, Leonard Roberts, who first appeared in the series' fifth episode, was an additional member joining the original full-time cast
 In the eleventh episode of the first season, Jack Coleman was promoted from a recurring role to a twelfth full-time member

 Heroes developed in early 2006, when Tim Kring, creator of nbc's Crossing Jordan, introduced the concept to the program
 Kring wanted to create a "big ensemble saga" that could connect with audiences
 He started thinking about how big, scary and complex the world is and he wanted to create a series focused on characters that could do something about it
 Kring realized that there were not so many big characters in a police officer or medical drama who could save the world
 He considered superheroes, ordinary people who discover extraordinary abilities while living in the real world and reality
 Casting directors Jason La Padura and Natalie Hart meet some ventures such as Milo Ventimiglia, who in the first episode "introduced the common man as a character drama with increasing reality
" a reality that was brought to light through the work of production designer Ruth Ammon
 Kring wanted points in the series that incorporated the characters and their world

 The episode has a different structure: after a brief recap of relevant events, each show begins with a puzzle, sometimes beginning with the scene that was introduced in the previous week's episode
 Mostly Mohinder Suresh talks about the title or event in a philosophical voice
 At a dramatic turn, the screen cuts to the graphic title, which shows that the Earth is turning into a solar eclipse, with the Belly Bead performance showing the Heroes logo and the musical pause written by Kring himself
 The title of the episode is usually shown after the title scene, which is followed by a commercial break
 After the first commercial break, the title of the episode usually appears on an earthly object within the scene
 The title is presented as a chapter, each chapter having a number, which connects it to the episode number of that part
 The list of initial names usually appears in alphabetical sequences of the preceding name
 Many characters' stories are shown throughout the episode
 Sometimes these stories are lonely incidents, while sometimes the stories of other characters come in and move forward
 At this point, Suresh provides the final voiceover and most of the episodes end with an interesting twist or suspense, which is shown just before the smash cut with the "continue to" graphic
 jab lekhan team ek episod par kaam karti he, prayek lekhak ek charitra letaa he or uske irdagird ke akele drishy likhata he

 The second season saw a WGA writer strike, meaning that only 11 of the planned 24 episodes would be produced
 This forced the producers to redesign the season by incorporating only Generations out of the three episodes planned according to the predetermined plan
 The third planned part, Exodus, which originally reflected the effects of 138 variants of the peace virus in the story, was canceled
 The fourth planned part, Villain, was replaced in the third part and moved to season three
 The closing scenes of part two of "powerless" had to be re-filmed due to the cancellation of Exodus, and all the ends had to be tied to the loose ends of Generations

" Tim Molloy of TV Guide stated that Heroes will return to their origins from the fourth part
 The fugitive is an attempt to attract new viewers and bring back viewers who left the show due to excessive characters and storylines
 Fugitives begin with Nathan Petrelli telling the president that there are people who have superhuman abilities
 The President authorizes Nathan to capture such individuals, and all the main characters, except Xylor, gather to escape the reach of Nathan's agents in an attempt to locate his biological father
 Heroes enlist the help of a mysterious colleague, Rebel, who is later revealed to be Micah Sanders

 Music from the first season is composed by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman with music engineer Michael Perfitt and vocals by Shankar
 Each episode has an average of thirty to thirty five minutes of music
 Melvoin and Coleman were added to Heroes because of their previous work with executive producer Alan Arkush
 Tim Kring gave the pair general instructions including the emotion and direction of each character
 Kring wanted incredibly unusual music and therefore gave Wendy and Lisa the freedom and permission to experiment
 In the pilot episode, Kring suggested that a "fictional" cue be used in a scene in a burning car, played by Claire Bennett
 The "fictional" cue has since become an identity mark of the show

 On May 14, 2007, NBC announced that during the 2007–2008 season, the network would broadcast Heroes Origins, a sequel to the six-episode Heroes
 Each week a new character was to be introduced in the show and the audience had to choose who would be in the regular series of the next season
 The reason for airing this episode was stated to be a mid-season hiatus, due to which the ratings of Heroes faltered when they returned in the first season
 NBC President Kevin Raley told reporters on 14 May 2007, "we have something that i call a" big challenge "for the next year, which is trying to make our schedule more consistent for viewers
 We asked Tim Kring to tell us a plan and what i liked best is that not only do we have 30 hours of content for the next season but it will be a completely new suggestion that i think will show the show Will take you to the next level
 " The show was scheduled to air in April 2008 after the conclusion of the second season of Heroes, which was announced at the 2007 comic-con International
 The second season of Heroes and the first season of Heroes: Origins had a total of 30 episodes

 mujhe aashaa he ki kisi bindu par yah punah shuru hoga lekin abhi sirf prasaarit ho rahe sho ke vishay main hi jaankaree uplabdh he
" On 3 April 2008, Ben Silverman confirmed the cancellation of Origins, a day after NBC announced its prime time schedule
 The co-president of NBC Entertainment and Media Universal Studios said, "we were putting a lot of pressure on our creative team 


 We wanted thirty-five of Heroes and twelve episodes of Heroes: Origins, each with a short film and backdoor pilot As it was supposed to be

 Swami Haridas ji was a famous singer of music and a mentor of Tansen
 ek din praatavkaal swami ji dekhne lage ki unke bistar par koi razaai odhakar so rahaa hai
 Seeing this, Swamiji said - who are sleeping on my bed? vahaan shribihari ji swayan so rahe the
 On hearing the word, Bihari ran out
 kintu ve apane chuda evam vanshi, ko vistar par rakhkar chale gayi
 Swami ji, due to chronic vision in old age, he could not see anything
 iske pashchaat shri bankebihariji mandir ke pujari ne jab mandir ke kapaat khole to unhen shri bankevihariji mandir ke pujari ne jab mandir main kapat khole to unhen shribankebihari ji ke palane main chuda evam vanshi najar nahin aayi
 But the door of the temple was closed
 aashcharyachakit hokar pujari ji nidhivan main swami ji ke paas aaye evam swami ji ko sabhi baaten bataayi
 Swamiji said that someone had slept on my side in the morning
 wo jate vakt kuch chhod gaya hai
 Then the priest directly saw that Sibankebihari ji's wounds are lying on the wall
 isse pramanit hota he ki shribankebihari ji raat ko raas karne ke liye nidhivan jate hai
 For this reason, there is no mangla-aarti in the morning
 kaaran–raatri main raas karke yahaan bihari ji aate he
 Therefore, it is a crime to interrupt their sleep in the morning
 swami haridas ji ke darshan praapt karne ke liye anekon samraat yahan aate the

 shribankebihari ji ke darshan sambandh main anekon kahaniyaan prachlit hai
 One and two of which are the following - Once a devotee persuaded her husband to go to Vrindavan after much persuasion
 donon vrindavan aakar shribankebihari ji ke darshan karne lage
 After seeing Sribihari ji for a few days, when her husband tried to return to Swagriha, she started crying thinking that Sribihari ji would be deprived of the benefit of Darshan
 sansar bandhan ke liye swagrih jaayenge, isliye wo shribihari ji ke nikat rote–rote prarthana karne lagi ki– 'he prabhu main ghar ja rahi hun, kintu tum chirkaal mere hi paas nivas karnaa, aisa prarthana karne ke pashchaat ve donon railway stesan kii ore ghodagadee main baithkar chal diye
 At that time Sribankevihari ji, assuming the appearance of a cow boy, came behind the horse cart and started praying with devotion to take him along
 idhar pujari ne mandir main thakur ji ko na dekhakar unhone bhaktimati ke premayukt ghatana ko jaan liya evam tatkaal ve ghoda gaadi ke peeche daude
 The child in the car started praying to Sribakebihari ji
 donon main aisa vaartalap chalate samay wo balak unke madhya se gaayab ho gaya
 Then the priest returned to the temple and started seeing Sribakebihari Ji again
 idhar bhakt tathaa bhaktimati shribankebihari ji kii swayan krupa jaanakar donon ne sansar kaa gaman tyaag kar shribankebihari ji ke charnon main apane jivan ko samarpit kar diya
 For many such reasons, there are Jhalak Darshans of Shree Bankebihari ji
 shribihari ji mandir ke saamne ke daravaaje par ek pardaa laga rahata he or wo pardaa ek do minute ke antaraal par band evam kholaa jaataa hai or bhi kinvadanti hai
 Once a devotee kept watching that Sribakebihari ji ran away due to his devotion
 pujari ji ne jab mandir kii kapaat kholaa to unhen shribankebihari ji nahin dikhaai diye
 It is learned that he has gone to Aligarh to give testimony of one of his devotees
 tabhi se aisa niyam bana diya ki jhalak darshan main thakur ji kaa pardaa khulata evam band hota rahegaa

 ek samay unke darshan ke liye ek bhakt mahanubhav upasthit hue
 He kept staring at them for a long time
 rasik bankebihari ji un par riz gayi or unke saath hi unke gaanv main chale gayi
 Later, on discovering the Goswamis of Bihari ji, they followed him and after much persuasion and returning to Thakurji, came to Shrimandir
 isliye bihari ji ke jhaanki darshan kii vyavastha kii gai taaki koi unase najar na ladaa sake
 The unique thing here is that there is no Mangal Aarti here
 yahan ke gosaiyon kaa kahana he ki thakurji nity-raatri main raas main thakkar bhor main shayan karte hai
 At that time it is not appropriate to wake them up logon kii aasthaa itani he ki gat asina shukla panchami ko darshanath aaye bhakton main se ek jinhen aankhon se kuch nahin dikhataa tha,jigyaasa bas poocha baba aap dekhne main asamarth he, phir bhi bihari ji ke darshan hetu padhaare hai

 Ishwar Tyagi alias Langa and Keshav Upadhyay alias Keshu Firangi live like Sipahsalar near him
 film ke aarambhik drishy main langadaa tyaagi ek bas se bhari baraat rokkar rajju ko apni shaadi sthagit karne yaa omi dwaara daali mishra kii agavaai ko rokane kii chunauti detaa hai
 The rope reaches the in-laws house alone and reports Omi's leadership
 daali ke pita vakil raghunatha mishra, jise sabhi 'vakil saab' ke naam se jaanate hai, krodhavash apane aadamiyon ke saath omi ke thikaane pahonchte hai
 And threatening to release Dolly, firing a pistol at Omi's head
 lekin ain kshan main bhaisaab phonkaal dwaara donon ke bich tanaav todate hue vartmaan kii raajnneetik sthiti kaa hawala dekar khun-kharaba rokane ko kehete hai
 The next day Raghunath pressures Bhaisab to free his daughter
 lekin asal mudda daali ke apane pita ke samaksh hi khulata hai jab daali swechha se omi ko sweekaarti he or uske jabaran agavaai kii baat jhuthi tehraate he
 And the reasons for this decision give reasons one by one
 is baat se daali ke pita sharmindagi or vishwasghaat se tut jate he
 Here the director refers to the original composition 'othello' to make a twist in the plot, where Dolly's father explains to Omi 'bahubali! Do not forget the tricolor of the woman
 jo apane baap ko thag sakati he vah or kii sagi kya hogi ? Omi now employs or eradicates tactics like MMS sex scandel to prevent other rivals such as Indore Singh and Surendra Kaptan from participating in elections amid political conspiracies
 bhaisaab ab nirvirodh rup se loksabhaa ke vidhayak ban jate hai tathaa omi ko aagaamee lok chunaav main naye pratyaashee ke rup main chunaa jaataa hai
 And then Omi then declares Keshu as the new contender for the vacant post of the party's new 'bahubali', despite the lame's experience of all political activities
 omi ke shushk faisle se langadaa swayan ko apamaanit mahasoos karne saath keshu se irshyaa kar baithta he kyonki uske anusaar keshu anubhavheen ke saath gairjimmedaar bhi hai chaahe vah shikshit or yuvavarg main lokapriy hi kyon naa ho
 To avenge this insult, he lures him into drinking liquor on the basis of wishing Keshu good luck, due to which Keshu becomes furious and quarrels with the guests
 keshu kii karatuut omi ko maaloom pad jaati he jisase omi ko apane harek faisle par andeh hone lagata hai
 Here the lame one-handed asks Keshu to reconcile with Omi as Daly's old friendship, while in the other hand he tells Omi the concocted story of the suspicious relationship between Daly and Keshu
 isi bich omi kii ore se mili tohfe 'kamarband' ko daali anjaane main gum kar detii he jise indu apane yahaan chupa leti he
 When this thing is known to the lame, he puts many people in the circle of faith and mistrust through this waistband
 is bich tiwari bhaisahab par kichlu dwaara pranadhatak hamalaa hota he, jo usee ke virdohi indore singh kaa aadmi he
 Omi is determined to take revenge, so the lame now gives the same waistband Keshu a chance to find Kichalu through Billo Chamanbahar and kill him for getting the praise from Omi
 lekin yahaan bhi halaat keshu ke prati viparitt hi rahete hai kyonki langadaa yah kahkar omi ko bargalaata he ki daali kaa pahana kamarband keshu kii mashuka billo ke yahaan kaise pahunchaa ? kya daali ne jaanboojhkar kamarband keshu ko saunpi thi ? omi khinnata se ghar aakar daali se sawaal karata he par use swany gyaat nahin padataa ki omi uske saath rushth vyavhaar kyon kar rahaa he ? byaah ke kuch roj pehle tak omi or daali kaa prem ksheen padate dekh, indu omi ke ashankit man ko bhaanpate hue shaadi ko rokane or daali ko khud sanbhaalane kaa taana detii he
 In the meantime, Omi gets an order to kill Indore Singh on behalf of Bhagyahab along with the lame, after carrying out the work, Omi beats the same lame, saying that he should give evidence of suspiciousness between Dolly and Keshu, otherwise the case is proved to be false Lose your life shaadi kii raat omi kii sabhi galatfahami ko langadaa apni kuchaalon se pushti kar detaa he ki daali or keshu ke bich vaaki avaidh rishte hai
 Omi, angry with this false infidelity, brutally kills Dolly in his own honeymoon, while the lame shoots Keshu on Omi's orders with his gun
 dhamaake ke aawaaj se dari hooi indu omi ke kamare ghus daali ko mrit paakar hairaan pad jaati he
 But at the same time, Indu says to Kamarband that he had stolen it
 ab donon ko samaj aati hai ki in sabhi ke jimmvari kaa kaaran langadaa hi hai jisane apane kuteel chaalon main sabko gumraah rakhaa
 Anguished by the confidant and devastation, Indu cuts her husband's limp's neck with light, while faking herself and Omi, helpless, commits suicide as soon as the injured Keshu arrives
 antim drushay main asahaay keshu jhule jhulate nishpraan daali or neeche pade mrit omi ko dekhtaa he

 R
 Austrico had discovered some time before 1900 that heating the Kathkoyle to red hot in a stream of steam greatly increases the exploitation power of the Kathkoyle
 aise kathkoyale ko sakriyakrut kathkoyala kehete hai
 After 1916, the rituals of making activated Kathkoya were invented
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke gas mascon ke liye adhik sakriyakrut kathkoyale kii aavashyaktaa padi
 Researches then found out that by heating the coal of stone to a particular temperature and passing steam on it, one could get good activated coal cheaply

 isi tarah akshar char kaa pataa sangrakshit karne ke liye char* datatype kaa upyog karte hai
 a small example is given below in which one variable preserves the address of another variable
 yahan pehle ek purnank char x paribhaashit kiya gaya he, phir p aisa char paribhaashit kiya he jo kisi purnank kaa pataa sangrakshit karata he
 Then put the address of x in the p variable
 pataa → 0 1 2 3 4memory → 1 xxrep 4 0 111 11100101 00100110 xxrep 4 0 101 01100101 
 
 
 ↑ p = &x = 3 int x ab char ek purnank pointer p he jisamen char x kaa pataa sangrakshit he arthath p ko likhavane par x kaa pataa likhaa jaayegaa
 If we want to know what memory is written in p on that memory, then we must write a main function to use * p
 kyonki ’si’ compiler kisi bhi program ko nishpadit karnaa main function se aarambh karata he
 a file or a program cannot have more than one main function
 yah ek prayogkarta dwaara paribhaashit function he
 The main function is initialized by brackets '{'
 program sanchika ke nishpaadan ke samay ’{’ yah bataata he ki nishpaadan yahan se aarambh karnaa he
 Similarly '}' tells that execution is to end here
 ek program main main function to ek hi rahata he parantu anya function kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 a subprogram is given between {and} for each function
 prayek nirdesh kaa ant semikalan ’;’ dwaara hona aavashyak he
 On running this program, its output will be as follows: ek anya udhaaharan 133 to 135 ° C, expression error: unknown word "to"
 K, expressant truti: agyaat shabd "to"
 ° f uria ek carbonic yogic he jiskaa rasinic sutara 2CO hota he
 In the field of organic chemistry, it is also called carbamide
 yah ek rangahin, gandhhin, safed, ravedaar jaharila thos padaarth he
 This is most soluble in water
 yah stanpayi or sarisrup praaniyon ke mutr main paaya jaataa he
 It is used as a nitrogenous chemical fertilizer in agriculture
 uria ko sarvapratham 1773 main mutr main french vaigyanik hillari roule ne khoja tha parantu kritrim vidhi se sabase pehle uria banane kaa shrey german vaigyanik vohalar ko jaataa he
 He made urea from silver isocyanate and wrote a letter from Swedish scientist Bergelius that i have made urea artificially without the help of kidney
 us samay puri duniya main barjelius kaa siddhanth mana jaataa tha ki uria jaise carbonic yogic sajivon ke sharir ke baahar ban hi nahin sakate tathaa inako banane ke liye praan shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Urea is produced on a large scale by the reaction of liquid ammonia and liquid carbon dioxide
 uria kaa upyog mitti kii urvara shakti badhaane main hota he
 It is also used as a pollution control vehicle
 uria-farmaldihide, rengine, plastic evam hydragin banane main iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This makes black-jar medicine called urea-stibamine
 veronal naamak neend kii dawa banane main uskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 It is also used in the manufacture of drugs used as sedatives
 saal 2008-2009 main bharat main uria kaa utpaadan kareeb do karod ton rahaa tha jabaki vaastavik khapat kareeb 2
4 karod ton thi
 The additional requirement of 4 million tonnes was met through import of urea
 lekin gharelu urvarak companiyaan agle chaar saal main apni uria utpaadan kshamta ko badhaane par paanch se chah arab dollar kaa nivesh kar sakati hai, jisase desh kii uria utpaadan kshamta main 60 lakh ton kii badhotaree hone kaa anumaan he
 With the expansion of urea production capacity, India will turn into an exporting country rather than an urea importer
 vishwa falak par aaj vigyaapan kaa jo bahuaiami swarup viksit hua he, uske peeche vigyaapan kii ek lambii kahani he
 Its background is embedded in the ancient history of the world
