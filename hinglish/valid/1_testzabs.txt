 visheshtaon main shaamil hai: War between two opposing persons or parties, according to predetermined and well-known rules, is called duel by the prevailing weapons
 aise yuddh pracheen kaal main bahut se deshon main prachlit the
 At the core of their practice was the belief that in these wars, God wins only those in whose favor justice is done
 bharat main aise yuddh dharmayuddh samajhe jate the
 Duel battles were prevalent in the Vedic period
 uttar vaidic kaal main inke sambandh main nae niyam banaakar purvaprachlit pratha main sudhaar kiya gaya
 There are many references to duel in Ramayana and Mahabharata
 ram ravan, baali sugriv tathaa duryodhana or bhim ke yuddh iske udhaaharan hai
 In the later period also, these wars had a considerable trend
 kshatriyon ke bich jo baaten anya prakaar se nahin sulajhaai ja sakati thim unke nirnay ke liye yah reeti apanaai jaati thi
 It was often the case that when two kings stood face to face with an army for war, in order to save bloodshed it was decided that one of the opposing armies, or in equal numbers, would fight the crusade and The warriors of the side should be considered victorious
 kabhi kabhi sainikon ko na ladaakar ek raja vaa senapati duusare ko yuddh ke liye lalkaarta or is jode kii haar jeet se rajyon ke jhagade kaa nipataara ho jaataa tha
 This practice was prevalent among the Hindu kings of South India till a few hundred years ago
 anya deshon main bhi dwandvayuddh kaa prachlan isi vishwaas ke kaaran hua ki yah ishwariya nyaay kii reeti he, kintu japan se arayaland tak tathaa bumadhyasaagar se uttari akshanshon tak kisi na kisi rup main sweekrut hote hue bhi yah sarvatra prachlit nahin tha
 According to the ancient pundits of Europe, the judgment of David and Goliath described in the Bible was divinely approved
 is aadhaar par dwandvayudhon kaa auchity madhyayug main sweekaar kiya jaataa tha
 The origin of the early duel in Europe from the earliest times is not well known, but the detailed methods edited at the beginning of this famous war by Menelius and Paris described in the Iliad are the etiquette practices and ancient practices of this relationship prevalent during the time of the Greek poet Homer
 The customs are revealed
 dwandvayuddh kii pratha kaa prachlan pracheen italy main ambria pradesh ke nivaasiyon tathaa slav jatiyon main bhi hone ke pramaan milte hai
 But it was not practiced in the state of Rome, but the Romans considered it the practice of uncivilized people
 parantu is kaal main bhi prasiddh roman senapati, sipio afracanas ne isa purv 203 main is spain main prachlit paaya tha
 It was also practiced among the ancient Germanic castes
 jin samrik paramparaon se europe main samantvaad tathaa shur veeron ke yug kaa vikaas hua unheen ke kaaran, roman samrajya ke patan ke pashchaat, dwandvayuddh ne bhi samast europe main san 814 se 840 tak samrajya sthapit karanevaale lui l debonaire ke rajya main yadi koi kisi par dosha lagaataa or prativaadee use asweekrut karata to nyaayadhish dwandvayuddh kii ajna detaa tha
 There is no doubt that at the core of the spirit of the duel was a personal reputation based on courage and a sense of honor
 yadi lalakaara hua vyakti yuddh karnaa sweekaar nahin karata tha to vah kaayar tathaa hin samajha jaataa tha
 In Europe until mid-16th century, the practice of justice from duel was generally legal
 simit kshetron main khadey hokar ye yuddh lade jate the tathaa nishchit vidhiyon or kade niyamon se bandhe hote the
 According to a popular law, the man who was challenged was the right to choose weapons
 ek anya niyamanusaar kisi prakaar ke jaadu tone kii, athwa mitron tathaa darshakon se kisi prakaar kii, sahaayta varjit thi
 Although the term duality is used in this type of war, even in India like Europe, there were sometimes many humans on each side of the war
 is prakaar ek yuddh san 1396 main scotland kii ke or chaten jatiyon main, raja robert tisare ke sammukh hua tha
 In this, 30 warriors from each side fought as long as only 10 humans survived on one side
 france main henry dwitiya ne san 1547 main, raja yaa nyaayadhikari ke sammukh honevaale nyaayik dwandvayuddh band kara die
 As a result of this, the practice of personal duel and fighting till death was followed
 aise yudhon main ladanevaalon ke saath do yaa adhik mitra bhi yah dekhne ke liye rahete the ki koi aniyamitata yaa anyaay na hone paae
 In 1578, a duel broke out between the beloved deity of the King of France, Kellus, and the duchess of the Geez at the Sier de Dunes
 isaki prishthbhumi raajnneetik hone ke kaaran donon ore se jo mitra nireekshak haakar aae the unamem bhi aapas main yuddh than gaya
 As a result, two of these friends lived in the fields
 ek kii mrityu baad main hui tathaa chauthaa gambhir rup se aahat hua
 The incident also gave rise to the practice of inspectors participating in the duel, which continued for nearly 75 years, across Europe
 16veen or 17veen shatiyon main europe ke adhikansh deshon main dwandvayuddh ke virodh main anek kanoon banaae gaye, kintu lalakaare jane par yuddh se mukh modana kaayarta samajha jaataa tha, samaaj main aise yudhon kaa bahu prachlan ho gaya tha tathaa kendriya rajshakti simit hoti thi
 For these reasons, they could not be stopped
 kintu san 1643 main lui 14wein ke france ke singhaasana par arudh hone par avasthaa badal gai, kyonki usne aise yudhon main bhaag lenevaalon ke liye mrityudand niyat kar diya tha
 This kind of war stopped basically, but they continued in another form
 dwandvayuddh ke icchhuk us samay prachlit choti talavaaron ko lekar bina kisi ko jataae, kisi sunsaan sthaan main akele bhid jate the or yadi inamen se koi maaraa jaataa to kanoon se bachane ke liye doosraa yah kahkar apni jaan bachaa letaa ki yah krity aatmaraksha main hua he
 But when the killings started under the guise of this custom, the duel in the deserted place stopped and the practice of the inspectors started again, but they themselves did not fight
 19veen shatee tak talavaaron se ladane kaa chalan tha
 Till then, it was necessary to strictly follow the rules in these wars and as soon as there was bloodshed in France, the war was stopped
 is prakaar in yudhon main vishesh haani kii sambhaavna nahin rah gai
 At this time and later, there was a trend of duel warfare among the students of Germany with a special type of sword, but it used the means of body defense, such as armor, etc
, and even if it was wound, it was usually subordinate
 in yudhon main pistolon kaa prayog 18veen shatee ke madhya se aarambh hua
 From the beginning, it was customary that a mounted opponent armed with a sword and a dagger, holding a loaded pistol in hand, pounced on each other and fired pistols at each other while passing by
 yadi donon yoddha jivit batch jate to lautakar ve talwaar or khanjar se yuddh karte the
 By the year 1780, it was well-known to fight duel with pistols by standing on the ground and special types of pistols were being made for this purpose
 england main is prakaar ke yuddh kaa sarvaadhik prachlan jorge chaturth ke rajyakaal main hua, jab wellington ke duk, lord vincilsee, landondery ke marquis tathaa prasiddh banke jawan, bo bramel, bhi dwandvayuddh ke kshetra main utre the
 The number of casualties in such wars is estimated from an article written in 1836, according to the author, in which more than two hundred registered duel of pistols, one out of every six humans was injured and one out of every 13 humans died on
 is prakaar ke yudhon ke dushprayog tathaa dushprinaam samajhadaar logon ke sanmukh dirghakaal se spasht ho rahe the
 In various countries of Europe, a rule was made to stop them, to remove the criminals of the duel
 iskaa prabhaav yah hua ki englad ke sainik tathaa asainik donon prakaar ke nagarikon main iskaa chalan band ho gaya
 In 1850, this practice arose from almost all other countries
 pataal kaa dwaar turkmenistan ke aakhaal praant ke derveze gaanv main ek prakritik gas kaa kshetra he
 Here the gas coming out of a big hole in the ground has been burning continuously since 1971

 In 1971, when Turkmenistan was part of the Soviet Union, some Soviet geologists excavated here and reached a large gas-filled cave below
 yahan pahonchte hi gupha kii chat gir gai or unka sara khudaai kaa saaman usamen ja gira
 Here a 70 meter big hole opened and poisonous gas started to rise from outside, which became the life of the surrounding villagers
 is zahreele risaav ko rokane ke liye unhone gas main aag laga di
 They had estimated that the gas would burn out in a few days, but this fire is still burning after decades

04 The capital of Kerala is Pampa at a distance of 175 km from Thiruvananthapuram and four to five km from there lies the Shabarimala temple at an altitude of about 1000 meters above sea level, amidst the dense forests of the Sahyaparvat ranges from the Western Ghats
 makka-madina ke baad yah duniya kaa doosraa sabase bada tirth mana jaataa he, jahaan har saal karodon kii sankhya main shraddhalu aate hai
 Shabarimala is a wonderful link between Shaiva and Vaishnavas

 This route is five kilometers long
 kamb ramayana, mahabhagwat ke ashtum skandh or skandapurana ke asur cond main jis shishu shasta kaa zikr he, ayppan usee ke avatar maane jate hai
 It is said that Shasta was born to the consort of Mohini Veshadhari Vishnu and Shiva
 unheen ayppan kaa mashhoor mandir punakvan ke naam se vikhyath 18 pahadiyon ke bich sthit is dham main he, jise sabarimala shridharmashashtha mandir kaha jaataa he
 It is also believed that Parashurama installed the idol at Sabarimala for Ayyappan worship
 kuch log ise rambhakt shabari ke naam se jodakar bhi dekhte hai
 Some people say that about 700-800 years ago, there was a lot of disharmony between Shaivites and Vaishnavas in the south
 tab un matbhedon ko dur karne ke liye shri ayppan kii pariklpana kii gai
 This dharmatirtha was developed to coordinate both
 aaj bhi yah mandir samanvay or sadbhaav kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Here people from any caste-fraternity and any religion can come
 panpa pahunchakar hamane paidal hi sabarimala tak kii yatra karne kaa faisla kiya
 This path is inaccessible, but the feeling of being among nature makes the mind ready to take such a risk
 makar sankranti or uttara phalguni nakshatra ke sanyog ke din, panchami tithi or vrishchik lagn ke sanyog ke samay hi shri ayppan kaa janm mana jaataa he
 That is why the festival is celebrated in the Dharmashastha temple on the day of Makar Sankranti
 ham makar sankranti ke din hi vahaan pahunche
 This temple is not only beautiful in terms of architecture, it also has a strange feeling of peace
 jis tarah yah 18 pahadiyon ke bich sthit he, usee tarah mandir ke praangan main pahunchane ke liye bhi 18 sidhiyaan paar kerani padati hai

 Consider one more thing here
 yahaan zyaadaatar purush bhakt maujuud the
 Female devotees were few
 agar thim bhi, to budhi auraten
 When asked about this by a priest of the temple, it came to know that Sri Ayyappan was a Brahmachari
 isliye yahaan ve choti bacchiyaan aa sakati hai, jo rajaswala na hui hon yaa budhi auraten, jo isse mukt ho chuki hai
 Despite not accepting the bond of caste-religion, this bond is to be followed by the devotees
 baaki, dharm nirpekshata kii adbhut misaal yah dekhne ko milti he ki yahaan se kuch hi duuri par erumeli naamak jagah par shri ayppan ke sahyogi maane jane vaale muslim dharmanuai vaavar kaa makbara bhi he, jahaan mattha teke bina yahaan kii yatra puri nahin maani jaati
 Apart from the coordination of two votes, a unique form of religious tolerance was seen here
 dharm insaan ko vyapak najariya detaa he, isaki bhi pushti hui
 In the broad sense that if there is true faith in the mind, then the distinction between the devotee and God is erased
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki agar koi vyakti tulsi yaa rudraksh kii maala pahanakar, vrath rakhkar, sir par naivedhy se bhari potli lekar yahaan pahunche, to uski manokamana jarur puri hoti he
 On wearing the garland, the devotee starts being called Swami and then there is no distinction between God and the devotee
 vaise shri dharmashashtha mandir main log jatthon main aate hai
 The person who leads the batch, Iramudi is in his hands
 pehle paidal milon yatra karne vaale log apane saath khaane-pine kii vasteen bhi potliyon main lekar chalate the
 This was the custom of pilgrimage
 ab aisa nahin
 But devotion is the same

 vishesh rup se clock tower, jo apni mukhya ghante ke kaaran big ben ke rup main janaa jane laga he, landan kaa pratishthit aitihaasik sthal or shahar kaa mukhya paryaton centre he
 It is also called a symbol of parliamentary democracy
 1970 se hi pales of westominster ucchkoti kii imaarat maani jaati he or 1987 se yah unesco ke vishwa dharohar sthalon kaa hissaa he
 The Palace of Westminster was also diplomatically important because of its position during the Middle Ages as it was built on the banks of the River Thames
 madhyakaal main throni island ke naam se mashhoor is jagah ko 1016 se 1035 main canut da great ne apana shahi mahal banaaya hua tha
 St
 Edward the Confessor built a royal palace on Throny Island before the end of King Saxon of England
 It was west of the city of London
 ise thik usee samay banaaya gaya tha jab usne westominster abi banwaaya tha
 Throny Island and the area around it soon came to be known as Westminster
 in imaaraton kaa upyog naa to sackson ne kiya or naa hi wiliam pratham ne
 The part of the palace that lasted the longest period was from William 1 to the time of King William 2
 madhya kaal ke ant tak pales of westominster shaasha kaa mukhya grih tha
 The curia regis used to congregate in the Westminster Hall in the same place as the earlier draft of Parliament
 england kii pehali adhikarik sansad da model parliament kii baithak is mahal main 1295 main hui
 lagbhag iske baad kii sabhi sansad vahaan par sabha kar chuki he
 In 1530 King Henry VIII seized York Place from Cardinal Thomas Wolsey
 vah ek shaktishaalee mantri tha jisane apane raja kaa samarthan kho diya tha
 Henry named it the Palace of Whitehall and made it his main home
 yadhyapi westominster aadhikarik taur par shahi mahal hi rahaa
 It was used by both the Houses of Parliament and the Royal Courts
 kyonki vastav main yah ek shahi grih tha, isliye yahaan par donon sadanon ke kisi anya kaary ke liye koi kaksh nahin banaaya gaya tha
 The main festivals of the state were celebrated in painted rooms
 house of lords kii baithak vastav main rani ke kaksh main hoti thi
 This elegant hall was located at the south end of the building which was built in the medieval period
 1801 main ucch sadan bade safed kaksh main sthanantarit ho gaya
 It used to be in the Court of Request before
 jise 18 veen shatabdi main raja jorge tritiy ne banwaaya tha
 At the same time there was a treaty with Ireland
 yah kadam isliye uthaaya gaya kyon ki purv kaksh main bade hue mitra samooh ke liye jagah nahin thi
 The House of Commons had no chamber of its own, its meetings were sometimes held in the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey
 kamans ne pales main stephen chapel ke rup main apane liye ek sthai jagah bana lee
 Stephen's Chapel was the former chapel of the Royal Palace during the reign of Edward VI
 1547 main yah imaarat kamans ke istemaal ke liye uplabdh ho gayi
 St Stephen's College had to be disbanded for this
 agali teen shatabdiyon main stifan ke chapel main kai badlaav kiye gayi, taaki nichle sadan kii suvidha barkaraar rahe
 Then immediately, his form of medievalism was completely destroyed
 kyonki sansad ko apane simit jagah me kaary karne main pareshaani ho rahi thi isliye pales of westominster main 18 veen shatabdi ke baad se kai prakaar ke parivartan kiye gayi
 The talk of building an entirely new palace was ignored, instead new buildings were added to it
 a new western main gate was built between 1755 and 1770
 yah darwaja saint margaret street kii ore khulata tha
 It was built in the Padalian style
 ab saamudayik kaksh evam sangrakshan ke liye kaaphi jagah ho gayi thi
 In 1795 a new official residence was built for the Speaker of the House of Commons
 yah saint stephen chapel ke saath sata hua tha
 Between 1799 and 1801 the new Gothic craftsman James Wyatt started his work in both the Houses, the House of Lords and the House of Commons
 1824 or 1827 ke bich mahal kii puri imaarat ko ek baar phir se banaaya gaya
 And this time Sir John Son did it
 madhya kaaleen house of laders kaa chembar jo ki 1650 main gan powder plot ke fail hone par nishaanaa bana tha
 He was devastated to carry out this renovation work
 taaki is jagah ke dakshin sire par ek nayaa shahi galiyara or bhavy pravesh dwaar banaaya ja sake
 The tasks that Son did in the palace included the new facility of the library for both the houses of Parliament and the new law room for the king's law bench and the high court
 son dwaara kii nayi kalatmak shilpkaaree ko lekar kai virodhabhas bhi uthne shuru ho gayi
 Those who supported the Gothic art of the original building became opposed to it
 16 oktober 1834 ko pales main aag lag gai jab lathi bhandar main rakhe aag ke stove ke atyadhik tap jane ke kaaran house of laders ke kaksh ne aag pakad lee
 iske parinaam swaroop sansad ke dono sadan nasht ho gayi or aas paas kii anya imaaraten bhi nahin bachiin
 aag bachaav dal kii sartakta ke kaaran or hawa kii disha ke anukool hone kii vajah se westominster haul batch gaya
 The Jewel Tower, the Under Craft Chapel, the Cloisters and the Chapter House of St
 Stephen's are the other parts of the palace that survived the disaster
 aag lagane ke turant baad hi raja wiliam IV ne apana buckingham pales sansad ko dene kii peshkash kii, jo banakar lagbhag taiyaar ho chukaa tha
 The reason behind this was also that he did not like her as his place of residence
 is imaarat ko sansad ke kaary ke liye upyukt nahin paaya gaya
 Therefore the offer was rejected
 charing cars or james park par bhi vichaar nahin ban paaya
 Historical and political connections to Wesminster proved powerful for the transfer
 jabaki vahaan kai kamiyaan thim
 Now priority was being given that Parliament should get its place as soon as possible
 isliye house of lard tathaa house of kamans ke liye jaldi main chitrakala vaale kaksh or safed kaksh ko taiyaar kiya gaya
 The direction for this was done by the remaining craftsman of the Board of Works, Sir Robert Smirk
 farvari 1835 sadan chalaane ke liye kaksh taiyaar karne kaa kaam jaldi jaldi kiya gaya
 a royal organization appointed to study the new structure of the palace, its proposed style was also debated among the people
 ab yah nai uttam padyati jo ki sanyukt rajya ke fedral capital or white house jaisi thi, us samay kaaphi prachlit hui
 yah style pehle son dwaara puraane mahal ke kuch hisse main bhi istemaal kii ja chuki thi
 It had signs of revolution and republic in the new format
 jabaki gothic sanrachana main sangrakshan ke mulya ke mulya chhipe the
 In 1835, this commission had announced that the format of this building would be either Gothic or Elizabethan
 This royal commission asked all architects to plan with this view
 1836 main 97 paraspar virdohi yojanayen padhane ke baad shahi ayog ne gothic style kaa mahal banane ke liye bairi kii yojana ko chunaa
 isaki neenv to 1840 main hi daal di gai thi
 Lord's Room was completed in 1847 and Commons' Room in 1852
 Although 1860 employees were engaged for this work, this work could not be completed for a decade
 bairi jisaki apni shilpakala gothic kam or panrparik zyada he
 He built this new palace on the basis of new rules of balance
 He relied on Augustus Pugin for interior decoration and grand construction
 Which included wall decoration, carving work, tile work, furniture etc
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke dauraan jab germany ne landan par bambaari kii thi tab alag alag avasar par chaudaa baar pales of westominster bhi is bambaari kaa shikaar hua tha
 On 26 September 1940, a bomb was dropped in the old palace
 is bambaari main saint stifan porch kii dakshini diwaar nasht ho gayi thi or saath hi iskaa pashchimi mukhadwar bhi nasht ho gaya tha
 The statue of The Loin Richard had also risen somewhat from its place due to this powerful explosion and the sword raised above it fell
 is pratimaa ko loktantr ke pratik ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 It is said that "in the event of an attack, even if you bow down a little, it will not break"
 a second bomb that fell on 8 December destroyed many monasteries
 10 / 11 may 1941 ko sabase zyada khatarnaak hamalaa hua tha, tab pales ko kam se kam 12 jatke lage the or teen logon kii mrityu ho gai thi
 a fiery bomb hit the chamber of the House of Commons and set fire to it
 The second bomb rocked the roof of Westminster Hall
 The fire rescue team could not save both and it was decided that at least work should be done to keep Andal Hall safe
 These people were successful in this task
 lekin comons kaksh puri tarah se nasht ho chukaa tha or sadsy lobby bhi nahin bachi thi
 a bomb also fell into the lord's chamber, but went off without a break on the ground
 yaa to koi chota bam upar clock tower se takaraayaa tha yaa phir koi vimaan bhedi chat ke chajje par gira tha
 Due to which the roof was severely damaged
 ghadi kaa sheesha puri tarah se nasht ho chukaa tha
 But its hands and bell were still working and even now this big watch was telling the right time
 kamans chembar ke nasht hone ke baad, lard ne swayan kaa vaad vivaad kaksh kamans ke istemaal ke liye de diya 
 or lard ke swayan ke istemaal ke liye quins robing room ko kuch samay apane prayog main laane ke liye lard ne rakh liya
 After the war the Commons Room was remodeled under the direction of the craftsman Sir Giles Gilbert Scott
 is baar yah bahut hi saadhaaran puraane kaksh kii style main banaaya gaya
 This work ended in 1950
 ab donon sadanon ko apana apana kaksh mil gaya
 Now the need for office space began to increase and the Parliament acquired some space in the nearby Norman Shaw building in 1975

 With this increase, there is space for all mps to create their own offices

 But he was assisted by the Gothic craftsman Augustus Pugin
 gyarahavi shatabdi main bana westominster haul jo 1834 kii aagjanee ko jhel chukaa he
 This hall was designed by Barry
 pugin is kaam ke nattejey se khush nahin the
 He was mainly dissatisfied with the design plan devised by Barry
 unhonen iske liye ye tippanee bhi kii thi ki sabhi gracian, sar, yah paaramparik imaarat par tuder style kaa vivaran he"
 The stonework done on this building was actually Anston
 yah ek baaluu ke rang kaa magangian limestone he
 Whose mine is in Anston village in South Yorkshire
 yah pathar halaki pradooshan or duusare istemaal ho rahe kam gunvattta vaale pattharon ke kaaran jaldi hi kharaab hone laga
 yadhyapi yah sab kharabiyaan jald se jald 1849 tak thik kar lee gayi thim or iske baad 19 veen shatabdi main kuch nahin kiya gaya tha
 During 1900, one thing was very clear that some work of stone carving would have to be changed now
 
 The project was started in 1930, but due to the Second World War, its work stopped and it was finished in 1950 itself
 1960 tak pradooshan ab phir se prabhavi hone laga
 1981 main towers or bahari unnayan ke pattharon ke sangrakshan kii ek yojana shuru hui

 At the southern end of this palace is a very famous tower known as the Clock Tower, it is also known as Big Ben
 yah 96
3 meter ke victoria tower se thodaa hi chota he lekin bahut hi patala he
 It has a large clock in Westminster
 jise ki edward jon dent ne banaaya tha or iskaa dizin shaukia horologist edmund backet denisan ne taiyaar kiya tha
 In a moment, its bells ring completely, the specialty of this big watch is that its timing is absolutely accurate, which the 19th century watchmakers considered difficult
 or 1859 se jab se yah astitv main ai he is par bharosa kaayam he
 Its time is measured in diameter by four dials 7 meters, which are made of milky colored glass and at night it shines from behind
 iskaa ghante vaala haath 2

3 meter chota he
 Five bells hang in the clock on the top of the house
 chaar chaturthaansh ghantiyaan westominster ke ghantanad ko har ghante ke har chauthe bhaag main bajaati rahati hai
 The biggest bell when the bell rings is called the Great Bell of Westminster in official language
 saamanyata ise bigaben bhi kehete hai
 Which is the name given to uncertain origins, this name started to be used for the tower over time
 The first bell, which was given this name, broke during testing and it was then re-molded
 There is a rift in the vine that is in front of us today
 jiske kaaran isaki dhwani bhi kuch alag ho gayi he
 If seen, its weight is 13
8 tonnes, the third largest clock in Britain
 The lantern that is placed at the top of the clock tower is the Ayrton light, it only burns when the assembly of the rough house of Parliament continues even after dark

 He was in charge of ventilation of the new Parliament House
 inaki yojana ke anusaari hi pales ke madhya main ek badi chimney banaai gai thi
 For which they had said that the polluted and hot air generated by the fire burning from all four sides of the palace will come out through this chimney
 In order to replace the tower, it was emphasized to Barry that he planned the high roof of the lobby
 un chhaton ko nicha hi rakhaa jaye
 or isaki khidakiyon kii oochai ko bhi kam kiya jaye
 halaki yah stambh bhi mahal kii bahari sanrachana ke liye ek acha mauka sabit hua
 Barry had conceived the design of a tower for this so that these large pillars could be balanced
 Eventually, the central tower completely failed in its purpose
 But this work was worth noting because it was the first time mechanical services were directly impacting the craft
 shikhar choote kangure jo khidakiyon ke baade ke bich tathaa mahal ke saamne se uthte hue upar kii ore ja rahe hai, yah aakash ke kshitij se lagati imaarat ko sajiv banaate hai
 Like the central tower, it is also connected for some practical reasons, it also makes way for the movement of light

 systoscopy mutrmarg ke madhyam se kii jane vaali, mutrashay kii endoscopy he
 This is done with the aid of a cystoscope
 naidanik systoscopy sthaneey anaesthesia ke saath kii jaati he
 Extensive anesthesia is sometimes given for the surgical cystoscopy procedure
 mutrmarg vah nalee he jo mutr ko mutrashay se sharir ke baahar le jaati he
 The cystoscope has lenses like the telescope or microscope
 ye lens chikitsak ko mutrmarg kii aatanrik satahon par focus karne kii suvidha pradaan karte hai
 Some cystoscopes use optical fibers that display the image from the front of the instrument to the viewing piece at the other end
 systoscope ek pencil kii motaai se lekar 9 mili meter tak mote hote hai tathaa inke agrabhag par prakaash strot hota he
 Many cystoscopes also have a few extra ducts that guide the instruments needed for surgical procedures to treat urinary problems
 systoscopy do prakaar kii hoti hai - flexible tathaa rigid - yah systoscope ke lacheelepan ke antar par aadhaarit hoti he
 Flexible cystoscopy is performed with the help of local anesthesia in both sexes
 aamtaur par, anaesthetic ke rup main ziloken jail kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, ise mutrmarg main daalaa jaataa he
 Rigid cystoscopy can also be performed under similar conditions, but in general it is done by giving extensive anesthesia, especially in male patients due to the discomfort of probes
 ek doctor nimnlikhit sthitiyon main systoscopy kii salaah de saktaa he: If there is any upward stones stuck in the patient's urethra, the doctor can use a thinner scope to reach the ureters through the bladder, this instrument is called a ureteroscope
 
chikitsak us pathari ko dekh kar use hataa kar ek taar ke chor par lagi choti si daliya ke dwaara nikaal saktaa he, jise urateroscope main ek atirikt nalee ke dwaara daalaa jaataa he
 For larger stones, the physician breaks down the stone into smaller pieces with a flexible filament, which contains the laser beam, in the ureteroscope, which is then passed out of the body by urine
 haalanki chikitsak vishesh nirdesh dete hai, parantu adhikansh maamalon main, mariz pareekshan ke baad saamaanya rup se bhojan tathaa apni dainik gatividhiyaan kar sakate hai
 Patients are sometimes asked to give a urine sample before testing so that an infection can be detected in it
 in marijon ko yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki ve ek paryaapt avadhi tak mutr tyaag na karen, jisase ki ve pareekshan se pehle is samay mutr tyaag kar saken
 Patients are required to remove clothing covering the lower part of their body, although some physicians prefer that patients wear a hospital gown and cover their lower body with sterilized veils
 Mostly, the patient has to lie on their back and stretch their knees
 kabhi kabhi, mariz ko apane ghutane uthaane bhi pad sakate hai
 This is particularly so when it is undergoing rigorous cystoscopy
 flexible systoscopy prakriya ke dauraan mariz lagbhag hameshaa sachet rahata he or uske ksht ko kam karne ke liye sthaneey anaesthesia kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 In cases that require rigid cystoscopy, it is not uncommon for the patient to have extensive anesthesia, as this may be more painful, especially in male patients
 ek doctor, nurse yaa takanisian mutradwar ke aasapaas kaa kshetra saafe karke sthaneey anaesthesia lagaataa he
 Local anesthesia can be applied directly from the tube or with the help of a needle syringe
 aksar, twachaa kii taiyaari hibeten kii sahaayta se kii jaati he
 Spinal or extensive anesthesia is used on patients who need to have a ureteroscopy
 chikitsak systoscope ke agrabhag ko dhire se mutrmarg main pravesh kara kar ise disha nirdeshit karte hue mutrashay tak le jate hai
 This whole process is more painful in men than women because the male urethra is longer and narrower
 shroni kshetra kii mansapeshiyon ko shithil karne se pareekshan ke is bhaag ko saral banaaya ja saktaa he
 a sterile fluid is circulated through the cystoscope to slowly fill the bladder and then spread it to give the physician a better view of the bladder walls
 jab mutrashay apni kshamta tak bharne lagata he tab marijon ko vishisht rup se asuvidha hoti he tathaa mutratyag kii ichha hone lagati he
 The time from inserting the cystoscope to removal is only a few minutes, but if the doctor finds a stone there or in cases where a biopsy is needed, the time may be longer
 biopsy lene kii kriya is prakriya ko lambi kar sakati he
 In most cases, the entire test, including preparation, takes about 15 to 20 minutes
 pareekshan ke baad, aksar rogiyon ko mutratyag ke samay jalan mahasoos hoti he tathaa aksar unhen mutr main alp maatra main rakt bhi dikhaai padataa he
 Urinary incontinence and leakage as a result of procedures performed using rigid devices are caused by damage to the urethra for unknown reasons
 kabhi kabhi, marijon ke pet ke nichle bhaag main dard hota he, jo mutrashay kii mansapeshiyon kii anthan ko darshata he, parantu yah aamtaur se nahin hota he
 Medical instructions to avoid post-test complications usually include: kuch chikitsak sankraman se bachaane ke liye 1 yaa 2 dinon tak antibiotic lene kii salaah dete hai
 However, recent trends discourage such preservative treatments as these increase the rate of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics
 chikitsak marijon ko jalan se bachaane ke liye pyridium 200 milligram lene kii salaah dete hai

 Fuel tax can work as an incentive for more efficient production, so for lower pollution, car design and development of alternative fuels
 High fuel tax encourages buyers to make lighter, smaller and more fuel efficient cars, Or do not run a Fee car
 Generally, today's automobile can be rebuilt 75 percent and using recycled steel we can use the car to reduce energy usage and pollution
 In the United States, Congress made Faderahalli mandatory fuel efficiency, which was regularly debated, although passenger car standards could not be improved more than what the standard was made in 1985
 Light truck standards have also changed very quickly and were reported in 2007

 naanaa sahib san 1857 ke bhartiya swatantrata ke pratham sangram ke shilpkaar the
 His original name was 'dhondupant'
 swatantraaa sangram main naanaa sahib ne kanpur main angrejon ke viruddh vidrohiyon kaa netritv kiya
 
 naanaa sahab ne san 1824 main venugram nivasee madhavnarayan raav ke ghar janm liya tha
 His father Peshwa was the real brother of Bajirao II
 peshwa ne balak nanarav ko apana dattak putr sweekaar kiya or unki shiksha diksha kaa yathesht prabandh kiya
 He was taught the method of riding elephants, swords and guns and also made good knowledge of many languages
 28 janvari san 1851 ko peshwa kaa swargvaas ho gaya
 Nanarao cremated the Peshwa with great pride
 divangat peshwa ke uttaradhikaar kaa prashn uthaa
 The company's government ordered the Bithur-based commissioner to inform Nanarao that the government considered him to be the heir of the Peshwa Dhan wealth and not the title of Peshwa or the political and personal facilities attached to it
 etdarth peshwa kii gaddi praapt karne ke sambandh main va koi samaaroh yaa pradarshan na karen
 But the ambitious Nanarao took all the property in his hand and took possession of the Peshwa's armory
 thode hi dinon main nanarav ne peshwa kii sabhi oopaadhiyon ko dhaaran kar liya
 Immediately he gave the application to the British Government and demanded a justification for the introduction of the Peshwai pension
 saath hi unhone apane vakil ke saath kharita aadi bhi bheja jo kanpur ke colector ne waapas kar diya tathaa unhen suchit karaayaa ki sarkaar unki peshwai oopaadhiyon ko sweekaar nahin karti
 Nanarao Dhupandant suffered a lot because he had to take care of many dependents
 naanaa sahab ne pension paane ke liye lard dalhousie se likhapadhi kii, kintu jab usne bhi inkaar kar diya to unhone ajimullah khan ko apana vakil niyukt kar maharani victoria ke paas bheja
 Azimulla made many efforts but failed
 lautate samay unhone france, italy tathaa rus aadi kii yatra kii
 After coming back, Azimullah made Nana Saheb aware of his failure, the real situation of the British and the freedom movements of Europe
 nanarav dhoondhupant ko angrej sarkaar ke rukh se bada ksht hua
 They were not silent
 unhone isi samay tirthayatra prarambh kii
 Nana Saheb's departure on a pilgrimage in this age seems somewhat mysterious
 san 1857 main vah kalpi, dilli tathaa lakhanu gaye
 In Kalpi, you met the famous Kunwar Singh of Bihar and imagined a future revolution
 jab meerut main kranti kaa shriganesh hua to naanaa sahab ne badi veerta or dakshata se kranti kii senaaon kaa kabhi gupt rup se or kabhi prakat rup se netritv kiya
 As soon as the revolution started, his followers received eight and a half lakh rupees and some war material from the English treasury
 kanpur ke angrej ek garh main kaid ho gaye or krantikariyon ne vahaan par bhartiya dhwaja fahraai
 All the revolutionaries gathered in Kanpur to go to Delhi
 naanaa sahab ne unka netritv kiya or dilli jane se unhen roak liya kyonki vahaan jaakar ve or khatra hi mol lete
 Nana Saheb declared war from Kalyanpur
 apane sainikon kaa unhone kai tukadiyon main baanta
 When all the British were going on boats from Satichora Ghat in Kanpur, the revolutionaries opened fire on them and many of them were killed
 angrej itihaaskaar iske liye naanaa ke hi doshi maanate hai parantu uske paksh main yathesht pramaan nahin miltaa
 
 1 july 1857 ko jab kanpur se angrejon ne prasthaan kiya to naanaa sahab ne purn swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa kii tathaa peshwa kii oopaadhi bhi dhaaran kii
 Nana Saheb's indomitable courage never waned and he led the revolutionary armies equally
 fatehpur tathaa ang aadi ke sthanon main naanaa ke dal se or angrejon main bheeshan yuddh hue
 Sometimes the revolutionaries won and sometimes the British won
 tathaapi angrej badhate aa rahe the
 After this, Nana Saheb saw the rise of British forces and crossed the river Ganges and departed to Lucknow
 naanaa sahab ek baar phir kanpur laute or vahaan aakar unhone angreji sena ne kanpur va lakhanu ke bich ke maarg ko apane adhikaar main kar liya to naanaa sahab avadh chhodkar ruhelkhand kii ore chale gaye
 On reaching Ruhelkhand, he supported Khan Bahadur Khan
 ab tak angrejon ne yah samaj liya tha ki jab tak naanaa sahab pakade nahin jate, viplav nahin dabaaya ja saktaa
 When the revolutionaries were defeated in Bareilly, then Nana Saheb suffered a lot like Maharana Pratap but he did not surrender before the Firangi and his friends
 angrej sarkaar ne naanaa sahab ko pakadvane ke nimitt bade bade inaam ghoshit kiye kintu ve nishphal rahe
 Truly Nana Saheb's renunciation and independence, his valor and military ability place him on the seat of a prominent figure in Indian history

 Yajna according to Bhagavad Gita 'any work done for the sake of God according to Bhagavad Gita is called Yajna
 paramatma ke nimitt kiye kaary se sanskaar paidaa nahin hote na karm bandhan hota he
 In the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, various types of yagyas have been elaborated by Lord Shri Krishna, while preaching to Arjuna
 shri bhagwan kehete hai, arpan hi brahm he, havi brahm he, agni brahm he, aahuti brahm he, karm rupi samadhi bhi brahm he or jise praapt kiya janaa he vah bhi brahm hi he
 Yajna is considered to be the form of parabrahma
 is sristi se hamen jo bhi praapt he, jise arpan kiya ja rahaa he, jiske dwaara ho rahaa he, vah sab brahm swaroop he arthath sristi kaa kan kan, prayek kriya main jo brahm bhav rakhata he vah brahm ko hi paata he arthath brahm swaroop ho jaataa he
 Karma Yogi Dev performs the ritual of Yajna and other Jnana Yogis perform Yagna Havan by performing Yajna in Brahma Agni
 dev pujan use kehete hai jisamen yoga dwaara adhidaiv arthath jeevatma ko jaanane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 Many yogis worship the soul in the soul in Brahma Agni, that is, worship the Adhigyana
 kai yogi indriyon ke vishyon ko rokkar arthath indriyon ko sanyamit kar havan karte hai, anya yogi shabdaadi vishyon ko indriya rup agni main havan karte he arthath man se indriya vishyon ko rokte haighanya kai yogi sabhi indriyon kii kriyaaon evam praan kriyaaon ko ek karte hai arthath indriyon or praan ko vash main karte hai, unhen niskriy karte hai
 By doing all these vrittis, knowledge is revealed and through the knowledge, self-restraint is done by igniting yogagnas and offering self-sacrifice to all subjects
 is prakaar bhinn bhinn yogi dravya yajna tap yajna tathaa duusare yoga yajna karne vaale he or kai tikshnavrati hokar yoga karte hai yah swadhyay yajna karne vaale purush shabd main shabd kaa havan karte he
 In this way, all these skilled and diligent yoga practitioners perform havan in the form of intelligence in their self
 dravya yajna- is sristi se jo kuch bhi hamen praapt he use ishwar ko arpit kar grahan karnaa
 Tapa Yajna - Seeing where the chanting is going is austerity
 swar evam hath yoga kriyaaon ko bhi tap yajna janaa jaataa he
 Yoga Yagya - To perform every action with the deeds of God is done with dexterity
 tikshn vriti- yama niyam sanyam aadi kathor shaareerik or maansik kriyaaon dwaara man ko nigrah karne kaa prayaas
 sham, dam, uparati, titiksha, samaadhaan, shraddha
 To stop the mind from the world is sham
 bahya indriyon ko rokna dam he
 Do not let wandering senses go astray
 sardi-garmi, sukh-dukh, haani-laabh, maan apmaan ko sharir dharm maanakrasaralata se sah lenaa titiksha he
 It is the solution to put a stopped mind to self-thinking
 kai yogi apan vaayu main praan vaayu kaa havan karte hai jaise anulom vilom se sambandhit shwaas kriya tathaa kai praan vaayu main apan vaayu kaa havan karte hai jaise guda sankuchan athwa siddhasana
 Many havan pran in pran by stopping both types of air, prana and apana, such as laxative and kumbhak pranayama
 kai sab prakaar ke aahaar ko jitkar arthath niyamit aahaar karne vaale praan vaayu main praan vaayu kaa havan karte hai arthath praan ko pusht karte hai
 In this way, all those who destroy the sins of anger and ignorance work by the Yajnas; Those who know Yajna, that is, they know God by knowledge
 yajna se bache hue amrit kaa anubhav karne vaale par brahm paramatma ko praapt hote hai arthath yajna kriya ke parinaam swaroop jo bachataa he vah gyaan brahm swaroop he
 By drinking this nectar of knowledge, that yogi becomes contented and self-centered, but those who do not perform the sacrifice do not feel anything in this world or in the world
