 Initially the child coughs and water flows from the nose

 As the respiratory system is affected, the speed of coughing and coughing increases and at one time, the patient is unable to sleep at night due to cough
 pehle jo keval jaagritavastha main khaansee hoti thi ab vah neend main bhi hone lagati he, jisase baccha khansate-khansate uth jaataa he
 This condition persists for two to four weeks

 Due to mental stress, the whole body starts sweating, disgusting with food
 vah bhojan karnaa nahin chahta
 It is necessary for all infants to be vaccinated with cooker cough
 yah tikaakaran praayah ditipi sanyukt rup main diptheria, tetanus or cooker khaansee diya jaataa he
 Prior infection and vaccination do not guarantee life-long asymmetry
 tathaapi 6 varsh kii aayu ke baad vardhak tikaakaran kii sifarish nahin kii jaati he jab tak ki sankraman na hua ho

 faujee kanoon kaa arth ek ore to shasnadhikariyon kii yah sweekaarokti hoti he ki desh yaa kshetravishesh main aisi sthiti utpann ho gai he jab takat kaa saamana takat se karnaa aavashyak he, at: unke haath main aise asaamaanya adhikaar hone chahie jinka upyog sankat kaal kii avadhi tak desh ke aantarik anchal main kiya ja sake, is sthit main nyaayalayon kii prakriya ke sthaan par karypalika athwa sainik prashaasak ke adeshon ko hi sarvaadhik manyata praapt ho jaati he
 On the other hand, military law is the idea of a legal suffix, whereby the civil courts have tried to control the extraordinary rights which are acquired by the executive to apply to the citizens of the state
 is prakaar faujee kanoon, sainik kanoon se, jo sashastr saindal ke niyantran kaa vishesh kanoon hota he, bhinn he
 When the armed forces are used for the exercise of civil rights, then the army does its work under the control of civil authorities and the criminals are considered in ordinary courts

 In England, the emperor does not have the right to declare a crisis, but at the time of war, the executive has the right to disseminate several arrangements and orders under parliamentary legislation and corresponding acts
 phir bhi, un adhikaron kaa prayog vidhanmandal or nyaayalay ke dohare niyantran main sampann hota he
 In American law, to what extent the President has the right to declare military law, independent of congressional action, and how much control can be exercised by the legislature and the courts in that situation, it is still a matter of dispute and the legal situation in this case is now Is also unclear
 bharat main bhi spasht sanvaidhanik nirdesh ke abhaav main yah vivaadaaspad he ki faujee kanoon kii ghoshnaa kaa adhikari koun he
 The reference to military law is only in the 34th section, which provides for the Compensation Act after the military law is lifted in a particular area
 kintu faujee kanoon se miltaa julata hi dhara 359 ke antargat raashtrapati kaa vah adhikaar hota he jisase vah dhara 21 or 22 ke antargat adhikaron kaa nyaayik nishpaadan sthagit kar de saktaa he
 It is understood that this is basically a form of military law, but it appears that the Supreme Court has left it for dispute, whatever may be adopted in this regard, under Section 352 of the Constitution of the crisis
 The effect of the Declaration on Fundamental Rights is at the same level as that of military law
 is prakaar dhara 358 ke antargat jab tak sankatkalin sthiti kaayam rahati he, karypalika ko dhara 19 kii vyavasthaaon ke ulanghan kaa adhikaar rahata he
 Other fundamental rights may also be suspended by the President for a period of crisis under Section 359 or for the period mentioned in the order
 raashtrapati ke adhikaar par keval itnaa hi niyantran hota he ki sankatkaal kii ghoshnaa sweekruti ke liye sansad ke samaksh prastut kii jaani chahie
 There is no fixed period for presenting this declaration before the Parliament and there is no provision for any penalty if it is not presented, but it ends automatically after two months of the declaration being aired
 ek ghoshnaa ke samaapt hone par phir duusari ghoshnaa jari karne main raashtrapati par koi pratibandh nahin he
 The President's order issued under section 359 should be presented to the Parliament at the earliest
 is prastutikaran ke samay kaa nirnay karnaa karypalika par chhod diya gaya he kyonki yadi raashtrapati kaa aadesh sansad ke samaksh prastut nahin kiya jaataa to bhi iskaa prabhaav kam nahin hota or na hi prastut karne ke abhaav main koi vaidhanik karrwai kii vyavastha he
 During the 1962 Chinese invasion, the President declared a crisis situation by postponing the execution of sections 14, 21 and 22 of the Constitution
 halaat bahut kuch saamaanya ho jane ke baad bhi ghoshnaa ko radd karne main atyadhik vilamb kiye jane par saarvajanik rup se badi aalochana hui thi
 This fact has necessitated the imposition of some further protection in relation to the rights of the crisis, because if it is not so, any unwary officer can abolish the constitution for his convenience and make the military law permanent

 tarangadairghy: 10 km to 1 km Low frequency or LF are radio frequencies that fall between 30 khz – 300 khz
 ise kilometre pattee yaa tarang bhi kehete hai
 Because its wavelength is ten to one kilometer
 a 2
1 khz allocation, the 136 khz band, is available to amateur radio operators in some countries in Europe, New Zealand and French overseas dependencies
 The world record distance for a two-way contact is over 10,000 km from near Vladivostok to New Zealand
 As well as conventional Morse code many operators use very slow computer controlled Morse code or specialized digital communications modes
 a proposal at the WRC-07 World Radiocommunication Conference aims to make this a worldwide amateur radio allocation
 The UK allocated a 2
8 khz sliver of spectrum from 71
6 khz to 74
4 khz beginning in April 1996 to UK amateurs who applied for a notice of variation to use the band on a noninterference basis with a maximum output power of 1 w ERP
 This was withdrawn on 30 June 2003 after a number of extensions in favor of the European-harmonized 136 khz band
 a 1-watt transmission of very slow Morse Code between G3AQC and W1TAG spanned the Atlantic Ocean for 3275 miles on November 21-22, 2001
 In the United States there is a special license free allocation in the longwave range called lowfer
 This experimental allocation between 160 khz and 190 khz is sometimes called the "lost Band"
 Unlicensed operation by the public is permitted south of 60 degrees north latitude, except where interference would occur to ten licensed location service stations located along the coasts
 Regulations for use include a power output of no more than 1 watt, and an antenna / ground-lead length of no more than 15 meters, and a field strength of no more than 4
9 microvolts / meter
 Also, emissions outside of the 160 khz–190 khz band must be attenuated by at least 20 db below the level of the unmodulated carrier
 Many experimenters in this band are amateur radio operators
 a regular service transmitting RTTY marine meteorological information on LF is the German Meteorological Service

 a Brahmin named Sukarma lived near the Devagiri mountain in the south country with his husband Parayana wife Sudesh

 On the wife's request, he married his wife's sister Ghushma, who was a supreme Shiva devotee
 shiv krupa se use ek putr dhan kii prapti hui
 This led to the envy of Sudesh and he found the opportunity and killed the son of Saut

 This legend is described in the Puranas about this Jyotirlinga - Near the Devgiriparvat in the south country, there lived a very bright Taponishta Brahmin named Sudharma
 uski patni kaa naam sudeha tha donon main paraspar bahut prem tha
 He had no trouble of any kind
 lekin unhen koi santan nahin thi

 By the grace of Lord Shiva, a very beautiful and healthy child was born from his womb just a few days later
 bachche ke janm se sudeha or ghushma donon ke hi anand kaa paar na rahaa
 Both days were passing by very comfortably
 lekin na jane kaise thode hi dinon baad sudeha ke man main ek kuvichaar ne janm le liya
 She started thinking, i have nothing in this house
 sab kuch ghushma kaa he
 By now, the sprout of Sudharma's mind had taken the form of a huge tree
 antat ek din usne ghushma ke yuva putr ko raat main sote samay maar daalaa
 Taking his dead body, he threw it in the same pond in which Ghushma used to throw the earthly Shivling daily
 mere pati par bhi usne adhikaar jamaa liya
 He also has children
 yah kuvichaar dhire-dhire uske man main badhane laga
 Here Ghushma's child was also growing up
 dhire-dhire vah jawan ho gaya
 He was also married
 subah hote hi sabko is baat kaa pataa laga
 There was a furore in the whole house
 sudharma or uski putravadhu donon sir petakar foot-footkar rone lage
 But Ghushma, as usual, was engrossed in worshiping Lord Shiva
 jaise kuch hua hi na ho
 After finishing the puja, she started to leave the earthly Shivalingas in the pond
 jab vah talab se lautne lagi usee samay uskaa pyaara laal talab ke bheetar se nikalakar aata hua dikhalaai padaa
 He always came and fell at the feet of Ghushma
 jaise kahin aas-paas se hi ghumkar aa rahaa ho
 At the same time, Lord Shiva also appeared there and started asking Ghushma to ask for the groom
 vah sudeha kii ghanouni karatuut se atyant cruddh ho uthe the
 He was looking forward to cutting his throat with his trident
 ghushma ne haath jodakar bhagavan shiv se kaha- 'prabho! yadi aap mujh par prasann hai to meri us abhaagin bahan ko kshamaa kar den
 Surely he has committed a very heinous sin, but by your mercy i got my son back
 ab aap use kshamaa karen or prabho! My one more prayer is, for the welfare of the people, you should stay in this place forever

 Sometimes satellites can be built even within the Roche border
 yah tab hota he jab upgrah main jamaav keval gurutvkarshan kii vajah se naa ho or uske padaarthon kii aapas main chipakan kaa koi or rasinic yaa bhautik kaaran ho
 In scientific language, it can be said that if the stress confirmation of the satellite is high, then it can remain in the Roche range and collect
 brihaspati kaa upgrah meets or shani kaa upgrah pan iske do udahaaran hai jo rosh seemaa ke andar hote hue bhi barkaraar hai
 But more strange things can be seen in such satellites
 kyonki inaki sataha par bade grah ke gurutvkarshan kaa prabhaav bahut adhik hota he, agar inaki sataha par koi chiz rakh di jaae to kabhi-kabhi vah aankhon ke saamne hi anayas sataha se udakar upgrah se alag ho sakati he

 kalantar main isane vishwavyaapee rup dhaaran kiya
 It includes about 250 laboratories from eighteen countries
 iske mukhya lakshya hai:- In humans, on average, each chromosome contains approximately thirteen million base pairs
 or puure jinom main lagbhag teen sau karod ksharak yugma paye jate hai
 The main objective of the human genome project is to detect the sequence of four bases of DNA present in the characteristic formula of each cell
 jinom ko anukramit karne ke liye sarv pratham di en e kii aavashyaktaa thi, jiske liye maanav daataaon kii sahaayta lee gayi
 People were called around the laboratory or center by giving advertisements
 unke rakt ke namoonay praapt kiye gayi
 Samples were given a number by erasing the donor's name
 isaliye ki koun sa namoona kis vyakti vishesh se liya gaya he, iskaa pataa naa chal sake
 The laboratory concerned would select samples from it
 koshikaon kaa sanvardhan karne ke liye, inaki cell line banaai gayi, taaki ve mar naa saken
 Ultimately, DNA was extracted from these cells
 di en e ke chote chote tukde banaakar use jeevanu main clonan kiya gaya
 Finally, genome sequencing was determined by sequencing all clones with the help of a computer
 jinom kii sanrachana kaa pataa lagane ke liye unnat robotic mashiinon kaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 These machines are capable of processing twelve thousand units per minute 
 is pariyojna se praapt hone vaali jaankaree yaa data kii vishaal maatra, vigyaan ke kshetra main, ek kirtiman he
 Although today we have been able to read the entire genetic code of humans, but this task is not that simple
 shuru se ant tak keval e tii si or ji ke bhinn bhinn anukram se bani hui yah kuta samhita, yadi lekhi jaye, to do sau se adhik dhoorbhaash nirdeshikaayen bhar jaayengin
 Use of the human genome structure is possible only when information about the function of proteins produced by thousands of genes is accessible
 jin main vidyaman di en e ke kshaaron kaa kram protein ke amino amla kaa kram tay karata he
 The project will also explore how genes express themselves
 yah bhi pataa kagaaya jaayegaa, ki maanav jati ke jeenon ke bich itani vibhinnataayen kyon hai or kaise panpin
 The structures of human genes will also be compared to the structures of other organisms
 dophrancis colence, jo ki is maanav pariyojna ke adhyaksh hai, kaa maananaa he, ki 2050 tak jinomix yaa jinom vigyaan ek upyogi vidha ke rup main sthapit ho jaayegaa
 India is also not untouched by the international human genome project
 san 1999 main, chennai main yojit rashtriya vigyaan congress main, jinom sammit naam se ek divasiy satr yojit kiya gaya, jisaki adhyakshata james watson ne kii thi
 In the session, the scientists of the country were of the opinion that India should take advantage of this genome era
 kyonki bharat ke paas paryaapt avasar hai
 In fact, India is a living giant laboratory of genetics due to its ethnic and tribal community
 anthropological survey of india dwaara prakashit pustak pipal of india main bataaya gaya he, ki bharat main vibhinn samudaayon kii kul sankhya chaar hazaar chah sau paitis he, jisamen 75 luptpraaya janajatiyaan bhi shaamil hai
 Scientists at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in Bhart, are engaged in making a genographic map of India
 abtak chaudaa vibhinn samudaayon ke jin pahachaane ja chuke hai
 And the study of the distribution of genes causing common diseases is being studied
 bharat sarkaar ke jaev praudyogiki vibhaag ke anusaar, desh bhar main unnat anusandhan kendron kaa jaal bichaaya jaayegaa
 It plans to set up its first center in Bangalore
 iskaa naam maanav anuvaanshiki anusandhan centre rakhaa gaya he
 It has many applications, the main of which are: - jinom pariyojna kaa sarvaadhik laabh chikitsa kshetra main hoga
 Earlier it used to take many years to find a gene linked to a disease, and hundreds of scientists had to try for it
 jinom anukraman kii jaankaree se aisi jin ke pataa lagane kaa kaary ab kuch maheenon main vaigyanikon kaa ek chota samooh bhi kar sakegaa
 Thirty diseases have been detected so far by direct use of publicly available genome sequencing
 isamen tar-sacks syndrome, cysticks fibroris, harrington rog aadi pramukh hai
 The following objectives will be achieved with this molecular therapy: - maanav jinom pariyojna se praapt data base ke aadhaar par vishisht maamalon main vyakti kii pahchaan saral evam teevr gati se sambhav hogi
 This can prove beneficial in cases where the suspected criminal can be arrested on the basis of his DNA
 yah bhinnata evam paariwarik sambandhon ke maamalon main bhi sahaayak siddh ho saktaa he
 And this will also help in seizing the person involved in crimes, paternal quarrels and family matters
 inase aise sookshm jeevon va anya jeevon kii pahchaan main sahaayta milegi, jo ki vaayu, mrudaa pradooshan ke kaarak va nivarak hai
 By this, health hazards and losses can be assessed, especially in small amounts but in long term radiation exposure, the impact on health
 iske atirikt utparivartajani rasyanon va cancer utpann karne vaale vishakt karkon kaa swasthya par prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 What will be the nature of medicine after almost a hundred years from today? Looking at the constantly progressing biotechnology, it seems that what is impossible today will become the reality of medicine and diagnosis of tomorrow
 maanav jinom kii gutthi sulajhane vaale sarkari or nijee vaigyanik aapasi matbhedon ko abhi tak sulajhaa nahin paae hai jisase unke paraspar sahyog main baadhaaen aa rahi hai
 This project of reading the book of human life has been stuck in many circles of controversy and accusations
 yahaan tak ki maanav diene kii sanrachana kaa prakaashan bhi do alag-alag vigyaan patrikaon main karnaa padaa kyonki aankadon ko lekar baari vivaad tha
 The detection of the functions of proteins made by the human genome from one lakh to one and a half million will make it possible to diagnose the following problems: maanav jinom kaa puraa hona hamaare liye us pustkaalay ke praveshdwar par pahunchane ke samaan he, jisaki vibhinn pustakon main teen sau karod akshar bikhare pade hai
 To read these books, first of all we have to identify the words by mixing those letters, making sentences with commas, semicolons and full breaks, that is, to find genes
 doosraa mahatvapurn kadam hoga, sabhi jeenon ke kaaryon kaa pataa lagaana
 The functions of barely a thousand genes have been detected so far
 teesraa kadam he, us 97% junk di en e ke kaary kaa pataa lagaana
 Bioinformatics, or bioinformatics, is a new field of biology that covers the acquisition, storage, processing, analysis, distribution, interpretation, etc
 of bioinformatics
 is kaary main jeev vigyaan soochna takanic tathaa ganit kii takneekein upyog main laai jaatin hai
 Bioinformatics requires the following tools: maanav sharir main anek prakaar ke protein hote hai
 Proteins have long chains of amino acids, and they are made up of 20 different amino acids
 prayek amino amla ke rasinic gun bhinn hote hai, tathaa unka vibhinn proteinon main hone vaala anukram bhi bhinn hota he
 Because of this, each protein is a specially structured and this structure is suitable in every way for its function
 protein kisi jeev kii jivan kshamta or koshikeey kriyavidhi ke liye sidhe sidhe uttaradaayi hote hai
 Proteinomics is a science by which we can analyze the proteins found in the cells of the human body at different times, at the same time, and at a rapid speed
 or isse koshika main proteinon kii antahsthioti kaa maanchitr taiyaar kar sakate hai
 In English it is called structural genomics
 jinom anukraman pariyojnaon kii safalataa tathaa protein sanrachanaon ko sulajhane ke anek prayaason ne sanrachana jaev vaigyanikon ko sanrachana jinomix ke vikaas ke liye protsaahit kiya he
 This field has also developed extensively, under which the purpose of solving the structure of all the proteins of humans is
 protein hi har jeev kii sanrachana karte hai
 Not only this, digestive disease prevention, body chemistry also determine all activities
 sankshep main har praani kaa praan protein hi he
 If the same protein is ingested in some way or some part of it is lost, then there is a possibility of disease
 isko jaanane ke liye protein sanrachana kaa gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Human being is identified by its qualities and name
 do vyakti sabhi gunon main samaan nahin hote
 Even twins, no matter how similar, still have differences
 twachaa kaa rang, baalo kaa rang, ankhon kii putliyon kaa rang, lambaai, awaz, chalane, uthne baithne kaa dhang, baat karne kaa tarika, rahan-sahan aadi aise lakshan hai, jinase manushyon main antar or pahchaan kii ja sakati he
 There was a need to legalize human personal identity and difference
 prayek maanav ke anguliyon ke nishaan bhinn hote hai
 The protuberances in them occur at different places
 is kaaran jo chitra banataa he, use angul chhap yaa finger print kehete hai
 In fact, it is a method of legally identifying humans, which francis-golton discovered long ago and is still practiced today
 yah prakruti kii dein he
 The Jeevan Sutra, that is, in all living organisms of the world, is based on heredity like humans
 yah kisi bhi jeev kii har sookshm ikai main paaya jaataa he
 Each organism can be distinguished from any other organism on the basis of subtle variations hidden in this life formula derived from its biological parents
 di en e finger printing ek nutan evam shashakt takanic he, jo nimnlikhit kshetron main prayog main laayi ja sakati he:- In 1988, the research group of Dr
 Lalji Singh, Senior Scientist, Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India, conducted B

 Developed a disease called
 is prakaar dolal ji singh ke prayaason se aaj bharat vishwa kaa teesraa desh he, jahaan purnataya swadeshi di en e finger printing prob ko viksit kiya gaya he
 Through DNA sealing, positive identification can be done at the individual level through blood semen, hair, mutilated dead body remains, teeth or bone fragments etc
 atah yah vidhi hatya, balaatkaar, amaanushnaik krityon tathaa jaghanya aparaadhon, pravas-patr prapti, sampatti uttaradhikaar, vivaah viched evam divaani mukademon main mata-pita kii sakaaratmak pahchaan ityadi maamalon main atyant aavashyak maani jane lagi he
 Because each person has a DNA of both the parents, this can be confirmed on the basis of the impression of the DNA
 forensik jaev praudyogiki abhi ek nayaa kshetra he, jo jangalon main hone vaale aparaadhon ko sulajhaayen ke liye ek hathiyaar kii tarah prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The Indian judicial system has accepted DNA finger printing as concrete evidence
 mritak ke sharir ke bikhare hue tukdon kii pahchaan karne ke liye bhi is takanic kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 This technique was used for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and former Chief Minister of Punjab Beant Singh
 inke atirikt anek aparaadhon ke maamle is takanic dwaara sulajhaaye gaye hai
 Comparison of the commands received by DNA finger printing with the remains of the bodies of the dead defensemen during accidents, such as a war period, or a shipwreck, as compiled in the biographies of defense personnel
 The method can be proven
 garbh-dhaaran se purv yaa garbh ke dauraan hi, is vidhi dwaara aanivaanshik rogon evam antarjaat trutiyon kii jaankaree praapt kii ja sakati he or in vikaron kii aavriti ko ek seemaa tak niyantrit karke samast maanav jati kii is samasya kaa samaadhaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Dna finger krishi evam bagwani ke kshetra main bijon kii sahi jati kaa pareekshan di en e finger printing ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 It can prove to be more good and help in the development of desired castes
 yah vidhi ek hi prakaar ke nar yaa maadaa paudhon ke chayan main sahaayak siddh ho sakati he
 Such as guava, dates, etc
, in which only female plants are desired, and the gender is known only after a long time
 aise maamalon main is vidhi kaa prayog karke samay, shram evam dhan kii bachat kii ja sakati he
 The DNA fingerprinting method can prove the originality of the cell and can be expected to progress in both the fields of research and industry, or industry only, by being used in other research works
 jab di en e ke bahut se bhaagon kaa adhyayan ek hi saath kiya jaataa he, to vah di en e finger priting kehalaata he, tathaa jab di en e ke ek hi bhaag kaa pareekshan kiya jaataa he, to use di en e typing kehete hai
 The more parts are tested simultaneously, the greater the reliability of finger prints
 clonan ke saath jaev praudyogiki ne ek or kshetra ko janm diya he, jiskaa naam he –koshika chikitsa
 Under this, such cells are studied which have the ability to grow, divide and differentiate to form new tissues
 sarvapratham rakt banane vaale utakon se is chikitsa kaa vichaar va prayog shooru hua tha
 These cells, derived from the bone marrow, produce blood in the body for a lifetime, and the entire blood system can be reabsorbed by transplanting them in diseases like cancer
 aisi koshikaon ko stem koshika yaa stem cell kehete hai
 In the diagnosis of heart disease and diabetes, differentiated cells are of great importance
 neurological rogon main bhi visheshtah tantrikaon kaa pratyaropan inaki avasthaaon main sudhaar laane kii kshamta rakhata he
 Damaged organs can also be repaired
 phonograph mashin kaa ek naam gramophone bhi he
 This machine used to have a cassette
 is casette main gaanaa yaa koi bhi baat ricard hoti thi
 The face of this machine is round and neck is thin
 isamen ek tandi hoti he jise casette par rakhaa jaataa he or casette chaalu ho jaati he

 Judo is a modern Japanese martial art and combat sport created in 1882 in Japan by Dr
 Kano Jigoro
 isaki sabase pramukh visheshta iskaa pratispardhi tatv he, jiskaa uddeshy apane pratidwandvi ko yaa to jameen par patakana, gatiheen kar dena yaa nahin to kushti kii chaalon se apane pratidwandvi ko apane vash main kar lenaa, yaa joint lock karke arthath jodon ko uljhaakar yaa galaa ghontkar yaa dam ghontu takneekon kaa istemaal karke apane pratidwandvi ko samarpan karne ke liye majaboor kar dena he
 Hand and foot strikes and blows, as well as weapons protection, are a part of judo but are only used in pre-arranged methods as it is not allowed in judo competition or free practice
 judo ke liye viksit darshan or parvarti prashikshan anya aadhunik japani marshall art ke model ban gaye jinka vikaas paaramparik skulon se hua tha
 The worldwide spread of judo has led to the development of several sub-disciplines such as Sambo, Baratitsu and Brazilian jiu-jitsu after the introduction of Judo in Brazil in 1914 by Mitsuyo Maeda
 judo ke abhyaasakartaaon yaa peshewaron ko judoka kaha jaataa he
 The early history of judo cannot be distinguished from its founder, the Japanese erudite and teacher Jigoro Kano
 kaano kaa janm ek khushhaal japani parivaar main hua tha
 His grandfather was a wine maker from the Shiga-ruled province of central Japan, achieving success in his hard work
 baharhaal, kaano ke pita apane pita ke sabase bade bete nahin the or isliye unhen yah kaarobaar viraasat main nahin mila
 Instead, he became a Shinto priest and government official and at the same time he had sufficient sovereignty to enroll his son in the second coming class of Tokyo Imperial University
 kaano apane bachapan main kaaphi kamjor the, unka kad bhi kaaphi kam tha or unka vajan bees saal kaa hone par bhi ek sau pound se zyada nahin tha or vah aksar dabangon dwaara sataae jate the
 He followed jujutsu at the age of 17, when the art was beginning to end, but he achieved very little success in it
 aisa kuch had tak unhen ek chaatr ke rup main apnaane vaale ek shikshak ke milane main takalif hone kii vajah se hua tha
 He continued to study his martial arts while going to university to study literature at the age of 18, and eventually he heard of Fukuda Hachinosuke, the master of Tenjin Shin'yo-riu and grandfather of Keiko Fukuda, Joe Kano is the only surviving student of Kano and the highest ranked female judoka in the world
 kaha jaataa he ki phukuda hachinosuke ne judo main mukt abhyaas par kaano ke gurucharan ke beej bokar aupchaarik abhyaas kii takanic par jor diya tha
 More than a year after Kano joined Fukuda's school, Fukuda fell ill and died
 uske baad kaano ek anya tengin shin'yo-riyu skool ke chaatr ban gaye jo iso masatomo kaa tha jo phukuda kii tulana main purv-vyavasthit tareekon ke abhyaas par zyada jor dete the
 On the strength of his dedication, Kano quickly acquired the title of accomplished instructor and at the age of 21 became Iso's assistant instructor
 durbhaagya se, iso jald biimaar pad gaye or kaano ne yah mahasoos karte hue kito-riyu ke aikubo sunetoshi ke chaatr banakar ek duusari style ko apana liya ki unhen abhi bahut kuch siikhnaa he
 Like Fukuda, Ikubo placed much emphasis on free practice
 duusari taraf, kito-riyu main tengin shin'yo-riyu kii tulana main kaaphi had tak patakane kii takneekon par jor diya jaataa tha
 By this time, Kano was devising new techniques, such as "shoulder wheel" and "floating hip" bets
 However, he was already considering doing more than just expanding the principles of kito-ryu and Tenjin shin'yeo-ryu
 nae vichaaron se bhare kaano ke dimag main jujutsu ke ek pramukh sudhaar kii yojana thi jisaki takneekein kaaphi achche vaigyanik siddhanton par aadhaarit thi or jiskaa mukhya uddeshy marshall art kii bahaduree ke vikaas ke alaava yuvaaon ke sharir, dimag or charitra kaa bhi vikaas karnaa tha
 In May 1882, at the age of 22, at the end of his undergraduate degree at the university, Kano began training jujutsu to nine students of Ikubo's school in a Buddhist temple called Aisho-ji in Kamakura, and Ikubo He used to come there three days a week to help in training
 haalanki us mandir ko "kodocan" yaa "tarika sikhaane kii jagah" ke naam se pukaare jane se pehle do saal biit chuke the or kaano ko us vaqt tak kito-riyu ke "master" yaa guru kaa khitaab nahin diya gaya tha, lekin ise ab kodocan kii sansthapana mana jaataa he
 Judo was actually known as kano jiu-jitsu or kano jiu-do and later kodokan jiu-do or simply jiu-do or judo
 shuru ke dinon main ise us vaqt tak saamaanya rup se keval jiu-jitsu ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa tha
 The word "judo" derives from the same hieroglyphs from where the word "jujutsu" originated: "jū", which can also mean "gentleness", "tenderness", "flexibility" and "easy" depending on its context
 is
 haalanki jū kaa anuwaad karne ke aise prayaas bhraamak hote hai
 The use of jū in each of these terms is a clear reference to the martial arts theory of the "soft method"
 komal tareeke ko pratidwandvi ko haraane ke liye lagaae jane vaale bal ke apratyaksh anuprayog dwaara abhilakshyit kiya jaataa he
 More specifically, it is the principle of using one's opponent's strengths against them and adapting to changing circumstances
 udhaaharan ke liye, hamalavar par uskaa pratidwandvi hamalaa karne ke liye ek taraf hat saktaa he or use aage kii taraf patakane ke liye apni takat kaa istemaal kar saktaa he 
 kaano ne jujutsu ko chaalon kii ek asangat thili ke rup main dekha jise vah ek siddhant ke anusaar ekajute karnaa chaahate the jiskaa samaadhaan unhen "adhiktam kshamta" kii dharna main mila
 Jujutsu techniques relying only on superior strength were accepted or rejected in favor of redirecting the opponent's force, distorting the opponent's balance, or using better leverage
 judo or jujutsu ke duusare lakshanon main antar he
 Where jujutsu means "art" of tenderness, "science", or "technique", judo means "path" of tenderness
 "dō" ke istemaal, jiskaa matlab rasta, sadak yaa path he, main darshanik makasad chipa hua he
 This is similar to the difference between Budo and Bujutsu
 is shabd ke istemaal se pracheen marshall art ke us vichaar ko nikaal diya gaya he jiskaa ekmaatr uddeshy jaan se maarna tha
 Kano saw judo as a means of overcoming and improving himself physically, mentally, emotionally and morally
 He also expanded the physical principle of maximum potential in daily life and developed it into "mutual prosperity"
 is sambandh main, judo ko dojo kii bandishon ke baahar acchhee tarah se jivan kaa vistaar karne ke ek samgr drushtikon ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The practitioner of judo is known as judoka or "judo practitioner", although traditionally only those with fourth dan or higher status were called "judoka"
 jab kisi angrezi sangya shabd ke saath -ka pratyay jod diya jaataa he to iskaa matlab ek aise vyakti se hota he jo us vishay kaa visheshgy hota he yaa jiske paas us vishay kaa vishesh gyaan hota he
 Other practitioners below the fourth dan were called Kenkyu-sei or "trainees"
 aadhunik samay main judoka kaa matlab kisi bhi str kii visheshgyata vaale judo abhyaasakarta se he
 The judo teacher is called sensei
 sensei shabd kii utpatti sen yaa saki or sei se hui he jiskaa matlab us vyakti se he jo aapse pehle aayaa he
 In the Western Dojo, it is common for any trainer with dan status to be called a sensei
 paramparaagat rup se, vah kitaab chauthe dan yaa usase oonche darje ke prashikshakon ke liye arakshit he
 Traditionally Judo practitioners wear a white colored uniform called Judogi which generally means the "judo dress" worn to practice Judo
 kabhi-kabhi is shabd ko chota karke keval 'gi ' ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Judogi was produced by Kano in 1907, and later similar uniforms were adopted by many other martial arts
 aadhunik judogi safed yaa nile rang kii sooti ke kapade kii karshan dori vaali pant or isse mail khaati hui safed yaa nile rang kii sooti ke kapade kii razaai kii tarah sili hui jacket se bana hota he jise ek belt se kas diya jaataa he
 The belt or waistband is usually colored to indicate status or position
 jacket ko is iraade se banaaya jaataa he ki vah kushti ke dabaav ko jhel sake or isiilie ise karate kii vardi kii tulana main kaaphi motaa banaaya jaataa he
 The Judogi is made in such a way that it is easy to hold the opponent on it while Karategi is made from the material that makes the raincoat coat so that the opponent cannot get hold of this material
 aajkal ke nile judogi ke istemaal kaa sabase pehla suzav 1986 ke maustrict ijeef disi meeting main anton gisink ne diya tha
 For the competition, one of the two contestants wears a blue color pair to make it easier for judges, decision-makers and spectators to differentiate the two
 In Japan, both judokas use a white colored judogi and a traditional red sash is affixed to a contestant's belt
 Outside of Japan, a colored sash can also be used to facilitate minor contestants' contests, a blue color pair only required for regional or high level competitions
 japani abhyaasakarta or shuddhtavaadi nile range ke judogi ke istemaal ko tuchh samajhate hai
 While judo includes various types of legs, such as rolling, falling, throwing, squatting, strangulation, jiggling and attacking joints, more attention is paid to throwing and groundwork in particular
 phenkane kii takanic ko do tarah ke takneekon ke samooh main vibhajit kiya gaya he jisame se ek he - sthaayee takanic or doosraa he - sacrifice techniques 
 iske alaava sthaayee takanic ko hand techniques, hip techniques or foot and leg techniques main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The sacrifice technique is divided into those in which the thrower falls directly backwards and those in which he falls onto his side
 jamini ladaai kii takneekon ko attacks against the joints or joint locks, strangleholds or chokeholds or holding or pinning techniques main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 a type of boxing is practiced in judo known as randori which means "free practice"
 randori main, do pratidwandvi judo kii kisi bhi patakane yaa pakadaney kii takanic kaa istemaal karke ek duusare par hamalaa kar sakate hai
 Kata retains techniques of hitting, such as kicking and punching, as well as knives and swordplay techniques
 is tarah kaa adhyaapan aam taur par oonche darje ke abhyaasakartaaon ke liye arakshit hota he, lekin pratiyogita main isaki manaahi hoti he or suraksha kii drushti se aam taur par randori main ise nishedh kar diya jaataa he
 From the point of view of safety, strangulation, dislocating joints and sacrificial techniques are banned on the basis of age and status
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main galaa ghontne kii takanic kaa istemaal karne ke liye vyakti kii umr 13 yaa usase adhik honi chahie or bhujaaon ko uljhane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne ke liye 16 yaa usase adhik umr kaa hona jaruri he
 In the practice of rhetoric and competition, when one opponent is able to use a strangulation or joint manipulation technique, the other opponent gives up or is "beaten" and thus beats the opponent twice
 Giving up gives a clear indication that the opponent has lost
 jab aisa hota he to match khatm ho jaataa he or maat khaane vaala khilaadi haar jaataa he or us par kiye gaye galaa ghontne yaa jodon ko uljhane kii takanic se use aaazaad kar diya jaataa he
 Spun forms are pre-arranged methods of attack and defense that are practiced in judo with a partner for the purpose of mastering the techniques of judo
 adhik vishesh rup se, unke uddeshyon main shaamil hai - judo ke buniyadi siddhanton ko samajhaana, takanic ke sahi istemaal kaa pradarshan karnaa, un darshanik siddhanton kii shiksha dena jis par judo aadhaarit he, un takneekon ke abhyaas kii ijaajat dena jinhen pratiyogita main istemaal karne kii ijaajat nahin hoti he or un pracheen takneekon ko surakshit rakhana jo aitihaasik drushti se mahatvapurn he lekin jinka ab samakaleen judo main istemaal nahin kiya jaataa he
 Knowledge of different types of spun is required to get high status
 aaj ke daur main kodocan dwaara manyata praapt saat kata is prakaar hai: There are also some spun ones that have not been officially recognized by Kodokan but continue to practice
 inkaa sabase pramukh udhaaharan 'go no sen no kata' naamak ek kata he jisamen prayasarat prahaar par javaabi hamalaa karne par dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Judo emphasizes a free-style boxing practice called randori which is one of its main forms of training
 mukaable ke samay kaa kuch bhaag mukkebaaji ke abhyaas ko sthaayee banane main lag jaataa he jise tachi-waja kehete hai or baaki kaa bhaag jameen par lagata he jise ne-waja kehete hai
 Boxing is also practiced according to the rules of safety, which is more lively than simply practicing the techniques that jujutsuka used to do before
 puri takat ke istemaal se shaareerik drushti se mansapeshiyon or hridayavahini tantra kaa vikaas hota he or maansik drushti se ranneeti or pratikriya samay kaa vikaas hota he or ek virdohi pratidwandvi ke khilaaf takneekon kaa istemaal karne kii sikh hasil karne main abhyaasakarta ko madad milti he
 There is a common saying among judokas, “the best training of judo is judo
 " There are many types of boxing exercises, such as Xu Renshu; And Kakari Geiko judo main, ladaai karne ke do mukhya charan hote hai: khadaa hokar yaa sthaayee charan, tachi-waja ; or jamini charan, ne-waja ; prayek charan ke liye apni khud kii takneekon, ranneetiyon, randori, condishning yaa anukulan, ityadi kii jarurat padati he
 Special training in "transitional" techniques is also given to bridge the gap
 judoka ek charan main kaaphi kushal ho saktaa he or duusare charan main thodaa kamjor bhi pad saktaa he jo is baat par nirbhar karata he ki unki zyaadaatar dilchaspee kismen hai haalanki zyaadaatar donon ke darmyaan santulit hote hai
 Judo's inclusion of both permanent and on-field stages of combat gives Judoka the ability to pull down her permanent or standing opponent and then force her to surrender by giving her trouble on the ground
 sthaayee yaa khadey charan main, jise pratiyogita ke niyamon ke anusaar pradhanta milti he, pratidwandvi ek duusare ko patakane kii koshish karte hai yaa khadey hokar jodon ko uljhane or galaa ghontkar / galaa dabaakar samarpan karne par majaboor karne vaali takanic kaa istemaal karte hai jabaki niyam ke hisaab se khadey yaa sthaayee charan main aisa bahut kam hota he kyonki patakane kii tulana main khadey rahakar in takneekon kaa istemaal karnaa zyada mushkil hota he
 However, some judokas are quite adept at using both techniques of forcing their opponent down, as well as forcing them to surrender, where the technique of forcing surrender begins in a standing position and ends on the ground
 it occurs
 haalanki jodon ko uljhaakar patakane kii takanic kaa istemaal karnaa nishiddh he
 The main purpose of the downward technique is to slam an opponent standing on his feet, standing in a dynamic position or standing in a dangerous position, on the ground on his back where he cannot move as effectively
 is prakaar, neeche giraane yaa patakane kii mukhya vajah pratidwandvi ko kaabo main karnaa or khud ko prabhaavshaalee sthiti main laana he
 In this way the practitioner has more ability to produce a conclusive result
 pratidwandvi ko neeche giraane kaa ek or kaaran jameen par use jabardastee patakekar uske sharir ko chot pahunchaana bhi he
 If the opponent downsizes his opponent with great force and complete control, he can clearly win the match on the basis that he has demonstrated sufficient superiority, being given less points if he falls down less effectively
 is
 khadey hokar apane pratidwandvi ko neeche giraane par hi giraanevaale pratidwandvi ko ank diya jaataa he
 In harmony with Kano's mastery of scientific analysis and reasoning, standard Kodokan judo pedagogy determines that any downward technique is theoretically a four-step phenomenon: distorting equilibrium; body positioning; execution; And finally the finish or coup de grâce
 Each step is followed quite rapidly after the previous stage; Ideally all steps follow almost simultaneously
 isi tarah, chot lagane kii zyada sambhaavna hone kii vajah se maarane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne kii ijaajat nahin di jaati he lekin khilaadi ko prashikshan ke dauraan "is takanic ko dhyaan main rakhana" hota he, udhaaharan ke liye, zyada der tak jhukkar ladaai na karnaa, kyonki is sthiti main badi aasaani se ghutanon par hamalaa karke yaa anya jagahon par hamalaa karke ghayal kiya ja saktaa he
 In the competition, the contest on the ground may continue after the downing process or else the contestants may legally end their fight on the ground; Contestants are not allowed to fall to the ground just to start the ne-vaja
 jameen par, pratiyogiyon kaa lakshya apane pratidwandvi kaa galaa ghontkar yaa galaa dabaakar yaa uski bhujaaon ko uljhaakar yaa to use neeche giraae rakhana yaa use samarpan karne par majaboor kar dena he
 Hold downs, self-defense, police work and military hands-on combat are important because the person who overcomes his opponent can defend or attack quite easily
 judo main, yadi pakad kar neeche giraane kii koshish ko pachchis second tak banaae rakhaa jaataa he, to is takanic kaa istemaal karne vaala vyakti match jeet jaataa he
 Osakomi tries to knock his opponent down primarily by holding his back and if he turns to the front or side, a mat will be called
 
 After that the two judokas will stand again and after that they will continue their fight or continue fighting
 1905 main sthapit niyamon ke anusaar, pratidwandvi ko keval uske kandhon se do second tak pakad kar rakhana jaruri tha—kaha jaataa he ki ek samurai ko apni chaaku yaa talwaar tak pahunchane or apane pakade hue pratidwandvi ko haarane ke liye itnaa hi samay lagata tha
 The new longer requirements may relate to the combat reality that the fighter, police officer, or soldier must stagnate their opponent in sufficient time to establish control over the situation
 judo main, kabhi-kabhi pakad kar rakhane kii takanic ke parinamswaroop pratidwandvi samarpan kar saktaa he yadi us pratidwandvi main us pakad ke dabaav ko sahane kii kshamta na ho yaa pakad ko banaae rakhane ke liye samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii takanic kaa istemaal kiya gaya ho
 In addition, if the technique of strangling or engaging the arms becomes too heavy on the judoka, or if the judoka starts to ache or gets hurt, he can surrender
 agar pakad kar giraae jane vaale vyakti ne apane pairon ko apane pratidwandvi ke sharir ke nichle bhaag yaa dhad ke kisi hisse ke ird-gird lapet liya he to vah bhi apane pratidwandvi ko utana hi giraane kii koshish kar rahaa hota he jitani koshish uskaa pratidwandvi use giraane ke liye kar rahaa hota he kyonki uskaa pratidwandvi tab tak khadaa nahin ho saktaa he or aaazaad nahin ho saktaa he jab tak neeche uske sharir se lipta hua vyakti use nahin chodta he
 The bottom man can use various attacking techniques on his opponent, including strangling, entangling arms, while wrapping his legs around his opponent to make him unable to attack effectively from above
 And "body Scissors", meaning 'causing difficulty in breathing by putting pressure on the body'
 is haalat main, jise japani bhashaa main "do-osa " kehete hai jiskaa matlab "trunk hold" arthath 'dhad par dabaav banaae rakhana' he, upar vaala vyakti osakomi kahalaane vaali is sthiti kii vajah se apane pratidwandvi par paryaapt niyantran nahin rakh paata he
 The person above may try to escape from his opponent's feet and in turn force him to fall down or surrender, or he may try to break his opponent's guard and stand up
 neeche vaala vyakti apane guard vaali takanic kii madad se apane pratidwandvi ko samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii koshish kar saktaa he yaa apane pratidwandvi ke upar chadhane ke liye use ludhakaane kii koshish kar saktaa he
 Joint lock ie 'jointing technique' is generally known as 'arm lock' ie 'arm entangling technique'
 yah mukaable kii prabhaavshaalee takanic he kyonki isse ek judoka apane pratidwandvi ko dard dekar use apane kaabo main karne main sakasham ho jaataa he yaa jarurat padane par uljhaae hue jodon ko bhi todane main sakasham ho jaataa he
 The use of the technique of engaging the elbow joints by applying almost full force in the competition to force your opponent to surrender is considered quite safe
 ateet main, judo main pairon ko uljhane, kalai ko uljhane, ridh kii haddi ko uljhane or vibhinn tarah kii anya takneekon kaa istemaal karne kii ijaajat thi jise khilaadiyon kii suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue pratiyogita main varjit kar diya gaya he
 It has been decided that players will suffer many injuries due to attacking those joints and due to this, the condition of those joints will gradually deteriorate
 Nevertheless, some judokas still enjoy informally learning and fighting each other using these techniques that are prohibited in formal competitions but related arts such as Sambo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and jujutsu are still in them
 Many techniques have been actively used since
 Chokes and strangulations ko aam taur par or saamaanya rup se galaa dabaakar dam ghontne kii takanic ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 With this help a person can use the strangling technique to make his opponent unconscious and even to sleep to death
 galaa dabaane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne par gardan kii greeva dhamni par dabaav padane se mastishk tak hone vaali khun kii aapurti band ho jaati he jabaki galaa ghontne kii takanic kaa istemaal karne par gardan ke saamne kaa vayumarg avaruddha ho jaataa he
 These words are often used interchangeably and are not formally differentiated in their use by most judokas
 pratiyogita main, us samay judoka kii jeet ho jaati he jab uskaa pratidwandvi samarpan kar detaa he yaa behosh ho jaataa he, kyonki galaa dabaane kii takanic kaa sahi tarah se istemaal hone par pratidwandvi bas kuch second main hi behosh ho saktaa he lekin iske baad turant mukt kar dene par aam taur par koi nuksaan nahin hota he
 Judo has evolved into a sport, along with a completely specialized martial art
 olympic main pehali baar judo ko los angeles main yojit 1932 games main dekha gaya tha jahaan kaano or lagbhag 200 judo chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 In the 1964 Games held in Tokyo, judo became an Olympic sport for men
 rena kanokogi, ek america or kai anya kii jidd kii vajah se 1988 main judo mahilaon kaa bhi ek olympic khel ban gaya
 It is often said that the men's judo event in 1964 was a demonstration event, but according to the International Judo Federation (international Judo Union) and the International Olympic Committee, the International Olympic Committee, judo was actually an official sport of the 1964 Games
 hollandwasi anton gisink ne japan ke akiyo kaminaga ko haraakar judo ke open divizan main pehla olympic swarna padak praapt kiya
 Judo's image of being "japanese only" was then lost and became one of the most widely practiced sports in the world
 mahilaon kaa kaarykram 1988 kaa ek pradarshan kaarykram tha or chaar saal baad yah ek aadhikarik padak kaarykram ban gaya
 Men and women compete separately, although they often receive training together
 1988 ke baad se paraolympic judo ek paraolympic khel bana hua he; yah special olympic kaa khel bhi he
 Collegiate competition in the United States, particularly between UC Berkeley and San Jose State University, contributed to refining judo in sports seen at the Olympic Games and World Championships
 1940 ke dashak main henry stone or yosh uchida, cyle or esageesayu ke pramukh coach, ne skulon ke bich aksar hone vaali pratiyogitaaon main istemaal karne ke liye ek wet class system arthath vajan varg pranali viksit kii
 In 1953, Stone and Uchida made a successful request to the Amateur Athletic Union to accept judo as a sport, with their weight class system as an official component
 1961 main, uchida ne paris main ijeef kii baithkon main sanyukt rajya america kaa pratinidhitiv kiya jahaan ijeef ne sabhi bhavi championships ke liye wet class system ko apana liya
 The IJF was built mostly on the basis of the early European Judo Union where weight class systems were also used for many years
 vartmaan main saat wet divizan hai jisamen shaasi nikaayon dwaara badlaav kiya ja saktaa he or pratiyogiyon kii umr ke aadhaar par inamen sanshodhan bhi kiya ja saktaa he: The objective of traditional judo rules is to avoid injury to the participants and to ensure proper etiquette
 dekhne waalon ke liye is khel ko or dilachasp banane ke liye in niyamon main kuch or niyam shaamil kiye gaye
 Penalties can be imposed for staying inactive or using illegal techniques during a match
 yadi koi pratibhaagi mat ke nirdhaarit kshetra ke baahar chalaa jaataa he to ladaai band kar di jaani chahie
 If the groundwork means that the judges and judges need some deliberation during the fight, then the adjudicator will say sono-mama and both will have to stay in the same position
 jab unka kaam ho jaataa he to nirnaayak yoshi kahata he or match chaalu ho jaataa he
 All marks or penalties are awarded by the judge
 nirnaayak dwaara die gaye ank yaa dand ko badalane ke liye nyaayakarta ek faisla le sakate hai
 There is a slight difference in IJF rules to facilitate the judo of blind people
 judo ke ek match kaa uddeshy pratidwandvi ko uske kandhon ke bal jameen par patakana; mukhya rup se uski peeth ke bal jameen par giraanaa; yaa uskaa galaa ghontkar, dam ghontkar yaa uski bhujaaon ko uljhaakar use samarpan karne par majaboor karnaa he
 Ippon is awarded as a point for one of these, after which the match is won immediately
 judo main ank praapt karne ke teen grad yaa darje hai: ippon, waja-ari or yuko 
 ippon kaa shabdic arth "ek ank" hota he jisase match jeeta jaataa he
 Rapidly and vigorously in a controlled manner, the opponent mostly slams his back to the ground; Keeping your opponent on the mat for a substantial period; Or an Ippon is given to force the opponent to surrender
 ippon paane laayak paryaapt shakti yaa niyantran ke pradarshan ke abhaav ke saath pratidwandvi ko jameen par patakane; yaa bees second tak use jameen par giraae rakhane ke liye ek waja-ari diya jaataa he
 a vaja-ari means half a mark and if a vaja-ari is attained, then a full score is made from them which is necessary to win
 yuko, ank praapt karne kaa nichalaa darja he or isaki ginati keval ek 'taai braker' ke rup main kii jaati he; ise anya yuko ankon ke saath nahin joda jaataa he
 Scoring is lexicographic; a Vaja-ari beats out any number of Yuko, but a Vaja-ari and a Yuko outperform the Yukoless Vaja-ari
 apane pratidwandvi pandrah second tak jameen par giraae rakhane par yuko ank praapt hota he
 If a person who uses the technique of knocking down has already received a Vaja-ari, then he or she needs to hold their opponent down to the ground for only twenty seconds in order to earn an Ippon point through two vaja-aris
 
 ek ippon yaa ek waja-ari ank kii aavashyaktaaon ke abhaav ke saath pratidwandvi ko jameen par patakane ke liye ek yuko ank praapt ho saktaa he
 The so-called "skillful takedown" is also allowed to "fall to the ground efficiently" but no points are obtained for it
 yadi match ke ant main kul prapthank ekasmaan hote hai, to is samasya ko golden score' arthath 'swarna ank niyam dwaara suljhaayaa jaataa he
 The Golden Score is an accidental death situation where the clock is re-set for the time of the match, and meanwhile any contestant who wins the first point wins
 agar is avadhi ke dauraan koi ank hasil nahin kiya jaataa he, to hantei arthath 'nirnaayak or do mukhya nyaayakartaaon ke bahumat vichaar' ke madhyam se vijeta kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Judo's scoreboard shows the number of vaja-ari and Yuko received by each player
 ippon dene par match turant khatm ho jane kii vajah se scoreboard par aksar ippon ko nahin dikhaaya jaataa he
 Some computerized scoreboards may indicate a clear indication of an Ippon score
 aam taur par scoreboard par prayek khilaadi ko die gaye dandon kii sankhya or kabhi-kabhi prayek ko di gai chikitsa vyavastha kii sankhya ko bhi dikhaaya jaataa he
 Electronic scoreboards also typically have a timer to measure both contest time and ossecomy time
 vibhinn suraksha sambandhon kaarnon se judo ke niyam hameshaa badalte rahete hai
 They may change depending on the age, status or experience of the judoka
 desh, club yaa pratiyogita ke str ke aadhaar par bhi unamem badlaav ho saktaa he 
 The first is a warning in the form of a penalty that is written on the scoreboard
 duusare dand ke rup main pratidwandvi ko "yuko" ank diya jaataa he
 "vaja-ari" marks are given as the third penalty
 chauthe dand ko "hansoku maake" kaha jaataa he or pratidwandvi ko ek "ippon" ank de diya jaataa he
 The match ends permanently with "hansoku Māke"
 gambhir niyamollanghanon ke liye pratiyogi ko ek pratyaksh "hansoku maake" mil saktaa he
 In this case, the player receiving the "hansoku Makae" is eliminated from the tournament
 judo, duniya bhar ke kai sainya akramanakari or rakshaatmak ranneetiyon ke prashikshan kaa aadhaar ban gaya he
 In addition, the combination of judo's background in traditional jujitsu with its police and military uses has resulted in the arrival of kata specifically geared to training the technical principles of self-defense: kime no kata and kodokan goshin jutsu
 Renkoho Vaja includes techniques specifically designed for the police
 joshi judo goshinho main mahilaon kii aatmaraksha kii taikniken shaamil hai
 Other spun groups include self-defense techniques with more difficult methods
 judo ke siddhanton or prashikshan ke tareekon ke vibhinn pahaluon se aatmaraksha main madadgaar sabit hone vaale gunon or kaushalon ko badhaava miltaa he: However, there are some criticisms about the use of judo for self-defense training: apane ne-waja / guttham-gutthi or tachi-waja / khadey hokar guttham-gutthi ke gyaan kaa istemaal karne judo abhyaasakartaaon ne mishrit marshall arts maichon main bhi pratispardhaa kii he
 Former Russian national judo champion Fedor Emelianenko is often given the number one heavyweight status of mixed martial arts in the world
 kaaro parisian ek judo abhyaasakarta he jisane uafasi main safaltaapurvak ladaai kii
 Ramiyu Thieri Sokudju, Kazuhiro Nakamura and Olympic gold medal recipient Hideko Yoshida were the now-defunct Pride FC fighters

 purv dablyuisi midilwet champion paolo philho ne judo or jiu-jitsu ko apni safalataa kaa shrey diya he
 Fighters such as Sane Kikuta and Hayato Sakurai also belong to judo backgrounds, and a former UFC champion named Don Fry was a practicing judoka who was heard saying that judo is one of his official fighting styles
 shinia aoki, jo aaj duniya ke sheersh teen halke vajan vaale mishrit marshall arts abhyaasakartaaon main se ek he, kii bhi prishthbhumi judo main hi he
 Satoshi Ishii, the recipient of the 2008 Olympic gold medal, has retired from judo for full-time competition in MMA
 unhone japani pramotion cengoku ke saath anubandh par hastakshar kiya he
 Other notable MMA fighters wearing black belts in judo include: kaano jigoro kaa kodocan judo, judo kii sabase lokapriy or prasiddh style he, lekin yahi ek akeli style nahin he
 Both the words judo and jujutsu were quite interchangeable in the early years, so either because of this or simply to distinguish them from mainstream judo, some of these forms of judo are still known as jujutsu or jiu-jitsu
 kaano ke judo kii mul style se kai sambandhit roopon kaa vikaas hua he jinamein se kuch roopon ko ab kaaphi had tak alag kala mana jaataa he: Research shows that judo is a safer sport especially for young people, although adult competitive judo has more injuries than other non-confrontational or non-contact ball games, for example, but like other competitive contact sports Huh
 haalanki galaa ghontne kii takanic sambhawatah ek ghaatak takanic he lekin sahi tareeke se istemaal kiye gaye galaa ghontne kii takanic ke falswaroop pratidwandvi ke samarpan kar dene yaa behosh ho jane ke turant baad pratidwandvi ko is giraft se aaazaad kar dene par koi nuksaan nahin hota he
 The strangling technique used in judo is generally taught to more experienced judokas to help ensure the safety of students
 galaa ghonte rakhane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne kii suraksha ko pradarshit karne vaale paryaapt aankade uplabdh hai, or iske prashikshan ke samay apatkaaleen dekhbhaal or phir se hosh main laane kii takanic kaa bhi prashikshan diya jaataa he
 Controlled and properly, the opponent should also pay attention to protecting him from injury while hitting the ground
 haalanki kai paristhitiyon main chot lag sakati he, jaise - yadi jameen par patakane vaala pratidwandvi laaparvaahee se yaa jaanboojhkar jor se patakane ke baad patake jane vaale pratidwandvi par kud padataa he, yaa yadi tori uke ke jodon kii andekhi karte hue use laaparvaahee se jameen par patakata he 
 patakate samay chot lagane se bachaane kaa sabase acha tareeke ke rup main, pratiyogita main chaatro ke pravesh karne se pehle senseyi dwaara unhen sahi tarah se patakane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne ke liye acchhee tarah se abhyaas karana chahie jiske liye unhen "laayak banane" kaa abhyaas, purvavyavasthit tareekon or atyadhik parantu niyantrit evam paryvekshit mukt-abhyaas / mukkebaaji kaa abhyaas karana chahie
 The International Judo Federation is an international judo organization
 haalanki judo main iskaa koi aadhikarik aadhaar nahin he, lekin phir bhi international federation of associated raceling styles ), judo ko antarrashtriya str par abhyaas kiye jane vaale shaukia pratiyogtmak kushti ke chaar mukhya roopon main se ek ke rup main paribhaashit karata he 
 An active contestant may choose not to follow in order to get a higher rank and may choose to concentrate on preparing for the competition; For example, in the 2004 Paralympics a silver medal was won by an IQU female contestant named Lorena Pierce in the category weighing less than 70 kg
 gyaan or kshamta ke alaava, rank paane ke liye aam taur par ek nunatam aayu seemaa kii jarurat padati he
 Therefore, it is not a big deal to see teenager / teenager contestants in the national level competition who have been practicing judo for the last 10 years but due to being too young to qualify for a dan rank they only need blue belt ie a blue belt or brown belt means brown colored belt
 jab ek baar ek vyakti ko ek dan rank kaa ek str praapt ho jaataa he to alag-alag kaarnon se use aage bhi padonnat kiya ja saktaa he jisamen kushalta kaa str, pratiyogita kaa pradarshan or / yaa judo main yogadan, jaise - prashikshan or swayan seva samay, shaamil hai
 Therefore, a higher Dan rank does not necessarily mean that it has a better fighter
 judoka ko judo ke gyaan or kaushal ke anusaar rank diya jaataa he or unke rank kaa pataa unke belt ke rang se chalata he
 There are two divisions of rank: the "grade" of the level below the black belt and the "degree" of the level of the black belt
 This ranking system was introduced by Kano in martial arts and has been largely adopted by modern martial arts since then
 jab shuru-shuru main is ranking system ko banaaya gaya tha, us samay chaatro ke chah grad hote the jinhen bade se chote ke sankhyatmak kram main shreneet kiya jaataa tha or saath main pratham cu grad paane ke baad pehali degree ke blike belt kaa darja diya jaataa tha
 There are usually 10 dan ranks which are ranked in numerical order from small to large but according to the theory there is no limit to the number of dan ranks
 dasvin degree ke blike belt or usase upar ke darje ke liye koi aupchaarik aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Yukimitsu Kano, currently the grandson of Kano Jigoro, president of Kodokan, determines the individuals for promotion
 kodocan dwaara is rank ke liye keval pandrah vyaktiyon ko padonnat kiya gaya he
 On 6 January 2006, three people were simultaneously promoted to the 10th Dan: Toshiro Daigo, Ichiro Abe and Yoshimi Osawa
 It is the highest promotion awarded at the same time so far and is the first time in 22 years
 ab tak kisi ko bhi 10wein dan se oonche rank par padonnat nahin kiya gaya he, lekin: Although there should be uniformity in the ranks of dans among national organizations, there is considerable variation in QS grades as some countries are given higher QS grades than other countries

 Hemoglobin is also found outside the red blood cells and progenitor lines that produce them
 Other hemoglobin-containing cells include the A9 dopaminergic neuron, macrophage, alveolar cells, and mesangial cells of the kidneys of the substancia nigra
 The role of hemoglobin in these tissues is as an antioxidant and a regulator of iron metabolism, rather than oxygen transport

 Hemoglobin consists mostly of proteins and these proteins are made up of chains of amino acids
 These chains are linear in form, such as a written sentence containing letters or beads in a garland
 The variation in the types of amino acids in the protein chain of amines acids in all proteins determines the chemical properties and function of that protein
 The same applies to hemoglobin, in which a series of amino acids can affect important functions such as the attraction of proteins to oxygen

 In any one species, different types of hemoglobin are always present, although one chain is usually the most common in every species
 Differentiation of hemoglobin produces different types of hemoglobin protein genes
 There is no disease due to many of these deformed types
 But some malformed hemoglobins cause a group of genetic diseases called hemoglobinopathies
 Sickle cell disease is the most famous hemoglobinopathy, which is the first human disease, the process of which is understood at the molecular level
 In another group of diseases, thalassemia, small amounts of normal or sometimes abnormal hemoglobins are produced due to problems and pathologies of the globin gene control
 There is anemia in all these diseases

 Synthesis of hemoglobin occurs in a complex step chain
 Synthesis of the heme portion occurs in various steps in the mitochondria and cytosol of immature red blood cells, while the globin protein portions are synthesized by ribosomes in the cytosol
 Hemoglobin in the bone marrow is produced in the cell throughout the period of its early development from the proerythroblast to the reticulocyte stage
 At this time the nucleus of mammals' red blood cells disappears, but this does not happen in birds and many other species
 Despite the absence of a nucleus in mammals, the remaining ribosomal RNA produces hemoglobin until the reticulocyte's RNA is depleted after entering the bloodstream

 In most humans, the hemoglobin molecule is a group of four globular protein subunits
 Each subunit is made up of a protein chain tightly connected to a non-protein heme group
 Each protein chain is arranged in a globin fold arrangement as a set of interconnected alpha-helix conformational segments, as other heme / globin proteins such as myoglobin have the same folding motif-like arrangement
 There is a space in this folding pattern, which holds the heme group firmly

 The most common hemoglobin type in adult humans is a tetramer called hemoglobin A, which consists of two alpha and two beta subunits with non-covalent bonds composed of 141 and 146 amino acids, respectively
 This is indicated by α2β2
 These subunits are anatomically similar and approximately the same size
 The molecular weight of each subunit is about 17000 daltons and the total molar mass of the tetramer is about 68000 daltons
 In this way 1 g / dl = 0

 Deoxyhemoglobin is a type of hemoglobin devoid of bound oxygen
 The absorptive spectrum of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin is different
 Oxyhemoglobin has a much lower absorption of 660 nm wavelength than deoxyhemoglobin, while its absorption is slightly higher at 940 nm
 This is why the color of hemoglobin is red and that of deoxyhemoglobin is blue
 This variation is used to measure the amount of oxygen in the patient's blood by a device called pulse oximeter
 oxykrut haemoglobin kii oxikaran sthiti nishchit karnaa kathin he kyonki prayogic maapan se oxihemoglobin diamagnetic hoti he, phir bhi oxygen or louh donon main kam-urja vaali electron sanrachanaayen paramagnetic hoti hai 
 oxygen or usase sambandhit louh kii oxikaran dashaon ke nunatam-urja prakaar nimna hai: All these structures are paramagnetic, rather than diamagnetic
 Thus, in order to understand the observed diamagnetism and unpaired electrons, an uneven distribution of electrons in the combination of iron and oxygen is necessary
 diamagnetic echbi-otu ke utpaadan ke liye teen sambhaavnaaen hai: Straightforward information is tarah, echbi-otu main louh kii sabase najdiki aupchaarik sthiti oxikaran +3 dasha hoti he, jisamen oxygen -1 dasha main hoti he
 is sanrachana main diamagnetismo superaksaide par maujuud ekal ayugal electron ke louh par sthit ekal ayugal electron se pratiferomagnetic tareeke se vyavasthit hone se utpann hota he, jisase prayog ke diamagnetic oxihemoglobin ke anusaar, sari sanrachana ko koi kul spin nahin praapt hoti
 It is not surprising to find that the second of the three possibilities above for diaminagnetic oxyhemoglobin is found to be correct by experiment - both singlet oxygen and large splits of charge are unfavorable high-energy conditions
 Moving to a higher oxidation state of iron in HB-OTO reduces the size of amu, allowing it to move to the bottom of the peripherin ring, and initiating the allosteric changes observed in glabulines by pulling the coordinated histidine residue
 jaev-acarbonic rasayanagyon dwaara prastut praarambhik siddhanton ke anusaar sambhaavna san

 aisa isaliye lagata tha kyonki louh kii metahaemoglobin ke rup main oxikaran dasha III, jab 
O2- electron ko "pakadaney" ke liye superaksaide maujuud na ho, to haemoglobin ko hawa main maujuud saamaanya triplate O2 ko baandhne main aksham bana detii he
 isaliye yah maan liya gaya ki jab oxygen gas fefdon main bandhi hoti he, to louh Fe ke rup main rahata he
 is pehle vaale clasik model main louh kaa rasayanashastra lubhaavna tha, lekin diamagnetic ucch-urja singlate oxygen kii aavashyaktaa kabhi samaj main nahin ai
 yah tark diya gaya ki oxygen anu kaa bandhan ucch spin louh ko shashakt-kshetreey ligandon ke ek octahedral kshetra main rakh detaa he –kshetra main is parivartan se sphatik kshetra main vruddhi se urja kaa vibhaajan ho jaataa he, jisase louh ke electron jode banaakar kam-spin vaali sanrachana kaa nirmaan karte hai, jo Fe main diamagnetic hote hai
 yah jabaran kam-spin yugleekaran oxygen ke bandhane par hota he, lekin yah louh ke aakaar main parivartan ko samajhane ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 louh ke chote aakaar or badi hui oxikaran dasha, va oxygen ke kamjor band ko samajhane ke liye oxygen dwaara louh se ek atirikt electron ko nikaalnaa aavashyak he
 It should be kept in mind that the determination of the whole-number oxidation state is a formalism, since covalent bonds are not necessary for the bond sequences that are defective in complete electron-transfer
 In this way, all three models of paramagnetic HB-OTO may be responsible to some extent for the actual electronic structure of HB-OTU
 But Fe of iron model in HB-OTO seems more correct than Fe
 oxygen ligand ke atirikt, jo haemoglobin ko sahakaari rup se baandhe rakhata he, haemoglobin ligandon main spardhaatmak avarohak jaise, carbon monoaksaide va alostrik ligand jaise carbon dioxide bhi shaamil hai
 When oxygen is bound to the iron complex, it causes the iron atom to move towards the center of the porphyrin ring
 At the same time, the imidazole co-chain interacting with the second pole of the histidine residue is pulled towards the porphyrin ring
 This interaction causes the ring plane to tilt outward to the outside of the tetramer and also exert pressure in the protein helix containing histidine as it approaches the iron atom
 This pressure is transmitted to the rest of the three monomers of the tetramer, which causes similar changes in other heme sites and eases the binding of oxygen to these sites

 Oxygen binding is affected by molecules such as carbon monoxide
 CO heme competes with oxygen at the binding site
 The hemoglobin binding affinity of CO is 200 times greater than its oxygen affinity, meaning that small amounts of CO dramatically reduce hemoglobin's ability to carry oxygen
 When hemoglobin is combined with CO, it forms a very bright red compound called carboxyhemoglobin, which can cause the skin of a person with CO poisoning to look pink instead of white or blue after death
 When the exhaled air has levels as low as 0
02% of CO, headache and nausea occur, fainting occurs if the CO concentration is increased to 0
1%
 In heavy smokers, up to 20% of the active sites of oxygen may be blocked by CO

 ye sabhi hime main louh se uski oxikaran dasha ko badale bina bandhit hote hai, lekin oxygen bandhan ko avaruddha karte hai, jisase gambhir vishaaktata hoti he
 The iron atom of the heme group should initially be in the ferrous oxidation state for binding and transport of oxygen and other gases
 Initial oxidation in ferric condition without oxygen results in hemoglobin hemiglobin or methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen
 Normal red blood cells have a reduction mechanism to protect hemoglobin from such a condition
 Nitrogen dioxide and nitrous oxide have the potential to convert small amounts of hemoglobin to methemoglobin, but are generally not health-critical
 carbon daai oxide haemoglobin par ek bhinn bandhan sthal par sthit hoti he
 carbon daai oxide oxygenheen rakt main aasaani se ghul jaati he, jisase chayapachay karte utakon main oxygen ke pahunchane ke baad carbon daai oxide ko saralata se sharir ke baahar nikaala ja saktaa he

 anzime carbaanik enhydrage ke jariye carbon daai oxide pani se pratikriya karke carbaanik acid detii he, jo bicarbonate or protaanon main vighatit ho jaataa he - In this way, blood with high carbon dioxide has a lower ph
 Hemoglobin can bind protons and carbon dioxide, which leads to protein changes and release of oxygen
 Protons bind to the protein in many places, while carbon dioxide binds to the α-amino group
 Carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin
 The Bohr effect is a decrease in the affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen by binding of carbon dioxide and acid
 Conversely, when the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood are reduced, carbon dioxide and protons are released from hemoglobin, which increases the protein's affinity for oxygen
 bandhit kii hui oxygen ko haemoglobin dwaara mukt kiya janaa aavashyak hota he, varanaa uske bandhit hone kaa koi matlab hi nahin he

 In people adapted to high altitude climates, the concentration of 2,3-biphosphoglycerate increases in the blood, allowing these people to give higher amounts of oxygen to tissues in conditions of low oxygen stress
 This process, in which molecule y affects the binding of molecule x to transport molecule Z, is called heterotropic allosteric effect

 The hemoglobin also carries nitric oxide in the globin portion of the molecule
 This helps oxygen reach the periphery and control respiration
 NO is recurrently bound to a specific cysteine residue in globin
 This binding depends on the state of hemoglobin
 The S-nitrosylated hemoglobin obtained from it affects various no-related actions, such as duct inhibition, blood pressure, and respiration
 NO is not released into the cytoplasm of red blood cells but is transported out of them by an anion exchanger called AE1

 Different types of hemoglobin are a part of the normal development of the fetus and baby, but there may also be morbid deformable types of hemoglobin produced due to differences in genetics in a population

 Deficiency of hemoglobin may result in a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin molecules, such as in anemia, or a decrease in the ability of each molecule to bind oxygen at a partial pressure equal to oxygen
 Hemoglobinopathies can be the cause of both
 In any case, the lack of hemoglobin decreases the ability of the blood to carry oxygen
 In general, hemoglobin deficiency must be distinguished from a lack of oxygen in the blood, or a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, although both are involved in the causes of hypoxia

 Symptoms of anemia are caused by a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin, with or without a deficiency of red blood cells
 There are many reasons for anemia, although iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are the main reasons for this in the western world
 Since heme synthesis is reduced due to the absence of iron, red blood cells appear light red in color and smaller in size due to iron deficiency anemia
 Other anemia is rare
 In hemolysis the hemoglobin metabolism causes jaundice due to bilirubin, and the hemoglobin in the bloodstream can cause kidney failure

 Glycosylated hemoglobin is a type of hemoglobin that is combined with glucose
 Glucose is combined with hemoglobin throughout the life of red blood cells, which is about 120 days
 Glycosylated hemoglobin levels are measured for long-term control of type 2 diabetes
 Glycosylated hemoglobin levels in red blood cells are increased if ta2dm is not properly controlled
 Generally it should be around 4-5
9%
 7% for patients with T2DM, even when it is difficult
 It is advisable to keep less than 
9%
 Levels greater than 12% signify poor control of glycosylated hemoglobin, and 12%
 Exceeding levels is considered very bad control
 Patients whose glycosylated hemoglobin level is 7%
 The chances of complications arising from diabetes are greatly reduced
 ta2dm ke rogiyon ke glycosilated hamoglobin staron par do bhinn prakaar ke abhyaas kaaryakramon ke prabhaav ko parakhane ke liye ek shodh kiya gaya - In this investigation, total glucose control was measured as glycosylated hemoglobin

 Long-term control of blood glucose levels can be done by measuring the amount of hba1c
 Samples are needed to directly measure this, as blood sugar levels can vary greatly throughout the day
 hba1c is the result of the reaction of hemoglobin a to glucose
 hba1c is high when glucose is high
 As this reaction is slow, the ratio of hba1c represents the average of glucose levels in the blood over the half-life of red blood cells
 a ratio of 6
0 percent or less of hba1c is considered to be a good long-term control of glucose, while greater than 7
0 percent
 The level of is considered insufficient control
 This test is especially useful for patients with diabetes

 Many oxygen-transport and binding proteins are found in organisms throughout the animal and plant world
 Bacteria, protozoa, and mildew all contain hemoglobin-like proteins, whose known and expected roles include binding of gaseous ligands
 Since many of these proteins contain globin and heme portions, they are often called hemoglobin, even though their composition is not very different from vertebrate hemoglobin
it is often impossible to differentiate between myoglobin and hemoglobin, as some of these organisms do not have muscles
 Or, they have a recognizable distinct hemorrhagic system, but are not related to the transport of oxygen
 In all these groups, the gas-binding heme and globin-containing molecules are called hemoglobins
 In addition to the transport and detection of oxygen, they also perform the cleaning of O2 in NO, CO2, sulfide compounds, and anaerobic environments
 They also act as deoxidizing chlorinated materials, like heme-containing P450 enzymes and peroxidases

 One of the most common uses of hemoglobin in organisms is its use in giant tube worms, which can grow up to 2
4 meters long and live in marine volcanic vents
 These organisms contain bacteria weighing half the weight of the organism instead of the digestive tube
 These bacteria react to the vent's H2S and water's O2 to produce energy, which produces food from water and CO2
 The back end of these worms has a deep red fan-like structure, which spreads in water and absorbs CO2 for use as synthesized raw materials like H2S and O2 for bacteria and photosynthetic plants
 
 These compositions are bright-red due to the exceptionally complex hemoglobins present in them, which contain up to 144 globin chains, each containing the corresponding heme compositions

 Some non-erythroid cells contain hemoglobin
 In the brain, the A9 dopaminergic neuron of the Substantia nigra, the astrocyte of the cerebral cartex and hippocampus, and all mature oligodendrocytes are involved
 It is thought that these cells are homozygotic in brain hemoglobin oxygenated conditions
 It makes possible the storage of oxygen for the process, which A9DA does not Uranon is especially important for, as is required of them require more oxygen with high metabolism to produce energy
 In addition, A9 dopaminergic neurons are at particular risk, as they are under extremely intense oxidation pressure due to hydrogen peroxide produced by deoxygenation to dopamine made by selfoxidation and monoamine oxidase, and in which the ferrous iron reaction results in extremely toxic hydroxyl roots
 Is produced
 This may explain the risk of weathering of these cells in Parkinson's disease
 These cells deepen after death due to the presence of iron of hemoglobin in these cells, due to which the Latin name of these cells is named Substantia nigra

 Historically, the color of blood was associated with war, because the ancient Romans associated Mars with the God of War because of its orange-red color
 The color of Mars is due to the presence of iron-oxygen in its soil, but the red color of the blood is not due to the iron present in the hemoglobin and its oxides, which is a misnomer
 The red color is due to the porphyrin portion of hemoglobin, which binds iron, and not iron itself, although iron ligation and redox status may affect electronic changes and thus its optical properties
