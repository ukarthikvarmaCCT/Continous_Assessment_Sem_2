 saamaajik starikaran vah prakriya he jisame vyaktiyon ke samoohon ko unki pratishtha, sampatti or shakti kii maatra ke saapeksh padanukram main vibhinn shreniyon main ucch se nimna rup main stareekrut kiya jaataa he
 Classification is global and there are many reasons for its emergence as the bourgeoisie and the labor class are the product of industrialization; Different states of wealth give birth to the rich, middle and poor
 samajashaastra main samaajik starikaran kaa adhyayan ek mahatvapurn vishay he
 By studying various forms of society, it shows that each person has a different place in the way in which people are connected to each other
 doctor, shikshak, vyapaaree, meconic, engeenior, majdoor, police, nurse, payalat, driver
 These are all people associated with any profession, whose profession is different and due to those occupations their social status is also different
 isliye yah kaha jaataa he ki saamaajik str par bhinnata kisi bhi samaaj kii ek vishisht pahchaan he
 This variation is found in every society and sociologists have studied individuals associated with various social functions with the help of their specific concepts
 kisi vyakti kaa unchaa va nicha mana janaa us samaaj ke prachlit niyamon ke aadhaar par hota he
 All the rules of society are different, but even then, there are some theoretical grounds for giving a person a higher and lower place in the society, keeping in mind the theoretical basis, social studies are studied in sociology
 jahaan tak saamaajik starikaran kaa prashn he ise paribhaashit karte hue barger tathaa barger kaa maananaa tha ki saamaajik starikaran se samaaj main vyakti ko ek duusare se bhinn pahchaan hoti he jo saamaajik vargeekaran ke siddhanth par us samaaj main tikaa hota he
 Social stratification is the process of categorizing people
 vyakti jin vibhinn shreniyon main bante hote hai unhen str kehete he
 Kingsley Davis has said that when we think of caste, class and social stratification, our mind gets attention of the groups whose members hold a place in society
 uske aadhaar par unhen kuch pratishtha mili hoti he
 On the basis of this, the position of one group is considered to be legally different from the other group, it becomes the basis of social stratification
 jab ham varg par aadhaarit samaaj kii baat karte hai to yah kaha ja saktaa he ki varg-viheen samaaj kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati he
 It is said that there is no class in tribal society
 unka saamaajik sanghathan umr, ling tathaa naatedari par aadhaarit hota he parantu vah samaaj bhi jab jatil ho jaataa he or kuch log sampatti adhik kamakar apana sthaan unchaa bana lete hai to us samaaj main bhi starikaran kii pranali drushtigochar hone lagati he
 That is why Tom Batmore said that the division of class and category in society is a universal cause of any society based on power and prestige, which has influenced all social scientists
 penguin shabdkosh main saamaajik starikaran kii paribhaasha dete hue kaha he ki jab logon ko asamanta ke kuch pahaluon ko dhyaan main rakhkar shreneebaddh kiya jaataa he to is prakaar kii saamaajik vibhinnata ko saamaajik starikaran kaha jaataa he
 Thus, it can be said that the process of social stratification is not an abstract concept but it is a real social condition which has some characteristics that make one person, group, society, culture people from another person, group, society and culture Isolated and gives them social space under a higher and lower class hierarchy
 saamaajik starikaran ke maapdand va aadhaar sabhi samaaj main alag-alag hote hai parantu phir bhi yahan kuch maapdandon ke aadhaar par starikaran kii prakriya ko ek saarvbhaumik avadharana ke rup main samajhane kii koshish kii gayi he
 The following approach is discussed in the context of stratification
 broom tathaa seljanik ne uparyukt likhe teenon upaagam ke dwaara starikaran ko samajhaayaa he
 He believed that stratification could be studied by considering all three approaches as a method
 pratishthatmak upaagam main starikaran kaa adhyayan karte hue yah poocha ja saktaa he ki log apane aap ko kaise vargeekrut karte hai? kya maapdand prayog main laate hai? apni sthiti kaa akalan karne ke liye, un shrenee ko wo kaise dekhte hai or un maapdand ko kaise krambaddh karte hai? In the subjective approach, people are also asked how they assess themselves as compared to the other person or group or to the group they are part of
 samajashaastra main yah prashn poocha ja saktaa he ki aap kis varg se sambandhit he
 And on the basis of the answer to the question, the researcher can analyze that answer in a subjective way and try to find out what place that person, group give themselves
 vastunishth upagamamen shodhakartta nirikshin ke dwaara vastunishth tareeke se yah tay karne ki koshish karata he ki us vyakti kaa kya sthaan he
 Karl Marx tried to use this objective method to assess the class space based on the role a person plays in the production process
 marks ke alaava germany ke samajashaastra maiks webar ne bhi teen maapdandon ko mahatvapurn maanate hue use ek pramukh aadhaar maanakar samaaj kaa starikaran kiya- Max Weber believed that it might not be possible to separate the above three bases from each other and hence the combined form of these three should be looked at in order to assess the location of the person correctly
 nihsandeh in teenon aadhaaron kaa apana vishisht sthaan he or ye sabhi alag-alag tareeke se vyakti ke vyavhaar tathaa sthaan main nirdharak tatv ke rup main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Thus, it can be said that there may be differences among sociologists on how to study stratification
 But social stratification is a universal process, everyone accepts this and believes that in every society, a person or group is rated high and low, its status must be evaluated
 sabhi samaaj stareekrut samaaj hai
 But all these stratified societies can be quite different from each other as they all may have different stratification criteria
 saamaajik starikaran kii vyavastha kii vibhinn visheshtaon kaa varnan kiya ja saktaa he parantu prayek samaaj main ye visheshtaayen vibhinn prakaar se kaary karte hai or iske kaaran unki kriyaatmak kshamtaaon kaa adhyayan bhi un samaajon kii vishisht paristhiti ke sandanrbh main hi karnaa uchit hoga
 Their characteristics have been studied on the basis of social class, species, gender, birth and age
 ye sabhi tatv apana khaas mahatv us samaaj main rakhten hai
 For example, it can be said that in Indian society from birth itself, caste gets some special place
 agar ek vyakti kaa janm brahman parivaar main hota he to uskaa saamaajik sthaan unchaa ho jaataa he
 Similarly, if he is born in a low caste Harijan family, then his place is considered inferior
 isi prakaar stri kaa sthaan purushon ke apekshaakrit nimna str kaa mana jaataa he
 Whereas in tribal society, according to age, people have got higher positions and there is no lower position of women there
 isliye ek tatv agar kisi samaaj main starikaran ke mukhya aadhaar ban jate hai to vahi tatv duusare samaaj main zyada mahatv nahin rakhte
 But despite all this, there are some basic elements of social stratification that can be called structural basis
 ye tatv samaaj ke saarvbhaumik tathaa vishisht tatv maane jate hai
 There is also a consensus among sociologists about these basic elements 
 isliye sabhi samajashastriyon ne starikaran ke in swaroopon tathaa aadhaar kaa vishesh rup se ullekh bhi kiya he
 These main basic elements are samajashastriyon ne varg ko saamaajik starikaran kaa ek pramukh aadhaar mana he
 Although the name of the German sociology Karl Marx is particularly mentioned among the exponents of the theoretical approach associated with it, Max Weber's name is also notable with him, as he also described the important role of class
 in donon samajashastriyon ke saiddhanthik drushtikon ek duusare se kaaphi alag hai
 If there are any similarities in their studies, then only that both of them have studied the nature of industrial society in the context of capitalist society
 marks ne varg kii vyakhya aarthik sandarbh main kii he
 They believe that till date the history of human civilization has been the history of class struggle
 apni choti si pustak communist menifesto main unhone do virgon kii mahatvapurn bhoomika kaa varnan kiya he
 These are also two categories: unhone varg kaa varnan utpaadan ke sadhano par unke adhikaar ke sandarbh main kiya he
 He believed that along with the change in the means of production, two classes always remain - one class is the one who has control over the means of production and the other who is deprived of its ownership
 audyogic vikaas kii prakriya main audyogic samaaj main do varg spasht rup se dekhe ja sakate hai, ek varg puunjipati varg kehalaata he to doosraa majdoor varg
 Economic conditions are unfavorable to each other
 jahaan puunjipati varg utpaadan ke sadhano par ekadhikaar jamaa lene kii vajah se shoshak varg kii bhoomika nibhaataa he to vahiin duusari ore majdoor varg hota he jo utpaadan ke sadhano se vanchit rahata he tathaa uskaa shoshan puunjipati varg dwaara hota he
 The situation of these two is opposite to each other and due to their conflicting economic interests, there is a constant conflict between them
 vastav main poonjivadi vyavastha main in donon virgo ke bich aarthik swaarth ke bhinn hote hai
 Karl Marcus spoke of the social revolution by the concept of class struggle based on class consciousness
 starikaran ke najariye se dekha jaye to puunjipati varg tathaa majdoor varg donon ke saamaajik str paraspar alag-alag hai
 The bourgeoisie always reinforces its position by considering itself as high, while on the other hand, the working class always looks at the contradiction in the system of production of the bourgeoisie in order to elevate its position and in the profits earned by the capitalist to elevate its position Asks for his share
 webar ne bhi samaaj main varg ke aadhaar par aarthik str par matbhed dekha
 Weber said that the opportunities for the advancement of classes vary widely
 jahaan marks ne mukhya rup se do virgon kii baat kii he vahiin webar ne nimna chaar virgon kii baat kii hai- In the context of social stratification, Weber referred to another feature along with class, which was social honor or social status
 isliye webar ne varg ke sthaan par sthiti samooh shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 a square is a more open group than a closed group
 webar ke varnan se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki varg ko purnataya ek aarthik ikai na maanakar use audyogic samaaj se jodakar dekha janaa chahie
 TH Marshall has also interpreted the status group based on individual and status
 vyavsaay kii bhinnata ko dhyaan main rakhkar bhi sthiti samooh kaa vivechan kiya jaataa he
 Some sociologists have studied social mobility keeping in mind their occupational status
 vi0 parato ke anusaar abhijatya varg kii do shreniyon kaa varnan kiya ja saktaa he jo nimna hai- The social status of the ruling elite is completely different from the social status of the non-elite class
 ek kaa saamaajik starikaran main sthaan unchaa hota he jabaki duusare kaa nicha
 But Pareto believed that the situation of both always changes
 unhone chakree siddhanth ke rup main iskaa varnan kiya he
 Today, the status of the 'ruling elite' is strong, but its position will not always be strong, because those who are not able to come to power, they keep full vigil on those who remain in power and dominate them as they become weak
 
 unke siddhanth ko 'abhijatya varg kaa chakran siddhanth' kaha jaataa he
 Caste-based stratification is considered an element of understanding social status
 jab sthiti purnatah purv nirdhaarit ho jaati he, jisase vyakti jahaan janm letaa he usase uski saamaajik sthiti main parivarttan laana sarvatha asambhav ho to aisi sthiti main varg jati kaa rup le letaa he
 Supporting this statement by mcivor and Page, Kingsley Davis believed that when talking about the nature of stratification on the basis of caste, two types of situations are easily remembered and both of these conditions are: conferred Status and earned status
 starikaran ke sandarbh main yah kaha ja saktaa he ki jati shabd ke dwaara jo sthiti banati he use pradutt sthiti kaha jaataa he kyonki iske aadhaar par gatishilta nahin hoti he or isamen koi parivarttan nahin kiya ja saktaa jabaki iske viparit varg se jo sthiti vyakti ko milti he use badla ja saktaa he or isliye varg main zyada lacheelaapan hota he
 Therefore, sociology describes it as 'closed group', where the status of the person is permanently fixed while interpreting caste
 kingsle davis ne jati kii vyakhya karte hue yah mana he ki jati ke dwaara kuch gun hamen viraasat main miltaa he- arthath iske kaaran asamanta viraasat ke rup main miltaa he
 Thus he believed that two types of social system can be talked about - one inequality which is met by caste in succession and the other which is linked to equal opportunity on the basis of equality
 ye donon starikaran ko darshaate hai ek main ek vyakti kii vahi sthiti hoti he jo uske pita kii hoti he or duusare main vyakti vah sthiti praapt karata he jo uske pita kaa ho bhi saktaa he yaa nahin bhi
 The person works hard and creates the possibility of raising himself even further from his father's position
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki bhartiya jati vyavastha pehali sthiti kaa udhaaharan he jabaki duusari sthiti america varg par aadhaarit samaaj he jahaan mehnat va parishram se ek vyakti apane pita se unchaa sthaan praapt karata he
 It is appropriate to mention the following characteristics of a society based on caste- jahaan tak varg or jati par aadhaarit saamaajik starikaran kaa prashn he- aisi manyata he ki jati tathaa varg ko lekar jo pehle sankeern drushtikon tha usamen kaaphi badlaav aayaa he
 Indian sociology believes that there has been a lot of change in the structure of caste and today the form we see in caste has changed a lot
 ke0em sharma kaa kahana he ki varg par aadhaarit antar, jati main prachur maatra main paaya jaataa he
 The people living in the village sometimes represent the Indian class structure
 isliye unka mat tha ki jati or varg ko ek duusare kaa virdohi swaroop nahin samajhnaa chahie
 These two are inseparable aspects of the Indian social system and there is a deep connection between these two whose continuity and altered nature needs to be studied
 jati or varg ke bich ke sambandh kii vyakhya karte hue yogendra singh ne kaha he ki jati tathaa varg bhartiya samaaj ke sanrachanaatmak tatv kaa hi pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Classes function only within the framework of caste
 em en shrinivas ne bhi is baat par zyada bal diya he ki jati tathaa varg ke bich ke sambandh ko keval gramin tathaa shahari samaaj or shiksha se jude suvidhaon ko praapt karne tak hi simit nahin rakhana chahie
 Its role should also be seen in the field of bureaucracy, labor union, political parties, urbanization and economic development only then its changed form and continuity can be understood
 aaj aadhunikeekaran kii prakriya main jati kaa aadhunik swaroop ek samiti ke rup main ubharne laga he or jati apane aap ko paramparaagat sanrachanaon tathaa saanskrithik tatwon tak hi simit rahane ke bajaay aadhunik yug ke naye ubharate samooh tathaa samitiyon kaa bhi abhinn ang banataa ja rahaa he or is prakaar naye sambandh viksit ho rahen hai or jati tathaa varg ke aapasi sambandh kaaphi gahare ho gayi hai isliye inke is sammilit swaroop kii pahchaan ko naye tareeke se adhyayan karne kii jarurat he

 Emanuel Kant was a German scientist, ethicist and philosopher
 uskaa vaigyanik mat "kaant-laplas pariklpana" ke naam se vikhyath he
 According to the above hypothesis, the solar system originated from the Saturn Vapor Nebula
 kaant kaa naitik mat "naitik shuddhta" kaa siddhant, "kartavya ke liye kartavya" kaa siddhant athwa "kathoratavaad" kaha jaataa he
 His philosophical view is known as "critical philosophy"
 emanuele kaant apane is prachaar se prasiddh huye ki manushya ko aise karm or kathan karne chahiyein jo agar sabhi karen to ve manushyata ke liye achche hon
 Emanuel Kant was born on April 22, 1724 AD, in the city of Königüzburg, under the East Provinces of Germany
 koniguzaberg shahar aaj rus main he or ab iskaa naam kalininograd Kaliningrad he
 His early education was under the supervision of his mother, who was greatly influenced by the religious movement called the "holy Way" of his time
 atev, alpaayu main hi vah dharmanumodith aacharan, saral, suvyavasthit evam adhyavsypurna jivan main ruchi rakhane laga tha
 At the age of 16, after completing his education at the "collegium Pheidrichianum", he entered the University of Königsberg, where for six years he studied physics, mathematics, philosophy and theology
 vishvavidhyalay chhodane ke baad kaant nau varshon ke liye, konigsburg se 60 mile dur, judsken naamak gaanv main chalaa gaya
 There he taught his livelihood in two families and continued his self-study in physics and philosophy
 is bich uske bahut se lekh tathaa laghugranth prakashit hue, jinamein se do–"jivit shaktiyon ke uchit anumaan par vichaar" tathaa "saamaanya prakritik itihaas evam akashasambandhi siddhant" vishesh ullekh hai
 In the first of these publications, he attempted to coordinate the ideas of power of Rene Dacart and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz, and in the second the mechanical and objectivist ideas of Newton and Leibnitz, and in the second, the mechanical and purposive ideas of Newton and Leibnitz
 usne "doctor legence" kii oopaadhi ke nimitt aavashyak prabandh bhi 1755 i
 main prastut kar diya tha or konigsburg vishvavidhyalay ne use ukt oopaadhi pradaan kar uski yogyata pramanit kii thi
 But there was no change in his personal problems
 vishvavidhyalay ne uske nau varsh ke parishram se prasann hokar use vishisht vyaakhyaata niyukt kar liya tha, kintu is kaary ke liye use vetan kuch bhi nahin miltaa tha
 Kant, despite odd circumstances, served the university unpaid until 1766 AD
 1758 i
 main usne tark or darshan ke mukhya adhyaaapak pad ke liye prarthana kii thi, kintu vah asafal rahaa
 In 1766 AD, he was appointed Assistant Library Manager along with teaching and now he got ten pounds annual salary
 chaar varshon tak kaant ne is rup main bhi kaary kiya, kintu usne adhyayan chintan or lekhan kaary jari rakhaa
 After being appointed "private Dozant", by 1770 AD, five of his epics were published - uparyukt granthon ke sheershakon se pataa chalata he ki 1755 or 1770 i
 ke bich kaa samay kaant ke vichaaron ke nirmaan kaa tha
 His thinking appears to have developed in a systematic way with the Latin installation paper published in 1770 AD - "the Shapes and Principles of World's Understanding and Wisdom"
 isi varsh, vah konigsburg vishvavidhyalay main tark or darshan ke usee adhyaaapak pad par niyukt hua, jiske liai use 12 varsh purv niraash hona padaa tha
 He had already become worry-free as he was getting 60 pounds annual salary
 un dinon itnaa vetan sammanit adhyapakon ko hi diya jaataa tha
 The publication of texts also did not yield any large amount of money
 apane "critic ov pyor rizan" se kaant ko keval 30 pound aay hui thi
 But, not aspiring for material comforts, till 1796 AD, he was actively striving for the growth of knowledge of the world
 in 26 varshon main se aadi ke 12 varsh usne keval ek pustak ""shuddh buddhi kii samiksha" ke likhane main vyateet kiye
 The above book was published in 1781 AD
 kaant ke praudh granthon main yah sarvshereshth darshanik granth mana jaataa he
 Other texts of this period include "the Role of Every Future Philosophy", "the Background of Ethics", "the Philosophical Foundations of Natural Science", "review of Practical Wisdom", "review of Judgment", "religion Limited Only by Wisdom", and " On eternal peace "
 1796 i
 ke baad bhi vah adhyayan, chintan evam lekhan main vyast rahaa kintu uske jivan ke ye aath varsh badi dayaneey dasha main vyateet hue
 His memory had become so weak that he had to remember even by writing small things
 swayan apane ghar kii dekhbhaal karne kii shakti usamen nahin thi; vivaah usne kiya nahin tha, kintu 42 varsh ke adhyaapan kaal main usne apane sahyogiyon evam vidhyaarthiyon par acha prabhaav daalaa tha
 Therefore, he received a lot of support and sympathy from friends and disciples in the last part of his life
 san 1801 i
 ke baad to vah bahut hi ashakt ho gaya tha, kintu antim teen varshon main vesiyaanski naamak uske shishy ne saath rahakar ahernish uski dekhbhaal kii
 Surprisingly, there are seven texts of Kant written in this period - "nitidarshan", "philosophical Foundations of the Theory of Moral Merit", "maanas shaktiyon kaa antvirodh,, "anthropology in practical terms", "tarkshastra, "bhautik bhugol" tathaa "shikshashastra" 
 After doing so much work, he died on 12 February 1804 in Königsberg
 kaant kaa vyaktigat jivan atal niyamon se jakadaaa hua tha
 From dawn to dusk, all his works were done at certain times
 bhojan ke samay ke sanlap ke bhi niyam the
 Most of the Western philosophers have been wandering, but Kant went more than sixty miles from his city in his lifetime
 phir bhi uskaa drushtikon sankuchit na tha
 He was not merely an intellectual thinker, he gave his philosophical ideas a place in life like Socrates and Pythagoras
 hine naamak german kavi ne kaant ke darshanik jivan kii prashansa main aisi baaten kahi hai jo use sanakee siddh karti hai, kintu, uske vichaaron ne uttarvarti darshan ko itnaa prabhavit kiya ki kaant ke adhyeta use darshan main ek naveen yug kaa pravartak maanate hai

 unki aalochana prakriya main keval sahitya hi nahin hota, balki ve samaaj, arth, raajnneeti, itihaas ko ek saath lekar sahitya kaa moolyankan karte hai
 Like other critics, he has not evaluated a creator merely to test his writing skills, but his criterion of how judged the creator has been over his time

 iske saath hi ve yah prayaas karte hai ki pashchim asia ke vartmaan nivaasiyon kii aankhon se unki pracheen samskruti kaa vah paksh ojhal rahe, jiskaa sambandh bharat se he
 First of all, Indians have to understand this relationship, then they have to explain it to their neighbors
 bhukhmaree, ashiksha, andhvishwaas or nae-nae rog failaane vaali vartmaan samaaj vyavastha ko badalanaa he
 This requires a concerted effort by India and its neighbors
 yah prayaas jab bhi ho, yah anivaary he ki tab padosiyon se hamaare vartmaan sambandh badalenge or unke badalane ke saath ve or ham apane puraane sambandhon ko nae sire se pahachaanenge
 The scientific, objective interpretation of the past is associated with the question of the reorganization of the present society

 They consider Indian history written by the British to be a conspiracy
 unka kahana he ki yadi bharat ke itihaas kaa sahi-sahi moolyankan karnaa he to hamen apane pracheen granthon kaa adhyayan karnaa hoga
 The British have deliberately destroyed Indian history
 aisa karke hi ve is mahaan raashtra par raaj kar sakate the
 The deeper manifestation of the separation of caste and religion prevalent in India after the arrival of the British, the impact is not as deep in the history
 samaaj ko baantkar hi angrej is mahaan raashtra par shashan kar sakate the or unhone vahi kiya bhi he
 He never accepted the awards received

 In a remote village in France, Balian, a blacksmith, was suffering from the recent suicide of his wife
 dharmayoddhaon kaa ek samooh chote se gaanv main aata he or unamem se ek ne swayan ko baalion kaa pita, ibelin kaa baron godfre, ke rup main parichay dekar baalion se sampark kiya
 Godfrey asks Balian to return to Jerusalem with him
 baalion ne manaa kar detaa he or dharmayoddha laut jate hai
 Later, Balian's half-brother, the priest of the city, told that he had ordered the head of Balian's wife to be cut off before burial
 tab baalion ne janaa ki uskaa bhai usee cross ko pehla he jo uski patni dafan kiye jane ke pehle pahani thi
 Balian killed his brother in anger, retrieved the cross and fled the village
 baalion ne jerushlem ke shahar main apane or apni patni ke kshamaprarthana or paapon se mochan ke liye apane pita kaa pataa lagaaya
 After meeting his father, soldiers led by Godfrey's nephew, naturally, arrest Balian
 In reality, the nephew's desire was to kill both Balian and Godfrey so that his father, and indeed he, could attain the rank of Baron of Godfrey
 godfrey ne baalion ko saunpane se inkaar kar diya or tab bhattije ne waapas hon kaa naatak kiya or turant godfrey or uske aadamiyo ke khilaaf chupake se akraman kar diya
 Later all the nephew fighting men were killed and two of Godfrey's men were killed
 godfrey ne apane bhaagate hue bhattije kaa peechha kiya or use maar daalaa
 During the chase, an arrow pierced his body when he swung a sword to kill his nephew

 On Balian's journey to Jerusalem, his ship overturns and is trapped in a storm in which Balian and his horse survive
 jab baalion ne ghode ko dhvanshavshesh se mukt hi kiya tha ki vah ghabrahat main bhaag jaataa he
 Upon discovering the horse in the desert, Balian encounters a Muslim horseman and his servant
 ghode ke adhikaar par ek ladaai hui or baalion ne akraman karne par ghudsavaar ko anichhaa se maar daalaa lekin naukar ko chhod diya or usase jerushlem kaa maargdarshan karne ko kaha
 jerushlem main unke aagaman par, baalion ne naukar ko ghode de diya or use mukt kar diya
 aadmi ne bataaya ki uskaa maaraa gaya maalik sarasans ke bich mahatvapurn nite tha or uske krity use unase sammaan or prasiddhi dilaayenge
 After he was accepted as the new owner of Ibelin by Godfrey's followers, Balian soon became acquainted with the main players of Jerusalem's political landscape: Tiberius, the leper king Baldwin IV, the head of Jerusalem, Princess Sibylla, the king's sister, and her Husband Gu de Lucignan, who supported anti-muslim activities of the dastardly group similar to the Emperor Templar

 Riley Smith further commented that "such idiocy will advance existing myths", arguing that the film is now based on the romanticized views of Sir Walter Scott's book, The Talisma, published in 1825 rejected by academics " Fellow Crusade historian Jonathan Phillips also spoke out against the film

 * mejabaan desh Aluminum is a chemical element found in metallization
 yah bhuparpati main sabase adhik maatra main pai jane vaali dhaatu he
 One major ore of aluminum is - Bauxite
 yah mukhya rup se aluminium oxaid, aayran aksaid tathaa kuch anya ashuddhiyon se milakar bana hota he
 These impurities are removed by the Bayer process, leaving only alumina
 alumina se vidyut apghaton dwaara shuddh aluminium praapt hota he
 Aluminum metal is the conductor of heat and heat and is very light
 iske kaaran iskaa upyog hawaii jahaaj ke purjon ko banane main kiya jaataa he
 In India, huge deposits of boxite are found in Jammu and Kashmir, Mumbai, Kolhapur, Jabalpur, Ranchi, Sonbhadra, Balaghat and Katni
 urisa sthit nalko duniya kii sabase sasti aluminium banane vaali company he
 Aluminum is a white colored metal

 Kankshi, Tuvari and Saurashtra are its old names
 fitkaree vastut: potacium salphet or aluminium salphet in donon kaa dvigun yogic he
 In 1754, Margraf demonstrated that the soil called alumina is different from lime
 sar hanferi davy ne san 1807 hi main alumia mitti se dhaatu pruthak karne kaa praytn kiya, parantu safalataa na mili
 In 1825, Arstad heated aluminum chloride with potassium content and then distilled the mercury
 aisa karne par jo churna sa batch rahaa usamen dhaatu kii chamak thi
 This metal is called aluminum
 san 1845 main frederick vohalar ne is dhaatu ke taiyaar karne main potacium dhaatu kaa prayog apchaayak ke rup main kiya
 He found some small particles of this metal, after examining which he told that this new metal is very light and its wires can be pulled
 tadnantar sodium or sodium aluminium chloride kaa prayog karke san 1854 main devil ne is dhaatu kii acchhee maatra taiyaar kii
 Being a new metal at that time, aluminum was counted among precious metals and was used in decorations and ornaments
 san 1886 main ohayo nagar main chalrs martin haul ne gale hue cryolite main alumina ghola or usamen se vidyudvishleshan vidhi dwaara aluminium dhaatu pruthak kii
 In the same year in Europe also, HERO independently made this metal in this way
 yahi haul-hero-vidhi aajkal is dhaatu ke utpaadan main vyavahrut ho rahi he
 Since it is lighter and cheaper, the prevalence of aluminum and alloys has been increasing since then
 aluminium dhaatu taiyaar karne ke liye do khanijon kaa vishesh upyog hota he
 One is bauxite and cryolite
 bauksite ke vistrut nikshep bharat main ranchi, palamu, jabalpur, balaghat, selem, belgaum, kolhapur, thana aadi jilon main paae gaye hai
 The permitted quantity of this mineral in this country is 28 million tonnes
 aluminium dhaatu taiyaar karne ke nirmitt pehla praytn yah kiya jaataa he ki bauksite se shuddh alumina mili
 a method of purification of bauxite is named after the Bayer method
 isamen bauksite ko garam castic soda ke vilyan ke saath abhikrut karke sodium aluminute bana lete hai
 This aluminate solution is filtered and the alumina is precipitated from it
 
 Aluminum metal from alumina is prepared by hall-hero method
 vidyudvishleshan ke liye jis cell kaa prayog kiya jaataa he vah ispaat kaa bana ek bada baksaa hota he, jiske bheetar carbon kaa astr laga rahata he
 This lining of carbon is prepared by heating a mixture of coke, pitch and coal tar
 isi prakaar carbon ke dhanagar bhi taiyaar kiye jate hai
 They are often 12–20 inches long rectangular
 ye dhanagar ek samvahak dand se latakate rahete hai or icchaanusaar upar neeche kiye ja sakate hai
 The electrolytes carry the dissolved cryolite inside the cell and the electromagnet controls such that the cryolite remains in an evenly damped state by the heat of its flow
 vidyudvishleshan hone par jo aluminium dhaatu banati he vah cryolite se baari hoti he, at: cell main neeche baith jaati he
 This metal acts as a minus
 gali hui dhaatu samay-samay par cell main se baahar baha lee jaati he
 Alumina is added in the cell as needed
 cryolite ke galnaank ko kam karne ke liye isamen bahudhaa thodaa sa calcium floride bhi mila dete hai
 It is notable that the success of an aluminum metal factory depends on cheap electricity

 Water does not affect the pure metal, but in the presence of copper, brass or other metals, the effect of water is also sufficient
 carbon athwa carbon ke oxide unche taap par dhaatu ko carbide main parinat kar dete hai
 In the presence of mercury and moisture, the metal becomes hydroxide
 yadi aluminium churna or sodium paraksaide ke mishran par pani kii kuch hi boonden paden, to jor kaa visphot hoga
 a mixture of aluminum powder and potassium permanganate gives intense light when burned
