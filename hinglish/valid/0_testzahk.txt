 The amplifier made of bipolar transistors has to be fitted properly, only then it can function as expected otherwise a variety of problems may occur
 bijetti ko abhinath karne ke liye kai tarah ke network prayog kiye jate hai, jinaki apni-apane gundosh hai
 Amplifiers constructed from different bjts are often characterized with the help of different configurations of resistors, whereas integrated circuits use a more advanced inductance than this

 The 'operating point' of a transistor means the DC collector-emitter voltage and collector current of the transistor when the input signal is not in place
 ise 'bis-bindu', 'quicent bindu' yaa 'kyuu-bindu' bhi kehete hai
 The following inductance circuits are mainly used to introduce transistor amplifiers into class-a
 is abhinati ko 'base bis' athwa 'phixd registeens bis' bhi kehete hai
 The front diagram uses the same DC supply for both the collector and the base, but two different supplies can also be used
 is chitra ke sandarbh main- Hence, For a given transistor, Vbe does not vary significantly during use
 As Vcc is of fixed value, on selection of Rb, the base current Ib is fixed
 Therefore, this type is called fixed bias type of circuit
 Also for given circuit, Therefore, The common-emitter current gain of a transistor is an important parameter in circuit design, and is specified on the data sheet for a particular transistor
 It is denoted as β on this page
 atah we can obtain Ic as well
 In this manner, the operating point given as can be set for given transistor
 laabh: Advantage: upyog: Due to the above inherent drawbacks, fixed bias is rarely used in linear circuits
 Instead, it is often used in circuits where transistor is used as a switch
 However, one application of fixed bias is to achieve crude automatic gain control in the transistor by feeding the base resistor from a DC signal derived from the AC output of a later stage
 This configuration employs negative feedback to prevent thermal runaway and stabilize the operating point
 In this form of biasing, the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{b}}} is connected to the collector instead of connecting it to the DC source v cc { \ displaystyle V_{ \ text{cc}}} 
 So any thermal runaway will induce a voltage drop across the r c { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{c}}} resistor that will throttle the transistor's base current
 From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage VR b { \ displaystyle v _ {{ \ text {R}} _ { \ text {b xxrep 4 } across the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {b}}} is By the ebers–moll model, i c = β i b { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{c}}= \ beta I_{ \ text{b}}}, and so From Ohm's law, the base current i b = VR b / r b { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {b}} = v _ {{ \ text {R}} _ { \ text {b}}} / r _ { \ text {b}}}, and so Hence, the base current i b { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{b}}} is If v be { \ displaystyle v _ { \ text {be}}} is held constant and temperature increases, then the collector current i c { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {c}}} increases
 However, a larger i c { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {c}}} causes the voltage drop across resistor r c { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {c}}} to increase, which in turn reduces the voltage VR b { \ displaystyle v _ {{ \ text {R}} _ { \ text {b xxrep 4 } across the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {b}}}
 a lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current i b { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {b}}}, which results in less collector current i c { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {c}}}
 Because an increase in collector current with temperature is opposed, the operating point is kept stable
 laabh: Advantage: which is the case when Usage: The negative feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier as seen from the base, which can be advantageous
 Due to the gain reduction from feedback, this biasing form is used only when the trade-off for stability is warranted
 The fixed bias circuit is modified by attaching an external resistor to the emitter
 This resistor introduces negative feedback that stabilizes the Q-point
 From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage across the base resistor is From Ohm's law, the base current is The way feedback controls the bias point is as follows
 If Vbe is held constant and temperature increases, emitter current increases
 However, a larger Ie increases the emitter voltage Ve = iere, which in turn reduces the voltage vrb across the base resistor
 a lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current, which results in less collector current because Ic = β Ib
 Collector current and emitter current are related by Ic = α Ie with α ≈ 1, so the increase in emitter current with temperature is opposed, and the operating point is kept stable
 Like, if the transistor is replaced by another, there may be a change in Ic
 By similar process as above, the change is negated and operating point kept stable
 For the given circuit, Advantages: The circuit has the tendency to stabilize operating point against changes in temperature and β-value
 Disadvantages: which is approximately the case if Use: The feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier when seen from the base, which can be advantageous
 Due to the above disadvantages, this type of biasing circuit is used only with careful consideration of the trade-offs involved
 collector-stabilized Biasing The voltage divider is formed using external resistors R1 and R2
 The voltage across R2 forward biases the emitter junction
 By proper selection of resistors R1 and R2, the operating point of the transistor can be made independent of β
 In this circuit, the voltage divider holds the base voltage fixed independent of base current provided the divider current is large compared to the base current
 However, even with a fixed base voltage, collector current varies with temperature so an emitter resistor is added to stabilize the Q-point, similar to the above circuits with emitter resistor
 The voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages by the use of resistors in certain patterns
 By manipulating the resistors in certain ways you can achieve more stable current levels without having β value affect it too much
 In this circuit the base voltage is given by: v b = { \ displaystyle V_{B}= \ } voltage across r 2 { \ displaystyle R_{2} \ } = v c c r 2 − i b r 1 r 2 { \ displaystyle =v_{cc}{ \ frac {r_{2}}{}}-i_{b}{ \ frac {R_{1}R_{2}}{}}} Also VB = v be + i e r e { \ displaystyle V_ {B} = V_ {be} + I_ {e} R_ {e} \ } For the given circuit, Benefit: alaabh: which is approximately the case if where R1 || R2 denotes the equivalent resistance of R1 and R2 connected in parallel
 Use: The circuit's stability and merits as above make it widely used for linear circuits
 The standard voltage divider circuit discussed above faces a drawback - AC feedback caused by resistor RE reduces the gain
 This can be avoided by placing a capacitor in parallel with Re, as shown in circuit diagram
 The result is that the DC operating point is well controlled, while the ac-gain is much higher, rather than the much lower value of r c / r e { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {c}} / r _ { \ text { e}}} without the capacitor
 When a split supply is available, this biasing circuit is the most effective, and provides zero bias voltage at the emitter or collector for load
 The negative supply Vee is used to forward-bias the emitter junction through Re
 The positive supply Vcc is used to reverse-bias the collector junction
 Only two resistors are necessary for the common collector stage and four resistors for the common emitter or common base stage
 We know that Vb − Ve = Vbe If Rb is small enough, base voltage will be approximately zero
 Therefore, emitter current is, Ie = / Re The operating point is independent of β if Re >> Rb / β Advantages: Disadvantages: This type can only be used when a split power supply is available
 Class b and AB amplifiers employ 2 active devices to cover the complete 360 deg of input signal flow
 Each transistor is therefore biased to perform over approximately 180 deg of the input signal
 Class b bias is when the collector current Ic with no signal is just organized
 class-ab bias is when the collector current Ic is about 1 / 4 of maximum possible value
the class-ab push – pull output amplifier circuit below could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier
 Q3 is a common emitter stage that provides amplification of the signal and the DC bias current through D1 and D2 to generate a bias voltage for the output devices
 The output pair are arranged in class-ab push–pull, also called a complementary pair
 The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized
 That is, the diodes push the output stage into class-ab mode 
 This design automatically stabilizes its operating point, since overall feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond
 The use of fixed diode bias requires the diodes to be both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors
 If the output transistors conduct too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage
 a common solution to help stabilize the output device operating point is to include some emitter resistors, typically an ohm or so
 Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amplifier

 Homosexuality refers to a person being sexually and romantically attracted to people of the same sex
 ve purush, jo anya purushon ke prati aakarshith hote he unhen "purush samalingi" yaa ge or jo mahila kisi anya mahila ke prati aakarshith hoti he use bhi ge kaha ja saktaa he lekin use aamtaur par "mahila samalingi" yaa lasbian kaha jaataa he
 People who are attracted to both women and men are called bisexual
 kul milakar samalangik, ubhaylangik or lingaparivartit logo ko milakar el ji bi tii samudaay banataa he
 It is hard to say how many people are gay
 samalangikta kaa astitv sabhi samskritiyon or deshon main paaya gaya he, yadhyapi kuch deshon kii sarkarein is baat kaa khandan karti he
 Although it can be said that the term homosexuality is used for people who are romantically attracted to people of the same sex, there are other definitions
 yadi koi samalangikta ko is arth main letaa he ki yah shabd keval un logo ke liye prayukt hota he jo samaan ling ke logon ke prati aakarshith hote hai, tab is paribhaasha ke anusaar kahin adhik log samalangik honge bajaay ki yadi koi samalangikta kaa arth keval yah samajhataa ho jisamen do samanlingi logon ke aapasi yon-sambandh he
 Typically, the term is used for all people who are attracted to the same sex, even for those who do not yet have homosexual sex
 baharhaal, samalangikta kaa sabase dikhaai dene vaala rup vaastavik sambandh he
 Most evidence of homosexuality in ancient cultures comes from paintings depicting two men in intimate relationships or sexual acts
 kuch log homophil or φιλεῖν ) shabd kaa bhi upyog karte hai
 This word is usually a "polite" word
 yah aamtaur par un logon ke liye prayukt hota he jo keval apane ling ke logon ke prati aakarshith hote hai, par jinke samalangik sambandh nahin he yaa wo samarth nahin hai
 Many words are used for homosexuals
 inamen se kuch kaa upyog samalangikon ko apamaanit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 However, the LGBT community sometimes uses these words to describe themselves
 yah in shabdon ko kam kshtakaari banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Some of the terms used for gay men are gay and queer
 samalangik mahilaon ke liye prayukt hone vaale kuch shabd hai lasbian or dike
 The term lasbian is mostly used
 dike kam upyog main aane vaala shabd he, jo kabhi-kabhi un lasbiyanon ke liye prayukt hota he, jo adhik purushon jaisi hoti hai 
 When gay people keep their sexual orientation a secret, they are said to be "in the closet"
 "khulaa" yaa "kothri se baahar" ek kathboli shabd he, jiskaa arth he ki koi samalangik vyakti apni langik prarthamikta ko lekar khulaa hua he
 This means that the person does not hide the fact of his homosexuality
 kuch samalangik log isliye apni langikta ko chhipate he ki ve sochate hai ki pataa lagane par na jane kya hoga yaa ve aise kshetra main rahete hai jo samalangikon ke liye surakshit nahin he
 Sometimes people who are "open" also say they are 'proud'
 "khulaa" yani ki ve apni langik prarthamikta ko nahin chipa rahe hai
 "proud" means that they are not ashamed of it
 "garv hona" yaa "garv karnaa", kaa algebiti samudaay main vishesh arth he
 This means that they are happy and celebrating their homosexuality
 iskaa arth "garv hona" hona nahin he, jaise unhonen koi aisa kaam kiya ho, lekin iskaa arth lajjit hone ke viparit he
 Many cities have "pride parades"
 pehle ye virodh pradarshan hua karte the, lekin aaj, inhen aamtaur par utsav manaane ke liye yojit kiya jaataa he or ye adhikanshtah june ke maheene main 1969 ke neuyork shahar main bhadke 'stonewal dangon' kii smriti main yojit hoti hai
 These riots occurred as a result of police harassing people when they were gay
 'stonewal' yaa 'stonewal dange' kabhi-kabhi algebiti adhikaar andolan kaa prarambh bhi maane jate hai
 The reasons for being gay and bisexual are disputed
 bahut se dharmon main samalangikta yaa ubhaylangikta ko paap mana jaataa he
 In some religions homosexuality or bisexuality is seen as choices that depend on a person's own choice
 parantu, bahut se aadhunik vaigyanikon dwaara darshaya gaya he ki samalangikta vikalp nahin he
 The factors of homosexuality are not yet clear, but the effects and environment of genetics and prenatal hormones are sometimes considered its factors
 vaigyanikon ne yah bhi darshaya he ki samalangikta keval manushyon main hi nahin balki bahut si pashu prajatiyon main bhi pai jaati he
 Homosexuality has also been found in many animals such as penguins, chimpanzees, and dolphins, some even as humans for a lifetime
 bahut se vaigyanik or chikitsak is baat par sahamat hai ki samalangik vyavhaar ko badla nahin ja saktaa he
 Homosexuals were treated by doctors assuming that it was a mental disease
 yadhyapi, ab bahut se deshon main samalangikta ko chikitsakon dwaara maansik rog kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 There are some religious communities, which are in the treatment of homosexuality
 ise 'riperrative chikitsa' kaha jaataa he
 In this type of therapy, many homosexuals have tried to make themselves heterosexual and they claim that they have changed, but many people do not believe that this is possible
 riperrative chikitsa kii bahut se chikitsa or manorog vigyaan samoohon dwaara ninda kii gai he, jaise america manovaigyanik sangh, america manorog sangh, royal manochikitsak mahavidhyalay, rashtriya saamaajik kaaryakarta sangh, royal nursing mahavidhyalay or america bal chikitsa academy
 These scientific and educated groups agree that sexual orientation or sexual orientation cannot be changed
 yah is baat par bhi sahamat hai ki riperrative chikitsa kaa samalangikon par aahatkaari prabhaav ho saktaa he
 Many people consider it unfortunate that without discussing the factors of heterosexuality, the factors of homosexuality and bisexuality are being discussed
 yadhyapi yah samajhnaa saral he ki vishamalangikta ke astitv kaa kya kaaran he, lekin yah is baat par prakaash nahin daalata ki samalangik logon ke mastishk kaa vikaas kis prakaar hota he
 Heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality are all reasons, and some believe that discussing only homosexuality and bisexuality suggests that there is something wrong with people with these types of sexual preferences

 bahut se deshon main samalangik apane jodidar se vaidhanik rup se vivaah nahin kar sakate
 However, they can have the same relationship as heterosexuals
 samalangik praayah ek duusare ko 'jodidar' yaa 'jivan-saathi' kehete he, bajaae ki 'pati' yaa 'patni' kehane ke
 They may have a 'commitment ceremony' rather than a matrimonial ceremony
 kuch samalangikon kaa vivaah samaaroh hota he, yadhyapi sarkaar dwaara ise manyata nahin di jaati yaa sweekaar nahin kiya jaataa
 They call their partner husband or wife, without worrying about the law
 par unke liye vivaah keval naam ke liye nahin he
 Married people have many benefits

 Some, but not all, benefits and benefits related to marriage are available under these provisions
 naagarik sangyojan yaa gharelu bhagidaari jaise praavdhaanon ko algebiti samudaay dwaara 'duusare darje' ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Gay couples do have some advantages in this, but they aim that these types of couples are not as important or legitimate as heterosexual couples
 kuch log to inaki tulana "alag lekin samaan" niyamon se bhi karte hai jinka upyog america main logon ko nasleey rup se pruthak karne ke liye kiya jaataa he

 samalangik yonkriya yaa ge sex use kehete hai jab samaan ling ke logon ke bich yon sambandh hon, chaahe ve do yaa do se adhik purush hon yaa mahilaayein
 Many religions consider homosexual sex as a sin, including Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity

 ankiy sanket bahut tarah ke ho sakate hai kintu binary digital sanket sabase adhik upyog main aate hai
 Zero / one, on / off, yes / no, low / high etc
 are some examples of binary signals
 jabase ekikrut paripathon kaa pradurbhaav hua he or ek choti si chip main lakhon karondon electronic yuktiyaan bhari jane lageen hai tab se digital electronic bahut mahatvapurn ho gayi he
 Modern personal computers and cell phones, digital cameras etc
 are the product of digital electronics
 ankiy electronic, yaa sookshmadvik aankik paddati aisi pranali he jo vidyut sanketon ko, rekhiy str ke ek nirantar pattiyon ke bajaae ek alag alag pattiyon kii shrinkhalaa ke rup main darshaati he
 All levels in this stripe indicate the same state of signals
 sanketo kii is pruthakta kii vajah se nirmaan sahansheeltaa ke kaadan rekhiy sanketo ke str main aaye apekshaakrit chote badlaav alag aavaran nahin chhodte he
 As a result, the circuit sensing the state of the signals ignores them
 zyaadaatar maamalon main sanketo kii avasthaa kii sankhya do hoti he or in do avasthaaon ko do voltage staron dwaara darshaya jaataa he: prayog main aapurti voltage ke aadhaar par ek va doosraa | 1 ucch str par hota he va 0 nimna str par
 Often these two levels are represented as "low" and "high"
 aankik takanic kaa mul laabh is tathy par aadhaarit he ki sanketo kii ek satat shrinkhalaa ko punarutpaadit karne ke bajaae, electronic upkaran ko sanketo kii 0 yaa 1 jaise kisi gyaat avasthaa main bhejnaa zyada aasaan hota he
 Digital electronics are generally made up of large combinations of logic gates and simple electronics of Boolean logic functions
 rekhiy paripath kii tulana main aankik paripath ko istemaal karne kii vajah iskaa ek laabh yah he ki shor ke kaaran sanketo kaa vighatan nahin hota he va unhen aasaani se bheja or darshaya ja saktaa he
 For example, a signal of a long sound made in the order of 1 and 0 can be reconstructed without error provided that the noise produced during the making of the signal is not so much that 1 and 0 cannot be detected
 
 sidi main ek ghante ke sangeet ko kareeb 60 lakh dwiadhari ankon ke rup main sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 In a digital system, more binary digits can be used to represent a more accurate signal
 haalanki is prakriya ke liye isamen adhik aankik paripath kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, chunki prayek ank ek hi prakaar ke hardware dwaara sambhala jaataa he natijatan ek aasaan maapneey tantra kaa nirmaan ho jaataa he
 An analog system requires a basic improvement in additional resolution linearity and a basic improvement in the noise characteristics of each phase of the signal chain
 computer niyantrit digital system ko software dwaara niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki hardware ko badale bina nae function ko jodne kii anumati detaa he
 And often this can be done outside the factory with the updated product software
 jisase utpaada ke dizin kii trutiyon ko graahak ke haath main utpaada ke aane ke baad sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Storage of information can be done easily in digital system as compared to analog
 digital system kaa shor pratiraksha vighatan ke bina data ko sangrahit or punah praapt karne kii anumati detaa he
 In an analog system, noise from old and discarded information is stored
 ek digital pranali main jab tak kul shorgul ek nishchit str se neeche he, jaankaree ko puri tarah se punah praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases digital circuits use more energy than analog circuits to do similar work and thus heat is generated
 portable yaa bydaree chaalit pranaaliyon main yah digital pranali ke upyog ko simit kar sakati he
 Battery-powered cellular telephones, for example, often use a low-power analog forearm to amplify and establish radio signals from the base station
 haalanki ek base stesan ke paas grid kii shakti hoti he or apekshit vidyut kaa prayog kar sakati he, lekin bahut lacheele software radio main
 is tarah ke base steshnon ke liye aasaani se nae cellular maanakon main prayukt sanket prakriya ko aasaani se riprogram kiya ja saktaa he
 Digital circuits are sometimes very expensive, especially in small quantities
 sanvedya jagat enlog ke hai or is jagat se sanket enlog matraaen hai
 For example light, temperature, sound, electrical conductivity, electrical and magnetic bases are analogs
 sabase upyogi digital system nirantar analog sanketon se digital sanketon ko alag karne ke liye badalanaa hoga
 This causes quantization errors
 agar system vaanchit degree kii vishwastata ke pratinidhitiv karne ke liye paryaapt digital data kaa bhandaaran karata he to parimanikaran truti ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The Nyquist – Shannon sampling theorem provides an important directive of how much digital data is required to accurately represent a defined analog signal
 kuch pranaaliyon main yadi digital data kaa ek bhaag lupt ho jaae yaa galat tareeke se vyavahrut hon, to sambandhit data ke vishaal khandon kaa arth puri tarah se badal saktaa he
 Because of the clef effect, it is difficult for users to tell if a specific system was right on the verge of failure or whether it can tolerate too much noise before it fails
 digital bhangshiltaa ko ek digital pranali ke roopankan dwaara majbootee ke liye kam kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, a parity bit or other error handling method can be inserted into the signal path
 yah paddati system ko, truti kaa pataa lagane main madad karti he or yaa to trutiyon ko sahi karti he yaa phir kam se kam data kii ek nai pratilipi ke liye puuchhati he
 State transition logic in a state machine can be designed to hold unused state and trigger a reset sequence or other routine error recovery
 ambeded software dizin immunity aware programing kaa prayog karata he, jaise avrodh nirdesh ke saath aprayukt kaarykram smriti ke rup main bharne kaa prayaas karata he jo truti ke punah prapti kaarykram kii ore sanket detaa he
 This helps protect against failures that can cause the microcontroller instruction to spoil the indicator, which might otherwise lead to the execution of random code
 digital smriti or sanchaaran pranali truti kaa pataa lagane or sudhaar jaise takneekon kaa istemaal sanchaaran or storage main kisi bhi truti ke sudhaar ke liye atirikt data kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 On the other hand in digital systems some techniques are used to make those systems' single bit errors more vulnerable
 ye takanic tabhi sweekaarya hote hai jab antarnihit bits un trutiyon ke nahin hone kii sambhaavna se kaaphi vishwasaneey hote hai
 Digital circuits are composed of analog components
 iske dizin se sunishchit hona chahie ki analog ghatakon ke lakshan icchit digital vyavhaar par haaavee naa hon
 digital system ko shorgul or samay margin, paraseete anugam or capcitance or filter bijli conection kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 Poor design leads to intermittent problems such as glitches, vanishing fast pulses that may trigger some logic but not others, "runt pulses" not reaching valid threshold voltages or a combination of unexpected logic states
 jab se digital circuit analog ghatakon se bana hai digital circuit lo-prisishan se bhi dhire gananaa karata he jo ek samaan spes or shakti kaa prayog karata he
 However the digital circuit will be able to assess repeatedly due to its high noise immunity
 On the other hand, analog circuits in high precision domains need more power and digital equivalent area
 ek digital circuit kaa nirmaan aksar logic gates kahe jane vaale chote se electronic circuit se kiya jaataa he
 Each logic gate represents the processes of Boolean logic
 logic get vidyut niyantrit switch kii ek vyavastha hoti he
 The output of a logic gate is an electric current or voltage that can control and bend most logic gates
 aksar logic gates unke aakaar, bijli kii khapat or laagat ko kam karne or unki vishwasaneeyata kii vruddhi karne ke liye sabase kam sankhya main transistor kaa upyog karata he
 Integrated circuits are the least important method of making large amounts of logic gates
 aam taur par ejiniyaron dwaara electronic dizin swachaalan software kaa upyog kar ekikrut circuit kaa dizin kiya hota he 
 Another form of digital circuit consists of lookup tables
 lukup talika, mashiinon par aadhaarit logic geton kii tarah hi kaary kar sakati hai lekin aasaani se taron ko badale bina hi riprogram kar sakati hai
 This means that designers can often repair design errors without changing the wiring arrangement
 isliye choti maatra main utpaada programeble logic divaais aksar adhimaanya samaadhaan kar rahe hai
 They are typically designed by engineers using electronic design automation software
 jab sanskaran madhyam se bade hote hai or tark dhime ho sakate hai yaa jatil elgoritham yaa anukram shaamil kiye jate hai, tab aksar ambeded pranali banane ke liye ek chota-se microcontrolar ko program kiya jaataa he
 These are usually programmed by software engineers
 jab keval ek digital circuit kii aavashyaktaa ho or isaki dizin puri tarah se customiod ho, tab fectory production line controlar ke liye paaramparik samaadhaan programeble logic controlar yaa PLC he
 These are typically programmed by electricians using logic ladders
 logic kriyaaon ko kam karne ke liye ejeeniyar kai tareekon ko apanaate hai, taaki circuit kii jatilta ko kam kiya ja sake
 When complexity is low, circuit errors and electronics are also less and hence they are less expensive
 ek CAD pranali ke bheetar aspreso hiuristic logic minumaizar kii tarah ek nunatam elgorithm sabase vyapak rup se istemaal kiya gaya sarleekaran he haalanki aitihaasik rup se dwiadhari nirnay rekhachitr ek swachaalit quine-mccluskey elgorithm, truth teble, karnog maanchitr or bulian bijganit kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Representations are important for the design of an engineer's digital circuit
 kuch vishleshan vidhiyaan keval vishesh pratinidhitiv ke saath kaam karti hai
 Representation of digital circuits with an equivalent set of logic gates is a classical method
 praayah kam se kam electronic ke saath electronic swichon ke samakaksh pranali kaa nirmaan ek doosraa tarika he 
 One of the easiest ways is to have a memory with only one table
 memory ke pate par input daale jate hai or memory ke data autput, autput ban jate hai
 These reports have digital file formats for automatic analysis that can be processed by computer programs
 adhikansh digital ejeeniyar anukool fil swaroop ke saath computer program ke chayan main saavdhaanee baratate hai
 Engineers consider the types of digital systems for reporting
 adhikansh digital system "sangyojan system" or "anukramik system" main vibhajit ho jate hai
 The input that is given in a combination system always gives the same output
 yah mul rup se logic prakriya ke set kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or jisaki charchaa pehle hi kii ja chuki he
 a sequential system is a combinatorial system with outputs inserted as inputs
 isse digital mashin opershan kaa kram se sanchaalan karata he
 The simplest sequential system is probably a flip flop, a mechanism that represents a binary digit or "bit"
 anukramik pranali ko aksar state mashin ke rup main dizin kiya jaataa he
 In this way engineers can design the aggregate behavior of a system and even test it in continuous simulation without considering the details of the logic processes without considering all the details of the logic functions
 anukramik system iske atirikt do upashreniyon main vibhajit hota he
 When a "clock" signal changes the state, the "synchronous" sequential system changes the state at once
 jab bhi input badalte hai "atulykaalik" anukramik pranali parivartan ko prasaarit karata he
 Synchronous sequential systems are characterized by asynchronous circuits such as flip flops, which make these changes only when the clock changes and in which the timing margin is carefully designed
 hameshaa kii tarah ek tulykaalik anukramik state mashin ko ek sangyojan logic main vibhajit karke lagu karne kaa vyaavhaarik tarika hota he or flip flop ke set ko "state register" kaha jaataa he
 Each time a clock gives a ticking signal and the state register captures the response generated from the previous state of the combinational logic and re-inserts it as the invariant input to the combinational part of the state machine
 sangyojan logic main samay ke khapat vaale adhikansh logic akalan dwaara ghadi kii sabase tej dar set hoti he
 The state register represents just one binary number
 agar state mashin main state bahut zyada hai to logic prakriya kuch sangyojan logic hote hai jo kai sankhya main state kaa utpaadan karti hai
 In comparison, the design of asynchronous systems is very difficult because the possible state must be considered at all possible times
 nunatam or adhiktam samay ke teble ke nirmaan ke sabase saamaanya vidhi ke anusaar isamen saare state vidyaman ho or vaise state ke minimise ke liye circuit ko samyojit kiya jaataa he or jo iske sabhi hisson ke susangat state main samay-samay par jane ke liye circuit ko baadhya kare
 aise saavdhaan dizin ke bina sanyogvash atulykaalik logic kaa utpaadan karnaa aasaan he jo "asthir" he or vaastavik electronics he jisamen apratyaashit parinaam hote hai kyonki electronic upkarnon ke mulyon main chote badlaavon kii vajah se sanchit vilamb hota he
 Some circuits are inherently asynchronous in their design and should be analyzed as such
 2005 ke rup main lagbhag sabhi digital mashine tulykaalik dizin hote hai kyonki tulykaalik dizin ko bananaa or satyapit karnaa bahut aasaan he-vartmaan main digital mashiinon kii nakal karne vaale softver, atulykaalik dizin ko nahin sambhalate
 tathaapi, atulykaalik tark ko behatar samajha jaataa he, yadi usase kaam nikaala ja sake to, kyonki uski gati ghadi dwaara manamaane dhang se gati simit nahin he, bajaay, yah un logic geton dwaara anumat gati par saamaanya rup se chalati he, jinase inkaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Constructing an asynchronous circuit using fast parts indirectly "runs" the circuit faster
 aam taur par, kai digital system, data pravaah mashine hai
 Often they are designed using synchronous register transfer logic and have been used as VHDL or Verilog hardware description languages
 register hastantaran logic main dwiadhari sankhya flip flop ke samoohon main sangrahit hai jise register kaha jaataa tha
 The output of each register is a bundle of wires called a "bus" that passes that number for other estimation
 yah akalan keval sangyojan logic kaa ek bhaag he
 Each estimation has a bus output and can be connected to multiple input registers
 kabhi-kabhi ek register ke paas inke input par bahusanketak hota he jisase yah kai bason main se kisi ek se nambar ko store kar saktaa he
 Alternatively the output of several things can be connected via buffers which can turn off the output of all devices except one
 input se prayek register ke naye data ko sweekaar karne par anukramik state mashin niyantran karata he
 In the 1980s some researchers found that almost all synchronous register-transfer machines could be converted to asynchronous designs using first-in-first-out synchronization logic
 is yojana main digital mashin, ek data pravaah ke ek set ke rup main pahachaani jaati he
 At each step of the flow, an asynchronous "synchronization circuit" determines when the output of that step is solid and gives a presented signal to "hold the data" to the stages in which the inputs to those stages are used
 iske liye kuch apekshaakrit saral tulykaalan circuit kii aavashyaktaa he
 The most general-purpose transfer-logic machine is a computer
 yah multah ek swat: binary abekas he
 The control unit of a computer is typically designed as a micro program run by a microsensor
 yah micro program ek player-piano role kii tarah hoti he
 Each table commands every bit of entry or "word" state of the micro program that controls the computer
 anukramak phir use ginati karata he or memory yaa sangyojan logic mashin main yah ginati sambodhit karata he jisamen micro program samahit hota he
 The bits from the microprogram control the arithmetic logic unit, memory and other parts of the computer, and the microservices itself
 is tarah computer ke niyantran kii digining ke jatil kaary ko apekshaakrit kaaphi saral logic mashiinon ke sangrah ke saral kaaryon main parivartit kar diya gaya
 Computer architecture is a specialized engineering activity that tries to classify registers, assessment logic, buses, and other parts of a computer in some way for the best purpose
 computer vaastukar ne laagat kam karne or gati ko teevr karne or computer programing trutiyon kii pratiraksha ke liye computer ke dizin main vrihad maatra main suprayog ko lagaaya he
 And its simple purpose is to reduce power in a fast battery powered computer system
 kai computer architech microprogrammers ke rup main vistrut prashikshuta kii seva de rahe hai
 "typical computers" are typically a traditional computer with a special purpose micro program
 mahange ejineering prayaason se bachane ke liye, badi logic mashiinon ke dizine banane ke prayaas kaaphi kuch swachaalit kar die gaye hai
 Computer programs are called "electronic design automation devices" or simply "EDA"
 logic kaa, saral truth teble-style kaa vivaran, aksar EDA ke saath ishtatam kiya jaataa he jo logic get kii ghatit pranaaliyon ko swatah utpaadit karata he yaa chote lukup teble ko, jo abhi bhi vaanchit parinaam dete hai
 The most common example of this type of software is the espresso heuristic logic minimizer
 vishaal logic pranaliyon ke anukulan ke liye adhikansh vyaavhaarik elgoridam, bijiy jodtod yaa dwiadhari nirnay aarekh kaa upyog karte hai or anuvanshik kalan vidhi or tapiya anukulan ke saath prayog, sambhaavna se bhare hai
 To automate costly engineering processes, some edas can take state tables that describe a state machine and can produce a truth table or a function table for a mixed part of a state machine
 state teble paath kaa ek tukdaa he jo prayek state ko paristhitiyon ke saath soochibaddh karata he, jo unke or sambandhit utpaadan sanketon ke bich sankraman ko niyantrit karata he
 It is common for function tables of such computer generated state machines to be optimized with the logic minimization software Minelog
 aksar, vaastavik logic pranaliyaan, up-pariyojnaon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke rup main dizin kii gai hoti hai, jinhen ek "upkaran pravaah" ke upyog se sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 The tool flow is usually a "script", a simple computer language that can implement software design tools in the correct order
 bade logic system ke liye upkaran pravaah, jaise microprocesar, hajaaron cmand lambey ho sakate hai or saikadon ejiniyaron ke kaam ko sanyojit karte hai
 Writing and debugging equipment flow is an established engineering specialty in companies producing digital design
 upkaran pravaah aam taur par ek vistrut computer fil yaa filon ke set main mit jaataa he jo yah varnan karata he ki kaise logic kaa bhautik rup se nirmaan karen
 This often includes transistor and wire drawing instructions on an integrated circuit or printed circuit board
 upkaran pravaah ke hisson ko, apekshit input ke khilaaf nakli logic ke output kii pushti karne ke dwaara dibag kiya jaataa he
 Testing equipment takes computer files with a set of inputs and outputs and highlights discrepancies between simulated behavior and expected behavior
 ek baar input data ko sahi maanane ke baad, khud dizine ko abhi bhi shuddhta ke liye satyapit kiya janaa chahie
 Some instrument flows confirm the design first by producing a design and then scanning the design to produce input data relevant to the instrument flow
 yadi scan kiya hua data, input data ke saath mail khaataa he, to upkaran pravaah ne shaayad koi trutiyaan pesh nahin kii
 Functional validation data, usually called "test vectors"
 kaaryaatmak pareekshan vector ko sangrakshit kiya ja saktaa he or kaarkaane main yah pareekshan karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he ki navnirmit logic sahi dhang se kaam karata he yaa nahin
 Functional test patterns, however, do not discover common construction mistakes
 Production tests, often designed by software tools, are called "test pattern generators"
 logic kii sanrachana kii jaanch or vyavasthit dhang se vishesh dosha ke liye test janit kar, ye pareekshan vector ko utpann karte hai
 In this way fault coverage can reach around 100%, provided the design is properly testable
 ek baar koi dizine maujuud he or satyapit or pareekshan yogya he, to ise utpaadit yogya hone ke liye aksar sansaadhit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In modern integrated circuits, the wavelength of light used to illuminate photoresistance has smaller characteristics
 utpaadakta software, expozar mask main mukt-paripath ko samaapt karne ke liye hastkshep pattern jodate hai or mask ke rizolution or contrast main vruddhi karte hai
 a large logic machine can have an astronomical number of possible states
 jaahir he, kaarkaane main, har state kaa pareekshan avyaavhaarik he agar har state ke pareekshan main ek microsecond lagata he or brahmad ke shuru hone se hi microsecond kii sankhya se kahin adhik state hai
 Unfortunately, this ridiculous case is typical
 saubhaahgya se, badi logic mashiinon ko lagbhag hameshaa chote logic mashiinon ke sangyojan ke rup main taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 To save time, small sub-machines are isolated by permanently installed "design for Test" circuitry and tested independently
 "scan dizin" naam kii ek aam pareekshan yojana, test bits ko kramik rup se ek yaa ek se adhik "scan chen" naam ke kramik shift register ke madhyam se hataati he
 In sequential scans, there are only one or two wires to carry the data and reduce the physical size and expenses of the frequently used test logic
 saare pareekshan ke baad, data bits jagah par hai, dizine ko "saamaanya mod" ke liye rikanfigure kiya jaataa he or ek yaa ek se adhik clock pulse ko lagu kiya jaataa hai, taaki dosha kaa pataa lag sake or pareekshan ke parinaam kaa pragrahan scan shift register main flip-flop main or / yaa leches main kiya jaataa he
 Finally, the test result is shifted to the block boundary and the forecast is compared against the "good machine" result
 ek board test paryaavaran main samanaantar testing ke kram ko, ek maanak "JTAG" ke saath aupchaarik rup diya gaya he 
 Another common test scheme provides a test mode that forces parts of the logic machine to enter a "probe cycle"

 The practicality of a system of digital logic determines many things
 fainout, gati, kam laagat or vishwasaneeyata kaa ek adarsh sangyojan praapt karne ke liye, ejiniyaron ne kai electronic upkarnon kaa nirikshan kiya
 The cost of a logic gate is significant
 1930 ke dashak main, praarambhik digital logic system, telephone riley se banaae jate the kyonki ye saste or apekshaakrit vishwasaneey the
 After that, engineers always used the cheapest available electronic switch, which could still meet the requirements

 With the increase of integrated circuits, reducing the absolute number of chips used introduced another way of saving costs
 ek diziner kaa lakshya sirf aasaan circuit bananaa nahin he, balki ghatak kii ginati kam rakhana he
 Sometimes this results in a slightly more complex design with respect to the underlying digital logic, but still reduces the number of components, board size, and even power consumption

 isi taratamya main kendriya hindi nideshaalay dwaara varsh 2003 main devanagari lipi tathaa hindi vartanee ke maanakeekaran ke liye akhil bhartiya sangoshtee kaa aayojan kiya tha
 In this seminar the following rules were laid down for standard Hindi spelling which has been implemented in the year 2012 as IS / IS 16500: 2012

 Many veterans have made their contribution towards standardization of Hindi spelling, out of which the names of Acharya Kishoridas Vajpayee and Acharya Ramchandra Varma are notable

 Accordingly, the Ministry of Education, Government of India appointed an Expert Committee in 1961 to determine the standard method of Hindi spelling

 The committee had four meetings in which after serious deliberation a rule regarding spelling was laid down

 In view of the ever increasing demand of this booklet, it was reprinted in the year 1989 and free distribution was made in various Hindi service institutions, offices, educational institutions to increase the use of standard form of Hindi in more and more institutions

 In the book "standardization of Devanagari script and Hindi spelling", the standard Hindi alphabet, standard Hindi spelling, punctuation, alphabets in lexicons, enhanced Devanagari script, etc
, are related to the division and subdivision of topics and paragraphs

 2
2
1 Signs of Hindi should be written separately from the primary in all noun words
 jaise :– ram ne, ram ko, ram se, stri kaa, stri se, seva main aadi
 In pronoun words, these signs should be written together with the phrase
 jaise :– tuune, aapane, tumse, usne, usko, usase, usapar aadi 
 2
2
2 If two factors are marked with the pronoun, the first of them should be combined and the second written separately
 jaise :– uske liye, isamen se
 2
2
3 If there is a collision between the pronoun and the causative mark 'he', 'even', etc
, the causative mark should be written separately
 jaise :– aap hi ke liye, mujh tak ko
 All conjunctive verbs should be written separately in joint verb terms
 jaise :– padhaa karata he, aa saktaa he, jaaya karata he, khaaya karata he, ja saktaa he, kar saktaa he, kiya karata tha, padhaa karata tha, khelaa karegaa, ghumta rahegaa, badhate chale ja rahe hai aadi

3 tatpurush samaas main hifan kaa prayog keval vahiin kiya jaae jahaan uske bina bhram hone kii sambhaavna ho, anyathaa nahin
 Such as: - Earth element
 saamanyat: tatpurush samaas main hifan lagane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Such as - Ramrajya, Rajkumar, Gangajal, villagers, suicide etc
 2
4
3
1 isi tarah yadi 'a-nikh' samast pad main hifan na lagaaya jaae to use 'anakh' padhe jane se 'krodh' kaa arth bhi nikal saktaa he
 a-nati: Anati, a-paras: Aperus, Geo-element: Bhootmata, etc
 is the same situation for all the posts
 ye sabhi yugma vartanee or arth donon drushtiyon se bhinn-bhinn shabd hai
 2
4
4 Hyphens can also be used to avoid difficult treaties
 jaise :– dwi-akshar, dwi-arthak aadi
 2
5

 are imprecise to explain many types of expressions
 kuch avyayon ke aage kaarak chihn bhi aate hai
 Like: - From now on, since, from here, from there, forever
 niyam ke anusaar avyay sadaa pruthak likhe jane chahie
 Such as: - For you only, till me, with you, full of cloth, country, overnight, all day, it should be so full, let me know, even work is not made, only fifty rupees etc
 2
5
3 sammanarthak 'shri' or 'ji' avyay bhi pruthak likhe jaaen
 Such as Shri Shri Ram, Kanhaiyalal ji, Mahatma ji etc
 2
5
4 samast padon main prati, maatr, yatha aadi avyay jodakar likhe jaaen 
 Such as - per day, percentage, man-man, constant, in due time, reasonably etc
 yah sarvavidit niyam he ki samaas na hone par samast pad ek mana jaataa he
 Therefore, it is relevant to write it together rather than writing it in busy form
 'das rupye maatr', 'maatr do vyakti' main padbandh kii rachana he
 It should be written separately only
 2
6
0 anuswaar vyanjan he or anunasikta swar kaa nasiky vikaar
 Both of these are also different in Hindi
 at hindi main anuswaar or anunasikta chihn donon hi prachlit rahenge
 2
6
1 reminders 2
6
1
1 sanskrit shabdon kaa anuswaar anyavargeey varnon se pehle yathavat rahegaa
 Such as - coincidence, protection, attachment, dialogue, kansa, violence etc

2 sanyukt vyanjan ke rup main jahaan pancham varna ke baad savargeey shesh chaar varnon main se koi varna ho to ekarupata or mudran / lekhan kii suvidha ke liye anuswaar kaa hi prayog karnaa chahie
 Such as - Pankaj, Ganga, Chanchal, Stingy, Kantha, Chill, Saint, Sandhya, Temple, Editor, Relations etc
 bandhani main rakhe hue rup sanskrit ke uddharanon main hi maanya honge
 It is advisable to use Bindi in Hindi
 2

3 yadi panchamakshar ke baad kisi anya varg kaa koi varna aae to panchamakshar anuswaar ke rup main parivartit nahin hoga
 Such as: - Eloquent, other, Chinmaya, oriented etc

2
1 Proper use of Chandrabindu in Hindi words will be mandatory
 2
6
2
2 anunasikta vyanjan nahin he, swaron kaa dhvanigun he
 In the pronunciation of resonant vowels, air also comes out of the nose
 jaise :– aan, uun, en, maan, hoon, aaen
 2
6
2
3 Without Chandrabindu there is often scope for confusion in meaning
 jaise :– hans : hans, angana : anganaa, swang : swaang aadi main
 Therefore, Chandrabindu must be used to clear such confusion
 kintu jahaan chandrabindu ke prayog se chapai aadi main bahut kathinaayee ho or chandrabindu ke sthaan par bindu kaa prayog kisi prakaar kaa bhram utpann na kare, vahaan chandrabindu ke sthaan par bindu ke prayog kii chhot rahegi
 Like: - No, I, etc
 kavita aadi ke prasang main chand kii drushti se chandrabindu kaa yathasthaan avashya prayog kiya jaae
 Similarly, in the entrances of young children, where the chandrabindu is pronounced, it should be used everywhere in thick letters
 jaise :– kahan, hansnaa, aangan, sanvaarana, main, main, nahin aadi
 2
7
1 If Sanskrit words are used in Visarga, if they are used in the corresponding form, then Visarga must be used
 jaise :– ‘duhkhanubhuti’ main
 If Visarga has been omitted in the form of that word, then without Visarga in that form it will work
 jaise :– ‘dukh-sukh ke saathi’
 2
7
2 It is mandatory to use the used clause at the end of corresponding words
 yatha :– atah, punah, swatah, praayah, purnatah, multah, antat, vastutah, kramshah aadi
 2
7
3 The dissimilar form of 'H' is immersion, so Ghosh 'H' should not be written in its place
 2
7
4 dubsahas / dussahas, nihshabd / nishshabd ke ubhay rup maanya honge
 In these, the preferred form should be given priority
 2
7
4
1 nistej, nirvachan, nishchal aadi shabdon main visarg vaala rup na likhaa jaae
 2
7
4
2 The words conscience, antipura, morning etc
 should be written with visarga
 2
7
5 tadbhav / deshi shabdon main visarg kaa prayog na kiya jaae
 It would be wrong to write six on this basis
 chah likhnaa hi thik hoga
 2
7
6 The words peninsweep, termination, etc
 are also not dissonant in the corresponding form
 2
7
7 visarg ko varna ke saath milakar likhaa jaae, jabaki colon chihn shabd se kuch duuri par ho
 Like: - So, this is how: - 2
8
1 ko hal chihn kaha jaae na ki halant
 The light mark under the consonant indicates that the consonant is void, ie the consonant is purely consonant
 is tarah se 'jagat' halant shabd kaha jayega kyonki yah shabd vyanjanant he, swarant nahin
 2
8
2 According to Rule 2
1
2
2 of making conjunctions, only the markings will be used in the thumbnail
 jaise : chihn, buddha, vidwaan aadi main
 2
8
3 When the use of corresponding words is desirable, only halant forms should be used; Especially when all words or derived words are formed from them
 yatha prak :–, vaak-, sat-, bhagwan-, saakshaat-, jagat-, tejas-, vidyut- aadi
 In the corresponding address, only Rajan, o Lord, will be accepted
 hindi style main he raja, he bhagwaan likhe jaaen
 In words in which the hallmark has been lost, do not attempt to reinstate it
 jaise - mahaan, vidwaan aadi; kyonki hindi main ab 'mahaan' se 'mahanata' or 'vidwaanon' jaise rup prachlit ho chuke hai
 2
8
4 In grammar texts, only those words which are necessary to understand the word structure or are useful in terms of meaning are given to explain consonant conjunctions
 2
8
5 hindi main hrydayngam, uddhran, sanchit aadi shabdon kaa sandhi-viched samajhane kii aavashyaktaa prathit nahin hoti
 Similarly, there is a need to explain the meaning of words like 'interview', 'jagdish', 'hexkosh' only when their treaty is cited
 hindi main inhen swatantra shabdon ke rup main grahan karnaa hi acha hoga
 2
9
1 The spelling of Sanskrit-friendly words should be taken as-is
 at: 'brahma' ko 'bramha', 'chihn' ko 'chinh', 'urin' ko 'urin' main badalanaa uchit nahin hoga
 Similarly, imprudence, sight, exhibition, excess, trespass etc
 are not acceptable inaccurate usage
 inke sthaan par kramash: gruhit, drashtavy, pradarshnee, atyadhik, anadhikaar hi likhnaa chahie
 2
9
2 The corresponding words in which a consonant consonant has disappeared in the event of a combination of three consonants is not allowed to be written
 jaise :– arddh > ardh, tatva > tatv aadi
 2
10
1 Ai, au in Hindi is used to express two types of pronunciation
 pehle prakaar kaa uccharan 'he', 'or' aadi main mul swaron kii tarah hone laga he; jabaki duusare prakaar kaa uccharan 'gavaiya', 'kauwa' aadi shabdon main sandhyaksharon ke rup main aaj bhi surakshit he
 These signs should be used to express both types of utterances
 'gavayya', 'kavva' aadi sanshodhano kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Other examples are: Bhaiya, Syed, Ready, Hawa etc
 2
10
2 dakshin ke ayyar, nayyar, ramayya aadi vyaktinaamon ko hindi uccharan ke anusaar aiyar, naiyar, ramaiya aadi na likhaa jaae, kyonki mulbhasha main iskaa uccharan bhinn he
 2
10
3 Words like avwal, qawwal, qawwali are prevalent
 inhen lekhan main yathavat rakhaa jaae
 2
10
4 In Sanskrit, the word 'bed' should not be written as 'shaya'
 2
11
1 purvakalik kridant pratyay 'kar' kriya se milakar likhaa jaae
 Such as: - By mixing, eating and drinking, crying and etc
 2
11
2 kar + kar se 'karke' or kara + kar se 'karake' banegaa
 2
12
1 In verb forms 'doer', 'coming', 'talker' etc
 should be written separately
 jaise :– main ghar jane vaala hoon, jane vaale log
 2
12
2 'gharwala', 'topiwala', Dilwala, Dudhwala etc
 will be written as one word in the form of additive suffix
 2
12
3 'vaala' jab pratyay ke rup main aayega tab to 2
12
2 ke anusaar milakar likhaa jayega; anyathaa alag se
 This is the directive word in this one, this one, the first one, the good one, the red one, the tomorrow one, etc
 atah ise alag hi likhaa jaae
 Similarly, the words with long hair girl, bearded man etc
 will be written separately
 isse ham rachana ke str par antar kar sakate hai
 Such as: -gaonwala - villager village house - village house 2
13
1 jahaan shrutimulak ya, va kaa prayog vikalp se hota he vahaan na kiya jaae, arthath kiye : kiye, nai : nayi, hua : huwa aadi main se pehle roopon kaa prayog kiya jaae
 This rule should be applied in all forms and situations of the verb, adjective, avayya etc
 jaise :– dikhaae gaye, ram ke liye, pustak liye hue, nai dilli aadi
 2
13
2 Where 'Y' is not the grammatical change but only the basic element of the word, there is no need to make optional dictative emotional change
 jaise :– sthaayee, avyayibhav, daayitv aadi 
 The words of arabic-persian origin from Urdu which have become a part of Hindi and whose foreign sounds have been converted into Hindi sounds can be accepted in Hindi only
 jaise :– kalam, kila, daag aadi 
 But where their pure use in foreign form is desired or it is necessary to state the accent, there should be in-place nukes in their prevalent forms in Hindi
 jaise :– khaanaa : kaanaa, raaj : raaj, fan : fan aadi
 In English words, where the semicircular 'O' sound is used, if the pure form is used in Hindi, the crescent moon should be used over the quantity of 'A'
 jahaan tak angrezi or anya videshi bhashaaon se nae shabd grahan karne or unke devanagari lipyantaran kaa sambandh he, agast-sitambar, 1962 main vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee ayog dwaara vaigyanik shabdaawalee par yojit bhashavidon kii sangoshtee main antarrashtriya shabdaawalee ke devanagari lipyantaran ke sambandh main kii gai sifaarish ullekhneey he
 It states that Devanāgarī transliteration of English words should not be so eloquent that many new signs have to be added to its present Devanāgarī characters
 angrezi shabdon kaa devanagari lipyantaran maanak angrezi uccharan ke adhik-se-adhik nikat hona chahie
 There are some popular words in Hindi that have two forms of spelling being the same
 vidvatsamaj main donon roopon kii ek-si manyata he
 Some examples are: neck / neck, heat / heat, ice / ice, absolutely / absolutely, cold / cold, pedestal / chair, conscription / recruitment, leisure / leisure, tolerance / tolerance, back / back, finally / finally, utensils / Utensils, again / again, shop / shop, sickness / disease etc
 in vaikalpik roopon main se pehle vaale rup ko praathamikta di jaae
 For details see - Appendix 4 2

 vidyut, jal se utpann jal se praapt kii gai vidyutshakti ko jalavidyut kehete hai
 Hydropower is very important in the methods of generating electric power
 vishwa kii sampurna vidyut shakti kaa ek tihaai bhaag jalavidyut ke rup main praapt hota he
 Thus, the available energy in any form can be used for generation of electric power
 jalprapaat main girte hue pani main nihit urja kaa upyog pracheen kaal se hi panchakki ko chalaane main kiya jaataa rahaa he, parantu is urja kaa vidyutshakti ke liye upyog beesvin shatabdi kii hi dein he
 Not only can the energy contained in falling water be used for power generation, but the kinetic energy contained in flowing water can also be used for power generation
 iske liye sabase pehle aise sthaan kaa chunaav karnaa hota he, jahaan band baandhakar prachur maatra main pani jamaa kiya ja sake or usamen nihit shakti ko vidyut shakti ke janan ke liye jal ko aavashyaktaanusaar nalon athwa khuli nahar ke dwaara bijligharon main prayukt kiya ja sake
 Both rain and land have to be studied to find the suitable place
 band aisi jagah banaaya jaataa he jahaan nunatam mulya main bana band adhiktam pani jamaa kar sake
 For this the natural condition of the place should be such that a river passes through a narrow path between the mountains passing through the valley, so that the dam can be converted into a large reservoir by making a dam at the narrowest place
 band ke upar ek or agratal banaaya jaataa he, jahaan se pani khuli nahar athwa nalon dwaara bijlighar tak le jaaya jaataa he
 This water drives large turbines located in the power plant, generating electric power in the planned generators
 tarabine, cement kancreet ke bane drafttub ke mukh par avasthit hota he
 The water rotates the blades of the turbine as it occurs in the guide vane and thus uses its inherent energy to drive the turbine
 chalate hue tarabine kii yantric urja vidyut urja main roopantarit kar di jaati he or is prakaar jal main nihit urja jalavidyut kaa rup le leti he
 In this way after the turbine uses the power contained in the water, the water passes through the draft-tube to the immersion pool, from where it again flows into the river
 draft-tub kii banaavat aisi hoti he ki pani kii shesh urja dhire dhire samaapt ho jaae, jisase baahar aane par nadi ke kinaaron ko kshatigrast na kare
 The energy contained in water depends on its volume and top
 sheersh ke anuroop jalavidyut yojanaon ko teen bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he : 1
 High top plan - more than about 200 meters
 2
 madhyam sheersh yojana - 50 meter se 200 meter tak
 3
 Low top plan - less than 50 meters
 yojana kaa aakaar evam praroop donon hi sheersh ke upar nirbhar karata he or usee ke anusaar uske tarabinon kaa praroop bhi
 Thus Francis turbine and paston cycles are suitable for high head
 madhyam sheersh ke liye shravak pravaahvale daab tarabine prayukt kiye jate hai
 Propellant type turbine is more suitable for lower head
 ucch sheershawali yojanaon main, saadharantaya, pani kaa aaytan adhik nahin hota
 Therefore, water is transported by taps to the runner's vaults from the turbine pool, enabling the energy contained in the water to drive the runner
 tund dwaara pani ke pawah or gati kaa niyantran karne se tathaa baltiyon par chode janevaale pani ke kone kaa vicharan karne se tarabine ke nirgat kaa niyantran kiya ja saktaa he or is tarah janit honevaali vidyutshakti kaa bhi niyantran ho saktaa he
 It is also possible to vary the angle of buckets and both controls can be done automatically
 nodak praroop ke tarabine ke ranor main keval teen yaa chaar pankh hi hote hai
 They are made of heavy steel
 kam sheershawali yojanaon main bahudhaa pani kaa aaytan bahut adhik hota he 
 Therefore, it is not possible to take water in the taps and use an open drain
 bhaar ke anuroop nirgat praapt karne ke liye tarabine main janevaale pani kii maatra kaa vicharan karnaa aavashyak hota he, jo dwaar khulaai dwaara sampadit kiya jaataa he
 These gate guides are like a crescent and their position controls the water
 baari hone ke kaaran ye dwaar dravchaalit daab dwaara pravartit kiye jate hai
 Just as the angle of the guide panes, or buckets, of the Pelton cycle is rotated, they can also be introduced automatically
 swat: chaalit vicharan sarvo motor dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It is a small motor that rotates the hydraulic pressure
 iskaa nivesh tarabine ke nirgat kaa hi ek ansh hota he, at: uske anusaar vicharan karata he
 Thus, the work done by this motor depends on the output of the turbine, which corresponds to the load on it, and automatically controls the guide nettle, or opened by it, by subtracting the hydraulic pressure
 Is, or arranges the angles of buckets
 nodak praroop kii tarabine main caplen praroop kaa tarabine mukhya he
 Its specialty is its strong and high efficiency
 isaki duusari visheshta yah he ki bhaar vicharan se dakshata par bahut kam prabhaav hota he, jiske kaaran vicharanshil bhaar ke liye yah tarabine bahut hi upyukt hota he
 In medium head plans, in general, a mixed turbine is more commonly used, but its selection depends more on the top of the head
 pani ko tarabine main le jane ke liye sthir guide len kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Its output is varied by the variance of its angle
 kam sheershawala tarabine, saadharantaya, khule shashift ke upar sthit hota he
 They are surrounded by a spiral type of casing, allowing water to be carried by a uniform guide guide
 ucch sheershawale tarabine main yah aavaran dhaatu kaa bana hota he
 Turbines can be both horizontal and vertical
 parantu saamanyat:, urdhwadhar hi adhik prayog main aata he
 These have specific types of bearings, which also have to bear the distinguished lateral shock on the machine
 isliye inhen aghat vering kehete hai
 Lubrication of bearings and other moving parts is also a difficult problem in itself
 iske liye daab snehan vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In this, the lubricant oil is pressed and sent to the lubricating places
 tel pump dwaara daab utpann kii jaati he
 There is also a system of automatically shutting down the machine, so that it does not get damaged in such a situation
 snehak tel ko saaf karne ke liye ek tel filter hota he or snehan ke pashchaat garam ho janevaale tel kaa thandha karne ke liye tel sheetak kii bhi vyavastha rahati he
 His position is of paramount importance in hydroelectric schemes
 inaki sthiti, mukhyat:, prakritik evam bhautik kaarnon par nirbhar karti he
 Roughly 10 MW of power would be available if a hydroelectric scheme provided a top of 150 feet with a flow of 1,000 cubic feet per second
 jalashay kaa anumaan bhi is aadhaar par lagaaya ja saktaa he, ki 1
13 varg mile ke kshetrafal main 1 foot pani keval 1 ghan foot prati second kaa pravaah utpann karata he
 Therefore, to get a flow of 1,000 cubic feet per second, the reservoir must have an average of 10 square feet of water over an area of 113 square miles
 kisi bhi jalavidyut yojana ko vyaavhaarik hone ke liye vah aavashyak he ki adhik se adhik sheersh evam pravaah ho
 Low-top schemes can only be practical when the flow of water is sufficient
 ucch sheershawali yojanaayen kam pravaah par bhi vyaavhaarik ho sakati he
 It is not mandatory for the power house to be near the dam
 jalashay pahaad par ho saktaa he or adhik sheersh paane ke liye bijlighar pahaad kii talahati main banaaya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, large tubes of water are transported to the power station
 ucch sheersh vaali yojanaayen saamanyat: isi praroop kii hoti hai
 In many places the water is transported to another power station in the hill by cutting the hill
 bijlighar kaa prithvital par hona bhi anivaary nahin
 Many power stations are also inside the earth and can be accessed only by lift
 mathan main bhi aisa hi bhumigat bijlighar banaaya gaya he
 Such power houses are of the automatic type and operated from the ground floor by remote control
 yadhyapi ye bijlighar mukhyat: prakritik kaarnon se hi prithvi ke andar banaae jate hai, tathaapi ye samrik drushtikon se surakshit hone ke kaaran bahut mahatvapurn hote hai
 There are many low-end schemes in our country
 ganga evam sharada naharon ke upar bahut se bijlighar banaae gaye hai, jinamein keval 20 se 30 foot ke sheersh kaa hi upyog kiya gaya he
 These schemes have become feasible due to high water flow
 jalavidyut yojanaayen, mukhyat:, norge, sweden, switsraland, germany, france, canada, rus evam america main hai
 India is also not far behind in hydroelectric schemes and some of the schemes here are counted among the world's greatest schemes, such as bhakra-nangal, Damodar Valley, Rihand, Hirakund, Nagarjuna Sagar, Koyna, Shivasamudram, Periyar etc
 bahut si jalavidyut yojanaayen bahuddeshiy bhi hoti hai
 These are mainly included with irrigation and flood prevention schemes, so that all-round development of the area can be done
 america main tennesi ghati nigam ke aadhaar par bharat main bhi damodar ghati nigam kii sthapana kii gai
 Many important hydroelectric schemes have been made in the last twenty years and plans are being made after studying the hydroelectric potential everywhere
 jalavidyut yojana main, yadhyapi, aarambh main bahut adhik vyay hota he, tathaapi tab bhi parichaalan vyay kam hone ke kaaran adhikansh yojanaayen aarthik drushtikon se safal hoti hai
 The life of their plant is also relatively much longer
 inkaa mukhya dosha vastav main inaki upabhokta sthanon se duuri he
 These plans cannot be made for wherever they are
 udaahranarth, yadi shakti kii maang kalkatte main he, to vahaan jalavidyut yojana karyanvit karnaa sambhav nahin
 The rivers originating from the Himalayas contain immense water power, but there is no demand for power
 is prakaar jalavidyut yojana dwaara janit vidyut shakti ko bahudhaa bahut duuri tak preshit karnaa hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to incur the expenditure of the remittance system in order to study the hydroelectric scheme relatively
 tab bhi adhikanshat: jalavidyut hi sasti padati he

 Jinnah's differences with the Congress began at the same time when Gandhiji emerged in Indian politics in 1918
 gandhiji ne raajnneeti main ahimsaatmak savinay avagya or hindu mulyon ko badhaava diya
 According to Gandhiji, freedom and self-government can be found by truth, non-violence and civil disobedience, whereas Jinnah's opinion differed from them
 jinna kaa maananaa tha ki sirf sanvaidhanik sangharsh se hi aazaadee pai ja sakati he
 
 Unlike other Congress leaders, Gandhiji did not wear foreign clothes, used Hindi more and more in place of English and Sanatan used Hindu thinking in politics
 yahi kuch kaaran the ki gandhiji ko apaar lokapriyata mili
 Gandhiji supported the Khilafat movement while Jinnah openly opposed it

 jinna ne congress ko gathbandhan ke liye aamantrit kiya
 At first they both decided that they would face the British together, but Jinnah stipulated that the Congress would have to consider a separate constituency for Muslims and the Muslim League as representative of the Muslims of India, which the Congress rejected
 congress main us samay kai muslim netaa the, isliye lig ko bhartiya musalamaanon kaa pratinidhi maananaa uske liye aasaan nahin tha
 Jinnah also held talks with several Congress leaders and the Congress also proposed to merge the League into Congress, but the talks nevertheless failed

 In the modes of transport, where motor vehicles are predominant, there is little use of the top surface as a base, but it is long-lasting, and is prepared at less cost than the local means and labor

 is prakaar kii sanrachana aadhaar ke liye hi upyukt hoti he, kintu yadi yatayaat kii tivrata kam ho, to upree tah ke liye bhi prayojya he
 The biggest requirement of the road is to be strong and compact of the lower surface
 at: pehle nichali sataha ko icchit sataha par laakar roller dwaara thas bana liya jaataa he
 In the lower surface, when there is micronutrient soil, such as silt soil, a layer of covering is placed on it before placing a rough aggregate, ie stone aggregate, called the middle surface
 nichali sataha visanvahak tah kaa kaam karti he
 This prevents the micronutrient soil from coming into the rough set while driving the roller

 The cost of constructing a dilapidated road is less, as it uses only local materials, less labor and heavy machines are not used
 manchanirmaan ke liye to yah bahut hi upyukt he
 The floor can be strengthened no matter when
 in gunon ne hi jalabaddh makadam sadak ko mahatvapurn bana rakhaa he
 After the era of motor trains, the lack of roads started appearing
 dhul ek samasya ban gayi
 Under the wheels of high-speed vehicles, a low air pressure area is generated which pulls dust out of action and the road gradually becomes 'hollow'
 saath hi gadiyon ke saath 'dhul ke badal' ban jate hai
 To solve this problem, wires are sprinkled over the road

 taral daab -kisi bartan me rakhe taral dwaara bartan kii diwaar ke prati ekant chhetrafal par aropit bal ko taral daab kehete he | Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs are a group of drugs
 yah samooh kii aushadhi peeda ghataane mai, tapakram ghataane mai or inflamesan ko niyantran karne ke liye prayog hote he
 These group of drugs are often non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors
 yah cycloxijnej naamak injimako roak dete he 
 Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the production of prostaglandin and thromboxane, which are the messenger molecule of inflamation
 iske inhibisan se at:, inflamesan niyantrit hota he
 Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs are of this type- gurutvkarshan ek padaarth dwaara ek duusare kii ore aakrisht hone kii pravriti he
 The first attempt to give a mathematical formula about gravity was made by Isaac Newton, which was surprisingly correct
 unhone gurutvkarshan siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Newton's theory was later replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
 isse purv varah mihir ne kaha tha ki kisi prakaar kii shakti hi vastuon ko pruthivi par chipkaae rakhti he
 Modern work on the theory of gravity began in the late 16th and early 17th century with the work of Galileo Galilei
 apane mashhoor prayogon main pisa ke tower se gendon ko chhodane kaa prayog kiya gaya, or baad main gendon ke saavdhaneepurvak maap ke saath incleain ko ghumaya gaya, galileo ne dikhaaya ki gurutvkarshan twaran sabhi vastuon ke liye samaan he
 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa sambandh hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutv niyatank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 german khagolvid kepler ne grahon kii gati kaa adhyayan karke teen niyam diye
 Kepler's first law: - All planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and the Sun is at the focus of those orbits
 dwitiya niyam - kisi bhi grah ko surya se milaane vaali rekha samaan samay me samaan kshetrafal paar karti he
 That is, the regional speed of each planet remains fixed
 arthath jab grah surya se dur hota he to uski chaal kam ho jaati he
 Third law: - The square of the Sun's rotation period of each planet is proportional to the third power of the semi-long axis of its long circular orbit
 gurutvkarshan: "pitaaji, yah prithvi, jis par ham nivas karte hai, kis par tiki hui he?" leelavati ne shatabdiyon purv yah prashn apane pita bhaskaracharya se poocha tha
 In response, Bhaskaracharya said, "bale Leelavati !, some people who say that this earth is based on Sheshnag, Tortoise or Elephant or any other thing, then they are wrong
 yadi yah maan bhi liya jaae ki yah kisi vastu par tiki hui he to bhi prashn bana rahata he ki vah vastu kis par tiki hui he or is prakaar kaaran kaa kaaran or phir uskaa kaaran


 yah kram chalata rahaa, to nyaay shaastra main ise anavastha dosha kehete hai
 Lilavati said, yet the question remains, what is the earth resting on? tab bhaskaracharya ne kaha, kyon ham yah nahin maan sakate ki prithvi kisi bhi vastu par aadhaarit nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 If we say that the earth rests on its own force and call it gravitational force, then what is the fault? is par leelavati ne poocha yah kaise sambhav he
 Then Bhaskaracharya says about the theory that the power of things is very strange
 aage kehete hai- That is, there is attraction power in the earth
 prithvi apni aakarshan shakti se baari padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he or aakarshan ke kaaran vah jameen par girte hai
 But when the same strength came from all around in the sky, how did anyone fall? That is, the planets in the sky remain motionless because the gravitational powers of various planets keep balance
