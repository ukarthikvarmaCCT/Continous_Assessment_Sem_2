 15 agast ke aas-paas dilli apni suraksha ko lekar satark ho hi jaati he, iske baad bhi sansad ke bilkul kareeb constitution club ke baahar umr kalid par goli chalaane kii koshish hoti he
 In terms of security, how did anyone dare to bring a pistol in this high alert zone and escaped
 umr kalid constitution club ke baahar chaay kii dukaan se pepsy pikar laut rahe the ki peeche se hamalaa hota he
 He was punched and dropped, but Omar held his hand with a pistol in his hand
 dhai baje se vahaan 'khoff se azaadi' naam kaa kaarykram hone vaala tha, usee ke liye umr kalid samay se pehle pahunch kar chaay pi rahe the
 Then there came a person who was in white shirt and started to push Omar Khalid
 sab kuch bees-pachchis second main hua
 Omar attacked Omar from behind
 umr ke saathiyon ne hamalavar ko pakadaney kaa prayaas kiya ve uske peeche daude
 But he managed to escape
 kya hamalavar achaanak aa gaya yaa wo vahaan se guzar rahaa hoga yun hi paan khaane ke liye, haath main pistaul lekar or umr dikh gaya hoga to sochaa hoga chalo goli soli chalaate hai
 Isn't it frightening to think that someone threatens from behind to shoot a student, kills him and then runs away with a pistol
 yahi wo chaay kii dukaan he jahaan umr ne pepsy pi thi
 He was accompanied by a few companions who remained behind and Omar went ahead so that he could participate in the event at the Constitution Club
 is jagah se aap saamaanya dinon main bhi chaaron taraf se nazar ghumaayenge to mustaid avasthaa main police dikhegi
 On August 15, the security here is more chalk
 goli chalaane vaala kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa magar apane makasad ke bilkul kareeb pahunch gaya tha
 At 240 in the afternoon, our colleague Rajiv Ranjan sends news in the news room that there has been an attempt to shoot Omar Khalid but he is safe
 uske baad aati he zamin par giri pistal kii ye tasviir
 Rajiv also spoke to Khalid Saifi, who went to tea with Omar
 umr surakshit he
 Is there still a lot of need to focus on who are the people who are walking around in Delhi with pistols and who are looking for them
 kya yah sab achaanak ho jaataa he yaa phir kahin kuch he jahaan badi taiyaari ke baad faisla liya jaataa hoga
 After the assassination of Gauri Lankesh, which are coming out in the investigation, can this attack on Omar Khalid be taken lightly even after this
 'khuf se azaadi' kaarykram main rohit vemula kii maa radhika vemula, jeenyu ke laapata chaatr najeeb kii maa fatima nafis, junayd kii maa fatima, junayd jisaki, faridabad ke paas chalati train main peet kar hatya kar di gai thi
 Former IPS officer SR Darapuri, state MP Manoj Jha, Prashant Bhushan, Arfa Khanam Sherwani, Amit Sengupta, former MP Ali Anwar were the speakers
 jharkhand main bheed ne jis alimuddin kii hatya kar di thi, uski patni bhi bolne vaali thi
 Dr Kafeel Khan of BR Medical College, Gorakhpur was also a speaker
 ankit saxena ke pita yashpal saxena bhi bolne vaale the
 The days brought by these two are propagated through whatsapp University as if the world is threatened by them
 or jo sabase surakshit kshetra hai vahaan inke peeche pistaul lekar pahunchane vaale ko koi khatara nahin he
 Recently there was news that JNU is not taking phd of Omar Khalid and Kanhaiya
 court ke aadesh ke baad inaki piechdi jamaa hui he
 Omar Khalid has a ph
d in the Singhbhum district of Jharkhand, between 1800 and 2000, on how the rights of the people there have been attacked under the pretext of different regimes and laws
 kanhaiya ne bhi kaha he ki is ghatana main koun log shaamil hai yah pataa lagane kaa kaam dilli police kaa he, lekin yah pataa lagane kii zarurat nahin he ki umr yaa kanhaiya kii baton se kin logon ko dikkat ho rahi he
 Omar Khalid also demanded police protection in March 2016
 nahin mili
 Two months ago, when Omar Khalid was threatened again, he lodged a complaint at Vasant Kunj North police station in Delhi and demanded police protection but could not be found
 ham aapako bataa den ki 10 farvari 2016 ko jeenyu maamle main agyaat logon ke khilaaf maamla darj hua tha
 February 2016 to August 2018 arrived but the charge sheet has not been filed
 na aarope kaa pataa he na saboot kaa
 It also has responsible media
 in donon ko is tarah se pesh kiya jaataa he jaise bharat kii sari samasyaon kii jad yahi hai
 Delhi Police did not take time to reach
 police ne use turant apni castady main le liya
 The attacker is not yet caught
 yah ilaaka sisitivi camere se chaak chauband hoga hi
 Hope the police gets a clue from there
 krime branch ne das timen banaai hai
 Cartridges are also being searched by chance
 usee jagah par dilli bijepi kaaryakartaaon kii baithak ho rahi thi
 BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi also visited the spot
 lekhi kahati hai ki umr khalid zindaabad ke naare lag rahe the, khuf se azaadi kaarykram main vaktaa ke rup main aae es aar darapuri kah rahe hai ki vahaan umr khalid zindaabad kaa koi naaraa nahin laga
 On the other hand, this morning when Naveen Bhati's message came that an attempt was being made to spread communal tension in Dadri
 yah jagah jiti road par he or ghaziabad se bulandshahr ke bich
 Seeing Bhati's message, how could this happen? bachche ko bhi peeche se goli markar koun bhaag rahaa he
 Who must be shooting from behind on the elderly
 hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger jab padtaal karne pahunche to paaya ki ghatana sahi he
 Mukesh has been doing journalism of crime for a long time
 unke liye bhi dadri ke in ghayal logon se milakar ajeeb laga
 Mukesh says that even if someone is eccentric, he will shoot once, but who is he or is he from any organization that is going to shoot people of a community
 mukesh singh senger dadri ke mewatian mohalla or nai aabaadi main rahane vaale in paanch logon ke ghar gaye jinhen goli maari gai he wo bhi peeche se
 We want to tell you the story of all these five people
 cese number ek
 Fayyaz Ahmad, who works in tailoring, was returning to his home at 10:30 in the night
 57 saal ke faiyaaz kii jeb main 30,000 rupee the tabhi dadri main road par bike par do savaar aate hai
 Both have their faces covered and are shot away
 koi baat nahin hoti he, paise kii lut nahin hoti he
 This was the first incident
 kisi ko bhi laga hoga ki saamaanya aparaadh kii ghatana he
 But till August 9, similarly five people are shot from behind, including a child
 12 july ko saatvin class main padhane vaala 14 saal kaa mohammad faizan pitaaji ke meet kii dukaan se ghar laut rahaa tha
 The time was 9:30 AM
 bike par savaar do ladke aate hai, jinka munh khulaa hua tha
 They shoot Faizan in the waist without talking
 thik usee tarah se jis tarah se faiyaaz ahamed ko goli maari gai thi
 This incident is also from Dadri Main Road
 to aapane dekha ki 10 july or 12 july ko faiyaaz or faizan ko ek hi tarah se peeche se goli maari jaati he
 No quarrel, no enmity
 teesri ghatana 14 july kii he
 26-year-old Irfan was leaving his clothes shop that bike riders come and shoot from behind
 raat ke saadhe nau baje the
 Irfan survived due to darkness, he was not shot
 gharavaalon ne dar kar maare police main shikaayat tak darj nahin karai
 Now comes case number four
 ham aapako phir se bataa den ki dadri ilaake main ek khaas samudaay ke chah logon ko peeche se goli maari gai he
 Five of these six are injured and one has survived
 mukesh singh senger ne har kisi ke ghar jaakar maamle kii padtaal kii he
 Case number four is a case of a thirty-year-old buff
 shaukeen beldaari karata he
 Bildari means hoe
 mitti nikaalata he
 Belongs to a very poor family
 shaukeen apana mobile charge karakar laut rahaa tha
 The incident took place on July 22 and it was only nine and a half
 iske anusaar tezi se ek bike aati he
 Three people were riding on it
 unhone peeche se qamar main goli maari
 Before that, Sambhalata, the attacker fled
 shaukeen kii haalat gambhir thi isliye use dadri se safadarajang aspataal laayaa gaya
 From there, he was sent back after two to three days of treatment
 mukesh singh senger ke anusaar shaukeel bahut bolne kii haalat main nahin tha
 Mother and four brothers work as laborers
 iskaa ilaaj nahin ho paa rahaa he kyonki paise nahi hai
 Mukesh felt that the fondness was not good
 ise turant behatar chikitsa kii zarurat he kyonki sankraman yani infections tezi se failata ja rahaa he
 Shaukeen is not married
 ise kanoon kii itani bhi jaankaree nahin he ki ghar se koi exiaar kii copy lene nahin gaya he
 While a case has been registered in this case
 to aapane abhi tak dekha ki 10 july, 12 july, 14 july or 22 july kii ghatana kaa hisaab
 How people of the same community are shot from the waist or waist from behind
 ab mukesh singh senger pahunchate hai cese number paanch par
 Salman, 24, and Afsar, 30, are both drivers of brick kiln trucks
 9 agast kii raat 10 bajkar 20 minute par apane ghar se donon hi saath nikle the
 Were walking on the street near the house
 tabhi do ladke bike se aae, is baar inkaa cheharaa dhanka nahin tha magar andhera hone ke kaaran cheharaa nahin dikhaa
 No conversation with Salman and Afsar, but not shot just shot from behind
 jisamen 24 saal ke salmaan ke qamar ke peeche goli lagati he or afasaar ke pair main goli lagati he
 Both are being treated in Dadri itself
 mukesh kii mulaakaat salmaan se hui magar afasaar se nahin kyonki vah us vakt aspataal gaya tha
 Talked with Afsar's mother
 tippaniyan People from the same section of the poorer section are shot from behind within a month
 sabhi ko ek hi jagah ke aasapaas goli lagati he
 There is also a time to shoot
 sirf andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he ki in garib logon ko goli maarane vaale kaa makasad kya rahaa hoga
 If its intention is to create communal tension or it really is, then the government should take action immediately
 vaise ek maheene main ek bhi giraftaar nahin hui he
 Mukesh Singh Sengar spoke to SP Greater Noida Ashish Srivastava
 unhone bhi mana kii aisi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai
 The attack took place on six people
 chaar cese darj hue hai kyonki ek main do logon par hua tha or ek ne cese hi darj nahin karaayaa
 We wanted Mukesh Singh Sengar to comment on the matter
 to aapane suna 10 july se yah ghatana ho rahi he
 Naveen Bhati is a lawyer and also a Samajwadi Party leader
 sthaneey nivasee yaqub mallik ne shaq jataayaa he ki koi bhaichaare main aag daalana chahta he
 This incident of being shot in the same way raises many questions
 kya koi koshish kar rahaa he ki kisi ko uksaaya jaae, taaki usase bahes ho, tanaav ho or maahaul kharaab ho
 It is beyond our comprehension that there is neither enmity nor robbery, just someone comes and shoots someone and runs away
 wo bhi ek samudaay ke logon ko
 Faizan, Fayyaz, Irrfan, Shaukeen, Salman and Afsar have been shot for what
 sab kuch bees-pachchis second main hua
 Omar attacked Omar from behind
 umr ke saathiyon ne hamalavar ko pakadaney kaa prayaas kiya ve uske peeche daude
 But he managed to escape
 kya hamalavar achaanak aa gaya yaa wo vahaan se guzar rahaa hoga yun hi paan khaane ke liye, haath main pistaul lekar or umr dikh gaya hoga to sochaa hoga chalo goli soli chalaate hai
 Isn't it frightening to think that someone threatens from behind to shoot a student, kills him and then runs away with a pistol
 yahi wo chaay kii dukaan he jahaan umr ne pepsy pi thi
 He was accompanied by a few companions who remained behind and Omar went ahead so that he could participate in the event at the Constitution Club

 On August 15, the security here is more chalk
 goli chalaane vaala kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa magar apane makasad ke bilkul kareeb pahunch gaya tha
 At 240 in the afternoon, our colleague Rajiv Ranjan sends news in the news room that there has been an attempt to shoot Omar Khalid but he is safe
 uske baad aati he zamin par giri pistal kii ye tasviir
 Rajiv also spoke to Khalid Saifi, who went to tea with Omar
 umr surakshit he
 Is there still a lot of need to focus on who are the people who are walking around in Delhi with pistols and who are looking for them
 kya yah sab achaanak ho jaataa he yaa phir kahin kuch he jahaan badi taiyaari ke baad faisla liya jaataa hoga
 After the assassination of Gauri Lankesh, which are coming out in the investigation, can this attack on Omar Khalid be taken lightly even after this

 Omar Khalid has a ph
d in the Singhbhum district of Jharkhand, between 1800 and 2000, on how the rights of the people there have been attacked under the pretext of different regimes and laws
 kanhaiya ne bhi kaha he ki is ghatana main koun log shaamil hai yah pataa lagane kaa kaam dilli police kaa he, lekin yah pataa lagane kii zarurat nahin he ki umr yaa kanhaiya kii baton se kin logon ko dikkat ho rahi he
 Omar Khalid also demanded police protection in March 2016

 Two months ago, when Omar Khalid was threatened again, he lodged a complaint at Vasant Kunj North police station in Delhi and demanded police protection but could not be found
 ham aapako bataa den ki 10 farvari 2016 ko jeenyu maamle main agyaat logon ke khilaaf maamla darj hua tha
 February 2016 to August 2018 arrived but the charge sheet has not been filed
 na aarope kaa pataa he na saboot kaa
 It also has responsible media
 in donon ko is tarah se pesh kiya jaataa he jaise bharat kii sari samasyaon kii jad yahi hai
 Delhi Police did not take time to reach

 The attacker is not yet caught

 On the other hand, this morning when Naveen Bhati's message came that an attempt was being made to spread communal tension in Dadri
 yah jagah jiti road par he or ghaziabad se bulandshahr ke bich
 Seeing Bhati's message, how could this happen? bachche ko bhi peeche se goli markar koun bhaag rahaa he
 Who must be shooting from behind on the elderly
 hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger jab padtaal karne pahunche to paaya ki ghatana sahi he
 Mukesh has been doing journalism of crime for a long time
 unke liye bhi dadri ke in ghayal logon se milakar ajeeb laga
 Mukesh says that even if someone is eccentric, he will shoot once, but who is he or is he from any organization that is going to shoot people of a community
 mukesh singh senger dadri ke mewatian mohalla or nai aabaadi main rahane vaale in paanch logon ke ghar gaye jinhen goli maari gai he wo bhi peeche se
 We want to tell you the story of all these five people
 cese number ek
 Fayyaz Ahmad, who works in tailoring, was returning to his home at 10:30 in the night
 57 saal ke faiyaaz kii jeb main 30,000 rupee the tabhi dadri main road par bike par do savaar aate hai
 Both have their faces covered and are shot away
 koi baat nahin hoti he, paise kii lut nahin hoti he
 This was the first incident
 kisi ko bhi laga hoga ki saamaanya aparaadh kii ghatana he
 But till August 9, similarly five people are shot from behind, including a child
 12 july ko saatvin class main padhane vaala 14 saal kaa mohammad faizan pitaaji ke meet kii dukaan se ghar laut rahaa tha
 The time was 9:30 AM
 bike par savaar do ladke aate hai, jinka munh khulaa hua tha
 They shoot Faizan in the waist without talking
 thik usee tarah se jis tarah se faiyaaz ahamed ko goli maari gai thi
 This incident is also from Dadri Main Road
 to aapane dekha ki 10 july or 12 july ko faiyaaz or faizan ko ek hi tarah se peeche se goli maari jaati he
 No quarrel, no enmity
 teesri ghatana 14 july kii he
 26-year-old Irfan was leaving his clothes shop that bike riders come and shoot from behind
 raat ke saadhe nau baje the
 Irfan survived due to darkness, he was not shot
 gharavaalon ne dar kar maare police main shikaayat tak darj nahin karai
 Now comes case number four
 ham aapako phir se bataa den ki dadri ilaake main ek khaas samudaay ke chah logon ko peeche se goli maari gai he
 Five of these six are injured and one has survived
 mukesh singh senger ne har kisi ke ghar jaakar maamle kii padtaal kii he
 Case number four is a case of a thirty-year-old buff
 shaukeen beldaari karata he
 Bildari means hoe
 mitti nikaalata he
 Belongs to a very poor family
 shaukeen apana mobile charge karakar laut rahaa tha
 The incident took place on July 22 and it was only nine and a half
 iske anusaar tezi se ek bike aati he
 Three people were riding on it
 unhone peeche se qamar main goli maari
 Before that, Sambhalata, the attacker fled
 shaukeen kii haalat gambhir thi isliye use dadri se safadarajang aspataal laayaa gaya
 From there, he was sent back after two to three days of treatment
 mukesh singh senger ke anusaar shaukeel bahut bolne kii haalat main nahin tha
 Mother and four brothers work as laborers
 iskaa ilaaj nahin ho paa rahaa he kyonki paise nahi hai
 Mukesh felt that the fondness was not good
 ise turant behatar chikitsa kii zarurat he kyonki sankraman yani infections tezi se failata ja rahaa he
 Shaukeen is not married
 ise kanoon kii itani bhi jaankaree nahin he ki ghar se koi exiaar kii copy lene nahin gaya he
 While a case has been registered in this case
 to aapane abhi tak dekha ki 10 july, 12 july, 14 july or 22 july kii ghatana kaa hisaab
 How people of the same community are shot from the waist or waist from behind
 ab mukesh singh senger pahunchate hai cese number paanch par
 Salman, 24, and Afsar, 30, are both drivers of brick kiln trucks
 9 agast kii raat 10 bajkar 20 minute par apane ghar se donon hi saath nikle the
 Were walking on the street near the house
 tabhi do ladke bike se aae, is baar inkaa cheharaa dhanka nahin tha magar andhera hone ke kaaran cheharaa nahin dikhaa
 No conversation with Salman and Afsar, but not shot just shot from behind
 jisamen 24 saal ke salmaan ke qamar ke peeche goli lagati he or afasaar ke pair main goli lagati he
 Both are being treated in Dadri itself
 mukesh kii mulaakaat salmaan se hui magar afasaar se nahin kyonki vah us vakt aspataal gaya tha
 Talked with Afsar's mother
 tippaniyan People from the same section of the poorer section are shot from behind within a month
 sabhi ko ek hi jagah ke aasapaas goli lagati he
 There is also a time to shoot
 sirf andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he ki in garib logon ko goli maarane vaale kaa makasad kya rahaa hoga
 If its intention is to create communal tension or it really is, then the government should take action immediately
 vaise ek maheene main ek bhi giraftaar nahin hui he
 Mukesh Singh Sengar spoke to SP Greater Noida Ashish Srivastava
 unhone bhi mana kii aisi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai
 The attack took place on six people
 chaar cese darj hue hai kyonki ek main do logon par hua tha or ek ne cese hi darj nahin karaayaa
 We wanted Mukesh Singh Sengar to comment on the matter
 to aapane suna 10 july se yah ghatana ho rahi he
 Naveen Bhati is a lawyer and also a Samajwadi Party leader
 sthaneey nivasee yaqub mallik ne shaq jataayaa he ki koi bhaichaare main aag daalana chahta he
 This incident of being shot in the same way raises many questions
 kya koi koshish kar rahaa he ki kisi ko uksaaya jaae, taaki usase bahes ho, tanaav ho or maahaul kharaab ho
 It is beyond our comprehension that there is neither enmity nor robbery, just someone comes and shoots someone and runs away
 wo bhi ek samudaay ke logon ko
 Faizan, Fayyaz, Irrfan, Shaukeen, Salman and Afsar have been shot for what
 yahi wo chaay kii dukaan he jahaan umr ne pepsy pi thi

 vaise ek maheene main ek bhi giraftaar nahin hui he
 Mukesh Singh Sengar spoke to SP Greater Noida Ashish Srivastava
 unhone bhi mana kii aisi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai
 The attack took place on six people
 chaar cese darj hue hai kyonki ek main do logon par hua tha or ek ne cese hi darj nahin karaayaa
 We wanted Mukesh Singh Sengar to comment on the matter
 to aapane suna 10 july se yah ghatana ho rahi he
 Naveen Bhati is a lawyer and also a Samajwadi Party leader
 sthaneey nivasee yaqub mallik ne shaq jataayaa he ki koi bhaichaare main aag daalana chahta he
 This incident of being shot in the same way raises many questions
 kya koi koshish kar rahaa he ki kisi ko uksaaya jaae, taaki usase bahes ho, tanaav ho or maahaul kharaab ho
 It is beyond our comprehension that there is neither enmity nor robbery, just someone comes and shoots someone and runs away
 wo bhi ek samudaay ke logon ko
 Faizan, Fayyaz, Irrfan, Shaukeen, Salman and Afsar have been shot for what
 in donon ko lekar aae din whatsap uniwarsity ke zarie propaganda kiya jaataa he jaise ki duniya ko inhen se khatara he
 And those who are in the safest areas, there is no danger to those who carry pistols behind them
 abhi haal hi main khabar ai thi ki jeenyu umr kalid or kanhaiya kii piechdi nahin le rahaa he
 His phd has been submitted after the court order
 jharkhand ke singhbhum zile main 1800 se lekar 2000 ke bich alag-alag shasno or kanoon ke bahaane vahaan ke logon ke hakon par kis tarah se hamalaa hua he, us par umr kalid kii piechdi he
 Kanhaiya has also said that the work of the Delhi Police is to find out who are involved in this incident, but there is no need to find out who is getting hurt by the talk of Umar or Kanhaiya
 umr khalid ne march 2016 main bhi police suraksha kii maang kii thi
 Not found do maheene pehle umr khalid ko phir dhamkee ai to usne dilli ke vasant kunj north thane main shikaayat darj karai or police suraksha kii maang kii magar nahin mili
 Let us tell you that on 10 February 2016, a case was registered against unknown people in JNU case
 farvari 2016 se agast 2018 aa gaya magar chargeshit tak file nahin hui he
 Neither the allegation is known nor the proof
 isamen zimmedaar media bhi he
 These two are presented in such a way that they are the root of all the problems of India
 dilli police ko pahunchane main vakt to nahin laga
 The police immediately took him in his custody
 hamalaa karne vaala abhi tak giraft main nahin aayaa he
 This area will be fully enclosed with CCTV cameras
 ummid he police ko vahaan se koi suraag mili
 The Crime Branch has formed ten teams
 maukey se kaartoos kii bhi talash ho rahi he
 Delhi BJP workers were meeting at the same place
 bijepi saansad minakshi lekhi bhi ghatnasthal gayi
 Lekhi says that Omar Khalid was raising slogans of Zindabad, SR Darapuri, who came as a speaker in the freedom program, is saying that there was no slogan of Omar Khalid Zindabad
 udhar, aaj subah jab naveen bhaati kaa massej aayaa ki dadri main sampradayik tanaav failaane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 This place is on GT Road and between Ghaziabad to Bulandshahr
 bhaati kaa massej dekhakar laga ki aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 Who is running after shooting the child from behind also
 buzurg par koun peeche se goli chalaa rahaa hoga
 When our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar arrived to investigate, we found that the incident was true
 mukesh lambey se aparaadh kii patrakarita karte rahe hai
 It was strange for him to meet these injured people of Dadri
 mukesh kaa kahana he ki koi sanakee bhi hoga to ek baar goli chalaaegaa, lekin wo koun he kya wo kisi sanghathan kaa he jo ek samudaay ke logon ko goli maar kar chalaa ja rahaa he
 Mukesh Singh Sengar went to the Mewatian Mohalla of Dadri and the houses of these five people living in the new population who have been shot dead too
 ham aapako in sabhi paanch logon kii daastaan bataanaa chaahate hai
 Case number one
 silaai kaa kaam karne vaale faiyaaz ahamed kaam khatm kar raat ke saadhe das baje apane ghar laut rahe the
 57-year-old Fayaz had Rs 30,000 in his pocket when Dadri Main Road comes with two riders on the bike
 donon kaa cheharaa dhanka hota he or goli maar kar chale jate hai
 There is nothing, there is no loot of money
 ye pehali ghatana thi
 One must have felt that there is a general crime incident
 magar 9 agast tak isi tarah paanch logon ko peeche se goli maari jaati he, jisamen ek baccha bhi he
 On July 12, Mohammad Faizan, a 14-year-old studying in seventh grade, was returning home from Dad's meat shop
 vakt ho rahaa tha 9 baj kar 40 minute
 Two boys on the bike come, whose mouth was open
 bina baat ke faizan ko qamar main goli maarthe hai
 Exactly the way Fayyaz Ahmed was shot
 yah ghatana bhi dadri main road kii he
 So you saw that on July 10 and July 12, Faiz and Faizan are shot in the same way from behind
 koi jhagada nahin, koi dushmani nahin
 The third incident is on 14 July
 26 saal kaa irafaan apni kapade kii dukaan se nikal hi rahaa tha ki bike savaar aate hai or peeche se goli chalaate hai
 It was half past nine in the night
 andhere ke kaaran irfan batch gaya, use goli nahin lagi
 The family members did not even file a police complaint
 ab aate hai cese number chaar
 Let us tell you again that in Dadri area six people from a particular community have been shot from behind
 in chah main paanch ghayal hai or ek batch gaya he
 Mukesh Singh Sengar has investigated the case by visiting everyone's home
 cese number chaar kaa maamla he tees saal ke shaukeen kaa
 The fondant bails
 beldaari matlab kudaal chalaata he
 Extracts soil
 behad garib parivaar kaa he
 Shaukeen was returning after charging her mobile
 ghatana 22 july kii he or vakt vahi tha saadhe nau baj rahe the
 Accordingly, a bike comes fast
 jis par teen log savaar the
 He shot in the waist from behind
 isse pehle vah sanbhalta, hamalavar bhaag gaye
 Shaukeen's condition was critical, so he was brought to Safdarjung Hospital from Dadri
 vahaan se do teen din ke ilaaj ke baad waapas bhej diya gaya
 According to Mukesh Singh Sengar, Shaukeel was not in a very speaking position
 maa or chaar bhai mazaduri karte hai
 It is not being treated because there is no money
 mukesh ko laga ki shaukeen kii haalat acchhee nahi he
 It needs immediate medical attention because the infection is spreading rapidly
 shaukeen kii shaadi nahin hui he
 It does not even know much about the law that no one has gone to get a copy of the FIR from home
 jabaki is maamle main cese darj ho chukaa he
 So you have seen that the accounts of July 10, July 12, July 14 and July 22 have been recorded
 kaise ek hi samudaay ke logon ko qamar yaa qamar se neeche peeche se goli maari jaati he
 Now Mukesh Singh Sanger reaches case number five
 24 saal kaa salmaan or 30 saal kaa afasaar, ye donon eent ke bhatte main chalane vaale trakon ke driver hai
 On the night of 9 August, at 10:20, both of them left their homes
 ghar ke paas hi gali main paidal ja rahe the
 Then two boys came by bike, this time their face was not covered but due to the darkness, the face did not show
 salmaan or afasaar se koi baatcheet nahin, kahasuni nahin bas peeche se goli maar di
 In which 24-year-old Salman is shot behind the waist and Afsar is shot in the leg
 donon kaa ilaaj dadri main hi chal rahaa he
 Mukesh met Salman but not Afsar as he had gone to the hospital at that time
 afasaar kii maa se baat hui
 The comments garib tabake ke ek hi samudaay ke logon ko ek maheene ke bheetar peeche se goli maari jaati he
 Everyone is shot around the same place
 goli chalaane kaa vakt bhi ek sa he
 It can only be guessed that the motive of those who shot these poor people must have been
 agar uskaa iraadaa vaaki sapradayik tanaav paidaa karne kaa rahaa hoga yaa he to sarkaar ko turant ection lenaa chahie
 However, not a single arrest has been made in a month
 mukesh singh senger ne espi greater noida ashish shrivastav se baat kii
 They also believed that such incidents are happening
 hamalaa chah logon par hua tha
 Four cases have been filed because one happened on two people and one did not register a case
 ham chaahate the ki mukesh singh senger is maamle par apni tippanee den
 So you heard this incident has been happening since July 10
 naveen bhaati vakil hai or samaajawaadee party ke netaa bhi hai
 Local resident Yakub Mallick has expressed suspicion that someone wants to set fire to the brotherhood
 ek hi tarah se goli maare jane kii yah ghatana kai tarah ke sawaal paidaa karti he
 Is anyone trying to provoke someone, so that it is debated, tense and the atmosphere is spoiled
 hamaari bhi samaj se baahar he ki na to dushmani he, na lut paat he bas koi aata he or kisi ko goli markar bhaag jaataa he
 That too to the people of a community
 faizan, faiyaaz, irafaan, shaukeen, salmaan or afasaar ko kis baat ke liye goli maari gai he
 Omar Khalid also demanded police protection in March 2016
 nahin mili
 Two months ago, when Omar Khalid was threatened again, he lodged a complaint at Vasant Kunj North police station in Delhi and demanded police protection but could not be found
 ham aapako bataa den ki 10 farvari 2016 ko jeenyu maamle main agyaat logon ke khilaaf maamla darj hua tha
 February 2016 to August 2018 arrived but the charge sheet has not been filed
 na aarope kaa pataa he na saboot kaa
 It also has responsible media
 in donon ko is tarah se pesh kiya jaataa he jaise bharat kii sari samasyaon kii jad yahi hai
 Delhi Police did not take time to reach
 police ne use turant apni castady main le liya
 The attacker is not yet caught
 yah ilaaka sisitivi camere se chaak chauband hoga hi
 Hope the police gets a clue from there
 krime branch ne das timen banaai hai
 Cartridges are also being searched by chance
 usee jagah par dilli bijepi kaaryakartaaon kii baithak ho rahi thi
 BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi also visited the spot
 lekhi kahati hai ki umr khalid zindaabad ke naare lag rahe the, khuf se azaadi kaarykram main vaktaa ke rup main aae es aar darapuri kah rahe hai ki vahaan umr khalid zindaabad kaa koi naaraa nahin laga
 On the other hand, this morning when Naveen Bhati's message came that an attempt was being made to spread communal tension in Dadri
 yah jagah jiti road par he or ghaziabad se bulandshahr ke bich
 Seeing Bhati's message, how could this happen? bachche ko bhi peeche se goli markar koun bhaag rahaa he
 Who must be shooting from behind on the elderly
 hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger jab padtaal karne pahunche to paaya ki ghatana sahi he
 Mukesh has been doing journalism of crime for a long time
 unke liye bhi dadri ke in ghayal logon se milakar ajeeb laga
 Mukesh says that even if someone is eccentric, he will shoot once, but who is he or is he from any organization that is going to shoot people of a community
 mukesh singh senger dadri ke mewatian mohalla or nai aabaadi main rahane vaale in paanch logon ke ghar gaye jinhen goli maari gai he wo bhi peeche se
 We want to tell you the story of all these five people

 The incident took place on July 22 and it was only nine and a half
 iske anusaar tezi se ek bike aati he
 Three people were riding on it
 unhone peeche se qamar main goli maari
 Before that, Sambhalata, the attacker fled
 shaukeen kii haalat gambhir thi isliye use dadri se safadarajang aspataal laayaa gaya
 From there, he was sent back after two to three days of treatment
 mukesh singh senger ke anusaar shaukeel bahut bolne kii haalat main nahin tha
 Mother and four brothers work as laborers
 iskaa ilaaj nahin ho paa rahaa he kyonki paise nahi hai
 Mukesh felt that the fondness was not good

 Shaukeen is not married
 ise kanoon kii itani bhi jaankaree nahin he ki ghar se koi exiaar kii copy lene nahin gaya he
 While a case has been registered in this case

 Both are being treated in Dadri itself
 mukesh kii mulaakaat salmaan se hui magar afasaar se nahin kyonki vah us vakt aspataal gaya tha
 Talked with Afsar's mother
 tippaniyan People from the same section of the poorer section are shot from behind within a month
 sabhi ko ek hi jagah ke aasapaas goli lagati he
 There is also a time to shoot
 sirf andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he ki in garib logon ko goli maarane vaale kaa makasad kya rahaa hoga
 If its intention is to create communal tension or it really is, then the government should take action immediately

 Mukesh Singh Sengar spoke to SP Greater Noida Ashish Srivastava
 unhone bhi mana kii aisi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai

 Naveen Bhati is a lawyer and also a Samajwadi Party leader
 sthaneey nivasee yaqub mallik ne shaq jataayaa he ki koi bhaichaare main aag daalana chahta he
 This incident of being shot in the same way raises many questions
 kya koi koshish kar rahaa he ki kisi ko uksaaya jaae, taaki usase bahes ho, tanaav ho or maahaul kharaab ho

 It can only be guessed that the motive of those who shot these poor people must have been
 agar uskaa iraadaa vaaki sapradayik tanaav paidaa karne kaa rahaa hoga yaa he to sarkaar ko turant ection lenaa chahie
 However, not a single arrest has been made in a month
 mukesh singh senger ne espi greater noida ashish shrivastav se baat kii
 They also believed that such incidents are happening
 hamalaa chah logon par hua tha
 Four cases have been filed because one happened on two people and one did not register a case
 ham chaahate the ki mukesh singh senger is maamle par apni tippanee den
 So you heard this incident has been happening since July 10
 naveen bhaati vakil hai or samaajawaadee party ke netaa bhi hai
 Local resident Yakub Mallick has expressed suspicion that someone wants to set fire to the brotherhood
 ek hi tarah se goli maare jane kii yah ghatana kai tarah ke sawaal paidaa karti he
 Is anyone trying to provoke someone, so that it is debated, tense and the atmosphere is spoiled
 hamaari bhi samaj se baahar he ki na to dushmani he, na lut paat he bas koi aata he or kisi ko goli markar bhaag jaataa he
 That too to the people of a community
 faizan, faiyaaz, irafaan, shaukeen, salmaan or afasaar ko kis baat ke liye goli maari gai he
 Mukesh Singh Sengar went to the Mewatian Mohalla of Dadri and the houses of these five people living in the new population who have been shot dead too
 ham aapako in sabhi paanch logon kii daastaan bataanaa chaahate hai
 Case number one
 silaai kaa kaam karne vaale faiyaaz ahamed kaam khatm kar raat ke saadhe das baje apane ghar laut rahe the
 57-year-old Fayaz had Rs 30,000 in his pocket when Dadri Main Road comes with two riders on the bike
 donon kaa cheharaa dhanka hota he or goli maar kar chale jate hai
 There is nothing, there is no loot of money
 ye pehali ghatana thi
 One must have felt that there is a general crime incident
 magar 9 agast tak isi tarah paanch logon ko peeche se goli maari jaati he, jisamen ek baccha bhi he
 On July 12, Mohammad Faizan, a 14-year-old studying in seventh grade, was returning home from Dad's meat shop
 vakt ho rahaa tha 9 baj kar 40 minute
 Two boys on the bike come, whose mouth was open
 bina baat ke faizan ko qamar main goli maarthe hai
 Exactly the way Fayyaz Ahmed was shot
 yah ghatana bhi dadri main road kii he
 So you saw that on July 10 and July 12, Faiz and Faizan are shot in the same way from behind
 koi jhagada nahin, koi dushmani nahin
 The third incident is on 14 July
 26 saal kaa irafaan apni kapade kii dukaan se nikal hi rahaa tha ki bike savaar aate hai or peeche se goli chalaate hai
 It was half past nine in the night
 andhere ke kaaran irfan batch gaya, use goli nahin lagi
 The family members did not even file a police complaint
 ab aate hai cese number chaar
 Let us tell you again that in Dadri area six people from a particular community have been shot from behind
 in chah main paanch ghayal hai or ek batch gaya he
 Mukesh Singh Sengar has investigated the case by visiting everyone's home
 cese number chaar kaa maamla he tees saal ke shaukeen kaa
 The fondant bails
 beldaari matlab kudaal chalaata he
 Extracts soil
 behad garib parivaar kaa he
 Shaukeen was returning after charging her mobile
 ghatana 22 july kii he or vakt vahi tha saadhe nau baj rahe the
 Accordingly, a bike comes fast
 jis par teen log savaar the
 He shot in the waist from behind
 isse pehle vah sanbhalta, hamalavar bhaag gaye
 Shaukeen's condition was critical, so he was brought to Safdarjung Hospital from Dadri
 vahaan se do teen din ke ilaaj ke baad waapas bhej diya gaya
 According to Mukesh Singh Sengar, Shaukeel was not in a very speaking position
 maa or chaar bhai mazaduri karte hai
 It is not being treated because there is no money
 mukesh ko laga ki shaukeen kii haalat acchhee nahi he
 It needs immediate medical attention because the infection is spreading rapidly
 shaukeen kii shaadi nahin hui he
 It does not even know much about the law that no one has gone to get a copy of the FIR from home
 jabaki is maamle main cese darj ho chukaa he
 So you have seen that the accounts of July 10, July 12, July 14 and July 22 have been recorded
 kaise ek hi samudaay ke logon ko qamar yaa qamar se neeche peeche se goli maari jaati he
 Now Mukesh Singh Sanger reaches case number five
 24 saal kaa salmaan or 30 saal kaa afasaar, ye donon eent ke bhatte main chalane vaale trakon ke driver hai
 On the night of 9 August, at 10:20, both of them left their homes
 ghar ke paas hi gali main paidal ja rahe the
 Then two boys came by bike, this time their face was not covered but due to the darkness, the face did not show
 salmaan or afasaar se koi baatcheet nahin, kahasuni nahin bas peeche se goli maar di
 In which 24-year-old Salman is shot behind the waist and Afsar is shot in the leg
 donon kaa ilaaj dadri main hi chal rahaa he
 Mukesh met Salman but not Afsar as he had gone to the hospital at that time
 afasaar kii maa se baat hui
 The comments garib tabake ke ek hi samudaay ke logon ko ek maheene ke bheetar peeche se goli maari jaati he
 Everyone is shot around the same place
 goli chalaane kaa vakt bhi ek sa he
 It can only be guessed that the motive of those who shot these poor people must have been
 agar uskaa iraadaa vaaki sapradayik tanaav paidaa karne kaa rahaa hoga yaa he to sarkaar ko turant ection lenaa chahie
 However, not a single arrest has been made in a month
 mukesh singh senger ne espi greater noida ashish shrivastav se baat kii
 They also believed that such incidents are happening
 hamalaa chah logon par hua tha
 Four cases have been filed because one happened on two people and one did not register a case
 ham chaahate the ki mukesh singh senger is maamle par apni tippanee den
 So you heard this incident has been happening since July 10
 naveen bhaati vakil hai or samaajawaadee party ke netaa bhi hai
 Local resident Yakub Mallick has expressed suspicion that someone wants to set fire to the brotherhood
 ek hi tarah se goli maare jane kii yah ghatana kai tarah ke sawaal paidaa karti he
 Is anyone trying to provoke someone, so that it is debated, tense and the atmosphere is spoiled
 hamaari bhi samaj se baahar he ki na to dushmani he, na lut paat he bas koi aata he or kisi ko goli markar bhaag jaataa he
 That too to the people of a community
 faizan, faiyaaz, irafaan, shaukeen, salmaan or afasaar ko kis baat ke liye goli maari gai he
 This was the first incident
 kisi ko bhi laga hoga ki saamaanya aparaadh kii ghatana he
 But till August 9, similarly five people are shot from behind, including a child
 12 july ko saatvin class main padhane vaala 14 saal kaa mohammad faizan pitaaji ke meet kii dukaan se ghar laut rahaa tha
 The time was 9:30 AM
 bike par savaar do ladke aate hai, jinka munh khulaa hua tha
 They shoot Faizan in the waist without talking
 thik usee tarah se jis tarah se faiyaaz ahamed ko goli maari gai thi
 This incident is also from Dadri Main Road
 to aapane dekha ki 10 july or 12 july ko faiyaaz or faizan ko ek hi tarah se peeche se goli maari jaati he
 No quarrel, no enmity
 teesri ghatana 14 july kii he
 26-year-old Irfan was leaving his clothes shop that bike riders come and shoot from behind
 raat ke saadhe nau baje the
 Irfan survived due to darkness, he was not shot
 gharavaalon ne dar kar maare police main shikaayat tak darj nahin karai
 Now comes case number four
 ham aapako phir se bataa den ki dadri ilaake main ek khaas samudaay ke chah logon ko peeche se goli maari gai he
 Five of these six are injured and one has survived
 mukesh singh senger ne har kisi ke ghar jaakar maamle kii padtaal kii he
 Case number four is a case of a thirty-year-old buff
 shaukeen beldaari karata he
 Bildari means hoe
 mitti nikaalata he
 Belongs to a very poor family
 shaukeen apana mobile charge karakar laut rahaa tha
 The incident took place on July 22 and it was only nine and a half
 iske anusaar tezi se ek bike aati he
 Three people were riding on it
 unhone peeche se qamar main goli maari
 Before that, Sambhalata, the attacker fled
 shaukeen kii haalat gambhir thi isliye use dadri se safadarajang aspataal laayaa gaya
 From there, he was sent back after two to three days of treatment
 mukesh singh senger ke anusaar shaukeel bahut bolne kii haalat main nahin tha
 Mother and four brothers work as laborers
 iskaa ilaaj nahin ho paa rahaa he kyonki paise nahi hai
 Mukesh felt that the fondness was not good
 ise turant behatar chikitsa kii zarurat he kyonki sankraman yani infections tezi se failata ja rahaa he
 Shaukeen is not married
 ise kanoon kii itani bhi jaankaree nahin he ki ghar se koi exiaar kii copy lene nahin gaya he
 While a case has been registered in this case
 to aapane abhi tak dekha ki 10 july, 12 july, 14 july or 22 july kii ghatana kaa hisaab
 How people of the same community are shot from the waist or waist from behind
 ab mukesh singh senger pahunchate hai cese number paanch par
 Salman, 24, and Afsar, 30, are both drivers of brick kiln trucks
 9 agast kii raat 10 bajkar 20 minute par apane ghar se donon hi saath nikle the
 Were walking on the street near the house
 tabhi do ladke bike se aae, is baar inkaa cheharaa dhanka nahin tha magar andhera hone ke kaaran cheharaa nahin dikhaa
 No conversation with Salman and Afsar, but not shot just shot from behind
 jisamen 24 saal ke salmaan ke qamar ke peeche goli lagati he or afasaar ke pair main goli lagati he
 Both are being treated in Dadri itself
 mukesh kii mulaakaat salmaan se hui magar afasaar se nahin kyonki vah us vakt aspataal gaya tha
 Talked with Afsar's mother
 tippaniyan People from the same section of the poorer section are shot from behind within a month
 sabhi ko ek hi jagah ke aasapaas goli lagati he
 There is also a time to shoot
 sirf andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he ki in garib logon ko goli maarane vaale kaa makasad kya rahaa hoga
 If its intention is to create communal tension or it really is, then the government should take action immediately
 vaise ek maheene main ek bhi giraftaar nahin hui he
 Mukesh Singh Sengar spoke to SP Greater Noida Ashish Srivastava
 unhone bhi mana kii aisi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai
 The attack took place on six people
 chaar cese darj hue hai kyonki ek main do logon par hua tha or ek ne cese hi darj nahin karaayaa
 We wanted Mukesh Singh Sengar to comment on the matter
 to aapane suna 10 july se yah ghatana ho rahi he
 Naveen Bhati is a lawyer and also a Samajwadi Party leader
 sthaneey nivasee yaqub mallik ne shaq jataayaa he ki koi bhaichaare main aag daalana chahta he
 This incident of being shot in the same way raises many questions
 kya koi koshish kar rahaa he ki kisi ko uksaaya jaae, taaki usase bahes ho, tanaav ho or maahaul kharaab ho
 It is beyond our comprehension that there is neither enmity nor robbery, just someone comes and shoots someone and runs away
 wo bhi ek samudaay ke logon ko
 Faizan, Fayyaz, Irrfan, Shaukeen, Salman and Afsar have been shot for what
 to aapane dekha ki 10 july or 12 july ko faiyaaz or faizan ko ek hi tarah se peeche se goli maari jaati he
