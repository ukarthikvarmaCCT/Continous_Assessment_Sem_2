 Jauhar was an activity performed by Rajput women in India in the olden times
 jab yuddh main haar nishchit ho jaati thi to purush mrityuparyant yuddh hetu taiyaar hokar veergati praapt karne nikal jate the tathaa striyaan johar kar leti thim arthath johar kunda main aag lagaakar khud bhi usamen kud jaati thi
 The reason for joining Jauhar was the fear of being defeated by the enemy king when he was defeated in the war
 pratham saaka; san 1303 main hua jab dilli ke sultan allaudin khilji ne ranthambhore vijay ke baad chittod ko aakraant kiya
 Alauddin Khilji's imperial ambition and Rana Ratan Singh's longing to get the queen Empress Padmini led to this attack
 doosraa saaka; san 1534-35 main hua jab gujarat ke sultan bahadurshah ne ek vishaal sena ke saath chittod par hamalaa kiya
 Hundreds of Veeranganas of Rajmata Rani Karnavati Durg sacrificed their lives by performing Jauhar rituals

 It is noted for the valor and sacrifice of Saka Jaimal and Fatta Sisodia
 jaisalmer main pehla saaka us samay hua jab dilli ke sultan allaudin khilji ne vishaal sena ke saath akraman kar durg ko gher liya tha
 In this, uncounted warriors including Bhati ruler Rawal Moolraj, Kunwar Ratan Singh took bath in Asidhara Tirtha and Lalnas performed rituals of Jauhar
 doosraa saaka firozshah tughlaq ke shashan ke praarambhik varshon main hua rawal duuda triloksee va anya bhaati saradaaron or yoddhaon ne shatru sena se ladate hue veergati pai or durgasth viranganaon ne johar kiya
 The third Saka is called Ardha Saka, in which the heroes did saffron but did not have Jauhar, so it is considered half Saka, this incident is in 1550 AD when Rao Lunkaran was the ruler of that place

 kisi bhugolic kshetra yaa jan samooh par satta yaa prabhutv ke sampoorn niyantran par anany adhikaar ko samprabhutaa kaha jaataa he
 The sovereign is the highest lawmaker and controller, that is, sovereignty is the supreme power of the state
 europe main aadhunik rajya ke udai ke parinamswaroop satrahavin sadi main 'samprabhutaa' kii avadharana kaa janm hua
 In European Europe, the power in European kingdoms and empires was divided between the king, the pope and the feudal lords
 pandrahavin or solahavin sadi main samantvaad ke tirohit hone or udhar protestant mat ke ubhaar ke kaaran catholic carch kii manyata main hraas hone se samprabhu rajyon ko panpane kaa mauka mila
 Sovereignty means 'total and unlimited power'
 lekin iske nihitarth itane sahaj nahin hai
 Just by this meaning it is not known what is involved in the structure of this entire power
 Does it mean any supreme statutory authority or is it related to a political power that cannot be challenged? samprabhutaa ke arth sambandhi isi tarah ke vivaadon ke kaaran unnisvin sadi se hi ise do bhaagon main baant kar samajha jaataa rahaa he : vidhik samprabhutaa or raajnneetik samprabhutaa
 This concept is also practically accepted as internal sovereignty and external sovereignty
 samprabhutaa ke aantarik sanskaran kaa matlab he rajya ke bheetar hone vaale satta ke bantwaare main yani raajnneetik pranali ke bheetar sarvocch satta kaa mukaam
 External version refers to the ability of the state to remain active as an independent and autonomous entity under the international system
 samprabhutaa kii avadharana aadhunik raashtra or rashtrawaad ke aadhaar main bhi nihit he
 Without the mixed influence of ideas of national independence, self-rule and sovereignty, one cannot imagine the process of de-colonization under which new nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America grew up largely after World War II
 Was created vidhik or raajnneetik samprabhutaa ke bich antar kaa ek bauddhik itihaas he jise samajhane ke liye jyaan bodaan or thomas hobbs ke tatsambandhit matbhedon par nazar daalani hogi
 Bodan, in his work The Six Books of Commonwealth, argues in favor of a sovereign who makes laws himself, but places himself above those laws
 is vichaar ke mutabik kanoon kaa arth he logon ko samprabhu ke aadesh par chalaanaa
 This does not mean that Boda wanted to advocate an autocratic ruler here
 unki manyata thi ki kanoon banane or unka anupaalan karaane vaala samprabhu shaasha ek ucchtar kanoon ke adheen rahegaa
 That is, the seal of divine law will be necessary on the authority of the temporal ruler
 bodaan ke is vichaar ke vipareet hobbs apni rachana levaythan main samprabhutaa ke vichaar kii vyakhya praadhikaar ke sandarbh main na karke satta ke sandarbh main karte hai
 Prior to Hobbes, St
 Augustine stressed the need for a sovereign who would control the moral evils inherent in humanity
 isi tark kaa or vikaas karte hue hobbs ne samprabhutaa ko damankaaree satta par ekadhikaar ke rup main paribhaashit karte hue sifaarish kii ki yah takat akele shaasha ke haath main honi chahie
 Although Hobbes preferred uninterrupted monarchy, he was also willing to believe that it could be in the hands of a small faction of rulers or a democratic assembly
 bodaan or hobbs ke bich kii yah bahes bataati he ki vidhik samprabhutaa rajya ke kanoon ko sarvopari maanane par tiki hui he
 In contrast, political sovereignty is linked to the actual distribution of power
 is fark ke baavjood yah bhi maananaa padegaa ki samprabhutaa kii vyaavhaarik dharna main vidhik pahalu bhi hote hai or raajnneetik bhi
 The sovereignty of modern states is also dependent on the supremacy of the law and on the power system that complies with the law, which has a repressive machinery
 koi bhi kanoon mahaz naitik baadhyataaon ke dam par lagu nahin hota
 It cannot be sustained without a system of punishment, police, jails and courts
 vidhik or raajnneetik samprabhutaa kaa yah sameekaran donon taraf se kargar hota dikhaai detaa he
 If the law requires a system of power for its compliance, then the power requires the recommendation of the law for its legitimacy
 shashan ko kanoonsammat or samvidhansammat hona padataa he, tabhi uski vaidhata kaayam rah paati he
 Only dictatorial governments work on the basis of political sovereignty
 agar sarkaar loktantric he to uski damankaaree mashinari ko kanoon kii simaaon main rah kar adaalaton ke sammukh javabdeh rahanaa padataa he
 The question of the internal nature of sovereignty has been much debated in the realm of political theory
 akhir sarvocch or aseemit satta kaa mukaam kya hona chahie? kya use kisi ek shaasha ke haath main rakhaa janaa shreyaskar hoga yaa uskaa centre kisi pratinidhitvamoolak sanstha main nihit hona behatar hoga? satrahavin sadi main frans ke samraat lui chaudaaven ne darp se kaha tha ki main hi rajya hoon
 The rationale behind giving sovereignty in the hands of a person is that in that case sovereignty will be guaranteed to be inseparable
 uski abhivyakti ek hi awaz main hogi or usamen koi doosraa praadhikaar hastkshep nahin kar paayegaa
 Effective interference in this totalitarian notion of sovereignty was done in the eighteenth century when jean-jacques Rousseau introduced the concept of popular sovereignty
 ruso ne rajshahi kii hukumat ko kaarij karte hue apni rachana soshal kantrect main likhaa : ‘manushya swatantra paidaa hota he, par har jagah vah zanjiron main jakadaaa hua he
 In fact, the social contract gives a new form to modern political philosophy
 unka saamaajik samjhauta hobbs or lock ke saamaajik samjhaute se alag he
 Philosophers prior to Rousseau believed that humans are different from other beings because of their intellectual abilities, while Rousseau believes that humans are different because of their ability to make moral choices
 agar use yah chunaav karne kii azaadi na di jaae to vah das se adhik kuch nahin rah jayega
 Since society is full of various freedoms, and man cannot return to the early world of his natural freedom, Rousseau suggests that he should exchange that freedom with civil liberties
 iske liye manushya ko ek-duusare se mil kar sanghathan bananaa hoga, saamaajik astitv rachana hoga jiske tahat sabhi log apane adhikaar tyaag denge or badale main naagarik ke rup main adhikaar praapt karenge, ek samprabhu ke sadsy ke rup main rahenge
 That is, a constitution will have to be made, under which every person will be subject and also a participating citizen
 keval isi tarah swatantraaa kii guarantee kii ja sakegi
 This was the concept of democracy, but the Russo did not agree with democracy or law-making run by the representatives of the people
 pracheen yunaan ke pratyaksh loktantr kii tarah ruso chaahate the ki sabhi naagarik ek saarvajanik sthaan par jamaa ho kar vidhi nirmaan karen
 To save the minority from being subject to the decision taken by the majority, Rousseau favored a consensus which formulated his most well-known principle 'public will' to make it effective
 ‘jan-ichha’ ke aadhaar par rache gayi kanoon ke paalan kaa matlab tha swayan apni ichha kaa paalan karnaa
 The principle of 'public will' introduced by Russo later became the basis of modern democratic theory
 ruso ne aise nagarikon ke sahaj samudaay kalpana kii thi jo oonch- neech ke sambandhon se pare samanta or ekta ke vaahak honge, isliye unhen vishwaas tha ki unke bich main ‘jan-ichha’ uplabdh karnaa aasaan hoga
 But Rousseau could never answer the question of how the 'journal-will' would come out of the wishes expressed in the general assembly of citizens
 isliye ant main ve yah kehete hue nazar aaye ki agar ‘jan- ichha’ nahin uplabdh ho paa rahi he to bahumat kii ichha ko hi uskaa paryaay maan liya janaa chahie
 The principle of sovereignty has also been taken up by the advocates of liberal-democratic thought
 unka kahana he ki bahultavaadi or loktantric shashan ke sandarbh main samprabhutaa kii dharna anaavashyak he
 These people consider the idea of sovereignty as suffering from its totalitarian past and therefore undesirable
 unka kahana he ki loktantric sarkarein damankaaree mashinari dwaara thope jane vaale kathith rup se vidhisammat shashan dwaara nahin chalatin
 They rule through an equation of control and balance and a network based on it
 darasal, sanghatmak charitra vaale aadhunik rajyon main aantarik samprabhutaa kaa centre tay karnaa bahut mushkil he
 In federal states such as the United States, Canada, Australia and India, the government is divided into two levels and each level has its own autonomous powers
 is prakaar ke rajyon main samprabhutaa centre or paridhi ke bich saajhedaari ke rup main ubhartee he
 In such a situation, if there is an undivided sovereign then it is the constitution which makes the center also sovereign and the states as well
 bahya samprabhutaa antarrashtriya vyavastha main kisi rajya kii haisiyat kii dyotak he
 There are also situations that the internal sovereignty of a state continues to be disputed, but its external sovereignty is respected in the international arena
 vaise bhi loktantron ke yug main aantarik samprabhutaa ke masale ab itane zyaada ahm nahin maane jate, par bahya samprabhutaa kaa prashn pehle se kahin zyaada mahatvapurn ho chukaa he
 There are many international disputes in which the claim of sovereignty of one country is seen as a challenge to its sovereignty from another country
 philistiniyon dwaara apane samprabhu raashtra ke liye chalaaya jane vaala andolan isroyal ko apni samprabhutaa ke kshay kaa kaarak lagata he

 sicyor shail ek asurakshit network par surakshit rup se oparating network sevaaon ke liye ek kryptographic network protocol he
 The best known example is for remote login on computer systems by application users
 esaech ek esaech sarwar ke saath esaech client aplication ko jodne, client-sarwar architekchar main ek asurakshit network par ek surakshit channel pradaan karata he
 Common applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH
 protocol vinirdesh do pramukh sanskarnon ke bich antar karata he, jise esaech -1 or esaech -2 kaha jaataa he
 The most visible application of the protocol is for accessing shell accounts on Unix-like operating systems, but it also sees some limited usage on Windows
 2015 main, microsoft ne ghoshnaa kii ki bhavishya main relies main esaech ke liye mul samarthan shaamil hoga
 SSH was designed to replace Telnet and for unprotected remote shell protocols such as Berkeley Ragin, RSP, and rexac protocols
 ve protocol sade text main jaankaree, vishesh rup se password bhejte hai, jo packet vishleshan kaa upyog karke avrodh or prakatikaran ke liye atisamvedansheel hote hai
 The encryption used by SSH is intended to provide the confidentiality and integrity of data over unsecured networks such as the Internet, although leaked files by Edward Snowden indicate that the National Security Agency can sometimes decrypt SSH, allowing them to Allows read content of SSH sessions
 
 On 6 July 2017, government transparency organization wikileaks confirmed that the US Central Intelligence Agency had developed tools that could be installed on computers running Microsoft Windows or GNU / Linux operating systems to start on systems compromised by SSH customers SSH connection made can be stopped! paribhaasha SSH uses public key cryptography to authenticate remote computers and, if necessary, allow the user to authenticate
 esaech kaa upyog karne ke kai tareeke hai; ek network conection ko ancript karne ke liye swachaalit rup se jenerate kiye gaye saarvajanik-nijee kunjee jode kaa upyog karnaa he, or phir log on karne ke liye password pramanikaran kaa upyog karnaa he
 Another is to use a manually generated public-private key pair to perform authentication, allowing users or programs to log in without specifying a password
 is paridrishy main, koi bhi vibhinn kunjee kii milan karne vaali jodi utpann kar saktaa he
 The public key is placed on all computers that must allow access to the owner of the matching private key
 jabaki pramanikaran nijee kunjee par aadhaarit he, pramanikaran ke dauraan kunjee ko network ke madhyam se kabhi bhi sthanantarit nahin kiya jaataa he
 SSH only verifies if the same person offering the public access is the owner of the matching private key
 esaech ke sabhi sanskarnon main agyaat saarvajanik kunjee ko satyapit karnaa mahatvapurn he, yani unhen maanya ke rup main sweekaar karne se pehle, saarvajanik kunjee ko pahchaan ke saath sambhddha karen
 Accepting an attacker's public key without verification would authorize an unauthorized attacker as a legitimate user
 mukhya prabandhan On systems such as Unix, the list of authorized public keys is typically stored in the home directory of the user who is allowed to remotely log into the file ~ / 
ssh / authorized_ keys
 yah fil keval esaech dwaara sammanit he yadi yah maalik or root ke alaava kisi bhi cheez se likhane yogya nahin he
 When the public key is present at the remote end and the matching private key is present at the local end, the password does not require typing in the stack
 This password needs to be well)
 haalanki, atirikt suraksha ke liye nijee kunjee ko pasfrez se lock kiya ja saktaa he
 The private key can also be viewed in standard locations, and its full path can be specified as a command line setting
 esaech-kijen upyogita hameshaa jodon main saarvajanik or nijee kunjee banaati he
 SSH also supports password-based authentication that is encrypted with an automatically generated key
 is maamle main, hamalavar vaid sarwar paksh kii nakal kar saktaa he, password maang saktaa he, or ise praapt kar saktaa he 
 However, this is only possible if the two parties have never authenticated before, as SSH remembers the key that previously used the server
 esaech client ek nae, pehle agyaat sarwar kii kunjee sweekaar karne se pehle ek chetavanee uthaata he
 Password authentication can be disabled prayog SSH is commonly used to log into a remote machine and execute commands, but it supports tunneling, forwarding TCP ports and X11 connections; It can transfer files using the corresponding SSH file transfer or secure copy protocol
 SSH client-sarwar model kaa upyog karata he Standard TCP port 22 is assigned to contact the SSH server
 ek esaech client program aamtaur par remote conection sweekaar karne vaale esaech dimen se conection sthapit karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Both typically exist on most modern operating systems, including macos, most distributions of Linux, openbsd, freebsd, netbsd, Solaris, and openvms

 These wars took place between Mohammad Ghauri and Ajmer and Prithvi Raj III, the Chauhan Rajput ruler of Delhi

 1191 main unhen prithvi raaj tritiy ke netritv main rajputon kii milijuli sena ne jise kannauj or banaras vartmaan main varanasi ke raja jayachand kaa bhi samarthan praapt tha
 Prithviraj Chauhan's sharp eyes on the expansion and order of his empire were always frozen
 ab unki ichha punjab tak vistaar karne kii thi
 But at that time, Punjab was ruled by Mohammad Ghauri
 1190 i0 tak sampoorn punjab par mohammad gauri kaa adhikaar ho chukaa tha
 Now he used to run his rule from Bhatinda
 prithviraj yah baat bhalee bhaanti jaanata tha ki mohammad gauri se yuddh kiye bina punjab main chouhan samrajya sthapit karnaa asambhav tha
 Considering this, he decided to deal with Gauri
 apane is nirnay ko moort rup dene ke liye prithviraj ek vishaal sena lekar punjab kii or ravaanaa ho gaya
 Taking swift action, he took possession of the forts of Hansi, Saraswati and Sirhind
 isi bich use soochna mili ki anhilwara main vidrohiyon ne unke viruddh vidroh kar diya he
 From Punjab, he moved to Anheelwada
 unke peeth peeche gauri ne akraman karke sarhind ke kile ko pun: apane kabje main le liya
 Prithviraj soon crushed the revolt of Anahilvada
 ab usne gauri se nirnaayak yuddh karne kaa nirnay liya
 He equipped his army in a new way and went to war
 raavi nadi ke tat par prithviraj ke senapati khet singh khangaar kii sena main bhayankar yuddh hua parantu kuch parinaam nahin niklaa
 Seeing this, Prithviraj proceeded to teach Gauri a lesson
 thaneshwar se 14 mile dur or sarhind ke kile ke paas tarin naamak sthaan par yah yuddh ladaa gaya
 In this first war of Tarain, the Rajputs delivered sixes of Gauri's army
 gauri ke sainik praan bachaa kar bhaagane lage
 The person who escaped survived, but the one who came in front was cut like a carrot and radish
 sultan mohammad gauri yuddh main buree tarah ghayal hua
 With his tall Turkish horse, he was about to fall into an injured state, when the sight of one of his fighting soldiers fell on him
 usne badi furti ke saath sultan ke ghode kii kaman sambhaal lee or kud kar gauri ke ghode par chadh gaya or ghayal gauri ko yuddh ke maidan se nikaal kar le gaya
 The army of the headless Sultan was in a tizzy
 turk sainik rajput sena ke saamne bhaag khadey hue
 Prithviraj's army followed these fleeing Turks for 80 miles
 par turk sena ne waapas aane kii himmat nahin kii
 Prithviraj Chauhan received a wealth of Rs 7 crore from this victory
 is dhan smapda ko usne apane bahadur sainiko main baant diya
 With this victory, Prithviraj's rage froze throughout India and the story of his bravery, patience and courage began to be told
 prithviraj chouhan dwaara rajkumaari sanyogita kaa haran karke is prakaar kannauj se le janaa raja jayachand ko buree tarah kachot rahaa tha
 His heart was piercing with sharp arrows of insult
 vah kisi bhi keemat par prithviraj kaa vidhwans chahta tha
 Even if he has to do anything
 vishwasaneey sutron se use pataa chalaa ki mohammad gauri prithviraj se apni paraajay kaa badla lenaa chahta he
 What was it just like Jaichand got the wish of his mind
 usne gauri kii sahaayta karke prithviraj ko samaapt karne kaa man banaaya
 Jaichand could not dare to fight Prithviraj alone
 usne sochaa is tarah prithviraj bhi samaapt ho jaayegaa or dilli kaa rajya usko puraskaar swaroop de diya jaayegaa
 King Jayachand's eyes were covered with a veil of vengeance and selfishness that he had lost the pride of his country and caste
 raja jayachand ke deshadroh kaa parinaam yah hua kii jo mohammad gauri tarin ke yuddh main apni haar ko bhula nahin paaya tha, vah phir prithviraj kaa muqaabala karne ke shadyantra karne laga
 King Jaichand sent messengers and assured of military assistance to Gauri 
 deshadrohi jayachand kii sahaayta paa kar gauri turant prithviraj se badla lene ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 When Prithviraj got the information that Gauri was once again busy in the preparations for war, then he had no effect
 mohammad gauri kii sena se mukaabal karne ke liye prithviraj ke mitra or raaj kavi chandbardaai ne anek rajput raajaaon se sainya sahaayta kaa anurodh kiya parantu sanyogita ke haran ke kaaran bahut se rajput raja prithviraj ke virdohi ban chuke the ve kannauj naresh ke sanket par gauri ke paksh main yuddh karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 In 1192, once again Prithviraj and Gauri's army stood face to face in the battle of Tarain
 donon or se bheeshan yuddh shuru ho gaya
 In this war, 3 lakh soldiers from Prithviraj participated while Gauri had one lakh twenty thousand soldiers
 gauri kii sena kii vishesh baat ye thi kii uske paas shaktishaalee ghudsavaar dasta tha
 Prithviraj aggressively attacked Gauri's army
 us samay bhartiya sena main hathi ke dwaara sainya prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Gauri's horsemen went ahead and surrounded the elephants of the Rajput army and started raining arrows on them
 ghayal hathi na to aage bad paae or na peeche balki unhone ghabara kar apni hi sena ko rondana shuru kar diya
 The biggest tragedy of Tarain's Second War was that Rajput soldiers were killing their Rajput brothers at the behest of the traitor Jayachand
 doosraa prithviraj kii sena raat ke samay akraman nahin karti thi lekin turk sainik raat ko bhi akraman karke markat machaa rahe the
 As a result, Prithviraj was defeated in this war and he and Raj Kavi Chandbardai were taken captive
 deshadrohi jayachand kaa isse bhi bura haal hua, usko maar kar kannauj par adhikaar kar liya gaya
 With the defeat of Prithviraj, Gauri became the authority over Delhi, Kannauj, Ajmer, Punjab and entire India
 bharat main islamic rajya sthapit ho gaya
 Gauri, Prithviraj and Chandbardai went to their home state Gaur as prisoners of war, making their worthy commander Qutbuddin Aibak as governor of India

 Additionally, production engineering companies are essentially required to develop, manage and communicate information about their products
 pielem ke ek rup ko lok-kendrit pielem kaha jaataa he
 While traditional PLM devices are implemented only when released or during the release phase, the folk-focused PLM is targeted at the design stage
 haalia isiti vikaas dwaara vittposhit promis pariyojna 2004-2008) ne pielem ko paaramparik pielem ke aage vistaarit karne or samvedak ke data va vaastavik samay ke 'jeevanchakra ghatana data' ko pielem main ekikrut karne tathaa saath hi, ek ekal utpaada ke sakal jeevanchakra main vibhinn khilaadiyon tak yah soochna uplabdh karwaane kii anumati pradaan kii he
 This has resulted in the expansion of PLM into a closed loop lifecycle management / closed loop lifecycle management
 utpaada jeevanchakra prabandhan ke pralekhith laabhon main shaamil hai: There are mainly five primary areas within PLM; dhyaan den: jab pielem prakriyaaon ke liye anuprayog software kii aavashyaktaa na ho, to vyapaarik jatilta or parivartan kii dar ke liye aavashyak hota he ki sanghathan yathasambhav tivrata se kriyanvit hon
 Systems engineering focuses on the fulfillment of all requirements, primarily the needs of the consumer, and the synergy of the system design process incorporating all relevant disciplines

 However, to get the full benefit of PLM, an extended enterprise requires the participation of many individuals with different skills, each with the ability to access and work on the input and output of other participants
 
 pielem upkarnon ke prayog kii saralata badhane ke baavjood, sabhi karmiyon ko sampurna pielem upkaran-samucchy par antahprashikshan dena vyaavhaarik sabit nahin hua he
 However, now some improvements are being made under the PLM area keeping in mind the ease of use for all the participants
 vishisht prayokta interphes kii 'bhoomika nibhaane' kii kshamta aisa hi ek sudhaar he
 Due to the customizable UI that can be created according to the needs of the users, the orders presented to the users are suitable according to their function and expertise
 pielem dwaara anek sthapit kaary-paddatiyon ko apanaaya gaya he va aage unamem or adhik sudhaar kiya gaya he
 With PLM digital engineering techniques, improvements have been made to meet the company's goals, such as reduced time to market and lower production costs

 These techniques include: samavarti ejineering ) ek karypravah he, jo vibhinn charnon ke madhyam se krmanugat rup se kai kaary karne ke bajaay samanaantar rup se karata he
 For example: starting the actual device design before the detailed design of the product is complete, or introducing the detailed design concrete model before the concept design surface model is completed
 haalanki iske dwaara kisi pariyojna ke liye lagane vaali maanav-shakti kii maatra main kami aana aavashyak nahin he, lekin yah aavashyak samay ko tathaa is kaaran bazaar tak pahunchane main lagane vaale samay ko bhi atyadhik kam kar detaa he
 Characteristic-based CAD systems have for many years allowed 3D solid models and 2D models to work together through two separate files, in which the drawing follows the data of the model; When the model changes, the image attached to it will also be updated or updated
 kuch cad package, filon ke bich jyamiti kii sahachaari nakal kii bhi anumati dete hai
 This, for example, allows a part design to be copied into files used by the instrument designer
 iske baad utpaadan ejeeniyar antim charan ke rukne se purv hi upkarnon par kaary prarambh kar saktaa he; jab ek dizine ke aakaar yaa banaavat main parivartan hota he, to upkaran jyamiti ko adyatit kiya jayega
samavarti ejineering ke saath vibhaagon ke bich behatar va adhik sheeghra samvaad kaa laabh judaa hota he, jisase mahange or vilambit dizine parivartanon kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 It adopts a problem solving method compared to the problem solving and reconstruction method of traditional sequential engineering
 bottm-ap dizine kendrit) vah dizine he, jisamen kisi utpaada ke 3di modelon kii paribhaasha ekal ghatakon ke nirmaan ke saath prarambh hoti he
 They are then seamlessly brought together into more than one level of sub-assemblies until the entire product is digitally defined
 This is sometimes referred to as a review structure reflecting what the product will look like
 bioem samast bhautik ghatakon se milakar bana hota he; isamen sambhawatah antim utpaada bioem, jaise paint, saresh, tel tathaa anya samagriyaan bhi ho saktin hai, jinhen aamtaur par 'thok vasteen' kaha jaataa he
 Bulk objects typically have weights and numbers, but they are not always replicated according to geometry
 bottm-ap dizine vaastavik-vishwa kii uplabdh bhautik praudyogiki kii kshamtaaon par kendrit hota he va un samaadhaanon ko kriyanvit karata he, jinke liye yah praudyogiki sarvaadhik upyukt hoti he
 When these bottom-up solutions have any significance in the real-world, bottom-up designs can be a lot more efficient than top-down designs
 bottm-ap dizine main jokhim yah he ki kam-mahatv vaali samasyaon ke liye yah bahut adhik dakshatapurvak samaadhaan pradaan karata he
 Bottom-up design focuses on "what can we do most efficiently with this technology?" Not like the top-down, which focuses on "what is the most important thing to be done?" top down dizine ucch-stareey kaaryaatmak aavashyaktaaon par kendrit hota he or isamen vartmaan kriyanvayan praudyogiki par apekshaakrit kam dhyaan diya jaataa he
 a top-level specification is decomposed into lower and lower-level structures and specifications until we reach the physical implementation level
 The risk of top-down design is that it will not take advantage of the most efficient applications of current physical technology, especially in terms of hardware implementation
 jab top-down model ne kisi aise sankshepan path kaa prayog kiya ho, jo uplabdh bhautik-stareey praudyogiki main dakshatapurvak samahit na hota ho, kabhi-kabhi top-down dizine kaa parinaam nimnatar-stareey sankshepan ke atyadhik staron or adaksh pradarshan ke rup main miltaa he
 The positive side of top-down design is that it keeps its focus on optimal solution requirements
 top-down dizine ke kuch jokhimon ko ek bhaag-kendrit top-down dizine ke dwaara hataaya ja saktaa he
 It begins with a layout model, often a simple 2D diagram defining basic shapes and some key deterministic parameters
 audyogic dizine utpaada vikaas main rachanaatmak vichaar paidaa karata he
 Here the geometry is copied colloquially to the next level, representing the various subsystems of the product
 iske baad up-tantron kii jyamiti kaa prayog nichle staron par adhik vivaranon ko paribhaashit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Depending on the complexity of the product, multiple levels of this assembly are maintained until basic definitions of components, such as position and key dimensions, can be identified
 iske baad ghatak filon par is soochna kii pratilipi sahachaari rup se banaai jaati he
 In these files, there is a detailed description of the components; This is where the traditional bottom-up assembly begins
 kabhi-kabhi top-down assembly ko ek niyantran sanrachana kaha jaataa he
 If a single file is used to define the layout and parameters for the review structure, it is often called a scalediton file
 paaramparik rup se raksha ejineering utpaada sanrachana ko top-down vidhi se viksit karti he
 Systems engineering determines a functional disintegration of process requirements and then physical allocation of product structure to tasks
 saamanytah is top-down vidhi main bottm-ap sanrachana yaa dizine ke rup main cad data se viksit utpaada sanrachana ke nimnatar str honge
 both-and-against-the-middle) design is a design process that seeks to combine the best features of top-down design and bottom-up design into a single process
 ek beietm dizine prakriya kaa pravaah ek ubhartee praudyogiki ke saath prarambh ho saktaa he, jo moolyawaan samaadhaanon kaa suzav de sakati ho athwa yah kisi aisi samasya ke top-down drushtikon ke saath bhi shuru ho saktaa he, jiske liye kisi samaadhaan kii aavashyaktaa ho
 In any case, the main feature of the BEATM design methodology is to quickly focus on both ends of the design process: a top-down approach to solution requirements and any technology that promises to deliver an efficient solution , Bottom-up approach of
 The BEATM design process moves from both ends in search of an optimal merger at some point between top-down requirements and bottom-up efficient implementation
 is prakaar, beietm eemaandaaree se donon kaary-paddatiyon ke sarvshereshth gun prastut karata rahaa he
 Indeed, many top-down or bottom-up success stories have been successful only because of unconscious experimentation, derived from an intuition of the BEATM methodology
 yadi sachet rup se prayog kiya jaae, to beietm or bhi adhik shaktishaalee laabh pradaan karata he
 The next step is to take the top-down design to the next step
 purna niyantran sanrachana or samiksha sanrachana tathaa saath hi nimna-stareey data jaise chitra, upkaran vikaas or cam model kaa nirmaan utpaada ko paribhaashit kiye jane se purv yaa ek pariyojna kii shuruyaat ko praadhikrut kiye jane se purv kiya jaataa he
 These assemblies of files form a template from which a range of products can be created
 jab nae utpaada ke saath jane kaa nirnay le liya gaya ho, to utpaada ke maapdand is template model main pravisht kiye jate hai or isse sambandhit sabhi data ko adhyatan kiya jaataa he
 Naturally predetermined collaborative models will not be able to predict all possibilities and will require additional work
 mukhya siddhant yah he ki anek prayogtmak / anusandhanatmak kaary pehle hi purna kiye ja chuke hai
 a lot of knowledge is built into these templates, which have to be reused in new products
 iske liye atirikt "agrim" sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, lekin yah pariyojna kii shuruyaat or vimochan ke bich ke samay ko bahut adhik gata saktaa he
 However these types of methods require organizational changes because typical engineering efforts are sent to "offline" development departments
 ise bhavi utpaadon ke liye kisi nai praudyogiki kaa pareekshan karne hetu ek concept car kaa nirmaan karne ke samaan samajha ja saktaa he, lekin is sthiti main kaary ko pratyaksh rup se utpaadon kii agali peedi ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Single components cannot be constructed separately
 CAD of components; Cade models are designed with reference to any part or whole of the product being developed
 ise asembli modelling takneekon kaa prayog karke hasil kiya jaataa he
 The geometry of the other components can be seen in the context of the CAD equipment being used
 ek up-asembli ke antargat anya ghatak usee system main banaae gaye yaa na banaae gaye ho sakate hai, jisamen unki jyamiti anya sipidi praroopon se anuvaadit kii ja sakati he
 An assembly check, such as a DMU, is conducted using product visualization software
 utpaada or prakriya jeevanchakra prabandhan ) pielem kaa ek vaikalpik prakaar he jisamen utpaada ke nirmaan ke liye prayukt prakriya ko bhi utana hi mahatvapurn banaaya jaataa he, jitna ki utpaada mahatvapurn he
 In particular, it is a market of life-long and advanced specialty chemicals
 kisi diye gayi yogic ke utpaadan kii prakriya ek nai dawa ke liye kiye jane vaale niamak nivedan kaa ek mukhya tatv hota he
 Thus, PPLM attempts to manage information related to the development of a process in the same way that PLM talks about managing information related to the development of a baseline product

 Google Chrome is a web browser created by Google with open source code
 iskaa naam graphical yuzar interfes ke frem yani krom par rakhaa gaya he
 The project is named Chromium and is released under BSD license
 2 sitambar, 2008 ko google krom kaa 43 bhashaaon main microsoft windos prachaalan tantra hetu beta sanskaran jari kiya gaya
 This new browser will be based on open source Linux code, which will also allow third party developers to create compatible applications
 google krom ko behatar suraksha, behatar gati evam sthayitv ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaya gaya tha
 The most prominent feature of Chrome is its speed and application performance
 iske beta sanskaran ko march 2009 main launch kiya gaya tha
 New features added to this version include Form autocomplete, Full Page Zoom, Auto Scroll and a new type of drag tab
 is broujar kii website ke anusaar, dekhne main ye paramparaagat google mukhaprishth kii tarah he or tej tathaa spasht he
 Using Google Chrome, like other browsers, does not open a blank page directly, but rather shows a thumbnail view of the last few webpages most used by the browser user, which when clicked opens the desired page
 is kaaran se upayokta apane manavaanchit prishthon par sheeghra hi nevigate kar paata he
 The advantage of omnibox available in it is that you can search Google without opening Google
 udhaaharan ke liye adress baar main maatr olympic daalate hi usase sambandhit website ke pate bataa detaa he, saath hi adhure or galat paton ko ricover karne kii suvidha bhi isamen he
 The task manager icon present in this browser can provide information about how much memory is being used in which process
 iske saath hi yadi koi website nahin chal rahi to usase duusari site par fark nahin padataa he
 It also asks the user if he wants to come back to the same page or open a new page when the computer system is suddenly shut down and then opened by crash recovery
 incognito ke kaaran upayokta ypi adress li nahin hota jisase suraksha bad jaati he
 There are some sites where for the first time loading something will take less time, then the number of times it will increase
 prayek site ko usko surf karne vaale ke bare main jaankaree uske ypi adress se milti he
 Chrome uses the tab system just like the Opera web browser
 is teb pranali main zyada prayog kii gayi websiton kaa yah apane aap itihaas banaakar naye teb main jodta chalaa jaataa he
 As soon as you click on the new tab, it automatically displays the saved pages in the box
 isse purv pasandida saiton ko naye teb main sahejkar rakhane kii yah suvidha keval opera ke broujar main milti thi
 The biggest drawback so far supported by Google was that the default search engine was Google, which lacked the features of Gmail etc
 directly from the homepage
 baad main ai
i-7 main ekasaath kai saare hompej banaakar rakhane kii suvidha mili thi
 But its drawback is its slow pace
 bharat main 128 capibies speed ko broadband speed kaha jaataa he, jabaki pashchim ke deshon main 1 embipies kii speed broadband kii shrenee main aati he
 The average Internet consumer works at this speed
 chote shaharon or gramin ilaakon main to yah speed 76 capibies maatr hi hoti he
 In this case, EE-7 is very slow
 yahaan opera, safari or firefaks is lihaaj se kuch behatar hai lekin itani kam speed par koi bhi broujar thik se kaam nahin kar saktaa
 For this reason, IE-6 has been used more
 krom ke prayog karte hue broujar ke upar koi pattee nahin dikhaai detii he jis par fil, edit or vikalp ke batan hote the
 The exact reason for removing it is not known, but this increases the size of the window considerably
 14-15 inch kaa monitor prayog karte hue bhi behatar vijabilti milti he
 Yes, some options could be selected by clicking directly, for which it has to resort to some shortcut keys
 krom main ek kami he ki isamen mouse ke daayen clic par rifresh kaa vikalp nahin miltaa he
 There is also a goodness with this deficiency, that is the secret page
 yadi bina record kii sarfing kerani ho to google gupt vindo kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 Google recently released a beta version of the third version of the Chrome browser
 is krom main ekstansion saport pehle se hi chaalu hote he

 Although bookkeeping and accounting are not compulsory for a businessman, but without this they cannot carry out their work successfully and they are not even aware of the profit or loss from their business activities
 lekhe rakhane kii kriya kisi na kisi rup main us samay se vidyaman he jab se vyavsaay kaa janm hua he
 a very small businessman can keep accounts in the brain by recourse to memorisation, another can provide written form on paper
 vyavasthit rup se lekha rakhaa jaye yaa avyavasthit rup se, yah lekhankan hi kahalaayegaa
 As the size of the business grew and the nature of the business became increasingly complex accounting began to take shape

 The size of modern business has grown so much that hundreds, thousands and thousands of business transactions take place in it

 Therefore, systematic records of these transactions are kept and their systematic knowledge and experimentation is called accounting
 lekhashastra ke vyaavhaarik rup ko lekhankan kah sakate hai
 According to the Bulletin, the accounting terminology of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, "accounting for behaviors and events that are at least partly financial in nature, effectively writing, classifying and summarizing money as a currency and the consequences thereof
" Is the art of explaining
 ’’ According to this definition accounting is an art, not a science
 is kala kaa upyog vittiya prakruti ke mudra main maapneey vyavhaaron or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan, vargeekaran, sankshepan or nirvachan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Smith and Ashburn have presented the above definition with some improvement
 unke anusaar ‘lekhankan mukhyatah vittiya prakruti ke vyavsaayik lendenon or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan tathaa vargeekaran kaa vigyaan he or un lendeene or ghatnaon kaa mahatvapurn saransh banane, vishleshan tathaa vyakhya karne or parinaamon ko un vyaktiyon ko sampreshit karne kii kala he, jinhen nirnay lene hai
 According to this definition, accounting is both science and art
 kintu yah ek purna nishchit vigyaan na hokar lagbhag purna vigyaan he
 The American Accounting Principles Board has defined accounting as a service action
 uske anusaar, ‘lekhankan ek seva kriya he
 Its function is to give consequential information of financial nature mainly about financial units which is useful in making economic decisions by rational selection in alternative behavioral actions
 ’ Based on the above considerations, accounting can be called the art of writing, presenting, interpreting and informing the transactions of the financial nature of the business in a definite, structured and well planned manner
 sarvapratham praarambhik lekhankan ke record pracheen babylon, asyria or sumeria ke khandhar main paae gaye, jo 7000 varshon se bhi pehle kii taarikh ke hai
 The people of the time relied on ancient accounting methods to record the growth of crops and cattle

 Based on the above definitions of accounting, the following characteristics are clear - lekhankan ek kala or vigyaan donon he
 In the form of art, it helps to know the financial result
 isamen abhilikhit tathaa vargeekrut len-denon or ghatnaon kaa saransh taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 They are analyzed and interpreted
 vittiya samankon kaa vishleshan evam nirvachan lekhankan kii kala hi he jiske liye vishesh gyaan, anubhav or yogyata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Similarly, conveying the meaning of financial data to the internal and external aspects of a business and its changes in such a way that they can take wise decisions in relation to business, is the art of accounting
 vigyaan ke rup main yah ek vyavasthit gyaan shakha he
 It has definite rules for recording, categorizing and summarizing transactions and events
 in nishchit niyamon ke kaaran hi lekhon kaa krambaddh va vyavasthit rup se abhilekhan kiya jaataa he
 But it is not a 'completely definite' science, but an 'almost perfect science'
 lekhankan main mudra main maapan yogya vittiya prakruti kii ghatnaon or vyavhaaron kaa hi lekha kiya jaataa he
 Practices that are not financial in nature are not accounted for in books
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek sanstha ke paas samarpit va vishwasaneey karmchaariyon kii ek toli ho jo vyavsaay ke liye bahut upyogi he, kaa lekha vyavsaay kii pustakon main nahin kiya jaayegaa kyonki yah vittiya prakruti kii nahin he tathaa ise mudra main abhivyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Accounting is a service function according to the board's definition of accounting principles
 iskaa uddeshy vyavsaayik kriyaaon ke bare main parimanatmak vittiya suchanaaen uplabdh karana he
 The final product of accounting, ie the financial statement, is useful to those who make decisions about alternative functions
 lekhankan swayan kisi dhan kaa srijan nahin karata he, yadhyapi yah iske upyogkartaaon ko upyogi soochna uplabdh karaata he jo inhen dhan ke srijan evam rakh rakhaav main sahaayak hota he
 The main objectives of accounting are as follows - prayek vyavsaayik len-dein ko pustakon main krambaddh tareeke se likhnaa va uchit hisaab rakhana lekhankan kaa pratham uddeshy he
 In the absence of accounting, there would be a lot of burden on human memory which in most cases would have been impossible to bear
 vidhivat abhilekhan se bhul va chal-kapaton ko dur karne main sahaayta milti he
 Accounting protects against improper and undesirable use of business assets
 aisa lekhankan dwaara prabandh ko nimna suchanaaen pradaan karne ke kaaran sambhav hota he - The above information helps the business owner to know that the funds of the business are not unnecessarily idle
 lekhankan avadhi ke ant main vyavsaay sanchaalan ke falswaroop utpann shuddh laabh athwa haani kaa nirdhaaran lekhankan kaa pramukh uddeshy he
 There is a difference between net profit or loss and some proceeds of certain duration and some expenses
 yadi aagmon kii raashi adhik he to shuddh laabh hoga tathaa vipareet paristhiti main shuddh haani
 It is an indicator of managerial skills and business progress
 yahi anshadhariyon main labhaansh vitaran kaa aadhaar hota he
 The information provided by the profit and loss account is not sufficient
 vyavsaayee apni vittiya sthiti bhi jaananaa chahta he
 This is accomplished by letter
 chittha ek vishesh tithi ko vyavsaay kii sampattiyon evam dayitvon kaa vivaran he
 It acts as a barometer in knowing the financial health of the business
 vivekpurna nirnay lene ke liye sambandhit adhikariyon evam sanstha main hit rakhane vaale vibhinn pakshakaron ko vaanchit soochna uplabdh karana, lekhankan kaa uddeshy he
 The American Accounting Association has also given special emphasis to this point while defining accounting
 unke anusaar, The first task of accounting is to systematically and methodically accounting all business deals and events in the journal
