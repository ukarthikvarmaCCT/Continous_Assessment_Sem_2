purv anubhag ke parinaam ke saath ve vidhiyaan jo raikhik, sthirataa or kosi gunanfal kaa anusaran karti hai, shrenee 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 


 or shrenee 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 kii sankalaniyata main samanarthkata main anternihit hoti hai
 The Sisaira theorem is a simple example
 shrenee 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 


 yadi durbaltah sisera-sankalneey he jise -sankalneey bhi kaha jaataa he, jabaki 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 ke liye sisera prameya kaa prabalatam rup hona apekshit hota he jise -sankalneey likhte hai
 Since all forms of the Sicera theorem are linear and permanent, its sum can also be calculated
 shrenee 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 kaa sisero sankalan gyaat karne ke liye mana shrenee kaa sisera sankalan vidyaman he atah sarvapratham shrenee ke aanshik yoga ke samaantar madhya kii gananaa karte hai
 Partial Sum of Category: or in yogon kaa samaantar madhya nimnavat diya jaataa he: Since the sequence of the mean is not convergent, the range 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 is not computable
 sisera sankalan ke mukhyatah do vyapkikaran kaam main liye jate hai: praakrit sankhya n ke liye ke anukram kii vidhi sankalpanaatmak rup se in donon main se saral he
 Yoga is called Sisaira compilation and higher methods repeat the computation of the mean
 uparokt main sabhi sam padon kaa madhya 1⁄2 praapt hota he jabaki visham padon kaa madhya 0 ke baraabar hota he, atah maadhyon kaa madhya 0 or 1⁄2 ke ausat par abhisaran karata he jiskaa maan 1⁄4 praapt hota he
 Hence 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


, is computable whose value is 1⁄4
 yahan "H" auto holder ke liye pratikatv he, jinhone sarvapratham 1882 main able sankalan or sankalan main sambandh ko siddh kiya tha; 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 unka pratham udhaaharan tha
 The sum of 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 is 1⁄4, confirming the fact that it is an able additive; Its origin is given below
 sisera sankalan kaa anya sutarabaddh vyapkikaran anukram vidhi he
 It has been proved that compilation and compilation always give similar results but both have different historical backgrounds
 san 1887 main, sisera ne sankalan ko lagbhag paribhaashit kiya tha lekin unhone keval kuch udhaaharan hi diye
 In particular, he obtained the sum of 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


, 1⁄4 by some method which can be perceived as but could not explain properly at that time
 unhone 1890 main aupchaarik rup se vidhi paribhaashit kii jiske anusaar -sankalneey shrenee or -sankalneey shrenee kaa kosi gunanfal -sankalneey hota he
 According to a report in 1749, Leonard Aylor admitted that the category is divergent but its sum can be found in some way: islar ne shabd "yoga" ko liye vibhinn samayon par ek vyapkikrut karne kaa prastaav rakhaa; ise anant shrenee par islar main dekha ja saktaa he
 In the case of 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


, their views were identical which is known as Able Compilation: yahan par yah dekhne kii vibhinn vidhiyaan hai jinamein kam se kam nirpeksh maanon |x| < 1, ke liye islar ke anusaar: On expanding the Taylor range in the south-east direction and applying the mass division procedure to polynomials
 aadhunik vichaaron ke anusaar shrenee 1 − 2x + 3x2 − 4x3 + 


, x = 1 par koi falan paribhaashit nahin karti atah parinami vyanjak main vah maan sidhe hi prayukt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since the function all | x | Is defined for <1 so one can get the marginal value of x leading to 1 and this is the definition of the abel sum: islar ne shrenee par anya pravidhi prayukt kii: islar rachanaantar, unke avishkaron main se ek
 To calculate the ellipse constant, first start with a sequence of positive terms that form a series of alternates - in the present case the range is 1, 2, 3, 4, xxrep 4 
 is shrenee ke pratham avyav ko a0 se ankit kiya jaataa he
 a sequence of front intervals is then defined in 1, 2, 3, 4, 


; Which only xxwrep 4 1, xxrep 4 
 is obtained
 is anukram ke pratham pad ko Δa0 se ankit kiya jaataa he
 Eiler also relies on differential and high iterations of constant differences, but all frontal differences of xxwrep 4 1, 


 are obtained 0 only
 atah 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 ke islar rachanaantar ko nimnavat paribhaashit kiya jaataa he: In modern defined terminology, 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 is a compiler whose value is 1⁄4
 islar sankalaniyata main anya prakaar kii sankalaniyata bhi antarnihit he
 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 can be written as: jisase sarvatra-abhisari shrenee nimnavat sambandhit he: Hence the boreal sum of the range 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 would be: saichev or vaykajinaski do bhautik siddhanton: atyalp vishranti or maapak pruthakkaran kii sahaayta se parinaam 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 = 1⁄4 par pahunche
 He defined these principles as a family of elaborate "4-compilation method" in which all the categories whose sum is 1⁄4 are defined
 yah hal able sankalan kaa vyapkikaran he jise φ = exp likhakar praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Comprehensive statements can be obtained by pairing the m terms of the series and converting the expressions into Riemann-integrals
 baad vaale pad ke liye, shrenee 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 


 kaa hal siddh karne ke liye madhyamaan prameya prayukt kiya jaataa he lekin tailor prameya kii bhaanti kathin bhashaa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The triple Koshi product of the range 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 


 is obtained from the range 1 - 3 + 6 - 10 + 


 which is a series of triangle numbers; Its Abel and Euler sum is 1⁄8
 shrenee 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 


 kaa chaturth kosi gunanfal karne par shrenee 1 − 4 + 10 − 20 + 


 praapt hoti he jo chatushfalkeey sankhyaon kii ekantar shrenee he, iskaa able yoga 1⁄16 praapt hota he
 The range 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 can be generalized to other values of n in the range 1 - 2n + 3n - 4n + xxrep 4 
 dhanatmak sankhyaon n ke liye shrenee kaa able yoga nimnavat he: Where Bn is Bernoulli numbers
 n ke sam maanon ke liye The last sum was stated by Niels Heinrich Able in 1826 as the subject of special ridicule: "apsaari shreniyon purnataya shaitanon ke kaary par he or yah shame kii baat he ki is par kai upapattiyaan paane kii himmat kii jaati he
 When one can come out of this, which one wants to use and these are the ones which are indicative of unhappiness and there are many contradictions
 kya yahan par nimnlikhit ko lagu karne se adhik kuch sochaa ja saktaa he Where n is a positive number
 yahan par doston par thodaa muskaraayaa ja saktaa he
 " sisero ke guru ujin charles catalan ne bhi apsaari shreniyon kii upeksha kii
 With Catalan influence, Cicero also initially referred to "traditional formulas" as a "meaningless analogy" for the range 1 - 2n + 3n - 4n + 


 and in 1883 Cicero expressed a typical view of the time
 According to those sutras were wrong but still formally useful
 antat 1890 main sisera sur laa multiplication dez series main paribhaasha se armbh karte huye ek aadhunik drushtikon prastut kiya
 The ranges were also studied for numerator values of n; This led to the creation of Dirikhle eta function
 shrenee 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 se sambandhit shreniyan adhyayan karnaa islar kii prerana kaa bhaag ita falan kaa phalnic sameekaran tha, jo sidhe riman jita falan kii phalnic sameekaran detii he
 Eiler gained fame for obtaining values of these functions on positive even numbers, and he tried the same for positive odd numbers, which continues to be a problem currently untroubled
 vishesh rup se ita falan islar vidhi se kaam main lenaa saral he kyonki isaki dirikhle shrenee sarvatra able sankalneey he; jita falan kaa dirikhle shreniyan apsaari hone par, unka yoga bahut kathin he
 For example, in the zeta function the representation of the range 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 is interchangeable with the range 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 


, which has deep applications in modern physics but is very much for yoga
 Difficult methods will be required

 Chromosomes or chromosomes are fibrous nodules found in cells of all flora and fauna, which determine and transmit all genetic properties
 prayek prajati main gunasutron kii sankhya nishchit rahati hai
 The number of chromosomes in a human cell is 46, in pairs of 23
 iname se 22 gunasutra nar or maadaa main samaan or apane-apane jode ke samajaat hote he
 These are collectively called homologous chromosomes
 23wein jode ke gunasutra stri or purush main samaan nahin hote jinhe vishamjaat gunasutra kehete he
 In the structure of a chromosome, two substances are specifically incorporated - di en e hi anuvanshik padaarth he
 The structure of the DNA molecule consists of four organic compounds: two purines, two pyrimidines, one sugar-deoxyribose, and phosphoric acid
 purine main adinine or guanin hote he or pirimidine main thymin or cytosin 
 a molecule of DNA has two formulas, which ring around each other in a spiral form
 prayek di en e sutara main ek ke peeche ek chaaron carbonic samaakshar is kram se hote hai-thymin, cytosin, adinin or guanin, evam ve paraspar ek vishesh dhang se jude hote hai
 a unit of these four chambers and their related sugars and phosphoric acid molecule is a tetranucleotid and a DNA molecule is formed of several millennium tetranucleotids
 vibhinn praaniyon ke di en e kii vibhinnata kaa kaaran he - samaakshaaron ke anukram main antar hona
 DNA and a similar nucleic acid RNA combine with ultraviolet in the region of most 2,600 angstroms due to the presence of organic clear
 isi aadhaar par di en e kaa ek koshika sambandhi maatraatmak aagaman kiya jaataa he
 Two special types of centrosomes are found in beings
 ek to kuch deptra insecta main dimbhiy largranthi ke centrakon main paaya jaataa he
 These chromosomes are several hundred times longer and wider than ordinary chromosomes of the same species
 is kaaran inhen mahagunasutra kehete hai
 Their structure appears to be somewhat different from the simple centrosome and semisolid centers
 yahan ek gunasutra ke sthaan par ek anuprastha pankti aisi kanikaon kii hoti he jinamein abhiranjit hote kii yogyata adhik hoti hai
 All the corpuscles of many such transverse rows from one end of the chromosome to the other are identical and the corpuscles of the other rows have characteristics and differences
 in gunasutron ke adhik lambey hone ke kaaran yah samajha jaataa he ki inkaa purna rup se visarpelikaran hota he or kadachit protein kaa kuch badhaav bhi hota hai
 The reason for being wider is that a chromosome synthesizes another nucleus similar to its own
 saadhaaran avasthaa main samasutran ke samay ye donon sutara ek duusare se pruthak ho jate hai, parantu mahagunasutra main yah nahin hota
 The two sutras remain connected to each other
 mahagunasutra kii sankhya saadhaaran gunasutra kii sankhya kii aadhi hoti he, kyonki prayek sutara apane samaan duusare sutara se yugmit ho jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called somatic coupling
 jantuon main vicitra prakaar kaa ek or bhi gunasutra paaya jaataa he
 Its lampbrush is called chromosome
 ye gunasutra aise jantuon ke andon ke centrakon main paae jate hai jinamein andpit kii maatra adhik hoti he, jaise machhlee, ubhaychar, urag, pakshigan ityadi
 The chromosomes are made up of two coupled formulas similar to ordinary diplotene-diakinisis chromosomes
 donon yugmit sutara kuch sthanon par ek duusare se jude hote hai or shesh sthanon par ek duusaren se dur dur rahete hai
 These joints are considered kijma
 prayek sutara par, jisakon chromonima kehete hai, sthaan sthaan par vibhinn parisaan kii kanikas hoti hai jinako chromemrs kehete hai
 Each chromomier has a pair or more lateral clusters attached
 parshvapash bhi chromonima ke sadrush sutara kaa bana hota he, parantu iske chaaron ore rebonuclio-protein kanikas ekatrit ho jaati hai jisase ye sutara mote dikhaai dete hai
 Chromomers also breed with chromonima
 centrekaayen vishesh gunasutra par utpann hoti hai
 In most cells each chromosome has two integral clusters
 paripakv lingakoshikaon main ek kulak rah jaataa he
 Such animals and cells are said to be diploid, but some animals, especially plants, have more than two kulas of chromosomes
 yadi kisi dwiguneet praani ke cendraksutra dugune ho jaae, jisase uski koshikaaye main prayek sutara chaar chaar hon jaise, to aise praani kaa atopoliploid kehete hai
 If the chromosome of a diploid hybrid is doubled, such a creature is called an allopolyploid
 yadi ek dwiguneet praani kaa, jiskicendraksutra k1 k1 kha1 kha1 ga1 ga1 ityadi hai, kisi duusare praani se, jiske gunasutra k2 k2 kha2 kha2 ga2 ga2 ityadi hai, sankaran kiya jaae to uski santan ke gunasutra k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ga1 ga2 ityadi honge
 A1 a2 b1 b2 etc
 will be different from each other and there will not normally be coupling
 yadi is praani ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to unki koshikaaye main k1 k1 k2 k2; kha1 kha1kha2 kha2; ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2, ityadi gunasutra honge
 This will be called allopolyploid
 poliploid main chaar se adhik kulak bhi ho sakate hai
 It is clear that the autopolyploid will produce quadruplexes in the zygotein state, because each of the four chromosomes of each type is present, and the coupling of the four formulas creates one quadrupole
 koshikavibhaajan ke samay prayek dhruv ko baraabar baraabar sankhya main gunasutra nahin milenge
 Often it happens that three threads reached a pole due to the breakdown of a quadrilateral and only one thread reached its opposite pole
 koshikavibhaajan ke ant par bane hue santati koshikaon main gunasutra yaa to adhik sankhya main honge yaa kam main or aise asantulan kaa parinaam yah hota he ki koshika mar jaati he
 This is why autotetraploids are much less fertile
 autotetraploid paudhe saadhaaran dwiguneet paudhon se bahut bade hote hai tathaa unke beej bhi bahut bade hote hai, jisase urvartaa kam hone par bhi ye gruhasthi ke liye adhik laabhadaayak siddh ho sakate hai
 By providing frost, or with the effect of some alkaloids, plant autopolyploids can be made
 elotetraploid main dasha iske vipareet hoti hai
 If the two primitive parent formulas are completely different from each other, the allopolyploid is functionally diploid and will be completely fertile
 jaise, yadi kisi sankar main k1 k2, kha1 kha2, ga1 ga2 se sutara sarvatha bhinn hon to aisa sankar bandhya hoga, parantu iske gunasutron ke dugune hone se yah avasthaa badal jaaygi
 Such cells will have formulas such as A1, 1A, 2A2, B1B1B2B2, C1C1, C2C2, etc
 and the branches that contain such cells will flower, because such cells will have successful myiotic division, coupled with A1A1, B1B1, etc
 
 datura stramonium main dwiguneet avasthaa main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or ardhasuthran ke samay dwisanyojak banate hai
 Its autopolyploid has 12 quaternary chromosomes and at the time of meiosis, 12 quiescent are formed
 isi bhanti primmula sinencis se dwiguneet paudhe main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or autotetraploid main 48 sutara hote hai evam ardhasuthran ke samay isamen 9 se 11 chatu:sanyojak or 2 se 6 tak dwisanyojak banate hai
 The diploid of Solomon lycopersicon has 12 pair chromosomes and its autotetraploid has 12 quaternary chromosomes
 ye sab paudhe hai
 The creepis rubra and araepis foetida have 5 pairs of chromosomes
 inke sutara ek duusare se bahut bhinn nahin hote or inke sankaran se utpann sankar main ardhsutran ke samay 5 dwisanyojak banate hai
 Its allopolyploid consists of 20 centrioles and in meiosis there are 0 to 5 quadruple connectives and 0 to 10 divisors
 spasht he ki elotetraploid bahut urvar nahin hoga
 Primula floribanda and Primula resticillata both have nine pair of chromosomes, which are often identical
 inke sankaran se jo sankar banaata he uske prituja kivensis kehete hai
 It also has 9 pairs of chromosomes
 ardhasuthran ke samay main yugman kriya safal hoti he or 9 dwisanyojak banate hai
 The allopolyploid formed by the diploid of the formulas has 9 quaternary formulas and in such plants 12 to 18 are divalent and 0 to 3 quadruple
 spasht he ki chatu:sanyojaakon kii sankhya bahut kam he or kabhi kabhi ek bhi chatu:sanyojak nahin banataa
 Radish and Karamkalla each have 9 pairs of chromosomes, which are completely different from each other
 inke sankaran se utpann sankar refanas brasika main bhi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai; parantu ardhasuthran main ek hi dwisanyojak nahin banataa, kyonki yugman kii kriya safal nahin hoti or sabhi sutara ayugmit rah jate hai jisase 12 ek-sanyojak banate hai
 The allotetraploid resulting from its formula diploid consists of 12 pair formulas and the meiosis consists of 12 valence, quadrilateral none
 parinaam yah hota he ki refanas-brasika-elotetraploid bahut urvar hota he, yadhyapi refanas-brasika-dwiguneet bandhya hota he
 Polyploidy is rarely found in animals, but it is most often found in non-sterile animals
 paudhon main bahut si nai jatiyaan poliploid ke kaaran utpann hui hongi
 This is evidenced by the fact that about half of the species of angiosperms are such that the number of chromosomes of mature gametes is multiplied by the number of alleles of a related race
 gehun kii kai jatiyaan hai
 The basic zygote center number of these castes is 7
 gunasutron kii sankhya gehun kii jatiyon main 7 kii guneet 14,21,42 tathaa 49 tak pai jaati he
 Similarly, the number of chromosomes in different species of tobacco is 12 or 12 multiplied by 24
 paudhon main prayog dwaara bahut se poliploid banaae gaye hai, jinamein ekaatmak sutron ke do kulak hote hai
 They are fertile
 isamen andeh nahin ki koshikadravya, cendrak ke niyantran main kaaryshil hota he
 Many types of cell groups are engaged in conducting other tasks
 udhaahrant: agnyash kii exocrine koshikaaye vishesh pachak kinvaj utpann karti hai
 The cells of the renal tubule extract the urea from the blood and the liver cells converge to glucose by converting them into glycogen
 spasht he ki kisi bhi praani kii prayek koshika main uske sab jin saadhaarant: upasthit hote hai
 Therefore, at the origin of different types of proteins of different types of cells, some suitable genes must have been active and the rest have become inactive and the same thing will happen with respect to their activation

 , lakhanu, uttar pradesh Gulab Singh Lodhi was a freedom fighter of India who fought for his life to get freedom for his mother India
 lakhanu ke aminabad park main jhandaa satyagrah aandolan ke dauraan jhandaa fahraane ke dauraan angreji police ne un par goli chalaa di or ve shahid ho gayi
 Gulab Singh Lodhi was born in a farmer family in 1903 in the Lodhi family of Chandikakheda village of Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh to Shri Ram Ratan Singh Lodhi
 jhandaa satyagrah aandolan main bhaag lene unnav jile ke kai satyagrahi jatthe gayi the, parantu sipaahiyon ne unhen khaded diya or ye jatthe tirangaa jhanda fahraane main kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 Veer Gulab Singh Lodhi, one of these satyagrahi groups, somehow managed to escape the sight of the troops and entered the Aminabad park and quietly climbed a tree standing there
 krantivir gulab singh lodhi ke haath main danda jaisaa belon ko haankane vaala painaa tha
 In the same sharpener, he put the tricolor flag, which he had hidden in his clothes
 jaise hi krantivir gulab singh fahraa diya or jor-jor se naare lagane lage tirange jhande kii jai mahatma gandhi kii jai, bharat mata kii jai
 Thousands of people gathered around the park, hoisting the tricolor flag inside Aminabad park, thundered together and the park echoed with the tricolor flag jai, Mahatma Gandhi ki jai, Bharat Mata ki jai and these deafening slogans
 jhanda satyagrah aandolan ke dauraan bharat kii har gali or gaanv shahar main satyagraiyon ke jatthe aazaadee kaa alakh jagaate dhooma rahe the
 Singing the flag song, our flag is high, our victory world tri-color cute, may not know its glory, even if it is known, many people of the country had gone crazy to sacrifice their all to protect the glory of the tricolor flag
 samay kaa chakra dekhie ki krantivir gulab singh lodhi ke jhanda fahraate hi sipaahiyon kii aankh phiri or angreji sahab kaa hukum hua, goli chalaao, kai bandooken ek saath upar uthi or dhany-dhany kar fire hone lage, goliyaan krantivir satyagrahi gulab singh lodhi ko ja lagi
 As a result, he was injured and fell from the tree to the ground
 rakt ranjit vah vir dharti par aise pade the, maano vah bharat mata kii god main so gayi hon
 Thus he died on 23 August 1935, sacrificing his life at the altar of freedom
 krantivir gulab singh lodhi ke tirangaa fahraane kii is krantikari ghatana ke baad hi aminabad park ko log jhanda vaala park ke naam se pukaarane lage or vah aazaadee ke aandolan ke dauraan rashtriya netaaon kii sabhaaon kaa pramukh kendra ban gaya, jo aaj shahid gulab singh lodhi ke balidaan ke smarak ke rup main hamaare saamne he
 As if he is telling a thrilling story of the freedom movement
 krantivir gulab singh lodhi ne jis prakaar adamya saahas kaa parichay diya or angrej sipaahiyon kii aankh main dhul jhonkkar badi chaturaai tathaa doordarshita ke saath apane lakshya ko praapt kiya

 antim apadetah 28 janvari 2018 Deepavans is an ancient book in which the oldest history of Sri Lanka is described
 'dipawans', 'dweepavansh' kaa apbhransh he jiskaa arth 'dweep kaa itihaas' he
 It is believed that this book was compiled in the 3rd-4th century AD from the legend and other sources
 mahavans tathaa dipawans se hi shri lanka tathaa bharat ke pracheen itihaas ke bahut si ghatnaon lekhajokha miltaa he
 It is not only important from the point of view of history, but it is also an important ancient book of Buddhist and Pali literature
 nihsandeh ek aitihaasik mahakavy ke rup main sinhal kaa "mahavans" adhik aadrut he, kintu rachanakaal kii drushti se dipawans mahavans kii apeksha pracheenatar hi nahin pracheenatam he or upyog kii gai saamagree kii drushti se bhi kuch anshon se bhinn
 George Turner had once published his opinion that both "deepavans" and "mahavans" are two names of the same composition rather than two different compositions
 unka yah mat ayatharth hi he
 If a comparative study of the "athakatha-mahavans" of the Mahavihara of Anuradhapura and that of the Deepavans is made, it becomes clear that the author of the "deepavans" took not only enough material from the "atkathamahavas" for his edict, but the style of expression
 And at some places, the sentences are adopted as they are
 "dipawans" kaa adhikansh aisa hi he ki jisase vah ek swatantra rachana na hokar aththkatha sadrush granth yaa anya granthon ke uddharanon kaa sangrah prathit hota he
 In a way, it is just a translation of the material obtained in Sinhala into a raw pallet
 jis kaal kaa aitihaasik lekhajokha "dipawans" ne surakshit rakhaa he, vah samay mahavans ke kaal ke samanaantar hi he
 Both texts "recite" their own accounts at the time of the death of Mahasen Naresh
 is samanta kaa ek bada kaaran yah he ki donon granthon ne apni mul upadan saamagree kaa chayan ek hi sthal se kiya he or vah sthal he mahavihar kaa "aththkatha mahavans
 " mahasen naresh kii mrityu par hi "dipawans" tathaa "mahavans" ke samaapt hone kaa ek sambhav kaaran yah he ki mahavihar ke virodhiyon ne mahasen kii hi anumati praapt kar mahavihar ko vidhwans kar daalaa tha
 For the whole nine years, the Mahavihara remained void of the Mahaviharas
 dipawans ke rachanakaal ko ham i
 302 se purv nahin le ja sakate, kyonki isamen us samay tak kii ghatnaon kaa ullekh he
 The other important thing to note is that the great choreographer Buddhaghosh must have been familiar with "deepavans" or some part of it
 phir "mahavans" ko jin mahasthvir ne aage badhaayaa he unhone hamen yah jaankaree bhi di he ki dhatusen naresh ne, mahasthvir mahendra kii murti ke prati gaurav prakat karne ke liye jo mahotsav kiya tha, usamen "dipawans" kaa paath karne k ajna di thi
 By considering these things, we arrive at the same result that the Deepavans must have been composed in the early fourth century and the first half of the fifth century
 jahaan tak rachanakaal kii baat he "mahavans" kaa bhi nishchit rachanakaal agyaat hi he
 But, where "deepavans" seems to be absolutely unnoticed from the point of view of poetry, there is also a poem somewhere, "mahavans" is a great epic
 yah baat vishesh ullekhneey he ki jis prakaar srilanka ke uttarkalin pali mahakaviyon ne "mahavans" kii parampara ko chaalu rakhkar uski katha ko adhyatan bana diya, usee prakaar pandit ahungall vimalkitti mahanayake sthavir ne abhi vartmaan main hi "dipavansak kathakavy" ko aage badhaakar use bhi adhyatan bana diya he

 Hilarious travelers such as Amerigo Vespucci, Ferdinand Magellan, Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama and Francis Drake began exploring places unknown to the seafloor on the basis of geography and that is why geography gave tourism a primary form

 paryatak anek prakaar ke bhugolic maanchitron, upkarnon va pustakon kaa prayog karte hai
 a correct geographical map is the first and the main tool for any tourist

 The map contains details of tourist booklets, details of tourist centers or tourist departments of various places from which one can easily find the details of nearby tourist places and the details of guest houses, diacritical or mutilated, different types of statistics etc
 iske atirikt paryaton pustika, kisi bhi paryatak ke liye bahut mahatvapurn hoti he
 Mainly in this, historical and geographical information of the place is told with the help of pictures of the sights for the tourist
 paryaton pustika, paryatak ko ghoomane kii yojana banane main sahaayta pradaan karti he
 The local administration makes the location director indicators on important routes and places

 The compass or Qutubanuma provides direction information to the tourist
 jaagruk or sajag paryatakon ke liye diksuchak bahut aavashyak yantra mana jaataa he
 Guides also do not forget to give information about the direction to tourists while observing a place
 diksuchak mukhyatah do prakaar ke paryatakon ke liye adhik upyukt he - These types of tourists are often categorized as explorers or adventurers

 Representations of many types of statistical data are helpful in studying many aspects of tourism
 paryaton ko badhaane or viksit karne main vibhinn bhugolic tattvon kaa bahut adhik yogadan hota he
 At the same time, due to some geographical catastrophic events, the tourism industry gets such a shock that tourism at a particular place is completely exhausted for some time
 ye bhugolic ghatnaayen is prakaar hai - It is a geographical phenomenon in which hot lava, gas, ash, etc
 inside the earth come out with a terrible explosion
 is prakriya main prithvi ke garbh se niklaa lava itnaa garm hota he ki jo bhi vastu iske sampark main aa jaati he tatkaal nasht ho jaati hai
 In addition to this hot lava, the gas and ash emitted from the volcano are also highly harmful to the local environment
 jwalamukhi se nikali gas jisame anek hanikaarak gaisen hoti he jaise carbon diaksaide, sulfur diaksaide, hydrogen sulphide aadi or raakh aasmaan main chaa jate hai
 They are so dense that sometimes the rays of the sun do not reach the earth for weeks
 taduparant varsha hone ke samay ye hanikaarak gaisen or raakh prithvi sataha par aa kar vyapak rup se tabaahi machaa detii hai
 Thus, in addition to volcanic eruption, on a particular location, on a surface up to thousands of square meters, does not a human being create a favorable environment for the entire biosphere to live and grow for some time
 yadi kisi sthaan par jwalamukhi fat pade to vahaan paryatakon kii kami ho sakati he
 On the other hand, there are many dormant and living volcanoes that are tourist attractions, for example Hawaii's Volcanoes National Park

 Earthquake is the shaking of the top surface of the earth due to geological movements

 This catastrophic geographical event results in huge loss of public money
 bukamp ke kaaran bhu-skhalan bhi hota hai
 In Japan, warning plates are also placed at such places by the local government

 Sometimes there is complete silence in a tourist place due to earthquake, which also affects its economy

 The sandy beaches of Sagar are littered with tourists, but here too a devastating geographical phenomenon throws fear into the minds of local government, tourists and people associated with this industry and that is Tsunami
 ise japani main ttsunami kehete hai, yani bandargah ke nikat kii prachand sagariya lahar
 When there is a very fast movement within the sea, there is a boom in it, due to which the surge of such long and very high waves starts to move with a strong impulse
 yah atyadhik vinaashkari hota he
 It is noteworthy that the tsunami waves on 26 December 2004 killed more than two lakh people in 13 countries including India

 This factor, like the geographical factors mentioned above, is neither completely geographical nor destroys very fast, but its area of influence is not a few kilometers but thousands of kilometers

 The Halley comet is better known as a short-duration comet
 yah prayek 75 se 76 varsh ke antaraal main prithvi se najar aata he
 Heli is the only short-term comet that can be seen clearly with the naked eye from Earth and is the only comet seen with the naked eye that appears twice in human life
 nagn aankhon se dikhaai dene vaale anya dhoomaketu chamakdaar or adhik darshneey ho sakate he lekin vah hajaaron varshon main keval ek baar dikhaai dete he
 Halley returned to the inner solar system by its astronomers in 240 BC
 Observations and records have been recorded since
 is dhoomaketu ke dikhne ke spasht record chini, babylonian or madhyakaalin europea shaskaon dwaara darj kiye gaye the parantu us samay ise aavarti dhoomaketu ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa ja sakaa tha
 It was first identified by the British astronomer Edmund Halley in 1705 as a recurring comet and was later named Halley comet after him
 heley dhoomaketu bhitari soramandal main aakhri baar san 1986 main dikhaai diya tha or yah agali baar san 2061 ke madhya main dikhaai degaa
 Upon its entry in 1986, Halley became the first comet to be studied closely and in detail by a spacecraft
 isane heley kii naabhi kii sanrachana tathaa coma or poonch ke gathan ke tantra kaa sabase pehla avlokan data uplabdh karaayaa
 This observation provided the basis for long-standing concepts about the composition of comets, particularly Fred Whipple's 'dirty Snow Ball' model
 unhone heley kii sanrachana kaa sahi anumaan lagaaya tha ki yah asthir padaarthon ke mishran se bana he jaise ki - pani, carbon dioxide, ammonia or dhul
 The data provided by this mission has greatly improved our views about Heli
 udhaaharan ke liye hamen ab yah samaj main aa rahaa he ki heley kii sataha mote taur par dhul or gaiyr vashpashil padaarthon se bani he tathaa uskaa maatr chota sa hissaa hi barf yaa asthir padaarth se bana hua he
 Halley is the first comet that was recognized as a recurring comet
 dhoomaketu kii prakruti par arestu kii dharna kii tatkaaleen darshanikon main aam sahmati thi ki dhoomaketu prithvi ke vayumandal main gadabadi kaa nateeja he
 This idea of aristotle was proved wrong in 1577 by Tycho Brahe
 tiko ne lamban maapan kaa istemaal kar dikhaaya ki dhoomaketu kaa astitv chandramaa se bhi pare he
 Many people still disagreed that comets actually orbited the Sun and believed that dhumketu followed a straight path and passed through the solar system
 san 1687 main sar ijac newton ne apni ' princepia ' prakashit kii, jisamen unhone gurutv or gati ke apane niyamon ko rekhaankit kiya
 His work on comets was certainly incomplete though he suspected that the first sighting in 1680 and 1681 and the dhumketu which appeared after the Sun passed through were the same
 unki yah dharna baad main sahi paayi gai thi
 He was completely unable to reconcile the comets in his model
 aakhirkaar newton ke mitra, sampadak or prakaashak edmund heley ne san 1705 main apni 'synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets, ' main dhoomaketu kii kakshaon par brihaspati or shani ke gurutvkarshan prabhaav kii gananaa ke liye newton ke nae niyamon kaa upyog kiya
 This calculation enabled him to examine the historical records and determine orbital elements
 unhone paaya ki san 1682 main dikhaai dene vaala doosraa dhumaketu kareeb-kareeb vahin do dhumaketu he jo aaj se pehle san 1531 or san 1607 main dikhaai die the
 Thus Hailey concluded that the three Dhumketu are in fact the same, returning every 76 years
 is avadhi ko baad main sanshodhit kar prayek 75-76 varsh kar diya gaya
 Considering the gravitational effects of planets falling on comets, it was predicted after a rough estimate that Halley would return again in 1758
 heley dhoomaketu vaapasi kii bhavishyavaanee sahi sabit hui
 It was spotted on 25 December 1758 by a German farmer and amateur astronomer Johann Georg Pelsijk
 khud heley apane jeevankaal main is dhoomaketu kii vaapasi nahin dekh paae the kyonki san 1742 main unki mrityu ho gai
thi
 Confirmation of this dhumketu return showed for the first time that bodies other than planets exist as they revolve around the Sun
 yah vaapasi purv neutonian bhautikee kaa ek safal pareekshan tha or saath hi uski vyaakhyaatmak shakti kaa ek spasht pradarshan bhi tha
 This dhumketu was named in 1759 by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de lasalle in honor of Hailey
 heley kii kakshiya avadhi pichhali teen shatabdiyon se 75 or 76 varsh ke bich rahi he
 Although 240 BC Since its orbital period has varied between 74 and 79 years
 surya ke irdgird heley kii kaksha 0
967 vikendrata ke saath atyadhik andakar he
 Hailey is classified as a recurring or short-duration comet with an orbital period of 200 years or less
 iske vipareet deergh-avadhi dhoomaketu apni parikrama hajaaron varshon main puri karte he
 The average tilt from the ecliptic of the rotating comets is only 10 degrees and its average orbital period is just 6
5 years
 is prakaar heley kii kaksha kuch apraroopik he
 The shortest period comet whose orbital period is less than 20 years and tilt from ecliptic is 20-30 degree or less is called 'jupiter family comet'
 heley ke jaise wein aavarti dhoomaketu jinaki kakshiya avadhi 20 or 200 varsh ke bich he or jinke krantivrutt se jhukaav kaa vistaar 0 degree se 90 degree yaa usase adhik he ' heley- tip dhoomaketu ' kehalaate he
 Of the nearly 400 Jupiter family comets identified to date, only 54 heli-type comets can be observed
 heley -prakaar dhoomaketuon kii kakshaon ko dekhakar lagata he ki wein multah dirdh -avadhi dhoomaketu the jinaki kakshaon ko vishaal grahon ke gurutvkarshan ke dwaara prabhavit kiya gaya or saath hi aatanrik saura mandal main unhen nirdeshit kiya gaya
 If Halley was ever a long-term comet, it is likely that it originated in the Oort cloud, a massive sphere of comet bodies whose inner edge is 20,000–50,000 astronomical units away from the Sun
 iske vipareet brihaspati parivaar dhoomaketuon kii utpatti kuiper belt main maani jaati he jo barfile malbe kii ek sapaat chakti he jo surya se 30 khagoleey ekak or 50 khagoleey ekak ke bich sthit he
 In 2008 another new point for the origin of Heli-type comets was proposed the trans-neptunian object whose orbit extends from the outer part of Uranus to twice the distance to Pluto
 ho saktaa he yah soramandal ke chote nikaayon kii ek nayi aabaadi kaa ek sadsy ho jon heley-prakaar dhoomaketuon ke strot ke rup main kaary karata he

 The word train is made up of two words rail and car which means a train
 duusare shabdon main ek railgadee yaa train vaahanon kii ek judi hui shrinkhalaa he jo ek nishchit sthaayee path par chalakar maal or savaariyon ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchaati he
 This path is usually made up of two tracks, but can also be a track or maglev guideway

 Most modern trains are powered by diesel engines or electric locomotives that are powered by electric wires going over the train, but from the mid-19th century to the 20th century it was powered by steam locomotives
 urja ke anya strot jaise ghode, rassi yaa taar, gurutvkarshan, neumatic or gas terbine ke dwaara bhi railgadee chalaanaa sambhav hai

 The pituitary gland regulates hormones secreting homeostasis, including tropic hormones that stimulate other endocrine glands
 kaaryaatmak rup se yah hypothalemus se maadhyik ubhaar dwaara judaa hua hota he
 The pituitary at the bottom of the brain consists of two frontal segments: the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary
 The pituitary is functionally attached to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk, thereby secreting hypothalamic secretion factors and, in turn, stimulating the secretion of pituitary hormones
 haalanki piyushika granthi ko master ant:sravi granthi ke rup main janaa jaataa he, iske donon lalaat khand hypothalemus ke niyantran ke adheen hote hai
 The anterior pituitary synthesizes and secretes important endocrine hormones such as ACTH, TSH, PRL, GH, endorphins, FSH, and LH
 ye hormone hypothalemus ke prabhaav ke adheen agrastha piyushika se sravit hote hai
 Hypothalamic hormones are secreted through a specialized capillary system in the anterior frontal segment, also known as the hypothalamus-pituitary portal system

 The Treaty of Versailles was forced on Germany
 is kaaran adolf hitler or anya german log ise apmanjanak maanate the or is tarah se yah sandhi dwitiya vishwayuddh ke kaarnon main se ek thi
 The Paris Peace Conference drafted and signed several treaties and agreements, but in all these treaties the Treaty of Versailles with Germany is important in many respects and prominent in all treaties
 chaar maheene ke parishram ke baad sandhi kaa masavida taiyaar hua
 The treaty, written in 230 pages, was divided into 15 parts and contained 440 sections

 Germany had complained that the terms on which it had surrendered violated those principles in the proposed treaty
 unka kahana tha ki germany kii nayi sarkaar purna rup se prajatantric he or rashtrasang kii sadsyta ke liye icchhuk he
 The condition of disarmament should be applied not only to Germany but to all states
 vishwayuddh ke liye ekmaatr germany ko jimmedaar tehraana galat he
 The German proposal also stated that it is impossible to assume all the terms of the treaty
 ek bade raashtra ko kuchalakar tathaa use gulam banaakar sthaayee shanti sthapit nahin kii ja sakati
 The Allies considered the proposals of Germany and after some minor changes Germany was asked to sign the revised treaty within five days
 is baar germany ko yah avasar nahin diya gaya ki vah sandhi ke masavide ke sambandh main kisi prakaar kaa sanshodhan yaa nivedan prastut kar sake
 The Allies had made it clear that not signing would mean a re-invasion of Germany

 The formation and organization of the League of Nations was an extremely important part of the Treaty of Versailles
 sandhi ke pratham bhaag kaa sambandh isi se he
 It was originally President Wilson's creation
 uskaa khyaal tha ki rashtrasang ko shanti-sammelan kii sabase mahaan kriti honi chahie
 Lloyd George wrote that Wilson used to give the most importance to only the part of the peace treaties which had the League of Nations
 iske liye vah koi bhi tyaag karne ke liye taiyaar tha or ant main uske kathin prayaas se hi rashtrasang kaa nirmaan hua
 Barring Wilson, other representatives of the Allied view were of the view that it was not necessary to put the matters of the League under the Treaty of Versailles
 antatah wilson kii baat maan lee gayi or rashtrasang ke samvidhan ko varsay-sandhi ke antargat hi rakh diya gaya
 The first 26 sections of the Treaty of Versailles are the constitution of the League of Nations, whose purpose was to increase international cooperation and to maintain international peace and security
 alss-lauren pradesh : varsay-sandhi dwaara pradeshik parivartan karke germany kaa ang-bhang kar diya gaya
 In 1871, Germany seized the territory of elsse-laurent from France
 sabon ne ek swar se is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki yah ek galat kaam hua tha or iskaa ant aavashyak he
 Hence, the terms of the treaty were given back to the territories of alsace-lorraine to France
 rinland : france kii suraksha kii drushti se germany ke rinland main mitra rashtron kii sena 15 varshon tak rahegi tathaa rin nadi ke aas-paas ke kshetra ko sthai rup se nihshastr kar diya jaae taaki germany kisi prakaar kii kilabandi na kar sake
 Saar region: Saar region was famous for the coal field in Germany

 It was also decided that after 15 years a referendum would decide whether the people of the Saar region would stay with Germany or with France
 yadi saravasi germany ke saath milane kii ichha prakat karen to germany france ko nishchit mulya dekar khaanon ko punah kharid le

 german upnivesh sambandhi vyavastha : mitra raashtra german upniveshon ko apane-apane samrajya main milanaa chaahate the kintu wilson ne iskaa kadaa virodh kiya
 Allies introduced the patronage system due to Wilson's opposition
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki jo desh bahut pichde hue he unka samuchit kalyaan va vikaas karnaa
 The form of holy heritage in civilized nations should be given by the League of Nations for its advancement
 Mindet vyavastha ke tahat germany ko apni sabhi upnivesh chhodane pade or unhen mitra-rashtron ke sangrakshan main rakhaa gaya
 Many islands in the Pacific Ocean and colonies in the African continents were lost to Germany
 german sena kii adhiktam sankhya ek lakh kar di gai
 Compulsory military service was banned
 hawaii jahaajon ko pratibandhit kar diya gaya
 In addition, naval power was also limited
 germany kii nausena ke keval 6 yudhpot rakhane kii ijaajat di gai
 There was talk of handing the submarines to the Allies
 nihshastreekaran kii is vyavastha kaa paalan karwaane tathaa nigaraanee rakhane ke liye germany ke kharch par mitra rashtron kaa ek sainik ayog sthapit kiya gaya
 Thus, Germany was crippled in military terms
 varsay sandhi kii 231veen dhara ke tahat germany va uske sahyogi rajyon ko yuddh ke liye ek maatr jimmedaar mana gaya
 Therefore, for the compensation that the Allies had to bear in the war, Germany was asked to compensate the Allies by 1921
 mitra rashtron ko germany se kuch vastu ke aayaat-niryaat par vishesh suvidhaayen di gai
 The Nile Canal was internationalized and left open to all ships
 sandhi kii 231veen dhara ke anusaar sari kshati or yuddh ke liye germany ko uttaradaayi tehraaya gaya
 The establishment of the League of Nations under the political system was an important part of the Treaty of Warsaw
 wilson ke prabhaav ke kaaran hi rashtrasang kii dhaaraon ko varsay kii sandhi main rakhaa gaya
 The purpose of the League of Nations was to establish international cooperation and security
 vishwa itihaas main hui anek sandhiyon main varsay kii sandhi sarvaadhik varnit or vivaadit rahi he
 In fact, this treaty deeply influenced the course of world history
 in sandhi kii teevr aalochana kii jaati he or is dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej ke rup main samajha jaataa he
 Criticism of this treaty can be seen under the following points- 1
 aropit sandhi : varsay kii sandhi ko “ek laadi gai shanti” kii sangya arthath “aropit sandhi” ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Germany was not accommodated in the conference when drafting the treaty
 yah mitra rashtron kaa aadesh tha jise sweekaar karne ke atirikt germany ke samaksh koi doosraa upaay nahin tha
 They were also threatened by the German representatives, if they did not sign the treaty within five days, they would be attacked again
 atah germany ke man main yah baat baith gai ki yah aropit sandhi he jise maanane ke liye vah baadhya nahin he
 This is the reason why Germany later turned down the treaty provisions
 2
 jansadharan kii shanti nahin, rajanyikon kii shaanti : varsay kii sandhi main ullekith praavdhaan jansadharan ke hit or aakankshaon ko puraa nahin kar sake
 There were many regional arrangements that needed to be amended
 kshatipurti main kai aise praavdhaan kiye gaye the jo europe ke audyogic punerjeevan ko vinaashkari aghat pahuchaaye bina vasuul nahin kiye ja sakate the
 In this way, this treaty of peace of the public does not complete
 3
 kathor evam apmanjanak sharten : varsay kii sandhi dwaara germany ko chhin-bhinn kar diya gaya, upnivesh chin aarthik rup se pangu bana diya gaya, aarthik sansadhano par duusare rashtron kaa swaamitv sthapit kar diya gaya or sainik drushti se use aapng bana diya gaya
 The condition of compensation was very harsh and humiliating
 kshatipurti kii rakam adaa na karne kii sthiti main germany ke kshetron par kabja karne kii baat kii gai
 In fact, the conquering nation imposed harsh conditions on Germany under retaliation
 sandhi kii sharte itani kathor thi ki koi bhi swabhimani, susanskrit raashtra ise sahan nahin kar saktaa tha
 In Churchill's words, "its economic conditions were stigmatized and ill-informed to the extent that they made it manifestly meaningless
" ” 4
 The treaty was harsh in the wrong places and unfairly soft: The treaty was not only unusually harsh, but it was harsh in the wrong places and unfairly soft
 tathakthith yuddh aparaadh sambandhi praavdhaanon germany dwaara sweekrut karaane kaa praytn yatharth se pare tha kyonki jaisaa david thamsan ne kaha “is baat kaa ullekh aise masaude main shaamil karke jis par hastakshar karne ke liye german pratinidhi vivash kiye gaye naiki uttardaayitv kii bhaavana utpann nahin kar sakate the
 “the second compensation was also demanded in improbable amounts and its huge amount was fixed without any serious consideration
 aarthik drushti se yah sampada germany ke liye chukaana tathaa mitra rashtron ke liye praapt karnaa kaise sambhav hoga, iskaa vishleshan nahin kiya gaya tha
 Undoubtedly, the entire size of the punishment and compensation was inconsiderate and impractical
 uparyukt sabhi prakaar kii anaavashyak kathorataayen germany ke rashtriya asantosh va krodh ko abhivyakti karne kii uski kshamta ke viruddh koi pruthak kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 This treaty was unfairly soft, it was hardly appropriate to rule the 'essence region' by the League of Nations for 15 years and return it to Germany in 1935
 rinland par 15 varsh tak mitra rashtron kaa adhikaar bhi khokhla siddh hua
 5
 Retaliatory Treaty: The conquering nations imposed harsh terms on Germany by adopting a vengeful attitude
 france apni puraani paraajay or ampan kaa badla lenaa chaah rahaa tha us drushti se sandhi main germany ke saath adhiktam kathor praavdhaan kiye gaye
 6
 Abusive Treaty: This treaty was a cause of national humiliation for Germany
 kaisar wiliam kii apadasta, baari kshati purti raashi kii vasuuli
 Allied states' authority on German shores, Karkhono, rivers, etc
, and the presence of armies in Germany, the division of Germany, the plunder of the colonies by friendly countries and discriminatory, unequal, unjust conditions, etc
 were all derogatory
 sandhi patron par hastakshar ke liye aane vaale german pratinidhiyon ke saath klemensho kaa abhadra vyavhar, unhen kaidiyon ke saamaan rakhana, janata dwaara gaaliyaan, sade hue fal, inte,pathar ko un par phekna adi pratinidhiyon kaa apmaan nahin balki germany kaa apmaan tha
 7
 Treacherous Treaty: The Treaty of Warsaw was considered morally unfair and treacherous to Germany
 germany ne wilson ke 14 sutron ke aadhaar par yuddh kar sandhi karnaa sweekaar kiya tha lekin varsay kii sandhi main wilson ke in sutron kaa khuleam ulanghan hua tha
 The principle of nationalism was not followed with Germany
 us par bahut si sharte lad di gai thi
 But the winners are exempt from that
 wilson ke tisare sutara ke anusaar anterrashtriya vyapaar kii samast rukawate dur karne kaa praytn karnaa tha, kintu germany kii samuhik swtantraa surakshit nahin thi
 His international trade remained under the control of the Allies for years
 14 sutron main sabhi rashtron ke shastron ke kami karne kaa suzav diya gaya tha, kintu mitra rashtron ne apane shastron main kami kiye bina germany kii sainik shakti ko atyant simit kar diya
 The Allies followed Wilson's 14 sources to the same extent as he benefited
 is tarah varsay kii sandhi main germany ke saath vishwasghaat kiya gaya
 To further avenge this betrayal, Germany went to war
 8
 sandhi ke pranetaon main vaicharik sangharsh : varsay kii sandhi ne teen bado ke vichaara or uddeshyon main sangharsh kii sthiti maujuud thi
 There was opposition between Wilson's high but impractical view, between Climenso's nationalist and realist demands, and Lloyd George's opportunistic motives, despite their agreement on the Treaty of Warsaw that reflected their imperialist and exploitative mentality
 logsan ke anusaar “wilson ke adarshavaad or sammelan ke bhautikwaad main teevr virodh tha or zyaadaatar maamalon main bhautikwaad vijayi rahaa
 " 9
 sanghash ke naye daur kii shuruuaat : varsay kii sandhi ne europea rashtron ke bich vishwavyapa satta ke liye nae sangharsh kii shuruuaat kii
 Until 1919, international law believed in the distinction between the property of a country's government and its citizens
 kintu varsay kii sandhi ke anusaar yuddhrat desh apane tathaa apane mitra rashtron kii seemaa main kisi shatru desh ke vyakti kii kisi prakaar kii sampati jabt kar saktaa tha
 If he was victorious in the war, he could force the government of the defeated country to compensate for its citizens' confiscated property
 yah ek nayaa drushtaant tha
 10
 Hatred towards the Weimar Republic: After the war, the Weimar Republic was established in Germany and was seen to be associated with the Treaty of Warsaw
 tamaam udaaravaadi visheshtaon ke bich ise shatru paksh dwaara sthapit sanstha mana gaya
 Therefore, in Germany, democracy became a system of dualism, hateful and hostile
 11
 aatmanirnay ke siddhant kii avhelnaa : italy kii simaaen rashtrawaad ke siddhant par nirdhaarit nahin kii gai, na hi poland kii bhoomi par sabhi naagarik nirvivaadit rup se pole the
 Similarly, parts of the Turkish Empire were not promised sovereignty
 rashtrasang vishaal va laghu rajyon ke samaan raajnneetik samprabhutaa dilaane main asamarth rahaa
 Regarding the moral aspect and tactical compatibility of this treaty, AJP Taylor states that "from the beginning the Treaty of Warsaw lacked moral recognition
" germany ke vishay main aatm nirnay ke siddhant kii avhelnaa kii gai
 Many nations of Europe were reorganized according to President Wilson's principle of self-determination
 isse anusaar ek hi raashtra jati, ek hi bhashaa evam saanskrithik parampara vaale logon ko milakar unka pruthak tantra banane kaa nishchay kiya gaya
 On this basis, independent states of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia were born
 kintu is siddhant kaa germany, austria or hungary ke sambandh main paalan nahin kiya gaya
 Thousands of German citizens were separated from the German Empire and subjugated to other states
 ” 1918 i
 main jab austria ke germanon ne german-austria ganatantr kii sthapana kii or german ke ganatantr ke saath sammilit hone va land ko milaane kii ichha vyakt kii tab mitra rajyon dwaara sitambar 1919 i
 main donon rajyon ke sammilan par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 Thus the German citizens were disappointed by not implementing the principle accepted by the Allies about Germany
 butlerane anusaar “aatmanirnay ke siddhant kaa yuktiyukt prayog na karnaa paris kii vyavastha main antarnihit kamajori kaa dyotak tha
 " vishwa itihaas ke jin ek sandhiyon or uske prabhaavon kii sarvaadhik charchaa hui he, unamem varsay kii sandhi kaa vishisht sthaan he
 Critics have defined it as the cause of World War II in terms of the harsh provisions of that treaty and its form
 unke anusaar varsay kii sandhi shanti kii vyavastha na hokar asantosh kii janak thi
 Just after 20 years, 2 months and 4 days after the treaty, this world was hit by the Second World War
