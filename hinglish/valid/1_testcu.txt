 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is facing criticism over the recent Supreme Court order on Rafale
 raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne nai dilli sthit bijepi headquarter main press conference bulaakar is maamle par apni raay rakhi he
 Nirmala Sitharaman targeted the Congress, saying, 'we all know very well that Congress President Rahul Gandhi must not have even read a paragraph of a Judgment
 lekin, rahul kaa yah kahana ki court ne yachika sweekaar kar lee he or court ne bhi kaha he ki chaukeedaar chor he, yah nyaayalay kii avmaananaa kii shrenee main aata he
 Referring to Rahul Gandhi, Nirmala Sitharaman said that the person who is on Bell himself and breaks every principle of political dignity is making such allegations about which the court has not said anything
 nirmala sitaraman ne kaha, 'disambar 2018 main supreme court ne apane faisle main rafel deal kii prakriya main gadabadi se inkaar kiya tha
 The court then dismissed the petitions challenging the deal
 supreme court ke is order main rafel vimaanon kii keemat, unke kharide jane kii prakriya kaa bhi zikr tha
 But after that order, some former Union ministers and lawyers filed reconsideration petitions against the decision based on some documents
 iske baad kuch galat tareeke se hasil kiye dastavej jinhen aanshik taur par kuch akhbaar or magazine main prakashit kiya gaya
 Based on these documents, the petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, which is now considered by the Supreme Court as evidence
 supreme court ise sakshya maanakar disambar 2018 main die gaye apane faisle par punarvichaar kar saktaa he
 The hearing on the review petition will be in future
 ab supreme court main sunwaayee hogi to galat tareeke se hasil kiye gaye dastavejon ko bhi sunwaayee ke dauraan dekha jayega
 This is all in the court
 lekin supreme court ke faisle par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii tippanee aapattijanak he
 After the Supreme Court's decision on the Rafale deal, he also referred to the immediate statement of Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki supreme court ne sweekaar kar liya he ki chaukeedaar ne chori karai he
 The Supreme Court has admitted that there has been some corruption in the Rafale case
 hindustan ke pradhanmantri ne airforce kaa paisa chori kar anil ambani ko diya he
 On this, i want to clarify that he has disobeyed the Supreme Court

 Manmohan Singh said, 'sanskrit is considered one of the oldest living languages in the world, but there has been such a misconception about this language that it is only associated with religious verses and rituals
 aisi dharna kautilya, charak, aryabhatta, sushrut, varahamihir, brahmagupta, bhaskaracharya or anya kaviyon, chintakon, lekhakon evam santon ke kaaryon ko najrandaaj karne or is mahaan bhashaa ke prati anyaay he
 Addressing the Fifteenth Sanskrit Conference, the Prime Minister said that Sanskrit has not only given some important poems, texts etc
 to the world but it is a treasure of knowledge in the fields of mathematics, botany, medicine, arts and humanities
 singh ne kaha, ‘agar ham is atipracheen bhashaa kii tuuti hui kadiyon ko jodne or bahuvishayak pahal ko aage badhaate hai to sanskrit main vartmaan gyaan pranali or bhartiya bhashaaon ko samrudh banane kii adbhut kshamta he
 Describing the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam as the product of Sanskrit, the Prime Minister said that Sanskrit is not the language of any one caste, religion or community, like the Indian 5

 Singh said that with the aim of popularizing Sanskrit language, flexible and informal courses have been offered
 paaramparik paathshaalaon ke madhyam se vyavsaayik shiksha course ke rup main sanskrit padhaayi ja rahi he taaki ise rojgaar se joda ja sake
 He said that the work of preserving and developing oral Vedic education is also being done
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘sanskrit bhashaa ke adhyayan ko protsaahit karne ke liye kai upaae kiye gaye hai
 Financial support is being provided to modern schools teaching Sanskrit language
 is disha main swayamsevi sansthaaon kii bhi protsaahit kiya ja rahaa he
 Singh said that Sanskrit departments in universities are being funded under various schemes of University Grants Commission
 sanskrit bhashaa main samachar patr evam patrika prakashit karne waalon ko bhi aarthik madad di ja rahi he
 Underlining the dependence on Sanskrit for the dictionary of modern Indian languages, the Prime Minister said that better translation mechanisms and computer software related to Sanskrit need to be developed

 The Goa sessions court rejected Tejpal's application
 shanivaar raat kareeb 8:15 baje faisla aayaa or raat main 9:20 baje tejpal ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Tejpal was arrested under sections 376 (k) and section 354 (a)
 ravivaar ko hogi court main peshitarun tejpal ko ravivaar ko court main pesh kiya jayega
 Tejpal was arrested as soon as the Crime Branch office of the investigating officer Sunita Sawant reached
 tejpal kaa parivaar or vakil bhi krime branch daftar pahunche lekin tejpal se unhen milane nahin diya gaya
 Family of Tarun Tejpal who was present in the court, when the hearing in this case was completed and the decision was yet to come, then the wife, daughter and sister of Tarun Tejpal were present in the three courts
 mana ja rahaa he ki tejpal ko andeshaa tha ki unki aaj giraftaar ho sakati he isliye media ke sawaalon se bachane ke liye wo pehle hi krime branch ke daftar pahunch gaye
 At the same time, the government lawyer had demanded police custody of Tejpal
 'aise maamalon main jamaanat kii gunjaaish nahin hoti'peedita ke vakil shyaam kesavani ne faisle par tippanee dete hue kaha, 'aise sangeen aaropon ke baad koi bhi insaan hosh main to rahete hue jamaanat kii arji nahin de saktaa
 The court has given the correct verdict
 'tejpal kii car par phenki chappalsunwaayee puri hone ke baad tejpal jab court ke baahar apni car se ja rahe the, to unki car par kisi ne chappal phenk di
 There was no loss due to slippers, but for a while there was chaos
 sarkari vakil ne kiya tha jamaanat kaa virohis maamle main sarkari vakil ne daleel di ki peedita ke mutabik yah rape kii koshish thi
 The matter is very serious, so Tejpal should not be granted bail
 sarkari vakil ne kaha ki tejpal prabhaavshaalee vyakti hai or jaanch ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 They are also trying to violate the girl's character, so they should not get bail
 vakil ne yah bhi kaha ki tejpal girggit kii tarah lagaataar rang badal rahe hai
 Tejpal's lawyer told the court that his client is ready to submit his passport, land documents, FD etc
 everything
 ve goa main hi rahane ko bhi taiyaar hai, bas unhen jamaanat de di jaae
 But this could not happen
 court main jirah or daleelon kaa daur
 
 
 The counsel for Tarun Tejpal argued in the court that since his client is fully cooperating in the investigation, his custody is not necessary
 jaankaree ke mutabik, jaj ne tejpal kii vakil se gusse main kaha tha ki ve din ke 11 baje tak apni puri daleelein court ke saamne rakhen
 Before the crime branch was resumed, Tarun Tejpal again reached the Crime Branch office on Saturday morning
 tejpal ke saath vakeelon kii unki team maujuud thi
 Tejpal stayed there for about 10 minutes
 is dauraan unhone kaha ki ve jaanch main puraa sahyog karne ko taiyaar hai
 He said that i do not need to go to court

 krime branch ke baahar tarun tejpal ke rishtedaar bhi unke intraj main baithe the
 Tejpal was interrogated by Tejpal for two and a half hours, although the court may have relieved the arrest, but the Goa police left no stone unturned in their questioning
 kareeb dhai ghante tak tarun tejpal goa police ke sawaalon ke jawaab dete rahe or peedit ke aaropon ko nakaarte rahe
 There were some questions, more remains
 
 
 goa pahunchane se pehle tejpal jaanate the ki police unke upar shikanja sakegi or sawaalon kii barsaat karegi
 Tejpal's fears turned out to be correct
 police ne tejpal se dhai ghante tak kadi poochtacha kii
 The police asked Tejpal many questions related to the rape case
 police sutron ke mutabik tejpal se goa police ne poocha:aapke upar lagaae gaye rape ke aarope kya sahi hai?peedit ladki ke bayanon main aakhir kitni sachai he?peedit ladki ne aapke upar hi aarope kyon lagaae hai?aapke or peedit ladki ke bich kaise tallukaat the?aapke paas apni baton kii sachai kaa kya saboot he?tejpal par goa police ke sawaalon kii bauchhaar itane par hi nahin thami
 According to police sources, Tejpal was asked many questions related to the night of rape and CCTV footage: Why did you and the victim go together in the lift? In CCTV footage you are seen pulling the girl? Pulling the girl in the lift What was the motive of? Why was the girl nervous while getting out of the lift? Why did you run after the girl who got out of the lift? Rape accused fellow journalist Tarun Tejpal It is and Goa police tide question Dagti
 kareeb dhai ghante baad police ke sawaalon kii bauchhaar thami, to tarun tejpal krime branch se baahar nikle

 As if i was not in the team for the coach
 ’ mitali ne kaha ki powar ne unhen australia ke khilaaf match main maidan par nahin aane ke liye kaha
 Mithali further said, "after the team meeting in the evening, Ramesh called in my room and said not to come to the ground, because there will be media there
" main stabdh rah gai ki mere team ke saath hone se media ko kya dikkat he
 In our biggest match, i was asked to stay away from my team

 In response to this, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that if the evidence of the surgical strike is not provided, the Congress raises the question and when the evidence is given, it says that the video is being released for political gain
