 Psychiatry or psychiatry is a specialization in the medical field that studies psychiatrists
 manovikar vigyaan aadhunik yug kaa ek naveen vigyaan he
 In the 20th century itself, discoveries of importance have been made in various parts of this science
 19veen shatabdi tak vibhinn prakaar ke manovikar aise rog maane jate the jinka saadhaaran chikitsak se koi sambandh nahin tha
 In the state of complex psychosis, the patient was kept in mental hospitals, so that he could not do any harm to other people of the society
 in chikitsaalayon main bhi uskaa koi vishesh upachaar nahin hota tha
 The doctors did not really have clear knowledge about his treatment and how to do the medicine
 ab paristhiti badal gai he
 Psychology is not considered a blind cell, which deals with a small number of demented people, but this science is considered to be a matter of such importance that a proper knowledge of it is not only for skilled physical therapists, but also every servant and worker of society, It is also necessary to be a teacher, social reformer and political leader
 itnaa hi nahin, iske gyaan kii aavashyaktaa prayek sushikshit naagarik ko bhi he
 If a strong psychologist comes to mind and we do not know it, then we will not be able to seek the help of any expert to get rid of it
 koi bhi vyakti, jo purna swasth he or jisaki buddhi kii sabhi log prashansa karte hai, apane man kaa santulan kisi samay khokar veikshipt ho saktaa he
 Then it becomes useless for the society
 manushya ko chahie ki vah aisi paristhitiyon kaa gyaan kar le jisase vah kisi prakaar kii asaadhaaran maansik avasthaa main na aa jaay, arthath maansik rog se peedit na ho jaay
 Then it is necessary to have reverence in psychiatry even for getting mental medicine
 maanav kii vishesh aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye manovikar vigyaan kaa vikaas hua
 This is the result of a special gift of the 20th century
 is shatee main manushya kii kaaryakshmata or uski sukhsamagriyon main kalpanaateet abhivruddhi hui he
 His logical power and scientific miracles have increased immensely
 iske saath saath uski maansik kriyaayein bhi pehle se kai guni bad gai he
 It is not Corey that talent and madness complement each other
 buddhivikas ke saath saath veikshiptata kaa bhi vikaas hota he
 Science increases pleasant materials, and also creates sad conditions
 vah bahya paristhitiyon ke suljhaav paidaa karne ke saath saath nai maansik ulajhanein bhi utpann kar detaa he
 On the one hand, science increases the security of human beings, on the other hand it also creates unintentional concerns
 atev yah kahana atishyokti nahin hogi ki 20veen shatabdi veikshiptata kii shatabdi he
 If it has increased insanity, then it is also the task to find special measures to mitigate it
 jo desh jitna hi sabhyataa main pragatisheel he, usamen veikshiptatanivarak chikitsak or chikitsaalay bhi utane adhik hai
 Therefore, many types of psychological discoveries are being made in various fields of anthropology for the prevention of psychosis
 doctor frid ke purv maansik rogon kii chikitsa ke liye doctor log bhautik oshadhiyon kaa hi upyog praaia: karte the
 Some people used mechanism to calm these diseases
 tantropchaar kaa aadhaar vishwaas or nirdesh rahata he
 Even today this method is mostly used in rural illiterate people
 belgium ke prasiddh monsopchaarak da mesumar ne sammohan or nirdesh kaa vyapak upyog maansik rogon ke upachaar main kiya
 Manojat physical diseases were also prevented by this
 france ke bran hime or sharako naamak vidwaanon ne sanmohan kii upyogita monsopchaar main bataai
 The patient used to relieve the mental feeling suppressed in his condition and in this type of catharsis, he also got rid of the disease
 france ke nenson ke doctor imil kuye ne maansik rogon ke upachaar main nirdesh kaa upyog kiya, parantu in sabhi vidhiyon se manovikar vigyaan kii vishesh unnati nahin hui
 For this, serious experimental study of the mind was necessary
 yah kaam doctor frid ne kiya
 Now it is believed that no person can be freed from his dementia without knowing the variations of the mind and knowing the processes going on in them
 doctor frid ke anusaar man ke teen str hai : chetan, avchetan or achetan
 The mind also performs three types of tasks: the creation of desires, their control and their satisfaction
 pehla kaam bhogashrith man kaa he, doosraa kaam naitik man kaa he or teesraa kaam ahankaar kaa he
 Desires are often born on a subconscious level, they are controlled on the subconscious and their satisfaction is on the conscious level
 manushya ke bhogecchhuk man or naitik man main praaia: sangharsh chalata rahata he
 When this struggle goes on in the human consciousness, then no matter what the cause is, it does not cause disease, but when a strong desire is suppressed by a strong will, through the moral mind, then the level of the mental consciousness But instead of being in the unconscious mind of man
 is sangharsh kaa hona hi maansik rog he or vyakti ko is sangharsh se mukt karnaa uski maansik chikitsa he, jo manovikar vigyaan kaa dhyey he
 For this, the patient is brought into a state of mental dysfunction and then he is instructed to remember his unpleasant or immoral experiences
 iske liye kuch log ab bhi sanmohan vidhi kaa upyog karte hai, parantu frid rogi kaa manovishleshan karte the
 In this method, by bringing the patient to a calm and relaxed state, all the thoughts and pictures that come to mind are asked to speak
 is prakaar kabhi kabhi rogi bahut puraane apriy anubhavon ko kah daalata he
 When those experiences become fully alive and the patient feels ashamed, guilt, joy and sadness in the same way as he did the first time, then his feelings are cathartic and many symptoms of the disease cease
 rogi kaa laabh kori bauddhik smriti se nahin hota, varan puraane anubhavon kii sajiv smriti, arthath bhavpurn smriti, se hota he
 When a repressed emotion is created, it is first charged to the mental doctor
 bhav ke baahar aane ke liye rogi kaa chikitsak ke prati sneh kaa rukh hona nitant aavashyak he
 Unless there is unity of heart between the patient and the physician, repressed desire does not come to the level of subconsciousness
 phir yah sneh din prati din badhata jaataa he
 As the patient's trust in the doctor increases, his disease decreases
 apane rog se mukt hote samay rogi chikitsak ko bahut pyaar karne lagata he
 The growth of this love and cure are two aspects of the same fact
 ab chikitsak kaa karttavya hota he ki vah rogi ke prem ke aaveg ko uske uchit paatr par mode de, athwa uskaa upyog kisi rachanaatmak kaary main karaae
 The doctor keeps trying to get the patient to get emotional composition
 vah use apane aapkaa gyaan badhaane ke liye protsaahit karata he
 The patient can be considered as disease free only if he has not only been free from all the symptoms of the disease, but has received emotional self-reliance and self-suggestion
 manovikar vigyaan isi manodasha kii prapti kaa saadhan he
 In addition to psychology, new discoveries of mental therapeutics have also taken place in other directions
 inamen se do pradhan hai : Due to the struggle going on in the mind of a mental patient, he becomes a victim of insomnia
 ab yadi aise vyakti ko kisi prakaar neend laai jaay, tab sambhav he ki uskaa rog halakaa ho jaay
 The mental patient always has to fight at two places, one inner and the other outer
 use bahari or bhitari chintaayen sataati rahati hai
 Due to this he experiences an extraordinary interruption
 isse vah apni neend kho detaa he
 Loss of sleep increases his tiredness even more and then he goes into a state of insanity
 yadi use neend aane lage, to uski maansik shakti bahut kuch sanchit ho jaay or vah apni bahari samasyaon ko hal karne main samarth ho jaay
 After this, the fierceness of his internal problems also reduces
 atev jo bhi oshadhi rogi ko neend laa de, vah use laabhprad hoti he
 For this, the Indian Ayurvedic medicine is serpagandha, or the sleeping cup made of allopathic method
 jatil maansik rogon se peedit vyakti ko kabhi kabhi achetan avasthaa main laayaa jaataa he
 For this, he is given an injection of insulin
 iske dene ke baad rogi idhar udhar chatpataata he or shaareerik anthan vyakt karata he
 On repeated injections, the patient has a tendency to rupture, beat and calm
 uskaa man shithilikaran kii avasthaa main aa jaataa he
 Then the patient naturally recovers
 isi prakaar kaa upachaar bijli ke jhatkon se bhi hota he
 By this, the patient is brought into a semi-conscious or unconscious state
 uski cheshtaayen pratik rup se damit bhaavon kaa rechan karti hai
 In the treatment of complex patients, often electric shocks are employed
 jab inkaa prayog pehle pahal hua tha, tab is upachaar vidhi se badi aashaa hui thi, par ye sabhi aashaaen puri nahin huin
 Some mental diseases are also treated in a natural way
 rogi apane jatil kaamon ko chhod jab prakruti main bhavalin hone lagata he, tab use maansik samya swat: praapt ho jaataa he
 In our current civilization, opportunities for social tension have increased enormously
 jab manushya apni saadhaaran dincharya ko chhod apane man ko aaraam dene lag jaataa he, tab use swasthyalabh ho jaataa he
 According to Dr
 Yung's disease, the person comes to show the need for rest
 vah use apni ichchhaaon ko vash main laane kaa sabak sikhaata he
 According to Edward Carpenter, our present civilization is mental illness
 yah hamen prakritik jivan se dur hataati he
 It increases our desires so much that we always drown ourselves in fulfillment of them
 jis vidhi se in vyarth kii ichchhaaon main kami ho, vahi maansik swasthya kii sarvottam oshadhi he
 Therefore, natural life is the best way to cure psyche
 manovikar vigyaan main na keval prakritik jivan kaa sthaan he, varan dharm kaa bhi he
 Many mental disorders arise from the increase of craving and the lack of restraint
 dharm trishna kii vruddhi ko roktaa or sanyam ko badhaata he
 Therefore, he does not allow many types of psychosis to arise
 duusare, dharm kaa sambandh sahitya or kala se anivaary rup se rahata he
 Through them, the desires of the lower class of human beings are melancholy
 iske kaaran manushya kii in ichchhaaon or naitik buddhi main sangharsh nahin hota or maansik grathiyon ke banane kaa avasar hi nahin aata
 Psychological science thus shifts our vision to those old ways of life and values prevalent in human society, due to which the human suffering has to suffer many kinds of mental afflictions
 is gyaan ke sahare saamaajik mulyon or samskruti kaa jo nirmaan hoga, vah manushya ke jivan ko sthaayee swasthya pradaan karegaa
 With this hope, this science is expanding not only by mental practitioners, but by all social welfare-thinkers
 bharat main manorog vigyaan abhi tak alp viksit avasthaa main he
 The common man's information about psychiatrists is full of misconceptions
 aaj ke vaigyanik yug main bhi bhoot-pret, upree saaya, devi-devtaa, mausam, nakshatra, bhagya, bure karmon kaa fal aadi ko in rogon kaa kaaran mana jaataa he
 Hence, the exorcists, priests, clerics, monks, fake vaidyas, neem-hakims, untrained sex-experts, etc
 are acting as unscientific psychiatrists
 saamaanya chikitsak evam chikitsa-visheshgy manorogon ko sahi samay par pahchaanane tathaa rogiyon ko manorog chikitsak ke paas bhejne main praaia: asamarth hai
 There are several reasons for this; The main ones are: money greed, insufficient information, inadequate training, lack of psychiatrists, poverty, non-acceptance of psychosis by the patient or his relatives, etc
 samachar-patr tathaa anya prachaar-prasar madhyam bhi logon ko manorogon ke bare main sahi jaankaree dene main asafal rahe hai
 As a result, the misconceptions of fear and ignorance about these diseases have not gone away in people
 bharat kii 100 karod se adhik aabaadi par maatr lagbhag 4000 manorog chikitsak hai
 This number is very low
 bharat main 42 manorog ke aspataal hai jinamein lagbhag bees hajaar bistar hai

 The legal system elaborates on a range of rights and responsibilities
 vidhi shabd apane aap main hi vidhaataa se judaa hua shabd lagata he
 In the spiritual world, 'law of law' refers to 'law made by the Creator'
 jivan evam mrityu vidhaataa ke dwaara banaaya hua kanoon he yaa vidhi kaa hi vidhaan kah sakate he

 But this role also has moral, religious and other social codes
 darasal, kanoon in samhitaon se kai myanon main alag he
 The first thing is that the law is made by the government but in society it is applied equally to all
 duusare, ‘rajya kii ichha’ kaa rup le kar vah anya sabhi saamaajik niyamon or maanakon par praathamikta praapt kar letaa he
 Thirdly, law is compulsory ie citizens do not have freedom to choose to obey it

 Liberal theory holds that without law it would be impossible to restrain personal conduct and the rights of one would not be saved from abuses at the hands of the other
 is prakaar jon lock kii bhashaa main kanoon kaa matlab he jivan, swatantraaa or sampatti kii raksha ke liye kanoon
 Liberalism theory makes it clear what should be the methods of making and enforcing the law
 udaahranarth, kanoon nirvaachit vidhikrttaaon dwaara aapasi vichaar-vimarsh ke dwaara kiya janaa chahie
 Secondly, no law can be enforced from the previous date, because in that case it will punish the citizens for the works which were done according to the then law
 isi tarah udaarataavaadi kanoon krur or amanviya kism kii sazaayen dene ke viruddh hota he
 An impartial judiciary, independent of political influences, is set up so that it can be decided by the parties on the basis of systematic interpretation of the law

 Feminists have also criticized the concept of the rule of law that it is not based on gender fairness
 isiilie nyaaypalika or kanoon ke peshey par purushon kaa kabza rahata he
 Advocates of multiculturalism argue that the law represents the values and attitudes of dominant cultural groups
 parinamswaroop alpsankhyak or hashiyagrast samoohon ke mulya or sarokaar nazarandaaz kiye jate rahete hai
 Philosophers have been beaming from the beginning on the question of the difference between law and morality
 kanoon kaa aadhaar naitik pranali main maanane waalon kaa vishwaas ‘prakritik kanoon’ ke siddhant main he
 Plato and after him Aristotle believed that there is a close relationship between law and morality
 ek nyaaypurna samaaj vahi ho saktaa he jisamen kanoon naitik niyamon par aadhaarit pragna kii pushti karte hon
 Medieval Christian thinker Thomas Aquina also believed that in order to live a good life on this earth, there should be laws according to natural law i
e
 God-given morals
 unnisvin sadi main buddhivaad or vaigyanik drushtikon kii pratishtha badhane ke kaaran prakritik kanoon kaa siddhant nishprabhavi hota chalaa gaya
 There were attempts to free the law from moral, religious and mystic beliefs
 jon austin ne ‘vidhik pratyakshthawaad’ kii sthapana kii jiskaa daawa tha ki kanoon kaa sarokaar kisi ucchtar naitik yaa dharmik usul se na ho kar kisi samprabhu vyakti yaa sanstha se hota he

 Hart defines the law in the context of human society by removing it from the purview of moral rules
 unke mutabik kanoon pratham or dwitiyak niyamon kaa sanyog he
 Calling the first class rules as 'the essence of law', Hart says that they are related to the regulation of social behavior
 jaise, faujadaari kanoon
 Second-class rules instruct government institutions on how to make laws, how to implement them, how to make decisions on the basis of it and how to establish its legitimacy on these grounds
 heart dwaara pratipaadit vidhik pratyakshthawaad ke siddhant kii aalochana raajnneetik darshanik ronold dwarkin ne kii he
 According to him, the law is not merely a code of rules, nor do modern law systems provide a uniform way to establish the law's validity
 kanoon or naitikta ke bich sambandh kii bahes naziyon ke atyaacharon ko dandit karne vaale neuramberg mukademe main bhi uthi thi
 The question was whether those acts which were done in accordance with national law could be held a crime? To answer this, the concept of natural law was resorted to, but expressed in the language of human rights
 darasal kanoon or naitikta ke rishte kaa prashn behad jatil he or garbhpaat, veshyavriti, pornographi, tivi or filmon main dikhaai jane vaali hinsa, apni kokh kiraye par dene vaali maataaon or genetic ejineering jaise masalon ke sadanrbh main baar-baar uthati rahati he

 According to the authors of the triangle, Christopher Columbus was the first to present some amazing documents about the triangle, which he and his crew saw, "the amazing lights dancing on the horizon", and another location in their log book But he wrote, there were flames in the sky and at another place in his log book he also wrote about the absurd direction of the compass in the area

 The first article published in newspapers that mentioned the legends of the triangle was Jones on September 16, 1950, via The Associated Press

 "this was the first article to link supernatural events to Flight 19, but in February 1954, another author, Vincent Gaddis, linked Flight 19 to the mysterious disappearance of events in Argosi magazine, and gave it a new interesting name" The Deadly Bermuda Trengle
 " , Based on this article, he wrote a comprehensive book Invisible Horizons the following year

 The trend has been challenged by Lawrence David Kusche, a research library president at Arizona State University and author of Bermuda Trungle Mystery: Salvaged

 He cited cases in which appropriate information was not reported, such as the disappearance of sailor Donald Crowhurst on a world voyage, despite clear evidence of which Berlitz has presented as a mystery

 Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the events that exacerbated the mysterious influence of the triangle were events that actually took place outside it
 uskaa shodh ascharyajanak tareeke se saral tha: usne us avadhi ke samachar patron main mausam kii khabaron jaisi chijen dekhi jinka in kahanio main kabhi bhi ullekh nahin tha
 Kusche reached a conclusion
 kusche ne nishkarsh diya ki : Marine insurance company Lloyd's of London determined that the triangle was no more dangerous than any other area of the sea and did not charge an unusual charge rate for passing through the region

 Science does not have to answer the questions related to the triangle because those questions are not valid at first sight
 tribhuj me pot or vimaan isi tarah vyavhaar karte hai jaisaa ki ve duniya me anya jagah par karte hai" Skeptical researchers, such as Ernest Teves and Barry Singer, have noted how these mysteries and paranormals are very popular and profitable

 Finally, if it is assumed that the land extends beyond the triangle, such as in Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, or Bermuda itself, there is no evidence of the disappearance of any land-based vehicle or individuals

 An explanation of the disappearance has focused on the presence of vast areas of methane hydrates on the continental plane in one interpretation

 They can be divided into two categories, the action of war and piracy is the record of enemy files for many losses, while many drowning incidents have been linked to enemy raids or submarines during world wars and various orders
 It has been written in log books, many other incidents which came under this category suspiciously, have not been proved; It is suspected that the USS Cyclops in 1918 and the loss of twin boats Protus and Nerus in World War II were also associated with the submarines, but there is no link in German documents

 This park was built by Nabuchadnezzar II 600 years before Christ
 isa se 2 shatabdi purv ek bukamp me yah udyaan purna rup se nasht ho gaya tha
 Its name is derived from the Greek word cremastos, a modern English word for "hanging"
 yah ek chat jaise uthaae gaye dhaanche par lagaae jane vaale vrikshon ko sanderbhit karata he
 According to a legend, the Hanging Garden was built by the neo-babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II for his Queen Queen Amitis with a grand palace called The Marvel of Mankind, as she remembered the green hills and valleys of her homeland
 paanch pramukh lekhak hai jinke vivaran aaj maujuud hai jo hanging garden, iske samgr dizin or sinchai ke sadhano ke aakaar ke bare main charchaa karte hai, ki "yah kyon banaaya gaya tha"josephs ne marduk ke babylonian pujari berosas ke bare main bageeche kaa vivaran likhaa, jiskaa lekhan lagbhag 2 9 0 isa purv baagon kaa sabase purana ullekh he
 Diodorus Siculus has consulted the texts of both Clytarchus and Ctesias of Cnidius in the fourth century BCE
 diodoras ek syrian raja ke nirmaan ko bataata he
 According to him the garden was in the shape of a square, about four Plethora tall with each side
 bageeche ko tear kiya gaya tha, upar kii gailaree 50 haath oonchi thi
 The walls, 22 feet thick, were built of brick
 quints curious rufus shaayad diodoras ke samaan sroton par pahunchaa
 According to him the gardens were situated on top of a citadel, which was 20 stadiums in the periphery
 vah baganon ke nirmaan ko syrian raja ke liye jimmedaar tehraata he, is kaaran se ki uski rani apni mathrubhumi ko yaad kar rahi thi
 Strabo based his account on a lost account of Onesitritus, possibly from the 4th century BCE
 unke anusaar bageeche ko euphrates nadi ke baagon kii ore agrasar archimedes ke pench ke madhyam se pani se ugaaya gaya tha
 According to Philo, this construction was due to the engineering and simplicity of building vast areas of deep soil
 samakaleen babylonian sroton main dastavezikaran kii kami ke kaaran yah spasht nahin he ki hanging garden vaastavik nirmaan yaa kavy nirmaan the
 There is also no mention of Amucitis, the wife of Nebuchadnezzar, many records exist in the works of Nebuchadnezzar, yet his long and complete inscriptions do not mention any garden
 herodotus, jisane apane itihaas main babul kaa varnan kiya tha, usne bhi hanging garden kaa zikr nahin kiya haalanki, baganon ko tab bhi astitv main kaha gaya tha jab baad main lekhakon ne unke bare main varnan kiya tha, or inamen se kuch khaaton ko babul kaa daura karne vaale logon se praapt mana jaataa he
 However it may be that the gardens were not well known to the Greeks at the time of their visit
 aaj tak, hanging garden ke liye babul main koi puratathvik sakshya nahin mila he
 It is possible that evidence exists beneath the Euphrates, which cannot be safely opened at present
 nabookadanessar dwitiya ke samay nadi apni vartmaan sthiti ke purv main bahati thi, or babul ke pashchimi hisse ke bare main bahut kuch pataa nahin tha
 Rollinger suggests that Borosas attributed the garden to Nebuchadnezzar for political reasons, and he adopted mythology from elsewhere
 ek prastaav yah he ki babul ke hanging garden vastav main ashshur raja sanherib ne ninave main apane mahal ke liye banaaya tha
 Stephanie Dali believes that both sites were confused during the intervening centuries, and the elaborate garden of Sennacherib's palace was attributed to Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar II

 There is no doubt that Gonka presented Chalukya power, but the fact that he is described as the conqueror of the Konkan may mean that either he was appointed as an administrator or penetrated beyond his territory

 america footbaal gyaarah khilaadiyon kii do tiimon ke bich khelaa jane vaala ek lokapriy khel he jisamen har team kaa uddeshy he kii vah gend ko duusari team ke "and zone" main pahunchaakar ank batore
 The team that has possession of the ball tries to extend it to the opponent's endzone by running with the ball or throwing the ball among their teammates
 agar us team kaa koi khilaadi gend pakade hue gol kii lakeer ko paar karke virdohi oundzon main pahunch jaataa he, yaa oundzon ke andar khadaa hua apane saathi dwaara phenki gai gend ko safaltaapurvak pakad letaa he yaa phir maidan se gol kii lakeer ke peeche bane do khambon ke bich se gend ko laat markar pahunchaa detaa he to uski team ko ank milte hai
 The job of the opposing team is to somehow catch the ball by hitting, dropping, or catching the ball thrown in the middle, or to prevent the enemy team from moving towards their team's endzone
 america footbaal adhiktar sanyukt rajya america or canada main kheli jaati he
 The name of the institute that governs its sport at a commercial level is the "national Football League", which is called the short form NFL
 america main is khel ke do mukhya rup hai, college footbaal or vyavsaayik footbaal, jinke niyam ek-dusre se thode alag hai
 Football is also played in the higher classes of schools and the rules are also slightly different
 khel kaa maidan 100 gaz lambaa or 53
3 gaz chaudaa hota he
 There is a round streak on both sides of the length of the field, ahead of which there are ten zones of ten Gaz, i
e
 the total length of the field is 120 Gaz
 maidan main har paanch gaz ke faasale par ek yardline naam kii lakeer hoti he
 At the end of every endzone there are two pillars at a height of 10 feet from the ground, which are called "goalposts"
 kisi bhi samay har team maidan main apane 11 khilaadi rakh sakati he, lekin tiimon ko adhikaar hota he ki khel main kisi bhi antaraal ke samay apana ek yaa sabhi khilaadi badal de
 Therefore, football is a specialist sportsman
 kisi bhi team main vastav main bahut se khilaadi hote hai, jinhen teen prakaaron main baanta jaataa he: akramak khilaadi, rakshak khilaadi or vishesh khilaadi 
 Some players are kept in teams only because if a player with their own skills gets hurt, they can be put in their place
 zyaadaatar muqaabalon main kisi bhi team ke kai khilaadiyon ko maidan main utarane kaa mauqaa hi nahin miltaa
 The team that has possession of the ball is called "aggressive" and the one who does not have it is called the "defender"
 akramak team ke sabase mahatvapurn khilaadi ko quarterbaque kehete hai
 When the attacker and the defenders begin to fight, it is their job to quickly review the field and decide which player in the offensive team is in the best position to move the ball towards the guard team's endzone
 phir quarterbaque use gend fank detaa he, yaa khud hi bhagkar gend aage badhaane kii koshish karata he
 The entire time of the game is one hour, which is divided into four 15 minute squares
 duusari chauthai ke baad ek 12 minute kaa viraam hota he
 The ball stops several times while playing and then the playing clock is also stopped
 is se 15 minute kii chauthai vastav main 45 minute se bhi adhik le sakati he or puraa ek ghante kaa khel vastav main teen ghante se bhi zyaada chal saktaa he
 Broadcasters show commercials at these intervals when the game airs on television
 muqaabale kii shuruyaat main sikaa uchhaala jaataa he or ek team ko aakraamak team ghoshit kar ke unhen gend de di jaati he
 Now, on a 50 ghz streak, both teams stand face-to-face to face each other
 aakraamak team kaa quarterbaque apni team ke peeche khadaa hota he
 The atmosphere is such that two groups are getting ready for war
 khel shuru hota he jab gend aakraamak quarterbaque ke haathon main pahunchati he
 Immediately, the players of the defending team reach him and are stubbornly trying to demolish him
 kuch aakraamak khilaadi unase bhidakar unhen rokane kii koshish karte hai, jabaki baaqi akramak khilaadi virdohi ke kshetra main daakhil hokar apane aap ko gend aage badhaane ke liye acchhee sthiti main daalane kii koshish karte hai
 The quarterback has a few moments in which to decide: which partner to throw the ball or to find a way to run away
 kuch hi kshanon main uski raksha karne vaale ginati ke akramak khilaadiyon ko unase jujhane vaale rakshak khilaadi patakekar yaa dhakelkar quarterbaque tak pahunch jate hai
 If the ball is in the hands of the quarterback and is nabbed, it is called a "sac" and is considered very embarrassing for any quarterback
 adhik baar sac hone kaa matlab he kii quarterbaque jhadpon ke bich soch nahin paaya: vah kamazor he or aakraamakon kaa netritv karne ke qaabil nahin he
 Regardless of whether the quarterback throws the ball to someone, he himself grows it, usually the defenders take the offensive player with the ball at a short distance and the ball stops
 is sthiti ko down kehete hai
 The aggressors' job is to raise the ball at least 10 yards in 4 downs
 agar ve aisa nahin kar pate to rakshakon ko gend par qabza de diya jaataa he or rakshak ab aakraamak banate hai or aakraamak rakshak
 The possession of the ball also changes if the ball is missed by an offensive hand and a keeper catches the moving ball or the quarterback throws the ball to another offensive player and a keeper comes in the middle
 fambal yaa interspshan kii sthiti main jis rakshak ne gend pakad liya he vah virdohi ke oundzon kii taraf foran bhaagna shuru kar saktaa he or tab tak bhaag saktaa he jab tak use giraakar daboch na liye jaae, maidan se baahar na dhakel diya jaae, yaa vah oundzon main pahunchakar apane team ke liye ank hi na bana le
 When the ball stops, it is carefully measured at which gazza it is in the 100 Gaz field
 aglaa khel maidan ke bich main usee gaz par shuru kiya jaataa he
 This place is called the "streak of confrontation"
 jaisaa kii kaha gaya he, aakraamak team kaa yahi maqasad he ki chaar yaa us se kam dounon main gend 10 gaz aage bade
 Suppose they put the ball forward 10 yards in two downs
 to kaha jaataa he ki ve phir se pehle down par hai or unhen ab is nai scrimmege lakeer se phir se chaar dounon main gend ko 10 gaz badhanaa he
 This cycle continues until the offensive defenders reach the endzone or accidentally give the opponent possession of the ball
 qabza badalane par jo khel main rukaav hota he, usamen khilaadi bhi badal die jate hai
 Many aggressive players are adept at running and catching a thrown ball and often have light bodies
 bahut se rakshak bhimkaay hote hai or agar ve daboch len yaa patake den to zyaadaatar aakraamak-vishesh khilaadiyon ke liye uthaanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 a good aggressor is one who knows how to catch the ball thrown by the quarterback without making a mistake, and who can dodge the runaway defenders and extend the ball far into enemy territory
 kuch aakraamakon kaa kaam hota he ki ve rakshakon se bhiden taaki anya aakraamak gend aage le ja saken
