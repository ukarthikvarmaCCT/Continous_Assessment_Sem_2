 It is the national monument of independent India, formerly called Kingsway
 iskaa dizin sar edward lutiyans ne taiyaar kiya tha
 The monument is inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris
 ise san 1931 main banaaya gaya tha
 Originally known as the All India War Memorial, this memorial was built by the British rulers to commemorate the 9 xxrep 4 0 Indian soldiers who were martyred in the First World War and the Afghan Wars by joining the British Army
 united kingdom ke kuch sainikon or adhikariyon sahit 13,300 sainikon ke naam, get par utkeern hai
 This monument made of red and yellow sandstones is worth visiting
 jab india get banakar taiyaar hua tha tab iske saamne george pancham kii ek murti lagi hui thi
 Which was later installed in the Coronation Park along with other sculptures from the time of the British Raj
 ab george pancham kii murti kii jagah pratik ke rup main keval ek chhatari bhar rah gayi he
 After India's independence, India Gate has become the site of the tomb of unknown soldiers of the Indian Army
 isaki mehrab ke neeche amar jawan jyoti sthapit kar di gayi he
 In the memory of the unnamed soldiers, a soldier's cap is decorated over a rifle, with a flame always burning around the corners
 is amar jawan jyoti par prati varsh pradhan mantri va teenon senadhyaksh pushp chakra chadhaakar apni shradhanjali arpit karte hai
 The names of thousands of martyred soldiers are engraved on the walls of India Gate and the top is written in English: dilli kii kai mahatvapurn sadaken india get ke konon se nikalati hai
 There is a fair-like atmosphere here at night
 1920 ke dashak tak, puraani dilli railway stesan puure shahar kaa ekmaatr railway stesan hua karata tha
 The agra-delhi railway line then passed through the construction site of the present India Gate at Lutyen's Delhi and Kingsway, which is now named Rajpath, in Hindi
 aakhirkaar is railway line ko yamuna nadi ke paas sthaanantarit kar diya gaya
 Subsequently in 1924, when this road started, construction of the memorial site could start somewhere else
 42 meter unche india get se hokar kai mahatvapurn maarg nikalate hai
 Earlier, a lot of traffic passed through India Gate
 parantu ab ise baari vaahanon ke liye band kar diya gaya he
 In the evening when the memorial is published, a large crowd of people gather in the grasslands around India Gate and on both sides of Rajpath

229306 maury vansh kii shakti ke shithil hone par jab magadh samrajya ke anek sudurvarti pradesh maury samraaton kii adheenta se mukt hone lage, to kaling bhi swatantra ho gaya
 Three miles from Bhubaneswar in Odisha, there is a hill named Udayagiri, in whose cave an inscription is available, which is famous as 'hathigumpha Inscription'
 ise kalingraj kharvel ne utkeern karaayaa tha
 This article is in Prakrit language and has great importance for ancient Indian history
 iske anusaar kaling ke swatantra rajya ke raja pracheen 'ail vansh' ke cheti yaa chedi kshatriya the
 In the Chedi dynasty there was a majestic king named 'mahamedhavahana', who took advantage of the weakness of the Mauryas and established his independent rule in Kalinga
 mahamedhvahan kii teesri peedi main kharvel hua, jiskaa vrittant hathigumpha shilaalekh main vishad ke rup se ullikhit he
 Kharavel was a follower of Jainism and probably during his time the majority of the Kalinga people had also adopted the religion of Vardhaman Mahavira
 hathigumpha ke shilaalekh ke anusaar kharvel ke jivan ke pehle pandraa varsh vidya ke adhyayan main vyateet hue
 During this period, he received the education of religion, meaning, governance, mudradhati, law, arsenal etc
 pandraa saal kii aayu main vah yuvaraj ke pad par niyukt hua or nau varsh tak is pad par rahane ke uparant choubees varsh kii aayu main vah kaling ke rajsinghaasana par arudh hua
 On becoming king, he held the titles of 'kalingadhipati' and 'kalinga Chakravarti'
 rajbhishek ke duusare varsh usne pashchim kii ore akraman kiya or raja satkarni kii upeksha kar kanavena ke tat par sthit moosik nagar ko usne trast kiya
 Satakarni was the Satavahana king and had an independent kingdom in Andhra Pradesh
 mauryon kii adheenta se mukt hokar jo pradesh swatantra ho gaye the, andhra bhi unamem se ek tha
 In the fourth year of his reign, Kharavel once again invaded the west and subjugated the Bhojakas and the charioteers
 bhojakon kii sthiti baraar ke kshetra main thi or rathikon kii purvi khandesh va ahmednagar main
 rathik-bhojakas were probably such Kshatriya clans, like the ancient blind-women who had their own republics
 ye ganraajya sambhavtah satvahanon kii adheenta sweekrut karte the
 In the eighth year of his reign, Kharavel traveled northwards to Vijay
 uttarapath main aage badhati hui uski sena ne baraabar pahadiyon main sthit gorthgiri ke durg par akraman kiya or use jitkar ve rajgrih pahunch gai
 While Kharavel was busy in these wars, the Yavanas of Bactria were also invading India
 bharat ke pashchim chakra ko apane adheen kar ve madhya desh main pahunch gaye the
 According to the article of Hathigumpha, Yavanaraja was frightened by the news of Kharavel's victories and left the idea of invading Madhya Pradesh and proceeded towards Mathura
 anek aitihaasikon ne yah pratipaadit kiya he, ki kharvel se bhaybheet hokar madhyadesh se waapas chale jane vaale is yavanraaja kaa naam dimit tha
 In the eleventh year of his reign, Kharavel invaded the south and reached the Tamil country on his Vijayatra
 vahaan par usne pithund ko jeeta or uske raja ko bhent uphaar pradaan karne ke liye vivash kiya
 The inscription of Hathigumpha mentions the confederation of the Tamil country defeated by Kharavel
 apane shasankaal ke gyarahawein varsh main kharvel ne ek baar phir uttarapath par akraman kiya or apni sena ke ghodon or haathiyon ko gangaajal snaan karaayaa
 He forced the king of Magadha to fall at his feet and brought back the Kalinga, the idol of Mahavir Swami, Pataliputra, taken from King Nand Kalinga
 is murti ke atirikt anya bhi bahut—si lut kharvel magadh se apane rajya main le gaya or uskaa upyog usne bhubaneshwar main ek vishaal mandir ke nirmaan ke liye kiya, jiskaa ullekh brahmand puraana kii urisa main praapt ek hastlikhit prati main bhi vidyaman he
 According to many historians, the king of Magadha who was forced by Kharavel to fall on his feet was debated
 unhone hathigumpha shilaalekh main is raja ke naam ko padhane kaa praytn bhi kiya he
 But not all scholars agree with this text
 shri jaiswal ne hathigumpha shilaalekh main ullikhit magadh ke raja ke naam ko bahestimit maanakar use pushyamitra shunga kaa paryaayavachi pratipaadit kiya he or yah mana he ki kalingraj kharvel ne shungavanshi pushyamitra par akraman kar use parrast kiya tha
 But many are not willing to accept the name in the historical Hathigumpha, nor to confuse it with Pushyamitra
 par isamen sandeh nahin ki hathigumpha shilaalekh ke anusaar kharvel ne uttarapath par akraman karte hue magadh kii bhi vijay kii thi or vahaan ke raja ko apane sammukh jhukne ke liye vivash kiya tha
 This story of Digvijay and the flourishing of Kharavel's power is undoubtedly of great importance

 maharishi vaalmik pracheen bhartiya maharishi hai
 He is famous as Adikavi
 unhone sanskrit main ramayana kii rachana kii
 The Ramayana composed by him is called Valmiki Ramayana
 ramayana ek mahakavy he jo ki shriram ke jivan ke madhyam se hamen jivan ke satya se, kartavya se, parichit karwaata he
 The word Adikavi is formed from the combination of 'adi' and 'kavi'
 'aadi' kaa arth hota he 'pratham' or 'kavi' kaa arth hota he 'kavy kaa rachayita'
 Valmiki Rishi composed the first Sanskrit epic which is famous as Ramayana
 pratham sanskrit mahakavy kii rachana karne ke kaaran valmiki adikavi kahalaaye
 Valmiki was an early poet but his specialty was that he was not a Brahmin, but a boatman
 
 After writing the epic of Valmiki Ramayana, he was called Adikavi but he was a learned boatman, he was not a Brahmin, once Maharishi Valmik was looking at a pair of crouch birds
 vah joda premalap main leen tha, tabhi unhone dekha ki ek baheliye ne kaamrat kronch pakshi ke jode main se nar pakshi kaa vadh kar diya or maadaa pakshi vilaap karne lagi
 Hearing this lament of her, the compassion of Maharishi arose and this verse itself burst out of his mouth in a moved state
 are baheliye, tuune kammohit maithunarat kronch pakshi ko maaraa he
 You will never get prestige) gyaan prapti ke baad unhone prasiddh mahakavy "ramayana" kii rachana kii or "adikavi valmiki" ke naam se amar ho gayi
 In his epic "ramayana" he has described the positions of the sun, moon and other constellations at the time of the occurrence of many events
 isse gyaat hota he ki ve jyotish vidya evam khagol vidya ke bhi prakand pandit the
 During the period of his exile, "ram" also visited the ashram of Valmik Rishi
 dekhat ban sar sell suhaae
 Valmik Ashram Prabhu came tathaa jab "ram" ne apni patni sita kaa parityag kar diya tab maharishi vaalmik ji ne hi sita ko aasraa diya tha
 The above quotations prove that Valmik was a contemporary of "rama" and that the Valmik sage had full knowledge of all the events that took place in his life
 unhen "ram" kaa charitra ko itnaa mahaan samajha ki unke charitra ko aadhaar maan kar apane mahakavy "ramayana" kii rachana kii
 There is no specific evidence of the birth of Adikavi Valmiki anywhere
 satyuga, treta or dwapar teenon kaalon main valmiki kaa ullekh miltaa he wo bhi valmiki naam se hi
 According to Ramacharitra Manas, when Ram came to Valmiki ashram, he lay down like a stick on the ground to offer obeisance at the feet of Adikavi Valmiki and came out of his mouth
 " arthath aap teenon lokon ko jaanane vaale swayan prabhu ho
 This world seems like a plum in your hand
 mahabharat kaal main bhi valmiki kaa varnan miltaa he jab pandav kauravon se yuddh jeet jate hai to draupadi yajna rakhti he, jo safal nahin hota to krishna ke kehane par ki yajna main sabhi muniyon ke muni arthath valmiki ji ko nahin bulaayaa gaya isliye yajna sampoorn nahin ho paa rahaa to draupadi khud unke ashram jaati he or unase yajna main aane kii vinati karti he
 When Valmiki comes there, the conch itself rings and Draupadi's yagna is complete
 is ghatana ko kabir ne bhi spasht kiya he "supach rup dhar satguru ji aae

 tantra, parampara se jude hue aagam granth hai
 The meaning of the word Tantra is very wide
 tantra-parampara ek hindu evam buddha parampara to he hi, jain dharm, sikh dharm, tibet kii bone parampara, daao-parampara tathaa japan kii shinto parampara main paayi jaati he
 In the Indian tradition, any systematic text, theory, method, device, technique or methodology is also called a system
 hindu parampara main tantra mukhyatah shakt sampradaay se judaa hua he, uske baad shaiva sampradaay se, or kuch seemaa tak vaishnav parampara se bhi
 In the Shaivite tradition, the speakers of the Tantra texts are generally Shiva
 buddha dharm kaa vajrayan sampradaay apane tantra-sambandhi vichaaron, karmkandon or sahitya ke liye prasiddh he
 The literal origin of Tantra is believed to be like this - "tanoti Triati Tantra"
 jisase abhipraay he – tanana, vistaar, failaav is prakaar isse traan hona tantra he
 Tantra traditions are found in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain philosophies
 yahan par tantra sadhana se abhipraay "guhya yaa gudh saadhnaaon" se kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The Tantras are considered to be a post-vedic work that flourished around the middle of the first millennium

 tantra kaa prabhaav vishwa str par he
 Evidence of this is the scriptures of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Tibetan etc
 religions
 bharat main pracheen kaal se hi bengal, bihar or rajasthan tantra ke garh rahe hai
 This scripture is divided into three parts - agam, yamal and main tantra
 vaarahi tantra ke anusaar jisamen sristi, pralay, devataaon kii puja, sab kaaryon ke sadhana, purashcharan, shatkarm- saadhan or chaar prakaar ke dhyanyog kaa varnan ho, use aagam kehete hai
 In which the description of creation, astrology, daily work, order, sutra, varbheda and Yugadharma is called Yamal
 or jisamen sristi, lat, mantranirnay, devataaon, ke santhaan, yantranirnay, tirth, ashram, dharm, kalp, jyotish santhaan, vrath-katha, shouch or ashauch, stri-purush-lakshan, rajdharm, daan- dharm, yuvadharm, vyavhaar tathaa aadhyatmik vishyon kaa varnan ho, vah tantra kehalaata he 
 The theory of this scripture is that in Kali Yuga there is no result of Vedic mantras, chants and yagyas etc
 is yug main sab prakaar ke kaaryon kii siddhi ke liye tantrashaastra main varnit mantron or upayon aadi se hi sahaayta milti he 
 The principles of this scripture are kept very secret and a man has to be initiated first to take his teachings
 aajkal praayah maaran, ucchatan, vaseekaran aadi ke liye tathaa anek prakaar kii siddhiyon aadi ke saadhan ke liye hi tantrokt mantron or kriyaaon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he 
 This scripture is primarily of the devotees and its mantras are often meaningless and monolithic
 jaise,— hnin, clin, shrin, sthin, shun, kru aadi 
 The Panchamakara of Tantrikas - alcohol, meat, fish, mudra and maithun - and Chakrapooja are famous
 tantric sab devataaon kaa pujan karte hai par unki puja kaa vidhaan sabase bhinn or swatantra hota he 
 In Chakrapuja and many other pujas, tantric people treat alcohol, meat and fish in a great manner and worship women like Dhobin, Tallin etc
 naked
 yadhyapi atharvaveda samhita main maaran, mohan, ucchatan or vaseekaran aadi kaa varnan or vidhana he tathaapi aadhunik tantra kaa uske saath koi sambandh nahin hai 
 Some believe that modern system has been propagated in India during and after Kanishka's time
 chini yatri phahiyaan or huensang ne apane lekhon main is shaastra kaa koi ullekh nahin kiya he 
 Although it cannot be said with certainty when Tantra was propagated, there is no doubt that it is not older than 4th or 5th century AD
 hinduon kii dekhadekhi baudhon main bhi tantra kaa prachaar hua or tatsambandhi anek granth bane 
 Hindu tantrik calls them 'upatantar'
 unka prachaar tibet tathaa china main he 
 It is also written in Varahi Tantra that sages like Jaimini, Kapil, Narada, Garga, Pulastya, Bhrigu, Venus, Jupiter etc
 have also created many subsystems
 vyakaran shaastra ke anusaar 'tantra' shabd ‘tan’ dhaatu se bana he jiskaa arth he 'vistaar'
 It is interpreted in the 'kaayak Agam' of Shaiva Siddhanta, Tanyate Vyashyate Gyanam Anen, Iti Tantram tantra kii nirukti ‘tan’ or ‘trai’, in donon dhaatuon ke yoga se siddh hoti he
 This means that the system, in its overall sense, extends the knowledge as well as conducts those who conduct it
 tantra-shaastra kaa ek naam 'aagam shaastra' bhi he
 It is said about this- vachaspati mishra ne yoga bhashya kii tatvavaisharadi vyakhya main 'aagam' shabd kaa arth karte hue likhaa he ki jisase abhyuday or nickshreyas ke upaay buddhi main aate hai, vah 'aagam' kehalaata he
 Another form of the scriptures is called ‘nigam’
 nigam ke antargat veda, puraana, upanishad aadi aate hai
 It deals with knowledge, karma and worship etc
 isiilie veda-shastron ko nigam kehete hai
 In the form of remedies which put that form into practice, as the scriptures tell it, it is called 'agam'
 tantra athwa aagam main vyavhaar paksh hi mukhya he
 The system emphasizes actions and rituals
 ‘vaarahi tantra’ main is shaastra ke jo saat lakshan bataae hai, unamem vyavhaar hi mukhya he
 These seven traits are- tantra kaa saamaanya arth he 'vidhi' yaa 'upaay'
 There is no principle or method

 itihaaskaar 'nizamuddin ahamed' ne kilji ko changez khaan kaa damaad or kuleen khaan kaa vanshaj, 'barani' ne use turkon se alag evam 'fakhruddin' ne khilgiyon ko turkon kii 64 jatiyon main se ek bataaya he
 Fakhruddin's view has been supported by most scholars
 chunki bharat aane se purv hi yah jati afghanistan ke helemand nadi ke tateey kshetron ke un bhaagon main rahati thi, jise kilji ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Probably that is why this caste was called Khilji
 maamluk athwa ghulaam vansh ke antim sultan shamsuddin kumors kii hatya ke baad hi jilaluddin firoj kilji singhaasana par baitha tha, isliye itihaas main kilji vansh kii sthapana ko kilji kranti ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The Khilji revolution is not only important because it ended the Ghulam dynasty and established the new Khilji dynasty, but it is also important that the Khilji revolution resulted in the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate to the south
 jatvaad main kami ai or saath hi yah dharna bhi khatm hui ki, shashan keval vishishti varg kaa vyakti hi kar saktaa he
 Khilji belonged mainly to the proletariat
 kilji yug samrajyavad or muslim shakti ke vistaar kaa yug tha
 After this revolution the sphere of influence of the Turkish wealthy chieftains decreased
 is kranti ne prashasan main dharm va ulema ke mahatva ko bhi asweekaar kar diya
 Thus the power of the Khilji rulers depended mainly on power
 khilgiyon ne yah siddh kar diya ki, rajya bina dharm kii sahaayta se na keval jivit rakhaa ja saktaa he, balki safaltaapurvak chalaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 Jalaluddin Khilji's handling of the throne marks the end of the Mamluk dynasty and the domination of the Ottoman slave elite
 kilji vansh ko saamanyat: turkon kaa ek kabila mana jaataa he, jo uttari bharat par musalamaanon kii vijay ke baad yahan aakar bas gaya
 Jalaluddin Khilji established the Khilji dynasty
 jilaluddin kilji ne ghulaam vansh ke antim sultan kii hatya karke khilgiyon ko dilli kaa sultan banaaya
 The Khilji dynasty ruled from 1290 to 1320 AD
 dilli ke kilji sultaanon main allaudin kilji sabase prasiddh or yogya shaasha tha
 There were three rulers in total - allaudin khilji ne apane samrajya ko dakshin kii disha main badhaayaa
 His empire had failed to the south of the Kaveri River

 Along with this, new money was also introduced here, which was based on the decimal system itself

 There are seven basic units in this system and many other derived units

 It is easy to express very small and very large quantities through SI prefixes

 The definition of each SI root unit has been carefully designed to be unique and unique, and at the same time presents a solid theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made

 How definitions of certain critical units are implemented is given on the BIPM website
 An SI derived unit unique form is defined only as SI root units

 On April 7, 1795, gramme and kilogramme replaced the old terminology "gravet" and "grave"
 10 disambar, 1799 ko, metric pranali ko sthai rup se france main apanaaya gaya
 The metric system being used around the world has seen many changes today

 Many different measurement systems were in use around the world until after World War II

 Then the need was proved that all these should be metered, so that a worldwide measurement system can be created

 Based on the results of this study, the Tenth CGPM decided in 1954 to derive an international system from six basic units that could provide measurements of mechanical and electromagnetic quantities as well as temperature and optical radiation

 In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units or the International System of Units, abbreviated as SI, originally from French: Le Système international d'unités
 The seventh parent unit, the mole or the mole, was added to the 14th CGPM in 1971

 intaraashtriya ikai pranali main ikaayiyon kaa samooh he, jiske sadash hi upsargon ke samooh bhi hai
 SI units can be divided into two subgroups: - in ikaayiyon ke saath hi To create multiples of the root unit, the SI prefix can be added

 For example, kilo- = sahasra or thousand milli - = thousandth part i

 Specific gravity is often represented in SI units, or in the context of water
 kyonki ek ghan jiske naap hai 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, uski aaytan hogi 1000 cm3, jo baraabar he 1 l ke; or jab jal se bharaa jaye, to uskaa bhaar 1 kg hota he, atev pani kii spacific gravity he 1 g / cm3 or yah 0 degree celsius par jam jaayegaa
 The metric system has received worldwide support as a means of means and daily commerce
 iskaa kaaran bahut had tak yah bhi tha ki kai deshon main rudhigat pranaaliyon main kai siddhanton ko samajhane kaa samarthy nahin thi
 At the same time, by standardizing regional changes, a world-wide system, which is universally accepted, was created
 isse anterrashtriya vyapaar ko bhi badhaava mila
 From a scientific point of view, the use of decimal can also be described as very large and very small units
 dainik evam vaigyanik prayog kii kai ikaiyaan, saat mul ikaayiyon se vyutpann nahin hai
 In many cases this change is BIPM
 Is also valid by Some examples include: The European Union has given a directive that prohibits the sale of non-si marked goods from 31 December 2009 onwards
 yah sabhi utpaadon, sanlagn nirdeshon or kaagajon, packing tathaa vigyapanon par lagu hota he
 But on 11 September 2007, the EU declared that the UK was exempted from this directive and that their imperial system would still be infinitely valid, along with the metric system

 1950 main bharat main samvidhan ke parvartan ke baad, pakistan ke saansadon ne apane samvidhan ko gathit karne ke prayaas tej kar die
 Prime Minister Mohammad Ali and his government officials worked with the support of opposition parties in the country to prepare a constitution for Pakistan
 ant main, is sanyukt kaary ke kaaran, samvidhan ke pehle samoocchy ko lagu kiya gaya

 Also, it officially declared Pakistan an Islamic republic

 By constitution, Iskandar Mirza assumed the office of president, but due to his continued unconstitutional involvement in national affairs, the four elected Prime Ministers were dismissed in just two years
 janata ke dabaav ke tahat, raashtrapati iskundar mirza ne 1958 main takhtapalat ko vaid tehraaya; or is prakaar yah samvidhan lagbhag nilambit ho gaya
 Shortly afterwards General Ayub Khan deposed Iskandar Mirza and declared himself President
 or isliye is yah samvidhan keval 3 saal ke liye hi chal paaya
 On 17 February 1960, Ayub Khan appointed a commission to report on the future political structure of the country
 ayog pakistan ke purv mukhya nyaayadhish, mohammad shahabuddin kii adhyakshata main das anya sadasyon ke saath gathit kii gai thi

 The report of this Constitution Commission was presented to President Ayub on 6 May 1961 and after an investigation by the President and his Cabinet, in January 1962, the Cabinet finally approved the original text of the new Constitution
 ise raashtrapati ayub dwaara 1 march 1962 ko lagu kiya gaya tha or ant main 8 june 1962 ko yah prabhaav main aayaa

 But according to the projects of this constitution, as compared to the constitution of 1956, the President of Pakistan was given many rights, and basically a presidential system was formed
 1956 ke samvidhan kii tarah hi 1962 kaa samvidhan bhi adhik samay tak nahin rah paaya
 The second martial law in Pakistan was imposed on 26 March 1969 when President Ayub Khan abolished the constitution in 1962 and handed over power to the commander-in-chief of the army, General Aga Mohammad Yahya Khan

 1971 main purvi pakistan ke vibhaajan ke baad 1972 ko 1970 ke chunaav ke aadhaar par vidhayika banaai gai
 a committee was set up from the cross section of various political parties

 One difference within the committee was whether the country should have a parliamentary power system or a presidential system

 'ramachandra Chandrika' is the famous work of Keshavdas which is commonly called 'ramachandrika'

 An authentic version of its original text has also been published in the editing of Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra as 'keshava-granthvali, Part-2' from Hindustani Academy, Allahabad
 'ramchandra chandrika' 39 prakaashon main katha suchi sahit 1717 chhandon main puraa hua he
 According to Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra, although the well-known Ramakatha is described in this, it is a poetry of poetry, not of devotion
 keshav 'nimbark sampradaay' main dikshit hone ke naate radha krishna ke upaask the, ram ke nahin
 Although Ramachandrika is a Ramakatha epic, the narrative in it differs from the Valmiki Ramayana and the Ramcharitmanas
 haalaanki kavi ke ullekh ke anusaar is mahakavy ko rachane kii prerana unhen adikavi valmiki se hi mili
 They wrote that is ke purvardh kii katha valmikiy ramayana se kuch-kuch samya bhi rakhata he kintu uttarardh main kavi kii nijee udbhaavna evam vyavastha hi pramukh he
 The poet's erudition is demonstrated through this poetry
 samvaad-yojana, alankaar-yojana, chand-yojana kii drushti se yah kavy kavi ke acharyatv ke kaushal ko hi prastut karata he
 In this, the poet has broken the well-known narrative tradition
 vastutah unhone is granth-rachana main pratyaksh sahyog sanskrit ke 'prasanraghav', 'hanumannatak' aadi granthon se liya he
 'kadambari' also has a clear effect
 naatakon kaa aadhaar lene se or katha bhaag chhod dene se samvaad ke vaktaaon ke naam inhen padya se pruthak rakhane pade hai
 The dialogue-planning is done in a dramatic way, so it can be used with visual simplicity as a special feature
 keshav ke is kavyagranth main bhakthi kii pradhanta na hote hue bhi ram ko avtari mana gaya he tathaa anek sthalon par unase upadesh dilaayaa gaya he
 As a result, the didactic passages have become substantial and poetry has been damaged
 keshav ko reetikaal kaa yuganirmaataa sahityakar tathaa hindi kaa pratham acharya kavi mana gaya he
 From this point of view, the predominance of Acharyatva is also evident in Ramachandrika
 style kii drushti se isamen vividh prakaar ke chhandon ke udhaaharan prastut karne kii pravriti dikhaai padati he
 It seems that poets are teaching someone the method of pingle
 ramchandrika kii bhashaa sanskritpradhan brajabhasha he
 Due to excessive use of Sanskrit words and the miracle of ornamentation, the composition has become cumbersome and annoying
 is granth main kavi kii sahrudayata se kahin adhik panditya kaa pradarshan prabal he
 In the words of Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra, it undoubtedly expresses the great piety and acharya of Keshava
 pracheen hindi sahitya kaa marmajna hone ke liye ramchandra chandrika kaa adhyayan nirvivaad rup se anivaary he
 It has an important place in Hindi literature

 yah kisi bhi pranali se prakaash kiran prasaarit karti he
 In the olden times, these works were done by lighting a fire, because in the present time there are many other means of electricity
 iskaa uddeshy sagar main jahaajon ke chaalkon yaa navikon ko khatarnaak chattaanon se aagaah karnaa hota he
 These are meant to indicate the safe entry of rocky coastlines, dangerous reefs and harbors
 pehle kaaphi prayog hote rahe in prakaash deepon kaa prayog inke mahange anurakshan evam ji pi aar es takanic sahit anya unnat suvidhaon ke aane se bahut hi kam ho gaya he
 It is said that about 280 years ago, a lampstand of the confluence was built on the island of Pharos near Alexandria, which was 600 feet high
 yah vishwa ke saat aashcharyon main gina jaataa tha or itnaa prasiddh tha ki dipastambhon ke liye pashchim main faros ek saamaanya naam ho gaya tathaa dipastambh-nirmaan-vigyaan, farology kahalaane laga
 But in the 13th century it was destroyed by an earthquake
 is prakaar dipastambh kaa itihaas yadhyapi do hajaar varsh se bhi adhik pracheen he, phir bhi pranaraksha ke saath saadhan ke rup main dipastambhon kii niyamit vyavastha 19veen shatee main hi prarambh hui
 According to the circumstances and requirements of different places, the structure of lampstands is different
 bhoomi par, yaa bade tapuon par, bananevaale sthal dipastambhon kaa abhikalp praaia: ek jaisaa hi hota he
 The only difference is that according to Paras, that is, the height and the lighting equipment are kept as far as the light is required to be seen from each lamp
 kintu samudri dipastambh, jo khule samudr main padi kisi sunsaan chattan par banate hai jahaan din-raat bheeshan lehren takkar maaraa karti he, vastav main injiyiri kaushal ke vijayastambh hi hai
 The large lampstands of the United States of Alligator Reef, Great Britain's Eddystone, Belrock and Scarevore's France are extremely important in this regard
 samudri dipastambhon kii rachana ke chaar prakaar ullekhneey hai : 1
 Masonry or concrete structures are considered good for erecting rocks
 samudr ke andar peepe daalkar, yaa anyatra bhi jahaan pakki neenv rakhi ja sake, yah rachana upyukt hoti he
 In this type of composition, it takes special care that: 2
 khuli hui, ispaat yaa lohe kii dhaanchedaar rachana vahaan ke liye upyukt hoti he, jahaan kachi yaa balui jagah par sthunon yaa anya prakaar kii neenv aavashyak hoti he
 It is also suitable on hundreds of velas or coral reefs and in such places where other materials are expensive and the facility to create a composition is especially worth considering
 jameen main lohe yaa ispaat ke sthun gaad die jate yaa pench kii bhanti kas die jate hai or unke upar dhaanchaa khadaa kiya jaataa he
 3
 Cast iron iron tower is suitable where masonry pillar is very expensive due to high cost of stone and not enough labor
 4
 pipon kii neenv par khadi kii gai sanrachana saikat bela yaa retili mitti main hi safal ho sakati he
 a 140 feet high normal lamp made of granite, with a base diameter of 42 feet and a diameter of 16 feet above, has approximately 58,580 cubic feet of masonry
 prayek samudri dipaghar main praaia: chaar dipapal rahete hai, jinamein se teen dipaghar main hi rahete hai or chauthaa tat par
 Deeppal can also keep his family in Sthal Deepghars
 isliye inamen jab kuhara sanket hota he tab teen teen, anyathaa do-do hi, dipapal rahete hai
 Countries such as Great Britain, France and the United Nations, USA, have a large number of lighthouses on the Ta beach and have special government institutions for their arrangement, but the sea level in India has not yet attained the same importance
 yahan ke keval do dipastambh ullekhneey hai : ek bengal kii khadi main alaguada chattan par, jo san 1865 main bana tha or doosraa bombai ke paas, jo san 1874 main bana
 In the peak of the ancient lampstands, lighting was often done by burning coal or wooden logs on top of a mesh
 vah vyavastha bahut mahangi padati thi
 Some times 400 tons of coal were used in a year, yet the constant change of light and constant appearance of light in the atmosphere was always uncertain
 aisi prakashvyavastha praaia: 19veen shatee ke madhya tak rahi, yadhyapi 18veen shatee main tel kaa prayog bhi hone laga tha
 Coalgas was used in the 19th century
 san 1898 main francisi dipadhar seva ne uddipt khanij teljvalak lagaae
 Nowadays, these are often seen all over the world
 inamen sthaan-sthaan par maamuli bhed hota he
 The principle of incandescent mineral oil flammers is that the liquid mineral oil is injected with pressure into a vaporizer, where it is heated to vapor by a few secondary jets
 vaashp ek tonti se nikalataa he or apane saath kuch vaayu liye hue jwalak ke sheersh par bane ek prakoshth main pahunchataa he, jahaan donon milakar dahansheel gas main badal jate hai, jisase mantal uddipt hota he
 Also, a little gas also reaches the secondary jets
 ek haathpump dwaara sampeedit vaayu kii kuch maatra sthir rakhi jaati he, jisase ant:kshepan ke liye dabaav uplabdh rahe
 The use of oil gas started in the eighth decade of the last century
 tel gas bade bade pipon main, jinhen samay samay par prakashastambhon main pahunchaana padataa he, vayumandal ke nau-das gune dabaav par bhari rahati he
 The flame of acetylene itself has a lot of glow and the transportation of this gas is convenient
 isliye boyon tathaa sanketon main prakaash ke liye to yah sansar bhar main kaam aati hi he, amahatvapurn prakashastambhon ke liye or aise sthanon par bhi jahaan parichar nahin rahete, iskaa prayog hota he
 Mantilwala zalwak is also sometimes applied to enhance the brightness
 kuch uddipt jvalkon se aisi hi dipti nikalati he jaisi khanij tel-vaashp-jvalkon se
 Some lighthouse officers also use on-the-spot gas-making plants from carbide and water
 prakaash ke liye kahin-kahin bijli kaa bhi prayog kiya gaya he
 Lanterns - Except for very small pillars, almost all lighthouses have lighting devices placed inside a lantern at the top
 laalaten ke shishon ke gaj kaaphi majboot, kintu yathasambhav patale hote he, taaki prakaash nikalne main unke kaaran kam se kam avrodh ho
 The upper part of the lantern is like a dome, with a ventilator to vent the heat
 paryaapt sanvathan bahut aavashyak he
 The size of a lantern varies according to the lighting device placed in it
 chote stambhon main iskaa vyas paanch foot tak ho saktaa he, jab ki pratham shrenee ke stambhon main praaia: 14 foot or dwitiya shrenee ke stambhon main 12 foot hota he
 The glazed portion of the large lanterns is about 10 feet high
 sheesha praaia: 1 / 4 inch motaa or laalaten kii golai ke anuroop hi muda hota he
 Where there is a high fear of breakage, a 12-inch thick mirror is applied
 laalaten kii chat praaia: lohe kii, yaa taanbe kii, hoti he
 These sheets are kept in a structure with steel, gunmetal or cast iron links
 kuch prakashastambhon main yah bhi aavashyak prathit hua he ki baahar kii ore jaali yaa janglaa laga diya jaae, taaki prakaash se aakrisht hokar samudri pakshi chot se sheesha hi na tod den
 The barrels of the lantern, the handcuffs and the major metallic composition should be attached to the tadtsinvak
 taditsanvahak 1 / 4 inch moti taanbe kii chad kaa tathaa sanvatak ke ucchtam bhaag se 18 inch upar tak hona chahie
 Its lower end should go from the lowest of the water to the bottom, or it should be buried in wet soil by putting a 20 inch long, 12 inch wide and 1 / 2 inch thick crust on the end
 prakaash upkaran - 19veen shatee ke antim paad main sthirdip ke avagun vishesh rup se anubhav kiye gaye
 Their use was gradually reduced and in place of them, the need for special kind of light was deemed favorable to the situation
 bhramideep, jisamen samay-samay par prachhaadan hota rahe, adhik upyukt samajha gaya
 Sometimes there is a drum-like curtain around the flame, which can be elevated or lowered
 kabhi-kabhi ghumta hua prachhadanpat lagaaya jaataa he
 To keep the cover moving, there is a device such as a load or spring-operated clock, which carries a warning signal along with a moving regulator, which in time suggests that the key needs to be given now
 jahaan bijli uplabdh hoti he, ek choti si motor bhi laga di jaati he, jo aavashyaktaa hone par swat: chaabi de diya karti he, athwa sidhe prakaash upkaran ko hi ghumaati rahati he
 In modern instruments illuminated by gas, the pressure of gas is used to rotate the lens of the device
 yadi kisi prakaar ke gas jwalak lage hai, to kabhi kabhi unhen hi baari baari se jala bujhaakar prakaash or prachhaadan kaa prabhaav utpann kiya jaataa he
 Modern light glow is better than masking light
 bhanti bhanti ke prakaash jo aajkal kaam aate hai, nimnlikhit hai : Jyoti appears continuously in the same way in Staddeep
 iskaa prayog ab keval chote pattanon tak hi simit rah gaya he tathaa aadhunik prakashastambhon main nahin ke baraabar he
 This can cause illusions of shiplight, or adjacent coastal light
 damak jyoti anek prakaar kii hoti he
 a spark-light appears at important places
 damakane ke bich kaa antaraal damakane ke samay se sadaa adhik hota he
 In a multiple-fire-light, there is a sequence of long intervals after flaring two or more times: such as two, three, or more, half-second seconds, half-second flashes of two seconds, then dark for ten seconds The sequence of moves continuously
 sthir-damak-jyoti main sthir jyoti ke bich bich niyamit antar se ek damak aati he, jiske aage peeche thodi thodi der kaa prachhaadan rahata he
 It becomes unreliable when the light intensity is uneven
 sthir evam anek-damak-jyoti main bhi yahi dosha he
 In the masking light, there is a sequence of coverings at regular intervals with steady light
 prakaash or tam kaa samay samaan yaa asmaan ho saktaa he
 When the cover is of two, or more times, it is called multiple covert-light
 prayavarti prakaash baari baari se do rangon ke sthir prakaash ko kehete hai
 If any of the aforesaid light turns alternately into two colors, then applying the first reversal of its name makes sense
 sandarshan prakaash kisi sankare maarg main sandarshan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Bhramideep is not used for this
 sthirdip hi, praaia: prachhaadan sahit, is kaam ke liye upyukt hote hai
 In a particular waterway, or between sandy shores or other dangerous places, there is such a system of lighting to show the way that the danger should be colored with white light and white light should keep a sufficient distance from the danger and provide safe passage
 rangeen prakaash kaa prayog kahi kahin khatarnaak jagahon kii pahchaan ke liye, yaa anek prakaar ke sanketon main bhinnata laane ke liye, anivaary ho jaataa he, anyathaa rangon kaa prayog yathasambhav kam se kam kiya jaataa he
 Because it reduces the intensity of light
 pahchaan kaa kaam anek-damak-jyoti se hi chalaanaa acha he
 Light from alternating colors cannot also be recommended, because absorption of colored rays and colorless rays in the atmosphere is different
 yadi anivaary hi hota he, to rangeen kiranavali ke liye lens or prism-samooh kaa kshetra bada kar diya jaataa he, taaki aarambh main inaki tivrata rangahin kirnwali kii tivrata ke lagbhag baraabar hi rahe
 After penetrating the red color of the glass, the intensity of light remains only 40 percent and on penetrating the green color only 25 per cent
 isliye yadi rangahin prakaash ke saath saath laal or hare rang ke prakaash bhi rakhana anivaary hon, to unhen prabalit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The intensity is increased to the required level by applying mirrors or by prismal azimuthal condensation, or any other way
 paraas, arthath kitni dur se prakashastambh dikhaai de saktaa he, yah do baton par nirbhar he : ek to samudratal se oonchaai or duusare, prakaash kii tivrata
 The light of most of the important lampstands is so intense that it can be seen with full geographical range in clear weather
 paraas samudri milon main nikaala jaataa he or darshak kii sthiti samudratal se praaia: 15 foot unchi maan lee jaati he
 In certain conditions of the atmosphere, the glow of special powerful light can be seen even beyond the calculated range
 darshak aankh samudratal par ho to vibhinn unchaaiyon ke liye pariklit bhugoki paraas kii talika neeche di he
 According to the same table for the height of the eye of the beholder, by adding geographical range, the complete range can be removed
 yadi chattaanon par neenv ke liye paryaapt sthaan na ho, yaa balua tat ho or uski baaluu khisak jane kii sambhaavna ho, athwa aisi hi anya paristhitiyaan hon, jinke kaaran dipastambh khadaa karnaa asambhav ho yaa atyadhik mahanga ho, to vahaan pathpradarshan ke liye ek jahaaj rakhaa jaataa he, jo apane mastul par deep liye hue aasapaas ghumta rahata he
 This is Deepenauka
 kabhi kabhi isamen kuharaasanket or radiyon sanket bhi rahete he
 These ships are about 60 to 150 feet long and 20 to 30 feet wide with displacement ranging from 20 to 500 tons
 inamen prakaash jalatal se lagbhag 35 foot oonchaai par hota he
 a lighting device is almost the same as a lighthouse
 praaia: iske lens ek lolak main lage hote hai, taaki jahaaj ke dagamagane par bhi ve kshaitij prakaash phenk saken
 Many also have an electrophoresis, which provides electricity for light and for sound effects
 jahaan dipanaukaaon kii praarambhik laagat or unpar honevaale aavartak vyay kaa auchity nahin hota, vahaan prakashboya kaam aate hai
 In the buoy there are often no sailors, but they themselves float around the designated site
 inkaa prayog jalpath chihrit karne ke liye, khatarnaak sthaan, yaa bhagnpot aadi kii sthiti bataane ke liye hota he
 These are of various types as per local requirements
 bahuton main siti, ghanti or turahi sareekhe sanketak lage hote hai, jo yaa to samudr main boyaa kii harakat se hi chaalit hote hai, yaa phir uske andar bane bijli athwa sampeedit gas ke yantra se
 The light sown contains light from the mineral oil gas
 gas ke liye vashpikrut paraffin adhik upyukt he, kolgas thik nahin
 The gas inside the buoy is kept under heavy pressure, but the illumination power of the coal gas is destroyed by excessive pressure
 aesetilin gas ek baar bharne par lagbhag ek varsh ke liye paryaapt hoti he
 The oil-burners have difficulty in cutting off their lights
 france main carbonikrut battiyaan lagaai jaati hai, kintu inkaa samanjan bahut hi baariki se karnaa padataa he
 In England, Wigham flasks are widely planted, which have a self-sustaining system of accommodation
 vidyuttprakash ke liye tat se boyaa tak cabile le janaa padataa he, jisaki dekhbhaal mahangi or kashtsaadhay hoti he

 MP Nagendra Singh jan lokapal vidheyak ke nirmaan ke liye jari yah andolan apane akhil bhartiya swaroop main 5 april 2011 ko samajasevi anna hajaare evam unke saathiyon ke jantar-mantar par shuru kiye gaye anshan ke saath aarambh hua, jinamein magsese puraskaar vijeta arvind kejariwal, bharat kii pehali mahila prashasnic adhikari kiran bedi, prasiddh lokdharmee vakil prashanth bhushan, patanjali yogapith ke sansthaapak baba ramdev aadi shaamil the
 Due to the influence of the means of communication, the impact of this fast spread throughout India and in support of it people started taking to the streets
 inhone bharat sarkaar se ek majboot bhrashtachar virdohi lokapal vidheyak banane kii maang kii thi or apni maang ke anuroop sarkaar ko lokapal bill kaa ek masauda bhi diya tha
 But the then government led by Manmohan Singh showed negative attitude towards it and ignored it
 iske parinamswaroop shuru hue anshan ke prati bhi unka ravaiya upeksha purna hi rahaa
 But taking the form of the agitation for this fast, the Government of India hastily avoided the potential danger by forming a committee and accepted the passage of Lokpal Bill in Parliament by 16 August
 agast se shuru hue monsoon satr main sarkaar ne jo vidheyak prastut kiya vah kamjor or jan lokapal ke sarvatha vipareet tha
 Anna Hazare reiterated that he would go on hunger strike from August 16 against his earlier declared date
 sarkaar ne isaki raah main kai rode atkaaye evam 16 agast ko anna hajaare evam unke saathiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 But this led to agitation in the entire country
 desh bhar main agle 12 dilon tak lagaataar badi sankhya main dharna, pradarshan or anshan yojit kiye gaye
 Finally, on August 28, Anna announced the postponement of his fast after the Parliament passed the proposal of concurrence on three terms of Anna
 5 april 2011 ko ek shashakt lokapal vidheyak ke nirmaan kii maang par sarkari niskriyata ke pratirodh main anna hajaare ne aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 Arvind Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi, Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev and many other famous social workers were involved in this campaign against corruption
 sarkaar ne ise upekshit karnaa jari rakhaa
 This fast began to be published and circulated widely in the media of India and soon
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jari is koshish ko sheeghra hi vyapak jansamarthan milane laga
 In almost all the cities of India, the youth took to the streets and demonstrated in support of it and distributed pamphlets
 anna hajaare ke anshan ke deshvyapee jan aandolan ke rup main fail jane se chintit sarkaar ne janalokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye jhatpat ek samiti kii ghoshnaa kii
 It also agreed to pass a strong Lokpal Bill in Parliament before 16 August
 is tarah yah anshan samaapt hua or bhrashtachar ke viruddh panapata jan andolan majboot lokapal ke nirmaan kii aashaa ke saath samaapt hua
 But the government's intent was doubtful, so Anna Hazare also announced that if the expected Lokpal Bill is not produced by the next 15 August, then he will go on a fast from 16 August
 april main kiye gaye anna hajaare ke anshan kii samaapti kii sharton ke anuroop sarkaar ne 10 sadasyeey lokapal masauda nirmaan samiti ke nirmaan kii ghoshnaa kii
 5 representatives of the government and 5 representatives of civil society were placed in it
 anna hajaare ne sarkaar ke sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kii baadhyataa vaale tark kaa virodh na karte hue kisi mantri ko samiti kaa adhyaksh hona sweekaar kar liya
 But the ministers of this committee headed by Kapil Sibal did their own arbitrariness
 pradhanmantri or nyaayadhishon ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke mudde par naagarik samaaj ke pratinidhiyon or sarkaar ke bich virodh bana rahaa
 Kapil Sibal said that civil society opinion will not be taken to make law in future
 antat mantriyon ne anna hajaare dwaara prastut jan lokapal ke sabhi mahatvapurn sujhaavon ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 All the points of the Jan Lokpal were accepted for showing, which kept the government ministers and mps, and the judges out of the reach of the Lokpal
 antat sarkari mantriyon ke ravaiye se niraash anna hajaare ke saathiyon ne jan lokapal kaa masauda alag se nirmit kiya
 And thus the committee produced two drafts which were placed before the Union Cabinet
 vahaan bhi mantriyon ke masaude ko to purnatah prastut kiya gaya kintu jan lokapal kaa saransh rakhaa gaya
 And as expected, the cabinet adopted the draft ministers and agreed to present it in Parliament
 4 agast 2011 ko sansad main lokapal vidheyak prastut kiya gaya
 The Prime Minister was kept out of its purview during his tenure in the government's Lokpal Bill
 lekin sabhi bhootpurv pradhanmantri iske daayre main rakhe gaye the
 Accordingly, the Lokpal will be a committee headed by a current or retired judge
 isamen aath sadsy honge jisamen se chaar kaanoon ko jaanane vaale evam anbhavi log honge
 The time limit for investigation was kept at seven years
 bharat kaa 65 vaan swadhinata diwas samaaroh anna hajaare dwaara april ke anshan kii samaapti kii is ghoshnaa kii chaaya main hua ki yadi 15 agast tak sarkaar ne lokapal vidheyak paas nahin karaayaa to ve punah anshan karengen
 Several days before August 15, it had become clear that there would be a hunger strike announced from August 16
 sarkaar ne ise rokane kii har tarah kii koshish aarambh kar di

 Anna did not agree to a fast for at least 30 days
 der raat ko dilli ke police ayukta ne kiran bedi, prashanth bhushan, manish sitaudiya or arvind kejarivaal vaali anna team ke saath baithak kii
 After spending three days in Tihar Jail, when Anna Hazare came out at quarter past 12, he was seen full of enthusiasm
 unhone inkulab jindabad or bharat mata kii jai ke naare ke saath apane samarthakon kaa josh badhaayaa
 Anna said while addressing the supporters "1947 main adhuri aazaadee mili
 The movement for independence gained in 1947 started in 1942 and now from August 16 another freedom struggle has started, which you have to reach the end
 anna rahe yaa na rahe lekin bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yah mashaal jalati rahani chahie
 i thank all of you who have been sitting outside the jail for 4 days and appeal to the children, old and young, to reach Ramlila Maidan in maximum numbers
 koi todfodaur rashtriya sampatti ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaaen or trephic kaa puraa dhyaan rakhen
 He will talk to them only on the Ramlila ground
 " After conveying the message to the supporters, Anna Hazare left for Mayapuri in a procession
 khule trek main anna ke juluus ke saath- saath hajaaron logon kii bheed haath main tirangaa liye unke saath paidal march kar rahi thi
 Such a scene has rarely been seen on the streets of Delhi, when the public moved forward with slogans holding slogans in the heavy rain
 mayapuri chowk par pahunchane ke baad anna car se rajghat pahunche
 After spending 3 days in Tihar Jail, when Ramlila Maidan was prepared for the fast, Anna Hazare reached there at 2 o'clock in the afternoon on August 18 via Mayapuri and Rajghat with the procession
 vahaan unke aane kaa subah se intjaar kar rahe samarthakon ne naaron ke saath unka swaagat kiya
 On coming to the stage at Ramlila Maidan, Anna also greeted his supporters with the slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai, Inquilab Zindabad and gave him his message- “in 1942 there was a revolution in our country, which led to the British leaving
 angrej chale gaye, lekin bhrashtachar khatm nahin hua
 Therefore, the second fight for independence has started
 desh ke sabhi logon ne mere bhai, meri bahan, yuva - yuvatiyon ne yah jo mashaal jalaai he, is mashaal ko kabhi bujhane nahin dena
 The torch will continue to burn even if Anna Hazare remains
 abhi ek lokapal nahin is desh main puraa parivartan laana he
 We have to think how we will be able to give the palace to the poor affairs of the country
 kranti kii shuruyaat hochuki he
 i will not say much today because in the last three days my weight has reduced by 3 kg, but you are getting the energy of the movement you are running in the country
 ' Many countries have been made by youths, i am sure the youth of this country has awakened and now the future of this country is bright
 in gaddaaron ne desh ko lutaa he ab hambhrashtachar bardaasht nahin karenge
 We can never forget our freedom
 sar kataa sakate hai lekin sar jhukaa sakate nahin
 i am happy that there was no sabotage and no damage to national property
 ab main zyada kuch nahin kahuunga, lekin main aapse phir baat karuunga
 " 21 agast ko is andolan ko nai disha mili
 Addressing supporters at Ramlila Maidan, Anna Hazare said "vaise to is ramlila maidan main varsho se ravan jalataa aa rahaa he, magar is baar bhrashtachar kaa ravan jalegaa
 Their fight will stop only after the solution to end corruption
 mujhe kisi kaa dar nahin he
 Because i have neither any bank balance nor any assets
 mandir ke chah guna aath meter ke kamare main rahata hum
 "he called upon the people to go to the homes of the mps of their constituency and sit for their well being
 log baapu kaa priyabhajan raghupati raghav raja ram gaayen or saansadon se puuchhen ki lokapal par unki raay kya he
 He is with the government ombudsman or with the Jan Lokpal
 kyonki aap logon ne unhen vot diya he
 it's your right
 arvind kejariwal ne jaananaa chaha ki pradhanmantri bataaen ki sarkaar se kis jagah or kahaan baat kerani he
 He added further to Anna's talk that besides the mps, people should also go outside the houses of ministers and mlas in Delhi and picket and ask those people what their opinion is
 22 agast ko subah se shaam tak logon kaa saansadon or mantriyon ke gharon ke saamne jaakar pradarshan karne kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 Police also detained 50 people after demonstrating in front of Union Minister Kapil Sibal's house
 is andolan ko aage badhaane or kharchon ke liye paisa jutaney ke liye ramlila maidan main banaae gaye daan shivi par bhi logon kii lambii qatari lagi rahi
 Be it children or elderly, rich or poor, everyone was donating to this movement according to his capacity
 log apane gharon se khaanaa banaakar yahaan anna ke samarthakon ko baant rahe the
 The rich businessman, who was distributing food and drink in a truck or a laborer who was busy in cleaning the Ramlila Maidan, all were coming here on a call of Anna to the country of their own free will
 anshan ke saatven din anna kaa vajan 5 kilo kam ho gaya
 Ketones started coming in his blood and urine
 lekin unka utsaah purvavat hi bana rahaa
 Concerned over the deterioration of his health and its political impact, the government appointed Pranab Mukherjee to hold talks
 pehle daur kii vaarta kaaphi sakaaratmak rahi
 Anna supporters differed on three issues and three terms were to be considered
 sarkari vaartakaron ne iske liye agle din subah tak kaa samay liya
 Dr
 Naresh Trehan had advised Anna Hazare to drip after checking the health of Anna Hazare on the evening of Tuesday 23 August but he also refused
 raat ko logon ko sambodhit karte hue anna ne kaha ki dopaher ke baad doctoron ne kaha tha ki kidney main kuch samasya aa gai he or unhen drip ke zarie dawa deni hogi
 i told the doctors that i would listen to my conscience and tell what i would do
 meri antaratma kah rahi he ki tu ye kya kah rahaa he ki dil diya he, jaan bhi denge or jaan dene se darataa he
 

 So i have told the doctors that my conscience is saying that no medicine is to be taken
 mai mar gaya to parvaah nahin, mere baad kitne anna khadey ho gaye hai
 If something happens to their kidneys, then one of the thousands of people will give them the kidney
 doctor kii report ke baad sarkaar bhi kuch sochane lagegi or agar sarkaar kii ore se unhen jabardastee uthaakar le jane ke prayaas honto saare darwaazon par log khadey ho jaaen or mujhe le jane na dena
 "the government's position changed overnight and on 24 August it withdrew from the consensus reached yesterday
 usne jan lokapal vidheyak ko sansad main prastut karne se inkaar kar diya or anna ke anshan ko unki samasya bataaya
 The possibility of forcibly lifting Anna from the hunger strike also increased
 24 agast buudhvaar kii shaam ko samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue anna hazaare ne kaha- "do not commit violence 


 i will not tolerate violence
 agar main jail jaaun to aap log saansadon ke ghar par virodh jataao
 Do not do any harm to national property
 agar police aati he to main kushi se jail jaaoongaa
 or kal se sabko jail baro andolan karnaa he
 The country has to be saved from the path of non-violence
 ye azaadiki duusari ladaai he
 The government's attitude is not dictatorial, but dictatorship
 ye lokshahi ke liye bahut bada khatara he lekin meri vinati he ki agar sarkaar mujhe yahaan seuthae to use koi roke nahin
 Now i have understood the tricks of the government
 sarkaar chaahati he ki andolan ko todane ke liye aap log hinsa karen
 So we all have to be restrained
 "25 agast ko anshan ke 10wein din ramlila maidan main anna hajaare ne kaha ki "meraa vajan sirf 6
5 kilogram kam hua he
 The rest is fine
 mujhe aisa lag rahaa he ki main jan lokapal vidheyak paarit hone tak nahin maruunga
 i am getting a lot of energy from you
 " Demonstrations across the country continued for the tenth consecutive day in support of Anna Hazare
 lagaataar duusare din logon ne pradhanmantri awaas ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 50 of them were taken into custody
 ahimsaatmak pradarshnon se ghabaraai sarkaar kii suraksha ke naam par par dilli police ne pradhanmantri awaas ke najadik ke chaar metro steshnon- huda city centre or jahangirpuri ke bich sthit udyog bhawan, res course or jor baag tathaa kendriya sachivalay se badarpur maarg par khan market metro stesan ko dopaher teen baje se band karvaa diya
 In an interaction with Anna Hazare's representatives and the government, the Prime Minister said while trying to calm the deadlock that arose on August 24, the government is ready to discuss the bill and government bill of Aruna Rai including Jan Lokpal in the House
 bhrashtachar ke masale par loksabhaa main charchaa kii gai
 The Lok Sabha, including the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, unanimously appealed to Anna Hazare to end his fast
 iske baad kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogikimantri vilasarav deshmukh ne ramlila maidan jaakar anna hajaare ko sabhi partiyon tathaa sansad kii ore se bheja gaya patr diya or unase anshan samaapt karne kaa aagrah kiya
 On the proposal of getting the Jan Lokpal including Aruna Rai's Bill and the Government Bill discussed in the House, Anna said that "if the discussion on the Jan Lokpal Bill starts in Parliament, we will consider breaking our fast
" lekin hamaari teen mukhya maange hai
 Appointment of Lokayukta in states, bringing lower level officers also under the purview of Lokpal and make a citizen charter
 yah teenon garibon ke liye hai
 Their fast will continue until there is a consensus between the ruling party and the opposition on these issues
 pradhanmantri or puri sansad dwaara apane swasthya par chintaa jataae jane par apni pratikriya dete hue anna hajaare ne kaha ki "iske liye ham unhen dhanyavad dete hai
 But he was worried about my health today
 anna ke swasthya kii chintaa he unhen to vah 10 dinon se kahaan the
 Actually, the concern is those who have come here
 air condishan main baithne waalon ko anna ke swasthya kii chintaa nahin he
 "anna wrote to the Prime Minister in a letter to Vilasrao that-" We have great respect for our Parliament, our Parliament is the holy temple of our democracy
 " main anshan par apane kisi swaarth ke liye nahin baitha, jis tarah se aap log desh kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kar rahe hai usee tarah se main bhi desh ke logon ke bare main hi sochataa rahata hoon
 i have no power of any kind
 main ek bahut saamaanya aadmi hoon or samaaj va garib janata ke liye kuch karne kii bhaavana rakhata hoon
 Our movement is not against any person or party
 ham bhrashtachar ke kilaaf hai
 We want to change the corrupt system
 yadi hamaare andolan ke dauraan mere athwa mere kisi saathi ke dwaara kuch aise shabd kahe gaye kiye gaye hon jisase aapako yaa kisi anya vyakti ko chot pahaunchi ho to main ham sabaki taraf se dilgir vyakt karata hoon
 It is not our goal to hurt anyone
 har rajya main isi kaanoon ke zarie lokayukta bhi banaae jaaen, har vibhaag main jan samasyaon ke liye citizans charter banaae jaae jise na maanane par sambandhit adhikari par karrwai ho or teesraa ye ki centre sarkaar ke upar se neeche tak sabhi karmchaariyon or rajya ke sabhi karmchaariyon ko iske daayre main laayaa jaae
 Can a motion be brought to Parliament on these three things? i have no hope that all our mps will be ready at the beginning to rid the people of the country of corruption every day
 My conscience says that if these things are agreed in Parliament, then i should break my fast
 " The rest of the Jan Lokpal bill, such as the selection process, is also very important to prevent corruption
 main meri janata ke saath tab tak ramlila maidan main baitha rahoonga jab tak baaqi saare muddon par sansad main nirnay nahin ho jaataa kyonki yahi janata kii awaz he
 So many people have joined me all over the country in the hope that they will get rid of corruption
 iske liye jaruri he ki rajyon main bhi lokayukta ke gathan ke liye kanoon paas ho
 There should be a system to fight against the corruption of the officials, who have to face two-four daily corruption
 isi tarah sabhi sarkari sevaaon ke liye samaysima tay ho or unhen samay par puraa nahin karne vaale adhikari par jurmaana lage
 This letter of Anna was also discussed at the Anna Hazare Prime Minister's residence, but the attitude of the government remained the same the next day
 
 With this, the government had prepared a section of media through advertisements and other means which was now trying to justify their favor
 kai sanchaar madhyam anna team ke bich foot, pradarshkon ke bich lokapal kii kam samajhadaari aadi vishay uthaane lage the
 Despite this the movement was continuing and the government was under increasing pressure
 sansad kii kaarywai kaa sidhaa prasaaran dekhakar evam netaaon ke bayaan or chehre dekhakar janata anna ke saath rahane ke nirnay par atal thi
 On August 26, after remaining silent for 11 days, Rahul Gandhi, who is considered the future helper of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, said - "it is a dangerous practice to reduce the dignity of democracy
" vyaktigat rup se kai logon ne desh ko mahatvapurn yogadan diya he lekin ye samajhnaa zaruri he ki loktantric prakriya kaa apana mahatv he, loktantricprakriya lambii zarur hoti he par isse sabhi ko apana vichaar rakhane kaa mauka miltaa he
 

 In the past, it is being understood that the coming out of an ombudsman law will get rid of corruption, but it is wrong, just by enacting an ombudsman law will not end corruption, but it will have to find solutions to many more challenges
 Kiran Bedi wrote on Twitter that, "it may not be enough for an ombudsman to get started
" "rahul gandhi ke bayaan se acroshit anna hajaare ke samarthakon ne shuukravaar ko unke tughlaq road sthit awaas ke baahar pradarshnakia or jamkar narebaaji kii
 Police took 50 of Anna's supporters into custody
 rahul gandhi ne apane ghar ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe anna samarthakon ke liye cold drinks or samose bhijwaaye
 On 27 August, the government debated Anna's three main demands in Parliament
 
 By 8 o'clock in the night, both the houses of Parliament passed a resolution to send it to the Standing Committee to consider these conditions by voice
 sansad ke donon sadanon main shanivaar ko lokapal mudde par anna hajaare kii maangon ke anuroop laae gaye prastaav par saidhantik rup se sahmati banane ke baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa patr lekar kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri vilasarav deshmukh, saansad sandip dikshit or purv kendriya mantri vilaas mutemvaar ne anna ko ramlila maidan pahunchakar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare addressed the supporters and said, "jan Lokpal has won this half
 puri jeet abhi baaki he
 This is the victory of the entire youth power
 yah janataki jeet he
 This is the victory of social organization
 yah media kii jeet he
 "I want to end my fast in the presence of you all at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, that too with your permission
 aap jashn jarur manaaen lekin dhyaan rakhen ki isse shanti bhang na ho or kisi ko pareshaani na ho
 Anna ended the fast on 28 August by drinking honey-mixed coconut water at the hands of Simran, a five-year-old girl from the Dalit community of Sundernagri, and Iqra, a Muslim from Turkman Gate
 anna ke anshan sthagit karne se pehle unke pramukh sahyogi arvind kejariwal ne apane lambey vaktavy main manch se logon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki wo sabhi raajnneetik dalon kaa dhanyavad karte hai or saath hi logon kaa bhi jinke sadakon par aane ke kaaran sarkaar par dabaav bana
 This proposal would not have passed without the cooperation of the parties
 We thank them
 


samvidhan logon ne banaaya he or sabase upar log hai jiske baad samvidhan, sansad or saansad aate hai
 The laws in Parliament were made according to the wishes of the people
 anna yaa anna kaa andolan samvidhan ke kilaaf nahin he jaisaa ki team ke bare main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he
 After breaking the fast, Anna thanked the people of the country, especially the youth, media, police and doctors for their care in making the movement successful and said that "they have just postponed their fast but their fight will continue 
 asli anshan puri ladaai jeetne ke baad tuutegaa
 i will roam across the country till the fight is over
 unhen vishwaas he ki unke madhyam se saamne laae gaye janata ke muddon se sansad inkaaranheen karegi
 But if the parliament refused, then the mass parliament would have to be ready
 aaj yah baat sabit ho gai he ki jan sansad, dilli kii sansad se badi he
 Whatever the Parliament wants, the Parliament of Delhi has to accept it
 hamen baba sahib ambedkar ke banaae samvidhan ke tahat is desh main parivartan laana he
 Today it has been proved that change can be brought
 ham bhrashtachar mukt bharat kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 This is just the beginning
 lambi ladaai aage he
 It is the question of the farmers, the question of the workers
 paryaavaran, pani, tel jaise tamaam mudde hai
 It is a question of education of poor children
 hamen chunaav sudhaar bhi karne hai
 The entire system has to be changed
 hamaara asli anshan is puure badlaav ke baad hi tuutegaa
 Today such a big movement took place in the country, but completely non-violent
 duniya ke saamne aap sabhi ne misaal rakhi he ki andolan kaise karnaa chahie
 This has been the most important thing in this movement
 22 agast ko pradhanmantri ne vitt mantri pranav mukherjee, raksha mantri e
ke
 antni va grih mantri pi
 chidambaram se charchaa ke baad sarkaar ne pranav mukherjee ko vaartakar niyukt kiya or anna ko patr likhakar is sarkari pahal kii jaankaree di
 After this, Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid and Anna's aide Arvind Kejriwal and Akhil Gogoi met at the residence of Congress MP Sandeep Dixit
 iske baad arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar vaarta ke liye taiyaar ho gai he
 Pranab Mukherjee has been appointed for this
 23 agast kii raat ko pehle daur kii vaarta main sarkaar kii ore se mukherjee va salmaan khurshid ne bhaag liya
 Kiran Bedi, Arvind Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan joined on behalf of civil society
 sarkaar ne vaarta ko santoshjanak bataaya
 The government expressed concern over Anna's health and said that talks would be held again on Wednesday morning
 anna dal ke sadsy arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar or hamaare bich teen muddon par asahmati he
 The government has sought time till Wednesday morning to consider them
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar ne anna se anshan todane kii bhi apil kii he
 But in the conversation that took place today, nothing came out that we should ask Annaji to break the fast
 vaarta main sarkaar kuch muddon par sahamat ho gai thi
 But many subjects had not yet been agreed
 iske saath hi anna ke sahyogi kuch sharton par sarkaar kii manjuuri bhi chaahate the
 Keeping in mind the re-talks with Anna's colleagues in the morning, late night the Prime Minister called an emergency meeting on the Anna issue and discussed it with senior ministers
 iske turant baad congress kor group kii baithak bhi hui
 But the result of all these exercises came to the contrary on 24 August
 sarkaar kaa rukh bilkul badal gaya tha
 After a conversation with Pranab Mukherjee, Prashant Bhushan said that the government's stand was very positive in the talks held on Tuesday, but on Wednesday everything looked like a revenge
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar ne saafe kar diya he ki wo jan lokapal bill ko pesh nahin karegi
 Kiran Bedi said that Pranab Mukherjee appeared in a rage as soon as the meeting started on Wednesday and he was saying that you should keep doing it
 anna ke anshan ke bare main sarkaar ne kaha ki wo unki yani naagarik samaaj or anna hazaare kii samasya he
 i don't know why it changed in the government's attitude in one day and night
 mangalvaar ko wo hamaari baaten sun rahe the, aaj wo apni baaten suna rahe the
 Yesterday, he was respecting our words
 kal or aaj main din-raat kaa fark aayaa he
 " is gatirodh ke pashchaat 25 agast ko pradhanmantri ne vilasarav deshmukh ko patr dekar anna ke paas bheja
 Anna assured to quit the fast after three things were approved
 27 agast ko sansad kii kaaryava ke saath hi anna ke sahyogiyon se bhi lagaataar barta chal rahi thi
 But the government was not making its stand clear
 antat shaam tak in vaartaon kaa parinaam anna kii teen maangon par sansad ke samarthan ke prastaav ke rup main aayaa
 Vilas Rao Deshmukh again came to Ramlila Maidan with a letter from the Prime Minister to inform about it
 jiske pashchaat anna ne 28 agast ko anshan sthagit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anna's weight had decreased by seven and a half kilos due to the 13-day fast
 unka rakt chaap kaaphi kam ho gaya tha
 Doctor Trehan, who has been continuously checking Anna's health for 13 days, said that Anna's body is deficient in water and he has become very weak
 unke swasthya par nazar rakhane ke liye unhen kuch dinon ke liye gudgaanv ke ek aspataal main bhartee kar liya gaya
 The whole country was engulfed in celebration with the announcement of Anna's demands in Parliament on 27 August and Anna's announcement of ending the fast on 28 August
 rajdhani dilli, mumbai, kolkata, patna, ranchi, lakhanu, bengaluru, shimla, jaipur, raipur, gandhinagar sahit puure desh main diwaali jaisaa maahaul ban gaya
 In Delhi, Anna Hazare's supporters reached India Gate waving the tricolor and shouting slogans to express their happiness
 log deshbhakti ke geeton par jhuumate najar aae
 Several individuals got out of the cars and joined the procession
 rajdhani raipur sahit chhattisgarh ke bilaspur, korba, raigarh main bhi anna hajaare samarthakon ne pataakhe jalaae or vijay ke uplakshya main naare lagaae
 If people left firecrackers in various mohallas of Patna, many people distributed sweets
 kargil chowk par pichley 12 dinon se anna ke samarthan main dharna or anshan par baithe log shanivaar der shaam jashn manaane main mashgool ho gaye
 Many people went to the temple to thank God and pray for taking care of Anna Hazare's health
 patna ke saath hi rajya ke darbhanga, purniya, saharsa, mujffarpur, bhagalpur sahit kai jilon main is janata kii jeet kaa jasn manaaya gaya
 It was really only a moral victory
 itihaas jarur bana tha kintu kaagajon par kisi thos cheez kaa nikalakar aana abhi baaki tha
 Yes, it definitely made way for him

 It is worth noting that the consumer is the one who purchases goods and services for consumption

 Is it necessary that a buyer use the goods? It does not always happen
 yadi aap apane likhane ke liye ek kapi kharidte hai to aap kreta bhi hai or upabhokta bhi
 Suppose your father purchases food, which is consumed by all the family members or when he purchases laundry detergent powder, all the family members and others can use it

 The main difference between consumption of goods and services is that goods can be physically tested before purchase, while the reliability and continuity of services cannot be tested in advance

 But you cannot check whether the power voltage will remain constant at all times

 But we cannot do this in relation to transport services or repair, electricity supply or telephone service or film shows

 To protect the interests of consumers, the government has recognized certain rights of consumers
 duusare shabdon main yadi upabhokta apane aapako shoshan evam dhokhe se bachaana chaahate hai to unhen kuch adhikaron ko manyata pradaan kerani hogi
 In other words, if consumers want to protect themselves from exploitation and deception, they have to give some rights so that they are in such a situation that they can be cautious while dealing with the sellers of goods and service providers
 udhaaharan ke liye upabhoktaaon ke adhikaron main se ek adhikaar chayan kaa adhikaar he
 If you are aware of this right, then you can ask the shopkeeper to show different varieties of the same item, so that you can choose the item of your choice

 kahawat he ki bina uttardaayitv ke adhikaar nahin ho sakate
 After evaluating the rights of consumers and the objectives of these rights, it is necessary to understand whether there should be some responsibilities of the consumer so that they can exercise their rights
 udhaaharan ke liye upabhokta yadi yah chaahate hai ki ve apni sunwaayee ke adhikaar kaa prayog kar saken to unka yah bhi uttardayiv he ki vah apni samasyaon ko jaane tathaa unke sambandh main soochnaaon ko praapt karte rahen
 In order to use the right to redress their grievances, consumers should be careful about choosing the right item at the price and they should also learn how to use those items to prevent any injury or loss
 upabhokta ke dayitvon main vishesh rup se nimna daayitv sammalit hai : In addition to these obligations, there are other obligations of the consumer
 unhen vinirmaataa, vyapaaree evam seva pradaankarta ke saath apane anubandh kaa sakhti se paalan karnaa chahie
 In the event of a credit purchase, he should be paid on time
 unhen seva ke madhyam jaise bijli evam pani ke meter, bas evam rail gadiyon kii siton ke saath ched-chhaad nahin kerani chahie
 He should remember that he can exercise his rights only when he is ready or willing to fulfill his obligations
