 Her father, Morris, used to do whatever he could because of the economic difficulties of the time, including work at the local knitting company and Murphy's Irish Stout Factory

 is avadhi main vah rockmount main ek or honhaar footbal khilaadi ke rup main viksit ho rahaa tha or uski kshamta tab ujagar hui jab use uske pehle satr main varsh ke khilaadi ke rup main chunaa gaya
 Keane used to be a supporter of Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur in his childhood and named Liam Brady and Glenn Hoddle among his favorite players, but with the passage of time, Manchester United's Brian Robson turned to his dramatic, box-to-box style, He became the most acclaimed football player due to his fame as Captain Marvel
 yahi gun keen main bhi bahutayat se the or use yah pataa bhi nahin tha ki vah antat old traverd main robasan kaa dirghakaalik vikalp banegaa
 Despite his promising career, his future career in football seemed uncertain
 He was dropped from an Ireland schoolboys squad after an exam in Dublin - a reason given by former Ireland coaches and scouts that the fourteen-year-old Keane was too young to reach the required level
 bina niraash hue, usne inglish klbon kii parikshaon ke liye aavedan karnaa shuru kar diya, lekin prayek ne use manaa kar diya
 uske bachapan ke varshon ke guzarane ke saath, apane footbal ke bhavishya main safalataa paane kii pratiksha karte hue vah haath se kiye jane vaale kaamchalaoo kaam karne laga
 1989 main, antat usne rembler kii yuvak team ke manager eddy o rurke ke samajhane ke baad ardh-peshewar irish club kobh remblers ke liye hastakshar kiye
 keen dublin main udghaatit ekeai / ethees skim main remblers ke do pratinidhiyon main se ek tha or is shuruuaat ke jariye use purna-kaalik prashikshan kaa pehla swaad chakhne ko mila
 uskaa ek honhaar footbal khilaadi ke rup main teji se vikaas is tathy se parilakshith hota tha ki vah rembler kii niyamit yuva team ke liye or vaastavik pehali team ke liye kheltaa tha, jiske parinamswaroop ek hi saptahanth main vah akasar do baar khel letaa tha
 In the strict, physical world of the Irish First Division, Keane kept himself in front of far more experienced players than himself, and his dedication to training was noticed by many
 dublin ke belwedir epasi ke viruddh ek mahatvapurn ekeai match main keen ke pradarshan ne match dekh rahe nottingham foresti ke scout noel mccabe kaa dhyaan khinchaa, jisane use ek abhyaas ke liye england aane ke liye kaha
 keen ne foresti ke prabandhak brian chlo or uske staff ko prabhavit kiya or antat 1990 ke greeshm main keen ke liye kobh remblers ke saath 47,000 pound kaa ek sauda kiya gaya
 Although Keen was happy to sign for a big club, he initially found life in Nottingham difficult due to being away from his family for a long time, and often returned from the club for a few days off to return to Cork
 Used to ask keen ne uski yachanaon par dhyaan dete samay chlo kii udaartaa ke liye kritagyata jataai kyonki isse club main uske praarambhik kathin din gujaarne main use kaaphi sahaayta mili
 foresti main keen ke pehle game 21 varsh se kam waalon kii team main holland main ek satrapurv ke toornament main khele gaye
 In the final against Harlem, he played a winning penalty in a shootout that ensured the event, and was soon climbing up the club categories and playing in the reserve team regularly
 uskaa peshewar lig shriganesh 1990-91 satr ke prarambh main liverpool ke viruddh hua or usamen uske pradarshan ne chlo ko satr ke aage badhane ke saath adhik se adhik uskaa prayog karne ke liye utsahit kiya
 He eventually scored his first professional goal against Sheffield United and by 1991 he had become a regular starter in his team, displacing England International's Steve Hodge
 1991 egge cap final, jisamen foresti antat totenham hotspur se haar gaya tha, main pravishti ke liye khelte samay keen ne teen gol kiye
 lekin tisare daur main crystal pales ke viruddh usne ek keemtee galati kar di, jisase virdohi team ko ek gol uphaar main mil gaya or ve khel ko anirnit karne main kaamyaab ho gaye
 Upon returning to the dressing room after the game, Chloe angrily punched Keane's face and dropped him on the floor
 Despite this incident, Keane did not mind having any grudge against his manager and later said that due to management pressures he has sympathy for Chloe and is very grateful to her for giving him a chance in English football
 ek varsh ke baad keen foresti ke saath wembli lig cap final ke liye aayaa lekin phir se haarane vaali team main rahaa kyonki uske bhavishya ke club manchester united ne 1-0 se jeet hasil kar lee
 Keane was attracting the attention of the Premier League's top clubs, and in 1992, Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish spoke to Keane about the possibility of his arrival at the Lancashire club at the end of the season
 Given the greater likelihood of Forrest struggling in the league and being deported, Keane negotiated with him for a new contract containing the deportation protection clause
 The conversation lasted for a long time and was the subject of great discussion in public and Brian Chloe called it a greedy child for the high salary demanded by Kean
 Chloe said, Kean is currently the most fiery prospect in football, but we will not let him make this club bankrupt
 Forest fans, however, forgave Keane by choosing him as the club's season player due to his struggling performances at the end of the campaign
 blakebern ne keen ko £4 million fees dena manjuur kar liya or iske turant baad vah club ke saath ek anubandh ke liye sahamat ho gaya
 There was also speculation that Keane would sign for Arsenal, who were looking for a young midfielder at the time as a replacement for Paul Davis
 lekin kagajaton par hastakshar hone ke ek din pehle, manchester united ke manager elex fergyusan ne keen ko phone kiya or poocha ki kya vah blakebern kii bajaay unke saath aana pasand karegaa
 use blakebern se hue uske samjhaute ko radd karne ke liye samajhaayaa gaya or do hafton main hi usne manchester united ke saath £3
75 million ke liye hastakshar kar diye, jo us samay kaa ek british hastantaran ricard tha
 In her autobiography, Keane details her conversation with angry and angry Kenny Dalglish when she tells him that her signature plan with Blackburn has been postponed
 badi hastantaran fees hone ke baavjood is baat kii koi guarantee nahin thi ki keen sidhe pehali team main jayega
 bryaan robasan or paal ins ne midfield ke centre main ek joardaar sahabhaagita bana lee thi or unhone manchester united ko 1967 ke baad unka pehla khitaab dilvaaya tha
 But Robson was now 36 years old and in the final stages of his player career, and could not play in the 1993–94 season due to injuries sustained
 keen ne team main apni safalataa kaa puraa phayda uthaaya or 18 agast 1993 ko shefield united ke viruddh uske pehle match main do gol kiye or teen maheene baad manchester darbi main jeet hasil kar lee, jab united ne 2-0 ke nuksaan ko palat kar main road main manchester city ko 3-2 se haraa diya

 Two weeks later, Keane won the club their first double title by defeating United 4–0 over Chelsea in the FA Cup final and also erased their line of defeat at Wembley
 aglaa satr kam safal rahaa, kyonki lig khitaab ke liye blakebern rovers ne united ko haraa diya or ve egge cap final main averton se 1-0 se haar gaye
 He received his first red card as a Manchester United player in an FA Cup final against Crystal Palace, when he tore Gareth Southgate and was suspended for three matches and fined £ 5,000 as punishment
 Gone
 yah ghatana apane united ke karier main keen dwaara ekatrit gyaarah laal cardon main pehali thi or uske ugr bartaav ke pehle chinhon main se ek thi jisase maidan main araajaktaa utpann hone lagi thi
 The summer of 1995 was a transition time for United when the Inns left him and moved to Internazionale and striker Mark Hughs moved to Chelsea and Andre Canthelkis was sold to Everton
 yuva khilaadi jaise david becam, nikki batt or paal scoles team main laae gaye, jisase keen midfield main sabase anbhavi khilaadi ke rup main rah gaya
 Despite a slow start to the 1995–96 campaign, United won another Premier League title by defeating title challenger Newcastle United, who had a 12-point championship lead under Christmas
 kade pratipakshi liverpool par 1-0 kii vijay ke saath ricard naunvi baar egge cap jeet kar teen varshon main keen kaa doosraa doharaa khitaab pakkaa ho gaya
 In the following season, Keane kept coming to the team due to a series of knee injuries and frequent suspension
 He received a costly yellow card in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-finals against Borussia Dortmund, forcing him to withdraw from the return stage at Old Trafford
 United lost 1–0 in both of these stages but it was offset a few days later by winning another league title
 erik cantona ke anpekshit avkaash le lene ke baad, keen ne club ke captain ke rup main bagdor sambhaal lee lekin satr ke naunve premier lig khel main leeds united ke khilaadi alf-inge haland ko rokane kii koshish main crushiet snaayu kii chot ke kaaran 1997-98 ke adhikansh bhaag se use vanchit rahanaa padaa
 jab keen jameen par aundha padaa tha, tab helland us ke paas thahar kar united ke jakhmi captain par use chot pahunchane kii koshish karne or sajaa se bachane ke liye jakhmi hone kaa dikhaava karne kaa aarope laga rahaa tha; yah ek aisa aarope tha jiske kaaran chaar varshon ke baad donon khilaadiyon ke bich ek bura vivaad hua
 That time Keane did not return to competitive football
 When United were losing an 11-point lead over Arsenal and losing in the Premier League title, they were watching it all from outside the field
 lig trophy main team ke aatmasamarpan kaa mukhya kaaran kai panditon ne keen kii anupasthiti ko bataaya
 prarambh main usne shankaa jaahir kii ki uski chot kii gambhirtha ke kaaran vah phir kabhi khel paaegaa bhi yaa nahin, lekin samay par swasthya laabh karke vah nae abhiyaan ke liye abhyaas main jute gaya
 "it was the most emphatic display of selflessness i have seen on a football field
 Pounding over every blade of grass, competing if he would rather die of exhaustion than lose, he inspired all around him
 i felt it was an honor to be associated with such a player
 " keen kii chot ke kaaran khilaadi ke rup main uske prabhaav main kami aa jane ke vishay main sabhi bhay 1998-99 ke sijan main dur ho gaye, jab usne apni team ke captain ke rup main laut kar egge premier lig, egge cap or yuiefee champions lig kaa athulaneey tihara khitaab jeet liya
 One of his great performances in this campaign was his performance against Juventus in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final, when he outscored his team to a two-goal loss to win 3–2, a game that was Which is considered one of the best performances in any football field in the modern era of European football across Europe
 usne sir se maar kar ek gol karke united kii vaapasi kii shuruuaat kii or lagaataar har maukey par team ko aage kii ore badhaayaa
 tourin main uske pradarshan ko footbal khilaadi ke rup main uske sabase badhiya kshan ke rup main mana gaya he
 But Keane was handed a yellow card early in the match that led to his exit from the final after a trip to Jeanneidine Zidane
 final main, nou camp main united ne beyem munikh ko 2-1 se haraaya, lekin apane nilamban ke kaaran keen ke man main us vijay ke bare main mishrit bhavanaaen thim
 Recalling his thoughts before the game, Kean said, "although i was pretending to be a brave, it was my worst experience in football
" baad main us saal, intercantinental cap ke finelon main keen ne keval ek gol banaaya, jisamen united ne palmiras ko haraaya
 Discussions of the contract dominated the state in the summer following the triple title, in which Keane turned down United's offer of £ 2 million a year amid rumors of a move to Italy
 His increased demands were eventually accepted in the mid-1999–00 season and he promised to stay with United until 2004
 Keane was angry that club officials explained the reason for the increase in season ticket prices to his revised contract and asked the club to apologize
 a few days after the contract was signed Keane celebrated with a winning goal against Valencia in the Champions League, although United's interest in the tournament was ended by Real Madrid in the quarterfinals, partly by Keane in the second leg
 Due to an unfortunate self-goal
 keen ne disambar 2000 main ek vivaad utpann kiya jab old trefersso main dynamo kiv par champions lig vijay hasil karne ke baad usne united ke samarthakon kii aalochana kii
 usne kiv dwaara khel par haaavee hone ke samay kuch prashansakon dwaara maukhik samarthan na dene ke bare main shikaayat kii or kaha, "ghar se dur hamaare prashansak bahut achche hai, main unhen kattar kah saktaa hum
 lekin ghar par ve log kuch peya or shaayad kuch zinga sandvichein le lete hai or yah nahin jaanate ki maidan main kya ho rahaa he
 i don't think some of Old Trafford's people could even say "football", let alone understand
 "kean's talk sparked a debate about changing the atmosphere in football grounds in England, And the term 'shrimp Sandwich Brigade' is now a part of the English Football Dictionary, which is used for people who go to football games or claim to be football fans May include not because it is fashionable that because there is no real interest in playing them
 vah phir se 2001 manchester darbi, ek khel jisamen alf-inge haland ne khelaa tha, main surkhiyon main aayaa
 Five minutes before the final whistle was sounded, he was sent off for a clear knee-high foul at Norweigh, considered by many to be a clear revenge action
 use pehle egge dwaara teen khelon kaa suspension or £5000 jurmaana kiya gaya, lekin agast 2002 keen kii aatmakatha ke prakashit hone ke baad use or sajaa di gai jisamen usne kaha ki vah helland ko chot pahunchaana chahta tha
 Kean's statement about the incident is as follows: main kaaphi pratiksha kar chukaa tha
 i hit him hard
 gend vahaan par thi
 Withstand it And now never stand in front of me and talk about fake injuries
 yah is baat kii sweekruti thi ki vah chot vastav main purvanishchit hamalaa tha jiske baad egge ke paas keen par khel ko badnaam karne kaa aarope lagane ke alaava koi chaara na rahaa
 use baad main hui jaanch ke baad or paanch khelon ke liye pratibandh laga diya gaya or £150,000 kaa jurmaana kiya gaya
 Despite widespread criticism, she later stated in her autobiography that she had no remorse over the incident
 "meraa ravaiya tha ki use maaro
 jaisaa chalata he, vaisaa hi hota he
 He got the right reward
 He had troubled me and my attitude is, take one eye for another
 united ne chaar varshon main pehali baar 2001-02 kaa satr bina koi trophy jite samaapt kiya
 At home, he was eliminated in the fourth round by Middlesbrough from the FA Cup and finished third in the Premier League, his lowest in the league since 1991
 phir bhi, unhone yarope main tarakkee kii jahaan united yuiefee champions lig ke semi-final main pahunchaa, jo 1999 ke unke safal abhiyaan ke baad sabase adhik badhat thi
 They eventually knocked out based on subsequent goals, despite Keane giving United a 3–2 lead, following a 3-3 total draw with Bayer Leverkusen, and Keen's team's loss to United
 Some fellows attributed the focus on the property and said that they had forgotten the game, lost the hunger that got you Rolex, cars, luxurious houses
 us satr main pehle keen ne janata ke saamne tihara khitaab jeetne vaali team ko tod dene kii vakaalat kii kyonki vah maanata tha ki united ke vijayi 1999 champions lig final main khilne vaale team ke saathiyon main ab utani mehnat karne kii prerana nahin rahi thi
 He was fined £ 150,000 by Ferguson in August 2002, and Sunderland's Jason mcateer was suspended from three matches for elbow hitting and was extended by another five matches for the Controversial comments about Holland
 keen ne is avkaash kaa prayog apane kuulhe kaa ek aaparishan karwaane ke liye kiya, jiske kaaran use ek saal tak dardanivarak lene pade the
 Initially fearing that the injury could be detrimental to his career, and despite his surgeon's need for future hip-dislocation, he returned to the United team by December
 I'd come to one firm conclusion, which was to stay on the pitch for ninety minutes in every game
 In other words, to curb the reckless, intemperate streak in my nature that led to sendings-off and injuries
 In the post-operation rest period, Keane considered the reasons for his recurring injuries and suspensions
 usne nishchay kiya ki in samasyaon kaa kaaran uski chunautiyaan or cruddh vaktavy the jinhone uske karier ko nuksaan pahunchaaya tha
 As a result, he became more controlled in the field and tried to avoid disputes and disputes with other players
 Some observers felt that the new Roy Keane had become less dominant in midfield due to a change in his playing style, which was probably due to the decreased movement following his hip operation
 lekin, uske lautne ke baad keen ne apni vahi puraani majbootee darshai, or may 2003 main team ko ek or lig kaa khitaab dilvaaya
 Throughout the 2000s, Keane maintained a healthy contest with Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira
 The most special incident between them occurred in Highbury in 2005 at the height of an extreme period of hostility between United and Arsenal
 Vieira was prevented by United's defender Gary Neville in the first match between the two teams in a cave to foul Jose Antonio Reis, for which Keane verbally defied the Arsenal captain
 The incident was broadcast live by Sky Sport, where Keane was heard telling match referee Graham Poole, "tell him to keep his mouth shut!" But Vieira later said that Keane is not in a good position to express such views after being dropped from his national team in the World Cup finals
 referi pole ne baad main bataaya ki use donon khilaadiyon ko match shuru hone ke pehle baahar bhej dena chaiye tha, haalanki vah aisa na karne ke liye dabaav main tha
 Overall, United won 9 major titles under Keane's leadership, making him the most successful captain in the club's history
 Keane scored his 50th goal for Manchester United on 5 February 2005 in a league game against the city of Birmingham
 In the 2005 FA Cup final, in which United lost to Arsenal in a penalty shootout, it was his seventh game in his presence, an all-time record in English football at the time
 keen sanyukt rup se inglish footbal main sabase adhik laal card paane vaale khilaadi kaa ricard bhi rakhata he, or apane saare karier main kul 13 baar barkhaast kiya gaya tha
 He was admitted to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2004 as a recognition of his undisputed influence on the English game and became the only Irish player to be selected in the FIFA 100, a list of the greatest living football players selected by Pelé

 Ferguson was further infuriated by Keane's acceptance at the time of a MUTV phone-in that "he would be ready to play elsewhere" when his ongoing contract with United ended at the end of the season
 “he was our captain, he was our leader and he left a mark: where we are now is down to him, our dedication comes from the standards he set
 The rules about time-keeping, about getting in a half-hour early, they were his instructions back in the day and those traditions continue
” Keane's performance on MUTV sparked further controversy when he criticized John o'shea, Alan Smith, Karen Richardson and Darren Fletcher for their performances after a bad 4–1 defeat at the hands of Middlesbrough in early November
 Took advantage of However, the most rigorous analysis was for the memorable signature of Rio Ferdinand by the club
 "sirf isaliye ki tumhen £120,000 prati saptaah milte hai or totonham ke viruddh tum 20 minute ke liye acha khel lete ho, tum samajhate ho ki tum ek superstar ho
" is vaktavy ko unided ke prabandhakon dwaara bahut apmanjanak samajha gaya or baad main club ke tivi stesan dwaara sancharan se use nikaal diya gaya
 Keane's views were also explosive according to his own criteria, according to people interviewed
 “happiness is not being afraid
” Two weeks later, after another altercation with Ferguson, Keane entered into an agreement with Manchester allowing him to leave the club immediately so that he could sign a long-term contract with another club
 It was proposed to do a testimonial for him in Old Trafford in honor of the time he spent twelve and a half years, and both Ferguson and United's chief executive David Gill congratulated him for the future
 On 15 December 2005, Keane was announced as a Celtic player following an agreement on a contract of £ 40,000 a week, a team he had supported as a child

 Then he waged a verbal war against macarthy: Mick you are a liar 


 you are a wanker
 i did not consider you as a player, i do not count you as a manager nor do you count me as a man
 You are a canker and you keep your World Cup with you
 There is only one reason for me to talk to you and that is that you are somehow the manager of my country! Niall Quinn stated in his autobiography that, Roy Keane's 10-minute speech 


 was clear, frantic, tearing up the ground for the person listening to it and that eventually sparked a major controversy in Irish society
 But at the same time he criticized Kean's ideas, saying that, he had left us in Saipan, not on the contrary
 or waapas na laut kar hamase zyada apane aapako usne sajaa di thi
 None of Keane's teammates supported him in the gathering, though some later supported him in private

 Mick mcarthy resigned as manager of Ireland after losing to Russia and Switzerland in the qualification games at Euro 2004
 The possibility of Keen returning to the squad for the future qualification games was raised as Keen had not yet fully retired from international football and it was said that Kean's main reason for staying away from the Irish contingent was Macarthy's Was present

 Keane again expressed his unhappiness about the fei's attitude and election policy
 In March 2007 Keane stated that many players from the Republic of Ireland were selected only on the basis of their performance in the media and that the organization was inclined towards players coming from Dublin or other areas of Leinster: "if you name them created in the media Based on or because they give a lot of interviews, let them play, then it is wrong
 bharose or bevakoofi ke bich ek maheen rekha hoti he
 "kean said that Sunderland player Liam Miller was not selected because he was a resident of Cork and that players of good caliber were being denied selection to the national team
 usne yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki ekeai apane kaarobaar ko chalaane main samarth tha
 Keane got caught in another controversy after Ireland's defeat at the hands of France in the World Cup 2010 game
 20 navambar 2009 ko ipaswitch toun kii ek samvaadadaata sammelan ke samay, keen ne henry handbal ghatana ke prati irish pratikriya kii aalochana kii

 His former manager Sir Alex Ferguson had previously said "that he wanted Keane to succeed him as coach of Manchester United after his retirement
 But, after Keane's bitter exit from the club, Ferguson became Keane's manager "the young managers keep coming in and people say that it will become the manager of England or the boss of this club, but two years old Prahlad they are not there
 It is not an easy environment to gain entry, i will not make any kind of prediction
 " celtic main rahane ke samay, keen ko bhootpurv celtic khilaadi charlie nicholas dwaara gordan strawchan ke bhavi managereey uttaradhikari banane kii salaah di gai
 However, Keane chose Championship club Sunderland to begin his managerial career, where he was reunited with club president and retiring manager Niall Quinn

" Keen signed a three-year contract on August 28, soon after Sunderland's win over West Bramwich Albion, which was Mackens' first win in the 2006–07 season, after four consecutive defeats in Kinn's executive management
 As his new club had already moved from the bottom of the championship table to second position and into the relegation zone, Keane decided to make a rapid change
 manager ke rup main uske pehla kaam vartmaan sahaayak manager bobi saxton ko banaae rakhane or nottingham foresti main uske bhootpurv saathi tony laflon ko mukhya coach kaa pad dene kaa nishchay karnaa tha
 He did not delay in bringing new people into the squad, and six players signed on the last day of the August transfer period
 Key signatories were former Keith's Manchester United teammates Dwight Yorke and Liam Miller, assisted by former Celtic teammates Ross Wallace and Stanislav Warga, and Wigan's athlete duo, Graham Kavanagh and David Connolly
 manager ke rup main keen ke pehle do khel isse behatar nahin ho sakate the; pehle main peeche se lautakar darbi county ko 2-1 se haraaya, jiske baad leeds united par 3-0 kii aasaan vijay hasil kii

 Five more players were signed during the January 2007 transfer period, three on permanent contracts and two on loan from Keane's old club Manchester United
 Results continued to improve and Keane was rewarded as the manager of the month of February and March, when his team began to challenge for automatic promotion spots
 tabhi keen ne uske khilaadiyon ke apeshewar taur-tareekon se dridhtaa se nipta
 march 2007 main jab bamsle kii yatra ke liye team ke coach tak pahunchane main teen khilaadiyon ne der kii to vah unhen peeche chhod kar nikal gaya

 ek saptaah baad, coca cola championships khitaab pakkaa kar liya gaya or keen kii dekharekh main sunderland kaa punarutthan puraa ho gaya
 His achievements also earned him the championship "manager of the Year" award
 One sign of Keane's greater ambitions was the determination not to parade an open bus from above in the city to celebrate the promotion
 kuch log kehete hai ki sunderland kaa premier lig main 2007-08 satr choton or unke viruddh gaye refriyon ke nirnyon, donon ke kaaran badakismati se bharaa tha
 But many pundits praised his fighting spirit in managing Keen and supported him for his life
 unke satr kaa sabase bura kshan gudison park main tab aayaa jab ve averton se 7-1 se haar gaye, jise keen ne uske karier ke sabase bure kshanon main se ek bataaya
 lekin satr ke dwitiyardh main team ke khel main kaaphi sudhaar aayaa or divijan main do khelon ke rahete, middlebaro ke viruddh ghar main hui ek jeet ke baad unka bachanaa nishchit ho gaya
 Along with this, Keane continued his pursuit of buying former Manchester players, including Kieran Richardson, Paul mcshane, Danny Higginbatham and Pill Bardsley
 He also kept his strict discipline policy in place by keeping Liam Miller on the transfer list for regular delays in training and other team meetings
 2008-09 ke satr kaa prarambh kolahalapurna siddh hua
 In September 2008, Keane became involved in a feud with FIFA Vice President Jack Warner to withdraw Dwight York from the Trinidad and Tobago national team
 warner ne keen par chote deshon kii izzat na karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 keen ne jawaab main warner ko "ek masakhra" kah kar bulaayaa or jor diya ki york antarrashtriya footbal se ritair ho chukaa tha
 In the same month Keane experienced one of the worst and longest nights of his career when Sunderland had to come back at home in a League Cup game against Northampton, 2–0
 Sunderland were able to progress with difficulty on penalties and the game ended 2–2

 Keane has worked for the media but expressed lack of enthusiasm to do it again in the future when he said, "I was asked by ITV last week to present the Celtic game", he said
 "A few weeks before that i was asked to present United's game against Celtic at Old Trafford
 main samajhataa hum ki main yah kaam pehle ek baar ski ke liye kar chukaa hum

 Keen, who would often take turns to turn triggs, then regularly went to the Bleeding Wolf pub and met reporters there on the night of David Beckham's wedding
 Asked why he had not gone to the wedding, he joked: "there was a choice between marriage and the wolf - and the wolf prevailed
" keen ek thik ho rahaa sharaabi he
