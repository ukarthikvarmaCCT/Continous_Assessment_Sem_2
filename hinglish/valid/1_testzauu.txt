 The long-run Phillips curve is now seen naturally as the lower-standing line of inflation
 There is no effect on unemployment where the unemployment rate is accordingly
 The Phillips curve is now more based on the velocity of the measure of money supply
 With the unemployment rate, by the precise prophets, is seen as very simple
 is tarah ke rup main em ze em veg, alpavadhi main berogari se prabhavit he jo, lekin lambey samay tak nahin
 History The rate of wage wage revision against unemployment, United Kingdom Phillips from 1913–1948 wiliam philips, ek newjiland kaa janm arthshaastri, 1958 main ek kaagaj berogari or tremasik patrika aarthika main prakashit kiya gaya tha 1861-1957 united kingdom main paisa mazdooree kii daron main parivartan kii dar, ke bich sambandh kaa sheershak likhaa tha
 The paper describes how there is an inverse relationship between observed money pay and unemployment changes in the British economy over the period of Phillips's investigation
 anya deshon main paaya isi pattern the or 1960 main paul samuelson or robert solo 'philips kaam liya or mahangaai or berogari ke bich kii kadi spasht kiya: mudrasphiti ucch tha, jab berogari kam tha, or iske vipareet
 In the 1920s, an American economist Irving Fisher Phillips noted this kind of curve relationship
 haalanki, philips 'mul vakr paise mazdooree ke vyavhaar ko varnit kiya
 Stagflation 1970 ke dashak main kai desho mahangaai or berogari donon bhi mudrasphitijanit mandi ke rup main janaa jaataa he ke ucch str kaa anubhav kiya
 Principles based on the Phillips curve suggest that this may not happen, and beef the curve under a concerted attack from a group of economists headed by Milton Freedman
 fridman philips vakr sambandh keval ek kam ran kii ghatana thi
 This could be due to Samuelson shifting in a certain way and as Solo argued 8 years ago, in the long run, employees and employers contracted anticipated inflation that resulted in an increase in employment in pay rates, Will take inflation into account, argued that unemployment would then start to rise back to its previous level with higher inflation rates

 The theory goes under several names, with some changes to its description, but all modern versions distinguish between short run and long run effect on unemployment
 mudrasphiti kii apekshaaon vruddhi, edmund felps or milton fridman ne tark diya ki jab yah upar main badlaav ke baad se "kam ran philips vakr" iske alaava, "ummiido-sanvardhit philips vakr" kaha jaataa he
 In the long run, it turns out that monetary policy cannot affect unemployment, which also adjusts back to its "natural rate", called "narrows" or "long-run Phillips curve"

 He was indicted on July 22, 1999 for the murder of Curzon Wyllie
 madan laal dhingra ne adaalat main khule shabdon main kaha ki "mujhe garv he ki main apana jivan samarpit kar rahaa hum
 "this incident is one of the first events of the Indian independence movement in the twentieth century
 madanlaal dhingada kaa janm 18 sitambar san 1883 ko punjab praant ke ek sampann hindu parivaar main hua tha
 His father Dittamal ji was a civil surgeon and was completely dyed in English color, but Mataji was a very religious and full of Indian rite woman
 unka parivaar angrejon kaa vishwaasapaatr tha or jab madanlaal ko bhartiya swatantrata sambandhi kranti ke aarope main lahore ke ek kalege se nikaal diya gaya to parivaar ne madanlaal se naata tod liya

 In London, Dhingra came in contact with India's famous nationalist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and Shyamji Krishna Varma
 ve log dhingada kii prachand deshbhakti se bahut prabhavit hue
 It is believed that Savarkar made Madanlal a member of a revolutionary institution called Abhinav Bharat and gave training in weapons
 madanlaal dhingada india house main rahete the jo un dinon bhartiya vidhyaarthiyon ke rajnatik kriyakalapon kaa kendra hua karata tha
 These people were very angry at the death penalty given to revolutionaries like Khudiram Bose, Kanhai Lal Dutt, Satinder Pal and Kashi Ram at that time

 After that, Dhingra tried to shoot himself with his pistol but he was caught

 In a general sense, it is a unit made up of a set of all biological and abiotic elements, facts, processes and events that affect our lives
 yah hamaare chaaron ore vyaapt he or hamaare jivan kii prayek ghatana isi ke andar sampadit hoti he tathaa ham manushya apni samast kriyaaon se is paryaavaran ko bhi prabhavit karte hai
 Thus there is an interdependent relationship between an organism and its environment
 paryaavaran ke jaivik sanghatakon main sookshm jeevanu se lekar keede-makode, sabhi jeev-jantu or ped-paudhe aa jate hai or iske saath hi unase judi sari jaev kriyaayein or prakriyaayein bhi
 Abiotic components include lifeless elements and their associated processes, such as rocks, mountains, rivers, wind and climate elements
 saamanytah paryaavaran ko manushya ke sandarbh main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he or manushya ko ek alag ikai or uske chaaron ore vyaapt anya samast chizon ko uskaa paryaavaran ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 But it is also important to note that there are still many human civilizations on this earth, who do not consider themselves separate from the environment and in their view all nature is a single entity
 jiskaa manushya bhi ek hissaa he
 In fact, those who regard humans as separate from the environment are those who are technologically advanced and are able to change their natural conditions drastically by extensive use of science and technology
 maanav hastkshep ke aadhaar par paryaavaran ko do prakhandon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he - prakritik yaa naiysargik paryaavaran or maanav nirmit paryaavaran
 However, a completely natural environment or a completely man-made environment are nowhere to be found
 yah vibhaajan prakritik prakriyaaon or dashaon main maanav hastkshep kii maatra kii adhikta or nunata kaa dyotak maatr he
 In ecology and environmental geography, the term natural environment is also used for habitat

 Except for rural society, there is not much eagerness in metropolitan life

 Whereas, it is a very close question with the whole society
 jab tak iske prati logon main ek swaabhaavik lagaav paidaa nahin hota, paryaavaran sangrakshan ek dur kaa sapana hi bana rahegaa
 The environment is directly related to nature
 apane parivesh main ham tarah-tarah ke jeev-jantu, ped-paudhe tathaa anya sajiv-nirjeev vastuen pate hai
 They together create the environment

 But the need of the hour is that along with detailed study of environment, practical knowledge related to it should be emphasized
 aadhunik samaaj ko paryaavaran se sambandhit samasyaon kii shiksha vyapak str par di jaani chahie
 Also, knowledge of preventive measures to deal with it is also necessary
 aaj ke masini yug main ham aisi sthiti se guzar rahe hai
 Pollution stands before us to destroy the entire environment as a curse
 sampoorn vishwa ek gambheer chunauti ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 Although we have a shortage of environmental content, there is no shortage of reference material
 vastav main aaj paryaavaran se sambaddh uplabdh gyaan ko vyaavhaarik banane kii aavashyaktaa he taaki samasya ko janamanas sahaj rup se samaj sake
 In such an uneven situation, it is necessary for the society to realize its duty and responsibility
 is prakaar samaaj main paryaavaran ke prati jaagrukta paidaa kii ja sakati he
 In fact, the living and non-living two components together make up nature
 vaayu, jal tathaa bhoomi nirjeev ghatakon main aate hai jabaki jantu-jagat tathaa padap-jagat se milakar sajivon kaa nirmaan hota he
 An important relationship between these components is that they are interdependent for their sustenance
 jeev-jagat main yadhyapi maanav sabase adhik sachetan evam samvedansheel praani he tathaapi apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti hetu vah anya jeev-jantuon, padap, vaayu, jal tathaa bhoomi par nirbhar rahata he
 Animals, plants, air, water and land found in the environment of human form the environment
 shiksha ke madhyam se paryaavaran kaa gyanshiksha maanav-jivan ke bahumukhi vikaas kaa ek prabal saadhan he
 Its main purpose is to bring physical, mental, social, cultural and spiritual intelligence and maturity within the person
 shiksha ke uddeshyon kii purti hetu prakritik vaataavaran kaa gyaan ati aavashyak he
 The tradition of learning about the natural environment has been there since the beginning in Indian culture
 parantu aaj ke bhautikwaadi yug main paristhitiyaan bhinn hoti ja rahi hai
 While new innovations are happening in various fields of science and technology
 to duusari ore maanav parivesh bhi usee gati se prabhavit ho rahaa he
 It is necessary for the next generation to understand the changes happening in the environment through education
 paryaavaran tathaa shiksha ke antarsambandhon kaa gyaan hasil karke koi bhi vyakti is disha main anek mahatvapurn kaary kar saktaa he
 The environment is closely related to science, but there are no scientific intricacies in its education
 shikshaarthiyon ko prakruti tathaa paristhitik gyaan sidhi tathaa saral bhashaa main samajhaai jaani chahie
 Initially, this knowledge should only be in an introductory manner on the surface
 aage chalakar iske takneekee pahaluon par vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 Knowledge of environment in education is essential for human safety
 paryaavaran apni sampoornataa main ek ikai he jisamen ajaivik or jaivik sanghatak aapas main vibhinn antarkriyaaon dwaara sambhddha or antargumphit hote hai
 This feature gives it the appearance of an ecosystem because ecosystems or ecosystems are interconnected sets of all biological and abiotic elements in an area of the earth
 atah paryaavaran bhi ek paaritantr he
 The largest ecosystem biosphere is considered by scale on Earth
 jaevmandal prithvi kaa vah bhaag he jisamen jeevadharee paae jate hai or yah sthalmandal, jalmandal tathaa vayumandal main vyaapt he
 The entire earth environment is also composed of these units, so in this sense the global environment, biosphere and earth ecosystem become synonymous with each other
 mana jaataa he ki prithvi ke vayumandal kaa vartmaan sanghatan or isamen oxigen kii vartmaan maatra prithvi par jivan hone kaa kaaran hi nahin apitu parinaam bhi he
 Photosynthesis, which is a biological process, has been an important process affecting the formation of the Earth's atmosphere
 is prakaar ke chintan se judi vichaardhaara puri prithvi ko ek ikai gaaya yaa sajiv prithvi ke rup main dekhati he
 In the same way, the study of the effects of ecology on humans and the effects that humans exert on the environment is a major study point of human ecology and human geography
 * yah bhi dekhen: pradooshan or jalwaayu parivartan Most environmental problems are associated with environmental degradation and increased human population and human consumption of resources
 paryaavarniya avanayan ke antargat paryaavaran main hone vaale ve saare parivartan aate hai jo avaanchhneeya hai or kisi kshetra vishesh main yaa puri prithvi par jivan or sandharniyata ko khatra utpann karte hai
 Hence, pollution, climate change, loss of biodiversity and other natural disasters are included in this
 paryaavarniya avanayan ke saath milakar jansankhya main charghaatanki dar se ho rahi vruddhi tathaa maanav dwaara upbhog ke badalte praturup lagbhag sari paryaavarniya samasyaon ke mul kaaran hai
 Resource reduction means the exploitation of natural resources by humans for their economic benefit so fast that they cannot be replenished by natural processes
 vartmaan pariprekshya main sansaadhan ksharan ke liye jansankhya ke dabaav, tej vruddhi dar or logon ke upbhog praturup kaa bhi prabhaav jimmevaar mana ja rahaa he
 Resources are divided into two categories - renewable resources and non-renewable resources
 iske alawa kuch sansaadhan itani paryaapt maatra main uplabdh hai ki unka kshay nahin ho saktaa unhen akshay sansaadhan kehete hai jaise saura urja
 Rapid exploitation of non-renewable resources can end their storage and create difficult conditions for human life
 koyala, petroleum, yaa dhatvithak khanijon ke bhandaron kaa nirmaan ek deergh avadhi kii ghatana he or jis teji se manushya in kaa dohan kar rahaa he ye ek na ek din samaapt ho jaayenge
 On the other hand, some renewable resources are also being used by humans so fast that their natural processes are not possible to be replenished as fast and thus they will also fall under the category of non-renewable resources
 pradooshan athwa paryaavarniya pradooshan paryaavaran main kisi padaarth athwa urja ke pravesh ko kehete hai yadi isaki gati itani tej ho ki saamaanya or prakritik prakriyaaon dwaara iskaa parikshepan, mandan, viyojan, punarchakran athwa ahaanikaarak rup main sangrakshan na ho sake
 Thus there are two clear indicators of pollution, the entry of any substance or energy into the environment and its being harmful or unwanted to the natural environment
 is tarah ke avaanchit tatv ko pradooshak yaa dooshak kehete hai
 Pollution is classified based on the type of pollutant, the source or the part of the ecosystem in which it enters
 udhaaharan ke taur par vaayu pradooshan, jal pradooshan, mrudaa pradooshan, ityadi prakaar is aadhaar par nishchit kiye jate hai ki paaritantr ke is hisse main dooshak tatv kaa pravesh hota he
 On the other hand, types of radioactive pollution, light pollution, noise or noise pollution etc
 are classification based on their own type of pollutant
 === jalwaayu parivartan ===hamaare jivan me hamane bahut saare parivartan dekhe he jal vaayu parivartan unhi me se ek he jal vaayu parivartan ke kaaran hi prithvi par mausam parivartan hota he mausam se hame bahut laabh ho ta he mosum ke bina koi fasal nahi ugaai ja sakati evam naa hi manushya jivan ek mausam me guzaar saktaa he samast jeev dhari ko ko mausam kii jarurat hoti he jalwaayu parivartan se hame laabh bhi he to nuksaan bhi kyonki These include cyclones, strong storms, excessive rain, drought etc
 paryaavaran prabandhan kaa taatpary paryaavaran ke prabandhan se nahin he, balki aadhunik maanav samaaj ke paryaavaran ke saath sampark tathaa us par padane vaale prabhaav ke prabandhan se he
 The three major issues affecting managers are politics, programs and resources
 paryaavaran prabandhan kii aavashyaktaa ko kai drushtikonon se dekha ja saktaa he
 Environment is given special importance in Indian culture
 pracheen kaal se hi bhartiya samskruti main paryaavaran ke anek ghatakon jaise vrikshon ko poojya maanakar unhen puja jaataa he
 Peepal tree is considered sacred
 vat ke vriksh kii bhi puja hoti he
 They are also worshiped as water, air, fire and god
 samudr, nadi ko bhi pujan karne yogya mana gaya he
 Rivers like Ganga, Indus, Saraswati, Yamuna, Godavari, Narmada are worshiped as sacred
 dharti ko bhi mata kaa darja diya gaya he
 Since ancient times, various forms of environment are worshiped in India
 paryaavarniya vidhi athwa paryaavaran vidhi samekit rup se un sabhi antarrashtriya, rashtriya athwa kshetreey sandhiyon, samjhauton or sanvaidhanik vidhiyon ko kaha jaataa he jo prakritik paryaavaran par maanav prabhaav ko kam karne or paryaavaran kii sandharniyata banaaye rakhane hetu hai
 The environmental law in India is regulated by the Environment Act 1986 which is a comprehensive legislation

 He was the son of Ghatotkacha and Ahilavati
 barbaric ko unki maan ne yahi sikhaaya tha ki hameshaa haarane vaale kii taraf se ladanaa or ve isi siddhant par ladate bhi rahe
 Barbarik had such attainments, with the help of which, in the blink of an eye, he could kill all the heroes who participated in the war of Mahabharata
 jab ve yuddh main sahaayta dene aaye, tab inaki shakti kaa parichay praapt kar shrikrishna ne apni kootneeti se inhen ranchandi ko bali chadha diya
 His desire to see war till the end of Mahabharata war was fulfilled by the blessing of Shri Krishna and his beheaded man kept watching the war till the end and continued to veer
 kuch kahaniyon ke anusaar barbaric ek yaksha the, jinka punarjanm ek insaan ke rup main hua tha
 Barbarik Gadadhari was the grandson of Bhimsen and the son of Ghatotkacha

 He learned martial arts from his mother

 Ishapurtik Valmiki was pleased and provided him with a bow, which was able to make him victorious in all the three worlds

 When he reached to receive blessings from his mother, the mother pledged to support the loser

 Omnipresent Sri Krishna disguised himself as a Brahmin to prevent him from becoming acquainted with Barbarik and even smiled at him knowing that he had come to join the war with just three arrows
 aisa sunne par barbaric ne uttar diya ki maatr ek baan shatru sena ko parrast karne ke liye paryaapt he or aisa karne ke baad baan waapas tarkas main hi aayega
 If the three arrows are used, there will be a cry in all three worlds
 is par shrikrishna ne unhen chunauti di ki is pipal ke ped ke sabhi patron ko chhedakar dikhalaao, jiske neeche dono khadey the
 Barbarik accepted the challenge and took out an arrow from his tunir and remembered God and drove the arrow towards the leaves of the tree
 tir ne kshan bhar main ped ke sabhi patton ko bhed diya or shrikrishna ke pair ke ird-gird chakkar lagane laga, kyonki ek patta unhone apane pair ke neeche chupa liya tha, barbaric ne kaha ki aap apane pair ko hataa lijie varanaa ye aapke pair ko chot pahunchaa degaa
 Sri Krishna asked the child Barbarik from which side he would join the war, then Barbarik repeated the promise given to his mother that he would participate in the war from the side whose army was weak and headed for defeat
 shrikrishna jaanate the ki yuddh main haar to kauravon kii hi nishchit he or is par agar barbaric ne unka saath diya to parinaam unke paksh main hi hoga
 In a Brahmin disguise, Shri Krishna expressed his desire to donate to the child, on which Veer Barbarik promised him that if he would be able to fulfill his desire, he would definitely do it
 shrikrishna ne unase sheesh kaa daan maanga
 The child Barbaric was shocked for a moment, but he expressed the firmness of his word
 balak barbaric ne brahman se apane vaastivak rup se avgat karaane kii prarthana kii or shrikrishna ke bare main sunakar balak ne unke viraat rup ke darshan kii abhilaashaa vyakt kii, shrikrishna ne unhen apana viraat rup dikhaaya
 He explained to Barbaric that the battle ground worship required the donation of a heroic Kshatriya's head before the war began, he decorated Barbaric with the title of most valiant in battle, so he asked for his head in charity
 barbaric ne unase prarthana kii ki vah ant tak yuddh dekhnaa chahta he, shrikrishna ne unki yah baat sweekaar kar lee
 On the day of Falgun, he donated his head
 unka sir yubhumi ke sameep hi ek pahari par sushobhit kiya gaya, jahaan se barbaric sampoorn yuddh kaa jayja le sakate the
 At the end of the war, there was a mutual debate among the Pandavas as to who goes to the credit of victory in the war, on which Shri Krishna suggested to them that Barbarik's head is a witness to the whole war, so who could be better decisive than that? Everyone agreed to this
 barbaric ke sheesh ne uttar diya ki shrikrishna hi yuddh main vijay praapt karaane main sabase mahaan kaary kiya he
 His education, his presence, his war strategy were decisive
 unhen yubhumi main sirf unka sudarshan chakra ghumta hua dikhaayi de rahaa tha jo ki shatru sena ko kaat rahaa tha

 apwaad sanchaalan ek programing bhashaa sanrachana yaa computor hardware yantrawali he jise ghatane vaale apwaadon, ek vishesh avasthaa jo program karyanvayan kii saamaanya gati ko badal detii he, ke sanchaalan ke liye dijin kiya gaya he
 Programming languages differ greatly in their support of exception handling
 Functions can return 0 fruits for any input that cannot be placed in a valid value
 In such languages the programmer should either check the mistake or input validation
 vah degree jiske liye aisi nishchit manyata or bhul jaanch jaruri he, vah ek die hue programing parivesh dwaara pradat apwaad sanchaalan sahaayta ke vipareet hoti he
 The hardware exception operation is somewhat different from the support provided by software tools, but the same hypothesis and term prevail for them
 saamaanya taur par apwaad ko ek purvanirdhaarit jagah main nishpaadan kii vartmaan avasthaa ko bachaate hue tathaa apwaad sanchaalak naamak ek nishchit sabaroutine ke liye nishpaadan kaa swichan kar ke prabandhit kiya jaataa he
 This depends on the situation, that later the operator resumes execution at the original location using secure information
 For example, a page fault usually allows the program to restart, while a division by zero may not be resolvable transparently
 prasanskaran ke vichaar se, hardware vyavdhaan phir se shuru karne yogya apwaadon ke saamaan hai, halanki ve prayogkarta ke program flo se vishisht rup se jude nahin hai
 The exception of the routine writer's idea that an exception is a useful means of indicating that a routine cannot function normally
 For example, when an input argument is invalid or a resource upon which it relies is not available
 In systems without exception, routines require that they return some specific routine code error
 However, this is sometimes compounded by a semiquantitative problem, in which the user of the routine needs to write additional code to separate the illusory value from the normal return value
 java yaa NET jaise routine ingine pariveshon main, aise aujaar maujuud rahete hai jo routine se jude hote hai or har samay jo ruchi ke apwaad paidaa hote hai, ve un chuphi hui soochnaaon ko darj karte hai jo apwaad ke phenke jane ke samay smriti main maujuud rahati he 
 in upkarnon ko swachaalit apwaad sanchaalan yaa bhul rokanevaala aujaar kaha jaataa he or ye apwaadon ke "mukhya kaaran" kii soochna dete hai
 Contemporary applications face a variety of design challenges when considering exception handling strategies
 vishesh rup se aadhunik udhyam str ke anuprayogon main apwaadon ko prakriya kii simaaon or mashin kii simaaon ko paar kar lenaa chahie
 Recognizing that a process fails at a point where it cannot be easily handled by the software part of the process is part of the design of a concrete exception handling strategy
 code ke ek tukade ko apwaad-surakshit kaha jaataa he, yadi code ke andar ran-tim asafalataa samruti rahasyodghatan, jamaa akda aspashtataa, yaa amaanya parinaam jaise kharaab prabhaav paidaa nahin karti
 apwaad-suraksha code ko code me rakhe gaye invariants ko santusht karnaa chahie, bhale hi apwaad ghatit hon
 apwaad suraksha ke kai str hai: For example, consider a smart vector type such as c ++ 's std :: vector or Java arrow list
 jab ek item x ko vector v se joda jaataa he to vector ko chahie ki vah x ko vastu ke internet suchi se jode or us ginati kshetra ko apadet kare jo bataati he ki v main kitne padaarth hai
 New memory may also need to be allocated if the capacity present is not large enough
 yah smriti aavanton vifal ho saktaa he or ek apwaad ko paidaa karata he
 Because of this, a vector that provides failed transparency is very difficult or impossible to write
 haalanki, vector kaaphi had tak ek majboot apwaad guarantee aasaani se de saktaa he, is maamle main, v kaa x main pravesh karnaa yaa to safal ho saktaa he yaa v aparivartit rahata he
 If the vector only provides the basic exception security guarantee, if interpolation is unsuccessful, it may or may not hold vx, but it will at least remain in the same state
 However, if the vector only gives the minimum guarantee, it is possible that the vector becomes invalid
 For example, perhaps the field size of v was increased but x was not actually entered, making the condition inconsistent
 beshak, bina guarantee ke, program durghatnagrast ho saktaa he; shaayad vector ke vistaar kii jarurat thi lekin vah smriti ko abantit nahin kar sakaa or amaanya pate par smriti kaa sparsh karte hue aage ke kshetra kii andhadhundh khudaai kar di maano aabantan safal ho gaya ho
 At least basic exception protection is usually required
 vifal paardarshita ko lagu karnaa kathin he or aamtaur par pustakaalayon main yah sambhav nahin he, jahaan upyog kii puri jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 The exception handling routine is intended to ensure that the code can handle the event of an error
 apwaad sanchaalan ko sthapit karne ke liye rutinon ko paryaapt rup se majboot banaaya jaataa he, amaanya yaa apratyaashit input ke ek vyapak spectrum yukt code ko prastut karne ki liye yah aavashyak he, jaise ki ise utparivartan pareekshan or vaaya soptware folt injection ke dwaara taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he 
 sabase adhik mushkil softwaron main ek protocol software he, jisamen apwaad sanchaalan routine ko likhaa jaataa he, chunki ek majboot protocol karyanvayan input ko praapt karne ke liye banaaya janaa chahie jo adhyatan visheshta ko nahin maanata he
 To ensure that a full meaningful regression analysis of a software development lifecycle process can be performed, any exception operation checks must be fully automated and test cases must be produced in scientific, repeatable behavior
 There are many commercial systems that do this kind of testing
 kai computer bhashaaen jaise, ection script, edie, bleetjamax, C++, D, ECMA lipi, effel, java, emel, object pascal objective-c Ocaml, PL / 1, prolog, pithon, rial basic, rubi, drishy pralog tathaa adhiktar net bhashaaen apwaad evam apwaad sanchaalan kii sahaayta ke liye bani hai
 In those languages, an exception exception occurs through the stack of call functions until the exception operator receives the search back, inviting some languages to open the stack as the search progresses
 That is, if function f holds an operator h for exception E, calls function g, calls function g, which in turn calls function h and an exception e occurs in h , Then the function h and g can be finished, f in h will handle E
 aam lisp apwaad sanchaalak ko kol karata he or stack ko kholta nahin he
 This allows the computation to continue exactly where the error occurred
 Stackless implementation of Mithril helps stable-time exception operations without opening the stack
 maamuli vaakyatmak matbhedon ko chhodkar, keval do apwaad sanchaalan vidhiyaan upyog main hai sabase lokapriy vidhi main, ek apwaad kii shuruuaat ek apwaad padaarth, yaa ek vishesh badhaane yogya gine hue tip ke mulya ke saath ek vishesh kathan ke dwaara kii jaati he
 The scope begins with a marker clause for exception operators and ends at the beginning of the first operator clause
 kai sanchaalak cloj or us apwaad tip kaa jise sanchalit karte hai, kaa paalan karte hai or apwaad padaarth ke liye jis naam kaa ve prayog karte he, uskaa vistrut vivaran dete hai
 Some languages also permit clauses that are used in the event that no exception occurs before the operator accesses the scope
 ek sambandhit cloj adhik saamaanya he jiskaa nishpaadan aam taur par body ke apwaad-sanchaalan block ke andar adhigrahan kiye gaye sansadhano ko relies karne ke liye kiya jaataa he chaahe ek apwaad ghatit ho yaa nahi

 In its completeness, the exception handling code might look like this: ) ) Hold, restoring the invariant while stabilizing the object's position
 yahan effil vaakyavinyas main vyakt ek udhaaharan he
 This assures that the fast_ send routine is generally a better way to send messages, but when an exception is initiated, it may fail; If this happens then the algorithm then uses slow_ send, which usually fails

 yadi yah dhimaa_bhejein kaa nishpaadan vifal rahata he, to bachaav cloj no intry ke saath ant tak bachaav karegaa, puure routine nishpaadan ko vifal karte hue
 This approach is credited with clearly defining what is "normal" and "unusual": a common case that produces execution is one whose agreement the routine does not fulfill

 Java designers plan for checked exceptions, which are special exceptions
 jaanch apwaad jo ek paddati uthaa sakati he, ve paddati ke hastakshar kaa hissaa hote hai
 For example, if a method can throw an I0 exception, it should declare this fact in its method signature
 yah kar paane main vifaltaa ek sankalan samay truti ko janm detaa he
 This exception is associated with investigators who exist at least for ocaml
 ocaml ke liye bahari upkaran paardarshee or vaikalpik donon hote hai
 The Clu programming language had a feature with interfaces, similar to what Java later started
 ek prakaarya apane tip main ullikhit apwaadon ko hi paidaa kar saktaa he lekin kol kiya hua koi bhi li ho rahaa apwaad apane aap sol rantime apwaad, vifal, main badal jayega, sankalan-samay truti main parinaam bataane ke baavjood
 baad ke, modula-3 main samaan suvidha thi
 These features do not include compile-time probes that are central to the probed exception hypothesis and are not incorporated into any programming language other than Java
 C++ programing bhashaa jaanch kiye hue apwaadon ke liye ek vaikalpik vyavastha karti he jise apwaad vinirdesh kaha jaataa he
 By default any function can throw exceptions, but this can be limited by the throw clause added to the function signature, which specifies which exception to throw
 Exception specifications are not enforced forcefully at compile time
 Violation results in global function being called STD: Unexpected
 ek khaali apwaad vinirdesh diya ja saktaa he jo ingit karata he ki prakaarya koi apwaad thro nahin karenge
 It was not defaulted when associating exception operations with the language because existing code would require a lot of improvement, it would be a hindrance in interacting with code written in other languages, and locally it would be a lot of operators Attracts programmers to writing
 The explicit use of empty exception specifications, however, may allow c ++ compilers to perform optimizations to critical code and stack layouts that have to be suppressed when exception operations occur in a function
 kuch vishleshkon kii raay he ki C++ main apwaad vinirdeshon ke samuchit upyog ko hasil karnaa mushkil he
 In the upcoming c ++ language standard, the use of the standard exception specification specified in the current version is denied
 jaanche hue apwaad, sanchit samay par, ek die hue upyog main rantime par asanchalit apwaad sarfacing kii ghatana ko kam kar dete hai; jabaki bine jaanche hue apwaad asanchalit rah jate hai
 However, tested exceptions need to either express comprehensive throw announcements, convey implementation details and reduce encapsulation, or promote unhealthy-considered TRAI / catch interruptions that originate exceptions from their proper operators
 Can hide
 ek viksit ho rahe koderdhar kaa vichaar samay ke aadhaar par karen
 An interface may be declared to throw x and y exceptions
 code ko baad vaale sanskaran main, yadi koi z apwaad thro karnaa chahta he, to yah pehle ke upyog ke vipareet ek nayaa code banayega
 iske alaava, anukulak vidhi ke anusaar, jahaan code kii ek body ek interphes kii ghoshnaa karti he jo us samay ek alag code kii body dwaara karyanvit kii jaati he isliye ki code ko lagaaya ja sake or pratham ke dwaara kol kiya jo sake, anukulak code ke paas samasyaon kii vyakhya ke liye ek samrudh apwaad dasta ho saktaa he, lekin ghoshit interphes apwaad tip kaa upyog ke liye ise majaboor kiya jaataa he
 The number of declared exceptions can be reduced by either declaring a superclass of all the exceptions thrown efficiently, or by defining and declaring those exception types, mapping the summation level of the said method and the lower level of these types
 , Exceptions are especially appropriate for the cover use of ejaculation, especially to protect the root cause
 iske alaava, yah bahut sambhav he ki parivartansheel interphes ke uparyukt udhaaharan main colling code ke sudhaar kii bhi jarurat hoti he, chunki kuch mat ke anusaar ek vidhi ke dwaara thro kiye ja sakane vaale apwaad kaise bhi us vidhi ke nihit interphes kaa hissaa hote hai
 At least the use of throw exception declaration or catch is sufficient to satisfy the check
 jabaki iskaa kuch upyog ho saktaa he, lekin yah anivaary rup se jaanch kiye hue apwaad tantra main gatirodh utpann karata he
 Additionally, the throw exception forces all calling codes to do so
 aniyantrit apwaad tip ko, soch vichaar ke saath, avasar ke bahari str ko chhodkar sanchalit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 ye aksar: un paridrishyon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai jo pun: usee haalat main aane kii anumati nahin dete: rantiupwaad baar baar programing dosha ko pratibimbit karte hai, or trutiyaan aam taur par thik na kiye jane vaali jeviem vifaltaaon kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 The view is that there are cases in the language supporting that tested exceptions where the use of tested exceptions is not correct
 tulykaalik apwaad jaanche hue apwaadon kii avadharana ke saath kuch-kuch sambandhit he
 Synchronous exceptions occur in a particular program statement, in such an instance synchronous exceptions can appear anywhere in practice
 aisa lagata he ki sankalkon dwaara atulykaalik apwaad sanchaalan kii jarurat nahin pad sakati
 unke saath program bananaa bhi mushkil he
 Naturally examples of asynchronous events include pressing ctrl-c to stop a program and receiving signals such as "stop" or "cancel" from other execution threads
 vishesh rup se programing bhashaaen atulykaalikta ko simit karne ke dwaara isse pesh aati hai, udhaaharan ke liye java ne thrid ko rokna or dubaara shuru karne ko kho diya he
 Instead there may be quasi asynchronous exceptions that occur only synchronously or in the appropriate locations of the program
 comone lisp, dialan tathaa smalltock ke paas avasthaa pranali he jisamen uparyukt apwaad sanchaalan pranali shaamil hai
 The arrival of a state in those languages or environments indicates a function and only the delay of exception handlers can be decided to open the stack
 avasthaaen apwaadon kaa samanyikaran hoti hai
 When a condition arises, an appropriate state operator is searched and in the stack order, it is selected to operate the condition
 avasthaaen jo trutiyon kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karatin, ve puure taur par surakshit rup se asanchalit hi rah sakati hai, unka ek maatr uddeshy upyogkarta kii ore sanket yaa chetavanee ko bhejnaa ho saktaa he
 This relates to the recapture model of so-called exception handling, in which some exceptions are allegedly persisted: allowed to return to an expression that signals the exception after a corrective action in the operator
 avasthaa pranali ke is prakaar samanyikrut kiya jaataa he: ek agambhir avasthaa ke antargat, purvaparibhaashit ristart vinduon tak chalaang lagaana sambhav hota he, jo sanketan abhivyakti or avasthaa sanchaalkon ke bich upasthit rahati hai
 Restarts are functions that are close to some thesaurus environment, allowing the programmer to repair this environment before completely ejecting the phase handlers or partially opening the stack
 avasthaa sanchaalan niti se yantrawali ko algaav pradaan karata he
 Restarts provide various possible mechanisms to correct errors, but do not choose which mechanism is appropriate for the given situation
 This is the field of operation of a stage operator, which has wide reach
 ek udhaaharan: maan lijie ek pustkaalay prakaarya he jiskaa uddeshy ek ekal sislog file pravishti ko nirdesh dena he
 What should this function do if the entry gets distorted

 In an interactive log file browser, the right thing to do may be to return the entry without a phrase, so that the user can see it - but the right thing to do in an automated log-summarizing program is to have zero values for unreadable fields Supplied, but failed with an error if too many entries are distorted

 And then the search started of such people who could collect geographical information there
 And finally in 1863, Captain Mountgumery got two such people
