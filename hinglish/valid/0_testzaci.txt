 Therefore it is clear from these experiments that the charge of these particles will be inverted

 Four years before Positron's experimental invention, Dirac gave an equation that described all the known properties of the electron, but it was also necessary to assume a particle whose covariance and energy were negative
 yah baat ajeeb thi
 To avoid this undesirable situation, Dirac proposed that generally all states of negative energy are filled with electrons
 at: ham dhanatmak urja kii avasthaaon ko hi dekh pate hai
 But sometimes when strong, interactions occur by the electromagnetic field, an electron comes out of the states of negative energy and comes out and behaves like a positive energy electron

 We can illustrate this with a hole in a sea of negative energy

 These genetic material contains the basic 'instructions' on how to produce identical copies of such viruses and how to steal the food's organs or devices used for production in the fooder's body and the virus's needs
 To be completed
 Feeding cells will follow these instructions and produce more copies of the virus, so that more and more cells will be infected
 Some types of viruses physically put their genes in the feeding genome
 As long as the cell is alive, the gene of the virus is also included in its gene
 doctoron or anvik jeev vigyaniyon ne ehsaas kiya he ki is tarah ke virus maanav koshika main achche jin ke vaahak ke taur par prayog kiye ja sakate hai

 An example: ek aisa virus paaya gaya he, jo bhojandaayee kii koshika ke jinom main apane jin kaa pravesh karaata he or uske baad apni pratiyaan utpaadit karata he
 The virus has two genes - a and B
 The a gene encapsulates a protein that allows the virus to enter the host's genome
 jin bi us rog kaa kaaran he jisase yah vishaanu juda he
 Gene c is the "normal" or "desired" gene that we want in place of gene B
 is tarah virus kii aisi ejineering karke jisase jin bi, jin si dwaara pratisthapit ho jaae or jin e sahi dhang se kaam karata rahe, jin si ko bhojandaayee kii koshika main is tarah daalaa ja saktaa he kii koi beemaari utpann naa ho
 All of this is clearly a highly generalized form and there are many problems that prevent the use of viral carriers in gene therapy, such as the hassle of preventing unwanted effects, ensuring that the virus will infect the right target cell in the body And ensuring that the inserted will not inhibit any important genes already present in the genome
 Not quite promising

 jab ek retrovyrus ek bhojandaayee koshika ko sankraman karata he, to yah apane arene ko kuch anya anzimon ke saath bhojandaayee kii koshika main chodta he, ye anzime hai- reverse transcriptes or integres
bhojandaayee koshika kii anuvaanshik saamagree main judane se pehle zaruri he kii retrovyrus ke arene anu apane arene anu se diene kii ek nakal banaaen jo bhojandaayee koshika kii anuvaanshik saamagree main jud sake
 ek arene anu se diene kii ek nakal banane kii prakriya ko vipareet pratilekhan kaha gaya he
 This is done by one of the enzymes found inside a virus, called reverse transcriptase
 jab ye diene prati ban jaati he or bhojandai koshika ke kendrak main mukt rup se pai jaati he to zaruri he ki ye bhojandai koshika ke jinom main shaamil ho jaae
 iskaa matlab he ki yah koshika ke bade diene anu main pravesh kare
yah prakriya virus main paae jane vaale ek dusre anzime dwaara kii jaati he jise integres kaha jaataa he
 Now according to the genetic material of the virus, it can be said that the food cell has now been modified to contain a new gene
 yadi yah bhojandai koshika baad main vibhajit hoti he, to uske vansh main sabhi nai koshikaayen nae jin ko dhaaran karengi, kabhi kabhi retrovyrus ke jin unki jaankaree turant vyakt nahin karte
 One problem with the use of retroviruses in gene therapy is that the integrase enzyme can enter arbitrary any position in the virus genome present in the genome of the feeding cell - and it can randomly convert genetic material into a chromosome
 yadi anuvanshik saamagree bhojandai koshika ke mul jeenon main se ek ke bich main pravesh kare to yah jin baadhit ho jayega 
 yadi yah wo jin he jo koshika vibhaajan ko niyantrit karata he to iske baadhit hone se koshika vibhaajan aniyantrit ho saktaa he

 Treatment of severe immune deficiency with linked links using retroviral carriers is one of the most successful gene therapy experiments to date, treating more than twenty patients in France and the UK and rapidly restructuring the immune system
 It has been observed that similar tests were banned in the United States when treating blood cancer in French patients
 For X-SCID gene therapy trial

 When these viruses infect a host cell, they introduce their DNA molecule into the host
 When these viruses infect a food cell, they make their DNA molecule enter the food cell

 This carrier system has been promoted for the treatment of cancer and in fact it is the first gene therapy product licensed to treat cancer, Gandicin is an adenovirus

 Since then, the use of adenovirus carriers has emphasized genetically crippled forms of the virus
 parvovyrus parivaar ke,adino se jude virus ekal diene ke jinom vaale chote virus hai
 Wild-type AAV can penetrate genetic material at a specific location on the 19th chromosome with 100 percent certainty
 lekin ricombinant eevi jisamen koi bhi virus jin nahin hota balki sirf upachaaratmak jin hota he, vah jinom main ekikrut nahin hota
 iske bajaay iske siron par punah sanyojak viral jinom ai tii aar punh sangyojan ke zariye vrittakar sanrachanaayen episom banaata he, jinhen dirghakaalik jin abhivyakti kaa praathmik kaaran mana jaataa he
 There are also some drawbacks in the use of AAV, which includes that it contains only a small amount of DNA and is very difficult to produce
 phir bhi is prakaar ke virus kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, kyonki yah gaiyr rogajanak he
 
 Unlike adenoviruses, most people receiving AAV therapy do not make any attempts to remove the virus and the cells that have been successfully cured as an immune response
 Several trials with AV are underway or are under preparation, Are trying to treat diseases mainly in the eye and muscles, ie those two tissues where the virus is specifically It is useful to be
 haalaanki, naidanik pareekshan vahaan bhi shuru kiye gaye hai jahaan eevi vaahak mastishk ko jin pradaan karne ke kiye prayog kiye jate hai
 This is possible because AAV viruses can infect cells that are not dividing, such as neurons in which their genomes are expressed for a long time
 upar varnit virus vaahakon ke paas aisi prakritik bhojandaayee koshika jansankhya hoti he jise ki ve sabase adhik kushalta se sankramit kar sakate he
 The natural feeding cells of retroviruses are limited to a range and although adenoviruses and adeno-virus-associated viruses can efficiently infect a relatively broad range of cells, there are some cell types that are also refractory to infection with these viruses
 Huh
 ek komal koshika se judana yaa usamen pravesh karne main virus kii sataha par lage protein anvelop dwaara sahaayta milti he
 Retroviruses and adeno-associated viruses have a single layer of protein on their membranes, while the surface of the adenovirus has both an envelope protein and a membrane that extends away from the virus surface
 in sabhi virason main se prayek main anvelop proteinaavaran yaa anvelop protein koshika sataha anuon jaise kii hiparin sulphate se jude hote hai, jo kii unhen unke sakasham bhojandaayee ke paas le jaataa he or saath hi unpar protein graahak bhi hote hai jo yaa to virus ke protein main pravesh karne main protsaahan dene vaali sanrachana ko prerit karte hai yaa virus ke endosomachell-surface moleculescell-surface moleculeskosika-sataha anu ko vahaan pahunchaate hai jahaan avkashika kii amlata virus ke kot ko dobaaraa mudane yani rifolding ke liye prerit karti he
 In both cases, entry into the potentially host cell requires a favorable interaction between the proteins found on the surface of the virus and the proteins on the surface of the host cell
 jin chikitsa ke prayojanon ke liye, ye vaanchit ho saktaa he ki ek jin chikitsa vaahak dwaara grahniya koshikaon kii seemaa badhaai jaae

 Such a chimera contains the portion of the virus's protein that is required to be involved in virions, as well as the sequence required to interact with the proteins of a particular host cell
 aise virus jinamein is tarah ke invelap protein paristhiti kar die jate hai unhen chhadam virus virus kaha jaataa he udhaaharan ke liye, sabase janaa mana retro virus jo kii jin chikitsa ke pareekshan hetu kargar mana jaataa he lenti virus simian pratiraksha abhaav virus he jo kii fafoledaar mukhpaak virus yaa vesicular stomatytis virus se milane vaale ji protein naamak anvelop protein ke aavaran main hota he
 This carrier is known as VSVG pseudo lentivirus and infects almost all cells

 xxrep 4 = lypoplaxes or poliplaxes To improve the distribution of new DNA in the cell, the DNA must be protected from any damage and its entry into the cell should be convenient
 For this, new molecules are made of lipoplexes and polyplexes, which have the ability to process transfection
 Protect DNA from undesirable decay
 plasmid diene missel yaa ek lyposom ek sangathit dhaanche kii tarah lipid ke aavaran main rah saktaa he
 When this organized structure is mixed with DNA, it is called liposome
 lipid teen prakaar ke hote hai, rinatmak, udasin, yaa dhanayanit 
 shuru main, sanshleshit vaahakon ke liye lypoplaxes ke nirmaan main rinatmak or udasin lipid kaa prayog hota tha
 But later, despite the fact that they have very little toxicity, they are compatible with bodily fluids and are likely to adapt to tissue specificity; Because they are complex and take too much time, attention was shifted to cationic forms to create lipoplexes
 apane sakaaratmak aavesh ke kaaran dhanayanit lipid kaa prayog pehle rinatmak diene anu ko sanghanit karne main hota tha, taaki unki di en e ek capsule kaa rup lekar lyposom ban jaae
 baad main yah paaya gaya ki dhanayanit lipid lypoplaxes kii sthirataa ko kaaphi baadha dete hai
 In addition, due to their charge, cationic lipids interact with cell membranes, it was widely believed that endocytosis is the main route by the cell to take liposomes
 endocytosis ke parinamswarup endosom banate hai, lekin yadi jin indo som kii jhilli todakar koshika dravya main choda nahin ja saktaa, to unhen lisosom main bhej diya jayega jahaan unka kaary puraa karne se pehle sabhi diene nasht kar die jaayenge
yah bhi paaya gaya ki yadhyapi dhanayanit lipid swayan hi capsule rupi di en e ko sanghanit karke lyposom main badal sakate hai, lekin unki para sankraman prabhaavashiltaa bahut kam he kyonki endosomiy nistaar ke maamle main unki kshamta bahut kam he
 However, when adjuvant lipids were added to form lipoplexes, far more transfection effectiveness was observed
 baad main yah pataa laga ki kuch lipidon main ye kshamta he ki wo endosom kii jhilli ko visthirikrut kar sakate he taaki diene endosom se batch sake, isiilie un lipidon ko fujogenic lipid kaha jaataa he
 Although cationic liposomes are widely used as an alternative to gene delivery carriers or gene delivery vectors, they have also been found to have only toxicity, limiting their therapeutic use
 lypoplaxes kaa sabase aam prayog he jin koshika kaa cancer koshikaon main sthanantaran, jahaan aapurtit jin koshika main tumor shaman karanevaale niyantran jin ko sakriy kar detaa he or onkogenes kii sakriyata kam ho jaati he
 Recent studies have shown lipoplexes to be useful in infecting respiratory epithelial cells, so they may be used in the treatment of genetic respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis
 diene ke saath polimur ke jatil mishran ko poliplaxes kaha jaataa he
 Most polyplexes consist of cationic polymers and are produced as a result of ionic interactions
 poliplaxes or lypoplaxes ke kaary kii paddatiyon main ek bada antar ye he ki polyplaxes apane diene bhaar ko koshikadravya main mukt nahin kar sakate, atah iske liye indolytic abhikartaaon jaise ki adino virus ke saath sah parasankraman hona zaruri he
 However, this is not always the case, polymers such as polyethyl amine have their own ways of destroying indosomes, such as in ketosan and trimethylkytosan

 Other methods include other viral carriers mixed with cationic lipids or hybridized viruses

 Limitations of these competing reagents include the lack of ability to transfect multiple cell types, the lack of strong attack capability, incompatibility with animal specimens, and specificity
 Dendrimers provide strong co-additive formation and extreme control over molecule structure and therefore larger sizes

 kerala kii bhashaa malayalam he jo dravid parivaar kii bhashaaon main ek he
 Several theories have been presented about the origin of Malayalam language
 ek mat yah he ki bhugolic kaarnon se kisi aadi dravid bhashaa se malayalam ek swatantra bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui
 The second view to the contrary is that Malayalam is a language derived from Tamil
 ye donon prabal mat hai
 All scholars believe that Malayalam originated due to linguistic changes
 tamil, sanskrit donon bhashaaon ke saath malayalam kaa gaharaa sambandh he

 'ramcharitam' written in this period is considered to be the original poetry of Malayalam
 prarambh main tamrapatron, pattharon, tadpatron par malayalam kii gadhy kritiyaan lipibaddh huin
 Among them, the prose language is the main subject related to the property and money donation of individuals and temples and there are instructions related to administration

 iske liye aadhunik bhashavigyaan kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he jisane akshar, varna athwa swanim ko aadhaar banaaya he
 The sound which has an independent pronunciation is called 'syllable' or 'syllable'

 If correctly stated, the number of characters in English is 26 and the number of scripts is also 26
 malayalam main varnon or lipiyon ke bich koi sambandh nahin
 The relationship is between letters and scripts
 malayalam kii vishaal akshar sankhya ne lipi sudhaar ko kathit evam jatil banaaya
 The Malayalam letter numbers cannot be stated because they have distinctions at the phonemic level, which cannot be ruled out
