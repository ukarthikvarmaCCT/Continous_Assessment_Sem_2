 Therefore it is clear from these experiments that the charge of these particles will be inverted

 Four years before Positron's experimental invention, Dirac gave an equation that described all the known properties of the electron, but it was also necessary to assume a particle whose covariance and energy were negative
 yah baat ajeeb thi
 To avoid this undesirable situation, Dirac proposed that generally all states of negative energy are filled with electrons
 at: ham dhanatmak urja kii avasthaaon ko hi dekh pate hai
 But sometimes when strong, interactions occur by the electromagnetic field, an electron comes out of the states of negative energy and comes out and behaves like a positive energy electron

 We can illustrate this with a hole in a sea of negative energy

 The tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is being used primarily in public health programs
 tibi ke upachaar main antibiotic dawaaon kaa upyog karke bacteria ko maaraa jaataa he
 Effective TB treatment is difficult due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacteria cell wall, which inhibits the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective
 do sabase adhik istemaal kii jane vaali antibiotic dawaayein isoniyazid or riffampisin hai or upachaar, lambey samay kaa ho saktaa he jisame kai mahine lag sakate hai
 An antibiotic is commonly used in the treatment of latent TB, while a combination of several antibiotics is used in active TB disease to reduce the risk of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance

 All of this is clearly a highly generalized form and there are many problems that prevent the use of viral carriers in gene therapy, such as the hassle of preventing unwanted effects, ensuring that the virus will infect the right target cell in the body And ensuring that the inserted will not inhibit any important genes already present in the genome

 Retroviruses contain genetic material in the form of RNA molecules, while their feeder's genetic material is in the form of DNA
 jab ek retrovyrus ek bhojandaayee koshika ko sankraman karata he, to yah apane arene ko kuch anya anzimon ke saath bhojandaayee kii koshika main chodta he, ye anzime hai- reverse transcriptes or integres

 This is done by one of the enzymes found inside a virus, called reverse transcriptase
 jab ye diene prati ban jaati he or bhojandai koshika ke kendrak main mukt rup se pai jaati he to zaruri he ki ye bhojandai koshika ke jinom main shaamil ho jaae
 iskaa matlab he ki yah koshika ke bade diene anu main pravesh kare

 One problem with the use of retroviruses in gene therapy is that the integrase enzyme can enter arbitrary any position in the virus genome present in the genome of the feeding cell - and it can randomly convert genetic material into a chromosome
 yadi anuvanshik saamagree bhojandai koshika ke mul jeenon main se ek ke bich main pravesh kare to yah jin baadhit ho jayega 
 yadi yah wo jin he jo koshika vibhaajan ko niyantrit karata he to iske baadhit hone se koshika vibhaajan aniyantrit ho saktaa he

 Since then, the use of adenovirus carriers has emphasized genetically crippled forms of the virus
 parvovyrus parivaar ke,adino se jude virus ekal diene ke jinom vaale chote virus hai
 Wild-type AAV can penetrate genetic material at a specific location on the 19th chromosome with 100 percent certainty
 lekin ricombinant eevi jisamen koi bhi virus jin nahin hota balki sirf upachaaratmak jin hota he, vah jinom main ekikrut nahin hota

 There are also some drawbacks in the use of AAV, which includes that it contains only a small amount of DNA and is very difficult to produce
 phir bhi is prakaar ke virus kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, kyonki yah gaiyr rogajanak he
 
 Unlike adenoviruses, most people receiving AAV therapy do not make any attempts to remove the virus and the cells that have been successfully cured as an immune response
 Several trials with AV are underway or are under preparation, Are trying to treat diseases mainly in the eye and muscles, ie those two tissues where the virus is specifically It is useful to be
 haalaanki, naidanik pareekshan vahaan bhi shuru kiye gaye hai jahaan eevi vaahak mastishk ko jin pradaan karne ke kiye prayog kiye jate hai
 This is possible because AAV viruses can infect cells that are not dividing, such as neurons in which their genomes are expressed for a long time
 upar varnit virus vaahakon ke paas aisi prakritik bhojandaayee koshika jansankhya hoti he jise ki ve sabase adhik kushalta se sankramit kar sakate he
 The natural feeding cells of retroviruses are limited to a range and although adenoviruses and adeno-virus-associated viruses can efficiently infect a relatively broad range of cells, there are some cell types that are also refractory to infection with these viruses
 Huh

 Retroviruses and adeno-associated viruses have a single layer of protein on their membranes, while the surface of the adenovirus has both an envelope protein and a membrane that extends away from the virus surface

 xxrep 4 = lypoplaxes or poliplaxes To improve the distribution of new DNA in the cell, the DNA must be protected from any damage and its entry into the cell should be convenient
 For this, new molecules are made of lipoplexes and polyplexes, which have the ability to process transfection
 Protect DNA from undesirable decay
 plasmid diene missel yaa ek lyposom ek sangathit dhaanche kii tarah lipid ke aavaran main rah saktaa he
 When this organized structure is mixed with DNA, it is called liposome
 lipid teen prakaar ke hote hai, rinatmak, udasin, yaa dhanayanit 
 shuru main, sanshleshit vaahakon ke liye lypoplaxes ke nirmaan main rinatmak or udasin lipid kaa prayog hota tha
 But later, despite the fact that they have very little toxicity, they are compatible with bodily fluids and are likely to adapt to tissue specificity; Because they are complex and take too much time, attention was shifted to cationic forms to create lipoplexes
 apane sakaaratmak aavesh ke kaaran dhanayanit lipid kaa prayog pehle rinatmak diene anu ko sanghanit karne main hota tha, taaki unki di en e ek capsule kaa rup lekar lyposom ban jaae
 baad main yah paaya gaya ki dhanayanit lipid lypoplaxes kii sthirataa ko kaaphi baadha dete hai
 In addition, due to their charge, cationic lipids interact with cell membranes, it was widely believed that endocytosis is the main route by the cell to take liposomes
 endocytosis ke parinamswarup endosom banate hai, lekin yadi jin indo som kii jhilli todakar koshika dravya main choda nahin ja saktaa, to unhen lisosom main bhej diya jayega jahaan unka kaary puraa karne se pehle sabhi diene nasht kar die jaayenge
yah bhi paaya gaya ki yadhyapi dhanayanit lipid swayan hi capsule rupi di en e ko sanghanit karke lyposom main badal sakate hai, lekin unki para sankraman prabhaavashiltaa bahut kam he kyonki endosomiy nistaar ke maamle main unki kshamta bahut kam he
 However, when adjuvant lipids were added to form lipoplexes, far more transfection effectiveness was observed
 baad main yah pataa laga ki kuch lipidon main ye kshamta he ki wo endosom kii jhilli ko visthirikrut kar sakate he taaki diene endosom se batch sake, isiilie un lipidon ko fujogenic lipid kaha jaataa he
 Although cationic liposomes are widely used as an alternative to gene delivery carriers or gene delivery vectors, they have also been found to have only toxicity, limiting their therapeutic use

 Recent studies have shown lipoplexes to be useful in infecting respiratory epithelial cells, so they may be used in the treatment of genetic respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis
 diene ke saath polimur ke jatil mishran ko poliplaxes kaha jaataa he
 Most polyplexes consist of cationic polymers and are produced as a result of ionic interactions
 poliplaxes or lypoplaxes ke kaary kii paddatiyon main ek bada antar ye he ki polyplaxes apane diene bhaar ko koshikadravya main mukt nahin kar sakate, atah iske liye indolytic abhikartaaon jaise ki adino virus ke saath sah parasankraman hona zaruri he
 However, this is not always the case, polymers such as polyethyl amine have their own ways of destroying indosomes, such as in ketosan and trimethylkytosan

 Other methods include other viral carriers mixed with cationic lipids or hybridized viruses

 Limitations of these competing reagents include the lack of ability to transfect multiple cell types, the lack of strong attack capability, incompatibility with animal specimens, and specificity

 Several theories have been presented about the origin of Malayalam language
 ek mat yah he ki bhugolic kaarnon se kisi aadi dravid bhashaa se malayalam ek swatantra bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui
 The second view to the contrary is that Malayalam is a language derived from Tamil

 malayalam main varnon or lipiyon ke bich koi sambandh nahin
 The relationship is between letters and scripts
 malayalam kii vishaal akshar sankhya ne lipi sudhaar ko kathit evam jatil banaaya
