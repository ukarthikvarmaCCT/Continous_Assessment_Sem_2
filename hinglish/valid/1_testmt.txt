 After the death of his father, Zafar was made Mughal emperor on 18 September 1837
 yah digar baat thi ki us samay tak dilli kii sultanate behad kamjor ho gai thi or mughal badshaah nammaatr kaa samraat rah gaya tha
 Zafar had to pay a heavy price for playing an important role in India's first freedom struggle

 Moreover, he was taken captive to Rangoon, where he died as a prisoner on November 7, 1862

 How much respect people had for him can be gauged from the fact that in many places in India, roads have been named after him, while in Lahore city of Pakistan, a road was named after him

 In 1857, when the spark of India's independence erupted, all the rebel soldiers and kings and emperors considered him Emperor of India and led them to brick by brick of the British
 angrejon ke khilaaf bhartiya sainikon kii baghawat ko dekh bahadur shah jafar kaa bhi gussa foot padaa or unhone angrejon ko hindustan se khadedane kaa aahvaan kar daalaa

 Bahadur Shah Zafar took refuge in Humayun's tomb, but Major Hadas captured him along with his son Mirza Mughal and Khizar Sultan and grandson Abu Bakr
 angrejon ne julm kii sabhi hadein paar kar deen
 When Bahadur Shah Zafar was hungry, the British served him in front of the plate and brought his sons heads
 unhone angrejon ko jawaab diya ki hindustan ke bete desh ke liye sir qurbaan kar apane baap ke paas isi andaaj main aayaa karte hai
 The British sent the last Mughal emperor out of the country to Rangoon to eliminate the rebellion for independence
 bahadur shah jafar sirf ek deshbhakt mughal badshaah hi nahin balki urdu ke mashhoor kavi bhi the
 He wrote a number of famous Urdu poems, many of which were lost or destroyed during the upheaval that broke out against the British
 unke dwaara urdu main likhi gai panktiyaan bhi kaaphi mashhoor hai- xxrep 4 , Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
,,, His Urdu poems continued to flourish in Rangoon outside the country

 yahi buniyadi farq tha moolbhoot hindustani vichaardhaara ke saath jo apane desh ko apni maan maanate he
 When King Zafar breathed his last while imprisoned in Rangoon, this lion of his own famous ghazal must have been on his lips- "how much is bad luck for Zafar Dawn, two yards of land was not even found in ku-i-yaar 
 " Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor to play an important role in India's first freedom struggle, is also noted as a great poet of Urdu
 unki shaayari bhavuk kavi kii bajaay deshbhakti ke josh se bhari rahati thi or yahi kaaran tha ki unhone angrej shaskaon ko takhte-landan tak hindustan kii shamsheer chalane kii chetavanee di thi
 According to public opinion, when the emperor Zafar was arrested after the first freedom struggle, an English military officer who knew Urdu said this lion while sarcastically saying - "dum dum nahi, now Khair mango ki a jafar is now sheath Is Shamsheer of India 

 !! " On this, Zafar gave a befitting reply and said - "there will be boo in Hindi when the talk of Iman, the planks will go till London

 One of the few orders he gave as soon as he became emperor was to ban cow slaughter
 is aadesh se pataa chalata he ki ve hindu-muslim ekta ke kitne bade pakshdhar the
 According to Dr
 Shailnath Chaturvedi, former Professor of History at Gorakhpur University, during the time of 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar was such a great personality, who was respected not only as a king but also as a secular person
 isiilie behad swaabhaavik tha ki meerut se vidroh kar jo sainik dilli pahunche unhone sabase pehle bahadur shah jafar ko apana badshaah banaaya
 Chaturvedi said in conversation that making Zafar the emperor was a message to the British rulers symbolically
 iske tahat bhartiya sainik yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki bharat ke kendra dilli main videshi nahin balki bhartiya shaasha kii satta chalegi
 Bahadur Shah Zafar's order to ban cow slaughter after becoming a king was not a new order
 balki akbar ne apane shasankaal main isi tarah kaa aadesh de rakhaa tha
 Zafar had merely started following this order again
 deshprem ke saath-saath jafar ke vyaktitv kaa ek anya pahalu shaayari thi

 After Zafar's death, his poetry was compiled under the name "kulliyat e Zafar"

 Catholicism or Roman Catholicism is a main branch of Christianity whose followers consider the Pope located in the Vatican city of Rome as their bishop
 isai dharm kii duusari mukhya shakha protestant kehalaati he or uske anuyaayi pope ke dharmik netritv ko nahin sweekaarte
 There are even greater differences in religious beliefs between Catholics and Protestants
 roman katholic carch isa ne apane bhavi anuyaayiyon kii shiksha diksha ke liye ek carch kii sthapana kii thi or sant peter ko iskaa adhyaksh niyat kiya tha
 Saint Peter died in Rome, from which the Bishop of Rome began to be considered the head of the Church

 The first oriental churches separated from Rome
 baad main protestant dharm kaa udai hua jiske falswaroop paashchaatya carch ke ek mahatvapurn ansh ne rome ke bishap kaa adhikaar asweekaar kar diya
 Notwithstanding all this, today, more than half of Christians around the world are members of the Roman Catholic Church
 yah carch roman kaha jaataa he kyonki rome ke vatican nagar se iskaa sanchaalan hota he
 The original meaning of Kathlik is broad
 katholic carch kaa daawa he ki vah yugaugantar tak arthath 'sab samay' 'sabhi deshon' ke manushyon ke liye khulaa rahata he or isa dwaara prakat kii gai 'sabhi' dharmik sachchaaiyaan sikhalaataa he
 The organization of the Catholic Church is strong and centralized

 rome main anek sthaayee samitiyaan or ayog hai jo cardinalon kii adhyakshata main samast roman katholic carch ke sanchaalan tathaa prashasan ke liye pope kii sahaayta karte hai
 Catholicism is called "catholicism" in English

 Organized Catholicism is also called "catholic Church" in English
 yah gaur-talab baat he ki yadhyapi "carch" shabd kaa arth "girizaa" hota he, "catholic carch" kaa arth "sampoorn catholic dharmik samudaay" bhi hota he
 Catholics believe that their religious organization continues the custom of the early Christian organization and is its sole heir
 ve maanate hai ki unki prarthana ritiyon main jo roti or madiraa kaa paan kiya jaataa he vah dharmik arth main isa messiah kaa maas or rakt ban jate hai jinhen prarthana karne vaale grahan karte hai
 This is not the case with Protestants
 catholic pope ko isai dharm kaa prithvi par param adhyaksh maanate hai jo ki protestant nahin maanate
 In this religious organization, there is one clergyman above each clergyman and finally the pope is above all others

 It is used for sleeping

 There are fixed pastures for grazing animals

 One is the common holy buffalo and the other is the most sacred buffalo

 At the same time, the most sacred buffalo are the property of the entire village

 For the most sacred buffaloes, a holy place is constructed by moving a little away from the village
 is pavitra sthaan ke kaary sanchaalan ke liye vishesh sanskaron kaa paalan karne vaale ek vyakti ko chunaa jaataa he, jise sthaneey bhashaa main palol kaha jaataa he

 Since ancient times, there has also been a practice of polyandry in the Toda tribe
 jab bhi kisi vyakti kaa vivaah sampann hota he to uski patni ko swat: hi us vyakti ke bhaiyon kii patni maan liya jaataa he
 But at the time of childbirth it is not necessary that the person who has brought that woman to marry is the father of that child
 isliye saamaajik va paariwarik kartavyon ke nirvaah ke liye toda samaaj main pita nirdhaarit karne kii ek vishesh parampara he
 According to this, in the seventh month of the womb, every brother who gives a symbolic material to his wife made of leaf and twig is called the father of his future child
 haalanki itnaa avashya he ki yadi bada bhai jivit ho to aksar vahi us stri ko pratikatmak dhnush-baan bhent karte hue parampara kaa nirvaah karata he
 Many times it happens that the brother of the symbolic dhunush-arrow is killed
 aisi sthiti main bhi vah na sirpaf apni mrityu se pehle utpann hone vaali santanon kaa pita kahalaaya jaataa he varan uski mrityu ke baad bhi utpann hone vaali sabhi santanon kaa tab tak pita kehalaata he, jab tak ki koi anya bhai apni patni ko pratikatmak dhnush-baan bhent na kar de
 Both Toda women and men wear white colored red and blue striped cloth which in local language is called Putkali
 toda log isko swayan nahin bunate hai
 From other places, they decorate it with artistic embroidery
 toda striyon kaa adhkitar samay sir main tel lagane, bal banane, kadhai karne va bhojan taiyaar karne main jaataa he
 Even before the onset of puberty, there is a tradition of tattooing among young women
 aksar binduon se hi godane kaa chithran kiya jaataa he
 For this, these people use thorns and after tattooing fill it with charcoal
 toda purushon kii lambaai ausat se kuch adhki hoti he or ve majboot kad-lathi ke hote hai
 Possibly an old scar or lump is found on the right shoulder of every male
 yah kandhe ko jalati lakdi se daagne se ban jaati he, jise ki ek sanskaar ke rup main har balak par banaaya jaataa he jab uski aayu baarah varsh kii hoti he
 From that time he starts milking buffaloes
 toda logon kaa maananaa he ki isse dudh duhane ke samay dard va thakaan nahin hoti he
 In the same way, a point is made with a cloth soaked in oil on the joints and wrists of the fingers of pregnant women
 is sambandh main unka maananaa he ki isse garbh ke dauraan swasthya kii raksha hoti he or vah kisi buree chaaya se bachi rahati hai
 The Toda tribe has another wonderful tradition
 prakritik sansadhano par nirbhar hone ke kaaran toda logon ko nilgiri kii pahadiyon main aksar hi pashu chaare ke liye ghaas ke nae maidaanon kii khoj kerani padati he
 In such a situation, sometimes the entire village is shifted along with its member families
 iske atirikt, toda log kai baar apane tyaage gaye rahane ke puraane sthanon kii bhi rdhm bhav se yaatr karte hai
 In these tours, they take their families and cattle with them
 donon hi sthitiyon main pariwaron kii striyaan va ladkiyaan pashuon ke jhund ke pahadiyon ke dhedh-medhe maarg se nikal jane tak ek sthaan par baithi rahati hai
 While the men lift the household goods and try to walk on the parallel path of the herd
 is prakaar uchit sthaan par pahunchane ke uparant ve saamaan rakhkar pun: apni striyon va ladakiyon ke paas aate hai or ek-ek karken unhen haathon se uthaakar vah maarg paar karaate hai
 In this way, they do not allow their women and girls to cross the path made of cow-buffalo hooves

 According to Scott and Duncan, "middle Eastern Europe has suffered more than 150 recorded famines from 1500 AD to 1700 AD, while in Russia there have been 100 years of starvation and 121 years of famine from 971 AD to 1974 AD

 Symbol in Abhigyanasakuntal - Scheme
 
 Vasantkumar M
 Bhatt Director, Bhasha Sahitya Bhavan, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad - 380 009 0 – 1 bhoomikaah- kavion ne brahmand ke kain padaarthon main maanviya samvednaaon or swabhaav kaa pratibimb dekha he, atah ve uskaa pratik ke rup main viniyog karke bhi nav-naveen kavy-sarjan karte he
 Specifically the annotation of the nature-rich substances in poetry is a covenant of human sensations well known by all poets
 lekin aisa lagata he ki is vishay main kalidas kaa darshan kuch gahera he
 In the view of Kalidasa, there is no separate existence in this universe like man and nature
 kalidas ke liye to manushya bhi prakruti kaa hi apruthak ang he
 Therefore, in the writing of human love in Abhigyanasakuntal, nature not only evokes human sensations, or echoes not only human sensations, but it also shows indirect involvement in human love affairs
 prastut natyakruti main aadi se ant tak prakruti ke jo bhi vividh pashu, pakshi evam pushpadi kaa viniyog hua he, ve sab naatak kii paatrasrushti ke abhinn ang he
 But in Abhigyanasakuntal, Hari, Hans and Kamaladi are also appropriated as symbols
 atah prastut aalekh main abhigyanshakuntal kii pratik-yojana evam in se vyakt honevaale natyakaarya kaa sarvangin rup se avlokan karnaa abhisht he
 
 0 – 3 mahakavi kalidas ke abhigyanshakuntal naatak main prayukt vibhinn pratikon kii charchaa shooru karne se pehle is naatak kii purvanirdhaarit gati kya he ? yah bhi gyatavya he
 Generally, all the gentle readers know that Dushyant's attainment of the son of Chakravarti is the ultimate goal of this drama
 lekin, kalidas ne pratham ank main hi anya do sandarbhon main bhi naatak kii anya gati-vidhiyon kaa nirdesh kiya he
 Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to keep in mind the combination of three-dimensional symbols like 1
 Harini, 2
 Hans and 3
 Lotus, used for Shakuntala with poet-assigned total three-dimensional motion directions
 is drushti se samiksha karne par abhigyanshakuntal ke pratikon se abhivyakt honevaala natyakaarya yatharth rup main prakat hoga
 
 1 – 1 is naatak ke armbh main, sutaradhar ke suzav par nati ne greeshm-ritu kaa geet gaaya haih--- "kshanchumbitani bhramarah sukumaarakesarshikhani
 Avatansayanti Dayamana: Pramada: Shirishkusumani
 
 "it has been said here that for a moment kissed by the illusors, the coriander flowers beautify themselves by wearing rituals showing mercy to them
 athwa kaho ki, un pushpon ko aabhushanon kaa gaurav pradaan karti he
 Commentator Raghavabhatta says that it is intended to direct Shakuntala from the pramadas holding Shirishpaspu here
 parantu yahan par kuch gambheer arth bhi chhipa hua dikhataa he
 Kalidas is going to go ahead for Shakuntala, saying that she loved adornment, however she never broke a leaf of trees
 yahan prashn hota he ki to phir vah apane kaanon main kyun shirispushpon ko dhaaran karti thi ? is prashn kaa maarmik uttar nati-geet main diya gaya he
 Bhrmar sits for a moment on the flowers and immediately after leaving the rasp leaves them
 sansar main jo bhi stri ke jivan main aisi ghatana ghatit hoti he, uskaa vichaar shakuntala karti he or uske chitt main besumar vednaa hoti he
 That is why she holds such shirish flowers in her ears and honors them
 rajarshi vishwamitra ne menka ko kshan bhar ke liye apanaaya or turant hi uskaa parityag bhi kar diya
 But the progeny that was born by momentary coincidence was Shakuntala
 is tarah, nayika jo shirispushp dhaaran karti he uske peeche chhipi hui ukt bhaavana uske janm kii kahani se judy hui he
 Any woman receiving momentary love of any man, if abandoned by him, then the life of that woman definitely becomes compassionate
 kintu us kshanik sanyog se jo santati paidaa hoti he, uske abhigyaan kii bhi samasya khadi ho jaati he, jo duhsadhay hoti he
 When does Dushyant consider such a painful destiny that is probably born in woman's life, expressed in this Nati-song? We want to see that
 or, shakuntala ke putr bharat kaa "daushyanti" ke rup main abhigyaan kab siddh hota he ? vah bhi aanushanbik rup se dekhnaa he
 This first reference to the pace of the play is laid out in the Natyagit and its relation to the word "abhigyan" in the title
 mahabharat main varnit shakuntalopakhyaan main bhi shakuntala ke putr ke abhigyaan kii hi samasya kendra main thi
 Therefore, it is important to understand the deep sense of the Nati-song in Prakrit
 isi sandarbh main, is naatak main dushyant ke liye prayukt bhramar kaa pratik, evam nayika ke liye prayukt shiris, amramanjari or camel jaise vividh pushpon ke pratikatmak nirdesh vichaarneey ban jate he
 
 1 – 2 pratham ank ke armbh main mrugayavihari raja dushyant kaa pravesh hota he
 Then a voice comes from the background saying 'neither hantavyao, nor hantavayah, ashrammrigo s yam' iti
 dushyant ko kaha jaataa he ki- tat sadhukritsandhanan pratisanhar cycm
 Aartatranaye vaa shastram, nor prahartumanagasi
 kanvamuni ke shishyon kii yah dhwani sunakar mrugaya ke liye niklaa raja dushyant turant hi apane baan kaa sanharan kar letaa he
 Then Munijan blesses the king in his affirmation that the birth is Yasya Purovanshe Yuktarupamidav Tav
 putramevangunopetan chakravartina awapnuhi
 
 puruvansh main utpann hue aapke liye yahi samuchit he
 Because your arrows can only be for the protection of the person, they should not hurt any innocent person
 or, chunki aapane baan kaa sanharan kar liya he, aapako aapke jaise hi gunonvale chakravarti putr kii prapti ho
 This blessing has been called the ultimate goal of the abhigyan-shakuntal drama
 is liye ab hamen dekhnaa he ki samgr naatak kii gati kaise putraprapti paryant chalati rahati he ?
 Here, Dushyant had coddled the arrow at the behest of the Rishikumaris
 parantu harin ke peeche daudta aa rahaa dushyant prathamak ke ant tak shakuntala kaa prem jit hi letaa he
 It is known from this that the Mahakavi has placed Harien here as a symbol of Shakuntala
 jaise jaise naatak aage badhata he vaise vaise prekshkon ko spasht hota jaataa he ki nayika shakuntala kii jeevanakatha bhi is harin ke pratik se hi kahi ja rahi he
 And for the sake of that, that story also changes
 shikari evam harini ke vyaktitv main sahaj rup se hi visamvaad anternihit he
 Or say that both of them are indulgent
 kintu adarsh daampaty jivan main to vahi spruhaniya he ki pati-patni donon paraspar ke liye bhokta-bhogy ho
 Therefore, when such an ideal situation is created in the play, it is visible
 ab prekshkon kaa dhyaan us ore hi aakrisht hoga ki nayak-nayika ke bich aisi samaan bhoomika kaa nirmaan hone ke baad hi dushyant ko putr bharat kii prapti ho
 Because the blessings given by the disciples of Kanva Muni were given word by word, on the condition of not killing the doe
 is tarah natigeet se nirdisht abhigyaan kii samasya ke saath jab putraprapti rup dusraa lakshya judta he tab akthith rup se nayak-nayika ke daampaty-jivan kii samadhi pehle siddh hona idan prathamatya aavashyak ban jaataa he
 The semblance of the prodigy of observers is logically expected to be expressed in this order
 1 – 4 prathamak main hi kavi ne puure naatak kaa charmotkrisht shikhar bhi pratikatmak rup se kah rakhaa haih-- anusuya kii ek ukti ke dwaara shakuntala ke liye ‘swayamvarvadhoo vanajyotsna’ or nayak dushyant ke liye ‘sahakaar-vriksh’ kaa pratikatmak nirdesh kiya he
 However, only the immediate marriage of these two is reported by the word Swayamvarvadhu
 kintu antatogatva to, sahakaaravriksh par ashrith vanajyotsna naamak lata ke chitra se ek spruhaniya daampaty jivan kaa chir abhilashit adarsh bhi abhivyakt ho rahaa he, yah bhi dhyanarh he
 
 2 – 0 naatak ke sheershak main jo "abhigyaan" shabd rakhaa gaya he uske saath sambandh rakhanevaali gati kaa jahaan nirdesh he us nati-geet kaa pehle vichaar karenge
 In order to understand the sound that comes out from the words of the Nati-song, it is also necessary to take into consideration the symbolic instructions of flowers like Shirishpushp, Amramanjari and Kamal at the place throughout the play
 or pushpon se jude bhramar ke pratik kaa bhi saath main hi vichaar karnaa hoga
 2 - 3 After understanding the symbols of the various flowers used in this play, we should now analyze the illusions mentioned in many places, starting from the Natyagita
 vidwanmtanusaar dushyant ko bhramar hi kaha gaya he
 But does the symbol of corruption repeatedly mentioned in the entire work universally reflect the same nature of the hero? This is natural
 kyonki mahakavi ne sarvatra bhramar kaa dushyant ke saath sarvatha abhed karke nirupan nahin kiya he
 a total of five times Bhramar is mentioned in this drama
 atah in sabhi ullekhon ke uplakshya main bhramar ke pratik se vyakt honevaale vyangyarth kaa punarvichaar karnaa jaruri he
 Esha Kusumnishanna Trishatapi Sati Bhavatman pratipalayati madhukari na khalu madhu vina twaya pibati
 
 a
sha
 6 / 19 3 - 0 After considering the Nati-song from the three temporal directions of the play, we will now pay attention to the extreme goal of the play as stated in the first verse
 mrugayavihari raja dushyant ke pravesh se pratham drishy kaa armbh hota he
 Dushyant shines on the wandering deer on the banks of the Malini River
 kintu kanv muni ke shishyon ne raja ko saavdhaan kiya ki yah ashram kaa mrug he, uskaa vadh nahin karnaa chaiye
 Dharmabhiru Dushyant accepted his point and coddled his arrow
 is satkruty ke liye raja ko chakravarti putr kii prapti ho aise aashirvachan diye jate he
 Here Dushyant does not hunt the antelope of the ashram, but he is definitely attracted to the girl, Shakuntala, Kanva's grandson
 or tisare ank tak jate jate in donon kaa pranay gandharv-vivaah main parinat bhi hota he
 In this way, all the poetical people know from the beginning that the great poet has used the symbol of the doe for Shakuntala
 yahan is harin ke pratik ke dwaara mahakavi ne 1
 dushyant ke saamne upasthit honevaali shakuntala ke swabhaav kii abhivyanjana kii he, or 2
 aage chal kar shakuntala or harin ke jivan kii purna rup se samarasata khadi karke, chaturthank main karun ras kii vednaa ko tivratar banaai he
 
 3 – 2 naatak ke armbh main dushyant ne ashram ke mrug ko nahin maarake chakravarti putr kii prapti ke aashirwad praapt kiye the
 But thinking from an elemental point of view, then it will not be enough to leave the prey of macro deer
 kyonki mrug yadi shakuntala kaa pratik he to dushyant ne jo shakuntala kaa pratyaakhyaan kiya he, vah ashram-mrug ko maarane ke samaan hi karm tha
 So now it will be seen when Dushyant gets Shakuntala, and Chakravarti's son
 is tarah ke viksit hue natyakaarya kii jhaankhi shashthank main honevaali he
 Upon the receipt of the fingerprint, the curse of Durvasa is retired
 or dushyant ko shakuntala kaa punassmaran hota he
 Then Shakuntala's words of that repudiation time, Shakuntala's eyes showing disdain - all of this comes in front of Dushyant's vision
 ab dushyant ko baari santaap ho rahaa he, dunyavi koi cheez usko anand nahin detii he
 The world seems destructive without Shakuntala, so she has tied all the festivities
 is tarah ke virahaalekhan ko dekh kar aisa sochna paryaapt nahin hoga ki kavi ne tritiyank main sambhog shringaar kaa aalekhan karne ke baad, yahan shashthank main vipralambh shringaar ko varnit karne ke liye hi dushyant ko shakuntala kaa samaran karavaaya he
 Actually, looking at Shakthanka, it is known that Kalidas has shown the exclusion of the hero-heroine in the first three digits, but now they are committed to prove the perfect union of these two
 is sandarbh main shashthank ke 1

 evam, esha kusumnishnna trushitapi sati xxrep 4 
 – ye teen shlokon ko punahpunah dekhne kii param aavashyaktaa he
 Because the great poet here has absorbed all the central symbols like hans-mithun, hari-harini, Shakuntabhusha of Shakuntala and Shirish Pushp and lotus and Bhrmar in one place
 or ek hi sthaan par sabhi mahatvapurn pratikon kaa kramshah viniyog karke, mahakavi ne viksit hue natyakaarya kaa yahan par hridayasparshi udghaatan kiya he

 abhigyanshakuntal kaa uparyukt vivaran dekhakar prathit hoga ki prem jaisi naiysargik samvednaa kaa aalekhan karne ke liye nisarg ke hi pratik hridayasparshi ho sakate he - yah param rahasy sab se pehle mahakavi kalidas ko hi praapt hua he
 Perhaps in this context, in the context of the calculation of poets, the junior teacher Kalidasa has made Anamika a Sarthavati
 
 2
 Kalidasa's unspoken attitude towards the traditional food-related relationship between men and women is considered by the traditional society
 kyonki jahaan bhoktri-bhogyabhav hota he vahaan ucchavachata bhi anternihit hoti he
 But by portraying the hero-heroine as a deer and a deer, the Mahakavi has embodied equal enjoyment and satiety among the two by awakening the desire for companionship in madhukar-madhukari, and showing the two as Ramamanthan as Hansamithun
 3
 nati-geet main jo dhyanaspad he vah to kshan bhar ke liye chumbit or baad main parityakt shirispushpon kii dayaneey dasha he, usamen ullikhit bhramar dhyanakarshak nahin he
 The Mahabharata-propitious Shakuntalopakhyana had only the problem of cognition and was described as frivolous
 usamen parishkar karte hue mahakavi ne strijivan kii karunasabhar niyati ko bhi shaamil kiya he, tathaa usko samast prakruti me faile shirishadi pushpon ke dwaara vaachaa di he
 4
 So "dushyant had illusions and the poet has cursed the curse of Durvasa for its elimination" This intent seems revisional despite being attractive
 kyonki uparyukt pratik-charchaa ke anusaar to dushyant ke liye bhramar kaa pratik sarvansh main ghatit nahin hota he
 The development of the theatrical work that the poet has demonstrated through appropriation of Pratyut Bhramar is the same
 5
 tathaa "shakuntala main atithi-satkar kii bhaavana nahin thi, is liye usko bhi shaap kaa fal mila he" aisa kahana bhi uchit nahin he
 Because the poet has not said anywhere that Shakuntala is repenting
 balki shakuntala ko to ant tak yah malum bhi nahin he ki usko koi shaap mila tha
 Therefore, the matter of repentance is not compatible with Prakrit
 6
 naatak ke armbh main hi kaha gaya he ki pita kanv shakuntala ke pratikul daiv kaa shaman karne ke liye somtirth kii yatra par gayi he
 In the research of this, the curse of Durvasa has to be called the symbol of Durdaiva
 or shakuntala ne bhi yahi kaha he ki mere koi purakrit ke kaaran hi aryaputra kuch kaal ke liye mujh se viras ho gayi the
 In this way, considering the drama's epilogue, it is logical to consider the curse of Durvasa as a symbol of Shakuntala's misdeeds
 7
 or shakuntala ke liye prayukt parabhritika yaa chakravaak pakshi ke pratik bhi shakuntala ke durdaiv kaa hi prakat rup kaha ja saktaa he

 Part of the category of rajkumaari yashodhara coliy vansh ke raja suppabuddha or unki patni pamita kii putree thim
 Yashodhara's mother- Pamita was the sister of King Shuddhodana

 Later Siddhartha became a Gautama monk and became known as Gautama Buddha

 Over time, his intellect also develops, which is evident from his utterances
 parantu yah sab ekadam swaabhaavik nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In some cases, Rahul talks tactfully, like Prudo, which is certainly exaggerated even in the context of a born child

 Social structure is a fundamental concept of sociology but has been interpreted in various ways
 herbat spencer jaivikiy anurupata se itane prabhavit the ki unhone saamaajik sanranchana kii tulana maanav sharir se kii
 He said that just as there are different parts of the body and they all maintain the physical structure, in the same way there are different parts of the society which maintain the structure of the society
 redcliff brown kaa mat tha ki jab kabhi ham saamaajik sanrachana kaa ullekh karte hai to saamaajik saranchana se hamaara abhipraay ek vyavastha se hota he jisamen us vyavastha va saranchana ke vibhinn tatv ek-duusare se jude hote he
 This equation and systematic method of elements can be called structure
 saamaajik saranchana ke sandarbh main vyakti ko us sanrachana kii ikai maanate hai
 Individuals are made in one place in social structure
 unka ek vyavastha main sthaan grahan karnaa ek saamaajik prakriya ke tahat hota he jiske antargat kuch pratimaanon ke kaaran unhen vah sthaan mila hota he
 Thus social structure is a systematic form of the individual in which their social relations are governed by a particular institutional value
 agar ham parivaar ke banaavat kii baat karen to us parivaar main rahane vaale logon kii baat karenge jo log us parivaar ke kuch sambandhon se jude hote hai
 The member of that family has to play a special role
 is prakaar ek sanghathan main sabhi vyaktiyon ko apni-apni bhoomika adaa karne ke liye ek-duusare se judaa hona aavashyak he
 SF Nadel has also seen the interpretation of the word structure by associating it with the organ of a systematic composite in which all elements are connected to each other by that arrangement
 unke anusaar samaaj main teen tatv sadaiv maujuud rahete hai- All these norms and rules determine the position and role of a person
 saamaajik saranchana kii vyakhya karte hue kuch samajashastriyon ne isse sthaayee sambandhon kii baat ko bhi mahatv diya he
 They believe that by any texture, we mean those organs that make up that texture, which contribute to maintain that texture permanently
 is vichaar ko prakat karte hue harry em janson ne bhoomika tathaa upasamooh ke saranchanaatmak sabandh ke paraspar aatmanirbharta kii baat par bal diya he
 Referring to the two patterns of models, he has mentioned the following patterns
 is prakaar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki saamaajik saranchana kii vyakhya karte hue adhikansh samajashastriyon ne do saiddhanthik pakshon ko ujagar kiya he
 In the first category, we can talk about the theoretical idea that has a form of social structure that can be seen and tested
 prakaaryawad ke siddhanth main saamaajik saranchana kaa ek spasht swaroop he jiskaa varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 The second category deals with those sociological creations that have an unmatched form of the structure of society that cannot be seen and tested
 tisare prakaar kaa vichaar ko kuch samajashastriyon ne saiddhanthik rup se ubhaara he jisamen saamaajik saranchana ke sambandhon ko sthayitv miltaa he
 Relationships get a real foundation
 redcliff brown tathaa es epa nadel donon is vichaar ke himachati the jinhone saamaajik saranchana ke kuch sthaayee tatwon kii baat kii jisase vyakti ke vyavhaar bhi niyantrit hote hai or unke vyavhaar ko niyantrit karne kaa ek sansthaatmak aadhaar miltaa he
 Talcat Parsons said that the social structure can be understood by social system
 unka vichaar tha ki kisi bhi saamaajik sanrachana ko samajhane ke liye us samaaj ke mulyon kaa tathaa uske sansthaatmak swaroop ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 According to him, any social system has to perform four major social functions permanently- in sabhi kaaryon ko acchhee tarah sampadit karne ke liye upasamooh hote hai
 The subgroups that have to work with the social system and all these tasks are things performed in an institutional way
 anukulan kaa kaary nispadit hota he aarthik vyavastha ke dwaara jo saamaajik vyavastha ke ang yaa mahatvapurn ikai ke rup main kaary karata he
 Similarly, the achievement of the goal is achieved by the political system, which acts as a part or important unit of the social system
 pratimaan anurakshan ke kaary kaa nishpaadan swajan arthath naatedari dwaara hota he
 The work of integration is performed by the cultural system and community organization
 uparyukt vivechan se yah spasht he ki saamaajik saranchana kii avadharana ko ek mahatvapurn avadharana tathaa siddhanth se jodakar dekha ja saktaa he
 The concept of social structure is also seen to be associated with the theory of conflict, but its principles have been recognized by some sociologists in the context of social order but still avoid traditional sociology from its deliberations
 antarbhasha kaa arth he - 'anek bhashaaon ke madhya ek sarvanishtha bhashaa'
 It is an international national language
 chunki ek bhashaa duusari se sarvatha pruthak hoti he at: aisi bhashaa swaabhaavik na hokar kritrim hi ho sakati he
 In the modern era, there were two attempts to create a world language

 anterrashtriya: Local: kisi bhi bhashaa ke ve shabd avyay kehalaate hai jinke rup main ling, vachan, purush, kaarak, kaal ityadi ke kaaran koi vikaar utpatr nahin hota
 Such words remain in their original form in every situation
 chunki avyay kaa roopaantar nahin hota, isliye aise shabd avikari hote hai
 The literal meaning of avayya is- 'which is not spent

 In the second half of the nineteenth century, Swami Dayanand Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj with the aim of reviving the Indian society intellectually, ideologically and spiritually
 unhone "vedon kii ore waapas" jane kaa aahvaan kiya jiskaa vaastavik arth "shiksha kaa prasar" karnaa tha
 Swami Dayanand believed that through the spread of education, awakening will occur in every nook and corner of the country

 In Pampé and Caesar, a situation of war arose due to tension and competition to unite

 Sennett ordered that Caesar resign from his Gaul command before he was elected as the second Consul, who had previously been assured of him

 Pampé and the Roman government had very few experienced soldiers in Italy, so they vacated Rome and Caesar took possession of the capital without opposition

 Caesar crossed the mountains and entered Thessaly and in 48 BC
