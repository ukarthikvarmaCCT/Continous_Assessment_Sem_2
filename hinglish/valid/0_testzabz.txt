 The composition which makes the sensation in the heart of the audience not only by hearing but also by sight, is called drama or visual poetry
 naatak main shravy kavy se adhik romaniyata hoti he
 Being audible, it is more closely related to folk consciousness
 naatyashaastra main lok chetana ko naatak ke lekhan or manchan kii mul prerana mana gaya he
 The play is counted in poems

 In it, the name of one type of poetry is called Prakarna

 sahityadarpan main naatak ke lakshan, bhed aadi adhik spasht rup se die hai
 It has been written above that a distinction of visual poetry is called drama
 drishy kavy ke mukhya do vibhaag hai— roopak or uparupak
 There are ten distinctions of metaphor - metaphor, drama, episode, speech, vyayoga, samvakara, dhim, ehamraig, ankavithi, and farce
 'uparupak' ke atharah bhed hai— naatika, trotak, goshtee, sattak, natayaraasak, prasthaan, ullapya, kavy, prekshna, raasak, sanlapak, srigadith, shinpak, vilasika, durmallika, prakaranika, hallisha or bhanika
 According to the above distinctions, the term drama speaks in the sense of visual poetry
 sahityadarpan ke anusaar naatak kisi khyath vrutt ' kii lekar likhaanaa chahie
 It should be full of many luxuries, pleasures, sorrows, and many juices
 usamen paanch se lekar das tak ank hone chahie
 The protagonist of the play must be a majestic man or Rajarshi of Dhirodatta and eminent dynasty
 naatak ke pradhan yaa angi ras shringaar or vir hai
 The remaining juices are secondary
 shanti, karunaa aadi jis rupak main main prathan ho vah naatak nahin kahala saktaa
 There must be an astonishing trade in the treaty
 upsanhaar main mangal hi dikhaaya janaa chahie
 The break drama is against the Sanskrit Alankar Shastra
 abhinay aarambh hone ke pehle jo kriya hoti he, use purvarang kehete hai
 After the puvarang, the chieftain nut or sutradhara, also known as the founder, comes and praises the gathering, then the nuts, nati sutradhars, etc
 have an interactive conversation in which the subject of the play being played, poet-lineage narration etc
 are covered
 naatak ke is ansh ko prastaavna kehete hai
 The chronicle with which the play is composed is called the object
 'vastu' do prakaar kii hoti he—aadhikarik vastu or praasangik vastu
 The one who is the main hero of all the chronicles is called 'adhikari'
 is adhikari ke sambandh main jo kuch varnan kiya jaataa he use 'aadhikarik vastu kehete hai; jaise, ramlila main ram kaa charitra
 For the benevolence of this officer or with reference to rasupati, whose description comes, it is called a relevant thing; Such as the character of Sugriva, etc
 'saamne laane' arthath drishy sanmukh upasthit karne ko abhinay kehete hai
 Therefore, the name of Avasthanuparupa or Swang is acting
 abhinay chaar prakaar kaa hota he— angik, vaachik, aharya or satvik
 The act that is done with the gesture of the organs is done with the help of words, what is done with the words of speech, what is done by making disguises, what is done by the vibrations of the food and emotions, by the vibrations, sweat, etc
 is called satvik

 ek desh vyapee charitravarnan ko prakari kehete hai
 Whatever is done for the success of the action initiated is called action; Like, Ravana slaughter in Ramlila

 Here, with the word 'present', 'virah present' looks like this and a kind of miracle appears
 sanskrit sahitya main naatak sambandhi aise hi anek kaushalon kii udbhaavna kii gai he or anek prakaar ke vibhed dikhaae gaye hai
 Nowadays, the new plays which are written in the national languages, following all the rules of Sanskrit plays or inclusion of subjects is considered unnecessary
 bhaaratendu harishchandra likhte hai—'sanskrit naatak kii bhanti hindi naatak main unka anusandhan karnaa yaa kisi naatakang main inako ytnpurvak rakhkar naatak likhnaa vyarth he; kyonki pracheen lakshan rakhkar aadhunik naatakadi kii shobhaa sampadan karne se ulta fal hota he or ytn vyarth ho jaataa he
 Acting and theater in India was produced during the Vedic period itself
 tatpashchaat sanskrit rangamanch to apni unnati kii paraakaashtha par pahunch gaya tha-bharat muni kaa naatyashaastra iskaa pramaan he
 In very ancient times, Sanskrit dramas in India were no longer the language of religious occasions, cultural festivals, social ceremonies and state speech, so the staging of Sanskrit plays ended
 bharatvarsh main naatakon kaa prachaar bahut pracheen kaal se hai
 The drama of Bharata Muni is very old
 ramayana, mahabharat, harivansh ityadi main nat or naatak kaa ullekh he
 Panini has taken the names of two Natasutraks named ‘shilali’ and ‘krishashva’
 shilaali kaa naam shukla yajurvedic shatapath brahman or samavedic anupad sutara main miltaa hai
 According to astrology, scholars have told the Shatapatha Brahmin above 4000 years
 atah kuch paashchaatya vidwaanon kii yah raay haq greece yaa yunaan main hi sabase pehle naatak kaa pradurbhaav hua, thik nahin he
 It is written in Harivansh that when Pradyumna, Samb Adi Yadav went to Prince Vajranabha's purse, he played the Ram Janmabha and the Rambhabhisar plays there
 pehle unhone nepathy bandha tha jiske bheetar se striyon ne madhur swar se gaan kiya tha
 Yadav named Shur was made Ravan, a woman named Manvoti became Rambha, Pradyumna Nalakubar and Samb were made clowns
 wilson aadi paashchaatya vidwaanon ne spasht sweekaar kiya hai ki hinduon ne apane yahan naatak kaa pradurbhaav apane aap kiya tha
 The ancient Hindu kings used to build large colorants
 madhyapradesh main sarguja ek pahari sthaan he, vahaan ek gupha ke bheetar is prakaar kii ek rangashaala ke chihn paae gaye hai
 It is true that Sanskrit dramas are not available nowadays before the arrival of the Greeks, but their absence from this fact cannot be considered, given this much evidence
 sambhav he, kalasampann unani jati se jab hindu jati kaa milan hua ho tab jis prakaar kuch or or baaten ek ne duusare kii grahan kii
 Similarly, some things in relation to the drama must have been taken by Hindus
 bahyapati kaa 'jawanika' naam dekh kuch log yavan sansarg suchit karte hai
 From the 'visual' Sanskrit plays in the numerals, it is estimated that the pictures used to remain on these tracks
 astu adhik se adhik is vishay main yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki atyant pracheen kaal main jo abhinay hua karte the
 Paintings were not used in them
 sikandar ke aane ke peeche unka prachaar hua
 Even now Ramlila, Raslila are without screens
 madhyakaal main pradeshik bhashaaon main loktantr kaa udai hua
 It is a strange coincidence that in the Muslim period, where the religious fanatics of the rulers broke the literary tradition of India, there was a good spread of Lok Manch in the local languages
 raasalila, ramlila tathaa nautanki aadi ke rup main lokdharmee natyamanch bana rahaa
 In the Bhaktikal, on one side, Krishna's Rasleela was widely practiced in Braj Bhasha and on the other hand, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, Ramlila started celebrating with great pomp in small towns across India
 saahitiyik drushti se is madhyakaal main kuch sanskrit naatakon ke padhyabaddh hindi chhayanuwaad bhi hue, jaise nevaaj krit ‘abhigyaan shaakuntal’, somnath krit ‘malti-madhav’, hridayramcharita ‘hanumannatak’ aadi; kuch moulik padhyabaddh sanvadatmak rachanaayen bhi huin, jaise lachhiraam krit ‘karunaabharan’, raghuram nagar krit ‘sabhasaar’, ganesh kavi krit ‘pradhyumnvijay’ aadi; par inamen naatakeey paddati kaa purnataya nirvaah nahin hua
 These can only be called interactive compositions
 is prakaar saahitiyik drushti tathaa saahitiyik rachanaaon ke abhaav ke kaaran madhyakaal main saahitiyik rangakarm kii ore koi pravriti nahin hui
 The truth is that before the rise of commercial and literary theater in the modern period, only the folk theater of Ramlila, Nautanki etc
 kept Hindi theater alive for four-five hundred years
 yah lokmanch-parampara aaj tak vibhinn roopon main samooche desh main vartmaan he
 Apart from Ramlila in North India, 'veer Abhimanyu', 'satya Harishchandra' etc
 dramas based on Mahabharata and 'roop-basant', 'heer-ranjha', 'haqikatarai', 'bilvamangal' etc
 are popular till date
 aadhunik kaal main angreji rajya kii sthapana ke saath rangamanch ko protsaahan mila
 As a result, commercial drama circles were established all over India
 natyarangan kii pravriti sarvapratham banglaa main dikhaai di
 Around 1835 AD, many unofficial theater in Calcutta were built
 kalakatta ke kuch sambhrant pariwaron or raison ne inke nirmaan main yoga diya tha or duusari ore vyavayayik naatak mandaliyon ke asaahitiyik prayaas se alag tha
 The study of this drama-creation of Bengali and the Natyarangan is important because the condition, direction and inspiration of Bharatendu Harishchandra's Rangandolan was derived from it
 banglaa ke is aarmabhik saahitiyik prayaas main jo naatak rache gaye ve mul sanskrit yaa angreji naatakon ke chhayanuwaad yaa roopaantar the
 It is clear that Bharatendu's initial effort was also in the shadow of Sanskrit plays
 hindi rangamanchi saahitiyik naatakon main sabase pehla hindi geetinaty amaanat krit ‘inder sabha’ kaha ja saktaa he jo san 1853 i
 main lakhanu ke nawab waajid alishaah ke darbar main khelaa gaya tha
 The Urdu-style experiment in it was similar to that adopted by Parsi drama circles in their plays
 san 1862 i
 main kaashi main ‘janaki mangal’ naamak vishuddh hindi naatak khelaa gaya tha
 The Parsi circles — Original Victoria, Empress Victoria, Elphinstone Theatrical Company, Alfred Theatrical and New Alfred Company, etc
 — went far beyond the above-mentioned effort of the aforementioned literary theater
 sarvapratham bombai or baad main hyderabad, lakhanu, banaras, dilli lahore aadi kai kendron or sthanon se ye companiyaan desh-bhar main gum-ghumkar hindi naatakon kaa pradarshan karne lageen
 For these Parsi drama circles, writers like Nasrabani Khan Sahab, Raunak Banarsi, Vinayak Prasad 'talib', 'ahsan' etc
 first wrote plays
 janata kaa sasta manoranjan or dhanoparjan hi in companiyon kaa mukhya uddeshy tha
 That is why they did not have special purpose from high-quality literary plays
 dharmik-puranic tathaa prem-pradhan naatakon ko hi ye apane rangamanch par dikhaati thim
 He did not hesitate to perform cheap and vulgar
 isi se janata kii ruchi bhrasht karne kaa dosha in par lagaaya jaataa he
 Due to the excursion, the theater of these companies also used to roam with them
 kisi sthaayee rangamanch kii sthapana inke dwaara bhi sambhav nahin thi
 The structure of the theater was constructed by bullies and picture-bizarre curtains were hung on the stage
 bhadkeeli-chatakili veshbhusha, pardon kii nai-nai chitrakaari tathaa chamatkaarpurn drishy-vidhaan kii ore inkaa adhik dhyaan rahata tha
 The curtains were raised according to the scenery
 sangeet-vaadya kaa aayojan stage ke agle bhaag main hota tha
 The crass comical scenes were deliberately placed in between the scenes
 bich-bich main shaayari, gajalen or tukbandi khub chalati thi
 The language was a mixed form of urdu-hindi
 samvaad padya-rup tathaa tukpurna khub hote the
 There have also been some playwrights such as Radheshyam Kathachakak, Narayan Prasad Betab, Aghashr Kashmiri, Harikrishna Johar etc
 who have tried to improve the Parsi theater by giving some literary elements and tried to bring Hindi to this commercial theater
 par vyavsaayik vritti ke kaaran sambhavat: is rangamanch par sudhaar sambhav nahin tha
 Due to this, these playwrights also had to become commercial
 is prakaar parsi rangamanch na viksit ho sakaa, na sthaayee hi ban sakaa
 Plays in Hindi are thought to begin with Bharatendu Harishchandra
 us kaal ke bharatendu tathaa unke samakaleen naatakakaron ne lok chetana ke vikaas ke liye naatakon kii rachana kii isliye us samay kii saamaajik samasyaon ko naatakon main abhivyakt hone kaa acha avasar mila
 As has been said, the creation of non-commercial literary theater in Hindi can be considered from the geographical metaphor called 'inder Sabha' of 'amanat' Lakhanvi
 par sach to yah he ki ‘inder sabha’ kii vastav main rangamanchi kriti nahin thi
 It used to have an open stage under the canopy
 nautanki kii tarah teen ore darshak baithte the, ek ore takht par raja inder kaa asana laga diya jaataa tha, saath main pariyon ke liye kursiyaan rakhi jaati thim
 a scarlet curtain was hung behind the decorations
 isi ke peeche se paatro kaa pravesh karaayaa jaataa tha
 King Inder, fairies etc
 characters once came and were present there
 ve apane samvaad bolkar waapas nahin jate the
 At that time, Natyarangan became so popular that many meetings were organized following the 'inder Sabha' of Amanat, such as 'madarilal's Inder Sabha', 'daryai Inder Sabha', 'hawaiian Inder Sabha' etc
 parsi naatak mandaliyon ne bhi in sabhaaon or majaliseparistaan ko apanaaya
 These compositions were not plays, nor did they form the theater of Hindi
 isi se bharatendu harishchandr inako 'naatakabhas' kehete the
 He wrote 'bandar Sabha' as his parody
 sanskrit naatakon kaa yug dhalane laga tab chaudaavin shatabdi se unnisvi shatabdi tak unka sthaan vibhinn bhartiya bhashaaon main lok naatakon ne liya
 Today, folk drama is known by different names in different regions

 In response to Operation Grand Slam by Pakistan, the commander of the Indian Western Army, General Harbakhsh Singh, commenced offensive operations with the 1st and 11th Corps

 Dalit literature refers to the literary movement keeping the writing on Dalit life and its problems at the center, which can be traced to the Dalit Panther
 daliton ko hindu samaaj vyavastha main sabase nichle paaydaan par hone ke kaaran nyaay, shiksha, samanta tathaa swatantraaa aadi moulik adhikaron se bhi vanchit rakhaa gaya
 They were considered untouchables or untouchables in their own religion

 There were long debates about the concept of Dalit literature
 In Dalit literature, the question was dominated by who can write Dalit literature, ie will self-realization be authentic or will sympathy also get place
 pramukh dalit sahityakaron ne kaha chunki savarnon ne daliton kii peeda ko bhoga nahin, isliye ve dalit sahitya nahin likh sakate
 haalanki yah mat zyada dinon tak tikaa nahin, lekin aarambh main bahes kaa mudda bana rahaa
 This question was raised more in Hindi than Marathi
 Finally, there was a view that Dalit literature is a literary movement that emerged in the decade of Assi and Nabi, in which the creators born in Dalit society predominantly participated and struggled to make it a separate stream
 haalanki sahitya main dalit varg kii upasthiti buddha kaal se mukherit rahi he kintu ek lakshith maanavadhikaar andolan ke rup main dalit sahitya mukhyatah beesvin sadi kii dein he

 Although it was not easy to use and it also required a special kind of furnace, so it was used in most hotels and industries for a long time
 It had to wait until the twentieth century to reach people's homes
 The term 'pressure cooker' was used for the first time in the year 1915
 At the global fair held in New York, New York in 1939, Alfred Wischler displayed for the first time an aluminum pressure cooker, which was shaped like a home-cooked cooking dish or pot
 ise aadhunik cooker kaa shuruuaati rup maan sakate hai | yah mondal jald ghar-ghar main lokapriy ho gaya | Amarushatakam is a lyrical phrase in Sanskrit

 Some of the fame of this century can be traced to its rich commentaries
 iske upar das vyakhyaaon kii rachana vibhinn shatabdiyon main kii gai jinamein arjuna varmdev kii 'rasik sanjivani' apni vidvatta tathaa maarmikata ke liye prasiddh he
 In Anandavardhan's opinion, the emancipators of Amaruk are so succulent and soulful that even when they are small, they have the ability to manage the poetry
 sanskrit ke alankarikon ne dhvanikavy ke udhaaharan ke liye iske bahut se padya uddhrut kar inaki saahitiyik sushamaa kaa parichay diya he
 Amaruk is not a poetess, but is a perfect poetess, whose main goal is the abundant flourishing of juice in poetry
 amarushtak ke padya shringaar ras se purna hai tathaa prem ke jite jaagate chatakile chitra khinchne main vishesh samarth hai
 Extremely subtle and psychological analysis of the adorable attitudes existing in various stages of lovers and girlfriends is the main feature of these Saras verses

 Narsi occupies almost the same place as Surdas in Hindi in Gujarati literature as Padpanrata
 vaishnav jan to taine kahie je peed paraai jaane re' pankti se aarambh honevaala suvikhyath pad narsi mehta kaa hi he
 Narsi, by compiling the essence of Vaishnavism in it, has introduced his insight and innate humanism
 narsi kii is udaar vaishnav bhakthi kaa prabhaav gujarat main aaj tak lakshith hota he
 In Pushtimarga, Narsi is considered "brides" but Narsi does not seem to be associated with any sect
 unki bhakthi bhagavatashrith thi
 Krishna's Raslila was a special favorite of Narsi as compared to the other Leelas, and he described himself participating in Raas by becoming "divitio" or Deepwakah in a situation of emotional identification
 ve gujarat ke sarvaadhik lokapri vaishnav kavi hai tathaa lokkalpana main unke jivan se sambhddha kinvadantiyon evam chamatkaarik ghatnaon ke prati sahaj vishwasabhaavna milti he

 According to him, due to the influence of Chaitanya, the time of Narsi Mehta cannot be considered before 1500-1580 AD

 After his expulsion, since childhood, Narsi had to lead a miserable life

 After marriage, two children named Kunwar Bai and Shamaldas were born to wife Manikbai
 krishnabhakt hone se purv unke shaiva hone ke pramaan milte hai
 It is said that it was due to the blessings of Mahadev "gopinath" that he saw Krishna Lila who turned his life in a completely new direction
 grihasth jivan main chamatkaarik rup se apane aradhy kii ore se sahaayta praapt hone ke anek varnan unki aatmcharitaparak kai rachanaaon main uplabdh hote hai
 Similarly, God helped Narasila many times
 inamen "hundi", "jhaari", "mameru" or "haar" kaa prasang sarvapramukh he
 The "dheed" episode also holds a significant importance in the biography of Narsi, as a result of which she was socially boycotted
 ve stri or shudra ko bhakthi kaa adhikari samajhate the jiske kaaran samast nagar jati unase kshubdh ho gai thi
 Narsi did not let her intuition get frustrated with external influences
 yah unke vyaktitv kii sabase badi visheshta he
 You did not pay any attention to the housework
 sara samay krishna bhakthi main hi lage rahete
 Your brother gave your marriage to Manekbai so that you could take care of the house, but even with marriage, Narasimha did not care
 narsingh mehta kii bhabhi aap ko bahut bhala bura kahati thi
 One day, fed up with the words of sister-in-law, you went to the forest and worshiped in the temple of Shiva for 7 days without eating
 bhagwaan shiv ek sadhu ke rup main pragat hue
 At the request of Narasimhaji, Lord Shiva took you to show Ras Leela in Vrindavan
 aap raas lila dekhte hue itane kho gaye kii mashaal se apana haath jala bethe
 Lord Krishna raised his hand as before with his touch and blessed Narasimha Ji
 ghar aakar aap ne bhabhi kaa dhanyavad kiya
 Once Narasimha and his brother were passing through a forest while going on pilgrimage
 donon bahut thak chuke the or bhukh bhi bahut lagi thi
 a village appeared at some distance
 us gaanv ke kuch log in donon ke paas aaye or kaha kii agar aap kahen to ham aap ke liye khaanaa le aate hai, par lekin ham shudra jaati ke hai
 Narasimha Ji told them that all are children of God, you are the people of Hari, i have no problem in eating your food
 narsingh ne khushi se bhojan khaaya lekin unke bhai ne bhojan khaane se inkaar car diya
 Before walking, when Narasimha woke up to thank the villagers, he could not see the village anywhere

 Once some sadhus going to Dwarka came to Narasimha ji and gave them five hundred rupees and said that you are very famous person, you should write a bill of five hundred rupees in your name and we will go to Dwarka and take the bill
 pehle to narsingh ji ne manaa karte hue kaha kii main to garib aadmi hoon, mere pahchaan kaa koi seth nahin jo tumhe dwarka main hundi de degaa, par jab sadhu nahin maane to unhon ne kaagaj laa kar paanch sau rupaye kii hundi dwarka main dene ke liye likh di or dene vaale kaa naam saanwal shah likh diya
 On reaching Dwarka city, the saints searched everywhere but Samwal Shah was not found anywhere
 sab kehane lage kii ab yah hundi tum narsila se hi lenaa
 On the other hand, Narasimha ji started bringing in the goods of those five hundred rupees
 jab sara bhandara ho gaaya to ant main ek vruddh sant bhojan ke liye aae
 Narasimha ji's wife made all the utensils which were empty and four loaves of flour which were left and fed them to that old saint
 jaise hi us sant ne roti khai vaise hi udhar dwarka main bhagwaan ne saanwal shah ke rup main pragat ho kar santon ko hundi de di
 Acharya ji also gives evidence of this in the small aarti of Anandev

 And in the Bharu Chowk gave sands of money to the saints

 Narasimha was very poor, he said that daughter, i have nothing to give in marriage

 When Narasimha ji arrived at Dhyoti's wedding, a woman asked him that his daughter's maternal uncle and maternal grandfather had come, what he had given in the wedding
 aage se samadhani ne majaak main kah diya kii do bhaathe diye hai
 Hearing this, Narasimha became ashamed and remembering God and asked him to save his honor

 God brought red suit, chunari, all the wedding brocade, jewel, pearl, diamond, horse, palanquin and many other gifts for the girl

 Finally, after reviewing it in various ways, it seems that Shrimad Bhagwat should be considered as Puran and it is appropriate to keep Devi Bhagwat in the category of Uppurana
 shrimadbhagwat devibhagwat ke swarupanirdesh ke vishay main maun he
 But Devi Bhagwat counts 'bhagavata' under the subpuras and itself under the Puranas
 devibhagapancham skandh main varnit bhuvankosh shrimadbhagwat ke pancham skandh main prastut is vishay kaa aksharsh: anukaran karata he

 The Bhagwat himself states- 'vidyavataan bhagavate pariksha' : bhagwat vidvatta kii kasuti he or isi kaaran tikasampatti kii drushti se bhi yah athulaneey he
 Scholars of various Vaishnava sects have advocated self-explanatory interpretations on Bhagavat for the subsistence and affirmation of their specific doctrine, in which some commentators are briefly mentioned here: bhagwat ke deshkal kaa yatharth nirnay abhi tak nahin ho paaya he
 In the eleventh wing, people drinking water from Dravidian rivers like Kaveri, Tamraparni, Kritamala, etc

 With this, the creation of Bhagwat cannot be considered archaic by the seventh century
 nimnlikhit talika main kuch vidwaanon dwaara sujhaayaa gaya bhagwat puraana kaa rachanakaal diya gaya he- The influence of Bhagwat was very active in the rise of medieval Vaishnava sects and was particularly important in the rise of Krishna poems of the provincial languages of India

 Inspired by the narration, Radhakrishna has sung a beautiful keli in his various poems
 tamil, andhra, kannada tathaa malayalam ke vaishnav kaviyon ke upar bhi bhagwat kaa prabhaav bhi kam nahin he
 Bhagwat's spiritual outlook is of monotheism and devotion is devotional
 is prakaar advait ke saath bhakthi kaa samrasya bhagwat kii apni vishistataa he
 For these reasons, Bhagwat is considered to be the undercurrent of Kavyatrayi of Sanskrit along with Valmiki Ramayana and Mahabharata

 The culture of Varanasi is inextricably linked to the river Ganges and its religious significance
 ye shahar sahasron varshon se bharat kaa, visheshkar uttar bharat kaa saanskrithik evam dharmik kendra rahaa he
 The Banaras Gharana of Hindustani classical music was born and developed in Varanasi itself

 Eminent American writer Mark Twain writes: "benaras is more ancient than history, older than traditions, older than legends and, when collected, is twice as old as that collection
 " The name Varanasi probably originates from the name of two local rivers, the Varuna River and the Asi River
 ye nadiyaan ganga nadi main kramshah uttar evam dakshin se aakar milti hai
 Another idea of the name comes from the name of the river Varuna, which may have been called Varanasi in ancient times and this is how the city got its name
 iske samarthan main shaayad kuch aarambhik paath uplabdh hon, kintu is duusare vichaar ko itihaasavetta sahi nahin maanate hai
 For a long time, Varanasi has also been referred to as the non-liberated region, anand-kanan, Mahashmshan, Surandhan, Brahmavart, Sudarshan, Ramya, and Kashi
 rugveda main shahar ko kaashi yaa kasi naam se bulaayaa gaya he
 It is derived from the word published, which refers to the historical level of the city, as the city has always been the center of knowledge, education and culture
 kaashi shabd sabase pehle atharvaveda kii papplad shakha se aayaa he or iske baad shatapath main bhi ullekh he

 In a verse, Lord Shiva says: teenon lokon se samahit ek shahar he, jisamen sthit meraa nivas prasaad he kaashi Another reference to Varanasi is given by sage Ved Vyas in another prose: ganga tarang romantic jatkalapnaam, gauri nirantar vibhooshit vambhagam
narayanprium anang madapaaaram, varanasipur patim bhaj vishwanatham The name of the river Varanavati has appeared in the Atharvaveda, which is most likely used for the modern Varuna river itself

 Eighty is not mentioned here

 It is known from the above quotes that the city was actually named after settling on Varanasi

 By the way, the word Varana is also the name of a tree
 prachinkaal main vrikshon ke naam par bhi nagaron ke naam padate the jaise koshamb se kaushambi, rohit se rohitak ityadi
 Therefore, it is possible that both Varanasi and Varanavati got their name only from this particular tree
 varanasi naam ke uparokt kaaran se yah anumaan kadaapi nahin lagaana chaiye ki is nagar ke se ukt vivechan se yah na samaj lenaa chahie ki kaashi rajya ke is rajdhani shahar kaa keval ek hi naam tha

 The Yajurvedi Jabal Upanishad gives an important description about Kashi, but modern scholars do not consider this Upanishad as ancient
 jabal-upanishad khand-2 main maharishi atri ne maharishi yajyavlky se avyakt or anant paramatma ko jaanane kaa tarika poocha
 Then Yajnavalkya said that that latent and eternal soul can be worshiped in the free zone, because it is right there

 vah varna kya he or vah nashi kya he, yah poochne par uttar mila ki indriya-krit sabhi dosha kaa nivaaran karne vaali varna he or indriya-krit sabhi paapon kaa naash karne vaali nashi he

 Apart from this, Kashi is also mentioned in sanskrit-vadmay, Daskumarcharit, Naishadh, Rajatarangini and Kuttanipatam
 12veen shatabdi isvi tak praapt hone vaale ling puraana main tisare se attharahawein adhyay tak kaashi ke devaytanon tathaa tirthen kaa vistrut varnan tha
 The Lingapurana was the same in the composition of the Tristhalisetu Granth
 arthath lingapurana main bhi tisare se solahaven adhyay tak lingo kaa varnan kiya he
 In the present Linga Purana, only one chapter is about Kashi, which contains only 144 verses
 is prakaar mahabharat ke alaava yadi sabhi puraanon ke ullekh dekhen, to kaashi ke tirth rup ke ullekh kii suchi bahut lambii banati he
 There are 264 pilgrimages mentioned in the word Kalkalpadrum, but in the idea of glory, the names of Char Dham and Saptapuris are considered at the top among the pilgrimages of India
 prayag, gaya or gangasagar tak ke naam inamen nahin aate
 Therefore, it can also be ruled out
 varanasi kshetra ke vistaar ke anek puranic uddhran uplabdh hai
 According to the pilgrimage discussion and other ancient texts given in Karyakalpataru: uparokt uddharanon se gyaat hota he ki pracheen varanasi kaa vistaar kaaphi dur tak tha
 The fort of Rajghat west of Varuna where ancient Varanasi is no doubt inhabited is a mile long and 400 yards wide
 ganga nadi uske dakshin-purv mukh kii raksha karti he or varuna nadi uttar or uttar-purv mukhon kii raksha ek chhichhli khai ke rup main karti he, pashchim kii ore ek khaali naala he jisamen se hokar kisi samay varuna nadi bahati thi
 Given this natural means of defense, perhaps in ancient times this place was chosen for the city of Varanasi

 ke pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke samay angrejon ne bhi nagar raksha ke liye varuna ke peeche oonchi jameen par kachi mitti kii deevaaren uthaakar kilebandi kii thi
 The limit of Varanasi in the Puranas is much more than the length and breadth of Rajghat
 un varnanon se lagata he ki vahaan keval nagar kii seemaa hi nahin varnit he, balki puure kshetra ko sammilit kar liya gaya he
 The remains of ancient settlements are found far to the far side of Varuna
 atah sambhav he ki puraanon main mili varnan ve sab bhaag bhi aa gayi hon
 If we consider this area to be connected to the city, then the length and breadth of the city described in the Puranas is almost right
 gautam buddha ke janm purv mahajanapad yug main varanasi kaashi janapad kii rajdhani thi
 But it is difficult to estimate accurately about the expansion of ancient Kashi district
 jaatakon main kaashi kaa vistaar 300 yojan diya gaya he
 In the north of Kashi district was Kosal district, Magadha district in the east and Vatsa in the west
 itihaasavetta dow oltekar ke matanusaar kaashi janapad kaa vistaar uttar-pashchim kii ore 250 mile tak tha, kyonki iskaa purv kaa padosi janapad magadh or uttar-pashchim kaa padosi janapad uttar paanchal tha
 According to the Jataka, the boundaries of Kashi and Kosal were mixed
 kaashi kii dakshin seemaa kaa sahi varnan uplabdh nahin he, shaayad isaliye ki vah vindhyas shrinkhalaa tak gai hui thi va aage koi aabaadi nahin thi
 On the basis of the natives, the expansion of Kashi must have been extending from present Ballia to Kanpur
 yahaan shri rahul sankrutyaayan kehete hai, ki aadhunik banaras kamishnari hi pracheen kaashi janapad rahaa tha
 It is possible that some part of modern Gorakhpur Commissionerate has been included in Kashi district
 puru kul ke raja divodas dwaara duusari varanasi kii sthapana kaa ullekh mahabharat or anya granthon main aata he
 There is also a possibility of this city being in the baraunt
 is bare main pandit kubernath sukul ke anusaar bairaat khandhar baan ganga ke dakshin kinare par he vam par nahin
 In this way the stream of Ganges between Gomti and Bairant becomes a barrier
 ganga ke raste badalane, baan ganga main ganga ke bahane or ganga-gomti sangam saidpur ke paas hone ke bare main aage sukulaji ne mahabharat ke hawaale se bataaya he ki ganga-gomti sangam par markendeya tirth tha, jo vartmaan main kathi ke sameep sthit he
 Therefore, it can be said that if the ganga-gomti confluence was near Saidpur then it may have been pre-mahabharata and not after the third century AD
