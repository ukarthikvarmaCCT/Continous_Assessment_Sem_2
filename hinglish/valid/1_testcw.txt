 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar dwaara kosi baadh raahat ke liye bheji gai raashi gujarat ko lautaa die jane par bhaajapa ne apni nakhushi jaahir karte hue sawaal kiya ki aisa karke kya ve baadh peediton ke prati vyakt bhaavana or samvednaa ko bhi lautaa sakate hai
 BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said, "when given the money, it was a symbol of solidarity and empathy of the people of Gujarat towards the problems of the flood affected people of Bihar
" ’’ unhone kaha ki bihar ke sthaneey akhabaaron main bihari yuvak dwaara prakashit karwaae gaye ek vigyaapan ko lekar dhan lautaaya janaa uchit nahin he
 Nirmala said without naming Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, "bihar had then accepted the money in the same spirit as Gujarat
 ab kuch vigyaapan ke chalate, mukhyamantri :nitish: ne use lautaane kaa faisla kiya he
 i wonder whether the money has been returned or the feeling of empathy, solidarity and brotherhood has also been returned
 ’’ patna main haal main yojit bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke dauraan sthaneey akhabaaron main vigyaapan chape the jisamen 2008 kii kosi baadh ke samay sahaayta ke liye gujarat ke mukhyamantri kaa dhanyavad kiya gaya tha
 Some advertisements also featured pictures of Nitish and Modi shaking hands
 nitish ne un vigyapanon ko ‘‘asay’’ bataate hue kaha tha sahaayta die jane kaa saarvajanik gungan nahin kiya jaataa he
 The Chief Minister of Bihar had warned to return that amount and today he also returned five crores rupees to Gujarat
 kai dinon se agra main hue 57 muslim pariwaron kaa dharm-parivartan kaa maamla news paper or television main charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 The talk grew so much that it reached Parliament and another excuse was made for mps not to work
 ab aage kii khabar he ki 25 disambar yani christmas ke din aligarh main 5000 logon kii hindu dharm main 'ghar-vaapasi' kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 Some people are calling such an incident against the secular structure of India and some are calling it 'homecoming' and say that if someone wants to return home voluntarily by correcting their mistake, then no one should have any objection needed
 dharm-parivartan sahi he ki galat, is par charchaa baad main karenge par filhal baat karenge soshal netwarking site main aae aise twit kii jo sansad main maahaul garm karne vaale netaaon or sadak par utre logon ke vichaaron se bilkul bhinn he
 In the tweet, "indian journalists do not create a ruckus when the forced conversion of Hindus is done
" tab badi khabar kyon ban jaati he, jab musalamaanon ko hindu banaaya jaataa he
 'this is not to say of any Sanghi, BJP, but Taslima Nasreen, the famous writer of Bangladesh
 taslima nasrin aage kahati hai, 'pehle musalamaanon or isaayiyon ne logon ko khaane or paise kaa laalach dekar jabardastee dharm-parivartan karavaaya, ab hindu bhi vahi kar rahe hai
 Islam does not exist without forced conversions
 " Now Taslima is a well-known writer, it is also important that from time to time, she will also talk 'disputed'
 unke aaj ke twit se kuch log sahamat honge to kuch log asahmat
 But let's try to find out how true it is
 25 june 2012 ko kerala ke mukhyamantri oman chandi ne vidhansabha ko jaankaree di ki 2006 se 2012 tak 7713 logon ne islam dharm ko apanaaya jabaki 2803 log hi hindu bane
 Between 2009-2012, 2687 women became Muslims, including 2195 Hindus and 492 Christians
 itani badi khabar ko tab local or neshnal donon media ne bhav nahin diya or na hi yah itani gambhir ban saki kii sansad main charchaa kaa vishay ban sake
 The second information is that of Odisha's Kandhamal, which was not considered sensitive by the media
 shaayad yah alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf kaa maamla nahin tha
 Only a few newspapers gave it a place in their pages
 kandhamal bahut samay se isai or hindu sanghathanon ke bich shakti pradarshan kaa ek centre ban kar rah gaya he
 The National Minorities Commission reported in the 2008 Kandhamal Riots report that there has been a huge increase in the population of Christians in this region compared to Hindus
 bhartiya janaganana ke mutabik kandhamal main isaayiyon kii jansankhya 1961 main sirf 19,128 thi jo 2001 main badhkar ek lakh 17 hazaar ho gai, chalis saalon main 66 pratishat kii badhotaree
 However, the Freedom of Religion Act 1967 of Odisha is against forced conversion
 par yah kanoon yah bhi kahata he, magistrate kii manjuuri lekar koi bhi apana dharm-parivartan kar saktaa he
 After so many years, only two people have applied for conversion
 is ilaake main isaayiyon kii jansankhya main thode hi samay main bhari vruddhi kaa jawaab rajya sarkaar ke paas bhi nahin he
 The National Minorities Commission said in its 2008 report that the Freedom of Religion Act has been in force in the state for 40 years, but not a single case of forced conversion has been recorded so far
 bhale hi kisi ne jabardastee kaa prayog nahin kiya, par bahakaane or phuslane ke kai maamle saamne aae hai
 It was a matter of our media that which news it thinks is sensitive and which is not
 ab baat karte hai, dharm-parivartan kii jise english main proxlitism kehete hai or aresas kii bhashaa main ghar vaapasi
 In Arya Samaj, purification is the method of baptism in Christians
 aap 'l elaha ilal-allaah' or 'mohammad-ur rasul allaah' kah kar islam main aa sakate hai
 But the people of Hindu organizations do not know that there is no method of conversion to Hindu religion, there is no system
 ab hindu sanghathan vaale koun sa veda mantra pard kar dharm parivartan karvaa rahe hai ye vahi jane
 Since independence, the issue of conversion has remained sensitive
 centre main haalanki koi kanoon nahin ban sakaa he, par kuch rajyon ne isko lekar kanoon banaae hai, jaise odisha, madhya pradesh, arunachal pradesh, himachal pradesh, gujarat or chhattisgarh
 Nevertheless, by converting people to lure or by luring them, their conversion is still being done
 dukh kii baat he bharat kii media ko tab tak ye mudda gambhir yaa kahe bharat kii dharmanirpekshata ke khilaaf nahin lagata jab tak iskaa shikaar koi alpsankhyak samudaay se na ho
 Even today, Islam and Christianity are expanding all over the world, otherwise the number of Christians today is not two billion and the number of Muslims is one billion 80 crore

 khalanaayak ke ballu balram kii tarah jail to tuchche todate hai, main to furr ho jaaoongaa
 It was not the dialogue of any film, but the lyrics of Anandpal Singh, the infamous gangster of the state in Ajmer Jail, Rajasthan
 or iske kuch hi din baad api ke naam se kukhyat anandapal bilkul isi andaaj main faraar ho gaya
 Anandpal was being brought back to Ajmer Jail in police escort after the appearance of Anandpal in the Nanuram murder case in Didwana, Nagaur district on September 3
 parbatsar ke gangava gaanv ke paas jyon hi police vine pahunchi, pikup main savaar kuch badmaash uske peeche lag gaye
 He shot and wounded the police jawans in Bollywood style and injured Anandpal and his associates Subhash Mandu and Srivallabh
 lekin kahani itani sidhi bhi nahin he
 This incident has not only increased the possibility of gang war in Rajasthan, but the Jat and Rajput communities have come face to face
 rajput samudaay kaa anandapal 2006 ke gopal phogawat or jivan godara hatyakand ke alaava 2014 main bikaner jail main hue gangvaar ko lekar khaasaa surkhiyon main rahaa he
 He was attacked in jail by his rival Raju Tehat gang of the Jat community
 phogawat or godara bhi jat samudaay ke the or anandapal jat aparaadhiyon ke khilaaf rajput pratik ban gaya tha
 So, once again there is resentment in the Jat community, then Anandpal supporters are happy
 siyasat kaa tadakaa2006 main godara hatyakand ke baad jat samudaay andolit ho gaya tha
 All this came to an end after Anandpal's arrest in 2012 after dozens of demonstrations by him
 ab uske faraar hone se ek baar phir vahi halaat hai
 Jats held a meeting in Didwana recently and Independent MLA and Jat leader Hanuman Beniwal from Khivansar lashed out at the Vasundhara Raje government
 unhone mantri younus khan par anandapal se mileebhagat kaa aarope lagaaya or mantri rajendra singh rathod or mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ko bhi lapete main liya
 Beniwal alleged, "anandpal has the patronage of the big leaders of the government, at his behest he has escaped
" '' khan or rathod ise sire se khaarij karte hai
 "this is a criminal matter, it should not be politically blamed," says Rathore
 ''jaaton ke aakrosh ke baad rajput samudaay kii karani sena or anya sanghathanon ne bhi hallaa bol diya he
 Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi of Karni Sena says, "we have no objection if the law does its job, but if the encounter of Anandpal is done at the behest of Jat leaders, the Rajput community will not tolerate it
" ''sarkari drama yaa laaparvaaheedijipi manoj bhatta ne is maamle main parbatsar thanadhyaksh samet 12 pulicekarmiyon ko nilambit kar diya he
 But this does not hide the negligence of the police
 police ko pehle se anandapal ke faraar hone kaa andeshaa tha
 Former Nagaur SP Raghavendra Suhasa had written a letter to the police headquarters anticipating that a video conferencing should be arranged for his appearance
 lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 Moreover, the day he absconded, only about 15 policemen were stationed in his escort on that day, whereas usually there were more policemen in it
 chaar maah pehle anandapal samarthak kukhyat anuraadhaa choudhary ne bhi bataaya tha ki vah jald hi faraar hone vaala he
 Clearly, the role of the police is questionable
 ajmer jail main band kukhyat hathiyaar taskar amin khan ko bhi isi escort team ke jawan kai suvidhaayen de rahe the
 Even a few weeks ago, on the day of his appearance in court, he was given a tour of the house
 dijipi ko isaki jaankaree die jane ke baad bhi is par koi karrwai nahin hui
 Anandpal's arrest in 2012 was no less dramatic
 use jaipur ke ek farm house se hathiyaaron ke jakhire ke saath aasaani se pakadaa gaya tha
 Some people call it preplanned because the assembly elections were due next year and Jats were angry at his absence
 kuch log yah bhi maanate hai ki baahar uske liye khatra bad gaya tha isliye use jail ke bheetar surakshit rakhane ke liye naatak rachaa gaya
 Now his run away is also seen in the same way
 bikaner jail gangvaar main vah batch niklaa tha par uskaa saathi balbir banooda maaraa gaya tha
 He was then shifted from Bikaner to Ajmer Jail
 aise main jail main use khatra tha
 Trouble for the government, Anandpal has considerable influence in the Shekhawati region of the state
 rajputon main use robinhood sareekha mana jaataa he
 Some of his companions in his village Savarad, some distance away from Didwana, say on condition of anonymity, "he was willing to help everyone
" '' vahiin karani sena ke sukhdev singh bataate hai ki bidio ke saath marpet or 2002 main kheraaj hatyakand main funsane ke baad anandapal ne peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Many criminals joined him and formed a gang of about 500 operatives
 jat aparaadhiyon ke saath uski ladaai jagajaahir thi
 He also carried out ransom-kidnapping incidents from prison
 uskaa ek bhai rupendrapal singh bhi faraar he or doosraa, manjit jail main he
 On the other hand, SOG and ATS are investigating Anandpal's absconding
 ajmer kii iji malini agarwal bataati hai, ''anandapal ke escort main tainaat pulicekarmiyon se poochtacha or chhapemari jari he
 '' One lakh on that
 or uske saathiyon par 50,000-50,000 ru
 The reward of has been declared
 grih mantri gulabchand kataaria ne police kii chook ko mana par ise lekar gairjimmedaarana bayaan de daalaa, ''mere paas koi jaadu kaa danda nahin he
 "but Jat and Rajput organizations coming face to face again is a danger bell
" rajput jahaan pehle se bijepi kaa samarthan karte aae hai, to pichley chunaavon main raaje ne baari sankhya main jaaton ko party kii ore modaa tha
 Now the Anandpal issue can become a big problem for the Raje government

 The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) made its contribution and installed its radar imaging satellites
 bharat sarkaar ne is kaam ke liye america se madad maangi thi lekin sari kavayaden naakaam sabit huin
 After all, why the AN-32 could not be found after such a massive search operation? The reason for this is that the underwater locator Bicon was not in the missing plane

 Due to lack of Bicon, the hands of the team engaged in the rescue were left empty and the debris of the missing aircraft could not be found

 According to data released by the Chinese National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau on October 7, China's foreign exchange reserves reached 30 trillion US $ 87 billion by the end of September, up 22 from the end of August
 7 arab america dollar kam hua
 Thus 0 during a month in China's foreign exchange reserves

 According to statistics, China's foreign exchange reserves decreased by $ 23 billion in September 3
 087 trillian dollar ho gaya he
 China's Reserve 3 in August
 105 trillian dollar tha
 At the same time, at the beginning of President Donald Trump's term in the US, China's reserves were at the level of $ 4 trillion
 china ke paas he duniya kaa sabase bada dollar rigervadrasal china, america kaa sabase bada trading partner he or america-china vyapaar beete ek dashak se bhi adhik samay se china ke paksh main rahaa he
 That is, America has to incur a huge trade deficit in business from China
 saamaanya shabdon main kahen to america ke mukaable china apana zyada utpaada america ko bech rahaa he or iske chalate uske paas duniya kaa sabase bada dollar rigerv ekatra ho rahaa he
 Economic experts claim that China still has a $ 3 trillion dollar reserve and this reserve in the current trade war will protect it from the effects of trade war
 haalanki is baat kii sambhaavna se inkaar bhi nahin kiya ja rahaa he ki yadi trade war yun hi chalata rahaa to bahut jald antarrashtriya vyapaar main china ko mili dollar rigerv kii yah sanjivani beasar ho jaaegi or vah ek gambhir aarthik sankat ke muhane par khadaa ho jayega
 China's economy is able to counter external risks, although the threat of China's currency reserves hovering has been denied by National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau spokeswoman Wang Chunying, claiming that China's foreign exchange market is steadily stable in September
 bazaar kii mukhya vyapaarik gatividhi tarksangat va suvyavasthit he
 The dollar index in the international finance market is equal to the end of August
 pramukh deshon kii band keemat thodaa giri, or videshi mudra bhandar thodaa kam hua
 According to this spokesman, although there will be great uncertainty in the external environment in the future, China's economy is capable of combating external risks and China's foreign exchange reserves will remain stable
 ho sakati hai china kii sarkari companiyaan difoltergauratlab he ki trade war ke saath-saath china main vikaas dar main bhi giravat darj ho rahi he
 At the same time, there is a tough challenge before the banks of China
 ek anumaan ke mutabik china kii arthvyavastha kaa ek tihaai hissaa china ke bainkon ke karj ke taur par he
 At the same time, loans of Chinese state-owned banks are higher than the central bank's limit and due to these loans being given to government companies, they are out of control of the central bank
 aarthik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki yadi china main aarthik vikaas dar lagaataar kamjor bani rahi yaa america main byaaj daron main ho rahe ijaphe se china main vaishvik niveshkon ko rokane ke liye bhi byaaj daron main tej vruddhi kii jaae to badi sankhya main china kii sarkari companiyaan difolter ho sakati hai
 That is why, according to a report by chinawall Street Journal, in the current state of trade war, the rich section of China is scared
 report ke mutabik yah varg america dollar or yues tregeri main nivesh ko tarjeeh de rahaa he
 Significantly, there are 21 lakh families in China in this category, they have assets of $ 2 trillion to $ 4 trillion in stocks, bonds and real estate
 lihaaja, china ke kendriya bank ko is baat kaa bhi dar he ki yadi dollar ke mukaable vah yuan ko saport dene kaa kaam karata he to yah varg apana nivesh china se nikaalkar anya arthvyavasthaaon kaa bhi rukh kar saktaa he
 So, although the current state of the trade war is giving relief to China due to the foreign exchange reserves, but if the situation remains unchanged, Donald Trump will be on the lookout to defeat China in the trade war by emptying China's foreign exchange reserves

 Aaj Tak deputy editor, Manjeet Negeen has written a book about the work done for ikdarnathapada and its reconstruction in 2013, 5 years ago
 kitaab kaa naam he "kedarnath se saakshaatkaar" jiskaa vimochan uttarakhand ke pehle inwestors summit main desh ke grahamantrirajnath sinhaur uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ne kiya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said in the book's best wishes that Jeevat is a readable compilation of journalism
 kitaab ke bare main jane-maane lekhak amish treepathi ne kaha he ki main sachcha shiv bhakt hum or aapako yah kitaab jarur padhani chahie
 Noted filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar has also given his reaction about the book
 paanch saal pehle kedarnath main ai baadh kabhi na bhuulane vaali ghatana he
 Manjit Negi has compiled a book titled 'interview to Kedarnath' to see and cover this destructive nature of nature and the subsequent Bhagiratha effort to return Kedarghati to its divine and magnificent form
 ek tivi patrkaar hone ke naate unhone is aapadaa ko cover kiya or pichley paanch saal main aapadaa or punarnirmaan ke dauraan bhi vah kai baar kedarnath gaye
 According to the author, it took 5 years to write the book, when June 2013 saw the disaster and lived for weeks in the area
 jab log kedarnath traasadee ke baad us ilaake se nikal bhaagane ke liye har jugat laga rahe the, bhagwaan se dua maang rahe the, main usee ilaake main jane ke liye ji jaan laga rahaa tha, ye meraa pesha tha, meraa junun
 My love for my motherland Uttarakhand
 maine traasadee ko jiya
 The author has explained in detail when and how the idea of writing this book came to his mind
 bakaul lekhak manajit negi, 'ek khyaal mere dimag main hameshaa rahaa ki maut ke tandav ko itane najadik se dekhne ke baad mujhe ise kalambaddh jarur karnaa chahie lekin in 5 varshon main patrakarita ke peshey kii bhagdaud main samay nikalataa hi rahaa
 When the efforts to save the valley started after the tragedy and saw the copes erupting, it seemed that not only should the demolition be told, but also the story of reconstruction
 'lekhak ne bataaya, is punarnirmaan ke kaam ko safal banane main karnal ajay kothial or unki team kaa ahm yogadan rahaa he
 His team continued the rebuilding work every season
 saath hi sarkaar ne bhi apni ore se koi kor kasar nahin chodi jisase ki yahaan kaa punarnirmaan kaa kaam itani jaldi samaapt hone vaala he
 After becoming Prime Minister, Narendra Modi prepared a master plan to rebuild Kedarnath

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is appearing in a different style before the Gujarat elections and now
 rahul gandhi ne aakraamak campan kiya, bijepi ko kadi takkar di
 But the way Rahul is lovingly targeting Modi even after the defeat in Gujarat
 isse dekhakar man main sawaal uthne laga ki kya congress badal rahi he yaa phir paanchavin peedi kaa andaaj bhar he
 The question is also another whether after three and a half years, Modi's style is creating monotony and now the public-media style of Korahulka started to look good
 lekin isse hoga kya, or corban copy ko janata kyon chunegi
 That is, the carbon copy can compete with the original, but it cannot be original
 rahul gandhi ke saamne sabase bada sankat yahi he ki modi virodh kaa rahul tarika modi style he
 The way to oppose policies is to cash in on public anger against Modi
 karpshan virodh kaa tarika janvirohi tehraane kii jagah jawaab maangane kaa he
 That is, Narendra Modi is at the center of Rahul's politics and Rahul Raj is at the center of Congress politics, then the people have said and where are the questions of the public
 rahul gandhiko apni haar main jeet dikhnaa hi sahi he, kyonki pehali baar gujarat main congress ke achche parformens ne vipaksh main josh bhar diya he
 The opposition will now fight more strongly against Narendra Modi
 aage rahul gandhi gujarat vaale apane chunavi model par hi chal sakate hai
 Other parties of the opposition may also be forced to consider Rahul Gandhi as the leader
 lekin ye bhi karnataka, empi, rajasthan, chhattisgarh ke parformens par nirbhar karata he
 Because the question of credibility will also arise on Rahul Gandhi, despite good performance in Gujarat
 pichley 5 saalon main rahul gandhi ke pramukh chehre ke saath congress record tod 27 chunaav haari he
 Looking at this track record, the question is if the trio of Gujarat had no support, would Rahul Gandhi have been able to reach the Congress number 80 as well

 ' pradhanmantri narendra modi par dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate hue congress ne ravivaar ko bada hamalaa bolaa
 Senior Congress leader and general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad said that it is good that Prime Minister Modi mentioned Raksha Bandhan in 'mann Ki Baat'
 desh main 15-20 karod musalmaan bhi rahete hai or ramadan chal rahaa he
 The PM would also mention that they would celebrate Eid together
 phir diwali aegi to mil kar diwali naaenge
 If Christmas comes, we will celebrate Christmas
 lekin piem sirf chuninda hokar dhruvikaran karnaa chaahate hai
 Azad was referring to what was said in Prime Minister Modi's Mann Ki Baat program, in which Modi was giving gifts to women laborers who wash kitchen or work in fields on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
 
 azaad kaa kahana he ki ye desh kii samskruti main he ki hindu bahan musalmaan bhaaiyon ko bhi raakhi baandhti hai
 But it suits Modi's politics that they should talk about just one religion
 congress ne piem modi ke 'man kii baat' kaarykram main kahi gai baton kaa chun- chun kar jawaab diya
 Describing Modi as a dream dealer, Azad said that he has been selling dreams since six months before the election
 itane sapane beche ke log din main bhi sapane dekhne lage ki jab modi pradhanmantri banenge to unke saare sapane puure ho jaaegein
 Dreams have not been fulfilled and Modi is still engaged in selling dreams, whereas the dream is to fulfill the dreams made earlier than the public

 The Congress selectively responded to what was said in PM Modi's 'mann Ki Baat' program
