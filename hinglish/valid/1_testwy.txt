 In linguistics, 'syllable' or syllable is an organized unit of sounds
 kisi bhi shabd ko anshon main todakar bolaa ja saktaa he or shabdaansh shabd ke vah ansh hote hai jinhen or zyaada chota nahin banaaya ja saktaa varanaa shabd kii dhvaniyaan badal jaati hai
 For example, the word 'suddenly' has three syllables - 'A', 'cha' and 'naq'
 yadi ruk-ruk kar 'a-chaa-nak' bolaa jaye to shabd ke teenon shabdaansh khandit rup se dekhe ja sakate hai lekin shabd kaa uccharan sunne main sahi prathit hota he
 If 'nak' is broken further, the sounds of the word become wrong - 'a-cha-na-k'
 This word is also not called 'a-chan-k' because it also makes the pronunciation wrong
 kuch chote shabdon main ek hi shabdaansh hota he, jaise 'main', 'kaan', 'haath', 'chal' or 'ja'
 kuch shabdon main do shabdaansh hote hai, jaise 'chalakar', khaanaa, rumal or sabzi 
 Some have three or more syllables, such as 'important' and 'international'
 akshar shabd kaa arth he - 'jo na ghat sake, na nasht ho sake'
 It was earlier used for 'speech' or 'speech' and for syllable
 'varna' ke liye bhi akshar kaa prayog kiya jaataa rahaa
 This is the reason that the word 'letter' is also commonly used today for the characters expressed by script signs
 bhashaa ke vaigyanik adhyayan ne akshar ko angreji 'silabal' kaa arth pradaan kar diya he, jisamen swar, swar tathaa vyanjan, anuswaar sahit swar yaa vyanjan dhvaniyaan sammilit maani jaati hai
 a unit of sound or sound community spoken in the same stroke or force is called akshara
 ikai kii pruthakta kaa aadhaar swar yaa swararat vyanjan hota he
 The consonant sound comes as a part of the vowel in an accent or on the ante
 astu, akshar main swar hi merudand he
 Neither a vowel can be separated from a vowel, nor is a vowel formed without vowels or vowel consonants
 uccharan main yadi vyanjan moti kii tarah he to swar dhaage kii tarah
 If the voice is a strong emperor then the consonant is the king
 isi aadhaar par praayah akshar ko swar kaa paryaay maan liya jaataa he, kintu aisa he nahin, phir bhi akshar nirmaan main swar kaa atyadhik mahatv hota he
 Consonant sounds in some languages also help in letter formation
 angreji bhashaa main na, r, l jaisi vyanjan dhvaniyaan swararat bhi uccharit hoti hai evam swardhvani ke samaan akshar nirmaan main sahaayak siddh hoti hai
 Akshar word is used in Hindi for English Syllable
 dow ramvilas sharma ne silabal ke liye 'swarik' shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 
 chunki akshar shabd kaa bhashaa or vyakaran ke itihaas main anek arthchhaya ke liye prayog kiya gaya he, isliye silabal ke arth main iske prayog se bhramasrijan kii ashanka rahati he
 In the pronunciation of a word, the sound which has peak or height is the same letter or syllable, as on the sound in the hand
 is shabd main ek akshar he
 The word 'unimaginative' has three letters - A, Kal, Pit; Three - come to freedom; That is, where there is a separation of the pronunciation of the vowel in the word, there is a separation of the letter
 dhwani utpaadan kii drushti se vichaar karne par phuffus sanchalan kii ikai ko akshar yaa swarik kehete hai, jisamen ek hi sheershadhvani hoti he
 From the point of view of anatomy, the letter or vocal can also be called pleural pulsation, which is pronounced in the sound system
 jab dhwani khand yaa alpatam dhwani samooh ke uccharan ke samay avyav sanchalan akshar main ucchtam ho to vah dhwani aksharvat hoti he
 Vowel sounds are often pronounced syllable and consonant sounds are pronounced
 shabdagat uccharan kii nitant pruthak ikai ko akshar kaha jaataa he, yatha The number of letters in a word does not depend on how many sounds it contains, but rather on how much shock or shock the word is pronounced, ie how many disjoint sound units are in the word
 akshar main prayukt sheersh dhwani ke atirikt shesh dhvaniyon ko 'akshrang' yaa 'gahvar dhwani' kaha jaataa he
 For example, 'char' has a letter which has aa vertex and f and r sound
 kisi bhi shabdaansh main ek 'shabdaansh centre' hota he, jo hameshaa swar varna hi hota he or uske ird-gird anya varna milte hai jo vyanjan bhi ho sakate hai or swar bhi
 'kaan' shabdaansh kaa shabdaansh centre 'aa' kaa swar he jisase pehle 'k' or baad main 'na' ke varna aate hai

 This nature lover who has a deep affection for nature is the only person who wrote the national anthem for two countries

 In this, the voices of doubt, fascination, fatigue and despair of the era are revealed
 manushya or ishwar ke bich jo chirsthayee sampark he unki rachanaaon main vah alag-alag roopon main ubharkar saamne aayaa
 Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi always had ideological differences about nationality and humanity
 jahaan gandhi pehle paaydaan par rashtrawaad ko rakhte the, vahiin tagore maanavtaa ko rashtrawaad se adhik mahatv dete the
 But both respected each other very much

 The word law itself seems to be a word associated with the creator
 aadhyatmik jagat main 'vidhi ke vidhaan' kaa aashay 'vidhaataa dwaara banaaye hue kanoon' se he
 It is a law made by the life and death creator or can be called the law of law
 saamaanya rup se vidhaataa kaa kanoon, prakruti kaa kanoon, jeev-jagat kaa kanoon evam samaaj kaa kanoon
 Today the whole world is being affected by the state-made law
 raajnneeti aaj samaaj kaa anivaary ang ho gaya he
 Every organism of the society is governed by laws
 aaj samaaj main bhi vidhi ke shashan ke naam par duniya bhar main sarkarein nagarikon ke liye vidhi kaa nirmaan karti he
 The purpose of law is to regulate the conduct of society
 adhikaar evam dayitvon ke liye spasht vyakhya karnaa bhi he saath hi samaaj main ho rahe anaikatik kaary yaa lokaneeti ke viruddh hone vaale kaaryo ko aparaadh ghoshit karke aparaadhiyon main bhay paidaa karnaa bhi aparaadh vidhi kaa udeshy he
 From 1945 till today, the United Nations, through its charter or through its various relevant organizations, tried to tell the states and citizens of the world that development of society is not possible without peace but co-existence for peace and It is important not only to have a fair attitude but also to revive the conduct
 nyaaypurna samaaj main hi shanti, sadbhaav, maitri, sashastitv kaayam ho paata he
 Law means the code of rules, instructions, restrictions and entitlements governing and governing human behavior
 lekin yah bhoomika to naitik, dharmik or anya saamaajik samhitaon kii bhi hoti he
 Actually, the law differs from these codes in many ways
 pehali baat to yah he ki kanoon sarkaar dwaara banaaya jaataa he lekin samaaj main use sabhi ke upar samaan rup se lagu kiya jaataa he
 Secondly, by taking the form of 'will of the state', it takes precedence over all other social norms and standards
 tisare, kanoon anivaary hota he arthath nagarikon ko uske paalan karne ke chunaav kii swatantraaa nahin hoti
 There is a provision of punishment in law for those who do not follow
 lekin, kanoon keval dand hi nahin detaa
 It also provides rules for contracting between individuals or parties, marriage, succession, distribution of benefits and governing institutions
 kanoon sthapit saamaajik naitiktaaon kii pushti kii bhoomika bhi nibhaataa he
 Fourthly, the law is 'public' in nature because it is designed as a code of published and recognized rules through formal legislative procedures
 ant main kanoon main apane anupaalan kii ek naitik baadhyataa nihit he jiske tahat ve log bhi kanoon kaa paalan karne ke liye majaboor hote hai jinhen vah anyaaypurna lagata he
 The political system, whether democratic or totalitarian, has to run on the basis of some code of law
 lekin, loktantric vyavasthaaon main badalte samay ke saath apraasangik ho gayi yaa nyaaypurna na samajhe jane vaale kanoon ko radd karne or uski jagah nayaa behatar kanoon banane kii maang karne kaa adhikaar hota he
 a notable role of law is also believed to be to educate citizens to run the society in an organized style
 shuruyaat main raajnneetishastra ke centre main kanoon kaa adhyayan hi tha
 Political philosophers have been embroiled in intense debates over the question of the essence and structure of law
 kanoon ke vidwaanon ko maanavshaastra, raajnneetik arthshaastra, natikshastra or vidhaayi mulya-pranali kaa adhyayan bhi karnaa padataa he
 The notion of 'rule of law' prevails in liberal democracies operating on a constitutional basis
 in vyavasthaaon main kanoon ke daayre ke baahar koi kaam nahin karata, na vyakti or na hi sarkaar
 Behind this is the liberal principle of law according to which the purpose of law is not to impose restrictions on the person but to guarantee his freedom
 udaarataavaadi siddhant maanata he ki kanoon ke bina vyaktigat aacharan ko sanyamit karnaa naammumkin ho jayega or ek ke adhikaron ko duusare ke haathon hanan se bachaaya nahin ja sakegaa
 Thus in the language of John Locke, law means the law to protect life, liberty and property
 udaarataavaadi siddhant spasht karata he ki kanoon ke banane or lagu karne ke tareeke koun-koun se hone chahie
 For example, the law should be made through mutual consultation by elected lawmakers
 duusare, koi kanoon pichhali tarikh se lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki us surat main vah nagarikon ko un kaamon ke liye dandit karegaa jo tatkaaleen kanoon ke mutabik kiye gayi the
 Similarly, liberal law is against the punishment of cruel and inhuman kind
 raajnneetik prabhaavon se nirpeksh rahane vaali ek nishpaksh nyaaypalika kii sthapana kii jaati he taaki kanoon kii vyavasthit vyakhya karte hue pakshakaron ke bich uske aadhaar par faisalaa ho sake
 Marxists believe that the concept of rule of law works in the name of guaranteeing individual freedom while protecting property rights and protecting the capitalist system
 iskaa nateeja saamaajik vishmata or vargeey prabhutv ko banaaye rakhane main nikalataa he
 Marx considers law like politics and ideology to be part of a superstructure or superstructure whose base or basis is laid on the method of capitalist production
 nariwadiyon ne bhi kanoon ke shashan kii avadharana kii aalochana kii he ki vah langik nishpakshta par aadhaarit nahin he
 That is why the judiciary and the profession of law are occupied by men
 bahusamskritwad ke pairokaron kaa tark he ki kanoon asal main prabhutvshaalee saanskrithik samoohon ke mulyon or ravaiyon kii numaaindgi hi karata he
 As a result, the values and concerns of minority and marginalized groups continue to be ignored
 kanoon or naitikta ke bich antar ke sawaal par darshanik shuru se hi sir khapate rahe hai
 The basis of law is the belief of those who believe in the moral system, in the principle of 'natural law'
 plato or unke baad arestu kii manyata thi ki kanoon or naitikta main nazadiiki rishta hota he
 a just society can only be one in which the laws affirm wisdom based on moral rules
 madhyayugin isai vichaarak thomas equina bhi maanate the ki is dharti par uttam jivan vyateet karne ke liye natural lau yani ishwar pradutt naitiktaaon ke mutabik kanoon hone chahie
 In the nineteenth century, the theory of natural law became ineffective as the prestige of rationalism and scientific outlook increased
 kanoon ko naitik, dharmik or rahasywaadee manyataon se mukt karne kii koshishen huin
 John Austin established 'legal positivism' which claimed that the law was concerned not with a higher moral or religious principle, but with a sovereign person or institution
 kanoon isliye kanoon he ki uskaa paalan karavaaya jaataa he or karnaa padataa he
 HLA is a far more practical and naive interpretation of legal positivism
 Hart's work is found in 'the Concept of Law'
 heart kanoon ko naitik niyamon ke daayre se nikaal kar maanav samaaj ke sandarbh main paribhaashit karte hai
 According to him, law is a combination of first and secondary rules
 pratham shrenee ke niyamon ko 'kanoon ke saar' kii sangya dete hue heart kehete hai ki unka sambandh saamaajik vyavhaar ke viniman se he
 Like, foreclosure law
 dwitiya shrenee ke niyam sarkari sansthaaon ko hidaayat dete hai ki kanoon kis tarah banaaya jaae, unka kis tarah karyanvayan kiya jaae, kis tarah uske aadhaar par faisale kiye jaaen or in aadhaaron par kis tarah uski vaidhata sthapit kii jaae
 The theory of legal positivism propounded by Hart has been criticized by political philosopher Ronold Dwarkin
 unke anusaar kanoon keval niyamon kii samhita hi nahin hota or na hi aadhunik vidhi pranaliyaan kanoon kii vaidhata sthapit karne ke liye kisi ek samaan tareeke kaa praavdhaan karti hai
 The debate between the law and morality also arose in the Nuremberg lawsuit punishing the atrocities of the Nazis
 prashn yah tha ki kya un kaamon ko aparaadh tehraaya ja saktaa he jo rashtriya kanoon ke mutabik kiye gayi hon? iske jawaab ke liye prakritik kanoon kii avadharana kaa sahaara liya gaya, lekin uski abhivyakti maanavadhikaron kii bhashaa main hui
 Indeed, the question of the relationship between law and morality is highly complex and continues to arise in the context of issues such as abortion, prostitution, pornography, violence in TV and films, mother-of-the-womb, and genetic engineering

 Vincent and the Grenadines and a total of 15 countries, including the United Kingdom
 vartmaan satta-vidyaman shaasha, 6 farvari varsh 1952 se maharani elizabeth dwitiya hai
 The political system of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, like other Commonwealth countries, is based on the Westminster system, in which the title of head of state is nominal, and the real administrative powers are vested at the head of state

 jo purv upnivesh, british shaasha ko aaj bhi apana shaasha maanate he, un deshon ko rashtramandal prajabhumi yaa rashtramandal pradesh kaha jaataa he
 As the prominent parallel heads of many of these nations, the British academies also find themselves with the title of head of the Commonwealth

 Generally, individuals from the UK to whom His / Her Majesty or His / Her Royal Highness is referred to are generally considered members of the royal family
 rajpariwaar main keval samprabhu ko hi sanvaidhanik kartavya va pad praapt hai
 The sovereign and his immediate family members carry out various official, ceremonial and representational functions of the country

 The bill received royal assent on 23 April 2013, and came into force on March 2015 after the passage of the relevant legislation in all Commonwealth territories

 It is a Latin language word and used to mean "cloud", the plural meaning "nebulai", "nebulay" or "nebulis"
 is baat ke pramaan uplabdh hai ki doorabeen ke avishkaar ke pehle se maaya logon ko niharikaon ke bare main pataa tha
 a folklore pertaining to the area of the sky surrounding the deer constellation supports this theory
 kahani main ullekh he ki dadhakati aag ke aasapaas ek dhabba he
 Around 150 CE, Claudius Ptolemy mentions five stars appearing in nebulae in issue VII-VIII of his book Almagest
 unhone saptarshi taramandal main ek badalon se yukt yaa dhundhale kshetra kaa bhi ullekh kiya tha, jo kisi bhi taare ke saath nahin judaa tha
 Unlike the galaxies, the first real nebula was mentioned by the Persian astronomer Abd al-rahman al-sufi in his "situated Star Book"
 unhone andromeeda gallexi ke sthaan par "ek chota badal" dekha tha
 He characterized the Omricran Velorum constellation Punj as a "nebulous star" or obscure star and other obscure objects in Bruchi's cluster

 In 1618 John the Baptist Cyst also studied this nebula

 In 1715, Edmund Halley published a list of six nebulae
 Throughout the century, the number continued to increase, with the compilation of a list of 20 released in 1746 by Jean Philippe de Chasaux
 Nicolas Louis de Lacale listed 42 nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope in 1751–53
 Most of which were previously unknown
 iske baad charles mesier ne 1781 tak 103 niharikaon kii suchi banaai, haalanki unke aisa karne kii pramukh vajah thi - dhoomaketuon kii galat pahchaan se bachanaa
 Subsequently, the efforts of William Herschel and his sister Caroline Herschel increased the number of nebulae
 unki kaitalong of van thaujend new nebylai and cluster of stars 1786 main prakashit hui
 ek hajaar kii duusari suchi 1789 main or 510 kii teesri tathaa antim suchi 1802 main prakashit kii gayi thi
 Throughout much of his work, William Herschel was convinced that these nebulae were mere underdeveloped stars

 In early 1864, William Huggins investigated the spectra or range of about 70 nebulae
 They found that about a third of them had a wide range of gas inclusions
 baaki main ek satat vistrut shrenee dikhaai di or inhen sitaron kaa ek samooh mana gaya
 In 1912, a third category was added when Vesto Slifer demonstrated that the nebulae around the Meropee star resembled the Pleiades open starfish
 is prakaar niharika taron ke prativimvit prakaash dwaara chamakta he
 Slifer and Edwin Hubble continued to collect a wide range of these from several diffused nebulae and discovered that 29 of these showed emission spectra and 33 had continuous spectra of starlight
 1922 main habal ne ghoshnaa kii ki lagbhag sabhi niharikaayen sitaron se judy hai or unki roshni taron ke prakaash se aati he
 They also discovered that nebulae in the emission spectrum are almost always warmer than B1 or more, whereas nebulae with continuous spectra appear with relatively cold stars

 Dark or dark nebulae are the same as diffuse nebulae, but they cannot be seen by the light emitted or reflected by them
 Instead, they are seen as dark clouds in front of distant stars or emission nebulae
 haalanki ye niharikaayen prakaash tarangon par alag-alag dikhaai detii hai, par ve sabhi infrared yaa avarakt taragon par utsarjan ke ujjwal strot hai
 This emission mainly comes from the dust inside the nebulae

 adhiprachaar un samast soochnaaon ko kehete hai jo koi vyakti yaa sanstha kisi bade jan samudaay kii raay or vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne ke liye sanchaarit karti he
 The most effective propaganda is one whose content is often completely true, but it may also contain a small amount of false, half-truth or logical fallacy
 adhiprachaar ke bahut se tareeke hai
 The purpose of propaganda is to influence people's behavior and opinions rather than giving information
 propaganda kaa hindi main shabdic arth he prachaar, adhiprachaar athwa mat-prachaar
 Propaganda is done to propagate an idea and point of view, for a particular purpose, especially under a political purpose
 lekin isaki buniyaad aam taur par satya par nahin tiki hoti
 Propaganda began as a henchman to morally defeat the enemy's army during the war
 iske baad zikr miltaa he ki 1622 main pandrahawein pope gregory ne vatican main protestant sudhaaron ke kilaaf propaganda kaa kaam sanbhaala tha
 Propaganda's image became negative when the British government systematically propagated its letter of political interests during World War I
 kalantar main iskaa upyog chunaav-prachaar ke liye bhi hone laga
 Initially, it was used during political campaigns to garner support for the candidate's interest
 tatpashchaat isaki upyogita samajhate hue iskaa vistaar hua or ise vigyaapan kaa bhi ang bana liya gaya
 Propaganda also had a positive side when it came to advertising
 vah bhaawanaaon ko sparsh karne vaale ek sukhad ehsaas ke vaahak kii bhoomika nibhaane laga or ek khaas sandarbh main rachanaatmak ho gaya
 The basis of information provided by Propaganda has always been negative rather than historically positive
 iske madhyam se di jane vaali jaankaree praayah ek tarfaa or bhraamak prakruti kii hoti he
 Propaganda was used to promote a particular viewpoint for political reasons
 aaj propaganda kaa falak kaafii vyapak ho gaya he or iskaa upyog jaan-boojh kar kisi vyakti, sanstha, raashtra, utpaada athwa kisi raajnneetik party ke bare main nakaaratmak soochna failaane ke liye kiya jane laga he
 The other side of propaganda is that it is also seen as a special type of message
 ek aise sandesh ke rup main jise kisi vishesh samskruti, darshan, vichaar athwa mat ko kisi naare aadi ke madhyam se bazaar or samaaj main prachlit karne ke liye kiya prachaarit jaataa he
 Propaganda has been used to prove lies to be true during war
 america is propaganda kaa sabase bada prayokta mana jaataa he
 He always spreads the news during the war that he is fighting to protect humanity and fight terrorism, when his motive is something else
 iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan pichley do dashakon main hue iraq or afghanistan ke yudhon main dekhne ko mila
 The US has always maintained that it was necessary to fight terrorism, while the fact was that it was carrying an army of journalists who were on its side or who had been bought, along with its soldiers
 ye patrkaar apni khabaron ko live dikhaane ke naam par aisi jaankaree kaa prasaaran karte rahe jo sach nahin thi
 Such journalism itself is called jaded journalism or embedded journalism
 is tarah kii patrakarita main ek paksh kii ichha ke anusaar reporting kii jaati he or sach ko gaayab kar diya jaataa he
 Many times this journalism is also used by political parties to create public opinion in their favor
 kuch sanchaarshastriyon kii manyata he ki propaganda kaa udbhav jan-sanchaar madhyamon ke vikaas ke baad hua
 They consider it as part of communication that communication to attract public opinion is a form of propaganda
 yahan sanchaar or propegande ke sambandh par gaur karnaa zaruri he
 The invention of radio in the early twentieth century gave Propaganda a special boom
 radio ke madhyam se kaafii kam samay main ek vyapak jan-samooh tak apni baat ko pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 The development of radio not only worked to spread self-motivated and sponsored information, but it also originated the advertisement whose developed forms are in front of us in various forms today
 radio ke vikaas ke pehle itane kam samay main ek vyapak jan-samooh tak sidhe-taur par apni baat pahunchaa paanaa asambhav sa tha
 It is of course that information could also be communicated directly through the print medium, but the readers of newspapers were few
 pathak banane ke saath sakshartaa kii shart bhi judi hui thi
 Radio unveiled a new world of advertising where reading ability was not necessary
 isse vigyaapan kii pahunch or prabhaav kaa dayera aseemit ho gaya
 Along with advertising, political propaganda also expanded very rapidly
 radio ke baad propaganda ko tivi ke aagaman ne ek or nayaa oochaal diya
 TV was not able to overthrow radio, but its credibility was more authentic than radio
 badi-badi companiyon ne jab apane utpaadon ko badha-chadha kar pesh kiya to logon ne us prachaar main apni chhavi dekhni shuru kar di
 That is why advertising guru Alec Padmasi once said that when people of India become customers of something, they become less than logic and more than emotion
 unhone liril sabun ke vigyaapan kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki ‘aapako kya lagata he yah jo ladki bikni pahanakar jharne main nahaati he or neembu kii khushboo ke ehsaas jaisi tarotaza mahasoos karti he, to vah kya sachmuch vaastavik bharat ke gaanvon or shaharon main sambhav he? jahaan ek baaltee pani dhang se nahaane ke liye naseeb hota, vahaan vah neembu kii khushboo vaale ehsaas kaa anubhav kaise ho saktaa he?’ isi aadhaar par padmasi kehete hai ki vigyaapan propaganda ke madhyam se upabhokta ke saamne ek aisi chhavi nirmit kar detaa he jisamen upabhokta apni chhavi dekhne lagate hai
 In recent years, the invention of the Internet and e-mail gave Propaganda a global expansion
 masalan web-madhyamon main vah takat he jo sthaneey mudde ko vaishvik mudda bana sakati he
 Web-mediums have violated all the boundaries of geography and transformed the entire world into a small village
 kshan bhar main local se global ho jane ke liye logon ne internet pranali kaa jam kar laabh uthaaya he
 The most powerful example of how a local singer and local music has become the most popular music via the Internet in a short time is the song called Kolaberry Dee
 marketing kii bhashaa main jise ham viral marketing ke naam se jaanate hai darasal vah media kii bhashaa main propaganda hi he
 On the one hand propaganda is seen as a medium to present negative things in a positive way and on the other hand propaganda is a skill of propaganda in which a subject is presented in such a way that people are attracted towards it
 Go sambandhit vishay ko ek aisi bhashaa, lay or sangeet ke madhyam se prastut kiya jaae ki aam upabhokta apnaapan mahasoos karke us utpaada ke saath jud jaataa he
 For this, various media mediums are used
 jaise : television, radio, binar, internet, billboard, ligalet ityadi
 The negative side in this role of giving touch to emotions is only that such propaganda destroys the rationality of man and makes the emotional side more effective in his place
 america ke ek vigyaapan-lekhak tristrian toliver ne propaganda ke bare main kaha he : main hameshaa apane bare main yahi sochataa hoon ki aapako log isliye nahin pasand karte ki aapane kya kiya or unke liye kya kiya
 Rather you are always remembered for what you made them feel through your words
 masalan propaganda main yah baat bahut myne nahin rakhti kii kisi baat ko aapane kitne achche tareeke se rakhaa balki sabase mahatvapurn cheez hoti he usase nikalne vaali vah anubhuti or prerana jo logon par apni chhap chhod jaae
 The pleasant feeling of propaganda has the ability to be remembered for a long time
 is lihaaz se vigyaapan main propaganda kaa istemaal use sirf nakaaratmak na ban kar sakaaratmak rup bhi dene laga he
 According to this aspect Propaganda is the name of an entire process based on the concept of creative nature
 iskaa upyog kis prakaar se kiya janaa he— yah puri tarah upbhogakarta par nirbhar karata he
 Anti-capitalist color french postcard : pratham vishwayuddh ke samay main germany ke wilhem dwitiya ko dharti ko munh se katate hue dikhaaya gaya he

 bhartiya vidvan to is sabhyataa ko anadi parampara aayaa hua maanate hai | pashchimi vidwano ke anusaar aaryon kaa ek samudaay bharat me lagbhag 1500 isvi isa purv aayaa or unke aagaman ke saath hi yah sabhyataa aarambh hui thi
 Generally, most scholars consider the period of Vedic civilization from 1500 BC to 500 AD, but the remains found from new archaeological excavations have found many remains of Vedic civilization, which modern scholars like David Frawley, Telagiri, BB Lal, s r Rao, Subhash Kak, Aurobindo have started to believe that Vedic civilization started in India itself and the Rigveda was composed in the Sunga period, kyonki aaryo ke bharat me aane kaa na to koi puraatatva utkhanno se pramaan mila he or na hi di en e anusandhano se koi pramaan mila he is kaal main vartmaan hindu dharm ke swaroop kii neenv padi thi jo aaj bhi astitv main he
 Apart from Vedas, many other Sanskrit texts were also composed during this period
 vedangsutron kii rachana mantra brahmangranth or upanishad in vedikigranthon ko vyavasthit karne me hua he | anantar ramayana, mahabharat,or puranonki rachana hua jo is kaal ke gyanapradaayi strot managaya hai

 itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki arya mukhyatah uttari bharat ke maidani ilaakon main rahete the is kaaran arya sabhyataa kaa kendra mukhyatah uttari bharat tha
 During this period, northern India was divided into several Mahajanapadas
 vaidic sabhyataa kaa naam aisa is liye padaa ki veda us kaal kii jaankaree kaa pramukh strot hai
 The Veda is four - Rigveda, Samaveda, Atharvaveda and Yajurveda
 inamen se rugveda kii rachana sabase pehle hui thi
 There is Gayatri Mantra in the Rigveda itself which is dedicated to Savita
 rugveda ke kaal nirdhaaran main vidwaan ekamat nahin he
 Max Müller first attempted to determine the Vedas
 usne buddha dharm se peeche kii ore chalate hue vaidic sahitya ke teen granthon kii rachana ko manamaane dhang se 200-200 varshon kaa samay diya or is tarah rugveda ke rachana kaal ko 1200 isa purv ke kareeb maan liya par nishchit rup se uske aankalan kaa koi aadhaar nahin tha
 The Vedic period can be mainly divided into two parts - the Rigvedic period and the post-vedic period
 rigvaidic kaal aaryon ke aagaman ke turant baad kaa kaal tha jisamen karmkand gaun the par uttaravaidic kaal main hindu dharm main karmkaandon kii pramukhataa bad gai
 The date of this period has been as controversial as the exact information about the people of this period
 iskaa ek pramukh kaaran yah bhi he ki is samay tak keval isi granth kii rachana hui thi
 According to Max Muller, Arya's original residence is Middle Asia
 aaryo dwaara nirmit sabhyataa vaidic kaal kahalaai
 The civilization developed by the Aryans was called the rural civilization
 aaryon kii bhashaa sanskrit thi
 When Max Müller speculated that it started from 1200 BCE, his contemporary scholar W
V
 It was criticized by D
 Whitney
 uske baad maiks mular ne sweekaar kiya tha ki " prithvi par koi aisi shakti nahin he jo nishchit rup se bataa sake ki vaidic mantron kii rachana 1000 isa purv main hui thi yaa ki 1500 isapurv main yaa 2000 yaa 3000 "
 It is believed that a group of Aryans went towards Iran and Europe in addition to India
 irani bhashaa ke pracheenatam granth avesta kii sukhtiyaan rugveda se milti julati hai
 If we look at this linguistic analogy, the Rigveda's creation date is 1000 BC
 lekin bogaaj-koi main paae gaye 1400 isa purv ke abhilekh main hindu devataaon ind, mitravarun, naasatya ityadi ko dekhte hue iskaa kaal or peeche mana ja saktaa he

 vaidic mantron tathaa samhitaon ko brahm kaha gaya he | vahi brahm kaa vistaritrupako brahman kaha gaya he
 Aitareya, Shatapath, Panchavish, Taittariya etc
 are very important in the ancient Brahmin

 inhen upanishdon se yah spasht hota he ki aaryon kaa darshan vishwa ke anya sabhy deshon ke darshan se sarvottam tathaa adhik aage tha
 The living examples of the spiritual development of the Aryans, the oldest religious system and thinking are found in these Upanishads
 upanishdon kii rachana sambhawatah buddha ke kaal main hui, kyonki bhautik ichchhaaon par sarvapratham aadhyatmik unnati kii mahatta sthapit karne kaa prayaas buddha or jain dharmon ke vikaas kii pratikriya ke falswaroop hua
 Later, six disciplines for Vedic studies were born which are called 'vedang'
 vedang kaa shabdic arth he vedon kaa ang, tathaapi is sahitya ke paurushey hone ke kaaran shruti sahitya se pruthak hi gina jaataa he
 Vedang is also called Smriti, because it is considered to be the work of humans

 Number of vedang is 6 sutara sahitya vaidic sahitya kaa ang he
 It is also helpful to understand him

 Reid declined Franklin's request to marry her daughter
 jab franklin landan main the, unki yatra lambi khinch gai or sar wiliam ke samarthan karne ke vaadon se sambandhit samasyaayein utpann ho gai
 Perhaps due to the circumstances created by this delay, Deborah married a man named John Rogers
 This proved to be a sad decision

 Any scope for reconciliation between them ended when William Franklin became the leader of The Board of Associated Loyalists - a paramilitary organization headquartered in British-occupied New York City, which, among other things, New Jersey, southern Connecticut and In counties north of New York City, raids ravaged
 In the initial negotiations for peace with Britain in 1782 "


 Franklin insisted that the Loyalists, who took up arms against the United States, would be excluded from this plea
 They were undoubtedly thinking of William Franklin

 His inventions also include social innovations, such as Paying Forward
 Franklin's fascination in making new developments can be seen as philanthropy; He has written that his scientific works should be used for increasing efficiency and human improvement
 One such improvement was an attempt to speed up the news services through its printing press

 1768 main, postmaster general ke rup main franklin england gaye or vahaan unhone seemaa ke aupniveshik board dwaara ek jigyaasu shikaayat suni: ek ausat vyapaaree jahaaj ko newport, road island pahunchane main lagane vaale samay kii tulana main british mail jahaaj ko england se neuyork pahunchane main kuch hafte zyada kyon lagate hai, iske baavjood ki vyapaaree jahaaj landan se chhot kar thames ke baad english channel se hote hue baad main atlantic paar karte hai, jabaki packet cornwall main phalmouth se sidhe sagar main pahunchate hai? uljhan main pade franklin ne apane chachere bhai timothy folgar ko, jo ek nantaket whaler captain tha or us samay landan main tha, raat ke khaane par aamantrit kiya
 Folger told him that merchant ships routinely avoid the Gulf Stream, while the captain of the mail packet drifted straight into it, even when American whalers told him they were going in a three mph stream 
 franklin ne folgar or anya anbhavi jahaaj captainon ke saath kaam kiya or unhone gulf stream kaa nakshaa banaaya or use jo naam diya vah aaj bhi prayog ho rahaa he
 It took years for British sea captains to cross that stream according to Franklin's advice, but when they could, they saved two weeks in travel time
 Franklin's Gulf Stream chart was published in England in 1770, where it was completely ignored

 In 1743, Franklin founded the American Philosophical Society to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories
 Along with other scientific issues, he started electrical research, which kept him busy for the rest of his life between politics and the period of earning

 He formed a partnership with his foreman, David Hall, who provided Franklin with half the profit of the shop for 18 years

 His discoveries also include his electrical exploration
 franklin kaa prastaav tha ki "vitroes" or "racins" vidyut do alag prakaar ke vidyut drav nahin hai, balki alag-alag dabaavon main ek hi vidyut drav hai
 He was the first person to name them positive and negative respectively, and he was the first to discover the charge conservation principle
 1750 main unhone yah sabit karne ke liye ek prayog kaa prastaav prakashit kiya ki akashiya bijli vidyut he, jiske liye unhone ek patang ko toofaan main udaaya, jo vidyutiya toofaan banane main sakasham prathit hota tha
 On 10 May 1752, France's thomas-françois Dalibird used Franklin's experiment using a 40-foot-long iron rod instead of a kite, and he drew electric sparks from the clouds
 On June 15, Franklin may have performed his famous kite experiment in Philadelphia, and successfully extracted an electric spark from a cloud, although there are theories that suggest he never did the experiment
 Franklin's experiment was not recorded until before the History and Current State of Electricity written by Joseph Priestley in 1767, according to the evidence that Franklin was isolated
 Others, such as Georg Wilhelm Richman of St
 Petersburg, Russia, were killed by electric shock a few months after Franklin's experiment
 apane lekhan main, franklin ingit karte hai ki unhen khatre ke bare main pataa tha or unhone kadakati bijli ke vidyutiya hone kaa pradarshan karne ke liye vaikalpik tareekon ko pesh kiya, jaisaa ki vidyutiya zamin kii avadharana ke unke upyog main dikhaa

 The popular TV program Mythbusters emulated the Franklin experiment with the alleged "key to the end of a thread" and established with a certainty that if Franklin had actually done the experiment in this way, he would have undoubtedly been killed
 Instead, he used the kite to collect the electric charge from a storm cloud, which meant that the lightning was electric
 19 oktober ko, england ko likhe ek patr main, prayog ko dohraane ke liye nirdeshon ke vivaran main franklin ne likhaa: Franklin's electric use led to his invention of the lightning rod
 unhone gaur kiya ki ek chikne bindu ki bajaay dhardaar vaale chaalak khamoshi se niraveshit karne main sakasham the or apekshaakrit adhik duuri se

 Franklin printed Whitefield's sermon on the front page of his gazette
 He arranged for the publication of all of Whitefield's sermons and journals
 Half of Franklin's publications in 1739–41 were from Whitefield, which helped the success of the evangelical movement in America
 Franklin was a lifelong friend and supporter of Whitefield until his death in 1770
 jab unhone carch janaa band kar diya, to franklin ne apni aatmakatha main likhaa: 


 Sunday, being my day of study, i have never lived without religious principles

 Franklin's writings on ethics were condemned by some European authors, such as his important work Portrait of American Culture by Jacob Fugger
 Max Weber considered Franklin's moral writings to be the product of Protestant policies, policies that created the social conditions necessary for the birth of capitalism

 Presbyter Panthi considered him half a Presbyterian and friends considered him an emotional Quaker

 Franklin sought to refine his character by the scheme of thirteen qualities he had developed at the age of 20, and continued to practice some of it throughout the rest of his life
 His autobiography presents his thirteen qualities: franklin ne ek baar main sabhi par kaam karne kii koshish nahin kii
 iske bajaay, ve hafte main ek or keval ek par kaam karte or "baaki anya ko unke saadhaaran maukey par chhod dete
