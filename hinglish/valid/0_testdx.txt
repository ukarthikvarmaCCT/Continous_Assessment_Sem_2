 In the early stages, or with self-realization, architecture takes place in the occupations, or occupations necessary for the limited purposes of humans — often to provide some kind of defense for humans
 kisi jati ke itihaas main vaastukritiyaan mahatvapurn tab hoti hai, jab unamem kisi ansh tak sabhyataa, samruddhi or vilasita aa jaati he or unamem jati ke garv, pratishtha, mahatvakanksha or aadhyatmikta kii prakruti purnataya abhivyakt hoti he
 In ancient times architecture was said to be the mother of all arts
 kintu vritti ke parivartan ke saath or sambhddha vyavsaayon ke bhaag lene par yah samaveshak sangrakshan kii muhar ab nahin rahi
 Architecture is also said to bring to light the social status of the ancient period
 yah vahiin tak thik he jahaan tak saamaajik evam anya uplabdhiyon kaa prabhaav he
 It has also been said that architecture is nothing more than ornamentation of buildings
 jahaan tak aitihaasik vaastukala kaa sambandh he, yah anshat: satya he
 Then architecture is also called the mold of civilization
 jahaan tak puratatviya prabhaav he, yah thik he kintu vaastukala ke itihaas par ek sankshipt drushtipaat se yah spasht ho jayega ki maanav ke pracheenatam prayaas shikariyon ke adikalin gupha-awaason, charavaahon ke charm-tambuon or kisaanon ke jhopadon ke rup main dekh padate hai
 Boat dwellings and tree huts are ancient features

 In these primitive endeavors and in their improved forms, some things are so important and distinctive in all the countries that they are evident even in the greatest art works of a long time later
 yugon ke drut vikascram main vaastukala vikasi, dhali or maanav kii parivartansheel aavashyaktaaon ke - uski suraksha, kaary, dharm, anand or anya yugaprarvatak chihnon, anuroop bani
 The plain form of Egypt, the standard design of China, the exotic and rich nature of India, the majestic majesty of Maya and Aztec of Mexico, the highly developed devotionals of Greece, the complex types of buildings that served the multiple needs of the Roman Empire, the ancient marched churches
 , The Great Gothic Church Building and Chitropam Fort, the excellent configuration and proportions of Turkish buildings and the grand architecture of European revival Numeric monuments present an account of the continuous development of historical architecture
 ye sab imaaraten maanav vikaas ke mahaan yugon kii ore ingit karti hai, jinamein vaastukala jaateey jivan se atyadhik sambandhit hone ke kaaran un jatiyon kii pratibha or mahatvakanksha kaa, jinaki unke smarakon par suspasht chhap hai, digdarshan karaati hai
 The achievements of each historical architecture can be broadly determined by two fundamental principles, one which is embedded in the concept and the other which signifies supreme uniqueness
 misri vaastu main yah yugottarajive vishaal or baari smarakon dwaara vyakt rahasyamyata he, asyrian, babinloni or irani kala main, yah shastrshakti or vilaasi jivan tha, unani kala main yah nishchayatmak aayojana or sanshodhit drushtibhram tha jiske falswaroop saadagi or parishkrut purnataa ai
 It was the love of grandeur, enjoyment and power among the Romans that resulted in a unique scientific creation
 purakalin isaayiyon main yah isamsih kii sachhee saadagi or gaurav vyakt karanevaale girjagharon ke nirmaan ke prati baari utsaah ke rup main tha; gothic nirmaataaon main yah sanrachana yantriki ke gyaan se yukt utkar shakti thi; italvi punaruddhar main yah us yug kii vidvatta thi
 The outstanding quality of Buddhist and Hindu architecture is its metaphysics, which is evident in its development
 musalamaani vaastukala main acolpaneey dhan sampada, thaat or vishaal bhukhand par uskaa prabhutv jhalkata he; jabaki bharat kaa bhimkaay afgani vaastu us shashan kii aakraamak pravriti prakat karata he; kintu mughal smarak utkrisht anupaat mughalon ke or kriti sambandhi prem ko darshane main shreshth hai tathaa bharat kii garmi main unka jivan bhaleebhanti vyakt karte hai
 Thus in the past works we see that the rock, bricks and stones are the only ideas which express the above and reliably, in some way or the other, the religious or other awakening of civilizations that have reached the pinnacle of glory

 In this way we try to build buildings of our era and later these buildings will build caste by encouraging healthy development of body and brain
 iske atirikt ham dekhte hai ki vaastukala kabhi kabhi gyaat upyogita sambandhi aavashyaktaaon or uski nirmaan paddatiyon se aage bhi bad jaati he
 In architecture itself, a pure creation of imagination, when expressed with a wide barrage of all perspectives, is able to reach the pinnacle of perfection, such as Athena with the head of juice in Greece, or the simile of Swayambhu in India
 isamen andeh nahin ki vaastukala kaa aadhaar imaaraten hai, kintu yah imaaraten khadi karne ke atirikt kuch or bhi hai jaise kavita gadhy rachana ke rachana ke atirikt kuch or bhi he
 Poetry is impressive when sung in a sweet tone, but when it is accompanied by appropriate music and rhythmic dance efforts, it not only attracts the human heart and the different senses, but also the whole atmosphere created by their glorious combination
 She makes him aware
 isi prakaar vaastukalpanaayen, darshanik gatividhiyon se, kavyamay abhivyaktiyon se or sammilit layaatmak, sangitatmak tathaa varnatmak arthon se paripurna hoti hai or aisi utkrisht vaastukritiyaan maanav ke antarmanas ko chooti hui sabhi prakaar se uski prashansa kaa paatr hoti hai or phir vishwavyaapee khyaati arjeet karti hai
 This commendation of unanimous great objects is everlasting and inspires future generations
 yah satya he ki vaastukala ke prayogon main bahut asthirataa rahi he, jisase aganit sheliyaan prakat ho gai hai
 But what purpose does any of those styles have? Or what is their relation to his era? The truth is that architecture is neither a creed nor a style, but it is an inexhaustible sequence of development
 isliye vaastu ko shaileyon se vishesh prayojan nahin, jaise badalte hue fishan se kisi mahila kii poshaak kaa koi sambandh nahin
 In this subject, Frank Lloyd Wright has said that the periphery of architecture keeps on moving here and there, its center does not change
 aadhunik vaastukala kaa or vyapak arthon main, vaastukala kaa vikaas vinyas kii sanrachanaatmak aavashyaktaaon or uplabdh saamagree kii saundaryasambhaavnaaon dwaara prastut pratibandhon kii upasthiti main sundarataa ke liye khoj or sangharsh ke falswaroop hua he
 When a creation of a creation results in them, then it seems that today's architecture is a sculpture expressed in the form of heavy compositions and frequencies
 yadi is sandarbh main dekhe to vaastukala vyakti ke apane sarjak man kii sampurna evam suviksit rachana honi chahie, jo swayambhu ke ucch str tak pahunchati he

 The Bhakti movement was an important break in the cultural history of medieval India
 is kaal main saamaajik-dharmik sudhaarkon kii dhara dwaara samaaj vibhinn tarah se bhagwaan kii bhakthi kaa prachaar-prasar kiya gaya
 It was a silent revolution
 yah abhiyaan sikhon ke pehle guru baba nanak dwaara bhartiya up mahadweep main bhagwaan kii puja ke saath jude reeti rivaajon ke liye uttaradaayi tha
 The singing of Gurbani at the gurudwara, all of these originated in the Indian Bhakti movement in medieval history
 bhakthi aandolan kaa armbh dakshin bharat main alwaron evam nayanaron se hua jo kaalaantar main uttar bharat sahit sampoorn dakshin asia main fail gaya
 The leader of this Hindu revolutionary campaign was Shankaracharya, who was a great thinker and a well-known philosopher
 is abhiyaan ko chaitanya mahaprabhu, namdev, tukaraam, jayadev ne or adhik mukharata pradaan kii
 The major achievement of this campaign was the abolition of idol worship
 bhakthi andolan ke netaa ramanand ne ram ko bhagwaan ke rup main lekar ise kendrit kiya
 Very little is known about him, but he is believed to have lived in the first half of the 15th century
 unhone sikhaaya ki bhagwaan ram sarvocch bhagwaan hai or keval unke prati prem or samarpan ke madhyam se tathaa unke pavitra naam ko baar-baar uccharit karne se hi mukti pai jaati he
 Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was a pious Hindu monk and social reformer and took place in Bengal during the sixteenth century
 bhagwaan ke prati prem bhav rakhane ke prabal samarthak, bhakthi yoga ke pravartak, chaitanya ne ishwar kii aradhana shrikrishna ke rup main kii
 Sri Ramanujacharya was an Indian philosopher and has been recognized as the most important Vaishnava saint
 ramanand ne uttar bharat main jo kiya vahi ramanuj ne dakshin bharat main kiya
 He raised his voice against the increasing formalism of orthodox Kuvichar and established a new initiator of Vaishnava ideology based on the foundation of love and dedication
 unka sarvaadhik asaadhaaran yogadan apane maanane waalon ke bich jati ke bhedbhaav ko samaapt karnaa
 The followers of the Bhakti movement in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries include Sant Shiromani Ravidas, Bhagat Namdev and Sant Kabir Das, who emphasized devotional songs of praise to God through their creations
 pratham sikh guru or sikh dharm ke pravartak, guru nanak ji bhi nirgun bhakthi sant the or samaaj sudhaarak the
 He opposed all forms of caste discrimination and religious enmity and customs
 unhone ishwar ke ek rup mana tathaa hindu or muslim dharm kii aupchaariktaaon tathaa reeti rivaajon kii aalochana kii
 Guru Nanak's doctrine was for all people
 unhone har prakaar se samanta kaa samarthan kiya
 Many religious reformers also rose in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
 vaishnav sampradaay ke ram ke anuyaayi tathaa krishna ke anuyaayi anek chote virgon or panthon main bant gaye
 The prominent saint poet among the followers of Rama was Tulsidas
 ve atyant vidwaan the or unhone bhartiya darshan tathaa sahitya kaa gaharaa adhyayan kiya
 His magnum opus 'ramcharitmanas', popularly known as 'tulsikrit Ramayana', is very popular among the Hindu devotees
 unhone logon ke bich shri ram kii chhavi sarvyaapee, sarv shaktimaan, duniya ke swami or parabrahm ke saakaar rup se banaai
 The followers of Krishna founded the Radha Ballabhi Panth under Harivamsa in 1585 AD
 surdaas ne brajabhasha main sur saraagar kii rachana kii, jo shri krishna ke mohak rup tathaa unki premika radha kii kathaon se paripurna he
 Swami Madhwacharya ran a dualistic Vaishnava sect called 'brahmin Sampradaya' towards which people got inclined towards
 iske saath hi dwaitadvaitvaad ke sansthaapak nimbarkacharya ne vishnu ke duusare avatar krishna kii pratishtha vishnu ke sthaan par kii tathaa lakshmi ke sthaan par radha ko rakh kar desh ke purv bhaag main prachlit krishna-radha kii prem kathaon ko naveen rup evam utsaah pradaan kiya
 Vallabhacharya also did the work of spreading Krishna devotion
 jagatprasiddh surdaas bhi is sampradaay kii prasiddhi ke mukhya kaaran kahe ja sakate hai
 Surdas took initiation from Vallabhacharya Ji and presented Krishna's lovelings and child sports in the color of devotion
 maadhuryabhav kii in lilaon ne janata ko bahut rasmagn kiya
 In this way two main sects were present in their time under full devotion, Ram Bhakti Branch; Krishnabhakti Branch
 iske atirikt bhi do shakhaayen prachlit huin - premumarg tathaa nirgunmarg shakha
 Parallel to this development sequence of Sagun Dhara, Muslim Sufi saints who came from outside were also spreading their ideas to the general public
 musalamaanon ke is lambe pravaas ke kaaran bhartiya tathaa muslim samskruti kaa aadan-pradaan hona swaabhaavik tha
 Then these Sufi saints also made a successful attempt to spread their ideas to the masses, to present their opinions in Indian lectures, in the Indian environment, right here
 inke maton main kattarta kaa kahin bhi abhas nahin tha
 His main principle was the element of love
 yadhyapi prem ke madhyam se ishwar ko paane ke liye kiye jane vaale prayaas main kuch antar avashya tha tathaapi inke prem tatva ke pratipaadan evam prasar style ne logon ko aakarshith kiya
 He also propounded monotheism, which some believe to be monotheism, which is not fair
 hazarat nizamuddin chishti, saleem chishti aadi anek santon ne hindu-musalmaan sabakaa aadar praapt kiya
 In this Sufism also four streams mainly ran - jaaysi, qutuban, manzan aadi prasiddh kaviyon ne hindi sahitya ko amuly sahitya ratna bhent kiye
 They also had an impact on the Nirgungyanashrayi Shakti branch and things were said to erase the distinction between Hindu and Muslims
 acharya shukla ne bhi inhen ’hindu or musalmaan hriday ko aamane saamne karke ajanabeepan mitaane vaala' kaha
 Ramanand ji brought Ram bhakti to North India
 unke siddhanton main is bhakthi kaa swaroop do prakaar kaa tha - ram kaa nirgun rup; ram kaa avtari rup
 Both these views were together
 nirgun rup main ram kaa naam to hota par use ’dasharath-sut’ kii katha se sambaddh nahin kiya jaataa
 Ramanand saw that after coming to the shelter of God, there is no bonding of untouchability, caste and caste etc
 Therefore, even after being blessed by Sanskrit pundits and high Brahmin clans, he wrote poetry in the country language and gave everyone the name Ram
 Preached kabir inhen ke shishy the
 Kabir, Raidas, Dhanna, Sena, Pippa etc
 his disciples made this idea famous
 ramanaam ke mantra ko lekar chalane vaale akkhad-fakkad santon ne bhed-bhav bhula kar sabko prempurvak gale lagane kii baat kahi
 Emphasizing the renunciation of obsolescence and external laws by the Vedic rituals, spread the love of Rama name, simple method of remembering with reverence and easy samadhi
 kabir main teen pramukh dharaayen samahit dikhaai detii hai - Hatha Yoga definitely has some effect on them, but the emphasis is mainly on the element of love
 saamaajik sudhaar ke kshetra main in santon kaa mahatvapurn yoga rahaa he
 In the literature of these saints, we get a glimpse of all the social, religious and political situations of the era
 dharmik drushti se bhi inkaa yoga bahut he
 Due to the emphasis on the language of easy love, people also had a lot of inclination on them
 kabir kii mrityu ke kuch samay baad isamen bhi sampradaay kii sthapana ho gai
 Like other branches, its importance is also in making the devotee complete
 ye chaaron shakhaayen bhaktikaal yaa madhyakaal ke purv bhaag main apane utkarsh main thim
 All these four branches gave big personality to Hindi literature such as Sur, Tulsi, Kabir etc
 apane bhakthibhaav kii charam utkrushtataa ke liye bhi ye janata ke man-maanas par aadhipaty kar sake
 Even today they are seen with reverence and respect
 yadhyapi kaalaantar main in sampradaayon main bhi aniatikta ke tattvon ke pravesh ke kaaran shuddhta nahin rah gai thi tathaa inkaa patan bhi dhire-dhire ho gaya tha tathaapi jo adbhut maniyan is kaal main praapt huin, ve kisi bhi anya kaal main praapt nahin ho sakin, yah nihsandeh kaha ja saktaa he
 Art flourished in every way in the Bhaktikaal, a new environment was born, sources of devotion, love and reverence burst out among the masses, such a period is truly worthy of being called the "golden period" of literary history
 sampradaayon se mukt rup main bhi bhakthi kaa prachaar tha
 The names of Meera, Rasakhan, Rahim are taken with as much reverence as any of the saintly poets
 is tarah kaha ja saktaa he ki janata main sampradaay se bhi adhik shuddh bhakthi-bhav kii mahatta thi
 Ecumenical devotion took a collective form and engulfed the hearts of every person
 tulsi kii mrityu ke kuch samay baad hi reetikaal ke aagaman ke chihn dikhaai dene lage the
 The decadent form of Rama was normalized to include the temporal pastimes
 krishna kii prem bhakthi jaagrit karne vaali lilaon main se krishna kii shringaarik lilaon ko grahan karke uskaa ashleel chithran hone laga tha
 This situation had reached its abysmal form in Retikal
 isiilie kaha gaya tha "radhika kanhai sumarin ko bahaano he
 "the form of Rambhakti which Tulsi inscribed, though it did not tarnish, was forgotten by the poets living in the shelter of the kings in an atmosphere of adornment
 is tarah dhire-dhire i
1680-90 ke aasapaas bhaktikaal samaapt ho gaya
 Over the years, even though devotion remained in the public, neither it was able to generate great fame and neither a very popular book could be written
 bhakthi yug kaa yah aandolan bahut bada aandolan tha evam aisa aandolan bharat ne isse pehle kabhi nahin dekha tha
 This literature awakened reverence, devotion, faith, livelihood in the heart of the public, imparted courage, gaiety, love, presented a huge and encouraging picture of its motherland, its culture, patriotism was also awakened in the heart of the people for the same reason
 Happened
 bhakthiyug main is tarah mukhyat: bhaktiparak sahitya kii rachana hui parantu yah bhi purnataya nahin kaha ja saktaa ki kisi anya prakaar kaa sahitya us kaal main tha hi nahin
 This was the reign of Akbar and there were many poets in his court
 abdurrahim khaankhaana aadi kii rajprasastiparak kuch kavitaayen milti hai
 Akbar also encouraged the traditional stream of literature, so that form of poetry is also available in Kriparam's "hitarangini" Birbal's retail couplets etc
 iske atirikt niti parak dohe aadi likhe gayi
 Another great poet Acharya Keshav has been placed by Shukla ji in the retail poets of Bhaktikal
 yah kaary unhone keshav ke rachanakaal ke aadhaar par kiya he
 Shukla Ji has placed him among the great poets of this era, considering Keshav's ornamentation, verses, signs of rasa - three important compositions which represent examples - Kavipriya, Rasikapriya and Ramachandrika, apart from devotion
 keshav kaa acharyatva puure reetikaal ko gaurav pradaan karata he
 Method - Symptoms - The tradition of determining the example also appears in them first, even if it is inappropriate to separate Keshav from the ritual for this determination in the reticulum, so it is not appropriate to keep them in devotion
 bhaktikaal main lalit kalaon kaa utkarsh dikhaai detaa he
 Pictures of various leelas of Shri Krishna and Radha are found in this period, many idols expressing gentle and succulent expressions are found in this period
 murtikla kaa bahut vikaas is yug main bahut adhik hua tha
 Muslim style coordination in architecture, painting, and consequently the use of arches, domes etc
 became more visible in Indian style
 madhyakaal main rajasthani style adhik lokapriy thi
 In addition to human paintings, marking of natural scenes, various episodes of court life, murals are also received in this era
 ’qutubameenar’, ’adhaai din kaa jhunpda’ aadi aitihaasik vaastukala ke apratim namoonay hai
 In this way, fine arts were also greatly developed along with literature
 sangeet ke kshetra main bahut pragati hui
 The plan of the Krishnilalas to sing, sakhi, ramani, raga to the verse is not attainable elsewhere in this period
 sur or tulsi sahitya main anek raag-raganiyon kaa varnan aata he
 In conclusion, one can say that whatever Indian literature, Indian culture and history received during the growth and development of devotion, is unique, unique and rare in itself

 ati pracheen kaal se hi chikitsa ke do pramukh vibhaag chale aa rahe hai - kaaychikitsa evam shalyachikitsa 
 On this basis, two traditions also run among physicians
 ek kaaychikitsak or doosraa shalyachikitsak 
 Although both of them have more or less general importance of drug treatment, the importance of a physician's handwriting in surgery is of major importance, whereas the main form of medicine is medicine
 ayurveda main bhi dhanvantari sampradaay, yaa sushrut sampradaay, shalyachikitsa ke pratik hai jabaki aatreya sampradaay yaa charak sampradaay kaaychikitsa ke pratik hai

 Dhritarashtra was blind since birth, so Pandu was made king in his place, Dhritarashtra always got angry at his blindness and started to hate Pandu
 pandu ne sampoorn bharatvarsh ko jitkar kuru rajya kii simaao kaa yawano ke desh tak vistaar kar diya
 Once King Pandu along with his two wives - Kunti and Madri - went to the forest for hunting
 vahaan unhen ek mrug kaa maithunarat joda drushtigat hua
 Pandu immediately wounded the deer with his arrow
 marate huye mrigarupadhari nirdosh rishi ne pandu ko shaap diya, "rajan! tumhaare samaan krur purush is sansar main koi bhi nahin hoga
 You have shot me at the time of sexual intercourse, so whenever you become pregnant, you will die
 " Pandu was deeply saddened by this curse and said to his queens, "ladies! Now i will give up all my lusts and stay in this forest, you go back to Hastinapur
" After listening to their words, both queens grieved and said, " Nath! We cannot live for a single moment without you
 aap hamen bhi van main apane saath rakhane kii krupa kijiye
 "pandu accepted his request and allowed him to live with him in the forest
 isi dauraan raja pandu ne amavasya ke din rishi-muniyon ko brahma ji ke darshanon ke liye jate huye dekha
 He urged those sages and sages to take themselves along
 unke is aagrah par rishi-muniyon ne kaha, "rajan! koi bhi nihsantaan purush brahmalok jane kaa adhikari nahin ho saktaa atah ham aapako apane saath le jane main asamarth hai
 After listening to the sages, Pandu said to his wife, "O Kunti!" My birth is getting worse because childless person cannot get rid of father-debt, sage-debt, god-debt and man-loan
 Can you help me to get a son? "kunti said," o Aryaputra ! Durvasa Rishi has given me such a mantra by which i can get the desired thing by invoking any god
 aap ajna karen main kis devtaa ko bulaauun
 "at this, Pandu ordered to invite religion
 dharm ne kunti ko putr pradaan kiya jiskaa naam yudhisthir rakhaa gaya
 Later, Pandu ordered Kunti to invite Vayudev and Indradev twice
 vayudev se bhim tathaa indra se arjuna kii utpatti hui
 After this, by the command of Pandu, Kunti initiated the mantra to Madri
 maadri ne ashwanikumaron ko aamantrit kiya or nakul tathaa sahadev kaa janm hua
 One day King Pandu was touring along the Madri on the banks of Sarita in the forest
 vaataavaran atyant ramnik tha or sheethal-mand-sugandhit vaayu chal rahi thi
 Suddenly Madri's dress flew away with the wind
 isse pandu kaa man chanchal ho uthaa or ve maithun me pravruth huye hi the ki shaapvash unki mrityu ho gai
 Madri sati with them, but Kunti returned to Hastinapur for the upbringing of her sons
 waha rahane vaale rishi muni pando ko rajmahal chhod kar aa gayi, rishi muni tathaa kunti ke kehane par sabhi ne pando ko pandu kaa putr maan liya or unka swaagat kiya
 Courtesy of Sukhsagar vaisheshik hinduon ke shaddarshanon main se ek darshan he
 Its original promoter is the sage Kanad
 yah darshan nyaay darshan se bahut samya rakhata he kintu vastav main yah ek swatantra bhautik vigyaanvaadee darshan he
 Maharishi Kanad first wrote the ideas of this type of self-realization
 kanad ek rishi the
 These were "hereditary" and used to do austerity by collecting grains of grain and eating it
 isi liye inhen "kanad" yaa "kambhuk" kehete the
 Some have said that they have given a subtle idea of particle i
e
 atomic element, hence they are called "kanad"
 kisi kaa mat he ki din bhar ye samadhi main rahete the or raatri ko kanon kaa sangrah karte the
 This instinct is that of the "owl" bird
 kis kaa kahana he ki inaki tapasya se prasann hokar ishwar ne uluk pakshi ke rup main inhen shaastra kaa upadesh diya
 For this reason, this philosophy is famous by the names of "aulukya", "kanad", "vaishika" or "pashupat" philosophy
 pathan-pathan main vishesh prachlit na hone ke kaaran vaisheshik sutron main anek pathbhed hai tathaa 'trutiyaan' bhi paryaapt hai
 Some of its formulas, like the Mimamsutras, contain repetitions - such as "general specifics", "general specifics": "," tattvam bhaven "," dravatyavatyanatave vayana lakhyate "," doubtful explanation: "
 iske namakaran ke do kaaran kahe jate hai - They have considered a substance called "special" in order to separate each routine substance and to separate the actual nature of each element separately; "dvitv", "pakajotpatti" evam "vibhaagaj vibhaag" in teen baton main inkaa apana vishesh mat he jisamen ye drudh hai
 The idea is that while Vaishika's philosophy is engaging in the consideration of practical elements, even if it remains largely the same in a broad sense, each object is different from the other
 inhone iske parichaayak ekmaatr padaarth "vishesh" par bal diya he, isliye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii is dhara ko "vaisheshik" darshan kehete hai
 Other scriptures have not discussed this
 par ukt kuch kaarnon se is darshan ko "vaisheshik darshan" kii sangya di gai he
 Both Vaishika and Nyaya are philosophies
 vyaavhaarik jagat ko yah vaastavik maanate hai
 They consider a deep and close connection in the concept of external world and inner world
 bahya jagat vichaar par nirbhar nahin he, yah swatantra he
 For 'self-realization', it is equally necessary to get knowledge of all the small and big, elemental and frivolous objects of the world
 in tatwon ke gyaan ke liye pramaanon kii apeksha hoti he
 In jurisprudence, special consideration has been given to proof, but in Vaishika philosophy mainly the idea of 'theorem' has been emphasized
 yahan samaran karana aavashyak he ki nyaay kii tarah vaisheshik bhi, loukik drushti hi se vishwa ke 'vaastavik' tatwon par darshanik vichaar karata he
 He never ignores the real conditions of the cosmic world, however, where the idea of an element cannot be without a subtle vision, there is some way to establish his theory based on senses, imperishable, subtle, yogic etc
 Has a nature, otherwise their ideological reefs would have been contradictory; As a result, acceptance of the elements like atom, sky, time, space, soul, mind, etc
 is equally present in this philosophy
 vaisheshikon ke swaroop, vesh tathaa aachaar aadi 'naiyayikon' kii tarah hote hai; jaise, ye log shaiva hai, inhen shaiva-diksha di jaati thi
 There are four major differences - Shaiv, Pashupat, Mahavratadhar, and minor differences like Kalmukh and Bharata, Bhaktar, etc
 are also found
 vaisheshik vishesh rup se "pashupat" kahe jate hai
 
 vaisheshik mat main samast vishwa "bhav or abhaav" in do vibhaagon main vibhajit he
 There are six divisions of "bhava" - whose names are matter, quality, action, general, special, and collective
 abhaav ke bhi chaar up-bhed hai - pragabhav, pradhvansabhaav, atyantabhaav tathaa anyonyabhaav
 In the texts, their characteristics etc
 are obtained like this: dravyajisamen "dravyatv jati" ho vahi dravya he
 Equalization of work is called Dravya
 dravya gunon kaa aashray he
 Earth, water, tejas, air, sky, kaal, dikha, soul and mind are called nine "matter"
 inamen se pratham chaar dravyon ke nity or anitya, do bhed hai
 The regular form is called the "atom" and the infinite form is the work
 chaaron bhuton ke us hisse ko "parmaanu" kehete hai jiskaa pun: bhaag na kiya ja sake, atev yah nity he
 Apart from Prithvi Pramanu, the properties of other atoms are also constant
 jisase gandh ho vah "prithvi", jisamen sheet sparsh ho vah "jal" jisamen ushn sparsh ho vah "tejas", jinamein rup na ho tathaa agni ke sanyog se utpann na hone vaala, anushna or asheet sparsh ho, vah "vaayu", tathaa shabd jiskaa gun ho arthath shabd kaa jo samavayikaran ho, vah "akaash" he
 These are also called 'panchabhut'
 akaash, kaal, dik tathaa aatma ye chaar "vibhu" dravya hai
 Man is non-material atom and also continual
 aaj, kal, is samay, us samay, maas, varsh, aadi samay ke vyavhaar kaa jo saadhaaran kaaran he- vah kaal he
 The period is constant and extensive
 purv, pashchim, uttar, dakshin, aadi dishaao tathaa vidishaao kaa jo asaadhaaran kaaran he, vah "dik" he
 It is also regular and comprehensive
 aatma or manas kaa swaroop yahan nyaayamat ke samaan hi he
 Asymmetry of virtue is "virtue"
 rup, ras, gandh, sparsh, sankhya, pariman, pruthaktv, sanyog, vibhaag, paratv, apratv, gurutv, dravatv, sneh, shabd, gyaan, sukh, du:kha, ichha, dwesh, praytn, dharm adharm tathaa sanskaar ye choubees gun ke bhed hai
 Of these, from form, smell, juice, touch, affection, natural fluidity, words and knowledge to the sacrament, these are the "peculiar qualities", the residual ordinary qualities
 gun dravya hi main rahete hai
 The function is called "karma"
 upar phenkna, neeche phenkna, sikudna, failaana tathaa gaman, jaise bhraman, spandan, rechan, aadi, ye paanch "karm" ke bhed hai
 Karma remains in matter only
 saamannek vastuon main jo ek si buddhi hoti he, uske kaaran prayek ghat main jo "yah ghat he" is prakaar kii e si buddhi hoti he, uskaa kaaran usamen rahanevaala "saamaanya" he, jise vastu ke naam ke aage "tv" lagaakar kaha jaataa he, jaise - ghatatv, patatv
 "tv" means knowledge of all persons under that caste
 yah nity he or dravya, gun tathaa karm main rahata he
 The more accommodating is called "normal", "normal" or "normal" or "power over"
 sattasamanya dravya, gun tathaa karm in teenon main rahata he
 What is common in every object and teacher is called "upper normal" or "normal special"
 ek vastu ko duusari vastu se pruthak karnaa saamaanya kaa arth he
 One who lives in the last department of specialties and one who lives in routine is called "special"
 nity dravyon main paraspar bhed karanevaala ekmaatr yahi padaarth he
 It is infinite
 samavyek prakaar kaa sambandh he, jo avyav or avyavi, gun or guni, kriya or kriyavan jati or vyakti tathaa vishesh or nity dravya ke bich rata he
 He is one and also continual
 kisi vastu kaa na hona, us vastu kaa "abhaav" kaha jaataa he
 There are four distinctions - "prague lack" is the first reason for the work to arise, the absence of that work, the absence of that work when the "absence lack" work, "extreme lack" in all the three periods which are completely lacking, such as Vandhya's son and "non-interdependence" are mutual absence, such as lack of septum in ghat and non-depletion of pat
 ye sabhi padaarth nyaayadarshan ke pramayon ke antargat he
 Therefore, they do not have a separate view in the judiciary, but they are mainly considered in Vaiseshika philosophy
 vaisheshik mat ke anusaar in saaton padaarthon kaa vaastavik gyaan praapt karne se mukti milti he
 Even though there is so much difference in the nature of substances between these two similar elements, both philosophies remain in the same, it is because the main theorem of both scriptures is "soul"
 aatma kaa swaroop donon darshanon main ek hi sa he
 The other subject is - the remedy to know the same soul
 usamen in donon darshanon main vishesh antar bhi nahin he
 There is a difference between words only and sometimes in process
 fal main bhed nahin he
 Therefore, according to the Judgment, from the philosophy of sixteen substances like proof, theorem, etc
 one gets the same kind of "liberation" from both
 donon kaa drushtikon bhi ek hi he
 In the Nyaya Vesika doctrine, earth, water, light and air also exist in the form of these four substances
 in laagon kaa mat main sabhi kaary dravyon kaa naash ho jaataa he or ve parmaanu rup main akaash main rahete hai
 This state is called "holocaust"
 is avasthaa main prayek jeevatma apane manas ke saath tathaa purv janmon ke karmon ke sanskaron ke saath tathaa adrusht rup main dharm or adharm ke saath vidyaman rahati he
 But at this time there is no work of creation
 kaaran rup main sabhi vastuen us samay kii pratiksha main rahati hai, jab jeevon ke sabhi adrusht kaary rup main parinat hone ke liye tatpar ho jate hai
 But there is an unseen root, even if the body is not there, the individual soul cannot do any work, atoms etc
 are all roots, then how should the action for "creation" arise? iske uttar main yah jaananaa chahie ki utpann honevaale jeevon ke kalyaan ke liye paramatma main sristi karne kii ichha utpann ho jaati he, jisase jeevon ke adrusht karyonmukh ho jate hai
 a type of action occurs in atoms, whereby one atom is combined with another atom
 do parmaanuon ke sanyog se ek "dravyanuk" utpann hota he
 The two atoms that are assembled to generate the earthly body are earthly atoms
 ve donon utpann hue "davyanuk" ke samavayikaaran hai
 The combination of both of them is asymmetric and unfriendly, God's will, etc
 isi prakaar jaleey, taijas aadi sharir ke sambandh main samajhnaa chahie
 It should be remembered that both homogeneous atoms are not created by mere creation
 unke saath ek vijaateey parmaanu, jaise jaleey parmaanu bhi rahata he
 The "mass" has a molecule, so it is not visible
 "davayanuk" se jo kaary utpann hoga vah bhi anupariman kaa hi rahegaa or vah bhi drushtigochar na hoga
 Therefore, the help of "three numbers" is taken to generate macro function from the atmosphere
 nyaay-vaisheshik main sthool dravya, sthool dravya kaa mahat parimanwale dravya se tathaa teen sankhya se utpann hota he
 Therefore, three numbers of the davyanukas generate the gross matter "trianuk" or "trishrenu"
 chaar tryanuk se chaturanuk utpann hota he
 In this sequence, earth and earthly substances are generated
 dravya ke utpann hone ke pashchaat usamen gunon kii bhi utpatti hoti he
 This is the process of creation
 sansar main jitani vastuen utpann hoti hai sabhi utpann hue jeevon ke bhoga ke liye hi hai
 The organism arises in the world due to the effects of deeds of its former birth
 usee prakaar bhoga ke anukool uske sharir, yoni, kul, desh, aadi sabhi hote hai
 When that special enjoyment ceases, then he dies
 isi prakaar apane apane bhoga ke samaapt hone par sabhi jeevon kii mrityu hoti he
 Nyayamat - There is also a sequence for "destruction"
 kaary dravya main, arthath ghat main, prahaar ke kaaran uske avyavon main ek kriya utpann hoti he
 By that action the department is in its components, the department eliminates the initiator combinations of the component
 or phir ghat nasht ho jaataa he
 In this sequence, all the work materials are destroyed at one time by the will of God
 isse spasht he ki asamavayikaaran ke naash se kaarydravya kaa naash hota he
 Sometimes the termination of the termination is also destroyed by the destruction of time
 inkaa dhyey he ki bina kaaran ke naash hue kaary kaa naash nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, for the destruction of the universe, the action is produced in the atom itself and the atom is eternal, it is not destroyed, but the combination of two atoms is destroyed and then the "mass" form produced from it works and in the same order " "trinity" and "chatrunuk" and other works are also destroyed
 naiyayik log sthool drushti ke anusaar itnaa sookshm vichaar nahin karte
 In his opinion, once the gross matter is destroyed by mere shock
 kaary dravya ke naash hone par uske gun nasht ho jate hai
 There are also two previous opinions in this which have been represented in the "process of cooking"
 nyaay mat kii tarah vaisheshik mat main bhi buddhi, uplabdhi, gyaan tathaa pratyay ye samaan arth ke bodhak shabd hai
 In other philosophies, all these words are used in different terminological meanings
 buddhi ke anek bhed hone par bhi pradhan rup se iske do bhed hai - "vidya" or "avidya", avidya ke chaar bhed he - sanshay, viparyay, anadhyavsaay tathaa swapn
 Doubts and reversals have been represented in justice
 vaisheshik mat main inke arth main koi antar nahin he
 Indeterminate knowledge is called "non-occupation"
 jaise - katahal ko dekhakar vahik ko, ek sasna aadi se yukt gaay ko dekhakar narikel dweepavasiyon ke man main shankaa hoti he ki yah kya he? All the parts of the body get tired by working throughout the day
 unako vishram kii apeksha hoti he
 The senses are especially tired and absorbed in the mind
 phir man manowh naadee ke dwaara puritat naadee main vishram ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 Before reaching there, due to the rites of pre-work and the dissatisfaction of vat, pitta and kapha, the support of the unseen is revealed to the mind at that time by a variety of subjects, which is called dream knowledge
 yahan itnaa dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki vaisheshik mat main gyaan ke antargat ho "avidya" ko rakhaa he or isiilie "avidya" ko "mithyaa gyaan" bhi kehete hai
 Many say that these two words are against each other
 jo mithyaa hai, vah gyaan nahin kaha ja saktaa or jo gyaan he, vah kadaapi mithyaa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 There are also four types of learning - direct, inference, memory and joy
 yahan yah dhyaan main rakhana he ki nyaay main "smriti" ko yatharthagyan nahin kaha he
 That is the knowledge of the known
 isi prakaar "aarsh gyaan" bhi naiyayik nahin maanate
 The words or arrivals of the Nāyayikas have been inferred by the Vaishyāsikas in the estimation and the Upaman in direct
 veda ke rachnewale rishiyon ko bhoot tathaa bhavishya kaa gyaan pratyaksh ke samaan hota he
 It does not require approximation of sense and meaning
 yah "pratibh" gyaan yaa "arshgyaan" kehalaata he
 This knowledge also sometimes occurs in a pure living being
 jaise - ek pavitra kanya kahati he - kal mere bhai aavenge or sachmuch kal uske bhai aa hi jate hai
 This is "primordial knowledge"
 pratyaksh or anumaan ke vichaar main donon darshanon main koi bhi matbhed nahin he
 Therefore, they were not considered again here
 karm kaa bahut vistrut vivechan vaisheshik darshan main kiya gaya he
 These people also accept the five distinctions of "karma" as stated in the Nyaya Darshan in the same sense
 kayik cheshtaaon hi ko vastut: in logon ne "karm" kaha he
 Yet all efforts are made with the same effort
 atev vaisheshik darshan main ukt paanch bhedon ke prayek ke saakshaat tathaa parampara main praytn ke sambandh se koi karm prayatnpurvak hote hai, jinhen "satpratyay-karm" kehete hai, koi bina praytn ke hote hai, jinhen "asatpratyay-karm" kehete hai
 Apart from these, there are some such deeds, such as those in the earth, which are without any effort, are called "untimely deeds"
 in sab baton ko dekhakar yah spasht he ki vaisheshik mat main tatwon kaa bahut sookshm vichaar he
 Nevertheless, in the opinion of justice in worldly matters, Vaiseshika is very much agreed
 atev ye donon "samantantr" kahe jate hai
 In these two philosophies, there is a mention of some distinctions in which there is a "distinction"
 is prakaar ke donon shaastra katipay siddhanton main bhinn-bhinn mat rakhte hue bhi paraspar sambhddha hai
 Their other principles are mutually applicable

 Similarly the religious places of the greek-christian sect located in Turkey were given under the patronage of the Tsar of Russia
 kintu france kii prakhyat rajkranti ke samay france apane uttardaayitv kii ore samuchit dhyaan na de sakaa
 Gradually, the saints of the greek-christian sect became dominant over Latin religions
 1850 i
 main francenaresh napolian tritiy kaa dhyaan latin carch kii ore gaya; usne unke prabandh ko france ke sangrakshan main de dene ke liye turki ko likhaa
 In 1852 AD, he repeated this demand
 kuch hila-hawali karne ke baad turki ke sultan ne france kii is maang ko sweekaar kar liya
 There was no reason for Russia to object to this Turkish work; But he saw it as a good opportunity to seize Turkey
 unani-isai sampradaay kaa paksh lekar jaar ne sultan ko latin dharmik sthalon kaa prabandh unhen lautaa dene ko likhaa
 This made England apprehensive
 use dar laga ki kustutuniya par rus kaa adhikaar ho jane par sthal maarg se bharat ke liye sthaayee khatra utpann ho jayega or yah aisa khatra hoga jiskaa kisi prakaar bhi saamana karnaa uske liye sambhav na hoga
 He stood up to help Turkey against Russia
 france ke liye to rusht hone kaa spasht kaaran tha hi
 Russia is interfering with the right to care for its shrines
 kintu isse bada kaaran yah tha ki jaar nicholas pratham ne france ke nae samrat ko ‘bhai’ sambodhit na kar ‘mitra’ sambodhit kiya tha
 Therefore, seeing the favor of the greek-christian sect of Russia, he saw a threat to his dynasty
 austria ko bhi balcon kii ore roosi badhaav se ghabrahat hui
 Although in 1849, Austria received his ancestral throne with Russian military aid, it did not seem appropriate to accept Russia's gratitude and remain silent on this occasion

 He turned down Russia's challenge at the behest of the British ambassador

 Then, in early January 1854, a joint fleet of England and France entered Kalasagar and the two countries soon declared war against Russia
 unhone apni rakshaatmak yuddh karne kii yojana banaai
 To protect Kustuntunia, he decided to build fortifications at Gallipoli
 kintu iske purv ki angl-french senaayen kalasagar ke pashchimi tat par varna main ekatra hon, austria ke amaitreepurn rukh ko dekhakar rus ne apni sena ko turki ke adhikrut pradeshon se waapas bula liya
 Thus ended the possibility of an invasion of Turkey by Russia
 falat: england or france kii sthiti visham ho gai
 Violent cholera spread in Varna

 On the other hand, the return of his army to India without fighting was a sign of inferiority of the rulers of both the countries

 Russia had a naval base at Sevastopol on its southern coast

 The two countries took a harsh decision, but neither of them had any knowledge about the territory of Crimea

 Till then he did not know that there is no more than two-three feet of water in the sea on either side of the degree of land
 unhone yuddh ke liye aadesh jari kar die
 The armies reached Eupotoria on 14 September
 17 sitambar ko unhone sevastopol kii or badhanaa aarambh kar diya
 On 20 September, he defeated the Russian army, but with no conclusive results

 The anglo-french army laid siege to the fort

 When winter subsided, another problem arose

 Therefore, the orders which reached the headquarters of both the countries in ten days, now started arriving in 24 hours
 is suvidha kaa upyog england or france ne alag alag dhang se kiya
 For England, military failure meant nothing more than a rearrangement in the cabinet
 at: yuddh vibhaag ne uskaa upyog keval apane captain jevis ke swasthya ke prati chintaa vyakt karne main kiya
 But for the Emperor of France, defeat was a message of the destruction of the dynasty
 at: ve apane senapati ko danaadan suzav, salaah or aadesh bhejne lage
 As a result, the generals of both the countries were unable to get up from the table and think of anything else due to this kind of exchange of wires

 In June, the English army attacked Redan and the French army attacked Melekaf but the Russians thwarted both attacks

 By this time, the French king Napoleon was also afraid of this war

 But the British, who had failed in the attack of Sevastopol, were upset
 ve yuddh jari rakhana chaahate the kintu akele rus se yuddh kar sakna unke bas kii baat na thi
 The diagnosis occurred in Paris

 In other words, Russia had to withdraw its warship from Kalasagar; But within fifteen years these things of the treaty became meaningless

 As a result of this war, on one side, Russia's Turkish plan failed, on the other hand, Turkey got new life
 italy or germany ke ekikaran rus kii raajnneeti balkan prayadweep ke purna nirmaan evam antarrashtriya raajnneeti par is yuddh kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 There were many reasons for this war
 jo is prakaar he
 Russian policy 19 veen shatabdi main turki samrajya kaa patan hota ja rahaa tha
 Taking advantage of this, various European nations wanted to divide it among themselves
 rus iske liye vishesh prayatnsheel tha
 He began to take a keen interest in Turkey's case
 rus chahta tha
 That Turkey be weakened so that it could expand its empire in the Balkan region
 at: usne balcon prayadweep ke praja ko turki ke khilaaf andolan ke liye bhadakaayaa
 Russia's objective was to end Turkey
 or turki samrajya ke khandhar par k vishaal rusi samrajya kaa mahal khadaa karnaa chahta tha
 Therefore, whenever he got the chance, Russia proposed to split Turkey against the European
 britain kaa swaarth- England was a strong opponent of Russia's ambition
 kyonki bhumadhya sagar main rus kaa pravesh englad ke liye sankat utpann kar saktaa tha
 At the same time, the Indian Empire of England could also be in danger due to Russia's authority over Turkey
 isliye bhartiya samrajya kii suraksha ke liye turki ko rus ke adhikaar main jane se bachaane ke liye uski ahm bhoomika thi
 England never wanted it to expand eastward
 halanki rus ne england ko apni ore milaane kii cheshtaa kii lekin use safalataa nahin mil saki
 Even after various attempts, when England could not be in favor of Russia, he started planning to annex Turkey by the sword
 france kaa swaarth- France was also eyeing Europe's ailing nation Turkey
 lui nepolian yuddh niti ke dwaara france kaa vistaar karnaa chahta tha
 He began to interfere in Turkey's case
 kreemia yuddh kaa shutrapat nepolian ke isi niti ke falswarup hua
 Mohammal Ali's Rebellion and European Nations Intervention in Turkey- mohammad ali mishra kaa governor tha
 Who was the suzerain of the Turkish Empire

 Despite Turkey's aid in Greece's freedom struggle, it did not benefit her
 at: vah syria ke viruddh sainik kaarywahi kii
 The Turkish Sultan was terrified at this

 This led to disharmony among the various nations and the leading European countries began to pressurize Turkey to withdraw the Russian army to make a pact with Mohammad Ali
 samjhauta ke falswarup mohammad ali ko syria de diya gaya
 Here, Russia wanted some prize from Turkey in return for his help
 1832 main usne turki ke saath ek sandhi kii jiske dwaara turki par rus kaa prabhaav kaayam ho gaya
 England was alarmed by the incident and called a conference of European states in London
 sabhi rashtron ne ek sandhi patr par hastakshar kiya
 As a result, Russia's influence on Turkey decreased somewhat

 Religious reasons isaai kaa pavitra jerusalem turki samrajya ke adheen tha
 Saints of the Roman and Greek churches lived there
 unke saath turki sultan kaa vyavhaar acha nahin tha at: 1742 ke sandhi ke anusaar roman sanyasi kii raksha kaa bhaar rus par kar diya gaya
 But chaos erupted in France as a result of the French Revolution
 to unani padri ne roman carch par akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Louis Napoleon began to dedicate the Roman clergy, and Russia began to side with the Greek clergy
 at: purvi samasya bigadane lagi
 Diplomacy tension prevailed in Europe over this problem for three years
 rus europe main kutniti tanaav vyapt rahaa
 Russia wanted to invade Turkey by making religious pretext and seizing its territories
 1853 main rus ne turki par akraman kiya tathaa noladavia or belaysia par adhipaty kar liya
 On Russia, England and France assure Turkey of assistance; Turkey assures Turkey
 On 27 February 1854, England and France jointly warned Russia that Russia should vacate the territory of Turkey

 There was immense loss of money

 The war ended by the Treaty of Paris in March 1856
 is prakaar yuddh man mistra rashtron kii vijay or rus kii paraajay hui
 On 30 March 1856, the Paris Treaty was signed by representatives from England, France, Austria, Turkey, Servia and Russia
 jiske anusaar kalasagar kii tatasth kshetra ghoshit kiya gaya
 All the rivers were internationalized
 mol divia or bolegia par rus kaa sangrakshan samaapt kar diya gaya
 Servia's independence was guaranteed
 turki ko europe ke raashtra samuh main shaamil kar liya gaya
 And accepted its integrity and independence
 kreemia yuddh europea itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 Two types of conceptions have been expressed about this war
 rabart merriott ne ise aadhunik yug kaa purn vyarth yuddh bataaya tha, unhone likhaa he
 "the only perfectly useless modern war that has been waged
" Lord Cromer says the opposite
 ‘yadi kreemia yuddh nahin hota to turki par rus kaa adhipaty kaayam ho jaataa’ da
 em
 kedelvi ne likhaa he
 As a result of the Crimea War, Russia's Turkish plans were halted
 rus kii jabardast paraajay hui
 Turkey got new life under the protection of Europe Napoleon's attack froze
 england kaa rashtriya rin bad gaya or austria ne ek mahaan desh kii shatru mol lee
 Robert Morritt's view seems to be in part excusable
 kreemia yuddh ke pashchaat turki kaa patan avashyabhanvi ho gaya
 Servia was granted independence
 yah anya paradheen deshon ke liye prerana strot sabit hua
 And foreigners became restless for their freedom
 kreemia yuddh kaa pramukh uddeshy rus ko kamjor bananaa tha
 But even this objective could not be successful
 yah sochna ki rus aage chajalkar shant ho jayega galat sabit hua
 As soon as he got the chance, he plunged into the former problem again
 The purpose of the Treaty of Paris was to curb Russian ambitions and to keep Turkey alive, but this could not be an angel either
 at: yah kaha ja saktaa he
 That the war was fought for the purposes for which it was fought
 us drushti se yah vyarth sabit hua
 England or France did not benefit anyone
 parantu itnaa hote hue bhi kreemia yuddh ko purna vyarth yuddh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In fact its indirect result proved to be far-reaching and important
 ketolavi likhaa he
 "it is indirect results were greater out of the mud of Cremica new Italy way made and less of obviously a new Germany" Indeed, this war had such a definite effect on the events of the 19th century that the importance built in Vienna in 1815
 His foundation was shaken
 turki par prabhaav- As a result of this war, Turkey got new life
 vah europe ke raashtra samuh main shaamil ho gaya
 His integrity and independence were accepted
 rus kaa bhay samaapt ho gaya
 Effect on Russia is yuddh ne rus kii sainik shakti ko aghat pahunchaaya or jaar shahi kii kamajori ko ujagar kar diya
 He had to suffer even more damage, the idea of the historian Hojan
 ‘is rashtriya apmaan main bhavishya kii aashaaen nihit thi
 Just as the army was completely formed after the defeat of the army, so was the reconstruction of Russia, it is an important event of the historian of Russia
 kyonki is paraajay ke baad hi yahan vyapak sudhaar hua parantu kreemia yuddh kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn parinaam yah hua ki iskaa kustuntuniya par adhikaar karne or kaala sagar ko rusi jhil banane kaa sapana bhang ho gaya
 Impact on England is yuddh main england kaa uddeshy pura ho gaya
 The expansion of Russia was banned but it caused huge loss of money to England and its national tax was given, which made it difficult to implement reform schemes
 france par prabhaav- The pride of France increased considerably in the wake of the war
 yuddh main rus kii paraajay hui
 Napoleon avenged France's defeat with Russia
 italy par prabhaav- This war also had an impact on Italy and Germany
 If this war had not taken place, Italy and Germany would not have been unified, in fact, Italy was greatly benefited by this war
 austria par prabhaav- England and France were unhappy with Austria's adoption of a policy of neutrality
 rus bhi naaraaz ho gaya
 Austria became friendless and no one was left with her

 James's Square
 iske ek bistar 'da handere bed' kaa sampoorn kharchaa shashvatata ke liye lard langatok ne uthaaya tha
 Equipment in the hospital was probably inadequate since the basic requirements of wound healing such as bandages were reduced in 1872

 sankramak rogon ke liye aspataal 1960 ke dashak se kuch samay pehle apane samaapan tak yahan rahaa tha
 In 1840, Lord Llangattok donated £ 1000 for the replacement of the dispensary, along with donations from Carthage Cottages
