 manusmriti ke tikaakar medhatithi ke shabdon main vivaah ek nishchit paddati se kiya jane vaala, anek vidhiyon se sampann hone vaala tathaa kanya ko patni banane vaala sanskaar he

 But other scholars do not accept this view as correct
 unka kahana he ki aadim manushyon main antarvivaah ke dushprinaamon jaisi jatil jeevashastreey prakriya ko samajhane kii vuddhi sweekaar karnaa tarksangat nahin prathit hota

 bharat kii santhal, ho, oraanv, khadiya, gond, bhil aadi jatiyon main kanya ke matapita ko kanyashulk dekar patni praapt karne kii paripati he

 The above mentioned means of acquiring wife are based on the classification of modern sociological scholars
 pracheen bhartiya dharamshastrakaron ne inhen ko brahm, daiv, aarsh, prajapaty, aasur, gandharv, rakshas or paishaach naamak aath prakaar ke vivaahon kaa naam diya tha
 Of these, the first four types of marriages were considered to be expansive and religious
 ye sab vivaah matapita kii sahmati se kiye janevaale uparyukt vivaah ke antargat hai
 In all marriages that were performed with religious ritual, the girl was decorated with cloth and donated it
 kintu pichley chaar vivaahon main kanya kaa daan nahin hota, vah mulya se yaa prem se yaa balpurvak lee jaati he

 The best known ancient example of this was the marriage of Dushyant and Shakuntala

 Marriage of more than one man with a woman is called polygamy
 ek purush ke ek stri ke saath vivaah ko ek vivaah yaa ekapatnivrath kaha jaataa he
 The first and third forms of these are more prevalent in various societies of mankind
 duusare rup bahubhartruta kaa prachlan bahut kam he
 Due to the almost equal number of females in the society, at this stage some men are deprived of marriage if more women are made wives, so in some wild societies the number of women to be wives by a man is banned
 Goes and by practice it is fixed
 bhootpurv british purvi africa kii vaasania jati main ek purush ko teen se adhik striyon ke saath, landu jati main tathaa islam main chaar se adhik striyon ke saath, uttari nigeria kii kuganma jati main chah se adhik striyon ke saath vivaah kii anumati nahin di jaati
 This number is very high for kings and chieftains
 pashchimi africa main goldcost basti ke ashaanti naamak rajya ke raja ke liye patniyon kii nishchit sakhya, 3,333 thi
 How the kings encroach and violate these certain numbers is evident from the example of Ibn Saud, the founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
 islam main chaar se adhik striyon se vivaah varjit he, at: ebn saood ko jab kisi naveen stri se vivaah karnaa hota tha to vah apni pehali chaar patniyon main se kisi ek ko talaak de detaa tha
 Thus, he followed the limits of four wives and married more than a hundred women
 kuch vanya jatiyon main saradaaron dwaara apane samaaj kii itani adhik striyon par adhikaar kar liya jaataa he ki kuch nirdhan yuva purush vivaah ke liye vadhoo nahin praapt kar sakate
 In some castes in Australia, such a man is given the right to challenge a man who has many women and get a wife from him
 bahubharyata kaa ek vishesh rup shyaali vivaah arthath ek purush dwaara apni patni kii bahinon se vivaah karnaa he
 The big advantage in this is probably the reduction of Sautiya dah and the sisters have to live in a loving manner
 yah pratha america ke red indianon main bahut milti he
 Famous ancient Indian example of polygamy or marriage of multiple men to one woman

 This practice still prevails in many states of India - Ladakh, Spiti Lahaul Parganas in Kangra district of Punjab, Chambaku, Kullu and Mandi highs
 Among the Kanets living in the territories, Jaunsar Babur in Dehradun district, Nairo of Malabar in South India, Todas of Nilgiri, Ku It is found in rhombes and coats

 Nowadays, this type of polyandry is found in the Khas people of Jaunsar Bawar in Dehradun district and in the Nilgiri Todas

 This type of polyandry was prevalent among the Nair people of Malawar earlier
 bahubhartruta ke utpaadak kaarnon ke sambandh main samajashastriyon tathaa nrivanshashastriyon main prabal matbhed he
 Wastermark has stated that the main reason for the decrease in the number of women than men
 udaahranarth nilgiri ke todon main balikawadh kii kupratha ke kaaran ek stri ke peeche do purush ho gaye, at: vahaan bahubhartruta kaa prachlan swaabhaavik rup se ho gaya
 But Robert Briffault proved that the lack of women is not the only reason for this practice

 According to Cunningham, women outnumber men in Ladakh

 The practice of monogamy is the most prevalent and common practice in human society
 jin samaajon main bahubharyata kii pratha he, unamem bhi yah pratha prachlit he kyonki bahubharyata kii pratha kaa paalan prayek samaaj main bahut thode vyakti hi karte hai
 For example, the people of Greenland are called polytheistic societies, but Kranz found only one out of 20 men in this state to marry two women, ie only five percent of the men were following the rules of marriage to many women
 ekavivaah kii vyavastha kaa prachlan sabase adhik hone kaa bada kaaran yah he ki adhikansh samaajon main stri purushon kii sankhya kaa anupaat lagbhag samaan hota he or ek vivaah kii vyavastha adhiktam narnariyon ke liye jeevanasathi prastut karti he
 The darun practice of war, kanyavadh and the risk of occupation may spoil the balance of the number of men, but often it keeps the balance and helps in the arrangement of monogamy, as it provides the opportunity for the marriage of most individuals

 pashchimi jagat main aajkal ekavivaah kaa niyam saarvbhaum he

 There is an astonishing diversity in marriage rituals
 kintu inhen chaar bade virgon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he
 In the first category, there are methods to inform the change in the situation of the bride and groom
 vivaah main kanyadan kanya ke pita se pati ke niyantran main jane kii sthiti ko dyotit karata he

 scotland main vadhoo ke peeche purana juuta yah suchit karne ke liye phenkaa jaataa he ki ab pita kaa usapar koi adhikaar nahin rahaa
 The second class of methods aims to remove side effects
 europe or africa main vivaah ke samay dushtatmaon ko maar bhagane ke liye baan phenke jate hai or bandooke chodi jaati hai
 The abodes of the demons are dark places and are mutilated by the use of fire in marriage
 vivaah ke samay var dwaara talwaar aadi kaa dhaaran, england main vadhoo dwaara dushtatmaon ko bhagane main samarth samajhi janevaali ghode kii naal le jane kii vidhi kaa kaaran bhi yahi samajha jaataa he
 The third category includes the symbolism of fertility and the methods that indicate the desire for child enhancement
 bharat, china, malaya main vadhoo par chaaval, anaaj tathaa fal daalane kii vidhiyaan prachlit hai
 Just as a single grain of grain produces many new donations, similarly the bride is expected to produce abundant children
 slav deshon main vadhoo kii god main isi uddeshy se ladkaa baithaaya jaataa he
 The methods of the fourth class indicate the unity and integrality of the bride and groom

 The Hindu and Roman Catholic Christian societies are beautiful examples of this
 kintu vivahaviched yaa talaak ke niyamon ke sambandh main atyadhik bhinnata hone par bhi kuch moulik siddhanton main samanta he
 Marriage is mainly done for procreation and marriage, but if it is not achieved in a marriage, then marriage should be allowed instead of making the marriage life hellish or unsuccessful
 is vyavastha kaa durupyog na ho, is drushti se talaak kaa adhikaar anek pratibandhon ke saath vishesh avasthaa main hi diya jaataa he

 There is no doubt that the traditional forms of marriage are currently undergoing major changes due to several reasons
 vivaah ko dharmik bandhan ke sthaan par kanoonee bandhan tathaa pati-patni kaa nijee maamla maanane kii pravriti bad rahi he
 Women are becoming financially independent from the industrial revolution and the spread of education
 pehle unke sukhmay jeevanyaapan kaa ekmaatr saadhan vivaah tha, ab aisi sthiti nahin rahi
 The new laws of marriage and divorce are equating the rights of Narnari with marriage rights
 dharm ke prati aasthaa main shithilataa or garbhanirodh ke sadhano ke avishkaar ne vivaah vishyak puraani manyataon ko, pragvaivaahik satitv or pavitrataa ko gaharaa dhakka pahunchaaya he
 But despite all these changes, the main reason for the continuation of the marriage process in the future is that it fulfills some purposes which cannot be done by any other means or institution
 pehla prayojan vanshavriddhi kaa he
 Although science has invented artificial insemination, the production and development of infants in laboratories artificially does not seem possible
 doosraa prayojan santan kaa paalan he, rajya or samaaj shishushaalaon or balodyanon kaa kitna hi vikaas kar le, unamem inke sarvangin samuchit vikaas kii waisi vyavastha sambhav nahin, jaisi vivaah evam parivaar kii sanstha main hoti he
 The third purpose is true love and happiness
 yah bhi vivaah ke atirikt kisi anya saadhan se sambhav nahin
 In order to fulfill these purposes, marriage will continue to be an important institution even if some changes are made in it

 kashmiri pandit samudaay ke saath unke mul kii vajah se ve pandit nehru bhi bulaayen jate the, jabaki bhartiya bachche unhen chachaa nehru ke rup main jaanate hai
 Nehru was elected by the Congress to hold the post of the first Prime Minister of independent India, although the question of leadership was settled long back in 1941, when Gandhiji acknowledged Nehru as his political heir and successor
 pradhanmantri ke rup main, ve bharat ke sapane ko saakaar karne ke liye chal pade
 The Constitution of India was enacted in 1950, after which he launched an ambitious plan of economic, social and political reforms

 In foreign policy, portraying India as a regional hero in South Asia, he played a leading role in the non-absolutist movement

 Despite political troubles in his last years and the failure of his leadership in the 1962 chinese-india War, he remained popular among the people of India
 bharat main, unka janmdin bal diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa hai
 Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad, British India
 unke pita, motilal nehru, ek dhani barrister jo kashmiri pandit samudaay se the, swatantrata sangram ke dauraan bhartiya rashtriya congress ke do baar adhyaksh chune gaye
 His mother Swarooprani Thusu, from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife and the first wife died during childbirth
 jawaharlal teen bacchon main se sabase bade the, jinamein baaki do ladkiyaan thi
 The elder sister, Vijaya Lakshmi, later became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly
 sabase choti bahan, krishna hathising, ek ullekhneey lekhika bani or unhone apane parivaar-janon se sambandhit kai pustaken likhin
 Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in some of the best schools and universities in the world
 unhone apni schuli shiksha hero se or college kii shiksha trinity college, cambridge se puri kii thi
 He then completed his law degree from Cambridge University
 england main unhone saat saal vyateet kiye jisamen vahaan ke fabian samaajwaad or irish rashtrawaad ke liye ek tarksangat drushtikon viksit kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru returned to India in 1912 and started advocacy
 1916 main unki shaadi kamala nehru se hui
 Jawaharlal Nehru joined the Home Rule League in 1917
 raajnneeti main unki asli diksha do saal baad 1919 main hui jab ve mahatma gandhi ke sampark main aae
 At that time Mahatma Gandhi launched a campaign against the Rowlatt Act
 nehru, mahatma gandhi ke sakriy lekin shantipurna, savinay avagya andolan ke prati khaase aakarshith hue
 Nehru also adapted his family according to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi
 jawaharlal or motilal nehru ne pashchimi kapadon or mahangi sampatti kaa tyaag kar diya
 He now started wearing a Khadi kurta and Gandhi cap
 jawahar laal nehru ne 1920-1922 main asahyog andolan main sakriy hissaa liya or is dauraan pehali baar giraftaar kiye gaye
 He was released after a few months
 jawaharlal nehru 1924 main elahabaad nagar nigam ke adhyaksh chune gaye or unhone shahar ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ke rup main do varsh tak seva kii
 He resigned in 1926 citing lack of cooperation from the British authorities
 1926 se 1928 tak, jawahar laal nehru ne akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke mahasachiv ke rup main seva kii
 In 1928-29, the annual session of the Congress was held under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 us satr main jawaharlal nehru or subhash chandra bose ne puri raajnneetik swatantraaa kii maang kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki motilal nehru or anya netaaon ne british samrajya ke bheetar hi prabhutv sampann rajya kaa darja paane kii maang kaa samarthan kiya
 To resolve the issue, Gandhi took a middle ground and said that Britain would be given two years to grant the status of the state of India and if it did not, the Congress would launch a national struggle for complete political independence
 nehru or bose ne maang kii ki is samay ko kam kar ke ek saal kar diya jaae
 The British government did not respond to this
 disambar 1929 main, congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan lahore main yojit kiya gaya jisamen jawaharlal nehru congress party ke adhyaksh chune gaye
 During this session, a resolution was also passed demanding 'complete self-rule'
 26 janvari 1930 ko lahore main jawaharlal nehru ne swatantra bharat kaa jhanda fahraaya
 Gandhiji also called for the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930
 andolan khaasaa safal rahaa or isane british sarkaar ko pramukh raajnneetik sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 When the British Government promulgated the India Act 1935, the Congress Party decided to contest elections
 nehru chunaav ke baahar rahe lekin zoron ke saath party ke liye rashtravyapee abhiyaan chalaaya
 The Congress formed governments in almost every province and won the largest number of seats in the Central Assembly
 nehru congress ke adhyaksh pad ke liye 1936 or 1937 main chune gaye the
 He was also arrested during the Quit India Movement in 1942 and released in 1945
 1947 main bharat or pakistan kii aazaadee ke samay unhone angreji sarkaar ke saath hui vaartaon main mahatvapurn bhagidaari kii
 When India got independence in 1947, when the Congress voted for the future Prime Minister, Sardar Patel got the most votes
 uske baad sarvaadhik mat acharya kriplani ko mili the
 But at the behest of Gandhiji, Sardar Patel and Acharya Kripalani withdrew their names and Jawaharlal Nehru was made the Prime Minister
 1947 main ve swatantra bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri bane
 The British had liberated around 500 princely states together and the biggest challenge at that time was to bring them under one flag
 unhone bharat ke punargathan ke raste main ubhari har chunauti kaa samajhadaari purvak saamana kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru played an important role in the making of modern India
 unhone yojana ayog kaa gathan kiya, vigyaan or praudyogiki ke vikaas ko protsaahit kiya or teen lagaataar panchavarshiya yojanaon kaa shubharambh kiya
 Due to their policies, a new era of agriculture and industry started in the country
 nehru ne bharat kii videsh niti ke vikaas main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 Jawaharlal Nehru, together with Josip Burrows Tito and Abdul Gamal Nasir, created a non-aligned movement for the elimination of colonialism in Asia and Africa
 vah korian yuddh kaa ant karne, suez nahar vivaad sulajhane or congou samjhaute ko murtarup dene jaise anya antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan main madhyasth kii bhoomika main rahe
 He also contributed significantly behind the scenes in resolving many other explosive issues like West Berlin, Austria and Laos
 unhen varsh 1955 main bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya
 But Nehru could not improve India's relations with Pakistan and China
 pakistan ke saath ek samjhaute tak pahunchne main kashmir mudda or china ke saath mitrataa main seemaa vivaad raste ke pathar sabit hue
 Nehru also extended a hand of friendship towards China, but in 1962, China attacked by deception
 nehru ke liye yah ek bada jhatka tha or shaayad unki maut bhi isi kaaran hui
 On 27 May 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru suffered a heart attack in which he died
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki nehru ne anya netaaon kii tulana main bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut kam yogadan diya tha phir bhi gandhiji ne unhe bharat kaa pratham pradhanmantri bana diya
 For several decades after independence, the heirs of power in Indian democracy have run a monarchy in the country from time to time, revered individual worship in place of ideology and completely neglected the public interest while indulging in the aura of so-called popularity
 nehru ko mahatma gandhi ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke taur janaa jaataa he
 It is also alleged on Gandhi that he did the work of advancing Nehru in politics at the expense of many able leaders including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 jab aazaadee ke thik pehle congress adhyaksh banane kii baat thi or mana ja rahaa tha ki jo congress adhyaksh banegaa vahi aaazaad bharat kaa pehla pradhanmantri hoga tab bhi gandhi ne pradesh congress samitiyon kii siforeeshon ko andekha karte hue nehru ko hi adhyaksh banane kii disha main safaltaapurvak prayaas kiya
 This creates a general belief that Nehru must have not only done the work of advancing the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi but he must have tried his best to complete the tasks which Gandhi himself could not complete
 lekin sachai iske ulat he
 It was none other than Jayaprakash Narayan, who once worked as a team with Nehru, in the role of 1978 book 'gandhi Today'
 jepi ne nehru ke bare main kuch kaha he to uski vishwasaneeyata ko lekar koi andeh nahin hona chahie kyonki nehru se jepi kii najdiki bhi thi or mitrataa bhi
 Despite this, JP highlighted the shortcomings of the Nehru model
 april 2015 main yah bhi khulaasa hua ki swatantraaa ke baad nehru ne bees varshon tak ibi dwaara netaji ke sambandhiyon kii jasusi karaayi
 Away from all political controversies, Nehru was undoubtedly a good writer
 raajnneetik kshetra main lokmaanya tilak ke baad jam kar likhane vaale netaaon main ve alag se pahachaane jate hai
 The areas of both are different, but there is a considerable amount of consistency in the writing of both
 nehru ji swabhaav se hi swadhyaayi the
 He studied great texts
 sabhi rajnatik uttejnaaon ke baavjood ve swadhyay ke liye roj hi samay nikaal liya karte the
 As a result, the books composed by him also give a simple feeling of being the creation of a study-able person
 nehru ji ne vyavasthit rup se anek pustakon kii rachana kii he
 The solution to the extreme lack of time for writing in the busiest struggling days of political life was to make the long dull days of jail a creative one
 isliye unki adhikansh pustaken jail main hi likhi gayi hai
 In his writings, a mixed form of the spirit of a litterateur and the searching heart of a historian has emerged
 indira gandhi ko kaalpanik patr likhane ke bahaane unhone vishwa itihaas kaa adhyay-dar-adhyay likh daalaa
 These letters were never actually sent, but by this, a simple communicative and well-written text like a glimpse of world history was easily prepared
 bharat kii khoj ne lokapriyata ke alag pratimaan rache hai, jis par aadhaarit bharat ek khoj naam se ek uttam dharawahik kaa nirmaan bhi hua he
 His autobiography About my story, the well-known Manishi Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan believes that his autobiography, which narrates the story of his life and struggle without trying to prove self-pity or moral superiority, is one of the most notable books of our era
 Is one of in pustakon ke atirikt nehru ji ne aganit vyaakhyaan diye, lekh likhe tathaa patr likhe
 For their publication, 'jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund' decided to publish a bibliography
 isamen sarkari chitthiyon, vijyaptiyon aadi ko chhodkar sthaayee mahatva kii samagriyon ko chunakar prakashit kiya gaya
 This booklet called Jawaharlal Nehru Valmay was published in 15 volumes in English and has been published in 11 volumes by Sasta Sahitya Mandal in Hindi
