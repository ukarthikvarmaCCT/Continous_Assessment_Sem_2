com / messenger / overview Sir Isaac Newton was a scientist from England
 jinhone gurutvkarshan kaa niyam or gati ke siddhant kii khoj kii
 He was a great mathematician, physicist, astrologer and philosopher
 inkaa shodh prapatr "prakritik darshan ke ganitiya siddhanton "" san 1687 main prakashit hua, jisamen saarvatrik gurtvakarshan evam gati ke niyamon kii vyakhya kii gai thi or is prakaar chirsmmat bhautikee kii neenv rakhi
 His Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is itself the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most literary mechanics
 is kaary main, newton ne saarvatrik gurutv or gati ke teen niyamon kaa varnan kiya jisane agali teen shatabdiyon ke liye bhautik brahmad ke vaigyanik drushtikon par apana varchasv sthapit kar liya
 Newton demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are controlled by a set of natural laws, to show that he established a continuum between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, thus Overcome past doubts about sun centrality and the modernization of the scientific revolution
 yantriki main, newton ne samveg tathaa koniya samveg donon ke sangrakshan ke siddhanton ko sthapit kiya
 In optics, he created the first practical reflective telescope and developed the theory of color on the basis that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that make up the visible spectrum
 unhone shitalan kaa niyam diya or dhwani kii gati kaa adhyayan kiya
 In mathematics, Newton credits Gottfried Leibniz with the development of the differential and integral calculus
 unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa bhi pradarshan kiya or ek falan ke shunyon ke sanniktan ke liye tathakthith "newton kii vidhi" kaa vikaas kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa ke adhyayan main yogadan diya
 Newton's position among scientists is at the very top, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists at the Royal Society of Britain, which asked whether the impact on the history of science is more profound, Newton's or Albert Einstein's Of is surveykshan main newton ko adhik prabhavi paaya gaya
 
 Newton was also highly religious, although he was an unorthodox Christian, writing more on biblical hermeneutics than the natural sciences for which he is remembered today
 ijac newton kaa janm 4 janvari 1643 ko puraani style or nai style kii tithiyaan |OS]]: 25 disambar 1642]linkolanshir ke county main ek hemelet, woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth main woolsthrope menor main hua
 At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted a Grigorian calendar and so the date of his birth was recorded as Christmas Day 25 December 1642
 newton kaa janm unke pita kii mrityu ke teen maah baad hua, ve ek samrudh kisaan the unka naam bhi ijac newton tha
 He was a small child born in a pre-mature state; His mother Hannah Ayscuff said that he could fit a small mug like a quart
 jab newton teen varsh ke the, unki maa ne dubaara shaadi kar lee or apane nae pati reverand barnabus smith ke saath rahane chali gai or apane putr ko uski nani margeri askf kii dekhbhaal main chod diya
chota ijac apane sautele pita ko pasand nahin karata tha or uske saath shaadi karne ke kaaran apni maa ke saath dushmani kaa bhav rakhata tha
 As reflected in the list of crimes committed by him until he was 19 years old: "I threatened to burn the house of mother and father Smith
" baarah varsh se satraa varsh kii aayu tak unhone di kings skool, grantham main shiksha praapt kii unhen skool se nikaal diya gaya or oktober 1659 ve woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth aa gaye, jahaan unki maan, jo duusari baar vidhwaa ho chuki thi, ne unhen kisaan banane par jor diya
 He hated farming
 kings skool ke master henry stokes ne unki maa se kaha ki ve unhen phir se skool bhej den taaki ve apni shiksha ko puraa kar saken
 Inspired by his desire for revenge against a schoolboy, he became a top-ranked student
 june 1661 main, unhen trinity college, cambridge main ek sijar-ek prakaar kii kaary-adhyayan bhoomika, ke rup main bhartee kiya gaya
 The teachings of the college at that time were based on Aristotle
 lekin newton adhik aadhunik darshanikon jaise descartes or khagolavidon jaise kopernicus, galileo or kepler ke vichaaron ko padhnaa chahta tha
 In 1665 he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory later known as the Altaipal calculus
 agast 1665 main jaise hi newton ne apni degree praapt kii, uske thik baad plig kii bheeshan mahamari se bachane ke liye ehtiyaat ke rup main vishvavidhyalay ko band kar diya
yadhyapi ve ek cambridge vidhyaarthee ke rup main pratishthit nahin the, iske baad ke do varshon tak unhone woolsthorpe main apane ghar par nijee adhyayan kiya or kalan, prakaashiki or gurutvkarshan ke niyamon par apane siddhanton kaa vikaas kiya
 In 1667 he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of Trinity
 adhikansh aadhunik itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki newton or libanij ne atyalp kalan kaa vikaas apane apane adwitiya sanketanon kaa upyog karte hue swatantra rup se kiya
 According to Newton's inner circle, Newton developed his method many years before Leibniz, but he did not publish any of his works until about 1693 and did not give a complete account of his work until 1704
 Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684
 In addition, Leibniz's notations and "methods of differentiation" were universally adopted on the continent and, after 1820, were also adopted in the British Empire
 jabaki libanij kii pustikaayen praarambhik avasthaaon se paripakvata tak vichaaron ke aadhunikeekaran ko darshaati hai, newton ke gyaat nots main keval antim parinaam hi he
 Newton said that he did not want to publish his calculus because he was afraid he would become a character of ridicule
 newton kaa swiss ganitagya nicholas fatiyo de duiliar ke saath bahut kareebi rishta tha, jo prarambh se hi newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant se bahut prabhavit the
 In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never completed it
 However, the relationship between these two men changed in 1693
 is samay, duiliar ne bhi libanij ke saath kai patron kaa aadan pradaan kiya tha
 In early 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the controversy was fully revealed in 1711
 newton kii royal socity ne ek adhyayan dwaara ghoshnaa kii ki newton hi sachche avishkaarak the or libanij ne dhokhadhadi kii thi
 The study came under suspicion when it was later found that Newton himself wrote commentary on the study's conclusion on Leibniz
 is prakaar kadava newton banaam libanij vivaad shuru ho gaya, jo baad main newton or libanij donon ke jivan main 1716 main libanij kii mrityu tak jari rahaa
 Newton is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, which is valid for any power
 unhone newton kii sarvasamikaon, newton kii vidhi, vargeekrut ghan samtal vakr kii khoj kii, parimit antaron ke siddhant main mahatvapurn yogadan diya, ve pehle vyakti the jinhone bhinnaatmak suchakank kaa prayog kiya or diophentin samikarnon ke hal ko vyutpann karne ke liye nirdeshaank jyamiti kaa upyog kiya
 He approximated the partial sum of the harmonic series by logarithms, and was the first to use the power series with confidence and the power of the power series
 unhen 1669 main ganit kaa leukesian professor chunaa gaya
 In those days, any member of Cambridge or Oxford was required to be a designated English priest
 haalaanki, leukesian professor ke liye jaruri tha ki vah carch main sakriy na ho
 Newton argued that he should be exempt from the need for coordination, and Charles II, whose permission was mandatory, accepted this argument
 is prakaar se newton ke dharmik vichaaron or angreji rudhiwaadiyon ke bich sangharsh tal gaya
 From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics
 During this period he discovered refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism dissects white light into a spectrum of colors, and a lens and a second prism combine white spectrum to form white light
 unhone yah bhi dikhaaya ki rangeen prakaash ko alag karne or bhinn vastuon par chamakaane se ragin prakaash ke gunon main koi parivartan nahin aata he
 Newton described that whether it is reflected, or radiated or transmitted, it remains of the same color
 is prakaar se, unhone dekha ki, rang pehle se rangeen prakaash ke saath vastu kii antarkriya kaa parinaam hota he naaki vasteen khud rangon ko utpann karti hai
 This is known as Newton's color theory
 is kaary se unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki, kisi bhi apvarti doordarshee kaa lens prakaash ke rangon main visaran kaa anubhav karegaa or is avadharana ko siddh karne ke liye unhone abhidrishyak ke rup main ek darpan kaa upyog karte hue, ek doordarshee kaa nirmaan kiya, taaki is samasya ko hal kiya ja sake
 darasal dizin ke nirmaan ke anusaar, pehla gyaat kriyaatmak paravarti doordarshee, aaj ek neutonian doorabeen ke rup main janaa jaataa he, isamen takanic ko aakaar dena tathaa ek upyukt darpan padaarth kii samasya ko hal karnaa shaamil he
 Newton based his mirror on a custom outfit of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to test the quality of optics for his telescope
 farvari 1669 tak ve rangeen vipathan ke bina ek upkaran kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham ho gaye
 In 1671 the Royal Society asked him to demonstrate his reflecting telescope
 un logon kii ruchi ne unhen apni tippaniyon on color ke prakaashan hetu protsaahit kiya, jise baad main unhone apni optics ke rup main vistrut kar diya
 When Robert Hooke criticized some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he dropped out of public debate
 hook kii mrityu tak donon dushman bane rahe
 Newton argued that light is made up of particles or superfluous particles, which refract as they pass through the dense medium, but it was necessary to correlate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light
 
 baad main bhautikavidon ne prakaash ke vivartan ke liye shuddh tarang jaise spashtikaran kaa samarthan kiya
 Today's quantum mechanics, the idea of photons and wave-particle coupling, bear little resemblance to Newton's understanding of light
 1675 kii unki prakaash kii pariklpana main newton ne kanon ke bich bal ke sthaanantaran hetu, ether kii upasthiti ko manjuur kiya
 His interest in alchemy revived after coming into contact with the theologian Henry More
 unhone ether ko kanon ke bich aakarshan or pratikarshan ke vayuruddh vichaaron par aadhaarit gupt balon se pratisthapit kar diya
 jon menard kenez, jinhone rasayan vidya par newton ke kai lekhon ko sweekaar kiya, kehete hai ki "newton kaaran ke yug ke pehle vyakti nahin the: ve jaaduugaron main aakhri number par the
 "newton's interest in alchemy cannot be distinguished from his contributions to science
 yadi unhone ek nirvaat main se hokar ek duuri par kriya ke gupt vichaar par bharosa nahin kiya hota to ve gurutv kaa apana siddhant viksit nahin kar pate
 In 1704 Newton published Optics, in which he explained in detail his theory of microscopic particles of light
 He considered light to be made up of very fine particles, whereas ordinary matter is made up of large particles and he said that a Through the type of chemical conversion "gross bodies and light cannot transform into each other, xxrep 7 
 and bodies from particles of light Can't get the most of their activity, who enters their organization? " Newton created a prototype form of a frictionless electrostatic generator, using a glass globe
 1677 main, newton ne phir se yantriki par apana kaary shuru kiya, arthath, gurutvkarshan or grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon ke sandarbh ke saath, grahon kii kaksha par gurutvkarshan kaa prabhaav or is vishay par hook or flemustid kaa paraamarsh
 He published his results at the De Motu Corporum in Jiram
 isamen gati ke niyamon kii shuruyaat thi jisane princepia ko suchit kiya

 ganitiya rup main ise nimnanusaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he Since the second law applies to an object of constant mass, the first term vanishes and by substitution using the definition of acceleration, the equation can be written as follows

 They are a motive of the pace of the system in the state to change the state that only one power is needed

 According to Newton's third law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction
 iskaa arth yah he ki jab bhi ek vastu kisi duusari vastu par ek bal lagaati he tab duusari vastu vipareet disha main pehali vastu par utana hi bal lagati he

 Since the objects in question do not necessarily have the same mass, the resulting acceleration of the two objects may be different
 arestu ke vipareet, newton kii bhautikee saarvatrik ho gayi he
 For example, the second law also applies to planets and a falling stone
 duusare niyam kii sadish prakruti bal kii disha or vastu ke samveg main parivartan ke prakaar ke bich ek jyamitiya sambandh sthapit karti he
 Before Newton, it was generally believed that for a planet rotating around the Sun, a forward force was required which caused it to move
 newton ne darshaya ki is ke bajaay surya kaa andar kii or ek aakarshan bal aavashyak hota he
 Even several decades after the publication of the Principia, this idea was not universally accepted
 or kai vaigyanikon ne descartes ke vortices ke siddhant ko variyata di
 Newton himself often told a story that upon seeing a falling apple from a tree, he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravity
 baad main vyangy karne ke liye aise cartoon banaaye gaye jinamein seb ko newton ke sar par girte hue bataaya gaya or yah darshaya gaya ki isi ke prabhaav ne kisi tarah se newton ko gurutv ke bal se parichit karaayaa
 unki pustikaon se gyaat hua ki 1660 ke antim samay main newton kaa yah vichaar tha ki sthaliy gurutv kaa vistaar hota he, yah chandramaa ke varg vyutkramanupati hota he; haalaanki purna siddhant ko viksit karne main unhen do dashak kaa samay laga
 John Kanaduyt, who was Newton's associate at the Royal Mint and also the husband of Newton's niece, described the incident when he wrote about Newton's life: 1666 main ve cambridge se phir se sevanivrutt ho gaye or apni maa ke paas linkanshair chale gaye
 As he was walking in a garden, he got an idea that the power of gravity is not limited to a certain distance from the earth, but this power can extend far beyond what was previously thought
 unhone apane aap se kaha ki kya aisa utana upar bhi hoga jitna upar chaand he or yadi aisa he to, yah uski gati ko prabhavit karegaa or sambhavatya use uski kaksha main banaaye rakhega, ve jo gananaa kar rahe the, is tark kaa kya prabhaav hua
 The question was not about the existence of gravity, but whether this force is so wide that it is responsible for keeping the moon in its orbit
 newton ne darshaya ki yadi bal duuri ke varg vyutkram main kam hota he to, chandramaa kii kakshiya avadhi kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or acha parinaam praapt ho saktaa he
 He speculated that this force is responsible for other orbital motion and hence gave it the name of universal gravitation
 ek samakaleen lekhak, wiliam stukele, sar ijac newton kii zindagi ko apane samaran main ricord karte hai, ve 15 april 1726 ko kencinghton main newton ke saath hui baatcheet ko yaad karte hai, jab newton ne zikr kiya ki "unke dimag main gurutv kaa vichaar pehle kab aayaa
 This happened because of an apple falling while he was sitting in meditation posture
 kyon yah seb hameshaa bhoomi ke saapeksh lambavat main hi kyon girtaa he? aisa unhone apane aap main sochaa
 Why it does not move to the side or up, but always falls towards the center of the earth
 " isi prakaar ke shabdon main, volter mahakavy kavita par niabandh main likhaa, "sar ijac newton kaa apane baganon main gum rahe the, ped se girte hue ek seb ko dekh kar, unhone gurutvkarshan kii pranali ke bare main pehali baar sochaa
 The various trees are claimed to be "that" apple tree which Newton has described
 di kings skool, grantham daawa karata he ki yah ped skool ke dwaara kharid liya gaya tha, kuch saalon baad ise jad sahit laakar pradhanadhyaapak ke bageeche main laga diya gaya
 The current staff at the National Trust, which owns Woolstrop Manor, disputs this, and claims that the tree is present in their garden about which Newton talked
 mul vriksh kaa vanshaj trinity college, cambridge ke mukhya dwaar ke baahar uga hua dekha ja saktaa he, yah us kamare ke neeche he jisamen newton padhai ke samay rahata tha

 In this marriage too, Akbar did the same, which had been doing before that due to the relationship of marriage, mutual tension and old bitterness was ended

 The distance from the stars through which light comes in eight thousand years, we have measured a quarter to twenty-four padma mi
 lekin taare to itani itani duuri par hai ki unase prakaash ke aane main lakhon, karodon, arabon varsh lag jaataa he

 In the field of cosmology, some important things have come up due to the discoveries of the last few years
 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth
 mount polomer vedhashala main sthit 200 inch vyasavaale lens kii doorabeen se khagol shastriyon ne akaash gangaaon ke dur hatane kii prakriya ko dekha he
 When we look at the universe with a telescope, we feel that we are the center of this universe and other things are running away from us
 yadi anya akaash gangaaon main prekshak bheje jaaen to ve bhi yahi paaenge ki is brahmad ke centre bindu hai, baaki akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary
 yah vah samay tha jab ki ainstin kaa saapekshavaad kaa siddhant apni shaishvavastha main tha

 After all, here Einstein misinformed Newton's letter

 Three concepts of the origin of the universe are presented xxrep 4 - 1
 sthir avasthaa kaa siddhant 2
 Explosion Theory and 3
 dolan siddhant
 The second assumption is more important in these assumptions
 is dharna ke anusaar brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he or isi kaaran akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi he
 If you put the inverted picture of this universe in front of you, then you will see the universe becoming disheveled, and the sky will appear as if the Ganges is not running
 at: kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kisi samay koi mahapind rahaa hoga or usee ke visphot hone ke kaaran akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Explosion theory is also confirmed by the discovery of new wires called quasars and pulsars

 There are a lot of facts related to this, how much water sold in bottles is a part of such a big business
 yah kaarobaar antarrashtriya str se lekar sthaneey str tak pahunch gaya he
 Over the last decade, bottled water sales have increased dramatically over a period of time and the business has grown to over US $ 100 billion
 varsh 1999 se lekar 2004 tak sari duniya main bikne vaale bottleband pani kii khapat kareeb 118 arab litre se badhkar 182 arab litre se adhik tak ho gai he
 Bottled water consumption is increasing in many cities of the developing world because the local administration of the cities has failed to provide adequate amount of pure drinking water to the people despite having sufficient water
 iske parinaam swaroop vikasshil deshon main bottleband pani kaa utpaadan karne vaali companiyaan bade paimaane par paisa kama rahi hai
 In the year 2004, the sale of bottled water in America was more than any other country
 30
8 arab litre pani ke liye 9 arab america dollar se adhik kii raashi chukaai gai
 This quantity is so high that it can meet the annual water requirements of the entire population of Cambodia
 bottleband pani kii sabase zyada khapat vaale das sheersh deshon main america, mexico, china, brazil, italy, germany, france, indonesia, spain or bharat hai
 When users of bottled water are asked why do they spend so much money on water when they can get tap water easily? He says that he prefers bottled water because it is more pure and healthier
 zyaadaatar companiyaan apane utpaada ko yah kahkar bechati hai ki vah nal ke pani se zyada surakshit he lekin is maamle main vibhinn adhyayanon kaa kahana he ki bottleband pani se jude niyam vastav main itane aparyaapt hai ki ve shuddhta yaa suraksha sunishchit nahin kar sakate hai
 In this case, the World Health Organization says that bottled water may actually contain more bacteria than municipal corporation tap water

 At least 70 percent of China's rivers and lakes are polluted and most cities seeking bottled water are residents because people in rural areas are so poor that they cannot afford to drink so much expensive water

 inhen aadhunik kaal ke mahanatam ganit vichaarkon main gina jaataa he
 He did not get any special training in mathematics, yet he made deep contributions in the areas of analysis and number theory
 inhone apane pratibha or lagan se na keval ganit ke kshetra main adbhut avishkaar kiye varan bharat ko athulaneey gaurav bhi pradaan kiya
 He was a brilliant genius since childhood
 inhone khud se ganit siikhaa or apane jeevanabhar main ganit ke 3,884 pramayon kaa sankalan kiya
 Most of these theorems have been proved correct
 inhone ganit ke sahaj gyaan or bijganit prakalan kii adwitiya pratibha ke bal par bahut se moulik or aparmparik parinaam nikaale jinase prerit shodh aaj tak ho rahaa he, yadhyapi inaki kuch khojon ko ganit mukhyadhara main ab tak nahin apanaaya gaya he
 Recently their formulas have been used in crystal science
 inke kaary se prabhavit ganit ke kshetron main ho rahe kaam ke liye ramanujan jarnal kii sthapana kii gai he
 Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 in the village of Erode, Coimbatore, in the southern part of India
 vah paaramparik brahman parivaar main janme the
 His mother's name was Komaltammal and his father's name was Srinivasa Iyengar
 inkaa bachapan mukhyatah kumbhakonam main beetaa tha jo ki apane pracheen mandiron ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Ramanujan's intellectual development in childhood was not like that of ordinary children
 yah teen varsh kii aayu tak bolnaa bhi nahin sikh paae the
 When Ramanujan did not start speaking till such a great age, everyone was worried that he would be dumb
 baad ke varshon main jab unhone vidhyalay main pravesh liya to bhi paaramparik shiksha main inkaa kabhi bhi man nahin laga
 Ramanujan attained the highest marks in the entire district in the primary examination at the age of ten and reached the town high school for further education
 ramanujan ko prashn poochna bahut pasand tha
 His questions sometimes seemed very strange to the teachers
 jaise ki-sansar main pehla purush koun tha? prithvi or badalon ke bich kii duuri kitni hoti he? ramanujan kaa vyavhaar bada hi madhur tha
 His somewhat more gross body and glowing eyes of curiosity gave him a different identity
 inke sahpaathiyon ke anusaar inkaa vyavhaar itnaa saumy tha ki koi inase naaraaz ho hi nahin saktaa tha
 His talent in the school started making a mark on other students and teachers
 inhone skool ke samay main hi kalege ke str ke ganit ko pard liya tha
 Once the headmaster of his school had also said that the criteria for examinations to be held in the school does not apply to Ramanujan
 hiskool kii pariksha uteern karne ke baad inhen ganit or angreji me achche ank laane ke kaaran subramanyam chaatravrutti mili or aage kalege kii shiksha ke liye pravesh bhi mila
 a further problem occurred
 ramanujan kaa ganit ke prati prem itnaa bad gaya tha ki ve duusare vishyon par dhyaan hi nahin dete the
 He used to solve mathematics questions even in history, biology classes
 nateeja yah hua ki gyarahavin kaksha kii pariksha main ve ganit ko chhod kar baaki sabhi vishyon main fail ho gaye or parinamswaroop unako chaatravrutti milani band ho gai
 One, the financial condition of the house was poor and scholarship was not being received from above
 ramanujan ke liye yah bada hi kathin samay tha
 He also did some maths tuition and ledger work to improve the condition of the house
 kuch samay baad 1907 main ramanujan ne phir se barahavin kaksha kii privet pariksha di or anuteern ho gaye
 And with this, their traditional education was celebrated
 vidhyalay chhodane ke baad kaa paanch varshon kaa samay inke liye bahut hataasha bharaa tha
 At this time India was caught in the shackles of subordination
 chaaron taraf bhayankar garibi thi
 At such a time, Ramanujan had neither a job nor an opportunity to work with any institute or professor
 bas unka ishwar par atoot vishwaas or ganit ke prati agaadh shraddha ne unhen kartavya maarg par chalane ke liye sadaiv prerit kiya
 Namgiri Devi was the Ishta Devi of Ramanujan's family
 unke prati atoot vishwaas ne unhen kahin rukne nahin diya or ve itani vipareet paristhitiyon main bhi ganit ke apane shodh ko chalaate rahe
 At this time Ramanujan used to get a total of five rupees monthly from tuition and lived in it
 ramanujan kaa yah jivan kaal bahut ksht or dukh se bharaa tha
 He always had to wander around to maintain his education and continue his education and had to plead unsuccessfully to many people
 varsh 1908 main inke mata pita ne inkaa vivaah janaki naamak kanya se kar diya
 After marriage, it was no longer possible for them to forget everything and drown in mathematics
 atah ve naukari kii talash main madras aae
 He did not get a job due to not passing the XII examination and his health also fell badly
 ab doctor kii salaah par inhen waapas apane ghar kumbhakonam lautnaa padaa
 After recovering from illness, he came back to Madras and started looking for a job again
 ye jab bhi kisi se milte the to use apana ek register dikhaate the
 This register contained all the work done by him in mathematics
 isi samay kisi ke kehane par ramanujan vahaan ke dipti colector shri ve
 ramasvami ayyar se mili
 Iyer was a great scholar of mathematics
 yahaan par shri ayyar ne ramanujan kii pratibha ko pahachaanaa or jiladhikari shri ramchandra raav se kah kar inke liye 25 rupaye masik chaatravrutti kaa prabandh bhi kar diya
 On this instinct, Ramanujan published his first research paper in Madras for a year
 shodh patr kaa sheershak tha "barnauli sankhyaon ke kuch gun” or yah shodh patr jarnal of indian mathematical socity main prakashit hua tha
 After completing one year here, he worked as a clerk in Madras Port Trust
 saubhaahgya se is naukari main kaam kaa boj kuch zyada nahin tha or yahaan inhen apane ganit ke liye paryaapt samay miltaa tha
 Here Ramanujan used to stay awake all night and write new mathematical formulas and then take a rest for a while and then leave for office
 ramanujan ganit ke shodhon ko slate par likhte the
 And later wrote it down in a register
 raat ko ramanujan ke slate or khadie kii aawaaj ke kaaran parivaar ke anya sadasyon kii neend chaupat ho jaati thi
 At this time there was a great distance between Indian and Western living and due to this Indians were generally very hesitant to present their things to the British scientists
 idhar sthiti kuch aisi thi ki bina kisi angrej ganitagya kii sahaayta liye shodh kaary ko aage nahin badhaayaa ja saktaa tha
 At this time Ramanujan's old well wishers came to his work and these people sent the work done by Ramanujan to the famous mathematicians of London
 par yahaan inhen kuch vishesh sahaayta nahin mili lekin ek laabh yah hua ki log ramanujan ko thodaa bahut jaanane lage the
 At the same time, Ramanujan showed some formulas of his number theory to Professor Seshu Iyer, then he turned his attention to Professor Hardy of London
 professor hardi us samay ke vishwa ke prasiddh ganitagyon main se ek the
 And was known for his strict nature and discipline
 professor hardi ke shodhakarya ko padhane ke baad ramanujan ne bataaya ki unhone professor hardi ke anuttarit prashn kaa uttar khoj nikaala he
 Now Ramanujan's correspondence with Professor Hardy began
 ab yahaan se ramanujan ke jivan main ek nae yug kaa sutarapaat hua jisamen professor hardi kii bahut badi bhoomika thi
 In other words, the way a jeweler identifies a diamond and shines it, Professor Hardy has some similar place in Ramanujan's life
 professor hardi aaajeevan ramanujan kii pratibha or jivan darshan ke prashansak rahe
 This friendship of Ramanujan and Professor Hardy proved beneficial for both
 ek tarah se dekha jaae to dono ne ek duusare ke liye poorak kaa kaam kiya
 Professor Hardy valued various talented people of that time on a scale of 100
 adhikansh ganitagyon ko unhone 100 main 35 ank die or kuch vishisht vyaktiyon ko 60 ank die
 But he gave Ramanujan a full 100 in 100 points
 aarambh main ramanujan ne jab apane kiye gaye shodhakarya ko professor hardi ke paas bheja to pehle unhen bhi puraa samaj main nahin aayaa
 When he consulted his friend mathematicians, he came to the conclusion that Ramanujan is a rare personality in the field of mathematics and that he should come to England to understand the work done by him and to further research in it
 atah unhone ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye aamantrit kiya
 For some personal reasons and lack of funds, Ramanujan declined Professor Hardy's invitation to Cambridge
 professor hardi ko isse niraashaa hui lekin unhonen kisi bhi tarah se ramanujan ko vahaan bulaane kaa nishchay kiya
 At the same time, Ramanujan got a research career at the University of Madras, which made his life a bit easier and he was also getting full time for research work
 isi bich ek lambey patravyavhaar ke baad dhire-dhire professor hardi ne ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye sahamat kar liya
 Ramanujan was also funded by Professor Hardy's efforts to go to Cambridge
 ramanujan ne england jane ke pehle ganit ke kareeb 3000 se bhi adhik naye sutron ko apni notebook main likhaa tha
 Ramanujan stepped on the land of London
 vahaan professor hardi ne unke liye pehle se vvavastha kii hui thi atah inhen koi vishesh pareshaani nahin hui
 Ramanujan had little trouble in England and the reason for this was his shy, calm nature and pure satvic lifestyle
 apane puure england pravaas main ve adhikanshtah apana bhojan swayan banaate the
 This journey of England brought a revolutionary change in his life
 unhone professor hardi ke saath mil kar ucchkoti ke shodhpatr prakashit kiye
 Due to his special research he was awarded BA by Cambridge University
 Also got the title of
 lekin vahaan kii jalwaayu or rahan-sahan kii style unke adhik anukool nahin thi or unka swasthya kharaab rahane laga
 The doctors called it tuberculosis
 us samay kshay rog kii koi dawa nahin hoti thi or rogi ko senetorium me rahanaa padataa tha
 Ramanujan also had to stay there for a few days
 vahaan is samay bhi yah ganit ke sutron main nai nai kalpanaaen kiya karte the
 After this, Ramanujan was named a Fellow of the Royal Society
 aise samay main jab bharat gulaami main ji rahaa tha tab ek ashwet vyakti ko royal socity kii sadsyta milanaa ek bahut badi baat thi
 In the entire history of the Royal Society, there has been no member younger than them till date
 puure bharat main unke shubhachintakon ne utsav manaaya or sabhaayen kii
 After membership of the Royal Society, he also became the first Indian to get the fellowship of Trinity College
 ab aisa lag rahaa tha ki sab kuch bahut acchhee jagah par ja rahaa he
 But Ramanujan's health was deteriorating and eventually he had to return to India on the advice of doctors
 bharat aane par inhen madras vishvavidhyalay main praadhyaapak kii naukari mil gai
 And Ramanujan was rekindled in teaching and research
 bharat lautne par bhi swasthya ne inkaa saath nahin diya or haalat gambhir hoti ja rahi thi
 In the case of this disease also, he wrote a high level research paper on mock theta function
 ramanujan dwaara pratipaadit is falan kaa upyog ganit hi nahin balki chikitsavigyaan main cancer ko samajhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 His declining health became a matter of concern for all and even now doctors have given him the answer
 ant main ramanujan ke vidaa kii ghadi aa hi gai
 In the morning of 26 April 1920, he became unconscious and by midday he gave up his life
 is samay ramanujan kii aayu maatr 33 varsh thi
 His untimely demise was an irreparable loss to the mathematics world
 puure desh videsh main jisane bhi ramanujan kii mrityu kaa samachar suna vahiin stabdh ho gaya
 Ramanujan and most of the work done by him still remains an enigma for scientists
 ek bahut hi saamaanya parivaar main janm le kar puure vishwa ko aashcharyachakit karne kii apni is yatra main inhone bharat ko apurv gaurav pradaan kiya
 His old register on which he used to write his theorems and formulas was suddenly found in the library of Trinity College in 1976
 kareeb ek sau pannon kaa yah register aaj bhi vaigyanikon ke liye ek paheli bana hua he
 This register was later known as Ramanujan's note book
 mumbai ke tata moolbhoot anusandhan santhaan dwaara iskaa prakaashan bhi kiya gaya he
 Like Ramanujan's researches, his style of working in mathematics was also bizarre
 ve kabhi kabhi aadhi raat ko sote se jaag kar slate par ganit se sutara likhane lagate the or phir so jate the
 In this way it seemed that they were solving mathematics questions even in their dreams
 ramanujan ke naam ke saath hi unki kuladevi kaa bhi naam liya jaataa he
 He always kept in mind zero and infinite and used the mathematical formulas to explain its interrelationships
 ramanujan ke kaary karne kii ek visheshta thi
 Earlier, he used to write a new formula or theorem of mathematics but did not pay much attention to its origin
 iske bare main puche jane par ve kehete the ki yah sutara unhen namgiri devi kii krupa se praapt hue hai
 Ramanujan's faith in spirituality was so deep that he considered any work done in the field of mathematics as a part of spirituality
 ve dharm or aadhyatm main keval vishwaas hi nahin rakhte the balki use taarkik rup se prastut bhi karte the
 He used to say that "for me that mathematics formula does not mean that i do not get spiritual thoughts
" ” Ramanujan worked mainly in the field of number theory in England for five years
 ramanujan ne nimnlikhit sutara pratipaadit kiya- The specialty of this formula is that it expresses the relation of the two most famous constants of mathematics through an infinite continuous fraction
 pai ke liye unhone ek doosraa sutara bhi diya tha- 'ramanujan number' is a natural number that can be represented in two different ways by the sum of cubes of two numbers
 udhaaharan - 9 3 + 10 3 = 1 3 + 12 3 = 1729 { \ displaystyle 9^{3}+10^{3}=1^{3}+12^{3}=1729} 
 Similarly, atah 1729, 4104, 20683, 39312, 40033 aadi ramanujan sankhyaayein hai

 Photosynthesis is the process of converting optical energy into chemical energy by living cells
 prakaash sanshleshan vah kriya he jisamen paudhe apane hare rang vaale ango jaise pattee, dwaara surya ke prakaash kii upasthiti main vaayu se carbondioxide tathaa bhoomi se jal lekar jatil carbonic khaadya padaarthon jaise carbohydrates kaa nirmaan karte hai tathaa oxygen gas baahar nikaalte hai
 In the process of photosynthesis, simple carbohydrates and later complex carbohydrates are formed by the addition of carbon dioxide and water inside the cells of green leaves of plants in the presence of sunlight
 is prakriya main oxygen evam urja se bharpoor carbohydrate aadi) kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxygen gas baahar nikalati he
 Water, carbon dioxide, sunlight and chlorophyll are called components of photosynthesis
 isamen se jal tathaa carbondioxide ko prakaash sanshleshan kaa kaccha maal kaha jaataa he
 The process of photosynthesis is one of the most important biochemical reactions
 sidhe yaa paroksh rup se duniya ke sabhi sajiv is par ashrith hai
 Animals that transmit light are called autotrophs
 prakaash yahan abhikriya main bhaag nahin letaa he balki is abhikriya ke liye prakaash kii upasthiti aavashyak he
 This chemical reaction involves chemical reactions between 6 molecules of carbon dioxide and 12 molecules of water, resulting in one molecule of glucose, 6 molecules of water and 6 molecules of oxygen
 is kriya main mukhya utpaada glucose hota he tathaa oxigen or jal up padaarth ke rup main mukt hote hai
 The water produced in this reaction is absorbed by the cell and then reoccur in biochemical reactions
 mukt oxigen vaataavaran main chali jaati he
 The source of this free oxygen is water molecules, not carbon dioxide molecules
 abhikriya main surya kii vikiran urja kaa roopaantaran rasinic urja main hota he
 Which accumulate in glucose molecules
 prakaash-sanshleshan main paudhon dwaara prati varsh lagbhag 100 terrawatt kii saurya urja ko rasinic urja ke rup main bhojya padaarth ke anuon main band diya jaataa he
 The magnitude of this energy is 7 times more than the annual energy expenditure of the entire human civilization
 yah urja yahan sthitij urja ke rup main sanchit rahati he
 Hence, the process of photosynthesis is also called energy bonding
 is prakaar prakaash-sanshleshan karne vaale sajiv lagbhag 10,00,00,00,000 ton carbon ko prati varsh jaev-padaarthon main badal dete hai
 It has been known since ancient times that plants get their nutrition through roots
 1772 main stephen heles ne bataaya ki paudhon kii pattiyaan vaayu se bhojan grahan karti hai tathaa is kriya main prakaash kii kuch mahatvapurn kriya he
 Priestley first told in 1772 that if a candle is lit in the air generated during this process, it keeps on burning
 mombatti jalane ke pashchaat utpann vaayu main yadi ab ek jivit chuha rakhaa jaye to vah mar jaataa he
 He again stated in 1775 that the gas released by the plants during the day is oxygen
 iske pashchaat ingine house ne 1779 main bataaya ki hare paudhe surya ke prakaash main co2 grahan karte hai tathaa oxygen nikaalte hai
 D
 Sasur told in 1804 that plants take oxygen only in respiration day and night, but they release oxygen during photosynthesis
 at: oxijan puure din kaam me aati he par carbon daai oksaide se oxijan keval prakaash sanshleshan me hi banati he
 Mother-in-law reported in 1887 that starch is produced in plants by ingesting CO2 and extracting o2 of green plants
 hare paudhon main hone vaali prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya paudhon evam anya jivit praaniyon ke liye ek bahut hi mahatvapurn kriya he
 In this process, plants convert sunlight energy into chemical energy and complex carbon compounds become carbohydrates from simple substances like CO2 water
 in carbohydrates dwaara hi manushya evam jivit praaniyon ko bhojan praapt hota he
 In this way, plants make food for the whole animal world by the process of photosynthesis
 carbohydrates protein evam vitamin aadi ko praapt karne ke liye vibhinn fasalein ugaai jaati hai tathaa in sab padaarthon kaa nirmaan prakaash sanshleshan dwaara hi hota he
 Rubber, plastics, oils, cellulose and many drugs are also produced in photosynthesis in plants
 hare vriksh prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main carbon dioxide ko lete hai or oxigen ko nikaalte hai, is prakaar vaataavaran ko shuddh karte hai
 Oxygen is essential for all animals to breathe
 paryaavaran ke sangrakshan ke liye bhi is kriya kaa bahut mahatv he
 Photosynthesis is also very important for fisheries
 jab prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya dhimi ho jaati he to jal main carbon daai oxide kii maatra bad jaati he
 Its exceeding 5 cc per liter is harmful for fisheries
 prakaash sanshleshan jaev eendhan banane main bhi sahaayak hota he
 Through this, plants also produce biofuels through solar energy
 yah jaev eendhan vibhinn prakriya se guzarate hue vividh urja sroton kaa utpaadan karata he
 For example fodder for animals, instead of which we get cow dung, cooking food through agricultural residues etc
 manushya ke atirikt anya jeev jantuon main bhi prakaash-sanshleshan kaa bahut mahatv he
 Humans synthesize vitamin d in their skin through light
 vitamin di ek vasa main ghulansheel rasayan he, iske sanshleshan main parabangnee kirnon kaa prayog hota he
 Some sea snails ingest algae etc
 plants through their diet and use the chloroplasts present in them for photosynthesis
 prakaash-sanshleshan evam shwasan kii kriyaayein ek duusare kii poorak evam vipareet hoti hai
 In photosynthesis, the chemical reaction between carbon dioxide and water results in the formation of glucose and release of oxygen
 shwasan main iske vipareet glucose ke oxikaran ke falswaroop jal tathaa carbondioxide banati hai
 Photosynthesis is a creative activity that results in an increase in the dry weight of living organisms
 shwasan ek nasaatmak kriya he, is kriya ke falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main kami aati he
 Food is produced by the use of solar energy in photosynthesis, radiation energy is converted into chemical energy
 jabaki shwasan main bhojan ke oxikaran se urja mukt hoti he, bhojan main sanchit rasinic urja kaa prayog sajiv apane vibhinn kaaryon main karata he
 Thus, these two activities complement each other by relying on each other's end products for their raw materials
 prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya keval hare paudhon se hoti he or sameekaran atyant saadhaaran he
 Nevertheless, it is a controversial question as to how simple substances like CO2 and water make complex substances like carbohydrates
 samay-samay par vibhinn padap karyiki visheshgyon ne is kriya ko samajhane ke liye vibhinn mat prakat kiye hai
 Among them are the votes of Baird, Wilsetter and Staal and Arnone
 baiyar, willstator tathaa stall ke maton kaa keval aitihaasik mahatv he
 These were not found to be correct in subsequent tests
