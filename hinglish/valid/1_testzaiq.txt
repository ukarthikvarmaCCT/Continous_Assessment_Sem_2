 According to Mahabharata, almost all the districts of India participated in this war

 Millions of Kshatriya warriors were killed in this war, which resulted in the collapse of Vedic culture and civilization

 In the Mahabharata, there are accounts of the war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, mainly of two families of lunar dynasties

 mahabharat yuddh hone kaa mukhya kaaran kauravon kii ucch mahatvakankshaayen or dhritarashtra kaa putr moh tha
 The Kauravas and the Pandavas were siblings
 vedavyas ji se niyog ke dwaara vichitraveery kii bharya ambika ke garbh se dhritarashtra or ambalika ke garbh se pandu utpann hue
 Dhritarashtra gave birth to a hundred sons from Gandhari's womb, Duryodhana being the eldest
 pandu ke yudhisthir, bhim, arjuna, nakul, sahadev aadi paanch putr hue| dhritarashtra janm se hi netraheen the atah unki jagah par pandu ko raaj diya gaya jisase dhritarashtra ko sadaa pandu or uske putron se dwesh rahane laga
 This malice flourished as Duryodhana and Shakuni made ghee in this fire
 shakuni ke kehane par duryodhana ne bachapan se lekar laakshagrih tak kai shadyantra kiye
 But every time he failed
 yuvavastha main aane par jab yudhisthir ko yuvaraj bana diya gaya to usne unhen laakshagrih bhijwakar maarane kii koshish kii parantu pandav batch nikle
 In the absence of the Pandavas, Dhritarashtra made Duryodhana the crown prince, but when the Pandavas returned and sought their kingdom back, they were given a ruined Khandav forest in the name of the state
 dhritarashtra ke anurodh par grihayuddh ke sankat se bachane ke liye yudhisthir ne yah prastaav bhi sweekaar kar liya
 The Pandavas built Indraprastha, the grand city of Indra's Amaravati Puri, with the help of Shri Krishna
 pandavon ne vishwavijay karke prachur maatra main ratna evam dhan ekatrit kiya or rajasuya yajna kiya
 Duryodhana could not see the progress of the Pandavas and with the help of Shakuni, he won his entire kingdom from Yudhishthira in gaming and humiliated Draupadi by attempting to disarm Draupadi in the Kuru Rajya Sabha
 sambhavtah isi din mahabharat ke yuddh ke beej pad gayi the
 Finally, after losing in gaming, the Pandavas had to accept confinement for 12 years and one year of exile
 parantu jab yah shart puri karne par bhi kauravon ne pandavon ko unka rajya dene se manaa kar diya
 So the Pandavas had to be interrupted to fight, but Shri Krishna suggested to do everything possible to stop the war
 tab shrikrishna pandavon kii taraf se kururajya sabha main shantidoot banakar gayi or vahaan shrikrishna ne duryodhana se pandavon ko keval paanch gaanv dekar yuddh taalane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 But when Duryodhana refused to give the Pandavas as much land as the needle point, Yudhishthira was eventually forced to fight
 is prakaar kauravon ne 11 akshuhinee tathaa pandavon ne 7 akshuhinee sena ekatrit kar lee
 After completing the preparations for the war, both the Kaurava and the Pandavas reached Kurukshetra, where this fierce battle was fought, that terrible and fierce exterminatorial war of Kurukshetra can be inferred from a verse in Bhishma festival of Mahabharata
 bhrata bhraataram tatra swasriyan na c matulah
 Even after fulfilling the condition of 12 years of life and 1 year of unknown life, when the Kauravas refused to give their kingdom to the Pandavas, the Pandavas were forced to fight
 parantu shrikrishna ne kaha ki yah yuddh sampoorn vishwa sabhyataa ke vinaash kaa kaaran ban saktaa he atah unhone yuddh rokane kaa har sambhav prayaas karne kaa suzav diya
 Sri Krishna said that Duryodhana must give one last chance, so Sri Krishna went on behalf of the Pandavas as a peacekeeper in the Kurujya Sabha and proposed to avoid war by giving Duryodhana only five villages in front of the Pandavas
 jab duryodhana ne pandavon ko sui kii nonk jitani bhi bhoomi dene se manaa kar diya to shrikrishna ne use samajhaayaa ki duryodhana ke is hath ke kaaran uske vansh or saathiyon ke saath-saath kai nirdosh logon ko yuddh kii bali chadhana padegaa
 Enraged at this, Duryodhana tried to make Sri Krishna a prisoner, but Shri Krishna used Maya to frighten everyone out of his vast form and left
 iske baad to yudhisthir ko yuddh karne ke liye vivash hona hi padaa
 At the same time, Lord Ved Vyas went to Dhritarashtra and said that your sons, by disregarding the talk of all the gurus, finally put up a great destructive war
 dhritarashtra ke yuddh kii sansuchana jaanane kii vinati karne par vedavyas ji ne unhe kaha ki yadi tum is mahayuddh ko dekhnaa chaahate ho to main tumhen divya drushti pradaan kar saktaa hoon
 Dhritarashtra said that the destruction of my family is to be done in it, so i will not see this war with my own eyes
 atah aap krupa karke aisi vyavastha kar den ki mujhe is yuddh kaa samachar miltaa rahe
 Hearing this, Ved Vyas called Sanjay and gave him a divine vision and said, “oh Dhritarashtra! i have given Sanjay a divine vision
 sampoorn yuddh kshetra main koi bhi baat aisi na rahegi jo isse chuphi rahe
 This will tell you the whole story of this great war
 ” itnaa kahkar vedavyas ji chale gayi
 When it was decided that there would be war, both sides started preparations for war
 duryodhana pichle 13 varshon se hi yuddh kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha, usne balram ji se gada yuddh kii shiksha praapt kii tathaa kathin parishram or abhyaas se gada yuddh karne main bhim se bhi acha ho gaya
 Shakuni turned most of the districts of the world in these years
 duryodhana karn ko apni sena kaa senapati bananaa chahta tha parantu shakuni ke samajhane par duryodhana ne pitamah bhishma ko apni sena kaa senapati banaaya, jiske kaaran bharat or vishwa ke kai janapad duryodhana ke paksh me ho gayi
 On the Pandavas side, only those districts were in favor of religion and Shri Krishna
 mahabharat ke anusaar mahabharat kaal main kururajya vishwa kaa sabase bada or shaktishaalee janapad tha
 All the districts of the world never made the mistake of going to war with Kurujya and maintained a cordial relationship
 at: sabhi janapad kuruon dwaara labhanvit hone ke lobh se yuddh main unki sahaayta karne ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 When the Pandavas and Kauravas asked for help from the Yadavas, Sri Krishna first vowed not to take up arms in the war and then said that "on one side i am alone and on the other side i have an Akshauhini Narayani army", now Arjuna and Duryodhana elect one of these Had to do
 arjuna ne to shrikrishna ko hi chunaa, tab shrikrishna ne apni ek akshuhinee sena duryodhana ko de di or khud arjuna kaa sarathi bananaa sweekaar kiya
 In this way, the Kauravas collected 11 Akshauhini and the Pandavas collected 7 Akshauhini army
 phir shrikrishna ne karn se milakar use yah samajhaayaa ki vah pandavon kaa hi bhai he atah vah pandavon kii taraf se yuddh kare, parantu karn ne duryodhana ke rin or mitrataa ke kaaran kauravon kaa saath nahin choda
 After this, on requesting Kunti, Karna promised not to kill Arjuna except for the remaining four of his sons when he got the opportunity
 idhar indra ne bhi brahman kaa vesh banaakar karn se uske kavach or kundal le liye
 Due to which the power of Karna was reduced and the enthusiasm of the Pandavas increased because Karna could not be killed by any diva due to that impenetrable armor
 pandavon or kauravon ne apni sena ke kramshah 7 or 11 vibhaag akshuhinee main kiye
 An Akshauhini consists of 21, 870 chariots, 21, 870 elephants, 65, 610 riders and 1,09,350 foot soldiers
 yah pracheen bharat main sena kaa maap hua karata tha
 Each chariot consists of four horses and their charioteer
 Each elephant sits on its elephant, and behind it is its assistant who curbs the elephant from behind the chair, its owner in the chair is fitted with a bow and arrow and with it his two companions There are those who throw spears
 Accordingly the number of people who ride on chariots and elephants are 2, 84, 323
 All the living beings in an Akshohini army - elephants, horses and humans - Mr
 Print 6, 34, 243 happen, so 18 akshauhini total number of all Jivdharion- elephants, horses and men in army-1, will be 14, 16, 374
 atharah akshuhiniyon ke liye yahi sankhya 11, 416 ,374 ho jaati he arthath 3, 93, 660 hathi, 27, 55, 620 ghode, 82, 67, 094 manushya
 Many types of weapons were used in the war of Mahabharata
 praas, rishti, tomars, lohamay kanap, chakra, mudgar, naraach, farse, gofan, bhushundi, shatghni, dhanush-baan, gada, bhaalaa, talwaar, parigh, bhindipal, shakti, musal, kampan, chaap, divyastra, ek saath kai baan chhodane vaali yantric mashine
 Weapons of ancient bronze age kaansya yug kii talwaar 1800 BC iron arrow piece found in excavation in Dadupur village of Lucknow ek saath kai baan chhodane vaali yantric mashine In ancient times, during the time of war, the commander had to make many arrays of army so that the enemy's army could be easily penetrated and the king and the chief generals could be captured or killed
 isamen apni sampoorn sena ko vyuh ke naam yaa gun vaali ek vishesh akruti me vyavasthit kiya jaataa he
 With this type of array of composition, even the smallest army can appear to be huge and can face the largest army as in the battle of Mahabharata, only 7 Akshohini army of Pandavas proved this by facing 11 Akshauhini army of Kaurava

 The Pandavas made their halt near the banks of Hiranyavati River, far away from the Samantpanchak Tirtha, situated on the southern bank of the Saraswati River in the western region of Kurukshetra, and the Kauravas made a halt in the eastern part of Kurukshetra at a plain level a few miles away

 Duryodhana also made thousands of stops in the same way, only the siege of 5 plan was left for war between the two armies
 phir agle din praatah donon paksho kii senaayen ek duusare ke aamane-saamne aakar khadi ho gayin
 The Pandavas put their army stop near the Samantra Panchak Tirtha and the Kauravas made their stop seeing the best and level place

 On the advice of Pitamah Bhishma, both parties gathered and made some rules of war
 unke banaaye hue niyam nimnlikhit hai- In this way, by making war rules, both parties presented for war
 pandavon ke paas saat akshuhinee sena thi or kauravon ke saath gyaarah akshuhinee sena thi
 The armies of the two sides stood facing east and west
 kauravon kii taraf se bhishma or pandavon kii taraf se arjuna sena kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe the
 Only the armies of both sides were standing in the circle of the area of only 5 plan of Kurukshetra
 yuddh se purv arjuna shrikrishna se apane rath donon senaaon ke madhya main le jane ko kehete hai jisase vah yah dekh le ki yuddh main use kin kin yoddhaon kaa saamana karnaa he
 When Arjun sees his Guru Drona, Pitamah Bhishma and other relatives in the battle field, he becomes very sad and sad
 vah shrikrishna se kahata he ki jinke liye ham ye saare rajbhog praapt karnaa chaahate hai, ve to yahan is yuddh kshetra main usee rajbhog kii prapti ke liye hamaare vipaksh me khadey hai inhen markar ham raaj praapt karke bhi kya karegein
 Therefore, i will not fight, saying that Arjuna sits on the back of the chariot with his bow, then Sri Krishna is situated in yoga and gives him knowledge of the Gita and says that what has come in the world will have to go one day or the other
 yah sharir or sansar donon nashwar hai parantu is sharir ke andar rahane vaala aatma sharir ke marane par bhi nahin marataa
 Just as a person renounces old clothes and wears new clothes, similarly, the soul also abandons the old body and takes on a new body
 Think of it as if all this nature is getting you done, you are just an instrument
 shrikrishna arjuna ko gyaan yoga,bhakthi yoga or karm yoga teenon kii shiksha dete hai jise sunakar arjuna yuddh ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he
 According to the Mahabharata and other mythological texts, this war led to the decline of Vedic knowledge and many other great dynasties along with the descendants of India
 mahabharat main varnit is yuddh ke kuch mukhya parinaam nimna likhit hai- Negative fruit sakaaratmak fal Based on the list of ancient dynasties given in Hindu traditions and Puranas and the astrological calculations given in other Vedic texts, the ancient Indian dynasty after Mahabharata period is the following in the historical chronology

 Shriram raised the bow and disbanded it
 is tarah sita kaa vivaah shriramji se nishchay hua
 With this, Urmila was married to Lakshmana, Mandvi to Bharata and Shrutakirti to Shatrughna
 kanyadan ke samay raja janak ne shriramji se kaha "he kaushalyanandan ram! ye meri putree sita he
 Accept it as your wife
 yah sadaa tumhaare saath rahegi
 "in this way the marriage of Sita and Ramji was very grand
 vivahoparaant sita ayodhya ai or unka daanpaty jivan sukhmay tha
 Due to the promise given by King Dasaratha to his wife Kaikeyi, Shriramji went into exile for fourteen years
 shriramji va anya badon kii salaah na maanakar apane pati se kaha "mere pita ke vachan ke anusaar mujhe aap ke saath hi rahanaa hoga
 i love you with all the happiness of this palace
 " is prakaar ram va lakshmana ke saath vanvaas chali gayi
 He took his exile on the Mandakini coast in Chitrakoot mountain
 isi samay bharat apane bade bhai shriramji ko manaakar ayodhya le jane aaye
 In the end, he returned with Shriramji's paduka
 iske baad ve sabhi rishi atri ke ashram gayi
 Sita worshiped the goddess Anasuya
 devi anusuya ne sita ko pativrata dharm kaa vistaarpurvak upadesh ke saath chandan, vastra, aabhushanadi pradaan kiya
 After this, many sages and sages went to the ashram, after getting darshan and blessings, they lived in Panchvati on the holy river Godavari coast
 panchvati main lakshmana se apamaanit shurpanakha ne apane bhai ravan se apni vyathaa sunai or uske kaan bharte kaha "sita atyant sundar he or vah tumhaari patni banane ke sarvatha yogya he
 "ravana together with his maternal uncle Marich hatched a plan to kidnap Sita
 iske anusaar marich sone ke hiran kaa rup dhar ram va lakshmana ko van main le jaayegaa or unki anupasthiti main ravan sita kaa apharan karegaa
 After abduction, Ravana cut his wings when Birdsraj Jatayu stopped while going through the sky route
 jab koi sahaayta nahin mili to sitaaji ne apane pallu se ek bhaag nikaalkar usamen apane aabhushanon ko baandhakar neeche daal diya
 Below, some monkeys took it with them
 ravan ne sita ko lankanagari ke ashokavatika main rakhaa or trijata ke netritv main kuch rakshasiyon ko uski dekh-rekh kaa bhaar diya
 After being separated from Sitaji, Ramji became sad and along with Laxman reached Jatayu searching for him
 jataayu ne unhen sitaaji ko ravan dakshin disha kii ore liye jane kii soochna dekar praan tyaag diya
 Rama Jatayu was cremated and walked in the south direction along with Lakshmana
 aage chalate ve donon hanumanji se mili jo unhen rishyamook parvat par sthit apane raja sugriv se milaayaa
 After friendship with Ramji, Sugriva sent troops of monkeys around in search of Sitaji
 vanar rajkumaar angad kii netritv main dakshin kii ore gai tukdi main hanuman, nil, jamavant pramukh the or ve dakshin sthit sagar tat pahunche
 On the way, he found Jattayu's brother Sampathi who informed him that Sita is in a garden in Lanka
 hanumanji samudr laanghakar lanka pahunche, lankini ko parrast kar nagar main pravesh kiya
 There, he was deeply saddened at not finding Sita Mata in all the buildings and in Antipur
 apane prabhu shriramji ko samaran va naman kar ashokavatika pahunche
 There, like a 'spark of smoke', Sitaji recognized and was delighted to see a fiery form among the demons
 usee samay ravan vahaan pahunchaa or sita se vivaah kaa prastaav kiya
 Sita placed a piece of grass between her and Ravana and said "O Ravana! Like Sun and Kiran, rama-sita is integral
 ram va lakshmana kii anupasthiti me meraa apharan kar tumne apni kaayarta kaa parichay or rakshas jati ke vinaash ko aamantran diya he
 Being unaware of the valor of the Raghuvanshis, you have made such an audacity
 tumhaare shriramji kii sharan main janaa is vinaash se bachane kaa ek maatr upaay he
 Otherwise the destruction of Lanka is certain
 " isse niraash ravan ne ram ko lanka aakar sita ko mukt karne ko do maah kii avadhi di
 After this, the marriage of Ravana and Sita is decided
 ravan ke lautne par sitaaji bahut du:khee hui
 The Trijata demoness endorsed his dream that Shriram would conquer Ravana and free him
 uske jane ke baad hanuman sitaaji ke darshan kar apane lanka aane kaa kaaran bataate hai
 Sitaji contemplates the skill of Rama and Lakshmana
 shriramji kii mudrika dekar hanuman kehete hai ki ve mata sita ko apane saath shriramji ke paas liye chalate hai
 Sitaji explains to Hanuman that this is unfair
 ravan ne unka haran kar raghukul kaa apmaan kiya he
 Therefore, it is the duty of Shriram to free him from Lanka
 visheshtah ravan ke do maah kii avadhi kaa shriramji ko samaran karaane kii vinati karti hai
 Hanumanji warns Ravana of the consequences of his audacity and burns Lanka
 mata sita se chudamani va apni yatra kii anumati liye chale
 Angad and Vanarasena at Sagartat reached Shriramji

 After this, all the Vanarasena including Ram and Laxman got ready for war
 hindu dharm main ekadshi kaa vrath mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he
 Every year there are 24 Ekadashis
 jab adhikmas yaa malmaas aata he tab inaki sankhya badhkar 26 ho jaati he
 The Ekadashi of Shukla Paksha of Jyeshtha month is called Nirjala Ekadashi, drinking of water is forbidden in this fast, hence this is called Nirjala Ekadashi
 jab sarvajna vedavyas ne pandavon ko chaaron purusharth- dharm, arth, kaam or moksh dene vaale ekadshi vrath kaa sankalp karaayaa to mahabali bhim ne nivedan kiya- pitamah! aapane to prati paksh ek din ke upwas kii baat kahi he
 i cannot live without food for even a single day - i have to eat many times as many people as i can to keep the calm called 'vrak' in my stomach
 to kya apni us bhukh ke kaaran main ekadshi jaise punyavrat se vanchit rah jaaounga? Pitamah, while diagnosing Bhima's problem and boosting his morale, said- No Kuntinandan, this is the specialty of religion that it does not hold everyone, the means of fasting also provide a very easy and flexible system of fasting rules
 atah aap jyeshtha maas kii shukla paksh kii nirjala naam kii ek hi ekadshi kaa vrath karo or tumhen varsh kii samast ekadashiyon kaa fal praapt hoga
 Of course, you will get salvation, gain happiness, fame and attainment in this world
 itane aashwaasan par to vrikodar bhimsen bhi is ekadshi kaa vidhivat vrath karne ko sahamat ho gaye
 Therefore, this superior Nirjala Ekadashi, which gives the virtuous benefit of the year-long Ekadashi, is also called Pandava Ekadashi or Bhimseni Ekadashi in the world
 is din jo swayan nirjal rahakar brahman yaa jaruratmand vyakti ko shuddh pani se bharaa gadaa is mantra ke saath daan karata he
 Once Maharishi Vyas visited Pandavas here
 bhim ne maharishi vyas se kaha, bhagwaan! yudhishthar, arjuna, nakul, sahadev, mata kunti or draupadi sabhi ekadshi kaa vrath karte he or mujhase bhi vrath rakhane ko kehete he parantu main bina khaae rah nahi saktaa he isliye choubees ekadashio par nirahaar rahane kaa ksht sadhana se bachaakar mujhe koi aisa vrath bataaiye jise karne main mujhe vishesh asuvidha na ho or sabakaa fal bhi mujhe mil jaye
 Maharishi Vyas knew that there is a fire called Briq in the stomach of Bhima, so his hunger does not calm down on eating a large amount
 is vrath me snaan aachman me pani pine se dosha nahi hota he is vrath se anya taees ekadashio ke punya kaa laabh bhi milegaa tum jivan paryant is vrath kaa paalan karo bhim ne bade saahas ke saath nirjala ekadshi vrath kiya, jiske parinaam swaroop praatah hote hote vah sagyaheen ho gaya tab pandavo ne gagaajal, tulsi charnamrita prasad, dekar unki murcha dur kii
 Hence it is also called Bhimsen Ekadashi
 yah vrath par nar nari dono ko karnaa chahie
 On this day, worshiping Lord Vishnu in Sheshashi form while performing waterless fast has special significance
 is din namo bhagavate vasudevy kaa jap karke godaan, vastra daan, chhatra, fal aadi kaa daan karnaa chaahie

 How many such people were born in India and went away
