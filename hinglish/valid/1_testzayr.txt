vigyaan bhikshu ke purv pravachanon se spasht he ki ve sankhya shaastra ko vedanusaari maanate hai
 He is clear that he supports the meaning of the Vedic verses "ekvidiyyah", etc
 through Sad tips and arguments, rendering and deliberating it makes it understandable
 vigyanbhikshu ne vastut: lok main prachlit purv parampara kaa hi anusaran karte hue apana purvokt mat prakat kiya he
 Since the very ancient times, in the Mahabharata, Gita, Ramayana, Smriti and Puranas, not only is there a mention of the Sankhya as a high knowledge, but there is also a detailed description of its principles
 gita main bhi sankhya darshan ke trigunatmak siddhant ko badi sundar reeti se apanaaya gaya he
 "trigunatmika Prakriti is the continual resultant
 uske teenon gun hi sadaa kuch na kuch parinaam utpann karte rahete hai, purush akarta he" -sankhya kaa yah siddhant gita ke nishkaam karmyog kaa aavashyak ang ban gaya he 
 Similarly elsewhere, many theories of Samkhya philosophy are visible in the ancient Sanskrit Vadmay, complementing the principles of other philosophies
 in sab baton se aisa prathit hota he ki yah darshan apane mul main vaidic hi rahaa he, avaidic nahin, kyonki yadi satya isse vipareet hota to vedapraan is desh main sankhya ke itane adhik prachaar-prasar ke liye uparyukt kshetra na miltaa
 Vedanta commentator Shankaracharya, who refuted it as Vedah due to the so-called Vedas against the principles of Atheism, Prakriti dualism, consequentialism, etc
, also had to write in the commentary of Brahmasutra 2
1
3 that "even after having many spiritual memories, the Sankhya Yoga memories only Attempt was made in disposal
 kyonki ye donon lok main param purusharth ke saadhan rup main prasiddh hai, shisht mahapurushon dwaara gruhit hai tathaa "tatkaarann sankhya yogabhishanna gyatva devam muchyate sarvapashai: yaa ityadi shrot lingon se yukt hai
 "it is also clear from the evidence of the commentator himself that even during the time of his predecessor Sutrakara, many elegant men considered Sankhya philosophy as Vedic philosophy and followed it as a means of ultimate effort
 in sab tathyon ke aadhaar par sankhya darshan ko mulat: vaidic hi maananaa samichin he
 Yes, in its later development it must have gone against the Vedas in some fundamental principles like the latter is nirvishvara against the Sankhya Vedic tradition, its nature independently creates the entire world
 parantu is darshan kaa mul pracheenatam chhandogya evam vrihadaaranyak upanishdon main praapt hota he
 Its antiquity is evident from this
 is darshan ke do hi moulik granth aaj uplabdh hai- pehla chah adhyyon vaala "sankhya-pravachan-sutara" or doosraa sattar karikaon vaala "sankhyakarika"
 Apart from these two, there is also a very small sutra script which is famous as "tattva Samas"
 shesh samast sankhya vadmay inhen teenon kii tikaa or upatika maatr he
 Among them, Kapil is considered to be from the Upadesha tradition of Sankhya Sutras
 kai kaarnon se uplabdh sankhya-pravachan-sutron ko vidwaan log kapilkrit nahin maanate
 It is definitely certain that even considering these sources as Kapilopotip, many of its sites will have to be projected on the strength of the inter-target of the sources themselves
 sankhyakarikas, ishwarkrishna dwaara rachit hai, jinka samay bahumat se i
 tritiy shatabdi kaa madhya mana jaataa he
 In fact, their time seems to be long before this
 kapil ke shishy asuri kaa koi granth nahin bataaya jaataa, parantu inke prathit shishy acharya panchasikh ke naam se anek sutron ke vyasakrut yogabhashya aadi pracheen granthon main uddhrut hone se spasht prathit hota he ki inke dwaara rachit koi sutaragranth ati pracheen kaal main prasiddh tha
 By the opinion of many scholars, this famous book was Shashistantra
 udaiveer shastri ke mat se vartmaan kaal main uplabdh shadadhyaai sankhya-pravachan-sutara hi shashthi padaarthon kaa nirupan karne ke kaaran "shashthitantr" ke naam se bhi gyaat tha
 By his opinion, probably Panch Shikhacharya of Kapil Muni had written an explanation on it and that too was called Shashtantra in the name of the original text
 kuch vidwaanon ke mat se "shashthi tantra" prasiddh sankhyacharya varshganya kaa likhaa hua he
 Today there is no special knowledge about many other ancient figures like Jagishdhya, Deval, Asit etc
 tsar yaa zaar rus or kai anya slav samskritiyon main samraat yaa raja ke liye shabd he
 The queens and nobles are called Tsarina or Zarina
 roosi samrajya main bhi maharaja ko 'tsar' kii oopaadhi se hi janaa jaataa tha
 It originated from the Latin word 'caesar'
 varhadi, marathi kii ek upbhasha he
 It is spoken in most parts of Vidarbha
 saanchaa:hindu philosophymanvanwara, manu, hindu dharm anusaar, maanavtaa ke prajnak, kii aayu hoti he
 This time is the astronomical period of measurement
 manvantar ek sanskat shabd he, jiskaa sandhi-viched karne par = manu+antar miltaa he
 It means the age of Manu
 prayek manvantar ek vishesh manu dwaara rachit evam shasit hota he, jinhen brahma dwaara sajit kiya jaataa he
 Manu originates the world and all beings, which are built and keep going till the time of his age
 After the death of Manu, Brahma again creates a new Manu, which again creates all the creation
 iske saath saath vishnu bhi aavashyaktaa anusaar, samay samay par avatar lekar isaki sanrachana or paalan karte hai
 Along with this, a new Indra and Saptarshi are also appointed
 chaudaa manu or unke manvantar ko milakar ek kalp banataa he
 It is a day of Brahma
 yah hindu samay chakra or vaidic samayrekha ke nausar hota he
 At the end of every kalpa, a catastrophe occurs, in which the cosmos destroys and comes to a state of rest, which is called the night of Brahma
 iske uparaant srishtikarta brahma fir se sristirachana armbh karte hai, jiske baad fir sanhaarkarta bhagwaan shiv iskaa sanhaar karte hai
 And all this happens in an endless process or cycle

 In 1971, Ratan Tata was appointed director-in-charge of National Radio and Electronics Company Limited, a company in dire financial straits
 ratan ne suzav diya ki company ko upabhokta electronics ke bajaay ucch-praudyogiki utpaadon ke vikaas main nivesh karnaa chahie jearady nelco ke aitihaasik vittiya pradarshan kii vajah se anicchhuk the, kyon ki isane pehle kabhi niyamit rup se labhaansh kaa bhugtan nahin kiya tha

 phir bhi, jearady ne ratan ke suzav kaa anusaran kiya

 jal ke saath kriya ke falswaroop prati gram sandra amla 205 calories ushm kaa utpaadan karata he
 Concentrated acid draws water from organic materials, wood and animal tissues, which results in the decomposition of organic materials and the cuckoo as a residue
 gandhakaml lavan banaata he, jise salphet kehete hai
 Sulfates are common or neutral salts, such as normal sodium sulfate or acidic sodium bisulfate
 amleey isliye ki isamen ab bhi ek hydrogen rahata he, jo ksharakon se pratisthapit ho saktaa he
 Sulphates are formed by the action of acids on metals, metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates or other salts
 adhikansh sulphate jalaviley hote hai
 Only calcium, barium, strontium, and sis salts are insoluble or very soluble in water
 anek lavan audyogic mahatv ke hai
 Barium and sis sulfate are used as pigments, sodium sulfate is used in paper manufacture, copper sulfate as a pesticide, and calcium sulfate as a plaster of Paris
 sis or ispaat par sandra amla kii koi kriya nahin hoti
 Therefore, Sis and steel vessels are used in the manufacture of acids and for keeping acids
 prayogshaalaon main nimnaankit teen ritiyon se alp maatra main gandhakaml taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he : By dissolving sulfur trixide in water, hydrogen paroxide tathaa sulfur dioxide kii sidhi kriya se- By the slow oxidation of a solution of sulfuric acid in the air
 audyogic str par sis-kaksh-vidhi tathaa sansparsh vidhi se amla kaa utpaadan hota he
 In the contact method, sulfur dioxide is first formed by the combustion of sulfur, such as sulfur or iron sulfide, and is converted into sulfur dioxide by the oxygenation of air in the presence of a platinum metallic asbestos catalyst, which dissolves in water to form sulfur
 is vidhi main jal kii upasthiti main nitric amla dwaara sulfur dioxide ke oxikaran se amla banataa he
 This action takes place in large Sis chambers, hence its name is 'sis-chamber-method'
 is vidhi kaa upyog baari maatra main salphuric amla banane ke liye hota tha, kintu isaki kuch kamiyaan hai jiske kaaran ab iskaa sthaan sansparsh prakram ne le liya he
 The first factory to manufacture Gandhakamal on a large scale was established in 1740 AD in Richmond near London by a scientist named Ward
 nirmaan ke liye gandhak tathaa shore ke mishran ko lohe ke paatr main garam kiya jaataa tha or amla ke vaashp ko kaanch ke paatro main jinamein jal bharaa rahata tha, ekatra kiya jaataa tha
 The dilute acid obtained in this way was concentrated in glass containers above the sand boiler
 kuch samay pashchaat sheeghra tuutanevaale kaanch ke paatro ke sthaan par chah foot chaude sis kakshon kaa prayog hone laga
 In 1810, the use of modern seashell method started by the hard work of a scientist named Holker
 1818 i
 se gandhak dwizarkik kii prapti ke liye kachche maal gandhak ke sthaan par pirietiess naamak khanij kaa prayog hone laga
 The Sise-chamber method was modernized by the development of the gay-lupac Pillar in 1827 AD and the Globar Pillar in 1859 AD
 yahan nitrogen ke oxide, gandhak dwizarkik tathaa vaayu ko kaksh main pravesh karaayaa jaataa he
 Such a gas mixture is injected into the 25-foot-high Glover column from below
 is stambh main upar se ge-lusac stambh kaa gandhakaml tathaa nitrosil gandhakaml kaa mishran tapakataa he
 The gas mixture enters the sis chamber after exiting the column
 saadharantaya sis kaksh teen rahete hai
 Here steam also enters the chamber
 gas mishran or bhaap ke bich kriya hokar, gandhakaml banakar, kaksh ke pende main ikattha hota he
 The residual gases now enter the gay-lussac column
 inamen pradhanthya nitrogen ke oxide rahete hai
 The gay-lussac column is filled with pieces of coke or stone
 usamen upar se gandhakaml tapakataa he or rukaawat ke kaaran dhire-dhire girakar, nitrogen ke oxidon ko avashoshit kar, nitrosil gandhakaml banataa he or glover stambh main prayukt hota he
 In this way, the loss of nitrogen oxides is saved
 sis kaksh se praapt amla ashuddh hota he
 The impurities contain arsonic, nitrogen oxides and some salts
 aisa amla pradhanthya urvarak ke nirmaan main prayukt hota he
 Pure acid is not necessary for this
 aisa amla sasta hota he
 Another method of manufacturing sulfur acid is the contact method
 is vidhi se praapt amla adhik shuddh or sandra hota he
 It was developed by a scientist named Nitz in 1889–90 AD
 germany kii badishche anilin and soda fabric company ne is vidhi se sarvapratham amla taiyaar kiya, at: ise badishche vidhi, athwa badishche prakram bhi kehete hai
 Most of the world's sulfuricides are manufactured nowadays by contact method
 isse kisi bhi sandran kaa amla praapt ho saktaa he
 In this method, sulfur is obtained by burning sulfur, or by acquiring pyrites
 ise vaayu ke saath milakar utprerak par le laayaa jaataa he, jahaan gandhak dwizarkik vaayu ke oxigen se sanyukt hokar gandhak trioxide banataa he
 "oleum" is obtained by absorbing sulfur trioxide into the concentrated sulfur
 olium kii jal ke saath kriya se vaanchit sandratha ke amla ko praapt kiya jaataa he
 First microdivided platinum was used as a catalyst
 yah bahut mahanga padataa tha
 When vanadium pentoxide is used in place of platinum, it is much cheaper than platinum
 utprerak kii kriyasheeltaa kam na ho jaae, iske liye aavashyak he ki sulfur dioxide arsenic, raakh tathaa dhul kanon se bilkul mukt ho
 Hence, the sulfur is arranged for filtering the bifurcation and it is passed through such substances in which arsenic is completely released
 yadi gas ko shuddh na kar liya jaae, to utprerak kii kaaryashiltaa jald nasht ho sakati he
 The gases that enter the catalytic chamber contain sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen
 urdhwadhar paatro main utprerak rakhaa rahata he
 The gas released there is absorbed into the concentrated sulfuric acid
 isse olium praapt hota he
 Up to 40 percent more sulfur in the oleum can be absorbed in addition to 100 per cent of sulfur
 aavashyak maatra main pani daalkar, isse vaanchit sandratha kaa amla praapt kar sakate hai
 Several acid manufacturing plants have been made by contact method, which can give more pure and less expensive acid

 The most prominent fruit of the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms is the three-dimensional isomerism
 samaavyavi ve yogic hai jinka anusutra ek samaan hota he, par kuch bhautik tathaa rasinic gunon main ve bhinn hote hai
 This variation is due to the variation of the arrangement of atoms within their molecules
 ethil alkohaul or diemethil ether donon kaa anusutra ek hi C2H6O he, par anuon main parmaanuon kaa vinyas bhinn bhinn he
 There are two types of configurational isomerism: one is optical isomerism and the other is geometric isomerism
 prakaashiya samavyawata asamamit hone ke kaaran prakaashat: sakriy hote hai tathaa bahut se rasinic or bhautik gunon main samaan hote hai
 Their most prominent difference is the action with polarized light, because the rotation of these isomers can be equal and counterclockwise
 jyamitiya samaavyaviyon ke rasinic tathaa bhautik gunon main bhinnata hoti he
 The actual study of the early history of the Vinayasarasayana begins with the discovery of some phenomena of light
 1908 i
 main malus ne ghurnan dwaara prakaash ke dhruvan kii khoj kii or teen varsh baad arago ne sphatik ke prakaash-sakriy hone kaa pataa lagaaya
 In 1815, Vio discovered that solids as well as liquids and gases are photosynthetic in a solution
 vishisht ghurnan - kisi prakaashat: sakriy padaarth kaa vishisht ghurnan sameekaran ke dwaara darshaya jaataa he, jise vishisht ghurnan, prakaash kii tarang lambaai l tathaa t degree taap ke liye he or a prakaash ke ghurnan kaa ansh he, jo 1 centi meter lambii nalee se hokar prakaash ke jane se praapt hua tathaa d nalee main bhari hui prakashaskriy vastu kii prati ghan senmi
 sandratha he
 Rightward rotation is called positive and leftward rotation is called negative
 vishisht ghurnan prakaash tarang, lambaai, taap, vilaayak tathaa sandran par nirbhar he
 Sometimes the direction of rotation becomes opposite due to their change
 shele ne 1768 i
 main tarterik amla angooron ke tarter se praapt kiya tathaa 1819 i
 main cestner ne usee sanghatan kaa ek amla upjaat ke rup main paaya or iskaa naam racemic amla rakhaa
 In 1838, Biao discovered that tartaric acid is optically active, and racemic acid is lightly inactive
 dhruvit prakaash tathaa prakaashat: sakriyata kii khoj ke uparaant vinyasarsayan ke siddhanton main ullekhneey pragati paister ke dwaara hui
 Paster discovered that the composition of tartaric and racemic acids and their structure is HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-COOH, but their physical properties differ
 racemic amla, tarterik amla kii apeksha pani main kam viley he tathaa tarterik amla or uske lavan prakaashat: sakriy hai, par racemic amla or uske lavan prakaashat: niskriy hai
 Paster's most famous discovery was on sodium and ammonium salts of racemic acid
 yah lavan jab jal se 22 degree par crystalikrut hota he, to iske cristan duusare recemet se bhinn hote hai or inaki ardhafalakeey falikaay hoti hai
 Two types of crystals are obtained, one is southward like sodium ammonium tartrate and the other is crystals whose opposite properties are opposite
 is duusare prakaar ke crystal ko darpan pratibimb kii sangya di gai
 When they were separated from the mixture, its aqueous solution was counterclockwise
 isse praapt amla kaa crystal bhi tarterik amla ke crystal ke darpan pratibimb ke rup main tha or vilyan bhi vamavart tha
 Therefore, this acid was considered as another form of tartaric acid
 inke crystal asamamit hote hai : It was found that only those crystals and molecules, whose mirror images are not imputed, are lightly activated
 aisi sanrachana ko asamamit kehete hai
 Many substances are lightly activated only in solid state, such as crystalline, sodium chlorate, etc
 sarvapratham gyaat, prakaashat: sakriy padaarth sphatik hi he, jiske crystal do prakaar ke, ek dakshinvart or doosraa vamavart, hote hai
 These two crystals are mirror reflections of each other and do not impose
 crystal ke aise jodon ko pratibimb rup kehete hai
 Its activation disappears when the crystal is smelted
 isliye sphatik kii prakaashat: sakriyata uske asamamit crystal sanrachana ke kaaran hoti he
 Substances of this class remain lightly active only as long as they are in solid form and their activity is destroyed by melting, evaporation and in solution
 bahut se yogic thos, galan, gasiy yaa vilyan avasthaa main bhi prakaashat: sakriy hote hai, jaise glucose, tarterik amla aadi
 Their activation is due to the unmatched molecular structure of the compound
 is anu or uske darpan pratibimb ko pratibimb rup, prakaashiya prativinyasi yaa prakaashiya samaavyavi kehete hai
 Except for only two things, these forms result from one of the physical properties
 ek hi dhruvit prakaash ke saath baraabar or vipareet ghurnan dete hai or duusare dakshinavart tathaa vamavart vrittiya dhruvit prakaash ke saath inkaa avasorana gunank bhinn hota he
 The chemical properties of reflection forms are the same, but there is often a difference in the reaction with another optically active substance
 sharirkriyaatmak sakriyata main bhi antar ho saktaa he, jaise histydin meetha hota he or histydin swadaheen; nicotine nicotine se adhik vishaiylla hota he
 In 1874, Vant Hoff and Le Bal resolved the existence of the apparently isomerism of organic compounds
 waant half ne vichaar kiya ki carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaa kisi samachatushfalak ke chaaron siron kii taraf nirdeshit he or carbon parmaanu us chatushfalak ke madhya main sthit he
 According to this theory, the four hydrogen atoms of methane will be the same, which has also been proved by physical and chemical reactions
 iske purv 1858 i
 main yah samajha jaataa tha ki carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaayen ek samtal main hai or carbon parmaanu is varg ke centre par he
 The four valencies of carbon in the CX4 molecule are the same and it is conceivable that they have a symmetric configuration in the stereoscope
 is prakaar teen vyavastha sambhav ho sakati he - taleey, piramidia or chatushfalkeey
 If the molecule is unilateral, three forms of the compound c abde may be possible
 yadi anu piramidy he, to is yogic ke chah rup sambhav ho sakate hai
 If the molecule is tetrahedral, only two forms of compound c abde will be possible and both will be mirror reflections of each other
 vastav main yogic c a b d e ek jode pratibimb rup main hi praapt hote hai, jo chatushfalkeey anusanrachana kii pushti karte hai
 When all four groups in carbon are different, then such carbon is called asymmetric carbon
 prakaashat: sakriy carbonic yogicon main ek, athwa ek se adhik, asamamit carbon parmaanu avashya rahete hai
 When both the c abde forms of the asymmetric carbon compound change to Ca2 bd, only one optically inactive substance is obtained, such that both the lactic acid clockwise and counterclockwise give the same propionic acid
 isse chatushfalkeey carbon kii pushti hoti he
 Crystalline analysis of the Runtgen ray, dipole base, absorption spectrum and electron diffraction studies also confirm the tetrahedral nature of carbon
 ganitiya gananaa ke dwaara carbon kii kisi do sanyojaktaa ke bich kaa kone 109 degree 28minute nikaala gaya
 It was previously thought that this valence angle is constant, but it is now known that valence may deviate from its location and this angle can also change
 jab carbon parmaanu se sanyojit sabhi chaaron parmaanu yaa samooh ek se hote hai, to yah kone nishchay hi 109 degree 28 minute hota he, jaisaa methen, CH4, yaa carbon tetracloride, ccl4, main he
 But in methylene chloride CH2 Cl2, the angle is found to be 112 degrees, because greater dispersion in the valence angle is possible due to the repulsive force of large atoms of chlorine
 ek asamamit carbon parmanuwale samaavyaviyon main mukhya antar unki prakaashiya sakriyata main he
 The only difference is in the sign of rotation of both reflection forms
 isliye inhen prakaashat: prativinyasi bhi kehete hai
 The molecule of lactic acid, CH3
CHOH
COOH, has only two optically active isomers, which are mirror mirrors of each other
 inhen dectro - or livo - lactic amla kehete hai
 In equal proportions, the mixture of the two forms is lightly inert, because the rotation of the two reflection forms is the same and the direction is opposite
 aise anu anupaati mishran, jo bahyat: pratikaarit tathaa prakaashat: niskriy hote hai, racemic roopaantar kehalaate hai
 Such racemic compounds are directed by r or dl-prefixes
 is prakaar ek asamamit carbon parmaanu vaala yogic teen roopon main praapt ho saktaa he
 The probability of these isomers is dependent on the asymmetric carbon atom
 carbon kii asamamitati nasht hone par prakaashiya sakriyata tathaa samavyawata donon lupt ho jaati hai
 Decomposition of both forms of activated malic acid gives inactive succinic acid, HOOC
CH2
CH2
COOH
 yogicon main jyon-jyon asamamit carbon parmaanuon kii sankhya badhati jaati he tyon-tyon adhik samaavyavi roopon kii sambhaavna badhati jaati he
 In the normal case of an asymmetric compound consisting of the number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the number of optically active isomers can be 2n and 2n-1 will be pairs of reflection forms f, ie 2n racemic forms
 ve yogic, jinamein do bhinn asamamit carbon parmaanu hon 2 x 2 arthath chaar roopon kii kshamta rakhte hai
 These will have two pairs and each pair will have the same and opposite sign rotations
 donon jodon se do racemic rup bhi praapt honge
 Examples of this type are the cinematic acid dibromide, C6H5
 CH Br
 chbr
 COOH is obtainable in four optically active forms and two racemic forms
 yogic, jinamein donon samaan asamamit carbon parmaanu hon, teen vinyason main paae jate hai, jinamein do prakaashat: sakriy pratibimb rup hote hai or teesraa ant:pratikaarit niskriy hota he or inkaa vibhedan prakaashat: sakriy roopon main nahin ho saktaa
 Apart from these, a racemic form also arises from both active forms
 sankhya 3
 dwaara nideshit padaarth prakaashat: niskriy hota he
 Although it has two active carbons, they neutralize each other, as their rotation is the same and opposite
 is ant:pratikaarit anu ko i athwa meso rup kehete hai
 Inactive and undifferentiated forms are not possible in compounds that have the same asymmetric carbon atom
 yah racemic roopon se bhinn hota he, jinka vibhedan unke prakaashat: sakriy roopon main kiya ja saktaa he
 The best example of this type is dihydroxycinic acid, which has two identical asymmetric carbons and which historically has great value
 siddhant ke anusaar yah dakshinvart, vamavart or meso-tartirik amla roopon ke samaan mishran se praapt hota he
 The southward and counterclockwise are optically transient and the meso and racemic are passive
 inke sanrachanasutra nimna rup se darshaae ja sakate hai : An equivalent mixture of a pair of models is called a racemic form
 yah rup nimna kaarnon se praapt ho saktaa he : By mixing both models in equal amounts
 asamamit yogicon ke sanshleshan main racemic rup praapt hota he
 The process of converting a lightly active compound into a racemic form is called respiration
 praaia: yogicon ke + or - roopon kaa rapeemikaran taap, prakaash or rasinic abhikarmakon ke prabhaav se ho saktaa he
 The action of transformation depends on the compound and the reagents
 kuch yogicon kaa rapeemikaran itani saralata or shighrata se hota he ki unako prakaashat: sakriy rup main nahin praapt kiya ja saktaa
 There are some compounds that are not mixed
 vibhedan yah kriya he jisase racemic roopantaran se uske donon pratibimb rup alag kiye jate hai
 In fact, their quantitative separation is very rare and in some there is only one model
 vibhedan kii kuch vidhiyaan is prakaar hai : Mechanical separation - Paster discovered the method by which the crystals of both models are different and can be separated by hand
 paister ne sodium ammonium tarteret ko 28 degree sein
 par crystalikrut kar, donon prakaar ke crystalon ko chimate se alag alag kiya tha
 The use of this method is very limited
 niveshan dwaara varnatmak crystalan - racemic mishran ke atisantrupt vilyan main jab ek pratibimb rup kaa ek crystal daalaa jaataa he, to pehle usee pratibimb rup kaa crystal hota he or is prakaar us rup kaa pruthakkaran ho saktaa he
 Biochemical resolution - When some bacteria or mold grow on a dilute solution of a racemic, they destroy one image form more quickly than the other
 is prakaar kisi nirdisht samay ke uparaant ek pratibimb rup kii prapti ho sakati he
 Penicillium glaucum, when grown on a solution of racemic ammonium tartrate, destroys the first dextro form and the levo survives
 rasinic vibhedan - yah vidhi sabase uttam he
 In this, the reflection forms of the racemic compound are treated with a lightly active compound, so that they combine together to form compounds that can be easily separated
 racemic amlon ko prakaashat: sakriy ksharak ke saath upachaarit karne se jo lavan banenge, unamem kuch lavan +amla tathaa +ksharak ke honge or kuch lavan - amla tathaa +ksharak ke honge
 Their properties may vary, from which they can be separated by crystallization
 varanatmak avasorana - prakaashat: sakriy padaarthon kaa varanatmak avasorana kisi vishesh prakaashat: sakriy avasorak dwaara ho saktaa he
 Many chemists have done the differentiation by this
 pehle dakshinavart or vamavart pratibimb roopon ko kramash: dactro or livo upsargon se nirdeshit kiya jaataa tha
 Similarly, it was called factory tartaric and levo tartaric acid
 waantahof ne + or - chinhon kaa prayog asamamit carbon ke vinyas ko darshane ke liye kiya he
 Fisher later proposed that the prefixes d and l be used for their configuration position and not to be used for the direction of rotation
 kisi prakaashat: sakriy padaarth ke ghurnan kaa chinh praaia: praayogic dasha main parivartan se vipareet ho saktaa he or isi bhaanti unke sanjaton kaa, jinka vinyas usee prakaar he, chinh bhi ghurnan kii disha se vipareet ho saktaa he, jaise vamavart lactic amla ke lavan or aster dakshinavart hote hai or dakshinavart lactic amla ke vamavart
 For all these reasons, it was considered that for lightly active matter such a mark should be used which directly indicates the position of the configuration and this mark is independent of its mark of rotation direction
 glissraldihide, jisamen ek asamamit carbon parmaanu he, do pratibimb roopon main prapya he or ek swaichh nishchay ke anusaar dakshinavart rup ko aise darshaate hai ki hydraxil, -OH, samooh kaa carbon daahine or hydrogen parmaanu vaain taraf hota he
 According to the arrangement of tetrahedral carbon, the hydrogen and hydroxyl groups are above the surface of the surface and the -CHO and -CH2OH groups are below the surface of the surface
 glissraldihide ke is vinyas ko d kehete hai
 According to popular practice, the group connected by a horizontal line is above the surface of the page
 is bhanti iske pratibimb kii dasha kaa sanket hai
 The configurations related to the authentic configuration of this D-glyceraldehyde fall under the D-class, ie compounds that can be derived from D-glyceraldehyde, or can be converted to D-glyceraldehyde by chemical reaction, into the D-range
 Come
 is tarah glissraldihide kaa puraa naam d glissraldihide or l glissraldihide hota he
 And indicate its rotation direction
 inke eldihide samooh ko agle sajaateey - CHOH - CHO main badla ja saktaa he or jaise ki isamen ek asamamit carbon he vaise hi har glissraldyhide do rup denge
 In carbon compounds, when one group is replaced by another group, it is understood that the substituent replaces the removed group
 yadi ek prakaashat: sakriy yogic a saadhaaran pratisthaapan abhikriya se ba yogic main parivartit hota he, to inke vinyas ek se hote hai
 This is true, but sometimes the configuration changes as well as replacement
 is vinyas parivartan ko prakashkeey pratilomon, yaa avishkaarak wolden ke naam se walden pratilomon kehete hai
 a simple example of this is the substitution of chlorine in chloroxynic acid from the hydroxyl group, malic acid is obtained and southward acid is obtained using potassium hydroxide

 Ruchika was a promising tennis player

 haryana lon tennis association ke pramukh ke rup main, rathod ne ruchika ke liye vishesh prashikshan praapt karne kaa vaada kiya
 He said Ruchika this

 un donon ko dekhakar, rathore apane kamare main tennis coach kol karne ke liye aradhana poocha
 aradhana chhod diya or rathore akele ruchika ke saath tha
 He immediately grabbed her hands and waist and pressed her body against his
 Ruchika tried to push him away, but he continued molesting her
 lekin aradhana laute or kya chal rahaa tha dekha
 use dekhakar, rathore ruchika jari kii he or apni kursi main waapas gir gaya
 After this, he asked to go out of his room and personally pray to bring the coach with him
 He refuses, when Rathore asks him to bring the coach, loudly rebukes Aradhana
 He insisted that Ruchika come into his room, but he managed to run out
 ruchika hua ki aradhana sab kuch bataa diya
 donon ladakiyon ko pehali baar main kisi ko nahin bataaya
 agle din, ve tennis khilne ke liye janaa nahin tha
 The next day, 14 August they changed practice time to avoid Rathore and played till 6:30 pm
 haalanki, ve ja rahe the, gend kudaal, Patloo, rathod ne apane karyaalay ke liye unhen phone kiya tha unhen bataaya
 yah ladakiyon ko is ghatana ke bare main apane mata pita bataane kaa faisla kiya he ki is baat par tha
 After this, Panchkula residents, parents of most of the tennis players, Anand Prakash, Ruchika's friend Aradhana's father gathered at the residence and some stern action should be taken by way of bringing the matter up with higher authorities decided
 ve yaa to mukhyamantri Hukum singh yaa grih mantri sanpat singh se sampark karen, lekin 17 agast 1990 par, grih mantri ke saath is maamle par charchaa kii or jaanch karne ke liye police mahanideshak ram rakshpal singh ne kaha jo, grih sachiv jeke duggal se mulaakaat nahin kar sake
 Rathore has allegedly paid some residents of Rajiv Colony in Panchkula and also the support of the people of his community in Narayangarh, Ambala district

 On 3 September 1990, Rathore was convicted in the investigation report submitted by RR Singh to Home Secretary JK Duggal
 It recommended an FIR be filed immediately against Rathore
 Duggal has failed to forward the Chief Minister for necessary action which sent the report to Home Minister Sampat Singh
 The home secretary who followed Duggal never followed up on the report
 report main yah bhi ek purv vidhayak, jagajeet singh tikka ruchika ke ghar ke saamne naare or uske parivaar ko pareshaan karne ke liye logon ke ek bade samooh kaa aayojan kiya he

 However, the government's legal advisor, RK Nehru, suggested in 1992 that an FIR be lodged requesting that the state government was not competent to issue the charge sheet
 Then, Chief Minister Bhajan Lal's office sent the case to the Chief Secretary for advice
 Ultimately, no action was taken
 rathore ne sabhi rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon se samarthan kaa anand le rahaa tha or sambhav sajaa se bachane ke liye pranali main apane prabhaav or bachaav ke raaston kaa upyog kar rahaa tha
 On 20 September 1990, two weeks after the investigation convicted Rathore, she was expelled from Sacred Heart School, a school for girls, in Ruchika Sector 26, Chandigarh
 ruchika kaksha main vahaan se adhyayan kiya tha The school is actively plotting against Ruchika

 The school had in fact refused to accept her fees
 vidhyalay kii saamaanya prakriya he ke rup main koi notice, fees kaa bhugtan na hone ke liye ruchika ko diya gaya tha
 The school's brochure states that payment of fees can neither lead to not being allowed to take the exam
 yah nishkasana ke liye aadhaar nahin he
 a magisterial inquiry found 135 similar cases of non-payment of fees to the Sacred Heart, but Ruchika was found to have been a student ever expelled on these grounds
 1990 main vilamb shulk ke 17 maamalon main se kam se kam 8 chaatr baad main ruchika kii tulana main unki fees kaa bhugtan kiya, lekin koi karrwai nahin kii unke khilaaf liya gaya tha

 yah ruchika uske sahpaathee tha jo rathore kii beti Priyanjali, sharmnaak se bachane ke liye nishkasit kar diya gaya tha ki aarope lagaaya gaya he
 The magistrate tried to stall the investigation into the dismissal of the school Ruchika
 Sister Sebastina appeared before the inquiry only five days later
 If they continued to stall the investigation, the authorities of Chandigarh threatened the school with legal action
 uske nishkasana ke baad, ruchika khud ko ghar ke andar hi simit he

 All written values are in sections of an absolute unit standard
 The Greek root of stadios means to stand or have standing, to establish a standard
 In Mesopotamia the problem was that there were several different standards so in the time of Gudea an agreement was circulated between the various city states much like that which is presently being negotiated in Europe
 The weights and measures of Mesopotamia gradually developed with the associated city states
 The Sumerian number system uses a base 60 positional notation, and is the origin for the division of 60 for hours and angular degrees
 The Akkadian system adopts the Sumerian
 Over a period of several millennia international trade and commerce spread the idea of standards of measure based on definitions of land and property throughout the ancient near east
 International trade required the expansion of the arrangement throughout the ancient Near East as a common standard much like our metric system
 The basis of the standard was a definition of a geographic degree divided into 600 parts know as stadia which were further divided into 600 feet

 Through films such as Broken Blossom, Way Down East and Orphans of the Storm, Griffith set new records of success
 lekin ye filmein apane mahangi laagat or prachaar ke kaaran vyavsaayik rup se safal nahin raheen
 Despite this, Griffith produced nearly 500 films in his lifetime

 Meanwhile, he also tried his hand at writing scripts for plays

 saath hi griphith ne 1908 main choti filmon kaa nirmaan bhi shuru kar diya or 6 saal baad unki pehali feechar film “jeudith of bethulia” pradarshit hui
 However, a few years earlier, Griffith had also met Edwin Porter, a producer at Edison Studios in New York, who was looking for a place as a playwright
 porter ne unki patakatha ko nakaar dene ke baavjood unhen apni film “rescude from en eagles nest” main bhoomika di
 That's where Griffith's cinematic career began

 griphith ne us saal company ke liye 48 choti filmon kaa nirmaan or nirdesan kiya
 Griffith's short film, made in 1910, was the first film shot in Hollywood
 chaar saal baad unhone apni pehali feechar film judith of bethulia kaa nirmaan kiya
 The film is one of the earliest full length feature films made in the US
 haalanki is film ke nirmaan ke samay nirmaataa company biograph kaa maananaa tha ki itani lambii filmein vyavsaayik rup se safal nahin hongi
 According to actress Lillian Gies, the company's idea was that such a long film would prove to be tiring of the audience
 apane lakshya kaa prapti main avrodh or film nirmaan main oonchi laagat par company ke virodh ke chalate griphith ne biograph ko chhod diya
 He joined Mutual Film Corporation with his fellow cast members
 unhone magestic studio ke manager harry atkin ke saath milakar reliance-magestic studio naam se apana khud kaa studio shuru kar diya
 The studio was later renamed Fine Art Studio
 reliance-magestic studio ke jariye griphith ne ‘da clansmen’ naam kii film kaa nirmaan kiya jise baad main ‘da berth of nesan’ naam se janaa gaya
 The film is considered to be the first full length film in the history of cinema

 The Black American People's Organization strongly opposed the performance of this film and was also successful in banning the film in many cities
 lekin baavjood iske ye film apane samay kii sabase safal or charchit film sabit hui
 The film is rated as the first "block Buster" film in the history of cinema
 is film ke bare main yahaan tak kaha jaataa he ki is film ne box aphis par itani kamai kii ki iske nirmaataa is kamai kaa record tak nahin rakh paae

 Through his next film Intervention, Griffith tried hard to answer the charge of apartheid
 lekin ye film vyavsaayik rup se safal nahin ho pai
 Though the film did well at the box office, the cost of the film was so high that it was impossible to recover it
 is film ne griffith kii aarthik rup se behad nuksaan pahunchaaya
 After which the reliance-majestic alliance broke down and Griffith then started working with film production companies like 'paramount' and 'first National'
 inhen dinon unhone charlie chaplin ke saath milakar ‘united artist’ naam kii nai company shuru kii
 Under the banner of this company, Griffith continued to pursue filmmaking but did not get the success he had in life from the film The Birth of a Nation

 His films made under the banner of the company performed well at the box office but these films were not successful in making profits
 united artists ke liye banaai griphith kii filmon main brokene blashems, ve dian east, ormons of di storm, dream street, van exciting nite or america shaamil hai
 The first three of these films were commercial successes, resulting in Griffith being forced to leave United Artists following the failure of Easy Life Wonderful
 united artists se alag hone ke griphith ko jivan kii dushwariyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In 1936, 12 years after leaving the company, film director 'woody Van Dyke', who was an apprentice in his film 'interlerance', asked him for help in filming the famous earthquake scene in his film 'san Francisco' but despite the help, the film's credits Did not give them any space
 baad ke dinon main griffith haalanki film nirmaan se alag ho chuke the phir bhi apane daur main unhen takneekee rup se sabase daksh filmkaar mana jaataa rahaa he
 Even though he did not get offers to make films independently, many filmmakers tried to get technical advice from him
 1939 main griffith ko nirmaataa ‘herald yugen ruukh’ ne apni filmon main griffith se sahyog maanga lekin griffith to apane dhun ke pakke the
 He was not even reconciled with the ideas of this producer and he dropped out of the project
 griffith ne haalanki film ke credit se apana naam hataane kii apil lekin nirmaataa ne film main bataur nirmaataa unke naam kaa upyog kar liya
 In the last phase of life, people forgot Griffith
 gumnami main jite hue griffith kabhi kabhaar filmon ke set par pahunch jate the
 Seeing him, his old colleagues would become so aware that the shooting of the film came to a standstill
 aise main griphith kisi aad main chhupakar shooting dekha karte the

 , Filmmaker Orson Welles even went so far as to say that he never had so much hatred for the film industry about Hollywood's behavior, "no business in the world would be as indebted to any person as this one The entire film world
 “ Multidimensional images can be etched on the screen through the camera, which only Griffith could understand initially
 drishy ke chhayankan or sampadan ke jariye unhone cinema kii ek prabhaavapurn bhashaa or shilpkaaree kaa sarvatha anoothaa prayog kiya
 For the first time in his films, the camera's placement, the angle of the cinematography and the planned use of lighting in the scene enhanced the depth of the emotions of the characters

 vartmaan samay main uttar pradesh ke mathura nagar sahit vah bhu-bhaag, jo shrikrishna ke janm or unki vividh lilaon se sambadhit he, braj kehalaata he
 Thus, Braj is an additional name for the present Mathura Mandal and the ancient Shursen region and its shortened form
 isamen mathura, vrindavan, govardhan, gokul, mahaban, valdev, nandagaanv, varasanaa, deeg or kambon aadi bhagwaan shrikrishna ke sabhi lila-sthal sammilit hai
 The range of the said Braj has been considered as eighty-four Kos
 surdaas tathaa anya vrajabhasha ke bhakt kaviyon or vaartakaron ne bhagwat puraana ke anukaran par mathura ke nikatavarti vanya pradesh kii gop-basti ko braj kaha he or use sarvatra 'mathura', 'madhupuri' yaa 'madhuban' se pruthak vatalaya he
 The major cities in the Braj region are Mathura, Jalesar, Bharatpur, Agra, Hathras, Dhaulpur, Aligarh, Etawah, Mainpuri, Etah, Kasganj, and Firozabad
 braj shabd sanskrit dhaatu 'vraj' se bana he, jiskaa arth gatishiltaa se he
 The place where cows graze and roam is also called Braj
 amarkosh ke lekhak ne braj ke teen arth prastut kiye hai- goshth, maarg or vrund 
 The word Braj in Hindi is derived from the word Vraj in Sanskrit
 vaidic samhitaon tathaa ramayana, mahabharat aadi sanskrit ke pracheen dharmagranthon main braj shabd goshaala, go-sthaan, gochar bhoomi ke arthon main bhi prayukt hua he
 In the Rigveda, the word is described as a gaushala or a khirak of cows
 yajurveda main gaayon ke charne ke sthaan ko braj or goshaala ko goshth kaha gaya he
 Braj is indicated by the location of the beautiful horned cows in the Shuklayajurveda
 atharvaveda main goshlaon se sambadhit puraa sookt hi prastut he
 In Harivamsa and Bhagavatpuranas, this word is used as Gop Basta
 skandapurana main maharishi shanndilya ne braj shabd kaa arth vthapit vatalate hue ise vyapak brahm kaa rup kaha he
 Therefore, this word is related to the spirituality of Braj
 vedon se lekar puraanon tak main braj kaa sambadh gaayon se varnit kiya gaya he
 Whether it is a farm to tie cows, whether it is cowshed, whether it is a land of land and whether it is a cottage
 bhagwatkaar kii drushti main goshth, gokul or braj samanarthak hai
 Braj has been used in the same sense in the compositions of Surdas based on the Bhagavata
 mathura or uskaa nikatavarti bhu-bhaag pracheen kaal se hi apane saghan wanon, vistrut charaagahon, goshton or sundar gaayon ke liye prasiddh rahaa he
 Although Lord Krishna was born in the city of Mathura, he was sent to the gop-slavery across the Yamuna as soon as he was born due to political reasons
 was
 us kaal main unke paalak nandadi gop gana apni suraksha or gochar-bhoomi kii suvidha ke liye apane gokul ke saath mathura nikatavarti vistrut van-khandon main ghumaa karte the
 Due to Shri Krishna, the importance of those cow-gopis, cows and trans-lands was increased
 puranic kaal se lekar vaishnav sampradaayon ke aavirbhaav kaal tak jaise-jaise krishnopasna kaa vistaar hota gaya, vaise-vaise shrikrishna ke ukt parikron tathaa unke lila sthalon ke gaurav kii bhi vruddhi hoti gai
 There was an abundance of cow rearing here during this period, due to which Vrajkhandas also became abundant
 isaliye shri krishna ke janm sthaan mathura or unki lilaon se samvadhit mathura ke aas-paas kaa samast pradesh hi braj athwa brajamandal kaha jane laga tha
 In this way the meaning of the word Braj has evolved in chronological order
 vedon or ramayana-mahabharat ke kaal main jahaan iskaa prayog 'goshth'-'go-sthaan' jaise laghu sthal ke liye hota tha
 In the mythological period, some big places like 'gop-basti' started to be done
 us samay tak yah shabd pradeshvai na hokar kshetravayi hi tha
 In the Bhagavata, 'braj' is used in the regional sense only
 vahaan ise ek chote gram kii sangya di gai he
 In it, 'village' smaller than 'pur' and smaller settlement than that is called 'braj'
 16veen shatabdi main 'braj' pradeshvai hokar 'brajamandal' ho gaya or tav uskaa aakaar 84 kos kaa mana jane laga tha
 At that time Mathura city was not considered to be included in 'braj'
 surdaas tathaa anya braj-bhashaa kaviyon ne 'braj' or mathura kaa pruthak rup main hi kathan kiya he, jaise pahile ankit kiya ja chukaa he
 The size of Braj also expanded when the area of braj culture and Brajbhasha expanded due to Krishna worshipers and Brajbhasha poets
 us samay mathura nagar hi nahin, balki usase dur-dur ke bhu-bhaag, jo braj samskruti or braj-bhashaa se prabhavit the, vraj antargat maan liye gayi the
 Present kaal main mathura nagar sahit mathura jile kaa adhikansh bhaag tathaa rajasthan ke deeg or kambon kaa kuch bhaag, jahaan se brajayatra guzarati he, braj kaha jaataa he
 The area of braj culture and Braj language is even more extensive
 ukt samast bhu-bhaag re pracheen naam, madhuban, shurasen, madhura, madhupuri, mathura or mathuramandal the tathaa aadhunik naam braj yaa brajamandal hai
 Although there is a difference in their meanings and sizes from time to time
 is bhu-bhaag kii dharmik, rajnatik, aitihaasik or samskruthik parampara atyant gauravpurn rahi he
