 He was the elder brother of Sugriva
 vah kiskindha kaa raja tha tathaa indra kaa putr bataaya jaataa he
 Rama, the incarnation of Vishnu, killed him
 haalaanki ramayana kii pustak kiskindhakand ke 67 adhyyon main se adhyay 5 se lekar 26 tak hi wali kaa varnan kiya gaya he, phir bhi ramayana main wali kii ek mukhya bhoomika rahi he, visheshkar uske vadh ko lekar
 An interesting episode exists about the birth of Vali
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki wali indra or arun kaa putr tha
 Indra was the king of the gods and Arun the charioteer of Suryadev
 aisi manyata he ki surya rose saat safed ghodon ke rath main subah aate hai jiskaa sanchaalan arun karata he
 Once upon a time, some sage cursed the sun that he would not be luminous on the earth
 kyonki surya ne iske pashchaat rath kii sawari band kar di atah arun ke paas koi kaam nahin rahaa
 Arun had already wished to go to heaven and see the divine dance of the Apsaras
 usne is avasar kaa laabh uthaakar ek yuvati kaa vesh dhaaran kiya or apsaraon kaa nrity dekhne swarg lok pahunch gaya
 Indra, who was enjoying this dance, saw a young woman like Arun and was fascinated by it
 donon ne samagam kiya or kalantar main arun ne wali ko janm diya
 Wali was raised by Ahilya, wife of Gautam Rishi
 vanar raaj wali Vali was married to Tara, daughter of the monkey Vaidyaraja Sushen
 ek katha ke anusaar samudr manthan ke dauraan chaudaa maniyon main se ek apsaraayen thim
 One of those nymphs was Tara
 wali or sushen donon manthan main devatagan kii madad kar rahe the
 When they saw Tara, both of them vied to make her a wife
 wali tara ke dahini taraf tathaa sushen uske baayin taraf khadey ho gayi
 Then Vishnu decided that at the time of marriage, the girl is her husband on the right side and the father who gives the bride on the left side
 atah wali tara kaa pati tathaa sushen uskaa pita ghoshit kiye gayi
 It is said that Vali received a gold necklace from his father Indra, who was blessed by Brahma with a mantra that by wearing it, whenever he faces his enemy in the battlefield, half of his enemy's power will be depleted and Vali Will be received
 is kaaran se wali lagbhag ajey tha
 There is such an incident in Ramayana that once Vali was going to Sandhyavandan, Narada Muni was going from the sky
 wali ne unka abhivadan kiya to naarad ne bataaya ki vah lanka ja rahe hai jahaan lankapati ravan ne devraj indra ko parrast karne ke upalaksh main bhoj kaa aayojan kiya he
 Narada of a fickle nature - who is omniscient - tried to pinch Vali and said that now only Ravana is the supreme being in the entire universe and all beings, even the gods, give him the title
 wali ne kaha ki ravan ne apane vardaan or apni sena kaa istemaal unako dabaane main kiya he jo nirbal hai lekin main unamem se nahin hoon or aap yah baat ravan ko spasht kar den
 The omniscient Narada told the same thing to Ravana, who got angry on hearing Ravana
 usne apni sena taiyaar karne ke aadesh de daale
 Narada also took a pinch from him that if you take the entire army for a monkey, it will not be appropriate for your honor
 ravan turant maan gaya or apane puspak vimaan main baithkar wali ke paas pahunch gaya
 At that time, Vali was doing evening
 wali kii swarnamayi kanti dekhakar ravan ghabara gaya or wali ke peeche se waar karne kii cheshtaa kii
 Vali was engrossed in his worship of Archana, but still he held him by his tail and pressed his head beside him and roamed the whole world
 usne aisa isliye kiya ki sampurna vishwa ke praani ravan ko is asahaay avasthaa main dekhen or unke man se uskaa bhay nikal jaye
 After this, Ravana accepted his defeat and extended the hand of friendship towards Vali, which Vali accepted
 maaya naamak asur stri ke do putr the — mayavi tathaa dundubhi
 Dundubhi was an Asura as Mahish
 pahaad se mahaan dundubhi ko apane bal par itnaa dambh ho gaya ki usne sagar raaj ko dwandv yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 Though Sagar Raj could finish his arrogance there, but he said that with such a hero he is unable to duel and asked Dundubhi to go to Himwan, the king of the Giris
 dundubhi himavan ke paas gaya to himavan ne bhi usase yuddh karne ke liye manaa kar diya tathaa usase indra ke putr wali ko lalkaarane kaa suzav diya jo ki kiskindha kaa raja tha
 Dundubhi then went to the door of Kishkindha and challenged Vali to a duel
 madamast wali ne pehle to dambhi dundubhi ko samajhane kii koshish kii parantu jab vah nahin mana to wali dwandv ke liye raji ho gaya or dundubhi ko badi saralata se haraakar uskaa vadh kar diya
 After this, Vali bounced off Dundubhi's lifeless body and threw away a plan in one stroke
 sharir se tapakati rakt kii boonden maharishi matang ke ashram main giriin jo ki rishyamook parvat main sthit tha
 The enraged Matang cursed the Vali that if the Vali ever came within the scope of a plan of his Ashram, he would die
 ramayana ke kiskindha kand main yah bhi ullekh aata he ke wali pratidin surya ko jal chadhaane purv tat se pashchim tat or uttar se dakshin taton main jaataa tha
 He used to throw the peaks of the mountains that came in the way and catch them again as if it were a ball
 iske pashchaat bhi jab vah surya vandana karke lautataa tha to use thakaavat nahin hoti thi
 It is said about Vali that if anyone challenged him for a duel, he would be ready immediately
 dundubhi ke bada bhai mayavi kii wali se kisi stri ko lekar badi puraani shatruta thi
 Mayavi came to Kishkindha one night and challenged Vali to a duel
 striyon tathaa shubhachintakon ke manaa karne ke baavjood wali us asur ke peeche bhaaga
 Sugriva was also with him
 bhaagate-bhaagate mayavi zamin ke neeche bani ek kandara main ghus gaya
 Vali also followed him
 jane se pehle usne sugriv ko yah aadesh diya ki jab tak vah mayavi kaa vadh kar lautakar nahin aata, tab tak sugriv us kandara ke muhane par khadaa hokar paharaa de
 After a gap of more than a year, blood came out from the mouth of the cane
 sugriv ne asur kii chitkaar to suni parantu wali kii nahin
 Realizing that his forehead was killed in the battle, Sugriva closed the mouth of that candra with a rock and returned to Kishkindha where he told the news to everyone
 mantriyon ne salaah kar sugriv kaa rajbhishek kar diya
 After some time, Vali appeared and was very angry when he saw his brother-in-law
 sugriv ne use samajhane kaa bharsak praytn kiya parantu wali ne uski ek na suni or sugriv ke rajya tathaa patni rumaa ko hadapkar use desh-nikaala de diya
 Due to fear, Sugriva took refuge in Mount Rishimuk where Vali could not go due to the curse
 yaheen sugriv kaa milaap hanuman ke kaaran ram se hua
 On Rama's assurance that Rama would kill the Vali himself, Sugriva challenged the Vali
 wali lalkaar sunakar baahar aayaa
 There was a fierce battle between the two, but because both brothers had the same face and body composition, Rama did not shoot his arrow due to confusion
 antat wali ne sugriv ko buree tarah parrast karke dur khaded diya
 Frustrated, Sugreev again came to Rama
 ram ne is baar lakshmana se sugriv ke gale main maala pehanaane ko kaha jisase vah dwandv ke dauraan sugriv ko pahchaanane main galati nahin karenge or sugriv se wali ko pun: lalkaarane ko kaha
 Desperate Sugriva again walked towards Kishkindha's gate to dare Vali
 jab wali ne dobaaraa sugriv kii lalkaar suni to uske krodh kaa thikaana na rahaa
 Tara might have realized that Sugriva enjoys the protection of Rama because Sugriva alone does not dare to dare to fight again
 atah kisi anhoni ke bhay se tara ne wali ko saavdhaan karne kii cheshtaa kii
 He even said that after declaring Sugriva as the crown prince of Kishkindha, he should make a treaty with him
 kintu wali ne is shaq se ki tara sugriv kaa anuchit paksh le rahi he, use dutkaar diya
 But he assured Tara that he would not kill Sugriva and would only teach him a good lesson
 donon bhaaiyon main phir se dwandv shuru hua lekin is baar ram ko donon bhaaiyon ko pahchaanane main koi galati nahin huyi or unhone wali par ped kii oot se baan chalaa diya
 The arrow pierced Vali's heart and he fell down to the ground
 dharti par gire maranasann wali ne ram se kai prashn kiye jinka saar is prakaar he:- In the Ramayana, Valmiki has tried to answer these questions as much as possible, but in the absence of any concrete answer, those who commented on the Ramayana have tried to justify the episode in their own way
 ramayana ke bangla roopantaran krittivasi ramayana ke anusaar tara ram ko yah shaap detii he ki agle janm main ram wali ke haathon isi prakaar maare jaayenge kyonki shaayad is ramayana ke rachayita ko yah puraa prakaran hi tarkahin laga ho or is tarah is prakaran kaa samaadhaan kiya ho
 It is mentioned in the Mahanataka and the Ananda Ramayana that in the next life, Vali as the predator kills Krishna - who is the next incarnation of Vishnu - in the illusion of hunting

 During this time, Wallace enlisted the help of Young Robert the Bruce, the son of the leper Noble Robert the Bruce and the main contender for the Scottish crown
 However, Robert is dominated by his conspiratorial father who, despite his son's growing dominance towards Wallace and his movement, wants to bow to the British and secure the throne of Scotland for his son

 sankhyatmak vishleshan main newton vidhi kisi vaastavik maan vaale falan ke mul nikaalane kii ek punraritimulak vidhi he jiske dwaara mul ke sannikat maan se armbh karke kramshah adhik yatharth mul praapt kiya jaataa he
 It is also called the 'newton-rapson method'
 ek char vaale falnon ke liye is vidhi kaa varnan is prakaar he: Suppose the function ƒ and its derivative ƒ ′, for the real x, is given
 falan f kaa mul nikaalane ke liye sabase pehle mul kaa pratham anumaan x0 lekar yah vidhi shuru hotihai
 Now x1 is derived from the following formula to give a more accurate value of the original: isi prakriya ko baar-baar doharaaya jaataa he jab tak mul kaa paryaapt rup se yatharth maan na praapt ho jaay
 This method can be understood geometrically by the following moving diagram: newton kii vidhi atyant shaktishaalee takanic he
 Its convergence is quadratic
 kintu is vidhi kii kuch samasyaayen bhi hai- This example has been resorted to to understand the working of this method
 mana sameekaran cos ⁡ = x 3 { \ displaystyle \ cos=x^{3}} kaa ek dhanatmak mul nikaalnaa he
 Now let's change the form of this equation as follows: chunki x ke sabhi maanon ke liye cos ⁡ ⩽ 1 { \ displaystyle \ cos \ leqslant 1} tathaa x>1 ke liye x3>1 atah is sameekaran kaa mul 0 or 1 ke bich hoga
 Let the original x 0 = 0, 5 { \ displaystyle x_ {0} = 0,5}
 is mul ke pratham 7 ank vaastavik mul ke pratham 7 ankon ke baraabar hai
 If no more than this is required, then by taking the same value of the original one can finish the calculation

 vah badi bechaini se sinthia ke ghar lautne tak intjaar karata he or phir vah un prem patron ko uske saamne rakhata he, magar sinthia ke kuch bhi bayaan se pehle vah baahar chalaa jaataa he
 Rustom extracts a pistol from the naval ship's arsenal and calls Delhi a trunk
 iske baad, vah vikram se milane uske daphtar ho aata he, phir uske ghar ko nikalataa he
 While Rustom enters directly into Vikram's bedroom, his servant hears three gunshots and runs towards the room, only to find Vikram's corpse lying in the blood on the pool and Rustom in his hands
 The pistol goes on holding

 ghabaraai hui sinthia jail main band rustam se milti he, magar tab bhi vah usase koi baat nahin karata
 Eventually Rustom meets him and hears Cynthia's interrogation, how Rustam was so sad and sad after Rustom's months moved to London
 jiske akelepan kaa phayda vikram ne uthaaya or sinthia ko apane mohpash main baandha,magar vikram kii hatya baad sinthia pehle hi tut chuki thi jab usne pehle hi shaadi karne se manaa kar diya tha

 urdu kavita ke liye sahitya academy puraskaar - 1969 Whom the government feeds, in which 99% of the public is harmed, we say that the general public should stay away from it, if anyone wants to lose money, then they should be welcome in the stock and commodity market
 It is more dangerous than alcohol, gambling etc
 If you are a gambler and an alcoholic, don't worry, if you are a gambler, then do not play anything
 If you want to lose weight, do not play with your children
 Die is definitely Play as-kinship Samprkwale stay away from close meet members is definitely Play ??? If you have not learned, then you have to play, then know this market, 1 city is a move of shares etc
 You should see the move 2 Always buy below, should sell above and do not play without selling goods
 Always take the price at 5% of the higher rate
 Suppose the price of a share goes up to Rs
 1000, then wait for it to come up to Rs
 50
 Should come Will come down in 1 year, will change in 3 years to 5 years; 95% will fall in 1 year
 When the election starts, the market starts changing after the elections
 In about 3 years and 10 months, the market will be the highest
 Everything will be expensive
 After that, the temple will start 4 months before the election
 You can buy there, after 4 months of formation of the government, the market will start to pick up gradually
 Mandi will start after about 4 years fast
 This futures market goes on like this
 This is the same land - Makano raw material also runs in the commodity-futures market, which will be back at 33% of the price, no matter how expensive it is from the time of election
 You should invest 10% of your deposit capital in this market
 Not much, do not consider this business, this is a speculative, how does this speculative work? i tell you, on the computer, you see buyers and sellers on both sides, they are mostly fake
 And you keep buying and selling amongst each other, you think in the market The fast is slowing down while it is waiting
 When you buy or sell, the people will run contrary to the work that they will do in abundance, that is, the public plays the main role in bringing speed
 Their effort is, according to them, wherever the public thinks, the victory should be the same
 Because the people are not the same, they are the only things of the same plate
 Go against the work being done in abundance in the market
 At the rate at which 50% of the purchase is made, only when the second purchase is made, double the goods, such as 1 share price 50 rupees = 50 rupees = 2 share prices 25 rupees = 50 rupees = 4 share prices 12 rupees 50 paise = 50 rupees = 8 share prices 6 rupees 25 paise = 50 rupees = 16 shares
 32 share price 1 rupee 60 paise = 50 rupees, in this way you have 63 shares for Rs 300, the price of Rs 50 is almost Rs 6, you will never be beaten
 Will eat as trumped | First to come down from the maximum price of Rs 2300 in gold Must purchase Like === Maximum Price = 16040 -2300 = 13740 First Purchase
 Price should be doubled for second purchase at price 13740-2300 = 11440
 Price should be taken for the third purchase at the price 11440-2300 = 9140
 The goods should be bought 8 times at the price 9140-2300 = 6840
 Price is 6840-2300 = 4540 to buy the fifth, the goods should be 16 times
 In the same way silver should be purchased at a difference of 3000 rupees
 The price of gold and silver is 30 years, 10 years will change, 20 years will remain below copper glass gin nickel etc
 The gait is 7 to 8 years old
 No matter how expensive it will be from the time of election, you will definitely come back at 33% price
 No one has the magic of magic, never work at the behest of anyone
 If you are not aware of this market, then you would not have earned it yourself
 Why tell all losers who are gamblers! i believe that less capital can never win from this futures market if satyagrah prakaash jha dwaara nirdeshit ek bollywood raajnneetik thriller film he

 Vasco da Gama was presumably born in 1460 or 1469 near the southwest coast of Signs, Portugal
 inkaa ghar nossa senhora das salas ke girijaghar ke nikat sthit tha
 The erstwhile Signs, now one of the few ports on the coast of Alentejo, then had a cluster of whitewashed, red-roofed fishermen's huts

 Estevao de Gama was married to Donna Isabel Soudre
 vasco da gamma ke parivaar kii aarambhik jaankaree adhik gyaat nahin he
 Portuguese historian Teixeira de Aragão states that Vasco da Gama was educated in the city of राvora, where he may have acquired knowledge of mathematics and navigation
 yah bhi gyaat he ki gamma ko khagolashastra kaa bhi gyaan tha, jo unhone sambhawatah khagolgy abraham zakuto se liya hoga
 In 1492, King John II of Portugal sent Gama south of the port of Setubal, Lisbon
 unhen vahaan se francisi jahaajon ko pakad kar laana tha
 Vasco completed this task with skill and readiness

 He told his father this
 jon kaa ek sevak abhi suta se muslim qaidiyon ke badale dhan lekar lautaa tha
 After the coming of Islam under the rule of the last seven hundred years, it would certainly have been a selective task if Suta was defeated by the Portuguese invasion
 suta naa sirf ek vyast pattan bazaar tha, balki us samay morocco, pichley 30 saalon se araajaktaa main fansaa tha
 After much disrespect and Queen Philippa's insistence, John prepared a plan of attack
 holend par akraman kii taiyaari ke mukhute lagaakar suta par akraman kar diya
 In July 1415, Ceuta was conquered
 henry, edward or peter teenon ne is yuddh main senaanee kaa kaam kiya
 But nothing was achieved financially - the Muslims started trading with Tanziers instead of Sutah, and the ports of Sayuta remained empty
 us samay europe main kai bhrantiyaan prachlit thi
 One of them was that in Africa, somewhere in the south, a gold river flows
 par vahaan pahunchne kaa matlab he sahaara marusthal main maujuud muslim arab or barbar sena ko haraana
 In Henry's view it was possible and necessary to do this - after all, seven hundred years ago North Africa was under Christian occupation
 usne apane pita se tengier par akraman kii yojana kaa anurodh kiya lekin jon ko aisa sambhav nahin laga
 Tangier was farther away and more secure

 As expected - he had to face defeat
 uske senapatiyon ne waapas nikalne kii keemat suta ko moraccan haathon main saunpane kii baat kii
 Henry did not approve of this - he kept his brother Ferdinand as a hostage

 Meanwhile, Usmani Turks gained control over Istanbul in May 1453

 Diego again traveled to Namibia in 1486, once again in search of his goal - just 800 kilometers north of the southern point of Africa
 lekin, lautate samay wo congou main prester jon ko dhundne niklaa or phir uskaa koi pataa nahin chalaa
 One of the misconceptions prevalent in Europe was that somewhere in the east, there lived a king named Prester John, who is a Christian and owns immense wealth
 purtagaaliyon ko bharosa tha ki ye raja bharat kaa raja he
 To find out, Portuguese King John sent two detectives on a landward journey to the east
 lekin jerusalem pahunchne ke baad unhen maaloom hua ki arabi siikhe bina aage badhanaa sambhav nahin he - ve laut gaye
 After this, in May 1487, Pero da Covilha and Afonso de Peva were sent on a secret journey
 ve misr main sikandriyaa or kahiraa pahunch gaye
 Pero Aden from them reached Calicut via Red Sea
 vyapaar or margon ko usne nirikshan kiya or kahiraa laut gaya
 There he met two Portuguese Jews who were sent by King John
 jaankariyon kaa aadan pradaan hua or kowilha dakshin kii ore ithiopia chalaa gaya
 He wanted to return from there, but seeing his world knowledge, King Alexander appointed his advisor and promised to send him to Portugal later
 lekin wo jaldi mar gaya or uske bete ne uski ye kaamana puri nahin kii
 Kovilha settled there
 san 1526 ke kisi portugali mishan ne baad main paaya ki kowilha ithiopia main tandoorust, safal or swasth avasthaa main tha - usne vahiin shaadi kar lee or 74 varsh kii aayu main mara
 In August of 1487, the Portuguese king sent a sailor named Bartolomeo Dias to travel to Africa
 wo pehla european navik tha jo dakshintam africa ke tat - uttamasha antareep - ke paar pahunchaa
 But returned after being defeated by a fierce storm
 lekin uske pashchim se purab kii taraf ja sakane se yah sabit ho gaya ki africa kaa dakshini konaa he or duniya yaheen khatm nahin ho jaati
 Meanwhile, King Manuel proposed the idea of a four-boat crew to India
 is dal kaa captain gamma ko chunaa gaya
 Many were astonished by this - because Gama did not experience any major maritime challenge other than the battles around
 lekin anushaasit or raja ke vishwast hone ke kaaran use niyukt kar liya gaya
 On 8 July 1497, four ships sailed from Lisbon and began their maiden voyage to India
 lagbhag 170 logon ke is bede ke anya mahatvapurn naamon main martim aphonso or farnaao martins kaa naam tha
 Afonso had lived in the Congo and knew African dialects, while Fernao was an imprisonment in Morocco due to his imprisonment
 das se baarah abhiyukt bhi is jahaji bede main raja dwaara rakhe gaye the jinako khataranaak sthalon par jaankaree or khoji kaamon ko puraa karne kaa kaam diya gaya tha
 As expected, there were no women aboard the ship
 chalane ke ek saptaah baad, 15 july ko wo kenneri tak pahunche or uske baad chhaae dhundh kii vajah se jahaaj alag ho gaye
 They were scheduled to meet in Cape Verde, but Paolo de Gama did not see any other ship there
 halanki berio or bhandaaran jahaaj kuch ghanto ke bheetar aa gaye
 Gamma's ship was not found for the next four days
 milane ke baad wo vahaan ek saptaah tak ruke or phir 3 agast ko ravaanaa hue
 In all the Portuguese voyages so far, sailors' ships had passed through the Nicach off the coast of Africa - also to Bartelomeo Dias
 lekin ek tufaani hawa, jo khule atlantic main bahati he navikon ko uttamasha antareep tak teji se dhakel detii he -aisa vasco da gamma ne sun rakhaa tha
 Instead of turning east, his own sailors were told to walk south in the open sea instead of walking in Africa
 kai dinon tak khule samudr main chalane or koi jameen yaa aashaa na dekhne ke baad 1 navambar wo jameen ke nikat aae
 It must have been some 150 kilometers before Uttamaha
 logon main khushi kii lahar daud gai
 After restoring the ship and seeing its maps, people rested
 jahaaj par maujuud vrittantkaar ne likhaa ki logon kii chamadi kaa rang bhura he, ve sil, whale yaa hiran kaa maance or vanaspati kii jadi khate he
 They wear leather garments and dogs always walk with them
 vahaan se wo 16 navambar ko chale
 The Bulkul coast line did not match the map of Bertlemeo Dias, but the bay continued to move and reached Uttamaasha Antip on 22 November
 vahaan par dias dwaara sthaneey logon ke saath hue jhadpon kii khabar unhen mil chuki thi, lekin unke saath bhi vahaan par jhadap ho gai
 After repairing the ships, he left from there on 7 December
 16 disambar ko wo us nadi ke muhane par pahunche jahaan se bartelomeu dias ke navikon ne use waapas jane par majaboor kiya tha
 He saw a cross installed by Dias there
 iske baad ke raaston par aaj tak koi nahin pahunchaa tha - isliye pehle se bane maanchitr bekaar ho gaye or unhen nayaa maanchitr bananaa padaa
 They moved north along the coast
 chunki vah christmas ke aasapaas kaa samay tha, da gamma ke karmidal ne ek tat kaa naam, jisase hokar ve guzar rahe the, "nataal" rakhaa
 It means "christmas" in Portuguese and the name of that place is still in use till date
 janvari tak ve log aaj ke mozambik tak pahunch gaye the, jo purvi africa kaa ek tateey kshetra he jisapar arab logon ne hind mahaasaagar ke vyapaar network ke ek bhaag ke rup main niyantran kar rakhaa tha
 They were chased by an angry mob who came to know that they are not Muslims and they proceeded to Kenya
 kenya ke mombasa main bhi uskaa virodh hua
 After arriving, he was told that there are many Christians living in the city of Mombasa
 jahaaj ko tat se dur rakhane ke baad kuch navik shahar ke daure par gaye jahaan unhen gore isaiyon se mulaakaat hui
 Later it was learned that after receiving news from Mozambique, the Sultan there had prepared a plan to trap him
 gamma vahaan se bhaag niklaa - par use bharat pahunchne ke liye dishaao ke jaankaar navikon yaa nideshkon kii zarurat thi
 He caught four people coming on a small boat
 ek buudhe musalmaan vyapaaree ne bataaya ki paas ke tat malindi main bhartiya navik rahete hai
 Vasco reached Malindi seeing no choice
 bharatiyon ko deshkar use laga ki ye isai he - krishna ke uccharan ko wo christ samaj rahe the
 In Malindi, The Gama hired an Indian guide, who led the Portuguese on the forward route and brought them to Calicut, Kerala, on 20 May 1498, which is located on the southwest coast of India
 vahaan ke raja ne unhen kalikat ke pattan par aane kaa nyauta diya lekin gamma ke raah main itani baadhaayen ain thim ki use laga ki ye bhi dushman hi honge
 But he met Vali to meet and then Zamorin welcomed Gamma to Calicut with music
 vahaan par raaj-darbar main aane se pehle use ek mandir mila jahaan andar main use ek devi kii murti mila
 The Portuguese felt that this was a statue of Mary and she was convinced that Zamorin was a Christian ruler
 wo murti shaayad mariammaa devi kii thi jise wo isamsih kii maan mariyam samaj rahe the
 The comedian who was included in the group with Gamma who was welcomed by Jamorin wrote - "the people of this country are brown, short-sighted and at first look jealous and mean
 mard qamar ke upar kuch nahin pahante 
 Some have long hair, while many have shaved heads
 mahilaayein saamanyatya sundar nahin dikhti hai
 "fernão Martins translated Gamma into Arabic meeting Zamorin
 darbar main muslim salaahkaaron ne use vyapaar kii baat karne main kai adchane paidaa kii
 He ridiculed Gama's gift and delayed him to meet the king
 iske alaave uske paas raja ke liye uchit koi uphaar bhi nahin tha
 For this reason he had a fight with Zamorin
 zamorin ke muslim mantriyon ne usase vyapaar kaa kar maanga
 Zamorin also refuses to erect the pillar he had requested
 sulah or phir ladaai chalati rahi
 The king's Muslim ministers kidnapped many people from his entourage
 lekin samudr main unke jahaaj par aae graahakon ko gamma ne bandi bana liya
 Finally he was allowed to leave and in the end of August he left - the king also gave him a citation in Malayalam containing a message to King John of Portugal that Vasco had come here
 lekin agle hi din koi 70 arabi jahaaj vahaan akraman ke liye aate dikhe
 In response, he fired
 kuch bhartiya bandhakon ke saath sitambar 1498 main waapas portugal ke liye laut gaya
 He reached the Swahili coast again in January
 jahaaj par koi 500 din guzar gaye the - log thak or biimaar ho chale the
 While living some 2 weeks away from home on the West African coast, his brother - and captain of one of the crew's three ships, Paulo the Gamma - fell ill and was killed
 usne baaqi jahaajon ko lisbon laut jane kaa aadesh diya or bhai ko dafanaane ke baad apane dal se peeche lisbon pahunchaa
 He received a fierce reception there
 gamma ne waapas aakar apana vrittant raja manuel ko sunaaya
 Contrary to his prejudices, he found the Christians of India different and could not recognize Portugal - which surprised him
 bharat main muslimon kii upasthiti se bhi use duvidha hui
 Seeing the Muslim rule everywhere in Africa and the number of Muslim merchants in the Arabian Sea, he remembered his "christian duty" and sent two more missions within two years
 janvari 1500 isvi kaa samay bahut hi shubhankar laga, par mishan bhejne main 2 maheenon kii deree ho gai
 In March 1500, 13 ships headed by Pedro ारेlvarez Cabral sailed from Lisbon
 unka lakshya africa or bharat main vyapaar ke aadhaar lagane ke alaave jamorin ko muslim vyapaariyon ko bhaga dene kaa aagrah bhi tha
 But many ships were lost in order to go southwest and then east of Gamma's stated approach to reach Uttamaasha
 kaabral kalikat pahunchaa - nae jamorin ne europea jahaajon kaa vyapaar sweekaar kiya or suraksha kaa aashwaasan diya
 But Arab merchants had reached the port for that year
 kebral ne arab jahaaj ko pakad liya - ye kahkar ki ye jamorin ke saath hui vyapaar sandhi kaa ulanghan he
 In response, he killed all 70 people of the Portuguese factory
 lekin kaabral kii yatra purna asafalataa nahin thi - usne aate vaqt sophala or kilva ke raajaaon se sampark sthapit kiya
 He also went to Coonoor in India and some ships that were "lost" - reached South America
 isse pehle ke kabral laut paata, manuel pratham ne hoaao da nova ke netritv main 4 jahaajon ke saath niklaa
 a message left by Kabral was found hanging in an old shoe on the coast of Africa and reached Calicut
 vahaan pahunchakar usne kai muslim jahaajon par akraman kiya
 a factory in Coonoor returned to Lagar, Portugal
 is prakaar portugal ke jahaajon ne agle 20 saalon ke liye usne kalikat ke shaskaon se dushmani mol le lee
 In 1502, Vasco was repatriated
 uski agali yatra 1502 main hui, jab use ye gyaat hua kii kalikat ke logon ne peeche chhot gaye sabhi portugaliyon ko maar daalaa he
 He dismantled all the Indian and Arab ships en route to his voyage and proceeded to control Calicut and seized much wealth
 isse portugal kaa raja usase bahut prasann hua
 He also went to Cochin, Coonoor and Goa
 cochin ke dakshin main use sadiyon se rah rahe isaiyon kaa pataa chalaa
 Gama left some Portuguese there and the ruler of that city also asked him to leave everything he had left there, but he escaped from there
 uski duusari yatra portugali raja ke mishan ke hisaab se bahut safal rahaa kyonki usne arab vyapaariyon ke kadi ladaai kii - jamorin ko vyapaar ke liye majaboor kiya or bharat main rah rahe isaiyon kaa pataa lagaaya
 In 1524, he set out on his last visit to India
 us samay portugal kii bharat main upnivesh basti ke viceroy ke rup main aayaa, par vahaan pahunchne ke kuch samay baad uski mrityu ho gai
 Vasto de Gama was one of the most important ocean explorers after Portuguese prince and explorer Henry
 teen mahadeshon or do mahasaagaron ko paar karne ke baad bhi arab sagar main arab vyapaariyon or africa samrajyon se ladane or phir bharat aakar apane saath laae portugali raaj-sandesh tathaa uski hifaazat ke liye raja se yuddh or safalataa uske drudh-nishchay ko dikhaati he
 Vasco was rewarded as a successful soldier in Portugal upon his return
 apane samakaleen columbus ke mukaable uski lambi yatra main bhi baghaavat nahin hui or thakne ke baad bhi apane lakshya par jame rahaa
 The spice trade of Arab and Moore merchants was greatly hit when Vasco da Gama reached India
 is vyapaar ko hathiyaane ke liye vasco da gamma ne na sirf khatarnaak or parishramee yatra kii, balki kai yuddh bhi ladaa
 With the help of his superior guns, he was successful in most battles
 isse adan -hormuj -kalikat jal-vyapaar maarg tut yaa kamazor pad gaya
 Seeing his success, King Manuel of Portugal undertook many missions in India and the East
 albukark, jo uski tasri yatra se pehle portugal se bheja gaya tha, ne arab sagar main arabon ke vyapaar or saamudrik sena or sampatti ko tahas-nahas kar diya or khoji malaysia or phir china tak pahunch gaye
 By the sixteenth century, broken Arabic became the language of Portuguese trade instead of Arabic
 is samay portugal ek saamudrik shakti ban gaya
 Where he once reached in India is named vasco-di-gama in his honor
 chaand ke ek gadhde kaa or portugal main kai sadakon kaa naam vasco ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Originally made in 2011, he is portrayed as a villain in the Malayalam film Urumi, directed by Santosh Shivan

 In mathematics, complex numbers are extensions of real numbers
 kisi vaastavik sankhya main ek kaalpanik bhaag jod dene se samishra sankhya banati he
 i is associated with the imaginary part of a complex number that satisfies the following relation: kisi bhi samishra sankhya ko a + bi, ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he jisamen a or b dono hi vaastavik sankhyaayein hai
 In a + bi, a is called the real part and b is the imaginary part
 udhaaharan: 3 + 4i ek samishra sankhya he
 Representing a complex number as a + bi is called the Cartesian form of a complex number
 samishra sankhya z = x + iy ko dhruviya nirdeshaankon ke rup main bhi nirupit kar sakate hai
 Polar coordinates r = | z | ≥ 0, is called the absolute value or modulus of the complex number
 isi prakaar φ = arg ko z kaa konank kehete hai
 Angle φ = Angle can be obtained by adding 2π to that negative value if it is in the middle of the main value
 nimnlikhit rup dhruviya swaroop kehalaata he: It is also denoted by cis φ which is an abbreviated form of cos φ + i sin φ

 Which has a dimension and θ art
 dhyaan rahe ki electronic or vidyut abhiyantriki main i ke bajaay j kaa prayog kiya jaataa he kyonki i ke dwaara vidyut dhara kaa nirupan kiya jaataa he
 The absolute value of a complex number z = rei φ { \ displaystyle z = re ^ {i \ phi}} is defined as | z | = r { \ displaystyle | z | = r}
 Algebraically, if z = x + yi { \ displaystyle z = x + yi}, then | z | = x 2 + y 2
 { \ displaystyle | z | = { \ sqrt {x ^ {2} + y ^ {2}}}
} The absolute value has three important properties: for all complex numbers z and w
 These imply that | 1 | = 1 { \ displaystyle | 1 | = 1} and | z / w | = | z | / | w | { \ displaystyle | z / w | = | z | / | w |}
 By defining the distance function d = | z - w | { \ displaystyle d = | zw |}, we turn the set of complex numbers into a metric space and we can therefore talk about limits and continuity
 The complex conjugate of the complex number z = x + y i { \ displaystyle z=x+yi} is defined to be x − y i { \ displaystyle x-yi}, written as z ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ bar {z}}} or z ∗ { \ displaystyle z^{*} \ ,} 
 As seen in the figure, z ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ bar {z}}} is the "reflection" of z about the real axis, and so both z + z ̄ { \ displaystyle z+{ \ bar {z}}} and z ⋅ z ̄ { \ displaystyle z \ cdot { \ bar {z}}} are real numbers
 Many identities relate complex numbers and their conjugates: c + di ≠ 0 { \ displaystyle c + d \ , \ mathrm {i} \ neq 0} yoga: Subtract: guna: run: z = r e i φ { \ displaystyle z=re^{ \ mathrm {i} \ varphi }} kaa n { \ displaystyle n} vaan ghaat is prakaar nikaala jaataa he Or for the Cartesian form z = a + bi { \ displaystyle z = a + b \ mathrm {i}} kisi samishra aadhaar par samishra ghaataank ke liye saamaanya sutara he: Here ln ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ ln} will be assumed to be the principal of the complex quadratic
 yahan bahut saavdhaanee kii jarurat hoti he; dekhiye - The following formula is used to extract the n { \ displaystyle n} th root of the complex number z = rei φ { \ displaystyle z = re ^ { \ mathrm {i} \ phi}}: jahaan k { \ displaystyle k} kaa maan 0, 1, 


, n − 1 { \ displaystyle 0,1, \ ldots ,n-1} 
 Thus the total number of n { \ displaystyle n} th roots of a number is n { \ displaystyle n}
 samishra sankhya z = r e i φ { \ displaystyle z=re^{i \ phi }} ke prakritik laghuganak kaa mukhya maan hoga: The last formula is very useful for deriving the inverse of a complex number, if that number is given in Cartesian form
