 His army attacked Junnar city and looted 200 horses with a lot of wealth

 He sent a message through him that if Shivaji accepts the subjugation of Bijapur, the Sultan will give him the right to all the areas which are under Shivaji's control
 saath hi shivaji ko bijapur ke darbar main ek sammanit pad praapt hoga
 Though Shivaji's minister and advisor was in favor of As Sandhi, Shivaji did not like these talks
 unhone krishnaji bhaskar ko uchit sammaan dekar apane darbar main rakh liya or apane doot gopinath ko vastusthiti kaa jayja lene afjal khan ke paas bheja
 From Gopinath and Krishnaji Bhaskar, Shivaji felt that Afzal Khan wanted to imprison Shivaji by plotting a treaty
 atah unhone yuddh ke badale afjal khan ko ek bahumoolya uphaar bheja or is tarah afjal khan ko sandhi vaarta ke liye raji kiya

 At the same time, due to the revolt of Siddijauhar in Karnataka, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into an agreement with Shivaji
 is sandhi main shivaji ke pita shahji ne madhyasthata kaa kaam kiya
 According to this treaty in 1662, Shivaji was recognized as an independent ruler by the Sultan of Bijapur

 june 1665 main hui is sandhi ke mutabik shivaji 23 durg mughalon ko de denge or is tarah unke paas keval 12 durg batch jaayenge
 The income from these 23 fortifications was 4 lakh Huns annually

 Shivaji will support the Mughals against Bijapur
 shivaji ko agra bulaayaa gaya jahaan unhen laga ki unhen uchit sammaan nahin mil rahaa he
 Against this, he showed his fury in the court and accused Aurangzeb of betrayal
 aurangzeb isse kshubdh hua or usne shivaji ko nazarkaid kar diya or unpar 5000 sainikon ke pehre laga diye
 Aurangzeb intended to kill King Shivaji a few days later

 After the establishment of an independent Hindu nation in western Maharashtra, Shivaji wanted to crown his coronation, but Muslim soldiers threatened the Brahmins that whoever crowned Shivaji would be killed
 When this thing reached Shivaji that the Mughal Sardar is making such threats, then Shivaji took it as a challenge and said that now he will get anointed from the Brahmin of that state who is in the authority of the Mughals
 Shivaji's personal secretary Balaji sent three emissaries to Kashi, because Kashi was under the Mughal Empire
 When the messengers gave the message, the Brahmins of Kashi were quite pleased
 But the Mughal soldiers came to know about this and then caught those Brahmins
 But wisely those Brahmins told those messengers in front of the Mughal sannyko that we do not know who Shivaji is
 What line are they from? The messengers did not know that is why they said we do not know
 Then in front of the Sardar of the Mughal soldiers, those Brahmins said that we have to go somewhere else, from which clan Shivaji you have not told, so how can we crown him
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji

 Sambhaji gave him shelter in his place
 aurangzeb ne ab phir joardaar tareeke se sambhaji ke kilaaf akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Finally, in 1689, Sambhaji's wife's brother, Sambhaji, by the mouth of Ganji Shirke, made Sambhaji a prisoner by Mukarav Khan
 aurangzeb ne raja sambhaji se badasluki kii or bura haal kar ke maar diya

how do you dictate and often they just walk on their own pride, nothing can be useful in the face of belief
 Annual People who are some God knows him well and not the Koran that That no one but God can lie on their behalf but instead of what is present in front of them, there is nothing in them and there is nothing in it that all these are from the family of Jahan, do these people say that this Rasul himself has made a lie, if you say that if you are truthful, then make one sura equal to it and call it, other than God, whom you have to call, instead of whom Their hands did not reach them, although they did not get the impression in their minds, in the same way, those people who had preceded them - then consider what happened to the victims and the hawk is such that You will believe faith on this Quran and there are hawks who will not believe it and your family knows the crops very much, and if they deny you, then you say that for us Our car has passed and everything you do for me You are not responsible for that and i am exempt from what you do and the hawks are such that if you keep your ear to their tongue, then they will listen to you, not if they cannot understand anything, you have heard something for the deaf
 You and the hawk are among those who look at you, so if they do not think of anything, then you will show the way to the blind God, if you do anything at all i do not, but people commit crimes on their own and on the day God will collect these people, then these people will just stay there all day and recognize each other, those people who have refused to attend the barrage of God, they must You are in loss and did not have any instructions, o Rasool, the hawk, whom we have promised them, show you the eagle or pick you up, then all of them must return to us
 Then whatever these people are doing, God is a witness to that and every Ummah is special a rasul has happened, then when their rasul comes, they will be judged with justice through their justice and they will not be tortured at all, these people say that when you are truthful, when will it be fulfilled you tell me that i myself i am guilty of loss but not on profit, but whoever wants to be free, there is a time for every Ummah - when their time comes, neither a clock can move back nor can you move forward
 Or do you think that if his surprise comes upon you at night or day, then the guilty people are making haste at the end of the day, then when they come, will you bring eman on him? People will be told that you will be rewarded as your misdeeds, people ask you, is that all right? You say, i swear by your family is good and you cannot beat Te and jis who have persecuted if all the treasures which are in the ground If found, then you must pay for your crime, and when those people see Azab, then they will help Izhar and they will be punished with the justice of justice and they should be warned that whatever is in the ground and in the earth is God
 Be forewarned that the promise of God is sure, but often they do not know that he lives and he kills and all of you will be returned to the people You have advice in your heart from your family, and for those who believe in their medicine and faith, please tell them that you have got the blessings and blessings of God and your mercy, then those people should be happy on it and whatever it is You are saying that it is better than you are saying, what do you think that God has made a living on you, then now the hawk has started making the hawk halaal
 God has allowed you or do you bind yourself and people who Lying on God lies in the mind, what do you think of the daily doom, it is not that there is a lot of fear on the people, but many of them are not in the same condition, you are in some condition and you shout any verse of the Quran
 And you are implementing anything, we keep watching you when you are happy in that work and nothing can be missing from your family
 There is nothing in the earth nor in the sky, nor is there any thing smaller than it, nor is there any thing greater than that, but it is necessary to be safe in the light of the light book, it is not that there will be no fear on friends and neither will it be for the sake of God
 There are people who believed and feared, for those people, there is good news in the life of the poor and in the end, there is no change in the words of God, this is a big success and that Do not make things wrong, it is not enough that all the respect is just For the sake of God, he only listens to everyone
 Be aware that it is not that the people who are in anticipation and those who are in the ground are for themselves and those who call out from God, they do not walk on the path of justice but also He only goes on his speculation and he only talks gullible and interesting things, he is the one who made you for your benefit in the night so that you can rest in it and in the day that he will Look at the lady, there is not a lot of people who listen to them, in this, people have said that God has made a son - it is just that he is unconscious of all the Nakayas, who is in disarray and whatever You are the one who is in the ground, you say, you know, you lied to me, o Rasul, you tell me that the people who put sack on false lies, they will never succeed, there will be benefits of the world
 And then come back on our own punishment for their disbelief we shall strictly You will taste the joy of wonders and you read Noah’s condition in front of them when they said to their demos, If my people stay and discuss the verses of God, i trust you only then i trust you only then And all of you, together, get your work done right, then you are not just talking to me, then do not spend time with me and give me some time, but even if you turned your back, i i did not ask for some wages - my wages are only on my own and i have been ordered that i should be one of his coerced men, but they also denied him, so we and those who were with him Destroyed and made them alive and drowned those who had defied our verses, then consider what happened to those who were frightened, then after Noah we saw more Rasul If you send them to your community, then that prophet will come with them and light up Even after bringing these things which these people had previously denied, we do not stamp ourselves on the hearts of those who have gone through the same extent, then after these prophets we have again given Moses and Haroon with their blessings and When he was sent to his chiefs, those people stood up and these people were innocent, then when they reached the right place on our behalf, then they started saying that this is absolutely open magic and Moses said that Or when you come to him, you say about him that this is magic and the magicians will never succeed
 They started saying that why have you come to us that you deceived us from the humbleness on which we found our fathers' grandfathers? Two and all the land has increased both and these people are not going to believe you both and Firoun ordered that all the players in our war bring the magician, then when the magician comes c come exist in Moses told them that you even throw throw again When those people have put you, Moses said that what you have brought is magic - it is not that God will immediately destroy it, but God does not allow the work of the Mafsids to be correct and prove the true truth with the help of his imagination
 The tax shows that if the perpetrators are not allowed to live, apart from the few men of their community, apart from the fear of the demons and their chiefs, that they may put some trouble on them No one believed and did not believe that the Firoun Rue had increased greatly in the land and it was not sure that he was one of the persecutors, and Moses said, "if you have given your faith to God, then if you are absurd Just trust in them, they have requested that we have already relied on ourselves and prayed that you, our cradle, do not make us a test of abusive people and are of your own mercy i get rid of these infidels and we sent the same to Moses and his brother To build houses for your people in Egypt and to offer mosques to your own homes and to offer prayers from the sanctions, and to give good news to Mominin, and Moses said to us that you, our covenant, Pharaoh and his chiefs in the life of the world Arish and wealth have been given so that these people will mislead people through your path
 You will destroy their goods and harden their hearts till these people suffer
 You will not see the wonders, i will not believe that you have prayed, then both of you should prove your step and do not walk on the path of fools and we have made Israel across the river
 Followed them - even when he started drowning, he said that i have no faith except the God on whom Iman is built, and i am from the bonded prisoners
 OE is now time brings faith has Nafrmani so Halaॅki before and thou If we were among the mischief, then we will not save your body today so that you will be of peace to those after you, and it is not that your people are unaware of our enemies and we have made Israel a very good place and They were given good things to eat, so until they have met, they have not taken care of it, not only in these things in which these arms are fighting On the Day of Judgment, your family will decide in it, if the question that we have revealed to you, if you have anything about it, then ask the people who read the book before you, see if you have it towards your family If the book has come to you, then you must not be from those who do it at all, nor should it be from those who have denied the verses of God, you are also from those who make losses
 It will not go that the people whom your family talks about are complete When those people have come to see the painful wonders, i will not bring Imaan, if there is a lot of presence in front of them, why is there any settlement that if Iman accepts it, then he would have benefited from his Iman, yes, when the nation of Yunus brought Imaan, we made the world In life, they lost their wonder of life and we let them rest for a specific time and if your family wants, then all the people who are on the ground are all Do you want to force people to come so that they can bring honesty, so that everyone can be honest, however, no one should be allowed to believe that God is allowed to live without faith and those who do not work with wisdom will only take the dirty of God It is said that you can see that there is something in the sky and in the ground, and those who do not accept their faith and intimidate them Fid not these people they Muntijhr of penal sentences which passed Npr members Khbl them Have already said that i am waiting for you too; i also wait with you for sure
 Then we save our tastes and the people who believe in them
 Give that if you are really worried about my deen, then apart from God, you too do not try to enlist the people, but i pray for that god You will pick me up and i am commanded that i am the mother, and also to maintain my attitude towards the poor and do not turn away from muskareen and call upon something that cannot save you from God
 Neither can harm be done, if you do, then you will also be in oppressions and if any evil touches you from God, then no one is going to defend it
 And if you intend to do well with you, then its fuzzles and actions There is no one to wrap whoever he wants to benefit from his monkeys, and he is a very good kind, you tell me that you have got the right from your family, then the person who walks on the straight path will only do it on his own i will instruct for you and the person who accepts the disappearance will go astray and lose something and i am not responsible for you and you have You are the one who is sent the 'same', you just defend it and be patient, even God himself will give you the judgment through the kafirs and he is better than all those who decide

 To make the slab permanent, one has to add bicellular oxides such as calcium oxide or sis oxide
 rasinic niyam ke anusaar, jitne hi adhik padaarth milaae jate hai dravanank bhi utana hi kam ho jaataa he
 Each substance produces some special properties in the kach and keeping these properties in mind, the mixtures of the kach are made
 casium oxide kaach ko rasinic sthayitv pradaan karata he, par adhik maatra main hone par kaach main vikachan hone kii pravriti aa jaati he
 Ordinary kach is made from a mixture of sand, soda and lime
 calcium oxide ke liye kaach mishran main chuunaa yaa chuunaa-pathar milaayaa jaataa he
 Boric acid or icing produces special physical properties in the sachets, such as lower diffusion coefficient and greater stress tolerance, thermal endurance, and greater water-resistance

 These substances are called 'purifying materials'
 saadhaarant: shodhak dravya ke liye carbon ammonium lavan yaa arsenic prayukt hota he
 Potatoes, beetroot and wet wood pieces are also poured into liquid liquor to purify the flour
 kaach kaa upyog aisi kai prakaar kii vasatuon main kiya jaataa he jinamein vibhinn bhautik gunon kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Variations in the physical properties of the kach can be brought about by different oxides
 bhautik gun kaach main upasthit prayek oxide kii aapekshik maatra par bhi nirbhar karata he
 Density- In kach, the highest density comes from sis oxide and the lowest by boric oxide
 vaidyut gun- kaach kii vidyucchalakata uski rachana, taap evam vaataavaran par nirbhar hoti he
 Nowadays, kach is also being used for dielectric
 tapiya gun- tapt karne par kaach prasaarit hota he, par boric oxide evam magnesium oxide ke kaach main nunatam prasar hota he or kshareey oxide se adhiktam prasar
 Heat conductivity - Kach is the least conductor of heat; Silica and boric oxide have lower heat conductivity in the sludge
 kaach ke anya bhautik gun, jaise yang kaa pratyasthata-gunank, tanaav shakti, dridhtaa tathaa tapiya sahansheeltaa, kaach main pade oxidon par nirbhar hote hai
 By studying the effect of these in the sludge, the chemical sludge, the heat-resistant slurry, which can be heated red and cooled completely in ice, and the thermometer sludge are produced

 botalon kii pushtataa kii pariksha ke liye botalon ke bheetar jal bharkar jal kii daab dhire-dhire badhaai jaati he ki bottlen fat jaaen
 Thermal tolerance - The amount of sudden heat change that a vessel can bear without breaking it is called thermal tolerance of the coil
 is gun ke pareekshan ke liye kaach kii vastuon ko jal main vibhinn tapon tak garam kar barf se thande kiye gaye jal main achaanak dubo dete hai
 Pasteurization, cooking utensils, lamp chimneys, chemical slabs and thermometer hose, require high thermal tolerant grips
 kaach main adhik tapiya sahansheeltaa utpann karne ke liye silica kii maatra adhik or kshar kii maatra kam honi chahie tathaa kaach main kuch maatra main jasta oxide, boran oxide or aluminium oxide bhi hona chahie
 Optical properties- Optical properties in lenses, such as high alternation and deflection, are also dependent on the amount of different oxides in the glass and therefore reducing the amounts of sis oxide, barium oxide, and calcium to produce valuable swatches of particular frequency and deflection
 Can go parabangnee prakaash ke pargaman ke liye pardavashpadip kaa kaach kaachiya silica kaa banaaya jaataa he, kyonki ye rashmiyaan saadhaaran vyapaarik kaach ke paar nahin ja sakati he; parantu dravit quartz ke paar ye saralata se ja sakati hai
 Viscosity - Viscosity is also an essential property in the construction of wood, because the blast, grinding, traction, and rolling of the stick depend very much on the viscosity of the stick; Elimination of deformity is also directly related to viscosity
 kaach kii shyanta kaach ke oxide avyavon par nirbhar karti he
 Increasing the amount of silica increases the viscosity of the glass; Viscosity increases with the growth of lime, but viscosity-range is reduced
 soda kii maatra badhaane se shyanta ghatati he, par shyanta-paraas badhata he
 When the slurry object is heated, the outside surface becomes hotter than the inner parts and similarly when the heated liquid slurry is cooled and solidified, the outer surface of the slab is more solid than the inside
 It gets cold
 taap main antar hone ke kaaran kaach main asmaan prasar yaa akunchan aa jaataa he, jiske falswaroop uske bheetar pratibal utpann ho jate hai or kaach main tadnurup vikrutiyaan aa jaati hai
 The sludge remains hot at the time of manufacture, so when cooled, stress and deformation occur in the sludge
 inako hataane kii kriya ko kaach kaa abhitaapan kaha jaataa he
 In this method, the items of the slag are again heated uniformly at a temperature less than the temperature of the slab
 isse shyanta ke parivartan ke kaaran kaach vikrutiyon se mukt ho jaataa he
 The kach is then cooled very slowly
 yah abhitaapan-paraas bhi kaach ke oxide avyavon par nirbhar rahata he
 More alkali slabs can be impregnated at sufficiently low temperatures
 jatil kaach kaa, jaise rasinic kaach ushma pratirohak kaach kaa, abhitaapan taap bahut unchaa hota he
 There is a lot of convergence in optical waves; Because they have to cool very slowly in which they are often deformed

 Doorways and optical masks have to endure weather
 at: yah aavashyak he ki in kaachon main aise gun hon ki purvokt sanksharanon kaa unpar nunatam prabhaav pade
 The stability of the sachets is dependent on the amount of different oxide components of the sachets
 sthayitv badhaane ke liye sarvottam padaarth jasta oxide he or iske baad aluminium, magnisium or calcium oxide hai
 The stability of the kach decreases with the addition of alkali
 boric oxide 12 pratishat tak kaach kaa sthayitv badhaata he or taduparant sthayitv ghatata he
 Increasing silica in place of alkaline oxides also increases stability
 rangeen kaachon ke nirmaan ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke varnakon ko kaach-mishran main daalaa jaataa he

 The Hindu people consider the Ganges river as sacred as mother and goddess
 hinduon dwaara devi rupi is nadi kii puja kii jaati he kyonki unka vishwaas he ki isamen snaan karne se saare paap dhul jate hai or jivan-maran ke chakra se mukti mil jaati he
 Pilgrims travel long distances to immerse the ashes of their families in the waters of the Ganges so that their loved ones can go directly to heaven
 haridwar, ilahabaad or varanasi jaise hinduon ke kai pavitra sthaan ganga nadi ke tat par hi sthit hai
 During Thailand's Loy Krathong festival, candles are burnt in boats in honor of Buddha and Goddess Ganga to get good luck and wash away sins
 ganga kii utpatti ke vishay main hinduon main anek manyataayen hai
 According to one belief, the water of Lord Brahma's kamandal appeared in the form of a woman named Ganga
 ek anya katha ke anusaar brahmaji ne vishnuji ke charnon ko aadar sahit dhoyaa or us jal ko apane kamandal main ekatra kar liya
 According to a third belief, Ganga is the daughter of King Himwan of the mountains and his wife Meena, thus she is also the sister of Goddess Parvati
 prayek manyata main yah avashya aata he ki unka paalan-poshan swarg main brahma ji ke sangrakshan main hua
 Many years later, a king named Sagara magically had sixty thousand sons
 ek din raja sagar ne apane samrajya kii samruddhi ke liye ek anushthan karavaaya
 An horse was an integral part of the ritual which Indra stole enviously
 sagar ne us ashv kii khoj ke liye apane sabhi putron ko prithvi ke chaaron taraf bhej diya
 He found it near the meditative Kapil sage in Patalalok
 yah maanate hue ki us ashv ko kapil rishi dwaara hi churaayaa gaya he, ve unka apmaan karne lage or unki tapasya ko bhang kar diya
 The sage opened his eyes for the first time in many years and saw Sagara's sons
 is drushtipaat se ve sabhi ke sabhi saath hajaar jalakar bhasma ho gaye
 The souls of the sons of Sagara started wandering as ghosts due to not performing the last rites
 jab dilip ke putr or sagar ke ek vanshaj bhageerath ne is durbhaagya ke bare main suna to unhone pratigya kii ki ve ganga ko prithvi par laayenge taaki uske jal se sagar ke putron ke paap dhul saken or unhen moksh praapt ho sake
 Bhagirath did penance of Brahma to bring Ganga to earth
 brahma ji maan gaye or ganga ko aadesh diya ki vah prithvi par jaye or vahaan se patallok jaye taaki bhageerath ke vanshajon ko moksh praapt ho sake
 Ganga found it very humiliating and decided that she would fall from heaven to earth with full speed and take it away
 tab bhageerath ne ghabaraakar shivaji se prarthana kii ki ve ganga ke veg ko kam kar den
 Ganga started falling on Shiva's head with arrogance
 lekin shiv ji ne shanti purvak use apni jataaon main baandh liya or keval uski choti-choti dhaaraon ko hi baahar nikalne diya
 Ganga became more sacred by receiving the touch of Shiva
 patallok kii taraf jaati hui ganga ne prithvi par bahane ke liye ek anya dhara kaa nirmaan kiya taaki abhaage logon kaa uddhaar kiya ja sake
 The Ganges is the only river that flows in the three worlds - heaven, earth, and hell
 isliye sanskrit bhashaa main use "tripathga" kaha jaataa he
 Due to the efforts of Bhagiratha as Ganga came to earth, she is also called Bhagirathi; And the term "bhagirathi endeavor" is used to describe adventurous efforts and difficult achievements
 ganga ko jahnavi naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is said that when Ganga was moving towards Bhagiratha after her arrival on earth, the velocity of her water caused quite a stir and destroyed the cultivation of Jahnu and his fields
 isse krodhit hokar unhone ganga ke samast jal ko pi liya
 The gods then prayed to Jahnu to release Ganga so that he could proceed for his work
 unki prarthana se prasann hokar jaahnu ne ganga ke jal ko apane kaan ke raste se bah jane diya
 Thus Ganga got the name "jahnavi"
 aisi manyata he ki saraswati nadi ke samaan hi, kalyug ke ant tak ganga puri tarah se suukh jaayegi or uske saath hi yah yug bhi samaapt ho jaayegaa
 After that, the golden age will rise
 skanda puraana jaise hindu granthon ke anusaar, devi ganga kartikeya kii sauteli mata hai; kartikeya vastav main shiv or parvati kaa ek putr he
 Parvati created the image of Ganesha through her physical defects, but Ganesha came alive after drowning in the holy waters of the Ganges
 isliye kaha jaataa he ki ganesh kii do maatayen hai-parvati or ganga or isiilie unhen dvimatra tathaa gangey bhi kaha jaataa he
 According to Brahma Vaivarta Purana 2
6
13-95, Vishnu has three wives who are always at loggerheads, so in the end he only kept Lakshmi with him and sent Ganga to Shiva and Saraswati to Brahma
 
 hinduon ke mahakavy mahabharat main kaha gaya he ki vashishtha dwaara shraapit vasuon ne ganga se prarthana kii thi ki ve unki mata ban jaaen
 Ganga descended on Earth and became the wife of King Shantanu on the condition that she would never question him, otherwise she would leave him
 The seven Vasus were born as their sons and Ganga poured them all one by one into their waters, thus liberating them from their curse
 is samay tak raja shantnu ne koi aapatti nahin kii
 Ultimately the birth of the eighth son did not stop the king and he opposed his wife, so Ganga left him
 is prakaar aathven putr ke rup main janma dyos maanav rupi nashwar sharir main hi funskar jivit rah gaya or baad main mahabharat ke sarvaadhik sammanit paatro main se ek bhishma ke naam se janaa gaya
 The mention of Ganga definitely comes in the Rigveda, the most ancient and theoretically most sacred book of Hindus
 ganga kaa ullekh nadistuti main kiya gaya he, jisame purv se pashchim kii ore bahane vaali nadiyon ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 The Ganges is also mentioned in RV 6
45
31, but it is not clear that the river itself is referred to here
 rugveda 3
58
6 main likhaa gaya he "aapkaa pracheen ghar, aapaki pavitra mitrataa, he veeron, aapaki sampatti jahnavi ke tat par he"
 This verse probably points to the Ganges
 aarvi 1
116
18-19 main jahnavi tathaa ganga kii dolfan kaa ullekh lagaataar do chhandon main kiya gaya he
 Many mythological stories are associated with the river Ganges
 inamen raja sagar kii katha or mithkon ke anusaar brahma ne vishnu ke pair ke paseenon kii boondon se ganga ke janm kii kathaon ke atirikt anya kathaayen bhi kaafii rochak hai
 According to another legend, King Sagar magically acquired sixty thousand sons
 ek din raja sagar ne devloak par vijay praapt karne ke liye ek yajna kiya
 The horse was necessary for the yagna which jealous Indra stole
 sagar ne apane saare putron ko ghode kii khoj main bhej diya ant main unhen ghoda pataal lok main mila jo ek rishi ke sameep bandhaa tha
 Sagara's sons insulted the sage, thinking that the sage was the reason for the horse's disappearance
 tapasya main leen rishi ne hajaaron varsh baad apni ankhen kholi or unke krodh se sagar ke sabhi saath hajaar putr jal kar vahiin bhasma ho gayi
 The souls of the sons of Sagar started wandering as ghosts because they were not cremated
 sagar ke putr anshuman ne atmaaon kii mukti kaa asafal prayaas kiya or baad main anshuman ke putr dilip ne bhi
 Bhagiratha was the son of King Dileep's second wife
 unhone apane purvajon kaa antim sanskaar kiya
 He pledged to bring the Ganges to Earth so that the ashes of his rites flow into the Ganges water and the wandering souls can go to heaven
 bhageerath ne brahma kii ghor tapasya kii taaki ganga ko prithvi par laayaa ja sake
 Brahma was pleased and agreed to send Ganga to earth and ordered Ganga to go to earth and then to Hades so that the souls of the sons of Sagara could be liberated
 tab ganga ne kaha ki main itani oonchai se jab prithvi par giruungi, to prithvi itnaa veg kaise sah paaegi? tab bhageerath ne bhagwaan shiv se nivedan kiya or unhone apni khuli jataaon main ganga ke veg ko roak kar, ek lat khol di, jisase ganga kii aviral dhara prithvi par pravaahit hui
 The stream followed Bhagiratha to the Ganges Sagar Sangam, where the sons and sons were saved
 shiv ke sparsh se ganga or bhi paavan ho gayi or prithvi vaasiyon ke liye bahut hi shraddha kaa kendra ban gayin
 According to the Puranas, Ganga is called Mandakini in heaven and Bhagirathi in Patala
 bharatvansh main shantanu naamak bade pratapi raja the
 One day while playing the game on the banks of the Ganges, he was seen Ganga Devi
 shantanu ne usase vivaah karnaa chaha
 Ganga accepted it on the condition that the king would not ask any question about what she would do
 shantanu se ganga ko ek ke baad ek saat putr hue
 But Ganga Devi threw them all into the river
 raja ne is vishay main unase koi prashn nahin kiya
 Later, when he was born the eighth son, Shantanu objected to throwing him into the river
 is prakaar ganga ko diya gaya unka vachan tut gaya or ganga ne apana vivaah radd kar swarg chali gayin
 While passing by, he promised Shantanu that she would raise her child and return to Shantanu
 ek prafullit sundari yuvati kaa janm brahmadev ke kamandal se hua
 There are two thoughts about this special birth
 ek kii manyata he ki vaaman rup main rakshas bali se sansar ko mukt karaane ke baad brahmadev ne bhagwaan vishnu kaa charan dhoyaa or is jal ko apane kamandal main bhar liya
 The second is related to Lord Shiva who saved the raga-ragini suffering from the misuse of music
 jab bhagwaan shiv ne naarad muni brahmadev tathaa bhagwaan vishnu ke samaksh gaanaa gaaya to is sangeet ke prabhaav se bhagwaan vishnu kaa pasinaa bahakar nikalne laga jo brahma ne use apane kamandal main bhar liya
 Ganga was born from the water of this kamandal and she started living in heaven under the protection of Brahma
 ganga, ek nadi hi nahin, bhartiya samskruti kii ek gauravshaalee sarita he
 Some 108 names like Devanadi, Jahnavi, Vishnupada, Shivashishadharini are of this river
 ‘mahabhagwat’ main ‘ganga ashtottarashat namavali’ milti he
 It is due to the virtue of this river that from Patki to Patki, there is immersion in this river from death to death
 yah aisi nadi he jiskaa zikr rugveda se lekar vartmaan sahitya tak main mil jaataa he
 Due to the influence of the tenacity of King Bhagiratha, it became a rage from Alaknanda and washed the Kalikalush of India
 ganga dashahra yaa gangadashami kaa parv 10veen sadi purv se hi manaaya jaataa rahaa he
 Bhojraj has commemorated this day in 'rajmandand' as a festival for the prevention of decapacities
 jo das paap hare, vah yah parv he
 These sins have been first mentioned by Manu in his memory, which have been cited by other Puranas, sub-writers as well as 'skanda Puranakara'
 murtikla main ganga kii abhivyakti nai nahin he
 As a woman, the river began to be engraved in the form of Kalashdharini heroine
 visheshkar dwarshakha ke neeche murtimay rup main ganga kaa nyaas miltaa he
 This river form in many forms and in many expressions, indicates the presence of the devotees of the temple to sin-free, Kalushaharini
 ek ore yamuna, duusari ore ganga
 These are also considered to be a confluence of western and eastern cultures
 koi bhi bhashaa, dharm-vichaar ho, yahaan antat: ekta kaa darshan hota he
 Therefore, the culture of India is also called ganga-jamni
