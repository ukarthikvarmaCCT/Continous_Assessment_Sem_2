 Cappuccino This is an Italian coffee drink made with espresso, hot milk and steamy condensed milk froth
 yah naam kapuchin fryrs se padaa he jo unki aadaton ke rang se judaa he
 Cappuccino is a coffee on which frothy milk is poured
 ise bhaap banane vaali aspreso mashin main banaaya jaataa he
 First espresso coffee is added to one-third of the bottom of the cup and then an equal amount of hot milk is added to it
 phir upree ek-tihaai hisse main, ek yaa do minute pehle taiyaar kiye gaye gadhe doodh kaa jhaag milaayaa jaataa he, is jhaag ko aksar bade kalatmak tareeke se aise sajaayaa jaataa he ki yah ek nukile tile kii tarah dikhaai de
 Decorations are often made by sprinkling peeled chocolate, raw sugar, cinnamon, and other spices over a perfectly prepared drink
 phir kapuchino kaa seven ek chote chammach se kiya jaataa he
 In traditionally made cappuccino coffee, as found in professional coffee houses in Europe and America, espresso coffee, milk / foam amounts are approximately the same 150–180 milli
 In commercial coffee chains in the US, cappuccino is often offered as a 360-mile intoxicating or large drink
 capuchino banane ke liye upyog kiye jane vaale aspreso mashiinon ko 20 veen sadi main pehali baar prastut kiya gaya jab milan ke luigi bezera ne 1901 main sabase pehle ise patent ke liye daakhila karavaaya
 19veen sadi kii shuruyaat main hi, italy main capuchino kaa vikaas hua or isaki lokapriyata main bhi khub badhotaree hui jab kaife or restaraan main upyog kii jane vaali badi-badi aspreso mashiinon main, vishwa yuddh II ke dauraan or uske baad bhi kaafii sudhaar kiya gaya, khaskar tab jab 1948 main gaagia naamak italian company ne aadhunik, ucch-dabaav vaali aspreso mashin prastut kii
 By the 1950s, the present form of this drink had developed
 italy main capuchino ko subah ke peya ke rup main piya jaataa he or subah ke 11
00 baje ke baad to log ise bahut kam pite hai
 In the United Kingdom, espresso coffee initially gained a lot of popularity as a cappuccino, as the British preferred to drink milk coffee, but the desire to enjoy the amazing texture of the drink and enjoy its flavor for longer
 The café became its destination to complete
 aspreso coffee ke ek hisse ke alaava, kapuchino banane kii vidhi main sabase mahatvapurn baat he doodh kii banaavat or uskaa taapmaana
 kapuchino banane ke liye jab barist doodh ko bhaap main ubaalata he tab doodh main hawa ke bahut hi baarik bulbule chode jate hai jisase microfom banataa he or doodh ko ek makhmali banaavat milti he
 In traditional cappuccino, the barista pours hot frothy milk over the espresso coffee, so that the drink is 2 cm above the drink
 The thicker the foamy layer of milk becomes
 in mishranon kii vividhta ke naam hai: kapuchino cairo ) jisamen doodh kii maatra saamaanya se adhik hoti he or kapuchino skaro ) jisamen gadhe doodh kii maatra saamaanya se kam hoti he
 In order to make the foam in the right proportions, it is very important to keep a close watch when boiling the milk in steam, so it is considered very difficult to make cappuccino perfectly in all beverages made with espresso

 Traditionally, people living in Europe, Australia, South Africa, South America, and some regions of North America liked the taste of cappuccino
 1990 ke dashak ke madhya tak uttar america main ucch darje ke coffee house ubharne lage or kapuchino uttar amareeki logon ko adhik vyapak rup se uplabdh hone laga
 In Italy and throughout the continent of Europe, cappuccino was traditionally consumed with some sweet pastries in the morning breakfast
 saadhaarant: europea log kapuchino kaa seven subah ke naashte ke alaava kisi anya bhojan ke saath nahin karte, balki puure din bhar tathaa raat ke bhojan ke baad aspreso pinaa pasand karte hai
 However, in recent years, Europeans have started drinking cappuccino throughout the day
 vishesh rup se pashchimi europe main dopaher main kaife or chhaton par baithkar or raat ke bhojan ke baad restaraan main kapuchino kaa lutf uthaanaa bahut hi lokapriy dincharya he
 In the United States, with the growth in the American coffee industry in the late 1990s and early 20th century, a wide variety of cappuccino became extremely popular, especially in urban areas of the Pacific Northwest
 thande kapuchino ko kapuchino fredo kehete hai, jisamen akasar peya ke upar thanda jhaagdar doodh daalaa jaataa he
 This drink is widely available in areas of Italy where ice is not added to this drink
 For example, this drink is already prepared and kept in every 'bar' in Rome
 par uttari shaharon main, jaise milan main, kapuchino fredo kaa milanaa lagbhag asambhav si baat he
 Rather, "gelato da bere" or "shakerato" are more popular than this
 yah shabd ab puure bumadhya kshetra main bhi prachlit ho chukaa he, yahaan peya ko pesh karne ke kuch kshan pehle jhaagdar doodh milaayaa jaataa he, jo vidhi akasar multah italian vidhi se alag he
 In North America, if "cappuccino fredo" or "iced cappuccino" is offered without its characteristic, frothy milk, the name may be considered inexact
 udahaaran ke liye, 'starbax' main, jhaagdar doodh ke bagaiyr banaae peya ko 'iced latte' kehete hai
 Cold milk can also be made foamy in various ways
 21 veen sadi ke shuru hone tak, 'starbax' jaise fast-food chens kapuchino ko ek badale rup main, arthath bade or alag-alag naap main pesh karne lage the600 mili 
 lekin pichley kuch varshon se, pramukh swatantra kaife kapuchino ko sirf uske paaramparik naap150–180 mili ke anusaar pesh karne lage hai- jisase unhen anya kaife or bade fast-food chens se ek alag pahchaan milti he
 a "small" cappuccino is also found in 'starbucks' 240 milli, but it is neither mentioned in the menu nor on the website
 kapuchino kii vyapak sweekruti ke baad suvidhajanak dukaanon jaisi anek pratishthanon kaa janm hua or ye pratishthan apane graahakon ko kapuchino naam kaa ek peya pesh karne lage
 Generally, it is made by beverage machines, like a beverage made from a coca mixture, either from a ready mix or from double brewed coffee
 is tarah banaaya gaya peya niyamit kapuchino se bilkul alag hota he
 The specialty of cappuccino available in convenience stores is that it is prepared from pre-stored hot water in a machine called high-speed cyclonic mixing chamber
 mashin ko sakriy karne par uskaa viping impeler ghoomane lagata he, tab sookhe powder kaa mishran or pani ko chember main daalaa jaataa he, purnataya taiyaar peya kaa gaadhaapan is baat par nirbhar / niyantrit hota he ki powder kaa mishran kitni jaldi daalaa gaya
 The formation of foam by this process is natural
 kuch mashiinon main aisi suvidha hoti he ki chote-chote dispozable pauchez main sangrahit vibhinn swaad ke taral padaarth kii thodi si maatra ko coffee main milaayaa jaataa he or is tarah ek hi mixing chember main 'moka' or 'bhanila' jaise alag-alag swaad vaale kapuchino taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Since all materials are either mixed in dry powder form or in non-rotatable disposable packaging, these methods require very little maintenance, just cleaning the mixing chamber and impeller
 rakh-rakhaav ko or kam karne ke liye, jab oparator 'phil batan' ko dabaata he to adhikansh mashine bagaiyr powder ke bhi kuch kshanon tak chalati rahati hai taaki mixing chember main saafe pani bah sake or chember kii safaai ho jaae
 In addition, ready-to-use blends are also produced in homes

 At one time on the dusk day of Shukla Paksha of Jyeshtha month he went to drink water on a reservoir while he was hungry for two days
 usee sthaan par ek tatkaal kii byaahi hui pyaasi gau jal pi rahi thi
 The king removed the thirsty cow from drinking water and started drinking water himself, so the king had to suffer this sorrow
 ekadshi ke din bhookha rahane se vah raja hua or pyaasi gau ko jal pite hue hataane ke kaaran putr viyog kaa du:kha sahanaa pad rahaa he
 Hearing this, everyone started saying, o sage! The atonement of sins is also written in the scriptures
 at: jis prakaar raja kaa yah paap nasht ho jaae, aap aisa upaay bataaie
 Lomash Muni started saying that fasting of Ekadashi of Shravan Shukla Paksha which is also called Putrada Ekadashi, you all fast and awake at night, it will destroy the sin of this former birth of the king, along with that the king must get the son Will be
 lomash rishi ke aise vachan sunakar mantriyon sahit sari praja nagar ko waapas laut ai or jab shravan shukla ekadshi ai to rishi kii aagyaanusaar sabane putrada ekadshi kaa vrath or jaagran kiya
 After this, on the day of Dwadashi, the fruit of its virtue was given to the king
 us punya ke prabhaav se rani ne garbh dhaaran kiya or prasavkaal samaapt hone par uske ek bada tejasvi putr utpann hua
 That's why, Rajan! This Shravan Shukla Ekadashi was named Putrada
 at: santan sukh kii ichha hasil karne vaale is vrath ko avashya karen
 By listening to its greatness, a person is freed from all sins and in this world, children will enjoy happiness and attain heaven in the hereafter
 putrada ekadshi paushashukla main bhi padati he == inhen bhi dekhen == Lakshmi Raman Acharya was the MLA in the First Assembly of Uttar Pradesh, India

 The history of modern banking services in India is two hundred years old
 bharat ke aadhunik banking kii shuruyaat british raaj main hui
 The British East India Company started 3 banks in the early 19th century - Bank of Bengal in 1809, Bank of Bombay in 1840 and Bank of Madras in 1843
 lekin baad main in teenon bainko kaa vilay ek naye bank 'imperial bank' main kar diya gaya jise san 1955 main 'bhartiya state bank' main vilay kar diya gaya
 Allahabad Bank was the first private bank in India
 bhartiya rigerv bank san 1935 main sthapit kiya gaya tha or baad main punjab neshnal bank, bank of india, kenra bank or indian bank sthapit hue
 Initially, the branches and business of banks were limited to commercial centers
 bank apni sevaayen keval vanijyik pratishthanon ko hi uplabdh karaate the
 Prior to independence, the Reserve Bank of India was active as the central bank of the country
 jabaki sabase pramukh bank imperial bank of india tha
 At that time, there were three types of banks in India - scheduled banks, non-scheduled banks and foreign scheduled banks
 swatantrata ke uparant bhartiya rigerv bank ko kendriya bank kaa darja barkaraar rakhaa gaya
 It was also declared a 'bank of banks'
 sabhi prakaar kii maudrik nitiyon ko tay karne or use anya bainkon tathaa vittiya sansthaaon dwaara lagu karaane kaa daayitv bhi use saunpa gaya
 The controlling and regulatory powers of the Reserve Bank of India have played an important role in this task
 bhartiya rigerv bank kaa rashtriyakaran swatantrata ke uparant san 1949 main kiya gaya
 a few years later, in 1955, the Imperial Bank of India was also nationalized and renamed as State Bank of India
 aage chalakar san 1959 i
 main bhartiya state bank adhinium banaakar aath kshetreey bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran kiya gaya
 Presently, these eight banks are called State Bank of India group banks
 in aathon bainkon ke naam - state bank of hyderabad, state bank of bikaner and jaipur, state bank of indaur, state bank of mysore, state bank of travankor ityadi hai
 He has about 15,000 branches across the country
 desh ke pramukh chaudaa bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran 19 july san 1969 i
 ko kiya gaya
 These were all commercial banks
 isi tarah 15 april san 1980 ko nijee kshetra ke chha: or bank rashtriyakrut kiye gayi
 The branches of all these twenty banks are spread all over the country
 vartmaan main kul 19 rashtriyakrut bank hai
 The Reserve Bank of India allowed thirteen new domestic banks to start banking activities in January 1993

 The length of which is the highest among the five rivers flowing in Punjab
 yah pakistan main hokar bahati he
 At an altitude of 4,600 meters above sea level in southwestern Tibet, it originates from the demon Tal near Mansarovar, where it is locally called Logchen Khambav
 udgam sthal se himachal pradesh main pravesh karne se pehle yah pashchim kii ore mudakar kailash parvat ke dhaal ke paas bahati he
 From here, this river flows through deep ravines and the gradual elevation of the mountain ranges converges into plinths in the Sutlej valley
 himachal pradesh ke pahaado se apana rasta tay karaate huye yah nadi punjab ke nangal main pravesh karti he
 a dam is built on the Sutlej in Bhakra, Himachal Pradesh, a few kilometers above Nangal
 baandh ke peeche ek vishaal jalashay kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he, jo govind sagar jalashay kehalaata he
 The Bhakra Nangal Project produces hydroelectric power, which is supplied to Punjab and adjoining states
 punjab main pravesh ke baad yah nadi dakshin-purv ke ropar jile main shivalik pahadiyon ke bich bahati he
 In Ropar itself it descends from the mountain into the plain, from here it turns sharply towards the west and flows in the middle of Punjab, where it divides the Best Doab and Malwa
 harike main beas nadi sutluj main milti he, jahaan se yah dakshin-pashchim kii ore mudakar bharat or pakistan ke bich seemaa rekha nirdhaarit karti he

 Valmiki Ramayana describes Bharata crossing Shatadru while coming from Kekay to Ayodhya
 mahabharat main punjab kii anya nadiyon ke saath hi shatadru kaa bhi ullekh he
 In the Srimad Bhagwat, it is mentioned along with Chandrabhaga and Marudavriddha etc
 - 'sushoma Shatadrushchandra Bharamadruvradha Vitasta' vishnu puraana main shatadru ko himavan parvat se nissruth kaha gaya he- 'shatadruchandrabhagadya himavatpadanirgtah'
 In fact, the source of Sutlej is a lake called Ravanahanad which is west of Mansarovar
 vartmaan samay main sutluj 'bias' main milti he
 But Reberti, author of 'the Mihran of Sindh and Its Trivities', holds that' Sutlej, before 1790 AD, was not found in Bias
 is varsh bias or satluj donon ke maarg badal gaye or ve sannikat aakar mil gai
 'shatadru' is a variation of Vedic Shutudri and can be interpreted as a river with hundred streams
 jisase isaki anek upanadiyon kaa astitv ingit hota he
 Greek writers have called Sutlej a Hezidrus
 kintu inke granthon main is nadi kaa ullekh bahut kam aayaa he
 Because Alakshendra's forces had withdrawn from the Beas river and they had little knowledge of the country east of Beas
 punjab kii samruddhi ke peeche sutluj kaa bhi yogadan he
 The dam built at Bhakra on Sutlej not only supplies electricity, but it also saves a large part of the state from flooding

 Generation of electric power from other sources of energy is called power generation
 vyaavhaarik rup main vidyut shakti kaa utpaadan, vidyut janitron dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The basic principle of electricity generation was discovered by the British scientist Michael Faraday during the 1920s and early 1930s
 taar kii ek kundalee ko kisi chumbakeey kshetra main ghumaakar vidyut utpann karne kii micel farade kii mul vidhi aaj bhi usee rup main prayukt hoti he
 Where electricity is produced, it is called a power plant
 bijligharon main vidyut-yantric janitron ke dwaara bijli paidaa kii jaati he jise kisi kisi anya yukti se ghumaya jaataa he, ise mukhyaghurnak yaa pradhan chaalak kehete hai
 For prime movers, it can be water turbine, vapor turbine or gas turbine
 vidyut shakti, jal se, koyale aadi kii ushma se, nabhikeey abhikriyaaon se, pawan shakti se evam anya kai vidhiyon se paidaa kii jaati he
 For electric power, in fact, three components are necessary: chaalak, jo vyaavhaarik rup main ek nirdhaarit vyavastha ke anusaar yojit samvahak samooh hota he, The magnetic field is practically obtained by flowing an electric current in a coil and chaalak samooh ko chumbakeey kshetra main ghumaane kii vyavastha, jiskaa taatpary he yantric urja kaa praavdhaan
 In fact, the same mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy and energy renders the law of impermanence
 uparyukt vivechan ke aadhaar par kisi bhi vidyut janitr ke teen mukhya avyav hote hai : 1
 The armature holding the conductors, usually made of cast iron slab levels, is formed around the circumference, in which conduction coils are placed
 chaalkon ko ek nishchit vyavastha ke anusaar yojit kiya jaataa he, jise armechar kundalan kehete hai
 2
 Field coil - magnetic field is generated when current flows in it
 3
 yantric shakti kaa sambharak - yah saadharantaya ek pradhan chaalak hota he
 It can be a water turbine, steam turbine, steam engine, or any diesel engine
 dhara ke praroop ke anusaar vidyut janitr, mukhyat:, do praroop ke hote hai : disht dhara janitr or prayavarti dhara janitr 
 Although the basic principles of both are basically the same, they differ greatly from the perspective of design
 disht dhara janitr main chumbakeey kshetra achal kshetra kundaliyon dwaara utpann kiya jaataa he or armechar par aropit chaalak tantra ghurnan karata he
 Thus, cutting the magnetic current produces a voltage in it
 vastut:, voltata ke janan ke liye yah aavashyak nahin ki chaalak main hi gati ho
 It may also be that the conductor is stationary and the magnetic element will be biting them
 This means that the magnetic field is moving and the conductor remains in its place
 kisi bhi prakaar se chaalak tathaa chumbakeey kshetra main aapekshik gati hona aavashyak he, jisase chaalak main voltata janit ho sake
 In fact, both methods are practical and in alternating current generators, also called alternators, the driving group is fixed and is called a stator
 chumbakeey kshetra utpann karanevaale dhruv or kundali ghurni bhaag hote hai or unhen roter kehete hai
 The main advantage of keeping the armature fixed is that in this way relatively higher voltages can be generated
 ucch voltata janan ke liye yaa to chaalak kii sankhya badhaani padati he, athwa ghurnanveg, yaa donon hi
 Increasing the number of conductors greatly increases the size of the armature and due to its rotational portion the centrifugal force will increase so much that from the standpoint of the structure it will also be a problem to keep the drivers stationary at their locations
 bade aakaar ke ghurni bhaag banaavat ke drushtikon se upyukt nahin hote or na unka veg hi bahut adhik badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the generation of high voltages is limited in generators with rotational armature, but if fixed, its size can be made even larger and the centrifugal force is also not questioned
 saath hi janit dhara ko sthir sansparshakon se le janaa hota he, jo bahut sugam ho jaataa he
 The current generated in rotational armors can be transported to the outer circuit only by couches
 kshetra ke roter hone main samasya itani jatil nahin hoti, kyonki usamen pravaahit honevaali uttejk dhara, saapekshatya, bahut kam hoti he
 Excitation is possible only by direct current, and field excitation in alternating current generators requires a direct current resistor, which is usually provided by a small direct current generator on the same shaft, called exciter
 armechar chaalkon main chumbakeey kshetra ke saapeksh, aapekshik gati ke kaaran janit honevaali voltata, vastut: prayavarti praroop kii hoti he
 Its magnitude at any given moment depends on the relative position of the drivers of the magnetic field
 disht dhara janitr ke armechar main bhi isi prakaar kii voltata prerit hoti he, par ek dikparivartak dwaara use bahari paripath main adisht dhara ke rup main praapt kiya jaataa he
 The problem converter is fitted with the armature at the same point, and the armature conductors are arranged according to a certain arrangement from its copper blocks
 dhara ke dikparivartak se bahari paripath main le jane ke liye burushon kaa praavdhaan hota he, jo saadharantaya carbon ke hote hai or burush dharak main lage hote hai
 As far as mechanical power is concerned, it can be obtained either from a turbine or from an engine, or from the flowing water of the river, which contains a store of infinite power
 praytn to kiya ja rahaa he ki samudr ke jowar bhaate main nihit urja ko tathaa jwalamukhi parvaton main chhipi hui asmi shakti ke bhandaron ko bhi kaam main laayaa jaae
 The use of atomic power is growing rapidly for power generation and many large nuclear power plants have been built, but so far, mainly, three types of power houses are common: hydro, steam and diesel engine driven
 panbijlighar aise sthanon main banaae jate hai jahaan kisi nadi main sugamawapurvak band baandhakar paryaapt jal ekatrit kiya ja sake or use aavashyaktaanusaar oonchaai se nalon dwaara giraakar jal tarabine chalaae ja saken
 These turbines are the main drivers of electric generators
 parvato se bahanevaali nadiyon main aseem jalashakti nihit hoti he
 To build such power plants, the entire area is first surveyed and the most suitable place is found where a minimum possible ditch and cost can be built as large as possible
 aise bijligharon kii laagat bahut adhik hoti he, par unka prachaalan vyay bahut kam hota he
 The installation of such power stations depends mainly on the appropriate location
 yah ho saktaa he ki ye bijlighar udyog sthal se bahut dur hon
 In this case, very long transmission lines may also have to be built
 atev aise bijligharon ke nirmaan kaa arthuchity siddh karne ke liye sancharan duuri tathaa uski sajja kaa vichaar rakhana bhi aavashyak he
 Steam powered power stations have steam turbines
 bhaap injanon kaa upyog to ab vyaavhaarik rup main puraani baat ho gai he
 Steam turbines, in general, operate at high speeds and are designed for continuous operation
 adhikansh tarabinon main ucch dabaav par bhaap prayukt kii jaati he, jiske liye ucch dabaav ke vaashpitra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The pressure of 600 pounds per square inch is now normal and modern turbines are being built to operate at even higher pressures
 tarabine bhi ab is kshetra main safaltaapurvak prayukt hone lage hai
 Constant new research is being done in the design of turbines to increase the efficiency of steam-powered power stations even more
 aajkal parmanviya bijligharon kii sthapana main adhik dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 Nuclear power plants have been built in many countries and big plans are being made
 britain, america tathaa rus main pichley 10 varshon main bahut bade bade parmanviya bijlighar banaae gaye hai or bahut se banaae ja rahe hai
 Their main advantage is that they can be made adjacent to the load centers, which does not require long transmission lines
 iske atirikt, eendhan kii maatra atyant kam hone ke kaaran, parivahan vyay tathaa uski samasya nahin rahati
 But their installation expenses are relatively high and then their operating system is still a subject of research
 pranaaliyon main nity nae anusandhan ke kaaran inaki sthapana kaa nishchay bahut hi vivaadaaspad he
 The system which was adopted five years ago is now gone
 duusare, inhen keval bade rup main bananaa hi aarthik tathaa pravidhik rup se uchit ho saktaa he
 It is not usually possible to use all the power produced at the same site
 yah avashya mahatvapurn he ki shakti ke duusare strot nirantar samaapt hote ja rahe hai, athwa kaha ja saktaa he ki unamem se adhikansh antat: samaapt hone ko hai
 It is estimated that if coal consumption continues in this world, then the existing coal mines can continue to supply coal to the world for a maximum period of 200 years
 isi prakaar tel kii utpatti ke vishay main bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 The hydroelectric reserves are not exhaustive, but these reserves are generally far away from the sites of use
 udhaahrant:, brahmaputra nadi ke jal main, bharat kii seemaa main pravesh karne ke sthal par, lagbhag 35 lakh kivaa
 shakti kii kshamta he
 Firstly, it is not so easy to set up a power station there and secondly this place is about 500 miles away from the usage sites
 bharat main lagbhag 40v109 ton koyala hone kaa anumaan he or jalavidyut shakti, jiskaa uplabdh hona sambhav he, lagbhag 40v106 kivaa
 he
 These figures seem very hopeful, but if our level is also similar to that of the United States and other dynamic countries and the consumption of electricity per person is high, then so much power will also be very inadequate for us
 aisi dasha main yah swaabhaavik he ki parmanviya shakti kaa upyog kiya jaae
 Diesel engines are also used for small towns, or individual feeders of small industries
 ye set adhiktar kam kshamta ke hote hai
 They cannot be built in large sizes like hydroelectric power plants and thermal power stations and the relative power per unit value of power produced is also much higher, but they are very useful for small supplies
 inhen aasaani se chalaaya ja saktaa he or kuch hi minuton main bhaar lene ke anukool ho jate hai
 For this reason they are very useful as additional accumulators
 deazal chaalit bijligharon ko bhi, jo aarthik rup se manhage hone ke kaaran band kar die gaye hai, atirikt sanchayak ke rup main prayukt kiya ja rahaa he
 Diesel engines are being replaced by gas turbines nowadays
 gas tarabine kii dakshata inaki apeksha kahin adhik hoti he or ve bade aakaaron main bhi nirmit kiye ja sakate hai, parantu ve bahut adhik taap evam dabaav par prachaalan karte hai
 It is necessary to operate at even higher temperatures for greater efficiency and it has not yet been possible to manufacture materials that can be used practically in the manufacture of gas turbines
 at: gas tarabine vidyutsakti ke utpaadan main bahut saamaanya nahin ho paaya he
 Nature has infinite means of electric power
 uparyukt jane maane sadhano ke atirikt, kuch aise saadhan bhi hai jinaki ore pichley 50 varshon main hi manushya kaa dhyaan aakarshith hua he
 There is unlimited power in the tide of the sea
 france evam britain main is shakti kaa bhi vidyut utpaadan ke liye upyog kiya gaya he
 At the time of sea tides, the water moving towards the mouth of the river is filled in the reservoir surrounded by an opening dam
 jowar ke samay jalashay main pani bhar jane ke baad, bhaate ke samay, vah samudr main waapas nahin jane diya jaataa
 Then the water of this reservoir can be used for hydroelectric generation just like a power plant with a low head
 aise bijligharon main nalikaay evam tarabine kaa ranor aisi dhaatu, saamanyat: kaansa, kaa hona chahie jisapar samudr kaa khaaraa pani rasinic pratikriya na kar sake
 Plans are also being made to build Jowar Bhatta power plant in India and it can only be estimated that normalization of such power stations will happen in the next 20 years
 bhutapiya urja: shakti kaa doosraa aseem saadhan jwalamukhi parvaton ke antstal main nihit bhayankar taap he
 If this surface can be pierced and its hot gas can be used in the evaporators of the power house, then the reserves of infinite power will open
 newzealand main aise bijlighar ko kriyaatmak rup diya gaya he
 There 30 gz a powerhouse of k is using the power of a volcano
 italy evam japan main bhi aise bijligharon kii yojana banaai ja rahi he or is prakaar abhi tak jo jwalamukhi apni bhayankarta ke liye hi prasiddh the, ab upyogita ke kshetra main bhi agraganya ho jaayenge
 Solar Energy: The Sun is also a limitless means of electric power
 abhitak to keval prayogtmak rup main hi ise vidyutsakti ke utpaadan ke liye prayog kiya gaya he, parantu sahaara evam arab ke registaanon kii chilchilaati dhoop main saura bijlighar banane kii yojanaayen banaai ja rahi he or aashaa kii ja sakati he ki yah bhavishya main sabase mahatvapurn saadhan ban jaayenge
 Wind energy: So far, wind has been used only to run a mill and to extract water from the well
 parantu germany evam holland ke kuch duurastha ilaako main iskaa upyog chote janitr kaa chalaane ke liye bhi kiya gaya he, jisase vidyutsakti utpann ho sakati he
 Due to the uncertainty of air flow, its use has not been common, but small wind-powered plants may be useful for remote areas
 vastut: bijli kii maang dino din badhati ja rahi he or manushya ko nity nae sadhano kii khoj he, jisase is badhati hui maang kaa puraa kiya ja sake
 The written genealogy of the Brahmin and Karna Kayastha communities of Mithila is called register or register management
 yah haridwar main prachlit hindu vanshavali jaisi hi he
 The register system began in the seventh century
 iske antargat logon kaa vanshavriksh rakhaa jaataa tha
 At the time of marriage, care was taken that seven generations should be born from the bride's side and six generations from the bride's side

 hawa ko bhi unhone tatv mana
 The most obvious idea regarding the element was put forward by Robert Boyle in 1661 AD
 usne tatv kii paribhaasha yah di ki ham tatv unhen kahengen, jo kisi yantric yaa rasinic kriya se apane se bhinn do padaarthon main vibhajit na kiye ja saken
 The stall considered four elements were acid, water, earth and phlogiston

 The discovery of radioactive elements made it clear that the element is not inseparable by Boyle's definition
 prakruti main uranium vibhakt hokar swayan duusare tatwon main parinat hota rahata he
 Experiments have also made it possible that we can divide elements and create new elements in our laboratories
