 Compass means 'summarization'
 do yaa do se adhik shabdon se milakar bane hue ek naveen evam sarthak shabd ko samaas kehete hai
 For example, 'home for kitchen', we can also call it 'kitchen'
 sanskrit evam anya bhartiya bhashaaon main samaas kaa bahutayat main prayog hota he
 Compass is also used a lot in German and other languages
 samaas ke niyamon se nirmit shabd samasik shabd kehalaata he
 It is also called Samastapada
 samaas hone ke baad vibhaktiyon ke chihn lupt ho jate hai
 Like - Rajputra
 samasik shabdon ke bich ke sambandhon ko spasht karnaa samaas-vigrah kehalaata he
 After the Deity, composite words such as Raj + Son - Son of Raja are omitted
 samaas main do pad hote hai
 The first term is called Purvapada and the second term is Uttarpada
 jaise-gangaajal
 It has Ganges east and water north
 sanskrit main samaason kaa bahut prayog hota he
 Other Indian languages also have compound usage
 samaas ke bare main sanskrit main ek sookhti prasiddh he: There are six distinctions of compound: jis samaas kaa pehla pad pradhan ho or vah avyay ho use avyayibhav samaas kehete hai
 Such as - Yathamati, Aamrna are Yatha and Aa Avayya
 jahaan ek hi shabd kii baar baar aavriti ho, avyayibhav samaas hota he jaise - dinondin, ratorat, ghar ghar, haathon-haath aadi Some other examples - avyayi samaas kii pahchaan - isamen samast pad avyay ban jaataa he arthath samaas lagane ke baad uskaa rup kabhi nahin badalata he
 There is no inflection mark with it
 jaise - upar ke samast shabd he
 Test tatpurush samaas - jis samaas kaa utaarpad pradhan ho or purvpad gaun ho use tatpurush samaas kehete hai
 Eg - Tulsidaskarit = Created by Tulsidas gyatavya- vigrah main jo kaarak prakat ho usee kaarak vaala vah samaas hota he
 According to the names of the persons, there are six distinctions of the Tattpurush Samas
 jis samaas main pehla pad nishedhaatmak ho use nana tatpurush samaas kehete hai
 like - jis samaas kaa utaarpad pradhan ho or purvpad va utaarpad main visheshan-visheshya athwa upmaan-upmey kaa sambandh ho vah karmdharay samaas kehalaata he
 like - jis samaas kaa purvpad sankhyavachak visheshan ho use dwigu samaas kehete hai
 This gives a sense of group or group
 jaise - The compound whose two terms are predominant and when the deity takes place is the 'and', or, 'or', and the additive sign is called duality compound
 jaise- mata-pita ,bhai-bahan, raja-rani,du:kha-sukh, The compound whose two terms are inaccessible and have a symbolic meaning dominant in addition to the meaning of the whole is called polygamy
 jaise - In Karmadharaya, one term of the whole-word is an adjective of another
 isamen shabdaarth pradhan hota he
 Like - Neelkanth = Blue throat
 bahuvrihi main samast pad ke donon padon main visheshan-visheshya kaa sambandh nahin hota apitu vah samast pad hi kisi anya sangyaadi kaa visheshan hota he
 With this, the meaning is secondary and any difference becomes dominant
 jaise - nil+kanth = nila he kanth jiskaa shiv
 
 sandhi varnon main hoti he
 It does not omit inflection or words
 jaise - dev + aalay = devalayas
 The compound occurs in two terms
 samaas hone par vibhakti yaa shabdon kaa lop bhi ho jaataa he
 Like - mother and father = parents
 yadi aapako lagata he ki sandesh lambaa ho gaya he, to acha hoga ki aap samaas or vyas donon main hi apane vishay-vastu kaa pratipaadan karen arthath jaise kisi shodh lekh kaa prastutikaran armbh main ek saransh ke saath kiya jaataa he, vaise hi aap bhi kar sakate hai
 Some ancient quotes are also being given about it
 --- arthath maharishi ne is mahaan gyaan kaa sankshep or vistaar donon hi prakaar se varnan kiya he, kyonki is lok main vidvajjan kisi bhi vishay par samaas or vyas donon hi reetiyaan pasand karte hai
 --- That is, those methods are easily understood, which are characterized by symptoms and trait
 keval lakshan yaa keval prapanch utana prabhavakaari nahin hota

 However, the development of the modern Essar Group began in the 1950s when Nand Kishore Ruia left Rajasthan to set up his business in Chennai in the Tamil Nadu region
 Ruia strengthened his business roots by establishing an export business for the region's iron ore mining industry
 1966 tak is group ne bandargah main jahaazon par maal ladane or un par se maal utaarne kii seva pradaan karnaa shuru kiya or khadaanon se kshetra ke bandargahon tak louh ayask kaa parivahan karne laga

 However, after the sudden death of the father in 1969, control of the family business had passed into the hands of Shashi and Ravi Ruia
 apane umr ke biswein padaav main donon ruia bhaaiyon ne paariwarik vyavsaay kaa vistaar karne or ise bharat ke sabase safal or sabase vividh samuhik companiyon main se ek ke rup main viksit karne kaa bidaa uthaaya
 1960 ke dashak ke ant main donon bhaaiyon ne pehle se hi shipping bazaar ko apana nishaanaa banaaya or 1969 main essar-balk cargo kariyaron kaa shubharambh kiya
 The operation originally facilitated the transportation of the group's iron ore export materials; By the mid-1970s, however, the company began to provide a variety of ship chartering and transportation services

 The group was in the headlines in 1999 when it was forced to default on about $ 250 million in Eurobond debt
 21veen sadi main nae sire se vikasessar samooh kii pareshaaniyon kaa kuch hissaa iske tej vividhikaran se sambandhit tha
 As Ravi Ruia told reporters in 1994 about the company's strategy, "we can enter into any new business that gives us more money
 


 Today the canvas is fully open
" hamaare paas mukt vichaar hona chahie

html # ixzz1c2okkn9h saanchaa:essar Group Promotion is to change the position of an employee in an organization and give it above that
 kisi bhi sanghathan main karyrat carmikon kii kaarykushalta unki santushti tathaa manobal ke str se bhi prabhavit hoti he
 Promotion means 'elevation of office' is an important dimension of modern personnel administration
 padonnati, pad, str sammaan main vruddhi karne yaa yogyata ke aadhaar par aage badhane se sambaddh he
 Promotion is also called 'internal recruitment' or 'indirect recruitment'
 padonnati kii nimna visheshtaayen yaa lakshan hai – Promotion is related to the attainment of a higher position from the current position
 ucch pad ke praapt hone par us par kaa vetanman, daayitv tathaa nayaa pad-naam padonnat carmik ko dey hote hai tathaa isse karmchaaree kii pratishtha tathaa santushti donon kaa str unchaa hota he
 The utility of the promotion process is undeniably important
 padonnati ke kaaran ek taraf sanghathan kii jeevantata bani rahati he to duusari ore karmchaariyon kii mahatvakankshaon kii purti bhi hoti he
 In short, promotion has the following importance - ummidavaar kii yogyata ko sahi rup main jaanane ke liye aajkal 'agyaat saakshaatkaar' lokapriy hota ja rahaa he
 In this, the candidate does not know that his test is being taken
 hota yah he ki pad rikt hone par bharteekarta sambhavit ummidavaaron par drushti rakhata he or jab uske dhyaan main kuch aise log aa jate hai to vah ek vishesh bhaashanmala kaa aayojan kar detaa he
 Here potential candidates are invited to give speeches
 is paddati se ummidavaar ke vyaktitv ke sarvangin paksh par moolyankan karnaa saral ho jaataa he
 There are two types of promotion in India - padonnati ke do pramukh siddhanth prachlan main hai – Promotion based on seniority is a traditional and simple system
 iske anusaar us carmik ke pehle padonnati milegi jisaki seva avadhi dusron kii tulana main adhik hogi
 The promotion started on the basis of seniority during the reign of the East India Company
 yah siddhanth anbhavi carmik ko puraskaar main vishwaas karata he
 This type of promotion has benefits or qualities like fairness, personnel availability, automation, building morale, justice-setting, avoiding ego clashes etc
 On the other hand, there are many defects
 varishthata ke kaaran padonnati milane se sanghathan main yogya carmik baahar janaa pasand karte he
 Many employees do not even take interest in work because promotions are available on time
 britain ke nausenadhyaksh fisher ne ek baar kaha tha– british samrajya nasht ho jayega, kyonki isamen varishthata ke siddhanth kaa paalan kiya jaataa he
 In fact, the principle of seniority will also be directly mitigation of merit
 pratham vetan ayog ne yah suzav diya tha ki loksevaon main pratyaksh bhartee tathaa padonnati ke bich vivekpurna saamanjasy hona chahie
 The Commission believed that qualification should be preferred over seniority for promotion in the context of higher posts
 yogyata aadhaarit padonnati vyavastha ko ab shaniah–shaniah manyata mil rahi he
 In a society with current competitive trends, merit is bound to be recognized
 padonnati main yogyata ko aadhaar banane se mahatvakankshi, karttavyanishthattha utsaahi carmikon ko prerana praapt hoti he, prashasnic kaary kushalta badhati he tathaa prashasan main navachaar yaa parivartan prakriyaayein kriyanvit kii ja sakati hai kintu is siddhanth ke kaaran jab kam kanishtha vyakti ucch pad par pahunch jaataa he to varisht carmikon kaa ahan aahat hota he saath hi carmik asahyog evam sangharsh pravritiyon ko dhaaran kar lete hai
 Prof
 Willoughby has described two grounds of eligibility for promotion - pad vargeekaran ke samay prayek pad ke kaaryon, dayitvon evam yogyataon kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Knowledge, skills, experience, educational qualifications, gender, residency, technical skills etc
 are prominent among these qualifications
 jis pad ke liye padonnat kiya jaataa he uske liye sabhi aavashyak yogyataayen sambandhit pratyaashee main honi chahie
 Without these, the name of an employee cannot be considered for promotion
 jab ye aavashyak yogyataayen nirdhaarit kii jaati he tabhi yah tay ho jaataa he ki padonnati ke liye pratyaashiyon kaa kshetra vyapak rahegaa athwa sankeern
 Like individual qualifications, another basis of eligibility for promotion is the level of service of the candidates
 iske antargat yah nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he ki padonnati ke liye sambhavit pratyaashee kahan se praapt kiye jaayenge
 It is usually determined in the rules of service that for filling the vacancy of a particular post, promotion will be done from the post immediately below the same post or from any employee of the organization or from any employee of that bureau Whose organization is only a part or any employee of the department concerned or any employee of the entire government service
 in vikalpon ko nishchit kar dene par padonnati kii rekhaayen spasht ho jaati hai
 An organizational restriction is often imposed on the area of eligibility for promotion, and promotions are usually made under the same department or bureau, inter-departmental promotions are not supported
 is vyavastha kii haani yah he ki iske falswaroop karmchaariyon ke padonnati ke avasar kam rah jate hai, saath hi yogya pratyaashiyon kaa sambhavit kshetra bhi chota ho jaataa he
 The relative impact of the above benefits and losses depends on how wide the field of service or organizational unit is
 pro vilobi kii manyata he ki vibhinn karmchaariyon kii seva kii sharton main baari antar rahata he, isliye yadi un sabhi ke liye ekarup vyavastha sthapit karne kii cheshtaa kii gai to yah ghaatak hoga
 From this point of view some general principles can be determined, these are the following - padonnati vyavastha kii vifaltaa anek baar to saamaajik, aarthik or rajnatik kaarnon se hoti he
 Sometimes this also happens because the Savvy class management is not familiar with the basic features of a suitable promotion system
 pro vilobi ne sankshep main in visheshtaon kaa ullekh nimna prakaar kiya he – After adopting the above characteristics, it becomes very certain that the promotion of employees will be done on a scientific basis and not only qualified persons can be appointed in various higher positions but the satisfaction of its fairness in the minds of the concerned and potential employees
 a sense of will also be awakened
 prayek padaadhikari is sambandh ke saath sarvshereshth kaary karne ke liye ek prabhaavshaalee abhipreran rahegi kaaran vah na keval vartmaan pad ke kaaryon ko bhalee prakaar sampann karegaa varan bhavi pad ke liye bhi taiyaar rahegaa
 The ideal promotion system has two aspects - in donon baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue stall mahoday ne mukhyatah nimnlikhit suzav prastut kiye he jinhen apanaakar adarsh padonnati vyavastha ko lagukiya ja saktaa he – This fast is kept on Tuesday on the second day of the week
 ek nihsantaan brahman dampatti kaafii duhkhi the
 The Brahmin went to worship in the forest and wished for a son from Hanuman
 ghar par uski stri bhi putr kii praapt ke liye mangalvaar kaa vrath karti thi
 At the end of the fast on Tuesday, Hanuman used to eat food after offering it to Lord Hanuman
 ek baar vrath ke din brahmani naa bhojan bana paayi or naa bhoga hi laga saki
 Then he pledged to eat food on the next Mars itself
 bhukhe pyaase chah din ke bad mangalvaar ke din tak vah behiosh ho gayi
 Hanuman ji was pleased to see his loyalty and dedication
 use darshan dekar kaha ki ve usase prasann hai or use balak denge, jo ki uski seva kiya karegaa
 After this, Hanuman ji became impassioned by giving him a child
 brahmani isse ati prasann ho gayi or us balak kaa naam mangal rakhaa
 After some time, when the Brahmin came home, looking at the child and asked who he was
 patni ne sari katha bataayi
 The Brahmin thought that his wife was an adulteress
 ek din mauka dekh brahman ne balam ko kune main gira diya or ghar par patni ke poochne par brahman ghabaraaya
 Mars came back from behind
 brahman aashcharyachakit rah gaya
 At night, Hanumanji told him all the stories in his dream, then the Brahmin was overjoyed
 fir vah dampati mangal kaa vrath rakhkar anand kaa jivan vyateet karne lage
 This story is done by fasting on the day of Mangalwar, which is a wonderful story, this story was told by Lord Krishna to Abhimanyu

 The DNA properties of genes in every human is in the formulas and is a mixture of DNA mixed with both mother and father
 lekin manushya ke do sthaan kaa diene mishrit nahin hota
 First, the DNA of mitochondria in both men and women comes only from their mother
 doosraa, keval purushon main unke waahe gun sutara kaa diene keval unke pita se aata he 
 There is no major change in the DNA of the mitochondria and the waa property formula for tens of thousands of years, and the classification of the entire human race into ancestral groups and maternal groups based on the DNA of the mitochondria and waa property formula can be done
 agar do vyaktiyon kaa ek hi matruvansh samooh he to kaha ja saktaa he ke in donon kii maatayen hazaron saal purv jivit kisi ek hi mahila kii santati hai
 If any two men have the same ancestral group, then it can be said that the father of these two is the progeny of the same father, living thousands of years ago
 striyon kaa kisi pitruvansh samooh se sambandh nahin hota kyonki striyon main waahe gun sutara nahin hota
 Generally, the DNA of the quality formula goes from father to son without any significant changes
 lekin hazaron saal main kabhi-kabhaar kisi purush ke is diene main aisa utparivartan ho jaataa he jis se usamen saralata se pahachaane jane vaale chinh aa jate hai
 It is highly unlikely that two men have the same mutation
 aane vaali pidiyon main jis bhi purush main yah chinh hoga uske bare main yah kaha ja saktaa he ke vah usee pehle utparivartit purush kaa vanshaj he
 It can be said that this man has established his new ancestral group
 yah bhi dekha jaataa he ke kisi utparivartit purush ke vansh main hazaron varsh baad kisi vanshaj purush main ek or nayaa utparivartan ho jaye jis se swayan uske apane upavanshaajon ko aasaani se pahachaanaa ja sake 
 Now the descendants who will be in front of this second man will have signs of mutation of the first man and also of mutation of the second man
 yah bhi dekha ja saktaa he ke dusre pitruvansh samooh ke sadsy pehle pitruvansh samooh ke upavanshaj hai
 For example, members of the ancestral group R1a are the progeny of the ancestral group r and the members of the ancestral group r themselves are the descendants of the ancestral group P

 jaise-jaise manushya faile saath-saath yah utpariwartanon kaa silsilaa bhi jari rahaa
 a mixed study of genetics and history is being done to find out which mutation took place at which place and in which era
 isliye kisi bhi purush ke waahe gun sutara kaa diene ko dekhakar bataaya ja saktaa he ke uske purush purvaj africa se shuru hokar kahan-kahan or kab-kab based
 For example, if an Indian male's ancestral group is J2, it can be said that prior to India, his male ancestors lived in the region of Middle East and Turkey, because the ancestral group J2 itself is a branch of the ancestral group j which is the Middle East and Turkey
 Originated in pitruvansh samooh je swayan or pitruvansh samoohon kii shakha he jo pitruvansh samooh fif se utpann hui hai
 The ancestral group f is speculated to have originated in India, but its ancestors came back from Africa
 is prakriya se pitruvansh samooh je2 vaale is bhartiya purush ke purush purvajon kaa itihaas saamne aata he - ke ek lakh saal pehle ve africa main shuru hue, phir bharat aaye, phir unhone pashchim kaa rukh kiya or turki ke paas ja kar bas gaye or phir bharat laut aaye
 It is seen that even today in Turkey and Iran there are many men of the ancestral group J2
 to yah daawey ke saath kaha ja saktaa he ke qareeb 20,000 saal pehle is bhartiya purush or in sabhi turk, irani or arab purushon ke pita ek hi the
 Similarly, there is a tree of the matrilineal groups and any male or female can be told by DNNA of their mitochondria that their ancestral mothers lived in different places in which ages

 nirvana kaa shabdic arth he - 'buja hua' 
 But it has special meaning in Buddhism, Jainism and Vedic religion

 "nibbana" in Pali means "to attain salvation" - that is, freedom from the fire of greed, hatred and confusion

 Part of the category of yadhyapi 'mukti' ke arth main nirvana shabd kaa prayog gita, bhagwat, raghuvansh, sharirak bhashya ityadi nae-puraane granthon main miltaa he, tathaapi yah shabd baudhon kaa paribhaashik he
 In Sankhya, Nyaya, Vaiseshika, Yoga, Mimamsa and Vedanta, the words Moksha, Upvarga, Dishayarayas, Mukti or Swargapriya and Kaivalya have been treated, but in Buddhist philosophy only the word Nirvana has come and is specifically interpreted
 buddha dharm kii do pradhan shakhaayen hai—hinayan or mahayan 
 Of these, all the texts of the Hinayana branch are in Pali language and represent the original form of Buddhism
 mahayan shakha kuch peeche kii he or uske sab granth saskrit main likhe gaye hai
 In the Mahayana branch itself, Buddhist doctrines have been represented philosophically by the esoteric logic by many masters
 pracheen kaal main vaidic aacharyon kaa jin buddha aacharyon se shastrarth hota tha ve praayah mahayan shakha ke the
 Therefore, what is meant by the word Nirvana can be decided by his words
 bodhisattva nagarjun ne madhyamik sutara main likhaa he ki 'bhavasantati kaa uchchhed hi nirvana he', arthath apane sanskaron dwaara ham baar baar janm ke bandhan main padate hai isse unke uchchhed dwaara bhavabandhan kaa naash ho saktaa he
 In the Ratnakootasutra, Buddha says: Nirvana is caused by the loss of raga, malice and attachment
 bajrachchhedika main buddha ne kaha he ki nirvana anupadhi he, usamen koi sanskaar nahin rah jaataa
 In relation to Nirvana, the secondary author Chandrakirti has said that the omnipresence of omnipresence is called nirvana
 yah shoonyata yaa nirvana kya he ! na ise bhav kah sakate hai, na abhaav
 Because the loss of knowledge of both emotion and absence is the name of Nirvana, which is beyond and beyond both the non-sense and the non-sense
 madhavacharya ne bhi apane sarvadarshansangrah main shoonyata kaa yahi abhipraay batalaaya he—'asti, naasti, ubhay or anubhay is chatushkoti se vinimunkti hi shoonyatv he'
 In the Secondary Sutra, Nagarjuna has said that the experience of existence and nostalgia is undesirable
 budhimaan log in donon kaa apshamrup kalyaan praapt karte hai
 It is clear from the appropriate sentences that there is no receptive relation of mind to the emptiness of the word nirvana
 mai bhi mithyaa, sansar bhi mithyaa
 One thing to note is that Buddhist philosophers do not believe in nature or even the nature of the soul
 ve ek mahashunya ke atirikt or kuch nahin maanate
 Part of the category of buddha ne nirvana ko man kii us param shanti ke rup main varnit kiya jo trishna, krodh or duusari vishaadakaari man:sthitiyon se pare he
 a creature who has found peace in life, who has compassion for all and who has abandoned all desires and shackles
 This peace is attained only when all the present desires cease and the desires that may arise in the future are destroyed
 In nirvana, due to craving and malice, they are eliminated from the root, leaving man from all kinds of sufferings or the cycle of rebirth in the world
 paali ke siddhanton main nirvana ke duusare drushtikon bhi hai; ek ke anusaar ye usee tarah he jaise kisi bhi tathy main riktatako dhundhna
 saath hi ise chetana kii sampurna punarvyavastha or chetan kii paraten kholane kii tarah bhi dikhaaya jaataa he
 Scholar Herbert Geanter states that nirvana makes "ideal personality, true human being" a reality
 dhammapad main buddha kehete hai ki nirvana hi "param anand" he
 This bliss is everlasting and paramount which is an integral part of the peace that comes from enlightenment or bodhi
 yah anand nashwar vastuon kii khushi se ekadam alag hoti he
 Knowledge associated with nirvana is expressed through the word Bodhi
 buddha nirvana kii vyakhya ko "sahaj" man ke rup main karte hai
 a mind that has reached a state of complete clarity and comprehensibility due to the end of desires
 buddha ne iskaa varnan "mrityuhinata" ) tathaa param aadhyatmik gyaan, jo vah sahaj parinaam he jo sadaachari jivan vyateet karne or shreshth aath-sutreey adarsh path par chalane par miltaa he ke rup main kiya he
 From such a life is made of the treaty of karma and vaana
 nir kaa arth he "alag hona, dur hona yaa uske bina" or wan kaa arth he "mukti" jaise "bahati hawa" or "soonghnaa, ityadi"
 The Abhidharma-mahavibhasha-shastra, which is an all-round idea, describes all possible meanings of the word originating from Sanskrit: sutron main nirvana ko kabhi bhi ek sthaan ke rup main nahin mana gaya he, balki ise sansar kaa hi virodhabhas mana gaya he, jo vastav main agyanta kaa paryaay he
 
 Having said: nirvana kaa sateek arth he- gyaan kii prapti- jo man kii pahchaan ko khatm karke mul tathy se judaav paidaa karata he
 Theoretically, Nibbāna is said to be a mind that is "not coming and not going" and has attained a state of perpetuity, leading to "liberation"
 sthirataa, sheetaltaa or shanti bhi iske arth hai
 The attainment of nirvana is compared to the end of avidya
 jisase us man:sthiti kii ichha jaagrit hoti he jo jivan chakra se mukti dilaati he
 The world is basically a product of craving and ignorance
 a person can attain Nirvana even without death
 jab nirvana praapt kar chuke vyakti kii mrityu hoti he, to us mrityu ko moksh ] kehete hai, kyonki vah jivan-maran or punarjanm ke aakhri judaav se purna rup se chhot jaataa he or uskaa phir se janm nahin hota
 buddha dharm sansaarik astitv ke ant ko param lakshya maanata he or yahi nirvana kii prapti he; aise vyakti kii mrityu ke pashchaat kya hota he,parinirvāṇa ye samajhaayaa nahin ja saktaa, kyonki ye anubhav manushya kii samaj kii seemaa se pare he
 Through a series of questions, Shariputta convinced a monk that Tathagata could not be considered true or reality even in his present life, so it would not be right to speculate on the situation after the death of Arhant
 See Tathagata # Inscrutable ek str kaa gyaan praapt karne ke baad vyakti nirvana ko maansik chetana kii tarah anubhav karata he
 According to some beliefs, if one goes on the path of Nibbana, it leads the Arahant towards the attainment of enlightenment and samadhi
 ant:karan ke vikaas se is sthiti par pahunchane par yadi yogi ko ye pataa chalata he ki ye sthiti banaavati he or isliye nashwar he, to sabhi bandhan khatm ho jate hai, vyakti arhant ban jaataa he or nibbaan kii prapti hoti he
 The mind is aware; It is conscious
 nirvana se chetana khulti he or man is asahaj vishwa ke sabhi bandhanon se mukt hokar jaagruk hota he
 The Buddha has described this in many ways
 inamen se ek is prakaar he: Consciousness is formless, it has no end and it is stunning from all sides
 ajaan pasanno or ajaan amaaro likhte hai ki vigyaan shabd chetan kii gunvattta ke sandarbh main dekha jaataa he
 According to him "vinānāna" should be understood more than its literal meaning: "buddha, like many philosophers equivalent to him, used the language understood by the common people in a larger scope, rather than the pretentiousness and hypocrisy of learning, which made his The message can be understood as much as possible
 So 'knowledge' can be taken here in the sense of 'knowing', but not partial broken, discriminatory knowing, which usually means Interpretation is
 balki iskaa arth hona chahie praarambhik or utkrisht gyaan, nahin to jis sandarbh main isaki baat ho rahi he, vahaan virodhabhas dikhaai degaa
" phir unhone aage bataaya ki in shabdon ke chayan ke peeche kya kaaran rahaa hoga
 ye "aprakat chetana" chah indriyon kii chetana se bhinn he, baaki chetnaaon kii ek "sataha" hoti he, jinaki vajah se pratikriya utpann hoti he
 According to Peter Harvey, ancient texts have two opinions on the issue of whether the word "conscious" is accurate or not
 a liberated person experiences it spontaneously
 ek vyakhya ke anusaar, "prakashwan chetan" nirvana ke samaan he
 Others do not agree with this, according to him, it is not nirvana, but it is a kind of consciousness that only the arhants attain
 majzima nikaay main ise rikt sthaan kii tarah bataaya gaya he
 For the liberated people, there is no need for the meditation of light consciousness, mental consciousness associated with Nibbana, and it is superior to all parts of mental consciousness
 yah buddha purv ke upanishdaur bhagavadgitake atmagyaan kii avadharana se purnat: bhinn he, jo vyakti kii antarman kii chetana ko jagaane kii baat karte hai, jabaki isamen is pahalu par jor nahin diya gaya he or isamen kisi bhi tarah "swa" se bhramit nahin hona chahie
 iske alaava, buddha ke chathe dhyaanake anusaar, ye aseemit chetana ke kshetra main utkrisht hota he, jo swayan "main" ke mithyabhimaan par samaapt nahin hota
 Nagarjuna has also hinted at two places on the level of consciousness in Dignikaya
 unhone likhaa he: The monk declared that earth, water, fire and air, long, short, fine and hard, good, etc
 are all extinguished in consciousness
 

 yahaan lanbaa or chota, maheen or sakht, acha or bura ye sabhi naam or rup samaapt ho jate hai
 The idea associated with this, which is supported in Pali theory and contemporary Theravada, while it is not mentioned in Theravada Bhashya and Abhidhamma, states that the mind of the Arahant is Nibbana
 mahayanabuddha dharm main, nirvana or sansar ko jab dharmakayaki param prakruti ke taur par dekha jaataa he, to ye donon pruthak-pruthak nahin hai
 a person can attain Nirvana through the Buddhist path
 agar ye donon ekadam alag hote to aisa sambhav nahin hota
 yani nirvana or sansar kaa dwaitvaad paaramparik taur par hi sateek he
 Another way to arrive at this conclusion is the analysis that all facts are empty of an essential identity, so suffering is not congenital under any circumstances
 Therefore, freedom from grief and its causes is not a non-material process
 is vichaar kii or vyakhya ke liye dwisatya siddhant ko dekhen
 Theravadmat indicates the mutual contradiction between the world and Nibbana, where the quest for liberation begins
 saath hi, yahi virodhabhas param lakshya kii ore bhi le jaataa he, jo vastav main sansar main utkrisht hona or nibbaan ke raste mukti kii prapti he
 Theravada is in many ways different from the Mahayana doctrine, which itself begins with the dualism of the world and nirvana, showing this polarization not just as an initial text, but it leads to a larger experience of monotheism
 
 paali sutara ke drushtikon se buddha or arhant kii pidaaen or tehraav, yani sansar or nibbaan pruthak-pruthak hai
 Both views agree that Shakya Muni Buddha attained nirvana while living in this world, as he was seen by all to be free from the world
 vishuddhimaarg Ch
 I, v
 6, buddhaghosh ne nirvana ke path ke liye paali siddhant main kai vikalp dikhaae hai, jinamein shaamil hai: On the basis of one's analysis, all these options reflect the three-point teaching of the Buddha's stated qualities, mental development and knowledge
 nirvana ko vishuddh, gaiyr dwaitvaadi 'utkrisht man' kii tarah dikhaane kaa vichaar mahayan / tantric granthon main bhi miltaa he
 Samput, for example, describes: 'vaasana or bhaavnaatmak dosha se rikt, jis par dwaitvaadi drushtikon ke badal na hon, aisa utkrisht man hi vastav main param nirvana he
 ' kuch mahayan paramparaon ke anusaar buddha ko marichika main dekhte hai, jisamen pratyaksh dikhne vaale ko nirvana kii sthiti se upar uthne kii tarah dikhaaya he
 According to Professor Etienne Lamote, the Buddha is always and at all times in nirvana and his physical body and form on earth is actually elusive
 lamote buddha ke bare main likhte hai:'unka janm hua, wo sambodhi ko praapt hue, unhone dharm chakra ko chalaaya or nirvana kii prapti kii
 haalanki ye sab bhram he: buddha ke prakatya main aane, thaharne or jane kii avasthaaon kaa lop he; unke nirvana ye darshaate hai ki wo hameshaa or har samay nirvana kii sthiti main rahete hai
 ' kuch mahayan sutara aage jaakar nirvana kii prakruti kii visheshtaayen bataane kaa praytn karte hai
 The main themes of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, which is basically the boundary or metal of nirvana, discusses the four essential components from which Buddha creates nirvana
 jinamein se ek he 'swa', jise buddha ke sthaayee swayan ke rup main vishleshit kiya jaataa he
 William Edward Suthill and Louis Hods, explaining Nirvana on the basis of Mahayana, say: 'nirvana sutara ye daawa karte hai ki pracheen vichaar jaise sthayitv, paramanand, vyaktitv, shuddhta hi utkrisht nirvana kii ore le jate hai
 The Mahayana declares that Hinayana, denying that there is no personality in the transcendental realm, in fact denies the existence of Buddha
 mahayan main, antim nirvana utkrisht he or ise paramaki sangya di gai he
 ' jab ye shaastra likhaa gaya, tab pehle se hi nirvana or buddha ke bare main kaaphi sakaaratmak baaten kahi ja chuki thim
 According to the initial idea of buddhism, nirvana is characterized by stability, joy and purity
 use "main hum" kii mudra kaa pratikaar karte hue dikhaaya gaya he or ye swabhranti kii sabhi sambhaavnaaon se pare he
 The Mahaparinirvana Sutra, a long and large scripture of Mahayana, shows Buddha using "himself" to conquer non-buddhist people
 isi se aage kaha gaya he: "buddha kii prakruti swayan kii nahin he
 Self has been used to guide sentient beings
 " The scripture Ratnagotra department associated with this, states that the teachings of the Tathagatagarbha are intended to win over sentient beings and to end "self-association" - one of the five deficiencies of non-buddhist teaching
 Yoru Wang in the Lankavatara Sutra also finds the use of a similar language, then writes: "seeing that this reference is necessary
 ye hamen is nishkarsh par pahunchane se rokegaa ki tathagatagarbha ke vichaar se ye sirf ek parloukik kalpana bhar thi
 "however, some people have objected to this conclusion associated with the Mahaparinirvana Sutra and claimed that the Buddha proclaimed that he was himself, emphasizing his own reality in these lines: 'kai kaarnon or paristhitiyon ke chalate maine bhi ye shiksha di ki swayan hi swayan se pare he
 While it is actually myself, i have taught that there is no self but there is nothing wrong with it
 buddha-dhaatu sravayan rahit he
 When the Tathagata teach that there is no self, they do this because of eternity
 tathagat swayan hai or wo swayan nahin hone kii shiksha dete hai kyonki unhone samprabhutaa kii prapti kar lee he
 ' nirvana sutara main buddha ne kaha he ki ab vah ab tak gopneey rakhe gaye siddhanton kii shiksha denge or gaiyr-swayan par unki pehle di gai shiksha auchity ke aadhaar par hi thi
 Dr
 Kosho Yamamoto writes: 'vah kehete hai ki gaiyr-swayan jo unhone pehle sikhaaya tha wo kuch or nahin balki us paripekshya main auchity bhar he
 

he also told that now he is ready to talk about confidential knowledge
 vyakti sire se ulat vichaaron kaa bhi paalan karata he
 So now he will talk about the positive qualities of nirvana, which is nothing but eternal, joy and pure
 ' According to some scholars, the language used in the Sutras of Tathagatagarbha nature emphasizes Buddhist teaching from dependent origins in positive language, so that people do not turn away from Buddhism and do not understand this teaching as Nihilism
 
 For example, in some sutras full knowledge of non-self is called the true self; The ultimate goal of this path is again explained in a very positive language that has been used in the philosophy of India, but now it has been made part of the new Buddhist vocabulary to explain the person who taught the Buddhist path Successfully completed
 dow yamamoto bataate hai ki nirvana kaa 'sakaaratmak' chithran asal main ek ucch koti ke nirvana se judaa hua he - jise 'mahanirvana' kehete hai
 Talking about the text 'bodhisattva the great divine king' of the Nirvana Sutra, Yamamoto himself resorts to the scripture: 'what is Nirvana? 


 It is like this that a hungry person gets that peace and happiness as if some food has gone in his stomach
 ' Yamamoto continues the quote, adding his own commentary as well: "lekin, aise nirvana ko "mahanirvana" nahin kaha ja saktaa"
 or wo "maha swayan", "maha harsh" or "maha shuddhta" par bhi chintan karte hai jo sabhi sanathan kii tarah hi maha nirvana ke chaar gun hai
 ' kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar, "swayan" kii yahaan or sambandhit sutron main vyakhya asal main paryaapt swayan kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karti he
 Indeed, it is an expression of emptiness in a positive language and indicative of the attainment of enlightenment through Buddhist practices
 is drushtikon main 'tathagatagarbha' / buddha kii shiksha kaa dhyey mukti-shastravaadi he na ki saidhantik
 However, this interpretation is controversial
 sabhi vidwaanon kaa yah mat nahin he
 Writing on the diverse knowledge of the Tathagatarbha doctrine in the Nirvana Sutra and related scriptures, Dr
 Jamie Hubbard says how some scholars find inclination towards the nature of ultimate elementalism and monotheism in the Tathagagarbha
 Dr
 Hubbard's comments: 'matsumoto ki behad sakaaratmak bhashaa or tathagatagarbha shaastra main gyaan ke prerak tareeke main kai samanthaayen hai
 At the same time he showed sufficient monotheism in the Atman / Brahmin tradition
 Apparently, Matsumoto only mentioned this similarity, it is not
 udhaaharan ke liye, takasaki jikido jo tathagatagarbha parampara ke prakand vidwaan maane jate hai, unhone tathagatagarbha or mahayan ke siddhaton main advaitvaad ko dekha


obermiller ne apane anuwaad main advait param siddhant kii dharna ko tathagatagarbha parampara se jodakar dekha or unhone ratnagotra par tippanee kii, jiskaa unhone bade hi sateek tareeke se "buddha advaitvaad kii niyam pustika" ke taur par namakaran kiya
 

lamotte and Frauwolner contrasted the Tathagatagarbha doctrine with the Madhyamika and they associated it with the monotheism of the Atman / Brahman, while some such as Ngao, Seafort Royg and Johnston only voiced their doubts and said that it was at the time of the Vedas
 Corresponds to the later monotheism
 ek or mat jiskaa pratinidhitiv yamaguchi susumu or unke chaatr ogava ichijo karte hai, unhone tathagatagarbha ko vaidic vichaaron ke bina hi samajhane main safalataa pai or unhone use riktata or kaarantv kii buddha parampara main hi paaya jo kisi bhi tarah ke advaitvaad ko sire se nakaarte hai
 Obviously, the questions related to the monotheism or eternal nature of the Tathagatagarbha and Buddhist tradition are complex
 dow habird in shabdon ke saath tathagatagarbha ke siddhanton par apane shodh kaa saar rakhte hai: 'knowledge of the Tathagatagarbha has always been a matter of debate, because he has a very positive positive approach to truth and knowledge, not a description of reality in a negative context, that is, not in terms of what it is lacking or vacancy, but as positive description ' paul williams ke anusaar, atman / brahman vichaar ke advaitvaad main ekarupata samajhaaii ja sakati he
 When Nirvana Sutras put forth their teachings to conquer non-buddhist monks: is samay buddha dharm par hindu prabhaav ke bare main bada rochak lagata he
 But it is very easy to just talk about the effects
 

 ye kehete hue mahaparinirvana sutara khud hi ek prakaar se hindu prabhaav kii baat maanata he, jab wo buddha ko 'swayan' kaa istemaal karte hue gaiyr-buddha saadhuon ko jeetne kii baat karata he
 Nevertheless, it would be wrong to think that the outstanding self-brahmin of Advaita Vedanta influenced Buddhism at this time
 ye kahin bhi spasht nahin he ki swayan jiskaa mahaparinirvana sutara main arth he swayanrahit kii kahin bhi advait brahman se tulana kii ja sakati he or vaise bhi ye tathagatagarbha sutara goud pad, jise hindu advait mat kaa sansthaapak kaha jaataa he, usase bhi purana he
 The sutra also says that the nature of the Buddha is truly voiceless, but on the basis of interaction it is called itself
 isi sutara ke duusare khand main, yah kaha gaya he ki teen tareeke hai, jinase vyakti kuch "paa" saktaa he; purv main paanaa, vartmaan main paanaa or bhavishya main paanaa
 usamen kaha gaya he ki "sabhi main buddha kii prakruti he" kaa aashay he ki sabhi bhavishya main ja kar buddha ban jaaenge

 haalanki, dojan ne saaf kaha he ki buddha kii prakruti kuch sandarbhon main vartmaan main bhi maujuud he yahaan tak ki gaiyr-buddha main bhi: asal main vaastaviktaa ko vartmaan se tulana karnaa ise buddha prakruti se joda gaya, jisamen ghaas, ped, man or sharir sabhi ko shaamil kiya gaya
 To dozan is to see anything or see the nature of Buddha
 jabaki chinul kaa mat he ki ye sharir main soonghney or dekhne kii kshamta kii tarah vidyaman he
 The important Lankavatara Sutra states that all actions are due to the nature of Buddha, the destiny of every karma is the cause and root
 jaisaa ki upar sujhaayaa gaya he japani jine guru dojan ne buddha prakruti kii bilkul alag vyakhya kii he, jisamen 'sampurna swaroop' ko buddha prakruti ke taur par dekha jaataa he or kuch bhi isse alag nahin
 buddha kii prakruti sirf 'buddha hone kii kshamta' bhar nahin he, balki sansar kii har vastu kii prakruti yahi he
 All things are seen as Buddha nature in their impermanence and they are not proof of 'ability' for any Buddha nature
 dow masao abe is samaj par likhte hai: '


 In Dozen's understanding, Buddha nature is not a proof of any ability, it is not a seed that every sensitive person has
 Rather every sensitive person, or say everything, living or dead, is actually Buddha nature
 ye koi kshamta nahin he jo bhavishya main rup dikhaaegi, har vastu kii mul prakruti yahi he
 Dozen thus encompassed almost everything, extending the scope of the idea of buddha nature and 'sentient beings', all those things which are alive, which have intelligence and which are Buddha nature itself
 dow masao abeiski vyakhya karte hai: '


 Dozen has not only expanded the scope of the meaning of Buddha nature, but has also given greater scope to sensitive people
 " busho " main, "sampurna vyaktitv hi buddha kii prakruti he
 "immediately after saying this, he says," i consider the whole person's unit of 'sentient beings' inseparable "


 that is, the Dozen has expanded the scope of Xuzhou, which is traditionally meant only for living or sentient beings Used to now include dead and insensitive objects
 duusare shabdon main, unhone mrit vastuon main jivan dekar asamvedansheel vastuon main bhavanaaen dekar or ant main sabhi main buddha or buddha prakruti dene kii baat kahi he
 '
 jain dharm main iskaa arth he karm ke aakhri bandhan khol dena
 jab ek prabud maanav jaise ki ek arihant yaa tirthankar apane shesh adhatiya karmon / aghaty karm ko nasht kar dete hai is tarah apane sansaarik astitv ko samaapt karte hai, tab is avasthaa ko nirvana kaha jaataa he
 Technically, the renunciation of the body of an Arihant or the death of their body is called nirvana, because they have ended their existence in the world and attained liberation
 moksh yani, mukti ke baad nirvana kii prapti hoti he
 After the attainment of nirvana, an Arihant becomes perfect, a liberated person
 jain dharm main nirvana kaa arth he: Those who believe in Jainism celebrate Diwali as the 24th Tirthankara Mahavir Bhagwan's Nirvana Kalyanak Day
 nirvana diwas ko jainagam main 'nirvana kalyanak diwas ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 According to the Shvetambara belief, Kalpasutra contains detailed information on Mahavira's nirvana
 shwetambar manyata anusaar uttaradhyaan sutara main bataaya gaya he ki kis tarah gautam ne kasee ko, jo parshv ke shishy the, nirvana kaa arth samajhaayaa

 Purvarag, Viraha, Swan's cremation, Swayambara, nal-damayanti-vivah, the couple's first encounter and the Ashtayamacharya and the Khandavagic narrative of Sanyogavilas have been greatly magnified by the poet's narrators and imaginative Vaidyavilas

 magh kavi se bhi adhik sriharsh ne ise kavyabadhak paandityapradarshan ke yoga se bahut badha diya he jisase laghukthanakwala kavy ati vrihat ho gaya he
 Being insensitive in marking the skills of Shringari villas and chiefly Kailas and the luxuries of Rasik Nagars, the poet's philosophical generosity increased poetic place in poetry
 punarukti, chyutsamskruti aadi anek dosha bhi yatra tatra dhunde ja sakate hai
 But even after his stay, the artist's amazing talent has shone in the epic due to his grandeur and sublime, imaginativeness and generosity, pedagogy and euphoria, even when ornamented, there is a spontaneous luxury in his play

 Similarly, the third caught the elephant's foot and said that it is something like a pillar, if someone caught the elephant's ear, he said that it is something like a soup, everyone has their own explanations
 jab sab ek saath aae to bada bavaal machaa
 Everyone had realized the truth but not the absolute truth, a single object has many qualities, but due to their attitude of every person, some of the properties of the object are secondary and some prominently visible
