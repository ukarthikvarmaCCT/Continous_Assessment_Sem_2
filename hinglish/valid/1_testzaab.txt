 Epistasis or predominance is a phenomenon in which the effects of one gene are modified by one or several other genes, sometimes called modifier genes
 jis jin kaa lakshanpraroop abhivyakt hota he use epistatic kaha jaataa he, jabaki jis jin kaa lakshanpraroop parivartit ho jaataa he yaa abhivyakt nahin hota, use hypostatic kaha jaataa he
 Epistatis is the opposite of efficacy, which is an interaction between alleles at the same gene locus
 epistasis kaa adhyayan aksar maatraatmak gundharm loki ) or bahujanik anuvanshiki ke sambandh main kiya jaataa he
 In general, increasing the fitness of one allele depends on several other alleles in a complex way; But, because of the way in which population genetics science developed, evolutionary scientists consider Epistasis an exception to the rules

 Population genetics is still taught in the same manner in the curriculum of some early colleges

 The term epistasis is used extensively in population genetics and is specifically related to the statistical properties of this phenomenon

 Confusion often arises due to different lectures of 'freedom' between different branches of biology

 Examples of genes with epistatic effects on fitness that are closely related to each other are found in supergene and human major tissue analog complex genes

 The study of genetic interactions can reveal gene functions, the nature of mutations, functional redundancy, and protein interactions
 kyonki protein jatil adhikansh jaivik kaaryon ke liye uttaradaayi hai, anuvanshik antarkriya ek shaktishaalee upkaran he
 Epistatic interactions of the two locus can be cooperative or inversely effective

 Negative epistasis and sex are considered to be related to each other
 prayogtmak rup se, is vichaar kaa pareekshan alangik or langik jansankhya ke digital simulation kaa upyog karne main kiya gaya he
 Over time, the sexual population is moving towards negative epistasis, or it may be said that fitness is decreasing by the two interacting alleles
 aisa mana jaataa he ki nakaaratmak epistasis ke kaaran logon main antarkriya hataane vaale utparivartan hote hai, jo prabhavi rup se jansankhya main se hat jate hai
 This does not keep these alleles in the population, thus making the overall population more fit

 For example, see Mech Karthi and Bergman
 In addition, trials that used artificial gene networks found negative epistasis to occur only in more densely interconnected networks, while empirical evidence indicates that natural gene networks are so dense Are not causally linked and theories suggest that selection for robustness favors less complex networks and less densely linked genes

 Almost all the mass of an atom is due to the nucleus, the contribution of electron is almost negligible
 saamanytah nabhik kii pahchaan parmaanu sankhya Z, neutron sankhya n or dravyaman sankhya a se hoti he jahaan a = z + N
 The diameter of the nucleus is of the grade of "fermi"
 inke alaava nabhik ke kai gun hote hai jaise aakaar, akruti, bandhan urja, koniya samveg or arddh-aayu ityadi
 The distribution of protons in the nucleus determines the average diameter of the nucleus, which is in the range 1−10 to 10−15 m

 The kingdom of the demon king Bali was on all three worlds

 Only Baikunthanath Vishnu could tell the solution of this situation, so all the gods along with Brahma reached Lord Narayana
 unki stuti karke unhone bhagwaan vishnu ko apni vipadaa sunai
 Then God said in sweet voice that this is a time of crisis for you
 daityon, asuron evam daanvon kaa abhyutthan ho rahaa he or tum logon kii avnati ho rahi he
 But the crisis period should be spent in a friendly manner
 tum daityon se mitrataa kar lo or ksheer sagar ko math kar usamen se amrit nikaal kar paan kar lo
 With the help of the demons, this work will be done smoothly

 By drinking nectar you will become immortal and you will have the ability to kill the demons

 The leader emerged from Vasuki's eye

 Lord Narayana exerted power demonically in the demons and devoutly in the gods
 vasuki naag ko bhi gahan nidra de kar uske ksht ko har liya
 The god began to hold Vasuki Nag on his face
 is par ulti buddhi vaale daitya, asur, daanavaadi ne sochaa ki vasuki naag ko mukh kii ore se pakadaney main avashya kuch na kuch laabh hoga
 He told the gods that we are not inferior in power to anyone, we will take the place of mouth
 tab devataaon ne vasuki naag ke punch kii ore kaa sthaan le liya
 "the sea churning began and the Mandarachal mountain began to roam on the broad back of the Lord Kachhapa

 All the gods and demons started burning with the flame of that poison and their ears began to fade

 On his prayer, Mahadev ji kept the poison on his palm and drank it but did not let it come down from the gorge

 That is why Mahadev ji is called Neelkanth

 "after consuming the poison by Lord Shankar, the ocean churning started again
 doosraa ratna kamdhenu gaay nikali jise rishiyon ne rakh liya
 Then a high horse came out which was kept by Daityaraja Bali
 uske baad airavat hathi niklaa jise devraj indra ne grahan kiya
 After Airavat, Lord Vishnu kept it out of the sea of kaustubhamani

 These two were kept in heaven

 Laxmi ji got married to Lord Vishnu himself

 Then after one moon, Parijat tree and conch came out and in the end Dhanvantari Vaidya appeared after taking the nectar
 "dhanvantari ke haath se amrit ko daityon ne chin liya or uske liye aapas main hi ladane lage
 The gods did not have the power to curse Durvasa so that they could fight the demons and take that nectar, so they stood frustrated and watched them fight among themselves
 devataaon kii niraashaa ko dekhakar bhagwaan vishnu tatkaal mohini rup dhaaran kar aapas main ladate daityon ke paas ja pahunche
 Seeing that Vishwamohini form, what is the matter of the demons and the Gods, the Brahmins, the devouring Kamdev himself, Lord Shankar too were fascinated and looked at him again and again
 jab daityon ne us navyauvana sundari ko apni ore aate huye dekha tab ve apana sara jhagada bhul kar usee sundari kii ore kamaskt hokar ekatak dekhne lage
 The monster said, "oh beautiful! Who are you? Looks like we are being sarcastic on us only to settle our dispute
 aao shubhage! tumhaara swaagat he
 Make us beautiful and make this nectar with lotus
 " is par vishwamohini rupi vishnu ne kaha, "he devataaon or daanvon! aap donon hi maharishi kashyap ji ke putr hone ke kaaran bhai-bhai ho phir bhi paraspar ladate ho
 i am an arbitrary woman
 budhimaan log aisi stri par kabhi vishwaas nahin karte, phir tum log kaise mujh par vishwaas kar rahe ho? acha yahi he ki swayan sab mil kar amritpan kar lo
 " vishwamohini ke aise niti kushal vachan sun kar un kamandh daityo, daanvon or asuron ko us par or bhi vishwaas ho gaya
 He said, "beautiful! We have full faith in you
 tum jis prakaar baantogi ham usee prakaar amritpan kar lenge
 Take this event and distribute nectar among all of us
 " vishwamohini ne amrit ghat lekar devataaon or daityon ko alag-alag panktiyo main baithne ke liye kaha
 After that, the demons plastered with their sarcasm and began to make nectar to the gods
 daitya unke kataaksh se aise madahosh huye ki amrit pinaa hi bhul gayi
 God considered this trick as a monster named Rahu
 vah devtaa kaa rup bana kar devataaon main jaakar baith gaya or praapt amrit ko mukh main daal liya
 When the nectar reached its gorge, the moon and the sun called out and said that it is Rahu monster
 yah sunakar bhagwaan vishnu ne tatkaal apane sudarshan chakra se uskaa sir gardan se alag kar diya
 Due to the effect of nectar, his head and torso became two planets named Rahu and Ketu and were established in space
 ve hi bair bhav ke kaaran surya or chandramaa kaa grahan karaate hai
 In this way, Lord Vishnu was omitted from there by giving nectar to the gods
 unke lop hote hi daityon kii madhoshi samaapt ho gai
 They became very angry and started attacking the gods

 Chandrabhanu Gupta's political career began in 1926
 He was made a member of Uttar Pradesh Congress and All India Congress Committee
 Chandrabhanu had made his mark in the Congress in a very short time as soon as he entered politics
 He immediately became the Treasurer, Vice President and President of the UP Congress
 In the election of 1937, he was elected a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 Then in the first state government formed in 1946 after independence, he joined Govindballabh Pant's cabinet as Parliamentary Secretary
 He then worked as a minister of several departments from 1948 to 1959
 In 1960, he was made the Chief Minister of UP
 At that time, he was an MLA from Ranikhet South
 Politics had become very complicated when Sampurnanand was the Chief Minister
 Many factions were formed in the Congress
 In such a situation, Sampurnanand was made the Governor of Rajasthan and Chandrabhanu was the Chief Minister of UP
 Meanwhile, Gupta's stature had increased a lot in UP politics
 Becoming the Chief Minister was a landslide victory over all types of opposition
 This created panic among the leaders of the Center
 This was the period when the Congress people started challenging Nehru's power at the Center
 Chandrabhanu was not completely influenced by Nehru's socialism
 So Nehru did not like them
 But in the UP Congress, Chandrabhanu was so angry that the mlas were first bowed down in front of Chandrabhanu, and later in front of Nehru
 Nehru not like this In 1963, k Kamaraj advised Nehru that all Congress chief ministers, except a few people, should be designed
 So that state governments can be re-organized
 It was said that leave the post for a few days
 Have to work for the party
 But in Chandrabhanu's eyes, it was that all this game is happening so that the one whom Nehru does not like, he should leave
 They declined
 But they were convinced that it was a matter of a few days
 You will be made Chief Minister again
 But this did not happen
 Under the Kamaraj plan, Chandrabhanu had to step down on the dictum of ideals
 This was a very Democratic war of dictatorship over democracy
 The elected leader had to step down due to dislike
 Chandrabhanu was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh thrice
 From 1960 to 1963
 But even after leaving the post of Chief Minister, he remained an influence in politics
 a matter of luck
 He again became the Chief Minister after winning the 1967 election
 But this time for only 19 days
 Same luck again
 Farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh broke the Congress and formed his party
 Chandrabhanu's government went
 Charan Singh became Chief Minister
 But they could not run the government
 That government also fell
 And Chandrabhanu Gupta was re-appointed as Chief Minister in a hurry in 1969
 He remained in this position for almost a year
 Then something happened that changed the Congress forever
 The Congress party broke up in 1969
 This was not an internal issue of UP
 This time the breakdown took place at the center level
 In a syndicate group led by Indira Gandhi and Kamaraj
 Everyone thought that Indira would be a puppet in her hands
 But Indira turned out to be the biggest politician
 There was a dispute between the two factions about the President
 Morarji Desai turned out to be a strong opponent of Indira
 Chandrabhanu Gupta went to Morarji Camp
 But this camp lost
 VV Giri became President with the support of Indira
 It was here that the career of most of the leaders of the syndicate got a break
 Chandrabhanu's career ended
 But it's a matter of time Morarji also became Prime Minister
 Chandrabhanu was offered a position in the cabinet
 But Chandrabhanu's health had deteriorated
 It was not appropriate to take the post of minister
 They declined
 He died on 11 March 1980

 According to Skandpuran, Sati, the daughter of King Daksha, was married to Lord Shiva
 treta yug main asuron ke parrast hone ke baad daksh ko sabhi devataaon kaa prajapati chunaa gaya
 He performed a yajna at Kankhal to commemorate it
 unhone, haalanki, bhagwaan shiv ko aamantrit nahin kiya kyonki bhagwaan shiv ne daksh ke prajapati banane kaa virodh kiya tha
 Lord Shiva and Sati saw all the gods passing through Mount Kailash, which is the abode of Lord Shiva and realized that they were not invited
 jab sati ne apane pati ke is apmaan ke bare main suna to ve yajna-sthal par gayi or havan kunda main apni bali de di
 By the time Shiva reached there, she was sacrificed
 bhagwaan shiv ne krodh main aakar tandav kiya or apni jataaon se gana ko choda tathaa use daksh kaa sar kaat kar laane tathaa sabhi devataaon ko maar-peet kar bhagane kaa aadesh diya
 The repentant gods apologized to Lord Shiva and requested him to allow Daksha to complete the yagya
 lekin, daksh kii gardan to pehle hi kaat di gai thi
 Therefore, a sheep's neck was cut off and placed on Daksha's body so that they could complete the yagya
 bhagwaan shiv ne havan kunda se sati ke sharir ko baahar nikaala tathaa shokmagn or krodhit hokar varshon tak ise apane kandhon par dhote vicharan karte rahen
 All the gods gathered to discuss this unusual event because they knew that Lord Shiva in anger could destroy the whole world
 aakhirkaar, yah nirnay liya gaya ki bhagwaan vishnu apane sudarshan chakra kaa upyog karenge
 Without knowing Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu divided Sati's body into 52 pieces with his Sudarshan Chakra
