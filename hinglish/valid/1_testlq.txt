 saanchaa:syangja jila ke gavisein The Kakori incident was a historic incident of looting the treasury of the British government to buy weapons with the intention of waging a fierce war against the British Raj by the revolutionaries of the Indian independence struggle, which took place on 9 August 1925

 The specialty of these pistols was that they could be used as a rifle with another log made of wood behind the butt
 hindustan republican association ke keval das sadasyon ne is puri ghatana ko anjaam diya tha
 Ram Prasad Bismil had planned to loot the treasury of the English government during the meeting in Shahjahanpur in view of the need for immediate arrangement of funds to give impetus to the freedom movement being run by the revolutionaries

 Later the British government prosecuted a total of 40 revolutionaries of his party Hindustan Republican Association for waging an armed war against the emperor, looting the government treasury and killing the passersby, Rajendranath Lahiri, Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Ullah Khan and Thakur Roshan Singh
 The death sentence was pronounced

 After the arrest of both the prominent leaders, the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh as well as the revolutionary members of Bengal came on the shoulders of Ram Prasad 'bismil'
 bismil kaa swabhaav tha ki ve yaa to kisi kaam ko haath main lete na the or yadi ek baar kaam haath main le liya to use puraa kiye bagaiyr chhodte na the
 There was a need for money for the work of the party even earlier, but now that requirement has increased even more

 The British government took this train robbery seriously and under the leadership of CID Inspector Tasadduk Hussain, tasked the task of investigating the fastest police in Scotland

 On inquiring from the dhobis of Shahjahanpur, it was found that the chadar belonged to Banarsilal

 The police also came to know from him that the people of Ram Prasad 'bismil' party from Shahjahanpur had gone out of the city on 9 August 1925 and when did they come back? When intelligence was fully confirmed that Ram Prasad 'bismil', who was the leader of Hindustan democracy union, was not in the city that day, on the night of 26 September 1925, Bismil was arrested along with 40 people from all over India
 Was taken is aitihaasik maamle main 40 vyaktiyon ko bharat bhar se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Their names along with the place of arrest are as follows: faraar krantikariyon main se do ko police ne baad main giraftaar kiya tha

 The Special Magistrate Ainuddin had left no stone unturned to tarnish the image of each revolutionary and collected convincing evidence and witnesses before sending the case to the sessions court so that if there is any appeal from the accused later So do not let any of them leave without punishment

 The case was going on, during this time, the festival of Basant Panchami came

 He told his leader Ram Prasad 'bismil' - "pandit ji! Write a ripping poem for tomorrow, we will all sing it together

 After the sacrifice of Bismil, this creation became the mantra of all revolutionaries
 jitani rachana yahan di ja rahi he ve log utani hi gaate the
 The desire for goodness is now in our heart, to see how much emphasis is on the side! Let the time come and tell you, o hope, what can we tell from now, what is in our heart! It has brought us hopeful of murder, loved ones
 Today the battle is in cooch-e-qatil! o shaheed-mulko-miltat, i am reliant on you, now your courage is discussed in a non-existent journey! Now neither are the next batsmen nor the crowd of desires, only the eraser Now in Dile-'bismil! paanch faraar krantikariyon main ashfak ulla khan ko dilli or shacheendra nath bakshi ko bhagalpur se police ne us samay giraftaar kiya jab kakori-kand ke mukhya mukademe kaa faisla sunaaya ja chukaa tha
 a supplementary case of the Kakori conspiracy was filed in the court of Special Judge JRW Bainet and on 13 July 1927, both of them hanged Ashfaq Ulla Khan and accused Shachindranath Bakshi of life imprisonment, accusing them of conspiring against the government
 She went
 seshan jaj ke faisle ke khilaaf 18 july 1927 ko avadh chif court main apil daayar kii gayi
 Both cases appeared before the Chief Justice of the Chief Court, Sir Louis Schutt and Special Judge Mohammad Raza
 jagatnarayan 'mullah' ko sarkari paksh rakhane kaa kaam saunpa gaya jabaki sajayaftaa krantikariyon kii ore se ke0si0 dutt, jayakarannath mishra va kripashankar hajela ne kramshah rajendranath lahidi, thakur roshan singh va ashfak ulla khan kii pairvi kii
 Ram Prasad 'bismil' made his own defense as he was given a simple lawyer named Laxmishankar Mishra at the government's expense, which he refused to take
 bismil ne chif court ke saamne jab dharapravaah angreji main faisle ke khilaaf bahes kii to sarkari vakil jagatnarayan mullah ji baglein jhaankate najar aaye
 At this, Chief Justice Louis Shirts had to ask Bismil in English - "mr
 Ramprasad! From bhich university you have taken the degree of la?" At this, Bismil had laughed and replied to the Chief Justice - "excuse me sir! a king maker did require an Anne degree
" " The trial of Kakori case was going on in Lucknow
 pandit jagatnarayan mullah sarkari vakil ke saath urdu ke shaayar bhi the
 He used the word "mulajim" instead of "muljiman" for the accused
 phir kya tha pandit ram prasad 'bismil' ne tapaak se un par ye chutili fabti kasi: "mulajim hamako mat kahiye, bada afsos hota he; adaalat ke adab se ham yahan tasharif laae hai
 We turn around with our juridis; That we have also lit lamps in the intestines often
 " unke kehane kaa matlab spashth tha ki mulajim ve nahin, mullah ji hai jo sarkaar se tankhwaah pate hai
 He is a political prisoner, so deal with him
 saath hi yah taakid bhi kii ki ve samudr tak kii lehren apane dussahas se palatney kaa dam rakhte hai; mukademe kii baaji palatnaa koun cheez? itnaa bolne ke baad kiski himmat thi jo unke aage thahartaa
 Mulla ji was left with sweat and he thought good in cutting the trowel
 ve chupchaap pichley daravaaje se khisak liye
 Then he did not cross-examine any other day
 aise hazirajabaab the bismil! The debate on cleanliness by Bismil caused sensation in the government section
 mullah ji ne sarkari vakil kii haisiyat se pairvi karne main anakani kii
 Therefore, the court rejected Bismil's plea for self-advocacy on 18 July 1927
 uske baad unhone 76 prishth kii tarkpurna likhit bahes pesh kii jise dekhakar jajon ne yah shankaa vyakt kii ki yah bahes bismil ne swayan na likhakar kisi vidhivetta se likhvai he
 Ultimately, the same Lakshmishankar Mishra was allowed to argue, which Bismil refused to take
 yah bhi adaalat or sarkari vakil jagatnarayan mullah kii mili bhagat se kiya gaya
 Because if Bismil were allowed to contest the entire case himself, the government would surely lose the case
 22 agast 1927 ko jo faisla sunaaya gaya uske anusaar ram prasad bismil, rajendranath lahidi va ashfak ulla khan ko ai0pi0si0 kii dfa 121 va 120 ke antargat aaajeevan karawas tathaa 302 va 396 ke anusaar phaansi evam thakur roshan singh ko pehali do dfaaon main 5+5 kul 10 varsh kii kadi kaid tathaa agali do dfaaon ke anusaar phaansi kaa hukum hua
 Shachindranath Sanyal, expressing his remorse in writing when he was in jail, had pledged not to take part in any future revolutionary action, on the basis of which his life-term remained intact
 unke chote bhai bhoopendranath sanyaal va banavaari laal ne apana-apana jurm kabool karte hue court kii koi bhi sajaa bhugatne kii andertaking pehle hi de rakhi thi isaliye unhone apil nahin kii or donon ko 5-5 varsh kii sajaa ke aadesh yathaavat rahe
 Despite appeals to the Chief Court, the decorations of Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee, Mukundi Lal and Govindcharan Kar were increased from 10 to 10 years in life imprisonment
 sureshchandra bhattacharya va vishnusharan dublish kii sajaayen bhi 7 varsh se badhaakar 10 varsh kar di gayi
 Ramakrishna Khatri also remained sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment
 khubasurat handriting main likhakar apil dene ke kaaran keval pranavesh chatarji kii sajaa ko 5 varsh se ghataakar 4 varsh kar diya gaya
 Ramnath Pandey was the least punished in this case
 manmathanath gupt, jinaki goli se musafir maaraa gaya, kii sajaa badhaakar 14 varsh kar di gayi
 Another accused Ram Dulare Trivedi was sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment in this case

 Thakur Manjit Singh Rathore proposed to reduce the punishment of all the prisoners of death sentence of Kakori in Central Legislative Council to life imprisonment

 78 members of the Central Council gave a signature memorial to the then Viceroy and Governor General, Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, going to Shimla, which was prominently displayed by Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, NC Kelkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, Govind Vallabh Pant etc
 He had signed, but he had no effect on the Viceroy

 Finally, Barrister Mohan Lal Saxena prepared and sent documents of clemency petition in Privy Council to England's famous lawyer SL Polak, but the judges of London and the legal advisors of the emperor argued that Ram Prasad 'bismil was the architect of this conspiracy
 'if he is granted a pardon, he is a very dangerous and professional criminal, then he will be bigger and more dangerous in future
 Can e
 us sthiti main bartania sarkaar ko hindustan main hukumat karnaa asambhav ho jaayegaa
 Ultimately, the appeal for clemency sent to the Privy Council was also rejected

 hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world
 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language
 in vibhinn bhashaayon ke shabdon ke rup isliye milte-julate the kyonki yah ek hi pracheen jad se utpann hue sajaateey shabd the
 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european

 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below
 hind europea shakhaon ko mukhyatah do virgon main rakhaa jaataa he : kentum varg or saatam varg
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh
 saath hi saath, aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 These include the Baltic, Slavic, indo-iranian, Armenian, and Albanian branches

 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Qu, Gw and Gv were preserved in the same way
 aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 At that time, the indus-valley civilization was destroyed either by earthquakes or by changes in the current of indus-saraswati rivers and due to drought

 The "kurgan tomb-mounds" of Central Asia are believed to have been created by the ancient Aryans

 This view is considered by many Indians and Hindutva-plaintiffs, but in the rest of the world, this view is not valued

 By the way, there are no similar words found in Greek, Latin, German and other indo-european languages for the words of Indian climate and animals, such as peacock, cock, tiger, elephant, mango, banana, peepal, banyan, neem, hot Mausam, ganda, buffalo, rice, etc

 lev trotsaki rus ke marxvaadi krantikari tathaa siddhantkaar, soviet rajaneta tathaa laal sena ke sansthaapak va pratham netaa the
 Trotsky commanded the Red Army, which was victorious in the fierce civil war that followed the Russian Revolution
 ek siddhantkaar ke rup main sthaayee kranti ke siddhanth ke jariye unhone marxvaadi vimarsh main yogadan kiya
 At the same time Trotsky also proposed a rule that the level of development of capitalism is not the same everywhere, which results in the simultaneous occurrence of two phases of social and historical development in backward countries
 beesvin sadi ke pehle dashak main marxvaadiyon ke bich chal rahe bahes-mubahise ke bich trotski kii is saidhantik uplabdhi ne rus jaise audyogic rup se pichde desh main kranti karne ke tark ko majbootee pradaan kii
 After Lenin's death, Trotsky opposed the principle of establishing socialism in a country promoted by Stalin, but he continued to fall alone in the struggle within the party
 pehle unhen party se nikaala gaya, or phir soviet rajya ke viruddh shadyantra karne ke aarope main desh-nikaala de diya gaya
 During the expulsion, Trotsky strongly criticized the Soviet Union being formed under Stalin, calling it a bureaucrat, autocratic and state capitalist state
 soviet sikret police se bachane ke liye sari duniya main bhatakate hue trotski ne 'permanent revolution', 'revolution bitrede' or teen khandon main 'da history of russian revolution' jaise clasik granth kii rachana kii
 In order to bring his dream of world revolution on earth, he also founded the Fourth Communist International, which did not get any special success
 nishkasana ke dauraan hi mexico main stallin ke ek agent ke haathon unhen jaan se haath dhonaa padaa
 Trotsky's followers have formed small communist parties in many countries of the world
 soviet style ke communism ke vikalp ke rup main unke vichaaron ko trotscvaad kii sangya mil chuki he
 Trotsky's real name was Lev Davidovich Bronstein
 bahut kam umr main hi ve marxvad ke prati aakarshith hue or bhumigat raajnneeti karte hue 'trotski' kaa gupt naam apana liya
 His life can be divided into three parts
 pehla hissaa vah he jab roosi marxvad ke ek swatantra hastakshar kii tarah ve krantikari andolan main bhaag lete hue pehle lenin ke najadik aaye or phir unka saath dene se inkaar kar diya
 The second part began from 1917 until 1923 when he pioneered the Soviet Revolution by joining shoulder to shoulder with Lenin
 iske baad unke jivan kaa teesraa daur shuru hua jab unhone kranti ke laabhon kii raksha karne ke liye stalinavaad ke kilaaf abhiyaan chhedaa
 Among Bolshevik leaders, Trotsky was the only one who was not seen as his follower despite being Lenin's main partner
 1903 main roosi saamaajik janavaadee majdoor party jab bolshevikon or menshavikon main vibhajit hui, to trotski ne lenin kaa saath nahin diya
 In the beginning, he condemned Bolshevism by saying that it was not a proletariat but a formula of dictatorship over the proletariat
 us samay unhen shaq tha ki lenin robsprre jaise shadyantrkaari netaa hai jinke kaaran rus kaa samaajawaadee andolan pathbhrasht ho jayega
 At the time Trotsky was of the view that the goal of socialism cannot be achieved by commanding revolution in the hands of a disciplined party of professional revolutionaries doing secret political work
 ve ek adhik loktantric or khule charitra kii party banane ke paksh main the
 In 1905 he emerged as the Soviet leader of St
 Petersburg
 rus kii is pehali soviet ne 1905 kii kranti main pramukh bhoomika kaa nirvaah kiya tha, or trotski ise pramanik loktantr kaa namoona maanate the
 After the revolution failed, the Tsarshi arrested him and sent him to Siberia
 trotski vahaan se bhaag nikle or aglaa dashak unhone europe main bitaayaa
 During this period he remained with the Mensheviks organizationally
 1917 main ve rus laute tab farvari kranti ke kaaran zaarshahi kaa patan ho chukaa tha
 Now he joined the Bolsheviks because he felt that there was a lot of similarity between his and Lenin's ideas
 swayan lenin trotski kii raajnneetik or saidhantik kshamtaaon ke prashansak the
 Trotsky grew in stature in the Bolshevik party
 unhone videshi maamalon ke kamisar ke taur par germanon ke saath shanti- vaarta main bhaag liya
 Trotsky, as a military commissar, played a major role in the formation of the Red Army and led him brilliantly in the Civil War
 in safaltaaon ke kaaran trotski ko lenin ke sambhavit uttaradhikariyon main ek ke rup main dekha jane laga
 Like Lenin, Trotsky had deep faith in the creative abilities of the Russian proletariat
 is vishwaas ke aadhaar main vishwa-poonjeewaad ke adhyayan se nikali unki ek vishesh tarah kii saidhantik samaj thi
 Trotsky was of the view that in order to get rid of its backwardness, no country needs to go through the steps that developed countries have gone through
 in deshon main pichhadepan ke saath-saath agadepan ke lakshan bhi ubharate hai
 Analyzing on the basis of this theory, Trotsky showed that much of Russia is backward and underdeveloped, but it has also been infiltrated by Western influences
 kai jagahon par aarthik utpaadan or sambandhon ke viksit taur-tareeke apanaae jane lage hai
 These moments of industrial development have created a considerable proletariat and a westernized intellectual elite in urban centers
 parinamswaroop raajnneetik pratirodh or sakriyata ke radical rup prachlit ho gayi hai
 Since industrialization is imposed from above, the local capitalist class is weak, but the proletariat is strong
 poonjeewaadi varg loktantric kranti karne se darataa he or apni aakshamata ke kaaran apana aitihaasik daayitv nahin nibhaa paa rahaa he, isliye yah jimmedaari sarvhaara varg ke kandhon par aa gayi he
 Taking the peasants under his leadership, the working class will have to move towards socialism by eradicating feudalism and all its remnants
 trotski ne apane siddhant ko sthaayee kranti qaraar diya
 In 1850, Marx used this position while addressing the General Council of the Communist League
 trotski ke mutabik praaq-poonjeewaadi maansikta vaale kisaan is krantikari prakriya main mazdooron kaa saath bahut dur tak nahin de paayenge
 Their interest will remain till they get the ownership of the land
 kisaanon ke saath banaaya gaya jo morcha kranti ke liye rasta saaf karata he, vahi samaajwaad kii rachana main baadhak sabit hoga
 Therefore, in one country, especially in Russia, the construction of socialism cannot be successful until the revolution takes place in other countries as well
 isliye rus kii kranti ko vishwa-kranti, khaas kar viksit deshon main kranti ke shuruaati charan ke taur par hi dekha janaa chahie
 Interestingly, there seems to be a lot of similarity between these things of Trotsky and many theories propounded by Lenin after World War I
 kuch trotskivaadiyon ne yah aarope bhi lagaaya he ki 1917 kii kranti main lenin dwaara trotski ke hi siddhanton kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 It is another matter that Trotsky himself never said this after accepting Lenin's leadership in 1917
 lenin kii mrityu ke baad stallin ne ek desh main samaajwaad ke nirmaan kii shodhpatr taiyaar kii
 Theorists like Bukharin were also with Stalin in this matter
 par trotski ne chetavanee di ki is siddhanth par amal karne ke nattejey rus ke liye vinaashkari niklenge
 He said that the time has not come for the collectivization of farming
 trotski lenin dwaara sthapit komintern ko soviet videsh niti ke aujaar main simit kar dene ke bhi viruddh the
 He argued that the Soviet Union must follow the path of industrialization and modernization, but these achievements cannot be considered synonymous with socialism
 samaajwaad kaa matlab he, shram kii unchi utpaadakta, uske parinamswaroop behatar jivan-str or apane poonjeewaad ke sarvaadhik viksit roopon jaisaa samaaj
 This can only happen when the proletariat has the reins of the world economy
 trotski kaa kahana tha ki stallin ke tahat jo soviet vyavastha he, use keval sankramanakalin samajha janaa chahie
 At present, it cannot be guaranteed that it will develop into socialism or it will degenerate into some version of capitalism
 trotski maanate the ki rus kii naukarshahi ek naye varg kii shakl leti ja rahi he
 Even though Soviet society has not reached the state of state capitalism, but its condition is like a lesser state of workers
 trotski ke vichaaron kii vishesh baat yah thi ki unamem marxvad ko har samasya kii achook aushadhi ke rup main dekhne kii pravritiyon kaa virodh nihit tha
 Similarly, he was also against pushing various fields of art-literature and knowledge in a particular direction in the name of Marxism
 apane in radical vichaaron ke baavjood ve party kaa bahumat apane paksh main nahin kar sake
 Within the party, he was seen as a leader who could provide charismatic leadership in case of a crisis, but was not interested in dealing with the everyday ups and downs within the party, and his intellectual brilliance i like to be alone
 jab trotski kii ummiido ke mutabik europe main kranti nahin hui, to unhone vishwa-kranti kaa lakshya chhod kar keval ek desh main samaajwaad kaa nirmaan karne main lag jane kii stalineey pariyojna ko iskaa jimmedaar tehraaya
 Trotsky has never believed that the leninist-bolshevik idea of party and politics is at the root of the Stalinist mistakes, which has led to a single state-run state becoming its captive society
 darasal, trotski ne jivan ke tisare daur main nishkasana bhogate hue bhi 1903 se 1914 ke bich kii gayi lenin or bolshevikwaad kii apni kathor aalochanaon ko kabhi nahin doharaaya

 It is not a big deal to have Prakash Jha's name as a veteran director with the film, but it is necessary to speculate on the film's entire character list to make a guess about the film

 The film begins with the Duke of York, Prince Albert, calling his wife and his family "bertie", the second son of King George V, who accompanied his wife Elizabeth to the British Empire in 1925 at Wembley Stadium Talking at the end of the exhibition
 vah haklaate hue bhaashan de rahaa he, is bhaashan ko sun hajaaron darshak pareshaan ho rahe hai
 The Prince undergoes a variety of treatments, but they all fail, in the end he is emboldened
 tabhi vah landan main ek australian bhashaa chikitsak lyonal log ke sampark main aata he
 In their first session, Log requests that they call each other by Christian names, violating royal etiquette
 vah berty ko hemelet ke "tu bi, ore note tu bi" swabhaashan ko padhne ke liye taiyaar kar letaa he, jabaki headphone par mozerat ke da marij of phigaaro ko sunata he
 Logue records the sentences read by Bertie on a gramophone record, telling Bertie that he is stuttering during the entire reading, Bertie is shocked to hear
 tabhi log use recording detaa he
 When King George v addresses the Christmas of 1934, he tells his son about the importance of broadcasting the modern monarchy
 baad main, berty log kii recording ko play karata he or apni khud kii aawaaj main shakespeare ke padya paath ko sunata he
 He goes to Logue, they work together for muscle relaxation and breath control, while Logue investigates the psychological reasons behind his stuttering
 prince apane bachapan ke kuch dabaavon ke bare main bataata he: jaise uske pita kaa uske prati sakht mizaaj hona; uski baayen haath se kaam karne kii pravriti ke kaaran us par tanaav hona; bachapan main uske ghutane kaa ilaaj karne ke liye dardanaak dhaatu upachaar kaa prayog kiya janaa; iske alaava ek naini jo hameshaa uske bade bhai david, prince of wales kaa paksh leti thi, vah jaanboojh kar berty ko pareshaan karata tha, uske mata pita se uski juthi shikaayatein karata tha, jisase vah rone lagata, lekin berty ne bataaya ki uske mata pita uskaa paksh kabhi nahin lete the; or 1919 main uske chote bhai prince jon kii jaldi mrityu ho janaa bhi uske liye tanaav kaa ek kaaran bana
 As the treatment progressed, both of them became friends, also loyal to each other
 20 janvari 1936 ko jorge v kii mrityu ho gayi or david, prince of wales ko king edward VIII ke rup main singhaasana par baithaaya gaya, lekin vah ek america talakshuda samajasevika velis simpasan se shaadi karnaa chahta tha, jisase ek sanvaidhanik sankat paidaa ho gaya
 During a party at Balmoral Castle, Bertie states that Edward cannot marry a divorced woman while on the throne, Albert accuses his brother of medieval-style talking to him to remove him from the throne
 The sarcasm dictates that he pay attention to his language
 berty in aaropon ko sun kar chup rah jaataa he or edward use bachapan kii tarah "bi-bi berty" kahkar chidhaata he
 In the next season, Prince is not able to forget the incident
 use santvanaa dene kii koshish main, log kahata he ki berty bhi raja ban saktaa he or duk ke taj ko uske sar par bhi pahanaaya ja saktaa he
 He can also get this honor
 berty log par rajdroh kaa aarope lagaataa he or gusse main usase kah detaa he ki log apane kaam main safal nahin ho paaya
 Which leads to a rift in their friendship
 jab king edward shaadi karne ke liye apane singhaasana-pad kaa tyaag kar detaa he, berty king jorge VI ban jaataa he
 On this occasion, he is overwhelmed
 saath hi use log kii zarurat mahasoos hoti he
 Both he and the queen go to Logue's house to apologize to her

 This again leads to a confrontation between the king and Logue, Logue making it clear that he has started treating soldiers wounded in the previous war
 jab log saint edward kii kursi par baithta he or trifal ke rup main feken gaye kek ke tukade ko khaarij karata he, smritichihnon ke liye log ke anadaar kii king dwaara kii gai spasht ulaahna use yah ahsaas karaati he ki vah apane pehle bane raajaaon se adhik pratibhavan he
 When the war with Germany is declared in September 1939, George VI calls Logue to Buckingham Pelléas to prepare his radio address for the country
 jab raja or log peles main se hokar chote studio main jate hai, winston churchill king ko bataata he ki vah bhi kabhi haklaata tha, lekin kisi tarah se vah thik ho gaya
 The king narrates his speech to Log, Log coaching him every moment

 It is also clarified that Log and King are friends and that "king George VI makes Lionel Log in 1944 the commander of the Royal Victorian Order
" patakatha lekhak david seedler khud bachapan main haklaata tha, uskaa maananaa tha ki iskaa kaaran dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan uskaa lagane vaala maansik aghat tha
 Because his grandparents were killed in this holocaust
 ek bachche ke rup main seedler ko yah jaan kar prerana mili king jorge VI kii hakalane kii samasya thik ho gayi thi
 "there was a king here who stuttered and had to make radio speeches, everyone would listen to his words and that's why he tried to fix himself with so much passion," commented Seidler
 jab ek vayask ke rup seedler ek lekhak ban gaya, usne king jorge VI ke bare main likhane kaa nishchay kiya
 In the late seventies and into the eighties he made tremendous investigations about King, but he did not get enough information about the log
 aakhirkaar, seedler ne doctor velentine log se sampark kiya jo apane pita ke bare main baat karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 She did not want to give the booklets available to her with the permission of the queen mother

 Most of the varieties of vanilla or planifolia cultivated throughout the world are vanilla beej kii faliyon ko upjane main lagane vaale gahan shram ke kaaran kesar ke baad vanilla doosraa sabase keemtee masala he
 Despite its expense, it is valued for its aroma, which author Frederick Rosengarden Jr
 described in his book The Book of Spices as "pure, spicy and excellent" and its complex floral aroma as a "distinctive bouquet" Is described
 isaki oonchi keemat ke baavjood vanilla kaa prayog vyavsaayik tathaa gharelu donon tarah ke baking, itr nirmaan evam gandh-chikitsa main hota he
 Initially the vanilla cultivators were Totonac people, who lived in the Mazatlan Valley on the Gulf Coast of Mexico, in present-day Veracruz Province
 totonac kii puranic katha ke anusaar rajkumaari janet ko jab uske pita ne ek nashwar ke saath shaadi karne se roka to vah apane premi ke saath jangal main bhaag gai, jiske falswaroop ushnkaribandheey orchid kaa janm hua
 The lovers were caught and their heads were beheaded
 dharti par jahaan kahin bhi unka rakt gira ushnkaribandheey orchid kii lata ug ai
 In the fifteenth century the Aztecs who invaded the central highlands of Mexico conquered the Totonac people and soon tested the flavor of the vanilla pod
 unhone fali kaa naam "tiksochit" yaa “blike flower” rakhaa, kyonki fali ko todane ke baad jald hi yah murjhaa jaati he or iskaa rang kaala ho jaataa he
 After subjugation of the Aztec people, the Totonac people made an appearance by sending beans of Tenctitlan vanilla, the capital of the Aztec
 19veen shadabdi tak mexico, vanilla kaa mukhya utpaadak rahaa
 However, in 1819, French entrepreneurs took vanilla beans to the Reunion Islands and Mauritius, thinking that they would be cultivated there
 Edmund Albius, a 12-year-old slave from Réunion Island, discovered how its flowers could be pollinated quickly by hand, and how the beans began to wilt
 iske baad jald hi ushnkaribandheey orchid ko reunion dweep se comoros dweep tathaa madagascar bheja gaya or saath main unke paragan ke nirdesh bhi bheje gaye
 By 1898, Madagascar, Réunion and Comoros islands produced 200 metric tons of vanilla beans, accounting for 80% of the world's production
 1970 ke dashak ke ant main jab ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ne kheti kii mukhya jameen ko tabah kar daalaa to vanilla kaa bazaar bhav naatakeey tareeke se badha
 1980 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main indonesian vanilla ke bazaar main aane ke baavjood keemton main kami nahin ai
 1930 se vanilla ke vitaran or mulya tay kar rahe gut ko 1980 ke dashak ke madhya main bhang kar diya gaya
 Over the next few years, the price of vanilla was reduced by 70 per cent to US $ 20 per kilogram, but in April 2000, Tropical Cyclone Hooda in Madagascar once again raised prices
 lagaataar tisare saal tak chakravaat, raajnneetik asthirataa or kharaab mausam kii vajah se 2004 main vanilla kii keemten ascharyajanak rup se badhkar 500 america dollar prati kilogram par pahunch gayi, is vajah se nae desh bhi vanilla industry main kadam jamaane lage
 Due to a good crop and the introduction of fake vanilla into the market, demand declined and prices fell to $ 40 per kg in mid-2005
 duniyabar kaa aadha vanilla utpaadan madagascar main hota he
 Mexico was once one of the largest producers of natural vanilla and produced 500 tons a year
 lekin, 2006 main ye ghatakar 10 ton hi rah gaya
 It is estimated that 95 percent of goods sold under the name of "vanilla" products are actually made of synthetic vanillin, which is made from lignin
 pandrahavin shatabdi ke daur main columbus ke pehle vanilla ke bare main kisi ko pataa nahin tha
 When Spanish explorers reached the shores of the Gulf of Mexico in the early sixteenth century, they gave vanilla its current name
 spanish tathaa portugali navik tathaa khojakarta vanilla ko africa or baad main usee shatabdi main asia lekar aae
 They called it vanilla, or "little pod"
 The term vanilla was incorporated into the English language in 1754, when botanist Philip Miller wrote about its ancestry in his book Gardener's Dictionary
 The Latin word vagina originated as vanna and then its altered form vanilla, which describes the way the pod opens and the seeds come out of it
 venillin ke liye upjaai jane vaali pramukh kism he- vanilla planifolya 
 yadhyapi yah mul rup se mexico kii kism he, par ab yah ushnkaribandheey pradesh main vyapak rup se upjaaya jaataa he
 Madagascar is the world's largest producer
 anya sroton main shaamil hai- vanilla pompona tathaa vanilla tahitensis, par in kismon main upasthit venillin kii maatra vanilla planifolya se kaaphi kam hoti he
 Vanilla, climbing on an existing tree, pole or some other support, grows as a creeper
 ise van main, bageeche main yaa kisi "sheder" par ugaaya ja saktaa he, utpaadakta ke badhate hue kram main
 isaki upaj ke vaataavaran ko terrowir kehete hai or isamen sirf aasapaas ke paudhe hi nahin, balki mausam, bhugol tathaa sthaneey bhuvigyaan bhi shaamil he
 Leave it alone, it will grow as much as it can on the support and will feed some flowers
 Every year, growers turn the upper part of the plant downwards so that the plant remains at the same height as any person can stand and reach
 This also greatly promotes the process of flower formation
 vishisht sugandh vaale yogic, fal main paae jate hai, jo phool ke paragan ke parinamswaroop utpann hota he
 a flower gives birth to a fruit
 vanilla planifolya ke phool ubhayalingi hote hai: unamem nar tathaa maadaa ang donon upasthit hote hai; haalanki swa-paragan se bachane ke liye ye ang ek jhilli dwaara alag rahete hai
 Natural pollination of flowers can only occur by a particular Melipone fly, which is found in Mexico
 isi makkhi ke kaaran vanilla utpaadan main us samay se mexico kaa 300 varshon kaa lanbaa ekadhikaar rahaa, jab se isaki pehali baar europiyanon dwaara khoj kii gai tathaa frasisiyon ne apane videshi upniveshon par isaki lataaen ugaayi or tabatak rahi jabatak ki in mackhiyon kaa vikalp nahin dhund liya gaya
 Its vines used to grow outside Mexico, but they do not bear fruit
 Producers took this fly to the yielding places but to no avail
 bagaiyr makkhi ke fal utpaadan kaa ekmaatr tarika he kritrim paragan
 or aaj mexico main bhi haath se kiye jane vaale paragan kaa gahan prayog ho rahaa he
 In 1836 botanist Charles François Antoine was drinking coffee in the courtyard of Maureen Papentla, during which he noticed the black flies that were hovering around the vanilla flowers growing in front of his desk
 unhone mackhiyon kii gatividhiyon ko sameep se dekha kyonki ve phool ke bheetar ek fadafadaahat ke saath utar kar kaary kar rahi thim or is prakiya main makrand kaa sthantaran ho rahaa tha
 Within a few hours the flowers stopped and after several days Maureen found that vanilla beans had started to form
 sheeghra hi marren ne haath dwaara paragan par prayog shuru kar diya
 a few years later in 1841, a 12-year-old boy, Edmund Albius, who was a slave, found in Reunion a simple and effective method of hand-pollination, which is still used today
 ek khetihar majdoor ne bans kii ek dhardaar chhipati dwaara paragakosh tathaa vartikagra ko alag karne vaali jhilli ko hataaya or iske baad anguuthe ke prayog dwaara makrand ko paragakosh se vartikagra par sthanantarit kar diya
 The self-pollinated flower then bore a fruit
 vanilla kaa phool ek din tak jivit rahata he, kabhi-kabhi to isse bhi kam or isliye utpaadakon ko apane bageeche main pratidin khule phulon ko dekhnaa padataa he, jo kaaphi shramyukt kaary he
 The fruit, which is the seed of the seed, is left to remain attached to the plant, which ripen and eventually open; As it dries the phenolic compounds are sterilized, causing the pod to become diamond-shaped, which the French named Givre
 isse tab vanilla kii vishisht sugandh utpann hone lagati he
 The fruit has tiny tasteless seeds
 aise vyanjanon jisamen sampurna prakritik vanilla daalaa jaataa he, unamem ye beej kaale dhabbe jaise dikhte hai
 Like other orchid seeds, vanilla seeds do not germinate without the presence of certain mycorrhizal fungi
 iske badale utpaadak paudhe ko kating dwaara ugaate hai: ve chah yaa adhik patr-ganth vaale lata ke khandon ko hataate hai, jisamen prayek pattee ke sammukh ek jad hoti he
 The bottom two leaves are removed and this area is planted with a support in the soil
 shesh upree jad sahare ke saath lipat jaati he or tab yah praayah mitti main vruddhi karti he
 There is rapid growth in good condition
 french vanilla, vanilla kaa koi prakaar nahin he, balki iskaa prayog praayah us vyanjan-nirmaan main kiya jaataa he, jisamen vanilla kii tej khushboo hoti he tathaa vanilla ke dane maujuud hote hai
 The name originated from the French style of making ice cream custard base with vanilla beans, cream and egg yolk

 vah phir kerala waapas nahin lautaa or magadh main aakar bas gaya
 Scholars who hold such views consider him to be a descendant of the Kutullur Namputri dynasty of Kerala
 kai vidwaanon ne use magadh kaa hi mul nivasee mana he
 Some Buddhist literature describes him as a resident of Taxila
 kautilya ke janmasthan ke sambandh main atyadhik matbhed rahane ke kaaran nishchit rup se yah kahana ki uskaa janm sthaan kahan tha, kathin he, parantu kai sandarbhon ke aadhaar par takshashila ko uskaa janm sthaan maananaa thik hoga
 Vk Subramaniam has said that in many contexts it is mentioned that Alexander had met the young Kautilya in his campaign of attack
 chunki alexander kaa akraman adhiktar takshashila kshetra main hua tha, isliye yah ummid kii jaati he ki kautilya kaa janm sthaan takshashila kshetra main hi rahaa hoga
 Kautilya's father's name was Chanak
 vah ek garib brahman tha or kisi tarah apana guzar-basar karata tha
 Therefore, it is clear that Kautilya's childhood must have gone through poverty and problems
 kautilya kii shiksha-diksha ke sambandh main kahin kuch vishesh zikr nahin miltaa he, parantu uski buddhi kaa prakharata or uski vidwata uske vichaaron se parilakshith hoti he
 Despite being ugly, he was physically strong
 uski pustak 'arthshaastra' ke avlokan se uski pratibha, uske bahuaiami vyaktitv or doordarshita kaa purna abhas hota he
 It is said about Kautilya that he was a man of very self-respect and temper
 ek kinvadanti ke anusaar ek baar magadh ke raja mahanand ne shraadh ke avasar par kautilya ko apamaanit kiya tha
 Kautilya, under the influence of anger, opened his crest and vowed that he would not tie his crest till he destroyed the Nandavansh
 kautilya ke vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh karne kaa yah bhi ek bada kaaran tha
 After the destruction of Nanda Dynasty, he gave all possible help to Chandragupta Maurya to sit on the throne
 chandragupta maury dwaara gaddi par asin hone ke baad use parakramee banane or maury samrajya kaa vistaar karne ke uddeshy se usne vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh kiya
 He also became the minister of Chandragupta Maurya
 kai vidwaanon ne yah kaha he ki kautilya ne kahin bhi apni rachana main mauryvansh yaa apane mantritv ke sambandh main kuch nahin kaha he, parantu adhikansh sroton ne is tathy kii sampushti kii he
 The vigorous king whom Kautilya portrays in 'arthashastra' is certainly addressed to Chandragupta Maurya
 bharat par sikandar ke akraman ke kaaran chote-chote rajyon kii paraajay se abhibhoot hokar kautilya ne vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh karne kaa sankalp kiya
 His paramount desire was to see India as a glorious and vast state
 nishchit rup se chandragupta maury uski ichha kaa kendra bindu tha
 Acharya Kautilya is considered as the founder and patron of the Mauryan Empire on the one hand as a well-known and visionary politician, on the other hand he has the distinction of being the only scholar of his subject due to his incomparable and wonderful work in the history of culture literature
 kautilya kii vidwata, nipunata or doordarshita kaa bakhaan bharat ke shastron, kaavyon tathaa anya granthon main parivyapt he
 The story related to the destruction of the Nanda dynasty by Kautilya and the establishment of the Maurya dynasty comes in the Vishnu Purana
 ati vidwaan or maury samrajya kaa mahaamantri hone ke baavjood kautilya kaa jivan saadagi kaa jivan tha
 He was the true symbol of 'plain Life High Thought'
 usne apane mantritvakaal main atyadhik saadagi kaa jivan bitaayaa
 He used to live in a small house and it is said that the walls of his house were covered with dung cakes
 uski manyata thi ki raja yaa mantri apane charitra or unche aadarshon ke dwaara logon ke saamne ek pratimaan de saktaa he
 He always followed the limits and lived a life of diligence
 kaha jaataa he ki baad main usne mantri pad tyagkar vanprastha jivan vyateet kiya tha
 In fact, he had no desire for money, fame and status
 saratatv main vah ek 'vitaragi', 'tapasvi, karmath or maryaadaaon kaa paalan karanevaala vyakti tha, jiskaa jivan aaj bhi anukaraniya he
 Kautilya is well known as a scholar and a serious thinker, he has also gained fame as a practical and clever politician
 nandavansh ke vinaash tathaa magadh samrajya kii sthapana evam vistaar main uskaa aitihaasik yogadan he
 According to Salatore's statement, Kautilya occupies a paramount place in ancient Indian political thought
 maikiyaveli kii bhanti kautilya ne bhi raajnneeti ko naitikta se pruthak kar ek swatantra shaastra ke rup main adhyayan karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 As it goes kautilya kaa naam, janmatithi or janmasthan teenon hi vivaad ke vishay rahe hai
 There are differences among scholars regarding the name of Kautilya
 kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke pratham anuvadak pandit shaamasasthri ne kautilya naam kaa prayog kiya he
 To prove the authenticity of the name 'kautilya', Pandit Shamashastri has cited vishnu-purana which states- is sambandh main ek vivaad or utpann hua he or vah he kautilya or kautaly kaa
 Ganapathi Shastri has considered 'kautalya' more authentic than 'kautilya'
 unke anusaar kutal gotra hone ke kaaran kautaly naam sahi or sangat prathit hota he
 It has been said under functional ethics - sambashiv shastri ne kaha he ki ganapatishastri ne sambhawatah kautilya ko pracheen sant kutal kaa vanshaj maanakar kautaly naam kaa prayog kiya he, parantu is baat kaa kahin koi pramaan nahin miltaa he ki kautilya sant kutal ke vansh or gotra kaa tha
 The controversy of the names 'kautilya' and 'kautalya' has been raised by many scholars
 ve
 e
 ramasvami ne ganapatishastri ke kathan kaa samarthan kiya he
 Modern scholars have used both names
 paashchaatya vidwaanon ne kautaly or kautilya naam ke vivaad ko adhik mahatva nahin diya he
 According to them, this kind of confusion can be due to the manipulation of the SIC
 adhikansh paashchaatya lekhakon ne kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Scholars in India have used both names, but mostly Kautilya
 is sambandh main radhakant kaa kathan bhi vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 He has said in his composition 'shabdakalpadram' kautilya ke or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 In which the name Chanakya is famous
 kautilya ko chanakya ke naam se pukararane vaale kai vidwaanon kaa mat he ki chaanak kaa putr hone ke kaaran yah chanakya kahalaaya
 On the other hand, according to the legend of some scholars, he was born in Chanak region of Punjab, hence he has been called Chanakya, although no clear evidence is found in this regard
 ek baat spasht he ki kautilya or chanakya ek hi vyakti he
 Apart from the above names, many other names are mentioned, such as Vishnugupta
 kaha jaataa he ki uskaa mul naam vishnugupt hi tha
 His father named him Vishnugupta
 kautilya, chanakya or vishnugupt teenon naamon se sambandhit kai sandarbh milte hai, kintu in teenon naamon ke alaava uske or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, jaise vatsyayan, malang, dravimal, angul, varanak, katyan ityadi in bhinn-bhinn naamon main koun sa sahi naam he or koun-sa galat naam he, yah vivaad kaa vishay he
 But most Western and Indian scholars have used the name Kautilya as the author of 'arthashastra'
 kuch paashchaatya vidwaanon ne kautilya ke astitv par hi prashnvachak chihn laga diya he
 The name Kautilya is symbolic, which is a symbol of diplomacy, according to the opinions of the Victorians, Jolly and Keith
 pantajali dwaara apane mahabhashya main kautilya kaa prasang nahin aane ke kaaran unke maton kaa samarthan mila he
 Jolly has even said that 'arthashastra' is not the work of a person named Kautilya
 yah kisi anya pandit yaa acharya kaa rachit granth he
 Both Shamashastri and Ganapathastri have refuted the views of Western thinkers
 donon kaa yah nishchay mat he ki kautilya kaa purna astitv tha, bhale hi uske naamon main matantar paaya jaataa ho
 In fact, the points raised by these three Western scholars to deny the existence of Kautilya are unrestrained and insignificant
 paashchaatya vidwaanon kaa yah kahana he ki kautilya ne is baat kaa kahin ullekh nahin kiya he ki vah chandragupta maury ke shasankaal main amaatya yaa mantri tha, isliye us 'arthshaastra' kaa lekhan nahin mana ja saktaa he
 This is childish logic
 kautilya ke kai sandarbhon se yah spasht ho chukaa he ki usne chandragupta maury kii sahaayta se nandavansh kaa naash kiya tha or maury samrajya kii sthapana kii thi
 Differences are also found among many scholars regarding Kautilya's works
 kautilya kii kitni kritiyaan hai, is sambandh main koi nishchit soochna uplabdh nahin he
 Kautilya's most important work is the discussion of Arthashastra everywhere, but there is no special mention in relation to other works
 chanakya ke shishy kaamandak ne apane 'nitisar' naamak granth main likhaa he ki vishnugupt chanakya ne apane buddhible se arthshaastra rupi mahodadhi ko mathkar nitishastra rupi amrit nikaala
 Chanakya's 'arthashastra' is a unique treatise on the subject of politics in Sanskrit
 iske niti ke shloke to ghar ghar prachlit hai
 From behind, people compiled many ethics from their policy texts, increasing the number of Vriddhachanakya, Minichanakya, Bodhichanakya etc
 chanakya sab vishyon ke pandit the
 He also has an astrological treatise called ‘vishnugupta Siddhant’
 kehete hai, ayurveda par bhi inkaa likhaa 'vaidyajivan' naam kaa ek granth he
 Justice commentators consider Vatsyayan and Chanakya to be one, but this confusion is the origin of this verse of Hemchand: yon dhaatukautilya or raajnneeti naamak rachanaaon ke saath kautilya kaa naam joda gaya he
 Some scholars believe that in addition to 'arthashastra', if other works of Kautilya are mentioned, it may be a compilation of Kautilya's sayings and statements
 rajya kii utpatti ke sandarbh main kautilya ne spasht rup se kuch nahin kaha kintu kuch sanyogvash kii gai tippaniyon se spasht hota he ki vah rajya ke daivi siddhant ke sthaan par saamaajik samjhaute kaa pakshdhar tha
 Like Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau, he calls the natural condition of the state before its anarchy
 rajya kii utpatti tab hui jab 'matsay nyaay' ke kanoon se tang aakar logon ne manu ko apana raja chunaa tathaa apni krishi upaj kaa chatha bhaag tathaa swarna kaa dasva bhaag use dena sweekaar kiya
 In return, the king took responsibility for their safety and welfare
 kautilya rajtantr kaa pakshdhar he
 Kautilya has discussed seven elements of the state by not giving details of the four essential elements of the state - land, population, government and sovereignty, propounded by Western political thinkers
 is sambandh main vah rajya kii paribhaasha nahin detaa kintu pehle se chale aa rahe saptang siddhant kaa samarthan karata he
 Kautilya has compared the state to the human body and has accepted its form
 rajya ke sabhi tatva maanav sharir ke ango ke samaan paraspar sambandhit, antanirbhar tathaa mil-julkar kaary karte hai- Population includes farmers, entrepreneurs and subjects contributing to economic production
 praja ko swamibhakt, parishramee tathaa raja kii ajna kaa paalan karne vaala hona chahie
 In this way, Kautilya's Weekend Principle highlights the important role of all the organs while representing the invariable form of the state
 yadhyapi yah siddhant rajya kii aadhunik paribhaasha se mail nahin khaataa, kintu kautilya ke rajya main aadhunik rajya ke chaaron tatva vidyaman hai
 District is land and population, amatya is the feeling of government and Swami is the symbol of sovereignty
 kosh kaa mahatva rajprabandh, vikaas va sanvardhan main he tathaa sena aantarik shaanti vyavastha tathaa bahari suraksha ke liye aavashyak he
 Friend plays an important role in foreign affairs, but the fortification has been replaced by other tools of defense and defense in the modern era
 pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik chintan kaa anukaran karte hue kautilya ne bhi rajtantr kii sankalpana ko apane chintan kaa kendra banaaya he
 He considers the power of the king to be paramount in temporal matters, but in matters of duties, he himself is bound in religion
 vah dharm kaa vyaakhyaata nahin, balki rakshak he
 Kautilya, considering the state as practicable in itself, has given it the highest position in social life
 rajya kaa hit sarvopari he jiske liye kai baar vah naitikta ke siddhanto ko bhi pare rakh detaa he
 According to Kautilya, the aim of the state is not just to establish peace and order, but to contribute to the supreme development of the person
 kautilya ke anusaar rajya ke kaary hai- The king's tasks are to protect the state from external enemies and invaders, to protect the internal system of justice and to protect the people from divine calamities - floods, earthquakes, famines, fires, epidemics, deadly animals
 swadharm ke antargat varnashram dharm par bal diya gaya he
 Although Kautilya does not subject the state to religion as Manu like religion, but the king preserves religion if the subjects are not followed by religion
 raja kaa karttavya sarsaadhaaran ke liye saamaajik nyaay kii sthapana karnaa he
 Proper functioning of the social system is possible only when father-son, husband-wife, guru-disciple etc
 fulfill their responsibilities
 vivaah-viched kii sthiti main vah stri-purush ke samaan adhikaron par bal detaa he
 Feminine and Brahmin killing is considered a serious crime
 kautilya ke rajya kaa kaary-kshetra atyant vyapak he
 He entrusts the responsibility of multi-faceted development of human beings to the state and makes it a welfare state of the modern era
 usne rajya ko anek kaary saunpe hai
 Such as construction of dams, ponds and other means of irrigation, development of mines, plowing of wastelands, animal husbandry, forest development etc
 inke alaava saarvajanik manoranjan rajya ke niyantran main tha
 The orphans, the poor, the help of the handicapped, the protection of female dignity, the system of remarriage etc
 were also the responsibility of the state
 is prakaar kautilya kaa rajya sarvavyaapak rajya he
 Its goal is to establish public welfare and good administration, in which religion and morality are used as an instrument
 kautilya kaa kahana he, At another place he wrote
 is sambandh main salattore kaa kathan he, ‘‘jis rajya ke paas satta tathaa adhikaar he, uskaa ekmaatr uddeshy apni praja kii prasannataa main vruddhi karnaa he
 Thus Kautilya has appropriately directed the actions of a welfare state
 ’’ Kautilya has discussed not only the internal work of the state, but also the external functions in detail
 is sambandh main vah videsh niti, anterrashtriya sambandhon tathaa yuddh va shaanti ke niyamon kaa vivechan karata he
 In order to analyze the relationship of diplomacy, he has given the board theory- kautilya ne apane mandal siddhant main vibhinn rajyon dwaara duusare rajyon ke prati apanaai niti kaa varnan kiya
 In ancient times, many small states existed in India
 shaktishaalee raja yuddh dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karte the
 States often compromised in other states in terms of security
 kautilya ke anusaar yuddh va vijay dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karne vaale raja ko apane shatruon kii apekshaakrit mitron kii sankhya badhaani chahie, taaki shatruon par niyantran rakhaa ja sake
 On the other hand, weak states should be vigilant against powerful neighboring states
 unhen samaan str vaale rajyon ke saath milakar shaktishaalee rajyon kii vistaar-niti se bachane hetu ek gut yaa ‘mandal’ bananaa chahie
 Kautilya's Mandal theory shows on the basis of geography how the neighboring countries of the state desiring victory can be its friends or enemies
 is siddhant ke anusaar mandal ke kendra main ek aisa raja hota he, jo anya rajyon ko jeetne kaa icchhuk he, ise ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ kaha jaataa he
 The first state to come in the path of "vijigishu" is "ari" and the state adjoining the enemy is "enemy of enemy", hence he is friend of Vijigishu
 kautilya ne ‘‘madhyam’’ va ‘‘udasin’’ rajyon kaa bhi varnan kiya he, jo samarthy hote hue bhi ranneeti main bhaag nahin lete
 This theory of Kautilya is based on realism, which emphasizes making the balance of power through treaties and agreements, considering wars as the reality of international relations
 kautilya ne videsh sambandhon ke sanchaalan hetu chah prakaar kii nitiyon kaa vivaran diya he- According to Kautilya, these policies should be used by the king only for the welfare of the state
 kautilya ne rajya kii videsh niti ke sandarbh main kootneeti ke chaar siddhanton sam, daam, dand tathaa bhed kaa varnan kiya
 According to Kautilya, the first two principles should be used by weak kings and the last two principles should be used by strong kings, but it is also of the opinion that the value is equal, the price is different and the punishment is better than punishment
 dand kaa prayog antim upaay ke rup main kiya jaae, kyonki isse swayan kii bhi kshati hoti he
 Kautilya has described in detail the types and functions of detectives
 guptchar vidhyaarthee grihapati, tapasvi, vyapaaree tathaa vish -kanyaon ke rup main ho sakate the
 The ambassadors also played the role of undercover
 inkaa kaary desh-videsh kii gupt suchnaayen raja tak pahunchaana hota tha
 They contributed to assess the state of public opinion, control the rebels and destroy the enemy state
 kautilya ne guptcharon ko raja dwaara dhan va maan dekar santusht rakhane kaa suzav diya he
 The thoughts of great men have a great influence in the life of people
 chanakya ke vichaaro ne bhi kai logo ke jivan ko unnat kiya he
 Many books have been written about Chanakya's diplomacy and its principles
 chanakya ke jivan ko padhanevaala or iskaa anusaran karanevaala ek bada varg he
 Chanakya's thoughts are called priceless
 chanakya ke vichaar adhyaaapak, raajnneetijna or vyavsaayik logo ko kaaphi pasand he
 Reading about the glorious personality of Acharya Chanakya brings new energy
 kautilya ke vichaar aaj bhi preranadai banate he
 It is true that Kautilya has described a vast organization of secret systems to protect the nation
 shatrunash ke liye vishakanya, ganika, aupnishadik prayog, abhichaar mantra aadi aniatik evam anuchit upayon kaa vidhaan he or is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye mahaan dhan-vyay tathaa dhan-kshay ko bhi raashtra-niti ke anukool ghoshit kiya he
 Seeing such discussions in 'kautilya Arthashastra', Mudrarakshaskaar poet Vishakhadatta Chanakya has been called untruthful and Banabhatta has condemned 'kautilya Arthashastra' as 'nirguna' and 'atinrushyansprayopadesham'
 'manjushri mulkalp' naam kii ek naveen uplabdh aitihaasik kriti main kautilya ko ‘durmati’, krodhan or ‘paapak’ pukarkar garha kaa paatr pradarshit kiya gaya he
 Many modern Western scholars, who specialize in orientalism, have also compared Kautilya to the famous author and politician Mekiavali of Europe, who, in his book 'the Prince', saw the above unethical systems, taking shelter of all the improper means appropriate to achieve the goal
 Has preached vinternitz aadi paashchaatya vidvan kautilya tathaa mekiyavali main nimnlikhit samanthaayen pradarshit karte hai: It is not rational to show such similarity in Kautilya and Mekiavali
 nissandeh kautilya bhi mekiyavali ke samaan yathartwaadee tha or keval adarshavaad kaa anuyaayi na tha
 But to say that Kautilya had completely abandoned religion or morality would be contrary to the truth
 kautilya ne ‘arthshaastra’ ke pratham adhikaran main hi sthapana kii he; That is, do not let the king subjects be disinherited from their religion
 raja bhi apane dharm kaa aacharan kare
 The king who conducts his religion in this way remains happy in this world and the hereafter
 isi pratham adhikaran main hi raja dwaara amaryaadaaon ko vyavasthit karne par bhi bal diya gaya he or varna tathaa ashram-vyavastha ko sudrudh karne ke liye aadesh diya gaya he
 Here the trilogy and the Vedic rituals have been told the basic basis of protection of the subjects
