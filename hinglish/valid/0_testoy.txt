 The British sent the last Mughal emperor out of the country to Rangoon to eliminate the rebellion for independence
 bahadur shah jafar sirf ek deshbhakt mughal badshaah hi nahin balki urdu ke mashhoor kavi bhi the
 He wrote a number of famous Urdu poems, many of which were lost or destroyed during the upheaval that broke out against the British

 There are very few rulers like Bahadur Shah Zafar who love their country like Mehbooba and succumb to pardes with the promise of not getting a place in ku-i-yaar
 yahi buniyadi farq tha moolbhoot hindustani vichaardhaara ke saath jo apane desh ko apni maan maanate he
 When King Zafar breathed his last while imprisoned in Rangoon, this lion of his own famous ghazal must have been on his lips- "how much is bad luck for Zafar Dawn, two yards of land was not even found in ku-i-yaar 
 " Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor to play an important role in India's first freedom struggle, is also noted as a great poet of Urdu
 unki shaayari bhavuk kavi kii bajaay deshbhakti ke josh se bhari rahati thi or yahi kaaran tha ki unhone angrej shaskaon ko takhte-landan tak hindustan kii shamsheer chalane kii chetavanee di thi
 According to public opinion, when the emperor Zafar was arrested after the first freedom struggle, an English military officer who knew Urdu said this lion while sarcastically saying - "dum dum nahi, now Khair mango ki a jafar is now sheath Is Shamsheer of India 

 !! " On this, Zafar gave a befitting reply and said - "there will be boo in Hindi when the talk of Iman, the planks will go till London

 Shailnath Chaturvedi, former Professor of History at Gorakhpur University, during the time of 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar was such a great personality, who was respected not only as a king but also as a secular person
 isiilie behad swaabhaavik tha ki meerut se vidroh kar jo sainik dilli pahunche unhone sabase pehle bahadur shah jafar ko apana badshaah banaaya
 Chaturvedi said in conversation that making Zafar the emperor was a message to the British rulers symbolically
 iske tahat bhartiya sainik yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki bharat ke kendra dilli main videshi nahin balki bhartiya shaasha kii satta chalegi
 Bahadur Shah Zafar's order to ban cow slaughter after becoming a king was not a new order
 balki akbar ne apane shasankaal main isi tarah kaa aadesh de rakhaa tha
 Zafar had merely started following this order again
 deshprem ke saath-saath jafar ke vyaktitv kaa ek anya pahalu shaayari thi

 Ielamkulam Manakkal Sankaran Namboodiripad was the Chief Minister of the world's first democratically elected Marxist government in Kerala in 1957
 unhone vam dal main loktantric hausale ko jinda rakhaa or us andolan ko prerit kiya jisase kerala bharat kaa pehla purna sakshar rajya ban gaya
 One of the best leaders of the Indian Communist movement, the country's leading Marxist thinker and the creator of modern Kerala, Elamkulam Manakkal Sankaran Namboodiripad's personality was made up of a combination of high-level theoretical skills and activism
 darshan, saundaryashastra, bhashashastra, itihaas, arthshaastra or raajnneeti jaise vividh anushasano main nabbe se zyaada ullekhneey pustakon kaa yogadan karne se lekar aadhi sadi tak communist party kii disha tay karne vaale iemes kaa naam unke jivan main hi desh kii rajdhani se lekar kerala ke kisi bhi maamuli gaanv tak main prasiddh ho chukaa tha
 Due to the 'ekya Kerala' campaign led by him, Kerala was formed on linguistic basis after independence
 ve kerala ke pehle or desh ke pehle gair-congressi mukhyamantri the
 Namboodiripad had a major role in making Kerala the leader of coalition politics
 aaj agar kerala desh kaa sarvaadhik sakshar or jaagruk praant he to iskaa shrey iemes ke kaarykaal main kiye gayi radical bhoomi or shiksha-sudhaaron ko hi jaataa he
 Namboodiripada's autobiography, published in 1968, is considered the best prose of modern Malayalam
 kerala main pragatisheel saahitiyik-saanskrithik andolan kii shuruyaat or vikaas main unki pramukh bhoomika thi
 By deep study of Malayali society and politics, he adopted a dialectical attitude towards caste-problem and designed a special kind of Marxist politics
 parinamswaroop na keval communist party ko kerala ke samaaj main apane kadam jamaane kaa mauka mila, balki puure malayalam samaaj main hi aadhunikeekaran kii prakriya chal nikali
 EMS Namboodiripad was born in Elamkulam village of Perinthalamanna taluk in present-day Mallapuram district
 unke pita parameshwaran bade jameendaar the
 In youth, the reform movement against Namboodiripad caste system was attracted towards the movement
 pragatisheel namboodiri ne yuvak sanghathan 'valluvanadu yogakshem sabha' ke padaadhikari ke rup main jam kar kaam kiya
 In a period when most communist theorists were trying to see Indian history fit into the bookish Marxist mold, Namboodiripad demonstrated the unique originality and analyzed Kerala's social structure as 'caste-born-neduvazhi meritorious'
 apni pehali ullekhneey rachana 'kerala : malayalaikalode mathrubhumi' main iemes ne dikhaaya ki saamaajik sambandhon par unchi jatiyaan haaavee hai, utpaadan sambandh janamaa yani zameendaaron ke haathon main hai or prashasan kii bagdor neduvasiyon yani sthaneey prabhuon ke kabze main he
 This equation was the reason for the poverty and backwardness of most of the public in ems's view
 apane isi vishleshan ko aadhaar bana kar namboodiripad ne 1952 main 'da naishanal queshchan in kerala', 1967 main 'kerala : yasterde, today and tumaaro' or 1984 main 'kerala socity and politics : a historical survey' kii rachana kii
 On the basis of this analysis, EMS also prepared the agenda of the Left to break the nexus of 'caste-born-neduvazhi Medhavitam' in Kerala, which had social reform and anti-caste movement at its center
 iemes ne jor de kar kaha ki jatigat shoshan ne kerala kii namboodiri jaisi sheersh brahman jati tak kaa amanavikaran kar diya he
 He campaigned for the democratization of the Brahmin community by giving the slogan 'make Namboodiri an Insan'
 isi dauraan prachlit rashtravaadi ravaiye se hatate hue iemes ke netritv main communiston ne ek taraf to jati-sudhaar andolanon or savarna virdohi andolan ko samarthan diya or duusari taraf jatigat daayre se pare jate hue vargeey or jan-sanghathan khadey kiye
 In this way, in communist terminology, the land of anti-feudal democratic mass struggles was created
 iemes ne dakshin kerala kii travankor or cochin riyasaton main samantvaad virdohi sangharsh or british shasit ilaakon main samrajyavad virdohi sangharsh kaa sanshray taiyaar kiya
 When the caste-reform movement lost its radical edge and got entangled in narrow bandits, Namboodiripad began to separate the mass movements and the caste movements
 pachaas ke dashak main unhone pichhadi jatiyon kii janata or pichde samudaayon se nikle poonjipati varg ke bich fark karke jabardast bahes ched di jisamen antat unheen ke nishkarshon ko manyata mili
 Disagreeing with the report of the Malabar Tenancy Reform Committee of 1939, EMS gave a fundamental interpretation of the agricultural question in Kerala
 parinamswaroop kaashtakaari sudhaar ke centre main khetihar mazaduron or chote bantidaron ko pramukhataa mili
 Meanwhile, Namboodiripad composed 'A Short History of the Peasant Movement in Kerala'
 1957 se 1971 ke bich chale krishi sudhaaron ke pramukh siddhantkaar ke rup main namboodiripad ko parmparik janami pranali ke khatme kaa shrey jaataa he
 After the land reforms were successful, they also looked at the expansion of market forces
 iskaa nateeja khadi ke deshon se bheji gayi rakam ke kaaran zamin kii keemton main aaye asaadhaaran oochaal kii marxvaadi vyakhya main niklaa

 He became the All India Joint Secretary in 1934 after laying the foundation of the congress-socialist Party in Kerala

 In 1936, he along with four of his colleagues founded the Communist Party in Kerala
 jameendaar parivaar main paidaa hone ke karannamboodiripad ne uttaradhikaar main mili sari sampatti party ko saunp di
 Just before independence, in 1945 Namboodiripad wrote a booklet titled 'A Crore and a Quarter Malayali'
 us samay tak kerala kii janata cochin, travankor or malabar ilaakon main banti hui thi
 This booklet became the basis of 'ekya Keralam'
 1952 main 'da neshnal queshchan in kerala' likh kar namboodiripad ne sari duniya kaa dhyaan apni ore aakarshith kiya
 Through this creation, he presented the democratic claim of Malayali identity in the era of anti-colonial struggle
 1957 main hue kerala vidhaan sabha ke liye pehle aam chunaav main namboodiripad ke netritv main communist party ne jabardast jeet hasil kii
 As the first non-congress Chief Minister of the country, he changed the education system of the state

 In 1959, the central government of Nehru dissolved the government of EMS using Article 356 of the Constitution controversially
 lekin 1967 main saat partiyon ke gathjod ke netaa ke taur par iemes dobaaraa sattarudh hue
 After this, the politics of Kerala became a competition of two alliances led by the Congress and the Communist Party
 pehle mukhyamantri or phir kareeb dedh dashak tak vidhaan sabha main vipaksh ke netaa ke rup main namboodiripad ne gathjod raajnneeti ke vyavhaar or siddhanth kaa shaastra rachaa
 The aspect of developing joint front strategy in Indian parliamentary politics in general and in communist movement in particular will be remembered as his major contribution
 namboodiripad ne vichaardhaaratmak rup se naastik hote hue bhi kerala ke musalmaan or isai samudaayon ke saath jeevant samvaad banaaye rakhane kii parampara daali
 The presence of] in their nexus was its practical culmination

 Baba Saheb Ambedkar made many efforts to improve Hindu religion and Hindu society, to achieve equality and respect, while being under Hindu religion for 10-12 years, but the heart of the upper caste Hindus did not change
 ulte unhen nindit kiya gaya or hindu dharm vinaashak tak kaha gaya
 After that he said that, "we made every effort and satyagraha to achieve the level of equality in Hindu society, but all proved fruitless
 hindu samaaj main samanta ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 "hindu society used to say that" humans are for religion "while Ambedkar believed that" religions are for humans
 " " ambedkar ne kaha ki aise dharm kaa koi matlab nahin jisamen manushyata kaa kuch bhi mulya nahin
 There is no point in living in such a religion which does not allow the followers of their own religion to get religious education, obstructs the job, insults them and even does not get water
 ambedkar ne hindu dharm tyaagane kii ghoshnaa kisi bhi prakaar kii dushmani va hindu dharm ke vinaash ke liye nahin kii thi balki unhone iskaa faisla kuch moulik siddhanton ko lekar kiya jinka hindu dharm main bilkul talmail nahin tha
 On 13 October 1935, while speaking at a conference in Yeola near Nashik, Ambedkar announced his conversion, "haalanki main ek achhut hindu ke rup main paidaa hua hoon, lekin main ek hindu ke rup main haragij nahin marunga!" He also called upon his followers to convert to any religion other than Hinduism
 unhone apni is baat ko bharat bhar main kai saarvajanik sabhaaon main bhi doharaaya

 Ambedkar made a deep study of all the major religions of the world between 21 years after he declared his conversion
 unke dwaara itnaa lanbaa samay lene kaa mukhya kaaran yah bhi tha ki wo chaahate the ki jis samay wo dharm parivartan karen unke saath zyada se zyada unke anuyaayi dharmantaran karen
 Ambedkar loved Buddhism because it has a coordinated form of three principles which is not found in any other religion
 buddha dharm pragna, karunaa or samta kii shiksha detaa he
 He said that man wants these things for auspicious and happy life
