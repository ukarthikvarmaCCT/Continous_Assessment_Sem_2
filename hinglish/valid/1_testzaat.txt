 In such a situation, Gopinath Munde got an open ground, but his shield was broken
 munde pichhadi jati se hai or obisi main unka kaaphi vajan hai
 Munde set out to find his way in national politics
 munde rashtriya upaadhyaksh bane lekin unki jaden maharashtra main hi raheen
 The BJP with Munde's base is not with the BJP
 munde ko aam kaaryakartaaon main kaaphi samarthan tha, jisaki kaat kisi ke paas nahin thi
 He himself went to the Lok Sabha, Pramod Mahajan's daughter got a ticket, so even Munde had to chew gram

 bhartiya janata party rashtriya adhyaksh ne bayaan diya tha ki unki shivasena pramukh bal thakare se sidhe baat nahin ho paati
 Shiv Sena was very angry with this statement
 yahaan tak ki bhartiya janata party shivasena main daraar kii atakalein bhi lagaai jane lagi
 The relationship between the Bharatiya Janata party-shiv Sena alliance still remains in a state of disarray
 bhartiya janata party netaa gopinath munde ne shivasena pramukh bal thakare or sanjay raut se mulaakaat kii
 After the meeting, Gopinath Munde claimed that he had a strong relationship with the Shiv Sena

 Shiv Sena has felt the most relief from Gopinath Munde's announcement of staying in the Bharatiya Janata Party
 agar gopinath munde bhartiya janata party ko ram-ram kar dete to shivasena ko bhi jhatka lagata
 To balance the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, Gopinath Munde has been the chief among the craftsmen of the Shiv sena-bhim Shakti equation

 This is the largest laboratory for the Shiv shakti-bhimashakti equation
 yahi vajah he ki gopinath munde ne ramdaas athawale kii takat ko apane saath milaane ke liye mehnat kii or usamen safal bhi hue
 In such a situation, if Munde left the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Shiv shakti-bhimashakti equation was feared to be ineffective in Marathwada

 As a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee probing India's biggest scam, he raised the voice of Hindi with great vigor and has proved with his aggressive attitude that most people of the country can understand Hindi easily
 tu ji aavanton ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye bani sanyukt sansadeey samiti ke sadsy munde ne is maamle se jude sabhi dastavej hindi main uplabdh karne kii maang kii
 He said that all the members of the committee should be provided documents in Hindi at the right time so that they can prepare to test the witnesses
 Raising the voice of Hindi, Munde also said that if he was not provided papers in Hindi, then he would not attend the committee meeting

 iskaa matlab ye he ki desh ke ek bade tabake ke liye – jisamen ahindi bhashi log bhi shaamil he or saikadon saansad bhi – hindi likhnaa, padhnaa or bolnaa angreji kii tulana main zyada aasaan he
 The boycott of the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee for Hindi was not done by any Hindi-speaking person but a MP from Maharashtra, but surprisingly, this matter of Munde did not appeal to any Hindi newspaper, perhaps that is why someone from Hindi Even the newspaper did not give it a place
 hindi ke akhabaaron ke liye bhale hi ye khabar na ho lekin hindi se anuraag rakhane vaale logon ke liye ye bahut badi khabar he
 So to curse Hindi, those who do evil of Raj Akre should pat Munde's back with more power so that more people can muster up the courage to speak the truth in favor of Hindi

 maharashtra ke up mukhyamantri ke rup main On 13 March 1995, the BJP has been given the privilege of becoming the deputy leader of the alliance and was sworn in as the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra when the government led by Shri Manohar Joshi took over the reins of the state on 14 March, 1995
 Shiv Shahi's For the initial period, he was responsible for more than a dozen departments until the process of the formation of the ministry was completed

 But the most significant achievement is that for a sustained period of 50 months of the coalition government, the achievement achieved by any government in the state since 1973 did not provide a stable and transparent government
 Critics had predicted a downfall of the coalition within a few months, but all political and other crises of the coalition were clearly under the guidance of the stable Shiv Sena Chief Balasaheb Thackeray and BJP leader at the center, Mr
 Pramod Mahajan

 Evolution is the change of genetic traits of a biological population with generations
 jaivik aabaadiyon main genetic parivartan ke kaaran avlokan yogya lakshanon main parivartan hota he
 As genetic diversity varies with generations, natural selection makes those traits more common that provide greater success in survival and reproduction
 prithvi kii umr lagbhag 4
54 arab varsh he
 The oldest undisputed evidence of life is 3
5 billion years old
 ye saboot pashchimi australia main 3

 Older, but conflicting evidence of this life is: 1) 3
7 billion years old graphite found in Greenland, a biogenic substance, and 2) "remains of biotic life" found in 4
1 billion year old stones in Western Australia in 2015
 kram-vikaas jivan kii utpatti ko samajhane kii koshish nahin karata he 
 But evolution explains how today's complex life has evolved from ancient simple life
 aaj kii sabhi jatiyon ke bich samanta dekh kar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki prithvi ke sabhi jeevon kaa ek saajha purvaj he
 This is called the last public ancestor
 aaj kii sabhi jatiyaan kram-vikaas kii prakriya ke dwaara is se utpann hui hai
 All individuals have a genetic material in the form of genes
 sabhi shaks ise apane mata-pita se grahan karte hai or apni santan ko dete hai
 The genes of the offspring vary slightly
 iskaa kaaran utparivartan or langik janan ke dauraan maujuuda jeens main pherbadal he
 Due to this, children are slightly different from parents and each other
 agar wo bhinnataayen upyogi hoti hai to santan ke jivit rahane or prajnan karne kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he
 Because of this, the chances of surviving and breeding different individuals of the next generation are not equal
 falswaroop jo lakshan jeevon ko apni paristhitiyon ke zyada anukulit banaate hai, agali pidiyon main wo zyada saamaanya ho jate hai
 These differences keep increasing gradually
 aaj dekhi jane vaali jeev vividhta ke liye yahi prakriya jimmedaar he
 Most genetic mutations provide no support to individuals, do not alter their appearance nor harm them
 genetic drift ke madhyam se ye nishpaksh genetic utparivartan keval sanyog se aabaadiyon main sthapit ho jate hai or bahut pidiyon tak jivit rahete hai
 In contrast, natural selection is not a random process because it protects the traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction
 prakritik varan or genetic drift jivan ke nity or gatisheel ang hai
 These processes have formed branches of the family tree of life over billions of years
 kram-vikaas kii aadhunik soch 1859 main prakashit charles darwin kii kitaab jeevajatiyon kaa udbhav se shuru hui
 In addition, studies by Gregor Mendel on plants helped to understand genetics
 jeevashmon kii khoj, jansankhya anuvanshiki main pragati or vaigyanik anusandhan ke vaishvik natwork ne kram-vikaas kii kriyavidhi kii or adhik vistrut jaankaree pradaan kii he
 Scientists now have a greater understanding of the origin of new castes and they have now observed the process of speciation in laboratory and nature
 kram-vikaas vah mul vaigyanik siddhant he jise jeevvaigyanik jivan ko samajhane ke liye prayog karte hai
 It is used in many disciplines such as medicine, psychology, bio-conservation, anthropology, forensic science, agriculture and other socio-cultural subjects
 kram-vikaas ke mukhya vichaar sankshep main nimnlikhit hai: Museums of natural history were very popular in the 19th century
 is dauraan europea khojayatraayen or nausena ke abhiyaan bade sangrahalayon ke prakritik vaigyanikon or sangrahadhyakshon ko saath le jate the
 Charles Darwin was a graduate educated and trained in the subject of natural history science
 unke jaise prakritik itihaaskaar sangrahalayon ke liye namoonon ko ikattha karte the, unki soochi banaate the, unka varnan or adhyayan karte the
 Darwin was working as a natural scientist on a ship called HMS Beagle
 unhen duniya bhar kii paanch varsh kii anusandhan yatra kaa kaam saunpa gaya tha
 During his travels he collected samples of many organisms and inspected them
 unhen dakshini america ke taton or nazadiiki gailapagos dweepasmooh ke vividh jeevon main khaas dilchaspee thi
 Darwin gained extensive experience collecting and studying specimens from far off places
 apane in adhyayanon se unhone yah vichaar pesh kiya ki har jati apane jaise lakshanon vaale purvajon se viksit hui he
 In 1938 he explained how this could be a natural process
 unhone is prakritik prakriya ko prakritik varan kaa naam diya
 The size of a population depends on the amount of resources present in its environment
 varshon tak aabaadi kaa aakaar sthir bana rahane ke liye aabaadi ke aakaar or uplabdh sansadhano main santulan bana rahanaa jaruri he
 More offspring are born than the environment the offspring can shelter
 iske kaaran kisi bhi peedi ke sabhi shaks jivit nahin rah sakate hai
 Therefore, there is always a competitive struggle for the resources necessary for survival
 is se darwin ko ehsaas hua kii uttarjivan keval sanyog par nirbhar nahin karata he
 He realized that survival depends on the individual's differences, or "traits"
 kuch lakshan shakson kii uttarjivita main sahaayta karte hai or kuch usamen baadha daalate hai
 The more customized personas of the environment give more children to the next generation than their less adapted rivals
 jo lakshan uttarjivan or prajnan main baadha daalate hai wo kuch pidiyon ke baad lupt ho jate hai
 The traits that help in survival and reproduction accumulate from generation to generation
 is prakaar shakson kii uttarjivan or prajnan kii asmaan kshamta ke kaaran dhire-dhire aabaadiyon main parivartan ho jaataa he
 Observations of differences in animals and plants became the basis of the theory of natural selection
 darwin ne dekha ki orchidon or kiton main ek khaas saajhedaari hoti he jo padpon ke paragan main madad karti he
 He observed that orchids have many structures that attract insects, so that the pollen of the flowers sticks to their bodies
 is prakaar se kit ek nar orchid se ek maadaa orchid tak paraag dhote hai
 Despite the intricate appearance of the orchids, these specialized parts are made from the same basic structures that other flowers form
 apni pustak orchidon kaa nishechan main darwin prastaavit karte hai ki orchid pushp pehle se maujuud pushp bhaagon se prakritik varan kii prakriya ke dwaara parivesh ke zyada anukulit bane hai
 Darwin was still researching and experimenting with his ideas that he received a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace
 is chitthee main vailes ne darwin ke siddhant ke jaise ek siddhant kaa varnan kiya tha
 Due to this both of them jointly published these principles
 vailes or darwin donon jivan ke itihaas ko ek vansh vriksh kii tarah dekhte the, jisamen shakhaon kii nok aaj kii jatiyon ko darshaati he or shakhaon ke vibhajit hone kii jagah ek saajhe purvaj ko
 Darwin said that living things are relatives
 iskaa matlab tha ki sara jivan thode se saral purvajon se utpann hua he
 And it was also likely that all organisms had the same ancestor
 darwin ne prakritik varan dwaara kram-vikaas ke apane siddhant ko 1859 main apni pustak jeevajatiyon kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 His theory means that all organisms, including humans, are the byproduct of continuous natural processes
 iske kaaran kuch dharmik guton ne kram-vikaas ke siddhant par aapatti uthaai he
 In contrast, more than 99 percent of the people in the scientific community support this theory
 aksar prakritik varan ko swasthitam kii uttarjivita kaa paryaay samajha jaataa he, par ye abhivyakti 1864 main prakashit harbart spencer kii pustak jeevigyaan ke siddhant se janmi he, jo darwin kii kitaab ke paanch varsh baad prakashit hui thi
 Survival of the fittest misunderstands the process of natural selection because natural selection is not just about survival and not always the healthiest
 darwin ke prakritik varan ke siddhant ne kram-vikaas ke aadhunik siddhant kii neenv rakhi
 Their research and observations have shown that individuals in a population differ from each other, some of these differences are from parents, and natural selection chooses and discards these differences
 par ve in bhinnataaon kaa kaaran nahin bataa sake
 Like biologists before them they continued to understand that genetic traits were the cause of use or non-use, and that the traits that were ingested over their lifetimes could be passed on to their children
 unhone iske udhaaharan khojane kii koshish kii
 They thought that the legs of large flightless birds like the ostrich would have been overly powerful from generation to generation, and their wings would have been weakened from generation to generation due to less flying
 is galatarahami ko "adhigrahit lakshanon kii anuvaanshikta" kaha jaataa tha jo ki jin baptist lamark dwaara 1809 main prastaavit siddhant "jatiyon kaa parivartan" kaa bhaag thi
 At the end of the 19th century this theory was called Lamarckism
 darwin ne jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshanon kii anuvaanshikta samajhane ke liye pangenesis naam kaa ek asafal siddhant prastaavit kiya
 The experiments of August Weissmann in the 1880s showed that the symptoms acquired during their lifetimes could not be passed on to children
 iske kaaran kuch samay main lamarkwaad ko tyaag diya gaya
 How new traits are given to parents by offspring is answered by Gregor Mendel's pioneering work on genetics
 matar ke paudhon kii kai pidiyon par kiye gaye unke prayogon ne sabit kiya ki mata or pita main sex koshikaon ke gathan ke samay anuvaanshik jaankaree vibhajit ho jaati he or nishechan ke samay mata or pita se mili jaankaree yadrichhik dhang se jud jaati he
 This can be compared to playing cards where an organism gets half its leaves at random from the mother and the other half at random from the father
 mendal ne is jaankaree ko factors kaha, par baad main jin naam zyada prachlit ho gaya
 Genes are the basic unit of genetics
 inamen vah jaankaree hoti he jo jeev ke shaareerik vikaas or vyavhaar ko nirdeshit karti he
 Genes are made of DNA
 diene ek lanbaa anu he jo newcliotide kehalaae jane vaale chote anuon se banataa he
 Genetic information is stored in DNA as a series of nucleotides
 diene kii tulana ek lekh se kii ja sakati he jisamen newcliotide varnon kaa kaam karte hai
 Just as an article composed of a series of characters stores information, DNA composed of a series of nucleotides stores genetic information
 jin diene kii varnmaala ke varnon se bane nirdesh hote hai
 All genes come together like an "instruction manual" which contains all the information about making and functioning an organism
 diene main likhe gaye in nirdeshon kaa utparivartan ke kaaran badalanaa aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata ko badhata he
 DNA is contained in chromosomes inside the capillaries
 nishechan ke samay mata-pita se mili chromosomon ke yadrichhik mishran se santan ko jeenon kaa adwitiya sangyojan miltaa he
 This random mixing of genes during sexual reproduction also increases the genetic variation of the population
 aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata kisi duusari aabaadi ke saath prajnan karne se bhi badhati he
 For this reason, the population may have genes which were not already present in it
 kram-vikaas ek yadrichhik prakriya nahin he
 Although mutations in DNA occur randomly, natural selection is not a random process, the probability of survival and reproduction depends on the environment
 kram-vikaas arabon varshon ke trutipurna pratilipikaran par prakritik varan kaa parinaam he
 The result of evolution is not a well-formed organism
 prakritik varan kaa parinaam apane maujuuda parivesh ke anukulit jeev hote hai
 Progress is not progress towards any ultimate goal
 kram-vikaas zyada viksit, zyada budhimaan yaa zyada jatil jeev banane kaa prayaas nahin karata he
 For example, the flea scorpion is a descendant of a winged creature called a fly, and pythons still have small structures that are remnants of their ancestors' hind legs
 parivesh main teevr parivartan aam taur par adhiktam jatiyon ko vilupt kar detaa he
 More than 99 percent of the castes on the earth have become extinct
 prithvi par jivan kii shruwaat ke baad se paanch pramukh samuhik viluptiyaan ho chuki hai
 Due to these there has been a big and sudden decline in the diversity of castes
 in main sabase tazaa kriteshs-peliosin vilupti ghatana he, jo 6
6 karod varsh purv hui thi
 Genetic drift refers to the change in the frequency of alleles in the populations of a caste
 elil kisi jin ke vibhinn roopantaron ko kehete hai
 They determine hair color, skin color, eye color, blood type etc
 genetic drift aabaadi main nae elil nahin laati he, par ye kisi elil ko aabaadi se hataa kar genetic vividhta ko kam kar sakati he
 Genetic drift occurs by random selection of alleles
 chayan sahi myne main yadrichhik tab hota he jab us par koi bahari bal prabhaav nahin daalata he
 For example, a random selection is to remove some marbles from an opaque bag filled with marbles of different colors at the same measurement and weight
 koi shaks apane elil apane bacchon ko de paaegaa yaa nahin, ye uske jivit rahane par nirbhar karata he jisamen sanyog bhi bhoomika nibhaataa he
 This process of changing the frequency of alleles in the population due to coincidence is called genetic drift
 genetic drift badi aabaadiyon kii tulana main choti aabaadiyon par zyada prabhaav daalati he
 The Hardy – Weinberg rule states that the frequency of alleles will not change over generations in a large population occurring in the Hardy – Weinberg society
 magar ek paryaapt aakaar kii aabaadi kaa is samyavastha main pahunchnaa asambhav he kyonki is samyavastha main pahunchane ke liye ye paanch chijen jaruri hai
 1) The population size should be infinite
 2) utparivartan kii dar shunya pratishat honi chahie, kyonki utparivartan eleelon ko badal saktaa he yaa nae elil bana saktaa he
 3) There should not be migration from or into the population, as individuals coming into or leaving the population can change the frequency of alleles
 4) aabaadi par koi chaynaatmak dabaav nahin hone chahie, arthath kisi shaks ke uttarjivan yaa prajnan kii sambhaavna dusron se zyada nahin honi chahie
 5) The intercourse should be completely random, where all males are equally attractive mates
 yah alilon kii sahi myne main yadrichhik milawat sunishchit karata he
 The population in the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium corresponds to a deck of cards; Regardless of the number of times the deck is thrown, there will be no new leaf and no leaf will come out
 yahan aabaadi main eleelon kii tulana deck ke patton se kii gai he
 Population Bottlenac refers to the rapid decline of a race's population due to environmental events
 ek sahi myne main yadrichhik aabaadi bottlenake kisi elil kaa paksh nahin letaa he; arthath yah yadrichhik hota he ki koun se shaks jivit rahenge
 a bottleneck can reduce or eliminate the genetic diversity of a population
 iske baad kii genetic drift aabaadi kii genetic vividhta ko or kam kar sakati he
 Lack of genetic diversity may place populations at risk of other selective pressures
 aabaadi bottlenake kaa ek udhaaharan "uttari eliphant jalavyaghr" he
 The population of the Northern Elephant Sea was reduced by thirty persons due to the excessive hunting of the 19th
 sangrakshan ke kaaran in kii aabaadi ek lakh se zyada ho gai he or lagaataar bad rahi he
 The effects of bottleneck on the population are clearly visible
 aabaadi main genetic vividhta ke abhaav main in jalavyaghron ko rogon se kaaphi khatra he or anuvanshiki vikaar hone kii bahut sambhaavna he
 The founder's influence occurs when a small group of populations diverge from the rest of the population to form a new population
 aksar iskaa kaaran bhugolic algaav hota he
 The frequency of alleles in this new population is often different from that of the old population
 agali pidiyon kii genetic banaavat sansthaapakon kii genetic banaavat par nirbhar karegi jo puraani aabaadi se alag hogi
 An example of the founder's influence is found in the 1744 Pennsylvania transfusion of the Amish people
 amishon kii pencilvenia kii colony ke do sansthaapakon main elice–vine creveld sanglakshan ke risasive elil the
 Due to the practice of Amish people not marrying outside their community for many generations, the frequency of Ellis-van Kreveld syndrome among them is much higher than the rest of the population

 For 'swara' related to music, see - Swara swar yaa kanthdhvani kii utpatti usee prakaar ke companon se hoti he jis prakaar vaadyayantra se dhwani kii utpatti hoti he
 Therefore, there is some similarity between the composition of the larynx and the instrument
 vaayu ke veg se bajnevaale vaadyayantra ke samakaksh manushya tathaa anya standhari praaniyon main nimnlikhit ang hote hai : 1
 Kamp It also includes vocal cords
 2
 anunadak avyav isamen nimnlikhit ang sammilit hai : 3
 Clarified components - This includes the following organs: swar kii utpatti main uparyukt avyav nimnlikhit prakaar se kaary karte hai : phuffus jab uchhvas kii avasthaa main sankuchit hota he, tab ucchhvsit vaayu vayunalika se hoti hui swaryantr tak pahunchati he, jahaan uske prabhaav se swaryantr main sthir swarrajjuen compit hone lagati hai, jiske falswaroop swar kii utpatti hoti he
 At the same time, the resonator, ie the upper part of the larynx, pharynx, mouth and nasal generates characteristic and softness in the tone through their actions
 iske uparaant ukt swar kaa shabd uccharan ke roopaantar uccharak arthath komal, kathor taalu, jihva, daant tathaa onth karte hai
 With the help of all these, clear pure vowels are generated
 yah peshi tathaa snayujaal se bandhi upaasthiyon ke judane se bani rachana he
 It is an upside down punchy structure that resides at the crest of the trachea in the front of the throat and through which the breath enters and the voice comes out of the throat

 It is the main cartilage of the larynx, which is similar in shape to the spreading wing
 iskaa baahar se ubhaar yuvavastha main, visheshkar purushon main dikhaai detaa he
 Both its wings are on either side of the midline and are spread backwards by making an angle in front of them
 iske upar neeche do shrung hai
 In the upper horns, both sides of the hyoid are connected and both the lower horns meet the cartilage
 donon pankhons ke sandhikon ke urdhv bhaag main kanthchhad kaa moolsthaan he
 Small muscles are covered around all these creations
 yah swaryantr ke neeche kii upasthi he jiskaa aakaar anguthi ke samaan hota he
 It has two parts in which the front portion is thin and round and the back part is broad and wide
 sammukh bhaag ke upar kii ore avatu upasthi kaa nimnabhaag or neeche kii ore shwaasanlee kaa urdhvabhag shleshm jhilli dwaara judaa rahata he
 In the middle line behind the western part is the facing of Annanali
 iske donon ore mansapeshiyaan aachhadit hai
 Similarly, other major cartilages of larynx are the axillary cartilage, rivet cartilage and hornet, which binds to the muscles from all four sides and helps in the origin of the voice
 ye sankhya main chaar hoti hai jo swaryantr ke bheetar saamne se peeche kii ore faili rahati hai
 It is a fibrous structure that also has many positional fibers
 dekhne main ujali tathaa chamakili maaloom hoti he
 In this, both the nerves above are called secondary and below are the main ones
 inke bich main trikon avkaash hota he jisko kanthdwar kehete hai
 Due to the opening and closing of these strands, various types of bizarre vowels are generated
 shwasan kaal main rajjudwar khulaa rahata he or chaudaa tathaa trikonkar hota he
 It becomes somewhat wider in breathing and somewhat narrower in exhalation
 bolte samay rajjuen aakarshith hokar paraspar sannikat aa jaati hai or unka dwaar atyant sankeern ho jaataa he
 The higher the tone, the greater the attraction in the ropes and the more narrow it becomes
 swaryantr kii vruddhi ke saath saath swarrajjuon kii lambaai badhati he jisase yuvavastha main swar baari ho jaataa he
 The vocal cords are longer in males than females
 ucchhvsit vaayu ke veg se jab swar rajjuon kaa kampan hota he tab swar kii utpatti hoti he
 Here only one type of voice is produced, but later on, it changes with the contact of the components of the palate, tongue, teeth and lips
 swarrajjuon ke kampan se utpann swar kaa swaroop nimlikhit teen baton par nirbhar karata he : 1
 Strength - This is according to the height of the vibration waves
 2
 taratv - yah kampan tarangon kii sankhya ke anusaar hota he
 3
 Quality - It varies according to the expansion of resonant locations and depends on the nature of the vibrating waves

 yah ek ugr sthiti he, jis main rogi ko pralaap hota he
 It was first described in 1813
 benjodigepine dalerium tremens ke pralaap ke liye khaas upachaar he
 
 Delerium Tremens was named "D

" It is also digested by name

 or mrityu ho sakate hai, agar thik se chikitsa prabandhit nahin kiya jaataa he
 The withdrawal of other drugs, such as opioids, cocaine and marijuana - which is not a sedative sedative - does not have major medical complications
 is liye, in se nivartan karte vaqt, rogi kii jaan ko dhamkee nahin rahata he sharaab ke kaaran di
 tii
, sharaab ke itihaas vaale vyaktiyon main hi hota he
 For the occurrence of similar syndromes with benzodiazepines, such a continuous and prolonged ingestion period is not required
 sharaab or benzodmauepiness, kaa purv upyog or donon ke ek saath upyog karne se, lakshan or bhi mishrit or khatarnaak ho sakate hai, khaas kar agar upachaar nahin kiya jaataa he
 In the US, less than 50% of alcoholics, while relieved by alcoholism, suffer from withdrawal symptoms
 in main se sirf 5% ithenul se nivartan karte vaqt di
tii
 tak pahonchte he
 Unlike the withdrawal syndrome with opiate addiction, DT can be fatal
 formako-therapy kii unnat or gahan dekhbhaal ke aagaman se pehle, mrityu 35% se zyada rahati thi
 In the era of modern medicine, death falls in the range of 5–15%
 di
tii ke mukhya lakshan bhram, dast, bhatkaav or uttejnaa hai
 And severe autonomic instability may be other symptoms
 Other common symptoms can also be acute perceptual disturbance - such as insects, snakes, or mice

 In contrast to the hallucinations associated with schizophrenia-type dementia, the hallucinations of Delerium tremens are characteristic visual
 lekin yah matibhram kuch rengne kaa sparsh ke saath jude sansani rup membhi ho sakate hai
 Like, as a sensation event in body
 This is called "formicesun"
 kabhi kabhi, di
tii
 haath-pair ke bekaabu, gambhir kampan ke sangh aa saktaa he
 And sometimes, among other symptoms - eg, anxiety, panic attacks and mental mania
 The confusion of the patient is often noticed by the audience, because the patient has trouble making simple sentences or making basic logical calculations

 And should be distinguished among drunken hallucinations

 In the extreme, extreme hyperactivity appears - and fever occurs in 35–60% of patients
 kuch vyaktiyon daura anubhav karte hai
 Delerium tremens is mainly, after a long period of drinking, when a sudden stoppage of alcohol and withdrawal is experienced
 kai logon main - jin main sharaab kii baari istemaal ke ek itihaas hai - sir par chot, sankraman, yaa beemaari se bhi di

 Another reason for this is found in individuals who suddenly stop taking tranquilizer drugs of barbiturate or benzodiazepine classes; Especially those who have 'heavy' addiction with them
 kyonki, in tranquiligers ke praathmik aushadhiy or shaareerik prabhaav, rasayan GABA or shaareerik pranali transmeter ke herpher se hote he; isi liye, sharaab se baari nirbhar vyaktiyon main, antarjaat pranali nayurotransmitter prabhavit ho sakate hai or yah di
tii
ke rup main ubhar aa saktaa he
 These dts and wine - both - have the same form
 yah praathmik kaaran he, ki benzodmauepiness di
tii
 ke liye ek prabhavi upachaar he
 However, ironically, they are, in most cases, the cause of them
 kyonki, ithenul or trankvilliser, donon ke pathmik psycho-aktive rasinic ghatak GABA kaa nakal he
 For this reason, the brain takes them as GABA
 mastishk, dhokhaa kha kar, is ko ek asantulit rasayan pranali samajhataa he
 And stops the production of GABA
 GABA apni shaamak prabhaav ke alaava, ek behad mahatvapurn niamak nayurotransmitter he; jo hriday kii dar ko niyantran, raktchaap or asankhya anya mahatvapurn autonomik tantrika subsyastams niyantran main rakhata he
 Delerium tremens is the most common among individuals with a history of alcohol withdrawal
 khaas karke wo log jo 7 se 8 american pintz bear yaa 1 american pintz dainik pite hai
 Delerium tremens, commonly affected by a history of alcoholism or alcoholism for over 10 years
 ithenul kaa aushadh vigyaan abhi tak puri tarah se samajha nahin gaya he
 However, it is thought that Delerium Tremens occurs when alcohol exerts an effect on the benzodiazepine-gaba a chloride receptor
 lagaataar sharaabi peya mastishk main pratikriya kaa kaaran banataa, jab homeostasis hasil karne kii koshish kiya jaataa he
 By doing so, these receptors have a 'down regulation'
 or, saath hi saath, uttejk neurotransmeter - jaise: norepinephrine, dopamine, epinephrine or serotonin - main ek 'ap reguleshun' hota he - or is se, pine waalon ko sharaab ke sahishnutaa badhaate he
 When alcohol consumption binds, these down-regulated GABA a receptor complexes are produced insensitive to GABA so that the amount of GABA is small; Potentially complicated with the formation is the fact that GABA inhibits the action to bind sympathetic activation - meaning that GABA is not normally there to bind as many receptors
 ise adrenergik "tufaan naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The result of this is - rapid heartbeat rate, high blood pressure, hyperthermia, hypersensitivity, sweating; heart attack, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, anxiety, panic attack, paranoia, and agitation
 " is se bhi badtar yah baat he ki viniman uttejk nayurotransmitter upar he
 So there is sympathetic nerve activity, which GABA cannot resist
 saath main serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, epinephrine or vishesh rup se glutamate bhi adhik hai
 Provocative n
m
 Regulatory stimulus is also given in the receptor; Which increases neuro-toxicity of delirium and withdrawal
 central norepinephrine or iske chayapachayon ke pratyaksh maapan, sharaab ke nivartan syndrome ke gambhirtha ke or pratyaksh ke sambandhit main rahete hai
 It is probable that psychological causes also play a role; In particular, infections, malnutrition, or other underlying medical diseases, which are related to alcoholism
 sharaab se nivartan ke pralaap, benzodmauepiness ke saath ilaaj kiya ja saktaa he
 To prevent mortality, higher doses may be necessary
 pharmaco-therapy rogasuchak or sahaayak he
 Generally, the patient is sedated with benzodiazepines; Such as: diazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide or oxazepam
 or ghambir sthitiyon main, kam se kam str main anti-sychotis yaa midazolam, jab tak lakshan mit na jaye
 puraane dawaaon, jaise paraldehyade or chlomethjole, se upachaar kiya jaataa tha; lekin ab, bade paimaane par, in ko benzodmauepiness adhikraman kar diya he
 However, they are still, under certain circumstances, used as an alternative
 acamproste upachaar badhaane ke liye aksar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 And again, long-term relapse is used to reduce the risk of relapse
 agar sthiti epileptichus maujuud he, akshep ke ilaaj anusaar-yukt kiye jate he
 Controlling environmental stimulants is also helpful
 gambhir rogiyon ke liye, ek sharaab kaa drip nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he, jin se unhen dhire-dhire sharaab se dur liya ja sakate hai
 However, it is rarely used
