 uttejit kshetron praantastha hippocampus or nabhik accumbens he, jo soch or sukh praapt karne ke liye jimmedaar hai shaamil hai
 Another one of alcohol's agreeable effects is body relaxation, possibly caused by neurons transmitting electrical signals in an alpha waves pattern, such waves are observed when the body is relaxed
 sharaab kii laghu avadhi ke prabhaav choton ke jokhim, hinsa or bhrun ko nuksaan shaamil hai
 Alcohol is also associated with lower inhibitions, although it is unclear to what degree this chemical is vs
 studies with placebos can often at least psychologically influence the social effects of alcohol as mimicking moderate doses

 NMDA receptors begin to become unresponsive, slowing down areas of the brain they are responsible for
 This effect contributes to the activity alcohol which induces in the gamma aminobutyric acid system

 Other targets such as sodium channels may also be affected by high doses of alcohol and chronic alcoholics have convulsions to alter the number of these channels that acute alcohol withdrawal may result in as well as being responsible for other effects such as There is a possibility of heart arrhythmia
 Also in chronic NMDA receptor blockade neurons may produce apoptosis which is likely to be one of the factors involved in the production of long-term brain damage seen in alcoholic patients
 anya lakshya he ki sharaab se prabhavit hai cannabinoid, opioid receptors or dopamine shaamil hai, haalanki yah spasht nahin he ki sharaab in sidhe yaa ve GABA / NMDA prabhaavon ke bahaav ke parinaamon se prabhavit hai agar prabhavit karata he

 trikonmiti ganit kii vah shakha he jisamen tribhuj or tribhujon se banane vaale bahubhujon kaa adhyayan hota he
 Trigonometry literally means 'measurement of triangle'
 trikonmiti main sabase adhik mahatvapurn he samakon tribhuj kaa adhyayan
 The main basis of studying the lengths of the sides of triangles and polygons and the angles between two sides is that the ratio of any two sides of a right triangle depends on the value of the angles of that triangle
 trikonmiti kaa jyamiti kii prasiddh boudhayan prameya se gaharaa sambandh he
 The ratios of the lengths of the three sides of a right-angled triangle are called trigonometric ratios
 teen pramukh trikoshmetiya anupaat hai: The remaining three ratios are the inverse of the above ratios: kone sa aadhaar or karn ke bich ke kone kaa maan he
 Trigonometric ratios are used in almost all calculations of trigonometry
 doosraa tarika : trikonmittiya falnon kii paribhaasha kone ke 'saamne kii bhujaa', 'sanlagn bhujaa' evam karn ke anupaaton ke rup main yaad karne se kabhi 'lamb' yaa 'aadhaar' kaa bhram nahin rahata
 Opp below = front arm; adj = attached arm and hyp = hypotenuse boudhayan prameya ke anusaar : karn2 = lamb2 + aadhaar2 Thus for any angle C: sine 2 + cos 2 = 1 boudhayan prameya se yah bhi spasht he ki kisi bhi kone ke liye jya or kojya kaa dhanatmak maan 0 or 1 ke bich hi ho saktaa he
 Note: Aryabhata, the great mathematician of India, presented a table of sine values of twenty-four angles between zero and 90 degrees in the fourth century
 nimnlikhit talika kuch pramukh konon kaa trikoshmetiya maan darshaati he: Put α = β in the above, then jahaan or: bhartiya ganitagyon ne trikonmiti ke kshetra main atyant mahatvapurn yogadan kiya he

 Aryabhata has first introduced the table of sine and versine for an angle from 0 ° to 90 ° at an interval of 3

 ek naveen mat ke anusaar kam se kam madhya pahari bhashaaon kaa udgam shauraseni praakrit he, jo rajasthani kaa mul bhi he
 The phonology of the Pahari languages, sound group, grammar, etc
 have been imprinted on many ethnic levels
 yaksha, kinnar, kiraat, naag, khas, shaq, arya aadi vibhinn jatiyon kii bhashaagat visheshtaayen praytn karne par khoji ja sakati hai jinamein ab yahan arya-aryetar tatv paraspar ghul mil gaye hai
 Historically it is known that in ancient times, some of their different forms were mostly oral
 madhyakaal main yah bhubhag rajasthani bhashaa bhashiyon ke adhik sampark main aayaa or aadhunik kaal main avaagaman kii suvidha ke kaaran hindi bhashaai tatv yahan pravesh karte ja rahe hai
 In a way the behavior of Pahari languages has become limited to domestic colloquialism, correspondence etc
 pahari bhashaaon main darad bhashaaon kii kuch dhvanyatmak visheshtaayen milti hai jaise ghosh mahapraan ke sthaan par aghosh alpapraan dhwani ho janaa
 The name of the western and central hill region was in the ancient times the editorlaksha
 yahan madhyakaal main gurjaron evam anya rajput logon kaa avaagaman hota rahaa jiskaa mukhya kaaran musalamaani akraman tha
 Therefore, in local languages, most of the "n" is targeted instead of "n" and the incipient tendency of non-intransitive words is a sign of Rajasthani influence
 purvi hindi ko bhi ekaadhik pravritiyaan madhya pahari bhashaaon main vidyaman hai kyonki yahan kaa katyur rajvansh suryavanshi ayodhya nareshon se sambandh rakhata tha
 On this basis, the relation of the Pahari languages with the semi-magadhi-kshetra also becomes clear
 inke vartmaan swaroop par vichaar karte hue do tatv mukhyat: saamne aate hai
 One is that they have different characteristics of Pahari languages from Hindi language
 duusare kuch tatv donon ke samaan hai
 Somewhere Hindi words are used alternatively with local words and elsewhere Hindi words are taking the place of local words
 khadi boli ke madhyam se kuch videshi shabd, jaise "hajaamat", "aspataal", "feeta", "sip", "dagdar" aadi bhi chal pade hai
 Three distinctions of Pahari languages can be determined: ise nepali athwa "khaskura" bhi kehete hai
 "gorkhali" is under this
 isamen likhit sahitya paryaapt he
 They are spoken in Kumaon and Garhwal, hence the names "kumaoni" and "garhwali" are famous on this basis
 uttar pradesh ke saat parvaty jile inke kshetra hai or inhen bolanewaalon kii sankhya lagbhag 16 lakh he
 The Kumaoni language is used in the districts of Nainital, Almora and Pithoragarh
 iskaa kshetra is samay lagbhag 8000 vargamil main vistrut he tathaa san 1951 kii janaganana ke anusaar ise bolanewaalon kii sankhya lagbhag 570,008 he
 Hindi is used as a second language
 is kaaran kumaunni hindi khadi boli ke atyadhik nikat aa gai he
 Grammatically, pronouns - I, you, we, you, u, u, are used
 sambandh kaarak bahuvachan kaa rup "unako" na hokar "unar" hota he
 Like in Hindi, only two genders are used in Kumaoni and this sexuality is not only based on the distinction of masculinity, femininity, but also on the size and nature of the object
 vachan do hai, tathaa hindi kii praaia: sabhi dhaatuen milti hai
 Gradation, and syntax are also similar
 aarambh main karta ant main kriyaapad rahata he
 Adverb also comes before the verb like in Hindi
 phir bhi kumaunni main kuch dhvaniyaan khadi boli hindi kii apeksha vishisht hai
 From the point of view of the vowels, the sounds Hrasva "aa", Harsva "A", Harsva "ae", Harsva "O" and Harsva "au" can be seen
 is bhed se shabdaarthon kaa antar ho gaya he
 For example, the word "kawan" means in Kumaoni - the word "kala" and "kava" means "kaal" - meaning death
 vyanjanon main vishesh "na" tathaa vishesh "l" kii uplabdhi hoti he
 Words like "kan", "bhanan" have a distinctive "no" sound which is pronounced towards certain rhythms
 vishesh "l" varna gangoli tathaa kaali kumaun kii boliyon main praapt hoti he
 There are eight dialects of Kumaoni - Khasrajia, Kumayyan, Pachai, Danpuria, Soormali, Sherali, Gangola, Bhotia
 kumaunni bhashaa kii lipi devanagari he
 Its oral literature is very rich, although written literature is also no less important
 gadhwali bhashaa main abhi pracheen tatv kumaunni kii apeksha surakshit hai
 It is practiced in district Garhwal, Tehri, Chamoli and Uttar Kashi
 yah kshetra lagbhag 10,000 vargamil he tathaa gadhwali bhashaa bhashiyon kii sankhya lagbhag 10 lakh
 There are traffic difficulties due to geographical reasons
 isliye pahadiyo ke donon ore rahanewaalon athwa ek hi nadi ke aarpaar rahanewaalon ke bhashaagat prayogon main visheshtaayen ubhar ai hai
 Tibetan in the dialects of the north, and the Kumauni influence towards the east is evident because the boundaries of these areas are mixed
 rajput jatiyon kaa nivas hone ke kaaran gadhwali par najasthani prabhaav to he hi, iske dakshin-pashchim kii ore khadi boli bhi apana prabhaav daalati ja rahi he
 Some characteristics of Garhwali language are visual
 iskaa jhukaav dirghatv kii ore he at: swaron main e, i, o, ou, kii dhvaniyaan, jinka deergh rup pradhan he, adhik prayukt hoti hai
 The tendencies of resonance are relatively low
 kuch aise shabd milte hai jo pracheen bhashaaon se chale aae hai jaise "mukh" ke arth main "gichcho" shabd
 It is possible that many of the received words are remnants of the oldest castes
 vyakaran kii drushti se gadhwali main ek dantagra "l" dhwani pai jaati he jo anyatra kahin nahin milti
 In verb forms, "o" or "ava" is added by omitting the final "a" of the metal, such as running
 lingabhed bhi pray: niyamit nahin
 Much attention is given to the shortness of things, gravity
 anek shabdon ke ekvachan, bahuvachan rup samaan chalate hai
 The characteristics of the idols "L" and "N" in the pronunciation are visual
 sthanbhed se gadhwali kii nau pramukh boliyaan hai - srinagariy, salaani, manjhkumaiyaan, gangavariy, badhaani, rathi, dasauliya, lobhiya or rarvalty
 The main difference seems to be the pronunciation
 gadhwali bhashaa kaa bhi maukhik sahitya mahatv rakhata he
 This is the third distinction of Pahari languages
 vastut: yah anek boliyon kaa samuhik naam he
 These dialects are spoken in Jonsar Bawar, Shimla, north-east-frontier Punjab, Kullu Valley, Chamba etc
 in sabhi boliyon kaa sahitya likhit rup main praapt nahin, is kaaran bhashaa vaigyanik khoj bahut kam ho pai he
 Till now the bids that can be fixed under this, their area is about 14 thousand square miles and the number of ballers is usually 16 lakhs
 inamen mukhya hai - sirmauri, jonsari, kului, champali, andiyaali or bhadravahee, aadi
 Most of the folklore and stories are popular in these dialects
 kului tathaa chambali par idhar kuch kaary hua he
 The region of Kului is, most likely, the area of the ancient Kunind waters that ruled here
 is samay yah boli kullu ghati se lekar himachal pradesh ke mahasu jile tak boli jaati he
 Champali is notable for its melodiousness and due to location differences it also gets "bhatiali", "churahi", etc
 variations
 mandiyaali suket main boli jaati he jabaki badhati solan kii ore
 There is a behavior of Quthali in the foursome of Shimla
 pehle pashchimi pahari kii ye sabhi boliyaan takkari lipi main likhi jaati thim kintu ab devanagari kaa prayog hota he

the next day may see me once more, content as a hog upon ice,far down on the Florida shore, existing on bacon and rice
 i have hobnobbed with peasant and king, with a hundred to run at my call;i have seen the sweet flowers of spring lose their odor and grace before fall
i have loved with the warmth of the boy and adored with the passion of man, But the altar's it's drop of alloy, so i came buck to where i began!chorus
 For the life of a rover is mine etc
 Gillette Burgess, the mischievous American writer and a member of the Bohemian Club, who invented the term "blurb", described this disorganized place named Bohemia as: His faults are more commonly those of self-indulgence, thoughtlessness, vanity and procrastination, and these usually go hand-in-hand with generosity, love and charity; for it is not enough to be one’s self in Bohemia, one must allow others to be themselves, as well
 


 What, then, is it that makes this mystical empire of Bohemia unique, and what is the charm of its mental fairyland? It is this: there are no roads in all Bohemia! One must choose and find one's own path, be one's own self, live one's own life

 Lorraine Stover, author of The Bohemian Manual of Style, divides the word Bohemian into 5 different types of style / ways of living in Bohemian Manifesto: a Field Guide then Living on Da Age
 Strover writes, "bohemian" Species cannot be classified as easily ", because they also carry the process of hybridization and evolution

 According to the authors of the triangle, Christopher Columbus was the first to present some amazing documents about the triangle, which he and his crew saw, "the amazing lights dancing on the horizon", and another location in their log book But he wrote, there were flames in the sky and at another place in his log book he also wrote about the absurd direction of the compass in the area

 The Admiral looked again once or twice, showing him something like the light of a candle that was moving up and down, for some people to think it was a sign of land
 parantu admiral yah nishchit kar chukaa tha ki bhoomi nikat hi thi

 The first article published in newspapers that mentioned the legends of the triangle was Jones on September 16, 1950, via The Associated Press

 "this was the first article to link supernatural events to Flight 19, but in February 1954, another author, Vincent Gaddis, linked Flight 19 to the mysterious disappearance of events in Argosi magazine, and gave it a new interesting name" The Deadly Bermuda Trengle
 " , Based on this article, he wrote a comprehensive book Invisible Horizons the following year

 The trend has been challenged by Lawrence David Kusche, a research library president at Arizona State University and author of Bermuda Trungle Mystery: Salvaged

 He cited cases in which appropriate information was not reported, such as the disappearance of sailor Donald Crowhurst on a world voyage, despite clear evidence of which Berlitz has presented as a mystery
 anya udhaaharan tha ayask-vaahak berlitz kaa atlantic bandargah ke baahar bina kisi nishaan ke teen dinon tak kho jane ke rup main varnan, jab ki yah isi naam se prashanth mahaasaagar ke ek bandargah se baahar kahin kho gaya tha
 Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the events that exacerbated the mysterious influence of the triangle were events that actually took place outside it
 uskaa shodh ascharyajanak tareeke se saral tha: usne us avadhi ke samachar patron main mausam kii khabaron jaisi chijen dekhi jinka in kahanio main kabhi bhi ullekh nahin tha
 Kusche reached a conclusion
 kusche ne nishkarsh diya ki : Marine insurance company Lloyd's of London determined that the triangle was no more dangerous than any other area of the sea and did not charge an unusual charge rate for passing through the region

 Science does not have to answer the questions related to the triangle because those questions are not valid at first sight
 tribhuj me pot or vimaan isi tarah vyavhaar karte hai jaisaa ki ve duniya me anya jagah par karte hai" Skeptical researchers, such as Ernest Teves and Barry Singer, have noted how these mysteries and paranormals are very popular and profitable

 Finally, if it is assumed that the land extends beyond the triangle, such as in Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, or Bermuda itself, then there is no evidence of the disappearance of any land-based vehicles or individuals

 An explanation of the disappearance has focused on the presence of vast areas of methane hydrates on the continental plane in one interpretation

 Nevertheless, there is no specific reason to believe that mischievous waves are more common in the Bermuda region, and this explanation cannot be accepted for the loss of aircraft

 They can be divided into two categories, the action of war and piracy is the record of enemy files for many losses, while many drowning incidents have been linked to enemy raids or submarines during world wars and various orders
 It has been written in log books, many other incidents which came under this category suspiciously, have not been proved; It is suspected that the USS Cyclops in 1918 and the loss of twin boats Protus and Nerus in World War II were also associated with the submarines, but there is no link in German documents

 Other authors relate these events to the UFO

 Charles Berlitz, an eminent linguist and grandson of the author of various additional books on anomalous events, has followed this extraordinary explanation and attributed the losses in the triangle to unexplained or odd forces
 flit 19 ke samaan Flight 19 was a training flight of the TBM war bomber aircraft that went missing over the Atlantic on December 5, 1945

 While the basic facts of this version of the story are essentially accurate, some important details are missing

 On December 28, 1948, an aircraft Douglas DC-3 number 16002, San Juan, disappeared during a flight from Puerto Rico to Miami
 vimaan yaa isame savaar 32 logon kaa koi nishaan nahin mila
 From a document compiled by an investigation by the Civil Aeronautical Board, a possible reason for the plane's disappearance was found, but it was barely noticed by the authors of the triangle; The aircraft's batteries were examined and it was found that their charging was low, but they were ordered by the pilot in San Juan to re-board them without charging
 yah puri tarah se vidyut vifaltaa kaa kaaran tha yaa nahin, yah kabhi maaloom nahin hoga
 However, piston-engine aircraft rely on magnetos in place of a battery-operated ignition coil system to provide spark to their cylinders, so this theory is not very much worth considering

 The remains of the aircraft were found at the molten end of a glacier, indicating that either the crew did not pay attention to their equipment, their equipment failed, or following the major winds from the jetstream en route to Santiago
 When it collided with the top of a mountain, it resulted in a glacier falling into the mountain, in a pile of snow

 One of the more well-known incidents that occurred in the triangle occurred in 1921, then understood as the Japanese ship Raffuku Maru, which sank after conveying the crisis, that "now there is a dagger-like danger come soon!", Or "this is a kind of dagger, come fast!" What the "dagger" was, the writers started speculating as to the possibility of a person with a water blade
 vaastaviktaa main jahaaj tribhuj ke aas paas kahin bhi nahin tha, na hi "dagger" hi sankat ke sandesh kaa ek shabd tha
 Have come soon "), which was sent on April 21, 1925, while leaving Boston for Hamburg, Germany, the ship was engulfed in a terrible storm and sank in the North Atlantic with all the people, while another ship, RAMS Homeric, An unsuccessful attempt to rescue
 26 sitambar, 1955 ko bermuda ke dakshin main atlantic main ek paryaton nauka bahati hui pai gai; kahanio main aamtaur par yah kaha gaya he ki teen aandhiyon ke bich navik laapata ho gaye jabaki jahaaj samudr main batch gaya
 The same storm in the Atlantic weather list of 1955, "edith"; Mentions that came near Bermuda in late August, the second "flora" was far from the east and "katy" came when the boat was recovered
 isaki pushti ho gayi thi ki connemara IV khaali tha or bandargah main tha, jab "edith" ke kaaran naav apane lungar se chhut kar samudr main bah gayi thi
 Apart from the official documents, the popular events of the above mentioned triangle have come from the following works
 yah note kiya janaa chahie ki tribhuj ke bheetar kuch ghatnaon ke ghatit hone kaa jo ullekh he, ve keval in stroton main hi paayi jaati hai

 aadhunik kaara jor-el par aadhaarit supergirl naamak ek comic pustak shrinkhalaa vartmaan main prakaashan main he
 Template: Supergirl nyaay darshan bharat ke chah vaidic darshanon main ek darshan he
 Its promoter is the sage Akshpad Gautama, whose Nyasutra is the most ancient and famous text of this philosophy
 jin sadhano se hamen gyey tattvon kaa gyaan praapt ho jaataa he, unheen sadhano ko ‘nyaay’ kii sangya di gai he
 Devraj defines 'justice' as saying- duusare shabdon main, jisaki sahaayta se kisi siddhanth par pahunchaa ja sake, use nyaay kehete hai
 It is justice to reach a decision based on the evidence
 yah mukhya rup se tarkshastra or gyanamimasaa he
 It is also referred to as Logic, Prostitution, Heterology, Philosophy and Inquisition
 vatsyayan ne pramanarthparikshann nyaayah kaa pareekshan hi nyaay he
 ) From this point of view, when a person establishes a theory in a subject, then the help of justice is required there
 isaliye nyaay-darshan vichaarsheel maanav samaaj kii moulik aavashyaktaa or udbhaavna he
 Without him, no man can refine and maintain his ideas and principles, nor can he protect his theory from the theoretical blows of the opponent
 nyaayashastra ucchkoti ke sanskrit sahitya kaa praveshdwar he
 It is difficult to understand any high Sanskrit literature without its preliminary knowledge, whether it is grammar, poetry, ornament, Ayurveda, scripture or philosophy
 darshan sahitya main to uske bina ek pag bhi chalanaa asambhav he
 Jurisprudence is literally a scripture that makes the intellect excellent, sharp and vivid
 parantu nyaayashastra jitna aavashyak or upyogi he utana hi kathin bhi, visheshtah navyanyay to maano durbodhata ko ekatra karke hi bana he
 Just like the Vaiseshika philosophy, justice is also shown in the judiciary by the knowledge of substances, the accomplishment of disarm
 nyaayadarshan main 16 padaarth maane gayi hai- The history of jurisprudence clearly begins with Gautama's 'nyasutra'
 pracheen granthon main is nyaayashastra ke katipay siddhanton kii charchaa to aaj bhi vishad rup se uplabdh he; parantu us pracheen tarkshastra kaa samyak evam sarvangpurn swaroop kya or kaisaa tha, iskaa sahi gyaan kisi ko nahin he
 It is mentioned in the cases of 'buddhist philosophy' that Buddhists used to represent their views against theistic principles
 isi kaa pratishedh karne hetu nyaayadarshan kii sanrachana hui
 The Buddha's time is believed to be in the sixth century BC
 yahi vah samay tha jab gautam ne nyaayashastra kii rachana kii
 One of the names of the judiciary is logic
 pracheen granth shastron main kinhin-kinhin sthanon main gautam tathaa kahin-kahin akshapaad ko nyaayadarshan kaa rachayita kaha gaya he
 It is mentioned in pages 11-20 under the role of the logic of Acharya Visvesvara
 umesh mishra dwaara rachit 'bhartiya darshan' main kaha gaya he ki tarkshastra baudhon ke pehle bhi tha or vah bada vyapak tha
 It has different ancient names
 yatha - anvikshiki, hetushastra, hetuvidya, tarkshastra, tarkvidya, vadavidya, pramanshastra, vakovakya, takki, vimansi aadi
 It is very difficult to decide when the judicial structure was formed
 kaaran ki vidwaanon ne i
pus
 chhathvin shatabdi se lekar isa purv paanchavi shatabdi ke bich apni manyatayen prastut kii hai; parantu sabake apane-apane paksh tarkyukt hai
 No definite decision can be reached from it
 nyaayashastra ke samgr vichaar do dhaaraon main vibhakt kiye ja sakate hai - prameyapradhan or pramanpradhan
 The ideas of scholarly works from Gautama to the east of Gangesopadhyay are theorem and the ideas of Gangesopadhyay's Tattvachanthamani and the later scholarly works based on it are proof
 prameyapradhan vichaar vaale granthsamooh ko 'pracheen nyaay' tathaa pramanpradhan vichaarwaale granthsamooh ko 'navy nyaay' kaha jaataa he
 The language of ancient justice is simple and material interpretation, and the language of new justice is complex and substance interpretation is subtle
 nyayasutra ke pashchaat kaa jo sahitya uplabdh he, un sabamein vatsyayankrut ‘nyaaybhashya’ kaa pratham sthaan mana jaataa he
 a commentary on the judiciary, called 'judicial', has been written by 'udyotkar', in which the most usefulness of knowing the true nature of the theorems of jurisprudence exists
 inkaa kaal bhi isa kii paanchavin-chhathin shatabdi ke aasapaas hi he
 Even after the publication of the commentary called 'judicial' by Udyotkar did not stop the Buddhist shock on jurisprudence, due to which the eminent commentator Vachaspati Mishra had to write a commentary on the judiciary, which is a very important commentary known as 'judicialism'
 
 vidwaanon ne vachaspati mishra kaa samay isa kii naveen shatabdi maani he
 He purified and scripted this jurisprudence
 isi shuddhta ke kaaran hi aaj yah lekha-jokha uplabdh he ki nyaayadarshan main 5 adhyay tathaa 10 aahnik hai, 84 prakaran evam 528 sutara hai, 196 pad evam 8385 akshar hai
 In Indian philosophy, evidence is called that which helps in knowledge of truth, that is, the means or process by which there is a real knowledge of something else
 pramaan nyaay kaa mukhya vishay he
 The name 'prama' is of true knowledge
 yatharth gyaan kaa jo karan ho arthath jiske dwaara yatharth gyaan ho, use pramaan kehete hai
 These are the four proofs - direct, inference, subhuman and word - in the judiciary
 isamen aitihya, arthapatti, sambhav or abhaav ke pramantv kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 There are two distinctions of direct evidence - external and internal
 ghran, rasna, chakshu tvak or shroatra, in indriyon ko, sharir ke baahar upree bhaag main rahane ke kaaran tathaa bahari vishyon kaa graahak hone ke kaaran "bahya pratyaksh pramaan" or man ko sharir ke bheetar aatma ke saath rahane tathaa bhitari padaarth aatma evam athmiya gunon kaa graha hone ke kaaran "aantar pratyaksh pramaan" kaha jaataa he
 The direct words give sense to the three senses, sensory knowledge and their subject
 ye teen prakaar ke bodh nimnlikhit vyutpattiyon se kramash: utpann hote hai : With the number of direct evidence being six, the number of tajjanya knowledge is six and they are treated with names like idriadvaraka, such as ghrnaj, rasana, chakshu, tvach, shravan and manas, each of these direct knowledge has two distinctions
 - Alternative and optional
 nirviklpak- is pratyaksh main vastu ke swaroop maatr kaa bhaan hota he, uski vishaybhoot, main paraspar sambandh kaa maan nahin hota; atev is pratyaksh kii vishyata visheshantaa visheshyata or sansargata se vilakshan hoti he or vah vilakshan vishyata hi is pratyaksh kaa lakshan he
 It is imperceptible, ie it is not visible
 "saviklpak pratyaksh" ke kaaran rup main iskaa anumaan hota he
 Optional - This is a direct specific recipient
 isaki vishyata visheshantaa-prakaarta, visheshyata or sansargata ke bhed se teen prakaar kii hoti he
 It arises from "nirvikalak" and is directly attuned to the mind
 iske pratyaksh ko "anuvyavsaay" shabd se vyavahrut kiya jaataa he
 There are two distinctions of each of the alternative choices, the cosmic and the supernatural
 loukik - pratyaksh vartmaan or samipsth vastu kaa hi graahak hota he
 He is born from the cosmic contiguity of the senses with the object; They are six times in a row - coincidence, joint isom, joint isom, equal, isom, isom and is special
 inamen sanyog se dravya kaa, sanyuktasmavaay se dravya ke gun, karm or saamaanya kaa, sanyuktasmawet samavaay se gun or karm ke saamaanya kaa, samavaay se shabd kaa, samavet samavaay se shabd ke saamaanya kaa or visheshantaa se samavaay tathaa abhaav kaa pratyaksh hota he
 Supernatural - The supernatural also takes on direct distant and indistinct matter
 uskaa janm vishay ke saath indriya ke alokik sannikarsh se sampann hota he
 The supernatural approximations are three - generalism, knowledge and yoga
 saamanyalakshan - gyatsaamaanya yaa saamanyagyan ko saamanyalakshansannikarsh kaha jaataa he
 This makes it visible to all common types of proximal, remote, existing and non-existent
 yah pratyaksh usee dasha main hota he, jab saamaanya ke kisi aashray ke loukik pratyaksh kii saamagree sannihit rahati he
 Due to the glory of this contiguity, the knowledge of the prevalence of all the waves in all the dhooms is attained only by the associative knowledge of one single wave in a single dhoom and despite the determination of the prevalence of the wave in the adjacent dhoom, there would be suspicion of adultery in the non-destructive dhoom
 is
 gyanalakshan - tattad vishay kaa gyaan hi tattad vishay ke saath indriya kaa "gyanalakshan" sannikarsh kaha jaataa he
 With this contingency, the subject of knowledge is directly visible, not its shelter
 isi ke prabhaav se ek padaarth main anya padaarth ke dharm kaa bhramaatmak pratyaksh hota he
 Yogaj - a specific religion arises in the soul of man through yoga practice
 is dharm ko hi vishay ke saath indriya kaa yogaj sannikarsh kaha jaataa he
 This increases the power of the senses, as a result of which the senses are able to direct even remote and non-matter
 uske prabhaav se hi yogi ko sarvegyata kii prapti hoti he
 Continuous Direct - In this context, it is worth noting that in addition to the above mentioned personal directions, there is also a continuous, which is unborn and imperishable
 vah pratyaksh samgr sansar ko vishay karata he or upadanpratyaksh ke rup main sabhi kaaryon kaa kaaran hota he
 He remains united in the only God
 anumaan pramaan se un sabhi padaarthon kaa gyaan kiya jaataa he jo indriya dwaara gyaat hone kii yogyata rakhte hue bhi duurastha yaa avidhyman hone ke kaaran indriya se gyaat nahin hete athwa jisamen indriya se gyaat hone kii yogyata hi nahin hoti
 It has two distinctions - self-prediction and anticipation
 jis anumaan se apane sanshay kaa niraakaran yaa apane aap ko saadhy kaa nishchay hota he, use "swaarthanumaan" tathaa jis anumaan se anya vyakti - jigyaasu, prativaadee yaa madhyasth - ke sanshay kaa niraakaran yaa saadhy kaa nishchay hota he, use "pararthanumaan" kaha jaataa he
 The conclusion of the "self-prediction" is gained by knowing the prevalence of the objective in its own effort rather than the other man's word, and the "prediction" is derived from the word of the other man, ie, by the use of quasi-judicial justice
 is
 isiilie gangashopadhyaay ne tatvachintamani ke avyavprakaran main spasht kaha he- Justice - Its definition is given in the beginning
 nyaayashastra main iske paanch avyav maane gaye hai - pratigya, hetu, udhaaharan, upanay or giman
 The sentence with which the party has knowledge of the relationship with the practicable is called "pledge", the sentence which is aware of the meaning of the substantive in the subject, "for", the sentence from which the prevalence of the substantive is to be given as "example", the sentence from which In relation to the explanation for the argument in favor, it should be annihilated in relation to the meaning of the object in favor of "upay" and the sentence for which, showing the unobjectionable and unattractive
 Is called "incorporation"
 unke udhaaharan kram main is prakaar hai : Vatsyayan has called this Panchavayavakya sentence "ultimate justice"
 hetu, vyaptigyaan yaa vyapti gyanasahakrut man ko anumaan kah jaataa he
 Of these, the third party is very less famous but the first two sides are more famous
 udaynacharya tathaa unke anuyaayi "hetu" ko or gangashopadhyaay tathaa unke anuyaayi vyaptigyaan ko anumaan kehete hai
 In justice philosophy, three distinctions of presumption are given - antecedent, Seshavat and generalist
 vatsyayan ne in anumaanon kii nimnlikhit rup se do prakaar kii vyakhyaayein kii hai : 1
 Ante = = two objects together in a shelter, such as - Dhoom seen directly in the kitchen, and the estimate of the other being with the east, the estimate of the mountain movement in the atmosphere 2
 sheshwat = prasakt kaa pratishedh or anyatra prasakti ke abhaav se jaise- bhavatmak hone ke kaaran dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya shesh bachnewale padaarth kaa anumaan
 Prohibition of inflexion in karma and absence of affective word in the absence of affections of the word caste in particular and samayva, being in the normal, special and samyavah, being congregated in a mass in general and admiration
 Estimation of the word's inflexion in the remaining escapes attribute
 3
 saamanyatodrusht = jin do padaarthon main vyapyavyapak bhav sambandh jaise- ichha aadi gun or aatma kaa paraspar sambandh pratyaksh vidit na ho, kintu pratyaksh vidit sambandh jab pratyakshvidit nahin he, kintu saamaanya rup se vaale padaarthon kaa saamaanya saadrishy ho, unamem gun or dravya kaa sambandh pratyakshvidit he, ichha ek duusare kaa anumaan aadi main gun kaa evam aatma main dravyatv rup se anya dravya kaa saadrishy hone ke kaaran ichha aadi gunon se unke aashray rup main aatmaswaroop dravya kaa anumaan
 In the above three estimates, there are three distinctions of each - "kevalavayati", "kevalavityareki" and Anavayavittireki
 in bhedon kaa aadhaar raghunatha shiromani ne saadhy ko, udayanacharya ne vyaptigraahak sahachaar ko or gangashopadhyaay ne vyapti ko mana he
 Raghunath implies that the proviso that does not have an opposition is estimated to be a "justly committed" conjecture, such as the conjecture of universal religions such as speech, knowledge, etc
; And the proviso that is not evident is called the "only individual" estimate, such as the estimate of the separation of the earth from the smell; And the approximation of the proviso, which has both the opposite and the opposition, is called the "anvayavityereki" conjecture, such as the conjecture of the revolution
 udaynacharya kaa aashay yah he ki "anvayasahachaar" = hetu main saadhy kaa sahachaar or "vyatireksahachaar" = saadhyabhaav main hetvbhaav kaa sahachaar, in donon sahachaaron se anvayavyapti kaa hi gyaan hota he or usee se anumiti hoti he, at: jis anumiti ke utpaadak vyaptigyaan kaa udai keval anvayasahachaar ke gyaan se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "kevalanwai" anumaan, evam jis anumiti ke utpaadak vyaptigyaan kaa janm keval vyatireksahachaar se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "keval vyatireki" tathaa jis anumiti ke utpaadak vyaptigyaan kaa udai anvayasahachaar or vyatirek sahachaar donon ke gyaan se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "anvayavyatireki" anumaan kaha jaataa he
 Gangeshopadhyay implies that permission does not originate only from inquisitorial knowledge, but also from heteronomy, so the permission of the permission which is born only by inquisition is "only", and the permission of which permissibility is born only of intertextuality
 Knowledge is the reason for the permission "only" and the permission of birth is both unknown and perverse
 The reason for this permission is due to the knowledge of occupants is called "anvayavitireki" inference
 jis padaarth main saadhy kii vyapti or pakshadharmata ke gyaan se anumiti kii utpatti hoti he use "hetu" yaa ling kaha jaataa he
 He has two distinctions - "saddhetu" and Hetabhasa
 saddhetu main nimnlikhit paanch rup avashya hone chahie : Here, the completion of the above five forms is necessary only for the concept of knowledge
 kevalanwai saddhetu ke liye "vipakshsatv" se atirikt chaar roopon se hi sampann hona apekshit hota he
 The fallacy - the knowledge of which is allowed by the restriction of the consequent philosophy or dogmatism - is called "hetbash" - in the sense of causal defect and the causes in which these faults occur - "in the sense of evil" - "hetbash" is
 hetugat dosha ke paanch bhed maane jate hai
 From the following table it can be understood who those distinctions are, what is committed by them, and what are the names of the evil men with them? anumiti ke kaaran - ling - hetu kaa trividh paraamarsh anumiti kaa kaaran hota he
 "knowledge of relation for favor" is called first gender counseling - such as "mountain fumigation" This kind of knowledge of the relation of Dhoom in the mountain
 "hetu main saadhy kii vyapti kaa gyaan" dwitiya ling paraamarsh kaha jaataa he - jaise dhooma main, vahrivyapti kaa "dhoomo vahri vyapya:" is prakaar kaa gyaan
 The knowledge of the relation of the subject in favor is called "third or extreme gender counseling" - such as the knowledge of the relation of the "dhoomya Vyaprayya Dhoomu" of the relation of Dhoomya Vyapya in the mountain
 pakshata - "pakshata" bhi anumiti kaa ek kaaran he
 This is considered to be the reason for permission to prevent the origin of permission in the event that the provable is decided in favor
 chir pracheen naiyayikon ne "sadhysanshay" ko, udaynacharya ne "anumiti vishyak ichha" ko, pakshdhar mishra ne anumitijanak ichha ke rup main "anumaata kii anumiti - ichha" ko tathaa uske abhaav main "ishwar kii ichha" ko or gangashopadhyaay ne "sishadhyishavirahavishishtsiddhyabhaav" ko "pakshata" mana he
 The intention of Gangesopadhyay is that permission is not generated at the same time when there is a proven accomplishment on the side and there is no desire to know that goal by inference; But when there is a desire to know the meaning by inference, permission also arises in the case of provability in favor
 uske liye sadhysanshay yaa anumitata kii niyat apeksha nahin hoti
 Restrictions - This is also the reason for permission
 ise nimnlikhit talika ke anusaar chaar rup main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Permission is prohibited by these four decisions; Therefore, the absence of these four determinations leads to permission in the form of "restriction"
 vyapti - vyapti gyaan ko dwitiya lingaparamarsh ke rup main anumiti kaa kaaran kaha gaya he
 In the interpretation of this coverage, the Nyayikas have displayed great effort; Because this is the cornerstone of the proof of inference
 vyapti mukhya rup se do prakaar kii maani gai he - "anvayavyapti" or "vyatirekvyapti"
 The extent to which the body - the comprehensiveness for the purpose - is penetrated is called the Siddhantabhaita Anvayyapati - such as "for the universal comprehension
 or jis vyapti ke sharir main - hetvbhaav main saadhyabhavvyaapakatv- kaa pravesh ho use "vyatirekvyapti" kaha jaataa hai - saadhyabhavvyapakabhav pratiyogitv"
 Exploitation means that for the sake of being in the shelter of such a cause, which is not lacking in any shelter
 or vyatirekvyapti kaa taatpary yah he ki saadhyabhaav ke aashrayon main hetvbhaav kaa hona
 For example, due to absence of any shelter in the comet, it is widespread in the sky and there is a spurt in the shelter of that planet; Similarly, there is a lack of dhoom in the shelters of Vahnibhava; Hence, both the "anvay" and "vyatarek" of Vahni remain in Dhoom
 vyaptigyaan ke upaay - vyatigyaan ke teen sadhak maane jate hai- "vyabhichaar kaa agyaan," "hetu main sadhyasahachaar yaa saadhyabhaav main hetvabhavsahachaar" kaa gyaan or "tark"
 The first two of these are universal means of philosophy; But logic is not always expected
 jaisaa ki vishwanath ne apane bhashaa pariched naamak granth ke gun prakaran main kaha he : Logic - Gautam has said the characteristics of logic: 
 Subsequent Navya Nyayikas have characterized the argument as follows: "the dietary accusation of the wider than the dietary charge of the practitioner" is "logic"
 is tark kaa vipareet anumaan main arthath vyapak u apadya ke abhaav se vyapya u aapadak ke abhaav ke anumaan main paryavasann hona isaki shuddhta kaa nikash mana jaataa he
 Whenever the suspicion of practicable adultery starts to ban the prevalence of knowledge, that doubt is nullified by logic and paves the path of prevalence
 jaise-pakgrihagat dhooma main pagrihagat vahri ke sahachaar kaa gyaan hone par bhi jab parvatiy dhooma main vahrivyabhichaar kii shankaa hoti he, use dur karne ke liye "tark" kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 Eg - "in any Dhoom, when the adultery is committed, it will not be the cause of the Dhoom and it is not possible that the Dahiri should not be considered as the cause of Dhoom; because in that case the fixed tendency of man in the eclipse of Dhoom for editing Dhoom
 Will be omitted "
 is tark ke falswaroop yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki "dhooma vahri se utpann hota he at: usamen vahrivyabhichaar kaa abhaav he" or is nishkarsh ke nishpann hote hi parvatiy dhooma main vahrivyabhichaar kii shankaa nivrutt ho jane se dhooma main vahrivyapti kaa gyaan nirbaadh rup se sampann ho jaataa he
 The example of the above argumentative formula depicts the soul of logic, interdependence, chakraka, non-existence of the logic and the different hindrances of the four, each illustrating these five distinctions
 oopaadhi - jo padaarth ke sab aashrayon main rahata ho par hetu ke sab aashrayon main na rahata ho, "oopaadhi" kaha jaataa he
 There are three distinctions of the title - broad of pure practicable, broad of unambiguous provable and broad of mean provable
 oopaadhi kaa gyaan vyaptigyaan kaa sidhaa virdohi nahin hota he
 That is, the adulteration of a broad degree practicable in the forwards causes him to experience practicable adultery, and that presumptive adultery of the practicum leads to an explicit restriction of prevalence
 ek padaarth main anya padaarth ke saadrishygyan "upmaan" pramaan kaha jaataa he
 This gives the knowledge of the power relation of a particular word in the meaning
 uski prakriya is prakaar he
 When an Aranya resident tells a villager that there is an animal named Gaavya like your cow in the Aranya, when you go to the Aranya, then the animal whom you see as your cow, should consider it as a village, accordingly when the villager will ever find the Aranya Goes and sees an animal similar to his cow there, he remembers the Aranavasi and he consequently decides the power connection of the song in that animal
 Is
 is prakaar gavay main gosaadrishy kaa darshan upmankraman, aranyavasi ke dwaara updisht arth kaa samaran uskaa vyapaar tathaa gavay main gavay shabd kii shakti kaa nishchay upamiti naamak fal kaha jaataa he
 Udayanacharya has said the same thing in advance
 vishwanath nyaayapanchanan kii agrim karikaon main yah vishay or bhi vishad he : See also - proof jisamen padaarth ke shakti yaa lakshan sambandh ke gyaan se padaarth kaa samaran hokar padaarth kaa anubhav hota he, use "shabd pramaan" kaha jaataa he
 The word Ghat and Ganga are proof in the meaning of Ghat and Gangatiar in the meaning of Ghat and the experience of Gangatiar in the word Ganga, with the knowledge of Ghatpartha in the word Ghatpartha; 
 amuk shabd amuk arth kaa bodhak ho, athwa amuk arth amuk shabd se bodhit ho, is prakaar ke anadi ishwar-sanket ko shakti kaha jaataa he
 Just as King Bhagiratha created milk from the curse of Kapil Muni and for the salvation of his ancestral essence, the waterflood that was introduced to the earth, the infinite sign of the Ganges in that deluge is the power of the word Ganga in that sense
 jis arth main jis shabd kaa anadi sanket na hokar aadhunik sanket hota he, us arth main us shabd ke aadhunik sanket ko "paribhaasha" kaha jaataa he
 Such as a name defined by its creator for a novel object
 shabd ke shakyarsambandh ko "lakshana" kaha jaataa he
 Such as the coincident relationship of the word waterflow with the arrow
 jab kisi shabd se shakti dwaara vaktaa ke abhimath arth kii pratiti nahin ho paati us shabd se lakshan dwaara us arth kii pratiti sampann ho jaati he
 According to jurisprudence, the strength and characteristics of meaning are dependent on pure words of Sanskrit language, words of other languages are considered abusive or abusive in terms of jurisprudence
 apbhransh shabd se arth kii pratiti hoti he jab usamen arth kii paribhaasha kii gai hoti he yaa usamen arth kaa shaktibhram hota he
 Apart from power and character, no semantic relation to the name vyjana is valid in jurisprudence
 jis arth ke avabodh ke liye aise tisare sambandh kii aavashyaktaa samajhi jaati he, uskaa bodh kahin lakshana se, kahin gyaan lakshan sannikarsh ke dwaara man se or kahin anumaan se hi sampann ho jaataa he
 The word proof has two distinctions - cosmic and Vedic
 inamen loukik shabdaawalee ko anya loukik pramaanon ke samvaad se hi pramaan mana jaataa he, par vaidic shabdaawalee ko kisi loukik pramaan ke samvaad ke bina bhi pramaan mana jaataa he
 Vedic memories are called cosmic or Vedic, but their authenticity depends on the dialogue of the Vedas
 shabd pramaan honevaale anubhav ko shabdabodh kaha jaataa he
 That seven issues arise in the case of pedigree, post-matter relation knowledge, matter memory aspiration, attachment or attachment, lack of ability or disqualification, tatvagyan or purposive case
 anubhav or samaran - ukt chaar pramaanon se honevaale gyaan anubhav kaha jaataa he
 There are two distinctions of experience - neglectful and non-observant
 jo anubhav apane vishay kaa koi sanskaar daale bina hi villin ho jaataa he use "upekshaatmak anubhav" tathaa jo anubhav apane vishay kaa sanskaar utpann kar nasht hota he use "anupekshaatmak" anubhav kaha jaataa he
 In the course of time, the same awareness of the same experience that is created by the awakening of this rite is called "remembrance"
 samaran kii yatharthata or ayatharthata anubhav kii yatharthata or ayatharthata par nirbhar hoti he
 Recollection is considered to be different from both proof and confusion, because he must assume additional proof for it if he believes the proof and additional defect in the form due to it, which is not proper
 pratybhigna - dharapravahee pratyakshgyaan ko "pratybhigna" kaha jaataa he
 It originates from the combined trade of culture and sense
 purvadrisht evam drishyman padaarth kii ekta kaa graahak hone se vahi sthaayee padaarth kii satta main pramaan hota he
 When the mind is observant of a subject from the contiguity of the combined senses, as long as the senses of the senses and the senses of the senses remain with that subject, immunity becomes a new new perception of that subject
 is pratyaksh samooh ko hi dharawahi gyaan kaha jaataa he
 This knowledge is also considered to be pragmatic because the subject is unobstructed
 anyathaakhyati - janya saviklpak gyaan ke do bhed hote hai- prama or bhram
 Another name for confusion is "otherwise known"
 iske teen bhed hote hai- sanshay viparyay or aarope
 In the same intention, a knowledge of two opposing substances is called "sambhaya", such as "word: Nityo na va"
 kisi vastu main anya vastu ke dharm kaa nishchay "viparyay" kaha jaataa he, jaise surya ke prakaash main chamakati seepi main chandeepan kaa gyaan
 The knowledge arising out of the will of the knower while possessing opposing knowledge is called "accusation" or "dietary", such as a thug selling a hand to a clown by telling Ranga the silver, despite knowing the lack of silverness in the ranga, it willfully contains silveriness Knowledge
 in anya vyaakhyatiyon kii upapatti karne ke liye hi nyaayashastra main "gyanalakshan" alokik sannikarsh kii kalpana kii gai he
 Autonomy, paratastattva - the knowledge of knowledge and illusion are two distinctions
 unki utpatti tathaa pramaatv yaa bhramatv rup se unki jeapti ke bare main bhinn bhinn darshanon ke bhinn bhinn mat hai, kintu nyaayashastra main yah baat maani gai he ki prama kii utpatti swat: arthath gyaan saamaanya ke kaaran maatr se na hokar gunatmak kaaran kii sahaayta se hoti he or bhram kii utpatti swat: na hokar doshaatmak kaaran kii sahaayta se hoti he
 In the same way, the knowledge of the principal and illusion of knowledge also comes from the knowledge of the self, that is, not the mere causal nature of the knowledge, but the knowledge of the principle is "successful propitious inference" and illusionism is "unsuccessful predictive"
 jis gyaan se honevaali pravriti safal arthath gyaat vishay kii prapika hoti he, use prama samajha jaataa he or jis gyaan se honevaali pravriti vifal arthath gyaat vishay kii prapika nahin hoti, use bhram kaha jaataa he
 In the known disciplines of jurisprudence, debate, jalp and vitanda also have an important place
 in teenon ko vatsyayan ne apane nyaaybhashya main "katha" shabd se vyavahrut kiya he
 Katha means the mutual views of scholars on a subject which are available in the form of pleadings, jalp and vittanda
 tatv nirnay ke uddeshy se kiye janevaale vichaar ko "vaad" evam pratidwandvi par vijay praapt karne ke uddeshy se kiye janevaale vichaar ko "jalp" tathaa "vitanda" kaha jaataa he
 The use of "deceit" and "caste" in the Promising Thought and "aphasiddhanta" is considered to be the emergence of additional lesser places from "inferior", "more" and "fallacy"
 is vichaar main sabha, madhyasth evam raja yaa rajpratinidhi kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 The scholars who participate in it are not avinavantavanchak, asuwanya or obstinate
 shuddh nyaay se tatvanirnay par pahunchnaa hi uskaa lakshya hota he
 There is no sense of Jayaparajaya among the thinkers
 jalp or vitanda kaa swabhaav vaad se paryaapt bhinn he
 The aim of the scholars who participate in these ideas is not to decide, but to prove themselves victorious by making their opponent silent
 isiilie in vichaaron main chal or jati ke prayog tathaa sabhi prakaar ke nigrah sthanon ke udbhaavna kii kaat rahati he, saath hi vichaar ke nirvighn sanchaalan ke liye sabha, madhyasth or rajkeey niyantran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 There is a lot of difference in their nature even when there is a unity between the purpose of Jalpa and Vitanda
 jaise jalp main vaadi or prativaadee donon apane apane paksh kaa saadhan or parapaksh kaa khandan karte hai, par vitanda main keval vaadi hi apane paksh ke saadhan kaa prayaas karata he, prativaadee vaadi ke paksh kaa khandan karne main hi apni krutharthata maanakar apane paksh kii sthapana tathaa uske saadhan ke prayaas se virat rahata he
 The "litigation" for elemental judgment and "jalp" and defense of vitanda are considered to be useful for protecting the decided element
 ye vishay bhi nyaayashastra ke pramukh vishyon main hai
 a knowledge of deceit is necessary to protect his side from the defendant's fraudulent attack
 vaadi ke paksh kaa khandan karne ke liye uske vachan main uske anbhimat arth kii kalpana ko "chal" kaha jaataa he
 There are three distinctions of deceit - prevarication, general care and treatment
 swayan "jati" ke prayog se bachane ke liye tathaa prativaadee dwaara "jati" kaa prayog hone par uskaa asaduttaratv ghoshit karne kii kshamta praapt karne ke liye "jati" kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 In the absence of coverage, "caste" is the name to show fault in favor of the plaintiff only with the virtue or validness: jati ke choubees bhed hai - Knowledge of possession is necessary to protect yourself from falling into the confinement and to qualify the defendant to be admitted by directing the Declaration upon reaching the defendant's sanctuary
 iske baees bhed hai- pratigyaahani, pratigyaantar, pratigyavirodh, pratigyasanyas, hetvantar, arthantar, nirarthak, avigyatarth, aparthak, apraptkaal, nune, adhik, punarukt, ananubhaashan, agyaan, apratibha, vikshep, matanugna, paryanuyojyopekshan, niranuyojyanuyog, apsiddhant or hetvabhaas
 In order to know the characteristics and examples of the above distinctions of deceit, caste and the place of incorporation, one should look at the second Ahrik and Pancha Chapters of the first chapter of the judiciary and the judge of Vatsyayana on them
 aatma - jo davy chaitanya aashray hota he, use aatma kaha jaataa he
 He has two distinctions - Jeevatma and Paramatma
 paramatma- paramatma kaa hi naam ishwar he
 He is another comprehensive
 gyaan, ichha or praytn uske vishesh gun hai or ve sabhi nity thitha sarvavishyak hai
 God creates the world according to the auspicious, inauspicious deeds of living beings
 sristi ke aarambh main jeevon ke hitarth vedon kaa nirmaan karata he
 The Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras arrange these four varnas and the four ashrams of Brahmacharya, Garhastya, Vanaprastha and Sannyas impart education to the people of Varnashrama Dharma and various other types of folk behavior
 vahi jagat kaa srashta hone se brahma, paalak hone se vishnu tathaa sanharta hone se rudra naam se vyavahrut hota he
 He is obsessed with inference and scripture
 kadachit uskaa pratyaksh bhi hota he, par vah keval siddh yogi ko hi
 The number of souls is infinite
 prayek jeev vyapak tathaa gyaan, ichha, praytn aadi vishesh gunon kaa aashray or un gunon ke saath man dwaara pratyaksh vedya he
 Every living being is bounded from time immemorial by virtue of lustful deeds and lust for a variety of experiences
 dev, daanav, yaksha, gandharva, manushya, pashu, pakshi, saanp, bichchhu, keede, makode, lata, vanaspati aadi vividh char-achar yoniyon main uskaa janm hota rahata he
 He does not get rid of the said bondage and emotional sorrow when he does not become an element of God and spirit
 moksh - nyaayashastra main ikkis prakaar ke du:kha maane gaye hai
 These six senses are olfactory, eye, skin, brain and mind; Smell, rasa, form, touch, word and raga are special defects; these six subjects; Six subject experiences, body pleasure and grief resulting from contact with the subordinates - the last of these "griefs" is the main sorrow due to nature being malice, but happiness is due to being attached to the main grief and other nineteen
 Because of being the father of the main sorrows, there are minor sorrows - the only name to get rid of these twenty-one sorrows forever is "moksha"
 mokshasaadhan - saddharm ke anushthan se "chitt kaa shodhan" "padaarthon kaa tatv gyaan" tathaa "aatma ke vaastavik swaroop kaa pratyaksh bodh" ye teen moksh ke saadhan hai
 With the devotion of ritual, routine and nishkam karma, and by the everlasting ritual, when a man refines his mind, he becomes disenchanted with the subjects of the world, as a result of which he is aware of the substances of the world, especially God and the Self
 us jigyaasa se prerit hokar vah sadguru ke charnon main pahunch, usase shasr kaa adhyayan kar pramaan,
 prameya aadi solah padaarthon kaa - jinka nyaay - vaisheshik ke marmajna vidwaanon ne dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh, samavaay or abhaav in saat padaarthon main antarbhaav kar liya he - tatvagyan arjeet karata he
 By attaining eternal meditation, nididhyasana and long-term uninterrupted practice, the divine supernatural psyche of the divine and the cosmic psyche of a special deity-free soul is attained by attaining life before the order stated in the second sutra of justice philosophy, that is, in life itself, free from all bondage
 Goes and after the destiny karma ends by enjoyment, relationship with the present body Odkr receives Videhmukti
 pun: kabhi kisi bhi rup main uskaa janm nahin hota or vah ishwar ke samaan nitant nirdu:kha ho apane nisargasiddh shuddh shaashvat rup main sadaa ke liye pratishthit ho jaataa he

 maharaj bhojraj kaa samay isvi san 1010-1055 tak itihaaskaaron dwaara sweekrut kiya gaya he
 Therefore, the creation period of Saraswati Kantha Bharan can be considered to be mid-eleventh century AD
 iske praneta kavyprakash ke rachayita mammat se kinchit purvavarti hai
 Although the sound of doctrine was established by Anandavardhana, the recognition of sound as Kavyatma was disputed till that time; Therefore, neither Bhojdev nor Bhatt Mammat adopted the determination to give voice as a soul in the definition of poetry in a literal sense
 donon aacharyon ne kavy main doshabhaav tathaa gunvattta ko pradhanta di he
 It is the specialty of Bhojdev that he has accepted the utility of ornaments and has considered it necessary for poetry to be restored
 yon bhojdev ke saraswatikanthabharan ne anshat: mammat ko evam vishwanath ko prabhavit kiya he
 Saraswati Kantha Bharan is a long text containing five passages
 pratham pariched main rachayita ne kavyasaamanya kii paribhaasha dene ke pashchaat sarvapratham kavy ke deergh evam gun kaa vivechan kiya he
 In this context, Bhojdev has given verse, sentence and syntactic defects
 har prakaar ke dosha kii sankhya solah he
 According to Bhojdev, qualities, words and sentences are known and each has twenty-four distinctions
 pratham pariched ke ant main katipay dosha kahin kahin gun ban jate hai
 By illustrating this poetry, he has accepted the routine of poetry
 dwitiya pariched main shabdalankar kaa nirnay karte hue unhone sarvapratham auchiti par bal diya tathaa jati, reeti, vritti, chaaya, mudra, ukti, yukti, bhaniti, gunfna, shayya evam pathiti kaa sodaaharan vivechan kiya he
 Except for the custom of these twelve elements, detailed explanation of the remaining elements is not found in any other available literature in Sanskrit
 banbhatta ne kavyasaushthav ke vishesh tatv, shayya kaa ullekh kiya he parantu uski paribhaasha keval saraswatikanthabharan main hi uplabdh hoti he
 Thereafter, an example is given of the vulgar distinctions of puns, puns, alliteration, pictures, pralica, esoteric and q & As
 is ansh main bhi saraswatikanthabharan kii sarvatha nijee visheshta he
 Subsequently, Bhojdev, discussing the causes of poetry, presents three distinctions of poetry in the form of audio, visual and pictorial
 drishykavy ke antargat unhone dasharupakon kaa ullekh nahin kiya he varan nritt evam nrity par hi unka vibhaajan simit he
 In the third passage, there is a discussion of the difference between the form and the type of economists, which take different forms than other literatures
 chauthe pariched main ubhayalankaron kaa vivechan he jisamen upama aadi alankaaron ke bhedopabhedon ko savistaar samajhaayaa he
 The last passage is rasvivechan
 isamen naikadi kaa tathaa vibhaavon, bhaavon evam anubhaavon kaa vistaarpurvak swaroop nirnay kiya gaya he; saath hi saath kavypaak, vividh ratiraag ke swaroop kaa bhi nirdesh he
 At the end there is a epilogue with a discussion of vrittis like Bharati, Kaishiki etc
 saraswatikanthabharan main rassidhant kii vivechna praaia: vishay par ek vihangam drushtimaatr he
 Poetic poetry is a serious matter, with a view to doing justice to it with dignity, Bhoja completes the chapter of Rasavivechan by composing an independent book called Shringarprakash
 saraswatikanthabharan kii visheshta yah he ki yah itar sahityashastreey granthon kii apeksha vyapak evam vyutpaadak granth he
 Its creator Bhojdev is not going to be afraid of Granthavistar, he always makes a generous effort to explain many subtle differences and strains by giving examples
 yadhyapi unke dwaara upasthaapit bhedopabhedon kii manyata parvarti granthkaaron ne sweekrut nahin kii he tathaapi unke tathvik vivechan se sahasaa asahmat hone kii dridhtaa bhi kutraapi drushtigochar nahin hoti
 There is no creation of a commentary on this book
 pehle teen parichchhedon par ratneshwar ramsinghkrut darpan tikaa tathaa chauthe pariched par prasiddh tikaakar jagadghar kii vivaran naamak tikaa uplabdh hai, pancham pariched kaa tikaa nahin he

 saamaanya jivan me jab ham kisi kaary vishesh ko karne kaa nirnay karte hai to us kaary ko karne se purv uski ruparekha sunishchit kii jaati he
 Compliance of all the necessary conditions related to work should be done properly and the process of removing them after considering the obstacles in the work are also important subjects to consider while preparing the outline
 kaary ke prarambh hone se kaary ke sampann hone tak ke ek ek charan par punarvichaar karke ruparekha ko antim rup dekar us kaary vishesh ko sampann kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, the desired work can be done by the computer, according to its capacity
 iske liye aavashyaktaa he sanganak ko ek nishchit takanic va kram me nirdesh diye jane kii, taaki sanganak dwaara in nirdeshon kaa anupaalan karakar vaanchit kaary ko sampann kiya ja sake
 In common parlance, it is called serialization or programming or serialization
 sabhi nirdeshon ke samooh ko program kaha jaataa he

 is line ko redcliff line ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 Begum Jaan is a prostitute who runs a brothel between the cities of Sakkargarh and Dorangala
 veshyaayein kai ladkiyaan hai jinhone khud ko uthaaya, jo yaa to unke pariwaron dwaara tyaag die gaye yaa unhen chhod diya gaya tha or ab unke liye kaam karte hai
 Members of the brothel also include an elderly woman called Amma, a local activist named Sujit, who brings her clients and Uncle Salim
 ve sarkari adhikariyon hari prasad, eliyas khan or inspector shyaam singh se yatra karte hai or un sabhi nivaasiyon se veshyalay ko bedakhal karne ke liye kah rahe hai, kyonki yah us bhoomi par he jo redcliff rekha se guzarana he sujith or rubina ke bich prem ko dikhaaya gaya he
 The brothel of Begum Jaan is kept under the supervision of Raja Saheb, under whose protection they are safe and handsome
 vah apane karon or kartavyon kaa bhugtan karata he begum jaan is maamle main unki madad ke liye unhen sandesh bhejte hai
 She arrives at the brothel and presents for them and upon hearing their plight, he assures them that they are going to Delhi soon and will discuss the matter there
 haalanki, vah yuva shabnam ke saath raat bitaane kii maang karte hai, jo haal hi main veshyalay main durvyavhaar ke baad ek maansik kshati ke rup main shaamil ho gaye the
 Begum is said to enjoy the night while she enjoys her night
 vah upakrit karne ke liye majaboor he After several unsuccessful attempts to leave him, despite giving Begum Jaan and his band a month's notice, Hari and Ilyas, as a desperate last resort, assist a notorious murderer Kabir in Sonpur, to threaten him
 Raja Saab returns to the brothel one day to inform his members of the brothel, to inform Begum Jaan that their efforts have failed and they are now forced to go to the brothel Will have to be cleared
 begum, jo ummid kar rahaa tha, niraashaa main chaunk gaya
 Kabir proceeds to kill Begum's beloved dogs, even feeds her meat to Begum and her girls
 vah phir se sujith ko martha he jab vah begum jaan ke kuch sadasyon ke saath bazaar se laut rahaa he
 He sacrifices his life and prompts them to flee
 This murder leads to Begum Jaan and her members
 kabir kii dhamkee dene kii ranneeti ke parinamswaroop, begum saleem se poochta he ki har ek ladki ko hathiyaaron kaa istemaal karne or waapas ladane ke liye prashikshan diya jaae
 Intensive training practice sessions are conducted

 He convinces Gulaba to run away from a brothel that betrays Belag Jaan
 gulaba aisa karata he, lekin masterji use chhod detaa he or use ek ghode kii gaadi main apane saathi dwaara balaatkaar karne detaa he
 He pledged vengeance usee raat, kabir or unke log veshyalay par hamalaa karte hai, begum ke rup main, or ladkiyaan ladati hai lekin koi phayda nahin
 Gulabou returns and later hits Mastrji's throat, while he is seen attacking Kabir and his brothel by a brothel
 haalanki, vah jald hi uske baad jald hi goli maar di gai
 The goons threw lighted torches inside the brothel, causing the buildings to be engulfed in flames
 begum jaan or unki ladkiyaan ek nishchit ladaai ladiin
 Many have been killed
 He and his four surviving members were seen smiling and burning their house; They walk inside the building and close the doors

 As soon as the film ends, Ilyas, Hari Prasad and Shyam Singh are seen to be insulting their actions; Ilyas shoots himself and we are shown the remains of the brothel and the end of Begum Jaan's legacy

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin
