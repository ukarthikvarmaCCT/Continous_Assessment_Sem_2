 After this, the number of stray animals has increased in Uttar Pradesh, which is proving to be a headache for the farmers
 'ajtak' ne ek ground report main aawaara pashuon se jude pahaluon kii padtaal kii
 The team of 'aajtak', who arrived in a small village of Phulpur tehsil of eastern Uttar Pradesh, saw that the stray animals are grazing the standing crop of wheat and the farmers are shooing these animals
 ek kisaan bharelal ne kaha ki mehnat karke jo fasal lagaai he, vah aawaara pashuon kaa shikaar ho rahi he
 Bhare Lal said, "the cost of farming has already gone up because the prices of fertilizer, urea and dye have gone up
 upar se pashu kheton ko char jate hai to kisaan roti kahaan se khayega?'bharelal ke mutabik, phulpur ilaake main kai hajaar acre kheton menfasalkharaab ho gai he
 The crop standing in his own 3 bighas was ruined
 unhone bataaya ki pashuon ke fasal par chadhane ke baad dobaaraa khaad daalani padati he
 One has to work hard again in the field and then the animals feed him
 bharelal jaise kisaan yogi sarkaar se behad naaraaz hai
 He alleges that the government not only increased the price of fertilizers but also reduced the amount of fertilizers available to the farmers
 aawaara pashuon ke aatank se naaraaz bharelal kaa kahana he ki agle chunaav main yogi ormodiko iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Farmers are angry because of rising cost of farming so much that farmers have started putting barbed wire around their fields
 jaahir he isse kheti kii laagat bhi bad rahi he
 The crops of the farmers who are able to survive are saved, the farmers who are poor are falling prey to livestock
 prayagrajamen bhi kisaanon ke khet pashuon kii bhent chadh rahe hai
 The farmers are warning the BJP government for this
 unka kahana he ki jab se yogi kii sarkaar bani he, tab se kisaanon kaa zyada nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Farmers say that instead of having to work day by day, they have to take care of the fields
 din se zyada pashuon kaa utpaat raat main he
 Nandlal, who lives in Prayagraj, says that the problem has increased more since last year
 har ilaake main 30-40 pashu kheton main gum rahe hai or ek jagah se bhagaae jane ke baad duusare ilaakon main kheton main bhatak rahe hai
 Crops are getting destroyed due to this
 nandlaal kaa kahana he ki pehle dhan kii fasal pashu kha gaye or abgehunki fasal bhi bachani mushkil lag rahi he
 Nandlal told 'aajatak' that a wet land was not built in this area where these cattle could be kept
 nandlaal bhi maanate hai ki kisaanon kii naaraazgi chunaav main haar kii badi vajah ban sakati he
 The same picture is also visible in Pratapgarh, working during the day and monitoring at night
 gehun, aalu, sarson or matar kii fasal khadi ho rahi hai lekin kisaanon ko dar he ki aawaara pashu ise bhi nahin chodenge
 There is a forest in the vicinity from where the herd of these animals reach the fields every day to satisfy their hunger
 pramila or phulkali pratapgarh ke is chote se gaanv kii kisaan hai
 Pramila says that she does not sleep in worry overnight
 phulkali kaa kahana he ki unki gehun kii fasal bhi jaanavar kha gaye, matar kii fasal bhi pashuon ne nahin chodi
 These farmers say that people from other nearby villages leave their animals in each other's villages
 gaushala nirmaan ke daawey yahaan bhi khokhale sabit hue
 Pramila and Phoolkali do not even know that a cowshed has been built here, but they definitely say that the farmers will definitely show their displeasure in the elections
 phulkali kahati hai ki agar kisaanon ko samasya hogi to vot bhi khilaaf main hi denge
 People do not want the cow dynasty to be killed, but they definitely want the Yogis to fulfill their promise and build gaushalas in the area so that their crop can be saved
 kahin baari na pad jaaen aawaara pashupratapgarh main kisaanon ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet menyogi sarkaarper aaropon kii bauchhaar laga di
 When the nearby sarpanches gathered, their pain came in front of the stray animals
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki pashuon ko bachaane ke liye kisaanon kii laagat bad rahi he
 On the other hand, the farmer is only incurring losses due to non-availability of crop
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki jab chaare kii vyavastha nahin he to aise main kitne maveshi kisaan paalenge
 The farmers are warning that the resentment of the farmers will be revealed in the election and its impact will be seen to be serious
 pratapgarh se purv vidhayak auzkhileshsarkaar main swasthya mantri rahe shivakant ojha kaa kahana he ki paune 2 saal kii yogi sarkaar ne kahin bhi gaushala nahin banaai
 The SP leader claims that the anger that the farmers have caused this will be borne by the BJP in the 2019 elections
 loksabhachunaavon kii shuruyaat main ab 100 din se kam kaa samay bachaa he
 In such a situation, the resentment of farmers in Uttar Pradesh can become a major concern for the BJP
 sapa or bispi ke mahagathbandhan ke kayaas pehle se hi modi or yogi ko pareshaan kiye hue hai
 In such a situation, if the Annadata too rebels from the BJP, then in 2019 Delhi's seat may be removed
