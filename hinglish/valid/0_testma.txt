 yah brahm swadhin hokar bhi bhakt ke adheen ho jaataa he
 Like the Vishayadvaita, the Shuddhadvaita has also told the world the truth along with Brahma
 karanroop brahm ke satya hone par kaaryrup jagat mithyaa nahin ho saktaa
 Because of being a replica of Brahm, the Trikalabadha power of the world
 jeev or jagat kaa naash nahin hota, sirf aavirbhaav or tirbhaav hota he
 Pushtimarga molds the philosophy of Shuddhadvaita into devotion
 pushti kaa shabdic arth he ‘poshan’
 In the Srimad Bhagwat, the grace of God is called nourishment - "nurture accordingly"
 vallabhacharya ke anusaar, “krishnaugraharoopa hi pushtih kaladi baadhak”
 That is, the grace of Krishna, freeing him from the influence of Kaladi, is a confirmation
 pushtimargi bhakthi kaa muladhar bhagawatkrupa or unke prati purna samarpan he
 Even before the devotee turns his attention to the Lord, the Lord pours his grace on the devotee

 janm maran ke bandhan main bandhe jeev ko ‘pravaah jeev’ kehete hai
 The Jiva who tries to get Brahman knowledge from the study of Vedas, Upanishads etc
 is called 'maryada Jiva' and Jiva makes devotion and affection of God his support, it is called 'confirmation Jiva'
 pushti maarg main bhakthi kii bhi teen prakaar kii avadharanaayen hai- pravaah pushti bhakthi, maryaada pushti bhakthi or shuddh pushti bhakthi
 a devotee tied in the cycle of birth and death under 'flow confirmation devotion' remembers God and attains gradual salvation
 ‘maryaada pushti bhakthi’ ke antargat bhakt shastron se brahm gyaan praapt karne ke baad bhagwaan kii ore unmukh hota he or moksh kii ore badhata he
 In 'pure affirmation devotion' the devotee surrenders himself completely to the Lord's refuge
 yahan bhagwaan apane bachche kii tarah bhakt kaa paalan karte hai
 a devotee who is completely devoted at the feet of God becomes a part of the Lord's affection
 shuddh pushti bhakt kii mukti sabase shuddh, saral or sugam hoti he
 All the sorrows of the devotee disappear as soon as they come under the shelter of God
 pushti margi bhakthi ko maadhurya bhakthi, premabhakti yaa raganuga bhakthi kehete hai
 In this devotion, there is a spiritual adaptation of the form of dressing

 lok-prashasan ke shaikshik adhyayan kaa prarambh karne kaa shrey woodro wilson ko jaataa he jisane 1887 main prakashit apane lekh ‘da study of administration' main is shaastra ke vaigyanik aadhaar ko viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa par bal diya
 This article showed a clear distinction between politics and administration and declared that administration should stay away from politics
 isi ko tathakthith ‘raajnneeti-prashasan-dvibhajan’ kehete hai
 The history of public administration is divided into the following 5 stages- ek vishay ke rup main lok-prashasan kaa janm 1887 main hua
 Woodrow Wilson, the then professor of political science at Princeton University in America, is considered the father of this scripture
 unhone 1887 main prakashit apane lekh 'prashasan kaa adhyayan' main raajnneeti or prashasan ko alag-alag bataate hue kaha- "ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan saral he par ise chalaanaa bada kathin he
 "he emphasized the study of this 'running' field, which is clearly 'administration'
" unhone raajnneeti or prashasan main bhed kiya
 The publication of Wilson's article in 1887 marked the birth of a new era in which public administration gradually developed into a new field of study
 yahan yah ullekhneey he ki anya deshon kii tulana main sanyukt rajya america main lok-prashasan ke adhyayan par vishesh bal diya jane laga
 There administration has developed as a science for which people take admission in management schools
 is vishay ke anya mahatvapurn praneta frank gudnau hai jinhone 1900 main prakashit apni pustak ‘raajnneeti or prashasan’ main yah tark prastut kiya ki raajnneeti or prashasan alag-alag hai kyonki jahaan raajnneeti rajya-ichha ko pratipaadit karti he vahaan prashasan kaa sambandh is ichha yaa rajya-nitiyon ke kriyanvayan se he
 In fact, this was the time when the government sector in the US was dominated by laxity and corruption and as a result, government-reform movements were going on
 is sudhaar-aakankshi vaataavaran main anek vidyalayon main lok-prashasan kaa adhyayan-adhyaapan shuru ho gaya
 In 1914, the American Political Science Association said in a report that catering to skilled people to work in government is one of the goals of the study of political science
 falswaroop lok-prashasan raajnneeti vigyaan kaa ek pramukh ang ban gaya or iske adhyayan-adhyaaapak ko baari protsaahan mila

 Hunite's book 'the Role of the Study of Public Administration' was published
 vah lok-prashasan kii pratham pathyapustak thi jisamen raajnneeti-prashasan ke algaav main vishwaas vyakt kiya gaya or lekhak ne apni yah manyata prakat kii ki lok-prashasan kaa mukhya lakshya dakshata or mitvyayta he
 Many editions of the book of Hahnite have been published and are still not in vogue even today, but it is considered an important work of public administration
 lok-prashasan ke vikaas ke is pratham charan kii do pramukh visheshtaayen raheen - lok-prashasan kaa udai or raajnneetik evam prashasan ke algaav main vishwaas

 From Willoughby's book 'principles of Public Administration'
 vilobi ne yah pratipaadit ki lok-prashasan main anek siddhanth hai jinako kriyanvit karne main lok-prashasan ko sudhara ja saktaa he
 In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to say that both the Hannite and Willoughby authors' texts dictated the method of study and study of public administration textbooks
 in donon hi pustakon kaa rup takneekee he jinamein un sabhi prakaar kii saamaanya samasyaon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he, jinhen ‘posocarb’ shabd main samahit kiya ja saktaa he
 The subject-matter problems arising in the specific field of administrative studies are not found in these books
 ye donon hi pravarttak granth is manyata par aadhaarit hai ki lok-prashasan ko raajnneeti se pruthak or swatantra hona chahie tathaa iske siddhanton ko mote taur par sahaj hi pahachaanaa or paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 After the above book of Willoughby, many scholars started writing books on public administration, some notable names - Mary Parker Follett, Henry Fayol, Moon, Railey, etc
 1937 main luther gulik tathaa urvik ne milakar lok-prashasan par ek mahatvapurn pustak kaa sampaadan kiya jiskaa naam he ‘prashasan vigyaan par nibandh’ 
 It was the belief of all these scholars of the second phase that due to the principle of administration, it is a science and hence it is not appropriate to put the word 'lok' in front of it
 siddhanth to sabhi jagah lagu hote hai, chaahe vah 'lok-kshetra' ho yaa 'nijee-kshetra'
 The main feature of the second phase was that it was now emphasized that there are some principles of administration
 isse is vishay kaa saiddhanthik swaroop ubhara
 This condition is considered necessary to enrich any subject
 ab prashasan main siddhanton ko chunauti dene kaa yug prarambh hua
 The phase from 1938 to 1947 was more destructive in the field of public administration
 san 1938 main chester barnard kii ‘karypalika ke kaary’ naamak pustak prakashit hui jisamen prashasan ke kisi bhi siddhanth kaa varnan nahin kiya gaya
 In 1946, Herbert, in one of his articles, rejected the so-called principles of public administration and called them 'legends'
 san 1947 main rabart dahaal ne apane ek lekh main yah siddh karne kaa praytn kiya ki lok-prashasan vigyaan nahin he or isko siddhanth kii khoj main mukhyatah teen baadhaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he- The primacy of the third phase was that the study of public administration became a victim of challenges and criticisms, which exposed new possibilities of this subject
 yah charan is arth main krantikari athwa ‘sankat kaa kaal’ rahaa ki lok-prashasan jin-jin uplabdhiyon kaa geet ga rahaa tha un sabhi ko bekaar tehra diya gaya
 As a result of the rational criticism of Herbert Simon, the 'ideological' ideology began to seem unreliable
 lok-prashasan ke swaroop ke sambandh main anek andeh uth khadey hue, yah vivaad kaa vishay ban gaya
 Therefore, the phase of 1948 to 1970 has been called the 'crisis of nature' of public administration
 is yug main lok-prashasan ne mote taur par do raste apanaae - The scholars who came under political science argued that public administration has come out of politics and is part of it
 is samay raajnneetishastra bhi kuch parivartanon ke daur se guzar rahaa tha or usamen lok-prashasan ko pehle vaala mahatva nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 It was natural that in this situation the public administration began to experience steplessness and loneliness
 lok-prashasan ke jis vikalp kii khoj hui, vah tha- ‘prashasnic vigyaan’ 
 Public administration, trade management etc
 together laid the foundation of administrative science
 yah tark prastut kiya gaya ki prashasan to prashasan hi he, chaahe vah nijee kshetra main ho yaa saarvajanik kshetra main
 In 1956 the publication of the magazine named 'administrative Signs Quarterly' started
 vastav main yah bahut akharane vaali baat thi ki lok-prashasan ke apane ‘nijee swaroop’ ko aghat pahunchaa
 The criticisms, counterclaims and challenges of the fourth phase have served the public administration well
 lok-prashasan kaa adhyayan bahucharchit ho gaya, nae-nae drushtikon viksit hue or falswaroop lok-prakaashan chahunmukhi pragati ke maarg par aage badha
 Scholars and scholars of various scriptures like Economics, Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology etc
 started taking interest in public administration
 raajnneetishastra ke adhyeta to prarambh se hilok-prashasan ke adhyayan main ruchi le rahe the
 Public administration became 'interdisciplinary' as a result of these various studies and efforts and today it is a fact that if any subject is the most 'interdisciplinary' in sociology, it is public administration
 isse lok-prashasan ke vaigyanik swaroop kaa vikaas hua
 Not only this, the field of public administration continued to expand and comparative public administration and development administration emerged
 paramparaagat drushtikon kii aparyaaptta, anusandhan ke nae upkarnon or naveen saamaajik sandarbh, anterrashtriya nirbharta aadi ne tulanaatmak lok-prashasan ko janm diya or use aage badhaayaa
 The results and methods of comparative study of public administration had a serious impact on the nature of overall public administration
 yah tathy utsahvarddhak or harshavarddhak he ki lok-prashasan main aaj pashchimi deshon kaa hi adhyayan nahin hota he, varan samyavaadee tathaa africa or asia ke desh bhi isaki paridhi main aa gaye hai
 Public publishing has moved out of the circle of a particular culture and has also been oriented towards other cultures, which has benefited more and expanded the horizons of public administration
 naveen lok-prashasan ne is mahatvapurn baat par bal diya he ki lok-prashasan ko sidhe samaaj se judaa hona chahie
 The new public administration is purely an American notion
 bharat jaise desh main naveen lok-prakaashan kii dharna yaa vichaaron kaa prasar vyapak rup se nahin hua he

 In the early years of his reign, he attracted the attention of the entire public
 usne sampoorn rashtriya jivan main samarpan, tyaag evam naitikta kii bhaavana ko prerit kiya
 But he became so proud of himself for his sattvikta and purposes that he started thinking that those who opposed him were opposing God

 In his election campaign, he gave the slogan of Progressivism, abandoning the orthodox views of the past

 It was a matter of great importance for America's future that he had found such a person as President who transformed the basis of this war into a 'noun of salvation and reform'

 ”is mahaan shantipurna janata ko yuddh kii ore-jo sabase adhik bhayanak or vidhvansak yuddh he

 “ After the war, whether Wilson had suffered defeat and whether it was bitterly criticized by nominal realists, his speech was a turning point in American history and politics

 Immediately worked to fulfill this promise
 iske purv kii kisi sarkaar ne yuddh main isse adhik budhimaani ore kaaryakshmata nahin dikhalaai thi
 Even before this, the Americans did not show such vigor, resourcefulness and invented intelligence
 “ ‘bina vijay kii shanti’ yuddh kaa naaraa ban gaya tha
 After the cease-fire treaty, Wilson, who did not listen to the advice of his secretary, reached the Paris Peace Conference in December 1918, he was welcomed as the 'messiah of Peace'
 europe main us samay yah bhaavana vidyaman thi ki keval wilson hi aisa vyakti he jo vibhinn rashtron ke raag-dwesh or unki irshyaa-bhaavana se upar uthaa hua evam maanavtaa kaa rakshak he
 Therefore, when this philosopher king took the booklet of his principles in his hand, armed with military power, came to set the terms of the treaty, the people of Europe opened his heart in his honor
 sabhi deshon main uskaa abhootpurv swaagat hua
 When he reached Paris, the French were delighted to see him
 sadakon par apaar jan-samooh ne uski stuti kii or akhabaaron ne uske gungan kiye
 In fact, everyone's eyes were on him
 vijayi nyaay kii, vijit dayaa kii or saamaanya jan-shakti kii aashaa karte the
 Wilson came to this conference as a lamp of peace
 vah nahin chahta tha ki paris sammelan 1815 ke vienna congress jaise nihit swaarthon kaa garh ban jaye
 But he could not guess that the conquering nations had a vestige of selfishness and if he had kept other facts in mind, he would have escaped the trap or deception in which he himself got badly entangled by his idealism
 uske pavitra uddeshy vijeta rashtron kii satta-pipaasa ke aage bhasmasaat ho gayi
 Wilson presented his ideas as the famous 14 sutras
 uske 14 sutron main pratham sutara yahi tha ki shaanti ke samjhaute saarvajanik rup se kiye jaayengen, koi gupt samjhauta nahin hoga
 These principles were also appreciated by the politicians of the Allies
 unke paas yudhottar samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye uparokt siddhanton ke atirikt or kya tha ? or parajeet rashtron ne bhi in siddhanton ke prati apni sahmati prakat kii parantu aadarshon evam siddhanton kii antatah shakti-poojak rashtron ke saamne kuch na chal saki
 The conference was also dominated by nationalist ideas, personal interests, which were predominant in the Vienna Congress
 france kaa klemency or england kaa loyad donon ne hi wilson par apni hathvadita ko thopane main safalataa praapt kii
 RB Mobat wrote in 'european Diplomacy' that "clemenceau used to repeat this sentence in the morning - i will support the establishment of the League of Nations"
 “ kintu italy ke orlando se jab ek baar poocha gaya ki rashtrasang ke bare main aapkaa kya mat he to uttar diya tha ki ”ham nihsandeh rashtrasang kii sthapana kaa swaagat karenge kintu fum kaa prashn tay kiya janaa chaiye
 "wilson was alone in the entire conference

 This former professor of political philosophy at Princeton was a talented orator and idealist thinker
 vah kathor vishwaason kaa vyakti tha jisamen raajnneetik doordarshita to ucch koti kii thi, lekin itani kootnithik yogyata nahin thi ki vah anya pratinidhiyon ko parajeet rashtron ke saath udaar vyavhaar ke liye taiyaar kar sake
 In the words of Stanard Baker, "whoever saw him working, never dared to dare to blasphemy before Wilson or behind his back
" “ wilson kaa yah vishwaas tha ki rashtrasang kii sthapana se hi maanav jati kii raksha ho sakati he, atah vah ise sab shaanti-sandhiyon kaa anivaary ang bananaa chahta tha
 But he was not mentally as sharp as Lloyd George and Clemenceau and relied exclusively on his pre-determined ideas, so he proved to be a novice in the field of diplomacy and political bargaining
 uske adarshavaad or rashtrasang kii sthapana ke atyadhik utsaah kaa duusare deshon ne puraa laabh uthaaya
 For other nations to accept the creation of the League of Nations, Wilson was willing to give up everything, even for the League of Nations he agreed to disregard many of the principles of his 14 sources

 The Chinese state should have been found by the Chinese people on the basis of Wilson's theory of self-determination, but Wilson decided to give it to Japan with the desire to get the support of other superpowers to establish the League of Nations
 yah nirnay swayammev wilson dwaara apane siddhanton par kutharaghaat tha
 Nevertheless, if a little leniency was dealt to the defeated at the Paris Conference, it was because of Wilson
 isamen koi sandeh nahin tha ki yadi wilson sammelan main na hota to loyad jorge or klemenso na jane kya se kya kar dete
 Wilson continued to curb his infinite aspirations
 yadi wilson na hota to france germany kaa namonishaan mitaakar hi dam letaa
 Wilson had two objectives
 pratham nyaaypurna samjhauta jiske anusaar aatm-nirnay ke siddhanth par rashtron kii simaaon kaa nirdhaaran ho taaki paraspar shaanti sthapit ho sake
 Second, the establishment of the League of Nations
 pehle uddeshy main vah safal nahin hua kyonki jo shaanti kii gai vah thopi hui shaanti thi na ki aatm-nirnay ke aadhaar par yaa samjhauta-vaarta kii shaanti
 But he succeeded in the second objective
 rashtron ke sangh kaa vichaar moulik nahin tha or kai deshon main kai logon ne is vichaar ko spasht karne main yogadan diya tha, kintu jis rashtrasang kii antim rup se sthapana kii gai thi vah wilson kii hi sristi thi or uske aadarshon kaa mandir tha
 Some scholars think that Wilson himself made a huge mistake by coming to Paris
 yadi vah washington main rah kar hi american pratinidhiyon ko aadesh detaa rahata to bahut sambhav tha ki uskaa prabhaav adhik vyapak hota, par wilson ko sarvaadhik chintaa rashtrasang kii thi or uski abhilaashaa thi ki vishwa sanstha ke vidhaan kaa nirmaan vah swayan kare
 In fact, it was very unfortunate that while his presence at the conference was not beneficial to the conference itself, he could not even keep contact with the American public while away from his country, which resulted in the United Nations being nurtured by his own country
 Only rejected
 american seenet ne wilson ke rashtrasang kii sadsyta ke prastaav ko nahin mana

 Woodrow Wilson believed that public administration should separate from politics

 According to Wilson, the composition of a constitution is easy but it is difficult to implement it
 unhone kriyanvayan ke kshetra ke adhyayan par vishesh bal diya
 In his essay Study of Administration, Wilson, while discussing the interrelationships of politics and administration, wrote that administration is outside the domain of politics
 prashasnic samasyaayen raajnneetik samasyaayen nahin hoti hai
 Although politics can determine the function and nature of administration, it should not be given the right to manipulate administrative aspects

 Rakshabandhan is a Hindu and Jain festival celebrated annually on the full moon day of the month of Shravan
 shravan main manaaye jane ke kaaran ise shrawani yaa saluno bhi kehete hai
 Rakhi or Rakshasutra has the most importance in Rakshabandhan
 raakhi kachche soot jaise sasti vastu se lekar rangeen kalave, reshmi dhaage, tathaa sone yaa chaandi jaisi manhagi vastu tak kii ho sakati he
 Rakhi is usually tied only by brothers, but respect is also tied by Brahmins, Gurus and younger girls in the family
 kabhi-kabhi saarvajanik rup se kisi netaa yaa pratishthit vyakti ko bhi raakhi baandhi jaati he
 Now the tradition of tying rakhi to trees has also started for conservation of nature
 hindustan main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke purush sadsy paraspar bhaichaare ke liye ek duusare ko bhagava rang kii raakhi bandhate hai
 The Karmakandi Pandit or Acharya chants a sloka in Sanskrit while tying Rakshasutra in all the religious rituals of Hinduism, in which the relation of Rakshabandhan is clearly visible to King Bali
 bhavishyapurana ke anusaar indrani dwaara nirmit rakshasutra ko devguru brihaspati ne indra ke haathon baandhte hue nimnlikhit swastivachan kiya - The Hindi sense of this verse is - "I bind you with the same thread that the great powerful Danavendra king Bali was tied
 he rakshe ! tum adig rahanaa " Retired from bathing in the morning, girls and women decorate a plate of worship
 thali main raakhi ke saath roli yaa haldi, chaaval, deepak, mithai or kuch paise bhi hote hai
 Boys and men get ready and sit in worship or any appropriate place to get the vaccine done
 pehle abhisht devtaa kii puja kii jaati he, iske baad roli yaa haldi se bhai kaa tikaa karke chaaval ko tike par lagaaya jaataa he or sir par chhidaka jaataa he, uski aarti utaari jaati he, dahini kalai par raakhi baandhi jaati he or paison se nyochhavar karke unhen garibon main baant diya jaataa he
 In many provinces of India, there is also the practice of placing Bhojali or Bhujriya over the ear of a brother

 Thus food is served only after completing the Rakshabandhan ritual
 prayek parv kii tarah uphaaron or khaane-pine ke vishesh pakwaanon kaa mahatva rakshabandhan main bhi hota he

 purohit tathaa acharya subah-subah yajmaanon ke ghar pahunchakar unhen raakhi bandhate hai or badale main dhan, vastra or bhojan aadi praapt karte hai
 This festival is so widely and deeply ingrained in Indian society that not only its social significance, religion, mythology, history, literature and films are also untouched by it
 nepal ke pahari ilaakon main brahman evam kshetreey samudaay main raksha bandhan guru or bhaaginey ke haath se bandha jaataa he
 But Nepali Indians of Indian origin living in the south border tie rakhi to sister like Indians
 is din bahanen apane bhai ke daayen haath par raakhi baandhakar uske maathe par tilak karti hai or uski deergh aayu kii kaamana karti hai
 In return, the brother promises to protect them
 aisa mana jaataa he ki raakhi ke rangabirange dhaage bhai-bahan ke pyaar ke bandhan ko majboot karte he
 The siblings feed each other sweets and assure them to live together in happiness and sorrow
 yah ek aisa paavan parv he jo bhai-bahan ke pavitra rishte ko puraa aadar or sammaan detaa he
 Besides emotional siblings, many emotional relationships are also tied to this festival which are beyond the boundaries of religion, caste and country
 rakshabandhan kaa parv bharat ke raashtrapati or pradhanmantri ke nivas par bhi manaaya jaataa he
 Where little children go and tie a rakhi to them
 rakshabandhan atmiyata or sneh ke bandhan se rishton ko majbooti pradaan karne kaa parv he
 This is the reason that on this occasion, there is a trend to tie up defense not only to sister and brother but also in other relationships
 guru shishy ko rakshasutra bandhta he to shishy guru ko
 In India, in ancient times, when a graduate left the Gurukul after completing his education, he tied the Rakshatutra to get the blessing of the Acharya while the Acharya tied the Rakshatutra to his student with the wish that he had acquired the knowledge He should use it properly in his future life so that he can protect his knowledge as well as the dignity of Acharya
 Have it isi parampara ke anuroop aaj bhi kisi dharmik vidhi vidhaan se purv purohit yajmaan ko rakshasutra bandhta he or yajmaan purohit ko
 In this way, the two bind each other in their bonds to protect each other's honor
 rakshabandhan parv saamaajik or paariwarik ekbaddhata yaa ekasutrata kaa saanskrithik upaay rahaa he
 After marriage, the sister goes to a strange home

 panini ne sanskrit bhashaa ke tatkaaleen swaroop ko parishkrut evam niyamit karne ke uddeshy se bhashaa ke vibhinn avyavon evam ghatakon yatha dhwani-vibhaag, naam, pad, aakhyaat, kriya, upsarg, avyay, vaakya, ling ityadi tathaa unke antarsambandhon kaa samavesh ashtaadhi main kiya he
 Ashtadhyayi has 32 footers which are equally divided into eight chapters
 vyakaran ke is mahneey granth me panini ne vibhakti-pradhan sanskrit bhashaa ke vishaal kalevar kaa samgr evam sampoorn vivechan lagbhag 4000 sutron main kiya he, jo aath adhyyon main vibhajit hai
 Keeping in mind the misbehavior of writing material in the society then, Panini has taken the help of sutra style to make the grammar memorable
 punah, vivechan ko atishay sankshipt banane hetu panini ne apane purvavarti vaiyakarnon se praapt upkarnon ke saath-saath swayan bhi anek upkarnon kaa prayog kiya he jiname shivasutra yaa maheshwar sutara sabase mahatvapurn hai
 The origin of the Maheshwar Sutras is attributed to the Tandava dance performed by Lord Nataraja
 arthath:-"nrity ke avsaan par nataraj ne sanakaadi rishiyon kii siddhi or kaamana kaa uddhaar ke liye navpanch baar damru bajaayaa
 In this way, this web of fourteen Shivasutras appeared
 " Playing the fourteen times of Damru produced sounds in the form of fourteen sutras, the grammar was revealed by these sounds
 isaliye vyakaran sutron ke aadi-pravartak bhagwaan nataraj ko mana jaataa he
 Fame is that Maharishi Panini received these sutras with the blessings of Devadhidev Shiva which formed the basis of Paninian Sanskrit grammar

 The 14 sutras mentioned above combine the characters of the Sanskrit language in a specific way
 faltah, panini ko shabdon ke nirvachan yaa niyamon me jab bhi kinhi vishesh varna samoohon ke prayog kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, ve un varnon ko maheshwar sutron se pratyaahaar banaakar sankshep me grahan karte hai

 Pratyahara means short statement
 ashtaadhi ke pratham adhyay ke pratham paad ke 71wein sutara ‘adirantyen saheta’ sutara dwaara pratyaahaar banane kii vidhi kaa panini ne nirdesh kiya he
 Adirantyen Saheta: The Adi Varna creates a pratyahar with the last Varna Varna, which gives a comprehensive understanding of the Adi Varna and the pre-conscious Varna Varna
 udhaaharan: ach = pratham maheshwar sutara ‘aiun’ ke aadi varna ‘a’ ko chaturth sutara ‘aiuch’ ke antim varna ‘ch’ se yoga karaane par ach pratyaahaar banataa he
 This good pratyahar makes sense of all the letters from its initial letter 'A' to the one who comes before it

 isi tarah hal pratyaahaar kii siddhi 5wein sutara haywarat ke aadi akshar ha ko antim 14 wein sutara hal ke antim akshar l ke saath milaane se hoti he
 As a result, uparyukt sabhi 14 sutron main antim varna ko panini ne it kii sangya di he
 Since it is a noun, these last characters are used only for contract to make pratyahar, but they are not counted in the grammatical process i

 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice that proclaims that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages such as 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow them, allowing each person to attain the Hayat and finally the success

 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance

 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness

 Specific description of particles in statistical mechanics is called particle statistics
 bhautikee main mukhya rup se teen prakaar kii sankhyikee kaa upyog hota he
 Current Statistics, bose-einstein and fermi-dirac Statistics
 chirasmat sankhyikee , The Bose – Einstein and Fermi – Dirac statistics types are also collectively called quantum statistics, because in these we study the properties of complex communities by quantum theory
 kwantum sankhyikee ke avishkaar ke purv chirsammat sankhyikee se hi yah kaary liya jaataa tha or isamen paryaapt safalataa bhi milti thi
 But in the long run, there were some inventions related to special heat at low temperature, radiation of black object, which could not explain the classical physics properly
 is prakaar kwantum siddhant kaa janm hua
 The invention of quantum statistics, India's renowned scientist S
 N
 Bose did this in 1924 when he first formulated Planck's radiation law in a statistical manner
 gasiy samudaay ke liye isi niyam kaa prasar karte hue oinstin ne bose-oinstin sankhyikee naamak siddhant kaa moulik rup se pratipaadan kiya
 In 1924, Fermi and Dirac independently laid the foundation for fermi-dirac statistics, based on Pauli's exclusion principle
 samaan kanon ke kisi samudaay main siddhantat: kan kan main antar kar paanaa asambhav he, isliye samudaay kaa tarangafalan kinhin do kanon ke nirdeshaanko main samamit athwa asamamit hona chahie
 This has many effects, such as exchange action, which is responsible for iron magnetization and anti-methylation in certain metals
 vibhinn kanon ko do shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he jisase ek prakaar ke samaan kanon kaa samudaay bose-oinstin-sankhyikee ke anusaar hoga or duusare prakaar ke samaan kanon kaa vyavhaar fermi-dirack-sankhyikee par aadhaarit hoga
 All the translucent nuclei that have a codename pair, the bose-einstein-statistic include K-mesan), etc
, and those that have a codified number, all behave according to the fermi-dirac-statistic
 seemaant dasha main fermi-dirack, bose-oinstin tathaa maxwell sankhyikee kaa vyavhaar ek samaan hota he
 How different are the properties of a community of inert similar particles from the properties of an ideal gas, iskaa anumaan hamen p=nh3 / g se miltaa he
 In this formula, the code of m particle, n is the number of particles in a cubic even, h Planck constant, k Boltzmann constant, t community ultimate temperature and g we call the weight factor whose value is two for electrons and three for mesons
 yadi p kaa maan ek se kam he to gas kaa vyavhaar adarsh gas ke samaan hota he
 The maximum value of p for Bose gas is 2
612 and such a gas is said to be completely inductive
 yah bose-istin saghanan kriya se sabandhit he, jo drav hilium main 2
19 param taap par hota he
 Some properties of this fluid at a lower temperature than this ultimate temperature are very amazing, such as hyperthermia
 He3, jo fermi-dirack-sankhyikee kaa paripaalan karata he, He4 kii tarah shunya param taap tak drav hi rahata he or 0
08 param taap tak atitaral nahin banataa
 These two liquids are called quantum liquids
 fermi-dirack sakhyikee main jab p ek se bahut adhik bada hota he, tab gas purnataya apikrusht kehalaati he
 The conduction electrons in metals form inert gas
 dhaatuon ke vaidyut or ushmiya gun isi vidhi se bhalee bhanti samajhaae ja sakate he
 From the above formula it is clear that a gas behaves at ordinary temperature according to the Maxwell statistic, but as its temperature decreases and its pressure increases, the value of p increases and the gas becomes quantum
 
 ek vishesh shrenee ke taron kaa ghanatv, jinhen hwite dwarf taare kehete hai, bahut hi adhik hota he 
 The behavior of the matter of such stars is completely according to the fermi-dirac-statistic
 pehle bose tathaa fermi sankhyikee kaa keval un gaison ke gunon ke adhyayan ke liye prayog kiya gaya jinke kanon main koi aakarshak shakti nahin he or jinke kan kaa maan shunya he
 But later, with the help of quantum statistics, even gases whose particles have some attraction power and whose particles are like hard spheres
 aaj hamen kwantum sankhyikee dwaara ninn taap par dhaatuon ke gunon ke vishay main pehle se kahin adhik gyaan he; udhaahrant;, atichaalakata ke vishay main
 Hopefully in the next few years we will be able to make even more progress on this path
