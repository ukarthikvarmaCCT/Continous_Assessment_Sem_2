 And their answers are given
 ise ‘prashnkaal’ kaha jaataa he
 In addition, ministers are also tested by asking investigative and supplementary questions to see how much they understand the functioning of their departments
 prashnkaal sansad kii kaarywahiyon kaa sabase adhik dilachasp ang he
 No other work for the newspapers for the people and for the members themselves generates as much interest as the question hour produces
 is kaal ke dauraan sadan kaa vaataavaran anishchit hota he
 Sometimes a whirlwind of tension arises, sometimes it starts saying
 kabhi kabhi kisi prashn par hone vaale katu tark-vitark se uttejnaa paidaa hoti he
 Such a situation is overcome by the reaction and humor of the members or ministers
 yahi kaaran he ki prashnkaal ke dauraan na keval sadan kaksh balki darshak evam press gailariyaan bhi sadaa lagbhag bhari rahati hai
 Some questions are given an oral answer
 inhen tarankit prashn kaha jaataa he
 Unstarred questions are given written answers
 yah baat nishchit rup se kahi ja sakati he ki sadsy prashn poochne ke adhikaar kaa prayog karne main baari ruchi dikhaate rahe hai
 Since the process of questions is relatively simple and easy
 at: yah sansadeey prakriya ke anya upayon kii tulana main sansad sadasyon main adhikadhik priy hoti ja rahi he
 In both the houses of Parliament, the time immediately after the Question Hour is commonly known as 'zero Hour' or Zero Hour
 yah ek se adhik arthon main shoonyakaal hota he
 The noon time at 12 o'clock is neither the pre-noon time nor the post-midday time
 ‘shoonyakaal’ 12 baje prarambh hone ke kaaran is naam se janaa jaataa he ise ‘aavar’ bhi kaha gaya kyonki pehle ‘shoonyakaal’ puure ghante tak chalata tha, arthath 1 baje din main sadan kaa din ke bhojan ke liye avkaash hone tak
 No one can say what matter arises during this period or what kind of attack should be made on the government
 niyamon main ‘shoonyakaal’ kaa kahin bhi koi ullekh nahin he
 At the end of the Question Hour, the members stand to raise such matters, which they feel that action cannot be delayed
 haalaanki is prakaar maamle uthaane ke liye niyamon main koi upbandh nahin he
 It seems that the idea behind this practice has been that such rules which are a hindrance for the members in raising matters of national importance or serious grievances of the people in the House immediately, are meaningless
 niyamon kii drushti se tathakthith ‘shoonyakaal’ ek aniyamitata he
 Since matters are taken up without permission or without prior notice, it wastes valuable time of the House
 isse sadan ke vidhaayi, vittiya or anya niyamit kaary kaa atikaraman hota he
 Now, on the basis of the information already given to some of the matters raised in the Zero Hour, with the permission of the Speaker, a list has also been started
 sansad ke donon sadanon ke niyamon main lok mahatv ke maamle bina deree ke or kai prakaar se uthaane kii vyavastha he
 The various processes available to each member are as follows: iske dwaara lok sabha ke niyamit kaam-kaaj ko rokkar tatkaal mahatvuparn maamle par charchaa karai ja sakati he
 Through this, any member can bring the attention of the government to the matter of immediate importance
 mantri ko us maamle main bayaan dena hota he
 Each member who calls attention has the right to ask a question
 inke dwaara tatkaal mahatv ke prashnon par ek ghante kii charchaa kii ja sakati he
 However, there is no voting on it
 hamaare nirvaachit pratinidhi kis tarah aise maamle uthaane kaa prayaas karte hai jinka niyamon evam viniyamon kii vyakhya se koi sambandh nahin hota
 But these cases are provoking him and the people of his constituency at that time
 jo maamle vyavastha ke prashn nahin hote yaa jo prashnon, alp-soochna prashnon, dhyanakarshan prastaavon aadi se sambandhit niyamon ke adheen nahin uthaae ja sakate, ve iske adheen uthaae jate hai
 The House makes a number of decisions on various matters of public importance and expresses its opinion
 koi bhi sadsy ek prastaav ke rup main koi suzav sadan ke samaksh rakh saktaa he
 In which his opinion or wish has been given
 yadi sadan use sweekaar kar letaa he to vah samooche sadan kii raay yaa ichha ban jaati he
 In the end, the 'proposal' is broadly brought before the House to know the decision of the House
 prastaav vastav main sansadeey kaarywahi kaa aadhaar hote hai
 Any matter of public importance can be the subject of a motion
 prastaav bhinn bhinn sadasyon dwaara bhinn bhinn prayojanon se pesh kiye ja sakate hai
 The proposals can be moved by ministers and also by non-government members
 gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon dwaara pesh kiye jane vaale prastaavon kaa uddeshy saamanytah kisi maamle par sarkaar kii raay yaa vichaar jaananaa hota he
 The resolution is also a procedural measure, it is available to members and ministers to raise a discussion in the House on a matter of common interest
 saamaanya rup ke prastaavon ke samaan sankalp, raay yaa sifarish kii ghoshnaa ke rup main ho saktaa he
 Or in any other form as the Speaker may deem appropriate
 mantriparishad tab tak padasin rahati he jab tak use lok sabha kaa vishwaas praapt ho
 The government has to resign constitutionally as soon as the Lok Sabha expresses distrust in the Council of Ministers
 niyamon main is aashay kaa ek prastaav pesh karne kaa upbandh he jise ‘avishvaas prastaav’ kaha jaataa he
 The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to consider a motion of no confidence
 ninda prastaav avishvaas ke prastaav se bhinn hota he
 The motion of no-confidence does not mention the reasons on which it is based
 parantu ninda prastaav main aise kaarnon yaa aaropon kaa ullekh karnaa aavashyak hota he
 The proposal is intended to condemn the government for certain policies and actions
 ninda prastaav mantriparishad ke viruddh yaa kisi ek mantri ke viruddh yaa kuch mantriyon ke viruddh pesh kiya jaataa he
 It expresses regret, indignation or surprise by the House over the failure of any minister or ministers
 sarkaar ko shashan, suraksha or jan kalyaan ke bahut se kaam karne hote hai
 All this requires a lot of resources
 ye aaen kahan se? sarkaar janata se kar vasuulati he
 It also takes loans when needed
 kyonki ham sansadeey vyavastha main rahete hai, sarkaar ke liye yah jaruri he ki koi bhi kar lagane yaa koi bhi kharchaa karne se pehle vah sansad kii manjuuri le
 In order to get this approval, every year the government presents a budget i
e
 the full year income and expenditure accounts in Parliament
 rail bajet or saamaanya bajet alag alag pesh kiye jate hai
 The general budget is usually brought on the last working day of February
 rail bajet usase kuch din pehle aa jaataa he
 The financial year begins at the first April of each year at this time
 bajet main is aashay kaa prastaav hota he ki aane vaale saal ke dauraan kis mad par kitna dhan kharch kiya janaa he
 How much money will come from it or from where it will be raised
 bajet ke aagaamee varsh ke liye anudaan die jate hai
 The government gets an opportunity to explain and explain its financial and economic policies and programs
 saath hi, sansad ko un par vichaar karne or unki aalochana karne kaa bhi avasar miltaa he
 In the process of passing the budget, serious and full discussion takes place in both houses of Parliament
 yah bajet pesh kiye jane ke kuch din baad hoti he
 The discussion begins with a general debate
 yah sansad ke donon sadanon main teen yaa chaar din tak chalati he
 The practice is that at this stage the members consider only the general aspects of the government's fiscal and economic policies
 kar lagane tathaa kharch ke byore main nahin jate
 Thus, the General Debate gives each House an opportunity to express its views
 sarkaar ko bhi abhas ho jaataa he ki kisi prastaav vishesh ke prati baad kii avasthaaon main kya pratikriya hogi
 It is to be noted that the Rajya Sabha has nothing to do with the budget other than general discussion
 maangon par matdaan keval lok sabha main hota he
 The second stage is to discuss and vote on the demands for grants
 saamanytah prayek mantralay ke liye prastaavit anudaanon ke liye alag maange rakhi jaati hai
 These 'demands' are related to the expenditure part of the budget
 inkaa swaroop karypalika dwaara lok sabha ke liye kiye gaye nivedan kaa he ki maangi gai raashi ko kharch karne kaa adhikaar diya jaae
 Discussion on demands is interesting
 charchaa ke dauraan mantralay kii nitiyon or kriyakalapon kii baariki se chaanbin kii jaati he
 Members may do so by presenting supporting proposals for the original proposal for demands for grants
 in sahaayak prastaavon ko sansadeey bhashaa main ‘katautee prastaav’ kaha jaataa he
 The process of passing the budget, from the presentation of the budget, goes on to discuss it and accept the demands for grants and till the passing of appropriations and finance bills, usually after the commencement of the current financial year
 jab tak sansad, maangen sweekrut nahin kar leti tab tak ke liye yah aavashyak he ki desh kaa prashasan chalaane ke liye sarkaar ke paas paryaapt dhan uplabdh ho
 Therefore, special provision has been made for 'vote on Account'
 jiske dwaara loksabhaa ko shakti di gai he ki vah bajet kii prakriya puri hone tak kisi vittiya varsh ke ek bhaag ke liye peshgi anudaan de sakati he
 Legislation is considered to be the primary function of Parliament
 iske liye pahal adhikanshtah karypalika dwaara kii jaati he
 The government makes legislative proposals
 us par charchaa tathaa vaad vivaad ke pashchaat sansad us par anumodan kii apni muhar lagaati he
 All legal proposals are introduced in Parliament in the form of a Bill
 vidheyak vidhaayi prastaav kaa masauda hota he
 The Bill can be introduced in any one House of Parliament by the Government or by a non-official member
 is prakaar mote taur par, vidheyak do prakaar ke hote hai: sarkari vidheyak or gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon ke vidheyak
 Most bills taking the form of legislation are government bills
 vaise to gaiyr sarkari sadasyon ke bahut kam vidheyak vidhi kaa rup lete hai
 Nevertheless, it is brought to their notice by the government and people that there is a need to amend the existing law or make any necessary legislation
 vidheyak kaa masauda us vishay se sambandhit sarkaar ke mantralay main vidhi mantralay kii sahaayta se taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 After approval of the Cabinet, it is brought before the Parliament
 sambandhit mantri dwaara use sansad ke donon sadanon main se kisi bhi sadan main pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Only in case of money bill it is prohibited that it cannot be introduced in Rajya Sabha
 adhinium kaa rup lene se purv vidheyak ko sansad main vibhinn avasthaaon se guzarana padataa he
 Each Bill has three promises in each House
 arthath pehla vaachan, doosraa vaachan or teesraa vaachan
 The introduction of the Bill is the first reading of the Bill
 pratha ke anusaar is avasthaa main charchaa nahin kii jaati he
 The second reading of the Bill is the most elaborate and important stage because it is examined in detail and closely
 jab vidheyak ke sabhi khando par or anusoochiyon par, yadi koi hon, sadan vichaar kar unhen sweekrut kar letaa he
 The minister can then propose that the bill be passed
 yah teesraa vaachan kehalaata he
 After it is passed in the House in which the Bill is introduced, it is sent to another House for concurrence
 vahaan vidheyak phir in teenon avasthaaon main se gujarata he
 An extraordinary situation arises when there is a deadlock due to disagreement between the two on a bill
 jiskaa samaadhaan donon sadanon kii sanyukt baithak main hota he
 When a bill is passed separately or jointly by both the Houses, it is sent to the President
 yadi raashtrapati anumati pradaan kar detaa he to anumati kii tithi se vidheyak adhinium ban jaataa he
 Changes can be made in any Article of the Constitution by amendment
 kintu ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirnay ke anusaar samvidhan ke mul dhaanche yaa mul tatwon ko nasht yaa nune karne vaala koi parivartan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Parliamentary privileges are the exclusive rights that both houses of parliament, its members and committees enjoy
 visheshadhikaar is drushti se die jate hai ki sansad ke donon sadan, uski samitiyaan or sadsy swatantra rup se kaam kar saken
 Their dignity remains, but this does not mean that the status of privileged members is different from that of ordinary citizens in the eyes of the law
 jahaan tak vidhiyon ke lagu hone kaa sambandh he, sadsy logon ke pratinidhi hone ke saath saath saadhaaran naagarik bhi hote hai
 The basic law is that all citizens, including Members of Parliament, should be treated equally in the eyes of the law
 jo daayitv anya nagarikon ke hon, vahi unke bhi hote hai or shaayad sadsy hone ke naate kuch adhik hote hai
 The most important prerogative of the Parliament is the freedom of the House and its Committees to present their views with complete independence
 sansad ke kisi sadsy dwaara kahi gai kisi baat yaa die gaye kisi mat ke sambandh main uske viruddh kisi nyaayalay main koi kaarywahi nahin kii ja sakati
 Lists of parliamentary privileges can be prepared
 vastav main ye taiyaar bhi kii gayi hai parantu aisi koi bhi suchi puri nahin he
 In a small way one can say that any work which obstructs the work of the House, its committees or its members in any way violates the parliamentary privilege
 udhaaharan ke liye, koi sadsy na keval us samay giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa jabaki us sadan kaa, jiskaa ki vah sadsy ho, adhiveshan chal rahaa ho yaa jabaki us sansadeey samiti kii, jiskaa vah sadsy ho, baithak chal rahi ho, yaa jabaki donon sadanon kii sanyukt baithak chal rahi ho, yaa jabaki donon sadanon kii sanyukt baithak chal rahi ho
 He cannot be arrested even 40 days before the commencement of the session of Parliament and 40 days after the expiry of it or even when he is coming to the House or going outside the House
 sansad ke parisaron ke bheetar, adhyaksh / sabhapati kii anumati ke bina, divaani yaa aapraadhik koi kanoonee ‘saman’ nahin die ja sakate hai
 No one can be arrested inside the Parliament House without the permission of the Speaker / Chairman
 kyonki sansad ke parisaron main keval sansad ke sadan ke yaa adhyaksh / sabhapati ke adeshon kaa paalan hota he
 Here no other governmental authority or local administration orders are followed
 sansad kaa prayek sadan apane visheshadhikaar kaa swayan hi rakshak hota he
 a person may be punished by breach of privilege or contempt of the House by condemning or punishing him or by imprisonment for a prescribed period
 swayan apane sadasyon ke maamle main sadan anya do prakaar ke dand de saktaa he, arthath sadan kii seva se nilambit karnaa or nikaal dena, kisi sadsy ko ek nirdhaarit avadhi ke liye sadan kii seva se nilambit kiya ja saktaa he
 Can be removed from the House in a very serious matter
 sadan aparaadhiyon ko aisi avadhi ke liye karawas kaa dand de saktaa he jo saadharantah sadan ke adhiveshan kii avadhi se adhik nahin hoti
 The prisoner is freed as soon as the house is prorogued
 darshakon dwaara gailaree main naare lagaakar or / athwa ishtihaar phenkakar sadan kii avmaananaa karne ke kaaran, donon sadanon ne, samay samay par, aparaadhiyon ko sadan ke us din sthagit hone tak karawas kaa dand diya he
 The penal area of the House is not confined to its Houses and the crimes committed before them and applies to all the contempt of the House
 chaahe avmaananaa sadasyon dwaara kii gai ho yaa aise vyaktiyon dwaara jo sadsy na hon
 It also makes no difference whether the crime is committed within the House or outside its premises
 sadan kaa visheshadhikaar bhang karne yaa uski avmaananaa karne ke kaaran vyaktiyon ko dand dene kii sadan kii yah shakti sansadeey visheshadhikaar kii neenv he
 There has also been a tradition of the House that the regret expressed expressly and unconditionally by persons guilty of breach of privilege of the House or contempt of the House is accepted by the House
 aise main saadharantah sadan apni garima ko dekhte hue aise maamalon par aage kaarywahi na karne kaa faisla karata he
 Members of both the Houses are entitled to such salaries and allowances as the Parliament may decide from time to time by law
 sansad ne sansad sadsy adhinium ke adheen sadasyon ko pension die jane kii sweekruti di he

 Martin Luther King or 'martin Luther King Jr
' is a different person
 martin luther isaai dharm main protestwad naamak sudharatmak aandolan chalaane ke liye vikhyath hai
 He was a German monk, theologian, university professor, pastor and church reformer whose ideas led to the Protestism Reform movement that changed the course of development of Western Europe
 luther kaa janm germany kii islevan naamak nagari main hua tha
 His father was a laborer of Hans Luther Khan, who had a total of eight children in his family and Martin was his second child
 attharah varsh kii avasthaa main martin luther erfurt ke nae vishvavidhyalay main bharti hue or san 1505 main unhen em
e
 kii oopaadhi mili
 After this, he started studying law according to his father's will, but considering a risk in his life in a severe storm, he vowed to retire
 iske falswaroop vah san 1505 main hi sant agastin ke sanyasiyon ke dharmasangh ke sadsy bane or 1507 i
 main unhen purohit kaa abhishek diya gaya
 Luther's officer sent him to the University of Wittenberg for the purpose of becoming president of his union, where Luther received his doctorate in theology in 1512 AD
 usee vishvavidhyalay main vah bible ke professor bane or saath saath apane sangh ke prantiy adhikari ke pad par bhi niyukt hue
 Luther soon began to interpret the Bible based on personal spiritual experiences in his lectures
 us samay unke ant:karan main gahari ashaanti vyaapt thi
 Finding himself incapable of fulfilling the ordinances ordained by God, he began to teach that human nature was completely distorted due to Adipaap
 carch kii paramparaagat shiksha yah thi ki baptism dwaara manushya adipaap se mukt ho jaataa he kintu luther kii dharna thi ki baptism sanskaar ke baad bhi manushya paapi hi rah jaataa he or dharmik kaaryon dwaara koi bhi punya nahin arjeet kar sata at: use isa par bharosa rakhana chahie
 a sinful human being, as a result of a full surrender to Jesus, becomes a blessing to God even when he is a sinner
 ye vichaar carch kii shiksha ke anukool nahin the kintu san 1517 i tak luther ne khulmakhulla carch ke prati vidroh kiya
 To understand the events of 1517, it is necessary to understand the theology of "dandamochan"
 carch kii tatsambandhi paramparaagat shiksha is prakaar he - sachche papasvikaar dwaara paap kaa aparaadh kshamaa kiya jaataa he
 But not all the consequences of sin are destroyed
 uske parinaam dur karne ke liye manushya ko tapasya karnaa athwa dand bhogana padataa he
 The church can help a sinner to overcome those consequences of sin
 vah uske liye prarthana kar saktaa he or isa or apane punya falon ke bhandar main se kuch ansh paapi ko pradaan kar saktaa he
 That support of the church is called Indulgance or Dandamochan
 paapi koi "dandamochan" tabhi mil saktaa he jab vah paap sweekaar karne ke baad paap ke aparaadh se mukt ho chukaa ho tathaa us dandamochan ke liye carch dwaara tehraaya hua punya kaa kaary puraa kare
 In 1517 AD, a special chastisement was announced in favor of those who supported the construction of Rome's Saint Peter the Great Temple
 us dandamochan kii ghoshnaa karanevaale kuch upadeshak paap ke liye pashchaattap karne kii aavashyaktaa par kam bal dete the or rupaya ikattha karne kaa adhik dhyaan rakhte the
 Luther rebelled against the same sentencing
 unhone dandamochan vishyak durupyog kii ninda hi nahin kii, dandamochan ke siddhant kaa bhi virodh karte hue vah khullamakhulla sikhalaane lage ki carch athwa pope paap ke parinaamon se chhutkaaraa de hi nahin sakate, isa maatr de sakate hai
 Jesus does not punish people who hate their sins because of their own merit, but because of their mercy
 rome kii ore se luther se anurodh hua ki vah dandamochan ke vishay main apni shiksha waapas le kintu luther ne aisa karne se inkaar kiya or teen nai rachanaaon main apni dharanaon ko spasht kar diya
 He opposed the authority of Rome and the practice of priests being unmarried, Christianity accepted no other basis except the Bible, and accepted only three sacraments, namely, baptism, sin, and the Eucharist
 uttar main rome ne san 1520 i
 main katholic carch se luther ke bahishkaar kii ghoshnaa kii
 From that time onwards Luther began to lead his new sect
 san 1524 i
 main unhone catherine bora se vivaah kiya
 His movement was not free from the feeling of German nationality and he received the support of most of the German rulers
 sambhavat: is kaaran se unhone apane sampradaay kaa sanghathan jarurat se adhik shaskaon par chhod diya
 When the Catholic Emperor Charles v requested the Lutheran rulers to allow the Catholic Christians of their territories to perform public worship, the Lutheran rulers sent an intense counter-protest to the emperor in protest of the proposal and the emperor had to bow down
 is pratwaad ke kaaran us nae dharm kaa naam protestat rakhaa gaya tha
 Luther's place is very important in the history of Western Christianity
 roman katholic carch ke prati unke vidroh ke falswaroop yadhyapi paashchaatya isai sampradaay kii ekta shatabdiyon ke liye chhin bhinn ho gai thi or aaj tak aisi hi he kintu isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki luther asaadhaaran pratibhasampann vyakti the jinhone sachche dharmik bhaavon se prerit hokar vidroh kii aawaaj uthaai thi
 Luther's importance in the field of language is also unique
 unhone german bhashaa main bahut se bhavpurn bhajanon kii rachana kii tathaa bible kaa german anuwaad bhi prastut kiya jisase aadhunik german bhashaa par luther kii amit chhap he
 After his separation from the Catholic Church, Luther spent much of his life in Wittenberg where he lectured at the university and created a majority of his works on theology and the Bible
 san 1546 i
 main vah kisi vivaad kaa samaadhaan karne ke uddeshy se mansfeld gaye the or vahaan se lautate hue vah apane janmasthan icelyban main hi chal based
 At the time of his death, all Germany except Westphalia, Rheinlad and Bavaria was in the hands of the Lutheran rulers
 iske atirikt luutherwaad germany ke nikatavarti deshon main bhi fail gaya tathaa scandinavia ke samast isai lutheran ban gaye the
 Nowadays, twenty-nine percent of all Protestat religions, including the Anglican community, are Lutherans
 luutherwaad kaa pradhan centre germany hi he jahaan baawan pratishat log lutheran hai
 More than ninety percent of people in Scandinavian countries are followers of the same religion, there are about ten million Lutherans in other nearby countries of Germany, with a figure of six million in North America
 iske atirikt lutheranon ne brijil, chotanagpur aadi kai mishan kshetron main safaltaapurvak apane mat kaa prachaar kiya he

 The doctrine of libertarianism has developed after World War II in response to the increased role of the state under the insistence of philanthropy in capitalist countries
 swatantraavaad manushya or samaaj ke jivan main rajya kii bhoomika ko behad simit kar dena chahta he
 It has two major branches
 ek shakha araajaktaavaadiyon kii he jo maanate hai ki sarkaar apane aap main vaid sanstha he hi nahin
 The second branch is that of the Neutralists who believe that the government has the right to do minimum work including police-protection, implementation of contracts, civil and criminal courts
 lekin adhiktar nunetamavaadi yah bhi maanate hai ki unki suchi main kar vasuulne kaa adhikaar shaamil nahin he
 Even to complete the work mentioned above, the government should not take tax from the people
 araajaktaavaadiyon kaa khyaal he ki cricket ke nitwachaman kism kaa yah rajya bhi kuch zyaada hi vyapak he
 They believe that the work given by the minimalists to the government should also be done by private agencies
 kuch araajaktaavaadi to vyakti kii suraksha ke liye bhi sarkaar ko kisi tarah kii shakti kaa upbhog nahin karne dena chaahate
 Libertarians emphasize the idea of self-ownership or 'self-respect'
 aatm-swaamitv kaa vichaar kaant dwaara logon ko apane-aap main saadhy maanane ke sutara kaa hi ek rup he
 This means that every person is his own master
 isliye uski zindagi main kisi ko bhi aisa dabil dene kii zarurat nahin hai jisase uske aatm- swaamitv kaa ulanghan hota ho
 On this basis also, libertarianism is divided into two streams: first, right-wing libertarianism and second, left-wing libertarianism
 dakshinpanthi swatantraaavaadi nunatam rajya kii avadharana kaa samarthak he
 He believes that a person has the right to unlimited property
 yadi rajya vyakti par kisi bhi tarah kaa kar lagaataa he to vah aatm-swaamitv ke usul kaa ulanghan hoga
 Its formulas can be found in Locke's ideas
 binsavi sadi main haayak or freedman ne bhi is vichaar kaa samarthan kiya he
 American economist Murray N
 among the leading scholars who gave intellectual support to this movement after World War II
 The name Rothbird is also prominent
 rothbird ne a-hastkshepkaaree rajya ke siddhant ko maanavadhikaron ke aseemvaadi sanskaran se jod kar rajya ko kaarij kar diya
 Robert Nozick is the greatest proponent of this among contemporary scholars
 duusari ore, vam-swatantraavaad kii bhi ek lambi parampara rahi he
 Left-libertarians draw inspiration from the ideas of eighteenth and nineteenth century thinkers, such as Thomas Penn, Henry George, and Peter Walrus
 aajkal helel steenar or peter velentine jaise vichaarkon ne iskaa samarthan kiya he
 Left-libertarianism also emphasizes self-ownership
 vah maanata he ki sampattiheen logon ko aatm-swaamitv kaa adhikaar dene ke liye yaa to sansadhano kaa rashtriyakaran kiya janaa chahie, yaa phir sabhi logon tak inaki pahunch sunishchit kerani chahie
 At present, right-wing-libertarianism is dominated only by the name of libertarianism
 1974 main darshanik rabart nozic kii kriti 'anarki, state and utapia' ke prakaashan ke baad is andolan par kaafii academy dhyaan diya gaya
 This book came to light in the 1971 publication of John Rawls's a Theory of Justice
 apni kitaab main nozic yah tark dete hai ki rajya ko sirf suraksha or nyaay ke kaam karne chahie nyaay ke is siddhant ke tahat mana jaataa he ki logon kii visheshtaon kaa dhyaan rakhte hue ek khaas tareeke se sampatti or aay kaa vitaran kiya janaa chahie
 Nozick has shown by the example of noted basketball player Wilt Chamberlain how small activities violate personal freedom
 nozic kehete hai ki agar chemberlen ko basketbaal kaa khel dikhaane ke liye ek samtawadi samaaj main sabhi log apane ek dollar kaa chauthai hissaa den to uske paas bahut zyaada sampatti jamaa ho jaaegi
 The Nazis adopt historical principles instead to avoid problems of pattern-based justice
 unhone lock ke varnan ko apane is aitihaasik siddhant kaa aadhaar banaaya he
 According to him, it is not necessary that the person is morally fit for his property
 isaki jagah vyakti sampatti kaa sirf hakdaar ho saktaa he
 a person can be entitled to property only if he has justly acquired an unclaimed item; Or he may have taken property from someone who had a just initial takeover
 saath hi, nozic ateet ke anyaayon ke parishodhan kii vyavastha bhi karte hai
 That is, if the property has not been acquired according to the above-mentioned process, then the person can claim amortization for it
 apni kitaab main nozic yah bhi dikhaane kii koshish karte hai ki ek swatantraaavaadi samaaj utapian saamaajik vyavastha kii sabase susangat paribhaasha par khara utarataa he
 In addition, scholars like David Gauthier have advocated libertarianism on the basis of mutual benefit
 duusari ore, bahut se vidwaanon ne swatantraaa ko zyaada-se- zyaada badhaane ko tark ke aadhaar par bhi swatantraavaad kii vakaalat kii he
 The fundamental argument of the right-wing version of libertarianism is very weak
 yah samaaj main sampatti or sansadhano kii asamanta ko jyon kaa tyon sweekaar kar letaa he
 Nozick's theory does not attempt to answer the question of whether the big capitalists in the present era had acquired their property according to the principle of equitable acquisition
 isi tarah isamen yah bhi spasht nahin he ki kya sabhi logon ko shuruaati rup se samaan sansaadhan diye gayi the? yadi aisa nahin hua to sampattiheen or saadhanheen logon ko sansadhano ke punarvitaran kii maang kyon nahin kerani chahie? yadhyapi vampanthi-swatantraavaad is tarah ke mudde uthaata he lekin dakshinpanthi-swatantraavaad kaa prabhaav lagaataar badhata gaya he
 The main reason for this is the failure of the philanthropic state

 yah prithvi ke sabase mahatvapurn chakron main ek he or jeevamandal tathaa uske samast jeevon ke saath carbon ke punarnavinikaran or punarupyog ko anumat karata he
 The carbon cycle was initially discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, and propounded by Humphrey Davy
 ab ise aam taur par vinimay margon dwaara jude paanch pramukh carbon bhandar ke rup main mana gaya he
 These stores are: carbon ke vaarshik sanchalan, bhandaron ke bich carbon vinimay, vibhinn rasinic, bhautik, bhuvaigyanik or jaivik prakriyaaon kii vajah se hote hai
 The largest active reservoir of carbon is near the sea near the Earth's surface, but the deep-sea portion of this reservoir does not rapidly exchange with the atmosphere
 vaishvik carbon bajet carbon bhandaron ke bich yaa carbon chakra ke ek vishisht chakra ke bich carbon ke vinimay kaa santulan he
 Testing the carbon budget of a reservoir or reservoir can provide information about whether the reservoir or reservoir is acting as a source of carbon dioxide or as a merger trough
 prithvi ke vayumandal main carbon mukhya rup se gasiy carbon dioxide ke rup main maujuud he
 Although it is a small percentage of the atmosphere, it plays an important role in supporting life
 vayumandal main maujuud carbon yukt anya gaisen hai methane or chlorophlorocarbon 
 vriksh prakaash sanshleshan ke dauraan, prakriya main oxigen ko chhodte hue, carbon dioxide ko carbohydrate main badalte hai
 This process occurs more in relatively new forests, where the growth of trees is even more rapid

 This is evident in the Keeling curve of measured CO 2 concentrations as an annual signal

 Carbon can be released into the atmosphere in several ways: lagbhag 42,000 gigaton carbon jeevamandal main maujuud he
 Carbon is an essential part of life on Earth
 yah sabhi jivit koshikaon kii sanrachana, jaev-rasayan or poshan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Otherwise, anoxic respiration occurs and releases methane into the surrounding environment, which eventually makes its way into the atmosphere or hydrosphere
 jeevamandal main carbon kaa bhandaaran vibhinn kaal-maanon main asankhya prakriyaaon dwaara prabhavit hota he: jabaki shuddh praathmik utpaadakta dainik or mausami chakra kaa anusaran karti he, carbon vrikshon par saikadon varsh or mitti main hazaron varshon tak sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus changes in those long-term carbon pools can affect global climate change

 Carbon is easily exchanged between the atmosphere and the ocean
 samudri urdhv-pravaahee kshetron main, carbon vayumandal main vimochit hota he
 Conversely, carbon in the downstream regions transfers from the atmosphere to the ocean
 jab CO2 samudr main pravesh karata he, vah silsilewar pratikriyaaon main bhaag letaa he, jo sthaneey rup se santulan main hai: Solution: carbonic amla main roopantaran: First ionization: dwitiya ynikaran: This set of reactions, each with its own equilibrium coefficient, determines the form of inorganic carbon in the oceans
 The experimentally determined coefficients for seawater are functions for the temperature, pressure, and other ions present
 mahaasaagar main santulan prabhaavshaalee rup se bicarbonate kaa paksh lete hai
 Since this ion is three phases away from atmospheric CO2, the storage level of inorganic carbon in the ocean is not a ratio of CO2 to the atmospheric partial pressure per unit
 samudr ke liye kaarak he das: arthath vayumandaleey CO2 main 10% vruddhi ke prati, samudri bhandaaran vruddhi lagbhag 1% hoti he, jahaan vaastavik ghatak sthaneey paristhitiyon par nirbhar hai
 This intermediate factor is often called the "revel factor" after Roger Revell

 samay ke saath ye carbonate avsaad chuunaa pathar banaate hai, jo carbon chakra main carbon kaa sabase bada bhandar he
 Fluid calcium in the oceans comes from the chemical weathering of calcium-silicate rocks, when carbonic and other acids in ground water react with calcium-rich minerals to release calcium ions in the solution and new aluminum-rich smooth mineral soils
 And the remains of indestructible mineral matter like crystalline are left behind

 The World Wide Web is a system of retrieving interconnected hypertext documents through the Internet
 ek web broujar kii sahaayta se ham un web pannon ko dekh sakate hai jinamein text, chhavi, video, envan anya multimedia hote hai tathaa hiserlink kii sahaayta se un pannon ke bich main avaagaman kar sakate he
 The World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners Lee in 1989 while working at the European Nuclear Research Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, and was released in 1992
 uske baad se barnars-lee nen web ke staron ke vikaas main ek sakriya bhoomika adaa kii he or haal ke varshon main unhonen cementic web viksit karne ke apane swapn kii vakaalat kii he
 Viewing a web page on the World Wide Web usually begins by typing its URL in a web browser or following a hyperlink to that page or resource
 tab us panne ko dhund kar prardashit karne ke liye web broujar andar hi andar sanchaar sandeshon kii ek shrinkhalaa aarambh karata he
 The server-named portion of the URL is first converted to an IP address with the help of a globally distributed Internet database, known as the Domain Name System
 web sarwar se sampark saadhane or data packet bhejne ke liye ye ypi pataa jaruri he
 The browser then requests the resource by sending a request for hypertext transfer protocol to that specific address of the web server
 ek aam web panne kii baat karen to, web broujar sabase pehle us panne ke ech
tii
em
el
 text ke liye anurodh karata he or tunrat hi uskaa padchhed kar detaa he
 The web browser then re-requests images and files that are part of that page
 ek website kii lokapriyata saamanyat: is baat se maapi jaati he ki kitni baar uske pannon ko dekha gaya yaa kitni baar uske sarwar ko hit kiya gaya yaa phir kitni baar uski sanchikaon ke liye anurodh kiya gaya
 After receiving the required files from the web server, the browser displays the page on the screen as instructed by HTML, cascading style sheets and other web languages
 jis web panne ko ham screen par dekhte hai uske nirmaan ke liye anya chhaviyon envan sansadhano kaa bhi istemaal hota he
 Most web pages will include hyperlinks to other pages related to them and perhaps downloadable content, source documents, definitions and other web resources
 is upyogi or sambandhit sansadhano ke samagam ko, jo kii aapas main hypertext link ke dwaara jude hue hon, ko jaankaree kaa "web" kaha gaya
 Tim Berners Lee was first named Worldwide Web in 1990 for making it available on the Internet
 web kii utpatti ke anternihit vichaaron ke lakshan 1980 main milane shuru ho gaye the jab sarn main tim barnars-lee nen ankvaiyar kii rachana kii thi, kii taraf tha jo unhonen bachapan main padhi thi
 Although it was different from the system used today, its original ideas were largely the same)
 march 1989 main tim barnars-lee nen ek prastaav likhaa jisamen ankvaiyar kaa zikr kiya gaya or ek adhik vistrut soochna pranali kaa varnan kiya gaya
 With the help of Robert Calleau, he published a more formal proposal of the World Wide Web on November 12, 1990
 iskaa adarsh namoona EBT ke DYNATEXT SGML reader, jise kii sarn dwaara anubandhit kiya gaya tha, dwaara pradaan kiya gaya tha
 EBT
 haalaanki ye DYNATEXT ke antargat SGML ISO 8879:1986 ke hypermedia main vistaar main iskaa mukhya yogadan tha) pranali kaaphi ucch takanic kii maani jaati thi, parantu ise bahut mahangaa samajha jaataa tha or HEP ke samaaj ke istemaal ke liye jo licencing niti thi use bhi anuchit samajha jaataa tha
 The Next Cube was used by berners-lee in 1990 to write the world's first web server, and the first web browser, the World Wide Web
 1990 ke christmas tak barnars-lee ne ek chaalu web ke liye aavashyak sabhi upkarnon kaa nirmaan kar liya tha:pehla web broujar, pehla web sevak or pratham web prishth jo is pariyojna kaa varnan karte the
 On 6 August 1991, he posted a brief summary of the World Wide Web project on the alt
hypertext newsgroup
 is tithi ko web ke internet par ek saarvajanik rup se uplabdh seva ke shuruyaat ke rup main bhi yaad kiya jaataa he
 The first server outside Europe was built in December 1991 at SLAC
 hypertext jaise mahatvapurn buniyadi vichaar kii utpatti 1960 kii puraani pariyojnaon se hi ho gai thi- ted nelson or andrius wain dame - ted nelson kii pariyojna zanadu or duglas engelbert kii on-line systams 
donon nelson or engelbert ko vannevar bush kii microfils par aadhaarit "memex " se prerana mili thi, jiskaa varnan 1945 ke ek niabandh main is prakaar kiya gaya tha " jaisaa ham sonchen "
 berners-lee's major success was the combination of Hypertext and Internet
 In his book Weaving the Web, he described how he repeatedly suggested to members of the two tech communities that the two technologies combine
 Maybe, but no one accepted his invitation and eventually he had to take a hand in the project
 web or anya jagahon par istemaal hone vaale sansadhano kii vishwa main ekmaatr pahchaan vaali pranali viksit kii: uniform risource abhigyapak
 The web had a lot of differences from other hypertext systems at the time
 web main do dishaao kii kadiyon kii bajaay keval ek disha vaali kadiyon kii aavashyaktaa thi
 If someone wants to join a resource, without the help of the owner of that resource, then it is also possible
 pehle kii pranaaliyon kii tulana main isane web brouzars or sarvaron ko lagu karne main aane vaali dikkaton ko kaaphi had tak kam kar diya
 But this in turn gave rise to a severe problem of link rot
 purvadhikaariyon, jaise kii hyper card, kii tulana main ye web gaiyr malikana tha
 This made it possible to develop servers and clients independently and add other extensions without license restrictions
 30 april 1993 ko sarn ne ghoshnaa kii ki vishwa vyapee web sabake liye nickshulk hoga or koi shulk bakaayaa nahin rahegaa
 With the announcement of the Gopher Protocol that its service is no longer free, the trend of people turned to the web rather than Gopher very quickly
 violawww ek shuruaati lokapriy web browsar tha, jo ki hyper card par aadhaarit tha
 Scholars generally agree that the new turning point in the life of the World Wide Web began in 1993 with the arrival of the Mosaic Web Browser, the development of this graphical browser by a team from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications of the University of Illinois at Urbana Schumpagn
 By Mark Andrissen

 It was one of several computing development programs initiated by Senator Al Gore

 Mosaic became by far the most popular Internet protocol because of its graphical user interface
 vishwa vyapee web sangh ke tim berners-lee dwaara oktober 1994 main europea sanghathan parmaanu anusandhan chhodane ke baad sthapit kiya gaya tha
 It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory of Computer Science with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency support - which started the Internet and the European Commission
 ghar main sthapit vaishvik soochna pranali kaa vichaar ko kam se kam isaac asimov kii march 1959 kii laghu kahani "aneverseri" ameging stories tak peeche khinchaa ja saktaa he
 In this, the characters obtain information through a home computer called a "multivac outlet"
 ye grah computer puure grah par faile circuits ke ek jaal dwaara ek mile lambey super computer se juda hua tha, jo kii prithvi ke andar kahin sthapit tha
 a character is thinking of establishing a multivac, junior model for his children

 Several formal standards and other technical characteristics define the operation of various aspects of the World Wide Web, Internet, and computer information exchange
 kai dastavejon ko vishwa vyapee web sangh ne barnars-lee ke netritv main banaaya he, lekin kuch anya ko internet ejineering task force or anya sanghathanon dwaara banaaya gaya he
 Generally, when web standards are discussed, the following publications are seen as basic: atirikt prakaashan vishwa vyapee web kii anya aavashyak takneekon kii paribhaasha pradaan karte hai, jinamein nimnlikhit shaamil hai: An important advancement in the field of web technology was the Java platform of Sun Microsystems
 isane web pannon ko chote prograamon kaha jaataa he) ko sidhe dikhne main sakasham banaaya
 These applets run on the end user's computer and provide a superior class of experience compared to web pages
 java ke graahakon ke liye jo applates the unhen anekon kaarnon se aashaa ke anuroop lokapriyata hasil nahin hui
 These reasons included the lack of integration with other elements, and the fact that many computers at that time were sent to the end customers without installing a proper Java virtual machine, which caused the user to download
 Applets used to appear
 adob flash ab un kaaryon ko karata he jinaki apeksha shuru main java applates se kii gai thi, jaise kii video saamagree, anemation, tathaa kuch utkrisht visheshtaon vaale GUI adi ko chalaanaa
swayan java kaa vyapak istemaal ab sarwar-said or anya programing ke liye uchit manch or bhashaa ke taur par hone laga he
 javascript, on the other hand, was a scripting language initially developed for use within web pages
 is manakikrut sanskaran he ECMA script 
jabaki iskaa naam java ke samaan he, javascript ko netscape dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha or java se iskaa koi lenaa dena nahin he, haalanki donon bhashaaon kii vaakya rachana ko c programing bhashaa se liya gaya he
 In combination with the Web page document object model, javascript has become a highly effective technique, even beyond its original creators' imagination
 ek panne ko uske istemaalkarta tak pahunchane ke baad bhi uske DOM main ched-chhaad karne ko gatisheel HTML kaha gaya, sthir HTML se rujhaan parivartan par jor dene ke liye aisa kiya gaya
 In normal cases, all optional information and tasks that are available on a web page with javascript are downloaded as soon as the page is first accessed
 AJAX antarmishrit web vikaas kii takneekon kaa ek samooh he jiskaa upyog interective web anuprayogon ke vikaas main kiya jaataa he jo kii web panne ke andar anshon ko unnat karne kaa ek tarika pradaan karte hai
 By using new information received at a later date by the user on the network, it helps to make the page more interactive, responsive and interesting

 Nearly all web browsers collect recently received data, usually on a local hard drive
 The HTTP request sent by the browser typically only asks for data that has been changed since the last download
 yadi sthaneey-kaishd data main kii bhi parivartan nahin he to usee ko dobaaraa istemaal kiya jayega
 Caching helps reduce the amount of web traffic on the Internet

 Internet banking and news sites often use this feature
 HTTP 'get' ke saath anurodhit data ke cash ho jane kii sambhaavna hoti he, yadi anya sharten puri hoti hon
 The data received in response to 'POST' is considered to be dependent on the posted data and hence it is not cached

 Confucius was a reformer, not a preacher

 He died in 480 BC i was done kanceyucious ke samaaj sudhaarak upadeshon ke kaaran chini samaaj main ek sthirataa aayi
 Confucius's philosophy remains a pioneer for Chinese education even today
 kanfushas ne kabhi bhi apane vichaaron ko likhit rup dena aavashyak nahin samajha
 He believed that he could be the bearer of ideas, not his creator
 vah puraatatv kaa upaask tha, kayonki uskaa vichaar tha ki usee ke madhyam se yatharth gyaan praapt praapt ho saktaa he
 He said that man can get rules for all his activities within himself
 na keval vyakti ke liye varan sampurna samaaj ke sudhaar or sahi vikaas ke niyam or swaroop pracheen mahatmaon ke shabdon evam kaarysheleyon main praapt ho sakate hai
 Confucius did not leave an article that represented the principles of moral and social order propounded by him
 kintu uske pautra tje sje dwaara likhit 'ausat kaa siddhant' or uske shishy tsong sin dwaara likhit 'mahan shiksha' naamak pustakon main tatsambandhi samast suchnaayen praapt hoti hai
 a treatise called 'spring and Autumn', which is also called the chronicle of Lu, is said to be written by Confucius
 yah samoochee kriti praapt he or yadhyapi bahut choti he tathaapi china ke sankshipt itihaason ke liye adarsh maani jaati he
 Overall, the number of Confucius disciples had reached 3,000, but nearly 75 of them were highly talented scholars
 uske param priy shishy uske paas hi rahaa karte the
 They used to rise and sit around him reverently and pay attention to the subtle features of his conduct and he would meditate and meditate on every word of speech coming out of his mouth
 ve usase pracheen itihaas, kavy tathaa desh kii samjik prathaon kaa adhyayan karte the
 Confucius said that good governance and peace can be established in a country only when the ruler, minister and every person of the public continue to perform the proper duties in their place
 shaasha ko sahi artho main shaasha hona chahie, mantri ko sahi artho main mantri hona chahie
 The Confucius was once asked that if he was given the responsibility of running the governorship of a state, then he would do the first important work
 iske liye uskaa uttar tha– 'naamon main sudhaar'
 This meant that the name of the post on which he is eminent should duly perform all the duties attached to the post so that his name is meaningful
 use udhaaharan or adarsh kii shakti main purna vishwaas tha
 He believed that the common people certainly bow down to the examples which the ideal person presents with his good conduct
 yadi kisi desh ke shaasha ko iskaa bhalee bhanti gyaan kara diya jaae ki use shashan kaary chalaane main kya karnaa chahie or kis prakaar karnaa chahie to nishchay hi vah apana udhaaharan prastut karke aam janata ke aacharan main sudhaar kar saktaa he or apane rajya ko sukhi, samrudh evam sampann bana saktaa he
 On the basis of this belief, the Confucius declared that if a ruler made him his chief counselor for 12 months, he could show a lot and if he was given three years, he could embody his ideals and hopes
 Can provide
 kanfushas ne kabhi is baat kaa daawa nahin kiya ki use koi daivi shakti yaa ishwariya sandesh praapt hote the
 He used to think only about what is a person and what are his duties in society
 usne shaktipradarshan, asaadhaaran evam ammanushik shaktiyon, vidroh pravriti tathaa devi devataaon kaa zikr kabhi nahin kiya
 His statement was that it is a matter of intelligence that every person should perform his duty with full accountability and honesty and keep separate from them even while honoring the Gods and Goddesses
 uskaa mat tha ki jo manushya maanav kii seva nahin kar saktaa vah devi devataaon kii seva kya karegaa
 He had full attention for all duties of himself and others, which is why he said that a bad man can never be able to rule, no matter how powerful he is
 niyamon kaa ulanghan karanevaalon ko to shaasha dand detaa hi he, parantu use kabhi yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki uske sadacharan ke adarsh prastut karne kii shakti se badhkar anya koi shakti nahin he
 The philosophy based on philosophical, social and political views of Confucianism is called Confucianism or Kungphutism
