 In 'modern Poetry and yuga-darshan', while articles centered on the poems of Nirala, Pant, Mahadevi, Nagarjuna, Bhavani Prasad Mishra present evidence of his critical ability, he is in the midst of theoretical discussions in 'literature and social context'

 UML varg ke sadasyon kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye ek tantra pradaan karata he: jaise ki visheshtaon or paddation or unke bare main atirikt jaankaree
 To ensure the visibility of a member of a class, the following are given here, which must be used before the member's name
 : There are two types of verticals for UML members: exemplar and classifier
 In the case of illustrative members, the scope is a specific instance
 visheshtaon ke maamle main iskaa arth yah he ki iskaa mahatv drushtaanton va misaalon ke aadhaar par alag-alag ho saktaa hai
 In the case of methodologies, this means that its call affects the parabolic state, in other words, parable characteristics
 anyathaa vargikaarak sadsy main kaaryakshetra varg hota he
 In terms of characteristics, this means that its significance is equal for all instances
 paddation ke maamle main, iskaa arth yah he ki iskaa aahvaan drushtaant sthiti ko prabhavit nahin karata
 vargikaarak sadsy kii pahchaan aamtaur par kai programing bhashaaon main "sthitik" ke rup main hota he
 To indicate that a member is a classifier field, his name must be underlined
 anyathaa, drushtaant ke kaaryakshetra ko difolt mana liya jayega
 a relation is a general term that combines class and substance diagrams into a specific type of logical combination
 UML in rishton ko dikhaata he: a link is a basic relationship between objects

 In combination with the upper order it can be drawn with more than two ends
 aise maamalon main tamaam sire ek kendriya heere se jude hote hai
 a combination can be named and one end of the combination can be spelled with other attributes, including its role name, title indicator, multiplicity, visibility
 sangyojan paanch vibhinn prakaar ke hote hai
 The combinations are usually bi-directional and one-directional
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek udaan varg kaa sangyojan vimaan se dwi-dishaatmak hota he
 Combinations can only be shown through square diagrams
 udhaaharan: "vibhaag dwaara prastaavit paathyakram", ek sanyojit sambandh he
 Aggregation is a synonym for connected relationship; But aggregation is far more accurate than combination
 yah ek sangyojan hi he jo purna yaa aanshik rup se kisi sambandh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Aggregation can be named as a type of combination and can be ornamented as a combination
 baharhaal, ek ekatrikaran do se adhik virgon se shaamil nahin ho sakate hai
 Aggregation occurs only when one class is a hold or holder of other classes, but where the holder is essentially not subject to the life cycle of the holder of the class, even if the holder is destroyed; But there is no heat on the material contained in it
 UML main vriksh kaa aakhri kram jo dharak varg ko samavisht varg se jodta he, ise rekhachitr dwaara khokhale hira ke aakaar main dikhaaya jaataa he Structure is a synonym of combinatorial relationship, but structure is much more accurate than aggregation
 yah ek thos heere ke aakaar main dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 While there is usually a strong life cycle dependency between the class holding the instance of the structure and the implicit class of the instance, if the character is destroyed then all the instances in it in general are also destroyed

 However, when a software or database connection, for example; If the engine ENG01 of the car model is part of the car model CM01, then the aggregation relationship is best, as the engine ENG01 can be part of any other car

 ' samanyikaran sambandh yah darshata he ki do sambandhit virgon main se ek ko anya se ko khaas mana jaataa he or is mahaprakaar ko up prakaar kaa "samanyikaran" maan liya jaataa he
 In practical terms, this means that an example of a subtype is also an example of a superclass
 is prakaar ke ekatrikaran kaa drushtaant ke yogya vriksh dwipad namatantra; masalan manushya, vanareey up prakaar hai, jo ki stanpayi kaa ek up prakaar hai
 There are other examples like this
 sambandh ko aasaani se ek vaakyansh 'A b he' ke jariye samajha jaataa he 
 In generalization, the supertype can be represented by a UML drawing at the end of the sequence in a hollow triangular shape, which connects it to one or more subtypes
 samanyikaran sambandh dharohar yaa "nihit" ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 In the generalization relationship, the general type is also known as "parent", superlative class, basic class, basic type
 samanyikaran sambandh main up prakaar "shishu ", up varg, vyutpann varg, vyutpann prakaar, uttaradhikari varg, va uttaradhikari prakaar bhi kehalaata he
 It is noteworthy that this relationship does not show any similarity in the biological parent / child relationship, although the use of these words is very common, but can still be misleading
 samanyikaran keval varg chitra par par dikhaaya ja saktaa he or peti rekhachitr main upyog kiya jaataa he

 The realization can only be shown on a square or component diagram
 pratiti virgon, antarfalkon, sanghatakon, sankulon ke bich ek rishta he, jo graahak tatv ko aapurtikarta tatv se jodta he
 The relationship between realization classes and interfaces and between components and interfaces indicates that the class performs the work proposed by the interface
 nirbharta sambandh kaa ek kamjor swaroop he jo yah darshata he ki ek varg duusare par nirbhar karata he kyonki vah usee samay uskaa prayog karata he
 Dependencies exist if the class criterion is variable or spatially variable according to the method of the other class
 sangyojan sambandh yah darshata he ki do sambandhit virgon main se ek duusare ke liye sandarbh banaata he
 In contrast to the generalization relation, it can be easily understood through a phrase that a has b sangyojan ke kram ko UML ek vaikalpik tirfalak ke jariye vastu kii bhoomika bataate hue iske sambandh ko darshata he or in sabake ant main satta ke drushtaant kii vividh sthiti ko vaikalpik sanket ke madhyam se darshata he
 Common variations are: 


 kisi project ke takneekee vishleshan ke shuruaati daur main varg chitra kaa istemaal sarini ke vaicharik pratimaan ko pesh karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 At this stage the class often takes the form of boundaries, control and power and rarely survives without any change

 They can be user interfaces, array interfaces, or device interfaces
 aamtaur par inamen se harek kartaaon ke yuj-cese ko sarini ke yuj-cese se jod kar pahachaanaa jaataa he

 Alternatively, in normal classes these may be shown above the class name in formal sign with «border»
 satta varg jin soochnaaon ko taiyaar karata he, ve sarini dwaara niyantrit hoti hai, par kabhi kabhi aacharan soochna ke saath bhi judaa hota he
 They should not be identified as basic data tables or data stores
 inhen neeche kii ore ek kshaitijak lakeer par ek vrutt rup main is tarah banaaya jaataa he ki vrutt kii puri chaudaai main failaa hota he
 Alternatively, they can be formulated as a general class with the formal sign «unit» above the class name
 yuj-cese ke liye niyantran ke pravaah ko niyantran varg sambhalata he or isliye sangyojan varg kii tarah najar aata he
 In the use case, they do not do everything, but cooperate with other classes; Who can work for them
 inhen vrutt ke rup main tir ke aakaar main vrutt ke sheersh par bain ore rakh kar dikhaaya jaataa he
 Alternatively, these can be shown above the class names in common classes with the formal sign »control«

 a child who cannot see the letters of his book can be said to be suffering from this condition
 drishtiheenta bhi isi kaa naam he
 From the inability to perceive light, the inability to do such things which cannot be done without seeing, is called blindness
 is dasha ke nimnlikhit vishesh kaaran hote hai: In northern parts of India, where there is a lot of Rohe due to excess of dust, the disease is found more
 deshavaasiyon kii aarthik dasha bhi, bahut badi seemaa tak, is rog ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Inadequate and adequate food causes diseases in the eyes, which results in blindness
 yah rog ati pracheen kaal se andhata kaa vishesh kaaran rahaa he
 This cause of blindness is found in 33 percent of blind patients coming in the eye departments of hospitals of our country
 yah rog uttar pradesh, punjab, bihar tathaa bengal main adhik hota he
 This disease is especially prevalent among children going to school in villages and earlier
 iskaa prarambh bachapan se bhi ho jaataa he
 Unhealthy dirty conditions of living of poor persons are particularly helpful in causing disease
 is rog ke updrav rup main carnia main vran ho jaataa he jo uchit chikitsa na hone par vidaar utpann kar detaa he, jisase aage chalakar andhata ho sakati he
 The cause of this disease is a virus that has been isolated from the roasts
 rohe palkon ke bhitari prishthon par ho jate hai
 Each roha is red, shining, like a raised grain, but is gray or white in color when it becomes old
 ye gol yaa chapate or chote bade kai prakaar ke hote hai
 They do not have any order
 inase panes utpann hokar carnia ke madhya kii ore failte hai
 The reason for this is the spread of disease-producing viruses
 yah dasha praayah carnia ke upree ardhbhag main adhik utpann hoti he
 Itching and burning within the eyelids, watery discharge from the eyes, lightness and pain are common symptoms
 sambhav he, aarambh main koi bhi lakshan na ho, kintu kuch samay pashchaat uparyukt lakshan utpann ho jate hai
 The eyelids become thick
 palkon ko ulatakar dekhne se un par rohe dikhaai dete hai
 There are four stages of this disease
 pehali avasthaa main shleshmik kala ek samaan shothyukt or laal makhmal ke samaan dikhaai padati he; duusari avasthaa main rohe ban jate hai
 In the third stage, the sprouts of the rohs continue to grow and in their place, there is a shrinkage in the art by making sautric metal
 chauthi or antim avasthaa main updrav utpann ho jate hai, jinka kaaran carnia main virus kaa prasar or palkon kii kala kaa sikud janaa hota he
 The penetration of infection from other diseases is very simple and often occurs always
 in rogon ke parinamswaroop shleshmakala, carnia tathaa palkon main nimnlikhit dashaayen utpann ho jaati hai: The infection of Rohe reaches a healthy child with a finger, or towel, handkerchief, etc
 from a diseased child or person and makes him sick
 aswatchta, aswasth paristhitiyaan tathaa balvardhak bhojan ke abhaav se rogotpatti main sahaayta milti he
 Dust is considered a special aid in spreading disease
 is kaaran gaanvon main yah rog adhik hota he
 Lack of appropriate treatment is responsible for the terrible consequences of the disease
 aushadhiyon or shastrkarm donon prakaar se chikitsa kii jaati he
 These are the main among the medicines: - To eat 6 to 8 tablets of sulfonamide per day
 pratijivi aushadhiyon kaa netra main prayog, netra main daalane ke liye boondon ke rup main tathaa lagane ke liye maraham ke rup main, jisaki kriya adhik samay tak hoti rahati he
 Penicillin has no benefit in this disease; Yes, other infections do destroy it
 is rog ke liye oromycin, terra mycin, chlormycitin aadi kaa bahut prayog hota he
 In our experience, using both sulfacetimide and neomycin combined results in satisfactory results
 ymide-mycitin ko, jo in donon kaa yoga he, din main chaar baar, chah se aath saptaah tak, lagaana chahie
 Also, drops of boric acid, zinc and adrenaline solution should be put in the eye
 yadi carnia kaa vran bhi ho to inke saath atropine kii boonden bhi din main do baar daalana or boric ghol se netra ko dhonaa tathaa ushm senk karnaa uchit he
 Arms treatment is to be done only when the above treatment is not beneficial
 shleshmakala ko enithene se chetanahin karke prayek rohe kii ek chimati se dabaakar phoda jaataa he
 This method has been used for a long time and it is also useful

 In the last ten years, the disease has reduced due to the use of penicillin and sulfonamide
 janm ke teen din ke bheetar netra sooj jate hai or palkon ke bich se shwet matamaile rang kaa gadha srav nikalne lagata he
 If this secretion comes out after the fourth day, then it should be understood that the infection has occurred after birth
 palkon ke bheetar kii ore se hone vaale srav kii ek buund shuddh kii hui kaanch kii shalaka se lekar kaanch kii slide par failaakar ranjit karne ke pashchaat sookshmdarshi dwaara uski pariksha karwaani chahie
 But it is not appropriate to stop the therapy until the results of the examination are known
 chikitsa turant prarambh kar deni chahie
 To prevent the disease, after birth, clean the eyes with boric lotion and apply a CC of penicillin in them
 In the solution, drops of solution of 2,500 units are added
 yah chikitsa itani safal hui he ki silver nitrate kaa do pratishat ghol daalane kii puraani pratha ab bilkul uth gai he
 The action of penicillin is also faster than sulfonamide
 chikitsa bhi penicillin se hi kii jaati he
 Drops of the above mentioned power solution of penicillin are injected into the eyes every four or five minutes until the secretion stops
 ek se teen ghante main srav band ho jaataa he
 The second method is to add drops for 15 minutes at one minute and then for two minutes, then the discharge stops in half an hour
 phir do teen dinon tak adhik antar se boonden daalate rahete hai
 If ulcers occur in the cornea, then use of atropine is also necessary
 is rog main carnia par chechak ke dane ubhar aate hai, jisase vahaan vran ban jaataa he
 Then they erupt, causing a number of disturbances
 inkaa parinaam andhata hoti he

 in updravon ke kaaran baccha andhaa ho jaat he
 Such children are often not well maintained, due to which they also fall prey to other diseases and end their lives in large numbers very soon
 netra main vitamin e yaa peroline daalkar shleshmika ko snigdh rakhana chahie
 In the cornea, it is necessary to add atropine when a ulcer occurs
 rogi ko saadhaaran chikitsa atyant aavashyak he
 Its main therapy is to give a patient a quantity of vitamin a in milk, butter, fruits, shark-liver or cod-liver oil and to inject 50,000 units of vitamin a into the body every day or every other day by injection in acute stages of the disease
 is
 rog ke aarambh main hi yadi purna chikitsa prarambh kar di jaae to rogi ke rogamukt hone kii atyadhik sambhaavna rahati he
 In our country leprosy is more prevalent in Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Madras and till now it was also a special cause of blindness
 kintu idhar sarkaar dwaara rog ke nidaan or chikitsa ke vishesh aayojanon ke kaaran is rog main ab bahut kami ho gai he or is prakaar kusht ke kaaran hue andhe vyaktiyon kii sankhya ghat gai he
 There are two types of leprosy
 ek vah jisamen tantrikas aakraant hoti hai
 The second one in which gullets or small knots are formed under the skin
 donon prakaar kaa rog andhaka utpann kar saktaa he
 In the first type of disease, due to occlusion of the seventh or ninth pulse, the muscles of the upper eyelid are destroyed and the eyelid does not stop
 isse shleshmika tathaa carnia kaa shoth utpann hota he, phir vran banate hai
 His infestation leads to blindness
 duusare prakaar ke rog main shleshmika or shwetpatal main shoth ke lakshan dikhaai dete hai
 The hair of the brow falls and the knots become like it
 carnia par shwet chooney ke samaan bindu dikhaai dene lagate hai
 Panus can also be formed
 carnia main bhi shoth ho jaataa he or yris bhi aakraant ho jaataa he 
 Due to this, he gets connected to his front and back components

 This condition can take the following forms: - siphilis kii saadhaaran chikitsa vishesh mahatv kii he
 Penicillin has been proven to be particularly useful for this
 antarpeshiy injection dwaara 10 lakh ekak prati din 10 din tak di jaati he
 Thereafter, weekly intravenous injection of Arsenic's yoga for eight weeks and between then weekly intravenous injection of bismuth-sodium-tartrate
 garam bhiige kapade se senk; Cartesone, one 100 drops or 10 mg of cartison, injected under the mucosa; atropine, 10 pratishat kii boonden netra main daalana
 It is commonly known as beriberi in public
 san 1930 main yah rog mahamari ke rup main bengal main failaa tha or balak, yuva, vruddh, stri, purush, sabko samaan rup se hua tha
 This disease was a particular nuisance
 is rog main netra ke bheetar daav, bad jaati he or drushti kshetra ksheen hota jaataa he, yahan tak ki kuch samay main vah purnataya samaapt ho jaataa he or vyakti drishtiheen ho jaataa he
 In the end, vision and pulse also decay
 baahar se dekhne main netra saamaanya prakaar ke dikhaai padate hai, kintu vyakti ko kuch bhi dikhaai nahin padataa
 In the event of disease, a small hole is made at the confluence of the cornea and sclera, in addition to the usual treatment of epidemiology, before the umbilical cord
 ise triphining kehete hai
 This keeps the fluid coming out of the anterior chamber of the eyeball and is absorbed by the whitetail
 is prakaar netra kii daab badhane nahin paati
 This is also a major cause of blindness

 Mostly, the patient consults the doctor only when acute pain and other symptoms are intensified
 yadi doctor netra rogon kaa visheshgy hota he to vah rog ko pahachaanakar uski upyukt chikitsa kaa aayojan karata he, jisase rogi andhaa nahin hone paata
 But due to the acute exacerbation of symptoms, the patient often does not show the doctor until the vision is produced, but there is no hope of beneficial therapy
 is prakaar ke rog ke akraman rah rahakar hote hai
 There are no symptoms of the disease in the intervening period
 keval purvakoshth kaa uthalaapan rah jaataa he jiskaa pataa rogi ko nahin chalata
 This often leads to confusion in the diagnosis of the disease
 bhram utpann karne vaala doosraa rog motiyobind he jo saadharantah adhik aayu main hota he
 Chronic primary ovulatory also occurs at this stage

 In the legal field, the term is used only in the sense of contract
 kuch vidwaanon ke mat se iske antargat keval ve hi samjhaute liye ja sakate hai jo kanuunan lagu kiye ja sakate hon
 This is an improvement in definition, despite not being universally accepted
 vibhinn deshon ke apane-apane kanoon hote hai, jo vahaan ke nivaasiyon ke parsparik daayitv nishchit karte hai
 "indian Contract Act 1872" has also become in India
 iske pehle vyaktiyon ke parsparik bartaav tathaa daayitv unke reeti-rivaaj, roodhiyon yaa dharmik manyataon ke aadhaar par niyantrit hote the
 Voluntary agreement between two or more persons, or parties, according to which an act is obligated to give, do, bear, or behave in a particular manner in exchange for an act, behavior, or action prohibited by a party
 Which is done for the purpose of establishing an interdisciplinary legal relationship between those parties, takes the form of "fine"
 is prakaar koi saamaajik nimantran sweekaar kar lene par saamanytah koi kanoonee jimmedaari nahin aati, at: vah thika nahin mana jaataa
 Any agreement that is legally enforceable by law is void
 kanuunan vahi samjhauta lagu kiya ja saktaa he, jo thike kii arhata rakhane vaale pakshon ke madhya, unki swatantra sahmati ke falswaroop, vidhisammat uddeshy se, vidhisammat vyavhaar ke liye kiya gaya ho or spasht rup se radd na ghoshit kiya gaya ho
 Along with this, the ban of any other special law will also be applicable, according to which it should be written, stamped, inked with witnesses and registered under the then law of registration
 thike main kam-se-kam do paksh hote hai, ek samjhaute kaa prastaav karne vaala or doosraa use sweekrut karanevaala
 The "offer" and "acceptance" together constitute the "agreement", which when legally enforceable is "settled"

 Free consent means that it is not caused by coercion, undue influence, deception, unwarranted submission or mistake
 in sabaki paribhaashaayen kanoon main di gai hai
 The objective of the law is to implement the true intentions of the parties, as far as possible
 at: kisi bhi paksh ke avyask yaa veikshipt hone se thika radd mana jaataa he
 Sometimes a derailment by a demented person is not considered canceled
 dhokhe yaa anrut prastutikaran dwaara yadi kisi paksh kii sahmati praapt kii gai ho, to vah paksh, yadi thik samajhe, thike ko puraa karvaa saktaa he or un sab maangon ko pesh kar saktaa he jinka vah adhikari hota, yadi prastutikaran thik hota; kintu apni saamaanya buddhi se vaastaviktaa ko jaan sakane kii sthiti main hote hue sahmati dene vaala paksh thike ko radd nahin karvaa saktaa
 In the same way, only extraordinary mistakes, which actively strike at the core of not just some of the conditions, but can be a cause for cancellation
 thike main antarnihit uddeshy yaa vyavhaar kaa vidhisammat hona anivaary he, arthath vah kanoon se nishiddh na ho, kisi kanoon ke abhipraay par ghaatak prabhaav na daale, dhokhebaaji se bharaa na ho, duusare ko pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se shaareerik yaa saanpattik kshati na pahunchaae, athwa adaalat dwaara naitikta yaa niti kaa virdohi na mana jaataa ho, anyathaa thika avaidhanik or radd samajha jaataa he
 Even if the motive or behavior is partially illegal, all this is considered canceled
 thika purna karne ke do dhang hai : bhaag lene vaale pakshon dwaara thika samaapt karne kaa aapasi samjhauta kar liya jaae, yaa niyamon or pratibandhon ke anusaar uske uddeshy or vyavhaar puure kar liye jaaen
 Even after the death of the person who takes the responsibility, their representatives have an obligation to fulfill it, if there is no other intention to do so
 jaise kisi nishchit tithi tak kisi saamagree ke sambharan ke thike main donon pakshon main se kisi kii mrityu ke pashchaat, uskaa pratinidhi thika puraa karne ke liye baadhya hoga; kintu koi chitra bana dene ke thike main ek kii mrityu ke uparaant uskaa pratinidhi na swayan baadhya he, na duusare ko baadhya kar saktaa he
 According to the rules and restrictions, the failure is not completed
 aisi sthiti main kshatigrast paksh samay bhang karne vaale paksh se uchit harjaana praapt karne kaa adhikari hota he; kintu yadi kshatipurti kii raashi yaa harjaana swaroop anya kisi shart kaa spasht ullekh nahin he, to kisi apratyaksh athwa doorvyapee kshati ke liye harjaana dey nahin he
 Sometimes, with the acceptance of the proposal, some heritage is given, which is indicative of the ploy of the parties presented to the settlement
 yah raashi thike ke falswaroop hone vaale bhugtan kaa ansh nahin, kintu thike ke kriyanvit na hone par harjane kaa ansh avashya ban jaati he
