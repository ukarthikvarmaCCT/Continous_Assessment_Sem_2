 vigyaan evam praudyogiki main kisi falan ko chote-chote saral falnon ke yoga ke rup main vyakt karne ko vishleshan kaha jaataa he evam isaki ulti prakriya ko sanshleshan kehete hai
 We know that it is possible to express any recurring function as the sum of the appropriate amplitude, frequency and sine waves of art using the Fourier series
 iske samanyikaran ke rup main yah bhi kah sakate hai king kisi bhi samay ke saath parivartansheel sanket ko uchit aayam, aavriti evam kala kii sin tarango ke yoga ke rup main vyakt karnaa sambhav he
 Furrier analysis is a technique that can be used to tell which sine waves a signal consists of
 falnon ko saral tukdon main todkar samajhane kaa prayaas furiar vishleshan kaa saar he
 Nowadays furrier analysis has expanded to become known as part of a more general harmonic analysis
 furiar vishleshan se anya baton ke alaava yah pataa chalata he ki koi sanket kin-kin aavruti ke sin tarangon se milakar bana he arthath kin aavriti ke sin tarangon kaa aayam adhik he kinakaa kam he or kinakaa bilkul hi nahin yaa naganya he
 a signal is mainly made up of frequencies - this knowledge is very useful
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi ghurnan karne vaali mashin main koi avaanchit kampan ho rahaa he to furiar vishleshan kaa upyog karke us kampan kii aavriti pataa kii ja sakati he; phir dekhte hai ki is aavriti par koun si ghatana ghat rahi he or is prakaar us avaanchit kampan ke strot kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he

 In addition, with the help of furrier transforms, it helps to express a signal in short form
 udaahranarth jepeg compresssont karne ke liye kisi chhavi ke chote-chote vargakar bhaagon ke furiar transafarm kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or isamen se kam aayam vaale ksheen avyavon ko puri tarah nikaal diya jaataa he
 To reverse the image, its reverse process is adopted
 furiar vishleshan kii koun si sankriya kab prayog kii jaayegi, yah us falan kii prakruti par nirbhar karata he
 For example, if the function is the sequence of n discrete data =) then using DFT would be beneficial there

 is adhinium ko multah agast 1935 main paarit kiya gaya tha or ise us samay ke adhiniyamit sansad kaa sabase lanbaa adhinium kaha jaataa tha
 Because of its length, the Government of India Act 1935 was divided into two separate Acts in response: bhartiya raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik itihaas par sahitya main sandarbh ko aamtaur par bharat sarkaar 1935 adhinium ko sankshipt rup mana jaataa he, bajaay adhinium ke paath ke rup main mul rup se adhiniyamit karne ke liye The most important aspects of the Act were: haalanki, swaittata kii degree prantiy str kii shuruuaat mahatvapurn simaaon ke adheen tha: prantiy governor mahatvapurn arakshit shaktiyon ko barkaraar rakhaa or british adhikariyon ne bhi ek jimmedaar sarkaar ko nilambit adhikaar banaae rakhaa
 The demand for parts of the Act was to establish the Union of India but never came into operation due to opposition from the rulers of the princely states
 jab adhinium ke tahat pehla chunaav kaa aayojan hua tab adhinium kaa shesh bhaag 1937 main lagu hua
 Since the second half of the nineteenth century, the Indian people have consistently demanded a greater role in the government of their country
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan british yuddh prayaason ke liye bharatiyon kaa yogadan karne kaa matlab tha ki british raajnneetik pratishthan ke adhik roodhiwaadee tatwon main sanvaidhanik parivartan kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos karnaa or jiske parinamswaroop bharat sarkaar kaa 1919 adhinium
 is adhinium ne sarkaar ke ek nav pranali kii shuruuaat kii jise prantiy "dvishasan", ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, yani, kuch kshetron kii sarkaar ko prantiy vidhayika ke liye jimmedaar mantriyon ke haathon main rakhaa gaya jabaki anya ko british-niyukt prantiy governor ke liye jimmedaar adhikariyon ke haath main banaae rakhaa gaya
 While the Act was a reflection of the demand of Indians to play a larger role in government, it was also a reflection of British fears about what that role might mean in India's system
 dvishasan ke saath prayog asantoshjanak sabit hua
 a particular disappointment for Indian leaders was that in areas where they gained only nominal control, the "main authority" was in the hands of the British bureaucracy
 bharat kii sanvaidhanik vyavasthaaon kii samiksha kaa iraadaa kiya gaya tha or un rajasi rajyon jo ise sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar the
 However, a split between the Congress and the Muslim representatives proved to be the main factor to prevent the settlement as the system had significant knowledge of the Sangh's functioning
 vyavastha ke khilaaf, landan main nai kanjarvative prabhutv rashtriya sarkaar apane swayan ke prastaav ke masauda taiyaar karne ke saath aage aane kaa nirnay liya
 a joint parliamentary selection committee headed by Lord Linlithgow reviewed the White Paper to a great extent
 is white paper ke aadhaar par, bharat sarkaar ke bill kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 Committee level and later bigotry was pacified, "security" strengthened and indirect elections for the Central Legislative Assembly were re-organized
 bill ko vidhivat agast 1935 main kanoon main paarit kiya gaya
 One consequence of this process is that, although the Government of India Act of 1935 should have gone a little further to meet Indian demands, both the expansion of the bill and the lack of Indian participation in its draft material meant that India The act proved to be radical for a significant element in Britain, while having the act with the best blunt response
 yadhyapi prastaavna ko shaamil karne ke liye british sansad ke adhiniyamon ke liye yah asaamaanya ho gai, bharat sarkaar ke adhinium 1935 se ek kii kami 1919 ke adhinium ke saath virodhabhas ho gai, jiske chalate bhartiya raajnneetik vikaas ke liye usase sambandhit us adhinium kaa uddeshy ke vyapak darshan ko sthapit kiya
 On 20 August 1917, the Preamble of the 1919 Act is quoted based on the statement of Edwin Montagu, Minister of India for the House of Commons, which promises: 


british samrajya ke ek abhinn hissaa ke rup main bharat main jimmedaar sarkaar kii pragatisheel prastuti ke liye ek darshan ke saath swayan-shaasi sanstha kaa dhire-dhaare vikaas he
 Indian demands with existing Dominions such as Canada and Australia now had to achieve constitutional parity in British India, which meant complete autonomy in the British Commonwealth
 british raajnneetik cirkil main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke kaaran shaq kiya ki bhartiya is aadhaar par unke desh ko chalaane main sakasham the or paryaapt "suraksha" ke saath, shaayad, kramik sanvaidhanik vikaas kii ek lambii avadhi ke baad ek uddeshy ke rup main dominian sthiti ko dekha
 This tension between them and the vision within the Indian and the British resulted in the clumsy agreement of the 1935 Act which had no preamble of its own, but the preamble of the 1919 Act replaced it, yet repealed the remnants of that act
 saamaanya rup se ise british se adhik mishrit sandeshon ke rup main bharat main dekha gaya, jo ki apane taraf se nirutsahi ravaiya ko sujhaati thi or bhartiya ichchhaaon ko santusht karne kii disha main "nunatam aavashyak" ke nikrushtatam drushtikon kaa suzav detii thi
 Unlike most modern constitutions, but common with Commonwealth constitutional law of the time, the Act did not incorporate the "bill of rights" within the new system that was intended to be established
 haalanki, bharat sangh ke prastaavit maamle main vahaan adhikaron ke ek set ko shaamil karne main kuch jatiltaayen thim, jaisaa ki nai ikai main nammaatr prabhutv rajasi rajyon shaamil the
 However a different view was considered by some and the draft outline constitution in the Nehru Report incorporated the bill's authority
 1947 main, adhinium main ek apekshaakrit kuch sanshodhano se bharat or pakistan ke antarim karyanvan samvidhan banaaya gaya
 The Act was not only extremely elaborate, but it was surrounded with a 'security standard', designed to enable the British Government to intervene whenever it was needed to maintain British responsibilities and interests
 is lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke sansthaanon kii dhire-dhire bad rahi he bhartiyakaran ke chehre main, adhinium upyog ke liye nirnay or british niyukt vysarai ke haathon main suraksha upayon kii vaastavik prashasan or prantiy governron jo bharat ke liye rajya sachiv ke niyantran ke adheen tha
 'the vast powers and responsibilities that the Governor General must discipline according to his discretion or his personal decision, it is clear that he is expected to be like Superman
 uske paas vinamrata, saahas or kadi mehnat ke liye ek anant kshamta ke saath sampann hona chahie "hamane is bill main kai suraksha upayon ko daalaa he" sar robert horn ne kaha 


 "lekin ve saare suraksha upaay ek hi vyakti ke bare main vichaar karti he or vah he visarai he
 He is the lynch-pin of the entire system
 


 agar vysarai vifal hota he, kuch bhi aapke sthapit pranali ko bachaa nahin saktaa
 "this speech reflects the vision of the staunch Torridge who was frightened one day by the possibility of the Viceroy being appointed by the Labor Government
 adhinium ko thik se padhane se se pataa chalata he ki british sarkaar ne ise apane liye taiyaar kiya he, jab bhi unhen mahasoos hoga tab ve kisi bhi samay kanoonee upkaran ke saath is par puraa niyantran le sakate the
 However, doing so without any precise reason would have eroded their credibility with groups of India whose aim was to achieve the Act
 kuch visham vichaar: "in the federal government 


 has presented a glimpse of responsible government
 lekin vaastaviktaa kaa abhaav he, maamle ke anusaar raksha or videshi maamalon main jaruri shaktiyon kii kami he, rajyapal general ko aavashyak taur mantri gatividhi ke liye seemaa pradaan kii gai he or bhartiya rajyon ke pratinidhitiv ke upaay ko nakaaratmak pradaan kiya gaya he or yahaan tak ki loktantric niyantran kii shuruyaat kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 It would be of great interest to see the development of the creation of a highly specialized government; Certainly, if it operates successfully, the most credit will go to the political ability of Indian leaders who have faced more serious difficulties than colonial politicians who developed a system of self-government that is now Dominion level
 i am on a climax

 It requires a fairly elaborate provision for the Viceroy to intervene if, in his appeal-disqualified view, any Indian law or act demands, or indeed, discrimination against, British subjects resident in Britain, British registered companies and, in particular, British Shipping interests

 In this form of compromise, the Foreign Secretary always consulted the Board of Trade and it was assumed that the Governor General would consult the Commerce Minister in India in a manner

 This was not an ideal, but it is the only one at this stage
 


 kuch dinon ke baad sapru, vysarai se milane birla aayaa tha
 He thought that the Congress was moving towards the Sangh's acceptance
 birla ne kaha ki kendra ke liye raksha or videshi maamle ke aarakshan ke dwaara gandhi isse zyada chintit nahin the lekin rajyon ke pratinidhiyon ko chunane ke tareeke par dhyaan de rahe the
 Birla wanted the Viceroy to help Gandhi in choosing certain kings towards the democratic election of the delegates
 


 Then Birla said that this is the only chance of agreement between the government and Congress and discussion between Gandhi and Viceroy is the best hope
 " The British government sent Lord Linlithgow as the new Viceroy to bring the Act into effect

 Although it is difficult to find a concomitant urge of European superiority in Marx's writings, critics say that his understanding of world-history was based on European experience and that he could see the future of humanity as a reflection of the European model as a whole Used to see 1851 se hi duniya ke nakshon ke longitude meredian ke centre main greenvich, landan ko rakhaa janaa eurokendriyata kaa hi ek tathy he jise bina kisi saanskrithik aapatti ke sari duniya ne hazam kar liya he
 a notable example of Eurocentricity under post-colonial studies is the Mercator Atlas
 is atlas main europe kaa samshitoshna kshetra duusare kshetron ke mukaable kahin bade aakaar kaa dikhaaya gaya he
 In this atlas, the map of the world is not depicted only with objective lines showing different continents
 maanchitr main spes vichaardhaaratmak rup se moort kiya gaya he or isamen nakshe ke saath diye gayi paath or anya chitron kii madad bhi lee gayi he
 As a result, this map places Europe at the center of the world's spatial and cultural meanings
 edward said kii kriti 'orientlizam' main eurokendriyata kii kadi jaanch-padtaal kii gayi he
 Saeed says that this idea not only pushes other cultures to make them like themselves, but imposes the West's dominance over them by placing them at a particular point in the realm of their experience
 said ke mutabik gyanoday ke baad se hi europee samskruti ne ek pranalibaddh anushaasan viksit kar liya he jiske auzaaron se vah purv kii duniya ko prabandhit karte hue gadhati he
 Eurocentricity is also confirmed through the discipline of literature-study, historiography and anthropology
 sahitya ke kshetra main iske pairokaron ne badi chaalaaki se apni dharanaon ko sahitya ke saarvbhaum kii tarah sthapit karne kii pariyojna chalaai
 Writing was done from the point of view of the winners in history
 maanavshaastra kii duniya main eurokendriyata ne swajativaadee aagrah ke rup main ghuspaith kii or gair-europee samskritiyon ko europee sabhyatamoolak maanakon ke barakes ‘aadim’ qaraar diya
 Some culture-critics believe that if Eurocentric thought was not already established, the earliest forms of anthropology would not have established such a close relationship with colonialism
 isiyat ke prachaar-prasar ke liye mishnariyon dwaara chalaayi jane vaali shaikshanik gatividhiyon main bhi eurokendriyata kii pushti karne kaa rujhaan rahata he
 It is for these reasons that non-european societies have so embodied Eurocentricity in the process of modernization that the idea of considering everything or work coming from the West as the best, on all the important fields like science, industry, mathematics, arts, entertainment and culture Has almost permanently dominated
 yahan tak ki eurokendriyata ke prati satark rahane vaale log bhi antat uske saath talmail baithaate hue paye jate hai
 Historically, the idea of european superiority was strengthened in the fifteenth century along with European imperialism
 vaigyanik kranti, vanijyik kranti or aupniveshik samrajyon ke vistaar ne aadhunik yug ke udai ke rup main swayan ko abhivyakti kiya
 It is considered as a period of 'european miracle' before which Europe could not be economically and technologically pitted against Ottoman Turkish, Mughal Empire of India and Ming Empire of China
 attharahavin or unnisvin sadi kii audyogic kranti or europee upniveshikaran kii duusari lahar ke saath hi yah avadharana apane charam par pahunch gayi
 European forces dominated trade and politics in the world
 pragativaad or udyogwaad ke aadhaar par tezi se viksit hui europee sabhyataa ko vishwa kaa saarvbhaum centre maanane waalon ne akhet, kheti or pashupaalan par aadhaarit samaajon ke prati tiraskaarpurn vimarsh rache
 It was only in the eighteenth century that European writers could be found comparing Europe and other continents of the world, saying that Europe is smaller in geographical area than others, but for different reasons it has a special position
 iske baad yah khaas sthiti europee reeti-rivaazon, shishtataa, vigyaan or kala main uski maharath kaa tark de kar paribhaashit kii jaati thi
 a question is also raised about Eurocentricity, whether this trend is not a variety of autism found in other parts of the world? Cultural superiority also arises among Chinese and Japanese
 'american sadi' kii daavedaariyaan bhi swajatvaad kaa hi ek namoona he
 But as soon as Eurocentricity is viewed with the perspective of colonialism, the idea starts to look like a distinct structure, different from normal autonomy
 eurokendriyata kii saakh main kshay kii shuruyaat bhi upniveshwaad virdohi andolanon ke jor pakadaney or dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad chali vi-upniveshikaran kii yugpravartak prakriya se hui
 Nationalist claims of local traditions and values made by the freedom movements challenged Western cultural ego
 bharat or america mahadweep ke madhya va dakshini hisson main isi makasad se naye itihaas kaa srijan hua or nayi saanskrithik asmitaayen gadhi gayin
 Against Eurocentricity, colors were painted in multicenter pictures of world civilization
 rabindra nath thakur jaisi purvi hastiyon ke vichaaron kii vishwavyaapee pratishtha or gandhi pradutt pashchim kii sabhyatamoolak aalochana ne bhi eurokendriyata ko manch se dhakelne main ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaai

 shakt sampradaay' hindu dharm ke teen pramukh sampradaayon main se ek he
 Almighty is considered a goddess in this community
 kai deviyon kii manyata he jo sabhi ek hi devi ke vibhinn rup hai
 Many traditions are also found under Shakta faith, ranging from Lakshmi to the dreadful Kali
 kuch shakt sampradaay apni devi kaa sambandh shiv yaa vishnu se bataate hai
 The Shruti and Smriti Granth of Hindus are seen to form the main historical basis of the Shakta tradition
 iske alaava shakt log devimahatmaya, devibhagwat puraana tathaa shakt upanishdon par aasthaa rakhte hai
 Shakta means 'worship of Bhagwati Shakti'
 shakt dharm shakti kii sadhana kaa vigyaan he
 Its observant Shakta religion is also considered as old as the ancient Vedic religion
 yah baat ullekhneey he ki is dharm kaa vikaas vaidic dharm ke saath hi saath yaa sanathan dharm main ise samaveshit karne kii zarurat ke saath hi hua
 It is a major form of worship in Hinduism, now called 'hinduism', it can be divided into three interlinked, interconnected streams
 vaishnavvaad, bhagwaan vishnu kii upasna; shaivavaad, bhagwaan shiv kii puja; tathaa shaktavaad, devi ke shakti rup kii upasna
 Thus Shaktism is a common term in South Asia designating various goddess traditions, the common focus of which is the worship of goddesses
 'shakti kii puja'shakti ke anuyaayiyon ko aksar 'shakt' kaha jaataa he
 The devotees not only worship Shakti, but also try to enrich, control and transform its power-manifestation into the power or energy of the human body and the living universe

 That is why it is also called Purana of Shakta sect
 shastron main kaha gaya he- 'maatar: sarvabhootanaan gaav:' yani gaay samast praaniyon kii mata he
 That is why even in Aryan culture, Shaivite, Shakta, Vaishnavite, Gaanapatya, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh, etc
, they all have respect for cow even if there is a difference in the practices of worship and ritual in all the sects

 Among them, 51-52 Shakti Peethas have a very important place
 isi main durga saptshati bhi he
 Shaktis believe that the supreme power of the world is feminine
 isiilie ve devi durga ko hi ishwar rup main puujate hai
 In all the religions of the world, the imagery of God has been done like a man
 arthath ishwar purush jaisaa ho saktaa he, kintu shakt dharm duniya kaa ekmaatr aisa dharm he, jo sristi rachanaakaar ko janani yaa stren maanata he
 In fact, this is the only religion of women
 shiv to shav he, shakti param prakaash he
 However, the number of Shakta philosophy is the same
 'pracheenta'sindhu ghati sabhyataa main bhi matrudevi kii puja ke pramaan milte hai
 Shakta sect is an ancient sect

 hindu aasthaa kaa pratibimb' Shaktism as a theoretical or popular religious category is a reflection of the Hindu belief that innumerable goddesses of rural and Sanskrit legends are manifestations of a Mahadevi

 But historically, its calculation is probably of medieval period
 jab atyadhik visham sthaneey evam akhil bhartiya paramparaon kaa ekikaran saidhantik rup se ekikrut dharamshastra main kiya jaataa tha
 Theology can be used in historically and theoretically different traditions

 The concept and technology of text messaging is being used as a task even if a different protocol is used

 adhikansh tihara sa sandesh ek mobile se duusare mobile par paath sandesh hote hai jisamen sandesh prasaaran kii maanak sahyog vaali anya kismon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The idea of adding text messaging to mobile users' services was prevalent in many communities of mobile communication services in the early 1980s
 in samudaayon main bahut se samudaayon ke visheshgyon ne un charchaaon main apana yogadan diya jisapar jiesem sevaayen honi chahien
 Most of the ideas of Triple s as a means of alerting a single mobile user, for example, were based on previously secure voice mail, while in others, more complex applications such as telemetry were taken into account
 lekin kuch kaa maananaa he ki tihara sa kaa prayog em mobile upyogkarta se duusare mobile upyogkarta ke paas sandesh bhejne ke liye kiya jaae
 The GSM subgroup WP3, under the chairmanship of J, began to be used after already being discussed
 odusted kaa kahana he ki nai digital cellular pranali ke liye ek sambhavit seva ke rup main pramukh jiesem samooh main tihara sa par vichaar kiya jaataa tha
 In the GSM document, short messages appear on the table of GSM Teleservices under the services and facilities provided under the GSM system, which are both mobile-borne and suspended

 Here is a rudimentary description of the three services
 haalanki prarambh main isaki vruddhi dhimi thi jisamen keval 1995 graahak jiesem ke prati graahak ke taur par ausat rup se ek maheene main 0;4 sandesh hi bhej pate the
 One of the reasons for the triple recovery was the slow installation of the charging system by the operators, especially for prepaid customers and eliminating fraudulent bills that used the SMSC on private handsets to use other operators' SMSC
 This was possible only by changing the setting
 samay bitne ke saath-saath esemessi par bill banaae jane ko switch billing se badal diya gaya jisamen esemessi ke andar hi kuch nai visheshtaayen thim jo videshi mobile yuzaron ko iske dwaara sandesh bhejne kii anumati ko roak detii thim
 By the end of 2000, the average number of messages per user per month had risen to 35, and by Christmas Day 2006, 205 million articles had been sent to the UK alone as well

 It is also called local adjournment model
 agrigaters ke paas eses7 protocol kii sidhi pahunch kii kami hoti he jo aisa protocol he jahaan tihara sa sandeshon kaa vinimay kiya jaataa he
 These suppliers have neither control over the message delivery nor visibility thereby rendering the delivery ineligible
 esemes sandesh oprator ke esemes-si main deliver kiye jate hai na ki graahak ke handsat par
 Another variety of SMS gate suppliers is based on SS7 connectivity, also known as the international adjacency model, to route triple messages
 is model kaa laabh eses7 ke madhyam se data ko sidhe bhejne kii yogyata he jo sevadata ko tihara sa bhejte samay sampurna maarg par purna niyantran or drishyata pradaan karti he
 This means that triple messages can be sent directly among the people, for which there is no need to resort to third party centers of other mobile operators

 Mobile-borne short messages can be used for services such as televoting in a premium rated method
 is maamle main seva pradaan karne vaala vieespi telephone network oprator se short code praapt karata he ore graahak us nambar par lekh bhejte hai
 Payments to carriers vary and the percentage premium paid is the highest on SMS services
 adhikansh soochna pradaataaon ko karier tak premium esemes kii laagat ke lagbhag 45 pratishat bhaag bhugtan karne kii apeksha kerani chahie
 The submission of the article to the SMSC is analogous to the standard MO short message submission but once the article arrives at the SMSC, the service center identifies the short code as a premium service
 ise baad essi lekh sandesh kii saamagree ko vieespi ke paas bhej detaa he jisamen esampipi athwa iedi jaise ypi protocol kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Money is charged from customers for sending these types of messages in which the revenue is distributed between the network operator and the VASP

 Standard Hindi is the standard form of Hindi which is used in education, office functions etc
 bhashaa kaa kshetra desh, kaal or paatr kii drushti se vyapak he
 That's why all languages have different forms
 in vividh roopon main ekta kii koshish kii jaati he or use maanak bhashaa kaha jaataa he
 In Hindi, the meaning of 'standard language' was previously 'sadhu Bhasha', 'taksali Bhasha', 'shuddha Bhasha', 'adarsh bhasha' and 'deferred Language' etc
 angrezi shabd ‘standard’ ke pratishbd ke rup main ‘maan’ shabd ke sthirikaran ke baad ‘standard languij’ ke anuwaad ke rup main ‘maanak bhashaa’ shabd chal padaa
 The etymology of the word 'standard' in English is controversial
 kuch log ise ‘stand’ se jodate hai to kuch log ekstand ‘badhanaa’ se
 In my view it is related to 'stand'
 vah jo kadaa hokar, spashtatah auron se alag pratimaan kaa kaam kare
 'standard language' also acts as a paradigm different from non-standard language forms
 usee ke aadhaar par kisi ke dwaara prayukt bhashaa kii maanakta amaanakta kaa nirnay kiya jaataa he
 People have tried to clarify 'standard language' in various ways
 robins ke anusaar saamaajik drushti se mahatvapurn logon kii boli ko maanak bhashaa kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Stewart has considered four grounds for showing differences in different types of language based on nature, internal system and social usage etc
 ‘aitihaasikta’ kaa arth he, bhashaa kii pracheen parampara or kaal kii drushti se uskaa vikaas
 Most languages continue from generation to generation, then from second to third and so on from generation to generation
 yahi unki aitihaasikta he
 It is mentioned that artificial languages like Espiranto, Ido, Longlan lack this historicity
 arthath bhashaa ko ek maanak rup dena
 a form in which one of the options obtained has been accepted as the standard and the language form which all the speakers of that language accept
 yah baat dhyaan dene kii he ki saare vishwa kii adhikansh samunnat bhashaaon kaa maanak rup hota he, jabaki avbhasha, boli creole aadi kaa maanak rup nahin hota
 Due to standardization, a language is identical in terms of vocabulary and grammar in its entire field, so it is also comprehensible to all people
 saath hi vah sabhi logon dwaara maanya hoti he atah anya bhashaa roopon kii tulana main vah adhik pratishthit bhi hoti he
 That is, the user of language is a society in which that language is used in speaking and writing etc
 jeevant bhashaa main nirantar vikaas hota rahata he
 All the languages and dialects spoken in the world find vibrancy
 haan, sanskrit, latin, pali, praakrit, apbhransh jaisi puraani yaa clasik bhashaayen aaj saamaanya prayog main nahin hai, isiilie unamem jeevantta nahin maani ja sakati
 Autonomy means that a language is not dependent on another language for its existence
 saamanytah bhashaayen swytt hoti hai, kintu boliyaan swytt nahin hotin; ve apane astitv ke liye bhashaa par nirbhar karti hai
 That is why we have to say for every dialect that that dialect is of such language but there is no such obligation in respect of language
 in aadhaaron ko lekar ham vichaar karen to clasik bhashaa main aitihaasikta hoti he, maanakta hoti he, kintu jeevantta nahin hoti, boli main maanakta tathaa swaittata nahin hoti, avbhasha main maanakta nahin hoti kratim bhashaa main keval maanakta hoti he, pigin main maatr aitihaasikta hoti he, creole main anya sabhi hoti he, kintu maanakta nahin hoti
 In standard language, these are only four characteristics
 vastutah stiwart kii ye baaten yah to batalaati hai ki maanak bhashaa main uparyukt chaar visheshtaayen hoti hai, ‘kintu maanak bhashaa main maanakta bhi hoti he’ kaa tab tak koi arth nahin, jab tak ki ham yah na bataaen ki maanakta kya he
 The following things come in normality- ‘maanak bhashaa’ kisi bhashaa ke us rup ko kehete hai jo us bhashaa ke puure kshetra main shuddh mana jaataa he tathaa jise us pradesh kaa shikshit or shisht samaaj apni bhashaa kaa adarsh rup maanata he or praayah sabhi aupchaarik paristhitiyon main, lekhan main, prashasan or shiksha, ke madhyam ke rup main yathasadhay usee kaa prayog karne kaa praytn karata he
 Among the many reasons which awakened the spirit of standardization of languages in the world, social urgency, promotion of press, trend towards uniformity with the development of scientific outlook and self-identity etc
 are the main ones
 yahan inamen ek-do ko thode vistaar se dekh lenaa anyathaa na hoga
 For example, the social necessity of standard language cannot be denied
 kisi bhi kshetra ko len, sabhi boliyon main prashasan sahitya-rachana, shiksha dena yaa aapas main baatcheet kathin bhi he, avyaavhaarik bhi
 Talking about Hindi, it is not possible to do so in his twenty-five dialects
 aaj to kumaunni bhashi naamak hindi ke jariye maithili bhashi se baatcheet karata he kintu yadi maanak hindi na hoti to donon ek duusare kii baat samaj na pate
 Translation of literature of other dialects in all dialects is also not very feasible due to lack of means, in such a situation Shailesh Matiani's literature could not be enjoyed by Maithili speaking, nor Nagarjuna's literature could be enjoyed by Kumayuni, Garhwali or Hariyani
 is tarah sabhi boliyon ke upar ek maanak bhashaa ko isliye aropit karnaa, acha yaa bura jo bhi ho, uski saamaajik anivaaryta he or isliye vibhinn kshetron main kuch maanak bhashaayen swayan viksit hui hai, kuch kii gai hai or unhone un kshetron ko kaaphi dur-dur tak samajhe janevaale madhyam ke rup main anant suvidhaayen pradaan kii hai
 The invention and publicity of such presses have also made normality mandatory

 Chief among these is: - motopa shaareerik or maansik str par jivan main kai saare parivartan laata he
 Due to which the symptoms are reflected in the person

 The main symptoms of obesity are as follows
 : • Breathlessness - Repeated breathing problem is a symptom of obesity which can be caused due to many reasons and causes many diseases

 • akelaa mahasoos karnaa – motaape main akelaapan anubhav karnaa ek aam baat he
 Due to physical changes, people feel different and alone

 Measures to avoid obesity include ek yuva vyakti ke sharir kaa apekshit vajan uski lambaai ke anusaar hona chahie, jisase ki uskaa shaareerik gathan anukool lage
 The simplest measure to measure body weight is body mass index and it is calculated by doubling the length of a person's body by dividing the weight by kilogram

 girte hue yaa behate hue jal kii urja se jo vidyut utpann kii jaati he use jalavidyut kehete hai
 In 2005, around 816 gwe of hydroelectric power was generated worldwide, which is about 20% of the total electric power of the world
 yah bijli pradooshan rahit he
 And it is environmentally friendly
 bharat main vidyaman aarthik rup se dohan yogya tathaa arthksham jal sambhavyata 66 pratishat bhaar kaarak par 84,000 megawatt aanklit kii gai he 
 In addition, 6780 MW of installed capacity has been estimated from small, small and micro hydropower schemes
 94,000 megawatt kii sanchit sthapit kshamta ke saath pump kii gai bhandaran yojanaon hetu 56 sthalon kii bhi pahchaan kii gai he
 However, so far only 19
9% of this potential has been exploited
 vidyut, jal se utpann jal se praapt kii gai vidyutshakti ko jalavidyut kehete hai
 Hydropower is very important in the methods of generating electric power
 vishwa kii sampurna vidyut shakti kaa ek tihaai bhaag jalavidyut ke rup main praapt hota he
 Thus, the available energy in any form can be used for generation of electric power
 jalprapaat main girte hue pani main nihit urja kaa upyog pracheen kaal se hi panchakki ko chalaane main kiya jaataa rahaa he, parantu is urja kaa vidyutshakti ke liye upyog beesvin shatabdi kii hi dein he
 Not only can the energy contained in falling water be used for power generation, but the kinetic energy contained in flowing water can also be used for power generation
 iske liye sabase pehle aise sthaan kaa chunaav karnaa hota he, jahaan band baandhakar prachur maatra main pani jamaa kiya ja sake or usamen nihit shakti ko vidyut shakti ke janan ke liye jal ko aavashyaktaanusaar nalon athwa khuli nahar ke dwaara bijligharon main prayukt kiya ja sake
 Both rain and land have to be studied to find the suitable place
 band aisi jagah banaaya jaataa he jahaan nunatam mulya main bana band adhiktam pani jamaa kar sake
 For this the natural condition of the place should be such that a river passes through a narrow path between the mountains passing through the valley, so that the dam can be converted into a large reservoir by making a dam at the narrowest place
 band ke upar ek or agratal banaaya jaataa he, jahaan se pani khuli nahar athwa nalon dwaara bijlighar tak le jaaya jaataa he
 This water drives large turbines located in the power plant, generating electric power in the planned generators
 tarabine, cement kancreet ke bane drafttub ke mukh par avasthit hota he
 The water rotates the blades of the turbine as it occurs in the guide vane and thus uses its inherent energy to drive the turbine
 chalate hue tarabine kii yantric urja vidyut urja main roopantarit kar di jaati he or is prakaar jal main nihit urja jalavidyut kaa rup le leti he
 After the turbine thus uses the power contained in the water, the water passes through the draft-tube to the immersion pool, from where it then flows back into the river
 draft-tub kii banaavat aisi hoti he ki pani kii shesh urja dhire dhire samaapt ho jaae, jisase baahar aane par nadi ke kinaaron ko kshatigrast na kare
 The energy contained in water depends on its volume and top
 sheersh ke anuroop jalavidyut yojanaon ko teen bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he : 1
 High top plan - more than about 200 meters
 2
 madhyam sheersh yojana - 50 meter se 200 meter tak
 3
 Low top plan - less than 50 meters
 yojana kaa aakaar evam praroop donon hi sheersh ke upar nirbhar karata he or usee ke anusaar uske tarabinon kaa praroop bhi
 Thus Francis turbine and paston cycles are suitable for high head
 madhyam sheersh ke liye shravak pravaahvale daab tarabine prayukt kiye jate hai
 Propellant type turbine is more suitable for lower head
 ucch sheershawali yojanaon main, saadharantaya, pani kaa aaytan adhik nahin hota
 Therefore, water is transported by taps to the runner's vaults from the turbine pool, enabling the energy contained in the water to drive the runner
 tund dwaara pani ke pawah or gati kaa niyantran karne se tathaa baltiyon par chode janevaale pani ke kone kaa vicharan karne se tarabine ke nirgat kaa niyantran kiya ja saktaa he or is tarah janit honevaali vidyutshakti kaa bhi niyantran ho saktaa he
 It is also possible to vary the angle of buckets and both controls can be done automatically
 nodak praroop ke tarabine ke ranor main keval teen yaa chaar pankh hi hote hai
 They are made of heavy steel
 kam sheershawali yojanaon main bahudhaa pani kaa aaytan bahut adhik hota he 
 Therefore, it is not possible to take water in the taps and use an open drain
 bhaar ke anuroop nirgat praapt karne ke liye tarabine main janevaale pani kii maatra kaa vicharan karnaa aavashyak hota he, jo dwaar khulaai dwaara sampadit kiya jaataa he
 These gate guides are like a crescent and their position controls the water
 baari hone ke kaaran ye dwaar dravchaalit daab dwaara pravartit kiye jate hai
 Just as the angle of the guide panes, or buckets, of the Pelton cycle is rotated, they can also be introduced automatically
 swat: chaalit vicharan sarvo motor dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It is a small motor that rotates the hydraulic pressure
 iskaa nivesh tarabine ke nirgat kaa hi ek ansh hota he, at: uske anusaar vicharan karata he
 Thus, the work done by this motor depends on the output of the turbine, which corresponds to the load on it, and automatically controls the guide nettle, or opened by it, by subtracting the hydraulic pressure
 Is, or arranges the angles of buckets
 nodak praroop kii tarabine main caplen praroop kaa tarabine mukhya he
 Its specialty is its strong and high efficiency
 isaki duusari visheshta yah he ki bhaar vicharan se dakshata par bahut kam prabhaav hota he, jiske kaaran vicharanshil bhaar ke liye yah tarabine bahut hi upyukt hota he
 In medium head plans, in general, a mixed turbine is more commonly used, but its selection depends more on the top of the head
 pani ko tarabine main le jane ke liye sthir guide len kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Its output is varied by the variance of its angle
 kam sheershawala tarabine, saadharantaya, khule shashift ke upar sthit hota he
 They are surrounded by a spiral type of casing, allowing water to be carried by a uniform guide guide
 ucch sheershawale tarabine main yah aavaran dhaatu kaa bana hota he
 Turbines can be both horizontal and vertical
 parantu saamanyat:, urdhwadhar hi adhik prayog main aata he
 These have specific types of bearings, which also have to bear the distinguished lateral shock on the machine
 isliye inhen aghat vering kehete hai
 Lubrication of bearings and other moving parts is also a difficult problem in itself
 iske liye daab snehan vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In this, the lubricant oil is pressed and sent to the lubricating places
 tel pump dwaara daab utpann kii jaati he
 There is also a system of automatically shutting down the machine, so that it does not get damaged in such a situation
 snehak tel ko saaf karne ke liye ek tel filter hota he or snehan ke pashchaat garam ho janevaale tel kaa thandha karne ke liye tel sheetak kii bhi vyavastha rahati he
 His position is of paramount importance in hydroelectric schemes
 inaki sthiti, mukhyat:, prakritik evam bhautik kaarnon par nirbhar karti he
 Roughly 10 MW of power would be available if a hydroelectric scheme provided a top of 150 feet with a flow of 1,000 cubic feet per second
 jalashay kaa anumaan bhi is aadhaar par lagaaya ja saktaa he, ki 1
13 varg mile ke kshetrafal main 1 foot pani keval 1 ghan foot prati second kaa pravaah utpann karata he
 Therefore, to get a flow of 1,000 cubic feet per second, the reservoir must have an average of 10 square feet of water over an area of 113 square miles
 kisi bhi jalavidyut yojana ko vyaavhaarik hone ke liye vah aavashyak he ki adhik se adhik sheersh evam pravaah ho
 Low-top schemes can only be practical when the flow of water is sufficient
 ucch sheershawali yojanaayen kam pravaah par bhi vyaavhaarik ho sakati he
 It is not mandatory for the power house to be near the dam
 jalashay pahaad par ho saktaa he or adhik sheersh paane ke liye bijlighar pahaad kii talahati main banaaya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, large tubes of water are transported to the power station
 ucch sheersh vaali yojanaayen saamanyat: isi praroop kii hoti hai
 In many places the water is transported to another power station in the hill by cutting the hill
 bijlighar kaa prithvital par hona bhi anivaary nahin
 Many power stations are also inside the earth and can be accessed only by lift
 mathan main bhi aisa hi bhumigat bijlighar banaaya gaya he
 Such power houses are of the automatic type and operated from the ground floor by remote control
 yadhyapi ye bijlighar mukhyat: prakritik kaarnon se hi prithvi ke andar banaae jate hai, tathaapi ye samrik drushtikon se surakshit hone ke kaaran bahut mahatvapurn hote hai
 There are many low-end schemes in our country
 ganga evam sharada naharon ke upar bahut se bijlighar banaae gaye hai, jinamein keval 20 se 30 foot ke sheersh kaa hi upyog kiya gaya he
 These schemes have become feasible due to high water flow
 jalavidyut yojanaayen, mukhyat:, norge, sweden, switsraland, germany, france, canada, rus evam america main hai
 India is also not far behind in hydroelectric schemes and some of the schemes here are counted among the world's greatest schemes, such as bhakra-nangal, Damodar Valley, Rihand, Hirakund, Nagarjuna Sagar, Koyna, Shivasamudram, Periyar etc
 bahut si jalavidyut yojanaayen bahuddeshiy bhi hoti hai
 These are mainly included with irrigation and flood prevention schemes, so that all-round development of the area can be done
 america main tennesi ghati nigam ke aadhaar par bharat main bhi damodar ghati nigam kii sthapana kii gai
 Many important hydroelectric schemes have been made in the last twenty years and plans are being made after studying the hydroelectric potential everywhere
 jalavidyut yojana main, yadhyapi, aarambh main bahut adhik vyay hota he, tathaapi tab bhi parichaalan vyay kam hone ke kaaran adhikansh yojanaayen aarthik drushtikon se safal hoti hai
 The life of their plant is also relatively much longer
 inkaa mukhya dosha vastav main inaki upabhokta sthanon se duuri he
 These plans cannot be made for wherever they are
 udaahranarth, yadi shakti kii maang kalkatte main he, to vahaan jalavidyut yojana karyanvit karnaa sambhav nahin
 The rivers originating from the Himalayas contain immense water power, but there is no demand for power
 is prakaar jalavidyut yojana dwaara janit vidyut shakti ko bahudhaa bahut duuri tak preshit karnaa hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to incur the expenditure of the remittance system for a comparative study of the hydroelectric scheme
 tab bhi adhikanshat: jalavidyut hi sasti padati he
 The Geneva Conventions include four treaties and three additional protocols that establish the standards of international law for the humane treatment of war

 pashu ke prati poojya bhaavana athwa is bhaavana se aacharon tathaa krityon kaa paalan pashupuja he
 In these terms, animalism would also become a symbol of the offspring of that caste or person due to the reverence of any caste or person
 pashusambandhi anek aacharon kaa prachlan sansar ke vibhinn bhaagon main dur-dur tak he
 But not all of these conducts are done with worship
 puja ke liye poojya ke prati shraddha or uske dwaara shubhta evam kalyaan kii kaamana mukhya visheshtaayen hai
 According to ethos, various categories of animal worship are made
 in kotiyon ke aadhaar par unke sampradaayon ko vargeekrut kiya jaataa he or ye vargeekaran bhi un sampradaayon main prachlit puja kii mul bhaavana par aadhaarit hota he
 Exploring the primitive form of this feeling makes it necessary to search for the root causes of the faith of the then human
 kintu ek to aadim pashupuja ke krityon or aacharon ke peeche nihit bhaavana ko thik-thik jaanane kaa saadhan uplabdh nahin he, duusare, aadhunik maanav kii man: sthiti tabase nitant bhinn he
 Therefore, based on the sentiments and categories of modern animalism, only possible approaches to the root cause of primitive animalism can be presented which can be utilitarian and divine or non-material
 itihaas purv ateet kaa andhkarayugin maanav aaj kii apeksha pashuon ke ati nikat tha
 This closeness can also result in intimacy and associative utility, and on the contrary it can prove fatal, fearful and catastrophic for them
 inhen sambhaavnaaon ke anusaar upyogetavaadi drushtikon dwividh hai - bhay athwa aatmarakshamulak or swarthmulak
 According to fear or self-protective utilitarian approach, man always bowed down to the cruelty and terror of many beings, and was revered towards them so that he could protect them from them
 pracheen misr main pavitra ghadiyal ko chaara khilaane kii pratha thi or aadhunik kaal main aisi hi pratha pashchimi africa main pai jaati he
 Possibly this practice may have been practiced in the spirit of autism on the consequences of loss from hungry gongs in primitive society
 lekin ham ise ghadiyal kii puja nahin kah sakate kyonki isse shraddha kaa sambandh nahin he
 According to the self-oriented utilitarian approach, animal behavior is done in a purely selfish manner so that food is available in the form of a meat of a bull
 aaharkhoji aadim maanav jab puri tarah maansaahaari na rahaa or shaakaahaari hokar ann aadi par bhi nirbhar rahane laga tab kuch pashuon kaa sambandh dharti kii urvarashakti se jud gaya
 This is the result of Sarpapuja, as he is a resident of the Hades where the water received from which crops and flora are irrigated and thus by his grace various food items are available in the form of medicines, grains and property
 kintu kul milakar devtaa athwa divya shaktiyon se par, vishuddh rup se aatmaraksha yaa swaarth kii drushti se pashu ke prati kii janevaali swatantra adarabhaavana kaa arth puja nahin he
 Similarly, the reverential nomenclature of the bone of the animal or respectful naming of the living animal is the result of a different approach from animal worship
 amal main pashupuja sambandhi daivi athwa abhautik drushtikon hi puja bhaavana kaa mul kaaran ho saktaa he
 Some cults of animal worship developed based on the belief that some animals have an unrelated relationship with divine powers or deities and that the deity concerned may be appeased by veneration of the animal
 kuch pashu apane swabhaav kii visheshtaon ke anuroop prakruti kii tadwat visheshtaon vaali shaktiyon ke pratik maan liye gaye
 Antiquities and mythological legends were also made in relation to them
 bharat main pashupuja aatma ke vibhinn yoniyon main janm grahan karne ke siddhant se sambadhit he
 Some cults of animal worship also started due to the belief that the ancestors of humans take birth in animal husbandry after death
 is drushti se pashupuja un vishwaason yaa manyataon par aadhaarit he jinke dwaara "divyapashu" kii kalpana charitaarth hoti he
 Thus the notion of great powers of nature, ancestors, deities or creatures of divine creation is embodied in the animal form with which the combination of fear and selfish attitude is successive
 pashupuja asaamaanya tathaa vyapak rup se mistra main prachlit hui
 There were almost all the main characters of animal worship in which some animal worship was zonal and some universal
 iske vipareet kuch anchalon main poojit pashu duusare anchalon main ghrinaa kaa paatr bhi tha
 This spirit of animal husbandry grew so much that even those who knew or unknowingly killed them were given the death penalty

 Most Indian people who believe in ancient Vedic traditions, consider many animals sacred as vehicles of the Gods and Goddesses
 pashuon kii pavitrataa vishyak is dharna kaa totum vaad nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Animals are not considered sacred because they are related to human beings, but because they have been used and used by various gods and goddesses as vehicles
 durga or singh, shiv or vrishabh, ganesh or chuha, karthik or mayur, lakshmi or ullu, saraswati or hans or isi prakaar anya devi devtaa kramash: anya pashu pakshiyon se sambandhit maane gaye hai

 In addition to these English papers, letters were published in Bangla, Urdu etc
 but the scope was limited

 10 may 1829 ko bengal se hindi akhbaar 'bangadoot' kaa prakaashan hua
 This letter also became the voice of the people and a medium to keep them connected
 iske baad july, 1854 main shyamsundar sen ne kalakatta se ‘samachar sudhaa varshan’ kaa prakaashan kiya
 During that time, any newspaper or newspaper published any news or article against the British Government, it had to pay its price
 akhabaaron ko pratibandhit kar diya jaataa tha
 Its copies were burnt, its publishers, editors, writers were punished
 un par baari-bharkam jurmaana lagaaya jaataa tha, taaki wo dubaara phir uthne kii himmat na juta paaen
 As the wave of independence was spreading across the country, newspapers were also becoming more and more tolerant of atrocities
 yahi vajah thi ki bengal vibhaajan ke uparaant hindi patron kii aawaaj or buland ho gai
