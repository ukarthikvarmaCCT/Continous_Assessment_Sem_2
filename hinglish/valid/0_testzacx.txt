 Agoraphobia) is an anxiety disorder
 janaatank vahaan utpann ho saktaa he jahaan ek bhayakrant hamalaa hone kaa aisa dar he jisase kisi bhi tarah se bachane kii ummid nahin hoti
 vaikalpik rup se, saamaajik chintaa kii samasyaayein bhi ek aadharbhoot kaaran ho sakati hai
 As a result, people with agoraphobia avoid public and / or unfamiliar places, especially in large, open, empty spaces, such as shopping malls or airports, where there are few places to hide
 kai maamalon main, peedit apane yaa apane ghar tak hi simit ho saktaa he, jahaan use is surakshit jagah se kahin or jane main kathinaayee kaa anubhav hota he
 Although in most cases there is a fear of public spaces, it is now believed that agoraphobia develops as complications of a panic attack
 haalanki, saboot maujuud hai ki DSM-IV main sahaj bhayakrant hamale or janaatank ke bich jo ek ekatarfa karnatmak rishta lakshith hota he, vah galat ho saktaa he
 About 3
2 million adults or 2
2% of people between the ages of 18 and 54 in the US suffer from agoraphobia
 janaatank, jise agraphobia nahin samajha janaa chahie, ek aisi dasha he jahaan peedit vaise parivesh main vyakul ho jaataa he jo ki uske liye aparichit hota he yaa jahaan peedit ko aisa mahasoos hota he ki uske haathon main niyantran nahin he
 Activating this concern may include wide open spaces, crowds, or travel
 janaatank aksar ek saamaajik pareshaaniyon ke bhay se sanyojit hota he lekin aisa hameshaa nahin hota, kyonki agoraphobic bhay kii shuruuaat jan saadhaaran main bhayakrant hamale or pareshaani se hoti he
 It is sometimes called 'social agoraphobia' which can be a type of social anxiety disorder sometimes called 'social phobia'
 haalanki sabhi janaatank ke lakshan saamaajik nahin hote hai
 Some people with agoraphobia have fear of open spaces
 janaatank ko "un logon dwaara ek bhay, kabhi-kabhi bhayanak bhay ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jinhone ek yaa ek se adhik bhayakrant hamale kaa saamana kiya he
 "in such cases, the victim is afraid of a particular place, as he had experienced a panic attack at the same place last time
 ek or bhayakrant hamale ko jhelane se bachane ke liye peedit bhaybheet ho jaataa he yaa us sthaan par jane se bachataa he
 This type of victim is now considered to have agoraphobia
 kabhi-kabhi peedit us sthaan se bachane ke liye har prakaar se koshish kar sakate hai jahaan par pehle bhayakrant hamale kaa saamana kiya gaya tha
 Agoraphobia, described in this manner, is actually a professional symptom checkup at the time of diagnosis of panic disorder
 atyant grasit badhyakaari vikaar yaa uttar abhighatj tanaav vikaar jaise sanglakshan bhi janaatank ke kaaran ho sakate hai, mularoop se koi bhi niraadhaar bhay jo ek vyakti ko baahar jane se roktaa he, iske lakshanon ko utpann kar saktaa he
 Agoraphobia related to travel distance basically consists of three levels of strictness that are not currently included in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
 pehle str ke janaatank main ek kshetra kii saamaanya paridhi jahaan vah rahata he uske pare yatra ke parinaam ke rup main ek kalpanaatmak bhay yaa vaastavik bhayakrant hamalaa shaamil he, jaise ek bada shahar yaa desh
 Second level agoraphobia involves an imaginary fear or a real panic attack as a result of a journey beyond the normal perimeter of a neighborhood or residential district where it lives
 tisare str ke janaatank main kisi ke awaas kii simaaon yaa parisaron ke baahar jane ke parinaam ke rup main ek kalpanaatmak bhay yaa vaastavik bhayakrant hamalaa shaamil hota he
 Most of the victims of this category are able to walk outside the verandah, balcony, terrace, courtyard or courtyard, but the third level minority victims are afraid to go out of it
 duusare str or tisare str ke janaatank se peedit vyakti ke liye bhi vishesh taur par asthaayee pruthakkaran chintaa vikaar se us vakt peedit hona asaamaanya nahin hota jab us ghar ke anya sadsy asthai rup se kahin chale jate hai, jaise mata-pita yaa pati-patni yaa janaatank se peedit vyakti ghar main akelaa hota he
 
 Such temporary situations may result in increased anxiety or panic attacks
 janaatank kaa ek or saarvajanik saahchary vikaar mrityu bhay rog he - mrityu kaa bhay
 atatah mar jane ke vichaar se janaatank se peedit vyakti ke chintaa str main aksar vruddhi ho jaati he, jise ve jaanboojhkar yaa anjaane main antat nashwar bhaavnaatmak aashwaasan or suraksha kshetron or priyajanon se antim judaai ke vichaaron se jodate hai, yahaan tak ki unke liye bhi jo anyathaa aadhyatmik rup se jivan pashchaat astitv ke kuch roopon par vishwaas karte hai
 The way agoraphobia occurs in men, it is almost twice as high as in women
 langik antar ko un saamaajik-saanskrithik karkon ke falswaroop mana ja saktaa he jo mahilaon ko algaav niyantran ranneetiyon kii adhik abhivyakti karne ke liye protsaahit yaa anumati detaa he
 Other theories include the idea that women seek more help and can therefore be diagnosed and that men are more prone to alcohol addiction in response to extreme anxiety and are diagnosed as an alcoholic and traditional Female sexual roles encourage women to engage in dependent and helpless behavior in response to panic
 anusandhanon ke parinaamon main abhi tak agoraphobia main ling bhed ke liye koi bhi spasht vyakhya nahin milti
 The exact cause of agoraphobia is still unknown, although some physicians offer valid theories that have treated or attempted to treat agoraphobia
 is haalat main anya dushchintaa vikaar, ek tanaavpurn vaataavaran yaa nashe kii upasthiti ko joda gaya he
 Long-term use of benzodiazepines such as tranquilizers and sleeping pills has been linked to causes of agoraphobia
 jab benzodiazepins nirbharta kaa ilaaj kiya jaataa he or parhez kii ek avadhi ke baad, janaatank ke lakshan dhire-dhire kam ho jate hai
 Research has revealed an association between difficulties in spatial orientation and agoraphobia
 janaatank se mukt vyakti apane karn kotor pranali, drishy pranali or apni pragrahi bodh ke sangyojan dwaara santulan banane main sakasham hote hai
 a disproportionate number of agoraphobia have weak aural cotransplants and rely more on visual or tactile cues
 vistrut khule sthaan yaa baari bheed ke rup main jab drishy sanket kam ho jate hai, ve asantulit ho sakate hai
 Likewise, they can also be confused by oblique or irregular surfaces
 niyantran kii tulana main, abhaasi vaastaviktaa adhyayan main janaatank se grasiton ne ausat rup se badalte shravy-drishy aankadon ke nunikrut sansaadhan ko darshaya
 Some scholars have described agoraphobia as an attachment deficiency, that is, the ability to tolerate spatial isolation from a safe place is temporarily reduced
 haal ke anubhavjanya anusandhan ne bhi janaatank ke anulgnak or sthanik siddhanton ko joda he
 There is an alleged clinical bias in agoraphobia research in the social sciences
 saamaajik vigyaan kii shakhaaen, khaskar bhugol kii jis pahalu kii taraf ruchi badi he use sthanik ghatana ke rup main mana ja saktaa he
 a similar approach links the development of agoraphobia to modernity
 zyaadaatar log jo maansik swasthya visheshgyon ke paas jate hai unamem bhayakrant vikaar ke shuru hone ke baad janaatank viksit hota he 
 janaatank ko baarambaar bhayakrant hamale ke pratikul vyavhaarik parinaam ke rup main behatar samajha ja saktaa he or in hamalon ke saath baad kii chintaa or purvavyastata ke kaaran grasit vyakti waisi paristhitiyon se bachane kii koshish karata hai jahaan bhayakrant hamalaa hone kii sambhaavna ho sakati he
 In some rare cases where the diagnosis of panic disorder of a person with agoraphobia does not meet the criteria, a formal diagnosis of agoraphobia is made without a history of panic disorder
 janaatank ke rogiyon ko achaanak bhayakrant hamale kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he, jab ve aise sthanon kii yatra karte hai jahaan unhen yah bhay hota he ki ve niyantran se baahar hai, yaa unhen madad nahin mil sakati, yaa ve sharminda ho sakate hai
 During an attack, epinephrine is secreted in large amounts and activates the body's natural response to fight or escape
 ek bhayakrant hamalaa, aam taur par achaanak shuru hota he or 10 se 15 minute ke bheetar adhik se adhik teevr ho jaataa he or shaayad hi kabhi 30 minute se adhik tak chalata he
 Symptoms of a panic attack include hypertension, rapid heart rate, sweating, trembling, vomiting, dizziness, tightness in the throat, and shortness of breath
 kai rogiyon ne mrityu ke bhay yaa bhaawanaaon or / yaa vyavhaar par niyantran khone kii baat kahi he
 Exposure treatment can provide permanent relief to most patients with agoraphobia and panic attacks
 sirf bhayakrant hamalon kii bajaay, avshisht or upanidanik janaatank algaav kii vilupti, expozar chikitsa kaa lakshya hona chahie
 isi prakaar, vyavasthit visugrahikaran kaa bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Cognitive restructuring has also proved useful for treating agoraphobia
 is upachaar main pratibhaagi ko dianotic charchaa ke madhyam se koching dena shaamil he, jiske tahat adhik tathyaatmak or laabhakaari vishwaason dwaara niraadhaar or baadhak vishwaason ko pratisthapit karnaa lakshya hota he
 Relaxation techniques are often useful in agoraphobia, as they can be used to prevent or eliminate symptoms of anxiety and attack
 chintaa vikaron ke ilaaj ke liye sabase aam rup se istemaal avsaad-virdohi dawaaen mukhya rup se SSRI varg main hai or jisamen certaline, peroxitine or fluxotine shaamil he
 Benzodiazepine tranquilizers, MAO inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants are also commonly prescribed for the treatment of agoraphobia
 ai muvament disencytigeshan and programing kaa adhyayan ek janaatank ke sambhavit ilaaj ke liye kiya gaya he, lekin parinaam santoshjanak nahin the
 By the way, EMDR is recommended in cases where cognitive behavioral approaches prove ineffective or cases where agoraphobia develops later
 chintaa vikaar se grasit kai log swayan sahaayta yaa sahaayta samooh main shaamil hokar labhaavanvit hote hai 
 samasyaon or uplabdhiyon ko ek-dusron ke saath aadan-pradaan karne ke saath-saath swayan-sahaayta upkarnon ko saajha karnaa in samoohon kii saamaanya gatividhiyaan hai
 In addition to stress management techniques and various types of meditation practice, psychodynamic techniques can help calm patients with anxiety disorders and increase the effectiveness of therapy

png surabhedi bhashaa aisi bhashaa ko kaha jaataa he jisamen awaz ke sur ke badlaav ke aadhaar par shabdon or vaakyon kaa arth badal jaataa ho
 The Chinese language is the Surabhedi language spoken by most of the people of the world
 bharat main punjabi or dogri jaisi pashchimi pahari bhashaayen surabhedi hoti hai
 To some extent, emotions are communicated through notes in every language, but the meaning of words with the same characters varies only with the letters in the Surabhedi languages
 angreji main surabhedi bhashaaon ko "tonal langvejiz" kehete hai
 The meaning of the word "ma" in Chinese depends on the change of tone - agar suron ke badlaav ko tiron se dikhaaya jaae, to chini kii ek pankti is prakaar ho sakati he - If someone is not used to the Surabhedi languages, then he will only feel "mama ma ma de ma ma" in this line
 use lagegaa ke ek hi "maa" shabd baar-baar doharaaya ja rahaa he jabaki alag-alag suron kii vajah se vastav main yahan paanch alag shabd kahe ja rahe hai
 Similarly, in Punjabi, the notes are used - dhyaan rahe ke inhen punjabi kii donon lipiyon main alag-alag likhaa jaataa he, lekin inkaa uccharan ek-sa hota he
 Punjabi can be asked "whip, whip?" - If their notes are spoken properly, it means "horse, whip, or bitter" to Punjabi mothers
 It will be understood when it is possible that non-punjabis have been told that the same word has been said three times

 sukhoi esayu-12 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan soviet sangh dwaara viksit jasusi vimaan kaa ek prototip tha
 Data from Shavrov saamaanya lakshan Display ambush marketing yaa ghaat vipanan ko ek aisi vipanan ranneeti ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jisamen vigyapandaata kisi praayojan shulk kaa bhugtan kiye bina hi kisi kaarykram vishesh ke saath apane aap ko jod lete hai or is prakaar isse laabh praapt karte hai
 The Macmillan English dictionary defines ambush marketing as a marketing strategy in which a competing brand associates itself with a major sporting event without paying a sponsorship fee
 mekakarthi ke anusaar, ghaat vipanan ek company dwaara vipanan kaa aisa prakaar he jo kisi aayojan kaa aadhikarik praayojak nahin he, parantu jo aayojan kaa upyog karke vigyaapan karata he, taaki graahak kaa dhyaan vigyaapan kii ore aakarshith kiya ja sake
 From a theoretical perspective, in ambush marketing, the company attempts to capitalize on its popularity, credibility and reputation by associating itself with a particular event, while not agreeing to the party required for it
 ambush marketing main prayukt shabd "ambush" kaa arth he, "ghaat lagaakar hamalaa" or isaki vyutpatti ek puraani francisi kriya ambusier se hui he, jiskaa arth he "ek jangal main rakhana"
 shabd "ambush marketing" ko prasiddh vipanan ranneetijna jeri welsh dwaara diya gaya, jab ve 1980 ke dashak main american express company ke liye vishwastareey vipanan prayaason ke manager ke rup main kaary kar rahe the
 Direct ambush marketing isamen kuch aisi chijen shaamil hai jaise khel sanghathan kii anumati ke bina ek khel main muft tii-sharts baantnaa
aisa bhi saktaa he ki brands pehle se stadium ko apane chinhon se cover kar de, yaa sanghathan ne kisi or brands ko tii sharts baantne kii anumati di he
 In any case, it reduces the space of marketing, hindering the activities of the brand that the organization permits and thus creating a breach in official sponsorship
 apratyaksh ghaat vipanan Surprise ambush marketing graahak yah soch kar aage aa jate hai ki company is aayojan kii aadhikarik praayojak he
 Their goal at this time is to take advantage of the increased attention of media and television audiences around the event, to capitalize on it
 praayojakon kii badhati laagat: praayojakon kii badhati laagat ne nivesh-par-ritern par praayojak ke prabhaav ko badha diya he
 If the sponsored events do not display the feature, the sponsor's interest on the sponsoring property will be lost and this will harm the entire purpose market
 So whenever this exclusivity is lost, the value of sponsorship is also lost
 jab ek company ghaat vipanan main sanlagn hoti he, praayojak ke liye praayojan kaa phayda khatm ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the importance of sponsorship also decreases
 kyonki yah ek nirvivaad tathy he ki corporate praayojan, aayojan kii vayavastha karne waalon ke liye rajasav ke sabase bade paisa banane vaale sroton main se ek he, praayojan ke mulya main kshati aayojan kii vyavastha karne vaale kii vittiya prabalata ko prabhavit karegi
 Crimes on Intellectual Property Rights: Although ambush marketers are not directly related to protected intellectual property rights, they infringe on intellectual property rights in an effort to capitalize on the hard-earned credibility earned by organizing
 aayojan yaa aayojan ke pratik ke saath pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh sambandh, ayojlan kii vayavastha karne waalon ke adhikaron par gaiyr-kanoonee atikaraman he
 Also, sponsors do not get the anticipated results

 a computer file is a class of information collected, or a resource for storing information that is available to a computer program, and is usually based on some kind of durable computer storage
 sanchika tikaoo is lihaaz se hoti he ki yah maujuuda kaarykram ke samaapt hone ke baad bhi anya kaaryakramon dwaara istemaal ke liye maujuud rahati he
 Computer files can traditionally be considered the modern form of paper documents contained in files from offices and libraries, which is why the file is named in English
 nunatam str par kai aadhunik prachaalan pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko keval ek-aiami biton kii shrunkhlaa hi maanati hai
 At a more high level, when the contents of the file are also kept in view, these binomial digits may be considered representing integers, letters, image pixels, sounds, or anything else
 yah sanchika kaa istemaal karne vaale kaarykram par nirbhar he ki vah kis prakaar sanchika kaa arth nikaalata he or jaankaree ke aantarik jamaav ko kaise samajhataa he, taaki prayokta ko or adhik myne rakhane vaali style main isi jaankaree ko prastut kar sake 
 At any given time, the file will have a shape, usually expressed in bytes, and indicate how much space the file has in store
 adhiktar aadhunik prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah aakaar koi bhi arunatmak purnank ho saktaa he, lekin pranali ke anusaar isaki adhiktam seemaa hogi
 But the simple definition of a file does not preclude that its current size has any real meaning, except in the case when the contents of the file are some of the contents within a set of persistent collections
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi unics-samaan pranali main jis sanchika kii ore / bin / ls kii kadi ingit karti he, uskaa aakaar paribhaashit hota he or virale hi badalata he
 Compare this to / dev / null, it is also a file but its size always changes but probably does not matter the same way as in the previous example
 kisi sanganak sanchika main maujuud jaankaree or choti jaankariyon ke pulindon ke rup main ho sakati he yaa chalneey bhi ho sakati he
 It only depends on the creator of the file how the information will be organized in it
 is kaaran se anekon kam maanak vaali sanchika dhaanche maujuud hai jo saralatam se jatiltam tak har prakaar ke makasad ke liye kaam aa sakate hai
 Most computer files are used by computer programs
 ye kaarykram apane istemaal ke liye yathochit sanchikaaye banaate, badalte va mitaate hai
 The program-makers who make these programs decide which files are needed, how they are to be used and their names
 kuch maamalon main sanganak kaarykram sanchikaon main her fer is dhang se karte hai ki ve sanganak prayokta ko dikhti hai
 For example, in the word-processing program, users make changes to document files and the user names them by themselves
 dastauez sanchika kii saamagree is tarah yojit hoti he ki shabd-sansaadhan kaarykram ko vah samaj main aa jaae, lekin prayokta hi uskaa naam va bhandaaran pataa nirdhaarit karata he or bhandaaran kii pramukh jaankaree bhi prayokta hi nirdhaarit karata he
 Many applications push all the content files into a single file and mark them inside to keep track of different types of information
 duum or quek jaise khelon kii saamagree sanchikaaye iskaa ek udhaaharan hai
 On the computer, it is possible to create, modify, extend, shrink, move, and delete files
 adhiktar maamalon main, sanganak kaaryakramon ko sanganak par chalaa kar yah sab kiya jaataa he, par zarurat ho to sanganak kaa prayokta bhi sanchikaon main badlaav kar saktaa he
 For example, Microsoft Word files are usually created by the Microsoft Word program based on user instructions, but the user can also delete, delete, or transfer these files directly through a file manager program such as Windows Explorer
 unics-jaisi pranaaliyon main prayokta-kshetra kii prakriyaayein aamtaur par sidhe sanchikaon se nahin ulajhati hai; prachaalan pranali ek pruthakkaran str pradaan karti he jisaki vajah se prayokta-kshetra kii ore se sanchikaon ke saath kaa lagbhag sara len-dein kathor kadiyon se hota he
 a file can be named by using rigid links; Purely operating systems do not have names of files
 udhaaharan ke liye prayokta-kshetra ke kaarykram kisi sanchika ko mitaa nahin sakate hai, ve keval us sanchika kii kadi ko mitaa sakate hai or yadi ashthi ko yah pataa lagata he ki is sanchika kii ab koi or kadiyaan nahin hai, to vah is sanchika ko mitaa saktaa he
 In fact, only the layer transacts through files, but user-zone requests are done through files in such a way that it remains unknown to user-zone programs
 yun to kaaryakramon kaa sanchikaon ke saath kaa len-dein prachaalan pranali or sanchika pranali ke hisaab se alag alag hota he par mukhyatah yah gatividhiyaan aam hai: In modern computer systems, filenames are commonly used to access files
 kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah naam sanchika se judaa hota he
 In some others, the file itself is anonymous, but named links point to it
 is maamle main prayokta kadi ko hi sanchika kaa naam samaj saktaa he, lekin yah vastav main sahi nahin hoga, khaastaur par jab ek hi sanchika kii ek se adhik kadiyaan hon tab
 The files can be in directories
 lekin behatar yah kahana hoga ki nirdeshika ke andar sanchikaon kii suchi yaa sanchikaon kii kadiyon kii suchi ho sakati he
 Under this definition it is very important to understand that the term "file" also includes directories
 isse nirdeshikaon ke sopan sambhav hote hai, arthath nirdeshikaon ke andar upanirdeshikas
 The name that refers to a file inside a directory must be unique
 lekin kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main naam ke saath prakaar bhi nirdisht hota he jisaki vajah se ek nirdeshika main do alag alag prakaar kii sanchikaayen ek hi naam se sambhav hai jaise ki ek hi naam kii ek nirdeshika va ek sanchika
 In environments in which files are named, the pair of file names and paths must be unique - the names and paths of any two files cannot match the names and paths of any other file
 jahaan sanchika benaam ho, namit sandarbh ek namasthaan ke antargat rahenge
 Most times a name in any namespace will refer to exactly one or zero files
 lekin, koi bhi sanchika kisi namasthaan main shunya, ek yaa adhik naamon se sanderbhit kii ja sakati he
 Depending on the context of the application, the appropriate name for any file or link must be made up of special characters
 sanganak pranali par nirbhar karata he ki yah naam upyukt he yaa nahin
 Early computers allowed a limited number of letters and numbers in a file's name, but modern computers allow long names to contain Unicode characters or Unicode numbers in almost any order, so that the purpose of the file is understood at a glance
 
 kuch sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon main khaali sthaan kii anumati dete hai, kuch nahin
 The ephemeral sensitivity of file names is determined by the file system
 unics sanchika pranaliyaan aamtaur par laghudirghasanvedi hoti hai or prayokta-stareey anuprayogon ko aisi sanchikaaye banane detii hai jinke aksharon main keval laghu or deergh kaa fark ho
 Microsoft Windows offers several file systems, with different policies for short-term sensitivity
 yadi prayokta nirdeshika pravishtion main sanchika naamon ko badalane ke liye discs sampadak kaa istemaal kare to prachlit effeti pranali main kai sanchikaaye ho sakati hai jinke naam main keval deergh-laghu aksharon kaa hi fark ho
 However, user applications generally do not allow this
 adhiktar sanganak, sanchikaon ko sopan ke aadhaar par yojit karte hai or iske liye folder, nirdeshika yaa kaitlog kaa istemaal karte hai
 Whatever the word, the idea is the same
 har folder main kuch sankhya main sanchikaaye ho sakati hai or unamem anya folder ho sakate hai
 These other folders are called subfolders
 inamen or sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai, aadi-aadi, aise kar ke ek vriksh-rupi dhaanchaa nirmit hota he jisamen ek "guru folder" yaa hota he jiske adheen kitne bhi str tak sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai
 Folders can also have names like files
 folderon ke jariye sanchikaon ko taarkik tareeke se yojit karnaa saral ho jaataa he
 Whenever a computer uses folders, each file and folder has not only its own name but also a path that indicates which folder or folders the file or folder is present in
 is path main ek vishesh chihn - jaise ki / - ko jariye sanchika yaa folder naamon ke bich main likhaa jaataa he
 For example in the example in this article, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers indicates that a file named Managers is in a folder called Salaries, and this folder is in Payroll
 sanchika or folder ke naamon ke bich main aage jhuki lakeer he, sarvocch yaa jad folder kaa koi naam nahin he, atah naam aage jhuki lakeer se shuru hota he 
 Many computer systems use extensions in file names, also called file types
 windos sanganakon main vistaar sanchika ke naam ke baad ek bindu or bindu ke aage kuch akshar kaa rup letaa he, ye akshar sanchika ke prakaar kii pahchaan hote hai
 The 
txt extension is the identity of the text file, the 
doc extension is the identity of a document, especially in Microsoft Word file format; Etc
 etc
 sanganak pranali par vistaaron kaa istemaal hone par bhi, sanganak pranali unhen kis had tak pahachaanata he or kis had tak unke anusaar vyavhaar karata he, isamen bhi kaafii vividhta he, kuch pranaaliyon main ye anivaary hai, jabaki kuch or main inke maujuud hone se bhi koi fark nahin padataa, ye nazarandaz kar die jate hai
 Many modern computer systems provide ways to prevent files from getting damaged
 jo sanganak ek se adhik prayoktaaon kii suvidha dete hai ve sanchika anumatiyaan bhi lagu karte hai jinase yah niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he ki koun sanchikaaye va folder bana, mitaa yaa badal saktaa he or koun nahin
 For example, a user may have permission to change a file but not delete it, or to create files and folders but not delete it
 anumatiyon ke jariye yah bhi nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he ki keval kuch hi prayokta kisi sanchika yaa folder kii saamagree dekh saken
 Permissions protect against illegal alteration or destruction of content in files and illegal users can be prevented from viewing certain files to keep private information confidential
 kai sanganakon main ek or bachaav vidhi maujuud hoti he jise "keval pathneey chihn" kehete hai
 When this sign is placed, files can be inspected but cannot be changed
 yah chihn vikat jaankaree ke liye laabhadaayak hota he jise badla yaa mitaayaa nahin janaa chahie, jaise ki sanganak pranali ke aantarik purzon dwaara prayukt kuch vishesh sanchikaon ke liye
 Some systems also include a "hidden sign", which ensures that the file becomes invisible
 is chihn ke jariye sanganak pranali aisi zaruri pranali sanchikaon ko chhipaati he, jinhen prayoktaaon dwaara badla nahin janaa chahie
 In the above discussion, the file is described as a concept for a high level operating system or user
 lekin, kisi bhi sanchika ko vastav main kaam laayak hone ke liye bhautik rup se upasthit hona aavashyak he
 That is, the abstract concept of a file needs to be in the actual physical form in the real computer system, otherwise it does not have to exist
 bhautik rup se adhiktar sanganak sanchikaaye kisi prakaar ke saamagree bhandaaran upkaran main rakhi jaati hai
 Examples are hard jisc, through which most operating systems operate
 adhiktar sanchikaaye inhen main rakhi jaati hai
 Hard disks are the most widely available non-volatile storage device in the early 21st century
 yadi sanchikaon main keval asthaayee saamagree hi ho to unhen areem main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In operating systems like Unix, many files are not directly connected to any physical storage device: / dev / null is a prime example of this, likewise almost all of the files contained within / dev, / proc and / sys are of the same type
 
 inkaa prayokta kshetra main sanchikaon kii tarah prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 But these are virtual files that actually exist only as objects of the operating system's archetype
 sanganak sanchikaon ko chumbakeey pattayon main bhandaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases files can also be stored in other media such as writeable compact discs, digital multivariate disks, zip drives, USB flash drives, etc
 jab sanganak sanchikaon main bahut mahatvapurn jaankaree hote he to pratilipi prakriya ke jariye aisi sthitiyon ko parinaamon se bachane kii koshish kii jaati he jinamein sanchikaaye nasht ho sakati hai
 Copying files simply means keeping the copies of the files in another location so that if something happens to the original computer or they are accidentally erased, they can be returned by copy
 sanchikaon kii prati rakhane ke kai tareeke hai
 Most computer systems provide convenience programs that facilitate the copying process, as it can take a lot of time if many files are to be copied
 sanchikaon ko aksar lekhanyogy sidi yaa cartrij tepon jaise hastantaraneey madhyamon main pratilipit kiya jaataa he
 Copying files to another hard disk of the same computer protects against a malfunction of one disk, but if the entire computer is to be protected against the risk of malfunction or loss, it is necessary to make copies of those files in such medium Which can be taken away from this computer and stored in a safe place
 dada-baap-betaa pratilipi vidhi swachaalit rup se teen pratilipiyaan banaati he, sanchika kii sabase puraani prati dada sanchika hoti he or betaa maujuuda pratilipi
 The system of which files are organized, named, stored and changed by which computer is called its file system
 adhiktar prachaalan pranaaliyon main kam se kam ek sanchika pranali hoti he
 Multiple file systems can be run simultaneously in many operating systems
 udhaaharan ke liye, nae emes windos sanganakon par emes-dos ke puraane effeti-style kii sanchika pranaliyaan samarthit hai or saath hi taaze windos sanskarnon kii prachlit sanchika pranali antiatioes bhi chalati he
 Every system has its advantages and disadvantages
 udhaaharan ke liye maanak effeti main keval 8 akshar ke sanchika naam chalate hai, jabaki antiatioes main lambey sanchika naam sambhav hai jinamein khaali sthaan bhi ho sakate hai
 You can name a file in NTFS like Payroll records but in FAT this name can be something similar to payroll
dat
 sanchika prabandhak kaarykram suvidhadaayak kaarykram hote hai jinke jariye sanchikaon va folderon ko hilaayaa, banaaya, mitaayaa yaa punarnamit kiya ja saktaa he, par ye vastav main aapako sanchika kii saamagree ko padhane yaa saamagree jodne nahin dete hai
 Each computer system provides at least one file manager for its parent file system
 windos main sabase adhik prayukt sanchika prabandhak kaarykram windos explorer he or mike main yah finder he
 Linux has many file managers such as Nautilus, Conqueror
 sanchika ke liye prayukt angrezi shabd "fil" kaa sanganak bhandaaran ke sandarbh main prayog 1952 se hi chhidi pattiyon main sanchit jaankaree ke liye shuru ho gaya tha
 In the initial experiment, people used to call the underlying software only file
 udhaaharan ke liye ibiem 350 kii discs drivon ko "discs fil" kaha jaataa tha
 Systems such as the 1962 compatible time sharing system had file systems that displayed multiple "files" on a single cache device, and thus began the modern use of the term
 sitis ke sanchika naamon main do hisse the, ek prayokta-pathneey "pradhan naam" or doosraa "apradhan naam" jo sanchika kaa prakaar bataata tha
 This practice is still practiced by many operating systems, including Microsoft Windows

 He builds his story, which he focuses on his life as a landowner named "sir Fixalot" of medieval story and his rival "sir Butkissis"
 puri kahani ke dauraan bachche apni taraf se bhi kuch jodate rahete hai, jaise raja ne sar phicolot ko khud ko sabit karne kaa mauka diya
 utsav ke dauraan, patric kahata he ki gamballs kii barish ho rahi hai or kahani khatm ho jaati he
 The next day, Skeeter is called to fix Nottingham's television and upon his arrival, he tells Skeeter a "secret" topic called the rock and roll theme that is very similar to the Hard Rock Hotel , Which he announced at the hotel
 jab scater is par aapatti jaataa he to use candal ke saath pratispardhaa kar ke ek behatar vishay bataane ke avasar kii peshkash kii jaati he
 While driving, the skater is suddenly bombarded with gumballs, but he does not know that the cause is a crashed delivery truck
 scater nishkarsh nikaalata he ki kahani sach ho gayi thi or khud ko laabh pahunchane ke liye vah iskaa prayog turant ek yojana banane main karata he
 For the next story, he goes into detail about a Western subject in which he obtains a "ferrari" horse from an Indian headman
 bachche kahani kaa samarthan nahin karte lekin ek yuvati ko kai aparaadhiyon se bachaane ke liye kehete hai
 They say that if he kisses as a reward, the dwarf will kick him
 That night, Skeeter goes out in search of his Ferrari and meets a man, who steals his wallet

 skaticas dwaara ek aadmi ke jivan ko bachaane ke baad, ek toofaan use tathaa yuvati ko ek jaadui gupha main bhej detaa he, jisame abraham linkan hai
 The skater loses his patience during the story and makes the children angry
 kyonki ve aage jari rakhane main asamarth rahete hai, kahani samaapt hoti he
 The next day, Skeeter realizes that according to the story, Violet won't meet him, but he unexpectedly goes to Jill, who invites her to lunch
 scater kii hai skool kii ladkiyaan restaraan main hai, isliye scater jill se apni premika hone kaa naatak karne ke liye kahata he
 After the girls sing "hokey Pokey" and a skater on the beach saves a man carelessly, a sudden storm sends them to the dock where he realizes he loves her
 jaise hi ve chumban lene lagate hai, scater ko yaad aata he ki abi linkan prakat hone vaale hai or vah dur chalaa jaataa he
 Instead of this happening, an American penny ends the story, falling through the cracks of the dock
 scater or bacchon kii ek saath antim raat guzaarane ke dauraan, ek antariksh aadhaarit kahani shuru hoti he jisame scater kaa charitra candal ke charitra ke saath bina gurutvkarshan ke vayumandal main ladata he
 The skater's character who speaks a foreign obscure language wins and the skater quickly finishes the story
 patric toktaa he ki kahani bahut adhik jaani pahachaani he or kahata he ki kahani ke khatm hone se pehle scater bhasma ho jaataa he
 At Nottingham's birthday party, a bee stings his tongue while trying to avoid fire hazards by skater, making it difficult for him to understand while competing at Kendall's new Broadway themed hotel is

 She confesses that she has always been jealous of him and the stories made by her father and the entertainment she has done, which she has never been able to do herself, and she thought in mind that leaving the children to her Their habit of fun will be forced out
 When they go to protest the demolition, this prompts the skater to save the school from the demolition
