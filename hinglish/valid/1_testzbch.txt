 raat ko hi nadi paar karte hue, usne unhen aashcharyachakit kar diya or pehali ghudsavaar jhadap ke baad unki sena ko peeche hatane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 It was up to Alexander when the news reached that the king of Celsius, Illyria, and Gluaki, the king of Tualanti, were rebelling against him in the open
 vah pashchim main ilariria ki ore rukh kiya, sikandar ne ek ke baad ek dono ko haraane ke baad, dono shaskaon ko apni saina ke saath bhaagane ke liye majaboor kar diya

 The end of Thebes silenced Athens and temporarily brought peace to all of Greece
 tab sikandar antipeter ko raaj-pratinidhi ke rup main chhod, apane asian abhiyaan nikal gaya
 After Spitomenes' death and his new marriage to Roxena, Alexander moved his attention to the Indian subcontinent
 usne gandhar ke sabhi pramukhon ko aamantrit kar, unhen apane adhikaar kshetra sikandar ke adheen karne ke liye kaha
 Ambhi, the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus River to the Jhelum River, accepted it, but the chieftains of some hilly regions, including the Ashwanyas and Ashwakyanas of the Kamboj region, refused to oblige
 aambhi ne sikandar ko dosti kaa yakeen dilaane or unhen moolyawaan uphaaron dene, uske sabhi sena ke saad khud uske paas gaya
 Alexander not only returned him his rank and gifts, but he gifted Ambi "persian clothes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 gold talents"

 He is often respected as a great mathematician, mystic and scientist; However some question the possibilities of his contributions to mathematics and natural philosophy
 herodots unhen "unaniyon ke bich sabase adhik sakasham darshanik" maanate hai
 His name connects him to Pythia and Apollo; Aristippus clarified his name by saying that "they spoke no less true than the Pythians," and Lumblikas tells a story that Pythia predicted that her pregnant mother would give birth to a very beautiful, intelligent child who would go to mankind

 Pythagoras, known as the "father of numbers", made significant contributions to religious teaching and philosophy in the sixth century BCE
 purv sukaraati kaal ke anya logon kii tulana main unke kaary ne katha kahaniyon ko adhik prabhavit kiya, unke jivan or shikshaaon ke bare main adhik vishwaas ke saath kaha ja saktaa he
 We know that Pythagoras and his disciples believed that everything is related to mathematics and that numbers are ultimately the reality and that everything can be predicted through mathematics and everything is aligned in a rhythmic pattern or cycle
 Can be measured in the form
 lamblicas ke anusaar, pithogoras ne kaha ki "sankhya hi vichaaron or roopon kaa shaasha he or devataaon or rakshason kaa kaaran he
 " wo pehle aadmi the jo apane aap ko ek darshanik, yaa buddhi kaa premi kehete the, or pithogoras ke vichaaron ne plato par ek bahut gaharaa prabhaav daalaa
 Unfortunately, very few facts are known about Pythagoras, as very few of his writings remain
 pithogoras kii kai uplabdhiyaan vastav main unke sahyogiyon or uttaradhikariyon kii uplabdhiyaan hai
 Pythagoras was born in Samos, a Greek island in the eastern Aegean, on the shores of Asia Minor
 unki maan paaythis or pita manesarchas ke ek phonician vyapaaree) the
 When he was young, he left his place of birth and escaped from the tyrannical government of the Policrates and moved to Croton Celebria in southern Italy
 lamblicus ke anusaar thels unki kshamtaaon se bahut adhik prabhavit tha, usne pithogoras ko egypt main memphis ko chalane or vahaan ke pujaariyon ke saath adhyayan karne kii salaah di jo apni buddhi ke liye jane jate the
 He also served as a disciple in Tires and Bablos in Phenicia
 egypt main unhone kuch jyamitiya siddhanton ko sikhaa jisase prerit hokar unhone antat prameya di jo ab unke naam se jaani jaati he
 This possible inspiration is presented as an extraordinary problem in the Berlin papyrus
 samos se crotone, celebria, italy, aane par unhone ek gupt dharmik samaaj kii sthapana kii jo praarambhik orfic kalt se bahut adhik milti julati thi or sambhawatah usase prabhavit bhi thi
 Pythagoras tried to improve the cultural life of Croton, inspired citizens to follow virtue and established a group of followers around him who were called Pythegoreans
 is saanskrithik kendra ke sanchaalan ke niyam bahut hi sakht the
 He opened his school as a liye for both boys and girls
 Those who took part in the social interiors of Pythagoras called themselves Methmetkoi

 He was known as Akausmetikoi and was allowed to eat meat and keep his personal property
 richard blekmor ne apni pustak di le monastery main pithogorieno ke dharmik prekshanon ko bataaya, "yah itihaas main darj sanyasi jivan kaa pehla udhaaharan tha
 According to Lumblikas, Pythagoras followed a life consisting of religious teaching, simple eating, exercise, reading, and philosophical study
 sangeet is jivan kaa ek aavashyak aayojan kaarak tha: shishy apollo ke liye niyamit rup se mil jul kar bhajan gaate the; ve aatma yaa sharir kii beemaari kaa ilaaj karne ke liye veena kaa upyog karte the; yaaddasht ko badhaane ke liye sone se pehle or baad main kavita pathan kiya jaataa tha
 Flavius jozefus, against Appian, in defense of Judaism, said against Greek philosophy that Pythagoras was familiar with Jewish beliefs, according to Hermippus of Samarna, he included some of them in his philosophy

 This organization was in some ways a school, in some ways a brotherhood and in some ways a monastery
 yah pithogoras ke dharmik upadeshon par aadhaarit tha or bahut hi gupt tha
 First, the school was very much concerned with the morality of society
 sadasyon ko naitikta ke drushtikon ke saath jeena hota tha, ek duusare se pyaar karnaa hota tha, raajnneetik manyataon ko baantna hota tha, shanti kaa anusaran karnaa hota tha or swayan ko prakruti ke ganit ko samarpit kar dena hota tha
 The followers of Pythagoras were commonly called "pathogorians"
 unhen saamanytah darshanik ganitagya kaha jaataa he, jinka aksheeya jyamiti kii shuruyaat par ek prabhaav tha, jo iske vikaas ke 200 saalon ke baad euclid ke dwaara di eliments main likhaa gaya
 Pythagoras observed a law of peace known as Ekmeithia, breaking this rule to be punished with death
 aisa isliye tha kyonki pithogoras kaa maananaa tha ki ek vyakti ke shabd aam taur par laaparvaahee se yukt hote hai, jisase uski galat abhivyakti hoti he or unke anusaar yadi kisi ko is baat par andeh he ki use kya kahana chahie to use hameshaa chup rahanaa chahie
 Another rule of his was that "anyone who should help in a trouble should not let it fall down, because it is a great sin to encourage inaction
" " or ve kehete the ki "apane ghar se nikal jane ke baad vaapis mat jaao, kyoki furis aapke saath honge," yah unhen yaad dilaataa tha ki sab kuch siikhe bina bahut kam seekhney se acha he sristi, bhagwaan or ganit ke bare main, sachai ko siikhnaa 
 In the biographical porphyry of Pythagoras, it is stated that "this peace was not an ordinary peace
 "pithogoriens ek aantarik sarkal methmeticoi or ek bahari sarkal akusameticoi main vibhajit the
 The Porphyry wrote that Methmetkoikois learned the knowledge more extensively, and Akusmatikoi listened to only the summary headings of Pythagoras's writings without any precise exposition
 lamblikaas ke anusaar akusameticoi aamayaham shishy the jo pithogoras ke vyakhyanon ko ek parde ke baahar se sunate the
 The Akausmatikoi were not allowed to see Pythagoras and were not taught the inner secrets of the cult
 iske bajaay unhen gupt tareeke se vyavhaar or naitikta sikhaai jaati thi, gupt arthon se yukt sankshipt baaten bataai jaati thi
 Akusmatikoine Methmetikoiko believed to be genuine Pythagoreans but not the opposite

 His most important work is a book on the philosophical theory of the Golden Mean, at a time when women were considered to be the property of their husbands and only had to take care of their husbands' home, Pythagoras gave women equal status to work
 pithogoras ke samaaj main kai roak thim
 Like do not step on a crossbar and do not eat beans
 ye niyam puraane andhvishwaas the, jaise "ek seedhi ke neeche chalanaa durbhaagya purna hota he
 "even in ancient times, a derogatory title called Mysticos Logos was given to discredit Pythagoras
 faliyon par roak fevism se sambandhit ho sakati he jo bumadhya kshetra ke aas paas vyapak rup se failaa he
 The main point here is akousmata, meaning "rules", so that superstitious prohibitions were primarily applicable to the akousmeticoe and most of the rules came after the death of Pythagoras and were completely free from methmeticoe
 jo taarkik rup se pithogoras kii parampara ke vaastavik sangrakshak hai
 Methmetocycone emphasized more on the inside understanding than the acosmeticoin
 yahan tak ki kuch niyamon or puja paddatiyon ke vistaar par bhi bal diya
 For Methmetikoi to be Pythagorean means an innate quality and presence of inner understanding
 akusamata or -ke saath nipatane kaa ek or tarika bhi tha; unke pratik kathatmak chithran dwaara
 We have some examples of this, one is his explanation of Aristotle: "do not step on a balance", that is, do not be greedy; 'do not strike with a sword on fire ", that is, do not talk in sharp words to an angry person
 , "do not eat the heart" means do not hold yourself in sorrow etc
 hamaare paas paanchavin sadi isa purv tak ke pithogorian sajiv chithran ke saboot hai, iskaa matlab he ki aisi ajeeb baaten paheli ke rup main kahi gayi
 The Pythagoreans are also known for their theory of the transmigration of souls, as well as their theory that number is the true nature of things
 unhone shuddhikaran sanskaron ko apanaaya or jeene ke bhinn niyamon ko viksit kiya, ve aisa maanate the ki ye niyam devataaon ke bich unhen ek ucch pad ko praapt karne ke liye sakasham banaayenge
 Much of their mysticism appears to be keeping the soul integral to the orphic tradition
 orfiks ne kai parishodhak sanskaron ko apanaaya or saath hi anderworld main vibhinn vikaas sanskaron ko apanaaya
 Pythagoras is also closely related to Pherecidus of Ciroce, an ancient commentator who is believed to be the first Greek to teach the transmigration of souls
 pracheen tippaneekar maanate hai ki feresids pithogoras kaa sabase antarang shikshak tha
 Pheresidus taught about the soul in the words of Penta Maycos and-; The most likely origins of the Pythagorean use of the pentagram were their use as a symbol of identity among members and as a symbol of internal health
 pai thogoras sangeet main bahut adhik ruchi lete the, atah unke anuyaayi bhi sangeet main ruchi rakhte the
 Pythagoras was a musician and mathematician
 pithogoras apane samay ke sangeet main sudhaar laana chaahate the, unka maananaa tha ki is sangeet main paryaapt saamanjasy nahin he, yah bahut hi vyast rakhane vaala tha
 According to legend, Pythagoras discovered that the musical note could be translated into mathematical equations, when he one day passed by a working blacksmith and thought that his anvil resulted from an injury The sound being made was beautiful and harmonious and he determined that whatever scientific rule is the reason for it must be mathematical and can be applied to music

) pithogoras ne sankhya ke siddhant ko vistaarpurvak spasht kiya, jiskaa sahi arth aaj bhi vidwaanon ke bich bahes kaa vishay bana hua he
 Pythagoras believed in the "spontaneity of the balls", believing that planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, with some similarities found in musical tones and producing a melodious melody
 saanchaa:academia From the fourth century A
D
, Pythagoras is credited with discovering Pythagoras's theorem, a theorem in geometry that establishes that the square of the diagonal s in a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides b and A
 arthath a2 + b2 = c2
 Although the theorem, now known by his name, was first used by the Babylonians and Indians
 aksar kaha jaataa he ki unhone yaa unke vidhyaarthiyon ne iske pehle pramaan die
 It must be stressed, however, that the manner in which the Babylonians handled the numbers of Pythagoras suggests that they knew that this theory generally proved to be true and that they also knew of some of the evidences which were hitherto unverified Not discovered in sources
 unke skool kii gupt prakruti kii vajah se or iske vidhyaarthiyon ke dwaara sab kuch apane shikshakon ko arpit kar dene kii vajah se, is baat ke koi pramaan nahin hai ki pithogoras ne is prameya ko sabit karne ke liye is par khud kaam kiya
 For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or post-mathematical problems
 kuch log maanate hai ki yah pithogoras kii mrityu ke do sadiyon ke baad plato ke anuyaayiyon ke dwaara saavdhaneepurvak nirmit ek myth he
 Primarily to justify the case of Plato's paraphysics, which worked well with the ideas he devoted to Pythagoras
 yah adhyaropan sadiyon se chalaa aa rahaa he or aadhunik samay se bhi juda hua he
 The earliest reference to Pythagoras's name being associated with this theorem is found in the writings of Cicero and Plutarch five centuries after his death
 aaj pithogoras ko uske anuyaayi greek plato ke saath ahal al tauhid yaa druj vishwaas ke dwaara ek bhakt ke rup main pratishthit kiya jaataa he, lekin pithogoras ke aalochak bhi the, jaise heraclitas jinhone kaha ki "zyada sikh pard lene se buddhi nahin aati he; anyathaa yah hesiod or pithogoras ko or phir se jenophens or hekateyas ko sikhaaya gaya
 Pythagoras had a religious and scientific outlook, in his view science and religion are related to each other
 dharmik rup se pithogoras metempcychosis ke anuyaayi the
 They believed in the relocation or the rebirth of the soul, believing that the soul would incarnate repeatedly in humans, animals, or vegetables until it became virtuous
 unka punarjanm kaa vichaar pracheen unani dharm se prabhavit tha
 He was the first to propose that thought process and soul are located in the brain and not in the heart
 unhen khud vistaar se chaar jivan yaad the jaisaa ki ve daawa karte the ki unhone jie hai or ve apane mrit mitra ke rone kii aawaaj ko ek kute ke bhunkane ke rup main sunate the
 One belief of Pythagoras was that the essence of life is number
 is prakaar se, sabhi chizon kii sthirataa brahmand ko banaati he
 Things like health depend on a constant proportion of the elements; Too little or too much of anything causes an imbalance that can make any organism unhealthy
 ve vichaaron kii tulana sankhya kii gananaaon se karte the
 When philosophy joins folk principles, it becomes a belief that knowledge of the essence of life can be discovered in the form of numbers
 yadi ise ek kadam aage le jaaya jaye kaha ja saktaa he ki kyonki ganit ek andekha saar he, jivan kaa saar ek andekha lakshan he jiskaa ganit ke adhyayan ke dwaara saamana kiya ja saktaa he
 None of the writings of Pythagoras are found, although some forged writings are associated with his name, and these are presently also found; These have been transmitted in antiquity
 jatil pracheen strot jaise arestu or aristogens in lekhanon par andeh prastut karte hai
 The ancient Pythagoreans usually explained their master's phrases with the idiom autos aphe and emphasized the fundamentally oral nature of their teaching
 pithogoras ovid ke metamorfocess kii aakhri kitaab ke charitra ke rup main, jahaan ovid ne uske darshanik drushtikon par vyakhya kii he
 Pythagoras is quoted as saying, "no man is free who cannot control himself
 " Pythagoras also has another side, in which he became a subject of elaborate legends surrounding his historical personality
 arestu ne pithogoras ko ek alokik vyakti ke rup main varnit kiya he jo aashcharya janak kaary karata he, unhen ek golden thai ke rup main aise pahalu ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, jo devatv kii nishaani he
 According to Aristotle and others, some ancient people believed that they had the ability to travel through space and time, and to talk with animals and plants

 pithogoras kii ek mukhya uplabdhi thi ek khoj, ki sangeet 1 se 4 tak sankhyaon ke anupaatik interval par aadhaarit hota he
 He believed that the number system and therefore the cosmos system were based on the sum of these numbers: swearing of Pythagoras by the ten or tetrakatis of the decks rather than the ten deities

 He discovered the principles of mathematical ratios, constructed from 3 to 5 geometric solids
 uske kram ke ek sadsy hippasus ne an anupaatik sankhya kii bhi khoj kii, lekin yah vichaar pithogoras ke liye sochane yogya nahin tha or puranic katha ke anusaar hippasus ko maar daalaa gaya tha
 Pythagoras or also discovered square numbers
 unhone paaya ki udhaaharan ke liye yadi chaar pathar lekar unhen ek varg ke rup main vyavasthit kar diya jaye, to na keval prayek bhujaa duusari bhujaa ke baraabar hoti he, balki yadi do bhujaaon ko ek duusare se guna kiya jaye to, ve varg kii vyavastha main pattharon kii kul sankhya ke yoga ke baraabar hoti hai
 That is why it is called "square root"
 ve ye sochane vaale pehle vyaktiyon main se ek the, ki prithvi gol he or sabhi grahon kaa ek aksh he or sabhi grah ek kendriya bindu ke chaaron or ghoomte hai
 He stated that this central point is the Earth, but later stated that this central point is "agni" which he never identified as the Sun
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki chaand ek anya grah he jise unhone "counter arth "kaha- baad main unhone simit-aseemit main vishwaas jataayaa
 Pythagoras or in a broader sense the Pythagoreans made a significant impact on Plato's work
 aar em hare ke anusaar unke prabhaav main teen bindu shaamil the: a) platonic ganraajya "ek samaan soch vaale logon ke ek sangathit samudaay " ke vichaaron se sambandhit ho saktaa he, jaisaa ki pithogoras ne crotone main sthapit kiya
 B) There is evidence that Plato may have taken the idea from Pythagoras that mathematics and common language, abstract thinking is a safe basis for philosophical thinking, as well as an adequate thesis in science and ethics
 sa) plato or pithogoras ne "aatma or bhautik duniya main iske sthaan ke liye rahasywaadee drushtikon" main saamaan vichaar prastut kiya
 It seems that both were influenced by orphism
 plato ke vichaar spasht rup se arkitas ke kaam se prabhavit hue, jo teesri peedhee kaa ek vaastavik pithogorian tha, usne jyamiti main mahatvapurn yogadan diya, jo euclid ke tatvonki aathvin pustak main pratibimbit hota he
 In the legends of ancient Rome and Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome studied under Pythagoras, it is said
 isaki sambhaavna nahin he kyonki do jeevon ke liye saamaan rup se sweekrut tareekhen adhyaropit nahin karti hai
 Pythagoras established a secret society called the Pythagorean Brotherhood, which was devoted to the study of mathematics
