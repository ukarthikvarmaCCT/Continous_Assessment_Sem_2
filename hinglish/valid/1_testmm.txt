 Hey Rajan! In ancient times there was a king named Muchukunda
 uski indra ke saath mitrataa thi or saath hi yama, kuber, varun or vibhishana bhi uske mitra the
 This king ruled with great devotion, Vishnubhakta and justice
 us raja kii ek kanya thi, jiskaa naam chandrabhaga tha
 The girl was married to Chandrasen's son Shobhan
 ek samay vah shobhan sasuraal aayaa
 Punyadayini Ekadashi was also going to come soon
 jab vrath kaa din sameep aa gaya to chandrabhaga ke man main atyant soch utpann hua ki mere pati atyant durbal hai or mere pita kii ajna ati kathor he
 On Dashami, the king made a proclamation by drumming the whole state and declared that Ekadashi should not be eaten
 dhol kii ghoshnaa sunate hi shobhan ko atyant chintaa hui ou apni patni se kaha ki he priye! ab kya karnaa chahie, main kisi prakaar bhi bhukh sahan nahin kar sakoongaa
 Tell me the way that my life can be saved, otherwise my life will definitely go away
 chandrabhaga kehane lagi ki he swami! mere pita ke raaj main ekadshi ke din koi bhi bhojan nahin karata
 Elephant, horse, camel, cat, cow etc
 cannot also accept food, grain, water, etc
, then what does a human being say
 yadi aap bhojan karnaa chaahate hai to kisi duusare sthaan par chale jaaie, kyonki yadi aap yaheen rahanaa chaahate hai to aapako avashya vrath karnaa padegaa
 Hearing this, Shobhan started saying, "hey dear!" i will definitely fast, anyone who is in luck will be seen
 is prakaar se vichaar kar shobhan ne vrath rakh liya or vah bhukh va pyaas se atyant peedit hone laga
 When Surya Narayana got set and the time of awakening came at night which was very pleasing to the Vaishnavas, but extremely painful for Shobhan
 praat:kaal hote shobhan ke praan nikal gaye
 Then the king cremated him with perfumed wood
 parantu chandrabhaga ne apane pita kii ajna se apane sharir ko dagdh nahin kiya or shobhan kii antyeshti kriya ke baad apane pita ke ghar main hi rahane lagi
 Under the influence of Rama Ekadashi, Shobhan received a beautiful Devpur on the Mount Mandarachal, rich in wealth and devoid of enemies
 vah atyant sundar ratna or vaiduryamani jatit swarna ke khambhon par nirmit anek prakaar kii sphatik maniyon se sushobhit bhawan main bahumoolya vastrabhupanon tathaa chhatra va chanwar se vibhooshit, gandharva or apsariyon se yukt singhaasana par arudh aisa shobhyman hota tha maano doosraa indra virajman ho
 Once a Brahmin named Som Sharma, who lived in Muchukund Nagar, went wandering around while doing pilgrimage and he recognized Shobhan and said that it is the king's Jamai Shobhan
 shobhan bhi use pahchaan kar apane asana se uthakar uske paas aayaa or pranamadi karke kushal prashn kiya
 The Brahmin said that King Muchukund and your wife are from Kushal
 nagar main bhi sab prakaar se kushal hai, parantu he rajan! hamen aashcharya ho rahaa he
 Tell your account that such a beautiful city that has never been seen or heard, how did you get it
 tab shobhan bolaa ki karthik krishna kii rama ekadshi kaa vrath karne se mujhe yah nagar praapt hua, parantu yah asthir he
 Take such a remedy if it becomes stable
 brahman kehane laga ki he rajan! yah sthir kyon nahin he or kaise sthir ho saktaa he aap bataaie, phir main avashyamev vah upaay karunga
 Do not misunderstand this matter of mine
 shobhan ne kaha ki maine is vrath ko shraddharahit hokar kiya he
 Hence, everything is unstable
 yadi aap muchukund kii kanya chandrabhaga ko yah sab vrittant kahen to yah sthir ho saktaa he
 Hearing this, that superior Brahmin returned to his city and narrated all the accounts from Chandrabhaga
 brahman ke vachan sunakar chandrabhaga badi prasannataa se brahman se kehane lagi ki he brahman! ye sab baaten aapane pratyaksh dekhi hai yaa swapn kii baaten kar rahe hai
 The Brahmin started saying that, o daughter! i have seen your husband directly in Mahavan
 saath hi kisi se vijay na ho aisa devataaon ke nagar ke samaan unka nagar bhi dekha he
 He also said that it is not stable
 jis prakaar vah sthir rah sake so upaay karnaa chahie
 Chandrabhaga started saying Vipra! You take me there, i have a longing to see husband
 main apane kiye hue punya se us nagar ko sthir bana duungi
 You should do such a thing which is our coincidence because mixing dissociation is a great virtue
 som sharma yah baat sunakar chandrabhaga ko lekar mandarachal parvat ke sameep vamdev rishi ke ashram par gaya
 Vamdevji heard the whole thing and anointed Chandrabhaga with the pronunciation of Veda mantras
 tab rishi ke mantra ke prabhaav or ekadshi ke vrath se chandrabhaga kaa sharir divya ho gaya or vah divya gati ko praapt hui
 After this she went to her husband with great pleasure
 apni priy patni ko aate dekhakar shobhan ati prasann hua
 And called him and sat on his left side
 chandrabhaga kehane lagi ki he prannath! aap mere punya ko grahan kiijie
 Ever since i was eight years old at my father's house, i have been paying homage to Ekadashi fast
 is punya ke pratap se aapkaa yah nagar sthir ho jayega tathaa samast karmon se yukt hokar pralay ke ant tak rahegaa
 Thus Chandrabhaga started living happily with her husband, equipped with divine clothes and robes
 he rajan! yah maine rama ekadshi kaa mahatmaya kaha he, jo manushya is vrath ko karte hai, unke brahmahatyadi samast paap nasht ho jate hai

 shabdon kii teen shaktiyaan hoti hai : abhidha, lakshana tathaa vyanjana
 Abhidha: When a word is used in the normal sense, then there is its Abhidha Shakti, such as 'to offer on the head' means to lift something from a place and place it on the head
 lakshana : jab shabd kaa saamaanya arth main prayog na karte hue kisi vishesh prayojan ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, yah jis shakti ke dwaara hota he use lakshana kehete hai
 To 'climb on the head' from the symptom would mean reverence

 Vyanjana: When Abhidha and Lakshana finish their work, then the power through which any meaning of word-groups or sentences is communicated is called 'vyanjana'

 The game of gambling in India is known as Akkashrida or Akshudyut
 veda ke samay se lekar aaj tak yah bharatiyon kaa atyant lokapriy khel rahaa he
 In a famous Sukta of the Rigveda, the Kittav draws an interesting picture of his plight that he does not ask him even to his best due to losing in gambling, what about others? He himself teaches - Aksharma Divya: Krishimitta Krishnasva
 mahabharat jaisaa pralayankari yuddh bhi akshakreeda ke parinamswaroop hi hua
 The followings of Panini's Ashtadhyayi and Kashika give a complete introduction to the nature of Akkashrida
 panini use aakshik kehete hai
 
 patanjali ne siddhhast dyutkar ke liye akshakitav yaa akshadhoort shabdon kaa prayog kiya he
 In Vedic period, there is no definite introduction to the content of gaming, but in Panini's time this game was played with Aksha and Shalaka
 kautilya ke arthshaastra kaa kathan he ki dyutadhyaksh kaa yah kaam he ki vah juadiyon ko rajya kii ore se khilne ke liye aksh or shalaka diya kare 
 In some ancient times, the axis was meant to be the seed of a bheda
 parantu panini kaal main aksh chaukani goti or shalaka ytaakar goti hoti thi
 The number of these pieces was five, which can be easily estimated from Taittiriya Brahmin and Ashtadhyayi
 brahmanon ke granthon main inke naam bhi paanch the- akshraj, krit, treta, dwapar tathaa kali
 Kashika calls this game as Panchika gaming for this reason
 panini ke akshashlaka sankhyah parina sutara main un dashaon kaa ullekh he jinamein goti phenkane vaale kii haar hoti thi or is sthiti kii soochna ke liye akshapari, shalakapari, ekapari, dwipari, tripari tathaa chatushpari padon kaa prayog sanskrit main kiya jaataa tha
 It is clear in the description of Kashika that if all the above five pieces fell in mind or the platen fell, then in both cases, the thrower would win
 arthath yadi ek goti anya gotiyon kii avasthaa se bhinn hokar chitt yaa patt pade, to haar hoti thi or iske liye ekapari shabd prayukt hote the
 In the same way, the defeat of two pieces was called the triparti from three to three and the defeat of four was called Chaturpari
 jeetne kaa daanv krit or haarane kaa daanv kali kehalaata tha
 This opposition to Krita and Kali is also indicated in Buddhist texts
 jue main baaji bhi lagaai jaati he or is dravya ke liye panini ne glah shabd kii siddhi maani he 
 Shakuni, the famous gambler of Mahabharata, is right to say that gambling is so infamous among people because of the betting
 mahabharat, arthshaastra aadi granthon se pataa chalata he ki jua sabha main khelaa jaataa tha
 The Smriti texts give a complete introduction to the rules of gambling
 arthshaastra ke anusaar juadi ko apane khel ke liye rajya ko dravya dena padataa tha
 The state received five per cent of the money appropriated as tax
 pancham shatee main ujjayini main iske vipul prachaar kii soochna mrichctic naatak se hamen uplabdh hoti he
