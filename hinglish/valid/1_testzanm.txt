 cricket ke khel main pagabaadha ) ballebaaj ko out karne kii ek vidhi he
 An umpire declares a batsman to be LBW out under a series of circumstances, when the ball that can hit the batsman's wicket primarily hits the batsman's body
 elbeadblyoo niyam ko isliye banaaya gaya tha taaki gend ko wicket se na takaraane dene ke liye ballebaaj apane balle ke sthaan par sharir kaa istemaal na kare
 LBW is commonly known as the most complex rule of the game
 leg bifor wicket shabd main leg kaa prayog hone ke baavjood, yah niyam tab bhi lagu hota he jab balla thaamne vaale haath ke dastaane ko chhod kar gend ballebaaj ke sharir ke kisi anya hisse se takaraae
 The rule of LBW was not included in the rules of cricket until 1744
 sarvapratham is niyam kaa prayog 1774 main hua, jiske anusaar: ballebaaj ko out mana jayega yadi xxrep 5 
 yaa phir ballebaaj gend ko rokane ke liye apni taang wicket ke saamne adaae or gend ko wicket se takaraane se roak de
 While the use of the LBW rule was most definitely caused by the batsman deliberately snapping legs and feet in order not to hit the ball with the wicket, early writers such as John Nairn were known for this deliberate work by Tom Taylor and Joey Ring is considered responsible
 haalanki, unka kareer 1774 ke baad shuru hua or, jaisaa ki arthur hegarth bataate hai, " in paraspar virdohi bayanon main ab saamanjasy sthapit karnaa asambhav he"
 For this reason the rule of LBW was not recorded for many years
 agast 1795 main maulsi hurst main hue sarre banaam england ekadash ke match main jon tafton ko jon wales dwaara elbeadblyoo niyam ke tahat out kiya gaya tha
 According to Hegarth: In this match, for the first time it was found that "pagbadha" has been recorded
 In Brisher's printed score-book, in this match Mr
 J
 Tftan is simply described as bold, and the note is written lamb
 shuruyaat main, jab koi bhi ballebaaj is tareeke se out hota tha, to keval aisa likhaa jaataa tha ki vah bold hua he or pagabaadha nahin likhaa jaataa tha
 In essence, the essence of this rule is: yadi gend ballebaaj se takaraati he jo ki wicket se takaraane vaali thi, to use elbeadblyoo qaraar diya jaataa he, jab tak ki: Note: Balls falling off the leg side mean that fifty percent or more of the ball must be outside the leg stump
 iske alaava, of stump se baahar ballebaaj se takaraane vaali gend kaapchaas pratishat yaa isse adhik hissaa of stump kii line ke baahar ballebaaj se takaraana chahie
 Despite its complications, the catch (after catch and bold) is the most common type of dismissal in cricket
 ek ballebaaj ko elbeadblyoo out qaraar dene kii sharten nimna hai: There are three rules to explain these situations: The exception to this involves the umpire's decision whether the batsman has attempted to hit the ball or not
 is niyam ko isliye banaaya gaya he taaki ballebaaj of stump se baahar gend ko sirf pad par na khele, jisase balle se gend takaraa kar kaich dene kii sambhaavna samaapt ho jaati he
 a common defensive strategy against spin bowlers is to use pads to avoid the ball at the off stump, but the LBW rule means that their bat is close to the pad, allowing fielders standing in the slip to catch a catch, or their LBW likely to be out
 richi banode jaise kuch samikshakon ne sujhaayaa he ki elbeadblyoo niyam ko kuch is prakaar badalanaa chahie ki leg stump se thodi baahar tappa padane par bhi ballebaaj ko out qaraar diya ja sake, jisase legspinron ko madad milegi or nakaaratmak pad-play se bachaa ja sakegaa
 The LBW rule is always reviewed by the umpire standing at the bowler's end
 agar kshetrarakshan karne vaali team kaa maananaa he ki ek ballebaaj elbeadblyoo out ho saktaa he, to unhen nirnay ke liye ampire se anurodh karnaa chahie
 All lbw conditions must be evaluated for the ball, which takes half a second to reach the batsman
 niyamon ke anya pahaluon ke rup main, ballebaaj ko hameshaa kisi bhi andeh kaa laabh diya jaataa he, isliye, yadi ampire santusht nahin he, to anurodh ko thukraa diya jayega
udhaaharan ke rup main yadi gend ke ballebaaj se takaraane se pehle ballebaaj ek kadam aage bad jaataa he
 The ball may have hit the wicket in the future, but it is very difficult for an umpire to be sure that the ball will be 1
5–2 meters from the wicket when the batsman hits the leg
 televijan riple ke madhyam se ab yah bataanaa saral ho gaya he ki elbeadblyoo kii sabhi sharton ko puraa kiya gaya tha yaa nahin or isliye kuch log shikaayat karte hai ki ek ampire ne ballebaaj ko galat tareeke se khel jari rakhane ke liye kaha yaa use galat tareeke se out qaraar de diya
 However, before an umpire gives a batsman out, one must be sure that he is out or not and since they do not have any facilities like TV replays, the decision of the umpire is usually justified
 adhikansh khiladi or camentator is nirnay ko sweekaar karte hai or ampiron kii aalochana bahut kam hoti he
 LBW is arguably the most difficult of the umpires to decide and may cause comment and controversy among viewers
 haal ke varshon main, cricket main badhate dabaav or daanv par lage paison ke kaaran kai log anishchit maamalon main camaron kii bhoomika ko badhaane or hoque-ai jaisi simulation takanic ke prayog par jor de rahe hai
 At the moment, LBW is a decision that is only taken by the umpire standing on the field
 tathaapi badlaav kii hawa chal padi he: sitambar 2005 main, antarrashtriya cricket parishad ne ampiron dwaara televijan riple ke madhyam se nirnay lene main sahaayta karne ke liye ek pareekshan ko adhikrut kiya
 
 yah dhyaan dene yogya he ki yadi gend pehle pad se takaraati he or phir balle se takaraati he, to ballebaaj ko elbeadblyoo out ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he lekin yadi ballebaaj gend ko balle se martha he tathaa iske baad gend uske pad se takaraati he, to ballebaaj ko us maamle main out ghoshit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 However, in both cases, there is a risk of a batsman being caught out as the ball may bounce relatively slowly and be caught by a fielder
 yadi gend bina tappa khaae ballebaaj se takaraae, to us sthiti main gend ke tappa padane ke baad ke kisi bhi sambhavit vichlan ko andekha karte hue ampaire ko gend kii gati evam oochaal dwaara isaki disha kaa anumaan lagaana padataa he
 However, the umpire may take into account the swing or flow of the ball before determining whether the ball will hit the wicket
 agar gend swing kar rahi he to ampaire ko yah anumaan lagane kii anumati he ki gend usee disha main swing hogi athwa nahin
 There is a misconception that the batsman cannot get out lbw when the ball hits the leg stump
 aamtaur par aisa mana jaataa he ki leg stump ke baahar tappa khaane vaali gend kaa parinaam note out hoga, tathaapi elbeadblyoo kanoon ke kii sateek paribhaasha or no ball kii vartmaan paribhaasha ke anusaar, ek asaamaanya paristhiti main iskaa apwaad bhi he
 24
6 Under the rule, a ball will be considered a valid ball only if it bounces twice
 The 36
1 rule states that if the ball "hits the ball in a straight line between the wicket to wicket or the batsman's off-side wicket if it does not stop before it collapses", then the batsman is out lbw
 " yahaan dhyaan dene yogya he ki, niyam 36
1 main leg said kaa koi ullekh nahin he, na hi isamen kaha gaya he ki aisi sthiti ek se adhik baar ho
 is prakaar ek gend jo ki do baar uchhalati he, kaa parinaam elbeadblyoo ho saktaa he bhale hi usame ek tappa leg stump kii line se baahar ho
 antarrashtriya cricket main aaj tak koi bhi ballebaaj is dhang se out nahin hua he
 LBW is a term used on 21 November 1934 to describe a change in footpath rule made by the Marilybon Cricket Club
 1935 main yah england main astitv main aayaa tha, lekin australia main ucch str ke adhikariyon dwaara iskaa virodh kiya gaya jahaan yah 1936 / 1937 satr tak lagu nahin ho sakaa tha, haalanki australia main 1935 / 1936 ke satr ke dauraan club maichon main ise lagu karne kii koshish kii gai thi
 According to this change, LBW out can be declared even if it falls outside the off stump if the batsman prevents it from any part of his body in the straight line between wicket to wicket
 isse pehle, sirf gendbaaj ke chor tathaa ballebaaj kii viketon ke bich kii sidhi rekha main padane vaali gendon dwaara hi elbeadblyoo out kiya ja saktaa tha
 The term "LBW" refers to the fact that in the scorecards published by Wisden from 1935 to 1937, the wickets taken by the new turban rule were different from the wickets of the earlier rules of 1935
 1920 evam 1930 ke dashak ke dauraan pratham shrenee cricket kii visheshta ballebaajon dwaara gendbaajon par badhata prabhutv tha
 With a world record of 1107 runs by Victoria against New South Wales on MCG in 1926 / 1927, Australia had an exceptionally high run rate during the 1920s
 1928 main, county cricket main ek wicket lene kii ausat keemat 30 ran thi jo 1901 kii apni pichhali ucch keemat 27
5 ko paar kar gai thi
 Attempts to block the number of runs allowed by the LBW decision, regardless of whether the batsman played the ball, were partially successful in 1929, but during the 1930s test matches showed extremely high runs and many draw matches
 That it was only a transient effect and by 1934 this experiment was abolished
 adhikariyon ke saamne yah spasht tha ki harbart satakliff or phil mid jaise acha pad play khilne vaale ballebaaj ucch ransankhya tathaa dra maichon kii babbti sankhya ke liye jimmedaar the
 Therefore, the purpose of protecting the balls falling out of the off stump was not only to combat pad play but also to discourage fast "bodyline" bowling by rewarding bowlers who bowl the off stump and hence the off side
 Was encouraged to play attractive strokes
 1934 main isaki atyadhik vivechna hui or yah aam taur par sahmati bani ki of said par elbeadblyoo niyam kaa ek vistaar rakshaatmak pad play ko kam kar saktaa he
 Some people, like Harold Larwood, demanded LBW on any ball that was off the stump, even if the batsman's feet were out of the stump - something that had been considered since the 1970s

 The inclination of diplomatic history is mostly towards the history of diplomacy whereas international relations pay more attention to contemporary events
 rajnay ek kala he jise apana kar duniya ke rajya apane parsparik sambandhon ko badhaate hue apni hit sadhana karte hai
 After the well-defined goals of diplomacy and the efficient instruments set up for their achievement, the achievement of its desirable results depends on the means and methods that a state decides to adopt
 duusare rajya in sadhano ke aadhaar par hi rajnay ke vaastavik lakshyon kaa anumaan lagaate hai
 If there is inconsistency between the means and goals of diplomacy, then this weaken the country, discredit it and its international reputation falls
 is drushtir se prayek rajya ko aise saadhan apnaane chaiye jo duusare rajyon main uske prati sadbhaavna or vishwaas paidaa kar saken
 For this, it is necessary that the state should explain its policies clearly, recognize the just claims of other states and behave honestly
 beyimaani tathaa chalbaaji se kaam karne vaale rajanyajna alpakaaleen lakshyon main safalataa paa lete hai kintu kul milakar ve nuksaan main hi rahete hai
 In other states, there is distrust towards them and they become aware
 atah rajnay ke tareekon kaa mahatv he
 While deciding the means of diplomacy, it should be kept in mind that its main objective is to protect the principal interests of the state
 thik yahi uddeshy anya rajyon ke rajnay kaa bhi he
 Therefore, every diplomat should adopt a policy of mutual exchange
 prayek rajya ke rajanyagnon kii kam se kam tyaag dwaara adhik se adhik praapt karne kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he
 For this, agreement between the opposing interests is necessary
 samjhaute tathaa saudebaaji kaa yah niyam he ki kuch bhi praapt karne ke liye kuch na kuch dena padataa he
 This exchange is a practical truth of diplomacy
 itihaas main aise bhi udhaaharan milte hai jabaki ek shaktishaalee bade rajya ne duusare kamjor rajya ko apni manamaani sharten maanane ke liye baadhya kiya tathaa samjhautapurna aadan-pradaan kii prakriya na apana kar ek paksheeya baadhyataa kaa maarg apanaaya
 Thus the conditions imposed by the concerned state are carried out only until it is compelled to do so and is relieved of their weight as soon as they get the opportunity

 yahan ham yunaan, rome, italy, france tathaa bharat main apanaae rajanyik aachaar ke tareekon kaa adhyayan karenge
 The history of diplomacy begins with the Greek city states
 plato tathaa arastu jaise raajnneetik darshanikon ne nagar rajyon kii raajnneetik sthiti evam anya rajyon se unke sambandhon ke bare main paryaapt likhaa he
 In the early phase of Greek civilization, the ambassadors of the city states were called precursors
 inkaa kaary keval sandhi vaarta karne tak hi simit nahin tha varan ye rajkeey gruhasthi ke sanchaalan, sabhaaon evam parishadon main vyavastha kii sthapana tathaa dharmik anushthanon ke sampaadan aadi kaa kaary bhi karte the
 With the development of Greek civilization, the relations of the city states became complex and competitive
 ab sandhi vaarta ke liye aise logon kii aavashyaktaa padi jo ojasvi tathaa prabhaavshaalee vaktaa hon, jinaki teevr samaran shakti evam buland aawaaj ho taaki ve duusare nagar rajyon kii lok sabhaaon ke sammukh apane nagar kaa drushtirakone prastut kar sake or uske paksh main joardaar pushtir kar sake
 On diplomatic posts, such a person was appointed who is a skilled speaker, a student of political relations and a psychologist
 prasiddh itihaaskaar thucydids ke vivaranon ko padhane se gyaat hota he ki us samay ke rajanyagnon kii vaktrutaayen paryaapt ojasvi tathaa sudeergh hua karti thi
 It has given details of a Lok Sabha of Sparta residents in which allies and friends were invited to decide whether the state of Athens had violated its treaties and if it did, would it be declared a war against it Should it be done? After the expiry of the statements in this assembly, the resolution of war was passed first on the basis of voice and then on the basis of counting
 ullekhneey baat yah thi ki isi samay sparta main athensvasi pratinidhi-mandal kisi vyapaarik sandhi ke sandarbh main aayaa hua tha or ukt sabha main nimantrit na hote hue bhi upasthit tha
 It was allowed to express its opinion in between
 jab yuddh vishyak prastaav paarit ho gaya to is pratinidhi mandal ke sadsy shatru rajya ke naagarik ban gayi, phir bhi inako us samay tak sparta main rahane diya gaya jab tak ki unhone apana sandhi-vishyak kaary puraa nahin kar liya
 The Greek diplomat used to perform these tasks - collecting related information in the welcoming state, adopting all methods in support of the interests of his state in front of the popular city assemblies, preparing occasional reports regarding the foreign state, of the citizens of his state in the foreign state Protecting interests etc
 us samay thucydids dwaara rajanyajna ke rup main sampann kiye gayi kaary hamaare adhyayan ke liye paryaapt upyogi hai
 He adopted negotiation and convention diplomacy to resolve disputes peacefully

 Here, residents are classified into three parts - slaves, foreign residents and citizens of Athens in terms of trade and seaside connectivity

 The diplomacy here was influenced by trade, commerce and security requirements
 yunaan ke in nagar rajyon dwaara rajanyagnon ko anek unmuktiyaan evam visheshadhikaar saunpe jate the
 From the very beginning, the contribution of these diplomats in the creation of foreign relations was not only important but also extensive
 unani nagar rajyon ke aapasi sambandhon ne anek reeti rivaajon evam siddhanton ko janm diya
 At that time international law was in its infancy
 athens sparta evam thebs aadi nagaar rajyon ne aapasi sambandhon kaa vikaas apni aantarik niti, suvidha or suraksha sambandhi ranneeti ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya
 Modern religious treaties can be seen in the religious and political associations of the time

 Reports sent by self-styled ambassadors from abroad were widely considered in popular meetings of city states
 unke sujhaavo dwaara prastut samasyaon par vichaar karke aavashyak nirdesh diye jate the
 In the event of a dispute between the states, the tradition of its resolution by the Panch judgment had taken place
 anterrashtriya jivan ko niyamit karne kii drushtir se unaniyon dwaara viksit do prakriyaayen ullekhneey hai - The diplomatic behavior of Greek city states can be described briefly as follows- unani kaal ke rajnay kii aalochana karte hue kabhi-kabhi yah kaha jaataa he ki unani log anterrashtriya naitikta kii dharna se aparichit the jiske bina shreshth rajanyik yantra bhi nishkiray siddh hota he, ausatan unani kii nagar rajya ke prati swamibhakti itani gahari hoti thi ki vah anya nagar rajya vaasiyon ko apana sambhavit shatru or shesh asabhyon ko swaabhaavik das maanata tha
 Despite various notable notions of diplomatic relations, the diplomatic ethos of the Greeks was flawed in many respects - sankshep main, unaniyon ne rajanyik aachaar ke kshetra main kaaphi unnati kar lee thi
 The Romans were more barbaric than the Greeks
 atah ve intaraashtriya sambandhon kaa vikaas nahin kar sake
 The Greeks had developed the treaty negotiation system and expressed confidence in contacting opponents through the diplomatic process, but the Romans believed in military power more
 ve rajanyajna kii bajaay vijeta adhik the
 The Romanians relied more on direct action than on diplomatic methods
 unhone apni sarvocchata banaaye rakhane ke liye yah tarika apanaaya ki do yaa adhik rashtron ke bich sangharsh ke samay ve kamjor kaa paksh lete, kyanki unka vishwaas tha ki is niti se donon hi paksh rome ke raajnneetik anugrah ke aankakshi bane rahenge
 By taking the side of the weak, he will not only accept the influence of Rome, but when the powerful is overthrown by taking the side of the weak, then that powerful side will also be forced to consider the influence of Rome
 roman logon ne rajnay ke kshetra main yuddh kii vaidhaniktaa ke siddhanth kaa pratipaadan kiya jiske anusaar unki drushtir main vahi yuddh vaidhanik hota tha jisaki aupchaarik ghoshnaa kii gai ho or jiske liye ek vishesh dharm-guru dwaara dharmik samaaroh kaa aayojan kara liya gaya ho
 The Romans continued to welcome foreign politicians in both war and peace
 ve rajdoot ko saamanyatya lagetus kehete the or kabhi-kabhi fetial bhi kah dete the
 This word was often used with the interlocutor for war or peace
 roman seenet niyamit rup se videshon main apane desh ke rajdoot bhejti thi
 Roman law recognized ambassadors as trespassing
 vikhyath raajnneetik vichaarak siciro ne, jo rome main doot ban kar aayaa tha, is sambandh main likhaa he, “rajdooton kii anatikramyata divine tathaa maanviya donon hi kanoonon se he
 They are pious and austere so that they remain inflexible
 ye keval mitra rashtran main hi nahin he apitu shatru kii sena main dhire hone par bhi hai” roman kanoon ke antargat rajdoot ke sahyogi bhi anatikramya the
 The correspondence of the ambassadors and the items necessary for them were considered obsolete
 rajdoot jab kisi tisare rajya main se gujarata to bhi use anatikramya kaa visheshadhikaar praapt tha
 Any attack on the ambassador was considered a violation of Roman interstate law
 rajdoot par kshetreey-brahyata kaa siddhanth bhi lagu hota tha arthath koi samjhauta tode jane par rajdoot rajya ke nyaayalay main mukadmaa nahin chalaaya jaataa tha, vah sthaneey kanoonon se unmukt tha
 The Roman Senate used to treat ambassadors as state guests
 roman logon ne rajnay ke kshetra main ek prashikshit ‘puralekhpal’ kii paddati pradaan kii
 The archivists were proficient in diplomatic parables and procedures
 aaj bhi rajnay kii ek mahatvapurn shakha puraane lekhon, sindhyon, abhilekhon aadi kii raksha karnaa or unhen vyavasthit rakhana he
 The Roman people referred to work related to archives or articles as 'diplomatic practice'
 is prakaar ke lekhon ko vyavasthit rakhane kii paddati roman logon kii ek mahatvapurn dein he
 The Romans never respected the principle of equality of states
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki romanav logon ko apni sarvshereshthata main vishwaas tha, ve anya kisi rajya ko apane samakaksh nahin samajhate the
 This is the reason that in the Roman period, there was no development in the field of establishing diplomatic relations on the basis of equality and negotiation
 roman logon ne ek vishaal samrajya kii sthapana to kii lekin rajanyik bhaichaare ke aadhaar par anterrashtriya sambandhon ko viksit nahin kiya
 The Romans were almost unaffected by the basic elements of Greek civilization
 da0 shukradev prasad dube ne rajnay ke itihaas main apane adhyayan main pracheen roman rajanyik aachaar par prakaash daalate hue kaha he ki “roman vijayon ne jis vishwa rajya kaa nirmaan kiya, usamen parrthian, hindu or chini sabhyataaain hi aisi thi jo uski seemaa paridhi ke baahar thi
 Therefore, Rome did not require any special diplomatic legislation in this political environment
 uskaa kaam keval apni rajya seemaa ko barbar akramanon se surakshit rakhana tha, phir bhi roman samrajya ke vaideshik maamle kaaphi dilachasp the
 From the ancient times, whatever diplomatic dialogue was necessary on the circumstances of Rome's war and peace was entrusted to a specific diplomatic institution, namely the College of Fatalities
 roman dharna ke anusaar sabhi yuddh uchit the
 Before the war, the head of the Photialus College, called Patrus, informed the Senate that all diplomatic negotiations to find a peaceful solution proved fruitless
 yuddh prarambh karne ke nirnay ke uparant vah ek khooni bhaalaa shutra ke sthal par phankta tha
 This ritual was performed by taking an oath along with the call of Jupiter etc
 gods
 jab rome ke vistaar ke saath hi fitrelas kaa pratinidhitiv rajdoot karne lage to bhaalaa fankne kii aupchaarik pranali ne ek pratikaatmak swaroop le liya or shatru ke sthal ke sthaan par apana meetirs praan athwa beluna ke mandir k saamne phanka jane laga
 Fittilus was also given the task of establishing a treaty
 videshi rajdooton ko seenet se farvari ke maheene main capital ke nikat grecastirpesus ke avasar par pratyaksh vaarta karne kaa bhi avasar miltaa tha
 With the coming of the imperialist era, the emperor himself took up this task in his own hands
 rome dwaara kii gai sabhi sandhiyaan asmaan thi kyonki ve vijit pradeshon ke shaskaon par sadaiv ke liye thope di jaati thi
 The Jasentium of Rome, ie the legislation under which the legal principles were developed to cater to the foreign needs of Roman citizens, was not an international law in the true sense, although it also guided the relations which the Roman empire had with its neighbors
 Used to install from greek samskruti ke prati purna sammaan or nishtha rakhte hue bhi roman sagrajyavaadiyon ne greek-anterrashtriya samhita kaa anukaran nahin kiya
 The reason for this was obvious
 jahaan greek anterrashtriya vidhaan us samskruti ke swatantra rajyon ke parsparik sambandhon se utpann aavashyaktaa kii dein thi, vahaan roman sagrajya duusare deshon ke prati ek vistaaravaadi drushtirakone apana chukaa tha or shighratisheeghra vijit kar unka vilay apane samrajya main karnaa chahta tha arthath unka vishwa samrajya greek rajya vyavastha ke vighatan par hi sambhav tha
 The Roman Empire was a compilation of many castes and nationalities and where the central authority did not think it appropriate to give local nationalities any right to establish anything
 atah greek rajyon kii anterrashtriya pranali roman kootnithik paristhitiyon ke sarvatha pratikul thi
 The Roman Empire collapsed in 395 AD
 rome samrajya jiskaa kendra rome tha, chhin-bhinn ho gaya tab romanon ne kustuntuniya ko kendra maanakar vigentin samrajya kii sthapana kii
 Rude and wild castes resided around this empire
 apane samrajya kii raksha ke liye roman sainik shakti ke sthaan par yukti-shakti par vishwaas karne lage
 To keep those rude under control, he adopted three methods - jo jatiyaan isaai dharm ko na maanati thi, unamem isaai dharm kaa prachaar kar unhen isaai bananaa tha jisase ve gaiyr-isaai jatiyon se milakar samrajya par akraman na karen bigentin samraaton ne kabhi apane virodhiyon ko sangathit na hone diya
 He arranged for ambassadors for the success of his policy
 inkaa kaam tha swagatakarta rajya main vahaan kii aantarik paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan, mahatvakankshiyon evam durbalataaon kii jaankaree va unki suchnaayen samraat ko pahunchaana
 Thus the diplomatic ethos was changed
 ab rajdoot kaa kaary videsh main bhaashan dena hi na rahaa balki vah vahaan kii aantarik, aarthik evam saamaajik vyavastha kaa adhyayan karen or padosi rajyon kii durbalataaon se apane samraat ko prativedan dwaara avgat karaate rahen jisase samraat apni kaary-siddhi ko sahi rup main nirdhaarit kar sake
 While appointing the ambassadors, three qualities were taken special care of them - nickelson ke anusaar, “kushal vaktaa ke sthaan par rajdoot udghoshak tathaa prashikshit nireekshak rakhe gayi
 The number of ambassadors increased significantly

 In the context of human resources, the substitution of an employee by another employee is called laborious or labor substitution
 kisi sanghathan se koi karmchaaree kai kaarnon se alag ho saktaa he- nishkasana, sevanivritti, mrityu, sthaanantaran, tyaagptr aadi
 The turnover rate of an organization is expressed as a percentage of the total number of employees leaving the organization at a given time, ie shramavart kii vruddhi ke anek kaaran hai
 Death and retirement are the two natural factors that cause the labor to be separated from his work
 saath hi yah sthaan sheeghra hi bhar liye jate hai taaki utpaadan prakriya main baadha na pade
 Voluntary withdrawal from work by workers is another important factor that increases labor turnover
 yah do roopon main vyakt hota he, pehla tyaag patr ke rup main tathaa doosraa, kaary parityag ke rup main
 In the first place, the worker expresses his desire to resign from the work and duly informs the manager to express his intention to leave the work while in the second form he leaves the work without being told
 tyaagptr ke liye anek kaaran uttaradaayi ho sakate hai
 For example - getting a better job, not accepting the conditions of the institute, being insulted under the institute, being inappropriate of the institute, getting involved in family matters, etc
 teesraa mahatvapurn kaarak nishkasana he
 Several factors may also be responsible for the removal
 udaahranarth, anushaasanheenata kaa pradarshan, kaary kaa gunatmak or parimanatmak drushtikon se uchit rup main na kiya janaa, santhaan ke viruddh baghawat, kaary ke samay bina avkaash liye anupasthit rahanaa ityadi
 We can divide the results of labor in three parts
 shramavart ke parinaamon ko ham teen bhaagon main vibhajit kar sakate hai
 Direct Results: Those are the results which include the expenses incurred for training of newly recruited workers, as well as small expenses incurred in the life of the recruited person
 punarsthaapan main hone vaala atirikt vyay : iske antargat atirikt vyay naye bhartee kiye gayi shramikon kii kushalta kii kami ke kaaran hota he jo ki utpaadan kaa gunatmak evam parimanatmak donon roopon main prabhavit karata he
 Additional expenses incurred before hiring new workers: This loss occurs because there is also time to recruit new workers in place of old workers
 us samyaantar main utpaadan gir jaataa he jisase ki santhaan ko kshati pahunchati he
 High rates of labor cannot be helpful in inducing stability and devotion and credibility in industrial relations and employees
 shramavart k dushprinaamon ko tabhi roka ja saktaa he jabaki isse sambandhit aankadon kaa vishwasaneeyata ke saath satat ekatrit kiya jaay or unke vishleshan main un karka ko dhundha jaay jo ki badalati hui paristhitiyon main shramavart kii ucch daron ke liye uttaradaayi rahe hai
 The exit interview has emerged as an effective tool to reduce labor rates in industrially progressive Western countries
 iske antargat carmik vibhaag dwaara ek toli kii niyukti kii jaati he jo is baat ke liye satat karyrat rahati he ki shramikon ke santhaan se algaav kaa kya kaaran he, yah aichhik he yaa anaichhik
 Whenever a resignation letter is received, the laborer who resigned is interviewed and is given complete freedom to express his feelings without fear and hesitation
 yadi shramik kaary ko bina soochna ke hi chhod jaataa he to is baat kaa satat prayaas kiya jaataa he ki usase vahiin sambandh sthapit kiya jaye jahaan vah mil sake or un tathyon ko prakaash main laane kii koshish kii jaati he jinke kaaran shramik kaary ko chhodkar chalaa gaya tha
 If the matter is of retrenchment or dismissal, then a full examination is made as to whether the action taken is done under the provisions of labor laws and permanent ordinances
 is prakaar ke bahirgaman saakshaatkaar prabandhakon ko is baat kii vishesh sujh boojh or jaankaree pradaan karte hai ki kin paristhitiyon evam kaarnon k antargat shramik santhaan ko chhodkar chale jate hai
 Thus the manager finds himself capable of deciding whether the high rate of labor in his organization is due to poor working conditions, or the achievement of good work elsewhere, the labor policy or behavior of the management, the workers' own mistakes
 Or misconduct is the drabness of the behavior or work of the union leaders; Which of these factors is responsible for the high rate of labor, and what preventive measures can be adopted to eliminate them
 is prakaar ke bahirgaman saakshatkaaron ke pareekshan hetu prabandhakon ko apane-apane sansthaanon ke antargat avasar avashya pradaan kiya janaa chahie taaki ucch shramavart kii daron ke karkon kaa pataa lagaaya ja sake or unako samaapt karne ke liye nirodhatmak upayon ko bhi dhundha ja sake
 To run this process smoothly, joint committees of Malika and Laborers should be formed in each institution
 in samitiyon main maalikon or shramikon ke pratinidhi hone chahie
 Also, joint efforts should be made in this direction
 saamanyatya shramavart kam karne ke liye moulik rup se un sabhi upayon kaa apanaaya janaa chahie jo tyaag patr or nishkasana se sambandhit hua karte he
 In order to reduce the resignations, they will have to do all the work while improving the conditions and conditions of the work under the institute so that the workers can experience a sense of satisfaction and do not hurt their self esteem at any level
 shramik ko jo vetanman santhaan ke baahar praapt ho saktaa he use santhaan ke antargat utana vetan avashya diya janaa chahie
 In order to reduce expulsion, workers will have to reduce disloyalty by increasing their sense of devotion to work and institution
 iske liye shramikon ke saath prabandhakon, nirikshakon evam sahakarmiyon ko sahanubhuti purna vyavhaar karnaa chahie
 Workers should be given an opportunity to participate in management, as well as to overcome the difficulties experienced by them, reduce the plurality of labor unions and develop democratic values among the workers so that mutual respect in their own class To be increased

 Tariff is the tax levied on tariffs, imports or exports
 tarriff, aam taur par sangrakshanvaad, deshon ke bich hone vaale vyapaaron ko simit karne vaali aarthik niti, se judaa hua he
 For political reasons, tariffs are generally levied on imported goods, although tariffs can also be levied on exported goods
 aajkal kii tulana main, ateet main, tarriff se sarkari rajasav kaa ek bahut bada hissaa aata tha

 plant kaa digester airtite hota he jisamen vyarth padaarth daalaa jaataa he or gas holder main gas kaa sangrahan hota he
 The construction of a biogas plant depends on the gas requirement and the availability of waste material
 saath hi digester ke batch feeding yaa lagaataar feeding par bhi
 The biogas plant is built on or below the ground surface and both models have their advantages and disadvantages
 sataha par bana plant rakh-rakhaav main aasaan hota he or use suraj kii garmi se bhi laabh hota he, lekin iske nirmaan main adhik dhyaan dena hota he kyonki vahaan digester ke andruni dabaav par dhyaan dena hota he
 In contrast, plants below the surface are easy to construct but difficult to maintain

 Biogas is obtained by producing microbes by driving the excretory substances of cattle into the digester at low temperatures
 jaev gas main 75 pratishat methen gas hoti he jo bina dhunaa utpann kiye jalati he
 Unlike wood, charcoal and coal, it does not leave any residue like ash after burning

 Caution should only be taken that there is no drinking water source within a 15 meter radius of the biogas plant

 This kills most of the nutritional elements present in dung
 upala banane main pratidin kareeb 1-2 ghante samay bhi lagata he
 Therefore, instead of using cow dung for cooking, making bio gas from cow dung, using bio gas as fuel does not harm the nutrients because all the nutrients available to the plants are available in the bio gas slurry obtained from bio gas
 While living, there is no smoke in cooking, which does not have any adverse effect on the eyes of the housewife
 baio gas slori ko sidhe yaa chaaya main sukhaakar yaa varmi compost banaakar khaad ke rup main kheton main prayog karnaa chahie
 Nowadays diesel pump sets can also be run with bio gas, which saves diesel and other energy
 byogas sanyantr main gobar kii pachan kriya ke baad 25% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar gas ke rup main hota he or 75% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar khaad ke rup main hota he
 In a 2 cubic meter gas plant, in which about 50 kg of cow dung or 18-25 tons of dung is added in a year, about 10 tons of biogas slurry containing 80% moisture is obtained from that cow dung
 yah kheti ke liye ati uttam khaad hota he isamen nitrogen 1
5 se 2% phosphorus 1
0% evam potash 1
0% tak hota he
 When the fertilizer comes out in the form of slurry from the biogas plant, the nitrogen is present in the slurry as much nitrogen is also present in the slurry, but during the digestion in the plant, there is evidence of carbon conversion in the gas due to reduced carbon nitrogen
 The ratio decreases and the evidence of nitrogen appears to be increased

 2 ghan meter ke gas sanyantr main jisamen kareeb 50 kilo gobar roj yaa 18-25 ton gobar ek varsh main daalaa jaataa he, us gobar se 80% namiyukt kareeb 10 ton byogas slori kaa khaad praapt hota he
 It is a very good manure for farming, it contains nitrogen 1
5 to 2% phosphorus 1
0% and potash 1
0%
 byogas sanyantra se jab slori ke rup main khaad baahar aata he tab jitna nitrogen gobar main hota he utana hi nitrogen slori main bhi hota he, parantu sanyantra main pachan kriya ke dauraan carbon kaa roopaantar gas main hone se carbon kaa pramaan kam hone se carbon nitrogen anupaat kam ho jaataa he va isse nitrogen kaa pramaan badha hua prathit hota he
 20% nitrogen amo in thin slurry produced from biogas plant
 Nickel is in the form of nitrogen, so if it is used immediately by making drains in the field or mixed with irrigation water and left in the field, then its benefits like chemical fertilizers are immediately on the crop and increase in production by 10 to 20%

 This fertilizer is applied in non-irrigated farming in evidence of about 5 tonnes per hectare and in irrigated farming 10 tonnes per hectare
 byogas slori ke khaad main mukhya tatwon ke atirikt sookshm poshak tatv evam humas bhi hota he jisase mitti kaa pot sudharta he, jaldharan kshamta badhati he or sookshm jeevanu badhate he
 With the use of this manure, like other organic manure, nutrients are gradually available to the crops for 3 years
 yadi gobar gas sanyantr ghar ke paas va khet se dur he tab patali slori ko sangrahan karne ke liye bahut jagah lagati he va patali slori kaa sthaanantaran bhi kathin hota he aisi avasthaa main slori ko sookhaana aavashyak he

 Before the First World War, the socialist parties were of the view that the capitalist system is responsible for the wars and if the world war started then it should be the duty of every socialist party to oppose the war strategy of its capitalist government and try to establish socialism by the civil war

 Only a negligible minority of socialists opposed the war, and some of these later became supporters of Vladimir Lenin and his communist international organization
 parantu vibhinn deshon ke samaajawaadee andolanon kii paraspar virdohi yudhniti ke kaaran unka aikya khatm ho gaya
 The Bolshevik party was one of several socialist parties in Russia
 1917 kii vishesh paristhitiyon main isko safalataa praapt hui
 The background of Russian socialism was different from the situation in other European socialisms
 roosi samrajya europe ke agrani deshon se udyog dhandhon main pichhadaa hua tha, at: yahan majdoor varg bahusankhyak or adhik prabhaavshaalee na ho sakaa
 There was also a lack of democratic governance and individual freedoms
 roosi buddhijivi or madhyamvarg inke liye icchhuk tha par jaarshahi damanniti ke kaaran inaki prapti kaa sanvaidhanik maarg avaruddhapraay tha
 Influenced by these circumstances, the first socialists there considered the rural commune of Russia as the basis of their ideas and considered the first step to the success of democraticism by destroying the Tsar by revolutionary path
 un vichaarkon main harjen, lavarove, charnishevski or baakunin mukhya hai
 Influenced by these, many intellectuals headed towards the revolution

 In 1901, it was named Social Revolutionary Party
 san 1917 kii bolshevik kranti ke samay tak yah rus kaa sabase bada samaajawaadee dal tha, parantu iskaa prabhavakshetra adhikanshat: gramin janata thi
 Its left side supported the Bolshevik revolution
 duusari samaajawaadee vichaardhaara, jisamen bolshevik dal bhi sammilit tha, roosi saamaajik janavaadee majdoor party ke naam se prasiddh he
 Its influence was mainly in the civilian working class
 rus main udyog kam the, parantu bade paimaane ke the or apekshaya adhik mazdooron ko naukar rakhte the
 Hence there was more political consciousness and organization among these laborers
 loktantr ke abhaav main mazdooron kaa sangharsh karnaa kathin tha, isliye majdoor varg krantikari prabhaav main aa gaya or germany jaisi paristhitiyon ke kaaran yahan ke adhikansh majdoor netaa bhi marxvaadi tathaa germany ke saamaajik loktantrvaadi dal se prabhavit hue
 Around 1890 Axelrod and Plekhanov established the first working group in Petersburg which later became the basis of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party in 1898
 roosi saamaajik loktantrvaadi majdoor party ke netaa kattar marxvaadi the, at: unhone punraritivaad ko asweekaar kiya or marxvad ko viksit kar roosi paristhitiyon main lagu kiya
 The level of living of the workers had improved, it was difficult not to believe this truth, but Plekhanov proved that the rate of capitalist exploitation is increasing due to the use of new machines and the expected increase in wages
 bukharin kaa tark tha ki samrajyavaadee desh upniveshon ke shoshan dwaara apane shramjivi varg ko santusht rakh pate hai
 Trotsky etc
 said that the crisis of the capitalist has become ubiquitous and in this situation it is possible that the revolution should not be in the leading countries of Western Europe but in the relatively backward countries, where the communist link is the weakest
 kuch vichaarkon ne sarvapratham samaajawaadee kranti kaa sthaan rus ko batalaaya
 Trotsky and Lenin opined that socialist revolution can succeed at the same time that it is difficult to establish socialism in only one country without a permanent revolution spread across several countries
 baad main lenin or stallin ne is siddhant main sanshodhan kar ekadeshiy samaajwaad ke aadhaar par soviet satta kaa nirmaan kiya
 Nikolai Lenin coordinated the above ideas and led the organization of the Bolshevik Party and the October Revolution
 san 1903 kii landan conference main roosi saamaajik loktantrvaadi majdoor dal ne apane samaajawaadee adarsh ko spasht kiya, parantu isi varg dal ke andar do vichaardhaaraen saamne ain or kalantar main unhone do dalon kaa rup dhaaran kiya
 In this conference, the nationalization of the means of production, the abolition of zamindari, the right to self-build the colonies, the revolutionary path to attain the goal and the dictatorship of the proletariat after the revolution - this policy was accepted, but there were differences in the leaders regarding the organization of the party Gone
 prashn tha ki dal kii sadsyta keval kaaryakartaaon tak simit ho athwa aadarshon ko sweekaar karanevaala prayek vyakti uskaa adhikari ho or kya kendriya samiti ko dal kii shakhaon ke bhang karne or unke sthaan main nai shakhaon kii niyukti karne kaa adhikaar ho? lenin ek faujee anushaasanwale suvyavasthit dal ke paksh main tha or conference main uskaa bahumat tha, at: is dhara kaa naam bolshevik padaa or duusari dhara menshevik kahalaai
 Later on, more differences emerged between these parties
 menshavik dal pehle jaarshahi kaa ant kaa poonjeewaadi loktantratmak kranti karnaa chahta tha or is kranti main vah poonjeewaadi dalon ke vam paksh se sahyog karnaa chahta tha, parantu 1905 kii kranti ke baad lenin uske saathi is nishkarsh par pahunche ki samaajawaadee kranti ke bhay ke kaaran poonjeevaad pratikriyaavaadi ho gaya he, at: vah poonjeewaadi loktantratmak kranti kaa netritv karne main bhi asamarth he
 Therefore, only the proletariat can lead this revolution and it is possible to combine this revolution with the proletarian revolution and establish socialism immediately after the monarchy
 kranti main kisaanon kaa sahyog praapt karne ke liye lenin samantvaadi jameen ko kisaanon main baantne ke paksh main tha, menshavik uskaa turant samajikaran karnaa chaahate the
 The Bolshevik Party opposed the First World War and gave the slogan of civil war to establish socialism

 In this state, the means of production - industries, trade, trade, exchange, land etc
 - were nationalized and the economic and political power of the exploiting class was abolished

 Lenin's ideas are labeled communism, but after Lenin Joseph Stalin Maotsetung Nikita Khristov and communist leaders of various countries have interpreted and developed these ideas
 ye sabhi vichaar samyawad kii koti main aate hai
 In Stalin's views, his right to self-determination to the colonies, planned economy ie five-year plans etc
 and farming in collective and state ownership are the main ones

 The Yugoslav side said that the Soviet government hindered their industrial advancement and limited their independence
 unke ye laanchhan baad main satya siddh hue parantu us samay titowad ko punraritivaad, tratskivaad athwa samrajyavad kaa pitthu kaha gaya
 At the level of doctrine, Tietism emphasized national communism, decentralization of power, private ownership of land by peasants, workers' control over industries in place of state and bureaucracy, and the communist party and greater independence within the country
 tito ke in vichaaron kaa prabhaav purvi europe ke anya samyavaadee deshon par bhi padaa he
 By accepting the demand for equality between communist countries, Khrushkov accepted Titoism in part, but at the same time he also made several important amendments to Lenin Stalinism
 lenin kaa vichaar tha ki jab tak samrajyavad kaa ant nahin hota sansar main yuddh hote rahenge, parantu khrushchov ke anusaar is samay pragati kii shaktiyaan itani majboot hai ki vishwayuddh ko roka ja saktaa he or poonjeewaadi tathaa samaajawaadee vyavasthaaon ke bich shantimay sashastitv sambhav he
 He also says that under these circumstances, socialism is not only a revolutionary way of establishing, but it is possible to establish it in different countries by different communist parties in evolutionary and peaceful ways
 vishwa ke anya deshon main samyavaadee vichaardhaara par uparyukt vichaar parivartan kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa he
 After the revolt of Tito, other communist countries of East Europe have also tried to be independent of Soviet influence
 roosi samyavaadee khrushchev ke sanshodhano ko asweekaar karte hai or soviet tathaa china ke bich saidhantik hi nahin sainya sangharsh bhi vikat rup dhaaran karata ja rahaa he
 Almost all communist parties in the world are divided on the basis of Soviet and Chinese ideologies
 Some thinkers also emphasize the theoretical and organizational independence of national communist parties
