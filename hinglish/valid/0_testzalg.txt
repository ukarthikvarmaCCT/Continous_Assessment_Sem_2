 Productivity is the average measure of production efficiency
 utpaadan prakriya main output or input ke anupaat ko utpaadakta kah sakate hai
 The idea of productivity first came to light in 1766 in the article by Quessne, the founder of naturalism
 bahut samay tak iskaa arth aspasht rahaa
 Total productivity refers to the ratio between the cost of production of goods and services in the form of goods and services and the means used in the process of production
 utpaadan ke antargat un sabhi vastuon evam sevaaon ko sammilit kiya jaataa he, jinke antargat na keval audyogikaran evam krishi sambandhi utpaada padaarth sammilit hote hai, balki chikitsakon, shikshakon, dukaanon, karyaalayon, parivahan sansthaanon tathaa anya seva udyogon main rat vyakti bhi sammilit hote hai
 By cost, we mean all the efforts involved in production ie the work of managers, craftsmen and workers
 is prakaar purna utpaadakta kii avadharana ko spasht karne hetu nimna sutara ko prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he- Often the words 'productivity' and 'production' are mistaken to be considered synonymous
 vastav main in donon shabdon main paryaapt antar he
 'productivity' is the ratio of total origin to means
 samast sadhano se praapt hone vaala maal evam sevaayen ‘utpaadan‘ he
 It does not take into account the expenditure aspect as production can be increased by spending more and more on the means, but it is not necessary that productivity has increased
 udaahranarth yadi ek kaarkaane main 1000 vyakti 500 vastuein banaate hai tathaa doosar kaarkaane main samaan dasha main 2000 vyakti keval 800 vastuein banaate hai
 Certainly the production of the second factory is higher than the first factory, but the productivity of the second factory is less than the first factory

 It is difficult to prove that the increase in production is a result of certain factors or is due to the combined effect of many factors

 amritraay arya - mandir main ek vyaakhyaan sunakar pratigya karte hai ki ve ek vidhwaa se hi shaadi karenge
 Lalaji gets angry with this pledge that it is against the sect
 par prema uske nirnya kaa swagat karti he or us se apana prem tyaag deti he
 Now Prema's marriage with Dannad is decided, Dannad is hesitant that the girl who loves the friend will not be ready for this marriage
 par amritraay ke kaaran daananaad vivaah ke liye 'ho ' kehete hai
 Dannad and Prema get married
 lala badariprasad ke pados vasantkumar pravaah ke bich main jaakar dub jate hai isliye purna vidwa ban jaati he
 He has no one of his own
 at: lalaji apane ghar main use aashray dekhar uski raksha karte hai
 Kamalaprasad, son of Lalaji, is vicious and lustful
 purna ke saundarya se vah chakit ho jaat he or galatniti apanaakar use paane kaa prayaas karte rahata he
 He wants to trap Poorana by laying a trap and tries to win her mind by telling many false things
 sumitra, jo uski patni he-purna ko dhairya detii he or anyaay ke khilaaf ladne kii prerana detii he
 Dannad, after getting Prema, becomes a skeptic, not a saint
 unhen shaq he ki prema abhi amritraay ke prem se baahar nahin aayi
 They begin to go against Amritrai with Kamalaprasad's friendship and condemn him
 amritraay apni jameen -jaaydaad bechakar ' vanita-bhawan' kaa nirmaan karte hai jo vidadhvaaon or anaath balikaon kaa sharnalay he, uske sanchaalan ke liye amritraay chandaa vasul karnaa chaahate hai to kamalaprasad or daananaadh isaki bhi aalochana karte hai
 In a program, the people sent by Kamalaprasad attack Amritrai
 par prema bich main aakar unhen rokatii he
 His speech makes the Chanda - recovery program successful
 par isse daananaad or prema ke bich duuriu batch jaati he
 One day, Kamalaprasad takes Poorna away from the city to his garden
 vahaan purna par balaatkaar karne kii koshish karata he, to purna uske chehre par kursi de-markar bhaag jaati he, kamalaprasad bureetarah chot khaakar gir padataa he
 Poorna runs away to Amritrai's shelter and finds shelter in Vanita Bhavan
 purna ke kaaran kamalaprasad kii jagahansai hoti he or vah puri tarah badal jaataa he
 Here, Dananad also regrets his actions that he used to oppose Amritrai after coming to talk of the evil like Kamalaprasad
 ve amritraay se kshamaa maangate hai or amritraay to sahrday hai, ve bhi mitrataa kaa haath aage badhaate hai
 Prema is very happy with the reunion of the two friends and adopts Dannadh with all her heart
 vanita-bhawan main jaakar purna maansik shaanti kaa anubhav karti he
 That building is not only an ashram for widows, but also their training, it is the sale of things made by widows and this gives them a sense of self-reliance
 jab daananaad apane mitra ko pratigya kii yaad dilaate hai tab amritraay vanita bhawan kii ore dikhaakar soochna dete he ki ab uskaa nirvaah karne main hi pratigya puri hogi
 Dannad knows that now Amritrai will serve his life by remaining unmarried

 sumitra or prema ke paatr adarsh nari - paatr hai to kamalaprasad abalaaon par atyaachaar karanevaale dushton kaa pratinidhi he
 Premchand showed the solution of the legal problem in economic self-reliance, which is conductive
 premachand ne apane jivan main swyan ek bal - vidhwaa se vivaah karke samag ke saamne adarsh prastut kiya
 The language of the novel presented is simple and practical
 kahawaton or muhaavaron ke prayog se upanyaas sajiv ban padaa
 In every sense, this novel is one of Premchand's masterpieces

 Kamasutra is an ancient Kamasastra text of India composed by Maharishi Vatsyayan
 kamasutra ko uske vibhinn asana ke liye hi janaa jaataa he
 Kamasutra of Maharishi Vatsyayan is the first sexual code of the world in which detailed explanation and interpretation of psycho-religious principles and use of sexual love has been done
 arth ke kshetra main jo sthaan kautilya ke arthshaastra kaa he, kaam ke kshetra main vahi sthaan kamasutra kaa he
 Maharishi's time has not been determined due to lack of authorized evidence
 parantu anek vidwaanon tathaa shodhakartaaon ke anusaar maharishi ne apane vishwavikhyath granth kamasutra kii rachana isa kii tritiy shatabdi ke madhya main kii hogi
 Accordingly for the past seventeen centuries, the supremacy of Kamasutra has been prevalent in the whole world and is still intact today
 sansar kii har bhashaa main is granth kaa anuwaad ho chukaa he
 Many commentaries and editions of it have also been published, however, Jayamangala Bhasya of this book is considered authentic

 He started the book by saluting dharma-artha-kama

 Vatsyayan says that religion performs charity, so it is necessary to have a scripture that makes sense of religion
 arthsiddhi ke liye tarah-tarah ke upaay karne padate hai isliye un upayon ko bataanevaale arthshaastra kii aavashyaktaa padati he or sambhog ke paradheen hone ke kaaran stri or purush ko us paradheenata se bachane ke liye kaamshaastra ke adhyayan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Vatsyayan claims that this scripture is the teacher of religious and social rules of husband and wife
 jo dampati is shaastra ke anusaar daampaty jivan vyateet karenge unka jivan kaam-drushti se sadaa-sarvada sukhi rahegaa
 Husband will be content with each other for a lifetime
 unke jivan main agepatnivrath yaa pativrat ko bhang karne kii cheshtaa yaa bhaavana kabhi paidaa nahin ho sakati
 Acharya says that just as scripture is needed for religion and meaning, similarly, Kamasutra has been created due to the need of scripture for work

 From the very beginning, you were interested in acting

 In 1930, he became oriented towards the stream of his creativity through three short plays
 prayag main unke naatak 'chaand', 'rupabh' patrikaon main na keval chape hi, balki inhone 'vir abhimanyu', aadi naatakon main bhaag liya
 All the compositions stored in 'bhor Ka Tara' were written in Prayag itself
 yah naam pratik rup main shilp or samvednaa donon drushtiyon se maathur ke rachanaatmak vyaktitv ke 'bhor kaa tara' hi he

 In 'bhor Ka Tara', the passion of poet Shekhar to occur or create in the environment is also found from the beginning

 In all the plays of 'shardiya', there is a feeling of seeing the problem in a broader perspective, but the circumcision of the problem is so small that it does not become the basis of any comprehensive truth

 'konark' is a great drama

 Despite the fact and theatricality of the incident, Mahashilpi Vishu's concern and courageous use of the ritual, the process of fighting and combating the totalitarian tendency of the system and its culmination make the play an important creation
 kalpana kii rachanaatmak samarthy or samskruti kaa samakaleen anubhav konark kii safal natya kriti kaa kaaran he
 Controversy over the end of Konark and eventual intensity and liquidation is possible, but a question mark on its communicative effect is not possible

 The use of Sputnik, Apollo etc

 The fertility of the earth, the use of water and shovel-spade etc

 'paramparashil natya' mahatvapurn samiksha-kriti he
 In this, apart from discussing the tradition of folk theater and its potential, attempts have been made to explain the basic vision of the play

 At a party that same night, Priya comes to know about Raj's new boss Sonia Roy, who is surprised to find that Sonia is actually the wife of the aging Mr
 Roy
 raaj or uske sahyogi bhi sonia kii sundarataa, or uske pati or uski umr ke antar ke bare main baaten karte hai; raaj bhi mazaaq-mazaaq main ek baar kah detaa he ki uske aakarshak vyaktitv ke kaaran hi usee itane bade pad par padonnat kiya gaya he
 By this time, it is also clear that Raj has met Sonia even before
 ek flashbek drishy main sonia ke saath raaj kaa pichhlaa rishta bhi darshaya jaataa he
 Five years ago, Raj and Sonia meet on a beach in Cape Town
 ve pyaar main pad jate hai or ek saath rahane lagate hai
 Sonia soon becomes pregnant with Raj's child, which makes Raj quite happy, and proposes marriage to Sonia
 haalaanki, sonia is prastaav ko thukraa detii he, or raaj ko bataati he ki vah is garbhavastha ko samaapt karne ja rahi he, kyonki sonia ke anusaar uskaa yah baccha bhavishya main or adhik dhan, prasiddhi, shakti or pratishtha praapt karne ke uske iraade main baadha utapann kar saktaa he
 Their relationship ends immediately
 agle din, rakesh company ke ek nae mobile handset main aaye ek dosha ke bare main raaj ko bataata he: us phone se kisi vyakti ko kol lagane par vah kol uske saath-saath phone kii sampark suchi main sanchit kisi bhi yadrichhik vyakti ko lag rahi thi
 Raj immediately decides to stop producing mobiles, for which he needs Sonia's permission
 sonia is maamle par charchaa ke liye raaj ko apane ghar main aamantrit karti he, jahaan vah raaj se uttejk baaten karne lagati he, haalaanki raaj unhen andekha karata rahata he
 She then tries to woo Raj with more force, but Raj opposes it
 jab raaj vahaan se jane lagata he, to sonia uski baat naa maanane par use dandit karne kii dhamkee detii he
 The next day, she learns that Sonia complains to her husband that he has sexually assaulted her
 chunki raaj hameshaa hi sonia ko aakarshak kahata rahaa tha, isliye nirdosh hone kaa uskaa daawa asweekaar kar diya gaya, or company us par tyaagptr dene kaa dabaav daalane lagi
 Raj asks for help from Chautrani, who advises him not to resign, and continues to work
 maamla nyaayalay main pahunchataa he; sonia or roy apana paksh rakhane ke liye adhivaktaa patel ko niyukt karte hai
 Initially, almost all evidence is found against Raj, and the episode receives extensive media coverage
 isi samay raaj kaa bank manager bainkak se lautataa he, or use ek tepe detaa he, jisamen sonia or raaj kii sari baaten darj hoti hai
 The tape proves to be genuine, but before Chautrani can present it to the court as evidence, he is badly injured in a car accident sponsored by Sonia, and the tape is destroyed
 iske baad priya nyaayalay main raaj kaa cese ladane kaa nishchay karti he
 When Priya asks Raj why she had called her bank manager from Sonia's house, he then remembers that she had connected the phone to Rakesh, but due to a malfunction in that phone model, a call bank manager Also went to, who recorded it
 iske baad priya nyaayalay main kep toun main raaj ke saath sonia ke puraane rishte ko ujagar karti he, or phir aakhir main rakesh ke wais mail ko adaalat main sakshya ke taur par prastut karti he - yah bataate hue ki us din raaj or sonia ke bich vastav main kya hua tha
 This makes it clear that Sonia had married Roy in order to gain money, power and prestige, but when she could not pursue sexual relations, she attempted to resume her relationship with Raj
 falswaroop, raaj nyaayalay se bari ho jaataa he or roy sonia ko chhod kar hameshaa ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 Suffering and humiliated by guilt, Sonia commits suicide by jumping from a building
 ant credit drishy main raaj or priya apane bachche ko chalanaa sikhaa rahe hote hai

 Being based on a controversial subject such as sexual harassment, Chopra was apprehensive about playing such a bold character, but accepted the role when convinced by abbas-mustan and Subhash Ghai

 The theory of balance of power assumes that a nation is more secure when the military capability is divided in such a way that no single state is so powerful that it alone suppresses other states
 shakti santulan kii avadharana lagbhag 15 veen shatabdi se antarrashtriya str main prachlit he
 Perhaps this is why some writers call it the basic principle of international politics, some call it the public principle or the fundamental principle of politics
 saadhaaran shabdon main shakti santulan kaa arth he jab ek rajya / rajyon kaa samooh duusare rajya / rajyon ke samooh ke saapeksh apni shakti itani badha le ki vah uske samakaksh ho jaae
 But there is no consensus on the definition of this notion
 shaayad isiilie innins el claude kaa kahana he ki yah aisi avadharana he jisaki paribhaasha kii samasya nahin he balki samasya yah he ki isaki bahut sari paribhaashaayen hai
 Before these definitions, it is also necessary to state that there are two types - simple and complex
 saral yaa saadhaaran shakti santulan jab hota he jab yah tulana do raashton yaa do raashton ke bich main sidhe taur par ho
 But if this equilibrium is between the mutual of two communities and also internally in the communities involved, then it is called complex balance
 iske sandarbh main vidwaanon ne vibhinn paribhaashaayen di hai jo is prakaar hai- Every nation aspires to gain more power than other nations to maintain or change the status quo
 iske parinamswaroop jis dhaanche kii aavashyaktaa hoti he vah shakti santulan kehalaata he
 The balance of power is some degree of stability or stability in equilibrium or international relations that can be achieved with the help of treaties or other means between states
 shakti santulan vah vyavastha he jiske antargat prayek rajya main yah vishwaas banaaye rakhane kaa satat praytn kiya jaataa he ki yadi rajya akraman kaa praytn karte hai to unhen ajey duusare rashtron ke samooh kaa pratirodh karnaa hoga
 The balance of power refers to a just system of power between members of the nation's families that prevents a nation from becoming so powerful that it does not impose its will on another nation
 is prakaar shakti santulan ko vidwaanon ne vibhinn dashshtiyon se dekha he
 Some see it as a distribution of power, some as an equilibrium between groups, some as stability, some as war and instability
 kehane kaa arth yah he ki in paribhaashaon main sarvasammati kaa abhaav he
 This is probably because there are many meanings / uses of balance of power, due to which this confusion has remained
 mukhya taur par shakti santulan ko chaar sandarbhon main prayog kiya jaataa he- According to Quincy Right, the principle of balance of power is based on five beliefs- shakti santulan kii nimnlikhit visheshtaayen hoti hai- In general it is a policy to maintain status quo, but in reality it is always dynamic and variable
 yah koi daivi vardaan nahin he, apitu yah maanav ke satat hastkshep kaa parinaam he
 It is defined both subjectively and objectively
 itihaaskaar hameshaa iskaa vastunishth akalan karte hai jabaki rajanyik hameshaa isaki vyaktiparak vivechna karte hai
 Although it is a mechanism for establishing peace, it rarely establishes peace
 yah mukhyatya mahashaktiyon kaa khel he
 Small nations only play the role of spectator
 iske sahi sanchaalan hetu ek sanchaalak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo aaj ke yug main nadaarad he
 It gives equal distribution of powers on the basis of equilibrium
 parantu yah antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke itihaas ko dekhne se gyaat hota he ki aisa samay kabhi nahin rahaa
 The system of balance of power is hardly visible in international politics, because it is not possible to measure and stabilize the element of power

 lekin jab ek raashtra maitra sandhiyon ke dwaara apni shakti badha letaa he tab anya rajya bhi ashankit hokar aapas main prati maitra sandhiyaan karne lagate hai
 The end of this sequence is organized by all the nations of the world into opposing groups

 haa kuch had tak yah siddhanth apane uddeshyon main safal ho sakaa
 The following reasons for this theory not being able to completely curb the development of power - uparokt vichaaron se yah spasht he ki shakti vistaar yaa shakti sangharsh rokane hetu yah siddhanth purnroopen sakasham nahin he
 But it does get partial success through this, because - First, small states can assure their security
 dwitiya, yah kisi badi shakti ke aadhipaty sthapana par bhi ankush rakhega
 Third, it is also capable of avoiding wars
 chaturth, samprabhu rajyon par kisi kendriya satta ke abhaav main antarrashtriya kanoon bhi keval shakti santulan se hi sambhav he
 Therefore, it is able to partially block the possibilities of establishing autocratic or hegemonic power

 Description of beginning poetry pracheen sanskrit hindi kavyachaaryon ke matanusaar upalambh kavy mukhyat: shringaarakavy kaa ek bhed, jisamen nayika kii vishwast sakhi upalambh dekar nayak ko nayika ke anukool karti he
 But not only does Sakhi everywhere give a heroic message to the hero, but in a coincidence adornment, the heroine herself delivers the hero
 kahin-kahin nayika, pakshi, megh athwa pawan dwaara bhi nayak ko upalambh bhejti he
 This is often seen in disconnection
 lokkavy main virahinee nayika kaaga aadi pakshiyon ke madhyam se athwa pravasi pati ke nagaradi se aae pathik ke madhyam se upalambh detii he
 The new-born woman seems to be giving a call for the lack of affection of the kindred people of the maiden and the perceived neglect of her sister and brother

 But this definition is not complete in itself
 upalambh main maatr ulaahna nahin hota yaa priypaatr kii ninda hi nahin hoti; iskaa mukhya bhav he, kisi prakaar priy saahchary kii anubhuti yaa cheshtaa, sahyogakankshajanya vikalataa or milan kii abhilaashaa
 Due to this characteristic of the definition, the Upalambha poetry cannot be considered limited to adornment alone
 hindi bhakthikavy main upalambh paryaapt maatra main miltaa he

 In the tenth wing of Shrimad Bhagwat, there is a very beautiful description of Gopis giving salvation to Krishna by making Uddhav auspicious

 External positivism is a theory of epistemology, according to which knowledge of external object is obtained not by inference but directly
 pratyaksh gyaan sambhav maane bina anumaan nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 If the external object is never directly visible, then the existence of external object cannot be proved by mental patterns
 isliye bahya vastu kaa gyaan anivaary rup se pratyaksh hi hota he
 Whatever is seen or heard by the senses, external things are the same

 Guide is a 1965 Hindi language film
 yah bharat ke prasiddh angrezi lekhak aar ke narayan ke da guide naam ke upanyaas par aadhaarit he
 The film starts from the present when Raju is being released from jail and then the story goes on in the past
 raju ek guide he, jo paryatakon ko aitihaasik sthalon main ghumaakar apni kamai karata he
 One day, a rich and old archaeologist Marco arrives in the city with his young wife Rosie, the daughter of a prostitute
 marco shahar ke baahar gufaaon main kuch shodh karnaa chahta he or apane guide ke rup main raju ko kaam detaa he
 He discovers a new cave and is so lost in his work that Rosie ignores him
 jab marco gupha kii khoj main laga hua he, raju rozi ko saiyr sapate ke liye le jaataa he or uske nrity kshamta or maasoomiyat kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa karata he
 Rosie tells Raju that she is the daughter of a prostitute and how she became Marco's wife in order to gain respect in society, but has paid a huge price for it because she has a passion for dance while Marco is strongly disliked
 is bich, rozi jehar khaakar aatmahatya karne kii koshish karti he
 Upon receiving the news of this incident, Marco comes back from the caves and is quite annoyed to see Rosie recovering and tells Rosie that her attempt to commit suicide was a drama, otherwise she would have had more sleeping pills if she really wanted to die
 She could easily do this after eating
 ek din jab rozi gufaaon main jaati he to paati he ki marco ek adivasee ladki ke saath prem rach rahaa he
 Rosie and Marco have heard a lot about this and Rosie once again tries to commit suicide
 raju use samajhaata he ki aatmahatya paap he or vah apana sapana puraa karne ke liye zindaa rahe
 Rosie breaks up with Marco, but now she needs a place to hide her head and also the support of someone who gives her Raju
 raju ke samudaay main rozi ko bhi veshya hi mana jaataa he 
 Raju's mother and maternal uncle urge him to take Rosie out of the house but Raju refuses, so his mother leaves him and goes to live with his brother
 uskaa mitra or driver gaffoor bhi rozi ko lekar usase kinaaraa kar letaa he
 Raju's income ends and the entire city turns against him
 in sabake baavjood raju rozi ko ek gayak or nrutyaangna banane ke liye protsaahit karata he or uski madad karata he
 And soon Rosie becomes a star
 jyon-jyon rozi nai oonchaaiyaan chooti he, raju aawaragardi karne lagata he or use jue or nashe kii lat lag jaati he
 Now Marco comes back again
 roji ko waapas jeetne kii koshish karne ke man se, vah rozi se milane aata he or phulon kaa guladasta laata he
 Raju collides with her in the middle and Raju takes a bouquet of flowers from her
 marco raju se kahata he ki rozi ke kuch gahane he jo ek loker main jamaa hai or jinako nikaalane ke liye rozi ke hastakshar chahiyein
 Raju, in the fear that if Marco and Rosie meet again, does not re-establish their relationship, Rosie forged signatures in the locker papers, but does not allow Marco to meet Rosie
 is bich raju or rozi ke sambandhon main khatas aa jaati he jab vah raju ko apane paas aane se bhi manaa kar detii he or kahati he ki agar raju uske qareeb aayaa to vah baahar chali jaayegi
 Before this both of them had a debate and Rosie remembered Marco saying that perhaps Marco was right that the man should not live in a woman's income
 jawaab main raju kahata he ki yah rozi kii galatafahami he ki vah apane boote main star ban gayi he or usko star banane main raju kaa bhi bada haath he
 After some time, Rosie finds out the forgery
 raju ko do saal kii sazaa ho jaati he
 Rosie does not understand why Raju did the forgery while he can ask for money directly from Rosie
 raju ne paise kii khaatir nahin balki rozi ke pyaar main aisa kadam uthaaya tha kyonki vah marco or rozi ko milane nahin dena chahta tha
 Now the film returns to the present
 raju kii rihaai ke din rozi or raju kii maan jail main use lene aate hai lekin unhen pataa chalata he ki achche aacharan ke kaaran raju ko chah maheene pehle hi reeha kar diya gaya he
 Rosie and Raju's mother erase their estrangement
 rihaai hone ke baad raju akelaa bhatakta rahata he
 He wanders around because of poverty, despair, hunger and loneliness
 ek din vah kuch saadhuon kii toli ke saath ek chote se gaanv ke puraane mandir ke ahaate main so jaataa he or agle din us mandir se nikalne se pehle ek sadhu sote huye raju ke upar pitambar vastra udha detaa he
 The next day, Bhola, a farmer in the village, considers Raju to be a monk, sleeping in a Pitambar cloth
 bholaa kii bahan shaadi na karne kii zid kar rahi thi
 Bhola brings her to Raju and Raju convinces her to agree to the marriage
 bholaa or bhi aashwast ho jaataa he ki raju ek sadhu he
 He spreads this thing throughout the village
 gaanv vaale use sadhu maan lete hai or uske liye khaanaa or anya uphaar lekar aate hai or apni samasyaayein bhi usko bataate hai
 Now Raju comes to be known as Swamiji in that village and he also has differences with the Pandits of the village
 gaanv waalon ko ek kahani sunaate huye raju unako ek sadhu ke bare main bataata he ki ek baar ek gaanv main akaal pad gaya tha or us sadhu ne 12 din tak upwas rakhaa or us gaanv main barish ho gai
 Incidentally, there is a famine in the area of that village
 gaanv kaa ek murkh raju se vaartalap ke dauraan sunata kuch or he or gaanv waalon ko aakar bataata he ki swami ji ne varsha ke liye 12 din kaa upwas karne kaa nirnay liya he
 Raju falls into the fold
 pehle to raju iskaa virodh karata he
 He even tells Bhola that he is a prosecutor who has been punished because of a girl
 lekin is par bhi gaanv waalon kii us par se aasthaa kam nahin hoti he or vah kukhyat daaku ratnakar kaa udhaaharan dete hai jo aage chalakar valmiki ke naam se prasiddh hote hai
 Eventually Raju agrees to fast, although he does not believe that there is a relationship between a man keeping fast and rain
 lekin upwas ke dauraan raju kaa aadhyatmik vikaas hota he or uski khyaati dur-dur tak fail jaati he
 Thousands of visitors start coming to seek his blessings
 uski khyaati sunakar rozi, uski maan or uskaa dost gaffoor bhi usase milane aate hai
 Gafoor does not allow Bhola to enter the temple because he belongs to another religion
 raju madhyasthata karata he or kahata he ki insaaniyat, prem or paroapkaar hi uskaa dharm he
 Gradually, Raju's condition deteriorates
 aakhir main barahawein din varsha hoti he lekin raju kaa nidhan ho jaataa he
 While on one hand the villagers are jubilantly outside the temple, on the other hand, inside the temple, their relatives celebrate the mourning of his death
