 in programing bhashaao ko karyaanusaar chaar virgo main vibhajit kiya gaya he- vaigyanik programing bhashaaen- inkaa prayog mukhyat: vaigyanik kaaryo ke liye program banane main hota he, parantu iname se kuch bhashaaen ansi bhi hoti he jo vaigyanik kaaryo ke alaava anya kaaryo ko bhi utani hi dakshata se karti he
 Such as - ALGOL, BASIC, PASCAL, FORTRAN, etc
 vyavsaayik programing bhashaaen-vyapaarik kaaryo se sambandhit jaise-bahi khaataa, rozaanaamachaa, stock aadi kaa lekha jokha aadi vyapaarik programing bhashaao ke program dwaara atyant saralata se kiya ja saktaa he
 Such as PL1, COBOL, DBASE etc
 vishesh uddeshy programing bhashaaen-ye bhashaaen vibhinn kaaryo ko vishesh kshamta ke saath karne ke liye prayog kii jaati he
 Eg- APL360- Peripheral devices are used for best application
 yah bhashaa 1968 se prachlan main ai
 The logo-logo was developed just to simplify computer education
 is bhashaa main chithran itnaa saral he ki chote bachche bhi chithran kar sakate hai
 There is a special type of triangular shape for illustration in the logo language, called turtle
 monitor par pradarshit rahata he logo bhashaa ke nirdesho dwaara yah taratal, kisi bhi taraf gum saktaa he or aage-peeche chal saktaa he
 When the turtle moves, it streaks backwards on its path
 isse anek prakaar ke chitro ko saralata se banaaya ja saktaa he
 Multipurpose languages - languages that have the ability to perform many different types of tasks in the same way are called multipurpose languages
 jaise- BASIC,PASCAL,PL1| High level programming languages do not depend on a computer machine
 yah ek atyant mahatvapurn uplabdhi he
 This program runs evenly after the micro-correction, in different alus and control units, when the user of the program changes the computer
 in bhashaao main prayog kiye jane vaale shabd saamaanya angreji bhashaa main hote hai
 In these programming languages, the possibility of mistakes is less and mistakes can be found quickly and rectified
 prayog kiya gaya anuvadak compiler athwa interprator program main kis line or nirdesh main galati he yah swayan hi suchit kar detaa he
 It takes less time and labor to write a program
 in bhashaao main likhaa gaya program chalane main masini bhashaa or asembli bhashaa main likhe gayi program kii apeksha computer kii mukhya smriti main adhik sthaan gherta he
 These languages do not have flexibility because it is not under the control of the programmer due to the self-control of the translator
 lacheelepan se taatpary he ki kuch vishesh kaary in programing bhashaao main nahin kiye ja sakate hai athwa atyant kathinaayee se saath kiye ja sakate hai
 However, the features of a high-level programming language are more effective than its limitations
 at: vartmaan main yahi bhashaaen prayog kii jaati he
 If we look at the history of the development of programming languages, Dr
 Grace Hopper's name holds an important place
 inhone hi san 1952 ke aas-paas ucch stareey bhashaao kaa vikaas kiya tha
 In which a compiler was used
 dow haper ke nirdesan main do ucch stareey programing bhashaao ko viksit kiya gaya pehali-flowmatic or MATHEMATICS
 FLOWMATIC was a commercial programming language and MATHEMATICS was a language used in arithmetic calculations
 tab se lekar ab tak lagbhag 225 ucch stareey programing bhashaao kaa vikaas ho chukaa he
 Examples: FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, PASCAL

 The song Jhanda of India was composed by Shyamlal Gupta 'parshad'
 7 pad vaale is mul geet se baad main congress nen teen pad ko sanshodhit karke ‘jhandaageet’ ke rup main manyata di
 This song was not only declared a national song but also became a source of inspiration for many youth and young women to die on the country
 mul rup main likhaa gaya jhandaa geet is prakaar he:- The above-mentioned famous flag song titled "victorious World Tricolor Pyara, Jhanda Uncha Rahe Hamara" was accepted at the Congress session of 1938
 is geet kii rachana karne vaale shyaamalaal gupt 'parshad' kanpur main narval ke rahane vaale the
 He was born on 16 September 1893 in the Vaishya family
 garibi main bhi unhone ucch shiksha hasil kii thi
 He had an unwavering spirit of patriotism, which he often expressed in his brilliant national poems
 congress ke sakriy kaaryakarta rahane ke baad vah 1923 main fatehpur ke jila congress adhyaksh bhi bane
 He also ran a newspaper called 'secretary'
 jab yah lagbhag tay ho gaya tha ki ab aazaadee milane hi vaali he, us vakt congress ne desh ke jhande kaa chayan kar liya tha
 But the need for a different "flag song" was felt
 ganesh shankar 'vidhyaarthee', parshad ji ke kavy-kaushal ke kaayal the
 Vidyarthi requested the councilor to write the song Jhanda
 parshad ji kai dinon tak koshish karte rahe, par vah santoshjanak jhandaa geet nahin likh paae
 When Vidyarthi clearly told the councilor that he wanted a "flag song" till tomorrow morning in every situation, he froze with paper-pen at night
 aadhi raat tak unhone jhande par ek nayaa geet to likh daalaa, lekin vah khud unhen jamaa nahin
 Frustrated, at two o'clock in the night when he lay down to sleep, suddenly new feelings started rising within him
 vah bistar se uth kar nayaa geet likhane baith gayi
 The councilor felt as if his pen was moving by itself and 'bharat Mata' was writing that song to him
 yah geet tha-"vijayi vishwa tirangaa pyaara, jhandaa unchaa rahe hamaara
 "he got a lot of satisfaction by writing the song
 subah hote hi parshad ji ne yah geet 'vidhyaarthee' ji ko bhej diya, jo unhen bahut pasand aayaa
 When the song went to Mahatma Gandhi, he advised to shorten the song
 aakhir main, 1938 main congress ke adhiveshan main netaji subhaashachandr bose ne ise desh ke "jhandaa geet" kii sweekruti de di
 This historical session took place in Haripura

 The book edited by Pandit Chandrika Prasad 'jigyasu', the national flag or indigenous Khadi was banned in the British Raj because the editor had printed only five verses in the book with the title National Flag, except verse numbers 2 and 3 of this song
 
 yah pustak nai dilli sthit rashtriya abhilekhaagaar, bharat main pratibandhit sahitya awapti kramank 1679 ke antargat aaj bhi surakshit rakhi hui he
 Henry Vargasson was a talented Jewish philosopher, teacher, writer and speaker of France
 unhen 1927 kaa sahitya kaa nobel puraskaar pradaan kiya gaya tha
 In 1930, France awarded him its highest award
 anri bergasaan paris ke 'ruye lamarthin' naamak sthaan par, 18 oktober 1859 i
 ko paidaa hue the
 At the age of nine, he went to study in a school called 'liki Kandarchhet' near his home
 18 varsh kii umr tak vahaan usne vigyaan, ganit or sahitya kaa adhyayan kar 'bachalar' kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 Signs of his talent started appearing from here
 vidhyalay chhodane ke varsh usne ganit pratiyogita main bhaag lekar, kisi samasya kaa itnaa acha hal diya tha ki uske adhyapakon ne use 'enles da mathemetik' main prakashit kiya
 On leaving the said school, he joined the 'ecole Normal Superior' for higher level studies
 sahitya or vigyaan main samaan ruchi ke kaaran, vahaan usne darshan vishay liya
 This allowed him to receive education from three eminent philosophers of France
 ye darshan ke itihaas main prasiddh adarshavaadi raivaizan, botron tathaa juls lakeliye the
 Through his contacts, he came to know idealistic or platonic arguments against materialism
 isi samay usne unani darshanikon kaa adhyayan kiya, jisase use pataa chalaa ki darshan kaa dwandv pracheen kaal se chalaa aa rahaa he
 Heraclitus and Zino particularly attracted her attention
 hairaclitis gati ko sansar kaa moulik niyam maanata tha
 Zino gives the same place to stability
 heraclahtis kii nadi nirantar bahati rahati he; usamen koi do baar pair nahin daal saktaa
 For Zino his master Parmenides' stated power remains the same; Nothing changes, neither is born nor destroyed
 yaheen se henry bergasaan kaa maathaa thanka or usne darshan tathaa vigyaan kaa gahan adhyayan jari rakhane kaa sankalp kiya
 In line with this resolve, after finishing the education of 'ecole Normale', he went to 'licky Angers' as a teacher, where he stayed for two years
 phir 'clairmant' main adhyapankaarya karne chalaa gaya
 Now his thoughts were maturing and the students of 'claremont' were very impressed by his comprehension and succinct lectures
 hasanne ke kaarnon par uskaa vah saarvajanik bhaashan, jo 1900 main 'hasya' sheershak se pustakaakaar prakashit hua, 'clairmant' ke adhyapankaal main hi diya gaya tha
 It was here that he made it clear that he was not merely a philosopher within the ambit of the classroom, while editing Lucretius's treatise, presenting proper views on the relationship of poetry and philosophy in the role
 san 1889 main, usne apana shodh lekh 'les donnij imijiets de laa kanshiens' prastut kiya or 'doktiyar-es-letars' kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 His above article, in the form of a treatise, was published in 1896
 1910 main 'time and free vil' naam se prakashit pustak isi kaa anuwaad he
 From this book, the vision of Bergsan appeared in front of the curious and general readers
 usne anekta, sattakal tathaa chetana ke do do pahalu prastut kiye
 In general, plurality appears to be numerical, but Bergsan stated that the plurality of internal experiences can be qualitative rather than numerical or quantitative
 isi prakaar, sattakal athwa vah samay jisamen ghatnaayen ghatit hoti hai niravyav, athwa ekares maaloom hota he, kintu vah savyav he
 The reason for the seeming immateriality is intelligence, which looks at the dissolved ingredients separately
 chetana kii vyakhya karte hue usne kaha ki vah chetana, jo pruthak avasthaaon main vibhajit rahati he, satahi chetana he
 True consciousness remains below that
 use kshanon main nahin baanta ja saktaa
 The publication of the said book attracted the attention of the then thinkers to Henry Bergson
 unhen laga ki kaant ke baad, vah darshan kii moulik samasyaon par ek naveen drushti daalane ja rahaa tha
 As a result of this effect, in 1898 he got a place in 'ecole Normale'
 usee varsh, 'maitiyar et memvir' prakashit kar usne apni niyukti ko uchit siddh kiya
 This book of Bergsan was published in English in 1911 under the name 'matter and Memory'
 isamen smritidosho ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par, usne 'man or padaarth' ke dwait kii samasya saral karne kaa praytn kiya
 This was a profound problem of modern philosophy
 rine da karte se lekar emanuel kaant tak sabhi darshanik maathapai karte chale aa rahe the, kintu vivaad kaa ant kaant ke is kathan se hua tha ki man or padaarth, athwa prakruti main gyaata-gyey sambandh he, kintu man buddhi ke dwaara jaanata he or buddhi ke jaanane ke kuch bandhe hue tareeke hai
 Therefore, she squid her undetectable objects
 isse vyavhaar or parmarth kaa bhed baraabar bana rahata he
 Bergsan partially accepted Kant's view
 usne yah mana ki buddhi aantarik satya ko desh main rakhkar hi jaanati he
 She inspects the objects from all around and calculates their various aspects, one by one
 gyaan kii yah vidhi paryaapt nahin he, kyonki prakruti kaa satya sthir nahin, pravahamaan satya he
 It is a constant change, which reveals innovations every minute
 prakruti nirjeev padaarth nahin, vah jivan se otprot he
 The substance is the lava which the bursting life force throws out
 prakruti kaa saar yahi jeevanshkti he, jo ek nirantarata he
 a shallow study of memory proves the difference between past and present, but a subtle study shows that memory presents only those parts of past which are necessary for present action
 sampurna satya kaa gyaan antardrushti se hota he, jo jivan kii dhara kii hi bhanti pravahamaan anubhav he, aparokshanubhuti he, sahanubhuthaik gyaan he
 The reputation of Bergsan increased
 kaant ke mat se utpann agyeyata ko usne avastavik siddh karne kaa praytn kiya tha
 In 1900 AD, he was appointed as a teacher of Greek philosophy in 'college the France'
 vahiin kuch samay baad, vah prasiddh darshanik evam samajashastri, tardi ke sthaan par, aadhunik darshan kaa adhyaaapak hua
 Now, he was considered the leader of a new biography
 uske darshanik lekh france se baahar bhi chap rahe the
 Educated people from all over Europe were reading them
 saat varsh baad, 1907 main bergasaan kii ati prasiddh pustak 'el ebolution kriyetris' chhapi
 Its English translation, 'creative Abolition', was published in 1911
 is pustak main, usne us dasharn ko jise vah samay evam smriti sabandhi samasyaon ke vivechan se pichley granthon main pratipaadit kar chukaa tha, jaivik vikaas ke vistrut adhyayan ke aadhaar par spasht karne kaa praytn kiya
 Conclusion Even though it is not new, the book is very interesting, abundant examples of living animals bring the book very close to the human mind
 is pustak ke prakaashan ke baad, 14 varsh bergasaan adhyaapan ke atirikt, europe or america ke vibhinn nagaron main, samay samay par bhaashan detaa rahaa
 In 1921, he resigned from the college
 kintu 'anareri adhyaaapak ke rup main kalege se uskaa sabandh san 1940 tak bana rahaa
 He was now becoming more interested in the works of the public interest
 kai antarrashtriya sahyog samitiyon main usne kaam kiya

 In the following weeks, with Ashley gaining even more shares, Shepherd eventually agreed to sell 28 percent of his claim before the offer expired, making it unlisted, though given to previous contacts by other parties
 In response to the response, Shepherd publicly stated that it was "impossible to buy" and indicated that they could also offer it in opposition Are

 Daksha Prajapati was born by Brahma ji as his psyche son like other Prajapatis
 daksh prajapati kaa vivaah swymbhuv manu kii tritiy kanya prasuti ke saath hua tha
 Daksha was the god of kings
 brahmaji ke putr daksh prajapati kaa vivaah swymbhuv manu kii putree prasuti se hua tha
 Maternity gave birth to sixteen girls out of which a girl named Swaha was married to Agni Dev, a girl named Swadha with Pitrigan, a girl named Sati married to Lord Shankar and the remaining thirteen girls were married to Dharma
 dharm kii patniyon ke naam the- shraddha, maitri, dayaa, shaanti, tushti, pushti, kriya, unnati, buddhi, medha, titiksha, hri or murti
 According to Vishnupuran and Padmapuran, Daksha had a total of 24 girls, whose names are as follows: daksh ke prajapati banane ke baad brahma ne use ek kaam saunpa jiske antargat shiv or shakti kaa milaap karwaanaa tha
 At that time both Shiva and Shakti were different
 isiliye brahma ji ne daksh se kaha ki ve tap karke shakti mata ko prasann karen tathaa putree rup main praapt karen
 After penance, Mother Shakti said to Daksha, "I will be born as your daughter and become the Lord of Shambhu
 jab aap kii tapasya kaa punya ksheen ho jayega or aapke dwaara meraa anadar hoga tab main apni maaya se jagat ko vimohit karke apane dham chali jaaongi
 Thus Shakti was born as Sati
 prajapati daksh kaa bhagavan shiv se manomalinya hone ke kaaran rup main teen mat hai
 According to one belief, Brahma initially had five heads
 brahma apane teen siron se vedapth karte tathaa do sir se veda ko gaaliyaan bhi dete jisase krodhit ho shiv ne unka ek sir kaat diya
 Brahma was the father of Daksha
 at: daksh krodhit ho gaya or shiv se badla lene kii baat karne laga
 But this view is fragmented by other authentic references
 shrimadbhagwatmahapurana main spasht varnit he ki janm ke samay hi brahma ke chaar hi sir the
 According to another opinion, despite Shakti himself being prophetically said to be the wife of Lord Shiva himself, Daksha did not consider Shiva to be in accordance with Sati
 isliye unhone sati ke vivaah-yogya hone par unke liye swayamvar kaa aayojan kiya tathaa usamen shiv ko nahin bulaayaa
 Still Sati put Varmala on the earth by saying 'shivaaya Namah' and after appearing there, Lord Shiva took the Varmala and went to Kailash, making Sati his wife
 is prakaar apni ichha ke viruddh apni putree sati dwaara shiv ko pati chunane ke kaaran daksh shiv ko pasand nahin karte the
 The third opinion is most prevalent
 iske anusaar prajapatiyon ke ek yajna main daksh ke padhaarney par sabhi devataaon ne uthakar unka sammaan kiya, parantu brahma ji ke saath shivaji bhi baithe hi rahe
 Daksha felt insulted by Shiva for not being respected by him as his son, that is, he was like a son, and he used his hatred towards Shiva and henceforth cursed him not to part with the gods in the yagya
 
 is prakaar in donon kaa manomalinya ho gaya
 After the said event, Prajapati Daksha conducted a huge yagna in his capital Kankhal, in which he did not invite his Jamata Shiva and daughter Sati to come to the yagna
 shankar ji ke samajhane ke baad bhi sati apane pita ke us yajna main bina bulaaye hi chali gayi
 In the sacrificial place, Daksha Prajapati insulted Sati and Shankar
 apmaan na sah paane ke kaaran sati ne tatkaal yajyasthal main hi yogagni se swayan ko bhasma kar diya
 On receiving the news of Sati's death, Lord Shankar produced Virabhadra and caused the sacrifice of that yajna by him
 virbhadra ne purv main bhagavan shiv kaa virodh tathaa uphaas karne vaale devataaon tathaa rishiyon ko yathayogy dand dete hue daksh prajapati kaa sir bhi kaat daalaa
 Later on Lord Brahma prayed by Lord Brahma, Lord Shankar got Daksha Prajapati in exchange for his head and provided the goat head with his yagya
 daksh-yajna-vidhwans kii katha ke vikaas ke spashtatah teen charan hai
 The first phase of this story is in the Shantiparva of Mahabharata
 katha ke is praathmik rup main bhi daksh kaa yajna kankhal main hua tha iskaa samarthan ho jaataa he
 There is no clear mention of yagna in Kankhal here, but in the country of Gangadwar, there is a mention of Yajna and Kankhal comes under Gangadwar
 is katha main daksh ke yajna kaa vidhwans to hota he parantu sati bhasma nahin hoti he
 In fact, Sati lives with her husband Lord Shankar on Kailash and is extremely distraught when her father Daksha does not participate in the invitation and yagya
 unki vyakulata ke kaaran shivaji apane mukh se virbhadra ko utpann karte hai or vah ganon ke saath jaakar yajna kaa vidhwans kar daalata he
 However, neither Virbhadra beheads nor consumes Daksha
 swaabhaavik he ki bakre kaa sir jodne kaa prashn hi nahin uthta he
 In fact, in this story, it is said to cut off the head of 'yajna' i
e
 completely destroy the 'yajna', which was added in later stories by cutting the head of 'daksha'
 is katha main daksh 1008 naamon ke dwaara shivaji kii stuti karata he or bhagavan shiv prasann hokar unhen vardaan dete hai
 The second phase of the development of this tale is described from the Shrimad Bhagavat Maha Purana to the Shiva Purana
 isamen sati hathpurvak yajna main sammilit hoti he tathaa kupit hokar yogagni se bhasma bhi ho jaati he
 It is natural that when Sati is consumed in Yogagni, from where will her corpse be saved! Therefore, there is no question of Shiva's wandering etc
 with his corpse
 aisa koi sanket katha ke is charan main nahin miltaa he
 In this story, Virbhadra originates from Shiva's jata and burns Daksha's head
 parinamswaroop use bakre kaa sir joda jaataa he
 The third phase of the development of the story is described in the subpuranas like Devipuran
 jisamen sati jal jaati he or daksh ke yajna kaa virbhadra dwaara vidhwans bhi hota he
 Here Virbhadra originates from the third eye of Shiva and the head of Daksha is also cut
 phir stuti karne par shiv ji prasann hote hai or daksh jivit bhi hota he tathaa virbhadra use bakre kaa sir jod detaa he
 However, here the Puranikars further increase the story and later Lord Shiva gets the body of Sati safely and resplendently found in the Yajnashala itself
 tab us laash ko lekar shivaji veikshipt kii tarah bhatakate hai or bhagavan vishnu kramshah khand-khand rup main chakra se laash ko katate jate hai
 In this way, 51 Shakti Peethas are formed by falling of different parts of the corpse at different places
 spasht he ki katha ke is tisare rup main aane tak main sadiyon yaa sahasrabdiyon kaa samay laga hoga
 In this way, the parts of Sati's body and the ornaments that were worn, wherever they fell, Shakti Peethas came into existence
 shaktipeethon kii sankhya vibhinn granthon main bhinn-bhinn bataayi gayi he
 The number of Shaktipeeths in Tantra Chudamani is stated to be 52
 devibhagwat main 108 shaktipeethon kaa ullekh he, to devigita main 72 shaktipeethon kaa zikr miltaa he
 51 Shaktipeeths are discussed in Devipuran

 uski mrityu ke baad 1210 isvi main aramshaah ne satta sanbhali parantu uski hatya iltutamish ne 1211 isvi main kar di
 Iltutmish's power was temporary and was challenged by many Muslim rich
 kuch qutubi amiron ne uskaa saath bhi diya
 He strengthened his power by brutally suppressing many of his opponents
 iltutamish ne muslim shaskaon se yuddh karke multan or bengal par niyantran sthapit kiya, jabaki ranthambhore or shivalik kii pahadiyon ko hindu shaskaon se praapt kiya
 Iltutmish ruled until 1236 AD
 iltutamish kii mrityu ke baad dilli sultanate ke bahut se kamjor shaasha rahe jisame uski putree razia sultanaa bhi shaamil he
 This order continued till the power of Ghiyasuddin Balban, who ruled from 1266 to 1287 AD
 balban ke baad kaikubad ne satta sanbhali
 He made Jalal-ud-din Feroz Shah Khilji his commander
 khilji ne kaikubad kii hatya kar satta sanbhali, jisase gulam vansh kaa ant ho gaya
 During the Ghulam dynasty, Qutub-ud-din Aibak started construction of Qutub Minar and kuwatt-e-islam Mosque, which is today a unesco-declared World Heritage Site
 isko 20 hindu mandiron ko todakar banaaya gaya he
 The construction of Qutub Minar was carried forward and completed by Iltutmish
 gulam vansh ke shashan ke dauraan bahut se afgaan or faras ke amiron ne bharat main sharan lee or bas gaye
 The first ruler of this dynasty was Jalaluddin Khilji
 usne 1290 isvi main gulam vansh ke antim shaasha kaikubad kii hatya kar satta praapt kii
 He killed Kaikubad at the behest of the Turks, Afghans, and Persians
 jilaluddin khilji mul rup se afgaan-turk mul kaa tha
 He ruled for 6 years
 uski hatya uske bhattije or damaad june khan ne kar di
 Juna Khan was later known as Alauddin Khilji
 allaudin khilji ne apane sainya abhiyaan kaa armbh kaara jaagir ke soobedaar ke rup main kii, jahaan se usne malwa or devgiri par chapa maaraa or baari lutpaat kii
 After gaining his power, he also carried out his military operations in South India
 usne gujarat, malwa, ranthambor or chittod ko apane rajya main shaamil kar liya
 The celebration of his victory lasted a short time as the Mongols started a series of plunder from the northwestern border
 mongolon luutmaar ke pashchaat waapas laut gaye or chaape maarane bhi band kar die
 After the Mongols returned, Alauddin, with the help of his commander Malik Kafur and Khusron Khan, started expanding the empire towards South India and collected huge amounts of loot
 uske senapatiyon ne lut ke saamaan ekatra kiye or us par ghanima chukaaya, jisase khilji samrajya ko majbootee mili
 Among these loots, he also found the largest diamond Kohinoor in human history so far in Warangal loot
 allaudin ne kar pranali main badlaav kiye, usne anaaj or krishi utpaadon par krishi kar 20% se badhaakar 50% kar diya
 Eliminated brokerage on taxes collected by local officer
 usne aadhikariyon, kaviyon or vidwaanon ke vetan bhi kaatane shuru kar die
 This tax policy of his filled the treasury, which he used to strengthen his army
 usne sabhi krishi utpaadon or maal kii keemton ke nirdhaaran ke liye ek yojana bhi pesh kii
 He also had control over which goods to sell and which not
 usne sahana-e-mandi naam se kai mandiyaan bhi banavaai
 Muslim traders were given special permits of this mandi and they also had a monopoly on these mandis
 jo in mandiyon main tanaav failaate the unhen maance kaatane jaisi kadi sajaa milti thi
 The tax levied on crops went directly to the treasury
 iske kaaran akaal ke samay uske sainikon kii rasad main katautee nahin hoti thi
 Alauddin is also famous for brutalizing the people of his conquered kingdoms
 itihaaskaaron ne use taanashaah tak kaha he
 If Alauddin knew about the conspiracy against him, he would kill the person along with the whole family
 1298 main, uske dar ke kaaran dilli ke aasapaas ek din main 15,000 se 30,000 logon ne islam sweekaar kar liya
 After Alauddin's death in 1316, his commander Malik Kafur, who was born into a Hindu family and later accepted Islam, attempted to seize power but did not receive the support of the Afghan and Persian nobles
 malik kafoor maaraa gaya
 The last ruler of the Khilji dynasty was Qutubuddin Mubarak Shah, the 18-year-old son of Alauddin
 usne 4 varsh tak shashan kiya or khusron shah dwaara maaraa gaya
 The rule of Khusron Shah came to an end in a few months, when Ghazi Malik, later called Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, assassinated and crowned him in 1320 AD and thus the end of the Khilji dynasty was the beginning of the Tughlaq dynasty
 tughlaq vansh ne dilli par 1320 se 1414 tak raaj kiya
 Ghazi Malik, the first ruler of the Tughlaq dynasty who introduced himself as Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq
 vah mul rup turk-bhartiya tha, jiske pita turk or maa hindu thi
 Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq ruled for five years and established a new city Tughlakabad near Delhi
 kuch itihaaskaaron jaise vincent smith ke anusaar, vah apane putr june khan dwaara maaraa gaya, jisane 1325 isvi main dilli kii gaddi praapt kii
 Juna Khan introduced himself to Muhammad bin Tughluq and ruled Delhi for 26 years
 uske shashan ke dauraan dilli sultanate kaa sabase adhik bhugolic kshetrafal rahaa, jisame lagbhag puraa bhartiya upmahadweep shaamil tha
 Muhammad bin Tughluq was a scholar and had extensive knowledge of Quran, Fic, poems and other areas of the Quran
 vah apne naate-rishtedaaron, wajiron par hameshaa andeh karata tha, apane har shatru ko gambhirtha se letaa tha tathaa kai aise nirnay liye jisase aarthik kshetra main uthal-puthal ho gaya
 For example, he ordered copper coins to be replaced in place of silver coins
 yah nirnay asafal sabit hua kyoki logon ne apane gharon main jaali sikkon ko dhaalnaa shuru kar diya or usase apana jajia kar chukaane lage
 In another decision, he shifted his capital from Delhi to Devgiri in Maharashtra and forced the people of Delhi to move to Daulatabad
 jo sthanantarit hue unki maarg main hi mrityu ho gai
 The decision to shift the capital proved to be wrong as Daulatabad was a dry place due to which there was very little drinking water available according to the population there
 rajdhani ko phir se dilli sthanantarit kiya gaya
 Nevertheless, due to this order of Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Muslims of Delhi who came in large numbers did not return to Delhi
 muslimon ke dilli chhodkar dakkan jane ke kaaran bharat ke madhya or dakshini bhaagon main muslim jansankhya kaaphi bad gai
 Many Hindu and Jain temples of the Deccan region were broken, or desecrated, because of Muhammad bin Tughluq's decision; For example Swayambhu Shiva Temple and Thousand Pillar Temple
 mohammad bin tughlaq ke khilaaf 1327 isvi se vidroh prarambh ho gaye
 This continued continuously, causing the geographical area of his sultanate to shrink
 dakshin main vijaynagar samrajya kaa udai hua jo ki dilli sultanate dwaara hone vaale akramanon kaa majbootee se pratikaar karne laga
 In 1337, Muhammad bin Tughluq ordered an invasion of China and ordered his forces to pass through the Himalayan Mountains
 is yatra main kuch hi sainik jivit batch paae
 Those who survived came back unsuccessfully
 uske raaj main 1329-32 ke dauraan, uske dwaara tambe ke sikke chalaae jane ke nirnay ke kaaran rajasav ko baari kshati hui
 He raised taxes heavily to compensate for this loss
 1338 main, uske apane bhattije ne malwa main baghawat kar di, jis par usne hamalaa kiya or uski khaal utaar di
 From 1339, Muslim subedars in the eastern parts and Hindu kings from the southern parts raised the flag of revolt and declared themselves independent from the Delhi Sultanate
 mohammad bin tughlaq ke paas in bagawaton se nipatane ke liye aavashyak sansaadhan nahin the, jisase uskaa samrajya sikudta gaya
 Historian Walford has written that during Muhammad bin Tughlaq's rule, India suffered the most famines when it tested copper coins
 1347 main, bahamani samrajya sultanate se swatantra ho gaya or sultanate ke mukaable dakshin asia main ek nayaa muslim samrajya ban gaya
 Muhammad bin Tughluq died in 1351 during the capture of the people of Gujarat who had rebelled against the Delhi Sultanate
 uskaa uttaradhikari firoz shah tughlaq tha, jisane apane samrajya kii puraani kshetra ko paane ke liye 1359 main bengal ke khilaaf 11 mahine kaa yuddh armbh kiya
 But still Bengal could not join the Delhi Sultanate
