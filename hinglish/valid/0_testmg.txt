 Rennet obtained from animals is also a fermentation
 ye sharir main hone vaali jaivik kriyaaon ke utprerak hone ke saath hi aavashyak abhikriyaaon ke liye sharir main vibhinn prakaar ke protein kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Their role is so important that they either initiate the chemical reactions of the body or increase their speed
 inkaa utpreran kaa gun ek chakree prakriya he
 Like all catalysts, fermentation also acts to reduce the catalytic energy of the reaction, resulting in an increase in the reaction speed
 adhikansh prakinwan abhikriyaayein anya gaiyr-utprerit abhikriyaaon kii tulana main lakhon guna tej gati se hoti hai
 Similarly, like all other catalytic reactions, fermentation does not consume in the reaction, nor does the reaction change the equilibrium
 phir bhi prakinv anya adhikan utprerakon se is baat main alag hote hai, ki prakinv kisi vishesh abhikriya ke liye vishisht hote hai
 More than 4000 known biochemical reactions are carried out by bacteria

 There are generally three types of reactions with substrates
 sabstrate kaa anukulan tab hota he, jab prakinv sabstrate anuon ke saath kriya kar unke saath rasinic sambandh banaate hai
 In this, the fermentation reacts with the substrate and breaks down its molecules
 sabstrate ke saath kriya kar enzim usamen rasinic parivartan karata he or anuon ke electron kii sthiti main parivartan kar detaa he
 Due to this, the molecules are able to form relationships with the remaining molecules
 prakinv jab sabstrate ke sampark main aate hai to un par gadde ban jate hai
 Substrates react chemically with these pits and come into chemical form when exposed to fermentation
 is kriya ke puure hone par ve us utpaada ko mukt kar dete hai or duusare sabstrate ke saath kriya ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 In this way, the fermentation is never destroyed, but they are frequently involved in the cyclic process

 Solar clock was used to know the time from the direction of the sun

 Nevertheless, they were first used to know the time in the world

 Solar clocks have been used in India since ancient Vedic times
 surya siddhant main saura ghadi dwaara samay maapan ke shuddh tareeke adhyay 3 or 13 main varnit hai
 Early solar clocks worked only in the morning and afternoon
 in ghadiyon kii nirmaan vidhi main ek bade stambh ko ek sire se baandhakar jameen main gaad diya jaataa tha or surya ke ghoomane ke saath-saath jameen par padi stambh kii chaaya se samay kaa anumaan lagaaya jaataa tha
 The shadow of the pillar was the smallest during the mid-day, which showed that the sun is located in the middle of the sky
 pashchimi asia or misr kii sabhyataaon main aisi ghadiyon kaa bahut prayog kiya jaataa tha
 The inventors then produced more types of watches that allowed the time of day to be divided into several strikes, however, the hours were somewhat longer than today
 kai sabhyataaon main rituon ke anusaar saura ghadiyaan samay bataane lagi or kai sthanon par to ve din or raat kii baraabar lambaaiyon jaise durlabh dinon kaa bhi gyaan karaati thim
 Many cultures also have human solar clocks in which a person stands in a fixed place and finds the time from the changing shape of his shadow
 saura ghadiyon ke sahi kaam karne ke liye yah aavashyak hota tha ki unhen sahi sthanon par sthapit kiya jaae
 The sun was in different directions at different times in different places of the world, so clocks had to be set according to the direction of the sun
 iskaa ek tarika yah he ki saura ghadi ko is tarah sthapit kiya jaae ki surya ke thik akaash ke bich main hone par parchaai bilkul sidhi dikhe

 a country's foreign policy, also called the policy of foreign relations, is a set of self-styled strategies chosen by the state to protect its national interests and to achieve its goals in an environment of international relations
 kisi desh kii videsh niti duusare deshon ke saath aarthik, rajnatik, saamaajik tathaa sainik vishyon par paalan kii jane vaali nitiyon kaa ek samucchy he
 Due to the increasing level of globalization and increasing international activity, states will now have to interact with non-state actors
 kisi bhi desh kii videsh niti mukhya rup se kuch siddhanton, hiton evam uddeshyon kaa samooh hota he jinke madhyam se vah rajya duusare rashtron ke saath sambandh sthapit karke un siddhanton kii purti hetu karyrat rahata he
 Similarly, each state has its own foreign policy through which they represent their relations at the international level
 vishesh rup se sarvapratham modelski ne isko paribhaashit karte hue kaha tha ki videsh niti samudaayon dwaara viksit un kriyaaon kii vyavastha he jiske dwaara ek rajya duusare rajyon ke vyavhaar ko badalane tathaa unki gatividhiyon ko anterrashtriya vaataavaran main dhaalane kii koshish karata he
 But this type of definition of foreign policy will be considered as over simplification because the objective of foreign policy cannot be merely change of behavior of others
 apitu iske madhyam se duusare rajyon kii gatividhiyon kaa niyantran karnaa bhi ati aavashyak hota he
 Thus, along with changes in foreign policy, there is a need for continuity at times
 kyonki videshi niti parivartan evam yathasthiti donon prakaar kii nitiyon kaa samanvay hota he
 Rather, Felimus Grass goes a step further when he says that sometimes there is no relation with any state or no definite policy about it is also called foreign policy
 is prakaar videsh niti ke sakaaratmak evam nakaaratmak donon pahalu hote he
 It occurs positively when it attempts to treat other states and negatively when it tries to change the behavior of other states
 atah videsh niti un siddhanton, hito va uddeshyon ke prati vachanabaddhata he jinke dwaara ek rajya duusare rajyon ke saath antarrashtriya sandarbh main apane sambandhon kaa nirvaah karata he
 In this context, along with deciding on foreign policy, it also becomes very important to carry out relations with other states
 lekin is prakaar ke vyavhaar ke samay rajya ko apane laabh-haani arthath sansaadhan evam jokhim donon kaa moolyankan bhi kar lenaa chahie

 In the 2008 Asia Cup, Jamshed once again scored two consecutive half-centuries, including 53 runs against India and the second half-century against Bangladesh at the National Cricket Ground, Karachi, scoring 52 not out
 apane achche pradarshan ke kaaran ye sabase achche pakistan cricket team ke openar jane lage
 However, Jamshed's fitness was questioned in the 2008 Asia Cup due to which he had to stay away from some upcoming twenty-twenty matches as well as could not play in the 3 odis which were to be played against the West Indies cricket team
 nasir jamshed ne apane ekadivasiy antarrashtriya cricket kaa pehla shatak 18 march 2012 ko 2012 asia cap ke dauraan bhartiya cricket team ke khilaaf bangladesh ke sher-e-bangla rashtriya cricket stadium ,mirpur main banaaya tha

 gramophone dhwani utpann karanevaala ek yantra he, jo ek sooyee ke dolanon ko vaayu main sanchaarit kar dhwani utpann karata he
 The needle is in contact with a curved groove made in a rotating record
 gramophonunani bhashaa main "graamo" kaa arth he akshar or "phone" kaa arth he dhwani
 In the broadest sense, any such instrument is called a gramophone, which allows the recording and subsequent reproduction of sound
 sarvapratham lian scot ne san 1857 main ek aise yantra, phonatograph, kaa avishkaar kiya jiske dwaara dhwani kaa abhilekhan kiya ja saktaa tha
 The phonatograph contained a membrane to which a very delicate protrusion was attached
 jhilli ek paravaleey keep ke patale sire par tani hoti thi
 The tip of the lever was brought on a cylinder on which a paper was wrapped and soot was put on the paper
 belan ek bahut sookshm pench se laga hota tha, jo belan ke ghoomane par kshaitij disha main chalata tha
 When there was a sound on the membrane and the cylinder was rotated, a spiral line formed on the black surface of the marker paper
 is prakaar dhwani kaa abhilekhan kar liya jaataa tha
 The first real reproduction of recorded sound was T
A
 It was possible in 1876 by Edison
 adisson ne apane yantra ko phonograph naam diya
 It had a brass cylinder, on which a spiral line was drawn
 belan se ek kshaitij pench laga hota tha
 a parchment membrane was made at the mouth of a small cylinder of brass about 2 inches in diameter
 jhilli ke centre se ek ispaat kii sooyee sanlagn hoti thi jisaki nok chhenidaar hoti thi
 a rigid steel spring was placed near the tip of the needle
 kamaani kaa doosraa sira pital ke belan se judaa hota tha
 The recorder was placed on a large cylinder in such a way that the thin edge of the needle moved between the spiral grooves when the cylinder rotated
 belan par tin kii panni kii ek parat hoti tha
 When the membrane was vibrated by the sound entering the small cylinder, various depths were excavated by the marker on the foil at the bottom of the groove due to the variation of the pressures of the oscillations
 yah khudaai dhwani tarangon ke anuroop hoti thi
 a second marker was placed on the slot to reproduce the sound
 chinhak khudaai kaa anusaran karata hua kram se upar yaa neeche jaataa tha or is tarah vah jhilli ko, jis prakaar vah abhilekhan ke samay compit kii gai thi usee prakaar, compit hone ke liye baadhya karata tha
 The vibrations of the membrane vibrated the air and thus reproduced the precession
 aage chalakar isamen bahut se sudhaar kiye gaye

 Sound recording was done in the tenter's gramophone, not by digging up and down on the record, but by cutting
 dhwani punarutpaadan vidyut-jamaav-prakriya dwaara kiya gaya
 Machines using cylindrical records like phonographs were not popular for many days, but they had many errors
 in trutiyon main se kuch ko durkar amyle berlinner ne san 1887 main ek yantra banaaya, jise gramophone naam diya
 The first sketch of his patent description contained a cylindrical record, in the form of a paper painted with mascara
 yah kaagaj ek dhol par lipta tha
 The cutting needle used to move in a horizontal direction and remove the mascara and make a spiral line
 punarutpaadan ke liye usne ricard kii nakal yantric dhang se, khudaai yaa kataai kar pratirodhi padaarth par kii
 He made a permanent record of copper, nickel, or any other metal that had a deep spiral line
 abhilikhit dhwani ko utpann karne ke liye ricard ek drum par lapeta jaataa tha or sooyee kii nok khaanch main rakhi jaati thi tathaa drum ko ghumaya jaataa tha
 In Berliner's second and modified gramophone, a flat plaque was used for the record
 kaanch kii ek pattica par syaahi, yaa rang kii ek parat jamaa dete the
 The needle on it drew a spiral line from edge to center, or from center to edge
 ek mej par ricard pattica ko rakhkar mej ko kisi upyukt prakaar se ghumaya jaataa tha
 The plaque was coated with a material that had little resistance to the motion of the needle and was not affected by acids
 benzin main ghule hue madhumakhi ke mom ko usne upyukt paaya
 When the needle formed a blanket on the record and the concrete on its bottom was left open, then acid was dug and a permanent record was made
 kade rabar yaa anya padaarthon kii patticoon ko dabaakar ricard kii pratilipiyaan praapt kii jaati thim
 The construction of Pattikanuma records was successful in commercial terms in 1897
 gayakon ko bhompu ke mukh ke thik saamne rakhaa jaataa tha taaki dhwani kii urja tanupat par kendrit ho sake
 Singers or instrumentalists used to sit
 ek parade ke aage bhompu baahar kii ore niklaa hota tha
 On the other side of the screen was a recording machine, which contained a plaque of wax-like material
 isi pattica par sooyee sarpil rekha ankit karti thi
 a precipitate of solid metal was made from this fillet by the process of electrical deposition
 ek aise padaarth par jo saadhaarant: kadaa hota he, parantu garam karne par mulaayam ho, jaataa he, is pratichhaap ko dabaakar uski pratilipiyaan banaai jaati thim
 Around this time, many inventors paid attention to the improvement of reproducible machines
 landan ke vigyaansangrahalay main pradarshit bahut se gramophonon dwaara unke vikaas kii vibhinn avasthaaon kii jhalak milti he
 In the beginning is Berliner's machine, which consists of a metal resonant resonant box
 yah haath se chalaai jaati thi
 Mechanical control entered in 1896 and by the turn of the century a clock-like device was made, used only for reproduction
 isamen selulide kaa tanupat tha, parantu do saal pashchaat abhrak kaa upyog hone laga
 By 1905, such a resonance had developed which remained in vogue for 20 years without significant changes
 isamen abhrak kaa tanupat tha, jo chaaron taraf kinare par rabar ke khokhale challe rupi gasket se acchhee tarah ksaa rahata tha
 The lever which pulled the center of the tip of the tip with the tip of the needle, had an inclination of acicor and its motion was controlled by gentle bowers
 achche punarutpaadan ke liye bade horn aavashyak the, parantu jab inkaa bhaar bahut adhik hone laga tab unhen anunadpetica se alag kar diya gaya or mashin kii peti par bane ek bracket se joda jane laga
 a small tube was used to connect the resonance band with Bhopu, which was called Soundbhuja
 bhompu kaa dikhaai dena janata pasand nahin karti thi, isaliye use ulataa karke peti main rakhaa gaya
 The speaker or singer speaks or sings in front of the sound
 dhvaniposh main utpann parivarti vidyuddhara ko radio vaalvon dwaara sambandhit kar ek kundali main le jate hai
 As the electronegativity decreases, the soft iron armature oscillates in the lateral direction and the attached sapphire needle creates a spiral groove on the wax plate
 vidyudvidhi se dhwani utpaadan karne ke liye anunadpetica kii jagah vidyuddhvanigrah kaa upyog karte hai
 The lateral motion of the needle generates variable current in a coil, which is then carried to the loudspeaker
 bahut se dhwanigrah manibh kaa upyog karte hai or bahuton main ghoomanevaala ghaatr hota he yaa kundali
 Some sonographs also use electrotherapy
 1926 i
 tak tawen kaa vyas 10-12 inch hota tha or ve ek minute main 78 yaa 80 baar ghoomte the
 They used to last four minutes, but now such improvements have been made that the song can be heard from the same pan for half an hour
 ye tave ek minute main 33 baar ghoomte hai
 It has also been arranged that the pan keeps changing on its own
 san 1935 se pehle praaia: ispaat kii suiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha, ek hi tave par chalane ke baad unhen badalanaa aavashyak ho jaataa tha, parantu aajkal neelam kii suiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Harrison created a lateral recorder in 1925 based on the similarity of the electrical and mechanical communities
 doosraa mahatvapurn charan tha urdhwadhar abhilekhan ke liye punarjanan abhilekhak kaa nirmaan
 By 1947 the regeneration recorder was also used for lateral recording
 isse yah laabh hua ki sooyee par pattica kii abhikriya se jo vikruti utpann hoti thi vah kam ho gai

 Poet and Acharya Bhikharidas was born in 1721 AD in a place called Tenuga near Pratapgarh
 inaki mrityu bihar main aara ke nikat bhabhua naamak sthaan par hui
 The seven works written by Bhikharidas are considered authentic - Rasa summary, poetic judgment, Shringar decision, Chhandornav Pingal, Amarkosh or Shabnam Prakash, Vishnu Purana language and Satta Raksha

 laaj ko anchai kai, kuldharam pachai kai, vruthabandhan sanchai kai bhai magan gopal main In 'poetry poetry', Bhikhari Das ji has written Babu Hindupati Singh, brother of Somvanshi King Prithvi Singh of Pratapgarh as his refuge
 raja prithvipati samvath 1791 main gaddi par baithe the or 1807 main dilli ke vazeer safadarajang dwaara chal se maare gaye the
 It seems that after Samvat 1807, he did not write any book, so his poetry can be considered from Samvat 1785 to Samvat 1807
 kavyangon ke nirupan main bhikhaari das ko sarvapradhan sthaan diya jaataa he kyonki inhone chand, ras, alankaar, reeti, gun, dosha shabdashakti aadi sab vishyon kaa auron se vistrut pratipaadan kiya he
 His subject rendering style is excellent and criticality is also found in him; For example, in the Hindi poetry field, he saw the abundance of love of Parakiya, which comes under the sight of rasa
 bahut se sthalon par to radhakrishna kaa naam aane se devkavy kaa aarope ho jaataa he or dosha kaa kuch parihaar ho jaataa he, par sarvatra aisa nahin hota
 By this, the beggar Das wanted to make the symptoms of Swakiya a little more widespread and said, dev kii bhanti bhikhaari das kaa sthaan he
 Although the beggar Das has done more work in this area than others, he has not even got the full form of the true teacher
 paristhiti se ye bhi laachaar the
 Their symptoms are also inadequate without interpretation and sometimes misleading and examples are also impure at some places
 jaise - upadan lakshana, iskaa lakshan bhi ashuddh he or usee ke anuroop udhaaharan bhi ashuddh he
 Therefore, beggar slaves also come before us as poets, like others
 bhikhaari das ne saahitiyik or parimarjeet bhashaa kaa vyavhaar kiya he
 Make up was the main theme of that time
 dev ne bhinn bhinn deshon or jatiyon kii striyon ke varnan ke liye 'jativilas' likhaa, jisamen nine, dhobin, sab hai, par bhikhaari das ne rasabhaav yaa maryaada kaa dhyaan rakh inako alamban ke rup main na rakhkar duti ke rup main rakhaa he
 His 'rasasansh' has all kinds of messengers such as Nine, Natini, Dhobin, Kumharin, Barine
 bhikhaari das main dev kii apeksha adhik rasvivek tha
 His 'shringarirnayanay' is a unique poem in its own way
 udhaaharan manohar or saras he
 The language does not contain rhetoric
 na ye shabd chamatkaar par toote hai, na dur kii sujh ke liye vyakul hue hai
 His composition is Sanyat in Kalapaksha and Ranjankarini in Bhavapaksha
 vishuddh kavy ke atirikt inhone niti kii sukhtiyaan bhi bahut si kahi hai jinamein ukti vaichitraya apekshit hota he
 Just like Dev's high aspiration or imagination is found in them, similarly his failure is not found anywhere
 jis baat ko ye jis dhang se, chaahe vah dhang bahut vilakshan na ho, kahana chaahate the us baat ko us dhang se kehane kii puri samarthy inamen thi
 There is no rest, no vanity, nor dryness

 Earthquakes are measured with seismometers, also called seismographs
 ek bukamp kaa aghurna pariman mapkram paaramparik rup se napa jaataa he, yaa sambandhit or aprachlit richter pariman liya jaataa he
 An earthquake of magnitude 3 or less Richter is often imperceptible, while an earthquake of magnitude 7 Richter causes severe damage in large areas
 jhatkon kii tivrata kaa maapan viksit markaili paimaane par kiya jaataa he
 On the surface of the Earth, an earthquake manifests itself by moving or displacing the land
 jab ek bada bukamp uparicendre apatati sthati main hota he, yah samudr ke kinare par paryaapt maatra main visthaapan kaa kaaran banataa he, jo sunami kaa kaaran he
 Earthquake tremors can sometimes cause landslides and volcanic activities
 sarvaadhik saamaanya arth main, kisi bhi sismik ghatana kaa varnan karne ke liye bukamp shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, ek prakritik ghatana]) yaa manushyon ke kaaran hui koi ghatana -jo sismik tarangon ) ko utpann karti he
 Earthquakes are often caused by geological faults, large amounts of gas migration, mainly methane deep within the earth, volcanoes, landslides and nuclear tests are the main faults
 bukamp ke utpann hone kaa praarambhik bindu kendra yaa hipo centre kehalaata he
 The word epicenter means the point just above the ground level
 ke maamle main, bahut se bukamp plate seemaa se dur utpann hote hai or virupan ke vyapak kshetra main viksit tanaav se sambandhit hote hai, yah virupan dosha kshetra main pramukh aniyamittaaon ke kaaran hote hai
 The Northridge earthquake was related to blind pressure movements in one such area
 ek anya udhaaharan he arab or urasian plate ke bich tiryak abhikendrit plate seemaa jahaan yah zagros pahaado ke pashchimottar hisse se hokar jaati he
 The deformation associated with this plate boundary is divided into a nearly pure pressure motion perpendicular to a large west – south boundary and an almost pure streak-slip motion occurring along the edge of a recent main fault near the actual plate boundary
 iskaa pradarshan bukamp kii kendriya kriyavidhi ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 All tectonic plates have internal pressure fields due to interactions with their neighboring plates or due to sediment loading or unloading
 
ye tanaav upasthit dosha satahon ke kinare vifaltaa kaa paryaapt kaaran ho sakate hai, ye antamplate bukamp ko janm dete hai
 Most tectonic earthquakes do not occur at depths greater than 10 kilometers
 70 kilometre se kam kii gaharaai par utpann hone vaale bukamp 'chhichley-kendra' ke bukamp kehalaate hai, jabaki 70-300 kilometre ke bich kii gaharaai se utpann hone vaale bukamp 'madhya -kendriya' yaa 'antar madhya-kendriya' bukamp kehalaate hai
 In the low-lying area where the older and colder oceanic layer slips beneath the other tectonic plate, deeper concentrated earthquakes can occur at greater depths
 sismik rup se subduction ke ye sakriya kshetra Wadati - Benioff kshetra sa kehalaate hai
 Deep center earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted lithosphere should not become brittle due to high temperatures and pressures
one possible mechanism for the earthquake to occur in the gahare kendra ke bukamp ke utpann hone ke liye ek sambhavit kriyavidhi he oliwine ke kaaran utpann dosha jo spinel sanrachana main ek avasthaa sankraman ke dor hota he
 Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions as well, for two reasons there are tectonic faults and lava movements in volcanoes
 Such earthquakes can be an early warning of volcanic eruptions
 ek kram main hone vaale adhikansh bukamp, sthaan or samay ke sandarbh main ek duusare se sambandhit ho sakate hai
 If there is no such shock that can be clearly called the main shock, then the sequence of these tremors is called earthquake swarm
 kai baar bhukampon kii ek shrinkhla bukamp toofaan ke rup main utpann hoti he, jahaan bukamp samooh main dosha utpann karata he, prayek jatke main purv jatke ke tanaav kaa punarvitaran hota he
 It is similar to the latter shock but is the trailing part of the fault, these storms occur over a period of several years and many subsequent earthquakes are as damaging as the earlier ones
 This type of pattern was seen in Turkey in the 20th century, where a sequence of about a dozen earthquakes struck the North Anatolian fault, which are considered to be large clusters of earthquakes in the Middle East

 The following different theories have been formulated on the causes of earthquakes: pratyasth pratikshep siddhant - san 1906 main harry fielding read ne is siddhant ko pratipaadit kiya tha
 This theory came to light after a thorough study and survey of the San Francisco earthquake
 is siddhant ke anusaar bhuparpati par neeche se koi bal lambii avadhi tak kaary kare, to vah ek nishchat samay tathaa bindu tak us bal ko sahegi or uske pashchaat chattaanon main vikruti utpann ho jaaegi
