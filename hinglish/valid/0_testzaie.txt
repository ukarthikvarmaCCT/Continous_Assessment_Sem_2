 The Bengal Land Commission also came to the conclusion that 'permanent settlement of 1793 AD, for whatever reasons was deemed appropriate at that time, is unsuitable in today's situation and has created so many evils in the zamindari system that it is no longer in the interest of the nation Even the type is no longer useful
 ’ bhartiya tathaa paashchaatya arthvettaon kii raay main jameendaari unmoolan adhik krishi utpaadan ke liye atyaavashyak he

 suprasiddh sahitya darpan main kaha gaya he hriday kaa sthaayee bhav, jab vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav kaa sanyog praapt kar letaa he to ras rup main nishpann ho jaataa he
 Dev, the chief poet of Reetikal, has defined rasa in these words: is prakaar ras ke chaar ang hai - sthaayee bhav, vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav
 Bhava means: -hona sahruday ke ant:karan main jo manovikar vaasana yaa sanskaar rup main sadaa vidyaman rahete hai tathaa jinhen koi bhi virdohi yaa avirohi dabaa nahin saktaa, unhen sthaayee bhav kehete hai
 They reside in the human mind in seed form, stagnant for a long time
 ye sanskaar yaa bhaavana ke dyotak hai
 They are hidden in humans in the same way as the smell in the soil is absorbed in a different way
 ye itane samarth hote hai ki anya bhaavon ko apane main villin kar lete hai
 Their number is 11 - Rati, Haas, mourning, ecstasy, anger, fear, jugupsa, amazement, Nirveda, Vatsalata and love for God
 vibhaav kaa arth he kaaran
 They affect / express the permanent expressions, making them tasty
 ye ras kii utpatti main aadharbhoot maane jate hai
 There are two differences of influence: bhaavon kaa udgam jis mukhya bhav yaa vastu ke kaaran ho vah kavy kaa alamban kaha jaataa he
 Subjects and shelter come under suspension
 jis paatr ke prati kisi paatr ke bhav jaagrit hote hai vah vishay he
 In literature, this topic is called Alamban Vibhava or 'alamban'
 jis paatr main bhav jaagrit hote hai vah aashray kehalaata he
 The causal factor in keeping the permanent feeling awake is called stimulation effect
 udhaaharan swaroop vir ras ke sthaayee bhav utsaah ke liye saamne khadaa hua shatru alamban vibhaav he
 The army with the enemy, the instruments of war and the enemy's robes, roar-lines, arms operations, etc
 are the stimulus effects
 uddipan vibhaav ke do prakaar maane gayi hai: Meaning the powers and gestures of standing arthath vaataavaran se sambandhit vasteen
 Natural scenes are also counted under these
 rati, haas, shok aadi sthaayee bhaavon ko prakashit yaa vyakt karne vaali aashray kii cheshtaaen anubhav kehalaati hai
 These gestures originate in the shelter after emotional awakening, hence they are called Anubhav, that is, one who follows the emotion is called Anubhav
 anubhav ke do bhed hai - icchit or anichhit
 The actions which occur in the ordinary folk publishing the emotions, generated by their own causes through dedication and stimulation, are called poetic dramas etc
 udhaaharan swaroop virah-vyakul nayak dwaara sisakiyaan bharna, milan ke bhaavon main ashru, swead, romaanch, anuraag sahit dekhnaa, krodh jaagrit hone par shastr sanchaalan, kathor vaani, ankhon kaa laal ho janaa aadi anubhav kahe jaaenge
 Simple experience: There are four distinctions
 1
angik 2
vaachik 3
 aharya 4
 satvik
 The physiological efforts of the asylum are asexual or somatic
 rati bhav ke jaagrath hone par bhu-vikshep, kataaksh aadi praytn purvak kiye gayi vagvyapaar vaachik anubhav hai
 Superimposed or artificial dress design is dietary experience
 parantu, sthaayee bhav ke jaagrath hone par swaabhaavik, akrutrim, aytnaj, angavikar ko satvik anubhav kehete hai
 For this, the shelter does not have to make any external efforts
 isliye ye aytnaj kahe jate hai
 They are self-generating and cannot be stopped
 satvik anubhav : arthath aath bhed hai - stambh, swead, romaanch, swarbhang, vepathu, vaivarny, ashru or pralay
 Those expressions which come in a helpful form only to confirm the permanent feeling for a short time and immediately disappear, are communicable
 sanchari shabd kaa arth he, saath-saath chalanaa arthath sancharanshil hona, sanchari bhav sthaayee bhav ke saath sancharit hote hai, inamen itnaa sarmathy hota he ki ye prayek sthaayee bhav ke saath uske anukool banakar chal sakate hai
 Therefore they are also called adulterous expressions
 sanchari yaa vyabhichaari bhaavon kii sankhya 33 maani gayi he - nirved, glani, shankaa, asuya, mad, shram, aalasy, deenta, chintaa, moh, smriti, dhruthi, vrida, chapalya, harsh, aaveg, jadta, garv, vishaad, autsukya, nidra, apsmaar, swapn, prabodh, amarsh, avhittha, ugrata, mati, vyaadhi, unmaad, maran, traas or vitark
 Bharatamuni, while revealing rasa as an essential element of poetry, has clearly mentioned its eight distinctions under the names Shringar, Humor, Raudra, Karun, Veer, Kavach, Bibhatsa and Bhavya and based on certain lines, scholars imagine that He has also approved the ninth juice called Shanta
 inhen nau rason kii sangya he navras
 These juices result from the coincidence of vibrancy-communicable
 prayek ras kaa sthayibhav alag-alag nishchit he
 The Nirvighna-prati-adhyabha stage which is fulfilled by its Vibhavadi coincidence is called Rasa
 shringaar kaa sthaayee rati, hasya kaa haas, raudra kaa krodh, karun kaa shok, vir kaa utsaah, adbhut kaa vismay, bibhats kaa jugupsa, bhayanak kaa bhay tathaa shant kaa sthaayee sham yaa nirved kehalaata he
 Bharata has considered Vishnu, Pramatha, Rudra, Yamraj, Indra, Brahma, Mahakal and Kaldev, the deities of the eight Rasas respectively
 shant ras ke devtaa narayan or uskaa varna kundetu bataaya jaataa he
 The first eight rasas are considered as Shyam, Sit, Rakht, Kapot, Gaur, Peet, Neel and Krishna Varna respectively
 bharat ne pratham aath rason main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats ko pradhan maanakar kramash: hasya, karun, adbhut tathaa bhayanak ras kii utpatti maani he
 The humor of Shringar arises as a result of humor, raudra and heroic deeds resulting from compassion and the amazing and gruesome philosophy
 anukriti kaa arth, abhinavgupt ke shabdon main abhas he, at: kisi bhi ras kaa abhas hasya kaa utpaadak ho saktaa he
 Deformed prostitutes are also funny
 raudra kaa kaary vinaash hota he, at: usase karun kii tathaa virkarm kaa karta praaia: ashakya kaaryon ko bhi karte dekha jaataa he, at: usase adbhut kii utpatti swaabhaavik lagati he
 Similarly, the origin of the terrible is also possible from Bibhatsadarshan
 akele smashanadi kaa darshan bhayotpadak hota he
 However, this genesis theory cannot be said to be absolute, because the raksha or heroic rasa of the altar can also create the terrible for the spontaneous, and the origin of calm is also possible from the horrors
 raudra se bhayanak, shringaar se adbhut or vir tathaa bhayanak se karun kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 In fact the opinion of Bharata is not clear
 unke pashchaat dhananjay ne chitt kii vikaas, vistaar, vikshobh tathaa vikshep naamak chaar avasthaaen maanakar shringaar tathaa hasya ko vikaas, vir tathaa adbhut ko vistaar, bibhats tathaa bhayanak ko vikshobh or raudra tathaa karun ko vikshepavastha se sambandhit mana he
 But the scholars who believe only three states, called Druti, Vistara and Vikas, will not be solved by this classification
 isi prakaar yadi shringaar main chitt kii dravit sthiti, hasya tathaa adbhut main uskaa vistaar, vir tathaa raudra main uski dipti tathaa bibhats or bhayanak main uskaa sankoch maan len to bhi bharat kaa kram thik nahin baithta
 The presence of one situation with another is also not impossible
 adbhut or vir main vistaar ke saath dipti tathaa karun main druti or sankoch donon hai
 Nevertheless, there is so much indication from the establishment of a Bharathakrita relation that there is mutual reciprocity in the said rasas and they are friends and associates of each other
 mitrataa ke samaan hi in rason kii prayogsthiti ke anusaar inke virodh kii kalpana bhi kii gai he
 Which other juices, along with which other juices will be immediately hindered in taste, this opposition is based on this idea
 karun, bibhats, raudra, vir or bhayanak se shringaar kaa; bhayanak or karun se hasya kaa; hasya or shringaar se karun kaa; hasya, shringaar or bhayanak se raudra kaa; shringaar, vir, raudra, hasya or shaat se bhayanak kaa; bhayanak or shant se vir kaa; vir, shringaar, raudra, hasya or bhayanak se shant kaa virodh mana jaataa he
 This protest is present due to shelter, communion, communion or continuity
 prabandh kavy main hi is virodh kii sambhaavna rahati he
 In Muktak, there is no fear of ending with the verses of the subject
 lekhak ko virdohi rason kaa aashray tathaa alambanon ko pruthak-pruthak rakhkar athwa do virdohi rason ke bich donon ke mitra ras ko upasthit karke yaa pradhan ras kii apeksha angaras kaa sancharivat upasthit karke is virodh se utpann aswaad-vyaghaat ko upasthit hone se bachaa lenaa chahie
 Considering the deliciousness of the juice, it is said to be Brahmananda sibling, Swaprakasananda, eccentric etc
 and on this basis all the juices are considered to be enjoyable
 bhattnayak ne satvodrake ke kaaran mamatv-paratv-hin dasha, abhinavgupt ne nirvighn pratiti tathaa aanandavardhan ne karun main maadhurya tathaa ardrata kii avasthit bataate hue shringaar, vipralambh tathaa karun ko uttarottar prakarshamay bataakar sabhi rason kii anandswarupata kii ore hi sanket kiya he
 But by considering the sentiments based on favorable sentimentality and unfavorable sentimentality, Rudrabhatta Ramchandra Gunachandra, Haripal, and Dhananjaya and Acharya Ramchandra Shukla in Hindi have considered the juxtaposition of the rashas and the sadistic sensations
 abhinavgupt ne in sabase pehle hi "abhinavbharti" main "sukhdu:khaswabhaavon ras:" siddhanth ko prastut kar diya tha
 In the rhetorical rasas, sringar, valor, humor, wonderful and quiet, and in sadistic karuna, raudra, bebhatas and terrible were counted
 "pankaras" kaa udhaaharan dekar jaise yah siddh kiya gaya ki gud mirich aadi ko mishrit karke banaae janevaale panak ras main alag-alag vastuon kaa khatta meethaapan na maaloom hokar ek vicitra prakaar kaa aswaad miltaa he, usee prakaar yah bhi kaha gaya ki us vaichitrya main bhi anupatik dhang se kabhi khatta, kabhi tikt or isi prakaar anya prakaar kaa swaad aa hi jaataa he
 Madhusudan Saraswati's statement is that even after considering sattva as prime, rather than raja or tam, it should be accepted that partly they also remain tasteful
 acharya shukla kaa mat he ki hamen anubhuti to varnit bhav kii hi hoti he or bhav sukhaatmak du:khaatmak aadi prakaar ke hai, atev ras bhi donon prakaar kaa hoga
 On the other hand, to treat the juices as blissful, consider it to be a pity for the biased gentlemen and take the support of the argument that even if the sorrowful object is dear, it seems to be pleasurable
 jaise, ratikeli ke samay stri kaa nakhkshatadi se yon to sharir pidaa hi anubhav hoti he, kintu us samay vah use sukh hi maanati he
 In addition to this notion of Bhoja and Vishwanath, Madhusudan Saraswati himself supports his blissfulness by considering the rasas as distinct and unique from the sensation of cosmic emotions, and Abhinavagupta explains this notion that we experience the same feeling without being distracted and If it is done without external or intrinsic interference, then it is called joyful because it is tolerable
 yadi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi kyon na mana jaae? is prakaar ke anek tark dekar rason kii aanandarupata siddh kii jaati he
 The pleasure of trajedi in English has also been resolved in many ways and Marathi writers have also presented quite different perceptions regarding the beauty of juices
 praaia: rason ke vibhinn naamon kii oupaadhik yaa aupchaarik satta maanakar parmaarthik rup main ras ko ek hi maanane kii dharna prachlit rahi he
 Bharata has used the word "rasa" in a line in the line "na Hhi Rasadruta Kashchidapyartha: Pravartat" and Abhinavagupta has expressed the above notion
 bhoj ne shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar uski sarvathaev bhinn vyakhya kii he, vishwanath kii anusaar narayan pandit chamatkaarakari adbhut ko hi ekmaatr ras maanate hai, kyonki chamatkaar hi rasaroop hota he
 Bhavabhuti considers Karun to be the only rasa and explains the origin of all from him, and on the basis of the statement of "swayam swayam nimittamasadya shantadbhava: enlightenment, re-creation of peace," - calm can be considered as the only juice
 isi prakaar utsaah tathaa vismay kii sarvarasasanchari sthiti ke aadhaar par unhen bhi anya sab rason ke mul main mana ja saktaa he
 Rasa is just a monolithic feeling in the form of taste and pleasure, it is one side and other juices have emerged from the same rasa, it is the other side
 rasapraadhanya ke vichaar main rasarajata kii samasya utpann kii he
 Bharata considers all Shuchi, Ujwal, Medhya and Dalani as adorners, "agnipuran" considers the dressing as the only rasa and distinguishes it from others, Bhoja considers the Shringar as the original and only rasa, but on the basis of the available written evidence " The use of the word "rasaraja" appears only for Bhaktiras in "ujjwalanilamani"
 hindi main keshavadas shringaar ko rasanayak or dev kavi sab rason kaa mul maanate hai
 The use of the noun "rasaraja" is used only by Matiram
 duusari ore banarsidas "samaysar" naatak main "navamon saant rasni ko nayak" kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 Acceptance of rajrajata is dependent on comprehensiveness, fervent taste, ability to penetrate other juices, the power to embody all sancharis and satvikas
 ye sabhi baaten jitani adhik or prabal shringaar main pai jaati hai, utani anya rason main nahin
 Therefore, Rasraj is called the same
 raso kaa raja shringaar ras ko mana jaataa he Thinkers have also described the remaining rasas except for Raudra and Karun
 inamen sabase vistrut varnan shringaar kaa hi thahartaa he
 Shringar is mainly divided into two parts in the name of conjugation and vipralambha or disconnection, but some scholars like Dhananjaya etc
 consider the antecedent distinction of Vipralambha as a coincidence-antagonistic-non-preceding condition and the two distinctions from the name of the rest of abuse and intercourse

 The antithesis of "poetry poetry" is new and the shapahutak distinction can only be accepted as a form of migration, "sahityadarpan" envisages the Karuna Vipralambha

 In "alankarakoustubh", the soon-to-be-destroyed and not-so-beautiful raga is called the fourth by the name "haridra", which his commentator also calls "shyamarag"

 Nayikalankar, Ritu and Prakriti are also described under Shringar Rasa

 In Hindi, Keshavdas and a few other writers have made only four distinctions namely Mandhas, Kalhas, Atihas and Parihas angreji ke aadhaar par hasya ke anya anek naam bhi prachlit ho gaye hai
 Examples - nayaa udhaaharan- There is no difference of quiet

 Examples - bharatmuni ke ‘naatyashaastra’ main pratipaadit aath natyarason main shringaar or hasya ke anantar tathaa raudra se purv karun ras kii gananaa kii gai 
 'raudratu Karuno Rasa:' Saying 'karun Rasa' has its origin from 'raudra Rasa' and its origin is Shapajyaan Clash Vinipat, ishitjan-viprayag, Vibhava Nash, Slaughter, Bandhan, Vidarva means Exodus, Abuse, Addiction ie Objection etc
 Is accepted by chance

 Examples - kavyagat rason main raudra ras kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Bharata has considered these four rasas as 'shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatas in the Natyasastra', so he has given the origin of other juices from them, namely- 'teshamutpattihetavchchatvaro Rasa: Shringaro Roudro Viro Vibhats Iti'
 raudra se karun ras kii utpatti bataate hue bharat kehete hai ki ‘raudrasyaev c yatkarm sa shey: karuno ras:’
 The deeds of raudra rasa are the father of compassion
 raudra ras kaa 'sthaayee bhav' 'krodh' he tathaa iskaa varna rakt evam devtaa rudra he
 The example of raudra rasa has already been inscribed from Keshavdas's 'ramachandrika'
 bhushan kii rachanaaon main bhi raudra ras ke udhaaharan mil jate hai
 In the present day, the compositions of Shyamnarayan Pandey and 'dinkar' have had an effective expression of raudra rasa

 Panditraj etc
 has made many other distinctions as the basis of enthusiasm
 udhaaharan - Bharatamuni of wonderful rasa has made two distinctions - Divya and Anandaj

 According to Bibhats Bharata and Dhananjaya, there are three types of pure, decaying and udvegi
 bhayanak karanbhed se vyajjanya yaa bhramajanit, aparaadhjanya yaa kaalpanik tathaa vitrasitak yaa vaastavik naam se teen prakaar kaa or swanishtha paranishth bhed se do prakaar kaa mana jaataa he
 On the basis of the similarity of a particular symptom of the permanence or of some sense of the juices, the tendency of the juices to enter into each other, to reject a permanence, to be considered as new permanent has also been shown occasionally
 yatha, shant ras or dayavir tathaa vibhats main se dayavir kaa shant main antarbhaav tathaa bibhats sthaayee jugupsa ko shant kaa sthaayee mana gaya he
 "nagananda" considers the play to be a play of calm and a play on mercy by Dayavir
 kintu yadi shant ke tatvagyanamoolak viraam or dayavir ke karunajanit utsaah par dhyaan diya jaae to donon main bhinnata dikhaai degi
 Similarly, the distraction in Jugupsa does not remain in the quiet
 shant raag-dwesh donon se pare samavastha or tatvagyansanmilit ras he jisamen jugupsa sanchari maatr ban sakati he
 Just like in Karun, there is a sense of sympathy and in Dayavir, but in Karun, there is a state of mourning and in Dayavir, there is a sympathetic self-proclaimed enthusiasm
 athwa, jaise raudra or yudhvir donon kaa alamban shatru he, at: donon main krodh kii maatra rahati he, parantu raudra main rahanevaali pramodpratikul tikshnata or avivek or yudhvir main utsah kii utfullata or vivek rahata he
 In anger, there is a sense of vengeance in hostility and in valor patience and generosity
 atev inkaa paraspar antarbhaav sambhav nahin
 Similarly, it is also not appropriate to consider "anmarsha" as permanent of Veer, because Amarsha manifests as Abhinivesh or self-respecting sense of mind due to condemnation, insult or objection, but in this kind of distinctions of Veeras called Dayavir, Danavir, and Dharmaveer The feeling does not last

 This metal is rarely found in the upper surfaces of the earth
 paaya gaya ki kai shilaon kii ke-piji seemaa main ausat se 30 guna se lekar 120 guna iridium kaa jamaavada upasthit tha
 There is no known reason for this assemblage to be born on the earth itself because iridium is an element attracted to iron, so most of its quantity went to the center of being attracted by the iron present in the core at the time of earth's construction
 lekin is se miltaa-julata iridium sankendran kai kshudragrahon main miltaa he
 Scientists estimated the amount of iridium inhabiting the K-PG range of the entire world and calculated that the asteroid that struck it to bring it to Earth must have been at least 10 km, and its strike hit 10 nil tons of TNT
 Must have exploded loudly
 tulana ke liye yah maanav dwaara kiye gayi sabase shaktishaalee hidrogen bam ke dhamaake se 20 lakh guna adhik he
 The evidence for this theory of Alvarez's comet collision also appears to be correct, given that the enormous amount of iridium found in the chondrite, meteorite, and asteroids, which is approximately ~ 455 degrees per billion, is found in the upper layers of the Earth at ~ 0
3 The share is much more than per billion

 Because of this strike, a great cloud of dust must have spread all over the world, including fine droplets of sulfur

 Diatoms are found in water and by looking at the place, different types of diatom colonies are found, so that we can easily find the crime scene
 dytome vividh prakaar ke sooksham shaiwal hai jo kii silica cell kii diwaar se bane hote hai
 Diatoms have many characteristics such as color, shape, etc
 dytome kii lagbhag 8000 jatiyaan hai

 With the flow of blood, these diatoms reach different parts of the body
 agar kisi bhi vyakti ke sharir ke vibhinn angon main dytome paae jate hai to ham kah sakate hai ki pani main doobane se pehle vyakti jivit tha
 Whereas if a person is thrown into water after death, then the presence of diatom is highest in the bones of the thigh and legs only
 dytome ke in pareekshanon kii madad se ham yah pataa laga sakate hai ki vyakti kii mrityu pani main doobane se hui he yaa phir mrit sharir ko pani main duboya gaya tha
 The time of death can also be detected by a diatom test
 jaise agar dytome pareekshan ke baad dytome kii colony kii jatiyaan 20 se kam hai to kah sakate hai ki mrityu ko kam se kam 7-12 din hue hai
 If the diatom species is more than 50, then in that case the death of the person is considered to be about 1 week

 It is the second largest sect of Islam after the Sunni sect, which constitutes only 15% of the entire Muslim population
 san 632 main hazrat mohammad kii mrityu ke pashchaat jin logon ne apni bhaavana se hazarat ali ko apana imam or calipha chunaa wo log shiyane ali kehalaae jo aaj shiya kehalaate hai
 But from Sunot, Sunni do not call them "shia" or "shiyane Ali" but "rafazi"
 is dharmik vichaardhaara ke anusaar hazarat ali, jo mohammad sahab ke chachere bhai or damaad donon the, hi hazrat mohammad sahab ke asli uttaradhikari the or unhen hi pehla caliph bananaa chahie tha
 However this did not happen and he was made Khalifa, ie the head leader, after three more people
 ali or unke baad unke vanshajon ko islam kaa pramukh bananaa chahie tha, aisa vishvas rakhane vaale shiya hai
 Sunni Muslims believe that the first four Caliphs, including Hazrat Ali, were Satapathis, while Shia Muslims believe that the first three Caliphs were non-legitimate heads of Islam and that they start counting the Imams from Hazrat Ali and that the use of the word Khalifa in this count do not do
 sunni muslim ali ko caliph bhi maanate he or unke putr hossain ko maravane vaale caliph yajid ko kai jagahon par pathbhrasht muslim kehete hai
 The majority of the followers of this sect live mainly in Iran, Iraq, Bahrain and Azerbaijan
 iske alaava syria, kuwait, turki, afghanistan, pakistan, oman, yaman tathaa bharat main bhi shiya aabaadi ek pramukh alpsankhyak ke rup main he
 There are three subdivisions of the faith of Shia Islam - Barhwari, Ismaili and Zaidi
 ek mashhoor haddees mankunto maula fa ha ja ali un maula, jo mohammad sahab ne gadir naamak jagah par apane aakhri haj par khutba diya tha, main spasht kah diya tha ki musalmaan samudaay ko samudaay ali ke kahe kaa anusaran karnaa he
 In 632, Muhammad Sahab addressed his companions near Khumm Sarovar in his last hajj
 shiya vishwaas ke anusaar is kitaab main unhone apane damaad ali ko apana vaaris banaaya tha
 Sunnis consider this incident to be praise for Ali and believe that he did not appoint Hazrat Ali as caliph
 isi baat ko lekar dono pakshon main matbhed shuru hota he
 After the Hajj, Muhammad Sahib began to remain ill
 unhone sabhi bade sahaabiyon ko bula kar kaha ki mujhe kalam daavaat de do ki main tumko esa navishta likh don ki tum bhatko nahin to umr ne kaha ki ye hijayaan kah rahe he or nahin dene diya 
 According to Shia history, even when news of Prophet's death was received, he did not come back and started gathering in Sakifa, what should be done now
 jis samay hazarat mohammad kii mrityu hui, ali or unke kuch or mitra mohammad sahab ko dafanaane main lage the, abu baqar madina main jaakar kilaafat ke liye vimarsh kar rahe the
 Many people of Medina agreed to make Abu Bakr a caliph
 shiya manyataon ke anusaar mohammad sahib evam ali ke kabeeley vaale yani bani hashim ali ko hi khalipha bananaa chaahate the
 But there was no solidarity among the Muslims to inherit the largest empire of Islam ever
 kai logon ke anusaar ali, jo mohammad sahab ke chachere bhai the or damaad bhi hi mohammad sahab ke asli vaaris the
 But Abu Bakr was first made Khalifa and after his death Umar was made Khalifa
 isse ali ke samarthak logon main or bhi rosh failaa parantu ali musalamaanon kii bhalaai ke liye chup rahe
 Usman became the third Khalifa after Omar
 parantu inke samay main shiya rafazi baagiyon logon ne misr tathaa iraq va anya sthano se aakar madina main aakar osman ke ghar ko gher liya 40 din tak osman ke ghar ko gheraav kiya ant main osman ko shahid kar daalaa
 When Osman bin Afan was martyred, he was 79 years old, he was stabbed repeatedly in the head, his wife came to save him, he cut his finger, the tigress came to his house from the back side, in the front
 Hussain Ibne Ali and Hasan Ibne Ali, both sons of Hazrat Ali, were guarding! ab phir se calipha kaa pad khaali tha or islamic samrajya bada ho rahaa tha
 No one saw Muslims other than Hazrat Ali, but Ali did not believe in becoming a Khalifa
 kai din shura ke log khalipha ke pad ko na bhar sake
 Finally, when Ali was forced, you said that Ilahi Nizam would work in my Khilafat
 unhen chauthaa khaliph niyukt kiya gaya
 Ali was famous for his justice, when Ali became the Khalifa, the demand of the former Khalifa Usman's revenge and punishment for him started arising, but seeing the situation of the Muslims and Muslims, Ali did not take any action but the people did not When Raas came, he used an army to punish the killers of Osman
 ali ne kaha osman ke katilo ko sajaa zarur milegi, par inka udyeshy kuch or tha to jamal naamak jang hui
 Sometime later, Mu'awiya, the Subedar of Syria, also opposed Ali
 muavia tisare khaliph osman kaa rishtedaar tha or usee osman ke katilo ke sajaa kii maang se sifphine main jang hui jisamen muavia bhi haar gaya
 In 661, Imam Ali was deceitfully martyred in a mosque in Kufa
 iske baad muavia ne apane ko islam kaa caliph ghoshit kar diya
 Proponents of Hazrat Ali and theoretically Muhammad sa Sahib's relatives showed allegiance to his son Hasan, but some left him
 hasan ibne ali ne jang na kii balki maviya ke saath sandhi kar lee
 Actually, in the time of Ali, in the battle of Siffin, Mavia wanted to become Khalifa
 wo syria kaa governor pichle khalifaaon ke kaaran bane the ab wo apni ek badi sena taiyaar kar rahe the ab usne vahi sawaal imam hasan ke saamne rakhaa: yaa to yuddh yaa phir adheenta
 Imam Hasan did not accept subjugation but he did not want to shed the blood of the Muslims, so he stayed away from the war
 ab maavia bhi kisi bhi tarah satta chaahate the to imam hasan se sandhi karne par majaboor ho gaye
 Imam Hassan handed over power to him only on his terms
 in sharto main se kuch ye hai: - Through such conditions, he became the ruler of a mere name
 uske vansh kaa shashan 750 isvi tak rahaa or unhen umayyad kaha gaya
 All the Tehreek of Shia Muslims consider Ali's younger son and his 11 sons as successors of Islam after Hazrat Muhammad Sahab
 iname sabase pehle imam hasan alhisslam kaa naam aata he, aap imam ali ke jyeshtha putr the or aap ne imam ali ke baad 47 saal kii aayu main khilaafat sambhaali
 You remained the Khalifa for only 6 months, after which you resigned from political rule after the treaty with Mawiya, but you continued to guide your followers under the honorable post of Imam, who came to you after Imam Ali a
 shiya itihaas ke anusaar aapako mavia ne sajeesh karke shahid kar diya
 According to your will, Imam Hussain took over the post of Imam after you
 aapse hi karbala kii mahaan katha sambandhit he
 When you explicitly refused to support Yavid, the malicious son of Mavia, you were surrounded and martyred by an army of 30,000 or more, including your family and friends, who were 72 in total

 The practice of Namaz from the beginning of Islam and the order to read it
 yah musalamaanon kaa bahut bada kartavya he or ise niyampurvak padhanaa punya tathaa tyaag dena paap he
 There is a law for every Muslim to offer Namaz for five times per day
 namaaj padhane ke pehle prayek musalmaan vuju karata he arthath kuhaniyon tak haath kaa dhota he, munh va naak saaf karata he, puraa mukh dhota he
 "ajaan" is also offered if the Namaz is being held in a mosque
 namaaj tathaa ajaan ke bich main lagbhag 15 minuton kaa antar hota he
 In Urdu, ajaan means call
 namaaj ke pehle ajaan isliye di jaati he ki aas-paas ke musalamaanon ko namaaj kii soochna mil jaae or ve sansaarik kaaryon ko chhodkar kuch minuton ke liye masjid main khuda kaa dhyaan karne ke liye aa jaaen
 Namaz is also read alone and with the group
 yadi namaaj saath milakar padhi ja rahi he to usamen ek manushya sabase aage khadaa ho jaataa he, jise imam kehete hai or bache log pankti baandhakar peeche khadey ho jate hai
 The Imam recites the Namaz and others follow it
 namaaj padhane ke liye musalmaan makka kii ore mukh karke khadaa ho jaataa he, namaaj kii ichha karata he or phir "allaah akbar" kahkar takabeer kahata he
 In addition, it raises both hands up to the ears and binds it near the navel on the chest

 After a few moments, he sits on his knees and then falls into Sijda
 phir kuch der ke baad khadaa ho jaataa he
 In between all these works, he also recites small devotions, praising Allah
 is prakaar namaaj kii ek rachaat samaapt hoti he
 Then the second rakaat reads like this and sits on knees on the sijda
 phir pehle dayee ore munh pherata he or tab bain ore
 In addition to this, he raises his hand from Allah and asks for prayers and thus completes the two rakat prayers, most of the prayers are recited by two rakats and sometimes four rakats are also recited
 padhane kii chaal kam adhik yahi he
 The Quran forms a statement in one of its verses: i imaan waalon sabar or namaajon se kaam lo Clearly, Allah has the honor for the ease of offering prayers
 5 namaajon kii misaal aisi he, maano aapke dwaar par 5 pavitra nahare
 din main 5 baar aap uname snaan kar ke kya apavitra rah sakate hai? vaise hi aap apane man ko in naharon main snaan karvaa duniya dwaara di gai kalikh or mile ko dho daalate hai

 As a result, the humiliation of these people became old and those people went where they should have gone

 a Personal Navigation Assistant is also known as Personal Navigation Device or Portable Navigation Device is a portable electronic product which combines a positioning capability and navigation functions
 Some PNA devices are pdas with limited features and can be unlocked
 The earliest pnas were hand-held GPS units which were capable of displaying the user's location on an electronic map
 These units included simple navigation functions such as course-to-steer and course-made-good
 This first generation of pnas were used by the US military
 According to the analyst firm Berg Insight, there were more than 150 million turn-by-turn navigation systems worldwide in mid-2009, including about 35 million factory installed and aftermarket in-dash navigation systems, over 90 million Personal Navigation Devices and an estimated 28 million navigation-enabled mobile handsets with GPS
 The term PNA has come into widespread use with the growing popularity of automobile navigation systems
 The latest generation of PNA has sophisticated navigation functions and feature a variety of user interfaces including maps, turn-by-turn guidance and voice instructions
 To reduce total cost of ownership and time to market, most modern PNA devices such as those made by Garmin Ltd
, Mio Technology Ltd
 or tomtom International BV
 are running an off-the-shelf embedded operating system such as Windows CE or Embedded Linux on commodity hardware with OEM versions of popular PDA Navigation software packages such as tomtom Navigator, I-GO 2006, Netropa intellinav iguidance, or Destinator
 Other manufacturers like Garmin and Magellan prefer to bundle their own software developed in-house
 Because many of these devices use an embedded OS, many technically inclined users find it easy to modify pnas to run third party software and use them for things other than navigation, such as a low-cost audio-video player or PDA replacement
 Meantime, Nokia, Samsung Electronics, Motorola and other handset makers will sell 162 million GPS equipped phones in 2007, dwarfing the 20 million units Garmin and tomtom have forecast they will sell combined, according to isuppli, a leading market researcher in California
 The inclusion of Google Maps Navigation in Android devices such as Motorola Droid and Nokia's announcement of free Ovi Maps lead to many people using their smartphones instead of having a separate PNA for trip navigation

 Atheism or Atheism or Atheism is a doctrine that does not accept the existence of any God who creates, governs and controls the world on the basis of the absence of universal evidence
 naastik log ishwar ke astitv kaa spasht pramaan na hone kaaran jhooth qaraar dete hai
 Most atheists do not believe in any deity, supernatural power, religion and soul
 hindu darshan main naastik shabd unke liye bhi prayukt hota he jo vedon ko manyata nahin dete
 Atheists believe in knowing rather than believing
 vahiin aastik kisi na kisi ishwar kii dharna ko apane dharm, sampradaay, jati, kul yaa mat ke anusaar bina kisi pramanikta ke sweekaar karata he
 Atheism calls it superstition because no two religions and beliefs have the same belief in God
 naastikta roodhiwaadee dharanaon ke aadhaar nahin balki vaastaviktaa or pramaan ke aadhaar par hi ishwar ko sweekaar karne kaa darshan he
 All the reasoning and evidence so far is insufficient to accept the authority of God for atheism
 buddha dharm maanvi mulyon tathaa aadhunik vigyaan kaa samarthak he or buddha anuyaayi kaalpanik ishwar main vishwaas nahin karte he
 Hence Albert Einstein, Dr
 B
 R
 Many scientific and talented people like Ambedkar, Bernat Russell consider Buddhism as a scientific religion
 china desh kii aabaadi main 91% se bhi adhik log buddha dharm ke anuyaayi he, isliye duniya ke sabase adhik naastik log china main he
 Atheists can also be associated with religion
 darshan kaa anishvarwad ke anusaar jagat swayan sanchalit or swayan shasit he
 The atheists criticize all of them by giving proof for the existence of God, and try to prove that the creator of such a world cannot be a God by following the following types of arguments explaining the worldly faults
 ishwarwadi kehete he ki manushya ke man main ishvarpratyay janm se hi he or vah swayansiddh evam anivaary he
 It signifies the existence of God
 iske uttar main anishvaravaadi kehete hai ki ishvarbhaavana sabhi manushyon main anivaary rup se nahin pai jaati or yadi pai bhi jaati ho to keval man kii bhaavana se bahari vastuon kaa astitv siddh nahin hota
 Many concepts of mind have been proved imperfect by science
 jagat main sabhi vastuon kaa kaaran hota he
 There is no work without reason
 kaaran do prakaar ke hote hai-ek upadan, jiske dwaara koi vastu banati he or doosraa nimitt, jo usko banaata he
 The theologians say that the whole world is also a work like a clock, a board and a clock, and so should be the cause of gratitude and purpose
 kuch log ishwar ko jagat kaa nimitt kaaran or kuch log nimitt or upadan donon hi kaaran maanate hai
 In response to this tactic, the atheist says that we have no proof that the entire world, like ghat, pat and clock, was also generated and started at some time
 iskaa pravaah anadi he, at: iske srashta or upadan kaaran ko foundne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 If the creator of the world is accepted as a God who will face many difficulties; As such, what was the purpose in creating it? How can physical creation only do mental or spiritual power? If its substance is accepted as a physical substance, then how can it control it? He himself works with the help of physical body or equipment or without his help? Where did those tools and that physical body come from without creation? What is the purpose of God by creating such a creation, which his devotees consider to be omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent, in which the end of life is in death, the end of happiness, in sadness, in dissociation, and in decadence of progress? What is the benefit of creating this sad world, where the organism lives by eating the organism, and where all the beings are enemies to each other and all the beings struggle among themselves? The plight of this world is well described in one verse of Yogavashistha, sirf isliye ki vigyaan prayog main, samajha nahin saktaa jaise pyaar jo kavita likhane ke liye kavi ko prerit karata he, iskaa arth yah nahin he ki dharm kar saktaa he
 It is a simple and logical fallacy to say that, 'if science cannot do something, religion can
 -richard dockins' Theologians offer a strategy that in this material world, under all things and in all creation, rules and purpose are found meaningful
 yah baat isaki dyotak he ki iskaa sanchaalan karanevaala koi budhimaan ishwar he is yukti kaa anishvarwad is prakaar khandan karata he ki sansar main bahut si ghatnaayen aisi bhi hoti hai jinka koi uddeshy, athwa kalyankari uddeshy nahin jaan padataa, yatha ativrishti, anaavrishti, akaal, baadh, aag lag janaa, akalmrityu, jaraa, vyaadhiyaan or bahut se hinsak or dusht praani
 The more rules and unity visible in the world, the more irregularity and opposition can be seen
 inkaa kaaran foondnaa utana hi aavashyak he jitna niyamon or aikya kaa
 Just as a king or state administration controls all people in society in behavior towards one another, similarly there is a need for a God who rules over all creatures of the world and to torture, punish and reward them for sin and virtue
 iske uttar main anishvaravaadi yah kahata he ki sansar main prakritik niyamon ke atirikt or koi niyam nahin dikhaai padate
 The distinction between sin and virtue is false which man has made out of his mind
 yahan par sab kriyaaon kii pratikriyaayein hoti rahati hai or sab kaamon kaa lekha baraabar ho jaataa he
 No other regulator and ruler is required for this
 yadi paap or punya ke liye dand or puraskaar kaa prabandh hota tathaa unako rokane or karaanevaala koi ishwar hota; or puneatmaon kii raksha hua karti tathaa papatmaon ko dand mila karata to isamsih or gandhi jaise puneatmaon kii nrushans hatya na ho paati
 In this way, atheism denies theistic axioms and even says that if one is to be the creator of such a world, then only the wicked and foolish devil will have to be believed, not the wise and benevolent God
 paashchaatya darshanikon main anek anishvaravaadi ho gaye hai or hai
 Jain, Buddhist, Charvak, Sankhya and Purvimamsa philosophies are atheistic philosophies in India
 in darshanon main di gai yuktiyon kaa sundar sankalan haribhadra suri likhit shaddarshan samucchy ke upar gunratn ke likhe hue bhashya, kumaril bhatta ke shlokavarthik or ramanujacharya ke brahmasutra par likhe gaye shribhashya main paaya jaataa he
 Religion does the work of dividing man
 atah ishwar sirf janata kaa opium hota he
 The word atheist is used in Indian philosophy in three meanings
 jo log veda ko param pramaan nahin maanate ve naastik kehalaate hai
 According to this definition, the followers of Buddhist, Jain and Lokayat schools are called atheists and these three philosophies do not believe in God or Vedas, hence they are called atheist philosophies
 jo log paralok or mrityupashchaat jivan main vishwaas nahin karte; is paribhaasha ke anusaar keval charvak darshan jise lokayat darshan bhi kehete hai, bharat main naastik darshan kehalaata he or uske anuyaayi naastik kehalaate hai
 Those who do not believe in the existence of God
 ishwar main vishwaas na karanevaale naastik kai prakaar ke hote hai
 Extreme atheists are those who do not believe in any form of God
 charvak matvaale bharat main or rank athist log paashchaatya deshen main ishwar kaa astitv kisi rup main sweekaar nahin karte; ardhanasti unka kah sakate hai jo ishwar kaa sristi, paalan or sanhaarkarta ke rup main nahin maanate
 According to this definition, many philosophies of India fall under the category of atheists
 vastav main nyaay or vedant darshanon ko chhodkar bharat ke anya darshan sankhya, yoga, vaisheshik, buddha or jain naastik darshan kahe ja sakate hai kyonki inamen ishwar ko sarjak, paalak or vinaashak nahin mana gaya he
 Only such atheists are called atheists
