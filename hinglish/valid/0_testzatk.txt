 The main cause of water pollution is the pollutants born as a result of human or animal biological or industrial activities, to be directly immersed in the water streams without proper treatment
 The main causes which pollute the water are chemical, pathogenic, and physical or Sensory Changes Although many chemicals and elements that occur naturally, water is used to find the key to concentration
 Nritic components and contaminants are seen
 Many chemical substances are rich
 Pathogens can cause waterborne diseases in humans or animals
 The physicochemical changes in water include acidity, electrical conductivity, temperature, and aerotrophication

 bhinn-bhinn vyaktiyon ke netra bhi bhinn bhinn rangon ke prakaash ko bhinn bhinn dhangon se evam bhinn bhinn matraaon main grahan karte hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to measure the gamut of two light sources by comparing the light emitted from them with the emission of a standard source and considering the output of that standard as a unit, otherwise one cannot be unanimous in evaluating the spectral radius

 The best tithe of the magnetic intensity per unit centimeter of the Planckian radius is called the international candel or candela
 yah candil shakti main maapi jaati he
 The magnetic flux transmitted in cubic angles per unit per second by a light source is called the illumination capacity of that source
 maan len r ardhavyas ke gole ke centre u par ek antarrashtriya candil pradeepan kshamta kaa prakashasrot rakhaa hua he
 The flux emitted by this source will be distributed evenly over the entire inner plane of the sphere

 Since the total flux on the inner surface of the entire sphere is F, the flux falling on it will be the tenth part of F
 isamen sa / r2 = ghan kone da va 
 Therefore, if c = r 2 = 1, then d = 1 and the falling flux will be = 1

 If the light source does not radiate the same light in all directions, its illumination in any direction, in a cube, dap = dwaara vyakt hogi
 And total flux in that case = The mean of the flux of the unit cube is called the mean candle power of the light source

 Ten's cosine cosine will be q in the direction of q and thus the quantity of light transmitted per unit between q and dq is b q cosine q
 dq 2p sin q dq) so the total amount of light transmitted per unit area in all directions = hogi
 The value of q is constant for full diffuser planes

 Since then, repeated suggestions have been made to the Council that the Council should have punitive powers to punish defaulting newspapers / journalists
 iske jawaab main parishad ne lagaataar yahi vichaar kiya he ki adhinium kii vidyaman yojana ke antargat ise diye gayi naitik adhikaar paryaapt hai
 This suggestion was reiterated by the Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting in its inaugural address at the International Conference of Press Circles in New Delhi in October 1992, but the Council unanimously rejected it for the following reasons - yadi parishad ko dand dene / jurmaana lagane kaa adhikaar de diya jaataa to yah dand dene ke adhikaar ke samaan hota joki keval tabhi lagu hota he jab press dwaara sarkaar tathaa iske praadhikariyon ke viruddh shikaayatein kii jaati hai

 parishad ne june 93 kii apni baithak main, parishad ko dandatmak adhikaar diye jane ke viruddh vigat samay main iske dwaara liye gayi stand ke prakaash main maamle par vichaar kiya
 After taking a deeper look at the matter, the Council felt that the moral authority currently being exercised by the Council is quite effective and that the press does not require punitive rights to show self-regulation
 haalanki parishad ne nirnay kiya ki yadi ek samachaarpatr teen varshon main kisi prakaar ke aniatik lekhan ke liye do baar parinindit kiya jaataa he, tab aise nirnyon kii pratiyaan bharat sarkaar ke mantrimandal sachiv or sambaddh rajya sarkaar ke mukhya sachiv, ko suchnarth or aisi kaarywahi, jaisaaki ve apane vivek or maamle kii paristhitiyon main uchit samajhe, hetu bheji jaani chahie

 The Council had prepared a comprehensive set of principles through its decisions / guidelines in 1984 in association with the Indian Institute of Law, as a violation of public interest and journalism policy
 siddhanton kaa yah sankalan parishad ke nirnyon athwa adhinirnyon athwa iske athwa iske dwaara athwa iske adhyaksh dwaara jari morganirdeshon se chunaa gaya he
 In 1986, complaints or cases against the government and its authorities, which were far-reaching and significant in nature and included comments respecting the conduct of any authority, including the government, violated the freedom of the press relating to decisions and principles in the title

 varsh 1986 se samhita nirmaan kii twarit prakiya sahit shikayaton kii sansthapana or press parishad dwaara unke niptaan main lagaataar vruddhi hoti rahi he
 In 1992, the Council presented the Journalism Policy Guide, which contains the journalistic policy principles sorted from the guidelines and decisions issued by the Council
 chunki tab se parishad dwaara press ke adhikaron or dayitvon se sambaddh kai atyadhik mahatvapurn nirnay diye gayi hai, morganirdeshika kaa 162 pruthon kaa vistrut or vyapak doosraa sanskaran jari kiya ja chukaa he

 The Council made an important award in relation to the alleged defamation of public officials of the Municipal Committee that remedies of action against the press or media for damages are not generally available to government officials in relation to their functions and conduct related to the discharge of their official duties, Whether the publication is based on facts and statements that are not true, unless the office SH should not establish that the revelation was done without respect and care for the truth
 aise maamle main bachaav paksh media athwa press kaa sadsy ke liye yah siddh karnaa paryaapt hoga ki unhone tathyon ke samuchit samyaapan ke pashchaat kaary kiya, unke liye yah siddh karnaa aavashyak nahin he ki unhone jo kuch likhaa he, vah satya he
 But where it is proved that the publication is tending and false to malicious or express hatred, there will be no defense for the defendants and will be liable for the loss
 haalaanki ek saarvajanik padaadhikari koun maamalon main joki unki duty ke nirvaah se sambanddh na hon, vahi suraksha milti he jaisaaki kisi anya naagarik ko milti he
 However, the Judiciary, Parliament and State Legislature are the exception to this rule as the former is protected by the right of punishment for its contempt and is protected from privileges under Articles 105 and 194 of the succeeding Constitution
 parishad ne aage diya he ki iskaa arth yah nahin he ki shaskeey gupt baat adhinium, 1923 athwa koi samaan adhiniuman athwa upbandh jise kanoonee shakti praapt ho, press athwa media par niyantran nahin rakh sakate
 It has also been given that there is no law which empowers the state or its officials to have prior control or prohibition on the press / media
 saarvajanik padaadhikari ke niztaa ke daawey ke sambandh main, parishad ne nirdit kiya he ki yadi saarvajanik padaadhikari kii niztaa or unke nijee aacharan, aadaton vyaktigat kaaryon or charitra kii visheshtaon, jinka takaraav athwa sambandh unki shaskeey duty ke samuchit nirvaah se ho, ke bare main jaanane ke jaanata ke adhikaar ke madhya takaraav ho, to purvavarti ko uttarvarti ke saamne jhukna chahie
 However, in matters of personal privacy not related to the maintenance of their official duties, the public official gets the same protection as any other citizen

 The Guidelines are not a compilation of irrefutable principles but contain broad general principles, which are applied with proper discretion and adaptation, depending on the circumstances of each case, so they are self-restrained to journalists to conduct their business, including the path of professional honesty Will help them to do it
 kisi bhi tarah ye thakaau nahin he na hi inkaa abhipraay sakhti he joki press ke svachhand kaary main baadha daale
 Some of the broad principles developed by the Council in relation to its decision on various subjects, both on the levels of journalism and freedom of the press, are briefly given as follows
 sampradaayon or vyaktiyon par apmanjanak or uttejk hamale nahin kiye jane chahie
 Any news journalism policy on communal incidents based on rumors would be violated
 isi prakaar mahatvapurn chook karte hue vikrut reportig karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 While it is a legitimate task of the press to address this with the intention of resolving the right grievance of a community in a peaceful and legal manner, complaints should not be discovered / or exaggerated especially those complaints involving communal disharmony
 Have the ability to
 swasth or shantipurna vaataavaran paidaa karne main yah atyadhik laabhadaayak hoga yadi sansanikhej uttejk or khatarnaak shirkon ko chhod diya jaye or hinsa athwa barbarta ke kaaryon kii report is prakaar se kii jaye ki rajya kii kanoon or vyavastha main logon kaa vishwaas kam na ho tathaa iske saath-saath isamen aise kaaryon ko hatotsahit karne or unki ninda karne kaa prabhaav ho
 Defaming a sect is a serious matter and it would be condemnable to call it anti-national activity and it is akin to journalistic inconsistency
 vigat galatiyon ko dohraane ke viruddh vartmaan peedi ko chetavanee dene ke liye aitihaasik tathyon ko prakashit karne main koi asangati nahin he chaahe ye galtiyaan ek vishesh sampradaay ke liye ruchikar na hon
 There is no objection in making statements about religious sects if they are given in moderate language and are not given inaccurate or exaggerated
 patrakarita ke anuchit prayog ke sambandh main apane nirnyon ke madhyam se parishad dwaara viksit kiye gayi kuch siddhant hai Any matter shown or discussed in confidence should not be published without the consent of the source
 yadi sampadak ko aisa lagata he ki prakaashan janhit main he, tab use uchit paad-tippanee main yah spat karnaa chahie ki sambaddh vaktavy athwa vichaar-vimarsh prakashit kiya ja rahaa tha yadhyapi ise anadhikarik diya gaya tha
 An advertisement which is illegal or illegal or which is contrary to good faith or journalistic policy or justification should not be published
 samachaarpatron dwaara uddharanon ke sambandh main sateekta banaaye rakhane ke liye samuchit saavdhaanee barti jaani chahie
 Where a newspaper is accused of violating journalistic policy, the argument that it has ceased publication will not protect the editor because his conduct is the subject of the complaint
 ruchi kaa arth sandarbh ke anusaar alag-alag hota he
 For a journalist, this means that they should not publish on the basis of decency or justification
 jahaan ek maamle main yon sambandhi bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane kii pravriti ho, patrika main iskaa prakaashan janata, yuva athwa vruddh ke liye avaanchhneeya hoga
 Public interest should be judged with the perception of the prevailing interest in the contemporary society along with the situation
 ashleelata kaa mul pareekshan yah he ki kya maamla itnaa abhadra he ki yah charitra ko bigaad athwa bhrat kar saktaa he
 Another test is whether the portrayal of the language and scene used may be considered dirty, vulgar, distasteful or erotic
 koi bhi kahani ashleel he athwa nahin, patrika kii saahitiyik athwa saanskrithik prakruti or saamaajik viy ke str vastu jaise karkon par nirbhar karengi
 The picture of a case against a magazine or newspaper is related to the question whether the matter published is below the level of public interest
 pikchar janaruchi se kam he athwa nahin, yah parakhane ke sambaddh karkon main se ek patrika kii prakruti athwa uddeshy hoga- kya yah kala, chitrakala, dawa shodh, athwa yon sudhaar se sambaddh he
 The Press Council expressed concern over the increasing instances of pornographic advertisements in the printing media
 yah sansrship ke viruddh thi parantu prakaashan se purv kisi ashleel saamagree kii jaanch hetu nivaaran sambandhi upayon kaa samarthan kiya gaya
 Since most such advertisements are delivered through advertising agencies, the Council felt that this task would not be difficult if these agencies were more prepared to prepare and release such advertisements, which would be considered objectionable by an average citizen in the family
 Use caution and time
 inhone mahasoos kiya ki bharat kii vigyaapan agenciyon kaa sangh in sabhi vigyaapan agenciyon ke sangrakshak sanghathan ke rup main maamle main atyadhik mahatvapurn or sakaaratmak bhoomika nibhaa sakegaa or aise vigyaapan na dene main inke sahyog kii maang kii joki jinase sighra samay mendesh ke saamaajik saanskrithik mulyon ko nuksaan pahunchne kii sambhaavna ho
 The Council also appealed to the newspapers to carefully examine the advertisements received directly from advertisers or from advertising agencies and exercise self-restraint by rejecting advertisements deemed indecent and objectionable
 akshepit prakaashan ke viruddh swayan dwaara banaaye gayi nimnlikhit morganirdeshon ko bhi inhone doharaaya
 Newspapers should not give advertisements that are obscene or depict a woman in nudity to provoke the sexuality of men as if it were an object of sale itself
 ek tasviir ashleel he athwa nahin, yah teen pareekshanon ke sambandh main parkhaa janaa chahie, abhidhantah 1, is it vulgar and hopeless, 2, kya yah keval ashleel lekhan kaa ansh he, 3, Is the purpose of this publication only in those among whom it is intended to circulate, and to earn money by stimulating the sexual feelings of adolescents
 duusare shabdon main, kya yah vanijyik laabh ke liye hanikaarak shon he
 Another relevant point of view is that the picture is related to the thematic matter of the magazine
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kya iskaa prakaashan kala, chitrakala, dawa, shodh athwa yon sudhaar kisi saamaajik athwa lok uddeshy ke purv chintan kii purti karata he
 The basic principle that emerges from various awards on this view supports the editor's self-determination in the publication of letters
 haalaanki, inase aashaa kii jaati he ki ve saarvajanik prakruti ke maamle par galat vaktavy athwa report ko swayan thik karenge
 On the basis of public right to know, the common reader can claim a legitimate right
 iske atirikt, koi vyakti jiskaa prakaashan main viy rup se sandarbh diya gaya ho, samachaarpatr ke stambho main uttar ke adhikaar ke liye swatah daawa kar saktaa he
 If the Council does not have the right to force a newspaper to publish a response, it may direct the newspaper to publish the details of the investigation against it
 prakaashan se purv samachar kaa satyaapan aavashyak he vishe rup se jab report main apmanjanak athwa likhit manahani sambandhi adhiswar hon athwa isse sampradayik tanaav ho saktaa ho, na hi kinhin paristhitiyon main bhi logon ke duusare varg ke vichaaron ke rup main afvaahon kaa prakaashan nyyochit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 Whenever a false or malformed publication is noticed by the editor, they should make necessary amendments
 bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 499 ke duusare apwaad ke antargat ek saarvajanik karmchaaree ke saarvajanik kaaryon ke nirvaah main unke aacharan kaa sammaan karte hue athwa unke charitra kaa sammaan karte hue, jahaan tak us aacharan main unka charitra dikhaai detaa he, kuch anya nahin, sadbhaavna main raay abhivyakt karnaa manahani nahin he
 Accordingly, the Council is of the opinion that proper comments / comments on life cannot be said to be inappropriate but if any factual statements are made, they should be true and correct
 yadi koi manahanijanak tatv judaa hota he, to nuksaan hetu kisi bhi prakaar kii civil kaarywahi main adhik sadbhaavna bachaav nahin hoga
 The Press Council of India has laid down guidelines to achieve a balance between the right of privacy of the public and the right of the public to access information of public interest and public importance
 ratreey or antarratreey str tathaa dilli main april 1998 main press parishadon ke vishwa sangh ke sammelan main hui garma garam bahes main bal diya gaya ki is sambandh main teen pratiyogi sanvaidhanik mulyon ke madhya saamanjasy sthapit karne kii aavashyaktaa he, arthatah A, a person's right to privacy, kha, press kii swatantraaa or C, People's right to know about popular persons in public interest
 parishad ne is maamle par report taiyaar kii he or nimnanusaar morganirdesh banaaye he - Right to privacy is an inviolable human right
 haalaanki niztaa kii degree sthiti or ek vyakti se duusare vyakti ke liye alag-alag hoti he
 Public individuals who act as representatives of the public cannot expect to get the same degree of privacy as private individuals
 unke kaary or aacharan janhit main hota he
 Public interest is being kept out of public interest, even if privately, it should be brought to the notice of the people through the press
 iske anuroop yah sunishchit karnaa press kii duty he ki saarvajanik vyakti ke saarvajanik hit ke aise kaaryon or aacharan ke bare main soochna sahi tareekon se praapt kii jaati he, samuchit rup se satyapit karne or tatpashchaat sateek report di jaati he
 Monitoring methods are not expected from the press to get information about the work done away from public eye
 jahaan se yah aashaa kii jaati he ki lokapriy vyaktiyon ko tang na karen, vahiin lokapriy saarvajanik vyaktiyon se bhi yah aashaa kii jaati he ki ve apni karypranali main adhik khulaapan laayen tathaa janata ko unke pratinidhiyon ke kaaryon ke baaren main suchit karne kii press kii dyuty ko puraa karne main press ko sahyog den
 An attack on a newspaper or people who are associated with it as an editorial or in management, with the intention of pressuring or intimidating them for the opinions expressed in the newspaper is a gross interference in the freedom of the press

 Apart from this, wherever there is a serious situation in which the press is expected to act with restraint and caution, the President of the Council has been guiding the press through statements
 jab kabhi bhi suniyojit biihat hamale kiye gayi, tab inhone aise vaktavyon ke madhyam se teevr pratikriya bhi kii
 In 1969, the Council issued 10-point guidelines specifying rules and levels in reporting and commenting on matters related to communal relations

 The Council said that the principles outlined in it should be embedded at every level of the media from the stage of training
 in siddhanton sanlagnak bi-2 ne press or rajya donon ke liye kuch kaary karne or kuch kaary na karne nirdit kiye
 The Council has in the past years formulated a policy framework on certain matters such as selection of journalists, advertisements, news papers, rules of recognition to accompany the President, Prime Minister etc

 The study of these awards shows that the Council was not only pressurized to preserve freedom but also to ensure that the level of journalism is maintained and efforts to achieve its goals like improving it were also undeniably successful
 Has been jahaan press, parishad ke hastkshep ke pashchaat praadhikariyon ko, aamtaur par, press par anuchit dabaav na daalate hue dekha gaya he vahiin press karmiyon ne bhi is prakaar kii patrakarita se swayan par sanyam rakhaa he joki unase, jis str kii aashaa kii jaati he, ko kam kar sakati thi
 The Council's moral impact has been widely accepted
 shikayaton kii sankhya 1979 main 80 se 1997 main 1075 tak kii atyaadhik vruddhi, samachaarpatron par niyantran rakhane ke liye parishad jaisi sanstha kii aavashyaktaa, mahatv or karypranali main media karmiyon or jaanata donon dwaara abhivyikt kiye gayi vishwaas kaa paryaapt pramaan he
 In addition to the investigation on regular complaints, the council has often done special investigation, mostly original action, but sometimes also investigated complaints related to incidents and cases related to the press
 gartala, tripura ke ek bengali samachaarpatr daily deshr katha ke sampadak shri gautam das dwaara unke samachaarpatr bechney waalon or karmchaariyon par congress ai kaaryakartaaon dwaara lagaataar hinsaatmak hamale kiye jane kii shikaayat ke pashchaat press parishad ne ghatnasthal kii samuchit jaanch hetu ek vishesh samiti kaa gathan kiya he
 The committee visited Agartala and heard the complainant and representatives of the Tripura government
 iske parinamswaroop tripura sarkaar ne aashwaasan diya ki ve aisi ghatnaon kii punrariti ko rokane ke liye sabhi aavashyak kadam uthaayenge or deshr katha ko purna suraksha pradaan karenge
 a special investigation was conducted on Ayodhya incidents in 1990 and others in 1992
 inaki report kramshah 1991 or 1993 main saarvajanik kii gai
 In the first inquiry, the council found four Uttar Pradesh Dainik Jagran, today, Swatantra Bharat and Swatantra Chetna to publish such reports which grossly violated journalistic policy rules
 parishad ne niyamon kaa ulanghan karne par in samachaarpatron ko parinindit kiya
 The council also criticized the Uttar Pradesh government for its many errors in dealing with the situation and its behavior towards the press
 jaagran ne parishad ke is nirnay ko elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke sammukh chunauti di, joki lambit he
 He expressed concern over the authorities taking recourse to punitive and preventive proceedings in excess of the demand of the situation and expressed condolences on the call for provisions of the Unwelcome Press Offensive Affairs Act 1951 and misuse of the provisions of the Press and Book Registration Act 1867
 ayodhya main dinaank 6-12-1992 ko vivaadaaspad masjid giraaye jane par aise patrkaar / press media photographer / cameraman joki dinaank 6-12-92 ko ayodhya kii ghatnaon or iske aas-paas kawarej kar rahe the, par kai hamale kiye jane kii report aayin
 As this was a matter of utmost importance and concern, a special inquiry committee was constituted to investigate the matter under the chairmanship of the Chairman of the Council

 Through this, he gave his full support in protest against the demand of any code or rule
 isi prakaar jammu va kashmir main press dwaara saamana kii ja rahi samasyaon par vishe jaanch kii gai
 Accepting the report of this committee in July 1991, the Council stated that the importance of information and communication in the complex and difficult situation in Kashmir was not adequately realized by the government or the media itself
 inhone sthiti ke vibhinn drutkonon kaa prabhavi uttar dene ke liye maapdandon kii shrinkhalaa kaa suzav diya
 The full report was published later under the title Crisis and Credibility
 bihar main press kii swatantra karypranali ke maarg main dabaavon / baadhaon or patrakaron par hamalon kii badhati hui ghatnaon par report jise parishad ne dinaank 31 march 1993 ko sweekaar kiya, main press or praadhikariyon ko apane sambandh adhik swasth santhaapit karne kaa paraamarsh diya gaya
 In the report on AIDS and the media, the media was determined to do some work and not to do anything and they were advised that AIDS must be the target of publicity from sporadic news
 isi samay, press ko yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki janhit joki vyaktigat niztaa ke sangrakshan ke antargat ek maamle ke prakaashan ko nyyochit tehra saktaa he, vaid hit hona chahie na ki viyasakt athwa vikrut jigyaasa

 The report has also advised the government to provide institutional and regional security to media personnel who face threats from extremists on adopting an independent approach
 varsh 1994 main parishad ne sampurna bharat main lagu karne hetu samaan vigyaapan niti kaa nirmaan kiya
 It provides a criterion for approval of newspapers for registration by the authorities for advertisement
 bhartiya press parishad kaa, vaanchhneeyata athwa anyathaa matdaan purv surveykshanon kii uplabdhiyon ke prakaashan or unke dwaara puraa kiye jane vaale uddeshy ke prashn par vichaar karne ke pashchaat vichaar he ki samachaarpatron ko chunaavon main herpher or vikrutiyon ke liye apane manch kaa istemaal kiye jane kii manjuuri nahin deni chahie or pakshpaati partiyon dwaara swayan ke shon kii sweekruti nahin deni chahie
 Therefore, the advice of Prea Council is that in view of the serious situation of the election process in an ideal democracy like ours, newspapers should be aware that their valuable platform should not be used for election manipulation and distortions
 aaj is par bal dena aavashyak ho gaya he kyonki kathith matdaan purv surveykshanon jose galat tareekon ke istemaal ke saath-saath jaateey, dharmik or naitik aadhaar par jatil or tikshn prachaar dwaara apratyaashit matadaataaon ke bhramit or gumraah karne ke liye dilchaspee rakhane vaale vyaktiyon or samoohon dwaara mudran media ke shon kii maang badhati ja rahi he
 While in many cases it will not be difficult to detect communal and seditious propaganda, it is not easy to reveal the biased use of pre-poll surveys, sometimes done intentionally
 atah press parishad kaa suzav he ki jab kabhi bhi samachaarpatr matdaan-purv surveykshan prakashit karte hai, to unhen un sansthaaon jinhone aise surveykshan kiye hai, vyakti or sanghathan jinhone surveykshan karawaaye hai, chayan kiye gayi namoonay kaa aakaar-prakaar jaanch parinaam hetu namoonay ke chayan kaa tarika or jaanch parinaam main truti kii sambhavit gujaaish kaa sanket dete hue unhen suspat rup se prastaavna main dene kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 2, In addition to this, media is seen giving a post-poll poll which has already taken place when the polling dates are in the red
 isamen un matadaataaon ko prabhavit karne kii sambhaavna rahati he jahaan matdaan abhi armbh hona he
 To ensure that the election process is kept clean and the voters' minds are not influenced by external factors, it is necessary that the media does not publish post-poll surveys till the last vote
 3, atah press parishad press se pasch-matdaan ke bare main nimnlikhit morganirdesh kaa paalan karne kaa anurodh karti he
 No newspaper will publish post-poll surveys, however accurate they may be, until the last voting ends
 gha, bhartiya press parishad dwaara vittiya patrakaron ke liye morganirdeshon kaa nirmaan Press Council of India has advised reporters / financial journalists / newspaper establishments not to take cash or any kind of gifts / grants / concessions / facilities etc
, which are likely to compromise with free and fair reporting on financial matters

 He observed that some newspapers / magazines of some companies give excessive news as they have issued advertisements to that printing media
 kabhi-kabhi un companiyon kii pratikul reportein prakashit kii jaati hai joki samachaarpatron athwa patrikaon ko vigyaapan nahin dete hai
 Again, when the media is not happy with a company / management for any reason, the negative aspects of the company are exposed, while its negative, no negative aspects are brought to light
 kuch companeeyon ko kuch vittiya patrakaron se companeeyon ke samarthan main sakaaratmak reportein praapt karne ke liye, unhen uphaar, rin, chhot, praathmik share aadi dene rke lae bhi janaa jaataa he
 Along with this, there is no means for creating public opinion against such wrong actions or for the education of investors
 3, niyamit kshetra main kadachaar par chintit parishad ne, pratinidhi vittiya sansthaanon or patrakaron ke saath vistrut vichaar vimarsh karne ke pashchaat vittiya patrakaron dwaara avlokan hetu nimna varnit morganirdeshon kii sifarish kii he 1, Financial journalists should not accept gifts, loan visits, discounts, primary shares etc
 that compromise their positions, or are likely to compromise
 2, kisi company ke bare main report main pramukh rup se yah ullekh hona chahie ki report company ke vittiya praayojakon athwa company dwaara di gayi soochna par aadhaarit he
 3, when the tour is sponsored for visiting a company arrangement, the author of the report, who has taken advantage of the tour, must mention that the tour was sponsored by the affiliate company and that they have enjoyed hospitality as the case may be

 prakaash jha ne jab ajay devgan or kaajol ko lekar film:dil kya kare banaai, tabhi se unako apni film ke liye ek sthaayee nayak mila
 Gangajal and his experiences of kidnapping were very good with Ajay Devgan and perhaps that is why he is also an important part of the politics film

 After that, their opening partner, Sid Barnes, and Bradman give the Indians a chance and Barnes did not perish for an "innocent" 112 before again putting the proceedings on 236 for the second wicket

 Bradman was once again made up of Indian bowlers, and he, Hasett, along with the next batsman, added 105 runs for the third wicket before Bradman fell to Hazare, who contained a six and 21 fours in his Test career

 However, the man who was the center of attraction was Hazare, who cracked the classical and orthodox 116, providing some resistance before the Indian lower-order crumpled as his last four batsmen only totaled 20 runs

 The Indians started worse this time around, losing two wickets early on no runs on the board
 yah to tha ki hajaare khelaa ek pari he jo ek samakaleen dainik baat is prakaar banaaya: In fact, the innings was so widely appreciated that everything overshadowed even 201 Bradman

 In an interview with Boria Majumdar in October, noted cricket historian, Hazare claimed that: yah ek avishwasaneey uplabdhi thi, vichaar he ki australia ke gendbaaji akraman lagbhag rup main apni ballebaaji main acha tha
 His bowling lineup boasted a few stellar names: Keith Miller, a genuine all-rounder who was able to give a very good performance with both bat and ball, Ray Lindwal, who was said to possess full ownership of bowling under any circumstances
 , Was one who bowled right, with penetrator and attacking bowling, and Ian Johnson and Bill Johnson, who were both equally important Cogs in the team

 In the process, Hazare would have imitated Bradman, who had done the same in the previous trial

 Officer Hazare gave valuable support and shared a 132-run partnership to the two batsmen, but the end came soon when the Indian tailors succumbed to Lindwal's pace, as the last three wickets fell for six runs

 Bradman's luck with the coin, he won the toss as the toss continued in the series and decided to bat first, winning the toss for the fourth chance out of five

 As usual, Bradman came out to bat at one-down and, along with Bill Brown, added 92 runs for the first third wicket for something unfortunate Australia

 Brown was unaffected by this situation and carved a three-hour-twenty-five minute 99, off 216 balls

 Apart from Torkar, who did not make 56 out, the batsmen did not survive much longer, as India's batting once again turned to a lame performance after a strong revival by Anna Hazare and Mankad

 lekin in khilaadiyon ko samuhik rup se kabhi nahin kiya he, jo tha kya australian team ne kiya

 While Ray Lindwal was the highest wicket taker in the series with 18 wickets
 bharat ke liye vijay hajaare 429 ran banaae or lala amarnath chah pariyon main 13 wicket liye
 However, Amarnath's string of poor scores with the bat cost India the services of another specialist batsman who could have at least reduced the margin of defeat

 In addition, this series also increased the deficit of a bowler in India who can take wickets regularly and control the run-flow
 don breadman ne kaha: It was of the opinion that this side was to play India's strongest, but Rusi Modi, Vijay Merchant, Mushtaq Ali and Fazal Mahmud all missed the tour, which crippled India, because Modi and the businessman on all sorts of pitches and surfaces Was India's most reliable batsman
 unhone yah bhi ek strike gendbaaj he, jo fazal mahmud pakistan ke liye banane ke liye par janaa hoga kho diya he
 Amarnath's lack of success with the bat was a deviation from his performance in the tour, where he has scored 1162 runs at an average of 58
10, and took 30 wickets
