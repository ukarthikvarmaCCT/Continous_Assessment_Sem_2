 The Cauchy Condensation Test in Mathematics, an infinite series named after Augustine Louis Cauchy, is the standard convergence test for one
 dhanatmak hraasmaan anukram f ke liye Is convergent if and only if abhisari he
 Additionally, at this stage ek jyamitiya drishy yah he ki ham prayek 2 n { \ displaystyle 2^{n}} par samalambaabh sahit yoga ko sannikatak karte hai

 We study the range a 1 + a 2 + a 3 + ⋯ { \ displaystyle a_ {1} + a_ {2} + a_ {3} + \ cdots}
 sanghanan pareekshan ke liye shrenee ke vyanjakon ko lambaai 2 n { \ displaystyle 2^{n}} ke samoohon main lene par, ekadishtataa dwaara prayek samooh 2 n a 2 n { \ displaystyle 2^{n}a_{2^{n}}} se kam hoga
 Therefore hamane yahan yah mana he ki anukram an vardhaman nahin he, atah prayek n ≥ m { \ displaystyle n \ geq m} ke liye a n ≤ a m { \ displaystyle a_{n} \ leq a_{m}} 
 Therefore, the convergence of the original series follows a direct comparison to this "condensation" category
 yah dekhne ke liye ki mul shrenee abhisari he jiske parinamswaroop pichhali shrenee bhi abhisari he, atah nimna prakaar maan rakhane par And we again get convergence by direct comparison

 Keep in mind that we have obtained the following values yah pramaan haraatmak shrenee ke apsaran ke oresme pramaan kaa vyapkikaran he
 This generalization is according to Sakalomilk

 This spectrum shows what the temperature of the star is and what chemical elements are present inside it
 adhiktar taron ki varnakram par aadhaarit shreniyon ko angrezi ke O, B, A, F, G, k or m akshar naam ke rup main die gaye hai- Keep in mind that the colors of these stars may seem different from the colors mentioned in their category to a viewer
 taron ke shreneekaran ke liye in aksharon ke saath ek shunya se nau tak kaa ank bhi joda jaataa he jo do aksharon ke antaraal main taare kaa sthaan bataata he
 As such, "A5" is positioned exactly between "A0" and "F0"
 in akshar or ank ke peeche ek roman ank bhi joda jaataa he jo I, II, III, IV yaa v hota he 
 If a star is a Mahadanava, it gets a Roman numeral of I
 III kaa matlab he ke tara ek daanav tara he or v kaa matlab he ke yah ek bouna tara he

 dekha gaya he ke tara jitna nile kii taraf hota jaataa he utana hi garam hota he or utana hi bada hota he
 Shown below is the temperature of stars in different categories and the size and luminosity of our sun
 dhyaan rahe ke yah sirf mukhya anukram ke taron ke liye jaays he - In the period after 1880 AD, scientists working at the observatory of Harvard University made the categories of stars from 'A' to 'O'
 lekin 1920 ke dashak main bhartiya khagolvaigyanik meghnad saaha ne taron ke varnakram or unke satahi taapmaana main sambandh dikhaaya
 As the knowledge in this field grew, scientists changed the categories according to temperature and where the two categories were actually about stars of the same temperature, they were merged to remove one category
 saaha ke or anya vaigyanikon ke adhyayan se yah baat saafe ho gai ke OBAFGKM darasal satahi taapmaana kii shreniyan hai
 In 1943, three scientists working at the Yorkies Observatory created a new grading method for the spectrum of stars
 in vaigyanikon ke naam wiliam wilson morgan, philip si keenan or chhadisso kalman the isliye is pranali ko "MKK" vidhi bhi kaha jaataa he jo inke antim naamon ke pehle angrezi aksharon ko jodakar bana he
 Where Harvard grading runs only according to surface temperature and is used only for dwarf stars, both surface temperature and luminosity are used in the Yerkys grading and all the stars are graded
 daanav taare dravyaman main to boune taron jitna hi hote hai lekin unka vyas boune taron se zyaada hota he
 Therefore, gravity, gas density and pressure on the surface of the demon stars are much lower than the three dwarf stars
 is antar kaa varnakram par kaafii asar dekha ja saktaa he
 Due to the high pressure of the dwarf stars, the spectrum of their spectrum is "spread"

 Actually it is a beautiful pool
 logon main manyata he ki himalay main nivas karne vaale sabhi devi-devtaa yahan har roj praatavkaal snaan hetu aate hai
 Despite being surrounded by forests from all four sides, there is no filth in this pool
 log kehete hai ki jab is kund main pedo kii koi bhi sukhi pattee gir jaati he to yahan par nivas karne vaali pakshiyaan in pattiyon ko apni chonch dwaara baahar nikaal detii hai
 According to public stories, this Kund was built by Balshali Bhima during the Mahabharata period
 kehete hai jab pandav agyatavaas ke samay yahan se guzar rahe the to unhen yahan kaaphi pyaas lag gayi, dur tak kahin bhi pani kaa namonishaan nahin tha
 Then Bhima hit this peak with his mace and built a tank
 isi kund se pyaase pandavon ne apni pyaas bujhaai thi
 For this reason, even today, this pool is seen from a religious point of view
 is kund main snaan karnaa, kuch ched-chhaad karnaa sakht manaa he
 The entire area where this pool is located is called Sukunda
 sukunda ek pahari kii chotii par sthit hone ke kaaran yahan se himalay kii sampoorn parvat shrinkhalaaon ke darshan kiye ja sakate hai
 Kausani and Sukunda, the famous tourist destination of India known as Switzerland, are almost equal in height

 Simplified schematic diagrams have been used
 Compares two voltages and switches its output to indicate which voltage is larger
 Uses negative feedback to invert and amplify a voltage
 Amplifies a voltage The circuit shown is used for finding the difference of two voltages each multiplied by some constant
 The name "differential amplifier" should not be confused with the "differentiator", also shown on this page
 The "instrumentation amplifier", which is also shown on this page, is another form of differential amplifier that also provides high input impedance
 Whenever r 1 = r 2 { \ displaystyle R_{1}=R_{2}} and r f = r g { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{f}}=r_{ \ text{g}}} , When r 1 = r f = r 2 = r g { \ displaystyle R_ {1} = r _ { \ mathrm {f}} = R_ {2} = r _ { \ mathrm {g}}}: Used as a buffer amplifier, to eliminate loading effects or to interface impedances 
 Due to the strong feedback, this circuittends to get unstable when driving a high capacity load
 This can be avoided by connecting the load through aresistor
 a summing amplifer sums several voltages: Integrates the signal over time Differentiates the signal over time
 Combines very high input impedance, high common-mode rejection, low DC offset, and other properties used in making very accurate, low-noise measurements a bistable multivibrator implemented as a comparator with hysteresis
 In this configuration, the hysteresis curve is non-inverting, and the switching thresholds are ± r 1 r 2 v sat { \ displaystyle \ pm { \ frac {R_{1}}{R_{2}}}V_{ \ text{sat}}} where v sat { \ displaystyle V_{ \ text{sat}}} is the greatest output magnitude of the operational amplifier
 Alternatively, the input and the ground may be swapped
 In this configuration, the hysteresis curve is inverting, and the switching thresholds are ± r 1 r 1 + r 2 v sat { \ displaystyle \ pm { \ frac {R_ {1}} {R_ {1} + R_ {2}} } v _ { \ text {sat}}}
 Such a configuration is used in the relaxation oscillator shown below
 By using an RC network to add slow negative feedback to the inverting Schmitt trigger, a relaxation oscillator is formed
 The feedback through the RC network causes the Schmitt trigger output to oscillate in an endless symmetric square wave 
 Simulates an inductor
 Voltage divider reference Creates a resistor having a negative value for any signal generator In general, the components r 1 { \ displaystyle R_{1}}, r 2 { \ displaystyle R_{2}}, and r 3 { \ displaystyle R_{3}} need not be resistors; they can be any component that can be described with an impedance
 Produces a pure sine wave
 Although there are some limitations, this super diode circuit behaves like an ideal diode for the load r l { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{l}}} 
 Note that this implementation does not consider temperature stability and other non-ideal effects
 where i s { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{s}}} is the saturation current
 when the voltage is greater than zero, it can be approximated by: The output voltage is given by: {{infobox Physical quantity | bgcolour = | name = electric charge | image = | caption = | unit = | symbols = q | derivations = q = i · t}} Electric charge is a fundamental property in some subatomic particles that is the importance of electromagnetism

 These rules are used in the decision of such litigants which have an effect on any fact, event or transaction which is related to any other domestic law system in such a way that the adherence to that system is necessary
 Private international law means those Rules that are chosen by a state to decide promises that have a foreign element

 The major topics of international law are as follows: antarrashtriya kanoon ke niyamon kaa sutarapaat vichaarkon kii kalpana tathaa rashtron ke vyavhaaron main hua
 Practices gradually took the form of practices and then those practices became traditions

 The first place in other grounds is that of treaties occurring in different nations, which is in no way less important than traditions
 inke atirikt rajyapatr, pradeshy sansad dwaara sweekrut sanvidhi tathaa pradeshy nyaayalay ke nirnay antarrashtriya kanoon kii anya aadhaar shilaayein hai
 Later, various conventions and the decisions of the Election Court, the Court of International Awards and the Court of International Justice gave international law its present form
 antarrashtriya vidhi katipay kaalpanik tatwon par aadhaarit he jinamein pramukh ye hai: The recognition of international law has always depended on the willingness of the states
 koi aisi vyavastha yaa shakti nahin thi jo rajyon ko antarrashtriya niyamon kaa paalan karne ke liye baadhya kar sake athwa niyambhanjan ke liye dand de sake
 This was the main reason for the failure of the League of Nations
