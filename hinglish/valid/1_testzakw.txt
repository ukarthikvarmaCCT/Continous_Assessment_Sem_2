 Mithila was a kingdom in ancient India
 mana jaataa he ki yah vartmaan uttari bihar or nepal kii tarai kaa ilaaka he jise mithila ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 The folklore of Mithila has been going on for many centuries, which is known for its intellectual tradition outside India and India
 is kshetra kii pramukh bhashaa maithili he
 In Hindu religious texts, the first indication of this is found in Shatapatha Brahmin and explicit mention in Valmiki Ramayana
 mithila kaa ullekh mahabharat, ramayana, puraana tathaa jain evam buddha granthon main hua he
 According to mythological references, Mithila is the most ancient name of this region; Also it has been addressed by the name Videha
 tirbhukti naam praapt ullekhon ke anusaar apekshaakrit kaaphi baad kaa siddh hota he
 The most ancient connection of naming Videha and Mithila connects with Videha Mathava mentioned in Shatapatha Brahmana
 mithila ke basane ke aarambhik samay kaa sanket ukt katha main praapt hota he
 Videgh Mathava and his priest Gautam Rahugan walked east from the arrow of the river Saraswati
 unke aage-aage agni vaishwanar nadiyon kaa jal sukhaate hue chal rahe the
 Agni could not dry the Sadanira river and on being asked by Videgh Mathava where my residence is now, Agni replied that you live on the east side of this river
 shatapath brahman main spasht roopen ullikhit he ki pehle brahman log is nadi ko paar nahin karte the tathaa yahan kii bhoomi upjau nahin thi
 There was a lot of swamp in it because Agni Vishwanar did not taste it
 parantu ab yah bahut upjau he kyonki brahmanon ne yajna karke uskaa aswadan agni ko kara diya he
 It is also mentioned about the Gandaki river that in the later days of summer, that is, during the summer months, this river flows a lot
 is videgh shabd se videh kaa tathaa maathav shabd se mithila kaa sambandh prathit hota he
 In the Shatapath itself, the word Videha is also mentioned explicitly, referring to the Gandaki River
 vahaan kaha gaya he ki ab tak yah nadi kosal or vidah deshon ke bich kii seemaa he; tathaa is bhoomi ko maathav kii santan kaha gaya he
 In Valmiki Ramayana and various Puranas, the name Mithila has been associated with Mithi, son of King Nimi
 newnaadhik antaron ke saath in granthon main ek katha sarvatra praapt he ki nimi ke mrit sharir ke manthan se mithi kaa janm hua tha
 Valmiki Ramayana mentions the descendants of Mithi as Maithil, while in the mythological texts, it is clearly said that Mithila was settled by Mithi
 shabdaantaron se yah baat anek granthon main kahi gayi he ki swatah janm lene ke kaaran unka naam janak hua, videh pita se utpann hone ke kaaran ve vaideh kahalaaye tathaa manthan se utpann hone ke kaaran unka naam mithi hua
 Thus, the name of the state ruled by him has been considered Videha and Mithila
 mahabharat main pradesh kaa naam 'mithila' tathaa iske shaskaon ko 'videhavansheey' kaha gaya he
 Both Mithila and arrowheads have been called in the mithila-mahatmya of the Brihadvishnupurana
 mithi ke naam se mithila tathaa anek nadiyon ke tir par sthit hone se tiron main bhoga hone se tirbhukti naam maane gayi hai
 In this book, the position of the main 15 rivers in Mithila, situated between the Ganges and the Himalayas, has been considered and their names have also been counted
 mithila kaa mahatmaya batalaate hue vrihadvishnu puraana ke mithila-mahatmaya khand main kaha gaya he ki ganga se himalay ke bich 15 nadiyon se yukt param pavitra tirbhukti he
 This arrowhead is Mithila Sita's Nimikanan, the field of knowledge and the back of grace
 janaki ki yah janmabhumi mithila nishpapa or nirpeksha he
 It is pleasing to Rama and Mangaladayini
 prayag aadi tirth lokon main punya dene vaali he parantu ram kii prapti karwaane main samarth nahin he; parantu yah mithila sab prakaar se nishchit rup se ram ko tusht karne vaali hone se vishesh he
 Just as Saket is a form due to the city of the world, similarly Mithila is the cause of all bliss
 isliye maharshigan samast parigrahon ko chhodkar ram kii aradhana ke liye prayatnpurvak yaheen nivas karte hai
 Dev-powers like Srisavitri and Srigauri took this birth
 swayan sarveshvareshvari shrisita ji kii janmabhumi yah mithila ytnpurvak vaas karne se samast siddhiyon ko dene vaali he
 In the Mahabharata, the position of Mithila has been considered after Magadha
 shrikrishna, arjuna tathaa bhim kii magadh-yatra kaa varnan karte hue pehle sarayu nadi paar karke purvi koshal pradesh tathaa phir mahashon, gandki tathaa sadanira ko paar karke mithila main jane kaa ullekh hua he
 It is said that once again crossing the Ganges and the Mahashon to Magadha
 isse spasht prathit hota he ki us samay magadh ke uttar main mithila kii hi sthiti maani gayi he
 The kingdom of Vajji was included only under Mithila
 mahabharat ke is ullekh main bhi mithila ke seemaa kshetra ke bare main anyatra ullikhit pashchim main gandaki tathaa dakshin main ganga tak ke kshetra yathavat sanketit hote hai
 Mentioning the boundary of Mithila in the Brihadvishnupurana clearly states that- arthath purv main kosi se aarambh hokar pashchim main gandaki tak 24 yojan tathaa dakshin main ganga nadi se aarambh hokar uttar main himalay van tak 16 yojan mithila kaa vistaar he
 Mahakavi Chanda Jha has written the above mentioned verses as Maithili, while explaining the extent of Mithila
 is prakaar ullikhit seemaa ke antargat vartmaan main nepal ke tarai pradesh ke saath bihar rajya ke pashchimi champaran, purvi champaran, shivahar, sitamarhi, mujffarpur, vaishali, samastipur, begusarai, darbhanga, madhubani, supaul, madhepura, saharsa, or khagadiya jile kaa praayah puraa bhubhag tathaa bhagalpur jile kaa aanshik bhubhag aata he
 This range is according to ancient mentions, possibly due to the immense fame and uncontrolled spread of Kosi, the eastern border has been considered as Kosi
 band banane se purv kosi kaa koi niyat maarg nahin rahaa he
 Koshi is a book from all areas of eastern Bihar
 atah mahananda nadi se pashchim arthath pashchim bengal aarambh hone se pehle kaa puraa purvi bihar mithilanchal kaa hi swaabhaavik bhaag rahaa he
 The state of the 15 major rivers under Mithila, situated between the Ganges and the Himalayas, has been reported in the Vriddhivasupurana
 unke naam is prakaar hai:- These are the names of the relatively larger rivers then; But in addition to these, many small rivers in Mithilanchal flow continuously from ancient times till today and are making the name of 'mithila' arrowhead
 shriram-sita se sambandhit vishesh sthaan hone ke atirikt mithila devadhidev mahadev ke pujan-sthal ke rup main vishesh prasiddh rahi he
 According to the great Vishnupuran, the names of the major Shivalingas herein are as follows: - mithila parikrama ke kram main simavarti shivlingon kaa ullekh karte hue singheshwar mahadev tathaa kameshwar ling kaa naam atyadhik shraddha purvak liya gaya he
 Thus the names of the eleventh Shivlingas are enumerated here
 purv main singheshwar mahadev ko pranaam kar parikrama aarambh karne tathaa punah ghumkar singheshwar mahadev ke paas pahunchakar niyam-vidhi purna karke hi ghar jane kii baat kahi gayi he
 • Janakpur palpa jila nepal ke pashchimanchal vikaas kshetra ke lumbini anchal main sthit ek atyaadhik urvar evam ghanaa vasti sameta huwa jila hai
 The area of this district is 1373 burg km and population is 3 lakh

 Along with Guru, he reached Delhi from Multan and started spending time in meditation of God
 dehali main shiksha diksha puri karne ke uparaant baba farid ne 19-20 varsh tak hisar jile ke haansi naamak kasbe main nivas kiya
 After the death of Sheikh Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki, he was appointed Khalifa, but the life of the capital was not favorable to his quiet nature, so after a few days, he was first alone in Hansi, then Khotwal, and then some 28 miles south west of Deepalpur Ajodhan

 It is said that Baba also translated Jika in Hindi for his disciples

 112 'salok' of Sheikh Farid is quoted in Guru Granth Sahab
 yadhyapi vishay vahi he jinpar baba praaia: vaartalap kiya karte the, tathaapi ve baba farid ke kisi chele kii, jo baba nanak ke sampark main aayaa, rachana gyaat hote hai
 Similarly, texts like Favaubussalekin, Asrarukh Auliya and Rahatul Kulap are also not the works of Baba Farid
 baba farid ke shishyon main nizamuddin auliya ko atyadhik prasiddhi praapt hui
 In fact, due to the spiritual and moral influence of Baba Farid, his contemporaries had great facility in explaining Islam

 isane isapurv 230 se lekar duusari sadi tak kendriya dakshin bharat par raaj kiya
 It became powerful after the fall of the Maurya dynasty
 inkaa ullekh 8veen sadi isapurv main miltaa he
 After Ashoka's death, the Satavahanas declared themselves independent
 sise kaa sikaa chalaane vaala pehla vansh satvaahan vansh tha, or vah sise kaa sikaa rome se laayaa jaataa tha
 For the first time in ancient India, under the Maurya dynasty, we tried to establish political and cultural unity
 baad main chalakar satvaahan vansh ne is prayaas ko aage badhaayaa
 Although historians Satavahanas are the successors of the Mauryas in the Deccan, the rise of this dynasty should also be understood as a normal Jain and Hindu process against the Buddhist kingdom of Ashoka
 satvaahan vansh kii sthapana maury vansh ke paraabhav se lagbhag pachaas varsh pehle hui
 His empire was the oldest and largest empire in South India
 uttar bharat nirantar badalte rajvansheey paridrishy ke viparit satvahanon ne dakkan main atoot, avibhajya tathaa dirghakaal tak sthai rup se chalane vaale ek samrajya kii sthapana kii jisane lagbhag saadhe chaar sau varshon tak shashan kiya
 From the information we have received about this period, we get to know about the singularities of the Satavahanas and their unique activities in different fields
 yadi puraanon ke vaktavyon par vishvas kiya jaae to dakkan ke is samrajya kii simaaen uttar bharat tak faili hui thi
 Magadha was a part of this empire, also spread over southern India and its boundaries were wide from eastern to western sea
 uttar tathaa dakshin bharat kii maalav, bhoj, pathnik, rathik, andhra, parind tathaa dravid aadi vibhinn prakaar kii prajatiyon ke samanvay se is samrajya kaa nirmaan hua tha tathaa is drushti se kshetrafal main maury samrajya se kam hote hue bhi satvaahan samrajya usase kahin adhik sugathit tha
 It was a result of the long and peaceful rule given by the Satavahanas in Central India and Deccan that the art and architecture developed, examples of which we can find in the sculpted cavities in the rocks of western India and the stupas and viharas of eastern India
 is kaal main samskruti kaa bhi atyadhik vikaas hua tathaa prakrut bhashaa kaa aakarshan rajdarbaron tak pahunchaa
 Although the Satavahana kingdom was a Hindu kingdom, Buddhism developed uniquely under them
 vyapaar, vaanijya evam jal parivahan ke kshetron main bhi atyaadhik unnati hui
 There is a complete lack of information and sources giving information about the Satavahanas
 unase sambandhit shilalekhon kii sankhya bahut kam he or is prastut shilalekhon main die gaye sandarbhon main bhi satvahanon ke vishay main purna jaankaree nahi milti
 About them we have only nineteen inscriptions from the eastern Deccan
 jo is vansh ke tees raajaaon tathaa saadhe chaar sau varshon ke lambe shashan kaal ke vishay main jaankaree dene ke liye kisi bhi drushtikon se prayog nahi he
 Although the Archaeological Department carried out excavations at Paithan, Maski and Pondapur in the ancient Hyderabad state, but no more evidence was found from here
 is vishay main satvaahan vashan ke raajaaon dwaara prachlit sikke jo purvi tathaa pashchimi dakkan evam madhya pradesh se mili hai, se hamen is vansh ke vishay main mahatvapurn jaankaree milti he
 Scholars like Thomas, Rapson, Cunningham, Bhagwan Lal Indra Ji and Scott have received important information from these coins
 parantu in sikkon ke bhangit tathaa kuch sikkon ke jaali hone ke kaaran kai vivaad uth khadey hue hai
 Literary sources have disappointed even more in this subject
 moulik puraanon main kaalaantar main jude ansho ke kaaran inamen satvahanon ke vishay main di gai suchanaaen ab vishwasaneey nahi rah gai hai
 Also, the situation has become even more suspicious in the various Puranas due to the absence of death in the context of the Satavahanas
 yadhyapi gunadhay dwaara rachit brihad katha ko satvaahan rajya sangrakshan main likhaa hua mana jaataa he tathaapi yah kriti ab mul rup main nahi milti tathaa i par aadhaarit uske baad ke sanskarnon main di gai soochnaaon kii vyavastha vibhinn vidwaanon alag-alag kii he
 Similarly, Lilavati, which is related to the military campaigns and victories of the Satavahana ruler period, cannot be overstated
 is karanvash satvaahan kaal ke vishay main abhi hamaari jaankaree simit he
 There are profound differences among various scholars regarding the emergence of Satavahanas and their original place of residence
 shilaalekh tathaa sikkon main varnit satvaahan or shatakarni shaskaon ko puraanon main andhra, andhra-mrity tathaa andhra jaateey naamon se pukaara gaya he
 On this basis, scholars have reached the decision that Satavahana or Shatakarani kings were equivalent to Andhra
 rapasan, smith tathaa bhandarkar ke anusaar satvaahan shaasha andhra desh se sambandhit the
 About the Andhra people, the Puranas say that they were residents of the ancient Telugu region which was situated in the middle of the Godavari and Krishna river
 etrey brahman main unka ullekh aisi jati ke rup main hua he jo aaryon ke prabhaav se mukt thi
 In Indica, Magasthenes mentioned their power and prosperity

 But what happened to them after the fall of the Maurya Empire is not known
 sambhavtah unhonn apane aapako swatantra ghashit kar diya
 Although the historians mentioned above consider Andhra Pradesh as the original abode of the Satavahanas, there are differences among these scholars regarding the center of their power
 jahaan smith shri kakulam ko satvahanon athwa andhron kii rajdhani maanate hai
 But scholars have differences regarding the relationship with Satavahanas
 samvaahan vansh ke shilalekhon main i kaal ke shaskaon ko nirantar rup se satvaahan athwa shatakarni kaha gaya he
 In the literary texts, the term Shali Vahan is also used for them
 parantu is sandarbh main andhra shabd kaa prayog is vansh ke kisi bhi shilaalekh main nahi he
 On the other hand, western India has been considered as their original place of residence on the basis of inscriptions, coins and literary sources
 is tathy kaa pramaan nanaghat tathaa saachin ke aarmabhik shilalekhon se bhi miltaa he
 On this basis, Dr
 Gopalachari has considered the original residence of the Satavahanas of the establishment and its surrounding area
 iske atirikt ve0es0 sukuthankar ne bellari jile ko; ech0si0raay0 choudhary ne anya desh ke dakshini hisse ko tathaa ve0ve0 mirashi ne wain ganga nadi ke donon kinaaron se lage baraar pradesh ko satvahanon kaa mul nivas sthaan mana he
 On this basis, the equivalence and homogeneity of Satavahanas and Andhra is doubtful
 is vishay main vidwaanon ne yah sujhaayaa he ki satvahanon ne apane aarmabhik jivan kii dakkan se shuruyaat kii tathaa kuch hi samay main andhra pradesh ko bhi jeet liya
 Later, when the western and northern regions of the Satavahana kingdom continued to pass through their hands due to suspicion and rich invasions, their power was probably limited to the central region between Godavari and Krishna river i
e
andhra Pradesh and now Satavahanas came to be known as Andhra
 
 satvahanon kii utpati ke vishay main bhi hamen jaankaree nahi he
 Some scholars have compared him to the Satyaputras mentioned in the inscriptions of Ashoka and some to the Setai described by Pliny
 kuch anya vidwaanon ne shabd bhasha vigyaan ke aadhaar par shatakarni tathaa satvaahan shabdon ko paribhaashit kiya he chaahe in shabdon kii mahatta kuch bhi rahi ho parantu satvaahan vansh ke shilalekhon ke aadhaar par yah lagbhag nishchit he ki satvaahan bhi shunga tathaa kanv shaskaon kii tarah brahman the
 The proof of this is also found in the Nasik inscription, in which Gautami's son Shri Shatkarni has been decorated as a Brahmin and Khatiyya-swa-man-madan, ie, a man who marshals of Kshatriyas, etc
 isi shilaalekh ke lekhak ne gautamiputra kii tulana parashuram se kii he
 In addition, in the Datrishatputlika also, the Shalivahanas are said to have originated from mixed Brahmin caste and Nagajati
 satvahanon ke kalkram ko lekar vidwaanon main gahare matbhed hai
 The Aitreya Brahmana, which was written in 500 BC, mentions the bandits who were outside the Arya Periphery and who were the descendants of Vishwamitra
 is aadhaar par dody0aar0 bhandarkar ne 500 i0purv ko satvahanon kii aarmabhik sthiti mana he
 According to Dr
 V
 A
 Smith, Andhra was subordinate at first, but after his death he became independent under the leadership of Simukh and this incident happened in the third century BCE
 is vishay main smith ne puraanon kaa hi aadhaar mana he jinke anusaar andhron ke kul tees shaskaon ne lagbhag 460varshon tak shashan kiya
 Dr
 Gopalachari also accepted this fact by acknowledging that the Satavahana dynasty was founded around 235 AD and its fall in about 255 AD
 kaling ke shaasha kharkhel ke rajyakaal main utkeern hathi gumpha shilaalekh ke aadhaar par rapasan satvaahan vansh kaa armbh 220 i0purv tathaa 211 i0purv ke bich maanate he parantu satvahanon ke yasana kaal ko lekar vibhinn puraanon main bhi mataantar he
 On one hand, where the Matsya Purana states their total Yasan period is 460 years, on the other hand, in Brahmapuran this period is stated to be 456 years
 vayupurana ke anusaar satvahanon ne 411 varshon tak shashan kiya jabaki vishnupurana unki shashan avadhi 300 varsh maanata he
 The second R

 Bhandarkar considers the establishment of the Satavahana dynasty as early as 72

 puraanon main varnit ek vaktavy ke aadhaar par unhone yah mana he ki, ‘‘shunga mrity’’ kanv shaasha shunga shaskaon ke sevak the tathaa peshwaon kii bhaanti unke saath-saath shashan karte the tathaa simuk athwa shishuk naamak satvaahan vansh ke sansthaapak ne kanv raja sushraman ko markar kanv tathaa shunga dono vansho kaa ant kar diya tathaa unke samrajya ko apane aadhin kar liya
 But this fact is unbelievable because we know very well that the rulers of Sunga and Kanva dynasty never ruled jointly and Vasudeva Kanva, the founder of Kanva dynasty, took over the reins of the reign by killing the last Sunga ruler Devbhuti
 vayupurana ke us vaktavy jiske aadhaar par dobhandarkar ne galat vyakhya kii he, ko doray choudhary ne sahi bhang se paribhaashit kiya he
 According to him, this dirty volume tells this much that when Simuk ended the Kanva dynasty and established the Satavahana dynasty, he also abolished the Sunga rulers who remained after the defeat of the Sunga rulers at the hands of the Kanva dynasty
 
 atev satvaahan shaskaon ne 29 i0purv main kanv vansh kaa ant kar swayan shashan kii bagdor sanbhali
 But notwithstanding all these factors one cannot deny the possibility that Simuk, who ruled for 23 years, would have been enthroned sometime back i
e
 in the middle of the first century BCE
 simuk satvaahan vansh kaa sansthaapak tha tathaa usne 235 i0pus0 se lekar 212i0pus0 tak lagbhag 23 varshon tak shashan kiya
 Although we do not get much information about it, it is known from the Puranas that by destroying the power of the Kanva rulers and suppressing the remaining Sunga chiefs, he laid the foundation of the Satavahana dynasty
 puraanon main use simec ke atirikt shishuk, sindhuk tathaa shiprak aadi naamon se bhi pukaara gaya he
 According to Jain observers, Simuk built Jain and Buddhist temples during his reign, but at the end of his reign, he was stunned and cruel due to which he was removed and murdered
 simuk kii mrityu ke pashchaat uskaa chota bhai kanha rajgaddi par baitha
 During his 18-year tenure, Kanha adopted the policy of empire expansion
 nasik ke shilaalekh se yah pataa chalata he ki kanha ke samay main satvaahan samrajya pashchim main nasik tak fail gaya tha
 After shatkarni-i Kanha, Shatkarni ascended the first throne
 puraanon ke anusaar vah kanha putr tha
 But Dr
 Gopalachari considers Simuk as the father of Shatkarni I
 kuch vidwaanon ne yah mana he ki iskaa shashan kaal maatra do varsh rahaa parantu nilkantha shastri ne uskaa shashan kaal 194 i0pus0 se lekar 185 i0pus0 mana he
 However, it is clear that his reign was not very long
 parantu chota hote hue bhi shatakarni pratham kaa kaarykaal kuch drushtikonon se bada mahatvapurn he
 He was the first among the Satavahana rulers who named him by the word "shatkarni", beloved and popular among the rulers of this dynasty
 nanaghat shilaalekh ke anusaar shatakarni ne apane samrajya kaa khub vistaar kiya tathaa apane kaary kaal main do ashwamegh yajna tathaa ek rajasuy yajna kiya
 From an inscription of her queen Nayanika, we learn that Shatkarni i conquered western Malwa as well as Anup and Vidarbha regions
 yadi shatakarni pratham hi vah shaasha he jiskaa ullekh sanchi stupa ke torana main hua he to yah bhi is baat ko pramanit karata he ki uske samay main madhya bharat satvahanon ke adhikaar main tha
 He became the emperor during his work with his umbrellas and he took the titles like Dakshin Pathapati and the Untamed Chakra etc
 nanaghat lekh tathaa hathi gumpha lekhon main prayukt lipi kii samanta ke aadhaar par hi yah sujhaayaa gaya he ki kadaachit isi shatakarni shaskaon ke shashan kaal ke duusare varsh main kaling ke mahaan shaasha kharkhel ne yuddh kshetra main haraaya tha
 Shatkarni I's wife Nayanika or Naganika was the daughter of a maestro, Tranakairo, of Angiyan clan
 shatakarni pratham kii mrityu ke pashchaat uske do alpavyask putr vedashri tathaa satshri singhaasana par baithe
 But being a minor, the administration took the reins of his mother Nayanika, who ruled with the help of her father
 aisa prathit hota he ki vedashri kii alpaayu main hi mrityu ho gai tathaa satshri ne uske uttaradhikari ke rup main shashan sambhala
 But the Puranas are unanimous that after Satakarni I, a king named Purnotsang sat on the throne Satavahana
 chaahe chaturth satvaahan shaasha kaa naam kuch bhi rahaa ho, yah to nishchit he ki is shaasha ke shashan kaal main hi pushyamitra shunga ne antim maury shaasha brahadrath ko maar kar magadh rajya par adhikaar kar liya tha
 In Matsyapuran, Skandastambhi is mentioned as the fifth ruler of the Satavahana dynasty but most scholars consider this name to be fictitious
 shatakarni dwitiya ne lagbhag 166 i0pus0 se lekar 111 i0pus0 tak shashan kiya
 It was probably the same ruler who is mentioned in the inscriptions Heathigumpha and Bhilsa
 yah prathit hota he ki iske shashan kaal main satvahanon ne purvi malwa ko pushyamitra shunga ke ek uttaradhikari se chin liya
 According to the Puranas, after Shatkarni II, Lambodar ascended the throne
 lambodar ke pashchaat uskaa putr apilak gaddi par baitha
 Appellant who was the eighth Satavahana ruler, the period between these two is considered to be the dark age in the context of Satavahanas in which only the period of Kuntal Shatakarni can be considered as an exception
 kuntal shatakarni, apilak ke pashchaat satvahanon kaa aglaa mahatvapurn shaasha tha
 In the Kamasutra, Vatsyayan mentions Kuntal Shatkarni, writing that he used his fingers as a scissor and that his patrani Malayavati died from the stroke
 kawyaminmasha main rajeshwar ne kuntal shatakarni kaa varnan karte hue kaha he ki usne apane ranivas main rahane vaali apni raniyon ko yah aadesh diya tha ki ve keval praakrit bhashaa kaa prayog karen
 Hall was the next important ruler of the Satavahanas
 yadhyapi usne keval chaar varsh hi shashan kiya tathaapi kuch vishyon uskaa shashan kaal bahut mahatvapurn rahaa
 It is believed that if Shatkarni was the greatest as the first warrior among the early Satavahana rulers, Hall was a pioneer as a peacekeeper
 haal saahitiyik abhiruchi bhi rakhata tha tathaa ek kavi samraat ke rup main prakhyat hua
 His name is mentioned in the Puranas, Lilavati, Saptashati, Abhidhan Chintamani etc
 yah mana jaataa he ki praakrit bhashaa main likhi gaatha saptshati athwa satsai kaa rachiyata haal hi tha
 Gunadhya, the author of Brihatkatha, was also a recent contemporary and probably composed this book written in Paisachi language under his recent patronage

 haal ne prayaas kar leelavati se vivaah kar liya
 Legend has it that some military operations were carried out in the eastern Deccan, but due to lack of evidence, most scholars consider it wrong
 yadhyapi haal tak ke satvaahan shaskaon ke shasankaal main rajnatik kshetra ke atirikt saahitiyik tathaa aarthik kshetron main bhi atyaadhik vikaas hua tathaa vyapaar-vaanijya shaharon ke vikaas evam jalaparivahan kii unnati hui jo ki pratham shatabdi i0 ke duusare mundalak athwa puridransen ke shashan kaal main apane utkarsh kii paraakaashtha par pahunch gai, tathaapi aane vaale lagbhag pachaas varsh satvaahan samrajya ke liye bade hi kathin sabit hue
 It seemed as if the Satavahana Empire was about to collapse with the foreign invasion of the West Satraps

 The Western Kshatrapas of the Kshatra dynasty had established themselves in Paschima Rajputana, Gujarat and Kathiawar
 in shaq shaskaon ne 35 i0 se lekar lagbhag 90i0 tak satvaahan rajya par akraman kiye
 He conquered the eastern and Paiyachma Malwa territories by the Satavahanas; Northern Konkan also dominated northern Maharashtra, which was the center of the Satavahana power and extended to southern Banavasi
 kshahraat vansh kaa pehla shaasha ghumak tha jisaki jaankaree ke strot kuch sikken he jo ki adhikanshtah gujarat kathiyawad ke tateey pradesh tathaa yadakada malwa se paae hai
 Ghoomak's successor was Nahapan, whose information we hold on his majority of coins is the title of king
 vahiin shilalekhon uski oopaadhi kshatrap tathaa mahakshatrap mili
 His inscriptions of Nashik, Karle and Junar; All of the donations made by SK majority coins and his Jamta Shak Ashwadat in northern and southern India testify that the empire of the Kshatra dynasty was very vast at the time of Nahapan and that it had taken away a large territory from the Satavahana rulers
 Was made so huge

 The Satavahana kings who were defeated at the hands of Nahapan were probably the beautiful Shatakarni, Chakor Shatkarni and Sivasati, whose tenure was very short, but this situation did not last long and as the Satavahana ruler of Gautami son Sri Shatakarni became the new ruler in this quasi-satavahana struggle Turned
 lagbhag aadhi shatabdi kii uthapatak tathaa shaq shaskaon ke haathon manamardan ke baad gautami putr shri shatakarni ke netritv main apni khoi hui pratishtha ko purnsthapit kar liya
 Gautami's son Sri Shatkarni was the greatest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty, who ruled for nearly 25 years, not only restored the lost prestige of his empire but also established a vast empire
 gautami putr ke samay tathaa uski vijayon ke baaren main hamen uski mata gautami balashri ke nasik shilalekhon se sampoorn jaankaree milti he
 Gautamiputra Satkarni is also considered by some experts to be King Shalivahana
 unhone puure bharat ko ekajute kar diya or videshi hamalaavaron ke khilaaf bachaaya
 In this context, we get information from this article that he has made the ego of Kshatriyas honorable
 uskaa varnan shaq, yavan tathaa pehlaav shasaskon ke vinaash karta ke rup main hua he
 His greatest achievement was the defeat of Shaka ruler Nahapan of the Kshatra dynasty and his descendants at his hands
 jogalthambi samuh se praapt nahpaan ke chandi ke sikken jinhe ki gautami putr shatakarni ne dubaara dhalvaaya tathaa apane shashan kaal ke atharahawein varsh main gautami putr dwaara nasik ke nikat pandu-len main guhaadaan karnaa- ye kuch aise tathy he jon yah pramanit karaten he ki usne shaq shaskaon dwaara chhine gaye pradeshon ko purnvijit kar liya
 His war with Nahapan took place in the 17th and 18th years of his reign, and after winning this war, the son of Gagatami abducted, Anoop, Saurashtra, Kukar, Akar and Avanti from being drunk
 in kshetron ke atirikt gautami putr kaa rishik, ayamak, mulak tathaa vidarbha aadi pradeshon par bhi adhipaty tha
 The area under its direct influence extended from Malwa and Kathiawar in the north to the Krishna River in the south and from Berar in Puwa to Konkan in the west

 It seems that shortly before his death, the territories won by Gautami's son Shatkarni defeated Nahapan and passed away
 gautami putr se in pradeshon ko chhinane vaale sambhawatah sithian jati ke hi karadaamak vansh ke shaq shaasha the
 We find evidence of this by Talmi from his book describing geography
 aisa hi nishkarsh 150 i0 ke prasiddh rudradaman ke junagarh ke shilaalekh se bhi nikaala ja saktaa he
 This inscription shows that Rudradaman captured all the territories of Gautamiputra Shatkarni, who had been conquered by Nahapan
 aisa prathit hota he ki gautamiputra shatakarni ne karadaamak shakon se vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kar rudradaman dwaara hathiyaae gaye apane kshetron ko surakshit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 According to Devism or Neutralism, intellect is the main weapon and ultimate authority in the search for truth

 This claim has been a subject of controversy especially in the areas of religion and knowledge

 madhya yug ke samay, vlad tepes vailechia or tronsilvenia kaa shahjada hota tha
 In his childhood, he is imprisoned on behalf of the Ottoman Empire like the royal princes, training him as a soldier to be restored to the Sultan's Janissary army, who later becomes a brave warrior
 apane kai hajaar dushmano ko bhaale kii nonk par maut ke ghat utaar unhen khule maidan main khadaa kar dene baad use vladdi impeler kii oopaadhi di jaati he
 Although he is irritated by these bloodshed, he tries to set himself back to get rid of these bad days
 ek din jangalon main, vlad or uske sipaahiyon ko jharne ke paas ek helmet miltaa he
 Fearing that the search engines of the Ottoman might be on the way, they go through the waterfalls and reach a cave at the height of a hill called "broken Tooth"
 jyon hi vah log gupha ke bheetar daakhil hote hai, vahaan zamin par kaaleen kii tarah bichhe kai kuchli hui haddiyon kaa dher miltaa he; or achaanak hi andhere main koi anjaan praani unpar hamalaa kar daalata hai jisaki laal surkh ankhen hai, jisamen insaanon se kai zyada bemisaal furti or takat he
 Many of Vlad's companions are killed, then he injures the shadow with a sword lying in the cave
 jis talwaar se vlad ne us praani ko kaata to dhoop main uske lahu ke tarah vah bhi ghulne lagata he or ab to vah bhi gupha ke muhane par pad rahi dhoop ke kaaran vlad kaa peechha chhod detii he
 Upon his return to the fort, Wlad discovers from a local monk that the creature is actually a vampire, a man who was once summoned by the Devil from the depths of Hell, and the Devil moves on before handing over his black powers as a settlement
 While cursing to remain forever in the cave, he says, now he will be released when someone drinks his blood, after that he drinks the blood of another human being
 vahaan lagbhag har shaks kaa swaagat he jo takat ke badale main use gupha se nikaalane kii aazaadee bhi dilaae
 The next day, when Vlad is enjoying his wife Mirrena, and son Ingeras, and his subjects at Ester's feast, the military contingent of the automaker suddenly arrives at the fort there
 vlad unhen bataur khidamat main chaandi ke sikkon kaa inaam pesh karata he, lekin doot ke mutabik automan kii palaton se kai sipaahi laapata he, andaja he ki vlad ne un sabko maar daalaa hoga
 Vlad denies the matter of killing anyone while boasting
 phir to doot us khidamat ke inaam ke saath 1,000 ladakon kii maang rakhata he jinhen jainisairi kii talim dekar, aage sultanate kaayam karne laayak taiyaar kiya ja sake
 Vlad disapproves of this, but gets into trouble when the army is not less in number and equal to the Turks
 mirena ko iskaa bharosa rahata he, chunki vlad or mehmed donon bachapan ke dinon main, sage bhaiyon kii tarah rahen hai, to is maamle par baat karne kii salaah detii he, taaki shaayad mehmed unhen raham baksh de
 Appearing in front of Mehmed II, he expresses his inability to give more children to the country
 masale kii naakaami dekh, bacchon ke badale vah khud ko pesh karne kii koshish karata he; lekin sultan ise inkaarta he or vlad ke bete ko saunpane kii maang rakhata he
 The Sultan then sends his messenger to bring Vlad's son
 vlad is masale par apni bivi se yah kahata he, ki vah apane bete saath doot or otoman ke sipaahiyon se milane ja rahaa he
 Vlad then assures Mirena that he goes to meet the messenger and his soldiers in private before leaving her and the children
 nihathe jate dekh; ingerais ghabaraakar, uske peeche padakar, uskaa haath pakadta he or apane pita se sultan kii fouj main bhartee hone ko manjuuri kii baat kahata he
 As Vlad approaches the Turkish envoy, smiling, Vlad regrets having some trouble with him
 vlad apane bete ko maa kii ore bhaagane kahata he, or phir doot kii talwaar chhinte hue use or use ghere sipaahiyon ko maar daalata he
 Then knowing that he must fight the war, Vlad needs help from the vampire who returns to the mountain with his "broken Tooth"
 phir ek dhakelte hue, vah pishaach uske lautne kii vajah puchhata he
 In response, Vlad speaks of defeating the Ottoman army on the strength of his vampire powers
 phir vah pishaach iske nattejey ke bare main bataata he, or use apana khun detaa, jo vlad ko asthaayee taur par pishaach kii shaktiyaan pradaan kar sakati he
 It warns him that he will have to overcome the discomfort of drinking human blood within three days, only then can he return to human form
 anyathaa, vah hameshaa ke liye ek pishaach banakar rah jayega or ek din use apane hi rachayita se madad kii guhaar kerani padagi
 Vlad accepts the offer and drinks the blood of a vampire, with which he undergoes traumatic and deathly convictions
 jaagane par khud ko jangal main paane baad, vlad ko mahasoos hota he ki uski indriya shaktiyaan pehle se kaaphi bad chuki he, takat or teji main insaanon se kahin zyada, yahaan tak kii vah khud ko chamagaadadon kii oot main bhi badal saktaa tha; par uski twachaa sidhi dhoop main jhulas padati he
 When he returns to Cassell Dracula, the Ottoman army is attacked, but Vlad breaks into them alone and kills everyone
 phir kile main maujuud apni prajaaon ko kosia ke math par bhej detaa he, joki pahaado ke kinare hi basaa he, jahaan unhen mahfuj rahane laayak panaah mil saken
 During this journey, Mirena comes to know of Vlad's curse when Vlad is weakening himself by pressing a silver coin so as not to attack the ignorant people for drinking his blood
 iske baad vlad kasam khaataa he ki vah insaani khun se khud ko parhez karegaa, vah raji ho jaati he ki vah dubaara amarta paa legaa taaki otoman ko haraa sake
 But a Romney named Schkelgim, discovering Vlad's vampire, asks him to drink his own blood as a servant to substantiate this claim; But Vlad denies it
 jyon hi ve log math ke najadik pahonchte, dhaat lagaae baithe otoman ke sipaahi vailaah par tut padate he; or jab tak vlad or unke aadmi peeche hatane main kaamyaab hote, vlad kii is achaanak ai amanviya takat se uske praja main andeh yakeen main badal jaataa he
 The next day in the monastery, as soon as the monk discovers the curse, he pits the prince and his subjects against Vlaed, for which he is trapped in a sun-burnt house
 par dhuen kii kaalikh se suraj dhap jaataa he, jisase vlad aag se batch nikalataa he or gusse main apane pishaach banane kii vajah sirf apane logon ko otoman ke hukumat se bachaana tha
 Before impulsively doing something against him, Mirena asks him to stop and calm down
 usee raat, otoman kii sainik juluus math kii ore badhata he
 Vlad repels them with a large swarm of bats, although those soldiers were already lured, a handful of them entered the Turkish soldiers' monastery, and led several of the inhabitants to Ingeras
 is
 mirena apane bete ko bachaane kii koshish karti he, or math kinare kii unchi diwaar se gir jaati he
 Dying, Mirena would plead with Vlad to drink his blood before the sun rises, which would give him the strength to save his son
 vlad ko anichhaa se uskaa lahu pinaa padataa he, jiske parinaam par aakhirkaar vah ek purna pishaach banataa he or jiske saath hi uski shaktiyaan pehle kaaphi zyada bad jaati he
 Vlad returns to the monastery and attacks him like a vampire, confronting the guards sitting there
 vahiin otoman kii sainya chhavnee par, mehmed apni europe kii vishaal fouj ke saath hamale kii taiyaari main rahata he
 After seeing Vlad and his vampire army slaughtered, the Ottoman soldiers are horrified, in the meantime, Wlad himself appears in front of Mehmed, who had kept Ingeras in captivity
 pehle se hi chaukas ki pishaach kii shakti chaandi ke kaaran ksheen pad jaati he, mehmed chhavnee kii farsh par bichhe kaaleen hataate hue sabhi chaandi ke sikkon ko saamne laata he,jisase vlad kii takat or gati tham jaati he, or tab uski asaavadhaanee kaa laabh uthaakar apni chaandi kii talwaar ke dam par vlad se bhid jaataa he
 As he dominates Vlad, the earlier arrangement tries to pierce his heart with a wooden stick, but Vlad escapes by turning him into a swarm of bats, then taking the name of "dracula, the son of the devil", to Mehmed with the same opening Kills and drinks his blood, Vlad knocks at his cruelty arising from this animal state
 jaise hi vah mehmed kii chhavnee se baahar aate, drakula or ingerais ko duusare pishaach ban chuke log unhen gherkar, or uske bete ko uske insaan hone kaaran unhen saunpkar maar daalane ko dhamkaate he
 Then the same monk comes in who pits the people of Vailah against Vlad and now holds a cross to repel those vampires
 tabhi unamem se ek pishaach jab ingerais par jhapatata he, drakula use bhaale se pewast kar uske bete ko nuksaan naa pahunchaane ko aagaah karata he
 Dracula orders the monk to remove Ingeras, then removes the clouds over the sky with his powers
 suraj kii roshni main saare pishaach dhul main mil jate hai, tab tak drakula bhi jali laash kii tarah dharashayi ho jaataa he
 Vlad is presumed dead and Europe survives the Ottoman attack, with Ingeras being crowned as the new Prince of Valechia
 haalaanki, shkelgim chori chupe drakula ke parthiv sharir ko najdiki chhavnee main laakar use apana khun chadhaakar punerjeevit karata he
 Then in the present day, Vlad meets a woman named Mina on the street of this modern city, which reminds him of Mirena, and in conversation he repeats the lines of the poem that are between them
 vahiin vlad ko shaapit karne vaala pishaach bhi, saamaanya insaanon kii tarah ab jivit dikhaai padataa he, apane se dur jate dekh unke peeche chal padataa he, or pehle se rache yojana main drakula ke bhavishya ke bare main kahata he, "to phir tamaasha shuru kiya jaae !"

 ganit main, 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ··· ek anant shrenee he jiske vyanjak krmanugat dhanatmak sankhyaayein hoti hai jiske ekantar chihn hote hai arthath prayek vyanjak ke chihn, iske purv vyanjak se vipareet hote hai
 The sum of the first m terms of the category can be written with the help of sigma sum representation: anant shrenee ke apsaran kaa matlab yah he ki iske aanshik yoga kaa anukram kisi parimit maan kii ore agrasar nahin hota he
 However, in the mid-18th century, Leonard Eiler wrote in a contradictory equation: lekin is sameekaran kii sarthakata bahut samay baad tak spasht nahin ho pai
 In the first half of the 1980s, Ernesto Sissera, Emil Borel and others provided a well-defined method for assigning broad totals to divergent categories — including new euler methods
 inamen se vibhinn sankalaniyata vidhiyon dwaara 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 kaa "yoga" 1⁄4 likhaa ja saktaa he
 Sisera-compilation is one of those methods that cannot achieve the sum of 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


, so the range is an example that requires a slightly stronger method such as the Abel compile method
 shrenee 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


, grandi shrenee 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 


 se atisambaddh he
 Eiler studied these two categories as a special state of the range 1 - 2n + 3n - 4n + 


 Jahn, and extended his research work to the Basel problem
 baad main unka ye kaary phalnic sameekaran ke rup main parinat hua jise ab dirikhle ita falan or riman jita falan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Class positions are not leading to 0; Therefore, 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 seems to be diverging from the term test method
 baad main sandarbh ke taur par yah bhi aavashyak ho gaya ki shrenee ke apsaran kaa moolbhoot str kya he? paribhaasha ke anusaar kisi anant shrenee ke apsaran yaa abhisaran ko us anukram ke aanshik yoga ke apsaran yaa abhisaran dwaara gyaat kiya jaataa he The peculiarity of this sequence is that each integer occurs exactly once — including zero
 yadi khaali aanshik sankalan kiya jaae— jisase purnankon ke samucchy z { \ displaystyle \ mathbb {Z} } kii gananeeyata kii sthapana kii jaati he
 The partial sum makes it clear that the range does not converge on a specific number
 atah 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 apsaari he
 Since the terms 1, −2, 3, −4, 5, −6, 


 correspond to a simple method, so the series 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 relocates the terms and compiles them to obtain a numerical value
 can go
 yadi kisi saadhaaran sankhya s ke liye s = 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 likhnaa sambhav ho to shrenee kaa yoga s = 1⁄4siddh kiya ja saktaa he: Hence the geometric representation of s = 1 4 { \ displaystyle s = { \ frac {1} {4}}} is shown in the right-hand figure
 yadhyapi 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 saamaanya arthon main sankalneey nahin he, atah sameekaran s = 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 = 1⁄4 ko kathan 'yadi is tarah kaa yoga paribhaashit kiya jaataa he' ke saath samarthit kiya ja saktaa he
 The broad definition of "sum" of a divergent category is called the compilation method or compileability method, which sums up some subsets of all possible categories
 saadhaaran sankalnon ko pradarshit karne vaali vibhinn vidhiyaan hai
 From the above discussion, it is proved that with a given computation method that sum stability and linearity and range 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


, then its resulting value will be 1⁄4
 iske atirikt, chunki Grandi series 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 


 = 1⁄2 can also be used with such methods
 san 1891 main arnesto sisera ne yah likhte huye- "2 = 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 likhaa ja saktaa he or iskaa maan 1⁄4 ke baraabar hota he" aashaa vyakt kii ki apsaari shreniyon ko bhi kalan ke upyukt mana ja saktaa he
 For Sisaira, this equation was an application of his pre-published paper theorem that can be recognized as the first known theorem of the history of compilation of divergent categories
 unki sankalan vidhi kaa varnan neeche kiya gaya he; jisaki mukhya avadharana yah he ki shrenee 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


, shrenee 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 


 kaa shrenee 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 


 ke saath kaushi gunanfal he
 The Koshi product of two infinite categories is defined even when both categories are divergent
 is avasthaa main, jahaan Σan = Σbn = Σn ho, kosi gunanfal ke vyanjak nishchit vikarn yoga dwaara diye jate hai: In this case the product range would be as follows: atah do shreniyon kaa kosi gunanfal or yoga 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 


 = 1⁄2, kaa anusaran karne vaali sankalan vidhi yoga 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 = 1⁄4 degi
