 The derivative of this laudatory work of Ramchandra Varma, the editor of Hindi Koshkala, is also mainly word city

 Most of the material in other dictionaries of Hindi is also derived from this dictionary

 The Petevali system has been introduced in the Briha Hindi Dictionary of Gyanmandal
 parantu vah paddati sanskrit ke koshon main jinka nirmaan pashchimi vidwaanon ke prayaas se aarambh hua tha, saikado varsh purv se prachlit ho gai thi
 But even today, the dictionaries of new or modern Indian languages have not reached the level as far as the Oxford English Dictionary or the excellent and highly developed dictionaries of Russian, American, German, Italian, French etc
 languages have reached
 koshrachana kii upar varnit vidha ko ham saadharantah saamaanya bhashaa shabdkosh kah sakate hai
 Thus dictionaries are also monolithic, bilingual, trilingual, and multilingual
 bahubhashi shabdkoshon main tulanaatmak shabdkosh bhi europea bhashaaon main aitihaasik or tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan kii prauji uplabdhiyon se pramanikrut rup main nirmit ho chuke hai
 These include planning the available material mainly as a result of linguistic research and research
 aise tulanaatmak kosh bhi aaj ban chuke hai jinamein pracheen bhashaaon kii tulana milti he
 There are also published dictionaries in which comparative words of multiple languages of more than one Mul family have been maintained
 shabdkoshon ke or bhi naanaa rup aaj viksit ho chuke hai or ho rahe hai
 Dictionaries are also being made in all the rich languages today according to the collective of scientific and classical subjects and that subject
 shastron or vigyaanshakhaon ke paribhaashik shabdkosh bhi nirmit ho chuke hai or ho rahe hai
 These dictionaries are also composed in one language and in two or more languages
 kuch main keval paryaay shabd rahete hai or kuch main vyakhyaayein athwa paribhaashaayen bhi di jaati he
 In the various definitions related to science and technical or technical disciplines, with the help of explanatory definitions and sometimes other means, the correct meaning is also realized
 darshan, bhashavigyaan, manovigyaan, samaajavigyaan or samajashaastra, raajnneetishastra, arthshaastra aadi samast aadhunik vidyaon ke kosh vishwa kii vividh sampann bhashaaon main visheshgyon kii sahaayta se banaae ja rahe hai or is prakruti ke saikadon-hajaaron kosh bhi ban chuke hai
 In addition to the semantic nature, it also contains detailed or short explanations of the lexical elements
 pracheen shastron or darshanon aadi ke vishisht evam paribhaashik shabdon ke kosh bhi bane hai or banaae ja rahe hai
 Apart from this, vocabulary of each book and vocabulary of each writer's literature are also being compiled in Europe, America and India etc

 The alphabetic alphabetical indexes of those glossaries — meaning not given but references — are not necessarily mentioned here

 Such an index of words used by Shakespeare is the most famous

 a grammatical index of grammar mahabhashya is also published
 parantu inamen arth na hone ke kaaran yahan unka vivechan nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Gyan Kosh, another genre of the dictionary has also developed
 iske vrihattam or utksht rup ko incyclopedia kaha gaya he
 The word encyclopedia has been used and accepted for this in Hindi
 yah shabd bengaal vishvakoshkar ne kadachit sarvapratham bengaal ke gyaanakosh ke liye prayukt kiya
 a Hindi version of it was published anew as the Hindi Encyclopedia
 hindi main yah shabd prayukt hone laga he
 Although the first Kishoropayog Gyan Kosh of Hindi was given Vishwabharati by Sri Srinarayan Chaturvedi and Pt
 Krishna Vallabh Dwivedi, the nouns like Gyan Kosh, Gyanadipika, Vishwadarshan, University Bhabhandar etc
 have also been used for knowledge
 swayan sarkaar bhi balashikshopayogi gyanakoshatmak granth kaa prakaashan 'gyansarovar' naam se kar rahi he
 But the word vivkosh became popular in the translation form of the Encyclopaedia
 udiya ke ek vishwakosh kaa naam shabdarthanuwaad ke anusaar gyaan mandal rakhaa bhi gaya
 It seems that the Encyclopaedia or Encyclopaedia of the texts giving knowledge through the broad terms of the broad environment and specific words was determined and relatively different names were given different names to the smaller ones
 angreji aadi bhashaaon main book of nalege, dictionari aav general nalege aadi sheershakon ke antaregat naanaa prakaar ke chote bade vishwakosh athwa gyaanakosh bane hai or aaj bhi nirantar prakashit evam viksit hote ja rahe hai
 Not only this, the number of encyclopedias related to the subject like Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics is also very large
 angreji bhashaa ke madhyam se nirmit anek saamaanya vishwakosh or vishash vishwakosh bhi aaj uplabdh hai
 Encyclopaedia Britannica, Encyclopaedia Americana, is such an encyclopedia of English
 angreji ke saamaanya vishvakoshon dwaara inaki pramanikta or sanmanyata sarvasweekrut he
 Continuously modified, enhanced and refined versions of them are released
 incychlopedia britanika ke do parishisht granth bhi hai jo prakashit hote rahete hai or jo nutan sanskaran kii saamagree ke rup main satatya bhav se sankalit hote rahete hai
 In England, the Encyclopaedia had already begun to become various forms of encyclopedic thesaurus
 gyanakoshon ke bhi itane adhik prakaar or paddatiyaan hai jinaki charchaa kaa yahan avasar nahin he
 Many genres of diverse nominal knowledge types of Charitkosh, Kathakosh historiography, Historical Kalkosh, Jeevanishkriti Koshikosh, mythical-khyatpurushkosh etc
 have been developed and practiced
 yahan prasangatah gyanakoshon kaa sankettmak namanirdesh maatr kar diya ja rahaa he
 We end this topic here and return to the discussion of the Prakrit topic related to the dictionary
 bharat main koshavidya ke aadhunik swarup kaa udbhav or vikaas madhyakaalin hindi koshon kii manyata or rachanaprakriya se bhinn uddeshyon ko lekar hua
 The penetration of the new and changed dimensions of western shells, beliefs, aims, design process and boundary began in the lexicon of India
 sanskrit or itar bhartiya bhashaaon main paashchaatya tathaa bhartiya vidwaanon ke prayaas se chote-bade bahut se kosh nirmit hue
 These shells were also produced in India and outside India
 aarambh main bhartiya bhashaaon ke, mukhyatah sanskrit ke kosh angreji, german, french aadi bhashaaon ke madhyam se banaae gaye
 In these, words of Sanskrit etc
 were also kept in Roman script
 shabdaarth kii vyakhya or arth aadi ke nirdesh kosh kii bhashaa ke anusaar german, angreji, farsi, portugali aadi bhashaaon main die gaye
 Many such works of Bengali, Tamil, etc
 languages were composed by Christian evangelists in India and nearby small islands
 hindi ke bhi aise anek kosh bane
 The first dictionary was probably Ferguman's 'hindustani English' dictionary which was published in London in 1773 AD
 in aarambhik koshon ko 'hindustani kosh' kaha gaya
 These dictionaries were mainly from Hindi
 paashchaatya vidwaanon ke in koshon main hindi ko hindustani kehane kaa kadachit yah kaaran he ki hindustan bharat kaa naam mana gaya or vahaan kii bhashaa hindustani kahi gai
 In the view of these western pundits of phonology, the synonym of Hindi was Hindustani and in general it was the national language of India
 aarambhik kram main koshanirmaan kii preranaatmak chetana kaa bahut kuch saamaanya rup bharat or pashchim main miltaa julata tha
 The Vedic Nighantu of India was a brief collection of meanings and meanings of rare and clichéd words
 yorape main bhi glaceria se jis koshavidya kaa aarambhik bijwapan hua tha, uske mul main bhai viral or clisht shabdon kaa paryaay dwaara arthbodh karana hi uddeshy tha
 From the above semantics of Latin, Shanai: Shani: The Vaikasik stair of modern theology of the West emerged
 bharat or pashchim donon hi sthanon main shabdon ke sakalan main vargapaddati kaa koi na koi rup mil jaataa he
 But later on, the first and foremost distinguishing feature of the new and old dictionaries of the new dictionary was the first - the method of 'alphabetical order'
 yorape main aadhunik koshon kaa jo swaroop viksit hua, uski ruparekha kaa sanket upar kiya ja chukaa he
 In the coast of Europe, Asia and Africa, which came under the influence of Arab countries, shells were being made on the emulation of the said method
 bharat main vyapak paimaane par jis rup main kosh nirmat hote chale, unki sankshipt charchaa kii ja chuki he
 On the basis of all these, it can be said that while assessing the characteristics of modern dictionaries of the best class: koshanirmaan kaa shabdasankalan sarvapramukh aadhaar he
 But the task of collecting words is very difficult
 mukhya rup main shabdon kaa chayan do stroton se hota he - Handwritten and printed texts are taken for written words from written literature
 parantu iske antargat pracheen hastlekhon or mudrit gratho ke aadhaar par jab shabdasankalan hota he tab ubhayvidh aadhargranthon kii pramanikta or pathshuddhi aavashyak hoti he
 The importance of his inscribed words decreases and their chances of confusion increase
 aajkal aise computer program uplabdh hai jo shabdkosh ke saare kaam karte hai
 They are not printed on paper but in a specific file-format and through a 'dictionary software' help the user to find the semantics
 inamen kuch aisi suvidhaayen bhi uplabdh hai jo paramparaagat shabdkoshon main sambhav hi nahin he; jaise shabd kaa uccharan dhwani ke madhyam se dena aadi

 In the first issue of the magazine, charlotte-eduva Giannere chose a nickname for herself, a renamed form of her maternal grandfather "lacourbacie" - "le Corbusier", based on her belief that anyone would Can be restructured

 In 1922, Le Corbusier and Giannere opened a studio at 35 Rue de Savre

 One of them was the Meissen "citrohan", which was based on the French carmaker Citroen, as Le Corbusier defended modern industrial methods and materials to build this house

 For many years, French officials struggled unsuccessfully in the slums of Paris

 He believed that his new architectural improvements would provide a new organizational solution that would improve the standard of living of the lower classes
 unka imubyel vila ek aisi hi pariyojna thi jisamen koshika jaise ghar ek ke upar ek bane hue the, inamen ek mukhya cameraa, shayan kaksh va rasoi tathaa bagichaa tha
 Not satisfied with building just a few houses, Le Corbusier began studying the entire city
 1922 main unhone 30 lakh logon kii "aadhunik nagari" kii yojana prastut kii
 At the center of this plan was the sixty-storey skyscrapers, which were steel-framed office buildings and had glass walls

 Just in the middle was a traffic center, with bus, train, and street intersections at different levels and at the top an airport
 unki yah manyata thi ki vyavsaayik hawaijahaz gagan chumbiyon ke bich utar paayenge
 Le Corbusier separated the roads from the walkways and gave cars more recognition for traffic
 kendriya gagan chumbiyon se dur jate jate chote, kam oonchaai vaale ghar shuru hote the jo ki sadak se thodi dur hariyaali main bane the, jahaan naagarik rahete the
 Le Corbusier hoped that French industrialists with political ambitions would move in this direction and give society a facelift by copying Taylorist and Fordist policies from American industries
 norma evenson na kaha he, "prastaavit shahar kuch logon ke liye ek mahatvakankshi duuradrushti thi or kuch auron ke liye prachlit naagarik vatavaran kaa ek vishaal asveekaran

 Perhaps the biggest difference between the modern city and Ojaswi Nagar was that the new idea does not have a class-based division, the houses are decided on the basis of family size, not on the basis of economic status

 Le Corbusier's Villa Savoy summarizes his five architectural points
 in binduon ke bare main unhone apni patrika lespri novyuu or pustak vars oon architekchar main likhaa he, inkaa vikaas ve 1920 ke dashak main kar rahe the
 First, Le Corbusier built most of the structure over the ground, using pillows for support - a slab of concrete
 ye piloti ghar kaa dhaanchaa sambhalate or inaki badaulat agali do binduon ko samarthan miltaa - ek mukt diwaal, yani aisi deevaaren jinhen vazan uthaani kii zarurat na ti or vaastushilpi unhen jaise chaahe bana saktaa tha or ek khulaa farsh, yani har farsh ko jaise chaahe kamaron main baanta ja saktaa tha, deevaaron kii chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin thi
 The second floor of the Villa Savoy features long strips of windows that allow all four spaces to be seen uninterrupted
 yah khaali sthaan unki pranali kii chauthi bindu tha
 The fifth point is the garden on the roof - greenery on the roof in lieu of the greenery that the building destroyed
 nichle str se teesri manzil kii chat tak jaataa ek ramp dhaanche ko ek vaastushilpi prominede pradaan karata he
 The white tubed railing is reminiscent of the "sea ship" industrial beauty that Le Corbusier loved

 Le Corbusier used the golden ratio in his modular system to measure architectural proportions
 is pranali ko unhone vitruvius, leonardo da vinci ke "vitruvian purush", leone batista albarti or anyon ke kaam ko aage badhaane kii tarah hi mana, jo ki vaastushilp ke pradarshan or kaam ko sudhaarney main maanav sharir ke anupaaton kaa prayog karte aa rahe the
 In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier also improved the system through human measurements, Fibonacci numbers, and dual units
 ve leonardo ke maanviya anupato main sunahare anupaat ke suzav ko duusari had tak le gaye
 He divided the length of the human body into two portions on the navel, based on the golden ratio, then divided these portions on the feet and throat again into the golden ratio; They used these golden ratios in the modular system
 lee corbuziye kii 1927 kii garche main vila stein, modulor pranali kaa udhaaharan bani

 Although the politics of Lagardale and Veloi were part of fascism, anti-semitism, and post-modernism, it is difficult to say how much of Le Corbusier's involvement with all these movements

 His later work at the site of construction reveals a good understanding of the complex impact of modernism, but his civil works have also been criticized by many
 takneekee itihasvid va vaastushills maseekshak louis mamford ne beete kal kaa aane vaale kal kaa shahar main kehete hai, James Howard Kunstler, a member of the neo-urbanism movement, described Lee Carbuzier's city planning plan as destructive and expensive: lee corbuziye praarambhik ucch aadhuniktaa ke agrani vaastushilpi netaa the, jinaki 1925 kii plan vaoicine thi daayen tat par paris ke puure marai jile ko tahas nahas kar ke chaudee sadakon ke bich samaan dikhne vaali gaganchumbiyaan bana dena
 It was the fate of Paris that whenever he took the plan over the next forty years, the city officials laughed at him - and Le Corbusier was self-effacing

 For many years, many architects worked with him in Le Corbusier's studio and many of them became well-known themselves, such as the painter-architect Nadir Afonso who imbibed Le Corbusier's ideas into his beauty theory

 The destruction of traditional urban spaces became more accepted through the ideas of Le Corbusier, as this new city was built with low density, low-cost suburban and wide roads in rural areas, which led to the construction of a middle-class family house

 As jobs progressed to the suburban ends coming to the end of these roads, urban villagers found their communities cut off from these major roads; Nor did they have public transport facilities so that they could economically do jobs in suburban centers

 The question mark has arisen over the views of Le Corbusier due to increasing traffic expenses and interest in middle and upper class people towards suburban and rural lifestyle
