haalaanki, 1950 ke dashak se hi, british samprabhu ke raaj ke adheen aanevaale rajyon ko rashtramandal ke anya sadsy deshon se vibhakt rup se bodh karne hetu "realm" shabd kaa upyog adhikaarak dastavezon main kiya jaataa rahaa he, yahan tak kii rani elizabeth ke rajasidhaaran kii ghoshnaa main bhi is shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 These states are called realms because, despite being under the same ruler, all these states are completely universal, and completely independent from each other, so it is not part of 16 countries, one political unit, but 16 There are different states
 kyonki, reyalm ek kanoonee shabd nahin he, isiilie iskaa koi aadhikarik anuwaad bhi upasthit nahin he
 Therefore, to understand these states, any word that makes sense of the land under a king can be used
 saadhaaran taurapar, prajabhumi, pradesh, or paribhumi jaise shabdon kaa prayog hota he, inke alaava, pramandal or rajbhumi shabdon kaabhi upyog ho saktaa he
 According to the present situation, since the year 1992, there are a total of 16 Commonwealth tribes in the world, with a total area of 1,87,00,000 square kilometers, and a population of 14,30,00,000
 jisame se 6 sabase adhik aabaad desh hai:united kingdom, canda, australia, newzealand or jamaica
 The system of Rajmukut or The Crown is a special political concept, which has a very important role in the legal and political system of Britain and other Commonwealth territories
 is soch kaa vikaas england rajya main samantvaadi kaal ke dauraan shabdic mukut tathaa rashtriya sampadaaon ko samprabhu tathaa unke / unki vyaktigat sampatti se vibhakt kar sambodhit karne hetu hua tha
 According to this view, the Rajmukut is seen as a symbol of state and governance in all aspects of administration and in every dimension, and the British sovereign is seen as a continuous incarnation of the Rajmukut
 atah britain tathaa rashtramandal pradeshon me is shabdaawalee ko shashan athwa sarkaar ke liye ek upalakshan ke rup main bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, yaa sidhe-sidhe aisa bhi kaha ja saktaa he kii yah rajtantr ko hi sambodhit karne kaa ek doosraa tarika he
 Legally, "rajmukut" can be defined as an individual institution which is the entire judicial embodiment of the legislature, executive and judiciary
 atah is sandarbh main is shabd ko kisi shahi poshaak ke vaastavik mukut ke saath sambhramit nahin karnaa chahie
 As an institution, the Rajmukut is the oldest functioning institution in Britain's political system
 prayek rashtramandal pradesh main rajmukut kii sankalpana saamaan, parantu vibhakt vidhik sankalpanaayen hai
 Therefore, in Commonwealth law, judicial documents to distinguish one jurisdiction from another, "crown the right 


" Example: "the Crown in right of the United Kingdom 


" or "la Couronne du chef du Qu√©bec "also the Crown in right of Canada, The Crown in right of Australia, The Crown in right of Papua New Guinea, etc
, and because, Canada and Australia are federal nations, so each Canadian province and Australian state" Rajmukut "
 mukut ke adhikaron ko yaa adhirat dwaara swayan yaa phir unke pratinidhi dwaara, sambandhit mantriyon yaa adhikariyon kii salaah par prayog kiya jaataa he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions, including the Bill of Rights, 1689, the Act of Settlement, 1701 and the Act of Union, 1707
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession
 singhasana par virajman hone ke pashchaat ek vyakti apane nidhan tak raaj karata he
 The only voluntary resignation in history was by Edward VIII in 1936, which was legalized by a special Act of Parliament
 antim baar jab kisi shaasha ko anaichhik rup se nishkashit kiya gaya tha, wo tha 1688 main james saptam or dwitiya jinhen glorious revolution ke samay nishkashit kiya gaya tha
 The Act of Settlement, 1701, limits the succession to the legally Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James I
 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 According to the Acts of Settlement of 1701, only the "legitimate" Protostant descendants of Sophia, the granddaughter of James I, the granddaughter of Hanover, were able to inherit the throne
 arthath, shahi parivaar ke vansh ke keval jaays santan hi singhasana par uttaradhikaar kaa haq rakhte hai, or koi bhi avaidh santan, tathaa unke vanshaj, singhasana par kisi bhi prakaar kaa adhikaar nahin rakhte hai
 In this context, according to the provisions of the Royal Marriage Act, 1772, any member of the royal family is required to obtain the sovereign's approval to marry, and any marriage done without the sovereign's approval shall be deemed "illegal", and The person and his children will be deprived of authority over the throne
 is adhinium ke praavdhaanon main 2013 ke saxeshan tu da crown act dwaara kuch parivartan laaye gaye
 According to the Act, the first six members of the succession order are required to obtain sovereign permission to marry, otherwise the person and all the progeny and descendants of that marriage will be deemed to be deprived of the succession order
 parantu aisi kisi bhi vivaah ko kisi bhi prakaar se gaiyr-kanoonee nahin qaraar ja saktaa he
 The group of the closest members of the sovereign's family is called the royal family
 haalaanki, aisa koi drudh niyam yaa vidhaan nahin he, jo yah suniyojit karata ho kii kin vyaktiyon ko is vishesh samooh main rakhaa jaae, naahi koi aisa vidhaan he jo rajpariwaar ko vistrut rup se paribhaashit karata ho
 Nonetheless, those individuals to whom His / Her Majesty or His / Her Royal Highness are generally referred to are members of the royal family
 is maapdand ke aadhaar par raaj parivaar main, adhirat, unke / unki sahachaari, purv samprabhu kii vidhwaa / vidhurgan, wales ke rajkumaar ke jyeshthatam putr ke santan, tathaa purv shaasha ke putron kii dharmapatniyaan yaa unki vidhwaayen or unke purush-rekha ke pautra shaamil honge
 In the context of different Commonwealth territories, different terminology can also be used for this particular group, for example, in Australia this group is called the Australian Royal Family and in Canada the Canadian Royal Family

 Although in these nations also they have almost the same rank and authority as in Britain, but in those countries, they have no real political or traditional duties, almost all the duties of the ruler as their representative fulfills the General Manager of that country
 
 britain kii sarkaar kaa rashtramandal pradeshon kii sarkaron ke kaary main koi bhi bhoomika yaa hastkshep nahin he

 purvatah rashtron ke rashtramandal ke saare desh rashtramandal paribhumi ke hissaa hua karte the, parantu 1950 main bharat ne swatantraaa ke pashchaat swayan ko ganraajya ghoshit kiya, or british rajasatta kii rashtrapramukh ke rup main samprabhutaa ko bhi khatm kar diya
 But India retained the membership of the Commonwealth
 uske baad se, rashtramandal deshon main, british samprabhu ko "rashtramandal ke pramukh" kaa pad bhi diya jaataa he, jo rashtramandal ke sanghathan kaa nammaatr pramukh kaa pad he

 Words such as: bahishkrut atmaaon ko ek or duniya main rahane ke rup main kalpana kii jaati he phir bhi, jaruri nahin ki devataaon ko aadhyatmik rup se aadhyatmik rup se janaa jaataa he, rakshason ko bhi bhautik rup main mana ja saktaa he; udhaaharan ke pishaachon ko kabhi-kabhi maanav mastishk ke rup main varnit antaraal ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he, jo raat kii ghadiyon ke dauraan rahane vaale logon par hamalaa karne ke liye kabr se jari hota he
 The so-called Spectre Huntsman of the Malay Peninsula is said to be a man who knocks the sky with his dog, which he cannot find on Earth, with the mother's mother constantly searching for a male-deer conceived Huh; But he is a living person; There is no statement that he ever died, nor is he a soul

 Belief in demons goes back many centuries
 Parsi belief teaches that there are 3,333 enemies, some with specific dark responsibilities such as war, starvation, disease, etc
 babul puranic kathaon main, saat bure devataaon ko shedu, yaa "tufaan-daanav" ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 They were represented as winged bulls, descended from giant bulls used as a defensive species of royal palaces, with the name "shed" also connoting a genius genius in Babylonian magic literature
 yah chalde se tha ki naam "shedu" israeliyon ke paas aayaa tha, or isliye tanaach ke lekhakon ne kuch kanani devi devataaon ke liye shashim shabd ko lagu kiya
 He had also said of the "destroyer" who would "kill the Egyptians" as God

 Traditionally, Buddhism affirms the existence of demons who torment sinners and suffer sins, or those who try to thwart their knowledge, as well as a demon called Mara, " The Prince of Darkness "or" Evil One "says sources in Sanskrit
 maar ke anuyaayi ko maaraa, shaitan bhi kaha jaataa he, or inhen aksar rog yaa maansik avarodhon ke pratinidhitiv ke kaaran ke rup main uddhrut kiya jaataa he
 Mara completely assimilated into the Chinese worldview, and was called Moe
 mishael stricman ke mutabik, jab pehali sadi ke edi main china pahunche to "rakshasi prabhaavon ke mahaan karkashwad" ke bich buddha dharm kii asann giravat or patan kaa vichaar pehle se hi buddha dharm kaa ek mahatvapurn ghatak tha
 Demonic forces gained enormous power in the world
 Some writers of the time were assigned to serve the higher purpose of implementing an "initial cleansing" that would purify and purify humanity in preparation for a final, messianic renewal 
 madhyakaalin chini buddha dharmavigyaan bhartiya buddha dharm se kaaphi prabhavit tha
 Indian academic science is also fully and systematically described in written sources, although during the millennium's direct influence in China of Buddhism, "chinese politicalism was killed as honorable," Taoist rituals with many Indian demons Permanent numbers also emerge in texts
 iske alaava, ek pramukh mahayan buddha dharm kaa paath, pachaas rakshasi rajyon kaa varnan karata he: tathakthith pachaas skanda mars, jo "nakaaratmak" darpan kii tarah pratibimb yaa sahi samadhi rajyon se vichlan hai
 In this context the demons are believed by Buddhists to be humans possessing some supernatural powers, who in the past could have practiced religion, may have been Buddha's teachings, but because of this practice it would have been misconceived, true Jnana and Karua failed to develop compassion, which are the inseparable qualities of an enlightened race such as the Buddha or the Bodhisattva in their self-realization, a type of 20th century An encounter with such creatures is described in the Rummukh Tibetan Buddhist guru Tulku Urgen Rinpoche, The Bling Splendor
 isliye, sandarbh ke aadhaar par, buddha dharm ke rakshason main donon pareshaan dimag rajyon or vaastavik praaniyon kaa ullekh kar sakate hai
 Christian Denisology is the study of demons from a Christian point of view
 It is primarily based on the Bible, the opening of these texts, the writings of early Christian philosophers and legends associated with salutation, traditions and other beliefs
 isai itihaas ke dauraan kai lekhakon ne vibhinn uddeshyon ke liye rakshason ke bare main likhaa he
 Theologians such as Thomas Aquinas wrote about behaviors that Christians should be aware of, witch hunters like Heinrich Kramer wrote about how to find out about people and what they had to do with demons
 
 solomon ke lesar kii tarah kuch granth yaa pope honorius ke gremoir nirdeshon ke saath likhe jate hai ki kaise bhagwaan ke naam par rakshason ko bulaane ke liye or praayah un logon dwaara likhe gaye hai jinhen carch
 These latter texts were generally more elaborate, describing names, ranks, and demons personally and clearly
 zyaadaatar isai aam taur par in granthon ko shaitan yaa farji donon ke rup main asweekaar karte hai
 In modern times, few academic texts have been written by Christians, usually in a similar vein to Thomas Aquinas, explaining their effects in the world and how faith can diminish or eliminate harm from them
 kuch isai lekhakon, jaise jaik chik or jon tod, craimar ke samaan iraadon ke saath likhte hai, jisase duniya main rakshason or unke maanav agent sakriy hai
 These claims may deviate from mainstream ideology, and may include beliefs such as Christian rock being an instrument through which demons exert influence over people
 sabhi isai nahin maanate hai ki rakshason ko shabdic arthon main maujuud he
 It seems that the language of exorcism in the New Testament is an example, which was once employed in modern days to describe the treatment of diseases classified as epilepsy, mental illness etc
 vaidic shastron main atmaaon kii ek shrinkhalaa shaamil he jise rakshason ke rup main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 These souls are the souls of beings who have committed certain specific sins
 As a purification, they are condemned to roam without physical form for a time, until rebirth
 apurna ichchhaaon yaa krodh ke saath marane vaale praaniyon ko bhi "ghutane" kaha jaataa he jab tak ki is tarah ke muddon kaa samaadhaan nahin ho jaataa
 The Hindu text Atharvaveda gives an account of the nature and residence of such souls, including how to celebrate and control them
 Hinduism has enchanted traditions that seek to control such souls to do their bidding
 hindu paath garud puraana anya prakaar kii dand or nark main die gaye faisle kaa vivaran detaa he; isane yah bhi bataaya ki kaise aatma na to duniya kii yatra karti he
 Secularism, as a subject studying evil and favorite creatures, will treat its Islamic equivalent Shetten, but instead focus on the jinn, though their attitude towards humans may vary and be good and bad
 Can
 tadnusaar, islam main dharamshastra bura atmaaon par dhyaan kendrit nahin karata he jo achche atmaaon ke ek swabhaav ke vipareet he, balki shaitan, jinn, swargdooton or islamic dharamshastra main koi matlab nahin ke saath islamic lokkathaon main upasthit kai alokik praaniyon sahit, adrishy praaniyon ke sabhi prakaar se sambandhit hai
 Islam integrated the concept of jinn from pre-islamic animism, but reduced the status of the former divine jinn to humans and created things that share the earth with humans and will judge justice
 tadnusaar, jinn kii samaaj manushyon kii tarah he, or dharm ko paidaa karne, khaane, so, marane or abhyaas karne ke liye mana jaataa he
 Due to their similarity with humans, there are many stories that humans and jinn can have sexual relations, and some legal books also deal with the conditions of a marriage between these different creatures
 phir bhi, islam ne jinn ke saath baatcheet ko manaa kiya
 Genes can also lead to the capture and harm of humans, but the attacks of the jinn are considered as the result of their own intentions rather than evil nature, although a person jinny is probably evil, but then due to his own judgment Genes either live in an intermediary region, between the celestial world and the physical plane, like the Greek daemon and ancient Rome genes, or are roaming the earth, invisible to human eyes

 islam main shaitanoon kii avadharana rakshason kii isai avadharanaon kii samanta he or sambhavat: islam dwaara arabi gyaan ke liye swargdooton ke saath pesh kii gai thi
 They become slaves to the Devil, who, like Christian thought, was banished from heaven
 agar iblis khud mul rup se ek angil yaa ek jini islamic vishwaas main vivaadaaspad he, phir bhi uske patan ke baad, vah ek shaitan main badal gaya or phir shaayten kaa janm hua
 Shatten is not to die until the last day and cannot be believed, so they are always evil, whispering heartily, looking for the chiefs who stray from God
 iske alaava, shaitan or jinn shabd overlap ho sakate hai, kyonki ek buree jini ko shaitan bhi kaha jaataa he, jaise bure insaanon ko bhi shaitan kaha ja saktaa he agar unhen vishuddh rup se bura mana jaataa he
 In Islam, angels are in heaven, carrying out specific tasks received by God
 unke paas prakruti kii duniya kii koi ichha nahin he, isliye ve nahin khate hai, pite hai yaa paidaa nahin karte hai, lekin prithvi par hone vaale unke daure ke dauraan ve manushya ke aakaar par le sakate hai
 The most elected angels live in forcibly, the lower angels live in the area below, where they can be faced by humans in dreams and dreams, others can also control hell
 ishwar or swargeey praaniyon ke bich ek sambandh, jaisaa ki purv-islamic arab main kiya gaya he, inkaar kar diya he
 In Islam, God is not equal to any spiritual, inauspicious or physical institution
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki yahudee yahudee vidroh kii utpatti kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ve do vishisht or aksar pratispardhi mithkon-buraai-admic or anoikik ke liye khoji ja sakati hai, jinamein se ek eden garden main adam or eve ke kaaran hone vaale aadmi ke patan se judaa tha
 The Fall of the Angels in the Endedulvian Period Thus, the primitive story traces the source of evil to Satan's crime and the fall of man, a trend depicted in the books of Adam and Eve to the newly created Adam due to the fearlessness of Satan Refusing to obey God's command to dedicate
 iske vipareet, jaldi anochi parampara ne azzel ke netritv main girte hue logon kii kahani par rakshason kii utpatti kii apni samaj kaa aadhaar kiya
 Scholars believe that these two enigmatic figures ‚Äî Azazel and Satan ‚Äî exercised early influence on early Jewish theology
 unki vaicharik yatraaon kii shuruyaat main jabaki aazazel or shaitan bhrashtachar ke vishisht etiologies se jude do vishisht or aksar pratidwandvi pravritiyon ke pratinidhiyon ke rup main pahachaane jate hai, baad main yahudee or isai shaikshanik gyaan main donon shatruon ko ek duusare kii praasangik kahaniyaan nai sankalpanaatmak main pravesh karne main sakasham hai kshamta
 In these later traditions, Satanel is often depicted as the leader of the fallen angels while his ideological rival Azazel is depicted as the seducer of Adam and Eve
 jabaki aitihaasik yahudee dharm kabhi bhi "aadhikarik taur par" rakshason ke bare main ek kathor siddhanton ko manyata nahin detaa, kai vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki escatology, daniliji, or demonalogy ke baad ke excilil avadharanaon ko parsivaad dwaara prabhavit kiya gaya tha
 However, some believe that these concepts were derived as part of the Kabbalist tradition
 haalanki kai log aaj maanate hai ki lucifer or shaitan usee ke liye alag-alag naam hai, na ki sabhi vidwaan is drushtikon kii sadsyta lete hai
 The use of the name "lucifer" for the devil stems from a particular interpretation of Isaiah 14: 3-20, which does not refer to a fallen messenger but to the defeat of a particular Babylonian king whom he would give a title Is indicates that in English is called Day Star or Morning Star
 2 pataras 1:19 or anya jagahon par, latin shabd lucifer kaa upyog morning star ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he, jisamen shaitan kaa koi sambandh nahin hota he
 It is only in post-new Testament times that the Latin word lucifer was used as the name of the devil, both in religious writings and in the novel, especially when referring to him before his fall from heaven
 vahaan ek se adhik udhaaharan hai jahaan rakshason ke aane ke liye kaha jaataa he, jaisaa ki paharedaaron or grigori swargdooton ke paapon, lilyth ke adam ko chhodkar, pishaachon ke rup main rakshason kii tarah, yahudee lokkathaon main ashuddh atmaaon jaise ki diababook, or dusht insaanon ke rup main bhi rakshas ban gaye hai Satanism is a name for a diverse group of religions that regard demons in general and Satan in particular as positive entities, either as actual entities, or using Satan and other demons

 These verbs depend only on the solution of some equations, in which very broad questions are easily solved; For example, if the line intersects a curve = o, the solution of both these equations will determine the location of their intersection points
 yadi in samikarnon ke mul vaastavik hai, to rekha vakr ko katati he
 If equal, the line touches the curve

 'engineering' and 'engineer' originated from the French words Ing√©nierie and ingenieur
 ye shabd puraani french ke 'engigneor' se vyutpann hai jiskaa arth 'yuddh-mashin kaa nirmaataa'
 Although the words 'engineering' and 'engineer' in English are similar to French words in pronunciation, they originated from a completely different source
 itnaa hi nahin, inaki vyutpatti 'ingine' shabd se nahin hui he 
 The English word synonym for 'engineering' is "engineering", which derives from the Latin word "ingenium"; It means 'natural mastery'
 nikat bhootkaal main abhiyantriki shabd kaa jo arth kosh main miltaa tha vah sankshep main is prakaar bataaya ja saktaa he ki But this limited definition could no longer run
 abhiyantriki shabd kaa arth ab ek ore nabhikeey abhiyantriki ke ucch vaigyanik or pravidhik kshetra se lekar maanviya gunon se sambandhit vishyon, jaise shramik niyantran prabandheey kaaryakshmata, samay or gati kaa adhyayan ityadi, anek praayogic vigyaanon ke vistrut kshetra ko ghere hue he
 Thus it would be more appropriate to define engineering as "it is the science and art of efficient use of natural means for the physical service of man"
 aitihaasik rup se ejiniyari kaa upyog sabase pehle sena or sainik kaaryon main hua
 After this, when it started being used for civil works, the new branch was named - 'civil Engineering'
 samay ke saath ejiniyari ke anya kshetron kaa vikaas hua jinaki prakruti civil ejiniyari se bhi alag thi or unhen 'yantric ejiniyari', 'vaidyut ejiniyari' aadi naam diya gaya
 Civil engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering are the traditional branches of engineering

 The uninterrupted inspection of both experimental and natural phenomena and the careful use of the fruits of this type of inspection on engineering problems in such a way that the minimum expenditure of time and money gives maximum service to the society is the major method of engineering
 shuddh vaigyanik abhiyantriki kii ulajhanon ko sulajhane kii reeti vaigyanik chaahe khoj paae hon yaa na paae hon, abhiyantaa ko to apana kaary puraa karnaa hi hoga
 In such a situation, the engineer resorts to experimental analysis to some extent and finds a solution that can work in a way that, while properly managing the defense, can make his daily problems solvable
 jais-jaise sambandhit vaigyanik ansh kaa uskaa gyaan achook hota jaataa he, vah raksha ke prabandh main kami karke vyay bhi gata saktaa he
 The intellectual and functional consideration of the problems has also enabled the engineer to enter into those fields which are believed to be concerned with scientist, doctor, economist, manager, humanistic science and art from the beginning

 Engineering is an applied science
 ejiniyari main karypranali kaa mahatv pehle se he kintu ab yah or bhi adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 As a result, 'systems engineering', 'knowledge engineering' etc
 have been born
 mote taur par kisi bhi ejeeniyar ko do baaten samajni hotin hai - Keeping in mind the 'requirements' and restrictions, the engineer prepares specifications, drawings, quality control to manufacture the required goods or services
 praayah ejeeniyar ke paas ek se adhik hal hote hai
 He considers diverse options
 vah vikalpon ko takneekee, aarthik tathaa suraksha kii drushti se moolyankan karata he or jo sarvaadhik upyukt parinaam detaa he use chun liya jaataa he
 Engineer work is very challenging
 galat hal kaa parinaam bahut mahangaa yaa bahut khatarnaak bhi ho saktaa he
 That is why often an engineer tests and analyzes a solution before implementing it
 iske liye vah prototip, laghu-aakaar vaale yaa sarlikrut modelon kaa prayog, simulation, dhvamsi yaa adhwansi test tathaa fatig test aadi kaa sahaara letaa he
 Since the result of a wrong solution can be severe, the engineer uses the safety multiplier when adopting pre-fabricated solutions to minimize the possibility of side effects
 kintu suraksha-gunak jitna hi adhik hoga, hal utana hi mahangaa, bada, yaa kam daksh hoga
 Russia's innovation specialist Gennrich Altshuler concluded after studying a number of patents that small-scale engineering solutions are based on agreements, while in large-scale work the engineer chooses the solution that addresses the greatest difficulty of the problem
