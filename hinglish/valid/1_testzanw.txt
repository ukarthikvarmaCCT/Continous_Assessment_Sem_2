 Such a belief or idea is called illusion, despite the fact that there is no concrete evidence to be wrong, the person does not leave it
 yah us aasthaa se alag he jise vyakti galat soochna, agyaan, kattarpan aadi ke kaaran pakade rahata he
 According to this the definition of the word is - a belief that is a pathological condition
 vikrutivigyaan ke taur par dekha jaae to yah galat yaa apurna jaankaree, siddhant, morrkhtaa, atmachetana, bhram, yaa dharna ke anya prabhaavon se paidaa hone vaale vishwaas se bilkul alag he
 Especially during any neurological or mental illness, a person is prone to confusion
 vaise iskaa sambandh kisi vishesh rog se judaa nahin he, atah anek rogaatmak sthitiyon ke dauraan rogi ko bhram hone lagata he
 Mental disorders, especially dementia, paraphrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia seizures and delusions of mental depression are of particular clinical importance
 haalanki hazaron varshon se, paagalpan ke bare main tarah-tarah kii dharanaen maujuud hai, lekin manovaigyanik or darshanik karl jaspers pratham vyakti the jinhone 1917 main likhi apni pustak 'general saycopatholojee' main kisi vishwaas ko bhram ghoshit karne ke teen pramukh maandand bataaye hai
 These criteria are: ye maandand aaj bhi manorog ke aadhunik nidaan main lagu hote hai
 The definition given in the recently published 'diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' is: vaise is paribhaasha par vivaad he ki 'baaki sabhi logon ke vishwaas se hatakar hota he' kaa taatpary nikalataa hai ki yadi koi vyakti kisi aisi dharna par vishwaas karata he jis par baaki adhikansh log vishwaas nahin karte to vah vyakti bhramaatmak vichaar kii jakad main he
 Further, it is ironic that, while the above three criteria are attributed to Jaspers, he himself states that those criteria are 'vague' and only 'extraterritorial'
 unhone yah bhi likhaa he ki, chunki bhram kaa asli yaa 'aatanrik' 'maandand bhram ke praathmik anubhav or vyaktitv main hone vaale badlaav se janaa ja saktaa he, isliye bhram, bhram hote hue bhi, vishay ko lekar sahi ho saktaa he: jaise - vishwa yuddh ho rahaa he
 ' bhram ko, betuka yaa tark-sangat or manodasha-anuroop yaa manodasha-tatasth, in do virgon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 In addition to these classifications, illusions often correspond to a coherent subject
 haalanki bhram kisi bhi vishay main ho saktaa he, lekin kuch vishay hai jin par bhram hona aam baat he
 Commonly occurring delusions are: aadhunik paribhaasha or jaspers ke mul mandandon kii aalochana kii gai he, chunki har paribhaashit sthiti ke pratikul udhaaharan bhi paae ja sakate hai
 Studies on mentally ill patients show that over time, the intensity of delusions and the persistence of belief change, indicating that it is not necessarily certainty and impossibility to improve, Both are components of misleading assumptions
 yah zaruri nahin he ki bhram ek mithyaa ho yaa 'bahari satyata kaa galat anumaan'
 kuch dharmik or aadhyatmik manyataon ko apni sahajata ke kaaran jhuthlaayaa nahin ja saktaa or isiliye inhen asaty yaa galat bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa, phir chaahe in manyataon par vishwaas karne vaala vyakti bhram kaa shikaar ho yaa na ho
 In other circumstances, confusion can be a true belief
 udhaaharan ke taur par, irshyaa kaa bhram, jisamen bhramit vyakti kaa maananaa hota he ki uskaa jivan saathi uske saath vishwasghaat kar rahaa he yaa rahi he, parinamswaroop, apane bhramit jivan saathi dwaara daale ja rahe nirantar or anuchit tanaav ke kaaran vafaadaar jivan saathi bewafaai karne par utaaru ho saktaa he
 In such a case, when the truth comes out later, confusion and confusion do not remain
 anya maamalon main, bhram kii jaanch karne vaale doctor yaa manochikitsak bhram ko galat bataa sakate hai, kyonki unhen lagata he ki aisi betuki yaa zarurat se zyaada vishwaas kii gai dharna asambhav he
 Psychiatrists have neither the time nor the means to examine the truth of the confused person's fact that the real belief has not been mistakenly given as an illusion
 Such a situation is called the Martha Mitchell Effect, which is associated with the name of a woman who was the wife of a lawyer who alleged that illegal activities were going on in the White House
 us vakt us mahila ke daawey ko maansik aswasthta kaa lakshan mana gaya, lekin waterget ke ghotaale ke baad uskaa daawa sahi sabit hua 
 For some such reasons, the definitions of the real illusions given by Jaspers were so criticized that they were ultimately considered 'utterly incomprehensible'

 For all these reasons psychiatrist Anthony David commented that "there is no acceptable qualified definition of delusion
 " manochikitsak tab kisi vishwaas ko bhram kaa nirupan maanate hai jab vishwaas kii dharna bilkul hi betuki ho or jisase rogi par sankat chaaya ho, yaa rogi zarurat se zyaada chintit rahata ho, khaaskar tab jab vipareet saboot yaa uchit tark pesh karne ke baavjood bhi rogi apane vishwaas par hi ada rahata he
 There are two major reasons for the 'origin of illusions': dopamine kii maatra bad jane se 'mastishk ke kaamkaaj main gadabadi' ke lakshan dikhaai dene lagate hai
 a primary study on psychotic syndrome examined whether an overdose of dopamine was necessary to maintain certain illusions, in fact this study was done to clarify whether dopamine psychosis was found in psychosis

 For example, delusions of criminality and punishment are often found among people in a Christian, Westernized country like Austria, but in Pakistan - where there is a high likelihood of crime, no delusions are found
 This is said to be a decisive influence of cultural components in the representation of illusions
 
 According to several studies, people in Austria also get caught up in the delusions of conviction and punishment, who are patients of Parkinson's disease and are being treated with i-dopa - artificial dopamine

 In mathematics, the Taylor series is a series that represents a function by the sum of infinite terms
 ye pad us falan ke kisi bindu par avaklon ke maan se nikaale jate hai
 It was given in 1775 by the English mathematician Brook Taylor
 kisi vaastavik maan vaale yaa samishra maan vaale falan ƒ, jo anant tak avaklit kiya ja saktaa he, kii kisi bindu a par tailor shrenee nimnlikhit ghaataank shrenee dwaara di jaati he: You can write it in a more compact way jahaan n! kaa arth n kaa phactorial he; ƒ kaa matlab ƒ kaa bindu a par nvaz avkalaj he
 When a = 0, this range is called the mclarins series

 The mclarins range of −1 at x = 0 will be the following geometric series: atah x−1 kii bindu a = 1 par tailor shrenee yah hogi: Integrating the above mentioned Clarins series, we get the Maclarins series for log, where log means natural logarithm

 Even before the department, the department assumes a separate title which is expressed as a department

 On the death of the father, the son who is the owner of the ancestral property deserves as shareholder and not as the heir
 mitakshra putr kaa uttaradhikaar keval pita kii nij kii paidaa kii hui sampatti main maanati he
 The realm assumes the origin of the heirs of the heirs after the annihilation of the predecessor
 uske anusaar jab tak pita jivit he tab tak paitruk sampatti par uskaa pur adhikaar he; vah use jo chaahe so kar saktaa he
 The origin of the sonship is born only when the father dies
 yadhyapi yajyavlky ke is shloke main bhurya pitamahopatt nibandhi dravyamev vaa
 Tatra Syatrisham Swamya Pituh: Putrasya Chobhacho: The equal rights of father and son have been clearly stated, however, Jemutavahana has pulled out from this verse that it is the sense that sons do not originate from their birth, but from the father's death
 mitakshra or daybhag ke anusaar jis kram se uttaradhikari hote hai vah neeche diya jaataa haih and so on and so forth
 upar jo kram diya gaya he use dekhne se pataa lagegaa ki mitakshra mata kaa swatv pehle karti he or daybhag pita kaa
 The verse of Yajnavalkya is: is shloke ke 'pitaru' shabd ko lekar mitakshra kahati he ki 'mata piti' is samaas main mata shabd pehle aata he or mata kaa sambandh bhi adhik ghanishtha he, isse mata kaa swatv pehle he
 Jemutavahana says that the word 'pitrau' is a sign of father's primacy before it is the father's self
 mithila, kaashi or maharashtra praant main mata kaa swatv pehle or bengal, tamilnadu tathaa gujarat main pita kaa swatv pehle mana jaataa he
 Mitakshara considers the right relationship only in the right and the right-wing verb
 mitakshra 'pind' shabd kaa arth sharir karke sapind se saat pidiyon ke bheetar ek hi kul kaa praani grahan karti he, par daybhag iskaa ek hi pind se sambhddha arth karke naati, naanaa, mamaa ityadi ko bhi le letaa he
 The main salient distinction between Mitakshara and Daibhaga is shown below: mitakshra ke anusaar paitruk dhan par putradi kaa saamaanya swatv unke janm hi ke saath utpann ho jaataa he, par daybhag purvaswami ke swatvvinaash ke uparaant uttaradhikariyon ke swatv kii utpatti maanata he
 According to Mitakshara, before the department, the common possessions of each included creature are on the entire property, whether it is latent or indefinite due to non-sharing of share
 mitakshra ke anusaar koi hissedaar kutumb sampatti ko apane nij ke kaam ke liye bai yaa rehan nahin kar saktaa par daybhag ke anusaar vah apane anishchit ansh ko bantwaare ke pehle bhi bech saktaa he
 According to Mitakshara, the wealth which is the common wealth of many beings, is the establishment department of the separate possessions of one owner in any country or part of it
 daybhag ke anusaar vibhaag pruthak swatv kaa vyanjan maatr he
 According to Mitakshara, the son may ask the father to distribute the ancestral property, but according to Daibhaga, the son does not have such right
 mitakshra ke anusaar stri apane mrit pati kii uttaradhikarini tabhi ho sakati he jab uskaa pati bhai aadi kutumbiyon se alag ho
 But in the realm, whether the husband is separated or involved, the woman is the heiress
 daybhag ke anusaar kanya yadi vidhwaa, vandhya yaa aputravati ho to vah uttaradhikarini nahin ho sakati
 Mitakshara does not have such a restriction
 yajyavlky, naarad aadi ke anusaar paitruk dhan kaa vibhaag in avasaron par hona chahie— pita jab chaahe tab, mata kii rajonivritti or pita kii vishaynivruti hone par, pita ke mrit, patit yaa sanyasi hone par

 Similarly, the word Kalan is associated with many villages like Kosi Kalan, Bamaniya Kalan
 jis tarah khurd shabd chote yaa laghu kaa paryaay bana usee tarah kalam shabd bade yaa vishaal kaa paryaay bana
 Kalan was used in almost the same sense as the word Greater India was used in ancient times for India which covered the entire territory from Burma to Iran

 Pan Am Flight 73 was a Boeing 747-121 flight by Pan American World Airways, which was hijacked by four armed Palestinian militants from the Abu Nidal Organization in Karachi, Pakistan, on 5 September 1986

 He asked Thexton if he was a soldier and whether he had a gun

 He then asked Thexton to kneel down and told the officers that if someone came close to the plane, he would kill another passenger
 viraph daroga ne use bataaya ki vimaan main ek kru sadsy he jo cockpit kaa radio kaa prayog kar saktaa he or uske madhyam se aage baatcheet kii ja sakati he
 Safarini went back to Thexton and asked if he needed water
 thexton ne kaha - haan
 Safarini also asked if she was married and claimed that she did not like violence and all this killing, but the US and Israel had taken over their country and they could not live their life

 The hijack episode lasted through the night

 At around 9 pm, the auxiliary power unit was shut down, all the lights were extinguished and the emergency light burned
 Passengers at the front were order toward the back, while passengers at the back were ordered forward
 Since the aisles were already full of passengers, those passengers standing just sat down
 With the plane out of power and sitting in near darkness a hijacker at the 1L door said a prayer and then aimed to shoot at the explosive belt the other hijacker at the 1R door was wearing
 The intent was to cause an explosion massive enough to kill all passengers and crew on board, as well as themselves
 Since the cabin was so dark, the hijacker missed causing only a small detonation
 Immediately the hijackers began shooting their weapons into the cabin at passengers and attempted to throw their grenades
 Yet again the lack of light caused them to not pull pins fully and create small explosions
 Ultimately it was their bullets that created most damage since each bullet would bounce off the aircraft and create crippling shrapnel
 The flight attendant at the 3L door decided it was time to take action and opened the door and although the slide did not deploy several passengers jumped down the 15 ft to the Tarmac, including crew
 The passenger that was near 3R had read the page the flight attendant earlier gave him and was able to successfully open that door
 It was the only door opened to have the slide deploy
 Ultimately this slide allowed for more passengers to evacuate safely and without injuries
 Neerja Bhanot assisted a number of passengers to escape from the flight, then she laid down her life shielding three children from the bullets fired by the terrorists
 Twenty passengers were killed and over a hundred were injured, but many escaped the ordeal including Michael Thexton, who came close to death a few hours before and returned to the UK pakistan ne turant es es ji divizan bheji tathaa army rangers ko taiyaar rahane ko kaha
 The incident escalated towards the end when the hijackers opened fire on the passengers of the aircraft

 jab prakaash yaa dhwani tarange kisi avrodh se takaraati hai, to ve avrodh ke kinaaron par mud jaati hai or avarohak ke kii jyamitiya chaaya main pravesh kar jati hai
 The phenomenon of this type of waves is called diffraction
 aisa paaya gaya he ki laghu aakaar ke avarodhon se takaraane ke baad tarangen mud jaatin hai tathaa jab laghu aakaar ke chhidron se hokar tarang guzarati he to yah fail jaati he
 All types of waves cause diffraction
 yadi kisi prakashotpadak strot or parde ke bich koi apaardarshak vastu rakh di jaae, to parde par vastu kii chaaya ban jaati he
 Often the edge of the shadow is sharp and the part of the curtain around it is evenly illuminated
 yadi prakashotpadak strot binduvat chota ho, to dhyaan se dekhne par chaaya kaa kinaaraa tikshn nahin paaya jaataa he
 Streaks of light and darkness are seen on the shore
 aisa maaloom hota he ki prakaash kii kirane mudakar jyamitiya chaaya kii seemaa ke bheetar tak pahunch gai hai
 This phenomenon is called diffraction of light
 chaaya ke kinare-kinare jo dhaariyaan banati hai, unhen vivartan pattern kaha jaataa he
 Before the information of diffraction, it was believed that light moves in straight lines in any one medium
 kintu vivartan kii vyakhya prakaash ke saral raikhik gaman ke aadhaar par nahin kii ja sakati he
 Newton, Grimaldi and T
 Young first noted the incident
 newton or greemaldi prakaash ke kanika siddhant ke pravartak or anuyaayi the, at: unhone vivartan kii ghatana ko isi aadhaar par samajhane kaa asafal prayaas kiya
 The Christian hygge later proposed the wave theory of light and A
 J
 Frennel and Fraunhofer successfully explained diffraction and other phenomena related to diffraction based on this principle
 jab prakaash ke maarg main gol chhed, ytaakar rekhachhidr, kisi vastu kii tikshn kor yaa maheen taar rakhaa jaataa he, tab prayek dasha main bhinn prakaar ke vivartan pattern banate hai
 All diffraction events can be divided into two divisions: frounhophar vivartan or frenel vivartan 
 When the light source and the curtain are extremely far away from the reflecting object, that is, the plane waveform is deflected on the diffractor, then the diffraction pattern is called the Fraunhofer pattern and the phenomenon is the Fraunhofer diffraction
 jab strot, pardaa, yaa ye donon, vivartak vastu se niyat duuri par hote hai, arthath vivartak par goleey yaa belanaakaar tarangagra aaptit hota he, tab vivartan kii ghatana ko frenel vivartan kaha jaataa he
 Frennel diffraction is relatively easy to see, but difficult to understand
 frounhophar vivartan dekhne ke liye vishesh prakaar kii vyavastha kerani padati he, jisase samtal tarangagra praapt ho
 After diffraction, it has to arrange to refocus, but its principle is very simple to understand
 fronhopher vivartan:- esa vivartan jisamen prakaash shrot tathaa pardaa avarohak se anant duuri par ho
 a monochromatic light of yellow color is obtained from sodium lap
 ek lens kii sahaayta se is prakaash ko ek kaale parden main kate hue atyant sankare rekhachhidr par daalaa jaae, to yahi rekhachhidr swayan ek prakaash strot kaa kaam detaa he
 Now by putting the lens in front of this line, parallel beam is placed on each other line and white curtain is placed behind this line, then the diffraction pattern of the other line is formed on the screen
 is pattern ke bich main atyant teevr band yaa pattee hoti he
 More bandages of comparatively lesser intensity are found on both sides of this bandage
 bichwali pattee ko mukhya ucchishth tathaa anya pattiyon ko dwitiyak ucchishth kehete hai
 The diffraction pattern of two contiguous lines is somewhat different from the diffraction pattern of a line
 ek rekhachhidr ke pattern main jahaan jahaan ucchishth miltaa he, do rekhachhidr ke pattern main unheen sthanon par kai dhaariyaan banati hai, jo pehle ke bandon kii apeksha adhik patali or tikshn hoti hai
 As the number of line-holes increases, the stripes of the secondary superior attenuate and the stripes of the main superior become sharper
 rekhachhidron kii chaudaai tathaa unki parsparik duuri bhi in dhariyon kii tikshnata ko bahut prabhavit karti he
 If the lines are drawn with a diamond blade on a flat glass strip, the translucent space between each of the two lines acts as a perforation
 aise hi rekhachhidron ke samooh ko granting kehete hai
 Grating was invented by Fraunhofer
 unhone do scru ke upar maheen taar lapetakar grating banaaya tha
 The space between each two wires acts as a line defect
 aage chalakar unhone kaanch ke plate par rekhaayen khinchakar grating banaaya
 Roland created the grating line in 1882
 aajkal acchhee mashiinon dwaara ek inch par 30,000 yaa 40,000 tak rekhaayen khinchi jaati hai
 If the monochromatic parallel rays are placed on a grating by placing the lens in front of a light source, the sharpness of the diffraction is found to be several sharp lines away from each other
 ye rekhaayen vastav main rekhachhidr strot kaa vivartan bimb hoti hai
 The most intense line in the middle is called zero line
 iske donon ore pehali, duusari, teesri aadi rekhaayen kramash: pratham, dwitiya tathaa tritiy koti kii rekhaayen kehalaati hai
 If white light is applied to the grating, the zero-grade line is white, but spectrums are obtained at other places
 inhen kramash: pratham, dwitiya, tritiy aadi koti ke spectrum kaha jaataa he
 If the wavelength of the light being radiated by the grating is l, the incidence angle i and the diffraction angle q of the incident waveform and the reciprocal distance d of the midpoints of any two contiguous lines, then d d = n l hota he
 n denotes the order of the spectrum
 upar jis grating kaa vivaran diya gaya he, use samtal vivartan grating kehete hai
 If the aluminum glass is cut on a curved glass and the lines are scraped with a diamond blade, the area between each two lines acts as a tiny reflective mirror
 in bhaagon se paravartit tarangon ke vyatikaran se bhi vivartan pattern banataa he
 This grating is called concave grating
 iskaa avishkaar rolland ne kiya tha
 Concave grating also acts as a concave mirror
 at: vivartit kirnon ko foks karne ke liye lens kaa prayog nahin karnaa padataa he
 Large useful spectrographs have been created from curve grating to obtain spectrum in spectroscopy
 vakr grating ke liye bhi tarangadairghy kaa sutara d = n l hi hota he
 The ability to separate the rings of two different characters from each other is called the grafting capacity of the grating
 yadi l1- l2 = Dl ho or inke vivartan kone kramash: q1 or q2 hon tathaa q1 - q2 = Dq ho, to grating kii varna vikshepan kshamta hoti he
 Its value is derived from the formula of wavelength
 kramash: ucchtar koti main varna vikshepan kshamta badhati jaati he
 If l and l + dl are two very proximal radiation and can be seen separately from each other by grating, then dl is called the resolution of grating
 n grating par bani hui kul rekhaon kii sankhya he
 Differential capacity also increases in higher order respectively
 franelle vivartan :-esa vivartan jis main prakaash shrot tathaa pardaa avarohak yaa dwarak se simit duuri par ho
 The formation of diffraction patterns at the edge of the shadow cannot be explained by simple linear movement of light
 ise samajhane ke liye franelle ne tarang siddhant kaa upyog kiya
 To explain the effect of different points in a waveform, he proposed the principle of half-time zone
 is siddhant ke aadhaar par banaaya gaya zone plate lens kii bhanti kaam karata he or frenel ke siddhant kii pushti karata he
 If a very small hole has a monochromatic plane waveform, its diffraction pattern is formed on the screen
 is pattern main vrittakar dhaariyaan pai jaati hai
 The outermost strips are the thickest and the inner stripes are thinner respectively
 frenel ke ardhakaal zone ke aadhaar par is vivartan kii vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 If the size of the hole is equal to the first half zone and the distance between the center of the pattern and the circumference of the hole is l / 2, the center of the pattern is illuminated
 yadi parde se chhidr kii duuri sthir rakhkar chhidr kaa aakaar badhaate jaaen, to yah centre kramash: prakashit or aprakashit hota he
 When the shape of the hole covers the half-zone, the center of the pattern is bright and when the hole consists of 2m half-zone, the center is black
 chhidr ko sthir rakhkar parden ko usase sameep yaa dur laane par bhi centre par parivartan hota he

 In fact, it is so difficult to understand this strange behavior of particles that if a person fully understands it, then he will be called a great scientist
 mahavaigyanik richard phenman ne swayan kaha tha ki koi vyakti "kwantum yantriki" ko puri tarah nahin samaj saktaa
 But many uses of this bizarre effect have been found, such as it helps in the migration of the European Robin, it can also revolutionize the field of computing that can do the largest number of calculations in seconds and new evidence is found Is that plants obtain their energy by using quantum entanglement

 So let's read - the best speech ever by Steve Jobs, in Hindi: Steve Jobs convocation speech at Stanford "stay Hungry Stay Foolish" "thank you! Today, when i joined the convocation of one of the world's best universities, Feeling proud aapako ek sach bataa duun main; main kabhi kisi college se paas nahin hua; or aaj pehali baar main kisi college ke snaatak samaaroh ke itnaa kareeb pahunchaa hoon
 Today i would like to tell you three stories of my life


 nothing more but three stories
 meri pehali kahani binduon ko jodne ke bare main he
 i quit my studies within 6 months of joining Reid College, but i kept coming there somehow until 18 months after that
 to sawaal uthta he ki maine college kyon choda? asal main, isaki shuruyaat mere janm se pehle kii he
 My biological mother * was a young, unmarried graduate student, and wanted to give me someone else for adoption
 par unki ek khwaish thi ki koi college kaa snaatak hi mujhe apanaaye kare
 Everything was fine and i was about to be adopted by a lawyer and his wife that suddenly the couple changed their mind and decided they wanted a girl
 isliye tab aadhi-raat ko merehone vaale mata pita,phone karke se poocha gaya, "hamaare paas ek ladkaa he, kya aap use god lenaa chahenge?" or unhone jhat se haan kar di
 Later my mother came to know that my mother is not close to college and father is not even close to high school
 isliye unhone god lene ke kagajaat par hastakshar karne se manaa kar diya; par kuch mahino baad mere hone vaale mata-pita ke mujhe college bhejne ke aashwaasan dene ke ke baad wo maan gayin
 So my life started like this and after seventeen years i went to college
 

 
par galati se maine stenford jitna hi mahangaa college chun liya
 My job occupation started to accumulate in my studies
 6 maheene baad mujhe is padhai main koi mulya nahin dikhaa
 i did not understand what i wanted to do in my life, and how the college would help me in this
 
or upar se main apni mata-pita kii jivan bhar ki kamai kharch karata ja rahaa tha
 So i decided to drop out of college
 

 or sochaa jo hoga acha hoga
 At that time all this was very scary for me, but when i look back, i think it was the best decision of my life
 jaise hi maine college choda mere upar se zaruri kakshaon karne kii baadhyataa khatm ho gayi
 And i just started doing classes of my interest
 ye sab kuch itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 i had no room to stay, so i had to sleep on the floor in a friends room
 main coke kii bottle ko lautaane se milane vaale paison se khaanaa khaataa tha
 

 i used to walk 7 miles every Sunday to Hare Krishna temple, so that i could eat food at least once a week
 yah mujhe kaaphi acha lagata tha
 Whatever i did in my life because of my curiosity and intuition later proved invaluable to me
 yahaan main ek udhaaharan dena chaahoonga
 At that time Reed College was probably the best place in the world where Khushakt * was taught
 puure parisar main har ek poster, har ek label badi khubsuurati se haanthon se sulikhit hota tha
 Since i had dropped out of college, there was no need for me to do normal classes
 maine tay kiya kii main sulekh kii kakshaen karunga or ise acchhee tarah se sikhuunga
 i learned about serif and sans serif type-face; It is also learned how to make beautiful typed shapes by creating spaces and increasing the space between different letter combinations
 yah khubasurat tha, itnaa kalatmak tha ki ise vigyaan dwaara kabja nahin kiya ja saktaa tha, or ye mujhe behad acha lagata tha
 At that time there was no hope that i would ever use these things in my life
 lekin jab das saal baad ham pehla Macintosh computer bana rahe the tab maine ise mike main dizin kar diya
 And Mac became the world's first computer with beautiful typography
 agar maine college se drop out nahin kiya hota to main kabhi mike bahu-tipaphase anupatik rup se sthaan diya gaya phont nahin hote, to shaayad kisi bhi nijee computer main ye chijen nahin hotin
 If i had never dropped out, i would never have done those calligraphy classes and then probably the fonts that are in the personal computer would not have existed
 beshak, jab main college main tha tab bhavishya main dekh kar in binduon kojod kar dekhnaa asambhav tha; lekin das saal baad jab main peeche mud kar dekhtaa hoon to sab kuch bilkul saafe nazar aata he
 You can never add these points by looking into the future
 aap sirf ateet dekhakar hi in binduon ko jod sakate hai; isliye aapako yakeen karnaa hoga kii abhi jo ho rahaa he vah aage chal kar kisi na kisi tarah aapke bhavishya se jud jaayegaa
 You have to believe in something or the other - in your courage, in your destiny, in your life or in your actions


 you have to believe in something
 

 kyonki is baat main vishwaas karte rahanaa kii aage chal kar binduon kojod sakenge jo aapako apane dil kii awaz sunne kii himmat degaa
 

 even when you are walking on a completely different path
 

 or kaha ki fark padegaa

 vartmaan satta-vidyaman shaasha, 6 farvari varsh 1952 se maharani elizabeth dwitiya hai
 Tuvalu's political system, like other Commonwealth countries, is based on the Westminster system, in which the position of head of state is nominal, and the real administrative powers are vested at the head of state
 tuvaalu saidhantik rup se ek rajtantr he, or tuvaalu ke shaasha ke padaadhikari iske rashtrapramukh hote hai, haalaanki shaasha kii sari sanvaidhanik shaktiyon kaa abhyaas, unke pratinidhi ke rup main, tuvaalu ke governor-general karte hai
 If the woman is a woman, she is referred to as the "queen of Tuvalu", and a male lady is referred to as the "king of Tuvalu"

 Gradually these colonies were given sovereignty over their administration, and by the Statute of Westminster, 1931 all these states were given full equal status within the Commonwealth
 jo purv upnivesh, british shaasha ko aaj bhi apana shaasha maanate he, un deshon ko rashtramandal prajabhumi yaa rashtramandal pradesh kaha jaataa he
 As the prominent parallel heads of many of these nations, the British academies also find themselves with the title of head of the Commonwealth

 The bill received royal assent on 23 April 2013, and came into force on March 2015 after the passage of the relevant legislation in all Commonwealth territories

 Pratyabhigya philosophy is a branch of Kashmiri Shaivism
 yah 9veen shatabdi main janma ek advaitavaadi darshan he
 The name of this philosophy is based on the name of the book titled Ishvatrayapratibhyagarkarika composed by Utpaldev
 pratybhigna kaa shabdic arth he- pehle se dekhe hue ko pahchaanana, yaa, pehle se dekhi hui vastu kii tarah kii koi duusari vastu dekhakar uskaa gyaan praapt karnaa
 According to Pratibhyana, this world is made up of thirty-six elements
 maheshwar arthath param satta, apni swatantra ichha se apane maanas patal par inhen tattvon ko kabhi samavet rup main prakat kar detaa he, or kabhi apane main samet letaa he
 This is called 'unmilan' and 'nimilan' in other words
 maheshwar athwa shiv ke us puure kaaryaklap ko panchakrutya kii sangya di jaati he
 Shiva does all this with his will, hence it is called his freedom power
 isi ko maheshwarya shakti athwa vimarsh bhi kehete hai
 Discussion means activism
 advait veydant ke brahm kii bhaanti is darshan kii paramsatta, shiv, keval prakashmay hi nahin apitu prakaash vimarshmay he
 It is the place of both knowledge and action and the source of both
 pratybhigna darshan ke anusaar yah vishwa koi nai rachana nahin, balki pehle se hi vidyaman vastu prakatikaran he
 The Pratibhagya philosophy neither considers an object to be false nor transitory
 isaki drushti main prayek vastu kii apni satta he, balki satta hi vastu kii niamak he
 That is, if there is an object then it will surely have power and if it does not have power then it is not an object
 inke anusaar to vastu, vastu kaa karta or vastubodh kaa madhyam teenon hi yatharth hai
 This is Shaivism
 kashmir kaa advait shaiva darshan teen mukhya naamon se prakhyat he - Pratibhigya philosophy - It is called 'pratibhigya philosophy' because it believes that it is monotheistic but forgetting its form, it establishes the country and soul
 apane sachche swaroop kii se vah parichhinn, kritrim ahan se advaitalabh karata he
 Spandashastra - It got its name 'spandashastra' because the essence that the whole world originated from the power of Shiva is Spandrupa
 trik pratybhigna - isko trikdarshan isaliye kehete hai ki isi kaa mukhyatya pratipaadan kiya gaya he: Male, Shiva, kahin-kahin Animals, loop and husband, are thus considered objects
 mukhyarth ek hi he
 This philosophy is monotheistic
 durvasa or tryambak iske aadi prachaarak maane jate hai
 It is also called ‘triyambak Darshan’
 iske mul pravartak acharya vasugupt the jinhone iske siddhanton ko lipibaddh kiya
 Kshemraj says in 'shivasutra' that Lord Srikanth ordered Vasugupta in a dream, Shivasutra is placed on a rock of Mahadevagiri, preach
 jis shila par ye shivasutra uddankit mili the kashmir main log shivapal kehete hai
 The number of this is 77
 ye hi is darshan ke mul aadhaar hai
 In "spandakarika", two disciples were born of the principles of Sivasutras, Kallat and Somananda
 "spandasrvasv" likhaa or somanand ne "shivadrushti" or 'paraatarti' likhi
 Somananda had sons and disciples Utpalacharya
 abhinavgupt atyant pratibhashali the
 Poetry, drama, music, philosophy, tantra, mantra and yoga were well versed in them
 dhvanyalok par jo "lochan" tikaa he vah is marmagrata kaa prachur pramaan he
 His "bharati" commentary on the Natyashastra of Bharata is a testimony to his knowledge of theatrical and musical
 "pratybhigyavimarshini" inke darshan ke agaadh paanditya kaa pramaan he, "malinivijayvarthik" inke aagam ke gambhir gyaan kaa tathaa "parmarthasar" inke darshan or sadhana ke paanditya udhaaharan he
 His "tantraloka", written in 12 parts, is a large dictionary of philosophy and yoga
 "tantrasaar" main tantralok "tantrasaar" main tantralok kaa nichod he
 Kshemraj was his very well-qualified disciple
 kshemraj ke nimnlikhit granth prasiddh hai : shivasutravimarshini, svachhand tantra, vigyanbhairav or netratantr par udyot tikaa, pratybhigyahruday spandasandoh, spandanirnay, parapraveshika, tatvasandoh or shivastotrawali par "stavchintamani" tikaa
 The following more texts were written on his inter-representation
 utpal vaishnav kii "spandpradipika" bhaskar or varadaraj kaa "shivasutravarthik", raamakant kii "spandkarikavivritti", yograj kii "parmarthvivruti" or jayrath kii tantralok kii "vivek" tikaa
 Ultimate Element: The vision of this philosophy is Advaita or Advaita
 param tatv dwaitarahit yaa advay he
 He has been designated with the words Parameshwara, Paramashiva, Chitparasvitta, Anantara etc
 chit vah he jo apane ko sab aavarnon se dhakkar bhi sadaa anaavruth bana rahata he, sab parivartanon ke bheetar bhi sadaa parivartanrahit bana rahata he
 There is no dualism of Pramata theorem, Vedak Vedya, because there is nothing other than that
 iskaa swaroop prakashvimarshmay he
 Shankar Vedanta also considers Chitta to be Advaita, but in Shankar Vedanta, Chit is only light, it is illuminating in Pratibhagya philosophy
 mani bhi prakashrup he
 Merely speaking as a form of light cannot be a representation of the divine
 trik yaa pratybhigna darshan kaa kahana he ki param tatv vah prakaash he jise apane prakaash kaa vimarsh bhi he
 "discourse" is a technical term
 iskaa arth he chit kii atmachetana, prakaash kaa atmagyaan, prakaash kaa yah gyaan ki "main hoon"
 Mani is also self-illuminated, but he has no knowledge of his light
 paramtatv ko keval swayamprakash kah dene se kaam nahin chalegaa
 Pratibhagya philosophy says that such a light which has its own knowledge is conversational
 vimarsh chetana kii chetana he
 Kshemraj called the discourse "akritrimamaham iti visfuranam" as a natural ego
 kritrim ahan hri "aswabhaavik main" kaa gyaan vedyasaapeksh he
 Discourse is complete knowledge of the natural ego, it is "completelessness", because the whole world is in it
 usase vyatirikt kuch he hi nahin
 Kshemaraja has said "if Nirvimarsha: Siyat Anishvaro Jdash Prajjyate means that if the supreme element was just light and not conversational, then it would become insensible and root
 chit apane ko chitshakti ke rup main dekhtaa he
 Chitra's view of itself in this form is called discourse
 isi vimarsh ko is shaastra ne parashakti, parawak, swatantry, aishwarya, kartrutv, sphurataa, saar, hriday, spand ityadi naamon se abhihit kiya he
 When we say that the divine light is illusory, then it means that it is not just a sign, it is also a power
 yah paramtatv vishvoteern bhi he or vishvamay bhi he
 The world is an expression of Shiva's power
 pralayavastha main yah bhakthi shiv main sanhrut rahati he, sristi or sthiti main yah shakti vishvakar main vyakt rahati he
 The world is inseparable from Paramashiva, it is the memory of Shiva
 parameshwar yaa paramshiv bina kisi upadan ke, bina kisi aadhaar ke, apane swatantry se, apni swechha se, apni hi bhitti yaa aadhaar main vishwa kaa unmolan karata he
 The painter makes a painting on some basis, with the help of paintbrush and color, but the painter, base, paintbrush, color of this world painting is all Shiva
 parameshwar hi multatv he
 This philosophy is called "godlessism" because there is nothing more than God
 agyaan yaa maaya usase bhinn kuch nahin he
 This is the unconstrained form of the same
 vah apane swatantry se, apni ichha se apane ko dhak bhi letaa he
