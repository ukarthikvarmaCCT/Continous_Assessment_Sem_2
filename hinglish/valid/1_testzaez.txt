 masjiden aksar quran kii shiksha ke liye ek centre kaa kaam karti hai
 Madrasas are also maintained in many mosques which are given the responsibility of religious education
 masjidon musalamaanon kaa centre he jiskaa uddeshy keval dharmik nahin balki musalamaanon kaa saamaajik, shaikshanik or raajnneetik centre masjiden rahi hai
 Bazamat prayers play a very important role in the relationship, reconciliation and status tracking of Muslims
 is ke alaava masjidon yudhon or anya apatkaaleen sthitiyon main ek panaahagaah kaa kaam karti rahi hai

 masjidon vah jagah hai jahaan se pehali vishvavidhyalayon ne janm liya jaise jamiya aalazehar, jamiya karviin, jamiya zayatonia aadi

 Some mosques have Islamic centers where research centers are established, along with Dini and Daniyawi education

 Revolutionary movements took place in mosques for centuries as they have been an important source of contact with Muslims
 aadhunik daur main bhi masjidon kii raajnneetik bhoomika kii andekhi nahin kar saktaa jo spasht udhaaharan laal masjid islamabad kii he
 Governments have also been using Daran for mosques and mosques for their own purposes
 praarambhik masjidon bahut saral thi or manjila saadhaaran imaarat bhi shaamil hoti thi jiske saath koi minar yaa gumbad aavashyak nahin tha

 shuruyaat masjide nabavi khajur ke tanon ke stambhon or paton kii chat se nirmaan hua tha
 The Kaaba was a square building made of stone around which worship was done in the open premises
 lekin samay ke saath musalamaanon sansaadhan padhate chale gaye or unhone apni jarurat or kshetra kii samskruti ke anusaar masjid nirmaan kii
 Expensive works in mosques and lofty towers and domes began to be built later
 minar ke kaaran yah tha ki masjid dur se dikhaai, is par chadhakar azaan di awaz dur tak aae or kshetra kii samskruti or kala kii jhalak thi
 From the dome the voice of the speech and prayer of the mosque speaker was spread throughout the mosque with an echo and beauty
 islam chunki jivit chizon kii tasviren protsaahit nahin isliye masjid kii tazain ke liye quran aayaat kaa vibhinn sundar tareeke se istemaal kiya gaya or vibhinn jaumitrek dizin bhi kiye gaye
 Due to the glimpses of time, necessity and culture, many things in the mosque became almost essential such as minarets, domes, a courtyard in the mosque, wuzu fountains, halls for namaz etc
 iske alaava aksar masjid ke hamaam, pustaken box, mb or kuch masjidon ke saath madrason, anusandhan kendra yaa niyamit vishvavidhyalayon shaamil hai
 The minaret is the main hallmark of the mosque which the mosque can be seen from a distance
 mukhya rup se minar par chadhakar azaan di jaati thi jisase awaz dur tak jaati thi lekin ab azaan masjid ke bheetar se kiya jaataa he kyonki lavad spikar se awaz ko dur dur tak pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 Not tall at the height of the mosque tower
 yah bahut chota bhi ho saktaa he or bahut ooncha bhi
 Small mosques in Europe do not have towers because they often have one or two rooms
 sabase lanbaa minar masjid hasan samiksha, kasabalanka, morocco kaa samajha jaataa he jo 210 meter ooncha he
 Initially the mosque did not have minarets and they were very simple but soon the minarets became almost part of the mosque
 musalamaanon par aarope lagaaya he ki minar kitaoon ke minar dekhakar banaae gaye lekin yah sahi nahin he kyonki arab nirmaan main pehle hi se minar banate the khaskar vibhinn raksha kilon ke saath minar dur tak dekhne ke liye banaae jate the

 menaron kii prakaar vibhinn deshon main alag hai
 In Pakistan, India and Iran, the towers are usually round and thick
 turki main lagbhag minar gol par kam motaai vaale hote hai
 Many minaret thieves occur in Sham and Egypt
 misr main hashat pahalu minar bhi milte hai
 But other types of minarets are also found in all these above countries
 menaron ke upar laal, firoz yaa anya pad va nigaar bhi banaae jate hai jo unki khubsuurati bad jaataa he
 Some minarets in Iran and Iraq are made of golden color, on the top of which there has been a rough investment made of real gold
 gumbad aajkal kii masjidon kaa lagbhag hissaa anivaary hai
 The main purpose of the dome is not just beauty but it makes the voice of the speaker mosque resonate throughout the mosque
 iske alaava ab gumbad masjidon kii pahchaan ban chuki he
 Hazrat Mohammed Sallallahu Alaihi and equipment and slimness is in the Mubarak Mosque Nabvi which is very famous green dome
 rauza mubarak kii tasviren sabase pramukh yahi gumbad he
 Movement independence in Palestine is also the hallmark of independence independence Palestine when located in Haram Ghodsi Alsharif
 yah musalamaanon kaa shaayad sabase purana sthapit gumbad he
 Some people consider him a mosque, which is wrong
 iran main masjid bahut khubasurat gumbad nirmaan hue hai
 Such as Masjid Imam, Isfahan's dome or mosque agencies Shad, Mashhad's dome
 The subcontinent Pak and the Indian dome are also competent deed
 sindh main arabon ke aagaman ke baad kai masjidon nirmaan hui jinke saath saral lekin bade gumbad the magar baad main mughal baadshahon ne badi shandaar masjidon nirmaan kin jaise rajya masjid lahore, pakistan ke safed gumbad bahut hi sundar or bade hai
 The domes of the Babri Masjid built in the desert were also very large, which were martyred by Hindu terrorists
 aadhunik daur main nirmaan hone karachi, pakistan kii masjidobi kaa gumbad ek gumbad masjidon main sabase bada he jo 72 meter vyas kaa he or bina kisi stambh ke nirmaan hua he
 The Salimaya Mosque Adarna, Turkey's dome, built in 1557 AD, is 27
2 meters in diameter and is also one of the world's largest gunfights
 yah gumbad purana hone ke baavjood itnaa majboot he ki 1915 i
 kii balgaria kii topon kii bambaari se bhi nahin tutaa or keval aantarik parat ko nuksaan pahunchaa
 The largest gunfights in the world also include the dome of Masjid Sultan Salahuddin Aziz, Malaysia, which is 170 feet in diameter
 yaad rahe ki gumbad keval masjidon par nahin hote balki america, vishvavidhyalayon or kuch jaanch kendron par bhi dekhe ja sakate hai
 There is also a beautiful sculpture on the interior of gunbeds and Quranic imports are often written
 kuch ganabadon main shishe lage hote hai jisase roshni andar sakati he
 Most of the interior sculpture of the dome is done in dark blue, Firozabad or red as these colors can be seen by people standing under the dome in high gunbeds
 pracheen masjidon ke bade angan hai jaise masjid haraam or masjide nabavi ke angan bahut bade hai jinamein samay ke saath vistaar aayaa he
 Millions of people can undoubtedly offer prayers in these tolerance
 lahore kii rajya masjid kaa angan bhi bahut bada he jisamen ek samay main ek lakh ke kareeb log namaaz pard sakate hai
 Apart from the namaz, there were sure to be mosques in the old-time mosques for wuzu
 kuch talab aise bane hote the jinamein barish pani nather kar jaataa tha
 An example of this is Jama Alakeroan Alakbar, the ancient mosque of Tayunas
 bade sahanon or unke bich hoje ek or udhaaharan jama masjid isiahaan, iran he
 The courtyard of the Sultan Mosque Burujardi, Iran is also very large, with three buildings surrounding it
 samarkand main amir timore banaae hue masjid bibisi kanam kaa angan bhi bade sahanon suchi main shaamil hai
 Jamia Alazhar and Egypt itself are very large courtyards of a mosque
 uddeshy yah suchi bahut lambii he
 There are hoses in all tolerance and some have fountains
 kuch masjidon jaise masjid paris ke hamaam bhi hai
 The mosque usually has a large room or hall special for prayers, which does not have much equipment but beautiful and comfortable carpets are laid out so that more and more people can easily offer prayers
 isamen aamtaur mehrab or mimber bhi hote hai
 In the arch that is the place, the Imam provides the namaz party and the speaker gives a speech on Mimbar
 mimber aamtaur lakdi ke banaae jate the
 The oldest wooden mimber is in the extensive Alcaroan highlands, Tayunas, which belong to the first century Hijri
 aajkal lakdi ke alaava cement or kankarat se mimber banaae jate hai jinke upar sang maramar laga he
 In mosques, the center is a large room that is specific to the namaz, usually equipped with uncountable pillars as pillars are needed to support the roof of very large rooms
 magar stambhon kaa uddeshy keval chat ko sahaara dena nahin balki isse masjid kii sundarataa main bhi vruddhi hoti he
 Some mosques such as Masjid Kartabah become famous because of their pillars
 stambhon ke nirmaan main musalamaanon ne gyaan alhindasah ke mahaan utkrisht janm diya he
 Some mosques, such as Jama Alakroon Alakbar, have more than four hundred pillars
 masjide nabavi ke kuch stambh to aise hai jo puraane hai or is baat kii pahchaan karte hai ki masjide nabavi hazarat mohammad sa upkaran or slim ke daur mubarak main kahaan tak thi
 Some columns are new
 masjide nabavi or masjidul haraam ke stambh bhi anginat hai
 In the usual view of the Namaz, carpet will be seen throughout the room with many pillars and beautiful arches and mimbers, which are usually dark red or white
 haal main vibhinn konon main topayon jagah nazar aati he
 Apart from this, there would be Quran and other religious books lying in various shelves along the walls
 aadhunik masjidon or kuch pracheen badi masjidon main kuch kursiyaan bhi nazar aati hai par aise log baithte jo buudhe yaa anya samasyaon kii vajah se zamin par nahin baith sakate
 The mosque is a place of reverence for the Muslim who loves Allah unceasingly
 sadiyon se masjidon quran aayaat or anya nakaashi kaa utkrisht banati rahi hai
 Because Islam does not encourage the making of photographs of living things, other criteria of mosques were used
 masjidon par nakaashi ke liye gaade rangon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jinamein firoz, gaharaa nila, sunaharaa or laal rang adhik milte hai
 Among mosques such as the Marines built in the subcontinent, the Mongols and the Sepoys in Iran and Central Asia, the mosques built in Morocco, Tayunas, Egypt, etc
, and mosques in Iraq and other Arab regions, all of which have rank and status for centuries
 The climate is firmly established
 purv kii garm rayatali hua yaa barish in rangon kaa kuch nahin bigaad saki
 The invading army was spoiled, especially the crucifixion
 aadhunik daur main 1993 ke lagbhag bosnia main saikadon khubasurat masjidon ko nasht kiya gaya jinamein se kai kala nirmaan utkrisht thim magar itani pracheen masjidon kii tabaahi par pashchimi sansthaaon ne kan baraabar bhi chintaa vyakt nahin kiya

 turki kii kai masjidon ko sangrahalay gharon main badal diya gaya he jaise pehle masjid aayaa dafaya yahaan jo tasviir di gai he usamen lagata gumbad ke punarnirmaan kii ja rahi he lekin vastav main is se musalamaanon ke nakaashi or khaati ko hataakar iske neeche puraane asaar search kiye ja rahe hai kyonki turki main islam failane se pehle yah america thi
 Many mosques in Central Asia were closed during the Russian occupation and the world did not give mosques the status of archeology at the time, so it was destroyed
 unki suraksha par kuch kaam ho rahaa he
 Modern mosques do not have such beds, sculptures and hard work
 musalamaanon ke liye masjid main nimnlikhit baton kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak mana jaataa he
 If any non-muslim wants to enter the mosque, the same thing applies to them
 islam main tahaarat bahut mahatv he
 According to a hadith, the Taharat is half faith
 isliye masjid main aane ke liye paak or saaf hona shart he, lekin vuzu aap masjid main aakar kar sakate hai
 Muslims often stay in mosques in Maktab concern
 It is not lawful to stay in the family
 It is also not permissible to enter such a situation in Masjid Haram and Masjid Nabvi
 libaas ke saath sharir bhi shuddh hona chahie
 Toxin of the mind is also required according to the bus i
e
 to avoid bad thoughts
 musalmaan masjid ko allaah kaa ghar samajhate hai chaahe uskaa sambandh musalamaanon ke kisi bhi samudaay se ho
 The silence and culture and poetry in the mosque are insisted that the namaz and the Quran are not disturbed
 masjidon main ladaai jhagada yaa bina jarurat daniyavi baton se bachanaa chahie haalanki samuhik maamalon par charchaa kii ja sakati he
 Running in a mosque or stepping up and talking loudly is against culture and poetry
 isi tarah koi bhi aisa kaam karnaa jisase prarthana tang hoon, acha nahin samajha jaataa, jaise pyaaj, lahasun, muuli yaa koi bu daar cheez khaakar jane se manaa kiya jaataa he or is silsile main hadison pavitra jeevani kaa hawala bhi diya jaataa he
 Must wear clean clothes in mosque
 mahilaon aisa vastra pahanakar ain jisase vah ba pardaa hoon
 Similarly men came wearing appropriate clothes
 aamtaur musalmaan kshetreey vastra ke alaava arabi vastra bhi pahananaa acha or sawab samajhate hai magar islam main vastra par aisi koi kadagan nahin he lekin vastra islam ke siddhanton ke anusaar ho
 Both men and women are allowed to visit mosques from early Islam but are given a separate place
 shari islam ke anusaar prarthana ke dauraan mahilaon kii safen purushon se peeche hai taaki purushon kii nazar mahilaon par na pade
 During the times of the Prophet sa alaihi, both men and women used to offer prayers in the mosque, although it is considered better for the honor and safety of women to offer prayers in the house
 aajkal aksar masjidon main mahilaon ke liye alag jagah bani hoti he
 The practice of visiting the mosque of the subcontinent, Pak and Indian women is negligible but it is not from Islam but from Indian society
 arab deshon or aadhunik pashchimi deshon kii mahilaayein masjidon main aati hai, namaaz padhati hai or vibhinn shaikshanik gatividhiyon main bhaag leti hai
