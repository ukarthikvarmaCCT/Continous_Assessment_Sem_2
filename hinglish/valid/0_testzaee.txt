 The Burmese script is derived from the Brahmi script but there is a lot of difference in the spelling and pronunciation of some words
 udhaaharan ke liye, Here अर्थ does not mean actual immersion, rather it means to increase the corresponding quantity
 There are several diactric marks that alter the vowel sound of a letter
 Two diacritics are used exclusively for Pali and are rarely seen elsewhere
 One or more of these accents can be added to a consonant to change its sound
 In addition, other modifying symbols are used to differentiate tone and sound, but are not considered diacritics
 burmi lipi ke romaneekaran kii chaar pranaliyaan prachlit hai
 Two of these systems can be called transliteration and the other two are stressed with pronunciation, so they can be called transcription
 lipyantaran kii pranaliyaan hai- MLC Transcription System tathaa ALA-LC Romanization bhi dekhen
 Transcription systems are BGN / PCGN romanization and the system used by John Okell
 in pranaaliyon kaa vistrut vivechan neeche kii saraniyon main diya gaya he- The romanization of syllable onsets is done as follows- Syllable rhymes kaa romaneekaran nimnavat kiya jaataa he
 In this table the Burmese character 'A' က: ipachar has been used as the basis
 In sequences with ွ or ဝ before တ်, န်, ပ်, မ် or together with ံ, the vowel pronounced is saanchaa:ipachar rather than the expected saanchaa:ipachar
 This is reflected in the BGN / PCGN and Okell transcriptions, but not in the MLCTS and ALA-LC transliterations
 The independent vowel letters are transcribed the same as the vowels formed with အ, except in ALA-LC, where those formed with အ take a preposed apostrophe: The low tone and checked tone are represented as shown in the table above
 The representation of the high tone and creaky tone varies depending on the respective syllable rhyme: sometimes they are inherent in the vowel symbol used, and sometimes they are indicated by a diacritic mark
 The ALA-LC romanization indicates these two tones explicitly only in cases where diacritic marks are used; the other three romanizations indicate them regardless of how they are spelled
 Examples: Minor syllables in Burmese contain only the vowel template: ipachar in the rhyme and do not bear tone
 They are always followed by a major syllable
 In the orthography, they are most commonly spelled as if their rhyme was: ipachar, but are often spelled in other ways
 In the MLCTS and ALA-LC systems, minor syllables are romanized exactly as they are spelled in Burmese orthography
 In the modified BGN / PCGN system and in the Okell system, minor syllables are indicated by the letter ă regardless of the Burmese orthography
 Examples: Where two consonants appear next to each other between two vowels in a romanization, use hyphens as necessary to avoid ambiguity
 For example : In many words, a written voiceless consonant is pronounced voiced when it appears after a vowel or template: ipachar
 This is indicated in the BGN-PCGN and Okell transcriptions, but not in the MLCTS and ALA-LC transliterations
 In BGN-PCGN, the letter for the voiced consonant is used; in Okell, the letter for the voiceless consonant is used but underlined

 The Weimar movement is a mixed form of perception, sensation, and romanticism
 unhone kalidas ke abhigyaan shaakuntalam kaa german bhashaa main anuwaad kiya
 Goethe had said about Abhigyan Shakuntalam- gete kaa 82 varsh lanbaa jeevankaal europea itihaas ke aise yug se sambandhit he jo badi badi krantiyon tathaa bhayankar uthal puthal kaa samay mana gaya he
 The beginning of his youth led to the rise of revolution in German literature, which resulted in a sharp opposition to old beliefs and literary principles and strongly supported the independence of the poet and artist and the revival of the old glory of national literature
 is ‘tufaani yug’ main kranti kii bhaavana ek prachand aandhi ke samaan prakat hui, jisane puraane vichaaron tathaa jarjar siddhanton ke khandhar dharashayi kar die
 After this, in the middle of his life, there was a storm of French political revolution which shook the walls of the old system and created a beautiful dream of golden age in the hearts of millions of people, although this dream proved to be just as momentary as that of Mrigamarika, because its womb This led to the emergence of Napoleon, whose fast-moving conquistadores established a kingdom of complete despair in place of hope in Europe
 Installed
 ant main apane jivan ke sandhyakaal main usne audyogic kranti ke vyapak parivartanon kaa purna anubhav kiya or us naveen aarthik vyavastha kaa udai bhi dekha jo samaaj ke puraane dhaanche ko tod phodkar dhire dhire spasht ho rahi thi
 The impression of all these experiences is evident in his works, as his sensitive heart was immediately affected by external conditions
 vah atyant bhaagyashaalee purush tha
 The shadow of lack never came in his life
 prakruti ne saundarya tathaa swasthya ke saath hi saath use bahumukhi pratibha kaa vardaan diya tha jisane use vibhinn kaaryakshetron main safal tathaa pratishthin banaaya
 He was not only a poet or artist, but also a successful scientist, seeker and philosopher
 uskaa adhikaar europe kii kai bhashaaon par tha; uski gyanpipasa aseem thi or bimer riyasat main usne apane jivan kaa bahumulya bhaag rajshasan tathaa rangamanch sanchaalan jaise uttardaayitvapurn kaamon main bitaayaa tha
 Keeping these things in mind, it will not be difficult to understand that he strengthened and enriched all parts of German literature and made such a deep and wide impact that after that hardly any eminent German poet or artist was left untouched by him
 uski sabal lekhnee ne geetkavy, mahakavy, upanyaas, naatak, tathaa aalochanatmak prabandhon kaa prachur maatra main srijan kiya or usne kisi bhi vishay ko sparsh karke apni shakti, naveenta tathaa moulikta se aprabhavit nahin choda
 His personal experiences have been incorporated into Goethe's various works and the element that binds them all in one sutra is his personality which continues to evolve over time
 isliye yah kaha ja saktaa he ki uski vibhinnkaaleen kritiyon main uskaa naitik, bauddhik tathaa aadhyatmik charit nihit he
 During the spring time of life, his feelings were intense and simple and he expressed in simple but vigorous language which seemed to be the natural outgrowth of the emotional heart
 parantu mastashk kii paripakvata ke saath hi saath bhav kii garima tathaa bhashaa kaa parishkar or chhandon kii jatilta uttarottar badhane lagi or ant main uske shabd bhaavon se bojhil ho gaye evam hriday ke bhav mastashk ke anushaasan se niyantrit hue
 This means that he made a successful attempt to co-ordinate the opposing tendencies of his personality and all his literature and philosophy preaches the sacred duty of coordination in this way
 usne is baat par vishesh jor diya ki manushya kii antarmukhi pravriti hanikaarak he or ise bahirmukhi bananaa atyaavashyak he jisase vyakti tathaa samaaj, aatma tathaa bahya prakruti main swasth saamanjasy ho sake
 This fact is found in all his works
 uske geetkavy vyaktigat prem se aarambh hote hai parantu kalantar main manushya tathaa prakruti kaa drudh sambandh unka mukhya vishay hota he-vah prakruti jo brahmamay he or jiske saath maanav kii aatma kaa atoot sambandh he kyonki sristi ke vividh praani ekta ke sutara main bandhe hai
 Her three major novels also reflect three different aspects of her development
 unamem pratham tathaa sarvaadhik prasiddhiprapt ‘varder’ hai, jo ‘romantic’ kaaleen europe kii aatma kaa prabhaavshaalee chitra he
 This is a picture of a young man who is bored with life because there is no juice or essence for him in the outer world
 uskaa hriday vichitranirashaa se ot prot he or ant main uskaa ekaakipan itnaa katu ho jaataa he ki uskaa ant aatmahatya main hi hota he
 Two of Goethe's later novels, 'wilhelm Mistar' and its later version, pave the way for the development of style as well as the harmony of the individual and society, and in the last book, the author succeeded the industrial-era social system and the problems inherent in it
 And have done live analysis
 gete kii kritiyon main naatakon kaa vishesh sthaan he or unamem mukhya hai ‘gotj’, ‘yagmaant’, ‘iffinjini’, ‘taaso’ or ‘foust’
 Suffice it to say here that 'foust' is the best symbol of Goethe's talent and an invaluable gem of world literature
 isaki rachana kaa itihaas ‘gete’ ke vikaas kaa itihaas he or naatak ke nayak kii jeevanakatha maanav aatma ke vikaas kii katha he
 'faust' is a pre-requisite character of medieval folklore, which Goethe has considered a symbol of humanity
 yah vyakti aarambh main varder ke hi samaan ahambhaav se aakraant he parantu dhire dhire uskaa man anya vyaktiyon tathaa bahya sansar kii ore aakrisht hota he
 The first phase is the love of an innocent girl whose end proves to be miserable, then her entry into society and after coming in contact with Helen, she reads the text of Karma's utility and finally in her development by owning a vast plot
 Closed ends his lifeline
 ‘foust’ kaa vyakhyasahitya kaaphi vistrut he
 Goethe's sharp vision invented many elements that evolved over time to become conceivable
 uski kritiyon main vikaswad tathaa marxvad ke mul siddhant nihit hai or unamem us vichaardhaara ke liye bhi paryaapt samarthan miltaa he jisane hitler jaise nirankush shaskaon tathaa netaaon ko germany main lokapriy tathaa janata kii shraddha tathaa puja kaa paatr banaaya, yadhyapi unki samast shakti vidhwans kaary hi main barbaad hui
 The famous English poet Arnold called Goethe the 'physician of the Iron Age', but Goethe's ideas are still new and alive
 kalidas ke shakuntal ke liye usne prashansa ke jin shabdon kaa prayog kiya he vahi uski kritiyon ke liye bhi upyukt he-kyonki unamem bhi vasant kaa saurabh tathaa shishir kaa madhur ras purnroop se mishrit he

 dipastambh, dipaghar, yaa prakashastambh, samudratat par, dwipon par, chattaanon par, yaa nadiyon or jhiilon ke kinare pramukh sthanon par jahaajon ke maargdarshan ke liye banaae jate hai
 They emit light at night
 yah kisi bhi pranali se prakaash kiran prasaarit karti he
 In the olden times, these works were done by lighting a fire, because in the present time there are many other means of electricity
 iskaa uddeshy sagar main jahaajon ke chaalkon yaa navikon ko khatarnaak chattaanon se aagaah karnaa hota he
 These are meant to indicate the safe entry of rocky coastlines, dangerous reefs and harbors
 pehle kaaphi prayog hote rahe in prakaash deepon kaa prayog inke mahange anurakshan evam ji pi aar es takanic sahit anya unnat suvidhaon ke aane se bahut hi kam ho gaya he
 It is said that about 280 years ago, a lampstand of the confluence was built on the island of Pharos near Alexandria, which was 600 feet high
 yah vishwa ke saat aashcharyon main gina jaataa tha or itnaa prasiddh tha ki dipastambhon ke liye pashchim main faros ek saamaanya naam ho gaya tathaa dipastambh-nirmaan-vigyaan, farology kahalaane laga
 But in the 13th century it was destroyed by an earthquake
 is prakaar dipastambh kaa itihaas yadhyapi do hajaar varsh se bhi adhik pracheen he, phir bhi pranaraksha ke saath saadhan ke rup main dipastambhon kii niyamit vyavastha 19veen shatee main hi prarambh hui
 According to the circumstances and requirements of different places, the structure of lampstands is different
 bhoomi par, yaa bade tapuon par, bananevaale sthal dipastambhon kaa abhikalp praaia: ek jaisaa hi hota he
 The only difference is that according to Paras, that is, the height and the lighting equipment are kept as far as the light is required to be seen from each lamp
 kintu samudri dipastambh, jo khule samudr main padi kisi sunsaan chattan par banate hai jahaan din-raat bheeshan lehren takkar maaraa karti he, vastav main injiyiri kaushal ke vijayastambh hi hai
 The large lampstands of the United States of Alligator Reef, Great Britain's Eddystone, Belrock and Scarevore's France are extremely important in this regard
 samudri dipastambhon kii rachana ke chaar prakaar ullekhneey hai : 1
 Masonry or concrete structures are considered good for erecting rocks
 samudr ke andar peepe daalkar, yaa anyatra bhi jahaan pakki neenv rakhi ja sake, yah rachana upyukt hoti he
 In this type of composition, it takes special care that: 2
 khuli hui, ispaat yaa lohe kii dhaanchedaar rachana vahaan ke liye upyukt hoti he, jahaan kachi yaa balui jagah par sthunon yaa anya prakaar kii neenv aavashyak hoti he
 It is also suitable on hundreds of velas or coral reefs and in such places where other materials are expensive and the facility to create a composition is especially worth considering
 jameen main lohe yaa ispaat ke sthun gaad die jate yaa pench kii bhanti kas die jate hai or unke upar dhaanchaa khadaa kiya jaataa he
 3
 Cast iron iron tower is suitable where masonry pillar is very expensive due to high cost of stone and not enough labor
 4
 pipon kii neenv par khadi kii gai sanrachana saikat bela yaa retili mitti main hi safal ho sakati he
 a 140 feet high normal lamp made of granite, with a base diameter of 42 feet and a diameter of 16 feet above, has approximately 58,580 cubic feet of masonry
 prayek samudri dipaghar main praaia: chaar dipapal rahete hai, jinamein se teen dipaghar main hi rahete hai or chauthaa tat par
 Deeppal can also keep his family in Sthal Deepghars
 isliye inamen jab kuhara sanket hota he tab teen teen, anyathaa do-do hi, dipapal rahete hai
 Countries such as Great Britain, France and the United Nations, USA, have a large number of lighthouses on the Ta beach and have special government institutions for their arrangement, but the sea level in India has not yet attained the same importance
 yahan ke keval do dipastambh ullekhneey hai : ek bengal kii khadi main alaguada chattan par, jo san 1865 main bana tha or doosraa bombai ke paas, jo san 1874 main bana
 In the peak of the ancient lampstands, lighting was often done by burning coal or wooden logs on top of a mesh
 vah vyavastha bahut mahangi padati thi
 Some times 400 tons of coal were used in a year, yet the constant change of light and constant appearance of light in the atmosphere was always uncertain
 aisi prakashvyavastha praaia: 19veen shatee ke madhya tak rahi, yadhyapi 18veen shatee main tel kaa prayog bhi hone laga tha
 Coalgas was used in the 19th century
 san 1898 main francisi dipadhar seva ne uddipt khanij teljvalak lagaae
 Nowadays, these are often seen all over the world
 inamen sthaan-sthaan par maamuli bhed hota he
 The principle of incandescent mineral oil flammers is that the liquid mineral oil is injected with pressure into a vaporizer, where it is heated to vapor by a few secondary jets
 vaashp ek tonti se nikalataa he or apane saath kuch vaayu liye hue jwalak ke sheersh par bane ek prakoshth main pahunchataa he, jahaan donon milakar dahansheel gas main badal jate hai, jisase mantal uddipt hota he
 Also, a little gas also reaches the secondary jets
 ek haathpump dwaara sampeedit vaayu kii kuch maatra sthir rakhi jaati he, jisase ant:kshepan ke liye dabaav uplabdh rahe
 The use of oil gas started in the eighth decade of the last century
 tel gas bade bade pipon main, jinhen samay samay par prakashastambhon main pahunchaana padataa he, vayumandal ke nau-das gune dabaav par bhari rahati he
 The flame of acetylene itself has a lot of glow and the transportation of this gas is convenient
 isliye boyon tathaa sanketon main prakaash ke liye to yah sansar bhar main kaam aati hi he, amahatvapurn prakashastambhon ke liye or aise sthanon par bhi jahaan parichar nahin rahete, iskaa prayog hota he
 Mantilwala zalwak is also sometimes applied to enhance the brightness
 kuch uddipt jvalkon se aisi hi dipti nikalati he jaisi khanij tel-vaashp-jvalkon se
 Some lighthouse officers also use on-the-spot gas-making plants from carbide and water
 prakaash ke liye kahin-kahin bijli kaa bhi prayog kiya gaya he
 Lanterns - Except for very small pillars, almost all lighthouses have lighting devices placed inside a lantern at the top
 laalaten ke shishon ke gaj kaaphi majboot, kintu yathasambhav patale hote he, taaki prakaash nikalne main unke kaaran kam se kam avrodh ho
 The upper part of the lantern is like a dome, with a ventilator to vent the heat
 paryaapt sanvathan bahut aavashyak he
 The size of a lantern varies according to the lighting device placed in it
 chote stambhon main iskaa vyas paanch foot tak ho saktaa he, jab ki pratham shrenee ke stambhon main praaia: 14 foot or dwitiya shrenee ke stambhon main 12 foot hota he
 The glazed portion of the large lanterns is about 10 feet high
 sheesha praaia: 1 / 4 inch motaa or laalaten kii golai ke anuroop hi muda hota he
 Where there is a high fear of breakage, a 12-inch thick mirror is applied
 laalaten kii chat praaia: lohe kii, yaa taanbe kii, hoti he
 These sheets are kept in a structure with steel, gunmetal or cast iron links
 kuch prakashastambhon main yah bhi aavashyak prathit hua he ki baahar kii ore jaali yaa janglaa laga diya jaae, taaki prakaash se aakrisht hokar samudri pakshi chot se sheesha hi na tod den
 The barrels of the lantern, the handcuffs and the major metallic composition should be attached to the tadtsinvak
 taditsanvahak 1 / 4 inch moti taanbe kii chad kaa tathaa sanvatak ke ucchtam bhaag se 18 inch upar tak hona chahie
 Its lower end should go from the lowest of the water to the bottom, or it should be buried in wet soil by putting a 20 inch long, 12 inch wide and 1 / 2 inch thick crust on the end
 prakaash upkaran - 19veen shatee ke antim paad main sthirdip ke avagun vishesh rup se anubhav kiye gaye
 Their use was gradually reduced and in place of them, the need for special kind of light was deemed favorable to the situation
 bhramideep, jisamen samay-samay par prachhaadan hota rahe, adhik upyukt samajha gaya
 Sometimes there is a drum-like curtain around the flame, which can be elevated or lowered
 kabhi-kabhi ghumta hua prachhadanpat lagaaya jaataa he
 To keep the cover moving, there is a device such as a load or spring-operated clock, which carries a warning signal along with a moving regulator, which in time suggests that the key needs to be given now
 jahaan bijli uplabdh hoti he, ek choti si motor bhi laga di jaati he, jo aavashyaktaa hone par swat: chaabi de diya karti he, athwa sidhe prakaash upkaran ko hi ghumaati rahati he
 In modern instruments illuminated by gas, the pressure of gas is used to rotate the lens of the device
 yadi kisi prakaar ke gas jwalak lage hai, to kabhi kabhi unhen hi baari baari se jala bujhaakar prakaash or prachhaadan kaa prabhaav utpann kiya jaataa he
 Modern light glow is better than masking light
 bhanti bhanti ke prakaash jo aajkal kaam aate hai, nimnlikhit hai : Jyoti appears continuously in the same way in Staddeep
 iskaa prayog ab keval chote pattanon tak hi simit rah gaya he tathaa aadhunik prakashastambhon main nahin ke baraabar he
 This can cause illusions of shiplight, or adjacent coastal light
 damak jyoti anek prakaar kii hoti he
 a spark-light appears at important places
 damakane ke bich kaa antaraal damakane ke samay se sadaa adhik hota he
 In a multiple-fire-light, there is a sequence of long intervals after flaring two or more times: such as two, three, or more, half-second seconds, half-second flashes of two seconds, then dark for ten seconds The sequence of moves continuously
 sthir-damak-jyoti main sthir jyoti ke bich bich niyamit antar se ek damak aati he, jiske aage peeche thodi thodi der kaa prachhaadan rahata he
 It becomes unreliable when the light intensity is uneven
 sthir evam anek-damak-jyoti main bhi yahi dosha he
 In the masking light, there is a sequence of coverings at regular intervals with steady light
 prakaash or tam kaa samay samaan yaa asmaan ho saktaa he
 When the cover is of two, or more times, it is called multiple covert-light
 prayavarti prakaash baari baari se do rangon ke sthir prakaash ko kehete hai
 If any of the aforesaid light turns alternately into two colors, then applying the first reversal of its name makes sense
 sandarshan prakaash kisi sankare maarg main sandarshan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Bhramideep is not used for this
 sthirdip hi, praaia: prachhaadan sahit, is kaam ke liye upyukt hote hai
 In a particular waterway, or between sandy shores or other dangerous places, there is such a system of lighting to show the way that the danger should be colored with white light and white light should keep a sufficient distance from the danger and provide safe passage
 rangeen prakaash kaa prayog kahi kahin khatarnaak jagahon kii pahchaan ke liye, yaa anek prakaar ke sanketon main bhinnata laane ke liye, anivaary ho jaataa he, anyathaa rangon kaa prayog yathasambhav kam se kam kiya jaataa he
 Because it reduces the intensity of light
 pahchaan kaa kaam anek-damak-jyoti se hi chalaanaa acha he
 Light from alternating colors cannot also be recommended, because absorption of colored rays and colorless rays in the atmosphere is different
 yadi anivaary hi hota he, to rangeen kiranavali ke liye lens or prism-samooh kaa kshetra bada kar diya jaataa he, taaki aarambh main inaki tivrata rangahin kirnwali kii tivrata ke lagbhag baraabar hi rahe
 After penetrating the red color of the glass, the intensity of light remains only 40 percent and on penetrating the green color only 25 per cent
 isliye yadi rangahin prakaash ke saath saath laal or hare rang ke prakaash bhi rakhana anivaary hon, to unhen prabalit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The intensity is increased to the required level by applying mirrors or by prismal azimuthal condensation, or any other way
 paraas, arthath kitni dur se prakashastambh dikhaai de saktaa he, yah do baton par nirbhar he : ek to samudratal se oonchaai or duusare, prakaash kii tivrata
 The light of most of the important lampstands is so intense that it can be seen with full geographical range in clear weather
 paraas samudri milon main nikaala jaataa he or darshak kii sthiti samudratal se praaia: 15 foot unchi maan lee jaati he
 In certain conditions of the atmosphere, the glow of special powerful light can be seen even beyond the calculated range

 barbari kii kuch sangyaaon par 'saamaanya vidhi' lagu hoti he jisamen shabd kaa pehla swar badal kar uske ant main 'na' laga diya jaataa he - The broken method is applied to some nouns in which only the vowels of a singular word are altered to make the plural - teesraa tareeqa mishrit vidhi hoti he, jo pehali do vidhiyon kaa mishran he - To make the feminine of a noun, 't' is placed around its masculine form in the singular and in the plural only 'ta' is applied to its beginning - dhyaan den ki "taimazimut", "tifinag" or kai anya barbari shabdon main prayog hone vaale varna 'ga' kaa uccharan "ga" se bhinn he
 It is like the 'gha' of 'ghazal'
 isi tarah 'kh' kaa uccharan bhi 'kha' se bhinn he

 The range of temperature studied in cryogenics is quite high
 kuch vaigyanikon ke anusaar isamen -180° fahrenheit se neeche ke taapmaana par hi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 This temperature is well below the refrigeration point of water and when metals are brought up to this temperature, surprising effects are seen on them

 In such rocket engines, extremely cold and liquefied gases are used as fuel and oxidizer
 is ingine main hydrogen or eendhan kramash: eendhan or oxikaarak kaa kaary karte hai
 They prove to be many times more powerful than solid fuels and give a boost to rockets

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true then it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics
 in falon se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kii kasuti kaa kaam le sakate hai
 These three fruits are as follows: coma berenisis khagoleey gole ke uttari bhaag main sthit ek taramandal he jo 88 aadhunik taramandalon main se ek he
