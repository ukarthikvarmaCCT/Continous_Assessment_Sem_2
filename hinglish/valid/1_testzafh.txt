citric amla main 3 carboxylic mulak upasthit rahata he atah ise tri carboxylic cycle yaa tisie chakra bhi kehete hai
 In the cyclic reactions of the Krebs cycle, complete oxidation of pyruvic acid gives out one molecule of carbon dioxide at three places throughout the cycle, that is, three carbon atoms of pyruvic acid leave three molecules as carbon dioxide
 shwasan kriya ke creb chakra ke dauraan pyruvik amla oxeloacetic amla se kriya karata he
 It consists of three co-enzymes
 sarvapratham piruvik amla injim kii upasthiti main oxykrut hokar carbon dioxide tathaa hydrogen main badal jaataa he
 The hydrogen dioxide receptor combines with NAD to form NADH 2 and the carbon dioxide gas is released into the atmosphere
 enediech tu main upasthit hydrogen kai shwasan injimon kii usthiti main oxygen se milakar jal main badal jaataa he tathaa urja mukt hoti he
 This energy is combined with ADP and stored as ATP
 ek anu glucose ke purna rup se oxikaran ke falswaroop 38 anu atipi kaa nirmaan hota he
 ATP is a repository of energy, also called energy currency
 atipi main sanchit urja jeevon ke aavashyaktaanusaar vighatit hokar urja mukt hoti he jisamen jeevon kii vibhinn jaivik kriyaayein sanchalit hoti he
 Oxidative respiration does not require oxygen and it occurs in the absence of oxygen
 is kriya main bhojan kaa apurna oxikaran hota he
 Carbon dioxide and lactic acid are formed as a result of this action in animals and in plants carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol are formed and a very small amount of energy is released
 is prakaar kaa shwasan kuch nimna shrenee ke paudhon, yeast, jeevanu, evam antah paraseete jantuon jaise golkrimi, feetakrimi, monocystis ityadi main hota he
 Under certain circumstances, high-grade animals, plant tissues, seeds, juicy fruits, etc
 also occur in the absence of oxygen
 manushyon yaa ucch shrenee ke jeevon kii mansapeshiyon ke thakne kii avasthaa main yah shwasan hota he
 The organisms that have this respiration are called Nairobes
 oxic shwasan ke samaan hi anaksi shwasan ke prarambh main glicolisis kii kriya hoti he jiske ant main piruvik amla banataa he
 In the further process, there is no complete oxidation of pyruvic acid due to lack of oxygen, so this respiration produces much less energy than oxygen respiration
 paudhon main yah piruvik amla carboxillej injim kii upasthiti main acitaldihide or carbon daai oxide main badal jaati he
 This is then degraded by NADH2 in the presence of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, and is converted to NAD and ethyl alcohol
 praaniyon kii peshiyon tathaa kuch jeevanuon main oxygen kii anupasthiti main glicolisi ke ant main nirmit piruvik amla NADH2 kii sahaayta se lactic amla main badal jaataa he
 Fermentation is a specific chemical action of anoxic respiration
 isamen sookshm jeevon tathaa injimon kii upasthiti main jatil carbonic yogicon kaa vighatan saral yogicon ke rup main hota he
 Fermentation occurs in yeast, lactobacillus and sprouted seeds
 kinvan kii kriya ko mukhyatah do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he- alcoholic kinvan tathaa amleey kinnav
 In the process of alcoholic fermentation, glucose is dissolved in ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide and some energy is released
 yah east tathaa ankurit beej aadi main hoti he
 gimase is an enzyme produced by Ist
 amleey kinvan jeevanu evam mansapeshiyon main hoti he
 Acids are formed in it
 iskaa aarthik mahatva bhi he
 With its help, alcohol, vinegar, curd etc
 are produced and chemical materials are produced in the craft industry
 shwasan kii kriya main carbon daai-oxide kaa vah aaytan jo baahar nikalataa he tathaa jitna aaytan oxigen kaa avasorana hota he uske anupaat ko shwasan bhagfal kehete hai
 It is always represented in numbers such as - 6CO2 / 6O2 = 1 Respiratory quotient indicates which type of food is being oxidized in respiration, as this ratio is different in different foods
 shwasan kii kriya main upyog main aane vaale khadyapadaarthon ke aadhaar par iskaa maan ikai, ikai se kam, ikai se adhik hota he
 When the food substance that is oxidized to respiration is carbohydrate, then the value of the respiratory quotient is unit, such as in seeds of germinated wheat
 jab shwasan main upyog hone vaala khadyapadaarth vasa yaa protein ho tab shwasan bhagfal kaa maan ikai se kam hota he
 2C51H98O6 + 145O2 → 102CO2 + 98H2O + Energy shwasan main upyog aane vaala khadyapadaarth jab protein hota he tab shwasan-gunank kaa maan 0
4 se 0
9 tak ho saktaa he
 If we know the value of RQ, then we can guess what kind of food is being reacted in respiration
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya main paudhe prakaash kii upasthiti main vaataavaran se carbon daai-oxide ko grahan karte hai tathaa oxigen gas vaataavaran main mukt karte hai
 It is natural to increase the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere and decrease of carbon dioxide, but in reality it is not so
 shwasan kii kriya main sajiv din or raat har samay oxigen gas grahan karte hai tathaa carbon daai-oxide gas kaa vaataavaran main tyaag karte hai
 In this way, the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases in the atmosphere is maintained by respiration
 shwasan ek urja-unmochan prakriya he
 In respiration, food is oxidized, releasing the accumulated energy
 shwasan ke samay mukt urja kaa kuch bhaag koshika ke mitocondria main atipi ke rup main sanchit ho jaati he
 This energy, accumulated in the form of ATP, is used to carry out various biological functions of living organisms in future
 mukt honi vaali ooshmiya urja sajivon ke sharir ke tapakram ko santulit banaae rakhane main sahaayta karti he
 Light is produced from the bodies of some insects and sea animals
 yah prakaash shwasan dwaara utpann urja kaa hi ek roopaantarit rup he
 The body of some marine organisms such as electric ray fish and torpedoes, etc
 generates electric waves for self-defense, it is produced by the conversion of energy generated by electric respiration
 prakaash-sanshleshan evam shwasan kii kriyaayein ek duusare kii poorak evam vipareet hoti hai
 In photosynthesis, the chemical reaction between carbon d-oxide and water results in the formation of glucose and release of oxygen
 shwasan main iske vipareet glucose ke oxikaran ke falswaroop jal tathaa carbon daai-oxide banati hai
 Photosynthesis is a creative activity that results in an increase in the dry weight of living organisms
 shwasan ek nasaatmak kriya he, is kriya ke falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main kami aati he
 Food is produced by the use of solar energy in photosynthesis, radiation energy is converted into chemical energy
 jabaki shwasan main bhojan ke oxikaran se urja mukt hoti he, bhojan main sanchit rasinic urja kaa prayog sajiv apane vibhinn kaaryon main karata he
 Thus, these two activities complement each other by relying on each other's end products for their raw materials
 sajivon ke sharir main prayek koshika main jaev-rasinic kriyaayein hoti rahati hai
 Daily energy is required to perform these actions
 urja kaa mukhya strot bhojan he
 Solar energy is stored as potential energy in food
 shwasan kriya main shwasan kaa mukhya padaarth glucose kaa oxigen kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti main purna yaa apurna oxikaran hota he, jiske falswaroop bhojan main sanchit sthitij urja gatij urja ke rup main mukt hota he, jisase jivan kii dainik kriyaaon ke sampaadan hetu aavashyak urja kaa unmochan tathaa purti hoti he
 The glucose required for oxidation in respiration is produced between nutrition
 poshan ke liye aavashyak urja, shwasan kriya main utpann urja se praapt hoti he
 In this way, respiration and nutrition are inextricably related to each other
 koshikeey shwasan ke dwaara atipi nirmaan ke liye adhikansh sajiv shwasan kii vaatapekshi vidhi par nirbhar hai parantu kram-vikaas ke dauraan pehle vatanirpekshi shwasan kaa vikaas hua tha

 chunki vaataavaran main swatantra oxygen nahin tha isliye in sajivon main shwasan kii vatanirpekshi prakriya kaa vikaas hua jiske liye oxygen kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati he
 After this, these prokaryotes ruled the earth for about 1 billion years
 inamen apana bhojan swayan banane ke liye prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya hoti thi
 In the process of photosynthesis, carbohydrates are formed with the help of carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and oxygen gas is released
 is mukt hue oxygen kaa pariman dhire-dhire vaataavaran main badhane laga
 In the presence of oxygen, a new method of respiration developed in living cells that could produce more ATP
 is vidhi ke dwaara koshikaaye pehle se adhik urja utpann karne lageen
 This led to their increasing size and the evolution of complex eukaryotic organisms from simple prokaryotes
 inhen eukariotic jeevon se vartmaan samay ke shaiwal, kavak, padap evam jantuon kaa vikaas hua he jinamein koshikeey shwasan atyant viksit he
 If bio-evolution of cellular respiration had not happened, perhaps even today, ancient prokaryotic organisms would have ruled the earth

 Pali literature mainly contains a collection of teachings of Lord Buddha, the founder of Buddhism
 kintu iskaa koi bhaag buddha ke jeevankaal main vyavasthit yaa likhit rup dhaaran kar chukaa tha, yah kahana kathin he
 Although there are some such references in Tripitaka itself, which shows the systematic reading of some episodes of religion during the lifetime of Buddha
 udaahranarth, udaan main varnan he ki ek baar seen naamak bhikshu se swayan bhagwaan ne poocha ki tumne dharm ko kaise samajha? iske uttar main us bhikshu ne 16 ashtak virgon ko puure swar ke saath gaakar suna diya
 God also praised it

 Based on this tradition, there are three references to musicals in the Chullavagga, Deepavansh, Mahavansh etc
 texts to give the Buddha's teachings a systematic literary form
 pratham sangeeti buddhanirvana ke chaar maas pashchaat hi rajgrih main hui jinamein 500 bhikshuon ne bhaag liya, jiske karan vah panchashatika naam se bhi prasiddh he
 It was presided over by Mahakashyapa and he collected the above topics with the approval of other monks, by asking questions related to the Vinaya and Suttha with Sthya Anand from the monk Upali, the disciple of Buddha
 isi prakaar kii duusari sangeeti buddha nirvana ke 100 varsh pashchaat vaishali main hui jisamen 700 bhikshu sammilit hue or isiilie vah saptshatika ke naam se vikhyath hui
 In this, by showing many faults in the conduct of the monks of Vaishali, they were held against Vinay and presumably special arrangements were brought in Vinayapitaka

 This composition was also included in the Abhidhammapitaka
 is sangeeti kaa ullekh chullavagg main nahin he or na tibeti yaa chini mahayan sampradaay ke sahitya main
 There is no mention of any such music in Ashoka's Bhabru article, which also mentions the names of seven episodes, or in other scriptures
 is kaaran isaki aitihaasikta main kith, vailaser aadi vidwaanon ko andeh he

 As a result of these music and other efforts, the form of Pali Tripitaka obtained and the form which is available to us today, is as follows: mul pali sahitya teen bhaagon main vibhakt he, jinhen pitak kaha gaya he - "vinayapitak", "suttapitak" or "abhidhammpitak"
 Each of these Pitakas consists of many small and large compositions related to their respective subjects

 Here, there is no attempt to summarize the object
 uddeshy he nai-nai baton ko saamaanya shrotaaon ke grahan yogya bananaa or isiilie yahan upadesh ke mukhya bhaag kii baar-baar punrariti kii gai he
 Incidentally, these Sutts have also depicted the religious, social and political conditions of the time, which is very important from the point of view of ancient history
 udaahranarth, digh nikaay ke samanayfal sutt, brahmajaal sutt evam mahaparinibban sutt main buddha ke samasamyik dharmpravartakon jaise mankhaligosaal, pakudhakachchayan, ajit cese kambali, sanjay baltthiputt niganthnatputt, aadi ke aachaar-vichaaron tathaa unke dwaara pravartit dharm sampradaayon kii buddha drushti se aalochana pai jaati he or saath hi un-un vishyon par buddha manyata kaa pratipaadan bhi paaya jaataa he
 The social depiction is scattered in the Sutpitaka, although its contents are available to the Jatakas under the Kudak body
 sutton main sthaan-sthaan par buddhakalin magadh, videh, koshal, kaashi aadi 16 janapadon ke raajaaon unke paraspar sambandhon evam ladaai-jhagadon or daanv-penchon ke ullekh bhare pade hai
 The Buddhist ethos in which the signs of Buddhism are found in the sermons of sutas have also been arranged in the Vinaya Pitaka, from the law-prohibition-system as the rules of virtue worthy of the monks
 isi prakaar sutton main jis tatvachintan ke beej sannihit hai, unka darshanik shabdaawalee main saidhantik rup se pratipaadan or vivechan abhidhamm pitak main kiya gaya he
 Because of this interrelatedness, Buddhism cannot have complete sangopang and systematic understanding without Tripitaka's observation
 yah pali tripitak vishay kii drushti se swayan buddha bhagwaan ke upadeshon par aadhaarit he
 From the point of view of the available text, from the third century BCE onwards, it is not proved
 buddha paramparanusaar ashok samrat ke kaal main hi unke putr mahendra swayan buddha bhikshu banakar is sahitya ko lanka le gaye or vahaan pratham shatee i
 main raja battagamani ke rajyakaal main use vah likhit rup praapt hua jisamen vah aaj hamen miltaa he
 However, we do not find any such thing which can be visited in the period of two to three centuries due to the influence of the circumstances of Lanka
 apane namaanusaar vinayapitak kaa vishay bhikshuon ke paalane yogya sadachaar ke niyam upasthit karnaa he
 It has three different divisions - Suttavibhang, Khandhak and Parivar
 suttavibhang ke pun: do upavibhag hai - mahavagg or chullavagg
 Thus, compared to these subdivisions, the Vinayapitaka is divided into five parts
 suttapitak apane vishay, vistaar tathaa rachana kii drushti se tripitak kaa sabase mahatvapurn bhaag he
 It contains a collection of Sutras which according to tradition are either stated by Lord Buddha himself or are assigned by his disciple and approved by Lord Buddha himself
 sutt kaa sanskrit roopaantar sutara kiya jaataa he
 But the formulas presented in the Sutras are not visible in the formulas that are found in the ancient formulas of Sanskrit, such as the Srauta Sutras of Vedic literature, Grihama and Dharmasutra etc
 sutara kaa vishesh lakshan he ati sankshep main kam se kam shabdon main adhik se adhik arth vyakt karnaa
 There is a complete lack of repetition in it
 kintu yahan sankshipt style ke vipareet suvistrut vyaakhyaan tathaa mukhya baton kii baar-baar punrariti kii style apanaai gai he
 For this reason the Sutra version of Sutta does not seem appropriate
 vichaar karne se anumaan hota he ki sutt kaa abhipraay mulat: sookt se rahaa he
 Each episode of the Vedas has also been called Sukta
 kisi ek baat ke pratipaadan ko sookt kahana sarvatha uchit prathit hota he
 There are five parts of suttapitaka called bodies - Dighnikaya, Majjhimnikaya, samyuktanikaya, Angusadnikaya and Khudkadnikaya
 dirghanikaay teen virgon main vibhajit he
 The first sealakhandhavagga has 13 suttas, the second Mahavagga has 10 and the third patikavagga has 11
 is prakaar dirghanikaay main 34 sutt hai
 This Sutta is longer in detail than the Sutras stored in other bodies and this is the meaning of the name of this body
 majjhimanikaay main madhyamvistaar ke 152 sutt he jo 15 virgon main vibhakt hai - Of these, there are 12 suttas in the 14th class Vibhang and ten each in the rest
 sanyuttanikaay main chote bade sabhi prakaar ke sutton kaa sangrah he or yahi is nikaay ke naam kii sarthakata he
 There are a total of 56 suttas or samyutas divided into these five classes - angutar nikaay kii apni ek visheshta he
 In this, the collection of Sutras is done according to an arrangement
 aadi main aise sutt hai jinamein buddha bhagwaan ke ek sankhyatmak padaartho vishyak upadeshon kaa sangrah he, tatpashchaat do padaarthon vishyak sutton kaa or phir teen, chaar aadi
 In the same order within this body is a compilation of eleven niches of these names Ekknipat, Dukanipat & Tik, Chatuvak, Panchak, Chhak, Sattak, Atthak, Navak, Dasak and Ekadasak
 ye nipaat pun: virgon main vibhajit hai, jinaki sankhya nipaat kram se 21, 16, 16, 26, 12, 9, 9, 9, 22 or 3 he
 Thus, the total number of classes in 11 nipatas is 169
 prayek varg ke bheetar anek sutt hai jinaki sankhya ek varg main kam se kam 7 or adhik se adhik 262 he
 Thus, the number of sutas from Angusvada Nikaya is 2308
 khuddak nikaay main vishay tathaa rachana kii drushti se praaia: sarvatha swatantra 15 rachanaaon kaa samavesh he, jinke naam hai - The third part of the Pali Tripitaka, Abhidhammapitaka, analyzes and classifies the visual thoughts of Lord Buddha and presents lists and definitions from the point of view of nature
 is pitak main nimna saat granthon kaa samavesh he- Dhamamsani is divided into two parts according to her mother
 pratham bhaag main 22 tik hai jinamein se prayek main teen teen vishyon kaa vivechan kiya gaya hai
 There are 100 shops in the second department and each shop has a law and prohibition of two subjects
 ye duk 12 virgon main vibhajit hai jinke naam hai - Thus the number of dhikamsani's tikas and dukes is 122
 inamen se pratham tik kushal, akushal tathaa avyaakrit dharmavishyak he, jo sabase mahatvapurn he or uske vishay kaa prarupan chittupapad rup nikkshep or atthuddhar in chaar candon main kiya gaya he
 The theme of Vibhang is divided into 18 departments
 kathavatthu main 23 adhyyon ke bheetar 216 prashnottar hai jinamein virdohi sampradaayon ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 There are 10 chapters in Puggalpannatti, in which, in the increasing order of one type, two type, etc
, in the tenth chapter, 10, 10 types of Pudgals, ie individuals, have been instructed
 vyaktiyon kaa vibhaajan pruthgjan, samyak sambuddha, prayek buddha, shaikshya, ashaikshya, arya, anarya aadi rup se kiya gaya he
 The basis of the composition of the metal story is different, because the first three, namely, the wing, volume and metal fractures of the same, have been discussed more closely here
 isi kaaran is granth kaa doosraa naam khamb-aaytan-dhatukatha bhi paaya jaataa he
 The relationship of these three is mentioned in the book by sitting with religions
 matikanusaar in dharmon kii sankhya 125 he jo is prakaar hai - These are interlinked in 14 chapters in the style of Q&A
 yamak main dharmon kaa sambandh vishesh vishyon ke saath paraspar vipareet rup main prashnottar style se samajhaayaa gaya he or isi yugal prashnaatmak reeti ke kaaran is rachana kaa yamak naam sarthak he
 Like are all skilled religions efficient? Are all Kushamul Kushal religions? And so on
 isi paddati se yamak main abhidhammpitak main prayukt paribhaashik shabdon kii sunishchit vyakhya dene kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 This composition is divided into these 10 punks - patthan main buddha tatvachintan ke aadharbhoot pratithya-samutpaada-siddhant kaa ek vishesh style main bade vistaarpurvak vivechan kiya gaya he
 The main four parts of the book are - in chaaron bhaagon main dhammsangani main nirdisht 22 tikon or 100 dukon kaa 24 pratyayon se sambandh nimna chah patthanon dwaara samajhaayaa gaya he : tik pan duk pan duk-tik pan tik-duk pan tik-dik pan or duk-duk pa
 With the preservation of these six articles in the previous four departments, the entire book is divided into 24 pieces
 uparyukt tripitak sahitya kaa sankalan praaia: i
pus
 teesri shatee main purna ho gaya tha, kintu pali sahitya kaa srijan iske pashchaat bhi chalata rahaa
 Although, in terms of the subject of relevant literature, it usually imitates the knowledge completely under Tripitaka, yet in its form and style, development is seen in it according to the pace of time
 i
pus
 pratham shatee ke lagbhag nettprikaran naamak granth likhaa gaya jisamen abhidhammpitak ke vishay kaa hi kuch adhik sookshmata se vivechan kiya gaya he
 It has attempted to explain the definitions of Buddhist philosophy through 16 necklaces, 5 new and 18 original verses
 iske karta kaa naam kacchan he
 a similar composition is the Petkopadesh of about this period, in which the theme of Netification is presented in some other way, in which the four Aryan truths are the mainstay which are the foundation of Buddha's teachings
 praaia: isi kaal kii teesri rachana he - milind-panhon jo pali sahitya main apni visheshta rakhti he va aitihaasik drushti se bhi badi mahatvapurn he
 It describes a conversation between the King of Sakal, Milind and the monk Nagsen
 milind us yavan naresh minadar ke naam kaa hi roopaantar mana gaya he jisane i
 pus
 dwitiya shatee ke madhya main bharat par akraman kiya tathaa punjab pradesh main apana rajya jamaaya tha
 According to the text presented, this king was very scholarly and interested in philosophical subjects
 usne bhikshu nagsen se bade paine darshanik prashn kiye, jiske uttar bhi nagsen ne badi chaturaai se sundar drushtaanton dwaara unki pushti karte hue die hai
 There are seven chapters in the book - inamen se pratham teen adhyay hi granth kaa mul bhaag mana jaataa he
 The remaining four chapters appear to be added backwards
 iske anek kaaran hai- ek to tisare adhyay main granth ke pun: prarambh kii soochna he; duusare, buddhaghosh ke avataran praaia: teen hi adhyyon se liye gaye hai or tisare is granth kaa jo chini anuwaad 400 i
 ke lagbhag kiya gaya tha, usamen keval ye teen hi adhyay paae jate hai
 This composition is very interesting in style and unique in its style for the knowledge of Buddhist doctrine
 in rachanaaon ke pashchaat atthakathaon kaa yug prarambh hota he
 According to the Shrut tradition, when Maali and Sanghamitra reached Pali Tripitaka Lanka and Buddhism flourished, those original texts were written in the Sinhalese language
 ye atthakathaayen ab uplabdh nahin he
 Presumably, the reason for the creation of those books is to miss the teaching of those original books
 in nai pali atthakathaon ke karta acharya buddhaghosh kaa naam pali sahitya main bahut prasiddh he
 Among the Sinhalese chronicles he has mentioned and whose incarnations he has taken in his fables, the main ones are- antim chaar atthakathaayen nikaayon athwa unke kinhin vishyon ke vishesh vyaakhyaan ke rup main prathit hote hai
 In the absence of these original chronicles, it is difficult to say to what extent Buddhaghosha imitated them and how radically they did, however it seems clear from looking at his compositions that he has given the original choreography by his vast knowledge of Tripitaka
 Must have flourished
 unki atthakathaayen vinayapitak, suttapitak evam abhidhammpitak ke adhikansh bhaagon par milti hai, jinaki sankhya 16 he
 Apart from these eight stories, there is a specific composition of Buddhaghosha, Visuddhimagga, which can be called the enlightenment of Buddhist philosophy
 atthakathaon main swayan buddhaghosh ke kathananusaar unhone visuddhimagg main digh, majjhim, sanyutt or angutar in chaaron nikaayon kaa saar bhar diya he
 According to the dictated tradition, he had written Visuddhimagga to prove his mettle before his works
 is granth main kul 23 pariched hai
 The subject of the first two passages is "samadhi" and the remaining verses discuss "pragya"
 buddhaghosh ke pashchaat atthakathaon kii parampara ko unke praaia: samasamyik do aacharyon buddhadutt or dhammpal ne paripusht kiya
 Buddhadatta summarized Vinayapitaka's story titled Samudhapasadika, Buddhaghosha, in his post-scripture and Vinayavinchashya, and composed a prose-verse-compound text called Abhidhammavatara based on Buddhaghosa's Abhidhamma choreography
 isamen moulikta yah he ki jahaan buddhaghosh ne rup, vednadi paanch skandhon ke dwaara dharmon kaa vivechan kiya he, vahaan buddhadutt ne chittar, chetsik, rup or nirvana is chaar prakaar ke vargeekaran ko apanaaya he
 He has kept this classification in his composition named as Vibhag
 buddhadutt kii ek or rachana he madhuratth vilasini, jo buddhawans kii atthkatha he
 Dhammapala has written seven books
 khuddakanikaay ke antargat jin udaan, itishuttak, vimaanavtthu, petavatthu, thergatha, therigatha ev chariapitak naamak granthon par buddhaghosh ne atthakathaayen nahin likhin, unpar dhammpal ne paramatthdipani naamak atthkatha likhi he
 Likewise wrote the commentary called Atathasvanna on Nettikaran and the commentary called Leenatthvannana on the same, Paramatthamunjusha on Visuddhimagga, Lekanthapakasini on the fables of the four bodies of Buddhaghosha, the commentary on the Jatakattakatha and the commentary of Buddhaattatta
 in sab rachanaaon main sabase adhik prasiddh he unki visuddhimagg kii tikaa
 There is no distinction in the remaining compositions
 yadhyapi ukt tripitak va unki atthakathaon kii rachana ke pashchaat nahin he
 Although after the creation of the said Tripitaka and his stories, there is not much to be said in relation to the Buddhist text, yet the creation of the commentary literature called this Attakatha continued to be on par with the Buddhaghosha era
 inamen se kuch rachanaayen is prakaar hai : Anandkrit Abhidhamma original vaccine, Chulldmmpal integrated 'true essence', Upasen integrated Sddhmmppjotik Mahanam integrated Sdsmmppakasini, Kssp integrated Mahvichcedni and Vimtichcedni, Vjrabuddhi integrated Snmtwpasadika vaccine, well-being integrated Kemppakrn, Aniruddha integrated Abhidmmtthsngho Prmtthviniscy and Namrupprichced, Dharmsri integrated Khuddksickha and Mahaswamji integrated Mulsickha
 12veen shatee se atthakathaon par magadhi bhashaa main hi tikaaon kii rachana prarambh hui
 To facilitate this work, a musical work was done by the Sinhalese stabilizer Mahakassap during the reign of Lanka King Parakramabahu I, which resulted in eight commentaries written on the Samantapasadika etc
 stories, namely Dipani, Manjusa, Pacasini etc
 Only the written Sarathdipani vaccine is available
 iske karta sariputt kii teen anya tikaayen bhi milti hai- Sumangal, Saddhammjotipal, Dhammakirti, Budharvikhat and Meghankar - all of them have written commentaries on different fables
 inamen akele vaachissar ther ke mul sikha tikaa aadi das tikaa granth milte hai
 In the 13th century many texts like Samantakootavannana were composed by Sthavira Videha, Budhapriya and Dharmakirti
 14veen shatee kii rachanaaon main chaar kavy granth prasiddh hai- The names of the authors of the latter three compositions are unknown
 14veen shatee ke pashchaat pali-sahitya-srijan kaa kshetra lanka se uthakar brahmadesh main pahunch gaya
 The litterateurs here made Abhidhamma particularly the subject of study
 15veen shatee kii kuch rachanaayen hai- In the 16th century, Saddhammalankar wrote a commentary on the case of Patahana called Patahandeepani and wrote an epilogue called Madhusaraya Deepani on the Abhidhamma-moola-tika enjoyed by Mahanama
 17veen shatee main tripitakalankar ne atthasalini par kii bees gaathaon main visativannana, sariputtakrut vinayasangrah par vinayalankar naamak tikaa tathaa yasavadjnavatthu in teen granthon kii rachana kii

 The three compositions of the Sangharaj of Brahmadesa, the ninth century of Gyanamivanshnam, are famous- 19veen shatee kii brahmadesh kii kuch rachanaayen hai- nalatadhatu vans, sandes katha simavivadvinishchay aadi
 The works of this century named Chhakeshadhatuvans, Gandhavans and Sasanavans have been introduced under Vans literature
 is shatee kii anya ullekhneey rachana he bhikshu ledisdaav krit abhidhammsangrah kii parpatthadipani tikaa tathaa yamak sambandhi pali niabandh jo unhone shrimati rice davidz kii kuch shankaaon ke samaadhaan ke liye likhaa tha
 It would not be inappropriate to mention two works of the 20th century as evidenced by the uninterrupted stream of Pali literature
 ye hai bharatvarsh main bhandat dharmanand kosambi dwaara rachit visuddhimaggadipika or abhidhammatthsangrah kii navaneet tikaa
 It can be said from the basis of this introduction that even after two and a half thousand years the policy-making section has not been separated
 lanka main jis samay tripitak par atthakathaon kii rachana kii ja rahi thi, usee samay duusari ore kuch granthkaaron main aitihaasik ruchi jaagrath hui jiske parinamswaroop dipavansh kii rachana kii gai
 The history of Lanka is described in these texts, from the earliest times to the reign of King Mahasena
 is rachana kaa upyog buddhaghosh ne apni atthakathaon main prachurtaa se kiya he or kahin-kahin uske avataran bhi die hai
 In this way, the composition of Deepavans is proved between the fourth and fifth centuries AD
 sinhal ke raajaaon ke saath-saath yahan buddha ke jivan, unke shishyon kii parampara evam teenon sangitiyon aadi kaa vivaran kuch badha chadhaakar kiya gaya he
 Presumably, the basis of its subject has been the above mentioned Sinhala story
 yah rachana pali-gadhy-mishrit he, style bahut kuch shithil he, punaruktiyaan bhi bahut he or rachana bhashaa, chand aadi ke dosha se mukt nahin he
 These characteristics are indicative of its antiquity and there is evidence that the content in it has been compiled from many sources and there was no special effort to bring editorial system in it
 kintu aitihaasik drushti se lanka main aadi se hi iskaa bada aadar rahaa he
 It is said that in the 5th century AD, Sinhala king Dhatusen taught it with national pride on the occasion of an annual festival
 bhartiya aitihaasik rachnaao main dipawans ni:sadeh ek prachinatam rachana he
 Some time after the creation of Deep Vansh, Mahanavas were created by Mahanam
 iskaa muladhar bhi ve hi sinhal kii atthakathaayen tathaa dipavansh he
 Here the rendering of the subject is more vivid and systematic than that of Deepavansh
 bhashaa bhi apekshaakrit adhik parimarjeet or style to kahin kahin mahakavyon kii paddati kaa samaran karaati he
 The original portion of the Mahavansha is of 37 passages and ends on the reign of Mahasena, similar to the Dipavansh
 prarambh ke parichchhedon main, jo lanka main bauddhadharm ke aagaman se purv desh kii dharmik paristhitiyon ke ullekh aae hai, ve aitihaasik drushti se bade mahatvapurn hai
 For example, the reign of the Pandyakamayya king is said to have lasted for 60 years before the entry of Buddhism into Lanka by Mahendra
 is raja ne 70 varsh rajya kiya tathaa rajya ke 10wein varsh main hi anuradhapur nagar kii sthapana kii
 Beyond this, additions have been made from time to time in this composition
 37wein pariched kii 50veen gaatha se aage 79wein pariched tak kii rachana sthavir dharmakirti krit he or usamen mahasen ke kaal se lekar parakrambahu pratham tak 78 raajaaon kii vanshaparampara di gai he
 This passage from the Mahavansh and beyond is called the Chulavansh
 chulvansh 80 se 90 tak ke 11 parichchhedon ke rachayita buddharakshit bhikshu ne aagaamee 23 raajaaon kaa varnan kiya jo parakrambahu chaturth tak aayaa
 10 passages from 91 to 100 were composed by Sumangal Ther and described 24 kings from Bhuvanekabhu III to the period of Kirtishree Raj Singh
 yahan lanka main isai dharm ke prachaar kii bhi soochna milti he
 The next 101st passage was composed by Sumangalacharya and Devarakshita
 tatpashchaat vahaan kaa rajya angrejon ke haath main chale jane kii bhi soochna he
 The last outgrowth of the great dynasty was published in 1936 by the monk Pragyanand Nayak and contains the history of Lanka from 1815 to 1935 AD
 is prakaar mahavansh kii rachana main chah granthkaaron kaa haath he jinke dwaara isamen bhagwaan buddha se lekar lagbhag dhai hajaar varshon kaa lanka kaa itihaas avichhinn rup se ankit kiya gaya he
 This book is also a symbol of how the Pali language was kept alive in Lanka for the said long period and the stream of literary work was never allowed to dry up in it
 dipavansh or mahavansh rachanaaon ne teevr aitihaasik vritti jaagrath kii
 As a result, many other books called the dynasty were composed
 isamen aitihaasik tathy to praaia: ukt donon granthon se hi liye gaye hai, kintu unamem jo naanaa vishyon kii shrutiparampara ko ekatra kar diya gaya he, vah mahatvapurn he
 In order to give importance to the subject, a lot of exaggerations and fantasies have also been taken shelter, due to which the historian starts to develop excitement or insolence
 is prakaar kii mukhya rachanaayen ye hai - In the above texts, for the most part, the ancient Tripitaka, their stories and the dialogue under Mahavansh is merely a repetition or elaboration
 kintu phir bhi unamem apane apane vishay kii kuch moulikta bhi he jiske aadhaar se hamen ukt vishyon kaa kuch itihaas buddhakaal se lagaakar ab tak kaa avichhinn rup main praapt hota he

 The basis of theoretical chemistry is the correct knowledge of the nature of atoms and the properties of bonding between them
 parmaanu sambandhi aadhunik manyata ke aadi purush dalton maane jate hai
 But 600 years before Christ, Kanad Muni's conception of atoms, which is very long ago, surprisingly matches Dalton's concept
 kanad ne na keval parmaanuon ko tatwon kii aisi laghutam avibhajya ikai mana jinamein is tatv ke samast gun upasthit hote hai balki aisi ikai ko "parmaanu" naam bhi unhone hi diya tathaa yah bhi kaha ki parmaanu swatantra nahin rah sakate
 Kanad's notion of atomicity is rooted in his Vaishyasika formula
 kanad aage yah bhi kehete hai ki ek prakaar ke do parmaanu sanyukt hokar "dvinuk" kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 This dichotomy seems to be the "venereal mucule" of today's chemists
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki bhinn bhinn padaarthon ke parmaanu bhi aapas main sanyukt ho sakate hai
 Here kanads are definitely pointing towards chemical bonding
 vaisheshik sutara main parmaanuon ko satat gatisheel bhi mana gaya he tathaa dravya ke sangrakshan kii bhi baat kahi gai he
 These things are also compatible with modern beliefs
 rasinic bandhata ko or adhik spasht karte hue jain darshan main kaha gaya he ki kuch parmaanuon main snigdhata or kuch main "rukshata" ke gun hote hai tathaa aisi bhinn prakruti vaale parmaanu aapas main sahajata se sanyukt ho sakate hai jabaki samaan prakruti ke parmaanuon main saamanyat: sanyog kii pravriti nahin hoti

 He has finally asked, "can any other furnace in the world compete with these furnaces?" Likewise, Madras-based Assistant Surveyor General Captain J
 Cambell wrote, "from what i have seen of Indian iron, the worst iron in India is like the best iron in England
 " The fame of ancient India in the world in the field of chemistry has been mainly for its metallurgical skills

 In Sanskrit literature, a proper description of the cinnabar ores of Parad and the Calabar ores of zinc are available
 arthshaastra main hi anekon ayskon main mishrit carbonic ashuddhiyon se mukti kii kriya bhi varnit he
 For this, there is a law to decompose by heating at high temperature
 acarbonic ashuddhiyon se mukti ke liye rasaratna samucchy main ayask ke saath bahr padaarth, flux ko milakar or is mishran ko garm kar unhen dhaatumal ke rup main alag kar dene kaa vidhaan he
 These fluxes have been found at all excavation sites of metalworking

 It is visible that the use of skull in place of iron latch is described in Kautilya's time
 yahaan yah khopadi bhi sanrandhra padaarth kaa hi kaary karti thi, jisamen sisa avashoshit ho jaataa hoga
 Kautilya has written that gold can be obtained in native form from the water or rocks of rivers

 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible

 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy

 In the event of crop failure, the moneylenders loaned the farmers more interest and cheated the illiterate farmers in many ways

 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he
 This was against the religious sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers
 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai

 har arohi unheen keel ke langaron kaa prayog karte hue chadhataa he or antim arohi lungar nikaal letaa he
 Sometimes bollards or icicles are also used
 yah us dasha main atyant upyogi rahete hai jab sari team ek saath hi girane lage
 is takanic ko simul-chadhaai ke rup main janaa jaataa he or kabhi kabhi ise khadi barf or aasaan chattan par bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 If climbing is extremely difficult and steep, then standard technique is suitable
 isamen sabhi ek-ek kar chadhate hai oe ek sthaan par pahunch kar peeche aane vaale kaa intazaar karte hai
 The convoy moves only after everyone has gathered in one place
 paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par parvatarohi bhinn-bhinn aashrayon kaa prayog karte hai
 Weather in the mountains can be very unpredictable so shelter is a very important aspect of safety for climbers
 oonche pahaado par kai dinon tak deraa daalane kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 The "base camp" is used to attempt to visit the summit
 aadhaar shivi upar kii kathin paristhitiyon se surakshit sthanon par banaaye jate hai
 Base camps are located on many popular or dangerous mountains
 jahaan shikhar tak ek hi din main nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa he, ek se adhik aadhaar shivi banaaye jate hai
 For example, in addition to the base camp, there are 4 other camps in the ridge along the southeast ridge of Everest
 vishesh rup se europea alpine kshetron main pahari jhopadiyon kaa ek network he
 In France they are known as Refuges, Refugi in Italy, Cabanas in Switzerland, Hätten in Germany and Austria, Coca in Slovenia, Refugios in Spain, and Haight in Norway
 aise jhopadiyaan ucch pahaado sahit kai alag-alag unchaaiyon par maujuud hoti hai, haalaanki adhik doordaraj kshetron main adhik moulik aashray maujuud hote hai
 Mountain huts are of different sizes and varieties, but each usually has a social dining room and has sleeping facilities equipped with mattresses, blankets or duvets and pillows
 mehmaanon se apeksha kii jaati he ki ve apane bistar swayan le kar aayen
 suvidhaayen aamtaur par moulik hoti hai, parantu aise kathin vaataavaran main ve atyant mahatvapurn aashray pradaan karti hai
 Apart from this, they also work to make the routes more widely accessible as the ascenders are able to stop here and rest in the journey and they are also relieved by lifting heavy equipment
 atah parvatarohan main inkaa amuly sthaan mana jaataa he
 In all the huts in Europe, employees are present during the summer season and some in the spring
 In other places, these huts are also found open in the fall
 kuch jhopadiyon main ek hissaa hameshaa khulaa rahata he
 They are unmanned and are called Winter Hut
 jab yah khuli hoti hai tab yah jhopadiyaan vetan paane vaale karmchaariyon dwaara chalaayi jaati hai, haalaanki inamen se kuch ko svaichhik karmchaaree bhi chalaate hai jo alpine klbon ke sadsy hote hai jaise ki swiss alpine club tathaa club alpine francas
 jhopadi ke prabandhak, jinhen europe main abhibhavak yaa varden kehete hai, aamtaur par jalpan or bhojan bechney kaa kaam bhi karte hai
 This facility is available to both those staying overnight and those staying only during the day
 yah dekhte hue ki aksar pani sahit adhikansh vasteen helicopter dwaara laayi jaati hai, bhojan kaaphi vistrut hota he
 This includes glucose-rich foods, cakes and pastries made there, hot and cold drinks including beer and wine, and high-carbohydrate foods for dinner
 sabhi jhopadiyaan haalaanki yah suvidhaayen nahin pradaan karatin, tathaa kuch main aagantukon ko swayan apana intazaam karnaa hota he
 On the other hand some huts provide both types of facilities
 aagatuk vyay kam rakhane ke liye apni khaadya saamagree va pakaane ke upkarnon kaa prayog kar sakate hai athwa adhik vyay karne waalon ke liye pakaa hua bhojan bhi uplabdh rahata he
 Overnight reservation is considered mandatory, and in some popular places it is also necessary as 100 bed facilities are also filled on good weather or on weekends! The cancellation of a reservation made once is considered polite, because the employees of these huts keep a record of every ascending route and climbing plan with great diligence to ensure the security of the ascension
 All huts can be contacted by telephone and credit cards are accepted for payment in all
 parvatarohan ke sandarbh main, padaav yaa bivi ek aaraam yaa sone kii asthaayee vyavastha he, jisamen parvatarohi ko camping kii paaramparik jagah main uplabdh thaharne, khaane or upkarnon kii purna suvidhaon se kam suvidha praapt hoti he
 This may include taking only a sleeping bag and stop bag and sleeping
 kai baar chote aanshik aashray kshetron jaise himandon kii daraaron, chattaanon ke kataavon or barf main bani khaaion kaa prayog hawaaon se bachaav ke liye kiya jaataa he
 These techniques were actually used in emergencies; Although when time and appropriate snow conditions are not available to build icy caves, some climbers are constantly devoted to alpine style as a special plan for a halt so that the weight of the tent is saved
 The main risk related to these stops is the presence of a large amount of cold
 tamboo parvaton main sarvaadhik upyog hone vaale aashray hai
 These can range from simple tarpaulin pieces to extremely heavy designs that help to avoid the harsh conditions of the mountain
 niraavaran kii sthiti main, tamboo lagane ke liye barf yaa chattan ke peeche lagane kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 One danger of tenting is that strong winds and heavy snowfall can be dangerous and due to this the tent can break and break
 iske alaava, tamboo ke kapade kii nirantar fadafadaahat se neend main baadha utpann ho sakati he tathaa aashray kii suraksha ke prati ashanka bad sakati he
 When choosing a tent, ascensors rely on special mountaineering tents that are specially built to withstand strong winds and heavy snowfall
 tamboo ke khunton ko atirikt suraksha ke liye barf main dabaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 
 jahaan paristithiyaan anukool ho to barf kii gufaaen bhi parvat par aashray kaa ek anya tarika he
 Many climbers do not use tents at very high altitudes as long as the ice conditions permit them to stay in ice caves, as ice caves are much warmer and quieter than tents
 inhen ek barf ke fawde kaa prayog karke paryaapt samay dekar apekshaakrit aasaani se banaaya ja saktaa he
 The temperature of a properly constructed ice cave will hover around zero, relative to which the outside temperature may be warmer
 inhen aisi kisi bhi jagah khoda ja saktaa he jahaan kam se kam chaar feet barf ho
 quinzi ek anya prakaar kaa aashray he, jise barf ke dher ko majboot karke banaaya jaataa he
 Igloo is used by some climbers, but it is difficult to make and requires some special icy conditions
 parvatarohan main kai baar khatre ko do shreniyon main vibhajit kiya jaataa hai: vastugat khatre jo parvatarohi ke upasthit na hone par bhi upasthit hote hai, jaise chattaanon kaa girnaa, himaskhalan or karaab mausam or vyaktiparak khatre jo parvatarohi dwaara shuru karkon se hi sambandhit hote hai
 Equipment malfunction and breakdown due to inadvertence, fatigue and inadequate technique are examples of subjective danger
 tufaanon or himaskhalan ke kaaran nirantar parivartit hone vaale raste ko vastugat khatre kaa ucch str mana jaataa he, jabaki takneekee rup se zyada kathin rasta jo in khataron se apekshaakrit surakshit hota he use vastugat rup se surakshit mana ja saktaa he
 In short, climbers should keep in mind these dangers: falling rocks, falling snow, avalanches, falling climbers, falling off icy slopes, falling icy slopes, falling into icy crevices and elevation and weather hazards
 The skill of a climber is tested in choosing and following a path using their skills and experience to reduce these hazards
 prayek chattan kataav ke kaaran dhire-dhire bikharati he, yah prakriya vishesh rup se barf-rekha ke upar tej hoti he
 The shape of the rocks changes continuously due to falling of stones, due to which deception can occur
 girti chattaane parvat par gadde bana detii hai or in gaddhon par kaaphi saavdhaanee se chadhana hota he, inke kinare praayah surakshit hote hai jabaki madhya bhaag par pathar girte rahete hai
 The rocks fall more than anything else according to the current season
 raat main bani barf chattaanon ko upar se asthaayee taur par baandh sakati he lekin din kii badhati garmi yaa barf ke pighalane par bahata pani yaa varsha in chattaanon ko hataa sakati he
 Local experiences prove valuable for detecting rocks falling on such paths
 chattan kii parat ke jhukaav kii disha se kai baar vishisht sthiti par khatre kii gambhirtha kaa pataa chal jaataa he; chattan kii prakruti par bhi vichaar zarur karnaa chahie
 jahaan pathar aksar girte hon vahaan neeche uske tukade paae jaayenge, tathaa barf par pathar girane se bade gadde ban jate hai jo dur se hi nazar aa jate he
 Climbers should pay special attention to such marks in planning to climb a new peak or an unfamiliar route
 When the falling stones meet a large number of mud ice or water, ejaculation of mud is formed
 Camping should be avoided in such potential slopes
 barf girane kii prabal sambhaavna vaale sthanon kaa sateek purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 It falls into the broken parts of the glaciers and from the hanging ridges built on the summit of the Sakari mountain range
 bade himalambon kaa nirmaan kadi chattaanon par hota he or ye thande or tufaani dinon ko jhelti hui achche mausam main zyada girti hai
 Like falling stones, it is also important to avoid them
 himand atyant dhire banate hai or asthir santulan kii sthiti par bhi dhire pahonchte hai 
 ve aam taur par din ke sabase ooshna bhaag main yaa uske turant baad girte hai
 a skilled and experienced ascension will usually consider the safest route between the most complex paths of falling snow, but still avoid such places in the afternoon of hot days
 The hanging glaciers often move away from the steep cliffs after a certain period of time
 inhen hameshaa neeche pade inke malbe se pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 It should always be avoided along the way
 ek shila parvatarohi kii dakshata uske pad va hast rakhane ke vikalp, tathaa chayan karne ke baad unako jamaaye rakhane ke kaushal se zaahir hoti he
 This depends to a large extent on the ability to estimate the capacity of the rock on which it stands
 kai kamjor chattaane ek vyakti kaa vajan sahane ke liye paryaapt majboot hoti hai, lekin yah jaanane ke liye anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he ki kis par vishwaas karen or bina marode vajan ko sthanantarit karne ke liye kaushal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Special attention is required when roping on some weak rocks, because they are prone to fall under the stone
 isi tarah inpar pair va haath rakhte hue bhi uchit dhyaan dena chahie
 kaaphi jatil chattaanon se pratibandhak ko paar karte samay, ek khatarnaak sthiti bad sakati he jabatak ki pratibandhak kii donon sthitiyaan atal na hon
 kathor chattaanon par aapasi sahaayta kaa bada mahatva hota he
 Two or three ascensors move with the help of each other, or by placing feet on the ice ax applied by the other to the feet
 The most important principle of mutual cooperation is that all the members of the party climb on each other's support and not as an independent entity; Each of the members moving forward should know what the front and back ascension is doing
 kharaab mausam ke baad khadi chattaanon par barf kii ek parat praayah pai jaati he, jo ise or bhi durgam bana detii he
 In such a situation, Krempon is very beneficial
 himaskhalan pahaado main sabase kam aankaa jane vaala khatra he
 People generally think that they will be able to identify and avoid these threats
 The truth is actually quite different
 har saal 120 se 150 log keval alps main hi chote himskhalanon main maare jate hai
 They mostly consist of experienced male skiers in the age group of 20 to 35, but also include ski directors and guides
 barf kii pathaar ko paar karne main hameshaa khatre kaa dabaav rahata he
 It takes a lot of time and effort to go back, excellent leadership, and most importantly an avalanche that proves that the right decision was taken
 mudane kaa nirnay lenaa tab or kathin ho jaataa he jab anya log bhi dhalaan ko paar kar rahe hon, lekin koi bhi aglaa vyakti kaaran ban saktaa he
 There are many types of avalanches, but two types are of most concern: khatarnaak phislan vaale khand sabase zyada usee jagah hote hai jis jagah ko skirs dwaara sabase zyada pasand kiya jaataa he: lambe or chaude khule hue, kuch ped yaa badi chattaane, 30 se 45 degree kaa kone, taaja barf kii bhari maatr, bade toofaan ke baad, tufaani dhalaan par
 saura vikiran se bhi skhalan kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 These will mostly be point release or wet mud type avalanches
 The weight attached in the wet slide ejaculation turns on the ejaculation
 himaskhalan kaa shikaar hue nabbe pratishat shikaar unke dwaara swayan yaa unke samooh ke anya arohiyon dwaara hi armbh kiye jate hai 
 Time parties are always advised to carry these items while traveling off-piste on Alpine routes
 arohiyon ko himaskhalan prashikshan kii salaah bhi di jaati he
 Ironically, the highest percentage of deaths in avalanches are from expert skiers who have undergone avalanche training; Probably because they prefer to ski in avalanche areas and perhaps because some people do not practice enough with their equipment to become fast and fit free
 uchit bachaav upkaran or prashikshan ke saath bhi, kisi bade himaskhalan main funsane par paanch main se ek kii marane sambhaavna hoti he or kuch minute ke liye dafan ho jane par jinda bachane kii sambhaavna aadhi hoti he
 The best solution is to learn how to avoid risky situations
 barf yaa kade himpat vaali dhalaanon par yatra karte samay, crempons parvatarohi ke upkarnon kaa ek maanak bhaag hote hai
 While step-cutting can be used many times on the snowy slopes of the medium angle, it is still a slow and tedious process, which does not provide high protection for the creampons
 haalanki, naram barf yaa powder main, crempons aasaani se funs jate hai, jis kaaran se inkaa prabhaav kam ho jaataa he
 In the other case, the ice ax not only helps, but also helps in handling themselves in the event of an ascension falling or sliding
 phir bhi ek asli barfili dhalaan par, barf kii kulhadi bahut kam hi khud ko pakadaney main prabhavi hoti he
 As an added precaution for safety to stand on the slope of the ice, the ice screws should be tied to the mountaineering rope
 europe main asli barfili dhalaan durlabh he, yadhyapi ushnkaribandheey kshetron main kaaphi saamaanya he, jahaan giri hui naveen barf sataha par jald hi pigal jaati he or niche bah jaati he, isliye agali raat kii thand main puraa drav ardg-sakht barf kii sheet main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Snow slopes are common and climbing is also common
 himpad yaa barf kii dhalaan ke neeche saamanytah ek badi him daraar hoti he, jise bergascrand kehete hai, jahaan parvat kii antim dhalaan barf-kshetra yaa himand se nikalati he
 Such berkskronds are too wide to cross and must be crossed by an ice bridge, which requires careful testing and use of an entrapped rope
 ek khasta haal khadi barf kii dhalaan khatarnaak ho sakati he kyonki isaki barf kaa puraa bhaag ek skhalan ke rup main armbh ho saktaa he
 It is much safer if it is climbed upright in place of sloping on such slopes, because it starts cutting them diagonally or horizontally and their fluid starts flowing
 jami barf par giri nayi barf vishesh rup se khatarnaak hoti he
 In case of a suspicious snow condition, progress needs to be checked
 chattaanon par himpat aksar karaab hota he jabatak ki vah sakht na ho jaae; barf par barf ek sa lagata he
 a two-day clear weather will bring snow in good condition
 Snow cannot lie in a very steep angle, although the eyes may be deceived by its slope
 barf kii dhalaan kadaachit 40 degree tak jhuki ho sakati he
 Hard frozen ice persists to greater angles
 subah barf kii dhalaane kadi or surakshit hoti hai, parantu isi prakaar se dopaher main kuch narm or khatarnaak hoti jaati hai; isliye jaldi chalane main phayda he
 Snow cracks are cracks or deep ditches that form when a glacial material passes through an uneven plane
 ye khuli yaa chhipi hui ho sakati hai
 Snow cracks open in the lower parts of the glacier
 barf rekha ke upar ye praayah sardi kii barf ke dhanushakar sanchay se chhip jate hai
 Detecting hidden cracks is a work of great care and experience
 taaja barf ke girane ke baad inhen barf kii kulhadi kii chhad kii aawaaj dwaara pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he, yaa daanye or baanye dekhakar jahaan aanshik rup se dhaki him daraar kaa konaa bilkul khulaa ho saktaa he
 The rope is the only protection against accident, and no one should ever cross a glacier covered with snow unless they have a rope, or have two companions
 daraaron ko paar karne vaale kisi bhi vyakti ko him daraar se bachaav main bhi paarangat hona chahie
 Changes in snow and rock conditions are mainly dangerous due to bad weather, these events occurring more suddenly than normal conditions are more difficult and harmful
 barf kii safed chadar main kisi raste kaa punah pataa lagaana kathin he jabaki barish sukhi sthitiyon ke sabase aasaan raste main jane se bhi rokatii he
 Climbers using the compass for direction benefit more than just experienced observers in the storm
 bilkul, bade barfile kshetron main, chattan ki tulana main galat raste par janaa aam hota he, lekin vatugat khataron se surakshit bachakar nikalne ke liye buddhi or anubhav sabase achche sahaayak hai
 Summer thunderstorms can also produce intense electricity
 agar parvatarohi shikhar par yaa uske nikat hon to maare jane kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 There are many cases in which lightning was killed while climbing the mountain
 zyaadaatar pahari kshetron main, sthaneey toofaan subah ke baad or dopaher ke pehle utpann hote hai
 Most ascensions take "alpine onset"; Which happens before dawn or first ray to protect against storm activity and lightning speed and other seasonal hazards
 Strong winds can inhibit the invasion of hypothermia, as well as destroying equipment such as tents used for shelter
 In some specific conditions, storms can also create waterfalls, causing the process of mountaineering to slow or stop
 ayijar parvat par phan hawaaen iskaa jeeta jaagta udahaaran hai
 Rapid climbing can cause 'attitude Sickness'
 iskaa sabase acha ilaaj yah he ki turant neeche utar aaye
 bahut oonchaai par arohi kaa naaraa yah hota he ki "ooncha chadho, kam so", jiskaa arth he ki sangrakshak abhyast hone ke liye oonche parvat par chadhe lekin sone ke liye neeche utar aae
 dakshin america ke andes main, atitude sickness beemaari se bachane ke liye paaramparik rup se coca kii pattiyon chabaaya jaataa rahaa he
 Common symptoms of Attitude Sickness are severe headache, sleep problems, nausea, loss of appetite, lethargy and body pain
 parvatiy kamajori badhkar hes or hep main parivartit ho saktaa he, in donon se 24 ghante ke andar maut ho sakati he
 In high mountains, the atmospheric pressure is low and for this reason there is a lack of oxygen for breath
 yah atitude sickness kaa aadharbhoot kaaran he
 Everyone needs to get used to it, even those experienced climbers who have climbed to such heights before
 saamanyatya, 7000 meter se upar kii chadhaai karte samay parvatarohi bottleband kritrim oxygen kaa prayog kar lete hai
 Some special climbers climb to the peak of 8000 meters without oxygen, for which there is always a well planned exercise
 oonchai main saura vikiran kaaphi bad jaataa he kyonki oonchaai badhane par vayumandal patala hota jaataa he jis kaaran se yah kam parabangnee vikiran ko avashoshit karata he
 The snow cover can be obstructed by reflecting radiation, which increases the risk of sun scorching and snow blindness by up to 75%
 2005 main, shodhakarta or parvatarohi jon sample ne yah siddh kiya ki tibeti pathaar main ausat se adhik ozon sandratha parvatarohiyon ke liye ek atirikt jokhim kaa jokhim khadaa kar sakati he
 Some mountains are active volcanoes such as conjoined volcanoes that form the highest peak of the island divisions and in some parts of the Andes
 in jwalamukheey parvaton ke fatne ke kaaran kai khatre utpann ho sakate hai, jaise lahare, pyroklastik pravaah, chattaanon kaa girnaa, lava bahna, bhari maatra main tephra kaa girnaa, jwalamukhi bam kaa fatna or toxic gaisen
 == Mountaineering styles == There are two main styles of mountaineering: expedition climbing and Alpine system
 == Styling Shalya == Mountaineering Both main styles are: 'mohimevar Chadhai' and 'alpine System'
 Mountaineering has gained popularity as an Alpine method in Europe

 In the US, Mount Chadhane is a unique style with high snowmelt, rock climbing and alloy assortment of mixtures, mixing with the whole material all over
 The term Alpine method used in the US is used with the ascent of campaign style where ascensors use porters, cargo animals, cooks, etc
 to carry their belongings and food

 Himalayya Mohimechya Shailachi Halacha is the main theme or Bhagatil Dongrachaya Swaroopamule
 Since camping in the Himalayas can take several days or weeks to travel, and it may take several weeks or perhaps months to climb the Himalayan mountains, a considerable amount of useful goods are required

 yahi kaaran he ki aksar himalay kii badi or sudur chotiyon par abhiyaan style hi prayog kii jaati he
 Due to that, Mohim's style of Himalayya Mothya and the inaccessible Shikharavarch used to go to Vaparli
 The need for expedition style in Europe and North America is less because most of the mountains can be reached by air or by car, are less high and can be climbed in a day or two

 Bhaj Govindam 5th century BC Is a popular Hindu devotional work written in Sanskrit, and is credited to Adi Shankaracharya for writing it
 yah rachana yah rekhaankit karti he ki prabhu ke prati bhakthi saamaanya aadhyatm kaa ek ati mahatvapurn bhaag he, jiskaa ki bhakthi yoga va bhakthi andolan dwaara samarthan kiya gaya he
 This classic creation is a souvenir of the fact that Adi Shankar, who is considered to be the great pioneer of the path of knowledge, did not hesitate to praise Bhakti as having reached the same goal
 tathaa jaisaa ki chakravarti rajagopalaachari ne apane bhashya main likhaa he, jab budhimatta paripakv hoti he to hriday main jamkar jaden jamaa leti he, vah pragna ban jaati he
 When that wisdom is combined with life and takes the form of action, then devotion becomes
 gyaan jo paripakv hota he bhakthi kehalaata he
 If it does not turn into devotion then it is useless

 The word Pagoda is used in Nepal, India, Varma, Indonesia, Thailand, China, Japan and other eastern countries to erect pillar temples built on the remains of Lord Buddha or a saint
 inhen stupa bhi kehete hai
 One speculation is that the word pagoda may have been used in Sanskrit as "dagoba"
 burmi granthon main pagoda lanka kii bhashaa sinhalai ke shabd "dagoba" kaa vigada rup bataaya gaya he or dagoba ko sanskrit ke shabd dhaatugarbha se sambandhit kaha gaya he, jiskaa arth he "punit avasheshon kii sthapana kaa sthal"
 Pagodas are usually listlike, domed, or turret shaped
 13 manjilon or 200 foot oonchaai tak ke pagode bane hai
 On the mast of the pagodas of India and East Asia, many state-owned umbrellas are mounted on a mast
 bharat main pagode praaia: mandiron ke dwaar par athwa mukhya murtisthal ke upar banaae jate hai
 The pillars in the pagodas of China and Japan are square, polygonal, or circular in shape
 usamen anek, bahudhaa paanch, manzilen hoti hai
 On each storey there are outstretched ceilings in which bronze bells hang
