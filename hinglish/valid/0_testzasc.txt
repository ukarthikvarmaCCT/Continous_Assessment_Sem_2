 Pay per click is an internet advertising model used on websites where advertisers pay their hosts only when their ad is clicked
 khoj injanon ke saath, vigyapandaata aamtaur par apane lakshith bazaar ke liye praasangik khojshabd vaakyanshon par hi boli lagaate hai
 Content sites typically charge a fixed price per click, rather than using a bidding system

 There are two main models for per click pricing: flat rate and bid based
 In both cases it is necessary for the advertiser to consider the potential value of a click from a given source
 yah mulya is baat par aadhaarit hota he ki vigyapandaata apni website ke liye kis prakaar ke vyakti ko ek aagatuk ke rup main praapt karne kii ummid karata he or vigyapandaata alpavadhi tathaa dderghaavadhi main usase kis prakaar kaa laabh praapt karne kii ummid kar saktaa he
 Like other forms of advertising, goal setting is also important here, and the factors most often affecting PPC campaigns include the target's interest, intent, location, and the day and time they browse
 flats rate model main, vigyapandaata or prakaashak prayek clic ke liye ek nishchit raashi ke bhugtan par sahamat hote hai
 In many cases the publisher has a rate card that lists the CPC for different areas of their website or network

 Each advertiser informs the host about the maximum amount they can offer to receive an ad space; For this he usually uses online tools
 nilaamee, har baar kisi aagatuk dwaara vigyaapan sthaan ko trigar karne par ek swachaalit tareeke se aage badhati he
 When the ad space is part of a search engine result page), the automatic auction also begins whenever the keyword being bid is searched
 uske baad khojakarta ke sthaan, khoj ke din tathaa samay aadi ko darj karne vaale khojshabd kii sabhi boliyon kii tulana kii jaati he or vijeta kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Having more than one ad position, as is often the case on serps, can have more than one winner whose position on the page is determined by the amount they bid
 ucchtam boli vaala vigyaapan aam taur par sabase pehle dikhaai detaa he, haalanki vigyaapan gunvattta tathaa praasangikta jaise anya kaarak bhi is par prabhaav daal sakate hai 
 In addition to ad space on serps, the main advertising networks allow relevant advertisements to be shown on their participating third-party properties
 ye prakaashak network kii ore se vigyaapan pradarshit karne ke liye anubandhit hote hai
 In return, they receive a portion of the advertising revenue generated by the network, which can be 50% to 80% of the gross revenue paid by advertisers
 in sampattiyon ko aksar content network or unpar pradarshit vigyaapan ko praasangik vigyaapan kaha jaataa he, kyonki vigyaapan sthaan praasangik prishth ke sandarbh par aadhaarit khojashabdon se sambandhit hote hai
 In general, the click-through rate and conversion rate of ads on content networks are much lower than those found on serps, and therefore their value remains low
 content network sampattiyon main website, samachar patr or email shaamil ho sakate hai
 Advertisers pay for each click and the actual payment amount is based on the bid amount
 nilaamee karne vaale mejabaan aamtaur par vijeta bolidaata se, agle sarvocch bolidaata athwa boli kii vaastavik raashi se thodi adhik raashi dene ke liye kehete hai
 By doing so, situations can be avoided where the bidders continuously reduce their bids by slightly lowering their payment amount for each click to become the winner in the auction
 safalataa ko adhiktam karne or vyapaar kii maatra badhaane ke liye swachaalit boli prabandhan pranaaliyon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 These systems can be used directly by the advertiser, although they are mostly used by advertising agencies that offer PPC bid management as a service

 The system typically sets each bid according to its stated goal, such as maximizing profits, maximizing the number of visitors without making any profits or losses, etc
 The system is usually linked to the advertiser's website and the results of each click are recorded, based on which it determines the bid
 in pranaaliyon kii prabhavakaarita sidhe taur par praasangik pradarshan data kii gunvattta or maatra se sambandhit hoti he; kam yatayaat vaale vigyaapan, data kii kami se judi samasya ko paidaa kar sakate hai jo kai boli prabandhan upkarnon ko bekaar yaa aksham kar saktaa he

 There are many references to this
 valmiki ramayana- mahabharat - tathaa brahmpurana- main tapasvi chaarnon ke prasang mil jate hai
 The context of Brahmapurana makes it clear that Maharaj Prithu was the one who settled the barns on the ground
 unhone chaarnon ko tailang desh kaa shaasha banaaya or inhone tailang desh par raaj kiya
 Bard spread everywhere

 From here, all these spread to the kings

 The evidence of this thing is difficult for us to see in Vedas and Puranas
