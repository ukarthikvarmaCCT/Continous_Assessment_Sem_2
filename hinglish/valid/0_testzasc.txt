 pipisi vigyaapan model kaa clic dhokhadhadi ke madhyam se durupyog kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki google or dusron ne pratiyogiyon tathaa bhrasht web developers dwaara iskaa durupyog kiye jane se rokane ke prati swachaalit pranaaliyon ko lagu kiya he
 There are two main models for per click pricing: flat rate and bid based
 In both cases it is necessary for the advertiser to consider the potential value of a click from a given source
 yah mulya is baat par aadhaarit hota he ki vigyapandaata apni website ke liye kis prakaar ke vyakti ko ek aagatuk ke rup main praapt karne kii ummid karata he or vigyapandaata alpavadhi tathaa dderghaavadhi main usase kis prakaar kaa laabh praapt karne kii ummid kar saktaa he
 Like other forms of advertising, goal setting is also important here, and the factors most often affecting PPC campaigns include the target's interest, intent, location, and the day and time they browse
 flats rate model main, vigyapandaata or prakaashak prayek clic ke liye ek nishchit raashi ke bhugtan par sahamat hote hai
 In many cases the publisher has a rate card that lists the CPC for different areas of their website or network
 ye vibhinn rashiyaan aksar prishthon kii saamagree se sambandhit hoti hai, jahaan aam taur par adhik moolyawaan aagantukon ko aakarshith karne vaali saamagree kii sipisi kam moolyawaan aagantukon ko aakarshith karne vaali saamagree kii apeksha adhik hoti he
 However, in many cases advertisers can deal at a lower rate, especially when it comes to signing a long-term or high-value contract
 flats rate model vishesh rup se tulanaatmak kharid injanon main adhik aam he, jo saamanytah apane rate card ko prakashit karte hai
 However, these rates are sometimes quite low and advertisers may pay more for more visibility
 ye citen aamtaur par utpaada yaa seva shreniyon main kaaphi karine se banty hoti hai jisase vigyapandaataaon ko lakshyikaran kaa ek ucch str praapt karne main madad milti he
 In many cases, the entire original content of these sites is filled with paid advertisements
 boli aadhaarit model main vigyapandaata ek anubandh par hastakshar karata he jo unhen kisi prakaashak yaa aamtaur par kisi vigyaapan network dwaara yojit kii gayi nijee nilaamee main anya vigyapandaataaon se pratispardhaa karne kii anumati pradaan karata he
 Each advertiser informs the host about the maximum amount they can offer to receive an ad space; For this he usually uses online tools
 nilaamee, har baar kisi aagatuk dwaara vigyaapan sthaan ko trigar karne par ek swachaalit tareeke se aage badhati he
 When the ad space is part of a search engine result page), the automatic auction also begins whenever the keyword being bid is searched
 uske baad khojakarta ke sthaan, khoj ke din tathaa samay aadi ko darj karne vaale khojshabd kii sabhi boliyon kii tulana kii jaati he or vijeta kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Having more than one ad position, as is often the case on serps, can have more than one winner whose position on the page is determined by the amount they bid
 ucchtam boli vaala vigyaapan aam taur par sabase pehle dikhaai detaa he, haalanki vigyaapan gunvattta tathaa praasangikta jaise anya kaarak bhi is par prabhaav daal sakate hai 
 In addition to ad space on serps, the main advertising networks allow relevant advertisements to be shown on their participating third-party properties
 ye prakaashak network kii ore se vigyaapan pradarshit karne ke liye anubandhit hote hai
 In return, they receive a portion of the advertising revenue generated by the network, which can be 50% to 80% of the gross revenue paid by advertisers
 in sampattiyon ko aksar content network or unpar pradarshit vigyaapan ko praasangik vigyaapan kaha jaataa he, kyonki vigyaapan sthaan praasangik prishth ke sandarbh par aadhaarit khojashabdon se sambandhit hote hai
 In general, the click-through rate and conversion rate of ads on content networks are much lower than those found on serps, and therefore their value remains low
 content network sampattiyon main website, samachar patr or email shaamil ho sakate hai
 Advertisers pay for each click and the actual payment amount is based on the bid amount
 nilaamee karne vaale mejabaan aamtaur par vijeta bolidaata se, agle sarvocch bolidaata athwa boli kii vaastavik raashi se thodi adhik raashi dene ke liye kehete hai
 By doing so, situations can be avoided where the bidders continuously reduce their bids by slightly lowering their payment amount for each click to become the winner in the auction
 safalataa ko adhiktam karne or vyapaar kii maatra badhaane ke liye swachaalit boli prabandhan pranaaliyon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 These systems can be used directly by the advertiser, although they are mostly used by advertising agencies that offer PPC bid management as a service
 ye pranaliyaan aamtaur par kaaphi bade paimaane par boliyon kaa prabandhan karne main sakasham banaati hai, jahaan ek swachaalit pranali dwaara hajaaron lakhon kii sankhya main pipisi boliyon ko niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 The system typically sets each bid according to its stated goal, such as maximizing profits, maximizing the number of visitors without making any profits or losses, etc
 The system is usually linked to the advertiser's website and the results of each click are recorded, based on which it determines the bid
 in pranaaliyon kii prabhavakaarita sidhe taur par praasangik pradarshan data kii gunvattta or maatra se sambandhit hoti he; kam yatayaat vaale vigyaapan, data kii kami se judi samasya ko paidaa kar sakate hai jo kai boli prabandhan upkarnon ko bekaar yaa aksham kar saktaa he
 In February 1998, Goto
com, a new company with 25 employees, presented evidence of the concept of pay per click search engines to the TED conference in California
 is prastuti or iske baad kii ghatnaon ne pipisi vigyaapan pranali kii rachana kii

 Google started search engine advertising in December 1999
 The adwords system was introduced in October 2000, where advertisers could create text ads to appear on the Google search engine
 haalanki, pipisi ko 2002 main hi pesh kiya ja sakaa; us samay tak vigyaapan ke liye prati hajaar kii laagat ke hisaab se bhugtan praapt kiya jaataa tha

 brahma ne chaarnon kaa kaary devataaon kii stuti karnaa nirdhaarit kiya
 In the Matsya Purana, the baranas are mentioned as eulogists
 chaarnon ne sumer chhodkar aryaavart ke himalay pradesh ko apana tapakshetra banaaya, is prasang main unki bhent anek devataaon or mahapurushaan se hui
 There are many references to this

 The context of Brahmapurana makes it clear that Maharaj Prithu was the one who settled the barns on the ground

 Colonel Tad wrote: In these areas the Barans are distinguished as a valid caste
 1901 ke janaganana vivaran main captain beormen ne chaarnon ke liye likhaa he: The people living in Marwar are called 'maru' and 'kachela' of Kutch
 uparyukt uddharanon ke anusaar chaaran jati devtaa jati thi, pavitra thi, jisko sumer se himalay par or himalay se bharat main laane kaa shrey maharaj pruthu ko he

 In the Dingle literature, no songs or verses are written by the Bhats like the BƒÅrƒÅ‡§æ‡§∞‡§£as, in such a situation how the name of the Bhatas came to be taken with the BƒÅrƒÅ ,as, it is not understood

 In order to reduce the threat of the "unfettered" power of the Pope, he enacted several laws for the power of the Catholics and tried to suppress the socialist movement

 Refuting the theory of liberals, Bismarck stated his policy in 1862 as follows: bismark kaa nishchit mat tha ki germany kaa ekikaran kabhi bhi france, rus, england evam austria ko sweekaar nahin hoga kyonki sanyukt germany europe ke shakti santulan ke liye sabase bada khatra hoga
 Therefore, Bismarck was convinced that the use of power was necessary for the unification of Germany
 bismark kaa mukhya uddeshy prasha ko shaktishaalee banaakar german sangh se austria ko baahar nikaalnaa evam germany main uske prabhaav ko samaapt karke prasha ke netritv main germany kaa ekikaran karnaa tha

 bismark ne apane sampoorn kaarykram ke dauraan is baat kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhaa ki germany ke ekikaran ke liye prasha kii asmita nasht na ho jaae
 He was not willing to sacrifice Prussa, as Piedmont did for the unification of Italy
 vah prasha main hi germany ko samahit kar lenaa chahta tha
 Bismarck did not want unification of Germany from the bottom up, that is, instead of awakening the spirit of integration in a liberal way, he wanted to unify from above, that is, through diplomacy and blood and iron policies he wanted the subordination of the German states Situation should not be done
 is drushti se vah prasha ke germanykaran nahin balki germany kaa prashaakaran karnaa chahta tha
 Bismarck became chancellor of Austria in 1832 and completed the unification of Germany through his diplomacy, prudent blood and iron policy
