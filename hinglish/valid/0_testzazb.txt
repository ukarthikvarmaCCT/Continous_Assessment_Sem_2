 For example, two entries would be required to record the earning of Rs 100

 Bi-marking system In the modern era, the bi-marking system of ledger account is considered the best, all-common and omnipresent because it is modern, scientific and complete
 yah vyapaaree ke samast uddeshyo kii purti karti he
 It originated in Western countries, so it is also called Western accounting method
 ise vyapaarik lekha-vidhi-pranali bhi kaha jaataa he, kyonki is vidhi ke anusaar rokad or udhaar ke saudon ko lipibaddh kiya jaataa he
 Different scholars have given different definitions of the bi-notation system, some of which are as follows- According to Carter, 'the modern method of accounting is known as the bi-notation system
 bahikhaate kii dwi-ankan pranali kaa aashaay baiyakti tathaa avaiyaktik donon hi prakaar ke khaaton se hai
 Keylor gives the following definition of bi-marking system - 'the common system of accounting in an enterprise is bi-marking system
 jaisaa ki naam se hi vidit hota he- prayek saude ke do lekhe liye jate he- ek debit main or doosraa credit main
 Every trade transaction that results in the value of money or money, giving profit and getting that profit
 dusre shabdon main vyapaarik sauda mulya ke badale athwa dravya ke mulya main ladal-badal kaa naam he athwa prayek vyapaarik sauda do kriyaaon ko janm detaa he- kisi moolyawaan vastu ko praapt karnaa or kisi moolyawaan vastu ko dena
 According to the two-marking system, these donations, the receivable and the payable parties, are accounted for
 atah yadi ek bhawan mukesh se kharida gaya he to bhawan khaataa praapt karata he mukesh kaa khaataa detaa he
 Therefore full accounting of every transaction is required to be bi-entry
 dwi-ankal pranali ke niyamon kii spasht jaankaree ke liye yah jaan lenaa aavashyak he ki kuch saude lagbhag sab vyapaaron main samaan hote hai
 These similar deals are as follows- atah yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki sampoorn vyapaarik saudon ke purna lekhankan ke liye nimna khate rakhana aavashyak hai- The accounts which fall in the first group are called individual accounts, the accounts falling under the second group are called wealth accounts and the accounts falling in the third group are called nominal accounts
 dwi-ankan pranali prishth ko do samaan arddh-bhaagon main bantati he
 The left side of the page is called the debit side and the south side is called the credit side
 vibhinn saudon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale pakshon ke is prakaar chayan main koi nyaasangat kaaran nahin tha or credit paksh bahut saralata se vam paksh yaa debit paksh dakshin paksh ho saktaa tha
 The Venetian merchants who were the first known traders of the bi-marking system had chosen the left side or debit side for assets and the other side to represent capital and liabilities
 atah yah sab se vaisaa hi chalaa aa rahaa he
 An account is a record in which the money value of each profit given or received by a particular party and the left parties is arranged in two separate columns
 prayek khate main debit paksh evam credit paksh hota he
 This is shown by writing 'debit' and credit 'on the left and south sides of the account respectively
 debit paksh kii prayek pravishti ke aage shj vashshabd likhaa jaataa he
 This means that the account whose record is being prepared is the debtor of the account whose name is written in the entry
 duusari taraf credit paksh kii pravishti ke aage shthalash shabd likhaa jaataa he
 This means that the account whose record is being prepared is credited to the account whose name is written in the entry
 khate kaa naam khate ke upar madhya main likhaa jaataa he
 The account of the beneficiary party is called the creditor and the account of the party who receives it is called the debtor
 saamaanya rup se khate dwaara praapt laabh kii keemat ko khate main vam stambh main likhaa jaataa he or yah kaha jaataa he ki khate kii utani keemat se debit kiya gaya
 On the other hand, the amount of profit given by the account is written in the south column of the account and it is said that the account was credited at that price
 inhen kramshah debit or credit pravishtiyaan kehete hai
 a rule or principle refers to a general rule that is helpful in guiding practices or transactions
 vastav main ye siddhant mukhyatya teen niyamon par aadhaarit he ise 'doharaa lekha pranali ke siddhanth' bhi kaha jaataa he
 The rules of the two-marking system are used according to accounts
 doharaa lekha pranali main khaaton ke teen prakaar hote hai
 Before debiting or crediting a particular account, we should see that the following rules will be followed after knowing which category of accounts are affected by the transaction done by the merchant
 vyaktigat khaaton ke maamle main ham laabh praapt karne vaale vyakti yaa santhaan kaa khaataa uske dwaara praapt laabh se debit karte hai or laabh dene vaale vyakti yaa santhaan kaa khaataa uske dwaara pradutt laabh se credit karte hai
 In short we can say- sampatti khate prapti se debit or jane vaalen se credit kiye jate hai
 Or prayek vyay athwa haani kii dhan-raashi ko debit kiya jaataa he or prayek aay athwa laabh kii dhanrashi ko credit kiya jaataa he
 In other words - yah jaan lenaa aavashyak he ki yah niyam kabhi nahin badalte or har sambhav dasha main inkaa dridhtaa se prayog kiya jaayegaa
 It should also be noted that the above mentioned systems such as 'giver' and 'giver', 'incoming' and 'goer' etc
 should be examined from the perspective of the institution rather than from the owner's point of view
 dwi-ankan pranali ke uparyukt niyamon ke atirikt lekhankan kii kuch avdhaaranein tathaa manyataayen hai
 It is necessary to know these before starting the actual bookkeeping and accounting work
 in niyamon ko kuch anya praayogic tareeke se bhi yaad rakh kar upyog main aasaani se laayaa ja saktaa he
 For this, it is necessary to first identify the nature of the transaction or transaction and separate the two forms
 saamanytah 90 pratishat saude nagad lenden se sambandhit hote he
 It is therefore clear that they will have one form or party in cash, since the cash is a real account, if the cash is being received, the cash account debit and its other party whether personal, real or unreal can be credited without consideration and if the cash If going, the cash account will be debited and whatever the other party is
 isi prakaar kharchon evam aay ko bhi saralata se pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, all types of proceeds will be debited and whatever will be credited to the other party, if one party is related to income or profit, then it will be debited to the credit and the party
 saath hi jo bhi vastu yaa sampatti kharidi jaati he to use debit karegein evam bechi jaati to use credit karenge evam uske viruddh paksh ko davit yaa credit karenge
 a detailed description of examples and rules of debit / credit is as follows: - vyay khate main, evam sampattiyaan tulan patr main Following are the major parts of double accounting system
 inhen 'doharaa lekha pranali kii seedhiyaan' yaa 'lekhakarm kaa dhaancha' bhi kaha jaataa he
 The account of the beneficiary party is called the creditor and the account of the party who receives it is called the debtor
 saamaanya rup se khate dwaara praapt laabh kii keemat ko khate main vam stambh main likhaa jaataa he or yah kaha jaataa he ki khate kii utani keemat se debit kiya gaya

 Initially, the divided Karakhanis were also able to compete with the Saljuks and for some time they were able to occupy some cities in the Khorasan area of the Saljuks
 lekin san 1089 main salajukon ne samarqnd par qabza kar liya
 Western prisoners accepted subjugation of turnips
 kuch samay baad purvi karakhaani bhi unke adheen ho gaye
 When the Jurchen people attacked the Liao dynasty of the settled settlers in northern China, away from Central Asia in 1125, the Khitans traveled westward and came into Qarakhani areas under Saljuq
 unhone pashchimi karakhaaniyon ko khujand main haraa diya or 1141 main kaara-kitaan khaanat yahan kaa pramukh samrajya ho gai
 The kara-khitanis believed in Buddhism and the Ojha system, while the Karakhanis were Muslim, yet the Kara-khites were secular so they let the princely princely states under them

 buudhvaar ko kisi bhi shubh kaary ke liye yatra nahin karte
 'but Madhusudan did not agree
 usne aisi shubh-ashubh kii baton ko na maanane kii baat kahi
 Both started the journey by bullock cart
 do kos kii yatra ke baad uski gaadi kaa ek pahiyaa tut gaya
 From there both started the journey on foot
 raste main sangeeta ko pyaas lagi
 Madhusudan sat him under a tree and went to get water

 Sangeeta too was surprised to see Madhusudan
 vah donon main koi antar nahin kar pai
 Madhusudan asked the person- 'who are you and why are you sitting near my wife?' Hearing Madhusudan, the man said- 'hey brother, this is my wife Sangeeta
 main apni patni ko sasuraal se vidaa kara kar laayaa hoon
 But who are you asking me such a question? ' madhusudan ne lagbhag cheekhte hue kaha- 'tum jarur koi chor yaa thag ho
 This is my wife Sangeeta
 main ise ped ke neeche baitaakar jal lene gaya tha
 The person said - 'hey brother! You are telling lies
 sangeeta ko pyaas lagane par jal lene to main gaya tha
 i have also given water to my wife and given her drink

 Then there was the AIR - 'madhusudan! You did not listen to Sangeeta's parents and left her in-laws on Wednesday
 yah sab bhagwaan budhdev ke prakope se ho rahaa he
 ' madhusudan ne bhagwaan budhdev se prarthana kii ki 'he bhagwaan budhdev mujhe kshamaa kar dijie
 i made a big mistake
 bhavishya main ab kabhi buudhvaar ke din yatra nahin karunga or sadaiv buudhvaar ko aapkaa vrath kiya karunga
 ' madhusudan ke prarthana karne se bhagwaan budhdev ne use kshamaa kar diya
 Then the other person disappeared from the king
 raja or duusare log is chamatkaar ko dekh hairaan ho gaye
 With this kindness of Lord Budhdev, the king sent away Madhusudan and his wife respectfully
 kuch dur chalane par raste main unhen baiylgaadee mil gai
 The broken wheel of the bullock cart was also attached
 donon usamen baithkar samtapur kii ore chal die
 Both Madhusudan and his wife Sangeetha began to live happily while fasting on Wednesday

 Practicality developed partly due to the popularity of laboratory-based animal experiments, and partly due to Freud's psychodynamic response, which was originally difficult to test because, among other reasons, it relied on case studies and clinical experiences Tended to act and deal with large-scale interpersonal phenomena, which should be calculated quantitatively or It was a difficult task to define

 udaasiyon ke akhaadon athwa sampradaay kii vividh shakhaon ko bhi praaia: 'dhuni' vaa 'dhuvaan' kaa naam diya jaataa he
 It is also famous among its followers that in its center located in Kabul, there is still such a smoke that was ignited by Shrichandra himself

 Many other sects have had minimal influence over the followers of this sect by getting time and they also seem to be attracted towards certain reforms

 film kii duusari sikval sinistar 2 kii bhi aadhikarik ghoshnaa qi gai he or philhal 12 agast 2015 tak relies kii shedyul kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 The film begins with a film pulled from an old Super 8 camcoder where four people are standing in a loop, the other end of the loop is tied to the second branch, the same piece is cut mysteriously by the weight of those four people
 The snares are pulled up tightly
 kai maah baad usee ghar par krim rieter ellison oswalt apni nai kitaab likhane ke liye apane parivaar saath shift hota he, uske saath uski wif traisi or do bachche, 7 saal kii eshli jise deevaaron par art-painting karne kaa shauk he or 12 saal kaa trevor 
 haalaanki vahaan kaa local sheriff use yahaan se shift na hone kii hidaayat detaa he, ellison ko pataa he is ghar main ek katl kii vaardaat hui he or is maamle par padtaal ke baad wo yahaan se chale jaaenge
 During the investigation of the house, Allison finds a box from the roof attic room, but while removing the box, there is a big scorpion which he kills
 ellison apni kitaab is katl e vaardaat par isliye bhi likhnaa chahta he kyonki us katl ke baad parivaar kii aakhri 10 saal kii ladki steffni rahasyamay dhang segumshuda he
 Here, a home projector from the box found in the house and the reel case of the 8mm standard film Negative, Allison was beginning to see all the minor domestic home-movies, finally she is witness to the dreadful end of the family
 jaise pool main bandhi haalat main parivaar kii dubkar maut, puure parivaar kii band car main lagi aag se jinda jalanaa, barsaat kii raat main laan removal se ghaas kaatane kii jagah jinda log ko kaatna, der raat puure parivaar ko gahari neend main khanjar se jibah karnaa or aakhri film jahaan ek darkht par chaar logon ko faansee par latakaaya gaya he
 Alison is heartbroken to see this ruthless murder, here she then finds another mysterious person in the pool party movie and also a strange mark, and this is seen in every previous film as well
 He takes out photo printouts of all these one by one
 isi darmyaan lit cat jaati he or kuch aahat sunai padati he jo chat kii atic rum se aa rahi hoti he, apane diji cam kii flash kii madad se jab ellison vahaan pahunchataa he to vahaan use projector baks kaa dhakkan sarakate hue paata he, chad se hataane par usase ek karait saanp rengta hua nikal jaataa he
 Looking at the lid here, he gets an exact sketch of the same slaughtered family, Allison takes pictures of all of them, as well as a sketch of the same man
 Shown by the name of Bugiman
 ellison philhal atic rum se nikalne hi vaala tha ki vahaan kaa farsh tut jaataa he, kisi tarah latakane ke baavjood vah buree tarah girtaa he or pairon par chot aati he
 The next morning, with medical attention, the police also arrive there to find Tafriah, showing local deputy Swinsky interested in investigating the murder by Allison, in return for which Allison asks for a bio-data of all the dead families and the case files related to them
 cese kii study se yahi maaloom hota he ki sabhi parivaar alag-alag tarikhon or shahar main hui, samanta sirf harek parivaar kii maut ke baad ek bachche kaa rahasyamay dhang se gaayab hona
 maut se pehle parivaar ke sadsy ko kisi kism kaa nasha karana taaki katl ke samay ve sangharsh na kar paaen
 And the presence of a mysterious person in every film and the finding of a demonic mark
 The deputy then also advises Ellison to talk to Professor Jonas of the local university, who often helps the police in such mysterious and intriguing cases, to understand the issue
 shaam ko ellison laan work '86 kii film dekhne par katl vaale drishy dekh dahal jate he, khud ko shant karne baad online chat par professor jonas se yah malumat hote jis mi
 bugiman or film main darshaae nishaan madhyakaalin yug ke bughuul se sambandhit he jo vibhinn tareekon se parivaar kii hatya karata he or ek bachche ko vaastavik duniya se apni mayavi duniya main apana gulam banane ko le jaataa he
 Although according to the professor this is just a story, Alison also considers it a coincidence
 phir apni offis band karke ellison sone chal detaa subah 3 baje aas-paas projector chalane kii aawaaj sun chaunk padataa he, lekin offis pahunchne par vahaan koi dikhataa nahi, anjaane dar se vah besabaal kalb lekar kamaron kaa muyayana karata he, or usee ke peeth peeche unheen gumshuda bacchon ke saae najaron main aae bagaiyr luccatipi karte he
 He also goes to Ashlee's room, where he closes the door with a look, but Ashley's eyes were on Stephanie, who was sitting in front of the wall with the same picture, which had people hanging on the family's court, including Bughoul
 thakaa hua ellison sofe par hi besabaal-club pakade baithe-baithe so jaataa he, agali soobah hone tak wo jaagta he
 Upon waking up, Alison then goes to the office cabin, where the film and projector are lying as she is, and later narrates the night's experiences to Deputy Siewinski, the deputy advising her to avoid dominating her life
 udhar traisi se ellison ko eshli kii shikaayat aati he ki wo room ke baahar tasviir bana rahi he, lekin eshli ke mutabik yah sab usee steffni ne banaaya he jis ellison apni kitaab likh rahaa he
 Later, Tracy's patience is broken, according to which the house where Alison is writing the book of murder, now her own family is in danger
 yahaan ellison bhi apana tark detaa he ki wo usne sirf apane parivaar ke khatir is sachai chhupaai thi, use iske asar kaa jaraa sa bhaan na tha, or bina apni kitaab puri kiye wo yahaan se ja nahin ja saktaa
 is bahes or tark main lagbhag donon tut jate he
 The two reconcile in the late evening to realize their mistake, and Alison wakes up in the same night, Alison wakes up to the sound of the projector, chasing the sound he finds in the office, on the way to the attic room, to the terrace
 The staircase was open, on which Alison was surprised to see the film going on the projector sitting on the five missing children sitting on the projector, all the children looking at it and looking silent Rae, the creepy Bughuul seen in the film, suddenly appears in front of her face when Alison falls down the stairs screaming in fear, the projector from the ceiling and the movie Mee is hit on the floor
 ellison un sabhi chizon ko bakeyard main jala daalata he, phir traisi or donon bacchon ko saath lekar apane pichley ghar lautne kaa faisla letaa he
 While patrolling along the way, Sheriff stops following Alison and sees him driving fast, Allison says that he is returning to his old home and is currently not writing a book, then the sergeant gives Alison further instructions
 Lets grow
 agali subah tak ellison apane puraane ghar par sara saamaan shift kara letaa he, shaam ko ellison laptaap par professor kii mail kiye gaye bughuul se sambandhit tasviren dekhtaa he, jinhen dekh pichhali ghatnaayen yaad aane lagati, online professor se baat karne par maaloom hua, jo wo tasviren dekh rahaa he vah bughuul kii sultanate or is vaastavik duniya ke aane-jane kaa jariya he, adhikansh tasviren purv isaayiyon ne manhus qaraar kar nasht kar diya taaki koi agali vaardaat na ho
 Alison also now seems to have got rid of the trouble by burning the projector and the film, then he deletes all the other recorded films
 phir atic room taraf saamaan rakhane dauraan ellison kii hairaani kii thikaana nahin rahata jab use dobaaraa se vahi projector vaala baks paata or is baar uske haath kuch or ekstended film kii andig clip reel milti he
 While adding the ends of the last films of those extended cut endings, the call of Deputy Siewanski is also received by Alison only after the complete assembly of that film
 dipti kii mili jaankaree ke mutabik usne in silecelewar vaardaat kii kadi malumaat kii he, unke anusaar yah harek parivaar usee ghar main rahaa karte the jahaan gat parivaar kii katl kii vaardaat hui thi, or unke ghar badalane ke agle roj unki maut hoti he; jaise steevence family ke aane se pehle ve saint
 louis ke ghar par rahaa karte the jahaan millar family kii jibah kar katl hua tha, to millar family pehle dilasio ke ghar rahaa karte the jahaan dilasio family ke log laan main maare gaye, phir dilasio family to pehle secromento ke ghar par rahete the jahaan martin kii family ko unke hi gairaaj main khadi gaadi main jinda jala diya gaya or martin us pehle ghar main rahaa karti thi jahaan us shuruyaat family kii logon ke pul par dubne se maut hui thi or lagbhag ellison bhi apana thikaana badalakar usee vaardaat kii timeline main aa chukaa he, andeshaa he ki aglaa shikaar ab wo log ho sakate he
 The deputy warns him that the murderer may be around his house so be careful
 dipti kii kaal rakh ellison un sabhi footage ko dekhtaa he ki abhi tak ke sabhi parivaar ke katl ke jimmevaar vahi laapata bachche hi the, jo shaayad bughuul ke vasheebhoot hokar apana kaam ko anjaam dekar uske saamne hi gaayab ho rahe the
 Alison now takes another step and feels her head twitching, then she finds a note paper under her coffee cup that says 'goodnight Daddy' and then Alison collapses
 yahaan eshli usee ke peeche maujuudagi se jaahir hota he ki usee ne nasha diya he, vaise hi jaise steffni ne bughuul ke adheen hokar kiya tha
 Alison finds herself, her wife Tracy, and son Trevor tied hand and foot when they become aware, where everyone has tape stuck in their mouths
 yahaan eshli apane saath kulhadi or usee 8 mm camere ke saath ellison par jhukati hui vaada dilaati he ki vah use dubaara mashhoor kar degi
 agle drishy main ghar kii sabhi diwaron or daravaaje par kun se bani kute-billiyon, unicorn or pichhali vaardaat kii tasviren milti he
 And Ashley Khun draws a sketch of her family on the same box cover from the sketch in the hands where she had cut all three with an ax
 saamne chal rahi haal hi kii bani film main wo sabhi gumshuda bacchon kaa gut saamne aata he, jahaan eshli ke kaam hone baad bughuul ke dikhte hi bachche chupane bhaag jate he or bughuul apni god main eshli ko bithakar chalati film main hi gaayab ho jaataa he
 The projector box, placed in the Attic room of the Oswalt family's house, now shows another Ashley-related film with 'house painting' 12 'written on the label, and finally the film ends after bullying Bughoul

 On the contrary, some say that Tatar was actually the name of a prince of Turkish race, whose brother was named Mongol
