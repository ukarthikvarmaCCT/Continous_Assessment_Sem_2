 a positive electron is a fundamental particle found in an atom
 yah dhan aavesh yukt electron he
 Its properties are similar to electrons, but the difference between the two is that electron is negatively charged particle and positron is positive charged particle

 When the positron and electron collide, both are destroyed and two gamma ray photons are generated
 chikitsaalay main upyog hone vaale eks kiran main neutron, gamma kiran, protone, nutrino, ke saath positron bhi shaamil rahata he
 Positron's experimental invention occurred in 1932 AD
 andersan ne dekha ki wilson abhrakoshth main chumbakeey kshetra lagaakar yadi antariksh kirnon ke photo len, to praaia: electron jaise do path drushti main aate hai, jinaki vakrata ulti dishaao main hoti he
 The curvature depends on the charge of the particle

 Now the existence of positron has also been established by other tests
 pozitron ke prayogtmak avishkaar se chaar varsh pehle dirack ne ek sameekaran diya tha, jisase electron ke sab gyaat gundharmon kaa varnan ho jaataa tha, kintu saath hi iske anusaar ek aise kan kaa maananaa bhi anivaary tha jisaki sanhati or urja rinatmak hon
 This thing was strange
 is avaanchhneeya sthiti se bachane ke liye dirack ne prastaav rakhaa ki saadharantaya rinatmak urja kii sab avasthaaen electronon se bhari rahati hai
 Therefore, we can see only the states of positive energy
 par kabhi kabhi jab vidyutchchumbakeey kshetra dwaara prabal, paraspar kriyaayein hoti hai tab rinatmak urja kii avasthaaon main se ek electron baahar nikal aata he tathaa baahar aakar aise vyavhaar karata he jaise dhan urja electron karte hai
 But at the same time a state with negative energy becomes empty
 ise ham rin urja ke samudr main ek chhidr se chitrit kar sakate hai
 This hole behaves in the same way as a positively charged particle, which is equivalent to an electron
 pahile dirack ne is kan ko proton maanane kaa praytn kiya, par andersan ke parinaam kaa pataa chalane par unhone is kan ko proton nahin, parantu pozitron mana
 Dirac's perforation theory is not very satisfactory
 electron or pozitron kaa aadhunik siddhant dirack sameekaran ke dwitiya quanteekaran par nirbhar he
 The properties of positron are derived from the natural method
 electron or pozitron ko 'kan' or 'pratikan' kah sakate hai
 This ideology has proved extremely useful in physics

 Common values of soil resistivity are- The Wenner four-pin method, as shown in figure above, is the most commonly used technique for soil resistivity measurements
using the Wenner method, the apparent soil resistivity value is: where ρe = measured apparent soil resistivity a = electrode spacing b = depth of the electrodes RW = Wenner resistance measured as "V / I" in Figure If b is small compared to a, as is the case of probes penetrating the ground only for a short distance, the previous equation can be reduced to: In the Schlumberger method the distance between the voltages probe is a and the distances from voltages probe and currents probe are c 
 Using the Schlumberger method, if b is small compared to a and c, and c> 2a, the apparent soil resistivity value is: where ρe = measured apparent soil resistivity a = electrode spacing b = depth of the electrodes c = electrode spacing RS = Schlumberger resistance measured as "V / I" in Figure raai bareli express 4208 bhartiya rail dwaara sanchalit ek mail express train he

 Sant Kanwar Ramji was born on 13 April 1885, on Baisakhi in Jarwar village of Mirpur Mathelo tehsil of Sakkhar district in Sindh province
 unke pita tarachand or mata tirth bai donon hi prabhu bhakthi evam hari kirthan karke santosh or saadagi se apana jivan vyateet karte the
 Tarachand used to run a small shop for supply
 unke jivan main santan kaa abhaav tha
 Mata Tirtha Bai used to serve at the heart of Khotram Sahib, the saint of Sindh
 sant ke aashirwad se unhen ek putr ratna kii prapti hui jiskaa naam 'kanvar' rakhaa gaya
 Kanwar means 'kanwal' meaning lotus flower
 namakaran ke samay sant khotaaraam sahib ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki jis prakaar camel kaa phool talab ke pani or keechad main khilakar damakata rahata he vaise hi is jagat main 'kanvar' bhi nirmal, virakt hoga or saare vishwa ko kartavya path, karm, tyaag or balidaan kaa maarg dikhayega
 Saint Kanwar Ramji was interested in devotion and bhajan kirtan from childhood
 unke madhur swar kii gunj gaanv ke aas-paas har jagah faili hui thi
 His mother used to boil gram and sell it to him
 vah apane madhur swar se gaate, awaz lagaate hue chane bechaa karte the
 In the village of Jarwar, Kirtan was being held in the evening of Saint Satram Dasji, the son of the great saint Khotram Sahib of Sindh
 usee samay chane bechney ke liye madhur sureeli or buland awaz main kishor kanvar ne dhwani sant ke kaano tak gai
 Chana is called 'kohar' in Sindhi language
 kohar kaa arth aisa hi samajha ja saktaa he ki koi mere paapon ko har le shant kare
 Sant Satram Dasji called the melodious Kishore Kanwar through the service and urged him to sing again in a loud and melodious voice
 unke sureele suron kii madhurata or anrtbhav ne sant hriday ko mohit kar diya
 Saint Satram Dasji took all his gram and distributed it in Sangat and Kanwar did not even take the money for the price of Kohar and put the entire Kohar at his feet
 santaji ke aashirwad kii anek dharaaen nikal padin
 In the first meeting, Kanwar Ramji became the successor to the spiritual capital of Guru Maharaj

 His birth was also the result of blessings of saints
 balya or kishor jivan donon hi santon ke sang main vyateet hua
 Due to the influence of the personality of saints, they were always lost in divine contemplation
 bhai tarachand ko apane putr kaa gumsum rahanaa nahin bhaayaa
 They attended the court of Rahkari with him
 vahaan sant satraam das sahib bhi kohar bechney vaale is adbhut balak kii maanon vyakulata se pratiksha kar rahe the
 After the formal request, Bhai Tarachand also informed about the blessing of the birth of this child by Saint Khotram Sahib
 divyata kaa aakarshan ek taraf nahin hota apitu dono ore se hota he
 While Kanwar Rama was anxious to go to the service of Sant Sattram Das Sahib, Sant Sathram Das Sahib was also looking forward to getting qualified disciples
 guru kii adhar-sudhaa se abhisinchit vaani jab gambhirtha se prasphutit hui, kanvar ram sahib kaa hriday camel khil uthaa
 He was accepted in the famous court of Raharki
 unke pita bhai tarachand to atyant harsh se kanth ke avaruddha ho jane ke kaaran keval naman maatr hi kar sake
 Not a single word came out of his mouth
 harsh tha putr ke sweekaare jane kaa to malaal tha putr ratna se bichhudane kaa
 Filled with both emotions, he returned from his true sage and returned home
 mridubhashi sant kanvar ram main kabhi abhimaan, katutaa, chal-kapat yaa lobh janm na le sakaa
 He received singing education from the musician Hasaramji
 apane guru sant satraam das sahib kii seva main rahakar ve bade gyani dhyani ban gaye
 Due to his virtues, he made Kanwar Ramji proficient in singing, dancing and music
 ve apane guru ke saath jagah-jagah paramparaagat 'bhagati' kaarykram prastut karte rahe
 After the success of Guru Sattaram Dasji, all his weight fell on the shoulders of Sant Kanwar Ramji
 sir par pagadi, tan par jama pahanakar or pairon main ghunghru baandhakar sant kanvar ram gaanv-gaanv jaakar 'bhagati' ke madhyam se ishawandana, prabhu bhakthi, aadhyatmik, naitik or maanviya aadarshon or sampradayik sadbhaav kaa prachaar karte the
 Santji was colloquially simple and simple, he wore white khadi dhoti, kurta, skirts on the shoulders, round caps or turban on the head, Jaisalmeri juti in the feet
 kirthan ke samay unke pahanaave kii jhalak sant tukaraam, namdev main dekhi ja sakati he or gayan ke samay prabhu bhakthi main leen hokar nrity karte rahanaa shraddhaluon ko chaitanya mahaprabhu kaa sajiv darshan karaata tha
 The divine Kanchan Kaya of Sant Kanwar Ramji had unique charm power
 hriday main madhurata kaa jharnaa tha
 Sweet and gentle words used to come from the mouth
 unki awaz main atyadhik mithaas thi, unke kalam, bhajan main aisi taasir thi ki sant kanvarram sahib kii bhagati kii jaankaree milte hi hazaron kii taadaad main aas-paas ke gaanvon ke hindu-musalmaan ekatra ho jaaya karte the
 He often sang in Amrita Vela and for two hours of the day his bhajan used to go on with the same calmness
 dur-dur se aae hue log unke madhur gayan kaa anand lete the, unke gayan main zyada hissaa sufi kalaamon kaa hota tha
 He used to sing as a preacher to spread the message of Sindhi Sufi culture to the masses, not only to the people
 unamem swayan ko jaanane pahchaanane kaa gyaan, nishkapat prem or naitikta samaai hui thi
 Once Mahatma Gandhi came to visit in Sakhar district of Sindh
 ve vahaan pehali baar aae the
 Therefore, the people there were sitting in panic in lakhs to listen to their darshan and speech
 pair rakhane ke liye tilbhar bhi sthaan nahin tha
 There was a lot of uproar
 sabhi manch par upasthit netaa anek praytn karke haar gaye par kolahal shant nahin hua
 The leaders sitting on the platform looked towards Sant Kanwar Ramji and after taking orders from Mahatma Gandhi, requested that if you calm this clamor, then Bapu's speech can be started
 sant kanvar ram sahib ne jaise hi mike par aakar lok prasiddh kanth se aalaap lagaaya ki sara vaataavaran shant ho gaya
 Then Gandhiji also deeply appreciated this dear devotee
 is mahapurush ke prayaso se bharat ke santon or sufiyon kii amarvani sindh ke shahar-shahar, gaanv-gaanv or ghar-ghar gunji
 He recites Kabir, Meera, Surdas, Guru Nanak, Sheikh Farid, Bulleshah, Abdul Latif, Sami, Sachal Sarmast and recites the hymns and hymns of many great poets and dervishes of India and the stories of King Vikramaditya, King Harishchandra, Bhakta Dhruva and Bhakta Prahlada etc
 Used to sing in his sweet and tinkling voice
 aisa prathit hota tha maanon bhakthi sangeet kaa koi vishaal samagam ho rahaa ho
 He did not allow discrimination of religion, race and caste to come close to him
 unki buland awaz andhere or khamoshi ko chirati hui milon tak sunai detii thi
 His devotees used to understand that the sage of Sant Kanwar Ram is organized in a nearby village
 unhone bhagati ke kaarykram ke madhyam se satya, ahimsa, sampradayik sauhaard, vishwabandhutav, ishawandana, maanviya prem, samta or naitik aacharan kaa sandesh aam or khaas tak pahunchaaya
 Saint Kanwar Rama was the epitome of renunciation and penance, the sage who knew the heart of life, the ocean of mercy, the messiah of the oppressed, the ghetto and the disabled
 jahaan unke mukh mandal par kisi rishi sa tej jhalkata tha vahiin unke netron se nur barasata tha
 Human service was his main objective
 apango, netra hinon, rogiyon evam kusht-rogiyon kii seva apane haathon se karke ve swayan ko dhanya maanate the
 Sant Kanwar Ram Sahib's name comes at the highest position in the field of service
 unke paropkaaree evam aadhyatmik jivan ne maanav ke sanskaro main kalyaan, sarv dharm sambhaav, paroapkaar evam maanav aadarshon ko nai disha pradaan kii he
 Many incidents happened in the life of Santji in forty years of amazing Guru Bhakti
 shikarpur ke shahi baag main prabhaat ke samay ek mahila ne apane mrit navjaat shishu ko sant kii jholii main lori ke liye diya
 The child is dead, everyone except his mother was unaware, Saint Kanwar Ramji worshiped the Lord in a heartfelt manner and sang a lullaby
 santaji kii god main baccha rone laga
 Seeing this miracle, the woman fell at the feet of the saint and wept bitterly
 usne balak ke mrit hone kii baat sari sangat ko sunai
 The sangat present there was stunned

 Journalism is a major occupation of modern civilization, which includes the collection, writing, gathering and editing of news, editing and proper presentation
 aaj ke yug main patrakarita ke bhi anek madhyam ho gayi hai; jaise - akhbaar, patrikayen, radio, doordarshan, web-patrakarita aadi
 With the changing times, the interrelationship of marketism and journalism brought about extensive changes in the content and presentation style of journalism

 Any democracy is strong only when journalism continues to play its meaningful role towards social concerns
 sarthak patrakarita kaa uddeshy hi yah hona chahie ki vah prashasan or samaaj ke bich ek mahatvapurn kadi kii bhoomika apanaaye
 Looking at the history of journalism, the main objective of journalism before independence was the goal of achieving independence
 swatantraaa ke liye chale andolan or swadhinata sangram main patrakarita ne ahm or sarthak bhoomika nibhaai
 At that time, journalism kept the entire nation united in the thread of unity, and kept the whole society connected with the goal of achieving freedom

 Today any information can be made available and made in a blink of an eye

 The widespread use of journalistic access and freedom of expression is usually associated with social concerns and well-being, but sometimes it is also being misused
 sanchaar kranti tathaa soochna ke aadhikaar ke alaava aarthik udaarikaran ne patrakarita ke chehre ko puri tarah badalakar rakh diya he
 The huge amount of revenue earned from advertisements has made journalism quite commercial
 media kaa lakshya aaj aadhik se aadhik kamai kaa ho chalaa he
 The result of this commercial approach of media is that its attention has deviated from social concerns
 muddon par aadhaarit patrakarita ke bajaay aaj incotement hi media kii surkhiyon main rahata he
 The widespread and widespread public access to the Internet has also led to its misuse
 internet ke upyogkarta nijee bhadaas nikaalane or atanrgatattha aapattijanak pralaap karne ke liye is upyogi saadhan kaa galat istemaal karne lage hai
 This is the reason why the debate of curbing these multi-purpose tools of the media is also occasionally

 If a man is a journalist, then it is his endeavor to reveal such deep things or truth which is imprisoned in the depths of mystery
 sach kii tah tak jaakar use sataha par laane yaa ujagar karne ko hi ham anveshi yaa khoji patrakarita kehete hai
 Investigative journalism is another form of espionage in which there is a lot of risk

 In this, each fact and links have to be linked with each other, then the desired goal is achieved somewhere

 Bhupalapatnam is a village in Adilabadu district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India, in Sirpur Pattanam division
 kamayani hindi bhashaa kaa ek mahakavy he
 Its author is Jaishankar Prasad
 yah aadhunik chhayavaadi yug kaa sarvottam or pratinidhi hindi mahakavy he
 This last poetic composition of 'prasad' was published in 1936 AD, but its practice had started about 7-8 years ago
 'chintaa' se prarambh kar 'anand' tak 15 sargon ke is mahakavy main maanav man kii vividh antarvrittiyon kaa kramik unmilan is kaushal se kiya gaya he ki maanav sristi ke aadi se ab tak ke jivan ke manovaigyanik or saanskrithik vikaas kaa itihaas bhi spasht ho jaataa he
 From the point of view of art, Kamayani can be considered the best symbol of cinematic poetry
 chittavritiyon kaa kathanak ke paatr ke rup main avataran is kavy kii anyatam visheshta he
 And from this point of view, the descent of beauty, beauty, devotion and Ida into human form is the unique fund of Hindi literature
 kamayani pratybhigna darshan par aadhaarit he
 Along with this, the influence of Arvind philosophy and Gandhi philosophy is also found here
 maanav ke agrajanma dev nishcint jati ke jeev the
 Due to not having any kind of concern, he used to live in the 'chir-kishore-vay' and 'nityavilasi' Dev's self-mars-worship
 prakruti yah atichaar sahan na kar saki or usne apana pratishodh liya
 The fierce flooding resulted in the destruction of Devasruti, with only Manu surviving
 devsrushti ke vidhwans par jis maanav jati kaa vikaas hua uske mul main thi 'chintaa', jiske kaaran vah jaraa or mrityu kaa anubhav karne ko baadhya hui
 In addition to the anxiety, Manu was also struggling with divine and devilish practices, due to which there was the emergence of hope, reverence, shame and Eda on the one hand, and on the other hand, a feeling of sex, jealousy and struggle would also arise
 in virdohi vrittiyon ke nirantar ghaat-pratighaat se manu main nirved jagaa or shraddha ke pathpradarshan se yahi nirved kramash: darshan or rahasy kaa gyaan praapt kar ant main aannad kii uplabdhi kaa kaaran bana
 It is the sequence of human psychological development from anxiety to pleasure
 saath hi maanav ke akhetak rup main prarambh kar shraddha ke prabhaav se pashupaalan, krishak jivan or ida ke sahyog se saamaajik or audyogic kranti ke rup main bhautik vikaas evam ant main aadhyatmik shanti kii prapti kaa udyog maanav ke saanskrithik vikaas ke vividh sopan hai
 Thus Kamayani is the story of the emergence and development of mankind
 prasad ne is kavy ke pradhan paatr 'manu' or kamputree kamayani 'shraddha' ko aitihaasik vyakti ke rup main mana he, saath hi jalplavan kii ghatana ko bhi ek aitihaasik tathy sweekaar kiya he
 Prasad has composed the plot of this poem by compiling the references to water-burning from the eighth chapter of the first episode of Shatapatha Brahmana, as well as the metaphor of Manu and Shraddha given in the Upanishads and Puranas, he did not reject it, but the plot
 He was given such a form in which the association of Manu, Shraddha and Ida's metaphor fits well
 parantu sookshm sristi se dekhne par jaan padataa he ki in charitron ke roopak kaa nirvaah hi adhik sundar or susanyat rup main hua, aitihaasik vyakti ke rup main ve purnat: ekangi or vyaktitwaheen ho gaye hai
 Manu is just as volatile as Mana
 pehle shraddha kii prerana se ve tapasvi jivan tyaag kar prem or pranay kaa maarg grahan karte hai, phir asur purohit akuli or kilaat ke bahekaave main aakar hinsavriti or swechhacharan ke vasheebhoot ho shraddha kaa sukh-saadhan-nivas chhod jhanjha samir kii bhanti bhatakate hue saraswat pradesh main pahonchte hai; shraddha ke prati manu ke durvyavhaar se kshubdh kaam kaa abhishaap sun hataash ho kinkartavyavimudh ho jate hai or ida ke sansarg se buddhi kii sharan main ja bhautik vikaas kaa maarg apanaate hai
 There too, due to lack of restraint, they persecute Eda and they struggle with the subjects
 is sangharsh main parajeet or prakruti ke rudra prakope se vikshubdh manu jivan se virakt ho palaayan kar jate hai or ant main shraddha ke pathpradarshan main uskaa anusaran karte hue aadhyatmik anand praapt karte hai
 Thus, in this poem, a beautiful analysis of the effect of reverence - theistic sense - and Eda - intellectual capacity - on Manu's mind
 kamayani 15 sarg kaa mahakavy he
 These cantos are as follows: sutara :- chintaa kii aashaa se shraddha ne kaam vaasana ko lajjit kiya
 Eda struggled in a dream, jealous of Karma
 nidara From the point of view of poetic form, Kamayani is contemplative, in which the poet has given a great message to human
 'tap nahin, keval jeevansatya' ke rup main kavi ne maanav jivan main prem kii mahatta ghoshit kii he
 This world is Kalyanbhoomi, this is the basic establishment of faith
 is kalyanbhumi main prem hi ekmaatr shrey or prey he
 Kamayani has been incarnated to convey this love
 prem maanav or keval maanav kii vibhuti he
 Non-human beings, whether they are eternal gods, whether devas, demons and demons are worshiped in the worship of gods and souls, whether they are animals, they do not know the art and glory of love, love has been reputed by humans only
 parantu is prem main samrasya kii aavashyaktaa he
 In the absence of harmony, this love takes the form of disorderly courtship
 manu ke jivan main is samrasya ke abhaav ke kaaran hi maanav praja ko kaam kaa abhishaap sahanaa pad rahaa he
 Discrimination, high-pitched tendency, hypocrisy and conceit of arrogance all arise from the lack of this harmony which makes life miserable and cursed
 kamayani main isi kaaran samarasata kaa aagrah he
 This harmony brings harmony in the sense of duality
 sansar main dwandvon kaa udgam shaashvat tatv he
 The thorn with the flower, the lack with emotion, the grief with happiness, and the day with the night is always on
 maanav inamen apni ruchi ke anusaar ek ko chun letaa he, duusare ko chhod detaa he or yahi uske vishaad kaa kaaran he
 It is necessary for a human to accept both, leaving one or the other does not work
 yahi dwandvon kii samanvay sthiti hi samrasya he
 Prasad emphasizes the coordination of heart and brain, devotion and wisdom, tenacity, self-control and love, love, desire, knowledge and action
 kamayani ek pratikatmak kavy he jisamen shamanu,shraddha,ida,kilaat-akuli,shwet vrishabh aadi kramshah man, buddhi,maanav,asuri bhav,dharm ke pratik hai
