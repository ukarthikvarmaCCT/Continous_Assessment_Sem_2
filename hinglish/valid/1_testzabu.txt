 vah likhte hai: "quran saboot ke bina anumaan lagane ke khatre par dhyaan khinchataa he gyaan nahin kiya he 


 17:36) or kai alag-alag chhandon main musalamaanon se poochta he pramaanon kii aavashyaktaa ke liye, to saboot kii aavashyaktaa he, donon dharmik vishwaas or prakritik vigyaan main

 Ziauddin Sardar made a case for Muslims to develop the foundations of modern science in order to pay attention and reflect on the natural phenomena that the Quran repeatedly calls for
 bhautik vigyaani abdus salaam ne apane nobel puraskaar bhoj pate main quran kii ek prasiddh kavita uddhrut kii or phir kaha: "yah prabhaav sabhi bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he: jitna gaharaa ham chaahate hai, utana hi adhik hamaare aashcharya utsahit, hamaare nazar kaa chamak he "
 One of Salam's core beliefs was that there is no contradiction between Islam and discoveries that science tells humanity about nature and the universe
 salaam ne yah bhi raay rakhi ki quran or adhyayan or tarksangat pratibimb kii islamic bhaavana asaadhaaran sabhyataa ke vikaas kaa strot thi
 Salaam, in particular, used Ibn al-haytham and al-biruni as pioneers of the empiricist who introduced the experimental approach, breaking with Aristotle's influence and thus giving rise to modern science

 The message of the Quran is conveyed with various literary structures and devices
 mul arabi main, surya or chand dhvanyatmak or vishaygat sanrachanaon ko niojit karte hai jo paath ke sandesh ko yaad karne ke liye darshakon ke prayaason main sahaayta karte hai
 Muslims insist that the content and style of the Quran are inappropriate
 quran kii bhashaa ko "kavita gadhy" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he kyonki yah kavita or gadhy donon kaa hissaa he; haalanki, yah vivaran kuranik bhashaa kii layaaddh gunvattta ko vyakt karne main vifal hone kaa jokhim chalaata he, jo kuch hisson main adhik kavy he or dusron main adhik gadhy jaisaa he
 The Quran, while found throughout the Quran, is typical of many earlier Mecca Suras, in which relatively few verses throw singing words into prominence
 is tarah ke rup kii prabhaavashiltaa udhaaharan ke liye sura 81 main spasht he, or isamen koi andeh nahin he ki in margon ne shrotaaon ke vivek ko prabhavit kiya
 a change of verse from one set of verses to another signal is often a change in the subject of discussion
 baad ke khand bhi is form ko sangrakshit karte hai lekin style adhik expogitary he
 The Quranic text has no beginning, middle or end, its nonlinear structure is similar to a web or net
 paathyacharya vyavastha ko kabhi-kabhi nirantarata kii kami, kisi bhi kalkram yaa vishaygat kram or doharaav kii anupasthiti ko pradarshit karne ke liye mana jaataa he

 Selling also addresses the recurrence of much discussion of the Quran, also seeing it as a literary device
 ek paath aatm-sanderbhit hota he jab yah swayan ke bare main bolta he or khud ko sanderbhit karata he
 According to Stephen Wilde, the Quran illustrates this metatextuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted
 un anuchhedon main aatm- refrencielity spasht he jahaan quran swayan ko ek aatmanirbhar tareeke se, samachar, maandand ke rup main swayan ko prakat karne ke rup main sanderbhit karata he
 There is a blessed remembrance that we sent down, so are you rejecting it now? "), Or in the frequent presence of the" say "tag, when Muhammad is ordered to speak
 junglee ke anusaar quran atyadhik aatm-sanderbhit he
 This feature is more pronounced in early Mecca Suras
 mukhya lekh: tafasir The Quran has sparked a vast body of commentary and interpretation intended to explain the meanings of Quranic verses, clarify their import, and unravel their significance
 tafaseer musalamaanon kii sabase shuruaati shaikshanik gatividhiyon main se ek he
 According to the Quran, Muhammad was the first person to describe the meanings of verses for early Muslims
 anya shuruaati nikaayon main mohammad ke kuch saathi shaamil the, jaise ' ali ebn abi talib ,' abdulla ebn abbaas, abdulla ebn umr or ubey ebn kaab 
 In those days exegesis was limited to the literary aspects of the poem, the background of its publication and, sometimes, the explanation of the interpretation of one poem with the help of another
 yadi kavita ek aitihaasik ghatana ke bare main thi, to kabhi-kabhi mohammad kii kuch paramparaon ko iskaa arth spasht karne ke liye varnit kiya gaya tha
 Since the Quran is spoken in classical Arabic, many of the latter did not convert to Islam, they did not always understand Quranic Arabic, they did not catch Muslims who were fluent in Arabic of Muslims and were concerned with settling subjects in the Quran
 Clear struggle of
 arabi main tippanee karne vaale tippaneekaron ne sanketon ko samajhaayaa, or shaayad sabase mahatvapurn baat yah samajhaayaa ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke karier main quran ke chhandon kaa khulaasa kiya gaya tha, jo ki sabase shuruaati muslim samudaay ke liye upyukt tha, or jise baad main prakat kiya gaya tha, radd karnaa yaa " nirast karnaa " nasakh ) pehle ke paath 
 However, other scholars say that there is no repeal in the Quran
 ahmadiya muslim samudaay ne quran par das khand vaali urdu tippanee prakashit kii he, jiskaa naam tafaseer i kabir he 
 The esoteric interpretation or Sufi interpretation attempts to unveil the inner meaning of the Quran
 sufiwaad chhandon ke spasht bindu se aage badhata he or iske bajaay quran ke chand ko aantarik yaa gudh or chetana or astitv ke aadhyatmik ayaamon se sambandhit karata he
 According to Sands, esoteric interpretations are more suggestive than declarative, they are indicative rather than explanatory
 ve sambhaavnaaon ko ingit karte hai jitna ki ve prayek lekhak kii antardrushti kaa pradarshan karte hai
 The Sufi interpretation, according to Annabel Keller, is also an example of the use of the subject of love, for example in the Qur'anic interpretation of the Quran
 quran 7: 143 kahata he: When Moses came at the time when we appointed, and his Allah spoke to him, he said, 'my Allah, show me yourself! let me see you!' He said, 'you won't see me, but look at that mountain, if it stays strong you will see me
 ' jab uske bhagwaan ne pahaad par khud ko prakat kiya, to usne ise kharaab kar diya
 Moses fainted
 jab vah thik ho gaya, usne kaha, 'jai ho! main tumse pashchaatap karata hoon! main vishwaas karne vaala pehla vyakti hum! In 7: 143 Moses, the way of those who are in love, comes asking for a vision but his will is denied, he is commanded to see other than the mountain, while the mountain is able to see God
 
 parvat par bhagwaan ke prakat hone kii drushti se parvat chur or musa behosh hojaate hai
 In the words of Kushayari, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and Moses of Moses had nothing left
 khud se unmoolan kii sthiti main, musa ko vaastaviktaaon kaa anaavaran diya gaya tha
 From a Sufi point of view, God always causes the will and suffering of the beloved and the wayfarer to realize the truth
 mohammad hossain taababatei kehete hai ki baad ke utthanon ke bich lokapriy spashtikaran ke anusaar, tavil kaa arth he ki ek kavita kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 The meaning of revelation, as opposed to Tawal, is clear according to the explicit meaning of the words, as they were told
 lekin yah spashtikaran itnaa vyapak ho gaya he ki, vartmaan main, yah tavil kaa praathmik arth ban gaya he, jiskaa mul rup se "vaapasi karne" yaa "vaapasi sthaan" kaa arth tha
 In Tabatai's view, what is called taiwil or hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran is not concerned with the signification of words
 iske bajaay, yah kuch sachai or vaastaviktaaon se sambandhit he jo purushon ke saamaanya bhaag kii samaj se pare he; phir bhi yah in satyon or vaastaviktaaon se he ki siddhant ke siddhant or quran ke vyaavhaarik nishedh jari hai
 Interpretation is not the meaning of the poem but it is transparent in a particular type of transit through that meaning
 ek aadhyatmik vaastaviktaa he- jo ek kanoon kaa paalan karne kaa mukhya uddeshy he, yaa divine gun kaa varnan karne kaa mul uddeshy he- or phir ek vaastavik mahatv he ki ek quran kii kahani kaa sandarbh he
 According to Shia beliefs, which are strongly rooted in knowledge such as Muhammad and Imams, know the mysteries of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, bayaan "koi bhi bhagwaan ko chhodkar isaki vyakhya ko jaanata he" kisi bhi virdohi yaa yogyata khand ke bina maanya rahata he
 Therefore, as far as this verse is concerned, knowledge of Quranic interpretation is reserved for God
 lekin Tabatabaei anya chhandon kaa upyog karata he or nishkarsh nikaala he ki jo log bhagwaan dwaara shuddh hai quran kii vyakhya kuch had tak pataa he
 According to Tabatai, there are esoteric interpretations that are acceptable and unacceptable
 sweekaarya ta'vil apane shabdic arth se pare ek kavita ke arth ko sanderbhit karata he; balki antarnihit arth, jo antat keval bhagwaan ke liye janaa jaataa he or akele maanav vichaaron ke madhyam se sidhe samajha nahin ja saktaa he
 The verses in question here refer to the human qualities of coming, going, sitting, contentment, anger, and sorrow, which are clearly attributed to God
 asweekaarya ta'wil vah he jahaan ek saboot ke madhyam se ek alag arth ke liye ek kavita kaa spasht arth "sthanantarit" hota he; yah vidhi spasht visangatiyon ke bina nahin he
 Although this unacceptable Ta'wil has gained considerable acceptance, it is incorrect and cannot be applied to Quranic verses
 sahi vyakhya yah he ki vaastaviktaa ek kavita ko sanderbhit karti he
 It is found in all verses, decisive and ambiguous alike; This is not the meaning of the word; It is a fact that it is too fantastic for words
 bhagwaan ne unhen apane dimag main thodaa sa laane ke liye shabdon ke saath taiyaar kiya he; is sambandh main ve kahaniyon kii tarah hai jinka upyog dimag main ek tasviir banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, or is prakaar shrota ko spasht rup se icchit vichaar ko samajhane main madad milti he
 One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation before the 12th century is Sulami whose work would not have been preserved without most of the early Sufi commentaries
 sulaami kii pramukh tippanee hekik al-tafaseer kii ek pustak he jo pehle sufi kii tippaniyon kaa sankalan he
 Several other works, including commentaries from Kushayari, Dayalam, Shirazi and Suhrawardy, emerged from the 11th century
 in kaaryon main sulaami kii kitabon or lekhak ke yogadan se saamagree shaamil he
 Many works have been written in Persian such as the works of Mabri Kashf al-asrar
 rumi ne apni pustak mathnavi main vishaal rahasyamay kavita likhi thi
 Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in the translation of Rumi's work
 mathnavi main badi sankhya main kuranik maarg paae ja sakate hai, jinamein se kuch quran kii ek sufi vyakhya par vichaar karte hai
 Rumi's book is not exceptional for quotations and elaborations on the Quran, however, Rumi mentions the Quran more often
 simnani ne quran par gudh exegesis ke do prabhaavshaalee kaaryon ko likhaa tha
 He reconciled the sentiments of Sunni Islam with the ideas and manifestations of God in the material world
 18 veen shatabdi main ismail haaki bursavi ke kaam jaise vyapak sufi tippaniyan dikhaai detii hai
 His work Ruh al-bayan is a huge marifat
 arabi main likhaa gaya he, yah lekhak ke apane vichaaron ko unke purvavartiyon ke saath jodta he
 Unlike the Salafis and Zahiri, the Shia and Sufis as well as some other Muslim philosophers believe that the meaning of the Quran is not limited to the literal aspect
 unke liye, yah ek aavashyak vichaar he ki quran main bhi aantarik pahalu hai
 Henry Corbin describes a hadith that goes back to Muhammad: quran main bahari upasthiti or ek chhipi gaharaai, ek asaadhaaran arth or ek gudh arth he
 This esoteric meaning in turn hides an esoteric meaning
 to yah saat gudh arthon ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 According to this view, it has also become clear that the internal meaning of the Quran does not eliminate or invalidate its external meaning
 iske bajaay, yah aatma kii tarah he, jo sharir ko jivan detaa he
 Corbin considers the Quran to play a role in Islamic philosophy, as nanology itself goes hand in hand with the prophet
 paath ke zahir se nipatane vaali tippaniyon ko tafaseer kaha jaataa he, or batin se nipatane vaali harmenetic or gudh tippaniyon ko tavil, jisamen paath ko isaki shuruyaat main waapas lenaa shaamil he
 Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God
 iske vipareet, kuranik shabdikta, iske baad salaphis or jahiris, yah vishwaas he ki quran ko keval iske spasht arth main hi liya janaa chahie
 The reenactment is the name of the hermeneutic style of some former Muslims who converted to Christianity
 unki style yaa punrariti vigyaapan or gaiyr-vyavasthit he or maafee maangane kii disha main taiyaar he
 This tradition of interpretation is based on the following practices: grammatical rethinking, curriculum preference, retrieval, and rethinking concession
 mukhya lekh: quran anuwadyah bhi dekhen: quran ke anuwaadon kii suchikuran kaa anuwaad hameshaa samasyagrast or kathin rahaa he
 Many argue that the Quranic text cannot be reproduced in any other language or form
 iske alaava, ek arabi shabd ke sandarbh ke aadhaar par kai arth ho sakate hai, sateek anuwaad ko or bhi kathin banaate hai
 Nevertheless, the Quran has been translated into most African, Asian and European languages

 In the 12th century, the Quran was translated into Persian by Najm al-din Abu Hafs al-nasafi

 It can be said that this discipline studies the rules and methods of proper recitation of the Quran and three main areas: proper pronunciation of consonants and vowels, rules of pause in recitation and restoration of recitation, and musical and melodic features of the text

 quran kii bhashaa thi samaan karne ke liye siriek bhashaa
 The Quran recounts the stories of many people and events heard in Jewish and Christian sacred books and devotional literature, although it differs in many details
 aadam, idris, nuh, abar, saleh, ibrahim, loot, ishmail, ishaq, yaqub, yousuf, ayyub, shoeb, daaud, sulaiman, eliyyah, elisha, younus, haaron, musa, zakaaria, yuhanna isa kaa ullekh quran main rasul ke or nabi ke rup main kiya gaya he 
 In fact, Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other person
 mohammad kii tulana main quran main isa kaa aksar ullekh kiya gaya he, jabaki mariyam kaa ullekh quran main kiya gaaya he or engil main nahin
 Some non-muslim groups, such as the Bahá'ís and the Druूसs, regard the Quran as sacred
 unitian universalist bhi quran se prerana lete hai
 Summaries of books such as Dietesiron, James's Protévangelin, Infancy Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Sudo Matthews bear similarities to the Quran
 ek vidwaan ne suzav diya he ki ek susamachar sadbhaav ke rup main diateceron ne is dharna ko janm diya hoga ki isai susamachar ek paath he
 After the Quran's incarnation, and the general rise of Islam, the Arabic alphabet rapidly developed into an art form
 chicago vishvavidhyalay main paas purvi bhashaaon or sabhyataaon ke professor vadaad kaadi, or yangstown state uniwarsity main islamic adhyayan ke professor mustasir mir, ke mutabik: The main areas in which the Quran made a noticeable impact on Arabic literature are dictionaries and themes; Other areas relate to the literary aspects of the Quran, especially oaths, metaphors, allegories and symbols

 The Quran has not only created an entirely new linguistic corpus to convey its message, but it also endorses older, pre-islamic words with older meanings and it is those meanings that are in the language and later i take roots in literature


 allaah ne is dharti par manushya ko apana caliph banaakar bheja he
 Before sending, he had properly explained to every person that they are going to earth for a short time, after that they have to return to him
 jahaan use apane un kaaryon kaa acha yaa bura badla milegaa jo usne dharti par kiye
 In the same way, there are many more
 is dharti par manushya ko kaary karne kii swatantraaa he
 The means of the earth are allowed to be used
 achche or bure kaary ko karne par use taktal koi roak yaa inaam nahin he
 But with this freedom, God arranged for the divine commands to be given to the human beings on the earth to live life exactly in that form, and he sent his messengers to every part of the earth, who sent the message of God to humans
 kaha jaataa he ki aise ishdooton kii sankhya 1,84,000 ke qareeb rahi
 Hazrat Muhammad was the final link in this connection
 aap ke baad ab koi doot nahin aayega kintu hazarat isa apane jivan ke shesh varsh is dharti par pun: guzaarenge
 The last book of God is in your hand, no other divine book will come now
 hazaron varshon tak nirantar aane vaale pegambaron kaa chaahe ve dharti ke kisi bhi bhaag main avatarit hue hon, unka sandesh ek tha, unka mishan ek tha, ishwariya aadesh ke anusaar manushyon ko jeena sikhaanaa
 Because of the passage of thousands of years, in the divine orders, human beings would add their thoughts, their convenience and create a new religion and distort the original religion and create a monstrosity and many times work against the divine orders
 kyon ki har prabhavi vyakti apni shakti ke aage sab ko natmastak dekhnaa chahta tha
 After all, the last prophet Hazrat Muhammad came to this earth with the Quran and the Quran came with the challenge of God that God himself would protect it
 1500 varsh kaa lambaa samay yah bataata he ki koran virodhiyon ke saare prayaason ke baad bhi koran ke ek shabd main bhi parivartan sambhav nahin ho sakaa he

 iske saath koran kaa yah chalange bhi apane sthaan par abhi tak qaayam he ki jo ise ishwariya granth nahin maanate hon to ve is jaisi puri kitaab nahin uskaa ek chota bhaag hi bana kar dikhaa den
 Knowing this form of the Qur'an, it should be known that this book was not given to Hazrat Muhammad in the form of reading it to the people and printed and put it in every house
 balki samay samay par 23 varshon tak aavashyaktaa anusaar yah kitaab avatarit hui or aap ne ishwar kii marzi se uske adeshon ke anusaar dharti par vah samaaj banaaya jaisaa ishwar kaa aadesh tha
 According to the western thinker HG Wells, discourses were given a lot on this earth, but on the basis of those discourses a society was first created by Hazrat Muhammad

 The scientific facts that are known to us are hidden in the Quran and there are hundreds of places where it seems that human knowledge has not yet reached that reality
 baar baar koran aapako vichaar karne kii daavat detaa he
 Invites to know the secrets of the land and the sky
 ek uljhan or saamne aati he
 According to the Quran's claim that he is for the people of the whole earth and for the rest of the time, but the Arabs of that time appear to be addressed to him
 sarsari taur par yahi lagata he ki koran us samay ke arabon ke liye hi avatarit kiya gaya tha lekin aap jab bhi kisi aise sthaan par pahunchein jab yah lage ki yah baat keval ek khaas kaal tathaa desh ke liye he, tab vahaan ruuk kar vichaar karen yaa ise note karke baad main is par vichaar karen to aap ko har baar lagegaa ki manushya har yug or har bhu bhaag kaa ek he or us par vah baat thik waisi hi lagu hoti he, jaisi us samay ke log|arabon par lagu hoti thi
 Great books have been written and can be written in relation to the Quran for Muslims
 yahaan u¬ddeshy koran kaa ek sankshipt parichay or uske ummat par kya haq hai, yaha spasht karnaa he
 There is a hadith recited from Hazrat Ali
 hazarat haaris faramaate hai ki main masjid main daakhil hua to dekha ki kuch log kuch samasyaon main jhagada kar rahe hai
 i went to Hazrat Ali and informed him
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- kya yah baaten hone lageen? maine kaha, ji haa
 Hazrat Ali ordered- Remember i have heard from Rasul Allah
 aap ne farmaaya- khabardaar raho nikat hi ek bada fitanaa sar uthayega maine arz kiya- is fitane main nijaat kaa zariyaa kya hoga? farmaaya-allaah kii kitaab
 The entire squeeze of the Quran comes in this one hadith
 koran dharti par allaah kii antim kitaab uski khyaati ke anuroop he
 It is very easy and it is also very difficult
 aasaan yah tab he jab ise yaad karne ke liye padhaa jaae
 If you do not fail in your destiny and want instruction from the Quran, then Allah has made this book easy
 samajhane or yaad karne ke liye yah vishwa kii sabase aasaan kitaab he
 It is in the Qur'an itself 'and we have made it easy to understand the Qur'an, so is there anyone to think and understand?' In the same way, there are many more
 duusari ore doorbini kii drushti se yah vishwa kii kathinatam kitaab he puri puri zindagi khapa dene ke baad bhi isaki gaharaai naapnaa sambhav nahin
 From this point of view, it is a sea

 And the centuries will pass, but the miracle of the Quran will never end
 keval hidaayat paane ke liye aasaan tareeqa yah he ki atal aayaton par dhyaan rahe or aayaton par imaan ho ki yah bhi allaah kii ore se hai
 The world is progressing continuously, human knowledge is increasing continuously, which was defunct yesterday in the Quran, today it has become clear, and tomorrow some parts of it will be clear
 isi tarah gnanarjan ke liye bhi do vibhinn tareeqe apnaanaa honge
 In the Qur'an in terms of orders, the contemplator must travel backwards
 koran ke aadesh kaa arth dharm shastriyon, vidwaanon ne kya liya, tabatabain, tabain ) ke saathiyon ko dekha
 ) And what did Sahaba mean by this
 yahaan tak ki khud ko hazarat mohammad ke qadamon tak pahunchaa de ki khud sahabe koran kaa is bare main kya aadesh tha? On the other hand, in terms of knowledge, it has to be considered further and continuously forward
 samay ke saath hi nahin usase aage chalaa jaae
 The surface of human knowledge is constantly increasing
 koran main vigyaan kaa sarvocch str he us par vichaar kar nae avishkaar, khoj or jo vaigyanik tathy hai un par kaary kiya ja saktaa he
 Mouzaza refers to a miracle that is on the hands of a prophet or Rasul and is beyond human power, to which the human intellect is shocked
 In every age, whenever any Rasul reached the divine orders of man, miracles were given to him by Allah
 hazarat musa ko asa di gai, jisase kai chamatkaar dikhaae gayi
 Hazrat Isa was given the opportunity to resurrect the dead, to heal the sick
 kisi bhi nabi kaa asal muajaza vah he jise vah daawey ke saath pesh kare
 Hundreds of Mojaz are described on the hand of Hazrat Muhammad, but the claim which is presented with the claim and which is still present to the world as a miracle, is the Qur'an which this disciple of the world is unanswered
 Be made as shown
 yah daawa koran main kai sthaan par kiya gaya
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran purna rup se surakshit rahegaa, is daawey ko 1500 varsh biit gaye or koran surakshit he, purna surakshit he
 This has been proven, which is a miracle
 The Qur'an has stood the test of science, and its scientific narratives are preceded by scientific efforts
 yah bhi ek chamatkaar he
 1500 years ago in the Arabian desert, an illiterate person presented a book that showed its truth in front of all the instruments of the twentieth century
 yah kaary koran ke atirikt kisi anya kitaab ne kiya ho to vishwa uskaa naam jaananaa chahega
 This miraculous form of the Qur'an is for us today and may be another miraculous form of it for the time to come
 jis samay koran avtarit hua us yug main uskaa mukhya chamatkaar uskaa vaigyanik aadhaar nahin tha
 The miracle of the Quran in that era was its language, literature, eloquence, which shook the language knowledge of the Arabs of its time
 yahaan spasht karnaa uchit hoga ki us samay ke arabon ko apane bhashaa gyaan par itnaa garv tha ki ve shesh vishwa ke logon ko ajami kehete the
 Due to the style of the Qur'an, the Arabic linguists fell on their knees
 koran aisi kitaab he jiske aadhaar par ek kranti laai gai
 Such illiterate people of the desert who had no importance in the world map at that time
 koran kii shikshaaon ke kaaran, uske prastutakarta kii training ne unhe us samay kii mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh laa khadaa kiya or ek aise korani samaaj kii rachana maatr 23 varshon main kii gai jiskaa uttar vishwa kabhi nahin de saktaa
 Even today, the world believes that the Quran and Hazrat Muhammad created an ideal society
 is drushti se yadi koran kaa adhyayan kiya jaae to aapako uske saath qadam mila kar chalanaa hoga
 Follow his education
 keval nijee jivan main hi nahin balki saamaajik, rajnatik or kanoonee kshaitron main, tab aapke samaksh ve saare charitra jo koran main varnit hai, jivit nazar aaenge
 All those difficulties and all those problems will come to the fore
 tan, man, dhan, se jo giroh is kaary ke liye uthe to koran kii hidaayat har mode par uskaa maarg darshan karegi
 The Quran is the rope of Allah
 is bare main tiramizi main hazarat zayd bin araqam dwaara varnit haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki koran allaah kii rassi he jo zamin se asaman tak tani he
 The word is from Hazur, described by Hazrat Zaid
 There is another hadith mentioned in Tabrani, which states that one day when a person was brought to the Hazur Mosque, he saw some people reading the Quran sitting in a corner and explaining to each other
 yah dekh kar aap ke chehre par khushi kii lahar daud gai
 You reached that group of Sahaba and said to them - Do you believe that there is no other Mabud except Allah, i am the Messenger of Allah and the Quran is the book of Allah? Sahaba said, or Rasul Allah we testify that there is no Mabud except Allah, you are the Rasool of Allah and the Quran is the Book of Allah
 tab aapane kaha, khushiyaan manaao ki koran allaah kii vah rassi he jiskaa ek sira uske haath main he or doosraa tumhaare haath main
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran allaah kii rassi is arth main bhi he ki yah musalamaanon ko aapas main baandh kar rakhata he
 The unity of ideas in them, at the time of differentiation, presents a perfect model for judgment and life by the orders of Allah
 It is in the Qur'an itself to hold the rope of Allah firmly
 koran ke mul aadhaar par musalamaanon ke kisi gut main koi takaraav nahin he
 The Right to the Qur'an has five rights on every Muslim of the Qur'an, which he should fulfill according to his power and ability
 koran ko samajhane ke liye uske avateern kii prishth bhoomi jaananaa zaruri he
 This is not the kind of book that has been written in full and given to the Prophet that he should go and call people
 balki koran thodaa thodaa us kranti ke avasar par jo hazarat mohammad ne arab main aarambh kii thi, aavashyaktaa ke anusaar avatarit kiya gaya
 From the beginning, as soon as some part of the Qur'an descended, you would write it down and also tell with whom it would be read
 avateern ke kram se vidwaanon ne koran ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the Makki portion, the other the Madni part
 aarambh main makke main choti choti suuratein nazil huin
 His language was superior, effective and of the highest literary rank according to the Arabs' preference
 uske bol dilon main utar jate the
 With his divine music, ears would listen to him and his divine light would get people attracted or nervous

 Their history, their atmosphere
 aisa paanch varsh tak chalata rahaa
 After this, the people who occupied the political and economic power of Mecca, sensed this danger for themselves, that they had to leave their homes and die in the small number of Muslims
 khud nabi ko ek ghati main saare parivarajanon ke saath qaid rahanaa padaa or ant main makka chhod kar madina janaa padaa
 This was a very tough time for the Muslims and the Qur'an revealed by Allah at this time was the cutting of the sword and the speed of the flood
 jisane puraa kshaitra hilaa kar rakh diya
 There are consolations for Muslims and prayers during this difficult time, which was the main part of this eight-year Quran
 is hinsaatmak prakaran se spasht hota he ki maanviya rachanadharmita evam bhaawanaaon kaa prabhaav is granth kii rachana main rahaa
 Thirteen years after the Makki era, Muslims found a center in Medina
 jahaan saare imaan laane waalon ko ekatrit kar tisare daur kaa avateern shuru hua
 Here Muslims were introduced to two new types of people
 pratham yahudee jo yahan sadiyon se aabaad the or apane dharmik vishwaas ke anusaar antim nabi kii pratiksha kar rahe the
 But when he saw the last prophet in his second demise, he created a ruckus
 koran main is daur main ahale kitaab par koran main sakht tippaniyan kii gayi
 In this era, a group of malicious people was born among the Muslims who pretended to be Muslims and kept meeting their opponents
 yaheen musalamaanon ko sashastr sangharsh kii ajna mili or unhen nirantar makka vaasiyon ke hamalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 On the other hand, with the establishment of an Islamic state, the divine rules were created for the creation of the whole society
 yudhd, shanti, nyaay, samaajik reeti rivaaj, khan paan sabake bare main ishwar ke aadesh is yug ke koran kii visheshta hai
 On the basis of which Rasul of Allah created an ideal state of social equality
 jiske aadhaar par aaj sadiyon baad bhi hazarat mohammad kaa kram vishwa nayakon main pratham mana jaataa he
 He did not give verbal instructions in every field of life, but showed it by following it
 is prishth bhoomi ke kaaran hi koran main kai baar ek hi baat ko baar baar doharaaya janaa lagata he
 Monotheism, religious order, heaven, hell, patience, religion are subjects of perennialism that were repeated again and again
 koran ne ek sidhe saadhe, nek vyapaaree insaan ko, jo apane parivaar main ek bharpoor jivan guzaar rahaa tha
 He stood before the two great powers of the world
 keval yahi nahin usne registan ke anpadh logon ko aisa sabhy bana diya ki puure vishwa par is sabhyataa kii chhap se saikadon varshon baad bhi peechha nahin chhudaaya ja saktaa
 The Quran presented the ideals of war, peace, state governance, family, which have influence in human society today

 kuch aayaton ke bare main unhone kaha ki ve ise galat yaa sahi nahin kah sakate kyon ki ve khud is baat main anbhigya hai
 It also included the first verse of the Qur'an that was translated

 aise saikadon udhaaharan hai jinhe koran kii is tikaa main aap nirantar padhenge
 There is a difference of opinion that when the Qur'an is such a siddha book, why do scholars differ from Hazrat Muhammad in his commentary so far
 yahaan itnaa kahana kaaphi hoga ki paigambar mohammad ne apane anuyaayiyon main sehatmand vibhed ko badhaava diya kintu matbhinnata ke aadhaar par kattarpan or gutbandi ko aapane pasand nahin kiya

 The literal verse Qur'an descended on Hazrat Muhammad, in divine words
 yah vahya shabdic he, arth ke rup main nahin
 This has to be clarified that in Christian educational institutions, it is taught that it is not in divine words but on the heart of the prophet that he describes it in his own words
 isaiyon ke liye yah vishwaas isliye zaruri he ki bibil main jo badlaav unhone kiye hai, use ve isi prakaar satya bataa sakate the
 The entire Christian and Jewish world has been trying for centuries to somehow prove that the Qur'an is the words of Hazrat Muhammad and is his creation

 In these circumstances, Guru ji awakened the consciousness of people to live with self-respect

 Baba Ram Singh Kuka was born in 1816 AD on Vasant Panchami in Bhai village of Ludhiana
 kuch samay ve maharaja ranjit singh kii sena main rahe, phir ghar aakar khetibari main lag gayi, par aadhyatmik pravriti hone ke kaaran inke pravachan sunne log aane lage
 Gradually there was a separate cult of his disciples, which was called Kuka Panth

 While coming to the fair in 1872, one of his disciples was surrounded by Muslims
 unhone use peeta or govadh kar uske munh main gomance thuns diya
 Hearing this, Guru Ramsingh's disciples were agitated
 unhone us gaanv par hamalaa bol diya, par duusari ore se angrej sena aa gayi
 Hence, the dice of the war turned

 50 of these were blown up on seventeen January 1872 in front of a cannon at Malerkotla
 shesh 18 ko agle din phaansi di gayi
 Two days later, Guru Ram Singh was also captured and sent to Mandalay jail in Burma

 Then Satguru Ram Singh issued instructions to teach both boys and girls equally to overcome these evils

 kaa naam aitareyopanishad he
 This Upanishad is Brahmavidyapradhan
 bhagavan shankaracharya iske upar jo bhashya likhaa he vah bahut hi mahatvapurn he
 In its upbringing, he decides for salvation and after annihilating karma and unproven knowledge, he only gives knowledge as his only means
 phir gyaanake adhikaar kaa nirnay kiya he or bade samaaroh ke saath karmkandi ke adhikaar kaa niraakaran karte hue sanyasi ko hi uskaa adhikari tehraaya he
 There they say that 'grihasthashram' is the name of the accession of its home special and it can only happen while the desires are there and there is a complete lack of desires in the knowledgeable
 isliye yadi kisiprakaar chittashuddhi ho jane se kisi ko grihasthashram main hi gyaan ho jaay to bhi kamnashunya ho jane se apane grihavishesh ke parigrah kaa abhaav ho jane ke kaaran use swatah hi bhikshukatv kii prapti ho jaaygi
 Acharya is of the opinion that 'yavajjivamagnihotram Juhoti' etc
 Sruti are only for the ignorant, no such method can be done for Bodhwan
 is prakaar vidvan ke liye paariwrajya kii anivaaryta dikhalaakar ve jigyaasu ke liye bhi unki avashyakrtavyata kaa vidhaan karte he
 For this, he has quoted 'shanta danta upartastishtu:' Atishrambhimya: Param prabham prawach samyagrishisanghajushtam '' Karmana na prajaya dhanen tyagainaike amritatvamanushu '' etc
 Shruti and 'gyatva naishkaryamacharathe' 'brahmashramapade vassate etc
 brahmajigyaasu brahmacharee ke liye bhi chaturthashramaka vidhaan karte hue acharya kehete hai ki uske vishay main yah shankaa nahin kii ja sakati ki use rintray kii nivritti kiye bina sanyas kaa adhikaar nahin hai; kyonki grihasthashramako sweekaar karne se purv to uskaa rini hona hi sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, the principle of Acharya is that anyone who has the curiosity of self-interest and who wants to be free from the eternal world, should be in any ashram, he should accept the world
 is siddhanth ke mukhya aadhaar do hi hai- Therefore, to acquire the wealth of knowledge and wealth and lack of desires - these are for the main purpose of homicide
 jo log ghar main rahete hue hi shamdamadi sadhansmpann ho sakate hai or jin bodhwanon kii nishkamtamen apane grihavishesh main rahanaa baadhak nahin hota ve ghar main rahete hue bhi gyanoparjan or gyanaraksha kar hi sakate hai
 Despite not being a ascetic by nature, he is actually going to follow Acharya's opinion due to his asceticism

 There are three chapters in this Upanishad
 unamem se pehle adhyay main teen khand hai tathaa duusare or tisare adhyyonmen keval ek-ek khand hai
 In the first chapter, it is told that there was only one soul at the beginning of creation, there was nothing else for it, it was a testament to folklore and by mere effort, it created the three worlds of Amba, Marichi and Die

 The body of the horse was brought thereafter but that too was rejected
 ant main paramatma ne unke liye manushya kaa sharir laayaa
 Seeing him, all the gods approved him in one voice, and they all were placed in the form of speech, soul, eye, etc

 In the end, they accepted him in the non-stop
 is prakaar yah sari sristi ho janaper paramatma ne vichaar kiya ki ab mujhe bhi isamen pravesh karnaa chaiye; kyonki mere bina yah sara prapanch akinchitkar hi he
 So he disintegrated the statue of the man and entered it by him
 is prakaar jeevabhavako praapt honaper uskaa bhutonke saath tadatmya ho jaataa hai
 When the Gurukripa realizes that he is interviewed in his all-pervasive pure form, he becomes 'indra' - 'indra' because of seeing him in an unconformed manner
 is prakaar ikshan se lekar paramatma ke praveshparint jo sristikram batalaaya gaya he, ise hi vidyaranyaswami ne ishwar sristi kaha he
 The world is enlightened: is aakhyayika main bahut-si vicitra baaten dekhi jaati hai
 In this way, nothing in Maya is ridiculous; However, Acharya's statement is that this is only economism
 iskaa abhipraay aatmbodh karaane main he
 It is said only to make the spirit unique
 Because the whole world is self-centered because of the soul's determination
 dwitiya aadhyatm ke armbh main isi prakaar upkram kar bhagwaan bhashyakaarane aatmatatvaka bada sundar or yuktiyukt vivechan kiya he

 paribhaashik shabdaawalee yaa paribhaasha kosh, "glassri" kaa pratishbd he
 "glassery" is basically derived from the word "gloss"
 "glos" greek bhashaa kaa glossa he jiskaa praarambhik arth "vaani" tha
 Later it became a sign of "language" or "dialect"
 aage chalakar isamen or bhi arthparivartan hue or iskaa prayog kisi bhi prakaar ke shabd ke liye hone laga
 The collection of such words is "glossary" or "definition Dictionary"
 gyaan kii kisi vishesh vidha main prayog kiye jane vaale shabdon kii unki paribhaasha sahit suchi paribhaashik shabdaawalee yaa paribhaashik shabdkosh kehalaati he
 For example, the words and their definitions in the study of mathematics are called the terminology of mathematics
 paribhaashik shabdon kaa prayog jatil vichaaron kii abhivyakti ko sucharu banaata he
 Mahaviracharya has said in the first chapter of 'mathewasarasangraha' called 'cognates': iske baad unhone lambaai, kshetrafal, aaytan, samay, sona, chaandi evam anya dhaatuon ke maapan kii ikaayiyon ke naam or unki paribhaasha diya he
 After this, names and definitions of mathematical operations are given and other mathematical definitions are given
 dwibhashik shabdaawalee main ek bhashaa ke shabdon kaa duusari bhashaa main samanarthak shabd diya jaataa he va us shabd kii paribhaasha bhi kii jaati he
 In terms of meaning, the vocabulary of a language is of two types - general vocabulary and terminology
 aise shabd jo kisi vishesh gyaan ke kshetra main ek nishchit arth main prayukt hote hai, vah paribhaashik shabd hote hai or jo shabd ek nishchit arth main prayukt nahin hote vah saamaanya shabd hote hai
 Famous scholar Acharya Raghuveer explains the difference between technical and simple words in very simple words - paribhaashik shabdon ko spasht karne ke liye anek vidwaanon ne anek prakaar se paribhaashaayen nishchit karne kaa praytn kiya he
 According to Dr
 Raghuveer Singh - dow bholanath tiwari 'anuwaad' ke sampadakeey main ise or spasht karte hue kehete hai- The tradition of terminology is believed to be from Philatus in "encyclopaedia Britannica" and elsewhere
 inkaa kaal teesri sadi i
 pus
 he
 He stored the terminology titled "atakta"
 kintu vastut: shabdaawalee kaa itihaas ab bahut peeche chalaa gaya he or ab tak praapt pracheenatam shabdaawalee hittit bhashaa kii he, jiskaa samay isa se praaia: 1000 varsh purv se bhi aage hai
 The oldest terminology in India is found in Nighuntu form
 sanskrit bhashaa main vikaas ke kaaran jab vaidic sanskrit logon ke liye duruh siddh hone lagi to vaidic shabdon ke sangrah kiye gaye, jinhen "nighantu" kii sangya di gai
 The Nighantu available today is that of Yasakacharya, but there is ample evidence of the belief that there were 4-5 more such Nighantu in Yask's time
 yask kaa samay 8veen sadi i
 pus
 mana gaya he
 This means that the term that Western scholars consider Philatus to be the oldest is at least 4-5 hundred years later than Indian nineteenths

 At the time of independence there were three types of areas under 'india' - in sabhi kshetron ko ek rajnatik ikai ke rup main ekikrut karnaa bhartiya rashtriya congress kaa ghoshit lakshya tha
 The Government of India achieved these goals more or less over time
 san 1947 main swatantra hone ke baad bharat swatantra riyasaton main banta hua tha
 The date of 15 August 1947 was deliberately set by Lord Louis Mountbatten as it was the second anniversary of Japan's surrender to World War II
 15 agast 1945 ko japan aatm samarpan kar diya tha, tab mountbaton sena ke saath burma ke jangalon main the
 To commemorate this anniversary, Mountbatten set August 15, 1947 for India's independence
 kintu bhopal ke logon ko bharat sangh kaa hissaa banane ke liye baad main do saal or intjaar karnaa padaa tha
 Then Sardar Patel united some 562 princely states in India and tied India in a formula and gave India its present form
 ek kushal prashaasak hone ke kaaran kritagya raashtra unhen ’louh purush‘ ke rup main bhi yaad karata he
 At the time of independence, there were about 562 princely states in India
 sardaar patel tab antarim sarkaar main uppradhanmantri ke saath desh ke grahamantri the
 Excluding Junagadh, Hyderabad and Kashmir, 562 princely states had voluntarily approved to join the Indian Confederation
 vastav main, mountbaton ne jo prastaav bharat kii aazaadee ko lekar jawaharlal nehru ke saamne rakhaa tha usamen ye praavdhaan tha ki bharat ke 565 rajavaade bharat yaa pakistan main kisi ek main vilay ko chunenge or ve chahen to donon ke saath na jaakar apane ko swatantra bhi rakh sakenge
 Out of these 565 princely states, most of which were Princely State, the princely states in India signed the merger letter one by one, or rather one can say that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and VP Menon got it signed
 bache rah gaye the - hyderabad, junagarh, kashmir or bhopal
 Of these, Bhopal was finally merged with India
 bharat sangh main shaamil hone vaali antim riyasat bhopal isliye thi kyonki patel or menon ko pataa tha ki bhopal ko antat: milanaa hi hoga
 If Junagadh had announced to meet in Pakistan, then Kashmir would remain independent
 junagarh, kashmir tathaa hyderabad teenon rajyon ko sena kii madad se vilay karavaaya gaya kintu bhopal main isaki aavashyaktaa nahin padi
 Bhopal where Nawab Hamidullah Khan was the Nawab of the princely state that extended to Bhopal, Sehore and Raisen
 is riyasat kii sthapana 1723-24 main aurangzeb kii sena ke bahadur afgaan yoddha dost mohammad khan ne sihor, ashta, khilchipur or ginnaur ko jeet kar sthapit kii thi
 After the death of friend Mohammad Khan in 1728, the princely state of Bhopal got its first Nawab as his son Yar Mohammad Khan
 march 1818 main jab najar mohammad khan nawab the to anglo bhopal sandhi ke tahat bhopal riyasat bhartiya british samrajya kii princeli state ho gai
 Hamidullah Khan became the Nawab of the same princely state in 1926
 aligarh vishvavidhyalay se shikshit nawab hamidullah do baar 1931 or 1944 main chembar of princes ke chancelar bane tathaa bharat vibhaajan ke samay ve hi chancelar the
 With the declaration of independence, he resigned as Chancellor in 1947, as he was in favor of the independence of the princely states
 nawab hamidullah 14 agast 1947 tak uhapoh main the ki wo kya nirnay len
 Jinnah had given him the post of Secretary General in Pakistan and offered to come there and there was a fascination of the princely state
 13 agast ko unhone apni beti aabida ko bhopal riyasat kaa shaasha ban jane ko kaha taaki ve pakistan jaakar secretary general kaa pad sabhaal saken, kintu aabida ne isse inkaar kar diya
 Lastly, the merger of Bhopal was one of the reasons behind it
 Nawab Hamidullah, who was Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes was very much involved in the internal politics of the country, he was a close friend of both Nehru and Jinnah
 march 1948 main nawab hamidullah ne bhopal ke swatantra rahane kii ghoshnaa kii
 In May 1948, the Nawab had declared a cabinet of the Bhopal government with Prime Minister Chaturanarayan Malaviya
 is samay tak aate-aate bhopal riyasat main vilinikaran ko lekar vidroh panpane laga tha
 At the same time, the patel-menon duo, the mastermind of the merger, was also under pressure
 ek or samasya ye saamne aa gai thi ki chatur narayan malviya bhi vilinikaran ke paksh main ho chuke the
 Prajamandal had become the main party of the merger movement
 oktober 1948 main nawab haj par chale gayi or disambar 1948 main bhopal ke itihaas kaa jabardast pradarshan vilinikaran ko lekar hua, kai pradarshnkaree giraftaar kiye gaye jinamein thakur laal singh, dow shankar dayaal sharma, bhenro prasad or uddhavdas mehta jaise naam bhi shaamil the
 The entire Bhopal was closed, the state police was trying to control them by throwing water on the agitators
 23 janvari 1949 ko dow shankar dayaal sharma ko aath maah ke liye jail bhej diya gaya
 In the midst of all this, VP Menon once again came to Bhopal, in clear words to the Nawab that Bhopal cannot remain independent, from the geographical, moral and cultural point of view, Bhopal is closer to Malwa, so Bhopal will have to be a part of Madhya Bharat
 
 aakhirkaar 29 janvari 1949 ko nawab ne mantrimandal ko barkhaast karte hue satta ke saare sutara ek baar phir se apane haath main le liye
 Pandit Chaturanarayana Malaviya had sat on a twenty-one day fast
 veepi menon puure ghatnakram ko bhopal main hi rahakar dekh rahe the, ve laal kothi main ruke hue the tathaa lagataar dabaav banaae hue the nawab par
 And finally on 30 April 1949, the Nawab signed the letter of merger
 sardaar patel ne nawab ko likhe patr main kaha -mere liye ye ek badi niraashajanak or dukh kii baat thi ki aapke avivaadit hunar tathaa kshamtaaon ko aapane desh ke upyog main us samay nahin aane diya jab desh ko uski jarurat thi
 Finally, on 1 June 1949, Bhopal became a part of the princely state of India, the Chief Commissioner appointed by the Center, Mr
 NB Banerjee, took charge and the Nawab received 11 million annual prizes
 bhopal kaa vilinikaran ho chukaa tha
 The tricolor, which was the symbol of the Nawabi rule of about 225 years old, was being lowered from the Lal Kothi and the tricolor of the Union of India was being offered

 Karl Marx had analyzed the concept of the state quite intimately in the first long work written after his phd dissertation
 is rachana kaa sheershak tha : 'critic of higels filosphi of state' 
 Marx later pondered the state deeply in his historical writings
 is sandarbh main 'class stregal in frans', 'ettinth brumer of lui bonapart' or 'civil waar in frans' kaa vishesh rup se ullekh kiya ja saktaa he
 Engels also discusses the state in detail in anti-duhring and Origin of Family
 lenin ne bolshevik kranti se thik pehle likhe gayi apane prabandh state and revolution main rajya ke marxvaadi sidghant kii punarvyakhya karne kii koshish kii
 Gramshi, in later Marxist thinkers, also took a deeper view of the role of the state
 lekin dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad marxvad main hone vaale vaad-vivaad main rajya par kam dhyaan diye jane kaa ek bada kaaran aadhikarik yaa soviet marxvad ke bheetar stalinavaad kaa varchasv tha
 Under this, there was an effort not to promote any deep debate about various categories within Marxism
 iske alaava, marxvad par aksar haaavee hone vaale aarthik nirdharanwad ke kaaran bhi rajya kii avadharana kii upeksha kii gayi
 Under this, it was assumed that the state is part of the superstructure, whose outline and nature are always decided by economic basis
 lekin saath ke dashak se marxvad ke bheetar rajya or isaki ‘saapekshik swaittata’ ke bare main kaafii gaharaai se vaad-vivaad shuru hua
 Scholars such as Althuse, Pollantz and Miliband contributed to it
 marks ne higel ke raajnneetik darshan kii samiksha karte hue rajya ke bare main apane vichaaron kaa vikaas kiya
 Hegel states in the Philosophy of Rights that there are three levels of social life: family, civil society, and the state
 parivaar ke bheetar ‘vishisht parmarthwaad’ hota he, jisamen vyakti apane parijanon kii bhalaai ke liye apane hiton ko bhi qurbaan kar detaa he
 On the other hand, civil society is an area of 'universal egoism'
 yahan har vyakti dusron ke hiton kii tulana main apane hiton ko zyaada mahatva detaa he
 People are also dependent on each other in civil society
 lekin dusron ke prati uskaa vyavhaar yantric or swaarth se bharaa hota he
 Hegel believes that the state is a realm that represents 'universal charitableism'
 ve ise maanviya chetana kaa aakiri or sarvocch padaav maanate hai
 In his view, the state reflects the wishes of every person
 marks parivaar or nagar samaaj ke bare main to higel ke vichaaron ko sweekaar karte hai, lekin rajya ke bare main nahin
 Marx says that in civil society, the competition between different individuals and classes extends to the state
 prabhutvshaalee varg apane hiton ko puraa karne or duusare virgon par apana prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye rajya kaa upyog karata he
 In fact, in Marx's writings, there are two types of ideas about the capitalist state
 aam taur par pehle sidghant kii zyaada charchaa hoti jiskaa varnan communist menifesto main kiya gaya he
 According to this, 'the executive of the modern state is the committee to manage the entire Burzwa affairs
 ’ yahan rajya ko shaasha varg ke ek yantra ke rup main dekha gaya he
 That is, in the capitalist system, the capitalists dominate it
 is tarah marks udaarataavaadi rajya ke buniyadi vichaar ko kaarij karte hai ki rajya samaaj ke sabhi logon ke hiton ke bare tatasth or nishpaksh rup se faisalaa karata he
 But Marx also offers a second view of the state in the Attinth Brumer of Louis Bonaparte
 isamen marks ne 1848 se 1851 ke bich frans kii krantikari ghatnaon kaa pareekshan karte hue tark diya he ki ‘rajya saapekshik rup se swytt’ hota he
 This means that the state is able to impose its will on society
 marks ke anusaar iskaa kaaran yah tha ki frans main bonapartwad burjwa ke ek hisse or sarvhaara ke ek hisse ke bich avasarwaadi or loklubhaavanvaadee gathjod tha
 Its main goal was to gain legitimacy for its rule
 isane yah dikhaaya ki yadi samaaj main varg-shaktiyon ke bich spasht santulan ho to rajya kii swaittata hasil kii ja sakati he
 The state is able to impose its will in such a situation
 marks kaa yah drushtikon unke pehle drushtikon se alag he
 Here the state is not a machine of the dominant class, but it also has some autonomy
 lekin rajya kii swaittata aseem nahin hoti
 He gets only partial autonomy
 rajya aapas main hode karne vaale virgon ke bich madhyasthata karata he
 In this way, it also upholds the existence of classes
 marks or angels ne is baat par jor diya he ki poonjeewaad kii samaapti ke saath poonjeewaadi rajya bhi khatm ho jayega or sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee sthapit hogi
 Marx clearly believed that the state is a device by which the economically dominant class can suppress other classes
 isliye har rajya varg-taanaashaahee kaa udhaaharan he
 The benefits of the proletariat here mean that the benefits of revolution would be preserved and the counter-revolution of the Burzwa class should be stopped
 lenin ne bolshevik kranti ke baad soviet union kii aavashyaktaaon or anubhavon ke aadhaar par sarvhaara varg kii taanaashaahee ke vichaar ko zyaada spashtataa pradaan kii
 He opposed this 'revisionist' idea in the State and Revolution, the state of Burjwa can be reformed
 unhone marxvad ke bheetar is vichaar ko puri tarah sthapit karne kii koshish kii ki burjwa rajya ko ukhaad phenkna hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 He added to Marxism the idea of party formation based on democratic centralism and clearly outlined the role of the party
 unke anusaar kranti ke baad sarvhaara varg kii taanaashaahee sthapit hogi jisamen poonjeewaadi shashan ke dauraan maujuud kuch khaas sansthaaon ko hataaya jayega or inaki jagah aisi sansthaayen sthapit hongi jo logon ko rajya-satta ke prayog main samarth banaaengi
 As people themselves start using state power, the need and role of state power will reduce
 lenin ke baad stallin ne yah sidghant sthapit karne kii koshish kii ki rajya sirf alpsankhyak yaa bahusankhyak ke hiton kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karata he, balki isamen har kisi kaa hit shaamil he
 In this way Stalin made the state and its decisions supreme
 lenin kii nigaah main yah khatara maujuud tha ki sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee party kii taanaashaahee main tabdeel ho sakati he
 Stalin vindicated this apprehension by his rule
 duusare deshon main bhi jahaan party ko centre main rakh kar marxvaadi kranti kii gayi, vahaan kranti ke baad sarvhaara varg kii taanaashaahee vyavhaar main communist party kii taanaashaahee ban gayi
 This made expression of disagreement impossible
 communist party dwaara shasit deshon main iske kaaran vyapak hinsa or rajkeey daman hua
 Traditionally, within Marxism, the state has been associated with repression or use of force
 italy ke marxvaadi chintan antonio gramshi ne marxvad main ek naye vichaar kii shuruyaat kii
 According to him, the ruling class does not maintain its dominance only through repression or use of force
 iske liye vah vichaardhaaratmak auzaaron kaa bhi prayog karata he
 He does not run his own work by using force, but also creates domination
 varchasv dwaara shaasha varg un virgon kii sahmati hasil karata he jis par use prabhutv kaayam rakhana he
 Education and mass media help in this
 inhen vichaardhaaratmak rajya-tantra kii bhi sangya di ja sakati he
 Gramshi made it clear that the state and the ruling class many times accepted many demands of the governed classes
 shasiton ko yah ahsaas dilaayaa jaataa he ki rajya ke kaam puri tarah unke hit main bhi hai
 Gramsci thus added a new dimension to the Marxist analysis of the state
 francisi vidvan lui alathuse ne vichaardhaaratmak rajya-tantra or damankaaree rajya-tantra kaa vichaar viksit kiya
 Althusse is structuralist
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki vichaardhaaratmak rajya-tantra or damankaaree rajya- tantra donon hi shaasha varg ke hiton ke anuroop vyavastha banaaye rakhane kaa kaam karte hai
 These two means or methods are interlinked despite being different
 pehla, damankaaree rajya-tantra he, jisamen kanoon, nyaayalay, police, sena or rajya kii duusari sansthaayen shaamil hai
 If a person does not follow the instructions of the state, he is punished by imposing a fine or sent to jail
 doosraa vichaardhaaratmak rajya-tantra he jo takat kii bajaay vichaardhaara ke madhyam se kaam karata he
 It includes those areas where we get and use our personal ideas and freedom
 alathuse spasht karte hai ki damankaaree rajya-tantra sirf bal-prayog par hi aadhaarit nahin hota, balki use bhi vichaardhaara kii madad leni padati he
 For example, the army, the court, etc
 also work according to a particular ideology at one level
 isi tarah vichaardhaaratmak rajya-tantra ke antargat aane vaali sansthaaon, masalan carch, skool aadi main sirf vichaardhaara kaa prayog nahin hota he balki isamen samay-samay par bal prayog bhi kiya jaataa he 
 Althusse considers the role of education as very important in the ideological polity
 gramshi ke vipareet ve ise sirf maanak, mulyon, samaaj kii sankalpana aadi ke vikaas se hi nahin jodate hai, balki unka maananaa he ki yah shram-vibhaajan main sanjeeda bhoomika adaa karata he
 That is, it makes specific people deserve specific labor
 baharhaal, gramshi kii tarah alathuse bhi maanate hai ki koi bhi shaasha varg tabhi apana varchasv kaayam rakh saktaa he jab vah damankaaree rajya-tantra or vichaardhaaratmak rajya- tantra, donon par apana niyantran rakhe
 Like Gramshi, he believes that it is necessary to challenge the ruling classes at the ideological level
 alathuse or gramshi ke vichaaron main kuch samantaayein hone ke baavjood yah spasht he ki alathuse ne sanrachnawadi ke rup main apane vichaar vyakt kiye or vyakti kii bajaay sanrachanaon kii bhoomika ko zyaada tarjeeh di
 He proposed that Marx's concept of production system has three distinct structures or levels
 ye teenon nazadiiki rup se or aantarik taur par jud kar utpaadan pranali kii matrix kaa nirmaan karte hai
 a social system can have any dominating political structure, economic, political and ideological, but the economic structure always determines who will be the most dominant among the three
 nicos polantsaz ne alathuse dwaara marks kii sanrachnawadi vyakhya kaa prayog rajya ke adhyayan ke liye kiya
 It is also noteworthy that between Polantas' first work and his second work, his ideas changed
 unki pehali kitaab political power and soshal classes 1968 main prakashit hui thi or duusari s tet power and socializam 1978 main
 The first book was completely structuralist
 isamen rajya varg-sanrachana kaa punarutpaadan karata dikhaaya gaya he, kyonki yah raajnneetik kshetra main aarthik varg sambandhon kii abhivyakti hota he
 Therefore, the nature and function of the state is determined by the structure of class relations
 apane is shuruaati kaam main polantsaz yah bhi tark dete hai ki higelvaadi adarsh kii tarah koi sarvasamaveshi or samyatit rajya nahin hota he
 According to the specific production system, there is also a state, such as capitalist state, feudal state etc
 iske alaava apni is kitaab main ve alathuse ke is vichaar kaa bhi prayog karte hai ki raajnneeti or arthshaastra ko ‘saapekshik swaittata’ mili hoti he
 With its help, they argue that the capitalist state is a class state and of course it must be relatively autonomous from the class struggle in production to function effectively
 is tark ke anusaar poonjipati varg kai dhadon main banta hota he or inamen se jis samooh kaa varchasv he, uske sanghathan ke rup main saapekshik rup se swytt rajya ek aise sthaan ke rup main hota he, jo kai dhadon main bante poonjipati varg ke varchasv vaale samooh ke sanghathan ke rup main hota he
 The struggle of the workers affects the state only to the extent to which it is part of class relations in production
 polantsaz ke is lekhan kii bahut saare staron par aalochana hui
 In this context, in the New Lecht Review, the 1969–70 debate between Rolf Miliband and Pollatsas has an important place within Marxism
 miliband ne 1969 main prakashit apni kitaab da state in capitalist sosayadi main polantsaz dwaara prastut rajya ke bahulwaadi model kii aalochana kii
 In this, he introduced his version of Marxist thought about the role of the state in the capitalist class-society
 amuman miliband ke najariye ko yantrikwaad or polantsaz ke najariye ko sanrachnawad kii sangya di jaati he
 Miliband criticizes the pluralistic model presented by Polantasz that members of the capitalist class have direct involvement in the state machinery and government
 is kaaran rajya burjwa hiton se sidhe bandhaa hota he or unheen hiton ko abhivyakt karata he
 Polantzas criticized it as saying that there is an objective relationship between the Burzwa class and the state
 iskaa arth yah he ki yadi rajya ke kaary saamaajik vyavastha ko tay karte hai or is saamaajik vyavastha main prabhutvshaalee varg kaa hit rajya ke hiton se miltaa he, to yah is vyavastha kaa ek ban jaataa he
 In such a situation, direct involvement of members of the ruling class in the state-plant is not the reason for this objective relationship, but its effect
 iske jawaab main miliband ne yah tark diya ki shaasha varg kii avadharana kii jagah vastunishth sanrachana or vastunishth sambandhon kii avadharana laane kaa matlab yah he ek khaas tarah kaa ‘sanrachanaatmak nirdharanwad’ yaa ‘saranchanaatmak ati nirdharanwad’ laana
 In the context of the debate between the two, Martin Cornoy has argued that both his writings actually have mechanical or deterministic tendencies
 isliye kisi ek ko yantrikwaadi or duusare ko sanrachnawadi kahana thik nahin he
 However, after this debate and many other ideas came to the fore, Polantz made a slight modification in his views
 apane baad ke kaam main polantsaz ne sanrachnawadi rajya ke vichaar ko chhod diya
 Instead, he emphasized that the nature of the state itself is determined by class struggle
 1973 main polantsaz ne yah tark diya ki saamaajik virgon or rajya ke bich alag tarah kaa sambandh hota he, jo ki poonjeewaadi vikaas ke charan par nirbhar karata he
 Therefore, the change in capitalist production relations determines the nature of political institutions
 poonjeewaadi rajya kii ‘sanrachana’ koi ‘sanrachana’ nahin hoti he
 Instead, these structures are dictated by class-struggle and consequent changes in capitalist production
 state, power and socializam main ve rajya kii ‘saapekshik swaittata ko dwandvatmak bana dete hai
 According to this argument, there is a possibility of class-struggle within the state-systems because contradiction lies within 'autonomy'
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki ye virodhabhas or saamaajik andolan rajya kaa swaroop tay kar rahe hai
 The Miliband – Polantas debate opened up a new dimension of state analysis in post-colonial capitalist-democratic states
 masalan, bharat main kai vidwaanon ne rajya kii saapekshik swaittata ko aadhaar banaakar bhartiya rajya kii prakruti kaa vishleshan karne kii koshish kii
 It is noteworthy that after the fall of the Soviet Union, many Marxist parties are adopting a double attitude towards the state
 ek ore ve rajya ke nav-udaaravaadi agenda or uske badhate damankaaree swaroop kaa virodh kar rahi hai, vahiin duusari ore unka is baat par jor he ki rajya garibon or haashiye ke samoohon kii bhalaai ke liye sakriyata se kaam kare
 It can be said that at the theoretical level marx-engels and Lenin envisioned a gradual extermination of the state after a time, but in states like the Soviet Union and China after the revolution, the state was safeguarding the revolution
 An important role was accepted
 baad ke daur main marxvad ke bheetar rajya main vibhinn samoohon kii bhoomika, rajya dwaara shoshit yaa sarvhaara samoohon ko niyantrit karne kii takanic or rajya ke swytt hone kii sambhaawanaaon par bhi gambheertha se vichaar-vimarsh hota rahaa he

 punarasar balaji punarasar kii pahchaan he
 Poonarasar Dham is famous in the infinitely graceful long section of Hanumanji Maharaj
 This is an awakened Hanumad place - Hanumanji Maharaj liberates his devotees from all kinds of troubles and frees them from fear
 In the court of Hanumanji Maharaj, Shradhalugan presents his application throughout the year
 The effect is as stated
 The history of this magnificent and huge temple of Hanumanji Maharaj has been quite ancient
 yah pavitra sthaan ret ke tibbo se ghira hua he
 Apart from the main temple, the ancient idol of Hanuman ji is with an old tree of khejdi
 punarasar hanumanji kaa mandir bikaner shahar se 50 kilometre punarasar gaavan main he evam shri duungrgarh se 40 kilometre kii duri par he
 In Samvat 1774, there was a severe famine; during the famine, people went out in search of grain and wages
 punarasar ke jairam das bothra bhi anaaj laane ke liye punjab kii yatra main gaye
 Sacks loaded on the camel When they were rolling Poonrasar suddenly camel's leg broke
 vah chalane laayak nahin rahi to jairam das ko jangal main hi rahanaa padaa apane saathiyon ko samajha buja kar unhen gaanv bhej diya
 Jairam Das was worried about the camel's leg breaking
 chintaa karte karte hi unhen neend aa gayi
 In the sleep, he felt as if someone was waking him up with a voice
 hadbadakar ve jage to vanha par unhen aawaaj dene vaala kanhi dikhaai nahin diya
 When they slept, the same sound of awakening them started coming again
 unhen aashcharya hua koi unhen aawaaj de rahaa he - par saamne koi dikhaai nahin detaa
 He remembered Ist Hanumanji and folded his hands and said, “who are you? tab hanumanji maharaj sadhu rup main prakat hue or kaha bhakt tum sankat main ho ye mujhe pataa he, par ab tumhaare sankat kaa samaadhaan ho jayega
 Having said this, he pointed to the idol lying under the foot of the khejdi and said, Take this Hanumad idol with you and install it in the village, there will be no trouble
 tab jairam das ji ne oontni ke pair tuutane kii laachaari jataai
 The sage disguised Baba said, Jairam Das, you feel free to lotto your camel is fine - yes, carry it in the sack and take this idol and worship it
 jab prabhu kii krupa ho jaye to koi bhi sankat aadmi ke samaksh tik nahin saktaa
 Jairam Das came to Poonrasar with a stone statue
 saathiyon ne jairam das ji ko gaavan main dekha to aashcharya main pad gaye par unhen kya pataa kii bothra ji ko pawan putr hanuman kii krupa kaa prasad praapt ho gaya he
 Jairam Das Ji did not install the idol according to Baba's instructions and he started performing Sithilya in regular service puja then another miracle happened to him
 ve ghar main sote kintu raatri main jab unhen chet hota to swayan ko vartmaan mandir ke khule maidan main pate
 When this incident happened again and again several times, Baba said like Purave that his idol should be duly installed and worshiped
 oswaal samaaj ke bothra jairam das ne kaha prabhu ham vaanik log he mandir bana kar puja archana kaise karenge yah to brahman varg kaa kaam he
 Then Baba said that you and your family should be sure that you worship me and this will increase your devotion and sensuality
 haan tumhe apni or se bhandare kii vyavastha kerani hogi
 Since then the people of Bothra family have come to worship Hanuman by building a small temple and this is the only temple where the passengers are provided with flour sugar, ghee as offerings and fuel and utensils for cooking
 jairam das ji ke uparaant to yanha bhaktajano ko anek prakaar ke chamatkaar hue hai
 This temple was established on Jyeshtha Sudi Purnima of Samvat 1775
 sthapana ke baad se yanha dur dur se bhakt log aane lage or baba ke darbar main bhaanti bhaanti kii abhyarthna karne lage
 Till then the Bikaner royal family started taking interest in the establishment of the temple and they supported the priest family in the establishment of the well
 prativarsh bhavy sthapana diwas kaa aayojan jyeshtha sudi poornima ko kiya jaataa he
 Three big fairs are organized every year 1- Chetri Sudi Purnima 2- Aasoj Sudi Purnima 3- Bhadwa Sudi is the first Tuesday or Saturday after Chhat
