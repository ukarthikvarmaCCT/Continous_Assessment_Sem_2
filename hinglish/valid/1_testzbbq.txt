 While studying fermentation of yeast into sugar alcohols in the 19th century, Louis Pasteur observed that fermentation was catalyzed by substances located in yeast cells, which he called 'fermenters'
 He wrote that, 'alcoholic fermentation is a function related to the life and composition of yeast cells and has nothing to do with the death or decay of cells'

 Amadeo Clemente Modigliani was an Italian artist who worked mainly in France
 ve mukhya rup se ek alankarik kalakaar the, unhen mukhauton-jaise chehre or lambe swaroopon kii visheshta liye aadhunik style main chitrakaari or murtikari karne ke liye janaa gaya
 He died in Paris due to tubercular meningitis, in which poverty, excessive work and the consumption of alcohol and drugs also played a role
 modigliani kaa livorano, italy main ek yahudee parivaar main hua tha
 The port city, Livorno, for a long time remained a refuge for the oppressed in the name of religion and the abode of the larger Jewish community
 unke par-naanaa, solomon garsin, 18veen sadi main ek sharnaarthi ke rup main livorano main aakar bas gaye
 Modigliani was the fourth child of Flaminio Modigliani and his French wife, Eugenia Garcin
 unke pita ek mudra-parivartak the, lekin jab unka vyapaar vifal hua, tab unke parivaar ko garibi kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 amedio ke janm ne parivaar ko barbaadi se bachaa liya, kyonki ek pracheen kanoon ke anusaar, lender kisi garbhvatee mahila yaa ek navjaat shishu kii maa ke bistar ko jabt nahin kar sakate the
 The bailiffs entered her home at the exact moment Eugenia went into labor pains; The family saved the valuable assets of their house by placing it on them
 modigliani kaa unki maa ke saath bada nazadiiki sambandh tha, jo unhen unke das varsh ke hone tak ghar main hi padhaayaa karti thim
 His health problems began after he had a pleurisy attack at the age of eleven, a few years later he developed a case of typhoid fever
 jab ve solah varsh kii thi ve phir se biimaar pade or us tapedic kii chapet main aa gaye jo aage chal kar unki mrityu kaa kaaran banane vaala tha
 After recovering from the second round of the Modigliani Pleurisy, his mother first took him on a tour of southern Italy: Naples, Capri, Rome and Amalfi and then northward to Florence and Venice
 unke dwaara kala ko ek vyavsaay ke rup main apnaane kii kshamta main unki maa ne kai myanon main, ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 jab ve gyaarah saal ke the, tab unhone apni diary main likhaa tha: Modigliani is known for painting from a very young age and his mother wrote that he began to consider himself "a painter" even before he started formal studies
 apni is galatfahami ke baavjood bhi ki unke kala kaa adhyayan shuru karne se unke anya adhyayanon main adchane aayengi, yuva modigliani kii maa ne is vishay ke prati unke junun ko hawa di
 At the age of fourteen, suffering from typhoid fever, he continued to delve into his paranoia that, most of all, he wanted to see Palazzo Pitti and the Uffizi painters in Florence
 livorano ke sthaneey sangrahalay main italvi punarjagran mastaron dwaara banaaye gaye kuch hi chitra the, florence ke vishay main jo kahaniyaan unhone suni thi usne unamem kautuhal paidaa kiya or apane beemaari kii avasthaa main, yah unke liye kaaphi niraashaa kaa strot tha, ki ve unhen kabhi aamane-saamne nahin dekh paaenge
 unki maa ne unase vaada kiya ki unke swasth ho jane ke baad, ve unhen khud florence le jaaengi
 naa keval unhone apana vaada puraa kiya, apitu unhone unhen livorano ke sirvshereshth chitrakaari guru guglielmo misheli ke paas bhartee karne kaa bhi zimmaa uthaaya
 Modigliani worked at Micheli's art school from 1898 to 1900
 yahaan unka sabase pehla aupchaarik kala prashikshan 19 veen shatabdi main italvi kala kii shaileyon or vishyon ke adhyayan main ot-prot maahaul main hua
 In his earlier Parisian work, traces of this influence and his studies of Renaissance art can still be seen: this budding work was shaped by artists such as Giovanni Boldini as much by toulouse-lautrec
 modigliani ne misheli ke saath jabaki acha kaam dikhaaya or apni padhai keval tabhi chodi jab ve apane tapedic ke shuru hone ke kaaran aisa karne ke liye majaboor hue
 In 1901, while in Rome, Modigliani praised the work of Domenico Morelli, a painter of emotional drama studies connected with the Bible and scenes from great literature
 yah vidambnaa he ki ve morali se itnaa prabhavit hue, kyonki is chitrakaar ne murtipuja kaa virodh karne vaale ek samooh ke liye ek prerana strot kaa kaam kiya jo di machieoli ke naam se janaa jaataa tha or modigliani pehle se hi machieoli ke prabhaav main aa chuke the
 The reason for this small, localized landscape movement was the need to react against the bourgeois framework by academic style painters
 Despite being sympathetically associated with the French impressionists, the Machiaioli did not have the same impact on international art as Monet's contemporaries and adherents have, and to date has largely been forgotten outside Italy
 is andolan ke saath modigliani ke sambandh guglielmo misheli ke madhyam se jude, jo unke pehle kala shikshak the
 Micheli was not only Machiéolo himself, but also a student of the famous founder of this movement, Giovanni Fatori
 misheli kaa kaam itnaa sajaavati or style itani aam thi kii yuva modigliani ne uske khilaaf pratikriya vyakt kii jiske tahat unhone leadscape ke junun ko andekha karnaa pasand kiya, jo french prabhaavvaad kii tarah, andolan kii visheshta thi
 Micheli also encouraged his disciples to paint on plain paper, but Modigliani did not enjoy working in this style, painting in cafes, but rather indoors and especially in his own studio
 used to like
 yahaan tak ki jab unhen landscape banane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, modigliani ne machieoli ke bajaay proto-cubist pallate kaa istemaal kiya jo kezane ke adhik samaan tha
 During his time with Micheli, Modigliani not only studied the landscape, but he also studied portraits, still-life, and nude painting
 unke saathi chaatr yaad karte hai ki antim vaali kriti main unhone apni sirvshereshth pratibha ko pradarshit kiya or jahiraa taur par is kishor ke liye yah puri tarah se ek shaikshik khoj nahin tha: jab ve nagn chitrakaari nahin karte the, tab ve ghar kii naukaraaniyon ke saath shaareerik sambandh banane main vyast rahete the
 Despite his rejection of the Machiaioli approach, Modigliani received encouragement from his teacher, who referred to him as "superman", a nickname that reflected the fact that Modigliani was not only proficient in his art, but He also regularly quoted from Nietzsche's The Spoke Zarathustra
 fatori swayam aksar studio main jate the or yuva kalakaar ke nawacharon kii saraahna karte the
 In 1902, Modigliani went on to continue the anthropomorphic human depiction of his life, under which he enrolled at the Academia di Bat Arti in Florence
 ek saal baad, jabaki ve abhi bhi tapedic se peedit the, ve venice main sthanantarit ho gaye jahaan unhone istituto di balle arti main adhyayan karne ke liye daakhila liya
 It was in Venice that he consumed charas for the first time and instead of studying, often took a walk in the defamatory parts of the city
 jivan style ke in chunaavon kaa unki viksit hoti kalatmak style par kya prabhaav padaa, yah anumaan kaa vishay he
 However, these options seemed to be more than just the usual teenage rebellion, or the kind of romanticism and orthodoxy usually expected from artists of the time; The discovery of the filthy part of his life has its roots in his radical philosophies, including those of Nietzsche
 ek chote ladke ke rup main apane naanaa ke sangrakshan main vidwaan darshanik sahitya ke sampark main hone ke kaaran, unhone apane kala adhyayan ke madhyam se nitshe, bodeler, carduchi, comte de lautreyamont or anyon ko padhaa or prabhavit bhi hue or yah vishwaas viksit kiya ki sachhee kalaatmakataa kii raah keval avagya or avyavashtha ke madhyam se nikalati he
 The letters he wrote from his 'sabbatical' period of Capri in 1901 clearly indicate that he is getting more and more influenced by Nietzsche's thinking
 in patron main unhone apane dost auskar ghiglia ko salaah di he; At this time Lautreyamont's work had become equally influential
 is durbhaagyashaalee kavi kii le shaints de malderor modigliani kii peedi ke paris ke atiyathartwaadiyon ke liye praathmik kaam ban gaya or yah pustak modigliani kii is had tak pasandida ban gayi ki unhone use yaad kar daalaa
 Lautreyamont's poetry is characterized by the closeness of the elements and the sadistic imagination; The fact of Modigliani being so influenced by this path at such a young age indicates his developing interest
 bodelair or di'anunazio bhrasht saundarya main apni ruchi ke kaaran or pratikwaadi kalpana ke madhyam se us samaj kii abhivyakti karke yuva kalakaaron ko samaan rup se lubhaate the
 Modigliani wrote to Ghiglia extensively from Capri, where his mother had taken him to help him recover from tuberculosis
 ye patr modigliani ke man main pakane vaale viksit hote vichaaron kii awaz kaa zariyaa the
 Ghiglia was seven years senior to Modigliani and it is also likely that he was the one who showed the young man his ability in Livorno
 Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani loved his older peers, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was that of a sympathetic listener, as he explains, especially in the complex letters he regularly sent
 And those still are
 i write to pour myself out to you and to affirm myself to myself
 i am the prey of great powers that surge forth and then disintegrate 


 a bourgeois told me today–insulted me–that i or at least my brain was lazy
 It did me good
 i should like such a warning every morning upon awakening: but they cannot understand us nor can they understand life


 Modigliani emigrated to Paris in 1906, which was the focal point of modern art seekers at the time
 vastav main, kalatmak prayog ke is centre main unka aagaman do or videshiyon ke aagaman ke saath sampaati tha, jo aage chal kar kala kii duniya main apane nishaan chhodane vaale the: gino severini or juaan greece
 He settled in La vatau-lavore, a community of poor artists in Montmartre, and rented a studio for himself in the Rue Caulaincourt
 haalanki montmartre main is kalakaar ke nivas se samanyikrut garibi jhalkati thi, khud modigliani ne shuru main aise pesh kiya jaise koi parivaar kaa ladkaa apane parivaar kii khoyi hui aarthik sthiti ke dikhaave ko vartmaan tak banaaye rakhane kii koshish karata he: unka pahanava bina aadambar ke bana-thanaa tha or jo studio unhone kiraye par liya tha vah ek style main niyukt tha jo kuch aaleeshaan chilman or punarjagran pratikrutiyon main bhalee bhaanti abhyaston ke liye sateek tha
 He soon attempted to disguise the Bohemian artist, but, in his brown corduroy, red dupatta, and large black hat, he also looked as if he had worn a pair of juggies in the grip of bad times
 jab ve pehali baar paris aaye, ve niyamit rup se ghar par apni maa ko patr likhaa karte the, ve academiye kolarossi main apni nagn chitrakaariyaan karte the or kam maatra main sharaab pite the
 Those who knew him at that time had an opinion about him that he was of a slightly serious nature and almost antisocial
 darj he ki us samay apane trademark kaamgaar kapade pahane hue picasso se milane par unhone tippanee kii thi, ki haalanki vah aadmi pratibhashali he, lekin yah unke bhadde pahanaave kaa bahaanaa nahin ho saktaa
 Within a year of arriving in Paris, however, his gait and reputation changed dramatically
 unhone khud ko ek vyavsaayik vidwaan kalakaar se ghumkkadon ke rajkumaar ke rup main parivartit kar liya
 After his transformation by poet and journalist Louis Laturet, the artist's former studio finds that the place is in disarray, Renaissance replicas removed from the walls and plush curtains frayed
 is samay tak modigliani pehle se hi ek sharaabi or nashili dawaaon ke sevak ban chuke the or unke studio se yah parilakshith hota tha
 Modigliani's behavior at the moment highlights his style of growth as an artist, in which his studio had become almost a sacrificial figure for all things of educational art that he hated and which he had until now The identity of life and training had remained
 unhone naa keval apane studio se apni puunjipati viraasat ke sabhi shringaaron ko nikaal diya, balki, ve apane purv ke kaamon ko vyaavhaarik rup se nasht karne lage the
 He explained his extraordinary act to his shocked neighbors and said: unke purv ke vyaktitv kii hinsak asweekruti ke liye prerana kaaphi atakalon ke adheen he
 This self-destructive tendency may have arisen from his tuberculosis and from the knowledge that the disease originally led him to a premature death: many within the artist's residence faced such a death and the general reaction was that As long as there is life to be enjoyed, mainly by indulging in self-destructive actions
 For Modigliani, this type of behavior may have been in response to the lack of identity, he lived with artists such as Utrillo and Sutin to gain acceptance and recognition from his colleagues for his work
 modigliani kaa vyavhaar in bohimian vaataavaran main bhi adig rahaa: ve aksar sambandh banaate rahe, baari maatra main madhpan karte rahe or chirita or charas kaa seven karte rahe
 In a state of intoxication, they sometimes went naked at social gatherings
 ve ek dukhad kalakaar kii pratimurti ban gayi the, jo maranoparant lagbhag vincent vine gaag ke samaan ek adarsh ban gayi
 During the 1920s, as a result of Modigliani's career and stimulated by André Salman's comments in which he attributed the origins of Modigliani's style to Chirayata and Charas, many candidates took their drugs and followed the extreme Bohemian path Tried to equal "success"
 salmon ne- galati se - daawa kiya ki hosh main rahane par modigliani puri tarah se ek sadak chhap kalakaar the
 While this publicity became a way to garner support for those who had an exciting longing to become a sad, doomed artist, these strategies did not create unique artistic insights or techniques in those who did not already have them
 vastav main, kala itihaaskaar yah suzav dete hai ki modigliani ke liye puri tarah se sambhav tha ki ve or adhik se adhik kalatmak oonchaaiyon ko choote yadi ve apane swayam bhoga main kaid na ho jate or uske dwaara barbaad naa kar die jate
 ham keval atakalein hi laga sakate hai ki apane aatm vinaashkari khoj se sahi salaamat ubhar kar ve kin oonchaaiyon ko chhu pate
 During his early years in Paris, Modigliani worked at a furious pace
 ve lagaataar chitra banaate the or ek din main sau chitra bana lete the
 However, many of his creations were lost - many he considered to be destroyed, destroyed, left behind due to changing his residence, or given to his girlfriends who did not keep him
 ve pehle henry di toluz lautrek se prabhavit the, lekin 1907 ke aasapaas ve paul sisen ke kaaryon se mohit hue
 antat unhone apni anokhi style viksit kii, ek aisi style jise anya kalakaaron ke saath purna rup se vargeekrut nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 When he was 26, he had the first serious love of his life in 1910 with Russian poet Anna Akhmatova
 The two had a studio in the same building, and although 21-year-old Anna was recently married, they began to have an affair
 lambii or kaale baalo vaali, pili pili or hari-bhuri ankhon vaali, vah kanya modigliani ke saundarya adarsh kaa moort rup thi or yah jodi ek-duusare ke prati mohit ho gayi
 a year later, however, Anna returned to her husband

 Soon he returned to Paris and this time he rented a studio in Montparnas

 Although several series of sculptures made by Modigliani were on display at the Salon d'automne in 1912, by 1914 he had abandoned the sculpture and focused only on painting, a move he made because war broke out to provide material for the sculpture
 There was difficulty in doing this and at the same time Modigliani was becoming physically weak
 modigliani ne montparnase main kai samakaleen kalakaaron or mitron kaa chitra banaaya he: shaim sutin, mojey kisaling, pablo picasso, diego revera, meri "marevna" vorobaaev-stebeska, juaan gris, maiks jacob, blez sendrars or jin cockteu, vishesh chitron ke liye sabhi baithe
 At the start of World War I, Modigliani tried to enlist in the army, but was refused due to poor health
 paris main modi ke rup main jane jate the, jo kai paris vaasiyon dwaara ' shaapit' ke rup main anuvaadit kiya gaya, lekin unhen doston or parivaar waalon ke bich deado ke naam se jane jate the, modigliani ek sundar purush the or mahilaon kaa adhik dhyaan aakarshith karte the
 Women continued to come into his life until Beatrice Hastings entered his life
 ve unke saath lagbhag do varshon tak rahi, unke kai chitron kaa vishay bhi bani, jisamen madam pompador bhi shaamil he or unke adhikansh sharaabi krodh kaa shikaar bani
 When British painter Nina Hamnett first arrived in Montparnasse in 1914, her first evening, a smiling man sitting at the side table in the cafe, Modigliani; Introduced himself as a painter and a Jew
 ve achche dost ban gaye
 In 1916, Modigliani befriended Polish poet and art dealer Leopold Zborowski and his wife Anna
 uske baad kii garmi main, roosi murtikar chanaa orlof ne unki mulaakaat ek 19 varshiya kala kii chaatra jain hevyutern se karai jo fujita suguharu ke liye pos de chukin thi
 Hébuterne, who comes from an Orthodox background, was abandoned by his Roman Catholic devout family for his association with the painter, whom he considered to be little more than a lustful abandonment and worse that he was a Jew
 apane parivaar ke virodhon ke baavjood, jald hi ve ek saath rahane lage or haalanki hebutern unke jivan kaa vartmaan pyaar thi, unke saarvajanik drishy modigliani ke vyaktigat sharaabi pradarshaniyon se adhik prasiddh rahe
 On 3 December 1917, Modigliani's first solo exhibition began at the Birth Well Gallery
 paris police pramukh, modigliani ke nagn chitron ko dekh kar rusht ho jate hai or pradarshnee ke shuru hone ke kuch hi ghanton ke bheetar use band karne ke liye majaboor kar dete hai
 After she and Hebuterne relocated to Nice, she became pregnant and on 29 November 1918, they gave birth to a daughter whom they named Jenny

 Modigliani managed to sell some of his paintings, but each sold for only a few francs
 Despite this, during this time, he mostly made such pictures which were later counted among his most popular and important works
 apane jeevankaal ke dauraan unhone apni kai kalakritiyaan bechi, lekin kabhi bhi koi bahut adhik paise main nahin bech sake
 Whatever money they received, they soon disappeared due to their bad letters

 Archaeological theories refer to the many different intellectual structures through which archaeologists interpret archaeological figures or materials
 puraatatv ke liye koi ekal siddhant nahin he, balki anekon siddhant hai, jiske anusaar puratatvvid yah vishwaas karte hai ki soochna kii alag-alag tarah se vyakhya kii jaani chahie
 is gyanakshetra ke puure itihaas ke dauraan kuch puratetvik siddhanton ke liye samarthan kii vibhinn pravritiyaan ubharin, charam par pahunchin or kuch maamalon main unka khaatmaa ho gaya
 Some archaeological theories, such as procedural archeology, believe that archaeologists may be able to develop accurate and objective information about past societies by using scientific methods in their research, while the post-procedural archeology, like the Khema, questions its veracity
 And claims that archeological material is characterized by human interpretation and social factors They can be distorted and therefore any interpretation of societies of the past is subjective
 iske badale marxvaadi puraatatv jaise anya puratetvik siddhant, puratathvik sakshya ko is dhaanche ke bheetar vyakhyayit karte hai ki kaise iske samarthak samaaj ke sanchaalan or uske vikaas ke sambandh main kya mat rakhte hai
 The first major phase in the history of archaeological theory is commonly referred to as cultural or cultural history
 sthalon ko alag "samskritiyon" main samoohbaddh karnaa saanskrithik itihaas kaa ek utpaada he, jisase ki in samskritiyon kaa bhugolic failaav or inke samay ke daayre ko nirdhaarit kiya ja sake evam un donon ke bich ant:kriya or vichaaron ke pravaah kaa punarnirmaan kiya ja sake
 saanskrithik itihaas, jaisaa ki naam se hi pataa chalata he, itihaas ke vigyaan ke saath nikatataa se sambhddha he
 Cultural historians employed the pragmatic model of culture, which theorizes that each culture is a set of ways that conduct human behavior
 is prakaar, samskritiyon ko shilp kaushal ke pattern se alag kiya ja saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye yadi khudaai se nikle ek ke bartanon ke tukade ko trikoniya pattern se sajaayaa gaya he to doosraa chaarkhaanedaar pattern ke saath or sambhav he ve alag-alag samskritiyon se sambandhit hon

 Changes in behavior can be explained by dispersal, where new ideas spread from one culture to another through social and economic relationships

 Substantial archaeological material was excavated and studied by the 1920s, which showed that expansionism was not the only mechanism through which change occurred
 antar-yuddh avadhi main hui raajnneetik uthal-puthal se prabhavit childi ne tab tark diya tha ki krantiyon ne ateet ke samaajon main bade badlaavon ko aakaar diya
 unhone ek navpashan kranti kaa anumaan lagaaya, jisane logon ko bhatakate hue shikaar karne ke badale basane or kheti karne ke liye prerit kiya
 This would have brought about significant changes in social organization, which led to the second urban revolution , as opposed to Childy's argument , which formed the initial cities
 is sookshm paimaane vaali soch apane aap main krantikari thi or childi ke vichaaron ko aaj bhi vyapak rup se prashansa pappt he auraunke vichaaron ko sammanit kiya jaataa he
 In the 1960s, many young American archaeologists, primarily Lewis Binford, rebelled against the norms of cultural history
 He proposed a "new archeology", which was more "scientific" and "human scientist"
 unhone samskruti ko vyavhaaraatmak prakriyaaon or paramparaon ke ek set ke rup main dekha
 
 prakriyaavaadiyon ne pariklpana pareekshan or vaigyanik paddati ke vichaar se yathartwaadee vigyaanon ko grahan kiya
 He believed that an archaeologist should develop one or more hypotheses about a culture taken under study and dig with the intention of testing these hypotheses against fresh evidence
 They were also disappointed with the teachings of the older generation, through which cultures took precedence over the people being studied themselves
 It was becoming increasingly evident through the evidence of anthropology that ethnic groups and their development were not always fully compatible with cultures in the archaeological record

 This is the first time in the history of Indian film, when a new language has been created for a film
 bharat ke pracheen samrajyon main se ek mahishmati, kii rani shivagaamee, ek vishaal jalprapaat ke nikat kii maand se ek shishu ko god liye baahar aati he
 She boldly kills the soldiers in her pursuit and sacrifices her own life to protect the baby
 ain samay par, sthaneey gramin pani main dubi rani kii upar uthi baanh main shishu ko dekh lete hai or us bachche ko surakshit bachaa lete hai
 In this way the queen merges by drowning in the falling waterfall from the height of the mountain
 sanga evam uske pati us shishu kaa naam shiva rakhte hai or apane balak samaan hi parvarish karte hai
 As time passes, Shiva grows up to be a powerful young man who aspires to climb mountains and tries unsuccessfully at times
 ek roj use jalprapaat main behate hue kisi yuvati kaa mukhauta miltaa he
 Desiring to find the identity of the young woman, he attempts a mountain climb again and eventually succeeds
 jalprapaat ke shikhar par, shiva us mukhute kii maalik avanatika ko khoj nikaalata he, ek vidrohi yoddha jiskaa dal gorilla paddati ke jariye mahishmati samrajya ke raja bhallaal dev / pallavathevan ke viruddh yuddh lard rahaa he
 The goal of the party is to rescue the former queen Devasena, who has been confined in the palace for the last 25 years in the palace
 or yah mahatvapurn jimmevary avanatika ko saunpa gaya he
 Avanatika loves to hear Shiva saying that he has come only for her while climbing all the difficulties of this waterfall
 shiva ab is abhiyaan ko apane jimme lene vachan detaa he or chhipate-chhupate hue mahishmati main pravesh kar devsena ko kaid se mukt karaata he
 Shiva redeems him and escapes with him, but soon the king's royal slave Kattappa, who is known for his excellent battle skills, follows him
 magar ghaat lagaae bhadraa, bhallaal dev kaa putr, achaanak hi shiva ke sar par waar karata he, magar katappa apane shastr gira detaa he jab use maaloom hota he ki shiva asal main mahendra bahubali he, divangat raja amrendra bahubali kaa putr
 Then here the past events of King Amarendra Baahubali which happened in the past are mentioned
 amrendra kii mata kii mrityu uske janm pashchaat hota he, jabaki pita usase kaaphi purv hi guzar chuke hote hai
 Sivagami, with the support of his bodyguard Katappa, takes over the reins of the empire until the new king is elected
 vah amrendra bahubali tathaa bhallaal dev ko samaan rup se parvarish detii he, unhen kala, vigyaan, chal-vidya, raajnneeti or yuddh kala jaise kai vidyaon evam prashikshan main paarangat kiya jaataa he, magar donon main hi samrajya ke shashan kii abhilaashaa bhinn rahati he
 While Amarendra treats Bahubali moderately towards the people, Bhallal Dev is extremely tough and takes every possible ruthlessness to achieve his goal, even he kills Bahubali
 jab mahishmati ko shatru kalaakeyas dwaara yuddh kii chunauti milti he, shivagaamee vachan detii he ki jo koi bhi kalaakeyas ke raja kaa sir katkar laaegaa use nayaa raja bana diya jayega or is tarah donon natinon ke bich barabari se yuddh sadhano kaa bantwaare kaa aadesh diya jaataa he
 But Bhallal Dev's handicapped father, Bijjala Deva, provides more and more fighting tools to Bhallal by deceit
 yuddh main jab mahishmati ek dfa asafal hokar apana ant samaj leti he, amrendra apane sainikon ko uske saath mrityu se hi ladane ko punah prerit karata he or shatruon ko kuchalakar yuddh samaapt karata he
 But Bhallal Dev already kills the king of Kalakeya, Sivagami chooses Amarendra Bahubali as the new ruler over his decision of superiority and leadership in the battle, making Bhallal Dev the commander for his courage and valor
 
 is purv ghatnaon ke baad, jab raja amrendra ke bare main prashn kiya gaya, to bhavuk katappa raja ke dehanth hone kii baat kahata he, or katappa swayan ko hi unki mrityu kaa jimmedaar bataata he

 ek haal kii europea adhyayan main sanket diya gaya ki sodium hypochlorite or carbonic rasayan kai gharelu safai utpaadon ke saath abhikriya karke chlorinikrut vashpashil carbonic compound bana sakate hai
 These chlorinated compounds emit cleaning, compounds are excreted during cleaning chlorinated applications, some of which are toxic and potentially human carcinogen studies have reported that when used with bleaching products, indoor air Concentration increases significantly
 The increase in chlorinated volatile organic product concentrations was minimal for plain bleaching and maximum for products with "coarse liquid and gel"

 In an emergency, drinking water can be purified: the ratio of bleaching to drinking water purification: 2 drops bleaching per liter of water or 8 drops bleaching per gallon water; 1 / 2 teaspoon bleach per five gallons of water
 If the water is cloudy, then add it to the filter bleach before bleaching the water
 Excess bleaching will not kill more bacteria and may be a health hazard

 In some cases, the base acidity of the bleach compromises the fatty membrane of the bacterium, similar to a balloon burst reaction
 The bleaching of micro-organisms effectively kills by making the bleach completely sterile, evergreen

750 saanchaa:srilanka ke jile or shahar Godan is considered to be Premchand's last and most important novel
 kuch log ise unki sarvottam kriti bhi maanate hai
 It was published in 1936 AD by the Hindi book Ratnakar Office, Bombay
 isamen bhartiya gram samaaj evam parivesh kaa sajiv chithran he
 Godan is the epicenter of rural life and agricultural culture
 isamen pragativaad, gandhivaad or marxvad kaa purna pariprekshya main chithran hua he
 Godan is the brightest lighthouse for the development of Hindi novel-literature
 godaan ke nayak or nayika hori or dhaniya ke parivaar ke rup main ham bharat kii ek vishesh samskruti ko sajiv or saakaar pate hai, aisi samskruti jo ab samaapt ho rahi he yaa ho jane ko he, phir bhi jisamen bharat kii mitti kii sondhi subaas bhari he
 Premchand has made it immortal
 godaan premchand kaa hindi upanyaas he jisamen unki kala apane charam utkarsh par pahaunchi he
 Godan depicts a living picture of the entire life of the Indian farmer - his aspiration and despair, his piety and self-pity with selfishness and meeting, his helplessness and innocence
 uski gardan jis pair ke neeche dabi he use sahalaata, klesh or vednaa ko jhuthlaata, 'marazaad' kii juthi bhaavana par garv karata, ringrastata ke abhishaap main pisataa, til til shulon bhare path par aage badhata, bhartiya samaaj kaa merudand yah kisaan kitna shithil or jarjar ho chukaa he, yah godaan main pratyaksh dekhne ko miltaa he
 How the clamor of the cities has covered the villages, how the landlords, mill owners, editors, teachers, professional lawyers and doctors, political leaders and royalists became leeches, exploiting this innocent farmer of the village and how the village itself Mahajan and Purohit are helping him, all these elements in Godan become as obvious as the slaughter
 godaan, vastav main, 20veen shatabdi kii teesri or chauthi dashabdiyon ke bharat kaa aisa sajiv chitra he, jaisaa hamen anyatra milanaa durlabh he
 Many things have been said in Godan
 jaan padataa he premchand ne apane sampurna jivan ke vyang or vinod, kasak or vednaa, vidroh or vairaygy, anubhav or aadarsh sabhi ko isi ek upanyaas main bhar dena chaha he
 This is why some critics get confused about it
 uskaa kathanak shithil, aniyantrit or sthaan-sthaan par ati naatakeey jaan padataa he
 It is the same when viewed from above, but a subtle look will show the amazing novel-skills of the writer in Godan, because all the things he has said have gone somewhere in proper lift
 premchand ne ek sthaan par likhaa he - 'upanyaas main aapaki kalam main jitani shakti ho apana jor dikhaaiye, raajnneeti par tark kiijie, kisi mehfil ke varnan main 10-20 prishth likh daaliye, koi dooshan nahin
 'premchand has shown the full thrust of his pen in Godan
 sabhi baaten kehane ke liye upyukt prasangkalpana, samuchit tarkazaal or sahi manovaigyanik vishleshan pravaahashil, chust or durust bhashaa or vanarnstyli main upasthit kar dena premchand kaa apana vishesh kaushal he or is drushti se unki tulana main shaayad hi kisi upanyaas lekhak ko rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The era when Premchand was born was full of socio-religious orthodoxy
 is rudhiwaad se swayan premachand bhi prabhavit hue
 When he started the journey of his fiction, he pledged to liberate the society suffering from many types of orthodoxy with the weapons of art
 apni kahani ke balak ke madhyam se yah ghoshnaa karte hue kaha ki "main nirarthak roodhiyon or vyarth ke bandhanon kaa das nahin hoon
 " premachand or shoshan kaa bahut purana rishta mana ja saktaa he
 Because Premchand, who was a victim of exploitation since childhood, became well aware of it
 samaaj main sadaa vargvaad vyaapt rahaa he
 Every person living in the society must join some or the other class
 premachand ne vargvaad ke khilaaf likhane ke liye hi sarkari pad se tyaagptr de diya
 He wanted to write oriented things related to it
 unke mutabik vartmaan yug na to dharm kaa he or na hi moksh kaa
 Meaning is becoming its life
 aavashyaktaa ke anusaar arthoparjan sabake liye anivaary hota ja rahaa he
 It is impossible to live without it
 vah kehete hai ki samaaj main jinda rahane main jitani kathinaaiyon kaa saamana log karenge utana hi vahaan gunaah hoga
 If people are happy in the society, then goodness will be more in the society and crime in the society will be less
 premachand ne shoshitvarg ke logon ko uthaane kaa har sambhav prayaas kiya
 He said, "people, when you have to live in the world, be like a living, what is the benefit of living like a dead
 " Premchand has exposed the misdeeds and misdeeds of various sections of the exploiting society in his stories
 upanyaas ve hi ucch koti ke samajhe jate hai jinamein adarsh tathaa yatharth kaa purna saamanjasy ho
 There are two parallel stories in Godan - one is the Rāmiya Katha and the other is the Nagari Katha, but in both these stories there is a correlation and balance
 ye dono kathaayen is upanyaas kii durbalata nahin varan, shashakt visheshta he
 If we have to understand the India of the time, then we should definitely read Godan, in which the circumstances of the country-period are accurately described
 katha nayak hori kii vednaa pathako ke man main gahari samvednaa bhar detii he
 The agony of the disintegration of the joint family breaks Hori but Godan's desire keeps him alive and he takes this desire into his mind and travels away from this world
 godaan aupniveshik shashan ke antargat kisaan kaa mahajanee vyavastha main chalane vaale nirantar shoshan tathaa usase utpann santras kii katha he
 Godan's hero Hori is a farmer who exists as a representative of the peasant class
 'aaajeevan durdharsh sangharsh ke baavjood uski ek gaay kii aakanksha purna nahin ho paati'
 Godan is the story of the conflict of Indian agricultural life
 'godaan' hori kii kahani he, us hori kii jo jivan bhar mehnat karata he, anek ksht sahataa he, keval isliye ki uski maryaada kii raksha ho sake or isiilie vah dusron ko prasann rakhane kaa prayaas bhi karata he, kintu use iskaa fal nahin miltaa or ant main majaboor hona padataa he, phir bhi apni maryaada nahin bachaa paata
 As a result, he makes his life of chanting and meditation
 yah hori kii kahani nahin, us kaal ke har bhartiya kisaan kii aatmakatha he
 And with this is the relevant story of the city
 'godaan' main unhone gram or shahar kii do kathaon kaa itnaa yatharth rup or santulit mishran prastut kiya he
 The organization of the stories of both has been done so efficiently that the flow in it remains constant
 premchand kii kalam kii yahi visheshta he
 Premchand's disillusionment with Gandhism is clearly seen in this composition
 premachand ke purv ke upanyaason main jahow adarshavaad dikhaai padataa he, godaan main aakar yatharthwaad nagn rup main parilakshith hota he
 Many critics have also given it the status of an epic novel
 pachapadara jhil rajasthan kii ek khaare pani kii jhil he jo rajya ke barmer zile ke balotra tehsil ke pachapadara gaanv main sthit he
 Salt is produced from this lake

 Tzekir is mostly composed of poets-poets, although it is possible to make prose-writers as well
 kabhi-kabhi kisi vyakti ki jeevani yaa jivan-sambandhi kahaniyon ko bhi 'tazakira' kah diya jaataa he
 While thousands of tweets have been written on important poets and other individuals, critics have criticized that many of them have been written in a caricature that includes unspeakable rumors and sometimes lions of another poet
 Have been mistakenly included
 television dharawahik yaa radio dharawahik aisi naatakeey katha ko kehete hai jise kishton main vibhajit kar ke un kishton ko television yaa radio par ek-ek karke dainik, saptahik, masik yaa kisi anya kram ke anusaar prastut kiya jaataa he
 These are called soap dramas or soap operas in English and many other languages because such radio serials were initially offered courtesy of soap-making companies such as Procter & Gamble, colgate-palmolive and Lever Brothers
 in dharawahikon ko tii ve serial yaa tii ve shrunkhlaa bhi kehete hai
 An important element of television and radio serials is the ever-expanding expansion of their stories, in which new stories begin within the main storyline and then evolve over several episodes and then culminate
 kai aisi kahaniyaan ek-saath chal sakati hai or dharawahik likhane-banane vaale aksar inkaa rukh darshakon kii badalati ruchiyon or bhaawanaaon ke anusaar banaate jate hai
 Similarly, by turning the story, the role of the characters who are interested in the audience is increased and they are often removed in which the audience is less interested
 bharat main 'ham log', 'kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi', 'sasuraal gendaa phool', 'yah rishta kya kehalaata he' or siaidi jaise dharawahik bahut safal rahe hai

 The existence of a rich diversity of unique species across many parts of the world exists simply because they are protected from obstacles, particularly large rivers, seas, seas, mountains, and deserts from other species of other country masses, especially high, ultra fertile, competitive The generalist are separating "super-species"
 These barriers are overcome by natural processes, through many millions of years in the future
 Continental drift can never occur
 But humans have invented ships and airplanes and now have the power to bring in contact that species have never met in their evolutionary history, and on the time-scale of days, centuries that historically accompany major animal migrations Is the opposite

 Purebred naturally evolved region specific wild species can be threatened with extinction in a big way through the process of genetic pollution ie uncontrolled hybridization, introgression and genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes as a result of either a numerical and / or fitness advantage of introduced plant or animal
 Nonnative species can bring about previously isolated species in contact, through purposeful introduction by hybridization and introgression about a form of extinction of native plants and animals, either through humans or habitat modification

 Attention has to be focused on the limitation of this under the problem of appreciation that is not always clear
 Morphological observations alone
 To some degree gene flow may be a normal, evolutionarily anatomical process and all constellations occur in genes and genotypes
 However, With or without introgression hybridization may not be preserved, however, a rare species' existence may be threatened

 Due to complete disuse because of un-profitability and uncontrolled intentional and unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding) formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution resulting in great loss in genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole

 The reason behind this is that in this sense, the invisible reason, since diversity is lacking, is to treat diversity in the same way as visible diversity, which can be the finest ecosystem type, one of this It is impossible to save the variation; it is thought as well as possible to preserve the diversity of the invisible ingredients

 isa, islam ke un 25 pegambaron main se ek hai, jinka ullekh quran main kiya gaya he
 According to Islamic theology, Jesus is placed second most important after Muhammad
 bible main die gaye unki aatmakatha se jude lagbhag sari daivi ghatnaon ko islam main mana jaataa he, jisamen: kunvarigarbha se janm, unke chamatkaar, unke cross par chadhaay jane, mrityu or mritotthana shaamil hai

 In Islam, Jesus is considered a venerable prophet who God sent to Israel to spread his message

 Most Muslims do not accept his death and return
 musalamaanon kii badi sankhya kaa maananaa he ki quran kii in aayaton main, jinamein messiah kii mrityu kaa ullekh he, vah keval bamuhaavara he
 Adhinash Ulema states that Christ was not crucified, but was taken up in paradise
 jabaki kuch anya ulema kaa maananaa he ki unako mrityu ke baad, ishwar dwaara punah jivit kiya gaya or phir jananath le jaaya gaya
 But it is agreed upon by all Muslim ulema that Christ will come back to earth at the appointed time, and will implement Islam on earth according to God's will
