229306 When the power of the Maurya dynasty was relaxed, Kalinga also became independent when many remote regions of the Magadha Empire began to be free from the subjugation of the Mauryan emperors
 urisa ke bhubaneshwar naamak sthaan se teen mile dur udaygiri naam kii pahari he, jisaki ek gupha main ek shilaalekh uplabdh hua he, jo 'hathigumpha shilaalekh' ke naam se prasiddh he
 It was engraved by Kalingaraj Kharavel
 yah lekh praakrit bhashaa main he or pracheen bhartiya itihaas ke liye iskaa bahut adhik mahatva he
 According to this, the kings of the independent kingdom of Kalinga were Cheti or Chedi Kshatriyas of the ancient 'ail dynasty'
 chedi vansh main 'mahamedhvahan' naam kaa pratapi raja hua, jisane mauryon kii nirbalata se laabh uthaakar kaling main apana swatantra shashan sthapit kiya
 The third generation of Mahamedhavahana was Kharavela, whose account is vividly mentioned in the Hathigumpha inscription
 kharvel jain dharm kaa anuyaayi tha or sambhavtah uske samay main kaling kii bahusankhyak janata bhi vardhaman mahavir ke dharm ko apana chuki thi
 According to the inscription of Hathigumpha, the first fifteen years of Kharavela's life were spent in the study of learning
 is kaal main usne dharm, arth, shashan, mudrapaddati, kaanoon, shastrasanchalan aadi kii shiksha praapt kii
 At the age of fifteen, he was appointed to the post of crown prince and after being in this position for nine years, at the age of twenty-four he rose to the throne of Kalinga

 Andhra was also one of the territories which became independent from the subjugation of the Mauryas
 apane shasankaal ke chauthe varsh main kharvel ne ek baar phir pashchim kii ore akraman kiya or bhojakon tathaa rathikon ko apane adheen kiya

 hathigumpha ke shilaalekh main kharvel dwaara parrast kiye gaye tamil desh sanghaat kaa ullekh he
 In the eleventh year of his reign, Kharavel once again invaded Uttarapath and bathed the Ganges water to the horses and elephants of his army
 magadh ke raja ko usne apane pairon par girane ke liye vivash kiya or raja nand kaling se mahavir swami kii jo murti patliputra le gaya tha, use vah phir se kaling waapas le aayaa
 Apart from this idol, many other loots were taken from Kharavela Magadha to his kingdom and he used it to build a huge temple in Bhubaneswar, which is also mentioned in a handwritten copy of the Brahma Purana in Orissa
 magadh ke jis raja ko kharvel ne apane charnon par girane ke liye vivash kiya tha, anek itihaaskaaron ke anusaar uskaa naam bahestimit tha
 He has also tried to read the name of this king in the Hathigumpha inscription
 par sab vidwaan is paath se sahamat nahin hai
 Mr
 Jaiswal, assuming the name of the king of Magadha as mentioned in the Hathigumpha inscription, is arguably synonymous with Pushyamitra Sunga and it is believed that Kalingaraja Kharavel attacked and defeated Sungavanshi Pushyamitra
 par anek aitihaasik hathigumpha main aaye naam ko na bahestimit sweekaar karne ko udyat hai or na hi pushyamitra ke saath milaane ko
 But there is no doubt that according to the Hathigumpha inscription, Kharavela had also conquered Magadha by invading Uttarapath and forced the king there to bow before him

 It is the most used system in the world in the field of science and commerce
 puraani metric pranali main kai ikaayiyon ke samooh prayog kiye jate the
 SI was developed in 1960 from the old meter-kilogram-second system, rather than the centimeter-gram-second system, which had many difficulties
 SI pranali sthir nahin rahati, varan isamen nirantar vikaas hote rahete hai, parantu ikaiyaan anterrashtriya samjhauton ke dwaara hi banaai or badali jaati hai
 The system is almost universally applicable and most countries do not even understand the official definitions of other units
 parantu iske apwaad sanyukt rajya america or britain hai, jahaan abhi bhi gaiyr-si ikaayiyon unki puraani pranaliyaan lagu hai
 In India, this system came into force on 1 April 1957
 iske saath hi yahaan nayaa paisa bhi lagu hua, jo ki swayan dashamalav pranali par aadhaarit tha
 Many new naming units came into force in this system
 is pranali main saat mul ikaiyaan or anya kai vyutpann ikaiyaan hai
 Other units are also used with the SI system in some scientific and cultural fields
 SI upsargon ke madhyam se bahut choti or bahut badi matraaon ko vyakt karne main saralata hoti he
 The difference between the definition and implementation of an entity is important
 prayek SI mul ikai kii paribhaasha saavdhaanee purvak banaai gai he taaki vah apurv or adwitiya ho or saath saath ek thos saidhantik aadhaar prastut kare jis par aadhaarit sabase parishuddh or punarutpaadaneey maapan kiye ja saken
 The process of implementing a definition of a unit is one in which that definition, like that unit, establishes the value of its quantity and the uncertainty associated with it; Can be used
 kuch mahatvapurn ikaayiyon kii paribhaashaayen kaise karyanvit kii jaati hai, yah BIPM kii websit par diya gaya haiek SI vyutpann ikai adwitiya rup keval SI mul ikaayiyon ke rup main hi paribhaashit hoti he
 For example, the SI derivative unit of electrical resistance, ohms, is uniquely defined by this relation: ω = m2 kg s − 3 a − 2, which is the result of the definition of the amount of electrical resistance
 vaise koi bhi tarika, jo ki bhautikee ke siddhanton / niyamon se saamanjasy rakhata ho, vah kisi bhi SI ikaayiyon ke karyanvayan hetu prayog ho saktaa he
 The metric system was designed by a group of scientists
 inamen antoni loriat lavashie pramukh the, jinhen aadhunik rasayanashastra kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 To make this group a rational measurement system; Was unified and authorized by the French Emperor Louis XVI
 francisi kranti ke uparaant nai sarkaar dwaara yah pranali angeekrut kar lee gai thi
 a new decimal meter was also adopted by the National Conference on August 1, 1793, and defined a temporary length as well as other decimal units
 7 april, 1795 ko, gramme evam kilogramme ne puraani shabdaawalee "gravet" evam "grev" kaa sthaan liya
 On December 10, 1799, the metric system was permanently adopted in France
 aaj vishwa bhar main prayog ho rahi metric pranali ne kai badlaav dekhe hai
 It has also superseded many traditional systems
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke bahut baad tak kai bhinn maapan pranaliyaan vishwa bhar main prayukt ho raheen thim
 Many of these systems were different from the metric system, while others were based on either the Imperium system or the American system
 tab yah aavashyaktaa siddh hui ki in sab kaa metrikaran hona chaiye, jisase ek vishwavyaapee maapan pranali banaai ja sake
 Consequently, the ninth General Conference on Weights and Measures was held in 1948 in which the International Committee on Weights and Measures was directed to conduct an international study of the measurement requirements of scientific, technological and teaching committees
 is adhyayan ke parinaamon par aadhaarit, dasvin CGPM ne 1954 main yah nirnay kiya ki chah mul ikaayiyon se ek anterrashtriya pranali vyutapann kii jaae, jo ki yantric evam vidyutchumbakeey matraaon kii saath hi taapmaana evam drushti sambandhi vikiranon kaa maapan uplabdh kara paae
 The six original units approved were meters, kilograms, seconds, amperes, degrees, calvin and candela
 1960 main, 11wein CGPM ne is pranali kaa namakaran anterrashtriya ikai pranali yaa International System of Units, sankshep main SI jo multah bana he french se: Le Système international d'unités
 saatvin mul ikai, mol yaa the mole, ko 1971 main 14wein CGPM main joda gaya
 The International Standardization Organization or ISO standard ISO 31 contains recommendations by the International Electrotechnical Commission or IEC for use in electrical applications of the international unit system, of which their standard IEC 60027 is also noteworthy
 vah kaary abhi pragati par he jisase kii donon kaa ekikaran kar ek sanyukt maanak ISO / IEC 8 xxrep 4 0 bane, jise matraaon kii anterrashtriya pranali yaa International System of Quantities kaha jaae
 In the international unit system, there is a group of units, with the same group of prefixes
 SI ikaayiyon ko do upasamoohon main baanta ja saktaa he :- These units as well mul ikai ke gunak banane hetu, SI upsarg ko joda ja saktaa he
 All multiples are absolute numbers of ten
 udhaahrantah kilo-= sahasr yaa hajaar mili-= hajaarwaan bhaag yani ek meter main ek hajaar millimetre hote hai, saath hi ek hajaar meter se ek kilo meter banataa he
 Prefixes cannot be mixed
 ek kilogram kaa das lakhwan bhaag he milligram parantu use ek micro-kilogram nahin kahenge
 To establish a relationship between the units used in different systems, the unit is created from the tradition or basic definition of the unit
 ikaayiyon ke bich antaran hetu antaran karkon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are several versions of transfer factors, see for example Appendix B, NIST SP 811
 spacific gravity ko praayah SI ikaayiyon main, yaa pani ke sandarbh main darshit kiya jaataa he
 Because a cube whose size is 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, its volume will be 1000 cm3, which is equal to 1 L; And when filled with water, its weight is 1 kg, hence the specific gravity of water is 1 g / cm3 and it will freeze at 0 ° C
 metric pranali ko arth evam dainik vaanijya saadhan ke rup main vishwavyaapee samarthan mila he
 The reason for this was also to a large extent that many countries did not have the ability to explain many principles in conservative systems
 saath hi kshetreey badlaavon kaa maanakeekaran kar ek vishwa vyapee pranali, jo sarv maanya ho, bani
 This also encouraged international trade
 vaigyanik drushtikon se dekhen, to isamen atyadhik badi or atisookshm ikaayiyon ko bhi dashamalav ke prayog se bataaya ja saktaa he
 Many units of daily and scientific experimentation are not derived from the seven basic units

 Some examples include: european sangh ne ek nirdesh diya he jo gaiyr-si chinhit saamaan kii bikri ko 31 disambar 2009 ke baad se pratibandhit karata he
 This applies to all products, attached instructions and papers, packing and advertisements
 lekin 11 sitambar 2007 ko, EU ne ghoshit kiya he, ki britain ko is nirdesh se mukt karte hai or unka imparial pranali abhi bhi aniyat roopen maanya hoga, saath saath main metric pranali ke diya ho to
 In Italy, the 'leaning Tower of Pisa' is considered a marvelous piece of architecture
 Ever since its construction, the tower has been continuously tilting downwards and due to this tilt, it has also been famous all over the world
 Because of this, there was a danger that it would fall one day
 pichley das saal se ek vishesh pariyojna chal rahi thi jiskaa maqasad lining tower of pisa ko sthayitv dena tha
 Under this, 70 tons of soil was dug from the ground from the north of the tower so that it could be erected directly
 When this work was finished, the tower started to appear to be standing upright
 After seven years, now the tower is 48 cm straight
 Engineers say that for the first time this tower is now absolutely stable
 When the construction of Vastu Shilpa was going on in the 20th century, the workers felt that it was leaning on one side
 The workers tried to fix it but even after it was fully ready, the tower was still slightly bent
 Later on the foundation of the tower and inside the tower mounted a hi-tech camera
 It has been shown that the leaning of the Leaning Tower of Pisa has stopped
 Officials monitoring this program say that the tower should be stable for at least two hundred years
 Thousands of people from all over the world come to Pisa to see the tower
 a few years ago, the tower was closed because of the danger of falling It was done
 11 saal tak band rahane ke baad disambar 2001 main ise phir khol diya gaya tha
 The leaning tower of Pisa started to be built in the year 1173 but it took 200 years to complete this tower

 Finally, because of this joint work, the first set of constitutions was implemented

 Furthermore, in it, the principle of parity was also introduced for the first time

 Under public pressure, President Iskandar Mirza upheld the coup in 1958; And thus this constitution was almost suspended
 sheeghra hi baad main general ayub khan ne iskundar mirza apdasth or khud ko raashtrapati ghoshit kar diya
 And so this constitution was able to run only for 3 years
 17 farvari 1960, ko ayub khan ne desh ke bhavishya ke raajnneetik dhaanche par report karne ke liye ek ayog kii niyukti kii
 The commission was formed with ten other members headed by former Chief Justice of Pakistan, Mohammad Shahabuddin

 yah samvidhan nihit 250 lekh baarah bhaagon or teen kaarykram main baanta gaya tha
 Like the previous constitution, it also talked about building Pakistan on Islamic values and keeping a unicameral legislature
 parantu 1956 ke samvidhan ke mukaable is samvidhan kii pariyojnaon ke mutabik pakistan ke raashtrapati ko anek karyadhikaar diye gaye the, or multah ek adhyakshiya vyavastha gathit kii gai thi

 The purpose of this committee was to create a constitution in the country, on which all political parties agree
 samiti ke andar ek antar yah tha ki kya desh main sansadeey satta pranali honi chahie yaa raashtrapati pranali
 Apart from this there were different views on the issue of provincial autonomy

 Ramachandra Chandrika, popularly known as Ramachandrika, is an epic poem by the famous poet Keshavdas of the beginning of the period of Hindi literature
 unchalis prakaashon main vibhajit is mahakavy main kul 1717 chand hai
 In this, the story of the well-known Lord Rama is described, but like other Ramayana, it is a poetry book rather than a devotional book
 'ramchandra chandrika' keshavadas kii suprasiddh kriti he jo saamanytah 'ramchandrika' kehalaati he
 The poet himself has clearly mentioned the time of its creation in the book- is prakaar iskaa rachanakaal 1601 i0 he
 The version of its original text was published in litho printing by Kanhaiyalal Radhelal, Lucknow
 isaki janaki prasad krit tikaa venkateshwar press, mumbai se san 1907 i0 main or navalkishor press, lakhanu se san 1915 i0 main prakashit hui

 Repeats of Lalaji's commentary started being published by Ramnarayan Lal Bookseller, Prayag from 1929 AD
 iske mul paath kaa ek pramanik sanskaran acharya vishwanath prasad mishra ke sampadan main 'keshav-granthawali, bhaag-2' ke rup main hindustani academy, elahabaad se bhi prakashit ho chukaa he
 'ramachandra Chandrika' is completed in 1717 verses, including a story list in 39 light
 acharya vishwanath prasad mishra ke anusaar yadhyapi is main suprasiddh ramakatha varnit he tathaapi yah kavy kaa granth he, bhakthi kaa nahin
 Keshava being a Dixit in the 'nimbarka Sampradaya' Radha was a worshiper of Krishna, not of Rama
 yadhyapi ramchandrika ramakatha sambandhi mahakavy he phir bhi is main varnit katha valmikiy ramayana or ramcharitamanas se bhinnata rakhti he
 However, according to the poet's mention, the inspiration to create this epic got him from Adikavi Valmiki
 unhone likhaa he ki The story of the first half of this period has some resemblance to the Valmiki Ramayana, but in the latter, the poet's personal origin and system is the main one
 is kavy ke madhyam se kavi kaa paanditya pradarshit hua he
 From the point of view of dialogue-planning, ornament-planning, verses-planning, this poem presents the skill of the poet's master
 isamen kavi ne susambaddha kathatmak parampara ko tod diya he
 In fact, he has taken direct support in this book from the Sanskrit 'prasannaraghava', 'hanumannataka' etc
 'kadambari' kaa bhi spasht prabhaav he
 By taking the basis of the plays and leaving the narrative part, the names of the speakers of the dialogues have to be kept separate from the verse
 samvaad-yojana naatakeey dhang se kii gayi he, isliye drishy kavy ke rup main iskaa upyog vishesh saralata se ho saktaa he
 In spite of the primacy of devotion in this poem of Keshav, Rama is considered an avatar and preached to him at many places
 parinamswarup upadeshaatmak ansh kaaphi ho gayi hai or kavyatv ko kshati pahaunchi he
 Keshava has been considered the era writer of Reetikal and the first teacher of Hindi
 is drushti se ramchandrika main bhi acharyatv kii prabalata spasht dikhti he
 From the point of view of style, there is a tendency to present examples of different types of verses
 aisa jaan padataa he ki kavi kisi ko pingal kii paddati sikhaa rahe hon
 The language of Ramachandrika is Sanskritpradhan Braj Bhasha
 sanskrit shabdon ke atyadhik prayog tathaa alankaar ke chamatkaar ke chakkar main pad jane se rachana bojhil or clisht ho gayi he
 In this book, the performance of Pandity is more powerful than the poet's warmth

 Study of Ramachandra Chandrika is indisputable in order to penetrate the ancient Hindi literature

 kachapatal kaa laal rang bhedane ke baad prakaash kii tivrata keval 40 pratishat hi rah jaati he or haraa rang bhedane par keval 25 prati shat
 Therefore, if it is mandatory to keep colorless light as well as red and green light, then they need to be reinforced

 sanchaar sadhano ke prabhaav ke kaaran is anshan kaa prabhaav samooche bharat main fail gaya or iske samarthan main log sadakon par bhi utarane lage
 He had demanded the Government of India to form a strong anti-corruption Lokpal Bill and had also given a draft of the Lokpal Bill to the Government in accordance with his demand
 kintu manmohan singh ke netritv vaali tatkaaleen sarkaar ne iske prati nakaaratmak ravaiya dikhaaya or isaki upeksha kii
 As a result, his attitude towards the fast started also remained neglected
 kintu is anshan ke andolan kaa rup lene par bharat sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main ek samiti banaakar sambhavit khatre ko taala or 16 agast tak sansad main lokapal vidheyak paas karaane kii baat sweekaar kar lee
 The bill presented by the government in the monsoon session beginning in August was weak and completely opposite to the Jan Lokpal
 anna hajaare ne iske khilaaf apane purv ghoshit tithi 16 agast se punah anshan par jane kii baat duharai
 The government stuck many obstacles in its path and arrested Anna Hazare and his associates on 16 August
 kintu isse andolan pure desh main bhadak uthaa
 a large number of dharnas, demonstrations and fasts were organized continuously for the next 12 hearts across the country
 antat sansad dwaara anna kii teen sharton par sahamati kaa prastaav paas karne ke baad 28 agast ko anna ne apana anshan sthagit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anna Hazare started a fast unto death on 5 April 2011 in protest against government inaction demanding the creation of a strong Lokpal Bill
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf unki is muhim main arvind kejariwal, kiran bedi, prashanth bhushan, baba ramdev evam anya anek prasiddh samajasevi shaamil the
 The government continued to neglect it
 is anshan ko bharat evam sheeghra hi vishwa ke sanchaar madhyamon main vistrut rup se prakashit or prasaarit kiya jane laga
 This ongoing effort against corruption soon got widespread public support
 bharat ke praayah sabhi shaharon main yuva sadakon par utar aae evam iske samarthan main pradarshan kiya tathaa parche baante
 Concerned over the spread of Anna Hazare's fast as a nationwide mass movement, the government immediately announced a committee to draft the Jan Lokpal Bill
 usne 16 agast se pehle sansad main ek majboot lokapal vidheyak paas karaane par bhi sahmati prakat kar di
 In this way, this fast came to an end and the mass movement that flourished against corruption ended with the hope of building a strong Lokpal
 kintu sarkari manshaa sandigdh thi isliye anna hajaare ne saath hi ghoshnaa kii ki yadi aagaamee 15 agast tak apekshit lokapal vidheyak nirmit nahin hua to ve 16 agast se punah anshan par jaayenge
 The government announced the creation of a 10-member Lokpal draft construction committee, in accordance with the terms of the cessation of Anna Hazare's fast in April
 isamen sarkaar ke 5 evam naagarik samaaj ke 5 pratinidhi rakhe gaye
 Anna Hazare accepted a minister to be the chairman of the committee, not opposing the logic of compulsion of the constitutional provisions of the government
 kintu kapil sibbal ke netritv vaali is samiti ke mantriyon ne apni manamaani kii
 There was opposition between the civil society representatives and the government over the issue of bringing the Prime Minister and judges under the Lokpal
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki bhavishya main kaanoon banane ke liye naagarik samaaj kii raay nahin lee jaaegi
 Finally, the ministers refused to accept all the important suggestions of the Jan Lokpal presented by Anna Hazare
 dikhaave ke liye jan lokapal ke ve sabhi bindu maan liye gaye jo sarkari mantriyon or saansadon, evam nyayadhishon ko lokapal kii pahunch se baahar rakhte the
 Finally disappointed with the attitude of government ministers, Anna Hazare's colleagues drafted the Jan Lokpal draft separately
 or is tarah samiti ne do masaude kaa nirmaan kiya jise kendriya mantrimandal ke saamne rakhaa gaya
 There too, the draft of the ministers was fully presented but the summary of the Jan Lokpal was kept
 or apeksha ke anuroop mantrimandal ne mantriyon ke masaude ko apanaakar sansad main pesh karne ke liye sahmati de di
 On 4 August 2011, the Lokpal Bill was introduced in Parliament
 sarkaar ke lokapal vidheyak main pradhanmantri ko unke kaarykaal ke dauraan iske daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya tha
 But all former Prime Ministers were placed under its purview
 iske anusaar lokapal ek samiti hogi jiske adhyaksh vartmaan yaa sevanivrutt nyaayadhish honge
 It will have eight members, of which four will be law-abiding and experienced people
 isamen jaanch kii samay seemaa saat saal rakhi gai thi
 India's 65th Independence Day celebrations were held in the shadow of Anna Hazare's announcement of the end of the April fast that if the government did not pass the Lokpal Bill by August 15, they would go on a fast
 15 agast se kai din purv hi yah spasht ho chukaa tha ki 16 agast se ghoshit anshan jarur hoga
 The government started every effort to stop it
 dilli police ne 1 agast tak jantar mantar par anshan kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare suggested four other places and asked for permission to fast there, but that too was not given

 aage sthaayee samiti ko i sabhi sujhaavon kaa vishleshan karne or yah bhi tay karne kaa adhikaar tha ki ve kitne vyaavhaarik hai
 Parliament had in principle upheld the basic logic of the government that the role of Parliament is paramount in framing the law and cannot be questioned
 sansad main din bhar chali bahes ke baad diemke, bahujan samaaj party, marxvaadi communist party, bhartiya communist party, samaajawaadee party or biju janata dal ne yah saafe kar diya tha ki lokayukta kii niyukti main sansad kii bhoomika nahin honi chahie kyonki isse rajyon kii swaittata prabhavit hogi
 Some of these parties had also cleared their intention to oppose any such move

 unhone yah nahin bataaya tha ki nyaayamurti saavant kii rapat ke baad is mudde par sukhtankar ayog ne jaanch kii thi or anna ko aropamukt kar diya tha
 The movement also reduced the stature of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Congress General Secretaries Rahul Gandhi, Ambika Soni etc
 as well as Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj, LK Advani, Sitaram Yechury etc

 a consumer is a person who either consumes or uses various goods and services
 vastuon main upabhokta vasteen evam sthaayee vasteen sammilit he
 The services we purchase include electricity, telephone, transport services, theater services etc
 dhyaan rakhane yogya baat he ki upabhokta vah he, jo upbhog ke liye vastuon evam sevaaon kaa kray karata he
 If a retailer buys goods from a wholesaler, he is not a consumer because he is buying the goods for resale
 kya yah aavashyak he ki ek kreta hi vastuon kaa upyog kare? yah sadaa nahin hota
 If you buy a copy for your writing, you are both a buyer and a consumer
 mana aapke pita khaadya saamagree kaa kray karte hai, jiskaa upbhog parivaar ke sabhi sadsy karte hai yaa phir jab vah kapade dhone kaa ditorjaint powder kharidte hai to iskaa prayog parivaar ke sabhi sadsy kar sakate hai tathaa anya koi bhi kar saktaa he
 This means that the items that a consumer purchases can be consumed by his family members or by someone else on behalf of the buyer
 upabhokta vah vyakti he, jo vastuon athwa sevaaon ko apane athwa apni ore se anya ke prayog athwa upbhog ke liye kharidta he
 Items include daily consumption and permanent items
 jabaki sevaayen jinke liye bhugtan kiya jaataa he, me yatayaat, bijli, film dekhnaa ityadi shaamil he
 The consumer can also be defined as the way a person, who chooses goods and services, spends money to obtain them and uses them to fulfill his need is called a consumer
 vastuon ke upabhokta evam sevaaon ke upabhokta kii sthiti main kya antar he? jin sevaaon kaa ham kray karte hai, unamem ham parivahan seva ko sammalit kar sakate he jaise- jab ham kisi sthaan par jane ke liye taxi athwa autoricshaw lete hai, saarvajanik bas main yatra karte hai athwa rail se yatra karte hai to ham parivahan seva kaa upbhog karte hai
 If you have your own bicycle or scooter or motorcycle you may need to repair it and take it to a repair shop
 jo vyakti marammat karata he aap use uski sevaaon ke badale bhugtan karte hai
 You are a consumer of the service at that time
 ham ghar par athwa kaary sthal par bijli athwa telephone kaa pratidin upyog karte hai, ye bhi sevaayen hai, jinka ham upbhog karte hai tathaa badale main bhugtan karte hai
 Watching cinema for entertainment in the cinema house is also an example of service
 vastuon evam sevaaon ke upbhog karne main mukhya antar he ki kray se pehle vastuon kii to bhautik rup se jaanch kii ja sakati he, jabaki sevaaon kii vishwasaneeyata evam nirantarataa kii pehle se jaanch nahin kii ja sakati
 For example, if you buy television, you can display it and see how it is working and how its picture, quality, voice etc
 lekin aap yah jaanch nahin kar sakate ki bijli kii voltage har samay sthir rahegi yaa nahin
 You can buy a food item as a sample first by knowing its taste or you can check if it is over-ripe before purchasing the fruits
 lekin aap isaki jaanch nahin kar sakate ki ek scooter athwa taxi kaa driver chaukanna rahegaa, koi durghatana nahin hogi athwa cinema dekhte samay chalchitra main tasviir or aawaaj puure samay thik rahegi athwa nahin
 In addition, the items we buy, we can consume them immediately or after some time
 ham anaaj kaa hafraton, maheenon tak sangrahan kar sakate hai
 If necessary repairs are made from time to time by a refrigerator, it can be used for many years
 lekin ham parivahan sevaaon athwa marammat, bijli kii aapurti athwa telephone seva athwa film sho ke sambandh main aisa nahin kar sakate
 If consumers become alert and face together against such wrong actions then this type of exploitation can be reduced
 apni raksha main swayan upabhoktaaon dwaara kiya gaya praytn upabhoktavaad kehalaata he
 Consumerism refers to the movement of consumers which aims at ensuring fair and honest behavior of the producers, traders, sellers and service providers towards the consumers
 yah andolan bazaar main vyaapt duraachaar ke sambandh main upabhokta main jaagrukta paidaa karne evam unke hiton kii raksha ke liye maarg khojane kii disha main kisi upabhokta andolankaaree athwa upabhokta samitiyon kaa praytn mana ja saktaa he
 This movement will be successful only when consumers are conscious of their rights and responsibilities while using goods and services
 upabhokta sangrakshan adhinium 1986 : upabhokta sangrakshan adhinium, anya kanoonon kii apeksha upabhoktaaon ko adhik sangrakshan pradaan karata he
 The consumer can get more detail or more in banking, insurance, finance, transport, hotel, telephone, electricity supply or other energy, housing, entertainment or amod-pramod etc
 yah adhinium rajya va kendriya str par upabhokta sangrakshan paraamarsh samitiyaan banane kaa praavdhaan karti he
 The quasi-judicial system has been devised for quick and proper settlement of consumer disputes
 isamen jila forum, rajya ayog tathaa rashtriya ayog ko shaamil karte hai
 These are called Consumer Courts
 aaj upabhokta ko bazaar main pratiyogita, gumraah karne vaale vigyaapan, ghatiya vasteen evam sevaayen tathaa anya bahut si samasyaon kaa samaanaa karnaa padataa he
 Therefore, protecting the interests of the consumer has become a matter of serious concern for the government and public institutions
 upabhoktaaon ke hiton kii raksha karne ke liye sarkaar ne upabhoktaaon ke kuch adhikaron ko manyata pradaan kii he
 In other words, if consumers want to protect themselves from exploitation and deception, then they have to recognize certain rights
 duusare shabdon main yadi upabhokta apane aapako shoshan evam dhokhe se bachaana chaahate hai to unhen kuch adhikaar dene honge taaki ve aisi sthiti main ho ki ve vastuon ke vikreta evam seva pradaan karne waalon se vyavhaar karte samay satark rah saken
 For example, one of the rights of consumers is the right of selection
 yadi aap is adhikaar kii jaankaree rakhte hai to aap dukandaar se ek hi vastu ke vibhinn kismein dikhaane ke liye kah sakate hai, jisase ki aap apni pasand kii vastu kaa chayan kar saken
 Sometimes the shopkeeper tries to sell the item of the brand on which he gets a higher commission
 ho saktaa he ki yah sarvshereshth gunvattta vaali vastu na ho yaa phir yah apekshaakrit kam mulya par uplabdh ho
 You can stop this behavior
 yadi aap apane chayan ke adhikaar kaa upyog karen tathaa yadi ek dukaan par adhik kism ke utpaada uplabdh nahin he to aap duusari dukaan par ja sakate hai
 Many consumer organizations have already taken steps to educate consumers through leaflets, magazines and posters
 is sambandh main tii
ve
 par kaarykram bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 There is a saying that there can be no rights without responsibility
 upabhoktaaon ke adhikaron evam in adhikaron ke uddeshyon kaa moolyankan karne ke pashchaat yah samaj lenaa aavashyak he ki kya upabhokta ke kuch uttardaayitv hone chahie, jisase ki ve apane adhikaron kaa prayog kar saken
 For example, if consumers want that they can exercise their right of hearing, they are also responsible to know their problems and keep getting information about them
 apni shikayaton ke nivaaran ke adhikaar kaa upyog karne ke liye upabhoktaaon ko sahi vastu ko hi mulya par chunane ke sambandh main saavdhaanee baratani chahie tathaa unhen yah bhi siikhnaa chahie ki kisi prakaar kii chot athwa haani ko rokane ke liye un vastuon kaa kaise upyog karen
 Consumer obligations include the following obligations in particular: in dayitvon ke atirikt upabhokta ke anya daayitv bhi hai
 They should strictly follow their contract with the manufacturer, merchant and service provider
 udhaar kray kii sthiti main use samay par bhugtan karnaa chahie
 They should not tamper with the medium of service such as electricity and water meters, bus and train seats
 unhen yaad rakhana chahie ki vah apane adhikaron kaa upyog tabhi kar sakate hai jab vah apane dayitvon ko nibhaane ke liye taiyaar athwa icchhuk hai

 Irrigation is the act of artificially watering the soil to increase the amount of water available in it and is commonly used during crop growing, to meet the water requirement of plants in dry areas or in the event of insufficient rainfall
