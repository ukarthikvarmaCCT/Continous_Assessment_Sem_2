 MJ { \ displaystyle M_ {J}} heavier brown dwarfs fusion of deuterium more than 13 times the mass of Jupiter and some astronomers classify these objects as larger than a planet but smaller than a sub-planet
 Brown likes to say Dwarf
 dutirium dwaara prajvalit yaa prajvalit nahin hone vaale donon prakaar ke taron kii chamak feeki hoti he or ye sainkadon yaa lakhon varshon main dhire-dhire thande ho kar mar jate hai
 However, the central temperature of the heavier dwarf stars will eventually reach 10 megakelvins, which is the temperature at which hydrogen fusion begins by the proton – proton chain reaction, first in deuterium and then in helium
 nabhikeey sanlayan kii shuruyaat bahut hi kam samay main aage chal kar hydrostetic santulan main parivartit ho jaati he jisame centre se nikalne vaali urja or adhik gurutvkarshan ke kaaran hone vaali durghatana se bachaati he
 Thus the star rapidly reaches a steady state

 They are found in warm and blue to cool and red spectrum varieties and have a mass of 0
5 to 20 solar masses
 ek taare kii chamak or rang isaki sataha ke taapmaana par nirbhar karata he, jo ki badale main iske dravyaman par nirbhar he
 a new star will end at a specific point in the main sequence of the Hertzsprung – Russell diagram
 chote, shant red dwarf taare hydrogen ko dhire-dhire jalaate hai tathaa sainkadon arabon varshon tak mukhya anukram par rah sakate hai, jabaki bade garm ati vishaal taare keval kuch lakh varshon baad hi mukhya anukram ko chhod denge
 a medium-sized star like the Sun remained on the main sequence for about 10 billion years
 ga
 aisa mana jaataa he ki is samay surya apane jivan kaal ke madhya main he; atah, yah mukhya anukram par he
 Once a star spends most of its hydrogen in its nucleus, it moves away from the main sequence
 paripakvata lakhon se le kar arabon varshon baad tak iske shuruaati dravyaman ke anusaar, helium main hydrogen kaa nirantar sanlayan iske nabhik main helium kaa nirmaan hone kaa kaaran banegaa
 Later years and star endings: kam dravyaman kaa tara kuch taare apane nabhik kii kuch jagahon par helium kaa sanlayan kar sakate hai, jisase ek asthir or asmaan pratikriya hone ke saath ghani saura aandhiyaan aa sakati hai
 In this case, the star would not form a planetary nebula, but instead would simply disappear as a small brown dwarf
 But an asteroid less than 0
5 solar mass will not be able to fusion to helium even after the nucleus has finished hydrogen fusion
 kyonki iske nabhik main paryaapt dabaav sahan karne ke liye taarakeey gaharaai adhik nahin he
 These are red dwarfs, such as Proxima Centauri, some of which lived thousands of years longer than the Sun

 The nucleus of the star is located in the center of the nebula, which cools down to become a small but dense white dwarf, weighing about 0
6 solar mass, but the volume is just like the Earth
 white dwarf mukhya lekh: white dwarf white dwarf sthir hote hai kyonki gurutvkarshan kaa andar kii ore lagane vaala bal taare ke electronon star ke apakarsh dabaav ke kaaran santulit rahata he
 Because there is no fuel left to burn, Tara releases her remaining heat into space for thousands of millions of years

 As it shrinks, it becomes more hot and dense and a new series of nuclear reactions begin
 ye pratikriyaayein uttarottar baari tatwon ko galaati hai, jo nabhik ko asthaayee taur nasht hone se bachaate hai
 Neutron stars yah gyaat he ki kuch supernova main, ati vishaal balon ke andar teevr gurutvkarshan electron ko parmaanu nabhik main dhakelta he, jahaan ve proton ke saath mil kar neutron banaate hai
 The electromagnetic forces that keep the nucleus out are removed and the entire nucleus of the star becomes a dense ball of a contiguous neutron or a single atomic nucleus
 blike hole mukhya lekh : blike hole aisa vyapak taur par mana jaataa he ki sabhi supernova farm neutron taron main nahin badalte
 agar taarakeey bhaar kaaphi adhik he, to neutron swayan hi kuchal die jaaenge or yadi isaki trigya shwarzchild trigya se kam nahin hogi to tara nasht ho jayega
 iske baad tara ek blike hole ban jaataa he

 abu sayed bin abi al-hasan yasar al-basri, aksar hasan basri 
 Sufi Islam briefly includes Imam Hasan al-basri, a Muslim cleric, Sufi
 pracheen muslim saadhakon main hasan al basri sarvaadhik lokapriy hai
 Like Indian sages, he gave more importance to sannyas in his life and less of mysticism like other Sufi saints
 unka janm madeene main san 643 i
 main hua tha or swargvaas 11 oktober san 728 i
 ko
 His mother was the hostess of Hazrat Muhammad's wife Ayesha
 hasan vastav main dhani the or heere-jawaharaat kaa vyavsaay karne vaale johari the
 But leaving him, he chose a difficult life for himself
 unhone chauthe khalipha hazrat ali se sanyas kii diksha lee thi
 He was extremely renunciate and Bhagavatrami
 lekin iske saath vah bahut achche kanoon daan or kavi bhi the
 His voice had a great impact on the people
 attaar ne unke bare main likhaa he ki vah bilkul ekant main rahete the or kisi se bhi unki koi chaah nahin thi
 Nobody had ever seen him laughing
 unke shishyon main sufi bhi the or kattar musalmaan bhi
 He considered the Supreme God to be the best, yet he said that through self-purification he can be found
 unka kahana tha ki sansaarik bandhanon ke mayajaal ko kaatane par hi manushya paramatma ko paane kii aashaa rakh saktaa he
 God who has renounced all desires and turned away from this fleeting world, will receive Himself
 basri kehete the ki paap karm main rat rahane vaale ko paramatma dand detaa he, isliye apane gunahon ke liye pashchaatap karo
 He had made a mistake in his childhood
 use vah bhul na jaaen or phir us karm ko dobaaraa na kar baithen, is baat ko baraabar samaran rakhane ke liye vah jab bhi nayaa vastra dhaaran karte the, to us samay use us vastra par likhakar rakhte or likhane ke samay aisa krandan karte ki behosh ho jate
 Hasan al-basri has said many times that do not spoil that other world by getting trapped in the temptations of this world
 unke mat se budhimaan vahi he jo koi bhi aisa kaam nahin karata jisase us sansar ko paane main baadha ho
 He said that true disinterest is what God is for
 swarg paane kii aashaa se jo vairaygy kiya jaataa he, vah vairaygy nahin he
 He once told Syed Zubair, a fakir living with him, that three things should always be avoided in the world - 1
 Do not forget to keep contact with the sultans 2
 Do not remain in solitude with any woman 3
 On someone's words Do not give ear hasan ne baar-baar duharaaya he ki nashwar jagat kii vastuon ke moh ko tyaago, kyonki bina unase chhutkaaraa paae duusare sansar ko paanaa sambhav nahin ho saktaa
 In fact, in his later Sufi means, the predominance of the mystic tendency is seen, not that of Hassan
 lekin fariduddin attaar ne hasan basri ke ek pravachan kaa uddhran diya he jisamen kaha gaya he- jab swarg main vaas karne vaale pehali baar apni ankhen kholte hai to saat lakh saalon tak bhavavishtavastha main rahete hai, kyonki apni param vibhuti ke saath paramatma apane ko unke saamne prakat karte hai
 In this way, the talk of reaching God, being interviewed, is also found in Hassan's discourses
 hasan basri kehete the ki anasakti kaa ek bindu sahastron saalon kii namaaz or rojaa se shreshth he
 He who has recognized God has established love for them and he who has recognized the world has enmity with God
 manushya kii apeksha bakrii jaisaa jeev bhi saavdhaan rahata he jo charvaahe kaa shabd sunakar charna chhodkar maidan se uski ore daud aati he
 But even after listening to the call of God, man does not go towards them and does not get rid of his enjoyment of happiness

 Debt control is specifically part of financial control once they are realized as cash or liquid resources that are employed by businesses in the manufacturing sector to ensure that they are sold as cash or liquid resources

 Debt control requirements are: Among the most important functions of the Reserve Bank of India is to control debt in the economy
 arthvyavastha main rin niyantran ke buniyadi or mahatvapurn jaruraton kar rahe hai- 1
 To encourage the overall development of those sectors of the economy i
e
 "priority sector" which are recognized by the government as "on priority basis" depending on their economic status or government interest
 in kshetron main mote taur par sankhya main lagbhag 15 karne ke liye yoga
 2
credit is not given for undesirable purposes, so as to keep a check on the channelization of the loan
 3
apsfiti ke rup main ke rup main acchhee tarah se mudrasphiti ko niyantrit karne ke uddeshy ko praapt karne ke liye
 4
to boost the economy by facilitating the flow of substantial amounts of bank credit to various sectors
 5
arthvyavastha ko viksit karne ke liye
 Credit control methods: There are two methods that the Reserve Bank of India uses to control the money supply in the economy gunatmak vidhimaatraatmak paddatibharat kii mudrasphiti rigerv bank kii avadhi ke dauraan apsfiti ke dauraan yah arthvyavastha main paise pump karne ke liye vanijyik bank kii anumati detaa he, jabaki paise kii aapurti simit karne ke liye apni nitiyon ko majboot karata he
 By qualitative method quality means we are instructed which uses bank credit
 bank udhaaharan ke liye, darshakon yaa bade puunjipatiyon laghu udyog, jabaki upabhokta vastuon ke udyogon or krishi rin kii kami se jujh rahe hai, arthvyavastha main vibhinn gadabadi or asamanta ke kaaran kul rin main adhiktar bade hisse par ho rahi he ki mahasoos kar sakate hai
 This type of modification of discrepancy is a matter of qualitative debt control
 gunatmak vidhi arthvyavastha main nakadi or rin kii channelizing ke tareeke ko niyantrit karata he
 It seems that depending on the situation, what is known as the 'priority area' spreads as for the other, where there is a 'selective method' of restricted control as a loan for some clause
 is vidhi ke tahat istemaal kiya upkaran hai- Marginal Requirement: The marginal requirement of the loan = the present value of the security offered for the loan value of the given loan
 seemaant aavashyaktaa he, un logon ke vyavsaayik gatividhiyon ke liye jiskaa shrey jaataa he arthvyavastha main pratibandhit kiye jane kaa pravaah bad jaataa he
 In case the flow of credit has increased, the marginal requirement will be reduced
 bhartiya rigerv bank ne 1956 ke baad se is paddati kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 Ration of loans: Under this method there is a maximum limit for loans and advances, which cannot be exceeded by commercial banks
 vishisht shreniyon ke liye bhartiya rigerv bank fiks chat
 Debt flow is to be checked specifically for speculative activities when used for such ration conditions
 "puunji: kul sampatti" kii nunatam sankhya ne bhi bhartiya rigerv bank dwaara nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he Publicity: The Reserve Bank of India uses media to publicize its views and its directions on the current state of the market that would be required to be implemented by commercial banks to control the unrest
 is paddati kii vajah se ucch nirakshartaa ko vikasshil deshon main bahut safal nahin he, haalanki yah mushkil logon ko is tarah kii nitiyon or iske nihitarth ko samajhane ke liye kar rahi he maujuuda
 Direct Action: Under the Banking Regulation Act, the central bank refuses to follow the instructions given by the Reserve Bank of India that commercial banks have the right to take strict action against anyone
 aise bainkon par bhartiya rigerv bank dwaara lagaae gaye rin ke aage badhaane par koi pratibandh nahin ho saktaa
 For example, the Reserve Bank of India had imposed some restrictions on the functioning of metropolitan cooperative banks
 iske alaava 'karad ke bank' 1992 main ek ko samaapt karne ke liye aayaa tha
 Ethical persuasion: This method is also being used by the Reserve Bank that the Reserve Bank of India, uses here to persuade commercial banks to follow their instructions / orders on the flow of credit, as the method that "ethical persuasion " is referred to as
 bhartiya rigerv bank apsfiti ke dauraan mudrasphiti ke dauraan rin pravaah par ek chat daal or rin dene main udaar hone ke liye vanijyik bainkon par dabaav daalata he
 Quantitative method: By quantitative debt control we mean control of the total amount of debt
 udhaaharan ke liye, america ke kendriya bank, apni gananaa ke aadhaar par rupee samajhataa he ki us par vichaar karte hai
 There is a maximum safe limit for the expansion of 50,000 credits
 lekin samay kii he ki bhi bindu par vaastavik credit rupee he
 55,000
 is prakaar yah to kendriya bank apni nitiyon kas dwaara 50,000 karne ke liye ise neeche laane ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Similarly, if the actual credit is less, say 45,000, then the Reserve Bank regulates its policies in favor of credit pumping in the economy

 Hip-hop dance refers primarily to the social dance or choreographed dance style performed on hip-hop music, or to that which is part of hip-hop culture
 These include a variety of styles, particularly braking, locking, and popping, developed in the 1970s by blacks and Latino Americans
 Hip-hop dance is often different from other dance styles because of its freestyle nature, and hip-hop dancers compete in formal or informal freestyle dance competitions
 Informal freestyle sessions and battles are usually performed in the void, which is a circular place to dance and is formed naturally when the dance begins
 Freestyle, Battles and Siphers - all three are key components of hip-hop dance

 Internationally, hip-hop dance in France and South Korea has made a special impact
 France is the birthplace of Tectonic, a Parisian style of dance that has a lot to do with popping and breaking
 France is also home to Just Debut, an international hip-hop dance competition
 South Korea is home to the international breaking competition R16 sponsored by the Korean government and broadcast every year on Korean television
 The country is constantly producing skilled B-boys that have been given the title of Gamblers by the South Korean government and the reverse b-boy crew have been officially named ambassadors of Korean culture

 The list reveals the main styles of hip-hop dance: breaking, locking and popping
 These are the oldest and most established styles of hip-hop dances
 They have gained worldwide fame, have been collected in films and hip-hop dances are being used the most in international competitions
 1970 ke shuruaati daur main neuyork ke branks main braking kaa avishkaar kiya gaya tha
 haalanki braking kaa avishkaar karne kaa shrey ashwet americanyon ko diya jaataa he lekin ve latinos the jinhone braking ko jivit rakhaa jab 70 ke aakhri daur main use khatm mana ja rahaa tha

 is sthiti ke kaaran ise hip-hop nrity kaa shuddhtam rup mana jaataa he
 braking main chaar moolbhoot nrity shaamil hai: toprock - khadey hokar pradarshan karte vakt footwork unmukh kadam, downerok - footwork karte vakt apane haath se apana vazan sanbhaalanaa; freezes -apane haath par kiye jane vaale stylish kadam or power muves - kalabaji karne ke kathin or prabhaavshaalee tareeke

 "is ghatana kaa kawarej new york times, da village waes, da daily news, neshnal jeographic or sthaneey steshnon ne kiya tha jisaki vajah se duniya kaa dhyaan bi-bwaying kii ore gaya
" Locking, originally called Campbell Locking, was built in Los Angeles by Campbell Dawn and was introduced in the country by his crew, The Lockers
 Locking sounds like popping and this often leads to confusion with popping
 In locking, a dancer maintains his position for a long time
 Lock is the primary activity used in locking
 It is similar to freeze or stop suddenly
 The specialty of the dance of a locker is the constant locking in its place and quickly stopping again
 It is wrong to call locking pop-locking
 Popping and locking are two different styles, each with its own history, its own dance postures, and its competition categories
 a dancer can do one or the other dance but cannot do both at the same time
 It was only after watching The Lockers performing on TV that a young boogaloo was inspired to create Sam Popping and Electric Boogaloo
 The lockers were composed by combining small groups of earlier lockers and robotic dancers
 In addition to Don Campbell, original members include Fred "mr
 Pinguin" Berry, Leo "flaky Luke" Williamson, Adolfo "shaba Do" Queen's, Bill "slim the Robot" Williams, Greg "campbelllock Jr
" Pope and Tony Basil - the group's manager

 prayek up-style ke bich kaa antar yah he ki unamem popping kitna atiranjit he

 popping itani saralata se kiya jaataa he ki kriyaayein popping lagati hi nahin hai, vah taral lagati hai
 iskaa vipareet tiking he, jisamen kriyaayein sthitik, achaanak or jatkedaar hai
 Popping - also referred to by the term umbrella - includes gliding, floating and sliding, a lower body dance performed by the legs and feet
 When done correctly, it seems that the dancers are gliding on the ground in the same way as on ice
 The opposite of gliding is stuttering which is the dance of the upper body in which the arms, hands and wrists are shaped using right angles and geometric boxes
 Sometimes the arm is not used at all and stuttering is done only with the wrist, hands and fingers
 In both forms, verbs are complex and always use a 90 ° angle
 When done correctly, the bhutting seems to be a character built on ancient Egyptian art - that's why it is named in the context of King Tut
 "while Sam was creating popping and boogaloo, others were creating and practicing unique styles of their own
 Back in the day many different areas in the west coast were known for their own distinct styles, each with their own rich history behind them
 Some of these areas included Oakland, Sacramento and San Francisco
" Although popping is used as an umbrella term by hip-hop dancers, Popin Pete of Electric Boogalooz disagrees with such use of popping
 He said, "there are also people who wave and there are people who break
 They are not popping
 i say that people who have created other genres are given their legitimate dues and their theater
 Materials should be given
 " Many of these related styles cannot be associated with any particular person or group
 The Electric Boogloose himself admits this
 Other genres may be influenced by styles prior to hip-hop
 In 1920 Earl "snake Hips" Tucker was a professional dancer who appeared in the film Symphony in Black and performed at the Cotton Club in Harlem
 Because '20s was not hip-hop and his style was considered jazz but his "slipping, kai antarrashtriya hip-hop nrity pratispardhaaen hai
 in main se adhiktar pratiyogitaayen vishisht desh yaa mahadweep ke kshetreey toornament tak simit rahati hai
 ye pratiyogitaayen samooh yaa ekal kalakaar ko sirf ek kshetreey oopaadhi hi nahin detii balki antarrashtriya championships ke antim daur kii paatrata ke rup main mauka bhi pradaan karti hai
 Hip-hop novelty and fad dance are often dance styles rather than the styles of dance performed at parties which are quite popular due to their novelty
 Many of these fads are produced by dance music artists such as MC Hammer who created Hammer Dance and Digital Underground who created Humpty Dance
 Hammer dances and humpty dances were nationally famous dance stances that became popular but slowly faded as they became associated with songs that had lost popularity
 Other examples include Harlem Shake, Soulja Boy, Aunt Jackie, The Shoulder Lean and The Snap Dance
 tectonic ek aisi nrity style he jisamen vaug, braking or popping bhi shaamil he jise france ke paris main metropolis nitaclebs main shuru kiya gaya

 Apart from party, hip-hop dance has established itself on the internet through social networking
 Websites such as dancejam and West Coast Popin were created specifically for dancers to create their profiles and interact with each other
 The West Coast Popin focuses specifically on poppers and lockers, while dancejams comprise all hip-hop dance styles
 Dance Jam was founded in 2008 by defree Aron, Anthony Young and MC Hammer
 Their website organizes online dance competition and posts online tutorials to learn popular hip-hop dance moves
 Legion of Extraordinary Dancers is a web series that portrays hip-hop dancers as super heroes
 Each genre has its own distinct dance talent including crumping, tooting, breaking, boogaloo, locking, popping, tricking and ballot
 The Advertising Age gave a good review of the series and said "


 every episode of 'LXD' has a treasure trove of eight or nine minutes of narrative sophistication
 Compare it with the values of theater production and with a character who Takes himself to an unrighteous extent and finally results - pun time! - extraordinary
 " The series premiered in Hulu on July 7 in 2010
 jaisaa ki pehle hi bataaya gaya he, nrity samooh sadak nartakon kaa ek dal he jo ek saath milakar nrity kii chaal taiyaar karata he
 neuyork main hip-hop samskruti ke failane ke saath adhik se adhik samooh milakar abhyaas karne lage or ek duusare ke saath pratispardhaa karne lage

 aaj yojit hone vaali pratiyogitaaon main toliyaan, desh bhar se or duniya bhar se aane vaali anya toliyon ke saath muqabla kar sakati hai
 Even today, teams are made on the basis of friendship and neighborhood
 They are also formed on the basis of many other reasons, such as subject, gender beat frix, ethnicity and dance style
 The teams are not specific
 It is normal for dancers to join more than one group, especially if a particular group is genre specific and a dancer wants to be fully developed
 Furthermore, dance dances are no longer made in the hip-hop context only
 The Footworkings is a dance troupe that performs footwork which is a style of house dance and Fanny Pak performs contemporary dance
 haalanki, nrity toliyon main hip-hop adhik prachlit hai, nrity companiyaan sanyukt rajya america or videsh donon main maujuud he

 "street dancing was never ever to a count
 You do not count a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, a 6 to hip hop
 It should be a feeling by making noise like" ou "" ah "" aw "" tsi ", that's how we count, right there
" nrity udyog ne iskaa ek or adhik vyavsaayik sanskaran bana kar hip-hop nrity ke liye pratikriya vyakt kii
 kabhi-kabhi nai style kaha jane vaala yah "studio hip-hop" rap or aar and bi ke adhikansh sangeet video or sangeet samarohon main dekha jaataa he
 hip-hop samskruti main gahare duube kisi vyakti ke drushtikon se, kuch bhi jo hip-hop nrity jaisaa dikhaai de or sadakon se nahin aayaa ho, vah ek sachhee hip hop nrity style nahin he
 dance patrika ke saath ek saakshaatkaar main hip-hop nrity shikshak emilio "buddha stretch" austin, junior bataate hai ki ve ise kaise dekhte hai: Many people echo this sentiment, stage performances may restrict the process of free flowing towards its development that previously defined the development of hip hop dance
 Mixing different dance styles together ends their structure and their identity
 ek takneekee pahalu se, hip-hop nrity kii visheshta he, lacheelaapan or vilgan- sharir ke kisi nishchit hisse ko dusron se alag karnaa, ke saath jor se maarna 
 pair jameen par hai, chaati neeche hoti he or sharir isliye dhilaa rakhaa jaataa he ki ek nartak ko aasaani se hiting beet yaa beet ke madhyam se riding ke bich parivartan kar sake
 yah baile yaa bollroom nrity ke vipareet he, jahaan chaati baahar or sharir kadaa rahata he
 iske alaava, nai style kaa hip-hop bahut talbaddh he or sangitatmakataa par jor rakhaa gaya he - aapaki gati sangeet ke prati kitni samvedansheel he- or free style ke liye sakasham he
 Another genre created by the dance industry is funk jazz
 Jazz funk is a hybrid style of hip-hop and jazz dance
 This style has been used by artists such as Beyoncé
 Although much of it is derived from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a complete hip-hop genre because its basic postures are jazz
 In hip-hop, even vocal hip-hop, there is no pirouette or arbasque and you do not dance on relief
 Although these methods are commonly used in jazz funk and jazz dance
 The dance studio adopted this by hiring technically trained dancers and conducting dance classes of hip-hop and jazz funk
 Large-scale studios around the world that conduct hip-hop and jazz dance classes include - Millennium, Broadway Dance Center, Edge Performing Arts centertur, Pineapple Studios, The Vibe - The International hip-hop Dance Center, Boogizon, Debbie Reynolds, Sunshine Studios, Dream Dance Studio, Once to Watch and KJD Dance Studio

 Lyrical hip-hop is a fluid and more interpretive version of the new genre of hip-hop danced mostly to downtempo rap music or R&B music
 Choreographer Kate Prince describes it as "emotional hip-hop"
 It focuses more on dance and performance and less on freestyles and battles
 Gay Hip Hop gained mainstream and name for the first time in the fourth season of the realty dance competition "so You Think You Can Dance"
 The original word was attributed to the program's judge and choreographer Adam Shankman, who commented in reference to a routine choreographed by Tabitha and Napoleon DUMO for Leona Lewis's "bleeding Love"
 "the great thing about this show is that we've really explored a totally new thing which is lyrical hip-hop and nail it
 This show has shown that hip-hop is just a completely legitimate beautiful genre in and of its own and you can tell such beautiful and heart breaking stories
" Shankman's commentary and his work on seasons 4 and 5 are often attributed to Tabitha and Napoleon for the development of this genre
 According to Dance Spirit magazine what distinguishes lyrical hip-hop from standard new style hip-hop is that dancers interpret beats differently
 kuch hip-hop shuddhtavaadi mahasoos karte hai ki vyaakhyaatmak or naram style kaa matlab he yah hip-hop bilkul nahin he

 Shortly after his birth in the 70s, breaking became a means of entertainment
 The first hip-hop film Wild Style and Beat Street was made in the early 80s
 Wild Style was the first film to focus on hip-hop culture, although Flashdance was the first Hollywood film focused on breaking
 Films released in the 80s such as Breaking and Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo featured funk styles on the big screen
 New Millennium produced films such as The Freshest Kids, Honey, You Got Served, Step Up 2: The Streets, How She Moves, be-girl and Planet be-boy
 Raise, The Hurt of Crump and Shake City 101 are also documentary films released after New Millennium, about crumpling and the street dancers who made it

 So you think you can dance - a reality dance competition like SYTYCD encourages dancers of any background to compete, including hip-hop
 This is similar to the series of music competitions such as American Idol in which auditions are held at the national level to find the next big star
 "bringing these styles together in a competition where there is also ballroom, ballet, and jazz makes it easy to express hip-hop-like dance in a serious way
" In 2008 poppers Robert "mr
 Fantastic" Moren and Philip "packman" Beeb auditioned during the fourth season
 No one got a spot in the finals "top 20" but the judges were so impressed by their performance that they were again invited to take part in the popping battle against each other in the show's live finals
 Dancing to the strong tune of Kanye West, Moren impressed the judges with his fluid mime and perversion style while Beeb quickly influenced the changer styles
 According to Moren, this was the first popping competition that was aired nationally on TV
 After the competition Joshua Allen a hip-hop dancer was declared the winner of the fourth season competition
 The same year mona-janet Bernston, a hip-hop dancer from Norway, was crowned the winner of the first season of So You Think You Can Dance Scandinavia

 Today, hip-hop dance is seen by dancers and trainers as an alternative form of exercise
 hip-hop International is the organization that organizes the United States and the World hip-hop Dance Championships, founded as an assistant to Sports Fitness International
