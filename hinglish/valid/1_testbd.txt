 Gadkari, along with attacking the Left, also said to give Rs 60,000 crore to the state
 darasal desh kii satta par virajman hone ke baad bijepi kaa sabase bada lakshya pashchim bengal or kerala hi hai
 These states are not only politically important for her, but she also wants to establish her base in these states due to ideological enmity with the Left
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ne kerala main puri takat jhonk di he
 The Left parties, which are fighting for Hindu votes, have the basis of Hindu voters while the Congress has a Christian and Muslim base
 bijepi abhi tak kerala main siyaasi jagah banane main safal nahin ho saki he
 But in the changing environment, the bjp's graph has increased in many states of the country, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, bjp's vote in Kerala is 6

 It was done by 45

 'apart from this, Gadkari said to give 60 thousand crores for Kerala
 lekin unhone kin kin pariyojnaon main kharch honge iskaa zikr nahin kiya
 The BJP is trying to identify itself as the main opposition party in Kerala at least till the next assembly elections
 kerala kaa saamaajik swarupakerala ke saamaajik halaat desh ke baaki hisson se ekadam alag hai
 Hindus constitute around 52% of the population in Kerala

 But that was not corrected
 report main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki agar sudhaar nahin hua tha to brij ko roak sakate the
 The bridge on which the guard fell was rusted, which is why the bridge fell down
 jang lagane ke kaaran pul kamjor ho rahaa tha
 On Thursday too, BMC and railway officials started flouting responsibility responsibly soon after the accident took place
 biemasi ke adhikari kah rahe the ki pul railway ke antargat aata he, yahi vajah he ki haadase ko lekar unase hi sawaal kiye jaaen
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis arrived at St
 George's Hospital on Friday morning to meet the injured

 3 women are also among those who died
 jab brij gira tha to vahaan par kai log maujuud the
 Apart from this, many vehicles were also present under the bridge
 isse pehle bhi dilli police ne aise hi giroh ke kai sadasyon ko giraftaar kiya he, jinke paas se police kai hathiyaar mili
 Police is also investigating the involvement of others in the case

 Bali, on the strength of his devotion, took a promise from God to stay in front of him day and night

 Suppose someone is going to be killed and the murderer reaches his victim for killing
 iske baad wo sabase pehle apane shikaar ko khud usee ke katl kaa tarika bataata he
 Not only this, before he is killed, he is sure to rehearse the same thing with his murder and it is amazing that the joy and happiness of the slaughter does everything that tells him to kill
 aakhir main kaatil ke bina haath lagaae sachmuch uskaa katl ho jaataa he
 Such astonishing murder has been done by UP SP leader Sudhir Yadav
 sudhir upi kii sattadhari party sapa kaa pradesh sachiv he
 Sudhir's wife's body hangs from the noose, the stool below her house is dropped on the ground, people are crying
 ye maamla khudakushi kaa nahin balki sidhe katl kaa he
 How would you say that? So listen, this woman may have done the work of hugging death with a noose around her neck, but this death is not at her own will but at the behest of someone else
 yani fanda isane khud ksaa, stool par khud chadhi, phir stool ko bhi khudahi dhakka dekar giraaya
 But he did all this not to die, but to live
 kahani kanpur shahar kii he or is kahani ke chaar kirdaar hai
 One leader, the other his wife, the third girlfriend and the fourth a tantric
 ek taraf bivi jahaan apane shuhar kii mashooqa ko maat dekar pati kaa pyaar dobaaraa hasil karnaa chaahati thi
 At the same time, Mashuka wanted to get her lover's wife out of the way
 donon ek-duusare kii sajeesh se puri tarah anjaan the or isi anjaane main shuru hoti he is haroonges katl kii sajeesh kii shuruyaat
 The foundation of this world's weirdest murder mystery was laid on top of a love triangle ie love triangle
 police kii maane to sudhir kii mulaakaat apane hi mohalle main rahanevaali bank officer rubi se koi chah saal pehle hui thi, lekin jald hi ye aupchaarik mulaakaat, gahari dosti phir muhabbat main tabdeel ho gai
 Now Netaji's eyes were covered
 wo ghar main apni bivi binaa ke saath kam or mashooqa rubi ke saath hi zyaada vaqt gujaarne lage
 It is said that love and love do not hide - the same thing happened with Netaji
 apane shuhar ke ishk ke charche duniyaavaalon kii jubaan se hoti hui sudhir kii patni binaa tak bhi pahunchi or phir jaisaa ki aamtaur par hota he
 The feud between Bina and Sudhir over Ruby started
 ye marz kii dawa ek hi thi, wo ye ki sudhir apni mashooqa rubi se kinaaraa kar len, lekin naa to sudhir ko ye baat manzur thi or naa hi rubi ko
 So, as the time passed, the tension between the three continued to escalate and then the intrigue created by Sudhir's Mashuka Ruby one day after that was horrific
 rubi ne binaa ko raste se hataane ke liye kaale ilm ke maahir ek tantric kaa daaman thama, jisaki shahar main acchhee puch thi
 It was a tantric, Baba Akbar Shah
 baba akbar shaam ko ab rubi kii surat main sone kaa anda denevaali murgi mil chuki thi
 Ruby would often reach him with his plea and Baba used to charge him a hefty amount every time he tried to get him to do Bina's work with the help of tantra-mantra, but when the time was too long, Ruby pressurized Akbar Shah Started and then in the end Akbar Shah took a betel nut from Ruby for his lover's wife i
e
 Bina's murder
 ab baba ne apane sabase bharosemand chele mridul naam ke or tantric ko binaa ko thikaane lagane kaa kaam saunpa, lekin iske liye tantric mridul ko binaa ke ghar daakhil hona tha
 He had to take it in confidence and this is where the real plot of this murder was prepared
 ab rubi apane aashiq sudhir se uske ghar kii har baarik se baarik baaten poochne or samajhane lagi
 For example, what is cooked at home, what is eaten, what is worn, what is the fight, who came, who went
 vagairah-vagairah
 Here, Sudhir would tell these things to Ruby and Ruby all the things to Mridul, but Tantrik Mridul made such an impression on Sudhir's wife Bina's mind that without these small things, she remained absolutely crazy
 ab tantric aksar binaa ke ghar aane laga
 He began to tell her the things she knew about her husband and then made him realize his nervousness through these things, but after this he forced Bina to dance as if at his behest
 darasal, usne binaa se kaha tha ki wo apni tantric shaktiyon kii badaulat uske pati sudhir ko rubi ke changul se waapas khinch laaegaa
 Sudhir will fall in love with her again, but what happened after that, no one thought
 bivi ke katl kii supaari nikal chuki thi, kaatil shikaar ke paas pahunch chukaa tha
 Then came the time when the murderer got his victim to rehearse his murder
 reharsal kaatil ke hisaab se hi puraa hua
 Now just rehearsal had to change the reality and take the final take for it
 final tech yani murder
 Tantrik Mridul had now started coming to Bina often in the absence of Sudhir
 apane pati kaa pyaar waapas paane ke iraade se binaa tab-tab mridul ko apane paas bulaati, jab-jab sudhir ghar main nahin hote or maukey kaa phayda uthaakar mridul ne binaa ke ghar tantra-mantra kaa wo jaal-batta failaayaa, jo lagaataar badhata hi ja rahaa tha
 Mridul had already received orders from his mentor, the great tantric Baba Akbar Shah, to remove Bina from the path, and Mridul was trying to devise an idea that would kill the snake and not even break the sticks, and finally the idea in his mind
 Has arrived
 ab mridul ne sudhir ke dimag main rubi kaa asar kam karne ke naam par binaa ko tantra-mantra ke liye kaha
 He asked Bina to stand on the stool with a noose in the name of tantric actions, and whenever Bina stood up with a noose, he would order Bina to push the stool down
 mridul par binaa ko bharosa ho chukaa tha
 Which would save Bina every time she stopped Bina who dropped the stool from her feet
 is tarah mridul binaa ke katl kaa reharsal kar rahaa tha or binaa ise tantric kriya samaj rahi thi, lekin mridul ke dimag main koi or hi sajeesh chal rahi thi or phir ek din aisa hua, jiske bare main kisi ne bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Mridul once reached Bina's house and in the name of tantric action, he put her on the stool with a noose around her neck
 binaa chadhi or ravaayat ke mutabik usne apane pairon se stool ko neeche bhi gira diya, lekin is baar mridul ne use dhokhaa de diya
 That is, as soon as the stool collapses, as soon as the noose gets stuck in the throat, Mridul retreats
 wo tadapane lagi or chand seconds main hi thandi pad gai or is tarah binaa kaa katl ho chukaa tha
 a murder that happened in front of the murderer's eyes, but the murderer did not even touch Maktool
 pehali najar main to police ne bhi ise khudakushi kaa maamla hi samajha tha, lekin jab tafteesh aage badi or use sudhir or rubi ke rishton kaa pataa chalaa, to sari kahani saaf ho gai
 The call details of the two proved to be an important clue for the police and gradually five people were arrested in the case in the form of Ruby and the tantrik and his disciples
 haalanki is maamle main police ne philhal binaa ke shuhar yani netaji sudhir yadav ko clin chit de rakhi he or ise lekar phija main kai sawaal bhi hai
