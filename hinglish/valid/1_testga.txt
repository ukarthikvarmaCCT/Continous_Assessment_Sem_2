 kavyashastra kavy or sahitya kaa darshan tathaa vigyaan he
 It is a knowledge of theories emerging from time to time based on the analysis of poems
 uganuroop paristhitiyon ke anusaar kavy or sahitya kaa kathy or shilp badalata rahata he; falat: kavyashastreey siddhanton main bhi nirantar parivartan hota rahaa he
 This is illustrated by the historical practice of theories ranging from the principles of Bharata in India to today, and from Socrates and his disciples Plato in the West to the latest "navalochana"
 bharat main kavy naatakadi kritiyon ko 'lakshya granth' tathaa saidhantik granthon ko 'lakshan granth' kaha jaataa he
 These characteristic texts are always retrospective and following the target texts and great poets are seen challenging their rut
 kavyashastra ke liye puraane naam 'sahityashastra' tathaa 'alankarishastra' hai or sahitya ke vyapak rachanaatmak vaaiumay ko sametane par ise 'samikshashastra' bhi kaha jane laga
 Originally poetic thinking is seen to stabilize the theory in relation to the lexicon and the voyeur
 arestu ke "poytics" main kamedi, tragedy, tathaa apik kii samikshatmak kasuti kaa akalan he or bharat kaa naatyashaastra keval roopak yaa drishykavy kii hi samiksha ke siddhant prastut karata he
 This thinking in India and the west BC It is only in the third fourth century that it begins to meet in an adult form, which indicates that discussions about poetry had started many centuries ago
 kavyakruti mulat: tihare aayam se judi he – kavy, kavyakarta, kavyanushilak
 As far as theatrical poetry is concerned, the Natya user Natadi is also included in it along with the poet
 kavyashastreey chintakon kaa dhyaan in sabhi pakshon kii ore sadaa jaataa rahaa he
 The first question that arises in relation to the poet is, what is unique about the poet or artist from other human, preacher, philosopher, scientist, political thinker and why only persons of a particular nature are able to become poets or artists? In other words, what is for poetic power
 sucraat or plato kavitvsakti ko daivi aavesh kii dein maanate hai, adhyayan or abhyaas kaa pratifal nahin
 Poetologists of India consider genius to be predominant in poetry, and do not give any less importance to etymology and practice
 paramparawaadi aalochak keval pratibha ko kavyashakti kaa hetu nahin maanate
 On the other hand, the Romantic thinkers of the West consider the original inspiration of artwork as the only talent
 phir bhi is baat main sabhi chintak ekamat hai ki kavi vishisht pratibhashil vyakti he jo apni pratibha ke madhyam se kavy ke rup main nai sristi kii udbhaavna karata he
 The second important question is, what is the purpose of the poem? Why does a poet of poetry do poetry? There are two groups of thinkers in this regard - the traditionalist thinkers consider the goal or purpose of poetry to be the prestige of moral preaching
 kavy dwaara kavi kinhi mulyon kii sthapana karnaa chahta he, thik usee tarah jaise dharmik upadeshak
 But the difference is that his work becomes distinctive from the scriptures or ethics due to its stylistic delight and delight
 svachhndathawadi chintak ise nahin sweekaarta
 He does not consider the poet a preacher
 uske anusaar kavi sarjak he, srishtikarta he, jo brahma se bhi vishisht he
 He sets before us through his creation, his artwork
 vastut: vah apni anubhutiyon ko kavy ke dwaara vaani dena chahta he
 Poetry is nothing else, the essence of all its sensations and the flow of the swirling emotions in its inner being
 purv or pashchim ke praaia: sabhi matamtantar in do khevon main maje se samete ja sakate hai
 The most important aspect of poetry is the work which, before us, becomes the medium of visual, auditory and intellectual contrivance and through this it affects our mind or nature
 at: kavyashastreey chintan main yah vah pradhan paksh he jiske anek pahaluon ko lekar purv or pashchim ke vichaarak pichley adhaai hajaar varsho se uhapoh karte aa rahe hai
 The first question that arises about the poetry of poetry is how far the events described in the poem match the scientific truth
 yah praaia: sabhi sameekshak sweekaar karte hai ki kavy main tathy-kathan-pranali kaa aashray nahin liya jaataa
 The truth in which it is inaugurated is a probable truth rather than a real truth
 isi aadhaar par kavyavirohi kavi kii kalpana ko bhramit yaa satya se bahut dur ghoshit karte hai
 Plato has proved it to be far from the truth
 bharat ke vichaarkon ne kavyakruti ko bhranti nahin mana hai, yadhyapi ek sthaan par bhatta lollat ne rasasutra kii vyakhya karte hue naatak ke abhinay main ram aadi kaa anukaran karte naton main ram aadi ke bhrantigyaan kaa sanket kiya he
 In the West, in the context of the development of psychology, poetic thinking has strengthened this illusory side
 kaha jaataa he, kala maatr bhranti he 
 Similar to this is another opinion
 kala kuch nahin mahaj sammohan he 
 Here, on the basis of the study of the science of dance, the hypnotic power of poetry is being emphasized and it has emerged that poetry or art has magical effects like the chants of the exorcists of the old primitive society
 yaheen yah sawaal uthta he ki aakhir yah bhranti, sammohan yaa jaadui asar, agar ham puraane vidwaanon ke shabd ko udhaar lenaa chahen to kavy kaa "chamatkaar', kin tatwon ke kaaran paidaa hota he? kavy mulat: bhashaa main nibaddh hota he
 Language is a composite form of word and meaning
 at: pehla sawaal yah uthegaa ki kavy keval shabdamay he yaa shabdarthmay
 Both these views are prevalent with us
 bhamah, kuntak, mammat jaise chintak shabd or arth ke sammilit tatv ko kavy maanate hai, keval shabd ko yaa keval arth ko nahin, kyonki kavy main donon ko ek duusare se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to this view, in order to make poetry wonderful or compelling, the poet will have to give equal emphasis on the elegance of both words and meanings
 doosraa mat kavy kii prabhavanviti main shabd par, arthath uske bauddhik paksh kii apeksha shravan paksh par, adhik jor detaa he
 This is the view of the famous Sanskrit poet Panditraj Jagannath
 yah mat un logon kaa jaan padataa he jo kavy kii lay, shabdachayan, chand or shravan bimbavatta par adhik jor dete hai
 The Romanticist critics of the West, especially the emblematic poets and critics of France, clearly state that poeticism is not made of meaning or thought but by words
 agar is mat kii tulana ham ojhaaon ke nirarthak shabarjaal mantron se karen to pataa chalegaa ki yahan bhi arth kaa koi mahatv nahin, apitu shabdon kii lay, jhaad phunk karanevaale ojha ke mantrocchar kaa lahaza hi rogi ko prabhavit kar manashchikitsa karata kaha jaataa he
 This method is also for psychoanalytic treatment
 kavy ke prabhaav ko paidaa karne main shabd or arth kaa vishesh mahatv mana gaya he, isliye kavyashastreey chintan main shabd or arth ke paraspar sambandh par vichaar karnaa laazmi ho jaataa he
 The word has its intended relation to its traditional meaning
 is sambandh ko hamaare yahan abhidha vyapaar kaha gaya hai
 But in addition to this trade in the language, other trade is also seen to be working, where the word can leave its fixed meaning and also believe in any other meaning related to it, which is known as symptom trade
 arestu ne bhi bhashaa ke in donon vyapaaron kaa vivechan apane prasiddh granth "retorics' main kiya he
 In poetic language, in reality the words are symbolic rather than censorious
 is baat par idhar pashchim main adhikadhik jor diya jane laga he or isaki shuruuaat svachhndathawadi kavi or vichaarak cholorij ne kii thi
 According to him, all poetic language is symbolic
 yah mat ai
e
richards, ampson aadi anya aadhunik kawychintakon ne bhi sweekaar kiya he
 According to this opinion, the images, metaphors, symbols and myths in poetry are all the literary processes of the language and not only that, the purpose of poetry verses, rhythm and vocabulary is also purely symbolic
 is mat se miltaa julata mat hamaare yahan dhvanivaadee kavyashastri kaa he jo kavyarthpratiti main lakshana se bhi ek kadam aage badhkar vyanjana kii pariklpana karte hai or kavy ke samast avyavon ko anubhuti yaa rasaroop vyangy kaa vyanjak maanate hai
 On the other hand, the curvilinear Kuntaka also considers the trade of the word and meaning in poetry not as simple designation, as vichitramidha or curvature and specifies the appropriation of this curvature in the verse like verse, verse, sentence, semantics, management
 kuntak ke is vibhaajan kii mul niv vastut: vaaman ke ritivaadee siddhant par tiki he
 By analyzing the composition or structure of poetry, it combines the compelling elements of the organs that affect the listener or reader
 yah vishleshan ek ore vyakaran or bhashashastra se or duusari or kalashastreey chintan se judaa hua he
 Here, the new poetic review of structuralist method which has taken place in America, took the same approach, which has been initiated by Vamana, Anandvardhan and Kuntak in our own way in relation to the discussion of Sanskrit poetry
 niabandh kii seemaa dekhte hue yahan kavy ke vibhinn angon par samay-samay par hue sabhi vichaaron kaa vivechan karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Poetry has basically two sides
 ek he kathyapaksh, jise ham vishaywastu ke vishesh prakaar ke abhidhaan main or usase abhivyakt kalatmak anubhuti yaa rasadi kii aantarik samvednaa main pate hai
 The second is the stylistic aspect of poetry in which the plan of rhythm, verses, vocabulary, qualities and ornamentation is discussed
 in tatwon par purv or pashchim ke vichaarkon ne vistaar se chintan kiya he
 But it has to be understood here that the effect of poetry is overall
 ye sabhi avyav apane apane dhang se us samgr prabhavanviti main yogadan karte dekhe jate hai
 The rhetorical and orthodox critics here do not accept this overall dominant opinion
 ve kavy kaa saundarya yaa chamatkaar shabd arth ke alankaar main yaa vishisht padrachana main maanate hai
 But from the point of view of curvilinear and soundist influences, they carry the totality of poetry, even if they also analyze the metaphysics of it
 pashchim main paramparawaadi sameekshak isi tarah kavy kii samagrata ko prabhaav kii drushti se nahin aankate or kavy main alankaar, uktivaichitrya, durarudh kalpana ko mahatv dete dekhe jate hai
 There has also been a thinker in the second century of Christ who established the principle of this totality of poetry
 longinus ke udaatt sambandhi siddhant kaa mul bhav yahi he
 The Romantic poets and critics of the West also consider the miracle of poetry in its totality and some of the same conceptions of Hindi's chauvinist and post-chauvinist critics
 hamaare yahan alankaar, reeti, vakrokti, ras, dhwani, auchity, chamatkaar jaise vividh kavyasiddhant jo chal pade the, ve sab mulat: kavy kaa saundarya kis ansh main he, isi aadhaar par hai
 Their special discussion will be unnecessary here
 kavi or kavy ke baad teesraa tatv kavy kaa shrota yaa pathak or naatak kaa darshak he jise dhvanivaadee ke shabdon main sahruday kaha jaataa he
 Sahridaya means a person with the same heart, who becomes engaged in it at the time of poetry, becomes a heart like a poet
 uski yah samanhridayata kavy main varnit vishisht patraadi yaa naikadi se bhi hoti he
 To establish this symmetry, Bhatnayak envisioned a simplification trade that Abhinavagupta has accepted
 bharat ke in rasvaadiyon ke anusaar kavyanushilak ke maanas main raag dweshadi rup raj or tam gunon kaa tirbhaav ho jaataa he tathaa satya ke udrek se man ko vishranti kaa anubhav hota he
 Abhinavagupta considers this situation to be similar to the tomb of the yogis
 pashchim main kavy kii aatma ko ras jaise tatv ke rup main maananevaala koi siddhant udit nahin hua he kintu vahaan pichhali sadi main svachhndathawad ke udai ke kaaran yah siddhant viksit hua he ki kavy kaa shrota yaa pathak kavi yaa kavivarnit paatr ke saath samanubhuti yaa sahanubhuti kaa anubhav karata he, jaisi hamen shakespeare ke hamelet yaa makebeth ke saath tathaa style ke promithus ke saath hoti he
 In our own way, psychological analysis of how we reach the logistics is found with Abhinavgupta
 par vah dhaanchaa maatr he
 More recent psychoanalytic research has thrown more light on this aspect
 manovigyaan kii ek vishesh shakha, jisamen sharirkriya ke aadhaar par hamaare snayucentre ke samuttejan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he or shravan, chakshush, sparshan, ghranaj tathaa rasanaj bimbon kaa athwa unki kalpana maatr kaa hamaare mastishk par kaise prabhaav padataa he or usase hamaara maanas kaise andolit hota he, isapar khojein hui hai or hoti ja rahi hai jo kavy or kalakriti kaa kavyanushilak par kaisaa, kyon or kaise prabhaav padataa he, iske vivechan main vyast hai
 It will be clear from the above discussion how wide the field of poetic thinking has become today
 vah ek ore vyakaran, bhashashastra, kalashaastra, darshan or chhandashastra ke chhoron ko choota he, to duusari ore manovigyaan or sharirkriya vigyaan se bhi ja judaa he
 Not only this, when we also start to pay attention to the historical, social motivations of poetry, then the scope of poetry increases further and it also connects with sociology, history and political thought
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj ke kavyashastreey chintan main kai drushtibhangimaayen milengi

 garudpurana ke mat se yadi maranasann vyakti aatur-sanyas niyamon ke anusaar sanyas grahan kar letaa he, to vah avaagaman se chhutkaaraa paa jaataa he
 Since time immemorial, it has been believed that according to the thoughts that a person has at the time of dying, his soul is insecure after his daily life, so at the time of death one should leave the worldly fascination and remember Hari or Shiva and mind
 The mind should chant 'om Namo Vasudevaya'

 Like this, back to the self-respecting tyjatyante kalevaram

 isi prakaar kii bhaavana prashnopenishad main bhi paayi jaati he
 It has come there that the power of thought keeps the soul higher, so that the human-mind should be aware that all the material substances or manifestations in the whole universe are all one and they have the same variety
 bhagavadgita ne yahi bhaavana or adhik spasht rup se vyakt kii he-'vah vyakti, jo antkaal main mujhe samaran karata hua is jivan se vidaa hota he, vah mere paas aata he, isamen sanshay nahin he'
 But one thing to remember is that nothing will happen in the end only by remembering God, when the soul is overwhelmed with such emotion throughout life, then only God attains God
 aisa kaha gaya he-'vyakti mrityu ke samay jo bhi rup sochataa he, usee ko vah praapt hota he or yah tabhi sambhav he, jabaki vah jivan bhar aisa karata aayaa ho
 ' puraanon ke aadhaar par kuch nibandhon kaa aisa kathan he ki antkaal upasthit hone par vyakti ko, yadi sambhav ho to, kisi tirth-sthaan main le janaa chahie
 Shuddhittattva has quoted the Korampurana - 'A person attains salvation by dying in the waters of the Ganges, in the site or waters of Varanasi, in the Gangasagar or in its land, water or space
 ' isi arth main skandapurana main aayaa he-'ganga ke taton se ek gavyuti tak kshetra hota he, itani dur tak daan, jap evam home karne se ganga kaa hi fal praapt hota he; jo is kshetra main marataa he, vah swarg jaataa he or pun: janm nahin paata'
 He has come to Pujratnakar - 'where the Shalgramshila is there, Hari resides there; One who dies near Shalagramashila receives the supreme sacrifice of Hari
 ' aisa bhi kaha gaya he ki yadi koi anarya desh main bhi shalagram se ek kos kii duuri par marataa he, vah vaikuntha paata he
 Similarly, a person who dies in the forest of Tulsi or at the time of death in whose face Tulsidal gets Mokshapad even after committing crores of sins
 is prakaar kii bhavanaayen aaj bhi lokprasiddh hai

 There are some assumptions about the best period of death
 shaantiparv main aayaa he- 'jo vyakti surya ke uttar disha main jane par marataa he yaa kisi anya shubh nakshatra evam muhoort main marataa he, vah sachmuch punyavan he
 'this sentiment is based on the notion of dying in Uttarayan and Dakshinayan expressed in the Upanishads
 chaandogopenishad main aayaa he- 'ab chaahe log uski antyeshti kriya karen yaa na karen, vah archi: arthath prakaash ko praapt hota he, prakaash se din, din se chandra ke ardh prakaash, usase uttarayan ke chha: maas, usase varsh, varsh se surya, surya se chandra, chandra se vidyut ko praapt hota he
 Amanav leads him to Brahm
 yah devon kaa maarg he; vah maarg, jisase brahm kii prapti hoti he
 Those who go this route do not return to human life again
 haan, ve nahin lautate
 'the same thing has come in the Chandogyopanishad, where it has been said that the householder who knows Panchagni-gya and also the Vanaprastha and Parivrajaka who believe and meditate, also go to Devayana
 or jo log gramvasi hai, yagyaparayan hai, daan-dakshinayukta hai, dhooma ko jate hai, ve dhooma se raatri, raatri se chandra ke ardh andhkaar main, usase dakshinyan ke chha: maas, usase pitrulok, usase akaash evam chandra ko jate hai, jahaan ve karmfal pate hai or pun: usee maarg se laut aate hai
 The Chandogyopanishad has indicated a third place, where insects and kites etc
 keep coming
 brihadaaranyakopenishad ne bhi devloag, pitrulok evam us lok kaa ullekh kiya he, jahaan keet, patang aadi jate hai
 The Bhagavad Gita has also said these words of the Upanishads in a subtle way - i will describe those times when devotees depart from this world to never return
 agni, jyoti, din, shukla paksh, uttarayan surya ke chha:; jab brahmagyani in kaalon main marate hai, to brahmalok jate hai
 Devotees who die in six months of Dhoom, night, Krishna Paksha, Dakshinayan Sun, go to Chandralok and return again
 is vishay main ye do maarg, jo prakaashmaan evam andhakaarmay hai, sanathan hai
 One who returns from one never returns, but one who comes from another returns
 veydantasutra ne 'prakaash', 'din' aadi shabdon ko yathashrut shabdic arth main lene ko nahin kaha he; arthath uske mat se ye margon ke lakshan yaa str nahin hai, pratyut ye un devataaon ke pratik hai, jo mritatmaon ko sahaayta dete hai or devloak evam pitrulok ke margon main unhen le jate hai, arthath ve aativaahik evam abhimaani devtaa hai
 Shankar has explained in the interpretation of Vedantasutra that when Bhishma recited Uttarayana, it should be understood from this that there is only praise for Archiradi - the one who is a Brahmistra, even if he dies in Dakshinayan, he gets the fruit of his knowledge, That is, one attains Brahm
 jab bhishma ne uttarayan kii baat johi to aisa karke unhone keval lokprasiddh prayog yaa aacharan ko manyata di or unhone yah bhi prakat kiya ki unamem yah shakti bhi thi ki ve apni ichhashakti se hi mar sakate hai, kyonki unke pita ne unhen aisa var de rakhaa tha
 Despite the words of Shankar and Vedantasutra, it has been a well-known thing that it is better to die in Uttarayana
 antyeshti ek sanskaar he
 It is one of the sixteen or more rituals performed by the Dwijs and is performed with Vedic mantras by the views of Manu, Yajnavalkyasmriti and Jatukarnya
 ye sanskaar pehle striyon ke liye bhi hote the, kintu bina vaidic mantron ke or shudron ke liye bhi bina vaidic mantron ke
 Baudhayana Pitrimedhasutra states that there are two rites of credit for every human being and they are the birth rites and the deceased rites
 dah sanskaar tathaa shraadh aadi aahitagni evam smartagni ke liye bhinn-bhinn ritiyon se hote hai, tathaa un logon ke liye bhi jo shrout yaa smart koi agni nahin rakhte
 One who is a woman, a child, a parivrajak, one who dies in a distant country, one who dies prematurely or commits suicide or dies accidentally; Funeral acts for them are of different types
 ek hi vishay kii krity-vidhiyon main shrautasutra evam grihyasutra vibhinn baaten kehete hai or aage chalakar madhya evam pashchaatyakalin yugon yugon main vidhiyaan or bhi vistrut hoti chali gayi hai
 Decision Sindhu has clearly stated that, the funeral is mentioned differently in each branch, but some things are same in all branches
 anty-karmon ke vistaar, abhaav evam upasthiti ke aadhaar par sutron, smritiyon, puraanon evam nibandhon ke kaal-kram-sambandhi nishkarsh nikaale gayi hai, kintu ye nishkarsh bahudhaa anumaanon evam vaiyaktik bhaawanaaon par hi aadhaarit hai
 The five Suktas of the Rigveda are translated as follows before the Shrutasutras, Grihyasutras and the later deeds mentioned in the later texts
 in sookhton kii richaayen bahudhaa sabhi sutron dwaara prayukt hui hai or unka prayog aaj bhi antyeshti ke samay hota he or unamem adhikansh vaidic samhitaon main bhi paayi jaati hai
 Indian and Western commentators have interpreted and interpreted these mantras in various ways
 rugveda main pratham sookt kaa varnan is prakaar he- The description of the second sukta in the Rigveda is as follows - rugveda main tritiy sookt kaa varnan is prakaar he- The description of the fourth sukta in the Rigveda is as follows - Except for three to six mantras of this sukta, other mantras do not throw light on the funeral, so we will translate only four mantras
 1, 2
 pratham do mantra twashta kii kanya evam vivasvan ke vivaar evam vivasvan se utpann yama evam yami ke janm kii ore sanket karte hai
 Both are explained in detail in Nirukta
 saraswati kii stuti vaale mantra atharvaveda main bhi paye jate hai
 And in the Kaushikasutra, he is used for funerals with the Atharvaveda

 "sarvavijna pusha, jo pashuon ko nasht nahin hone detaa or vishwa kii raksha karata he, tumhen is lok se bheje
 May he subject you to these fathers and let the fire subordinate you to the Gods who know you
 4
 vah pusha jo is vishwa kaa jivan he, jo swayan jivan he, tumhaari raksha kare
 May those who have gone ahead of you protect you on the way
 savita dev tumhen vahaan pratishthapit kare, jahaan sundar karm karne vaale jaakar nivas karte hai
 5
 Pusha knows all these directions in sequence
 vah hamen us maarg se le chale, jo bhay se rahit he
 He is prosperous, bright, with all the mighty men; That science grew ahead of us without any errors
 6
 pusha margon ke sammukh sthit he, vah swarg ko jane vaale margon or pruthivi ke margon par khadaa he
 He loves us, he is standing in front of both worlds and he keeps on going in both worlds
 " The description of the fifth Sukta in the Rigveda is as follows- yah avlokaneey he ki 'pitru-yajna' shabd rugveda main aayaa he
 What does this mean? We have to remember that the verses of the Rigveda indicate the acts of a person after death
 unka sambandh purvapurushon kii shraadh-kriyaaon se nahin he
 The eagerness to express affection for the immediate martyr must have been expressed to the forefathers, who have been called Barhishads: and Agniswat
 purvapurushon ko 'havi:' diya gaya he or ve use grahan karte hai, aisa pradarshit kiya gaya he
 The purpose of the above mentioned Rigvedic mantras is different from the purpose of the mantras given in the Taittiriya Samhita
 yah baat thik he ki taittiriya samhita ke teen mantra rugveda ke hai or ve pind-pitruyajna main prayukt hote hai
 But there is no argument to say that the Rigveda's 'pitra Yajna' is more ancient than pind-pitragya
 yah sambhav he ki ye donon vibhinn baton kii ore sanket karte hue samakalik prachlan ke hi dyotak hon
 The acts which took place after the death of the person initiated for the Somayagya or session are described in the Assavalayana Srutasutra
 isamen aayaa he-"jab dikshit mar jaataa he, to uske sharir ko ve tirth se le jate hai, use us sthaan par rakhte hai, jahaan avbhruth hone vaala tha or use un alankaranon se sajaate hai, jo bahudhaa shav par rakhe jate hai
 They cut the head, face and body hair and nails of the body
 ve nald kaa lep lagaate hai or shav par naldon kaa haar chadhaate hai
 Some people cut the intestines and remove stool from them and fill the background with them
 ve shav ke paanv ke baraabar naveen vastra kaa ek tukdaa kaat lete hai or usase shav ko is prakaar dhank dete hai ki anchal pashchim disha main pad jaataa he or shav ke paanv khule rahete hai
 Son, etc
 take the price of a piece of cloth
 shav ke vastra ko 'shav vastram' yaa 'shav aachhadanam' kehete hai jise bolchaal kii bhashaa main 'kafan' kehete hai
 The dead fire of the dead is placed on the aranis, the dead body is brought out of the altar and taken to the south, fire is produced by friction and the body is burnt in it
 shmashaan se lautne par unhen din kaa kaary samaapt karnaa chahie
 On the second morning, recitation of weapons, singing of hymns and singing of prostrations is done without repeating and without chanting 'him'
 usee din purohit log grahon ko lene ke purv tirthon se aate hai, daahine haath ko unchaa karke shmashaan kii parikrama karte hai or nimna prakaar se uske chaturdik baith jate hai; hota shmashaan ke pashchim main, adhvaryu uttar main, adgaata adhvaryu ke pashchim or brahma dakshin main
 After this, sing the mantra starting with 'aayin Gau: Pashishnirakramit' in a slow voice
 gayan samaapt hone ke uparant hota apane baayen haath ko shmashaan kii ore karke shmashaan kii teen parikrama karata he or bina 'om' kaa uccharan kiye udgaata ke gayan turant pashchaat dhimen swar main stotriy kaa paath karata he or nimna mantron ko, jo yama evam yamyyanon ke mantra hai, kahata he; yatha-rugveda
 They should end with the Rigveda and after that collect the ashes in a pitcher, take the pitcher from the side of the pilgrimage and place it on the pedestal where the dead Yejman used to sit
 shankhayan shrautasutra ne aahitagni kii antyeshti-kriya ke vishay main vistaar ke saath likhaa he
 Katyayana Shrutasutra has said the same things in a nutshell
 katyayan shrautasutra ne kesh evam nakh kaatane evam mel padaarth nikaal dene kii charchaa kii he
 Kaushikasutra and Shankhayana Shrutasutra have also alluded to these things and have added so much that if they cut the bones out of the right side, then they sew them again or they only bathe the body, Cover with a cloth, decorate it, put it on the bed, on which the black antelope rests, place a garland of Nalad on it, and cover it with a new cloth
 satyasarh shrautasutra evam gautamapitrumedhasutra main bhi aisi baaten di hui hai or yah bhi he ki shav ke haath evam pair ke anguthe shwet sutron yaa vastra ke anchal bhaag se band diye jate hai or asandi udumbar lakdi kii bani hoti he
 Kaushikasutra mentions many mantras of the Atharvaveda, which are said to burn the pyre and while offering Hava
 shatapath brahman kaa kathan he ki pathar evam mitti ke bane yajna-paatr kisi brahman ko daan de dene chahie, kintu log mitti ke paatro ko shavvaahan samajhate hai, at: unhen jal main phenk dena chahie
 After removing the vapors of the strings, one should cover the mouth and head of the deceased and while doing this, recite 'agnarvarm'
 pashu ke donon vrikk nikaalkar mrit ke haathon main rakh dene chahie-dahinaa vrikk daahine haath main or bayen baayen haath main-or 'atidrav' kaa keval ek baar paath karnaa chahie
 He places the heart of the animal on the heart of the corpse, with the opinion of some people also holds two pieces of rice or barley flour

 Some memories have written that Ahitagni can perform his Agnihotra even in a widower form and perform Yajnadi by making a wife's gold or Kush statue, as Rama did

 Manusmriti has given some alternative arrangements, such as watering can be done for children with teeth or naming-sanskrit children, ie there can be cremation of such children
 at: do varsh se kam avasthaa ke bacchon kii antyeshti ke vishay main vikalp he, arthath namakaran evam daant nikalne ke uparant aise bachche jalaaye yaa gaade ja sakate hai
 But in doing this it is not necessary to go with all the dead bodies

 swasth vayask manushya ke agnyashay main kuch 10 lakh ilet hote hai jo ki puure ang main faile hue hote hai; inaki kul maatra 1 se 1
5 gram hoti he
 The hormones produced by the islets of Langerhans are secreted directly into the bloodstream by five types of cells
 mooshak ileton main antahsravi koshika upasamucchyon kaa vitaran is prakaar he: It has been found that the cyto-architecture of pancreatic islets differs in different species
 khaastaur par, mooshak ileton main insulin utpaadai beta koshikon kaa bahul hissaa guchchhe ke antarbhag main hota he or ird gird nune maatra main alfaa, delta va peepi koshikaaye hoti hai, jabaki maanviya ileton main puure guchchhe alfaa or beta koshikaaye kaafii aas paas kareebi sambandh main rahati hai
 Islets can affect each other via paracrine and autocrine communication, and beta cells are also electrically connected to other beta cells
 lengrhans ke ilet kii paracrine pratipushti pranali kaa yah dhaanchaa he: The electrical activity of pancreatic cells has been studied by patch clamp techniques and it has been found that the behavior of cells in monolithic islets is quite different from the behavior of dispersed cells
 prakaar 1 madhumeh main lengrhans ke ileton kii beta koshikaaye ek swachaalit pratirodh prakriya ke jariye chun chun ke nasht kar di jaati hai, atah shodhak or nidaankaree sakriy rup se ilet pratiropan ke jariye sharir-kriyaatmak beta koshika kriyakalapon ko punarsthapit karne kii vidhiyaan khoj rahe hai taaki prakaar 1 madhumeh vaale marizon ko raahat mili
 Recent diagnostic experiments have shown that patients with unstable type 1 diabetes have achieved insulin independence and improved metabolic control multiple times through transplantation of islets from deceased donors
 prakaar 1 madhumeh ke liye ilet pratiropan ke liye is samay shashakt pratirodhdman kii zarurat hoti he taaki daanprapt ileton kaa agrahan na ho
 Rachel Harris, islet cell recipient was transplanted at the Mudhumeh Research Institute, Miami, Florida
 miami herold ke anusaar farvari 2004 main rechal sarvaadhik samay tak insulin mukt jivit madhumehi baniin
 Another source of beta cells, such as islets derived from adult stem cells or progenitor cells of a diabetic, may reduce the tightness of donors' organs for transplantation
 punarjanan chikitsa kaa kshetra kaafii tezi se viksit ho rahaa he or nikat bhavishya main kaafii aashaaen de saktaa he
 However, type 1 diabetes is caused by the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the pancreas
 atah ek prabhavi upachaar ke liye krambaddh, samikrut vidhi apnaani hogi jo ki upyukt va surakshit swapratirodhi avrodh or beta koshika punarjanan donon kaa hi khyal rakhe
 Islet cell transplantation is likely to bring back beta cells and treat diabetes, which is another option rather than complete pancreas transplantation or artificial pancreas
 ilinoy vishvavidhyalay ke chicago chikitsa centre main mukhyalayit chicago pariyojna yah koshish kar rahi he ki beta koshikaaon ko "in vivo" hi punarjanit kiya jaae
 It is worth noting that apoptosis occurs early in beta cells and is destroyed in the normally functioning pancreas
 iskaa strot pander, prathit hota he, yah ek jin he jo arene ke saath jud ke kaam karata he
 When activated, the pander blocks beta cells in s phase leading to apoptosis
 is beta koshika kii maatra main ghataav hone se adhikansh pratiropit beta koshikaaye bhi nasht ho jaati hai

 After the defeat in the Seven Years' War, France, in retaliation, made a treaty with this new nation in 1778, which ultimately proved decisive for victory
 america ke swatantraaa yuddh ne europea upniveshwaad ke itihaas main ek nayaa mode laa diya
 He devised a method for the future independence of the states of Africa, Asia and Latin America
 is prakaar america ke yuddh kaa parinaam keval itnaa hi nahin hua ki 13 upnivesh matrudesh britain se alag ho gaye balki ve upnivesh ek tarah se nae raajnneetik vichaaron tathaa sansthaaon kii prayogshaala ban gaye
 First conquered by challenging the 16th-17th century European colonialism and commercialism
 america upniveshon kaa england ke aadhipaty se mukti ke liye sangharsh, itihaas ke anya sangharshon se bhinn tha
 This struggle was neither the result of dissatisfaction caused by poverty nor the people were suffering from feudal system
 america upniveshon ne apni svachhndatha or vyavhaar main swatantraaa banaae rakhane ke liye england sarkaar kii kathor aupniveshik niti ke viruddh sangharsh kiya tha
 America's freedom struggle is an important event in world history
 england evam spain ke madhya 1588 i
 main bheeshan nausainik yuddh hua jisamen spain kii paraajay hui or isi ke saath british nausainik shreshthata kii sthapana hui or england ne america main apni aupniveshik bastiyaan basaai
 By 1775 AD, 13 British colonies had been settled in America
 in america upniveshon ko bhugolic drushti se teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he- These colonies were 90% English and 10% Dutch, German, French, Portuguese etc
 is tarah america upnivesh pashchimi duniya tathaa nai duniya donon kaa hissaa tha
 In fact, part of the Western world came because the people who came here came from different regions of Europe such as Britain, Germany, France, Ireland etc
 and were also part of the New World because the religious, social environment and surroundings were different from there
 ek prakaar se yahaan mishrit samskruti kaa janm hua kyonki bhinn-bhinn kshetron se aae logon ke apane reeti-rivaaj, dharmik vishwaas, shashan-sanghathan, rahan-sahan aadi ke bhinn-bhinn saadhan the
 Despite these differences, there was unity among them and this unity was born due to common problems and as a result of efforts to solve it
 itnaa hi nahin balki pashchim se logon kaa teji se aagaman bhi hua or is ki vajah se loktantric samaaj ke nirmaan kii bhaavana kaa bhi prasar hua
 America's freedom struggle was primarily a struggle for economic interests between Great Britain and its colonies, but in many ways it was also a rebellion against the social and political system whose usefulness in America was never ending
 duusare shabdon main kaha ja saktaa he ki america kranti ek hi saath aarthik, raajnneetik, saamaajik evam dharmik anek shaktiyon kaa parinaam thi
 The immigrants who immigrated to the United States were far more independent lovers than the citizens of England
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki yahaan kaa samaaj europe kii tulana main kahin adhik samtawadi tha
 The special feature of American society was feudalism and the absence of unbreakable class boundaries
 america samaaj main ucchvarg ke paas raajnneetik evam aarthik shakti british samaaj kii tulana main atyant kam thi
 In fact, most of the peasants in the US had land whereas in Britain there were more number of marginal tenants and landless agricultural laborers
 nae mahadweep par pair rakhane ke saath hi apravasi british kanoon evam samvidhan ke anusaar kaary karne lage the
 They had their own political institutions
 is prakaar america upniveshon main aarambh se hi swashaasan kii vyavastha vidyaman thi jo samay ke saath viksit hoti gai
 The British government used to appoint governors to govern colonial rule and to provide aid there was an executive committee whose members were nominated by the British crown
 iske atirikt shashan kaary main sahaayta dene ke liye ek vidhayak sadan / essembali hoti thi jisamen janata ke dwaara nirvaachit pratinidhi hote the
 This legislative house was empowered to impose taxes, fix the salaries of officers, enact laws
 kintu kanoonon ko sweekaar karnaa athwa radd karne kaa purna adhikaar governor ko tha
 This system created discontent among the people of the colonies
 england ne aarambh main hi upniveshon kii svachhndatha va swashaasan par ankush lagane kaa praytn nahin kiya kyonki england main 17veen sadi ke aarambh se lekar “raktahin kranti” tak ke lagbhag 85 varshon ke bich rajtantr evam sansad ke bich nirantar sangharsh chal rahaa tha
 Then when the government tried to collect them strictly by levying various taxes, discontent arose in the colonies and this dissatisfaction turned into a revolution
 uttari america main quebec se lekar mississippi ghati tak francisi upnivesh faile hue the
 Britain and France had interests in the region
 faltah 1756-63 ke bich donon ke madhya saptavarshiya yuddh hua or isamen england vijayi rahaa tathaa canada sthit francisi upniveshon par angrejon kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 As a result of this war, the French threat from the north ended in America
 atah upniveshvayi kii england par nirbharta samaapt ho gai
 Now he got an opportunity to revolt against Britain
 doosraa prabhaav yah rahaa ki england ne uttari america main mississippi nadi se lekar algaani parvatamala tak ve vyapak kshetra ko apane niyantran main le liya
 As a result, the residents of the American colony now wanted to expand their boundaries towards the western and the natives living in this area wanted to drive away the Red Indians
 faltah vahaan sangharsh hua
 So the Government of England secured the territories of Florida, Mississippi, etc
 for the Red Indians by a royal proclamation in 1763
 isse upniveshavaasiyon kaa pashchimi kii ore prasar ruuk gaya or ve england kii sarkaar ko apana shatru samajhane lage
 In addition, during the Seven Year War, England had to spend a large amount of money, causing England to face economic problems
 angrej raajnneetigyon kaa maananaa tha ki england ne upniveshon kii raksha hetu dhan kharch kiya he isliye upniveshon ko england ko or adhik kar dene chahie
 This is the reason that the already applicable shipping laws, commercial laws, sugar act etc
 were strictly enforced
 parantu upniveshvasi us sthiti ke bhugtan ke liye taiyaar na the
 Thus the Seven Year War played a major role in the herald of the American freedom struggle
 england dwaara upniveshon kaa aarthik shoshan, upniveshon or matrudesh ke bich asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran tha
 According to the prevailing commercialist theory, England wanted to control the trade of the colonies and monopolize their markets
 “upnivesh england ko laabh pahuchane ke liye hai” is siddhanth par upniveshon kii vyavastha aadhaarit thi
 England enacted laws keeping in mind its benefits- nausanchaalan kanoon : 1651 i
 ke praavdhaan ke anusaar upniveshon main vyapaar keval england, ireland yaa upniveshon ke jahaajon ke madhyam se hi ho saktaa tha
 It was then arranged that all the raw materials needed for England should not be exported from the colonies to other places without bringing them to the ports of England
 isse england ke pot nirnaat udyog ko to laabh hua hi england ke vyapaariyon ko bhi mila 1663 ke kanoon ke tahat kaha gaya ki europe se america upniveshon main niryaat kiya jane vaala maal pehle england ke bandargahon par laayaa jayega
 This law benefited the merchants of England and the owners of merchant beds at the expense of the American consumer
 ye kanoon upniveshavaasiyon ke liye anyaaypurna the
 Business Act: England enacted a law that goods produced in America such as rice, iron, wood, tobacco etc
 could only be exported to England
 in niyamon se upniveshon main kaaphi rosh failaa
 Because the French and Dutch merchants were willing to pay them more than the English for these goods
 audyogic adhinium : england ne kanoon banaaya ki jis audyogic maal ko england main taiyaar kiya jaataa tha vahi maal uske america upnivesh taiyaar nahin kar sake
 Thus the export of woolen goods from the colonies by the law of 1689 and the hats by the law of 1732 AD was stopped
 uparokt kanoon yadhyapi upniveshon ke liye hanikaarak the phir bhi upniveshon ne inkaa virodh nahin kiya kyonki inako sakhti se lagu nahin kiya jaataa tha
 Further, when these were strictly enforced during the reign of George III, the colonies opposed them
 america main jivan ke sthayitv ke saath hi shiksha or patrakarita kaa vikaas hua jisane bauddhik chetana ke vikaas main apana yogadan diya
 Many American intellectual thinkers such as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Wilson, John Adams, Tomas Penn, James Otis, Samuel Adams etc
 justified the colonies' resistance to the homeland
 inke vichaar jon lock, montescue jaise chintakon se prabhavit the
 But these views were expressed so strongly that it bolstered the American people's demand for self-government
 britain ne america upnivesh main kai prakaar ke kar-kanoon lagu kar sthaneey karon ko badhaane kaa praytn kiya
 This also led to a feeling of great dissatisfaction in the colony
 yahaan ek sanvaidhanik mudda bhi uth khadaa hua
 The British believed that the British Parliament was the supreme power and could pass any kind of law in the case of its American colony
 jabaki america upniveshon kaa maananaa tha ki un par kar lagane kaa adhikaar keval upniveshon kii essembliyon main nihit he na ki british parliament main kyonki usamen pratinidhitiv nahin he
 Lord North's tea policy, in 1773 AD, the British Prime Minister Lord North enacted a law that the company could sell tea directly to the United States in order to rescue the East India Company from financial crisis
 ab pehle kii bhaanti company ke jahaajon ko england ke bandargahon par aane or chungi dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 The goal of this move was to save the company from losses and make tea available to the American people
 parantu america upnivesh ke log company ke is ekadhikaar se aprasann the kyonki upnivesh bastiyon kii sahmati ke bina hi aisa niyam banaaya gaya tha
 Therefore, this tea policy was strongly opposed in the colony and it was said that England wanted to retain its right to levy external tax through "cheap tea"
 atah puure desh main chaay yojana ke viruddh andolan shuru ho gaya
 On 16 December 73, under the leadership of Samuel Adams, the East India Company's ship at Boston port was dumped into the sea of loaded tea boxes
 america itihaas main is ghatana ko boston tii party kaha jaataa he
 The incident posed a stiff challenge before the British Parliament
 atah british sarkaar ne america upniveshavaasiyon ko sajaa dene ke liye kathor evam damankaaree kanoon banaae
 The port of Boston was closed
 mesachusets kii sarkaar ko punargathit kiya gaya or governor kii shakti ko badha diya gaya tathaa sainikon ko nagar main rahane kaa niyam banaaya gaya or hatya sambandhi mukademen america nyaayalayon se england tathaa anya upniveshon main sthanantarit kar die gaye
 Britain was considered an invincible nation
 america upniveshon ke haathon uski haar ascharyajanak thi
 It is true that Americans had no existence before English
 phir bhi america kii vijay hui
 The role of "nature, France and George Washington" was important, with many reasons behind it
 aadhunik maanav kii pragati main america kii kranti ko ek mahatvapurn mode mana ja saktaa he
 As a result of this revolution, in the new world not only a new nation was born but a new era was heralded in terms of mankind
 pro
 green kaa kathan he ki “america ke swatantraaa yuddh kaa mahatv england ke liye chaahe kuch bhi kyon na ho parantu vishwa itihaas main yah ek mahatvapurn ghatana he
 "this revolution also had an impact on other countries including America, England
 1
 george tritiy ke vyaktigat shashan kaa ant : england main george tritiy evam pradhanmantri lord north donon kii ninda hone lagi
 Both of them were held responsible for the chaos of England
 chunki george tritiy sansad ko apni kathputli maanata tha, atah sansad kii shakti main vruddhi kii maang uthi
 The revolution struck a monarchy based on the divine authority of the king and passed a resolution restricting the king's authority in the House of Commons and Lord North had to resign as prime minister
 isse george tritiy ke vyaktigat shashan kaa ant ho gaya
 Further new Prime Minister Pitt Jr
 reestablished the power of the cabinet
 is tarah england main vaidhanik vikaas kaa maarg prashast hua

 Establishment of new colonies by England: The independence of 13 American colonies hurt England's colonial empire
 apni khoi pratishtha ko punah praapt karne evam vyapaarik hiton ko surakshit karne hetu nae kshetron main upniveshikaran kaa prayaas kiya or isi sandarbh main austrailia tathaa newjiland main british upnivesh kii sthapana hui
 3
 Changes in the colonial policy of England: With the withdrawal of the American colony, the British government realized that if the remaining colonies were to be kept under their control then they should leave the policy of colonial exploitation and the rights of the people of the colonies and Demands have to be respected
 is parivartit niti ke aadhaar par hi 19veen evam 20veen shatabdi main british sarkaar ne “british kamanvelth of neshns” arthath british raashtra mandal kii sthapana kii
 4
 The abandonment of the commercialist principle by England: After the colonies were taken away, many people believed that this would give a tremendous blow to the trade commerce of England
 parantu kuch varshon baad england or sanyukt rajya america main pehle se bhi adhik vyapaar hone laga to adhikansh deshon kaa “vaanijya siddhanth” se vishwaas uth gaya
 England itself abandoned this policy and adopted a policy of free trade
 vastutah francisi kranti ke mukhya siddhanth swatantraaa, samanta evam bandhutav kaa mul america sangharsh main dekha ja saktaa he
 The American Revolution had its impact on Ireland and, in part, India
 us samay ireland ke log bhi england ke log bhi england ke viruddh apni swatantraaa ke liye lard rahe the
 The American Revolution gave him freedom
 america naaraa pratinidhitiv nahin to kar nahi ireland main atyadhik lokapriy hua falswaroop 1782 i
 main british sarkaar ne ireland kii sansad ko vidhi nirmaan kaa adhikaar de diya
 The American Revolution adversely affected India
 america swatantraaa sangram ke kaal main france ke yuddh main pravesh hone se bharat main bhi angl-francisi yuddh kii sthiti utpann ho gai
 By taking advantage of this, the British made the path of expansion of their empire accessible by damaging the power of the French
 ek duusare tareeke se bhi america kranti kaa prabhaav bharat par dekha ja saktaa he
 In fact, one of the reasons for the American Revolution was that the British did not interfere effectively in the rule of the American colonies
 faltah america upniveshavaasiyon main swatantry chetana evam swashaasan kii paddati kaa vikaas ho gaya
 Discontent arose when the British intervened there
 atah britain ne is sthiti se sikh lekar bhartiya upnivesh ke aantarik maamalon main aarambhik charan se sakriy hastkshep jari rakhaa or vahaan ke nivaasiyon kii swatantraaa ko simit rakhaa
 The British intervened in the internal affairs of India through subsidiary treaties and merger policy and Indian classes were kept separate by adopting a policy of divide and rule
 is tarah america sthitiyon se sikh lete hue bharat main un sthitiyaan ko utpann kiya gaya jisase log bante rahe or aupniveshak samrajya par british samrajya kii pakad bani rahe
 In this way, we can say that the American Independence War deprived Britain of an empire but strengthened the foundations of each other's empire
 america swatantraaa sangram ko do charnon main baantkar dekha ja saktaa he- pratham charan 1762-72 kaa kaal, krantikari andolan kaa kaal rahaa or is kaal main aupniveshik shoshan ke viruddh aawaaj uthaai gai tathaa british samrajya ke andar hi aantarik sudhaaron par bal diya gaya
 But when this attempt failed, then the second phase begins after 1772, which was the phase of freedom struggle
 is charan main america netaaon ne keval kar lagane ke adhikaar ko hi chunauti nahin di balki yah ghoshit kiya ki british samrajya khud hi ek mukhya samasya he or usase mukti hi ekmaatr rasta he
 Thus the process of American freedom struggle started with the revolution and culminated in the freedom struggle
 ise kranti isliye kaha jaataa he ki sampoorn aadhunik vishwa itihaas ke sandarbh main raajnneetik, saamaajik or vaicharik pahaluon par amul-chul parivartan laayaa gaya
 The American middle class was extremely liberal, progressive and aware
 is varg ne upniveshi shaskaon ke visheshadhikaron ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai or kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 Leaders like Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, James Otis represented the middle class
 vaicharik aadhaar par ladi gai is kranti main madhyavargeey mudde pramukhataa liye hue the
 Such as no representation, no tax, franchise demand, demand for independence, etc
 swatantraaa ke ghoshnaa patr par hastakshar karne waalon main madhyavarg hi pramukh tha
 In the American Revolution there was also a put of class struggle in which on one side was the elite ruling class of England, in support of which there were American rich and oligarchs who were afraid of the arrival of democracy and its reactions
 duusari taraf america ke karigar, shilpi, shramik, madhya varg ke log the jo america swatantraaa sangram ke pakshdhar the
 The revolution took a progressive form, the expression of which can be seen in its system of governance and constitution
 jisamen ganatantrwaad, samvidhanwaad, dharmanirpekshata, loktantric mulyon kii sthapana par bal diya gaya tha
 The revolution hit colonial principles and encouraged the creation of an independent nation
 america kranti main striyon ne bhi bad-chadh kar bhaag liya
 Worked as an undercover, collaborated with weapons manufacturing
 kranti main mahilaon kii bhagidaari dekh cornwalis ne kaha bhi- yadi ham log uttari america ke sabhi purushon ko khatm bhi kar de to bhi auraton ko jeetne ke liye hamen kaaphi ladanaa padegaa
 The period before the post-vedic period in which the Rigveda's verses were composed, the language of these verses was called the Rigvedic language
 rigvaidic bhashaa hind europea bhashaa parivaar kii ek bhashaa he
 Its later daughter languages are Avesta Old Persian Pali Prakrit and Sanskrit
 rigvaidic bhashaa ke mul maatrubhaashi hind-irani arya the
 Just like Homeric Greek is different from classical Greek, Rigvedic language is different from Sanskrit language
 tiwari ne donon ke bich antar ko nimna siddhant swaroop suchit kiya: In the 19th century, Western scholars had a new look at both the Avastai Persian and the Rigvedic language, and the fact of their deep association was soon revealed to them

 In his book "comparison of Avastai Grammar with Sanskrit and the Avastai Alphabet and its Transliteration" published in 1892, the linguist and scholar Abraham Jackson, for example, directly translated an Avastai religious verse into the Rigvedic language

 The ideology of scientific socialism propounded by Marx embodied the Russian Revolution for the first time
 is kranti ne samaajawaadee vyavastha ko sthapit kar swayan ko is vyavastha ke janak ke rup main sthapit kiya
 This ideology became so powerful after 1917 that by 1950 almost half of the world had come under it
 kranti ke baad kaa vishwa itihaas kuch is tareeke se gatisheel hua ki yaa to vah iske prasar ke paksh main tha athwa iske prasar ke viruddh
 The importance of Russia's revolution lies not only in the history of Europe, but in the history of the world

 Due to work in it, millions of workers abandoned the countryside and villages and started living in the cities and cities in which factories were established yesterday

 By becoming familiar with their political rights, the people of Russia understood that a completely democratic regime should be established in Russia, where the rule of power is in the hands of ordinary people

 17 farvari 2009 ko, GSM association ne ghoshnaa kari ki ve mobile phone ke liye ek maanak charger par sahamat hue hai
 The standard charger adopted by the 17 manufacturers, including Nokia, Samsung and Motorola, should be the micro USB connector

 Mobile phone manufacturers, including solar cells, are experimenting on alternative sources of energy
 bydaree ke alaava, GSM mobile phone ko kaam karne ke liye ek choti si microchip kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jise graahak pahchaan maapdand yaa sim card kaha jaataa he
 The SIM card of approximately a postage stamp size is usually placed at the back of the unit under the battery and stores the configuration data and information about the phone, such as which call scheme the user is using
 jab graahak sim card ko hataa detaa he, to ise pun: duusare phone main daal kar saamaanya rup se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Each SIM card is activated by the use of a unique numeric identifier; Once activated, the identifier is localized and the card is permanently clad in the active network
 is kaaran se, adhikansh khudara vikreta ek sakriy kiye gaye sim card ko vaapis lene se inkaar kar dete hai
 Cell phones that do not use a SIM card have data programmed into their memory
 ek vishesh aankik kram kaa upyog karke is data kaa upyog kiya jaataa he he, "NAM" ko "naam" yaa number kramadesh suchi ke rup main upyog karne ke liye
 From here, one can get any information such as a number for your phone, new service provider number, new emergency number, change of their authentication key or A-key code and list or perl to rotate their favorites
 However, to prevent someone from accidentally deactivating their phone or deleting it from the network, service providers use a master assistant shut down or MSL on this data
 MSL yah sunishchit karata he ki seva pradaata khride gaye yaa patte par liye gaye phone ke liye bhugtan praapt karen
 For example, the Motorola RAZR V9C costs more than CAD $ 500
 lagbhag $200 main, vaahak ke aadhaar par, aapako ek mil sakati he
 The difference is paid by the customer as a monthly bill
 yadi graahak ne ek MSL kaa upyog nahin kiya, to ve $300 - $400 kaa antar kho denge jo unke masik bill main bhugtan kiya jaataa he, kyunki kuch graahak maujuuda seva ko radd karke duusare vaahak ke paas phone le jate hai
 The MSL applies to the SIM only because once the contract is completed, the MSL still applies to the SIM
 phone haalanki, shuru main bhi seva pradaata MSL main nirmaataa dwaara band kiya jaataa he
 This lock can be disabled so that this phone can use another service provider's SIM card
 america ke baahar kharide gaye phone khule phone hai kyonki vahaan zyaadaatar phone ek duusare ke nikatataa main kai seva pradaata yaa ativyapee vyapti he
 The cost of unlocking a phone varies but is usually very inexpensive and sometimes provided by independent phone vendors
 saamaanya vyapti kshetra ke baahar MSL seva pradaata ke upyog main ucch laagat kii vajah se ek khulaa phone yatriyon ke liye behad upyogi hota he
 This can sometimes be 10 times the price of using a closed phone as a foreigner in the general service area, even with discounted rates

 udhaaharan ke liye, jamaika main, ek AT&T graahak bhunaai antarrashtriya seva ke liye $1
65 prati minute kaa atirikt bhugtan kar saktaa he jabaki ek B-mobile graahak ko samaan antarrashtriya seva ke liye $0
20 prati minute kaa bhugtan karnaa padegaa
kuch seva pradaata apane bikri ko antarrashtriya bikri par kendrit karte hai jabaki kuch kshetreey bikri par kendrit karte hai
 For example, the same b-mobile customer will pay less on local calls but more on international calls than in Jamaica's national phone C&W company
 yah mulya antar mukhyatah mudra parivartan ke kaaran hota he kyonki sim kii kharid sthaneey mudra main hoti he
