 = The internal rate of return or internal rate of return is used to measure and compare the return on investment in a capital budget, which is also called the money flow discount rate of return, or simply the rate of return
 bachat or rin ke sandarbh main iiar ko prabhavi byaaj dar bhi kaha jaataa he
 The term internal refers to the fact that its calculation does not include environmental factors
 aatanrik pratifal dar par nivesh yaa sambhavit nivesh, vaarshik prabhavi jatil pratifal dar he
 This rate can be earned by investing capital
 adhik parichit shabdon main, ek nivesh kaa IRR wo byaaj dar he jisapar nivesh kii laagat nivesh kaa laabh detii he
 This means that all the profits from the investment are inherent to the time value of the money and that is why the net present value of the investment at this interest rate is zero
 kyonki aantarik pratifal dar ek parimaap dar he, yah kaary kushalta, gunvattta yaa nivesh kii aay kaa suchak he
 This is the exact opposite of net present value
 ye nivesh ke mulya yaa pariman kaa sanket he
 An investment is considered acceptable if its internal rate of return exceeds a minimum acceptable rate of return
 ek paridrishy main jahaan nivesh kisi ek aisi company jinke paas share dharak hote hai, unke dwaara nirdhaarit kiye jate hai
 This minimum rate is the cost of capital invested

 The internal rate of return, as a function of the rate of return, follows it according to the net present value

 In the given pairs where n { \ displaystyle n} n is a positive integer, the total number of times n { \ displaystyle N} n and the net present value of NPV { \ displaystyle { \ mbox {NPV}}} \ mbox {NPV} , r { \ displaystyle r} is the internal rate of return given by r: NPV = ∑ n = 0 n c n n = 0 { \ displaystyle { \ mbox{npv}}= \ sum _{n=0}^{n}{ \ frac {c_{n}}{^{n}}}=0} Note that periods are usually given in years, but calculations can be made easier if r { \ displaystyle r} r is calculating using periods in which most problems are defined
 And after that replace them annually
 dhyaan den ki kisi bhi nishchit samay ko vartmaan samay ke badale istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The value obtained will be zero only when NVP is zero
 aise maamalon main jahaan poonji pravaah bahut zyada aniyamit rup se parivarti hote hai, jaise ki jivan varshiki ke maamle main upar die gaye formule main ummid kiye gaye mulyon ko daalaa jaataa he
 At most, the value of r { \ displaystyle r} cannot be found in an analytical way

 If investment capital can be given by order of flow, then to IRR main r { \ displaystyle r} iske dwaara diya jaataa he NPV = - 100 + 40 1 + 59 2 + 55 3 + 20 4 = 0 { \ displaystyle { \ mbox {NPV}} = - 100 + { \ frac {40} {^ {1}}} + { \ frac { 59} {^ {2}}} + { \ frac {55} {^ {3}}} + { \ frac {20} {^ {4}}} = 0} is maamle main, uttar 29% he
 As mentioned above, a common way to remove the criterion of the publication root is NPV { \ displaystyle { \ mbox {NPV}}} \ mbox {NPV}, in addition there are many more ways to extract r { \ displaystyle r} r
 Huh
 udhaaharan ke liye, chhedak vidhi kaa prayog kar r { \ displaystyle r} dwaara diya jaataa he rn + 1 = rn - NPV n NPV n - NPV n - 1) { \ displaystyle r_ {n + 1} = r_ {n} - { \ mbox {NPV}} _ {n} \ left} {{ \ mbox { NPV}} _ {n} - { \ mbox {NPV}} _ {n-1}}} \ right)} jahaan r n { \ displaystyle r_{n}} ko IRR ke th nikataagaman n { \ displaystyle n} mana jaataa he
 The introduction of this formula requires two unique pairs to compute IRR and NPV { \ displaystyle} and { \ displaystyle} and make its sequence , , 


, ,, { \ displaystyle ,, \ dots ,,,} Which may be oriented towards n → ∞ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle n \ to \ infty} \ scriptstyle n \ to \ infty in { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle} scriptstyle
 yadi anukram abhimukhit hota he, to formula ke punaruktiyaan anishchit kaal tak jari rah sakati hai taaki r { \ displaystyle r} ko sateekta kii swecchit degree par paaya ja sake
 The convergence behavior of the sequence is governed by the following: jab NPV { \ displaystyle { \ mbox{npv}}} \ mbox{npv}_{0} ho to ye hoga r 1 > r 0 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle {r_{1}>r_{0}}} \ scriptstyle{r_1 \ mbox{npv}_{0} yaa jab NPV 0 { \ displaystyle { \ mbox{npv}}_{0}} \ mbox{npv}_{0} ye ho to ye hoga pars nahin kar paye : { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle{r_1 } \ scriptstyle{r_1 ye abhisaran kii gati ko {5 / }r_n se r { \ displaystyle r} r tak badhaa sakati he Numerical iterations can be heavy and easily disabled

 lekin uskaa prayog keval kisi pariyojna ke mahatta ko is aadhaar par tolane kaa hona chahie ki wo pariyojna nivesh karne ke liye kitni upyogi he
 In cases where a project whose initial investment is higher than another mutually exclusive project

 When the calculated IRR is different from the actual reinvestment rate for the interim cash flow, the annual equivalent return will reflect the assessment more accurately
 The company may have additional projects that are exactly the same for investing interim cash flow
 May have attractive expectations ye iiar ko udhyam puunji ke aankalan or anya nijee equity nivesh ke liye upyukt banaata he
 Such strategies usually require a lot of cash investment during the entire project
 lekin ant main ye keval ek hi nakadi bahirpravaah ko dekhati he Since IRR does not consider the cost of capital, it should not be used to compare projects with different periods

 This example applies when a customer makes a deposit before making a specific machine
 nakadi pravaah kii shrinkhalaa main, jaise ki ek shuruuaati nivesh kii gayi dhan raashi, isliye adhik dar vaala pratifal sabase acha hota he, lekin phir usapar ek se adhik logon kaa adhikaar hota he
 So one is indebted to someone else's money, so now low rate returns are the best
 is maamle main ye baat spasht nahin he ki adhik IRR behatar he yaa kam irr
ek pariyojna main anekon IRR ho sakate hai, jaisaa kii udahaaran main 0% bhi he or 10% bhi he
 Examples of such projects are block mines and nuclear power plants, where there is usually a large cash outflow at the end of the project
 saamanytah, IRR kii gananaa bahupad samikar ko hal karke kiya ja saktaa he
 If there is a truly unique solution to the equation, the Starm formula can then be used
 saamanytah IRR sameekaran kaa vishleshnatmak tareeke se hal nahin dhundha ja saktaa he lekin isko punraritiya ke tareeke se hal kiya ja saktaa he
 When a project has multiple irrs, it can be even easier to calculate the project with the benefit of its reinvestment, according to the MIRR, which has an estimated reinvestment rate, usually this rate is equal to the cost of the project
 Is equal
 en pi ve kii majboot shaikshik pasand ke baavjood, surveykshanon se sanket miltaa he ki adhikari IRR ko NPV kii jagah zyada mahatv dete hai
 Generally, managers find it easier to compare investments of different sizes, if they are about the percentage of return rate from dollars of NPV
 However, NPV is still "more accurate" in terms of trade value
 ek nivesh kushalta ke parimaap ke rup main, IRR, poonji niyantran karne jaisi halaaton main behatar antardrushti rakhata he
 However, when comparing mutually specific projects, NPV is the appropriate measure
 ganitiya nivesh ke mulya main vaapasi kii kuch dar ke hisaab se guzarana laga, ganit ke anusaar nivesh ke mulya kaa upyog kuch pratifal daron ke anusaar ghaateey vruddhi yaa kshay kaa anumaan lagane ke liye kiya jaataa he 
 yah anumaan nakadi pravaah asatatyata ke saath chalati he or kisi shrinkhalaa kii nakadi pravaah kii IRR ko kisi bhi tarah kaa pratifal dar jiskaa parinaam shunaya shuddh vartmaan mulya ho ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai
 Thus the internal rate or rates follow the net present value as a function of the rate of return
 is prakriya nirantar he
 If we move towards the rate of return of -100% net present value, the net present value moves towards infinity with the sign of the previous cash flow and the positive infinite of the rate of return, the net present value goes towards the first cash flow
 Therefore, if there are different signs of the first and last cash flows, then there is an internal rate of return
 bina IRR ke samay shrinkhalaa kaa udhaaharan : The total value of cash flows changes as the time between positive and negative cash flows after positive series, especially in the case of negative cash flows
 pratifal dar ke parinaam kaary, sakaaratmak evam nakaaratmak anant se nirantar or ek saamaan tareeke se kam hote rahete hai, isliye ek adwitiya pratifal dar he, jiske liye yah shunaya heisaliye IRR bhi adwitiya he
 However, it is not necessary in its entire field that NPV is also decreasing in a similar way on IRR
 isi prakaar, vishesh rup se sakaaratmak nakadi pravaah or vishesh rup se nakaaratmak nakadi pravaah ke maamle main IRR bhi adwitiya hota he Malwa is a region of western India formed by the origin of a volcano
 madhya pradesh ke pashchimi bhaag tathaa rajasthan ke dakshini-purvi bhaag se gathit yah kshetra pracheen kaal se hi ek swatantra raajnneetik ikai rahaa he

 Presently Madhya Pradesh is situated in the western part of the province

 These Malavs were initially residents of Punjab and Rajputana regions, but after defeating Alexander they settled in Avanti and its adjoining areas

 The capital of Dasharana was Vidisha and the capital of Avanti was Ujjayini

 Thus 'malwa' as a geographical component gets its name from about the first century CE
 bharat ke anya rajyon kii bhanti malwa kii bhi raajnneetik simaaen raajnneetik gatividhiyon va prashasnic kaarnon se parivartit hoti rahi he

 On the basis of natural texture, the entire Malwa region can be divided into four parts - is kshetra ke antargat vidisha tathaa uske aas- paas kaa kshetra aata he, jiskaa pracheen naam aakar va dasharn tha
 The narrow expanse of the central Malwa plateau is surrounded by mountain ranges of Vindhyachal from east, north and south

 The region is bounded by the Vindhya Range in the south, a branch of the Vindhya Range extending from Bhopal to Chanderi in the east, the branch of the same mountain extending from Amakshera to Chittor in the west, and the Mukundwara Range extending from Chittor to Chanderi in the north

 gandharv mahavidhyalay bharat kaa ek pramukh sangeet shikshan santhaan he
 It is located in Delhi
 gandharv sangeet mahavidhyalay kii sthapana 1901 main pan vishnu digambar paluskar dwaara lahore main kii gai thi
 It was the first music school in India to be run with the support and donations of the public, not as some kind of state shelter
 yahan par sabhi logon ko sangeet kii shiksha dene kii vyavastha kii gayi thi
 In those days it was very difficult to have such a music institute where traditionally disciples and gurus could stay in one place to perform music, that too without state help
 isiilie digambar ji dwaara bahut si sangeet prastutiyaan di jaati thim, taaki vidhyalay ke kaam kaaj main koi baadha na aae
 In the year 1931, Panditji along with all his disciples held a seminar in Ahmedabad and thus paved the way for the establishment of the Gandharva Sangeet Mahavidyalaya Mandal, whose executive council and other members were given positions through elections
 itnaa hi nahin, unke sabhi shishyon ne desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main apane sangeet vidhyalay sthapit kiye or unhen gandharv sangeet mandal se sambhddha kar liya
 It was only in 1931 that Panditji died, which made the Gandharva Sangeet Mandal the task of running all the schools
 bharat main sangeet kii shiksha ko samarupata dene or sangathit karne ke liye is mandal ne kaary karnaa prarambh kar diya
 Music related courses were produced by Mandal
 isamen sabhi centre ke vidhyaarthiyon ko ek hi tarah kii shiksha or pariksha se guzarana hota tha
 Thus by 1950 more than 50 schools associated with Gandharva Sangeet Mandal were opened in almost all the Presidencies of the time
 1946 main ise sarkaar dwaara socity ke rup main register kiya gaya, jisase isaki khyaati or bhi bad gai
 Gandharva Sangeet Mahavidyalaya, Delhi was founded in 1939 by Padmashri Vinay Chandra Mudgal, a musician from the Gwalior Gharana
 pehle yah conot place ke prem house main sanchalit hota tha
 As a branch of this, it also started to operate near Delhi University in Kamla Nagar
 1972 main ise iske vartmaan sthaan dilli ke itio ke paas dinadayal upaadhyaay maarg par sthanantarit kar diya gaya or kamala nagar vaala centre alag se chaturang sangeet santhaan ke rup main kaary karne laga
 Even today the Mudgals act as its chief under the Mudgal family
 dilli kaa gandharv mahavidhyalay sangeet ke kshetra main apana ek alag mukaam rakhata he
 It also organizes Vishnu Digambar festival every year
 gandharv sangeet mandal se jude sabhi vidyalayon main sangeet main shiksha hetu sangeet praveshika, sangeet vishaarad or sangeet alankaar jaise diploma or certificate paathyakram uplabdh hai
 Thus, through all these courses, you have to give 8 years to master music
 gandharv sangeet mandal ke sabhi paathyakramon ko vibhinn rajya sarkaron or shiksha bordo ne manyata pradaan kii hui he or is prakaar aaj bhi sangeet ke vidyalayon kaa yah sanghathan sampoorn desh main sangeet kii seva karte hue sangeet shiksha ko uplabdh kara rahaa he

 One of the single largest purposes for lubricants, such as motor oil, is the protection of internal combustion engines in motor vehicles and electrically operated devices
 aam taur par lubricant main 90% base oil or 10% se kam yojak hote hai
 Sometimes synthetic fluids like vegetable oil or hydrogen containing polyolefins, esters, silicones, fluorocarbons and many other synthetic liquids are used as base oils
 yojakon se kam gharshan or ghisaav, vardhit chipchipahat, unnat chipchipahat suchakank, zang or oxikaran ke prati pratirodh, kalprabhaavan yaa sandushan, aadi hota he
 Lubricants like 2-cycle oil are also added to some fuels

 Another approach to reduce friction and wear is the use of bearings such as ball bearings, roller bearings or air bearings, which in turn require internal lubrication, or in the case of acoustic lubrication, the use of sound
 audyogic anuprayogon ke alaava, lubricant kaa kai anya prayojanon ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Other uses include cooking, bio-medical purposes on humans, ultra-sound testing, internal testing for men and women, and the use of personal lubricants for sexual purposes
 lubricant nimnlikhit mahatvapurn kaary nishpadit karte hai
 Lubricants are typically used to separate the moving parts in a system

 Both gas and liquid lubricants can transfer heat
 tathaapi, taral lubricant apane ucch vishisht taap kshamta ke kaaran or adhik prabhavi hai
 Generally, the liquid lubricant operates in and out of the cooler part of the system, although lubricants may be used for heating and cooling when a controlled temperature is required
 This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that goes away in the unit at a given time
 ucch pravaah pranaliyaan bahut zyada garmi le ja sakati hai or lubricant par thermal tanaav ko kam karne kaa atirikt laabh bhi uthaa sakati he
 In this way low-cost liquid lubricants can be used
 praathmik dosha yah he ki ucch pravahon ke liye aam taur par vishaal haudi or bade shitalan ekakon kii aavashyaktaa he
 a minor drawback is that the high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure upon sudden system shutdown
 ek automotive oil-kuld terbo charger ek theth udhaaharan he
 Turbochargers become hot red during operation and the oil that cools them remains because their time in the system is very short ie high flow rate
 If the system is stopped abruptly, the oil in the turbo charger is immediately oxidized and will block the oil passages including deposits
 These deposits can completely block the oil passages, reducing cooling over time, resulting in a complete shutdown of the turbo charger, usually with jam bearings

 The level of living of the workers had improved, it was difficult not to believe this truth, but Plekhanov proved that the rate of capitalist exploitation is increasing due to the use of new machines and the expected increase in wages
 bukharin kaa tark tha ki samrajyavaadee desh upniveshon ke shoshan dwaara apane shramjivi varg ko santusht rakh pate hai
 Trotsky etc
 said that the crisis of the capitalist has become ubiquitous and in this situation it is possible that the revolution should not be in the leading countries of Western Europe but in the relatively backward countries, where the communist link is the weakest
 kuch vichaarkon ne sarvapratham samaajawaadee kranti kaa sthaan rus ko batalaaya
 Trotsky and Lenin opined that socialist revolution can succeed at the same time that it is difficult to establish socialism in only one country without a permanent revolution spread across several countries

 Nikolai Lenin coordinated the above ideas and led the organization of the Bolshevik Party and the October Revolution

 In this conference, the nationalization of the means of production, the abolition of zamindari, the right to self-build the colonies, the revolutionary path to attain the goal and the dictatorship of the proletariat after the revolution - this policy was accepted, but there were differences in the leaders regarding the organization of the party Gone
 prashn tha ki dal kii sadsyta keval kaaryakartaaon tak simit ho athwa aadarshon ko sweekaar karanevaala prayek vyakti uskaa adhikari ho or kya kendriya samiti ko dal kii shakhaon ke bhang karne or unke sthaan main nai shakhaon kii niyukti karne kaa adhikaar ho? lenin ek faujee anushaasanwale suvyavasthit dal ke paksh main tha or conference main uskaa bahumat tha, at: is dhara kaa naam bolshevik padaa or duusari dhara menshevik kahalaai
 Later on, more differences emerged between these parties
 menshavik dal pehle jaarshahi kaa ant kaa poonjeewaadi loktantratmak kranti karnaa chahta tha or is kranti main vah poonjeewaadi dalon ke vam paksh se sahyog karnaa chahta tha, parantu 1905 kii kranti ke baad lenin uske saathi is nishkarsh par pahunche ki samaajawaadee kranti ke bhay ke kaaran poonjeevaad pratikriyaavaadi ho gaya he, at: vah poonjeewaadi loktantratmak kranti kaa netritv karne main bhi asamarth he
 Therefore, only the proletariat can lead this revolution and it is possible to combine this revolution with the proletarian revolution and establish socialism immediately after the monarchy
 kranti main kisaanon kaa sahyog praapt karne ke liye lenin samantvaadi jameen ko kisaanon main baantne ke paksh main tha, menshavik uskaa turant samajikaran karnaa chaahate the
 The Bolshevik Party opposed the First World War and gave the slogan of civil war to establish socialism

 Yugoslavia was very independent of its efforts, so it had a sense of self-respect

 At the level of doctrine, Tietism emphasized national communism, decentralization of power, private ownership of land by peasants, workers' control over industries in place of state and bureaucracy, and the communist party and greater independence within the country

 By accepting the demand for equality between communist countries, Khrushkov accepted Titoism in part, but at the same time he also made several important amendments to Lenin Stalinism

 ibrahim Ortelius ek flemish maanchitrkaar or bhugolic, paaramparik manyata ke nirmaataa ke rup main pehali aadhunik atlas, Theatrum Orbis Terrarum

 unhone yah bhi mana ja karne ke liye pehla vyakti he ki kalpana ke liye mahadwipon main ek saath jude hue the isse pehle ki bahati karne ke liye apane vartmaan sthiti he 
 Ortelius was born in the city of Antwerp, which was then in Habsburg Netherlands
 The Orthellius family were originally from the Holy Roman Empire of Augsburg, a free royal city
 In 1535, the family had fallen into Protestant under suspicion
 After the death of Ortelius' father, his uncle Jacobus van Meteren returned from religious exile in England to take care of Ortelius
 Abraham remained close to his cousin Emanuel van Meteren, who would later move to London
 In 1575 he was appointed geographer for the King of Spain, on the recommendation of Philip II, Arius Montanus, who certified for his fanatics

 Beginning as a map-engraver, in 1547 he entered the Antwerp Guild as a Saint Publisher's map
 He used his income to trade books, prints, and maps, and his travels included annual trips to the Frankfurt Book and Print Fair where he met Gerardus Mercator in 1554
 1560 main, haalanki, jab yatra ke saath mercator ke liye trir, loren, or potie, vah lagata he ke liye aakarshith kiya gaya he, kaaphi had tak ke dwaara Mercator ke prabhaav kii ore, karier kii ek vaigyanik bhugolvetta
 In 1564 he published his first map, Typus Orbis Terrarum, an eight-leaved wall map of the world, on which he identified Locio with Reggio Patalis as a far-reaching terra australis, reaching as far north as Locach
 As New Guinea
 Later on in this map appeared as Terrarum
 He also published a two-sheet map of Egypt in 1565, a plan on the coast of Brittenburg Castle in the Netherlands in 1568, an eight-sheet map of Asia in 1567, and a six-sheet map of Spain before the appearance of his atlas

 Errors are, of course, abundant, both in general assumptions and in detail; Thus, the outline is very defective in the beginning of South America, but in the 1587 French version of the right, and the Grampians of Scotland lie between Clyde and Clyde, but, as a whole, took this atlas with their text
 There was a memorial with rare erudition and industry
 Its immediate precursor and prototype was a collection of thirty-eight maps of European countries and Asia, Africa, Tartary and Egypt, gathered together by wealth and enterprise, and through agents of Ortelius' friend and mentor, Gillis Hooftman, Lord Of Cleydael and Aertselaer: Most of these were printed in Rome, eight or nine only in the southern Netherlands

 Theatrum of Orbis Terrarum inspired a six volume work entitled Civitates orbis terrarum edited by George Brown and illustrated by Frans Hogenberg with the assistance of Ortelius himself, who visited England to see his friend John D
 Mortlake in 1577 and Brown tells Ortelius put the pebbles in the cracks in the temple bells, being crushed by Bristol, on the back of the bell in the description of the 'brightovve' map 2, third edition 1581 1579 main ortalius ne apana namakaran tolmemicas laayaa or apane peregon shuru kii

 Among his last works was a version of Cesare, and Aurie Saculi Imago, German German Livestock Vita, Morus, Ritus et Dharmio
 
 He also assisted Welser in his version of the Peutinger Table in 1598

 This puzzle is done by Ravensburger, measures 6 feet × 9 feet, and has more than 18,000 pieces

 It was ruled in northern India by 187 BC
 From 75 BC i had lived for 112 years

 According to Malavikamitram, Pushyamitra was conquered in the Vidarbha war in about 184 BC during Pushyamitra's reign and the kingdom was divided into two parts

 The king of both parts considered Pushyamitra as their emperor and Madhavasen received a part of this kingdom

 Cotters should be applied only after applying any iron under the chest of the crank, otherwise the crank will hit the spindle or ball bearings
 kharabi ke kaaran yadi donon crank ek sidh main na hon, to cotter ke chapate bhaag ko retkar, yaa palatakar, samanjit kar dena chahie
 If the crank is loose on its axis, pushing the cotter to a greater depth is also useful
