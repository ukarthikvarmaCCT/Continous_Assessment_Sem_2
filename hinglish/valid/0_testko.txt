 In this way, even though the language is full of attitude, ritual and rudiments, systematic description of the figures and their review seems to be the main objective of the book
 alankaarawaadi hote hue bhi acharya rudrat rasauchity ke siddhant ke sameekshak rup main saamne aate hai
 He has considered the power of ornaments only for the fulfillment of rasa

 He was honored with the 2010 Nivano Shanti Award on 13 May 2010
 vartmaan main ve bhartiya reserve bank ke kendriya board kii ek nideshak bhi hai
 Ila Bhatt, who started her public life in 1968 under the leadership of the Women's Cell of India's first labor organization, the textile workers' union, has a unique place in the efforts to institutionalize volunteering to provide full employment to the poor women working in the informal sector

 Today more than thirteen lakh women are associated with it

 In 1951, during the first census of India, Ramesh Bhatt invited Ila to work with him to record the details of the families living in the slums, Ila very hesitantly agreed to it
 unhen pataa tha ki unke mata-pita apni beti ko ek anjaan yuvak ke saath gandi bastiyon main bhatakate dekhnaa haragiz pasand nahin karenge
 Later, when Ila decided to marry Ramesh Bhatt, the parents protested
 unhen dar tha ki unki beti aaajeevan garibi main hi rahegi
 Despite so much opposition, Ila married Ramesh Bhatt in 1955

 Today, the labor monopoly and labor unions of India remain a monopoly of men
 lekin bharat main pehla mazdoor sangh sthapit karne vaali bhi ek mahila ansuia sarabhai thim
 In 1968, Ila Bhatt headed the women's cell established in 1954 by the same textile workers union
 1971 main ahmedabad kii bazaar haathgadi khinchne vaali or sar par bojha dhone vaali pravasi mahila kuliyon ne apane sir par chat kii talash main ila bhatta se madad maangi
 Ila Bhatt saw that all these women are forced to live on the open road and their wages are extremely low
 unhone is vishay par sthaneey akhbaaron main likhaa
 The cloth merchants dismissed all the allegations of Ila Bhatt by publishing a counter-article and claimed to give fair wages to women porters
 ila bhatta ne vyapaariyon vaale lekh kii anek pratiyaan banavaayin or mahila kuliyon main baant deen taaki ve vyapaariyon se akhbaar main chhapi mazaduri kii hi maang karen
 This tactic of Ila Bhatt left the arrogance of the textile traders

 In December 1971, a hundred women workers and Seva Sangathan were born for this meeting
 jab seva ko ek mazdoor sanghathan ke rup main panjikrut karne kaa vichaar hua to shram vibhaag ne saafe inkaar kar diya
 The reasoning was that if a labor organization is to be formed, first the name of the owner should be mentioned where these people are on the job
 seva ke sari sadsyaayein asangathit mahila mazdoor thim
 They did not have a regular job
 lambi bahes ke baad hi seva ek panjikrut mazdoor sanghathan ban paaya
 In 1981, the upper castes attacked backward castes in protest against reservation
 seva ne pichhadi va anusuchit jatiyon par ho rahi hinsa kaa purazor virodh kiya jabaki kapadaa kaamgaar sangh maun rahaa
 The menial, racist leadership of the textile workers union became so enraged by the actions of Ila Bhatt fighting for the unorganized women workers, supporting the backward castes that they expelled the service from their organization itself
 ila bhatta ke anusaar yah nishkasana ek vardaan siddh hua
 After this service became the confluence of the women's movement, the workers' movement and the cooperative movement
 ila bhatta ke sanghathan seva kaa mukhya lakshya mahilaon ko sampoorn rojgaar se jodna he
 Total employment does not mean just a job; Rather, there is food security and social security along with the job
 iskaa matlab he kamgaaron ko is tarah kii gatividhiyon main lagaana jo unhen aatm-nirbhar banaati hon
 It focuses on three things: building livelihoods, protection of existing livelihoods and increasing efficiency for progress
 seva apane sadasyon ko awaas, bachat or rin, pension tathaa beemaa jaisi sahaayak seva bhi pradaan karti he
 Apart from this, child care and legal assistance are also provided
 seva ne vyavastha parivartan ke kai udhaaharan pesh kiye hai
 For example, Vanlakshmi, the agricultural committee of landless Dalit women in Mehsana district of Gujarat
 is samiti kii striyaan plastic kii chadar se dhanke talab main barsaati pani kaa sangrahan karti hai taaki garmi ke dinon main bhi sinchai kii ja sake
 These women also run power tillers
 aas-paas ke gaanvon se kisaan vanalakshmi main dekhne-seekhney aate hai
 Likewise, in the dry desert region of Banaskantha, women did not have land rights
 iske liye unhen kai dashakon tak sangharsh karnaa pad saktaa tha
 But the Mahila Pani Panchayat formed by the organization of working women made women the owners of water
 isi pani kii milkiyat ke chalate ve zamin kii maalik bhi banati chali gayin
 The village-dominated power relations also changed due to the control gained through water

 bird flu yaa pakshi influenza yaa pakshi flu ek vishaanu janit rog he
 This virus, called influenza a or type a virus, is commonly found in birds, but sometimes it can infect many mammals, including humans, when it infects humans it is called influenza
 
 influenza e ke kai prakaar hote hai jinhe sabase pehle 1878 me italy main ek pakshi main paaya gaya tha
 There are no specific symptoms to identify the disease separately and in most of its forms many weak symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, which is also a symptom of common cold
 kuch prakaar ke influenza e kaa sankraman pakshiyon ko or kuch kaa manushya or anya stanadhariyon ko maarane me sakasham hota he
 In 1918 / 1919, the influenza, known as Spanish flu, was responsible for the deaths of about 5 to 100 million people
 ek or prakaar, jo asian flu ke naam se janaa jaataa he, 1957 main lagbhag 10 lakh logon kii maut kaa jimmedaar bana or duusare ek honkong flu ne bhi 1968 main das lakh logon ko maar kii neend sula diya
 H5N1, a subtype of influenza A, killed six people in Hong Kong in 1997, but has not seen an outbreak in China since 2003
 2005 ke madhya tak, yah mukhya rup se dakshin purvi asia main vyaapt tha, lekin tab se yah africa or europe ke kuch hisson main fail gaya he
 It has killed millions of birds so far and millions of other birds have also been killed to limit its spread
 ab tak yah mukhyat: ek pakshi rog he or bahut kam insaan hi isse sankramit huye hai
 The concern about H5N1 is that it is continuously spreading at a very fast pace and it can take the form of an epidemic and kill millions of people at any time
 duniya bhar kii sarkarein is samasya se nipatane ke liye arabon dollar kharch kar rahi hai
 This expenditure mainly includes studies of H5N1, discovery of vaccines, production and storage of flu-resistant drugs, conducting of pandemic measures and also many other important activities
 bharat me yah vishaanu mukhyat: bangladesh se sate assam or pashchim bengal me paaya jaataa he or har 6 maheene ke antaraal par iske pun: paye jane kii khabar aati rahati he
 State governments are unable to overcome this even after their lakhs of efforts

 As a result, there is a huge loss in revenue of the country
 varsh 1998 se yah samasya ek pahli bani rahi hai
 So that the spongy tissue is not due to external factors, such as temperature, vascular temperature, etc
, because they are indistinguishable from healthy fruits and spongy tissues for outbreaks, which have been continuously monitored on the same inflorescence
 spji tissue kii tivrata fal kii paripakvata se sambdhit he or yah poshak tatwon,visheshkar calcium or boron kii kami ke kaaran hoti hatishu kii astavyastata,jo ki spji tissue ke samaan sthaneey rup se prakat hoti he,prarbh main us kshetra se poshak tatwon ko dubaar ikattha karne se hoti he na ki vikaas ke samay poshak tatwon ke pradaay ke abhaav main
 The spongy tissue is proportional to the number of fruits planted in the inflorescence, showing the potential for internal competition of the fruits during development
 anuvshik rup se ek kamjor beej pratispardhaa main tik nahin paaegaa or yadhypi fal bhautik rup se ped se sbadhd dikhataa hai,phir bhi mukhya ped se srachanaatmak rup se yaa kayirki rup se,sbhavat: ssadhano ke vipareet bahaav ko rokane ke liye,alag ho jaataa he
 The nutrient requirement of the seed is met through a gland on the nucleus by the donor tree
 jab iske vikaas ke dauraan ped se sidhe pradaay kathin hota he tab beej madhy-fal bhiththik par nirbhar hota hai or guthli ke paas sitht kisi bhi sthaan se ssaadhanon ko yadchhik rup se lete hai,jisase poshak tatwon kii kami hoti he or tissue suukh jaati he
 Adulterated seeds, like mangoes, pre-germinate even when they are grown on the female plant and require constant moisture to remain germinating for durability
 beej env iske daata ped ke beej sanvaahan kii kami vikasaatmak rup se baari skhya main mahattvpurn ghatnaon ko ghatne detii hen,jisse ankuran-reeti main bhrun kaa karyiki badlaav hota he;ankuran-kaary bhraniya vikaas ke kaary ko aswikrat kar detaa hen
 Therefore, a functionally active embryo, being of high priority merging and being able to remove the saplings from the pulp part of the fruit through the vascular, located on the nucleus, induces spongy tissue formation
 spji tissue zyaadaatar sthaneey vikaar he or nishchit rup se guthli ke sataha par lagati he
 In addition, it aggravates skepticism over the major role of seeds for spongy tissue, with the emergence of seedlings in some fruits infested with spongy tissue
 namoonay kii vistrut jaanch or vyvasathit nirikshan se pataa chalaa ki spji tissue env beej kii ankuran-reeti main badlaav kaa sidhaa sbadh hai
 Physiological and biochemical studies have validated this hypothesis and provide conclusive evidence of seed formation for spongy tissue
 radiotressor titium adhyayan ne spji tissue se prakopit fal ke goode se beej main honevaale adhikadhik pani ke sgrahan ko spasht rup se dikhaaya gaya hai
 The absence of spongy tissue in fruits infested with mango seedling mites gave a strong natural proof of the direct role of the seed that the mite eats only the seeds
 alphonso or totapuri aam par kiye gaye tulanaatmak adhyyan ne alphonso main spji tissue ke prakope main nabhik par vrintika ke sbdh ke mahatva ko samajhane main madad kii
 Regulation of spongy tissue by altering the metabolic function of the seed using plant genetic resources not only proved the role of the seed but also provided new hopes for the control of this disorder in 'alphonso' / Low of the seed's metabolism
 Regulation seems to be a viable policy to prevent spongy tissue in this variety / The use of paclobutrazole to prevent spongy tissue has been an invaluable The academy provided insight, but there are limitations in its practical use due to export-restrictions and harmful to health
 is liye kuch paryaavaran -anukool mishranon kaa vikaas kiya gaya or spji tissue ko rokane main unki prabhavkarita k bhartiv bagwani anusdhaan ssthaan ke bagan or maharashtra ke konkan kshetra kr kisaanon ke baganon main moolyankan kiya gaya,jisak parinaam acha tha

 The farmers complained that the growth and development of most of the fruits was affected by the mixing of the mixture before the scheduled functional stage

 'dhaatu' ke anya arthon ke liye dekhen - dhaatu According to chemistry, metals are those elements that readily give up electrons and form cations and form metallic bonds with atoms of metals
 electranik model ke aadhaar par, dhaatu electranon dwaara aachhadit dhanayanon kaa ek latis hai
 Traditional definitions of metals are given based on their external properties
 saamanytah dhaatu chamkile, pratyasth, aghatvardhaneey or sugarh hote hai
 Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity, while non-metals are generally brittle, shiny, and are conductors of electricity and heat
 rasinic tatwon ko sarvapratham dhaatuon or adhaatuon main vibhajit kiya gaya, yadhyapi donon samoohon ko bilkul pruthak nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Defining metal is a difficult task
 mote rup se ham kah sakate hai ki yadi kisi tatv main nimnlikhit sampurna yaa kuch gun hon to use dhaatu kahenge : We can say that if an element is not luminous and conducts electricity in a pure state, it is non-metal
 prakruti main asamyukt avasthaa main birli dhaatu hi milti he
 Gold, silver, platinum and sometimes copper metals are occasionally found
 adhikansh dhaatuon ke ayask milte hai jo adhaatuon ke saath dhaatuon ke yogic hote hai
 These compounds are also mixed in other minerals rather than in pure state
 in ayskon se vividh ritiyon dwaara dhaatuen nikaali jaati hai
 Metals are often chemically reactive
 hawa main oxygen se sanyog kar dhatvik aksaid banaate hai
 Alkali metals are the most functional, while alkali soil metals are followed by them
 udaahranarth - Oxidation of transition metals occurs relatively slowly
 dhatvik aksaid dhaatu ke upar ek parat bana lete hai, jaise - lohe main jang laganaa
 Metallic oxides are alkaline while non-metallic oxides are predominantly acidic
 hellojanon se abhikriya karte dhaatu dhatvik heloid lavan banaate hai
 For example - adhik kriyasheel dhaatu jal ke saath abhikriya karke kshar banaate hai or hydrogen gas mukt karte hai
 Less reactive metals do not react with water at ordinary temperatures, but they react with steam in hot state to form metallic oxides
 amlon se abhikriya karke dhaatu lavan banaate hai or hidrogen gas mukt karte hai - Metals are malleable - they can be beaten with a hammer and lengthened
 jaise kisi aluminium yaa tambe ke taar ko par prahaar karan se uskaa prasar hota he
 Metals are also ductile, that is, they can be pulled to form a long wire
 adhaatuon main yah gun nahin paaya jaataa he
 For example, no matter how much phosphorus is drawn, it cannot be made as a long wire
 dhaatuon kaa ghanatv bhi ucch hota he tathaa inamen ek vishesh prakaar kii chamak hoti he jise 'dhatvik chamak' kehete hai
 Most metals range from brownish white to shiny white
 swarna or tamra iske apwaad hai
 All metals are solid except ordinary mercury

 But there is no similarity between them

 It is estimated that the tantalum is 6,100 ° C
 Will evaporate yadi ham vidyut-chaalakata par dhyaan den, to gyaat hoga ki adhaatuon ke vipareet dhaatuen uttam chaalak hai
 Silver is the best electrolytic among metals
 yadi tulana ke liye uski chaalakata 100 maan lee jaae to kuch anya saadhaaran dhaatuon kii chaalakata nimnlikhit sarini ke anusaar hogi- The conductivity of the boron would be 10–10 on this measurement
 isi prakaar dhaatuen uttam ooshmaa chaalak bhi hoti hai
 In particular, both conductivities of pure metals remain approximately in the same order
 taap ghataane par dhaatuon kaa vidyutpratirodh ghatata he, athwa ham yah bhi kah sakate hai ki chaalakata badhati he
 Metals increase in size as their temperature increases
 is gun ko tapiya prasar kehete hai
 The same properties of mercury are taken advantage of in thermometers
 kuch aisi mishradhatuen bhi bani hai jinka taap ke saath tapiya prasar ati sookshm he
 Magnetic properties are absent in other metals except iron, nickel, and cobalt
 dhaatu main apana aakaar rakhane kii badi kshamta hoti he
 On this side it is very resistant to external pressure
 mangneej sabase kathor dhaatu he or lithium sabase komal
 Tungsten is the best and very low lead in stress
 anek dhaatuon main ghatuvardhyataa or tanyata ke gun hote hai
 They can be beaten and made into thin layers
 tanyata ke falswaroop yadi kisi patale chhidr ke madhya se unhen khinchaa jaae to unke patale taar khinch aayenge
 Metals are crystalline which is mostly of the money system
 dhaatu ke parmaanu dhan ke aakaar main susajjit hone ke kaaran isi shrenee ke crystal banaate hai
 Some metals form the crystalline system
 kabhi kabhi ek hi dhaatu ke parmaanu ek se adhik pranali main vyavasthit hokar vibhinn rup main crystal banaate hai
 These will be called imperfection
 dhaatu ke parmaanu electrondaata hote hai
 Their cations in the crystal will remain in the fixed space and free electrons in their spaces
 is prakaar yah electron swatantra or sachal rahenge, jiske kaaran dhaatu main ucch chaalakata, paravartakata aadi gun aa jate hai
 Almost all properties of metals are the function of their atomic number
 yah aavartita parmaanu aaytan vidyut or ooshmaa chaalakata, ghatvardhyataa, tanyata, sangalan kii gupt ooshmaa aadi main ullekhneey hai
 Ladder Maier first attracted the attention of scientists towards this periodicity by the periodic table of elements
 ayskon se dhaatu ke nishkarshan or upyog main laane ke purv unke shuddhikaran kii prakriya ko dhaatukarm kehete hai
 The heaviest metals are osmium oselot , jise bouna tendua bhi kaha jaataa he ek prakaar kii junglee billi he jo dakshin america, madhya america or mexico main pai jaati he

 The spots formed on it converge and make designs like stripes on it
 har kaan ke peeche ek safed dhabba hota he jise jeevvaigyanik 'oseli' yaa 'nakli aankh' kehete hai
 It has a black stripe on its long tail
 oselot nishacharata dikhataa he or apana nijee kshetra chunakar uski ji-jaan se raksha karata he
 Ocelots have intense battles for territorial control and are willing to fight until they die

 hindi aandolan bharat main hindi evam devanagari ko vividh saamaajik kshetron main aage laane ke liye vishesh praytn hai
 It started at the time of Bharatendu Harishchandra
 is aandolan main sahityakaron, samajaseviyon kaa vishesh yogadan tha
 During the time of Bharatendu, the situation of Hindi had become very critical
 angrej apane 'foot daalo or raaj karo' kii niti ke anusaar alpsankhyakon ko badhaava dete the
 He used to hang various obstacles in the path of Hindi
 urdu-premi sahityakar nayi hindi ko apane liye bahut bada khatra maanate the
 Apart from this, orthodox writers of Hindi were clinging to the old poetic traditions
 ve aadhunik hindi main gadhy ke vikaas ke prati udasin the
 Many people think that the new language 'urdu' was born after the Muslims came to India
 aisa nahin he
 No new language was born after the Muslims came to India
 do dharmon ke paas aane se koi nayi bhashaa janm nahin leti
 Muslims had also invaded Europe and fought with them for hundreds of years, but no new language was born there
 musalamaanon kaa bharat main pravesh aathvin shatabdi se hi armbh ho gaya tha kintu 'urdu' ne atharahavin shatabdi ke ant main hi saamne aayaa or janapadiya boliyon ke shabdon ke vyavhaar kaa bahishkaar isi samay hua jab bharat par angrejon kii pakad majboot ho rahi thi
 It is also not necessary that those of the same religion speak the same language
 arab, iran, turki teenon musalmaan desh hai kintu teenon kii bhashaayen alag-alag hi nahin, teen bhinn pariwaron kii hai
 When we consider what changes occurred in the languages and culture of Muslims in India, then these questions must be asked - Where did these Muslims live? What was his mother tongue? The Muslims who ruled in Delhi were neither Iranians nor Arabs
 hindi kaa urdu se vilgau isaliye aavashyak tha ki urdu kabir, tulsi, sur, mira, raskhaan aadi dwaara prayukt deshi shabdon kii parampara se apane ko jaanboojhkar alag kar liya tha
 
 matarukat ke do pahalu hai - ek to bahut se prachlit shabd 'ganvaaru' kahkar chhod diye gayi, duusare ucch samskruthik shabdaawalee ke liye keval arabi-farsi se shabd udhaar liye gayi
 Unlike Bangla, Marathi, Telugu, Sanskrit was despised in Urdu
 urdu main jitne arabi shabd angrejon ke raaj main aaye utane musalamaanon ke raaj main bhi nahin aaye the
 'urdu is a different language', 'even on the basis of religion, they are formed' - these ideas were propagated only in the British Raj, not during the rule of Muslims
 uttar-pradesh, madhyapradesh or bihar kii janata apni saanskrithik aavashyaktaaen kis prakaar puri karti? samast bhartiya bhashaaon kii li par chalakar yaa use chhodkar? farsi lipi apanaakar, matarukat kaa silsilaa maanakar or sanskrit shabdaawalee kaa bahishkaar karke? If the Hindi movement was not run in the huge triangle of Patna, Delhi, Ujjain; If the policy of taking the persian-persian and persian-arabic words were accepted, then this policy would have been fatal not only to the people here, but to the people of the whole country
 bangala, marathi, telugu ke saath kadam milakar aage badhane ke badale vishaal hindi-bhashi kshetra unhen peeche thelta, unki pragati main baadhak banataa, unke vikaas ko roktaa
 Bharatendu has such an epoch-making significance that he recognized the cultural needs of his region; He struggled for Hindi; Strengthened his behavior in socio-cultural life; By ending the process of matrukat, he inspired Hindi to follow the same path on which Bangla, Marathi, Telugu etc
 were already growing
 hindi kaa vikaas hamaare rashtriya jivan ke liye aavashyak or aprihaary tha
 Cultural development of the vast Hindi region was not possible through Urdu
 san 1928 main khwaja hasan nijaami ne quran kaa hindi anuwaad karaayaa to unhone bhoomika main bataaya ki uttar bharat ke adhikansh musalmaan hindi jaanate hai, urdu nahin
 The Hindi movement that Bhartendu started was also useful for Muslims and not only for Hindus; Just like Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Rabindranath Thakur's bungalow service was for all Hindus and Muslims
