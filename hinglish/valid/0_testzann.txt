 Being childless, the king and his queens lived unhappily despite all the comforts

 While doing austerities for thousands of years, only the bones of the king remained, but his penance was not successful
 rani ne tab devi anusuya se upaay poocha
 Devi asked him to observe the Ekadashi of Shukla Paksha in Mal Maas
 anusuya ne rani ko vrath kaa vidhaan bhi bataaya
 The queen then observed Padmini Ekadashi fast as per the law of Goddess Anusuya

 An alpha channel may be stored in a separate bitmap, where it is similar to a grayscale bitmap, or in a fourth channel that, for example, converts 24-bit images to 32 bits per pixel
 The bits representing the bitmap pixels may be packed or unpacked, depending on the format or device requirements
 Depending on the color depth, a pixel in the picture will occupy at least n / 8 bytes, where n is the bit depth
 For an uncompressed, packed within rows, bitmap, such as is stored in Microsoft DIB or BMP file format, or in uncompressed TIFF format, a lower bound on storage size for a n-bit-per-pixel bitmap, in bytes, can be calculated as: In the formula above, header size and color palette size, if any, are not included
 Due to effects of row padding to align each row start to a storage unit boundary such as a word, additional bytes may be needed
 rangeen bit maanchitron ko vibhinn upkarnon va softwaron ke bich baantne va upyog karne ke liye microsoft ne vibhinn rango va unki gahraiyon ko pradarshit karne ke liye ek vishesh pradarshan paddati paribhaashit kii he
 They named it the device-free bitmap and the format of these files is named DIB or BMP
 microsoft sahyog website ke anusaar a tool-free bitmap is a file format for saving images that is used to define device-free images in different colors
 DIB kaa pramukh kaary kisi bitmap ko ek se duusare upkaran main sthantaran ke laayak bananaa hota he
 That is why it is called device free or device independent
 DIB ek bahari formet he jabaki upkaran par nirbhar bitmap computer main software dwaara banaae hue ek bit maanchitr vastu kii tarah rahata he
 It can only be used on that computer and software
 DIB ko mukhyat: biempi sanchikaon ke rup main sthanantarit kiya jaataa he
 Here, device-free "device independent" refers to the file format or file storage process
 The x Window System uses a similar XBM format for black-and-white images, and XPM for color images
 Numerous other uncompressed bitmap file formats are in use, though most not widely
 For most purposes standardized compressed bitmap files such as GIF, PNG, TIFF, and JPEG are used; lossless compression in particular provides the same information as a bitmap in a smaller file size
 TIFF and JPEG have various options
 JPEG is usually lossy compression
 TIFF is usually either uncompressed, or lossless lempel-ziv-welch compressed like GIF
 PNG uses deflate lossless compression, another lempel-ziv variant
 There are also a variety of "raw" image files, which store raw bitmaps with no other information; such raw files are just bitmaps in files, often with no header or size information

 In Sanskrit, Hindi and other Indian languages, the punctuation used at the end of a sentence is called full stop
 hindi main ise 'khadi pai' bhi kehete hai
 In Devanagari script, the symbol is used for this
 kuch log evam prakaashan iske sthaan par roman 'phul stop' kaa bhi prayog karte hai
 But this is not logical
 kuch log ise devanagari lipi kii parampara or vaigyaniktaa se ched-chhaad karne ke baraabar maanate he
 It is clear from looking at the alphabet of Devanagari script that it is dominated by pie everywhere
 lagbhag har varna main khadi pai yaa to purna rup se vidyaman he athwa aanshik rup se
 Scholars even believe that one name of Hindi is Khadi Boli because Khadi Pai is found everywhere in it
 isliye khadi pai devanagari lipi kii prakruti ke anukool he
 This should only be used for punctuation
 khadi pai ke paksh main ek anya baat bhi he
 This is the only punctuation mark in Hindi, the rest are English
 tab phir use kyon choda jaae
 a convincing argument in favor of not using a full stop is also that there is a lot of use of 'bindi' in Hindi - as nukta, to denote plurals, as decimal marks, and some letters like ङ
 i already exist in it
 is tarah hindi main bindi shabd ke aage, peeche, upar, neeche, sabhi jagah lagaai jaati he
 Now using it for punctuation too will spread heavy disturbances

 At very small pixel size, the dot does not appear properly or merges into the pixels around it
 isliye bahut chote tip sison main 'hindi', 'pard', aadi kii bindi dikhaai hi nahin detii
 If we start using the dot for punctuation too, then in very short typescares we will not know where the sentence is ending

 These special molecules are called neurochemicals
 mastishk ek vishesh prakaar kii koshikaon se mil kar bana hota he jinhen tantrika kosha kehete hai
 They are structural and functional units of the brain
 inaki kul sankhya 1 kharab se bhi adhik hoti he
 There are structurally three main parts of the brain
 agr mastishk, madhya mastishk evam pasch mastishk 
 The cerebrum and the dyncyphalon are the parts of the anterior brain
 medula, pons evam anumastishk pasch mastishk ke bhaag hote hai
 The middle brain and the posterior brain together form the brain column
 mastishk stambh mukhyatah sharir kii jaivik kriyaaon evam chaitanyata kaa niyantran karata he
 The cerebral hemispheres are the two isometric parts of the cerebral and are interconnected by the corpus callosum in the middle
 inaki sataha kaa bhaag pramastishk valkut kehalaata he
 The cells with functional symmetry of these different parts of the brain form the neural network
 vibhinn sanjaal mil kar pratichitra kaa nirmaan karte hai
 At the level of the image in the brain, all body parts have a structural representation
 pramastishk valkut kaa bhaag samast sanrachanaatmak nirupan ke liye uttardaai hota he
 This representation is perpendicular to the right axis of the body symmetry, the left cerebral hemisphere and the left axis represent the right
 chitra main sharir kii virupata iske vibhinn bhaagon evam ango ke mastishk main nirupit bhaag ko pradarshit karti he
 Medical evidence of this representation is also found in the brain
 jab mastishk kaa koi bhaag chot yaa kisi anya kaaran se prabhavit ho jaataa he to usase sambandhit ang yaa ang tantra bhi spashtatah prabhavit hota he
 This phenomenon is often seen as paralysis
 tantrika kosha hi soochna sanvahan kii ikai hoti he
 Mainly events outside and inside the nerve cell are responsible for this
 kosha kala ke andar or baahar sodium ins or ghulansheel avasthaa main vidyaman hote hai
 In case of stimulation, the convection of these ions deviates from normal and this continuous deviation converts to a momentum
 vibhinn uddipakon kii upasthiti main unka samakalan evam yoga bhi hota he or yah uddipan ko code karne kaa kaary karata he
 This momentum is carried from one end of the cell to the other

 The ends of the two cells form synapses
 ek vaahak koshika se sravit neurochemical duusari kosha ko ynic vichlan dwaara uttejit kar detaa he
 Thus the transmission of momentum is complete
 ab prashn uthta he ki mastishk main in sabhi sancharanon ke falswaroop kya hota he? mastishk main vibhinn staron par in soochnaaon kaa sankalan evam parimarjan kiya jaataa he
 For example, we can take the visual phenomenon
 kisi bhi drishy kaa dikhaai dena us par pad rahi prakaash kii kirnon ke prayaavartan ke kaaran hota he
 When the rays of this reversed light fall on our retina, an inverted and two dimensional reflection of that scene is caused

 Psychology studies mental operations and behavior
 man kaa adhyayan sadaiv ek abujh paheli rahaa he
 The most difficult is to define it
 saamanytah man ko mastishk kaa kriyaatmak nirupan maan lete hai
 There are three main activities of the mind, thinking, feeling and wanting
 sangyanatmak kriyaayein jaise ki smriti, adhigam, medha, dhyaan, drushti, shravan, swaad, gandh, sparsh ityadi man ke vibhinn prabhag hote hai
 The environment acts as a stimulant and we receive it through our senses
 gyanendriyaan jin soochnaaon ko mastishk tak pahunchaati he ve parivartan par aadhaarit hotin hai
 For example, some new phenomenon like sudden noise, change in temperature, sudden appearance of an object etc
 lekin iske bich kii ghatnaayen hamen prabhavit nahin karti
 For example when we turn on the radio in the room, we feel its sound
 phir ham isaki aawaaj se anukulit ho jate hai
 Again, our attention is diverted when the radio is turned off because there is a lack of sound
 is prakaar madhya main anukriya abhaav ko andrik anukulan kehete hai
 Our senses work to connect the external physical and internal psychological environment
 in antarsambadhon kaa adhyayan manobhautikee ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 Assuming the methodology and method of physics as its model, it was initially determined that at least how much amount of physical stimulation affects our senses
 or ise vibhinn gyanendriyon ke liye uddipan kii prabhavasimaa kaha gaya
 It has been observed that lower intensity stimulation than the effect limit does not affect the senses
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki gyanendriyon dwaara laai gai soochna or uske anuroop ek vyavhaar pradarshit karne main ek sundar layabaddhata dikhaai padati he
 Different parts of the brain are different and accountable for cognitive representation
 udhaaharan ke liye dekhne ke liye drishy kshetra, sunne ke liye shravy kshetra, gati ke liye anumastishk kaa kshetra uttardaai hota he
 Sometimes the concept of a scene with a particular sound is also encountered
 aisa mastishk ke vibhinn bhaagon ke aapasi sah sambadhon ke purna viksit kriyaatmak sanjaal ke kaaran hota he
 In brain research, particularly F

 The device is comparatively new and has proved very useful
 yah yantra mastishk ke kriyaatmak evam sanrachanaatmak dono tarah ke nirupan ke liye upyukt hota he
 The activity of a particular related part of the brain increases for a particular cognitive function and at the same time the consumption of glucose and oxygen in that part also increases
 iske falswaroop us bhaag main oxihemoglobin or carboxihemoglobin kaa santulan tulanaatmak rup se badal jaataa he
 The magnetic properties of these two molecules are different
 chumbakeey anunaad par aadhaarit yah yantra is parivartan ke aadhaar par mastishk kaa ek spasht evam trivimiya pratibimb nirupit karata he jisame mastishk ke kriyasheel bhaag spasht dikhaai padate hai
 There is an old saying that a healthy body inhabits a healthy mind
 vartmaan samay main yah kahawat bilkul sahi siddh hui he evam iskaa doosraa paksh bhi utana hi sahi he
 Our physical health depends to a great extent on our mental conditions
 tanaav, swasthy par vipareet prabhaav daalate hai or swasth maansik sthiti shaareerik swasthya ke anukool hoti he
 The holistic concept of psychiatric immunology is based on this
 iske anusaar hamaare swasthya ke liye hamaari maansik sthitiyaan, mastishk, antamasravi tantra evam pratiraksha tantra samuhik rup se kaary karte hai or ye sab aapas main pratyaksh evam paroksh rup se jud kar samasthaapan kaa kaary karte hai
 Their interaction is reflected in our health
 swasthya kii yah sankalpana koi bahut nai nahin he
 Our traditional medical science emphasizes mental purity for physical health
 yogavigyaan main bataae gaye pranayam tathaa asana, man evam sharir ko swasth rakhane ke saadhan kahe gaye hai
 Current research also indicates that if Yogic Asanas and Pranayama are done properly and regularly, then they can benefit a lot
 pichley ardhashatak main computer ke kshetra main hue vikaas ne ise shodhakarya kaa aavashyak ang bana diya he
 But its contribution to brain research is slightly different
 hamaare mastishk kii tulana computer se kii jaati he
 It is known that two parts of a computer are hardware and software
 hardware yantratmak evam drishy bhaag hota he evam software yantrettar bhaag he or isaki kriyavidhi kaa nirupan he
 Just as the brain is a biological structure and mind is its functional representation
 computer ko mukhyatah soochna sansaadhan kaa paryaay mana jaataa he
 It has been observed that the mechanism of our cognitive system is very mathematical
 purvavarnit uddipan-anukriya tantra kii kriyavidhi computer vigyaan se prarit he
 This new philosophy of the brain started in 1956 in MIT
 baad ke varshon main rumelheart evam meccleyland ne is vichaardhaara kaa poshan kiya or maanav sangyaan kii nai kritrim sanyoji network kii sankalpana prastut kii
 This concept was inspired by the subtle anatomy of the brain
 iske anusaar yah network kai choti ikaayiyon se mil kar bana hota he
 These units are connected to each other like biological neurons
 in ikaayiyon ke ek yaa adhik str ho sakate hai
 In the presence of various stimuli, they are also compiled and combined
 kriyasheeltaa kii sthiti main uddipan niveshi ikaayiyon dwaara grahan kiya jaataa he evam code kiya jaataa he
 From there, it is distributed evenly in units of levels inside the network as an activation model
 yah ikaiyaan swatantra rup main ek gananaa kaa kaary karti hai evam samuhik rup main soochna sansaadhan kaa kaary karti hai
 Finally, the output units represent behavior as the output model
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki rumelheart dwaara pradarshit sanyoji network, uddipan vyavhaar tantra kii uchit vyakhya prastut karata he
 There have been many applied research in this direction in the last decades
 sejanovsky evam rocenberg ne 1987 main nett naamak yantra banaaya tha joki sanyaaji network par aadhaarit tha
 It could represent the input words of English in speech
 vigyaan evam praudyogiki vishesh taur par tantrikavigyaan or computer vigyaan ke kshetra main ho rahe shodhon ne kritrim buddhi kii nai avadharana ko janm diya
 By artificial intelligence, we mean a creation developed by humans that can match humans in intelligence
 yah ek gahan chintan kaa vishay he ki kya computer maansik kshamtaaon main maanav kii barabari kar saktaa he
 It is true that computer is more advanced than human in some cases
 smriti bhandaaran kshamta, yatharthata evam pratikriya samay ke maamle main yah bahut aage hai
 Wisdom is defined by thinking, contemplation and creativity
 vartmaan main computer dwaara ek seemaa tak uparyukt kaary kiye gaye hai
 But it is not fair to say that artificial intelligence is developed to its limits
 robot vigyaan main kritrim buddhi kaa sabase adhik anuprayog hota he
 One such computer, deep-blue, defeated Gary Kasparov in chess
 kritrim buddhi ke anya anuprayog chikitsa vigyaan evam khagol shaastra main hai
 The study of the brain is also important because it is the only creation of nature that has the ability to influence nature
 vastav main prakruti ke saath iskaa sambandh dwidishaatmak hota he
 That is, this organ affects nature as well as affects nature

 The researcher of new religious movements, including the Radhaswami faith, Mark Jurgansmeyer interviewed the Fakir which revealed the Fakir's innermost
 yah saakshaatkaar fakir kii aatmakatha kaa ansh bana
 He was born on 18 November 1886 in village Panjhal, District Hoshiarpur, Punjab, India
 unki prishthbhumi main unka garib brahman parivaar or ek dabaa hua bachapan tha or ve ishwar bhakthi main raahat pate the
 After being a non-vegetarian for some time, his repentance and prayer led him through a divine scene through the donor Dayal Shiva Brat Lal to Radha Swami Mat
 unhone fakir ko radhaswami mat main dikshit kiya or 'saar-vachan' naamak pustak padhane ke liye di jo radhaswami mat ke sansthaapak shiv dayaal singh kii likhi hui thi
 Fakir found that the book was contrary to his Hindu beliefs and interest
 usamen kai dharmik andolanon ke bare kiye gaye ullekh fakir ke tatsambandhi vichaaron se mail nahin khate the
 However, due to his strong faith in Data Dayal Ji, he vowed that he would become truthful and follow the path shown by his Guru and tell his experience to the world
 He started the act of satsang to his followers after the demise of Data Dayal Ji and then told his felt truth to the people that the scenes, forms, colors and lines appearing in the believer seeker are actually Maya and not the truth
 The Fakir also stopped giving 'naam-daan' in the traditional way
 fakir kaa kahana tha ki satsang main aantarik anubhav gyaan kii ucchtar avasthaaon kaa unke dwaara kiya gaya varnan hi naam daan he
 He fulfilled all the duties of a Guru without becoming a Guru
 sankat or vipadaa kii sthiti main unke anuyaayiyon main fakir ke chamatkaari or divine rup kaa prakat hona sahitya main miltaa he
 But the fakir publicly separated all such miracles from himself, saying that what happened was due to the faith of the people and not because of the fakir
 He declared all such followers as his satguru, because the experience of those who considered him a guru forced the fakir to go beyond the experiences of mind, soul and word
 isise antat: unhone param shanti pai or unki satya kii khoj tathaa kured samaapt hui
 In view of the declining health of the Fakir, in 1980, at the request of Dr

 He also made it clear that his trust has nothing to do with the open humanity centers in his name in India and abroad and love for his masters

 He had also made it clear that there is no place of tomb, mausoleum, mausoleum or the worship of dead men in his purity
 at: unhone apane aap ko 'shiv samaadh' se asambaddha rakhaa
 Fakir had many sources of religious ideas such as his long association with Hinduism and Radhaswami faith and his experience in the word Surat
 The Fakir found much to agree with in his humanitarian view but disagreed with his traditional method of nomination and the prevailing Guruism in India
 aisi dharmik prathaon ke prati unki sahansheeltaa shunya thi jinase garib, vishwasi or bhole-bhaale logon kaa shoshan hota ho
 His literature testifies to the fact that he was a strong supporter of the basic principles of santmism practiced by Kabir but was disillusioned with the end result of the highest stages of the word surat yoga and mysticism nurtured by saints

fakir had faith in the idea that 'sex is only for the progeny origin'
 isse maanav jati ke ksht kam ho sakate hai
 According to his philosophy of life, wishing for others and his welfare is an important part of the optimistic view of life
 yuvaaon ko aantarik shanti ke liye unhone sadaa vyast rahane, apni aajeevika swayan kamaane, kisi sachche insaan ke maargdarshan main rahane or aatm-sanyamee banane kii salaah di
 As part of his social duty, he asked his followers not to cause trouble to others, to avoid talking unnecessarily, to be tolerant of bitter words and to serve fellow beings selflessly
 Stressed

 In many places he spoke of 'being true to oneself', surrendering to the will of God, meditating and thus attaining enlightenment in the end
 fakir ne anubhav kiya ki sabhi jeev param chetan tatva ke bulbule hai or maanav kaa antim lakshya shanti he
 In 1933, Daya Dayal ordered the fakir to change the teaching of saintly religion according to the future
 In order to follow the Guru's orders and carry forward the work of the donor Dayal in accordance with the changed times, the Fakir established the Manavata Mandir at Hoshiarpur in 1962
 ek masik patrika 'maanav mandir' kaa prakaashan shuru kiya gaya
 This temple is dedicated to humanity and human religion
 
 The Humanity Temple continued to be the center of his mission where he continued to tell people the truth of miracles and the truth ahead of the mind

 In December 2002, the European Union created an emissions trading system to meet these difficult targets
 Quota was introduced in six major industries: energy, steel, cement, glass, brick making and paper / cardboard
 It also stated that unsuccessful member nations not fulfilling their obligations would be fined, a carbon dioxide emission rising from € 40 / ton in 2005 to € 100 / ton in 2008

 parivahan CO 2 utsarjan 1990 main 21% thi, lekin 2004 tak isamen 28% kii vruddhi hui thi
 However, the status of the European Union is not undisputed under the Protocol
 ek aalochana yah he ki 8% katautee ke vajay sabhi EU sadsy desho ko 15% kii katautee kerani chahie, kyunki baatcheet ke dauraan EU ne jaha anya viksit desho ke kiye 15% kaa ek saamaan lakshya dhary kiya, vahin purv germany kii badi maatra main katautee sabhi main baant diya gaya, taaki samgr EU main 15% kaa lakshya behaal rahe

 As a result, it is unlikely that the government will be able to honor the declaration of 20% carbon dioxide emission reductions from 1990 levels until 2010], unless they take drastic action immediately after passing the Climate Change Bill
 2004 main, france uske antim koyala khadaan band kar di or ab parmaanu shakti se bijli kaa 80% utpaadan karata he
