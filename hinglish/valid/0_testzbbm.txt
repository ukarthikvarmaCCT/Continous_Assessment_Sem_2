 Open source software has a different relationship with intellectual property rights, so its importance cannot be denied
 ho saktaa he ki aane vaale kal main, soochna prodyogiki kii disha isi par nirbhar kare
 That is why it is absolutely necessary to know open source software, understand its importance, and assimilate the relationship with it and intellectual property rights

 It could have been fine a few years ago, but not today

 In today's open source software, doing all the work done at the office, writing, going to the internet, giving different types of powerpoint presentation, listening to songs, watching dvds, blogging, or anything else that we all want to do Is as simple as proprietary software
 The best thing is that there is no problem of intellectual property rights and there is no question of committing the common man from spending money and theft of software

 kuch lokapriy opensorce software nimna hai- 1
 Operating system is software which brings the hardware of a computer and runs a computer
 There are mainly three types of operating systems
 vindos kii tarah ke: yah duniya main sabase zyada lokapriy he Like Unix: There are many types of operating systems, the most popular of these is Linux

 We will discuss this in detail sometime, but only now that most of the forms of Unix are open source software

 yadi aap vindos main kaam karte hai tathaa linaks par jane kii baat sochate hai to aap open aphis daat aurg, firefox, thanderbard, sanbird or jimp par kaam karke dekhen| When we are talking about open source software, then let us talk about the three acronyms that are used in this regard
 FOSS / FLOSS: free software, open sorce software he par har open sorce software, free software nahin he
 GPL for free software Must be published under license, but open source software can also be published under many other types of licenses
 donon main antar to he par sambandh bhi gaharaa he
 All this has started with free software, so such software is called Free Open Source Software or FOSS for short
 yahaan free shabd kaa arth swatantraaa se he par free shabd kaa arth bina paise ke bhi hota he isaliye free shabd kaa prayog kuch chakkar main daal detaa he
 There are two different words in the French language Gratis which means Libre without money which means freedom, so people often use Free / Libre Open Source Software or FLOSS
 LAMP: open sorce software ke chaar mukhya stambh hai: linuxappachemysqlpython, Perl, PHP ityadi Linux and Apache have already been discussed
 mysql ek data-base prabandh karne kaa program he
 Python, Perl, PHP, etc
 are computer languages for scripting and writing programs
 aane vaala kal ho saktaa he ki isi LAMP se ujjwalit ho isaliye open sorce software ko kinare na kijiye, dhyaan main rakhiye| Linus Torvalds, who is the originator of Linux, has written his biography with David Diamond
 iskaa naam he 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary’| yah bahut acchhee pustak he tathaa ise padhne se jivan main aage badhane kii prerana milti he vah is pustak main open sorce software ke bare main kehete hai, 'the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest will not be excluded from its development
 


so open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It’s still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people's rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that does not mandate legal protection for such secrecy
 ' jab ham log baat open software main kuch phaayde ke bare main kar rahe he to bahut acha hoga ki kuch doosraa paksh bhi dekhen| bill gates, vindos ke janmdata hai
 He has written the book 'the Road Ahead'
 yah pustak bhi bahut acchhee he
 According to its name, it tells which side of information technology will go in future
 Many difficult questions are explained very easily in this
 isamen ve free software kii kamiyon ko is tarah se varnan karte hai, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab

 The name of Venus who composed it is found in the Mahabharata as 'shukracharya'
 shukraniti ke rachanaakaar or unke kaal ke bare main kuch bhi pataa nahin he
 Shukraniti has 2000 verses mentioned in its fourth chapter
 usamen yah bhi likhaa he ki is nitisar kaa raat-din chintan karne vaala raja apana rajya-bhaar uthaa sakane main sarvatha samarth hota he
 It says that there is no other policy like Shukraniti in all the three worlds and for business people, Venus has a policy, the rest is 'kuniti'
 shukraniti kii saamagree kaamandakeey nitisar se bhinn milti he
 Out of its four chapters, the first chapter deals with matters related to the king, his importance and duties, social system, minister and crown prince
 pracheen bhartiya ranithik chintan main shukraniti kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Shukracharya's creator Shukracharya holds a respected place in ancient Indian thought
 dandi ke ‘dashakumarcharitam‘ main raajnneeti shaastrakaron ke namollekh main sarvapratham sthaan shukracharya ko hi pradaan kiya he
 Despite being such an ancient text, it has details of many such topics which are relevant and useful even today
 shukraniti chintan kii gauravshaalee evam samrudh parampara kaa gyaan hota he
 Like Kautilya's 'arthashastra' and Machiavelli's 'the Prince', the king has also been taught to rule in Venus's Venus
 is prakaar isamen raajnneeti kaa saiddhanthik nahin varan vyaavhaarik paksh adhik mahatvapurn he
 According to Venus, "the king should abandon all apprehensions and follow a policy that kills the enemy, that is, victory"
 shukracharya ke anusaar, unhone apane shishyon ke saamne brahma ke nitishastra kaa saar prastut kiya he
 There are four basic chapters in the Shukra Policy
 iske vibhinn sanskarnon main pancham adhyay ’khil niti‘ ke rup main he jo mul granth kaa bhaag nahin he
 Determining the period of Shukracharya is a very difficult task
 apni vishaywastu va style ke aadhaar par yah kautilya ke arthshaastra ke baad kii rachana prathit hoti he
 It seems that the name Venus actually expresses a particular tradition of thinking, not a person
 bhartiya raajnneetik chintan ke strot ke rup main ise ek pramanik granth mana jaataa he
 Although there is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding the creation of Shukranitisar, almost all modern scholars agree that it is not a Vedic work but a post-christian work
 kashiprasad jaiswal ke anusaar, yah 8veen shatabdi kii rachana he
 Its author can be called the philosopher of this period
 shukraniti, kautilya ke arthshaastra ke samaan multah raajnneetik prakruti kaa granth he isamen shukr ne kautilya evam kaamandak ke samaan gyaan kii chaar shakhaayen - anvikshiki, trayee, vaarta evam dandniti ko sweekaar kiya he
 According to BK Sarkar, the commentator of Shukraniti, "penalty is a discipline related to governance and instruction
" ’’ yah kahana uchit he ki shukr ne vibhinn prasango main dand va niti kaa jo mahatv bataaya he vah dandniti arthath raajnneetishastra kaa hi mahatv hai
 Apart from the policy or ethics of punishments, all the scriptures are related to a limited part of the whole human behavior, but ethics is the scripture related to the whole human behavior
 is shaastra kii sahaayta se hi raja apane aadharbhoot dayitvon kii purti main safal hota he, kintu jo raja niti kaa tyaag karke achche vyavhaar karata he, vah dukh bhogata he or uske sevak bhi ksht pate he
 Shyamlal Pandey, stating the importance of Shukraniti essence, has said that it is the only available book based on the punishing ideology of ancient India
 shukracharya ke anusaar dharm, arth, kaam kaa pradhan kaaran evam moksh ko sunishchit karne vaala tatv nitishastra ko hi mana ja saktaa he
 Shukraniti portrays all the important aspects of political thought - philosophical, conceptual, structural, procedural, with substantial significance
 rajya ke prayojan, rajasatta par niyantran aadi saiddhanthik pakshon ke saath-saath dand va nyaayik prakriya, rajya kaa prashasan, rajya kii suraksha va yuddh, antararajya sambandh aadi aise vishyon kaa jo rajya ke vyaavhaarik pakshon se sambandhit hai, vishad vivechan kiya gaya he
 The theory of the origin of the state is not detailed in Shukraniti
 sampoorn granth main maatr ek shloke aisa he jise rajya kii utpatti se sambandhit mana ja saktaa he
 In the first chapter of Shukraniti, it is said, "by accepting his annual tax as a salary from the praja, the king situated as a lord has been appointed by Brahma as a servant for the praja"
 is prakaar jahaan rajya kii utpatti brahma dwaara bataakar, rajya kii utpatti ke daivi siddhanth kaa samarthan kiya he, raja ko praja-sevak bataakar uske praja-paalan ke daayitv par bal diya or uske kisi bhi prakaar ke daivi adhikaar ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 Venus has accepted the state as an indispensable and natural institution because it is the base state of the rise of this world
 jis prakaar chandramaa samudr kii vruddhi kaa kaaran he, usee prakaar rajya janata ke abhyuday kaa mul aadhaar he
 It is the state that provides justice, religion and work for justice
 jaise mallaah ke abhaav main nauka nasht ho jaati he, usee prakaar raja ke netritv ke abhaav main praja jan ke nasht hone kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Venus has held the state responsible not only for the physical safety of the subjects, but also for the moral uplift
 pracheen bhartiya chintan main rajya ko saptang rajya ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he, shukr bhi iskaa apwaad nahin hai
 The state is made up of seven limbs, it is made up of Swami, Amatya, Mitra, Kosh, Rashtra, Durg, Sena
 shukraniti main kaha gaya he, ‘‘rajya ke in saat nirmaanak tatwon main swami sir, amaatya netra, mitra karn, kosh mukh, sena man, durg bhujaaain evam raashtra pair hai
 "in another context, comparing the state to the tree, the root of this tree to the king, the wing to the ministers, the branch to the commander, the Pallavas to the army, the dust to the subjects, the fruits to the factors derived from the land and the seeds to the land of the state
" Has been said yah ullekhneey he ki jahaan aadhunik raajnneetik vichaarak rajya ke 4 nirmaanak tatv - jansankhya, bhu-bhaag, sarkaar evam samprabhutaa maanate he vahiin shukr 7 nirmaanak tatv maanate hai
 Explaining the difference between the state and the nation in Shukraniti, it has been said that sovereign control over a specific nation gives it the form of a state
 is prakaar shukraniti rajya va raashtra ke madhya antar ko aadhunik raajnneetik vichaarkon kii tarah spasht karti he
 In Shukraniti, the work area of the state is described as very broad
 shukr ne rajya ke karttavyon ke 8 pramukh kshetron kaa ullekh kiya he- It is clear from this list of state obligations that Venus has rendered a wide scope of the state
 saath hi yah bhi spasht kar diya he ki rajya ko apane dayitvon ko puraa karne ke liye aavashyak saadhan bhi arjeet karne chahie
 Venus has included the following major functions in the domain of the state: - shukr ke anusaar, sena evam raashtra kii raksha evam samruddhi ke liye kosh kaa aadharbhoot mahatv he
 But the king should not collect the funds unjustly
 yadi raja sankatkaal kaa muqabla karne ke liye praja se adhik dhan vasuul kare to sankatkaal kii samaapti par praja ko byaaj sahit dhan vaapis karnaa chahie
 Venus has given central importance to the Rajapada, the main duty of the king is praja-ranjan
 raja ke bina praja aise hi nasht ho jaati he, jaise mallaah rahit nauka nasht ho jaati he
 Venus, as mentioned, describes the king as composed of the portions of the eight deities
 shukr aise bhartiya vichaarak hai, jinhone raja ke pratyaksh dev hone kii dharna kaa virodh kiya he
 Venus has neither accepted the king as a 'dev' nor considered her divine authority, but must have explained the divinity of her obligations
 dayitvon kii divyata ke kaaran swayan shaasha bhi apni ichha se in dayitvon se mukt nahin ho saktaa
 Adhering to Rajdharma also makes the petty king superior, while behaving in contrast, the best king also becomes petty
 shukr ne naitik aadhaar ko bhi vargeekaran main pramukhataa dete huai kaha he ki raja kii aay praja ko pidaa die bina honi chahie tathaa yah keval rajtantr se sambandhit vargeekaran hi he
 Venus has propounded that the successor of the rule should be taken from the Rajkula itself, but the king's eldest son should not automatically be considered the successor of the rule
 raja ke jivit rahete hue hi uttaradhikaar ke prashn ko nishchit karnaa acha he
 Instead of many people, one person should decide the successor
 shukr ne uttaradhikaar ke prashn ko hal karne ke liai rajya kaa vibhaajan karne ke vichaar kaa dridhtaa se nishedh kiya he kyoki rajya vibhajit hone se shatru dwaara nasht karne kii ashanka rahati he
 There can also be such differences in the claimants of succession which can cause destruction for the state and the state
 atah in sabhi ke rajasi maan-sammaan ke jivan kaa prabandh kiya jaae, taaki ye santusht rah saken
 In Shukraniti, the ruler has been given wide powers, but the ruler is expected to use them according to law and religion
 shukr ne raajaaon ko nirankush evam swechhachari banane se rokane ke liai teen upaay sujhaaye he - Venus has expected the ruler to take control of traditions, prestigious social values, etc
 shukraniti saar dwaara sujhaaye gaye naitik upayon main raja kii shiksha, niti va darshan ke upadesh, raja ke sahaayakon evam paramarshdaataaon dwaara prastut drushtaant parloukik sukhon evam dukhon kii vyavastha, raja ke vibhinn karttavya, raja kii dincharya aadi ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Proper consultation of the nature of governance in the administrative area has been considered necessary to save the king from being misguided
 shukr ne rajya ke sucharu sanchaalan ke liye mantriyon aadi ke paraamarsh ke prati shaasha kii nishtha kii aavashyaktaa ko pratipaadit kiya he, saath hi paraamarsh dene ke liye niyukt padaadhikariyon se yah apeksha kii he ki ve raja ko sadaiv uchit paraamarsh den
 Even in an emergency, the king is not considered independent
 vah sambandhit pakshon kii sahmati se hi kathor nirnay lene main samarth hota he
 The behavior of apathy in the judicial field has been termed as a gross moral offense by the ruler, and has warned that if he does, he will go to hell
 nyaayik mukademon ke nirnyon ke liye ek nishchit evam nishpksh prakriya kaa ullekh kiya he, jiskaa raja dwaara paalan kiya janaa he
 Venus has given a detailed description of the qualifications and means of justice of the members of the Nyaya Sabha
 uparokt vivaran se yah spasht he ki shukr ne adharmsheel, swechhachari tathaa raashtra kaa vinaash karne vaale raja ke virodh ko uchit mana he or uske niyantran ke liye vibhinn naitik upayon va vaidhanik upayon ke saath hi vidhanetar upayon par bhi vichaar kiya he
 Even in the discipline festival of Mahabharata, considering the evil king as a true Kali Yuga, his slaughter is considered appropriate
 yah ullekhneey he ki shukr ne dusht va swechhachari raja ke niyantran athwa uski pad-mukti kii vyavastha sweekaari he or uske vadh kaa samarthan nahin kiya he
 According to Shukraniti essence, it is impossible for a highly skilled king in all disciplines to do even the most extreme work like Rajkarya alone
 atah raja ko apane sahaayakon se paraamarsh karnaa chahie
 According to Venus, the king who does not pay attention to what is said in the mouth of the minister, despite being a king, in reality, like a robber, is only robbing the wealth of the subjects
 shukr ne mantri parishad ke sadasyon ke liye ‘prakruti‘ shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 According to Altekar, "venus is of the opinion that caste should be questioned only on occasions of food and marriage, not at the time of appointment in the Council of Ministers
 shukr ko shudra ke adheen sainya vibhaag rakhane main koi aapatti nahin he, yadi vah yogya evam rajbhakt ho
 In fact, the Venusian vote is in keeping with the liberal tradition of ancient India
 shaantiparv ne mantriparishad main pratham teen varnon ke alaava teen yogya shudron kii niyukti kaa spasht ullekh kiya he
 The representative should be so qualified that he can identify the doable and unworkable tasks in terms of country, time and place
 mantriparishad kaa teesraa sadsy pradhan he, jo shashan ke sabhi kaaryon kaa saamaanya nirikshan karne kii yogyata rakhata he
 The fourth member is the secretary, who is a minister of war in terms of his actions
 vah sena evam iske kaaryon kaa samast gyaan rakhata he
 The fifth member belongs to a minister, who in modern terms can be called a foreign minister or a foreign minister
 chatha sadsy pradvivak he, jo pradhan nyaayadhish he evam nyaay vibhaag kaa pramukh raajnneetik adhikari bhi he
 He should know the scriptures and the prevailing ethics
 saatvaan sadsy pandit, dharm ke tatv kaa gyaata hona chahie
 The eighth member Sumantra can be called the Finance Minister or Treasurer of Venus, who should have complete knowledge of income and expenditure
 navaan sadsy amaatya desh tathaa aalekhon kaa gyaata hona chahie
 He keeps an account of the measurement of the land of the cities, villages, forests located in the state and also records the income from them
 variyata kram main antim sthaan doot kaa he
 He should be a master of education, good speaker, fearless, understanding of the state of the country and time
 ke
 pi
 jaiswal ke anusaar pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik granthon me keval shukranitisar main hi mantriparishad kii karypranali par vistrut prakaash daalaa gaya he
 B
 K
 According to the government, the following facts about the working of the Council of Ministers have been clarified in this book - mantriparishad kaa sadsy evam sahaayak milakar apane vibhaag se sambandhit kisi vishay par ek lekh taiyaar karte he
 The Raja's commentary on this article first ends its flaws
 iske baad sabhi mantriyon kii salaah lee jaati he, jisase sabhi vibhaagon main taal-mail evam sahyog bana rahata he
 This article is signed by all ministers with their own currency
 ant main punah raja avlokan karata he or apana antim nirnay detaa he
 Thus, this process is beneficial for the state because the king also knows the opinion of everyone in writing and reserves the right to final decision
 shukr ne do prakaar ke prashasan kaa ullekh kiya he- kendriya prashasan evam sthaneey prashasan
 Stating the importance of royalty in the central administration, Venus has advised the king to appoint many knowledgeable and virtuous assistants for the advancement of the kingdom
 shukr ne saat prakaar ke sevakon kaa ullekh kiya he or sabhi virgon ke adhikariyon, sahaayakon evam sevakon kii niyukti sambandhi yogyata par vistaar se prakaash daalaa he
 Venus has also mentioned the organization of local administration, which mentions the following 6 officers - kushal prashasan hetu anivaary he ki raja adhikariyon ke kaaryon par kadi najar rakhe
 It has been said in the Shukraniti that if a hundred people give an application against an officer, then that officer should be removed
 shukr ne paraamarsh diya he ki raja anyaay karne vaale adhikariyon se unki shaktiyaan chin le
 It is also necessary for control that one person should not stay in one post for long
 kisi vyakti kii pad par niyukti keval yogyata ke aadhaar par kerani chahie
 Shukraniti mentions 20 departments of administration - yards, horse, gold, silver departments etc
 in vibhaagon ke adhyaksh pad ko saamaanya rup se karm sachiv kaha he, kintu iske saath hi adhyaksh pad ke liai adhyaksh, pati yaa adhipati kii sangya kaa prayog kiya he
 The administrative organization propounded in Shukraniti is multi-layered
 prashasan ke kendriya str par sangathit vibhaagon ke atirikt, shukr ne sthaneey, gramin or nagareey prashasan kii sanghathanaatmak sanrachana par prakaash daalaa he
 Venus is of the opinion that in every village and every town, Bhaghar, the president of the village of Sahsadh, should be appointed
 prashasan ke samast staron par niyukt carmikon kii vyavsaayik va takneekee yogyataon kaa shukr niti main vistaar se ullekh kiya gaya he
 Venus has given utmost importance to the written order in the office system of administration
 unke anusaar, adhikari yaa sahaayakon ko bina likhit rajagna ke koi kaary nahin karnaa chahie, kyonki raja kii rajmudra va hastakshar yukt likhit aadesh hi vaastavik raja hota he, vyakti raja nahin hota he
 Venus has accepted the system of preserving the written order of the king as a memento
 iske saath hi unhone prashasan main dainik, masik, vaarshik tathaa bahuvarshiya report taiyaar karne par bhi bal diya gaya he
 Venus has emphasized on daily receipt of information for efficient administration of administration
 unka mat he ki raja ko pratidin 100 kos dur tak ke pradeshon kii suchnaaain praapt honi chahie
 Venus has accepted the system of guards and guards for the security of state offices
 carmik vyavastha ke vivechan kii drushti se shukraniti ko vilakshan granth mana ja saktaa he, kyoki carmik vyavastha ke vibhinn pakshon kaa jaisaa sateek, vyavasthit va purna chithran isamen uplabdh he, vah kahin nahin miltaa he
 Code of Conduct for State Employees: All employees are expected to follow the general rules of conduct
 in niyamon yaa aachaar samhita kaa paalan karne vaale karmchaariyon ko granth main shreshth carmik bataaya gaya he
 According to Venus, the devotee should work fully devoted to the master and to his service work
 use shishtaapurvak raja ko sadkaarya kii prerana deni chahie tathaa kabhi bhi maatr chatukaarita nahin kerani chahie
 Employees should never make false promises to the subjects
 anuchit kaaryon jaise- rishwat, jua, krodh, dushcharitrataa aadi ko tyaag dena chahie
 Venus is considered inferior to those who act contrary to the above qualities
 vetan, vetanman va vetanvruddhi : vetan bhugtan ke siddhanth main kaary va kaal donon ko hi aadhaar banaaya gaya he arthath ek nishchit kaal main kiye gayi kaary kii maatra dekhakar hi bhritti di jaati he
 Venus has advised the king not to cut salary and always pay at the appointed time
 shukraniti main spasht pratipaadit kiya gaya he ki carmik kaa nunatam vetan itnaa hona chahie ki us par ashrith vyaktiyon kaa saralata se bharan-poshan ho sak
 The pay scales are divided into superior, medium, even and inferior
 shukr ne raja ko chetavanee di he ki atyant kam vetan praapt karne vaale karmchaaree shashan se asantusht ho jate he or rajkeey kaaryo kii apeksha anya kaaryon main ruchi lene lagate he
 Therefore, as the merit of the worship increases, so too should his salary increase, because it ultimately interests the king himself
 seva avadhi, padonnati evam pad avnati : saamaanya sthiti main ek karmchaaree kii seva avadhi- 40 varsh sweekaar kii he, kintu iske saath hi bhrityon kii sadaiv pariksha hoti rahani chahie or avagun utpann ho jane par bhrity ko pad mukt kar dena chahie
 Shukraniti makes a clear provision for the timely promotion of employees, when a person becomes superior to his position on the basis of his experience, he should be appointed to a higher post
 iske vipareet yadi koi pradhan sevak aalasy aadi ke kaaran apane dayitvon kii upeksha karata he to use apradhan sevak bana dena chahie
 Venus has also arranged for the training of freshers
 pension, kshatipurti, bhavishya nidhi va bonus kii vyavastha : rajaseva main 40 varsh puure karne ke uparaant, sevanivritti ke baad pension rup main paisa aaajeevan diya janaa chahie
 There is not only pension but also family pension
 raaj karmchaariyon ke liye bhavishya nidhi kii yojana ko bhi sweekaar kiya hai
 The king should deduct 1 / 6 or 1 / 4 of the total amount of the salary of the personnel and deposit it with him, and after two or three years, half or full part of that deposit should be paid to the personnel
 vishram evam avkaash ke niyam : niyamit carmikon ke pratidin 12 ghante rajkaarya kii vyavastha he
 The need for providing leave to employees at appropriate intervals and in specific circumstances has been expressed and detailed rules have been formulated
 utsav aadi ke din koi kaary karmchaariyon se nahin karaayaa jaayegaa
 If any more urgent work is done, arrangements have been made to do it on the festive day as well, but there is a clear prohibition of any kind of work on the day of Shraddha
 carmikon ko pratidin nishchit interval par avkaash dene kii vyavastha bhi kii gai he
 After the employees become unwell, arrangements have been made for 'paid' and semi-paid leave
 prativarsh 15 din ke savetan avkaash ke saath swasthya avkaash kii bhi vyavastha kii he
 But when a deserving worshiper becomes ill, he must always be given half his salary, ignoring the duration of his illness
 is prakaar shukraniti pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik chintan kaa aisa granth he
 In which such a detailed and comprehensive description of the personnel system is given, and which is based on the interests of the employees
 shukr ne saamaajik jivan main shaashvat naitik mulyon ke sthaan par desh, kaal, sthiti ke anusaar hi naitik mulyon ko sweekaara he
 Venus has accepted varna and ashram system as the main basis of social organization according to ancient Indian tradition
 kintu ve manu ke samaan kathor evam ati anudaaravaadi nahin hai
 Venus has generally accepted the Varna system based on birth
 kintu iske saath hi karm ke aadhaar par varna vyavastha kaa bhi samarthan kiya he
 Venus has mentioned the traditional works of Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra - the four varnas
 or iske saath hi bataaya he ki brahman varna ke vyakti ko brahmacharya, grihasth, vanprastha evam sanyas naamak chaaron ashramon kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 But following the first three ashrams by the other three remaining varnas is sufficient
 shukr ke anusaar, vyavsaayon ke aadhaar par hi jatiyon kaa nirmaan hota he, isiilie anek jatiyon kaa nirmaan sambhav hua
 It is noteworthy that Venus has not presented the importance of varna and caste in public life like Manu etc
 theologians
 unka mat he ki varna evam jati kaa vishesh mahatv vivaah evam bhojan jaise vyavhaaron main hi he
 In the administration of the nation, Venus has considered the actions, modesty and virtue of a person more important than the varna and caste and has instructed the king to base the actions, modesty and virtues of the person in the appointment of state officials and freshers
 
 shukr ne brahmanon kii atyadhik shreshthata yaa shudra kii hinata kaa pratipaadan nahin kiya he
 From this point of view, the social system of Venus is more liberal, realistic and practical than Manu
 pracheen bhartiya parampara kaa anukaran karte hue shukr ne raja ke kar lagane ke adhikaar par do niyantran lagaae he| The king is such a praja sevak appointed by Brahma, who receives his salary as tax from the praja, so the king has the right to levy tax for the fulfillment of duty of obeying the praja
 raja ko kar nirdhaaran ke liy smriti ke niyamon kaa paalan karnaa chahie, manamaane kar nirdhaaran yaa vasuulne kaa adhikaar raja ko nahin he
 The nature of the tax as the source of the state should be such that the fruit is plucked from the tree, but the tree, leaves, twigs are not damaged
 The king should re-plant the seeds using the fruit as a gardener
 shukraniti saar main do prakaar kii kar pranali dikhaai detii he - Local tax system rashtriya kar pranali
 Shukracharya has accepted the principle of local taxation to meet local needs such as the maintenance of the city police should be maintained from the salary received from the householders
 sthaneey ke atirikt anya sabhi kar isamen shaamil he
 In this, tax policy has been accepted in the context of two periods
 saamanyakalin kar niti sankatkalin kar niti General Policy: - In the normal period, Venus has directed to impose tax keeping in view the economic potential of the people
 unka mat he ki shulk ko itani maatra main liya janaa chahie ki kar daata kii mul puunji kaa ant na ho
 The king should imitate the tendency of the gardener in the collection of the part
 kar is prakaar liya jaae ki raja evam praja donon ke hit main ho, anyaaypurvak evam adharm yukt kar nahin liya janaa chahie, aisa karne par raja nasht ho jaataa he
 The king who wants to increase his treasury, must fulfill the obligation to follow the subjects
 sankat kaaleen karaniti :- aise kaal main raja ko kar kii maatra main vruddhi karne tathaa saamanytah karmukt mado par bhi kar lagane kaa adhikaar hota he
 That is why Venus has considered the shrine and devasthan free during the normal period, but not in the time of crisis
 shukr ne kararopan ke samaan kar-mukti kii vyavastha ko bhi praja ke aarthik vikaas kii drushti se sweekaar kiya he
 Cereals and garments to be purchased for domestic consumption, milk animals for family rearing, animal tax exemption, trade loss merchants, pilgrimage baths and places of devotion for setting up new industries or new agricultural work till double the profit Go to this policy, get knowledge of Venus's public welfare policy
 yah kheti kii upaj par lagaaya jane vaala kar he
 There are 3 major grounds mentioned for the recovery of the part - shukr ke anusaar, kisi dhani kii madad se, grampal naamak bhrity kii madad se yaa matrhaar naamak adhikari kii madad se bhaag vasuul kar saktaa he
 Venus, according to the Indian tradition, refers to tax in the form of grain or cash
 jab kisaan bhaag jamaa karaae to use rajkeey mudrayukta bhaagptr diya janaa chahie
 Fee: According to Venus, the king should receive a fee from the buyer or seller, who is in a position of profit in the economic transaction, should not be fraudulent in the recovery of the fee
 aakar-kar : pracheen bharat main khanij utpaadan par lagaae jane vaale kar ko aakar kar kaha jaataa tha or ise vastu ke rup main vasula jaataa tha
 According to Venus, the king used to receive this tax at different rates on the metals produced from the mine - gold, silver, copper etc
, after deducting the expenditure on production
 jitani mahangi dhaatu, utana hi adhik aakar-kar tha
 Tax on the trident wood: For those who collect wood from the forest for fuel, this tax was charged in kind
 pashu kar : pracheen bharat main pashu paalan pramukh vyavsaay tha, atah is par kar lagane kii parampara bhi thi
 Goats, sheep, cows, buffalo, etc
 were all taxed
 dar alag-alag thi
 Interest Tax: The king had the right to receive 32th part of the moneylender's interest as tax
 awasaiya evam vyavsaayik bhoomi par kar : is bhoomi par kar kii vahi dar honi chahie jo krishi bhoomi hetu tay ho
 Passenger tax: Manu mentions the tax on the waterway, while Venus on the landway
 sadako kii raksha, marammat tathaa safai ke liye yatriyon se kar lene kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Tax on handicraftsmen and artists: According to Venus, artisans and craftsmen should get free work done on one side in a day
 kar vyavastha ke sambandh main shukraniti main pratipaadit kiye gaye nishedhaatmak evam sakaaratmak niyamon ke uparyukt vivechan se spasht he ki shukraniti main rajya kii kar vyavastha ko ‘lok kalyankari‘ rajya kii apekshaaon ke anuroop swarup pradaan kiya gaya he
 Venus, while acknowledging the importance of justice, has included evil-grace in the king's 8 prime duties
 yah nyaayik prakriya praja ko dharm paalan main madad karti he
 It is the duty of the king to decide the cases properly and get the people to follow their decision in this regard
 shukr ne nyaay ke avadharanak paksh kii utani vistrut vyakhya nahin kii he, jaisi ki kautilya ke arthshaastra or manusmriti main uplabdh he
 Venus has detailed the institutional and procedural aspect of justice
 nyaaypalika ke sanghathan, nyaayik prakriya tathaa mukademon se sambandhit pakshon ke adhikaron evam dayitvon kaa vistaar se vivechan kiya he
 Venus mentions Raja and Sabha under judicial process and 'jury' is also mentioned to assist in special cases
 shukraniti main raja ko sampoorn nyaay vyavastha kaa pramukh nirnaayak athwa sarvocch adhikari mana gaya he, kintu yah spasht kar diya gaya he ki raja nyaaypalika kaa keval aupchaarik adhyaksh he
 Venus has expected the king to observe judicial functions in accordance with the scriptures
 raja dwaara akele hi sabhaasadon kii sahmati liye bina, nirnay lene ke gambheer dushprinaamon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 Sabha - Venus has called the Central Court of the state as Sabha or Nyaya Sabha
 sabha aisa sthaan he jahaan vyakti ke loukik aacharan evam hiton kii jaanch smriti ke kanoon ke anusaar kii jaati he
 Venus has mentioned ten such tools, with the help of which the assembly is able to do justice well
 ye das saadhan hai- According to Venus, the first place in the assembly is that of the king, who presides over the assembly
 raja sabha main apana pratinidhi niyukt kar saktaa he, jise shukr ne pradvivak kaha he, jo sabha ke alaava mantriparishad kaa bhi sadsy hota he
 Venus has accepted making members of the assembly from all castes along with giving priority to the Brahmin varna
 ambika prasad vaajapeyi ne kaha he, ‘‘ shukr ne sabhaasadon ke sambandh main ek vishesh siddhanth pradaan kiya he
 Those who have a dispute should be made councilors by their business, such as - farmers in the dispute of the farmers because they are more well aware of the rules of their business
 ‘‘ shukraniti kaa yah vivaran uski nyaay vyavastha ko adhik udaar tarksangat evam yathartwaadee banaata he
 Chief Justice: This is considered the highest judicial officer after Raja
 is pad par shukr ke anusaar aisa vyakti niyukt kiya janaa chahie
 Whose knowledge of law and science is very broad and special and whose fairness and loyalty is beyond doubt
 nyaayalay kaa carmik varg va saadhan : nyaayalay ko samuchit sankhya main karmchaaree va saadhan uplabdh hone chahie anyathaa nyaayalay apana kaary sucharu rup se nahin kar sakate
 Therefore Venus is of the opinion that the same court is sacred, in which all the necessary means are available for the decision of the case
 shukraniti main nyaayadhishon ke manamaane vyavhaar kaa nishedh kiya gaya he
 Some rules have been arranged for them
 raja ko nyaay karne ke apane karttavya kaa samuchit paalan karnaa chahie tathaa nyaay karte hue vibhinn jatiyon, shreniyon or kulon kii paramparaon ko maanate hue nirnay karnaa chahie evam dharm kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 Councilors must tell the truth in the assembly
 nyaayik prakriya ke samay raja yaa nyaayadhish ko vaadi ke prati sammanpurvak aacharan karnaa chahie
 Behavior: In simple terms, behavior means 'judicial process of trial in court'
 is nyaayik prakriya dwaara hi yah maaloom hota he ki koun vyakti apradhi he or koun nirparaadhi
 Phases of behavior: Venus has accepted four stages of the trial's judicial process
 kisi bhi mukademe kii shuruuaat purvapaksh ke likhit yaa maukhik bayaan se hoti he ki mukadmaa banataa he yaa nahin
 After this, the second phase starts the counterparty
 ab nyaayalay vaadi evam prativaadee donon se hi prashn evam pratiprashn karata he
 If the court realizes that a lawsuit is actually made in terms of law, then the case enters its third stage ie the action
 anyathaa use dwitiya paad main samaapt ho jaataa he
 Under the Action Footer, various evidence presented in the case is rigorously investigated and the truth and untruth contained in the lawsuit are obtained
 shukr ne sabhi pramaanon ke do mul prakaar bataae he - Venus has considered the divine proof to be less important than the Manusha proof and hence, in the absence of any kind of Manusha evidence, the Goddess proof is justified
 nyaayik prakriya kaa chauthaa or antim charan nirnay paad he
 Venus has given 6 types of decisions - shukr ke anusaar nirnay kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi vijeta paksh ko jayapatr diya janaa chahie
 It is also recognized as a legal document
 nyaayalay main vaadi evam prativaadee donon ko hi upasthit hona chahie
 Venus has also mentioned new arrangements such as rethinking honor, bail and niyogi, unlike its predecessors
 shukr ke anusaar niyogi ko kanoon kaa gyaan hona chahie evam use niyamanusaar hi shulk lenaa chahie
 Venus has mentioned ten types of crime - these include violation of the edict, killing a woman, stealing etc
 vastutah ye 10 aparaadh rajya, samaaj, naitikta evam dharm ke viruddh aparaadh he
 Venus has mentioned 50 types of fraud in punishable offenses
 shukr ne inhen raja ke prati kiye gayi aparaadh mana he
 Venus has divided all types of crimes into four basic categories - kayik aparaadh sharir se, vaachik aparaadh vaani se, maansik aparaadh man se evam sansaarik aparaadh kisi ke saath milakar yaa sahyog se kiya jaataa he
 Venus is of the opinion that the criminal should be punished only after knowing the gravity and smallness of each crime
 shukraniti main aparaadhon kii shreniyon kaa vistrut vargeekaran kiya gaya he, jo aparaadhon ke vishay main shukraniti ke vyavasthit, vyaavhaarik va vaigyanik drushtikon ko vyakt karata he
 Shukraniti has given importance to all types of crimes, social, economic, moral, political, and administrative, and requires their retaliation
 shukraniti main saamanytah prandand na dene kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he tathaa keval rajdroh jaise gambheer aparaadh ke liye vadh kaa dand pradaan kiye jane ke auchity kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 The word 'dand' has many meanings in ancient Indian tradition
 yahaan shukr ne dand ke do arth kiye he- Although elsewhere Venus has also accepted the meaning of punishment, army, war and justice system, in fact, punishment saves people from bad conduct
 raja kii dandyukt niti sabhi kaaryo kii siddhi karaati he or dand dharmon kaa param rakshak he
 Venus, like Manu and Yajnavalkya, has accepted the following four types of punishment in the context of judicial administration or abolition of crime - shukr ke anusaar keval uttam purush evam madhyam purush ko vaakdand yaa dhikdand diya janaa uchit he, adham purushon par inkaa sudharatmak prabhaav nahin padataa he, atah ye dand inke liye nahin he
 Venus has accepted the interrelationship of crime and punishment
 jo raja aparaadh va dand ke is sambandh kaa dhyaan rakhte hue kaary karata he, usase praja santusht rahati he
 Only the culprit is punishable
 nirparaadhi sadaiv adandaneey he
 The quantum of punishment should be according to the crime
 use manamaane thug se dandit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The king should not be too harsh in punishing
 shukr ne ek hi prakaar ke aparaadh ke liai uttam, madhyam, va adham purushon ke liye alag-alag dandon kii vyavastha kii he jisase shukr kii dand niti kaa vishamtavaadi paksh spasht hota he
 But Venus has also mentioned such crimes in which punishment is given to everyone equally, such as treason
 yah ullekhneey he ki shukr ne manu kii tulana main dand ke kshetra main adhik samtawadi vyavastha ko apanaaya he
 From the point of view of modern punishment theory, it can be said that Venus has not accepted the repressive punishment principle, but the obstructive, preventive and corrective punishment principles have definitely been accepted in Venus
 shukr ne pracheen bhartiya aacharyon kii parampara ke antargat hi ‘par-raashtra sambandhon’ arthath apane rajya evam anya rajyon ke aapasi sambandhon kaa vistrut vivechan prastut kiya he
 From the point of view of study, we can divide these ideas into two major parts - shukr ne kautilya ke samaan mandal siddhanth kaa ullekh nahin kiya, parantu chaar prakaar ke rajyon ke astitv ko sweekaar kiya he
 Venus has not considered their geographical position as the basis of the classification of the states, but has considered the position of the king of the Vizigishu and his kingdom among other states
 shukr ne pararashtra niti ke sanchaalan main rajait evam shakti tatv ko paryaapt mahatv diya he
 According to him, every king considers his king's interest as practicable and when the vigorous king makes efficient use of the measures of policy and the means of shaguna mantra according to his power with respect to other states
 shukr ke anusaar, jis prakaar raja dwaara sarp, hathi tathaa singh ko apane vash main kiya jaataa he, usee prakaar se raja ko yathayogy upayon se mitra tathaa shatru ko apana vashwarti bananaa chahie
 Venus has mentioned only four traditional measures of policy - sam niti kaa prayog, mitra va shatru donon ke viruddh hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Where friendship is stronger than the policy of peace and friendship
 vahiin shatru raja ke prati bhi sahaayta va sahyog nishchit hota he
 The use of feudalism towards the enemy is to increase the mutual security of the two states
 daan niti kaa prayog bhi shatru va mitra donon ke prati kiya jaataa he
 To say to a friend king that all my things, even life, is yours, is called a donation policy towards a friend
 shatru raja ko pratyaksh dhan dena uske prati daan niti kehalaati he
 Venus has considered the use of distinction policy against her friend inappropriate, but in some situations
 shatru raja ke prati teen prakaar se bhed niti kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he - In this, differences can be created between the enemy king and his royal subjects by additional distinction
 dandniti kaa prayog bhi mitra va shatru donon ke viruddh kiya ja saktaa hai
 To warn the friend king that if he behaves arbitrarily, i will not be your friend - it is a punishment policy
 jabaki shatru raja ke dosha prakat karnaa, dhan nasht karnaa, yuddh main ksht dena uske prati dand niti he
 Though the policy of discrimination and punishment against friendly kings by Venus can be called immoral, but it is their realistic policy
 shukr ke anusaar raja ko paryaapt soch-vichaar kar hi in chaaron niti upayon kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 Venus has considered the use of goodness and charity for the most powerful enemy, goodness and distinction for more powerful than her, use of distinction and punishment for those of equal strength
 iskaa arth he - 6 gun vaali vishisht dharna
 Although Venus, like Kautilya, has not discussed these qualities in detail
 iske 6 gun nimnlikhit hai- Treaty: - Venus has considered the treaty as a means by which the powerful enemy befriends the inferior king, that is, the inferior king gets protection
 sandhi ke mahatv ko rekhaankit karte hue kaha he, ‘‘jis prakaar se ghaney kaanto se ghire hue baanson ke samooh ko koi kaat yaa ukhaad nahin saktaa he, usee prakaar se mlecchon se bhi sandhi kiye hue raja ko bhi, koi parajeet nahin kar saktaa
 "venus is the only ancient Acharya, who considers the treaty even more than the non-aryan king to fulfill his interest
 vigrah :- vigrah kaa arth he - raajaaon ke madhya shaanti va sahyog kii niti kaa ant evam tanaav va sangharsh kaa armbh
 The act by which the enemy is victimized and subjugated is called Deity
 vastutah vigrah aisi niti he, jiske dwaara shaktishaalee raja, nirbal raja ko peedit karke, use bina pratyaksh yuddh ke hi, apane anusaar chalane ko vivash karata he
 This is the reason why the wise king should not believe even the enemy bound by treaty
 indra dwaara vritrasur-vadh kaa udhaaharan dete hue shukr ne kaha he ki indra ne droh na karne kii pratigya ke saath sandhi karke bhi aisa kiya tha
 But Venus has prohibited Deity from strong enemy
 keval raksha ke liye koi vikalp shesh na hone par hi ant main vigrah ko shukr ne uchit mana he
 Yan: - When the destruction of the enemy king is necessary for the attainment of his desired interest and he is attacked for this purpose, then it is called Yan
 yaan kaa nakaaratmak uddeshy he, shatru kaa naash karnaa
 But the positive objective is to achieve economic benefits and political gains
 keval shaktishaalee raja ko nirbal raja ke viruddh hi yaan kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 Asan: - Where other Acharyos have considered the meaning of Asan - a policy of neutrality and inaction, neglecting the enemy king
 shukr ne ise shatru raja ke kile yaa nagar kii aisi sainik gheraabandi mana he, jo swayan kii raksha karte hue shatru ko apni sharton par sampark ke liye vivash kare
 The logistics line of the enemy king is destroyed by the asana
 yuddh saamagree evam bhojan saamagree idhan aadi kii kami hone par shatru paksh main aantarik asantosh utpann hota he
 And then that enemy king is forced and accept subjugation
 aashray :- jab kisi shaktishaalee shatru raja dwaara nirbal raja kaa rajya nasht kar diya jaye athwa aisi paraajay kaa sankat aa jaye to nirbal raja ko apni raksha ke liye kisi anya shaktishaalee raja kaa aashray lenaa chahie, jisase uski shakti me vruddhi ho sake
 Dual sentiment: - It literally means two bhavas being found at the same time, which are shown in a manifest form
 gupt rup main usase thik vipareet aacharan kiya jaataa he
 It is characterized by friendly friendship and hostility in secret
 sena ke sanchaalan main bhi dwaidhi bhav kaa shukr ne ullekh kiya he
 It is bipartisan to divide the army into several columns and keep the enemy in clear form about his military force
 shukr ne vyaavhaarik sanchaalan kii drushti se chaar pramukh sansthagat sadhano kaa ullekh kiya he - Envoy: Venus is also placed among the 10 members of the Council of Ministers by the Venus
 vah kootneeti evam videshniti se sambandhit kaaryon ko karata he
 He is such a traveling representative of the king who communicates with other kings
 atah use desh va kaal kii sthiti samajhane vaala bhaashan kala main kushal, anya kii hridayaagat bhaavana samajhane vaala evam nirbhik swabhaav kaa hona chahie
 Intelligence: In Shukraniti, there is no extensive mention of the system of intelligence like economics
 guptchar ke prakaaron ke vishay main bhi shukraniti maun he, guptchar prashasan bahya evam aantarik shatruon se raja evam rajya kii raksha kaa pramukh saadhan he
 The task of the detective is to know the behavior of the king's enemy servants and subjects and to inform the king about it
 raja ko bhi uski satyata kii pariksha karte rahanaa chahie tathaa asatywadee guptchar ko dandit karnaa chahie
 Army: According to Venus, army is a group of people, animals etc
, which are equipped with weapons and weapons
 sena ke kaaran hi shatru kaa naash sambhav hota he tathaa kosh, rajya va parakram kii vruddhi hoti he
 Venus has also considered military discipline and code of conduct
 raja ko sadaiv aise praytn karne chahie ki uski sena main bhed utpann na ho jabaki shatru sena main avashya hi bhed utpann ho
 The soldiers should also get the benefit of victory in war and keep them satisfied by participating in the spoils
 yuddh : shukr ne bahya chunautiyon se raksha ke liye or apane rajya ke vistaar ke liye yuddh kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar kiya he
 All kings aspire to expand the kingdom
 isliye paraspar shatruta bhi rakhte he
 According to Venus, when various measures of policy and even the mantra of mantra were not successful, then war should be adopted as the ultimate means
 shukraniti pracheen bhartiya granthon main sambhawatah ek maatr granth he, jisamen yuddh ko paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 According to Venus, the use of weapons by two kings is a war in a mutually hostile way
 shukr ne yuddh main naitik niyamon ke paalan evam ulanghan ke aadhaar par, do prakaar ke yuddh kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Religion, war and diplomacy
 shukr ne dharm-yuddh ke naitik niyamon kaa vivaran diya he
 But, like Manu, he has not endorsed the superiority of the Dharma war over the Kootyuddha
 shukr kaa spasht mat he ki dharm yuddh yaa kuta yuddh jisamen shatru kaa vinaash ho vahi uchit he
 In fact Venus has given preference to the war of religion over the pseudo-religion by adopting a realistic approach
 shukr ne yuddh ko paapapurna evam jaghanya krity nahin mana, apitu ullekh kiya he ki yuddh main marane par kshatriya ko uttam fal kii prapti hoti he
 The urge for Kshatriyas to consider war as a sacred duty expresses the expectation of Venus not to flee the war when the opportunity comes
 parajeet paksh ke prati vyavhaar : shukr ne yuddh main vijay ke baad vijayi raja ko vijit rajya va uski praja ke prati durbhaavnapurna kaarywahi na karne kaa paraamarsh diya he
 He instructed the victorious king to keep the subjects of the conquered kingdom happy
 shukr ne vijayi raja se apeksha kii he ki vah shatru ko jitkar yogyatanusaar usase kar grahan kare, paristhiti ke anusaar shatru ke rajya ke aadhe ansh yaa sampoorn rajya par apana aadhipaty kar le
 After that, please keep the enemy's subjects happy in every way and follow them just like your subjects
 shukr ne raja ko yah paraamarsh bhi diya he ki vah vijit rajya main karyrat mantri parishad ko hataakar apane prati nishtha rakhane vaale naveen mantri parishad kii niyukti kar de
 If he takes away the kingdom of the defeated king, then provide him, jagir etc
 for livelihood
 vijeta raja ko jite gaye rajya main swechhachari dhang se shashan nahin karnaa chahie
 He should be kept happy while protecting his daughter and make her his own
 vastutah shukr ke is vivaran main yah bhav nihit he ki parajeet rajya kii praja evam samaaj ke dharmik naitik va saamaajik mulyon kii raksha kii jaani chahie or praja kaa paalan bhi kiya janaa chahie
 Manu is basically a theological thinker, Kautilya is an economic thinker, while Venus is a political thinker
 isiilie pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik chintan main unka vishisht sthaan va mahatv he
 Altekar's view is, "there are many such information of administrative importance in Shukraniti, which is not available in any other book including economics
 yah satya he ki shukr ne rajya ke saiddhanthik pakshon kii vistaar se vivechna nahin kii he, parantu pracheen bharat main vyaavhaarik paksh par hi prakaash daalane kii parampara thi
 Venus's contribution to facilitate study can be understood as the following points - dandniti ko sarvapramukh vidya ke rup main manyata :shukr ne dandniti shastreey aushanas sampradaay kaa anukaran karte hue saiddhanthik evam dharamshastreey gyaan par vyaavhaarik va loukik gyaan kii shreshthata ko pratipaadit kiya he
 With the use of penitentiary, the king attains the attainment of all fruits, even he can establish the Satyuga
 udaar evam vyaavhaarik saamaajik-raajnneetik vyavastha kaa pratipaadan : shukr ne samaaj-sanghathan ke aadhaar ke rup main varna vyavastha ko manyata di he
 But he has supported the notion of varna system according to the order
 is prakaar shukr ne janm par aadhaarit varna vyavastha main nihit swaarth evam ayogyata kii upeksha karne kii koshish kii he or karm, yogyata va pratibha ke aadhaar par varna vyavastha ke punah nirmaan kaa vichaar diya he
 Varna and caste are important in marriage and food community life
 raashtra prashasan jaise saarvajanik va raajnneetik kaary main varna evam jati kii tulana main karmsheel va gun par aadhaarit yogyata va visheshgyata kaa hi mahatv hota he
 Compared to Manu, the views of Venus are sufficiently liberal and point to the social change that was taking place in her era
 rajya kaa savyav siddhanth : bhartiya parampara kaa anukaran karte hue ‘saptang rajya’ kii dharna ko sweekaara he
 He has compared the seven organs of the state to the parts of the human body
 shukr ne rajya ko vriksh kii bhi upama di he, rajya jaisi amoort rachana ko spasht karne kii drushti se shukr kaa yah vivaran mahatvapurn he

 yah vargeekaran pracheen bharat kii rajtantratmak samrajyavaadee shashan pranali kii ore bhi sanket detaa he
 Reflections on Rajpad in a realistic way: Venus has not considered Raja as 'man Dev' like Manu
 shukr kaa spasht mat he ki rajpad kii samast garima ke uparant bhi raja multah praja kaa sevak hi hota he or isi rup main use kar praapt karne kaa adhikaar diya he
 Venus considers praja pradhan as the basic duty of the king
 pracheen mantri parishad kaa viks : shukraniti hi ekmaatr aisa granth he, jisamen spasht rup se mantriyon ke variyata kram, unke vetan main antar, karyaalay aadi ko prakat kiya gaya he

 Venus is the only philosopher who has mentioned the state's annual plan of expenditure

 Theoretical and Realistic Explanation of per-nation Relations: While Manu is more idealistic in this field, Venus has accepted the mutual unreliability of states as the main basis of realistic relations
 unhone rajait evam shakti ke tatwon ko hi videsh niti ke sanchaalan main pramukh sthaan diya he, jo aadhunik kaal ke samaan he
 Although Venus has supported the idealistic side of the defeated king and the defeated state, the ultimate objective of such behavior is realistic
 aisi niti parajeet paksh par vijeta raja kii vijay ko sthayitv pradaan karti he
 Venus has clarified the distinction between the state and the nation and has clarified that control of the national community gives it the form of the state
 is prakaar shukr ne apane yug kii rajtantratmak shashan pranali ke antargat paae jane vaali raajnneetik vyavastha kaa vistrut vivaran prastut kiya he

 An electric generator is a device used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy
 iske liye yah praayah maikel farade ke vidyutchumbakeey preran ke siddhanth kaa prayog karti he
 The electric motor, in contrast, works by converting electrical energy into mechanical energy
 vidyut motor evam vidyut janitr main bout kuch samaan hota he or kai baar ek hi mashin bina kisi parivartan ke dono kii tarah kaary kar sakati he
 The electric generator forces the electric charge to flow through an external circuit
 lekin yah aavesh kaa srijan nahin karata
 It is like a water pump which works only to make water flow, not to produce water
 vidyut janitr dwaara vidyut utpaadan ke liye aavashyak he ki janitr ke roter ko kisi bahari shakti-sreet kii sahaayta se ghumaya jaay
 For this, the use of reciprocating engine, turbine, steam engine, water falling on a turbine or water cycle, an inlay engine, wind turbine or man or animal power can be used
 kisi bhi strot se kii gai yantric urja ko vidyut urja main parivartit karnaa sambhav he
 This energy can be obtained from the falling water of a waterfall or by the heat generated by burning coal, or from a petrol or diesel engine
 urja ke nae nae strot upyog main laae ja rahe hai
 Primarily, nuclear power has also been used extensively in the last few years for electric power and in many countries nuclear power-powered power stations have been built
 jowar bhaaton evam jwalamukhiyon main nihit aseem urja kaa upyog bhi vidyutsakti ke janan ke liye kiya gaya he
 The use of all these power tools to produce electric power is achieved only by giant electric generators, which is basically based on Faraday's' magnetic field on the conductivity principle of conductivity
 farrade kaa yah siddhant nimnlikhit rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : Thus, three main things are required for the generation of electric power: 1
 chumbakeey kshetra, jisamen chaalak ghumaya jaae, 2
 Driver and 3
 chaalak ko chumbakeey kshetra main ghumaanevaali yantric shakti
 It is also clear that to make the production of electric power practical, the driver induced VVB
 The amount should be sufficient
 isaki maatra, chaalak kii lambaai, chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata or chaalak ke veg par nirbhar karti he
 In fact it can be expressed by the following equation: jahaan, E= vidyutvahak bal, B=chumbakeey abhivah kaa ghanatv, l =chaalak kii lambaai tathaa v=chaalak kaa veg This makes it clear that in practice both the length and velocity of the conductor must be very high and the magnetic flux density should also be maximum
 chumbakeey kshetra kii adhiktam ho
 The maximum limit of a magnetic field is determined by its saturation
 chaalak kii lambaai badhanaa bhi vyaavhaarik rup se sambhav nahin, parantu ek se adhik chaalak ko is prakaar samyojit kiya ja saktaa he ki unamem prerit vi
vaa
ba
 judakar vyaavhaarik ban jaae
 In fact, the generator consists of a system of conductors in place of a conductor, which are connected to each other according to a set scheme
 in chaalkon ko dhaaran karanevaala bhaag armechar kehalaata he or inaki sangyojan vidhi ko armechar kundalan kehete hai
 As the velocity is high, the centrifugal force on the rotating conductors becomes very high, which may cause their arrangement on the armature to be disturbed
 at: inhen armechar par bane khaanpon main rakhaa jaataa he
 The armature holds the drivers and rotates them, for which its shaft is coupled to the shaft of the mechanical energy feeder
 yah yantra pani se chaalanevaala tarabine, yaa bhaap se chaalanevaala tarabine yaa ingine, ho saktaa he
 The available mechanical energy in any form can be used to rotate the shaft of the armature
 is prakaar vibhinn prakaar ke yantra janitr ko chalaane ke liye prayukt kiye jate hai
 These are called prime drivers
 vibhinn prakaar ke ingine, jaise vaashp ingine, dijal ingine, petrol ingine, gas tarabine ityadi mashine, pradhan chaalak ke rup main prayukt kii jaati hai or inaki yantric urja ko janitr dwaara vidyut urja main parivartit kiya jaataa he
 The armature is made of magnetic material, allowing it to carry a magnetic field
 saamanyat: yah ek vishesh prakaar ke ispaat kaa bana hota he, jise armechar ispaat hi kehete hai
 Electricity is also used practically to generate magnetic fields, because it can generate magnetic fields of far greater intensity than permanent magnets, and the field can be moved easily by varying the field current
 is prakaar janit voltata kaa niyantran saralata se kiya ja saktaa he
 Fields are magnets to generate magnetic fields, on which the field coil turns
 in kundaliyon main dhara ke pravaah se chumbakeey kshetra kii utpatti hoti he
 For a single sphere, the field magnets are shaped somewhat, and the armature rotates between them
 armechar tathaa kshetra chumbakon ke bich vaayu antaraal nunatam hona chahie, jisase kshetreey abhivah kaa adhikansh armechar chaalkon ko kaat sake or armechar main janit voltata adhiktam ho sake
 Current flow in the field coil is called excitation
 yah uttejan kisi bahari strot se sanyojit karne par kiya ja saktaa he athwa swayan usee janitr main utpann honevaali dhara kaa hi ek ansh uttejan ke liye bhi prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 a generator that is excited from an external source is called an external excited generator and a generator that uses part of the current generated in the same generator itself is called an automatic excited generator
 swat: uttejan kii pranaliyaan bhi kshetra kundali or armechar ke sayojanon ke anusaar bhinn bhinn hoti hai
 If the fields are connected to the coil armature in the range, it is called the range generator
 yadi donon main parshv sambandhan ho, to use shant janitr kehete hai
 If some spheres in the field of the field are related to the armature and some lateral to it, then such a generator is called a joint generator
 uttejan kii in vibhinn vidhiyon se vibhinn lakshan praapt hote hai
 The field current in the external excited generator does not depend on the armature current or the load current
 at: usamen janit voltata bhaar vicharan se swatantra hoti he
 If the field current is kept the same and the voltage generated in the generator will also remain the same
 shant janitr main bhi lagbhag aisa hi lakshan praapt hota he or bhaar vicharan kaa prabhaav janit voltata par adhik nahin hota
 In the range generator, the load current flows in the armature and field coils
 at:, yah kshetradhara bhaar par nirbhar karti he or is prakaar janit voltata bhaar badhane ke saath badhati jaati hai
 Combined generators have characteristics between shunt and range generators
 kshetra kundali ke shant or shrenee varton kaa vyavasthaapan kar unke bich kaa koi bhi lakshan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In practice only joint generators are used more
 chumbakeey kshetra main ekasmaan veg se ghoomanevaale chaalak main janit voltata, chaalak ke chumbakeey abhivah ko kaatane kii gati par nirbhar karti he
 This speed, in fact, depends on the position relative to the magnetic conductance of the conductor at any given moment
 jab chaalak ekasmaan veg se gum rahaa ho, to vah ek chakkar main do baar abhivah ke lambavat hoga or is sthiti main vah adhiktam abhivah kaatega, tathaa jab vah koi bhi abhivah nahin kaatega, do baar uske samaantar hoga
 Thus the voltage generated in a circle twice will vary between zero and maximum, as shown in Figure 3

 is prakaar ke vicharan ko prayavarti vicharan kehete hai
 a similar alternating voltage is produced in armature drivers, and a dichotomy is used to direct it
 dikparivartak armechar ke shaft par hi aropit hota he
 There are many copper blocks in it, which are insulated from each other
 armechar ke vartan ke antyasangyojan in khandon se sanyojit hote hai
 There are two burruses connecting with the transformer, which connect the current flowing through the voltage generated in the armature to the external circuit
 armechar chaalkon kaa dikparivartak se sangyojan is prakaar kiya jaataa he ki donon burushon dwaara ikatthi kii janevaali dhara ek hi disha kii hoti he
 Thus one Burush collects positive current and the other one negative
 is aadhaar par burushon ko bhi dhanatmak evam rinatmak kaha jaataa he
 In fact, Burush is the terminal of the electric current, which relates the load to the generator
 ye burushdharak par aropit hote hai or dikpavirthak par inaki sthiti burush dharak dwaara vyavasthaapit kii ja sakati he
 Zahid Qurban Alvi was the former Interim Acting Chief Minister of Sindh, a province of Pakistan
 electronics main, bahusanketak kai analog yaa digital input sanketon main se ek kaa chayan karata he or aage main chaynit input ke line me yukti karata he
 The multiplexer is used to select the n line of 2n
 Multiplexers are mainly sent over the network within a certain amount of time and bandwidth and are used to increase the amount of data
 ek bahusanketak ko ek data kaa chayankarta kaha jaataa he
 An electronic multiplexer makes one device per input signal rather than possible multiple signals to share a device or resource, for example an a / d converter or a communication line
 iske vipareet, ek bahusanket viyojak ek input sanket leti he or ek input se judaa he jo kai data-utpaadan linon main se ek kaa chayan karne ke liye ek upkaran he
 a multiplexer is often used with a complementary multiplex separator on the receiving end
 ek electronic bahusanketak ek bahu-input, ekal utpaadan switch, or ek ekal input, kai nirgam switch ke rup main ek bahusanket viyojak ke rup main mana ja saktaa he
 The schematic symbol for a multiplexer is now an isosceles trapezoid with parallel sides and the input pin and output pin are parallel sides
 sahi bahusanket viyojak par yojanabaddh chhod diya jaataa he or sahi par ek baraabar switch par ek 2 se 1 bahusanketak kaa pataa chalata he
 The SEL wire connects to the desired input to produce
 laagat me bachat The basic function of a multiplexer consists of combining multiple inputs into a single data stream
 praapt karne kii ore, ek mul kai sanketon main ekal data dhara vibhaajan hota he bahusanketak ke liye ekal kaa upyog ek hi channel par ek saath ek bahusanketak or ek bahusanket viyojak jodne ke dwaara laagat me bachat hoti he
 Its image reflects this to correct
 is maamle main, prayek data strot ke liye alag-alag channelon lagu karne kii laagat laagat or bahusanketan kaaryon pradaan kii asuvidha se adhik he
 At the end of receiving the data, a complementary multiplex separator normally gives the message needed to break a data flow back down to the original streams
 kuch maamalon main, dur ke ant system bahusanket viyojak kaa tark maujuud he, jabaki yah vastav main shaareerik rup se kabhi nahin ho saktaa, ek saadhaaran bahusanket viyojak or itane se bhi adhik kaaryakshmata ho saktaa he
 a multiplexer specifies the number of IP network users and then immediately reads the contents of the entire link in its routing processor that goes directly into a router and then converts it directly into the IP from where the multiplex separator in memory helps
 Is often a multiplexer and multiplex separator together in a piece of equipment, which is generally known simply as a "multiplexer" The rich
 sabase sanchaar pranaaliyon donon dishaao main sanchaarit hota he kyonki upkaran ke donon tukdon ko ek transmishan link ke donon siron par kii jarurat he
 In Nenalog circuit design, a multiplexer connects a signal selected from multiple inputs to a single output
 This is a special type of analog switch
 digital bahusanketak In digital circuit design, selector wires are of digital value
 uskaa kaa ek tark mulya utpaadan karne ke liye I_1 conect hota he, jabaki ek 2 se 1 bahusanketak ke maamle main, 0 se tark mulya utpaadan karne ke liye I_0 conect hota he
 In larger multiplexers, the number of selector pins is equal
 udhaaharan ke liye, 9-16 aadaanon koi kam se kam 5 chayankarta pin kii aavashyaktaa hogi 4 chayankarta pin or 17-32 aadaanon kii tulana main kam nahin kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 The binary value expressed on these selector pins determines the selected input pin
 shrinkhalan bahusanketak Larger multiplexers can be constructed using smaller multiplexers by chaining them together
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek 8 se 1 bahusanketak do se 1 4- or ek 2 se 1 bahusanketako ke saath banaaya ja saktaa he
 Two 4 to 1 multiplexers are brought into the exterior with selector pins at 2 to 1 equal to 8, which is inserted in parallel to give the total number of 3 selector inputs

 Anyone who has studied animal life by traveling around the world knows that the distribution of animals in the world is not the same everywhere, although animals are found in every corner of the world
 sansar ke har bhaag ke jantu uske apane hote hai, arthath austrailia main paae janevaale jantu bharat main nahin paae jate or bharat main paae janevaale jantu europe main nahin milte
 Perhaps one reason for this is that animals have less adaptive power
 isaliye ek bhaag kii jalwaayu main panapanevaale praani duusare bhaag kii jalwaayu main punap nahin pate
 Sometimes it is also the case that there is a suitable environment for the animal of a particular caste, but it cannot reach there due to special obstacles
 kuch aise bhi jaanavar hai jo apane aadi nivasasthaan ko chhodkar duusare deshon ko chale gaye or vahaan bhalee-bhanti panape, jaise khargosh austrailia main, nevala jameka main or angreji spairo america main
 The study of distribution of animals is called animal-expansion-science
 yah jantushastra kii ek vishesh shakha he
 Zoology is studied in many ways
 pehle jaanwaron ke vistaar kaa adhyayan prithvi kii sataha par kiya jaataa he, jise bhugolic vistaar yaa kshaitij vistaar kehete hai
 After this, we study the expansion of animals from the top of the mountain to the depth of the sea
 ise urdhwadhar yaa sheershalamb sambandhi vistaar, athwa udagr vistaar kehete hai
 Both these expansions are called extension of leisure
 iske atirikt jaanwaron ke ""kaal main vistaar"" kaa adhyayan bhi kiya jaataa he, jise bhuvaigyanik bistaar kehete hai
 It is studied with the help of geology
 prayek praani kaa adhyayan teenon pakshon ke antargat ho saktaa he, parantu jantuvistaar kaa puraa gyaan praapt karne ke liye teenon pakshon kaa alag alag adhyayan karnaa aavashyak he
 In the last hundred years, there have been several attempts to divide the earth into several parts based on the population of animals
 lindkar ne prithvi kii sari sataha ko teen pramukh kshetron main baanta tha : Of these, Neogia separated from the rest of the world in the Third Age and the Australian Territory at the beginning of the Third Age

 pahaad kii chotii se samudr ke tal tak jalwaayu ke kai str milte hai
 Animal group of every type of climate is different
 isaliye pahaad kii oonchaai se lekar samudr kii gaharaai tak ke jaanwaron ke vistaar kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Such expansion is called bathymetric distribution
 kuch lekhakon na bathemetric vitaran ko do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya he, ek he gaharaai sambadhi, arthath jaleey or doosraa he oonchaai sambandhi, arthath altitudinal vistaar 
 For the study of bathymetric expansion, three biographical divisions have been made: 1
 bhoomijivi jantu prithvi par rahanevaale hai
 Animals are mentioned from the sea shore to the top of the mountain
 inamen praaia: aise pranismoohon kaa ullekh hota he, jinpar oonchaai kaa prabhaav padataa he
 2
 In seaside aquatic animals refer to animals living in clean water
 svachh jal ke nivaasiyon kii sankhya kam he
 There are very few invertebrates in them, especially in flowing water
 kuch badi badi jhilein hai, jinamein jal kaa dabaav adhik he or prakaash bhi andar nahin ja paata, par unamem rahanevaale praaniyon main ye visheshtaayen nahin hotin, jo samudr main rahanevaale praaniyon main hoti hai
 3
 Sea creatures refer to sea creatures
 prithvi kaa lagbhag 72 pratishat kshetra samudr se ghira hua he
 The creatures in the sea are from very old times
 pattharon par ankit praaniyon ke jo jeevashm milte hai, ve adhiktar samudri praaniyon ke hai
 From this, it is inferred that development occurred only among the creatures living in the sea, because these creatures had the opportunity to live in the same environment for a long time
 aadhunik samay main bhi yadi dekha jaae to praaniyon ke kai samuh, jaise tenophora, brackeopoda, policyta, sephalopoda, tunikata hai, jo keval samudr main hi milte hai
 Heat does not change in the sea area
 jal kaa khaaraapan har sthaan par praaia: ek samaan he or viley gas bhi har sthaan par ek jaisi maatra main milti he
 This region is also divided into four parts: inamen se kabhi-kabhi lekhak pehle do kaa varnan litoral ke antargat karte hai
 The strand is called the sea shore
 yah prithvi or samudr ke bich parivartanwala kshetra he
 From this place, twice a day, the tides come back from the earth and open the living beings
 chunki iskaa sambandh jowarbhata se he, isliye ise jowarbhata sambandh kshetra bhi kehete hai
 To protect themselves from drying out, the animals of this part close their armor, or enter the floor by making a bill
 inamen kuch aise praani bhi hote hai, jo jal main athwa hav main saans le sakate hai
 Flat sea is called shallow sea
 yah utarate hue jowarbhata ke us chihn se prarambh hota he, jahaan se jal samudr kii ore nahin jaataa
 It has the same action of sea waves and is about 600 feet deep
 yah mahatvapurn bhaag he
 In this, light, vegetation and floor are all three things, on which animal life depends
 isko logon ne vikaswad kaa kshetra mana he
 Light also enters below shallow water
 par flats si vibhaag ke neeche tal nahin miltaa
 All the creatures in it live without a floor
 isliye ye sadaa laharon ke saath aayaa jaaya karte hai
 The depth to which light can reach the sea, the part to that depth is called the pelagic part
 pilagic ke upree bhaag main taap badalata rahata he or laharon kii uthal-puthal rahati he
 The water below remains constant and the temperature is low
 is bhaag main kuch praani hai, jo jal main tairte rahete hai or jinhen jal yahan vahaan le jaataa he
 Such zoology is called plankton
 is bhaag main kuch aise bade praani bhi hote hai, jo laharon ke viruddh ja sakate hai
 These are called Nectons
 machhlee, hwel aadi aise praaniyon ke udhaaharan hai
 Floating flora is also found in this part
 praaia: sarvatra pilagic bhaag kaa jal ek jaisaa hota he, isliye is bhaag kaa failaav adhik hota he
 The Plancton body represents many different kinds of beings
 is samooh ke jantu praaia: chote hote hai, jisase inke sharir ke andar or baahar kaa drav padaarth ek jaisaa hota he or donon kaa taap bhi ek jaisaa hota he
 Its weight is very less
 yadi bhaar adhik hua to andar hawa ke bulbule bhare rahete hai, yaa tel kii boonde, jisase va jal main tairte rahete hai
 Their armor is thin
 kuch jatiyon ke andon main tairne kii vishesh vyavastha heti he
 Plactan animals are not good swimmers; Most do not know how to swim
 500 meter kii gaharaai ke jaanavar, visheshkar machhliyaan, prakashotpadak hoti hai
 Surface creatures are transparent
 jahaan prakaash dhoomil he, vahaan ke praani rupahale hote hai or adhik gaharaai main rahanevaale jaanavar gadhe rang ke hote hai
 Necton creatures live mostly in groups
 udanevaali machhliyaan, hwel evam dolphin aadi iske achche udhaaharan hai
 All Satudras with depths greater than 100 fathoms fall in the Abyssal region
 yah pilagic ke baad prarambh hota he
 The climate of this region is absolutely stable
 yahan ke jaanavar tali kii naram keechad par, yaa keechad main rahete hai
 The water here is cold and lightless
 upar kii laharon kaa prabhaav bhi yahan nahin hota
 At this depth, the water pressure is high
 jyon-jyon gaharaai badhati he, chooney kii maatra kam hoti jaati he or carbon dioxide kii maatra badhati jaati he; phir bhi itnaa oxigen hota he ki praani bhalee-bhanti rah saken
 There are also some places like the Black Sea, whose water does not get enough oxygen
 is kshetra main keval prakashotpadak praaniyon kaa hi prakaash miltaa he
 The animals here are particularly large
 kuch kekade itane bade hote hai ki unka vyas 3 meter hota he
 There are some animals of Hydra shape, which are 2
5 meters in length, although the Hydra itself is only about eight millimeters in length

 His body is lifted from the stalk
 crustesian ke sharir par lambey kaante, kade bal or lambey sparshak hote hai
 Crustaceans living in deep water are red, but other inhospitable beings are blue or purple
 gaharaai main rahanevaali machhliyon main ankhen nahin hotin
 There are also angler fishes, which have large mouths and long thorns on the body
 molska kii shrenee main yahan bade-bade octopus evam squid hote hai
 Since the atmosphere at this depth is constant, there are no rapid developmental changes here
 jis tarah sataha par jantuon ke vistaar kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he, usee prakaar jantuon ke kaal main vistaar kaa bhi kiya jaataa he
 From now, there were 10 thousand or 15 thousand years ago, there were cas, it is studied with the help of geology
 isiilie ise bhuvaigyanik vistaar kehete hai
 The surface of the earth is not like it was before
 usapar parat ke parat jamate ja rahe hai
 Even the animals which fell in the middle of the layers, their fossils can still be dug out
 inaki sahaayta se vikaswad kaa adhyayan puraa ho sakaa he
 Fossil-proofs of evolution have been found in fragments, but have also been found elsewhere, such as the fossils of modern horse development have been found, which indicate the sequence of development of horses
 isi tarah orchioptarics kaa jeevashm he, jisamen chidiyon ke lakshan hai or uragon ke bhi
 This proves that the birds developed from the Uragas
 bhuvaigyanik drushti se samay ko chha: kalpon main baanta gaya he or prayek kalp ko anya chote chote kaalbhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Those are called periods
 pehla jeevahin kalp ke naam se abhihit he
 This kalpa lasted for about 1,00,00,00,000 years
 saadhaaran jeevotpatti duusare kalp main hui, jiskaa naam archiozoik he
 Fossils of this period are not obtained
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki praarambhik praani atyant sukumaar tathaa chote the, isaliye unhone koi chihn nahin chode
 The name of the third kalpa is prajiv kalpa
 is kaal ke jeevashm bahut achche nahin hai, parantu aisa anumaar he ki adhiktar aprishthvanshi praani is samay main viksit ho chuke the
 The main reason for arriving at this determination is that since its time, there are good fossils of illiterate beings
 iske pashchaat purajeevkalpa kaal aata he
 It is divided into six periods
 pratham avadhi cambrian kehalaati he
 After that come Ardovician, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian respectively
 cambrian main aprishthvanshi praaniyen kii bahutayat he
 Trilobites and Brachiopodus are more
 ordovisian main aprishthvanshi prani kaa utkarsh or machhliyon kaa janm ho gaya
 Armored fish were also born
 silyurian main badi-badi coral rif paidaa ho gai thim
 Brachiopods flourished, but trilobites began to decrease
 is kaal main machhliyaan bhalee-bhanti milti hai
 Lung fishes are also found
 devonian machhliyon kaa kaal kehalaata he
 Molluscs were higher in this period
 ubhaycharon kaa bhi janm ho gaya tha
 Thus vermin-born beings were born on earth for the first time in this period
 is avadhi ke ye teenon bhaag is kaaran visheshkar mahatvapurn he
 In Carboniferous which comes after the Devonian, there was an abundance of flora and corals
 kiton kaa vikaas bhalee-bhanti ho chukaa tha
 The brancopods were beginning to dissolve
 badi-badi shark machhliyaan tathaa fefdevaali anya machhliyaan adhik thim
 Primarily it was the era of amphibians
 isamen bade bade ubhaychar the
 Urags were born from them
 carbonipheras ke pashchaat parmian yug aayaa
 In this period there were many fish, amphibians and lizards
 makadi, bichchhu, goger, ghonghe or puraatan keet is yug main bahut the
 The Mesozoic kalpa came after the pragyav kalpa
 yah urag kaal kehalaata he
 Some Uragas were bigger than elephants
 isi yug ke urag pakshiyon main parivartit hue
 This kalpa is divided into three periods
 ye hai tritisik, jurysik or criteshas 
 In the Triassic there was a decrease of marine invertebrates and the growth of large UG dinosaurs
 jurysik main aadhunik crustesian paidaa ho gaye tathaa amonites bahut ho gaye
 Birds and flying birds are also found during this period
 criteshas yug main amonites lupt ho gaye
 Great eggs also began to dissolve and Tilliostian fishes grew
 antim kalp ko kenozoik kalp kehete hai yah aadhunik praaniyon kaa kaal he
 It is divided into two periods
 ek he tritiy yug or doosraa chaturth yug 
 There are many parts of the third era
 sabase pehle bhaag ko aadi nutan kaal kehete hai
 In this, the underdevelopment of mammals started and mammals with umbilical cord were born
 inamen ghode kaa praathmik rup iohippas bhi he
 The second part is called the modern era
 isamen stanadhariyon kii vruddhi hui
 The second category of animals and horses, between cat, dog and bear, were also Mezohippus and Myohippus
 bandar tathaa ap bhi isi kaal main paidaa hue hai
 The third part, undernutrition, is the period of growth of mammals
 inaki sankhya evam rup donon main vruddhi hui he
 In the fourth part extreme, the transformation of monkey-like beings into human beings started directly
 chaturth yug sabase aadhunik kaal ko kehete hai
 The first part of it is called Abhinutan Kaal
 maanav kaa janm isi kaal main hua he
 This is the modern period
 is samay ke bane jeevashm aadhunik praaniyon se milte hai
 This proves that animals have evolved according to time or time respectively
 ardhsainik bal ardh-sanyeekaran bal hota he jiskaa sanghathanaatmak sanrachana, ranneeti, prashikshan, upsanskruti, or kaary ek peshewar sena ke samaan hota he
 But which is not included as part of the state's formal armed forces
