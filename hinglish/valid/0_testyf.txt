 Since two-position electronic gates represent these numbers very easily, this method is used extensively in computer hardware and software
 dwayadhari sankhyaon ko dashamalav numberon main badalane ke ganitiya tareeke hote hai
 Under this, there are many mathematical tools that allow addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and other mathematical estimation in other methods including binaries
 dwayadhari numberon se dashamalav main ankon ko badalanaa jahaan jatil he, vahiin dwayadhari ko anya vidhiyon main antaran karnaa apekshaakrit saral hota he
 The scholar Pingal of India has used the binary number method very wisely in the description of the verses
 is prakaar pingal dwayadhari sankhya paddati kaa varnan karne vaale pratham vyakti hai
 The decimal method is simple for human use, so the initial form became the same and later on, when many methods of calculation came to the fore, the decimal method was given a prominent place

 It was also used in many spiritual traditions, such as the Pythagoras school and the ancient Indian saint tradition

 The value of a binary number is calculated as follows: dwayadhari paddati main nirupit sankhya ke aage yaa peeche 'kuch' jodakar yah spasht kiya jaataa he ki sankhya dwi-aadhari he 
 All the 'groups of signs' written below represent six hundred sixty-six

 Anything else is added to the binary bases written using 0 and 1 to avoid confusion so that its basis is clear
 is prakaar, nimnlikhit sabhi nirupan ek hi sankhya ko nirupit karte hai- When binary numbers have to be pronounced in words, they are read alphabetically so that the difference from decimal numbers can be understood
 udhaaharan ke liye, binary sankhya 100 kaa uccharan 'ek shunya shunya' karenge na ki 'ek sau'
 With this the binary nature of this number is also known and 'purity' also remains
 '100', ek sau nahin he, yah keval chaar he
 Therefore it is wrong to call it 'one hundred'

 The motivations of the creation of these war poems were the same events in the history of the Baloch caste that took place in that period; Such as the 30-year struggle of the Rind and lashari tribes, the vivid tale of the immortal love of Hani-shah Murid, Beberg and Giranaz and narratives, the antics of Shahdad and Mahnaz, the valor and courage of Shahdad and his followers in the Battle of Panipat because of Humayun's friendship , The war against Beberg Pusser for the singularity of Jusur and Ghayur Balach and other similar incidents gave rise to such high-quality war poetry

 bhagwaan parswanath jain dharm ke teiswein tirthankar hai
 According to Jain texts, the descending part of the present-day Kaal Chakra, Avasarpini is dynamic and 24 Tirthankaras were born in its fourth era
 tirthankar parswanath kaa janm aaj se lagbhag 3 hajaar varsh purv varanasi main hua tha
 In Varanasi there was an Ikshvakuvanshi king named Ashwaseen
 unki rani vama ne pus krishna ekadshi ke din mahatejasvi putr ko janm diya, jiske sharir par sarpchihm tha
 Vama Devi had seen a snake in her dream once in the womb, so the son was named 'parshva'
 unka praarambhik jivan rajkumaar ke rup main vyateet hua
 One day Parshvan saw from his palace that the Poorvasi are going to the other side for the worship material
 vahaan jaakar unhone dekha ki ek tapasvi jahaan panchagni jala rahaa he, or agni main ek sarp kaa joda mar rahaa he, tab parshv ne kaha— 'dayaahin' dharm kisi kaam kaa nahin'
 Tirthankara Parshvanath had left home at the age of thirty and had taken Jaineshwari initiation and Brahmachari was unmarried
 kaashi main 83 din kii kathor tapasya karne ke baad 84wein din unhen keval gyaan praapt hua tha
 He traveled to many countries like Pundra, Tamralipta etc
 tamralipt main unke shishy hue
 Parshvanath established the Chaturvidhi Sangha, which consists of sages, aryika, shravaka, and shravika and even today the Jain society is in this form
 prayek gana ek ganadhar ke antargat kaary karata tha
 All followers, women or men, were all considered equal
 sarnath jain-aagam granthon main singhpur ke naam se prasiddh he
 It was here that Shreyansanathji, the 11th Tirthankara of Jainism was born and propagated his non-violence religion
 keval gyaan ke pashchaat tirthankar parshavnath ne jain dharm ke paanch mukhya vrath – satya, ahimsa, astey, aparigrah or brahmacharya kii shiksha di thi
 Finally, knowing his Nirvana period was near, Shree Sammed went to Shikharji where Shravan Shukla Ashtami attained salvation
 bhagwaan parswanath kii lokvyapaktaa kaa sabase bada pramaan yah he ki aaj bhi sabhi tirthankarasn kii murtiyon or chihnon main parswanath kaa chihn sabase zyada he
 Even today many miraculous statues of Parshvanath are entwined throughout the country
 jinaki gaatha aaj bhi puraane log sunaate hai
 It is believed that most of the ancestors of Mahatma Buddha were also followers of Parshvanath religion
 
 The Jain texts describe the Tirthankara Parshvanatha for nine previous births
 pehle janm main brahman, duusare main hathi, tisare main swarg ke devtaa, chauthe main raja, paanchaven main dev, chhathwein janm main chakravarti samraat or saatven janm main devtaa, aath main raja or nauven janm main raja indra tatpashchaat dasven janm main unhen tirthankar banane kaa saubhaahgya praapt hua
 As a result of the accumulated virtues of previous lives and the tenacity of the tenth birth, they become Tirthankaras

 When a substance is stimulated by giving it electric or heat power, then the colors of different colors start emanating from it
 spectrograph kii sahaayta se inkaa spectrum praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 If the substance is so energized that its molecules are excited, but do not break down into atoms, then small strips, or bands, of different colors are found in the spectrum of rings emitted from them
 aise spectrum ko band spectrum kehete hai
 If too much energy is given to the substance, the molecules break down and the atoms of the substance get excited
 uttejit parmaanuon se jo spectrum praapt hota he, usamen vibhinn varna kii rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 This spectrum is completely different from the band spectrum
 band spectrum anuon se praapt hota he
 Hence it is also called 'molecular spectrum'
 aise spectrum main prayek pattee yaa band kaa ek kinaaraa adhik prakhar dikhaai detaa he
 This edge is called the band head
 band sheersh se pare pattee kii prakharata kramash: ghatati jaati he or doosraa kinaaraa banane se purv hi bahudhaa agle band kaa sheersh aa jaataa he, yaa is band kii prakharata shunya ho jaati he
 If the order of decreasing intensity is from long wave to short wave, the band is degraded to purple and if this sequence is from short to long wave, the band is called red degraded
 achche spectroscope se dekhne par gyaat hota he ki prayek band anek sookshm rekhaon kaa kramik samudaay hota he
 These lines become very dense towards the apex and progressively narrower towards the tail
 band spectrum mukhya rup se do prakaar ke hote hai, avasorana spectrum or utsarjan spectrum 
 Some vapor is absorbed by the vapor when the vapor of the substance is locked in a tube at the proper temperature and pressure, and from it the continuous channels are sent
 kisi padaarth kaa vaashp atyant ucch taap par jin rashmiyon ko utsarjit kar saktaa he unheen rashmiyon ko vah kam taap par avashoshit karata he
 Therefore, dark black bands are found in the continuous spectrum of rocks coming out of the tube
 aise spectrum ko avasorana spectrum kaha jaataa he
 In many gases, band spectrum is also obtained by electrifying at low pressure
 inhen utsarjan spectrum kehete hai
 They are converted into vapor to obtain absorption and emission band spectrum from solids and liquids
 bahut se padaarth parabangnee kirnon ke prabhaav se chamakane lagate he or unase drishy prakaash nikalne lagata he
 This is called fluorescence and phosphorescence

 First, in 1885, delandre attempted to formulate the wavelengths of the bands at the top of the molecular spectrum, and formulate a table, called the delandre array, to fit them as a rule
 spectrum ke jin bandshirshon kii tarang sankhyaayein ek hi sarini main rakhi ja sakati hai, ve sabhi band milakar ek bandpranali banaate hai
 Small clusters of bands are found in each system
 inhen dilandre sarini kii kisi ek hi pankti yaa ek hi kollam main bharaa ja saktaa he
 These small groups are called band sequences
 prayek band anek rekhaon kaa kramik samudaay hota he
 These lines become clear when taking a photo of a band from a spectrograph with high deflection and resolution, and can be formulated into two, or more, two categories
 jin dwiparmanuk anuon ke parmaanu halke hote hai, unke band kii rekhaayen apekshaakrit viral hoti hai

 ped-paudhon yaa vanaspatilok kaa arth he, kisi kshetra kaa vanaspati jivan yaa bhoomi par maujuud ped-paudhe or iskaa sambandh kisi vishisht jati, jivan ke choop, rachana, sthanik prasar, yaa anya vanaspatik yaa bhugolic gunon se nahin he
 This word is much larger than the word Flora which is especially related to the caste structure

 Ancient redwood forests, coastal evergreen forests, moss-growing mosses, desert soil layers, roadside grasses, wheat fields, orchards, orchards — all these are included in the definition of trees
 ped-paudhe biosphere ke mahatvapurn kaaryon main har sambhav sthanik paimaanon par sahaayak hote hai
 First, trees and plants control the flow of many biogeochemicals, especially the cycles of water, carbon, and nitrogen — they also have enormous importance in local and world energy balance
 aise chakra na keval vanaspati ke vaishvik, balki jalwaayu ke bhi swaroopon ke liye mahatvapurn hote hai
 Secondly, trees also strongly affect soil properties, including soil volume, chemicality, and texture, which in turn affect various vegetation properties, including productivity and composition
 tisare, ped-paudhe is grah par maujuud jantuon kii vishaal sarani ke liye vanyajiwan awaas or urja ke strot kaa kaam karte hai
 Perhaps the most important, but often overlooked, factor is that the global flora is a major source of oxygen in the environment, which facilitates the emergence and maintenance of oxygen-dependent metabolic systems
 ]] Most of the work on classification of vegetation has been done by European and North American ecologists and their methods are also radically different
 uttar america main vanaspati ke prakaar nimna maapdandon ke sanyukt rup par aadhaarit hai – jalwaayu ke pratimaan, paudhon ke awaas, phenology or / yaa vikaas ke prakaar or pradhan jati
 vartmaan yues maanak main vargeekaran padanukramit he or non florischik maapdandon ko upree maapdandon main keval nichle do staron main hi samavisht karata he
 In Europe, taxonomy often relies mostly and sometimes entirely on floristic structure, without explicitly speaking about climate, phenology, or patterns of development
 yah akasar sankethik yaa naidanik jati par jor detaa he jo ek prakaar ko duusare se alag karti he
 In the FGDC standard, the hierarchy levels, from the simplest to the most specific, are - mechanisms, classes, subclasses, groups, designs, matches, and relationships
 The lowest level, or relation, is most correctly defined and incorporates the names of one to three major castes of one type
 udhaaharan ke liye, varg ke str par kisi vanaspati prakaar kii paribhaasha, "van, canopi cover> 60% " ho saktaa he, banaavat ke str par, "jaade kii varsha, chaude pattey vaala, sadabahaar, sclerophillas, closed canopi van"; mail ke str par, "arboots menijee van"; or sambandh ke str par, "'arboots menjisi -lithocarpus denciflora van ", kaha jaataa he, jo california or origan, uese main paae jane vaale pacific madrone-tanok van hai
 In practice, levels of match and / or kinship are most commonly used, particularly in vegetative mapping, just as Latin binomials are most commonly used when discussing topics of race in taxonomy and general conversation
 austrailia main victoria main vanaspati ko paristhitivaigyanik vanaspati varg ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 Like all biological systems, vegetative society is topical and spatially moving
 ye har sambhav paimaanon par badalte rahete hai
 Mobility in vegetation is mainly defined as caste composition and / or vegetation composition
 samayik rup se, anek prakaar kii prakriyaayein yaa ghatnaayen parivartan laa sakati hai kintu saralata ke liye unhen achaanak yaa dhimi shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he
 Sudden changes are commonly called disturbances - these include events like wildfires, strong winds, landslides, floods, avalanches
 inke kaaran saadharantah samudaay ke baahar hote hai—ye prakritik prakriyaayein hoti hai jo samudaay kii prakritik prakriyaaon se swatantra hoti hai
 Such events can bring changes in vegetation composition and caste structure for a very fast and long time period and can affect vast area
 aise bahut kam paritantr hai jinamein niyamit rup se or baar-baar kisi tarah ke updrav nahin hote or ye har dirghakaalik gatisheel tantra kaa hissaa hote hai
 Fire and wind infestations are particularly common in many plant types around the world
 aag khaas taur par prabal hoti he kyonki yah na keval jivit ped-podhon balki bijon, bijaanuon or jivit meristemon, jo agali peedi kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, ko bhi nasht kar sakati he or jeev-jantuon, mitti ke gunon or anya paritantreey tatwon va prakriyaaon ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 
 dhimi gati se samayik parivartan sarvyaapee hota he –isamen paritantreey aavartan kaa kshetra nihit hota he
 a combination of rotational composition and classification is a relatively slow change that arises over time due to modifications brought by vegetation itself to various variable components of the environment such as light, water, and nutrition levels
 ye sanshodhan kisi bhi kshetra main badhane, bachane or prajnan main sarvaadhik yogya jati ko badal dete hai, jisase flora main parivartan hote hai
 These fluoristic changes cause cognitive changes that occur naturally even in the absence of caste changes in plant growth, causing slow and predictable changes in vegetation
 aavartan main kisi bhi samay updrav dwaara rukawat ho sakati he jisase tantra waapas apni purv dasha main laut jaataa he yaa or kisi maarg par chal padataa he
 This can cause recurring processes to reach or not reach a stable, final state
 iske alaava, aisi dashaon ke gunon kii bhavishyavaanee, bhale vah na ghate, hameshaa sambhav nahin he
 In short, vegetation communities depend on many variables that together determine the limits of possibilities for future conditions
 vanaspati vaigyanik sthanon or samay ke vibhinn paimaanon par vanaspati main dekhe jane vaale prakaaron or prakriyaaon ke kaarnon kaa adhyayan karte hai
 Questions regarding the relative roles of climate, soil, topography and history on the characteristics of vegetation, including composition and composition of castes, are of particular interest and importance
 aise prashn akasar bade paimaane par hote hai or isaliye kisi jod-tod ke prayog dwaara aasaani se arthpurna tareeke se hal nahin kiye ja sakate

 Botany originated in the 18th century, or in some cases earlier, the work of botanists and / or naturalists
 inamen se anek khoj ke yug main khoj kii yatra par nikle vishwa yatri the or unka kaary vanaspatishaastra or bhugol kaa sanshleshit sanyog tha jise aajkal ham vanaspatik biogiography kehete hai
 At that time there was little information about floristic or vegetation types around the world and little was known about whom they depended, so much of the work was limited to collecting, classifying and naming plant specimens
 19veen shatabdi tak bahut kam saidhantik kaary hua
 Alexander von Humboldt, who was among the earliest working naturalists, collected 60,000 botanical specimens during his five-year trip to South and Central America from 1799 to 1804
 Humboldt was one of the first scientists to document the relationship between climate and vegetation patterns in his monumental life-long work, "vise to the Equinational Regions of the New World" - which he wrote in collaboration with fellow botanist Amy Bopland 
 Humboldt described the vegetation in a physiognomic manner in addition to Texanami
 unke kaary ne paryaavaran-vanaspati ke sambandhon par gahan kaary kii shuruuaat kii jo aaj tak chaalu he
 
 aaj kal hone vaale naspati adhyayan kaa prarambh 19veen sadi ke ant main europe or rus main, visheshkar ek pole, jojeff packjoski or ek roosi, liyonti remenski ke dwaara hua
 Together they were far ahead of their time and they introduced or described almost all the important topics of today, long before the West
 in vishyon main vanaspati samudaay vishleshan, yaa phitososhiolaji, gradiant vishleshan, aavartan or vanaspati ekophizialaji or functional ikalaji par lekh shaamil the
 Most of the world, especially the English-speaking world, did not know much of their work until the 20th century through language and / or political factors
 united stats main henry cols or fredrick klements ne 20veen sadi ke shuru main vanaspati aavartan ke vichaaron kaa vikaas kiya
 Clement is now famous for describing the botanical community as an invalid superorganism 
 usne tark pesh kiya kijaise kisi vyakti main sabhi avyav tantra milakar kaam karke sharir ke acchhee tarah se kaam karne main madad karte hai or jo vyakti ke vayask hone ke saath milakar viksit hote hai, usee tarah vanaspati samudaay main bhi har jati atyant kade samanvay or talmail ke saath viksit hoti he or paraspar sahyog karti he or vanaspati samudaay ko ek paribhaashit or purvaniyat ant sthiti kii ore dhakelti he
 Although Clements did much work on North American flora, his devotion to superorganism has shaken his reputation, as his work has not been supported by many researchers
 klements ke pratikul, anek paristhiti vaigyanikon ne darshaya he ki vaiyaktik pariklpana, jo kahati he ki vanaspati samudaay paryaavaran ke prati pratikriya kar rahi jatiyon ke ek samooh kaa kul jamaa he, sahi he or samay or sthaan main ek saath ghatati he
 Remensky presented the idea in Russia, and in 1926 Henry Gliasson developed it in a paper in the United States
 klementsian ke vichaaron kaa itnaa adhik prabhaav tha ki gliyasana ke vichaaron ko kai saalon tak asweekaar kiya gaya
 But in the 1950s and 60s, Robert Whitaker's series of well-crafted studies offered compelling evidence for Gliasson's arguments
 One of the most qualified American botanical scientists, Whitaker was a developer and proponent of gradient analysis in which pluralities of individual species are measured in front of measurable environmental transformers
 teen atyant bhinn monten paritantron ke adhyayanon main, whitaker ne dikhaaya ki jatiyaan mukhyatah paryaavaran ke sammukh pratikriya karti hai or anya saath main maujuud jatiyon se uskaa koi samanvay nahin hota
 anya kaary visheshkar peliobaatani par kiya gaya kaary bade samayik or sthanik paimaanon par is vichaar ko samarthan detaa he
 Since the 1960s, much of the research on flora has focused on topics of functional ecology
 kaaryaatmak dhaanche main, vargikaraniya vanaspatishaastra kaa kam mahatv hota he or sari khojbin jatiyon ke akritik, sharir-rachana or sharirkriyaatmak vargeekaran par kendrit rahati he or iskaa uddeshy yah bhavishyavaanee karnaa hota he ki vishisht samooh vibhinn paryaavarniya parivartakon ke prati kaise bartaav karenge
 is tarah ke drushtikon kaa aadhaar yah dharna he ki kendrabhimukh vikaas or anukulit vikiran ke kaaran visheshkar filogenetic vargeekaran ke ucch staron or bade sthanik paimaanon par akasar filogenetic apeksha or paryaavarniya anukulan ke bich majboot sambandh nahin hota he
 Functional classification began in the 1930s with the division into plant groups based on the location of Ranchier's epicycle meristems
 iske baad anya vargeekaran jaise macarthar kaa - aar prati ke – chuninda jati or grime dwaara prastaavit si-es-aar yojana, jisamen jatiyon ko teen main se ek yaa adhik ranneetiyon ke anusaar, prayek kaa paksh ek chuninda dabaav dwaara lekar-pratispardhi, dabaav ko sahane vaale or rudrals main baanta gaya he
 Functional classification is important in the composition of plant – environment interactions, which have been the main theme in botany ecology over the past 30 years
 aajkal vishwa jalwaayu badlaav, visheshkar taapmaana, varsha or updrav main parivartanon kii pratikriya main sthaneey, kshetreey or vaishvik vanaspati parivartanon kii rachana par bahut jor diya ja rahaa he
 The examples of functional taxonomy given above, which divide all vegetation species into very small groups, are less likely to affect the various constructive objectives that lie ahead
 yah aam taur par mana jaataa he ki saral, sarv-uddeshyak vargikarnon ke sthaan par adhik vistrut or kaaryaatmak vargeekaran aa jaaenge

 "for" ṭ "

 hantarian main agar kahin bhi nihit 'a' ki dhwani ho to use spasht rup se 'a' likhaa jaataa he
 If modified, it is represented using punctuation in some modified Hunterian methods

 The characterization of the Unix system has been done by various concepts: the use of simple text for data storage, hierarchical file systems, treatment tools and some kind of inter-communication process in the form of files and the use of a large number of software tools, small programs one order
 Can be tied together using pipes through a line interpreter, as opposed to a monolithic program in which All the same functionality is included

 But to run the game, a more efficient machine was needed, and eventually a small-used PDP-7 at Bell Labez made it work
 It was a game-related task that apparently led to the birthplace of Unix, a PDP7 in Bell Labs
 Because Multix's learning was ending soon and management was not interested in purchasing any machines in advance of the programmer's objective
 For development
 spes travel khel dwaara prastut kiye gaye PDP7 par, thomson or richi ne, rudd kanade sahit vikasko ke ek dal kaa netritv kiya, bel leboratories main
 unhone ek vargeekrut sanchika tantra viksit kiya,computer prakrion or upkaran filon ke vichaar or ek cmand-line dubhashiya,or kuch chote upyogita programmes In the 1970s, Brian Kernighan discovered a project called Unix for the Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, Games on Multics
 See Uni and Multi Prefixes Operational mechanisms can support multiple users simultaneously, so when Unix could eventually support two users simultaneously, it was renamed Unix
 is kshan tak bel leboratories se koi vittiya sahaayta nahin di gai thi
 When the computer science research group wanted Unix to be used for a much larger machine than the PDP-7, Thomson and Ritchie managed to connect Unix to the PDP-11 / 20 machine for text processing capability in promising business
 isane bel se kuch vittiya sahaayta ke liye baadhya kiya
 First in 1970, the Unix operating system was officially named and ran on the PDP-11 / 20
 isane ek paath swarupan kramadesh joda jise roff or paath sampadak kehete hai
 All three were written in PDP-11 / 20 assembly language
 bel labs ne unics, roff or sampadak se bane is praarambhik "paath sansaadhan pranali" ko pratyaksh anuprayogon ke paath sansaadhan ke liye istemaal kiya
 Roff quickly evolved into trough, the first electronic publishing program to establish a type with full capacity
 The rule book of the Unix program was published on 3 November 1971

 "the migration of the higher-level language c from the Kodaratan language resulted in more portable software, requiring only a relatively small addition of machine dependent code that had to be replaced when Unix had to move to other computing platforms
 AT and t unics vishvavidhyalayon or vyavsaayik fermon ke liye uplabdh karwaai gayi he, saath hi saath license ke adheen sanyukt rajya sarkaar ke liye

 Copies of annotated Unix kernel sources circulated widely in the late 1970s, including The Lyons' Commentary on the Lyons Commentary on Unix 6th Edition source code, resulting in widespread use of Unix, As an educational example
 unics pranali ke sanskaran ke upyogkarta niyam-pustak ke sanskaran dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye
 For example, both "fifth Edition Unix" and "unix Version: 5" are designated the same version
 san 1975 tak 4, 5 or 6 sanskaran ke jari hone ke saath hi vikaas vistrut ho gaya
 These editions added the concept of pipes leading to a more modular code base and faster development cycle
 With version 5, and version 6 in particular, there was an additional flow of versions of Unix, including both p PWB / Unix and the first commercial unix, IS / 1, both inside and outside Bell Labourtris

 Despite early progress, standardization efforts collapsed in the "unix War", with various companies forming rival standardization groups
 The most successful Unix-related standard changed to ieee's POSIX specification, in agreement with the API immediately implementing it on both BSD and System v platforms, soon assigned by the United States government to many of its systems published in 1988

 Later, AT&T and a group of other licensees formed a group "unix International" with the aim of opposing OSF
 The conflict between competing vendors again gave rise to this phrase "unix war"

 By 1993, most commercial vendors had changed their version of Unix, adding many BSD features based on System v to the top
 The proposal to build Kos ended the most infamous phase of the war by major Unix players that year, and then the 1994 merger of UI and OSF

 Other allegations include ibm's breach of trade secrets, or the breach of contract by former clients of Santa Cruz, who have now switched to Lynix
 haalanki, novel ne unics strot par aadhaarit SCO samooh kaa copirit daawa vivaadit bataaya
 According to Nowell, SCO was effectively the promoter of Novell's exclusive sales, which also retained the inner copyright, the veto's authority over sco's future activities and 95% of licensing revenue

 haalanki isane multics or buros kaa netritv kiya, lekin yah unics hi tha jisane yah vichaar lokapriy kiya
 In comparison to many contemporary operating systems, Unix's file was much simpler, managing all types of files like simple byte arrays
 The file system includes hierarchical machine services and devices, providing a similar interface, but sometimes at the expense of the need for additional mechanisms such as flag bend to use features such as iostal and hard wear that simplify the model "stream of Bytes "
 Plan 9 extended this model of operational mechanisms and eliminated the need for additional arrangements

 Unix used the same language for interactive commands as for shell scripting
 When the shell and OS commands were "just another program", users could choose their shell
 New commands can be added without changing the shell

 The common denominator in the i / o system was the byte, unlike the "record-based" file system
 a focus on text to represent almost everything has made Unix Pipo particularly useful and encouraged the development of simple, common tools that can easily be combined into ad hoc more complex tasks
