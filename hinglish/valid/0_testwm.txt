 turki bhashaayen pantis se bhi adhik bhashaaon kaa ek bhashaa-parivaar he
 Turkish languages are spoken from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea to Siberia and western China
 kuch bhashavaigyanik inhen altaai bhashaa parivaar kii ek shakha maanate hai
 Around 16
5 to 180 million people in the world speak Turkish languages as their mother tongue, and if they can speak all the Turkish languages, then about 250 million people can speak them
 sab se adhik boli jane vaali turki bhashaa kaa naam bhi turki he, haalaanki kabhi-kabhi ise anatolvi bhi kaha jaataa he 
 Some features can be seen in Turkish languages - mongolia kii orphon ghati main sthit orphon shilaalekh kisi bhi turki bhashaa main mili sab se puraane lekh hai or inamen prayogit bhashaa ko puraani turki bhashaa kaha jaataa he
 These rocks were erected in the period between 732 and 735 CE in honor of the chiefs of two Gokturk clan named Kul Tigin and Bilge Qagaan
 turki bhashaaon par sabase pehla gaharaa adhyayan karakhan sultanate ke vaasi kashgarali mahmud ne apni 11veen shatabdi main likhi kitaab "divanue lugaatit tujerk" main puraa kiya
 It was the first comprehensive dictionary of Turkish dialects and was the first known map of the spread of Turkish speakers
 chhathi shatabdi ke baad turki-bhashi faujen puure madhya asia par haaavee ho gayi
 They were also captured in the northern areas of Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent
 dilli sultanate ke gulam vansh ke sabhi shaasha or mogul samrajya ke pratham shaasha babar turki maatrubhaashi the
 Baburnama, the historical narration written by Babar, is also written in the Chagat e language of the Turkish family
 is prabhaav se turki ke bahut se shabd farsi, hindi-urdu, roosi or hungarian bhashaa main samaa gaye
 The list of Turkish words in Hindi is very long and these words often differ from arabic-persian and look similar to the indigenous words of Hindi, such as servant, brave, chadar, spoon, scissors, wind, umbrella, porter and cannon
 dhyaan den ki is lekh main or turki bhashaaon main prayog hone vaale 'kh' varna kaa sahi uccharan 'kha' se zaraa bhinn hota he
 Similarly, the correct pronunciation of the letter 'G' is different from 'C'
 prithvi upree sataha par mote, madhyam or baarik carbonic tathaa acarbonic mishrit kanon ko mrudaa kehete hai
 The rock is usually found when the soil is removed from the top surface
 kabhi kabhi thodi gaharaai par hi chattan mil jaati he
 'soil Science' is a major branch of physical geography in which scientific study of soil formation, its characteristics and its distribution on the ground is done
 pruthvi kii upree sataha ke kanon ko hi soil kaha jaataa he Soil brought by the banks of rivers and by the flow of water, which is called 'cachar soil', does not get rock by digging
 vahaan neeche ke str main jal kaa strot miltaa he
 All soils originate from rock
 jahaan prakruti ne mitti main adhik her-pher nahin kiya or jalwaayu kaa prabhaav adhik nahin padaa, vahaan yah sambhav he ki ham neeche kii chattaanon se upar kii mitti kaa sambandh krambaddh rup se sthapit kar saken
 Although the top surface soil has a different look to the rock below, both have a chemical relationship and if the soil has not been brought from another site by natural action, ie, by water, or by blowing air
 , Then this relationship can be fully established
 chattan ke upar ek str aisa bhi paaya ja saktaa he jo chattan se hi bana he or abhi prakritik kriyaaon dwaara purnat: mitti ke rup main nahin aayaa he, sirf chattan ke mote-mote tukade ho gaye hai, jo na to mitti kahe ja sakate hai or na chattan
 The texture of soil is found in their upper surface
 isi str kii mitti main hamen neeche kii chattan ke rasinic or bhautik gunon kaa sanchay mil saktaa he
 If the rock is crystalline, it is likely 100 percent confirmed
 neeche kii chattan ke atyant nikatavarti, parshv bhaag main chattan ke samaan rasinic or bhautik gun praapt ho sakate hai
 As the distance increases upward, the outline of the rock will also change
 ant main ham vah mitti pate hai, jo krishi ke liye atyant anukool siddh hui he or jisapar aadi kaal se krishi hoti aa rahi he tathaa manushya fasal paidaa karata rahaa he
 Some of the soil is formed from the rocks of other places due to natural reasons
 aise sthanon main yah sambhaavna nahin he ki upar kii mitti kaa bhautik tathaa rasinic sambandh neeche ke sanchay se sthapit kiya jaay, par yah nishchit he ki mitti kii utpatti chattaanon se hui he
 Organic matter is also found in the soil of the fields, along with the minerals of rocks, by the decay of tree plants
 sookshmdarshi dwaara tathaa rasinic vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki chattaanon kii chhijan kriya prakruti main paae janevaale rasinic dravyon ke prabhaav se dhire-dhire hoti he
 The chemical components of the rocks change and the outline of the soil appears to be quite different
 yadi chattan kaa chhijna hi mitti ke banane main ek pradhan kriya hoti to ham aaj kheton kii mitti ko paudhon ke penpaane ke liye anukool nahin pate
 The soil cannot be compared to a finely rocked PC
 yadhyapi chattaanon ke khanij mitti ke upree bhaag main bahut paae jate hai or unke tukade bhi bade pariman main vartmaan rahete hai, phir bhi mitti main jeev-jantu kriyaayein hoti rahati hai, jo krishi ke liye mahatvapurn sabit hui hai
 Due to the effect of fauna and the substances related to them, such as decayed plant material and rotten fauna, small particles of rocks obtained in the bud state are reacted and the color of the soil changes
 yah rup chattaanon ke sirf kanon kaa nahin rahata, mitti kaa ek naveen pranali kii bhusha se susajjit ho jaati he
 If we examine a piece of soil with a microscope and then by examining the particles of these rocks with the same instrument, we will find the difference between the two
 yah antar un acarbonic padaarthon ke sammishran se hota he jo jeev-jantu or paudhon se praapt hote hai
 The action that helps in the formation of soil due to the conversion of rocks into small particles by natural action is called weathering
 yah kriya mahatvapurn he or iske kaaran hi ham prithvi par mitti ko krishi ke anukool pate hai
 In this activity, water, oxygen in the air, carbon dioxide, bacteria and other acidic chemical substances are very helpful
 yah maani hui baat he ki jis mitti par prakritik kriyaayein hoti he, jal kaa prapaat tathaa vaayu or suryakiran kaa sansarg hota rahata he, vah kuch varsho main aisa rup dhaaran kar leti he jisase uske neeche kii bhinn rup rang or gunwali mittiyon ke bahut se sanstar ho jate hai
 If we dig a pit 10 or 12 feet deep on the top surface of the soil and observe the soil surface, we will regularly find many different colored, composed soil from one level to another
 vaigyanikon ne iske teen hi pradhan str maane hai or ve kin-kin kaarnon se or kin-kin paristhitiyon main paae jate hai, iskaa bhi varnan kiya he
 The water passes through the top layer of soil and carries many chemical substances to the bottom layer and there, along with the soil, changes the color form of soil by many chemical reactions
 is tarah upar se dravya aakar neeche ke sanstar main jamaa ho jate hai
 One of them is the upper bed, from which the matter is dissolved by water and goes downward, or deposited in the lower level by precipitation
 is upree sanstar ko ham sanstar kehete hai
 The second is the stratum, in which matter comes and accumulates by the action described above, it is called strata
 teesraa sanstar uske neeche he, jisamen upar kii mitti banati he, ise sanstar kehete he
 In other words, this bed is also called ancestral bed
 yah naam isaliye sarthak he ki isi sanstar se upar vaali mitti kii utpati hui he
 The rock and large debris made of it are found in this bed
 har ek sanstar main bhinn-bhinn sanstar sammilit rahete hai
 It is a very difficult problem to show the ordered relation of the strata
 is samasya ko pehle rus ke vaigyanikon ne hal kiya tha
 The most difficult problem appears when some portion of the top layer of soil is cut by erosion
 kabhi-kabhi to sampurna sanstar kaa kataav ho jaataa he or sanstar rah jaataa he
 The science in which research is conducted on the internal relationship of these beds is called soil science
 is vigyaan se mitti ke vargeekaran main adhik sahaayta milti he
 It is modern science and its progress is progressing

 mitti ke bhautik gun mitti kii sanrachana, jalwaayu mitti main sthit ooshmaa evam khanij padaartho par nirbhar hai
 Clay particles are of different size types, some are big, some are small and some are very subtle
 bade aakaar ke kan chote-chote pattharon ke tukade hote hai
 As natural activity takes place on them, the larger pieces become smaller and eventually become the size of sand, silt, clay or loam soil
 mitti ke bade aakaar ke kan adhikansh balui mitti main paae jate hai or chote aakaar ke kan matiyaar mitti main milte hai
 By mixing of these two size particles, different types of soils are formed and they also have different physical properties
 mitti main sthit bhautik gunon kaa krishi vigyaan se atyant gaharaa sambandh he
 Some physical properties of soil, such as relative gravity, particle structure, particle size, soil solubility and cohesion, color, weight, particle size, particle size, etc
 are of importance, the relative gravity of soil is of two types, one virtual and the other absolute
 abhaasi aapekshik gurutv mitti ke bhitari bhaag main jal tathaa vaayu ke samavesh se praapt hota he, arthath yah mitti ke bhitari sthit khanij se mishrit jal or vaayu kaa gurutv he
 Therefore the amount of this gravity is less than absolute relative gravity

 In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin gave the scientific theory of evolution through natural selection
 unhone ise apni kitaab jeevajati kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 The process of evolution by natural selection can be proved by the following observations: 1) more offspring are born than they can possibly survive, 2) the population has a variety of morphological, physical, and behavioral traits, 3) Different traits provide different chances of post-life and reproduction, and 4) traits are given from one generation to the next
 is prakaar, peedi dar peedi aabaadi un shakson kii santanon dwaara pratisthapit ho jaati he jo us baiophisical parivesh ke behatar anukulit hon
 The process of natural selection creates and retains traits with this virtual purpose that fit its functional role

 Other non-adaptive causes of micro-sequence evolution are mutation and genetic drift

 In contrast to these physical ideas, Aristotelianism regarded all natural things as the real forms of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms
 yah prakruti kii ek madhyayugin doorsanchaar kii samaj kaa hissaa tha jisamen sabhi vastuon kaa ek divya brahmadia kram main khilne ke liye ek mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real-type creatures always conform to each other for true spiritual forms, and especially new types

 In the 17th century, the new method of modern science rejected the Aristotlean view

 In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertus wrote about the natural modifications that occur during breeding and accumulated over many generations to produce new species
 georges-louis leclerrk, comate di bamphone ne suzav diya ki prajatiyaan alag-alag jeevon main bighad sakati hai, or irasmus darwin ne prastaav kiya tha ki sabhi garm rakt vaale jaanavar ek hi sookshmjeev se utar sakate the
 The first fully developed development plan was jean-baptiste Lemarck's "transformation" theory of 1809, in which healthy generations consistently created simpler forms of life that developed more complexity with a progressive tendency inherent in parallel lineages, and localized At the level, these lineages can be adapted to the environment due to changes in their use or absence in the parents

 In particular, George Cuvre asserted that species are unrelated and determined, their similarities reflect divine design for functional needs
 Meanwhile, William Paly developed Red's ideas into natural theology or the god of existence and existence of Christians

 Partially influenced by an essay on the theory of population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin stated that population growth can lead to a "struggle for survival" in which favorable variation prevails as others die

 It can explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common lineage through the work of natural laws in the same way for all types of organisms

 Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide convincing evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry

 The mechanisms of reproductive heredity and the origin of new traits remained a mystery
 is disha main, darwin ne pengenesis ke apana asthaayee siddhant viksit kiya
 In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that the elements were inherited in a predictable manner through independent classification and separation elements
 mandaal ke viraasat ke kanoonon ne antat darwin ke sabase adhik pengensis siddhant kii purti kii
 August Weismann has significant differences between germ cells that give rise to gametes and somatic cells of the body, showing that heredity only passes through the germ line

 De Wills was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, assuming that Mendelian traits correspond to the transfer of genetic changes at the germline

 In 1973, the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobhansky wrote that "nothing in biology leaves the light of evolution", because it brought to light the earlier relationship to the contradictory facts of those natural relations, a knowledge of which Explains in clear explanatory body and many observational facts about life on this planet have been speculated

 Natural selection within a population for a trait, which can vary on a variety of values such as elevation, can be classified into three different types
 The first is directional selection, which over time is associated with a particular trait
 The average value changes — for example, organisms gradually become higher
 duusare, vighatnkaaree chayan atyadhik gun mulyon ke liye chayan hota he or aksar do alag-alag mulyon main sabase aam ho jaataa he, ausat mulya ke khilaaf chayan ke saath
 This will happen when either miniature or high organisms have an advantage, but not of medium height
 Finally, stabilizing selection involves choosing between extreme characteristics on either side, which is the average value and low diversity
 Reduces the variance around

 The test to detect hepatitis b virus infection, called an assay, involves a serum or blood test that identifies either the viral antigen or the antibodies produced by the host
 in parakhon kii vyakhya jatil he
 Hepatitis b surface antigen is frequently used for the presence of this infection
 yah pehla pahachaane jane laayak viral antigen he jo sankraman ke dauraan prakat hota he
 However, at the beginning of an infection, this antigen may not be present and subsequently remain undetected as it is cleared by the host
 sankramak virian main viral jinom ko sanlagn karte hue ek bhitari "kor kan" bhi hota he
 The isahedral core particle is composed of 180 or 240 proteins per core, alternatively known as the hepatitis b core antigen hbcag
 isi 'windo' ke dauraan jisamen mejabaan sankramit rahete hai lekin safaltaapurvak vaayas ko saaf karte hai, hepatitis bi kor antigen ke liye igm antibody rog ke ekmaatr serological pramaan ho sakate hai
 Soon after hbeag appears another antigen called hepatitis b e will appear
 Traditionally, the presence of hbeag in the serum of the host is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and increases the efficacy; However, variants of hepatitis b virus do not produce 'E' antigen, so this rule is not always true
 sankraman ke prakritik course ke dauraan, hbeag ko saaf kiya ja saktaa he or 'i' antigen ke antibody turant baad paidaa hote hai
 This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication
 agar mejabaan sankraman ko saaf karne main sakasham he, to aakhirkaar hbsag anapahchananeey ho jayega or iske baad hepatitis bi sataha ke igg antibody or kor antigen paidaa honge
 hbsag ko hataane or anti-hbs ke prakat hone ke bich ke samay ko windo avadhi kaha jaataa he

 Unlike hepatitis A, hepatitis b does not usually spread through food and water
 Instead, it is transmitted through the transmission of body fluids, so it is prevented by avoiding this type of transmission: unprotected sexual contact, transfusions, reuse of contaminated needles and syringes and during childbirth
 Vertical transmission
 Infants may be vaccinated at birth
