 Physics of solid state is also known as solid state theory
 yah bhautikee kii vah shakha he jisamen thos kii sanrachana or uske bhautik gunon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 This condensed phase is the largest branch of physics
 thos avasthaa bhautikee main is baat par vichaar kiya jaataa he ki thoson ke vahya gun unke parmaanu-stareey gunon se kis prakaar sambandhit hai
 Thus solid state physics forms the theoretical basis of material science

 As our knowledge about concrete condition is increasing, attention to the last mentioned qualities is becoming more and more attractive
 dravya teen vibhinn avasthaaon main paaya jaataa he - thos, drav tathaa gas
 The density is very low in the gas state and the compression strength is very high
 iske vipareet thos tathaa drav kaa ghanatv apekshaakrit adhik hota he, kintu sampeden atyant kam
 The code of the unit volume of a gas at ordinary pressure and temperature is approximately millennium of the code of a solid or liquid with the same volume
 apni adhik sampeden samarthy ke kaaran hi gaisen jis baratan main rakhi jaati hai use ve purnataya bhar detii hai
 The volume of a solid changes little by increasing the pressure and its size is also fixed
 thoson main kartanvikar ho saktaa he, jab ki gas yaa drav main yah gun upasthit nahin hota
 On the basis of the difference in physical properties of solids and gases, it can be explained that the distance between the atoms of a gas is much greater than the distance between the atoms of a solid or a liquid
 chunki gas ke ikai aaytan main parmaanuon kii sankhya apekshaakrit kam hoti he, at: uskaa ghanatv bhi thodaa hi hota he
 Then the atomic forces also decrease due to the greater distance between the atoms
 at: inamen ant:parmanviya duriyon ko saralata se badla ja saktaa he
 In the interpretation of the gaseous state, the intrinsic atomic forces can be considered negligible, but this cannot be done in the evolution of solid and fluid theories
 is dasha main ant:parmanviya balon kaa spasht rup se vichaar karnaa hoga, kyonki inamen parmaanu ek duusare ke nikat hai or inke bich laganevaale bal shaktishaalee hai
 There are many types of atomic forces, so the properties of solids are more different than those of gas
 udhaaharan ke liye, paara tathaa argon gasiy avasthaa main bahut samaan gun pradarshit karte hai, jabaki thos or drav dasha main inke gunon main yathesht antar paaya jaataa he
 Solids are divided into two categories, Manibhiya and Amanibhiya
 manibhiya thoson ke andar parmaanuon kii vyavastha main unche darje kii krambaddhata pai jaati he
 Atoms in atomic solids are not arranged in a certain order
 manibhiya thos paanch spasht shakhaon main vibhajit kiye gaye hai : 1
 Metals and alloys, 2
 lavan, 3
 Connective Crystals, 4
 anu manibh tathaa 5
 Semiconductors
 dhaatu or mishradhaatuon main vidyucchalakata tathaa dhatvik chamak pai jaati he
 In these, the property of electronegativity arises due to the variance of free electrons
 lavan main aaweshit aayan hote hai
 Connective crystals are hard materials, such as diamond and silicon carbide
 inkaa galnaank unchaa hota he tathaa inkaa nirmaan praarambhik sanyoji rasayanashastra ke niyamon ke anusaar hota he
 Molecular crystals are solids in which the forces holding permanent molecules are very small
 arthchaalak, jaise zinc oxide yaa copper oxide, aise thos hote hai, jinamein vicharan karanevaale electranon dwaara utpann honevaali vidyucchalakata ksheen maatra main hi pai jaati he
 Amanibh solids exhibit the same properties as those found in molecular and connective crystals
 inaki rachana bade aakaar ke anuon dwaara hoti he, jinke bich ke badhanabal ksheen hote hai tathaa sanyoji bandhan prabal
 Only solid solids whose atoms inside are arranged in three independent directions according to the three-dimensional mesh structure are considered for the study of the solid state

 The polymer is made up of parallel groups of large-sized molecules, whose composition may also resemble those of crystals in some cases
 saamanyat: pratibal padane par thos dridhtaa kaa gun pradarshit karte hai
 The corresponding pathology is very reversible
 phir bhi sthir bhaar daalane par kuch na kuch shyaneey pravaah utpann ho hi jaataa he
 The development of the study of solid state theory can be divided into four stages: 1
 sthool gun, visheshtya sthool samamiti ; 2
 Lattice theory and lattice model; 3
 paripurna manibhon ke gunon kaa parmaanu siddhant dwaara pratipaadan tathaa 4
 Development of the principle of imperfection of manibhas
 punarjagran kaal se lekar, jabaki is vishay ke adhyayan kaa prarambh hua tha, pichhali shatabdi ke ant tak logon kaa dhyaan pratham charan par vishesh rup se kendrit rahaa tha
 Interest in lattice theory was initially limited to abstract or theoretical aspects only
 isane vyaavhaarik rup tab dhaaran kiya, jab pratham mahayuddh ke thik purv is baat kii khoj kii ja chuki thi ki manibhon kii jaaleey sanrachana se eks kirnon kaa vivartan ek adwitiya dhang se hota he
 The atomic theory was first applied at the end of the last century for the primary determination of the properties of gemstones
 par is paddati ne san 1925 or 1928 ke bich, jab aadhunik kwantum yantriki evam tarang yantriki kaa samuchit vikaas ho chukaa tha, purnataa praapt kii
 The systematic study of the imperfection of gemstones began around 1925
 yah apane charam vikaas par san 1945 ke baad pahunchaa
 The goal of solid state theory is to represent various properties of solids based on parametric and nuclear principles
 ab tak vistaar se adhyayan kiye gaye vishay nimnlikhit hai : pratyaasthi tathaa sughaty aacharan, sansanjan tathaa sansanjan urjaayen, electrovneey parivahan ; yneey parivahan ; vishisht ooshmaa; chumbakeey gun; vidyutpaarak gun; phero vaidyut gun; prakaashiya gun tathaa nabhikeey or electroneey anuwaad
 The above mentioned areas come under the purview of fundamental scientific research done under the theory of solid state
 in kshetron ke katipay brihat ansh vyaavhaarik yaa takneekee kaarnon se vishesh mahatv praapt kar sake hai
 The division of technical areas is mainly as follows: metallurgy; Semiconductor; Clay craft, which is based on the properties of salts and valence compounds; Polymer Chemistry and Magnetism
 thosiya avasthaa ke mesaron ke vishay ne, jo ek vishesh prakaar ke electroneey anunaad ko pradarshit karanevaale padaarthon se sambandhit he, aadhunik technology main pramukh sthaan praapt kar liya he
 The variation of properties of different solids is due to the difference in forces between their constituent atoms and the variation of the order of atoms
 parmaanu siddhant ke anusaar parmaanu jab dur-dur rahete hai to ve ek duusare ko aakarshith karte hai or jab ve ek duusare ke atyant nikat rahete hai to ve ek duusare ko pratikarshith karte hai
 The energy of reaction between different atoms first decreases, then it assumes the minimum value and then it increases by accident
 nunatam maan us vakt hota he jab aakarshan or pratikarshan ke bal ek duusare ke baraabar ho jate hai
 The position of atoms for minimum energy depends on which chemical category these atoms belong to
 nunatam paraspar kriya ke pariman se ant:parmanviya bandhan kii prabalata kii naap gyaat hoti he
 Find out the mechanism of atomic delivery within the solid with the help of X-rays
 manibh thoson par kiye gaye prayogon ke anusaar trivimeetiya jaaleey sanrachana ke prayek falak par parmaanuon kaa samaan vitaran hota he
 The regular ordering of atoms inside a non-soluble solid is found to be of lower order

 In contrast, metals with high electronegativity coincide with each other according to the general laws of valency chemistry
 udhaaharan ke liye tanba bina apni jaaleey sanrachana main antar utpann kiye hue 30 pratishat tak jasta apane main vilay kar saktaa he
 These metals form compounds that bear no resemblance to the properties of the constituent ingredients
 udhaaharan ke liye, tanba or jasta se ve yogic banate hai jinke sutara tay tathaa ta5 ya8 hai
 Compounds of metallic combinations can be of two types: substituted alloys and interstitial alloys
 inke sangyojan ke niyamon kaa adhyayan hum rothare tathaa haig ne kiya
 In substituted alloys, the proportion of constituent metals inside the solution changes as the atoms of one metal are replaced by atoms of another metal
 yah paaya gaya he ki in yogicon main donon dhaatuon ke parmaanuon ke vyas main 15 pratishat se adhik kaa antar nahin hota
 An example of this is the different varieties of brass obtained by mixing zinc in different proportions
 antaraleey mishradhaatuon main ek dhaatu ke parmaanu itane chote hote hai ki ve duusari dhaatu ke parmaanu kii jagah par feet baith saken
 Therefore, some part of the metal structure of these metals is formed by the atom of another metal
 sanyog karanevaali dhaatuen yadi vidyudvahak shrenee main ek duusare ke nikat sthit hon or yadi chote akaarawale parmaanu kaa vyas duusari dhaatu ke parmaanu ke vyas ke 0
59 gune se kam ho, tab ye sahaj hi antaraleey mishradhatuen bana leti hai
 Alloys formed by the merging of carbon into iron are examples of this caste

 Here there is free energy, there is energy of that body, there is heat and there is entropy
 paramashunya taap par 
 Therefore, a permanent state will occur only when there is a minimum
 sankhyikeey yantriki ke anusaar ek aisi raashi he jo kaa nirantar vruddhi karanevaala ekadisht falan he
 When the temperature of a solid increases beyond zero then the possibility of change in the religion of equilibrium arises
 thoson main nimna taap par manibh rup dhaaran karne kii pravriti pai jaati he
 When the temperature rises, the effect of the post can take one of the following forms: 1
 samya sthitiyon ke chaturdik parmaanu dolan karne lag jate hai
 This violation of order is universally expressed in all solids
 2
 jaaleey sanrachana main aisa parivartan aa saktaa he ki parmaanuon kii adhik swatantraaa praapt ho jaae
 This change is called non-uniform change
 gandhak main kai apararupi parivartan hote hai
 3
 Interchange of pairs of atoms in the lattice structure can result in interference
 mishradhaatuon main praaia: yah baat pai jaati he
 4
 In molecular crystals and salts, such as ammonium chloride, the lattice structure can be interfered with by specific molecules or radicals
 5

 Experiments have confirmed that diffusion and ion conductivity are the result of similar changes
 6
 dravan tathaa urdhvapathan jaaleey vyavastha ke charam vyatikram ke falswaroop ghatit hote hai
 7
 Free electrons are present in metals

 Any of these chaos can lead to absorption of thermal energy
 avashoshit urja hi vishisht ooshmaa pradaan karti he, jisase taap main vruddhi hoti he yaa phir vah gupt ooshmaa kaa rup dhaaran kar leti he
 Solids found in nature are not completely firm
 bal ke lagane par inamen vikruti utpann ho jaati he
 If the body takes its full form after removing the force, then it is called the elastic solid
 iske pratikul bal hataa lene par yadi vah apni purv akruti dhaaran na kar sake to ise plastic kahenge
 Steel and rubber are examples of solids residing within a long boundary, and putty exhibits plastic properties almost from the earliest stage
 prati ikai lambaai main utpann honevaali vikruti ko tanaav vikruti kehete hai, tathaa prati ikai lambaai main utpann honevaale sampeden ko sampidya vikruti kehete hai
 The value of the force per unit area in the body is called stress
 yadi ek ytaakar nipind a ba sa da kaa falak ba sa kas diya jaae or yadi iskaa virupan a" ba" sa" da" akruti main kar diya jaae to is virupan ko kartan kehete hai
 Each atom of a solid remains in equilibrium state between attraction and repulsion forces
 bal aropit kiye jane par ye parmaanu naveen sthitiyaan praapt kar lete hai, tab ham kehete hai ki thos vikrut ho gaya
 The extent of elasticity depends on the nature of the stress to be charged, the material receiving the deformation and its prior history
 taral sthitik daab se bahut adhik vikruti utpann kii ja sakati he
 Invertebrate solids such as glass become brittle at low temperatures, but many geminal solids, such as metals, exhibit abundant tensile near extreme zero temperatures
 anek thoson ke plastic pravaah kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Consequently the following important rules have been obtained: 1
 khisakanevaale dharaatal kii sidh main manibh ke vibhinn bhaagon ke aapekshik sthanantaran ke kaaran plastic vikruti utpann hoti he
 2
 The appropriate condition for transfer to the ground of the sliding surface is determined by the result of the shearing stress that is dissolved in that plane
 saamanyat: sthanantaran us samay hoga jab kartan pratibal ek nishchit kranthik kartan pratibal ke maan se adhik ho jayega
 The value of critical shearing stress also increases with the decrease of plastic deformation
 is ghatana kii kaaryakthorikaran kehete hai
 3
 There is a certain temperature above which the effect of work hardening disappears when the temperature rises
 is taap ko punarmridukaran taap kehete hai
 The value of the critical shearing stress depends on the temperature up to below the rehydration temperature
 dhaatuon kii ucch tanyata kaa pradurbhaav unki apdravyata ke kaaran hota he
 After 1930, when quantum mechanics was used to determine the behavior of the valence electrons, there was a special progress in the theory of solid state at the same time
 thos sambandhi anusandhan main kwantum yantriki kaa prayukt kiya janaa bahut kuch vaisaa hi he jaisaa mapank pranali ke liye
 When the wavelength of the electronic state is to be determined, the coordinates of the nucleus are considered as parameters

 Among these, the following are particularly notable: sansrujan thos kii sansanjan urja ko is prakaar vyakt kar sakate hai ki yah vah urja he jo thos sataha se kisi electron kii anant tak le jane main vyay hogi, arthath urvapathan kii ooshmaa ke baraabar
 If the energy of the electron is known, then one can get the value of fusion energy
 yah vidhi vibhinn thoson kii aapekshik sansanjan urja kaa maan gyaat karne ke liye bahutayat se kaam main laai jaati he
 Electronegativity The conduction of electricity in a solid is due to the presence of free electrons, or movable ions
 kwantum yantriki kii sabase badi safalataa is baat main he ki dhaatuon or ardhchalkon main electroneey chaalakata kii prakruti iske dwaara thik-thik samajhi ja saki he, kintu nimna taap par pradarshit honevaali atichaalakata ke gun kii vyakhya abhi tak kwantum yantriki ke aadhaar par nahin kii ja saki he
 It is for this reason that perfect solutions to waveform have not yet been possible

 naa aana is desh lado ke anukram lado - virpur kii mardaani mahilaon kii taskari or yon shoshan jaise gambhir vishyon se sambandhit tha
 Naa Aana, one of the successful small screen serials, was the second season of this Desh Lado Lado 2 / Lado - Virpur Ki Mardaani
 aath saal baad yah sho apane duusare sizan ke saath waapas lautaa tha
 While the show in the first season was based on female feticide, this time the story raised serious issues like the purchase and exploitation of women
 kahani kii baat karen to virpur main abhi bhi purushavaadi soch haaavee thi
 Balwant Singh ruled there, who kidnapped and sold girls
 virpur main koi bhi ladki surakshit nahin thi
 Located in the areas of Haryana, the show returned on 6 November 2017 and so did the hard and stiff Ammaji, which softened over time
 sho 70 varshiya buudhe aadmi ke saath shuru hua tha jo balavant singh kii haveli main pravesh karata he, jo ek yuva dulhan ke badale paise se bharaa bag dene aata he
 Balwant kidnapped young girls and sold them for huge profits
 is sho ne pehle sijan kii kahani kii samaapti ke baad ek lip liya tha or ammaji ke virpur main kai chijen badali thim, jise ab balavant singh dwaara shasit kiya jaataa tha, jiskaa aatank gaanv main failaa hua tha
 While na anna was rampant with female feticide and misogyny in this country Lado, however, the situation in Veerpur in Lado 2 worsened, as there were hardly any girls in the village who were not tortured, causing young girls There was an increase in kidnapping and crime against women
 ammaji, jo ab apni do potiyo ke saath dilli chali gai thim unhen virpur se dur rakhana chaahati thim sirf isiilie kyonki virpur yuva ladakiyon ke liye surakshit nahin tha
 Avika Gore, who played the character of Ammaji's elder granddaughter Anushka, was an independent and fearless person
 jabaki anoushka nidar thim or sahi ke liye ladane ke liye tatpar rahati thim, unki choti bahan jahnavi ek gharelu ladki thim or anoushka ke bilkul vipareet thim
 Born in Delhi, Anushka got the shock of her life when her sister Jahnavi was kidnapped in Veerpur, which was also the village of her ancestors
 meghna malik, jinhone ammaji kii bhoomika ko naa aana is desh lado se doharaaya tha, unke doshahin abhinay se yah sho hit jaataa tha
 Avika, who we saw in Balika Vadhu and Sasural Simar Ka, played a strong character in the show
 anoushka ke rup main hamane unhe ek nae avatar main dekha or utsahit hue
 The situation in Veerapur was somewhat reminiscent of the 2003 film Matrubhoomi, which depicted the future of female feticide over the years
 sho praasangik muddon se sambandhit tha, kyonki maanav taskari bad rahi he or haryana or rajasthan rajyon main ling asantulan ne in kshetron main kai aapraadhik gatividhiyon ko janm diya he
 The issues raised in the serial's story and the horrors associated with it were seen in many films and crime based shows
 is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah mudda samayik he
 In many states the difference in the number of boys and girls has increased the incidence of crime against girls, so it is good to highlight such issues
 sho ke shuruaati episod main kahani ko khinchaa nahin gaya tha, balki kuch episods ke baad hi sho apni mul kahani par aa gaya tha
 Something happened in every episode, so that the show was able to engage the audience
 abhinay kii baat karen to ek baar phir meghna malik apane kirdaar se prabhavit karne main kaamayaab rahi thim, haalanki is baar sho main unki bhoomika bhakshak kii nahin, balki rakshak kii thi
 Seeing him act this time was no less than a treat
 avika kaa prakhar andaaz khaas tha
 He did justice once again with his talent
 palak jain bhi apni bhoomika se niraash nahin karti thim
 Rituraj was able to awaken hatred in the role of Balwant Singh
 baaqi ke kirdaar apane abhinay se kahani ko bakubi aage le ja chuke the
 The serial was on the backdrops of Haryana, Delhi and Chandigarh
 is baat ko kalakaaron ne samvaad adaayagi main bakubi aatmsaar kiya tha
 This thing was also taken care of in the look of the show

 lekin baad main sanjay kii yaaddaasht chali jaati he
 Along with this loot, he has forgotten all about Pandit and Idris too
 vah ye bhi bhul jaataa he ki lut ke paise usne kahaan rakhe hai

 NAL submitted a feasibility study report to the Research Council in November 1990 and started looking for an industrial partner
 yah pariyojna 1991 main rus ke saath sahyog ke rup main shuru hui
 But the Russians soon withdrew from the project due to the financial crisis

 us nirvaat nalika ko eks kiran nalika yaa 'eksre tub' kehete hai jo eks kiran utpann karti he
 The X-ray tubes evolved from the Crookes tube from which the firstmexare was discovered

 Due to the voltage, the electron would get energy e × v, where = the charge of the electron, and the voltage
 yadi itani kul urja dhanagar ke anuon main sthanantarit ho jaae tathaa is urja kaa eksre main parivartan ho, to utsarjit eksre kii aavruti nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara praapt hogi : e × v = constant x frequency of the plank

 The value of Planck's constant is 6
62 × 10–27 erg-seconds
 vidyucchumbakeey tarangon ke liye aavriti tathaa tarangadairghy main nimnlikhit sambandh hota he: Wavelength × frequency = velocity of electronegativity = 2

 Per second yadi vibhav volt main gyaat ho, to utpaadit eksre kaa tarangadairghy angastram ekakon main nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara saralata se nikaala ja saktaa he: Wavelength = 12403 / volt
 
 
 sameekaran ke anusaar eksre kaa jo tarangadairghy praapt hota he vah keval is anumaan par aadhaarit he ki runagra se dhanagar tak pahunchne main electron ko praapt urja kaa sampurna bhaag vidyucchumbakeey tarangon main parivartit hokar sameekaran ke anusaar vikiran kaa ek hi kwantum detaa he
 But this is not true for all electrons
 vidyucchumbakeey vikiran utpann hone ke purv electron kii urja ke anshat: athwa sampoornat: nasht hone kii bahut adhik sambhaavna rahati he
 There are many reasons for this
 jis dhaatu kaa dhanagar ho us dhaatu ke parmaanuon se pratham aghat hone par electron us dhanagar ke tal ke bheetar jate hai
 The electrons from these atoms have resistance in motion, as those atoms are also penetrated by other electrons
 prayek dhaatu main dhatviya electron hote hai jinke kaaran dhaatuen vidyucchalak hoti hai
 At the time of entering the positive, electrons coming from the negative and internal electrons of the positive have many collisions and the energy of external electrons in each collision decreases
 at: ant main jab bahya electranon se vidyucchumbakeey tarangen utpann hoti hai tab in electranon kii urja ek samaan nahin hoti
 The potential energy will be greater than the difference, but the electrons of this maximum energy - that is, those which have not had a single impact are very small; Most electrons have less energy than this
 isliye utpaadit eksre ekvarn nahin hota; hamen eksre kaa avichhinn varnakram miltaa he
 The spectrum of white light is similar to that of X-ray; Therefore, the spectrum of X-ray is also called 'white radiation'
 rantjan ne jis prakaar ke upkarnon kii sahaayta se eksre kaa aavishkaar kiya tha prarambh ke katipay varsho tak usee prakaar ke upkaran upyog main laae jate the
 There was a slight improvement in these and scientists like Shearer, Heading, Zigbahra, etc
, used such x-ray tubes, which can be easily replaced, but a special flaw in all these air-immersion tubes was that they had electric current and voltage
 Changes could not be made freely
 yah dosha kulij kii eksre nalika main dur kar diya gaya
 In 1913 Coolidge produced X-rays by producing electrons on various elements which is known as 'coolidge tube'
 kulij ne electron praapt karne ke liye vaayu main vidyudvisarjan ke badale ushmiya yanon kaa upyog kiya
 The current is heated by the flow of current in the metal filaments and by increasing the current, it starts emitting light)
 is taptatantu se prakaash ke saath-saath electron bhi nikalate hai or yadi nirvaat main tapt tantu ke sameep dhaatu kii ek pattee rakhkar usko dhan vidyudvibhav diya jaae to dharamapi main vidyudhara dikhaai degi
 But to obtain electrons in this manner, a very high vacuum is required
 kulij ne kaanch kaa ek vishaal balb lekar uske centre main ucch galnankwali dhaatu kaa ek tukdaa rakhaa or uske abhimukh tungsten tantu ke sanrpil ke paryaapt chakra sthapit karke sampurna balb ko purnat: nirvaat kiya
 If enough electric current flows in this spiral of the fiber, then the fiber becomes heated and electrons are obtained from it
 in electranon ko vibhav badhaakar uchit urja di ja sakati he
 Due to the very high vacuum, the atoms of air do not have a collision, so electrons collide with the metal with full energy and an x-ray is produced
 kulij kii eksre nalika kii mukhya suvidha yah he ki utpaadit eksre kii tivrata tathaa kathorta main icchaanusaar parivartan kiya ja saktaa he
 If more electric current flows in the fiber by keeping the voltage constant, the number of electrons also increases according to Richardson's equation due to the heat of the fiber, so if the voltage is increased by keeping it constant, the minimum wavelength will decrease according to the equation and The stiffness of the generated x-rays will be greater
 is kulij nalika par aadhaarit, kintu aavashyak parivartanon se yukt anek prakaar kii eksre nalikaaon main ek apchaayi parinamitra se aavashyak prayavarti dhara pahunchaai jaati hai or ek ucchayi parinamitra se aavashyak prayavarti ucch vibhav utpann kiya jaataa he
 The Coolidge tube is self-absorbing
 eksre nalika main electranon main jo urja hoti he uske do pratishat se kuch kam bhaag kaa hi eksre main parivartan hota he or shesh 98 pratishat se kuch adhik bhaag ushma utpann karne main vyay hota he
 The temperature of the target, that is, a piece of metal that holds numerous electrons in the short term, becomes so high that it is likely to thaw
 lakshya ko thanda rakhane ke liye pani ke nirantar pravaah kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 In this way, removing the heat generated in the target is equal, there is no difficulty in taking work for more time than the x-ray tube
 eksre kaa adhyayan bhautikee kii drushti se atyant mahatvapurn to tha hi, dhire-dhire eksre kaa upyog, jaisaa upar bataaya gaya he, ayurvigyaan or udyog main bhi hone laga
 For all these tasks, the need for more rapid and rigid x-ray production increased
 is samasya ko hal karne ke liye eksre ke kshetra main kaary karanevaale anek vaigyanikon ne bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii nalikaay tathaa upkarnon kii upgna kii
 To increase the intensity the number of electrons must increase
 tantu main vidyuddhara badhaane se electranon kii sankhya avashya badhati hai, kintu tantu kaa taap adhik badhane se uski dhaatu kaa vaashpan hota he or uske ksheen hokar tuutane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Also, the heat generated by the electrons in the target increases, thus increasing the probability of the target melting
 in donon kathinaaiyon ko dur karne ke liye bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke praytn hue or unamem se katipay safal bhi rahe
 Oxide-coated fibers can provide more electron current at lower temperatures; Then, a favorable current can be obtained by taking a fiber of sufficient length
 saadhaarant: eksre nalikaaon main 10 se 150 miliempiar vidyuddhara kaa upyog hota he; vartmaan kaal main uchit tantuon se tathaa upsadhano se 1 anpiar athwa usase adhik electron dhara saralata se praapt ho sakati he
 To reduce the intense heat generated in the target by this rapid electron current, manufacturers of x-ray equipment such as Philips, General Electric, Matchlet, etc
 have held rotating circles in place of the stationary target
 ghurnan se electranon ke sanghaat ek hi sthaan par nahin hote or jis sthaan par ushma utpann hui he uske pun: sanghatasthaan par aane ke purv vikiran dwaara ushma kaa vyay ho jaataa he
 The intensity of the x-ray from the rotated target's x-ray tubes is many times greater than the intensity of the x-ray generated from the stationary target , that is, it saves a lot of time in taking photos
 eksre kii tivrata tathaa kathorta badhaane kaa doosraa bhi ek upaay he
 Increasing the electrical current of the tube also increases both intensity and hardness
 sameekaran ke anusaar vibhav badhaane se nunatam tarangadairghy ghatata jaataa he or vibhav paryaapt badhaane se gamma kirnon ke sadrush tarangadairghy vaale eksre kaa utpaadan prayogshaalaon main ho saktaa he
 Increasing the voltage also increases the intensity of the x-ray; The intensity is proportional to the cube of the voltage
 yadhyapi saadhaaran ucch vibhav ke parinamitra uplabdh the tathaapi eksre utpaadan ke liye paryaapt ucch vibhav praapt karne main anek kathinaaiyaan thim
 Manufacturers of General Electric, Matchlet, etc
 After many research, after one crore research, up to 10 million volts have been manufactured by the department for X-ray generating equipment
 isse bhi adhik pragati ilinoy ke praadhyaapak first ne betatrin kaa upyog karke kii he
 X-rays can be produced with potentials up to 400 million volts from betatron
 pranchad vibhav se utpann ye eksre atyant teevr tathaa praveshshil hote hai
 Other means are also used to generate high-intensity X-rays, among which Ullol-generator is particularly notable

 Controlled bursts of extremely high emission currents are produced by immersion of the Ullol generator
 yahan electranon kaa utpaadan ushn vidyudagr se nahin hota, apitu sheet vidyudagr se teevr vidyut kshetra ke kaaran electranon kaa utsarjan hota he

 His Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is itself the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most literary mechanics
 is kaary main, newton ne saarvatrik gurutv or gati ke teen niyamon kaa varnan kiya jisane agali teen shatabdiyon ke liye bhautik brahmad ke vaigyanik drushtikon par apana varchasv sthapit kar liya
 Newton demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are controlled by a set of natural laws, to show that he established a continuum between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, thus Overcome past doubts about sun centrality and the modernization of the scientific revolution
 yantriki main, newton ne samveg tathaa koniya samveg donon ke sangrakshan ke siddhanton ko sthapit kiya
 In optics, he created the first practical reflective telescope and developed the theory of color on the basis that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that make up the visible spectrum
 unhone shitalan kaa niyam diya or dhwani kii gati kaa adhyayan kiya
 In mathematics, Newton credits Gottfried Leibniz with the development of the differential and integral calculus
 unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa bhi pradarshan kiya or ek falan ke shunyon ke sanniktan ke liye tathakthith "newton kii vidhi" kaa vikaas kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa ke adhyayan main yogadan diya
 Newton's position among scientists is at the very top, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists at the Royal Society of Britain, which asked whether the impact on the history of science is more profound, Newton's or Albert Einstein's Of is surveykshan main newton ko adhik prabhavi paaya gaya
 
 Newton was also highly religious, although he was an unorthodox Christian, writing more on biblical hermeneutics than the natural sciences for which he is remembered today

 He considered light to be made up of very fine particles, whereas ordinary matter is made up of large particles and he said that a Through the type of chemical conversion "gross bodies and light cannot transform into each other, xxrep 7 
 and bodies from particles of light Can't get the most of their activity, who enters their organization? " Newton created a prototype form of a frictionless electrostatic generator, using a glass globe
