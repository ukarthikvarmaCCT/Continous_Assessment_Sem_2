 unhone yah bhi spasht rup se kaha he ki shruti or smriti main matbhed hone par shruti maanya hoti he or in donon ko anya do sroton se shreshth mana jaataa he
 Manusmriti or Manusamhita is considered to be their legal status

 It became part of independent India on 15 August 1947 leaving the British
 
 The province consisted of the districts of Ajmer and Merwar, politically forming an enclave from the rest of British India among the many princely states of Rajputana
 in rajyon ke vipareet, jo sthaneey raajaaon dwaara shasit the, jinhone british aatmahatya ko sweekaar kiya, ajmer-merwada sidhe angrejon dwaara prashasit kiya gaya tha

 Brajbhasha was the main literary language of Madhya Pradesh in India from the 13th century to the 20th century as well as the literary language of all India
 vibhinn sthaneey bhashaai samanvay ke saath samast bharat main vistrut rup se prayukt hone vaali hindi kaa purv rup yah ‘brajabhasha‘ apane vishuddh rup main aaj bhi agra, dhaulpur, mathura or aligarh jilon main boli jaati he jise ham 'kendriya brajabhasha' ke naam se bhi pukaar sakate hai
 Hindi-poetry was composed initially in Brajbhasha itself
 sabhi bhakt kaviyon, reetikalin kaviyon ne apni rachanaaen isi bhashaa main likhi hai jinamein pramukh hai surdaas, rahim, raskhaan, keshav, ghananand, bihari, ityadi
 In terms of language and style, there was a wide area of shaurseni or Western apostrophes
 brajabhasha ko ek prakaar se isi vyapak kshetra kii seemayen viraasat main mili thim
 The style-form of Brajbhasha touches boundaries far beyond the language-field
 kuch lekhakon ne brajabhasha naam se uske kshetra-vistaar kaa kathan kiya he
 Surajmal, the author of 'vansh Bhaskar', is considered to be between Braj Bhasha Pradesh Delhi and Gwalior
 'tuhaftul hind' ke rachayita mirza khan ne brajabhasha ke kshetra kaa ullekh is prakaar kiya he "bhashaa' braj tathaa uske paas-pados main boli jaati he
 Gwalior and Chandwar are also included in it
 ganga-yamuna kaa doaab bhi brajabhasha kaa kshetra he
 According to Lallujilal, the area of brajbhasha is "brajbhasha", which is the language spoken in Braj, District Gwalior, Bharatpur, Bateshwar, Bhadavar, Antveda and Bundelkhand
 isamen shabd mathura kshetra kaa vaachak he
 'lallujilal has also written that the Braj language of Braj and Gwalior is pure and refined
 grearsan ne brajabhasha-seemayen is prakaar likhi hai
 "mathura is the center
 dakshin main agre tak, bharatpur, dhaulpur or karauli tak brajabhasha boli jaati he
 The same is prevalent in the western parts of Gwalior and the eastern part of Jaipur
 uttar main isaki seemaa gudgaanv ke purvi bhaag tak pahunchati he
 In the northeast, its boundaries are up to Doab
 bulandshahr, aligarh, eta tathaa gangapar ke badaanu, bareli tathaa nainital ke tarai pargane bhi isi kshetra main he
 The language of the intermediate Doab is given the name Intuvedi

 ' kelaag ne likhaa he ki raajapootaana kii boliyon ke uttar-purv, puure apper doaab tathaa ganga-yamuna kii ghaatiyon main brajabhasha boli jaati he
 Dr
 Dhirendra Verma has not considered the Kannauji area specified by Grierson as distinct from the area of briji
 apane surveykshan ke aadhaar par unhone kanpur tak, brajbhaashi kshetra hi kaha he
 According to him, the districts of Mathura, Aligarh, Agra, Bulandshahar, Etah, Mainpuri, Badaun and Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh - eastern part of Punjab and Gurgaon district - Bharatpur, Dhaulpur, Karauli in Rajasthan and eastern part of Jaipur - Gwalior in central India
 The western part of the region falls in the Briji region
 chunki grearsan sahab kaa yah mat lekhak ko maanya nahin ki kannauji swatantra boli he, isliye uttar pradesh ke pilibhit, shahjahanpur, farrukhabad, hardoi, itawa or kanpur ke jile bhi brajabhasha kshetra main sammilit kar liye hai
 The area of brajbhasha spoken thus becomes extremely wide
 ek prakaar se pracheen madhyadesh kaa adhikansh bhaag isamen sammilit ho jaataa he
 Braj Bhasha became distinguished as poetry
 kai shatabdiyon tak isamen kavy- rachana hoti rahi
 Violation of the boundaries of the general Braj Bhasha-region created a greater area of braj Bhasha-style
 is baat kaa anumaan reetikaal ke kavi acharya bhikharidasji ne kiya
 He clearly stated that the introduction of Brajbhasha can also be found from poets living outside Braj
 yah nahin samajhnaa chahie ki brajabhasha madhur- sundar he
 Not only Sanskrit and Farsi, other languages also have a mix with it
 phir bhi brajabhasha style kaa vaishishty prakat rahata he
 This also proves that Braj Bhasha style was integrated with many languages
 vastav main 16veen shatee ke madhya tak brajabhasha kii mishrit style saare madhyadesh kii kavy-bhashaa ban gai thi
 Bhakti movement was also involved in expansion
 krishna-bhakthi kii rachanaaon main ek prakaar se yah style rudh ho gai thi
 Pt
 Vishwanath Prasad Mishra has revealed the geographical location of Braj Bhakta-poets of many states in this way - "braj's descendant - Meera dancing with unique sound of his footsteps with sound was from Rajasthan, Namdev was from Maharashtra, Narsi was from Gujarat, Bharatendu Harishchandra was from Bhojpuri language area
 


bihar main bhojpuri, magahi or maithili bhashaa kshetron main bhi brajabhasha ke kai pratibhashali kavi hue hai
 Earlier poets of Bengal also wrote poetry in Brajbhasha
 ' In the west, Rajasthan continued to use Brajbhasha styles in abundance, and in the west, Brajbhasha style was also extended to Gujarat and Kutch
 kuccha ke maharav lakhapat bade vidyapremi the
 He also opened a school for the promotion and training of Brajbhasha
 is prakaar madhyakaal main brajabhasha kaa prasar braj evam uske aasapaas ke pradeshon main hi nahin, purvavarti pradeshon main bhi rahaa
 In Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kathiawad and Kutch etc
 Brajbhasha compositions were also done
 brajabhasha style ke kshetra vistaar kii do sthitiyaan raheen
 The first situation arose from the sequence of language scientific history
 jab pashchimi yaa madhyadeshiy bhashaa anek kaarnon se apni bhugolic simaaon kaa ulanghan karne lagi, tab sthaneey rupon se samanvit hokar, vah ek visisth bhashaa style kaa rup grahan karne lagi
 Areas in which this text, rather than the language of language, have been molded into artificial, mixed and specific forms used only in literature, and have become embedded in specific occasions, contexts or poetic forms, will be considered as genre areas
 style-kshetra purvayugin bhashaa-vistaar yaa style-vistaar ke sahare badhata he
 The later forms of Western or Madhyapriya Apabhramsa expanded in this way
 duusari sthiti tab upasthit hui jab purv-parampara kii bhashaa-style kii kshetreey vistruti to prishthbhumi bani or shailigat kshetra-vistaar ke aitihaasik or vastugat kaaran bhi upasthit ho gaye

 The following sequence of numbers in mathematics is called Hemachandra series or Fibonacci series: paribhaasha ke anusaar, pehali do hemchandra sankhyaayein 0 or 1 hai
 Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers
 kuch log aarambhik 0 ko chhod dete hai, jisaki jagah do 1 ke saath anukram kii shuruuaat kii jaati he
 In mathematical terms, the f n sequence of Fibonacci numbers can be represented by the rotation relation- tathaa, The Fibonacci sequence is named after Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa, who was known as Fibonacci
 fibonachi dwaara likhit 1202 kii pustak liber abek ne pashchim europea ganit main is anukram ko pravartit kiya, haalanki pehle hi bhartiya ganit main is anukram kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 The Fibonacci sequence was very well known in ancient India, where it was applied to versification science long before it became prevalent in Europe
 iske vikaas kaa shrey pingala, virahanka, gopal, tathaa hemchandra ko diya jaataa he
 The Fibonacci sequence is prepared by adding s to a sample of n - 1 length, or by adding l to a sample of n - 2 length; And the scribes showed that samples of n length are the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence
 donald nuth ne da art of computer programing main is kaary kii samiksha kii he
 In the west, Leonardo of Pisa studied this sequence known as Fibonacci in his Liber Abaci
 unhone ek adarsh khargosh kii aabaadi ke vikaas par yah maanate hue vichaar kiya ki: Its rule is that one pair of rabbits produces 2 pairs in its lifetime and dies

 At this time, only those rabbits, which survived at n - 2 months, are fertile and produce offspring, so f pairs are added to the existing population F

 Like every sequence defined by linear rotation, the Fibonacci number has a whole-formula solution
 It is known as the Binet Sutra, although he was previously known as Abraham de Moivre: 
 Fibonacci Repatriation svarnim anupaat ke nirdharak sameekaran ke samaan nimnatah he Which is known as the productive polynomial of alternation
 uparyukt sameekaran kaa koi mul x 2 = x + 1, { \ displaystyle { \ begin{matrix}x^{2}=x+1, \ end{matrix}} \ ,} kaa samaadhaan karata he or x n − 1 { \ displaystyle x^{n-1} \ ,} dwaara guna karne se nimna darshata he: By definition φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi \ ,}, is the root of the equation and the second root is 1 - φ = - 1 / φ
 { \ displaystyle 1- \ varphi \ , = - 1 / \ varphi \ ,
}
 So: or Both φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n = n { \ displaystyle ^ {n} = ^ {n}} are geometric series that solve the Fibonacci alternation
 The first series expands exponentially; The second, exponentially, with alternating signs, leads to zero
 Since the Fibonacci alternation is linear, any linear combination of these two series can also solve the alternation
 These linear combinations create a two-dimensional linear vector difference; The original Fibonacci sequence can be found in this difference
 raikhik sanyojanon kii shrinkhlaayein φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^{n}} or n { \ displaystyle ^{n}}, a tathaa b gunankon sahit, nimna dwaara paribhaashit kii ja sakati hai All the series defined in this way satisfy the Fibonacci alternation
 jahaan apeksha he ki f a, b = 0 { \ displaystyle F_{a,b}=0} or f a, b = 1 { \ displaystyle F_{a,b}=1} pratifal a = 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle a=1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} or b = − 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle b=-1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} dete hai, jiske parinamswaroop vahi binet sutara miltaa he, jisase hamane shuru kiya tha
 yah darshaya gaya he ki yah sutara fibonachi prayaavartan kii purti karata he
 iske alaava, ek suspasht jaanch kii ja sakati he: And aagaman ke mul prashnon siddh karte hue, pramanit karte hai ki Therefore, for any two initial values, the combination a, b { \ displaystyle a, b} can be found such that the functions f a, b { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} \ ,}, are accurate to the sequence

 for example, f 1 = 1, f 3 = 2, f 5 = 5, f 7 = 13, f 9 = 34 = 2×17, f 11 = 89, f 13 = 233, f 15 = 610 = 2×5×61 ∑ k = nn + 9 f k = 11 f n + 6 { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {k = n} ^ {n + 9} F_ {k} = 11F_ {n + 6}} udhaaharan ke liye, let n = 1: f 1 + f 2 +

 + F11 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 = 231 = 11 × 21n = 3: F3 + F4 + 


 + F12 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144 = 374 = 11 × 34 vastutah, samaanika na keval dhanatmak, balki sabhi n purnankon ke liye sahi he: n = 0: F0+F1+


+F9 = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 = 88 = 11×8n = −1: f − 1 + F0 + 


 + F8 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 = 55 = 11 × 5n = −2: F−2+F−1+F0+


+F7 = −1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 33 = 11×3 It can be easily seen that if the units of the Fibonacci sequence take mod n, then the resulting sequence with at most n 2 rotations must be iterative
 Various n formulas, the extension of frequencies for the so-called Pisano rotation

 unki bhartee tathaa prashikshan ke koi niyam nahin the or in naukarshahon par bhi niyantran lagane vaali sanstha maujuud nahin thi
 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative
 vyaktigat kanoon or raja kii ichha kaa hi kanoon lagu hota tha
 As a result, there was a lack of uniform law code in the country and prevalence of different laws in different areas
 is avyavasthit or jatil kanoon ke kaaran janata ko apane hi kanoon kaa gyaan nahin tha
 The existence of this disorganized autocratic and sensitive governance system became painful for the people
 in utpeedak raajnneetik paristhitiyon ne kranti kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions
 francisi samaaj visham or vighatit tha
 That society was divided into three classes / states
 pratham stats main padri varg, dwitiya stats main kuleen varg evam tritiy stats main jansadharan shaamil tha
 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority
 kisaanon kii sankhya sarvaadhik thi or inaki dasha nimna or sochneey thi
 The peasants had to pay many taxes to the state, the church and other zamindars and the feudal tyrants had to bear
 ek drushti se kisaanon ke asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran saamanton dwaara die ja rahe ksht evam asuvidhaayen thi or rajtantr is par chuppi saadhe hue tha
 In this way, the peasants had become so grieved that they themselves turned into a revolutionary element and they needed only a sign to make revolution
 madhyam varg main sahukaar vyapaaree, shikshak, vakil, doctor, lekhak, kalakaar, karmchaaree aadi sammilit the
 His economic condition was certainly right, yet he was angry with the political, social and economic conditions of the time
 is varg ko koi raajnneetik adhikaar praapt nahin tha or padri or kuleen varg kaa vyavhaar inke prati acha nahin tha
 For this reason the middle class hated the social superiority of the nobles and was willing to change the political system and get their rights
 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class
 purv ke vaanijya vyapaar ke kaaran is varg ne dhansampatti arjeet kar lee thi kintu ab saamanti vaataavaran main unke vyapaar par kai tarah ke pratibandh lage the jagah-jagah chungi deni padati thi
 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable
 is tarah 1789 kii francisi kranti, francisi samaaj main asamanta ke viruddh sangharsh thi
 The economic condition of France was in trouble
 rajya diwaliyapan ke kagaar par pahunch gaya tha
 In fact the royal treasury was emptied due to the extravagance of the kings of France and the frequent wars of Louis the 14th
 uski mrityu ke baad lui 15wein ne austria ke uttaradhikaar yuddh evam saptavarshiya yuddh main bhaag liya jisase rajkosh par boj or badha or antat lui 16wein ne america swatantraaa yuddh main bhaag lekar france kii aarthik dasha ko or bhi jarjar bana diya
 An excessive amount of the state was spent on the emperor, empress and his family
 varsay kaa rajmahal rajkosh ke lutpaat kaa saadhan bana tha
 On the other hand the tax system was unsatisfactory
 visheshadhikaron ke kaaran sampann varg kar se mukt tha tathaa garib kisaan jo aarthik drushti se vipann tha, ekmaatr karadaata tha
 In this way the state of the treasury had become extremely thoughtful
 sarkaar france main aay ke anusaar vyay karne ke bajaay vyay ke anusaar aay ko nishchit karti thi
 The state was burdened with debt
 mul dhan kii to baat hi kya france byaaj chukaane main asamarth tha arthath rajya divaaliepan kii sthiti main pahunch gaya tha
 The country's economic malpractices could be improved by encouraging trade commerce, but the government's commercial policy was so uncontrolled and flawed that it did not make possible the development of production and trade in the state
 lui 16wein ne turgon, nekar jaise vitt salaahkaaron ke madhyam se aarthik sankat ko dur kanane kaa prayaas kiya lekin ye sudhaar prayaas lagu nahin ho sake kyonki visheshadhikaar praapt varg ne apane upar kar lagane kii baat sweekaar nahin kii
 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is
 francisi kranti main darshanikon kii bhoomika ke sandarbh main do mat saamne aate hai-ek, darshanikon ne kranti kii paristhitiyon ko janm dekar kranti ko utpann kiya or doosraa kranti kaa strot to us samay ke rashtriya jivan ke dosha main tathaa sarkaar kii bhuulon main tha or darshanikon ne kranti utpann nahin kii
 It would be desirable to understand the views of those philosophers and their relationship with the revolution before passing judgment on any opinion
 darshanikon ke vichaaron kii lokapriyata kaa nirdhaaran to us samay unke chape lekhon ke sanskarnon or prasar ke aadhaar par dekha janaa chahie
 Montescue in his book 'the Spirit of Laws' contradicted the principles of the king's divine rights and offered not only a critique of French political institutions but also an alternative
 usne likhaa ki francisi sarkaar nirkunsh sarkaar he kyonki france main karypalika, nyaaypalika or vidhayika sambandhi sabhi shaktiyaan ek hi vyakti arthath raja ke haathon main kendrit he isliye france kii janata ko swatantraaa praapt nahin he
 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi
 Thus his ideas that Montescue hurt France's autocratic state system through segregation of power became so popular that six editions were published in three years of 'the Spirit of Lodges'
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane kii baat yah he ki montescue ne na to kranti kii baat kii or na hi rajtantr ko samaapt karne kii usne to sirp nirankush rajtantr ke dosha ko ujagar kiya or sanvaidhanik rajtantr kii baat kii
 Voltaire illustrated the liberal politics, religion and freedom of thought of Britain through his book Letters on English and compared it to the ancient French system and noted the evils and shortcomings prevalent in France
 pratibandhit hone se purv ye pustaken bahut lokapriy hui thi
 "voltaire" wrote against the Church's corrupt pickles, intolerance, injustice, oppression and tyranny
 carch kii bhrashtataa par ungali uthaate hue usne likhaa ki ab to koi isai bachaa nahin kyonki ek hi isai tha or use suuli par chadha diya gaya
 He wrote that crush the notorious and infamous thing
 yah spasht rup se france ke nirankush rajtantr evam carch ke atyaachaar par prahaar tha
 Waltair wanted to establish a similar rule in France, in line with the constitutional monarchy of England
 usne kaha ki main sau chuhon ke sthaan par ek singh kaa shashan pasand karata hoon
 Voltaire did not speak of revolution but laid the background for freedom of thought
 usne puraatan francisi vyavastha kii buraaiyon ko ujagar kiya
 He presented to the people the mirror of the erstwhile French society and said that the mirror is called a stain
 ruso ne apni pustak “emily”, “soshal contract”, “rusoni” ke madhyam se manushya kii swatantraaa kii baat kii
 It said that despite being born free of human beings, everyone is chained with chains
 in zanjeeron se mukti paane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham prakritik aadim avasthaa kii ore laute
 The Russians said that it is the compulsory and universal duty of a state made by collective will to conduct the work considering the whole society as paramount
 jin logon ko karypalika shakti saupin gai he ve janata ke swami nahin uske kaaryakari he, or unka kartavya janata kii ajna kaa paalan karnaa he
 In this way he firmly believed that the paramount power should be in the hands of the public and not in the hands of any individual or institution
 saarvbhaum satta janata kii ichha main nihit he jise “saamaanya ichha” kaha gaya
 The law of the state should be an expression of this common desire, but the nature of the law is no longer such, but it is dependent on the will of the ruler
 ruson ne bhi kranti kii baat nahin kii lekin sabhi vyakti ko swatantra evam samaan mana or francisi kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav usee ke vichaaron se prabhavit the
 Napoleon acknowledged his importance and said that if there had not been the Russians, there would not have been a revolution in France

 The French scholar Didro is credited with compiling the works of the best thinkers of the 18th century and bringing them to the general public

 The French government considered the Daiders to be its greatest enemy and imposed several restrictions on his book

 He argued that only land is the primary source of all wealth

 By the time of the 16th, the French financial system had sunk into debt
 america swatantraaa sangram ne france ke divaaliepan par muhar laga di
 Therefore, in order to overcome the economic distress, the help of economists like Turks, Necker, Cologne took
 colon ne visheshadhikaar praapt kuleen varg par kar lagane kaa suzav diya jise kulinon ne asweekaar kar diya
 The meeting of the States General was finally called
 yah baithak 1789 se 175 varsh baad ho rahi thi
 All classes were excited to hear the news of the meeting of the States General
 kulina ummid thi ki is baithak main ve un visheshadhikaron ko praapt kar sakenge jo lui 14waan ke samay usne chhin liye gaye the
 The people of the middle class believed that they would be able to formulate progressive policies in their favor
 kisaanon ko aashaa thi ki vah saamanti visheshadhikaron ke viruddh aawaaj uthaakar apane adhikaron ko surakshit kar unke shoshan chakra se mukt ho sakenge
 In this way no significant portion of the French population was ready to support the French monarchy
 estats general ke adhiveshan main matadhikaar paddati ke mudde par tritiy state evam anya state ke bich vivaad ho gaya
 Voting was said that each state would be considered to have only one vote
 is prakaar visheshadhikaar praapt varg kaa do tathaa jansadharan kaa ek hi mat hota he
 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court
 francisi kranti vibhinn charnon se hote hue apane mukaam tak pahunchi
 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages
 is charan main paris kii bheed ne bastil ke kile par niyantran sthapit kiya
 This is how the revolution started
 vastutah bastil kaa kila nirankushta evam atyaachaar kaa pratik tha or iske patan se puraatan vyavastha kaa gahari chunauti mili
 The incident also affected the rural areas of France and the villagers set fire to the records of feudal taxes
 janata kii in kaarywahiyon kaa rashtriya sabha par bhi gaharaa asar padaa
 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791
 samvidhan main do baton par bal diya gaya-ek, rajya kii saarvbhaum shakti janata main nihit he or doosraa, shakti kaa pruthakkaran rajya evam janata ke hit main he
 Although the system of governance remained monarchical, the king's powers were limited

 The king did not have the right to make war or treaty with any country

 The citizens were divided into two parts, active and inactive, for the election of members of the administration and the franchise was given only to the active citizens
 sakriy naagarik 25 varsh se adhik aayu ke ve log the jo rajya ko teen din kii aay ke baraabar pratyaksh kar dete the jabaki niskriy naagarik ve the jo garib the
 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune
 prayek ikaiyon kaa shashan chalaane ke liye nirvachan parishad hoti thi jiskaa chunaav sakriy naagarik karte the
 In this way, the entire state system from the local level to the central level came to the Barja class

 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized
 paris kii bheed par inkaa prabhaav tha
 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc
 duusari taraf jirondist the- ye shikshit or susanskrit log the
 He had more book knowledge
 faltah ye vyaavhaarik raajnneetijna nahin the
 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc
 yahaan samajhane kii baat yah he ki donon hi gut ganatantr ke himachati the, videshi shaktiyon ke viruddh yuddh kaa samarthan karte the
 The difference was only in form
 vastutah jirodisto ne france main udaaravaadi sthaan grahan kar liya tha
 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prasha and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was referring to the referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives
 antat july 1794, main robspier kaid kar liya gaya or faansee de di gai isi ke saath aantak ke rajya kii samaapti hui
 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror
 udaaravaadi thermidorian netaaon ne desh kii satta sanbhali or aantak rajya kii vyavasthaaon ko bhang kiya, jacobiyans ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 In this way, the Directory of Rule in France began after the National Convention which lasted from 1795 to 1799
 atan main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar diya
 This directory rule was disorganized, sad
 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi
 In such a situation, the people of France felt the need for a ruler who could establish peace inside and outside the country and defeat foreign powers
 is kaal main nepolian ne sainya vijayon dwaara france ke sammaan ko sthapit kiya or antat diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar satta par niyantran sthapit kiya
 In 1799, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule and became the first Council of France and declared himself Emperor in 1804 and thus Napoleon's dictatorial imperialist rule began
 europe main france hi vah desh he jisane kranti ke madhyam se puraatan vyavastha ke patan ko sunishchit kiya
 The impact of this revolution was not limited to Europe
 isane samast vishwa ko prabhavit kiya
 The slogans of revolution spread freedom, equality and fraternity throughout Europe
 ek taraf isane jahaan rashtrawaad, janatantrwaad jaisi nai shaktiyon ko panpane kaa mauka diya to duusari taraf aadhunik taanaashaahee or sainikwaad kii neenv bhi daali
 The effects of the French Revolution can be understood under the following points: francisi kranti kii prakruti ko kranti ke aadarshon, kranti ke netritv, kranti kii pragati, kranti ke dauraan laae gaye parivartanon or vishwa par pade prabhaavon ke prakaash main samajhe jane kii jarurat he
 From this point of view, the revolution was a revolution that was started by the elite, then later it came into the hands of the middle class
 kuch samay ke liye yah krantikari tatwon ke prabhaav main rahi or ant ek sainik taanashaah ke saath hua
 In this way, the French Revolution started like a huge river that started from the high mountain peak and crossed several small mountains in the path, at a rapid, if slow, speed
 1789 main hui francisi kranti ko ek burjua kranti ke rup main dekha ja sakaata he
 The leadership in the first phase of the revolution was in the hands of the bourgeois elements of the Third State
 madhyavargeey netritv ne nijee sampatti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch siddhanth bhi banaaen
 In fact, the end of feudalism was declared but feudal rights were not only abandoned, but only after compensating the landlords, the peasants could be relieved of any responsibility
 maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa main madhyavargeey prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 The right to property was placed in the category of natural rights of man which is related to the protection of bourgeois interests
 isi prakaar vayask matadhikaar kii baat to kii gai kintu samvidhan main “naagarik” shabd kaa atyant sankuchit arthon main prayog kiya gaya
 Citizens were divided into active and passive citizens
 sakriy naagarik ve the jo apni kam se kam teen din ke aay kii rakam pratyaksh kar ke rup main adaa karte the or sirp inhen hi mat dene kaa adhikaar tha
 The ability of property to be representative was also made a basis and it was only the rich who could participate in political activities and this meant that the rich people belonged to the middle class
 is tarah francisi kranti ne janm par aadhaarit bhedbhaav ko nasht kiya parantu uske jagah pracheen samantvaad ke badale dhan par aadhaarit nae samantvaad kaa prabhutv hua
 During the revolution, the revolutionaries talked about the loans taken by the autocratic government, but no one talked about forgiving those loans
 iskaa kaaran tha yah rin sarkaar ko burjua varg ne diya tha
 Similarly, the government seized the property of the church but it was not distributed to the landless
 jameenon ko sarvaadhik oonchi keemton par bechaa gaya or is jameen ko kharidne kii kshamta madhyavarg ke paas thi
 The French Revolution ignored the interests of the workers and discouraged the labor movement
 kranti ke dauraan shramik varg ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi kintu burjua netritv ko uski badhati sthiti manjuur nahin thi
 Therefore, the National Assembly re-enacted the laws made in the autocratic monarchy era
 jiske tahat sabhi shramik sangh sambandhi kaaryon par pratibandh laga diya gaye or gildon ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In the National Assembly, the bourgeoisie dominated and the Jirondist and Jacobians also belonged to the bourgeoisie
 yadhyapi jacobiyan sarvhaara varg ke hit kii baat karte the parantu aatank ke rajya kii sthapana main burjua hiton ko hi upar rakhaa gaya or shramikon pratikriyaaon ko dabaane hetu sena kii sahaayta lee gai
 Middle-class interests were also given prominence in directory governance
 sanchaalak mandal ne jis dwisadani vidhayika kaa nirmaan kiya uske sabhi sadsy madhyavargeey buddhijivi the
 The bourgeoisie effect can also be seen on Napoleon's reforms
 usne burjua hiton ko sangrakshit rakhte hue apni vidhi samhita main sampatti ke adhikaar ko surakshit rakhaa, kulinon ko apekshaakrit vyapak adhikaar die tathaa uske vyapaarik or vanijyik sudhaaron kaa phayda madhyavarg ko hi mila
 In this way, middle class elements are seen in the form of revolution
 kintu puure kranti or uske prabhaav ke vishleshan se yah spasht hota he ki kranti main madhyavargeey tatwon ke saath krishak, majdoor, mahilaon kii sahamaagita thi
 In this way, it was not just a middle class revolution, but it can be seen as a popular revolution
 francisi kranti ek vishwavyaapee charitra ko liye hue thi
 The revolutionaries declared human and civil rights in 1789, under which it was said that being born equal from birth, all human beings should get equal rights and this is for all nations, for all human beings, for all time and for example
 Are for the world
 yah ghoshnaa sirp france ke liye nahin varan har jagah ke un sabhi logon kii bhalaai ke liye hai jo swatantra hona chaahate the tathaa nirankush rajtantr evam saamanti visheshadhikaron ke boj se mukti paanaa chaahate the, banaaya gaya tha
 In 1792 AD, the English hero named Kompene was awarded the title of French citizen by the National Assembly and was also elected a delegate to the National Convention
 isi prakaar kranti ke dauraan yah vichaar aayaa ki kranti ko sthaayee or sudrudh rakhane ke liye ise europe ke anya deshon main bhi vistaarit kiya jaaen
 It envisages a war in which French forces enter neighboring countries and meet local revolutionaries and overthrow the monarchy and establish republics
 france kii kranti maatr ek rashtriya ghatana nahin thi apitu siddhanton- swatantraaa, samanta evam bandhutav ke naaron se sampurna europe gunj uthaa
 The effects of the revolution were so far-reaching that all of Europe was covered by it

 is samay hamaare saamne yah prashan uthta he ki 1789 i
 main kranti kaa sutrapat anya europe deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi kyon hui
 a study of European nations of the 18th century showed that the condition of France at that time was worse than that of other Europe nations
 nirankush rajtantr suvidha yukt varg or karon ke asaahneey bhaar se dabaa hua tha
 Ordinary classes were present in almost all European countries

 French farmers were happier than other European nations
 saadhaaran varg kii sthiti anya europe rajyon main or bhi kharaab thi
 Nevertheless, the revolution took place not in these countries but in France first
 iskaa pramukh kaaran yah tha kii france log apni sthiti ke prati jaagruk the
 It is not a necessary condition for revolution that its explosion takes place in the same countries where people are victims of atrocities, incest and exploitation
 samrudh or unnat desh main bhi kranti ho sakati he

 There were many reasons for this revolution which are as follows
 frasisi saamanton kaa badla hua swarup or kisaano kii unnat avasthaa- Such was the reason for the advanced state of French peasants and the changed nature of feudalism
 jiske chalate france main sarv pratham rajyakranti hui
 Farmers in the European country were still in a state of gloom
 parantu france ke kisaan swatantra ho chuke the
 They did not own their own land and own their own land in spite of such convenience and feudal services, they had to pay a large part of their income in the form of feudal tax
 or phir bhi uski sthiti acchhee dhi
 They used to buy some land by saving money and the hunger to buy land was constantly increasing, there was a problem of feudalism and unemployment, so they were thinking of removing the feudal occupations, so they got strength under the leadership of the middle class
 And in 1789 AD they revolted
 france main udaar nirankushta kii parampara kaa abhaav- Other European countries also had autocratic monarchies
 parantu vahaan ke samraaton ne samaynusaar apni nirankushta main kami kar di thi
 King Fredirak of Prasha was the great enlightened administrator of his time
 jiskaa anusaran europe ke anya desh rus germany, italy, spain aadi ne kiya
 In due course of time, he tried as much as possible to improve the economic, physical and other fields
 parantu france main is tarah ki udaar nirankushta kaa abhaav tha
 The kings there were doing nothing for the benefit of the people
 balki adhik tex vasulanaa or janata kaa shoshan karnaa unki niti ban gai thi
 Therefore, the French people were fed up with it, so the people of France wanted to end the autocratic monarchy
 maadyam varg kii jaagarukta- The reason for the first revolution in France was the middle class there
 anya deshon main bhi madhyam varg thi parantu ve france kii tarah saanskriti, dhani evam shikshit nahin the
 He lacked strength
 ve raja ke khilaaf baghawat karne kii soch nahin sakate the
 The middle class people in France were dissatisfied with their emperors for many reasons
 or apni raksha ke liye raaj satta par ankush lagane ke liye utawala ho rahe the
 Other European states lacked this type of situation
 anya deshon main netritv karne vaala koi nahin tha france main jaagruk madhyamvarg taiyaar tha
 Therefore, revolution first took place in France itself
 kulinvarg kii anupayogita- The elite Vigyan was given the first privilege to help the king in running the rule
 or ve janaata kii raksha bhi karte the
 But slowly - 2 started doing this work for the king's employees
 falat: kulinon kii upyogita samaapt ho gai
 Yet there was no cut in its prerogative
 isliye kisaan or madhyam varg ke log kulinvarg se ghrinaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries
 vahaan abhi bhi kulinon ki payogita bani hui thi
 The influence of philosophers 18 veen shatabdi main sampoorn europe main boudik halchal machi hui thi
 Philosophers, thinkers, scientists were present in all countries
 parantu unamem mukhya france ke vichaarak the
 Who presented the psychological basis of the revolution
 unhone samaaj main vaypt buraaiyon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrisht karaayaa or muk janata ko vaani di
 Such an attempt was not being made in other countries
 montegu, waltare ruso aadi vichaarkon kaa kaary kshetra france hi tha
 Austria, Prasha and Russia did not have such thinkers
 europe ke anya deshon main logon kaa unki vaastavik sthiti bataane vaala or unamem santosh paidaa karne vaala darshanikon kaa koi varg nahin tha
 This was a major reason for revolution in France itself
 raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaa abhaav- When the middle class became aware in England, they were given the opportunity to participate in the politics of the country
 parantu france ke saath aisi baat nahin thi
 The middle class of France was quite dissatisfied with its emperors
 unki apeksha kii jaati thi
 Despite being educated, they did not have a reputation like the nobles
 unhen france kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, he dissented and raised the slogan of revolution
 ayogy raja tathaa prashasan main bhrashtachar- The political system of France was centralized but the kings were inept
 prashasan main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha
 In other countries of Europe, autocratic rule was broken but kings were eligible and they had full control over governance
 france kaa madhyam varg is prashasnic bhrashtatar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 And so he was ready to revolt
 rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai- At this time, national sentiment began to rise rapidly in Europe
 sampoorn europe main france hi ek aisa desh tha jahaan ek raashtra bhaavana kaa purnat: abhaav tha
 Due to this, there was a revolution in France for the first time
 america swatantraaa sangram kaa prabhaav- The American War of Independence started in 1766 AD
 gimen america ke logon ne england ke khilaaf vidroh kar kar diya
 The soldiers of France also got an opportunity to participate in this freedom struggle, so they felt that freedom can be achieved through war
 unhone yah bhi anubhav kiya ki swatantraaa so hi sukh kii prapti sambhav he
 On returning to France, he saw that the freedom he fought for in America is the complete lack of freedom in France
 at: ve yahan kii kranti ke liye baichaiyn ho uthe or yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa praapt karne kii cheshtaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries of Europe
 francisi sabhyataa kii shreshthata- a specific reason for the revolution in France itself was that the civilization and culture of other Europe was more prosperous and rich than other European nations
 shashan vyavastha kii drushti se bhi france kaa shashan atyadhik suvyavasthit tha
 France is considered a symbol of civilization and culture throughout Europe
 sampoorn europe main paris sahitya or chintan kaa sabase bada kendra mana jaataa he
 The France public opinion was more aroused and critical than other European states

 anuchhed 344 main yah kaha gaya ki samvidhan prarambh hone ke 5 varshon ke baad or phir uske 10 varsh baad raashtrapati ek ayog banaayenge, jo anya baton ke saath saath sangh ke sarkari kaamkaaj main hindi bhashaa ke uttarottar prayog ke bare main or sangh ke rajkeey prayojanon main se sab yaa kisi ke liye angrezi bhashaa ke prayog par roak lagaae jane ke bare main raashtrapati ko sifarish karegaa
 In order to consider the recommendations of the Commission, according to clause 4 of this article, a committee of 30 Members of Parliament was also arranged
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 120 main kaha gaya he ki sansad kaa kaary hindi main yaa angreji main kiya ja saktaa he
 By 1965, it had been 15 years, but even then English was not removed and Article 334 empowered the Parliament to make arrangements to continue to use English in official work even after 1965
 angreji or hindi donon bharat kii rajbhasha he
 On 26 January 1965, Parliament passed a resolution that "hindi will be used in all official functions, but English will also be used as a co-official language
" " varsh 1967 main sansad main "bhashaa sanshodhan vidheyak" laayaa gaya
 After this, English was made compulsory
 is vidheyak main dhara 3 main hindi kii charchaa tak nahin kii gai
 After this, opposition to English started
 5 disambar 1967 ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne rajyasabha main kaha ki ham is vidheyak main vichaar vimarsh karenge
 In a book "question of the National Language" published in the year 1990, Shailesh Matiani ji asked why we celebrate Hindi Day on 14 September
 is par premanarayan shukla ji ne hindi diwas ke din elahabaad main iske kaaran ko bataaya tha ki is din hi hindi bhashaa ke liye kai mahatvapurn nirnay liye gaye the
 For this reason, this day is celebrated as a national festival
 lekin ve is jawaab se santusht nahin the
 He said why we do not celebrate this day as National Language or Official Language Day
 iske saath hi shailesh ji ne is din hindi diwas manaane ko sharmnaak paakhand qaraar diya tha

85holapur handiya, elahabaad, uttar pradesh sthit ek gaanv he
 Raktras have a color called bile, which in turn causes a yellow color in the skin and mucous membranes
 is dasha ko kamla yaa pilia kehete hai
 Generally, the level of cholecyst in Raktras is 1
0 percent or less, but when its volume is above 2
5 percent, then the symptoms of Kamala appear
 kamla swayan koi rogvishesh nahin he, balki kai rogon main paaya janevaala ek lakshan he
 This symptom can occur in children from young to young children up to 80 years of age
 yadi pittaranjak kii vibhinn upaapachayik prakriyaaon main se kisi main bhi koi dosha utpann ho jaataa he to pittaranjak kii adhikta ho jaati he, jo kamla ke kaaran hoti he
 Excessive destruction of red particles in the blood and consequent overproduction of indirect bile is the cause of diseases in children, blood-cell destruction and other congenital, or acquired, blood-cell-destroy-anemia in newborns
 jab yakrut kii koshikaaye aswasth hoti hai tab bhi kamla ho saktaa he, kyonki ve apana pittaranjak mishran kaa swaabhaavik kaary nahin kar paatin or yah vikruti sankramak yakritpradah, raktarasiya yakritpradah or yakrut kaa pathara janaa ityadi prasiddh rogon kaa kaaran hoti he
 Finally, if there is a blockage in the bile, there is a collection of more direct bile in the bile system and this direct bile is reabsorbed into the blood and produces kamala
 agnashay, sir, pittamarg tathaa pittapranali ke canceron main, pittashmari kii upasthiti main, janmajaat paittik sankoch or pittamarg ke vikrut sankoch ityadi shalya rogon main margavirodh yakrut baahar hota he
 In internal liver diseases, there is inhibition in the vessels inside the liver, so in addition to direct bile, there is an excess of direct bile in the blood
 vaastavik rog kaa nidaan kar sakane ke liye pittaranjak kaa upaapachay samajhnaa aavashyak he
 Red blood cells are destroyed in blood circulation, and thus the released hemoglobin, after various compounding processes in the reticulo-endothelial system, converts into a bile, which is widely spread in the body, but its greater spleen
 Assembles in yah pittaranjak ek protein ke saath mishrit hokar raktaras main sancharit hota rahata he
 This is called indirect bile
 yakrut ke saamanyat: swasth anu is apratyaksh pittaranjak ko grahan kar lete hai or usamen glucoronic amla mila dete hai yakrut kii koshikaon main se gujarata hua pittamarg dwaara pratyaksh pittaranjak ke rup main choti aanton kii ore jaataa he
 In the intestines, this bile is converted into urobilinogen, some parts of which are exploited and pass along to the ruckus, and some parts, which give their brown color to the estuary, are removed from the body
 prayek dasha main rogi kii aankh kii twachaa pili ho jaati he, saath hi saath rogvishesh kaabhi lakshan miltaa he
 By the way, the spleen of the patient is enlarged, the cell is brown or clay colored, more and smooth
 bhukh kam lagati he
 The taste of metal remains in the mouth
 naadee ke gati kam ho jaati he
 Due to lack of proper exploitation of vitamin 'K' and blood circulation starts to block
 pittamarg main kaaphi samay tak avrodh rahane se yakrut kii koshikaaye nasht hone lagati hai
 At that time, the patient becomes relaxed, semi-dendritic and sometimes completely deranged and dies
 kamla ke upachaar ke purv rog ke kaaran kaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 For this, blood tests, blood tests and liver-functioning are done
 isse yah pataa lagata he ki yah rakt main laal kanon ke adhik nasht hone se he yaa yakrut kii koshikaaye aswasth hai athwa pittamarg main avrodh hone se he
 In the treatment of jaundice, the causes that cause it are eliminated for which it is necessary to hospitalize the patient
 kuch mirch, masala, tel, ghi, protein purnroopen band kar dete hai, kuch logon ke anusaar kisi bhi khaadyasamagree ko purnroopen na band kar, rogi ke upar hi chhod diya jaataa he ki vah jo pasand kare, kha saktaa he
 The drug is usually given tetracycline and neomycin
 kabhi-kabhi carticositerid kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he jo yakrut main fibrosis or avrodh utpann nahin hone detaa
 Medicines are given for liver to perform its function properly, such as Liv-52, Hipliv, Livomin etc
 kamla ke pittaranjak ko rakt se nikaalane ke liye kynatomin kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Due to negligence in the treatment of Kamala, when the disease becomes chronic, then new problems arise from one to one and the patient goes through various conditions
 pilia rog Viral hepatitis or jaundice is commonly known as jaundice
 yah rog bahut hi sookshm vishaanu se hota he
 Initially, when the disease is slow and mild, its symptoms do not appear, but when it takes a violent form, the eyes and nails of the patient become yellow, people call it jaundice
 jin virus se yah hota he uske aadhaar par mukhyatah pilia teen prakaar kaa hota he viral hepatitis e, viral hepatitis bi tathaa viral hepatitis naan e va naan bi
 How the spread of the disease? yah rog zyaadaatar aise sthano par hota he jahaan ke log vyaktigat va vaataavaraniya safai par kam dhyaan dete hai athwa bilkul dhyaan nahin dete
 It is also more prevalent in crowded areas
 viral hepatitis bi kisi bhi mausam main ho saktaa he
 Viral hepatitis a and Nae and Naan b occur from close contact with one person to another
 ye virus rogi ke mel main hoten he pilia rog se peedit vyakti ke mel se, dooshit jal, doodh athwa bhojan dwaara iskaa prasar hota he
 It may happen that the eyes, nails or body of some patients are not looking yellow but if they are suffering from this disease then they can spread the disease like other diseases
 viral hepatitis bi khun va khun va khun se nirmit pradaartho ke aadan pradaan evam yon kriya dwaara failata he
 In this he becomes a person and also makes him a patient
 yahan khun dene vaala rogi vyakti rog vaahak ban jaataa he
 The disease can be spread even if injected with a boiled needle and syringe
 pilia rog se grast vyakti virus, nirog manushya ke sharir main pratyaksh rup se anguliyon se or apratyaksh rup se rogi ke mel se yaa mackhiyon dwaara pahunch jate hai
 This also causes health disease to humans
 rog kahan or kab? a type of jaundice and Naan a and Naan b jaundice are found all over the world
 bharat main bhi is rog kii mahamari ke rup main failane kii ghatnayen prakaash main ai hai
 Although this disease can occur at any time of the year, in August, September and October months people are more prone to this disease
 sardi shuru hone par iske prasar main kami aa jaati he
 Symptoms of the disease: - pilia rog ke kaaran haih- Who can get the disease? yah rog kisi bhi avasthaa ke vyakti ko ho saktaa he
 Yes, the exacerbation of the disease depends on the condition of the patient
 garbhvatee mahila par is rog ke lakshan bahut hi ugr hote hai or unhe yah zyada samay tak ksht detaa he
 Similarly, in newborns, it is very violent and can be fatal
 bi prakaar kaa viral hepatitis vyavsaayik khun dene vaale vyaktiyon se khun praapt karne vaale vyaktiyon ko or maadak dawaaon kaa seven karne vaale evam anjaan vyakti se yon sambandhon dwaara logon ko zyada hota he
 Complications of the disease: - zyadatar logon par is rog kaa akraman saadhaaran hi hota he
 But sometimes due to the severity of the disease, hard liver defects occur
 bi prakaar kaa pilia zyada gambheer hota he isamen jatiltaayen adhik hoti he
 It also has a high death rate
 upachaar:- Disease prevention and prevention pilia rog ke prakope se bachane ke liye kuch saadhaaran baton kaa dhyaan rakhana jaruri haih- Health workers take note yadi aapke kshetra main kisi parivaar main rog ke lakshan vaala vyakti ho to use doctor ke paas jane kii salaah den
 Talk about personal cleanliness and environmental hygiene in the area and try to arrange for the removal of garbage, garbage, feces, urine etc
 from the panchayat etc
 rogi kii dekhbhaal thik ho, aisa parivaar ke sadasyon ko samajhaayen
 Explain to the patient who does all the work by washing hands thoroughly
 swasthya kaaryakarta syringe va sui 20 minutes tak ubaal kar athwa dispojable kaam main len
 Wear gloves while taking the patient's blood and during surgery and boil the tools coming in contact with the blood properly
 rakt va sambandhit shaareerik dravya pradaartho par keetanunashak daal kar hi unhe upyukt sthaan par phenke athwa nasht karen
 a little caution - avoid jaundice pilia ke parinaamon ko samajhane ke liye, pilia utpann karne vaali rogaatmak prakriyaaon ko avashya samajhnaa chahie
 pilia apane aap main koi beemaari nahin he, balki yah kai sambhav moolbhoot rogaatmak prakriyaaon kaa ek lakshan he jo billirubin ke chayapachay ke saamaanya shaareerik kaaryon ke kram main kabhi utpann hota he
 When red blood cells complete their life span of about 120 days, or when they are damaged, their membranes become weak and prone to erosion
 jab prayek laal rakt koshika jaalilant:kala pranali se hokar guzarati he, to isaki jhilli koshika atyadhik kamjor hone ke kaaran ise dhaaran nahin kar paati he or koshika jhilli cat-fat jaati he
 Cell contents, including hemoglobin, are subsequently released into the blood
 haemoglobin kaa macrophesso ke dwaara jeevanu bhakshan kiya jaataa he or yah iske hemi or globin bhaagon main vibhajit hota he
 The globin portion, which is a protein, is degraded into amino acids and has no role in jaundice
 tab heme anu ke saath do pratikriyaayein hoti hai
 The first oxidation reaction is catalyzed by the microtubule enzyme heme oxygenase and results in biliverdin, iron and carbon monoxide
 aglaa kadam he koshika dravya ke anzime beliverdin ridctage ke dwaara beliverdin kaa ek pile rang ke tetrapyrol varnak billirubin main apchayan
 yah billirubin "asanyugmit," "mukt" yaa "apratyaksh" billirubin hota he
 About 4 mg of bilirubin is produced per kilogram per day
 inamen se adhikansh billirubin mrit laal rakt koshikaon se hemi ke tuutane se abhi bataai gai prakriya se aata he
 However, about 20 percent comes from other hemi sources, including the formation of ineffective red blood cells and breakdown of other heme-containing proteins, such as muscle-related myeloglobin and cytochrome
 phir asanyugmit billirubin rakt pravaah se hokar yakrut main pahunchataa he
 Because this bilirubin is not soluble, however, it is transported through the blood to the serum esophagus
 ek baar yakrut main pahunch kar yah jal main adhik ghulansheel banane ke liye glucuronic amla ke saath sanyugmit hota he 
 yah abhikriya anzime udipi-glucuronide transferez dwaara utprerit hoti he
 This conjugated bilirubin secretes from the liver as part of the bile and enters the gallbladder and bladder drains
 aant sambandhi jeevanu billirubin ko eurobilinosen main parivartit karata he
 From here Eurobilinozen can take two routes
 yah yaa to iske baad stercobilinosen main parivartit ho saktaa he, jo phir stercobilin main oxikrut ho jaataa he or mel main chhod diya jaataa he yaa aant kii koshikaon dwaara yah pun: avashoshit kar liya ja saktaa he, gurdon main rakt main pahunchaa diya jaataa he or oxikrut utpaada eurobilin ke rup main mutr main chhod diya jaataa he
 Stercobilin and urobilin products are responsible for the color of feces and urine, respectively
 jab koi rogaatmak prakriya chayapachay ke saamaanya kaary main hastkshep karti he or billirubin ke utsarjan kii soochna sahi dhang se di jaati he, to iske parinamswaroop pilia ho saktaa he
 Jaundice can be divided into three categories, depending on the organs of the physiological system affected by the pathological function
 teen shreniyan hai: First jaundice in the liver occurs due to any reason that increases the rate of blood degeneration
 ushnkaribandheey deshon main malaria is tareeke se pilia utpann kar saktaa he
 Some genetic diseases such as sickle-bound blood cell anemia, globularity, and a deficiency of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase can induce an increase in cell degeneration and hence hemorrhagic jaundice
 aamtaur par, gurde kii bimaariyaan, jaise ki rudhirlayi uremiajanit sanglakshan se varnataa bhi ho sakati he
 Disorders in the metabolism of bilirubin can also cause jaundice
 pilia main aam taur par ucch taapmaana ke saath bukhaar aata he
 Jaundice can also occur from a fever caused by a rat bite
 prayogshaala ke nishkarshon main shaamil hai: Liver jaundice causes severe hepatitis, liver toxicity, and alcoholic liver disease, by which cell necrosis decreases the liver's ability to metabolize and excrete bilirubin to form blood
 kam aam kaarnon main shaamil hai praathmik pitt sutaranrog,, gilbert sanglakshan, krigler-najjar sanglakshan, vikshepi karkatrog or nimen-pick rog, varg si
 navjaat shishu main paaya jane vaala pilia, jise navjaat pilia kaha jaataa he, aamtaur par praaia: prayek navjaat shishu main hota he kyonki sanyog or billirubin ke utsarjan ke liye yakrut sambandhi rachanaatantr lagbhag do saptaah tak kii aayu ke pehle purna rup se paripakv nahin hota he
 Laboratory findings include: yakrut ke baahar hone vaala pilia, jise pratirodhatmak pilia bhi kaha jaataa he, pitt pranali main pitt kii nikasi main hone vaale avarodhon ke kaaran hota he
 The most common causes are gallstones in the common bile duct and pancreatic cancer at the top of the pancreas
 In addition, a group of parasites, called "liver parasites", can live in the common bile duct, which can cause obstructive jaundice
 anya kaarnon main aam pitt nalee ke strot main avrodh, pitt avivarataa, nalika sambandhi carcinoma, agnyashayshoth or agnashyi kutakoshika shaamil hai
 An unusual cause of obstructive jaundice is mirizi syndrome
 pile malon or kaale mutr kii upasthiti ek pratirodhatmak yaa yakrut ke baahar hone vaale kaaran ko suchit karata he kyonki saamaanya mel ko pitt varnak se rang praapt hota he
 Patients may occasionally present excessive serum cholesterol and often complain of severe itching or "itching"
 koi bhi ek jaanch pilia ke vibhinn vargikarnon ke bich antar spasht nahin kar saktaa he
 a mixture of liver function tests is required to arrive at a diagnosis
 navjaat sambandhi pilia aamtaur par hanirahit hota he: yah avasthaa aksar navjaat shishuon main janm ke baad lagbhag duusare hi din dekhi jaati he
 This condition lasts until the 8th day in normal deliveries, or until the 14th day if born prematurely
 serum billirubin bina kisi aavashyak hastkshep ke nimna str tak chalaa jaataa he: pilia sambhawatah janm ke baad ek chayapachay or shaareerik anukulan kaa parinaam he
 In extreme conditions, a brain damage condition can cause brain cancer, which can lead to significant lifelong disability
 is baat kii chintaa kii ja rahi he ki aparyaapt khoj or navjaat billirubin kii adhikta ke aparyaapt upachaar ke kaaran haal ke varshon main yah sthiti badhati ja rahi he
 Early treatment often involves infants undergoing intensive phototherapy
 kabhi yah vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki pilia se peedit vyaktiyon ko sab kuch pilaa hi dikhaai detaa tha
 By going into detail, the jaundiced eye was interpreted to mean a biased view, which was generally more negative or more accusatory
 alexander pope ne "ain aanse on critisism" main likhaa:" sankramit jasoos ko har koi sankramit maaloom padataa he, jaisaa ki pakshpatpurna drushtikon ko har jagah pakshpaat hi dikhataa he"
 isi prakaar 19 veen shatabdi ke madhya main angreji kavi lord alfred tennisan ne apni kavita loxli haul main likhaa: "so i triumphe'd ere my passion sweeping thro' me left me dry, left me with the palsied heart, and left me with a jaundiced eye
" Most patients with jaundice will have different predictive methods of liver plaque abnormalities, although there are certainly significant changes
 vishisht yakrut falak main pramukh rup se yakrut se praapt anzimon ke rakt str shaamil honge, jaise ki eminotransferez or kshareey bhasvied ; billirubin ; or protein ke str, vishesh rup se, kul protein or shviti 
 yakrut ke kaary ke liye anya pramukh prayogshaala pareekshanon main GGT or prothombin time shaamil hai
 Some bone and heart disorders can increase ALP and aminotransferase
 isaliye yakrut sambandhi samasya se unke antar nikaalane kii disha main pratham kadam GGT ke staron kii tulana karnaa he, jo keval yakrut sambandhi vishisht sthitiyon main badhegaa
 doosraa kadam pilia ke pitt sambandhi yaa yakrut sambandhi kaarnon or parivartit prayogshaala pareekshanon se antar spasht karnaa he
 The first specifically indicates a surgical response, while the second specifically relies on a response to a medical examination
 ALP or GGT str vishesh rup se par ek hi tareeke se bad jaaenge jabaki AST or ALT ek alag tareeke se badhenge
 yadi ALP or GGT str AST or ALT ke oonchai ke anupaat main badhate hai to yah pittaruddh kamla kii samasya ko suchit karata he
 On the other hand, if the increase in AST and ALT is significantly higher than the increase in ALP and GGT, then it indicates a liver problem
 ant main, pilia ke yakrut sambandhi kaarnon ke bich antar pataa karne main AST or ALT ke staron kii tulana upyogi sabit ho sakati he
 The AST level will usually be higher than the ALT level
 This condition persists in most liver disorders except hepatitis

 Jagtar was a famous Punjabi poet
 aalochana yaa samalochna kisi vastu / vishay kii, uske lakshya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, uske gun-dosha evam upyuktatta kaa vivechan karne wali saahitiyik vidha he
 The beginning of Hindi criticism is considered to be from the Bharatendu era of the late 19th century
 'samalochna' kaa shabdic arth he - 'acchhee tarah dekhnaa'
 The word 'criticism' is made of 'luch' metal
 'luch' kaa arth he 'dekhnaa'
 The words review and criticism also have the same meaning
 angreji ke 'critisism' shabd ke samanaarthi rup main 'aalochana' kaa vyavhaar hota he
 The word criticism is also used for 'commentary-interpretation' and 'poetry-theory' as practiced in Sanskrit, but Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is clear that modern criticism is something independent of Sanskrit's poetry-theory
 aalochana kaa kaary he kisi sahityak rachana kii acchhee tarah pariksha karke uske rup, ganu or arthvyastha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has given the definition of criticism in these words: arthath aalochana kaa kartavya sahityak kriti kii vishleshan parak vyakhya he
 Criticism analyzes those elements of the synthesis of literature from the life and spirit of life
 sahitya main jahaan raagatatv pradhan he vahaan aalochana main buddhi tatv
 Criticism also assesses historical, social, political conditions and pupils and discusses their impact on literature
 vyaktigat ruchi ke aadhaar par kisi kriti kii ninda yaa prashansa karnaa aalochana kaa dharm nahin he
 Methodism and system are important in criticism for the interpretation and analysis of work
 aalochana karte samay aalochak apane vyaktigat raag-dwesh, ruchi-aruchi se tabhi batch saktaa he jab paddati kaa anusaran kare, vah tabhi vastunishth hokar sahitya ke prati nyaay kar saktaa he
 From this point of view, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is considered the best critic in Hindi
 aalochana karte samay jin manyataon or paddatiyon ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he, unke anusaar aalochana ke prakaar viksit ho jate hai
 Four types of review are generally accepted: - saiddhanthik aalochana main sahitya ke siddhanton par vichaar hota he
 In it, ancient classical poetry - Rasa, Alankar etc
 and modern beliefs and rules of literature are mainly disseminated
 saiddhanthik aalochana main vichaar kaa bindu yah he ki sahitya kaa maandand shastreey he yaa aitihaasik
 The classical form of a norm is static and unchangeable, but considering the criteria as a historical category, their form is variable and developmental
 donon prakaar kii saiddhanthik aalochanaayen uplabdh hai
 But now the importance of the same theoretical criticism which assumes development in the historical process of elements and rules of literature
 nishchit siddhanton keadhar par jab sahitya ke ganu-dosha, shreshth-nikrusht kaa nirnay kar diya jaataa he tab use nirnayaatmak aalochana kehete hai
 It is also considered a type of moral criticism
 iskaa mukhya swabhaav nyaayadhish kii tarah sahityak kritiyon par nirnay dena he
 Such criticism often uses the principle mechanically
 isliye nirnayaatmak aalochana kaa mahatva kam ho jaataa he
 Although creating a sense of value or superior literature and inferior literature is one of the main religions of criticism, but it is not possible by mechanical use of principles
 'hindi sahitya kosh' main nirnayaatmak aalochana ke vishay main bataaya gaya he: Thus judgment in criticism is not the point of dispute as much as the method adopted for decision
 jasai, ramachandra shukla kii aalochana main mulya nirnay he, lekin uskaa tarika srujanaatmak he, yantric nahin
 Judicial criticism lacks flexibility in both value and method
 is aalochana main kavy kaa jo prabhaav aalochak keman par padataa he use vah sajile pad-vinyas main vyast kar detaa he
 Personal interest is main in this
 prabhavabhivyajunk samalochna koi thaȥk-ǒthakaane kii vastu nahin he
 Neither is its value in the field of knowledge nor in the field of emotion
