 Sufism is a principle affirming moral expectations under ethics
 sukhwad ke anusaar achchhai vah he jo anand pradaan karti he yaa dukh-pidaa se chhutkaaraa dilaati he tathaa buraai vah he jo dukh-pidaa ko janm detii he

 Game is the natural action of the child
 bhinn-bhinn aayu varg ke bachche vibhinn prakaar ke khel khelte hai
 These different types of games help in the overall development of children
 khel se bacchon kaa shaareerik vikaas, sangyanatmak vikaas, samvegatmak vikaas, saamaajik vikaas evam naitik vikaas ko badhaava miltaa he kintu abhibhavakon kii khel ke prati nakaaratmak abhivritti evam kriyalap ne buree tarah prabhavit kiya hai
 Therefore, it is essential that teachers and parents understand the importance of sports
 khelon ke prakaaron main anveshnatmak khel, sanrachanaatmak khel, kaalpanik khel or niyambaddh khel shaamil hai
 Cultural variations are also seen in sports
 khel se manushya kii manovaigyanik jaruratein puri hoti hai tathaa vah manushya ko saamaajik kaushalon ke vikaas kaa bhi avasar detaa he
 According to Piaget, games also play a big role in the development of children's mental abilities
 pehle charan main baccha vastuon ke saath samvedan praapt karne va kaary sanchaalan karne kaa prayaas karata he
 In the second stage, the child starts using objects as a symbol to form imaginations
 antim charan main kaalpanik bhoomikaaon ke khelon kii tulana main baccha niyambaddh khel main sanlagn rahata he
 Games help in developing logical ability and school related skills
 vaigotski ke anusaar - jatil bhoomikaaon vaale khelon main bacchon kaa apane vyavhaar ko sangathit karne kaa behatar va surakshit avasar miltaa he jo vaastavik sthitiyon main nahin miltaa
 In this way, the game creates an area of close development for the child
 schuli sthiti kii tulana main khel ke dauraan bacchon kii ekaagratha, smriti aadi ucchtar str par kaam karti hai
 New developmental skills of the child first emerge in the game
 khel-naatakon main baccha apane aantarik vichaar ke anusaar kaam karata he or moort rup main dikhne vaali vastuon se bandhaa nahin rahata
 From here, there starts preparation for abstract thinking and thinking
 yah lekhan kii bhi taiyaari hoti he kyonki likhit rup main shabd vastu jaisaa nahin hota, uske vichaar kaa pratik hota he
 The age in which complex and elaborate roles and language are used in the game remains a major activity for the development of the child
 yah sthiti 10-11 saal tak ke bacchon main kaam rah sakati he
 Gradually, its importance starts decreasing
 shikshak bacchon ko khilne kaa paryaapt samay va saadhan dekar vishyon kaa suzav dekar, jhagadon kaa samaadhaan karke khel ko or samrudh bana sakate hai
 All children play
 yadi bachche milakar chupchaap baithe rahen or kuch bhi na karen, to kya aapako aashcharya nahin hoga
 Even if a girl is alone, she still finds something to play
 keval bachche hi nahin apitu vayask bhi khelte hai
 a three-year-old Abhinav walks in the garden, picks up water pipes in plants
 vah pipe ko jameen se thodaa upar uthaa kar ghaas par girte hue pani ko dhyaan se dekhtaa he
 Then he concentrates the last end of the pipe and puts his finger in it
 isse pani chaaron ore fawwaare kii tarah girane lagata he
 Some water falls out of the pipe and onto some plants
 kuch der baad abhinav apni anguli baahar nikaalata he or phir vaapis pipe ke munh main daal detaa he
 For the next ten minutes, he is engrossed in this action
 paanch maheene kii shashi jameen par bichhi chadar par leti hui he or apni taangon or bahon ko mila rahi he
 While doing so, a corner of the sheet falls into his hand
 shashi use munh main daalane kii koshish karti he
 Then the mother comes and removes the sheet from her mouth and gives him a toy
 shashi use bhi munh main daal leti he
 Then she presses the toy by hand
 or punah munh main daalane kii koshish karti he
 If an audience is asked what the children are doing in different situations mentioned above, perhaps the answer will be, "they are playing"
 darshakon main is baat par aam sahmati hoti he ki koun-sa kaaryaklap khel he or koun-sa nahin
 But when asked to define the game, no experts agree on any one definition of the game
 is matbhed ke baavjood bhi khel kii kuch visheshtaayen hoti hai jinke aadhaar par khel maane jane vaale gatividhiyon ko pahchaanane main madad milti he
 The first feature of the game is that the game is fun
 khel main majaa aata he
 Any activity that children enjoy is sports
 ek hi kaaryaklap kisi ke liye khel ho saktaa he or vahi duusare ke liye kaary
 For example, when children are learning to recognize coins in the classroom, they are working
 parantu jab ve sabji kharidne or bechney kaa khel khelte hai or is prakriya se swayan hi sikkon kii pahchaan karnaa sikh jate hai tab yah gatividhi khel ban jaati he
 Second, the game itself is enjoyable
 khilne se bacchon ko bahut santosh miltaa he
 When the girl repeatedly climbs the ladder and jumps from it, she does so because she enjoys it
 na to yah kriya vah apana kaushal dikhaane ke liye kar rahi he, na hi inam paane ke liye
 While doing this along with Anand, the girl's physical and functional skills are developing spontaneously when this is not her purpose
 antim baat, khel aisi kriya he jisamen balika swechha or khushi se hissaa leti he arthath khilne ke liye us par dabaav nahin daalaa jaataa he
 His contribution to the game is activated
 vayask praayah aisa maanate hai ki jab bachche khel rahe hai to us kriya ke bare main gambhir nahin hote
 This assumption is absolutely wrong
 bachche apane khel ko bahut sanjidagi se lete hai
 If someone interferes with or changes their game, the children do not like it
 bacchon ke apni khel kriyaaon ke alag niyam hote hai
 Researchers have tried to find out why children and adults spend a lot of their time in sports
 is bare main alag-alag vichaar hai
 According to some researchers, the game is an escape from the problems and realities of life and is a means of forgetting the miseries
 kuch vyakti khel ko ek vishramdaayak kriya ke rup main bhi dekhte hai
 Other people's view is that the extra energy of our body is spent by sports
 bacchon ke khel ke bare main ek mahatvapurn drushtikon yah he ki iske dwaara bachche vayaskon kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye taiyaar hote hai
 All researchers agree that children learn a lot by playing and games speed up development
 adhyayanon se yah pramanit hota he ki jin bacchon ko khilne ke avasar or prerana nahin milte ve vikaas ke har kshetra main picked jate hai
 Some evidence has been found by observing children living in orphanages and similar institutions
 is prakaar kii sabhi sansthaaen bacchon ko bhojan, aashray, shaareerik dekhbhaal, kapadaa or shiksha pradaan karti hai
 But research shows that in most cases these institutions are not able to provide proper environment for optimum development
 praayah ek hi paalankarta bahut saare bacchon kii dekhbhaal karti he or is kaaran har bachche ko paryaapt samay nahin de paati
 There is no additional talk with infants, nor does anyone caress them nor does anyone play with them
 aise maukon par kam se kam antahkriya hoti he
 In such a situation, there is a lack of mutual affection between the follower and the girl and the girl does not feel emotionally secure
 aisi kai sansthaaon main yah bhi dekha gaya ki shishuon ko jin palnon main litayaa gaya tha ve chaaron ore se kapade se dhakaa gaya tha jiske kaaran shishu paalane ke baahar kuch nahin dekh pate the
 The children had no toys except the toys hanging from the cradle, and these toys were also so far away that the children could not reach them
 bacchon kaa sara din paalane main pade-pade bitta tha or unhen kuch nayaa dekhne, sunne yaa chune ko nahin miltaa tha
 Observations found that the speed of cognitive, linguistic and physical development of these children was slower than other children
 bachche jigyaasu prakruti ke hote hai
 While playing, children get an opportunity to touch objects, observe them carefully and investigate the surrounding environment and this gives them answers to many questions arising in their mind
 khel kriyaaon ke madhyam se ve aam ghatnaon ke ghatit hone ke kaaran bhi samajhane lagate hai
 We help children learn by giving them opportunities to play at will
 khel bacchon ko khoj karne or uske dwaara swayan seekhney kaa avasar praapt hota he
 Search means finding out about events and objects themselves
 aaie, is tathy ko ham radha kaa udhaaharan lekar samajhen
 The following incident shows how the four-year-old Radha learned about the characteristics of pottery in the game itself
 radha diwaar ke sahare khadi seedhi par khel rahi thi
 While playing, he saw an earthen pot lying nearby and started playing with it
 radha usamen mitti bharti or phir khaali kar detii
 After some time he tried to put the pot on the last step of the ladder
 bartan gir kar tut gaya
 He looked briefly towards the broken pieces
 phir usne ek tukdaa uthaaya or dobaaraa seedhi par rakh diya
 The piece also collapsed and broke into many small pieces
 radha ne inamen se ek chote tukade par punah vah prayog kiya
 This time the piece did not break when dropped
 radha ne yah tukdaa uthaaya, use thodi der dhyaan se dekha or phir use phenk kar vah ghar ke andar chali gai
 Radha tried to balance the piece several times and saw it falling — this makes it clear that her curiosity was aroused
 shaayad uske mastishk main yah sawaal uthe hon,‘ ‘‘kya vah tukdaa bhi giregaa?‘‘ ‘‘agar gira to kya yah bhi tut jayega?‘‘ or isliye usne us tukade ko baar-baar seedhi par sthir rakhane kii koshish kii
 She was equally eager when the piece was not broken for the third time
 shaayad apane hi dhang se vah yah samaj gai ki bahut chota tukdaa nahin tuutata he par nishchay hi vah yah jaanane ke liye utsuk hogi
 It is possible that he would ask someone why the pieces fell and broke each time and why the last piece was not broken? It is certain that during the games he will have many such experiences which will help him to understand what happens when objects fall
 yah satya he ki agar us chote tukade ko jor se phenkaa jaae to vah bhi tut jayega or ho saktaa he ek bada baccha yah koshish karke dekhtaa
 But Radha still does not have the ability to understand this and due to this she did not throw that piece out loud
 isse yah spasht hota he ki balika vahi sikhti he jiske liye vah gyanatmak rup se taiyaar he
 As it also relates to the fact that what the girl finds inspiring depends on her cognitive skills
 khel kis prakaar vikaas main sahaayak hota he, ab iske duusare mudde par vichaar karen
 In the game, the girl has the freedom to choose the activities according to her interest, hence she chooses games which are neither very simple nor very difficult but challenging for her
 is prakaar vah un chizon ko sikhti he jinhen seekhney ke liye vah taiyaar hoti hai
 Thus learning process becomes enjoyable rather than a burden
 saath hi saath bachche khel main kriyalap dwaara sikhte hai
 Concepts can be better understood by doing so
 yadi bacchon ko kisi sankalpana ke bare main keval maukhik rup main bataaya jaae or swayan karne ko mauka nahin diya jaae to vah use itani acchhee tarah nahin samaj paaenge
 You must have experienced this thing yourself
 udhaaharan ke liye apane kisi mitra ke mukh se pakwaan banane kii vidhi sunakar utana nahin siikhaa ja saktaa jitna ki swayan pakwaan banaakar
 Similarly, if you had only told Radha that a small piece of clay will not break when it falls, then it is almost certain that Radha does not understand this and she is not even interested in this information
 yah tathy ki ‘bachche kuch karne se hi sikhte he‘ kaa arth yah nahin he ki paalankarta kii usamen koi bhoomika hi nahin he
 The need for a follower first is to help the children to explain their discovery
 shaayad radha yah samaj gai ho ki chote-tukade nahin tuutate hai par yah ham nishchit rup se nahin kah sakate
 It is only then that she will understand this on getting such other opportunities
 parantu paalankarta yah seekhney main uski madad kar sakati he
 For example, if the follower were with Radha, she could focus Radha on possibilities that Radha had not thought of
 vah yah kah sakati thi ki, ‘‘radha, kya tumne yah dekha ki baratan to tut gaya par chote tukade nahin toote?‘‘ The second follower may broaden the child's search
 vah radha se nae prayog karne ko kah sakati thi jaise ki, ‘‘radha, ab is chote tukade ko mulaayam sataha par phenko jaise ghaas, ret yaa pani or dekho ki kya hota he
 "this would have led to other discoveries, such as a piece of soil not breaking in the grass, etc
" iske saath-saath paalankarta ko chahie ki bacchon ko khoj ke liye avasar pradaan kare
 Children learn new when they are allowed to play with the game material and encouraged to do something themselves
 ant main, paalankarta ko sadaiv is baat kii pratiksha nahin kerani chahie ki bachche swayan kuch bhi karen
 He should organize such situations for children through which children can learn new
 jab paalankarta aisa kar rahi ho to use bacchon kii ruchi or sangyanatmak vikaas ke str ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 Take for example water sports
 bacchon ko pani se bharaa bartan or kuch alag-alag tarah kii vastuen -jisamen se kuch pani main tirenge or kuch doobane vaali hon, dijie
 When children put these things in water, they will see that some like leaves, twigs and pieces of paper float on top of water while spoons, stones etc
 are immersed in water
 tatpashchaat aap bacchon se is vishay par charchaa kar sakate hai ki kyon kuch vastuen dub jaati hai or kuch kyon tairti rahati hai
 In this way, the follower can help the children to learn about colors, shapes, numbers, seasons, different types of sparrows and plants etc
 through the game
 khel dwaara bachche choti, lambii or thigani, halaki or baari jaisi sankalpanaaon se bhi parichit hote hai
 Just as the follower has to organize activities for cognitive development, in order to encourage development in other areas, the follower should also organize activities according to development
 khel main bachche kalpana dwaara alag-alag bhoomikaaye nibhaate hai
 In doing so, his intelligence and behavior are according to the person he is playing
 is kaaran ve un vyaktiyon ke vichaar or bhaawanaaon ko bhi pradarshit karte hai
 For example, the girl becomes the mother of the girl Gideya and tells the doll that she will not get the toffee as it is harmful for her
 shaayad usne aisa isliye kaha kyonki jab balika ne dekha-‘khel main maan kii nakal karke uchit vyavhaar sikh rahi he
 Drama is an integral part of children's play
 khel main balika vaastaviktaa se cat or bahut kuch srujanaatmak karti he
 a broken plate becomes the table for a three-year-old girl and a spacecraft for a ten-year-old boy
 maachis ke dibbon kii pankti railgadee ban jaati he or is railgadee se khelte hue bachche jangal se guzarane nadi paar karne or dakaiton se ladane kaa naatak karte hai
 You will be surprised to see that the rail is running on the road and not on the track
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki khel yatharth hi darshaae
 The game develops imaginations and helps children cope with daily situations
 shaareerik or kriyaatmak kaushalon kaa vikaas abhyaas karne par nirbhar karata he
 Play is an action that provides children with ample practice opportunities
 nimnlikhit ghatana is baat ko spasht karti he- When a mother puts a tingle in front of a four-month-old baby
 shishu kaa dhyaan jhunjhuna kii taraf aakarshith hota he
 And he tries to reach it by turning from his back to his stomach
 yah karne ke liye mansapeshiyon kaa samanvay jaruri he
 In an effort to reach the tingling again and again, the baby gets an opportunity to eat mud and slowly he does it easily
 bachche jab eenton kii ek pankti par chalane kii koshish karte hai, diwaar phandate hai, seedhi chadhate hai, jhulon main latakate hai, daudane ke khel khelte hai, cycle kii sawari karte hai to unki bahut mansapeshiyon kaa samanvay badhata he
 In sports, small muscles of children develop by digging pits in the ground, making flower necklaces, drawing and coloring them
 bachche khel-khel main bolnaa kaise sikhte hai? yah to spasht he ki bhashaa jaanane ke liye unka bhashaa ko sun paanaa or bol paanaa aavashyak he
 In humorous actions with the follower, the child has many opportunities to listen to the language which motivates her to speak
 jab balika kareeb nau maheene kii hoti he tab vah ‘‘ga ga ga‘‘, ‘‘be be be‘‘, ‘‘maa maa maa‘‘, ‘‘mam mam‘‘, jaise kai swar nikaalati he
 Some of these are the introduction of the language of adults
 is antah kriya ke dauraan balika vibhinn dhvaniyon ke bich bolnaa sikhti he
 This ability later helps her distinguish words like "abba" and "amma" and she recognizes them as separate words
 bachche chaukor, gol, sidhi or vakr rekha jaisi vibhinn akritiyon ko bhi samajhane lagate hai jo baad main unhen bhinn aksharon ko pahchaanane main madad karte hai
 Children playing see that the black and red circle or the small and big circle are all circular
 isse unhen samajhane main madad milegi ki ‘k‘ akshar ‘k‘ hi rahata he chahen vah shabd ke shuru main ho yaa ant main
 In the game she learns the meaning of concepts such as before and after, left and right, up and down, which are essential for learning to write and read
 aapane yah dekha ki khel kriyaatmak vikaas main sahaayak hote hai jo ki likhnaa seekhney ke liye aavashyak hota he
 Children readily learn what they are interested in
 yah baat likhnaa or padhanaa seekhney ke liye bhi satya he
 Listening to stories will inculcate in children the desire to read them and will inspire them to read and write
 agar balika ko likhnaa nahin aata or paalankarta us par likhane ke liye dabaav daalati he to sambhavtah likhnaa seekhney kii prakriya ko yadi khel bana diya jaae jisamen balika jameen par likhe hue ‘k‘ par chote-chote pathar rakhe, uski ruparekha par chale yaa ‘k‘ akshar ke binduon ko jod kar ‘k‘ likhe to vah dhire-dhire ‘k‘ kii ruparekha se parichit ho jaaegi
 In this way she will also have fun and she will learn to write without pressure
 jab maan shishu ko nahalaati he, kapade pahanaati he, sulaati he or uski anya sabhi aavashyaktaaon kaa dhyaan rakhti he to in antah kriyaaon ke dauraan balika maan ko pahchaanane lagati he
 His attachment to his mother also increases
 aap jaanate hai ki yah shishu kaa pehla saamaajik sambandh he, jiskaa uske bhavi sambandhon par bhi gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 In the early years of life, the girl plays with her hands and feet and with the surrounding objects
 isse shishu ko yah pataa chalata he ki uskaa sharir aasapaas kii vastuon se alag he
 Through such experiences he develops his perception of himself
 khel ke dauraan balika yah samajhati he ki logon or vastuon par kya prabhaav pad saktaa he
 She begins to understand that mother will come to her when she cries, when she laughed, mother will also laugh and pick her up in her lap
 jab vah dibbe ko dhakka detii he to vah usase dur ho jaataa he
 This lets the child know how his activities affect the environment
 parivesh ko jaanane or vibhinn sthitiyon se jujhane se balika kaa aatmavishvaas badhata he or use swaavlambee hone kaa ahsaas hota he
 As the girl grows up she plays with other children
 unke saath khelte hue aapas main chijen baantna, niyamon kaa paalan karnaa, apni baari kii pratiksha karnaa sikhti he
 In this way she also learns to take into account other people's viewpoints and value them
 khelte samay bachche aksar vayaskon kii nakal karte hai
 In this way learn appropriate behaviors and the roles that they must play when they grow up
 khelte hue paraspar kriya main ve vibhinn prakaar ke kaaryon, tyohaaron, dharanaon ke bare main jaankaree praapt karte hai
 Sports activities provide children with an opportunity to express joy, gaiety, anger, fear and sorrow
 khel main kuch bhi manachaaha karne kii chhot hoti he basharte ki usase kisi ko haani na pahunche
 The game gives an opportunity to express emotions and emotions that cannot be expressed in other situations
 udhaahrantah khel main pita kii bhoomika kaa abhinay karte hue balika duusare bachche ko apni ajna kaa paalan karne ke liye kah sakati hai
 He may not do this in other situations
 ladaai kaa drishy khelte samay vah jor se chilla sakati he, vastuen idhar-udhar patake sakati he jisaki anumati use aamtaur par nahin milti
 Four-year-old Raza often scolded his parents for breaking even the smallest rule
 choti-se-choti galati ke liye use pita se thappad khaanaa padataa tha
 Father used to beat him with a waist belt
 yah baccha praayah kursi par baith kar kalpana karata ki kursi ghoda he or kursi ko peti se maarthe hue kahata ‘‘tej chalo, or bhi tej‘‘
 It is clear that the child's heart is filled with anger and bitterness towards his father, but he cannot express these feelings in real terms to his father
 yah kaalpanik khel-sthiti use apane gusse or bhaawanaaon ko vyakt karne kaa mauka detii he
 In this way latent emotions emerge from the game
 uparyukt udaahranon main aapane dekha ki bacchon ke khel main unki bhavanaayen or manodashaayen spasht rup se jhalkati hai
 That is why sports are treatment or therapy for children who do not show normal emotional response according to the situation
 khel bacchon ke vikaas main madad karke unhen bhavishya kii bhoomikaaon ke liye taiyaar karte hai
 The concepts learned in sports help in reading and writing skills and ability to participate in group sports and later in school adjustment
 atah khel aupchaarikta shiksha kii taiyaari main sahaayak hota he
 The game also nurtures the mindset of asking questions and exploring
 jaise-jaise bachche nai chijen sikhte hai or unamem nipunata praapt karte hai vah apane bare main aashwast hote hai
 This growing self-confidence prepares them to accept challenges
 bacchon kii khel kriyaaon ko kai prakaar se vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Some classifications are made keeping in mind the location of the game, some based on the theme of the game's actions and others based on the game's actions
 in kriyaaon ke suvidhanusaar bhinn-bhinn vargeekaran kiye gaye hai
 Virtually all classifications are interrelated to some degree
 paalankarta lakshyon or uddeshyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kai khel kriyaayein yojit karte hai
 In these actions, the child has to follow the instructions of the follower
 uske paas khel kriya ko badalane kii adhik swatantrata nahin hoti
 The girl is free to play in her own way or has to follow the rules laid down by the follower - on the basis of this the game is classified into free and structural games
 udhaahrantah jab balika mitti ke saath kisi vayask ke hastkshep / nirdesan ke bina hi khel rahi ho tab ise mukt khel kehete hai
 On the other hand, to explain the concept of shape, the game is called structured when the follower instructs the girl, "let's go out and make clay bowls and plates"
 is charchaa kaa yah arth nahin he ki mukt khel se bachche kuch nahin sikhte
 All kinds of games encourage children to learn
 antar keval yah he ki sanrachit khel kriya se jis uplabdhi kii aashaa hoti he vah paalankarta dwaara pehle se nirdhaarit hoti he
 Both types of games are mandatory for children
 mukt khel jigyaasa or pahal ko banaaye rakhata he
 And encourages children to explore
 sanrachanaatmak khel main paalankarta balika kaa dhyaan kuch vishesh pahaluon kii ore aakarshith kar sakati he jiske bare main usne sochaa na ho
 Thus, structural play helps in achieving specific goals
 paalankarta ko yah dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he ki donon hi prakaar kii khel kriyaaon main bacchon ko anand aae
 As is clear from the name, games played in the open field are called outdoor games and home games are called indoor games
 ghar ke baahar khele jane vaale khelon main kriyaaon ke avasar milte hai kyon k yahan sthaan adhik va baadhaayen kam hoti han
 Space is limited for games played indoors and the freedom of activities is relatively low
 vaise to bahari va bhitari khelon main bhinnata bahut kam hoti he
 Many indoor games can be played outside, and outdoor games can also be played inside with little change
 kabhi-kabhi bhitari khel kriya ko baahar karne se neerasata dur hoti he or bachche ke liye vahi kriya nai or ruchikar ban jaati he
 When the girl herself plays alone, it is called a personal game
 jab vah do yaa adhik bacchon ke saath khelti he to vah samuhik khel kehalaata he
 In order to play in a group it is necessary that the child keeps in mind the views of others and follows the rules of the game
 jaisaa ki aap pard chuke hai ye yogyataayen umr ke saath viksit hoti hai
 By the age of three to four, children mostly play alone
 anya bacchon ke saath ve keval thode samay ke liye paraspar mil kar khelte hai
 As children get older they learn to play with others and then most of their playing time is spent playing in groups
 parantu samay-samay par bade bachche bhi akele khelnaa pasand karte hai
 While playing in groups increases social skills, personal play gives children time to play with the items they find most interesting
 donon hi khel uske kaushalon ke vikaas main sahaayak hote hai
 Many times adults get annoyed and say, "why can't children sit in one place?" Why do people run around? ”children like to run, jump and jump games, ie games that require more energy
 aisi khel kriyaayein ojasvi / sakriy khl kriyaayein kehalaati hai
 Games that do not require much physical activity such as writing with chalk on the ground, drawing, making toys out of clay and making towers with stones, provide comfort to the children
 aise khel jinamein adhik urja vyay nahin hoti shant khel kehalaate hai
 In the infancy, children's play is to touch, smell, taste and explore the surroundings
 in kriyaaon main indriyaan sanlagn hoti hai or mansapeshiyon ke samanvay kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Hence these are called sensory-functional games
 shaishavkaal ke ant tak bachche naatakeey khel main bhaag lene lagate hai
 In this type of play, children imagine that there is a tin box house or wooden block airplane
 is prakaar ek vastu kaa upyog uske vaastavik rup se hatakar hota he
 Children pretend to be fruitful, sometimes teachers and sometimes florists, playing the role of other people
 is prakaar khel main vastuon or logon ko pratikatmak rup main upyog karne kii gyanatmak yogyata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Such games are called symbolic games and are possible only as a result of mental development in pre-school years
 samvedi-kriyaatmak khel se pratikatmak khel tak pahunchnaa bacchon ke chintan main badhati hui jatilta par aadhaarit hai
 This classification of games is interrelated
 mukt khel khule main yaa bheetar khelaa ja saktaa he
 Collective play can be active or quiet
 mahatv is baat ko diya janaa chahie ki bachche ko har prakaar ke khel khilne kaa mauka mili kyonki har khel kaa apana mahatv he
 How children play games, how they use sports materials, what is the subject matter of their games and how much time they spend in games are all influenced by many factors
 bachche kis prakaar ke khel chunate hai, yah unki umr se prabhavit hota he
 For a six-month-old baby, it is a game to pick up and observe objects lying around
 ek chaar varshiya balak ko tipaahiya cycle chalaanaa or ret se vastuen bananaa anandadaayak lagata he
 An eight-year-old boy enjoys cycling two-wheelers, climbing trees and playing stopups
 bacchon dwaara khel kriya kaa chunaav unke kaushalon or yogyataon se bhi nirdhaarit hota he
 The sports that the four and eight-year-old boys chose in the above examples were influenced by their physical skills
 jaise-jaise bachche bade hote hai unki saamaajik kshamtaaon main bhi vruddhi hoti he
 Due to which there is a qualitative change in their interaction and thus their type of game is also affected
 jin khelon main aapasi sahyog, team main khelnaa or niyamon kaa paalan karnaa aavashyak he ve khel teen varshiya baalkon ke samarthy se baahar hai parantu aath varshiya baalkon ke liye aise khelnaa sambhav he
 The theme of children's play also varies with age
 chah varshiya balika or teen varshiya balika ke gudiya se khilne main bhinnata hogi
 The six-year-old girl extensively organizes the game - she prepares the doll for school, teaches it, discusses her progress with parents and even takes her out to play, etc
 
 teen varshiya balika kaa gudiya se khel isse kahin adhik saral hoga
 The amount of time a girl spends in a particular sports activity is determined by her age
 jaisaa ki aap jaanate hai balika jitani choti hogi utani hi kam avadhi tak vah ek khel kriya main dhyaan laga paaegi
 For this reason, there will be frequent changes in his actions
 haalanki bacchon kii umr unke khel ko prabhavit karne main ek nishchit bhoomika nibhaati he tathaapi hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chaiye ki khel main vaiyaktik bhinnataayen or abhiruchiyaan bhi mahatvapurn hai
 It is possible that a five-year-old girl spends less time in group sports than other children her age
 agar aap shishuon ke khel kaa avlokan karen to usamen samanta paaenge
 Gender in childhood does not affect sports
 unka khel apane or aasapaas kii vastuon kii khojbin se sambandhit hota he
 But as children get older, the interests of boys and girls start to vary
 ye bhinnata umr ke saath badhati jaati he
 Girls like to wear their mother's clothes, play with dolls, pretend to cook, sew and stapu
 ladke apane pita ke kapade pahananaa pasand karte hai, kursi par baith kar akhbaar padhane kaa naatak karte hai, baiylgaadee chalaate hai, khet jotate hai or banduukon se khelte hai kai adhyayanon main ladke or ladakiyon ke khel kii tulana kii gai he
 They show that boys' games are more subjected to harassment and harassment than girls and they are more competitive than girls
 ladkiyaan, ladakon kii apeksha khel main adhik sahyog dikhaati hai
 Boys play more games
 iske kya kaaran ho sakate hai? One reason may be physical differences in boys and girls
 ek baccha kitni shaareerik kriya kar saktaa he, yah uski sharir vritti se prabhavit hota he
 This has an impact on children's game selection and that is why boys choose more active sports
 parantu bacchon kii adhikansh khel abhiruchiyon kaa kaaran sharir vritti na hokar saamaajik apekshaayen or roodhiyaan hai
 People's expectations from children are influenced by their gender
 isi kaa prabhaav unke khel chayan par padataa he
 Let us understand this with an example
 aapane aksar yah dekha he ki hoga ki ek ladkaa, ladki kii apeksha ped par adhik aasaani se chadh jaataa he
 It is not that the girl does not have the ability to climb the tree
 parantu sambhav he ki jab ladki pehali baar ped par chadhane lagi ho to uski maan ne usase kaha ho, ‘‘yah kya ladakon vaale kaam kar rahi ho, neeche utaro
 "on the other hand, the boy must have been applauded for this effort, so the boy learns to climb the tree more efficiently than the girl
 ghar par dainik kaaryon main ladakiyon se chote bhai-bahanon kii dekhbhaal or ghar ke kaam main madad kii apeksha kii jaati he
 Therefore, the same conditions are reflected in his games
 ladke pita kii madad karte hai, baahar kaa kaam karte hai or aisi sthitiyon kii jhalak unke khel main bhi dikhaai detii he
 Nowadays, especially in cities, girls can be seen in the role of doctors and police in the game as women are now adopting these occupations
 mata-pita bhinn-bhinn khel saadhan dekar bhi ladakon or ladakiyon kii abhiruchiyon ko protsaahit karte hai ladakiyon ko gudiya bartan or anya isi prakaar ke khilone die jate hai
 Boys are given toys like guns and cars
 chaar varshiya hari ko jab uski bahan ne gudiya se khilne ke liye bulaayaa tab usne yah kehete hue spasht rup se manaa kar diya, ‘‘main ladakiyon vaale khel nahin kheltaa
 "but when he thinks no one is watching him, he plays with dolls
" isse spasht he ki hari ko gudiyon se khelnaa acha lagata he
 His direct disinterest in the sport of dolls is not innate
 samskruti jivan-style par asar daalati he
 Shishupalan traditions are also influenced by culture
 inhen kuch paramparaon kii ham yahan charchaa karenge
 Let us now read about some such traditions
 hamaare desh ke kai bhaagon main shishuon kii tel se maalish karnaa ek puraani pratha he
 The mother usually hums the song, talks and plays with the child
 bharat ke sabhi bhaagon main is prakaar ke kai maan or shishu ke khel hai
 This experience of the infant will be very different from that of the infant living in another culture where such interactions do not occur
 bacchon kii vayask jivan ke bare main kalpana unke khel main jhalkati he
 They often get a glimpse of what they want to become when they become adults, and these roles are determined by culture
 khel unke samaaj ke paaramparik tyohaaron or ritiyon ko bhi pradarshit karata he
 All cultures have a rich tradition of toys
 jab sindhu ghati jaisi pracheen sabhyataaon kii khudaai hui to vahaan bhi khilone paae gaye
 Studies show that in our country there is a lot of variation in the sports content of different regions
 urisa ke sundar mukhute or kathputliyaan mashhoor hai
 Wooden toys are made at Chennapatna in Karnataka and Konda Palli in Andhra Pradesh, along with folk toys in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, as well as modern toys
 duusari ore manipur or tripura main vyavsaayik khilone bahut hi kam milte hai
 Residents here make toys for their children at home
 hamaare desh ke adhikansh bhaagon main tyohaaron ke samay bahut se lok khilone bazaaron main milte hai
 These toys have the same educational value as commercially made toys
 nimna saamaajik varg main bacchon kaa adhikansh samay mata-pita ke kaam main sahaayta karte hue bitta he
 Being busy with tasks, they get very little time to play
 apane kaam ke dauraan hi ve khilne kaa samay nikaalte hai
 Children from middle and upper social classes have more time for sports as their contribution to income-producing activities is not mandatory
 parantu in vargon ke kuch pariwaron main mata-pita padhai par bahut jor dete hai or is kaaran bacchon ke khilne kaa samay kam kar dete hai
 Children love to collect stones, bottle caps, empty cans etc
 agar aap ek bachche kii jeb khaali karen to aisa sangrah paanaa ascharyajanak baat nahin he
 Many times children keep their collected stones, oysters and other items of choice in one corner of the house
 mahangi, saji hui gudiya or samudr tat se jamaa kii gai seepi-prayek balak ko, chaahe vah amir ho yaa garib ye donon hi vastuen samaan rup se aakarshith karti hai jo bachche acchhee aarthik sthiti vaale pariwaron ke hote hai ve bazaar main milane vaale khilone kharid sakate hai
 When the ability to buy ready made toys is not in the family, then old tires, wheels, empty boxes, match boxes, old newspapers are used for playing
 bacchon ko aisi sthiti main adhik srujanaatmak hone kii aavashyaktaa hoti he taaki ve swayan khel saamagree bana saken
 Social class also determines how much and how much space children will get to play
 jo bachche bade makaanon main rahete hai, jahaan baag-bageeche hote hai, ve us jagah ko khilne ke liye upyog main laa sakate hai
 Children who live in one-room houses do not have to find their place to play on the streets and streets
 aapane padhaa tha ki nimna varg ke parivaar ke sabhi bade sadsy aay utpaadak gatividhiyon main sanlagn hote hai
 Parents have very little time to participate and guide children in sports
 madhyam or ucch varg ke mata-pita bacchon ke saath sambhawatah adhik samay vyateet kar pate hai
 They are usually more educated and may be more aware of the importance of sports in children's development, so they will give adequate opportunities for children to play
 parantu yah jaruri nahin he ki shiksha se hi aisi abhivritti bane jo bacchon kii aavashyaktaaon ke prati samvedansheel hon
 Uneducated parents can also be sensitive to the needs of children and give them many varied experiences of play
 shahar kii bheedbhad main khilne ke liye khuli jagah kam hi mil paati he
 Even then children find a place to play
 aapane unhen tang galiyon main, sadakon par or ghar kii chhaton par khelte hue dekha hoga
 There is less opportunity to see plants in cities, there is more open space for playing in rural and public areas and children are more close to nature
 mudrit jan sampark madhyam, jaise ki patrikas or kitaaben or shravy-drushya madhyam, jaise ki radio or televijan kaa bacchon ke khel par atyadhik prabhaav padataa he
 Many illustrated books and magazines are available for children and various programs are also broadcast for them especially on radio and television
 bachche padhi hui kahaniyon kaa utsukata se abhinay karte hai, radio par suni dhun gaate hai or utsaah se televijan ke kaarykram ko dekh paatro kii nakal karte hai
 Public relations media often support conservative conceptions of society and these perceptions are reflected in children's play
 jansampark madhyam duniya ko bacchon ke kareeb laate hai or unki jaankaree yadi kisi vayask ke nirdesan main praapt ho to bahut laabhadaayak ho sakati he
 There is variation in the types of inspiration that printed and audio-visual media provide to children
 kitaaben ek aisa madhyam hai jinako swayan padhakar hi kuch pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Children have an active role in this type of learning process and it promotes the spirit and curiosity of investigation
 duusari ore televijan or radio ke kaaryakramon ko bachche adhiktar baithe-baithe hi sunate or dekhte hai
 Usually these programs do not give them a chance to search but only tell what needs to be known
 isi kaaran shravy-drushya madhyam main vayaskon kaa nirdesan anivaary ho jaataa he
 The experiences that children experience in families and neighborhoods significantly affect the level of play
 nimnlikhit do udhaaharan is baat ko chitrit karte hai
 In a family of a lower social class, the parents leave for work in the morning and return home in the evening
 kaam par jane ke purv maan shishu kii maalish karti he or us samay usase khelti or baatcheet karti he
 In the evening when both parents return, the father plays with the child and the mother does household chores
 duusari sthiti main, ek shikshit maan, jo amir parivaar kii he, apni bacchee ko adhiktar paalane main khilaunon ke paas lite rakhti he
 Her attention is only towards the physical care of the child and she plays very little to him
 in do sthitiyon main yah sambhav he ki pehle parivaar kii balika kaa bachapan adhik acha beetegaa kyonki use seekhney ke kai maukey milte hai or vah surakshit mahasoos karti he
 Parents and parents who understand the importance of sports can give children an environment in which sports can be promoted no matter their social class, education level or circumstances
 khel ke bare main aam dharna yah he ki yah kaam kaa vilom he
 Sports is a situation in which people are not doing any useful or specific work
 khel ke bare main ek soch yah bhi he ki yah anandadaayak, mukt or anayas hota he
 This approach negates the importance of sports in the development of young children
 kai saalon se kai manovaigyanik siddhantkaar bachche ke vikaas main khel ke mahatv par jor dene lage hai
 He has emphasized many aspects of the game and explained how the game affects psychological processes
 arikson or anna frid ke anusaar khel apurna rah gayi ichchhaaon kaa sthanapann or ateet kii ghaatak ghatnaon se mukti or punerjeevan kaa ek rasta he
 The psychoanalytic method emphasizes the socially emotional aspects of sport
 khel ke dwaara baccha mata-pita ke saath apane maansik dvandvon or vivekahin, bhayon kaa samaadhaan karata he
 a child overcomes the fear of darkness by playing demon-monster, a child punishes his doll for a perceived violation of a rule in the same way as a parent punishes him
 arikson kii drushti main priskool charan ke dauraan khel ek bachche ke liye khoj, pahal or swatantraaa kaa rasta he
 Psychologically, sports are a way of guiding aggression through medium in a depressive experience
 yah ateet ke liye ek pratikriya or ateet kii ghatnaon kii ore lautne kii prakriya kaa ek tantra bhi he
 Partell and other theorists see sports as a form of social exchange that enhances and mirrors the child's developing ability to engage in collaborative tasks with classmates
 khel ke aarambhik charnon main sahpaathiyon ke saath aadan-pradaan lagbhag nahin yaa bahut thodaa hota he or us samay saamaajik kaushalon ke prayog main asamarthta bhi dikhti he
 The ability to see from one side to another, co-ordination in different roles, conversations about the game's content and ability to resolve disputes seems to be developing
 khel main kalpit or naatakeey sthitiyaan saamanytah saamaajik aadan-pradaan kii adhik paripakv vidhiyaan maani jaati hai
 Some researchers have also looked at sports from a social point of view
 dhakka-mukki ke antargat sab tarah ke kushti or ‘pakado to jane‘ koti ke khel shaamil kiye ja sakate hai
 Like social games, push-free games also have roles
 piyaaje ke anusaar bachche kii viksit hoti hui maansik kshamtaaon main khel ek badi bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Piagas count several stages of game development
 pehla charan, jise ve abhyaas yaa kaaryaatmak khel kehete hai, samvedan-prerit kriya ke daur kaa ek lakshan he
 In functional play, the child repeats the familiar methods of using objects
 udhaaharan ke liye, khaali pyaale se peetaa he, haathon ke istemaal se baalo main kanghee karne kaa naatak karata he
 The second stage is a symbolic game that emerges in the pre-operative / pre-operative phase
 yah maansik pratikon ke istemaal kaa daur he
 Things symbolize something different from itself
 pratikatmak khel main ek lakdi ke gutke ko telephone, naav, kuÿ, kelaa yaa hawaizhaj banaaya ja saktaa he
 Piaget has made a difference in structural and dramatic play
 sanrachanaatmak khel main duusari vastuon ko banane yaa rachane ke liye thos vastuon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example cars and toned toys, wooden blocks can be used to build a city
 naatakeey khel main bachche shabdon or mudraon ke dwaara kalpit sthitiyaan or bhoomikaayen gadhate hai
 They create roles and decide which child will play which role and visualize the theme and direction of its development for a hypothetical scene
 naatakeey khel kaa ubhaar praayah sanrachanaatmak khel ke kuch baahar sataha par aata he
 Piagas saw the play of this era's imagery as a reflection of the child's self-centered thought
 piyaaje ke anusaar saat varsh kii aayu ke aasapaas thos-kriyaatmak daur ke aarambh main yah samaapt ho jaataa he
 In the last phase, it has been said that the game will be converted into a regulated game yahan hindi main ‘khel‘ or ‘krida‘ main vahi bhed kiya ja rahaa he
 a game is a structured and structured game, which turns into a strong action round
 is daur kii visheshta yah he ki saamaajik aadan-pradaan ko aarambh karne, niyantrit karne or jari rakhane tathaa samaapt karne ke liye bahya rup se pratyaksh niyamon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Many contemporary researchers have expanded Piaget's assumptions
 smallenski or shefatya ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki khel ke vikaas kaa sidhaa sahasambandh bhashaa ke vikaas, samasya-samaadhaan or tarksangat ganitiya chintan ke vikaas ke saath judata he
 But Smalenski and Shephatya disagree with this concept of Piaget
 khel samvedanprerit kriya ke charan se lekar purvakriyaatmak or thos kriyaatmak charan kii ore sahaj pragati kaa parinaam he
 He believes that the development of the game depends on the social context and the guidance of the elders
 unka yah vichaar bhi he ki kuch bacchon ke liye khelon kaa prashikshan anivaary he
 They have proved through their research that adults can successfully raise the level of children's play
 khel ke bade hue str kaa sakaaratmak prabhaav bachche ke anya sangyanatmak kaushalon par bhi hota he
 Vygotsky believed that sports promote cognitive, emotional and social development
 upar charchit anya siddhantakaaron ke vipareet vikaas main khel ke mahatv ke bare main vaigotski kaa drushtikon adhik samanvayakaari tha
 For Vygotsky, play is a mental tool to give children the ability to control their behavior
 khel main jo kalpit sthitiyaan khadi kii jaati hai, ve bachche ke vyavhaar ko ek khaas tarah se niyantrit karne vaali or disha dene vaali pratham baadhaayen hai
 Organizes sports behavior
 udhaaharan ke liye khel main baccha svachhnd vyavhaar nahin karata, ‘‘mummy-mummy’ yaa ‘driver-driver' ke khel main vah maan yaa trek-driver hone kaa bahaanaa karata he
 In every hypothetical situation, roles and rules are definite rules that naturally come to the surface
 bhoomikaayen charitron kii hoti hai jinako bachche khelte hai jaise samudri daaku kii yaa shikshak kii bhoomika
 Roles and rules also change as the theme of the imaginary situation changes
 udhaaharan ke liye ‘kiraane kii dukaan’ kaa, khel ke niyam, ‘sher-sher’ khelte bacchon kii bhoomikaaon or khel ke niyamon se bhinn honge
 The rules of the game are initially disguised within the game, later they come to the surface and are decided among the children
 atah khel, main ek pratyaksh kalpit sthiti or kuch prachhann niyam shaamil hote hai
 The hypothetical situation is a situation created by children that pretends to be true
 kalpit hote hue bhi dusron ke liye pratyaksh ho jaati he kyonki bachche uske lakshan prakat kar dete hai
 They say, 'suppose there is a chair here and a table there
 maan lo ki hamaari kaksha main chah bachche hai or ham shikshak hai
 They also reveal the imagined position of their game by gestures and voices
 jaise petol-pump-stesan se nikalate hue ek tank ko prakat karne ke liye ‘‘ghurrarrarr ghurrarrarr’’ kii awaz yaa ek kalpit ghode kii lagaam khinchate hue bachche kaa "chinhinhinhin kaa shor
 "but rules are considered elusive because they cannot be seen easily, they can only be inferred by behavior
 niyam kisi vishesh bhoomika ke saath jude hue vyavhaar ke namoonay ke rup main abhivyakt hote hai khel kii kalpit sthiti main har bhoomika bachche ke vyavhaar par apane niyam lagu kar detii he
 From the western perspective, these ideas about sports are extraordinary because traditionally we have considered sports as completely free and uninterrupted
 lekin vaigotski kaa kahana he ki khel main bachche keval manamaana vyavhaar nahin karte
 In the game of 'mummy-mummy' and in the game of 'teacher-teacher', children differentiate
 har bhoomika ke anusaar bhinn mudraaen, bhinn veshbhusha, yahaan tak ki bhashaa bhi bhinn hoti he
 They are not aware of these differences in the early stages of the game, but most children as young as four years of age show that they are very sensitive to mistakes in the maintenance of a role and often correct each other, mummy She carries a briefcase, "if you are a teacher, children have to sit," "teacher reads the book like this"
 bachche mazaaq kii tarah bhoomika ke niyamon kaa ulanghan bhi karte hai
 Toby, three, climbs into a high chair and says, "now I'm Daddy
" ’’ phir vah tahaakaa laga kar hansata or kahata he, "daddy ab apni unchi kursi par baith nahin sakate
 " pashchim main haal ke anusandhanon kaa jo saransh smallenski or shefatya ne diya he uske sanket ke anusaar naatakeey khel ke vikaas se sangyanatmak or saamaajik vikaas ke alaava skool sambadh kaushalon ko bhi laabh pahunchataa he
 These include, for example, verbal expression, word processing, comprehension, duration of attention, imaginativeness, concentration, charge control, curiosity, problem-solving tips, collaboration, empathy, and collective participation
 vaigotskivaadiyon ne un kriyaatantron kii jaanch kii he jinke dwaara khel vikaas ko prabhavit karata hai
 For example, Manuel and Istomina have observed that children have higher mental skills during play than other learning activities
 vaigotski ne ise nikat vikaas kshetra ke ucchtar str kii tarah pahachaanaa he
 Manuel k found that children's self-control is at a higher level during play than the rest
 ek ladke ko jab khel main nigaraanee rakhane kaa kaam diya gaya to vah jitani der tak dhyaan ko ekagra rakhte hue apni jagah par tikaa rahaa utani der tak vah shikshak dwaara bataae kaam par dhyaan nahin rakh paata
 Istomina compared how many things children could remember when playing a 'grocery store' game, compared to an equivalent situation in the laboratory
 bacchon ko shabdon kii ek suchi yaad karne ke liye di gayi thi
 In the dramatic situation of the game, the children were given this list while playing the game of the grocery store, and in the examination conditions in the laboratory, Manuel Kay found that in the case of the dramatic game, the children remembered a greater number of things
 vaigotski ke anusaar khel vikaas ko teen tareeke se prabhavit karata he : According to Vygotsky, the game also creates a near-development zone for the child
 khel main baccha hameshaa apni aayu se adhik or apane dainik vyavhaar ke str se upar uthakar bartaav karata he, maano khel ke dauraan vah khud apane kad se haath bhar unchaa ho gaya ho
 All the trends of development within the game, as if the terror is present in the focus of the glass, in a substantial way; As if the child is ready to jump above his normal level
 khel or vikaas ke sambandh kii tulana shiksha or vikaas ke sambandh se kii ja sakati he
 The game is a source of development and creates innovation
 khel kii keval vishaywastu hi nikat vikaas kshetra ko paribhaashit nahin karti he
 The mental process that a child engages in to play constitutes the input
 baccha nikat vikaas kshetra ke ucchtar str par kaam kar sake iske liye kalpit sthitiyon se praapt bhoomikaayen, niyam tathaa prerana sahaayak siddh hote hai
 If we compare the behavior of the child in situations outside of sports and games, we will see higher and lower levels of the near development area
 khel ke baahar yaa vaastavik jivan kii sthiti main, ek general store main lui ek toffee chahta he
 His mother refuses
 vah rone lagata he
 He is not able to control his behavior
 toffee kii chaah ke liye uski pratikriya swatahchalit he
 He even says, he is not stopping crying
 khel main vah apane vyavhaar ko niyantrit kar saktaa he kyonki vah parivaar kii kalpit sthiti ko niyantrit kar saktaa he
 He can pretend to go to the general store and not cry
 vah rone or rulaai roak lene kaa naatak kar saktaa he
 The drama may give him an opportunity to work at such a higher level than the actual situation
 udhaaharan ke liye paanch saal kii jesica apni kaksha main samooh ke saath daayre main baithne ke samay dikkat mahasoos karti he
 She keeps fighting over other children and talking to the accompanying child
 shikshak ke shabdic ishaaron or madad ke baavjood vah teen minute se adhik sidhi baith hi nahin sakati
 On the contrary, when she is playing school-to-school with her friends, she stays stationary for long periods of time in the practice of sitting in the circle
 acchhee chaatra hone kaa naatak karte samay vah dhyaan ko ekagra karke dilchaspee lene kaa naatak das minute tak kar sakati he
 Thus the game gives her roles, rules and status that make it possible for her to concentrate and get interested at a higher level, as she would not have done without this support
 yadi bachche ko khel kaa anubhav nahin miltaa to hamaare vichaar se uske sangyanatmak, bhavatmak tathaa saamaajik vikaas ko haani pahonchegi
 Vygotsky's disciples Leontyev and Alkoninin refined their idea that the game was a major activity
 unka kahana he ki teen se chah varsh ke bacchon ke vikaas ke liye khel ek atyant mahatvapurn gatividhi he
 During this period children benefit from various activities, but Leontyev and Alconin believed that the role of sports is unique to this age which no other activity can take
 ‘‘ek aatshi shishe ke focus main ’’ kehane se vaigotski kaa taatpary tha ki adhigam kii tathaa anya gatividhiyon kii apeksha khel main nai vikasman dakshataayen pehle prakat hoti hai
 Therefore, at the age of four, academic activities such as recognition of characters are not as suitable as games for predicting the future prospects of a child
 chaar saal ke bachche ke khel main ham ek ucchtar str par uski dhyaan, pratikan or samasya ke samaadhaan kii kshamtaaon kaa nirikshan kar sakate hai
 We are actually looking at the child of tomorrow
 khel main bachche bahari yatharth kii apeksha aantarik vichaar ke anusaar kaary karte hai
 The child sees one thing, but behaves differently than what he sees
 ek sthiti aa jaati he jab baccha apane dekhe hue se swatantra hokar vyavhaar karne lagata he
 Since in play one object needs to be replaced by another, the child begins to separate the idea or meaning of the object from the object
 jab vah ek block ko naav kii tarah istemaal karata he to ‘naavapan’ kaa vichaar vaastavik nauka se alag ho jaataa he
 When the block is to be made a boat, it replaces the boat
 jaise-jaise priskool ke bachche bade hote jate hai, vaise-vaise is tarah sthanapann banane kii unki kshamta main lacheelaapan badhata jaataa he
 Finally, objects can be transformed into symbols with a simple gesture or by saying 'agree'
 arth kaa vastu se pruthakkaran amoort vichaar tathaa amoort chintan kii taiyaari he
 In abstract thinking we evaluate, use and conduct our thoughts and concepts without pointing to the real world
 vastu ko avadharana se alag karne kii yah kriya lekhan kii ore sankraman kii taiyaari he, jahaan shabd apane dwaara suchit vastu jaisaa kuch nahin hota
 In the end, behavior is no longer driven by the object, it is no longer reactive
 vastuon kaa prayog duusari avadharanaon ko samajhane ke liye upkaran ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 By not using blocks as blocks, the child begins to use them as a support material for solving a problem, such as mathematics
 chunki khel-vishesh kii vishaywastu ke anusaar bhoomikaaon or niyamon kaa nirvaah karnaa hota he atah bacchon ke liye apane vyavhaar par roak or niyantran jaruri hota he
 Children cannot be arbitrary in sports, they have to act according to the situation
 dhai varsh kaa lui ghar-ghar khel rahaa he or kisi shishu kii tarah ro rahaa he
 It is implied in having an infant-like role that the father cry to the weeping Louis when he becomes silent
 uskaa vyavhaar chot kii pratikriya main nahin he
 He derives from the state of the game
 This treatment requires the same understanding that is used in higher mental tasks, so the game provides the context in which Louis can practice sensible behavior; This shows that he can control his behavior
 anya sandarbhon kii apeksha khel main adhik mahatvapurn dhang se niyantran or samaj-boojh kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, atah khel ucchtar maansik kaaryon ke liye nivikshe kaa nirmaan karata he
 Of all the students of Vygotsky, only Ekalonin focused his research on sports
 shodh ke dwaara inhone bade bacchon kii adhigam kii gatividhiyon ke vikaas or khel ke bich sambandh dikhaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Alconin elaborated Leontyev's concept of major activities and also characterized the characteristics that make sport a major activity
 alconin ke anusaar ek se teen varsh tak ke chote bacchon ke khel kii jaden hast-sanchaalan or uske dwaara anya upkarnon ke prayog kii gatividhiyon main hoti he
 Children explore the characteristics of objects by using hands and learn to use them by making them
 iske baad bachche rozmarra istemaal kii vastuon kaa kalpit sthitiyon main istemaal karnaa sikhte hai
 This is how the game is born
 udhaaharan ke liye do varsh kii lila ek chammach uthaati he or usase khaane kaa prayaas karti he
 She is learning to use the spoon not only to slam it on the table, but also in the traditional way like a spoon
 khel kaa pehla chihn tab ubharta he jab attharah maheene kaa jon chammach se apane bhaaluu ko khilaataa he yaa khud khaane kaa bahaanaa karata he
 The game begins with the child scrutinizing ordinary objects of daily use
 vyavhaar ke khel banane ke liye jaruri he ki baccha apane kaary ko shabdon main ek pahchaan de
 The role of language is important to change behavior from manipulation to sport
 shikshak bachche se poochta he, apane bhaaluu ko khaanaa khilaaoge ?’’ is tarah vah khel kii taraf sankraman main us bachche kii madad karata he jisane abhi-abhi chammach uthaaya he
 The twenty-month-old couple pushes their toy tank from behind and hears her voice
 uski shikshika kahati he, ‘‘apana tank chalaa kar idhar kyon nahin le aati? laakar petol bhar lo
 The pair listens and moves their tank to the teacher, who acts to fill her belly
 shikshika ke saath shabdon or harkaton ke is aadan-pradaan ke bina jodi keval tank ke pahiyon kii aawaaj or gati kii chaanbin hi karti rah jaati
 The behavior of the teacher raised the behavior of children from hand experimentation to a more sophisticated level by creating a new self
 is str par bacchee koi or hone kaa bahaanaa kar sakati he yaa vastu ko ek pratikatmak tareeke se istemaal kar sakati he
 Like Piaget, Alconin defines symbolic function as the use of one object as a synonym for another
 khel kaa darja paane ke liye vastuon kii chaanbin main pratikatmak prastuti kaa shaamil hona aavashyak he
 When a child presses, falls, or bangs an object, he or she is using hands with the object
 ise khel nahin kaha ja saktaa
 If he considers something to be foolish, swimming on the table and feeding him pieces of bread, then it is a game
 alconin ke anusaar priskool ke aarambhik varshon main khel vastu kii ore unmukh hota he
 At the center of the game is the object and the roles of those who play in the exchange are secondary
 teen saal ke jone or tomajo ghar-ghar khelte samay ek duusare se yah to kehete hai ki ‘ham ghar-ghar khel rahe hai, lekin apane parivaar ke vayaskon kii bhoomikaaon kaa naatak nahin karte
 And wash the plates, put the stove on the gas, shake the spoon and do not talk much to each other
 isaki tulana main priskool or kindergarton ke bade bacchon ke khel ke saath kiijie jo adhik samajonmukh hota he
 For five-year-olds, spooning in the pot and washing the plates become a reference for the complex roles they play
 unka khel vastu-kendrit nahin hota he, dhone or chamachaa chalaane kii kriyaaon kaa sankshepan yaa keval kathan bhi ho saktaa hai
 In a socially oriented role, the roles are fixed in dialogue and played over a longer period of time
 bacchee jo paatr khel rahi he, vahi ban jaati he
 This type of play is common for children from four to six years of age but in one form or another continues throughout the preschool period
 vaigotskeey dhaanche main samajonmukhi khel main duusare bacchon kaa shaamil hona anivaary nahin he
 The child can also play a game which is called 'director's game'
 In the director's game, the child directs and plays the game with his imaginary peers or toys
 ruibhre khilaunon or gudiyon ko lekar ijak simphni orcastaan ke sanchaalan kaa naatak karata he
 Maya plays school-school
 ek pal vah shikshak hoti he or duusare pal apane vidhyaarthee bhaaluu kii ore se bolti he
 Unlike some Western researchers, Vygotsky does not consider all games played in solitary to be immature
 akele khelte hue baccha yadi vahaan anya logon ke maujuud hone kaa bahaanaa karata he to nirdeshak kaa khel kalpit saamaajik khel ke samakaksh hota he
 Unlike Piaget, the Vygotskyists do not believe that by the time they reach the age of seven or eight, socially oriented sports cease
 das yaa gyaarah saal tak ke bachche bhi inako khelte hai kintu ek pramukh gatividhi ke rup main inkaa mahatv dhire-dhire lupt ho jaataa he
 As children get older, they develop more clear rules for their socially oriented games
 chah saal kaa frank kahata he, ‘‘yah bura aadmi he or bura aadmi hameshaa achche aadmi ko pakadaney aata he
 "I answer," but he won't catch up because good people are faster and their airplanes are better, so they will leave
 ‘‘bade hone ke saath-saath bachche bhoomikaayen or kaary tay karne main zyada samay lagane lagate hai or uske banisbat katha ko abhinit karne main kam
 In fact, six-year-old children spend several minutes discussing the story and only a few seconds of enacting it
 yah khel kaa ek bhinn prakaar he jo paanch varsh ke aasapaas ubharta he
 It is different from the game of the fictitious state in the sense that the fictitious situation is hidden and the rules are clear and detailed
 udhaaharan ke liye shatranj ke khel main ek kaalpanik sthiti rachi jaati he kyon ? kyonki usamen ghoda, hathi, raja, rani or isi tarah sab anya keval ek khaas nishchit prakaar se hi chal sakate hai
 The rules of moving the pieces and hitting the pieces are completely their own concepts of chess
 yadhyapi shatranj ke khel main vaastavik jivan ke sambandhon kaa koi sidhaa sthanapann nahin he lekin phir bhi, yah ek prakaar kii kaalpanik sthiti hi he
 ’’ doosraa udhaaharan footbal kaa khel he
 Players of this game are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands
 footbal is arth main ek kaalpanik sthiti he ki vaastavik jivan main vahi khilaadi gend ko ghumaane ke liye haathon kaa prayog kar saktaa he lekin footbal ke khel main khilaadiyon kii sahmati se tay he ki ve apane haathon kaa prayog nahin karenge, usee tarah jaise naatakeey khel ke pehle bachche tay kar lete hai ki ve khel ke dauraan kya kar sakate hai
 What else can not do bhoomikaaon or niyamon ke bich santulan ke swaroop ko dekhte hue kridaayen samajonmukh khelon se bhinn hai
 Roles are revealed in socially oriented games, rules are disguised
 bachche bhoomikaaon or unki apekshaaon par baat karte hai lekin niyambhang se khelbhang nahin hota
 If the child does anything other than the scheduled sequence, then it does not disturb the game
 iske vipareet krida main niyam spasht hote hai
 Sports cannot be broken by breaking the rules
 sabhi khelon ko ekpramukh gatividhi nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki har prakaar ke khelon main vyavhaar, vikaas ko protsaahit nahin karata
 Following are the salient features of the game which prepares the child for further learning: - teen saal kii umr ke bacchon main in lakshanon main se kuch ke ubhaar kii shuruuaat hi hoti he parantu kindergarton se baahar aane tak bachche main ye saare lakshan viksit ho jane chahie
 According to Vygotsky and Alconin, drama that continues for extended periods of time demands more self-control, planning, and memory, pushing the child to the highest levels of the near-development zone
 khel ke ucchtar str par bachche vastuon or karyaan kaa prayog kinhin anya vastuon or kaaryon ke sthanapann kii tarah pratikatmak dhang se karte hai
 Children playing at this level do not close their game if they do not get the exact same toy or item of need
 ve keval kisi or vastu ko sthanapann kii tarah istemaal kar lete hai
 Even they can agree to pretend that the object exists, without any physical replacement
 is str par ve karyaan ke saath bhi pratikatmak vyavhaar karte hai
 To play the game of building collapse, they can consider the building as collapsing without dropping any structure
 unhen bas yah kehane kii jarurat he, ‘maan lo’ gir gayi
 Conditions that promote such invention will encourage the game even more
 ucchtar khel main anek vishaywastu ho sakati hai, jo aapas main gunth kar ek sampurna ikai ban jaati hai
 In the flow of play, children involve other people, toys and ideas without any hindrance
 asambaddh si dikhne vaali vishyavastuon kaa ekikaran bhi ve apni kalpit sthiti main kar lete hai
 For example, while playing a game of ambulance repair, they can also add the idea of sudden recovery of a mechanic
 ab doctor ko bulaanaa hoga yaa mistre ko aspataal le janaa hoga
 In this way they intertwine the contents of the garage with the contents of the hospital
 ucchtar str par khel main bachche ek hi samay main anek bhoomikaaye apana sakate hai, unako samanvit kar sakate han
 At lower levels, they perform stereotypical roles related to the same theme, such as feeding the infant, washing plates in the role of a mother
 khel jab ucchtar str par aa jaataa he to maan kaam ke liye daphtar jaati he, biimaar bachche ko lekar aspataal jaati he, phir doctor ban kar bachche kaa ilaaj karti he, iske baad rota hua baccha bhi ban jaati he or is sabake baad maan kii apni mul bhoomika main waapas laut aati he
 At higher levels, two sides of the game appear from the extended structure of time in the game
 ek to yah ki baccha kitne samay tak khel ko chalaa saktaa he
 The longer the child can sustain the subsistence of various roles, the higher the level of play
 duusare, yah ki khel ek din se adhik chalata he yaa nahin
 Older children can play the same game of war or hospital continuously for several days
 chaar saal kaa baccha bhi madad ke dwaara ek khel ko kai din tak khel saktaa he
 Early childhood teachers do not run the game for extended periods
 ve khel ko adhiktar ek din ke liye simit rakhte hai
 According to Vygotsky and Alconin, the play that continues for extended periods of time demands more introspection, organizing, and memory, pushing the child to the highest levels of self-determination
 shikshak ko jab khel main madad karne kii salaah dete hai to iskaa taatpary yah nahin ki ve swayan bacchon ke saath khelen yaa unke samooh kaa ek sadsy ban kar khel kaa sanchaalan karen
 Remember, it is important for the child to be active and excited for the game
 bachche vibhinn kaarnon se khelte hai
 It does not happen in their exchange with adults
 ek vayask ke saath aadan-pradaan bachche ko adheenta kii bhoomika main rakh detaa he
 Whatever the teacher does, the child remains a child
 khel main bachche anek bhoomikaaye apanaate or aajamaate hai
 If the teacher leads the game too much, then the child never gets a chance to pretend
 iskaa ek or nuksaan yah he ki shikshak ko bhi is baat kii jhalak nahin milegi ki har bachche ke nivikshe main kya maujuud he
 The teacher's work has a tendency to highlight the child's side
 peeche hatakar bachche ko apane saathiyon ke saath aadan-pradaan karte dekhakar hi shikshak yah samaj paaegaa ki bhinn saamaajik sandarbhon main uski sambhaavnaayen kya hai
 Different social contexts will show the teacher the aspect of the child which he cannot know in any other way
 iske baavjood khel kii prakriya main shikshak kii madad kii bhoomika mahatvapurn he
 Sensitive teachers who provide appropriate support at the level of play in the classroom have a very positive effect
 khel main aadhaar pradaan karne ke liye shikshak nimnlikhit upaay kar sakate hai : Preschool older children require a definite period of time to develop themes and roles for rich social play
 unhen har din samay chahie taaki vishaywastu ko ek din se duusare din tak le jaaya ja sake
 The time for the game should also be sufficient - from thirty to forty minutes - so that the game can run uninterrupted
 kindergarton or pehali duusari kaksha main liye khel ek mahatvapurn mudda he
 Kindergarten children are generally not given time to play in school, so the mixed age groups for sports may have a negative consequence that children in kindergarten will have less time for in-game exchanges
 aarambhik praathmik kakshaon main khel pratidin ke kaarykram kaa hissaa nahin hua karata
 Children are expected to play in the mid-day
 hamaara vishwaas he ki skool ke aarambhik varshon main khel atyant mahatvapurn hai
 The time for the game should be fixed other than the mid-day or the duration of the mid-day should be extended
 khel samaapt hone ke baad bacchon se puuchhiye ki kya kal bhi ve ise chalaayenge or unhen yah sochane ko prerit kiijie ki kal ke liye kya bachaakar rakhen
 Next day, before the start of the game, look at the plan and activities of the previous day
 yaad rahe, yojana se chipke rahanaa apane aap main ek lakshya nahin he
 It is only a tool that helps children to engage in their work
 bachche ke khel ke str ko dekhie
 If he is playing mainly with commodities then the incumbency would be beneficial to take him to the next level of development
 bachche kii madad ke liye shikshak uske khel ko kisi kaalpanik sandarbh se jod saktaa he
 For example, while making clay cakes, the child may be asked whether you are making these cakes for eating or will you sell them in the market? 'sometimes this is just enough gesture to start a fantasy game

 Radhabai was the daughter of the Barve family of Newas who was married to Balaji Vishwanath
 inke pita kaa naam duberkar antaji malhaar barve tha
 Radhabai Balaji's father Vishwanath Bhatt was Deshmukh of Shrivardhan village under Siddis
 bharat ke pashchimi siddiyon se na patane ke kaaran vishwanath or balaji shrivardhan gaanv chhodkar bela naamak sthaan par bhanu bhaaiyon ke saath rahane lage
 Radhabai also started living in Bela with her family
 kuch samay pashchaat balaji dandaraajapuri ke deshmukh ho gaye
 From 1699 AD to 1708 AD, he was the head of Poona
 radhabai main tyaag, dridhtaa, kaarykushalta, vyavahaarchaaturya or udaartaa aadi gun the
 Radhabai and Balaji had two sons and two daughters

 The names of their daughters were Anubai and Bhiubai
 balaji vishwanath kii mrityu san 1720 main hui
 Radhabai felt very sad, though his son Bajirao Peshwa was made
 radhabai rajya ke vibhinn kaaryon main bajirao ko uchit salaah detii thim
 When Radhabai expressed her desire to go on a pilgrimage in 1735, Chimaji Appa soon managed it
 14 farvari ko inhone puna se prasthaan kiya
 On 8 March, she reached Burhanpur
 6 may ko udaipur main unhen rajkeey sammaan mila
 Visited Nathdwara on 21 May and reached Jaipur on 21 June

 Mohammad Khan Bangash respected Radhabai very much and gave him valuable gifts
 radhabai prasann hui or 1 june, 1736 i
 ko puna pahunchin
 This visit by Radhabai created a friendly atmosphere for the Marathas in general and the Peshwa Bajirao in particular
 radhabai ko yatra se laut do varsh bhi na ho paae the ki unhen ek or paristhiti kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Mastani and Bajirao's relationship had become the subject of criticism from the Sardars
 bajirao ke aalochakon kaa vartav us samay or teevr hua jab peshwa parivaar main raghunatha raav kaa upanayan or sadashiv raav kaa vivaah hone vaala tha
 The pundits decided not to participate in any such work
 radhabai ne bajirao ko vishesh rup se satark rahane ke liye likhaa
 Finally Radhabai succeeded in getting the above mentioned work done
 mastaani or bajirao ke sambandh ko vishesh mahatv kabhi nahin diya apitu sadaa hi yah praytn kiya ki parivaar main foot kii sthiti na utpann ho or peshwa parivaar kaa sammaan bhi bana rahe
 Chimaji Appa imprisoned Mastani
 radhabai ne mastaani ko kaid se chhudaaya or vah bajirao ke paas aa gai
 Bajirao also followed Radha Bai's orders

 Five months later, Chimaji Appa also died
 ab radhabai kaa utsaah shithil pad gaya
 Nevertheless, whenever required, she used to give proper advice to Balaji Bajirao in family service and state work
 1752 i

 barason ke adhyayan ke baad jab 1916 main albert oinstin ne is siddhant kii ghoshnaa kii to vigyaan kii duniya main tahalaka much gaya or dhai-sau saal se qaayam ijak newton dwaara 1687 main ghoshit brahmand kaa nazariyaa hameshaa ke liye ulat diya gaya
 It had such a profound effect on physics that people began to describe modern physics as a subject different from classical physics and Albert Einstein came to be considered the father of modern physics
 dik sanskrit kaa shabd he jiskaa arth he ird-gird kii jagah
 It is called "space" in English
 manushya dik ke teen pahaluon ko bhaap sakane kii kshamta rakhte hai- upar-neeche, aage-peeche or daayen-baayein
 In ordinary life, humans do not see any change in problems
 newton kii bhautikee kahati thi ki agar antariksh main do vastuen ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hai or un donon main se koi bhi na hile, to ve ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hi rahengi
 Our ordinary life also shows us this
 lekin inastin ne kaha ki aisa nahin he
 The problem may worsen and shrink
 aisa bhi sambhav he ki jo do vastuen ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hai ve swayan na hilen, lekin unke bich kaa dik kuch paristhitiyon ke kaaran fail kar sava kilometre ho jaae yaa sikud ke pauna kilometre ho jaae
 In Newton's classical physics, it was said that the speed of time is the same everywhere in the universe
 agar aap ek jagah tik kar baithe hai or aapkaa koi mitra prakaash se aadhi gati kii raftaar par das saal kaa safar tay kare to, us safar ke baad, aapke bhi das saal guzar chuke honge or aapke dost ke bhi
 But Einstein also said that this belief is wrong
 jab koi chiz gati se chalati he, uske liye samay dhire ho jaataa he or vah jitna tej chalati he, samay utana hi dhire ho jaataa he
 If your friend returned by traveling at half the speed of light for ten years according to his own, then ten years would have passed but eleven and a half years would have passed
 inastin ne saapekshata siddhant main dikhaaya ki vastav main dik ke teen or kaal kaa ek milakar brahmand main chaar pahaluon vaala dik-kaal he jisame sari vasteen or urjaayen sthit hotin hai
 This problem is not permanent - neither problem occurs without any change and it is not necessary that the flow of time is the same for every thing
 dik-kaal ko prabhavit kar ke use maroda, khinchaa or sikoda ja saktaa he or aisa hi brahmand main hota he
 The concept of time travel has been created through this principle
 dik-kaal main badlaav har vastu or har raftaar paidaa karti he lekin badi vasteen or prakaash ke sameep kii raftaarein adhik badlaav paidaa karti hai
 Humans are so small and their speed is so slow that they do not see the effects of the theory of relativity in their lives, but when they study more things in the universe, they find signs of relativity in many places
 jab vastu kaa veg prakaash ke veg kaa 5% bhi ho jaae, to saapekshata ke siddhanth ke chinh hame dikhaai dene lagate he
 Newton believed that every object had a force to pull towards itself, which he called gravity
 prithvi jaisi badi chiz main yah gurutvkarshan bahut adhik hota he, jisase ham prithvi se chipke rahete hai or anayas hi ud kar antariksh main nahin chale jate
 But Newton could not explain how the force of gravity actually works and why
 inastin ne kaha ki aapekshikta ke siddhanth ke anusaar yah vichaar ki bhautik vastuen ek doosar ko aakarshith karti hai, ek bhram he, jo prakruti sambandhi galat yantrik dharanaon ke kaaran paidaa hua he
 He said that the earth is large and because of that the time period around him has turned and folded over itself
 ham is khiche-mude dik-kaal main rahete hai or is mudan kii vajah se prithvi ke qareeb dhakele jate hai
 This can be compared to a sheet whose four corners have been pulled by four people
 ab is chadar ke bich main ek baari gola rakh diya jaae, to chadar bich se baith jaaegi, yani uske soot main bich main mudan paidaa ho jaaegi
 Now if we place a light ball on the corner of the sheet, it will roll towards the big circle
 inastin ne kaha ki koi anaadi aadmi yah dekh kar kah saktaa he ki choti gend ko bade gole ne khinchaa isliye gend uske paas gai
 But the real reason was that the ball wanted to go towards the ground and the shell created such a twist in the sheet that the ball went to him
 isi tarah se unhone kaha ki yah ek mithyaa he ki gurutvkarshan kisi aakarshan kii vajah se hota he
 The real reason for gravity is that every object which is moving in space, comes under the influence of such a problem of difficulty and starts moving towards something bigger
 vastut: gurutvkarshan jadta kaa ek bhaag maatr he, taare or grahon kii gatividhiyaan, unke swabhaavgat jadtv se utpann hotin hai or unka maarg dik-kaal-satati ke vrittiya tatwon par nirbhar karata he
 Just as there is a magnetic field around the magnet, the celestial object scatters a field in the sky around it
 jis tarah chumbakeey kshetra main ek lohe ke tukade kii gatividhi kshetra kii banaavat se nirdeshit hoti he usee tarah gurutveey kshetra main kisi vastu kaa maarg us kshetra kii jyamithik avasthaa se nirdhaarit hota he
 Einstein's law of gravitation gives information about the regional elements of the time constant
 mukhyat: is niyam kaa ek bhaag gurutvkarshanjanya vastu ke chaaron ore ke kshetra ke dhaanche se sambandh vyakt karata he
 a great proof of Einstein's spreading theory came from seeing the effect of gravity on light
 newton kii bhautikee main siddhant tha ki do vasteen ek-duusare ko donon ke dravyaman ke anusaar khinchati hai
 But there is no mass of light, that is, zero
 to newton ke mutabiq jis chiz kaa koi dravyaman yaa vazan hi nahin uskaa kisi duusari vastu ke gurutvkarshan se khichne kaa sawaal hi nahin banataa chaahe duusari vastu kitni bhi badi kyon na ho
 Light always moves in a straight line
 lekin agar inastin sahi he or kisi badi vastu kii vajah se dik hi mud jaae, to roshni bhi dik ke mudane ke saath mud jaani chahie
 That is, large objects located in the universe should act as lenses - just as the lens of glasses, binoculars or microscope turns light, the stars and planets should also bend
 1924 main ek orest khwolson naam ke roosi bhautikavigyaani ne inastin ke saapekshata siddhant ko samajhakar bhavishyavaanee kii ki aise gurutvkarshak lens brahmand main zarur honge
 Fifty-five years later, this was first noticed in 1979 when two images were seen, instead of one, of an object called twin quasars
 uske baad kaafii dur-daraaj vastuon kii aisi chhaviyaan dekhi ja chuki hai jinamein un vastuon or prithvi ke bich koi bahut badi anya vastu rakhi ho jo pehali vastu se aa rahi prakaash kii kirnon par lenson kaa kaam kare or uski chhavi ko yaa to marod de yaa aasmaan main uski ek se zyaada chhavi dikhaae
