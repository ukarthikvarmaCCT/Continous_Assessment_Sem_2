 In mathematical terms, the f n sequence of Fibonacci numbers can be represented by the rotation relation- tathaa, The Fibonacci sequence is named after Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa, who was known as Fibonacci
 fibonachi dwaara likhit 1202 kii pustak liber abek ne pashchim europea ganit main is anukram ko pravartit kiya, haalanki pehle hi bhartiya ganit main is anukram kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 The Fibonacci sequence was very well known in ancient India, where it was applied to versification science long before it became prevalent in Europe
 iske vikaas kaa shrey pingala, virahanka, gopal, tathaa hemchandra ko diya jaataa he
 The Fibonacci sequence is prepared by adding s to a sample of n - 1 length, or by adding l to a sample of n - 2 length; And the scribes showed that samples of n length are the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence

 In the west, Leonardo of Pisa studied this sequence known as Fibonacci in his Liber Abaci
 unhone ek adarsh khargosh kii aabaadi ke vikaas par yah maanate hue vichaar kiya ki: Its rule is that one pair of rabbits produces 2 pairs in its lifetime and dies
 maan len ki n maheene main aabaadi f he
 At this time, only those rabbits, which survived at n - 2 months, are fertile and produce offspring, so f pairs are added to the existing population F

 Like every sequence defined by linear rotation, the Fibonacci number has a whole-formula solution
 It is known as the Binet Sutra, although he was previously known as Abraham de Moivre: 
 Fibonacci Repatriation svarnim anupaat ke nirdharak sameekaran ke samaan nimnatah he Which is known as the productive polynomial of alternation
 uparyukt sameekaran kaa koi mul x 2 = x + 1, { \ displaystyle { \ begin{matrix}x^{2}=x+1, \ end{matrix}} \ ,} kaa samaadhaan karata he or x n − 1 { \ displaystyle x^{n-1} \ ,} dwaara guna karne se nimna darshata he: By definition φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi \ ,}, is the root of the equation and the second root is 1 - φ = - 1 / φ
 { \ displaystyle 1- \ varphi \ , = - 1 / \ varphi \ ,
}
 So: or Both φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n = n { \ displaystyle ^ {n} = ^ {n}} are geometric series that solve the Fibonacci alternation
 The first series expands exponentially; The second, exponentially, with alternating signs, leads to zero
 Since the Fibonacci alternation is linear, any linear combination of these two series can also solve the alternation
 These linear combinations create a two-dimensional linear vector difference; The original Fibonacci sequence can be found in this difference
 raikhik sanyojanon kii shrinkhlaayein φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^{n}} or n { \ displaystyle ^{n}}, a tathaa b gunankon sahit, nimna dwaara paribhaashit kii ja sakati hai All the series defined in this way satisfy the Fibonacci alternation
 jahaan apeksha he ki f a, b = 0 { \ displaystyle F_{a,b}=0} or f a, b = 1 { \ displaystyle F_{a,b}=1} pratifal a = 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle a=1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} or b = − 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle b=-1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} dete hai, jiske parinamswaroop vahi binet sutara miltaa he, jisase hamane shuru kiya tha
 yah darshaya gaya he ki yah sutara fibonachi prayaavartan kii purti karata he
 iske alaava, ek suspasht jaanch kii ja sakati he: And aagaman ke mul prashnon siddh karte hue, pramanit karte hai ki Therefore, for any two initial values, the combination a, b { \ displaystyle a, b} can be found such that the functions f a, b { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} \ ,}, are accurate to the sequence

 for example, f 1 = 1, f 3 = 2, f 5 = 5, f 7 = 13, f 9 = 34 = 2×17, f 11 = 89, f 13 = 233, f 15 = 610 = 2×5×61 ∑ k = nn + 9 f k = 11 f n + 6 { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {k = n} ^ {n + 9} F_ {k} = 11F_ {n + 6}} udhaaharan ke liye, let n = 1: f 1 + f 2 + 


 + f 10 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 = 143 = 11 × 13n = 2: F2 + F3 +

 + F8 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 = 55 = 11 × 5n = −2: F−2+F−1+F0+


+F7 = −1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 33 = 11×3 It can be easily seen that if the units of the Fibonacci sequence take mod n, then the resulting sequence with at most n 2 rotations must be iterative

 i hope you once gave a boon to Ravan
 usne sitaaji ko pareshaan kiya tha
 So, what advice should i give you that you feel right
 shivaji bole : aap suno umiya maay re, jo meri seva karke jal chadhaaye uski kaaya karu nirmal re
 jo seva karke sugandh chadhaaye uski buddhi karu dhan dhan re
 jo muje chadhaaye billy patr use du sone kayaa chaatr re
 jo meri seva karke bajaaye jaltal use kardu nyaal re
 nari pani i buddhi aapaki, dene kii liye na kare deree 
 me to bholaa nath hu, ab kapati nath kaise ho jaau 
 aisa bol kar chale bholenath or rakhaa banasur ke sheer pe haath
 And he said Jag Bansur Rai Jatuje Vardan de Shivriya
 bansur bolaa : me to jag rah hu bhagvan, dedo shonitpur kaa raaj re
 i am here again and again, i am happy aisa upkar kijie das hajaar hathi jitna bal dijie
 Astu Keh Kar Shiva Zi, Vardan Diya and Banasur were enthroned by son Kar
 vardaan paa kar banasur shonitpur me vaapis gaya
 At that time, all the animal petals started to get scared and it seemed as if someone was running in the winter
 jab wo apane nagar ke najadik aayaa to sirf uske pradhan ne hi usko pahachaanaa
 After that he got married and after that he started conquering all the countries one after the other, he did not leave even Hades, now he wished to win heaven and he went to conquer heaven and all the gods went away from his fear
 
 usne surya tak ko bhi jeet liya
 When he was going back after conquering the sun, Narada ji told him fair and he bowed to Naradji
 Go to war kailash parvat par jake usne usko hilana shuru kiya yah dekh kar parvati ji dar gayi or shivaji ke paas ja kar boli are are shivaray jisko aapane shonitpur kaa rajya diya hajaaro haath die ab wo yaha kya maangane vaapis aayaa he?banasur bolaa : aapane muje hajaaro haath die yah atya he par ab ladane ke liye muje koi samarth yodadhan bhi dijiye or mere saath yuddh kijiye
 Shivji said: Leave this Jid, or else you will regret it a lot
 shivaji bole tumne yah thik nahi kiya, isiliye me tumhen yah shraap detaa hoon kii aisa koi aayegaa tumhaare jo haath kaat degaa or tumhaare anek tukde karke tumhen maar degaa |dar ke maare banasur bolaa : main yah kaise jaanoonga ki vah vyakti koun he, jo aansa karegaa?shivaji bole : to le banasur me tuje ek dhwaja de rahaa hoon, jab yah dhwaja tut jaae tab tere haath cat jaayenge or tere nagar me khun kii barish hogi| tab tu yah jaan jayega ki teri maut aa gai he
 Taking this boon, Banasur returned to his Sonitpur
 ek deen mahadev ji ko tap karne jane kaa man hua
 Hearing this, Parvati ji started crying a lot and said, "hey Shiva, how will my birth be cut and i don't even have a child
" tab mahadev ne vardaan dete hue kaha aap ek putr or ek putree upjaae
 Mahadev Ji went to meditate in the forest with a boon
 umiya ji nahane ke liye baithe or unhone sochaa kii shiva ke ghar bade dekhakar koi bhi aata jaataa raheta he, to kyon na me balak ko daravaaje par rakhu to wo baithe baithe dekhe
 He matched his Dakshinam organ to create an eagle form
 haath pav or tunkaa kad banaaya, chaar bhujaa or bada pet, jo dekh ne me lage vishaal, uski shobhaa kaa to kya kahena? unke kanth me ghughar maala
unke pehle kar me jalkamandal, duusare kar me modak aahaar, tisare kar me firsi shobhe or chothe kar me japamala
 Parvati ji said after growing Ganesha, if there is anyone near her, she should sit and talk
 yah soch kar unhone vam ang se mail leki ek ladki banaai uski shobhaa kaa to varanna hi nahi kar sakate
 Now both siblings started playing
 devi jab nahane ke liye baithe tab naarad ji waha aae 
 unhone do balak waha baithe hue dekhe to voh waha se chale gaye or jaha shivaji the waha par gaye, madhuban me aakarnarada ji bole : ore shivaji ore shivaji naffat bhundi aapaki tev
 Dust figure on the head, eat the dust, eat Dhaturo Vijaya
 aap re van me or aap ke ghar me chalaa gharsutra
 Without you, Umiya Ji produced two children
 mahadev ji waha se kailash ke liye nikle
 After reaching there, Ganpati Ji kept the fair and sword and said Ore Jatadhari Jogi
 bhasma lagaakar bahot adbhut dikhta he, koi bhi paravaanagi binaa andar nahi ja saktaa
 Hearing this, Shivji was enraged and kicked Ganpati and went inside the house
 ganapati aisen gire jaise brahmand tut padaa
 Trilok started screaming, oh what happened? Now Shivaji became angry, and in anger he pierced the head of Shri Ganesh
 shivji ne mahoshar maah ke krishn paksh ke chothe din ganesh ji kaa sheer chheda usee deen se ganesh choth ke vrath kaa prarambh hua
 He fell in the chariot of the mother of the moon
 isi liye chaturthi ke deen chandra pujan hota he
 Now Shiva came to the house where Umiya was taking a bath
 use dekhakar darkar okha ghar me chali gai
 Went into hiding in the salt shop or man hi man me sochane lagi kii bhaiya ko maaraa ab muje bhi maar daalenge
 When Mahadev ji went to the house, Umiya ji said after opening the netra: Mahadev ji, why have you come back, figure, it is your habit to eat spaghetti, but do you know why there is no place to come? You do not understand anything? i have placed two children at the door, yet how did you come to the mandir? Shivji said: Shut up, o sinner, i saw everything and understood, till this day i knew you
 par tumne to sab kuch lut liya
 How was your child without me? Wow! Have you named Himachal, wow! On hearing this, Umiya ji came very angry and said only yesterday that you were told that the debt was exposed
 tab shankar ji shame se neeche dekhakar bole tumhaari putree kahi chali gayi or tumhaare putr ko maine maar daalaa
 Plain Bina Jure Weldy, Calf Bina Jure Cow
 bhai ke bina jure bahendi, putr binaa jure maat
 Money grain and son, son and son
 jis ghar putr nahi, us ghar ke sune jaale mashaan
 Son Bina home Pinjar, fire burning in the forest
 shiva kyon maaraa ganapati ko, me ab meraa putr kaha se paau ?bolo ho bal ganapati, bolo ho bal, shiva ne kyo maaraa ho ganapati
 Umiya ji said while crying, how can she be lightened by the son of Shiv, when she felt conscious, i was given a boon
 ye to wo naarad kaa kaam ho ganapati, usne juuth bolaa
usne sab juthi baat kahi or me tap se uth ke aayaa
 i killed how did you like it today? reetikaal ke reetigranthkaar kavi hai

 The arcade game is an entertainment machine operated by coins, usually placed at public trade centers such as restaurants, public establishments and video arcades
 adhikansh arched game pratidaan khel, vyapaar, video game, yaa pinbaal mashin ke khel hote hai
 Popular "arcade games" began as amusement park midway games, such as shooting galleries, ball toss games, and early coin-operated machines such as claiming to be someone's fortune or playing machine music
 The old midways of 1920s-era amusement parks provided the inspiration and ambience for later arcade games
 1930 ke dashak main, praarambhik sikaa-sanchalit pinbaal mashiinon kaa nirmaan hua tha
 These early instruments differed from their later electronic descendants, were made of wood, did not have pistons or luminous dividend surfaces in the playing field, and used electronic measures instead of electronic scoring readable data
 1977 ke aasapaas se utpaadit hone vaali adhikansh pinbaal mashiinon main sanchaalan or scoring donon hi ke liye thos rup se electronics kaa upyog kiya jane laga
 In 1971, students at Stanford University launched the Galaxy game, a coin-operated version of the space-wise game
 sikaa-sanchalit video game kaa yah sabase purana gyaat udhaaharan he
 Later that same year, Nolan Bushnell created the first large-scale game, such as Computer Space, for Nutting Associates
 1972 main, nolan bushnel tathaa ted dabni dwaara ataari kaa gathan kiya gaya
 Atari originally created the coin-operated video game industry with Pong games; Pong is a popular electronic ping pong video game
 pong lokapriy sabit hua, lekin nakalchiyon ne ataari ko sikaa-sanchalit video game bazaar par haaavee nahin hone diya
 In the late 1970s and early 1980s, video game arcades popped up in malls, restaurants, small "corner arcades", grocery stores, bars, and cinema halls all over the United States and other countries
 spes inveders, gallexion, pack-main, battlezone or donki kong jaise game vishesh rup se lokapriy hue
 During the late '70s and' 80s, arcades were established in traditional restaurants and / or bars, including chains such as Chuck E
 Cheeses, Ground Round, Dave & Busters, and Gottys Pizza
 1980 ke dashak ke antim charan main, home video consol praudyogiki kii pragati se arched video game kaa unmaad kam hona shuru hua
 Arcade video games resurfaced with the arrival of two-player fighting games such as Capcom's Street Fighter II, Midway Games' Mortal Combat, snk's Fatal Fury: King of Fighters, Rare's Killer Instinct, and snk's The King of Fighters
 haalanki 1996 tak, 3di twarak card ke saath gharelu video game consol or computer arched upkaran takanic samanta tak pahunch gaya he - arched game hameshaa upyogi vastu takanic par aadhaarit hota he, lekin puraani peedi ke gharelu system par laabh inke anukulit karne kii kshamta or iske naveenatam graphics or dhwani card par nirbhar karata he; jaisaa ki aaj ke pisi gemon main hota he
 The decline in arcade sales meant that the method was no longer profitable
 iske alaava, 1990 ke dashak ke antim charan or 2000 kii shuruuaat main, consol ke jariye network kiye hue or internet se jude computer khel bhi saamne aaye, jisane aamane-saamne kii pratispardhaa or arched dwaara purv main pradutt saamaajik vaataavaran kaa sthaan le liya
 Arcade games also lost their status due to the introduction of new games
 kisi arched main kisi game ko teen yaa chaar baar khilne or video game consol ko lagbhag usee mulya par kiraaye par lene kii tulana kii jaye to consol hi spasht rup se behatar sabit hota he
 Combat games were the most attractive feature in arcade games, as they offered the possibility of face-to-face competition and tournaments that provided players with more opportunities to practice accordingly, but this helped the trade on its own
 Not found praasangik bane rahane ke liye, arceyds ne video games ke saath redempshan games, vyapaar or khan-paan jaisi kuch anya suvidhaon ko bhi pradaan karnaa shuru kar diya
 Some old chains, such as Chuck E
 Cheese's and Gutz's Pizza, called "fun Centers" or "family Fun Centers" followed the same approach
 Many old video game arcades have been closed for a long time and traditional coin-operated games are now played mainly by older amateurs
 aaj arceyds ne un khelon main apana ek vishisht sthaan bana liya he, jinamein vishesh niyantrakon kaa upyog hota he jo gharelu upyogkartaaon ko aprapya hai
 An alternative explanation is that arcade games have now become more socially-oriented sites, where individual performance is preferred over game content
 dance dance revolution or drum mania jaise taal game or varchua cop, time chrysis or house of da ded jaise rail shooters game aaj kii lokapriy shaileyon ke udhaaharan hai
 Virtually all types of modern arcade games have broadened the use of solid state electronics and integrated circuits
 puraane samay main sikke se sanchalit arched video game bahut saare sipiu, ati vishisht dhwani or graphics chips tathaa computer graphics main naveenatam disple takanic ke saath aamtaur par custom prati-game hardware kaa istemaal kiya karte hai
 Recent arcade game hardware is based on modified video game console hardware or higher-end PC components
 arched games main aksar pisi yaa consol kii tulana main vishisht maahaul yaa niyantran sahaayak saamagree samet kahin adhik tallin karanevaala or yathartwaadee game niyantran hota he: bal pratikriya niyantran, samarpit litagan, rier projection disple, automobile yaa airplane cockpit kaa punarutpaadan karanevaala, motorcycle yaa ghode ke aakaar ke niyantrak yaa daancing mat yaa machhlee pakadaneyvaali chadi jaise bahut hi samarpit niyantrak ke saath puri tarah se band gatyaatmak cabinet hota he
 These accessories usually separate modern arcade games from PC or console games, as they are usually very heavy and expensive and can only be used on home pcs and consoles
 arched games ke str aksar bahut chote hote hai or niyantran kaaphi saral or sahaj hota he jabaki kathinaayee kaa str teji se badhata he
 This is due to the arcade environment, where the player only plays the game as long as his avatar remains alive in the game
 consol yaa pisi ke khelon ko bhi "arched games" ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, agar unamem bhi ye khaasiyat maujuud hon yaa ve jo arched tital ke direct port hon
 kai swatantra developers game ko arched style main pesh kar rahe hai, jinhen vishesh rup se internet par istemaal karne ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 These games are usually designed with Flash / Java / DHTML and run directly on the web-browser

 Cars can be twisted rapidly without braking or understeering, and AI opponents are sometimes programmed in such a way that they always stay close to the player
 flite simmulator kii tulana main arched flite games adhik sarlikrut bhautikee or niyantran kaa bhi istemaal karte hai
 Their aim is to make the learning curve easier so that their action related component can be preserved
 tatkaal arched flite ection ke paksh main crimson skyse se lekar es combat or sikret vepans over normandi tak consol flite arched game kii badhati sankhya, minial-heavi flite sim kii girti hui lokapriyata kaa sanket detii he
 Issues that can be run on modern computers and many other devices, such as emulators, try to preserve old obsolete games
 haalanki ab arched games kii yayi virtual consol sarvice ke madhyam se nakal kii ja rahi he; isaki shuruyaat 2009 main gaplus, ameraldia, mapi, solvaalu, spes herier, star force, da tower of druaga tathaa da ritern of ishtaar evam saal ke ant main aane vaale spes invaders, splator house jaise anya khelon se hui
 In addition, Asteroids, Tron, Disks of Tron, Yi Er Kung-fu, pac-man, Jost, Battlezone, Dig Doug Robotron: 2084, and Missile Command have all been copied on Xbox Live Arcade
 arched games ko restaraan tathaa video arceyds ke alaava bowling elese, college campason, dormatteriyon, londromeet, cinema theatreon, supermarket, shopping mal, hawaii addon, trek stopon, baar / pabon, hotalon or yahaan tak ki bekariyon main bhi dekha jaataa he
 In short, arcade games are very popular in public places where people have free time

 atev sarabhoot vidhi ke rup main apakruti kanoon kaa vikaas aadhunik kaal main hua
 Long before the adoption of the English law in India, in the distant past, evidences of the law of defamation are found
 manu, yajyavlky, naarad, vyas, brihaspati tathaa katyayan kii smritiyon main apakruti sambandhi hindu vidhipranali kaa aadhaar hamen miltaa he
 An important difference between the Hindu and English defamation-law systems is that retaliation by compensation in the Hindu system is possible only when economic loss has occurred, not in cases of aggression or defamation or adultery

 This photo was made from Florence's anonymous friend Liza Gherardini, wife of businessman Francesco del Giocondo

 Approximately 500 years ago, this painting was done with oil paints on a 30
5 ”tall 20 7 / 8 wide, 12 mm thickness Poplar wood panel
 is kalakriti ko banane vaale kaaljayi kalakaar leonardo da vinci kaa janm itli ke florence shahar ke purv disha main sthit vinci naamak ek chote se kasbe main san 1452 ko hua tha
 His father Sir Pierre the Vinci was a notary
 bachapan se hi kala main liyanardo kii gahari ruchi dekhte hue pita ne kala kii ucch shiksha ke liye use paris bhej diya
 Which was a major center of art education at that time, by staying here, he started learning art in one of the Barakia studios
 yahan rahakar liyanardo ne apane guru se chitrakala kaa vyapak gyaan praapt kiya va isaki baarikiyon se parichit hue
 Soon the Guru felt that his disciple was more talented and talented than him, so he gave all the knowledge that Guru had to his disciple Vinci
 chitrakala ke atirikt ejineering, maanav sharir sanrachana ke adhyayan main bhi liyanardo ko maharath hasil thi
 Hundreds of years before the birth of the Wright brothers, it was difficult to imagine an airplane, when Leonardo made a model of a machine flying in the air
 maanav sharir kii jatil sanrachana ko samajhane ke junun ke chalate liyanardo raat ke andhere main kabristaan se shav khod kar studiyon main laakar uski cheerfaad karte
 Used to write detailed notes by cutting and drawing internal organs of human body
 ye aitihaasik rekhachitr va tippaniyan aaj bhi surakshit hai, yun to liyanardo ne apane jivan main saikadon chitra va rekhachitr banaaye hai jinamein se kuch prasiddh kala-kritiyon ke naam hai, da last sapar, madonna in ityadi par jitani adhik khyaati monaalisa naamak kriti ko mili he, vah vastav main haratangez he
 This painting, which adorned the French royal art collection until 1805, is now on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris
 is tasviir ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki portret main chitrit mahila italy ke ek dhani resham vyapaaree kii patni thi
 Beautiful river, tree and waterfall natural scenes are seen in the background of the picture
 aisa lagata he jaise studiyon main ek vishaal khuli hui khidki ke saamne baitaakar vishay ko chitrit kiya gaya he
 In 2007, French engineer Pascal Côté announced that his ultra-high resolution scan on the picture showed that Monalisa was actually painted with eyebrows but over time these colors were gone
 unhone iske peeche atyadhik safai ko ek sambhavit vajah mana
 Based on the documents obtained from the Florence where the painting began to be made in 1503, he states that Monalisa gave birth to an infant at the end of the same year
 ek italvi va america shodhakarta dwaara florence se praapt carch ke padri dwaara shishu ke namakaran kii dharmik rasm ke dastavejon ke hawaale se is baat kii pushti kii gai he
 Newland believes that Monalisa had made her portrait with the memory and research of the child in her stomach
 unka kathan he ki sansar main aane vaale naye jivan kaa romaanch va maatrutiv ko pulakit kar dene vaali prasannataa ke kaaran hi uske chehre par yah alaikik va adbhut muskaan he
 In another discovery, a teacher named Giuseve Pallati, a resident of Florence, made a revelation after scrutinizing all the city's ancient documents and records for 25 years, Lisa Gherardini was married in 1495 to Sir Francisco del Jacadain, a wealthy silk merchant
 san 1550 main purnajagaran kaaleen kalakaaron ke italy nivasee prasiddh jeevani lekhak georgio vasari dwaara resham vyapaaree kii patni lija gherardini kii tasviir ko mona lija naam diya gaya
 The word Mona in Italian is used for madam
 halaanki iske sadiyon baad tak bhi is kalakriti main chitrit is mahila ko uske anya prachlit naam lajiokande se bhi janaa jaataa rahaa he
 Like most of the art works of that time, the name of the woman giving the artist's signature, date and pose is not printed in this painting
 pallaanti ke anusaar liyanardo ke pita sar piyare va francisko ke ghar paraspar adhik duuri par nahin the, par donon hi pariwaron ke bich paraspar ghanishtha sambandh the
 At that time Lisa was 24 years old
 sadiyon se monalisa kii rahasyamay muskuraahat jahaan rahasy bani hui he vahiin german ke kala itihaaskaar sushri mike bogt-layaresan ne daawa kiya he ki tasviir main dikh rahi mahila italy ke arango praant ke diu kii patni ishabela he
 According to Ms
 Mike, Ishabella has a sad smile because her mother died shortly before Leonardo made the painting
 mike kii maane to ishabela kaa sharaabi pati nashe main dhut hokar use aksar martha-peethta tha
 In his published book 'who is Monalisa' Insarch has drawn many similarities
 pustak main aage likhaa he ki liyanardo jo ki diu ke darbar main shahi kalakaar the, isabela ke kaaphi nikat the
 About 8 years ago, a doctor of teeth in Japan surprised everyone by saying that the secret of Monalisa's mysterious smile is the break of the two front teeth in her upper jaw and that is why her upper lip was pressed on one side
 -this is visible, that is why one of his upper lips is seen as something suppressed from one side
 yahi kaaran he ki anjaane main monaalisa va rahasyamay muskaan dikhaai detii he jab ki vastav main yah muskaraahat nahin balki apane tut chuke daanton se khaali hue sthaan ko jeebh se hothon ko thelne kaa prayaas kar rahi he jisase hoth dabaa hua na dikhe

 In an article published in the journal Art and Antics, Ms
 Lillian claimed that she was stunned to see that Leonardo and Monalisa's faces, eyes, in 1518, when she placed a self-portrait of Leonardovinchi made of red chalk and a portrait of Monalisa
 There is a wonderful similarity between cheeks, nose and hair
 computer ke madad se jab monaalisa ke chehre ke upar liyanardo ke bal, dadhi va bhavahe lagaakar dekha gaya to vah puri tarah liyanardo main parivartit ho gai
 Conversely, if Lianardo's face is removed from his beard, hair, mustache, bhava, etc
, Leonardo turns into Monalisa
 sward ji kaa kathan he ki liyanardo ne monaalisa ke rup main swayan kaa nari chithran kiya he
 He cited the homosexuality of an artist as the main reason behind it
 is baat kii prabal sambhaavna he ki vinci samalangik ho or ubhay lingi vishyon ko kalakriti main dhaalane main ruchi rakhte ho tathaa apni isi pravitti ke chalate swayan ko nari rup main chitrit kar use monaalisa naam diya

 ye hindu dharm ke chaar pavithratam pramukh granthon main se ek he or aksar rugveda ke baad doosraa veda mana jaataa he - isamen rugveda ke 663 mantra paae jate hai
 Nevertheless, it is considered different from the Rigveda as the Yajurveda is primarily a prose book
 yajna main kahe jane vaale gadyatmak mantron ko ‘'yajus’' kaha jaataa he
 The Yajurveda scriptural mantras are derived from Agveda or Atharvaveda
 inamen swatantra padyatmak mantra bahut kam hai
 The Yajurveda has two branches: the Krishna Yajurveda practiced in South India and the Shukla Yajurveda branch practiced in North India
 jahaan rugveda kii rachana sapt-sindhu kshetra main hui thi vahiin yajurveda kii rachana kurukshetra ke pradesh main hui
 According to some people, its creation date from 1400 to 1000 BC
 Is considered to be
 yajus ke naam par hi veda kaa naam yajus+veda shabdon kii sandhi se bana he
 Yaj means surrender
 padaarth, karm, shraadh, yoga, indriya nigrah ityadi ke havan ko yajan yani samarpan kii kriya kaha gaya he
 Most of the rules and ordinances of yagyas and havens are in this Veda, so this book is ritualistic
 yajurveda kii samhitaayen lagbhag antim rachi gai samhitaayen thim, jo isa purv dwitiya sahasrabdi se pratham sahasrabdi ke aarambhik sadiyon main likhi gayi thi
 This book sheds light on the social and religious life of the Aryans

 In the Yajurveda Samhita, there is a collection of mantras to perform Yajna for performing ritual rituals of the Vedic period religion
 iname karmkand ke kai yagyon kaa vivaran haih About 663 mantras of the Rigveda are found in the Yajurveda
 yajurveda veda kaa ek aisa prabhag he, jo aaj bhi jan-jivan main apana sthaan kisi na kisi rup main banaaye huai he
 Most of the mantras of sacraments and sacrificial rituals belong to Yajurveda

 Yajurveda is divided into 5 branches- kaha jaataa he ki veda vyas ke shishy vaishampain ke 27 shishy the, inamen sabase pratibhashali the yajyavlky
 He once got enraged by the ignorance of his companions in the yajna
 is vivaad ke dekhakar vaishampain ne yajyavlky se apni sikhaai hui vidya waapas maangi
 On this, the angry Yajnavalkya vomited the Yajurveda - the particles of knowledge were mixed with the blood of Krishna Varna
 isse krishna yajurveda kaa janm hua
 Seeing this, other disciples became pheasants and devoured those grains and this gave birth to Taittriya Samhita

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga upanishad hindu dharm ke mahatvapurn shruti dharmagranth hai
 These are integral parts of Vedic hymns
 inamen parameshwar, paramatma-brahm or aatma ke swabhaav or sambandh kaa bahut hi darshanik or gyanpurvak varnan diya gaya he
 In the Upanishads, knowledge was given importance by calling rituals 'inferior' because knowledge leads from gross to subtle
 brahm, jeev or jagat kaa gyaan paanaa upanishdon kii mul shiksha he
 Together with the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahmasutra Upanishads, they are called the 'departures' of Vedanta
 upanishad hi samast bhartiya darshanon ke mul strot hai, chaahe wo veydant ho yaa sankhya yaa jain dharm yaa buddha dharm
 The Upanishads themselves have also been called Vedanta
 duniya ke kai darshanik upanishdon ko sabase behtareen gyaanakosh maanate hai
 The Upanishads are an invaluable asset to the world of Indian civilization
 mukhya upanishad 12 yaa 13 hai
 Each is associated with some Veda
 ye sanskrit main likhe gayi hai
 In the 17th century, Dara Shikoh translated many Upanishads into Persian
 19veen sadi main german tatvaveta shopenhavar or maxmooler ne in granthon main jo ruchi dikhalaakar inke anuwaad kiye vah sarvavidit hai or mananeey hai
 The word Upanishad simply means 'close upavasana' or 'sitting close by'
 yah shabd ‘up’, ‘ni’ upsarg tathaa, ‘sad’ dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Sad Dhatu has three meanings: the destruction of details; Movement or knowing and sediment-relaxation
 upanishad main rishi or shishy ke bich bahut sundar or good samvaad he jo pathak ko veda ke marm tak pahunchaata he
 The Upanishads are the foundation of Indian spiritual thought, the source of Indian spiritual philosophy
 ve brahmavidya hai
 There are answers discovered by the sages of curiosities
 ve chintansheel rishiyon kii gyancharchaaon kaa saar hai
 They are poetic metaphysical creations of poet-hearted sages, attempts to discover the unknown, attempts to tie the indescribable superpower into words, and are written accounts of that formless, formless, boundless, inexhaustible desire to understand and define the inscrutable 
 vaidic yug sansaarik anand evam upbhog kaa yug tha
 It was an era of the piety, purity, sentimentality, naivete and sinlessness of the human mind
 jivan ko sampurna allhadpan se jeena hi us kaal ke logon kaa prey va shrey tha
 Seeing the various beautiful forms of nature, the emotions that emerged in the passionate minds of the people of that time in the form of spontaneous illumination waves, he termed them as prashas, praises, divine songs and poetic works and became Vedic rites or mantras
 un logon ke man sansaarik anand se bhare the, sampannataa se santusht the, prakritik divyataaon se bhav-vibhor ho uthte the
 Therefore, the desire in his songs is that this joy should always remain, grow and never end
 unhone kaamana kii ki is anand ko ham purna aayu sau varshon tak bhogen or hamaare baad kii peedhiyaan bhi isi prakaar trupt rahen
 Not only this, it was also wished that at the end of this life we should go to heaven and the continuation of this happiness and bliss should remain there too
 is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye vibhinn anushthan bhi kiye gaye or devataaon ko prasann karne ke aayojan karke unase ye vardaan bhi maange gaye
 When nature took a turn, natural calamities were encountered
 tab un vipattiyon kekaalpanik niyantrak devataaon yatha marut, agni, rudra aadi ko tusht va prasann karne ke anushthan kiye jate the or unase prarthana kii jaati thi ki aisi vipattiyon ko aane na den or unke aane par praja kii raksha karen
 Overall, the lives of the people of the Vedic period were cheerful, eloquent, well-meaning, optimistic, and lively
 unamem vishaad, paap yaa kshtmay jivan ke vichaar kii chaaya nahin thi
 Hell and the tortures found in it were not even imagined
 karm ko yajna or yajna ko hi karm mana gaya tha or usee ke sabhi sukhon kii prapti tathaa sankaton kaa nivaaran ho jane kii avadharana thi
 This lifestyle lasted for a long time
 par aisa kab tak chalata
 One day or the other, this curiosity had to arise in the infinitely inquisitive mind of man and never satisfied with the present, who is the creator behind this huge amphitheater of nature, who is its creator / creator, its origin
 Where is it, who are we, where have we come from, where will this creation eventually go
 hamaara kya hoga? shanai:-shanai: ye prashn ankurit hue
 And then began the quest to find answers to all this and the endless search journey of the curious mind-brain
 aisa nahin he ki aatma, punarjanm or karmfalwaad ke vishay main vaidic rishiyon ne kabhi sochaa hi nahin tha
 It was not that he did not care about this life
 rishiyon ne yada-kada is vishay par vichaar kiya bhi tha
 Its seeds are found here and there in the Vedas, but this was just a thought
 koi chintaa yaa bhay nahin
 The soul is a different element than the body, and after the end of this life, it goes to the other world, this principle is definitely found in the Vedic hymns, but the Vedic sages did not appear in the search for why the soul travels in the world
 apni samast simaaon ke saath sansaarik jivan vaidic rishiyon kaa prey tha
 The fear of leaving Preya and moving towards the credit arose at the time of the Upanishads, then the life of life in front of salvation was destroyed and when people instead of enjoying life started turning away from it and taking sannyas
 haan, yah bhi hua ki vaidic rishi jahaan yah puch kar shant ho jate the ki 'yah sristi kisne banaai he?' or 'koun devtaa he jisaki ham upasna karen'? vahaan upanishdon ke rishiyon ne sristi banane vaale ke sambandh main kuch siddhanton kaa nishchay kar diya or us 'sat' kaa bhi pataa paa liya jo puja or upasna kaa vastut: adhikaar he
 Vedas and new narratives of Vedic religion are Upanishads
 'vedon main yajna-dharm kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya or logon ko yah sikh di gai ki is jivan main sukhi, sampann tathaa sarvatra safal va vijayi rahane ke liye aavashyak he ki devataaon kii tushti va prasannataa ke liye yajna kiye jaaen
 Yajna is the place of origin of the world
 sabhi karmon main shreshth karm yajna he
 Heaven is attained by the results of the yajna
 ' ye hi sutara chaaron ore gunjit the
 Secondly, when the Brahmin texts gave great importance to the yajna and the arbitrariness of the priests and the priests increased immensely, then there was a reaction against this system and the spirit of protest was initiated
 log sochane lage ki 'yagyon kaa vaastavik arth kya he?' 'unke bheetar koun sa rahasy he?' 've dharm ke kis rup ke pratik hai?' 'kya ve hamen jivan ke charam lakshya tak pahunchaa denge?' is prakaar, karmkand par bahut adhik jor tathaa karmkandon ko hi jivan kii sabhi samasyaon ke hal ke rup main pratipaadit kiye jane kii pravriti ne vichaarvaan logon ko unke bare main punarvichaar karne ko prerit kiya
 The Vedic Aryans became polytheists while imagining a controlling deity in every form of nature
 unke devataaon main ullekhneey hai- indra, varun, agni, savita, som, ashvinikumar, marut, pushan, mitra, pitar, yama aadi
 Then an intellectual anxiety began to see that one superpower or to understand its true nature, which is the creator of the entire creation and the authority over these gods
 is vyagrata ne upanishad ke chintanon kaa maarg prashast kiya
 The Upanishads are philosophical poetic compositions of contemplative and imaginative mystics
 jahaan gadhy likh gaye hai ve bhi padyamay gadhy-rachanaaon main aisi shabd-shakti, dhvanyaatmakataa, lav evam arthgarbhita he ki ve kisi daivi shakti kii rachanaaon kaa abhas dete hai
 It is not really an exaggeration that he was called 'mantra' or 'richa'
 vastav main mantra yaa richa kaa sambandh veda se he parantu upanishdon kii hamatta darshane ke liye in sangyaaon kaa upyog yahan bhi katipay vidwaanon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The Upanishads are an attempt to peek behind the visible world around them
 iske liye na koi upkaran uplabdh hai or na kisi prakaar kii prayog-anusandhan suvidhaayen sambhav he
 Spiritual pulsation or divine light based on your mindset, mental experience or insight is the basis of the description
 upanishad aadhyaatmavidya ke vividh adhyay hai jo vibhinn ant:prerit rishiyon dwaara likhe gaye hai
 These include various metaphors and symbols describing the nature of the world, its location, its relationship with various natural powers, the glimpse of a ray in the human soul or the presence of a subtle reflection, etc
 sristi ke udgam evam uski rachana ke sambandh main gahan chintan tathaa swayanfoort kalpana se upje roopankan ko vividh bimbon or pratikon ke madhyam se prastut karne kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 In the end it was said that this is what we can understand based on our best hypothesis
 iske aage is rahasy ko shaayad paramatma hi jaanata ho or 'shaayad vah bhi nahin jaanata ho
 ' sankshep main, vedon main is sansar main drishyman evam prakat prakritik shaktiyon ke swaroop ko samajhane, unhen apni kalpanaanusaar vibhinn devataaon kaa jama pahanaakar unki aradhana karne, unhen tusht karne tathaa unase sansaarik safalataa va sampannataa evam suraksha paane ke praytn kiye gaye the
 Yagyas were created to convey their reverence to them
 upanishdon main un anek prayatnon kaa vivaran he jo in prakritik shaktiyon ke peeche kii paramashkti yaa sristi kii sarvocch satta se saakshaatkaar karne kii manokamana ke saath kiye gaye
 He tried his best to reach as far as human imagination, thinking ability, insight ability could reach the philosophers, mystics or sages of that time
 yahi unka tap tha
 The Veda has four parts - Samhita, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishads
 upanishad main aatm or anatm tattvon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he jo veda ke moulik rahasyon kaa pratipaadan karata he
 Often, the Upanishads come at the end of the Veda
 isliye ye veydant ke naam se bhi prakhyat hai
 The three major texts which authenticate the fundamental principles of Vedic religion, which are known by the name of Prasthanatrayi, are the Upanishads, Brahmasutra and Srimadbhagavadgita
 upanishad brahm vidya kaa dyotak he
 It is said that the practice of this knowledge destroys the ignorance of Mummukhujan; She makes Brahma attain; Due to which, the sorrows of human beings etc
, worldly sorrows are completely relaxed
 falat: upanishad ve ‘tatva’ pratipadak granth maane jate hai jinke abhyaas se manushya ko brahm athwa paramatma kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 The 108 Upanishads are divided into the following categories- rigvedic -- 10 upanishad Shukla Yajurveda - 19 Upanishads krishna yajurvedic -- 32 upanishad Samavedayya - 16 Upanishads atharvavedic -- 31 upanishad Total - 108 Upanishads inke atirikt narayan, nrisingh, ramtapani tathaa gopal chaar upanishad or hai

 He is considered the father of the Archaeological Survey of India Department
 inke donon bhrata fransis kaningham evam joseph kaningham bhi apane yogadanon ke liye british bharat main prasiddh hue the
 He held several high positions in the English Army in India and retired from the rank of Major General in 1861 AD
 inhen inke yogadanon ke liye 20 may, 1870 ko order of star of india se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Later in 1878 he was also awarded the Order of Indian Empire

 He held this position till 1885

 Through the discovery of ancient places and collection of records and coins, he collected valuable material for researching the history of Indian past and paved the way for scholars to work in this direction

 For example, Cunningham's view of Kaushambi's perception that this city was situated at the place where the present Kausum is, the same opinion has been accepted today in light of the discoveries of archeology

 are studied

 Military science is that branch of knowledge in which military ideology, organization materials and skills are studied in a social context
 adikaal se hi yuddh kii parampara chali aa rahi he
 The history of mankind is incomplete without the study of war and the history of war is as old as the story of mankind
 yuddh maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas ke pramukh kaarnon main se ek hai
 The rise and destruction of many civilizations took place, but the war never ended
 jaise-jaise sabhyataa kaa vikaas hua vaise-vaise naveen hathiyaaron ke nirmaan ke falswaroop yuddh ke swaroop main parivartan avashya aayaa he
 Under military science, techniques related to war and armed conflict, psychology and methodology etc
 are studied
 sainya vigyaan ke nimnlikhit chah mukhya shakhayein hai: In ancient India, military science was studied and taught as an essential part of state and knowledge
 mauryaal ke baad dhire-dhire rajya kii suraksha kii jimmedaari puri tarah se sainikon par avalambit ho gai, saamaanya naagarik yuddh ko mook darshak kii tarah dekhtaa rahaa or uske liye raksha vigyaan maatr kautuhal kaa vishay ban kar rah gai
 As a result, India was a slave to invaders and foreigners for centuries
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan bhartiya sena britain kii taraf se duniya ke kai hisson main sangram main bhaag liya
 In addition to increasing military recruitment, Indians were also given higher commissions in the army during that period, with the aim of increasing war demand and sustainable supply
 saath hi nagarikon main sena evam yuddh ke prati jaagarukta evam abhiruchi paidaa karne ke uddeshy se pachaas ke dashak main bharat ke kuch vishvavidhyalayon main sainya vigyaan yaa yuddh adhyayan ke naam se is vishay kaa adhyayan-adhyaapan prarambh kii gai
 However, before 2500 years ago, in Takkshila, a center of world-renowned education in India, the method of teaching of warfare, military organization and weapons was studied
 vidhyaarthee kaa adhyayan suraksha adhyayan ke bina purna nahin hota tha
 Kautilya's Arthashastra, as detailed in the context of war and its operations, proves this fact itself
 adikaal se hi yuddh kii parampara chali aa rahi he
 The history of mankind is incomplete without the study of war and the history of war is as old as the story of mankind
 yuddh maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas ke pramukh kaarnon main se ek hai
 The rise and destruction of many civilizations took place, but the war never ended
 jaise-jaise sabhyataa kaa vikaas hua vaise-vaise naveen hathiyaaron ke nirmaan ke falswaroop yuddh ke swaroop main parivartan avashya aayaa he
 Military science, as the name suggests, is made up of the words 'army' and 'science'
 sena ek aisa susangathit dal he jiskaa kaary ladaai karnaa he or vigyaan se abhipraay kisi gyaan ko is prakaar krambaddh kar liya jaataa he jisase ki uskaa vidhipurvak adhyayan kiya ja sake
 Thus, the name of a team formed by a state or a well organized society to fight is army and the order of knowledge related to that army is military science
 kisi bhi vishay ko paribhaasha ke parcote main baandhna aasaan nahin he
 Due to the vast field of military science and being interdisciplinary, no definite definition has been given
 phir bhi kuch manishiyon kii sainya vigyaan se sambandhit nimna paribhaasha he- Captain B

 According to Maliwal, "military science is that branch of knowledge in which military ideology, organization materials and skills are studied in a social context
 ’’ According to Prof
 Ram Avatar, "the subject of military science gives us the knowledge of the war-craft, ie, the tools of war and the war style and the impact it has on society and the war style of social changes
 ’’ Major R
C
 According to Kulshrestha, "military science is that branch of human knowledge which has been considered important for establishing social peace and protecting private sovereignty from external aggression since the early period, under it peacekeeping tools, army organization, The use and development of weapons, war styles are studied from a mental, social, economic and political point of view
 ’’ According to Prof
 M
P
 Samre, "military science is the science of strategy, economics and administration
" ’’ All the above definitions make us realize that military science is a social subject which gives us information about the causes, methods, means of wars in society
 kisi bhi vishay ke kshetra kaa abhas uski paribhaasha se ho jaataa he
 All things related to war and military are studied in military science
 samay or yug ke parivartan ke saath-saath yuddh kii prakriyaaon main parivartan aata chalaa jaataa he, isi ke saath sainik sanghathan, uske prashikshan, shastrastron main bhi parivartan aata chalaa gaya, vaise hi sainya vigyaan ke kshetra main bhi parivartan aata gaya
 In modern times, scientific advances and inventions have expanded and broadened the field of war
 vigyaan se abhipraay kisi bhi vishay ke niyamanusaar adhyayan se he is drushti se sainya vigyaan vishay ko vigyaan kii kasuti main ksaa jaay to puri tarah se khara utarataa he, kyonki iske antargat sena ke sanghathan, shastrastra, yudhkala kutayojana, prabandh evam samartantra aadi kaa kramik adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Just as there are some principles and rules of science and if action is taken on the basis of them, then the objective is achieved according to that rule
 isi prakaar se sainya vigyaan ke antargat yuddh ke anek siddhanth hai jinke paalan karne se uddeshy kii prapti avashyambhavi hoti he
 Or science says those subjects whose truth can be tested in laboratories and those rules which are eternal and true and art are those subjects whose truth of rules cannot be tested with certainty
 vigyaan hamen kisi vastu ke vishay main gyaan detaa he or kala us kaary ko karnaa sikhaati he
 From this point of view knowledge about warfare, army, military organization, training, weapons, war moves etc
 is necessary, military science is science and military science is also art as far as military training and military exercises are concerned
 Makers of Modern Strategy main likhaa he ki yuddh kaa koi vigyaan nahin hota na hoga hi
 War is related to many types of sciences, but war has no science of its own
 yah to vyavhaarik kala or kaushal he
 In this context, the statement of famous military expert Clausewitz is remarkable
 donon hi pakshon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki sainya vigyaan, vigyaan evam kala donon ke antargat aata he, parantu anubhav, adhyayan kii apekshaakrit adhik shaktishaalee paksh prathit hota he
 Being a branch of military science knowledge, it is natural and necessary to have a relationship with other branches
 bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa pratyaksh prabhaav sainik yojanaon, shastrastron, sankriyaaon, saaj-sajja evam samaratantrik chaalon par padataa he
 This is the reason that every nation has to adopt security system according to its geographical conditions
 is sandarbh main prasiddh british general vavel kaa kahana he ki- kisi sthaan kaa bhugol hi vahaan hone vaali ladaaiyon ke swaroop ko sunishchit karata he
 Ignoring geographical facts, no army can win a war
 itihaas se hamen maanav jati kii samskruti evam sabhyataa se sambandhit samast jaankaree milti he jiske abhaav main yudhon kaa adhyayan adhuraa hi he
 The analysis of victory and defeat of past wars is the basis of present and future wars
 yuddh ke devtaa ke naam se vikhyath prasiddh senapati nepolian bonapart kaa kathan he ki- mahaan senanayakon ke abhiyaanon kaa baar-baar adhyayan evam manan karo, unhen apana adarsh banaao
 This is the secret of knowing the differences of martial arts and becoming a great general
 dhan ke bina sainya sanghathan sambhav nahin he
 Economically, it is also difficult for a strong nation to develop its military because the number of the army and the type of armed forces, the appropriate military plan, etc
 are completely based on the economic sources of the particular nation
 karl marks ke anusaar, ‘‘kisi yug ke sampoorn saamaajik jivan ke swaroop kaa nishchay aarthik paristhitiyaan hi karti he
 Modern warfare is very expensive and it is very difficult to supply the strategic needs
 suntaju ne likhaa he yuddh rajya kaa ek aavashyak ang he ore shuman bhi kehete hai ki yuddh rajya shakti kaa antim hathiyaar he
 In this context, the famous German military expert Clausewitz's statement that the state resorts to war to implement its policies
 aaj yuddh kii prakruti badal gai he desh ke prayek naagarik ko pratyaksh athwa apratyaksh dhang se yuddh main yogadan karnaa hota he
 The army is a type of social organization in which mental elements such as discipline, morale, leadership, courage, fear, propaganda, patriotic spirit, concern, psychosis are very important
 aaj ke yuddh manovaigyanik yuddh hote he jisamen vaastavik ladaai ke pehle hi shatru ke yauddhik maansikta kaa vighatan karnaa hota he
 Hitler's statement shows the deep connection between military science and psychology that the actual battle is fought before a shot is fired
 is sambandh main kautilya ne kaha he ki, ‘‘ek dhanushadhari ke dhanush se choda hua baan sambhav he kisi ek bhi sainik ko na maare, parantu budhimaan vyakti ke dwaara kiya gaya buddhi kaa prayog garbh sthit praaniyon ko bhi nasht kar detaa he
 If science and technology have the greatest impact in any one area of life, then it is the military field
 maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas main pachaas pratishat se adhik khojon kaa uddeshy sainik aavashyaktaa rahi he
 Modern scientific and technological development is behind the concept of non-conventional and total war
 aanvik shastrastron evam prakshepastron ke sanhaarak kshamta ke sandarbh main prasiddh vaigyanik oinstin ne likhaa he ki, ‘‘main nahin jaanata ki tritiy vishwayuddh main kin-kin hathiyaaron kaa istemaal hoga? kintu main nishchit rup se yah bataa saktaa hum ki chaturth vishwa yuddh main kin hathiyaar kaa istemaal hoga, arthath pathar
 This statement reflects the crisis created by human use of modern technology
 yuddh main safalataa praapt karne ke liye vifaille rasayanon kaa prayog pracheen kaal se hi hota aa rahaa he
 The Atharvaveda, Markandeya Purana, Vishnudharmottara Purana, Shukraniti Shastra, Panchatantra, Kautilya Arthashastra, Manusmriti and Vrihata Samhita etc
 texts mention many types of weapons by which to make fire in the battlefield, pouring rain, thunder of clouds, from all around
 Creating darkness etc
 was done
 aadhunik yuddh main dhuna failaane vaali, dam ghotane vaali, ankhon main jalan paidaa karne vaali, twachaa ko jalaane vaali jaise kai prakaar ke vifaille rasayanon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Due to which chemical warfare is born
 jaivik karkon ke dwaara shatru ke bhojan, pani evam khaadya saamagree ko vishakt karke uske swasthya ko kamjor kar uske yuddh karne kii maansik shakti kaa vighatan karne kii har sambhav koshish kii jaati he
 Bacteria of various types of diseases are transmitted to the enemy by various means
 vifaille jeevanuon se utpann rog se keval sainik hi prabhavit nahin hote apitu nagarikon par bhi iskaa baraabar asar hone ke kaaran shatru kaa manobal gir jaataa he jisase uski sainik samarthy par vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Apart from the subjects mentioned above, military science has a deep relation with other subjects like computer science, social science etc
 pracheen yuddh simit hote the jinka sambandh keval senaaon evam senapatiyon tak hota tha, aam janata kii yudhon ke prati koi vishesh ruchi nahin hoti thi
 As the civilization developed, the forms of wars also changed and today war has assumed the shape of complete war
 aadhunik yuddh sampoorn raashtra kii pariksha he
 The utility of the subject of military science can be outlined as follows- sainya vigyaan vishay ko suraksha adhyayan, raksha evam suraksha adhyayan, raksha evam straatejic adhyayan, suraksha evam yuddh adhyayan naam se bhi adhyayan-adhyaapan kiya jaataa he
 Significantly, defense studies, called Defense Studies, War Studies, Military Science and Strategic Studies, are conducted in India
 is vishay ke mahatv kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki duniya ke kai pramukh deshon main dephence studies kii padhai skool, college or vishvavidhyalay staron par hoti he
 After doing a related course, all the options for the job are coming up
 dephence va stratsic studies ko military / dephence studies, military science, war and neshnal security studies, war and stratsic studies ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Seeing its importance, former Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh laid the foundation stone of Indian National Defense University at Binola, Gurgaon, Haryana on 23 May 2013
 prastaavit bhartiya rashtriya raksha vishvidhyalay 200 acre se adhik bhoomi par sthit hoga
 It will start functioning fully in 2018
 naksalwad, aatankwaad, ugravad, bhashavad, sampradayikta, pradeshikta, jan-jatiy vidroh jaise samasyaon kaa hal sainik madhyam se nahin nikaala ja saktaa na hi isse ye sabhi samasyayen samaapt hone vaali hai or na hi shaanti evam suraksha kii sthapana kii ja sakati he
 For this, it is necessary to create an atmosphere of trust
 uparyukt samasyaon kii tah tak jaakar mul kaarnon ke taarkik evam vyavhaarik upaay dhundne se hoga
 Military science elaborates on the causes, effects and remedies of internal and external security problems
 jiske vartmaan sandarbh main adhyayan kii nitant aavashyaktaa he
 The famous military thinker Lydil Hart has said that - if you want peace, understand war
 vishwa main yuddh ke rokthaam ke liye sabase aavashyak he yuddh ke kaaran, prabhaav evam parinaam par gahan chintan, manan evam charchaa karne kii
 Study of this subject also provides active support in preventing world destruction
 aaj vishwa ke paas itane ghaatak evam vinaashak hathiyaar hai ki samast prithvi ko hajaaro baar nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Modern warfare is a total war and in which non-conventional war style weapons can be used and the center of war can be both military and civilian bases
 rankshetra main morcha samhaal rahe sainikon ke liye sambhav nahin ki itani badi aabaadi kii har jagah madad kii ja sake
 Therefore, detailed information about the measures of civil defense can be obtained through military science
 kisi bhi rajya ke liye yuddh kii vittiya aavashyaktaaon kii purti karnaa behad kathin kaary he
 Therefore, during the wartime, the government takes assistance like donations, donations and loans from the public
 sainya vigyaan yuddh par sampoorn prakaash daalata he evam vidhyaarthee ko isaki gahari samaj pradaan kar jimmedaar naagarik bana saktaa hai
 What are our duties towards the country through military science and how should we protect the motherland by staying in the society and get an opportunity to present ourselves as an ideal soldier
 aaj kaa vidhyaarthee kal kaa jimmedaar naagarik athwa sainik banakar suraksha hit ke muddon ko gaharaai se samaj saktaa he
 There are a lot of career prospects in this field
 yah aapako ek desh se duusare desh ke saath vaishvik maamle sambandh aadi kii jaankaree detaa he
 After taking a course in this field, you can become a socio-economic specialist, a researcher in the international field
 iske saath hi aap indian navy, air force, dephence jarnalism main indian army officer, indian dephence officer, ground duty officer, research officer, military officer ban sakate hai
 Candidates pursuing Bachelors or Masters degrees in Defense and Strategic Studies can work as Lecturers, College Professors, University Professors or do research in International Relations, Geopolitical Affairs of War, Geopolitical Affairs, socio-economic and Strategic Areas
 Huh
 iske alaava rojgaar ke avasar mukhya taur par bhartiya sena, vaayu sena, nausena, ajukeshan korporations, dephence jarnalism main maujuud hai
 If you have obtained a master's degree in this field, then you can write articles about national security in newspapers, magazines etc
 yuddh sanchaalan kii paddati or prakriya ab raajnneetigyon kaa mukhya vishay ban gaya he, kyonki sabase bade astr arthath aanvik hathiyaaron kaa niyantran evam prayog raajnneetigyon ke haath main he na ki senanayakon ke
 a student of military science can show an efficient leadership ability by having sufficient knowledge in military matters beforehand
 kyonki aaj ki sabase badi vidmbana raajnneetigyon kaa sainya gyaan kii samaj kaa abhaav he

 mohammad bin tululaq dilli sultanate main tululaq vansh kaa shaasha tha
 After the death of Ghayasuddin Tughlaq, his son 'juna Khan' as the name of Muhammad bin Tughlaq sat on the throne of Delhi
 iskaa mul naam 'ulug khaan' tha
 Muhammad Tughlaq has been called the Khan of the world in an inscription of Rajahmundry
 sambhavtah madhyakaalin sabhi sultaanon main mohammad tululaq sarvaadhik shikshit, vidwaan evam yogya vyakti tha
 It has been called 'dreamy', 'mad' and 'rakh-pipasu' due to its whimsical schemes, cruel acts and feeling of disregard for other's happiness and sorrow
 barani, sarhindi, nizamuddin, badayunni evam farishta jaise itihaaskaaron ne sultan ko adharmee ghoshit kiya gaya he
 After sitting on the throne, Tughlaq gave various titles and positions to the rich and the chieftains
 usne tartar khaan ko 'baharaam khaan' kii oopaadhi, malik qabool ko 'imaad-ul-mulk' kii oopaadhi evam 'vazeer-e-mumalik' kaa pad diya tha, par kaalaantar main use 'kaanejahaan' kii oopaadhi ke saath gujarat kaa haaqim banaaya gaya
 He conferred the title of 'shahna-e-bhawan' with the title of Khwaja Jahan to Malik Aruyaz, the title of 'lawyer-e-dar' to Maulana Ghayasuddin with the title of 'qutulug Khan', to his cousin Firoz Shah Tughlaq as 'naib' The position of 'barbak' was conferred
 mohammad bin tululaq dilli ke sabhi sultaanon main sarvaadhik kushagra, buddhi sampann, dharm-nirepaksh, kala-premi evam anbhavi senapati tha
 He was proficient in Arabic language and Persian language and in astronomy, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, science, logic etc
 allaudin kilji kii bhanti apane shashan kaal ke prarambh main usne, na to caliph se apane pad kii sweekruti lee or na ulema varg kaa sahyog liya, yadhyapi baad main aisa karnaa padaa
 He ended the monopoly of the Ulama class over the Department of Justice
 qaazi ke jis faisle se vah santusht nahin hota tha, use badal detaa tha
 First of all, Muhammad Tughluq allocated the posts on the basis of merit without any discrimination
 nasl or varg-vibhed ko samaapt karke yogyata ke aadhaar par adhikariyon ko niyukt karne kii niti apanaayi
 In fact, it was the misfortune of that ruler that his plans were not executed successfully
 jiske kaaran yah itihaaskaaron kii aalochana kaa paatr bana
 While sitting on the throne of Muhammad Tughlaq, the Delhi Sultanate was divided into a total of 23 provinces, the main ones of which were Delhi, Devgiri, Lahore, Multan, Sarmuti, Gujarat, Awadh, Kannauj, Lakhnauti, Bihar, Malwa, Jajnagar, Dvarasamudra etc
 kashmir evam baluchistan bhi dilli sultanate main shaamil the
 The extent of the Delhi Sultanate was extended during this reign
 parantu isaki krur niti ke kaaran rajya main vidroh armbh ho gaya
 As a result, a new independent state was established in the south and these regions were separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal bhi swatantra ho gaya
 After the ascension, Muhammad Tughlaq tried to make some new plans and implement them
 jaise - Through his first plan, Muhammad Tughlaq increased the tax in the fertile region of Doab, but in the same year there was a severe famine in Doab, which affected the yield
 tululaq ke adhikariyon dwaara jabaran kar vasuulne se us kshetra main vidroh ho gaya, jisase tululaq kii yah yojana asafal rahi
 Muhammad Tughlaq established a new department called 'diwan-e-amir Kohi' for the development of agriculture
 sarkari karmchaariyon ke bhrashtachar, kisaanon kii udaseenta, bhoomi kaa acha na hona ityadi kaarnon se krishi unnati sambandhi apni yojana ko teen varsh pashchaat samaapt kar diya
 Muhammad bin Tughlaq provided loans to farmers at very low interest
 tululaq ne apni duusari yojana ke antargat rajdhani ko dilli se devgiri sthaanantarit kiya
 Devagiri was also called "kuvvatul Islam"
 sultan qutubuddin mubarak kilji ne devgiri kaa naam 'qutubabad' rakhaa tha or mohammad bin tululaq ne iskaa naam badalakar daulatabad kar diya
 The Sultan was most criticized for this plan
 mohammad tululaq dwaara rajdhani parivartan ke kaarnon par itihaaskaaron main bada vivaad he, phir bhi nishkarshtah kaha ja saktaa he ki, devgiri kaa dilli sultanate ke madhya sthit hona, mongol akramanakariyon ke bhay se surakshit rahanaa, dakshin-bharat kii sampannataa kii ore khinchaav aadi aise kaaran the, jinke kaaran sultan ne rajdhani parivartit karne kii baat sochi
 This plan of Muhammad Tughlaq also failed completely and he allowed people from Daulatabad to return to Delhi in 1335 AD
 rajdhani parivartan ke parinamswaroop dakshin main muslim samskruti kaa vikaas hua, jisane antat bahamani samrajya ke udai kaa maarg kholaa
 Anubhav Maurya teesri yojana ke antargat mohammad tululaq ne sankethik va pratikatmak sikkon kaa prachlan karavaaya
 Due to various coinage experiments, Edward Thomas called him the 'prince of the Wealthy'
 mohammad tululaq ne 'dokani' naamak sikke kaa prachlan karavaaya
 According to Barani, probably due to the vacancy of the treasury and the success of the policy of expansion of his empire, the sultan got the sign currency introduced
 sankethik mudra ke antargat sultan ne sambhawatah pital or tamba dhaatuon ke sikke chalaaye, jiskaa mulya chaandi ke rupee taka ke baraabar hota tha
 Due to lack of state control over coinage, many fake mints were made
 lagaan jaali sikke se diya jane laga, jisase arthvyavastha thapp ho gai
 Inspiration for running sign currency came from China and Iran
 vahaan ke shaskaon ne in yojanaon ko safaltaapurvak chalaaya, jabaki mohammad tululaq kaa prayog vifal rahaa
 The Sultan suffered terrible financial losses on the failure of his plan
 chauthi yojana ke antargat mohammad tululaq ke khurasaan evam karachil vijay abhiyaan kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 In order to conquer Khorasan, Muhammad Tughlaq gave a salary of one year in advance to a large army of 3,70,000 soldiers, but due to political change the two countries reached a compromise, which failed the Sultan's plan and financially hurt him
 Had to lift
 karachil abhiyaan ke antargat sultan ne khusro malik ke netritv main ek vishaal sena ko pahari rajyon ko jeetne ke liye bheja
 His entire army wandered in the wild paths, according to Ibn Battuta, ultimately only ten officers could survive and return
 is prakaar mohammad tululaq kii yah yojana bhi asafal rahi
 Probably between 1328-29 AD, the Mongol invader Tarmasharin Chagtai invaded India with a huge army and trampled the territories from Multan, Lahore to Delhi
 aisa mana jaataa he ki, sultan mohammad tululaq ne mongol netaa ko ghoose dekar waapas kar diya tha ye bhi smbhv he ki mongol netaa ne sultan ko dilli sltant ko khud hi ythasthiti kamazor karne va isi tarah mongol shasn ke liye zmin tyaar karne ke liye ghoose di
 Whatever happened between them, the Sultan was subjected to criticism due to this compromise policy towards the Mongol leader
 ye sahi he ki iske baad phir kabhi mohammad tululaq ke samay main bharat par mongol akraman nahin hua or ye bhi ki apni mahattvakankshi asafal yojanaon ke kaaran mohammad tululaq ko ‘asafalataaon kaa badshaah’ kaha jaataa he
 Most revolts took place during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, of which 27 revolts took place in South India alone
 sultan mohammad tululaq ke shashan kaal main hue kuch mahatvapurn vidrohon kaa saransh nimnlikhit hai-pratham vidroh 1327 i

 In 1333 AD, the African traveler Ibn Battuta was sent by Muhammad to China as his ambassador
 ebn batuta ne apni pustak ‘rehala’ main mohammad tululaq ke samay kii ghatnaon kaa varnan kiya he
 Muhammad Tughluq was tolerant religiously
 jain vidwaan evam sant 'jinaprabhu suri' ko darbar main bulaakar sammaan pradaan kiya
 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was the first Sultan of Delhi Sultanate, who participated in Hindu festivals
 dilli ke prasiddh sufi sheikh 'shihabuddin' ko 'dewan-e-mustakhraj' niyukt kiya tathaa sheikh 'muijuddin' ko gujarat kaa garvanar tathaa 'syed kalamuddin amir kirmani' ko sena main niyukt kiya
 Sheikh 'nizamuddin chirag-e-delhi' was one of the Sultan's opponents
 apane shashan kaal ke antim samay main jab sultan mohammad tululaq gujarat main vidroh ko kuchal kar targi ko samaapt karne ke liye sindh kii ore badha, to maarg main thatta ke nikat gondal pahunchakar vah gambhir rup se biimaar ho gaya
 The Sultan died here on 20 March 1351
 uske marane ke par itihaaskaar barani ne kaha ki, “sultan ko uski praja se or praja ko apane sultan se mukti mil gai
 "isami has described Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq as opposed to the religion of Islam
 dow ishwari prasad ne uske bare main kaha he ki, “madhya yug main rajmukut dhaaran karne waalon main mohammad tululaq, nihsandeh yogya vyakti tha
 After the establishment of Muslim rule, he was the most learned and cultured ruler among the rulers who embellished the throne of Delhi
 ” usne apane sikkon par “al sultan jilli allaah”, “sultan ishwar kii chaaya”, sultan ishwar kaa samarthak he, aadi vaakya ko ankit karavaaya
 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was also a good poet and music lover
 mansaar shilpashaastra shilpashaastra kaa pracheen granth he jiske rachayita mansaar hai
 Its 43rd chapter describes many such chariots that used to reach the goal by walking through air

 Shri Prasanna Kumar Acharya painstakingly reconstructed the Mansar Craftsmanship and translated it into English language
 yah granth saat bhaagon main prakashit kiya gaya
 Mansar craftsmanship begins with the praise of Brahma, the creator of the universe
 yah granth shiv ke tisare netra ke khulne par samaapt hota he
 It has about 70 chapters, out of which the first eight chapters are organized in one section

 The contents of chapter 51 to chapter 70 can be broadly divided into two parts - one group from chapter 51 to chapter 65 and another group from chapter 66 to chapter 70
 arthshaastra ke sandarbh main utpaadan ke ghatakon ke aapurtikartaaon ko waapas milane vaala dhan pratifal kehalaata he
 For example, if someone invests capital in an industry, then the money received in lieu of that capital is the result of that investment
 nabhikeey aapurtikarta samooh ) bahut se deshon kaa ek samooh he jo nabhikeey nirastrikaran ke liye prayasarat he
 For this purpose, this group controls the export and transfer of nuclear weapon-able material
 iskaa vaastavik lakshya yah he ki jin deshon ke paas nabhikeey kshamta nahin he ve ise arjeet na kar saken
 The group prohibits the export of nuclear equipment, materials and technologies that are to be used in the making of nuclear weapons and thus prevents nuclear proliferation

 The flying Spaghetti demon is the god of Pastafari religion
 ise america ke sarkari vidyalayon main intellegent dizine or crieshnism padhaane kaa virodh karne ke liye san 2005 main banaaya gaya tha
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki is dharm ke anuyaayi ise ek asli dharm bataate hai, par media main ise ek vyangy dharm kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 The first description of the flying Spaghetti monster is found in a satirical letter written in 2005 by Bobby Henderson to the Board of Education of the State of Kansas, USA
 is chitthee se ve board dwaara vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas ke sthaan par intellegent dizine padhaane kii anumati die jane kaa virodh kar rahe the
 In the letter, he satirizes Creationism by asserting his faith in a deity that looks like spaghetti and meatballs and the creator of the universe
 ve tark karte hai ki unki dharanaayen intellegent dizine kii dharanaon ke jitani vaid hai, or kehete hai ki isliye unki dharanaon ko vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas or intellegent dizine ke baraabar samay milanaa chahie
 The flying Spaghetti demon is often used as a contemporary adaptation of Russell's teapot due to its popularity and reach
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although Henderson states that "the same religion is allowed in Pastafari religion - disallowance of religious beliefs", yet Pastafari people hold some beliefs
 pastafaari srijan myth ke anusaar ek adrishy or anbhigyeya udanevaale spagetti daanav ne bahut zyada sharaab pine ke baad brahmand kii rachana das hajaar varsh pehle kii thi
 According to these beliefs, the reason for the Earth to be flawed is the drunkenness of this demon during creation
 pastafaari ye bhi maanate hai ki kram-vikaas ke sabhi saboot pastafaariyon kii shraddha jaanchane ke liye swayan udanevaale spagetti daanav ne rakhe the
 When scientific measurements, such as radiocarbon dating, are taken, the flying Spaghetti transforms the demon figures so that scientists understand that the Earth is billions of years old
 pastafaari dharm kii swarg kii sankalpana main ek bear jwalamukhi or nagn nartakiyaan banane vaala kaarkaana shaamil he
 
 pastafaari nark bhi aisa hi he, par bear basi he or nartkiyon ko yon sanchaarit rog hai
 According to pastoral beliefs, pirates are in reality celestial beings and original pastoralists
 pastafaari maanate hai ki samudri luteron ke "chor or bahishkrut" hone kii dharna madhyayug main isai dharamshastriyon dwaara or aaj antarrashtriya krishnabhaavnamrita sangh dwaara failaai ja rahi juthi soochna kaa nateeja he
 According to them, in reality the pirates were "peace-loving travelers and disseminators of harmony" who distributed sweets to children
 ye kehete hai ki aaj ke samudri luteron kaa "pracheen jindadil samudri lutrron" se koi sambandh nahin he
 Additionally, Pastafari holds the ghosts of pirates responsible for the mysterious disappearance of marine and airplanes from the Bermuda Triangle
 pastafaari har varsh 19 sitambar ko "samudri luteron kii tarah bolo kaa antarrashtriya diwas" manaate hai
 Atheism · Christianity · Hinduism · Islam · Judaism · Sikhism lohas dhaatukarm main pratham sthaan loh utpaadan kaa aata he
 India has been a pioneer in iron production in very ancient times
 dilli kaa lohastambh is baat pratyaksh pramaan he
 India's iron ore mines are among the best and largest in the world
 anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki bharat ke bhugarbha main lagbhag 10 arab ton loh ayask vidyaman he
 Four raw materials are mainly required for iron production: loh ayask, idhan, gaalak flux tathaa ooshmasah padaarth Iron ore ores are classified based on their chemical organization
 hemetite, magnetic, lymonite tathaa siderite lohe ke pramukh ayask hai
 Iron is present in the first three ores as its oxide and in the fourth as carbonate
 vishwa kaa adhikansh lohautpaadan hemetite loh ayask dwaara hi hota he
 Coke is used more as fuel in modern ferro-production method
 ek vishesh prakaar ke koyale ko lagbhag 1,000° sein
 taap par carbonikrut karke coke taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Lumber coal is also used in some special types of kilns
 gaalkon kaa upyog loh ayask tathaa idhan main vidyaman vijaateey padaarthon ko dur karne main kiya jaataa he
 Limestone and dolomite are prominent among cheekers used in iron production
 ooshmasah padaartha loh ayask ko dravit karanevaali bhatthiyon main astr dene ke upyog main aate hai, jisase atyadhik taap ke kaaran bhatthiyon ko koi haani na pahunche
 Most of the fire bricks are used in iron production, but nowadays carbon bricks have also been used somewhere
 louh-ayask main saamanyat: loh kii maatra 30 se 65 prati shat tak hoti he
 Most of the silica and alumina exist in this form of heterogeneous matter
 kabhi kabhi iske saath hi chuunaa bhi paryaapt maatra main mishrit rahata he
 The presence of heterogeneous substances in the ore not only reduces the amount of iron, but also requires more fuel and chewing to expel those substances
 isse loh dravit karanevaali bhatthiyon kii utpaadankshmata main kami to ho hi jaati he, saath hi saath utpaadanvyay main bhi vruddhi ho jaati he
 Sometimes, in heterogeneous materials, the ratio of silica, alumina and lime is such that the ore becomes more self-sufficient and then the need for external chewing is greatly reduced
 loh ayask ko dravit karke loh dhaatu banane kaa kaary jin bhatthiyon main kiya jaataa he unhen vatya bhatthi kehete hai
 Modern aeration is 100 feet or more high and has a circular shape
 vishaal vaatyabhatthee ke jvalan kshetra kaa vyas 30 foot tak hota he
 The ventilation can be divided into four main parts
 bhatthi kaa sheersh bhaag 'prabhaar vinyas' kehalaata he
 By this configuration, iron ore, fuel and sulfur are properly charged in the furnace
 is vinyas main 'dohare shakshanku' kii vyavastha rahati he, jisase dooshit gaisen prabhaar ke samay bhatthi se baahar nahin nikalne paatin
 The total height of the charge configuration is about 20 percent of the entire furnace
 prabhaar vinyas ke neeche ke hisse ko 'stack' kehete hai
 This part gets progressively wider from top to bottom and its total height is about 60 percent of the entire furnace
 iskaa nichalaa bhaag dhalwaan lohe ke bane 12 yaa 16 drudh stambhon par aadhaarit hota he, jisase bhatthi ke nimna bhaag kii aavashyaktaa padane par kholkar marammat kii ja sake
 In modern furnaces the bottom five feet of the stack and the top 10 feet are exactly vertical
 stack ke neeche bhatthi kaa jo bhaag padataa he use jvalanakshetra kehete hai
 The burning area is thinned from top to bottom
 is prakaar yah dekha ja saktaa he ki bhatthi kaa sarvaadhik vyas us sthaan par hota he jahaan stack or jvalanakshetra aapas main milte hai
 The height of the burning area is about 10 per cent of the total height of the furnace
 bhatthi ke sabase nichle khand ko chullital yaa chulhaa kehete hai
 This part is situated below the combustion zone and acts as a basement material of liquefied metal and clinker
 isaki oonchaai bhi bhatthi kii oonchaai kaa lagbhag 10 prati shat hoti he
 The upper part of the stove, where it meets the ignition area, has holes around the furnace, in which air fonts are placed
 in totiyon ke dwaara bhatthi ke andar ucch dabaav par vaayu kaa jhonka bheja jaataa he
 That is why these furnaces are referred to as ventilators
 bhatthi kii bahya akruti ispaat kii moti chaddaron se bani hoti he, jiske andar vibhinn prakaar kii agnisah iton kaa astr diya jaataa he, jisase ucch taap ke kaaran bhatthi ke dhaanche ko koi haani na pahunche
 In the lower part of the furnace where the temperature is excessive, 'cooling' plates are placed in the level of fire bricks to keep the walls cool, in which soft water always flows
 dravit dhaatu tathaa mel ko nikaalane ke liye chuulhe main toti-chhidr tathaa malchhidr bane hote hai
 Most of the iron ore, fuel and cheeks remain in the 'fill' of the ventilation
 in teenon padaarthon kii maatra unke rasinic tathaa bhautik gunon ke aadhaar par nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 The entire furnace is weighted with charge by configuration
 chuulhe ke chaaron lagi hui hawatonti se ucch daab par vaayu kaa jhonka bhatthi ke andar bheja jaataa he
 In modern furnaces, 700 ° -800 ° c before sending air vents inside
 Is heated to jaise hi yah vaayu kaa jhonka prabar ke coke ke sampark main aata he vah jalane lagata he or is tarah bhatthi main ooshmaa utpann hoti he
 This is how the work of the ventilation starts
 jaise jaise thos prabhaar neeche kii ore agrasar hota he vaise vaise kramash: taap main vruddhi hoti he
 The temperature of the top of the furnace is 200 ° –250 ° C
 And slowly it rises near the surface of the spout at 1,850 ° C
 Till
 sheersh bhaag se hawatonti ke dharaatal tak prabhaar ko pahunchne main lagbhag 12-14 ghante lag jate hai, jabaki neeche se uthati hui gas ko sheersh tak pahunchne main ek senkad se bhi kam samay lagata he As the charge moves down, it reaches more and more high temperatures and its humidity disappears
 yah kriya stack ke sheersh se 10 foot neeche tak hoti he, jahaan kaa taap lagbhag 400° sein
 hota he
 When the charge descends further, it is exposed to more high temperatures
 is kshetra main carbon monoksaide dwaara loh oxide ke avkaran kii tivrata bad jaati he
 By reaching 50 feet down, almost the entire iron oxide is degraded and forms a sponge
 tatpashchaat chuunaa pathar kaa vighatan hokar chuunaa tathaa carbon dioxide milte hai
 This lime combines with heterogeneous materials to form a metal
 ab prabhaar neeche utar kar pragalan kshetra main aa jaataa he
 Here the sponge iron comes in contact with coke with a strong flame, so carbon enters it
 lagbhag 1,350° sein
 taap par loh dravit hone lagata he
 At this temperature, the movement of limestone also becomes very intense
 bhatthi ke jvalanakshetra main atyadhik taap hone se kuch mangneej, phosphorus tathaa silicon ke oxide bhi avakrut hokar dhaatu main mil jate hai
 In the same region, iron becomes saturated with carbon and then its temperature rises much higher than the freezing point
 is prakaar dravit ghaatu tathaa mel bhatthi ke tal main ekatrit hote rahete hai or inhen samay samay par tonti tathaa mel chhidron se baahar nikaala jaataa he
 Metallic coal is used as a fuel in modern ventilation furnaces, but in place of metallic coal, lumber coal is also used in some places
 kaath koyale kaa dalan samarthy dhaatukarmee koyale kii tulana main paryaapt kam hota he
 Hence the wood-fired kilns are also small enough
 kaath koyale kii bhatthiyon se kachche lohe ke utpaadan kii vidhiyaan tathaa unka siddhant vaatyabhatthiyon ke samaan hi he
 The difference is that the amount of impurities in them is less and the quality of the iron is good, but the efficiency of these furnaces is much less than in modern viaries
 isliye aajkal inkaa upyog kam ho gaya he
 In modern times, the use of electric furnaces is increasing
 ye bhatthiyaan aise pradeshon main adhik laabhakaari siddh hui hai jahaan dhaatukarmee koyale kii kami athwa abhaav he
 Fuel is used in aeration to heat and disinfect iron ore
 vidyudvidhi main prabhaar ko garam karne kaa kaary vidyut se hota he or keval avkaran ke liye carboneey padaarthon kaa upyog hota he
 The importance of this method increases even more in the sense that it can be used in coal, coke or any of the charcoal
 vatyabhatthiyon kii tulana main isamen keval 40-45 prati shat hi avkaarak lagata he
 The result is that the produced iron has less residual impurities, and less chewing is required to remove these impurities
 nimna coopak bhatthi ko vaatyabhatthee kaa chhot rup kahana chahie
 The composition and procedure of these furnaces is similar to that of furnaces
 in bhatthiyon kaa laabh yah he ki inamen bahut hi nimna prakaar ke aise kachche padaarth upyog main laae ja sakate hai jinka upyog saamaanya vaatyabhatthiyon main nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is not necessary to use metallurgical coal only
