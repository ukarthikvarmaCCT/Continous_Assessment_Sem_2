 Late adolescence and early adulthood are the peak times of onset of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia kaa upachaar kiye jane vaale 40% purushon or 23% mahilaon main, yah sthiti 19 varsh kii umr se pehle utpann hui
 These are very important periods in the social and professional development of a young adult and can be severely hampered

 These are called first-class signs or first-class symptoms of shenider and they include false illusions in the category of being controlled by an external force; The belief that thoughts are being put into one's conscious mind or withdrawn from it; The belief that the views of one person are being transmitted to other people; And listening for confused voices that comment on a person's thoughts or activities or have a conversation with other confused voices
 haalanki unhone vartmaan naidanik mandandon main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he, pratham shrenee ke lakshanon kii vishistataa par prashn uthaaye gaye hai
 a review of clinical studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that these studies allow neither a reaffirmation or rejection of Schneider's claims and suggested that future clinical systems revisions may be the first The emphasis should be on the symptoms of the category
 schizophrenia kaa varnan aksar ek sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak lakshanon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The term positive symptoms signifies symptoms that are not commonly experienced by most individuals but are present in schizophrenia
 unamem mithyaa bhram, shravan sambandhi vibhram or soch sambandhi vikaar shaamil hote hai or unhen vishesh rup se manovikruti kii abhivyakti mana jaataa he
 Negative symptoms are those that are not present in individuals affected by schizophrenia but are typically found in healthy people, that is, symptoms that reflect a loss or loss of general characteristics or abilities

 a third trait group, disruptive syndrome, is commonly discussed and includes chaotic speech, thoughts, and behavior
 anya lakshan vargeekaran kaa pramaan maujuud he
 The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made based on the morphology of the symptoms
 tantrika sambandhi sahasambandhi vasteen paryaapt rup se upyogi maandand uplabdh nahin karaati he
 Diagnosis is based on the individual's own experience report and abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends, or co-workers, and subsequently a clinical assessment conducted by a psychiatrist, social worker, clinical psychologist or other mental health professional
 manorog sambandhi moolyankan main ek manorog sambandhi itihaas or maansik sthiti pariksha ke kuch rup shaamil hote hai
 The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia is the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition DSM-IV-TR and World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-10
 Is obtained
 baad ke maandand vishesh rup se europea deshon main prayukt hote hai jabaki DSM maandand sanyukt rajya america or duniya ke baaki hisson main prayukt kiye jate hai or saath hi ve anusandhan sambandhi adhyayanon main prachlit hai
 The ICD-10 criteria emphasize first-class symptoms of Schneiderian, although, in practice, the synergy between the two regimes is very high
 diagnostic and statistical minial of mental disorders ke chaturth sanskaran ke anusaar, sizophrenia kaa nidaan karne ke liye, teen naidanik maandand puure kiye jane chahie: Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of a mental condition or widespread developmental disorder are present, or if the symptoms are the direct result of a common medical condition or a substance, such as alcoholism or its medication

 schizophrenia ] a more general medical and neurological examination is required to rule out a health-related illness that can rarely cause symptoms similar to psychiatric schizophrenia, such as metabolic disturbances, serological infections, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy
 And brain wounds
 It may be necessary to remove unconsciousness, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, rapid attacks and unstable levels of consciousness, and indicates an underlying health disease
 aam taur par jaanch purvavastha prapti ke liye duhraaye nahin jate hai jab tak ki koi vishisht chikitsa sambandhi sanket nahin ho yaa manovikruti rodhi aushadhi kaa koi pratikul prabhaav nahin ho
 Greek σχίζω = "I refute") Despite the etymology of the word, "schizophrenia" does not mean double personality, DSM-IV-TR main schizophrenia ke paanch up-vargeekaran hai
 The ICD-10 defines two additional modalities
 schizophrenia kii vaidhata ko naidanik ikai ke rup main maanane hetu aalochana kii gai he kyonki isamen vaigyanik vaidhata or naidanik vishwasaneeyata kii kami paayi gai he
 In 2006, a group of mental patients and professionals from the UK debated under the flag of a movement to ban the schizophrenia label because it was rejected because clinical studies of schizophrenia were diversity-based and stain-linked and He called for the adoption of a biological-psychosocial model
 britain ke anya manochikitsakon ke samooh ne yah kah kar is prayaas kaa virodh kiya ki ek ek praavdhanik vichaardhaara hone ke baavjood schizophrenia shabd upyogi he
 The class of different types of schizophrenia used in DSM has also been criticized
 anya maansik vikaron ke samaan, kuch manochikitsakon ne suzav diya he ki anya vibhinnataaon ke saath vyaktigat ayaamon ke aadhaar par iske nidaan ko liya janaa chahie, jisase ki vahaan saamaanya or biimaar longon ke bich ek khai ke bajaae ek satatta bana rahe
 This approach seems very meaningful and serious for research on schizophrenia and its relevance to psychological experiences, which are mostly not stressful, and also build a clear trust among ordinary people
 is avlokan ke saath sahmati pragat karte hue manovaigyanik adgar jones or manochikitsak tony david tathaa nasir ghaemi ne bhranti par saahitiyon kaa paryvekshan karte hue ingit karte hue kaha ki mithyaa bhram kii paribhaasha kii samarupata or sampoornataa ko paane kii ichha bahut logon kii rahi he, mithyaa bhram na hi kabhi aavashyak rup se sthir hote hai, naa hi yah galat hota he or na hi inamen vartmaan kii niyantran ho sakane vaali ghatnaayen hi shaamil hoti hai
 Nancy Anderson, an emerging researcher in the field of schizophrenia, refutes the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria in her criticism of abandoning its validity for clinical improvement alone
 ve is baat par jor detii hai ki isaki naidanik vishwasaneeyata kaa sudhaar karte samay naidanik maapdandon kii manovikruti par adhik bal dene se iskaa moolbhoot gyaan ko ham baadhit kar dete hai jiskaa moolyankan karnaa prastutikarnon main isaki badi vibhinnata ke kaaran sambhav nahin he
 This ideology has also been considered by other psychiatrists

 Neuroscientific Michael Foster Green goes further to suggest that the presence of specific mechanisms of cognition impairment can be used to produce phenotypes that are purely symptom-based alternatives
 sah haniyaan baadhita yaa kami ke aadhaar par manovaigyanik gatividhiyon ke rup main parilakshith hoti hai jaise dimag, aakarshan, kaaryon kii kaarywahi or samasya ko suljhaana
 Removing influential factors from schizophrenia criteria, even though this therapeutic system is widespread, has also led to resistance
 DSM main se ise nikaal dene ke parinamswaroop ek "samaj main nahi aane vaale" alag prakaar kii vikruti – sizophreniavikruti ban kar saamne aayi he
 Referring to very weak reliability, some psychiatrists have completely opposed the idea of schizophrenia as a separate entity
 bhav vikruti or schizophrenia ke bich shrenikrut antar ko craayepelinian dishotomi kehete hai, jisane anuvaanshik epidemyology ke aankadon ko bhi chunauti di he
 Because the reliability of diagnostics creates difficulty in the measurement of its associated effects, examples suggest that genetic and environmental factors may play a role in mixers in schizophrenia outcome
 udaahranon se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki schizophrenia ke naidanik upachaar main mahatvapurn kaarak nihit hote hai lekin ve paryaavarniya karkon or tanaav paidaa karne vaale ghatakon ke mahatv ko prabhavit karte hai
 The implicit idea of overpopulation can be extracted biologically in some people and is known as the stress – diathesis model
 yah vichaar ki jeevigyaanik, manovaigyanik or manochikitsakeey tathaa saamaajik kaarak, sabhi mahatvapurn he, ise "biopsicososhal" model ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Generational assessments of schizophrenia have shown that the problem of isolating the effects of genetics and studies of isolated environments have shown that a high degree of heredity is found in it
 yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki schizophrenia visham antarnihit anuvaanshiki ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen vibhinn bade or chote jokhimon ke jeens ke badhane ke saath hote hai
 Some people have suggested that it is necessary to have several genetic and other risk factors, before one is affected by it, but there is no certainty in it either
 Recent studies of the genome wide association for schizophrenia and commonly practiced disorders are largely isolated, but there are still some shortcomings between these two disorders
 anuvaanshik se jude adhyayan metaenalysis ne bahut hi gambhir or thos udhaaharan gun-sutreey kshetra main shankaaon ke badhane par prastut kiya he, jo pratyaksh rup se vikarayukt schizophrenia 1 jin protein se sampark karata he, jo haal hi main zinc pifungar protein 804e main shaamil he
 Which is characterized by the trait 6 HLA region under which schizophrenia has been associated with rare deletions or microscopic mimicry of DNA sequences, and contains disproportionately neuro-signaling and brain development genes

 The affected person has fewer children than normal people
 is prakaar kii kami 70% purushon or 30% mahilaon main dekhi gai he
 The most prominent central anthropomorphic dilemma is why schizophrenia occurs, if the disease is due to the associated causes of biological heterogeneity, can this variation not be selected and separated? It is necessary to have a complementary and global feature to maintain a balance between such significant inequalities
 atah anumaanit visheshtaon ke sabhi siddhanton ko amaanya kar diya gaya he yaa ve mahatvaheen sabit hue hai
 The occurrence of contingency factors with early neurovicas also increases the risk of developing schizophrenia later
 ek prakaar ke isi jigyaasu nishkarsh se yah pataa chalaa he ki schizophrenia se prabhavit logon main se zyaadaatar log thand yaa basant ke mausam main janmen the

 Living in urban environments continuously for a long time has also been considered as a risk factor for schizophrenia
 saamaajik asuvidha ko bhi iskaa ek kaarak mana gaya he, jisamen garibi or saamaajik vishmata ke kaaran palaayan, rang yaa nasl bhed, parivaar kaa bikharana, berogari or kamjor rahan-sahan vyavastha aata he
 Childhood experiences of abuse or trauma have also been implicated later in life as a risk factor for the diagnosis of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia ke liye mata-pita kii dekhbhaal ko jimmedaar nahin mana gaya he lekin asahyogaatmak sambandhon kaa tut janaa bhi iske jokhimon ke badhane main sahaayak hota he
 However, in about half of schizophrenia patients, it was found that they used drugs or alcohol, which are difficult to prove the association between drug use and the apparent contingency of schizophrenia
 iske liye aksar istemaal kiye jane vaale do vyakhyaaon main hai "iskaa lagaataar istemaal sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he" or "iskaa lagaataar upyog hi chizophrenia kaa kaaran he" or yah donon baaten sahi hai
 The 2007 metaanalysis estimates that frequent use increases mental impairment based on the amount of the drug, including schizophrenia
 iske bahut hi kam udhaaharan hai jo yah bataate hai ki sharaab kaa seven sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he, yaa yah ki maansik rup se vyakti kisi vishesh dawa kaa chayan apane swayan ke upachaar ke liye kar letaa he, is sambhaavna kaa sahyog karne vaale kuch hi udhaaharan hai ki dawa kaa prayog pratikul maansik str kaa kaaran jaise maansik tanaav, jigyaasa, pareshaani, ubaaupan or akelepan kaa kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Because psychosis itself is highly understood and metaemphatime can result in the presence of cocaine use or cocaine-based psychosis with similar symptoms, even when the user is avoiding it
 manochikitsa virdohi andolan ke taur par jane jane vaale prayaas jo 1960 ke dashak main atyadhik sakriy the, rudhiwaadi medical vichaardhaara kaa virodh karte hai ki sizophrenia ek beemaari he
 Psychiatrist Thomas Sasas insists that the psychopath does not get sick, but that person gets lost in the unconventional thoughts and habits that our society considers inconvenient
 ve kehete hai ki samaaj in parais prakaar biimaar or unki aadaton ko vargeekrut karke unke saath anyaay karata he or unke prati kathorta kaa vyavhaar apane saamaajik niyantran ke adheen karata he
 According to this ideology, 'schizophrenia' does not occur but it is a type of social construction, created by those who distinguish between the normal and the unusual in society
 ssaaj ne manochikitsakeey upachaar ke maamle main apane aap ko kabhi bhi "manochikitsa virdohi" nahin samajha he, lekin ve aisa maanate hai ki vayaskon ke bich paraspar paraamarsh se upachaar prarambh kiya janaa chahie basharte iske ki ise vyakti kii ichha ke viruddh us par thopa jaae
 a set of informal psychiatric systems has been designed for the development and care of schizophrenia
 sangyaan main laae gaye paddhtiyon ko naidanik upachaaron ke jokhimon ke saath chinhit kiya gaya he, visheshkar jab vyakti tanaav yaa vismay kii sthiti main hota he, isaki haniyon par atyadhik dhyaan dena, nishkarshon par ekadam pahunch janaa, aakasmik aropan karnaa, saamaajik or maansik staron ke bare main baadhit yuktikaran karnaa, apane andar kii bhaavana ko kisi bahari strot dwaara vyakt nahin kar paanaa or praarambhik taur par drishy kii samasya kaa hona or isaki ekaagratha se dekhbhaal shaamil he
 Some of the well-known features are global neurocognitive impairment in the brain, attention, attention, problem diagnosis, action or social cognition, while others are associated with a particular case and experience
 "adhardaar prabhaav" ke saman taur par hone ke baavjood haal ke nishkarshon se pataa chalaa he ki kai vyaktiyon main sizophrenia ke dauraan ucch bhavuk pratiuttaron, visheshkar tanavagrast yaa nakaaratmak indrio or aisi vikruti ke samvedansheeltaa lakshanon ke samroop vyapti kaa kaaran bhi banati he
 Some examples suggest that the theme of ambiguous belief and the experience of psychosis may be characterized by a disorder characterized by emotion, and affect the symptoms of how a person interprets their experiences
 isaki haniyon ko dur rakhane ke liye "surakshit aadaton" kaa upyog isaki abhaason ke kram main sahaayak hota he
 Examples of the role of the psychological system come forward on the effect of therapies on the symptoms of schizophrenia
 mastishk kii karypranali main kriyaatmak bhinnataaon ke pareekshan ke liye tantrikeey manovaigyanik jaancho or mastishk pratirupan takneekon jaise fmri or PET dwaara kiye gaye adhyayanon se yah pataa chalaa he ki bhinnataayen adhiktar lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag, hippocampus or canapati ke hisson main paayi jaati hai
 These differences have been linked to neurocognitive cognitive impairments that are often considered insane / psychiatric
 mastishk ke mijolimbik maarg main dopamine kii karypranali par vishesh rup se dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he
 a major reason for doing this is the finding of results from incidental studies that a group of drugs, which block the functioning of dopamine and known as phenothiazines, may reduce psychiatric symptoms
 is avadharana kii pushti is tathy bhi hoti he ki amphetamins, jo dopamine ke straav ko yaati he, sizophrenia kii sthiti main yah manorog ke lakshanon ko bigaad sakati he
 a dominant concept, also known as the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, states that over-activation of D2 receptors causes schizophrenia
 yadhyapi, sabhi manorog pratirodhi prabhaavon main aam, D2 avrodh ke aadhaar par 20 varshon tak yahi mana gaya jab tak ki 1990 ke daa ke madhya main PET or SPET pratirupan ke adhyayanon ne samarthak pramaan nahin die
 This interpretation is now considered to be extremely common, as one of the newer psychiatric resistant treatments is as effective as the old one, but it also affects the functioning of cirrotonin and may possibly have a slightly lower dopamine inhibitory effect
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main neurotransmeter glutamet or NMDA glutamet abhigraahak ke ghataae gaye prabhaav par bhi dhyaan diya gaya he
 This concept is also supported by the unusually low levels of glutamate receptors found in posthumous brain testing of people who were previously treated for schizophrenia 199, as well as the discovery that glutamate inhibitory drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine Can simulate symptoms and cognitive problems associated with these situations
 yah tathy ki glutamet abhigraahak ke kam prabhavali hone kaa matlab he lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag or hippocample kii karypranali kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye janevaale jaanchon kaa sateek naa hona or yah ki glutamet dopamine kii karypranali ko prabhavit karata he, in sabhi ko sizophrenia main bhamil kiya gaya he, jinke chizophrenia main glutamet margon kii bhoomika main ek mahatvapurn madhyasth hone kaa pataa chalata he
 However, in the case of positive symptoms, glutamatergic treatment fails
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main mastishk ke kuch vishesh kshetron kii sanrachana or aakaar main bhinnataaon ke aadhaar par parinaamon main bhinnta dekhi jaati he
 Analysis of MRI studies in 2006 showed that for the first time patients with psychiatric symptoms had decreased overall brain and hippocampal volume, and that ventricular volume had increased, compared to patients with healthy controls
 haalanki, in adhyayanon ke anusaar wolum main ausat badlaav MRI ke tareekon dwaara tay kii gayi maapan seemaa ke najadik he, isliye yah tay karnaa bhosh rah jaataa he ki sizophrenia ek tantrikana prakriya he jo us samay bhaaru hoti he jab iske lakshan dikhaai padate hai, yaa yah ki ise ek aisi tantrikeey vikaas kii prakriya samajhnaa behatar he, jisamen kam umr main hi mastishk kii asaamaanya maatra taiyaar ho jaati he
 The psychoses of the first episode were associated with a significant reduction in psychiatric antidote drugs such as haloperidal, whereas the excessive decrease in gray matter volume was not associated with unusual psychiatric antidepressants such as olanzepine
 gairmanviya primets ke adhyayanon se pataa chalaa ki aadaar manorog pratirodhi dawaaon or asaamaanya manorog pratirodhi dawaaon, donon main grey or white matter main kami paayi gayi
 Analysis of diffusion tensor modeling studies in 2009 revealed two consecutive regions of fractional anisotropy reduction in schizophrenia
 One area was in the left frontal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus to the White Matter tract and the other area was in the temporal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, insula, hippocampus amygdala, temporal, and occipital lobe
 Went across the White Matter tract
 lekhak kaa kahana he ki sizophrenia main white matter tract ke do network prabhavit ho sakate hai, jisase un grey matter kshetron ke 'sampark tut jane' kii sambhaavna rahati he jinase ye jude hote hai
 During fmri studies, a deep correlation between brain default networks and taskpositive networks was observed in schizophrenia patients and may demonstrate a high degree of adaptation to attention to chronological observation and external observation
 adhik virdohi do network ke bich sahasambandh network ke bich atyadhik pratidwandvita pataa chalata he
 There are no reliable measurements for the advanced stages of schizophrenia, although the concomitance of both genetic factors as well as nonadolescent psychoses may provide a better estimate of how later treatment may continue
 aise vyakti jo 'atyadhik jokhimpurna maansik avasthaa' kii shrenee main aate hai, jinamein sizophrenia kii paariwarik prishrubhumi ke sathsath asthaayee yaa swaniyantrit manovikrutiyon ke lakshan bhamil hai, unamem ek vashar ke baad kii paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par ilaaj kii sambhaavna 2040 pratit tak hoti he
 The use of psychiatric treatments and drugs has been found to be far more effective in reducing the likelihood of individuals in the category of 'highly risky' than in patients with fully developed schizophrenia
 haalanki, manorog pratirodhi ilaajon ke dushprabhavon ke sandarbh main, un logon kaa ilaaj kahin adhik vivaadit he, jo kabhi sizophrenia kaa car nahin hue, vishkar disphigaring taradive diskinesia ke lakshanon vaale or durlabh parantu kahin adhik maarak neuroleptic mailinent syndrome vaale rogiyon main

 New medical thinking suggests that even early intervention in psychiatric conditions is a retrograde preventive measure to prevent later episodes and the long-term disability associated with schizophrenia
 is rog se mukti kii avadharana abhi tak vivaadit he, kyonki isaki paribhaasha par koi ekamat nahin he, haalanki lakshno ko dur karne ke liye kuch upaay haal hi main sujhaaye gaye hai
 Effective treatment of schizophrenia is often considered to be dependent on standard methods, one of the most common methods being the measurement of positive and negative symptoms
 lakshno kaa prabandhan or kaaryakshmata ko uyana, rogamukti kii tulana main kahin adhik prabhavi mana jaataa he
 Its treatment was discovered in the mid-1950s with the development and presentation of chlorpromazine
 iske liye dhire-dhire ek recovery model ko apanaaya gaya, jisamen ummiido ko tane, saktikaran or saamaajik manyata par jor diya gaya
 Severe schizophrenia conditions may require hospitalization
 yah svaichhik yaa anaichhik bhi ho saktaa he
 Due to changes in the recruitment process, it is no longer common for this to remain in the hospital for a long time, although it may need to be done

 There is a belief among many non-western communities that schizophrenia can only be treated in more informal, community-controlled ways

 Many practitioners and researchers suspect that differences in respective levels of social engagement and acceptance are one of the reasons, however, that cultural studies are still needed to explain these results
 sizophrenia ke liye pehle str kaa manochikitsakeey ilaaj he manorog pratirodhi upachaar

 New and unusual anti-psychotic drugs are commonly used for chronic abnormal psychosis, but they are expensive and are prone to weight gain and obesity-related diseases
 san 2008 main, yues nashnal institute of mental health dwaara kiye gaye aakasmik pareekshan ke parinaamon main ye paaya gaya, ki ek pratham peedhee ke pratinidhi swaroop paaya jane vaala manovikruti rodhi, paraphanjin, anek naveen dawaaon ke 18 maah kii maatra kii apeksha adhik prabhaavshaalee va kifayati he
 The most unusual psychotic patient wanted to continue, ie olanzhapine, had risks of weight gain and metabolic disturbances
 chlojhapin un marijon ke liye sabase zyada asarkaari tha jo anya dawaaon par koi pratikriya nahin dete the
 Since its trial did not take patients with Tardive dyskinesia, its effects on these types of people could not be ascertained
 chunki isamen kaaphi kam pashchaat prabhaav saamne aae the jo ki gatishiltaa ko prabhavit kar sakate the, asaamaanya antipsycotics kai varshon se hi sizophrenia ke liye pratham pankti kaa ilaaj rahaa he, jab tak ki kuch dawaaon ko jo ki isi shrenee main the, unhe food and drug administration dwaara chizophrenia se peedit bacchon or kishoron ke liye hanirahit nahin maan liya gaya
 This benefit was definitely given, but with obesity and metabolic rate disturbance due to which its use remained questionable for a long time
 khaskar bacchon or kishoron main sizophrenia hone par unhe davaaiyon ke saath hi paariwarik vyavhaar chikitsa bhi di jaani chaiye
 Current criticisms have rebutted the claim that abnormal antipsychotics have some additional pyramidal postoperative effects, especially if it is taken in small quantities or chosen as an anti-psychosis of low potency
 sizophrenia se peedit mahilaon main asaamaanya manovikruti rodhi istemaal karne par prolactin ilveshan kaa asar dekha gaya he
 It is not yet known whether new antipsychotics reduce the risk of neuroleptic malignant syndromes, a rare but serious and dangerous neurological problem with the side effects of neuroleptic or psychotropic drugs

 For other patients who cannot or do not take regular medicines, long-term depot preparations of antipsychotics will be given every two weeks so that control can be done

 puraanon main akashganga or prithvi par sthit ganga nadi ko ek dusre kaa joda mana jaataa tha or donon ko pavitra mana jaataa tha
 The galaxy has been called "kshir" in ancient Hindu religious texts
 bhartiya upmahadweep ke baahar bhi kai sabhyataaon ko akashganga dudhia lagi
 The word "galaxy" originates from the Greek word "gala", which also means milk
 farsi sanskrit kii hi tarah ek hind-irani bhashaa he, isliye uskaa "doodh" ke liye shabd sanskrit ke "ksheer" se miltaa-julata sajaateey shabd "sheer" he or akashganga ko "raah-e-shiri" bulaayaa jaataa he

 upar se yah bhi dekha gaya he ke anya sarpil gallexiyon main bhujaayen kabhi-kabhi ajeeb dishaao main mudi hui hoti hai yaa phir vibhajit hokar upabhujaayen banati hai
 Scientists differ in the size of the arms due to these intricacies
 2008 tak mana jaataa tha ke akashganga kii chaar mukhya bhujaayen hai or kam-se-kam do choti bhujaayen hai, jinamein se ek shikari-hans bhujaa he jisapar hamaara saura mandal sthit he

 If this is true, then the size of the galaxy will be different from Andromeda and will be like a spiral galaxy named NGG 1365

 The tournament began in 1905 at the Weerhausman Cricket Ground
 It was named the Australasian Championships because by 1912 it was organized by both Australia and New Zealand
 The competition was only expanded to include women's tennis in 1922
 Due to the geographical distance separating it from the other tournaments, the top American and European players rarely deigned to travel down to the Antipodes until the end of the 1970s, meaning that the title was almost exclusively won by Australians up until that date
 In 1972, The Australian Tennis Federation decided to change the venue of the event every year, with Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and even New Zealand taking turns to host the tournament
 In 1983, the Australian Open set up home in Kooyong, Melbourne, where it began to earn the respect of the tennis-playing world until its move in 1988 to Flinders Park
 Grass courts made way for hard Rebound Ace surfaces, and in 1997, Flinders Park was renamed Melbourne Park
 Since 1988, the Australian Open is the only Grand Slam tournament to have two courts covered by retractable roofs

 udhaaharan ke liye, "e pride of loyns", vaakyansh main pride samoohvachak sangya he
 Most collective nouns are used in everyday conversation, as the word "group" is a very common word and does not convey any kind of root object
 For example, "group of People", "group of Dogs" and "group of Ideas" are correct
 anya, vishesh rup se aise shabd jo samoohvachak sangya ke bahut bade upvarg se sambandhit he terms of venry ke rup main jane jate hai, ek hi prakaar kii jati kii vastuon ko darshaate hai
 For example, in the context of animals the word "pride" refers to lions, not dogs or lamas
 samoohvachak sangya ko samuhik sangya yaa samuhik vyakaran sambandhi sankhya ke saath mila kar nahin dekha janaa chahie
 Etymology is used for many collective words
 kyonki vyutpatti khule taur par vaakya rachana sambandhi roopaatmak paddati kii tulana main shabd gathan kii prakriya dhimi or kam upyogi he, is tarah se bahut kam samoohvachak ban pate hai
 Etymologically grouped words are often different from original words, as with all etymological words, they make new connotations and new words
 angreji main -age or -ede se ant honevaale shabd aksar samoohvachak shabd ko darshaate hai
 Sometimes these relationships are easily recognizable: baggage, drainage, blockade
 However, if seen through etymology, the derived words carry a very special meaning
 samoohvachak kaa nirmaan karne ke liye german jeei- upsarg kaa istemaal karte hai
 The root words are often applied umlaut and suffixes, as well as the ge-prefix
 Almost all nouns of this kind are impotent
 inke udhaaharan is prakaar hai: Two good examples of collective nouns are "team" and "government", both of which refer to groups of people
 donon "team" or "government" sankhyavachak sangyaaen hai
 , "two Teams", "most Teams", "one Governments", "two Governments", "many Governments"
 However, the fact is often confused with the fact that plural verb forms can always be used in English with the singular form of these nouns, as in many countries)
 Conversely, "-s" can always be used at the end of nouns in singular verb forms that were once considered plural
 It is clear that "mismatch number" is actually a natural and logical feature of human language and its process is a subtle characterization of the underlying idea in words
 british angreji main yah sweekaar kar liya gaya he ki samoohvachak sangya sandarbh or iske taatpary ke lakshanalankarik parivartan ke aadhaar par kriya rup main ekvachan yaa bahuvachan kii tarah liye ja sakate hai
 For example, "the Team is in the Dressing Room") represents the team as a group, while "the Team Are Fighting Among Demeselves")) represents the team as individuals
 british angreji main aisa khel-kud ke sandarbh main deshon or shaharon ke naam ke saath bhi hota he; udhaaharan ke liye, "germany haev van da compitishan", "madrid haev lost thri consextive maches" ityadi
 america angreji main, samoohvachak sangyaaen aamtaur par ekvachan kriya rup kaa prayog karti hai, lekin jahaan sangya ko ek tarah ke vyaktiyon ke samooh ke rup main samajha jaataa he vahaan ekvachan yaa bahuvachan kriya america prayog main sahi he
 In cases where a symptomatic change comes in another way, it may be necessary to remake the whole sentence to avoid the symptom
 "the Team Members Are Fighting Among Demeselves" or simply "the Team Is Fighting"
 ) american and british english difernsej - formal and noshanal agreement dekhen
 a good example of such symptomatic change is in the following sentence containing the change from singular to plural) "the Team Have Finished the Project"
 The underlying idea in this sentence is that each member of the group is working together to complete a project
 unki uplabdhi samuhik he or alag pahchaan par jor nahin daalaa gaya he, phir bhi ek hi saath unhen alag bhi kar diya gaya he; "team haev" shabd kaa chayan unki samuhikta or unki alag pahchaan ko ek hi saath bataane main kaamyaab ho jaataa he
 a good example of such symptomatic change is from plural to singular in the following sentence: "mathematics is my favorite academic subject"
 The term "mathematics" may be plural in the original concept of a mathematical enterprise, but the metamorphic change — that is, the concept changes from "enterprise" to "the whole nature of the enterprise" —is that of mathematics as a singular entity
 The experiment takes the form of a singular verb
 isi niyam ke tahat jo anya samoohvachak sangyaaon par lagu hote hai, nammaatr ke liye ekvachan sarvanaamon ke bahuvachan kriya ko samoohvachak sangya kii tarah liya ja saktaa he
 For example, it is correct to use "nun are so worthy as those who are sure you're right" in British English and American English
 is maamle main, bahuvachan kriya kaa istemaal hua he, kyonki "nan" kehane se ek se adhik vastu yaa vyakti kaa pataa chalata he
 The combination of two different concepts of collective noun and mass noun often leads to confusion
 aam taur par, samoohvachak sangya dravyavachak sangya nahin he, balki sankhyavachak sangya kaa ek vishesh upvarg he
 However, the term "collective noun" is often used for "mass noun", as users are confused by the similarity of two different types of verbs: as "water" or "furniture" is seen in mass nouns
 Is, in which only the singular verb form is used, because the component is grammatically non-discrete; The difference of the different components is also seen in the collective noun, the group and the result of its symptomatic change, which has been discussed earlier
 sankhyavachak sangya se nikal kar viksit hote hue bhi "mathematics" or "physics" sahit kuch shabd dravyavachak sangya kii samaj paidaa karte hai
 Template: Animalnouns The tradition of using collective nouns for a particular type of animal dates back to at least the fifteenth century from the English medieval hunting tradition
 kisaanon yaa anyon se apane aapako alag karne ke liye sajjanon dwaara terms of venry kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha or yah unki shiksha kaa ang ban gaya
 There were only a few words for groups of animals; Others, such as "singular" for the Boers, described their characteristics or propensity for life
 "singular" bhi french ) kaa ek apbhransh ho saktaa he
 All the words have been accepted as collective nouns due to centuries of misunderstandings, and some remain unrecognizable through language changes and due to transliteration errors: for "basenes") "busy-ness" Changed to "faces"
 kabhi kabhi pashuon ke samooh ke liye shabd keval ek nishchit sandarbh main ek samooh par lagu honge
 sahi myne main "hard" kaa ullekh junglee ghodon ke ek samooh ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, na ki paaltu ghodon ke samooh ke liye
 "padling of ducks" sirf pani ke battakh ke liye kaha jaataa he
 The herd of ducks on the ground is called the "gaggle of Geese", while the flying duckling will be called the "sky of Geese"
 ghatak vastu vishesh samuhik sangyaaon ke prati rujhaan sadaiv ucch bana rahaa he or pratyaashee samoohvachak sangyaaon ko gadhana kai lekhakon ke liye man bailaav kaa vishay rahaa he, jiname kuch pashuon se itar sangyaaen, jaise ki vyavsaay shaamil hai, udhaaharan " "sequiter of logiciens" "

 Paranormal psychology is the branch of psychology that scientifically studies the extraordinary behaviors, thoughts, knowledge, feelings and actions of humans
 asaamaanya yaa asaadhaaran vyavhaar vah he jo saamaanya yaa saadhaaran vyavhaar se bhinn ho
 Ordinary behavior is that which is seen most often and which is not surprising and no concern for it
 vaise to sabhi manushyon ke vyavhaar main kuch na kuch visheshta or bhinnata hoti he jo ek vyakti ko duusare se bhinn batalaati he, phir bhi jabatak vah visheshta ati adbhut na ho, koi usase udign nahin hota, uski ore kisi kaa vishesh dhyaan nahin jaataa
 But when a person's behavior, knowledge, feeling, or action is different from other people in a particular quantity and special way and so different that other people may find it strange, then that action or behavior is called abnormal or extraordinary
 iskaa vishay-vastu multah anabhiyojit vyavhaaron, vyaktitv ashaanti evam vighatit vyaktitv kaa adhyayan karne tathaa unke upachaar ke tareekon par vichaar karne se sambandhit he
 Some of the important topics under Unusual Psychology are- asaamaanya manovigyaan ke kai prakaar hote hai : Impulsive, in which the lack of any such behavior, knowledge, feeling and action is found in ordinary or ordinary human beings
 jaise kisi vyakti main kisi prakaar ke indriyagyaan kaa abhaav, athwa kampravriti athwa kriyashakti kaa abhaav
 Increase in excess or quantity of a particular power, knowledge, emotion or action
 kisi vishesh shakti, gyaan, bhav yaa kriya kii adhikta yaa maatra main vruddhi
 Behavior so different from unusual behavior that it seems to be unique and surprising
 udaahranarth kah sakate hai ki saadhaaran kampravriti ke asaamaanya rup kaa bhav, kamahraas, kamadhiky or vikrut kaam ho sakate hai
 If there is any kind of abnormality, then not only the person in whom that abnormality is found, but also for the society, it becomes a problem by becoming annoying
 atev samaaj ke liye asaamanyata ek badi samasya he
 It is said that 10 percent of the people in the United States of America are abnormal, that is why the society there was prosperous and prosperous in every way, it cannot be said happy
 kuch asaamanyataayen to aisi hoti hai ki unke kaaran kisi kii vishesh haani nahin hoti, ve keval aashcharya or kautuhal kaa vishay hoti hai, kintu kuch asaamanyataayen aisi hoti hai jinke kaaran vyakti kaa apana jivan du:khee, asafal or asamarth ho jaataa he, par unase dusron ko vishesh ksht or haani nahin hoti
 They are called simple mental diseases
 jab maansik rog is prakaar kaa ho jaae ki usase duusare vyaktiyon ko bhay, du:kha, ksht or haani hone lage te use paagalpan kehete hai
 When the amount of insanity exceeds, that person is kept in a mental institution, so that it does not become annoying and harmful to others by remaining independent
 us samay or un deshon main jab or jahaan manovigyaan kaa adhik gyaan nahin tha, manorogi or paaglon ke sambandh main yah mithyaa dharna thi ki unpar bhoot, pishaach yaa haivaan kaa prabhaav pad gaya he or ve unamem se kisi ke vash main hokar asaamaanya vyavhaar karte hai
 To cure them, prayers, mantras, tantras, etc
 were used, or they were beaten up and beaten by ghosts or demons from their bodies
 aadhunik samay main manovigyaan ne itani unnati kar lee he ki ab manorog, paagalpan or manushya ke asaamaanya vyavhaar ke kaaran, swaroop or upachaar ko bahut log jaan gaye hai
 In unusual psychology, there is a special discussion of these topics: asaamanyata kaa swaroop or uski pahchaan
 a study of the nature, characteristics and causes of emotional distortions in many types of ordinary human knowledge, actions, emotions and personality and social behavior
 aise manorog jinamein anek prakaar kii manovikrutiyaan unke lakshanon ke rup main pai jaati he
 Due to these, there is some peculiarity in the conduct and behavior of a person, but he is not completely ineffective and inept
 inako saadhaaran manorog kah sakate hai
 In such a disease, a thought sits firmly in the mind and does not go away
 yada-kada or anivaary rup se vah rogi ke man main aata rahata he
 In one, some unusual and unprovoked special fear is experienced occasionally and inevitably
 jin vastuon se saadhaaran manushya nahin darate, maansik rogi unase bhaybheet hota he
 Some people are so much inspired and compelled to do any kind of action, which they do not need in any way, that they do not feel rested without doing it
 asaamaanya vyaktitv jisaki abhivyakti naanaa ke unmaadon main hoti he
 In this disease, the person lacks consistency in nature, thoughts, feelings and actions, harmony and adaptability to situations, lack of formation of personality and loss of control over one's own actions and reactions
 dvivyaktitv athwa vyaktitv kii tabdili, nixravastha main uthakar chalanaa phirana, apane naam, vansh or nagar kaa vismaran hokar duusare naam aadi kaa grahan kar lenaa ityadi baaten ho jaati hai
 The patient of this disease, for no reason, weeps, laughs, speaks; Sometimes, silence prevails
 sharir main naanaa prakaar kii pidaaon or indriyon main naanaa prakaar ke gyaan kaa abhaav anubhav karata he
 Neither he himself is happy nor does he allow the people of Qutub to be happy
 bhayankar maansik rog, jinke ho jane se manushya kaa vyaktigat jivan nikamma, asafal or du:khee ho jaataa he or samaaj ke prati vah vyarth bharrup or bhayanak ho jaataa he; usko or logon se alag rakhane kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 There are three diseases in this category: ati ucch pratibhashali or janmajaat nune pratibhavale vyaktiyon kaa adhyayan bhi asaamaanya manovigyaan karata he
 Although it is a very old belief that the amount of talent of each person is different, the method of determining the variation of the amount of talent of man has been invented in Western countries since few days
 yadi saamaanya manushya kii pratibha kii maatra kii kalpana 100 kii jaae to sansar main 20 se lekar 200 maatra kii pratibhavale vyakti paae jate hai
 Of these, those from 90 to 110 will be called ordinary people, those less than 90 are low and those up to 110 will be called high-ranking talent
 atinimn, nimna or ishat nimna tathaa ati ucch, ucch or ishat ucch matraavaale bhi bahut vyakti milenge
 The study of the knowledge, expressions and actions of these special types of talent also makes unusual psychology
 asaamaanya manovigyaan jaagrath avasthaa se swapn, sushupti or samadhi, murchha, sammohit nidra, nidraheenata or nidrabhraman aadi avasthaaon ko bhi samajhane kaa praytn karata he or yah jaananaa chaata he ki jaagrath avasthaa se iskaa kya sambandh he
 Even in the ordinary waking behavior of human beings, there are some such strange and accidental incidents which do not have knowledge of the reasons and on which their doers themselves are surprised
 jaise, kisi ke munh se kuch adwitiya, avaanchit or anupyukt shabdon kaa nikal padana, kuch anuchit baaten kalam se likh janaa; jinke karne kaa iraadaa na hote hue or jinako karke pachhtaawaa hota he, aise kaamon ko kar daalana
 This type of phenomenon also studies abnormal psychology
 aparaadhiyon or visheshat: un aparaadhiyon kii manovritiyon kaa bhi asaamaanya manovigyaan adhyayan karata he jo man kii durbalataaon or maansik rugnataa ke kaaran evam apane agyaat man kii preranaon or ichchhaaon ke kaaran aparaadh karte hai
 It is unusual psychology to study the above mentioned subjects in a scientific way, there is no difference of opinion; But there is a big difference of opinion in this science on what are the causes of these unusual and extraordinary events
 yah to sabhi vaigyanik maanate hai ki manovikrutiyon kii utpatti ke kaarnon main bhoot, pishaach, shaitan aadi ke prabhaav kaa maananaa anaavashyak or avaigyanik he
 Their reasons have to be found only in body, mind and social conditions
 is sambandh main anek mat prachlit hote hue bhi teen maton ko pradhanta di ja sakati he or unamem samanvay bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 They are: shaareerik tatwon kaa rasinic hraas athwa ativruddhi
 Penetration or ingestion of toxic chemical elements and deformity or destruction of body parts and organs, especially brain and nerves
 saamaajik paristhitiyon kii atyant pratikulata or unase vyakti ke upar anupyukt dabaav tathaa unke dwaara vyakti kii paraajay
 External trauma and resourcelessness
 agyaat or gupt maansik vasanaye, pravritiyaan or bhavanaayen jinka gyaan man ke upar agyaat rup se prabhaav daalata he
 Freud, Adler, and Yung have done a lot of work in this direction and based on their valuable discoveries, many mental illnesses are also treated
 maansik asaamanyataon or rogon kaa upachaar bhi asaamaanya manovigyaan ke antargat hota he
 Based on the study of the causes of diseases, many types of treatments are produced
 unamem pradhan ye hai : Chemical worker supply
 sanmohan dwaara nirdesh dekar vyakti kii supt shaktiyon kaa udbodhan
 Psychoanalysis, by which the knowledge contained in the unknown mind is overcome by acquiring knowledge
 mastishk kii shalyachikitsa
 Re-learning by changing the inappropriate nature of childhood and creating other behaviors and reactions etc
 anek prakaar kii vidhiyon kaa prayog maansik chikitsa main kiya jaataa he
 The study of abnormal behavior is not a new step but has a long interesting history
 asaamaanya vyavhaar yaa maansik bimariyon ke adhyayan kii shuruyaat maanav jati ke abhilikhit itihaas se hi hoti he haalaanki maanav jati kii sristi kaa itihaas to usase kaaphi pehle shuru hota he
 Psychologists have no historical mention of unusual behavior in ancient times
 us samay kaa adhyayan maatr adhuraa tha jo avaigyanik siddhanton par aadhaarit tha
 According to Kishkar, the history of unusual psychology from that time till today has been divided into the following three main parts- 1791 : galvaani is nishkarsh par pahunche ki tantrika aaveg kaa swaroop vaidyutiya hota he
