 It is especially used in writing Arabic letters, which is considered part of Islamic culture
 or yah aksharankan farsi aksharankan se liya gaya he
 In Arabic, 'khat' means 'streak' or 'tamir'
 yah islaami aksharankan kii tarqi quran ko likhane main siddhhast logon dwaara hui, jo islaami samskruti kaa hissaa ban gai
 These letters can be seen as artifacts on many buildings such as Qila, Masjid, Madrasa, Dargah, Kabrastan Wagaira

 It still has training centers in India
 sampradike tareeqe main iskaa kalakaar 'kalam' yaa pen kaa upyog karata he jo bambu se bana hota he

 Islamic alphabet is not only on paper, but also on paving, utensils, carpet, and stones
 kagaz ke banane se pehle khaalon par, kenvas par, kapadon par ye kala pradarshit hoti thi
 After making paper, there was revolution in this art
 jab europe carch ke monasteries main darjanon kitaaben thim to muslim duniya main saikadon balki hajaaron kitaaben pai gai
 : 218 sikke bhi is kala ke liye upyogit the
 In the era of the Islamic Khilafat in 692 AD, coins began to be used in place of pictures, which were commonly written on the denominations of the Quran
 dasvin shatabdi main, persian, jo islam dharm main shaamil huve, is aksharankan kala ko reshmi kapadon par, kalinon par pradarshit karne lage
 At that time such clothes were considered valuable
 crussederon ne in kapadon ko yurap le gayi, is tar yurap main aksharankan kala kaa parichay hua
 : 223–5 kufik style, arabi kii pracheen lipi style he
 The way of corner making in this letter writing reminds us of ancient Nabatian letters
 is kufik style main 17 akshar aise hai jin ko arab nahin hote
 Then, it is made useless and short, with the help of which the reader can read it with correct pronunciation
 arabi akshar baad main 29 ho gayi
 This style originated in the Iraqi city of Kufa, and flourished in the 7th century
 isi nagar ke naam se is style ko kufi yaa kufik style naam sthir hua
 This style went on to be written in many forms, such as floral, etching, peaked, boarder forms, and chaturcryas form
 yah sheliyaan 8 se 10 veen shatabdi ke dauraan "quran" kii kapiyaan likhane main upyog kii jaati thim
 Later in the 11th century it was also used as an ordinary script
 saath saath alankaran karne ke liye bhi yah style kaa upyog hone laga
 There are no specific formulas for the use of the coffee style; The only formula or method is to write its letters angularly
 is ko likhane kaa koi khaas tareeqa yaa sutara nahin hone ke kaaran yah style anya deshon main anya tareekhon se upyog hone lagi
 Writers also started writing it in their own way, in which clever designs began to be used beautifully in the shape of flowers
 is style ke saadhaaran rup:or "ali" style jo chatursreey rup main likhi jaye use "bannai" kehete hai
 Contemporary lettering artists are used today for new decorations and thus are popular
 shilalekhon ke alankaran ke liye yurap main upyogit style isi kufi kii nakal he jo madhya yug or saanskruthik punarujeevankaal main upyog kiya jaataa tha
 Did not know what the reasons are for the use of this style
 aisa bhi lagata he ki pashchimi log 13 or 14 veen shatabdi main upyogit yah style kristu ke jivan kaal kii thi, bhram tha
 Cursive script was also in use with this coffee style
 kintu praarambhik avasthaa main is style main koi sthir sutara nahin the is liye anaupchaarik uddeshy ke taur par upyogit thi
 After the emergence of Islam, the need for a new script was also realized for practice, for conversion, and the new popular style, the Narsha style, transformed in the 10th century
 is lipi ko lekh likhane, sarkari lekhanon main, vyaktigat patr-vyavhaar main or quran likhane main upyog hone laga
 This script became the foundation of the new Arabic script
 is lipi kaa maanakeekaran kaa kirit "ebn muqla" ko jaataa he, baad main abu hayaan at-tauhidi or mohammad ebn abd arrahmaman ko jaataa he
 Ibn Mukla is considered to be the inventor of the nascent lettering alphabet
 is ne naskh lipi likhane ke kai sutara bhu bataaye, jis main thodi galtiyaan bhi dekhi gayin
 Some forms of racial lipography: islam dharm jaise badhane or failane laga arabi lipi bhi duniya ke kai praanton main sthapit huvi
 And in the 14th century, Arabic script writing also flourished in Turkey, Persia, and China

 tantralok abhinavgupt dwaara rachit ek tantric granth he
 Disciples, allies and family environment, two reasons that inspired Abhinavagupta to write Tantralok, inspired him the most to write Tantralok, a very firm and reverent request by his disciples and classmates and a complete scriptural form under the command of his mentor 'somasambhu' or Shambhunath Began to write for abhinav tantralok upsanhaar main tantralok kii rachana sahaayak sadhanrup apane pradhan shishyo kaa ullekh kiya he
 Among them, his brother Manorath comes first
 jab manorath abhinav ke akhilshastravimarsh purna shambhavshakti ke ek maatr adhikari bane usee samay unke anya chachere bhai bhi samaan prarthana purvak abhinav ke paas upasthit ho krupa kii abhiyaachana kii
 Among these, the names of Sauram's sonamandra, Kshem, Utpal Abhinav, Chakrak, Padyagupta and Ramgupta are mentioned in detail
 kuch or logon ne abhinav se krupa kii yachana jise krupaluhridayvaale acharya abhinav asweekaar nahi kar sake, kintu unke naam kaa kahin varnan nahi miltaa he
 The names of Manorath, Karna and Utpal are taken in the epilogue shlokas of paratriatha description
 abhinav ke bhai manorath sarvashaastravetta tathaa shiv kii parabhakti se yukt the
 Karna was still young, however, he got away from worldly attractions and got serious entry into Shaiva discipline
 karn ne mandra ke saath abhinav se yah nivedan kiya tha ki ve ‘malinivijyottar’ tantra par ek tikaa likhe
 There was also a son named Yogeshwaridutt, far away from Karna's worldly instinct and with the same qualities as his name
 karn kii yuva patni, amba, jo ki abhinav kii bhagini bhi thi, ve apane pati kii alp avasthaa main hi mrityu ke baad samast lokeshnaon se mukt shivpadapa ke gahan bhakthi main pravisht ho chuki thi
 Although she was older than Abhinav, she considered Abhinav to be a guru and not a wise man
 aage ham ramgupta kaa varnan pate he jinhe abhinav ‘paratrinshika vivaran’ main ramdev kehete he
 According to Paratrinshika description, Ramdev was a master of grammar, epistemology and logic
 abhinav ke pancho chachere bhai jinka varnan abhinav ne upsanhaar shloke main kiya he ve sabhi samast vishyakarshanon ko nirast karte hue shiv kii purna bhakti main pravesh paa chuke the
 We are not able to prove clearly that the author of many famous texts and commentaries 'shebhraj' is his cousin Kshem or someone else, but some circumstantial evidence confirms this fact
 abhinavgupt in sabhi ko ‘ pitruvy tanyah’ kehete hue sambodhit karte he
 In Abhinav Tantralek, no one makes it clear that his uncle was a con
 dow ke0 si0 pandeya ‘abhinavbharti ke aadhaar par vamangupt ko abhinav kaa chachaa bataate he
 When we discuss the gurus of Abhinav, then this topic will be highlighted again
 ab ham mand ke upar aate hai ve karn ke baalyavastha ke mitra or chachere bhai hoge
 Vatsalika, who was the wife of Kisauri, Abhinav is called Bhandra's aunt and who was full of gracious personality
 abhinav ne inhi kii kripapurna vyaktitva se yukt thi
 Abhinav has graciously looked after him, considering his residence in a town a suitable place for his literary creation
 in sabhi longon kii samavet prarthana ne hi abhinav ko tantralok kii rachana hetu vivash kar diya us prarthana ko thik usee prakaar asweekaar nahi kar sake jaise ek nartki jo ki nartan kii icchhuk he kisi vaadyayantra ke vaadan ke samay apane upar niyantran nahi kar sakati
 Tantralok, the collection site of Tantralok, was written in the house of a temple located in a town where his aunt Vatsalika, while convincing her name, succeeded in writing her own superlative text for her
 acharya abhinav kaa kavi hriday, unke kavy kaa prayek shabd batsalika ke pratikritagyata se paripurna hokar vatsalika ke upar barasata he
 Vatsalika was the wife of Sauri's wife, who was the minister of state, and who later resigned after completing her devotion to Shiva
 abhinavgupt yadhyapi apane jeevanavrutt or paristhitiyon ke sambandh main paryaapt vivaran dete hai tathaapi ve apane samay ke sambandh main koi bhi pratyaksh sanket nahi dete hai
 Abhinav's position is clearly definite
 is vishay main hamen abhinav dwaara kuch sanket praapt hote hai souri abhinav se jyeshtha tathaa samakaleen the kyonki uttarkalin unki teen peediyaan souri karn or yogeshwaridatt dikhaai detii he
 Karna was certainly a contemporary of Abhinav
 abhinav kii bahan amba ke pati the
 Abhinav was an eyewitness to Karna's death
 karn, abhinav ke niwat sambandhi hone ke saath saath abhinav ke atyant jigyaasu shishy thi
 Karna died at a relatively young age when his son Yogeshwari Dutt had grown up
 ‘paratrinshika vivaran’ main vaarnit tathyon kii putr the jo samraat yashaskar kii sabha main varisht athwa pradhanmantri the
 Yashkar is definitely known that his reign was in 939 AD
 abhinavgupt samarat yashaskar ke tritiy peedi ke samay main tantralok kaa lekhan kaarykar rahe the
 At that time he was in a very mature state
 tathaa uski sweekrut tithi 950 se 1025 i0 main samaanveet hoti he
 The form of Tantralok is a demonstration that Tantralok is probably the most serious and original work of Abhinavagupta
 jabaki anek mahatvapurn tathaa samakaleen athwa purvavarti kritiyon par unki tikaayen hai
 Here the above facts can be seen in a mirror like a system like this - tantralok kaa vaishishty tantralok ke antahpraant tathaa chaturdik drushtipaat se hamen gambheer antajryaan se atyant deept uskaa vividh swaroop drusht hota he
 The author of the Rijuvimarshini of about the 12th century called it 'trikashastra' or 'trikasara Shastra' and as its illustration, he cites only the lines of Tantraloka
 atev aisa prathit hota he ki yah granth us samay tak trik parampara kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaala sarvaadhik mahatvapurn granth ho gaya tha
 The famous disciple of Abhinavagupta, Kshemraj, tells two important facts about this book - abhinavgupt ne tantrasar main sankshepatah varnan karte hue kaha he ki tantralok main vaidic vidhi, nishedhon se lekar shaiva, tantra, kul or trik parampara ke mat uplabdh hai
 This fact is repeatedly described in detail in Tantraloka
 antat tantralok kaa yah swaroop spasht ho jaataa he ki ‘‘trik-parampara’’ par abhinavgupt dwaara prastut yah ek maatr ativishisht or adhikrut granth he
 According to 'tantrasara', Tantraloka is not only the corpus of the Agam tradition, but it is a critical treatise for analyzing Tantra's mutual distinction of knowledge and inward distinction
 dhvanyalok kii lochan-tikaa main aa0 abhinav ke anusaar tantralok kaa kendriya bhav us paramsatta ke chaturdik ghumta he jise ‘anuttar’ kaha gaya he
 The main purpose of Tantraloka is to reveal and analyze it, defining the subject
 is prakaar tantralok ek tikaa kaa rup le letaa he
 Therefore, it has been called pratik, shloka pratik and conspiratorial
 sambhavtah aa0 abhinavgupt ko vaarthik naam dene kii prerana katyayan ke vaartikon se mili
 Where talk is defined as a reflection of the meaning of the above, the meaning and the meaning
 yah spasht dikhaayi detaa he ki tantralok is paribhaasha ko purnataya aatmsaat karata he kahin-kahin aa0 abhinavgupt ne tantralok ko agmadhaarit samast tikaa prakaaron kaa mishrit rup kaha he
 In this way, Tantraloka takes the form of simultaneous speech and instinct
 sambhavtah yahi kaaran he ki kinhi vishisht vishyon ke vyakhya or vishleshan ke sandarbh main tantralok pramanik granth kaha gaya he
 This Tantraloka is sometimes called 'tantraloka'
 abhinavgupt ne tantralok kii rachana vividh drushtiyon se kii
 The first and most influential reason was the classification of available Tantric literature and traditional tantra
 atah takneekee drushti se tantralok ek sangrah granth he
 The basic purpose of the work of A
 Abhinavagupta was to collect not only the tantric sources but also the three-dimensional tradition from the Agama literature
 Abhinav himself has considered in this context
 unka spasht uddeshy apane vichaaron ko aagam parampara ke saar ke rup main prastut karnaa tha jisamen ve sarvatha upyukt siddh hue
 Which Jayarath has endorsed by calling Abhinavagupta a collector
 aa0 abhinav dwitiya kintu atyant mahatvapurn uddeshy prakriya athwa paddati ko prastut karnaa tha
 Abhinavagupta was saddened by the absence of any method and process scripture in the a अनुडāक्रमaraडadhārākramā tradition, best recognized among the various principles and methods
 This vacancy was a matter of concern
 isaki sampoorti hetu aa0 abhinav ne prayek drushti se purna prakriya granth ke rup main likhane kaa nishchay kiya
 However, both Abhinavagupta and Vivek commentator Jairath of Tantraloka do not provide clear knowledge in terms of the style of process book
 tathaapi jayrath aa0 abhinavgupt ke prakriya granth rachanarup uddeshy kii soochna se paripurna hai
 In this context, 4 conclusions are available
 ab tantralok kaa prakriya se taatpary kya he ? yah dekhte hai
 If we look at the 14th and 15th verses of the first verse of Tantraloka, we find that the words process and method indicate the same meaning and the other noticeable fact is that both words refer to the texts of a particular class
 swaabhaavik rup main yahan vaiyakarnon kaa prakriya shabd kaa vyutpattiparak arth anakanksh he
 According to the Vachaspatyam, the word process means a chapter or a serialized episode
 jabaki shabdakalpadrup ke anusaar prakriya shabd kaa arth niyatvidhi he is prakaar yahan paddati ek nishchit bhavarth bodhak granth kaa rup le leti he
 Both the Vachspatiyam and the Shabdakalpadrup agree with this fact and cite Hemachandra's name for support
 in shabdkoshkaron ke anusaar prakriyagranth kisi vishay ke mulabhipraay ko vyakt karne hetu uski prakriya kaa prakaton karata he
 From the subtle study of Tantraloka, it becomes clear that the process theory of A
 Abhinav is very close to the definition of the said process
 abhinavgupt tantralok main ‘paratrishika’ ko anutarprakriya kehete hai
 This statement alone is sufficient to consider the paratroika details as well
 aa0 abhinavgupt anya sthanon par ‘prakriya’ shabd kaa prayog ‘sadhana’ ke artho main bhi karte he
 This fact becomes even more convincing when Abhinav Swachata Tantra quotes this statement as 'there is no better knowledge than process'
 jayrath prakriya bhed ke kaaran tantro me paraspar bhed ko spasht karte hue samast andeh nirast kar dete hai
 In this way, it can be clearly said that the text presenting the specific cultivation methods of law-prohibitive and method-prohibitive is called process texts
 jaisaa ki gyaat he abhinav is prakriya arth main dwitiya shabd paddati kaa prayog karte he
 But what was the ideal form of his method? It is unknown however, that he cites a method of 'ishanasiva' which presents the basic motif of the method and which is described in the Devyamala Granth
 yah ishanshiv nischitarup se gurudev paddati athwa tantra paddati ke rachayita apane samanaam ishanshiv se bhinn hai
 Which certainly happened after 1073 AD
 da0 ramachandra dvivedi ke anusaar ‘karmkandawali’ granth ke lekhak somashmbhu ‘ishanshiv’ ke paramguru the
 According to Kshemraj, Shiva, a teacher of Abhinav, wrote a method which Abhinav has quoted but did not mention his name, starting indirectly in this tradition
 yah sambhav he ki vibhinn paddatiyon tathaa unamem se ek kaa bhi unki parampara ko prastut na karnaa aa0 abhinav ke dukh kaa kaaran thi
 The famous text of the 'nath-sampradaya', 'siddhasiddhantapaddhati', which is very conservative, is full of quotations from the 'pratibhagya' sect and refers to the texts of the tradition in general
 is prakaar yah nishkarsh nikaalnaa tarksangat he ki tantralok prakriya athwa paddati granth he or ‘trik’ jeevandarshan kaa sarvangpurn niamak granth he
 Abhinava's third objective was to present Tantraloka as a perfect scripture or rule
 jaisaa ki parvarti samay main yah asandigdh rup se prakriya shaastra ke rup ko uplabdh ho gaya tha
 Hence Jayarath reminds Abhinavagupta as a frequent scribe
 jayrath apane adhivaakya tathaa vivek tikaa ke prarambh main tantralok ke shastreey swaroop ko nimnavat prastut karte hai
 Since the contract of any scripture is quadrangle, Jairath also establishes contractual contraction which is - 1
 Subject, 2
 Purpose, 3
 Officer, 4
 Relation
 inkaa kramik vivaran is prakaar he- Apart from this, Ganesh and Batuk have also been praised in the form of causal Mangalacharan form for the beginning of the dissolution of each scripture
 abhinav apane chaturth antim prayaas ke antargat ‘tantralok’ ko purnatah stuti granth ke rup main kendrit karte hai
 They do not leave any kind of doubt at the end of their undertaking sentences and initial preamble verses, and likewise in the epilogue verses
 unhen jab bhi avasar praapt hota he ve tantralok bhakthi tathaa samarpan bhaavon ko vyakt karte hai
 The Tantraloka in their eyes attains meaning with a holistic appearance when they are oriented towards Shaktipotik, the Shaivism
 tantralok is alolik bhavoplabdhi ke maarg tathaa prakriya donon kaa varnan ati spasht sahajata ke karata he
 With just as much ease, as a person's style of routine keeps on completing automatically, effortlessly
 ve sahjavastha ke charam shikhar par arudh hokar, agyanadhwant rahit apane anubhutiyon ko vakprasun ke madhyam se bekhari dharaatal par vikirnit karte hue kehete hai-‘‘jab koi is shaivi bhav se yukt ho jaataa he tab uske hriday ke sandehon ke megh swayammev chhin-bhinn ho jate hai or hridayakash main paramshivaroop gyaan kaa surya udit athwa prakaashmaan ho jaataa he
 This highly expressive statement of the Tantraalakara communicates faith in the hearts of the innovators and leads them to full attainment, who rise above the universe and are engrossed in the essence of metaphysics
 maatr isi gahanbhaktipurna bhaavana dwaara hi tantralok ke prakriyaatmak swaroop kii vivechna kii ja sakati he
 Probably this approach has been glorified in the undertaking and epilogue of Tantraloka
 tantralok ke sookshm adhyayan se hamen is rachana ke peeche aa0 abhinavgupt ke uddeshy kaa spashtatah bodh hota he
 a new all-purpose objective is the attainment of Bhairava Bhavavavabhada or Bhairava identification
 aa0 abhinav yah sagarv udghoshnaa karte hai ki tantralok ke 37 ahnikon main vanart vishay kaa nirantar abhyaas karanevaala saakshaat bhairav swaroop ho jaayegaa aa0 abhinav samast tantralok main is uddeshy se ranch-maatr bhi skhlit nahin hote hai aa0 abhinav anuswaroop jeev ke chaitanya ke vikaas kaa path nirdisht karte hue uske anutv ke vilay purvak swatmapratyabhigyaan dwaara brahmandswarupata kii prapti ke madhya aanevaale samast sopanon kaa kramik vishleshan karte hai
 A
 Abhinav does not get tired of calling his priorities time and again
 ve kehete hai ki tantralok main unki vaastavik patibaddhta anuttarajipti kii prastuti ke saath he
 The enlightenment that is the cause of liberation is designed for the rise of all belief and full spirit
 aa0 abhinav dhvanyalok kii lochantika main yah uddhrut karte hai ki tantralok kaa kendriya bhav us advay parmeshwar bhav kii siddhi he
 According to A
 Abhinav, the only force of power is the driving force of Mumukha
 ve bandhan se mukti kii samasya ke samaadhaan ke prati sarvaadhik sachet hai
 As the Abhinavas go ahead by clarifying that Tantraloka is basically a self-knowledgeist form, a genius
 is pratibh samvedan ke abhyaas ke samanantar sampoorn bodh hone ke kaaran vyakti ‘pratibh guru’ ho jaataa he jiske ‘krupa-kataaksh’ maatr se samast jagat bhairav taadaatmayata ko praapt ho saktaa he
 Both Abhinav and Tantralok commentator Jairath do not consider it to be praise for their work, but say that the above statement is true
 tantralok kii prastuti antim adhikrut granthrup anya uddeshy ko saamne laata he
 Self realization is the ultimate goal of all spiritual communities and the most important reason for this is introspection
 is sarvocch vaiyaktik uplabdhi main tantralok se bhinn kii anya granth kii kaaranta sakasham nahin he
 The autonomy of A
 Abhinav, the unfailing reasoner in Hayopadaya's decision, the absolute authority over all theology and the deep knowledge of the triad-tradition, all of them are oriented towards the same unanswered element, and all are interconnected, the deep seriousness and the very elaboration of the rendering of A
 Abhinav
 Provide
 koi bhi gyaan anubhuti str ko praapt karne tak teen str ko praapt hota he
 Jairath gives an indirect indication that the intellectual and spiritual splendor of Aat Abhinav, his sastramukhagam-nijanubhavibasiddha Swatam Sanvishit form reveals the cosmic personality with full knowledge
 katipay paristhitiyon vash nahin, varan yatharthatah tantralok ek adarshapurna tathaa pramanik granth he jo ki trik-parampara kaa prastota he
 A
 Abhinav considers the simple presentation of tantric methods and knowledge by Tantraloka as the third objective
 is bindu ko dhyaan main rakhte hue unhone unheen vishyon or avadharanaon ko apni vivechna kaa vishay banaaya
 So that everyone can benefit
 inhone vivaadit vishyon ko prastut karte hue uski saral vyakhya kii
 Careful observation of Tantraloka has another objective view of Abhinav in the background of the compilation which has been established very carefully
 ‘vah trik tantra parampara kaa niyaman or suraksha he
 'out of his three examples, the first at the beginning of Tantraloka' Sampradayochitzhitai 'and the remaining two' Vidambita 'in the Madhyas and the corrupt ones are clearly explained by his view
 prarambh se aa0 abhinav yah suchit karte hai ki kuch log jo shastron main pandit the parantu parampararahit hone ke kaaran trikgyanopalabdh nahi ho sake
 The second example implies that there were some people who neither studied the scriptures nor waited or searched for the mentor
 is prakaar saralata se digbhramit ho gaye
 The third quotation indicates that specific and essential parts of some traditional knowledge have either disappeared or become distorted such that the exploration of their original form was impossible
 pratham tathaa dwitiya avasthaa main aa0 abhinav ne apane parmparik gyaan or medha kaa prayog kiya tritiy avasthaa main unhone anya vikalpon ke rup main ‘nyaas-vidhi’ kaa prayog kiya jise ‘malini’ kaha he
 Jairath Tantralok testifies that wherever Abhinav quotes a forward tradition and opinion, he contradicts the contrary and illusory concept and installs it in its true form by its unique merit
 Huh
 is prakaar ukt strot se sanmbandhit gyaan ko or samrudh karte he
 Under this discussion, we come to the conclusion that one of the aims of Abhinav was to make available and safeguarding the future for the future by reviving traditional Tantric literature and practice
 is sandarbh unki style or vidhiyo kaa pareekshan karte hue kuch or tathy kahe ja sakate hai
 By focusing on the facts mentioned earlier, we can divide the purpose and efforts of Abhinav into two categories
 First 1
 Declared 2
 Second undeclared, which can be called briefly as follows
 kaaran 1
 Announced - 1
 sarabhag ke rup main 2
 As a process book 3
 stuti ke rup main Underlined uddeshy - 1
 swatm pratybhigyaan or dusro ko bhi isi hetu unmukh karnaa Declared - Presentation of the enlightenment due to the accomplishment of liberation 2
 parmparik tantragyan kaa saral vivechan Announced - Presentation of the last authorized book of literature and literature of Tantric tradition 1

 His role is similar to the Legislative Chairman of any other system of governance based on the Westminster system
 uskaa nirvachan loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad, loksabhaa kii pratham baithak main hi kar liya jaataa he
 He is elected from among the members of Parliament for five years
 usase apeksha kii jaati he ki vah apane rajanithik dal se istipha de de, taaki kaarywahi main nishpakshta bani rahe
 The current Speaker of the Lok Sabha is Mrs
 Sumitra Mahajan, who is the second woman official of the post, after her predecessor, Meira Kumar
 loksabhaa adhyaksh kaa nirvachan loksabhaa ke sadasyon ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The date of the election is decided by the President
 raashtrapati ke dwaara nishchit kii gayi tithi kii soochna loksabhaa kaa mahasachit sadasyon ko detaa he
 a proposal is made in writing to the secretary-general to elect another member of the Speaker before midday one day before the date of election
 yah prastaav kisi tisare sadsy dwaara anumodith hona chahie
 This statement is accompanied by the statement of the candidate member of the Speaker that he is ready to act as the Chairman
 nirvachan ke liye ek yaa adhik ummidavaaron dwaara prastaav kiye ja sakate hai
 If only one motion is moved, the election of the Speaker is unanimous and if more than one motion is presented, a vote is held
 matdaan main loksabhaa ke sadsy hi shaamil hokar adhyaksh kaa bahumat se nirvachan karte hai
 The Speaker of the Lok Sabha takes oath as a member just like other Lok Sabha members
 uskaa shapath bhi kaaryakari adhyaksh dwaara karaayaa jaataa he
 The executive chairman is made up of the most senior members
 loksabhaa-adhyaksh loksabhaa ke satron kii adhyakshata karata he or sadan ke kaamkaaj kaa sanchaalan karata he
 He decides whether a bill is a money bill or not
 vah sadan kaa anushaasan or maryaada banaae rakhata he or isamen baadha pahunchaane vaale saansadon ko dandit bhi kar saktaa he
 He allows various types of motions and resolutions, such as no-confidence motions, adjournment motions, censor motions, to be brought and notice notices
 adhyaksh hi yah tay karata he ki sadan kii baithak main kya agenda liya janaa he
 The Speaker of the Lok Sabha receives the same monthly salary and other allowances as the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
 may, 2002 ko sansad dwaara paarit ek sanshodhan vidheyak ke anusaar yadi loksabhaa ke adhyaksh kii mrityu uske pad par rahane kii avadhi main hi ho jaati he to uske parivaar yani pati yaa patni ko pension, awaas or swasthya suvidhaayen mila karengi
 It is noteworthy that this facility was till now only for the posts of President and Vice President
 saath hi loksabhaadhyaksh ko kendriya mantri ke samaan bhatta dene kaa bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 The term of the Speaker is till the dissolution of the Lok Sabha
 kuch sthitiyon main vah isse pehle bhi padmukt ho saktaa he-loksabhaa adhyaksh ko loksabhaa ke prabhavi bahumat dwaara hataaya ja saktaa he
 But it is necessary to inform the Speaker of Lok Sabha 14 days in advance

 It has been an important center of city life since the fourteenth century

 Several main buildings are located on John mcintosh Chowk, of which the Gibraltar Parliament and City Hall are the most prominent

 Later it was named Alameda

 The epic related to the birth of Kumarasambhava Mahakavi Kalidasa Virchita Karthikeya, which is counted in the Panch epics of Sanskrit
 is mahakavy main anek sthalon par smaraneey or manoram varnan hua he
 The descriptions of Himalayavarna, penance of Parvati, Shivninda of Brahmachari, arrival of spring, marriage of Shivparvati and rituals generate wonderful feeling
 kalidas kaa bala parvati, tapaswini parvati, vinayavati parvati or pragalbh parvati aadi roopon nari kaa chithran adbhut he
 This epic has ended in 17 cantos, but the folk belief is that only the first eight cantos are composed by Kalidas
 baad ke anya nau sarg anya kavi kii rachana he aisa mana jaataa he
 Some people believe that the poem ends in eight cantos only with the premonition of Kumar's birth with Shivparvati Samagam
 kuch log kehete hai ki aathven sarg me shivparvati ke sambhog kaa varnan karne ke kaaran kalidas ko kusht ho gaya or ve likh na sake
 There is also a view that his intercourse did not interest the public, so he did not write further
 isamen varnit katha sankshep main is prakaar he- Parvatraj was the son of Manak of Himalayas and a girl named Gauri
 kanya parvati or uma naam se bhi vikhyath hui
 When Kanya was born, Narada came to her house one day and predicted that the girl would be married to Shiva
 yah bhavishyavaanee sunakar himalay nishcint ho gaye
 On the other hand, Shiva was doing penance at the peak of the Himalayas
 himalay ne ek sakhi ke saath uma ko unki paricharya ke liye bhej diya or uma bhakthibhaav se shiv kii seva karne lagi
 In those days, the gods were defeated in the battle with Tarakasura
 daitya anek prakaar ke chal karne laga
 Then all the gods including Indra came to Brahma
 tarakasur ke nimit yogya senapati kii maang kii
 Then Brahma said that only a man born with Shankar's semen can be your worthy general
 isliye tum log prayaas karo jisase shiv parvati ke prati aasakt hon
 If Shiva accepted Parvati, then if you have a son with Parvati, then you will win if you become his commander
 tatpashchaat indradi devtaa shiv ke virakt bhav ko hataane ke upaay par vichaar karne ke liye ekatra hue
 When Madan came to that meeting, Indra requested him to accompany his friend Vasanth to the austerity place of Shiva and enchant Shiva with Parvati
 tadnusaar madan apni patni rati or mitra vasant ko lekar shankar ke ashram main pahunchaa
 When Parvati reached near Shiva to offer the garland of Kamalbees and Shiva raised his hand to take her, Madan offered a bow to his bow
 tatkshan shiv kaa man vichlit hua
 Shankar thus looked around to find out the reason of sudden distortion of mind
 unhen sharasandhan karata madan dikhaai padaa
 Shiva became furious after seeing her; Agnijwala appeared from his third eye and Madan consumed him
 rati apane pati ko is prakaar bhasma hote dekh vilaap karne lagi or vasant se chita taiyaar karne ko kaha or swayan praan tyaagane ko taiyaar hui
 Then there was a voice from heaven that you will have patience and you will receive your address 
 udhar shiv narisampark se bachane ke liye antardhan ho gaye
 With Madan being consumed and Shiva being impregnated, Parvati saw all her desires fail and thinking that this beauty was futile, she went to a mountain peak to appease Shiva and started doing intense penance
 kuch kaal ke ananthar shiv kaa man pighla unhone parvati ko sweekaar karne kaa vichaar kiya
 But before that he decided to test Parvati and he reached the ashram of an ascetic
 parvati ne atithi ke rup main unka samuchit satkar kiya
 Then the Tarun ascetic inquired of Parvati, for whom she was doing such austere penance
 atithi ke prashn ko sunakar parvati lajjit hui or apane manobhaav prakat karne me sankoch karne lagi tab unki sakhi ne shiv kii prapti kii ichha kii baat kahi
 Hearing this, the ascetic Shiva, condemning him by mentioning Shiva's fortifications and ugliness etc
 parvati ko yah shiv ninda nahi hui or unhe daantne lagi
 Then Shiva appeared in his form and held his hand
 tatpashchaat shiv ne saptarshi ke bulaakar himalay ke paas bheja
 He told them that Shiva had expressed his desire to take Parvati's accession
 tab vivaah kaa nishchay hua or vivaah kii taiyaari hone lagi
 The Saptamatrakas brought the groom's clothes, but Shiva did not accept them all and walked on Nandi
 pashchaat vivaah kii sari kriyaayein hui
 Upon completion of the marriage, Parvati, including Shiva, bowed to Brahma
 brahma ne aashirwad diya
 You are a brave son
 apsaraon ne aakar var-vadhu ke sammukh ek naatak prasttut kiya
 After the play ends Indra requests Shiva to bring Madan alive

 It should be favored by the workers, peasants and the whole oppressed masses
 It involves the common people
" 'S sorrow, happiness, their wishes and aspirations should be expressed in such a way that their iniquity powers At the force and that they can build a united and organized through successful their struggle

 aryaashtangmarg mahatma buddha kii pramukh shikshaaon main se ek he jo dukhon se mukti paane evam aatm-gyaan ke saadhan ke rup main bataaya gaya he
 All the 'routes' of the Ashtanga Marg begin with the word 'samyak'
 buddha pratikon main praayah ashtaang margon ko dharmachakr ke aath tadiyon dwaara nirupit kiya jaataa he
 Part of the category of buddha dharm ke anusaar, chauthe arya satya kaa arya ashtaang maarg he - dukh nirodh paane kaa rasta
 Gautama Buddha used to say that to follow the truth of the Four Noble Truths, one should follow this path: kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha said that craving is the root cause of all sorrows
 trishna ke kaaran sansar kii vibhinn vastuon kii ore manushya pravrutt hota he; or jab vah unhen praapt nahin kar saktaa athwa jab ve praapt hokar bhi nasht ho jaati hai tab use du:kha hota he
 a creature who dies with craving, still takes birth from his inspiration and keeps grinding in the misery of the world
 at: trishna kaa sarvatha prahaan karne kaa jo maarg he vahi mukti kaa maarg he
 This is called grief-prevention-gamini pratipada
 bhagavan buddha ne is maarg ke aath ang bataae hai : The first two parts of this path are of Pragya and the last two are of Samadhi
 bich ke chaar sheel ke hai
 In this way, Sheel, Samadhi and Pragya become the input of the eight organs in these three
 sheel shuddh hone par hi aadhyatmik jivan main koi pravesh paa saktaa he
 Mumukshu meditates on the basis of pure modesty and avails samadhi and in samadhistha state, he is interviewed with truth
 ise pragna kehete hai, jiske udbuddha hote hi sadhak ko satta maatr ke anitya, anaam or du:khaswaroop kaa saakshaatkaar ho jaataa he
 Its ignorance is destroyed in the light of wisdom
 isse sansar kii sari trishnaayen chali jaati hai
 Veetrishna, he does not ego anywhere and happiness rises above the bond of sorrow
 is jivan ke ananthar, trishna ke na hone ke kaaran, uske phir janm grahan karne kaa koi hetu nahin rahata
 Thus, the sheela-samadhi-pragyawala route divided into eight limbs is called the Arya Ashtanga path

 ustad-jamoore ke tamaashe ko anya naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he, jaise kii madari-jamoora, ustad-baccha or madari-chela
 Because the work of Jamur is to be avoided without the advice of his master, in the folk culture of India and Pakistan, if any man or institution is silently obeying the orders of another person, then it is called contemptuous

 Open source is the process of production, expansion and development of any material in which the process of production is completely open
 isamen strot ko prakashit kiya evam badhaava diya jaataa he
 At the beginning of this concept it was limited to computer software only, under which the source code of various software was distributed free of charge and thus the user had access to the source code of the software
 iske antargat upayoktaaon ko kisi bhi anuprayog ke vikaas kii prakriya main bhaag lene, ise badalane va isamen kisi bhi prakaar kaa sudhaar kar phir swayan vitarit karne kaa adhikaar bhi miltaa tha
 In this way, any person was free to use it to create new and changed software at his convenience
 iske kisi prakaar ke prayog par koi nishedh nahin hota he
 In this way, open source is not limited to just software but has access to all types of works, such as articles, pictures, music and movies
 software udyog main mukt strot kaa vichaar sarvapratham 1990 ke dashak main aayaa tha, jab kai companiyon ne apane software, prachaalan tantra aadi mukt strot rup main jari kiye the
 It started with Linux

 It has many levels
 kai companiyaan mukt strot ko jari karte samay uske saath kuch kuch pratibandh yaa sharten aadi laga detii hai taaki uskaa durupyog na ho sake
 The main advantage of Open Source is that due to its source code available to the consumer, he can use it as per his wish and requirement
 appal aadi kai companiyaan apni takneekon ko mukt strot license ke dwaara jari karti hai jiske aivaj main upabhoktaaon se wo paise leti hai
 About a year ago, Google phones came in the market using Android operating system

 The purpose behind Open Source is that any product can be developed and the errors and shortcomings contained therein are not as much as the manufacturer can do as quickly and quickly as possible

 Temperature measurements using modern scientific thermometers and temperature scales were invented in the early 18th century, when Gabriel Fahrenheit adopted a thermometer and scale developed by Ole Christensen Roemer
 celsius paimaana or kelvin paimaane ke atirikt, farenheit paimaana kaa upyog ab bhi kiya jaataa he
 Several methods have been developed to measure temperature
 inamen se adhikansh bhinn taapmaana vaale kaaryvahak padaarth ke kuch bhautik sampattiyon ko maapne par aadhaarit hai
 The most common instrument for measuring temperature is a glass thermometer
 yah kaanch ke tub kaa bana hota he or iske andar paara yaa koi anya dravya maujuud hota he, jo kaaryvahak dravya ke rup main kaary karata he
 The temperature increases due to the expansion of mercury, so the temperature can be measured by measuring the volume of the fluid
 aise tharmametre aam taur par anshaankit hote hai taaki koi bhi tharmametre main drav ke str ko dekh kar taapmaana aasaani se pard sake
 tharmametre kaa ek anya prakaar gas tharmametre he, jiskaa upyog aamtaur par bahu kam hota he, lekin saidhantik rup se iskaa bahut mahatv he
 Other important instruments for measuring temperature are the following: taapmaana maapte samay yah sunishchit karne ke liye saavdhaan rahanaa chahie ki maapan yantra kaa taapmaana us padaarth ke taapmaana ke samaan he, jise mapa janaa he
 In some situations, the temperature of the measuring instrument can affect the temperature gradient, so the measured temperature may be different from the actual temperature of the substance
 aisi sthiti main, mapa gaya taapmaana na keval padaarth ke taapmaana se bhinn hota he, balki padaarth ke ooshmaa sthanantaran gun se bhi bhinn hota he
 The extreme condition of this effect increases the wind chill factor, where even if the temperature is the same, the weather becomes cold due to the windy and cool conditions
 aisi sthiti main, hawa sharir ke ooshmaa sthanantaran kii dar ko badha detii he, jiske parinamswaroop samaan vyapak taapmaana par sharir kaa taapmaana kam ho jaataa he
 The theoretical basis of thermometers is the zero principle of thermodynamics, the concept of which is that if you have three objects A, b and C, and a and b have the same temperature, and b and c have the same temperature, then the temperature of a and c is also Will be the same
 Where, b is a thermometer
 taapmaana ke maapan kaa vyaavhaarik aadhaar teen bindu koshanu kaa astitv main hona he
 Tri dots are conditions of pressure, volume and temperature, so tri-phases are continuously present, for example solids, steam, and liquids
 For a single component, any change in three variable results in one or more phases missing from the tri point and the cell does not occur in an independent state
 isliye, trigun bindu koshanuon kaa upyog taapmaana or daab ke saarvbhaumik sandarbh ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 In some situations, temperature measurement is possible using direct Planck's theory on dark matter radiation
 udhaaharan ke liye, cosmik sookshm tarang prishthbhumi taapmaana ko upgrah avlokan jaise WMAP dwaara awalokit photone ke pratibimb se mapa ja saktaa he
 In the study of quark-gluon plasma by means of single particle spectra, the dense collision of an ion, sometimes referred to as a thermometer

 The thermometer should be positioned 1
25–2 m above the ground
 Detailed information about this setup can be obtained from the World Meteorological Organization

 moulik granth: Commentary: yivu china main navviksit ho rahe ek vishaltam vyavsaayik shahar kaa naam he
 It is written and called Yiwu in the English language, which is clearly spoken and heard in all languages in the pronunciation of the name Yivu
 yah shahar china ke dakshin purvi kshetra ke sameep jhijiang naamak praant main sthit he
 China is the most important and largest commercial city among the huge industrial and commercial cities developing after 1998
 gat do daskon ke interval hi yah shahar duniyon ke vishaltam vyavsaayik shaharon main vishisht rup main prakhyat ho chukaa he
 It is well known that the history, civilization and culture of China is nothing less than ancient
 thik isi tarah prastut yivu naamak shahar ke viksit hone se purv is kshetra kii aitihaasik prishtabhumi bhi pracheen hi he
 Whose history is detailed
 yah kuch-kuch pahari kshetra hone ke kaaran yahon ke adhikosh nivasee varshon purv se hi vyavsaayik gatividhiyon se jude the, parantu unka mukhya vyavsaay krishi tha
 Over the years, China was moving towards economic revolution, during this period, the Chinese government started the foundation of the plan to develop Yiwu
 tatpashchaat is shahar kaa san 2002-03 se kayakalp ho gaya
 The government of China began allocating commercial centers and large demonstration centers around the year 2005 for the general public and business houses
 dekhte hi dekhte ek dashak ke bheetar hi yivu kii gananaa duniyon ke vishaltam vyavsaayik shahra main hone lag gai
 Today, Yiwu has established its important place as a popular center for business people from all over the world
 yahon par yah baat bhi dhyaan rakhane yogya he ki san 2010 ke aas-paas jab; china ne is yivu shahar ko duniyon ke maanchitr main sammilit kiya to, yah jaanakar, pashchimi deshon kii ankhen khuli kii khuli rah gayin thim
 Yiwu is located in a hotbed area of china
 yah china ke dakshin purvi kshetra ke sameep jhijiang naamak vishaal praant ke antargat he
 Another commercial city is near Dongyang
 is shahar ke aas-pahari kshetra bhi he
 But the mountains are not huge and dense
 ise silaai mashin kalpurjon ke shahar se lagbhag 60-70 kilometre kii duuri par bhi kah sakate he
 The most important feature of this largest commercial city named Yivu is that it is here that the businessmen and traders of domestic commodities get complete information about all the commodities from all over the world
 samooche china ke gharelu upyogi vastuon ke nirmaataaon ke utpaada yahon maujuud hote hai
 There are about 20 to 35 thousand shops in each floor of every building
 ek manzil main itani adhik dukaanon main ek hi tarah kaa saamaan miltaa he
 For example, things related to the application of women's hair on a floor, internal confinement of women on a floor, beauty cosmetics for women on a floor, only women's shoes on a floor, only newborns on a floor Toys, only newborn clothes on a floor, only newborn toys on a floor, newborn toys only on a floor Is not sleeping Stores
 yahaan par kharid-daari naa ke baraabar paayi jaati he
 All these shops are related to big small industrial houses
 jinhen angreji main only for display kehane main koi atishyokti nahin ho sakati
 Mostly there are purchase orders here and the goods are supplied from the manufactured factories only
 vishesh baat yah bhi he ki yivu shahar keval gharelu upyogi vastuon kaa vyavsaayik kendra he
 The city is devoid of the business of heavy industry, machinery and machine parts
 kuch hi varshon ke dauraan yivu naamak vyavsaayik shahar china ke puraane-prasiddh vyavsaayik shahar guwangjhau se pehle khadaa aane laga he
 Even after being self-sufficient in this display business of household utilities, from time to time, international exhibitions of these items have also been organized
 jisamen duniyon ke prayek kone-kone se vyapaaree log aane lage hai
 Opening of China to foreigners started in 1998
 kuch hi varshon main yivu vyavsaayik shahar ne teevr gati se pragati kii
 In the first half of 2017, a freight rail service called East Wind from Yewu to London has started
 is railway line kii lambaai lagbhag baarah hajaar kilometre he
 This freight train reaches London from Yiwu via Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Belgium and France in about 18-20 days, carrying about 10,000 to twenty thousand cargo containers and unloading the goods at the above seven junctions Reaches london yivu naamak vishaltam vyavsaayik shahar lagbhag 1200 se 1500 varg kilometre tak viksit ho chukaa he tathaa aage or vikaas gati par hi he

 The construction of the main buildings in the central jivu is only from three to five floors
 prayek manzil main 30-35 hajaar ke lagbhag dukaane hai
 Apart from this central city, the expansion of the city is constantly moving
 adhikash log yahi samajhate hai ki china main aapasi vaartalap main prayog hone vaali bhashaa ko chinis kaha jaataa he
 But it is not so, the most spoken language here is called mandarin
 yivu tathaa yivu ke aasapaas ke kshetron kii boli-bhashaa ko bhi maindarin kaha jaataa he
 The language of speaking and writing in official business is Chinese
 cantnij bhashaa kaa bhi prachlan mil jaataa he, parantu angreji kaa prayog yada-kada hi mil paata he
 Boards of every business place and place are found in Chinese language only

85 mamarkha handiya, elahabaad, uttar pradesh sthit ek gaanv he
 Ashok Yadav was an MLA in the Fifteenth Assembly of Uttar Pradesh, India

 The Shrutasutra is a Vedic text and is in fact the Kalpavidhana of the Vedic ritual
 shrautasutra ke antargat havan, yag, ishtiyaan evam satr prakalpit hai
 Aphrodisiac and parlokic fruits are obtained by them
 shrautasutra unheen vedavihit karmon ke anushthan kaa vidhaan kare hai jo shrout agni par aahitagni dwaara anushthey hai
 The word 'shrout' is derived from 'shruti'
 ye rachanaayen divyadarshi karmnishth maharishiyon dwaara sutarastyli main rachit granth hai jinpar parvarti yaajik vidwaanon ke dwaara pranit bhashya evam tikaayen tathaa tadupakaarak paddatiyaan evam anek nibandhgranth uplabdh hai
 Thus the available sutras and their commentaries adequately attest how prominent their place has been in Indian literature
 paashchaatya manishiyon ko bhi shrout sahitya kii mahatta ne adhyayan kii ore aavarjit kiya jiske falswaroop paashchaatya vidwaanon ne bhi anek anargh sanskaran sampadit kiye
 The major Shrutasutra texts are: shrutivihit karm ko 'shrout' evam smritivihit karm ko 'smart' kehete hai
 The method of ritual of Shrout and Smarta Karmas is controlled by Vedang Kalpa
 vedang chah hai or unamem kalp pramukh he
 Panini education calls him 'the hand of the Vedas'
 kalp ke antargat shrautasutra, grihyasutra, dharmasutra or shulbasutra samavisht hai
 These include the process of constructing the Yagyashala, Vedi, Mandapa and Kunda required in the legislation of Shrutasutra Srutakarma, the legislation of Grihyasutra Smrtakarma, the law of Dharmasutra topical ethics and the Karma for the purpose of Shulbasutra Karmanushthan
 shrautasutra ke anusaar anushthanon kii do pramukh sansthaayen hai jinhen havi:sanstha tathaa somsanstha kehete hai
 Smarta is the culinary institution on fire
 in teenon sansthaaon main saat saat prabhed hai jinke yoga se 21 sansthaayen prachlit hai
 Havis: In the institution, the deity is sacrificed for the purpose of special devotion
 somsanstha main shrautagni par somras kii aahuti kii jaati he tathaa pashwalanbhan bhi vihit he
 Therefore they are animal husbandry
 in sansthaaon ke atirikt agnichayan, rajasuya or ashwamedh prabhruti yag tathaa saraswatsatra prabhruti satr evam kamyeshtiyaan hai
 There are two major distinctions of Sroutakarma
 nityakarm jaise agnihotrahavan tathaa naimitikarm jo kisi prasangvash athwa kaamnavishesh se prerit hokar yajmaan karata he
 Yajman himself, along with his wife, is tortured by the aid of the Ritvijas
 yajmaan dwaara kiye janevaale kriyalap, rutvijon ke kartavya, prayek karm ke aradhy devtaa, yag ke upyukt dravya, karm ke ang evam upangon kaa sangopang varnan tathaa unka paurvapary kram, vidhi ke viparyay kaa praayshchitt or vidhaan ke prakaar kaa vidhiwat vivaran shrautasutra kaa ekmaatr lakshya he
 There are some karma prakritikarmas in the creations
 inke sangopag anushthan kii prakriya kaa vivaran shrautasutron ne pratipaadit kiya he
 The deeds whose main process is bound in the framework of the natural nature, according to the research of the particular fruit, only the specific deity or substance and period, etc
, are the only discourse, they are perverted, because according to Shrutasutra, this order has been given to 'do distortions like nature'
 is prakaar shrautasutron ke pratipaadya vishay kaa aayam gambhir evam jatil ho gaya he, kaaran karmanushthan main prayek vihit ang evam upang ke sambandh main die hue niyamon kaa pratipaalan atyant kathorta ke saath kiya janaa adrusht fal kii prapti ke liye anivaary he
 The association of the four Vedas in the ritual of Shrutakarma is anticipated
 rugveda ke dwaara hotrutv, yajurveda ke dwaara adhvaryukarm, samaveda ke dwaara udgaatrutiv tathaa atharvaveda ke dwaara brahma ke kaary kaa nirvaah kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, Shrutasutra belongs to Vedchatutashyay
 yajmaan jis veda kaa anuyaayi hota he us veda athwa us veda kii shakha kii pramukhataa he
 For this reason, in the Yajnya kalpa, according to every direction, they are discerned, which have the effect of acceptable characteristics like deshachar, kulachar etc
 is kaaran karmanushthan kii prakriya main kuch avaantar bhed shakhabhed ke kaaran chalaa aa rahaa he or har shakha kaa yajmaan apane apane veda se sambhddha kalp ke anushaasan se niyantrit rahata he
 Due to this tradition, the Shrutasutras are also segregated according to the main branch of Vedchatutashiyi

 bandipur, jise kabhi-kabhi bandipora or bandpur bhi kehete hai, bharat ke jammu va kashmir rajya ke bandipur zile main sthit ek shahar he jo us zile kaa mukhyalay bhi he
 It is situated at the northern end of the Wullar lake, where the Madhumati river descending from the Harmukh mountain comes and empties into the Wullar
 aatithy ek mehmaan tathaa mejabaan ke madhya sambandh athwa satkarshiltaa kaa krity athwa prachlan he
 That is, guests, visitors or strangers; There are shelters, membership clubs, conventions, attractions, special events reception and entertainment and other services for travelers and tourists
 "aatithy" kaa aashay un logon ke prati dekhbhaal tathaa dayalutaa pradaan karnaa bhi ho saktaa he jinako isaki aavashyaktaa he
 The English word hospitality, meaning hospitality, originates from the Latin word hospes; And hospes originated from hostis, which means power
 Literally "host" means "lord of strangers", hostire means equal or recompense
 homeric kaal main aatithy unani devkul ke mukhya devtaa jiyas ke aadhin tha
 Zeus has also been conferred the title of 'genius Zaus' which emphasizes the fact that hospitality was the most important
 ek unani ghar ke baahar sejrane vaale kisi ajanabi ko parivaar dwaara ghar ke andar aamantrit kiya ja saktaa tha
 The host could ask the stranger's name only after washing his feet, offering food and wine, and after the guest was comfortable
 pavitra aatithy kii unani dharna kii vyakhya telemacas tathaa nestor kii kahani main kii gai he
 When Telemachus arrives to meet Nestor, Nestor is unaware that his guest is the son of his old friend Odysseus
 lekin phir bhi nestor ne telemacas tathaa uski party kaa muktahast se swaagat kiya, is prakaar hostis "ajanabi" tathaa hostire "samatuly yaa baraabar" ke madhya sambandh kaa pradarshan kiya ki kis tarah aatithy kii dharna main ye do milte hai
 Later, one of Nestor's sons slept on a bed close to Telemachus, taking care that he had no trouble
 nestor ne ek buggi tathaa ghode bhi telemacas ke liye chode jisase vah payalas se sparta tak thal maarg se yatra kar saken tathaa apane putr pisistratas ko sarathi ke rup main niyukt kiya
 It explains rescue and guidance, two other components of ancient Greek hospitality
 uparokt kahani tathaa uske vartmaan arth ke aadhaar par aatithy kaa taatpary ajanabi ko mejabaan ke baraabar / samatuly rakhana, uski dekhbhaal karnaa tathaa use surakshit mahasoos karana hota he, tathaa uski mejabani ke ant main use agle padaav kaa maargdarshan pradaan karnaa hota he
 Hospitality in the contemporary West is rarely a matter of rescue and survival, and is mostly related to etiquette and entertainment
 haalanki isamen aaj bhi apane atithi ke liye aadar pradarshit karnaa, unki aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karnaa tathaa unako baraabar kaa maananaa shaamil he
 The display of hospitality to strangers varies from cultures and subcultures compared to individual friends and members of one's group
 aatithy seva udyog main hotel, kisino evam ashrayasthal shaamil hai jo ajanabiyon ko aaraam tathaa nirdesh pradaan karte hai, lekin keval vyapaar sambandhon ke bhaag ke rup main
 hospital, hospice evam hostel shabd bhi "hospitality" se liye gayi hai tathaa ye santhaan vyaktigat dekhbhaal kii ore adhik ishaara karte hai
 Hospitality behavior is a subject that studies the use of hospitality
 pashchimi sandarbh main, athens tathaa jerusalem ke madhya gatisheel tanaav ke saath do avasthaaon main adhik pragatisheel sankraman ke saath antar dekha ja saktaa he: ek vyaktigat kartavya bodh mahasoos karne ke aadhaar par aatithy tathaa ek sangathit parantu agyaat saamaajik sevaaon ke liye sarkari sansthaanon par aadhaarit hota he: jinamein garib, anaath, biimaar, videshi, apradhi aadi vishesh prakaar ke ajanabiyon hetu vishesh sthaan he
 Perhaps, this progressive institutionalization can be aligned with the transition between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period
 "I am going to get you a pillow and make you feel real good" can be an example of hospitality
 yah atithi ke aatithy ko darshata he
 In Middle Eastern culture, caring for strangers and foreigners living among you was considered a cultural norm
 ye mandand bible sambandhi kai aagyaaen tathaa udaahranon main pratibimbit kiye gayi hai
 Perhaps the most extreme example is given in Genesis
 ishwar, farishton ke samooh ko aatithy pradaan karata he ; jab bheed unka balaatkaar karne kaa prayaas karti he to ve is had tak chale jate hai ki ve farishton ke sthaan par apni putriyon ko prastut kar dete hai
 Saying, "do nothing with these people, because they have come to my shelter
" " There are strict obligations for both host and guest
 yah bandhan ek chat ke neeche namak khaakar sthapit kiya jaataa he, tathaa itnaa kathor hota he ki ek arabi kahani bataati he ki ek chor ne ek vastu kaa swaad yah soch kar chakhaa ki vah chini he tathaa, yah jaanakar ki vah namak he, usne wo sabhi chijen vahaan waapas rakh deen jo usne uthaai thim tathaa chalaa gaya
 For the ancient Greeks and Romans, hospitality was a divine condition
 mejabaan se atithiyon kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karnaa sunishchit karne kii apeksha kii jaati thi
 The ancient Greek word xenia, or Theozinia, refers to the ritualistic guest-friendship relationship when the deity is included
 pracheen vishwa main aatithy ke mahatv kaa ek udhaaharan bousis tathaa philmone kii kahani he
 In this story, the ancient gods Zeus and Harmis go to the town of Phrygia disguised as an ordinary farmer
 khaane tathaa raat main rukne kii khoj main unhone kai band daravaaje dekhe, jab tak ki ve philmone tathaa bousis ke ghar main nahin aaye
 yadhyapi vah garib the, parantu dampatti ne achche mejabaan kii tarah vyavhaar karte hue, atithi ko unke paas jo kuch thodaa bahut tha vah diya, tathaa jab vah yah samaj pate hai ki unke atithi vastav main bhesh badal kar aaye devtaa he, ve apane ghar kii raksha karne vaale ek kalahans ko bali karne kaa prastaav karte hai
 In addition to saving the couple in place of the remaining non-hospitable urban people from the city floods, the gods promise to fulfill one of their wishes as a reward
 keltic socytiyon ne bhi aatithy kii dharna kaa sammaan kiya he, visheshkar bachaav ke sambandh main
 ek mejabaan, jisane ek vyakti ko sharan dene kii sweekruti di he, usase apane atithi ko keval bhojan tathaa aashray dene kii hi apeksha nahin kii jaati parantu use yah bhi sunishchit karnaa hota he ki unki dekhbhaal ke adheen mehmaan ko koi haani na ho
 a real-life example of this is originally in the history of the early 17th century Scottish clan macgregor
 clen lemant kaa mukhiya glenstra main mike grager mukhiya ke ghar main aayaa tathaa usne use bataaya ki vah shatruon se bachataa gum rahaa he tathaa sharan dene kii prarthana kii
 mike grager ne apane mukhiya bhai kaa swaagat kiya tathaa koi prashn nahin kiya
 Later that night, members of macgregor Klein came to see the head of the Lamont, and they informed the chief that Lemont had in fact killed his son and heir in a quarrel
 aatithy ke dharmik niyam ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, mike grager ne lemont ko na keval unke gotra ke vyaktiyon ko saunpane se manaa kiya balki agali subah use uski purvajon kii jameen tak choda
 is krity kii baad main pratipurti hui jab mek gregors bhagode ghoshit kiye gayi, lemont ne unke kai logon ko surakshit sthaan diya
 India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world, and each culture has its own favorite stories, some of which are also on hospitality
 jaise ki koi anaadi apana chota sa tukdaa bin bulaae mehmaan ke saath baantta he, is khoj main ki mehmaan bhesh badal kar aaye devtaa ho sakate hai, jo uski udaartaa kaa prachur maatra main puraskaar denge
 jaise ki ek stri, jitna sambhav ho, prempurvak utani khichdi pakaati he, un sabhi ke liye jo bhukhe he, us din tak jab vah khaane kaa apana hissaa bhi aakhri bhukhe vyakti ko de detii he, tathaa bhesh badal kar aaye hue devtaa use kabhi na samaapt hone vaala khichdi kaa bartan puraskaar main dete hai
 Most adult Indians grew up listening to such stories from their childhood
 ve "atithi devo bhav" ke darshan shaastra main vishwaas rakhte hai, jiskaa arth he "atithi bhagwaan hota he"
 is mul mantra se ghar main aaye atithiyon ke sambandh main dayalutaa kaa bhartiya drushtikon tathaa anya sabhi saamaajik paristhitiyaan pramanit hoti hai
 India does not mean modern India, India and Pakistan were the same country before partition in 1947
 isaliye jab bhartiya sabhyataa kii baat kii jaati he, iskaa aashya bharat tathaa pakistan donon ke sambandh main he
 Hospitality as a cultural value or value is an established sociological situation about which people study and write
 Some areas have been molded into the same tradition ek vishesh prakaar ke aatithy kaa pradarshan karte huye kuch kshetra ek hi parampara main dhal gayi hai
 for example: "aatithy aachaar shaastra" shabd kaa prayog do bhinn, parantu sambandhit, adhyayan kshetron ke liye kiya jaataa he: Ethics goes beyond "what has been done" to tell what should be done; Hospitality Ethics explains "what should be done" in matters related to hospitality
 aatithy siddhant evam maanak vibhinn samskritiyon evam paramparaon main; evam puure itihaas main aatithy prachalanon, prakriyaaon evam sambandhon ke jatil vishleshan se liye gayi hai
 Finally, hospitality principles have been applied to commercial and non-commercial arrangements
 achaaran ke ek maanak ke rup main, sampurna itihaas main aatithy ko ek kanoon, ek aachaar shaastra, ek siddhant, ek code, ek karttavya, ek gun ityadi ke rup main mana gaya he
 These advisories were created to deal with uncertain relationships between guests, hosts, citizens and the unfamiliar
 apane pracheen udbhav evam maanav samskritiyon main sarvavyaapaktaa ke baavjood, aatithy ke siddhant par naitik darshanikon ne tulanaatmak rup se kam dhyaan diya he, tathaa unhone apana dhyaan anya naitik siddhanton yatha - acha, bura, sahi evam galat aadi par kendrit kiya
 Until now, hospitality as a moral order, or classical approach to ethics, has outstripped many other consultations for classical behavior: Ethics was a code of hospitality in ancient Middle Eastern, Greek, and Roman cultures that entailed a certain kind of interaction with guests and hosts
 Used to demand conduct
 ek udhaahranh shoorveerta main stesan ke vyaktiyon dwaara anya vyaktiyon ke maange jane par bhojan evam awaas pradaan karnaa aavashyak he
 In many forms, these standards of behavior have existed up to the present day in the commercial hospitality industry, where descendants of ancient ideas continue to inform current standards and practices
 vanijyik aatithy vyavasthaaon main aachaar shaastra
 anuprayukt aachaar shaastra, aachaar shaastra kii vah shakha he jo hamaare aachaar shastreey siddhanton evam nirnyon kii padtaal karti he
 There are many branches of applied ethics: business ethics, professional ethics, medical ethics, academic ethics, environmental ethics and others
 aatithy aachaar shaastra anuprayukt aachaar shaastra kii ek shakha he
 In practice, it combines relationships with other branches of applied ethics, such as business ethics, environmental ethics, business ethics, and others
 For example, when a local hospitality industry progresses, possible ethical dilemmas abound: what are the effects of industry practices on the environment? What is the impact on the host community? What is the impact on the local economy? Local Community; What is the effect on the attitude of citizens regarding outsiders, tourists and guests? These are some of the questions that hospitality ethics can ask as a version of applied ethics
 chunki aatithy evam paryaton sammilit rup se vishwa main sabase bade seva udyogon kaa srijan karata he, atah aatithy evam paryaton se jude vyaktiyon ke liye achche or bure vyavhaar tathaa sahi or galat kaaryon kii bahut sambhaavnaayen hai
 The ethics in these industries is guided by codes of conduct, employee manuals, industry standards and many more
 yadhyapi vishwa paryaton sanghathan ne aachaar shaastra ke udyog anusaar code prastaavit kiye hai, aatithy udyog ke liye vartmaan main koi vaishvik samhita nahin he
 Various text books related to ethics in commercial hospitality systems have been published recently and are currently being used in hospitality education courses

 a dispute has been going on between India and Pakistan since the Partition for the right over the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 1947 main bharat-pakistan ke bich pratham yuddh bhi kashmir ke liye hi hua tha

 Since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, there were many issues going on between India and Pakistan, although the issue of Jammu and Kashmir was the biggest in it, but there were other border disputes, the most prominent of which was the Rann of Kutch, which was a It was a barren area, was on the partition of 20 march 1965 main pakistan ke dwaara jaanboojh kar kuccha ke ran main jhadpen shuru kar di gayi
 Initially they included only the Border Security Force, but later the army of both the countries also joined the war
 On 1 June 1965, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson stopped the fight between the two sides by a fair arbitral court to resolve the dispute
 Established is nyaayalay ne kuccha ke ran kii kareeb 900 varg kilometre jagah pakistan ko de di
 However, Pakistan claimed 3500 square kilometers
 
 Encouraged by the success of the Kutch run, Pakistani politicians, especially the then Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, pressured the President and the Chief of Army Staff General Ayub Khan to order an attack on Kashmir
 bharat us samay china se yuddh haar chukaa tha or unka maananaa tha ki bharat us samay yuddh karne kii sthiti main nahin tha
 Apart from this, Bhutto and other generals agreeing with his view, Yahya Khan and Tikka Khan also believed that the people of Kashmir were willing to merge with Pakistan by liberating from India and would revolt in support of them when the soldiers were disguised as infiltrators
 aakhir general ayub khan dabaav main aa gayi or unhone gupt sainik abhiyaan oparation jibraltar kaa aadesh de diya
 The main objective of this campaign was to incite rebellion among the people of Kashmir and damage the Indian communication system and transport system
 pakistan ke ghuspaithiyon ko jaldi hi pahchaan liya gaya or vidroh karne ke bajaay janata ne unki soochna bhartiya sainikon ko de di or yah abhiyaan purnatah vifal ho gaya

 The purpose of this campaign was to break the Kashmir Valley's connectivity with the rest of India so that its logistics and communication system was disrupted
 pakistan ke is akraman ke liye bharat taiyaar nahin tha or pakistan ko baari sankhya main sainiko or behatar kism ke tanko kaa laabh mil rahaa tha
 In the beginning, India had to face heavy damage, on which the Indian Army used an aerial attack, in response, Pakistan attacked the air base of Punjab and Srinagar
 yuddh ke is charan main pakistan atyadhik behatar sthiti main tha or is apratyaashit hamale se bhartiya kheme main ghabrahat fail gayi thi
 The passing of Akhnoor into the hands of the Pakistani Army could have posed a threat to the Kashmir Valley of India

 Despite the delay of a day, the army chief of the Western Command of India knew that Pakistan was in a very good position and to stop it, he gave a proposal to the then Chief of Army Staff General Chaudhary to open a new front in the Punjab border and attack Lahore
 Be given

 On the same day, the Pakistan Army, with the help of armored unit and air force, made a large counter attack on the 15th section of the Indian Army, although it caused only minor damage to the 3 Jats but the 15th segment had to retreat and its logistics and weapons vehicles were severely damaged

 Encouraged by this, Pakistan's army attacked the Indians and entered further into the Indian border
 apane antim aakraamak ke liye pakistan apane pehla bakhtarband divijan or 11vaan infantry divijan ke saath amritsar par kabje ke iraade se khemkaran par hamalaa kar diya
 According to him, after Amritsar, according to the statement from Jalandhar and then President Ayub Khan, Delhi would be the next target

 And here, between them, the second largest tank battle was fought after World War, in which Pakistan suffered a tremendous defeat
 usne apane 97 tanks kho diye, jisamen 72 paton tanks shaamil the; iske alaava 32 tanks chalati haalat main kabja kar liya gaya
 Where before, the advancing Pakistani army lost in the war of the real north, the balance of war was tilted in favor of India
 iske baad yah jagah america main bane paton naam ke pakistani tanko ke upar paton nagar ke naam se janaa jane laga
 After this battle, Pakistan's first armored division was sent back to Sialkot where it did not participate further in the war

 In the battle 3000 Indian Army and 3800 Pakistani Army soldiers were martyred

 The Indian state had fertile areas of Sialkot, Lahore and Kashmir, while Pakistan occupied the barren areas of Sindh and Chamba
 is yuddh main aazaadee ke baad pehali baar bhartiya vaayu sena evam pakistani vaayu sena ke vimaanon ne ek dusre kaa muqabla kiya
 Earlier, both of these air forces participated in the First Kashmir War in the 1940s, in which their contribution was much less and limited to transportation as compared to 1965 war
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke paas badi sankhya main hoker hunter, bharat main nirmit folland nait, de havilland vempaire, i i canberra bamavarshak or mig-21 kii ek squadran thi
 The Pakistani Air Force's fadter planes were 102 F-86F sabers and 12 F-104 starfighters, and 24 B-57 Canberra bombers
 sangharsh ke dauraan bharat or pakistan vaayu senaaon kaa anupaat 5:1 tha
 However, the two air forces were similar in the war, as most of the Indian Air Force was stationed east to avoid the possibility of China entering the war
 pakistani vimaan zyaadaatar america the, jabaki bharat ke paas soviet va europea vimaanon kaa mila jula bedaa tha
 It was widely circulated that Pakistan's American aircraft are better than Indian aircraft, but according to some experts this was not correct as the Indian Air Force's mig-21, Hawker Hunter and Folland Nate fighter's performance from their rival Pakistan's F-86 Saber Was better
 yuddh main pakistan kii nan0 19 squadran kaa netritv karne vaale air commander sajaad haidar ke anusaar- haalaanki bhartiya vayusena ke vempaire fiter vimaan F-86 saibar ke mukaable puraane or kamazor the, lekin hunter vimaan shakti evam gati donon main hi unase behatar the
 According to Indians, the F-86 was weak in front of the small Folland Nate, causing these aircraft to be called "saber destroyers"
 pakistan vayusena kaa F-104 starfiter upmahadweep main us samay kaa sabase tej gati kaa fiter vimaan tha or use praayah "pakistan vayusena kaa garv" kaha jaataa tha
 But according to Sajjad Haider, those aircraft did not deserve this honor because they were made with the "purpose of stopping and combating Soviet bombers flying at an altitude of more than 40,000 feet", not with low-speed fighter aircraft
 To fight
 atah ye us samay ke maahaul ke upyukt nahin the
 "the Indian Air Force was worried because of Starfighter, but they did not prove to be as effective in combat as the slower but more agile, Folland Nat Fighter
 phir bhi saibar or nats ke bich chale dwand yuddh main supersonic gati ke saath, saibar kahi zyada safal rahaa
 Both countries have made contrary claims to each other about the losses incurred in the fighting and few neutral sources have verified them
 pakistani vayusena kaa daawa tha ki usne bharat ke 104 vimaan giraae or apane 19 vimaan khoe, jabaki bhartiya vayusena ne daawa kiya ki unhone pakistan ke 73 vimaan giraae or apane 35 vimaan khoe
 According to a neutral source, the Pakistani Air Force flew 86 F-86 Sabers, 10 F-104 Starfighters, and 20 B-57 Canberra aircraft in a parade held shortly after the end of the war, claiming that the Indian Air Force had dropped 73 Pakistani aircraft
 It seems to be wrong, which was almost the entire first line of fighter jets of Pakistan at that time
 pakistan vayusena ke keval ek squadran ko khone ke daavon ko, bhartiya sutron ne nakaarte hue bataaya he ki, pakistan ne shuruuaati yuddh ke 10 dinon ke bheetar hi indonesia, iraq, iran, turki or china se atirikt vimaan hasil karne kii maang kii thi
 According to independent sources, the PAF had lost some 20 aircraft while the Indians had lost 60–75 aircraft
 pakistan ne yuddh kii samaapti tak apni 17 pratishat agrim pankti kii takat kho di, jabaki bharat kaa nuksaan 10 pratishat se bhi kam tha
 In addition, it is estimated that if the conflict had continued for three weeks, the Pakistani losses would have increased by 33 percent and India's losses would have been 15 percent
 1965 ke yuddh main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad tinkon ke sabase bade yuddh lade gaye
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armor was largely American-made; It consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; Some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, India fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armoured cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armoured divisions, the 1st and 6th Armoured divisions – the latter being in the process of formation
