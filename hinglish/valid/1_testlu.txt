 The study of geomorphic changes is also often called dynamic geology
 spasht he ki yah naam prishthiya vaataavaran kii gatisheel sthiti kii ore sanket karata hai, kintu aajkal yah naam kuch vishesh prachlit nahin hen or iske sthaan par bhautik bhuvigyaan adhik prachlit he
 There are three main parts of this science, which are as follows: prakritik karkon dwaara prishthiya shailon kaa kshay, apradan evam anaachhadan tathaa usase utpann avsaad ityadi kaa parivahan, Accumulation of depression and sanchit avsaad kaa sangyojan or drudhibhavan The natural factors that affect the surface matter can be divided into two classes according to the condition of their playground: dharatleey or Visceral inamen dharatleey karkon kii kriyaatmak urja pradhanthya evam charmat: surya se utpann hoti hai
 In this category, various components of the atmosphere, rain etc
, visceral waters and fountain, river and glaciers, sea and lake are particularly notable
 inkaa kreedakshetra mukhyat: bhumandal kaa thal bhaag hota hai, jisamen samudri tat bhi sammilit honge
 They do not have any effect on the surface of the ocean and their penetration is relatively subtle even in the deepest parts of the surface
 aantbhom karkon kii urja kaa pradhan strot prithvi kii aantarik ushnata hi he
 In this category, planing, volcanic play, heat and earthquake etc
 occur
 spasht he ki inkaa mul kreedakshetra dharaatal ke neeche he or unase utpann prabhaav dharaatal ke upar kabhi aa jate hai or kabhi nahin aa pate
 There are four main components in the atmosphere which are working towards the earth: rain, heat change, frost and wind
 varsha ek bahut saamaanya, kintu atyant shaktimaan kaarak he
 Its method of work is somewhat chemical and some forced
 purnataya shuddh jal main rasinic kriya karne kii kshamta praaia: bilkul nahin hoti
 Although most of the rainwater is pure before reaching the earth, both atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide merge in it when coming from the sky
 oxykrut or carbonikrut varshajal kii abhikriya se prishthiya shailon ke anekanek khanij apni apni prakruti ke anusaar oxidon or carboneton main parivartit ho jate hai
 Some minerals, or many molecules, also form chemical compounds hydrate with water
 is prakaar varshaalay kii rasinic kriya dwaara shilaayein apaghatit ho jaati hai
 Newly formed substances have some solutes and some insoluble
 viley ansh banane ke saath hi jal main villin hokar bah jate hai or aviley ansh jahaan ke tahaan chhot jate hai
 The indestructible portion consists of clay molecules and sand, which accumulate over time to form different levels of soil
 kabhi kabhi aviley padaarth ko sanchit hone kaa avasar hi nahin mil paata, apitu varsha kaa jal dharaatal par behate hue use bhi purnataya athwa anshat:, apane saath bahaakar le jaataa he
 As long as the water has the power to drain the substance, it goes on flowing and when the power is depleted it sits where it is
 is prakaar varsha ke jal dwaara bahaae hue padaarth ko kehete hai
 Its volume depends on the slope of the surface and the speed of rainfall
 dhaal kii pravanta or varsha kii tivrata donon hi varsha ke jal ke bahaane kii shakti ko varddhit karti hai
 Local climate also has a great effect on the results of rainfall, if the amount of annual rainfall in the two regions is often the same, but one has light splashes and the other has occasional but very intense rainfall, So the effect of rainfall will be different in these two regions
 isi prakaar sookhe or barsaati mausamon ke ekantaranwale pradeshon main bhi varsha kaa prabhaav ekadam bhinn ho jaataa he
 Variation of heat also has an effect on the activation of rainfall
 ushnatapradhan deshon main varsha ke jal main apghaton karne kii shakti, sheetapradhan deshon kii apeksha, kahin adhik hoti hai
 Due to alternating heat and cold, the rocks are broken apart, turning into thick or fine powder
 dravya kaa yah saadhaaran gun he ki garmi ke prabhaav se failata he or sardi paane par sikudta he
 The amount of expansion and contraction depends on the material, that is, some fluid expands more and some less
 bahut si shilaayein do, teen yaa or adhik khanijon kii bani hoti hai
 Therefore, in the heat of the day, all these minerals are spread according to their own properties and in the night it gets frosty and shrinks
 kaai khanij kam failata he, kaai adhik
 The mineral that spreads more puts a type of pressure on others, causing the particles to break apart
 din prati din is prakram ke chalate rahane se prabhaav badhata jaataa he or kalantar main shailon kii upree paraten churnapraia ho jaati he
 It is obvious that the greater the difference in temperature between day and night, the greater the velocity the rocks will be separated
 is kriyaamein khanijon ke rasinic sanghatan main praaia: bilkul hi parivartan nahin hota, keval khanijon ke parsparik bandhan itane deele pad jate hai ki ve ek duusare se pruthak ho jate hai
 That is why this action is called dissolution
 varsha or taapaparivartan donon kii sammilit kriya se, jo bahudhaa prakruti main hoti he, Both the decomposition and disintegration of rocks are encouraged
 tushaar kii kriya bhi keval balkrit hi hoti he
 The source of the power of this factor is the common circle that at 4 ° c the relative density of water is maximum
 isse or adhik thandha hone par ghanatv kam hone lagata he, arthath duusare shabdon main yah kahana chahie ki jal ke aaytan main vruddhi ho jaati he
 When the water is converted into ice at 0 ° C, then its volume often increases to tenth hour
 at: kritrim vidhi se barf jamaane main is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana nitant aavashyak hota he ki barf ke bade hue aaytan ke liye paatr main rikt sthaan hona chahie
 In the absence of this space, the pressure of the spreading ice is expected to cause the character to burst
 isi vrut ke anusaar sheetapradhan deshon main jab shilaayein tushaar ke prabhaav main aati hai, to unke ang ang chhin bhinn ho jate hai
 Water penetrates into the pores and walls of the rocks and freezes every day when it gets cold and melts when it gets hot
 isse kuch hi kaal main chattaanon kii upree paraton ke avyav kamjor or praaia: asambaddha ho jate hai
 Later, due to the shock of rain and wind, they spontaneously crumble
 bahudhaa tushaar kaa yah prabhaav visphoti hota he
 In those parts of the winter months where the vegetation is less, open, uncultivated rocks are thus covered with broken rock blocks and large amounts of such blocks are collected in the hills of the hills, known as Shailamalba
 in khandon kaa koi nishchit aakaar nahin hota or inke kone bahudhaa nukile evam paine hote hai
 Tusshar is a very powerful factor for rock disintegration, but its area of work is only cold
 vaayu ke vishisht kreedakshetra registan or unche parvaty pradesh hai, jahaan yah bahudhaa teevr gati se bahati he
 It has the unique ability to perform forced erosion under favorable conditions
 isaki shakti kaa mukhya rahasy is baat main he ki yah anginati chote bade baaluu or mitti ke kanon ko badi teevr gati se uda le jaati he
 These particles repeatedly collide with each other while flowing in the raging wind, causing abrasion and gradually becoming smaller
 saath hi jhanjhaavat ke maarg main jo pahaad, chattaane evam pathar ke khand aa jate hai, un sabake upar bhi ye baaluu jhonka kii bhanti aghat karte hai, jisase ve sabhi apgharshit hote rahete hai
 Generally, sand is not able to rise to much higher than the ground level
 is kaaran vaayu kii apradan-kriya-kshetra kii oonchaai bhi usee anupaat se simit rah jaati he
 As a result, in the desert regions often the lower parts of the hills and rocks become thin and narrow, but the upper body is left unaffected
 is prakaar ke adhoradan se kukuramutta aadi saddash kuch vilakshan akritiyaan ban jaati hai
 In the desert regions, the direction of wind is usually the same for a long time, due to which the direction of their abrasion and erosion is also unchanged for a long time
 is kaaran registaanon main vayutpann golashm gol matol na hokar, koniya or falkeey hote hai
 In fact, for them, the word 'gholam' is inappropriate and should be used in place of the German word decanter
 vaayu main apradan ke saath saath parivahan kii bhi vilakshan shakti he
 Fine sand and dust particles are carried by the vast quantities of air from the desert regions every year and deposit in places where their velocity decreases and the grass and shrubs obstruct its path
 is prakaar se pariwahit padaarth ke nikshepon ko vaiudh baaluu or vaiudh mrittika kehete hai
 In northern China, there is a large deposition of this type of eolian clay, which is 300 to 450 meters in thickness, and which the wind has brought here from the deserts of Central Asia
 varsha dwaara laae hue jal kaa kuch bhaag vashpikaran se pun: vayumandal main chalaa jaataa he, kuch dharaatal par bahata hua nadiyon ke maarg se samudr main pahunch jaataa he or kuch prithvi main ant:sravit ho jaataa he
 The part which flows on the ground is called runoff and the surface which is endowed, is called underground or visceral water
 in teenon bhaagon kaa parsparik anupaat sthaneey jalwaayu, sthalakriti or bhoumiki par nirbhar rahata he
 The amount of evaporation prevails in regions of humid climate
 samaan jalwaayu ke pradeshon me sthalakriti kii vishmata ke saath apwaahit jal kii maatra adhik hoti jaati he
 The circle of geology is also very important, because some rocks are very fringed, but their penetration is very small, such as rock and clay
 inke atirikt ek teesri shrenee kii shilaayein na to randhri hoti or na praveshya, jese granite
 Thus, the amount of water that is injected depends on the physical characteristics of the local rocks
 dharaatal main kuch gaharaai par pahunchne par, bhoomi or shail jal se santrupt ho jate hai
 The surface of saturation is called the ground level
 is str kii gaharaai kshetravishesh kii vaaðshak varsha kii maatra, sthalakriti or sthaneey bhoumikeey sanrachana par nirbhar hoti hai
 Generally, the soil is closer to the ground in wet areas than in dry areas
 samudr, jhil, sarovar evam badi nadiyon ke samipsth bhaagon main bhi yah str apekshaakrit dharaatal ke sameep hota he
 It goes deep due to drought and comes up when there is excess rain
 aantbhaum jal prishth main kitni gaharaai tak samaa saktaa he, yah baat bhi sthaneey shailon kii sanrachana par nirbhar he
 Water enters the foliage sites and estuaries between the rocks, so the depth to which the rocks contain foramen, or fissures, is as far as collapsing in most of the fissure due to the pressure of the underground rocks
 randhravkash bhi alp ho ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the visceral water does not go to the depths and starts moving towards the earth
 antat: iskaa lakshya samudr he
 Sometimes it reaches there by underground routes and sometimes it gets such routes, from which it again reaches the ground as springs
 khule hue tathaa chaude vidaron or sandhitalon ke atirikt, anyatra aantbhaum jal kii pravaahgati saadhanya ati mand hoti he
 This is why it does not have the power to perform any type of forced action, but it can do chemical action in favorable conditions
 vidar or sandhitalon ke anuprastha aage badhate hue yah, varshajal kii hi bhanti, deevaaron ke shailon ke khanijon ko oxikrut, carbonikrut, athwa jalyojit kar detaa he or is prakaar shail kaa apghaton ho jaataa he
 In the terrain where limestone rocks are present, there is a large area of working underground water
 carbonikrut jal main chuunaapatthar villin ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the water flowing from the limestone's seventies merges many parts of it into caves
 kabhi kabhi is prakar bani gufaaon kaa aakaar bada, kai sau meter tak lanbaa or 4-5 meter gaharaa ho jaataa he or inamen se bahata hua jal aantbhaum nadi bana detaa he
 Somewhere carbonated water starts dripping from the roof of the cave
 tapakate pani kii kuch bhaag vashpikrut hokar ud jaataa he or usamen viley calcium carbonate tapakanevaale sthaan par avakshepit ho jaataa he
 Frequent dripping of droplets at the same place and continuous precipitation of calcium carbonate at the same place creates a columnar amount, called stalactite
 isi prakaar kii kriya gupha ke farsh par tapake hue jal ke vashpkaran se bhi hoti he or usase bhi avakshepit carbonate se aisi stambhakar akruti banati he jo farsh se chat kii ore badhati he
 These shapes are called stalagmites
 kabhi kabhi stalegmite ek duusare kii ore badhate hue milakar gupha kii chat se farsh tak kaa satat stambh bana dete hai
 Sometimes there is no specific form of precipitated carbonate amount
 aisi avasthaa main use calk nisaad, tupha yaa travertine kehete hai
 In some caves, the amount of carbonate precipitated in this way becomes so large that such carbonate can carry on business
 upar yah ullekh kiya gaya he ki kabhi kabhi aantbhaum jal soton ke rup main pun: dharaatal par laut aata he
 This phenomenon depends on the specific configuration of local rocks
 yadi koi baluupathar kaa randhri shail, r, is prakaar vinyast ho ki uske upar or neeche purnataya athwa praaia: apargamya shail, mrittika, shell yaa anya koi usee gun kii shilaayein sthit hon, to aantbhaim jal randhri shail main risataa hua, apargamya shila ke upree sansparsh tal tak pahunchne ke baad, staron kii dhaal ke anusaar pashrvavarti disha main badhane lagegaa
 In the same direction, wherever that rock is uncovered in a natural cut, the water will start flowing in the form of springs
 bahudhaa shailon main upasthit bhranshatal bhi soton ke banane main sahaayta dete hai
 If due to a fault, the impermeable rock is displaced and located in the proximity of the stomata and permeable rock, then at the place where the erosion will be transverse to the natural cut, there will be springs falling
 soton ke pani main praaia: sadaiv khanij padaarth thodi bahut maatra main villin hote hai
 When their quantity is more than 1 per cent by weight, then it is called mineral spring
 par sarsaadhaaran vyavhaar main kisi bhi aise sote ko, jiske pani main villin khanij padaarth ke kaaran kuch vishisht swaad ho, khanij sota kehete hai
 But in normal practice, any spring, which has some specific taste due to the mineral content dissolved in the water, is called mineral spring; However, minerals like calcium carbonate are very abundant and do not give any flavor and magnesium salts start tasting even in very small amounts
 soton kaa pani bahudhaa dabaav ke adheen hota he
 There is a decrease in pressure as the water comes out and the solubility of water also decreases with it
 at: soton ke udgam sthaan par bahudhaa khanij padaarth avakshepit ho jaataa he
 The composition of this substance is usually powdery or silicic and, according to the depositional composition, is called calc nisad, or silicic acid
 kabhi kabhi louh carbonate, athwa anya lavan, yaa gandhak bhi avakshepit ho jate hai
 The water of any spring is very hot and sometimes the water is also radioactive
 bihar rajya main rajgir ke garam pani ke sote bahut prasiddh hai
 The water of these springs often comes from very deep parts of the surface
 kuch soton kaa pani aantbhaum na hokar megmiy utpatti kaa bhi hota he, arthath aisa jal jo sudur garbh main megmiy padaarth se nikle hue vaashp se yukt hota he
 Such fountain is called magmatic fountain
 kahin kahin aantbhaum jal aisi vishisht paristhiti main vidyaman hota he ki us sthaan par kuan banane se pani swat: upar chadh aata he or kahin kahin to pani kii dhar fauware kii bhanti dharaatal se kai meter tak upar uchhalati hui nikalati he
 These are called excretory follicles
 inke banane ke liye anivaary praveshya pratibandh ye hai: aantbhaum jal ek aise randhramay or apraveshya shail ke andar sanchit ho jiske upar or neeche donon ore apargamya shail avasthit hon, staron ke pravan kii disha main jal ke bahakar nikal jane kaa maarg avaruddha ho or jal kaa mul strothasthaan, kuna banane ke sthaan se itani oonchaai par ho ki vaanchhneeya taral sthitik daab utpann ho, jiske prabhaav se kuan banane par jal swat: dharaatal tak upar uth jaay
 a very remarkable condition has been found at the Neyveli site in the South Arcot district of Madras province, where huge peat deposits have been found
 vahaan utsrut jal kii daab or maatra donon hi itani adhik hai ki peet ke utkhanan main bahut kathinaayee hui he, tathaa jal ko niyantrit karne ke liye vishesh saadhan prayukt karne pade hai
 The river is very effective and functional among natural factors
 yah apradan, parivahan or nickshepan, teenon hi prakaar ke kaary atyadhik pariman main karti he
 Although the importance of the work of rainwater is of little importance, its effect and fruit appear to be more pronounced as the action of the river is concentrated in long and relatively narrow valleys
 varshajal kii bhanti hi nadi kaa jal bhi apni ghati ke tal or kinaaron ke shailon ko rasinic kriya dwaara apaghatit kar saktaa he
 The solute fraction of the decomposed material thus dissolved in the river water and the insoluble portion also flows along the ravine
 yah kriya nadi apane parvatiy pradesh ke maarg main sugamawa se karti he, kyonki vahaan ghaar itani vegvan hoti he ki praaia: sadaiv nae, anpadhtit shailon kii staren anaachhadit hoti rahati hai jisase ki ve sahaj hi kriya ke prabhaav main aati rahati hai
 But when the velocity of the torrent in the plains decreases, the valley floor is covered with soil and sand cover
 falat: anpadhtit shailon se sampark bhi kam ho jaataa he
 In areas where limestone rocks are high, chemical activity is very abundant in those areas, because in carbonated water, limestone dissolves spontaneously
 rasinic kii apeksh balkrit apradan karne kii shakti nadi main bahut adhik hoti he
 Generally pure water cannot degrade the rocks, but when sand and gravel are mixed in it, the situation changes, as they both support each other
 nadi kaa kaa jal shakti pradaan karata he or baaluu evam bajri apgharshan karte hai, jiske prabhaav se tah or kinare shanai: shanai: chote hote jate hai
 In addition, they themselves take part in desilting the rocks of the fold
 nadi kii apgharshan shakti ghaar kii tivrata par nirbhar he or dhar kii tivrata sthalakriti par aadhaarit he
 The more prone the gradient is, the sharper is also sharper accordingly
 saath hi jal kii maatra bhi dhar kii gati ko prabhavit karti he
 The speed of the blade increases with the ratio of its speed to its cube root, that is, if the volume of water becomes eightfold, the speed of the edge becomes double
 falat:, jin deshon main sookhe or barsaati mausam pruthak pruthak hote hai, vahaan nadiyon kii apradan shakti barsaat ke dinon main bahut bad jaati he
 Initially, the banks of the river are usually steep and rich, especially in hard rock areas
 kintu vayumandaleey karkon ke prabhaavavash, kinaaron ke upree bhaag shanai: shanai: apkshin hone lagate hai
 The decomposed and fragmented material produced by it carries the river
 iske falswaroop kalantar main nadi kii ghati kaa pariched j aakaar kaa ho jaataa he arthath uske donon kinare tal kii ore dhaalu ho jate hai
 The river flows from a high place to the sea, so its effort is always to cut the ground and lower it so that it becomes equal to the sea level
 is tarah nadi ke sheersh se sangam tak ke anudaidhry pariched kii pravanta sheersh kii ore sabase adhik or sangam ke sameep sabase kam hoti he
 In other words, the vertical erosion of the river is highest in the upper reaches of the valley and decreases as it moves towards the sea
 jab nadiyon kii ghati aisi sthit main pahunch jaati ki udhrvadhar kataav ek dam band ho jaay or uski ghati kaa tal samudratal ke samaan ho jaay, to vah apradan ke charam str par pahunch jaati he
 The valley in which the vertical erosion is intensely progressive is called Tarun, which has reached the peak, it is called old and its inner state is mature
 ek hi ghati ke vibhinn bhaagon main teenon avasthaaen vidyaman ho sakati hai
 If topographical changes occur in the area of an old Sarita valley due to the influence of prudential forces and the site reverberates, the river becomes rejuvenated and once again starts vertical harvesting
 saadharantaya nadi kii ghati kii pravanta kramik haati he, yadhyapi pravanta kii maatra sthaan sthaan par ghat bad sakati he
 But sometimes the diathesis also becomes obsolete and waterfalls are formed
 yah sthiti visheshkar aise pradeshon main hoti jahaan kathor or mridu shilaon kaa ekantaran hota he
 Soft water flows away easily and easily, due to which there is a large amount of engraving in the valley
 kathor str avarodhi he or jahaan kaa tahaan khadaa rah jaataa he
 The water flowing over it starts falling into the more carved part of the soft level of the valley
 is prakaar ghati kii pravanta akramik ho jaati he or jal prapaat ban jate hai
 Often, the location of these falls also gradually diverges towards the top of the river
 hota yah he ki prapaat ke sthaan par pani ke oonchaai se girane ke kaaran nadi kii dhar main teji aa jaati he, jisase uski apradan shakti or bad jaati he
 Just below the waterfall, a kind of dahl is formed, in which whirlpools begin to fall and the rapidly moving water in them starts cutting the wall of the waterfall
 is prakaar nichevala mridu str or bhi teji se katataa jaataa he or ek prakaar kaa talochhedan hone lagata hai, jisase kathor str niravlamb hokar baahar ko nikal aata he
 Over the course of the uptake, the most forward part of the stern falls apart and falls in the absence of longitudinally, and the position of the falls retracts equal to the size of the fallen shell
 yah kriya barambar hoti rahati he or prati baar prapaat kaa sthaan kramash: peeche hat jaataa he
 Due to this type of erosion, due to the breaking of hard rock, a deep blast is formed from the initial place of the fall backwards
 jabalpur ke sip narmada nadi kii sangmarmar ke shailon main utkeern ghati or bhedaghat kaa jalprapaat is ghatana kaa sundar ddashtaant he
 The fall of the world-famous Nyagara River is made in this way
 vahaan kii gai maapon se maaloom hota he ki prapaat prati varsh apane sthaan se praaia: dedh meter peeche hat jaataa he
 It is estimated that at the same speed, it will usually take 20 to 35 thousand years to build the 11 km long valley of Nyagara
 or bhi kai paristhitiyon main jalprapaat ban sakate hai, kintu mulat: har avasthaa main ghati ke vibhinn avyavon ke apradan kii gati main antar hona aavashyak he
 These falls are salient to the young state of the valley
 apradan kii charam str avasthaa main pahunchne par nadi kii shakti apane pashrvo ko kaatane main lag jaati he
 When the valley is very straight, the two sides are cut by one, but inequality arises due to slight curvature
 ghati ke avatal pashrv kii ore dhar main adhik tivrata hoti he or isaliye udhar kataav adhik maatra main hota he
 Therefore by decreasing the velocity of the torrent towards the opposite convex side, not only the erosion stops but the asymmetry is further increased by the river and the path of the river becomes more and more curved
 is prakaar visarpi mode kii utpatti hoti he
 Often the dimensions of these turns are greatly increased and the turns also become very complex
 kabhi kabhi do mode ek dusre ke itane paas aa jate he ki unke bich kii ekadam sidhi duuri, nadi ke anuprastha maarg kii duuri kaa dashamansh yaa or bhi kam hoti he
 In such a condition, sometimes the narrow cervix between two turns begins to flow through a straight path, and one or more extracorporeal turns are discarded, which is called spasm
 nadi kaa parivahan kaary, praaia: sabhi prakritik karkon kii apeksha adhik prabhavi hota he
 The rock powder, gravel, sand, and soil produced by private erosion, all of which flows down the river to the sea, along with atmospheric factors, especially the rock powder and block produced by rainwater, in the course of some time By the way, they reach the valley of the river and holding it in the ravine, they all move slowly towards the sea
 jin bade bade khandon ko nadi kii dhar uthaane main asamarth hoti he, ve tah ke anuprastha ludhakate hue chalate hai or chote kan nilambit badhate hue chale jate he
 The power of transport is dependent on the speed of the torrent
 yadi gati main vruddhi kii maatra va ho, to parivahan shakti va6 ho jaayegi
 That is, if the speed doubles, then the transport power will become 64 times
 isse spasht he ki varshaati baadh ke samay nadiyon kii parivahan shakti or saath saath vinaash shakti kii maatra bahut bhayanak ho jaati he
 Residents on the banks of big rivers like Ganga, Brahaputra etc
 are well aware of this destructive power
 nilambit baaluu or mitti ke atirikt anekanek padaarth nadiyaan apane jal main villin kar, mahadeshiy bhaagon se samudr kii ore le jaati hai
 As mentioned in the cases of rainwater and visceral water, their chemical activity is abundant, due to which soluble substances are also formed in the same proportion
 yah sabhi padaarth kalantar main nadiyon main pahunch jate hai
 The rivers themselves produce some soluble material by their action and all of them reach the sea respectively
 gananaa kar yah anumaan kiya gaya he ki ganga or brahamputra apane sammilit maarg se praaia: 1100 n 106 ghan meter mitti or baaluu prati varsh bengal kii khadi main pahunchaa detii he america kii mississippi nadi dwaara prati varsh parivahit padaarth kii maatra 200n106 ghan meter hai
 The Hwanghao River of China carries such a vast amount of soil that the sea near its mouth remains yellow for miles and it is called the Yellow Sea
 dakshini america main amejon nadi dwaara bahaai mitti or baaluu se uske muhane ke saamne samudr ke tal main jo delta saddash bhoomi ban gai hai, vah praaia: 200 kilometre lambii he
 Estimated, the amount of material transported by all the rivers of the world is estimated to be 16 cubic kilometers per year
 jaisaa purvavarti khand main bataaya gaya hai, nadi kii parivahan shakti uski dhar kii gati par nirbhar hoti he
 So as soon as his torrent is in motion, some part of his load starts depositing immediately
 nadi ke maarg main sabase pehla mahatvapurn nickshepan centre pahaad ke tal main us sthaan par hota he jahaan vah parvaty pradesh chhodkar maidan main pravesh karti he
 Very large golashyams and small big buttons, which come rolling smoothly across the valley in the valley, sit at the bottom as they enter the river plain
 is prakaar pahaado ke tal bhaag main ek nikshep ban jaataa he, jise jalopha shanku, athwa pankhaa kehete hai
 Another important speed change is near the confluence of the river
 ek to ghati kii dhaal vahaan pahonchte pahonchte yon hi bahut kam ho jaati he, duusare samudr va jhil kaa pani bhi bahaav ko roktaa he
 Often the velocity of the torrent is reduced so much that the tidal velocity is greater than the velocity of the river, which at the time of the tide, the river's edge starts flowing backward
 iskaa fal yah he ki sangam ke paas ke pradesh main nadi badi tivrata se avsaad or talachat nickshepit karne lagati he or uski apni banaai hui ghati hi bharne lagati hai
 Due to the deposition of depression, the flow of the river becomes more difficult and the river is divided into many small streams
 kalantar main is nickshepit avsaad main ek chauras maidan sa ban jaataa he, jisamen se anek choti dharaayen ati manthar gati se bahati hui samudr kii ore jaati hai
 The plain is triangular, with one vertex at the point in the river valley from where the current begins to divide and the baseline in front of it lies transverse to the coast of the sea
 is prakaar ke pradesh ko delta kehete hai
 Due to the blocking of the motion at the confluence of the river, sand is often deposited in longitudinal zodiac signs, which is called sand blast
 jalodh shanku or delta ke bich ke bhaag main nadi bahudhaa mausami baadh or utaar se prabhavit hoti rahati he
 During the flood, the river gets so much water that it cannot fit in its valley
 falat: vah donon kinaaron ke upar se hota hua kuch dur tak fail jaataa he
 The region that comes under the influence of floods in this way is called flood plain
 us bhaag main nadi kii dhar kii gati mukhya dhar kii apeksha bahut kam ho jaati he, jisase vahaan prachur maatra main mitti or baaluu nickshepit ho jaati he
 In contrast, during flood, the speed of the main stream is much higher than the speed of normal time, so erosion increases there and the river takes away the previously deposited sand and soil
 jaisaa pehle ullekh kiya ja chukaa he, nadi kii cheshtaa apni ghati ko nirantar gaharaa kar, apradan ke charamastar par pahunchaane kii hoti he
 As the depth of the valley increases, it often comes such a situation that even during the floods, it is not possible to reach the floodplain
 aisi dasha main nadi ek nayaa baadh-maidan banaati he
 Puranwala is called the flood-plains river Vedika
 bahudhaa nadi kii ghaatiyon main abhinav tal se kaaphi upar donon kinaaron par, athwa ek hi ore, is prakaar kii vedikaaye dikhaai padati he
 Somewhere, 2-3 or even more Vedicas meet on top of each other on different floors respectively
 unke adhyayan se nadi kii ghati ke vikaas kaa itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 In the higher mountainous regions and cold countries, colder rains bring water instead of water
 jin pradeshon main him-varsha us maatra main adhik ho jitna garmi ke samay main him pighalta he, ve pradesh sadaiv himachhadit rahete hai
 The height at which this happens is called the snow line
 yah oonchaai vibhinn vibhinn akshanshon or pradeshon main vibhinn hoti he, yatha himalay main isaki oonchaai praaia: 4,500 se 5,500 meter tak he, alps parvat 2,400 meter or norge main keval 1,500 meter he
 a large part of the sea is always snowed near the poles, especially at the south pole
 akaash se aate samay him rooyee ke gaalon ke samaan komal hota he
 In fact, there is abundant air in it
 jab ek badi raashi ekatrit ho jaati he, to upree staron kii daab se neeche kii staron main se hawa nikal jaati he or himakan aapas main milakar kathor barf ke rup main parivartit ho jate hai
 Due to the effect of gravity when collected over vast quantities, the amount of snow in the favorable topographic regions gradually slopes downwards and thus becomes a river, called glacier
 kalantar main nadi kii bhanti vah bhi apane liye ek ghati bana leti he
 Which she deepens more and more
 thos barf se utkeern hone ke kaaran himandi kii ghaatiyon ke kuch vishisht lakshan hote hai, jinamein se teen pramukh he: Their nits are wide and flattened, so that their upward passage is six-shaped, unki ghaatiyaan sarpil na hokar bahut dur tak ekadam sidhi chali jaati he or In place of the confluence of the main glacier and the tributary glacier, the bottom of the two valleys is rather gradual
 is kaaran sahaayak nadiyon kii ghati nilambi ghati kehalaati he
 Due to solid, glacial speed is very low
 kahin kahin to dinabhar main keval 30 centimetre hi aage badhati he
 Sometimes the velocity is also relatively high
 alaska main kuch himandiyaan ek din main praaia: dhai teen meter bad jaati he
 This speed, similarly to the speed of the river, depends on the amount of snow and the slope of the regional gradient
 himrekha ke neeche pahunchne par barf pighalane lagati he or saadhaaran nadi kaa rup dhaaran kar leti he
 The melting glaciers are the primary source of water of almost all the rivers coming from the Himalayas
 jin pradeshon main himrekha samudratal main praaia: baraabar hi hoti he, vahaan himandi swayan samudr main gir jaati he
 At such confluences, large amounts of ice often break away from the original river due to the pressure of the snow coming from behind and flow into the sea and flow far enough away
 in raashiyon ko plavi himshail kehete hai
 Plowy icebergs can also be formed for other reasons
 bahut thande pradeshon main kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki samudr ke paas jane par bhi himandi apana rup banaaye rahati he or tat ke sameep kii samudr tah ko bhi uttkeern kar apni ghati kaaphi dur tak aage badhaati chali jaati he
 There are many examples of valleys like this in Norway and Sweden, and they are called fyards
 nadi kii bhanti, himandi bhi chattaanon ko aparadit tathaa unase toote hue khandon kaa parivahan karti he
 But there is a great difference in the method of action of both
 jahaan nadi kii tah main anek chote-bade rode dhar ke veg se ludhakte hue aage badhate hai, himandi main unke ludhakne ke liye koi avasar nahin
 The piece that gets stuck in ice moves in the same state
 yatra tatra chattaanon ke bahut se tukade tuutakar himandi ke upar gir jate hai
 As the snowfall moves forward, these blocks also move forward as they are
 is bhinnata ke falswaroop jahaan nadi dwaara parivahit pathar kuch kaal ludhakte hue tathaa aapas main takaraate hue gol matol batiya swaroop ho jate hai, himdhar dwaara le jaye gayi khand ant tak koniya va nukile hi bane rahete hai
 Apart from this, with the help of the torrent, the river divides its transported material into separate parts on the basis of size and density, such as only thick gravel in places of sharp edge, thick sand in less sharp edge and lower and lower speed respectively
 When fine sand and clay are deposited in the valley folds alternately
 iske vipareet himandi padaarth ko isprakaar chhant nahin sakati, apitu uski lad main bade rode, maheen baaluu or mitti, vibhinn aakaaron ke khand, sab ek saath mili hue aage badhate hai
 And where glaciers begin to melt, all of them deposit together without any division
 himandi main padaarth ke parivahan kii shakti aparimit he
 Large sections of rocks can also carry snow with the same ease so that small particles
 is prakaar jahaan nadi kii ghati main maatr shail se pruthak krit badi badi rashiyaan bina chote khandon main toote hue vishesh dur tak aage nahin ja sakati, himandi kii ghati main ve nirantar aage parivahit hoti rahati he
 Where glaciers end and the snow melts, these large blocks fall
 sthaneey pradeshik shailon se inkaa koi matra sambandh nahin hota, isliye ve visthapit khand kehalaate hai
 While falling on the ground from the glacier, the first step on which they stick, they remain standing for many periods
 kabhi kabhi ye keval ek chote se kone ke bal girte hai or usee ke bal khadey rah jate hai
 In such a situation, their balance seems very stable and they are called misplaced segments
 ghati kii tah ke paas barf main phase hue khand apane nukile konon se tah kii shilaon ko kharonch daalate hai
 Depending on the pressure of the ice and the hardness of the rocks, these scratches are more or less deep
 kabhi kabhi bahut se chote chote khand paas paas hote hai
 All their rubbing creates many scratches in the same stone
 in khandon kii ragad himandi kii pravaah kii disha main hi lagati he, isliye sab kharonche ek duusare ke samaantar hoti he
 In this way, scratched rocks are called lined
 is vipareet kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota hai ki himandi main nitil ke paas fasaa hua koi shailakhand ghati kii tah kii kathor shilaon sein ragad khaataa hua aage badhata he, jisase tah se sata hua uskaa pashrv chikna or faldaar ho jaataa hai or anya pashrv purvawat koniya va nukile chhot jate he
 In this way, glaciers are formed at the initiative
 kabhi kabhi himandi kii ghati main avasthit shailon ke tile, barf ke apgharshan se kaaphi chikne ho jaate hai or unke pashviry kone jhad jate hai
 Most of the grease is in the part of the mound that is on the opposite side of the edge, as the ice grows by rubbing it forward
 jo bhagpashrv kii dasha main hota hai, vah jyon kaa tyon khudara or nukila chhut jaataa he
 This type of mound is called rash mouth
 adhikanshat: himandi chattaanon ke khandon ko apane upree tal par hi parivahit karti han
 The rocks of the valley's bricks continue to break in time due to the effect of the frost, which causes the rock and powder to fall on the glacier near its edges and in this way, the material transported on both sides of the glacier is called the lateral moraine
 himandi ke madhya bhaag ke upar aarambh main shailakhand praaia: bilkul nahin hote, kyonki vah bhaag ghati ke kinaaron se dur hota he
 But at the confluence of two snow-rivers, the morae to the right of one and to the left of the other do not meet, and from the confluence, the middle moren becomes
 ant main jahaan himandi samaapt hoti he or barf ke pighalane se jal banataa he, vahaan barf kii sataha par or bich main laayaa hua samast padaarth girakar ekatrit ho jaataa he
 It is called Agartastha Moren
 isamen starikaran kaa nitant abhaav hota he
 If the glaciers begin to move past their first boundary due to changes in climate, or for some other reason, the ice will continue to push forward the entire amount of the previously formed frontal moraine
 iske vipareet yadi himandi sheersh kii ore hatati ho, to agrantasth moren kaa ek aster peeche kii ore banataa chalaa jayega
 Despite occupying three quarters of the land, the sea is constantly trying to increase its expansion
 pratyaksht: uskaa kaaryakshetra tatasth pradesh he, jahaan vah apni prabal tarangon dwaara chattaanon ko chhin bhinn kar bhoomi ke oobad khaabadpan ko nasht karata hua mahadesh ko apni sataha ke baraabar chauras banane kaa praytn karata he
 Even in calm weather, the waves repeatedly hit the rocks and hurt them, but during the storm, their strength increases by a thousand times
 bade bade tufaanon kii lehren praaia: 14-15 meter unchi uthati hai
 Fen, gravel and small ballasts thrown by him have been seen jumping up to 40-50 meters high
 prayek lahar apni samast jalarashi ke bhaar se tat par aghat karti he or aisa prathit hota he maano prakruti bahut bade ghan se tatasth pradesh ko peet rahi ho
 Waves also indirectly help in their erratic action
 sabhi chattaanon main maheen daraaren or chote chote chhidr hote hai
 When the waves hit the rocks suddenly and loudly, the air filled in these cracks and holes does not get an opportunity to exit and where it compresses
 laharon kii vaapasi ke samay pani kaa dabaav hatane par hawa phir fail jaati he
 This action takes place so quickly that the air that is being spread suddenly cannot even find its way out and it acts as an explosive power in a way
 kriya ke baar baar duhraane se daraaron or chhidron ke chaaron ore kii chattane fatkar tuutane lagati hai or chhidr kramash: bade hote jate hai
 Sometimes it also happens that the cracks open on both the sea and the continent
 aisi avasthaa main laharon dwaara dabaav padane par daraar kii hawa teji se jameen kii ore nikal bhaagti he or laharon kii vaapasi par utani hi teji se phir daraar main ghus jaati he
 With this happening repeatedly, the fine holes become larger and progressively become tunnels, which are called fahmoid is prakaar tatasth chattaane laharon kii pahunch kii oonchaai par dhire-dhire khekhali hone lagati hai, jisase uuparavaali chattaanon kaa ablamb bhi kamjor hota jaataa he or ve bhi shanai: shanai: tuutakar girane lagatati hai
 Gravity also participates a lot in this activity
 jahaan chattaane kai prakaar kii hon, kuch kamjor or kuch kadi, vahaan laharon ko, vastut: kisi bhi prakritik abhiktrta ko apana kaary karne main adhik suvidha hoti he; kyonki jab kamjor chattan cat jaati he, tab usase samparkwaali kadi chattan kaa aadhaar bhi kamjor ho jaataa he or uski nijee kadai kaa mahatv kam ho jaataa he
 Due to the impact of the waves, due to the breaking of the rocks, the pieces of various sizes are fast rolled and hit on the rocks, which themselves also break and become small and chubby
 isse samudr kii aghat karne kii shakti or bhi bad jaati he
 Over time the pieces are converted into gravel
 uske baad lehren unhen pal bhar bhi vishram nahin lene deteen, nirantar apane saath aage peeche dhasitati phirti hai
 As a result, after some time the pieces of gravel become very fine and very spherical, sometimes so small that they do not even sit in the bottom and are left hanging in the water
 kanon ke is prakaar chota va gelematol karne kii laharon kii shakti nadi kii apeksha kahin adhik hoti he, kyonki ek to nadi kii tah main ragadwali gati keval ek hi disha main, nadi ke bahaav kii ore hoti he, duusare nadi kii ghati ke nichle bhaag main dhar ke kam ho jane par bade bade kan jyon ke tyon pade rah jate hai or is prakaar unki uttarottar chote hone kii kriya band ho jaati he
 The tides and other types of ocean currents also contribute to the work of the waves
 inkaa vishesh ullekhneey prabhaav sangam ke paas nadiyon kii sankri ghaatiyon main hota he, jahaan jowarbhate ke kaaran tej dharaayen utpann ho jaati hai, jo balui kinaaron or pani main nimagn chattaanon ko kshay karne kaa prayaas karti hai
 These streams carry soil and sand far away from the mouth of the river and all the coastline towards the sea
 laharon ke aghat kaa prabhaav pani kii sataha se upar nikali hui bhoomi tak hi simit nahin rahata, varan samudr ke chhichley bhaagon kii tah par bhi padataa he
 It is known from experience that often their power to decay to a depth of 30 meters remains functional
 sataha ke neeche laharon kaa kaary praaia: vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa badi hui ghaas ko hansiye se kaatane kaa, arthath yon samajhnaa chahie ki lehren apane aghat se samudr main duube hue shailon kii oonchaai main asamanta dur kar ek chauras sthaan banane kaa prayaas karti hai
 Measuring the depth of the sea from place to place, it is known that around the entire land, there is usually a flat plain at a depth of 30 meters
 is maidan kii samudri anaachhadan kaa maidan kehete hai
 The natural properties of the sea and lakes differ only in size
 samudr jahaan ati vishaal evam athaah jalarashi he, jhil apekshaakrit bahut chota jalashay he
 Due to this, the velocity of waves rising in the lake and the magnitude of tides is smaller than that of the sea
 falat: bhuprishth ke prati jhil kii apardi kriya praaia: samudr ke samaan hi hoti he, keval uski maatra jhil ke aakaar ke anuroop laghu ho jaati he
 In the above description, the description of various natural factors, the transport of erosive and non-sedative action and the depression arising from it, etc
 is described
 yahan yah baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki prayek kaarak kaa kaaryakshetra vishisht he
 He takes the undissolved and decomposed material produced by his action to the lowest place of his field of action, from where the second factor according to time and environment takes him under its influence to the lowest surface of his field
 udaahranarth, varshajal kii kriya se utpann apaghatit padaarth jal kii choti choti dhaaraon evam naaliyon dwaara nadi main pahunch jaati hai or phir nadi use samudr athwa jhil main pahunchaa detii he
 In this way, the rocks formed by the frost reach the bottom of the hill with the effect of gravity and then remain there until they are under the influence of some other factor
 himandi apni kriya se utpann avsaad ko parivahit kar apane galane ke sthaan tak le jaati he
 There his influence ceases and then he comes under the influence of the river Depression
 bhuprishth kaa sabase nichalaa sthaan samudr he
 Thus, the last point of depression resulting from erosion and decomposition of rocks is the sea
 avasthavishesh ke kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki yah padaarth maarg main kisi kisi sthaan par kuch kaal tak rukta hua aage bade; phir bhi, der saber, kabhi mand gati se, kabhi tej gati se, vah samudr kii ore yatra karata hi rahata he
 The maximum load of the depression reaching the sea is upstream
 is baat kaa pehle ullekh kiya ja chukaa he ki nadi main apane parivahit padaarth ko uske aakaar ke aadhaar par bajri, baaluu, mitti ityadi main vargeekrut karne kii shakti he
 Hence, most of the depression is divided into thick, medium and fine three sections, which are deposited at a greater distance from the coast respectively, that is, the particles near the same level of the coast will be larger and smaller in the farthest part
 
 kisi bhi ek sthaan par jyon jyon avsaad adhik maatra main sanchit hoga, vahaan kaa jal bhi apekshaakrit chhichhlaa hota jayega or iske falswaroop dhar kaa veg bhi kuch bad jayega
 Therefore, the entire depression will precipitate at some distance than before and the accumulated depression will become somewhat thicker at each place, like small sand on top of small pebbles and gravel, fine sand over thick and soil over fine sand
 kuch kaal ke uparaant or adhik avsaad ke sanchit hone se samast pradesh phir or chhichhlaa ho jayega or tab avsaad kaa nickshepan pun: ek ek pag or aage pahunchne lagenge
 If, for some reason, the bottom of the sea in the above deposition center is slowly slipping and the speed of sliding is equal to the speed of depression, then even after maximum depression has accumulated, the depth of the sea will eventually remain as it is and every The deposition of particles of the same size at the place will be continuous for a long time
 ek or dasha aisi bhi ho sakati he jab samudr kii tah ke khisakane kii gati avsaad ke sanchit hone kii gati se adhik ho jaay
 In that case the effect will be reversed and the ocean will become more and more deep even after depression accumulates
 falat: vibhinn aakaar ke kanon ke nickshepan kaa sthaan kramash: ek ek pag tat kii ore badhata jayega
 In the first and third positions mentioned above, there is a convergence of different sizes, and in the second case a depression of the same size accumulates in thick quantities
 adhikansh nadiyon dwaara laae hue avsaad kii maatra varsha rituon main bahut kam hoti he
 Therefore, during the rainy season, depression is very abundant in the ocean
 bahudhaa do uttarottar varsha rituon ke bich kii avadhi main sanchit avsaad kii maatra naganya hoti he
 In such a situation, the depression accumulates intermittently and the depression in one rainy season gives an opportunity to harden and suppress before the depression of the second season
 uparishayi jal ke bhaar se avsaad ko dabane main sahaayta milti he
 As a result, the depressions in the successive rainfall seasons are not quite mixed with the earlier depressions, but accumulate in separate layers
 is kriya ko starikabhavan kehete hai
 The thickness of each layer will depend on the amount of depression that occurs in a rainy season
 ausat main yah 2 se 4 millimetre tak hoti he
 If deposition of depression persists for many years, then obviously some thicker layers will accumulate in place in thinner thin layers, and the thickness of these levels will depend on the speed of depression and the period in which depression deposition continues uninterrupted
 staron main sanchit avsaad ke kanon kii vyavastha par bahaav kii gati or disha kii sthirataa kaa prabhaav bhi padataa he
 Fine clay and fine sand particles remain suspended in water for a long time and sit in a very quiet place
 unka nickshepan bhi apekshaakrit gahare pani main hota he, jahaan dhar ekadam shithil pad jaati he
 In such a state, the system of accumulation of particles remains constant and levels become orderly and regular
 kanon ko jamane ke liye paryaapt samay miltaa he or str samudratah ke samaantar banate chale jate hai
 On the contrary, the place of accumulation of thick sand and gravel etc
 is relatively shallow
 aise sthanon main dhar kii gati bahudhaa parivartansheel hoti he, kabhi mand ho jaati he or kabhi teevr
 In the slow state, the upper part of the accumulated depression begins to flow unfamiliarly in the state of high speed and deposits again where the edge is dim
 is prakaar pun: nickshepit padaarth pehle str ke samaantar nahin hota
 Additionally, in shallow water, where these coarse particles are deposited, the direction of the torrent often changes
 yah parivartan jowarbhata or prachand pawan ityadi ke kaaran hota rahata he
 Therefore, along with the direction of edge, the direction of depressive levels also varies locally
 is prakaar chhichley pani main sanchit avsaadeey shailon ke str bahudhaa samaantar na hokar ek duusare se kone banaate hai, jinaki maap sthaan sthaan par bhinn bhinn ho sakati he
 This phenomenon is called virtual propagation
 kabhi kabhi avsaad kshetron main aisi sthiti hoti he ki jal kii tarangon kii chhap bhi avsaadeey staron main mudrit ho jaati he
 In the shallow regions, especially in the tectonic tropics, the velocity of the waves is so high that the deposited sand and soil dance to their signals and often give them a wave form
 nae avsaad ke aane se purv yadi is tarangit baaluu ko sookhkar kuch ddadh hone kaa avasar mil jaay, to yah tarang rup surakshit rah jaataa he
 Depression often gets an opportunity to dry up and become strong in the state of depression
 isi prakaar kekadon, keedon makodon tathaa anya jantuon ke padchinh bhi jowarbhatantar pradesh main sanchit avsaad main surakshit rah ja sakate hai
 Sometimes traces of rainwater drops also become safe in these depressions
 samudr main rahanevaale naanaa prakaar ke shalkadhari jantuon ke marane ke uparaant unke shalk samudratah main sanchit hone lagate hai
 These flakes are often rolled here and there due to the flow of waves, due to which they break and crumble and join the sand and mud brought by the river
 adhikansh shalk calcium carbonate ke bane hote hai or is prakaar calciummay avsaad, baaluu or mitti banati he
 Levels of pure soil, or sand, are able to accumulate only in places where shark-bearing creatures are often absent
 kabhi kabhi shalk tuutane se purv hi avsaad main dab jate hai or us avasthaa main ve jyon ke tyon surakshit ho jate hai
 In this way, safe shells are called fossils
 samudr ke gahare bhaagon main, jahaan nadi dwaara laai hui baaluu or mitti kaa avsaad nahin pahunch paata he, shalkon ke chure kaa shuddh avsaad nickshepit hota he, jisaki raashi kalantar main bahut prachur ho sakati he
 Thus sand levels accumulate in shallow waters, soil levels in relatively few deep waters, and limestone sedimentary rocks in more deep marine parts
 shushk evam ushnatapradhan deshon main jalawaashpan bahulata se hota he
 If there is a lake in these states in which the amount of burning by the rivers and rainwater is less than that of the steam that blows, then that lake starts drying up and can be completely destroyed
 nadiyon ke pani or varshavah main saadharantaya kuch na kuch lavan ghule rahete hai
 Therefore, new salt material comes in the lake daily by the rivers
 ushnata ke prabhaav se pani bhaap banakar ud jaataa he, parantu lavan peeche hi chhot jaataa he
 Therefore, the water of the lake becomes progressively more salty or saline
 kalantar main lavan itani adhik maatra main sanchit ho saktaa he ki jhil kaa jal usase santrupt ho jaae
 Excess evaporation will cause the salt to dissolve, causing the depression to become salty
 yadi lavan ke avakshepan ke samay nadiyon dwaara laae hue avsaad kii maatra bahut kam ho, to praaia: vishuddh lavniya str avakshepit ho sakate hai
 Many lakes of Tibet are examples of this action
 vahaan varsha bahut kam hoti he, jisase jhilein uttarottar sookhti ja rahi hai or inaki tahon main lavniya str avakshepit ho rahe hai
 In Salt Ranj, Pakistan, deposits of salt and gypsum stored in the state of Khevada will be made by drying of an ancient ocean branch
 isi prakaar vibhinn prakritik abhikartaaon kii kriya se bhu-prishthiya shailon kaa kshay evam apradan nirantar ho rahaa he or usase utpann avsaad antat: samudr ke gart main sanchit hota ja rahaa he
 As the levels of depression increase, the pressure of the new material rises above the lower levels
 praaia: 300 meter mote avsaadeey staron kii daab 80 kilogram prati varg centimetre hoti he
 Therefore, when only 60 meters of mouthed levels are accumulated, the pressure at the lowest levels will often be 13 kg per square centimeter
 jalashay ke pani kii daab bhi kuch kam nahin hoti
 The pressure of water per one meter is 100 grams per square centimeter
 in sabhi daabon ke prabhaav se avsaad ke gun nikatatam aakar aapas main ek duusare se gunth jate hai
 Water escapes between them and they become dry
 jal kii patali patali jhilliyaan kanon se phir bhi chipki rah ja sakati hai or unka tanaav kanon ko paraspar judaa rakhane main sahaayta detaa he
 Generally some salts dissolve in reservoirs or underground water
 When this water flows out of the sedimentary depression, due to some different reasons some of its salts precipitated between the particles of depression, its free radicals are hardened together
 And depression transforms into hard, compact stone
 is prakaar sangyojan karanevaale lavenon main calcium carbonate, louh oxide, evam silica vishesh ullekhneey he
 Of these, silica bond is the strongest
 is prakaar bane hue pashaan kii jati avsaad ke padaarth par nirbhar hogi
 For example, a shell or shell made of sand depression, a combination of a group of buttons will form a conglomerate, etc
 yadi mitti main thodi baaluu ho, to balua shail ityadi shail banenge
 Depression in sea or other reservoirs is accumulated in levels or layers
 daab ke prabhaav se unke sampidit hone evam kisi na kisi lavan tathaa anya aadharak kii sahaayta se avsaad ke kan sanyojit ho jate hai
 Depression in this activity also remains
 avsaad se utpann hone ke kaaran inhen avsaadeey shail bhi kehete hai
 Sedimentary rock material accumulates in the bottom of the sea or other reservoirs for a long time
 kalantar main bhusanchalan aadi kisi vrut ke prabhaav se vah sagar kii tah main se upar uthakar, parvat kaa rup dhaaran kar, mahadesh kaa bhaag ban saktaa he
 This is a catastrophic change
 aisa hone se avsaadeey padaarth pun: prakritik abhikartaaon kii kriya kii prishthbhumi banaata he or unke prabhaav main aakar phir se kshay hota hua nae avsaad ko janm detaa he, jo tatkaaleen sagar kii tah main jaakar nickshepit hone lagata he
 In this way, the substance of the earth is continuously participating in a depressive cycle
 prayek chakra ke ant main sagar or mahadeshon kaa punassanthaan hota he or inamen nae thal or jal bhaagon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Usually 4 large and 14 short cycles of this type have occurred in the entire history of the Earth
 bharat ke pashchimi tat par sthit parvat shrinkhalaa ko pashchimi ghat yaa sahyadri kehete hai
 Along the western side of the Deccan Plateau, this mountain range is 1600 kilometers in length from north to south
 vishwa main jaivikeey vivadhta ke liye yah bahut mahatvapurn he or is drushti se vishwa main iskaa 8waan sthaan he
