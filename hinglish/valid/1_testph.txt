 In terms of style, this era remained an epistemological, development of subtle art could not be possible in the evocative and evocative poetry
 chhayavaad or rahasyavaad tritiy kavyadhara he
 In the 19th and 20th century, due to English educational institutions, English poetry had its impact on Hindi poetry directly and indirectly through Bengali
 at: tritiy dhara ke chhayavaadi tathaa rahasywaadee kavy main dvivediyugin sthool maryaadawad, pravachanaatmakataa or vivarnaatmak prakrutichitran ke sthaan par svachhand prem kii pukaar, preyasi kaa devikaran, antarrashtriyata or vishvamaanavvaad, prakruti or preyasi ke madhyam se nijee aashaniraashaaon kaa varnan, prakruti par chetana kaa aarope, saundarya anusandhan, alokik se prem ke kaaran dvivediyugin sthool sangharsh se palaayan, gitatmakataa, lakshan, visheshanviparyay tathaa bhashaa kaa komalikaran pratyaksh or pramukh pravritiyaan hai
 Prasad, Sumitranandan Pant, Nirala and Mahadevi made poetic ornate, metaphorical, lyrical and subtle by their artistic manifestations of nature, introspection and coincidence in nature by making indirect power the subject of love
 dvivediyugin rashtriyata kii goonj in kaviyon main yatra tatra milti he, visheshkar niraala ke badalrag, jaago phir ek baar aadi kritiyon main
 The masculine form of the Renaissance was found in Nirala and the cultural form in the Brahmanical philosophy of the Upanishads
 kamayani tritiy dhara kii sarvotkrisht kriti he jisamen rahasyamay satta kii prapti ke aavaran main purush nari, raja praja, prakruti purush or maanviya vrittiyon main samrasya sthapit karne kaa sandesh prastut kiya gaya
 In the third section Nirala replaced the free verses, Pant replaced the Sanskrit varnas with Hindi verses, Mahadevi and Prasad used lyrical songs
 prakruti or prem ke bhavy, maarmik chithran is yug kii vishisht uplabdhiyaan hai
 Impressed by English's Shelley, Keats and Bangla's Kavindra Ravindra, the Hindi mystic poetry is original and poignant in its uniqueness
 kamayani main chintaa, aashaa, vaasanadi manovritiyon, niraala ke tulsidas or ram kii shaktipuja main maansik antardvadvon, mahadevi ke geeton main mira jaisi virah vednaa or pant ke prakrutichitran main saundaryavidhan itnaa aakarshak hua he ki yah yug hindi kavy kaa swarnyug kaha jaataa he
 Language adornment and development of symbolic power reached its peak in this era
 chhayavaad ke uttarkaal main chhayavaadi sookshm, lakshanik rahasywaadee abhivyakti ke viruddh halawaad or maansalwad kaa pravartan hua
 Bachchan's authoritarian works depict the fun, madness, decadence, decadence of the Urdu poetry of Persian Urdu and the Bhogistic approach
 maansalwad main vaasana kii ghoshnaa hi pradhan hoti gai
 The disappointment of decaying romanticism in Narendra Sharma and self-knowledge is found more in Bhagavaticharan Varma
 halawaad or maansalwad ek ore to dvivediyugin sanyamvaad or paramparaagat naitiktawaad ke viruddh tha or duusari ore isamen chhayavaad kii aspasht, dhoomil, gahan premanubhuti ke sthaan par abhidhamay aatmavigyaan adhik tha
 These compositions of Urdu "tarje payeegi" became more popular among the youth
 khadi boli kii chaturth dhara pragativaad he
 Communist notions were propagated in the shadowy era itself due to the influence of the Russian state revolution
 1935-36 main pragatisheel lekhaksang kii sthapana hui
 Progressivist poets were poets influenced by Marxism
 pant ji ke ugant, yugavani, niraala kii "vah todatii pathar," "badalrang", "kukuramutta", "anima", "nae pattey" aadi dwaara iskaa rup spasht hua
 This movement appeared against the feudal-capitalist elements and reactionary tendencies in the field of literature
 janata ke daridrya, poonjipatiyon ke viruddh aakrosh, itihaas, dharm, samskruti, kala kii bhautikwaadi vyakhya, brahmavaad kaa virodh tathaa chhayavaadi alankrita style ke viruddh abhidhaavaadi style kaa prayog is dhara kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai
 In Chhayavad, adornment and in progressivism, Karun, Veer and Rodra Rasas got more expression
 kintu dvivediyug ke sadrush is yug main pun: sthulata kaa aagaman hua, isamen kala kam garjan tarjan, udgaar adhik milte hai
 Rangeya Raghav, Dinkar, Kedarnath Aggarwal, Shivamangalsingh Suman, Nagarjuna, Bhagavaticharan Varma Shamsher, Pant Ji, Gajanan, Muktibodh, Ram Vilas Sharma, Uday Shankar Bhatt, Anchal, Narendra Sharma etc
 created progressive poetry
 premchand kaa "hans" is sahitya kaa mukhpatr tha
 Progressivists declared the reality of life against the Shadowists
 prakruti ko remani drushti se na dekhakar use jivan kii vaastaviktaa ke sandarbh main rakhkar dekha he
 Satire has developed the most in progressive poetry
 pragativaad aaj bhi ek jeevant kavyadhara he, usne ab hunkaratmak rup chhodkar adhik sookshm or kalamay rup apanaaya he
 The fifth stream of Khadi Boli poetry is called experimentalism

 Devraj, Shambhunath Singh, Jagdish Gupta, Dharmaveer Bharti, Raghuveer Sahay, Shamsher , Poetic collections of Balakrishna Rao, Lakshmikant Varma etc
 and the form of experimentalism became clear
 yah kavy mukhyat: chhayavaadi romani drushti or alankruti tathaa pragativaadee angadhata ke viruddh "rupavaadi andolan he
 The inspiration of Shadowism was the romantic poetry of English and the inspiration of experimentalism was the symbolism of Europe, surrealism, existentialism and modern paintingism
 pragatisheel prayogvaadiyon par europea prabhaav keval shilp kii drushti se hi he kintu prayogvaadi kathy ke virdohi prayogvaadiyon par ukt prabhaav adhik ghaneebhoot he; isamen vyakti kii astitv ashanka, anasthaa, avsaad, niraashaa, bhramanaash, saamaajikta ke viruddh vyaktvaad, mahatta ke sthaan par "laghutavaad" avchetansthit kuntha, aadi ko pratikatmak or bimbaatmak style main vyakt kiya gaya he
 Intellectualism in place of "rasa", an attempt to represent the text as symbols and images, new uses of language, emphasis on conversational and rhetorical styles, expressions of esoteric and hitherto untouched subjects are the highlights of this section
 pracheen aakhyaanon kaa naveen prashnon ko prastut karne ke liye prayog kiya gaya he
 In terms of verses, this stream is completely free
 "chhandgandh" maatr hi is nae kavy main adhik he
 Emphasis has been laid on the use of the Arthala in place of the word, although many poets use prose as well as free verses
 chitrakala ke prabhaavvaad, bhavishyavaad, yathaadrishywad tathaa tii
 es
 iliyat, ezara pound, badleir, malaamen, rilke, rimbon aadi kaviyon kii kala se nai kavita atyadhik prabhavit he

 The new stream is the best stream of standing bid
 bachchan, niraj, virendra mishra, shambhunath singh, rang, ramanath avasthi, thakurprasad sih, anchal, surendra tiwari, som, kamalesh, kedarnath singh, giradhar gopal, ramavatar tyaagi, girzakumar maathur, kailas vaajapeyi, raahi, suman or nepali aadi geetkaaron ne prem, prakruti or samaaj ke vishay main nutan aprastut vidhaan dwaara padarthchhaviyon or bhaawanaaon ko vaani di he
 These poets are characterized by the use of relatively simple and unambiguous language, the desire to demilitarize non-sensual feelings, and the desire to gain greater publicity in conferences
 nai kavita kii paripati par "nae geet" bhi aaj ke kavy kii uplabdhi he
 In addition to these new streams, the management poems are also written in the traditional style
 takshashila, noorjehan,, urmila, siddharth or vardhman, daityavansh, chhatrasaal parvati aadi aise hi kavy hai
 Here, the management poems have also been written on Gandhi, Premchand, Meera etc

 NBA seasons Analgesic nephropathy is damage to the kidneys caused by analgesic drugs such as phenacetin, paracetamol and aspirin
 is shabd kaa istemaal aamtaur par in dawaaon ke sangyojan kaa sandarbh dete hai jinke atyadhik upyog se nuksaan ho saktaa he, vishesh rup se ve sangyojan jinamein phenasatin shaamil hon
 is shabd kaa istemaal kisi ek peedaaharak dawa se gurde ko hue nuksaan kaa varnan karne ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Typical renal diseases caused by analgesics are renal papillary necrosis and chronic intraarterial nephritis
 ve donon aamtaur par rakt kaa pravaah kam hone ke kaaran, antioxident ke teji se upbhog or gurde ko hone vaali uttarvarti oxidetive kshati ke kaaran hote hai
 This kidney damage can result in progressive renal dysfunction, abnormal diuretics, hypertension, or anemia
 ek vishisht samudaay ke log jo kii peedaaharak vrikkavikruti ke rog se grast he antim charan kii gurde kii beemaari ko viksit kar sakate hai
 Analgesic nephropathy was at one time the common cause of kidney damage and end-stage kidney disease in Australia and many areas of the United States
 adhikansh kshetron main, 1970 or 1980 ke dashak main phenastin ke upyog main kami aane ke baad isamen tezi se giravat ai
 Analgesics are a class of drugs that are widely used in the treatment of pain
 inamen aspirin or anya gaiyr steroodel sujan-rodhi dawaaen shaamil hai or saath hi antipyreeticparacitamol or phenacetin shaamil hai
 After coming into existence in the early 19th century, phenacetin was a common component of compounding of analgesics in Australia, Europe, and the United States
 in mishrit peedaaharakon main aamtaur par aspirin phenacetin, paracitamol yaa salicyllamide or caffiin yaa kodin sahit anya NSAID maujuud hote hai
 In the 1950s, Spooler and Zollinger reported the association between excessive use of phenacetin and kidney damage
 inhone kaha ki phenacetin kaa upyog karne vaale puraane logon main kuch vishisht bimariyaan jaise, vrikkeey papila koshikakshay or chirkaari antaraleey vrikkashoth ke sankraman kii zyada sambhaavna thi
 This condition was termed analgesic nephropathy and phenacetin was attributed to it, although no absolute causal role was demonstrated
 yadhyapi aage kii reporte, jiske anusaar phenacetin ke atyadhik upyog se gurde ko haani kii sambhaavna bad jaati thi, ko kai deshon main 60 or 80 ke dashak main pratibandhit kar diya gaya| As the use of phenacetin decreased, so did the prevalence that analgesic nephropathy is the cause of end-stage kidney disease
 udhaaharan ke liye, switsraland,ke data ke mutabik rogiyon main uparokt vyapti 1981 main 28% se ghatakar 1990 main 12% ho gayi thi| switzraland main hi ek shav pariksha adhyayan ke baad yah suzav diya gaya tha ki aam janata main peedaaharak vrikkshoth ke prati vyapti main 1980 main 3% se 2000 main 0
2% tak kii giravat dekhi gayi|
 Although these data may assume that analgesic nephrocyte has been eliminated in almost all areas, the situation is still not as good in some other areas
 vishesh rup se, belgium main, dialysis rogiyon ke bich analgesic nephropti kii vyapaktaa 1984 main 17
9% or 1990 main 15
6% thi
 Michelsen and De Scheper have suggested that the prevalence of analgesic nephropathy is not due to non-phenacetin analgesics among dialysis patients in Belgium, but because Belgium accepts a higher proportion of elderly patients for dialysis
 in lekhakon ke anusaar, peedaharak apvrikkata kaa anupaat adhik he kyonki belgium main un dialysis rogiyon kaa pratishat adhik he jo qi phenacetin kaa lambey samay tak upyag kiya he

 How phenacetin and other analgesics lead to this loss is far from understood
 vartmaan main yah mana jaataa he ki NSAID kii gurda sambandhi vishaaktataayen or jvaranashi phenacetin or paracitamol aapas main kriya karke peedaaharak nefropathy kaa nirmaan karte hai
 a 2000 Committee of Investigators associated with analgesic nephropathy reported in 2000 that they had not yet found solid evidence linking non-phenacetin analgesics to analgesic nephropathy
 uchit gurda karypranali paryaapt rakt ke pravaah par nirbhar karata he
 Kidney blood flow is a complex, controlled process that depends on many hormones and small molecules such as prostaglandin
 saamaanya paristhitiyon main, gurde dwaara utpaadit prostaglandin E2 gurde main paryaapt rakt pravaah ke liye aavashyak he
 Like prostaglandin, PGE 2 syntheses all depend on cyclooxygenases
 aspirin or anya NSAID cycluxijences nishedhak rahe hai
 In the kidney, this inhibition results in a decrease in the concentration of PGE 2 leading to decreased blood flow
 kyonki gurde main rakt sarvapratham vrikk praantastha main or phir gurde majja main pravaahit hoti he, isliye gurde kaa andruni bhaag rakt pravaah ke prati bada hi samvedansheel hota he
 The renal papilla, the innermost part of the renal structures, relies exclusively on prostaglandin to maintain adequate blood flow
 isliye cycluxijences ke nishedh se vrikkeey papila ko kshati pahunchati he, is prakaar vrikkeey papila koshikakshay kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 Most healthy kidneys reserve adequate physiological reservations to compensate for the decrease in nsaid-induced blood flow
 haalanki, phenacetin yaa parasitamol se atirikt kshati hone par vah peedaaharak vrikkshoth kaa rup le sakati he
 It is not clear how phenacetin causes injury to the kidneys
 Beck and Hardy have proposed that phenacetin metabolites cause lipid peroxidation that damages kidney cells
 paracitamol phenacetin kaa pramukh metabolit he jo ek vishisht yantriki prakriya se gurde ko haani pahunchataa he
 In renal cells, cyclooxygenase catalyzes the conversion of paracetamol to n-acetal-p-benzocumine
 NAPQI vikaar anzimi sanyugman dwaara glutathione kaa ksharan karata he jo ki prakritik rup se ek antioxident he| glutathione kii kami se, koshikaayen oxidative kshati ke prati adhik samvedansheel ho jaati he
 Common symptoms in patients with analgesic nephropathy include headache, anemia, hypertension, and white cells in the urine
 peedaaharak vrikkshoth se grasit kuch vyaktiyon ke mutr main protiyaan bhi ho sakati he
 The prognosis of this disease is traditionally determined by clinical discovery, based on findings based on excessive use of painkillers
 yah anumaan he ki 2 or 3 kilo aspirin yaa phenacetin ke seven ke baad hi peedaaharak vrikkshoth ke lakshan saamne aate hai| Once suspected, analgesic nephropathy can be confirmed with precision by tomography
 ek pareekshan main siti imaging par jhallon kaa khariksanchay 92% samvedansheel or shat pratishat vishistataa ke saath peedaaharak apvrikkata kaa nidaan kiya gaya tha
 == Complications Complications of analgesic nephropathy include phyllonephritis and end-stage renal disease
 galat purvanumaan ke liye sambhavit jokhim karkon main aavartak mutr path sankraman or lagaataar badhata raktchaap bhi shaamil hai| peedaaharak apvrikkata se mutr pranali ke cancer ke viksit hone kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 Treatment of analgesic nephropathy begins with discontinuation of painkillers, which often prevents the disease from progressing and may also bring the kidney back to normal

 ek-ek karke nau sir chadhaane ke baad dasavaan sir bhi kaatane ko hi tha ki shivaji prasann hokar prakat ho gayi
 He turned his head ten times and asked him to ask for a boon
 ravan ne lanka main jaakar us ling ko sthapit karne ke liye use le jane kii ajna maangi
 Shivji gave permission, but gave this warning that if he puts it on the road, it will become immovable there
 antatogatva vahi hua
 Ravana walked with Shivalinga, but on coming to a Chitabhoomi on the way, he needed a brief retirement
 ravan us ling ko ek ahir ko thama laghushanka-nivritti karne chalaa gaya
 Here, he felt very heavy from that Ahir and placed it on the ground
 phir kya tha, lautne par ravan puri shakti lagaakar bhi use na ukhaad sakaa or niraash hokar murti par apana angutha gadaakar lanka ko chalaa gaya
 Here the gods of Brahma, Vishnu etc
 came and worshiped that Shivling
 shivaji kaa darshan hote hi sabhi devi devataaon ne shivlinga kii vahiin usee sthaan par pratisthapana kar di or shiv-stuti karte hue waapas swarg ko chale gayi
 According to public opinion and popular belief, this vaidyanath-jyotirlinga is going to give desired results

 Twinkle Khanna is also producing and directing the film
 tvinkal khanna kii duusari kitaab ‘da legend of lakshmi prasad’ kaa aakhri adhyay isi film se judaa hua he
 The story begins with the marriage of Lakshmi and Gayatri, who are a happy and lucky couple
 lakshmi apni patni ko behad pyaar karata tha or uske liye kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar tha
 Due to a conservative thinking in the village about menstruation, during that time Gayatri was not allowed to do household work and during that five days she had to sleep separately from her husband in another bed
 gaanv ke yuvaaon ke dwaara ise 'auraton kaa paanch din kaa test match' bhi kaha gaya jiske vishay main lakshmi bilkul anbhigya tha, lakshmi is par shant tha lekin maahvaaree ke dauraan jab vah apni patni gayatri ko fate-puraane gande kapadey istemaal karte hue dekhtaa to use acha nahin lagata or vah pareshaan ho jaataa he
 When she talks to Gayatri on this subject, she says that it has nothing to do with men and as a man she has no need to interfere with women, they are her case, she has dealt with it herself
 Will take
 in sabake baavjood bhi lakshmi ko rahaa nahin gaya or wo medical store par jaakar ₹55 kaa ek sainitory napkin apni patni ke liye laata he
 When Lakshmi takes her home and gives her into Gayatri's hands, Gayatri convinces her and convinces her that each month she cannot use such an expensive pad
 lakshmi use waapas nahin karata he
 He returns desperately to his work where an artisan gets hurt
 lakshmi bina kuch soche-samajhe uski chot par sainitory napkin kaa istemaal karata he taaki rakt pravaah kam ho sake
 On the other hand, others consider it as 'unholy'
 iske baad lakshmi turant us karigar ko aspataal le jaataa hai jahaan doctor lakshmi ko shaabaashi dete hai or kehete hai ki raktasrav rokane ke liye sainitory napkin kaa istemaal ek behatar vikalp he
 Lakshmi is very happy and thinks of a solution
 phir vah kuch rooyee, kapade or gond apane dost se letaa he taaki vah alpakaaleen pad banane sake jo zyada mahangaa bhi na ho
 He gives this pad made by him to Gayatri for use
 lekin lakshmi kaa yah plan asafal hota he, jiske kaaran raat main gayatri ke kapade kharaab ho jate hai or wo raat bhar apni sari dhulkar uskaa daag mitaane kii koshish karti he
 Gayatri once again tells Lakshmi not to interfere in the matter of women
 lakshmi uski baton par dhyaan nahin detaa he or vah chori-chhipe apni pados kii ek ladki ko apni banaayi hui pad istemaal karne ko detaa he, jo ki phir ek lokapvaad kaa kaaran banataa he
 He then meets a medical student, who is ready to help him using the pad made by Lakshmi, but the student's friend refuses
 lakshmi use chaatra se dobaaraa miltaa he ye pataa lagane ke liye ki uskaa pad apana kaam rahaa he yaa nahin? lekin in donon kii mulaakaat ko lakshmi kii ek kareebi rishtedaar dekh leti hai, jiske baad se gayatri ko lagata he ki lakshmi kaa kisi anya mahila ke saath gaiyr-sambandh chal rahaa he
 Lakshmi presents her sister as a sanitary pad as a gift on the occasion of Rakshabandhan, which causes her sister to suffer embarrassment in front of her mother-in-law
 in sabhi ghatnaon ke baad gayatri lakshmi ko apni kasam detii he or kahati he ki vah apane is kaam main kisi ko bhi shaamil nahin karegaa
 Lakshmi does not come out of it
 gayatri ke lakh manaa karne ke baavjood wo phir koi duusari takanic dhundta he or vah nishchit karata he ki vah iskaa prayog swany par karegaa
 He takes the goat's blood from his friend and stuffs it into a balloon and adds a pump to it and then uses a pad over it
 lekin ek baar phir uski ye yojana asafal hoti he or saarvajanik sthal main uskaa pant khun se lathpath ho jaataa he
 After this incident, the villagers declare him insane, who is not fit to live in the society
 in sabhi kaarnon se gayatri kaa bhai use lakshmi se dur le jaataa he or phir lakshmi gaanv chhodane kaa nishchay karata he taaki vah in sabase ladakar masik dharm jaise kalank ko mitaa sake 
 Lakshmi then enrolls in a college so that she can find out the things used in sanitary pads
 khaane-pine, rahane or paison kii aavashyaktaaon ke kaaran vah ek professor ke yahaan kaam karne lagata he taaki uski rozmarra kii jaruratein puri ho sake
 The son of the professor helps Lakshmi by collecting every information related to the sonitary pad with the help of internet
 wo ek international company ke jariye kuch selulos fibre jo ki pad banane main istemaal hota he use lakshmi ke liye mangaata he
 This work done by Lakshmi makes the professor very angry and the video of a machine making pads costing crores shows Lakshmi so that she can get back from making it
 in sabake baavjood lakshmi apni hi mashin se pad banane kaa nishchay karata he
 He borrows some money and makes pads exactly like an ideal sanitary pad but he has no one to tell him to use it
 achaanak uski mulaakaat pari se hoti he, jise pad kii jarurat hoti he
 Medical shops are also closed due to excessive night and then Lakshmi gives her a pad made with her own hands
 agle din lakshmi pari ke paas jaataa he or pari se pad ke vishay main poochta he
 Pari is shocked and reveals that he was just like an ordinary pad
