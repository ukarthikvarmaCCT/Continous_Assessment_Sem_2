 It consists of repetition of meaning, not of word
 'transleshan' shabd kaa vyutpattimulak arth he 'parvahan' arthath ek sthaan-bindu se duusare sthaan-bindu par le janaa
 This is a place-point language text
 isamen bhi le jaai jane vaali vastu arth hota he, shabd nahin
 The difference in both the above words is in terms of etymological meaning, hence superficial
 vaastavik vyavhaar main donon kii samanta spasht he
 The repetition of meaning is called in other words and by interpretation, the interpretation of meaning, in which the morphological-constitutive features of the original language are sometimes transposed into the target language
 vastutah 'anuwaad' shabd kaa bhartiya parampara vaala arth aadhunik sandarbh main bhi maanya he or isi ko kendra bindu banaakar anuwaad kii prakruti ko anshashah samajha jaataa he
 Accordingly, there are three references to translation work - bilingual, dialectical and intertextual
 sambhashik sandarbh main arth kii punrariti ek hi bhashaa kii seemaa ke antargat hoti he, parantu iske aayam bhinn-bhinn ho jate hai
 The main dimensions are two - chronological and synchronous
 kalkramik aayam par sambhashik anuwaad ek hi bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas kii do nearesth avasthaaon main hota he, jaise, puraani hindi se aadhunik hindi main anuwaad
 Synchronous translation on the synchronous dimension mainly takes place at three levels - dialect, style and medium
 boli str par sambhashik anuwaad ke chaar upstar ho sakate hai : From one geographical dialect to another geographical dialect; Like in Braj to Awadhi
 amanak boli se maanak boli main; jaise ganjam oriya se puri kii oriya main athwa nagpur marathi se pune marathi main
 Dialectively in language form, like Braj or Awadhi to Hindi ek saamaajik boli se duusari saamaajik boli main, jaise ashikshiton yaa alpashikshiton kii bhashaa se shikshiton kii bhashaa main yaa ek dharm main dikshit logon kii bhashaa se anya dharm main dikshit logon kii bhashaa main
 At the genre level, bilingual translation can also be seen as genre-substitute
 iskaa ek acha udhaaharan he aupchaarik style se anaupchaarik style main anuwaad; jaise ‘dhumrapaan varjit he' → ‘bidi cigarette pinaa manaa he' 
 Similarly, there is no symmetry in 'tubular air transfusion'
 he' -> 'tair kii hawa nikal gai he' 
 From the point of view of medium, there is a situation of linguistic translation where the message presented in the oral medium is repeated in the written medium or vice versa; For example, there is a sentence in the oral medium: "due to the time limit, i will not be able to tell my listeners about this in more detail
 " isi ko likhit madhyam main is prakaar se kahana sambhavtah uchit mana jaataa he : "sthaan kii seemaa ke kaaran main apane pathakon ko adhik vistaar se is vishay kaa spashtikaran nahin kar sakunga
 "
 sambhashik anuwaad ke uparyukt udaahranon se do baaten spasht hoti hai
 In the process of semantics or repetition of meaning, both words and syntax are affected
 madhyam anuwaad main svanaprakriya kii visheshtaayen likhit vyavastha kii visheshtaon kaa rup le leti hai yaa iske vipareet hota he
 There is not a rigid dividing line between the dimensions of dialect, style, and medium, but only partial overlap is found in them, the possibility of which lies in the tendency to use language
 jaise, shailigat anuwaad kii aanshik satta madhyam anuwaad main dikhaai detii he, or tadnusaar 'ke vishay main bataa paanaa' jaisaa maukhik madhyam kaa, at ev anaupchaarik, chayan, likhit madhyam main aupchaarikta kaa sparsh letaa hua 'kaa spashtikaran kar sakna' ho jaataa he
 Similarly, in stylistic translation, social spoken translation is also sometimes included
 jaise, shikshiton kii boli main, aupchaarik style kii pradhanta kii pravriti ho sakati he or alpashikshiton yaa ashikshiton kii boli main anaupchaarik style kii
 Problems of bilingual translation are not only interesting but also important in terms of other bilingual translation
 anuwaad ko bhashaprayog kii ek vidha ke rup main dekhne par sambhashik anuwaad kaa mahatva or bhi spasht ho jaataa he
 Apart from this, understanding the nature of bilingual translation is not only helpful, but also necessary in terms of understanding the nature of other bilingual translation
 ye kaha ja saktaa he ki anuwaad vyutpann bhashaprayog he, jiske do sandarbh hai - sambhashik or anybhashik
 In this context, there is a difference in translation behavior, but in both cases the nature of translation remains the same
 anybhashik anuwaad do bhashaaon ke bich main hota he
 These two languages are recognized as independent languages on a coordinated criterion of historicity and regionality
 aitihaasik drushti se ek hi dhara main aane vaali bhashaaon ko saamanytah us sthiti main swatantra bhashaa ke rup main dekhte hai yadi vah kalkram main ek duusare ke nikat sannihit na hon, jaise sanskrit or hindi; in donon ke madhya praakrit bhashaayen aa jaati hai
 Likewise, in terms of regionalism, even if they are highly respected in the Adivasi languages, they will have to consider different languages, such as Hindi and Punjabi
 anybhashik anuwaad ke sandarbh main sambandhit bhashaaon kaa swatantra astitv mahatva kii baat hoti he
 Other bilingual translation is more important socially and practically than the linguistic translation
 bhashaprayog kii drushti se anybhashik anuwaad kii samasyaon main sambhashik anuwaad kii samasyaon se gunatmak antar dikhaai padataa he
 Thus, despite relating to bilingual translation, other bilingual translation is relatively private business
 anuwaad shabd ke uparyukt donon sandarbh apekshaakrit simit hai
 In these, translation has been considered as the trade of languages
 vastutah bhashaa-sanket, sanketon kii ek vishisht shrenee he, jinke dwaara sampreshan kaary sampann hota he
 Signs of different categories are used for communication
 inhen saamaanya sanket kaha jaataa he
 From this point of view, the word translation is also defined
 iske anusaar ek sanketon dwaara kahi gai baat ko dusri koti ke sanketon dwaara punah kahana is prakaar ke anuwaad ko antarasanketaparak anuwaad kaha jaataa he
 It is under general signology
 bhashik sanketon ko pravartan bindu maanakar sanketon ko bhashik or bhashetar main vibhakt kiya jaataa he
 There are two parts in Bhashaatar - external and internal
 anuwaad kii drushti se sanket-parivartan ke vyapaar kii nimnlikhit kotiyaan ban sakati hai : 1
 Translation of external signs into external signs - Accordingly, a map of a country is a translation of that country; a picture of a creature is a translation of that creature
 2
 bahya sanket kaa bhashik sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi praani ke liye kisi bhashaa main prayukt koi shabd us praani kaa anuwaad he
 From this point of view, this is really the problem of language philosophy, which has been interpreted in the hint theory of meaning
 3
 aantarik sanket se aantarik sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi ek ghatana ko uski samshil samvednaa main parivartit karnaa is shrenee kaa anuwaad he
 It is clear that this situation cannot be the real authority
 atah keval saiddhanthikta kii dashti se hi yah koti nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 4
 Translation from internal signs to linguistic signs - According to this, the use of a word for any internal sensation is a translation of this category
 isko adhik spashtataa se kaha jaataa he ki, kisi bhautik sthiti ke saath sampark hone par - jaise, kisi durghatana ko dekhakar, prakruti ke kisi drishy ko dekhakar, kisi vastu ko haath lagaakar, kuch sanghakar; duusare shabdon main indriyaarth sannikarsh hone par - man main jis samvednaa kaa udai hota he vah ek prakaar kaa sanket he
 For him, using any language word or repeating it with linguistic signs will be called translation of this category
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vishisht prakaar kii vednaa kaa sanket karne ke liye hindi main ‘shok' shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or duusari ke liye 'prem' kaa
 One sensation is believed to be translated by the word 'mourning' and the other by 'love'
 is drushti se yah kaha jaataa he ki samast moulik abhivyakti anuwaad he
 The speaker or writer repeats their sensory signals into linguistic signs
 is drushti se yah bhashaa manovigyaan kii samasya he, jisaki vyakhya uddipan-anukriya siddhanth main kii gai he
 Thus, translations have the place of translations of all three references in the wider range of the word - linguistic translation, linguistic translation, and intertextual translation
 teenon kaa apana-apana saiddhanthik aadhaar he
 It is important to know the difference between these three
 anuvadak ko yah sthir karnaa he ki in teenon main kendriya sthiti kiski he tathaa shesh do kaa unke saath kaisaa sambandh he
 From the point of view of theoretical justification, the position of dialectical translation is central
 keval ‘anuwaad' shabd se anybhashik anuwaad kaa arth grahan kiya jaataa he
 Its root is bilingualism
 anuvadak kaa bodhan tathaa abhivyakti donon sthitiyon main hi bhashaa se bandhe rahete hai or ye bhashaayen bhi bhed kii drushti se nahin, api tu code kii drushti se bhinn-bhinn hoti hai; jaise hindi or angreji, hindi or sindhi aadi
 This central position has two ends
 pratham chor par donon sthitiyon main bhashabaddhata rahati he, parantu bhashaa vahi rahati he
 The difference of positions is based on the difference of differences in the same language
 yah sambhashik anuwaad he
 For clarity of the use of technical terms, it is called 'exploration' or 'translation'
 doosar chor par bhashetar sanket kaa bhashik sanket main parivartan hota he
 This change of signaling method leads to the normal state of language use
 paribhaashik shabdaawalee main ise 'bhashaa vyavhaar' kaha jaataa he
 These three have both relation and difference
 yah sambandh ubhaynishth he
 The important thing from the translation point of view is that translators are helped by concepts of bilingual translation and intertextual translation in the actual translation work and in the evaluation of translated text
 yah aavashyaktaa tabhi mukhar rup se saamne aati he, jab anuwaad karte-karte anuvadak kabhi atak jate hai -mul paath kaa samyak bodhan nahin ho paaten, lakshyabhasha main shuddh or upyukt anuwaad kaa paryaaptatya anveshan karne main kathinaayee hoti he, anuvadak ko yah jaanchna hota he ki anuwaad kitna safal he, ityadi
 In the parlance, the word 'translation' refers to the dialectical translation
 or isi kaaran shaniah shaniah yah baat siddhanth kaa bhi ang ban gai he ki anuwaad do bhashaaon ke madhya hone vaali prakriya he
 This condition is accepted
 sanskrit parampara kaa 'chaaya' shabd isi sthiti kaa sanket karne ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he
 The definition of translation is particularly helpful for understanding the nature of translation
 anuwaad kii bahupaksheeyata ko dekhte hue anuwaad kii paribhaasha vibhinn drushtikonon se prastut kii gai he
 The main approaches are of three types - translation is a process
 anuwaad ek prakriya athwa / or uskaa parinaam he
 Translation is the name of a relation
 is drushtikon ke antargat nimnlikhit paribhaashaayen uddhrut kii jaati hai : "translation is the act of presenting the equivalent message in the target language
 sandeshon kii yah moolyasmata pehle arth or phir style kii drushti se, tathaa nikatatam evam swaabhaavik hoti he
 " "anuwaad vah prakriya he, jiske dwaara sarthak anubhav ek bhashaa-samudaay se duusare bhashaa-samudaay ko sampreshit kiya jaataa he
 " "ek bhashaa kii paathyasaamagree ko duusari bhashaa kii samanarthak paathyasaamagree dwaara prasthaapit karnaa anuwaad kehalaata he
 " "anuwaad ek shilp he jisamen ek bhashaa main likhit sandesh ke sthaan par duusari bhashaa ke usee sandesh ko prastut karne kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 " iske antargat nimna likhit paribhaasha ko uddhrut kiya jaataa he : "the process of transferring a product from one language or linguistic to another language or linguistic or its result is called translation
 " Under this comes the following definition: "anuwaad ek sambandh he, jo do yaa do se adhik paathon ke bich hota he; ye paath samaan sthiti main samaan prakaarya sampadit karte hai 
 " anuwaad kii paribhaashaon kaa yah vargeekaran jahaan anuwaad kii prakruti kii bahupaksheeyata ko spasht karata he, vahaan isse yah sanket bhi miltaa he ki, vibhinn uddeshyon ke anusaar anuwaad kii paribhaashaayen bhi bhinn-bhann ho sakati hai
 Thus all these definitions are valid
 in paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par anuwaad ke do paksh maane jate hai
 There are two sides to translation - first the operational side at the dynamic and the second theoretical aspect at the positional point
 sankriyaatmak drushti se anuwaad ek prakriya he
 The aspect of translation is related to the act of translation for which it is considered appropriate to use the word 'translation work'
 saiddhanthik drushti se anuwaad ek sambandh he jo do yaa do se adhik, parantu vibhinn bhashaaon ke paathon ke madhya hota he; parantu ve samanarthak hone chaiye
 This relationship is inaugurated by the study of comparative method
 in donon kaa samanvit rup is dharna main miltaa he ki anuwaad ek nishpatti he - kaary kaa parinaam anuwaad he - jo apane mul paath se paryaayta ke sambandh se judaa he
 The translation is called 'translated text' as a form of objection
 is drushti se ek mul paath ke anek anuwaad ho sakate hai
 In this way, where translation from an operational point of view is known as a mode of language use, in theoretical terms its relation is linked to the question of language relations based on techniques of language text comparison and contrast analysis
 anuwaad ko anuprayukt bhashavigyaan kii shakha kaha gaya he
 In fact, in its form, it is the connecting link of its process form and related form definitions, the operational basis of which is the translated text, the core of which is the notion of 'translation is a fallacy'
 in paribhaashaon se anuwaad ke vishay main jo anya jaankaree milti he, wein banduuvaar nimna prakaar se hai - Translation is from one language or language to another language or language distinction
 yah prakriya, parivartan, sthaanantaran, pratisthaapan, yaa punrariti kii prakruti kii hoti he
 The object to be transferred can be renumbered with different names, such as text, meaningful experiences, information, messages
 ye vibhinn naam anuwaad kii saiddhanthik prishthbhumi ke vibhinn yomon tathaa anuwaad kaary ke uddeshyon main antar se jude hai
 As such, the assurance expressed by the name linguistic 'textual content' is characteristic of the linguistic basis of translation, which is particularly used in machine translation
 'soochna' or 'sarthak anubhav' anuwaad ke samajabhashagat aadhaar kaa sanket karte hai; or ‘sandesh' se anuwaad kii pathasanketaparak prishthbhumi uplakshith hoti he
 The specialty of the above is that it has the same meaning in both languages
 yah arth kii samanta vyapak drushti se hoti he or bhashik arth se lekar sandarbhamulak arth tak vyaapt rahati he
 In short, the translation of a specific language of a particular language into another language in such a way as to translate it into another language, in which it implies the linguistic meaning of the original, the meaning derived from the characteristics of the application, the features of the application and style, the content, and the associated cultural features
 The second language reader seems naturally admissible while preserving
 beesvin sadi ko anuwaad kaa yug kaha gaya he
 Although translation is said to be one of the most ancient occupations or professions, it is not believed to have attained its importance in the twentieth century
 iskaa mukhya kaaran mana gaya he ki beesvin shatabdi main hi bhashasmpark arthath bhinn bhashabhashi samudaayon main sampark kii sthiti pramukh rup se armbh hui
 Its root causes are considered to be economic and political
 falswaroop, vishwa kaa aarthik-raajnneetik maanchitr parivartit hone laga
 In the present Yag, if one language is predominant in most of the nations, then one or more languages appear on the secondary post
 duusare shabdon main, ek hi raajnneetik-prashasnic ikai kii seemaa ke antargat bhashaayi bahusankhyak bhi rahete hai or bhashaayi alpsankhyak bhi
 In democracy, the right of all people to participate equally in administration is considered meaningful only when they are approached through their language
 isse bahubhashikta kii sthiti utpann hoti he or uske sangrakshan kii prakriya main anuwaad kaary kaa aashray lenaa anivaary ho jaataa he
 In addition to this, a new consciousness of the imperative and importance of translation work appears to be growing strongly due to the increasing exchanges between various nations at the international level, political, economic, scientific and technological, and literary and cultural levels
 atah anuwaad ek vyapak tathaa bahudhaa anivaary or tarksangat sthiti maani jaati he
 The importance of translation is understood more clearly in two different, but related contexts: social and practical importance, academic and cognitive significance
 saamaajik sandarbh main anuwaad vyapaar anaupchaarik paristhitiyon main hota he
 It is related to the state of bilingualism
 dwibhashikta kaa saamaanya arth he ek samay main do bhashaaon kaa vaikalpik rup se prayog
 There is a large part of the society of the present era, which uses the alternative of two languages in an informal state of social context
 saamaanya rup se prayek shikshit vyakti, nagareey parivesh kaa ardh shikshit vyakti, do bhinn bhashabhashi rajyon ke seemaa pradesh main rahane vaali janata, tathaa bhashaayi alpsankhyak, inamen adhik spasht rup se dwibhashikta kii sthi dekhi jaati he
 This bilingualism is usually of dependent / joint bilingualism
 jiskaa saamaanya lakshan yah he ki, sab ek bhashaa main sochate hai, parantu anya bhashaa main abhivyakt karte hai
 In this case it is mandatory to have the translation process
 parantu yah prakriya anaupchaarik rup main hi hoti he
 Individuals translate their mind from first language to other language and say their words
 yah mana gaya he ki, anya bhashaa parivesh main anya bhashaa sikhte samay anuwaad kaa pratyaksh rup se astitv rahata he
 If another language is learned in the self-language environment, a "code" change occurs, in which the state of translation becomes somewhat indirect
 atah dwibhashi rup main sabhi anuwaad anaupchaarik hai
 In this context, translation appears to play an important role in social language practice
 shaikshanik evam gyanatmak sandarbh main anuwaad vyapaar aupchaarik sthiti main hota he
 It has two distinctions: translation as means and translation as practicable
 saadhan rup main anuwaad kaa prayog bhashaa shikshan kii ek vidhi ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The practice of translation as a cognitive skill reinforces two skills of language learning - comprehension and expression
 isi prakaar saadhan rup main anuwaad ke do or kshetra hai : bhashaaon kaa tulanaatmak vyatireki adhyayan tathaa tulanaatmak sahitya vivechan
 In fact, it is through translation to study and analyze languages that a person knows what words mean in a sentence
 uske pashchaat hi vah donon main samanta tathaa asamanta ke bindu se avgat ho paata he
 Therefore, heterogeneous language analysis has also been called prescriptive analysis
 tulanaatmak sahitya vivechan main saahitiyon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan ke saadhan rup main anuwaad ke prayog ke dwaara sadrush-visadrush anshon kaa arthbodh hota he, jisase anshon kii tulana kii ja sake
 Apart from this, practicing translation of works of other language literature or / and reading them in translated form is an example of the contribution of translation in comparative literature discussion
 saadhy rup main anuwaad vyapaar anek kshetron main dikhaai padataa he
 Koshkarya is also a kind of translation work
 sambhashik kosh main ek hi bhashaa ke andar anuwaad hota he or dwibhashi kosh main do bhashaaon ke madhya
 This translation takes place on the dimension of language rather than text, affecting two levels of language analysis
 ve do str - shabd or shabd shrunkhla hai
 Similarly, translation-trade is also taken for the development of a language
 jab kisi bhashaa ko aise vyavhaar-kshetron main kaam karne kaa avasar miltaa he, jinamein pehle uskaa prayog nahin hota tha, tab use vishaywastu or abhivyakti paddati donon hi drushtiyon se viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 For this, various types of literature from other languages are translated into it
 falswaroop, vishaywastu kii paridhi ke vistaar ke saath-saath bhashaa ke abhivyakti-kosh kaa kshetra bhi vistrut hota he
 Many new words are formed, sometimes the prevailing words get new meaning, new synergies start to develop, hybrid-vocabulary is used, and due to the characteristic of the context of language use, a new distinction of language overall gets up
 aadhunik prashasnic hindi tathaa patrakarita hindi iske achche udhaaharan hai
 This process is called language planning and language development, which is part of the socio-economic development of the nation in its wider context
 is prakaar anuwaad ke madhyam se vikasshil bhashaa main aavashyak or mahatvapurn sahitya kaa pravesh hota he
 One can then say that translation in this form also contributes to national development
 apane vyapkatam rup main anuwaad bhashaa kii shakti main sanvardhan karata he, paathon kii vyakhya evam nirvachan main sahaayak he, bhashaa tathaa vichaar ke bich sambandh ko spasht karata he, gyaan kaa prasar karata he, samskruti kaa samvahak he, tathaa rashtron ke madhye paraspar avgaman or sadbhaav kii vruddhi main yogadan karata he
 In Goethe's words, translation is necessary and important, even if impossible
 anuwaad ke swaroop ke do ullekhneey paksh hai - samanvay or santulan
 The multidisciplinary dimension of translation theory is its coordinating aspect
 tadnusaar, yadhyapi anuwaad siddhanth kaa mul udgam he anuprayukt tulanaatmak pathaceketvigyaan, tathaapi use kuch anya shaastra bhi sparsh karte hai
 It is clear that the translation of 'comparative' is related to two languages, in which questions of equality and inequality of languages are present
 pathasanketavigyaan ke teenon paksh - arthvichaar, vaakyavichaar tathaa sandarbhamimasaa - anuwaad siddhanth ke liye praasangik hai
 In economics, there is a study of the relation between linguistic signs and linguistic reality
 sandarbhamimasaa ke antargat bhashaprayog kii sthiti ke sandarbh ke vibhinn ayaamon - vaktaa evam shrota kii saamaajik pahchaan, bhashaprayog kaa uddeshy tathaa sandesh ke prati vaktaa - shrota kii abhivritti, bhashaprayog kii bhautik paristhitiyon kii tathaa abhivyakti, madhyam aadi - kii mimasaa hoti he
 It is clear that the periphery of signology is wider than that of linguistics and broad communication such as translation work is suitable for the study of business
 anuwaad siddhanth ko sparsh karne vaale shastron main he sampreshan siddhanth jisaki manyataon ke anusaar anuwaad kaary ek sampreshan vyapaar he, tathaa tadnusaar us par ve sabhi baaten lagu hoti hai, jo sampreshan vyapaar kii prakruti main hai, jaise sampreshan kaa shatpratishat yathatath na hona, apurnataa, udriktata, aanshik kritrimata aadi
 From this, in place of word-per-word and meaning-per-meaning similarity in translation work, message-like similarity can also be justified
 sankriyaatmak drushti se ek paath yaa prokti anuwaad kaary kaa pravartan bindu hota he
 a text has its own structure, it can be tested by the concepts of linguistic co-operation and conceptual relevance
 iske atirikt ek paath ko bhashaprakayon kii akibhoot samshti ke rup main dekhte hue, usamen bhashaa-prayog shailion ke bhashaprakaryamulak vitaran ke vishay main adhik nishchit jaankaree praapt hoti hai
 Related to this is Sastra, Sociology and stylology, in which information about the distribution of styles of contextual linguistics along with the study of social dialects and applications is desirable for translation theory
 bhashaa se samandhit hone ke kaaran tarkshastra tathaa bhashadarshan bhi anuwaad siddhanth ko pusht karte hai
 According to logic, Satyamulya's examination of the translated text is the basis for purifying the correctness of the translation
 bhashadarshan main hone vaale arth sambandhi chintan se anuwaad kaary main arth ke antaran yaa uski punrariti se sambandhit samasyaon ko jaanane main sahaayta milti he
 Wittgenstein's belief is the 'use' of the word in the language
 anuwaad siddhanth ke liye is kaaran se vishesh praasangik he ki paath hi anuwaad kaary kii ikai he, jiskaa safal arthbodh anuwaad kii pehali aavashyaktaa he
 Thus, searching for the origin of meaning, linguistic meaning and linguistic position are essential parts of translation theory in the speech of the speaker
 arth ke antaran main jahaan uparyukt manyataon kii ek bhoomika he, vahaan arthgat dwibhashik samanta ke nirdhaaran main ghatakeey vishleshan kii paddati kii vishesh upyogita sweekaar kii gai he
 It is specially taken into consideration that where the nature of translation theory is formed from the relevant beliefs of various scriptures, translation theory itself is a special part of those scriptures
 anuwaad siddhanth kaa 'saamaanya' paksh bhi he or vishisht paksh bhi, or yah iskaa santulansheel swaroop he - saamaanya or vishisht kaa santulan
 According to the definition of translation, it is said that translation is practically at the level of specific linguistics and therefore theoretically at the level of common language - a distinction of English language journalism from English to Hindi language in Hindi of journalism
 tadnusaar, yugapad rup se anuwaad siddhanth kaa ek saamaanya paksh bhi he or vishisht paksh bhi
 What we say at the level of general, in practice, cites the specific level of linguistics
 'yathasambhav adhiktam paath prakaaron ke liye ek upyukt tathaa saamaanya anuwaad pranali kaa nirdhaaran' ye anuwaad ke kshetra sambandhit ek vichaarneey prashn mana jaataa he
 In relation to the determination of the system one has to consider the nature of the translation process, the different types of translation, the formulas for translation and the format for determining instructions for translation of different categories of texts, etc
 anuwaad kaa mukhya uddeshy, anuwaad kii ikai, anuwaad kaa kala-kaushal-vigyaan kaa swaroop, anuwaad kaary kii seemayen, aadi kuch anya vishay hai, jin par vichaar apekshit hota he
 The main language of translation work is the original language text
 isaki sanrachana, iskaa prakaar, bhashaprakarya praaroop ke anusaar mulpath kaa swaroop nirdhaaran, aadi ke saath shabdaarth-vyavastha evam vyakaranik sanrachana ke vishleshnatmak bodhan ke vibhinn praaroop, unki shaktiyon or simaaon kaa akalan, aadi ke sambandh main saiddhanthik charchaa tathaa inke sankriyaatmak dhaanche kaa nirdhaaran, iske antargat aane vaale mukhya bindu hai
 Some minor points are also discussed under the translation principle - which system should be adopted for translation of metaphors, proper nouns, terminology, initials, geographical names, trade names, names of business establishments, cultural words, etc
 ; What should be the form of translation system for literary works, scientific and technological writing, publicity literature, etc
 isi se sambandhit ek mahatvapurn bindu he, anuwaad kii vibhinn yuktiyaan - lipyantaran, shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad, shabdanugami anuwaad, aagat anuwaad, vyakhya, vistaran, sankshepan, saanskrithik paryaay, swabhaasheekaran aadi
 Ultimately, only one person does the work of translation
 ekaaki anuwaad main to anuvadak akelaa hota hi he, sahyogaatmak anuwaad main bhi, antim avadhi main, sampaadan kaa kaary anuvadak ko akele karnaa hota he
 Therefore, many responsibilities are attached to the translator and there are many expectations from him in the successful execution of the work
 bhashaa gyaan, vishay gyaan, abhivyakti kaushal, vyaktigat gun aadi kii drushti se anuvadak se hone vaali apekshaaon par vichaar karnaa hota he
 Translation education and translation review are two other important points
 anuwaad kii shiksha bhashaa-adhigam ke, vishesh rup se anya bhashaa adhigam ke, saadhan ke rup main di ja sakati he 
 In this, translation is subject to teaching, language-teaching and is planned in an intermediate short-term course, in which the steps and goals of teaching are clear and definite
 isamen shikshaarthi kaa lakshya bhashaa siikhnaa he, anuwaad karnaa nahin
 In the second phase of education, translation is practiced to learn translation as a craft or skill whose advanced stage is specified in the terminology of 'translation is art'
 is sthiti main jo bhashaa anuvadak kii apni nahin, uske adhigam ko bhi aanushangik rup main pusht karata jaataa he
 As practice material, lessons have to be followed according to the variety of text types and the amount of difficulty
 yadi ek sajaateey / vijaateey, swedashi yaa videshi bhashaa ko seekhney kii yojana main usase yaa usamen anuwaad karne kii kshamta ko viksit karnaa ek uddeshy ho to anuwaad-shikshan ke donon sopanon - sadhanparak tathaa sadhyaparak – ko anustarit rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Translation review is a part of the translation theory, which is behaved in a relaxed manner, even by a general reader of translated works, but who have a sufficiently clear theoretical background
 siddhantapusht anuwaad samiksha ek gyanatmak vyapaar he
 It reviews one or more translations of an original text, and the translation is evaluated by comparison of the original or by different comparisons of different translations of the original
 iske teen sopan hai - mulbhasha paath tathaa lakshyabhasha paath kaa vishleshan, donon kii tulana, or ant main lakshyabhashagat vishuddhta, upyuktata or swaabhaaviktaa kii drushti se anuwaad kaa moolyankan
 Various testing techniques are used to test the success of the translation on the step of the evaluation
 anuwaad ko kala or vigyaan donon hi roopon main swikaarne kii maansikta isi kaaran pallavit hui he ki sansarbhar kii bhashaaon ke parsparik anuwaad kii koshish anuwaad kii anek shaileyon or pravidhiyon kii ore ishaara karti hai
 One of the problems of translation is that a translation should be presented on the basis of literary genre
 yadi kisi naatak kaa naatak ke rup main hi anuwaad kiya jaae to aise anuwaadon main anuvadak kii apni sarjanaatmak pratibha kaa vaishishty bhi apekshit hota he
 a basis of translation is also dependent on the translation being prose or verse
 aisa paaya jaataa he ki adhikanshtah gadhy kaa anuwaad gadhy main athwa padya main hi upasthit ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi yah kram badla hua najar aata he
 The poetry of many prose works is found, while the translations of many poems are also available
 anuwaadon ko vishay ke aadhaar par bhi vargeekrut kiya jaataa he or kai staron par anuwaad kii prakruti ke anuroop use mul-kendrit or mulmukt do virgon main bhi baanta gaya he
 Among the meaningful and prevalent practices of translation, which have been mentioned by the translation scientists, the most acceptance of concordance, paraphrasing, paraphrasing, paraphrasing, interpreting, transliteration and conversion has been accepted
 strotbhasha ke prayek shabd kaa lakshyabhasha ke prayek shabd main yathavat anuvaadan ko shabdanuwaad kehete hai
 Verbatism based on 'maिकािकाika sthana maक्षिकाika' is actually the most inferior category of translation
 prayek bhashaa kii prakruti anya bhashaa se bhinn hoti he or har bhashaa main shabd ke anekanek arth vidyaman rahete hai
 That is why every phrase of the original language cannot be translated into the target language in the same way
 kai baar aise shabdanuvaadon ke kaaran badi haasyaaspad sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 Translations made from Sanskrit to Hindi are sometimes tolerated due to the similarity of nature, but in the translation from European family languages, defects of meaning and hierarchy are commonly seen
 vastav main yadi strot or lakshyabhasha main arth, prayog, vaakya-vinyas or style kii samanta ho, tabhi shabdanuwaad sahi hota he, anyathaa yantrawat kiye gaye shabdanuwaad abodhgamy, haasyaaspad evam kritrim ho jate hai
 In such translators, the translation focuses its attention on the content or expression of the original language, regardless of the source language's words, phrase and syntax
 aise anuwaadon main strotbhasha kii bhav-saamagree ko upasthit karnaa hi anuvadak kaa lakshya hota he
 In the process of paraphrasing, sometimes the original splendor of the original form comes, but sometimes readers complain that the translator has presented the sense content according to the nature of the target language, without understanding the language of the original language
 jab pathak kisi rachana ko rachanaakaar ke abhivyakti-kaushal kii dashshti se padhanaa chahta he, to bhavanuaad uski lakshyasiddhi main sahaayak nahin hota
 In Sanskrit plays, there are frequent experiments that the Sanskrit shadow of the Prakrit language used by their women and servants, maids, etc
, also exists in the drama
 aise hi prayogon se chhayanuwaad kaa udbhav hua he
 Under the method of translation, the translator does not follow only the original words as in concordance, and not only follows the expressions, but also presents the subject in the target language in its shadow, completely bound to the original language
 is anuwaad main mulbhasha kii saamagree kaa sankshipt or atisankshipt anuwaad lakshyabhasha main kiya jaataa he
 This method is helpful in presenting translations of long speeches and debates
 aise anuwaadon main mulbhasha kii saamagree kaa lakshyabhasha main vyakhya sahit anuwaad upasthit kiya jaataa he
 In this, the translator interprets the contents of the original language with the requisite evidence and examples etc
, according to his study and approach
 lokmaanya tilak ne ’gita‘ kaa anuwaad is style main kiya he
 Many Sanskrit commentators and Hindi commentators have followed the genre of lectures
 swabhaavatah vyakhyanuwaad athwa bhashyanuwaad mul se bahut bada ho jaataa he or kai staron par to ekadam moulik ban jaataa he
 Where translation works in the role of interpreter, he is only able to translate
 do duurastha deshon ke bhinn bhashaa-bhashi jab aapas main baaten karte hai, to unke bich dubhashiya samvaad kaa madhyam banataa he
 On such occasions, the translation breaks the boundaries of words and expressions, based on the translator's ability to translate
 uske paas itnaa samay nahin hota he ki shabd ke sahi bhashaayi paryaay ke bare main soche athwa koshon kii sahaayta le sake
 Sometimes, due to the misinterpretation of such interpreters, a situation of tension is also created in two countries
 ashyanuwaad hi ab bhashaantaran ke rup main charchit he
 In this context of translation, the translator does not only translate words and expressions from the original language to the target language, but completely transforms the original composition according to his talent and convenience
 wiliam shakespeare ke prasiddh naatak 'marchent of venice' kaa anuwaad bharatendu harishchandr ne 'durlabh bandhu' arthath 'vanspur kaa mahajan' naam se kiya he jo roopantaran ke anuwaad kaa anyatam udhaaharan he
 Names like Antonio, Basolio, Porschea, Shylock of the original play have been adapted by Bharatendu like Anant, Basant, Purshree, Shailaksha respectively
 aise roopantaran main anuwaad kii moulikta sabase adhik ubharkar saamne aati he
 These interpretations of the translator suggest that many styles and methods of translation have been adopted in languages across the world, but if the translator meticulously touches the soul of the word and emotion, it is the ideal to translate the target language in accordance with the nature of the native language
 Will translate
 isiilie shreshth anuvadak ko aisa kushal chikitsak kaha jaataa he, jo bottle main rakhi dawa ko apni syringe ke dwaara rogi ke sharir main yathaavat pahunchaa detaa he
 Translation theory is not an independent, independent, theory in itself, nor is it a 'science' in the sense in which mathematics, philology, sociology, etc
 are
 isaki aisi koi vishisht adhyayan saamagree tathaa adhyayan pranali bhi nahin, jo anya shastron kii adhyayan saamagree tathaa pranali se is rup main bhinn ho ki, iskaa multah swatantra vyaktitv ban sake
 In fact, it is a body of cognitive information related to various issues of translation, which helps in understanding translation as a process, a conclusion, and a relation
 iske liye sadyah 'anuwaad vidya, 'anuwaad vigyaan', or 'anuvaadiki' shabd bhi prachlit hai
 Translation is a process related to linguistics, which has a definite culmination and as a result of which there is a relation of equality in terms of origin and 'value'
 is prakaar prakriya, nishpatti, or sambandh kii sanghatit ikai ke rup main anuwaad sambandhi saamaanya prakruti kii jaankaree hi anuwaad siddhanth he, jo multah ekanvit na hote hue bhi sangrahaniya, rochak, gyanavardhak, tathaa ek seemaa tak vaastavik anuwaad kaary ke liye upadey he
 In its present stage of development, it has become a multi-disciplinary discipline
 jiskaa gyaan praapt karnaa swayamev ek lakshya he tathaa jo jigyaasu pathak ke liye bauddhik santosh kaa strot he
 While assessing the usefulness of translation theory in translation work, the occasional fact is taken into account that in the present day translation has become an organized profession, in which trainees are more motivated by occupational-social need than by personal interest
 vishesh rup se aise logon ke liye tathaa saamaanya rup se ruchishil anuvaadakon ke liye anuwaad kaary main dakshata viksit karne main anuwaad siddhanth ke yogadan ko nirupit kiya jaataa he 
 The theoretical justification of this contribution is also from the point of view that translation work is secondary, because it is creative
 ise 'sarjanaatmak-samikshatmak' bhi kaha jaataa he 
 In order to clarify and confirm the creativeness, the critical comments that are made in the translator are derived from the knowledge of translation theory
 anuwaad kii vishuddhta kii nishpatti main siddhanth gyaan kaa yogadan rahata he 
 Also, knowledge of the translation process can help him work more carefully in synonym selection
 isse adhik mahatvaparn baat maani jaati he ki vah moorkhtapurna trutiyaan karne se batch saktaa he 
 The knowledge of translation theory also helps the translator in developing the watchful vision required so that no part of the text, linguistic, thematic, and cultural significance is left out of translation
 isi prashn ko duusare chor se bhi dekha jaataa he 
 It is said that those who can write original, they write, those who cannot write translate, and those who cannot translate, they discuss about translation
 vastutah in teenon main paripurakta he - ye teenon kuch bhinn-bhinn hai – tathaapi yah mana jaataa he ki anuwaad vishyak charchaa ko adhik pramanik tathaa vishad banane main anuwaad siddhanth ke vidhyaarthee ko anuwaad kaary sambandhi anubhav sahaayak hota he 
 It is such that literature reviewers familiar at the level of prolific experience can present their critical responses more convincingly
 anuwaad siddhanth ke vartmaan swaroop ko dekhte hue iske vikaas kon vihang-drishy se do charnon main vibhakt karke dekha jaataa he : The era before the development of modern linguistics, especially applied linguistics, the early twentieth century; iske pashchaat kaa yug-beesvin sadi uttarardh 
 It is commonly said that the subject of controversy in different epochs of doctrine development and in the same different streams, whether the translation was verbatim or semantic, though the 'language' of the controversy kept changing
 isapurv pratham shatabdi main roman yug se armbh hota he, jab horence tathaa siciro ne shabdanugami tathaa arthanugami anuwaad main antar spasht kiya tathaa saahitiyik rachanaaon ke liye arthanugami anuwaad ko pradhanta di 
 Cicero described a good translator as an interpreter and expert in learning
 roman yug ke pashchaat, jisamen saahitiyik anuwaadon kii pradhanta thi, duusari shaktishaalee dhara bible anuwaad kii he 
 Saint Jerome also prioritized the meaning of meaning in the translation of the Bible and supported the use of the language of day-to-day behavior in translation
 isamen vichaar yah tha ki, bible kaa sandesh jansadharan paryant pahunch jaae or iske nimitt jansadharan ke liye bodhgamy bhashaa kaa prayog kiya jaae, jisamen swabhaavatah arthanugami drushtikon ko pradhanta mili 
 John Wycliffe and William Tindl supported this trend
 bodhgamy tathaa sundar bhashaa main, tathaa style evam arth ke madhya samanjasy kii raksha karte hue, bible ke anuwaad kii pravriti ko protsaahan mila, jisamen martin luther kaa yogadan ullekhneey rahaa
 The third section has been related to the contribution of translation in education
 quitillian ne anuwaad tathaa sambhaashi vyaakhyaatmak shabdaantaran kii upyogita ko lekhan abhyaas tathaa bhaashan-dakshata viksit karne ke sandarbh main dekha
 Which spread more in medieval Europe
 isse sthaneey bhashaaon kaa str upar uthaa tathaa unki abhivyakti samarthy main vruddhi bhi hui 
 The trend of translation from rich and developed languages to developing languages is a major trend of the literary world of medieval Europe, which is called the trend of the upward dimension and the tendency of the translation of the level of dimension between the equally developed or underdeveloped languages prevalent at the same time
 Viewed as
 madhyakaalin europe ke aarmabhik siddhantakaaron main french vidwaan i0 dolet ne 1540 main prakashit nibandh main anuwaad ke paanch vidhi-nishedh prastaavit kiye : The translator has complete knowledge of the language of the original author, but he can remove the ambiguity and ambiguity of the original language if he wishes
 anuvadak kaa mulbhasha or lakshyabhasha kaa purna gyaan ho; Translators avoid word-per-word translation; anuvadak dainandin ke vyavhaar kii bhashaa kaa prayog kare; The translator should do such wordings and terminology so that proper effect is concluded
 george chapman ne bhi isi prakaar 'elliod' ke sandarbh main anuwaad ke teen sutara prastaavit kiye : Word-per-word translation should be avoided; mul kii bhaavana paryant pahunchne kaa prayaas kiya jaae; The translation should not be too relaxed due to the touch of scholarship
 europe ke punarjagran yug main anuwaad kii dhara ek gaun pravriti rahi 
 The translators of this era see the tendency to protect the interest of the reader with the primacy of meaning
 holland ke anuwaad main mulpath ke arth main parivartan-parivardhan dwaara anudit paath ke sanskaar kii jhalak dikhti he 
 In the seventeenth century in England, Sir John Denham opposed the tendency to be wordy in the translation of the poem and asserted the central element of the original text and reintroduced it into the target language; He came to be called 'anusarajan'
 is avidh main jaan dryden ne mahatvaparn vichaar prakat kiye
 He defined three categories of translation work: shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad ; Meaningful translation, anukaran 
 According to Dryden, the route between and is acceptable
 unke anusaar kavita ke anuwaad main anuvadak ko donon bhashaaon par adhikaar ho, use mul lekhak ke saahitiyik gunon or uski 'bhaavana' kaa gyaan ho, tathaa vah apane samay ke saahitiyik aadarshon kaa paalan kare
 Alexander Pope also expressed similar views as Dideon
 atharahavin shatabdi main anuwaad kii atimulanishthata tathaa athiswatantrata ke vivaad se ek sopan aage badhkar ek samasya thi ki apane samakaleen pathak ke prati anuvadak kaa kartavya 
 Due to excessive inclination towards the reader, the form of the translated text used to be far away from the original text
 is par dow
 samuel janson ne kaha ki, anuwaad main mulpath kii apeksha parivardhan ke kaaran utpann parishkruti kaa swaagat kiya ja saktaa he, parantu mulpath kii haani na ho ye dhyaan dena chaiye
 He also said that just as the writer writes for his contemporary reader, the translator also translates for his contemporary reader
 dow
 janson kii sammati main anuwaad kii mulanishthata tathaa pathakdharmita main santulan miltaa he 
 He called the translator such a painter or follower who, despite being loyal to the original, takes care of the interests of the intended audience
 eleggender frager titaler jinaki pustak principles aaf transleshan anuwaad siddhanth par pehali vyavasthit pustak maani jaati he 
 Tittler proposed three translation formulas: anuwaad main mul rachana ke bhav kaa puraa anurakshan ho; The style of translation should be consistent with the original; anuwaad main mul vaali subodhta ho
 It is said by Tittler that, in translation, the feeling of the original should be so thoroughly solicited that after reading it, the readers get as intense feeling as the original readers had; This is the principle of efficacy
 unnisvin shatabdi main romantic tathaa uttar-romantic yugon main anuwaad chintan par tatkaaleen kavychintan kaa prabhaav dikhaai detaa he 
 A
W
 Schlegel called all kinds of oral and written language practice translation, and emphasized on preserving the formation of the original
 is yug main ek ore to anuvadak ko sarjanaatmak lekhak ke tulya samajhane kii pravriti dikhaai detii he, to duusari ore anuwaad ko shabdanugami banane par bal dene kii baat kahi gai 
 Some scholars have discussed translation as having a different dialect that matches the above beliefs
 victorian dhara ke anuvadak is baat ke liye prayatnsheel rahe ki desh or kaal kii duuri ko anuwaad main surakshit rakhaa jaae – videshi bhashaaon kii pracheen rachanaaon ke anuwaad main videshiyata or pracheenta kii haani na ho - jiske falswaroop shabdanugami anuwaad kii pravriti ko protsaahan mila 
 Longfellow was its supporter
 parantu umr khaiyam kii rubaayiyon ke anuvadak fitjerald ke vichaar iske vipareet the 
 He was a supporter of the belief that instead of bringing the reader of the translation closer to the original language text, the cultural features of the original language text should be presented in the target language in such a way that it appears to be the live property of the target language, and in the process the native language The increased distance from translation should be ignored
 beesvin sadi ke purvardh main do-teen anuwaad chintak ullekhneey hai 
 Kroche and Velary have expressed doubts in the success of the translation, particularly the success of the translation of the poem
 mathew ornald ne homer kii kritiyon ke anuwaad main saral, pratyaksh or udaatt style ko apnaane par bal diya
 Thus in the period before the rise of modern linguistics, translation thinking often revolved around two opposing beliefs
 wo do manyataayen is prakaar hai - The translation should be verbose or free anuwaad apni aantarik prakruti kii drushti se asambhav he, parantu saamaajik drushti se nitant aavashyak 
 Overall the balance of phenomenological and discriminatory views is seen in the translation thought of this period - from the perspective of translation, it means a form of translation theory which is of general order, and in the differentiated view, it is necessary in the system of translation based on the natural variation of the texts
 Discussion of change has its implications
 vidwaanon ne is avadhi main amoort chintan to kiya parantu ve anuwaad pranali kaa sodaaharan pallavan nahin kar paae 
 With the insightful understanding of the text, they moved towards the goal of analytical comprehension, but there was no definite theory behind it
 aise chintakon main anuvaadakon ke atirikt sahityakar tathaa sahitya-sameekshak hi adhik the, bhashavigyaani nahin 
 In addition, they did not seem to be familiar with each other's thoughts

 During this period, the attention of translators and linguists familiar with linguistics attracted attention to translation theory
 sanrachanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaa vikaas, arthvigyaan kii pragati, sampreshan siddhanth tathaa bhashavigyaan kaa samanvay, tathaa anuprayukt bhashavigyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon - samajabhashavigyaan, shailivigyaan, manobhashavigyaan, prokti vishleshan - kaa vikaas, tathaa sanketvigyaan, visheshtah paath sanketavigyaan, kaa udai aisi ghatnaayen maani jaati hai, jo anuwaad siddhanth ko pusht tathaa viksit karne kii drushti se mahatvapurn maani jaati rahi
 a scholar Eugen Nida is also considered in the anglo-american stream
 unhone bible-anuwaad ke anubhav ke aadhaar par anuwaad siddhanth or vyavhaar par apane vichaar granthon ke rup main prakat kiye 
 In these, a detailed, detailed and logical form of translation theory can be seen

 He gave a description of the multidimensional adjustments between the two languages related to the status of translation
 anya vidvan catford hai, jinke anuwaad siddhanth main sanrachanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke anuprayog kaa udhaaharan miltaa he 
 He determined the format of translation on a purely linguistic basis, gave a linguistic description of translation-transitions, and considered the limits of translation
 tisare prabhaavshaalee vidvan peter neumark hai jinhone sugathit or ghanishtha style main anuwaad siddhanth kaa tarksangat tathaa gahan vivechan prastut karne kaa prayaas kiya 
 They clarify their ideas with appropriate examples
 unhone naida ke vipareet, paath prarupabhed ke anusaar vishisht anuwaad pranali kii manyata prastut kii 
 His translation is a contribution to the theory that the concept of translation-centric and communication-centric system
 unhone paath vishleshan, sandeshaantaran tathaa lakshyabhasha main abhivyakti kii sthitiyon main sambandhit anek anuwaad sutara prastut kiye; yah bhi inkaa ek ullekhneey vaishishty mana jaataa he

 The IETF adopts some of the proposals published as RFC as Internet Standards
 RFC swaroop kii sthapana 1969 main praathmik ARPANET pariyojna ke ansh ke rup main hui
 Today it is also the official publishing medium for the Internet Engineering Task Force, the Internet Architecture Board and - to a lesser extent - the global community of computer network researchers in general

 RFC sawaal khulaa chodta he or ek kam aupchaarik style main likhaa hota he
 This less formal style is nowadays the common form of Internet draft documents, a pre-emptive stage before being approved as an RFC
 disambar 1969 main, shodhakartaaon ne nae prachaalit ARPANET ke zarie nae RFC kaa vitaran shuru kiya
 RFC 1, titled "host Software", was written by Steve Crocker of the University of California, Los Angeles and published on April 7, 1969
 haalanki ise steve crocker ne likhaa, par RFC, steve crocker, steve kair or jeff rulifasan ke bich ek praarambhik kaary dal kii charchaa se ubhara

 The RFC Editor assigns a unique serial number to each RFC
 jab ek baar RFC ke liye ek sankhya niyat or prakashit kiya jaataa he, to RFC ko kabhi nirast yaa sanshodhit nahin kiya jaataa; agar dastauez main sanshodhan kii aavashyaktaa ho, to lekhak sanshodhit dastauez prakashit karte hai
 Therefore, some rfcs replace others; Such superseded rfcs are called deprecated, obsolete, or undeclared
 aanukramik RFC ek saath, internet maanakon or prathaon ke vikaas ke satat aitihaasik record rachate hai
 Note that the term RFC is not exclusive to this series

 aam taur par har saal, saamanytah april fools de ke avasar par, kam se kam ek joke prakashit hota he
 Most rfcs use common terms such as "MUST" and "NOT RECOMMENDED", as augmented backus-now form metals, and a simple set of simple text-based terms so that rfcs are consistent and easily understood
 RFC or RFC prakriya ke bare main adhik jaankaree ke liye, RFC 2026, "internet maanak prakriya, sanshodhan 3" dekhen
 The official source of RFC on the World Wide Web is RFC Editor
 lagbhag koi bhi vyaktigat, prakashit RFC, jaise RFC 5000 ko nimna udhaaharan ke samaan URL ke zarie punahprapt kar sakate hai:http: / / www
rfc-editor
org / rfc / rfc5000
txt Each RFC is presented and published as plain ASCII text, but may be available in other formats
 haalanki, 2008 ke anusaar nischitsanskaran kisi standard-trek vinirdesan kaa, ASCII sanskaran he
 For easy access to rfc's metadata, including abstracts, keywords, authors, publication date, corrigendum, status, and especially subsequent updates, the RFC Editor site also offers a search format with many features
 punarnirdesan kuch kushal maanakon ko sthapit karata he, udhaaharan:http: / / purl
net / net / rfc / 5000 Not all rfcs are standard
 prayek RFC ko sthiti ke sambandh main internet maanakeekaran prakriya ke antargat ek padnaam saunpa jaataa he
 This situation is one of the following: informative, experimental, best current practice, standard-track, or historical
 Standard-track documents are further divided into proposed standard, draft standard and Internet standard documents
 shabd aitihaasik, padaavnat standard-trek dastavejon yaa aprachlit RFC par lagu kiya jaataa he, jo standard-trek kii sthapana se pehle prakashit kiye gaye the
 Only the IETF, denoted by the Internet Engineering Steering Group, can approve the standard-track RFC
 prayek RFC sthir he; agar dastauez badla jaataa he, to ise dubaara prastut kiya jaataa he or ise ek nai RFC sankhya saunpi jaati he
 If an RFC becomes the Internet standard, an STD number is assigned to it, but its RFC number remains intact; However, when the Internet standard is updated, its number remains the same and refers only to a different RFC or RFC set
 maan len ki ek internet maanak, STD n kisi nishchit samay par RFC x or y ho, lekin baad main vahi maanak bajaay unke RFC z main adhyatan ho saktaa he
 For example, in 2007 the RFC 3700 Internet Standard - STD 1 was - in May 2008 it was replaced with the RFC 5000, so the RFC 3700 became historic, the RFC 5000 Internet Standard and as of May 2008 STD 1 is RFC 5000
 When STD 1 Will be updated again, then it will only refer to a new RFC that has completed the standard track, but will still be STD 1
 uttam maujuuda vyavhaar isi tarah kaam karte hai; BCP n kisi vishisht RFC yaa RFC ke set ko sanderbhit karata he, lekin jo RFC yaa RFC ke set, samay ke saath badal sakate hai
 The definitive list of Internet standards is itself an Internet standard, STD 1: Internet Official Protocol Standard
 ek suchanaatmak RFC, pehali april ke joke se lekar RFC 1591 jaise vyapak rup se pahachaane jane vaale aavashyak RFC jaise swaamitv protocol tak kuch bhi ho sakate hai
 Some informational rfcs may be in the form of sub-series for your information
 jahaan aaj shaayad hi kabhi jode jate hon, kuch puraane FYI abhi bhi dilachasp hai, udhaaharan ke liye, FYI 18, internet upyogkartaaon kii shabdaawalee 
 FYI 17, da tao of IETF ab RFC 4677 he, jo 2006 main prakashit hua
 An experimental RFC can be an IETF document or an individual presentation for an RFC editor
 siddhant rup main yah vastav main praayogic he; vyavhaar main kuch dastavezon ko standard trek par badhaava nahin diya jaataa he, kyonki prakriyaagat vivaranon ke liye koi swayamsevak maujuud nahin hai
 The Best Current Practices sub-series store administrative documents and other texts that are considered official rules and are not only informative, but that do not affect over the wire data
 The boundary between Standard Track and BCP is often unclear
 yadi koi dastauez keval internet maanak prakriya ko prabhavit karata he, jaise ki BCP 9, yaa IETF prashasan, to vah nishchit rup se BCP he
 If it only defined the rules and regulations for Internet Assigned Numbers Authority registries, it would be no more explicit; Most of these documents are BCP, but some are also on standard track
 BCP shrinkhalaa, internet maanakon kaa vyavhaar kaise karen, ke liye takneekee sifaarishon ko bhi aavruth karti hai; udhaaharan ke liye Dos hamalon ko adhik mushkil banane ke liye sorce filtering ke istemaal kii sifarish he BCP 38
 The historical RFC is one that has been rendered obsolete by the new version, which documents protocols that are not considered interesting in the current Internet, or that have been removed from the standard track for other reasons
 kuch aprachlit RFC aitihaasik rup main vargeekrut nahin kiye gaye hai, kyonki internet maanak prakriya aam taur par standard trek RFC se nichle str ke anya RFC main niamak sandarbhon ko anumat nahin karti he
 Also, very few people are interested in going through the requisite procedural details to classify rfcs as historical and to regulatoryly update all rfcs on that basis
 sthiti agyaat kaa istemaal kuch bahut puraane RFC ke liye kiya jaataa he, jahaan yah spasht nahin hota ki aaj prakashit kiye jane par dastavej kii sthiti kya hogi
 Some of these rfcs will not be published today; Early rfcs were often like this: a simple request for comment, not for the purpose of specifying protocols, administrative procedures, or anything else, for which the RFC series is used today

 'chol' shabd kii vyutpatti vibhinn prakaar se kii jaati rahi he
 Colonel Jerino associated the word Chola with the Sanskrit "kal" and "kol" and considered it an indicator of the Krishnavarna Arya community of South India
 chol shabd ko sanskrit "chor" tathaa tamil "cholam" se bhi sambhddha kiya gaya he kintu inamen se koi mat thik nahin he
 From the earliest times, the use of the word Chola has been used for subjects and territories ruled by the dynasty of the same name
 sangamayugin manimeclai main cholon ko suryavanshi kaha he
 Shambian is also among the many nicknames of the Cholas

 Many local dynasties of the 12th century describe themselves as Kashyapa Gotriya, originating from Karikal
 cholon ke ullekh atyant pracheen kaal se hi praapt hone lagate hai
 Katyayana mentions Chodas

 But he probably influenced South Indian history for the first time in the Sangam era itself

 Nevertheless, the Chola dynasty tradition was not abolished as the Cholas continued to rule under the Pallavas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas in Rayandu region

 After this, Rajaraja I, furthering the spread of the Chola dynasty, reinstated the dignity of his dynasty by his many victories
 usne sarvapratham pashchimi gangon ko parajeet kar unka pradesh chin liya
 Subsequently, his long unprovoked war with the Western Chalukyas began
 iske vipareet rajraj ko sudur dakshin main aashaatheet safalataa mili
 He defeated the King of Kerala
 pandyon ko parajeet kar madura or kurg main sthit udgai adhikrut kar liya
 Not only this, Rajaraja attacked Sinhala and merged his northern territories into his kingdom
 rajraj ne purvi chalukyon par akraman kar vengi ko jeet liya
 But after this, on the Eastern Chalukya throne, he distinguished Shaktivarman and married his daughter Kundava to Vimaladitya, the younger brother of Shaktivirman
 is samay kaling ke gang raja bhi vengi par drushti gadaaye the, rajraj ne unhen bhi parajeet kiya
 After Rajaraja, his son Rajendra i ascended the throne
 rajendra pratham bhi atyant shaktishaalee samrat the
 Rajendra won Chera, Pandya and Sinhala and merged them into his kingdom
 unhone pashchimi chalukyon ko kai yudhon main parajeet kiya, unki rajdhani ko dhwast kiya kintu unpar purna vijay na praapt kar sake
 Rajendra's two other military operations are extremely notable
 unka pratham sainik abhiyaan purvi samudratat se kaling, urisa, dakshin koshal aadi ke raajaaon ko parajeet karata hua bengal ke viruddh hua
 He defeated the three younger kings of West and South Bengal as well as the powerful Pala King Mahipal

 It is also known that the defeated kings had to carry this water at their ends
 kintu yah maatr akraman tha, isse chol samrajya kii simaaon par koi asar nahin padaa
 Rajendra's second important invasion was against the Shailendra rule of Malayadweep, Java and Sumatra
 yah purna rup se nausainik akraman tha
 The Shailendra emperors were friendly to Rajaraja but the reason for their enmity with Rajendra is unknown
 rajendra ko isamen safalataa mili
 Like Rajraj, Rajendra also sent an ambassador to China
 rajaadhiraj pratham rajendra kaa uttaradhikari tha
 Most of his time was spent in suppressing rebellions

 He died in the battle of Koppam with his Chalukya Someshwar

 He won this war against the Chalukyas
 chalukyon ke saath yuddh dirghakaalik tha
 Rajendra ii's successor, Veer Rajendra, conquered many wars and often ruled the entire Chola empire
 adhirajendra vir rajendra kaa uttaradhikari tha kintu kuch maheenon ke shashan ke baad kulottung pratham ne usase chol rajyashri chin lee
 Kulottung was the son of the first Eastern Chalukya king, Rajaraja

 Kulottangu i himself was married to the daughter of Rajendra II
 kulottung ne apane vipaksh evam adhirajendra ke paksh se hue samast vidrohon kaa daman karke apni sthiti sudrudh kar lee
 During his extended reign, he successfully faced the numerous invasions and rebellions of Chalukya Emperor Vikramaditya, the supporter and brother-in-law of Adhirajendra
 sinhal phir bhi swatantra ho hi gaya
 Yuvraj Vikram Chola's efforts merged with Kalinga in the southern state of Kulottung
 kulottung ne apane antim dinon tak sinhal ke atirikt praaia: sampurna chol samrajya tathaa dakshini kaling pradesh par shashan kiya
 He also sent an ambassador to China
 vikram chol kulottung kaa uttaradhikari hua
 In about 1118, Vikramaditya VI took away from the Vengi Cholas

 Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister of India and a central figure in Indian politics before and after independence

 He is considered the architect of the modern Indian nation-state - a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic
 kashmiri pandit samudaay ke saath unke mul kii vajah se ve pandit nehru bhi bulaayen jate the, jabaki bhartiya bachche unhen chachaa nehru ke rup main jaanate hai
 Nehru was elected by the Congress to hold the post of the first Prime Minister of independent India, although the question of leadership was settled long back in 1941, when Gandhiji acknowledged Nehru as his political heir and successor
 pradhanmantri ke rup main, ve bharat ke sapane ko saakaar karne ke liye chal pade

 Despite political troubles in his last years and the failure of his leadership in the 1962 chinese-india War, he remained popular among the people of India
 bharat main, unka janmdin bal diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa hai
 Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad, British India
 unke pita, motilal nehru, ek dhani barrister jo kashmiri pandit samudaay se the, swatantrata sangram ke dauraan bhartiya rashtriya congress ke do baar adhyaksh chune gaye
 His mother Swarooprani Thusu, from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife and the first wife died during childbirth
 jawaharlal teen bacchon main se sabase bade the, jinamein baaki do ladkiyaan thi
 The elder sister, Vijaya Lakshmi, later became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly
 sabase choti bahan, krishna hathising, ek ullekhneey lekhika bani or unhone apane parivaar-janon se sambandhit kai pustaken likhin
 Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in some of the best schools and universities in the world
 unhone apni schuli shiksha hero se or college kii shiksha trinity college, cambridge se puri kii thi
 He then completed his law degree from Cambridge University
 england main unhone saat saal vyateet kiye jisamen vahaan ke fabian samaajwaad or irish rashtrawaad ke liye ek tarksangat drushtikon viksit kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru returned to India in 1912 and started advocacy
 1916 main unki shaadi kamala nehru se hui
 Jawaharlal Nehru joined the Home Rule League in 1917
 raajnneeti main unki asli diksha do saal baad 1919 main hui jab ve mahatma gandhi ke sampark main aae
 At that time Mahatma Gandhi launched a campaign against the Rowlatt Act
 nehru, mahatma gandhi ke sakriy lekin shantipurna, savinay avagya andolan ke prati khaase aakarshith hue
 Nehru also adapted his family according to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi
 jawaharlal or motilal nehru ne pashchimi kapadon or mahangi sampatti kaa tyaag kar diya
 He now started wearing a Khadi kurta and Gandhi cap
 jawahar laal nehru ne 1920-1922 main asahyog andolan main sakriy hissaa liya or is dauraan pehali baar giraftaar kiye gaye
 He was released after a few months
 jawaharlal nehru 1924 main elahabaad nagar nigam ke adhyaksh chune gaye or unhone shahar ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ke rup main do varsh tak seva kii
 He resigned in 1926 citing lack of cooperation from the British authorities
 1926 se 1928 tak, jawahar laal nehru ne akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke mahasachiv ke rup main seva kii
 In 1928-29, the annual session of the Congress was held under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 us satr main jawaharlal nehru or subhash chandra bose ne puri raajnneetik swatantraaa kii maang kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki motilal nehru or anya netaaon ne british samrajya ke bheetar hi prabhutv sampann rajya kaa darja paane kii maang kaa samarthan kiya
 To resolve the issue, Gandhi took a middle ground and said that Britain would be given two years to grant the status of the state of India and if it did not, the Congress would launch a national struggle for complete political independence
 nehru or bose ne maang kii ki is samay ko kam kar ke ek saal kar diya jaae
 The British government did not respond to this
 disambar 1929 main, congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan lahore main yojit kiya gaya jisamen jawaharlal nehru congress party ke adhyaksh chune gaye
 During this session, a resolution was also passed demanding 'complete self-rule'
 26 janvari 1930 ko lahore main jawaharlal nehru ne swatantra bharat kaa jhanda fahraaya
 Gandhiji also called for the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930
 andolan khaasaa safal rahaa or isane british sarkaar ko pramukh raajnneetik sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 When the British Government promulgated the India Act 1935, the Congress Party decided to contest elections
 nehru chunaav ke baahar rahe lekin zoron ke saath party ke liye rashtravyapee abhiyaan chalaaya
 The Congress formed governments in almost every province and won the largest number of seats in the Central Assembly
 nehru congress ke adhyaksh pad ke liye 1936 or 1937 main chune gaye the
 He was also arrested during the Quit India Movement in 1942 and released in 1945
 1947 main bharat or pakistan kii aazaadee ke samay unhone angreji sarkaar ke saath hui vaartaon main mahatvapurn bhagidaari kii
 When India got independence in 1947, when the Congress voted for the future Prime Minister, Sardar Patel got the most votes
 uske baad sarvaadhik mat acharya kriplani ko mili the
 But at the behest of Gandhiji, Sardar Patel and Acharya Kripalani withdrew their names and Jawaharlal Nehru was made the Prime Minister
 1947 main ve swatantra bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri bane
 The British had liberated around 500 princely states together and the biggest challenge at that time was to bring them under one flag
 unhone bharat ke punargathan ke raste main ubhari har chunauti kaa samajhadaari purvak saamana kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru played an important role in the making of modern India
 unhone yojana ayog kaa gathan kiya, vigyaan or praudyogiki ke vikaas ko protsaahit kiya or teen lagaataar panchavarshiya yojanaon kaa shubharambh kiya
 Due to their policies, a new era of agriculture and industry started in the country
 nehru ne bharat kii videsh niti ke vikaas main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 Jawaharlal Nehru, together with Josip Burrows Tito and Abdul Gamal Nasir, created a non-aligned movement for the elimination of colonialism in Asia and Africa
 vah korian yuddh kaa ant karne, suez nahar vivaad sulajhane or congou samjhaute ko murtarup dene jaise anya antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan main madhyasth kii bhoomika main rahe
 He also contributed significantly behind the scenes in resolving many other explosive issues like West Berlin, Austria and Laos
 unhen varsh 1955 main bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya
 But Nehru could not improve India's relations with Pakistan and China
 pakistan ke saath ek samjhaute tak pahunchne main kashmir mudda or china ke saath mitrataa main seemaa vivaad raste ke pathar sabit hue
 Nehru also extended a hand of friendship towards China, but in 1962, China attacked by deception
 nehru ke liye yah ek bada jhatka tha or shaayad unki maut bhi isi kaaran hui
 On 27 May 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru suffered a heart attack in which he died
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki nehru ne anya netaaon kii tulana main bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut kam yogadan diya tha phir bhi gandhiji ne unhe bharat kaa pratham pradhanmantri bana diya
 For several decades after independence, the heirs of power in Indian democracy have run a monarchy in the country from time to time, revered individual worship in place of ideology and completely neglected the public interest while indulging in the aura of so-called popularity
 nehru ko mahatma gandhi ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke taur janaa jaataa he
 It is also alleged on Gandhi that he did the work of advancing Nehru in politics at the expense of many able leaders including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 jab aazaadee ke thik pehle congress adhyaksh banane kii baat thi or mana ja rahaa tha ki jo congress adhyaksh banegaa vahi aaazaad bharat kaa pehla pradhanmantri hoga tab bhi gandhi ne pradesh congress samitiyon kii siforeeshon ko andekha karte hue nehru ko hi adhyaksh banane kii disha main safaltaapurvak prayaas kiya
 This creates a general belief that Nehru must have not only done the work of advancing the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi but he must have tried his best to complete the tasks which Gandhi himself could not complete
 lekin sachai iske ulat he
 It was none other than Jayaprakash Narayan, who once worked as a team with Nehru, in the role of 1978 book 'gandhi Today'
 jepi ne nehru ke bare main kuch kaha he to uski vishwasaneeyata ko lekar koi andeh nahin hona chahie kyonki nehru se jepi kii najdiki bhi thi or mitrataa bhi
 Despite this, JP highlighted the shortcomings of the Nehru model
 april 2015 main yah bhi khulaasa hua ki swatantraaa ke baad nehru ne bees varshon tak ibi dwaara netaji ke sambandhiyon kii jasusi karaayi
 Away from all political controversies, Nehru was undoubtedly a good writer
 raajnneetik kshetra main lokmaanya tilak ke baad jam kar likhane vaale netaaon main ve alag se pahachaane jate hai
 The areas of both are different, but there is a considerable amount of consistency in the writing of both
 nehru ji swabhaav se hi swadhyaayi the
 He studied great texts
 sabhi rajnatik uttejnaaon ke baavjood ve swadhyay ke liye roj hi samay nikaal liya karte the
 As a result, the books composed by him also give a simple feeling of being the creation of a study-able person
 nehru ji ne vyavasthit rup se anek pustakon kii rachana kii he
 The solution to the extreme lack of time for writing in the busiest struggling days of political life was to make the long dull days of jail a creative one
 isliye unki adhikansh pustaken jail main hi likhi gayi hai
 In his writings, a mixed form of the spirit of a litterateur and the searching heart of a historian has emerged
 indira gandhi ko kaalpanik patr likhane ke bahaane unhone vishwa itihaas kaa adhyay-dar-adhyay likh daalaa
 These letters were never actually sent, but by this, a simple communicative and well-written text like a glimpse of world history was easily prepared
 bharat kii khoj ne lokapriyata ke alag pratimaan rache hai, jis par aadhaarit bharat ek khoj naam se ek uttam dharawahik kaa nirmaan bhi hua he
 His autobiography About my story, the well-known Manishi Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan believes that his autobiography, which narrates the story of his life and struggle without trying to prove self-pity or moral superiority, is one of the most notable books of our era
 Is one of in pustakon ke atirikt nehru ji ne aganit vyaakhyaan diye, lekh likhe tathaa patr likhe
 For their publication, 'jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund' decided to publish a bibliography

 unhone mohammadan anglo-oriental kalege kii sthapana kii jo baad main viksit hokar aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay bana
 His efforts marked the beginning of the Aligarh Revolution, in which Muslim intellectuals and leaders involved worked to separate Indian Muslims from Hindus and laid the foundation of Pakistan
 sayed ahamed khan east india company main kaam karte hue kaafii prasiddh hue
 Sayyid Ahmad remained loyal to the British Empire during the first Indian independence struggle of 1857 and saved the lives of many Europeans
 baad main us sangram ke vishay main unhone ek kitaab likhi: asabaab-e-baghaavat-e-hind, jisamen unhone british sarkaar kii nitiyon kii aalochana kii
 He was the most influential Muslim leader of his time
 unka vichaar tha ki bharat ke musalamaanon ko british sarkaar ke prati vafaadaar nahin rahanaa chaiye
 He insisted on making Urdu a collective language of Indian Muslims
 saiyad ahamed khaan kaa janm 17 oktober 1817 main dilli ke saadaat khandaan main hua tha
 He was fond of reading and writing since childhood and his mother had more influence than father
 maan ke kushal paalan poshan or unase mili sanskaron kaa asar sar saiyad ke baad ke dinon main spasht dikhaa, jab vah saamaajik utthan ke kshetra main aae
 After the father's death at the age of 22, the family faced financial difficulties and had to earn a living only after a little education
 unhone 1830 i
 main east india company main lipic ke pad par kaam karnaa shuru kiya, kintu 1841 i
 main mainpuri main up-nyaayadhish kii yogyata hasil kii or vibhinn sthanon par nyaayik vibhaagon main kaam kiya
 However, despite being in the highest rank, he spent all his life in Fatehali
 1857 kii mahakranti or uski asafalataa ke dushprinaam unhone apni aankhon se dekha
 His house was destroyed, close relatives were killed, his mother was saved in a horse stables for a week after saving her life
 apane parivaar kii is barbaadi ko dekhakar unka man vichlit ho gaya or unke dilo-dimaag main rashtrabhakti kii lahar karavatein lene lageen
 Troubled by this uneasiness, he decided to leave India and settle in Egypt
 angrezon ne unako apni ore karne ke liye mir sadiq or mir rustam ali ko unke paas bheja or unhe talluka jahanabad dene kaa laalach diya
 This was an opportunity that they could be trapped in their web
 ve dhanadhy kii zindagi basar kar sakate the, lekin ve bahut hi budhimaan or samajhadaar vyakti the
 He rejected greed at that time and considered it better to adopt patriotism
 baad main unhone yah mahasoos kiya ki agar bharat ke musalamaanon ko is kothri se nahin nikaala gaya to ek din hamaari qaom tabah or barbaad ho jaaegi or vah kabhi bhi uth na sakegi
 Therefore, he changed his intention to go to Egypt and started taking the torch of welfare and existence towards his community and country
 yah sach he ki unhone gair faujee angrezon ko apane ghar main panaah di, lekin unke samarthak bilkul na the, balki vah islamic shiksha va samskruti ke chaahane vaale the
 His vision was well aware of the conspiracy of the British
 unhen maaloom tha ki angrezi hukumat bharat par sthapit ho chuki he or unhone unhen haraane ke liye shaikshik maidan ko behatar samajha
 Therefore, through his excellent articles, he tried to inculcate the spirit of education and culture in the community so that no one can dominate our demos in the educational field
 musalmaan unhen kufr kaa fatwa dete rahe baavzood iske qaom ke dushman banakar yaa bigadakar na mili balki narmi se unhen samajhane kii koshish karte rahe
 They knew very well that this demoness was there, so regardless of what they said, they kept trying to reach their destination
 aaj muslim qaom ye baat sweekaar karti he ki sar saiyad ahamed khan ne qaom ke liye kya kuch nahin kiya
 Sir Syed's tradition in Muslim politics emerged as the Muslim League
 bhartiya rashtriya congress ke virudhd unka propaganda tha ki congress hindu aadhipaty party he or propaganda azaad-purv bharat ke muslimon main jivit rahaa

 nabhikeey astr yaa parmaanu bam ek visphotak yukti he jisaki vidhvansak shakti kaa aadhaar nabhikeey abhikriya hoti he
 It can be made by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission or by the combination of both these types of nuclear reactions
 dono hi prakaar kii abhikriya ke parinamswaroop thode hi saamagree se baari maatra main urja utpann hoti he
 Today's nuclear weapon, slightly larger than one thousand kilos, can generate as much energy as it can generate from conventional explosives of several billion kilos
 nabhikeey hathiyaar mahavinashkari hathiyaar kahe jate hai
 The most powerful explosive used in World War II was the name 'blockbuster'
 iske nirmaan main tab tak gyaat prabalatam visphotak trinitrotoluin kaa 11 ton prayukt hua tha
 The first atomic bomb, which was 2000 times more powerful than this explosive, was detonated by T
N
 T
 was equivalent to an explosion of 22,000 tons
 ab to pratham parmaanu bam se bahut adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam bane hai
 The detonating substance in a nuclear bomb is uranium or plutonium
 uranium yaa plutonium ke parmaanu vikhandan se hi shakti praapt hoti he
 For this, neutrons are struck in the nucleus of the atom
 is prahaar se hi bahut badi maatra main urja praapt hoti he
 This process is called physicist nuclear fission
 parmaanu ke nabhik ke abhyantar main jo neutron hote hai unheen se neutron mukt hote hai
 These neutrons strike other atoms and cause fragmentation again
 ye phir anya parmaanuon kaa vikhandan karte hai
 This is how chain actions begin
 parmaanu bam kii aniyantrit shrunkhlaa kriyaaon ke falswaroop bheeshan prachandta ke saath parmaanu kaa visphot hota he
 Many isotopes of uranium are known
 saamaanya uranium main 99
3 pratishat you-238 or 0
7 pratishat you-235 rahete hai
 The fragmentation of U-238 is not as easy as the fragmentation of U-235
 you-235 main you-238 kii apeksha teen neutron kam rahete hai
 It is due to this lack of neutrons that fragmentation of U-235 occurs easily
 anya vikhandaneey padaarth jo parmaanu bam main kaam aate hai ve you-233 or plutonium-239 hai
 a nuclear explosion requires critical codes of fissile material
 shrunkhlaa kriya ke chaalu karne ke liye kranthik sanhati nunatam maatra he
 If the amount of fissile material is less than the critical code, then the neutron will only continue to crumble
 maatra ke dhire dhire badhaane se ek samay aisi avasthaa aegi jab kam se kam ek unmukt neutron ek nae parmaanu par prahaar kar uskaa vikhandan kar degaa
 On reaching such a state, the fragmentation process starts running automatically
 kranthik sanhati kii maatra gopneey he
 Only those nations that make nuclear bombs know and do not tell others
 yadi you-235 kii kranthik sanhati 20 pound he to das das pound do jagah lene se shrunkhlaa kriya chaalu nahin hogi
 Taking 20 pounds together will start the chain operation
 shrunkhlaakriya main neutron kii sankhya badi shighrata se badhati he
 Fission in a nuclear bomb raises the heat of uranium and other substances adjacent to it very quickly
 dhatvik uranium badi unchi daab or taap par tapadipt gas main parinat ho jaataa he
 The temperature of the explosive body is 10,00,00,000 ° C
 Wakes up to itane unche taap par uranium kii thapi hat jaati he
 Then the whole body explodes with great intensity
 parmaanu bam ke visphutit hone par aadhaat tarangen utpann hoti hai jo dhwani kii gati se bhi adhik gati se chaaron ore failati he
 When the atomic bomb is detonated above the earth, the waves hit the earth and rise up and create a new shock that spreads up and down intensely
 bam sphot kaa centre tatkaal tapt hokar nirvaat utpann karata he
 The surrounding cold air rushes to fill the vacuum
 is prakaar parmaanu bam se gharon par aghat padane se ve tut jate hai
 Explosive uranium turns into other elements, radioactive rays emanate from it and destroy living cells and destroy them
 bam kaa vinashikari kaary aghat tarangon, vedhi kirnon tathaa atyadhik ooshmaa utpaadan ke kaaran hota he
 Hydrogen bombs are a variety of nuclear bombs
 hydrogen bam yaa ech-bam adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam hota he
 It requires isotopic du terium and tritium of hydrogen
 parmaanuon ke sanlayan karne se bam kaa visphot hota he
 For this fusion, the temperature is very high, about 500,00,000 ° C
 Is required
 yah taap surya ke ooshnatam bhaag ke taap se bahut unchaa he
 Atomic bombs can achieve such high temperature
 america, england, rus, china va bharat ne hydrogen bam kaa pareekshan kiya
 North Korea is also believed to have made such a dangerous bomb
 jab parmaanu bam aavashyak taap utpann karata he tabhi hydrogen parmaanu sanlayit hote hai
 This fusion produces heat and powerful rays that turn hydrogen into helium
 1922 i
 main pehle pahal pataa laga tha ki hydrogen parmaanu ke visphot se bahut adhik urja utpann ho sakati he
 Heavy hydrogen called deuterium was invented in 1932 and heavy hydrogen called triterium in 1934
 1950 i
 main sanyukt rajya america ke raashtrapati tru main ne hydrogen bam taiyaar karne kaa aadesh diya
 For this, a large factory was established in 1951 in South Carolina
 1953 i
 main raashtrapati ijenhabar ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki TNT ke lakhon ton ke baraabar hydrogen bam taiyaar ho gaya he
 In 1955 AD, the Soviet Union tested hydrogen bombs
 china or france ne bhi hydrogen bam ke visphot kiye hai

 The root of the word statistics is the Latin word status, meaning 'political state'

 Hence, some ancient writers have designated statistics as state science
 kramash: is shabd ko maatraatmak sarthakata praapt hui or do vibhinn arthon main iskaa prayog chalata rahaa
 On the one hand it was related to facts such as "birth and death statistics" denoted by numerals, and on the other hand to draw useful conclusions from numerical data, ie science

 The impact of Galton and Karl Pearson led to remarkable progress in this science and in the next three decades, the foundations of this science were consolidated
 yah kah dena uchit he ki din-din nae nae kshetron main prayukt hone vaale is vishay kii imaarat abhi teji se banan kii sthiti main he
 Research work, especially in the mathematical theory of statistics, is happening at such a rapid pace and new facts are coming out at such a rapid pace that it is becoming difficult to keep track of them all
 maanav gyaan or kriya ke vividh kshetron main is vishay kii prayukti din-din bad rahi he or badi upyogi siddh ho rahi he
 Gaining knowledge of the operation of rules from the intricate complexities of the outside world is one of the major objectives of science to explain various natural phenomena based on some fundamental principles
 in niyamon ke parichaalan ke gyaan se hamen "kaaran" or "prabhaav" ke sambandh main jaankaree hoti he
 In a planned experiment, we can often establish a simple method in place of a complex method of causes, in which the situation is diverted for one reason at a time
 yah sambhavat: adarsh sthiti he or bahut se kshetron main is prakaar kaa prayog sambhav nahin he
 For example, the observer cannot use social facts and has to carry out situations that are not under his control
 sankhyikee anek kaarnon se prabhavit aankadon se sambandhit he
 The purpose of experiments is to sort out all the causes except one from the junk of reasons
 yah sabhi sthitiyon main sambhav na hone ke kaaran vishleshan ke liye sankhyikee main kaaran samooh ke prabhavadhin aankadon ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he or aankadon se hi yah bhi jaanane kii koshish kii jaati he ki koun-koun se kaaran mahatv ke hai or inamen se prayek kaaran ke parichaalan se prekshit prabhaav par kiskaa kitna asar padaa he
 This is the unique and unique power of this branch of our knowledge, which has led to its prosperity and has become ubiquitous
 udaahranarth, maan len ki gehun kii upaj par vibhinn khaadon kaa prabhaav hamen gyaat karnaa he
 For this, it is not enough that by selecting a plot equal to the number of manures, each manure should be cultivated with the treatment of each manure and the difference in yield can be taken as a measure of the effect of manure; Because it can be proved that the yield of different plots varies with the effect of the same fertilizer
 bhukhndon main upaj kii bhinnata ke kaaran anek hote hai
 The effect of fertilizer in different amounts should be studied, that is, experiments are done on different floors, different farms and different years, then the study becomes even more complicated

 Nowadays, in addition to agriculture, this method is also being used in many other fields
 vyashti kaa adhyayan na karke, samshti naam se abhihit samooh yaa samudaay kaa adhyayan karnaa sankhyikee vigyaan or moulik dharna he
 We can define it as a branch of scientific method that calculates or measures the macroeconomic properties obtained, such as from the height or weight of a human class, from the data of natural phenomena such as the stress strength of metal punches produced in a particular container, Or briefly study any experimental data derived from frequency action
 at: sankhyikeevid kaa pehla karttavya aankadon kaa sangrah karnaa he
 He can do this himself, or use other data collected for other purposes
 pehle prakaar ke aankadon par pradhan or duusare prakaar ke aankadon ko gaun kehete hai
 Before arriving at a result using the data, its reliability should be checked
 sankhyikeey adhyayan kaa doosraa kadam ekatrit aankadon kaa vargeekaran or saraneekaran he
 If the number of observations is high, then classification of data is not only desirable but also necessary
 sanghanan karte samay kuch maatra main soochnaaon kaa tyaag karnaa padataa he
 But the brain is unable to understand the meaning of large number zodiac
 at: aankadon se nirupit tathy kaa adhimulyan karne ke liye sanghanan aavashyak he
 After compaction, the data are represented as frequency-distribution tables

 The data can also be presented by curve diagrams, pictograms, etc
 And this type of presentation usually helps the brain to interpret, predict, predict and finally predict the data
 kuch sankhyikeevid purvanumaan ko sankhyikeevid kaa kartavya nahin maanate, lekin adhikansh maanate hai
 In the study of the population of a population, separate study of each member, due to the abundance of numbers and wastage of labor and cost, is not practical
 at: jan samudaay ke sambandh main gyaan praapt karne ke liye, ham sadasyon ke chayan kaa, jinhen pratidarsh kehete hai, adhyayan karte hai
 The sample provides basic macro information
 soochna nirpeksh nischitata ke rup main ho, aisi aashaa nahin kii ja sakati
 It is often expressed as a possibility
 sankhyikee ke is bhagako aganan, kehete hai
 The statistician requires specialized training as well as preliminary arithmetic for certain elementary tasks, such as storage, classification, tabulation, accounting presentation, etc
 and later assists the higher mathematics and theory of probability for estimation, inference and forecasting
