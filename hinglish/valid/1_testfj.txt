 Human resource management is the skillful and consistent approach to managing the most valuable assets of an establishment - those working there and contributing to the achievement of business objectives individually and collectively
 "maanav sansaadhan prabandhan" or "maanav sansaadhan" shabdon kaa sthaan mukhyatah "carmik prabandhan" shabd ne le liya he, jo pratishthan main logon ke prabandhan main shaamil prakriyaaon kii vyakhya karata he
 HRM in the general sense means employing people, developing, utilizing their resources, keeping their services in line with the needs of work and reputation, and in return compensation
 isaki visheshtaon main shaamil hai: But these traditional expressions are rarely seen in theoretical normality
 kai baar karmchaaree or audyogic sambandh bhi sandehaaspad rup se samanarthak shabd ke rup main soochibaddh ho gayi hai, haalanki inhen aam taur par prabandhan or karmchaariyon ke sambandhon or karmchaariyon ke company main vyavhaar ke liye sanderbhit kiye jate hai
 The theoretical discipline is primarily based on the assumption that employees are individuals who have different goals and needs and should not be thought of as basic business resources such as trucks and filing cabinets
 is kshetra main karmchaariyon ke prati ek sakaaratmak drushtikon apanaaya jaataa he, yah maanate hue ki lagbhag sabhi karmchaaree udhyam main utpaadakta ke yogadan kii ichha rakhte hai or unke prayaason main mukhya baadha gyaan kaa abhaav, aparyaapt prashikshan or prakriya kii vifaltaaen hai
 Novice professionals working in the human resource management field are seen as a more innovative approach than the traditional approach to management
 isaki takneekein ek udhyam ke prabandhakon ko apane lakshyon ko vishistataa ke saath is prakaar vyakt karne ke liye baadhya karti hai
 It should be done in such a way that it can be understood and adopted by the employees and provide them the necessary resources for the successful execution of the assigned tasks
 is tarah HRM takneekein jab thik se lagu kii jaati hai to ve udhyam ke lakshya or samgr parichaalan kaary pranaaliyon ke prabhavi hone kii suchak hai
 In HRM too, many people play an important role in reducing risk in establishments
 carmik prabandhan jaise samanarthak shabd kaa aksar ek bahut simit arth main prayog kiya jaataa he, jo karmchaariyon kii bhartee, sadasyon ke vetan tathaa laabhon or unke kaary-jivan kii zarurat kii vyavastha uplabdh karaane jaisi gatividhiyon ke liye aavashyak he
 So if we talk about the actual definition, according to Torrington and Hall, the definition of personnel management is as follows: "aisi gatividhiyon kii ek shrinkhalaa jo: prathamtah kaam karne waalon or unke niyokta pratishthanon ke uddeshyon or kaary-sambandh kii prakruti tathaa dwitiyatah yah sunishchit karnaa ki samjhaute kaa puraa nirvaah hua he

 jabaki miller kaa suzav he ki HRM kaa sambandh: " xxrep 7 
 is the decisions and actions that concern the management of employees at all levels in the business related to the implementation of skillful policies implementation strategy towards creating competitive advantage

 Areas such as psychology, industrial engineering, industrial, judicial / epistemological studies and institutional psychology, industrial relations, sociology and critical theory: postmodernism, post-structuralism play a major role
 kai collejon or vishvavidhyalayon ne maanav sansaadhan prabandhan main snaatak or para-snaatak kii digriyon ke paathyakram rakhe hai
 The plan to use hrm's role extensively has been developed by Dave Elrich, which defined HRM functions in 4 areas: haalanki, prashasan or karmchaaree himachati kii bhoomika se pare kai or maanav sansaadhan kaary in dinon sangharsh kar rahe hai or karmchaaree himachati ko sheersh prabandhan ke liye ranneetik rup se pratikriyasheel nahin balki sakriy bhagidaar ke rup main dekha gaya he
 In addition, the HR establishment also has trouble proving how the company benefits from their activities and processes
 keval haal ke varshon main hi HR vidwaanon or HR peshewaron ne vah model viksit karne par dhyaan kendrit kiya he jo yah nirdhaarit kar saktaa he ki HR se phayda hota he
 Human resource management is involved in many processes
 saath hi unase uparyukt lakshya ko praapt karne kii apeksha kii jaati he
 These processes can be implemented by an HR department, but some tasks can also be done outsourced or by line-managers or other departments
 jab prabhavi dhang se ekikrut hote hai to ve company ko mahatvapurn aarthik laabh pradaan karte hai
 There are different types of careers available in HRM

 Activities also include managing employee interest and compensation, your access to employee records and personnel policies
 aam taur par chote vyavsaayon ko yah gatividhiyaan swayan kerani padati hai kyonki ve philhal purnakalik yaa alp-kaalik sahaayta kaa kharch vahan nahin kar pate
 haalanki unhen hameshaa yah sunishchit hona chahie ki karmchaaree maujuuda niyamon ke anuroop carmik nitiyon ke prati jaagruk rahete the-or rahete hai
 These policies often remain in the form of employee manuals that all employees have
 yah dhyaan dene yogya he ki kuch log HRM or HRD ke bich antar dekhte hai
 Such people include HRM in HRD, saying that HRD includes a wide range of activities within the establishment, such as career development, training, development of the establishment, etc
 ek lambe samay se yah tark diya jaataa rahaa he ki HR ke kaary bade pratishthanon main sanyojit kiye jane chahie, udaa
"pratishthan vikaas vibhaag main HR rahanaa chahie yaa uske aas-paas koi doosraa rasta hona chahie?" HRM activities and HRD profession have undergone tremendous changes in the last 20-30 years
 kai saal pehle bade pratishthanon main "carmik vibhaag" zyaadaatar logon ko kaam par rakhane or bhugtan karne se sambandhit kagaji karrwai ke prabandhan kaa kaam dekhte the
 More recently, establishments have considered the key role of an "HR department" that helps employees in hiring, training and managing people to enable the organization to perform tasks with maximum efficiency in a high way
 kisi upkram ke lakshyon ko praapt karne tathaa uske kaary ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye upyukt evam yogya karmchaariyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Such employees can be obtained only if they are selected scientifically
 ‘bhartee’ bhavi karmchaariyon ko khojane tathaa unhen sanghathan main rikt sthanon ke liye aavedan karne ke liye prerit karne kii prakriya he
 "recruitment of employees is the function of the Department of Secondary Management

 Recruitment of employees should be done under a planned policy

 In large industries where many tasks are done, the requirement of the employees should be prepared by the supervisor according to the department, because he is well aware of the production capacity of the employees, and is able to determine the required labor accordingly
 
 anek baar use vyavsaay ke kii sahaayta bhi leni padati he
 The desired number of labor should be clear and sure
 is prakaar vibhinn kaaryon ke liye pruthak-pruthak maang patr taiyaar kiye jate hai
 The problem of recruitment of workers was not complicated when the industries were not much developed
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke samay tathaa uske uparant jab teevrgati se audyogikaran armbh hua tab anek bhartee kii pranaaliyon kaa vikaas hua tathaa bhartee ke kai nai strot dhude gayi
 Earlier, only intermediaries were used to recruit workers

 It is necessary that secular management should be in close contact with these sources
 ek acchhee prabandhkeey niti vah he jisamen karyrat karmchaaree ko praathamikta di jaati he arthath antirik strot kaa yathasambhav pehle upyog kiya jaataa he
 If the person is not received from internal source, then source should be used outside, employment office, advertisement in newspapers etc
 bhartee se purv bhartee ke uddeshy nishchit kar liye jane chahie tathaa uddeshyon ke anuroop bhartee kii niti nirdhaarit kii jaani chahie
 More success can be achieved if these pre-determined policies are implemented by specific methods
 nishpaksh bhartee niti main nimna tathyon kaa samavesh hona chahie- In general, the recruitment policy should pay adequate attention to the number of employees and their qualities
 bharat main sarkari pratishthanon main bhartee prabandhakon dwaara hi kii jaati he
 It has been recognized that there should be no government intervention at all
 san 1955 main bhartiya sansad ne sarkari pratishthanon main bhartee hetu ek audyogic seva ayog ke bare main sukshav diya tha ki jisase kaary-pranali main adhik dakshata laayi ja sake
 The question of running these establishments more efficiently was also considered by the Estimates Committee
 sarkari pratishthanon main vibhinn padon ke liye alag-alag pranaaliyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The manager obtains the list from national registers and planning offices for the recruitment of technical staff and gets the advertisement published in newspapers
 kai baar kendriya athwa rajya sarkaar tathaa nijee pratishthanon se bhi upyukt vyakti sujhane hetu aagrah kiya jaataa he
 For these posts, the candidates have to take a written examination or interview
 saarvajanik upakramon main bhartee / niyojan hetu nimna nitiyaan sujhai gayi hai : - The selection process consists of the following steps: yadi chayan-prakriya ke antargat abhyarthiyon ko kaam karne par bal dena he to praarambhik saakshaatkaar kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Such an interview will be very brief and its main purpose is to find out the obvious defects and ineligibility of the candidates and cancel them
 bolte samay haklaana, chalate samay langadaana, haath yaa pair kaa tutaa hona, aankhon main dosha hona aadi dosha kaa pataa lagane ke liye kisi visheshgy kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Secondly, in this type of interview, information is obtained about the salary, educational qualification and experience required by the candidates
 keval unheen abhyarthiyon ko chayan ke prakriya main aage badhane kaa avasar pradaan kiya janaa chahie jinke chayan kii kuch sambhaavnaayen hon
 Some big companies print different types of applications for different categories of posts, such as by the applicant in different types of applications for vacancies in purchasing department, sales department, factory department, office etc
 In different types of application forms to be filled, the space for the following information to be filled by the applicant remains vacant- aavedan-patr praapt karne ke baad unki jaanch kii jaati he jin abhyarthiyon main nunatam apekshit yogyata se kam yogyata ho unhen asweekaar kar diya jaataa he
 Psychological testing is a systematic program that compares the behavior of two or more individuals
 bloom ke matanusaar manovaigyanik pareekshan vyakti ke vyavhaar nishpaadan evam abhiruchi ke paksh kaa ek namoona he
 It is a methodical program through which a sample of an individual's behavior is obtained
 saakshaatkaar se pehle kabhi-kabhi vyavsaayik parikshaayen lenaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 So that the technical and theoretical capacity of the applicants can be estimated
 pramukh pareekshan ye hai- All these exams can be categorized as 'mental exams'
 maansik parikshaayen le lene ke baad karmchaariyon kii vyavsaayik parikshaayen lee jaani chahie
 The most widely used tool in any selection process is 'interview'
 bina iske chayan prakriya ko purna nahin samajha jaataa he
 The higher the post in the management chain, the importance of interview in the selection process also increases according to the gravity of the post
 saakshaatkaar kaa arth vaartalap athwa unase paraspar moulik kriya se he jo saamanytah do vyaktiyon ke bich kisi vishesh uddeshy se kii jaati he
 Through this, an attempt is made to get information about the person's shape, behavioral skills, emotional stability, nature, motivation and interest etc
 ’’ The objectives of the interview are three: - saakshaatkaar kaa praathmik uddeshy kaary ke liye praarthi kii or praarthi ke liye kaary kii upyuktata kaa pataa lagaana he
 Interviewing is an art and successful interviews follow some established or valid principles for comparison between a person's abilities and work requirements
 saakshaatkaar ke pramukh baaten ye hai- The main purpose of this type of interview is to do preliminary screening or retrenchment of the applicants
 is vidhi se ayogy abhyarthiyon kaa nirasan karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he jisase ki shesh aavedan-patron kii jaanch gaharaai se kii ja sake evam saakshaatkaar ke samay anaavashyak samay nasht na ho
 This type of interview is completed in more than five minutes
 isamen adhik kushal saakshatkaariyon kii aavashyaktaa nahi hoti
 The drawback of this method is that sometimes qualified applicants are canceled because this interview is done in a hurry and the interviewees are not very skilled
 yadi uddeshy spasht rup se ayogy aavedankartao kii chantni kerani hi he, to acha yah hoga ki praarambhik saakshaatkaar ke sthaan par sabase pehle to aavedan-patron kii jaanch kii jaye or phir yadi aavashyak he ki unki ek sankshipt-likhit pariksha le lee jaay 
 This should be done in the same condition when the number of applicants is much higher than the available work
 ‘‘is prakaar ke anveshan main saamanytah nimna baton ke sambandh main jaankaree praapt kii jaati he- The next step in the selection process is to send the applicant to the doctor of the institution for detailed physical examination
 is pariksha kaa uddesh ya vyakti ke un shaareerik gunon ko prakat karnaa he jo ki vichaaradhin krity ke kushal nishpaadan kii drushti se mahatvapurn hote hai
 In this case, it will be possible to put the applicant on an inquiry which he can carry out properly and get promotions in future 
 saakshaatkaar evam pareekshanon ke aadhaar par praarthi kii niyukti karne athwa na karne ke vishay main nirnay liya jaataa he
 But before giving appointment letter, it is checked with the help of references provided by him
 chayankarta sandarbh ke jitne adhik nikat pahunchakar praarthi ke vishay main jaankaree praapt karegaa, jaankaree kii pramanikta evam vishwasaneeyata utani hi adhik hogi
 In case of receiving favorable reference, the applicant may be given a letter of appointment
 chayan prakriya dwaara jab praarthi kaa antim rup se chayan kar liya jaataa he or use niyukti-patr bhi de diya jaataa he, to aagaamee charan aata he ‘‘kaary par niyukti’’
 Applying any employee to the right act is as important as choosing it
 karmchaaree kii yathavidhi kaary par niyukti hone se karmchaaree kaa nishpaadan badhata he evam anupasthiti, durghatana dasha aadi main kami aati he
 Not only this, the morale and work capacity of the employee increases
 ‘ry par niyukti se aashay he chayan kiye gayi praarthi ko saunpe jane vaale krity kaa nirdhaaran tathaa us krity kaa praarthi ko saunpna
 After selection, the applicant is usually appointed on probation for six months or one year
 is avadhi santoshprad kaary nishpaadan kii dasha main niyukti ko sthaayee kar diya jaataa he
 If the work is not satisfactory during this period, the employee can also be removed from work
 ’’ After appointment on the job, the newly appointed employee is required to come or introduce him to the establishment, work and colleagues
 parichay vah kriya he jiske madhyam se nav-niyukti karmchaaree ko rojgaar pradaan karne vaale sanghathan ke vishay main vistrut jaankaree di jaati he
 The following topics are usually provided to the employee through 'introductory Program' iske uparant samay samay par yah dekhte rahanaa bhi aavashyak he ki jis uddeshy se karmchaaree kii niyukti kii gai thi vah puraa ho rahaa he athwa nahin
 It is called "advent" in the language of management
 ’’ Workers in the industry did not like to work more from the early stage of the 20th century until attaining independence because they were more interested in rural life

 However, the situation changed with the increase in the burden of population on agriculture and the development of industrialization
 gramin kshetron main kaam kii kami hone lagi tathaa udyogon kii ore shramikon ko aakarshith karne ke liye madhyasthon kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 The method of recruitment by middlemen is prevalent even today in both organized and unorganized industries
 in madhyasthon ko desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main alag-alag naamon se pukaara jaataa he, jaise- jaanbar, sardaar choudhary, mukaddam, forman, mistre, kangaani aadi
 In large factories, there are women examinations which are called Naikin or Mukdamin
 shramikon ko niyukt karnaa, nikaalnaa va rakhaana padonnati karnaa, chuttee dilaanaa, aadi inhi madhyasthon kaa kaam hota he
 The Wwaitley Commission has also written that employees were appointed from nearby villages
 keval kushal shramikon ko hi baahar se praapt kiya jaataa tha
 But after independence, there were many changes in the system of recruitment of workers
 shramikon kii pravasi pravriti main badlaav aayaa he tathaa unki gatishiltaa bhi badi he
 They now prefer to live in cities than in villages

 As a result, in India, many new sources of recruitment are used to obtain qualified employees in both private and social sectors
 rashtiy shram ayog ne saarvajanik kshetra ke udyogon kii shram samasyaon ke adhyayan ke dauraan apane prativedan main sarvocch adhikariyon se lekar nimnasth karmchaariyon tak kii niyukti ke vishay main vartmaan paristhiti par prakaash daalaa he
 According to the commission, a panel is prepared to appoint high officials
 jisamen sarkari tathaa gaiyr-sarkari ucchadhikariyon ke naam rahete he
 Names are recommended with the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet from this panel
 paryvekshakeey str par karmchaariyon kii niyukti ke liye sampoorn bharat se prarthana-patr aamantrit kiye jate he evam unki yogyata va kaarykushalta ke aadhaar par chayan kiya jaataa he
 Priority of local applicants is given for appointment of desired staff at functional levels

 pro0 rudrabasavraj ke adhyayan se yah bhi vidit hota he ki saarvajanik kshetra main bhartee ke jin sroton kaa upyog kiya gaya unki praathamikta kaa kram niyamanusaar hai- From the above study, information about the means of recruitment used in the public sector as well as the private sector has been obtained
 vah is prakaar hai- While forecasting the manpower requirements by the small and big industries of the private sector, the demand for labor, technical changes, government policies, etc
 are taken into consideration
 It is true that the systems used by most organizations are unproven
 keval tata, bidla, daalamia, baghad, di0si0em0 aadi jaise bade-bade sanghathanon main purnataya vaigyanik evam vivekpurna chayan paddatiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he

 There is a difference between education and training
 shiksha kaa sambandh sampoorn vaataavaran evam paristhitiyon ke gyaan evam jaankaree se hota he
 Thus, education is aimed at the general development of the individual, whereas training is intentional education which aims at the attainment of a specific type of knowledge
 It is also true that it is difficult to move towards specific training without general education
 shiksha yathochit bodh kaa saamaanya aadhaar or prashikshan karyanvayan kaa vishisht kaushal mana ja saktaa he jo donon hi karmchaaree kii yogyata, kaaryakshmata evam nipunata ke liye aavashyak he ‘‘vastav main shiksha evam prashikshan kii aavashyaktaa ke teen mukhya aadhaar he- Through training, employee dissatisfaction can be overcome, absenteeism rate can be reduced, personal development of employees can be done in the right direction

 By protecting the health of workers, their efficiency can be increased and more production can be expected from them

 phir bhi, niyamon or karon kaa mahatvapurn prabhaav rahaa: udhaaharan ke liye, margerine ke rang par 1902 ke pratibandhon ne america vaarshik khapat ko 120 million se gata kar 48 million pound kar diya
 However, by the late 1910s, it had become more popular than ever
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke aagaman ke saath, america jaise niraapad kshetron main bhi margerine kii khapat main atyadhik vruddhi hui
 In the countries closest to the war-zone, dairy products became almost unobtainable and strict rations were applied to them
 udhaaharan ke liye united kingdom aaayaatit makkhan ke liye australia or newzealand par nirbhar tha or antahsamudri hamale ke jokhim kaa matlab tha bahut kam maal vahaan pahunchataa
 Long-term economic-profit competition between margarine and dairy lobbies continued: The Great Recession in America brought a renewed wave of pro-dairy legislation; The Second World War moved back towards margarine

 In Canada, margarine was banned from 1886 to 1948, although the ban was temporarily lifted from 1917 to 1923 due to dairy shortages

 In 1948, the Supreme Court of Canada lifted the ban on margarine in the margarine context

 By the 1980s, the ban was lifted from most provinces, however, until 1995 the sale of margarine in butter paint was not legal in Ontario

 Both margarine and butter are composed of an oil-in-water mixture, where water droplets that have a diameter of 10–80 microns are uniformly dispersed throughout the fat phase in stable crystalline form
 margerine kii mul paribhaasha makkhan kii kanoonee paribhaasha se vyutpann he - donon main nunatam 16% jal or 80% vasa saamagree nihit he
 It was adopted by all major manufacturers and became the industry standard
 margerine ke mul nirmaan main pramukh kaccha maal gomance vasa tha
 Shortages in supply soon led to a combination of vegetable oils, and between 1900 and 1920 margarine was produced from a combination of animal fats and solid and liquid vegetable oils

 In the US, supply problems, coupled with changes in the law, forced manufacturers to rely almost entirely on vegetable fats by 1950, and the industry was ready for an era of product development
 dwitiya vishwayuddh kaaleen rashan ke dauraan, britain main keval do tarah ke margerine uplabdh the, ek premium brands or doosraa sasta bajet brands
 1955 main rashan ke samaapan ke saath bazaar aapurti or maang ke balon ke samaksh khul gaya or brands vipanan prachlit ho gaya
 Competition between major producers was followed in 1955 by commercial TV
 The introduction of advertising encouraged more; And, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, competing companies vied with each other to produce more flavored margarine
 1960 dashak ke madhya main, scandinavia main laat and lagom tathaa braggot naamak makkhan tel or vanaspati tel ke do nune-vasa vaale mishranon ke pravartan ne is maamle ko gher liya ki kise "margerine" kaha jaae or ek aise vivaad kii shuruuaat hui jisane shabd "sprad" ko pravartit kiya
 During 1978, an 80% fat product called krona was introduced in Europe prepared by churning a mixture of dairy cream and vegetable oils; And, in 1982, a mixture of cream and vegetable oil called Clover was introduced in the UK by the Cream Milk Marketing Board of Vegetable Oil and Mixture
 vanaspati tel or kriim sprad ai kant bilive itz note butter! sanyukt rajya america main 1986 or canada main 1991 main pravartit kiya gaya
 The basic method of preparing margarine at the present time, similar to the mege-mauris era, is to mix refined vegetable oils with skim milk, cool the mixture to turn it into a solid, and improve its composition
 vanaspati or pashu vasa alag dravnank vaale ekasmaan yogic hai
 Generally, fat that remains liquid at room temperature is known as oil
 dravnank kaa nirdhaaran vasa amlon par asantrupt esile samoohon ke dabl band kii maujuudagi dwaara kiya jaataa he; jitani adhik dabl band kii sankhya hogi, utana hi dravnank kam hoga
 Alternatively, solid fats can be produced under controlled conditions, passing hydrogen through the oil in the presence of catalytic nickel, by alteration of animal or vegetable oils
 asantrupt baandon main hydrogen kaa sangyojan, tel ke dravnank ko prabhavi taur par badhaate hue or is prakaar use "thos" main badalte hue santrupt baandon main parinat hota he
 Nevertheless, because of the potential health benefits of limiting the amount of saturated fat in the human diet, this process is controlled so that only enough bonds are hydrogenated to form the expected composition
 is tarah nirmit margerine main mana jaataa he ki hydrogenyukt vasa maujuud hota he
 Nowadays this method is used for some types of margarines although the process has been developed and sometimes other metallic catalysts such as palladium are used
 agar hydrogenikaran adhuraa he, hydrogenikaran prakriya main prayukt apekshaakrit ucch taapmaana kuch carbon-carbon dabl baandon ko oochaal kar "badal" sakate hai
 If hydrogenation of these specific bonds does not occur during the process, they may still be present in the trans fat molecules in margarine, consumption of which has been considered a risk factor for heart disease
 
 is kaaran se, aanshik rup se kade vasa kaa margerine udyog main bahut hi kam upyog kiya jaataa he
 Some tropical oils such as palm oil and coconut oil are naturally semi-solid and do not require hydrogenation
 aadhunik margerine ko malai utaare gaye doodh, namak or piskariyon ke mishran ke saath vividh vanaspati yaa pashu vasa main kisi se bhi banaaya ja saktaa he
 Like butter, margarine is 80% fat, 20% water and solid, fortified with vitamin a and sometimes D, similar to butter, which contributes nutritionally to taste, color, and manhood
 tel ko beej se dabaa kar nikaala, parishkrut or hydrogenikaran kiya jaataa he or phir pusht or synthetic caroten yaa ennatto se ranga jaataa he
 The water phase is usually reconstituted, or cultured with skimmed milk, ie lactic acid bacteria, to produce a strong flavor
 lecithin jaise pysikari puure tel main jal charan ko samaan rup se failaate hai or saamanytah namak or parirakshak bhi jode jate hai
 This oil and water emulsion is then heated, mixed and cooled
 block margerine kii tulana main mulaayam tub margerine kam hydrogenikrut, adhik taral padaarth, tel se taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Margarines made from vegetable oils are particularly important in today's market, as they are less saturated fat than butter and are generally encouraged as a healthier option, although this idea has been challenged
 margerine ke teen mukhya prakaar aam hai: There are many popular table spread margarine and mixes of butter or buttermilk sold today
 sammishran, jiskaa upyog margerine ke swaad ko behatar banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, sanyukt rajya america or australia jaise deshon main lambey samay tak avaidh tha
 Under European Union directives, a margarine product cannot be called "butter", despite having the majority of natural butter
 kuch europea deshon main makkhan aadhaarit teble sprad or margerine utpaada "makkhan mishran" ke rup main bazaar main beche ja rahe hai
 Butter mixture is now an important part of the table spread market
 brands "ai kant bilive itz note butter" ne is jaise naamon ke saath kai sprad kii qismon ko janm diya jo "atarali batterli," "you wood butter bilive it," "butiphuli batterfuli" or "butterlicious" jaise naam sahit duniya bhar ke supermarket ke shelf main paae ja sakate hai
 These buttermilk mixtures avoid labeling restrictions that imply a strong resemblance to real butter by marketing techniques
 aise vipanan yogya naam utpaada ko apekshit utpaada label se alag taur par upabhoktaaon ke saamne pesh karte hai jo margerine ko "aanshik rup se hydrogenkrut vanaspati tel" kahata he
 Margarine, especially the polyunsaturated margarine, has become a staple of the Western diet, and it overtook butter in the mid-20th century in terms of popularity
 sanyukt rajya america main, udhaaharan ke liye, 1930 main ek ausat vyakti prati varsh 18 pound makkhan or margerine se bas 2 pound adhik khaataa tha
 By the end of the 20th century, about 5 pounds of butter and about 8 pounds of margarine were being consumed by an average American
 sanyukt rajya america margerine kaa salanaa 10,000,000,000 pound aayaat or 2,000,000,000 pound niryaat karata he
 There is a special market for margarine for those following the Jewish anti-food diet laws
 kashrat main deyari utpaadon or maance ke mishran kii manaahi he or isliye vishesh koser gair deyari margerine vahaan uplabdh hai
 Kosher consumers often use these to customize baked pakwans served with meat and butter, or non-vegetarian
 2008 pasovar margerine kami ne koshar-paalak samudaay ke andar kuch zyaada santras failaayaa tha
 Margarine, which does not include dairy products, can also provide vegetarian substitutes for butter

 The roles of butter and traditional margarine are similar with respect to energy intake, but low-fat margarine and spread are also widely available
 vanaspati vasa main 7% or 86% ke bich santrupt vasa amla shaamil ho sakate hai
 Liquid oils tend to be at the lower end, while tropical oils and completely hard oils weigh at the higher end of the scale
 margarine sammishran donon prakaar ke ghatakon kaa mishran he or shaayad hi kabhi 50% santrupt vasa se adhik hota he
 Exceptions to this are some margarine or products used in traditional kitchens that require consistency under tropical conditions
 saamanyatya, aparivarti margerine main adhik santrupt vasa rahata he
 Regular butter-fat contains 65% saturated fat, although this varies somewhat with the season
 makkhan ke ek bade chammach main 7g santrupt vasa hota he
 Reduction of LDL cholesterol level in the blood and increase in HDL cholesterol level has been observed by the use of unsaturated fatty acids, which reduces the risk of heart disease
 asantrupt tel ke do prakaar maujuud hai: ekal- or bahu-asantrupt vasa, jin donon ko, santrupt vasa kii tulana main, swasthya ke liye faaydemand ke rup main manyata di gai he
 In some widely grown vegetable oils
 Such as mustard, sunflower, safflower and olive oil are found in high amounts of unsaturated fat
 margerine ke nirmaan ke dauraan, asantrupt vasa kaa kuch ansh santrupt vasa yaa trans vasa main parivartit ho saktaa he, taaki unhen ek ucch dravnank praapt ho or ve kamare ke taapmaana par thos bane rahe
 Unlike other dietary fats, trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health
 santrupt vasa amla ke samaan hi, trans vasa amla ke grahan karne or LDL cholestrol santrupti ke bich raikhik pravanta maujuud he or isliye LDL cholestrol str kii vruddhi or HDL cholestrol ke str kii kami dwaara, hrid-dhamni hriday rog kaa vardhit jokhim bana rahata he
 Because hydrogenated oils contain more trans bonds than natural oils, they are generally considered more harmful
 kai bade adhyayanon ne trans vasa kii ucch maatra ke upbhog or hrid-dhamni hriday rog or sambhawatah kuch anya rogon ke bich sambandh suchit kiya he, jisane duniya bhar main kai sarkari swasthya agenciyon ko is sifarish ke liye prerit kiya ki trans vasa kaa seven kam kiya jaae
 In the US, as a result of giving preference to homegrown oils, partial hydrogenation is common
 haalanki, 1990 ke madhya se, duniya ke kai desh, aanshik hydrogenikrut telon ke upyog se dur hatane lage hai
 This paved the way for the production of new varieties of margarine, with little or no trans fat
 2003 ke baad se, america main khaadya nirmaataa apane utpaadon par "0g" trans vasa ke rup main label lagane lage, jiskaa prabhavi taur par taatpary prati paros main 500 mi
gra
 se kam trans-vasa he; tathaapi, koi vasa trans vasa se mukt nahin he
 For example, natural butterfat contains 2–5% trans-fat acid
 tathaapi, prakritik rup se maujuud trans-vasa amla rumenic acid or trans-vaisenic amla cancerajanak-pratirodhi gun darshaate hai or is prakaar kritrim rup se taiyaar trans-vasa amlon ke bilkul viruddh prathit hote hai
 Note that US and Canadian regulation of margarine content is not uniform, so US regulatory actions may not have occurred or occurred in a different form in Canada
 atyadhik cholestrol ek swasthya jokhim he kyonki vasa nikshep kramshah dhamniyon ko avaruddh karte hai
 This makes blood flow to the brain, heart, kidneys and other parts of the body less efficient
 cholestrol, haalanki pachan ke liye aavashyak he, par aahaar main zaruri nahin he
 The human body makes cholesterol in the liver, where about 1g of cholesterol per day or 80% of the total cholesterol required for the body is produced
 shesh 20% bhojan ke seven se sidhe aata he
 Therefore, overall intake of cholesterol as a diet has less effect on blood cholesterol than the type of fat consumed
 tathaapi, kuch log anya logon kii tulana main cholestrol aahaar ke prati adhik pratikriyasheel hote hai
 The US Food and Drug Administration states that 300 mg per day is consumed by healthy people
 Should not consume more cholesterol than kuch margerine or spreadon main unke cholestrol ghataane ke prabhaav kii vajah se padap sterol easter yaa padap stenol eastron ko daalaa gaya he
 Several studies have indicated that consumption of 2 grams per day provides a reduction in LDL cholesterol of around 10%
 sterol / stenol easter swadaheen or gandharahit hai or adhikansh vasa ke anuroop hi bhautik or rasinic gunon se yukt hai
 However, they do not enter the bloodstream, but pass through the intestine, which makes low-fat margarine spreads a good tool for the delivery of sterol / stanol easers
 europea sangh Under the directives of the European Union, margarine is defined as: sabji / pashu vasa se vyutpann ek tel-main-pani kaa mishran, jisamen vasa kii nunatam maatra 80% lekin 90% se kam ho, jo 20 °C ke taapmaana par thos bana rahe or jo failaane ke liye upyukt khaadya ho
 Margarine cannot contain more than 3% milk fat content
 mishran or mishrit sprad ke liye, dugdh vasa 10% or 80% ke bich ho sakati he
 Spreads that contain 60 to 62% fat can be called "three-quarter-fat margarine" or "low-fat margarine"
 sprad jisamen 39 se 41% tak vasa shaamil ho use "ardh-vasa margerine", "kam-vasa margerine" yaa "halkaa margerine" kaha ja saktaa he
 Fat spreads with any other percentage are called "fat spreads" or "light spreads"
 is samay kai sadsy rajyon main saarvajanik swasthya kaarnon se margerine or vasa sprad main vitamin e or di kaa sangyojan anivaary he
 Voluntary confirmation of margarine with vitamins by manufacturers has been in practice since 1925, but with the advent of war in 1940, some governments took action to secure the nutritional status of their nation, making the combination of vitamins a and d mandatory
 yah anivaary pushtikaran kaa auchity is drushti se sabit hua ki aahaar main makkhan kii jagah margerine kaa istemaal kiya jane laga
 Britain united kingdom main aanshik rup se hydrogenyukt tel vaale sprad ke koi brand bikri ke liye maujuud nahin hai
 Although confirmation with vitamins a and d is still mandatory for margarine, it is only a voluntary requirement for other spreads
 canada The Canadian standard B
