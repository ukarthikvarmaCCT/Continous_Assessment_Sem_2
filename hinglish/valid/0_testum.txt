 jab lata saat saal kii thim tab wo maharashtra ain
 Lata started acting as a theater artist with her father from the age of five
 lata bachapan se hi gayak bananaa chaahati thim
 Seeing Chandin Das, a film by Kundan Lal Sehgal in childhood, he had said that she would grow up and marry Sehgal
 pehali baar lata ne vasang joglekar dwaara nirdeshit ek film kirti hasaal ke liye gaaya
 His father did not want Lata to sing for films, so this song was removed from the film
 lekin uski pratibha se vasant joglekar kaaphi prabhavit huye
 After the father's death, Lata had to bear a lot of money and struggle a lot
 unhen abhinay bahut pasand nahin tha lekin pita kii asamyik mrityu kii vazah se paison ke liye unhen kuch hindi or marathi filmon main kaam karnaa padaa
 Her first film as an actress was Pahili Mangalagaur, in which she played the younger sister of Snehaprabha Pradhan
 baad main unhone kai filmon main abhinay kiya jinamein, maajhe bal, chimukala sansar, gajabhaau, badi maan, jivan yatra, maand, chhatrapati shivaji shaamil thi
 Lata starred opposite Noor Jahan in Badi Maa, and Asha Bhoslene as her younger sister
 unhone khud kii bhoomika ke liye gane bhi gaaye or aashaa ke liye parshvagayan kiya
 In 1945, Ustad Ghulam Haider took Lata to a producer's studio for his upcoming film, in which Kamini Kaushal was playing the lead role
 ve chaahate the ki lata us film ke liye parshvagayan kare
 But Ghulam Haider felt disappointed
 1947 main vasant joglekar ne apni film aapaki seva main main lata ko gane kaa mauka diya
 Lata had a lot of discussion with the songs of this film
 iske baad lata ne majboor film ke gaanon "angreji chhora chalaa gaya" or "dil meraa todaa hai mujhe kahin kaa na choda tere pyaar ne" jaise gaanon se apni sthiti sudruth kii
 However, Lata was still looking for that particular hit
 1949 main lata ko aisa mauka film "mahal" ke "aayegaa aanevaala" geet se mila
 The song was filmed on Madhubala, the most beautiful and popular actress of the time
 yah film atyant safal rahi thi or lata tathaa madhubala donon ke liye bahut shubh sabit hui

 At the very moment he informs with the combination of Dhwansanket and Chesta that the scene has come or the event is happening

 Subsequently, Indrajal ends

 The work of Zardozi does not have its own tradition of Benaras, but now people have started doing Zardozi work in Banarasi sarees too

 Namdev was not aware that Thakur was fed milk with a spoon and the remaining milk pundits were drunk
 unhone binati kerani shuru kii he prabhu! main to aapkaa chota sa sevak hoon, doodh lekar aayaa hoon krupa karke ise grahan kiijie
 The devotee expressed his discomfort in this way - he prabhu! yah doodh main kapalaa gaay se doh kar laayaa hoon
 Oh my gobind! If you drink milk, then my mind will be calm or my father will be angry
 sone kii katori maine aapke aage rakhi he
 PA! Must drink i have not committed any sin
 yadi mere pitaaji se pratidin doodh pite ho to mujhase aap kyon nahin le rahe? he prabhu! dayaa karen
 Dad already considers me bad and worthless
 yadi aaj aapane doodh na piya to meri khayr nahin
 Dad will get me out of the house
 jo kaary namdev ke pita sari umr na kar sake vah kaary namdev ne kar diya
 That innocent child was not aware of Pandito's dishonesty
 vah thakur ji ke aage minnaten karata rahaa
 In the end the Lord came to be drawn to the devotion of the devotee
 pathar kii murti dwaara hanse
 Namdev has mentioned this in this way - ek bhakt prabhu ke hryday main bas gaya
 Lord laughed seeing Namdev
 hans kar unhone donon haath aage badhaaen or doodh pi liya
 After drinking milk, the idol became the same again
 doodh pilaakar namdev ji ghar chale gaye
 In this way the Lord gave them a darshan
 yah namdev kii bhakthi maarg par pratham jeet thi
 The prayers with pure heart brought him power
 vah bhakthi bhav vaale ho gaye or jo vachan munh nikalate vahi satya hote
 When your father came to know that you have given life and feed milk to Thakur, he was very happy
 unhone samajha unki kul safal ho gai he

 target reating point kul darshakon main se lakshyit darshakon ke ghatak kaa anumaan kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaala kharidari Is a measure of jiarapy kii tarah yah lakshyit darshakon tak pahunchne ke liye ek vishisht madhyam he jo vigyaapan dwaara reating kii yoga ke rup main mapa jaataa he
 For example, if an ad appears more than once, reaching a total audience, the TRP figure is an estimate of the amount of each GRP estimated target audience that is included in the total audience
 ek tivi vigyaapan agar 5 baar prasaarit hota he vah kul darshakon ke 50% or lakshyit darshaakon main se keval 60% tak pahunchataa he, to iskaa 250 grps hoga - arthath GRP = aavriti x pahunch - is maamle main tiarapy 250 grps main se 60% hoga = 150 tiarapy - yah lakshya reating point he, jo kul darza ke 60% he
 These two metrics are important components that determine the marketing effectiveness of a particular advertisement
 televishan reating points - tiarapy ek kasuti he jo ek channel yaa kaarykram kii lokapriyata ingit karti he or yah data vigyapandaataaon ke liye bahut upyogi he
 Nowadays, INTAM is the only electronic rating agency operating in India
 INTAM tiarapy kii gananaa ke liye do tareekon kaa istemaal karti he
 The first is frequency monitoring, where 'people Meters' are installed in sample homes and these electronic devices continuously record data about the channel viewed by family members
 'pipal meter' ek keemtee upkaran he, jo videshon se aayaat kiya jaataa he
 It reads the frequencies of the channel, which, later, is decoded into the channel names and the agency produces national data that is based on the readings of these sample households
 lekin is takanic main ek dosha he, kyonki cabel operataron aksar gharon main sanket bhejne se pehle vibhinn channelon kii aavritiyon ko badalte rahete hai
 If a channel is read according to a certain frequency, it can be misleading if there is a single down linking frequency in the whole of India
 duusari takanic adhik vishwasaneey he or bharat main apekshaakrit nai he
 In photo matching technology, the People meter continuously records small portions of the picture that is being viewed in a fixed television
 iske saath-saath yah agency sabhi channelon ke data ko bhi chote tasviir ke ansh ke aakaar main ricard karti he
 The data collected from the sample houses is then matched to the main data bank to explain the name of the channel
 And thus the national rating is produced

 He put forward the development oriented style by making the language more capable for the expression of feelings and thoughts
 apni gambhir adhyayanshiltaa or shodh pravriti ke kaaran unhone hindi main pratham di
lit
 hone kaa gaurav praapt kiya
 The birth and death of Barathwal ji, who drew the light of inspiration from the research trend on the plank of Hindi literature, both took place in village "pali" near Lens Down Zone in Garhwal region of Uttarakhand
 badthwalji ne apni saahitiyik chhavi ke darshan bachapan main hi kara diye the
 He started writing poems under the name 'ambar' during childhood
 kishoravastha main pahunchakar unhone kahani lekhan prarambh kar diya
 Two of his stories were published in Purushartha in 1918
 kanpur main apane chaatr jivan ke dauraan hi unhone 'hillman' naamak angreji masik patrika kaa sampadan karte hue apni sampadakeey pratibha ko bhi pradarshit kiya
 At the time when literary consciousness was awakened in Barathwalji, there were many challenges before Hindi
 kathin sangharshon or prayatnon ke baad ucch kakshaon main hindi ke pathan-pathan kii vyavastha to ho gai thi, lekin hindi sahitya ke gahan adhyayan or shodh ko koi thos aadhaar nahin mil paaya tha
 Creators like Acharya Ramchandra Shukla and Babu Shyam Sundar Das were active in the field of criticism
 badthwalji ne is paridrishy main apni anveshnatmak kshamta ke sahare hindi kshetra main shodh kii sudrudh parampara kii neenv daali
 The new beliefs established in the context of saint literature revealed his research potential
 unhone pehali baar sant, sidgh, nath or bhakthi sahitya kii khoj or vishleshan main apni anusandhanatmak drushti ko lagaaya
 Unlike Shukla ji, he proved the Bhakti movement not to be the result of the disappointment of the Hindu caste, but proved it to be a natural development of the Bhakti stream
 is sandarbh main likhe unke shodh lekh unke gambheer adhyayan or manan ke saath-saath unki moulik drushti ke bhi parichaayak hai
 Later writers based their literary beliefs on the basis of analysis
 unhone swayan kaha, 'bhashaa falti phoolati to he sahitya main, ankurit hoti he bolchaal main, saadhaaran bolchaal par boli manj-sudharkar saahitiyik bhashaa ban jaati he
 'in this way, in the style he adopted for emotionalism, his main focus was on language
 unhone sanskrit, avadhi, brajabhasha, arabi evam farsi ke shabdon ko khadiboli ke vyakaran or uccharan main dhalkar apanaaya
 Barathwalji would surely have created a vast literature, if he had come with a long life
 da sampoornanand ne thik hi kaha he,'yadi aayu ne dhokhaa na diya hota to ve or bhi gambhir rachanaaon kaa sarjan karte
 'in the short term, he will always be remembered for the strong foundation of study and research
 babu shayamsundar das ke nirdesan main agreji main likhe unke shodh prabandh 'da nirgun skool of hindi poetry' par kaashi vishavidhyalay ne unhen dilitaki oopaadhi pradaan kii
 That dissertation was strongly welcomed in the Hindi literature world
 use bhuri - bhuri prashansa mili
 Dr
 Ranade, Professor of Philosophy of Prayag University, expressed his opinion on this and said that 'this is an important gift not only for the discussion of Hindi literature but also for philosophical interpretation of mysticism
 ' baad main yah shodh prabandh 'hindi main nirgun sampradaay' naam se hindi main prakashit hua
 In the Hindi world, Barthwalji made an identity due to his research attitude and review vision, but his essayists saw the flourishing of his essay art in reflective essays like 'kaneripav' 'gangabai' 'nature of worship in Hindi literature', 'kavi Keshavdas'' Roop also found a lot of appreciation in the Hindi world
 unki prakashit kritiyon main -'yoga pravaah', 'makrand', da peetambardutt badthwaal ke shreshth niabandh' aadi hai
 He compiled and edited the works of poet Gorakhnath which was published under the name 'gorakh Bani'
 hindi ke atirikt angreji main bhi unhone kuch shreshth saahitiyik niabandh likhe, jinamein - misticism in hindi poetry' or'misticism in kabir' vishesh ullekhneey hai
 The peculiarity of Baratwalji's essays is that the essence of the essay becomes clear in the beginning
 niabandh ke praarambhik vaakya rochak prastaavna kii tarah ubharate hai
 Then the writer goes down into the depth of the subject
 taarkik dhang se vishay saamagree ko sajaakar vah pathak ko lubhaate hue bady rochakata or jigyaasa ke saath vishay ke nishkarsh tak pahunchaata he
 In addition to research articles and essays, he expressed his interest in Naturopathy and Yoga system by writing books like 'pranayam Vigyan and Kala' and 'meditation with self-healing'
 gadhwali lok-sahitya kii taraf bhi unka gaharaa rujhaan tha
 He also translated 'king Arthur and Nights of the Rowd Table' into Hindi for children

 He based his studies on spiritual creations

 His entire writing is the result of his deep learning
 kaha jaataa he ki mastishk kii daastaa unke swabhaav ke vipareet thi
