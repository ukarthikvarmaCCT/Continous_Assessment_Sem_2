 jal ke saath kriya ke falswaroop prati gram sandra amla 205 calories ushm kaa utpaadan karata he
 Concentrated acid draws water from organic materials, wood and animal tissues, which results in the decomposition of organic materials and the cuckoo as a residue
 gandhakaml lavan banaata he, jise salphet kehete hai
 Sulfates are common or neutral salts, such as normal sodium sulfate or acidic sodium bisulfate
 amleey isliye ki isamen ab bhi ek hydrogen rahata he, jo ksharakon se pratisthapit ho saktaa he
 Sulphates are formed by the action of acids on metals, metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates or other salts
 adhikansh sulphate jalaviley hote hai
 Only calcium, barium, strontium, and sis salts are insoluble or very soluble in water
 anek lavan audyogic mahatv ke hai
 Barium and sis sulfate are used as pigments, sodium sulfate is used in paper manufacture, copper sulfate as a pesticide, and calcium sulfate as a plaster of Paris
 sis or ispaat par sandra amla kii koi kriya nahin hoti
 Therefore, Sis and steel vessels are used in the manufacture of acids and for keeping acids
 prayogshaalaon main nimnaankit teen ritiyon se alp maatra main gandhakaml taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he : By dissolving sulfur trixide in water, hydrogen paroxide tathaa sulfur dioxide kii sidhi kriya se- By the slow oxidation of a solution of sulfuric acid in the air
 audyogic str par sis-kaksh-vidhi tathaa sansparsh vidhi se amla kaa utpaadan hota he
 In the contact method, sulfur dioxide is first formed by the combustion of sulfur, such as sulfur or iron sulfide, and is converted into sulfur dioxide by the oxygenation of air in the presence of a platinum metallic asbestos catalyst, which dissolves in water to form sulfur
 is vidhi main jal kii upasthiti main nitric amla dwaara sulfur dioxide ke oxikaran se amla banataa he
 This action takes place in large Sis chambers, hence its name is 'sis-chamber-method'
 is vidhi kaa upyog baari maatra main salphuric amla banane ke liye hota tha, kintu isaki kuch kamiyaan hai jiske kaaran ab iskaa sthaan sansparsh prakram ne le liya he
 The first factory to manufacture Gandhakamal on a large scale was established in 1740 AD in Richmond near London by a scientist named Ward
 nirmaan ke liye gandhak tathaa shore ke mishran ko lohe ke paatr main garam kiya jaataa tha or amla ke vaashp ko kaanch ke paatro main jinamein jal bharaa rahata tha, ekatra kiya jaataa tha
 The dilute acid obtained in this way was concentrated in glass containers above the sand boiler
 kuch samay pashchaat sheeghra tuutanevaale kaanch ke paatro ke sthaan par chah foot chaude sis kakshon kaa prayog hone laga
 In 1810, the use of modern seashell method started by the hard work of a scientist named Holker
 1818 i
 se gandhak dwizarkik kii prapti ke liye kachche maal gandhak ke sthaan par pirietiess naamak khanij kaa prayog hone laga
 The Sise-chamber method was modernized by the development of the gay-lupac Pillar in 1827 AD and the Globar Pillar in 1859 AD
 yahan nitrogen ke oxide, gandhak dwizarkik tathaa vaayu ko kaksh main pravesh karaayaa jaataa he
 Such a gas mixture is injected into the 25-foot-high Glover column from below
 is stambh main upar se ge-lusac stambh kaa gandhakaml tathaa nitrosil gandhakaml kaa mishran tapakataa he
 The gas mixture enters the sis chamber after exiting the column
 saadharantaya sis kaksh teen rahete hai
 Here steam also enters the chamber
 gas mishran or bhaap ke bich kriya hokar, gandhakaml banakar, kaksh ke pende main ikattha hota he
 The residual gases now enter the gay-lussac column
 inamen pradhanthya nitrogen ke oxide rahete hai
 The gay-lussac column is filled with pieces of coke or stone
 usamen upar se gandhakaml tapakataa he or rukaawat ke kaaran dhire-dhire girakar, nitrogen ke oxidon ko avashoshit kar, nitrosil gandhakaml banataa he or glover stambh main prayukt hota he
 In this way, the loss of nitrogen oxides is saved
 sis kaksh se praapt amla ashuddh hota he
 The impurities contain arsonic, nitrogen oxides and some salts
 aisa amla pradhanthya urvarak ke nirmaan main prayukt hota he
 Pure acid is not necessary for this
 aisa amla sasta hota he
 Another method of manufacturing sulfur acid is the contact method
 is vidhi se praapt amla adhik shuddh or sandra hota he
 It was developed by a scientist named Nitz in 1889–90 AD
 germany kii badishche anilin and soda fabric company ne is vidhi se sarvapratham amla taiyaar kiya, at: ise badishche vidhi, athwa badishche prakram bhi kehete hai
 Most of the world's sulfuricides are manufactured nowadays by contact method
 isse kisi bhi sandran kaa amla praapt ho saktaa he
 In this method, sulfur is obtained by burning sulfur, or by acquiring pyrites
 ise vaayu ke saath milakar utprerak par le laayaa jaataa he, jahaan gandhak dwizarkik vaayu ke oxigen se sanyukt hokar gandhak trioxide banataa he
 "oleum" is obtained by absorbing sulfur trioxide into the concentrated sulfur
 olium kii jal ke saath kriya se vaanchit sandratha ke amla ko praapt kiya jaataa he
 First microdivided platinum was used as a catalyst
 yah bahut mahanga padataa tha
 When vanadium pentoxide is used in place of platinum, it is much cheaper than platinum
 utprerak kii kriyasheeltaa kam na ho jaae, iske liye aavashyak he ki sulfur dioxide arsenic, raakh tathaa dhul kanon se bilkul mukt ho
 Hence, the sulfur is arranged for filtering the bifurcation and it is passed through such substances in which arsenic is completely released
 yadi gas ko shuddh na kar liya jaae, to utprerak kii kaaryashiltaa jald nasht ho sakati he
 The gases that enter the catalytic chamber contain sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen
 urdhwadhar paatro main utprerak rakhaa rahata he
 The gas released there is absorbed into the concentrated sulfuric acid
 isse olium praapt hota he
 Up to 40 percent more sulfur in the oleum can be absorbed in addition to 100 per cent of sulfur
 aavashyak maatra main pani daalkar, isse vaanchit sandratha kaa amla praapt kar sakate hai
 Several acid manufacturing plants have been made by contact method, which can give more pure and less expensive acid
 aise sanyantr ab bane hai jinamein 24 ghante main 600 ton amla taiyaar ho sake
 Few people are sufficient to take care of them
 prati ton amla ke liye ek ton se adhik unchi daab vaali samprukt bhaap, yaa ati tapt bhaap, kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 To obtain 100 acid per tonne requires 35 kilowatts of electricity and 4,000 gallons of cold water

 The journalist then asked, "can we call it 'bhimayan'?" Ambedkar said, you can say but i will not say
 kyonki main khud ko gautam buddha ke samaan nahin laana chahta
 However, the Buddhist elements of Indian Navyani Buddhism pay respect to Ambedkar and Gautama Buddha, because they consider Ambedkar as their spiritual leader and Buddha as their mentor

 The story of the use of compass by the Chinese in ancient times is hardly a fiction
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki 2,634 isvi purv main china desh ke samrat "hwangti' ke rath par dakshin disha pradarshit karne ke liye ek yantra kii vyavastha rahati thi
 There is also a possibility that the Arabs have learned the use of compass from the Chinese and they have introduced it in Europe
 europea sahitya main diksuchak kaa pratham parichay 1200 isvi main athwa iske uparaant hi miltaa he
 Since 1400 AD, the use of this device has increased tremendously in navigation, navigation and navigation
 navik diksuchak atyadhik samay tak bade hi aprishkrut yantra the1 1820 isvi main barlo ne chaar paanch samaantar chumbakon se yukt ek patrak kaa sutarapaat kiya
 In 1876, Sir William Tomson produced his dry sheet compass
 san 1882 main dravadiksuchak kaa nirmaan hua
 There are mainly four types of compasses: chumbakeey diksuchak - yah nideshak bal praapt karne ke liye prithvi ke chumbakeey kshetra par nirbhar karata he
 Rotating compass - it receives its director force from the rotation of the earth
 radio diksuchak - isaki karypranali betaar siddhant par aadhaarit he
 Sun or star compass - its use depends on the Sun or any star being visible
 chumbakeey diksuchak kshaitij disha gyaat karne kaa yantra he
 The simple form of this device is a magnetic needle, which is balanced on a mortise so that it is free to rotate in the horizontal direction of the Earth's magnetic field
 "samaan dhruvon main paraspar pratikarshan or asmaan dhruvon main paraspar aakarshan hota he', yahi chumbakeey diksuchak kaa siddhant he
 Accordingly, a magnetic needle hanging freely from its center of gravity points north and south across the horizontal plane, as the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field acts on it
 isamen nimnlikhit trutiyaan pai jaati hai : 1
 Variance - This is the angle between the geometric meridian and the magnetic meridian, depending on the position of the compass
 vastav main, diksuchak kii sui thik uttar kii ore sanket nahin karti
 As a result, there is an error in the reading of the compass, which is called navigational variance and scientist problem
 yah chumbakeey paryvekshanon dwaara gyaat kiya jaataa he or saraniyon ke rup main prakashit kar diya jaataa he
 2
 Deviations - This second type of error, called deviation, is caused by local magnetic effects in the reading of the magnetic meridian and compass
 diksuchakadhaani main lohe ke tukade or trutipurak chumbak lagane se, yah truti yathasambhav dur kar di jaati he
 a table is displayed showing the residual deviation
 prayek vichlansaarini ek vishesh diksuchak sansthaapan ke liye hi prayukt hoti he
 This magnetic compass is more complex and precise than an ordinary device
 is yantra ke paanch mukhya bhaag hote hai : patrak, chumbakeey suiyaan, ratnit topi, kilak tathaa katoraa
 The gemstone cap is attached at the center of the sheet and various magnetic needles are attached at the bottom of the sheet
 patrak or suiyon kii yah sampurna vyavastha, katore ke andar ek kendriya kilak par aropi is prakaar santulit rahati he ki chaahe pot kii sthiti main kitna bhi parivartan ho jaae, diksuchak patrak sadaiv kshaitij avasthaa main rahata he
 a compass sheet is a horizontal circular disk of paper or asbestos
 yah patrak, spasht rup se pradhan digbinduon, uttar, purv, dakshin or pashchim, main chinhit rahata he
 In the middle of these points, the inner principal points are marked North East, North West, South East and South West
 inke madhya main bhi ardhabindu or chaturth bindu ankit hote hai
 Thus, on the edge of the old compass sheet, 32 points are marked in the direction and the difference between them is equal
 aadhunik diksuchak patrak par, uttar se aarambh karke, dakshinavart disha main 0rou se lekar 360rou tak ke chinh ankit hote hai
 After finding the northern direction by the compass, there is a need to find the angle between the vehicle's northern direction and the direction of its intended path
 diksuchak dwaara gyaat kii hui kisi lakshya kii disha uskaa dikman kehalaati he
 Dikman is represented in degrees in the same way as angles in geometry
 yah chumbakeey diksuchak kaa hi ek prakaar he or vishwa upyog kii vastu ho gaya he
 It has a simple rotating arrangement of magnet copperplate bracket, sapphire cap and mica sheet
 katoraa asut jal or 35 pratishat alcohal ke mishran se bharaa hota he
 This device is immersed in liquid
 kilak par gharshan nunatam hota he or chumbakeey sui avmandit dolan karne lagati he, jisase diksuchanapathan avilamb or suvidhapurna ho jaataa he
 It is used in the English merchant fleet and varies from fluidics to lightness of sheet and weakness of needles
 aise diksuchak kampan or aghaat dwaara atyadhik vikshepit ho jate hai or ek baar vikshepit hone par paryaapt samay ke uparaant santulit avasthaa main aate hai
 That is why the fluidic dry sheet is more useful than the compass
 yah vishesh prakaar kaa chumbakeey diksuchak he
 It does not have rotating errors and therefore it can accurately dictate rapid rotation
 ghurnanchumbakeey diksuchak main ek swat:chaalit ghurndarshi chumbakeey vyavastha ke sanrekhan main rakhaa rahata he
 In this way rotational compass and magnetic compass are combined into one device, so that there is no need for external adjustment
 bhupreran diksuchak - yah bhi chumbakeey diksuchak he, jisaki karypranali prithvi ke chumbakeey kshetra dwaara prerit vidyudvahak bal kii maap par aadhaarit he
 It consists of a coil, which rotates on the vertical axis
 iskaa upyog mukhyat: vimaanchaalak karte hai
 There are different types of manual compass, near-horizontal compass, airplane compass, survey compass, tank compass, magnetic compass
 yah achumbakeey diksuchak he, jo bhramman chakti ke siddhant par kaary karata he
 It is used in ships of ships
 isamen ek ghurndarshi hota he, jo 8,600 ghurnan prati minute kii chaal se prayavarti dhara dwaara chaalit hota he
 Its working principle is based on the rotation of the Earth
 is yantra ke liye vicharan or vichlan ke kisi sanshodhan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 This indicates the true north direction
 poton main chumbakeey diksuchakon ke sthaan par iskaa upyog atyadhik ho rahaa he
 It is also an electromagnetic compass
 yah jis radio stesan se samaswarit kiya jaataa he, usase sambadhit disha suchit karata he
 Its form is generally akin to loop aerial, as used in home radio sets that do not have external aerials
 radio diksuchak dwaara bahuterey vyaktiyon kaa jivan samudr par bachaaya ja sakaa he
 With the help of Sun direction, it is a machine to find the subordinate direction of reality
 surya diksuchak visheshat: dhruviya udaan ke liye laabhprad hote hai
 Here the magnetic compass is very difficult to use due to the change of magnetic variance and the director force

 Fake certificate of school made after the incident adhivaktaa sajjanraj surana ne antim bahes ko aage badhaate hue kaha ki abhiyojan ne sant asaramji baapu ke khilaaf farji tareeke se gavaah or sakshya banaae he, unhone kaha ki uttarapradesh sthit shahjahanpur ke praathmik skool ke principal arvind vaajapeyi ne court main mithyaa gavaahi di thi ki vah ] tak skool kaa principal tha
 Whereas in reality he retired a year ago
 adhivaktaa surana ne kaha ki tathakthith ghatana ke baad peedita abhibhavak ne shadyantr ke tahat ladki kaa schuli sthanantaran pramaan patr banaaya or court main pesh kar diya, iske vipareet beemaa policy ke dastavej kii taraf nyaayalay kaa dhyaan kendrit karte hue vakil ne bataaya ki is policy ke dastavej main ankit janmatithi ke aadhaar par ghatana ke din peedita balig thi

 So on what basis was the act imposed on Sant Asaramji Bapu? adhivaktaa sajjanraj surana ne yah bhi kaha ki ladki kii umr sambandhi alag-alag dastavejon main antar hone ke baavjood abhiyojan paksh ne isaki parvaah nahin kii or kisi adhikrut adhikari se un dastavejon main jo umr sambandhi antar aa rahaa tha, uski jaanch nahin karwaai
