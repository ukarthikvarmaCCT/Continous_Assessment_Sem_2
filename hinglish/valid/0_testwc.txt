 Sanvar is an element according to Jain philosophy
 iskaa arth hota he karmon ke asrav ko rokna
 Jain principles are based on seven elements
 inamen se chaar tatva- asrav, bandh, sanvar, nirjara karm siddhant ke stambh hai
 Samvar karma is the first step towards death
 sansar sagar samaan hai or jeev aatma naav ke samaan hai jo is sagar ko paar karnaa chaahati hai
 Due to the holes in this boat, the water flow of karma continues
 us chhed ko band karnaa sanvar hai
 Deeds are destroyed after grooming
 sanvar yaa karm bandh rokane ke nimnlikhit tareeken hai- Gudna is also called pachna or marking
 sharir kii twachaa par rangeen akritiyaan utkeern karne ke liye ang vishesh par ghaav karke, chira lagaakar athwa satahi chhed karke unke andar lakdi ke koyale kaa churna, raakh yaa phir rangne ke masaale bhar die jate hai
 The permanent colored figure on the skin becomes special when the wound is healed
 gudanon kaa rang praaia: gaharaa nila, kaala yaa halkaa laal rahata he
 There is another method of marking by which the plantation made is known as stigmata
 isamen kisi ek hi sthaan kii twachaa ko baar-baar katate hai or ghaav ke thik ho jane ke baad ukt sthaan par ek arbud yaa ubhara hua chakatta ban jaataa he jo dekhne main reshedaar lagata he
 Tattooing in animals is used for identification or branding, but in humans the purpose of tattooing is decorative body modification
 kuch deshon yaa jatiyon main rangeen gudane gudwane kii pratha he to kuch main keval kshatchihnon kii
 But there are also some castes in which both types of marking are prevalent, eg, residents of South Sea Island
 adamirasty dweep main rahane waalon, fiji nivaasiyon, bharat ke god evam todo, lu kyuu dweep ke bashindon or anya kai jatiyon main rangeen gudane gudwane kii pratha keval striyon tak simit he yaa thi
 In Egypt, the Latukas, who settled in the upland upstream of the Nile River, only make a flag on the bodies of women
 rangeen gudanon ke peeche praaia: alankaran kii pravriti hoti he jab ki kshatchihnon kaa mahatv adhiktar kabeelon kii pahchaan ke liye rahata he
 Many primitive tribes of Africa prefer stigmata and have carcasses all over the body for ornamentation along the middle Congo
 kahin-kahin vivaah or gudanon main paraspar gaharaa sambandh rahata he
 In Salaman Island, girls are not married until their faces and chests are tucked away
 austrailia ke adivaasiyon main vivaah se purv ladakiyon kaa peeth par kshatchihnon kaa hona anivaary he
 In Pharmosa residents, before the marriage, the girls 'faces are tattooed on their faces, and the Neugini's Papuans do the girls' entire body before the marriage
 newjiland ke maoris logon tathaa japaniyon ne rangeen gudanon kaa vikaas ucch kalatmak rup main kiya tha
 But like many other castes, both of them have mostly abandoned the practice of Judaism in the light of civilization
 malay jati main gudanon ko puraskaraswaroop grahan kiya jaataa he or keval safal tathaa pramukh shikari hi gudane gudwane ke adhikari hote hai
 Sailors of civilized countries also often get a pair of colors of their own hands and umbrellas, which often have the shape of a star or flag
 bharat ke striyaan hi gudanon kii shaukeen hoti hai lekin purushon main vaishnav log shankh, chakra, gada, padam vishnu ke chaar ayudhon ke chihn chhapavate hai or dakshin ke shaiva log trishul yaa shivlinga ke
 It is more popular among the members of the Ramanuja sect
 dwarika iske liye prasiddh sthaan he
 People also make the symbol of Om on their hands and many women get the husband's name tattooed on their arms
 nritatvashastriyon tathaa samajashastriyon ne ankan yaa gudanon kii utpatti ko lekar kai pariklpanaayen prastut kii hai kintu upyukt saakshyon ke abhaav main abhi tak inamen se kisi ko bhi antim rup se sweekaar nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 According to a section of scholars, the primitive man must have known the art of marking by accident; It is such that his finger would have been burnt by the incomplete wood at the time of burning the fire or he would have used ashes to stop the blood when a thorn and once the wound was healed, it would have started to be used for decoration
 aaj bhi kal-kaarkaanon main durghatnaon se shramikon ke shariron par, unke na chaahane par bhi gudane ban jate hai
 According to M
 Neuberger, the origin of the canes can be traced back to the primitive medical system, which used ash, coal powder and dyes to heal wounds
 kuch anya rogon main chira lagaakar khun nikaala jaataa tha or vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki isse dur ho jayega
 Even today, the method of treating diseases by piercing certain parts of the body with special types of needles is known by the noun AQ puncturing
 katipay vidwaanon ke anusaar aadimakaleen maanav ne kapadon ke abhaav main sharir ko vicitra akritiyon main rangnaa shu degree kiya or baad main ise sthaayee rup dene ke liye gudanon kaa vikaas hua
 Some scholars regard the Gudanas with sorcery-related interpretations
 herbert spencer ke vichaar se gudana pratha kaa aarambh mritatmaon ko rakt chadhaane ke abhichaar se hua
 According to the primitive belief spread among the Mako or Māori race, their ancestors used charcoal as a color for identification in battle, and wounds on their faces when wounds were inflicted
 baad main isane pratha kaa rup le liya or anek jatiyon yaa kabeelon main akruti vishesh ke gudanon ko ganchihn ke rup main sweekaar kar liya gaya
 But W
 Ellis searched for years among the tribals in the Polynesia Islands and came to the conclusion that it was impossible to arrive at any one written theory in this regard
 chiler juun ke jaisaa ek vahya paraseete keet he jo kapadon main chhipakar rahata he maanav sharir se rakt chusata he
 It is white in color
 hindi main ise 'chillad' yaa 'chillar' bhi kehete hai

 The external atmosphere is generally monotonous and lacking in clarity, although long-term features may appear
 shani par hawa kii gati, 1800 kimi / ghanta tak pahunch sakati he, jo brihaspati par kii tulana main tej, par utani tej nahin jitani vah neptune par he
 Saturn has a distinctive ring system consisting of nine continuous main rings and three discrete arcs, mostly composed of ice particles with small amounts of rocky debris and dust
 basth chandramaa grah kii parikrama karte he; tirepan aadhikarik taur par namit hai
 These do not include the hundreds of "small moons" within the rings
 titan, shani kaa sabase bada or soramandal kaa doosraa sabase bada chandramaa he
 It is larger than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a large atmosphere

 The rotation of the planet is due to its flat oval shape, therefore, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator
 isaki bumadhyarekhiy or dhruviya trigyaon ke bich kareeb 10% kaa fark he - kramshah 60,268 kimi banaam 54,364 kimi
 Other gas demons in the solar system, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune are also flat but to a lesser extent
 shani soramandal kaa ekmaatr grah he jo pani se kam ghanaa - lagbhag 30% kam he
 Although Saturn's core is much denser than water, the average specific density of the planet due to the gaseous atmosphere is 0
69 g / cm3
 brihaspati prithvi ke dravyaman kaa 318 guna he jabaki shani prithvi ke dravyaman kaa 95 guna he, brihaspati or shani ek-saath soramandal ke kul grahiy dravyaman kaa 92% sahejte he
 Saturn has been declared a gas monster but it is not completely gaseous

 grah ke bheetar ke taapmaana, dabaav or ghanatv sabhi kor kii disha par teji se badhate he, jisase grah kii gahari paraton main, hydrogen ek dhaatu main parivartan kaa kaaran banataa he
 Standard planetary models suggest that Saturn has the same internal structure as Jupiter, a rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with varying volatiles of varying degrees, similar in structure to the Earth's core, but more dense
 aantarik banaavat ke bhautik model ke saath sangyojan main, grah ke gurutv vibhav ke pareekshan ne francisi khagolavidon didier soumon or tristan guilot ko grahiy kor kii badi raashi par roak ko sthaan dene ke liye anumati di
 In 2004, he estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of the Earth, which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000 km
 yah kor ek mote taral dhaatu hydrogen parat se ghira hua he, jo helium-santrupt aanvik hydrogen kii ek taral parat dwaara anugamit hui he jiskaa badhati oonchai ke saath dhire-dhire gas main badlaav hua

 Much of this excess energy is generated by the Kelvin – Helmholtz mechanism of dim gravitational compression, but this alone may not be sufficient to explain Saturn's heat yield
 vahaan ek atirikt tantra kii bhoomika honi chahie jiske dwaara shani apane gahare aantarik bhaag main apni kuch ushma helium kii buundon kii ho rahi phuhaar ke madhyam se utpann karata he
 As the droplets descend through low-density hydrogen, this process releases heat from friction and leaves the outer layer of the planet emptied of helium
 ye utarati bunde kor ke aasapaas ek helium khol main jamaa ho sakati hai
 Saturn's outer atmosphere contains 96
3% molecular hydrogen and 3
25% helium

 Amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and methane have been discovered in Saturn's atmosphere
 upree badal ammonia crystal se bane hue hai, jabaki nichle str ke badal yaa to ammonium hydroslphid yaa jal se milakar bane hue dikhaai dete hai
 Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane dissociation in the upper atmosphere and represents a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by the whirlwinds and diffusion
 yah prakaash rasinic chakra shani ke vaarshik mausami chakra dwaara thik kii hui he
 Saturn's atmosphere exhibits a striped pattern similar to that of Jupiter, but the stripes of Saturn are extremely light and very wide near the equator

 Saturn's finer clouds did not appear until the flyby of the Voyager spacecraft of the 1980s
 tab se, prithvi-aadhaarit doorabeenta us disha ke liye sudhari gai jis taraf niyamit prekshan hona ban saktaa he
 The composition of clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure

 In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope mapped a huge white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters
 1994 main ek anya chota tufaan dekha gaya tha
 The 1990 hurricane was an example of a giant white spot
 ek adwitiya lekin alpakaalik ghatana jo uttari golarddh kii greeshm sankranti ke samay ke aasapaas, har shani varsh main, mote taur par har 30 prithvi varsh main, ek baar hoti he
 The last giant white spots were seen in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the famous 1933 storm
 yadi kalkramata bani hui he, to ek or tufaan lagbhag 2020 main ghatit hoga
 Saturn has the second strongest winds among the planets in the Solar System
 waijar data purvi hawaaon ke charam ko 500 meter / second hona dikhaate he
 In images drawn from the Cassini spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere exhibited a bright blue color similar to Uranus
 is rang kaa sarvaadhik sambhavit kaaran raileh prakirnan dwaara hona tha
 Infrared mapping has shown that Saturn's south pole carries a warm polar vortex, the only known example of such an event in the solar system

 This entire structure rotates with a duration of 10 hours 39 minutes 24 seconds, which is assumed to be equal to the rotation period of Saturn's inner structure
 yah shatkoniya akruti drishyman vayumandal ke anya badalon kii tarah deshaantar main badlaav nahin karata
 The origin of this form is the subject of much speculation
 adhikansh khagolvid vishwaas karte hai yah vayumandal main kuch khadi-lahar paddati kii vajah se hua tha
 The polygonal shape has been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of the fluid
 dakshin dhruviya kshetra ke habal doorabeen ke pratichitran ek tej dhara En kii upasthiti kaa sanket karte he, par na hi kisi shaktishaalee dhruviya bhavar kaa or na hi kisi shatkoniya khadi-lahar kaa
 In November 2006, NASA reported that Cassini had observed a "cyclone-like" storm that struck the South Pole, a clearly defined eyewall En
 yah avlokan vishesh rup se ullekhneey he kyonki yaaol badal pehle kabhi prithvi ke alaava kisi anya grah par nahin dekhe gaye the
 For example, images from the Galileo spacecraft show no eyewall in En, the giant red spots of Jupiter
 dakshini dhruv tufaan arabon varshon tak ke liye maujuud hona chahie
 This vortex is equal to the size of the Earth and has winds of 550 km

 These features are cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud layers
 shani kaa ek aantarik chumbakeey kshetra he jiskaa ek saral, sudaul aakaar he - ek chumbakeey dwidhruv
 Its strength at the equator - 0
2 gauss - is about one twentieth of the area around Jupiter and slightly weaker than the Earth's magnetic field
 falswaroop shani kaa brihaspati kii tulana main kaaphi chota chumbakeey kshetra he
 When Voyager 2 entered the magnetic field, the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetic field only expanded as much as 19 Saturn radii, or 1
1 million km, although it extended within several hours and remained for about three days
 adhikansh sambhaavna he, iskaa chumbakeey kshetra brihaspati ke samaan hi utpann hua he - taral dhaatu main dhaaraon dwaara - hydrogen parat ek dhaatu-hydrogen dynamo kehalaati he
 This magnetic field is efficient in deflecting solar wind particles from the Sun
 titan chandramaa shani ke chumbakeey kshetra ke bahari hisse ke bheetar parikrama karata he or titan ke bahari vayumandal ke ynit kanon se nikle plasma kaa yogadan karata he
 Saturn's magnetic field, like that of Earth, produces polar light
 shani or surya ke bich kii ausat duuri 1

 It takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days to complete a rotation around the Sun, with an average rotation speed of 9
69 km / s
 shani kii dirghavrittakar kaksha prithvi ke parikrama tal ke saapeksh 2
48° jhuki hui he
 Due to a decentralization of 0
056, the distance between Saturn and the Sun varies by about 15
5 million kilometers between Upsaur and Apsaur, which are the nearest and farthest points respectively from the planet's Sun along its rotation path
 shani par drishyman akritiyaan bhinn-bhinn daron par gumti he jo ki akshansh par nirbhar karti he or ye bahul ghurnan avadhiyaan vibhinn kshetron ke liye aavantit kii gai he : pranali i kaa kaal 10ghante 14minute 00second he or bumadhyarekhiy kshetra sammilit karata hai, jo dakshini bumadhyarekhiy pattee ke uttari kinare se lekar uttari bumadhyarekhiy pattee ke dakshini kinare tak vistaarit he
 All other Saturn latitudes are allocated with a rotation period of 10 hours 38 minutes 25
4 seconds which is System II

 The exact value of the rotation period of the internal structure remains a mystery
 2004 main jab shani tak pahunch hui, casini ne paaya ki shani kaa radio ghurnan kaal kaaphi badha hua he, lagbhag 10ghante 45minat 45second tak
 In March 2007, it was found that the variation of radio emissions from the planet did not match the rate of rotation of Saturn
 yah antar shani ke chandramaa enceleds par gijar gatividhi kii vajah se ho saktaa he
 This activity charges the water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit and creates a drag on Saturn's magnetic field, which slows its rotation slightly compared to the planet's rotation
 shani ke ghurnan kaa naveenatam akalan casini, waijar or pyniyar se mili vibhinn maapnon ke ek sankalan par aadhaarit he, jisaki soochna sitambar 2007 main mili thi or yah 10ghante, 32minute, 35second he
 Saturn is probably best known for its system of planetary rings, which makes it visually unique

 The range of particles forming the rings range from dust particles to 10 meters
 haalanki anya gas daanvon kii bhi valay pranaliyaan he, par shani kii sabase badi or sarvaadhik drishyman he
 There are two main hypotheses about the origin of rings
 ek pariklpana he ki challe shani ke ek nasht chand ke avshesh hai
 The second hypothesis is that the rings are the discarded original nebular material from which Saturn is made
 kendriya chhallon kii kuch barf enceleds chandramaa ke barf jwalamukhi se aati he

 This requires a large orbital floor transfer
 Due to the shuttle's velocity change limitations, the velocity change requirement for floor shifting was met by using an encounter with Jupiter, rather than burning the engine
 The need for a Jupiter encounter means that Ulysses could not be powered by solar batteries, instead it was powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator

kaa doosraa pashupatinath mandir he jahaan prativarsh makar sakranti par vishaal mela lagata he Interpretation is the expression of any kind of waves of reciprocal processes, resulting in an increase, decrease, or indifference to vibrations and their effects in certain situations
 vyatikaran kaa vistrut adhyayan vishaal vibhedan shakti vaale sabhi yantron ke mul main kaam karata he
 Tomas Young incorporated this concept in physical optics
 unke baad vyatikaran kaa vyavhaar kisi bhi tarah kii tarangon yaa companon ke samavet yaa tajjanya prabhaavon ko vyakt karne ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In short, the situation arising out of the collision of waves due to any kind of waveform is termed as interference
 jab kabhi jal yaa anya kisi drav kii sataha par do bhinn tarangasamooh ek saath milen to vyatikaran kii sthiti utpann ho sakati he
 Where the wavelengths of waves belonging to one waveform are incorporated by the wavelengths of the waves belonging to another chain, the elevation of the surface of the fluid is equal to the sum of possible elevations of the independent and solitary existence of the waves at that location
 jab tarangon main se ek ke tarangashring kaa duusare ke tarangagart par samapathan hota he, tab drav kii sataha par tarangon kaa udwelan kam ho jaataa he or pratifalit unnayan ek tarang avyav ke unnayan or duusare ke avanayan ke antar ke baraabar hota he
 The vibrations produced in a sound are a simple form of this interference, where two or more waveforms, with a slight difference in wavelength, are found moving in the same direction
 prakaash kii gat tarangeey hoti he
 The energy released from a single light source is disintegrated on the lateral side of the medium
 yadi prakaash ke do swatantra strot, jinase samaan pariman or abhinn kala kii tarangen satat ni:sruth hon, ek duusare ke sannikat rakhe jaaen, to madhyam ke aasapaas urja kaa vitaran samang nahin hota, jahaan ek prakashtarang kaa shrung duusare prakashtarang ke shrung par, yaa ek kaa tarangagart duusare ke tarangagart par girtaa he, vahaan aayam bad jaataa he or aayam swaroop urja yaa prakaash kii tivrata bhi bad jaati he
 Also, if the wavelength of one falls on the wavelength of the other, the resulting amplitude is zero and the intensity of light decreases
 pehali sthiti kaa samposhi vyatikaran or duusari sthiti ko vinashi vyatikaran kehete hai
 Thin bars of transparent solids and light bubbles on soap bubbles can give a clear introduction to interference
 jab prakaash kii kirane sabun ke bulabulon, yaa sise kii patale patton par padati hai, to unki bahari or bhitari donon satahon se kirane paravartit hokar prekshak kii aankhon kii ore lautati hai or prakaash ke tarangasamoohon main, jo donon sroton se aankhon tak pahunchati hai, kalaon main sookshm antar hone ke kaaran vyatikaran hota he, jisase utpann prabhaav kaaphi mohak ore chittkarshak hote hai
 a soap bubble is often seen covered with some black lines in a monochromatic light
 kaaran yah he ki kaale dikhaai padanevaale binduon par prakaash ke do tarangasamooh, jo kramash: bulbule kii bhitari or bahari satahon se aate hai, kareeb kareeb yaa purnat: ek duusare ke prabhaav ko nasht kar dete hai
 If the bubble is seen in white light, we usually do not see black lines
 unke sthaan par rangon kii pattiyaan hoti hai
 This is because different colors, the sum of which produces white light, are of different waves, so that interfering at a point of the bubble destroys only a fraction of the color and the remaining elements of the bright light remain
 , Which produce its full chromatic effect on the eyes
 vyatikaran ke liye kuch moulik sharte hai jinaki purti aavashyak he
 Some of these are inherent in the nature of light itself and other, if the result is to be observed by experiment, it becomes necessary
 saralata ke liye ham do vidyut chumbakeey laharon par vichaar kar sakate hai, jo kisi dikbindu par, jahaan se donon lehren guzarati hai, vinashi vyatikaran utpann karen
 If the pattern of interference remains constant, that is, if the resulting light intensity is zero for each value of time at the resulting so-called point, then the following conditions must be met: prakaash dwaara utpann pratirupon ke safal prekshan ke liye do anya sharten, jinaki purti honi chahie, nimnlikhit hai, If two superimposed light sources of equal magnitude and time lines meet at a point in a far-away curtain at a particular point of time, then some exactly lines on the screen with lines of maximum intensity in the gap are seen
 ve nunatam or adhiktam tivrata kii rekhaayen vyatikaran fringen kehalaati hai
 Whenever the fringe fringes are formed by thin films, they are caused by the change in the frequency of the rays participating in the fission
 yah parivartan film kii motaai ke parivartan, yaa aaytan kone ke parivartan, ke kaaran hota he
 If the thickness is not congruent, then often both facts become functional simultaneously; But one thing is clear that when a film is being watched by the eye, it is about 25 cm from the eye
 Should be kept at a distance of
 yadi film kaa paraas bahut bada na ho, to hamaari aankhon tak film ke vibhinn binduon se aati hui kirnon ke jhukaav kii bhinnata koi adhik nahin hoti or prayek kiran kaa aaytan kone kareeb kareeb samaan hota he
 Hence the fringes are formed mainly due to the variation of film thickness
 yah bhi nitant spasht he ki film ke un sabhi binduon par, jahaan motaai samaan he, vahaan prakaash kii dipti bhi samaan hogi
 If any such point is black or bright, the rest will be black or bright accordingly
 isliye kaali yaa ujwal pattiyaan samaan motaai ke film ke vibhinn binduon ke bindupath maatr hoti he
 Such fringes are called the Newtonian rings, because Newton first studied them

 unka ek anya naam "shri 108 badrishchariparayan gadhraj mahimahendra, dharmavaibhav, dharmarakshak shiromani" bhi tha
 By this time, the throne of the Garhwal kingdom was known as the "throne of Badrinath", and devotees paid obeisance to the king before entering the temple
 yah pratha unnisvi shatabdi ke uttarardh tak jari rahi
 In the sixteenth century, the then king of Garhwal brought the Badrinath idol from the cave and installed it in the present temple
 mandir ke ban jane ke baad indaur kii maharani ahilyabai ne yahaan swarna kalash chhatri chadhaai thi
 In the twentieth century, when the Garhwal kingdom was divided into two parts, the Badrinath temple came under British rule; However, the chairman of the management committee of the temple was still the king of Garhwal
