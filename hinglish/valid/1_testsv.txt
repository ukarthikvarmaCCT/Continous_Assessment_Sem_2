 gurutvkarshan siddhant par aadhunik kaam 16 veen ke ant main or 17 veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main galileo galili ke kaam se shuru hua
 In his famous experiments used to drop balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later rotate the inclusions with careful measurement of the balls, Galileo showed that the gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects
 yah arestu ke vishwaas se ek bada prasthaan tha ki baari vastuon main ucch gurutvkarshan twaran hota he
 Galileo cited wind resistance as the reason that low-mass objects could fall into the atmosphere at a slower rate
 galileo ke kaam ne newton ke gurutv ke siddhant ke nirmaan ke liye manch taiyaar kiya Then Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself

 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the inverse square law of gravity
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The relation of the working force f between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravity constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated

 Gravity: "father, this earth, on which we dwell, rests upon?" Lilavati asked this question to her father Bhaskaracharya centuries ago
 iske uttar main bhaskaracharya ne kaha, "baale leelavati !, kuch log jo yah kehete hai ki yah prithvi sheshnag, kachua yaa hathi yaa anya kisi vastu par aadhaarit he to ve galat kehete hai
 Even if it is assumed that it rests on an object, the question remains, on which that object rests, and thus the cause of the cause and then its cause


 This sequence continues, then in jurisprudence This is called non-permanent defect
 leelavati ne kaha phir bhi yah prashn bana rahata he pitaaji ki prithvi kis cheez par tiki he? Then Bhaskaracharya said, why we cannot assume that the earth is not based on anything
 xxrep 5 
 yadi ham yah kahen ki prithvi apane hi bal se tiki he or ise gurutvkarshan shakti kah den to kya dosha he? Lilavati asked how this is possible
 tab bhaskaracharya siddhanth kii baat kehete hai ki vastuon kii shakti badi vicitra he
 Next says arthath prithvi main aakarshan shakti he
 Earth attracts heavy substances with its attraction power and due to attraction they fall to the ground

 iske baad subhash ne apane bade bhai sharathchandra bose ko patr likhakar unki raay janani chaahi ki unke dilo-dimag par to swami vivekananda or maharishi aravind ghosh ke aadarshon ne kabja kar rakkha he aise main isies banakar vah angrejon kii gulaami kaise kar paayenge? 22 april 1921 ko bharat sachiv i0es0 montague ko isies se tyaagptr dene kaa patr likhaa

 rabindranath thakur kii salaah ke anusaar bharat waapas aane par ve sarvapratham mumbai gayi or mahatma gandhi se mili
 Gandhi lived in Mani Bhavan in Mumbai
 vahaan 20 july 1921 ko gandhi ji or subhash ke bich pehali mulaakaat hui
 Gandhiji advised him to go to Kolkata and work with Dasbabu
 iske baad subhash kolkata aakar dasababu se mili
 In those days Gandhiji started a non-cooperation movement against the British government
 dasababu is aandolan kaa bengal main netritv kar rahe the
 Subhash joined them in this movement
 1922 main dasababu ne congress ke antargat swaraj party kii sthapana kii
 Swaraj Party contested the election of Kolkata Mahapalika to oppose the British government from inside the assembly and Dasbabu became the Mayor of Kolkata
 unhone subhash ko mahapalika kaa pramukh kaaryakari adhikari banaaya
 During his tenure, Subhash changed the entire structure and way of working of Kolkata Mahapalika
 kolkata main sabhi raaston ke angrezi naam badalakar unhen bhartiya naam diye gayi
 Families of those who gave up their lives in the freedom struggle started getting jobs in the Mahapalika
 bahut jald hi subhash desh ke ek mahatvapurn yuva netaa ban gayi
 Subhash along with Jawaharlal Nehru started the Independence League of Youth under the Congress
 1928 main jab simon kamishan bharat aayaa tab congress ne use kaale jhande dikhaaye
 Subhash led this movement in Kolkata
 simon kamishan ko jawaab dene ke liye congress ne bharat kaa bhavi samvidhan banane kaa kaam aath sadasyeey ayog ko saunpa
 Motilal Nehru was the chairman of this commission and Subhash was a member of it
 is ayog ne nehru report pesh kii
 In 1928, the annual Congress session was held in Kolkata under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 is adhiveshan main subhash ne khaaki ganavesh dhaaran karke motilal nehru ko sainya tareeke se salaami di
 Gandhiji did not agree with the demand for complete self-rule in those days
 is adhiveshan main unhone angrez sarkaar se dominian states maangane kii thaan lee thi
 But Subhash Babu and Jawaharlal Nehru did not agree to retreat from the demand of complete Swaraj
 ant main yah tay kiya gaya ki angrez sarkaar ko dominian states dene ke liye ek saal kaa vakt diya jaye
 If the British government did not meet this demand in a year, the Congress would demand full Swaraj
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii
 Therefore, in 1930, when the annual Congress session was held in Lahore under the chairmanship of Jawaharlal Nehru, it was decided that 26 January would be celebrated as Independence Day
 26 janvari 1931 ko kolkata main raashtra dhvaj fahraakar subhash ek vishaal morche kaa netritv kar rahe the tabhi police ne un par lathi chalaayi or unhen ghayal kar jail bhej diya
 While Subhash was in jail, Gandhiji compromised with the British government and got all the prisoners released
 lekin angrej sarkaar ne bhagat singh jaise krantikariyon ko reeha karne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Gandhiji spoke to the government to forgive Bhagat Singh's execution, but with tenderness
 subhash chaahate the ki is vishay par gandhiji angrej sarkaar ke saath kiya gaya samjhauta tod den
 But Gandhiji was not ready to break his promise
 angrej sarkaar apane sthaan par adi rahi or bhagat singh va unke saathiyon ko phaansi de di gayi
 Subhash Gandhi became very angry with Gandhi and Congress methods for not saving Bhagat Singh
 apane saarvajanik jivan main subhash ko kul 11 baar karawas hua
 First he was imprisoned for six months on 16 July 1921
 1925 main gopinath saaha naamak ek krantikari kolkata ke police adheekshak charlas tegart ko maarna chahta tha
 He accidentally killed a businessman named Ernest Day
 iske liye use phaansi kii sajaa di gayi
 Subhash wept bitterly after Gopinath was hanged
 unhone gopinath kaa shav mangekar uskaa antim sanskaar kiya
 This led the British government to conclude that Subhash not only had connections with fiery revolutionaries, but he also inspired them
 isi bahaane angrez sarkaar ne subhash ko giraftaar kiya or bina koi mukadmaa chalaaye unhen anishchit kaal ke liye myanmaar ke mandle karagrih main bandi banaakar bhej diya
 On 5 November 1925 Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das died in Kolkata
 subhash ne unki mrityu kii khabar mandle karagrih main radio par suni
 While staying at Mandalay prison, Subhash got very sick
 unhen tapedic ho gaya
 But the British government still refused to release him
 sarkaar ne unhen reeha karne ke liye yah shart rakhi ki ve ilaaj ke liye europe chale jaayen
 But the government did not clarify when they could return to India after treatment
 isliye subhash ne yah shart sweekaar nahin kii
 Eventually, the situation became so difficult that the jail authorities began to feel that they might not die in prison
 angrez sarkaar yah khatra bhi nahin uthaanaa chaahati thi ki subhash kii karagrih main mrityu ho jaye
 Therefore, the government released him
 uske baad subhash ilaaj ke liye dalhousie chale gayi
 Subhash was in imprisonment in 1930 when he was elected the Mayor of Kolkata in the elections
 isliye sarkaar unhen reeha karne par majaboor ho gayi
 Subhash was again imprisoned in 1932
 is baar unhen almoda jail main rakhaa gaya
 His health deteriorated again in Almora jail
 chikitsakon kii salaah par subhash is baar ilaaj ke liye europe jane ko raji ho gayi
 Subhash lived in Europe from 1933 to 1936
 europe main subhash ne apni sehat kaa khyaal rakhte hue apana kaary badastoor jari rakhaa
 There he met Mussolini, the leader of Italy, who pledged to assist him in India's freedom struggle
 ireland ke netaa di valera subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 The days when Subhash was in Europe, Kamala Nehru, wife of Jawaharlal Nehru, died in Austria
 subhash ne vahaan jaakar jawaharlal nehru ko santvana di
 Subhash later met Vitthal Bhai Patel in Europe
 vitthal bhai patel ke saath subhash ne mantranaa kii jise patel-bose vishleshan ke naam se prasiddhi mili
 In this analysis, both of them strongly condemned Gandhi's leadership
 uske baad vitthal bhai patel jab biimaar ho gayi to subhash ne unki bahut seva kii
 But Vitthal Bhai Patel did not survive, he died
 vitthal bhai patel ne apni vasiyat main apni sari sampatti subhash ke naam kar di
 But after his death, his brother Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did not accept this will
 sardaar patel ne is vasiyat ko lekar adaalat main mukadmaa chalaaya
 On winning this case, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel gifted all of his brother's property to the Harijan service of Gandhi
 1934 main subhash ko unke pita ke mrityushyya par hone kii khabar mili
 As soon as he heard the news, he returned to Kolkata via airplane via Karachi
 yadhyapi karachi main hi unhe pataa chal gaya tha ki unke pita kii mrittyu ho chuki he phir bhi ve kolkata gayi
 As soon as he reached Kolkata, the British government arrested him and kept him in jail for several days and sent him back to Europe
 san 1934 main jab subhash austria main apana ilaaj karaane hetu tehre hue the us samay unhen apni pustak likhane hetu ek angreji jaanane vaale typist kii aavashyaktaa hui
 a friend of his met an Austrian woman named Emily Shankel

 Subhash was attracted to Emily and the two fell in natural love
 naaji germany ke sakht kanoonon ko dekhte hue un donon ne san 1942 main bad gastin naamak sthaan par hindu paddati se vivaah rachaa liya
 Emily gave birth to a daughter in Vienna
 subhash ne use pehali baar tab dekha jab vah mushkil se chaar saptaah kii thi
 They named her Anita Bose
 agast 1945 main taiwan main hui tathakthith vimaan durghatana main jab subhash kii maut hui, anita paune teen saal kii thi
 Anita is still alive
 uskaa naam anita bose phalf he
 Anita Faf sometimes comes to India to meet her father's family
 1938 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan haripura main hona tay hua
 Prior to this session, Gandhi chose Subhash for the post of Congress President
 yah congress kaa 51 vaan adhiveshan tha
 Therefore, Congress President Subhash Chandra Bose was welcomed in a chariot drawn by 51 oxen
 is adhiveshan main subhash kaa adhyakshiya bhaashan bahut hi prabhavi hua
 Hardly any Indian political person has ever given such an effective speech
 apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main subhash ne yojana ayog kii sthapana kii
 Jawaharlal Nehru was made its first president
 subhash ne bangalore main mashhoor vaigyanik sar vishweshwarayya kii adhyakshata main ek vigyaan parishad kii sthapana bhi kii
 In 1937, Japan invaded China
 subhash kii adhyakshata main congress ne chini janata kii sahaayta ke liye dow dwarkanath kotnis ke netritv main chikitsakeey dal bhejne kaa nirnay liya
 Later, when Subhash collaborated with Japan in India's freedom struggle, many people started calling him Japanese puppet and fascist
 magar is ghatana se yah siddh hota hai ki subhash na to japan kii kathputli the or na hi ve phacist vichaardhaara se sahamat the
 In 1938, when Gandhi had chosen Subhash for the post of Congress President, he did not like Subhash's methodology
 isi dauraan europe main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke badal chaa gaye the
 Subhash wanted that India's freedom struggle should be intensified by taking advantage of this difficulty of England
 unhone apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main is ore kadam uthaanaa bhi shuru kar diya tha parantu gandhiji isse sahamat nahin the
 In 1939, when the time came to elect a new Congress president, Subhash wanted that someone who would not be bowed down under any pressure in this matter be made the president
 aisa kisi duusare vyakti ke saamne na aane par subhash ne swayan congress adhyaksh bane rahanaa chaha
 But Gandhi wanted to remove him from the post of president
 gandhi ne adhyaksh pad ke liye pattabhi sitaramaiya ko chunaa
 Kavivar Rabindranath Thakur wrote a letter to Gandhi requesting Subhash to be the president
 prafullachandra raay or meghnad saaha jaise vaigyanik bhi subhash ko hi phir se adhyaksh ke rup main dekhnaa chaahaten the
 But Gandhiji did not listen to anyone in this matter
 koi samjhauta na ho paane par bahut barason baad congress party main adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav hua
 Everyone believed that when Mahatma Gandhi supported Pattabhi Sitaramayya, then he would win the election easily
 lekin vastav main subhash ko chunaav main 1580 mat or sitaramaiyya ko 1377 mat mili
 Despite Gandhiji's opposition, Subhash Babu won the election by 203 votes
 magar chunaav ke nattejey ke saath baat khatm nahin hui
 Gandhiji, describing Pattabhi Sitaramayya's defeat as his defeat, told his comrades that if they do not agree with Subhash's methods, they can withdraw from the Congress
 iske baad congress kaaryakarini ke 14 main se 12 sadasyon ne istipha de diya
 Jawaharlal Nehru remained neutral and was alone with Sharad Babu Subhash
 1939 kaa vaarshik congress adhiveshan tripuri main hua
 At the time of this session, Subhash Babu became so ill with high fever that he had to lie down on a stretcher and bring it to the convention
 gandhiji swayan bhi is adhiveshan main upasthit nahin rahe or unke saathiyon ne bhi subhash ko koi sahyog nahin diya
 After the session, Subhash tried hard for a settlement, but Gandhiji and his colleagues did not accept him
 paristhiti aisi ban gayi ki subhash kuch kaam hi na kar paye
 Finally fed up, on 29 April 1939, Subhash resigned as Congress President
 3 may 1939 ko subhash ne congress ke andar hi forward block ke naam se apni party kii sthapana kii
 a few days later Subhash was expelled from the Congress
 baad main forward block apane aap ek swatantra party ban gayi
 Even before the start of the Second World War, the Forward Bloc started public awakening to intensify the freedom struggle
 3 sitambar 1939 ko madras main subhash ko britain or germany main yuddh chhidane kii soochna mili
 He announced that now that India has a golden opportunity, it should intensify its campaign for liberation
 8 sitambar 1939 ko yuddh ke prati party kaa rukh tay karne ke liye subhash ko vishesh aamantrit ke rup main congress kaary samiti main bulaayaa gaya
 He also reiterated with his opinion that if the Congress cannot do this work, the forward block will start a war against the British Raj on its own
 agle hi varsh july main kalakatta sthit halwat stambh jo bharat kii gulaami kaa pratik tha subhash kii youth brigade ne ratorat vah stambh mitti main mila diya
 Subhash's volunteers uprooted each brick of his foundation
 yah ek pratikatmak shuruyaat thi
 Through this, Subhash had given the message that as he has mixed this column in the dust, in the same way, he will also play brick by brick of the British Empire
 iske parinamswaroop angrej sarkaar ne subhash sahit forward block ke sabhi mukhya netaaon ko kaid kar liya
 Subhash did not want to remain in jail during World War II
 sarkaar ko unhen reeha karne par majaboor karne ke liye subhash ne jail main aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 The government released him as soon as his condition deteriorated
 magar angrej sarkaar yah bhi nahin chaahati thi ki subhash yuddh ke dauraan mukt rahen
 That is why the government detained him at his own house and kept him vigilant outside the police
 najarbandi se nikalne ke liye subhash ne ek yojana banaayi
 On 16 January 1941, he escaped from his house disguised as a Pathan, Mohammed Ziauddin, dodging the police
 sharadbabu ke bade bete shishir ne unhe apni gaadi se kolkata se dur gomoh tak pahunchaaya
 They reached Peshawar after catching a frontier mail from Gomoh railway station
 peshawar main unhen forward block ke ek sahakaari, miyaan akbar shah mili
 Mian Akbar Shah met him with Bhagatram Talwar of Kirti Kisan Party
 bhagatraam talwaar ke saath subhash peshawar se afghanistan kii rajdhani kabul kii ore nikal pade
 In this journey, Pathan and Subhash named Bhagatram Talwar Rahmat Khan became his deaf and dumb deaf
 pahadiyon main paidal chalate hue unhone yah safar puraa kiya
 Subhash lived in Kabul for two months in the house of an Indian businessman named Uttamchand Malhotra
 vahaan unhone pehle roosi duutavas main pravesh paanaa chaha
 Failing this, he tried to gain entry into the German and Italian embassies
 italian duutavas main unki koshish safal rahi
 The German and Italian embassies assisted him
 aakhir main arlando mazonta naamak italian vyakti banakar subhash kabul se nikalakar rus kii rajdhani masco hote hue germany kii rajdhani berlin pahunche
 In Berlin, Subhash first met other German leaders such as Rieben Trope
 unhone germany main bhartiya swatantrata sanghathan or azaad hind radio kii sthapana kii
 Meanwhile, Subhash came to be known as Netaji
 german sarkaar ke ek mantri adam phon trot subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 Finally, on 29 May 1942, Subhash met Adolf Hitler, the supreme leader of Germany
 lekin hitler ko bharat ke vishay main vishesh ruchi nahin thi
 He did not give any clear promise of help to Subhash
 kai saal pehle hitler ne min kamff naamak aatmcharitra likhaa tha
 In this book, he had done evil to India and Indian people
 is vishay par subhaashane hitler se apni naaraazgi vyakt kii
 Hitler apologized for his actions and pledged to remove that passage in the next edition of Mayne Kampf
 ant main subhash ko pataa laga ki hitler or germany se unhen kuch or nahin milane vaala he
 Therefore, on 8 March 1943, he set out in East Kiel in a German submarine with his partner Abid Hasan Safrani in Kiel Port, Germany
 vah german pandubbi unhen hind mahaasaagar main madagascar ke kinare tak lekar gayi
 There they both swam in the sea and reached the Japanese submarine
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay kinhin bhi do deshon kii nausenaon kii pandubbiyon ke dwaara nagarikon kii yah ekmaatr adla-badali hui thi
 This Japanese submarine brought them to Padang Port in Indonesia
 purvi asia pahunchakar subhash ne sarvapratham vayovruddh krantikari rasbihari bose se bhartiya swatantrata parishad kaa netritv sanbhaala
 Rasbihari voluntarily handed over the leadership of the Freedom Council to Subhash in Singapore's Edward Park
 japan ke pradhanmantri general hideki tojo ne netaji ke vyaktitv se prabhavit hokar unhen sahyog karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 Several days later Netaji gave a speech in front of the Parliament of Japan
 21 oktober 1943 ke din netaji ne singapore main arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind kii sthapana kii
 He himself became the President, Prime Minister and War Minister of this government
 is sarkaar ko kul nau deshon ne manyata di
 Netaji also became the chief commander of the Azad Hind Fauj
 azaad hind fouj main japani sena ne angrejon kii fouj se pakade hue bhartiya yudhbandiyon ko bhartee kiya tha
 The Rani Regiment of Jhansi was also formed for women in Azad Hind Fauj
 purvi asia main netaji ne anek bhaashan dekar vahaan ke sthaayee bhartiya logon se azaad hind fouj main bhartee hone or use aarthik madad dene kaa aavahan kiya
 He also gave this message in his call - "you give me blood, i will give you freedom
" " During the second world war, with the support of the Japanese army the Azad Hind Fauj attacked indian colonial govt
 apni fouj ko prerit karne ke liye netaji ne " dilli chalo" kaa naaraa diya
 Both the forces won the Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British
 yah dweep arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind ke anushaasan main rahe
 Netaji renamed these islands "shaheed Island" and "swaraj Island"
 donon phujon ne milakar imphal or kohima par akraman kiya
 But later the British got the upper hand and both the troops had to retreat
 jab azaad hind fouj peeche hat rahi thi tab japani sena ne netaji ke bhaag jane kii vyavastha kii
 But Netaji preferred to walk hundreds of miles with the girls of Rani Regiment of Jhansi
 is prakaar netaji ne sachche netritv kaa ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Addressing Gandhiji through his speech on Azad Hind Radio on 6 July 1944, Netaji explained his reason for seeking help from Japan and the purpose of establishing the army-hukumate-azad-hind and Azad Hind Fauj
 is bhaashan ke dauraan netaji ne gandhiji ko rashtrapita kaha tabhi gandhiji ne bhi unhe netaji kaha
 After Japan's defeat in World War II, Netaji needed to find a new path
 unhone rus se sahaayta maangane kaa nishchay kiya tha
 On 18 August 1945, Netaji was on his way to Manchuria by airplane
 is safar ke dauraan ve laapata ho gayi
 After this day, they were never shown to anyone
 23 agast 1945 ko tokio radio ne bataaya ki sagon main netaji ek bade bamavarshak vimaan se aa rahe the ki 18 agast ko taihoku hawaii adde ke paas unka vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya
 Japanese general Shodei, Pilate, and some others aboard the plane were killed
 netaji gambheer rup se jal gayi the
 He was rushed to Taihoku military hospital where he succumbed
 karnal habiburrahman ke anusaar unka antim sanskaar taihoku main hi kar diya gaya
 In mid-september, their bones were collected and placed in the Rankoji temple of Tokyo, the capital of Japan
 bhartiya rashtriya abhilekhaagaar se praapt dastauez ke anusaar netaji kii mrityu 18 agast 1945 ko taihoku ke sainik aspataal main raatri 21
00 baje hui thi
 After independence, the Government of India appointed the Commission twice in 1956 and 1977 to investigate this incident
 donon baar yah nateeja niklaa ki netaji us vimaan durghatana main hi maare gayi
 But these two commissions did not talk to the Taiwanese government on the land of Taiwan where the accident happened
 1999 main manoj kumaar mukherjee ke netritv main teesraa ayog banaaya gaya
 In 2005, the Taiwan government told the Mukherjee Commission that no airplane had crashed on Taiwan land in 1945
 2005 main mukherjee ayog ne bharat sarkaar ko apni report pesh kii jisamen unhone kaha ki netaji kii mrityu us vimaan durghatana main hone kaa koi saboot nahin hai
 But the Government of India rejected the Mukherjee Commission report
 18 agast 1945 ke din netaji kahan laapata ho gayi or unka aage kya hua yah bhartiya itihaas kaa sabase bada anuttarit rahasy ban gaya hai
 Even today, there is no dearth of people claiming to see and meet Netaji in different parts of the country
 faijabad ke gumnami baba se lekar chhattisgarh rajya main jila raigarh tak main netaji ke hone ko lekar kai daawey pesh kiye gayi lekin in sabhi kii pramanikta sandigdh he
 In Chhattisgarh, the case of Subhash Chandra Bose went to the state government
 parantu rajya sarkaar ne ise hastkshep ke yogya na maanate hue maamle kii file hi band kar di
 The Calcutta High Court has ordered the formation of a special bench to hear the demand to make the intelligence documents related to the mystery of Netaji's disappearance public
 yah yachika sarkari sanghathan indiaj smil dwaara daayar kii gayi he
 Many others including the Union of India, National Advisory Council, RAW, Intelligence Department, Prime Minister's Private Secretary, Defense Secretary, Home Department and the Government of West Bengal have been made defendants in this petition
 hiroshima or nagasaki ke vidhwans ke baad saare sandarbh hi badal gayi

 yahi kaaran tha ki netaji or aaazaad hind sena kaa romaharshak itihaas tokio ke abhilekhaagaar main varshon tak padaa dhul khaataa rahaa
 The trial of Azad Hind Fauj at Red Fort, Delhi in November 1945 led to an indescribable increase in Netaji's fame and he reached the peak of popularity

 nausena vidroh ke baad hi britain ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ab bhartiya sena ke bal par bharat main shashan nahin kiya ja saktaa or bharat ko swatantra karne ke alaava unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa
 Except for the Azad Hind Fauj, there is no such instance in world history where thirty-thirty thousand war prisoners have organized and waged such a strong struggle for the independence of their country

 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has naturally been keen on writing in spite of his struggling and extremely busy life
 apni apurna aatmakatha ek bhartiya yatri ke atirikt unhone do khandon main ek puri pustak bhi likhi bharat kaa sangharsh, jiskaa landan se hi pratham prakaashan hua tha

 Apart from this, Netaji wrote numberless letters in the context of his multi-dimensional freedom struggle, gave speeches and his lectures were also broadcast through radio
 patron kii ek badi maatra unke nijee jivan se bhi sambaddh he
 From December 1940 till the last time of Netaji, his full confidant and close associate Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose established the Netaji Research Bureau and started the massive work of publishing Netaji's 'samagra Sahitya' mainly in association with Vinod C
 Chaudhary in 1961 AD
 And in 1980, the work of compilation of 12 volumes of compositions began
 aarambhik yojana 10 khandon main 'samgr sahitya' ke prakaashan kii thi, parantu baad main yah yojana 12 khandon kii ho gayi

 In the first volume of this 'composite Society', some papers have been published along with his 'autobiography' and in the second volume his famous book 'struggle of India' has been published
 phir anya khandon main unke dwaara likhit patron, tippaniyon evam bhaashanon aadi samgr uplabdh sahitya kaa krambaddh prakaashan hua he
 In this way, as much as possible, written and textual reading of Netaji has become accessible for 'overall speech' study and it is an age-old requirement that like Mahatma Gandhi, in the context of Netaji too, to form an opinion based on many contextual statements and incomplete information
 Instead of looking at the appropriate issue in its appropriate and appropriate contexts, accurate and authentic opinion should be formed

 Most authors and thinkers also agree that ethics is primarily concerned with norms and values, not the study or discovery of objects and these criteria should be used not only in the analysis of personal life but in the analysis of social life

 purv main vibhinn naitik drushtikon or kabhi-kabhi to paraspar virdohi drushtikon bhi, saath-saath viksit hote rahe
 Therefore, it would be convenient to study the history of ethics separately in East and West

 Practical scriptures give direction in India

 The biggest hindrance to this path is that karmas have enlivened the soul with its roots
 jis tarah badalon main suryakiranon kaa prakaash mand ho jaataa he, vaise hi "pudgal" yaa jad tatv ke parmaanu jeev ke chaitanya ko apavitra kar dete hai

 hindu darshan ke sabhi sampradaayon ne, jahaan tak aacharanshastra kaa sambandh he, upanishdon or bhagavadgita ke mukhya sinddhanton ko sweekaar kiya he
 While the Upanishads have raised the deep question of the supreme element on the one hand and considered Brahm Gyan to be the aimless goal of philosophy, on the other hand they have also paid attention to the practical aspect of self-respect and "modesty"

 The Vaishnava tradition, which drew inspiration from the path of devotion, had more influence on the Indian ethos of the medieval period than Advaita Vedanta
 islam ke sufi mat se is pravriti ko bal mila
 In a broader sense it can be said that medieval ethics, whose reflection is more clearly found in santakavya than philosophical texts, is humanism
 aadhunik kaal main gandhivaad main bhartiya achaarshastra kii sabhi swasth paramparaon kaa samanvay miltaa he
 The spirituality of the Upanishads, the "ahimsa" of Jaino, the compassion and love of the Buddha, the Karmayoga of the Gita, the cosmopolitanism of Islam, all have a place in Gandhism
 or chunki in aadarshon ko rashtriya mahatma gandhi kaa achaarshastra, deshkalathit samasyaon ko uthaate hue bhi, bhartiya samskruti mulyon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Ethics is difficult to study in all ancient civilizations distinct from philosophy and theology, but this difficulty is more acute in the cultural history of the eastern world than in the western world
 china ke darshanik, dharmik, naitik, saanskrithik mulyon ke do aadi strot hai : "taowad or kalphucheevaad"
 Despite their mutual opposition, the coordination of these two, directly or indirectly, has been the goal of Chinese thinkers

 According to laotse-tao, it is "auspicious" to reconcile with nature

 Man should make his life natural and pure

 Kalfushas - Confucius's approach is fundamentally different from this
 iske anusaar jivan kii purnatam sadhana hi manushya kaa kartavya he
 He has to perform this duty only as a member of society
 kaarysiddhi or purusharth hi vaastavik "shubh" he

 arastu ke "sunahare madhyam maarg" kii tarah kanfushas kaa achaarshastra bhi atirekavirohi he
 Mencius - The ethics of Mencius is based on the principle of Confucius, but there is more emphasis on humanism than social welfare
 anek chini darshanik "tao" ke rahasyavaad or ativyaktvaad se bhi asantusht the or kanfushas ke paramparapradhan, aupchaarik upadeshon se bhi
 Hence the emergence of many such creeds who either took the path of compromise or created a new ethos about a particular aspect of life
 udhaahranswaroop "motsu" kaa panth upyogetavaadi tha
 The criterion of good conduct is "maximum use", but the means is love or friendship
 sangharsh isliye aniatik he ki vah anupayagi or "apvyayshil" ban jaataa he
 The "fascia" cult took ethics closer to politics and said that ethics can be protected only by state and legislation
 "tao" or kanfushaswad kaa samanvay karaane kaa utkar prayaas "yin--yaang" sinddhant main dekha ja saktaa he
 Two powers in the world work continuously - "yang", which is active, positive, "masculine" and "yin", which is passive, negative, "feminine"
 prayek vastu, sanstha or sambandh main e donon hi pravritiyaan pratibimbit hai
 Their proper amount is actually an "auspicious" situation
 or aisi paristhiti ke nirmaan main haath bataana maanav kaa kartavya he
 There is a clear impression of Buddhist ideas on medieval Chinese ethics
 therwaad kii apeksha mahayan kaa or visheshat: madhyamik darshan kaa, china main adhik teji se vikaas hua
 But by bringing Nagarjuna's "nihilism" into the mold of traditional "pragmatism", Chinese thinkers gave Buddhist philosophy a new direction
 is nae darshan kaa naaraa he : "samgr main ek or ek main samgr"
 The Ming era has clear signs of skepticism and hyperphysicalism in the 12th and 13th century ethos, but after the "ming" era cultural resurgence, Chinese ideology again turned to rationalism
 tab se aadhunik yug tak china kaa achaardarshan mukhya rup se buddhivaadee hi rahaa he
 In Zoroastrianism, ethics have been given a very important place
 swayan zarathustra ke vishay main nishchit rup se kuch kam kaha ja saktaa he
 In "gathas" his personality seems historical, but in "avesta" he becomes fictional mythological
 zarathustradharm mukhyat: dwaitvaadi he
 In "avesta", "ahur" is accepted as the only paramount authority and it is said that the expression of "ahur" occurs in two directions
 ek ore aalaak he, duusari ore andhkaar; ek ore jad bhautik vastu, duusari ore aadhyatm
 But the unity of "ahur" is only formal
 maani -aage chalakar maani ne khule aam jurathustravaad ko purnataya dwaitvaadi bana diya
 According to him, the material object is an independent power whose constant struggle with spiritual power goes on

pus
 7veen shatabdi se hi yunaan main darshan kii swasth paramparaayen ban chuki thim, parantu protagoras ke pehle vichaarkon ne mukhyat: bahya jagat par hi dhyaan diya tha
 All philosophers from the Thalis to Anaxagoras continued to search for the existence of the world
 sofistapanthiyon ne darshan ke lakshya kaa punarmulayankan kiya tathaa maanav jivan kii pratyaksh samasyaon ko darshanik drushti se aankane kaa ytn kiya
 Protagoras - "man is the test of everything" - This statement of Protagoras reflects both the good and the bad parts of Sophist ethics
 jahaan ek ore is kathan se achaarshastra thos samasyaon kii ore jhukta he vahaan duusari ore vah vyaktigat or saapeksh bhi ban jaataa he
 Protagoras 'humanism resulted from giorgius-gorges' interaction, and this skepticism, on a philosophical level, gave rise to surrealism and hedonism
 sucraat -in vikrutiyon ke viruddh sucraat ne sarvapratham ek aise achaarshastra kaa nirmaan kiya jo adarshavaadi hote hue bhi yatharth paristhitiyon par aadhaarit tha
 Socrates' approach is rational
 "gyaan hi sadachaar he"
 One who has real knowledge of proper deeds, his behavior has to be correct; And the culmination of ignorance is equally important to be in misconduct
 sofistapanthi "nyaay", "niyam", "sanyam" aadi shabdon kaa prayog avashya karte the, par inaki sookshm vyakhya unhone kabhi nahin kii
 Socrates emphasized that the basis of individual moral ideals is knowledge
 jo antar "gyaan" or "jaankaree" main he, vahi niyambaddh achaarshastra or prathajanya naitik dharanaon main he
 The goal of all is the same --- "goodness"
 parantu gyaan dwaara hi "bhalaai" or paramshubh main saamanjasy sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 And the social form of this harmony can be found only in such a state where the rulers consider an art of good life and try to assimilate it
 afalaatoon -sucraat ke udaatt adarshavaad ke prati sachhee nishtha baratate hue afalaatoon plato ne unke upadeshon ko parishkrut rup main rakhaa or unhen darshanik matvaad kaa sahaara diya
 One aspect of Aflatun's ethics is purely elemental
 bhautik jagat kii vastuon kii tathakthith "satta" chaaya maatr he
 Real power is only for expressions or efforts, because suffixes are continual and standalone
 inamen sabase shuddh or ucch shrenee kaa praytn he "shubh"
 In this way the basis of virtue is the auspiciousness of Adisatta
 lekin afalaatoon ke achaardarshan kaa ek doosraa, yathartwaadee paksh bhi he
 a subtle analysis of human nature is found in it
 maanav swabhaav ke-afalaatoon ke shabdon main maanav "aatma" ke-teen vibhaag hai
 They are governed by desire, emotion and intelligence
 pehle do vibhaagon par tisare kaa prabhutv hi sadachaar kaa aadhaar he
 a person not only has a human tendency, that is, rationality, but he also has "animalistic" and "vegetative" tendencies that prevent him from rising above the biological and somatic level
 buddhi kaa uddeshy in pravritiyon kaa vinaash nahin, unka shashan or niyantran he
 The correct interpretation of this objective can only be done at the social level and not at the individual level
 samaaj main maanav swabhaav ke teen angon ke anuroop teen varg hai-shramik, yoddha or shaasha
 This class division is natural and the imagination of a classless society is not justified, because the basis of justice is ultimately natural law
 adarsh vyavastha vah he jisamen prayek varg ke log apane-apane sadgunon kii sadhana karte rahen
 The rulers should be prudent, warriors brave and laboring hardworking and humble
 e sadgun paraspar poorak hai or inkaa uchit maatra main prayog hi "naitik paristhiti" he
 Ultimately, such a situation depends only on the people of the third class, because only the intellect can control the voluntary and emotional tendencies
 shaasha varg kaa drushtikon purnataya darshanik, buddhivaadee hona chahie or iske liye uchit shikshapranali nitant aavashyak he
 Aristotle - The culmination of the Socratic tradition is found in Aristotle's ethics
 arestu ne vishleshan or prayog karte hue aacharan ke vibhinn pahaluon kii vaigyanik dhang se samiksha kii
 The development of ethics as an independent "scripture" begins with Aristotle's "naikomekian Ethics"
 arestu ke anusaar "shubh" kii abhivyakti do dishaao main hoti he
 The first direction is that in which, through practice and effort, the human brings his lower tendencies under the control of the supernatural power - that is, the intellect
 is prayaas ke falswaroop jin sadgunon kii sristi hoti he ve hai "naitik sadgun"
 But there is also another means of auspiciousness - that is, pure wisdom by intellect or the search for extreme truth
 is gyaan or manan se "bauddhik sadgunon" kii sristi hoti he
 An ideal life is a life of contemplation
 
 But the direct relation of ethics is more intimate with moral virtues than intellectual virtues
 naitik gunon kaa aadhaar he madhyam maarg kaa siddhant
 Redundancy on the one hand and absence on the other, morality is possible only by avoiding both these errors
 udhaahranswaroop, "saahas" ek naitik sadgun he
 Its redundancy is "heedless" and its inferiority is "cowardice"
 isi tarah prayek naitik sadgun kii seemayen sthir kii ja sakati hai
 After erispitpus-aristotle, the stream of Greek ethics divided into two opposing directions
 ek ore epicuras ne sukhwad ko or duusari ore jeenon ne sanyasawad ko adarsh ke rup main saamne rakhaa
 In fact, both of these seeds were planted in Socrates era itself
 epicuras ke sukhwad kaa mul strot he "sirenik" achaardarshan or zino kaa "stoik" pranali kaa aadhaar he "sinic" panth kaa sukhwadavirohi darshan
 The originator of the Cyrenaic sect was Aristippus, and the Cynic cult was founded by Antisthenes, a disciple of Socrates
 epicuras -epicureey achaarshastra gyaan or vivek ko saadhan maatr samajhakar santosh yaa samaadhaan ko jivan kaa lakshya maanata he
 Stretches of happiness and the exclusion of grief are natural tendencies
 "sireneik" drushtikon mulat: uchit tha, parantu usamen sukh kii vyakhya sankeern he
 It is foolish to consider only momentary happiness as everything
 hamaara dhey jivan ko samgr rup se sukhmay bananaa he
 Specific pleasures sometimes have to be discarded in this action
 sukhon kii tivrata keval ek paksh he, unke sthayitv par bhi dhyaan dena he
 Mental peace is more pleasing than physical will, because it can keep us satisfied for longer
 sarvocch sadgun "saavdhaanee" he, kyonki vah ek seemaa tak hamen du:kha dard se bachaata he
 The doctrine of zino-stoicism stands in sharp contrast
 zino ke anusaar vivek hi sarvasv he
 Happiness has no place in its place, although even if happiness is found in a rational career, it is not necessary to forcefully reject it, as the "cynicists" used to do
 samvedjanya sukhon ko gaun or tuchh samajhnaa kaaphi he
 "life according to nature" means rational life, because conscious, actionable discretion is "natural" for humans
 sadachaar kaa aadhaar he aatmaniyantran, kartavyaparayanata or swaarthtyag
 The biggest obstacle in the path of moral development is incontinence
 "stike" vichaardhaara main sanyasavritti kaaphi prabal hote hue bhi zino or uske anuyaayiyon ne "sinic" panth ke vikrut vyaktvaad se bachane kaa bhi yathesht praytn kiya
 The Stoic ethos had a profound effect on medieval values
 seneka or samrat macrs orilliyas ne is darshan kaa samarthan kiya
 Plotinus - The medieval ethos is mainly religious or spiritualist
 roman samrajya ke patan se pehle hi isai dharmatatv ke sandarbh main greek darshan kaa punarmoolyankan kiya jane laga tha
 The first such significant effort can be seen in neo-colonialism
 sucraat--afalaatoon--arestu kii vichaarparampara main jo rahasywaadee pravritiyaan nihit thim unhen plotinus ke darshan main ubhaara gaya he
 The ultimate aim of human life is the unbroken knowledge of "one" or "divine"
 is uddeshy kii purti ke liye hamen apane aapako "yogya" bananaa he or iske liye sadachaar aavashyak he
 Thus the importance of ethos for Plotinus is limited and facetious
 nakeelatunavaad ke anya pramukh pratinidhi hai filo or poraphiri
 Agastin -sant Agastin's "patriotic" philosophy also considers the divine experience as the ultimate goal
 ishwarprem hi vaastavik naitikta kaa aadhaar ho saktaa he
 Agastin indirectly accepted the doctrine of hedonism to a certain extent, saying that "maximum will" is possible only in theocratic life
 thomas ekwines -madhyayugin achaardarshan kaa sabase viksit rup sant thomas ekwines kii darshanapranali main he
 Equinus sought to move Christianity from Aflatoonism to Aristotleism
 satya or shubh kaa anusandhan do bhaagon se sabhav he-vishwaas or vivek
 These two are independent, but there is no fundamental opposition to them
 viveshkti kii ucchtam safalataa he arestudarshan
 The most sublime accomplishment of "faith" is the "genuine spiritualism" of Jesus Christ

 The independent existence of ethics almost ceased, and the discussion of moral questions remained confined to literal discourse in some of the dogmatic problems of Christian theology
 achaarshastra kaa aadhunik yug 15veen 16veen shatabdiyon ke dharmanirpeksh darshan se aarambh hota he
 One aspect of this philosophy is the scientist and naturalist whose healthy form is reflected in the bacon and distorted form of habz
 achaarshastra kii drushti se habz bekan se adhik mahatvapurn he
 Habz's approach is materialistic
 vastuon or gati kaa hi astitv vah maanata he or maanav aacharan ko "vastu" or "gati" ke hi daayre main dekhtaa he
 Since human relation to object is possible only through sensing, therefore sensing is the "main driver" of human life
 sukh kii ichha or du:kha ke prati vimukhataa hi maanviya vyavhaar kaa aadhaar he
 The duty of a person is only one - to earn happiness for oneself
 swarthparata swaabhaavik he, swaarthtyag kritrim
 The basis of social organization is "each person's fear of every other person"
 sukhon ko vartmaan kii tarah bhavishya main bhi praapt karne ke liye "adhikaar" or "shakti" aavashyak hai
 Therefore, authority is also natural and directs conduct
 vyavhaar kaa aantarik maandand swaarth he, bahya maandand rajkeey athwa saamaajik adhikaar he
 It was imperative to have a sharp reaction against Habs' selfish idealism
 yah pratikriya "sahajagyanvaadee aacharanshastra" main vyakt hui
 The main representatives of this trend are Clarke, Cudworth, Shaftsbury, Hutchinson and Butler
 inamen aapasi matbhed hote hue bhi vyapak rup se is baat par sahmati he ki naitik niyam "swat:siddh satya" he
 Shaftsbury put forward the principle of "moral discretion" in ethics for the first time
 butler kaa kahana he ki naitik niyamon kaa sahaj gyaan isliye sambhav he ki prakruti ne-yaa "ishwar" ne-is prakaar ke gyaan ke liye hamen ek vishesh saadhan pradaan kiya he
 Butler calls this instrument "member's discretion

 kaant ne purvavarti vichaarkon ke ekangi siddhanton ko santulit rup dekar unhen ek samanvyatmak aacharandarshan main sutarabaddh karne kaa praytn kiya
 "duty" and "selfishness" are both completely different motives
 inamen se kartavya ko hi pradhan maanakar jivan sangathit kiya jaae to adhiktam kalyansampadan kiya ja saktaa he
 The interpretation of duty is possible only by "auspicious resolution"
 shubh sankalp hi ekmaatr aisa shubh he jiskaa mulya nirpeksh he
 All other "good", such as happiness, merit, convenience, etc
 are relative
 unka mahatv yaheen tak simit he ki shubh sankalp ko kriyman banane main unase sahaayta mil sakati he
 Kant emphasized that moral rules are universal and absolutely mandatory
 prayek paristhiti main or prayek vyakti ke prati vah lagu hota he
 This rule mandates that we accept humanity as a means and not as a means, always in ourselves and others
 naitik kartavya ko kisi bhi bahya dabaav kii utpatti samajhnaa galat he, chaahe vah bahya shakti "ishwar" ho yaa "sukhvardhak" paristhiti
 The rule under which a wild person is subjected is the discretion of the person himself
 fishte kaa aacharanshastra atibuddhivaadee he
 He considers the person independent, but according to him the freedom of conduct is dependent on knowledge
 kaant kii bhul yah thi ki usne vivek ke saidhantik or vyaavhaarik angon ke bich virodh khadaa kiya

 Taking inspiration from Darwin's "law of Natural Election", Herbert Spencer introduced a new developmental hedonism
 jivan kaa aadhaar he vyakti kaa parivesh se safal anukalan 
 This law is as real to humans as it is to other beings, although social and cultural traditions have formed in human life
 "safal anukalan" kaa lakshan he ek aise pragatisheel samaaj kaa sanghathan jisamen vyaktigat sukhon kaa laabh samgr jati ke kalyansampadan se sanlagn ho
 Bentham and Mill have a clear influence of "utilitarianism" on Spencer's hedonism
 mil kaa darshan us shashakt "anubhavvaadi" parampara par aadhaarit he jisaki buniyaad bekanâ€”habz--hum ne rakhi thi
 Bentham's famous sutra "became a tool of higher utilitarianism by the mill's contact
 mil ne is baat par jor diya tha ki jivan ke saanskrithik or bauddhik mulyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue hi "sukh" kii vyakhya kerani chahie
 Kant's humanism and Lilliam James's direct consequentialism are important in the vision of the history of ethics among other ideologies that have given rise to "utility"
 kaant ne maanav itihaas ko teen yugon main vibhajit kiya-dharmik, darshanik or vaigyanik
 The last of these, that is, the scientific age itself, is actually "positive"
 isi yug main maanav kendrit aacharanshastra kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he
 The religion of the future will be "humanity religion" in which moral, religious and other aspects will be guided by sociology
 maanavtaa ekmaatr aradhy vastu hogi or jatikalyaan hi vyavhaar kaa maandand hoga
 In such a situation, the merging of ethics into sociology is mandatory
 wiliam james ne europe kii bhavvaadi darshanik parampara kaa virodh kiya
 The search for truth on a purely elemental level is futile

 praaniyon ke "sukh kaalpanik or kshanik hai, unase lalayit hokar "sakalp" or bhi teji jeevanadhaara ko aage badhaata he or is tarah or adhik klesh utpann hote hai
 Although the existence of mere living is sad, but in human life, this affliction reaches its peak
 shaareerik ksht ke alaava ab maansik vednaa kaa bhi pradurbhaav hota he
 The sarcasm of conductology is to convince the human being that the destruction of one's life can only end his grief
 iske liye jivan ke sabhi tathakthith sukhmay anubhavon ko thukraana hoga or sabase pehle us "sukh" ko jiske kaaran maanav jati kaayam he
 The primitiveness of man is that he takes birth
 nikloi hartman kaa nirashavad shopenhavar se bhi ekadam aage hai
 Where Schopenhaver states the duty of a person to destroy his life-style, Hartmann demands that we should give yoga to end the life force of the whole world
 nitshe kaa achaarshastra bhi paramparaagat naitik manyataon ko thukraata he
 Nietzsche's theory is "valuation of values"
 uski shikaayat he ki isai dharm se prerit hokar jo naitik siddhant saamne aae hai ve durbalon ke liye hai, balavaanon ke liye nahin
 Such ethics is the "ethics of compassion"
 vastav main keval ek mulya aisa he jisapar maanav garv kar saktaa he-shakti
 Whatever is the spread of power is justified, and the deeds with which the importance of power decreases are sacrificial

 In fact, human nature is variable and moral rules also cannot be unchanging

 Since the fall of the prehistoric "clan society", there has been a continuous class struggle in moral values

 Ethics has been neglected in comparison to some other parts of philosophy in the 20th century
 achaarshastra kii koi nai pranali idhar prastut nahin kii gai
 This does not mean that philosophers have considered questions as secondary
 kroche, bergasaan, rasel or anya aadhunik darshanikon ne naitik nirnay ke swaroop ko apane drushtikon se samajhane kaa ytn kiya he
 But today, thinkers who consider "subhashubhavi Vivek" as an independent science subject are no more
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki achaarshastra par vibhinn dishaao se dabaav pad rahaa he--samajashaastra kii ore se or manovigyaan kii ore se
 On the one hand, the increasing complexity of social life forces us to look at the moral aspect of conduct in the context of political, economic and cultural problems
 duusari ore frydwad ne maanav man kii jin achetar kriyaaon kii ore dhyaan dilaayaa he unki samiksha bhi aavashyak ho gai he
 The "pure moral evaluation" of conduct has become difficult, because behind the moral assumptions, there is now some unconscious power to be understood

 Asked by his father Raja Nabhag, Ambarish replied that these godowns belonged to the devotees of God and should always be open for them

 What appears to be the present Amer fort is built on the remnants of the old fort under the rule of King Mansingh, the Kachwaha of Amer
 maansingh ke banawaaye mahal kaa acha vistaar unke vanshaj jai singh pratham dwaara kiya gaya
 In the next 150 years, a lot of reforms and expansion were done in the Amber fort by the Kachhwaha Rajput kings and finally in 1727 during the reign of Sawai Jai Singh II, they shifted their capital to Navarchit Jaipur city
 itihaaskaar james tod ke anusaar is kshetra ko pehle khogong naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Then there was the rule of Meena king Ralun Singh, also known as Alan Singh Chanda
 vah bahut hi nek evam acha raja tha
 He adopted a helpless and homeless Rajput mother and her son, seeking asylum

 That is why the history of Amer is indelibly linked to these rulers, because they established their empire here
 meenaon ke samay ke madhyakaal ke bahut se nirmaan yaa to dhwans kar diye gaye yaa unke sthaan par aaj koi anya nirmaan kiya hua he
 However, the 16th century Amer fort and the palace complex that was built by the Rajput Maharajas is well preserved

 This gate was facing east and the rays of the rising sun would enter the fort, so it was called Suraj Pol

 Jaleb Chowk is an Arabic word which means place of gathering of soldiers

 The main entrance of the temple has a pair of silver letter-studded doors

 raja ne 1604 main vijay milane par us shila ko sagar se nikalwakar amer main devi kii murti ubharavayi tathaa yahaan sthapana karavaayi thi
 Due to this idol being found in Shila form, its name was read as Shila Mata
 mandir ke praveshdwar ke upar ganesh kii muunge kii ekashm murti bhi sthapit he
 According to another legend, after the king of Jessore was defeated by Raja Man Singh, this Shyam shila was presented which is related to Mahabharata
 mahabharat main krishna ke mamaa mathura ke raja kansa ne krishna ke pehle 7 bhai bahanon ko isi shila par maaraa tha
 In lieu of this rock, Raja Man Singh returned the territory of Jessore to the defeated King of Bengal
