 This FAP typically lasts for 24 hours after being hit by a wall and the throughput of a user is restored to the tire regardless of the tier for which they paid
 isse, bandwidth-gahan gatividhiyon ko ek uchit samyavadhi main puraa karnaa lagbhag asambhav ho jaataa he 
 In the European astra2connect system, FAP is based on a monthly data limit of 2gbyte downloaded and if the limit is exceeded the download data rate is reduced for the remainder of the month
 anya satellite internet peshkashon main, sliding time vindos par aadhaarit unnat FAP tantra he
 This case, for example, lasts several days and weeks for Twoway Service which confirms the download quota during the last hours
 uddeshy he, maheene ke ant ke liye khand bachaate hue, aavashyaktaa padane par asthaayee atyadhik downlod kii anumati dena

 Benefit haani Cellular phone towers are very wide and with cellular networks stepping into third generation networks, they can support fast data using technologies such as EVDO, HSDPA and UMTS
 isse internet ke liye broadband abhigam kii anumati, cellphone dwaara, cardbas dwaara, exprescard dwaara, yaa USB cellular modem dwaara milti he, yaa cellular broadband router dwaara bhi jo sirf ek cellular conection ke istemaal se ek se adhik computer ko internet se judane kii anumati detaa he
 This service, which is still in its infancy, may eventually allow transmission of broadband Internet data from a standard high-voltage power line
 haalanki, is pranali main kai jatil mudde hai, praathmik yah he ki vidyut line aatanrik rup se ek bahut shor bharaa vaataavaran hoti hai
 Each time a device is turned on or off, it produces a pop or click in the line
 urja kii bachat karne vaale upkaran, line main aksar kolahalapurna samaswar pesh karte hai
 The system should be designed to deal with and work around these natural signal barriers
 broadband over power line, jinhen power line communication bhi kha jaataa he, america kii tulana main europe main tezi se viksit hui he jisaki vajah he vidyut pranali ke dizine darshan main ek aitihaasik antar
 lagbhag sabhi bade vidyut grid, sancharan nuksaan ko kam karne ke liye ucch voltage par vidyut sanchaarit karte hai or phir graahak ke nikat voltage ko kam karne ke liye step-down transformar kaa upyog karte hai
 Since BPL signals cannot pass immediately through the transformer, it will be necessary to connect the repeater to the transformer
 america main, yah aam he ki ek chote se upyogita pole se latakta transformar, ek ekal ghar ko apni seva data he
 In Europe, it is common to service 10 or 100 homes by a relatively large transformer
 graahakon ko bijli dene ke liye, dizine main yah antar thodaa fark daalata he, lekin iskaa matlab he ki america ke ek vishisht shahar ke vidyut grid par BPL pradaan karne ke liye, ek europea shahar kii tulana main adhik sankhya main ripeter kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 The second major issue is that of signal strength and operating frequency
 is pranali ke 10 se 30 mhz ke bich kii frequency kaa upyog karne kii ummid he, dashakon se jiskaa istemaal licensadhari shaukia radio operataron dwaara hota rahaa he, saath hi saath antarrashtriya shortwave prasarakon or vibhinn kismon kii sanchaar pranaaliyon dwaara bhi hua he
 The power lines are open and will act as transmitters for the signals to be carried and have the ability to completely wipe out the utility of the 10 to 30 mhz range for shortwave communication purposes, as well as to provide a user base for their users
 Also compromises on security
 yah aamtaur par, lambi duuri ke duurastha sthanon ko jodne ke liye vartmaan ke kam laagat ke 802
11 wi-fi radio pranali kaa prayog karata he, lekin yah anya ucch shakti radio sanchaar pranaaliyon kaa bhi upyog kar saktaa he
 The traditional 802
11b license was given for omnidirectional service which was only 100–150 meters
 ek yagi antina dwaara signal ko ek sankeern beam main neeche kendrit karte hue, yah kai milon kii duuri par bhi balki, vishwasaneey tareeke se kaam kar saktaa he, haalanki is takanic drushti-rekha kii aavashyaktaaen, iske sampark ko baari vanachhadit or pahari kshetron main baadhit kar sakati hai
 Also, compared to hard-wired contacts, it has a security risk; The speed is quite slow; And due to interference with other wireless devices, networks, weather and sight problems, this network may be less stable
 gramin betaar-isp adhishthapan, aamtaur par vanijyik prakruti ke nahin hote hai, balki ye radio mastul or tower, krishi bhandaaran sailo, bahut lambe ped, yaa jo bhi oonchi chiz uplabdh he, us par shaukia pahari antena dwaara banaai gai pranali kii pabandkari hote hai
 There are many companies which are currently providing this service
 america kaa ek wireless Internet access provider maanchitr, saarvajanik rup se WISPS ke liye uplabdh he
 worldspace is a digital satellite radio network based in Washington DC
 yah upgrah dwaara, adhikansh asia or europe ke saath-saath sampoorn africa ko aavruth karata he
 In addition to digital audio, users can receive one-way broadband digital data transmission from satellite
 laabh The loss paramparaagat rup se, america internet seva pradaataaon ne ek "aseemit samay" yaa ek flats rate model kaa prayog kiya he, jiske tahat shulk kaa nirdhaaran prati ghanta kii bajaay, graahak dwaara chune gaye adhiktam bitret dwaara hota he
 With the increasing demand from consumers for streaming content, such as video on demand and peer-to-peer file sharing, the use of high-bandwidth applications has increased rapidly
 un ISP ke liye jo bandwidth simit hai, mulya nirdhaaran kaa flats dar model, bandwidth kii maang ke badhane ke saath avahneey ho saktaa he
 Fixed costs represent 80–90% of the cost of providing broadband service, and although most isps keep their costs secret, the total cost is estimated at $ 0
10 per gigabyte
 vartmaan main kuch isps kaa anumaan he ki, 5% upyogkarta kul bandwidth kaa 50% hi istemaal karte hai
 To ensure these high bandwidths, users do not slow down the network, with many isps dividing their users' bandwidth allocations into "peak" and "off peak", allowing users to download large files late at night
 Encourage to do
 maujuuda broadband kii buniyadi suvidhaon ke vistaar kii laagat kaa bina bhaar uthaae, atirikt ucch bandwidth bhugtan seva pradaan karne ke liye, internet seva pradaata graahakon ke vartmaan bandwidth upyog ko simit karne ke liye nae tareeke khoj rahe hai
 This is despite the lack of broadband infrastructure in the US, according to the Economic Policy Institute: "the United States has also come in line with other countries in implementing new broadband technologies
 " Some isps have started experiments with usage-based pricing, most notably a Time Warner trial in Beaumont, Texas
 Attempts to expand use-based pricing in Rochester, New York, faced public resistance and were abandoned
 bel canada ne graahakon par bandwidth seemaa lagaai he
 When choosing an Internet provider, an often overlooked analysis is to compare different DSL and cable Internet services at the plan level
 aisa karne se yah sunishchit ho jayega ki upabhokta ko us bandwidth ke liye atirikt bhugtan nahin karnaa hoga jiskaa vah upyog nahin karata he
 To promote economic growth and reduce the digital divide, the National Broadband Plan around the world promotes universal availability of affordable broadband connectivity

 chach saatvin shatabdi ke madhya main sindh par raaj karne vaala ek bramhan vansh kaa shashak tha
 He was an ex-minister and the principal advisor of Raja Rai Daring
 raja ke marane ke baad unki vidhwaa rani se shaadi kar ke vah sattashin ho gaya
 He spread his empire to Sindh
 uske aasapaas ke chote-2 rajyon, kabeelon or sindhu ghati ke anya swatantra guton ko apane samrajya main milaane ke saahasik va safal prayaason kii daastaan chachanama main likhi hui he
 Chach was a Brahmin who rose to effective positions during the tenure of Rai Sahiraras, the king of Sindh of the Rai dynasty
 uske pita kaa naam shilise or bhai kaa naam chander tha or raja banane se pehle yah sindh ke raja saahsee kaa sabase prabhaavshaalee mukhya mantri rahaa tha
 It is said that after the death of King Daring, he fell in love with the widowed queen and became king by marrying her
 uske is tarah se raja banane kaa raja saahsee ke bhai or chitton ke samakaleen raja rana maharath ne virodh kiya or sindh ke samrajya par apana daawa kiya
 However, later in 660 AD, Chach defeated him in battle
 chachanama ke anusaar rana maharath ne jab yah paaya ki unki sena chach kii sena ke saamne zyada kuch nahin kar paa rahi he tab usne chach ko ek dwand yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 Maharath wanted to take advantage of being a Kshatriya, skilled in warfare and being a general Brahmin minister of Chacha
 vah jaanate the kii chach ek brahman hone ke naate yudhkala main nipun nahin hoga or unase haar jaayegaa
 Chach had understood the motive behind this proposal but he could not even reject the proposal
 aisa karne par use kamjor samaj liya jaataa or shashan karne kii uski kshamta par bhi sawaal khadey hote
 He accepted Rana's offer
 chach jaanata tha ki yah dwand yuddh jeetne ke liye use sabhi tarah ke kootnithik va maansik shaktiyon kaa prayog karnaa hoga kyunki shaareerik kshamta va yudhkala ke bal par vah rana ko nahin haraa saktaa tha
 Therefore, he accepted Rana's offer while playing a clever trick and on condition that Rakhi being a Brahmin cannot fight on a horse and he will fight on foot
 rana ne yah prastaav turant sweekaar kar liya kyunki unhe laga ki anbhavi va adhik balavaan hone kii vajah se aamane saamne ke paidal yuddh main vah use turant parrast kar denge
 Both of them got down from the horse but Chach asked his assistant soldier to follow him along with the horse
 najadik aate hi chach ghode par savaar ho gaya or stbhaddh khadey rana par teji se akraman kar diya
 He cut Rana's head with his sword in one stroke and after Rana's death his army also lost
 chach ne apane bhai chander ko apane samrajya ke shashan main madad karne ke liye adhikrut kiya
 He gave good jagirs to the chieftains of his side, imprisoned the opponents and organized the kingdom and made a sacrifice for Digvijay
 chittod ke raja ko parajeet kar uttar kii ore usne bees nadi ke tat par based apane virodhiyon iskandah or sikaa ko haraaya
 The condition of which was possible: near the confluence of Sindh and Chenab
 usne sikaa ko jeetne ke baad lagbhag 5000 logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya or baakiyon ko bandi bana liya
 After this came the turn of Multan and Karur
 pashchimi prayaag main usne makraan or civistaan ko jeeta
 However, King Matta of Sivistan was allowed to remain the ruler under his subjection
 iske baad usne sindhu nadi ke dakshin main baudhon ke kshetra tak apni satta kaa vistaar kiya
 The ruler Agam Lohana faced him there for a year
 lekin brahmanabad ke yuddh main agam kii mrity ke baad uske putr sarhand ne chach kii adheenta sweekaar kar lee
 Sirhand is married to Chach's niece and Chach married Agam's widow
 usne sthaneey nivaasiyon va jaateey samoohon ko apane aadhipaty main karne or unka vishwaas jeetne ke liye dheron anya kootnithik nuskhe apanaae
 He] and commanded Lohans not to carry a sword
 unhen kaale or laal rang ke uttareey pahanane padate the, reshmi kapade unke liye varjit the
 They had to climb a horse without gin and roam bare-headed, barefoot
 sindh kii vir jatiyon se chach kaa yah vyavhaar bharat ke liye antat: ghaatak siddh hua
 From Brahmanabad he attacked Sasanid situated on the borders of the city of Armanabella via Turan and Kandhar
 chach ne chalis varsh raaj kiya, kintu jahaan usne rajya kii vruddhi kii vahaan apane kuch kaaryon se use nirbal bhi banaaya
 After his death his brother Chander ruled for 8 years after which Chacha's eldest son Raja Dahir took over the reigns
 chachanama ke anusaar chach ne jaaton or lohaanon ke saath bahut durvyavaar kiya
 He orders Lohana not to carry a sword
 unhen kaale or laal rang ke uttareey pahanane padate the, reshmi kapade unke liye varjit the
 They had to climb a horse without gin and roam bare-headed, barefoot
 unako baahar nikalne par apane saath kutton ko rakhane va shahi rasoi ke liye lakdiyaan kaatane va aapurti karke kii aagyaaen di gai
 All of this was highly disrespectful to Lohana, which filled her dissatisfaction with the state
 jato se chach ko satta ke liye vidroh kaa andeshaa tha isliye usne inhen satta se dur rakhane ke liye sena main to bhartee kiya lekin salaahkaaron se jude mahatvapurn pad nahin die kyonki use dar tha ki kahin ye jat kshatriya takhta palat na kar den
 After the Islamic conquest of the Sasanid Empire in 644 AD, Rashidun's army invaded Makran and defeated the army of Sindh in the Battle of Rasil and captured Makran and Balochistan, which were then Persian territories subordinate to the Rai dynasty

 Even before the coronation, Amarendra's mother Shivgami starts searching for her bride
 vah amarendra or katappa ko kahati he ki samrajya kii sthiti or iske logon ko samajhane ke liye iskaa daura karen
 Amarendra falls in love with the princess of the Kuntal kingdom and her king's sister, Devasena
 bhallaal ko pataa chal jaataa he ki amarendra ko devsena se pyaar ho gaya he
 He then tells Shivagami that he wants to marry Devasena
 shivgami ko is bare main nahin pataa hota he ki devsena se amarendra pyaar karata he, is kaaran vah uski shaadi devsena se karaane kaa vaada kar detii he
 When Sivagami sends the marriage proposal to the Kuntal state, the messenger writes the proposal as if an arrogant person wrote it
 devsena is shaadi ke prastaav ko kade shabdon ke saath manaa kar detii he
 When Sivagami gets her answer, she orders to bring Devasena captive in anger
 kuntal samrajya par pinjariyon kaa hamalaa ho jaataa he
 With the help of Devasena's brother Kumar Verma, Amarendra foils the attack and saves Kuntal
 amarendra use bataa detaa he ki vah koun he or shivgami ke krodh ke bhay ko dur karne or use apni dulhan banane hetu raji karne kii koshish karata he
 When he reaches Mahismati, he discovers a misunderstanding
 shivgami use singhaasana yaa devsena main se kisi ek ko chunane bolti he
 He chooses Devasena
 is kaaran bhallaal ko vahaan kaa raja bana diya jaataa he or amarendra ko senapati par phir bhi log use hi raja maanate hai
 Amarendra was discharged by Bhallal as the commander of the army for Devasena's baby shower, so that he could live with his wife
 usee samay devsena raja bhallaal ke herpher ke khilaaf bolti he or shivgami ke chup rahane par bhi sawaal uthaati he
 This causes a quarrel and the two are forced out of the palace
 vah donon baahar logon ke bich khushi se jindagi bitaane lage the, par bhallaal phir se shivgami ko bhadakaata he ki amarendra use maarna chahta he or yah bhi bolta he ki yadi usne sidhi kaarywahi kii to grih yuddh shuru ho saktaa he
 For this reason, Sivagami speaks to Kattappa, his servant, that he is in trouble and has to kill Amarendra
 shivgami ke kehane par katappa ne amarendra kii peeth par dhokhe se hamalaa kar use maar diya
 Then Katappa comes and informs Shivgami that Amarendra Bahubali has died
 devsena bhi apane bachche mahendra bahubali ke saath vahaan aati he or use bhi is bare main pataa chalata he
 Shivagami tells the bewildered crowd outside the palace that Amarendra is dead and now his son Mahendra Bahubali will be the new king
 iske baad bhallaal or uske log milakar devsena or uske bachche ko pakad kar karawas main daalane kii koshish karte hai
 Devasena hands his child to Sivagami who manages to escape, but Devasena is unable to save himself
 use kaid kar liya jaataa he
 After 25 years, Mahendra Bahubali, son of Bhallaldev and Amarendra Bahubali, has a fierce battle and Bhallaldev is defeated in this war
 mahendra bahubali kaa rajbhishek hota he or mahismati kaa nayaa raja ban jaataa he

85 kotary phulpur, elahabaad, uttar pradesh sthit ek gaanv he
 a partial or complete solid-solution of two or more metallic elements is called a mishratu or alloy
 ispaat ek mishra dhaatu he
 Often the properties of alloys differ from the properties of the components that make up that alloy
 ispaat, lohe kii apeksha adhik majboot hota he
 Mishratu is bronze, brass, stitch etc
 mishradhatu vyapak rup main ek aisa shabd he jiskaa prayog kisi bhi dhatvik vastu ke liye hota he, basharte vah rasinic tatv na ho
 The art of alloying is very ancient
 satya to yah he ki kaanse kaa mahatv ek yug main itnaa adhik tha ki maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas ke us yug kaa naam hi 'kaansya yug' pad gaya he
 Although pure metals have many useful properties, such as the conductivity of heat and electricity, pure metals are not commonly used in mechanical and manufacturing operations, because they do not have the necessary strength
 dhaatu ko adhik majboot banane kii sabase mahatvapurn vidhi dhaatumishran he
 a lot of effort was made in this direction in the 19th century, the result of this is that more than five thousand alloys are available for many useful works today and new innovations are being done constantly to prepare new alloys
 aaj kisi vishesh upyog ke liye icchit gunonvali mishradhatuen banaai jaati he
 When metals dissolve in a common solution, such as an acid, they give off their metallic properties and normally form salts, but when melted they dissolve along with their metallic properties
 dhaatuon ke aise thos vilyan ko mishradhatu kehete hai
 Non-metals are also small in many alloys, but the quality of the whole remains metallic
 at: 1939 i0 main america vastu pareekshak parishad ne mishradhatu kii nimnlikhit paribhaasha kii- Initially, the alloy was used most for making coins and ornaments
 taanbe ke sikkon main tanba, tin or jasta kramash: 95 / 4 tathaa 1 pratishat rahete hai
 Until 1920, silver coins in England were made of 'sterling' silver, with silver and copper being 92
5 and 7
5 percent respectively
 america main chaandi ke sabhi sikkon main chaandi or tanba kramash: 90 tathaa 10 pratishat hote hai
 Gold and copper in England's gold coins are 91
67 and 8
33 percent respectively, and gold coins in the United States are 90 percent gold and other metals, especially copper
 platinayam, sona tathaa chaandi ke aabhushanon ke rango main sundarataa laane ke liye unako kathor, majboot tathaa tikaoo banane ke liye, yaa unhen saste mulyon main vikray ke liye duusari dhaatuon ke saath milakar kaam main laate hai
 Determining whether alloys are simple mixtures or chemical compounds is a complex problem
 kuch arthon main ye rasinic yogic hai, kyonki jab sodium saras banaaya jaataa he, tab sodium ke har ek tukade ko paar main daalane se prakaash kii teevr jwaala nikalati he or paara garam ho jaataa he, yah yogic banane kaa lakshan he
 Similarly, when a piece of aluminum metal is added to the melting gold, so much heat is generated that the entire molten metal becomes brighter
 anek mishra dhaatuon kaa rang apane avyav dhaatuon ke rangon se bilkul bhinn hota he
 For example, both silver and zinc are white, but the alloy they make is very beautiful pink
 sona pilaa or aluminium shwet hota he, kintu inaki mishradhatu kaa rang ati chamkila nillohit hota he
 This property also has compounds
 mishradhaatuon ke galnaank nikaalane par gyaat hua he ki mishra dhaatuon kaa vyavhaar do prakaar kaa he: kuch mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank jaise jaise kisi avyav dhaatu kii maatra badalati hai vaise-vaise badalata he, yah mishran kaa gun he or kuch mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank ek sthir taap hota he, jo prakat karata he ki mishradhatuen yogic hai
 The physical and chemical properties of alloys differ from the properties of their constituent metals, and the properties of alloys are by no means comparable to the properties of element metals
 yah bhinnata is kaaran se he ki jab dhaatuon ko ek saath pighalaate hai, tab ve kitne hi antaradhaatuk yogic tathaa thos vilyan banaati hai
 The density of an alloy can be less or greater than the mean density of its constituent metals
 kuch mishradhaatuon kaa rang apni avyav dhaatuon ke rangon se bilkul hi bhinn hota he
 They are harder than their constituent metals, but less flexible and malleable and more brittle
 mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank sarvada adhiktam taap par pighalanevaali avyavdhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 And usually at a minimum temperature the melting element is less than the melting point of the metal
 udaahranarth, ek mishradhatu, jisamen sisa, tin, bismuth tathaa cadmium hai, 75 ̊sein0 par galati he, jab ki nunatam taap par pighalane vaali avyav-dhaatu, tin kaa galnaank 232 ̊ sein0 he
 All these are the properties due to which alloys become more valuable than pure metals and prove more useful in industry
 upar varnit falon dwaara tathaa sookshmdarshi, eks-kiran varnakram maapi, ooshmiya tathaa rasinic vishleshan or duusare bhautik pareekshanon dwaara mishradhaaton ke sanghathan tathaa crystalia rachana ke vistrut adhyayan ke parinamswaroop, mishradhaatuon ko teen shreniyon main rakhaa gaya he
 This division has been done on the basis of how the group of atoms of the constituent metals in the alloys is organized
 ye teen shreniyan nimnlikhit hai: In these types of alloys, when the element metals are molten, they dissolve in each other, but when solid, the crystals of the metals break apart, that is, the metals are insoluble
 is prakaar mishradhatu prayek avyav dhaatu ke shuddh crystal kaa mishran hoti he or thanda karne par koi ek avyav dhaatu thos rup main pruthak ho jaati he
 For example, a liquid alloy consisting of only 10 parts lead and 90 parts tin, when cooled, pure tin crystals are first separated in the same way as pure ice crystals cooled from a dilute solution of sugar
 Are separate jis taap par tin ke crystal pruthak hona prarambh karte he, vah taap shuddh tin ke galnaank se kam hota he
 When the melting point of the tin is dissolved in the lead, the molecular weight of the lead is determined by the same rule by which the molecules of the dissolved substances in the water are removed
 is vidhi se un kai dhaatuon kaa anubhaar nikaala gaya he, jo tanughatvik vilyan main alag parmaanu ke rup main rahati he
 Lead-antimony alloys belong to the mixture category
 antimony bhangur hota he or sisa mulaayam
 The printing metal is a alloy of CC, antimony and a very small amount of tin
 is mishradhatu main antimony kii kathorta to hoti he, kintu yah uski tarah bhangur nahin hoti
 In this type of alloys, the atoms of one element metal fit well in the crystalline structure of the other element metal
 thos vilyan shrenee kii mishradhatuen do bhinn prakaar kii hoti he: Many copper-nickel alloys that have significant use fall under the category of solid solutions
 udaahranarth, ve mishradhatuen jinase nikal ke sikke, rifl kii goliyon kii tapiyaan or ek taar jiskaa vaidyut pratirodh adhik hota he, banataa he
 Many of the Canadian minerals contain copper and nickel sulfides, which are smelted to form an alloy

 This alloy is called monel metal
 yah adhik tanya, lacheelee tathaa sanksharan pratirohak hoti he
 Generally, metals do not form compounds by mixing with each other, but by heat analysis it has been found that metals combine with each other to form a large number of compounds
 in yogicon kaa vargeey naam antaradhaatuk yogic he
 Most compounds of this type form alkali and alkaline clay metals, by combining them with the metals of the odd subclass of the periodic table
 in yogicon main dhaatuen kis maatra main mili hui hai, isko rasinic sutron dwaara darshaate hai
 It is known from the study of these formulas that these types of compounds violate all the laws of valency that are formed by the compounds formed by the combination of metals and non-metals
 udaahranarth, sodium, tin or sisa ke saath rasinic kriya kar nimnlikhit yogic banaata he : Many interstitial compounds are very stable and do not dissolve their constituents in metals even when heated to temperatures higher than their melting point
 ye yogic taral ammonia main ghulte hai or is prakaar se jo vilyan taiyaar hota he, vah vaidyut chaalak hota he
 When they are electrically decomposed, one component metal, which is less positive than the other, accumulates on the positive and the other on the minuscule
 antaradhaatuk yogic kyon banaata he, isaki abhi tak saidhantik vyakhya nahin hui
 Only so far it has been proved that those metals, which have the same properties, do not coincide with each other
 chunki is prakaar kii mishradhatuen kathor, bhangur, bahut hi kam tanyashil tathaa lacheelee hoti hai, at: inamen se keval kuch hi upyogi hai
