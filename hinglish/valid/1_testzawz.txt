 vah use ali baba ke ghar raat main khaanaa khaane ke liye bulaata he
 She then recognizes the thief as Morgana

 It was first noted in the year of 1980 that the dissolution of the ozone level is happening all over the earth
 dakshin dhruv vistaaron main ozon str kaa vighatan 40%-50% hua he
 This massive phenomenon is called ozone hole
 maanav awaas vaale vistaaron main bhi ozon chhidron ke failane kii sambhaavna ho sakati he
 But it is based on the climatic condition of gases and the existence of impurities floating in the atmosphere
 ozon str ke ghatane ke kaaran dhruviya pradeshon par jamaa barf pighalane lagi he tathaa maanav ko anek prakaar ke charm rogon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 This is a problem arising from the use of Freon and Chlorofluorocarbon gas in refrigerators and air conditioners

 Air is polluted due to gases emanating from vehicles and factories

 Land pollution is caused by people throwing garbage
 vaayu pradooshan arthath hawa main aise avaanchit gaison, dhul ke kanon aadi kii upasthiti, jo logon tathaa prakruti donon ke liye khatre kaa kaaran ban jaae
 In other words, pollution means being contaminated or dirty
 vaayu kaa avaanchit rup se ganda hona arthath vaayu pradooshan he
 Some common causes of air pollution are: vaayu pradooshan hamaare vaataavaran tathaa hamaare upar anek prabhaav daalata he
 Some of them are as follows 2
 vaayu pradooshan se sardiyon main koharaa chaaya rahata he, jiskaa kaaran dhuen tathaa mitti ke kanon kaa kohre main mila hona he
 This reduces natural visibility and causes eye irritation and difficulty in breathing
 3
 ozon parat, hamaari prithvi ke chaaron ore ek surakshatmak gas kii parat he
 Which protects us from harmful ultraviolet rays coming from the sun
 vaayu pradooshan ke kaaran jin aparivartan, anuvashankeey tathaa twachaa cancer ke khatre bad jate hai
 4
 Earth's temperature increases due to air pollution, because the heat coming from the sun does not reduce the effect of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the environment, which are harmful
 5
 vaayu pradooshan se amleey varsha ke khatre bade hai, kyonki barish ke pani main sulfur daai oxide, nitrogen oxide aadi jaisi jahrili gaison ke ghulne kii sambhaavna badi he
 This can cause damage to crops, trees, buildings and historic buildings
 6
 dhwani kii adhikta ke kaaran bhi pradooshan hota he, jise ham dhwani pradooshan ke rup main jaanate hai
 Noise pollution simply means unwanted sound that makes us feel irritable
 iskaa kaaran he- rail ingine, hawaii jahaaj, janarator, telephone, televijan, vaahan, laudspikar aadi aadhunik mashine
 Weakening of hearing power, headache, irritability, hypertension or neurological, psychological defects are caused by prolonged noise pollution
 lambey samay tak dhwani pradooshan ke prabhaav se swaabhaavik pareshaaniyaan bad jaati he
 Water pollution means the contamination of water due to the presence of unwanted and noxious elements in the water, so that it is not potable
 jal pradooshan ke vibhinn kaaran nimnlikhit haih Water pollution has the following effects: bhoomi pradooshan se abhipraay jameen par jahrile, avaanchit or anupayogi padaarthon ke bhoomi main visarjeet karne se he, kyonki isse bhoomi kaa nimnikaran hota he tathaa mitti kii gunvattta prabhavit hoti he
 Due to irresponsibility of people the earth is getting polluted
 bhoomi pradooshan ke mukhya kaaran hai : Land pollution has the following harmful effects: iskaa arth he ki vyavsaayik ikaiyaan aisa koi bhi kadam na uthaae, jisase paryaavaran ko or adhik haani ho
 For this it is necessary that the business complies with all the pollution control regulations implemented by the government
 manushyon dwaara kiye ja rahe paryaavaran pradooshan ke niyantran ke liye vyavsaayik ikaiyon ko aage aana chahie
 This means that commercial units help to modify or improve the damage to the environment
 saath hi yadi pradooshan ko niyantrit karnaa sambhav na ho to uske nivaaran ke liye upachaaratmak kadam uthaa lene chahie
 For example plantation; The afforestation program can reduce air pollution in the surroundings of industrial units
 vyavsaay kii prakruti tathaa kshetra This means make people aware of the causes and consequences of environmental pollution, so that they can voluntarily protect the environment instead of harming the environment
 udhaaharan ke liye vyavsaay jaagrukta kaaryakramon kaa aayojan kare
 Nowadays some business units are taking up the responsibilities of developing and maintaining parks in the cities, which shows that they are environmentally conscious
 pradushan ek pramukh paryaavarniya mudda ban gaya he kyoki yah har aayu varg ke logon or jaanwaron ke liye swasthya kaa khatra he
 In recent years, the rate of pollution has been increasing rapidly as industrial waste materials are directly mixed in soil, air and water
 haalanki hamaare desh main ise niyantrit karne ke liye puraa dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 This needs to be dealt with seriously otherwise our future generations will suffer a lot
 pradooshan prakritik sansadhano ke prabhaav ke anusaar kai shreniyon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he jaise kii vaayu pradooshan, bhu pradooshan, jal pradooshan, dhwani pradooshan aadi| pradooshan kii dar insaan ke adhik paise kamaane ke swaarth or kuch anaavashyak ichchhaaon ko puraa karne kii vajah se bad rahi he
 In the modern era, where technological advancement is given more priority, every person has forgotten the real discipline of life
 lagaataar or anaavashyak wano kii katautee, shaharikaran, audyogikaran ke madhyam se zyada utpaadan, pradooshan kaa bada kaaran ban gaya he
 The harmful and toxic waste generated by such activities causes irreversible changes to soil, air and water, which ultimately leads us to unhappiness
 It is the need of a social awareness program at the public level to root out and overcome the larger social issue

 In the year 1889 a new organ, designed by William Sweetland, was added to the building
 iske aane vaale varshon main kai vibhinn prakaar ke chitra bhi haul ke andar sthapit kiye gaye
 In September 1890, a successful fine arts and industrial exhibition was held in the building, whose catalog can still be seen at the Monmouth Museum
 1897 or 1903 ke bich, haul kai naatakon ke liye abhinayta, nirdeshak or sanchaalak ben greet dwaara manchan ke liye istemaal kiya gaya tha

 dharamshastra main vyapaariyon ke sangh ke liye praaia: 'negam' shabd prayukt hua he
 The word corporation was meant to refer to the city, but at some places it is clear that the corporation was a special type of city which was related to merchants
 vrihatkalpasutra bhashya main nigam lenden kaa kaam karanevaale vyapaariyon kii basti ke arth main aata he- sangrahik nigam keval yahi kaary karte the or asangrahik nigam iske atirikt duusare kaary bhi karte the
 The corporation has also been used for merchant groups and associations

 Such currencies are also derived from Bhita
 amravati ke 'dhankatakas nigamas' lekh main bhi nigam kaa upyog nagar ke liye nahin apitu vyapaariyon ke sangh ke rup main hua he
 This usage of the word Nigam is also found in a currency of the third century BC, in which the article 'shahjeetiye Nigamash' is inscribed
 vyapaariyon or kaarigaron ke sangh ke liye smritiyon main anek shabd prayukt hue hai- shrenee, pug, gana, vraat, sangh or negam
 These words have also been used as ordinary words for group organizations without any difference, but apart from time and space, their specific narrow meanings are also seen
 smriti tikaaon or niabandh granthon main bhi inke prayog main vibhinn paramparaayen milti hai
 But still it can be said that the term of these, despite being a general term for economic organizations, was specifically meant for industries, ie, it was an organization of artisans of the same industry or craft
 vyapaariyon kaa sanghathan praaia: negam kehalaata tha
 In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Vaishyas are called 'ganasha'; They can earn money only through co-operation, not by personal hard work; Collective organization is natural for them
 vaidic kaal main hamen gana, vraat, ganpati or shreshthi shabd milte hai jo anuvarthi kaal main aarthik sanghathanon ke saath sambandhit the
 These indicate the initial stage of development of collective institutions
 buddha ke yug kii visheshta thi sabhi kshetron main samuhik sanghathanon kaa badhata hua mahatv
 This tradition is also seen in economic life
 is kaal main shreniyon ke viksit rup kaa pramaan teen pravritiyon main parilakshith hota he- vyavsaayon kaa vanshanukramik hona, udyogon kaa sthaniyakaran or jettthak athwa pramukh ke naam se pradhan kaa pad
 But we only know from the memory of the constitution and procedure of the categories
 dharmasutron ke kaal main sambhavat: in niyamon ko sthir rup nahin mil paaya tha
 The importance of these rules in memories increased gradually
 shrenee kii samuhik sampatti main samuhik rup main kiye jane vaale kisi kaary main, usase hone vaale haani athwa laabh main saadharantaya sabhi sadasyon kaa samaan bhaag, adhikaar tathaa uttardaayitv hota tha kaarigaron ke sanghathan main sadasyon dwaara kiye janevaale kaary ke anusaar bhi unke bhaag or uttardaayitv kaa nirdhaaran hota tha
 The categories had definite rules to smooth their constitution and function
 raja kaa kartavya tha ki in niyamon kaa paalan or sangrakshan kare
 It was the rule to punish a member in a Sangh assembly if he opposes the right, says nonsense or does not give any speaker an opportunity to speak
 shrenee ke kaary kaa prabandh karne ke liye 2, 3 athwa 5 kaarychintak hote the
 These organizations had wide powers over their members
 sadasyon ke paraspar jhagadon kaa nirnay karne ke liye shreniyan nyaayalayon kaa bhi kaam karti thim
 The categories had complete freedom in their work
 raja usee avasthaa main hastkshep karata tha jab vah shrenee kaa kisi prakaar se ahit hone kii sambhaavna dekhtaa tha
 The military strength of the categories was also not negligible
 shreniyon kaa sthayitv or samaaj main unki pratishtha kaa ek mukhar pramaan yah he ki kisi punya krity kaa sthaayee aayojan karne ke liye log shreniyon ke paas nishchit dhan jamaa kar dete the jiske vyaaj ke rup main shrenee us kaary kaa prabandh karti thi
 The proof of working of the bank in this way of categories is found in many ancient records, the oldest of which are from Nashik and Junnar
 mandsor ke ek abhilekh se gyaat hota he ki shrenee ke sadsy apane nijee udyog ke atirikt anya kai kaaryon main bhi kushal hote the
 In ancient times, the spread and circulation of these organizations was very high
 jaatakon tathaa jain granth 'prashn vyakaran' or 'jambudweepaprajipti' main shrenee ke rup main sangathit vyavsaayon or shilpon kii sankhya, 18 batalaai gai he
 Names of many such categories have also been enumerated in the Mahavastu
 abhilekhon se bhi aisi sthiti kaa samarthan hota he
 How many people from different professions used to be members of the categories is some indication from a record dated 120 AD from Nashik which mentions two categories of filaments in Govardhana itself
 purv madhyakaal main shreniyon kii sthiti main parivartan dikhalaai padataa he
 His organization was relaxed, his control over the members was not effective, so the king often had to interfere in his work
 shrenee ke pradhan kii shakti bad rahi thi
 There are also fewer instances of banks doing work by categories
 kuch shreniyan hi sanghathan ke prabhaav or niyantran ke ksheen hone par aage chalakar jati athwa upjati ke rup main parivartit ho gai
 In many Jataka tales, there is mention of several merchants working together during a sea voyage or a pilgrimage
 inamen setthi kii bhi charchaa milti he jise sambhavat: vyapaariyon ke pratinidhi ke rup main rajdurbar main manyata praapt thi
 From 'divyavadan' and 'daskumarcharit', there is some mention of the procedure of the traders association and their authority and influence
 shreniyon ke samvidhan or niyamon ke sambandh main upar jo kaha gaya he vah smritiyon main vyapaariyon ke sanghon ke liye bhi nirdisht he
 Sometimes there was also a separate union of traders of specific materials or special trades
 vaishali kii mudraon se gyaat hota he ki shreshthi, saarthwah or balki kulik logon kaa ek sammilit sangh tha jisaki shakhaayen uttari bharat ke anek nagaron main faili thim
 The letters sent from the branches used to have the currency of the head of the branch or the caretaker, along with the union involved
 vyapaariyon kaa sangh shreniyon kii tulana main purv madhyakaal main bhi sangathit or prabhaavapurn rahaa
 The records of South India provide details of the work of many powerful trade associations
 inaki sadsyta or kaaryakshetra vistrut the
 They had their own traditions which they respected appropriately

 In "agnipuran", for the first time, the hero-heroine is discussed as the prolific influences of Shringar Ras
 sanskrit or hindi ke parvarti lekhakon ne "agnipurana" kaa sthiti sweekaar karte hue shringaarras kii simaaon main hi is vishay kaa vistaar kiya he
 These limitations, which have been violated as an exception only, can be understood as follows: bharat ne nayak ke chaar bhed kiye hai : dhiralalit, dhiraprashanth, dhirodatt, dhiroddhat
 These distinctions belong to the protagonist of the play
 "agnipurana" main inke atirikt chaar or bhedon kaa ullekh he : anukool, darkshin, shath, dhristh
 These distinctions are clearly related to the beauty of makeup
 bhoj ne "saraswatikanthabharan" tathaa "shringarprakash" main in do ke atirikt anya anek vargikarnon kaa ullekh kiya he
 But only one of those classifications, which was also mentioned by Bharata as a distinction of man, was accepted by the latter writers: Uttam, Madhyam, Adham
 bhanudutt ne "rasmanjri" main ek nayaa vargeekaran diya, jise aage chalakar pradhan vargeekaran mana gaya
 It is: husband, vice-chancellor
 anukool ityadi bhed pati or upapati ke antargat sweekaar kiye gaye
 Bhanudatta mentions another distinction named Prakrit
 rup goswami ne "ujjvalaneelamani" main vaishik sweekaar nahin kiya
 He considered Krishna the only hero
 hindi main nayakabhed ke pramukh lekhakon ne uparyukt vargikarnon main se pratham ko chhodkar shesh ko praaia: sweekaar kar liya he
 Considering husband, vice-chancellor, Vaishik as the main classification, the favorable, south, shash, hateful distinctions have been placed under the husband
 nayak ke uttam, madhyam, adham bhedon ko hindi main keval kuch lekhakon ne hi sweekaar kiya he, jinamein sundar, top or rasline pramukh hai
 Some other distinctions of the hero are as follows: Proached, obeyed, clever, ignorant
 maani ke do bhed hai : rupamani, gunmani
 There are also two distinctions of clever: vow clever, action-clever
 rasline ne inhen ke saath swayandoot nayak kaa bhi kathan kiya he
 Padmakar is also considered heroic after Bhanudutt's imitation of the ignorant
 keshav ne nayak ke prachhnn or prakaash bhed bhi maane hai
 By the opinion of Rasleen, there are three strains of vice and two strains of Vaishik
 hindi ke nayak-nayika-bhed sambandhi sahitya kaa nirmaan adhikanshat: reetikaal main hua he
 This poetry of hero-heroine-distinction is the result of a confluence of two powerful streams
 inamen se pehali dhara he sahityashastra evam nayak-nayika-bhed sambandhi shastreey granthon kii, jiskaa aarambh bharat ke "natshastra" se hota he; tathaa duusari dhara he krishna or gopiyon kii shringaar kridaaon ke varnan kii, jo "harivansh", "padam", "vishnu" "bhagwat" tathaa "brahmavaivatan" puraanon kii upatyakaon main bahati hui or umapatidhar, jayadev, chandidas, vidyapati, mira, narsingh mehta tathaa surdaas aadi anek bhakt kaviyon kii madhur vaani se vilsit hoti hui, nimbark, vallabh tathaa chaitanya jaise mahaan aacharyon ke samarthan se sampusht hui he
 From the point of view of Acharya, the Hindi writers' contribution of this part of poetry is extraordinary
 kavyasaushthav kii drushti se bhi vidwaanon ke matanusaar itane unche str ke sahitya kaa itane bade pariman main nirmaan hindi sahitya ke or kisi kaal main nahin hua
 According to Bharata, the heroine has eight distinctions: vasakaja, virahotkanthita, swadhinapatika, kalahantarita, khandita, vipralbdha, prakshitabhratika, abhinasarika
 ise ham paristhitibhed kahenge
 According to later writers, who have been called "prakriti-bhed", there are three types of heroines: Uttama, Madhyama, Adhama
 "agnipurana" ke lekhak ne nayika ke keval ek vargeekaran kaa ullekh kiya he : swakiya, parvikaya, punarbhu, samanya
 Of these four distinctions, Punarbhu was not subsequently recognized
 rudrat tathaa rudrabhatt ne ek shodash bhed vargeekaran prastut kiya, jise parvarti lekhakon dwaara sarvaadhik pradhanta di gai
 This classification is as follows: bhoj ne nayak kii bhanti nayika ke bhi kuch moulik vargeekaran kiye hai, kintu unhen parvarti lekhakon ne sweekaar nahin kiya
 Apart from the above three classifications, Bhanudutt has mentioned a new classification, which was later accepted by most Hindi writers
 vah he, : nayika : anyasambhogadu:khitaa, vakroktigarvita, maanavati
 Quibble: romanticism, aestheticism
 iske atirikt bhanudutt ne shodash bhed vargeekaran main mugdha evam oodhaa ke kuch naveen upabhedon kaa ullekh kiya he, jo is prakaar hai, mugdha : gyaatyauvana, agyatayauvana
 Mugdha is again a newborn, Vishrabandhanavoda
 oodhaa : gupta, vidagdha, lakshitha, kulata, anushayna,, mudita
 In Bharata's situational classification, Bhanudatta has added a new distinction named Proshyapatika, which later became known as Pravatsyapatika
 abhisarika ke antargat unhone jyotsnabhisarika, tamistrabhisarika tathaa divsabhisarika kaa ullekh kiya he
 Hindi writers have followed Bhanudutt the most
 shing bhoopal evam vishwanath ne samanya ke do upabhedon kaa ullekh kiya he : raktaa, virakta
 Vishwanath mentions five of Mugdha, five of Madhyas, and six of Pragalbha, but the number of heroines does not include these charges
 goswami ne keval "harivallabhaon" ko nayika maanate hue samanya ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 He has also considered Mugdha, Madhyam, Pragalbha Bheda under Perkiya
 rup goswami dwaara ullikhit mugdha ke chha:, madhya ke chaar tathaa pragalbha ke saat prabhed vishwanath krit prabhedon se milte julate hai
 The number of heroic texts in Hindi is more than two hundred, but most of them are unpublished
 sarvaadhik lokapriy granthon main matiram kaa "rasraj" tathaa padmakar kaa "jagadvinod" agrani hai
 Bhanudatta's "rasamanjari" is often followed in these texts
 paristhiti-bhed-vargeekaran main aagatapatika naam kaa ek dasavaan bhed joda gaya he, jise hindi ke adhikansh lekhakon na aarambh se hi sweekaar kiya he
 Rahim's "barwai-heroine-distinction" also became famous due to the melody of the Barwai verses
 anya praarambhik granthon main "hit-tarangini", "sahityalahari", "rasmanjri", "rasikapriya", "sundarshringaar", "sudhanidhi", "kavikulakalpataru" tathaa "bhashaabhushan" ke naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 Kumaramani Shastri, Dev, Dev, Rasleen and Bhikharidas are more important due to their original contribution in later writers
 nayikabhed ke kshetra main aadhunik kaal main hariudh, biharilal bhatta tathaa prabhudayal mital ne ullekhneey kaary kiya he
 Kriparam's "hitarangarani" is the first available treatise on heroine in Hindi, yet it discusses the subject in great detail
 is granth kii kuch moulik udbhaavnaayen is prakaar hai- Surdas's "sahitya Lahiri" is a style of code
 iskaa prayek pad praaia: kisi ek alankaar tathaa kisi ek nayika kaa udhaaharan prastut karata he
 Samanya was not recognized in this book
 nandadaas kii "rasmanjri" kii apni visheshtaayen hai
 Samanya's statement has been made in this, but no importance has been given to him
 isamen nayikaon kii paribhaashaayen itani vistrut hai ki vanrya nayika kaa chitra sa prastut ho jaataa he or udaahranon kaa abhaav nahin khatkata
 Keshavdas has also mentioned Samanya in his "rasikapriya", not even given his definition
 unhone vishwanath or rup goswami ke anukaran par mugdha, madhya tathaa pragalbha ke prabhed kiye he
 Preamabhisarika, Garvabhisarika and Kamabhisarika are mentioned under the Abhinasarika, and the light and hidden name of each of the distinctions are discerned
 coccoke ke kaamshaastra sambandhi granth "ratirahasy" ke aadhaar par nayika ke padmini, chitrini, shankhini tathaa hastini bhedon kaa bhi ullekh hua he
 These distinctions have been repeated by Sundar and some other writers
 "sundarashringaar" ke anya vargeekaran praaia: "rasraj" ke samaan hai
 Tosh mentions several fundamental classifications in "sudhanidhi" - chintamani ne "kavikulakalpataru" main mugdha, tathaa pragalbha ke prabhed kiye hai
 Jaswantsinh's "bhasha Bhushan" has been a slaughtering of students due to its shortness
 isamen vibhinn nayikaon kii keval paribhaashaayen hi di gai hai
 It has special value in the form of ornamentation
 kumaarmani shastri ne "rasikarsaal" main keval naveen bhedprabhedon kaa hi ullekh nahin kiya, puraane bhedon main nae sambandh bhi sthapit kiye hai
 Their major fundamental installations are as follows - "rasvilas" main unhone pad, jati tathaa prantiyata ke aadhaar par nayikaon kaa varnan kiya he, jo chitropamata evam sookshmdarshita kii drushtiyon se adwitiya he
 The passage of "sukhsagargarang" is famous: gandharvi ke antargat, arthath saadhe das se saadhe choubees varsh tak kii avasthaa ke bich main, mugdha, madhya tathaa pragalbha ke 13 prabhedon main se prayek kii ayusima nirdhaarit kii gai he
 The most elaborate of heroines is available in Rasleen's "rasprabodh"
 unki pramukh moulik uplabdhiyaan is prakaar hai - bhikharidas has repeated many beliefs of his Tosh and Rasleen in "shringarirnayanay"
 anyasambhogadu:khitaa kaa vipralabdha ke antargat rakhkar unhone apni moulik sujh kaa parichay bhi diya he
 In modern period writers, "hariyodh" has shown its originality in the strains of Uttama and Madhyama
 unke "rasakalash" main in bhedon kaa pratham baar vibhaajan kiya gaya he, jo is prakaar he - Bihari Lal Bhatt has often accepted the beliefs of Kumaramani Shastri regarding the circumstances
 unke "sahityasagar" main dhira, adhira tathaa dhiradhira bhedon kaa sambandh keval kanishtha se mana gaya he
 Prabhudayal Mital has given recognition to the classification accepted by Bhanudatta, Matiram, Padmakar, etc
, even after thoroughly discussing the subject of heroine

 Health survey and medical research are necessary to set proper program to prevent diseases in public
 ye kaary ab ek sanstha dwaara kiye jate hai, jiskaa naam indian concil ov medical research he
 Medical research work began in our country in the second phase of the 19th century as an investigation related to the spread of diseases called malaria and visuchika
 inpar san
 1869 main lui or kaningham ne kuch kaary prarambh kiya tha
 a scholar named Hafkin was appointed by the government to investigate whether the vaccine would benefit or not in relation to the Visuchika in Bengal and the plague in Bombay
 iske parinamswaroop bombai main san 1899 main plig research institute banaaya gaya, jiskaa naam aage chalakar hazkin research institute rakhaa gaya san 1900 main shimla ke paas kasauli main chechak ke tike ke liye linf banane or jeevanu sambandhi anveshan karne ke liye pastyar institute kii sthapana hui
 By this time, there seemed to be a need for a central organization to conduct research work on diseases in the country

 During the First World War, the work of this institution often stopped

 The Bharatiya Janata Party national president had said that he could not directly speak to Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray
 is bayaan se shivasena main baari rosh tha
 There was even speculation of a rift in the Bharatiya Janata Party Shiv Sena

 Bharatiya Janata Party leader Gopinath Munde met Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and Sanjay Raut
 mulaakaat ke baad gopinath munde ne daawa kiya ki shivasena se unke rishte majboot hai

 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Gopinath Munde proposed to join the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena to defeat the congress-ncp alliance in the state of Maharashtra

 Munde was outspoken in the meeting to chalk out a strategy for the rally organized by the Bharatiya Janata party-shiv Sena and RPI
 ramdaas athawale ko yuti ke saath laane main bhi unki bhoomika rahi he
 The unity of Bhima and Shiv Shakti is considered important from the point of view of Maharashtra politics, especially in the backdrop of the national upheaval and the current state of Congress, today's rally is important for the Bharatiya Janata party-shiv Sena
 gopinath munde kii bhartiya janata party main hi rahane kii ghoshnaa se sabase zyada raahat shivasena ne mahasoos kii he
 If Gopinath Munde had turned the Bharatiya Janata Party to Ram, then the Shiv Sena would have suffered a setback
 maharashtra navnirmaan sena ko balance karne ke liye shivasena ne shivshakti-bhimshakti kaa jo sameekaran rachaa he uske shilpakaaron main gopinath munde hi pramukh rahe hai
 If this equation can get the most effective results other than Mumbai's BMC election, then it is only Vidarbha and Marathwada
 munde jis marathavada kii raajnneeti karke centre kii raajnneeti main pahunche hai us marathavada main maharashtra kii takreeban 25 fisadi aabaadi rahati he
 Out of this, about 15 percent of the population is of Dalit and scheduled caste people
 shivshakti-bhimshakti ke sameekaran kii yah sabase badi prayogshaala he
 This is the reason why Gopinath Munde worked hard to join the strength of Ramdas Athawale and was successful in it
 aise main agar munde bhartiya janata party chhod dete to shivshakti-bhimshakti sameekaran kii marathavada main beasar hone kii ashanka thi
 Knowledgeable people believe that Munde, along with the Shiv Sena, worked hard to create the equation of Shiv shakti-bhim Shakti with the aim of winning more and more seats in Marathwada this time so that they can silence their opponents in Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party
 
 is baar munde sakriy hue to ramdaas athawale ko pata laae
 Otherwise, there is a section in Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party which gives priority to alliance with Maharashtra Navnirman Sena by ending alliance with Shiv Sena

 is mudde par hangaamaa karte hue munde ne kaha ki workmen compnseshan act ke tahat ye karmi 13 lakh rupee paane ke adhikari he
 25 lakh declared from this is not a concern for compensation

 munde ne sarkaar se yah bhi jaananaa chaha ki aties ke adhikariyon kaa beemaa premium kya sarkaar ne adaa kar diya he? 8 july 2005 ko sarkaar ne aties ke police adhikariyon kaa group beemaa karne kaa aadesh diya tha par usak premium nahin bharaa gaya he natijatan shahid hue pulicekarmi beemaa clem se vanchit rah gaye he

 unhone bataaya ki maharashtra sarkaar ne sirf darjan bhar jilon ko suukhaagrast ghoshit kiya he, jabaki yah sankhya do darjan se bhi zyada he

 munde ne jo kaha vahi baat puure vishwa main failaa hindi bhashi samaaj ek arse se kahata aa rahaa he
 Which the corporate world has understood, but the people sitting in power circles and the victims of the perceived fascination of linguistic modernity do not want to understand
 munde kii is baat kaa matlab ekadam saafe he
 This means that for a large section of the country - including non-hindi speaking people and hundreds of mps - writing, reading and speaking Hindi is easier than in English
 hindi ke liye sansadeey samiti kii baithak ke bahishkaar kii baat kisi hindi bhashi ne nahin balki maharashtra ke ek saansad ne kahi magar hairaani kii baat he ki munde kii ye baat hindi ke kisi akhbaar ko raas nahin ai, shaayad yahi kaaran he ki hindi ke kisi bhi akhbaar ne ise jagah nahin di
 This may not be news for Hindi newspapers, but it is very big news for people who are fond of Hindi
