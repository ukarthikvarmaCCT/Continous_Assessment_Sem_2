 On reading Dasakumarcharit, the reader realizes that he is tasting some succulent composition
 jivan kii anubhutiyaan aankhon ke samaksh utar aati hai or vah kavi ko apana ek atarang mitra sa anubhav karata he

 Social stratification is the process in which groups of individuals are stratified from high to low in different categories in the hierarchy relative to the amount of their prestige, wealth, and power
 varg starikaran vishwavyaapee he or uske utpann hone ke anek kaaran hai jaise puunjipati or shramik varg audyogikaran kii dein hai; dhan kii vibhinn avasthaa dhani, madhyam or rnidhan varg ko janm detii he
 The study of social stratification is an important subject in sociology
 samaaj ke vibhinn swaroopon kaa adhyayan karne se yah pataa chalata he ki samaaj main jis prakaar vyakti ek duusare se jude hote hai, usamen prayek vyakti kaa apana ek alag sthaan hota he
 Doctor, teacher, businessman, mechanic, engineer, laborer, police, nurse, pilot, driver
 ye sabhi kisi peshey se jude aise vyakti hai jinke peshey alag-alag hai or un peshon ke kaaran unki saamaajik sthiti bhi bhinn he
 Therefore it is said that variation at the social level is a specific identity of any society
 prayek samaaj main yah vibhinnata paayi jaati he or samajashastriyon ne vibhinn samaajik kaaryon se jude vyaktiyon kaa adhyayan apane vishisht avadharanaon kii madad se kiya he
 a person is considered high and low depending on the prevailing rules of that society
 sabhi samaaj ke niyam yon to alag-alag hote hai parantu uske baavjood bhi samaaj main vyakti ko unchaa va nicha sthaan pradaan karne ke kuch saiddhanthik aadhaar hai jin saiddhanthik aadhaar ko dhyaan main rakhkar samajashaastra main saamaajik swaroop kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 As far as social stratification is concerned, Berger and Berger, while defining it, believed that social stratification distinguishes an individual from a society which rests in the society on the principle of social stratification
 saamaajik starikaran logon ko shreneebaddh karne kii prakriya he
 The different categories in which individuals are divided are called levels
 kingsle davis ne kaha he ki jab ham jati, varg tathaa saamaajik starikaran kii baat sonchate hai to hamaare mastishk main un samoohon kaa dhyaan aata he jiske sadsy samaaj main apana ek sthaan rakhte hai
 Based on that, they have gained some prestige
 iske aadhaar par ek samooh kii sthiti duusare samooh se vaidhanik drushti se alag maani jaati he vah saamaajik starikaran kaa aadhaar ban jaati he
 When we talk of a society based on class, it can be said that a classless society cannot be imagined
 yah kaha jaataa he ki janajaatiy samaaj main koi varg nahin hota
 Their social organization is based on age, gender and kinship but when that society gets complicated and some people earn more by earning more wealth then the system of stratification starts to be visible in that society too
 isliye tam bottmor kaa kahana tha samaaj main varg tathaa shrenee kaa bantwaaraa satta or pratishtha ke aadhaar par krambaddh swaroop kisi bhi samaaj kii saarvbhaumik kaaran he jisane sabhi saamaajik vaigyanikon ko prabhavit kiya he
 Penguin defines social stratification in the dictionary as saying that when people are categorized after taking into account certain aspects of inequality, this type of social variation is called social stratification
 is prakaar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki saamaajik starikaran kii prakriya koi amoort avadharana nahin he varan yah ek vaastavik saamaajik sthiti he jiske kuch aise lakshan hai jo ek vyakti, samooh, samaaj, samskruti ke logon ko duusare vyakti, samooh, samaaj tathaa samskruti se alag kar unhen ek unchi tathaa nimna shrenee sopan ke antargat saamaajik sthaan dete hai
 The criteria and basis of social stratification are different in all the society, but nevertheless there is an attempt to understand the process of stratification as a universal concept based on some criteria
 starikaran ke sandarbh main nimna upaagam kii charchaa kii jaati he- Broome and Seljnik have explained stratification by the three approaches mentioned above
 unka yah maananaa tha ki starikaran kaa adhyayan in teenon upaagam ko ek vidhi maanakar kiya ja saktaa he
 Studying stratification in the iconic approach may be asked, how do people classify themselves? What criteria do we use? To assess their position, how do they see those categories and sort those criteria? aatmanishth upaagam main bhi logon se yah poocha jaataa he ki wo apane aapako duusare vyakti yaa samooh kii tulana main swayan ko yaa jis samooh ke hisse hai use duusare ke mukaable kaise akalan karte hai
 In sociology, this question can be asked to which class you belong
 or prashn ke jawaab ke aadhaar par shodhakartta us jawaab kaa aatmanishth tareeke se vishleshan kar yah jaanane kii koshish kar saktaa he ki samaaj main vah vyakti, samooh apane aap ko koun sa sthaan dete hai
 In an objective approach, the researcher tries to decide objectively what the person's place is by inspecting
 karl marks ne is vastunishth tareeke kaa istemaal kar yah akalan karne kii koshish kii, ki utpaadan kii prakriya main jis vyakti kii jo bhoomika hoti he uske aadhaar par uske varg sthaan kaa akalan kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition to Marx, Germany's sociology Max Weber also considered three criteria to be important and stratified the society by considering it as a major foundation
 maiks webar kaa yah maananaa tha ki uparyukt teenon aadhaar ko ek duusare se alag karke dekhnaa shaayad sambhav na ho isliye in teenon ke sammilit swaroop ko milakar dekhnaa chahie taaki vyakti ke sthaan kaa sahi akalan kiya ja sake
 Undoubtedly, these three grounds have their own specific place and all these can be seen in different ways as a determinant element in a person's behavior and place
 is prakaar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki samajashastriyon main is baat ko lekar matbhed ho saktaa he ki starikaran kaa adhyayan kaise kiya jaae? parantu saamaajik starikaran ek saarvbhaumik prakriya he, is baat ko sabhi sweekaar karte hai or ise sabhi maanate hai ki prayek samaaj main ek vyakti yaa samooh ko unchaa va nicha sthaan dekar uski sthiti kaa mulyankan avashya kiya jaataa he
 All societies are stratified societies
 parantu ye sabhi stareekrut samaaj ek duusare se kaaphi alag ho sakate hai kyonki un sabhi main starikaran kaa maapdand alag ho saktaa he
 Different features of the system of social stratification can be described, but in each society these characteristics work in different ways and because of this it would be appropriate to study their functional capabilities only in the context of the specific situation of those societies
 unki visheshtaon main saamaajik varg, prajati, gender, janm tathaa umr ko aadhaar banaakar adhyayan kiya gaya he
 All these elements keep their special importance in that society
 udhaaharan ke liye yah kaha ja saktaa he ki bhartiya samaaj main janm se hi jati ko kuch vishisht sthaan mil jate hai
 If a person is born in a Brahmin family, then his social position becomes high
 usee prakaar agar uskaa janm nimna jati ke harijan parivaar main hota he to uskaa sthaan nicha mana jaataa he
 Similarly, the position of a woman is considered to be of a lower level than that of men
 jabaki janajaatiy samaaj main umr ke anusaar logon ko ucch sthaan mili hote hai or vahaan stri kaa nimna sthaan nahin hota he
 Therefore, if one element becomes the main basis of stratification in one society, then the same element does not have much importance in other society
 parantu in sab ke baavjood bhi saamaajik starikaran ke kuch aise aadharbhoot tatv hai jinhen sanrachanaatmak aadhaar kaha ja saktaa he
 These elements are considered universal and distinct elements of society
 in aadharbhoot tatwon ke bare main samajashastriyon main ek aam sahmati bhi paayi jaati he
 Therefore all sociologists have also specifically mentioned these forms and basis of stratification
 ye mukhya aadharbhoot tatv hai- Sociologists consider class a major basis of social stratification
 iske saath jude saiddhanthik drushtikon ke pratipaadakon main yadhyapi germany ke samajashaastra karl marks kaa naam vishesh rup se liya jaataa he parantu unke saath hi maiks webar kaa naam bhi ullekhneey he, kyonki unhone bhi varg kii mahatvapurn bhoomika kaa varnan kiya he
 The theoretical perspectives of these two sociologists are quite different from each other
 agar koi samanta inke adhyayan main hai to sirf yah ki in donon ne poonjivadi samaaj ke sandarbh main audyogic samaaj ke swaroopon kaa adhyayan kiya he
 Marx explained class in economic terms
 ve maanate hai ki aaj tak maanav sabhyataa kaa itihaas varg sangharsh kaa itihaas rahaa he
 In his short book Communist Manifesto he describes the important role of the two classes
 ye bhi do varg hai He describes the class in terms of their authority over the means of production
 unki yah manyata thi ki utpaadan ke sadhano main parivartan ke saath-saath do varg sadaiv bane rahete hai- ek varg to vah hota he jise utpaadan ke sadhano par niyantran hota he or doosraa vah jo iske swaamitv se vanchit rahata he
 In the process of industrial development, two classes can be clearly seen in the industrial society, one class is called the capitalist class and the other is the working class
 aarthik paristhitiyaan ek duusare ke pratikul hote hai
 Where the bourgeoisie plays the role of the exploiting class due to monopoly over the means of production, on the other hand there is the working class which is deprived of the means of production and is exploited by the capitalist class
 in donon kii sthiti paraspar ek duusare ke vipareet hoti he or in donon ke paraspar virdohi aarthik swaarth ke kaaran in donon main nirantar sangharsh kii sthiti bani hoti he
 In fact, in the capitalist system, economic interests differ between these two classes
 varg chetana par aadhaarit varg sangharsh kii avadharana ke dwaara karl marcus ne saamaajik kranti kii baat kii he
 From the point of view of stratification, both the capitalist class and the working class have different social strata
 puunjipati varg apane aap ko unchaa maanakar sadaiv apni sthiti majboot karata he vahiin duusari ore majdoor varg apane sthiti ko unchaa uthaane ke liye hameshaa puunjipati varg ke utpaadan kii pranali main antardvand dekhtaa he or apni sthiti ko unchaa uthaane ke liye poonjipati dwaara kamaaye gayi munaafe main apana hissaa maangata he
 Weber also saw differences in society on an economic level based on class
 webar kaa kahana tha ki virgon ke unnati ke avasar paraspar alag-alag hote hai
 While Marx has mainly talked about two classes, Weber has talked about the following four sections - webar ne saamaajik starikaran ke sandarbh main varg ke saath-saath ek or visheshta ko pramukh bataaya, jo tha saamaajik sammaan yaa saamaajik sthiti
 Therefore Weber has used the term status group in place of class
 varg ek band samooh na hokar zyada khulaa samooh he
 It is clear from Weber's description that class should be seen as a purely economic entity and not linked to industrial society
 tii0ech marshall ne bhi sthiti samooh ki vyakhya vyaktigat tathaa sthiti ke aadhaar par kiya he
 Status group is also considered after taking into account the variation of business
 kuch samajashastriyon ne samaajik gatishiltaa kaa adhyayan unke vyavsaayik sthiti ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya he
 According to v Pareto two categories of aristocracy can be described which are as follows- shaasha abhijatya varg kii saamaajik sthiti gaiyr abhijatya varg ke saamaajik sthiti se bilkul bhinn hota he
 One has a higher place in social stratification while the other has a lower position
 parantu parato kaa maananaa tha ki donon kii sthiti main sadaiv badlaav aata rahata he
 He describes it as a cyclical principle
 aaj jo 'shaasha abhijatya varg' hai unki sthiti majboot he par sadaiv uski sthiti majboot nahin rahegi kyonki jo varg satta main nahin aa pate he ve satta main bane rahane waalon ke upar puri nigaraanee rakhte he or unke kamjor hote hi unpar haaavee ho jate hai
 His theory is called the 'rotating principle of aristocracy'
 jati par aadhaarit starikaran ko saamaajik sthiti ko samajhane kaa hi ek tatv mana jaataa he
 When the situation is completely predetermined, where it is completely impossible to change the social status of a person from where he is born, in such a situation, class takes the form of caste
 mekiver tathaa pej ke is kathan kaa samarthan karte hue kingsle davis kaa yah maananaa tha ki jati ke aadhaar par jab starikaran ke swaroop kii baat kii jaati he to do prakaar ke sthiti kaa sahaj rup se samaran ho aata he or ye donon sthitiyaan hai- pradutt sthiti tathaa arjeet sthiti 
 In the context of stratification, it can be said that the condition created by the term caste is called the given condition because it does not have mobility on the basis of it and no change can be made while the situation which is given by its opposite class is given to the person
 It can be changed and hence the class has more flexibility
 isliye jati kii vyakhya karte hue samajashaastra ise 'band samooh' kii sangya dete hai jahaan vyakti kii sthiti sthaayee rup se nishchit hoti he
 Kingsley Davis, while explaining caste, has assumed that some properties are inherited by caste - that is, inequality as inheritance
 is prakaar unka maananaa tha ki do prakaar ke saamaajik vyavastha kii baat kii ja sakati he- ek vah asamanta jo uttaradhikaar main jati ke dwaara milti he or doosraa vah jo samanta ke aadhaar par samaan avasar se judaa hota he
 Both of these represent stratification: in one, a person has the same status as his father and in the other one attains the status that his father may or may not have
 vyakti mehnat kar apane pita kii sthiti se apane aap ko or bhi upar uthaane kii sambhaavna paidaa karata he
 It can be said that the Indian caste system is an example of the first situation, while the second situation is a society based on the American class, where through hard work and hard work a person gets a higher position than his father
 jati par aadhaarit samaaj kii nimna visheshtaon kaa ullekh karnaa yahan uchit he- As far as social stratification based on class and caste is concerned - there is a belief that the earlier narrow view of caste and class has changed a lot
 bhartiya samajashaastra yah maanate hai ki jati kii sanrachana main kaaphi badlaav aayaa he or aaj jati jo swaroop hamen dekhne ko miltaa he usamen kaaphi badlaav aayaa he
 KM Sharma says that the difference based on class is found in abundance in caste
 gaanv main rahane vaale log kabhi-kabhi bhartiya varg sanrachana kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Therefore, he was of the opinion that caste and class should not be considered as opposing nature of each other
 ye donon bhartiya saamaajik vyavastha ke avibhajya pahalu he or in donon ke bich gaharaa sambandh he jiske nirantarata or parivartit swaroop kaa adhyayan kiya janaa aavashyak he
 Explaining the relation between caste and class, Yogendra Singh has said that caste and class represent only the structural element of Indian society
 varg, jati ke dhaanche ke antargat hi kaary karte hai
 MN Srinivas has also emphasized that the relationship between caste and class should not be limited to only rural and urban society and education facilities
 isamen bhoomika ko naukarshahi, majdoor union, raajnneetik dalon, shaharikaran tathaa aarthik vikaas ke kshetra main bhi dekha janaa chahie tabhi iske parivartit swaroop tathaa nirantarata ko samajha ja saktaa he
 Today, in the process of modernization, the modern form of caste has started to emerge as a committee and instead of being confined to traditional structures and cultural elements, caste is becoming an integral part of the new emerging groups and committees of the modern era and In this way, new relations are developing and the relations between caste and class have become very deep, so the identity of this composite form is given a new level

 Kant's moral opinion is called the principle of "moral purity", the principle of "duty to duty" or "rigorism"

 Emanuel Kant became famous for his propaganda that a man should do such deeds and sayings which if he does, they will be good for humanity

 The city of Königuzburg is in Russia today and is now Kaliningrad Kaliningrad
 uski praarambhik shiksha apni mata kii dekharekh main hui thi, jo apane samay ke "pavitra maarg" naamak dharmik andolan se bahut prabhavit thi
 Therefore, at an early age, he was interested in righteous conduct, simple, well-organized and professional life
 16 varsh kii aayu main, "collegium fidericaanum" kii shiksha samaapt kar, vah konigsburg ke vishvavidhyalay main pravisht hua, jahaan chah varsh usne bhautikashastra, ganit, darshan evam dharamshastra kaa adhyayan kiya
 For nine years after leaving university, Kant moved to a village called Judskin, 60 miles from Königsberg
 vahaan vah do teen pariwaron main adhyaapan kaary kar apni jeevika chalaata or bhautikashastra tathaa darshan main swadhyay karata rahaa
 In the meantime, many of his articles and epics were published, two of which are "special Considerations on the Approximation of Living Powers" and "general Natural History and Theory of the Akash"

 He had also submitted the necessary arrangements for the degree of "doctor's Legacy" in 1755 AD and the University of Königsberg certified his qualification by granting him the said degree
 kintu uski vyaktigat samasyaon main koi parivartan na hua
 Pleased with his nine years of hard work, the university had appointed him a distinguished lecturer, but he did not get paid for this work

 In 1758 AD, he prayed for the post of chief teacher of logic and philosophy, but he failed

 main use adhyaapan ke saath-saath sahaayak pustkaalay prabandhak bhi niyukt kiya gaya or ab use das pound vaarshik vetan milane laga
 For four years, Kant also worked in this form, but he continued to study, think and write
 "privet dogent" niyukt hone ke baad se 1770i tak uske paanch prakaran granth prakashit hue– The titles of the above texts suggest that the time between 1755 and 1770 AD was the creation of Kant's ideas

 In the same year, he was appointed to the same teacher of logic and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, for which he had to be disappointed 12 years ago
 pehle se ab vah chintamukt bhi ho gaya tha kyonki use 60 pound vaarshik vetan milane laga tha
 In those days, such salaries were paid only to respectable teachers
 granthon ke prakaashan se bhi koi badi dhanrashi nahin praapt hoti thi
 Kant earned only 30 pounds from his "critique of Pure Reason"

 It is considered the best philosophical treatise in Kant's adult texts
 is kaal ke anya granth "prayek bhavi darshan kii bhoomika", "nitidarshan kii prishthbhumi", "prakritik vigyaan ke darshanik aadhaar", "vyaavhaarik buddhi kii samiksha", "nirnay kii samiksha", "keval buddhi dwaara simit dharm", tathaa "shaashvat shanti par" 
 Even after 1796 AD, he was busy studying, thinking and writing, but these eight years of his life were spent in a very pathetic condition
 uski smriti itani ksheen ho gai thi ki use choti-moti baaten bhi likhakar yaad rakhni padati thim
 He did not have the power to take care of his own house; He did not marry, but during the teaching period of 42 years, he made a good impression on his colleagues and students

 a German poet named Hyne has spoken in praise of Kant's philosophical life that proves him eccentric, but his ideas have influenced the subsequent philosophy so much that Kant's scholar considers him the originator of a new era in philosophy

 The literary life of Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma starts from 1934 when he came in contact with Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala'
 isi varsh unhone apana pratham aalochanatmak lekh 'niraalaaji kii kavita' likhaa jo charchit patrika 'chaand' main prakashit hua
 After this, he was constantly oriented towards creation
 acharya ramchandra shukla ke baad dow ramvilas sharma hi ek aise aalochak ke rup main sthapit hote hai, jo bhashaa, sahitya or samaaj ko ek saath rakhkar moolyankan karte hai
 In their criticism process, there is not only literature, but they evaluate literature by taking society, meaning, politics, history together
 anya aalochakon kii tarah unhone kisi rachanaakaar kaa moolyankan keval lekhkeey kaushal ko jaanchne ke liye nahin kiya he, balki unke moolyankan kii kasuti yah hoti he ki us rachanaakaar ne apane samay ke saath kitna nyaay kiya he
 Revised-revised editions of many of these books, published later, should be read only
 ye sabhi pustaken ab raajakmal, vaani, kitabgar, hindi madhyam karyanvay nideshaalay, sahitya academy evam sahitya bhandar prakashnon se prakashit hai
 The best compilation for such a general reader who wants to read only selected passages is 'compiled essay' sharma ji par kendrit anek patrikaon ke visheshank prakashit hote rahe hai, jinamein uplabdh or vishesh pathneey hai - The concept of Hindi caste is the central point of ethnic thinking of Ram Vilas Sharma
 bhartiya sahitya ke tulanaatmak adhyayan tathaa vaishvik sahitya se antarkriya ke dwaara ramvilas ji ne sahitya ke jaateey tatwon kii pragatisheel bhoomika kii pahchaan kii he
 After Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma is established as a critic who puts language, literature and society together and assesses it
 unki aalochana prakriya main keval sahitya hi nahin hota, balki ve samaaj, arth, raajnneeti, itihaas ko ek saath lekar sahitya kaa moolyankan karte hai
 Like other critics, he has not evaluated a creator merely to test his writing skills, but his criterion of how judged the creator has been over his time
 itihaas kii samasyaon se jujhna maano unki pehali pratigya ho
 He was busy in finding a solution to every problem in Indian history
 unhone jab yah kaha ki arya bharat ke mul nivasee hai, tab iskaa virodh hua tha
 He said that Aryans have not come to India from West Asia or any other place, but the truth is that they have gone from India to West Asia
 ve likhte hai - ‘‘duusari sahastrabdi isa purv bade-bade jan abhiyaanon kii sahastrabdi he
 Meanwhile, Indian Aryan contingents spread from Iraq to Turkey
 ve apni bhashaa or samskruti kii chhap sarvatra chhodte jate hai
 The capitalist historians have shed the opposite Ganges
 jo yug aaryon ke bahirgaman kaa he, use ve bharat main unke pravesh kaa yug kehete hai
 At the same time, they try to make the present residents of West Asia lose the aspect of their ancient culture, which is related to India
 sabase pehle swayan bharatvasiyon ko yah sambandh samajhnaa he, phir use apane padosiyon ko samajhaana he
 The present social system that spreads hunger, illiteracy, superstition and new diseases has to be changed
 iske liye bharat or uske padosiyon kaa sammilit prayaas aavashyak he
 Whenever this effort takes place, it is imperative that our current relations with our neighbors will change and with them changing, they and we will recognize our old relations anew
 ateet kaa vaigyanik, vastuparak vivechan vartmaan samaaj ke punargathan ke prashn se judaa hua he

 By analyzing the structure of words and their origin, they come to the conclusion that the language of the Aryans has a profound influence on the languages of Europe and West Asia
 ve likhte hai - ‘‘san 1786 main greek, latin or sanskrit ke vidwaan wiliam jones ne kaha tha, ‘greek kii apeksha sanskrit adhik purna he
 Both are more affluent than Latin and both are more refined than either
 ’ par donon se kriyamoolon or vyakaran roopon main uskaa itnaa gaharaa sambandh he, jitna akasmaat utpann nahin ho saktaa
 This relationship is indeed so clear that no philologist can examine these three without believing that they were born from the same source
 jo strot shaayad ab vidyaman nahin he
 After this, the notion of a large indo-european family by combining language currencies such as German, Slavic, Kelat etc
 as branches of a source language was presented
 19veen sadi ke purvarddh main tulanaatmak or aitihaasik bhashaa vigyaan ne baari pragati kii he
 Apart from knowing about their development and mutual relations of many new and old languages, the beliefs prevailing about the ancient history of many countries are the result of this historical linguistics
 aarambh main europe ke vidwaan maanate the ki unki bhashaaon ko janm dene vaali strot bhashaa kaa gaharaa sambandh bharat se he
 This belief is also in an Indian article by Marx
 ’’ Wishing for the liberation of the Indian public from British domination, he wrote in 1833, "we can certainly hope to see a revival of that great and interesting country in the most remote period, where the words of the gentleman resident Prince Saltykov i am more clever and efficient than the Italian people, whose subordination is also balanced by a quiet dignity, who despite their innate laziness Rays officials have been amazed by his bravery, whose country is our languages, is the origin of our religions and where the ancient German in the format race, the nature of ancient Greece reflect Brahyan
 ’’ Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma evaluates Indian contexts from a Marxist point of view, but he himself prides himself on these values, while simultaneously telling his readers that India is a very ancient nation in terms of language and literature and thinking
 ve angrejon dwaara likhwaaye gaye bhartiya itihaas ko ek shadyantr maanate hai
 He says that if we have to evaluate the history of India correctly, then we have to study our ancient texts
 angrejon ne jaan-boojhkar bhartiya itihaas ko nasht kiya he
 Only by doing this they could rule this great nation
 bharat main vyaapt jati, dharm ke algaav kaa jitna gaharaa prakatikaran angrejon ke aane ke baad hota he, utana gaharaa prabhaav pehle ke itihaas main maujuud nahin he
 Only by dividing the society, the British could rule this great nation and they have done the same
 puraskaron main praapt raashiyon ko unhone kabhi sweekaar nahin kiya
 Asked to apply those zodiac signs to the development of Hindi
 2012-2013 ramvilas sharma kaa janm-shatabdi varsh tha
 While giving his lecture on Ram Vilas Sharma, Veer Bharat Talwar had said that the death of Ram Vilas Sharma had shaken the Hindi media
 ve kehete hai- From this we can infer both Ram Vilas Sharma's popularity and the loss of his passing
 1764 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 1764 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the birth of Jesus

 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method

 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Balian refuses and returns to the crusade
 baad main, shahar ke purohit, baalion ke sautele bhai ne bataaya ki usne dafan karne ke pehle baalion kii patni kaa sar kaatane kaa aadesh diya tha 
 Balian then discovers that his brother is the first of the same cross that his wife wore before being buried

 At Messina, dying Godfrey knighted Balian and ordered him to serve the King of Jerusalem and protect the helpless

 However, the performance of leading actor Arlando Blume has generally been revealed by American critics such as "boston Glob", saying that Blume "has not been as bad as Ebalin's Balian, but the man has never seemed like such a man
" The one who holds the fort for a real star is not seen "

 The Government of India has also declared Kannada as a classical language of India
 kannada tathaa karnataka shabdon kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main bhinn-bhinn mat hai
 If a scholar is of the opinion that the word Kannada is derived from "kaniruduanadu" meaning "black clay country", then according to other scholars, "kannadu" from "kapitu Nadu" means "fragrant country" and "kannadu" from "kannadu"
 Derivation has taken place

 Some grammars state that Kannada is a form of the Sanskrit word "karnat"
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki "karnayo atati iti karnataka" arthath jo kaanon main goonjataa he vah karnataka he
 In ancient texts, the words Kannada, Karnat, Karnataka have been used in synonyms

 Thus even though there is evidence of prose-poetry in Kannada based on inscriptions dating back to the 8th century, the work of writing in Kannada progressed after the name of the first available Kannada text, "kaviraj Marg", and the language continued to develop

 Sir Humphrey Davy tried to separate the metal from alumia soil in 1807, but was not successful
 san 1825 main arsted ne aluminium chloride ko potacium sanras ke saath garam kiya or phir aswan karke paare ko uda diya
 There was a sparkle of metal in the powder that remained after doing this
 yahi dhaatu aluminium kahalaai
 In 1845, Frederick Wöhler used potassium metal as a reducing agent in the preparation of this metal
 use is dhaatu ke kuch chote-chote kan mili, jinaki pariksha karke usne bataaya ki yah nai dhaatu bahut halki he or iske taar khinche ja sakate hai
 Subsequently, in 1854, Devil prepared a good amount of this metal using sodium and sodium aluminum chloride
 us samay nai dhaatu hone ke kaaran aluminium kii ginati bahumoolya dhaatuon main kii jaati thi or iskaa upyog abharanon or alankaaron main hota tha
 In 1886, Charles Martin Hall in Ohio City isolated alumina mixtures in a smelled cryolite and an aluminum metal from it by electrification
