 Rama is recognized as an incarnation of God in ancient India
 hindu dharm main ram vishnu ke das avtaron main se saatven avatar hai
 The life and might of Rama is described as the Sanskrit epic Ramayana composed by Maharishi Valmiki
 goswami tulsidas ne bhi unke jivan par kendrit bhakthibhaavpurn suprasiddh mahakavy shri ramcharitamanas kii rachana kii he
 Apart from these two, Ramayana has also been composed in other Indian languages, which are also very famous
 khaas taur par uttar bharat main ram atyant poojyaneey hai or adarsh purush hai
 They are also embellished with the term Purushottam
 ram, ayodhya ke raja dasharath or rani kaushalya ke sabase bade putr the
 Ram's wife was named Sita and had three brothers - Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna
 hanuman, bhagwaan ram ke, sabase bade bhakt maane jate hai
 Rama killed Ravana, the king of Lanka
 ram kii pratishtha maryaada purushottam ke rup main he
 Rama left the kingdom, friends, parents, even wife to follow decorum
 inkaa parivaar adarsh bhartiya parivaar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Ram was born in Raghukul, whose tradition was that of Pran Jahun Baru Bachnu Na Jai
 shriram ke pita dasharath ne unki sauteli mata kaikeyi ko unki kinhin do ichchhaaon ko puraa karne kaa vachan diya tha
 Kaikeyi came under the guise of maid Manthara as these vars asked King Dasaratha for his son Bharata for the throne of Ayodhya and fourteen years of exile for Rama
 pita ke vachan kii raksha ke liye ram ne khushi se chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas sweekaar kiya
 Wife Sita thought it appropriate to go to the forest with her husband, giving the example of the ideal wife
 bhai lakshmana ne bhi ram ke saath chaudaa varsh van main bitaye
 Bharata rejects Mata's order for justice and goes to the elder brother Rama in the forest and brings him to his feet
 phir ise hi raaj gaddi par rakh kar rajkaaj kiya
 When Ram was a forest dweller, his wife Sita took Ravana away
 jangal main ram ko hanuman jaisaa mitra or bhakt mila jisane ram ke saare kaary puure karaaye
 Rama finds Sita with the help of monkeys
 samudr main pul bana kar lanka pahunche tathaa ravan ke saath yuddh kiya
 After killing him, bring Sita back
 ram ke ayodhya lautne par bharat ne rajya unako hi saunp diya
 Ram was justice-loving
 unhone bahut acha shashan kiya isliye log aaj bhi achche shashan ko raamarajy kii upama dete hai
 His two sons Kush and Love handled their kingdoms
 hindu dharm ke kai tyohaar, jaise dashahra, ram navami or deepawali, ram kii jivan-katha se jude hue hai
 The word 'ram' is derived from the addition of the suffix 'ghan' in 'rum' metal
 'ram' dhaatu kaa arth raman karne se sambaddh he
 They 'raman' in the heart of a creature, therefore 'ram' and devotees 'raman' in them, therefore they are also 'ram'
 'vishnusahasranam' par likhit apane bhashya main aadya shankaracharya ne padmapurana kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki nityanandswarup bhagavan main yogijan raman karte hai, isliye ve 'ram' hai
 Rama is not mentioned in Vedic literature in the prevailing form
 rugveda main keval do sthalon par hi 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 One of them has been used in the meaning of black in one place and the remaining one in the meaning of person; But there is also no indication of his being an avatar man or Dasaratha-son
 yadhyapi nilkanth chaturdhar ne rugveda ke anek mantron ko swavivek se chunakar unke ramakthaparak arth kiye hai, parantu yah unki nijee manyata he
 The Ramakathaparaka meaning of those mantras has not been proved by any indication or any other commentary received in those cases of Rigveda itself
 rugveda main ek sthal par 'ikshvakuh' kaa tathaa ek sthal par 'dasharath' shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But there is no indication of his association with Rama
 brahman sahitya main 'ram' shabd kaa prayog aitarey brahman main do sthalon par hua he; parantu vahaan unhen 'raamo margveyah' kaha gaya he, jiskaa arth acharya sayan ke anusaar 'mrigavu' naamak stri kaa putr he
 The word 'ram' is used at a place in the Shatapatha Brahmin
 yahan 'ram' yajna ke acharya ke rup main he tathaa unhen 'ram auptpasvini' kaha gaya he
 This means that the incarnation of the prevalent Rama is due to the Valmiki Ramayana and the Puranas

 Here only the position of Jupiter and Moon are clear
 brihaspati ucchsth he tathaa chandramaa swagruhi
 Further in the fifteenth verse, the Sun is mentioned to be high
 is prakaar brihaspati tathaa surya ke ucch hone kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Mercury is always near the Sun
 atah surya ke ucch hone par buddha kaa ucch hona asambhav he
 In this way, the remaining three planets - Mars, Venus and Saturn are left to grow higher
 isi kaaran se praayah sabhi vidwaanon ne ram-janm ke samay main surya, mangal, brihaspati, shukr tathaa shani ko ucch main sthit mana he
 Traditionally, Rama's birth is believed to be in Treta Yuga
 hindu dharamshastron main, visheshtah puranic sahitya main uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar ek chaturyugi main 43,20,000 varsh hote hai, jinamein kaliyug ke 4,32,000 varsh tathaa dwapar ke 8,64,000 varsh hote hai
 Rama was born in Treta Yug i
e
 before Dwapara
 chunki kaliyug kaa abhi prarambh hi hua he or ram kaa janm treta ke ant main hua tathaa avatar lekar dharti par unke vartmaan rahane kaa samay paramparaagat rup se 11,000 varsh mana gaya he
 Hence 8,64,000 years of Dwapara Yuga + 11,000 years of Rama's existence + 5,100 years since the end of Dwapara Yuga = 8,80,100 years in total
 atev paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm aaj se lagbhag 8,80,100 varsh pehle mana jaataa he
 Eminent Marathi researcher scholar Dr
 Padmakar Vishnu Vartak has considered this time probable from a point of view
 unka kahana he ki valmikiy ramayana main ek sthal par vindhyachal tathaa himalay kii oonchaai ko samaan bataaya gaya he
 The height of Vindhyachal is 5,000 feet and it is almost constant, while the height of the Himalayas is currently 29,029 feet and it is continuously growing
 donon kii oonchaai kaa antar 24,029 feet he
 According to experts, the Himalayas grow 3 feet in 100 years
 atah 24,029 feet badhane main himalay ko kareeb 8,01,000 varsh lage honge
 Hence, the height of the Himalayas must have been similar to that of Vindhyachal, about 8,01,000 years ago, which is mentioned in the present-day form in Valmiki Ramayana
 is tarah da0 vartak ko ek drushti se yah samay sambhav lagata he, parantu unka swayan maananaa he ki ve kisi anya strot se is samay kii pushti nahin kar sakate hai
 In his well-known treatise 'vaastav Ramayana', Dr
 Vartak has done the math on the basis of the planets, according to the planetary position mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana, to determine the actual birth date of Rama on 4 December 7323 BC
 unke anusaar isi tithi ko din main 1:30 se 3:00 baje ke bich ram kaa janm hua hoga
 After several years of research by Dr
 p
v
vartak, a research team of 'i-serve' proved Shri Ram's birth on 10 January 5114 BC using 'planetarium Gold' software
 unka maananaa tha ki is tithi ko grahon kii vahi sthiti thi jiskaa varnan valmikiy ramayana main he
 But this time has become very suspicious
 'ai-sarv' ke shodh dal ne jis 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog kiya vah vastav main isa purv 3000 se pehle kaa sahi grah-ganit karne main sakasham nahin he
 In fact, before 2013, there was no available software capable of doing so much earlier planetary mathematics
 is gananaa dwaara praapt grah-sthiti main shani vrishchik main tha arthath ucch main nahin tha
 The moon was not in Punarvasu Nakshatra but was in the second phase of Pushya and the date was also Ashtami
 baad main anya visheshgy dwaara ejplde431 software dwaara kii gayi sahi gananaa main tithi to navami ho jaati he parantu shani vrishchik main hi aata he tathaa chandramaa pushya ke chaturth charan main
 Therefore, the date of 10 January 5114 BCE is virtually not proved to be the birth date of Shri Ram
 aisi sthiti main ab yadi dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak dwaara pehle hi parishodhit tithi software dwaara pramanit ho jaae tabhi shriram kaa vaastavik samay praayah sarvamaanya ho paaegaa athwa pramanit na ho paane kii sthiti main naveen tithi ke shodh kaa rasta khulegaa
 There is clear evidence about the birth of Shri Ram in the Puranas that Shri Ram was born in a city called Ayodhya in Faizabad district of present-day Uttar Pradesh
 ayodhya jo ki bhagwaan ram ke purvajon kii hi rajdhani thi
 Raghu was the ancestor of Ramchandra ji
 ram bachapan se hi shant swabhaav ke vir purush the
 He always gave dignity the highest position
 isi kaaran unhen maryaada purushottam ram ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 His kingdom was considered fair and prosperous
 isliye bharat main jab bhi suraaj kii baat hoti he to ramraj yaa raamarajy kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 Rama, who followed the path of religion, received education from Guru Vasistha along with his three brothers
 kishoravastha main guru vishwamitra unhen van main rakshason dwaara machaae ja rahe utpaat ko samaapt karne ke liye saath le gayi
 Rama was accompanied by his younger brother Lakshmana in this task
 tadka naamak rakshasi baxur main rahati thi
 He was killed there
 ram ne us samay tadka naamak rakshasi ko maaraa tathaa marich ko palaayan ke liye majaboor kiya
 During this time, Guru Vishwamitra took him to Mithila
 vahaan ke videh raja janak ne apni putree sita ke vivaah ke liye ek swayamvar samaaroh yojit kiya tha
 Where Lord Shiva had a bow whose Sita was to be married to the knight who donated the emblem
 bahut saare raja maharaja us samaaroh main padhaare the
 When many kings tried to put a bow on the bow even after trying, they could not even lift it, then Rama tried to offer the bow by raising Vishwamitra's command
 unki pratyancha chadhaane ke praytn main vah mahaan dhanush ghor dhwani karte hue tut gaya
 When Maharishi Parashurama heard this loud sound, he came there and started expressing anger at his Guru's bow breaking
 lakshmana ugr swabhaav ke the
 He had a dispute with Parashurama
 tab ram ne bich-bachaav kiya
 Thus Sita was married to Rama and was blessed by all people including Parashurama
 ayodhya main ram sita sukhpurvak rahane lage
 People wanted Rama very much
 unki mridul, janasevayukta bhaavana or nyaaypriyata ke kaaran unki vishesh lokapriyata thi
 King Dasharatha was heading towards Vanaprastha
 at: unhone rajyabhaar ram ko saunpne kaa sochaa
 There was also a pleasant wave in public that their beloved king is about to appoint their beloved prince as king
 us samay ram ke anya do bhai bharat or shatrughna apane nanihaal kaikey gaye hue the
 Kaikeyi's maid Manthara misleads Kaikeyi that the king is doing wrong with you
 tum raja kii priy rani ho to tumhaari santan ko raja bananaa chahie par raja dasharath ram ko raja bananaa chaahate hai
 a detailed account of Rama's childhood is found in the Balakanda of Swami Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas
 raja dasharath ke teen raniyaan thim: kaushalya, sumitra or kaikeyi
 Ram was the son of Kaushalya, Sumitra had two sons, Lakshmana and Shatrughna and Kaikeyi's son Bharata
 rajya niyamo se raja kaa jyeshtha ladkaa hi raja banane kaa paatr hota he at: ram ko ayodhya kaa raja bananaa nishchit tha
 Kaikeyi who twice saved Dasharatha's life and Dasaratha gave her the boon that she could ask for two brides at any moment of her life
 ram ko raja banate hue or bhavishya ko dekhte hue kaikeyi chaahati thi uskaa putr bharat hi raja bane, isliye unhone raja dasharath dwaara ram ko 14 varsh kaa vanvaas dilaayaa or apane putr bharat ke liye ayodhya kaa rajya maang liya
 In the verses, the king Dasaratha was forced to accept this
 ram ne apane pita kii ajna kaa paalan kiya
 Ram's wife Sita and her brother Lakshmana also went to exile
 vanvaas ke samay, ravan ne sita kaa haran kiya tha
 Ravana was a demon and the king of Lanka
 ramayana ke anusaar, jab ram, sita or lakshmana kutiyaa main the tab ek hiran kii vaani sunakar sita vyakul ho gayi
 That deer was Ravana's maternal uncle Marich
 usne ravan ke kehane par sunahare hiran kaa rup banaaya
 Sita was fascinated to see him and requested Shriram to hunt the deer
 shriram apni bharya kii ichha puri karne chal pade or lakshmana se sita kii raksha karne ko kaha| marich shriram ko bahut dur le gaya
 On getting the opportunity, Shriram shot an arrow and killed the deer Marich
 marate-marate marich ne jor se "he sita! he lakshmana!" kii awaz lagaayi| us awaz ko sun sita chintit ho gayin or unhone lakshmana ko shriram ke paas jane ko kaha| lakshmana janaa nahin chaahate the, par apni bhabhi kii baat ko inkaar na kar sake
 Laxman drew a line before leaving, which is popularly known as Laxman Rekha
 ram, apane bhai lakshmana ke saath sita kii khoj main dar-dar bhatak rahe the
 Then they met two apes named Hanuman and Sugriva
 hanuman, ram ke sabase bade bhakt bane
 In order to reclaim Sita, Bhagavan Rama defeated Hanuman, Vibhishana and the monkey army with the help of Hanuman, Vibhishana and Vanara Sena, and on returning, guided Vibhishan to the good ruler by making him the king of Lanka
 bhagwaan ram ne jab ravan ko yuddh main parrast kiya or uske chote bhai vibhishana ko lanka kaa raja bana diya
 Ram, Sita, Lakshman and some monkeys departed from the Pushpak plane towards Ayodhya
 vahaan sabase milane ke baad ram or sita kaa ayodhya main rajbhishek hua
 The entire state started spending efficient time
 sita kii sati pramanikta siddh hone ke pashchaat sita apane donon putron kush or lav ko ram ke god main saunp kar dharti mata ke saath bhugarbha main chali gai
 Thereafter, the life of Ram's birth was also completed

 samudr manthan ek prasiddh hindu dharmpuranic katha he
 This story comes in the Bhagavata Purana, Mahabharata and Vishnu Purana
 shri shukdev ji bole, "he rajan! raja bali ke rajya main daitya, asur tathaa daanav ati prabal ho uthe the
 He had the power of Shukracharya
 isi bich durvasa rishi ke shaap se devraj indra shaktiheen ho gayi the
 The kingdom of the demon king Bali was on all three worlds
 indra sahit devatagan usase bhaybheet rahete the
 Only Baikunthanath Vishnu could tell the solution of this situation, so all the gods along with Brahma reached Lord Narayana
 unki stuti karke unhone bhagwaan vishnu ko apni vipadaa sunai
 Then God said in sweet voice that this is a time of crisis for you
 daityon, asuron evam daanvon kaa abhyutthan ho rahaa he or tum logon kii avnati ho rahi he
 But the crisis period should be spent in a friendly manner
 tum daityon se mitrataa kar lo or ksheer sagar ko math kar usamen se amrit nikaal kar paan kar lo
 With the help of the demons, this work will be done smoothly
 is kaary ke liye unki har shart maan lo or ant main apana kaam nikaal lo
 By drinking nectar you will become immortal and you will have the ability to kill the demons
 "bhagwaan ke aadeshaanusaar indra ne samudr manthan se amrit nikalne kii baat bali ko bataaya
 The demon king Bali compromised with Devraj Indra and got ready for churning the sea
 mandarachal parvat ko mathni tathaa vasuki naag ko neti banaaya gaya
 The leader emerged from Vasuki's eye
 swayan bhagwaan shri vishnu kacchap avatar lekar mandarachal parvat ko apane peeth par rakhkar uskaa aadhaar ban gayi
 Lord Narayana exerted power demonically in the demons and devoutly in the gods
 vasuki naag ko bhi gahan nidra de kar uske ksht ko har liya
 The god began to hold Vasuki Nag on his face
 is par ulti buddhi vaale daitya, asur, daanavaadi ne sochaa ki vasuki naag ko mukh kii ore se pakadaney main avashya kuch na kuch laabh hoga
 He told the gods that we are not inferior in power to anyone, we will take the place of mouth
 tab devataaon ne vasuki naag ke punch kii ore kaa sthaan le liya
 "the sea churning began and the Mandarachal mountain began to roam on the broad back of the Lord Kachhapa
 he rajan! samudr manthan se sabase pehle jal kaa halaahal vish niklaa
 All the gods and demons started burning with the flame of that poison and their ears began to fade
 is par sabhi ne milakar bhagwaan shankar kii prarthana kii
 On his prayer, Mahadev ji kept the poison on his palm and drank it but did not let it come down from the gorge
 us kalkut vish ke prabhaav se shiv ji kaa kanth nila pad gaya
 That is why Mahadev ji is called Neelkanth
 unki hatheli se thodaa sa vish prithvi par tapak gaya tha jise saanp, bichchhu aadi vifaille jantuon ne grahan kar liya
 "after consuming the poison by Lord Shankar, the ocean churning started again
 doosraa ratna kamdhenu gaay nikali jise rishiyon ne rakh liya
 Then a high horse came out which was kept by Daityaraja Bali
 uske baad airavat hathi niklaa jise devraj indra ne grahan kiya
 After Airavat, Lord Vishnu kept it out of the sea of kaustubhamani
 phir kalpavriksha niklaa or rambha naamak apsara nikali
 These two were kept in heaven
 aage phir samudr ko mathne se lakshmi ji nikaleen
 Laxmi ji got married to Lord Vishnu himself
 uske baad kanya ke rup main vaaruni prakat hai jise daityon ne grahan kiya
 Then after one moon, Parijat tree and conch came out and in the end Dhanvantari Vaidya appeared after taking the nectar
 "dhanvantari ke haath se amrit ko daityon ne chin liya or uske liye aapas main hi ladane lage
 The gods did not have the power to curse Durvasa so that they could fight the demons and take that nectar, so they stood frustrated and watched them fight among themselves
 devataaon kii niraashaa ko dekhakar bhagwaan vishnu tatkaal mohini rup dhaaran kar aapas main ladate daityon ke paas ja pahunche
 Seeing that Vishwamohini form, what is the matter of the demons and the Gods, the Brahmins, the devouring Kamdev himself, Lord Shankar too were fascinated and looked at him again and again
 jab daityon ne us navyauvana sundari ko apni ore aate huye dekha tab ve apana sara jhagada bhul kar usee sundari kii ore kamaskt hokar ekatak dekhne lage
 The monster said, "oh beautiful! Who are you? Looks like we are being sarcastic on us only to settle our dispute
 aao shubhage! tumhaara swaagat he
 Make us beautiful and make this nectar with lotus
 " is par vishwamohini rupi vishnu ne kaha, "he devataaon or daanvon! aap donon hi maharishi kashyap ji ke putr hone ke kaaran bhai-bhai ho phir bhi paraspar ladate ho
 i am an arbitrary woman
 budhimaan log aisi stri par kabhi vishwaas nahin karte, phir tum log kaise mujh par vishwaas kar rahe ho? acha yahi he ki swayan sab mil kar amritpan kar lo
 " vishwamohini ke aise niti kushal vachan sun kar un kamandh daityo, daanvon or asuron ko us par or bhi vishwaas ho gaya
 He said, "beautiful! We have full faith in you
 tum jis prakaar baantogi ham usee prakaar amritpan kar lenge
 Take this event and distribute nectar among all of us
 " vishwamohini ne amrit ghat lekar devataaon or daityon ko alag-alag panktiyo main baithne ke liye kaha
 After that, the demons plastered with their sarcasm and began to make nectar to the gods
 daitya unke kataaksh se aise madahosh huye ki amrit pinaa hi bhul gayi
 God considered this trick as a monster named Rahu
 vah devtaa kaa rup bana kar devataaon main jaakar baith gaya or praapt amrit ko mukh main daal liya
 When the nectar reached its gorge, the moon and the sun called out and said that it is Rahu monster
 yah sunakar bhagwaan vishnu ne tatkaal apane sudarshan chakra se uskaa sir gardan se alag kar diya
 Due to the effect of nectar, his head and torso became two planets named Rahu and Ketu and were established in space
 ve hi bair bhav ke kaaran surya or chandramaa kaa grahan karaate hai
 In this way, Lord Vishnu was omitted from there by giving nectar to the gods
 unke lop hote hi daityon kii madhoshi samaapt ho gai
 They became very angry and started attacking the gods
 bhayankar devasur sangram armbh ho gaya jisamen devraj indra ne daityaraj baali ko parrast kar apana indralok waapas le liya

 Delegation of specific power and authority by a superior officer to a subordinate officer is called delegation
 yah prabandhan ke mul sankalpanaaon main se ek he
 It is worth noting that the same person is responsible for the outcome of the work, who assigns his rights to the other person for performing that work
 pratyaayojan ke falswaroop adhinsth vyakti ko nirnay lene main suvidha hoti he
 On the other hand, the officer's load is reduced somewhat
 arthath pratyaayojan prashasnic sanghathan main vibhinn staron par shaktiyon evam dayitvon ke anaavashyak tehraav ko rokane kii ek aantarik prashasnic prakriya he
 The authority remains the authority to control, supervise and supervise subordinates
 satta hastaantarit karne vaala adhikari apane dayitvon tathaa javabdehita se mukt nahin ho saktaa
 In another sense, delegation is a way of distributing tasks to subordinates and getting them done
 pratyaayojan prashasnic sanghathan kii ek mahatvapurn visheshta he
 In the absence of delegation, no administrative organization can easily achieve its stated objective
 pratyaayojan ko sthaanantaran, pratyaadhikaran, pratyaadhikaar, athwa adhinsth pratyaayojan ityadi kai naamon se janaa jaataa he
 Delegation is a Hindi translation of the English word Delegation, which is derived from Delegate
 iskaa arth he 'pratinidhi'
 The present time is the time of large organizations
 sanghathan na keval bade he inaki kaary prakriyaayein bhi jatil ho gayi hai
 Employees working at every level of the organization are becoming overpriced
 visheshkar santhnik padsopan ke ucchtar staron par kaarybhaar itnaa adhik hota ja rahaa he ki ucch adhikari sanghathan kii maang ke anusaar unke nistaaran main asamarth hai jiske parinamswaroop santhnik vilambta kii samasya paidaa hoti he
 The principle of delegation in the organization is basically related to the allocation of rights and responsibilities from top to bottom
 isiilie santhnik jatilta or vikaas ke saath saath pratyaayojan kii aavashyaktaa bhi badhati ja rahi he jo ki prayek sanghathan ke liye upyogi he

 According to D
 White, vidwaanon ne samay-samay par pratyaayojan nimnlikhit rup main paribhaashit kiya he- According to the moon milate ke anusaar, In the words of Douglas C
 Basil, jorge aar
 terry ke anusaar, Based on the various definitions, some of the features written about delegation can be specified which are as follows: swatantra rup se kaary karne ko praadhikrut : pratyaayojan kii sahaayta se sanghathan main ek prashaasak ko varisht adhikari dwaara nirdhaarit seemaa main rahete hue swatantra rup se kaary karneka avasar diya jaataa he
 But while working in that range, one cannot behave in a free way
 pratyaayojan kii sahaayta se samvidhan, sanghathan kii niti, niyam, upanium aadi kii sanrachana va seemaa main rahakar swavivek kaa prayog karneka adhikaar miltaa he
 Delegation is art: Under the administrative organization, the officer, when and how much power is to be given and how the control is to be established, it is decided by the delegating officer
 pratyaayojan likhit yaa alikhit or vishisht yaa saamaanya prakruti kaa : prashasnic sanghathan main pratyaayojan likhit yaa alikhit koi bhi ho saktaa he
 From the point of view of work, the more written the organization, the more clarity remains
 lekin bahut sa pratyyojit hissaa vyaavhaarik rup main alikhit hi rahata he
 When a specific procedure is set for organizational goals, it is called a specific delegation and when a procedure is not determined even when the goal is set, it is called a delegation of general nature
 sampoorn satta pratyyojit nahin : koi bhi vyakti apni sampoorn sattaaka pratyaayojan nahin kar saktaa he, balki aanshik maatra main hi pratyaayojan hota he
 Dual format: Delegation entrusts its work and authority to others, but also keeps many rights
 terry ke shabdon main, yah prakriya usee prakaar kii he jaise ki dusron ko gyaan baantate samay, dusron ko gyaan bhi mil jaataa he tathaa baantne vaale ke paas bhi gyaan rahata he
 After handing over the power, it can be reduced and withdrawn: Delegation is not permanent in its nature
 jabaki usamen sanshodhan kiya ja saktaa he
 It can be done more or less or withdrawn
 yah sab paristhiti, kaary or aavashyaktaa par nirbhar karata he
 No higher officer can delegate the following work - mohit bhattacharya ne pratyaayojan kii prakriya ko is prakaar spasht kiya he- Delegation is different from decentralization, transfer and decriminalization, which also implies the transfer of authority
 visankendran prashasnic kaarywahi par, hastantaran raajnneetik or nyaayik kaarywahi par or vikendrikaran raajnneetik kanoonee or prashasnic kaarywahi par aadhaarit he
 Just as Panchayati Raj means decentralization, while the office of District Collector means decontamination, transfer of authority from the Center to the States
 kisi bhi sanghathan ko prabhavi rup se sanchalit karne ke liye, jisase ki vah apane vaanchit uddeshyon kii prapti kar sake, yah aavashyak he ki use praapt shaktiyon ko vibhinn staron par karyrat vibhinn carmikon ke madhya vibhajit or hastaantarit kiya jaae
 Regarding the need, utility and importance of delegation
 D
 White wrote that nimnlikhit tathyon se pratyaayojan kii aavashyaktaa atyadhik badi he or yah tathy pratyaayojan ke mahatv ko bhi spasht karte he: For quick decision: There are some tasks at various levels of administrative organization that require quick decision making
 satta kaa pratyaayojan is kaary ko saral bana detaa he kyonki adhinsthon ko bhi simit kshetra main nirnay lene kaa adhikaar soup diya jaataa he
 Decisions are taken immediately regarding small tasks
 kabhi-kabhi prashaskeey sanghathanon main kuch aisi apatkaaleen paristhitiyaan utpann ho jaati hai jiske liye apatkaaleen nirnay kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It takes so long to get orders from their headquarters that it is too late, so in such a situation the delegated officers are able to take quick decisions
 mitvyayta evam kushalta : pratyaayojan se nirnyon main shighrata aati he kyonki nirnay ke prashasnic str kam ho jate hai
 Prompt and effective decisions increase economy and efficiency in the organization
 kaaryon tathaa adhikaron kaa vibhaajan hone se ucchadhikari ke saamne niyatrann or nirdesan kii spashtataa rahati he
 To reduce the burden of work: At present, not only has there been a large increase in population in different countries, but the burden of work has increased continuously
 sarkari prashasan par itane kaary batch gayi hai vah kisi bhi vibhaag kaa kaary kisi ek adhikari ke dwaara sampann nahin kara saktaa he
 It becomes necessary to transfer power to the various authorities located on the footsteps so that the workload can be lightened
 samay kii bachat : ucch sattadhari ke paas sanghathan yaa ikai kii mahatvapurn jimmedaariyaan hoti hai
 Policy-making and planning are key among these responsibilities
 pratyaayojan ke antargat ucchadhikari dwaara mahatv ke kaaryon ke atirikt anya kaary adhinsth ko soup diye jate hai, jisase ucchadhikari ko mahatvapurn nirnay lene main saralata rahati he tathaa kaaryon kaa nishpaadan aasaani se ho jaataa he
 To provide training opportunity: Whenever new responsibilities are delegated as a result of delegation to subordinate employees, they work with a sense of responsibility and they get training by this task
 satta ke pratyaayojan ke falswaroop adhinsth karmchaariyon ko kaary karne kaa jo avasar praapt hota he uski vajah se unki sakriyata badhati he, anubhav main vruddhi hoti he tathaa bhavi uttardayitvon ke liye ve prashikshan praapt karte he
 To facilitate direction, control and supervision: The delegation of power at different levels of footsteps in the administrative organization facilitates the direction of directing, controlling and supervising
 satta kaa pratyaayojan yojanabaddh dhang se hota he
 In this, it is clearly determined which work is to be done within which limits
 jo ucchadhikari apane adhinsth ko satta pratyyojit karata he, uske paas us kaary se sambandhit nirdesan, niyantran or paryvekshan ke adhikaar bane rahete hai
 If there is any disturbance, repetition or chaos in the administrative work, then the person responsible for this is easily discovered
 sanghathanaatmak lochashiltaa hetu : kathorta, jadta tathaa roodhiwaadita kisi bhi sanghathan kii kaarykushalta evam vikaas ke liye baadhak hai
 In order to adapt the organization to the changing circumstances and to develop the personnel it is necessary that the organization must have flexibility so that fresh air will come
 navachaar tathaa pratyaayojan ke dwaara jadta ko todaa ja saktaa he tathaa sanghathanaatmak uddeshyon kii prapti behatar dhang se ho sakati he
 Increase in moral level and morale: Delegation increases the morale of subordinates, because by delegating rights and responsibilities to subordinates, they understand the importance of their position and work with full devotion

 Assistance in succession: There is a deep connection between delegation and succession
 ek prashaasak pratyaayojan ke jariye apane uttaradhikari ke liye rasta banaata he
 That is, when one administrator is removed, another can take his place
 irvin hascale shell ke shabdon main, Delegations are also helpful in the selection of successors and continuity of ideals
 prayek sanghathan ke kuch adarsh hote he or prashaasak badalane par bhi ve adarsh jyon ke tyon maujuud rahete hai
 Delegation can be divided into several types depending on the nature of work, nature of authority, formalities and procedures etc
 likhit athwa maukhik pratyaayojan : likhit pratyaayojan vidhiwat tathaa likhit adeshon se kiya jaataa he jo praaia: aupchaarik, mahatvapurn tathaa sthaayee bhi hota he jabaki maukhik pratyaayojan kam mahatv ke maamle athwa taatkaalik prakruti ke kaaryon ke bare main maukhik rup se kiya jaataa he
 General or Special Delegation: When a person is assigned the charge of all the activities of a department, it is called General Delegation
 iske vipareet jab kisi vyakti ko puraa kaary na saunpkar koi vishisht kaary saunpejate he to yah vishisht pratyaayojan kehalaata he
 Full or partial delegation: In full delegation the ruling delegates its full authority
 aise pratyaayojan kaa udhaaharan anterrashtriya sammelnon main bheje jane vaale pratinidhimandal kaa adhikaar he
 a government gives full authority and sends the delegation to the conference
 pratinidhi mandal jo bhi sweekruti detaa he shashan kii ore se hi detaa he
 But normally the delegation is only partial
 sattadhari apni purna satta kaa pratyaayojan na kar aanshik satta kaa hi pratyaayojan karata he
 Direct or indirect delegation: Direct delegation is one in which the UB officer delegates some part of his power directly to his subordinate
 un donon ke bich koi jodne vaali kadi nahin hoti
 In indirect delegation, there is one or more intermediaries between the power giver and the taker, and the higher official transfers his power to the one who receives the power through those arbitrators
 aupchaarik or anaupchaarik pratyaayojan : jab sanghathan ke likhit niyamon, upaniyamon, adeshon yaa prakriyaaon ke anusaar pratyaayojan kiya jaataa he to vah aupchaarik pratyaayojan kehalaata he
 On the other hand, delegation based on the informal traditions, customs and mutual harmony of the organization is called informal delegation
 sthaayee or asthaayee pratyaayojan : jab kisi adhinsth vyakti yaa ikai ko sthaayee rup main satta evam kaary de die jate hai to sthaayee pratyaayojan kehalaata he
 Permanent delegation may also take place under normal conditions and efficient working conditions
 lekin jab kisi ko kuch samay ke liye pratyaayojan kiya jaataa he tathaa vaapis le liya jaataa he to yah asthaayee pratyaayojan kehalaata he
 Conditional or unconditional delegation: Delegation of power can also be conditional and unconditional
 sashart pratyaayojan main satta ke pratyaayojan ke saath kuch sharten laga di jaati he or un sharton ko puraa karnaa adhinsth ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he
 No condition is laid in the unconditional delegation and the subordinate officer has complete autonomy to take decisions and act
 saral yaa jatil pratyaayojan : pratyaayojan ke vargeekaran main antim sthaan saral athwa jatil pratyaayojan kaa he
 Often, in small organizations, higher officials take the support of their subordinates to lighten the burden of their work and in the interest of seeking cooperation, they easily delegate power without any complication
 ye sanghathan itane chote or kam mahatv ke hote hai ki hastaantaran kii jatil prakriya ko apnaanaa uchit nahin samajhate
 On the other hand, complex processes are required in large organizations, where workplaces and jurisdictions are highly developed and complex
 isamen sasta kaa pratyaayojan yun hi aasaani se nahin ho jaataa balki pratyaayojan ko jatil nirdhaarit pratikriyaaon se hokar guzarana pasta he
 Classification of tarry: Tarry mentions three types of delegations: jab koi ucch adhikari apane adhinsth ko satta hastaantarit karata he to ise 'neeche kii ore kaa pratyaayojan' kaha jaataa he
 When a subordinate officer delegates power to his superior officer, it is called 'upward delegation', such as - the shareholder delegates power to his board of directors
 terry ke anusaar tirachha pratyaayojan vah he jo samaantar dhang se idhar–udhar jaataa hai
 Delegation in itself is neither permanent nor unlimited because when a person in power delegates power to his subordinates, he is not free from his fundamental responsibilities and accountability
 aamtaur par dekha jaataa he ki ucchadhikari utani hi satta kaa pratyaayojan karata he jitani satta kaa upyog adhinsth karmchaaree sugamawa purvak kar sake
 Delegation of unlimited power to any administrative organization leads to chaos and inefficiency
 he main ne is sandarbh main thik hi likhaa he ki samasya yah nahin he ki satta pratyyojit kii jaati he yaa nahin balki mahatvapurn to yah he ki satta kaa hastaantaran kis maatra main kiya jaataa he
 The following are the constraints and limitations faced by the delegation process: satta pratyaayojan par pramukh ankush desh ke samvidhan kaa hota he kyonki yadi samvidhan hi pratyaayojan par pratibandh lagaaye to satta pratyyojit hi nahin kii ja sakati he yaa satta kaa pratyaayojan usee seemaa tak hoga jis seemaa tak pratyaayojan kii anumati kanoon athwa samvidhan pradaan karata he
 Delegation of power is limited by parliamentary statutes
 kahaan par, kise, kitna, kis rup main satta kaa pratyaayojan kiya janaa he, iskaa nirdhaaran sansadeey vidhiyon dwaara simit kar diya jaataa he
 The delegation of power is done keeping in mind the competence and competence of the subordinate employees
 kyonki adhinsth karmchaariyon kii simit yogyata or kshamta swayan hi satta ke pratyaayojan ko simit kar detii he
 The size of the organization can also make the delegation of power more or less
 chote sanghathan main satta ke pratyaayojan ke liye adhiktam avasar uplabdh nahin hote hai
 The division of administrative organization into geographical areas has an impact on delegation of power, as the amount of delegation of power is reduced if the area of functioning of the organization is not geographically wide and spread
 satta ke pratyaayojan par sanchaar–sadhano kaa bhi asar padataa he
 Delegation opportunities are less if there is a lack of communication tools
 kuch adhikaron kii prakruti hi aisi he jinka pratyaayojan sambhav nahin ho paata he
 Some scholars believe that a manager cannot delegate his right to co-ordination because by doing so he would not want to make himself insignificant
 apatkaaleen paristhitiyon main bhi satta kaa pratyaayojan pratibandhit ho jaataa he
 At the time of solving the problems of crisis, high officials mostly discuss and use their intelligence in decision making
 sankatkalin paristhitiyon main satta ke pratyyojit hone kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 a major limitation on the delegation of power seems to be that no higher official wants to give authority to his subordinates to accept new policies and schemes
 satta ke pratyaayojan par ek anya prakaar kii seemaa yah laga di jaati he ki ucchadhikari apane adhinsthon ko niyam–nirmaan kaa adhikaar nahin soup sakate hai
 It is necessary to have certain conditions and principles for effective delegation

 The Hebrew tribes developed between these people and the Pantheon, so it is no surprise to assume that there was a shared heritage between them, the cult that is still slowly being subsumed, and which God is one of the authority of the scripture

 Later, God told Moses that his people had indulged themselves in sin, and they planned to destroy them and start new ones from Moses
 However, Moses argued that he should be released and God accepted his request
 And when the Lord heard the noise of the people shouting, he told Moses about it

 1 of the Kings According to King 12
 c26-30, Jeroboam oversees the religious rituals of the Israelites relative to the earrings
 26 yaarobaam ne man hi man vichaar kiya, "rajya ab sambhawatah daud ke paas aa jaayegaa
 27 ke ghar kii ore waapas ho jaaegi agar, in logon ne jerusalem main jaakar ishwar ke mandir baaliyaan arpit nahin karte, ve log punah aaropon ko unke swami yahuda ke raja rahubium ke hawaale kar denge
 ve mujhe maar daalenge or raja rahubium ke paas laut jaaenge
" 28 salaah lene ke baad raja ne do svarnim bachade banawaye
 usne logon se kaha, "jerusalem tak janaa tum logon ke vash kii baat nahin
 ye lo tumhaare ishvar, israel, jinhone tumhen misr se baahar laayaa

 30 And the same thing was sinned; people came to worship one in Bethel and the other in far-flung charity

 He uses the golden calf as an anti-vision method to ensure his safety and establish his identity as a king
 In addition, he erects two calf sculptures, in which he is depicted as a figment of cherubs made by King Solomon in Jerusalem

 Template: Bible verse ajra, israeliyon ke bich bolte hue, unke itihaas kii yaad dilaataa he or unase ishwar kii krupa ke bare main bataata he jis darmiyaan ve bachade se ishwar kii puja karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 The language of Ezra in reference to "god" indicates that there are some discrepancies between the other cases of Israelites and their use of the calf
 nirgaman ke vivaran ke anusaar evam yahuda ke dakshin rajya main sthit vidhi-vivaran vetta itihaaskaaron dwaara likhit kings 1 sanskaran main, israeliyon ke vishwasghaat kaa pardaafash karne kii pravriti rahi he
 This inconsistency is found mainly in Exodus 32
4, in which "gods" are represented as plurals, despite the fact that a single calf was formed
 jab ajra kahani ko doharaata he, vah keval ekal, bade aksharon main likhe jane vaale ishwar kaa ullekh karata he
 Despite a seemingly simplistic excuse, the story of the gold calf is complex
 maaikel kugan ke anusaar aisa lagata he ki sone kaa bachhda kisi duusare ishwar kii murti nahin tha or is prakaar yah ayatharth athwa mithyaa ishwar tha
 They cite Exodus 32: 4-5: He takes gold from them, melts it and builds the calf statue; And they said, "these are your gods, o people of Israel, this is what brought you out of the land of Egypt
" " jab haaron ne ise dekha, usne iske saamne ek vedi bana di; or haaron ne yah ghoshnaa kar di, "aagaamee kal ishwar ke naam par utsav yojit hoga
" mahatvapurn baat yah he ki, is katha-vrittant main keval ek hi bachhda he, jabaki log "devataaon" ke pratinidhitiv ke sandarbh main iskaa ullekh karte he
 While the mention of a single God does not necessarily refer to the worship of Jehovah itself, it does not rule out the possibility that it is Jehovah whom the people are worshiping, as referred to by the plural of "gods"
 Also in verse 5, the celebration of "the name of God" is sometimes translated "towards Jehovah"
 is baat par bhi gaur karnaa chahie ki "das ishwar-adeshon kii katha ke kalkram main" logon ko gadhi gai murtiyon ki sristi ke viruddh koi ishwar-aadesh bhi nahin diya gaya tha jab unalogon ne bachhda banane main unki madad karne ke aise vyahavhaar ko tab tak spasht rup se gaiyr-kanoonee qaraar nahin kiya gaya tha
 The second thing that is understood from the description of the gold calf is that the calf was accepted as the platform of the Lord
 nikat purv kii kala main, devataaon ko ko aksar kisi na kisi singhaasana par asin
 is vivaran ke adhyayan se tab yah tark sangat rup main maan liya ja saktaa he ki strot kaa bachhda pratigyaptr kii manjusha athwa devdoot kaa vikalp maatr tha jisapar yahova singhasanacin tha
 The reason for this complication can be understood as 1) the criticism of Aaron as the priesthood house that competed with Moses' priest-dwelling, and / or 2
) "the invasion of the northern kingdom of Israel
 In form of
" The second interpretation is based on the "sins of Jeroboam", the collapse of the northern kingdom by Assyria in 722 BC
 Jeroboam's "sin" was to look for two gold calves and send one of them to the south of the kingdom to be worshiped at Bethel and the other to be worshiped in charity on the northern side of the kingdom, so that the northern The people of the state do not continue to go to Jerusalem to worship
 According to Coogan, this episode is only a part of the history of the details of the law, which was written after the fall of the northern state, which was against the bias of the northern state
 kugan kaa kahana he ki yaarobaam jerusalem ke mandir ko karubon ke vikalp ke rup main keval pesh kiye jane ke liye tha or isiilie bachade gaiyr-yahovi puja kii ore sanket nahin karte
 Documentary inference can be used to further understand the anecdote of this description; The idea is that the early story of the gold calf is preserved by e and originated in the northern kingdom
 uttari rajya ke patan ke pashchaat jab e or j ek saamaan judate hai, "uttari rajya ko nakaaratmak alok main pradarshit karne ke uddeshy se katha kaa punah praaroop pradaan kiya gaya" or bachade kii puja ko "bahudevvaad" ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya, jisamen "younachaar ke saath nange naach kaa bhi suzav tha 
 katha vivaranon ko ekatrit kiya jaataa he, ho saktaa he p ne is maamle main haaron ke aparaadh ko kam kar diya ho, lekin bachade ke saath judi nakaaratmak ko barkaraar sangrakshit rakhaa gaya
 The incident of Israel and the golden calf are mentioned again in the Quran in Taha 20
83
 is prakaran kaa korani sanskaran adhikansh sandarbhon main mul ke hi samaan he, sivaay iske ki sone ke bachade haaron ne nahin balki samiri naam ke ek vyakti ne banaaya
 samiri kaa daawa he ki musa antardhan ho gaye or israeliyon ko ek nae ishwar kii talash thi
 The story ends in this way, Samiri creates a gold calf with gold ornaments brought to Egypt
 haaron, jo musa kii anupasthiti main netaa kii bhoomika nibhaataa he, logon ko murti kii puja karne se rokane kii koshish karata he, kintu asafal rahata he
 When Moses returns, he is furious at the ritual of paganism and Aaron's inability to stop it, and pulls his bearded Aaron's beard out loud in one stroke
 musa samiri ko deshnikala kii sazaa dete hai tathaa sone ke bachade ko jalaakar evam isaki raakh ko samudra main baha dene kaa aadesh dete hai
 Emancipation by making and worshiping the gold calf can be seen in the verses of Sura Taha of the Quran: "isse pehle hi haaron ne unase kaha tha: "i mere logon tumhaara imtihaan isi main he: vastav main tumhaare maalik hai sabase zyada dayaalu ; isliye mere anugami bano or mere adeshon kaa anupaalan karo" unhone kaha: "ham is panth kaa tyaag nahin karenge, lekin ham tab tak khud ko iske liye samarpit kar denge jabatak ki musa waapas nahin aate
" ne kaha: "he haaron! kis baat ne tumhen peeche kar diya? jabaki tumne dekha ki ve galat raah par ja rahe the
 Did you disobey my order then? "replied:" o my mother's son! Do not hold it with my beard, nor with my head! Truly i was afraid that you might not say that "you have created a division among the children of Israel and you do not honor my word
" " " In the song Bob Dylan, Gates of Eden, Aladdin and His Lamps Zanana sit on the ground with fictional monk monks on a golden calf
