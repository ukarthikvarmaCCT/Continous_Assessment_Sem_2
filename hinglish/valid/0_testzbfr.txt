 These martyrs and their other comrades started 'gadar' on 19 February 1915 against British colonialism that had occupied India

 The 'gadar' movement was not a peaceful movement, it was an armed rebellion, but the 'gadar Party' declared it openly by not giving it in secret and the Gadar Party's letter 'gadar', which was in four languages punjabi, Hindi, Urdu and Gujarati It used to come through - it had given a call to the entire Indian public

 Just as the story of 1857 'gadar' i
e
 the first freedom struggle is very exciting, similarly the second armed struggle for freedom ie 'gadar' may also have failed but its story is no less interesting

 Like 1857, the 'ghadar' movement was a truly secular struggle involving people from all religions and communities
 gadar party andolan kii yah visheshta bhi rekhaankit karne laayak he ki vidroh kii asafalataa se gadar party samaapt nahin hui, balki isane apana antarrashtriya astitv bachaae rakhaa va bharat main communist party main shaamil hokar va videshon main alag astitv banaae rakhkar gadar party ne bharat ke swadhinata sangram main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya
 Later on, the youth rebellion of Punjab from 1925-26, whose popular hero became Bhagat Singh, was also strongly influenced by the Gadar Party and Kartar Singh Sarabha
 ek tarah se bhagat singh kaa vyaktitv va chintan gadar party kii parampara ko apanaate hue uske agragami vikaas ke rup main nikharaa
 Kartar Singh Sarabha became the hero of the Gadar Party in the same way as Bhagat Singh later became the great hero of the revolutionary movement during 1925 - 31
 yah aswabhaavik nahin he ki kartaar singh sarabha hi bhagat singh ke sabase lokapriy nayak the, jinka chitra ve hameshaa apni jeb main rakhte the or ‘noujvaan bharat sabha’ naamak yuva sanghathan ke madhyam se ve kartaar singh sarabha ke jivan ko slide sho dwaara punjab ke navayuvakon main azaadi kii prerana jagaane ke liye dikhaate the
 In every public meeting of 'naujawan Bharat Sabha', a portrait of Kartar Singh Sarabha was placed on the platform and a wreath was given to it
 kartaar singh sarabha, gadar party andolan ke lok nayak ke rup main apane bahut chote-se raajnneetik jivan ke kaaryakalapon ke kaaran ubhare
 Within two-three years Sarabha left such bright rays of his brilliant personality that he brightened the soul of the youth of the country in the color of patriotism
 aise vir nayak ko faansee dene se nyaayadhish bhi bachanaa chaahate the or sarabha ko unhone adaalat main diya bayaan halkaa karne kaa mashvira or vakt bhi diya, lekin desh ke navayuvakon ke liye preranastrot banane vaale is vir nayak ne bayaan halkaa karne kii bajaay or sakht kiya or faansee kii sazaa paakar khushi main apana vazan badhaate hue hansate-hansate faansee par jhul gaya
 This ghazal of Kartar Singh Sarabha was very dear to Bhagat Singh, he always kept it with him and often chanted in private: aparaadh, apradhi, aapraadhik swabhaav tathaa aparaadhiyon ke sudhaar kaa vaigyanik adhyayan aparaadh shaastra ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 Under this, the attitude of society towards crime, causes of crime, consequences of crime, types of crime and prevention of crime are also studied
 samaaj jisamen vyakti rahata he, maanviya samaaj kehalaata he
 Humanitarian rules and laws in human society are made for different society to run the society
 bane hue saamaajik niyamon ko todne ko aparaadh kii shrenee main gina jaataa he
 The rules of economic, political, religious and human living in social rules are formulated according to different times and civilizations
 aparaadh jis samay maanav samaaj kii rachana hui arthath manushya ne apana samaajik sanghathan prarambh kiya, usee samay se usne apane sanghathan kii raksha ke liye naitik, saamaajik aadesh banaae
 Following the orders, the 'religion' of man was revealed
 kintu, jis samay se maanav samaaj bana he, usee samay se uske adeshon ke viruddh kaam karanevaal bhi paidaa ho gaye he or jab tak manushya pravriti hi na badal jaae, aise vyakti baraabar hote rahenge
 There has been an attempt to explain crime since ages
 atev ke
 sen ne aparaadh kii sata itihaas kaal ke bhi purv se maani he
 It is therefore difficult to explain
 purvi tathaa pashchimi deshon ke praarambhik vidhaanon ke naitik, dharmik tathaa saamaajik niyamon kaa todna samaan rup se aparaadh tha
 Sargent Santiphan has written that it is a crime to act contrary to what the majority of the community thinks is right
 bladeston kehete hai ki samue samudaay ke prati kartavya he tathaa uske jo adhikaar hai unki avagya aparaadh kaa nirnay nagar kii samoochee janata karti thi
 In today's law, crime is considered the object of 'public harm'
 do sau varsh purv tak sansar ke sabhi deshon kii yah nishcitt niti thi ki jisane samaaj ke adeshon kii avagya kii he, usase badla lenaa chahie
 That is why the criminal was tortured a lot
 jelon main uske saath pashu se bhi bura vyavhaar hota tha
 This feeling has changed now
 aaj samaaj kii nishchit dharna he ki aparaadh, shaareerik tathaa maansik donon prakaar kaa rog he, isliye apradhi kii chikitsa kerani chahie
 It has to be returned by making a decent, civilized, moral citizen while returning to society
 atev karagaar yatnaa ke liye nahin, sudhaar ke liye he
 It became clear that if crime is the name of defiance of moral and social orders, then the word cannot be given any definite meaning
 frid varg ke viddhan prayek aparaadh ko kamvasana kaa parinaam batalaate he tathaa hili jaise shastri use saamaajik vaataavaran kaa parinaam kehete hai, kintu ye donon mat maanya nahin he
 There is not a single type of religion in a country
 har ek main ek hi prakaar kaa saamaajik sanghathan bhi nahin he, rahan sahan main bhed he, aachaar vichaar main bhed he, aisi sthiti main ek desh kaa aparaadh duusare desh main sarvatha uchit aachaar ban saktaa he
 Somewhere it is a valid thing to divorce a woman, elsewhere it is completely forbidden
 kahin par sanyukt parivaar ke jivan uchit he, kahin par paariwaaki jivan kaa koi kanoonee niyam nahin he
 In 1946–47, those who committed thieves in England were severely punished, in France it was considered an 'ordinary' thing
 kai desh dharmik rup se kiya gaya vivaah hi vaid maanate he
 In Eastern Europe and many other literary countries, marriages done by religious practice have no legal significance
 sanyukt rashtrasang ne bhi aparaagh kii vyakhya karne kii cheshtaa kii he or usne bhi keval 'asaamaajik' athwa 'samajavirohi' kaaryon ko aparaadh sweekaar kiya he
 But this cannot create a worldwide moral and crime related legislation
 mote taur par sach bolnaa, chori na karnaa, duusare ke dhan yaa jivan kaa apharan na karnaa, pita, mata tathaa gurujanon kaa aadar, kamvasana par niyantran, yahi moulik naitikta he jiskaa har samaaj main paalan hota he or jiske vipareet kaam karnaa aparaadh he
 Dr
 Lambrozo of Italy was the first scribe who tried to identify the 'criminal' rather than the crime
 pheri samaajavigyaan dwaara aparaadh ho, chaahe koi bhi kare, kisi bhi paristhiti main kare, uskaa or koi kaaran nahin, keval yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki vyaktigat swatantra ichha se kiya gaya he yaa prakritik yaa swaabhaavik kaarnon kaa parinnam he
 Garofalo considered crime a matter of psychology: according to him, there are four types of criminals - murderers, violent criminals, criminals against property, and criminals of lust
 garophalo ke mat se prandand, aajanm karagaar yaa deshnikala, ye hi teen sajaayen honi chahie
 Fon Haamel raised the discussion of criminal reform for the first time
 france ke pandit tarmde ne naitik jimmedaari, 'vyaktigat vishistataa' kii charchaa kii
 According to him, man is just a set of his consciousness and conscience
 uske kaaryon se jise dukh pahunche yani jiske prati aparaadh kiya jaay usko bhi samaan rup se saamaajik ekta ke prati sachet karnaa chahie
 France's state revolution declared 'human rights'
 apradhi bhi manushya hai
 He too has some natural rights
 isliye apradhi aparaadh kii vyakhya chaahate he
 The most obvious interpretation of this was given by the French Penal Code of 1934
 aparaadh vahi he jise kanuunan manaa kiya gaya ho
 The thing which is denied in the then environment is the crime
 kintu, kanuunan nazaij kaam karnaa hi aparaadh nahin rah gaya he
 The point which Dr
 Gutner had raised has become a great subject for every court today
 vahi aparaagh he
 If while flying a kite on the roof, a stone comes down on the road from a boy's foot and falls on the head of another person, then that boy is not guilty of murder
 atev mahatv kii vastu niyat he
 Real justice can only be done by mixing the crime and its intention to commit it
 kintu samajashaastra ke panditonke saamne yah samasya bhi thi or he ki samaaj kii haani karanevaal ke saath vyavhaar kaisaa ho
 Aflatoon was of the opinion that it is unfair to harm the harm
 prasiddh samaaj-shastri jivik ne spasht kaha tha ki nyaay kabhi nahin chahta ki bhul karanevaal yani aparaadh karanwane ko pidaa pahunchaai jaae
 Lord Haldane also advised not to consider crime, but to consider the criminal, his problems, his environment
 britain ke prasiddh raajnneetijna tathaa kai baar praghan mantri bananevaale winston churchill kaa kathan he ki aparaadh tathaa apradhi ke prati janata kii kisi bhaavana tathaa drushti he, usee se us desh kii sabhyataa kaa vaastavik anumaan lag saktaa he
 British law considers the same act to be a crime that is done ill-favorably, voluntarily, cunningly, done, allowed or allowed
 bahut se aparaadh aise hote hai jo aparaadh hone ke karan hi aparaadh nahin samajhe jate
 For example, gene type marriages are illegal in the UK, so even if married, it would not be considered a marriage, such as marrying a girl under 16, etc
 naveen audyogic sabhyataa main aparaadh kaa rup tathaa prakaar bhi badal gaya he
 New types of crimes have started happening which are difficult to imagine
 isliye aparaadh kii pahchaan ab is samay yahi he ki kanoon ne jis kaam ko manaa kiya he, vah aparaadh he
 The one who has done the forbidden work is the culprit
 kintu, apradhi paristhiti kaa das ho saktaa he, vivash ho saktaa he, isliye use pahchaanane kaa praytn karnaa hoga
 Today's criminology does not believe that someone has become a worshiper by learning from the stomach or someone is deliberately making it his 'life'
 har ek aparaadh kaa tathaa har ek apradhi kaa adhyayan hona chahie
 That is why every crime and every criminal has become the subject of personal study, personal diagnosis and personal medicine
 manovigyaan aparaadh ko manushya kii maansik ulajhanon kaa parinaam maanata he
 a person whose childhood does not pass in an atmosphere of love and encouragement, many types of mental glands of inferiority are formed in his mind
 in grathiyon main uski man main uski bahut si maansik shakti sanchit rahati he
 Dr
 Alfred Adler states that a person who has mental glands of inferiority in his mind inevitably commits many kinds of crimes
 yah aparaadh vah isliye karata he ki swayan ko vah duusare logon se adhik balavaan siddh kar sake
 The gland of inferiority remains in the mind in this person, he is always in a state of inner mental dissatisfaction
 vah sab samay aise kaamon main apane ko lagaae rahata he jisase sabhi log uski ore dekhen or uski prashansa kare
 The mental gland of inferiority puts man in such works, due to which the human being has to hear many kinds of condemnation
 es vyakti swayan ko sadaa charchaa kaa vishay banaae rakhana chahta he
 If it is not discussed for good works then it should be for bad works
 uski maansik granthi use shant man nahin rahane detii
 She always inspires him to do special work
 yadi aise vyakti ko dand kiya jaae to isse uskaa sudhaar nahin hota, apitu isse uski maansik granthi or bhi jatil ho jaati he
 The treatment of such a criminal requires a mental doctor
 aadhunik manovigyaan ne hamen bataaya he ki samaaj main aparaadh ko kam karne ke liye dandvidhaan ko kadaa karnaa paryaapt nahin he
 For this education is required in the society
 jab manushya kii koi pravriti bachapan se hi prabal ho jaati he to aage chalkaar vah vishesh prakaar ke kaaryo main prakashit hoti he
 These works are beneficial for the society or are anti-social
 samajavirohi kaary hi hamen vyakti ke prati uchit drushtikon rakhana hoga
 The child who is kept dearly and is allowed to do all kinds of things, does not have the ability to relinquish his happiness for the happiness of others
 es vyakti kii saamaajik bhavanaayen aviksit rah jaati he
 Life does not create goodness
 iske kaaran vah na to samaajik drushti se bhale bure kaa vichaar kar saktaa he ore na bure kaamon se swayan ko rokane kii kshamta praapt kar paata he
 The parents of the child and the surrounding air conditioners and schools work in it
 uchit shiksha kaa ek uddeshy yahi he ki balak apane upar sanyam kii kshamta aa jaae
 The higher the state of self-control, the less the crime
 samaaj main bahut se log apane vivek se pratikul aparaadh karte hai
 What is the reason for this? According to the discoveries of modern psychology, the childhood of such people would not have passed properly
 ye log buddhi main to janm se hi praveen the atev ye anek prakaar ke vichaaron ko jaan sake
 But they did not have such permanent feelings in their mind in their childhood so that they can stop themselves from doing inappropriate work
 ye sthaayee bhav jab tak manushya ke swabhaav ke ang nahin ban jate tab tak ve manushya ko duraachaar se rokane kii kshamta nahin dete
 Such scholars commit crimes and even curse themselves for them
 isse ve apni maansik ulajhanein badha lete hai
 Sometimes they use their scholarship to prove the morality of their unfair actions
 inkaa sudhaar saamaanya dandvidhaan se nahin ho paata
 They devise many ways to avoid them
 aise logon ko sudhaarney ke liye aavashyak he ki shiksha kaa dhyey aajeevika kamanaa athwa vyavahaarakushalata praapt kar lenaa na hokar maanav vyaktitv kaa sampurna vikaas arthath bauddhik or bhavatmak vikaas ho
 When a person starts to see his own interest in the interest of others and gets the ability to conduct according to this idea, then only he is a qualified citizen of the society
 aisa vyakti jab kuch karata he, vah samaaj ke hit ke liye hi hota he
 Crime is a type of social asymmetry
 yah vyaktigat maansik vishmata kaa parinaam he
 This type of asymmetry starts in childhood
 iske sudhaar ke liye prarambh main aadat daalani padati he ki vah dusron ke sukh main nij sukh kaa anubhav kare
 He should do such things which will benefit everyone and praise him
 hindu dharamshastron ke anusaar saamanyatya chalit dharamshastra ke niyam, saamaajik niyam or rajanium ke viruddh aacharan karnaa hi aparaadh hai
 The field of Hindu theology is very broad, under which the idea of violation of all kinds of rules, economic, political, social etc
 is available
 isi ke anusaar hindu dharamshastron main saamaanya rup se 32 prakaar ke aparaadh bataae gaye hai
 The number of them can also be more because the nature of these crimes also varies according to the variation of country, time and society
 isliye bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke vichaar vyakt karte dikhaai padate hai
 Hindu theology or memoir appears to express different views regarding crimes and their punishments
 hindu dharamshastra ke antargat aparaadh ke swaroop par vichaar karne ke liye manu, yajyavlky, parashar, naarad, brihaspati, katyayan aadi ko pramaan mana jaataa hai
 In considering the crime from a mental point of view, Lambrozo had said long ago that the body of a criminal has a special shape
 parantu us samay unke mat ko manyata nahin mili
 Recently some experiments were conducted on criminals which concluded that 60 percent of the criminals have abnormal body designs

 In 1968, an argument was made in a court of Celadan against a man, the murderer of his four children, that my chromosome is super-primitive, that is, the sequence of chromosomes in my blood cells is 'XY', which caused my crime psychosis
 It is natural and i have murdered my children to abdicate responsibility in an abnormal mental state

 Sankhan Ghosh from Indian Express praised Singh's tone as "believable"

 The taun or plague is among the oldest pandemics in the world

 It is said that after this, a large fire in London drove out the plague from the city

 During World War II, in 1942, an armed force called the Azad Hind Fauj or Indian National Army was formed to free India from British occupation

 In the beginning, Indian soldiers who were made prisoners of war were taken in this army
 baad main isamen burma or malaya main sthit bhartiya swayamsevak bhi bhartee kiye gayi
 a year later, in June 1943, Subhash Chandra Bose announced from Tokyo radio that it was absolutely futile to expect the British to leave their own empire
 hamen bharat ke bheetar va baahar se swatantraaa ke liye swayan sangharsh karnaa hoga
 In a fit of rage, Rasbihari Bose handed over the leadership to 46-year-old Subhash on 4 July 1943

 The story of the eighteenth effigy Taramati is as follows - King Vikramaditya had no answer to the virtues
 ve vidwaanon tathaa kalakaaron ko bahut sammaan dete the
 More than one scholar and artist was present in his court, yet qualified persons from other states also came and received respect and reward from him according to their merit
 ek din vikram ke darbar main dakshin bharat ke kisi rajya se ek vidwaan aashay tha ki vishwasghaat vishwa kaa sabase neech karm he
 He narrated a story to the king to clarify his idea
 usne kaha- aryaav main bahut samay pehle ek raja tha
 He had a full family, yet at the age of seventy he married a rupati girl
 vah nai rani ke rup par itnaa mohit ho gaya ki usase ek pal bhi alag hone kaa uskaa man nahin karata tha
 He wanted everyone's face to be in front of him
 vah nai rani ko darbar main bhi apane bagal main bithaane laga
 No one dares to speak in front of him, but behind his back everyone would ridicule him
 raja ke mahamantri ko yah baat buree lagi
 He privately told the king that everyone criticized him
 agar vah har pal nai rani kaa cheharaa dekhtaa rahanaa chahta he to uski acchhee-si tasviir banavaakar rajsinghaasana ke saamne rakhwa de
 Since the king has a tradition of sitting alone in this state, it is indecent to bring his queen with him to the court
 mahamantri raja kaa yuvakal se hi mitra jaisaa tha or raja uski har baat ko gambhirthapurvak letaa tha
 He asked the general minister to hand over the work of making a picture of a little queen to a good painter
 mahamantri ne ek bade hi yogya chitrakaar ko bulaayaa
 The artist began painting of Queen
 jab chitra banakar rajdurbar aayaa, to har koi chitrakaar kaa prashansak ho gaya
 The painter had also removed the fine thing in that picture
 chitra aisa jeevant tha maano choti rani kisi bhi kshan bol padegi
 The king also liked the picture
 tabhi uski nazar chitrakaar dwaara banaai gai rani kii jangha par gai, jis par chitrakaar ne badi safaai se ek til dikhaa diya tha
 The king suspected that the painter had also seen the queen's secret parts and in anger, she asked the painter to tell the truth
 chitrakaar ne puri shaleenta se use vishwaas dilaane kii koshish kii ki prakruti ne use sookshm drushti di he jisase use chhipi hui baat bhi pataa chal jaati he
 The mole is a proof of that and he has tried to show the mole to enhance its beauty
 raja ko uski baat kaa zaraa bhi vishwaas nahin hua
 He summoned the executioners and immediately ordered him to go into the thick forest and blow his neck and asked him to take out his eyes and present him in the court
 mahamantri ko pataa tha ki chitrakaar kii baaten sach hai
 On the way, he freed the painter by tempting those executioners and asked them to kill a deer and take out his eyes so that the king would believe that the artist had been killed
 chitrakaar ko lekar mahamantri apane bhawan le aayaa tathaa chitrakaar vesh badalakar usee ke saath rahane laga
 a few days later the king's son went hunting, then a lion followed him
 rajkumaar jaan bachaane ke liye ek ped par chadh gaya
 Just then, he saw a bear already on the tree
 bhaaluu se jab vah bhaybheet hua to bhaaluu ne usase nishcint rahane ko kaha
 The bear said that he, like him, is afraid of the lion and has climbed the tree and is waiting for the lion to leave
 sher bhookha tha or un donon par aankh jamaakar us ped ke neeche baitha tha
 Rajkumar started to sit and sleep and found it difficult to stay awake
 bhaaluu ne apni ore use bula diya ek ghani shakha par kuch der so lene ko kaha
 The bear said that when he woke up he would wake up and guard and the bear would sleep
 When the prince fell asleep, the lion tried to lure the bear
 usne kaha ki vah or bhaaluu vanya praani hai, isliye donon ko ek duusare kaa bhala sochna chahie
 Man can never be a friend of wildlife
 usne bhaaluu se rajkumaar ko gira dene ko kaha jisase ki vah use apana grass bana sake
 But the bear did not listen to him and said that he could not betray
 sher man masoskar rah gaya
 When the prince awakened after completing four hours of sleep, the bear's turn came and he fell asleep
 sher ne ab rajkumaar ko phuslane kii koshish kii
 He said why he is suffering for the bear
 vah agar bhaaluu ko gira detaa ho to sher kii bhukh mit jaaegi or vah aaraam se rajmahal laut jayega
 Prince came in the influence of her
 usne dhakka dekar bhaaluu ko giraane kii koshish kii
 But the bear did not know how and woke up and called the prince treacherous
 rajkumaar kii intaraatma ne use itnaa kosa ki vah goonga ho gaya
 When the lion left in search of other prey in the jungle, he reached the palace
 kisi ko bhi uske goonga hone kii baat samaj main nahin ai
 Many great physicians came, but no one understood the prince's disease
 aakhirkaar mahamantri ke ghar chipa hua vah kalakaar vaidya kaa rup dharkar rajkumaar ke paas aayaa
 He got to know everything by reading the facial expressions of the dumb prince
 usne rajkumaar ko sanket kii bhashaa main puch ki kya aatmaglani se peedit hokar vah apni vaani kho chukaa he, to rajkumaar foot-foot kar ro padaa
 The crying had a psychological effect on her and her lost voice returned
 raja ko bada aashcharya hua ki usne rajkumaar ke chehre ko dekhakar sachai kaise jaan lee to chitrakaar ne jawaab diya ki jis tarah kalakaar ne unki rani kii jaangh kaa til dekh liya tha
 The king immediately understood that he was the artist he had ordered to be killed
 vah chitrakaar se apni bhul kii maafee maangane laga tathaa dher saare inaam dekar use sammanit kiya
 Vikramaditya was very pleased with the story of the scholar of that south and, honoring his erudition, he gave him one lakh gold currencies

 mohammad sahab ko apane natiyon se bahut pyaar tha paigambar ke is prasiddh kathan kaa shiya va sunni dono sampradaayon ke vidwano ne ullekh kiya he
 The Prophet said that "hussein belongs to me and i am from Hussein
 allaah tu usase prem kar jo hossain se prem kare
 " muavia ne ali a0 se khilaafat ke liye ladaai ladi thi
 After Ali, his eldest son Hasan was to become Khalifa
 muavia ko ye baat pasand nahin thi
 He wanted the throne of Khilafat fighting Hassan Alaihisslam
 hasan alehisslam ne is shart par ki wo muavia kii adheenta sweekaar nahin karenge, muavia ko hukumat de di
 But even then Mu'awiya was not happy and eventually he killed and killed Hassan Alaihisslam

 When sixty-one Hijri died in Mu'awiya, and his son Yazid asked Hazrat Imam Hussein Alaihissalam to bathe after sitting on the throne, you refused to do so
 or islamki raksha hetu veerta purvak ladate hue shahid ho gayi
 According to the treaty with Mu'awiya, after Mu'awiya's death, Hassan Alaihissalam would again be succeeded by his younger brother Hussein Alaheisslam Khalifa, but Mu'awiya did not like it either
 usne hossain alehisslam ko khilaafat dene se manaa kar diya
 Mu'awiya died the last 6 months before its ten-year term
 shart ke mutabik muavia kii koi santan khilaafat kii hakdaar nahin hogi, fir bhi usne apane bete ko yazid pratham khaliph bana diya or imam hossain alehisslam se beyat maagane laga jis par hossain alehisslam ne kaha "mere jesa tujh jese ki beyat kabhi nahi kar saktaa"

 He led the Indian soldiers in the first Indian freedom struggle of 1857
 yuddh main haar ke baad angrejon ne unhen burma bhej diya jahaan unki mrityu hui
 Zafar was born on October 24, 1775
 unke pita akbar shah dwitiya or maa lalbai thim
 After the death of his father, Zafar was made Mughal emperor on 18 September 1837
 yah digar baat thi ki us samay tak dilli kii sultanate behad kamjor ho gai thi or mughal badshaah nammaatr kaa samraat rah gaya tha
 Zafar had to pay a heavy price for playing an important role in India's first freedom struggle
 unke putron or prapautron ko british adhikariyon ne saream goliyon se bhun daalaa
 Moreover, he was taken captive to Rangoon, where he died as a prisoner on November 7, 1862
 unhen rangoon main shwadagon pagoda ke najadik dafnaaya gaya
 His burial site is now known as Bahadur Shah Zafar Dargah
 aaj bhi koi deshpremi vyakti jab tatkaaleen burma kii yatra karata he to vah jafar kii majaar par jaakar unhen shradhanjali dena nahin bhuulataa
 How much respect people had for him can be gauged from the fact that in many places in India, roads have been named after him, while in Lahore city of Pakistan, a road was named after him
 is
 bangladesh ke old dhaka shahar sthit victoria park kaa naam badalakar bahadur shah jafar park kar diya gaya he
 In 1857, when the spark of India's independence erupted, all the rebel soldiers and kings and emperors considered him Emperor of India and led them to brick by brick of the British
 angrejon ke khilaaf bhartiya sainikon kii baghawat ko dekh bahadur shah jafar kaa bhi gussa foot padaa or unhone angrejon ko hindustan se khadedane kaa aahvaan kar daalaa
 Indians defeated the British hard in Delhi and other parts of the country
 shuruaati parinaam hindustani yoddhaon ke paksh main rahe, lekin baad main angrejon ke chal-kapat ke chalate pratham swadhinata sangram kaa rukh badal gaya or angrej baghawat ko dabaane main kaamyaab ho gaye
 Bahadur Shah Zafar took refuge in Humayun's tomb, but Major Hadas captured him along with his son Mirza Mughal and Khizar Sultan and grandson Abu Bakr
 angrejon ne julm kii sabhi hadein paar kar deen
 When Bahadur Shah Zafar was hungry, the British served him in front of the plate and brought his sons heads
 unhone angrejon ko jawaab diya ki hindustan ke bete desh ke liye sir qurbaan kar apane baap ke paas isi andaaj main aayaa karte hai
 The British sent the last Mughal emperor out of the country to Rangoon to eliminate the rebellion for independence
 bahadur shah jafar sirf ek deshbhakt mughal badshaah hi nahin balki urdu ke mashhoor kavi bhi the
 He wrote a number of famous Urdu poems, many of which were lost or destroyed during the upheaval that broke out against the British
 unke dwaara urdu main likhi gai panktiyaan bhi kaaphi mashhoor hai- xxrep 4 , Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
,,, His Urdu poems continued to flourish in Rangoon outside the country
 vahaan unhen har vakt hindustan kii phikr rahi
 His last wish was that he take the last breath of his life in India and be buried there, but that could not happen
 lagata nahin he ji meraa ujde dayaar main,kis kii bani he alam-e-napaayadaar main
 Bulbul was written from Bagban and not Sayyid, destined to be imprisoned in fasal-e-bahar

 The day was over in the evening, the legs of the spreaders would sleep in kunj-e-mazar
 kitna he badanaseeb 'zafer' dafn ke liye,do gaz zamin bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 There are very few rulers like Bahadur Shah Zafar who love their country like Mehbooba and succumb to pardes with the promise of not getting a place in ku-i-yaar
 yahi buniyadi farq tha moolbhoot hindustani vichaardhaara ke saath jo apane desh ko apni maan maanate he
 When King Zafar breathed his last while imprisoned in Rangoon, this lion of his own famous ghazal must have been on his lips- "how much is bad luck for Zafar Dawn, two yards of land was not even found in ku-i-yaar 
 " Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor to play an important role in India's first freedom struggle, is also noted as a great poet of Urdu
 unki shaayari bhavuk kavi kii bajaay deshbhakti ke josh se bhari rahati thi or yahi kaaran tha ki unhone angrej shaskaon ko takhte-landan tak hindustan kii shamsheer chalane kii chetavanee di thi
 According to public opinion, when the emperor Zafar was arrested after the first freedom struggle, an English military officer who knew Urdu said this lion while sarcastically saying - "dum dum nahi, now Khair mango ki a jafar is now sheath Is Shamsheer of India 

 !! " On this, Zafar gave a befitting reply and said - "there will be boo in Hindi when the talk of Iman, the planks will go till London
 bharat main mughalkaal ke antim badshaah kahe jane vaale jafar ko pratham swatantraaa sangram ke dauraan dilli kaa badshaah banaaya gaya tha
 One of the few orders he gave as soon as he became emperor was to ban cow slaughter
 is aadesh se pataa chalata he ki ve hindu-muslim ekta ke kitne bade pakshdhar the
 According to Dr
 Shailnath Chaturvedi, former Professor of History at Gorakhpur University, during the time of 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar was such a great personality, who was respected not only as a king but also as a secular person
 isiilie behad swaabhaavik tha ki meerut se vidroh kar jo sainik dilli pahunche unhone sabase pehle bahadur shah jafar ko apana badshaah banaaya
 Chaturvedi said in conversation that making Zafar the emperor was a message to the British rulers symbolically
 iske tahat bhartiya sainik yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki bharat ke kendra dilli main videshi nahin balki bhartiya shaasha kii satta chalegi
 Bahadur Shah Zafar's order to ban cow slaughter after becoming a king was not a new order
 balki akbar ne apane shasankaal main isi tarah kaa aadesh de rakhaa tha
 Zafar had merely started following this order again
 deshprem ke saath-saath jafar ke vyaktitv kaa ek anya pahalu shaayari thi
 Not only did he encourage large Urdu poets like Ghalib, Daag, Momin and Jauk, but he himself was a good poet
 saahitiyik samikshakon ke anusaar jafar ke samay main jahaan mughalakalin satta charmara rahi thi vahiin urdu sahitya khaskar urdu shaayari apni bulandiyon par thi
 After Zafar's death, his poetry was compiled under the name "kulliyat e Zafar"

 Dr
 Annie Besant believed that it is not possible to solve all these difficulties without political freedom
 dow ani bessent swabhaavat: dharmik pravriti kii mahila thim
 The foundation of his political thought was his spiritual and moral values
 unka vichaar tha ki achchhai ke maarg kaa nirdhaaran bina aadhyatm ke sambhav nahin
 To achieve a welfare life, human desires should be subject to divine will
 raashtra kaa nirmaan evam vikaas tabhi sambhav he jab us desh ke vibhinn dharmon, manyataon evam samskritiyon main ekta sthapit ho
 Knowledge of true religion is attained only by spiritual consciousness
 unke in vichaaron ko mahatma gandhi ne bhi sweekaar kiya
 The nature of civilization and culture of ancient India was spiritual
 yahi aadhyatmikta us samay ke bharatiyon kii nidhi thi
 The aim of Dr
 Besant was to remove the distortions in Hindu society and its spirituality

 She was convinced that she was a Hindu in a previous life
 vah dharm or vigyaan main koi bhed nahin maanati thim
 He had full faith in religious tolerance
 unhone bhartiya dharm kaa gambheer adhyayan kiya
 His translation of the Bhagavad Gita 'that's on the study of the Bhagavad Gita' is a proof that he had deep faith in Hindu religion and philosophy
 ve kaha karti thim ki hindu dharm main itane sampradaayon kaa hona is baat kaa pramaan he ki isamen swatantra bauddhik vikaas ko protsaahan diya jaataa he
 She believed that India only had the ability to guide the world
 ve bharat ke sadiyon se andh vishwaason se grast maanav ko mukt karnaa chaahati thim
 Dr
 Besant saw the ideal of service to the poor in socialism
 garibi dur karne ke liye unka vishwaas tha ki audyogikaran ho
 He saw that the woman had no freedom
 ve log bhoga kii vastu samajhi jaati thim
 Dr
 Besant's heart was moved by this sad state
 unhone nari suraksha kaa prashn uthaaya or jor dekar kaha ki samaaj main sarvangin vikaas ke liye nari adhikaron ko surakshit karnaa aavashyak he
 Dr
 Besant was an advocate of the ancient religion based varna system
 varna vyavastha kaa mukhya uddeshy kaary vibhaajan tha jiske anusaar samaaj kaa prayek vyakti apane kaaryon ko karne kii yogyata dwaara brahman, kshatriya, vaisya evam shudra kaa sthaan praapt karata tha
 She used to say that according to Mahabharata, a Brahmin has the qualities of a Shudra and is a Shudra
 shudra main agar brahman ke gun hai to vah brahman samajha jaayga
 Traveling abroad was considered irreligious at that time
 unhone bataaya ki pracheen aitihaasik tathyon se pataa chalata he ki shyaam, java, sumatra, kamboj, lanka, tibet tathaa china aadi deshon main hindu rajya ke chihn paye gayi hai
 Hence, foreign travel of Hindus is certified

 This enlightened class is a product of that country's education
 at: shiksha vyavastha ko ve atyadhik mahatv detii thim
 He insisted that religious and moral education should be compulsorily taught in education courses and to be based on ancient Indian ideals
 unki dharna thi ki prayek bhartiya ko sanskrit tathaa angreji donon kaa gyaan hona chaiye
 From 1913 to 1919 she was one of the leading personalities in Indian political life
 sitambar 1916 main unhone homerul lig kii sthapana kii or swarajya ke adarsh ko lokapriy banane ke liye prachaar kiya kintu 1919 ke baad ve akeli pad gayi
 The immediate reason for this was his dispute with Bal Gangadhar Tilak
 jab gandhi ji ne apana satyagrah aandolan prarambh kiya to vah bhartiya raajnneeti kii mukhya dhara se or bhi pruthak ho gai
 It is a matter of great misfortune that Annie Besant condemned Gandhiji's non-cooperation movement in a very unsympathetic language, describing his movement as revolutionary, anarchist, and a movement that exudes hatred and violence
 gandhi ke darshan evam netritv ko unhone swatantraaa ke maarg main sabase badi baadha bataaya tha
 He described Gandhiji as an obscure swaraj watcher and a mystic politician
 unhen is baat se sandeh tha ki gandhi ji sachche hriday se pashchaatap, upwas, tapasya aadi main vishwaas karte hai
 He warned the people of the country that if the Gandhian system was adopted, the country would again fall into the ravine of anarchy
