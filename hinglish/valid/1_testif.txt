 It comes after Tuesday and before Thursday
 buudhvaar kaa yah naam budh se padaa he jiskaa matlab ek hindu devtaa se he
 Wise story ek samay kisi nagar main ek bahut hi dhanwaan sahukaar rahata tha
 The moneylender was married to a beautiful and talented girl from the city
 ek baar wo apni patni ko lene buudhvaar ke din sasuraal gaya or patni ke mata-pita se vidaa karaane ke liye kaha
 mata-pita bole- betaa aaj buudhvaar he
 On Wednesday, do not travel for any auspicious work
 But he did not agree and he said not to obey the words of Vaham
 Both started the journey with bullock cart
 One wheel of his car broke after a trip to two Kos
 vahaan se donon ne paidal hi yatra shuru kii
 raste main patni ko pyaas lagi to sahukaar use ek ped ke neeche baitaakar jal lene ke liye chalaa gaya
 After a while, when he came back with water from somewhere, he was very surprised, because another person of his face was sitting near his wife
 patni bhi sahukaar ko dekhakar hairaan rah gai
 She could not make any difference between the two
 The moneylender asked the person- who are you and why are you sitting near my wife
 Hearing the money lender, the person said- Hey brother, this is my wife
 main apni patni ko sasuraal se vidaa kara kar laayaa hum, lekin tum koun ho jo mujhase aisa prashn kar rahe ho?sahukaar ne lagbhag cheekhte hue kaha- tum zarur koi chor yaa thag ho
 yah meri patni he
 i went to sit under a tree and take water
 is par us vyakti ne kaha- are bhai, jhooth to tum bol rahe ho
 patni ko pyaas lagane par jal lene to main gaya tha
 i have also brought water and given my wife a drink
 ab tum chupchaap yahaan se chalate bano nahin to kisi sipaahi ko bulaakar tumhen pakadava duungaa
donon ek-duusare se ladane lage
 unhen ladate dekh bahut se log vahaan ekatra ho gaye
 Some soldiers of the city also came there
 sipaahi un donon ko pakadakar raja ke paas le gaye
 The king too could not make a decision after hearing the whole story
 patni bhi un donon main se apane vaastavik pati ko nahin pahchaan paa rahi thi
 The king asked them to put them both in jail
 The real moneylender was horrified to hear the king's decision
 Then there was the AIR - the moneylender, you did not listen to the parents and departed from your in-laws on Wednesday
 yah sab bhagwaan budhdev ke prakope se ho rahaa he
 The moneylender prayed to Lord Buddha, that Lord Lord Buddha forgive me
 i made a big mistake
 In future, i will never travel on Wednesday and will always observe you on Wednesday
 Pleased with the moneylender's prayer, Lord Budhdev forgave him
 Then the other person disappeared from the king
 raja or duusare log is chamatkaar ko dekhakar hairaan ho gaye
 Due to the grace of Lord Buddha, the king sent the moneylender and his wife respectfully away
 kuch dur chalane par raste main unhen baiylgaadee mil gai
 The broken wheel of the bullock cart was also attached
 donon usamen baithkar nagar kii ore chal die
 sahukaar or uski patni donon buudhvaar kaa vrath karte hue anandpurvak jivan-yaapan karne lage
 bhagwaan budhdev kii anukampaa se unke ghar main dhan-sampatti kii varsha hone lagi
 jald hi unke jivan main khushiyaan hi khushiyaan bhar gai
 By observing Wednesday, all the wishes in the life of men and women are fulfilled

 taksaal us kaarkaane ko kehete hai jahaan desh kii sarkaar dwaara, yaa uske die adhikaar se, mudraon kaa nirmaan hota he
 The mints in India are in Calcutta, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Noida, Uttar Pradesh
 mudraon kaa sarvapratham nirmaan sambhavat: isa purv aathvin shatabdi main laghu asia ke ledia pradesh main hua
 Around the same time, their practice began in China and from there their practice spread to Japan and Korea
 nishchit rup se kahana kathin he ki bharat main inkaa nirmaan kab prarambh hua, kintu chauthi shatabdi isa purv main avashya ho gaya tha
 Since ancient times, currencies have been made of metal
 is kaary ke liye electrum, sona, chaandi tanba ore kaanse kaa prayog hota aayaa he
 Apart from these, lead, iron, aluminum and nickel have also been used in modern times
 pehle shuddh sone yaa chaandi kii mudra banane ko mahatv diya jaataa tha, kyonki vyapaar main anya deshon ke log aisi mudraon ko saharsha sweekaar kar lete the, kintu yah dekha gaya ki sona yaa chaandi main taanbe kaa yoga dene se na keval dhaatu kaa mulya kam padataa he varan usamen kathorta aa jane ke kaaran mudraayen sheeghra ghisti nahin ore chalan main adhik din rah paati hai
 But the decay can also be caused by rust or rusting and the presence of a large amount of copper causes this defect
 at: yah aavashyak he ki taanbe kii milawat itani hi kii jaae ki sanksharan na hone paae
 The first gold and silver coins in the Greek country were made of pure metal, but copper was added to them during the time of the Roman emperors
 rome samrajya ke antim kaal ke sikkon main do pratishat, yaa isse bhi kam, sone kaa ansh hota tha
 Pure metals began to behave again in medieval Western Europe
 england main 22 carat ke sone kaa vyavhaar san 1526 se aarambh hua
 In England of the Saxon period, there used to be 3 parts alloys in 40 parts of silver coins, but later it started adding more faults
 san 1920 main chaandi kaa ansh aadha baandh diya gaya
 In France and in many other countries, gold and silver coins, both ten and nine parts, contain nine percent pure metal
 bharat main san 1941 tak inhen donon dhaatuon ke sikkon ke 12 ansh main 11 ansh shuddh dhaatu rahati thi, par is varsh ke pashchaat chaandi ke sikkon main chaandi kaa bhaag aadha kar diya gaya
 In the United States of America, since 1934, nine out of ten parts of pure gold and 15 5 / 21 grains of gold in circulation started trending

 Before 1946, silver coins of this country had 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper
 choti mudraon ke liye france ne 95 pratishat tanba, 4 pratishat tin or 1 pratishat jaste kaa prayog aarambh kiya or isaki dekha-dekhi praaia: anya sab desh bhi yahi karne lage
 In 1861, in place of silver, the use of a copper metal in Belgium, which consists of 75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel, started
 1947 se mudraon main chaandi ke sthaan par isi dhaatu kaa prayog england main aarambh hua or sheeghra hi anya deshon main bhi hone laga
 Nickel-brass coins, which contain 79 per cent copper, 20 per cent zinc and 1 per cent nickel, are made in many countries

 In ancient times, mudras were made by placing them between engraved slaps and hamming them
 bharat ke deshi rajyon main yah reeti 19veen shatee tak prachlit thi
 Coins were also minted somewhere
 aadhunik taksaalon main nirmaankarya mukhyat: mashiinon dwaara sampadit hota he
 It is completed in eight terms- mudranirmaan ke liye dhaatu kaa shodhan - is kaary ke liye vidyut apghaton vidhi apanaai jaati he; Melted in a mixture of pure metals, silon ko belkar pattiyaan bananaa - yah kaary dhaali hui silon, yaa paason, ko barbar kai belanon ke bich se nikaalkar puraa kiya jaataa he
 The last cylinder has the lowest diameter
 jab vaanchit motaai kii pattiyaan praapt ho jaati hai tab inamen se ek yaa do chaktiyaan katkar tauli jaati hai
 If it becomes too heavy, then roll the bandage and thin it; nirank chakatiyon ko mashiinon dwaara kaatna ; Temperature and cleaning of rashes - When the chaktis are heated in the furnaces, they cool down, which makes them somewhat tender

 Acid is removed by washing and then it is dried
 chakatiyon kaa sthulan - belan dwaara unke kinaaron ko uthaa hua banaaya jaataa he
 This is because in practice the figures of the prepared currency are not worn
 isi samay kinaaron par akshar, yaa koi dizin, daal di jaati he
 Some such Indian coins have standing stripes or teeth on them

 Sadosh removes the strangles and strangles again
 chakatiyon ko thappon ke bich main dabaakar mudra bananaa - prayek chakti nichevale thappe par rakhi jaati he or uuparavaala thappa usapar jor se aakar girtaa he
 Soft metal, like pressure, fills the spots of the slap, like a solid, but at the time of injury the swatch encloses a girdle, causing the swatch to not extend to the width
 yah sab kaam ab yantra se hota he
 The swabs are made of hardened carbon steel
 inamen se prayek lagbhag 50,000 mudraayen banane ke pashchaat kaam kaa nahin rahata
 Finally, every posture is examined by looking at it and weighing it
 dekhne vaale ke sammukh ye mudraayen chalapatton par rakhi is prakaar aati hai ki pari pari se unka chit or patt bhaag upar aa jaataa he
 Other than lower denomination currencies, other weights are also checked

 The postures come out of the mint only after the true landing in the aforesaid examinations
 vah vidhi he jiske dwaara yah jaanch kii jaati he ki sikkon kii mishradhaatuon main bhinn bhinn dhaatuon kaa anupaat nirdhaarit seemaa ke anusaar he yaa nahin
 Coins are usually made from an alloy of two or more metals
 mishradhatu kii avyav dhaatuon kaa anupaat nishchit rup se nirdhaarit rahata he
 The ratio of alloy to component metals remains fixed
 sikaa banane ke purv, mishradhatu kii avasthaa main hi, aamapan adhik mahatvapurn hota he
 After the coin is created, the specimen may be tested as it is
 sikke main yadi ek hi dhaatu ho to dhaatu or sikaa donon kaa aamapan samaan rup se aavashyak he, jisase dhaatu main aise hanikaarak apdravya na pravisht ho jaaen jinase sikaa nirmaan kii anek avasthaaon main dhaatu kii kaaryakarita or gunon par gambhir kuprabhav pade, yaa prachlit ho jane par sikke ke gunon main antar ho jaae
 Coins have been made in India with alloys of bronze, copper-nickel, nickel-gall and silver
 shuddh nikal kaa prayog 1946 i
 main, jab sikkon main chaandi kaa prayog dhire dhire samaapt kiya jane laga, prarambh hua
 Copper, tin and zinc in copper coins, copper, copper and nickel in nickel coins, copper, nickel and zinc in nickel-brass coins, and silver are generally used in silver coins
 shuddh nikal ke sikkon main nikal or hanikaarak apdravya ke rup main karvan, gandhak aadi kaa aamapan hota he
 a brief description of the methods of sedimentation of metals is given below
 taanbe ke aganan kii do vidhiyaan hai, aaytanmetiya vidhi or bharmetiya vidhi
 In this, the tempered portion of the alloy or coin is dissolved in dilute nitric acid by heating
 abhikriya kii samaapti or sikke ke tukade ke purnat: villin hone par vilyan ko vashmpikaran dwaara lagbhag sukha lete hai
 On the bronze coin, after filtering the released tin oxide, wash it thoroughly with water and add so much ammonium hydroxide to the solution or filtrate that it becomes less ammoniacal
 iske baad is vilyan main thos potacium iodide, yaa uskaa sandra vilyan milaate hai, jisase iodone unmukt hota he
 Starch solutions are titrated with standard sodium thiosulfate with iodine released as an indicator
 isi vidhi se shuddh vidyudvishleshit taanbe ke prati anmapan karke sodium thayosulphate kaa maanakeekaran karte hai
 In this, the weighed quantities of the coin or alloy dissolve in a mixture of dilute sulfuric and nitric acid
 yadi aavashyak ho to mishradhatu ke purnat: villin hone par vilyan ko chaan lete he or uskaa tanukaran karke, uske andar tula hua platinum gaanz ore platinum taar rakhkar, bydaree ke rin tathaa dhan dhruvon se jodakar vilyan kaa vidyut apghaton karte hai
 The copper oxide is stored on the garage
 sanchayakriya purna hone par ganj ko pani or alcohal se dhone ke baad suukhaakar taulate hai
 By increasing the weight of the carve, the amount of copper in the weighed volume of the coin or alloy taken for measurement is known, from which the percentage of copper is calculated
 isamen mishradhatu yaa sikke ke tule hue pariman ko tanu nitric amla main, aavashyak hua to taapan dwaara, villin karte hai
 After the alloy is completely dissolved, the solution is placed on the hot metal plate, concentrating and re-diluting, then placing it on the heated metal plate, so that the released tin oxide settles down
 tin oxid main filterpatr kii thodi si lugdi milakar chaante hai or chhanit ko taanbe se mukt hone tak ek pratishat nitric amla se acchhee tarah ghote hai
 After drying the precipitates, they are cooled and ignited in the bent head of porcelain
 is prrkaar praapt tin oxid ke bhaar se sikke yaa mishradhatu main tin kaa pratishat maaloom ho jaataa he
 If the coin or alloy has copper and tin, after separating it, the weighty approximation of the nickel present in the residual solution is done as follows
 daai-methil glai oxim lavan ke rup main, sikke yaa mishradhatu ko upyukt reeti se amla main villin kiya jaataa he
 The dilute ammonium hydroxide mixture is diluted by diluting the appropriate amount of solution to make it slightly alkaline
 vilyan ko garam karte hai or garam vilyan main daai-methil-glai-oxim kaa alkohli vilyan adhikta ke saath milaate hai, jisase nikal laal yogic ke rup main avakshipt ho jaataa he
 After this, the solution is made clear by ammonium hydroxide, alkaline and left on the hot metal plate to freeze
 iske baad laal yogic ko tauli hui chhidrit musha main chaanakar or dhokar, bhaar ke sthir hone tak 1200-1250 sein
 tak garam karte hai
 Calculate the percentage of nickel in the coin or alloy with the weight of the red yogic obtained in this way
 nikal mudra main nikal kam se kam 99 pratishat rahanaa chahie
 The impurities include iron 0
2 per cent, carbon 0
6 per cent and sulfur 0
004 per cent excusable
 vidyut apghaton aganan - taanbe ke samaan nikal kaa bhi vaidyut aganan kiya ja saktaa he
 Ammonium sulphate is added to it by separating copper and tin, and if the ammonium is dissolved in a solution, from the weighed fraction of the coin or alloy
 jaisaa taanbe ke vidyudvishleshik nirdhaaran ke antargat vanit he, cell ke runagra platinum ganj par is vilyan kaa sara nikal sanchit hota he
 Thus the percentage of nickel in the alloy is calculated by the weight of the accumulated nickel

 Acharya of the temple, Hari Om Pathak, tells that the mother Pitambara, who is in the form of the quadrilateral, has mace in one hand, loop in the other, Vajra in the third and in the fourth hand, she has held the tongue of the demon

 lekin is darbar main bhakton ko maa ke darshan ek choti si khidki se hi hote hai
 darshanathiyon ko maa kii pratimaa ko sparsh karne kii manaahi he
 It is believed that Mother Bagulamukhi is the Pitambara Devi, so yellow things are offered to her
 But pleasing the mother is not so easy
 For this, special rituals have to be done, in which the devotee has to wear yellow clothes, yellow things are offered to the mother and then they are asked to ask
 kehete hai vidhi vidhaan se agar anushthathan kar liya jaae to maa jald hi puri kar detii hai bhakton kii manokamana
 maa peetambara ko rajasatta kii devi mana jaataa he or isi rup main bhakt unki aradhana karte hai

 Along with the mother Pitambara in the temple, the fortunes of Khandeshwar Mahadev and Dhumavati are also found
 On the right side of the temple sits Khandeshwar Mahadev, who is worshiped in a tantric form
 As soon as Mahadev steps out of the court, one of the ten Mahavidyas, mother Dhumavati is seen
 The most unique thing is that the devotees get the fortunes to see Maa Dhumavati only during the aarti, because the doors of the temple remain closed for the rest of the time
 maa peetambara ke vaibhav se sabhi kii manokamana puri hoti he
 bhakton ko sukh samruddhi or shanti milti he, yahi vajah he ki maa ke darbar main dur dur se bhakt aate hai, maa kii mahima gaate hai or jholii main khushiyaan bhar kar ghar le jate hai

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, sparsh-sangharshi yaa sangharshi vyanjanon main badal gayi, jaise : c, ja, sa or sha
 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d
 inamen baltic, slav, hind irani, armenian or albanian shakhan aati hai
 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai
 According to Hittler, the Germans are of the highest and almighty race, and the Jewish people in particular are of inferior and non-aryan race

 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race
 par abhi bhi itihaaskaar or bhashavid aaryon kii janmabhumi kii khoj kar rahe hai
 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea
 vahiin se unke kabeeley duniya ke kai deshon main pahunche
 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians
 us vaqt tak sindhu-ghati sabhyataa yaa to bhukampon se yaa sindhu-saraswati nadiyon kii dhara main badlaav or sookhe kii vajah se khud hi tabah ho gayi thi
 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians
 madhya asia ke "kurgan kabr-tile" pracheen aaryon dwaara banaaye gayi maane jate hai
 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia
 is baat ko kai bhartiya or hindutv-vaadi maanate hai, par baaki duniya main is drushtikon kii koi kadra nahin he
 According to most linguists, the reconstructed words of the "primitive-indo-european" language indicate that the ancient Aryan birthplace was a large, temperate grass pasture
 vaise bhi bhartiya jalwaayu or pashu-pakshiyon ke shabdon ke liye unani, latin, german or anya hind-europea bhashaaon main milte julate shabd nahin milte, jaise mor, murga, baagh, hathi, aam, kelaa, pipal, bargad, neem, garm-mausam, ganda, bhens, chaaval, ityadi

 The show was a hugely successful Disney effort to create a high quality animation series for TV
 Disney invested a lot more money on this TV series than it had previously spent on an animated show

 Most episodes of ducktales were being animated by Kookus Nest Studios in Asia, Wang Film Production and Tokyo Movie Shinsha of Japan
 kai aalochakonka kahana he ki dijani ke khud ke anemeshan studio ne apni chamak 1980 ke dashak main walt dijani ke guzarane ke dauraan kho di thi
 However, the studio took a number of risks that were highly rewarding and ducktales was one of those risks that made a huge profit
 The studios gambled thinking that a large investment in quality animation would be returned by syndication â an idea that was suitable for recycling with live TV broadcasts, but which was only used with such inexpensive cartoon series , Which were remade from decades-old theater scenes or were low-budget animation limited to feature

 In addition to these, there is a study of George Grierson in other authentic records, in which he has considered the birth date of Mahakavi as 1610

 Indian classical music or Marg is an integral part of Indian music

 While it can be understood only by the habitual ear of the classical music-sounding practice, the unaccustomed ear can also take pleasure in native songs or folk songs by knowing the meaning of words
 isse anek log swaabhaavik hi ub bhi jate hai par iske oobane kaa kaaran us sangitajna kii kamajori nahin, logon main jaankaree kii kami he
 The tradition of Indian classical music goes back to the Natyashastra of Bharata Muni and the singing of Samaveda before that
 bharat muni dwaara rachit bharat natya shaastra, bhartiya sangeet ke itihaas kaa pratham likhit pramaan mana jaataa he
 There are many differences regarding the timing of its creation

 After the Natyashastra of Bharata Muni, the musical Ratnakar, composed by Matang Muni's Brihadeeshi and Sharangadeva, is considered historically the most important book
 barahavin sadi ke purvarddh main likhe saat adhyyon vaale is granth main sangeet va nrity kaa vistaar se varnan he
 Many rhythms are mentioned in Sangeet Ratnakar and this text shows that ancient Indian traditional music had started changing and music had already started becoming liberal but the basic elements remained the same
 11veen or 12veen shatabdi main muslim sabhyataa ke prasar ne uttar bhartiya sangeet kii disha ko nayaa aayam diya
 The royal court became the main patron of music and while many rulers encouraged the rich tradition of ancient Indian music, they also made many changes to it according to their need and interest

 Modern practitioners of Indian music have established that the journey of Indian instruments started from the Vedic period was followed by the introduction of these instruments from one feature to another
 ek-tantri veena hi tritantri bani or sarika yukt hokar madhya-kaal ke purv kinnari veena ke naam se prasiddh hui
 In the medieval period, this machine came to be known as Jantra, which is still called by the artisans of Bengal

 Whereas the music practiced in South India remained untouched by some kind of Muslim influence

 It became popular in South India

 Goswami Tulsidas was a great poet of Hindi literature
 inkaa janm soron shukarakshetra, vartmaan main kasganj uttar pradesh main hua tha
 Some scholars believe you were born in Rajapur district Banda
 inhen aadi kavy ramayana ke rachayita maharishi valmiki kaa avatar bhi mana jaataa he
 The story of Sriramcharitmanas is taken from Ramayana
 ramcharitamanas lok granth he or ise uttar bharat main bade bhakthibhaav se padhaa jaataa he
 After this, Vinaya Patrika is another important poem of his
 mahakavy shriramcharitamanas ko vishwa ke 100 sarvshereshth lokapriy kaavyon main 46vaan sthaan diya gaya
 Most scholars are in favor of considering Rajapur, the birth place of Tulsidas
 yadhyapi kuch ise soron shukarakshetra bhi maanate hai
 Rajapur is a village located in the Chitrakoot district of Uttar Pradesh
 vahaan atmaram dube naam ke ek pratishthit sarauparin brahman rahete the
 His wife's name was Hulasi
 sanwat 1511 ke shravan maas ke shuklapaksh kii saptami tithi ke din abhukt mul nakshatra main inhen dampati ke yahan tulsidas kaa janm hua
 According to popular folklore, the baby was extremely strong due to being in the mother's womb for twelve months and the teeth were visible in her mouth
 janm lene ke saath hi usne ram naam kaa uccharan kiya jisase uskaa naam rambola pad gaya
 Mother died on the second day of her birth
 pita ne kisi or anisht se bachane ke liye balak ko chuniyaan naam kii ek daasi ko saunp diya or swayan virakt ho gayi
 When Rambola was five and a half years old, Chuniya was also no more
 vah gali-gali bhatakta hua anathon kii tarah jivan jeene ko vivash ho gaya
 With the inspiration of Lord Shankarji, Shri Ananthanandji, a dear disciple of Shri Anantanand Ji, who lived on Ramshail, found this child who had become famous by the name of this Rambola and duly named it Tulsiram
 taduparant ve use ayodhya le gayi or vahaan sanwat 1561 magh shukla panchami ko uskaa yagyopavit-sanskaar sampann karaayaa
 At the time of the rites, even without being taught, the child Rambola pronounced Gayatri-mantra, which surprised everyone
 iske baad narhari baba ne vaishnavon ke paanch sanskaar karke balak ko ram-mantra kii diksha di or ayodhya main hi rahakar use vidyadhyayan karaayaa
 The wisdom of the child Rambola was very sharp
 vah ek hi baar main guru-mukh se jo sun letaa, use vah kanthsth ho jaataa
 From there, after some time, both the teacher and the disciple reached the sugar field
 vahaan narhari baba ne balak ko ram-katha sunaayi kintu vah use bhalee-bhanti samaj na aayi
 Jyeshtha Shukla Trayodashi, on Thursday, 1583, at the age of 29, was married to Kanya Ratnavali of the very beautiful Bharadwaja gotra, a village on the far side of the Yamuna, a little away from Rajapur
 chunki gauna nahin hua tha at: kuch samay ke liye ve kaashi chale gayi or vahaan sheshasnathan ji ke paas rahakar veda-vedang ke adhyayan main jute gayi
 While living there, suddenly one day he remembered his wife and started getting distraught
 jab nahin rahaa gaya to guruuji se ajna lekar ve apni janmabhumi rajapur laut aaye
 Since his wife Ratnavali was in the maternal house as he had not become a cowherd by then, Tulsiram swam across the sweltering Yamuna river in the dark dark night and went straight to his wife's bedroom
 ratnavali itani raat gayi apane pati ko akele aayaa dekh kar aashcharyachakit ho gayi
 When he asked them to return quietly in fear of public shame, they started urging him to go home at the same time
 unki is apratyaashit jid se khijhakar ratnavali ne swarchit ek dohe ke madhyam se jo shiksha unhen di usne hi tulsiram ko tulsidas bana diya
 The Doha that Ratnavali said was as follows: yah doha sunate hi unhone usee samay patni ko vahiin uske pita ke ghar chhod diya or waapas apane gaanv rajapur laut gayi
 On going to his house in Rajapur, when he came to know that his father was not there in his absence and the whole house was destroyed, he suffered even more
 unhone vidhi-vidhaan purvak apane pita ji kaa shraadh kiya or gaanv main hi rahakar logon ko bhagwaan ram kii katha sunaane lage
 After staying in Rajapur for some time, he again went to Kashi and started telling Ram Katha to the people there
 katha ke dauraan unhen ek din manushya ke vesh main ek pret mila, jisane unhen hanuman ji kaa pataa batalaaya
 Tulsidas, meeting Hanumanji, requested him to have darshan of Shri Raghunathji
 hanumanji ne kaha- "tumhen chitrakoot main raghunathji darshan hongen
 "on this Tulsidas ji started towards Chitrakoot
 chitrakoot pahunch kar unhone ramghat par apana asana jamaaya
 One day he went for circumambulation when suddenly in his way he saw Shri Ram
 unhone dekha ki do bade hi sundar rajkumaar ghodon par savaar hokar dhanush-baan liye ja rahe hai
 Tulsidas was attracted to see them, but could not recognize them
 tabhi peeche se hanumanji ne aakar jab unhen sara bhed bataaya to ve pashchaatap karne lage
 On this, Hanumanji consoled him and said that he would be seen again in the morning
 sanwat 1607 kii mauni amavasya ko buudhvaar ke din unke saamne bhagwaan shriram punah prakat hue
 He came as a child and said to Tulsidas - "baba! We want sandalwood, can you give us sandalwood?" Hanumanji thought, "may he not be deceived this time too, so he took the form of a parrot and said this couplet:" tulsidas shriram ji kii us adbhut chhavi ko nihaar kar apane sharir kii sud-budh hi bhul gayi
 Ultimately, God himself took the sandal from his hand and applied it on his and Tulsidas Ji's forehead and disappeared
 sanwat 1628 main vah hanuman ji kii ajna lekar ayodhya kii ore chal pade
 In those days, there was a Magh Mela in Prayag
 ve vahaan kuch din ke liye thahar gayi
 Six days after the festival, he saw Bharadwaja and Yajnavalkya Muni under a vatavriksha
 vahaan us samay vahi katha ho rahi thi, jo unhone sukarakshetra main apane guru se suni thi
 At the end of the Magh Mela, Tulsidas came back to Kashi from Prayag and resided at the house of a Brahmin at Prahladghat
 vahiin rahete hue unke andar kavitv-shakti kaa prasphuran hua or ve sanskrit main padya-rachana karne lage
 But all the verses he composed in the day, all of them would disappear in the night
 yah ghatana roj ghatati
 Tulsidas ji had a dream on the eighth day
 bhagwaan shankar ne unhen aadesh diya ki tum apni bhashaa main kavy rachana karo
 Tulsidas ji got sleepy
 ve uthakar baith gayi
 At the same time Lord Shiva and Parvati appeared to him
 tulsidas ji ne unhen sashtaang pranaam kiya
 Pleased on this, Shiva said - "you go to Ayodhya and write poetry in Hindi
 mere aashirwad se tumhaari kavita samaveda ke samaan falvati hogi
 "gaurishankar got into trouble after saying so
 tulsidas ji unki ajna shirodharya kar kaashi se sidhe ayodhya chale gayi
 The year 1631 started
 daivayog se us varsh ramanavami ke din vaisaa hi yoga aayaa jaisaa tretayug main ram-janm ke din tha
 That morning Tulsidas ji started the creation of Shri Ramcharitmanas
 do varsh, saat maheene or chhbbees din main yah adbhut granth sampann hua
 On the day of Rama's marriage in Margashirsha Shuklapaksa, in the year 1633, the seven scams were completed
 iske baad bhagwaan kii ajna se tulsidas ji kaashi chale aaye
 There he narrated Sri Ramacharitmanas to Lord Vishwanath and Mother Annapurna
 raat ko pustak vishwanath-mandir main rakh di gayi
 When the doors of the temple were opened in the morning, it was found written on the book - Satya Shivam Sundaram under which Lord Shankar was right
 us samay vahaan upasthit logon ne "satyam shivan sundaram" kii aawaaj bhi kaanon se suni
 Here, when the Pandits of Kashi came to know about this, their heart enraged
 ve dal banaakar tulsidas ji kii ninda or us pustak ko nasht karne kaa praytn karne lage
 He also sent two thieves to steal the book
 choron ne jaakar dekha ki tulsidas ji kii kuti ke aasapaas do yuvak dhanushbaan liye paharaa de rahe hai
 Both the youngsters were very beautiful, Shyam and Gaur Varna respectively
 unke darshan karte hi choron kii buddhi shuddh ho gayi
 He stopped stealing from that time and started worshiping the Lord
 tulsidas ji ne apane liye bhagavan ko ksht hua jaan kuti kaa sara samaan lutaa diya or pustak apane mitra todermal ke yahan rakhwa di
 He then wrote another copy with his unique memory
 usee ke aadhaar par duusari pratilipiyaan taiyaar kii gayin or pustak kaa prachaar dinon-din badhane laga
 Here the Pandits of Kashi, seeing no other remedy, prayed to the Mahapandit named Shri Madhusudan Saraswati to give his consent after seeing that book
 madhusudan saraswati ji ne use dekhakar badi prasannataa prakat kii or us par apni ore se yah tippanee likh di- Its meaning in Hindi is as follows - "tulsidas is a walking and moving plant of Tulsi in the joy-forest of Kashi
 uski kavy-manjari badi hi manohar he, jis par shriram rupi bhanvaraa sadaa mandraata rahata he
 " panditon ko unki is tippanee par bhi santosh nahin hua
 Then another way of examining the book was thought of
 kaashi ke vishwanath-mandir main bhagavan vishwanath ke saamne sabase upar veda, unke neeche shaastra, shastron ke neeche puraana or sabake neeche ramcharitamanas rakh diya gaya
 When the temple was opened in the morning, people saw that Sri Ramacharitmanas was placed on the Vedas
 ab to sabhi pandit bade lajjit hue
 He apologized to Tulsidas ji and took his footsteps with devotion
 tulsidas ji jab kaashi ke vikhyat ghat asighat par rahane lage to ek raat kaliyug moort rup dhaaran kar unke paas aayaa or unhen pidaa pahunchaane laga
 Tulsidas ji meditated on Hanuman ji at the same time
 hanuman ji ne saakshaat prakat hokar unhen prarthana ke pad rachane ko kaha, iske pashchaat unhone apni antim kriti vinay-patrika likhi or use bhagwaan ke charnon main samarpit kar diya
 Shri Ram ji himself signed it and made Tulsidas ji fearless
 sanwat 1680 main shravan krishna tritiya shanivaar ko tulsidas ji ne "ram-ram" kehete hue apana sharir parityag kiya
 Tulsidas ji's handwriting was highly beautiful as it was the art of calography in that era
 unke janm-sthaan rajapur ke ek mandir main shriramcharitamanas ke ayodhyakand kii ek prati surakshit rakhi hui he
 The following two verses were also published by Indraprastha Bharati, a magazine of Hindi Academy Delhi, outlining the personality and gratitude of Tulsi in the manuscript of Madanlal Varma 'krant', a poet with the same copy
 inamen pehla chand simhavlokan he jisaki visheshta yah he ki prayek charan jis shabd se samaapt hota he usase aage kaa usee se praranbh hota he
 The first and last words also remain the same
 kavyashastra main ise adbhut chand kaha gaya he
 The same verses were also published in the Tulsi Jayanti special issue of Sahityaprikaprama, another magazine
 apane 126 varsh ke deergh jivan-kaal main tulsidas ne kalkrmanusaar nimnlikhit kaaljayi granthon kii rachanaayen kin - Of these, the praise of a poet seems to be accurate in the works of Ramcharitmanas, Vinaya Patrika, Kavitavali, Geetavali - Pasya Devasya Poetry, Neither Mrnoti nor Jeerati
 arthath devpurushon kaa kavy dekhiye jo na marataa na purana hota he
 About four hundred years ago Tulsidas ji composed his creations
 aadhunik prakaashan-suvidhaon se rahit us kaal main bhi tulsidas kaa kavy jan-jan tak pahunch chukaa tha
 This is a direct proof of his popularization as a poet
 maanas jaise vrihad granth ko kanthsth karke saamaanya padhe likhe log bhi apni shuchita evam gyaan ke liye prasiddh hone lage the
 Ramcharitmanas has been the most popular text of Tulsidas ji
 unhone apni rachanaaon ke sambandh main kahin koi ullekh nahin kiya he, isliye pramanik rachanaaon ke sambandh main ant:sakshya kaa abhaav dikhaayi detaa he
 The books published by Nagari Pracharini Sabha Kashi are as follows: 'encychlopedia of religen and athiks' main grearsan ne bhi uparokt pratham baarah granthon kaa ullekh kiya he
 This is a rite of passage
 is geet main katipay ullekh ram-vivaah kii katha se bhinn hai
 Vairagya Sandipani is considered unnatural by Mata Prasad Gupta, but Acharya Chandrawali Pandey considers it authentic and an early creation of Tulsi
 kuch or pracheen pratiyon ke uplabdh hone se thos pramaan mil sakate hai
 The first Sorta of Saint Mahima's description is - vidwaanon ne ise tulsi kii rachana ghoshit kiya he
 In terms of style, it is an authentic creation of Tulsidas
 isaki khandit prati hi granthawali main sampadit he
 It appears to be an authentic creation of Tulsi
 isaki kaavyatmak praudhata tulsi siddhant ke anukool he
 The poem is simple, comprehensively interesting and succulent
 ""jagat maatu pitu sambhu bhavani"" kii shringaarik cheshtaaon kaa tanik bhi put nahin he
 The folk tradition is so status quo that it is less influenced by Sanskrit poetry of Sanskrit, and Tulsi's narrative narrative on the devotional role of Mati
 vyavhaaron kii sushthuta, prem kii ananyta or vaivaahik kaarykram kii sarasata ko badi saavdhaanee se kavi ne ankit kiya he
 Tulsidas was very satisfied with his creation, that is why this unhappy devotee has praised his mother only once - vidwaanon ne ise tulsidas kii pramanik rachanaaon main sthaan diya he
 But it also has intercept
 tulsi ke maanas ke purv valmikiy ramayana kii katha hi lok prachlit thi
 Tulsidas's differences with the pandits of Kashi about Tulsidas and Vishwanath's signature on the copy of Manas are famous
 yah jyotish shastreey paddati kaa granth he
 Divided into couplets, saptakas and cantos, this book is a mixed composition of various Mars and amalgamous episodes of Ramakatha
 kavy kii drushti se is granth kaa mahatva naganya he
 All consider it to be tulsified
 isamen katha-shrinkhalaa kaa abhaav he or valmikiy ramayana ke prasangon kaa anuwaad anek dohon main he
 Most of the couplets in Dohavali are of Manas
 kavi ne chatak ke vyaaj se dohon kii ek lambii shrinkhalaa likhakar bhakthi or prem kii vyakhya kii he
 Dohavali is a Doha collection
 maanas ke bhi kuch katha nirpeksh dohon ko isamen sthaan he
 It is possible that some couplets will also be projected in it, but the opaqueness of the composition is unquestionable
 kavitawali tulsidas kii rachana he, par sabha sanskaran athwa anya sanskarnon main prakashit yah rachana puri nahin prathit hoti he
 Kavitavali is a management work
 kathanak main apraasangikta evam shithilataa tulsi kii kala kaa kalank kaha jaayegaa
 The basis of the songs in Gitavali has been Ramcharit of various scandal
 yah granth ramcharitamanas kii tarah vyapak jansampark main kam gaya prathit hota he
 Hence the changes in these songs are not visible
 gitavali main geeton ke katha - sandarbh tulsi kii mati ke anuroop hai
 From this point of view a song of Geetavali can be taken - isamen bharat or ram ke sheel kaa utkarsh tulsidas ne vyakt kiya he
 The Uttarakand of Geethavali has more detail than the story of Manas
 isamen sita kaa valmiki ashram main bheja janaa varnit he
 The justification for this abandonment is found in these lines - shrikrishna gitavali bhi goswamiji kii rachana he
 Certain episodes of Shri krishna-katha are the subject of songs
 yah goswami ji kii hanumat-bhakthi sambandhi rachana he
 But this is an independent work
 iske sabhi ansh pramanik prathit hote hai
 Tulsidas loved Rama, the story of Rama was lovely, Rama was cute and Rama was cute
 unki buddhi, raag, kalpana or bhavukta par ram kii maryaada or lila kaa aadhipaty tha
 The image of Ram resided in his eyes
 sab kuch ram kii paavan lila main vyakt hua he jo ramkavy kii parampara kii ucchtam uplabdhi he

 jaise-ladkaa, gaay, sipaahi, baccha, kapadaa, mata, maala, pustak, stri, topi bandar, mor aadi
 The plural form of the word is called plural

 The main objective of the Congress was to resolve many issues and problems arising from the French Revolutionary War, the Napoleonic War and the disintegration of the Holy Roman Empire
 napolian ko waterlu kii paraajay ke pashchaat saint helena dweep nirvasit kar diya gaya, tatpashchaat austria kii rajdhani vienna main europe kii vijayi shaktiyaan 1815 main ekatrit hui
 The aim was to rearrange the map of Europe that Napoleon had reversed from his wars and victories

 Many small countries of Europe participated in this conference, but in relation to policy making, the role of the representatives of the four main countries was important

 After the defeat of Napoleon, the entire system of busy Europe and various opposing principles organized a conference in Vienna, the capital of Austria in 1815, in order to compromise it is known as the Vienna Congress
 nepolian ne apni vidhwans kaari yudhon se sampurna europe ko dhwast kar diya
 Therefore, this Congress was organized with the aim of crushing his power
