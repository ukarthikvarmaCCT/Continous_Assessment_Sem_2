 He gets that job
 uske pad ko sanbhaalane ke raat ko hi ek suraksha adhikari kii bhi maut ho jaati he or vishnu ko pataa chalata he kii vahaan ko aatma he jo yah hatyaayein kar rahi hai

 He then remembers that his name was Arjun and he lived in an orphanage
 jise mal ke maalik or uske kuch saathiyon ne milakar jala diya tha
 Then all those people also burnt alive and became souls but Arjuna managed to escape from there
 lekin chot ke kaaran apana yaaddaasht kho diya tha
 After his memory, he tells those souls that he has killed all the people involved in the incident at that time

 Along with doing, he also studies the psychosocial side of the person

 prashn jyotish, jyotish ki vah kala he jisase aap apane man kii kaarysiddhi ko jaan sakate he
 The question lagna is seen to know whether an event will occur or not
 prashn jyotish mai udit lagan ke vishay main kaha jaataa he ki lagn me udit raashi ke ansh apana vishesh mahatv rakhte he
 Question: In astrology, every house, every sign has its own special meaning
 jyotish kii is vidha main lagn main udit lagn, prashn karne vaala swayan hota he
 The seventh house makes sense of the subject matter about which the question is asked
 prashn kis vishay se sambandhit haiyah jaanane ke liye jo grah lagn ko purna drushti se dekhtaa he, us grah se judaa prashn ho saktaa he yaa jo grah kundalee mai balavaan ho lagnesh se sambandh banaaye us grah se juda prashn ho saktaa he
 The timing of the question matters a lot in the question chart, so how to determine the time of the question is considered an important topic
 prashn samay nirdhaaran ke vishay main prashn kundalee kaa niyam he ki jab prashnkarta ke man main prashn utpann ho vahi prashn kaa sahi samay he
 For example, the time the questioner called and the time the astrologer gave to the questioner, the time will be taken for both of them at which time the astrologer heard the call, the same question is the time of the horoscope
 prashn kundalee kaa prayog aaj ke samay main or bhi zyada ho gaya he
 It is difficult to see the answers of many questions from the horoscope, while they can be easily seen from the question horoscope
 prashn kundalee se janaa ja saktaa he ki amuk ichha puri hogi yaa nahin
 Questions can also be answered from the questions horoscope, which can be answered in a yes or no, such as whether there will be victory or defeat in such a case, whether the sick person will be healthy or not, whether the person left from home will return or not
 It can also be known from the question chart whether the lost item will be found or not
 prashn jyotish me raashio kaa vargeekaran yahan yah bataata he ki shirishoday rashiyaan prashn ki safalataa bataati he or prishtoday rashiyaan prashn kii asafalataa ki ore ishaara karti he, saamaanya prashnon main lagn main shubh grah kaa hona, acha mana jaataa he or ashubh grah kaa baithna ashubh
lagn ko shubh grah dekhe to prashn ki safalataa ki ore kadam kah sakate he
 Similarly, the Diwali sign indicates auspicious question, while the night sign signifies questions related to inauspicious subjects
 apane prashn ki pushti ke liye prashn ke yoga ko janm kundalee main bhi dekha ja saktaa he jaise-lagn mai char raashi kaa udai hona yah bataata he ki sthiti badalane vaali he or sthir raashi yah bataati he ki jo he vahi bana rahegaa, arthath yatra ke prashn main lagn main char raashi hone par yatra hogi or sthir raashi hone par nahin hogi tathaa dwiswabhaav hone par lagn ke ansho par dhyaan diya jaataa he,00 se 150 tak sthir raashi ke samaan hoga, anyathaa char raashi ke samaan hoga
 prashn ki safalataa is baat par bhi nirbhar karti he, ki lagn, lagnesh, bhav, bhavesh kaa sambandh jitna adhik hoga, kaarysiddhi utani jald hogi
 prashn man ki ichha he, prashnkarta ki joichha he vah prashnkarta ke paksh mai he yaa nahin yah prashnan se dekha jaataa he jaise yatra ke prashn main prashnkarta yatra chahta he or prashn kundalee main bhi yah aata he tabhi kaha jaataa he ki vyakti yatra karegaa, anyathaa nahin
 prashn kundalee main haar jeet kaa prashn ek aisa prashn he jisamen lagn main shubh grah kaa hona ashubh fal detaa he jabaki ashubh athwa krur grah kaa parinaam shubh hota he
 The fact to be considered here is that if the inauspicious planets are sitting in both the ascendant and the seventh house then the fruit is seen from the parts
 tathy yah he ki agar lagn evam saptam bhav donon hi main ashubh grah baithe hon to anshon se fal ko dekha jaataa he
 The number of expressions is 12 in the horoscope
 janm kundalee me prayek bhav sthir he or sabhi kaa apana mahatv he
 With what sense to look in the question chart, it depends on the question
 prashn kundalee me kaaryesh vah he jiske vishay me prashn kiya gaya he jaise- vivaah ke prashn me saptam bhav kaa swami kaaryesh he
 Similarly, in the question of children, the fifth is Kamesh
 prashn kundalee me prashn kii safalataa ke liye bhavesh ore kaaryesh me sambandh dekha jaataa he
 The closer the relationship is between these two, the closer it is to both parts, the better it is considered
 yadi ye dono lagn, lagnesh, chandra or guru se sambandh banaaye to uttar saakaratmak hoga, anyathaa nahi

 The World Wide Web is a system of retrieving interconnected hypertext documents through the Internet
 ek web broujar kii sahaayta se ham un web pannon ko dekh sakate hai jinamein text, chhavi, video, envan anya multimedia hote hai tathaa hiserlink kii sahaayta se un pannon ke bich main avaagaman kar sakate he
 The World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners Lee in 1989 while working at the European Nuclear Research Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, and was released in 1992
 uske baad se barnars-lee nen web ke staron ke vikaas main ek sakriya bhoomika adaa kii he or haal ke varshon main unhonen cementic web viksit karne ke apane swapn kii vakaalat kii he
 Viewing a web page on the World Wide Web usually begins by typing its URL in a web browser or following a hyperlink to that page or resource
 tab us panne ko dhund kar prardashit karne ke liye web broujar andar hi andar sanchaar sandeshon kii ek shrinkhalaa aarambh karata he
 The server-named portion of the URL is first converted to an IP address with the help of a globally distributed Internet database, known as the Domain Name System
 web sarwar se sampark saadhane or data packet bhejne ke liye ye ypi pataa jaruri he
 The browser then requests the resource by sending a request for hypertext transfer protocol to that specific address of the web server
 ek aam web panne kii baat karen to, web broujar sabase pehle us panne ke ech
tii
em
el
 text ke liye anurodh karata he or tunrat hi uskaa padchhed kar detaa he
 The web browser then re-requests images and files that are part of that page
 ek website kii lokapriyata saamanyat: is baat se maapi jaati he ki kitni baar uske pannon ko dekha gaya yaa kitni baar uske sarwar ko hit kiya gaya yaa phir kitni baar uski sanchikaon ke liye anurodh kiya gaya
 After receiving the required files from the web server, the browser displays the page on the screen as instructed by HTML, cascading style sheets and other web languages
 jis web panne ko ham screen par dekhte hai uske nirmaan ke liye anya chhaviyon envan sansadhano kaa bhi istemaal hota he
 Most web pages will include hyperlinks to other pages related to them and perhaps downloadable content, source documents, definitions and other web resources
 is upyogi or sambandhit sansadhano ke samagam ko, jo kii aapas main hypertext link ke dwaara jude hue hon, ko jaankaree kaa "web" kaha gaya
 Tim Berners Lee was first named Worldwide Web in 1990 for making it available on the Internet
 web kii utpatti ke anternihit vichaaron ke lakshan 1980 main milane shuru ho gaye the jab sarn main tim barnars-lee nen ankvaiyar kii rachana kii thi, kii taraf tha jo unhonen bachapan main padhi thi
 Although it was different from the system used today, its original ideas were largely the same)
 march 1989 main tim barnars-lee nen ek prastaav likhaa jisamen ankvaiyar kaa zikr kiya gaya or ek adhik vistrut soochna pranali kaa varnan kiya gaya
 With the help of Robert Calleau, he published a more formal proposal of the World Wide Web on November 12, 1990
 iskaa adarsh namoona EBT ke DYNATEXT SGML reader, jise kii sarn dwaara anubandhit kiya gaya tha, dwaara pradaan kiya gaya tha
 EBT
 haalaanki ye DYNATEXT ke antargat SGML ISO 8879:1986 ke hypermedia main vistaar main iskaa mukhya yogadan tha) pranali kaaphi ucch takanic kii maani jaati thi, parantu ise bahut mahangaa samajha jaataa tha or HEP ke samaaj ke istemaal ke liye jo licencing niti thi use bhi anuchit samajha jaataa tha
 The Next Cube was used by berners-lee in 1990 to write the world's first web server, and the first web browser, the World Wide Web
 1990 ke christmas tak barnars-lee ne ek chaalu web ke liye aavashyak sabhi upkarnon kaa nirmaan kar liya tha:pehla web broujar, pehla web sevak or pratham web prishth jo is pariyojna kaa varnan karte the
 On 6 August 1991, he posted a brief summary of the World Wide Web project on the alt
hypertext newsgroup
 is tithi ko web ke internet par ek saarvajanik rup se uplabdh seva ke shuruyaat ke rup main bhi yaad kiya jaataa he
 The first server outside Europe was built in December 1991 at SLAC
 hypertext jaise mahatvapurn buniyadi vichaar kii utpatti 1960 kii puraani pariyojnaon se hi ho gai thi- ted nelson or andrius wain dame - ted nelson kii pariyojna zanadu or duglas engelbert kii on-line systams 
donon nelson or engelbert ko vannevar bush kii microfils par aadhaarit "memex " se prerana mili thi, jiskaa varnan 1945 ke ek niabandh main is prakaar kiya gaya tha " jaisaa ham sonchen "
 berners-lee's major success was the combination of Hypertext and Internet
 In his book Weaving the Web, he described how he repeatedly suggested to members of the two tech communities that the two technologies combine
 Maybe, but no one accepted his invitation and eventually he had to take a hand in the project
 web or anya jagahon par istemaal hone vaale sansadhano kii vishwa main ekmaatr pahchaan vaali pranali viksit kii: uniform risource abhigyapak
 The web had a lot of differences from other hypertext systems at the time
 web main do dishaao kii kadiyon kii bajaay keval ek disha vaali kadiyon kii aavashyaktaa thi
 If someone wants to join a resource, without the help of the owner of that resource, then it is also possible
 pehle kii pranaaliyon kii tulana main isane web brouzars or sarvaron ko lagu karne main aane vaali dikkaton ko kaaphi had tak kam kar diya
 But this in turn gave rise to a severe problem of link rot
 purvadhikaariyon, jaise kii hyper card, kii tulana main ye web gaiyr malikana tha
 This made it possible to develop servers and clients independently and add other extensions without license restrictions
 30 april 1993 ko sarn ne ghoshnaa kii ki vishwa vyapee web sabake liye nickshulk hoga or koi shulk bakaayaa nahin rahegaa
 With the announcement of the Gopher Protocol that its service is no longer free, the trend of people turned to the web rather than Gopher very quickly
 violawww ek shuruaati lokapriy web browsar tha, jo ki hyper card par aadhaarit tha
 Scholars generally agree that the new turning point in the life of the World Wide Web began in 1993 with the arrival of the Mosaic Web Browser, the development of this graphical browser by a team from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications of the University of Illinois at Urbana Schumpagn
 By Mark Andrissen

 Mosaic became by far the most popular Internet protocol because of its graphical user interface
 vishwa vyapee web sangh ke tim berners-lee dwaara oktober 1994 main europea sanghathan parmaanu anusandhan chhodane ke baad sthapit kiya gaya tha
 It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory of Computer Science with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency support - which started the Internet and the European Commission
 ghar main sthapit vaishvik soochna pranali kaa vichaar ko kam se kam isaac asimov kii march 1959 kii laghu kahani "aneverseri" ameging stories tak peeche khinchaa ja saktaa he
 In this, the characters obtain information through a home computer called a "multivac outlet"
 ye grah computer puure grah par faile circuits ke ek jaal dwaara ek mile lambey super computer se juda hua tha, jo kii prithvi ke andar kahin sthapit tha
 a character is thinking of establishing a multivac, junior model for his children

 Several formal standards and other technical characteristics define the operation of various aspects of the World Wide Web, Internet, and computer information exchange
 kai dastavejon ko vishwa vyapee web sangh ne barnars-lee ke netritv main banaaya he, lekin kuch anya ko internet ejineering task force or anya sanghathanon dwaara banaaya gaya he
 Generally, when web standards are discussed, the following publications are seen as basic: atirikt prakaashan vishwa vyapee web kii anya aavashyak takneekon kii paribhaasha pradaan karte hai, jinamein nimnlikhit shaamil hai: An important advancement in the field of web technology was the Java platform of Sun Microsystems
 isane web pannon ko chote prograamon kaha jaataa he) ko sidhe dikhne main sakasham banaaya
 These applets run on the end user's computer and provide a superior class of experience compared to web pages
 java ke graahakon ke liye jo applates the unhen anekon kaarnon se aashaa ke anuroop lokapriyata hasil nahin hui
 These reasons included the lack of integration with other elements, and the fact that many computers at that time were sent to the end customers without installing a proper Java virtual machine, which caused the user to download
 Applets used to appear

 javascript, on the other hand, was a scripting language initially developed for use within web pages

 In combination with the Web page document object model, javascript has become a highly effective technique, even beyond its original creators' imagination
 ek panne ko uske istemaalkarta tak pahunchane ke baad bhi uske DOM main ched-chhaad karne ko gatisheel HTML kaha gaya, sthir HTML se rujhaan parivartan par jor dene ke liye aisa kiya gaya
 In normal cases, all optional information and tasks that are available on a web page with javascript are downloaded as soon as the page is first accessed
 AJAX antarmishrit web vikaas kii takneekon kaa ek samooh he jiskaa upyog interective web anuprayogon ke vikaas main kiya jaataa he jo kii web panne ke andar anshon ko unnat karne kaa ek tarika pradaan karte hai

 Nearly all web browsers collect recently received data, usually on a local hard drive
 The HTTP request sent by the browser typically only asks for data that has been changed since the last download

 Internet banking and news sites often use this feature
 HTTP 'get' ke saath anurodhit data ke cash ho jane kii sambhaavna hoti he, yadi anya sharten puri hoti hon
 The data received in response to 'POST' is considered to be dependent on the posted data and hence it is not cached

 If no host appears in the typed URL, some web browsers will try to add "www" to the beginning automatically and possibly "

 musalamaanon kii ibaadat gaah ko masjid kehete hai
 It is used for prayers In the early Muslim period, Masjid Nabvi was also used to meet and discuss Ophod from abroad
 masjid se musalamaanon kii pehali vishvavidhyalayon ne bhi janm liya he
 Apart from this, Islamic architecture has also developed mainly from mosques
 shabd masjid kaa shabdic arth he 'pranaam' karne kii jagah
 This word is often used in the languages of Muslims including Urdu
 yah arabi jati shabd he
 The word 'mosque' is used for this in English and European languages, although many Muslims now use mosques in English and other European languages as they think it derives from the Spanish word Mosca Basmjani mosquito
 lekin kuch logon ke vichaar main yah sahi nahin he
 Near Ahle Islam, mosque, that building means samsara namaz party is performed
 agar masjid main namaaz shuukravaar bhi hoti ho to use jama masjid kehete hai
 The word Masjid has also come up in the Quran, as in the reference to Masjid Haram, the word has been used in uncountable imports
 kuch vidwaanon ke vichaar main sabhi masjidon vastav main masjid haraam hi drushtaant hai haalanki baad main bahut shandaar or vibhinn aalanoa style hai nirmaan paidaa hue jisase ek alag islamic vaastukala ne janm liya
 Overall, India is the only non-islamic country in the world with the largest number of three lakh mosques
 itani masjid sansar ke kisi bhi desh yaa islamic mulkon tak main nahin he
 The first mosque was the Kaaba
 kaaba ke aasapaas masjid haraam kaa nirmaan hua
 According to one tradition, the Kaaba is the place where the first-ever Hazrat Adam Alaihissalam and Hazrat Eve Alaihissalam recited Namaz on the ground
 isi jagah par hazarat ibrahim alaihissalam ne hazarat ismail alaihissalam ke saath ek masajid nirmaan qi
 This place was called Masjid al-haram
 kai paramparaon ke anusaar yaheen hazarat mohammad sa0va a0va0 ne pehle pahal prarthana adaa kin
 The second mosque was the 'masjid Kabaye', whose foundation was laid out by Hazrat Mohammed's equipment and some of the slim Medina when he was on his way to Mecca Hijrat from Mecca
 teesri masjid, masjide nabavi' thi jisaki neenv bhi hazarat mohammad sa upkaran or slim ne madeene main hizrat ke baad rakhi or nirmaan main swayan bhaag liya
 The mosque was the religious, social and political center of Nabvi Muslims
 aaj masjid haraam or masjide nabavi musalamaanon kii pavitra sabase sthaan hai
 Mosques were built with the spread of Islam outside the Arab world
 unamem se kuch masjid teraa sau saal puraane hai
 The mosque was built with the victory of Egypt in 640 A
D
 baad main vahaan jamiya aalazehar jaisi masjid nirmaan huin
 Egypt itself later became an Arab region

 Mosques were built in Spain with the victory of Spain, of which the mosque is famous as Kartabah Archaeological
 spain ke musalamaanon ke haath se nikalne ke baad europea sanyukt ne bahut sankeern vahaan islam ke asaar mitaane kii bharpoor koshish kii
 All mosques were either demolished or converted into kitaun
 Prayer has never been allowed in Masjid Kartabah since that time
 europe ke adhikansh vartmaan masjidon aadhunik daur main bani hai haalanki albania, romania, cyprus or bosnia main kuch puraani masjidon hai
 The mosque in Cyprus is an example of Lala Singh Pasha
 bosnia or harabhagavoina kai pracheen masjidon ko 1990 ke dashak main nasht kar diya gaya he
 Much of the mosques were built after the Turkish influence in Europe
 europe main solahavin shatabdi main banane vaali masjidon kuch udhaaharan hai: The mosque to be built in the eighteenth century includes the mosque Adham Bay 'of Tera, Albania
 unnisvin or beesvin sadi main europe main anginat masjidon kaa nirmaan hua jo mukhya kaaran europe kaa musalmaan desh par kabja or falswaroop par musalamaanon or unka mail jol or musalamaanon kii pashchimi deshon kii taraf hizrat hai
 Large magnificent mosques were built in the twentieth century, with architectural alliances
 yah na keval musalmaan deshon nirmaan hui he balki europea deshon main bhi shumaar masjidon kaa nirmaan hua he
 Examples of these mosques are Beit Alamkaram of Dhaka, Sultan Omar Ali Saif Aladdin Mosque of Baronai Darlasalam Mosque of Indonesia, Ajyakalal in Japan, First Mosque in Japan, Masjid Kobe 'shah Faisal Mosque in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, Mosque Alazhab of Manila, Almasjad Alajyakam of Singapore ۃ , The Islamic Center in the US, Washington and countless other mosques
 masjidon musalamaanon kaa dharmik centre he
 It mainly organizes the Namaz Party which includes Panasthana Prayer, Prayer Friday and Eid Prayer
 iske alaava bina kaaryon bhi hote hai
 Once upon a time mosques were also used for donation and distribution of zakۃ, which is now less practiced
 masjiden aksar quran kii shiksha ke liye ek centre kaa kaam karti hai
 Madrasas are also maintained in many mosques which are given the responsibility of religious education
 masjidon musalamaanon kaa centre he jiskaa uddeshy keval dharmik nahin balki musalamaanon kaa saamaajik, shaikshanik or raajnneetik centre masjiden rahi hai
 Bazamat prayers play a very important role in the relationship, reconciliation and status tracking of Muslims
 is ke alaava masjidon yudhon or anya apatkaaleen sthitiyon main ek panaahagaah kaa kaam karti rahi hai
 It has not only been for Muslims but also for giving shelter to non-muslims, like the mosque Paris has been a refuge for Jews during World War II
 masjidon vah jagah hai jahaan se pehali vishvavidhyalayon ne janm liya jaise jamiya aalazehar, jamiya karviin, jamiya zayatonia aadi
 Madrasas are installed in most of the mosques wherein the education of the Quran and religion has been given as well as the present primary education
 purvi deshon ke gaanvon main kai masjidon main saamaanya madrason bhi kaayam hai
 Some mosques have Islamic centers where research centers are established, along with Dini and Daniyawi education
 masjidon kaa raajnneetik charitra bhi aitihaasik taur par shuru se jari he
 Masjid Nabvi was not just for namaz but it also met Ophod coming from abroad during the period of Hazrat Muhammad sa Tools and Slim
 vibhinn gazoaat or saraaya yojana bahes laae gaye
 Revolutionary movements took place in mosques for centuries as they have been an important source of contact with Muslims
 aadhunik daur main bhi masjidon kii raajnneetik bhoomika kii andekhi nahin kar saktaa jo spasht udhaaharan laal masjid islamabad kii he
 Governments have also been using Daran for mosques and mosques for their own purposes
 praarambhik masjidon bahut saral thi or manjila saadhaaran imaarat bhi shaamil hoti thi jiske saath koi minar yaa gumbad aavashyak nahin tha
 In Islam, there is only a special place for a mosque, but not its architecture
 shuruyaat masjide nabavi khajur ke tanon ke stambhon or paton kii chat se nirmaan hua tha
 The Kaaba was a square building made of stone around which worship was done in the open premises
 lekin samay ke saath musalamaanon sansaadhan padhate chale gaye or unhone apni jarurat or kshetra kii samskruti ke anusaar masjid nirmaan kii
 Expensive works in mosques and lofty towers and domes began to be built later
 minar ke kaaran yah tha ki masjid dur se dikhaai, is par chadhakar azaan di awaz dur tak aae or kshetra kii samskruti or kala kii jhalak thi
 From the dome the voice of the speech and prayer of the mosque speaker was spread throughout the mosque with an echo and beauty
 islam chunki jivit chizon kii tasviren protsaahit nahin isliye masjid kii tazain ke liye quran aayaat kaa vibhinn sundar tareeke se istemaal kiya gaya or vibhinn jaumitrek dizin bhi kiye gaye
 Due to the glimpses of time, necessity and culture, many things in the mosque became almost essential such as minarets, domes, a courtyard in the mosque, wuzu fountains, halls for namaz etc
 iske alaava aksar masjid ke hamaam, pustaken box, mb or kuch masjidon ke saath madrason, anusandhan kendra yaa niyamit vishvavidhyalayon shaamil hai
 The minaret is the main hallmark of the mosque which the mosque can be seen from a distance
 mukhya rup se minar par chadhakar azaan di jaati thi jisase awaz dur tak jaati thi lekin ab azaan masjid ke bheetar se kiya jaataa he kyonki lavad spikar se awaz ko dur dur tak pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 Not tall at the height of the mosque tower
 yah bahut chota bhi ho saktaa he or bahut ooncha bhi
 Small mosques in Europe do not have towers because they often have one or two rooms
 sabase lanbaa minar masjid hasan samiksha, kasabalanka, morocco kaa samajha jaataa he jo 210 meter ooncha he
 Initially the mosque did not have minarets and they were very simple but soon the minarets became almost part of the mosque
 musalamaanon par aarope lagaaya he ki minar kitaoon ke minar dekhakar banaae gaye lekin yah sahi nahin he kyonki arab nirmaan main pehle hi se minar banate the khaskar vibhinn raksha kilon ke saath minar dur tak dekhne ke liye banaae jate the
 Menars range from one to six in mosques
 aksar masjidon main chaar minar milte hai
 Many mosques in Turkey have six towers
 masjidul haraam main kul nau minar hai jo vibhinn samay nirmaan hue hai
 The mosque houses ten minarets of Nabvi, of which six are 99 meters high
 ۔ rajya masjid lahore, pakistan ke minar 53
8 meter lambey hai
 There are two hundred and four stairs to the top of the tower
 masjid alhazar, tareem, yaman ke minar kii lambaai 53 meter he
 Masjid Hassan Review Tower, State Mosque Tower and Masjid Alhazar Tower are some of the longest menars in the world
 menaron kii prakaar vibhinn deshon main alag hai
 In Pakistan, India and Iran, the towers are usually round and thick
 turki main lagbhag minar gol par kam motaai vaale hote hai
 Many minaret thieves occur in Sham and Egypt
 misr main hashat pahalu minar bhi milte hai
 But other types of minarets are also found in all these above countries
 menaron ke upar laal, firoz yaa anya pad va nigaar bhi banaae jate hai jo unki khubsuurati bad jaataa he
 Some minarets in Iran and Iraq are made of golden color, on the top of which there has been a rough investment made of real gold
 gumbad aajkal kii masjidon kaa lagbhag hissaa anivaary hai
 The main purpose of the dome is not just beauty but it makes the voice of the speaker mosque resonate throughout the mosque
 iske alaava ab gumbad masjidon kii pahchaan ban chuki he
 Hazrat Mohammed Sallallahu Alaihi and equipment and slimness is in the Mubarak Mosque Nabvi which is very famous green dome
 rauza mubarak kii tasviren sabase pramukh yahi gumbad he
 Movement independence in Palestine is also the hallmark of independence independence Palestine when located in Haram Ghodsi Alsharif
 yah musalamaanon kaa shaayad sabase purana sthapit gumbad he
 Some people consider him a mosque, which is wrong
 iran main masjid bahut khubasurat gumbad nirmaan hue hai
 Such as Masjid Imam, Isfahan's dome or mosque agencies Shad, Mashhad's dome
 The subcontinent Pak and the Indian dome are also competent deed
 sindh main arabon ke aagaman ke baad kai masjidon nirmaan hui jinke saath saral lekin bade gumbad the magar baad main mughal baadshahon ne badi shandaar masjidon nirmaan kin jaise rajya masjid lahore, pakistan ke safed gumbad bahut hi sundar or bade hai
 The domes of the Babri Masjid built in the desert were also very large, which were martyred by Hindu terrorists
 aadhunik daur main nirmaan hone karachi, pakistan kii masjidobi kaa gumbad ek gumbad masjidon main sabase bada he jo 72 meter vyas kaa he or bina kisi stambh ke nirmaan hua he
 The Salimaya Mosque Adarna, Turkey's dome, built in 1557 AD, is 27
2 meters in diameter and is also one of the world's largest gunfights
 yah gumbad purana hone ke baavjood itnaa majboot he ki 1915 i
 kii balgaria kii topon kii bambaari se bhi nahin tutaa or keval aantarik parat ko nuksaan pahunchaa
 The largest gunfights in the world also include the dome of Masjid Sultan Salahuddin Aziz, Malaysia, which is 170 feet in diameter
 yaad rahe ki gumbad keval masjidon par nahin hote balki america, vishvavidhyalayon or kuch jaanch kendron par bhi dekhe ja sakate hai
 There is also a beautiful sculpture on the interior of gunbeds and Quranic imports are often written
 kuch ganabadon main shishe lage hote hai jisase roshni andar sakati he
 Most of the interior sculpture of the dome is done in dark blue, Firozabad or red as these colors can be seen by people standing under the dome in high gunbeds
 pracheen masjidon ke bade angan hai jaise masjid haraam or masjide nabavi ke angan bahut bade hai jinamein samay ke saath vistaar aayaa he
 Millions of people can undoubtedly offer prayers in these tolerance
 lahore kii rajya masjid kaa angan bhi bahut bada he jisamen ek samay main ek lakh ke kareeb log namaaz pard sakate hai
 Apart from the namaz, there were sure to be mosques in the old-time mosques for wuzu
 kuch talab aise bane hote the jinamein barish pani nather kar jaataa tha
 An example of this is Jama Alakeroan Alakbar, the ancient mosque of Tayunas
 bade sahanon or unke bich hoje ek or udhaaharan jama masjid isiahaan, iran he
 The courtyard of the Sultan Mosque Burujardi, Iran is also very large, with three buildings surrounding it
 samarkand main amir timore banaae hue masjid bibisi kanam kaa angan bhi bade sahanon suchi main shaamil hai
 Jamia Alazhar and Egypt itself are very large courtyards of a mosque
 uddeshy yah suchi bahut lambii he
 There are hoses in all tolerance and some have fountains
 kuch masjidon jaise masjid paris ke hamaam bhi hai
 The mosque usually has a large room or hall special for prayers, which does not have much equipment but beautiful and comfortable carpets are laid out so that more and more people can easily offer prayers
 isamen aamtaur mehrab or mimber bhi hote hai
 In the arch that is the place, the Imam provides the namaz party and the speaker gives a speech on Mimbar
 mimber aamtaur lakdi ke banaae jate the
 The oldest wooden mimber is in the extensive Alcaroan highlands, Tayunas, which belong to the first century Hijri
