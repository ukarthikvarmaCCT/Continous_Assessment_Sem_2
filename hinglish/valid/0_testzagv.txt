 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system
 rajtantr kii nirankushta samaapt hui or loktantric vaataavarna main logon ne chaiyn kii saans lee
 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France
 europea desh ke kisaan abhi udaasi kii sthiti main the
 But the French peasants had become independent
 unke paas apni jameen apana makaan itani suvidha ke baavjud samant kar evam samant sevaaon kaa ant nahin hua tha unhen apni aamadani kaa bahut bada hissaa samant kar ke rup main chukaana padataa tha
 And still his position is good
 ve paise bachaakar kuch na- kuch jameen kharid liya karte the jameen kharidne kii bhukh nirantar badhati ja rahi thi isamen samant kar va berogari baadhak the at: ve samant peshon ko hataane kii baat soch rahe the at: madhyam varg ke netritv main unhe bal mila or 1789 i
 main unhone vidroh kar diya
 Lack of tradition of liberal autocracy in France- anya europea deshon main bhi nirankush rajtantr tha
 But the emperors there had reduced their autocracy over time
 prasha kaa raja fredirak apane samay kaa mahaan prabud prashaasak tha
 Other countries of Europe followed by Russia, Italy, Spain etc
 unhone samaynusaar jaataa kii aarthik bhautik tathaa anya kshetron main unnat karne kaa yatha sambhav prayaas kiya
 But France lacked such liberal autocracy
 vahaan ke raja janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe the
 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 Awareness of medium france main hi sarvapratham kranti hone kaa kaaran vahaan kaa madhyamvarg tha
 Other countries also had a middle class but they were not as cultural, rich and educated as in France
 unamem shakti kaa abhaav tha
 They could not think of rebelling against the king
 france main madhyam varg ke log anek kaaran se apane samraaton se asantusht the
 And for his own defense, Raj was desperate to curb power
 anya europea rajyon main is tarah kii sthiti kaa abhaav tha
 There was no one to lead in other countries, there was a ready middle class in France
 at: sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Usefulness of noble class kuleen vahg ko pahase visheshadhikaar is liye diya gaya tha ki ve shashan chalaane main raja kii madad kare
 And they also used to protect Janata
 parantu dhire – 2 yah kaary raja ke karmchaaree karne laga
 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended
 phir bhi iske visheshadhikaar main kisi prakaar kii katautee nahin kii gai
 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility
 darshanikon kaa prabhaav- In the 18th century, there was a chaotic movement throughout Europe
 darshanik, vichaarak, vaagyanik sabhi deshon main viddhman the
 But the main among them were the French thinkers
 jinhone kranti kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar prastut kiya
 He drew the attention of the people to the evils in the society and gave a voice to the people
 is tarah kaa prayaas anya deshon main nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 France was the only field of thinkers like Montague, Voltaire Russo
 austria, prasha or rus main is tarah ke vichaarak nahin the
 In other countries of Europe, there was no class of philosophers who gave their real status and created satisfaction in them
 france main hi kranti hone kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Lack of political participation england main jab madhyam varg ne jaagarukta ai to use desh kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar diya gaya
 But this was not the case with France
 france kaa madhyam varg apane samraaton se kaaphi asantusht tha
 They were expected
 shikshit hone ke baavjood unhen kulinon kii tarah pratishtha uplabdh nahin thi
 They were not given the opportunity to participate in French politics
 isliye unhone asantusht hokar kranti kaa naaraa buland kiya
 Ineligible king and corruption in administration- france kii rajanithik vyavastha kendrikrut thi lekin raja ayogy the
 The administration was dominated by corruption
 europe ke anya deshon main nirankush shashan totha parantu raja yogya the or shashan par unka purn niyantran tha
 The middle class of France was feeling this administrative corruption
 tathaa isliye vah vidroh karne ke liye taiyaar tha
 Rise of national spirit is samay europe main teji se rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai hone laga
 France was the only country in entire Europe where there was a complete lack of a national spirit
 iske chalate bhi sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Effect of American freedom struggle- 1766 i
 main american swatantraaa sangram prarambh hua
 The American people revolted against England
 france ke sainikon ko bhi is swatantraaa sangram main bhaag lene kaa avasar mila at: unhone yah mahasus kiya ki yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa prapti kii ja sakati he
 He also realized that freedom is possible only through freedom
 france lautne par unhone dekha kii jis swatantraaa ko liye unhonen america main yuddh kiya usee swatantraaa kaa france main purnat: abhaav he
 Hence, he became restless for the revolution here and tried to get freedom through war
 europe ke anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 Superiority of French Civilization france main hi kranti hone kaa ek vishisht kaaran yah tha ki yahan kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe rashtron kii apeksha adhik samrudh or vaibhav purna thi
 Even in terms of governance, the rule of France was highly organized
 france sampoorn europe sabhyataa or saanskriti kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Paris is considered the largest center of literature and thought in all of Europe
 france janamat anya europe rajyon kii apeksha adhik jaagrit or aalochanatmak tha
 As a result of all these reasons, in 1789 AD, there was revolution in France and not in other European states

 hamen apana rasta swayan bananaa hoga or swayan


 raajnneetik shakti shoshito kii samasyaon kaa nivaaran nahin ho sakati, unka uddhaar samaaj me unka uchit sthaan paane main nihit he
 They have to change their bad way of living 


 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii

 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya

 isamen unhone muslim lig kii musalamaanon ke liye ek alag desh pakistan kii maang kii aalochana kii

 unhone prastaavit kiya ki muslim or gaiyr-muslim bahumat vaale hisson ko alag karne ke liye punjab or bengal kii prantiy simaaon ko phir se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi

 ek maanav se hin samajha gaya or jiskaa sparsh maatr pradooshan failaane kaa paryaapt kaaran he? Ambedkar was also a great critic of the practices of Islam in South Asia
 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims
 unhone likhaa ki muslim samaaj me to hindu samaaj se bhi kahi adhik saamaajik buraaiyaan he or musalmaan unhen " bhaichaare " jaise naram shabdon ke prayog se chhupate hai
 He also criticized the oppressive curtain practice of oppression of women in Muslim society as well as the discrimination against the Arzal classes by Muslims who were considered "lower class"
 unhone kaha haalaanki pardaa hinduon me bhi hota he par use dharmik manyata keval musalamaanon ne di he
 He criticized bigotry in Islam due to which the society has become very fanatical due to the lack of literate adherence to the laws of Islam and it is very difficult to change it
 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted
 ambedkar buddha dharm ko pasand karte the kyonki usamen teen siddhanton kaa samanvit rup miltaa he jo kisi anya dharm main nahin miltaa
 Buddhism teaches wisdom, compassion and equity
 unka kahana tha ki manushya inhen baton ko shubh tathaa aanandit jivan ke liye chahta he
 God and soul cannot save society
 ambedkar ke anusaar sachcha dharm wo hi he jiskaa kendra manushya tathaa naitikta ho, vigyaan athwa bauddhik tatv par aadhaarit ho, na ki dharm kaa kendra ishwar, aatma kii mukti or moksh
 At the same time, he said that the work of religion should be to rebuild the world and not to explain its origin and end
 vah janatantric samaaj vyavastha ke pakshdhar the, kyonki unka maananaa tha aisi sthiti main dharm maanav jivan kaa maardarshak ban saktaa he
 He got all these things in the only Buddhism
 gandhi va congress kii katu aalochana ke baavjood ambedkar kii pratishtha ek adwitiya vidwaan or vidhivetta kii thi jiske kaaran jab, 15 agast 1947 main bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad, congress ke netritv vaali nai sarkaar astitv main ai to usne ambedkar ko desh ke pehle kaanoon evam nyaay mantri ke rup main seva karne ke liye aamantrit kiya, jise unhone sweekaar kar liya
 On 29 August 1947, Ambedkar was appointed to the post of Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution for the creation of the new Constitution of independent India
 is kaary main ambedkar kaa shuruaati buddha sangh ritiyon or anya buddha granthon kaa adhyayan bhi kaam aayaa
 Granville Austin described the Indian Constitution prepared by Ambedkar as 'the first and most important social document'
 'bharat ke adhikansh sanvaidhanik praavdhaan yaa to saamaajik kranti ke uddeshy ko aage badhaane yaa isaki uplabdhi ke liye jaruri sthitiyon kii sthapana karke is kranti ko badhaava dene ke prayaas main sidhe pahunche hai
 ' ambedkar dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye samvidhan ke paath main vyaktigat nagarikon ke liye naagarik swatantraaa kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa ke liye sanvaidhanik guarantee or suraksha pradaan kii gai he, jisamen dharm kii aazaadee, chuaachhut ko khatm karnaa, or bhedbhaav ke sabhi roopon kaa ulanghan karnaa shaamil he
 Ambedkar argued for comprehensive economic and social rights for women, and won the support of the assembly to introduce the system of reservation of jobs in civil services, schools and colleges for members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, Which was affirmative action
 bharat ke saansadon ne in upayon ke madhyam se bharat kii niraashajanak kakshaon ke liye saamaajik-aarthik asamantaaon or avasaron kii kami ko khatm karne kii ummid kii
 The constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949
 apane kaam ko puraa karne ke baad, bolte hue, ambedkar ne kaha: i feel that the constitution is practicable, it is flexible but it is also strong enough to keep the country united during both peace and war
 vastav main, main kah saktaa hoon ki agar kabhi kuch galat hua to iskaa kaaran yah nahi hoga ki hamaara samvidhan kharaab tha balki iskaa upyog karne vaala manushya adham tha
 Ambedkar opposed Article 370 of the Constitution of India , which gave special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and which was included in the constitution against his wishes
 balraj madhok ne kaha tha ki, ambedkar ne kashmiri netaa shaikh abdulla ko spasht rup se bataaya tha: "aap chaahate hai ki bharat ko aapaki simaaon kii raksha kerani chahie, use aapke kshetra main sadakon kaa nirmaan karnaa chahie, use aapako anaaj kii aapurti kerani chahie, or kashmir ko bharat ke samaan darja dena chahie
 But the Indian government should have only limited powers and the Indian people should not have any rights in Kashmir
 is prastaav ko sahmati dene ke liye, main bharat ke kanoon mantri ke rup main bharat ke hiton ke khilaaf ek vishwasghaatee baat hongi, yah kabhi nahin karegaa
 "then Abdullah approached Nehru, who directed him to Gopal Swami Iyengar, who in turn approached Vallabhbhai Patel and said that Nehru had promised Ske
 abdulla vishesh sthiti
 The passage was passed by Patel while Nehru was on a foreign tour

 According to the Puranas, Bimbisara has been called 'kshrenik'
 bimbisar ne magadh ke yash or sammaan ko vaivaahik sandhiyon or vijayon ke madhyam se kaaphi badhaaya
 One of her queens was the sister of 'prasenjit', the king of Kosala, and she got a village of 1 lakh revenue as a dowry
 uski duusari rani 'chellana' thi, jo ki vaishali ke raja chetak kii putree thi
 Apart from these, two other queens of Bimbisara are also mentioned
 ek or ganika amrapali kaa naam jain saahitiyon main miltaa he
 Bimbisara defeated Brahmadatta and conquered the Anga kingdom
 bimbisar ke rajya main 80,000 gaanv the
 His administration was very good, subjects were happy in his kingdom
 vah apane karmchaariyon par kadi najar rakhata tha
 His high officials used to be called 'rajabhatta' and were placed in four categories - 'sambanthakas' looked after the common tasks, 'senanayaks' saw the work of the army, 'vocational' judicial work and 'mahamatta' produced and assembled
 bimbisar gautam buddha kaa samakalin tathaa buddha se kai baar isaki bhent hui thi, buddha se prabhavit hokar usne buddha dharm apana liya
 In both Jain and Buddhist literature, Bimbisara is described as a follower of his religion
 buddha granth 'vinayapitak' ke anusaar, bimbisar ne apane putr ajatshatru ko yuvaraj ghoshit kar diya tha parantu ajatshatru ne jald rajya paane kii kaamana main bimbisar kaa vadh kar diya
 He was incited by Buddha's cousin 'devadatta' to do such an act and hatched many conspiracies
 jainiyon ke granth 'aavashyak sutara' ke anusaar, jald rajya paane kii chaah main ajatshatru ne apane pita bimbisar ko kaid kar liya, jahaan rani chellana ne bimbisar kii dekharekh kii
 Later, when Ajatshatru finds out that his father loves him very much and has appointed him crown prince, Ajatashatru takes an iron stick and cuts Bimbisara's beds, but Bimbisara consumes the poison in anticipation of a disgrace

 rajya ke niti nirdeshak tatv janatantric sanvaidhanik vikaas ke naveenatam tatv hai
 They were first introduced in the constitution of Ireland

 The task of these elements is to establish a public welfare state

 Parts 3 and 4 of the Indian constitution together are called the soul and consciousness of the constitution, these elements contain the real elements of the constitution and the philosophy of social justice

 The Supreme Court accepted the first part of Article 31 as valid but rejected the second part on the ground that it takes away the revision power of the judiciary which is part of the basic structure of the Constitution

 The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution Amendment Act 1976 31C states that in accordance with the amended 31C, if states enact a law that gives effect to any policy directive element, they cannot declare it unconstitutional on the basis of Article 14 , In violation of 19,31, she cannot get a challenge in the court of law

 prerani motor prayavarti dhara se chalane vaali motor he jiske roter kii koniya chaal stater vinding dwaara paidaa kiye gayi ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii koniya chaal se kam hoti he
 For this reason this motor is called asynchronous motor
 ise 'preran motor' is kaaran kaha jaataa he kyonki iske roter main preran ke dwaara dhara utpann hoti he kyonki roter tathaa ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii chaal alag-alag hoti he
 This motor is most commonly used due to which it is called the workhorse of industries
 isamen ghisne vaala koi avyav nahin he jisase yah bina marammat ke bahut dino tak chal saktaa he
 It is of many types- gharon main saamaanya kaaryon evam kam shakti ke liye prayukt adhikansh motaren ek-feji preran motor hi hotin hai inhen fractional horshpawar motor bhi kehete hai
 For example wings, motors for washing machines, etc
 prayavarti dhara motaron main bhi disht dhara motaron kii bhanti hi kshetrakundaliyaan tathaa armechar hote hai, parantu kuch vibhinn rup main
 They consist of two main parts: one is the stator, which remains fixed and the other rotor which rotates
 prayavarti dhara motaren bhi vibhinn prarupon ke hote hai
 The most-common alternating current motor is the induction motor, which operates on the principle of induction
 preran motaron main stater kundalan trikla sambharan se sambhddha hota he, jiske kaaran ek ghurni chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he
 The conductors of the rotor can also be in the form of triangular coils, which are short-circuited by copper rings at both ends
 aisi rachana vastut:, gilahari ke pinjre kii bhanti hoti he
 Hence, such motors are commonly called 'squirrel Panzer Induction Motor', or 'panjar Motor' only
 ye motor banaavat main bahut sudrudh hote hai tathaa saath hi saath saral tathaa saste bhi hote hai
 Their efficiency is also higher than other motors of the same size
 atev in motaron kaa prayog praaia: saarvatrik he
 But the operation of these motors is, in a way, determined by the design of the rotor and cannot be changed as per the requirement
 inkaa aarambhik balaghurna bahut kam hota he, jise sudhaarney ke liye roter paripath main kuch pratirodh nivisht karnaa aavashyak hota he, parantu sthir praroop kii rachana ke kaaran aisa sambhav nahin ho paata
 Also, the resistance of the rotor drivers cannot be increased permanently, as the loss will increase more and the efficiency of the motor will decrease
 adhik aarambhik, balaghurna praapt karne ke liye dwipanjar motor prayukt kiye jate hai, jinamein ek ke sthaan par do panjar hote hai
 Depending on the type and position of the rotor grooves, some variation in operating characteristics can be achieved and they can be qualified for a variety of purposes
 kisi asi motor kii tulykaalik chaal n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} se aashay uske stater ke ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii chaal se he
 Its value can be derived from the following formula- jahaan f { \ displaystyle f} motor kii supplai kii aavriti tathaa p { \ displaystyle p} chumbakeey dhruvon kii sankhya he udhaaharan ke liye, 50 hertz kii supplai tathaa, 6 pole vaale teen-feji motor ke liye p { \ displaystyle p} = 6 tathaa n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} = 1,000 RPM Slip s { \ displaystyle s} is often defined as follows- jahaan n s { \ displaystyle n_{s}} sincronas speed, n r { \ displaystyle n_{r}} roter kii chaal yadi roter sincronas chaal se gum rahi ho to slip kaa maan shunya hoga, yadi roter bilkul na chal rahi ho to slip kaa maan 1 hoga
 The value of the fault generated by the motor depends on the slip of its rotor
 jisko 'slip-tork vaishishty' kaha jaataa he
 It is clear that induction motors run at 'almost' constant speed
 bhaar ke saath unka chaal vicharan bahut kam hota he
 Therefore, loads that require steady movement are very useful there
 parantu jahaan vicharanshil chaal kii aavashyaktaa ho, vahaan panjar motor saamanyat: prayukt nahin kiye jate
 Their speed is slightly less than synchronous speed, which depends on the pole number and frequency
 at: chaal vicharan karne ke liye yaa to dhruv sankhya main parivartan karnaa aavashyak he, athwa aavriti kaa hi vicharan karnaa aavashyak he
 Frequency variance refers to arranging a separate supply whose frequency can be changed
 iske liye aajkal char aavriti drive aa rahe hai
 The pole number can be changed to a specific ratio by changing the connection of the coil, such as it is possible to convert a 4 polar motor to an 8 polar or 6 polar motor
 is prakaar in dhruv sankhyaon ke tatsambandhi veg bhi praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 The synchronous speed of 4 polar motor at 1,500 cyclic frequency is 1,500 RPM and that of 6 polar and 8 polar are 1,000 and 750 RPM respectively
 is tarah aisi motor kii dhruv sankhya main parivartan kar, inaki tatsambandhi chaal praapt kii ja sakati he
 But these can only happen in two or three sequences
 is vidhi se vistrut paraas main chaal vicharan praapt karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Another method of gait variance in certain sequences is called "sopanipat control"
 yah vidhi belan milon main adhiktar prayukt kii jaati he
 Different types of machine tools also require variable speed, but in general, the variance is done by changing the gear order

 Prakrit is the common name of many regional languages which developed in the medieval era of the Indian Aryabhasha, and all the texts written in those languages are called Prakrit literature
 vikaas kii drushti se bhashavaigyanikon ne bharat main aryabhasha ke teen str niyat kiye hai - pracheen, madhyakaalin or arvachin
 The languages of ancient level are Vedic Sanskrit and Sanskrit, whose development period is supposedly BC
 From 2000 BC Up to 600 are considered
 madhyayugin bhashaayen hai - magadhi, ardhamagadhi, shauraseni, pashachi bhashaa, maharashtri or apbhransh
 Their development is found as early as 600 AD to 1000 AD

 The following characteristics are found mainly in the said medieval languages from ancient languages: sanskrit ke swaron main ri, lri, evam i or ou kaa madhyayugin bhashaaon main abhaav he
 These languages have their own specialty using a and O's passive quantities

 Grammatically, dialects are not found in the forms of nouns and verbs

 Hesitancy is found in forms of causation

 Much of their work is often run with participles

 Varyukhi etc
 of Prakrit, assuming the nature of Prakrit languages as Sanskrit, derived the word Prakrit from it
 "prakruti: sanskritan, tatrabhavan tat aagtan vaa prakritam"
 But the present form of the Sanskrit language itself has developed around the pre-sixth century AD and its stable form was found by Panini
 The third is given in the fourth century

 main hi utpann hona kaise sambhav ho saktaa he ? iske atirikt praakrit main aise bhi anek shabd paae jate hai jinka sanskrit main abhaav he, kintu vaidic bhashaa main ve vidyaman hai
 Many of the words with many of Prakrit's tendencies are found in the Vedas, which are not compatible with Sanskrit grammar
 is samasya par anek paashchaatya vidwaanon kaa ek mat yah he ki aryabhasha jab bharatvarsh main prachlit hui, anarya log uskaa aaryo ke sadrush shuddh shuddh uccharan or prayog nahin kar paae; atev unhone apane nijee uccharan evam bhashastyli ke anusaar use bolnaa prarambh kiya or unke sampark se is kaa prabhaav aaryo par bhi padaa
 Due to this, the instincts of Prakrit language developed
 is mat ke samarthan main yah baat bhi dhyaan dene yogya he ki vaidic kaal se hi jo t th aadi murdhanya dhvaniyon kaa pravesh aryabhasha main hua, vah bahulata se us kaal kii anarya bhashaaon kaa hi prabhaav tha
 But by analyzing the ancient non-aryan languages, it cannot be proved that the seeds of the above characteristics of Prakrit were present in those non-aryan languages
 isiliye is mat ke sambandh main vivaad he
 The second view is that there were phonetic distinctions among the castes that spoke the language of the Vedas, some evidence of which is present in the Vedas itself
 Presumably, the language of the Vedas evolved from the hierarchy of the orthodox Vedas of that period, presumably in several thousand years
 But the specially educated priestly class had its own language, and in which it was used only in religious works
 utane hi kaal pracheenatam vaidic bhashaa kii samakaleen jansadharan kii lokbhasha se sanskrit ke saath saath hi praakrit kaa bhi vikaas hua, jisamen pradeshbhedanusaar naanaa bhed the
 It is also worth noting in this regard that the entry of Aryans in India cannot be said to have taken place at the same time and in one stream
 yadi aage peeche aanevaali arya jatiyon ke bhashabhed se praakrit bhashaaon ke udgam or vikaas va sambandh ho to aashcharya nahin
 In this connection, the opinion of Hornley and Grierson is also notable according to which the Indian Aryan languages are found divided into two classes, one external and the other two in the north, west, south and east languages
 ise sankshep main samajhane ke liye maharashtra pradesh ke naamon jaise gokhale, kher, paranjape, padhye, munje godwole, tambe, tathaa lanka main prachlit naamon jaise gunatilake sena naike, bandarnayak aadi main jo acarant karta ek vachan ke rup se e pratyay dikhaai detaa he, vahi purv kii magadhi praakrit me apane niyamit sthirataa ko praapt hua paaya jaataa he
 In the Adi Aryabhasha, the pronunciation of l has been considered in place of Vedic, like Kulu u srotra
 usee pravriti ke falswaroop vaidic vrik ke sthaan par german bhashasmooh main vulf evam greek main pruthu kaa plutus paaya jaataa he
 These are replaced by the pronunciation of l in the place of sound, but their symmetrical forms like Otta atta, satta are also found in dialects of the same period

 There is a tendency among them to combine combined characters by voice
 varun devtaa kaa naam "uruvan" rup main ullikhit he jisamen swar ke agragam tathaa varnavyatyay kii pravriti spasht dikhaai detii he
 These trends are common symptoms of Prakrit
 pali main prayukt idh sanskrit tathaa vaidic ke ih se purvakaleen parampara kaa he isamen bhi kisi ko koi andeh nahin he
 In the Arya language, the forms of a and o were Hrasva; Ai and Au were lacking; But mixed vowels like ai, au were prevalent; Resonant touches were hesitant; Of the three heats, there was only one
 ye dhvanyatmak visheshtaayen pradhanat: shauraseni praakrit main surakshit pai jaati hai, ityadi
 The harmony of these traits can be properly resolved by assuming that their arrival in the Prakrit languages has been carried on by dialects of the earliest Aryan castes, a tradition unconstrained
 yatharthat: sanskrit ho athwa vaidic ko hi praakrit kii prakruti maan lene se ukt lakshanon kaa koi samaadhaan nahin hota
 Then why did the grammar of Prakrit call Sanskrit the nature of Prakrit? The reason for this is clearly understood by paying attention to the time and form of the grammar of those grammars
 ve vyakaran us kaal main likhe gaye jab vidvatsamaj main praakrit kii apeksha sanskrit kaa adhik prachaar or sammaan tha
 They have also been written in Sanskrit language and they also had to aim for naturalism in Sanskrit plays and in which excellent literary works were also produced
 atev un vaiyakarnon ne sanskrit ko adarsh tehraakar usase jo visheshtaayen praakrit main thim unka vivaran upasthit kar diya or isaki sarthakata sanskrit ko praakrit kii prakruti kahkar siddh kar di
 However, Namisadhu has made his view clear that the meaning of nature is public or public and that people should be called Prakrit only after being a language
 prakruti kaa arth lok bahut pracheen he tathaa kalidas ne bhi uskaa lok ke arth main prayog kiya he 
 In the light of this very ancient tradition of Prakrit, the rationale of calling these languages late and medieval rather than Vedic and Sanskrit also becomes considerable
 uski yadi koi sarthakata he to keval itani ki ye bhashaayen vaidic or sanskrit ke pashchaat hi sahitya main prayukt huin
 They were used for the first time for religious propaganda
 Shramana Mahavir and Buddha did it in the sixth century
 tathaa unki saahitiyik rachanaaon main shabdon tathaa style kii drushti se sanskrit kaa bada prabhaav drushtigochar hota he
 As long as the language remains in the dialect, it changes constantly in comparison to the country and time
 isi niyam ke anusaar kaal ke saapeksh praakrit ke teen str sweekaar kiye gaye hai - The language or languages in which Shramana Mahavira and Buddha gave their teachings must have been excellent forms of ancient level of Prakrit
 unke upadeshon kii bhashaa ko kramash: magadhi evam ardhamagadhi kaha gaya he
 But we do not find the form of Magadhi in the texts of the language currently called Pali, as the later grammarians have told
 tathaapi bhashaa kaa jo swaroop buddha tripitak granthon main paaya jaataa he vah praakrit ke pracheen str kaa hi sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 The most authentic form of this level Prakrit is available in the scriptures engraved on the stones and pillars of Ashoka
 in shilaon kii sankhya lagbhag 30 he
 Fortunately, only the nature of the Prakrit language of the E
 East III century is safe, but in those commendations we also get the regional differences of the then language

 Combined characters containing the type also appear
 kintu jna or nay ke sthaan par na kaa prayog paaya jaataa he
 Thus, this language can be said to be the vampiric nature of grammars
 ye hi 14 prashastiyaan us bhashaa ko shauraseni kaa pracheen rup prakat karti hai
 They are also engraved with 14 testimonials at places known as Uttar Kalsi, Jaugad Nachhauli

 However, instead of three heaters, there is no existence of milk
 is prakaar yahan magadhi praakrit ke teen lakshan nahin
 Therefore, it receives two of the three symptoms of half-life Prakrit more abundantly than Magadhi, but not the third sign of affection
 atev ise magadhi kii apeksha ardhamagadhi praakrit kaa pracheen rup kahana adhik upyukt prathit hota he
 Ashoka's commendations are important in literary terms in addition to his philological significance
 unamem pracheen bharat ke ek aise samraat ke niti, dharm evam sadachaar sambandhi vichaar or upadesh nihit hai jisane na keval is vishaal desh ke samast bhaagon par raajnneetik adhikaar hi praapt kiya tha, tathaa desh ke baahar bhi alexandria tak bhinn bhinn deshon se saanskrithik sambandh sthapit kiya tha or yahan apane dharmadoot bhi bheje the
 Outside of all this, even to Alexandria, cultural relations were established with different countries and sent their apostles there
 in sab drushtiyon se yah sahitya apane dhang kaa adwitiya he
 Another example of ancient level Prakrit is the article of Kalingasamrat Kharavel engraved in the cavity named Hathigumpha of Udayagiri Khandagiri in Orissa which resembles Ashoka's inscriptions in many respects
 kintu isaki apni visheshta yah he ki isamen us samrat ke varsho kii vijayon tathaa lokkalyaan sambandhi kaaryo kaa vivaran likhaa gaya he
 Its period is supposedly BC Second century
 uski bhashaa ashok kii girnaar kii prashastiyon se mail khaati he, atev vah pracheen shauraseni kahi ja sakati he
 BC of this nature It is found in the third century in western India and its hundred, one and a half hundred years later Jain texts like Jain Shatkhandagam and Kundakundacharya etc
 in the compositions of South Pradesh are proof of its erstwhile divinity and universality
 us kaal main itnaa prachaar or kisi bhashaa kaa nahin paaya jaataa
 We find use of this ancient level of Prakrit in the available segments of plays like Sarvaputra episode, Ashwaghosh
 inamen nayakon tathaa ek do anya paatro ko chhodkar shesh sabhi paatr praakrit bolte hai, jiske teen rup spasht dikhaai dete hai
 In the Sariputra episode, in the language of the wicked, instead of,, श् in place of the three thermals, and विभ inflection as the nominative singular of the non-term nouns, these three signs clearly prove that part to be Magadhi
 yahan k t aadi aghosh varna na to g d aadi saghoshon main parivartit hue milte, na tha gh aadi mahapraan varna h main parivartit hue milte, na th gh aadi mahapraan varna hri main parivartit hue or na dantya n ke sthaan par murdhanya na dikhaai detaa
 These signs of Prakrit of Ashwaghosh are proving him of ancient status
 gorv naamak paatr kii bhashaa kii praakrit main r ke sthaan par s kaa prayog hua he
 These symptoms are proving him half-dead
 nayika, vidooshak tathaa anya paatro kii praakrit main r or l apane apane sthanon par hai
 All are found in the form of heat, and the nominative singular form is found
 inase yah bhashaa spashtat: pracheen shauraseni kahi ja sakati he
 After this, a detailed description of the distinctions of Prakrit languages is found in Bharata Natyashastra
 unhone vaani kaa paath do prakaar kaa mana he- sanskrit or praakrit; tathaa kaha he ki praakrit main teen prakaar ke shabd prachlit hai- samaan, vibhrasht or deshi
 He has given the description of linguistics in the play in this way - the best characters should speak Sanskrit, but if they become poor then speak Prakrit; Shramana, ascetic monk, woman, child, etc
 are impure
 tathaapi itnaa spasht he ki unhone k, t, da, ya or va ke lop, kha, gha aadi mahapraan varno ke sthaan par ha kaa aadesh; t kaa da, anadi t kaa aspasht da car uccharan; sht, shna aadi kaa khakaar, in parivartanon kaa ullekh kiya he
 It is evident from this that they are describing only the second level of Prakrit
 32wein adhyay main unhone dhruva naamak geetikavy kaa vistaar se udaahranon sahit varnan kiya he or spasht kaha he ki dhruva main shauraseni kaa hi prayog kiya janaa chahie 
 This is also proved by his examples
 at: pashchaatkaaleen dharna nirmul he ki naatakon ke gey bhaag main maharashtri kaa prayog kiya jaay
 Shaharaseni language should be used in drama by the opinion of Bharat or any country language as desired
 aisi deshbhashaayen saat hai - magadhi, aavanti, shauraseni, ardhamagadhi, vahlika or dakshinatya
 Magadhi for inner residents; Arghamagadhi for Chet, Rajputra and Seths; Oriya for Vidushkadi; Half-wagon for heroines and friends; Oriya for Vidushkadi; Avantha Avantha from Shaurseni for heroines and friends; Dakshinatya for warriors, civilians and gamblers; And use the Wahlika for castes, khas, shabar, shaka etc
 inke atirikt bharat ne shabar, aabhir, chandal aadi kii hin bhashaaon ko vibhasha kaha he
 In this way, the natural feelings that have been distributed among the characters of Bharata drama are partially followed in Sanskrit plays
 sanskrit naatakon main sabase adhik praakrit kaa upyog or vaichitrya shudrak krit mrichhakaticam main miltaa he
 According to Pishal, Keith scholars, etc
, the purpose of the creation of Mruthaktik seems to be to exemplify the rules of Natya Shastra related to Prakrit
 is naatak ke tikaakar prithvidhar ke matanusaar naatak main chaar prakaar kii praakrit kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he - shauraseni, avantika, praachya or magadhi
 In the play presented, 11 characters such as Sutradhar, Nati, heroine Vasantasena, Brahmin woman and superior of Charudatta and their hostess are spoken by Shaurseni
 aavanti bhashaa bolanewaale keval do apradhan paatr hai
 The jester only speaks the oriental language; Then a total of six characters, the sons of Kunj, Chetak, Monk and Charudatta, speak Magadhi, in addition to this there are two characters each of Shakari, Chandali and Dhaki
 kintu yadi in sab paatro kii bhashaa kaa vishleshan kiya jaae to ve sab keval do bhaagon main baanti ja sakati hai - shauraseni or magaghi
 The commentator himself has said that in Avanti, only Rakar and the proverbs have a multiplicity and in Oriya the selfishness of Kakar
 anya baton main ve shauraseni hi hai
 Shakari, Chandali and Dhaki are all styles of Magadhi
 is prakaar naamchaar kaa praakrit bahulya hone par bhi vastut: mrichctic main ashwaghosh ke naatakon kii apeksha koi adhik bhashabhed nahin dikhaai detaa
 The nature of Prakrit has evolved from time to time and it has got some symptoms due to which this Prakrit is said to be second level than the ancient level
 isi str kii praakrit tathaa uske deshbhedon kaa vivaran hamen uplabdh praakrit vyakaranon main miltaa he or unheen kaa vipul sahitya bhi vidyaman he
 The primary language of the second level of Prakrit is the Chandrakrit Prakrit Grammar or Aashr Prakrit Grammar
 yah ati sankshipt he or keval 99 sutron main praakrit kii vidhiyon kaa nirupan kar diya gaya he
 The formulas that characterize this level are worth noting
 sutara 76 ke anusaar virgo ke pratham k ch t t aadi varnon ke sthaan par tritiy kaa aadesh hota he, jaise, pishachi -- bissaji, jataa -- data, kruthan -- kadan, pratisiddh -- padisiddhan
 According to sutra 77, the order of hakara in the place of kh & g such as mukh - muhan, megh: - neho, madhava: - mahvo, taurus: - vasho
 sutara 97 ke anusaar k tathaa virgon ke tritiy varno kaa swar ke pare lop hota he, jaise - kokil: -- kohli, bhaugik: -- bhoio, raja -- raaya, nadi -- nai
 According to Sutra 98, when there is no beyond the missing consonant, it is like, kakau kayau, nanau naya, rajau raya
 antim 99wein sutara main kaha gaya he ki praakrit kii shesh vyavastha shisht prayogon se janani chahie
 In the four sutras ahead of them, the signs of apomorphy, the absence of the joint letter, the order of l and n in place of Peshachi, the order of l and sh in place of guide, and the order of l and sh in place of st, The command of d is stated by the option in place of t
 bhashashastriyon kaa mat he ki dwitiya str ke aadi me k aadi abodh varnon ke sthaan par g aadi saghosh varno kaa uccharan hone laga
 Then their lower sound was left and then completely omitted, and instead of mahaprana sounds only a pure warm sound was left
 ye pravritiyaan tathaa ukt aarsh vyakaran main nirdisht ya shruti vikalp se samast jain praakrit he
 But based on the misconceptions that the Prakrit grammars of the later 16th, 17th centuries have produced in the representation of Prakrit, some Western scholars considered it necessary to specify the Prakrit of Jain literature separately by the names of Jaina Shaurseni and Jain Maharashtri due to the harmony of the above options
 , It is not historically real
 is aarsh praakrit vyakaran ke pashchaat prakritprakash naamak vyakaran likhaa gaya, jisamen aage do baar vruddhi kii gai
 The nine passages of Adi are varruced
 iname adarsh praakrit kii kramash: swarvidhi, vyanjanvidhi, sanyuktavarna vidhi, sankeern, sangyaroop, sarvnaam vidhi, kriyaaroop, dhatvadesh evam avyayon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Finally it is said that the remaining form of Prakrit should be understood by Sanskrit
 is vyakaran main dwitiya str ke praakrit kaa swaroop purnroop se nirdhaarit hua paaya jaataa he
 According to it, the intermediate is often omitted by the word d and d, and the command in place of the word and language
 prakritprakash ke is pracheen vibhaag par katyayan, bhamah, vasantraj, sadanand or rampanivadakrut tikaayen pai jaati hai
 In the 10th and 12th passages, the pasachi is represented in 14 sutras and the Magadhi in 17 sutras respectively
 in donon bhashaaon kii prakruti shauraseni kahi gai he
 But before that Shoureseni's name did not come anywhere
 atev anumaanath: iske kartaaon kii drushti main saamaanya praakrit kaa nirupan us kaal kii suprachlit shorseni kaa hi he
 These two passages have only Bhamha's commentary and scholars estimate that these two passages are paired with them
 inamen pashachi kaa visheshta shabd ke madhya main tritiy chaturth varno ke sthaan par pratham tathaa dwitiya kaa aadesh, na ke sthaan par n, j, nya ke sthaan par na tathaa twa ke sthaan par tun batalaai gai he or magadhi kii sh, s, ke sthaan par ksha j ke sthaan par y, ksha ke sthaan par ek ahan ke sthaan par hake, hage va ahake, tathaa acarant karta kaarak ekvachan ke ant main e kahi gai hai
 The last 12th passage of Prakrit light appears to be added far back
 isapar bhamah va anya kisi kii tikaa nahin he
 The condition of this passage is very unique
 isamen shauraseni ke lakshan batalaaye gaye hai, jisaki aadi main hi prakruti sanskrit kahi gai hai
 But in the last 32nd sutra it has been said again: Hr Shesham Maharashtri Vat
 parantu maharashtri shabd isse purv granth bhar main athwa anya kahin vyakaran main aayaa hi nahin he
 It seems that this passage has been added at a time when the notion was strengthened that the language of Prakrit poetry should be Maharashtri
 atev jahaan praakrit kaa nirdesh he, vahaan maharashtri kaa hi taatpary grahan kiya jaay
 From the form of Shaurseni which has been described here, it is clear from this that the form which has been told here of the common nature, is the developed form of Shaurseni itself
 udaahranarth shauraseni main madhyavarti t or th ke sthaan kramash: d or dh hote hai, vahaan praakrit main d kaa lop or tha kaa ha hota he
 "bh" of metal remains "bho" in Shaurseni, but in Prakrit there is a command "ho"
 shauraseni main napunsak bahuvachan ke rup main vahaan ni hota he, jaise jalaani, vanani, vahaan praakrit ke keval i rahata he, jaise jalaain, vanain shauraseni main dola, dand tathaa dasan kaa aadi d prakruti rup rahata he, jabaki praakrit main vah d ho jaataa he, jaise dola, dand va dasan ityadi
 After Prakritprakash, the Prakrit grammar was written by Hemachandra in the 12th century AD, making a complete representation of Prakrit and its regional languages
 iske chaar pariched hai, jinamein se lagbhag saadhe teen parichchhedon main praakrit kaa suvyavasthit vivaran diya gaya he or shesh lagbhag 200 sutron main kramash: shauraseni, magadhi, pashachi, chulika pashachi or apbhransh bhashaaon ke vishesh lakshan batalaaye hai
 The form of the first three of these languages is the same as the one detailed above
 chulika pashachi ke lakshan yahan chaar sutron main ye batalaaye gaye hai ki usamen tisare or chauthe varno ke sthaan par pratham or dwitiya kaa aadesh hota he, r kaa l vikalp se hota he, kuch aacharyo ke mat se adivarna kii dhwani main parivartan nahin hota, shesh baaten pashachi ke samaan janani chahie

 radio sangrahi ek vidyut paripath he jo vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke rup main uplabdh sanketon ko antena ke dwaara grahan karne ke baad iskaa samyak prasanskaran karte hue ant main dhwani yaa kisi anya upyogi rup main prastut karata he
 The study of the production and properties of radio waves was first attempted by Heinrich Hertz in 1887
 apane itihaas prasiddh prayog main radio tarangon ke utpaadan kii vyavastha dwaara utpann tarangon ko unhone swayan hi sphulingon ke rup main do ghundiyon ke bich praapt kiya tha jo taar ke ek fande ke donon siron par sthit thim
 This early experiment by Herts indicated the possibility of eclipsing modes of radio waves, on the basis of which Oliver Lodge built a special type of detector in England in 1894, which transformed radio waves into waves of audio frequency

 sansuchak ke rup main in vaalvon ke upyog ne anek kathinaaiyon evam samasyaon kaa niraakaran kar diya
 In about a year of this, Anant Lee de Forest created a revolution in the field of electronic and radio communication systems by the implementation of triode valves
 ye valve tathaa inke anek sanshodhit roopon yatha tetrod evam pentod aadi vaalvon ko hi radio sanchaar pranali ko aadhunik rup tak pahunchaane kaa shrey diya ja saktaa he
 The amplifiers, detectors and vibrators that make the integrated circuits are designed with the help of these valves
 radio sanchaar pranali kaa vah ang jo arial tak nirantar pahunchaanevaali radio aavriti urja se vaanchit ansh pruthak kar grahan karata he, radio sangrahi kehalaata he
 All types of radio collectors basically have to do the following: antena par nirantar anek prakaar ke radio sanket pahonchte rahete hai, jo sansar ke vibhinn bhaagon main sthit preshan kendron se preshit hote hai
