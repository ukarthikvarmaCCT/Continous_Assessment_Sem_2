 bharat main puralekhvidya kaa prarambh ashok ke lekhon ke adhyayan se prarambh hua
 Many articles of Ashoka have been found written on rocks, pillars etc
 parantu kaaphi samay tak un lekhon kaa adhyayan na ho sakaa kyonki ve lekh brahmi lipi main likhe hue hai or brahmi lipi kaa gyaata vartmaan bharat main koi nahin tha
 The pandits of our country had forgotten the ancient Brahmi centuries ago even though all the scripts of today's India were derived from Brahmi
 dilli ke sultan ferojshah tughlak ne 1356i
 main topra va meerut ke ashok-stambh dilli main mangvakar khadey karwaae the
 Feroz Tughlaq invited the Pandits to read the engraved articles on these pillars, but at that time there was not a single Pandit who could read these Brahmi articles of Ashoka
 in stambhon par kya likhaa hua he, yah jaanane ke liye akbar bhi bada utsuk tha, kintu us samay bhi aisa koi pandit nahin mila jo in lekhon ko pard sake
 It is clear from this that the knowledge of the old Brahmi script had disappeared before the establishment of Islamic State in India

 wilkins ko dasvin sadi ke aasapaas ke kuch lekhon ko padhane main safalataa mili or unhone guptkaal ke lekhon kii lagbhag aadhi varnmaala ko bhi pahchaan liya
 But Ashoka's records are about six hundred years old, so it was not possible to read them easily
 aarambh main europe ke puralipividon kii kalpana thi ki ashok ke lekhon kii bhashaa sanskrit he
 Therefore, there was some delay in the inauguration of Ashoka's Brahmi script

 Prinsep was the mint officer of Calcutta and also the secretary of the Asiatic Society

 Now he started reading more old articles
 unhone kai sthanon ke shilalekhon ke chaape mangavaaye or aksharon ko mila-milakar inkaa adhyayan karte rahe
 Finally 1837 AD He recognized the letters of the word 'danan' in some of Sanchi's writings and then soon recognized the remaining letters of Brahmi
 is prakaar james princep ne brahami lipi kii lagbhag puri varnmaala kaa udghaatan kiya
 After this great discovery, a new chapter in the study of Indian history and culture started
 princep ke baad desh-videsh ke anekanek vidwaanon ne puralekhon kaa adhyayan shuru kar diya
 Since then, the people of India started getting accurate information about the ancient culture of their country
 aaj ham ashok kii brahami lipi tathaa is lipi se viksit lipiyon main likhe gaye saare lekhon ko pard sakate hai
 The ancient history of India was dark before the study of inscriptions

 The World Tourism Organization forecasts that international tourism will continue to grow with an average annual rate of 4%
 Europe will remain the most popular destination by 2020, but its share, which was 46% in 1995, will fall by 60%
 Long-haul's growth will be slightly faster than integrated travel, and its share will increase from 24% in 1995 to 18% by 2020
 Will increase

 sangeet main, swar-sangati pichon yaa cords kaa ek hi saath upyog he
 The study of vocal consistency involves the theory of chords and their composition and the sequence of chords and combinations that govern them
 swar sangati ko melodic line, yaa kshaitijiya pahalu se utkrisht or aksar sangeet ke "lambavat" pahalu ke rup main sanderbhit mana jaataa he
 The asymmetry that refers to the interconnectedness of the melodic line and polyphony, which indicates the relationship between separate independent tones, is thus sometimes superior to vowel consistency
 shabd harmoni unani ἁρμόζω se vyutpann he jiskaa arth "sanyukt, qaraar, anviti", kriya ἁρμόζω se "ek saath karnaa, jodna" hota he
 The term was often used for the entire field of music, while "music" generally referred to art
 pracheen greece main, is shabd ne tatwon ke visham sangyojan ko paribhaashit kiya: ek thodaa ucch or thodaa nimna note
 phir bhi, yah spasht nahin he ki noton kii samakalik khaas dhwani pracheen greek sangeet abhyaas kaa hissaa thi yaa nahin, hormonia keval alag pichon ke bich sambandhon ke vargeekaran kii ek pranali ko hi pradaan kar saki he
 In the Middle Ages the term was used in Bandish to describe two Peach sounds, and during the Renaissance this concept was expanded to denote three sound peaches simultaneously
 1972 main ramea ke Traité de l'harmonie' ke prakaashan tak sangeet abhyaas ke bare main vichaar karne vaale paath main is shabd kaa prayog nahin hua, yaddapi yah kaary is vishay ke saidhantik vichaar kaa sabase praarambhik vichaar nahin he
 The underlying principle behind these texts is that vocal consistency restricts harmony while harmonizing particular pre-established structural principles
 sankshipt vivaran dete hue vartmaan shabdkosh paribhaasha, praaia: aadhunik upyog main is shabd kii aspashtataa ko ujagar karne kaa prayaas karti he
 Ambiguities arise either for aesthetical reasons or because of the idea of musical texture describing the difference between "harmonic" and contrapuntal
 In the words of Arnold Whittle: yah vichaar ki pashchimi sangeet main aadhunik swarik swar sangati 1600 main shuru hui, sangeet siddhant main samanyokti he
 This is often traced by the replacement of horizontal writing common in Renaissance music, with a new emphasis on the 'vertical' element of composed music
 aadhunik siddhantkaar, haalanki, ise ek asantoshjanak samanyikaran ke rup main dekhte hai
 As Carl Dalhaus writes: hormoni or hormonic abhyaas kaa vivaran or paribhaasha europe kii sangeet paramparaon kii ore jhuki hui dikhti hai
 For example, South Asian art music is referred to as traditional harmonies with little focus on the meaning emanating from Western music, the underlying harmonic basis for most South Asian music is the drone, a Held Open Fifth
 That does not change throughout the structure of the peach
 Pitch contemporaneity, in particular, is rarely a major consideration
 us par bhi peach ke anya bahut saare vivechan sangeet, iske siddhant or sanrachana ke liye praasangik hai, jaise ki raagon kii jatil sanrachana, jo melodic or model donon vivechanon or iske andar ke kodikaran ko jodatii he
 So although Indian classical music produces complex combinations of pitches simultaneously, they are rarely studied in teleological harmonic or contractual sequences as with notated Western music
 yah visham jor pradarshan ke apanaae gaye vibhinn vidhiyon ko kuch had tak khud hi jaahir karata he: bhartiya sangeet main taatkaalik pradarshan khand ke sanrachanaatmak dhaanche main ek gambhir bhoomika nibhaataa he, jabaki pashchimi sangeet main taatkaalik pradarshan 19veen shatabdi ke ant se hi anokhaa rahaa he
 When this occurs in Western music, the immediate performance either refines the previously notated music or, if not, expels the models of the music that have already been established in the notated music Is and therefore employs familiar harmonic schemes
 haalanki, isamen koi shaq nahin ki europea kala sangeet main or iske aasapaas ke likhit siddhanton main purvasanrachit par jor mahatvapurn saanskrithik purvaagrah ko darshata he
 The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians defines it quite clearly: pashchimi kala sangeet main abhi tak hormonic abhyaas or bhashaa kaa vikaas isi purv sanrachana pakriya dwaara sugam banaaya gaya he or tha pradarshan kii prakruti se beparwaah ho kar aparivartit rahete hai, sadrush siddhantkaron or sangeetkaaron ke dwaara adhyayan or vishleshan kii anumati di
 Some traditions of musical performance, composition and theory have certain rules of harmony
 ye niyam aksar prakritik gunon par aadhaarit hote hai jaise ki pithogorian tunings lau hole number reshio, yaa hormonix or rigonence, sweekaarya pichon ke saath or swar-sangeet apana soundarya yaa saadagi un gunon kii nikatataa se praapt karti he
 While Pythagoras ratios may provide rough estimates of perceptual harmonicity, they may not be accountable for cultural elements
 praarambhik pashchimi dharmik sangeet aksar saamanantar purna antaraalon ko vishisht banaate hai; ye antaraal mul planesong kii spashtataa ko sangrakshit karte hai
 These works were performed and performed in the cathedral and their resonant form was used in the respective cathedrals to produce harmonies
 jaise hi poliphoni viksit hua, samaanaantar antaraalon ke upyog kaa sthaan dhire-dhire anuroopya kii angreji style ne le liya, jisane tisare yaa chathe kaa istemaal kiya
 It is believed to have a relatively sweet sound in the English style and is more suited to a polfony that offers more linear flexibility in part-writing
 praarambhik sangeet ne tritone ke upyog par bhi roak laga diya, kyonki isaki karkashta shaitan se sambandhit thi or sangeetkaar aksar iske upyog se bachane ke liye mujika phicta ke madhyam se adhik lambaai kii ore chale jate the
 In the new triadic harmonic system, however, the tritone became acceptable, as standardization of behavioral constriction made its use in the dominant cord desirable
 yadhyapi adhikansh swar-sangati do yaa adik note ke ek saath dhvanit hone ke parinamswaroop ghatit hoti he, arpegios yaa hocket ke upyog dwaara keval ek molodic line ke saath swar-sangati ko majbootee ke saath suchit kiya ja saktaa he
 Many notes of the Baroque era for solo stringed instruments, such as Back's Sonata and Pertitage for solo violins, report proper vocal harmony by results rather than full chordal structures; see below: karl dalhousie samanvit or adhinsth swar-sangati main bhed karte hai
 Subordinate phonetics is the graded tonalite known today as tonal phonetics, while coordinated phonation is a relatively old medieval and Renaissance periodic tonalite ancienne, the term meant to describe the effects of harmony goal-directed development Are attached to each other without being raised
 ek pehla cord ek duusare cord ke saath ek kadi banaata he or teesraa chauthe ke saath
 lekin purv cord kadi baad kii kadi se swatantra hoti he or iskaa vipareet kram ghatit hota he
 Coordinated vocalization follows direct relations rather than indirect as in subordinate
 antaraal chakra samametiya swar- sangati utpann karata he, jiskaa upyog alban berg, jorge parl, arnold scoenberg, bela bertok jaise sangeetkaaron or edgard vairis kii density 21
5 dwaara vyapak rup se kiya gaya he
 Other types of vocalizations are based on the intervals used to compose the cord used in that vocalization
 pashchimi sangeet main prayog kiye gaye adhikansh cord "tertian" swar-sangati yaa tisare antaraal se bane cord par aadhaarit hote hai
 Cord c Major 7 contains C-E Major Third, E-G is Minor Third and g to b is a Major Third
 swar- sangati ke anya prakaar kwartal swar-sangati or quintal swar-sangati se bane hote hai
 An interval is the relationship between two different musical pitches
 udhaaharan ke liye, "tvinkal tvinkal little star" dhun main pehle do note or duusare do note ek ke paanchave bhaag ke antaraal par hote hai
 Does this mean that if the first two notes were pitch "C", the second two notes would be pitch "G" - four scale notes, or, above, seven chromatic notes
 nimnlikhit aam antaraal hai: In this way, combining the notes with their specific intervals - a chord - creates a melody
 udhaaharan ke liye, si cord main teen note hote hai: si, i or ji
 "si" note mul he, "i" or "ji" note ke saath swar sangati pradaan karata hua or ji7 cord main, prayek anuvarthi note ke saath mul ji swar-sangati pradaan karata he
 In the musical scale, there are twelve pitches
 prayek pich ke scale ko ek "degree" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 The names of A, B, C, D, E, f and g are negligible
 haalanki, antaraal naganya nahin hote
 yahaan ek udhaaharan he: As can be seen, no single note always corresponds to a certain degree of scale
 "root", yaa pratham-degree note scale ke 12 noton main se koi bhi ho saktaa he
 All other notes fall in place
 to, jab si mul note hota he, chauthaa degree epa hota he
 But when d is the original note, the fourth degree is G
 is tarah jabaki note ke naam drudh hote hai, vahiin antaraalon ke saath aisa nahin hota
 In the layman's view: a "fourth" is always the fourth, regardless of what the original note is
 is tathy kii mahaan shakti yah he ki kisi bhi sur main kisi bhi geet ko bajaayaa yaa gaaya ja saktaa he- yah vahi geet hoga, jab tak ki antaraalon ko samaan rakhaa jaataa he, is tarah swar-sangati kaa sthanantaran sadrush sur main kiya jaataa he
 When the interval crosses the octave, these intervals are named "extended intervals", including the 9th, 11th, and 13th intervals, which are widely used in jazz and blues music
 vistaarit antaraal banaae jate hai or nimnlikhit ke rup main jane jate hai: In addition to this classification, intervals can also be divided into harmonics and constrictions
 jaisaa ki nimnlikhit anuchhed main vyakhya kii gai he, samaswar antaraal vishram kii samvednaa paidaa karte hai or karkash tanaav kii samvednaa
 The corresponding intervals are considered to be equal, octave, fifth, fourth and manger and minor third
 tisare ko apurna mana jaataa he, jabaki purvavarti ko purna mana jaataa he
 In classical music, the fourth can be considered to be hoarse when its function is contractual
 anya antaraal, jaise 7waan, 9waan, 11waan or 13waan karkash maane jate hai or inhen vibhedan or aksar taiyaari kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the Western tradition, vocalization is used efficiently using cords, which are a combination of peach ranges
 tersian yaa tertial swar-sangati main, ek tisare swar ke antaraal par namit, cord ke sadsy major or miner tisare swar antaraalon ko krambaddh karne ke dwaara paae or namit kiye jate hai, "mul" se shuru hokar, iske baad mul par "teesraa swar" or mul par "paanchavaa swar", ityadi
kripaya dhyaan den ki cord ke sadsy mul ke antaraalon ke aadhaar par namit kiye jate hai, cord banane main unke sankhyatmak antarveshan ke dwaara nahin
 Traditionally, a cord must have at least three members in order to be called a cord, although 2-member dyads are sometimes considered a cord, especially in rock
 The three-member wheel cord is called a triad because it has three members, not because it is necessarily manufactured in the third
 Different types of cords are formed due to the sorted notes being made based on the width of the gap
 lokapriy or jaij swar-sangati main, cord ke naam unke mul ke saath hi unke gunvattta ke vibhinn sambandhon or charitron kaa sanket dene vaale ke aadhaar par rakhaa jaataa he
 Some defaults are approved to keep the roll as simple as possible
 For example, the C, E, g cord members of a c major triad are commonly called "C" cords by default
 ek 'e ♭ "cord" main, e♭, si or i♭ sadsy hote hai
 In many types of music, particularly Baroque and Jazz, chords are often associated with "tensions"
 tanaav ek atirikt cord sadsy hota he jo ek yaa adhik cord sadasyon ke sambandh main apekshaakrit karkash antaraal utpann karata he
 Following the Tarsian practice of cord formation by the third vowel stack, the simplest first tense over the original vowel, the third and fifth vowels, is joined by a triad by stanning, the other third vowel above the fifth vowel, a new one
 While giving the vowel, a strongly husky member of a seventh vowel differs from the original vowel and is thus called the "seventh" vowel of the cord and produces a four-note chord, zi Is called the "seventh cord"
 cord nirmaan ke liye akele tisare swar ke stack kii chaudaai par nirbhar karte hue, cord ke saatven swar or mul swar ke bich kaa antaraal major, miner yaa kam kiya ja saktaa he
 
 The nomenclature allows, by default, "C7" to indicate the original vowel, the third and fifth cord, and the seventh vowel C, E, g and b ♭
 saatven cord ke anya prakaaron ko adhik spasht tareeke se namit kiya janaa chahie, jaise ki "si major 7", "si sanvardhit 7", ityadi
namakaran kii purna pradarshnee ke liye dekhen cord 
 The "vowel" or "upper tension", the continuous stack of the third vowel above the seventh cord, brings the ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth, and forms a cord named above them
 
 terahavin ke pare kaa ekstansion maujuuda cord sadasyon ko dubaara paidaa karata he or namavali ke baahar chhod diya jaataa he
 Intricate vocal accompaniment based on extended chords is found in abundance in jazz, modern orchestral works, film music, etc
 aamtaur par, shastreey sangeet kii aam chalan avadhi main ek karkash cord samaswar cord main "rijolve" ho jayega
 swar-sangatikaran aamtaur par kaan ke liye sukhad lagata he jab samaswar or karkash dhwani ke bich ek santulan rahata he
 In simple terms, it occurs when there is a balance between moments of "tension" and "relaxation"
 is kaaran se, aamtaur par tanaav paidaa kiya jaataa he or iske baad usko 'khatm' kiya jaataa he
 Stress preparation means placing a series of harmonic chords, which paves the way to the hoarse tone
 is tarah se sangeetkaar aasaani se or shrota ko pareshaan kiye bina, tanaav kaa parichay karana sunishchit karata he
 Once the piece reaches its sub-climax, the listener needs a moment to release the tension, which is achieved by playing the melody which eliminates the tension of the anterior cord
 is tanaav kaa samashodhan aamtaur par shrota ke liye sukhad lagata he
 Consistency is based on analogies, a concept whose definition has changed many times during the history of Western music
 ek manovaigyanik ke drushtikon main, anuroopya satat parivartansheel he
 Analogies can vary over a wide range
 ek hi cord vibhinn kaarnon se samaswar lag saktaa he
 One is the lack of perceptual roughness
 khurdarapan tab ghatit hota he jab parshals ek jatil bandwidth ke andar pad jate he, jo vibhinn aavritiyaan alag karne kii kaan kii kshamta kaa ek paimaana he
 Complex bandwidths lie between 2 and 3 semitones at high frequencies and become larger at lower frequencies
 do samakalik swar-sangtiya jatil tone kaa khurdarapan or tone ke bich antaraal or swar-sangati vipulata par nirbhar karata he
 The most rough interval in the chromatic scale is the interference of Minor II and its major seventh
 kendriya range main theth varnakrameey invelp ke liye, doosraa sabase khurdara antaraal major dwitiya or major saatvaan or uske baad tritone, miner teesraa, major teesraa or purna chauthaa he
 The second reason is perceptual fusion
 ek hi cord dharna main fus hote hai agar uskaa samgr spectrum hormonic shrinkhalaa ke samaan he
 According to this definition, a major triad fuses better than a minor triad, and a major-minor seventh cord is a much better fuse than a major-major seventh or a minor-minor seventh
 ye matbhed tatkaal swabhaav ke sandarbhon main spasht nahin he lekin samajhaate hai ki kyon mukhya dhara ke tonal sangeet main major triad aamtaur par miner triad se zyada prachlit hai or major-miner saatvaan swar anya saatven se adhik prachlit hai
 Of course these comparisons depend on style
 teesraa kaaran parichiti he
 Chords that are often heard in musical contexts produce more sound
 yah siddhant pashchimi sangeet ke hormonic jatilta main kramik aitihaasik vruddhi kii vyakhya karata he
 For example, around 1600 the unprepared seventh cord gradually became familiar and therefore gradually came to be regarded as more harmonious
 pashchimi sangeet major or miner triad par aadhaarit he
 The reason why these cords are central is that they are harmonized in terms of both fusion and lack of roughness
 ve sanlayit hote hai kyonki unamem chauthaa / paanchvaan antaraal shaamil hai
 They lack roughness because they lack major and minor second intervals
 chromutik scale main in tonon kaa koi bhi sangyojan in mandandon ko santusht nahin karata he
 As Frank Zappa explains it, duusare shabdon main, ek sangeetkaar anany rup se samaswar dhvaniyon kaa prayog karke shrotaaon kii pasand ko sunishchit nahin kar saktaa
 haalanki, atirikt tanaav se shrota pareshaan ho saktaa he
 a balance between the two is often considered desirable
 samakaleen sangeet is tarah se viksit hua he ki isamen barok or clasical yug kii apeksha tanaav ko aksar kam taiyaar yaa sanrachit kiya jaataa he or is tarah jaij or bluej jaisi nai sheliyaan paidaa kii ja rahi hai, jahaan tanaav praaia: nahin hi banaayin jaati hai

 When the country level session of the Congress was held in Nagpur in 1920, Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar presented the first proposal in the Congress about the goal of complete independence, then it was not passed
 In 1921, Satyagraha was arrested in the non-cooperation movement of the Congress and he was imprisoned for one year
 By then he had become so popular that veterans like Pandit Motilal Nehru and Hakim Ajmal Kha addressed the gathering organized to welcome him upon his release

 Parapanje along with a dozen of his colleagues, in which he was imprisoned for 9 months
 Similarly, in 1929 when the resolution of the former Swaraj was passed in the Congress session held in Lahore and on 26 January 1930, a call was made to hoist the tricolor across the country, on the instructions of Dr

 pitrubhu-punyabhu Bhushchev sa Hindu Hindu tradition is shloke ke anusaar “bharat ke vah sabhi log hindu hai jo is desh ko pithrubhumi-punyabhumi maanate hai”l iname sanatani, aryasamaji, jain, buddha, sikh aadi panthon evam dharm vichaar ko maanane vaale va unka aacharan karne vaale samast jan ko hindu ke vyapak daayre main rakhaa gaya tha l musalmaan va isai is paribhaasha main nahin aate the atah unako is milicia main naa lene kaa nirnay liya gaya or keval hinduon ko hi liya janaa tay hua, mukhya mantra tha “aspashtataa nivaaran evam hinduon kaa sainiki kaaran”l To create such a militia, volunteers were recruited, branches were started for one hour each morning and evening
 To make it run smoothly, posts of teacher, head teacher, event etc
 were created
 In these branches it was decided to provide military education to senior volunteers along with exercise, manual labor, education of Hindu nationalism
 Sometimes during the night there were seminars of volunteers, including Maharana Pratap, Veer Shivaji, Guru Govind Singh, Banda Bairagi, Veer Savarkar, Mangal Pandey, Tantya Tope etc

This is the case of all those who live here
 Sorry that such statement / gentlemen do not know the meaning of the word nation
 Only a piece of land is not called a nation
 The people who have lived in the civilization and tradition since ancient times, a nation is formed by the culture of the same people
 This country has been named Hindusthan because of us
 If other people give it through communication If you want to settle in, then you can definitely settle
 We have never denied them, but we will not get even a single place here for those who come to our house as guests and take a knife on our neck
 l First get this ideology of Sangh right
 ek anya avasar par dow headgavar ne kaha tha “sangh to keval, hindusthan hinduon kaa- is dhyey vaakya ko sachcha kar dikhaanaa chahta he l” duusare deshon ke saamaan, “yah hinduon kaa hone ke kaaran”- is desh main hindu jo kahenge vahi purv disha hogi l yahi ek baat he jo sangh jaanata he, rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ke liye kisi bhi anya pachade main padane kii aavashkata nahin he l” When Veer Savarkar was off sight in Ratnagiri, Dr
 Hedgewar went to meet him there
 tab tak vah vir saavarkar rachit pustak hindutv bhi pard chuke the
 Dr
 Hedgewar was very impressed with the ideas of that book and praised it saying that "veer Savarkar is an ideal person"
 donon kaa vishwaas tha ki jab tak hindu andh vishwaas, puraani roodhiwaadee soch, dharmik aadambaron ko nahin chhodenge tab tak hindu-jateevaad, chhot-achhut, shahari-banavaasi or chhetravaad ityadi main banta rahegaa or jab tak vah sangathit evam ek jute nahin hoga, tab tak vah sansar main apana uchit sthaan nahin le sakegaa

 is dharm ke anuyaayi ko sikh kaha jaataa he
 The religious text of Sikhs is Sri Adi Granth or Gyan Guru Granth Sahib
 aamtaur par sikhon ke 10 satgur maane jate hai, lekin sikhon ke dharmik granth main 6 guruon sahit 30 bhagaton kii bani he, jin kii saamaan sikhyaon ko sikh maarg par chalane ke liye mahatvapurn mana jaataa ha
 The religious place of Sikhs is called Gurdwara
 1469 isvi main punjab main janme nanak dev ne gurmat ko khoja or gurmat kii sikhyaon ko desh deshaantar main khud ja ja kar failaayaa tha
 The Sikhs consider him their first guru
 gurmat kaa parchaar baaki 9 guruon ne kiya
 The 10th Guru Gobind Singh Ji preached to the philanthropic Khalsa to acidify the teachings of the Guru Granth Sahib
 sant kabir, dhana, sadhana, ramanand, paramanand, namdev itiyadi, jin kii bani aadi granth main darj he, un bhagaton ko bhi sikh satguruon ke saamaan maanate hai or un ki sikhyaon par amal karne ki koshish karte hai
 Sikhs believe in a single God, whom they call one-onkar
 unka maananaa he ki ishwar akaal or nirankaar he
 The Sikh Panth has a sacred and unique place in India, the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev is the originator of Sikhism
 unhone apane samay ke bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt kuprathaon, andhvishwaason, jarjar roodhiyon or pakhandon ko dur karte hue 
 He founded Sikhism on the firm foundation of love, service, hard work, philanthropy and brotherhood
 tajjub nahin ki ek udaaravaadi drushtikon se gurunanak dev ne sabhi dharmon kii achchhaayiyon ko samahit kiya
 His main precept was that God is one, He created all
 hindu musalmaan sabhi ek hi ishwar kii santan hai or ishwar ke liye sabhi samaan hai
 He has also told that God is true and man should do good deeds so that he does not have to be ashamed in the court of God
 gurunanak ne apane ek sabad main kaha he ki pandit pothee padhate hai, kintu vichaar ko nahin boojhte
 Teaches others, this makes their business of Maya
 unki kathani juthi he, ve sansar main bhatakate rahete hai
 They have no idea of the essence of couplet
 ye pandit to vaad-vivaad main hi pade rahete hai
 Guru Arjun Dev even goes so far as to say that God is pervasive like fire is absorbed in all vegetation and ghee is absorbed in milk
 isi tarah paramatma kii jyoti oonch-neech sabhi main vyaapt he paramatma ghat-ghat main vyaapt he- To make Sikhism strong and Maryadasampada, Guru arjun-dev did a huge historical and eternal work by editing the Adi Granth
 unhone aadi granth main paanch sikh guruon ke saath 15 santon evam 14 rachanakaaron kii rachanaaon ko bhi sasamman shaamil kiya
 The names of these five gurus are - Guru Nanak, Guru Angaddev, Guru Amardas, Guru Ramdas and Guru Arjun Dev
 sheikh farid, jayadev, trilochan, sadhana, namdev, veni, ramanand, kabir, ravidaas, peepa, saitha, dhanna, bheekhan, parmanand or surdaas 15 santon kii vaani ko aadigranth main sangrahit karke guruji ne apni udaar maanavtaavaadi drushti kaa parichay diya
 Not only this, he ranked the compositions of 14 creators like Haribans, Balha, Mathura, Gaynd, Nalh, Bhalla, Salh Bhikkha, Kirat, Bhai Mardana, Sundardas, Rai Balwand and Satta Doom, Kalsahar, Jalap and gave them a high status
 did
 yah adbhut kaary karte samay guru arjuna dev ke saamne dharm jati, kshetra or bhashaa kii kisi seemaa ne avrodh paidaa nahin kiya
 He knew that all these gurus, saints and poets have the same cultural, ideological and thinking base
 ullekhneey he ki guru arjunadev ne jab aadigranth kaa sampaadan-kaary 1604 i
 main purna kiya tha tab usamen pehle paanch guruon kii vaniyan thim
 After this Guru Gobind Singh finalized the Adigranth by incorporating the voice of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur
 aadi-granth main 15 santon ke kul 778 pad hai
 Of these 541 are from Kabir, 122 from Sheikh Farid, 60 from Namdev and 40 from Sant Ravidas
 anya santon ke ek se chaar padon kaa aadi granth main sthaan diya gaya he
 It is worth noting that these compositions stored in Adi Granth are completely safe without any change for more than 400 years
 lekin apane dehavsaan ke purv guru govind singh ne sabhi sikhon ke aadhyatmik maargdarshan ke liye guru granth sahab or unke sansaarik disha-nirdesan ke liye samooche khalsa panth ko ‘guru pad’ par asin kar diya
 At that time Adigranth came to be accepted as Guru Sahib
 sikh dharm ko kaaljayi banane ke liye guru govind singh ne sabhi dharmon or jatiyon ke logon ko guru-shishy-parampara main dikshit kiya
 He created this new human being for centuries to come
 yah nayaa manushya jatiyon evam dharmon main vibhakt na hokar dharm, maanav evam desh ke sangrakshan ke liye sadaiv katibaddh rahane vaala he
 This structure of taking everyone along is, no doubt, the Sikh psyche
 phir, sikh dharm kaa param lakshya maanav-kalyaan hi to he
 Perhaps to teach the lesson of this human welfare, Guru Govind Singh wrote a long letter to Aurangzeb, which mentions the praise of God as well as the poignant mention of injustice and atrocities that took place during Aurangzeb's reign
 is patr main nek karm karne or maasoom praja kaa khun na bahaane kii naseehaten, dharm evam ishwar kii aad main makkaari or jhooth ke liye chetavanee tathaa yoddha kii tarah maidan jang main aakar yuddh karne ke liye lalkaar he
 It is said that Aurangzeb's rage arose after reading this letter and after that he did not live long
 guru ji se ek baar bhent karne kii uski andaruni ichha bhi puri na ho saki
 It is not a credit to be given that the values on which the simple, simple, simple and natural life of the Sikh Gurus was based, they had certainly adopted those values from the traditional Indian consciousness
 desh, kaal or paristhitiyon kii maang ke anusaar unhone apane vyaktitv ko dhalkar tatkaaleen rajnatik, saamaajik, dharmik, aarthik evam saanskrithik jivan ko gahare main prabhavit kiya tha
 Sikh Gurus influenced the religion and social order of their time
 sikh guruon ne apane samay ke dharm or samaaj-vyavastha ko ek nai disha di
 He removed devotion, knowledge, worship, spirituality and philosophy from a narrow circle and brought the society among those who were completely deprived of it
 isse logon kaa aatmbodh jaagaa or unamem ek nai drushti evam jagriti panpi, ve swanubhoot anubhav ko manyata dene lage
 In this way the flow of the formless ultimate power was intensified and quickly received
 sikh dharm kii ek anya marke kii vishistataa yah he ki sikh guruon ne manushya ko udhyam karte hue jivan jeene, kamaate hue sukh praapt karne or dhyaan karte hue prabhu kii prapti karne kii baat kahi
 He believed that a person who works hard remains free from all worries
 guru nanak ne to yahan tak kaha he ki jo vyakti mehnat karke kamata he or usamen kuch daan-punya karata he, vahi sahi maarg ko pahachaanata he
 The 'langar' system introduced by Sikh Gurus is an example not found elsewhere in cosmopolitanism, human love, equality and generosity
 sikh guruon ne kabhi na murajhaane vaale saanskrithik evam naitik mulyon kii bhi sthapana kii
 He had foreseen with his philosophical and spiritual thinking what the time would be like
 isliye unhone andhi nakal ke khilaaf vaikalpik chintan par jor diya
 Physical practice and humor is considered to be an essential part of life
 punjab ke lokgeeton, lokanrutyon evam hola mahallaa par shastradhariyon ke pradarshit kartabon ke mul main sikh guruon ke prerana-beej hi hai
 The roots of these folk songs and folk dances erupt from the soil of Punjab and cause panic among the people
 bhangada or giddha punjab kii saanskrithik shaan hai, jisaki dhadkan desh-videsh main praaia: suni jaati he
 Punjabi culture is the backbone of nationality
 iske praan main ekatv he, iske rakt main sahanubhuti, sahyog, karunaa or maanav-prem he
 Punjabi culture connects man and builds his identity
 vishwa ke kisi kone main ghumta-phirata punjabi swayan main se ek laghu punjab kaa praturup he
 Every Sikh has his or her own independent consciousness, which has been seriously thinking about solving life-related problems in its own light
 sikh guruon kaa itihaas uthaakar dekh lijie, unhone samrajyavaadee avadharana katai nahin banaai, ulte saanskriti, k dharmik evam aadhyatmik saamanjasy ke madhyam se maanavtaavaadi sansar kii drushti hi karte rahe
 The people of this earth have maintained their peaceful existence in spite of the period of indo-pak partition before independence and several decades after the violent violence and persecution in Punjab
 kaundh inkaa maargdarshan karti rahi he
 Sikhs have ten gurus
 shri guru granth sahib ji sikhon kaa dharmik granth he
 Sikhism begins with "one"
 sikhon ke dharm granth main "ek" kii hi vyakhya hai
 One is known by the names of Nirankara, Parbrahma etc
 nirankaar kaa swaroop shri gurugranth sahib ke shuruyaat main bataaya he jisko aam bhashaa main 'mul mantra' kehete hai
 Almost all religions worship this "one", but the various stages of "one" are mentioned and explained in Shri Guru Granth Sahib ji is unique in itself
 jeev aatma jo niraakaar he, us ke paas nirankaar ke sirf 4 hi gun vyaapt he As soon as the other four qualities are attained, the living soul goes back to Nirankar, but in order to attain it, it is necessary for the living soul to understand itself through the knowledge of Gurmat
 ise sikh dharm main "aatam chintan" kaha jaataa he
 The formless form of the soul is known in the basic Sikhs of Sikhism
 in kii gatividhion ko samaj kar insaan khud ko samaj saktaa he
 Sikhism begins with soul knowledge
 aatma kya he? kaha se ai he? vajood kyon he? karnaa kya he itihaadi ruhaniyat ke vishe sikh prachaar dwaara padhaaye jate hai
 What are the disorders of the soul, how should the disorder be free aatma swayam nirankaar kii ansh he
 Gets knowledge of nirankara by making it known
 sikhmat carmik falsafe main yakeen nahin rakhata
 Other religions say that God likes good deeds and God does very bad things with those who are bad
 lekin sikh dharm ke anusaar insaan khud kuch kar hi nahin saktaa
 a human being is limited to thinking only, that is what is in the "order", whether it is donating to a poor person or if he is killing someone
 yahi baat shri gurugranth sahib ji ke shuru main hi drudh karvaa di thi : That is why sin is not accepted in Gurmat
 agar insaan koi kriya karata he to wo antar aatma ke saath awaz mila kar kare
 It is Karna that Gurmat is against Karma scandal
 shri guru nanak dev ji ne apane samay ke bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt kuprathaon, andhvishwaason, jarjar roodhiyon or pakhandon ko dur karte hue jan-saadhaaran ko dharm ke thekedaaron, pandon, piron aadi ke changul se mukt karne kii koshish kii
 It is mandatory for the following four 'substances' to be received by humans in their lifetime: dharm, arth, kaam, moksh ko chaar padaarthon main nahin liya gaya
 Mr
 Guru Gobind Singh Ji says: sikhamat main bhakton evam satguron ne nirankaar ko akar rahit kaha he
 Because earthly substances are finished one day but Parabrahma never dies
 isi liye use akaal kaha gaya he
 Not only this, the living soul is also devoid of form and is tied with this body for some time
 iskaa vajood sharir ke bagaiyr bhi he, jo aam manushya kii budhi se dur he
 It is Karna that Sikhism is strongly against idol worship
 satguruon evam bhakton ne murti pujakon ko andha, jaanavar itiyadi shabdon se niwaja he
 His picture cannot be made
 yahi nahin koi bhi sansari padaarth jaise kii kabar, bhakton evam satguruon ke itihaasak padaarth, pratimaayein adik ko poojana sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf he
 Knowledge of religious texts is a method that leads to the country of Nirankar, before which the Sikhs bow down, but the worship of religious texts is also against the basic principles of Sikhs
 sikhamat main har jeev ko avatar kaha gaya he
 Every living being is part of that nirankar
 sansar main koi bhi panchi, pashu, ped, itiyadi avatar hai
 In the cunt of Manush, the creature has descended to complete his knowledge
 vyakti kii puja sikh dharm main nahin he "maanukh ki tech birthi sab jaanat, dene, ko eke bhagwaan"
 All avatars do not come full on the condition of a nirankar
 yahi kaaran he kii sikh kisi ko paramatior ke rup main nahin maanate
 Yes, if an avatar preaches Gurmat then Sikhs are definitely associated with that sermon
 jaisaa kii krishna ne gita main kaha he kii aatma marati nahin or jeev hatya kuch nahin hoti, is baat se to sikhamat sahamat he lekin aage krishna ne kaha he kii karm hi dharm he jis se sikh dharm sahamat nahin
 Prophet is one who spread the message or knowledge of Nirankar in the common folk
 jaisaa kii islam main kaha he kii mohammad aakhri paigambar he sikhon main kaha gaya he ki "har jug jug bhakt upaaya"
 Devotees are born equal and spread the message of Nirankar to the people
 sikhamat "laa elaha ill allaah " se sahamat he lekin sirf mohammad hi rasul allaah he is baat se sahamat nahin
 Arjun Dev ji says "dhur ki baani aayi, tein sagli chinta mittai", meaning that i have uttered a voice and my real concerns have disappeared that i have found it in whose eyes i was sitting
 mul rup main bhakton avam satguruon kii vaani kaa sangreh jo satguru arjuna dev ji ne kiya tha jise aadi granth kaha jaataa he sikhon ke dharmik granth ke rup main prasiddh he | yah granth 36 bhakton kaa sachaa upadesh he or ascharyajanak baat ye he kii 36 bhakton ne nirankaar ko sam drushti main vyaakhyaan kiya he | kisi shabd main koi bhinnata nahin he | sikh aadi granth ke saath saath dasam granth, jo kii satguru gobind singh ji kii vaani kaa sangreh he ko bhi maanate hai | yah granth khalse ke adheen he | par mul rup main aadi granth kaa gyaan lenaa hi sikhon ke liye sarvopriya he | Not only this, the Sikhs respect every scripture in which Gurmat is preached
 aadi granth yaa aadi guru granth yaa guru granth sahib yaa aadi guru darbar yaa pothee sahib, guru arjuna dev dawaara sangrihith ek dharmik granth he jisame 36 bhakton ke atmik jivan ke anubhav darj hai | aadi granth is liye kaha jaataa he kyonki isamen "aadi" kaa gyaan bharpoor he | jap bani ke mutabik "sach" hi aadi he | iskaa gyaan karwaane vaale granth ko aadi granth kehete hai | iske hawaale swayam aadi granth ke bheetar hai | halaaki vidwan tabaka kahata he kyonki ye granth main guru teg bahadur ji kii bani nahin thi is liye yah aadi granth he or satguru gobind singh ji ne 9wein mahale kii bani chadhaai is liye is aadi granth kii jaganh guru granth kaha jane laga | Satguru Arjun Dev ji was present in the form of speech books of devotees and Satgurus
 Bhai Gurdas Ji wrote this book and Satguru Arjun Dev became the guide
 He also recorded his speech in the book
 Many copies of this book were also prepared
 aadi granth ke 1430 panne khalsa dawaara maanakit kiye gaye | The Dasam Granth is a Sikh scripture which is a collection of the sacred words and compositions of Satgur Gobind Singh Ji
 guru gobind singh ji ne apane jeevankaal main anek rachanaayen kii jinaki choti choti pothiyaan bana deen
 After his death, on the orders of his religious wife Mata Sundari, Bhai Mani Singh Khalsa and other Khalsa brothers collected all the works of Guru Gobind Singh ji and put it in a book which is today called "dasam Granth"
 sidhe shabdon main kaha jaye to guru gobind singh ji ne rachana kii or khalse ne sampadanaa kii
 The entire Sikh community is entertained by the Dasam Granth
 dasam granth kii vaaniyaan jaise kii jaap sahib, tav parasaad savaiye or chopai sahib sikhon ke rojaanaa sajadaa, nitnem, kaa hissaa he or yah vaaniyaan khande bate kii pahole, jis ko aam bhashaa main amrit chakna kehete hai, ko banaate vakt padhi jaati hai
 In the gurudwaras of Takhat Hazur Sahib, Takhat Patna Sahib and Nihang Singh, the Dasam Granth is lighted with Guru Granth Sahib and is also taken daily
 sarbloh granth ore bhai gurdas kii vaaren shankaa grast rachanaae hai | halaaki khalsa mahima sarbloh granth main susajit he jo satguru gobind singh kii pramanit rachana he, baaki srbloh granth main karm cond, vyakti puja itiyadi vishe mojood hai jo sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf hai | bhai gurdas kii vaaron main murti puja, karm sidhaant adik gurmat viruddh shabd darj hai No historical source is considered complete for the history of Sikhism
 Sri Guru Sobha has assumed such a book which has been written by a Sikh near Gobind Singh but dates are not given in it
 There are other historical texts of Sikhs such as Shri Guru Pratap Suraj Granth, Gurbilas Patshahi 10, Shri Gur Sobha, Manhima Prakash and Panth Prakash, Janamsakhiya Itiyadi
 Sri Guru Pratap Suraj Granth is explained in Gurdwaras
 Once Gurbilas Patshahi was 10
 Most of the history has been written after 1750
 The scholars who wrote history were mostly Sanatani, due to which, in some historical books, Satguru and devotees have shown miraculous, which according to Gurmat philosophy is not right
 Guru Nanak flying in the air, riding a crocodile, Baba Budha's oblation of Mata Ganga is embodied in the historical events of Jamsakhis and Gurbilas and later historians have written these things by putting a spice on them
 No Satgur and devotee wrote their world history
 Satguru Gobind Singh has also written as much as he has written briefly and bluntly
 Sikhism does not give much importance to history, which is useful for understanding Sikhism as much as it is useful for Sikhism
 aaj sikh itihaas kaa shuddhikaran karne main lage hai
