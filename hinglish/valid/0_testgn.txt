 tolkin hai
 The novel is a continuation of three books, similar to one of Tolkien's previous works, The Hobbit
 in upanyaason kaa 2001, 2002 or 2003 main teen hollywood filmon main filmakan hua tha, jiske nideshak peter jackson hai
 All three films were hugely popular in Hollywood and won many Oscar awards
 is upanyaas kii kahani kaalpanik he
 Middle Earth is a fictional continent mentioned in this novel which is surrounded by seaside
 iske pashchim main ek or mahadweep he, jiskaa naam valinore he
 Valinor is the land of gods where humans cannot go
 kahani shuru hoti he madhya dharti main ek shaitan kaale rakshas se, jiskaa naam tha souron or jo kaale jaadu main maahir tha
 At the end of the first era, Sauron escapes defeat by the gods of his demonic boss Morgoth Melkor
 duusare yug main souron duniya kaa badshaah banane ke sapane sanjone lagata he
 For this, he went to the Gandharvas by making a beautiful disguise of the owner of the gifts, and made many magical rings by deceitfully luring the chiefs of their blacksmiths Kalembrimbor and other blacksmiths
 lekin rahasyamayi or gupt tareeke se usne swarna kii ek or anguthi swayan banaayi : wo ek anguthi 
 In this, he filled all the evil and magical power of the world
 wo ek anguthi baaki sabhi angoothiyon kii swamini thi or usko pahanane vaala baki sabhi anguthi pahanane waalon ko apana ghulaam bana saktaa tha
 This plan fails when the Gandharvas discover this deception and take off three rings they have made for themselves
 souron gandharvon ye yuddh karne baaki sari anguuthiyaan chin letaa he
 Sauron gave seven rings to the warlords of the dwarves and nine to the warlords of humans
 gandharvon ne apni teen anguuthiyaan bachaa kar chupa leen
 Dwarves were not particularly affected by rings due to their internal magic, but humans were affected
 anguthi pahanane vaale nau insaan kuch hi saalon main shaitani pret ban gayi or ant tak souron ke vafaadaar naukar bane rahe
 r-farajoun, the king of the island of Numanor, comes to take possession of Middle Earth and takes Sauron captive to Numanor
 ulte vahaan souron raja ko phusalaakar use dushtataa ke raste le jaataa he or numenore dweep or lagbhag sabhi numenoravasiyon kaa sarvanaash kara detaa he
 Some good Noomanori humans escape to the middle ground and settle in a new civilization: the Kingdom of Gondor
 idhar amar souron ek doosraa rup lekar vaapis madhya bhoomi pahunchataa he, baaki numenoriyon ko khatm karne
 At this time Gandharva and humans form a friendship organization and together defeat Sauron and his army of demons
 numenoriyon kaa yuvaraj isildur alendil apane mrit pita kii tuuti hui talvaar narsil se souron kii ungali katkar usase wo ek anguthi chin letaa he or souron kaa jismani vajood khatm kar detaa he
 Sauron's spirit runs away elsewhere
 is tarah tisare yug kii shuruyaat hoti he
 Now it was the duty of Isildur, the new king of the Numenorois, to put that one ring in the burning lava in the mountain of destruction, which was a volcano, because there was no other way to destroy this evil ring and its master
 lekin us ek anguthi kii apni ek jaadui chahat thi, kisi tarah apane swami souron ke paas vaapis jane kii
 With the effect of that magic ring, Isildur did not destroy it but kept it with him
 baad main kuch daityon ne use maar daalaa or uskaa shav nadi main gira diya
 In this way, that devilish ring was lost in water, for a whole era
 ye sari kahani zyaadaatar da silmerilon upanyaas main zikr he
 The Hobbit novel describes a human-like race called the Hobbit
 hobit shantipriy nanhen insaan hote the, lagbhag bunon ke kad jitne
 Once upon a time, she gets a ring in the hands of an excluded hobbit named Gollum
 gollum ko wo shaitani anguthi ek pagal, bhadde or dusht jaanavar-numa jeev main tabadil kar detii he
 Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, somehow gets that demonic ring from Gollum during his exciting journey
 bilbo ke budhaape se da lord of da rings upanyaas kii kahani shuru hoti he
 That satanic ring was not a root or unconscious thing, but it had a desire for itself, a desire
 anguthi apana alpakaalik swami khud hi chunati thi, jisase ki wo apane sahi maalik souron ke paas vaapis pahunch sake
 If anyone wore that ring in their finger, it would disappear from the eyes of the world
 kuch vaqt baad souron pretatma ke rup main vaapis mordor kii shaitani minar barad-dur main vaapis aa gaya
 He took the form of a huge eye, surrounded by fire and always looking for that ring
 agar koi vyakti wo ek anguthi pahane to ye talash tej ho jaati thi or pahanevaale kaa ata-pataa souron ko kuch-kuch mahasoos hone lagata tha
 If there was a Nazgul nearby at that time, he would immediately know the ring wearer
 anguthi ko pahanane vaala to jaise use pahanakar kisi duusari hi dhundhali duniya main pahunch jaataa tha
 That person used to look dull, but hearing power was very fast
 kabhi kabhi aise halaat main souron or pahananevaale ko ek duusare kii jhalak bhi dikh jaati thi
 Moreover, the ring bearer used to get addicted to this ring and he got a strange bond with this ring
 wo anguthi shuddh sone kii bani thi or usamen koi ratna nahin judaa tha
 Mordor's diabolical language in his inner merger wrote: da lord of da rings--da fallowship of da ring is silsile kii pehali kadi thi
 The protagonist of this series is Frodo Baggins, a hobbit from a small village named Shire
 frodo bilbo bagins kaa bhatija tha
 Note that while introducing his genius, Tolkien not only composed an entire mythological saga, but also composed at least two new Kritrim languages: especially the classical language of the Gandharvas, the Quenya and their lingua sindarin
 dono bhashaaon ke kai shabd or vakya puure upanyaas main angrezi ke bich chhitare hue hai
 1
 First chapter jab bilbo ne apni 111veen saalagirah par sanyas lene kii thaanee, to wo ek anguthi usne frodo ko baaki zaaydaad ke saath visasat main de di
 At that time, one of the many magicians, the old magician Gandalf, suspected that the gold ring was a lost satanic ring
 gandalf kaa shaq sahi niklaa
 At the same time Sauron came to know from Gollum that the ring was in the Poet
 souron ne turant nau bhayanak nazgul shaayar ko ravaanaa kiye
 On the other hand, Gandalf gave Frodo and his friend Sam Gamzy the responsibility of taking the ring out of the shire and taking it to Revendale, where the king of one of the Gandharva community lived, Alrond
 raste main frodo or sam ko unke rishtedaar meriadock brandybak or peregrin tuk bhi unke saath ho liye
 Gandalf did not meet them in the nearby city, as he had promised
 par vahaan frodo ko bache-khuche numenoriyon kaa sardaar aragorn zarur mila, jisane unki kaafii madad kii
 On the way to Rivendale, the Nazguls attack Frodo on the Weathertop Hill, and upon not giving the ring, Nazrul Sardar Angmar's dynasty injures Frodo with a poisonous magical talwar
 ek anya gandharv kii madad se frodo revendel pahunchaa jahaan uskaa ilaaj hua
 2
 Second Chapter udhar gandailf jaaduugaron ke sardaar saruman da hwite se anguthi ke bare main salaah lene isenguard main orthank kii minar main gaya
 In his own naivety, Saruman told all the truth
 lekin saruman ke dil main shaitaniyat or laalach bhar chuki thi
 He imprisons Gandalf on top of the tower and begins to form his own army of demons - Uruk Hai, who is not affected by daylight
 gandai orthank se bhaag nikal kar revendel pahunchaa
 At Rivendale, Elrond convened a council consisting of representatives of all the free breeds of Middle Earth
 vahaan frodo kii shuruyaat par ye faisalaa sunaaya gaya ki frodo angoothivahak banegaa or es ek anguthi ko mordor jaakar qayamat ke pahaad main lave ke dariye main phenk degaa, jisase anguthi or souron nestanabood ho jaayen
 The friendship of the ring was made for all of these, including: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas and Gimli
 maitri ne karadhras parvat shikhar ke darre se mordor kii taraf nikalne kii koshish kii, lekin chetanayukta karadhras ne unako rasta nahin diya 
 With no other road to friendship, he had to change the course and go through the mine of Moriya
 vahaan ek kaale agnidanav ballrog se ladate hue gandai khan kii gaharaiyon main gir gaya
 From there, this friendship went to another city of Gandharvas: Lothalorian, where Frodo saw some glimpses of his difficult future in the mirror of Gandharvarani Galadriel
 iske baad mahanadi anduin main naavon ke zariye ye log gondor kii seemaa main chale gayi
 There they had a terrible war with the uruk-haayis of Saruman in which Boromir was killed
 frodo ne khud se ye tay kiya ki ab vahi is anguthi ko mordor tak le ja saktaa he or use ye raah akele hi chalani hogi
 However, both Frodo and Sam set out on Mordor on Sam's vow

 pehla adhyay : isenguard kii gaddari The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is the second episode of this sequence
 silsile kii madhya kadi hone kii vajah se isaki kahani ekaek hi shuru hoti he, bina kisi chiz kii jaan-pahchaan diye or ekaek hi khatm bhi ho jaati he
 The story revolves around the friendship between Sauron's black tower Barad-far and Saruman's black tower Orthank
 daityon dwaara pakade gayi dono hobit meri or pippin sabhi daityon main hui ek jhadap kaa faaydaa uthaakar phangorn jangal ke andar bhaag jate hai
 There they find human tree ants
 int pedo ke charvaahe the or unako is baat kaa bahut rosh tha ki saruman pedo ko katkar apni bhattiyon ke liye indhan kaa bandobast kar rahaa he
 Mary and Pippin Anto's chief convince the treebeard and the other ants that they too should help in the fight against Saruman
 aragorn, gimli bouna or gandharv legolas meri or pippin kii khoj karte-karte rohan ke sultanate main pahonchte hai, jahaan rohan ke ghudsavaar unako bataate hai ki unhone pichhali raat daityon ke ek samooh se yuddh kiya tha or kisi ko bhi zindaa nahin baksha
 But Aragorn continues his search for Mary and Pippin, and Fangorn walks into the forest
 vahaan unako ek jaadugar miltaa he, jise pehle to wo log saruman samajhate hai, par baad main unhen gyaan hota he ki wo gandailf he, jo ki moriya kii khadaan se ballrog ko haraakar or phir punerjeevit hokar vaapis aayaa he
 From there, the four depart towards the capital of the Sultanate of Rohan
 rohan ke aadhe-pagal ho chuke raja theoden ko gandailf thik karata he or uske dusht salaahkaar greema kentuazbaan ko desh nikaala de diya jaataa he 
 Gandalf explains to Theodon that Saruman has an evil eye on his kingdom
 udhar saruman ne rohan par apni uruk-haai sena dwaara chadhaai kar di
 a fierce war ensues between the Uruk-hai and the Rohanites in the valley of Helm
 us samay gandailf aomer kii aadamiyon ko ikattha karne pahadiyon par chalaa jaataa he
 By dawn, the gandaif returns with all the men who have defeated the demons
 bhaagate hue daitya ek naye van main sharan lete hai, jo asal main anton dwaara laaye gayi huorn the
 All the monsters there are killed by the Hoorn
 iske baad badla lene theoden or anya log ek sena lekar orthank jate hai
 The Antons had taken possession of the Orthank, except the tower, and had submerged the river crossing and submerged it
 saruman kii dushtataa barkaraar rahane kii vajah se gandailf ne uski jaadui chadi tod di or use jaadugar shrenee se nikaal diya
 Saruman accidentally killed a Palantir on behalf of those whom Pippin caught
 jigyaasu hobit pippin ne jaadui palantir kaa upyog karte hue usamen chupake se nazar gadai
 There he got a glimpse of Sauron and his next move
 iske baad gandailf or pippin gondor kii sultanate kii ore ravaanaa ho gayi
 2
 Chapter 2: Travel to Mordor frodo or sam mordor kaa rasta kohre kii vajah se nahin dhund pate hai
 On the way, they find Golum, who was following them all the way
 anguthi ke peeche pagal gollum unase anguthi chhinane kii koshish karata he, lekin frodo or sam use pakad lete hai
 Sam wants to kill him, but Frodo craves him and makes him his guide, on the condition that Gollum will lead him to Mordor's gate and not try to snatch the ring
 kuch samay tak aisa prathit hota he ki gollum sahi main unka sachcha saathi ban gaya he
 On the other hand, the ring on Frodo's heartbeat and his desire to wear it was getting terrible
 wo un logon ko mordor ke mukhya phatak tak le jaataa he, par uske pehre ko paar kar paanaa namumkin sa tha
 Gollum tells Frodo that he can take them inside Mordor by another secret route

 For this reason, Sivagami speaks to Kattappa, his servant, that he is in trouble and has to kill Amarendra

 Then Katappa comes and informs Shivgami that Amarendra Bahubali has died
 devsena bhi apane bachche mahendra bahubali ke saath vahaan aati he or use bhi is bare main pataa chalata he
 Shivagami tells the bewildered crowd outside the palace that Amarendra is dead and now his son Mahendra Bahubali will be the new king
 iske baad bhallaal or uske log milakar devsena or uske bachche ko pakad kar karawas main daalane kii koshish karte hai

45 Manka Salempur Begusarai is a village in Begusarai, Bihar
 jain sahitya bahut vishaal he
 It is mostly religious literature
 sanskrit, praakrit or apbhransh bhashaaon main yah sahitya likhaa gaya he
 Magadha has been the center of Mahavira's tendencies, so he gave his sermon here in Ardhamagadhi, the lingua franca which is safe among the available Jain proceeds
 ye aagam 45 hai or inhen shwetambar jain pramaan maanate hai, digambar jain nahin
 According to the Dingbar, the Agama literature has been estranged from time immemorial
 digambar shatkhandgam ko sweekaar karte hai jo 12wein angadrushtiwad kaa ansh mana gaya he
 The language of ancient literature of Digambars is Shaurseni
 aage chalakar apbhransh tathaa apbhransh kii uttarkalin lok-bhashaaon main jain panditon ne apni rachanaayen likhakar bhashaa sahitya ko samrudh banaaya
 In the ancient literature, the texts of Jain literature are found in most number and most authentically
 jain rachanakaaron ne puraana kavy, charit kavy, katha kavy, raas kavy aadi vividh prakaar ke granth rache
 Swayambhu, Pushp Dant, Hemachandra, Somprabha Suri etc
 are the main Jain poets
 inhone hinduon main prachlit lok kathaon ko bhi apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or parampara se alag uski parinti apane matanukool dikhaai
 The oldest part of Jain literature is called 'agam'
 ye aagam 46 hai- The Agam Granth is quite ancient, and the place which is of Vedas in Vedic literature and of Tripitaka in Buddhist literature, the same place is of Agamas in Jain literature
 aagam granthon main mahavir ke upadeshon tathaa jain samskruti se sambandh rakhane vaali anek katha-kahaniyon kaa sankalan he
 According to Jain tradition, after 160 years of Mahavira Nirvana, there was a great downturn in Magadha countries, due to which the Jain monks had to relocate elsewhere
 dushkaal samaapt ho jane par shraman patliputra main ekatrit hue or yahan khand-khand karke gyaarah angon kaa sankalan kiya gaya, barahawaan ang kisi ko samaran nahin tha, isliye uskaa sankalan na kiya ja sakaa
 This conference is known as 'pataliputra-vachana'
 kuch samay pashchaat jab aagam sahitya kaa phir viched hone laga to mahavir nirvana ke 827 yaa 840 varsh baad jain saadhuon ke duusare sammelan hue
 One in Mathura under the chairmanship of Aryaskandil and the other under the chairmanship of Nagarjuna Suri
 mathura ke sammelan ko 'maathuri-vaachana' kii sangya di gayi he
 Then after about 150 years, 980 or 993 years after Mahavira Nirvana, the fourth conference of sadhus was held in Vallabhi under the chairmanship of Devardhigini Apology, in which the proceeds were systematically compiled for the last time
 se 'valbhi-vaachana' ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 The present proceeds are the form of this concept
 jain aagmon kii ukt teen sankalanaaon ke itihaas se pataa lagata he ki samay-samay par aagam sahitya ko kaaphi kshati uthaani padi, or yah sahitya apane moulik rup main surakshit nahin rah sakaa
 This seems to be the reason that this literature is very less compared to the Buddhist literature, and it was probably due to the disorder in this literature that the Digambara sect refused to accept it
 isa ke purv lagbhag chauthi shatabdi se lagaakar isvi san paanchavi shatabdi tak kii bharatvarsh kii aarthik tathaa saamaajik dasha kaa chithran karne vaala yah sahitya anek drushtiyon se mahatva kaa he
 a detailed description of the ethos of Jain monks in texts like Ayarang, Suyagand, Uttarajhayana, Daswayaliya etc
, it corresponds very much to the Buddhist Dhammapada, Suttanipat and Mahabharata, etc
, and according to the statement of scholars like Dr
 Vintranese, that shramana
 - symbolizes poetry
 bhashaa or vishay aadi kii drushti se jain aagmon kaa yah bhaag sabase pracheen maaloom hota he
 In texts like Bhagwati Kalpasutra, Owaiah, Thanang, Nirayavali, Shramana gives a detailed description of Lord Mahavira, his Chariya, his teachings and the erstwhile king, prince and his war, which reveal many of the endangered practices of Jain history
 nayadhammakaha, uwasgadasa, antgavadasa, anuttarovaviyadasa, vivagasuy aadi granthon main mahavir dwaara kahi hui anek katha-kahaniyaan tathaa unki shishy-shishyaaon kaa varnan he, jisamen jain parampara sambandhi anek baton kaa parichay miltaa he
 Many important topics related to Vaastu Shastra, music, flora, etc
 are described in the texts like Raipanesya, Jeevabhigam, Pannavana, which is not available elsewhere
 chhedsutron main saadhuon ke aahaar-vihaar tathaa praayshchit aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisaki tulana baudhon ke vinayapitak se kii sakati he
 It is told in the Vrhatkalpasutra that when Mahavira Saket was a monk in a garden called Subhumibhaga, at that time he allowed his monks and nuns to visit the monastery in the east of Saket, up to Kaushambi of Daksai, and to Kunala in the north
 isse pataa lagata he ki armbh main jain dharm kaa prachaar simit tha, tathaa jain shraman magadh or uttar pradesh ke kuch hisson ko chhodkar anyatra nahin ja sakate the
 Of course, this part of the Holesutras is as ancient as Mahavira himself
 tatpashchaat raja kanishka ke samakaleen mathura ke jain shilalekhon main bhinn-bhinn gana, kul or shakhaon kaa ullekh he, vah bhadravahu ke kalpasutra main varnit gana, kul or shakhaon ke saath praayah mail khaataa he
 This also reveals the authenticity of Jain scriptures
 vastutah is samay tak jain parampara main shwetambar or digambar kaa bhed nahin maaloom hota
 The resemblance of Pali Tripitaka in the subject, language etc
 of Jain proceeds also reflects the antiquity of this literature
 pali-sutron kii attakathaon kii tarah aagmon kii bhi anek tikaa-tippaniyan, deepika, nivritti, vivaran, avchuri aadi likhi gayi hai
 This literature can be divided into four divisions, namely, Nirukti, Bhashya, Churni and Tika, combining Agam and it is called 'panchangi'
 aagam sahitya kii tarah yah sahitya bhi bahut mahatva kaa he
 In this, the subject of Agams is given in detail
 is sahitya main anek anushrutiyaan surakshit hai, jo aitihaasik drushti se atyant mahatvapurn hai
 There is a wide variety of archaeological material in the commentaries, such as large-scale, practical, practical, nihilakrini, essentials, essentials, Uttarayana tika, etc
, due to which India’s customs, fair festivals, monks, cults, times, floods, thieves, robbers, sartwahs, trade The routes, crafts, art, food, houses, jewelery, etc
, throw a lot of light on various subjects
 lok-katha or bhashaa shaastra kii drushti se bhi yah sahitya bahut mahatva kaa he
