 Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin was one of the Russian-language poetical poets who is considered the best poet of Russian
 unhen aadhunik roosi kavita kaa sansthaapak bhi mana jaataa he
 We can understand Pushkin's short life span of 38 years by dividing it into 5 sections
 26 may 1799 ko unke janm se 1820 tak kaa samay balykaal or praarambhik sahitya rachana ko sametataa he
 The period from 1820 to 1824 is the exile period
 1824 se 1826 ke bich ve mikhayelovscoye main rahe
 He reached the peak of fame in 1826–1831, approaching the Tsar
 1831 se unki mrityu tak kaa kaal unke liye bada duhkhadaayi rahaa
 At the age of twelve, Pushkin was sent to study at Tsarskoyeselow's boarding school
 san 1817 main pushkin padhai puri kar saint petersburg aa gaye or videsh mantralay ke kaaryon ke atirikt unka sara samay kavita karne or mouj udaane main beetaa, isi dauraan sena ke noujvaan afasaron dwaara banaai gai saahitiyik sanstha greenlamp main bhi unhone janaa shuru kar diya tha, jahaan unki kavita kaa swaagat hua
 Using the freedom to express his views in a free environment, Pushkin wrote poems like Odd to Liberty, Chadayev and in the country
 dakshin main yekaterinoslav, kakeshas or kreemia kii apni yatraaon ke dauraan unhone khub padhaa or khub likhaa, isi bich ve biimaar bhi pade or general rayevski ke parivaar ke saath kakeshas or kreemia gaye
 This journey became memorable in Pushkin's life
 kakeshas kii khubasurat vaadiyon main ve romantic kavi byran kii kavita se parichit hue
 In 1823, he was sent to Odessa
 oddesa main jin do striyon se unki najdikiyaan raheen unamem ek thi ek sarb vyapaaree kii italian patni emilia rigenich or duusari thi praant ke governor general kii patni countes vorontsov
 These two women made a deep impression in Pushkin's life
 pushkin ne bhi donon se samaan bhav se prem kiya or apni kavitaayen bhi unhen samarpit kin
 But on the other hand, the increased proximity to the Countess was not in his interest
 unhen apni maan kii jaagir mikhayelovscoye main nirvasit kar diya gaya
 In the two years that Pushkin spent in this remote northern corner of Russia, he was mostly alone
 par yahi samay tha jab unhone yevgeni anegin or boris godunov jaisi vikhyath rachanaayen puri kin tathaa anek sundar kavitaayen likhin
 Finally, in 1826, at the age of 27, Pushkin was recalled from exile by Tsar Nicholas to St
 Petersburg
 mulaakaat ke dauraan jaar ne pushkin se us kathith shadyantr kii babat poocha bhi jisaki badaulat unhen nirvaasan bhogana padaa tha
 He remained suspicious in the eyes of power and his creations had to fall prey to the censors, but Pushkin's love for freedom always persisted
 san 1828 main masco main ek nrity ke dauraan pushkin kii bhent nathalya goncharova se hui
 In the spring of 1829 he proposed marriage to Natalya
 anek baadhaon ke baavjood san 1831 main pushkin kaa vivaah nathalya ke saath ho gaya
 Pushkin's married life was not happy
 isaki jhalak unke likhe patron main milti he, pushkin kaa takaraav nathalya goncharova ke ek diwane francisi da'antes se hua jo jaar nicholas kaa darbari tha
 It is said that d'antes had fallen in love with Natalya
 da'antes ne nathalya kii bahan catherine se vivaah kaa prastaav rakhaa
 He and Natalya then met in hiding, and the conditions worsened
 yah pushkin ko sahan nahin hui or vah da'antes ko dwandv yuddh kaa nimantran de baitha
 In a duel war on 27 January 1837, Pushkin was badly wounded by d'antes' bullets and died two days later on 29 January 1837 at the age of 38

 jis dhang se shikshak shikshaarthi ko gyaan pradaan karata he use shikshan vidhi kehete hai
 The term "teaching method" is used in a very wide sense
 ek ore to iske antargat anek pranaliyaan evam yojanaayen sammilit kii jaati hai, duusari ore shikshan kii bahut si prakriyaayein bhi sammilit kar lee jaati hai
 Sometimes people accept tips as a method; But it is a mistake to do so
 yuktiyaan kisi vidhi kaa ang ho sakati hai, sampurna vidhi nahin
 The same device can be used in many methods
 paathyavishay ko prastut karne ke do dhang ho sakate hai
 In one, students are given several examples to test or confirm a general principle
 duusare main pehle anek udhaaharan dekar chaatro se koi saamaanya niyam nikalvaaya jaataa he
 The first method is called deductive method and the second method is inductive method
 ye vidhi vyakaran shikshan ke liye sabase upyukt maani jaati he
 From the other point of view there can be two other types of teaching method
 pathyavastu ko upasthit karne kaa dhang yadi aisa hai ki pehle angon kaa gyaan dekar tab purna vastu kaa gyaan karaayaa jaataa he to use sanshleshnatmak vidhi kehete hai
 For example, in teaching Hindi, first the alphabet is taught and then words are taught
 tatpashchaat shabdon se vaakya banawaye jate hai
 But if the first sentence is taught and then the word and the letter are taught at the end, it will be called analytical method because it moves from the complete to the organs
 shikshan kaa ek prasiddh sutara hai - "moort se amoort kii ore"
 In fact, we have knowledge of the outer world through our senses, in which the eyes are prominent
 kisi vastu par drushti padate hi hamen uskaa saamaanya parichay mil jaataa he
 Therefore, tangible object is the simplest means of imparting knowledge
 isiliye aarambh se vastuvidhi kaa sahaara liya jaataa he arthath bacchon ko padhaane ke liye vastuon kaa pradarshan karke unke vishay main gyaan pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Even the abstract is tried to be made tangible
 jaise, teen or do paanch ko samajhane ke liye pehle chaatro ke sammukh teen goliyaan rakhi jaati hai
 Then two tablets are mixed together and all are counted together, then three and two five become clear
 vastuvidhi kaa ek doosraa rup he - drushtaantvidhi
 The way in which knowledge is imparted by objects, in parables is the same as in parables
 drushtaant drishy bhi ho sakate hai or shravy bhi
 In this, the object is clarified with the help of pictures, maps, paintings, etc
 saath hi upama, udhaaharan, kahani, chutkule aadi ke dwaara bhi vishay kaa spashtikaran ho saktaa he
 When children gain knowledge from object and parables, when children get the practice of making some guesses and also understanding the indirect object, then the narration method is taken
 isamen varnan ke dwaara chaatro ko pathyavastu kaa gyaan diya jaataa he
 But in this method, students remain mostly passive listeners and reading is not effective
 isi se prasiddh shikshashasthri herbert spencer ne kaha he- "bacchon ko kam se kam batalaana chahie, unhen adhik se adhik swat: gyaan dwaara siikhnaa chahie"
 Lecture method is its companion
 ucch kakshaon main praaia: vyaakhyanvidhi kaa hi prayog laabhadaayak samajha jaataa he
 Herbert's five steps are often used in narration
 ve hai But only five steps are used only in learning lessons
 kaushal tathaa rasaswadan ke paathon main kuch simit sopanon kaa hi prayog hota he
 Although the question is a tactic, Socrates has given more importance to it by using the Q&A as a method
 isi se ise sukaraati vidhi kehete hai
 In this, questions are asked from the questioner itself, and based on his answers, the required answers are obtained by questioning him
 jab se bal manovigyaan ke vikaas ne yah siddh kar diya he ki shiksha kaa centre na to vishay he, na adhyaaapak, varan chaatr he, tab se shikshan main sakriyata ko adhik mahatv diya jane laga he
 Learning by doing, that is, acquiring knowledge through self-experience, is the most widespread teaching doctrine of the day
 at: ruson se lekar maantesri or dubi tak shikshashastriyon ne bacchon kii gyanendriyon ko adhik kaaryshil banane tathaa unke dwaara shiksha dene par adhik bal diya he
 Mahatma Gandhi also gave birth to basic education on the basis of this principle
 at: sakriy vidhi ke antargat anek vidhiyaan sammilit kii ja sakati hai jaise- shodhvidhi, yojana vidhi, dalton pranali, basic-shiksha-vidhi, ityadi
 The research was conducted by Professor Armstrong in Germany
 is vidhi main chaatro ko upyukt vaataavaran main rakhkar swayan kisi tathy ko dhudhane ke liye prerit kiya jaataa he
 This does not mean that the teacher does nothing and leaves the students to do arbitrary work
 sach puuchhie to vah chaatr kaa pathpradarshan karata tathaa use galat raste se hataakar sidhe raste par laata rahata he
 Its goal is that the knowledge that a student can acquire through his observation or experiment is not told
 is vidhi kaa prayog pehle to vigyaan kii shiksha main kiya gaya
 Then gradually it started being used in mathematics, geography and other subjects as well
 america ke prasiddh shikshashasthri duvi, kilpatric, steevenson aadi ke sammilit prayaas kaa fal yojana vidhi he
 According to this, natural environment is more suitable for enlightenment
 is vidhi se padhaane ke liye pehle koi samasya lee jaati he, jo praaia: chaatro ke dwaara uthaai jaati he or us samasya kaa hal karne ke liye unheen ke dwaara yojana banaai jaati he or yojana ko swaabhaavik vaataavaran main purna kiya jaataa he
 From this, its definition is made in such a way that planning is a problematic task that should be completed in a natural environment
 america ke dalton naamak sthaan main 1912 se 1915 ke bich kumari hellen parkharstr ne shiksha kii ek nai vidhi prayukt kii jise dalton yojana kehete hai
 This method was invented to overcome the defects of classroom education
 dalton yojana main kakshabhawan kaa sthaan prayogshaala le leti he
 There is a laboratory for each subject, in which books, pictures, maps and other material for the study of that subject have additional references
 vishay kaa visheshgy adhyaaapak prayogshaala main baithkar chaatro kii sahaayta karata he, unke kaaryon kii jaanch tathaa sanshodhan karata he
 The work of the year is divided into 9 or 10 parts, written as written assignments to each student
 chaatr us nirdhaarit kaary ko apni ruchi ke anusaar vibhinn prayogshaalaon main jaakar puraa karata he
 Work is divided among inventions
 jitani anviti kaa kaary puraa ho jaataa he utani kaa ullekh uske rekhapatr par kiya jaataa he
 The scheduled work of the second month is given only after the work of one month is completed
 is prakaar chaatr kii unnati uske kiye hue kaary par nirbhar rahati he
 In this scheme, students are allowed to work according to their interest and convenience
 mul sroton se adhyayan karne ke kaaran unamem swaavlamban bhi aa jaataa he
 There have been many variations of this scheme like schemes like Batavia, Vinetka etc
 decrauli yojana yadhyapi isse purv kii he, phir bhi uske siddhanton main dalton yojana ke aadhaar par parivartan kiye gaye
 Mahatma Gandhi's Wardha Scheme or Basic Education is also an education system of its kind
 gandhi ji ne desh kii tatkaaleen sthiti ko dekhte hue shiksha main 'haath ke kaam' ko pradhanta di
 He believed that the student would not know the importance of labor until he worked by hand
 saidhantik gyaan manushya ko ahamkaari evam niskriy bana detaa he
 Therefore, children should be taught from the very beginning through some form of manipulation
 hamaare desh main krishi evam katai-bunai buniyadi dhandhe hai jinamein desh kii teen chauthai janata lagi hui he
 Therefore, he considered both of them to be original handicrafts and gave them a prominent place in education
 basic shiksha kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai :- The last doctrine was strongly opposed and removed from basic education
 angreji shiksha ne desh ke adhikansh shikshit varg ko aisa pangu bana diya he ki ve haath se kaam karnaa hey maanate hai
 This is the reason that the affluent and upper class people showed indifference towards basic education, due to which this education has remained only for the poor
 at: yah dhire-dhire asafal hoti ja rahi he
 From the above discussion it is clear that the teaching methods are many
 sabakaa pravartan kisi na kisi vishesh paristhiti main kisi shikshashasthri ke dwaara hua he
 In fact, every teacher has his own education system and imparts knowledge to the students according to their interest and ability
 jo vidhi jiske liye adhik upyogi ho vahi uske liye sarvshereshth vidhi he

 From left saanchaa:tamilnadu main shikshasaanchaa:bharat main shiksha With the help of gases, the action of weldon is the same, but they are divided according to the gas in use
 ye gaisen bahudhaa oxigen or asitilin kaa mishran, kol gas or hydrogen aadi hua karti hai
 Of these, oxy-acetylene weldens are the most common
 veldonopayogi gaisen taiyaar karanevaali vyapaarik companiyaan ispaat ke majboot silinderon main gas ko kai vayumandalon ke dabaav par bharkar weldon ke liye bechaa karti hai
 This gas is produced at low pressures by mixing with calcium carbide and water by private gas generators in Weldon's large factories
 asitilin ko asitone main ghulaa dene se use visphoton kaa dar nahin rahata
 Regardless of the type of gas being treated, it is transported to the weldon by some kind of blower, with the help of a valve attached to which the flow of the gas is controlled and a flame of the appropriate size is created
 is
 chitra 4
 kii akruti k main phunkani ke munh par laganevaali ek chhucchhi kii banaavat dikhaai gai he or kha main lau kii akruti he
 To make the flame smaller, larger, thinner or thicker, jets of various sizes are interchangeably applied on the blower
 jet kii maap arthath uski takat prati ghanta gas ke kharche ke anusaar nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 The smallest jet consumes one cubic foot of gas in an hour and the largest jet consumes about 200 cubic feet of gas and the gas pressure is kept at 2 to 8 pounds per square inch
 prayog karte samay asitilin gas ko pehle kholkar jet ke munh par use jala diya jaataa he, phir oxigen ke silinder kaa balve dhire-dhire itnaa kholaa jaataa he ki jisase uchit prakaar kii lau ban jaae
 Due to excess acetylene in the mixture of burning gas, its flame becomes slightly thicker by carbureting, but it remains as bright as bright from beginning to end
 yadi mishran main oxigen kii adhikta ho, to lau oxikaarak prabhaav se yukt ho jaati he or uskaa sound lanbaa tathaa chamakdaar ho jaataa he, lekin donon prakaar kii gaison kii maatra main uchit samaayojan kar dene se jo lau banati he uske sound kaa chamakdaar bhaag chota or spasht akritiyukt hota he or usee kii nonk par sabase adhi taap hota he, jaisaa chitra 4
 main dikhaaya gaya he
 Therefore, the flame is kept about 1 / 8 inch to 1 / 16 inch away from the metal surface to melt the metal while welding
 weldon karte samay weldon kii janevaali vastuon ke takkaron ko milakar, upar se gas kii lau dwaara unako jod par galaa diya jaataa he jisase donon pruthak bhaagon kii dhaatuen apaas main galaakar mil jaati he or saath hi saath usee prakaar kii kuch phaltu dhaatu, jo patali battiyon ke rup main hoti he tathaa jise poorak yaa batti bhi kehete hai, galaakar bhar di jaati he or in sabake thandha ho jane par thos sandhi ban jaati he
 There are two tricks to blow a blower, one is the left hand and the other is the right hand
 baayein haath kii kriya main weldon kaa kaam dahini ore se bai ore ko badhata he jisase lau bina jhale hue bhaag kii taraf jhuki rahati he or phunkani ko daahine haath se thamkar batti ko baayein haath se thama jaataa he
 While welding, the blow makes an angle of 60 to 70 degrees and the metal light 30 to 40 degrees from the object to be welded
 daahine haath kii kriya main lau kaa munh jhale hue bhaag kii ore jhukaa rahata he or jhalaai kii kriya bai ore se dahini ore ko badhati he
 While belding with the left hand, the blow is run like a wave of water, and in the right hand weldon, the blow is run very rarely or not at all, but by turning the light into the shape of round rings
 batti kaa vyas veld kii janevaali vastu kii motaai or phunkani kii naap ke anupaat se hona chahie
 The thin light itself will melt quickly and the welded joint will not be able to get hot and melted
 yadi batti adhik moti hogi, to vah swayan der se galegi or vastu ke pehle se gale hue bhaagon ko jaldi se thanda kar degi
 The custom of this type of blowing is increasing nowadays
 isamen do lau ek saath nikalati hai, agevali lau to dhaatu ko agaau garam karne kaa kaam karti he, jisamen thodi adhik asitilin kharch ho jaati he lekin laabh yah hota he ki va carburikar hokar platon ko oxikaran hone se bachaa leti he, kyonki us samay platon main carbon kaa avasorana ho jane se unka dravnank ghat jaataa he or pichhali choti lau vahaan pahonchte hi saralata se apana kaam kar leti he
 This type of flame also reduces the defects of welding and twisting in the parts to be welding, and the welding work also happens quickly

 vah poloroid instent camera ke photographs evam chirsthayee tatuge ke jariye hatya kaa badla lene kii koshish karata he
 Aamir Khan's character will get a special place in a 3-D video game titled Ghajini the Game, which is based on this film
 is film kii kahani medical chaatra sunita or uski sahpathine jo uske saath maanav-mastishk kii ek pariyojna par kaam kar raheen hai, se khulti he
 He wants to investigate the unique condition of Sanjay Singhania, the city's designated trader who suffers from post-operative memory loss
 uske professor sanjay ke abhilekhan tak abhigaman se asweekaar kar dete hai kyonki vartmaan main uske saare aapraadhik tathyon kii jaanch jari he
 Despite this, Sunita decides to conduct the investigation herself
 sanjay ko ek duusare vyakti kii krurta se hatya karata hua pesh kiya jaataa he
 He takes a picture of the person and places the 'executed' seal in his note with the time and date
 aisa darshaya gaya he ki sanjay ko ghatanottar smriti lop kii ek ajeebogareeb beemaari he jisamen uski yaaddaasht har 15 minute ke baad mit jaati he
 Sanjay uses the methods of tattooing, taking notes, and tattooing on his body to return his memory again after every 15-minute cycle
 har subah jab sanjay shauchalay jaataa he, vah vaash basin main nal kii tonti ke paas hi "kameez utaaro" likhaa hua ek note dekhtaa he
 As he takes off the shirt, he sees a series of tattoos on his wide chest
 jab vah "kalpana kii hatya kar di gai thi" guda hua dekhtaa he to ek sire se yah udghaatit ho jaataa he ki sanjay antat kalpana kii hatya kaa badla lene ke liye pra tibaddh he or isiilie vah pariklpit tareeke se ek-ek kar un logon ko maar rahaa he jo kalpana kii maut ke jimmedaar the
 The written notes and the pierced tattoos provide clear evidence that its main target is Ghajni
 aakhirkaar yah bhi saafe-saafe jaahir ho jaataa he ki gajani or koi nahin balki shahar kaa ek prasiddh saamaajik vyaktitv he
 Mumbai Police Inspector Arjun Yadav is involved in the investigation of the case related to serial murders
 vah sanjay kaa pataa lagaate hue use uske flats main khoj nikaalte hai or usapar hamalaa kar use apahiz kar dete hai
 Arjun Yadav is surprised to see the extensive set of photographs and written notes
 unhen aisi do diariyaan milteen hai jinamein 2005 or 2006 kii ghatnaon ko kram se lipibaddh kiya gaya he
 The film enters the pre-2005 scene as soon as Inspector Yadav reads the 2005 diary
 sanjay singhania ek pratishthit vyapaaree vansh kaa vyakti he jo air voyas telephone company kaa maalik he
 He has finished his education abroad and returned to take over his family business
 apane kaarobaar ke dauraan sanjay apane karmchaariyon ko ek jujharu abhinetri / model kalpana se milane evam uske apartment ke upar air voyas kaa vishaal vigyaapan board lagane ke bare main baatcheet karne ke liye bhejtaa he
 The owner of Kalpana's modeling / advertising company forgets to think of it as a romance affair and encourages Kalpana to accept the proposal
 vah pramukh model ke rup main uski padonnati kar detaa he
 Kalpana is usually sweet and kind
 vah ise bataur ek maasoom sharaarat karne ke liye sweekaar kar leti he or is prakaar sanjay ke garlfriend ke rup main paheliyon se bharaa naatakeey khel shuru karti he
 Sanjay finally meets Kalpana but he tells him that he is Sachin and is an Adana human who has come from a small town to a big city in search of new life
 kalpana use modling ke chote-mote kaam dilaati he
 Slowly she is drawn towards him in his hypnosis and Sachin also gets swept away in her mildness, simplicity and compassion
 unhen ek duusare se pyaar ho jaataa he or sanjay ko antat usase shaadi kaa prastaav pesh karne kii himmat ho jaati he
 She asks for some time to consider his proposal
 sanjay sthir karata he ki agar vah uske prastaav ko sweekaar kar leti he to vah apni asli pahchaan uske saamne ujagar kar degaa; or agar vah asweekaar karti he, to vah chupchaap bina koi haani pahunchaae waapas laut jayega
 The film's story then returns to the present; When Yadav starts reading the 2006 diary
 sanjay achaanak aa jaataa he, yadav par hamalaa kar detaa he or use baandh detaa he
 He discovers Ghazni at a college function where he is the honorable head guest
 sanjay gajani ke kuch chayachitr letaa he or use jaan se maar daalane kaa faisla karata he 
 usee samaaroh main uski mulaaqaat sunita se ho jaati he; vah bhi uske file par lage cover se use pahchaan leti he or usase dosti karne kaa iraadaa karti he
 Later that same evening, Sanjay kills a goon of Ghazni in the parking area
 vah gajani ke aane kaa intjaar karne lagata he lekin ant main usapar phir kabhi kisi or maukey par aakhri hamalaa karne kaa faisla karata he
 The dying injured Gunda reminds Ghazni of an incident that took place two years ago in which Kalpana was murdered and Sanjay became a patient after being hurt
 gajani asamanjas main pad jaataa he or kuch bhi yaad kar paane main naakaam ho jaataa he
 Meanwhile, Sunita comes to Sanjay's flat and finds Yadav beaten and tied
 use is baat kaa pataa bhi lag jaataa he ki gajani hi sanjay kaa nishaanaa he
 Yadav also informs him that Sanjay is a known serial killer
 sunita ke haathon do diariyaan lag jaatin hai or vah yadav ko aaazaad kar detii he
 Suddenly in the meantime Sanjay reaches there He does not remember any of them and walks out chasing them
 antatogatva yadav ek bas se takaraa jaataa he or sunita badi mushkil se sanakee sanjay se batch nikalati he
 Knowing that Ghajni is in danger, she informs him that it is Sanjay who is behind his life
 is naam ko lakshya banaakar pataa lagaataa hua gajani sanjay ke flats main uski hatya ke iraade se pahunch jaataa he
 He destroys all her photographs and notes and gets her goons overpowered by Sanjay and re-inducts her on her existing tattoo so that all the marks that mark old memories are erased
 All traces connecting with old memories of being restless have been erased, leaving Gajni Sanjay in this condition
 is bich, chatravaas main lautakar sunita 2006 kii diary padhati he
 The film's story then returns to the pre-2006 scene
 aisa dikhaaya jaataa he ki kalpana ne sanjay ke vivaah prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya tha
 This diary also ends abruptly
 sunita or aage chaanbin kar pataa lagaati he or yah khoj nikaalati he ki 2006 main kisi padaav par kalpana anjaane main anachaahe hi veshyavriti karwaane waalon ke bure jaal main ulajh gai thi
 During the train journey, he met 25 innocent Bholi Bhali Kamsin girls who were being sent to Mumbai for business
 vah un ladakiyon kii raksha kar unka uddhaar karti he
 But the girls take Ghajni's name as gang gangsters
 gajani apane tareeke se apane madhyamon kaa prayog ladakiyon kii jubaan band karne ke liye karata he or kalpana ko khud khoj nikalne ke liye nikal padataa he
 Ghazni and his goons sabotage into Kalpana's apartment and wait for her to return while Kalpana is found inside
 sanyogvash, sanjay vahaan kalpana se milane pahunch gaya
 Kalpana's last pronounced word was "ghajini"
 The goons attacked Kalpana
 sanjay hastkshep karne hi vaala tha ki achaanak gajani ne lohe kii chad se uske sir par aghat kar diya
 The final scene flashes in front of Sanjay's eyes, that Kalpana was killed by the brutal assault of Ghazni's iron rod
 sunita ko ab sadma vaali sachai kaa pataa chal jaataa he, vah sanjay se mulaaqaat karti he or use bataati he ki sach kya he
 Uncontrollable with anger, he pursues Ghazni zealously
 mumbai main gajani kii maand main pahunchakar sanjay gajani ke sabhi anuchar gurgon ko ek-ek kar baqayada suniyojit dhang se krurtapurvak maar daalata he or gajani ke peeche pil padataa he
 Furiously repulsed, he approaches her and confronts the fight
 vah gajani ko maarna hi chahta he ki uskaa smriti lop chakra phir gum jaataa he or vah vartmaan ko bhul jaataa he
 Ghazni turns and stabs him
 vah sanjay kaa mazaaq udaate hue vibhats ghinauni kahani sunaata he ki usne kaise kalpana kii hatya kii thi, tabhi achaanak apni takat kaa antim ubaal paakar sanjay gajani ko kaabo main kar letaa he
 Sanjay kills Ghazni in the same way that Ghajni murdered Kalpana
 film apni samaapti kii ore badhati he, sanjay abhi bhi apni smriti-lop kii beemaari se grasit ek anathalay main swanyasevak ke rup main kaam kar rahaa he
 Sunita gives him a small gift that marks Sanjay and Kalpana's footsteps on the plaster plate when they entered a new apartment - only to remind him of his intimate companionship with Kalpana

 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad ke kaal main sanyukt rajya america or soviet rus ke bich utpann tanaav kii sthiti ko sheet yuddh ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It has also been given the name of 'arms Faced Shanti' by some historians
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan sanyukt rajya america, britain or rus ne kandhe se kandha milakar dhuri rashtron- germany, italy or japan ke viruddh sangharsh kiya tha
 But as soon as the war ended, intense differences arose between Britain and the United States on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other
 bahut jald hi in matbhedon ne tanaav kii bhayankar sthiti utpann kar di
 Communist countries under the leadership of Russia and capitalist countries under the leadership of America were divided into two camps
 in donon pakshon main aapasi takaraahat aamane saamne kabhi nahin hui, par ye donon gut is prakaar kaa vaataavaran banaate rahe ki yuddh kaa khatra sadaa saamne dikhaai padataa rahata tha
 Berlin Crisis, Korea War, Molecular Testing by Soviet Russia, Military Organization, Indian China Problem, U-2 Plane Scandal, Cuban Missile Crisis were some of the circumstances which ignited the fire of Cold War
 san 1991 main soviet rus ke vighatan se uski shakti kam ho gayi or shityudh kii samaapti ho gayi
 As is clear from its name, it is not a war of arms and weapons but a war confined to threats
 is yuddh main koi vaastavik yuddh nahin ladaa gaya
 It was limited to indirect war only
 is yuddh main donon mahashaktiyon ne apane vaicharik matbhed hi pramukh rakhe
 It was a type of diplomatic war, which was based on the efforts of the narrow powers of the superpowers
 ke
pi
es
 minan ke anusaar - sheet yuddh do virdohi vichaardhaaraon - poonjeevaad or samrajyavad, do vyavasthaaon - burjua loktantr tathaa sarvhaara taanaashaahee, do guton - nato or varsa samjhauta, do rajyon - america or soviet sangh tathaa do netaaon - jon foster illaas tathaa stallin ke bich yuddh tha jiskaa prabhaav puure vishwa par padaa
 Thus it can be said that the Cold War was a speech war between two superpowers based on diplomatic measures
 yah donon mahashaktiyon ke madhya dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad utpann tanaav kii pratyaksh abhivyakti tha
 It was even more terrible than the actual war, being an ideological war
 shityudh ke lakshan dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan hi prakat hone lage the
 Both the superpowers were fighting the war keeping in mind their narrow interests and showing the spirit of mutual cooperation
 jo sahyog kii bhaavana yuddh ke dauraan dikhaai de rahi thi, vah yuddh ke baad samaapt hone lagi thi or shityudh ke lakshan spasht taur par ubharne lag gaye the, donon guton main hi ek duusare kii shikaayat karne kii bhaavana balwati ho gai thi
 There were some strong grounds for these complaints
 ye parsparik matbhed hi shityudh ke pramukh kaaran the, shityudh kii utpatti ke pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit hai- The Cold War developed slowly
 iske lakshan 1917 main hi prakat hone lage the jo dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad spasht taur par ubharkar vishwa rangamanch par aae
 The spirit of mutual fear and mistrust between the two powers contributed to its promotion
 donon mahashaktiyon dwaara ek duusare ke viruddh chali gai chaalon ne is shityudh ko sabal aadhaar pradaan kiya or ant main donon mahashaktiyaan khulkar ek duusare kii aalochana karne lagi or samast vishwa main bhay va ashaanti kaa vaataavaran taiyaar kar diya, iske badhaava dene main donon mahashaktiyaan baraabar kii bhagidaar rahi
 Its development sequence can be understood in the following steps - is samay ke dauraan shityudh kaa asli rup ubhara
 The differences between the US and the Soviet Union came to light
 is kaal main sheet yuddh ko badhaane dene vaali pramukh ghatnaayen nimnlikhit hai- During this time, there was a possibility of some changes in the behavior of both the superpowers
 is yug main donon deshon ke netritv main parivartan hua
 After Stalin's death in the Soviet Union, Khushchev took over the reins and President Eisen Haver took over the reins in the US
 soviet sangh kii taraf se donon deshon ke madhya madhur sambandh sthapit karne ke prayaas avashya hue lekin unka koi sakaaratmak parinaam nahin niklaa or america tathaa soviet sangh main sheet yuddh kaa tanaav jari rahaa
 During this time a few incidents occurred which gave impetus to the Cold War
 is prakaar is yug main sheet yuddh ko badhaava dene vaali kaarywahiyaan donon taraf se hui
 But both the superpowers also made some efforts towards reducing the tension of the Cold War
 khruschev ne donon deshon ke madhya sambandh madhur banane or tanaav kam karne ke liye 15 sitambar se 28 sitambar 1959 tak america kii yatra kii
 On 5 September 1963, there was a 'moscow Partial Trial Prohibition Treaty' between the US, Soviet Union and Britain
 isse sheet yuddh ko samaapt karne kaa sakaaratmak kadam kaha gaya
 The non-aligned Movement also tried to reduce the Cold War during this period, but the results of all these efforts remained negative and tension remained in both the superpowers
 1962 main cuba sankat ke baad sheet yuddh ke vaataavaran main kuch narmi ai or donon guton ke madhya vyaapt tanaav kii bhaavana sauhardpurn va mitrataa kii bhaavana main badalane ke asaar dikhaai dene lag gaye
 This started showing signs of the beginning of a sweet relationship between the two countries
 is narmi yaa tanaav main kami ko 'ditant' yaa 'tanavshithily' kii sangya di jaati he
 The tradition changed the landscape of the old international relations arising out of the Cold War and a peaceful atmosphere was born in the world
 isse sanyukt raashtra sangh kii bhoomika main bhi vruddhi hui or parmaanu yuddh ke aatank se chhutkaaraa mila
 The 1970s saw the transition to a new type of cold war as soon as the Afghanistan crisis was born
 is sankat ko 'ditant kii antim shavyatra' kaha jaataa he
 This brought an end to the tragedy, and the tension between the two powers that had lasted for almost a decade took days of diabolism and old tensions began to rise again
 isaki utpatti ke pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit hai All these reasons led to the birth of a new cold and the end of the tradition
 isse antarrashtriya sambandhon main nai khatas paidaa hui america ne khadi siddhanth ke dwaara vishwa shaanti ke liye khatra paidaa kar diya
 This new Cold War brought the world to the brink of World War III
 isse ditant kii haani hui or nishastreekaran ko gaharaa dhakka laga
 This made the centers of tension Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Nicaragua etc
 yah yuddh vichaardhaara virdohi na hokar soviet sangh virdohi tha
 Its agents were Britain, France and China, not just the US and Soviet Union
 is yuddh ne sampoorn vishwa kaa vaataavaran hi dooshit kar diya
 This gave rise to multipolarization and introduced new challenges in international relations
 shityudh ne 1946 se 1989 tak vibhinn charnon se guzarate hue alag-alag rup main vishwa raajnneeti ko prabhavit kiya
 This led to tensions between the US and the Soviet Union as well as other effects
 iske antarrashtriya sambandhon par nimnlikhit prabhaav pade- It can be said that the Cold War had a wide impact on international relations
 isane samast vishwa kaa do guton main vibhaajan karke vishwa main sangharsh kii pravriti ko badhaava diya
 It created a balance of terror in place of a balance of power
 lekin nakaaratmak prabhaavon ke saath-saath iske kuch sakaaratmak prabhaav bhi pade
 This paved the way for technical and technical development
 isse yathartwaadee raajnneeti kaa aavirbhaav hua or vishwa raajnneeti main nae rajyon kii bhoomika ko bhi mahatvapurn mana jane laga

 Notes: 1 as of 2015; 2 km2; 3 per km2 shamsuddin iltutamish dilli sultanate main ghulaam vansh kaa ek pramukh shaasha tha
 After the founder of the dynasty, Qutub-ud-din Aibak, he was among the rulers that strengthened the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate
 vah aibak kaa damaad bhi tha
 He ruled from 1211 AD to 1236 AD
 rajbhishek samay se hi anek turk amir uskaa virodh kar rahe the
 Impressed by Iltutmish's work efficiency against the Khokhars, Muhammad Ghori gave him an important position called "amirul Umra"
 aksmaat mutyu ke kaaran qutubaddeen aibak apane kisi uttaradhikari kaa chunaav nahin kar sakaa tha
 So the Ottoman authorities of Lahore put the disputed son Aramshah of Qutb-ud-din Aibak to the throne of Lahore, but as a result of the opposition of the Turko chieftains and citizens of Delhi, Iltutmish, son-in-law of Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who was then the Subedar of Badaun, was invited to Delhi on the throne
 Was seated aramshaah evam iltutamish ke bich dilli ke nikat jad naamak sthaan par sangharsh hua, jisamen aramshaah ko bandi banaakar baad main uski hatya kar di gayi or is tarah aibak vansh ke baad ilbaari vansh kaa shashan prarambh hua
 Iltutmish had two major rivals - Tajuddin Yaldauj and Nasiruddin Kubacha
 ye donon gauri ke das the
 Yaldauj considered the state of Delhi as a part of Ghazni and kept trying hard to merge it with Ghazni, while Aibak and then Iltutmish considered themselves independent
 yalduj ke saath tarin ke maidan main yuddh kiya jisamen yalduj parajeet hua
 After his defeat, no ruler of Ghazni asserted his claim to power in Delhi
 kubacha ne punjab tathaa uske aasapaas ke kshetron par apni sthiti majboot kar lee thi
 In 1217 he traveled against Kubacha
 kubacha bina yuddh kiye bhaag gaya
 Iltutmish followed him to a place called Mansura where he defeated Kubacha and captured Lahore
 par sindh, multan, uchh tathaa sindh sagar doaab par kubacha kaa niyantran bana rahaa
 At the same time, Iltutmish's attention was immediately diverted from Kubacha due to the Mongol invasion, but he later defeated Kubacha in a battle that resulted in Kubacha dying by drowning in the Indus River

 Between 1215 and 1217 AD, Iltutmish had to contend with two of his powerful rivals, 'aldauj' and 'nasiruddin Kabacha'
 1215 i
 main iltutimish ne aldauj ko tarin ke maidan main parajeet kiya
 In 1217 AD, Iltutmish seized Lahore from Kubacha and in 1228 seized Uchh and asked Kubacha to surrender unconditionally
 ant main kubacha ne sindhu nadi main kudakar aatmahatya kar lee
 In this way, both these powerful opponents came to an end

 In February 1229, Iltutmish received a 'khilayat' and a certificate in honor of the Caliph of Baghdad
 caliph ne iltutamish kii pushti un saare kshetron main kar di, jo usne jite the
 At the same time, the Khalifa also conferred upon him the title of 'sultan-e-azam'
 pramaan patr praapt hone ke baad iltutamish vaid sultan evam dilli sultanate ek vaid swatantra rajya ban gai
 This acceptance helped Iltutmish to inherit the rank of Sultan and secure the authority of his children on the throne of Delhi
 khirdt milane ke baad iltutamish ne ‘nasir amir ul mominin’ kii oopaadhi grahan kii
 Iltutmish was the first Ottoman sultan who introduced pure Arabic coins

 Iltutmish started the tradition of inscribing mint names on coins
 sikkon par iltutamish ne apana ullekh caliph ke pratinidhi ke rup main kiya he
 After the Gwalior conquest, Iltutmish inscribed some proud words on his coins, such as "mighty sultan", "empire and sun of religion", "helper of the hero of the righteous"
 iltutamish ne ‘ikta vyavastha’ kaa prachlan kiya or rajdhani ko lahore se dilli sthaanantarit kiya
 While on his way to invade Bayana, Iltutmish became ill

 doorsanchaar main adhimishran kaa istemaal sandesh bhejne ke liye hota he, lekin ek sangeetkaar swar-saamanjasy ke liye kisi vaadyayantra ke swar kii maatra, uskaa samay yaa timming or swaraghaat ko alag karne main iskaa upyog karata he
 Often high frequency sinusoid waveforms are used as carrier signals for low-frequency signals
 sin wave ke teen pramukh maapdand hai - uskaa apana aayam, uske charan or uski aavriti, ek modulated singnal praapt karne ke liye in sabhi sanchaar sanket ko kam frequency ke aadhaar par sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 The device which performs modulation is called modulator and the device which performs the opposite action is called demodulator
 jo upkaran donon hi tarah kaa kaary kar saktaa he vah modem kehalaata he 
 The purpose of digital modulation is to transfer digital bit streams to an analog passband channel, for example; Public switched telephone networks, or transfers over a limited radio frequency band
 anuroop adhimishran kaa uddeshy ek anuroop besaband sanket ko hastantarit karnaa he, udhaaharan ke liye ek audio sanket yaa tivi sanket ko ek anuroop pasband channel par hastantarit karnaa he, doosraa udhaaharan radio frequency band yaa cabel tivi network channel ko simit karnaa bhi he
 Analog and numerical modulation simplifies frequency division multiplexing, while simultaneously transferring multiple low-pass information signals via separate passband channels via a shared physical medium
 ankiy besaband adhimishran pranali, jo ki line koding kehalaata he, kaa uddeshy bhi ek ankiy bit stream par besaband channel ko, ek serial bas yaa taar dwaara jude local aria network jaise non filter-tambe ke taar ke jariye hastanantarit karnaa he
 The purpose of a pulse modulation system is to transfer a narrowband analog signal, for example a call call coming to a wideband baseband channel, or in some schemes the beat stream to another digital transmission system
 anuroop adhimishran main, anuroop information sanket par adhimishran lagaataar chalata rahata he
 Common analog modulation techniques are as follows: ankiy adhimishran main, anuroop vaahak sanket ek ankiy bit pravaah ke jariye adhimishrit hota he
 The digital modulation method can have digital-to-analog conversion and demodulation or detection can be analog-to-digital conversion
 vaahak sanket main parivartan m vikalp pratikon ke ek parimit sankhya se chune jate hai
 a common example: a telephone line is designed to transfer audible sound, for example take a tone, it is not numeric bits
 computer isiilie telephone main modem ke jariye sampark sthapit kar saktaa he, jo ankiy bits kaa pratinidhitiv tone, jise pratik kehete hai, ke dwaara karata hai
 If there are four choice symbols, the first symbol can represent bit sequence 00, similarly the second one on 01, the third 10 and the fourth 11
 If a modem plays music with 1000 tones per second, its symbol rate is 1000 symbols
 / Per second, or baud
 Since each tone in this example represents a message with two numeric bits, the bit rate is twice the symbol rate i
e
 2000 bits per second
 ankiy sanket kii ek paribhaasha ke anusaar, adhimishrit sanket ek ankiy sanket he, lekin ek anya paribhaasha main adhimishran ko ankiy se anuroop ke roopantaran bhi kaha gaya he
 In most textbooks, the digital modulation scheme is synonymous with data transmission as digital transmission, in very few textbooks it is called analog transmission
 atyaadhik moulik ankiy adhimishran takanic is prakaar hai: In QAM, an infinite signal and a quadrature phase amplitude are expressed in a finite number
 ise ek tu-channel pranali ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, harek channel ASK kaa upyog karata he
 The resulting signal is equivalent to a combination of both PSK and ASK
 uparokt sabhi paddati main harek charan, aavruti yaa aayam ek adbhut dohare beats ke pattern dwaara tay hote hai
 Typically, each phase encodes the same number of beats of frequency or amplitude
 is bits kii sankhya main shaamil pratik kaa pratinidhitiv vishesh charan dwaara hota he
 If the alphabet includes m = 2 n { \ displaystyle m = 2 ^ {N}} as an optional symbol, each symbol represents a message of n bits
 yadi pratik dar f s { \ displaystyle f_{s}} pratik prati second he, data dar n f s { \ displaystyle nf_{s}} beats prati second he
 For example, an alphabet that has 16 optional symbols, each symbol represents 4 bits
 isliye data dar bod dar se chaar guna hoga
 In PSK, ASK or QAM, where the carrier frequency of the modulated signal is constant, the modulation alphabet often simply represents the zodiac, the i signal of the amplitude for each signal representing the x-axis and the q signal by the y-axis
 QAM ke siddhant kaa upyog kar PSK or ASK, lekin kabhi-kabhi FSK bhi aksar paidaa kiya or pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 The i and q signal can be combined into the complex-value signal i + jq
 natijatan samatuly lo-paas sanket yaa samatuly besband sanket ke naam se janaa jane vaala vaastavik maan adhimishrit sanket physical sanket jatil maan kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The following are the common steps useful for transmitting data by a modulator: resiver kii ore se aamtaur par di-modulator nimna kaary karata he: It is common in all digital communication systems that both the modulator and the de-modulator must be designed simultaneously
 Numerical modulation schemes are possible because both the sender-recipient parties must know in advance how to encrypt the data and how to represent the communication system
 In all digital communication systems, both the modifier of the sender and the de-modulator of the receiver are designed in such a way that they can work with each other in addition to their work
 asangat adhimishran paddati main ek praapak ko sandarbh kaald sanket jo ki preshak vaahak wave ke saath ek hi charan main ghatit hota he, kii jarurat nahin hoti
 aise maamle main adhimishran sanket main atulykaalik rup se sthanantarit hota hai
 The opposite is favorable modulation
 sabase zyada aam ankiy adhimishran takanic is prakaar hai: MSK and GMSK are special cases of continuous phase modulation
 darasal, CPM ke upakutumb kaa MSK vishesh maamla he, jo ki continus phej frequency-shift keeing ek sankethik-samay kii avadhi ke taur par bhi janaa jaataa he, jo ki ek ytaakar aavruti pulse he
 OFDM is based on frequency division multiplexing, but is used as a numerical modulation scheme
 bit stream kai samanaantar data strimon main vibhajit ho jaataa he or harek stream paaramparik ankiy adhimishran yojana kaa upyog kar apane sab-carrier main sthanantarit ho jaataa he
 The OFDM signal is an abbreviated form of a modulated subcarrier
 OFDM ek bahuvidhi takanic ke bajaay ek adhimishran takanic ke rup main mana jaataa he, kyonki yah kisi bit stream ko tathakthith OFDM ke ek anukram kaa upyag karke sanchaar channel main hastantarit kar detaa he
 OFDM can be expanded from channel access method to orthogonal frequency division multiple access and MC-CDMA scheme to multi-user channel, so that multiple users can use the same medium by giving code to different subcarriers or multiple users
 Allow to do
 do prakaar ke RF power vistaarak, swichan vistaarak kam keemat vaala he or ek hi output pavaar vaale liner vistaarak kii tulana main kam bydaree pavaar kaa upyog karata he
 However, they only work with relatively stable amplitude modulation signals such as angular modulation and CDMA, but not with QAM and OFDM
 Although the switching amplifier is also completely unsuitable for a common QAM group, the QAM modulation principle is often used to allow switching amplifiers to run with these fms and other waveforms, and sometimes QAM de-modulation uses these switching
 This is done to get the signal by the expanders
 ankiy besaband adhimishran shabd pankti kuta yaa sanket kaa paryaay he
 It is a method of transferring a digital beat stream to the analog baseband, using a pulse train, which is a discrete numbered signal level, directly through modulating the voltage and current in the cable
 ekadhruviya, non-ritern-tu-jiro, manchester or alternet mark invarsan kutalekhan vagairah iske saamaanya udhaaharan hai
 The purpose of pulse modulation scheme is to transfer a narrowband analog signal to the pulse wave via modulation as a two-level signal in the analog baseband
 kuch pulse adhimishran yojana nairoband anuroop sanket ko ek ankiy sanket ek sthai bit rate; jo ki anternihit ankiy preshak paddati he, ke rup main sthanantarit ho saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye kuch pankti kuta, ko sthanantaran kii anumati pradaan karata he
 In the formal sense, they do not fall under the modulation scheme, as they are not channel coding schemes, but should be treated as source encoding schemes and in some cases as analog-to-digital conversion techniques
 analog-over-analog paddatiyaan : Analog-over-digital methods: vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga According to astrology and time reckoning, various yogas are described in Hinduism
 ye is prakaar hai:kaise nikaala jaye vivaah kaa muhoort Due to not matching the right marriage, the groom committed suicide
 Today is the age of computers, see who is sitting in his computer with some software astrology, as soon as any bride is married to the bride, the bride and the girl are spoken directly
 The birth dates of the horoscope are made with time etc
 and they are seen to match the marriage directly, Gun Chakra Nadi Dosh and Bhakut Dosh easily the software of the computer Man removes it, Mars, whether it is retrograde, is of lesser degree, it does not take time to accuse Mangali, the moon, whether it is old or old, it does not take long to match the zodiac, Virgo's master force
 Even if the Sun's force is not available at all, it is very weak, but according to the computer, it does not take long to tell the virtue cycle and the decision is made quickly, even if the lunar force of both is very Chchha be
 is prakaar se kitne arth ke anarth ho jate he jin logon ko vastav me katai jyotish kii jaankaree nahi he ve aasaani se var-kanya ke gun dosha bataane lagate he or jab unase koi baat poonchhi jaati he to ve apane gun ko sarvocch bataane kii aashaa me apane anaap sanaap vachaali niti ko apnaane lagate he
 It is auspicious to get married in the original Anuradha Mrigashira Revathi Hasta Uttaraphalguni Uttarashadha Uttarabhadrapat Swati Magha Rohini in Nakshatro and Jyeshtha Magha Falgun Baishakh Margashirsha Aashad in these months
 vivaah kaa saamaanya din panchang me likhaa rahata he at: paanchang ke liye din ko lekar us din var kanya ke liye yah vichaar karnaa kanya ke liye gurubal var ke liye surya bal dono ke liye chandrabal dekh lenaa chaiye
 Gurbal idea: -guru is auspicious in the ninth eleventh and second and seventh zodiac from the zodiac sign of Virgo, giving donations in the sixth and first zodiac is auspicious and inauspicious in the fourth and eighth in the twelfth
 surya bal vichaar:- surya var kii raashi se teesraa chatha dasva gyarahawa shubh hota he,doosraa paanchavaa saatva or navaan daan dene se shubh mana jaataa he,chauthaa aathvaan barahwaan surya ashubh hota he
 Chandrabal Idea: - Moon is auspicious by the sign of the bride and girl, third is sixth, seventh, tenth, eleventh, auspicious, second fifth, ninth, auspicious from charity, and fourth eighth is twelfth inauspicious
 vivaah me tyaagane vaali lagane:- din me tula vrishchik or raatri main makar raashi badhir he,din me singh mesh vrish or raatri main kanya mithun kark andhi he,din me kumbh or raatri me min dono lagane pangu he,singh mesh vrish makar kumbh min ye lagan subah or shaam ke samay kubade hote he
 Failure of renunciation: - If the marriage is in a deaf heart, the bridegroom may be laden with the treasure of Kuber but will be impoverished, if the marriage is done in the dark of day, the girl has to get distance from the groom, night If there is a marriage in the dark, then there is no question of being a child, and even if it is not alive, if the love is paralyzed, then wealth is destroyed and the dignity of the family begins to be destroyed
 lagan shuddhi:- lagan se barahave shani dasave mangal tisare shukr lagn me chandramaa or krur grah achche nahi hote he laganesh or saumy grah aathven bhav me achche nahi hote he saatve bhav me koi bhi grah shubh nahi hota he
 Planetary force: - In the first, fourth and ninth and tenth position, the master is going to destroy all the defects, the Sun in the eleventh position and the moon in the square of the highest position destroys the Navamsa Dosh, Mercury is in the fourth, fifth, ninth and tenth position
 So often auspicious from bad to good

 Argala fixes the fruit of the bhava or planet, that is, it handles firmly
 atah bhav va grah ke fal ko vigalit hone, risne se bachaane vaali grah sthiti argala kehalaati he
 If there are planets in 2, 4, 11 bhava from the house or planet which has to be seen, then it is inauspicious
 in sthanon ke kramshah 12, 10, 3 argala baadhak sthaan hote hai
 If the obstructing planets are weaker than the non-ergonomic or are less in number then they are the obstructing space
 lekin tritiy main teen papgrah hon to yah kabhi bhi baadhit nahin hoti tathaa ise vipareet argala kehete hai
 The fruit is also confirmed by this third house Argala
 pancham sthaan bhi argala sthaan he tathaa navam sthaan iskaa baadha sthaan he
 For Rahu and Ketu, the barrier place should be considered as Argala place and Argala place as obstacle place

 All the planets regularly orbit the Sun in a certain clockwise direction, but their motion is not even
 surya se duuri kaa inaki gati par prabhaav padataa he, jisase kabhi inaki gati tej hoti he tathaa kabhi dhimi
 The second effect is of the earth
 ham prithvi ke saapeksh inaki gatiyon ko dekhte hai jo swayan surya kii parikrama kar rahaa he, is kaaran jab donon vipareet disha main hote hai to ye teevr gati se bhaagate dikhaai dete hai tathaa surya ke ek hi ore hone par prithvi aage nikal jaati he, jisase sitaron ke saapeksh main purv kii ore jate hue bhi pashchim main jate dikhaai dete hai
 Hence this speed is called 'curve speed'
 vastutah koi bhi grah ‘vakri’ nahin hota he, kintu prithvi kii gati ke kaaran ulta jaataa dikhaai detaa he
 This is called 'virtual motion'
 anya samay main jab ye grah sitaron ke madhya pashchim se purv kii ore jate dikhaai dete hai to inaki gati ‘margi gati’ kehalaati he
 For this reason, Indian astrologers have determined the eight types of movements of these planets according to this virtual motion - curve, trajectory, growth, quick, quick, mand, mandar and samasam

 'solar year' and 'lunar year' are prevalent in India since ancient times
 inamen ek kaa rugveda tathaa duusare kaa atharvaveda main bhi varnan aayaa he
 Ritu is learned from the solar year
 chandra tithiyon, maason se hamaare adhiktar parv va tyohaar manaaye jate hai
 For this reason, our ancestors coordinated these two and made a year which is called lunar-solar year
 magar har do yaa teen varshon main ek maas badha diya jaataa he, jise ‘malmaas’, ‘purushottammas’ yaa ‘adhikmas’ kehete hai, us chandra varsh main 13 chandramaada hote hai
 In order to coordinate the two years, a rule was made that when Amavasya ends twice in a solar month, then that month's name becomes two lunar months and that lunar-solar year becomes 13 lunar months

 If the Moon is in the center of the Sun, then the native's religious education, knowledge, intelligence and wealth are of inferior nature
 usee prakaar yadi surya se chandramaa panafar arthath 2, 5, 8 or 11 sthangat ho to upar likhe hue gunon main jataka saadhaaran prakaar kaa hota he
 Again, if the moon is in the apoclim ie 3, 6, 9 and 12 from the sun, then the native possesses the above qualities
 yadi chandramaa apane navansh main ho yaa mitra-gruhi ho athwa us par brihaspati yaa shukr kii drushti padati ho to jataka dhani or sukhi hota he
 It is rich in eyesight from Jupiter and then by sight from Venus
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki yadi chandramaa par kisi grah kii drushti nahin padati ho to jataka ekant-priy hota he
 There are difficulties in earning money for such a person and there are obstacles in all his works

 According to Varahamiheer, if Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury are in the seventh, seventh and eighth positions of the moon in the birth, that is, there is 'adhyoga' in that place
 parantu anyaanya rishiyon kaa yah bhi kathan he ki janm-lagn se yadi brihaspati, shukr evam budh shashth, saptam evam ashtum gat ho to bhi ‘adhiyog’ hota he
 Some sage has also called it 'speaker-yoga'
 ek vidvan ke anusaar ‘lagn-adhiyog’ use kehete hai, jab lagn se 6, 7, 8 sthaan main shubhagrah baithe hon, ve na to paap se yukt hon na drasht ho or chaturth sthaan main papgrah na ho
 It is also available from the opinion that if there is auspiciousness in 6, 7, 8 places from the Moon-lagna and birth-lagna, then there is Adhog
 yadi papgrah baithe ho to ‘paap-adhiyog’ or yadi upar likhe hue shubhagrahon ke saath papgrah bhi ho to ‘mishra-adhiyog’ hota he
 For this reason there will be six types of 'adhyayag'
 arthath lagn se teen prakaar ke or chandra lagn se teen prakaar ke
 It is important to note here that Jupiter, Venus and Mercury are one each in 6, 7, 8 places or two in any place or all three will be in one place
 is adhiyog kaa fal yah he ki aisa jataka ‘shubh-adhiyog’ ke hone se grahon ke balaabal ke taratamyanusaar kisi raaj-singhaasana kaa adhikari hota he
