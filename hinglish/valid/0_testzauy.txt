 The art of cutting and deleting substances to save the land on the ground floor is called dredging
 talkarshan kaa mahatv is baat se spasht ho jaataa he ki suez nahar kaa nirmaan talkarshan dwaara 30,000,000 ton ret hataane par hi sanmbhav ho sakaa
 The machines used for dredging are called dredgers or jharyantras
 in mashiinon se jal ke andar jame padaarth nikaale jate hai or unki vyavastha kii jaati he
 The basic idea of dredging is to hold the deposited material with some kind of silt, to lift it over the water using a lifting device
 kaary vividh tareekon se puraa kiya jaataa he
 Dredging machines are usually mounted on floating vessels
 yadhyapi taton par sthit mashine bhi kaam main aati hai, tathaapi inkaa chalan apekshaya kam he
 The dredging function can be in the form of a continuous unit of action, or three different intermittent actions — excavation, hoisting, and arrangement
 utkhanit padaarth ko phaltu mitti kehete hai
 Classification of jhayantras can be done as follows: yah jal kii vidyaman gaharaai kii vruddhi ke liye padaarthon ke hataane kaa upkaran he
 It is a tool for the achievement of valuable and material soil for mining and use

 They are also found in many types of mixtures
 unki dridhtaa mitti sadrush komal or chattan sadrush kathor bhi ho sakati he
 Give sand and mud aise pramukh padaarth hai jo nadiyon, naharon or bandargahon main nauchaalan main avrodh upasthit karte hai
 Dredging of other substances is more difficult
 chikani mitti sadrush deele padaartho ko is upkaran se hataanaa kuch kathin hota he
 Some other substances cause difficulty only by entering the jhama and in some, due to their expansion, difficulty is often experienced

 In order to overcome the difficulty of throwing out a lot of water coming out together, a long pipeline is often attached to the jam, through which the surplus soil is taken to a certain place on the coast and spread from there
 But this soil settles on the ground
 is prakaar daldali bhoomi ke bharne main is jhaam kaa upyog hota he
 In the second method of arrangement, the discharge is left to sit in the dole itself

 The operation of the bucket is controlled by a rope in the girth at the top of the bucket
 jalayaan langaron par majbootee se tikaa diya jaataa he
 Deep excavation reactions are countered by keeping the vessel's water independent of the alab
 kathor padaarthon ko hataane ke liye icchit aakaar ke daanton kii vyavastha rahati he, jinase padaarthon ko khodakar hataaya ja saktaa he
 Then, the surplus soil is stacked in the vessel or on the side barge
 yadi bhujaayen adhik lambii hon to phaltu mitti ke dher sidhe nadi ke tat par lagaae ja sakate hai
 These are of two types: seepi baaltee main do jhaam hote hai, jo tal main seepi ke balve ke samaan band ho jate hai
 The end of the jhama remains occupied
 khuli hui baaltee tal main giraayi jaati he or vah donon vaalvon par uttolkar kriya ke kaaran apane hi bhaar se padaarth ko khodati he
 When the crane starts lifting, the bucket closes itself

 The lack of evidence of lava flows with any volcanic pool visible on Venus remains a puzzle
 grah par kuch prahaar cretar he jo sataha ke apekshaakrit yuva hone kaa pradarshan karte he or lagbhag 30-60 karod saal puraane he
 In addition to the striking craters, mountains, and valleys commonly found on terrestrial planets, Venus has many unique geographical formations

 After the completion of the VENRA mission, the head meridian was redefined to pass through the Ariaden crater
 shukr kii adhiktar sataha jwalamukhi gatividhi dwaara nirmit najar aati he
 Venus has many volcanoes like the Earth and some 167 large volcanoes in every 100 km radius
 prithvi par is aakaar kii jwalamukhi jatilta keval hawaii ke bade dweep par he
 This is not because Venus is more active than Earth from a volcanic point of view, but rather its crust is older
 prithvi kii samudri parpati vivartanik platon kii simaaon par bhugarbhiy prakriya dwaara nirantar punarnvikrut kar di jaati he or kareeb 10 karod varsh ausat umr kii he, jabaki shukr kii sataha 30-60 karod varsh puraani hone kaa anumaan he
 Numerous evidence points to the ongoing volcanism on Venus
 soviet venera kaarykram ke dauraan, venera 11 or venera 12 prob ne bijli ke ek nirantar pravaah kaa pataa lagaaya or venera 12 ne apane avataran ke baad ek shaktishaalee garjan kii kartaal darj kii | europea antariksh agency ke venus express ne unche vayumandal main prachur maatra main bijli darj kii | jabaki prithvi par barish garaj-toofaan laati he, vahiin shukr kii sataha par koi varsha nahin hoti he 
 There is a possibility that ash from a volcanic eruption produced electricity
 Another evidence comes from measurements of existing sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which were found between 1978 and 1986 from bundles with a factor of 10
 iskaa matlab yah ho saktaa he ki pehle bade paimaane par jwalamukheey visphot se str badhaayaa gaya tha
 The entire thousand craters on Venus are evenly distributed across the surface
 prithvi or chandramaa jaise anya cretaryukt nikaayon par, cretar giravat kii avasthaaon kii ek range dikhaate he
 The reason for the fall on the moon is progressively tucker, while on the earth it is due to wind and rain erosion
 shukr par lagbhag 85% cretar pracheen haalat main hai
 The number of craters, together with their well-protected conditions, indicates the planet's passing under a global reestablishment event some 30–60 million years ago, followed by a collapse in volcanism
 jahaan ek ore prithvi kii parpati nirantar prakriyaarat he, vahiin shukr ko is tarah kii prakriya ke poshan ke liye asamarth samajha gaya he
 Without plate tectonics, Venus undergoes a cyclic process to disperse heat from its mantle in which the mantle temperature rise continues until it reaches the peak level necessary for the weakening of the layer
 Then, over a period of about 10 million years, pressure occurs on a large scale that completely recycles the crust
 shukr cretaron ke paraas vyas main 3 kimi se lekar 280 kimi tak he
 There is no crater less than 3 km due to the effect of dense atmosphere on visitor bodies
 ek nishchit gatij urja se kam ke saath aane vaali vastuon ko vayumandal ne itnaa dhimaa kiya hai ki wein ek prahaar cretar nahin bana pate he
 Projections less than 50 km in diameter will be fragmented and consumed in the atmosphere before they reach the surface
 bhukampi data yaa jadtwaghurna kii jaankaree ke bagaiyr shukr kii aantarik sanrachana or bhu-rasayan ke bare main thodi hi pratyaksh jaankaree uplabdh he
 The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests that they share the same internal structure: a core, a mantle, and a crust
 prithvi par kii hi tarah shukr kaa kor kam se kam aanshik rup se taral he kyonki in do grahon ke thande hone kii dar lagbhag ek samaan rahi he
 The slightly smaller size of Venus suggests that the pressure in its deep interior is much lower than the Earth

 This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a possible explanation for the lack of internally generated magnetic field

 " 1967 main venera 4 ne shukr ke chumbakeey kshetra ko prithvi kii tulana main bahut kamjor paaya
 This magnetic field is induced by an interplay between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than an internal dynamo, like the inner core of the Earth
 shukr kaa chota sa prerit chumbakeey kshetra vayumandal ko brahmadia vikiran ke khilaaf naganya suraksha pradaan karata he
 This radiation may be the result of lightning discharge from cloud to cloud

 One possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core, or that its core is not currently cold, so the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature
 ek or sambhaavna ki iskaa kor pehle se hi puri tarah jam gaya he
 The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is currently unknown

 In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini reported the Moon orbiting Venus, which was named from the Neith
 After the next 200 years, many sightings were reported
 But most were determined to be nearby stars

 When Venus lies between the Earth and the Sun, it is at its largest size and presents its "nav Kala"
 iske vayumandal ko grah ke chaaron ore ke apavartit prakaash ke prabhamandal dwaara ek doorabeen main dekha ja saktaa hai
 Venus's orbit is slightly tilted relative to the Earth's orbit; Therefore, when this planet passes between the Earth and the Sun, it usually does not cross the face of the Sun

 Transit could be viewed directly from multiple online outlets or locally with appropriate equipment and conditions
 pargaman kii purvavarti jodi disambar 1874 or disambar 1882 main hui; aagaamee jodi disambar 2117 or disambar 2125 main ghatit hogi
 Historically, the transit of Venus was important, as they have allowed astronomers to directly determine the size of the astronomical unit, as well as the size of the solar system, as seen by Horrocks in 1639 by Captain Cook's Eastern Australia
 The discovery of the coast was made possible when he traveled to Tahiti in 1768 after a voyage to observe Venus transit

 In the early 17th century, when the Italian physicist Galileo Galilei made his first observation of the planet, he found it showing the moon-like arts, from crescent to ornate to full moon and vice versa
 jab yah surya se sarvaadhik dur hota he apana ardhachandra rup dikhaata he or jab surya ke sabase najadik hota he yah arddh chandrakaar yaa poornachandra kii tarah dikhataa he
 This was possible only if Venus orbited the Sun and was one of the first observations to explicitly refute Ptolemy's geocentric model, in which the solar system was centered and the Earth was at the center
 shukr ke vayumandal kii khoj 1761 main roosi bahushrut mikhail lomonosov dwaara hui thi
 The atmosphere of Venus was observed in 1790 by the German astronomer Yohan Schroter
 shroter ne paaya ki grah jab ek patala ardhchandra tha, katori 180° se adhik tak vistaarit hui
 He correctly surmised that this was due to scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere

 The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schröter incorrectly estimated periods of about 24 hours from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface
 20 veen sadi tak shukr ke bare main thodi bahut or khoj hui thi
 Its nearly featureless DSK gave no clue as to what its surface might be

 The first ultraviolet observations were made in the 1920s when Frank E
 Ross found that ultraviolet photographs showed much more detailed detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation
 unhone suzav diya aisa nichle pile vaataavaran ke saath uske upar ke pakshabh megh ke atyadhik ghaneypan kii vajah se tha
 Spectroscopy observations in the 1900s gave the first clue about the rotation of Venus
 vesto slifer ne shukr se nikle prakaash ke dopler shift ko maapne kii koshish kii, lekin paaya ki vah kisi bhi ghurnan kaa pataa nahin laga sake
 He speculated that the planet must have a very long rotation period
 1950 ke dashak main baad ke kaary ne dikhaaya ki ghurnan pratigaami tha
 The Venus's radar observations were first made in the 1960s, providing the first measurements of the rotation period, close to modern values
 1970 ke dashak main radar prekshanon ne pehali baar shukr kii sataha ko vistrut rup se ujagar kiya
 Pulsions of radio waves were transmitted to the planet using a 300-meter radio telescope at the Eresibo Observatory, and the echoes detected two highly reflective regions designated from the alpha and beta regions

 In fact, Mariner 5 was originally created as a backup to Mariner 4, which is related to Mars
 But when the mission was successful, the vehicle was converted for the Venus mission
 Its equipment pairs were more sensitive than those on the Mariner 2
 vishesh rup main iske radio prachhaadan prayog ne shukr ke vayumandal kii sanrachana, dabaav or ghanatv ke data preshit kiye
 The combined data of the Venera 4-mariner 5 were analyzed over the next year in a series of formal conversations by a joint soviet-american science team
 yah antariksh sahyog kaa ek praarambhik udhaaharan he
 Following the lessons learned from Venera 4, the Soviet Union launched the twin vehicles Venera 5 and Venera 6 in a five-day interval in January 1969
 shukr se inkaa saamana usee saal ek din ke aad main 16 va 17 may ko hua
 The crushing pressure limit of the vehicle was increased to 25 bars and equipped with small parachutes to achieve a faster descent
 baad ke, shukr ke haal ke vayumandaleey modelon ne sataha ke dabaav ko 75 or 100 baar ke bich hone kaa suzav diya tha
 Therefore, there was no hope for these vehicles to survive on the surface
 After transmitting atmospheric data for a short interval of 50 minutes, both the ships were destroyed at an altitude of about 20 km before hitting the surface of the night side of Venus
 venera 7 ko grah ke sataha se nikle data ko waapas laane ke prayaas ke liye pesh kiya gaya
 It was manufactured with a strong descent module capable of withstanding 180 bar pressure
 modul ko pravesh se pehle thanda kiya gaya, saath hi 35 minute ke tej avataran ke liye ise ek vishesh rup se sametane vaale parachute ke saath las kiya gaya tha
 It continued to enter the atmosphere on 15 December 1970, while the parachute is believed to have partially exploded and the probe hit the surface with a loud, but not fatal

 The Venera program continued with Venera 8
 After entering the atmosphere on 22 July 1972, it sent data from the surface for 50 minutes
 Venera 9 entered the atmosphere on 22 October 1975
 Whereas Venera 10 entered the atmosphere exactly three days after that on 25 October and sent the first pictures of Venus landscape
 Both vehicles presented very different scenarios in their immediate vicinity

 The time to close the Venera program came in October 1983, when Venera 15 and Venera 16 were placed in orbit for mapping the terrain of Venus with synthetic aperture radar
 1985 main soviet sangh ne, shukr or usee varsh andruni soramandal se hokar guzar rahe heley dhoomaketu, se mili avasar kaa sanyukt abhiyaanon se bharpoor phayda uthaaya
 On 11 and 15 June 1985, two spacecraft of the Vega program on the road to Haley dropped one Venera-style entry and a balloon-supported aerobot was released within the upper atmosphere
 gubbaaron ne 53 kimi ke kareeb ek santulit oonchai hasil kii, jahaan dabaav or taapmaana tulanaatmak rup se prithvi kii sataha par jitna hota hai
 Both remained operational for about 46 hours and found Venus's atmosphere more turbulent than previously believed
 The turbulent atmosphere here refers to high winds and powerful convection chambers

 It is also called 'guru Granth Sahib'
 iskaa sampadan sikh dharm ke paanchaven guru shri guru arjuna dev ji ne kiya
 The first light of Guru Granth Sahib was on 16 August 1604 at Harimandir Sahib in Amritsar
 1705 main damdama sahib main dashamesh pita guru govind singh ji ne guru tegbahadur ji ke 116 shabd jodakar isko purna kiya, isame kul 1430 prishth he
 Gurugranth Sahib contains not only the teachings of Sikh Gurus, but also the speech of 30 other Hindu saints and Muslim devotees of the Alang religion

 The verses of Sheikh Farid, who believed in offering Namaz at all five times, are also recorded in the Guru Granth Sahib

 The simplicity, comprehensibility, accuracy of its language attracts the masses
 vahiin sangeet ke suron va 31 raagon ke prayog ne aatmavishyak gudh aadhyatmik upadeshon ko bhi madhur va sargrahi bana diya he

 Gurugranth Sahib gives lessons to the seekers who are looking for the means of attaining God in sannyas, cut off from the mainstream of society

 Template: Ark Sikh Sect sikhon kaa pavitra dharmagranth jise unke paanchaven guru arjunadev ne san 1604 i
 main sangruhit karaayaa tha or jise sikh matanuai 'gurugranth sahib ji' bhi kehete evam guruvat maanakar sammanit kiya karte hai
 Under 'adigranth', apart from the first five gurus of Sikhs, there are the statements of their ninth Guru and 14 'bhagats'
 aisa koi sangrah sambhavat: guru nanakdev ke samay se hi taiyaar kiya jane laga tha or guru amardaas ke putr mohan ke yahan pratham chaar guruon ke patradi surakshit bhi rahe, jinhen paanchaven guru ne unase lekar pun: krambaddh kiya tathaa unamem apni ore kuch 'bhagaton' kii bhi baniyaan sammilit karke sabko bhai gurudas dwaara gurumukhi main lipibaddh kara diya
 Brother Bannon then copied the same and mixed the compositions of some other people which were not approved, but also the works of some others, Govind Singh prepared a third 'beed' in which, along with the works of the ninth Guru, himself
 One of his 'saloks' was also ranked
 uskaa yahi rup aaj bhi vartmaan samajha jaataa he
 It is difficult to say only about a few final compositions when and how they were added
 'granth' kii pratham paanch rachanaayen kramash: 'japunisanu', 'sodaru' mahala1, 'sunibada' mahala1, 'so purakhu', mahala 4 tathaa sohila mahala ke naamon se prasiddh hai or inke ananthar 'sirirag' aadi 31 raagon main vibhakt pad aate hai jinamein pehle sikhaguruon kii rachanaayen unke anusaar sangruhit hai
 The positions of the Bhagats have been kept in their interiors, but somewhere in between, 'barhamasa', 'thinti', 'dinraini', 'ghodiyaan', 'siddha Gosthi', 'karhale', 'birhade', 'sukhmani' etc
 Certain small and big specific compositions have also been added, which illustrate the poetic nature of ordinary folk songs
 un raganusaar krambaddh padon ke ananthar salok sahas kriti, 'gaatha' mahala 5, 'phunhe' mahala 5, chaubolen mahala 5, savaie simukh vaak mahala 5 or mudaavni mahala 5 ko sthaan mila he or sabhi ke ant main ek ragamala bhi de di gai he
 Even in the midst of these works, if 'salok' of Kabir and Sheikh Farid is stored, then elsewhere there are those eulogies created by 11 posts which are said to be in praise of Sikh Gurus and whose number is not even less
 'granth' main sangruhit rachanaayen bhashavavidhya ke kaaran kuch vibhinn lagati hui bhi, adhiktar saamanjasy evam ekarupata ke hi udhaaharan prastut karti hai
 Sometimes Adibranth is also called 'gurubani', but in the eyes of its devotees, it is always a physical guru
 at: guru ke samaan use svachh reshmi vastron main veshtit karke chandani ke neeche kisi unchi gaddi par 'padhraya' jaataa he, usapar chanwar dhalate hai, pushpadi chadhaate hai, uski aarti utaarte hai tathaa uske saamne naha dhokar jate or shraddhapurvak pranaam karte hai
 Sometimes his procession is also taken out and always try to walk accordingly
 granth kaa kabhi saptahik tathaa kabhi akhand paath karte hai or uski panktiyon kaa kuch uccharan us samay bhi kiya karte hai jab kabhi baalkon kaa namakaran kiya jaataa he, use diksha di jaati he tathaa vivahadi ke mangalotsav aate hai athwa shavsanskaar kiye jate hai
 Suitable times for specific small major compositions such as morning, evening, bedtime are certain and although the subjects of major collected works seem to be mainly related to philosophical principles, spiritual practice and praise, there is no doubt that 'etc
 The entire religious life of the Sikhs is influenced by the book
 guru govindsingh kaa ek sangrahagranth 'dasam granth' naam se prasiddh he jo 'aadigranth' se pruthak evam sarvatha bhinn he
 Guru Granth Sahib is written in Gurmukhi script
 guru granth sahib kii guuruvaniyan adhikansh punjab pradesh main avatarit hai or is kaaran jan-saadhaaran unki bhashaa ko punjabi ke sadrush anumaan karata he; jabaki aisi baat nahin he
 The language of Sri Gurugranth Sahib is closer to the Hindi language than the modern Punjabi language and the meaning of guru-vyans is more perceptible to the Hindi-speaking than the Punjabi-speaking one
 duusari ore yadhyapi shri dasam granth kii bhi lipi gurmukhi he, parantu isaki bhashaa praayah apbhransh hindi main kavitaabaaddh he
 Its language is more difficult for Punjabi-speakers but well-known for Hindi-speakers
 guru granth sahib kii bhashaa ko 'sant bhashaa' bhi kehete hai jisamen bahut si bhashaaon, baliyon or upboliyon kaa mishran he jisamen lahindi punjabi, brajabhasha, khadi boli, sanskrit or farsi aadi pramukh hai

 Those who believed in the tradition of democracy believed that the scope and power of the government should be limited, ie the center should be less powerful than the states because if the center was too powerful then the freedom of citizens would be disrupted and the identity of the states would be lost

 inamen 24 pratinidhi sahuukaar varg ke, 15 pratinidhi uttari kshetra ke or daason ke maalik the, 14 pratinidhi bhoomi kaa sauda va sattebaaji ke vyavsaay se sambandhit, 11 pratinidhi vyavsaayee va jahaaj nirmaataa the
 There was no representative of artisans, small farmers and poor people in the conference

 This powerful central government will be able to levy various taxes from time to time
 charles beard kii is sthapana ko kai itihasvidon ne chunauti di
 Forrest Macdonald, in his book "we the People: The Eco- nomic Origins of Constitutions", stated that this recognition would not prove in any way that the protection of the interests of personal property was the key element that changed the direction of constitution making
 jin logon ne samvidhan kaa praaroop taiyaar kiya use angeekrut karne main pratyaksh sahaayta di un pratinidhiyon kii prishthbhumi kisi bhi rahi ho ek baar jab unhone sammelan main bhagidaari nibhaana shuru kiya to ve vyaktigat varg na rahakar ek ekikrut aarthik samooh ban gaye
 As far as saying that the farmers opposed the constitution, it does not seem right that the constitution was easily accepted even in the predominantly agrarian states like New Jersey, Maryland, Georgia
 is drushti se charles beard ke dwaara pratipaadit samvidhan ke swaroop kii aarthik dastavej ke rup main vyakhya ko purnatah sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Yet the specific contribution of his vote lies in the fact that he paid attention to the form of the Constitution of America and inspired other historians to think about it
 usne jo buniyaad mudde uthaae ve samay kii kasuti par is rup main khare utre ki logon kaa dhyaan samvidhan ke swaroop or usamen kis baat par bal diya jaataa he yaa diya janaa chahie, is ore unka dhyaan aakrisht kar saken
 In order to bring the nation building to perfection after independence, a constitution was needed to unite the society with various customs and pluralistic customs
 itnaa hi nahin jin muddon ko lekar upniveshon ne kranti kii thi unhen bhi samvidhan ke madhyam se dur kiya janaa tha
