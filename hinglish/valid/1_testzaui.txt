 ucch or nimna darja tiimon ke bich ek match taiyaar kii ucch darja team kii keemat par kam rated team ko phayda hoga
 An 'average' is that the team should have a rating of 100 as often as it loses while playing a mixture of strong and weak teams

 Every May, matches and points are removed between 3 and 4 years ago, and match and points earned between 1 and 2 years are switched weightings from the first 50% to 100% weighting
 udhaaharan ke liye, may 2014 main, maichon may 2010 or may 2011 ke bich khelaa hataa diya gaya he, or maichon may 2012 or may 2013 ke bich khele 50% veitings ke liye band
 This happens overnight, so any team can result in changing positions in the ranking table, regardless of play
 har baar jab donon tiimon ke ek or shrunkhlaa ko puraa, ranking teble ke neeche ke rup main varnit he, tiimon kii reating thik pehle ve khele aadhaar par adhyatan kiya jaataa he
 Rating points for each team draw: ke rup main prayek match jeeta ek team 1 siries bindu kamata he or unke pratidwandvi 0, haari hui unamem 0 shrunkhlaa ank or unke pratidwandvi 1 kamata he, or drawing donon tiimon aadha shrunkhlaa bindu kamata he, prayek match khelaa prakaar ke rup main isliye tiimon reating ank kamata he: This formula only applies when the difference between the ratings of the two teams at the start of the series was at least 40 points, winning a match will always earn a team more rating points than the rating they already had, and a match Losers will always earn lower rating points in a team than the rating they already had
 ek match aakarshith kamjor team reating ve pehle se hi tha, or majboot team kam se adhik reating ank arjeet karenge
 The difference between winning and losing a single match is therefore 100 points
 iske alaava, ek match ke nattejey main ek jeet or haar yaa dra ho jaati he, chaahe kul darza he ki match se donon tiimon ke dwaara arjeet ank se pehle shrunkhlaa shuru hui do tiimon 'retings kaa yoga hoga
 The total rating points earned from a series will therefore be multiplied by the first series equal to the sum of both teams' ratings
 reating ank ke liye majboot team ke baraabar he: And the rating for the weaker team equals points: is prakaar ke rup ke rup main upar, prayek match khelaa isliye tiimon reating ank kamata he: Therefore, again, winning a match will always earn a team more rating points than the rating they already had, and losing a match will always earn less rating points in a team than the rating they already had
 ek match aakarshith kamjor team reating ve pehle se hi tha, or majboot team kam se adhik ank arjeet karenge
 For both teams, the difference between winning and losing a single match is still 100 points
 iske alaava, inamen se jo bhi teen parinaamon main se hota he, kul darza he ki match se donon tiimon ke dwaara arjeet ank do tiimon 'reating ke yoga se pehle shrunkhlaa shuru hogi
 For each team: do tiimon, shuru main 120 or 90 kii reating ke saath, ek 3 maichon kii shrunkhlaa he, or ucch praarambhik reating ke saath team khilne maan lijie jeetta 2-1: Atikay is a character of Ramayana

 Although Guru Granth Sahib recognizes the importance of introspection, meditation, Guruvani opposes abandonment, inaction, inertia in the name of Sadhana

 Such a collection probably began to be prepared from the time of Guru Nanakdev and Moradhan, son of Guru Amardas, also preserved the letters of the first four gurus, which the fifth guru rearranged from him and some of the 'bhagats' Including the statements of 'bhai Gurudas', everyone got it written in Gurmukhi

 yuddh ne jansadharan ke mastishk ko thakaane ke atirikt usapar sanyam ke sthaan par sainya anushaasan aropit kar sabhi saamaajik kshetron main ajnapaalan kii pravriti utpann kii
 The centralization of power required for military purposes made the people habitual to accept decisions of autocratic power to solve social problems that would not be answerable to anyone
 aisi paristhiti main janatantric paddati vighatit hoti jaan padi
 As a result, in the countries most affected by the war, people were generally ready to welcome such an 'iron man' who would solve problems by his will and order in the name of the nation without taking his opinion on the strength of his valor, confidence and determination
 at: janata ke liye saamanyat: ekadhinaayak vah karmath vyakti hua jo swayan rashtriya pratik ban kisi rahasyatmak aakarshan dwaara apane prati aadar kaa bhav jagaa sake tathaa is aadhaar par logon ko mahaan hone kaa anubhav kara sake ki ve usase sambandhit hai
 The first characteristic of monotheism is in its origin
 kisi desh tathaa yug main isaki sthapana kabhi un sadhano se nahin hoti jo us desh or yug main vaid maane jate hai
 For that it is necessary that its foundation be on the violation of the law, although its existence is not dependent on the non-acceptance of any legislation
 prayek ekadhinaayakatv kaa prarambh viplav se hota he or phir sambhavat: kinhin kaarnon se vah apana krantikari swaroop banaae rakh saktaa he
 But its aim may be to replace the old one with a new one because the monopoly rule presupposes the failure of the old, old system and its destruction for the new system
 uski duusari pramukh visheshta yah he ki janatantr ke vipareet iskaa sanchaalan ek vyakti yaa varg ke haath main dusron par shashan karne ke liye hota he
 Thirdly, the ruling openly declares that it has a special place in the nation
 atev vyapak arth main ekadhinayakeey sarkaar vah vyavastha he jisamen rajya ke ek yaa kai sadsy khule tathaa vyavasthit dhang se puure raashtra par shakti kaa -jise unhone purv ke sabhi vaid aadhikaron or sthapanaaon ke ulanghan ke falswaroop honevaali hinsa se arjeet kiya he-prayog sarkaar main bhaag na lenevaali janata kii sammati se swatantra rahakar karte hai
 Depending on the nature of the government, monopolies can be divided into two categories: vaiyaktik ekadhinaayakatv main ekadhinaayak apane nijee karmchaariyon kii sahaayta se 'fayurar' ke siddhant ke aadhaar par swatantra dhang se shashan karata he
 The specialty of the furor is that he is not responsible to his assistants, but declares his obligation to the nation — history, or God — above himself
 fayurar apane sahaayakon ko niyukt karata he jo apane adheen karmchaariyon ko or ye karmchaaree phir apane adheenon ko niyukt karte hai
 Thus the electoral system has no place in the entire system and the entire structure is observed at the highest peak point
 samuhik ekadhinaayakatv main fayurar ke sthaan par uttaradaayi netaa hote hai; netaaon kii ek shrenee ucchtar shrenee ke netaaon ko chunati he, prayek netaa apane nirvaachakon ke prati uttaradaayi hota he
 Thus, the entire structure is based on the lowest base
 saamaajik shaktiyon ke aadhaar par bhi ekadhinaayakatv ke do varg ho sakate hai
 Therefore, this division takes place on the basis of ruling and auxiliary class
 varg ekadhinaayakatv ke aadhunik teen pramukh prakaar hai : sainya, dal or prashaskeey
 The third classification can be on the basis of quantitative format; As such, adhinayakawad ke teenon vargeekaran ek duusare se sambhddha bhi ho sakate hai
 Military monopolies, as such, can be both private and collective
 sabhi mahatvapurn ekadhinaayakataaon main dharmik sampradayikta kii visheshta hoti he, yatha utsaah ke saath pravartak kii puja tathaa ek vishisht vidhi ke prati shraddha
 Driven by great individuals, always inspired by a lucrative ideology, demanding sacrifices as a duty to its followers, monolithicism is a form of government established by an active individual
 vah un parakramee or gatisheel virgo ko lekar chalata he jo swabhaavat: viplav ke liye pravrutt hote hai : yatha, sena, shur varg yaa sarvhaara varg
 Ekadhinayak continues to impose his will and thoughts on the governed
 is aropan ke do saadhan hai: nakaaratmak, sakaaratmak
 Negative means are to stop criticism, destroy anti-majority or minority, keep essential and important facts related to the state a secret
 in sadhano ke sahaayak saadhan hai: sansad kii samaapti, sanghon tathaa dalon kaa vighatan, press par pratibandh, shiksha par niyantran, pramukh virodhiyon kaa nishkasana aadi
 Violence and terror are also discussed in this regard, but in reality these are only the signs of the initial state of monopolies, which are generally revolutionary and therefore illegal
 yadi ekadhinaayakatv is avasthaa se guzarane main safal hua to vah saadhaarant : hinsa or aatank ke sthaan par prashaskeey vidhaan sthapit karata he
 Military monopolies are generally satisfied by these negative means; But class monopolism also uses positive means in addition to these; As such, the imposition of public opinion, views and opinions of public by publicity, creation of favorable opinion etc
 in sadhano ke sahaayak saadhan hai : rashtriya yaa vargpratikon kii puja, uttejk sangeet kaa prasar, dambh yaa ghrinaa kii bhavanaayen ubhaaranevaale bhaashan, ajnapaalan kii aadat daalane ke liye samast raashtra ko sainya shiksha dena, vidyalayon ke liye pustaken taiyaar karnaa, abuddhik vichaardhaara kaa prachaar, raajnneetigyon, patrakaron tathaa vidwaanon ko ghoose dekar unka munh band karnaa
 But in any civilized country, which has had a past or idealist or democratic, these means are not sufficient to establish monotheism as long as it has attractive ideals, such as obedience, discipline, authority, unity, power, patriotism etc
 There should not be a continuous appeal to the person and the person should not be enthusiastic about giving up his personal rights in the hands of the monarch
 iske liye dharm se sambandhit bhaavon ko vikrut kar apane rajya, raashtra, jati yaa varg kii stuti yaa puja ke bhaavon main parinat kiya jaataa he
 Apart from the manner in which monopolistic establishment is established illegally, its elimination is often impossible
 ekadhinayakawad raashtra ko swytt shashan kii vidhiyaan seekhney se roktaa he or isliye ek ekadhinaayak ke dehanth ke baad vyaktiyon or virgo main satta ke liye pratidwandvita raashtra ke liye vipatti kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 There are so many benefits in the practice of the dictatorship system that in many democratic states, the public starts to wish for a dictatorial system, bored with the freedom to arbitrate some people in democracy
 agar adhinayakatantr ke utkarsh ke kaarnon kii khoj kii jaae to vidit hoga ki jis-jis desh main niraashaa, avyavashtha, asantosh tathaa abhaav tha vahiin adhinayakatantr kaa udai hua he
 In countries where the system of democracy became frustrating and lacking in people, this system was established
 aaj bhi anek rajyon main janata adhinayakatantr ko acha maanakar nirankush shaskaon kaa purna samarthan karti hui dikhaai detii he
 From this it is clear that the Adhinayaktantra has some qualities which are responsible for the motivation to adopt this system despite the theoretical superiority of other systems
 sankshep main aise shashan ke nimnlikhit laabh hai- Governance is efficient in the dictatorship
 sari shashan shakti ek vyakti main nihit hone ke kaaran, na keval nirnay shighrata se liye ja sakate he, varan nirnyon ke kriyanvayan kii bhi suvyavastha ho jaati he
 In the dictatorial system, everyone is afraid of the ruler, therefore, he cannot delay or relax the work
 nirankush shaasha ke prati sampoorn prashasan na keval uttaradaayi rahata he apitu har samay satark, sachet va sakriy bhi rahata he
 This leads to efficiency in governance
 is vyavastha kaa doosraa gun desh kaa teji se vikaas he
 Having only one leader, one plan and one development goal in the country, the entire power of the country is used to pave the way to this goal
 aarthik sadhano kaa samuchit vikaas va upyog sambhav hota he
 The development of the country requires unity, peace and order
 adhinayakatantr main inaki thos vyavastha rahane ke kaaran desh ke saare saadhan vikaas main lagaae ja sakate hai
 The dictatorship is very helpful in establishing unity in the country
 vibhinn dalon tathaa virodhiyon kaa daman karke desh main ek dal va ek netaa kaa shashan sthapit hone ke kaaran sari janata iske prati vafaadaar ho jaati he
 All the arrangements around the leader are intertwined and the country is tied into a single thread of solid unity
 dal yaa netaa ekta main baandhne kaa saadhan ho jaataa he or usee main sabko apnatv kaa abhas hone lagata he
 Hitler and Mussolini were similarly successful in uniting Germany and Italy
 rashtinyata kii bhaavana jaagrath karne main sahaayak he
 Having an ideology, a party and a leader is sufficient to bind the citizens of the country in reciprocity
 sabhi naagarik bandhutv kii bhaavana se anupranit rahete hai
 The slogan of a nation makes everyone stand under the same flag
 desh bhakthi kaa itnaa prabalya hota he ki naagarik apane desh tathaa netaa ke liye balidaan tak karne ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 The dictatorial system is the best in times of crisis
 isamen sankat kaa saamana karne ke liye sabhi nirnay va adarsh ek vyakti dwaara diye jane ke kaaran, adeshon kii ekta rahati he
 This makes it easy to take appropriate action on time
 yudhkalin sankat main to yahi vyavastha vijay dilaati he
 Multifaceted development of the country takes place in a dictatorial system
 aarthik kshetra main bhi teji se vikaas kii vyavastha hoti he
 Due to unity, discipline and duty-devotion, the best system of development is achieved
 rus, germany, china, italy, turki or spain kaa abhi tak itihaas is baat kaa sakshi he
 In his book Europe Sins the War, Jackson rightly writes - "this is the first time in the history of the Spaniards that the trains have run on time
" adhinaayak ke adheen vyapaar or udyog samrudh hue hai
 Agriculture is fruitful
 shram sankat dur ho gaye hai
 " kuch vidwaan adhinayakatantr ko maanav-swabhaav ke anukool bhi maanate hai
 In its favor, he says that human beings naturally have a desire to protect their interests
 vah apni raksha chahta he chaahe yah kisi ke dwaara kii jaay
 Wants to solve his problems
 aam janata ko isse koi matlab nahin hota he ki uski raksha vyavastha cor karata he? vah to suraksha chaahati he, apane hiton kii purti chaahati he
 Due to such a possibility in Adhinayakatantra, it is also considered a system suited to human nature
 vikasshil rajyon ke liye raajnneetik or aarthik vikaas kii sankramanakalin paristhitiyon main bhi adhinayakatantr upyogi mana gaya he
 In developing states, the problem of disciplined expression of public will has been very strong
 vikaas ke vibhinn charnon ko paar karne ke prayaas main navdith raashtra jan aakankshaon ko jaagrit to kar dete hai, parantu jan aakankshaayen jitani teji se jaagrit hoti hai, utani teji se ve unki purti nahin kar pate hai
 Due to this, the tension on the state system increases and there is a fear of its breakdown
 aisi sthiti main raajnneetik anushaasan banaae rakhane ke liye adhinayakatantr adhik upyogi ho saktaa he
 Huntington has rightly said that 'the first task in the newly born nations should be to build a basic, institutional structure in place of increase of political participation, education etc
 and for this one-party rule or military dictatorship may also be appropriate
 ’ Despite the merits of the Adhinayaktantra, this system is not practiced in any country for a long period
 itihaas aise pramaanon se bharaa padaa hai jahaan kahin bhi adhinayakatantr sthapit hota he vahiin par ek sthiti aisi aati he jab janata satta sampann sarvocch shaasha ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye hinsaatmak kranti tak kaa sahaara lene main nahin hichkichaati he
 It is clear from this that some shortcomings are definitely found in this system
 sankshep main is pranali ke dosha is prakaar hai- Due to the lack of respect for the personality of the person in this system, despite all the facilities, the person does not get the environment to develop his personality according to his will and he is forced to keep his life incomplete
 vyakti ko kisi bhi prakaar swatantraaa nahin rahati he
 This keeps his personality suppressed
 taanaashaahee vyavastha main moulik adhikaron evam vyaktigat swatantraaa ko koi mahatv nahin diya jaataa he
 Therefore, the biggest drawback of the dictatorial system is to create an atmosphere of repression of the personality of the person
 adhinayakatantr shashan vyavastha main atyaachaar or anachar kaa bolbalaa rahata he
 The dictator continues to spread terror to maintain his power
 virodhiyon kaa barbar tareekon se safaya kar diya jaataa he
 Due to this, humans get frightened and get locked up in jail
 desh hit main kahi gai baat bhi agar taanashaah kii ichha ke pratikul he to usko thukraa diya jaataa he tathaa uske viruddh baat kehane vaale ko deshvidrohi kahkar maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 The dictatorial system is detrimental to the country
 is vyavastha main nirnay ek vyakti letaa he jo kisi bhi prakaar kaa virodh yaa suzav sweekaar nahin karata he
 Due to this, the whole people have to suffer the harmful effects of wrong decisions taken by the dictator
 adhinaayak kaa har nirdesh logon ko maananaa padataa he, chaahe vah nirdesh rashtiy hit main ho athwa nahin ho
 Thus, there is no proper protection of national interests in dictatorial system
 adhinayakatantr main saadhaaran vyaktiyon main aatm-nirbharta, kriyasheeltaa tathaa swatantraaa kii bhaavana kaa purnatah lop ho jaataa he, kyonki unhen bolne athwa vichaarne aadi kii kisi prakaar kii swatantraaa nahin rahati he
 In this system, a person's body, wealth and even his mind becomes for the Adhinayak and he is forced to walk wherever the Adhinayak is
 adhinayakatantr ke gun or dosha ke vivechan se spasht he ki yah vyavastha manushya ko manushya nahin banaati tathaa use manushya ke rup main rahane bhi nahin detii he
 In this, the personality of the human remains suppressed
 uski sari bhautik aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke uparant bhi usko kuch kami si mahasoos hoti he
 His life becomes like a prisoner
 isliye hi adhinayakatantr ke anek laabhon ke hote hue bhi koi vyakti is vyavastha ke antargat rahanaa pasand nahin karata he
 Everything remains for the person in this regime, but still he suffocates in such a system, because the person does not live only for bread
 vah iske alaava bhi bahut kuch paanaa va karnaa chahta he jo keval sochane-vichaarne tathaa abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke vaataavaran main hi sambhav hota he
 Therefore, in spite of all the attractions of the Adhinayaktantra, stress remains invalid by the common people due to it being a deterrent to the means of satisfying the hunger of the brain
 is shashan ke gun-dosha ke vivechan ke baad iske bhavishya ke bare main sanket dena saral ho jaataa he
 According to the census of India, this village is located in Tehsil Moradabad, District Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh

 The 747 first started commercial flight in 1970 and retained the record of passenger carrying capacity for 37 consecutive years

 Boeing did this because the company expected that the supersonic aircraft 747 and other aerial aircraft would be out of circulation; While he was confident that the demand for submarine freight aircraft would be strong in future
 The 747 was expected to become obsolete, particularly after selling 400, but it surpassed the 1000 production mark in 1993, surpassing the expectations of its critics
 june 2010 tak 1,418 vimaan nirmit kiye ja chuke hai tathaa vibhinn sanrachanaon ke aadesh par 109 or vimaanon kaa nirmaan shesh he

 In 1963, the US Air Force began a series of study projects on a very large tactical transport aircraft

 These studies resulted in the initial need for a cx-heavy military machinery system in March 1964 with a carrying capacity of 180,000 lb, speed 0
75 Mc 500 mi / h or 805 km / h * and 115,000 lb

 The design of only four engines also required a design with greatly increased power and better fuel efficiency

 After an initial selection process, Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed were awarded the engine contract to General Electric and Pratt and Whitney with an additional study contract for the airframe
 airfrem ke sabhi teenon prastaavon main anek suvidhaon ko saajha kiya gaya he
 a door had to be included where the cockpit used to be, to be capable of loading from the front side as required by the CX-HLS
 All companies resolved this problem by moving the cockpit over the cargo area; Douglas made a small "pod" just ahead of the wing, Lockheed used a long spine over the entire length of the plane through which the base structures of the wings passed, just below the nose of the aircraft
 With a long pod going backwards, Boeing blends the two
 1965 main lochid ke aircraft dizin or general electric ke ingine dizin ko, us samay vishwa ke sabase bade sainik vimaan, nae si-5 gallexi ke liye chunaa gaya
 The concept of front door nose and elevated cockpit was used in the 747's design

 During this time, the congestion at the airports was made worse by the increase in the number of passengers carried by relatively small aircraft, considering the problem that Tripé thought was a big new aircraft

 In the role of the freighter, there was a clear need to support containerized transportation methods, which were being widely introduced around the same time
 maanak container saamne kii ore 8 feet varg hote hai tathaa 20 or 40 feet lambaaiyon main uplabdh hai
 This meant that similar to the earlier CX-HLS project, two or three rows of 2-wide 2-high container racks as deep as the aircraft's fuselage were possible
 1966 april main, pan em ne 52

 On the 50th anniversary, during the formal banquet of the signing of the 747 contract in Seattle, according to Malcolm T
 Stamper, one of the senior managers of the 747 campaign at the time, Juan Tripp predicted that the 747 was "for the fate of mankind, Competing with intercontinental missiles, would be a great weapon of peace

 However, this idea was abandoned in 1966 in favor of a comprehensive one-storey design, due to the problem of evacuation routes and limited freight carrying capacity
 isliye cockpit ko sankshipt duusare tal par rakhaa gaya, taaki saamne vali naak yaa shanku main maal ke ladaan ke liye darwaja shaamil kiya ja sake; dizin kii is visheshta ne hi 747 ke vishisht "ubhaar" ko janm diya
 In early models it was unclear what to do with the small contiguous space behind the cockpit, so it was initially "marked" as a restroom without a permanent seating arrangement

 General Electric pioneered the concept, but remained committed to developing engines for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later
 Pratt and Whitney were also working on the same principle; in late 1966, Boeing, pan-am and Pratt and Whitney agreed to develop a new engine named JT9D for the 747
 pariyojna ko dosha-vriksh vishleshan naamak ek nai kaary paddati ke saath dizin kiya gaya tha jisamen ek akele bhaag ke dosha kaa adhyayan kar anya bhaagon par uske prabhaav ko nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 The design of the 747 incorporates structural redundancy, additional aqueous systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces to address concerns related to safety and flyability

 Boeing has studied various 747 adaptations that could not go beyond the concept stage
 1960 ke dashak ke ant main or 1970 ke aarambh main, bowing ne chote el-1011 tristar or disi-10 kaa muqabla karne ke liye teen ingine vaale chote 747 ke vikaas kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 The payload, range and passenger capacity of the 747 trijet would have been higher
 The central engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct similar to the L-1011
 However, engineering studies showed that it would have been necessary to completely redesign the 747 wing
 Maintaining the same operational characteristics of the 747 would have been important to minimize the retraining of pilots
 Instead Boeing decided to buy a small four-engine 747, which resulted in the 747SP
 In the 1990s, the Boeing 777, a long-range twinjet aircraft smaller than the 747-400, entered service where the 747-300 was targeted
 1996 ke farnbaro airsho main bowing ne 747-500x or -600X kii ghoshnaa kii
 The proposed model would have combined the 747's fuselage with a new 251-foot extension wing derived from the 777
 Other changes included adding more powerful engines, increasing the number of tires on nose landing gear from four to four, and increasing the number of tires on the main landing gear from 16 to 20
 747-500x avadharana kii visheshta thi, badi hui dhad kii lambaai 18 feet se 250 feet lambii or vimaan ko, 10 lakh pound se adhik kul vajan ke saath, 462 yatriyon ko 8,700 notical mile kii seemaa tak le janaa tha
 The 747-600X concept was characterized by a large expansion of up to 279 feet with a seating capacity of 548 passengers, a flight range of 7,700 nautical miles and a total weight of 1
2 million pounds
 The third study concept, the 747-700X, combined the wing of the 747-600X with a wider fuselage to carry 650 passengers to the same range as the 747-400
 Changes from previous 747 models, especially for the 747-500x and -600X, the new wing was estimated to cost more than $ 5 billion
 vimaan kii shuruyaat karne ke liye bowing paryaapt ruchi ko aakarshith karne main sakasham nahin rahi
 As Airbus progressed with its A3XX study, Boeing in 2000 offered the market a 747 derivative as an option

 a new flight deck based on the 777's deck was used
 The 747X aircraft were supposed to carry 430 passengers to the 8,700 nautical mile limit
 747X ke vistaar ko 263 feet tak badhaayaa jaataa, taaki vah 500 yatriyon ko 7,800 notical mile kii saamaa tak le jaataa
 donon kaa abhyantar 777 kii parichaayak sanrachana par aadhaarit hota
 747X 747X vistaar ke malwahi sanskarnon kaa bhi adhyayan kiya gaya tha
 Like its predecessor, the 747X family was unable to generate enough interest to justify production, and was shelved with the 767-400ERX when Boeing announced the concept of the Sonic Cruiser in March 2001
 haalanki 747X dizin 747-500x or -600X kii tulana main kifayati tha, isaki maujuuda 747-400 se paryaapt unnati nahin karne ke liye aalochana kii gai thi
 The 747X did not progress beyond the drawing board, but the 747-400X evolved to production simultaneously and made the 747-400ER
 747X kaarykram ke ant ke baad, bowing ne 747 main kiye ja sakane vaale sudhaaron kaa adhyayan jari rakhaa
 747-400XQLR kaa lakshya badi hui seemaa 7,980 notical mile hasil karnaa, sudhaaron ke saath kushalta badhanaa or shor ko kam karnaa tha
 Improvements studied included molded wingtips similar to the wingtips used on the 767-400ER and sawtooth engines for noise reduction
 Although the 747-400XQLR did not reach production, many of its features were used in the 747 Advanced, which has been introduced as the 747-8

 a political party or political party is a political institution that tries to gain and maintain political power in governance
 iske liye praaia: vah chunaav kii prakriya main bhaag letaa he
 Political parties have their own principle or goal which is often in the form of written documents
 vibhinn deshon main raajnneetik dalon kii alag-alag sthiti va vyavastha he
 In some countries there is no political party
 kahin ek hi dal sarvesarva hota he
 Somewhere there are mainly two teams
 kintu bahut se deshon main do se adhik dal hote hai
 The place of political parties is very important as a central concept in a democratic political system
 rajnatik dal kisi samaaj vyavastha main shakti ke vitaran or satta ke aakankshi vyaktiyon evam samoohon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 They have been the principal means of tabulation, discipline and cohesion of conflicting interests
 is tarah se rajnatik dal samaaj vyavastha ke lakshyon, saamaajik gatishiltaa, saamaajik parivartanon, parivartanon ke avarodhon or saamaajik aandolanon se bhi sambandhit hote hai
 Political parties are studied by both sociologists and political scientists, but there is a substantial difference in their perspectives
 samajashastri rajnatik dal ko saamaajik samooh maanate hai jabaki raajnneetijna raajnneetik dalon ko aadhunik rajya main sarkaar banane kii ek pramukh sanstha ke rup main dekhte hai
 The structure of a political party has certain characteristics that distinguish it from other groups - uparyukt lakshanon dwaara raajnneetik dal ko anya sanghathan se bhinn karke dekh sakate hai
 The formation of a political party is found by two characteristics of social order - mauris duverjar ne raajnneetik dal ke saamaajik sanghathan kaa mahatvapurn vishleshan prastut kiya he
 They have tried to explain the organization of the party by four-point classification
 ye varg nimnlikhit hai- The caucus team can be said to be a small group of well-known people who are neither interested in their expansion nor their recruitment
 vastav main yah ek band samooh he
 The nature of which is semi-permanent
 keval chunaav ke samay hi cocks adhik sakriy hota he tathaa chunaavon ke bich ke samay main yah niskriy rahata he
 The low number of its members is not a measure of its power because the personal influence, power and capacity of its members is much higher than their number
 atah iske khyaati praapt sadasyon kii sankhya kii apeksha unka prabhaav evam kshamta adhik mahatvapurn he
 Duverger cited the French Radical Party and the pre-1918 British Labor Party as examples of this
 matadhikaar ke vistaar ke saath ‘cocks’ prakaar ke dal kaa hraas ho jaataa he
 The branch or branch team is the result of the expansion of the franchise into Parishmi Europe
 iskaa sambandh janata se hota he tathaa cocks kii tarah yah ek band samooh nahin he kyonki inamen gunon kii apeksha sankhya ko adhik mahatv diya jaataa he
 Therefore, it is always interested in recruiting more and more members
 inaki raajnneetik sankriyataayen keval chunaav tak hi simit nahin hoti apitu nirantar chalati rahati hai
 The branch is a larger group than the caucus, so its organization is more and it has more integration than the caucus
 isamen sanstaran tathaa karttavyon kaa vibhaajan suspasht hota he tathaa sthaniyata evam sankeernata kaa bhi abhas paaya jaataa he
 It has a mostly centralized party structure and the initial units are organized on a geographical basis like constituencies

 Catholic and conservative parties have more or less successfully followed it
 german soshal democratic party sanghathanaatmak aadhaar par is prakaar ke dal kaa ek acha udhaaharan he
 The third type of party organization described by Duvarzer is the bracket or cell which is a search for revolutionary communist parties
 yah branch kii apeksha kaaphi chota samooh hota he tathaa iskaa aadhaar bhugolic na hokar vyavsaayik hota he
 Due to the commercial basis, the cell has to bind all the members working in a place in one formula
 kaarkaana, workshop, daftar evam prashasan aadi iske ang ho sakate hai
 Since SAIL is a group of members who are engaged in the same occupation and who meet daily hours of work, party members have higher party unity
 vaiyaktik cell kaa anya selon se koi pratyaksh sambandh nahin hota he
 The organization of a cell is essentially conspiratorial and its manufacturing style ensures that the entire team-structure is in danger when a cell is destroyed because there is no contact between individual units at the same level
 yah gupt sakriyata ke liye sabase upyukt madhyam he
 Its covert activities are primarily political and more important to members
 maton ko jeetne, pratinidhiyon ke samoohan tathaa matadaataaon ke pratinidhiyon se sampark rakhane kii apeksha cell dal sangharsh, prachaar, anushaasan tathaa agar anivaary to gupt sakriyata kaa ek madhyam he
 They have a tendency to recognize the importance of the second grade of winning elections
 praja tantric kendravaad kii dharna dal ke sabhi pahaluon par kendrikrut niyantran sthapit kar detii he jiskaa udhaaharan 1917 se pehle leninvaadee dal tha
 Duverger also indicates hostility towards the cell structure among members of the French Communist Party
 duverjar kaa dal-sanghathan kaa chauthaa prakaar milicia prakaar kaa sanghathan he
 It is a type of private army whose members are recruited like soldiers and have to be disciplined and trained like a military organization
 isaki sanrachana bhi sainik sanrachana ke samaan hoti he arthath iske sadsy sena kii tarah tukadiyon, companiyon or bataliyanon se sangathit hote hai
 The militia assumes maximum military characteristics
 milicia kii chunaav tathaa sansadeey gatividhiyon main koi ruchi nahin hoti kyonki yah prajatantreey vyavastha ko majboot karne kii apeksha ise ukhaad phenkane kaa ek moulik saadhan he
 Just as SAIL is a communist discovery, so is the search for militia revolutionaries
 hitler ke akraami sainik or musolini kii krantikari milicia is prakaar kii sanrachana kaa udhaaharan hai
 Towards them, Duverger indicates that no political party has ever been formed on the basis of militia alone
 jis sangathit rup main raajnneetik dal aaj hamaare saamne vidyaman hai, us rup main unka itihaas adhik pracheen nahin he
 They have their origins in the nineteenth century, but even before that some organizations created by humans have been instrumental in building public opinion and sending demands to the rulers even if not directly from the government
 aadhunik samaaj main raajnneetik dalon kaa gathan vividh aadhaaron par kiya gaya he
 Psychological underpinnings are inherent trends in the formation of political parties
 mataiky evam sanghathan maanav swabhaav kii do pramukh pravritiyaan hai
 Individuals with similar temperament and values get organized and form a political party and then try to maintain those values
 british kanzarvative dal kaa gathan roodhiwaadee vyavastha ko banaaye rakhane ke samarthak vyaktiyon dwaara kiya gaya he
 Some people want to bring changes in the conservative system and form liberal parties to fulfill this purpose, while some form reactionary parties on the basis of the desire to reiterate the bygone era
 maanav itihaas main dharm kii raajnneeti main mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he tathaa aaj bhi anek deshon main dharmik netaa evam padaadhikari pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se raajnneeti main hastkshep karte hai
 Religion plays a major role in the social organization of political parties
 udaahranarth bharat main muslim lig, akali dal, jansangh, hindu mahasabha jaise dalon ke saamaajik sanghathan main dharm kendriya bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Regionalism or territoriality is also a major basis in the formation of political parties
 pradeshik hiton kii raksha ke liye tathaa pradeshik samasyaon ke sheeghra niptaare ke liye kuch pradeshik dalon kaa nirmaan hota he
 DMK, Telangana Praja Samiti, Assam Gana Parishad, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha etc
 in India
 raajnneetik dal aarthik yaa vargeey aadhaaron par bhi sangathit hote hai
 According to Marx, the correlation between political parties and classes is the central point of the theory of state and politics
 anek anveshanon se hamen yah pataa chalata he ki vargeey hit, daleey sambaddhtaon tathaa nirvachanon kii pasand ke bich ghanishtha sambandh he tathaa adhikansh samaaj main raajnneetik dal nirvaachak vargeey hiton kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Labor parties in Britain, labor parties in India, peasant unions etc
 jati, bhartiya samaaj kii aadharbhoot visheshta he
 Caste has always influenced the social organization of political parties in India
 swatantrata se purv jati mukti kaa aandolan rajnatik dalon ke gathan ko prabhavit karnaa rahaa he
 The Dalit class welfare league, the excluded Hitakarini Sabha, the Justice Party are prime examples
 swatantrata ke pashchaat nirvachan pratiyogita main ‘jati’ rajnatik gatishiltaa laane vaala pramukh saamaajik aadhaar ban gaya
 'ethnic fusion' and 'ethnic fragmentation' began to play a central role in political processes
 sabhi rajnatik dal jaateey gananaa ke aadhaar par ummidavaaron ko tay karne lage
 At the present time, ethnic basis is the main basis for formation of political parties
 samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party, rashtriya janata dal, janata dal united aadi iske pramukh udhaaharan hai
 Ideology also plays a major role in party organization
 samaajawaadee, leninvaadee or maovadi vichaardhaaraon par aadhaarit anek dalon kaa nirmaan bhartiya raajnneeti kii pramukh visheshta rahi he

 In thermodynamics and physicochemical, thermodynamics is the study of the energy produced or exploited in a chemical reaction
 ushmarsayan main praaia: urja ke shoshan yaa utsarjan ke parinamswaroop hone vaale bhautik parivartan aadi) kaa bhi adhyayan shaamil he
 Along with this, heat capacity, heat of combustion, heat of manufacture, enthalpy and free energy are also calculated
 saadharantaya kisi pratikriya main kshepit yaa shoshit ushma ko uske sameekaran dwaara vyakt kar dete hai
 for example : H2 + Cl2 = 2hcl + 44,000 calories It is dissolved that when combining with 1 gram-molecule hydrogen gas and 1 gram-molecule chlorine gas, when 2 gram-molecule hydrochloric acid gas is formed, 44,000 calories of heat are lost
 isi prakaar nimnaankit sameekaran dekhie : H2 + I2 = 2hcl - 11,860 calories dwaara yah prakat hota he ki yadi 2 gram hydrogen tathaa 254 gram iodine gas ke sangyojan se 256 gram hydrogen iodide gas banaai jaae to is pratikriya main 11,860 calories ushma shoshit hogi
 It is clear that the amount of heat absorbed in any activity will depend on the physical state of the substances participating in it; That is why it is also written
 bhautik avasthaa kaa jo prabhaav pratikriya-ushma par padataa he vah nimnaankit udhaaharan se spasht ho jayega : And dwitiya sameekaran main ushma kii kshepit maatra pratham samikarnon kii apeksha adhik he kyonki isamen 18 gram bhaap ke dravit hone main kshepit ushma kii maatra sammilit he
 For reactions in which the volume of the reactors also changes, the reaction heat will also depend on whether the reaction is done at constant volume or at constant pressure
 yadi pratikriya karte samay aaytan sthir rakhaa jaae, to mandal ko bahya daab ke viruddh kuch kaary nahin karnaa padataa
 Therefore, at constant volume, the real energy of the reaction is absorbed or absorbed
 parantu yadi kriya karte samay daab ko sthir rakhte hue aaytan ko badhane yaa ghatane diya jaae, to pratikriya-ushma kaa yatharth maan gyaat nahin hoga
 for example; In increasing the volume, the board works against external pressure, which will have energy expenditure; Therefore, if the reaction is exothermic, the amount of radiation will be reduced at this stage
 saadhaarant: pratikriyaaon kii ushma sthir aaytan par hi naapi jaati he
 From the thermodynamic point of view, reactions are often divided into several classes and are named reaction-heat to suit the reaction nature - such as solution-heat, dilution-heat, production-heat, combustion-heat, and relaxation-heat
 kisi viley ko vilaayak main gholne par praaia: ushma kaa kshepan hota he
 The salts that react with water to form hydrated salts, most of the heat is absorbed when they dissolve
 anya lavenon ke ghulne main kshepit ushma kii maatra bahut kam he
 The amount of energy absorbed or absorbed when a gram-molecule of a substance is dissolved in a solvent is called solution-heat
 iske atirikt sandra vilyan ko tanu karne main bhi ushma main parivartan hota he or ise vilyan kii tanukaran-ushma kehete hai
 The volume of dilution-heat decreases with the dilution of the solutions and can be considered as zero for more dilute solutions
 aise tanu vilyanon kii ushmarsayan main "jaleey" kehete hai
 for example; Potassium nitrate dissolves in water to form a highly concentrated solution, so its solution heat is 8,500 calories
 is tathy ko nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara vyakt kar sakate hai : The amount of heat that is absorbed or absorbed in the formation of a gram-molecule of a compound by the addition of element elements is called the production-heat of that compound
 udhaaharan ke liye nimnaankit samikarnon dwaara spasht he ki carbon dioxide, methen, tathaa nitric amla kii utpaadan-ushma kramnusaar 94
4, 18
8 tathaa 42
4 calories he : Production heat can also be negative, such as: aavyav tatwon se jin yogicon ke banane main ushma kshepit hoti he unhen ushmakshepak yogic kehete hai or jin yogicon ke banane main ushma shoshit hoti he unhen ushmashoshak yogic kehete hai
 Most compounds are exothermic, such as hydrogen, chloride, water, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, lead chloride, etc
 are all exothermic compounds
 ushmashoshak yogicon ke udhaaharan hydrogen iodide, carbon dicelaphid, aesetilin, ozone aadi die ja sakate hai
 Thermodynamic compounds are much less stable than exothermic compounds and are easily dissected into their elemental elements
 ushmakshepak or ushmashoshak yogicon ke sthayitv kaa uparyukt bhed unamem antarnihit urja ke antar ke kaaran hota he
 for example; When 1 gram-molecule of carbon dioxide is formed by combining 1 gram-molecule carbon and 1 gram-molecule oxygen, 94,300 calories of heat are absorbed
 spasht he ki apane avyav tatwon kii apeksha 1 gram-anu carbon dioxide main 94,300 calories urja kam hogi
 Similarly, in a calorific compound like carbon disulfide, it will have 22,000 calories more energy than its element elements
 yadi samast tatwon kii antarnihit urja ko shunya maan liya jaae, to upyukt vivechan se spasht he ki yogicon kii antarrihit urja unki utpaadan ushma ke baraabar hogi; parantu yadi utpaadan urja rinatmak he to antarnihit urja dhanatmak hogi or iske vipareet yadi utpaadan ushma dhanatmak ho, to antarnihit urja rinatmak hogi
 For example, the underlying energies of carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide would be equal to 94,300 and 22,000 calories respectively
 kisi tatv yo yogic kii 1 gram-anu maatra ko oxigen main sthir aaytan par purnataya jalaane se ushma kii jo maatra kshepit hoti he, use us tatv yaa yogic kii dahan-ushma kehete hai
 For example, it is clear from the following equation that combustion-heat of methane is 2,12,800 calories: carbon ko oxigen main jalaane par do yogicon kaa bananaa sambhav he- It is worth noting that the combustion heat of carbon is 94,300 calories, not 26,000 calories, because carbon is completely burned or oxidized in the first act itself
 duusari kriya main carbon, carbon monoksaide main parivartit ho gaya he, parantu abhi uskaa dahan purna nahin hua kyonki carbon monoksaide kaa or dahan karke use carbon dioxide main oxykrut kiya ja saktaa he
 a special type of colorimeter is used to find combustion heat called bomb-colorimeter
 vaigyanik barthelon ne ise sarvapratham 1881 main banaaya tha
 This gunmetal is made of steel and is of cylinder shape
 iske aantarik tal par ek vishesh prakaar kaa inaimal chadhaa rahata he, jisase usapar oxigen kii koi kriya nahin hoti
 It has strong screws to firmly close the lid
 jis padaarth kii dahan-ushma nikaalnaa ho uski ek nishchit maatra platinum kii pyaali "pa" main le lee jaati he or bam main lagbhag 20-25 vayumandaleey daab par oxigen bhar lete hai
 After this, close the vam firmly and keep it in an ordinary colorimeter
 saadhaaran calorimapak main jal kii ek nishchit maatra le lee jaati or prayog dwaara pehle hi yah nirdhaarit kar liya jaataa he ki is calorimapak main jal ke taap ko 1 degree centegrade badhaane ke liye kitni ushma kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The temperature of the water is measured in the external colorimeter
 ab platinum ke taron a tathaa a dwaara lohe ke ek maheen taar t main vidyut pravaahit karte hai
 The wire becomes red by heating the current and the substance placed in the cup starts to oxidize
 lohe ke taar ke jalane main tathaa oxikaran kii is kriya main ushma kshepit hoti he, jisaki maatra bahya calorimapak main upasthit jal ke taap main vruddhi se gyaat kar lee jaati he
 The amount of heat absorbed by combustion of a substance can be found by subtracting the heat absorbed by the burning of iron from the amount of heat obtained from this experiment
 spasht he ki is prayog main mandal kaa aaytan sthir rahata he; atev is vidhi se kisi padaarth kii dahan-ushma nirdhaarit kii ja sakati he
 The amount of heat that is coated when a gram-equivalent amount of alkali is relaxed by a gram-equivalent amount of acid is called senescence-heat
 yadi amla tathaa kshar itane tanu vilyanon main liye jaaen ki ve purnataya yanon main vighatit hon to shithilikaran kii kriya keval hydrogen tathaa hydroxil yanon ke sanyog se avighatit anu banane kii kriya hogi
 Therefore, in dilute solutions, the heat of relaxation of strong bases by all strong acids will be the same
 prayog dwaara is ushma kaa maan 13,700 calories aata he
 Hence, the relaxation of strong alkali by strong acids can be expressed by the following equations: jahaan x koi mulak he or m koi dhaatu he, Ie arthath But if acid or alkali is weak, it will not completely dissolve in the dilute solution
 atev aise amlon yaa kshaaron kii shithilikaran ushma 13,700 calories nahin aegi
 For example, ionization heat of ammonium hydroxide is -1,500 calories, so ammonium hydroxide and the relaxing heat of a strong acid will be 12,200 calories
 prayog dwaara shithilikaran ushma ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye saadhaarant: ek tharmas flask main kshar ke tanu vilyan kii ek nishchit maatra lekar flask ko sthir tapawale jal main dubaakar rakhte hai, jisase vikiran dwaara flask ke bheetar vilyan ke taap main antar na ho
 Now, by taking equivalent amount of acid in the solution, the temperature of the bunu is equal to the temperature of the base
 amla kaa taap sthir ho jane par use shighrata se kshar main mila dete hai
 The highest temperature of the solution is measured by running a solution of a boiler
 ab yadi mishra vilyan kii maatra, uski vishisht-ushma, taap, prayukt flask kii ushmadharita gyaat ho, to shithilikaran kriya main kshepit ushma kii maatra sugamawa se gyaat kii ja sakati he
 By the same method, the salts-heat of salts can also be removed easily
 ushma-rasayan kaa sabase pramukh niyam swiss vaigyanik jarmen henry hes ne san 1840 main pratipaadit kiya tha
 According to this rule, hes kaa niyam ushma-rasayan main bahut upyogi siddh hua he
 With this help, heat-changes in non-direct reactions can also be removed indirectly
 udhaaharan ke liye; saadhaarant: carbonic yogicon kii utpaadan-ushma pratyaksh kriya dwaara nahin nikaali ja sakati, parantu carbonic yogic tathaa iske avyav tatwon kii dahan-ushma ko nirdhaarit karke yogic kii utpaadan-ushma hes ke niyam se nikaal sakate hai
 Energy derived from chemical activities has been the means of running our industries
 aaj kritrim upgrah ke yug main jab maanav chandramaa tathaa anya grahon kii yatra main prayatnsheel he to aise idhano kii khoj aavashyak ho gai he jinaki sookshm se sookshm maatra adhik tam urja de sake
 Boron compounds are proving very useful in this direction, because they have higher combustion heat than the same amount of carbon compounds and they are able to give us more energy
 ushmarsayan ke anya upyog bahut kaal se hote aae hai
 For example, the first table shows the highest production-heat of aluminum oxide
 isi gun kaa upyog golddeshmit kii ushman vidhi main kiya gaya he
 Reaction due to the high heat-production of aluminum oxide, main itani adhik ushma kshepit hoti he ki mandal kaa taap lagbhag 3,000 centegrade tak pahunch jaataa he or loha tak pigal jaataa he
 Thus the broken rail tracks can also be joined by melting the broken parts of heavy machines with the help of the above mentioned action

 Arabic: علي ابن أبي طالب ali ibne abi talib kaa janm 17 march 600 musalamaanon ke tirth sthal kaaba ke andar hua tha
 He was the brother-in-law and brother-in-law of Prophet Muhammad and his popular name is Hazrat Ali
 ve musalamaanon ke khalipha ke rup main jane jate hai
 He ruled from 656 to 661 as the fourth caliph of Rashidun Khilafat, and according to Shia Islam, he was the first Imam from 632 to 661
 iske atirikt unhen pehla muslim vaigyanik bhi mana jaataa he
 He gave scientific information in a very interesting manner to the common man
 abu talib or fatima bin asad ke liye paidaa hue, kai shastreey islamic ke anusaar, islam main sabase pavitra sthaan makka main kaaba ke pavitra abhayaarany main paidaa hone vaala ali akelaa vyakti he
 Sources, especially Shia ones
 ali pehla purush tha jisane islam ko sweekaar kiya, or kuch lekhakon ke mutabik pehla muslim tha
 Ali protected Muhammad from an early age and took part in almost all the battles fought by the nascent Muslim community
 madina main jane ke baad, usne mohammad kii beti fatima se vivaah kiya
 After the assassination of Caliph Uthman ibn Afan, he was appointed a caliph by Muhammad's companions in 656
 ali ke shasankaal main naagarik yuddh hue or 661 main, do dinon baad shahid hone ke kaaran kupha ke mahaan masjid main prarthana karte hue kharijite ne un par hamalaa kiya or hatya kar di 
 Ali is important for both Shia and Sunni politically and spiritually
 ali ke bare main kai jeevani strot aksar sampradayik rekhaon ke anusaar pakshpatpurna hote hai, lekin ve is baat se sahamat hai ki vah ek pavitra muslim tha, jo islam ke kaaran or quran or sunnat ke anusaar ek shaasha tha
 While Sunis consider Ali the fourth and final of the Rashidun Caliph, Shia Muslims consider Ali as the first Imam after Muhammad because of his interpretation of events in the Ghadir Khum
 shiya muslim bhi maanate hai ki ali or anya shiya imam ke sadsy hai) mohammad ke liye sahi uttaradhikari hai 
 It was a disagreement that the ummah was divided into Shia and Sunni branches
 ali ke pita, abu talib, shaktishaalee kuraishi janajati kii ek mahatvapurn shakha banu hashim ke kaaba ke sangrakshak the or ek shaikh the
 He was also an uncle of Muhammad, and raised Muhammad after Abdul Muttalib
 ali kii maa fatima bin asad bhi banu hashim se sambandhit thim, jisase ali ibaihim ibrahim ke putr ke vanshaj the

 unhone gadir khum main kaaravaan ruk gai, sampradayik prarthana ke liye lautne vaale tirthayatriyon ko ikattha kiya or unhen sambodhit karnaa shuru kar diya
 According to the Encyclopedia of Islam: shiya in mukhyalayon ko mohammad ke uttaradhikari or pehle imam ke rup main ali ke padnaam ke rup main maanate hai; iske vipareet, sunni unhen keval mohammad or ali ke bich ghanishtha aadhyatmik sambandhon kii abhivyakti ke rup main lete hai, or unki ichha ke anusaar ali, unke chachere bhai or damaad ke rup main, unki mrityu par unki paariwarik jimmedaariyon kaa uttaradhikari he, lekin jaruri nahin ki unka pad raajnneetik adhikaar kai sufi is prakaran ko ali ke liye mohammad kii aadhyatmik shakti or adhikaar ke hastantaran ke rup main bhi samajhate hai, jinhen ve vaili sam utkrushtataa ke rup main maanate hai

 After uniting the Arab tribes into a Muslim religious polity in the last years of his life, Muhammad's death in 632 led to disagreements over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community
 jabaki ali or baaki mohammad ke kareebi parivaar apane sharir ko dafnane ke liye dho rahe the, jabaki sakifa main muslimon ke ek chote samooh ne bhaag liya, ek mohammad ke kareebi saathi abu bakar ko samudaay ke netritv ke liye namit kiya gaya tha
 Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph
 abu bakar kii pasand mohammad ke kuch saathi ne vivaadit kii thi, jinhone kaha tha ki ali ko mohammad ne apane uttaradhikari ko namit kiya tha

 agar ali isse pehle hamaare paas aae the, to ham nishchit rup se use tyaag nahin paaenge
 Ali said, 'was it appropriate that we should quarrel with the Caliph before the Prophet was buried?' khilaafat ke chunaav ke baad, abu bakar or umr kuch anya saathi ke saath fatima ke ghar gaye or ali or unke samarthakon ko majaboor karne ke liye majaboor kiya jo abu bakar ko apana nishtha dene ke liye ikatthe hue the

 lekin abu bakar ne inkaar kar diya or unase kaha ki bhavishyavaktaaon ke paas koi viraasat nahin he or fadak muslim samudaay se sambandhit tha
 Abu Bakr said to him, "the Apostle of Allah said, We have no successors, everything we leave is Sadaka
 " umm ayman ke saath milakar, ali ne is tathy kii gavaahi di ki mohammad ne ise fatima jehar ko diya, jab abu bakar ne unase apane daawey ke liye gavaahon ko bulaava dene kaa anurodh kiya
 Fatima became angry and stopped talking to Abu Bakr, and he kept following the attitude until she died
 'aisha ne yah bhi kaha ki "jab allaah ke preshit kii mrityu ho gai, to unki patniyon ne uthman ko abu bakar ko bhejne ke liye kaha ki vah viraasat ke apane hisse ke liye kahen

 Ali rejected the third condition while Uthman accepted it

 At this time, Ali acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him

 He told Uthman about criticisms of other allies and acted as negotiator on behalf of Uthman with provincial opponents who had come to Medina; This seems to have caused some mistrust between Ali and Uthman's family

 muslim itihaas main sabase kathin avadhi main se ek ke dauraan, ali 656 or 661 ke bich khalipha tha, jo ki pehle fitnh ke saath bhi hua tha
 Since the conflicts in which Ali was involved were perpetuated in polar communal historiography, biographical material is often biased
 lekin sutara is baat se sahamat hai ki vah ek gahan dharmik vyakti tha, jo islam ke kaaran or quran or sunnat ke anusaar nyaay kaa shashan tha; vah dharmik kartavyon ke maamle main musalamaanon ke khilaaf yuddh main lage the

 Uthman's assassination meant that the rebels had to choose a new caliphate
 yah kathinaaiyon se mulaakaat kii kyonki vidrohiyon ko muhjirun, ansaar, misravasi, kufaan or basrite samet kai samoohon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha 
 There were three candidates: Ali, Talhah and al-zubair
 sabase pehle vidrohiyon ne ali se sampark kiya, chauthe khalif hone ke liye unhen anurodh karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Some of Muhammad's companions tried to persuade Ali to accept office, but he turned down the offer, suggesting to be a consultant rather than a chief
 talha, jubayre or anya saathi ne khalipha ke vidrohiyon ke prastaav se inkaar kar diya
 Therefore, the rebels warned the residents of Medina to elect a caliphate within a day, or they would implement drastic action
 dedlock ko hal karne ke liye, muslim al-masjid en- naabavi main 18 june, 656 ko khalipha niyukt karne ke liye ekatra hue 
 Initially, 'ali refused to accept it, as only his most powerful supporters were rebels
 haalanki, jab madina ke nivaasiyon ke alaava mohammad ke kuch ullekhneey saathi ne unhen prastaav sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya, to vah antat sahamat hue
 According to Abu Mekhnaf's narration, Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge to 'ali, but other legends claimed otherwise that he was forced to give his vows
 iske alaava, talhah or ez-jubayre ne baad main daawa kiya ki unhone unhen anichhaa se samarthan diya he
 Regardless, Ali rejected these claims, insisting that they recognized them as sloppy
 wilferd madelang kaa maananaa he ki bal ne logon se pratigya dene kaa aagrah nahin kiya or unhone masjid main saarvajanik rup se vachan diya
 While many of the rebels, along with the population of Medina, gave their vows, some important figures or tribes did not

 Soon after becoming Ali Khalifa, he rejected the provincial governors whom Uthman had appointed, replacing them with trusted allies
 unhone mugira ebn shuba or ebn abbaas ke vakil ke khilaaf kaam kiya, jinhone unhen saavdhaanee se apane shashan ke saath aage badhane kii salaah di thi
 Madelung states that Ali was deeply convinced of his authority and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for political expediency, and to fight against overwhelming odds
 uthman ke sansthaapak muvayah pratham or levent ke governor ne ali ke adeshon ko prastut karne se inkaar kar diya; vah aisa karne vaala ekmaatr rajyapal tha
 Ali's name with Islamic calligraphy in Hagia Sophia, when he was appointed Caliph, told the citizens of Medina that Muslim politics had suffered from dissent and controversy; He wanted to purify Islam of any evil

 Aisha, Talha, al-zubair and the Umayyads, especially Mu'awiyah e and Marvan I, wanted to punish the rioters who had killed 'ali Uthman
 unhone basra ke kareeb deraa daalaa
 The talks lasted for several days and were later sparked by protests during the heated exchange and parley, leading to loss of life on both sides
 bhram main oont kii ladaai 656 main shuru hui, jahaan ali vijayi ho gaya
 Some historians believe that he used the issue to find his political ambitions because he found Ali's caliphate against his advantage
 vidrohiyon ne kaha ki quran or sunnat ke anusaar shashan nahin karne ke liye uthman ko maar daalaa gaya tha, isliye koi pratishodh nahin kiya janaa tha
 Some say that the Khalifa was the gift of the rebels and that Ali did not have enough force to control or punish them, while others say that Ali accepted the rebels' argument or at least did not consider Uthman a ruler
 Ruler
 aisi paristhitiyon main, ek vivaad hua jisane muslim itihaas main pehla grih yuddh shuru kiya
 Some Muslims, known as Uthmanis, considered Uthman to be a rightful and just caliph until the end, who was killed illegally
 kuch anya, jinhen ali kii party ke naam se janaa jaataa he, kaa maananaa tha ki uthman galati main gir gaya tha, unhone khalipha ko jabt kar liya tha or kanoonee tareeke se apane tareeke se sudhaarney yaa kadam uthaane ke inkaar karne ke liye kanoon main nishpadit kiya tha; is prakaar ali sirf sahi or sachche imam the or unke virodhiyon main naastik
 This was not Ali's position himself
 is grih yuddh ne muslim samudaay ke bheetar sthaayee vibhaajan banaae, jinke paas khalipha par kabja karne kaa vaid adhikaar tha
 The First Fitna, 656–661, continued after Uthman's assassination, during Ali's caliphate, and was abolished by the Caliph's notion of Mu'awiya
 is grih yuddh islamic ummeh kii praarambhik ekta ke ant ke rup main khed he
 Ali appointed 'abd Allah ibn al-abbas, the governor of Basra and moved his capital to the Muslim garrison city of Kufa in Iraq
 baad roman-farsi yudhon or bijantin saasaani yuddh ki saikadon varshon se chali, vahaan iraq ke bich gahari jaden matbhed, aupchaarik rup se farsi main the sassanid samrajya or syria aupchaarik rup se ke tahat bijantin samrajya
 The Iraqis wanted the newly established Islamic State capital to be in Kufa so that they could bring in revenue to their territory and oppose Syria
 unhone ali ko kupha main aane or iraq main kupha main rajdhani sthapit karne ke liye aashwast kiya
 Later Muawiyah I, the governor of the Levant and cousin of Uthman, refused Ali's demands for loyalty
 ali ne apane nishtha ko waapas paane kii ummiido ko kholaa, lekin muvayah ne apane shashan ke tahat levent swaittata par jor diya
 Muawiyah refused to pay tribute to Ali by mobilizing his Levantine supporters and saying that his party did not participate in his election
 ali ne apni senaaon ko uttar main sthanantarit kar diya or donon senaayen ek sau se adhik dinon tak cyphin main khud ko deraa daale, zyaadaatar samay baatcheet main bitaai gai
 Although Ali exchanged several letters with Mu'awiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuaded him to pledge allegiance
 partiyon ke bich takaraav ne 657 main cyphin kii ladaai kaa netritv kiya
 After a violent battle known as Lalit al-harir after a week of fighting, Mu'awiyah's army was on the point of passage when Amr ibn al-aas advised Mu'awiyah to pounce his troops
 
 ali ne stratage ke madhyam se dekha, lekin keval ek alpsankhyak ladaai kaa peechha karnaa chahta tha
 Eventually the two armies agreed to settle who should be the caliph through mediation
 ladane ke liye ali kii sena main sabase bada block kaa inkaar karnaa madhyasthata kii sweekruti main nirnaayak kaarak tha
 The question is whether the arbitrator will represent Ali or Kufan, with further division in Ali's army
 ashath ebn kyuu or kuch anya ne ali ke ummidavaaron ko 'abd allaah ebn' abbaas or malik al- ashtar ko khaarij kar diya, or abu musa ashaari par apni tatasthta ke liye jor diya
 Finally, Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa
 amrit ebn al- e ko muvayah ne madhyasth ke rup main niyukt kiya tha
 Seven months later the two mediators met in Jordan 658, 10 miles northwest of Mann, in Jordan
 amrit ebn al- abu musa ashaari ne aashwast kiya ki ali or muvayah donon ko kadam uthaanaa chahie or ek nayaa khalipha chune jane chahie
 Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision, which reduced the caliphate to the status of rebel Mu'awiyah
 isliye ali ko muvayah or amrit ebn al-es ne bulaayaa tha
 When the arbitrators gathered at daumit-ul-jandal, a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss matters
 jab khalipha ke bare main nirnay lene ke liye samay aayaa, amrit bin al-aas ne abu musa al-ashaari ko is baat kaa manoranjan karne main vishwaas dilaayaa ki unhen khalipha ke ali or muvaaya donon ko vanchit karnaa chahie, or musalamaanon ko chunaav karne kaa adhikaar dena chahie khalipha abu musa al-ashaari ne tadnusaar kaary karne kaa bhi faisla kiya
 According to Punawala, it appears that the arbitrators and other eminent persons met in January 659 to discuss the selection of the new Caliph, with the exclusion of the arbitrators
 amrit ne muvayah kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki abu musa ne apane damaad abdulla ebn umr ko pasand kiya, lekin baad vaale ne sarvasammati se chunaav ke liye khadey hone se inkaar kar diya
 Abu Musa proposed, and Amrit agreed, to leave both Ali and Mu'awiyah and submit a selection of the new Caliph to Shura
 abu musa ke baad saarvajanik ghoshnaa main samjhaute ke apane hisse ko dekha gaya, lekin amrit ne ali ko ghoshit kar diya or muvaaya ko khalipha ke rup main pushti kii
 Ali refused to accept his decision and found it technically in breach of his pledge to hold elections and to follow arbitration
 'ali ne virodh kiya, yah bataate hue ki yah quran or sunnat ke vipareet taur isliye badhyakaari nahin tha
 He then tried to organize a new army, but the Qasr's remnant Ansar, led by Malik Ashtar, and some of his clans remained loyal
 isane ali ko apane samarthakon ke bich bhi ek kamjor sthiti main daal diya
 Mediation resulted in the disintegration of 'ali's alliance, and some have stated that this was Muawiyah's intention
 ali ke shivi main sabase mukhar virodhiyon ne vahi log the jinhone ali ko yudhviram main majaboor kar diya tha
 He broke through Ali's force, rallying under resentment "mediation belongs to God alone
 " is samooh ko kharijiyon ke rup main janaa jane laga
 He considered everyone his enemy
 65 9 main ali kii sena or kharijiyon ne naharvan kii ladaai main mulaakaat kii
 The Qurra then came to be known as Kharijites
 tab kharijiyon ne ali ke samarthakon or anya muslimon kii hatya shuru kar di
 He considered someone who was not part of his group as an unbeliever
 haalanki 'ali ne ek bade antar se ladaai jiti, phir bhi nirantar sangharsh unki sthiti ko prabhavit karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 While dealing with the Iraqis, Ali found it difficult to build a disciplined army and effective state institutions
 unhone kharijiyon se ladane main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 As a result, 'ali found it difficult to expand the kingdom on its eastern front
 lagbhag usee samay, misr main ashaanti paidaa ho rahi thi
 The governor of Egypt, Qais, was recalled, and Ali replaced him with Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr
 muvayah ne misr ko jeetne ke liye 'amrit ebn al' kii anumati di or amrit ne safaltaapurvak aisa kiya
 Amrit first took Egypt eighteen years before the Romans but was dismissed by Uthman
 mohammad ebn abi bakar ke paas misr main koi lokapriy samarthan nahin tha or 2000 purushon ke saath milakar kaamyaab rahe lekin ve bina ladaai ke fail gaye
 In the following years, Mu'awiyah's army captured many cities in Iraq, which Ali's governors could not stop, and the people did not support him to fight with them
 muvayah ne misr, hijaaj, yaman or anya kshetron ko parajeet kiya
 In the last year of Ali's caliphate, the mood in Kufa and Basra changed in their favor as people became confused with Mu'awiyah's reign and policies
 haalanki, ali ke prati logon kaa ravaiya gaharaai se bhinn tha
 Only a small minority of them believed that Ali was the best Muslim after Muhammad and was only entitled to rule over them, while the majority supported him because of his mistrust and opposition to Mu'awiyah
 kaha jaataa he ki ali ne uthman kii maut ke baad khalipha main safal hone ke liye janata dwaara dabaae jane ke baad khalipha ke rankon main vittiya bhrashtachar or anuchit visheshadhikaron ke khilaaf ek asangat abhiyaan kii shapath lee or aagaah kiya
 The Shias argue that despite their unpopularity with the elite, their determination to push these reforms has been a cause of enmity from the rich and privileged former companions of the Prophet
 apane governor malik ashtar ko ek prasiddh patr main, unhone apane samarthak garib virdohi virdohi drushtikon ko vyakt kiya: Remember that dislike and disapproval of ordinary men, acceptance of important persons and resentment of some of the larger ones do not bother more people than imbalances, if the general public and public relations of your subject are happy with you

 'ali refrained from nepotism, including his brother' Aqeel ibn Abu Talib

 Ali succeeded in forming a broad coalition, especially after the Battle of Camel
 karon or lut ke baraabar vitaran kii unki niti ne mohammad ke saathi, vishesh rup se ansaar kaa samarthan praapt kiya, jo mohammad, paaramparik janajaatiy netaaon or kurra yaa kuranik pathakon ke baad kuraishi netritv dwaara adhinsth the, jo pavitra islamic netritv kii maang karte the
 The successful formation of this diverse alliance is due to the charismatic character of Ali
 is vividh gathbandhan ko shiya ali ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jiskaa arth he "party" yaa "ali kaa gut"
 However, according to Shia as well as non-shia reports, 'ali supported Ali after his election to support him as the Caliph, the royalists were politically royal, not religiously
 yadhyapi is samay kai log raajnneetik shiya ke rup main gine gaye the, unamem se kuch ali ke dharmik netritv par vishwaas karte the
 His policies and views of governance are revealed in a letter sent to Malik al-ashtar after the appointment of the governor of Egypt
 is nirdesh, jise aitihaasik rup se madina ke samvidhan ke saath islamic shashan ke liye adarsh samvidhan ke rup main dekha gaya he, us samay shaasha or rajya ke vibhinn kaaryakartaaon or samaaj ke mukhya virgon ke kartavyon or adhikaron kaa vistrut vivaran shaamil tha
 Ali wrote in his instructions to Malik al-ashtar: chunki 'ali ke adhikansh log nammaatr or kisaan the, isliye vah krishi se chintit the
 He instructed Malik to pay more attention to the development of land than to the collection of tax, because the tax can only be derived from the development of land and anyone who asks for tax without developing land would have ruined the country
 Is and destroys people
 mukhya lekh: ali kii hatya On 19 Ramadan AH 40, which would correspond to 27 January 661, Ali was attacked by Kharijite abd-al-rahman ibn Muljam while praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa
 fajr prarthana main veshya karte hue vah ebn mulajam kii jehar se lepit talwaar se ghayal ho gaye the
 'ali orders his sons not to attack the Kharijites, but rather determines that Ibn Muljam will be pardoned if he survives, whereas if he died, Ibn Muljam would receive only a similar hit
 must be given 
 'do din baad 29 janvari 661 par ali kii mrityu ho gai
 al-hasan fulfilled the Qais and gave equal punishment to Ibn Muljam on Ali's death
 ali kii maut ke baad, kufi muslimon ne vivaad ke bina apane sabase bade bete hasan ke prati nishtha kaa vachan diya, kyonki kai avasaron par ali ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki mohammad sadan ke log muslim samudaay par shashan karne ke hakdaar the
 At this time, Mu'awiyah kept both the Levant and Egypt and, as commander of the greatest force in the Muslim Empire, declared himself the caliph and marched his army to the seat of Hasan's caliphate
 yuddh shuru hua jiske dauraan muvayah ne dhire-dhire hasan kii sena ke generalon or cmanderon ko badi maatra main paise or vaade ko dhokhaa diya jab tak sena ne unke khilaaf vidroh nahin kiya
 Eventually, Hasan was forced to make peace and produce Kuwaifa in Muawiyah
 is tarah muvayah ne islamic khalipha par kabja kar liya or ise ek dharmanirpeksh samrajya main tun kiya
 The Umayyad Caliphate later became a centralized monarchy by Abd al-malik ibn Marwan
 umayyaad ne har sambhav tareeke se ali ke parivaar or shiya par gambhir dabaav daalaa
 The regular public curse of Imam Ali in congregational prayers remained an important institution that was not abolished after 60 years by Omar ibn Abd al-aziz
 madelang likhte hai: Umayyad excesses, corruption and repression were meant to gradually transform the minority of Ali's fans into a majority
 baad kii pidiyon kii yaad main ali vafaadaar ke adarsh commander ban gaye
 According to the fake Umayyad Islam claims legitimate sovereignty in Islam as a sub-rule of God, and in the context of Umayyad betrayal, arbitrary and divisive government and vindictive vengeance, they came to appreciate his honesty, his unbearable devotion
 The rule of Islam, his deep personal loyalty, the equal treatment of all his supporters, and his generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies
 afghanistan ke majaari sharif main roj-e-shareef, blue masjid - jahaan musalamaanon kii alpsankhyak maanati he ki ali ebn abu talib ko dafnaaya gaya he
 According to al-sheikh al-mufid, Ali did not want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies and consequently he asked his friends and family to bury him quietly
 is gupt kabristaan ko uske vanshaj or chathe shiya imam imam jafar al-sadik dwaara abbasid khaliphot ke dauraan baad main pataa chalaa tha
 Most Shi'ites accept that Ali is buried at the tomb of Imam Ali in the Imam Ali Mosque which is now the city of Najaf, which grew around the mosque and temple called Masjid Ali
 haalanki, kuch afgaanon dwaara aamtaur par banaae rakhaa gaya ek or kahani, note karti he ki prasiddh sharir blue masjid yaa roj-e-shareef main afgaan shahar majaar-e-shareef main unke sharir ko le jaaya gaya tha or dafnaaya gaya tha
 Ali is respected not only as a warrior and leader, but as a writer and religious authority
 dharamshastra or exegesis se sulekh or ank vigyaan se vishyon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa, kanoon or rahasyavaad se arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti se ali dwaara pehali baar mana jaataa he
 According to a hadith described by the Shia and Sufis, Muhammad told of them, "I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate 


" Muslims consider Ali a major authority in Islam
 shiya ke mutabik, ali ne khud hi yah gavaahi di: There was not a single verse of the Quran but was revealed, which he did not proceed to direct me and read to me
 main ise apane haath se likhuunga, or vah mujhe apane tafaseer or tavil, nasikh ke rup main nirdeshit karegaa or manasmukh, muhakkam or matashabih, vishesh or saamaanya 


 According to Seyed Hossein Nasser, Ali is credited with establishing Islamic theology and his citations include the first rational evidence of the unity of God among Muslims
 ebn abi al-hadeed ne uddhrut kiya he For the sake of doctrine and dealing with matters of divinity, it was not an Arab art
 is tarah ke kuch bhi unke vishisht aankadon yaa nichle rankon main se kuch ke bich prasaarit nahin kiya gaya tha
 The art was the exclusive preserve of Greece, whose sage was the only extender
 arabon ke bich sauda karne vaala pehla vyakti ali tha
 In later Islamic philosophies, especially in the teachings of Mulla Sadra and his followers, like Alemeh Tabatatei, Ali's stories and sermons were increasingly regarded as central sources of spiritual knowledge, or divine philosophy
 sadara ke skool ke sadsy ali ko islam ke sarvocch aadhyatmik chikitsak maanate hai
 According to Henry Corbin, Nahj al-balagha can be regarded as one of the most important sources of doctrines made by Shiite thinkers, especially after 1500
 iskaa prabhaav shabdon ke taarkik samanvay, katautee main mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he sahi nishkarshon ke, or arabi main kuch takneekee sharton kaa nirmaan jo saahitiyik or darshanik bhashaa main swatantra rup se unani granthon ke arabi main anuwaad ke pravesh main pravesh kiya
 In addition, some hidden or occult sciences such as Jafar, Islamic numerology, and the science of the symbolic significance of the letters of the Arabic alphabet, have been established by Ali, through which he al-jafar and al-jamia
 ali arabi sahitya kaa ek mahaan vidwaan bhi tha or arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti ke kshetra main agrani tha
 Many of Ali's short stories have become part of the general Islamic culture and are cited in daily life as excitement and stories
 ve saahitiyik kaaryon kaa aadhaar bhi ban gaye hai yaa kai bhashaaon main kavy kavita main ekikrut kiye gaye hai
 In the 8th century, literary authorities such as' Abd al-hamid ibn Yahya al-amiri pointed to Ali's unique pronunciation of sermons and stories, as did al-jahiz in the following century
 umayyaad ke divaan ke karmchaariyon ne bhi apane vakprachaar ko sudhaarney ke liye ali ke upadeshon ko padhaa
 The most famous selection of Ali's words and writings is gathered by a 10th-century Shia scholar, al-sharif al-radi, in a book called Nahj al-balgha, who selected him for his singular rhetorical beauty
 pustak main uddhrut upadeshon ke bich note, andekha upadesh ke saath hi alef ke upadesh bhi he
 According to the legends, some of Muhammad's companions were discussing the role of letters in speaking
 unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki bolne main alef kaa sabase bada yogadan tha or bindidaar patr bhi mahatvapurn the
 Meanwhile, Ali read two long impromptu sermons, one according to shell writer Langroudy, without using the letter Aleph and the other without dotted letters, without deep and eloquent concepts
 ek isai lekhak jorge Jordac, ne kaha ki Aleph or dot ke bina upadesh saahitiyik kriti ke rup main mana janaa tha
 Ali is respected for his deep sympathy and support for the poor and orphans, and he pursued similar egalitarian policies during his caliphate with the aim of achieving social justice
 unhen yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he: If God grants wealth and prosperity to any person, then he should show kindness to his worthy kith and kin, provide for the poor, help those who are suffering from disasters, misfortune and the reverse, help the poor And honest people should help in ending their debt


 yah kitaab al- kaaphi main sunai gai he ki amir al-muminine ali ebn abi talib ko baghdad ke paas sthanon se shahad or anjir ke saath prastut kiya gaya tha
 Upon receiving the gift, he ordered his officers to bring the orphans so that they could lick the honey from the containers while he rested himself among the people
 nahaj al-balgha main ali ke liye jimmedaar bolne vaale upadesh, patr or uddhran shaamil hai jinhen raakh-sharif aar-radio dwaara sankalit kiya gaya he
 Reza Shah Kazemi states: "despite ongoing questions about the authenticity of the text, recent scholarship suggests that much of the material in it may actually be attributed to Ali" and in support of an article by Mokhtar Jebali Gives reference
 arabi sahitya main is pustak kii ek pramukh sthiti he
 It is also considered an important intellectual, political and religious work in Islam
 nahajul balagha ke urdu anuvadak saiyad jishaan haidar javaadee ne eech 204 se 488 tak 61 lekhakon or unke lekhakon kii suchi sankalit kii he, or un sroton ko pradaan kiya he jinamein sharif kaa sankalan kaary razi kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Masadir Nahj al-balagha wa Asanidah, written by al-sayyid ‘abd al-zahra’ al-husayn al-khatib, offers some of these sources
 iske alaava, mohammad baqir al- mahamudi dwaara nahaj al-saadah faai mastadra nahaj al-balaghah ali ke maujuuda bhaashanon, upadeshon, niyamon, patron, prarthanaaon or ekatrit hone vaale kahaniyon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he

 There are many commentaries from Sunnis and Shias such as Ibn Abi al-hadid's comments and Muhammad Abdudh's commentaries
 mukhya lekh: ali ebn abi talib or alvi ke vanshadli ne shuruyaat main fatima se shaadi kii, jo unki sabase pyaari patni thim

 aakhri kii maut sandigdh he
 Some historians have added the names of Ali's other sons, including Ibrahim, Umar and Abdallah ibn al-askar, who were killed in Karbala
 unki beti jainab-jo karbala main thim- yajid kii sena ne kabja kar liya tha or baad main hossain or uske anuyaayiyon ke saath kya hua, yah prakat karne main ek badi bhoomika nibhaai
 Ali's descendants are known as Sharifs, stories or stories by Fatima
 ye arabi main aadarneey khitaab hai, sharif kaa arth 'mahaan' he or kaha jaataa he yaa kaha jaataa he yaa 'bhagwaan' yaa 'sar' kahata he
 As the only descendants of Muhammad, he is respected by both Sunni and Shia
 mohammad ke alaava, islamic itihaas main koi bhi nahin he jiske bare main islamic bhashaaon main ali ke rup main likhaa gaya he
 In Muslim culture, Ali is respected for his courage, wisdom, faith, honesty, devotion to Islam, deep loyalty to Muhammad, equal treatment of all Muslims and generosity in forgiving defeated enemies, and therefore of mystical traditions The center is like Sufism in Islam
 ali kuranik exegesis, islamic nyaayashasre or dharmik vichaar par ek adhikaar ke rup main apane kad barkaraar rakhata he
 Ali holds a high position in almost all Sufi orders that trace his lineage to Muhammad through them
 puure islamic itihaas main ali kaa prabhaav mahatvapurn rahaa he
 Sunni and Shia scholars agree that the verse of Wilayah was recited in honor of Ali, but Wilayah and Imamate have different interpretations
 sunni vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki kavita ali ke bare main he, lekin unhen shiya muslim vichaar main, imam ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa jaataa he, ali ko bhagwaan dwaara mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main chunaa gaya tha
 There are several verses interpreted by Shia scholars referring to Ali or other Shia Imams
 is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue ki quran main imam ke naamon kaa ullekh kyon nahin kiya gaya he, mohammad al-baqir uttar dete hai: "allaah ne apane paigambar ko salaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin teen yaa chaar rakaton ke bare main kabhi nahin kaha, jakaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin iske vivaranon kaa zikr nahin kiya haj lekin iske tawaaf or paigambar kii ginati nahin hui thi 
 He revealed this verse and the Prophet said that this verse is about Ali, Hasan, Hussain and the twelve Imams
 " ali ke anusaar kuranik chhandon kii ek chauthai imam ke stesan ko bataa rahi he
 Mammen lists many of these verses in his introduction to Shia Islam
 haalanki, kuch chand hai ki kuch sunni tippaneekar ali ke sandarbh main vyakhya karte hai, jinamein se vilaah kii kavita he ki sunni or shiya vidwaan is ghatana ko sanderbhit karte hai ali ne apni anguthi ko ek bhikhaari ko diya jisane masjid main anushthan prarthana karte hue bhakton se poocha
 Mavadda's poem is one of the verses, both Sunni and Shiite associated Ali's name with some other names
 mubahaalaa kii uparokt kavita, or yah bhi pad 2: 26 9 jisamen ali ko shiya or sunni donon tippaneekaron dwaara adwitiya gyaan ke saath sammanit kiya jaataa he is tarah ke chand
 The Shia consider Ali the most important person after Muhammad and he represents a complex, mythological figure in his memory
 vah gunon kaa ek paragon he, jaise saahas, mahanata, eemaandaaree, sidhaapan, vakprachaar or gahan gyaan
 Ali was righteous but faced injustice, he was authoritative but kind and courteous, vigorous but also patient, learned but also a laboring man
 shiya ke anusaar, mohammad ne apane jeevankaal ke dauraan vibhinn avasaron par suzav diya ki unki mrityu ke baad ali musalamaanon kaa netaa hona chahie
 It is supported by many hadiths, narrated by Shams, including the Hadith of the pond of Khum, the Hadiths of two weighty things, the Hadiths of pen and paper, the Hadiths of the Cloak, the Hadiths of the post, the invitation of the Nimath close family, and the twelve successors The Hadith
 jafar al-sadik haddees main varnan karata he ki mohammad main jo bhi gun paaya gaya vah ali main paaya gaya tha, jo uske maargdarshan se dur hokar allaah or uske paigambar se dur ho jayega
 Ali himself describes that he is the gateway and overseer to reach Allah
 is drushtikon ke anusaar, mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main ali ne nyaay main samudaay par shashan nahin kiya, balki sharia kanoon or iske gudh arth kaa bhi arth diya 
 He was therefore considered free from error and sin, and ordained by God by divine decree through Muhammad
 yah twailvar or ismali shi islam main mana jaataa he ki 'ekl, divine gyaan, bhavishyavaktaaon or imaamon kii atmaaon kaa strot tha or unhen goom naamak gudh gyaan diya gaya tha or unke dukh unke bhakton ko divya krupa kaa saadhan the
 Although the Imam was not the recipient of a divine revelation, he had a close relationship with God through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides people
 unke shabdon or karm samudaay ke liye ek guide or model hai;natijatan yah sharia kanoon kaa strot he
 Shia pilgrims usually go to Mashad Ali in Najaf for Ziyarat, pray there and recite "ziyarat Amin Allah" or other Ziyaratnam

 gregory tithi is ke liye har saal badalata he: Main article: Sunni visions of Ali see Sunnis as the fourth caliph
 ali islam ke sabase mahaan yoddha champiyanon main se ek ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
