 Gurukuls were often run by Brahmin householders, both inside and outside the villages or towns
 grihasth vidwaan or kabhi kabhi wanprasthi bhi dur dur se shikshaarthiyon ko aakrisht karte or apane parivaar main or apane saath rakhkar anek varshon tak unhen shiksha dete

 Regardless of the superhuman put in this story of Raghuvansh, it is a complete reflection of the teaching-related gospel

 This tradition was often continued by most of the rulers and there are descriptions in many inscriptions of the Gurukuls running in the villages donated to the Brahmins of South India and the teachings taught in them

 That family could either be a small and undivided family or a large and many small families of similar origin

 Vande Mataram was second in the top 10 songs in the poll
 yadi bangla bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaay to iskaa sheershak "bande maataram" hona chaiye "vande maataram" nahin
 Since the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bengali script and since there is no other letter in Bengali script, it was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay under the title Bande Mataram
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sheershak 'bande maataram' hona chaiye tha
 But there is no meaning of 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and "vande Mataram" pronunciation means "I pray to Mother", so writing and reading Vande Mataram in Devanagari script would be expedient

 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song "vande Mataram", because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In view of these objections, in 1937, the Congress took a deep view on this dispute
 jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti jisamen moulana abul kalam aaazaad bhi shaamil the, ne paaya ki is geet ke shuruuaati do pad to mathrubhumi kii prashansa main kahe gayi hai, lekin baad ke padon main hindu devi-devataaon kaa zikr hone lagata he; isaliye yah nirnay liya gaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do padon ko hi raashtra-geet ke rup main prayukt kiya jaayegaa
 In this way, Jana Hee Jan-gana-man Adhinayak of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Thakur was allowed to remain as the national anthem and Mohammad Iqbal's Qaumi Tarane Saare Jahan Se Achcha with the initial two-song song Vande Mataram national song composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was approved
 swatantrata prapti ke baad dow rajendra prasad ne samvidhan sabha main 24 janvari 1950 main 'vande maataram' ko raashtragit ke rup main apnaane sambandhi vaktavy padhaa jise sweekaar kar liya gaya
 The statement made by Dr
 Rajendra Prasad to the Constituent Assembly is as follows: anand math upanyaas ko lekar bhi kuch vivaad hai, kuch kattar log ise muslim virdohi maanate hai
 He says that in this, Muslims have been described as foreign and traitorous
 vande maataram gane par bhi vivaad kiya ja rahaa he
 The first two stops of this song, which are relevant, do not contain any anti-muslim talk and do not worship any goddess or Durga
 par in logon kaa kahana he ki- However, it is not the case that all Muslims of India object to this or that all Hindus insist on singing it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kuch saal pehle vikhyath sangeetkaar e0 aar0 rahamaan ne, jo khud ek musalmaan hai, vande maataram ko lekar ek sangeet elbum taiyaar kiya tha jo bahut lokapriy hua
 Most people believe that this dispute is political
 kya kisi ko koi geet gane ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he athwa nahin? yah prashn sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh bijoy emmanuele varses kerala rajya naam ke ek vaad main uthaaya gaya
 In this suit, some students were expelled from school because they refused to sing the national anthem Jana Gana Mana
 yah vidhyaarthee skool main raashtragan ke samay iske sammaan main khadey hote the tathaa iskaa sammaan karte the par geet ko gaate nahin the
 He refused to sing
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne unki yachika sweekaar kar lee or skool ko unhen waapas lene ko kaha
 The Supreme Court said that if a person honors the national anthem but does not sing it, it does not mean that he is insulting it
 at: ise na gane ke liye us vyakti ko dandit yaa pratadit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since Vande Mataram is the national anthem of this country, the same law and rules will apply even if it is forced to sing forcefully

 Vampires are fictitious beings who survive by eating the life-essence of living beings, usually by drinking their blood
 Although uniquely described as dead but supernaturally living creatures, some obsolete traditions believed vampires to be living people

 europe main pishaach andh-vishwaas ke bade hue str se jan unmaad utpann hua or kuch maamalon main shavon ko daanv par laga diya gaya tathaa logon par pashachiki kaa aarope lagaaya jane laga
 Vampires nowadays are generally perceived as fictitious entities, although in some cultures people's belief in related creatures such as the 'chupacabra' still prevails

 The English word is derived from the German word vampir
 yah srbija ke вампир / vampir shabd se 18veen sadi ke aarambh main liya gaya
 This form of Serbia is virtually parallel to all Slavic languages: вампир in Bulgaria, upír in Czech and Slovak, wąpierz and upiór in Polish, упырь in Russia, упырь in Belarus, упирь in Ukraine, originating from упирь in Old Russia
 
 It is common belief that the first written evidence of the Old Russian Упирь format is found in a document dated 6555
 yah ek padri dwaara likhi gai bhakthi-geeton kii pustak kii pandulipi main paaya jane vaala ek pratik colofan he jisane novgordian rajkumaar vladimir yeroslavovich ke liye is pustak ko glagolytic se sirilik main lipyantarit kiya

 An apparently unique example of this name is cited as using current idolatry and surnames as personal names

 The notion of vampirism has existed for centuries; As in the stories of Mesopotamia, Hebrew, Ancient Greek and Roman cultures, demons and spirits were considered to be the vanguard of modern vampires
 Although the emergence of vampire-like creatures in these ancient civilizations, folklore has its power based on today
 We know that vampires originated exclusively in southeast Europe in the 18th century, when the inhabitants of that region Oral traditions of other groups have been documented and published
 adhiktar maamalon main pishaachon ko bure praaniyon, aatmahatya ke shikaar yaa chudilon ke bhoot-pret ke rup main mana gaya lekin itnaa srijan apkaaree pretatmaon ke dwaara bhi sambhav he jinke kabje main koi laash he yaa jinhen kisi pishaach ne kaat liya he
 Belief in such folklore became so widespread that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and public executions of people considered vampires were also done
 lokkthatmak pishaach kaa ek nishchit vivaran dena kathin he, haalanki europea lokkathaon main aise anek tatv hai jo sarv saamaanya hai

 In Russian folklore, vampires were once witches or people who revolted against the church while alive

 The practice of burying bodies upside down was also prevalent

 This method is similar to the ancient Greek practice in which a coin was placed in the mouth of the corpse to pay for the passage to cross the Stix River flowing in the Hades
 yah tark diya gaya he ki bajaay iske, dusht aatma ko sharir main pravesh karne se rokane ke liye hi sikke rakh die jate the
 Perhaps this practice later influenced the folk tales of vampires
 vrukolakas ke sambandh main yah parampara aadhunik unani lokkathaon main jari rahi, jisamen sharir ko pishaach banane se rokane ke liye mom ke cross or "jisas christ conkars" khude hue mitti ke bartan murde ke sharir par rakh die jate the taaki vah pishaach na ban jaay

 Similar Chinese descriptions show that if a vampire-like creature had passed through a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain before entering it
 This mythical theme is found in fictional stories from the Indian subcontinent as well as tales of witches and other similar evil spirits or creatures from South America

 Several fundamental theories of the vampire origin beliefs have been introduced as an explanation of superstition and sometimes as mass hysteria caused by vampires

 However, in many cultures, there is a superstition about ghosts similar to Eastern European vampires, which is a prevalent cultural concept of Slavic vampires
 slav samskruti main pishaach main vishwaas kii jaden kaaphi had tak isaikaran se purv slav logon kii aadhyatmik manyataayen evam rivaaz or mrityu ke pashchaat jivan ke bare main unki samaj par aadhaarit he
 Despite the lack of pre-christian Slavic writings describing the old religion, many pagan non-christian pagan beliefs and religious rituals continued even after the Slavic people had Christianized their country
 aisi manyataon or rivaazon ke udaahranon main purvajon kii puja, ghar kii atmaaon evam mrityu ke baad aatma ke bare main vishwaas shaamil hai
 The roots of belief in vampires in Slavic regions can be traced to the complex structure of Slavic spirituality
 shaitan or pretatmaon ne prak-audyogic slav samaaj main mahatvapurn kaary kiye or unhen manushya ke jivan tathaa unke adhikaar-kshetra main parsparik rup se prabhavit karne vaala samajha jaataa tha
 Some spirits were benevolent and helpful in human actions, while other spirits were harmful and often destructive
 aisi pretatmaon ke udhaaharan domovoi, rusalka, vila, kickemora, poludnitsa or vodyanoy hai
 These spirits were also thought to be derived from ancestors or some dead human
 aisi pretatmaayen icchaanusaar vibhinn aakaaron main prakat ho sakati thim, yahaan tak ki bhinn pashuon or maanav aakaaron main
 inamen se kuch pretatmaayen maanvon ko haani pahunchane ke liye apkaaree kaary kalapon main shaamil ho sakati thim, jaisaa ki, maanvon ko duubone main, fasal kii paidaavaar main baadha pahunchane main yaa maweshiyon ke khun chusane main or kabhi-kabhi maanvon ko sidhe haani pahunchane main bhi

 Ordinary Slavic belief points to a fundamental difference between soul and body
 aatma ko nashwar nahin mana jaataa he
 The Slavs believed that after death, the soul would go out of the body and would go on touring its neighborhood and work place for 40 days before moving to infinity
 For this reason, it was considered necessary to leave the doors and windows of the house open so that the soul could move freely at its leisure
 logon ko aisa vishwaas tha ki is vakt aatma main mritak ke shav main punah pravesh karne kii kshamta he
 Like the spirits mentioned earlier, the departed soul will either bless or wreak havoc on its family and neighbors during these 40 days of arrival
 kisi ek vyakti kii mrityu par uski aatma kii pavitrataa or shanti sunishchit karne ke liye uchit antyeshti sanskaar par adhik jor diya jaataa tha kyonki yah aatma uske sharir se alag ho chuki thi
 These could have been the basic reasons for the soul to remain impure after the death of a baptized child, violent or premature death, or the death of a terrible sinner
 agar sharir ko uchit dhang se dafnaaya nahin gaya to bhi aatma ashuddh ho sakati he
 Alternatively, if a body is not buried properly, there may be a strong possibility of any other unclean spirits and spirits entering it
 ek ashuddh aatma slav logon main se isiilie itani bhaybheet rahati thi kyonki unamem pratishodh lene kii kshamta thi
 These deeply entrenched beliefs concerning death and soul contributed to the invention of the Slavic concept of vampire

 This undead creature is considered vindictive and jealous of the living
 ise apana shaareerik astitv banaae rakhane ke liye jiviton ke rakt kii hameshaa jarurat bani rahati he
 Although this concept of vampire is in a slightly different form in Slavic countries and their non-slavic neighbors - it is possible to trace the development of the vampire faith to pre-christian Slavic spiritualism in Slavic regions
 paul barbar ne apni pustak vaimpyres, barial and deth main yah varnan kiya he ki pishaachon main vishwaas is baat kaa parinaam tha ki prak-audyogic samaaj ke logon ke liye mrityu or sadan kii prakritik prakriya varnan se baahar thi
 People were sometimes skeptical about vampirism when a corpse did not look like a natural corpse without burial as they thought

 laashen phoolati hai kyonki sadan se dhad main gaisen bharti hai or badhata hua dabaav rakt ko munh or naak se risne ke liye baadhya kar detaa he

 duusare maamalon main log unke siron, naakon yaa chehron par maarthe the or yah jaahir hota tha ki ve "bhojan kara" rahe hai
 The problem with this theory is the question of how those who were supposedly buried alive, how could they survive without food, water or pure air for so long

 This theory was rejected from the point of view of medical science

 The sexual aspect may or may not remain intact

 Modi is a surname in India
 yah saamanytah uttar or pashchim bhartiya rajya haryana, madhya pradesh, rajasthan, bihar, jharkhand or gujarat main paaya jaataa hai
 Modi is mostly related to the Baniya caste
 ‘modi’ kaa saamaanya arth he, daal, chaaval aadi bechney vaala, pansaari, parchuniya, grosar
 bhandari yaa store-keeper ko bhi modi kah sakate hai
 And 'modikhana' means Modi's shop or store, grocer's shop, general store, ration shop, grocery store, logistics store, supply store
 Narendra Modi hails from modh-ghanchi society of Gujarat which has traditionally been extracting and selling vegetable oil
 yah ek aitihaasik tathy he ki bharat main peedi-dar-peedi ek hi vyavsaay main lage rahane ke kaaran paariwarik vyavsaay hi jatiyon main badal gaye the
 The nomenclature of the Modi caste seems to have started with the business of selling moths in ancient times
 lagbhag 10,000 varsh pehle kii duniya main, jab hamaare bhil-shikari-ghumantu purakhe wanon ko chhod kar maanav sabhyataa ke pehle gaanv basaanaa chaah rahe tha
 Our ancestors wanted to do agriculture, leaving the collection of tubers and fruits and hunting, but they still liked to eat only the things that had grown in the forest
 aise main kuch log van se van-upaj laa kar gaanv ke logon ko bechate the yaa unka len-dein karte tha
 Only those who sell or deal with forest produce will be called foresters / foresters / bunnies
 in varnaakon main bhi vibhinn log van se vastu-vishesh laane main visheshgyata rakhane lage honge
 Due to specialization in this particular item, the sub-castes of the Baniya caste would have been formed, such as Bamboo with Bansal / Bansal, Madhu with Madhukul / Mudgal
 van se laakar moth bechney vaale yaa uskaa lenden karne vaale vinaye mothi kehalaae honge or phir mothi se modhi or modi
 In ancient times, when our ancestors were identifying and naming new foods, they may have named the tuber-root-fruit-grain on their taste, size or other properties
 jaise madhur > matur > matar
 When the Moth plant was discovered in this sequence, the forefathers found that this sweet pod is liked by humans and animals too
 mithaas ke kaaran iskaa naam hua - mishth > moshth > moshthak > mukusht > moshthak > mothike > modike 
 moshth > moth > mut / math 
 Moth can be eaten without cooking as it becomes soft and sprouts shortly after being soaked in water
 at: yah bhartiya mul kaa paudha maanav itihaas main sabase pehle upyog main laaye jane vaale ann / daal main se ek rahaa hoga
 This is why Moth was named Moth
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki modi shabd modak se bana, at: modi halwai the
 But it seems that Mokshaka or Moth would have been used to make the first modak of the world
 at: moth se modak
 yah kalpana moth ke is gun par aadhaarit he ki ise bina pakaaye kha sakate hai
 By mixing some sweet juice in raw soaked moth, it would have become the first modak of the world
 aaj moth ke to nahin kintu mung, urad or chane ke modak kaaphi lokapriy hai
 So Modi from Moth, Modak from Moth; Modi is not Modak
 sabhi jatiyon main keval baniye yaa modi hi apana len-dein kaa hisaab bahi-khaaton main rakhte the, in bahiyon main anya modiyon se lenden kaa hisaab vibhinn kollam main likhaa jaataa tha
 Each Modi had a separate column
 yaheen se talika ke kollam ko mad yaa madd kaha jane laga hoga

 landow-ramanujan sthirankaramanujan-sholdener sthirankaramanujan theta falnarogers-ramanujan tatsamakaramanujan abhajyakrutrim theta falanbus Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyengar was a great Indian mathematician
 inhen aadhunik kaal ke mahanatam ganit vichaarkon main gina jaataa he
 He did not get any special training in mathematics, yet he made deep contributions in the areas of analysis and number theory
 inhone apane pratibha or lagan se na keval ganit ke kshetra main adbhut avishkaar kiye varan bharat ko athulaneey gaurav bhi pradaan kiya
 He was a brilliant genius since childhood
 inhone khud se ganit siikhaa or apane jeevanabhar main ganit ke 3,884 pramayon kaa sankalan kiya
 Most of these theorems have been proved correct
 inhone ganit ke sahaj gyaan or bijganit prakalan kii adwitiya pratibha ke bal par bahut se moulik or aparmparik parinaam nikaale jinase prerit shodh aaj tak ho rahaa he, yadhyapi inaki kuch khojon ko ganit mukhyadhara main ab tak nahin apanaaya gaya he
 Recently their formulas have been used in crystal science
 inke kaary se prabhavit ganit ke kshetron main ho rahe kaam ke liye ramanujan jarnal kii sthapana kii gai he
 Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 in the village of Erode, Coimbatore, in the southern part of India
 vah paaramparik brahman parivaar main janme the
 His mother's name was Komaltammal and his father's name was Srinivasa Iyengar
 inkaa bachapan mukhyatah kumbhakonam main beetaa tha jo ki apane pracheen mandiron ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Ramanujan's intellectual development in childhood was not like that of ordinary children
 yah teen varsh kii aayu tak bolnaa bhi nahin sikh paae the
 When Ramanujan did not start speaking till such a great age, everyone was worried that he would be dumb
 baad ke varshon main jab unhone vidhyalay main pravesh liya to bhi paaramparik shiksha main inkaa kabhi bhi man nahin laga
 Ramanujan attained the highest marks in the entire district in the primary examination at the age of ten and reached the town high school for further education
 ramanujan ko prashn poochna bahut pasand tha
 His questions sometimes seemed very strange to the teachers
 jaise ki-sansar main pehla purush koun tha? prithvi or badalon ke bich kii duuri kitni hoti he? ramanujan kaa vyavhaar bada hi madhur tha
 His somewhat more gross body and glowing eyes of curiosity gave him a different identity
 inke sahpaathiyon ke anusaar inkaa vyavhaar itnaa saumy tha ki koi inase naaraaz ho hi nahin saktaa tha
 His talent in the school started making a mark on other students and teachers
 inhone skool ke samay main hi kalege ke str ke ganit ko pard liya tha
 Once the headmaster of his school had also said that the criteria for examinations to be held in the school does not apply to Ramanujan
 hiskool kii pariksha uteern karne ke baad inhen ganit or angreji me achche ank laane ke kaaran subramanyam chaatravrutti mili or aage kalege kii shiksha ke liye pravesh bhi mila
 a further problem occurred
 ramanujan kaa ganit ke prati prem itnaa bad gaya tha ki ve duusare vishyon par dhyaan hi nahin dete the
 He used to solve mathematics questions even in history, biology classes
 nateeja yah hua ki gyarahavin kaksha kii pariksha main ve ganit ko chhod kar baaki sabhi vishyon main fail ho gaye or parinamswaroop unako chaatravrutti milani band ho gai
 One, the financial condition of the house was poor and scholarship was not being received from above
 ramanujan ke liye yah bada hi kathin samay tha
 He also did some maths tuition and ledger work to improve the condition of the house
 kuch samay baad 1907 main ramanujan ne phir se barahavin kaksha kii privet pariksha di or anuteern ho gaye
 And with this, their traditional education was celebrated
 vidhyalay chhodane ke baad kaa paanch varshon kaa samay inke liye bahut hataasha bharaa tha
 At this time India was caught in the shackles of subordination
 chaaron taraf bhayankar garibi thi
 At such a time, Ramanujan had neither a job nor an opportunity to work with any institute or professor
 bas unka ishwar par atoot vishwaas or ganit ke prati agaadh shraddha ne unhen kartavya maarg par chalane ke liye sadaiv prerit kiya
 Namgiri Devi was the Ishta Devi of Ramanujan's family
 unke prati atoot vishwaas ne unhen kahin rukne nahin diya or ve itani vipareet paristhitiyon main bhi ganit ke apane shodh ko chalaate rahe
 At this time Ramanujan used to get a total of five rupees monthly from tuition and lived in it
 ramanujan kaa yah jivan kaal bahut ksht or dukh se bharaa tha
 He always had to wander around to maintain his education and continue his education and had to plead unsuccessfully to many people
 varsh 1908 main inke mata pita ne inkaa vivaah janaki naamak kanya se kar diya
 After marriage, it was no longer possible for them to forget everything and drown in mathematics
 atah ve naukari kii talash main madras aae
 He did not get a job due to not passing the XII examination and his health also fell badly
 ab doctor kii salaah par inhen waapas apane ghar kumbhakonam lautnaa padaa
 After recovering from illness, he came back to Madras and started looking for a job again
 ye jab bhi kisi se milte the to use apana ek register dikhaate the
 This register contained all the work done by him in mathematics
 isi samay kisi ke kehane par ramanujan vahaan ke dipti colector shri ve
 ramasvami ayyar se mili
 Iyer was a great scholar of mathematics
 yahaan par shri ayyar ne ramanujan kii pratibha ko pahachaanaa or jiladhikari shri ramchandra raav se kah kar inke liye 25 rupaye masik chaatravrutti kaa prabandh bhi kar diya
 On this instinct, Ramanujan published his first research paper in Madras for a year
 shodh patr kaa sheershak tha "barnauli sankhyaon ke kuch gun” or yah shodh patr jarnal of indian mathematical socity main prakashit hua tha
 After completing one year here, he worked as a clerk in Madras Port Trust
 saubhaahgya se is naukari main kaam kaa boj kuch zyada nahin tha or yahaan inhen apane ganit ke liye paryaapt samay miltaa tha
 Here Ramanujan used to stay awake all night and write new mathematical formulas and then take a rest for a while and then leave for office
 ramanujan ganit ke shodhon ko slate par likhte the
 And later wrote it down in a register
 raat ko ramanujan ke slate or khadie kii aawaaj ke kaaran parivaar ke anya sadasyon kii neend chaupat ho jaati thi
 At this time there was a great distance between Indian and Western living and due to this Indians were generally very hesitant to present their things to the British scientists
 idhar sthiti kuch aisi thi ki bina kisi angrej ganitagya kii sahaayta liye shodh kaary ko aage nahin badhaayaa ja saktaa tha
 At this time Ramanujan's old well wishers came to his work and these people sent the work done by Ramanujan to the famous mathematicians of London
 par yahaan inhen kuch vishesh sahaayta nahin mili lekin ek laabh yah hua ki log ramanujan ko thodaa bahut jaanane lage the
 At the same time, Ramanujan showed some formulas of his number theory to Professor Seshu Iyer, then he turned his attention to Professor Hardy of London
 professor hardi us samay ke vishwa ke prasiddh ganitagyon main se ek the
 And was known for his strict nature and discipline
 professor hardi ke shodhakarya ko padhane ke baad ramanujan ne bataaya ki unhone professor hardi ke anuttarit prashn kaa uttar khoj nikaala he
 Now Ramanujan's correspondence with Professor Hardy began
 ab yahaan se ramanujan ke jivan main ek nae yug kaa sutarapaat hua jisamen professor hardi kii bahut badi bhoomika thi
 In other words, the way a jeweler identifies a diamond and shines it, Professor Hardy has some similar place in Ramanujan's life
 professor hardi aaajeevan ramanujan kii pratibha or jivan darshan ke prashansak rahe
 This friendship of Ramanujan and Professor Hardy proved beneficial for both
 ek tarah se dekha jaae to dono ne ek duusare ke liye poorak kaa kaam kiya
 Professor Hardy valued various talented people of that time on a scale of 100
 adhikansh ganitagyon ko unhone 100 main 35 ank die or kuch vishisht vyaktiyon ko 60 ank die
 But he gave Ramanujan a full 100 in 100 points
 aarambh main ramanujan ne jab apane kiye gaye shodhakarya ko professor hardi ke paas bheja to pehle unhen bhi puraa samaj main nahin aayaa
 When he consulted his friend mathematicians, he came to the conclusion that Ramanujan is a rare personality in the field of mathematics and that he should come to England to understand the work done by him and to further research in it
 atah unhone ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye aamantrit kiya
 For some personal reasons and lack of funds, Ramanujan declined Professor Hardy's invitation to Cambridge
 professor hardi ko isse niraashaa hui lekin unhonen kisi bhi tarah se ramanujan ko vahaan bulaane kaa nishchay kiya
 At the same time, Ramanujan got a research career at the University of Madras, which made his life a bit easier and he was also getting full time for research work
 isi bich ek lambey patravyavhaar ke baad dhire-dhire professor hardi ne ramanujan ko cambridge aane ke liye sahamat kar liya
 Ramanujan was also funded by Professor Hardy's efforts to go to Cambridge
 ramanujan ne england jane ke pehle ganit ke kareeb 3000 se bhi adhik naye sutron ko apni notebook main likhaa tha
 Ramanujan stepped on the land of London
 vahaan professor hardi ne unke liye pehle se vvavastha kii hui thi atah inhen koi vishesh pareshaani nahin hui
 Ramanujan had little trouble in England and the reason for this was his shy, calm nature and pure satvic lifestyle
 apane puure england pravaas main ve adhikanshtah apana bhojan swayan banaate the
 This journey of England brought a revolutionary change in his life
 unhone professor hardi ke saath mil kar ucchkoti ke shodhpatr prakashit kiye
 Due to his special research he was awarded BA by Cambridge University
 Also got the title of
 lekin vahaan kii jalwaayu or rahan-sahan kii style unke adhik anukool nahin thi or unka swasthya kharaab rahane laga
 The doctors called it tuberculosis
 us samay kshay rog kii koi dawa nahin hoti thi or rogi ko senetorium me rahanaa padataa tha
 Ramanujan also had to stay there for a few days
 vahaan is samay bhi yah ganit ke sutron main nai nai kalpanaaen kiya karte the
 After this, Ramanujan was named a Fellow of the Royal Society
 aise samay main jab bharat gulaami main ji rahaa tha tab ek ashwet vyakti ko royal socity kii sadsyta milanaa ek bahut badi baat thi
 In the entire history of the Royal Society, there has been no member younger than them till date
 puure bharat main unke shubhachintakon ne utsav manaaya or sabhaayen kii
 After membership of the Royal Society, he also became the first Indian to get the fellowship of Trinity College
 ab aisa lag rahaa tha ki sab kuch bahut acchhee jagah par ja rahaa he
 But Ramanujan's health was deteriorating and eventually he had to return to India on the advice of doctors
 bharat aane par inhen madras vishvavidhyalay main praadhyaapak kii naukari mil gai
 And Ramanujan was rekindled in teaching and research
 bharat lautne par bhi swasthya ne inkaa saath nahin diya or haalat gambhir hoti ja rahi thi
 In the case of this disease also, he wrote a high level research paper on mock theta function
 ramanujan dwaara pratipaadit is falan kaa upyog ganit hi nahin balki chikitsavigyaan main cancer ko samajhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 His declining health became a matter of concern for all and even now doctors have given him the answer
 ant main ramanujan ke vidaa kii ghadi aa hi gai
 In the morning of 26 April 1920, he became unconscious and by midday he gave up his life
 is samay ramanujan kii aayu maatr 33 varsh thi
 His untimely demise was an irreparable loss to the mathematics world
 puure desh videsh main jisane bhi ramanujan kii mrityu kaa samachar suna vahiin stabdh ho gaya
 Ramanujan and most of the work done by him still remains an enigma for scientists
 ek bahut hi saamaanya parivaar main janm le kar puure vishwa ko aashcharyachakit karne kii apni is yatra main inhone bharat ko apurv gaurav pradaan kiya
 His old register on which he used to write his theorems and formulas was suddenly found in the library of Trinity College in 1976
 kareeb ek sau pannon kaa yah register aaj bhi vaigyanikon ke liye ek paheli bana hua he
 This register was later known as Ramanujan's note book
 mumbai ke tata moolbhoot anusandhan santhaan dwaara iskaa prakaashan bhi kiya gaya he
 Like Ramanujan's researches, his style of working in mathematics was also bizarre
 ve kabhi kabhi aadhi raat ko sote se jaag kar slate par ganit se sutara likhane lagate the or phir so jate the
 In this way it seemed that they were solving mathematics questions even in their dreams
 ramanujan ke naam ke saath hi unki kuladevi kaa bhi naam liya jaataa he
 He always kept in mind zero and infinite and used the mathematical formulas to explain its interrelationships
 ramanujan ke kaary karne kii ek visheshta thi
 Earlier, he used to write a new formula or theorem of mathematics but did not pay much attention to its origin
 iske bare main puche jane par ve kehete the ki yah sutara unhen namgiri devi kii krupa se praapt hue hai
 Ramanujan's faith in spirituality was so deep that he considered any work done in the field of mathematics as a part of spirituality
 ve dharm or aadhyatm main keval vishwaas hi nahin rakhte the balki use taarkik rup se prastut bhi karte the
 He used to say that "for me that mathematics formula does not mean that i do not get spiritual thoughts
" ” Ramanujan worked mainly in the field of number theory in England for five years
 ramanujan ne nimnlikhit sutara pratipaadit kiya- The specialty of this formula is that it expresses the relation of the two most famous constants of mathematics through an infinite continuous fraction
 pai ke liye unhone ek doosraa sutara bhi diya tha- 'ramanujan number' is a natural number that can be represented in two different ways by the sum of cubes of two numbers
 udhaaharan - 9 3 + 10 3 = 1 3 + 12 3 = 1729 { \ displaystyle 9^{3}+10^{3}=1^{3}+12^{3}=1729}
