 2) Alcohol: The second biggest cause of accidents is driving drunk and driving, most of the drivers in our country drive alcohol drunk, the main reason is their twenty four hours duty, they believe that if we get drunk So we will not get sleep which is totally wrong, after intoxication their body remains awake, but after getting intoxicated the person's mind automatically shows up and then the accident In this too, the government has made a very good rule, a provision has been made to punish the person who drinks alcohol or drunk, but this punishment is not available to most of the people
 If you take something or go away, then the negligence of the government came out here

 4) Flexible law system: - Even though the constitution of our country is the largest and ideal constitution in the world in writing, in reality it is very flexible or otherwise, there are shabby laws, everyone here knows that if our If you have a license and are insured for a vehicle, then let anyone hit you, even if it is not the President of India, it will not matter
 Within 7 days you will get bail and then keep fighting
 If the insurance company will pay for the lifetime and the rest of the damage, then no matter to the driver or the motor owner, they live comfortably due to accidents and their life goes on just as they do every day
 If it is the party that is harmed, Apart from this, our other party is not said to be responsible in this whole case, because after the accident, they take the money in a lot of cases as penalty and later they say that they had to go
 So gone, what else can you do? You are getting less and less money
 That is fine, and finally, whoever made a mistake, gets acquitted, becomes free and lives on the road again

 The Gregorian calendar {gregorian calendar} is a calendar used almost everywhere in the world
 yah julian kaaldarshak kaa roopaantaran he
 It was implemented by Pope Gregory
 isse pehle julian kaaldarshak prachlan main tha, lekin usamen anek trutiyaan thim, jinhen gregory kaaldarshak main dur kar diya gaya
 The main unit of Gregorian calendar is day
 365 dinon kaa ek varsh hota he, kintu har chauthaa varsh 366 din kaa hota he jise adhivarsh kehete hai
 The Sun-based almanac is repeated every 146,097 days
 ise 400 varshon main baanta gaya he or yah 20871 saptaah ke baraabar hota he
 In these 400 years, 303 years are common years, consisting of 365 days
 or 97 lip varsh hote hai, jiname 366 din hote hai
 Thus every year has 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds
 julian calendar main 365 din 6 ghante kaa varsh mana jaataa tha, parantu aisa maanane se prayek varsh kranti-paatik saura varsh se 11 minute 14 second adhik lete hai
 This excess exceeds 3 days in 400 years
 is bhul par sarvapratham rome ke pope gregory ne sookshmtapurvak vichaar kiya
 He calculated in 1582 AD that at the time of the Dharma Sammelan of Nice city, which took place in the year 325 AD, the aforesaid excess has become 10 days, due to which the date was going back 10 days due to not being taken into account
 
 is vichaar se unhone nepulas ke jyotishi elaay sius liliyas ke paraamarsh se 1582 isvi main 5 oktober ko 15 veen oktober nishchit kiya or tab se yah niyam nikaala ki jo shatabdi varsh 4 se puri tarah vibhajit hone kii bajaay yadi 400 se puri tarah vibhajit ho tabhi use adhivarsh mana jaae anyathaa nahin
 Since this new method was started by Pope Gregory, it was called the Gregorian method or the new method
 is paddati ko bhinn-bhinn isai deshon main bhinn-bhinn varshon main sweekaar kiya gaya
 From this it is necessary to keep this in mind while reading the history of these countries
 is naveen paddati ko italy, france, spain or portugal ne 1582 i0 main, prashia, germany ke roman catholic pradesh switzraland, holland or flanders ne 1583 i0 main, poland ne 1586 i0 main, hungary ne 1587 i0 main, germany or netherland ke protestant pradesh tathaa denmark ne 1700 i0 main, british samrajya ne 1752 i0 main, japan ne 1972 i0 main china ne 1912 i0 main, bulgaria ne 1915 i0 main, turki or soviet rus ne 1917 i0 main tathaa yugoslavia or romania ne 1919 i0 main apanaaya
 After 1582 AD, in 1700 AD till 28 February, the date of the new calendar increased from the old calendar by 10 days
 1600 i0 shatabdi varsh hone se chunki 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hota tha atah vah nayi paddati se bhi adhivarsh hi hota
 Therefore, it did not increase by 1 day to differentiate the date
 taatpary yah ki puraane calendar se naye calendar main taarikh badalte hue unheen shatabdi varshon main purvokt 10 din se ek-ek din kramshah badhaayaa jayega jin shatabdi varshon main 400 se puri tarah bhaag nahin lagata
 That is, after 28 February of 1700 AD, 11 days will be added instead of 10 days to make the date of the new calendar
 isi prakaar 1800 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 12 din or 1900 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 13 din jode jaayenge
 Again, this increase will be only 13 days due to being completely divided from 400 to 2000 AD, it will not increase by an additional 1 day
 gyarahavin putali trilochani jo katha kahi vah is prakaar he- raja vikramaditya bahut bade prajapalak the
 He always used to worry about the happiness and prosperity of his subjects
 ek baar unhone ek mahayajna karne kii thaanee
 Invited innumerable kings and emperors, priests and sages
 yahan tak ki devataaon ko bhi unhone nahin choda
 He made up his mind to invite the wind god himself and entrusted the task of inviting the sea god to a qualified Brahmin
 donon apane kaam se vidaa hue
 When Vikram reached the forest, he began to decide so that the whereabouts of Pawan Dev would be known
 yoga-sadhana se pataa chalaa ki pawan dev aajkal sumeru parvat par vaas karte hai
 They thought that if the deity of the wind was invoked on the Sumeru mountain, they could have darshan
 unhone donon betaalon kaa samaran kiya to ve upasthit ho gaye
 He told them his purpose
 betaalon ne unhen aanan-fanan main sumeru parvat kii chotii par pahunchaa diya
 The peak was so strong that it was difficult to set foot
 bade-bade vriksh or chattan apni jagah se udakar dur chale ja rahe the
 But even Vikram was not deterred
 ve yoga-sadhana main siddhhast the, isliye ek jagah achal hokar baith gaye
 Forgetting the outside world, Pawan got engaged in the spiritual practice of Dev
 na kuch khaanaa, na pinaa, sona or aaraam karnaa bhuulakar sadhana main leen rahe
 Eventually Pawan Dev took care
 hawa kaa bahna bilkul tham gaya
 The slow flowing air began to erase all the tiredness of the body
 akashwani hui- "he raja vikramaditya, tumhaari sadhana se ham prasann hue
 State your wish
 " The next moment Vikram returned to normalcy and folded his hands and said that he wanted the presence of Pawan Dev in the Mahayagya he was doing
 pawan dev ke padhaarney se unke yajna kii shobhaa badhegi
 Vikram got so emotional that Pawan Dev laughed
 unhone jawaab diya ki sasharir yajna main unki upasthiti asambhav he
 If they go to the body, there will be a severe storm in the kingdom of Vikram
 saare lahalhate khet, ped-paudhe, mahal or jhopadiyaan- sab kii sab ujaad jaayengi
 There is talk of their presence, they live in every corner of the world, so they will also be present indirectly in that Mahayagya
 vikram unka abhipraay samajhakar chup ho gaye
 While blessing him, Pawan Dev said that there will never be any drought in his kingdom and his subjects will never face famine
 uske baad unhone vikram ko kamdhenu gaay dete hue kaha ki isaki krupa se kabhi bhi vikram ke rajya main doodh kii kami nahin hogi
 When Pawanadeva vanished, Vikramaditya recalled both the belts and Betal brought them to the boundary of his kingdom
 jis brahman ko vikram ne samudr devtaa ko aamantrit karne kaa bhaar saunpa tha, vah kaaphi kathinaaiyon ko jhelta hua sagar tat par pahunchaa
 He entered the ocean up to the waist and called for the sea god
 usne baar-baar doharaaya ki maharaja vikramaditya mahayajna kar rahe hai or vah unka doot banakar unhen aamantrit karne aayaa he
 At last, the sea gods appeared in front of him from the depths
 unhone brahman se kaha ki unhen us mahayajna ke bare main pawan devtaa ne sab kuch bataa diya he
 They welcome Vikramaditya's invitation just like Pawan Dev, but the body cannot attend
 brahman ne samudr devtaa se apana aashay spasht karne kaa sadar nivedan kiya, to ve bole ki agar ve yajna main sammilit hone gaye to unke saath athaah jal bhi jayega or uske raasten main padanevaali har chiz dub jaaegi
 a cataclysm situation will arise all around
 sab kuch nasht ho jayega
 When the Brahmin wanted to know what his orders were for him, the sea god said that he wishes Vikram to have a successful Mahayagya
 apratyaksh rup main yajna main aadyopati vikram unhen mahasoos karenge, kyonki jal kii ek-ek boond main unka vaas he
 They will also be present in the water used in the sacrificial fire
 uske baad unhone brahman ko paanch ratna or ek ghoda dete hue kaha- "meri ore se raja vikramaditya ko ye uphaar de dena
 "the Brahmin came back with a horse and a gem
 usko paidal chalata dekh vah ghoda manushya kii boli main usase bolaa ki is lambey safar ke liye vah uski peeth par savaar kyon nahin ho jaataa
 When he refuses, the horse explains to him that he is the king's messenger, so he can use his gift
 brahman jab raji hokar baith gaya to vah ghoda pawan veg se use vikram ke darbar le aayaa
 During the ride of the horse, he wished in his mind - "I wish! This horse would be mine!" When Vikram elaborated his conversation with the sea god and gave them his spray, he should have received the five gems and the horse from him, as he laughed all the difficulties on the way for the king

 niveshak yaa to santhaan yaa nijee niveshak ho sakate hai
 The term asset management is often used to refer to investment management of collective investments, while more general fund management can mean all forms of institutional investment as well as investment management of private investors

 Many of the world's largest companies under financial services avoidance are at least partially investment managers, employing millions and generating billions of revenue
 fund manager kaa matlab nivesh prabandhan seva pradaan karne vaali ek company ke saath-saath kosh prabandhan sambandhi faisle dene vaala ek vyakti bhi ho saktaa he
 There are many aspects of the investment management business including the appointment, research, bargaining, settlement, marketing, internal auditing of professional fund managers, and preparation of reports for clients

 mahatvapurn samasyaon main shaamil hai: Institutions often control large stakes
 zyaadaatar maamalon main ve pramukh maalikon ke bajaay vishwasashrith agenton ke rup main kaary kar rahi hai
 Theoretically, the owners of the shares have a lot of power to bring change in the companies they own through the voting rights they get from their shares, and then the ability to pressure the management and the annual and if needed Other meetings also have the ability to exclude them through voting
 vyaavhaarik taur par sheyaron ke antim maalik aksar samuhik rup se praapt apni shakti kaa istemaal nahin karte hai lekin vittiya sansthaaen kabhi-kabhi aisa karti hai
 There is a general belief that shareholders - in this case, entities acting as agents - can and should exert a more active influence on the companies in which they hold shares
 Such action will include a pressure group among the management watchdogs
 haalanki samasya yah he ki sanstha ko is shakti kaa istemaal kaise karnaa chahie
 iske liye sanstha ke paas ek rasta faisla lene kaa or doosraa rasta apane labhaarthiyon kaa surveykshan karnaa he
 Assuming that the institution resorts to survey or election, should the entire share be voted on as directed by the majority of the votes cast? Or should voting be divided according to the voting ratio? Or should voting be held only on the shares of the respondents, respecting the predators? share dhaaran karne yaa na karne vaale bade sakriy prabandhakon dwaara die jane vaale keemat sambandhi sanketon se prabandhan parivartan main yogadan mil saktaa he
 For example, this is the case when a large active manager sells his position to a company, resulting in a fall in the share price, but more importantly, the market's trust in the company's management Losses occur and thus change rapidly in the management team
 kuch sansthaaen aise baton kaa anukaran karne main adhik mukhar or sakriy hoti hai, kuch companiyon kaa maananaa he ki paryaapt alpsankhyak hissedariyon jamaa karne or kaarobaar main mahatvapurn badlaav laane ke liye prabandhan par dabaav daalane se nivesh laabh praapt hota he
 In some cases, institutions with minority stakes work together to force management to change
 prerak baatcheet or piaar ke madhyam se prabandhan tiimon par bade sansthaanon dwaara nirantar daale jane vaale dabaav shaayad aksar adhik hote hai
 On the other hand, some of the largest investment managers, such as Blackrock and Vanguard, advocate establishing ownership over each company by reducing incentives to influence management teams
 is antim ranneeti kaa ek kaaran yah he ki nivesh prabandhak company kii prabandhan team ke saath ek kareebi, adhik khulaa or nishkapat sambandh sthapit karnaa pasand karte hai jo unke niyantran prayaas par hi tikaa rah saktaa he jisase unhen behatar nivesh nirnay karne main madad milti he

 in parisampattiyon ke bich kosh ke aavanton ke kaam ko anjaam dene ke liye hi nivesh prabandhan companiyon ko bhugtan kiya jaataa he
 Asset classes exhibit different market dynamics and different mutual effects, which will have a significant impact on the management of the fund by the allocation of money between asset classes
 Some research suggests that allocations between asset classes have more predictive power in determining portfolio returns than choice of individual shares

 The reason for this according to financial theory is that equity is more risky than bonds while bonds are more risky than cash

 Fund performance is often considered the criterion of fund management and accurate measurement is a requirement in an institutional context

 It is generally said that it is probably best for an investment company to persuade its clients to assess performance over long periods to ease the short-term fluctuations in the performance and impact of the business cycle
 haalanki yah kaam mushkil sabit ho saktaa he or udyog kii drushti se alpakaalik sankhyaon ke saath ek gambhir talleenta aa jaati he or clienton ke saath sthapit sambandhon par asar padane lagata he
 a permanent problem is that performance measurement should be done before or after tax
 Post-tax performance represents an investor's profit but the investor's tax position may vary
 kar-purv pradarshan khaas taur par niyam kii drushti se bhraamak ho saktaa he jisase praapt puunjigat laabh par kar lagata he
 Thus it is possible that successful active managers can produce tragic post-tax results
 iskaa ek sambhav samaadhaan yah he ki kisi maanak karadaata ko kar-pashchaat sthiti kii report di jaae
 Performance measurement should not only be limited to the evaluation of fund returns but it is also necessary to integrate other fund elements into it which will be of interest to investors such as measurement of risk taken
 Several other aspects are also part of performance measurement: assessing whether managers have succeeded in meeting their objectives, ie whether their returns were sufficiently high for the risks taken; How is his position compared to his colleagues; And ultimately the results of portfolio management were derived from luck or because of the manager's skills
 The need to answer all these questions has led to the development of more sophisticated performance measurements, many of which have their origins in modern portfolio theory
 aadhunik portpholio siddhant ne maatraatmak kadi kii sthapana kii jo portpholio jokhim or pratifal ke bich maujuud he
 The Capital Asset Pricing Model developed by Sharp highlighted the assumption of risk aversion and introduced the first performance indicators, whether they were risk-adjusted ratios or differential returns compared to norms
 The Sharpe Ratio is the simplest and most well-known performance measurement
 yah portpholio ke kul jokhim kii tulana main jokhim mukt dar kii adhikta main portpholio ke pratifal kii maap karata he
 This measure is considered absolute because it does not refer to a criterion and stays away from deficiencies related to poor choice of criterion
 is bich yah bazaar ke pradarshan ke algaav kii anumati nahin detaa he jisamen prabandhak kii taraf se portpholio kaa nivesh kiya gaya he
 The information ratio is the more common form of sharp ratio in which a risk-free asset is replaced by a criterion portfolio
 yah maap saapeksh he kyonki ek maandand ke sandarbh main portpholio pradarshan kaa moolyankan karata he jisase parinaam kaaphi had tak is maandand vikalp par aadhaarit hota he
 Portfolio alpha is obtained by measuring the difference between the return of the portfolio and the return of the criterion portfolio
 yah maap sakriy prabandhan kaa moolyankan karne ke liye ekmaatr vishwasaneey pradarshan maap prathit hota he
 The difference between the normal returns we get through passive management from abnormal performance due to the manager's skill, in fact provided by the appropriate reward for portfolio exposure, whether market timing, stock peaking or fortunately for various risks Have to install

 Only the latter component, measured by alpha, allows the evaluation of the manager's true performance
 kaarak modelon kaa istemaal karke portpholio pratifal kaa moolyankan kiya ja saktaa he
 The first model proposed by Jensen relies on the CAPM and interprets portfolio returns with the market index as the sole factor
 haalanki yah turant spasht ho jaataa he ki bahut acchhee tarah se pratifalon kii vyakhya karne ke liye keval ek kaarak kaaphi nahin he or isliye anya karkon par bhi vichaar karnaa chahie
 siepiem ke ek vikalp ke rup main bahu-kaarak modelon kaa vikaas kiya gaya jo portpholio jokhimon ke behatar varnan or portpholio ke pradarshan ke adhik sateek moolyankan kii anumati detaa he
 For example, Fama and French have highlighted two important factors that characterize a company's risk in addition to market risk
 ye kaarak kitaab se bazaar tak kaa anupaat or company ke bazaar puunjikaran dwaara maapit company kaa aakaar hai
 Hence Fama and French proposed a three-factor model to describe the normal returns of the portfolio
 Carhart proposed the inclusion of momentum as a fourth factor to focus on the short-term persistence of yields
 In addition, Sharp's style analysis model is also of interest for performance measurement in which factors are style indices
 yah model prayek portpholio ko viksit karne ke liye ek prathagat maandand kii anumati detaa he jiske tahat style suchakaankon ke raikhik sangyojan kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jo portpholio style aavanton ko sabase behatar dhang se doharaate hai or jiske falswaroop portpholio alpha kaa sateek moolyankan praapt hota he
 International vocational schools are increasingly incorporating the subject into their curriculum framework and some schools have even created the title of 'investment management' or 'asset management' as specialist undergraduate degrees

 shiya-sunni vivaad islam ke sabase puraani or ghaatak ladaaiyon main se ek he
 It began in 632, after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, in the battle for the successor position of Islam
 kuch logon kaa kahana tha ki mohammad sahab ne apane chachere bhai or damaad ali ko islam kaa vaaris banaaya he jabaki anya logon ne mana ki mohammad sahab ne sirf hazarat ali kaa dhyaan rakhane ko kaha he or asli vaaris abu bakar ko hona chahie 
 Those who supported Ali's succession were called Shia while the supporters of Abu Bakr's leader were called Sunnis
 dhyaan den ki vastav main abu bakar ko caliph banaaya gadha or iske do caliphaaon ke baad hi ali ko caliph banaaya gaya
 This led to fighting on both sides
 duusare, tisare or chauthe caliphaaon kii hatya kar di gai thi - in khalifaaon ke naam hai umr, osman or ali
 The Shia count their leaders from Ali and call their leader the Imam in lieu of the Caliph
 mohammad ke netritv main puraa arabi prayadweep ek mat or samrajya ke adheen pehali baar aayaa tha
 The differences arose from the race to become the authority of such a large empire
 hazarat ali, jo mohammad sahab ke chachere bhai or damaad donon the, hi hazrat mohammad sahab ke asli uttaradhikari the or unhen hi pehla caliph bananaa chahie tha
 However this did not happen and he was made Khalifa, ie the head leader, after three more people
 ali or unke baad unke vanshajon ko islam kaa pramukh bananaa chahie tha, aisa vishvas rakhane vaale shiya hai
 Sunni Muslims believe that the first four Caliphs, including Hazrat Ali, were Satapathis, while Shia Muslims believe that the first three Caliphs were non-legitimate heads of Islam and that they start counting the Imams from Hazrat Ali and that the use of the word Khalifa in this count do not do
 sunni ali ko caliph maanate he or unke putr hossain ko maravane vaale caliph yajid ko kai jagahon par pathbhrasht muslim kehete hai
 Although it was just a matter of succession and Hazrat Ali too became the Caliph after many years, but this led to discrimination in the Muslim community which lasted for centuries
 aaj duniya main, sunni bahumat main hai par shiya vishwaas iran, iraq samet kai deshon main pradhan he
 The art and practice of discussing and negotiating an issue by representatives of nations or groups is called diplomacy
 aaj ke vaigyanik yug main koi desh alag-alag nahin rah saktaa
 In these countries, it has become necessary to add mutual relations in these countries
 in sambandhon ko jodne ke liye yogya vyakti ek desh se duusare desh main bheje jate hai
 These people, by their ability, skill and diplomacy, often make friends of another country
 pracheen kaal main bhi ek rajya duusare rajya se kootnithik sambandh jodne ke liye apane kootneetijna bhejtaa tha
 Earlier, diplomacy used to mean 'in the deal or transaction, the sentence is chaturi, deceit-deception, cheating
' jo vyakti kam mulya dekar adhikadhik laabh apane desh ke liye praapt karata tha, kushal kootneetijna kehalaata tha
 But today, deceit is not called diplomacy
 vaigyanik drushti se aadhunik kaal main is shabd kaa prayog do rajyon main shantipurna samjhaute ke liye kiya jaataa he
 For diplomacy, the word diplomacy is being used in place of diplomacy in Hindi
 anterrashtriya jagat ek parivaar ke samaan ban gaya he
 It is the job of a skilled diplomat to add love, cooperation, goodwill and friendship among family members
 'rajnay' shabd angreji shabd 'diplomaisi' kaa hindi roopaantaran he
 The word diplomacy originated from the Greek word diplown which means to twist or repeat

 In the Roman Empire, passports and permission to walk on the streets were doubled and sealed

 The work of these employees was called a diplomatic act
 dhire-dhire is kaary vyapaar ke liye diplomasi shabd prayukt hone laga
 The word diplomacy has been used by thinkers in many ways
 herold nickelson ke anusaar kabhi iskaa prayog videsh niti ke samanarthak ke rup main liya jaataa he, jaise bhartiya rajnay padosi deshon main safal nahin rahi
 Sometimes the term refers to treaty negotiations, such that this problem can be solved by diplomacy
 rajnay sandhi vaarta kii prakriya evam yantra ko bhi ingit karata he
 Sometimes a branch of the Foreign Service is called diplomacy
 rajnay ko anterrashtriya sandhi vaarta karne kaa amoort gun yaa kushalta bhi maan liya jaataa he
 Its most corrupt use is when it is taken in a fraudulent act
 is prakaar rajnay shabd vibhinn arthon main prayeg kiye jane ke kaaran pathak ke man main bhram utpann kar detaa he
 Perhaps the term is most confusing in political science
 is vishay main aargensky ne kaha he ki 'kushalta, chaturaai evam kapat’ sareekhe gun ek achche rajnay ke lakshan ho sakate hai kintu inhen rajnay ko paribhaashit karne vaali visheshta nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 Not even equivalent to diplomatic foreign policy
 yah videsh niti kaa aisa ang he jo uski rachana or kriyanviti main sakriy yogadan karata he
 ' argenski ke ansaar- According to Sir Ernest Saints, is sambandh main paamar tathaa parkins ne yah jigyaasa prakat kii he ki yadi rajyon ke aapasi sambandhon main buddhi or chaaturya kaa abhaav he to kya rajnay asambhav hoga ? spasht he ki rajnay do athwa do se adhik swatantra rajyon ke madhya sthit sambandh he tadnusaar prayek rajya buddhi, kushalta evam chaaturya kaa prayog karata he
 In the words of KM Panikkar, quinci rhite ne rajnay ko do arthon main paribhaashit kiya he - lokapriy arth main tathaa vishesh arth main
 In the popular sense - is paribhaasha kii khaas baat yah he ki lokapriy arth main rajnay ko aisi sandhi-vaarta mana gaya he jo dabaav par nahin varan samajhane-bujhane par aadhaarit rahati he
 In its special sense, diplomats have been considered devotional towards the national interest
 raajnneeti shaastra main rajnay kaa lokapriy arth lagu nahin hota
 In international relations, diplomacy only works where there is a possibility of pressure
 rajnay dwaara in sambhaawanaaon ko dabaaya jaataa he
 The purpose of diplomacy is to make agreements and agreements are made only where there are some disagreements
 ye asahmatiyaan aisi honi chaiye jinamein vaarta dwaara sahmati kaayam kii ja sake
 Diplomacy is irrelevant in areas of absolute consensus and it is ineffective in areas of absolute disagreement
 rabrto regela ke anusaar rajnay shabd kaa kaaphi durupyog hua he
 Actually, diplomacy is a profession that involves many activities
 yah duniya ke aise kuch vyavsaayon main se ek he jisaki paridhi main maanviya kriya kii prayek shakha shaamil ho jaati he
 Its power politics is related to the struggle of economic power and ideologies
 regela rajnay ko ‘samjhauta vaarta kii kala’ maanata he
 In 1796, Edmund Burke, while defining diplomacy, wrote that diplomacy is the operation or operation of international relations
 george epa0 kenon kaa kahana he ki takneekee arth main rajnay kii vyavastha sarkaron ke bich sampark ke rup main kii ja sakati he
 Thus, different thinkers have given different definitions of diplomacy
 ye sabhi paribhaashayen purnatah upyukt nahin hai kyonki samay tathaa paristhitiyon main parivartan ke saath-saath rajnay kaa arth bhi badalata rahata he
 Many thinkers have considered diplomacy not only as an occupation but also an art
 adhikansh sarkarein apane hiton kii prapti evam abhivruddhi ke liye ise apnaane lagi he
 It is gradually becoming an effective means of peace
 shuru main rajya aseemit shaktiyon se sampann hote the faltah rajanyagyaan ko samprabhu mana jaataa tha
 They were given enough freedom to work
 is swatantraaa kaa anya kaaran yah tha ki us samay sanchaar ke drutagami sadhano kaa abhaav tha
 This widespread independence of diplomats began to be limited in the late 19th century
 us samay rajnay kii ek anya visheshta yah bhi thi ki rajanyagnon ko unke kaary se sambandhit aadesh tathaa nirdesh dekar hi bheja jaataa tha
 Nowadays it has not been necessary due to the convenience of rapid means of communication
 rajnay ko kuch log ek rahasypurna vyavsaay maanate hai
 this is not right
 hoodh gibason ke anusaar, ”asal main rajnay ek bhramasadhy vyavsaay he
 It is beyond magic or mystery
 ise kisi bhi anya sarkari kaary kii bhaanti ek gambheer vyavsaay ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Palmer and Parikans have described some features of diplomacy
 ye visheshtayen rajnay ke swaroop ko spasht karne ke liye upyogi siddh hogi
 These features are the following: - nickelson kaa yah kahana thik nahin he ki yuddh armbh hone par rajanyik kaary band ho jate hai, kyonki paamar or parkins ke vichaar se rajanyagnon kaa kaary desh kii raksha karnaa he
 Therefore, during the war, they do not sit hand in hand, but at that time they cooperate in military work

 During wartime, the work of diplomacy increases
 pichley do vishwayudhon kii ghatnaon ke avlokan se yah baat spasht ho jaati he
 To understand the nature of diplomacy, it is useful to study its relation and difference with foreign policy, international law and diplomatic politics
 pracheen bharat ke rajwanshon va rajyon main rajnay kii sudeergh parampara rahi he
 The earliest work on statecraft and diplomacy is Arthashastra, the credit of which goes to Kautilya, the principal adviser to Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Maurya dynasty
 arthshaastra rajtv kii kala par ek sampurna rachana he
 It also has the principles of diplomacy, which describes how intelligent kings form alliances between mutually competitive states and put their enemies in stalemate

 The policy to carry out the national program is 'policy'
 yah aantarik athwa bahari kisi bhi ho sakati he
 Internal policy is related to home affairs whereas foreign policy is related to the external arrangements of the nation
 videsh niti or rajnay, raajnneeti ke ve pahiye hai jinaki sahaayta se anterrashtriya raajnneeti chalati he
 Foreign policy is the fulfillment of its objectives in relation to other states by a nation
 aisi videsh niti ke bare main sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa jo rashtriya hiton kii upeksha karen
 Therefore, foreign policy is interpreted as the behavior of the state through which states fulfill their interests
 arvachin yug main koi rajya apane aap main parthaky kii niti apanaakar alag rah saken, yah sarvatha asambhav he
 Foreign policy is made with much thought because the future of the state depends only on its right decision
 videsh niti ke nirmaan main rajya ko kai tatwon kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he
 For example, the foreign policy of Britain and Japan has been deeply influenced by its geographical location
 rajyon ke prakritik strot athwa unka samrik mahatv aadi rajya kii videsh niti ko prabhavit karte hai
 Underdeveloped states, which continue to receive assistance from various powers and depend on them, can never form an independent foreign policy
 kisi desh kii sainik shakti uski videsh niti ko utsaahi banaakar galat maarg par le jaati he
 Germany, Italy and Japan invaded their neighboring states due to military power and called for world war
 rajyon kii raajnneeti tathaa unki videsh niti kaa nirmaan desh ke rajaneta karte hai, to rajdoot iskaa kriyanyavan
 In determining foreign policy, states have to take into account many perspectives of national and international situations
 jaise rajya kii bhugolic sthiti, aarthik aavashyaktaaen, prakritik strot, pratiraksha kii aavashyaktaaen tathaa sandhiyaan aadi
 Through this, efforts are made to make the adversary or enemy side powerless or the friendly state even more enigmatic
 videsh niti ke madhyam se rajyon ke madhya santulan banaaye rakhane athwa samuhik suraksha aadi ke kadam uthaaye jate hai
 The basic mantra of foreign policy is 'enemy of enemy is friend'
 china ne isi niti ke antargat bharat ke shatru pakistan ke saath maitri sambandh banaaye the
 Similarly, the objective of foreign policy is also to establish 'neutral borders'
 seemaa ke prashn ko lekar rajyon ke madhya sambandh praayah bigadate hai
 There has been a situation of war or war between countries like india-pakistan, india-china, russia-china etc

 States sometimes lose their right to free decisions in their efforts to attain power
 rajya kii videsh niti ke nirnay uski samrik sthiti tathaa sainik shakti par nirnay karte hai
 The more powerful the state is, the more successful its diplomacy will be

 The state can be active or passive in the field of foreign policy
 yadi rajya sakriy he to rajya ke samaksh chaar vikalp hote hai, jiske aadhaar par vah kaary karata he - raajnneetik aarthik, manovaigyanik tathaa sainik
 Depending on the time and situation, the state can adopt any one of these options or can use its combined form
 niskriyata vartmaan anterrashtriya paristhitiyon main kisi bhi rajya ke liye ghaatak siddh ho sakati he
 States often use the path of diplomacy
 videsh niti kaa uddeshy mitra rajyon ke saath sambandhon ke adhik pragadh or shatru paksh ko niskriy bananaa hota he
 Diplomacy is the tool that helps in achieving this objective through dialogue and cleverness
 videsh niti ke uddeshyon kii prapti kaa sarvocch evam mahatvapurn saadhan hi he
 In fact, foreign policy is the skill of diplomacy
 kisi bhi videsh niti kaa nirmaan in adhikariyon kaa kaary he, vahi duusare deshon ke sandarbh main iskaa kriyanvayan rajdooton kaa
 In this complex era of today, even though technically, the State Department alone is considered to be the creator of foreign policy, it cannot be denied that ambassadors also contribute significantly in its construction
 rajdoot kii gatividhiyaan uske desh kii videsh niti par aadhaarit rahati he
 Although it is true that ambassadors are not independent in its operation
 videsh niti or rajnay ek-duusare ke paryaay nahin hai
 Some scholars use them in place of each other in a bond-free manner
 inamen paryaapt antar he
 Foreign policy involves efforts to protect the interests of nations, establish relations between them and maintain them
 je0aar0 childs ke anusaar “kisi bhi desh kii videsh niti uske vaideshik sambandhon kaa saar he” jabaki “rajnay vah prakriya he jisaki sahaayta se videsh niti karyanvit kiya ja saktaa he
 "in the words of Sir Charles Waxter," Most of the assumptions of policy are meaningless even if there is no means to convert them into action
 ” yah kaary rajnay karata he The diplomatic relations between the states have been going on since time immemorial

 In Greece, Rome, and ancient India, diplomatic relations were very extensive, and the rules determining these relations were also formulated

 According to Nicholson, this has only happened that diplomacy has changed itself according to the new changing circumstances
