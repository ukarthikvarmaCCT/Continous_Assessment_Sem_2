 jyamiti yaa rekhganit ganit kii teen vishaal shakhaon main se ek he
 In this, the properties, measurements and relative position of the points, lines, planks and solids are studied in their space
 jyamiti, gyaan kii sabase pracheen shakhaon main se ek he
 Geometry is that branch of mathematics in which the study of points, lines, curves, planes, etc
, is studied
 bhoomi ke naap sambandhi kaaryon se is vigyaan kii utpatti hui, isaliye is ganit ko bhumiti bhi kehete hai
 Initially this study was limited to the properties of lines and areas surrounded by lines, due to which geometry is also named Geometry
 bharat main yagyavediyon ke nirmaan kaary main ganitagyon kaa dhyaan jyamiti ke adhyayan kii or aakrisht kiya, unke adhyayan main kshetrasmiti kaa put adhik tha
 Historians believe that Indians knew such relationships as 32 + 42 = 52, 1,000 years before Christ, but they did not study such relationships in any other way except for some similar small equations
 isa se lagbhag 600 varsh purv rome ke ganitagya pithagoras ne is sambandh kaa bade tarkpurna dhang se adhyayan kiya or yah bataaya ki ek samakon tribhuj main karn par kaa varg anya bhujaaon ke upar virgon ke yogafal ke baraabar hota he
 Although the study of geometry started almost simultaneously in all the old civilized countries, such as Egypt, Babylonia, China, India and Greece, but no other country has progressed as much in this science as Greece
 isa se lagbhag 300 varsh purv yunaan ke ek ganitaj euclid ne us samay tak jitne tathy gyaat the un sabko bade tarkpurna dhang se krambaddh kiya
 He tried to prove other facts on the basis of known facts
 is prakaar tathyon ko krambaddh karne par vah kuch aise praarambhik tathyon par pahunchaa jinako siddh karnaa kathin he
 Well they seem very clear
 ye tathy itane saral hai ki euclid ne inhen swayansiddh maan liya or inhen swayan tathy kaha he
 The proof of theorems of geometry is dependent on these facts
 ve tathy nimnlikhit hai : 1
 Those things, which are equal to the same thing, are also equal among themselves
 2
 yadi baraabar vastuon main baraabar vastuen jod di jaayan to yogafal baraabar hote hai
 3
 If equal items are subtracted from equal items then the remainder are equal
 4
 baraabar vastuon ke samaan gune baraabar hote hai
 5
 If two lines intersect the third line and the sum of the inner angles of one side is less than two right angles, then where the joint is less, the two lines will meet at a point when extended
 6
 isi prakaar rachanakaarya main bhi ek rachana se duusari rachana kar sakate hai, parantu ant main kuch aisi rachanaaon par pahonchte hai jinka prayog duusare prayogon par nirbhar nahin karata
 These compositions can also be taken forward by considering themselves
 ve Apart from these, they do not accept any other facts without proving them
 uparyukt paanch swayan tathyon main se chaar to itane saral tathaa sapsht hai ki inhen siddh karnaa apane haath ko apana siddh karne ke baraabar he, parantu paanchavaan swayantathy swayansiddh sa prathit nahin hota
 Mathematicians objected to this fact as axiomatic and tried hard to prove it
 inhen yatnon ke falswaroop bade bade avishkaar hue
 Similarly, new geographical terms are mentioned in geometry
 ek shabd kii paribhaasha duusare shabdon kii paribhaasha par nirbhar karti he
 Finally, let us see that these definitions are based on the definitions of point, line and plane
 euclid ke anusaar samtal vah he jisamen lambaai chaudaai ho, parantu motaai na ho
 Many people are skeptical of this definition as well, but a little reflection will make it clear that the definition is correct
 udaahranarth, yadi kaanch ke ek baratan main do aise taral padaarth bhar die jaayan jo aapas main na milte ho to jab ve sthir ho jaayan tab ham dekhgen ki ek tal donon padaarthon ko alag karata he
 It does not have thickness
 yadi hoti to donon taralon ke bich aisa sthaan hota jisamen na neeche kaa padaarth hota na upar kaa, parantu aisa asambhav he
 This example would have made it clear that the floor does not have thickness
 isamen keval lambaai or chaudaai hi hoti he
 Similarly, looking at the shade of a flat wall in the sun, we can say that the line does not have width
 rekha tal main sthit he, at: tal kii motaai rekha kii motaai hui
 Therefore the line has neither thickness nor width, only length
 rekhaayen ek bindu par milti hai to rekha kii chaudaai bindu kii lambaai hui, arthath bindu main na lambaai hoti he, na chaudaai, motaai
 There is only space
 sabhi is baat se parichit honge ki jyamiti main tribhuj, varg, vrutt, shanku, belan ityadi ke gunon kaa adhyayan hota he1 puraane samay main kuch prashnon ne ganitagyon ko kaaphi uljhaae rakhaa
 The solutions to those questions gave a lot of thought, there is no doubt in this, like making a cube whose cube is twice the given cube
 us samay rachana kaa arth patari or parkaar kii sahaayta se hi rachana karnaa samajha jaataa tha
 The second question was to make a square whose area is equal to the area of the given circle
 teesraa prashn tha ki ek die hue kone ko teen baraabar bhaagon main baantna
 This work is impossible with track and compass, but can be done by other means
 in prashnon ne shatabdiyon tak ganitagyon ko vyast rakhaa
 Mathematics was greatly benefited by his deliberations, no doubt
 ek shanku ko kisi samtal se kaatane se jo dirghavritt, paravalay, tathaa atiparavalay vakr banate hai unke gunon kaa bhi unaniyon ne adhyayan kiya
 These studies may have helped Kaplan in finding his rules
 15veen shatabdi tak jyamiti main praaia: naap sambandhi gunon kaa hi adhyayan hota tha, parantu uske baad aise gunon kaa bhi adhyayan hua jo naap par nirbhar nahin karte; jaise yadi do tribhujon ke sheershabindu ek teen bindugami rekha par hon to sangat bhujaayen ek rekha par milengi
 This goal attracted the attention of mathematicians to another type of geometry called projectional geometry
 yadi ham kisi drishy ke chitra par dhyaan den to anubhav karte hai ki use dekhakar drishy kaa puraa gyaan ho jaataa he
 But in the picture, the circle is not a circle, neither all the parallel lines are parallel, neither the right angle is the right angle, but sometimes the right angle is seen to be a right angle, sometimes more angle; Nevertheless, there are some such qualities in the scene that even after changing the shapes, they get complete knowledge from the picture
 ye gun nishchar kehalaate hai
 Similar properties are studied in projectional geometry
 maan len, ek bindu ba or ek chaturbhuj k kha ga gha diya hua he
 If the lines joining each point of the quadrilateral are drawn from point b and extend them and then cut these lines from a plane, a drawing will be made on this plane
 vah is chaturbhuj kaa prakshep tathaa yah prayog bindu ba ke saapeksh roopantaran kehalaayegaa
 Similarly, by taking a second point, you can also interpolate this interpolation relative to it
 jo gun nahin badalte unhen prakshep dwaara kisi saral bahubhuj main badalakar adhyayan karte hai
 These properties will also be good for the original polygon
 saath hi kai roopantaran milakar ek roopantaran prayog ke samaan hote hai
 The study of these experiments is also a part of this geometry
 yadi kisi gole yaa vrutt kaa centre k ho tathaa trigya tra ho or yadi kisi bindu ba kii centre k se duuri r ho or yadi r' duuri par rekha k ba main ba' doosraa bindu ho, jahaan r1 tra2 to ba ke kisi bindupath ke sangat ba' kaa bhi path hoga
 The path of b is called the inverse of the path of B
 prayek kshetra pratilomon kaa adhyayan hi is shakha kaa dhyey he
 The 5th axiomatic fact of Euclid has been given above
 ise swayansiddh maanane ke liye ganitagya kabhi taiyaar nahin hue, balki unhone ise siddh karne ke bade bade ytn kiye; parantu kaai santoshjanak uttar nahin mila
 Mathematics developed a lot as a result of research and a geometry was invented which created a complete revolution in geometry
 euclid ne samtal par hi sab vivechan kiye, parantu ab har prakaar ke talon par alag alag vivechnaayen hoti hai
 Its interpretation is difficult, so for this, the readers should look at the special books on this subject
 17veen shatabdi ke madhya main francisi ganitagya decort ne jyamiti main bijganit kaa prayog kar ise bahut shaktishaalee bana diya
 He first took two cutting lines, called axes
 kisi bindu kii in rekhaon ke samaantar naapi hui duuri do sankhyaon ya r se uskaa sthaan nishchay kiya
 These lines are called the coordinates of the point
 in nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se prayek jyamitiya tathy ko bijaganitiya sameekaran dwaara pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 This geometry developed in many directions
 pehali dasha main to jyamiti kaa vyapak rup saamne aayaa, jaise ek ghaat kaa sameekaran ek saral rekha pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equation of two powers represents a conic
 isi prakaar teen, chaar or ucchtar ghaaton ke samikarnon kaa adhyayan hone laga or unke sangat vakron ke gunon kaa vivechan pehle se bahut saral ho gaya
 It became possible to study not only the curves of the floor but also the curves of the recess
 iske liye ek bindugami teen samatalon se kisi bindu kii duriyon ya r l na uskaa sthaan nishchit karte hai or prayek bindupath ko ya, r, l main ek sameekaran dwaara pradarshit karte hai
 By considering these equations, the properties of the planes and curves are easily studied
 duusari disha main rachana sambandhi prashnon kaa hal tathaa kriyaayein bahut saral ho gayi
 These verbs depend only on the solution of some equations, in which very broad questions are easily solved; For example, if the line intersects a curve = o, the solution of both these equations will determine the location of their intersection points
 yadi in samikarnon ke mul vaastavik hai, to rekha vakr ko katati he
 If equal, the line touches the curve
 yadi kaalpanik hai to rekha vakr ko nahin katati, parantu ham yah kah sakate hai ki rekha vakr ko sadaiv do binduon par kaategi, chaahe bindu vaastavik yaa sampati hon, athwa kaalpanik hon
 Similarly, facts can be given in a very broad form, which was not possible in ordinary geometry
 teesri disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne vimiti ko vyapak kiya
 Two numbers are Y, r in two dimensions and three numbers determine the position of a point in three dimensions
 ab ganitagyon ke saamne yah prashn uthaa ki chaar sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va yaa paanch sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va, ha kya pradarshit karengi
 Mathematicians thought very easily in their minds that abstract four numbers would determine the position of a point in four dimensions and five numbers in five dimensions
 is prakaar unhone sa vimitiyon kaa vichaar bhi acchhee tarah soch liya
 He does not mean whether there is any example of him in the earthly world
 instine ne avashya is vichaar kaa apane saapeksh siddhant main upyog kiya or vimiti ke vichaar kaa spashtikaran kiya
 Now use this idea of high dimensionality to solve some difficult problems in untapped mathematics
 jaise kisi chal taral padaarth ke bhinn bhinn kanon kaa sthaan, saat sankhyaon se pradarshit karte hai
 They are A, B, C, its initial position, and three velocities, which are parallel to Y, R, l axis, and time, this can be solved by considering the question of seven dimensions
 chauthi disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne sankhyaon kaa vyapkikaran kiya or kaalpanik sankhyaon kaa aavirbhaav hua
 Concepts such as hypothetical points and imaginary curves, etc
, made geometry very important, which further helped in generalization, such as the conic circle going from two imaginary points at infinity, etc
 iske atirikt jyamiti kaa vivechan bhinn bhinn prakaar ke nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se hone laga, jaise samghaateey nirdeshaank, trikoniya nirdeshaank, sparsheey nirdeshaank ityadi
 Almost 50 years after the use of coordinates, calculus was also used in geometry
 is prayog ne jyamiti main nai nai vichaardhaaraen utpann kin
 These are called differential geometry

 By this definition, aptitude is the common direct means by which humans coordinate different experiences
 yah vah maapdand he jiske dwaara vyaktitv ke nirmaan main saamaajik tathaa bauddhik gunon kaa samavesh hota he
 Psychologists have divided attitudes on the basis of their object base, their intensity and their response
 iskaa ghanishtha sambandh vyakti ke amoort vichaar tathaa kalpana se hi he
 The birth of aptitude is often seen through four means - first by coordination, second by trauma, third by distinction and fourth by acceptance
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki ye yantra swatantra rup se hi kaary kare; aisa bhi dekha gaya he ki inamen ek yaa do karan bhi milakar abhivruti ko janm dete hai

 prayogon dwaara yah bhi dekha gaya he ki abhivruti ke nirmaan main mata pita, samudaay, shiksha pranali, cinema, samvegatmak paristhitiyon tathaa soochyata kaa vishesh haath hota he
 The question of measuring attitude has always been difficult for psychologists, but in today's era, a lot of work has been done in this direction

 The Psychology School, Allahabad, has Indianised some methods
 abhivritti ko vyavhaar se purv kii manodaihik avasthaa yaa pravriti ke rup main hamane samajha he
 Now the question arises whether other such states or tendencies such as habit, interests, modesty and basic motivators should also be named as expressions
 The answer is yes
 abhivritti in sabhi visheshtaon se alag pravriti he

 In the present era, the internal combustion engines used in cars, trucks, motorcycles and aircraft, etc
, are usually four stroke engines
 'chaar stroke' kaa matlab he ki eendhan se yantric urja main parivartan kaa chakra kul chaar charnon main puraa hota he
 These steps or strokes are called intake, compression, combustion, and emission, respectively
 dhyaan dene kii baat he ki in chaar charnon ko puraa karne main cranksashaft ko do chakkar lagane padate hai
 Currently, four stroke engines are commonly used in trains
 isse pehle gadiyon main tu stroke ingine kaa prayog hua karata tha, lekin kam milage or jivan avadhi kam hone ke kaaran iskaa sthaan four stroke ingine ne le liya
 The four-stroke engine was first patented in 1854 by Eugenio Baranti and Felice Matuacci
 iske baad 1860 main iskaa pratham prototip nikaala
 French engineer Alphonse Beau de Roca also independently explored the theory and extracted it in 1861 in his paper
 german ejeeniyar nicholas aato ne 1876 main is ingine kaa kaaryshil praturup nikaala
 For this reason, the four-stroke principle today is called auto-cycle and the spark plugs used in this engine are often called auto engines
 auto-chakra main jhadiabetic sampeedan, sthir aaytan par ooshmaa sangyojan, jhadiabatic vistaar evam sthir aaytan par ooshmaa asweekruti charan aate hai
 a four-stroke engine undergoes a complete cycle, ie four processes at a time
 jinhen angrezi main stroke kaha jaataa he
 Each engine has a hollow cylinder, called a cylinder
 silinder ke bheetar ek piston chalata he, jise ham mushali kah sakate hai
 The work of this piston is exactly the same as that of the stopper within the childrens playing paint
 piston aluminium yaa ispaat kaa banataa he or isamen ispaat kii kamanidaar chudiyaan lagi rahati hai, jisase vaayu yaa gas, piston ke ek ore se duusari ore nahin ja sakati
 The cylinder forehead is closed, but it has two valves
 ek ke khulne par vaayu, yaa vaayu or petrol kaa mishran, bheetar aa sakate hai
 The air or gas inside the cylinder may exit when the other is opened
 maathe main ek spark plag bhi laga rahata he jiske sire par do taar hote hai
 At the appropriate time, a spark of light emits between these two wires, which is automatically controlled when the engine is running
 crank kaa kaam he piston ke aage peeche chalane kii gati ko dhuree ke akshaghurnan main badalata
 The crank rotates when the piston moves back and forth due to the crank
 idhan ke baar-baar jalane se piston bahut garam na ho jaae is vichaar se silinder kii deevaaren hoti hai or unke bich pump dwaara pani pravaahit hota rahata he
 In motorcar etc
, there are four, six or eight cylinders instead of one, and the iron feature in which they remain is called a block

 The spindle on which the cam is mounted is called cam-axle
 yah dhuree ingine se hi chalati rahati he or vaalvon ko uchit samayon par kholti rahati he
 The valve remains closed if it stays under; The valve rises when its long section rotates and falls under the stem of the valve
 ) It is absolutely necessary to keep several oil treaties, where one body rotates or moves on the other, to be dampened with equal oil
 isiliye sarvatra snehak tel pahunchaane kaa prabandh rahata he
 In motorcars, the lower part of the engine is often in the form of a platter in which oil is poured
 prayek chakkar main crank tel main dub jaataa he or chhinte udaakar silinder ko bhi tel se tar kar detaa he
 Pumping is done to deliver oil to other places
 chaturghaat chakra ke anusaar kaam karanevaale injanon main piston ke chaar baar chalane par iske kaarykram kaa ek chakra puraa hota he
 These four are the following: ab flihil kii jhonk se phir piston vaayu or petrol chusata he, use sampidit karata he, idhan jalakar shakti utpann karata he or jali gaisen baahar nikalati hai 
 This sequence continues until the sparks are closed by closing the switch

 Four stroke engines have many benefits
 yah ingine kii shakti dakshata ko badhaata he
 This improves the efficiency of the car
 tu-stroke kii apeksha ingine main kam garmi paidaa hoti he
 Full use of energy increases the lifespan of the engine and throws out less smoke

 In a two-stroke engine, both cycles of energy are completed in a single cycle of the crack-shaft, whereas in a four-stroke engine, two cycles of the crank-shaft can complete four cycles of energy

 duusare punik yuddh ke dauraan hui jab roman senaaon ne general marcus cloudius marcelas ke netritv main do saal kii gheraabandi ke baad seracus shahar par kabza kar liya
 According to the popular description given by Plutarch, Archimedes was considering a mathematical figure when the city was captured
 ek roman sainik ne unhen aakar general marcelas se milane kaa aadesh diya, lekin unhone yah kahkar inkaar kar diya ki unhen apni samasya par kaam puraa karnaa he
 This angered the soldier and killed Archimedes with his sword
 plutark archimedes kii mrityu kaa bhi ek vivaran dete hai lesser-known jisamen yah kaha gaya he ki sambhavatya unhen tab maar diya gaya jab ve ek roman sainik ko samarpan karne kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 According to this story, Archimedes was carrying a mathematical device and was killed because the soldier thought it was valuable
 kaha jaataa he ki archimedes kii mrityu se general marcelas bahut krodhit hue, kyonki ve unhen ek amuly vaigyanik sampati maanate the or unhone aadesh die the ki archimedes ko kisi bhi prakaar kaa nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya janaa chahie
 Archimedes' last words were believed to be, "do not disturb my circles", the accounts here refer to the circles of the mathematical picture that Archimedes was studying when the Roman soldier harassed him

 unhone archimedes ke makbare ke bare main kahaniyaan suni thim, lekin sthaneey logon main se koi bhi isaki sthiti bataane main sakasham nahin tha
 He eventually discovered this mausoleum near the Agrigentine Gate in Syracuse, it was in a very neglected condition and there were many shrubs growing on it
 siciro ne makbare ko saafe kiya or iske upar hui nakkashi ko dekh paae or us par shilaalekh ke rup main upasthit kuch chhandon ko padhaa
 Standard versions of Archimedes's life were written by historians of ancient Rome long after his death

 According to Vitruvius, a new crown of a laurel wreath was made for King Hero II and Archimedes was asked to find out whether the crown was made of pure gold or that the unscrupulous goldsmith had added silver to it
 archimedes ko mukut ko nuksaan pahunchaae bina is samasya kaa samaadhaan karnaa tha, isliye vah iske ghanatv kii gananaa karne ke liye ise pighla kar ek niyamit aakaar kii vastu main nahin badal saktaa tha
 While taking a bath, he noticed that when he went inside the tub, the water level in the tub rose and he realized that this effect could be used to determine the volume of the crown
 vyavhaarik prayojanon ke liye pani ko sampidit nahin kiya ja saktaa he, isliye duba hua mukut apane aaytan kii baraabar maatra ke pani ko pratisthapit karegaa
 The density of the crown can be obtained by dividing the weight of the crown by the volume of water replaced
 yadi isamen saste or kam ghanatv vaale dhaatu milaaye gaye hai to iskaa ghanatv sone se kam hoga
 What was then, Archimedes became so excited by his discovery that he forgot to wear clothes and ran in the streets in a naked state shouting "eureka!" sone ke mukut kii kahani archimedes ke gyaat kaaryon main prakat nahin hoti he
 Furthermore, due to the excessive amount of accuracy required in the measurement of water displacement, the feasibility of the method described by it has been questioned
 sambhavat: archimedes ne ek aisa hal diya jo jalsthitiki main archimedes ke siddhant naamak siddhant par lagu hota he, jise ve apane ek granth on floating bodis main varnit karte hai
 According to this theory, an object immersed in a liquid exerts a buoyancy force that is equal to the weight of the liquid it removes
 is siddhant kaa prayog karte hue, sone ke mukut ke ghanatv kii tulana thos sone se karnaa sambhav ho gaya hoga, iske liye pehle mukut ko sone ke ek namoonay ke saath ek paimaane par santulit kiya gaya hoga, phir tantra ko pani main dubaaya gaya hoga
 If the crown was less dense than gold, it would have replaced more water due to its greater volume and thus the buoyancy force applied to it would have been greater than the sample
 utplavakta main yah antar paimaane par dikhaayi diya hoga
 Galileo considered that "archimedes may have used this method, since, to be very precise, it is based on the performance given by Archimedes himself
" " a large part of the work by Archimedes in the field of engineering came from meeting the needs of his own city of Syracuse
 unani lekhak naukratis ke athenus ne varnit kiya ki kaise raja hiron II ne archimedes ko ek vishaal jahaaj, syracusia dizin karne ke liye kaha, jise vilasitapurna yatra karne ke liye, saamaan kii supplai karne ke liye or nausena ke yudhpot ke rup main prayukt kiya ja sake

 archimedes ke scru kaa upyog aaj bhi drav or kaneey thos jaise koyala or anaaj ko pump karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Archimedes' screw described by Vitruvius in Roman times was probably an improvement on the screw pump that was used to irrigate the hanging gardens of the Babylonians
 archimedes kaa panja ek hathiyaar he, mana jaataa he ki unhone seracus shahar kii raksha ke liye ise dizin kiya tha
 Also known as "the Ship Shaker", this claw had a crane-like arm from which a large metal hook hung

 It has been suggested that a large group of layers of heavily polished bronze or copper serve as mirrors, presumably which were used to focus sunlight onto the ship
 isamen paravalay paravarti ke siddhant kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha, jaise saura bhatti main kiya jaataa he
 a trial of Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Lonis Sakkas
 yah prayog athens ke baahar skaramjes nausena base par kiya gaya
 At this time 70 mirrors were used, each was polished with a copper and its size was about 5x3 feet
 The mirrors were placed in the direction of a plywood mock-up of a Roman warship about 160 feet away
 jab darpanon ko thik prakaar se focus kiya gaya, jahaaj kuch hi kshanon main aag kii lapaton main jalane laga
 The plywood was polished with tar paint on the ship, which further contributed to the combustion

 Archimedes has also been credited with improving the ability and accuracy of the catapult and invented the odometer during the First Punic War
 odometer ko ek gear se yukt ek gaadi kii pranali ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, jo har ek mile chalane ke baad ek gend ko ek paatr main daalati he
 Cicero briefly mentions Archimedes in his Dialogue de Rey Publica, in 129 BC after the siege of Syracuse
 a fictional conversation depicted in, c
 212 BC, General Marcus Claudius Marcellus is said to have brought back two systems in Rome, which were used to aid astronomy, the Sun, Moon and the Five Shows the motion of the planets
 siciro usee tarah kii pranali kaa ullekh karte hai jaisi pranali militus ke thels or needs ke yudoxs ke dwaara dizin kii gayi
 According to this dialogue, Marcellus kept one device as his personal loot from Syracuse and donated all the others to the Temple of Virtue in Rome
 siciro ke anusaar marcelas kii pranali ko geiyas salpikas gelis ke dwaara lukias furias philis ko darshaya gaya, jisane ise is prakaar se varnit kiya: It is a description of a planetarium or Orei)
 alegsendriya ke pappas ne kaha ki archimedes ne in nirdisht pranaaliyon ke nirmaan par ek pandulipi likhi he On sphere-making
 Modern studies in this area focus on the antikythera system, another device from ancient times that was probably designed for a similar purpose
 is prakaar kii nirmaanatmak pranali ke liye avakal gearing ke parishkrut gyaan kii aavashyaktaa rahi hogi
 It was once thought to be outside the range of technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera system in 1902 ensured that such devices were known to the ancient Greeks

 The oldest document in which Archimedes works is Archimedes Palimpsest
 In 1906, a Danish professor, John Ludwig Heiberg, visited Constantinople and examined the Gotskin parchment of prayer written in the 13th century AD
 unhone paaya ki yah ek palimpcest tha, ek paathya se yukt ek dastavej jise mitaae gaye puraane kaary ke upar likhaa gaya tha
 To make the palimpsest, the ink on it was scraped off and reused, a common practice in the Middle Ages, as parchment was expensive
