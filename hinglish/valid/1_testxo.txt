 uskaa maananaa tha ki uske mata -pita kii magaluon se nikatataa isolt ke liye sahi nahin he
 The ferocious and fanatical Garmlath used black magic to isolate Islott from the Magaloo, not allowing him to use a stick, not even entering Hogwarts, as he himself did
 12 saal uske saath rahane ke baad islot ne garmaleith kii chadi chura lee tathaa vah america upnivesh ke ore bhaag gayi or masachusets main rahane lagi

 He could attract everyone with his look
 aisa anumaan he ki uske manushya rup se daitya banane kaa kaaran apni amar hone kii chahat main aatma ko vibhajit karke horcrax bananaa tha
 Voldemort's eyes in the film are blue and the pupil rounded
 rolling ne voldemort kaa "saikadon varshon kaa dushtatam jaadugar" ke rup main varnan kiya he
 He described her as "highly psychotic, lacking the human response to other people's suffering"
 saath hi use apni kushi ke kaaran dusron, visheshkar magaluon, ke katl karne vaala dikhaaya he
 There was a lack of consciousness in him, he did not regret his actions but he did not even understand the importance of his extra humanity
 use na to manushya ke saath saahchary yaa mitrataa sthapit karnaa pasand nahin tha or na hi use kisi se pyaar yaa lagaav tha
 He considered himself superior and considered everyone inferior in front of him
 rolling ne yah bhi likhaa he ki vah " vastav main avishwasaneey dhang se takat kaa bhookha, naslvaadi" tha
 If he looked in the mirror mirror, he would see himself as "omnipotent and indestructible" as he wanted
 rolling ne yah bhi likhaa he ki vah vah apni maan va jaaduugarani meropi gont dwaara ek magalu va uske pita tom riddle par prem kaadhe ke falswaroop utpann hua tha, jo ek asafal pyaar kaa parinaam tha
 His mother dies due to the effects of decoction and the father leaving his mother, but if his mother had lived and loved him, everything would have changed
 vah aakarshan jiske kaaran tom riddle ke rup main janme balak kaa voldemort main parivartan hua vah bahut aavashyak he kyonki yahi vah sankalpana dikhaata he jiske kaaran is paatr kaa janm hua
 Like almost all the villains, Voldemort's eagerness causes his downfall
 vah mrityu se atyadhik bhay tha, jise usne sharmnaak tathaa ghrunit insaani kamajori bataayi he
 He had many signs of being egoistic
 apane praan bhakshiyon ke saamne voldemort ne yah mana he ki usne harry ke mata-pita par hamale kii badi keemat chukaai he, or phir usne yah avlokan kiya ki isamen kya galat hua or ant main vah ye dosha swayan par letaa he
 Rolling has written that his polymorphism would have been his last journey
 rolling ne voldemort or harry main antar bataate hue kaha he ki harry ne mrityu ko sweekaar kar liya tha is kaaran se vah ant main uski tulana main adhik taqatvar hokar ubhara
 Rolling throughout the series describes Voldemort as a highly powerful, intelligent and ruthless evil sorcerer

 In the last book, Voldemort was shown flying without any support, anyone who read or saw this was taken aback
 apane purvaj gonton kii tarah vah bhi sarpon se sarpbhasha main baat kar saktaa tha
 He got this skill from his ancestor Salazar Slytherin
 gont parivaar swayan kii baatcheet main bhi is bhashaa kaa prayog karte the
 This extraordinary trait may have been genetically ingested in it, as this tradition was followed in the Gaunt family to maintain purity of blood
 jab voldemort navjaat harry kii hatya kaa prayaas karata he tab uski aatma ke hisse ke saath sarpbhasha main bolne kii kala harry main bhi chali jaati he
 When he dies in Harry, part of the soul, this power dissipates in Harry
 chathe bhaag main puraani kahani dekhne ke dauraan voldemort ne dambaldor ke saamne ek naukari ke saakshaatkaar ke dauraan daawa kiya ki usne "jaadu kii simaayen pehle se adhik badha di hai"
 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort's magical knowledge is far greater than any living sorcerer, and that even with Voldemort's return to full power, Dumbledore's knowledge of having the most powerful defense spells in front of his spells would be insufficient

 Despite such an auspicious start to his career, Shearer slowly went into the team and did not score a goal in the next season of the club
 Throughout his career, Shearer's strength has been his identity, allowing him to keep the ball in Southampton and give his team opportunities

 Although Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was also interested, Blackburn mentor Jack Walker had enough to separate the million striker from the Saints and in the summer of 1992, Shearer moved to Ewood Park in the north

 However, Blackburn Rovers owner Jack Walker refused to sell it to Manchester United
 On 30 July 1996, Shearer was inspired to return to Newcastle by a record-breaking £ 15 million world transfer bid from his hometown club and league runner-up Newcastle United, organized by Shearer's hero Kevin Keegan

 Another injury problem, Shearer was unable to score more than just two goals in 17 games in the 1997–98 season due to an injury to the ankle ligament in a pre-season match at Goodison Park
 His injury was reflected in the club's position and Newcastle finished just 13th in the league
 Although United did well in the FA Cup, Shearer led the team to the final by winning the decisive goal over Sheffield United in the semi-finals
 At Wembley, the team was unable to place on the points table and lost 2–0 to Arsenal

 The game referee did not take any action against Shearer and the AF was acquitted of all charges when Lennon testified in favor of the player
 Graham Kelly, a former head of the Football Association who made allegations against the player, later claimed in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to leave the 1998 World Cup when he was charged, a claim strongly denied by Shearer

 He helped Newcastle make it to the FA Cup finals for the second time in a row and the following season's UEFA Cup but lost once again, this time to a 2–0 treble-chasing Manchester United
 The 1999–2000 season faded due to managerial changes, with 66-year-old Bobby Robson replacing him as unpopular Rud Gleit resigned
 Due to the dismissal of the former, he decided to leave Shearer in the starting lineup at 2–1 from his rival club Sunderland

 Although 2001-02 was better; Shearer scored 23 goals in 37 league games and Newcastle finished fourth — their highest since 1997 — meaning they would be able to compete in the Champions League competition next season
 One of the memorable events of the season was that Roy Keane was sent out following a clash with Shearer during a 4-3 Newcastle win over the Red Devils in September 2001

 Announcing that this would be his final season before retirement, Shearer's condition was not as good in 2004–05, with new member Patrick Clovert scoring only seven goals in 28 games and finishing 14th in the season
 The club fared better in the cup competitions, however, eventually losing to Sporting in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup and Manchester United in the semi-finals of the FA Cup

 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice that proclaims that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages such as 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow them, allowing each person to attain the Hayat and finally the success

 Was established In 630 AD, Muhammad Sah with his followers marched on Mecca, the people of Mecca were defeated in the war and Mecca came under the control of the Muslims
 Kaaba Sharif was declared a holy place of Islam
 In later years, Muhammad underwent several social and religious reforms, uniting the various Arab tribes under Islam
 Hazrat died in 632 AD, but by then almost all tribes of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam

 As a child, he was called by two names, his mother called him Muhammad and grandfather Abdul Muttalib called him Ahmed
 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance
 One of them is the following: "ootiyat ummuhu fil manaami faki-l laha annaki ha-m-lat sayyidal aalami-na va kheral variyati fa-sammihu mohammadan ija va-ja-atahu satu hmdu biha0" Muhammad was orphaned at a young age
 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness

 vastunishthawad, positivism kaa hindikaran he
 Positivism, derived from the French word "positif", is used in the sense of "fixed", unambiguous "and" asserted
 yah anubhavathit tatv vaigyanik atakalon tathaa purv dharanaon kaa parityag kar anubhavpradatton tak simit rah sabhi anubhavvaadi darshanon par lagu hota he
 Kant had chosen this term for a system of thought and life that considers knowledge based only on discoveries and methods of real physical phenomena, but "objectivism", used in different contexts, is useful, relative, and normative in addition to reality, fixed and pure
 And also became sympathetic
 yadhyapi vyavasthit gyaan kii uplabdhi main vaigyanik vidhiyon kaa prayog babilonia, misr tathaa greece main pracheen kaal main tathaa kopernicus, kepler, galileo, bekan or dekart dwaara aadhunik kaal main bhi ho chukaa he, tathaapi saamanyatya "vastunishthawad" kont ke darshan ke liye hi prayukt hota he jo atindriya nirpeksh satta ke gyaan ke samaksh vaigyanik gyaan kii adhik upyogita sweekaar karata he, kyonki vah prakritik shaktiyon ko adhikrut kar manvonnati main yoga detaa he
 According to Kant, in addition to scientific methods, it is also necessary to adopt a scientific approach so that moral and social trade of life can be arranged and sorted just like physical events
 hum kii bhanti atindriya pariklpanaaon kaa parityag kar vastu nishthawad sanshaywaadee athwa agyeyavaadee nishedhaatmak darshan nahin apanaataa varan nishchit rup se siddh karata he ki samvednon ke atirikt anubhav main vaigyanik niyam praapt hote hai jo prakruti kii ekarupata kii atindriya pariklpana par aadhaarit hone se keval sambhavya hai parantu aprapt nirpeksh se utkrisht hai
 Kont has attempted to interpret the objective philosophy through the fundamental rules of the three stages of cultural development in "objectivist philosophy"
 dharmik, darshanik tathaa nishchit jaisi teen avasthaaon main se pratham antim kaarnon kii khoj main ishwar par pahunchati he; duusari, adrusht shaktiyon ke chintan main prakruti par tikti he; tathaa tritiy nishchit niyamon kii khoj kar saamaanya niyam praapt karti he
 The various stages represent the infancy, adolescent and adult stages of mankind
 manushya maatr kaa saanskrithik vikaas maanavikaran kii praarambhik pravriti se prarambh hokar darshanik niyamon kii pratishtha ke madhya hokar vastunishthavadi str par pahunchataa he
 As a reaction to traditional philosophies, substantial promotion of Objectivism took place, especially in South America
 sanyukt rajya main vyavahaarwad, navy vastuwaad, aalochanatmak vastuwaad tathaa jadwaad ke prachlan se vastunishthawad kaa keval ek vishesh rup "taarkik anubhavvaad" punap sakaa jo kont kaa drushtikon apanaae hue he
 Logical Objectivism is a bizarre combination of Hume's empiricism, Kant's objectivism, and Whitehead Russell's logical analysis
 vigyaanon ko niraapad adharapradaan tathaa atindriya tatvvigyaan kii nirarthakta ke yugal uddeshyon kii purti ke hetu vah bhashaa ke taarkik vishleshan kii vidhi apanaataa he jisase yah paramparaagat manovaigyanik vishleshan kaa parityag kar detaa he
 By considering the process of verification as the meaning of a preamble, the logical objectivists consider the traditional philosophical questions as meaningless because they do not have any meaning according to this new interpretation as being related to the latent subjects
 udgaman ko "kaary karne kaa niyam" tathaa vaigyanik niyamon ko "ekvachaneey prastaavnaon kii yojanaayen" maanakar taarkik anubhavvaadi vigyaan kaa vah sangat chitra prastut karata he jiske anusaar tatvavaigyanik pariklpanaayen purnataya bahishkrut hai
 But there will be a complete lack of objectivity in science based on the experience of the person
 is vastunishthawad main is prakaar nishchit nirpeksh tathaa vastugat kuch bhi nahin rah jaataa
 This constructive synthesis of opposing tendencies like empiricism and rational rationalism refuses its own theory in the sense of meaning

 Wound healing or wound repair is a complex process by which the skin repairs itself after injury
 saamaanya twachaa main, uparkala or antarkala ek sthir-dasha ke santulan main rahati he or bahya vaataavaran ke viruddh ek rakshaatmak avrodh banaae rakhti he
 The normal process of healing begins immediately after the defensive barrier breaks
 jakhm kii marammat kaa adarsh pratimaan teen yaa chaar kramik, kintu ativyapee avasthaaon main vibhajit kiya gaya he: raktasravastambhan, shoth, prafalan or purnirmaan
 twachaa par chot lagane par, jakhm kii marammat ke liye baariki se sanchalit prapaat ke rup main ek jatil jaevrasynic ghatnakram hota he
 Within minutes after injury, clotting cells accumulate in place of the wound to form a fibrin clot
 yah thakka sakriy raktasrav ko rokane kaa kaary karata he
 In the inflammatory phase, bacteria and residues are devoured by the euthanasia cells, and factors are released that cause the cells in the proliferative state to migrate and divide
 prafalan avasthaa main raktavahikanirmaan, colejan bhandaaran, kanankur oottakon kaa nirmaan, upatvchikaran or ghaav kaa sankuchan hota he
 New blood vessels are formed by vascular endothelial cells in blood vessel formation
 tantuvikson or kanankur oottak ke nirmaan main, tantu koshikaayen utpann hoti hai or colejan tathaa fibronactin kaa srav karke nai, kaaryakari bahyakoshikeey aadhatri ) kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Also, the epithelium is regenerated, in which epithelial cells proliferate and provide a covering for the new tissue by 'crawling' over the wound
 sankuchan main, ghaav ko peshitantu koshikaon kii kriya dwaara aakaar main or chota kiya jaataa he, jo ghaav ke siron par ek pakad paidaa karti hai tathaa chikani peshi koshikaon ke jaisi ek prakriya kaa prayog karke swayan ko sankuchit karti hai
 When these cells fulfill their role, the redundant cells are autoimmunized
 paripakvan or purnirmaan avasthaa main, colejan tanaav rekhaon ke saath-saath purnirmit or purnvyavasthit hota he tathaa jin koshikaon kii jarurat nahin hoti unhen swatah koshikamrityu dwaara hataa diya jaataa he
 However, this process is not only complex, but also brittle, and is likely to deviate or fail, causing long-term canker sores
 isamen madad karne vaale karkon main madhumeh, shira yaa dhamni rog, budhapa or sankraman shaamil hai
 As noted above, repair of wounds is ideally divided into hemorrhage, inflammatory, proliferative and remodeling stages
 ek upyogi rachana hone par bhi, yah pratimaan vyaktigat avasthaaon main kaaphi ativyapaktaa kaa prayog karata he
 Recently a complementary model has been described, in which several elements of wound repair are more clearly presented
 is nae pratimaan kaa mahatv purnirmaan chikitsa or oottak ejineering ke kshetron main iske upyog se or bhi adhik parilakshith ho jaataa he
 In this structure, the healing process of wound is divided into two main stages: initial state and cellular state: praarambhik avasthaa main, jo twachaa ko lagane ke turant baad shuru ho jaati he, prapaateey anvik or koshikeey ghatnaayen hoti hai jinase raktasravastambhan ho jaataa he or ek sheeghra, kaamchalaoo bahyakoshikeey aadhatri kaa nirmaan hota he— jo koshikeey sanlagan or uske baad ke koshikeey prafalan liye rachanaatmak aadhaar uplabdh karata he
 The initial stage is followed by the cellular state, in which a number of cells work together to initiate the inflammatory response, synthesize granulatory tissue and restore epithelial layer
 koshikeey avasthaa ke upavibhag hai – mahabhakshak or shothajnya ansh, upartvachiya- messenkimal antarkriya – purnaupartvachikaran, tantukoshikaayen or peshitantukoshikaayen - vikasaatmak vyavastha, colejan utpaadan or aadhaatri sankuchan, antarkaleey koshikaayen or raktavahikanirmaan, twajeey aadhaatri – nirmaan or parivartan ke tatv
 Just before the onset of the inflammatory phase, clotting falls to achieve bleeding block or to stop hemorrhage or bleeding via fibrin clots
 uske baad, vibhinn ghulansheel kaarak mukt kiye jate hai jo aisi koshikaon ko aakarshith karte hai jo, ghaav kii marammat kii prafalan avasthaa ko shuru karne vaale anuon ko mukt karne ke alaava kachare, jeevanuon or kshatigrast utakon kaa bhakshan bhi karti hai
 When the tissue is first injured, the blood comes in contact with collagen, which causes blood clot cells to start secreting inflammatory agents
 thakka koshikaayen un koshika jhilliyon par glycoproteinon kaa srav bhi karti hai jo unhen ek duusare se chipak kar or ekatrit hokar ek pind banane main madad karte hai
 Fibrin and fibronectin intermingle to form a stopper that prevents proteins and particles from getting trapped and causing blood loss
 yah daat fibrin-fibronactin colejan ke jamaa hone tak ghaav ke liye mukhya rachanaatmak aadhaar kaa kaam karata he
 The migrating cells use this stopper as a motif to crawl forward and the clots secrete factors by sticking to it
 thakka antat vighatit ho jaataa he or uskaa sthaan kanankur oottak or baad main colejan le letaa he
 Shortly after wounding, the most present cells, clot cells secrete cytokines, including many items and growth factors, including ECM proteins in the blood
 vikaas kaarak koshikaon ko uttejit karke unke vibhaajan kii dar ko badhaate hai
 Clot cells also secrete other inflammatory factors such as serotonin, bradykinin, prostaglandins, prostacyclins, thromboxane and histamine, which serve several purposes including increased cell proliferation and migration in that area and widening of blood vessels to become spongy
 Is included
 rakt vahika ke fatne ke turant baad, fatty hui koshika jhilliyaan thrambaxenon or prastaglandinon jaise shothakaarak karkon kaa srav karti hai, jo vahika kaa sankuchan karke raktahani se bachaav or us sthaan main shothakaari koshikaon or karkon kaa jamaav karte hai
 This vasoconstriction lasts for five to ten minutes, followed by vasoconstriction, which reaches the apex 20 minutes after injury
 vahikaprasaran thakka koshikaon or anya koshikaon dwaara nirgamit karkon kaa parinaam hota he
 The main factor involved in vasodilation is histamine
 histamine raktavahikaaon ko chhidramay bhi banaata he, jisase oottak sooj jaataa he kyonki raktapravaah se protein nikalakar bahyawahika sthaan main chale jate hai, jo uske osmolar bhaar ko badha detaa he tathaa us kshetra main pani ko avashoshit kar letaa he
 Increased permeability of blood vessels helps inflammatory cells such as leukocytes enter the wound from the bloodstream
 jakhmi hone ke ek ghante ke bheetar, bahurupanabhikeey neutrophil ) ghaav-sthal par pahunch jate hai or chot lagane ke baad ke pehle do dinon main ghaav kii mukhya koshikaon kaa rup dhaaran kar lete hai, khaskar duusare din ve badi sankhya main hote hai
 They are attracted to the site by substances such as fibronectin, growth factors, and kinin
 neutrophil kachare or jeevanuon kaa bhakshan karte hai or 'shwasan visphot' dwaara mukt kanon kaa nirgam karke jeevanuon kaa naash bhi karte hai
 They also secrete proteases that disinfect the damaged tissue and also cleanse the wound
 neutrophil kii apane kaaryon ko puraa karne ke baad saadharantaya swatah koshikamrityu ho jaati he or unka mahabhakshakon dwaara bhakshan or avakraman kar diya jaataa he
 Other leukocytes that enter the region include helper t cells, which secrete cytokines and increase t cell division and inflammation and increase vasodilation and vasculature
 tii koshikaayen mahabhakshakon kii gatividhi main bhi vruddhi karti hai
 General practitioners are essential for wound healing
 chot lagane ke do dinon ke bheetar ve ghaav main pramukh koshikaon ke rup main piemen kaa sthaan le lete hai
 Monocytes from the bloodstream enter the area through blood vessels, attracted by the growth factors released by clot cells and other cells towards the wound site
 ghaav main maujuud monociton kii sankhya chot lagane ke ek se dedh dinon main apane sheersh tak pahunch jaati he
 Once reaching the wound site, monocytes mature and turn into macrophages
 tilli main sharir ke samast monociton kii aadhi maatra jakhmi oottak par prayog ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahati he
 The main role of the macrophage is to eat bacteria and damaged tissue, and they also release the damaged tissue by releasing proteases
 mahabhakshak vikaas karkon or anya cytocinon jaise kai karkon kaa srav bhi karte hai, visheshkar ghaav hone ke baad chauthe or paanchave dinon main
 ye kaarak marammat kii prafalan avasthaa main bhaag lene vaali koshikaon ko us kshetra kii ore aakarshith karte hai, haalanki sankuchit avasthaa main ve un par ankush laga sakate hai
 The macrophages are stimulated to produce factors that stimulate and accelerate angiogenesis by decreasing the amount of oxygen around them, and they also stimulate cells that regenerate the wound, and granulation Tissues and new extracellular membranes form
 in karkon kaa srav karke mahabhakshak ghaav kii marammat kii prakriya ko agle charan main le jane main yogadan karte hai
 As edema ends, the secretion of inflammatory factors begins to decrease, the pre-existing factor is disintegrated, and the number of neutrophils and macrophages at the wound site decreases
 ye parivartan sanket dete hai ki shothakaari avasthaa samaapt ho rahi he or prafalan avasthaa shuru hone vaali he
 According to evidence obtained outside the body using the same skin pattern, the presence of macrophages may actually slow down the contraction of the wound, and therefore the disappearance of the macrophages from the wound may be necessary for further conditions to occur
 chunki shothakriya sankraman se ladane, kachare ko hataane or prafalan avasthaa ko prerit karne main bhoomikaayen nibhaati he, yah ghaav ke sookhne kaa aavashyak hissaa he
 However, staying on too long can damage tissue due to inflammation
 is tarah upachaar ke pariprekshya main shoth main kami laana kai baar ek lakshya hota he
 Inflammation lasts as long as the residue is present in the wound
 isaliye gandagi yaa anya vastuon kii maujuudagi shothakaari avasthaa ko bahut samay tak badha sakati he, jisase ghaav purana ho jaataa he
 Two or three days after the wound occurs, fibroblasts begin to enter the wound site, triggering the proliferative stage before the inflammatory phase ends
 ghaav kii marammat kii anya avasthaaon kii tarah, prafalan avasthaa ke charan kisi shrankhla main na hokar samay main aanshik rup se ativyapee hote hai
 The process of angiogenesis, also called neovascularization, occurs simultaneously with proliferation of fibroblasts when endothelial cells migrate to the wound area
 chunki tantukoshikaon or upartvachiya koshikaon ko oxygen or poshakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, isaliye ghaav kii marammat kii anya avasthaaon, jaise upartvachiya va tantukoshikaon ke pravaas ke liye raktavahikanirmaan aavashyak he
 The tissue that has hemangioma appears red due to the presence of capillaries
 akshatigrast rakt vahikaaon ke bhaagon se nikalne vaali antarkaleey koshikaon kii stem koshikaon main nakli koshika prakshepan utpann ho jate hai or isiem main se ghaav-sthal main ghuskar nai rakt vahikaaon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Endothelial cells are attracted to the wound area by fibronectin found on the fibrin scab and chemical touch by angiogenic factors released by other cells, e
g
 By macrophages and clots in a low-oxygen environment
 Endothelial growth and proliferation are also directly stimulated by the lack of oxygen and the presence of lactic acid in the wound
 pravaas karne ke liye, antarkaleey koshikaon ko thakke or isiem ke bhaag ko avakramit karne ke liye colejan or plasminogen uttejk kii jarurat padati he
 Zinc-dependent metalloproteinase digests the basement membrane and ECM to allow cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis
 jab mahabhakshak or anya vikaas kaarak-utpaadak koshikaayen kam oxygen vaale, lactic amla bhare vaataavaran se baahar nikal aati hai, to ve vahikajanak karkon kaa utpaadan band kar detii hai
 Thus, when the tissue has sufficient blood flow, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells is reduced
 antatogatva, jin raktavahikaaon kii ab jarurat nahin hoti he, ve swatahkoshikamrityu dwaara mar jaati hai
 At the same time as angiogenesis, fibroblasts begin to collect at the wound site
 tantu koshikaayen ghavsthal main ghaav hone ke do se paanch dinon baad, jab shothakaari avasthaa samaapt ho rahi hoti he, pravesh karnaa shuru karti hai or unki sankhya ghaav hone ke ek se do hafton baad sheersh par pahunchati he
 By the end of the first week, fibroblasts are the main cells in the wound
 tantuvikson ghaav hone ke do se chaar hafton ke baad samaapt hota he
 In the first two or three days after injury, fibroblasts migrate and proliferate predominantly, while later, they are the main cells forming collagen ganglion in the wound site
 in tantukoshikaon kii utpatti paas kii akshatigrast twachaa oottak se hui maani jaati he 
 Initially fibroblasts use fibrin-cross-linked fibers to migrate into the wound and then attach to fibronectin
 tantukoshikaayen phir ghaav kii shayya main mukhya-padaarth or baad main colejan, jamaa karti hai, jisase ve pravaas ke liye chipak sakati hai
 The granulation tissue acts as an undeveloped tissue and, two to five days after the wound, begins to appear only when the wound is in an inflammatory state and develops until the wound bed is healed
 kanankur oottak main nai raktavahikaayen, tantukoshikaayen, shothakaari koshikaayen, antarkaleey koshikaayen, peshitantukoshikaayen or nai kaaryakari bahyakoshikeey aadhaatri ke ansh hote hai
 The executive ECM differs from the normal tissue ECM in structure and its components are produced in fibroblasts
 in anshon main fibronactin, colejan, glicominoglaicon, elestin, glycoprotein or proteyoglaycon shaamil hai
 Its main components are fibronectin and hyaluronan, which form an extremely watery moiety and help in cell migration
 baad main yah kaaryakari aadhaatri ek aisi isiem dwaara visthapit ho jaati he, jo akshatigrast oottak main pai jane vaali isiem se bahut milti-julati hoti he
 Growth factor, tgf-beta) and fibronectin stimulate proliferation, migration and production of ECM molecules by fibroblasts to the wound bed
 tantukoshikaayen upartvachiya koshikaon ko ghaav-sthal kii ore aakarshith karne vaale vikaas karkon kaa srav bhi karti hai
 Oxygen deficiency also participates in proliferation of fibroblasts and exit of growth factors, however, a severe lack of oxygen can produce excessive, fibrous spots by inhibiting their growth and deposition of ECM fractions
 tantukoshikaon ke sabase mahatvapurn kaaryon main se ek colejan kaa utpaadan karnaa hota he
 Collagen deposition is necessary because it increases the strength of the wound — the only thing that keeps the wound closed before it is formed is the fibrin – fibronectin clot, which does not provide much resistance to the injury resulting from the injury
 Also, cells involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and connective tissue formation attach, grow and differentiate on the collagen matrix produced by fibroblasts
 tip 3 colejan or fibronactin kaa acchhee maatra main utpaadan, mukhyatah ghaav ke aakaar ke anusaar, saadharantaya lagbhag 10 ghanton se 3 dinon ke bich hone lagata he
 Their deposits reach the top in one to three weeks
 paripakvata kii avasthaa ke ant tak ve pramukh tanansheel padaarth hote hai, jis samay unhen adhik majboot tip 1 colejan dwaara visthapit kar diya jaataa he
 At the same time fibroblasts are producing new collagen, collagenase and other factors also degrade it
 jakhm hone ke thodi der baad, avakraman kii tulana main sanshleshan adhik hota he, jisase ghaav main colejan ke str bad jate hai, lekin baad main utpaadan or avakraman samaan ho jate hai jisase colejan main kul laabh shunya rah jaataa he
 This symmetry indicates the onset of the later maturation phase
 kanankuran dhire se samaapt ho jaataa he or tantukoshikaayen kaa sankhya ghaav main ek baar unka kaary samaapt ho jane par kam hone lagati he
 At the end of the granulation phase, fibroblasts begin to self-purify, causing the granulatory tissue to reach an environment predominantly collagen-rich from tissue cells
 khule jakhm main kanankur oottak kaa nirmaan purnaupartvachikaran avasthaa ke hone main sahaayak hota he, jisase upartvachiya koshikaayen nae oottak main pravaas karke ghaav va vaataavaran ke bich ek baandh kaa nirmaan karti hai
 The basic keratin cells of wound ends and skin contractures such as hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands are the main cells responsible for the epithelialization stage of wound repair
 ve ghaav-sthal par ek parat ke rup main failati hai or uske siron par prafalit hoti hai tathaa tabhi ruukti hai jab bich main unka mail hota he
 Keratinocytes migrate without proliferating first
 pravaas jakhmi hone ke kuch hi ghanton main shuru ho saktaa he
 However, epithelial cells require living tissue to migrate, so if the wound is deep, it must first be filled with granulation tissue
 is tarah se pravaas ke prarambh kaa samay bhinn ho saktaa he or jakhmi hone ke lagbhag ek din baad ho saktaa he
 The cells at the ends of the wound may proliferate on the second and third day after wounding, so that more cells are available for migration
 yadi taleey jhilli main vyavdhaan na hua ho, to upartvachiya koshikaayen teen dinon ke bheetar aadharbhoot part main koshikaon ke vibhaajan or upar kii ore pravaas dwaara usee tarah se visthapit ho jaati hai jaise akshatigrast twachaa main hota he
 But if the basement membrane is destroyed at the wound site, then reabsorption is required from the ends of the wound and skin contracts such as hair follicles and sweat and oil glands, which enter the skin adorned with living keratinocytes
 yadi ghaav bahut gaharaa hua to twachaa ke anubandh bhi nasht ho sakate hai or tab pravaas keval ghaav ke siron se hi ho saktaa he
 Migration of keratinocytes to the wound site is stimulated by lack of contact-inhibition and by chemicals such as nitric oxide
 pravaas karne ke pehle, koshikaon ko apane desmosome or hemidesmosome kaa vighatan karnaa padataa he, jo saamanyatya koshikaon ko madhyamik tantuon dwaara unke koshikapanjar main anya koshikaon or isiem se baandhe rakhte hai
 The paracrine receptor protein called integrin, which is made up of glycoproteins and normally binds the cell to the planar membrane by its cytoplasm, is released by the secondary fibers of the cell, and the ECM is released to the simulated cell surface by displacing actin fibers during migration
 Let's use it like an attachment
 is tarah kerratinkoshikaayen taleey jhilli se alag ho jaati hai or ghaav kii shaiyya main pravesh karne main sakasham ho paati hai
 Before migrating, keratinocytes change their shape and grow long and flat to produce cellular enlargements such as lamellipodia and wide enlargements that resemble frills
 actin tantu or naklikoshika bhi ban jate hai
 At the time of migration, the integrin of the mock cells attaches to the ECM and the actin fibers of the proliferation pull the cell together
 integrin ke jariye isiem main anuon kii antarkriya actin tantuon, lamelepedia or filopodia ke nirmaan ko or badhaati he
 Epithelial cells climb over each other to migrate
 upartvachiya koshikaon kii is badhati hui parat ko akasar upartvachiya jihva kaa naam diya jaataa he
 The first cells to connect to the planar membrane form the base layer
 ye aadharbhoot koshikaayen ghaav-shaiyya ke upar pravaas karti rahati hai or unke upar kii upartvachiya koshikaayen bhi unke saath hi sarakati jaati hai
 The sooner this migration occurs, the smaller the bruise
 isiem main fibrin, colejan or fibronactin aage koshikaon ko vibhajit hone or pravaas karne kaa sanket de sakate hai
 Like fibroblasts, migrating keratinocytes use fibronectin cross-linked with fibrin that has accumulated at the time of inflammation as a site for crawling
 jaise-jaise kerratinkoshikaayen pravaas karti hai, ve kanankur oottak se, lekin papadi ke neeche se badhati hai or use neeche sthit oottak se alag karti hai
 Epithelial cells have the ability to feed waste materials such as dead tissue and bacterial substances, which might otherwise block their passage
 chunki unhen nirmit ho rahi kisi bhi papadi ko ghol dena hota he, isaliye kerretinokoshikaon kaa pravaas nam vaataavaran dwaara sabase acchhee tarah se badhaayaa jaataa he, kyonki shushk vaataavaran main adhik badi or sakht papadi banati he
 To make its way into the tissue, it is necessary to decompose clots, wastes and parts of the ECM by keratinocytes
 ve plasminogen-utprerak kaa srav karti hai, jo plasminogen ko sakriy karata he or use papadi ko gholne ke liye plazmin main badalata he
 Cells can only migrate to living tissue, so it is necessary to exclude proteases such as collagenases and half-metalloproteinases to eliminate damaged parts of the ECM en route, especially in front of the migratory layer
 Keratinocytes also dissolve the planar membrane and instead use a new ECM created by fibroblasts to crawl and grow
 jaise-jaise kerratinkoshikaayen pravaas jari rakhti hai, unke sthaan par ghaav ke siron par nai upartvachiya koshikaon kaa bananaa aavashyak hota he, jisase aage badhati parat ke liye or adhik koshikaayen uplabdh hoti hai
 The proliferation behind the migrating keratinocytes usually begins a few days after injury and its rate is 17 times higher in this stage of epithelialization than in normal tissues
 saare jakhmi bhaag ke waapas banane tak prafalit hone vaali upartvachiya koshikaayen keval ghaav ke siron par hoti hai
 Growth factors stimulated by integrins and mmps encourage cells to proliferate at the ends of the wound
 swayan kerratinkoshikaayen bhi vikaas karkon or taleey jhilli proteinon sahit karkon kaa utpaadan or srav karti hai, jo upartvachikaran or jakhm kii marammat kii anya avasthaaon main madad karte hai
 Growth factors are also important for intrinsic immune defense of skin lesions by promoting the production of antitussin peptides and neutrophil chemotactic cytokines in keratinocytes
 kerratinkoshikaayen ghaav kii shaiyya par se tab tak pravaas jari rakhti hai, jab tak ki donon ore kii koshikaayen madhya main mil na jaaen, jis samay sampark dwaara avrodh unhen pravaas karne se roak detaa he
 When they stop migration, keratinocytes secrete proteins that form new planar membranes
 pravaas shuru karne ke liye dhaaran rup ke parivartanon ko koshikaayen ulataa kar detii hai –ve punah desmosome or hemidesmosome dhaaran kar leti hai or phir ek baar taleey jhilli se jud jaati hai
 The basal cells begin to divide and differentiate in the same manner as they do in normal skin to restore the layers found in the re-dermal skin
 sankuchan ghaav kii marammat kii mukhya avasthaa hoti he
 If contractions occur for too long, they may cause deformity and loss of function
 isaliye ghaav ke sankuchan ke jeevigyaan ko samajhane main kaaphi ruchi dikhaai gayi he, jise sharir ke baahar colejan jail sankuchan jaanch yaa twajeey samaan pratimaan kaa prayog karke pratimanit kiya ja saktaa he
 The contraction begins about a week after wounding, when fibroblasts develop into myofibroblasts, contraction in full-thickness seedlings reaches their apex 5 to 15 days after wounding
 sankuchan kai saptahon tak hota rah saktaa he or ghaav ke puri tarah se purnaupartvachikaran hone ke baad bhi jari rah saktaa he
 a large wound can be 40 to 80 percent smaller after contraction
 jakhmi bhaag main oottak ke deelepan ke anusaar ghaav 0
75 mimi pratidin kii gati tak se sankuchit ho sakate hai
 The contraction does not usually occur in a symmetrical way - most lesions have an axis of contraction, which allows cells to have better organization and convention with collagen
 pehle, sankuchan peshitantukoshikaon ke bina hota he
 Later fibroblasts stimulated by growth factors turn into myofibroblasts
 peshitantukoshikaayen jo chikani peshi koshikaon ke samaan hoti hai, sankuchan ke liye jimmedaar hoti hai
 Myofibroblasts have the same type of actin as that found in smooth muscle cells
 peshitantukoshikaayen fibronactin or vikaas karkon dwaara aakarshith hokar ghaav ke siron tak pahunchane ke liye asthaayee isiem main fibrin se jude fibronactin ke sahare aage badhati hai
 They make contact with the ECM at the ends of the wound and connect to each other and to the ends of the wound by desmosomes
 saath hi, fibronexs naamak ek avlamb par peshitantukoshika kaa actin koshika jhilli ke paar bahyakoshika aadhaatri ke anuon jaise fibronactin or colejan se jud jaataa he
 Myofibroblasts may have multiple supports that allow them to stretch to the ECM during contraction, reducing the lesion size
 sankuchan ke is bhaag main, gaiyrpeshitantukoshika vaale pehle bhaag kii apeksha adhik teji se ghaav band hota he
 As the actin in myofibroblasts narrows, the wound ends are pulled
 peshitantukoshikaon ke sankuchan ke saath, ghaav ko majboot banane ke liye tantukoshikaayen colejan bichaati jaati hai
 The stage of contraction in proliferation ends with the myocardial cells closing the contraction and autoimmunicating
 asthaayee aadhaatri ke vighatan se hayaluronic acid main kami or kandrytin sulphate main vruddhi hoti he, jo dheer-dhire tantukoshikaon ke pravaas or prafalan ko roak detaa he
 These events are indicative of the maturation stage of wound healing
 jab colejan utpaadan or avakraman ke str samaan ho jate hai, tab oottak kii marammat kii paripakvan dasha kaa prarambh ho janaa mana jaataa he
 At maturation, type 3 collagen, which takes prominence at proliferation, gradually degrades and is replaced by more robust type 1 collagen
 mul rup se visanghatit colejan tantu purnvyavasthit or paar-sanyojit hokar tanaav rekhaon ke saath-saath jamaa diye jate he
 The onset of the maturation phase can vary greatly depending on the size of the wound and whether it is initially closed or left open, and may occur in about 3 days to 3 weeks
 isi tarah, paripakvan avasthaa ghaav ke prakaar ke anusaar ek varsh yaa usase adhik samay tak jari rah sakati he
 As this stage progresses, the tensile strength of the wound increases, which becomes powerful at up to 50 percent of normal tissue strength and eventually up to 80 percent of its strength in the three months following injury
 chunki ghaav-sthal par gatividhi kam ho jaati he, ghaav kaa nishaan apni laalimaa chhod detaa he, kyonki rakt vahikaaon kii ab jarurat na hone ke kaaran unhen swatahkoshikamrityu dwaara hataa liya jaataa he
 Wound repair stages usually occur in predictable, topical ways — if not, the repair may improperly result in long-term wounds such as vein ulcers or pathologic scars, such as a colloid scar
 ek dashak pehle tak, ghaav kii marammat ke adarsh udhaaharan, jisamen avyav-vishisht vanshawaliyon tak simit stem koshikaon kii bhagidaari maani jaati he, ko kabhi gambhirtha se chunauti nahin di gai thi
 Since then, the idea of the ability of adult stem cells to contain cellular flexibility or to develop into non-lineage cells has emerged as an alternative explanation
 adhik spasht rup se kahen to, raktanirmaan prajnak koshikaon main vi-vibhedikaran dwaara raktanirmaan stem koshikaon main waapas badalane or / yaa gaiyr-vanshavali koshikaon, jaise tantukoshikaon, main parivibhedit hone kii kshamta ho sakati he
 Multifunctional adult stem cells have the ability to self-renew and generate different cell types
 stem koshikaayen prajnak koshikaon ko utpann karti hai, jo swatahnavikaran to nahin kar saktin, parantu kai tarah kii koshikaayen utpann kar sakati hai
 The extent of involvement of stem cells in skin wound repair is complex and not fully understood
 yah samajha jaataa he ki uparkala or twachaa sutrivibhaajan rup se sakriy stem koshikaon dawaara purngathit kii jaati hai, jo reti ke ubhaaron ke sheersh par, kesh putikaaon ke ubhaaron par or pravardhi twachaa par nivas karti hai
 In addition, the bone marrow may also contain stem cells that play a major role in the repair of skin lesions
 durlabh paristhitiyon main, jaise twachaa ke vyapak rup se jakhmi hone par, asthi majja kii swatahnavikaran upaabaadiyaan marammat kii prakriya main bhaag lene ke liye prerit kii ja sakati hai, jahaan ve colejan-sravak koshikaon ko utpann karti hai, jo ghaav kii marammat main bhoomika nibhaati lagati hai
 These are two autoimmunity subpopulations, bone marrow-produced mesenchymal stem cells) and blood-forming progenitor cells)
 asthi majja main ek prajnak upaabaadi ) bhi nivas karti he jo samaan paristhiti main rakt vahikaaon kii purnsanrachana main madad ke kaam main laai jaati hai
 Also, it is understood that the extensive injury to the skin also prompts a unique subclass of leukocytes to arrive early, where they perform various functions related to wound repair
 'marammat' or 'purnutpatti' ke bich ek halkaa sa antar hota he
 Interruption in the form and / or functionality of any tissue is called injury
 marammat kaa sambandh chot lagane ke baad khoe gaye yaa kshatigrast oottak ke sampurna purnsthaapan ke bina taratamya purnsthapit karne ke praytn main avyav ke sharirkriyaatmak anukulan se hota he
 Eternal tissue regeneration refers to the restoration of exactly the same copy of a lost or damaged tissue, with both form and functionality completely restored
 stanadhariyon svaichhik purnutpati nahin karte he
 In some situations, such as partial regeneration of the skin, it can be stimulated by the use of biodegradable scaffolds
 ye machaan rachanaatmak rup se saamaanya / gaiyr-jakhmi twachaa main pai jane vaali bahyakoshikeey aadhaatri ) ke sadrush hote hai
 Interestingly, the basic conditions required for tissue regeneration are often against conditions that are suitable for wound repair, including inhibition of activation of the clot, inflammatory response and contraction of the wound
 tantukoshika or antarkaleey koshika ke bandhan ke liye samarthan dene ke alaava, jainasvakramntic machaan ghaav ke sankuchan ko avaruddha karte hai, jisase marammat kii prakriya adhik purnirmaan / kam nishaan vaale pathmarg par agrasar hoti he
 Contribution of the skin and skin without completely penetrating the skin
 Wound repair by the process of healing : The main growth factors involved in wound healing are: Cell death: Necrosis · Apoptosis · Pyknosis · Karyorrhexis · Karyolysis Cellular adaptation: Atrophy · Hypertrophy · Hyperplasia · Dysplasia · Metaplasia saanchaa:wound healing Jampali is a village in Raigad district of Raigarh district in the Raigarh division of India

 2386 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 2386 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar
 adhikansh vishwa main isi paddati ke aadhaar par puraane varshon kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 2386 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he
 Bajrang Dal is the young face of the link between the Sangh Parivar and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 isaki shuruyaat 1 oktober 1984 main sabase pehle bharat ke uttar pradesh praant se hui jiskaa baad main puure bharat main vistaar hua
 Hindutva is the main philosophy of this family
 bajrang dal kaa daawa he ki abhi iske 1,300,000 sadsy hai jinamein 850,000 kaaryakarta shaamil hai
 Like the Sangh runs a branch-like akhada whose number is around two and a half thousand
 bajrang dal kaa suutaravakya "seva, suraksha or samskruti" he
 His chief is Manoj Verma
 hindu yuva shakti ko samaaj ke prati sanskarayukt sakaaratmak bhoomika kii ore prerit karnaa bhi bajrang dal kaa mukhya kaary he l america khufia agency siie ne rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko "rashtravaadi sanghathan" shrenee main rakhaa he evam vishwa hindu parishad or bajrang dal ko dharmik ugravadi sanghathan bataaya he,jiskaa desh bhar main teevr virodh chal rahaa haisiie dwaara jari world fact book main vihip or bajrang dal ko 'raajnneetik dawaab samooh' kii shrenee main shaamil kiya gaya hamel In October 1984, Vishwa Hindu Parishad started regular processions in Ayodhya

 Presently, Manoj Verma of Madhya Pradesh is the national sponsor of Bajrang Dal
 jataka yaa jataka pali yaa jataka kathaayen buddha granth tripitak kaa suttapitak antargat khuddakanikaay kaa 10waan bhaag he
 These stories contain the stories of Mahatma Buddha's earlier births
 jo manyata he ki khud gautamabuddha ji ke dwaara kahe gaye he, haalanki kii kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki kuch jataka kathaayen, gautamabuddha ke nirvana ke baad unke shishyon dwaara kahi gayi he
 The oldest written stories in the world are Jataka tales in which about 600 stories have been collected
 yah isvi samvath se 300 varsh purv kii ghatana he
 These stories attempt to explain policy and religion through entertainment
 jataka khuddak nikaay kaa dasavaan prasiddh granth he
 It would be more appropriate to call Jataka as the book of texts rather than as a text
 uskaa koi-koi kathanak puure granth ke rup main he or kahin-kahin uski kahaniyon kaa rup sankshipt mahakavy-sa he
 The word Jataka is made of mass metal
 iskaa arth he bhoot athwa bhav
 This word is formed by adding the suffix 'kat' to the 'jan' metal
 dhaatu ko bhoot arth main prayukt karte hue jab arth kiya jaataa he to jatbhoot katha evam rup banataa he
 jat-jani-janan-janam meaning is used when used in the Bhava sense
 is tarah ‘jataka’ shabd kaa a rth he, ‘jaat’ arthath janm-sambandhin
 'jataka' is the stories related to the pre-birth of Lord Buddha
 buddhatv praapt kar lene kii avasthaa se purv bhagavan buddha bodhisattva kehalaate hai
 They are candidates for enlightenment at that time and practice the ten perfections or perfections of charity, piety, friendship, truth, etc
 bhoot-dayaa ke liye ve apane praanon kaa anek baar balidaan karte hai
 In this way, they perform the ability of intelligence
 bodhisattva shabd kaa arth hi he bodhi ke liye udyogshil praani
 For Bodhi, Sattva, which is also said by some scholars
 pali sutton main ham anek baar padhate hai, ‘‘sambodhi praapt hone se pehle, buddha na hone ke samay, jab main bodhisattva hi tha‘‘ aadi
 Therefore, the bodhisattva clearly means the seeker practicing knowledge, true mercy etc
 who is sure to become Buddha later
 bhagwaan buddha bhi na keval apane antim janm main buddhatv-prapti kii avasthaa se purv bodhisattva rahe the, balki apane anek purv janmon main bhi bodhisattva kii charya kaa unhone paalan kiya tha
 The stories of the Jataka are related to these various previous births of Lord Buddha while he was a Bodhisattva
 adhiktar kahaniyon main ve pradhan paatr ke rup main chitrit he
 He himself is the protagonist of the story
 kahin-kahin unka sthaan ek saadhaaran paatr ke rup main gaun he or kahin-kahin ve ek darshak ke rup main bhi chitrit kiye gayi hai
 Often the beginning of each story goes like this: "once upon a time when King Brahmadatta ruled in Varanasi, the Bodhisattvas originated from the vagina of the Kurang deer or 


 the clans of the horses of the Indus cross or the xxrep 5 
 Bodhisattva Brahmadatta's amatya or 

 Bodhisattva was born in the vagina of Goh, etc
 jataka kii kahaniyon main se kuch kaa namakaran to jataka main ai hui gaatha ke pehle shabdon se hua he, yatha-apashnak jataka; kisi kaa pradhan paatr ke anusaar, yatha vannupath jataka; kisi kaa un janmon ke anusaar jo bodhisattva ne grahan kiye yatha, nigredh mig jataka, machh jataka, aadi
 All Jataka stories have been told by Gautam Buddha, Jataka Buddha is time-bound, it is very difficult to decide what is the exact number of people
 lanka, burma or siam main prachlit parampara ke anusaar jataka 550 hai
 Samanatpasadika's Nidan Katha also mentions the same number of natives
 ‘‘pannasa dhakani panchastani jatkanti veditbban
 "in the diagnosis story of Atthasalini also - Pannasadhikani Panchajatakasatani"
 sankhya mote taur par hi nishchit kii gai he
 In the present form of Jataka there are 547 Jataka stories
 par yah sankhya bhi keval upree he
 The Jatakattavanakarika has divided them into five sections in terms of content - jataka kii kai kahaniyaan alp roopaantar ke saath do jagah bhi pai jaati he yaa ek duusare main samavisht bhi kar di gai hai, or isi prakaar kai jataka kathaayen sutt-pitak, vinay-pitak, tathaa anya pali granthon main to pai jaati he, kintu jataka ke vartmaan rup main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, there is also a possibility of a significant decrease in the number of natives and an increase
 udhaahrantah munik jataka or saluk jataka kii kathavstu ek hi si he, kintu keval bhinn-bhinn naamon se vah do jagah ai he
 In contrast, there are two different names, named 'munik Jataka'
 yahi baat machh jataka naam se do jataka kii bhi he
 Somewhere, two independent Jatakas have been merged and a third Jatak has been created
 udhaaharan ke liye panchapandit jataka or dakarkkhas jataka ye donon jataka mahoumagg jataka main antarbhavit hai
 The stories which are found elsewhere in the form of jataka-katha, but are not stored in 'jataka', it will also be necessary to mention something
 majjhim nikaay kaa ghatikaar- sutt yaa ghatikaar sutt ek aisi hi jataka kahani he, jo ‘jataka’ main nahin milti
 Similarly, the Mahagovind Sutta of longevity which has been specified by the name of 'mahagovind Jataka' in the Jataka story of the Jataka itself, is not found inside the Jataka
 isi prakaar dhammapadatthkatha or milind panh main bhi kuch aisi jataka-kathaayen uddhrut kii gai hai, jo jataka main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, some people definitely cannot decide exactly how many are there
 jab jaatakon kii sankhya ke sambandh main vichaar karte hai to jataka se hamaara taatpary ek vishesh sheershak vaali kahani se hota he, jisamen bodhisattva ke jivan-sambandhi ki si ghatana kaa varnan ho, phir chaahe us ek jataka main kitni hi avaantar kathaayen kyon na goonth di gai hon
 If the total stories are counted then about three thousand stories are found in the native
 vastav main jaatakon kaa sankalan sutt-pitak or vinay-pitak ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 There are many such stories in Sutta-pitaka which have been used to preach there
 kintu bodhisattva kaa ullekh usamen nahin he
 After doing this work, each story has been given the form of a Jataka
 titir jataka or dighit kosal jataka kaa nimarn isi prakaar vinay-pitak ke kramshah chullavagg or mahavagg se kiya gaya he
 Manikanth Jataka is also based on vinaya-pitaka
 isi prakaar deergh-nikaay ke kootadant sutt or mahasudassan sutt tathaa majjhim nikaay ke makhadev sutt bhi puure arthon main jataka hai
 At least 13 Jataka people have been discovered by scholars in Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 yadhyapi rajktha chor-katha evam isi prakaar kii bhay, yuddh, gram, nigam, nagar, janapad, stri, panghat, bhoot-pret aadi sambandhi kathaon ko tirashchin kathaayen kahkar bhikshu sangh main heyata kii drushti se dekha jaataa tha
 Nevertheless, monks used to use stories in some quantity for preaching
 swayan bhagwaan ne bhi upamaaon or drushtaanton ke dwaara dharm kaa upadesh diya he
 In the second variation of the Buddhist Sanskrit text Siddharmapundarika Sutra it is also said that the Buddha teaches with many parables and through the Jataka for the welfare of all beings
 buddha ke alaava anya bhartiya sant bhi upanishdon ke kaal se lekar ramakrishna paramhans ke samay tak aakhyayikaon or drushtaanton ke sahare dharmopadesh karte rahe hai
 The Jataka tales have developed on the basis of this trend
 jan samaaj main prachlit kathaon ko bhi kahi-kahin le liya gaya he, kintu unhen ek nayaa naitik rup de diya gaya he, jo buddha dharm kii ek visheshta he
 Hence Buddhism has its full imprint on all Jataka tales
 purv parampara se chale aate hue lok-aakhyaanon kaa aadhaar unamem ho saktaa he, par unka sampoorn dhaanchaa buddha dharm ke naitik adarsh ke anukool he
 The Buddha Vedas have been classified as nine organs, whose names are- buddha vachanon kaa yah nau prakaar kaa vibhaajan unke style swaroopon yaa namoonon kii drushti se hi he, granthon kii drushti se nahin
 There were so many types of Buddha sermons, this is the meaning of this classification
 buddha vachanon kaa nau angon main vibhaajan jinamein jataka kii sankhya saatvin he, atyant pracheen he
 Hence, Jataka stories are important and necessary parts of Pali literature in Sarvansh
 unki sankhya ke vishay main anischitata visheshtah unke samay-samay par sutt pitak or vinay-pitak tathaa anya shroton se sankalan ke kaaran or swayan pali pitak ke naanaa vargikarnon or unke paraspar sanmishran ke kaaran utpann hui he
 In Chulla Niddes, we find only 500 Jatakas
 chini yatri phahyan ne paanchavi shatabdi isvi main 500 jaatakon ke chitra lanka main ankit hue dekhe the
 Pictures of the natives have been found in the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi before the second third century BC
 jinamein se kam se kam 27 yaa 29 jaatakon ke chitron kii pahchaan rais davids ne kii thi
 Since then some other Jataka stories have also been identified on the stone-vesantis of these stupas
 ye sab tathy jataka kii pracheenta or uske vikaas ke suchak hai
 Jataka tales are also found in texts of Sanskrit Buddhism, like Stalistic Pali literature
 pali ke nawang buddha vachan kii tarah yahan dwaad sha ang dharmapravachan maane gayi hai
 In both of these places the Jataka exists as an organ or part of the discourse
 buddha sanskrit granth jatakamala main jo aryashur kii rachana bataai jaati he 34 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Aryasur is called Lama and Taranath is another name for Ashwaghosh, but it does not seem right
 sambhavtah ve chaturth shatabdi isvi ke kavi the
 About 80 Jataka tales are found in the famous epic book Mahavastu written between 200 BCE and 400 BCE
 isamen se kuch pali jataka ke samaan hai or ku chha aisi bhi hai, jo pali jataka main nahin pai jaati
 Raees Davids states that the collection and execution of the Jataka took place on the basis of ancient folklore in the middle country
 vinternitj ne bhi praayah isi mat kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 Most of the people are Buddhakalins
 sanchi or bharhut ke s tupon kii pashaan-veshtoniyon par unke drishyon kaa ankit hona unke purv ashokakaleen hone kaa paryaapt sakshya detaa he
 In relation to the period and curiosity of the person, more light will come from discussing his literary form and characteristics
 prayek jataka katha paanch bhaagon main vibhakt he
 Panchuppannavatthu means the present-day event or story
 buddha ke jivan kaal main jo ghatana ghati vah pacchuppannavatthu he
 That incident gave God the opportunity to say the story of a previous birth
 yah purvajanm kaa vrutt hi atitvatthu he
 The most important part of the story of each person is the past
 isi ke anukool pacchppannavatthu kahin-kahin garh lee gai prathit hoti he
 The past is followed by one or more verses
 inkaa sambandh vaise to atitvatthu se hi hota he, kintu kahin-kahin pacchppannavatthu se bhi hota he
 Gathas are the oldest parts of the native
 vastav main gaathaayen hi jataka hai
 The Jataka, who is composed of five parts, such as Pachchuppannavathu, is actually Jatakattavavana or Jataka comes to Vyayakaran or Athavana
 isamen gaathaon kii vyakhya or unka shabdaarth hota he
 At the last comes a solstice, in which the characters of the Pastavatthu are associated with the characters of the Buddha's life time, as at that time the hunter playing on the attic was the present-day Dev Dutt and the Kurung deer was me, etc
 
 jataka main buddha ke purv janmon kii kathaayen sangruhit he jabaki unhone bodhisattva ke rup main vibhinn parmitaayen puri kin or buddhatv ke liye yogyata sampadit kii
 In the first four bodies of the sutta-pitaka, the historical form of the Buddha is reputed
 baad main jataka main unke aitihaasik jivan ko purv kii kathaon se sambaddh kar diya pate hai
 In Jatakathaktha's Nidan Katha, there are three diagnoses of Buddha life, in Dure Nidana there is a story of Buddha life from very distant past, it is believed that Buddha Sumedha was born as an ascetic in a very remote past
 us samay unhone deepankar buddha main badi nishtha dikhaai jiske parinamswaroop unhone unhen aage chalakar buddha hone kaa aashirwad diya
 The cultivation of the sume and ascetic continued while holding various bodies for many births
 ant main vessantar raja ke rup main sharir tyaag kar ve tushit lok main gayi
 From the form of Sumedha ascetic to the passage to the well-to-do, this cult of Buddha is under distant diagnosis
 547 jataka kathaayen apannak jataka se lekar vessantar jataka tak buddha jeevani ke is duure nidaan se hi sambandhit he
 These stories here mean the past story mentioned in them
 inkaa sambandh buddha kii jivan-katha ke duure nidaan se he arthath ye bahut dur ateet kii kathaayen hai
 From the time of being born in Lumbini forest to the attainment of Bodhi, the story is related to the unhealthy diagnosis
 arthath vah itane dur ateet kii nahin he
 From the attainment of Bodhi to attainment of Nirvana, the Buddha biography is under the diagnosis of Santi
 arthath vah sameep kii he
 Some parts of it come in the form of preface in Jataka's Pachuppannavatthu
 jataka kii kahaniyon main atitvatth main buddha jeevani ke duure nidaan ke andar samavisht unke purv janmon kii kahaniyaan aati he
 a holiday has been taken to tell the stories of these two nidanas by mentioning an event in the life of the historical Buddha
 jo ho vastav main jataka kaa nirmaan karti he
 It is clear from the above discussion of the five parts of each Jataka that the Jataka are prose-verse mixed compositions
 gaatha bhaag jataka kaa pracheenatam bhaag mana jaataa he
 It would be more appropriate to consider this saga part within Tripitaka
 shesh sab atthkatha he
 But the nature of the Jataka tales is such that nothing can be understood by separating the original from the interpretation
 keval gaathaayen kahani kaa nirmaan nahin karti
 When the events of the present and past are put on them, only the story is created
 atah puure jataka main uparyukt paanch avyavon kaa haana aavashyak he jisamen gaatha-bhaag ko chhodkar shesh sab uski vyakhya he baad kaa joda hua he
 Yet for convenience and historically wrongly, we call it Jataka
 vastav main 547 jataka kathaon ke sangrah ko jo uparyukt paanch angon se samanvit he, hamen jataka na kahkar jatakatthawannana yaa jatakatthakatha hi kahana chahie
 Fosbal and Koval, which have been edited and translated in Roman script and in English respectively, or Bhadant Anand Kausalayan in Hindi, have been translated into 6 parts under the title 'jataka', that is actually the interpretation of Jataka rather than Jataka
 jataka kathaayen to mul rup main keval gaathaayen he, shesh bhaag uski vyakhya he
 The question arises as to what is the relationship between the saga and the remaining part of the native in terms of chronology etc
 atathkatha main gaatha-bhaag ko abhisambuddha gaatha yaa bhagavan buddha dwaara bhashit gaathaayen kaha gaya he
 They are Buddhist
 atah ve tipitak ke angabhoot thi or unakon vahaan se sankalit kar unke upar kathaon kaa dhaanchaa prastut kiya gaya he
 On the basis of the classification of the contents of the entire Jataka text, it is also clear that the saga-part, or what the scholars like Pinternnitz, called saga-jataka, is its base
 jataka granth kaa vargeekaran vishay-vastu ke aadhaar par na hokar gaathaon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par hua he
 Like the ther-theri saga, he is also divided into the Nittpas
 jataka main 22 nipaat hai
 There are 150 such stories in the first Nipta, in which a saga of one is found
 duusare nipaat main bhi 150 jataka kathaayen he kintu yahan prayek katha main do-do gaathaayen pai jaati hai
 Similarly, there are fifty-fifty stories in the third and fourth nipatas and the number of gathas is three-three and four-four respectively
 aage bhi terahaven nipaat tak praayah yahi kram chalata he
 The name of the fourteenth fall is Pakinak Nipat
 is nipaat main gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar vividh he
 Hence it has been named Pakinnak
 is nipaat main kuch kathaon main 10 gaathaayen bhi pai jaati he or kuch main 47 tak bhi pai jaati he
 The number of gathas has steadily increased in the future
 pandrahaven nipaat kaa sheershak he vis nipaat, solahaven kaa tins nipaat, satrahawein kaa chattalis nipaat, attharahawein kaa pannas nipaat ,unnisven kaa saththi nipaat, biswein kaa sattatinipat or ikkisven kaa asitinipat
 There are only ten Jataka tales in the bison nipat, but the number of gathas in each is above a hundred
 antik jataka main to gaathaon kii sankhya saat sau se bhi upar he
 All this leads to the conclusion that Jataka is the basis of stories
 swayan anek jataka kathaon ke veyyakaran bhaag main pali or atthkatha ke bich bhed dikhaaya gaya he, jaise ki pali sutton kii anya anek atthakathaon tathaa visuddhimaggon aadi granthon main bhi
 As far as the appropriation part of the native is concerned, there can be only the meaning of Pali, the last story
 bhashaa ke sakshya se bhi gaatha bhaag adhik pracheenta kaa dyotak he apekshaakrit gadhy bhaag ke
 Pinternitz has said that the entire saga of the native cannot be considered as the original part of the Tipitaka
 unamem bhi purvapar bhed he
 This is clear from the classification of the native himself
 chaudaaven nipaat main prayek jataka katha kii gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar kahi-kahin bahut adhik he
 Similarly, in the twentieth fall, the number of his two Jataka stories is 92 and 93 respectively, not seventy-seventy
 is sabase yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya he ki jataka kaa gaathaon athwa gaatha jataka kii mul sankhya nipaat ke sheershak kii sankhya ke anukool hi hogi
 And later it has been augmented
 atah kuch gaatha en adhik pracheen he or kuch apekshaakrit kam pracheen he
 Similarly, the prose section also has some very ancient features and some are relatively ancient
 kisi-kisi jataka main gadhy or gaatha bhaag main samya bhi nahin dikhaai padataa or kahi-kahin style main bhi badi vibhinnata he
 This highlights the computational form and diversity of its linguistic form, with many composers or compilers and the sum of many centuries
 jataka kii gaathaon kii pracheenta to nirvivaad he hi, uskaa adhikansh gadhy bhaag bhi atyant pracheen he
 The pictures inscribed on the stone veins of the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi are related to the prose part of the native
 atah jataka kaa adhikansh gadhy-bhaag jo pracheen he, tritiy, dwitiya shatabdi isvi purv main itnaa lokapriy to hona hin chahie ki use shilp kala kaa aadhaar banaaya ja sake
 Therefore, generally, we can consider the Jataka as a symbol of the Indian society and culture of Buddha
 usamen kuch lakshan or avasthaaon ke chithran praha-buddhakalin bharat ke bhi hai or kuch buddha ke kaal ke baad ke bhi he
 As far as the interpretation and interpretation of the saga is concerned, it is probably the oldest part of the native
 is ansh ke lekhak acharya buddha ghosh maane jate he
 According to 'gandhavans', Acharya Buddhaghosha composed 'jataktatthanna', but it is relevant
