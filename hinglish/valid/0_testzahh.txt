 However, she could not form effective resistance and decided to negotiate their terms with Daniyal
 Hamid Khan, a nobleman, exaggerated and spread the news that Chand Bibi had made a treaty with the Mughals
 According to another version, Jeeta Khan, a eunuch servant of Chand Bibi, thought that her decision to negotiate with the Mughals was a betrayal and spread the news that Chand Bibi was a traitor
 Chand Bibi was then killed by an angry mob of her own army
 unki mrityu or chaar maheene tathaa chaar din ke gheraav ke baad, daniyaal or mirza yusuf khan kii mogul sena dwaara ahmednagar par kabja kar liya gaya

 In the pre-independence period of independence, this village was an important place like a triangular transit point intermediate between the erstwhile three Rajput princely states of Marwar, Jaipur and Bikaner, while presently the village maintains the same geographical importance as the confluence center of the three districts

 Khoda village, located 8 km north of the village, is currently the village of Sujangarh tehsil of Churu district, where the princely state of Bikaner was started in the princely period
 bikaner rajya kaa kshetra sthaneey bolchaal main thali ke naam se janaa jaataa he

 Or earlier this place was located on the route which was the confluence of the two princely states

 On entering the eastern boundary of the village, there was a small pond which was called Nadi or Talaiya in the local dialect
 is talab main praaia barsaat kaa pani sangrahit rahata tha
 Passengers passing through the route often drink water here, sometimes they used to stay here for rest at night because the passengers had easy availability of sweet and clean water for themselves and their animals

 For this reason, we can assume that the importance of this village was slightly more for the state of Marwar

 Children's literature has also been created with his pen
 unka pehla geet kavy sangrah he
 Songs composed from 1924 to 1928 are stored in this collection
 nihar kii vishaywastu ke sambandh main swayan mahadevi verma kaa kathan ullekhneey he- "nihar ke rachana kaal main meri anubhutiyon main waisi hi kautuhal mishrit vednaa umad aati thi, jaise balak ke man main dur dikhaayi dene vaali aprapya sunahali ushaa or sparsh se dur sajal megh ke pratham darshan se utpann ho jaati he
 "these songs have been a natural expression of curiosity mixed anguish
 rashmi mahadevi verma kaa doosraa kavita sangrah he
 It contains compositions from 1927 to 1931
 isamen mahadevi ji kaa chintan or darshan paksh mukhar hota prathit hota he
 Therefore, there is more of philosophical thinking and deliberation than feeling
 main rashmi kaa chintan or darshan adhik spasht or praudh hota he
 The poetess feels joy in pain and pain while coordinating happiness and sorrow
 vah us saamanjasypurna bhavbhumi main pahunch gai hai, jahaan dukh sukh ekaakaar ho jate hai or vednaa kaa madhur ras hi uski samarasata kaa aadhaar ban jaataa he
 This harmonious feeling in the evening song makes it even more mature and serene, bringing the seeker so close to the beloved that she begins to understand the distance between her and the beloved
 main 1934 se 1936 i0 tak ke rachit geet hai
 In these songs, Neerja's expressions get a ripe form
 yahan na keval sukh-dukh kaa balki ansu or vednaa, milan or virah, aashaa or niraashaa evam bandhan-mukti aadi kaa samanvay he
 Deepshikha has songs from 1936 to 1942 AD
 is sangrah ke geeton kaa mukhya pratipaadya swayan mitkar duusare ko sukhi bananaa he
 This is the poetry of the perfection of Mahadevi, in which the lamp of the seeker's soul is unimpressed and unmoved and merges into the unbroken light of the adorable
 main mahadevi kii antim dinon main rachi gayin rachanaayen sangrahit hai jo pathakon ko abhibhoot bhi karengi or aashcharyachakit bhi, is arth main ki mahadevi kavy main ot-prot vednaa or karunaa kaa vah swar, jo kab se unki pahchaan ban chukaa he
 Many compositions have been written in 'agni Rekha', considering the lamp as a symbol
 saath hi anek vishyon par bhi kavitaayen hai
 The official theme of the songs of Mahadevi Varma in Deepshikha is 'prem'
 par prem kii sarthakata unhone milan ke ullaspurn kshanon se adhik virah kii pidaa main talash kii he
 In Saptaparna, Mahadevi with his cultural consciousness has presented Hindi poetry of 39 selected important parts by establishing the identity of Vedas, Ramayana, Ther saga, Ashwaghosh, Kalidas, Bhavabhuti and Jayadeva
 aarambh main 61 prishthiya ‘apni baat’ main unhone bhartiya manisha or sahitya kii is amuly dharohar ke sambandh main gahan shodhapurna vimarsh bhi prastut kiya he
 Jayadev is revered by Mahadevi Varma on the seventh step after 'arashvani, Valmiki, Theragatha, Ashwaghosh, Kalidas and Bhavabhuti under' Saptaparna '
 unhone bataaya he ki jayadev kaa jab aavirbhaav hua tab sanskrit ke shringaari kavy ke nayak-nayika ke rup main radhakrishna kii pratishtha ho chuki thi
 


 Mahadevi ji while presenting poetry in selected sections of Sanskrit and Pali literature in 'saptaparna' has kept his vision focused on the history of Indian contemplation and tradition of aesthetics
 unki yah kriti unhen ek safal srujanaatmak kavyanuvadak, saahityetihaaskaar tathaa samskruti-chintak ke rup main pratishthit karne main purna samarth he, isamen andeh nahin
 Neehar is the creation of the bright times of life, in which Satya seems seductive and curious even while hiding in the sky
 'rashmi' yuvavastha ke praarambhik dinon kii rachana he
 When the rays of truth ignite the flame of knowledge in the soul
 'neeraja' kavyitri kii praudh maansik sthiti kii kriti he, jisamen din ke ujjwal prakaash main kamalini kii tarah vah apane sadhana maarg par apana saurabh bikharaa detii hai
 In the 'sandhyagita', along with the compassion and compassion of the evening of life, the soul's tendency to return to its spiritual home is present
 'deepashikha' main raat ke shant, snigdh or shunya vaataavaran main aradhy ke sammukh jivan deep ke jalte rahane kii bhaavana pramukh he
 In this way, he divided the Ahorarat of his life into these five symbolic titles and made it clear the point of his spiritual practice
 vednaa kii is ekant sadhana ke falswaroop mahadevi kii kavita main vishyon kaa vaividhya bahut kam he
 There are only a few of his poems in which national and cultural discourse or independent portrayal of nature has been done
 shesh sabhi kavitaaon main vishaywastu or drushtikon ek hi hone ke kaaran unki kavyabhumi vistrut nahin ho saki hai
 This has caused both loss and gain to his poetry
 haani yah hui he ki vishay parivartan na hone se unke samast kavy main ekresata or bhavavriti bahut adhik he
 The advantage has been that within the limited area, the poet has depicted many dimensions of the sensations from several perspectives by looking at their microcosmic distinctions in front of them
 is tarah unke kavy main vistaargat vishalata or darshanagat gurutv bhale hi na mili, par unki bhaawanaaon kii gambhirtha, anubhutiyon kii sookshmata, bimbon kii spashtataa or kalpana kii kamaniyata ke falswaroop ganbhiry or mahatta avashya he
 In this way, his poetic expansion is not a poem of depth
 mahadevi kaa kavy varnanaatmak or itivrittatmak nahin hai
 He has expressed inner subtle feelings in the form of innate sensations
 is kaaran unki abhivyanjana paddati main lakshanikta or vyanjaktaa kaa bahulya he
 The seductive images he presents with metaphorical images and symbols reveal his subtle vision and power of colorful imagination
 ye chitra unhone apane pariparshv, visheshkar prakritik parivesh se liye hai par prakruti ko unhone alamban rup main bahut kam grahan kiya
 Prakriti has always been depicted in his poetry only in the form of stimulation, ornamentation, symbol and symbol
 isi kaaran prakruti ke ati parichit or sarvajansulabh drishyon yaa vastuon ko hi unhone apane kavy kaa upadan banaaya hai
 His extraordinary and understated scenes have gone unnoticed
 phir bhi simit prakritik upaadaanon ke dwaara unhone jo purna yaa aanshik bimb chitrit kiye hai, unase unki chitravidhaayini kalpana kaa puraa parichay mil jaataa he
 The philosophy of this imagination is also seen in his paintings, which he has created not through words but through colors and paintbrush
 unke ye chitra 'deepashikha' or 'yama' main kavitaaon ke saath prakashit hue hai
 Mahadevi Varma has written- 'those who touch the philosopher of art have no name other than artist, no class other than seeker, no capital other than truth, no business other than sentiment and none other than welfare
 Not profit
 ' lekhan-avadhi main unhone ekanishtha hokar abaadh-gati se bhavamay srijan or karmmay jivan kii sadhana main likhi hui baat ko sarthak banaaya
 There is a Mahadevi who has also realized the heart of poetry in prose and has made a proclamation of 'prose Kavinam Nikshman Vadanti'
 vilakshan baat to yah he ki na to unhone upanyaas likhaa, na kahani, na hi naatak phir bhi shreshth gadhykar hai
 His writings include sketches, memoirs or travelogue on the one hand and editorials, roles, essays and address on the other hand, but all of them have diversified life as a whole
 bina kalpanashrith kavy roopon kaa sahaara liye koi rachanaakaar gadhy main itnaa kuch arjeet kar saktaa he, yah mahadevi ko padhakar hi janaa ja saktaa he
 Like Chandrakanta Mani in Hindi literature, Mahadevi Varma, the goddess of the volatile Karun Rasa, is not only a distinguished artist, poetess and prose writer, but is also an outstanding essayist
 unka gadhy kavita kii bhaanti saundarya ke bhulaave main daalkar hamen jivan se dur nahin le jaataa, vah to hamaari shiraaon main chetana bharkar hamen yatharth jivan main jhaankne kii prerana pradaan karata he
 Lines of Smriti and constant curiosity in the movie of the past, Sheel Mahadevi has immortalized those characters by portraying various forms of life very tenderly by indelible lines based on Smriti
 inamen gaanv, ganwai ke nirdhan, vipann log, balvidhwaaon, vimaataaon, punarvivaahitaaon tathaa kathith bhrashtaon or vruddh-vivaah ke kaaran prataditaaon ke atyant shashakt evam karun chitra he
 Mahadevi has rightly depicted not only women but also neglected men
 rama, ghisa, alopi or badalu aadi ke rekhachitr unke asaadhaaran maanavtawaad kii ore ingit karte hai
 Mahadevi has depicted the characteristics, weaknesses and problems of lower class characters in most of his drawings
 sevak rama kii vatsalyapurna seva, bhangin sabia kii pati-parayanata or sahansheeltaa, ghisa kii nishchal gurubhakti, saag-bhaaji ke vikreta andhe alopi kaa saral vyaktitv, kumbhakaar badalu tathaa radhiva kaa saral daanpaty prem, pahaad kii ramani lakshamaa kaa mahadevi ke prati anupam sneh-bhav, vruddh bhakthin kii pragalbhta tathaa swami-bhakthi, chini yuvak kii karun-maarmik jivan-gaatha, parvaty kuli jangbahadur tathaa uske anuj dhaniya kii karmthata aadi anek vishyon ko rekhachitron main sthaan diya he
 Mahadevi has presented all the memorabilia from within her life, so it is only natural that various events of her own life and various parts of her character have got place
 unhone apni anubhutiyon ko jyon kaa tyon yatharth rup main ankit kiya he
 It is worth mentioning here that the element of characterization has been prominent in Mahadevi's sketches, the story has appeared in her embrace
 unke in rekhachitron main gambhir lok kaa bhi paryaapt samavesh hua he
 In 'path Ke Saathi', Mahadevi portrays her contemporary creators
 jis sammaan or atmiyatapurna dhang se unhone in sahityakaron kaa jivan-darshan or swabhaavgat mahanata ko sthapit kiya he vah apane aap main badi uplabdhi he
 There are also memoirs in 'path's companions' and the life pages of poets read by Mahadevi
 unhone ek ore sahityakaron kii nikatataa, atmiyata or prabhaav kaa kaavyatmak ullekh kiya he or duusari ore unke samgr jivan darshan ko parakhane kaa praytn kiya he
 In the 'path of Saathi' the lines of Kavindra Ravindra, Dadda, Prasad, Nirala, Pant, Subhadrakumari Chauhan and Siyaramsharan Gupta have come in the form of word-pictures
 shrunkhlaa kii kadiyaan' main saamaajik samasyaon, vishesh kar abhishpt nari jivan ke jalte prashnon ke sambandhon main likhe unke vichaaratmak niabandh sankalit hai
 Apart from creative prose, 'critical prose of Mahadevi' and his critical talent in the roles of 'deepshikha', 'vama' and 'modern poet- Mahadevi' can be easily realized

 kaha jaataa he ki inhone 11veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main baharich main gazanvi senapati saiyad salaar masood gaazi ko parajeet kar maar daalaa tha
 He is mentioned in the historical fictional tale mirat-e-masudi of the 17th-century Persian language
 20veen shatabdi ke baad se, vibhinn hindu rashtravaadi samoohon ne unhen ek hindu raja ke rup main chihnit kiya he jisane muslim akramanakariyon ko haraa diya
 The legend of Salar Masood and Suheldev is found in the mirat-i-masudi of the Persian language

 At the age of 16, Syed Salar Masood Ghazi, nephew of Mahmud Ghaznavi, invaded India by crossing the Indus River and conquered Multan, Delhi, Meerut and finally Satrikh
 satrikh main, unhone apane mukhyalay kii sthapana kii or sthaneey raajaaon ko haraane ke liye senaaon ko bhej diya
 Syed Saif-ud-din and Mian Rajab were sent to Bahraich
 baharich ke sthaneey raja or anya padosi hindu raajaaon ne ek sangh kaa gathan kiya lekin masood ke pita saiyad salaar sahu gaji ke netritv main sena ne unhen haraa diya
 Nevertheless, he continued to rage and so in 1033, Masood himself came to check his progress in Bahraich
 suheldev ke aagaman tak, masood ne apane dushmano ko har baar haraaya
 Finally in 1034, Suheldev's army defeated Masood's army in a battle and Masood was killed
 masood ko baharich main dafnaaya gaya tha or san 1035 main vahaan uski yaad main ek dargah banaai gai thi

 Pasi is a Dalit community and also has a significant vote bank around Bahraich

 Software bugs are a common term used to describe an error, defect, fault, failure, or fault of a computer program or system that produces incorrect and unexpected results or causes it to behave in an unexpected way
 
 zyaadaatar bag logon dwaara kisi program ke strot code yaa isaki dizin main kii gayi galatiyon or trutiyon kii vajah se utpann hote hai or kuch galat code banane vaale compileron ke kaaran paidaa hote hai
 a program in which a large number of bugs are found and / or bugs that interfere badly with its functionality is called buggy
 kisi program main bag kaa byora dene vaali report ko aam taur par bag report, folt report, problem report, trubal report, change request or isi tarah ke naamon se janaa jaataa he
 The bug activates Type i and Type II errors, which in turn can cause a wide range of waveform effects, causing the user of the program to experience a variety of inconveniences
 kuch bag program kii kaaryakshmata par sirf ek halkaa sa prabhaav daalate hai or is tarah ek lambey samay tak unka pataa hi nahin chal paata he
 More serious bugs can cause the program to crash or freeze, causing it to shut down

 The use of the word "bug" to describe inexplicable defects has been a part of engineering jargon for many decades and before the advent of computers and computer software; Perhaps it was originally used to explain mechanical malfunctions in hardware engineering
 udhaaharan ke liye, thomas edison ne 1878 main apane ek sahyogi ke liye ek patr main nimnaankit shabdon ko likhaa tha: The problems associated with radar electronics during World War II were called bugs and there is additional evidence that it was in use long back
 1931 main pehle yantric pinbaal game, baifal ball ko "bag se mukt" kahkar vigyaapit kiya gaya tha
 The discovery of the word "bug" is often attributed to Grace Hooper, who propagated the cause of an early electromechanical computer malfunction

 Bugs are a consequence of the nature of human aspects in the process of programming
 ve vinirdesan, dizin, koding, data pravishti or pralekhan ke dauraan ek software team dwaara kii gai chook yaa aapasi galatfahami se utpann hoti hai
 For example: In order to create a relatively simple program to decorate a list of words in alphabetical order, a design may fail to explain what should be done in the event of hyphen appearing in a word
 sambhawatah kaalpanik dizin ko chuni gayi programing kii bhashaa main parivartit karte samay koi vyakti anjaane main ek of-bai-van truti taiyaar kar saktaa he or is tarah suchi main antim shabd ko sajaane main asafal rah saktaa he
 Finally, when typing the resulting program into a computer it must accidentally be a '', which may result in the words being decorated in reverse alphabetical order
 kisi computer program ke vibhinn bhaagon ke bich anayas sampark se or adhik jatil bag utpann ho sakate hai
 This often happens because computer programs can be complex - in some cases millions of long lines - which can often be programmed by many people over a fairly long period of time, so such programmers mentally They are unable to figure out all possible ways which parts can contact
 res condishan naamak ek anya shrenee kaa bag yaa to us samay aata he jab koi prakriya ek se adhik thread main yaa do yaa do se adhik prakriyaaon main ek saath chal rahi hoti he or jab code ke mahatvapurn kramon ke nishpaadan ke bilkul sahi kram ko sahi tareeke se samakalik nahin kiya gaya hota he
 The software industry has put a lot of effort into finding ways to protect programmers from inadvertently incorporating bugs while writing software
 inamen shaamil hai: Bug detection and removal or "debugging" are often an important part of computer programming
 ek praarambhik computer visheshgy, mauris wilcase ne 1940 ke dashak main apni ek anubhuti main ullekh kiya tha ki unki jindagi kaa adhikansh shesh bhaag apane swayan ke prograamon kii galatiyon kaa pataa lagane main biit jayega
 jaise-jaise computer program or adhik jatil hote jate hai, bag or adhik saamaanya evam mushkil se dur kiye jane vaale ho jate hai
 Programmers often take more time to detect and fix bugs than to write new code and spend far more effort
 software pareekshak aise peshewar vyakti hote hai jinka pramukh kaary bagon kaa pataa lagaana yaa pareekshan main sahyog karne vaale code likhnaa hota he
 In some projects, more resources can be spent on testing than developing programs
 aam taur par dibging kaa sabase adhik mushkil bhaag strot code main bag kaa pataa lagaana he
 Once it is detected, it is usually relatively easy to fix
 dibgar ke rup main jane jane vaale program bhi maujuud hai jo ek-ek line kar code ko karyanvit karne, parivarti maanon par najar rakhane or program ke aacharan ko samajhane vaali anya suvidhaon ke jariye bag kaa pataa lagane main programmeron kii madad karte hai
 Code can be added in such a way that the messages or values are written in a console with the printf) in the programming language) to show the implementation of the program without a debugger or to show the values) or written in a window or in a log file Can go haalanki, ek dibgar kii sahaayta se bhi bag kaa pataa lagaana kuch had tak ek kala he
 It is not uncommon for a bug present in one section of a program to cause a failure in another section completely, which makes it particularly difficult to detect in an apparently unrelated part of the system
 kabhi-kabhi bag ek alag dosha nahin hota he balki yah programmer kii ore se soch yaa yojana kii ek truti kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Such logical errors require complete repair or rewriting of that part of the program
 code samiksha ke hisse ke rup main, agar aisa dikhaaya ja sake ki iske karyanvayan main kuch trutipurna tark maujuud hai, ek vishesh prakaar ke code kaa istemaal karke aise kisi bag ko dubaara utpann kiye bina hi aksar in trutiyon kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 But more specifically, the first step in detecting a bug is to reproduce it reliably
 ek baar jab bag ko punah prastut kar diya jaataa he, programmer doshapurn kshetra main program ke kriyanvayan kii nigaraanee karne ke liye ek dibgar kaa yaa kisi anya upkaran kaa istemaal kar saktaa he or us sthaan kaa pataa laga saktaa he jisamen program apane uddeshy se bhatak gaya he
 Reproducing bugs is often not easy
 kuch bag program kii nivishtiyon dwaara utpann hote hai jinhen punah utpann karnaa programmer ke liye mushkil ho saktaa he
 One of the causes of Thirac-25 radiation machine deaths was a bug that occurred only when the machine operator entered a treatment plan too quickly; It took several days of practice to be able to do this task, so the bug did not occur during testing or at the time the manufacturer tried to copy it
 anya bag program ko ek dibgar ke jariye chalaaye jane se gaayab ho sakate hai; ye hygenebags hote hai 
 Debugging is still a boring task that requires considerable effort
 1990 ke dashak se, vishesh rup se arian 5 flite 501 kii durghatana ke baad se dibging main prabhavi swachaalit sahyog viksit karne main nae sire se dilchaspee badi he
 For example, methods of variable code analysis through hypothetical interpretation have already made significant achievements, although much of the remaining work is still in progress
 jaisaa ki kisi bhi rachanaatmak kaary ke saath hota he, kabhi-kabhi prerana kii ek chamak bhi ek samaadhaan dikhaa detii he, lekin yah durlabh he or paribhaasha ke anusaar, is par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Classes are also organized for bugs that make no sense to the code itself
 udhaaharan ke liye, agar koi ek doshapurn pralekhan yaa hardware par nirbhar he, code puri tarah se sahi tareeke se usee rup main likhaa ja saktaa he jaisaa ki pralekhan kahata he lekin lekin bag vastav main pralekhan yaa hardware main rahata he, code main nahin
 However, it is common to change the code rather than other parts of the system, as it takes less time and cost to change it
 sannihit pranaaliyon main hardware bag ke liye aksar varderound hote hai, kyonki hardware kaa punarnirmaan karne kii tulana main rome kaa ek nayaa sanskaran taiyaar karnaa kahin adhik sasta hota he, vishesh rup se agar ye camodity item hote hai
 It is common practice to release software with known bugs that are considered to be non-critical, ie that do not affect most users' core experiences with the product
 chunki paribhaasha ke anusaar software utpaadon main kisi bhi sankhya main agyaat bag maujuud ho sakate hai, pareekshan ke dauraan maapan se bache hue sambhavit bagon kii sankhya kaa ek anumaan praapt kiya ja saktaa he; utpaada ko jitani der tak pareekshan yaa viksit kiya jaataa he vah or adhik vishwasaneey ho jaataa he 
 zyaadaatar badi software pariyojnaon ke paas "gyaat bag" kii do suchiyaan hoti hai - ek vah jiske bare main software team ko jaankaree hoti he or duusari jiske bare main upyogkartaaon ko bataaya jaataa he
 This is not to hide the facts but rather the users do not pay attention to the internal functioning of the product
 duusari suchi upyogkartaaon ko un bagon ke bare main jaankaree detii he jinhen maujuuda relies main yaa bilkul bhi dur nahin kiya gaya he or ek varderound kii peshkash bhi kii ja sakati he
 There are several reasons why bugs are not removed: uparokt ko dekhte hue kisi vaastavik jatilta vaale ek puri tarah se bag-mukt software kaa lekhan aksar asambhav mana jaataa he
 Thus bugs are classified based on their severity and low-intensity non-critical bugs are tolerated as they do not affect the proper operation of the system for most users
 nasa ke esetisi ne trutiyon kii sankhya prati 1000 linon ke code main 0
1 se bhi kam karne main kamyaabi hasil kii thi lekin ise kisi vaastavik duniya ke project ke liye sambhav nahin samajha gaya
 The severity of a bug does not equal the importance of its fix and both should be measured and managed separately
 ek microsoft windos system par maut kaa nila screen apekshaakrit ek gambhir hota he lekin agar yah keval charam paristhitiyon main hota he, khaas taur par agar ye acchhee tarah upachaarit or parihaary hote hai, kisi iken dwaara apane kaary kaa sahi pratidhinitv nahin kiye jane kii tulana main isamen sudhaar kiya janaa kam mahatvapurn ho saktaa he jo haalanki puri tarah saundarya se sambandhit he lekin yah har din hajaaron upyogkartaaon ko bhramit kar saktaa he
 This balance obviously depends on many factors; Expert users have different expectations from novices, a high-end market differs from a general consumer market and other similar markets
 ek behatar santulan praapt karne ke liye kuch software develper ek aupchaarik bag tries prakriya kaa upyog karte hai jisamen prayek nae bag ko isaki gambhirtha, aavriti, jokhim or anya purv-nirdhaarit karkon ke aadhaar par ek praathamikta di jaati he
 Eric S
 An ideology promoted by Raymond as Line's Law states that popular open-source software has more or less bugs in comparison to other software because "upon greater attention, all bugs are lighter"
 This claim has been disputed, however: computer security expert Elias Levy has written that "it is far easier to hide vulnerabilities in complex, less obvious, and unrecognized source code" because "even if people review the code So this does not mean that they are qualified to do so
