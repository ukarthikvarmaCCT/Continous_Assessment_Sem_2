 One example of deforestation is from the United States after Germany in the Second World War
 Germany, defeated before the start of the Cold War, was considered a potential future threat rather than a potential future ally

 Sources in the US government stated that its objective was "the eventual destruction of the possibility of war in the forests of Germany
" This practice of clear-cutting resulted in deforestation "which could only be replaced by prolonged forestry development during a century

 " War can also be a cause of deforestation, either deliberately using the Agent Orange in the Vietnam War where, with bombs and bulldozers, it destroyed 44 percent of the forest cover, or inadvertently such as the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 Where bombing and other combat operations transformed the tropical landscape into a heap of mud, lead, decomposing materials and megats

ISBN 0-521-57658-X endoscope kaa arth he andar dekhnaa, or khaastaur par iskaa arth hota he chikitsiya kaaran se endoscope kii madad se sharir ke andar dekhnaa
 The endoscope is a device that is used to examine inside the hollow organs or perforations of the body
 anya chikitsiya chithran upkarnon ke vipareet endoscope ko sidhe hi sharir ke ang main daalaa jaataa he
 Endoscopy may also refer to the use of borescopes in technical situations in which direct line-of-sight observation is not practical

 However the Vienna Medical Society disapproved of such curiosity
 1822 main maikinek island, michigan ke ek sainya shalya-chikitsak wiliam bumont dwaara pehla endoscope viksit kiya gaya
 The first major step towards improving endoscopy was the use of electric light in it
 aise shuruaati prakaash strot bahari the
 Later small bulbs became available that made it possible to obtain internal light, for example in a hysteroscope developed by Charles David in 1908

 His intention was to develop such a device with the help of which doctors could be able to see inside the human body

 The area under examination of the inner part of the human body was illuminated by the Miniature Electric Lamp
 is baat ke prayaas kiye gaye ki endoscopy tub ke jariye bahari strot se sharir ke andar prakaash ko paravartit kiya ja sake
 Karl Storge adopted a plan: he tried to put very bright, but cool, light through the device into the body, to get the best visibility inside the body, as well as to provide objective documentation through image transmission

 However, it was Harold Hopkins who, along with his engineering talent and vision, eventually created a revolution in the field of medical optics through the work of an optical designer
 gastroscope ko pehali baar 1952 main ek japani doctor or optical ejiniyaron kii team dwaara viksit kiya gaya
 Mutsuo Sugiura, under the joint auspices of Olympus Corporation, worked with Doctor Tatsuro Yuji and his colleague Shoji Fukami to develop a device they had previously dubbed the "gastro Camera"
 isamen ek nanha-sa camera ek lacheele tip par lite balb ke saath judaa hua tha
 With this help, he was able to take pictures of stomach ulcers and detect stomach cancer in the initial stage, which were not caught by X-rays
 1950 ke dashak kii shuruaati daur main harold hopkins ne ek “fibroscope” kaa nirmaan kiya, jo chikitsa or udyog, donon hi kshetron main upyogi sabit hua
 Subsequent research and development on these fibers led to further improvement in picture quality

 This capability evolved with developments in the optical field, in which it was possible to "operate" the tip by the controls placed in the hands of the endoscopist, as well as to remotely operate the surgical instrument inside the endoscope
 Also new facilities were acquired
 yah us shalya-chikitsa kii shuruyaat thi, jise ham aaj kii-hole surgery ke naam se jaanate hai
 Fernando Elves Martins of Portugal invented the first fiber optics endoscope
 haalanki, fibroscope kii chitra gunvattta kii bhautik simaaen thim
 In modern terminology, a bundle of 50,000 fibers effectively gives a picture of only 50,000 pixels, apart from this the fiber changes due to frequent changes in usage and thus gradually reduces pixels
 antat itani kshati ho jaati he ki samooche bandal ko badalane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Hopkins felt that any next optical correction would require a different method
 purv ke sakht endoscope main kaaphi kam lite transmittence tathaa kamjor image quality kii samasya thi
 There was no specific scope for imaging optics due to the need for surgical tools for surgical operations and the need for the illumination system to pass through the endoscope tube
 paaramparik pranali ke chote lens ko sahaayak ring kii jarurat thi, jo lens ke ek bade bhaag ko adhigrahit karata tha; jinhen nirmit karnaa or ek saath rakhana kaaphi kathin tha, saath hi optical rup se ve naakaam bhi the
 The sophisticated diagnosis that Hopkins presented was to fill the space between the 'little lens' with a glass rod
 ye thik-thik endoscope tub main feet ho jate the, jisase ve swa-sanrekhi ban gaye tathaa unhen ‘little lens’ ko puri tarah se vitarit karne ke liye kisi samarthan kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahi
 The rod-lens was easy to operate and use and used the maximum available diameter

 With such a small diameter high quality 'telescope' the tool and illuminance system could easily be placed inside an outer tube
 ek baar phir karl stores ne hi do vyaktiyon ke bich ke lambey rachanaatmak sahyog ke rup main pehle-pahal in nae endoscopon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Although there are certain areas of the body that will forever require flexible endoscopes, hard rod-lens endoscopes have such exceptional performance that they are still a favorite instrument in modern times, and indeed modern key-hole surgery

 After the constitution was changed in India in 1950, Pakistan's lawmakers stepped up efforts to establish their constitution
 pradhanmantri mohammad ali or unki sarkaar ke adhikariyon ne desh main vipakshi dalon ke sahyog ke saath pakistan ke liye ek samvidhan taiyaar karne ke liye kaam kiya
 Finally, because of this joint work, the first set of constitutions was implemented
 yah ghatana 23 march 1956 ko hui thi,is din ko aaj bhi pakistan ke samvidhan ke pravartan ke uplakshya main ganatantraa diwas manaata he
 This constitution provided Pakistan with a "unicameral legislature" parliamentary system of government
 saath hi, isane aadhikarik taur par pakistan ko ek islamic ganraajya ghoshit bhi kiya
 Furthermore, in it, the principle of parity was also introduced for the first time
 samvidhan dwaara, iskundar mirza ne adhyaksh pad grahan kiya, lekin rashtriya maamalon main unki lagaataar asanvaidhanik bhagidaari ke kaaran, chaar nirvaachit pradhanmantriyon ko maatr do saalon main hi barkhaast kar diya gaya
 Under public pressure, President Iskandar Mirza upheld the coup in 1958; And thus this constitution was almost suspended
 sheeghra hi baad main general ayub khan ne iskundar mirza apdasth or khud ko raashtrapati ghoshit kar diya
 And so this constitution was able to run only for 3 years
 17 farvari 1960, ko ayub khan ne desh ke bhavishya ke raajnneetik dhaanche par report karne ke liye ek ayog kii niyukti kii
 The commission was formed with ten other members headed by former Chief Justice of Pakistan, Mohammad Shahabuddin
 isamen purvi pakistan se paanch sadsy or paanch pashchimi pakistan se bhi paanch sadsy the
 It was composed entirely of retired judges, lawyers, industrialists and landlords
 is samvidhan ayog kii report ko 6 may 1961 ko raashtrapati ayub ke samaksh prastut kii gai or raashtrapati or unke mantrimandal dwaara jaanch ke pashchaat janvari 1962 main, cabinet ant main nae samvidhan ke mul paath ko manjuuri de di gai
 It was implemented by President Ayub on 1 March 1962 and finally came into effect on 8 June 1962
 yah samvidhan nihit 250 lekh baarah bhaagon or teen kaarykram main baanta gaya tha
 Like the previous constitution, it also talked about building Pakistan on Islamic values and keeping a unicameral legislature
 parantu 1956 ke samvidhan ke mukaable is samvidhan kii pariyojnaon ke mutabik pakistan ke raashtrapati ko anek karyadhikaar diye gaye the, or multah ek adhyakshiya vyavastha gathit kii gai thi
 Like the constitution of 1956, the constitution of 1962 did not last long
 pakistan main doosraa marshall lau, 26 march 1969 ko lagaaya gaya tha jab raashtrapati ayub khan ne 1962 main samvidhan niraakrit kiya or sena ke commander-in-chif general aagaa mohammad yahya khan ko satta saunp diya
 Upon assuming the presidency, General Yahya Khan overthrew the one-unit system on popular demand in West Pakistan and ordered a general election on the principle of one man one vote

 The term design or design is used in applied arts, engineering, architecture and other similar creative works and fields
 ise kriya ke rup main evam sangya ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Design as a verb refers to the process that is adopted to bring or develop a product, structure, system or goods
 sangya ke rup main dizin shabd do arthon main prayukt hota he- Nowadays processes are also considered to be the result of design
 is arth main prakriya kii dizin kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Many goals are set under the design
 inamen pramukh aavashyaktaayen hai - kaary sambandhi, aakaar va aaytan sambandhi, mulya yaa laagat sambandhi, shakti kii aavashyaktaa sambandhi, rakrakhaav tathaa bigadne par sudhaar sambandhi, vibhinn bhaagon ko aapas main jodne main aasaani sambandhi, nirmaan evam utpaan main saralata aadi
 Design For the achievement of a predetermined goal, it is the 'design' to systematically organize the ideas and all the other related items
 vaastuvid kisi bhawan ke nirmaan kii yojana banaate hue rekhaon kaa vibhinn roopon main ankan kisi ek lakshya kii purti ko sochakar karata he
 The artist also tries to present a special effect or idea in the picture by combining lines
 isi prakaar imarti ejeeniyar kisi imaarat main sunishchit tikaaupan or dridhtaa laane ke liye uski vividh maapon ko niyat karata he
 All things are under design
 vaastuvid kaa kartavya he ki vah aisa vyavhaarya abhiklpana prastut kare jo bhavannirmaan kii lakshyapurti main suvidhajanak evam mitavyayi ho
 At the same time, he should also keep in mind that the size of the building should be compatible with the neighborhood of that area and can also match with the old buildings standing around Eid
 maan lijie, id-gird ke sabhi makaan mehrabadar daravajevaale hai, to unke bich ek sapaat daat ke daron kaa, sade dhang ke samnevaala makaan shobhaa nahin degaa
 Similarly, there are many other things which should be considered keeping in view the lateral environment
 duusari vishesh baat jo vaastuvid ke liye vichaarneey he, vah he bhawan ke bahari aakaar ke vishay main ek sthir mat kaa nirnay
 It should be such that even a person walking on the road should understand the building without asking what it is built for
 jaise, ek kalege ko aspataal sareekha nahin laganaa chahie or na hi aspataal kii akruti kalege sareekhee honi chahie
 The bunk building should look sturdy and safe and the exterior of the playhouse or cinema hall should be adorable
 vaastuvid ko yah sunishchit hona chahie ki usne us puure kshetra kaa bharpoor upyog kiya he jisapar use bhawan nirmit karnaa he
 Artistic designs also include painting of curtains for entertainment or theater, various types of paintings for decoration, making graffiti to express a particular idea
 kalakaar kii khubi isi main he ki vah apni abhiklpana ko yatharth aakaar de
 The painting should symbolize the living expression of the artist's thoughts
 chitra kii aavashyaktaa ke anusaar kalakaar pencil ke rekhachitr, tailchitr, pani ke rangon ke chitra aadi banaae
 The engineer of the buildings has to make his design according to the design of the architect so that the building is strong enough to handle all the loads falling on it
 is drushti se vah nirmaan ke liye vishisht upkarnon kaa chunaav karata he or aise nirmaan padaarth lagane kaa aadesh detaa he jisase imaarat sasti tathaa tikaoo ban sake
 For this, it is also necessary to keep in mind whether the specific materials recommended for manufacture are available in the market, or whether there is a lack of the desired efficiency to implement the suggested specific work styles
 bhaar kaa anumaan karne main swayan imaarat kaa bhaar, banate samay yaa uske upyog main aane par uskaa chal bhaar, chal bhaaron ke aghat kaa prabhaav, hawa kii daab, bukamp ke dhakkon kaa parinaam, taap, sankoch, neenv ke baithne aadi anek baton ko dhyaan main rakhana padataa he
 Some of these weights can be calculated finely, but there are many that can only be estimated based on past experiences
 jaise bukamp ke bal ko len---iskaa anumaan bada kathin he or is baat kii koi purvakalpana nahin ho sakati ki bukamp kitne bal kaa or kahan par hoga
 However, luckily, the effect of most moving and fixed weights can be calculated quite accurately
 taap evam sankochajanit daabon kaa bhi paryaapt sahi anumaan puure rituchakra ke tapon main hone vaale vyatikramon ke adhyayan tathaa kancreet ke gyaat gunon dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 The forces due to wind and earthquake are ultimately uncertain, but there is usually no loss due to a slight error in their estimation of the quantity
 nirmansaamagree saadhaarant: itani pusht lagaai jaati he ki daab aadi balon main 33 pratishat vruddhi hone par bhi kisi prakaar kii haani kii ashanka na rahe
 a good estimate of sinking of the foundation is made by a proper examination of the soil below
 prayek abhikalpak ko kuch agyaat tathyon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana hota he, yatha kaarigaren kii aakshamata, kisi samay logon kii akalpit bheed kaa bhaar, istemaal main laae gaye padaarthon kii chhipi sambhavya kamajoriyaan ityadi
 These facts are placed under the 'safety factor', which is assumed to be 2 to 1 / 2 for steel and 3 to 4 for concrete, timber and other equipment
 surakshagunak ko bhawan par atirikt bhaar ladane kaa bahaanaa nahin bananaa chahie
 This is only for unknown reasons and even to a lesser extent, which can prove to be helpful in the future to bear the brunt of the building, disrepair and weather uncertainties

 yahi baad main shankaracharya dwaara shastrarth main parajeet hokar sanyasi ho gaye or unka naam sureshwarachaarya padaa
 There is a big dispute about whether Mandan and Sureshwar are the same or different
 adhikansh pramaan donon kii bhinnata ke paksh main hi milte hai
 Mandan has supported Shabdvaita, but Sureshwar is silent about it
 mandan ne advaitaprasthaan main anyathaakhyatvaad kaa bahut had tak samarthan kiya, par sureshwar iskaa khandan karte hai
 According to Mandan, the living being is the shelter of avidya, Sureshwar considers Brahm to be the shelter and poison of avidya
 isi matbhed ke aadhaar par advait vedant ke do prasthaan chal pade
 Bhamati became a follower of Departure Mandan, the description followed the principles of Departure Sureshwar
 sureshwar shuddhgyan ko moksh kaa maarg maanate hai par mandan ke anusaar vedant ke shravanamaatr se moksh nahin miltaa, jab tak agnihotra aadi karm gyaan ke sahakaari na ho yahi nahin, kisi pracheen pramanik granth main mandan or sureshwar ko ek nahin mana gaya he
 There is no irrefutable evidence that Mandan Mishra was a disciple of Kumaril Bhatt
 yah baat keval 'shankar-digvijay' ke aadhaar par kahi jaati he, jo ki ek nitant apramanik katha-pustak he
 When most of the evidence is found about the difference between Mandan and Sureshwar, it is in no way fair to say that Mandan was the only one who became Sureshwar after being defeated in scripture
 darasal in donon mahapurushon ke bich shastrarth hone kii baat hi puri tarah kaalpanik or ranneetik he, jo madhyakaal main shankar ke math dwaara prachaarit kiya gaya
 Whatever Sureshwar's views about Shabdvaita, otherwise factualism, avidya, jiva, brahma, etc
, are following the hundred percent Shankaracharya
 guru ke charnon kii priti hi unka param lakshya he
 He opposes Mandan to the extent of intolerance and calls him the Advaitavedanti of a separate departure
 phir, vahi sureshwar swayan mandan kaise ho sakate hai?'vivaran-prasthaan' ke pravartak sureshwar nahin, 'vivaran-car' hai, jabaki 'bhaamati-prasthaan'puri tarah mandan kaa anugaman karata he
 When Mandan and Sureshwar have not been considered as one in any ancient book, then why are our scholars and teachers troubled with the burden of the myth of scripture from time to time
 ab bhi to sach ko sweekaar kiya jaae
