 Chhatrasal's life was spent fighting against the Mughal power and fighting for the independence of Bundelkhand
 maharaja chhatrasaal apane jivan ke antim samay tak akramanon se jujhate rahe
 These lines are very impressive about the famous Maharaja Chhatrasal by the name of Bundelkhand Keshari: chanpatrai jab samay bhoomi main jivan-maran kaa sangharsh jhel rahe the unheen dinon jyeshtha shukla 3 samvath 1707 ko vartmaan tikamgarh jile ke lighora vikaas khand ke antargat kakar kachnaae gram ke paas sthit vindhyas-wanon kii mor pahadiyon main itihaas-purush chhatrasaal kaa janm hua

 Within five years, he was sent to Delwara to his uncle Saheb Singh Dhandher for war skills training
 mata-pita ke nidhan ke kuch samay pashchaat hi ve bade bhai angad raay ke saath devgarh chale gayi

 Chhatrasal's self-esteem was hurt and he understood the malice of the Mughals and left the army of the Delhi Sultanate

 The power of Chhatrasal increased

 Prannath had given the gift of being a gemstone to this region
 kinvadanti he ki jahaan tak chhatrasaal ke ghode kii taapon ke padchaap bani vah dharaa dhanadhanya, ratna sampann ho gayi
 These lines about the expansion of the vast kingdom of Chhatrasal are repeated with pride- 'it Yamuna Ut Narmada It Chambal Ut Toss Chhatrasal So Laran Ki Rahi Na Kahuhaus
 'chhatrasaal apane samay ke mahaan shoorveer, sanghathak, kushal or pratapi raja the

 His son Hriday Shah also remained indifferent and sat in his manor
 tab chhatrasaal ne bajirao peshwa ko sandesh bheja - Bajirao rushed to the aid along with the army and defeated Bangas on 30 March 1729

 It focuses on married couples
 aaj kal ekal abhibhavak bhi ekal parivaar mana jaataa he
 The term single family The word first appeared in the 20th century
 sanyukt parivaar sadiyon se prachlit hai
 Many people are part of two single families in their life, one is the single family in which they are born and the other is the one in which they get married and settle down

 Sometimes people of many generations live together in the same family

 In joint families family relationships are given more importance than marital relationships

 This system is called patriarchy
 aise gharon main purush pradhan hota he, wo parivaar kaa paalan poshan karata he

 He felt proud for the knowledge tradition of Maharashtra
 erik vulf ne apni prasiddh kriti 'europe and da pipul vidout history' main kaha he ki maanavshaastra itihaas kaa anveshan karata he
 This aspect of the interrelationship of history and anthropology is also well reflected in the writings of Rajwade, the history of Indian marriage-institution and family system and the history of origin and development of Marathas

 Meanwhile, on getting information about some of the sources found by one of his students Kaka Rao Pandit, Rajwade seized those sources and after two months of untiring work, the first volume of the book titled 'sadhane of Maratha History' was published in 1896
 panipat ke yuddh se sambandhit 202 patr isi khand main hai
 With this method of gathering history sources, Rajwade visited the whole of Maharashtra with firm and untiring efforts

 By the time of his death, i

 1926, an even more unpublished collection had been collected near the palace
 in khandon main rajvaade ne deergh prastaavnaayen likhi hai
 Discussing historiography, rational and objective approach to history, he said that history should be written in a scientific manner
 ullekhneey he ki rajvaade ne vanya samaaj or pragaitihaasik samaaj kii sthitiyon kaa vishleshan va aarsh prathaon kaa vivechan karte samay puraanon, shrutiyon, samhitaon, mahabharat tathaa harivansh aadi uplabdh saakshyon ko apane anusandhan kaa aadhaar banaaya
 He believed that history is made by circumstances and human struggles
 usamen ishwariya sanketon athwa ek hi vyakti ke krititv ke bajaay saadhaaran or asaadhaaran vyaktiyon ke jivan-charitra kaa mishran hota he
 Looking at the breadth of history, Rajwade explains that history is the physical and spiritual character of the society of that time
 rajvaade hinduvad ke kaddavar rakshak hone ke saath-saath uske kattar aalochak bhi the
 They considered Hinduism as a socio-economic system
 shivaji jayanti ke avasar par 1911 main tilak ke patr kesari main likhte hue unhone chaaturvarnya vyavastha kaa samarthan kiya or ise saamaajik sanghathan kaa uttam rup batalaaya
 At the same time, he also accused the Marathi society that not following this system properly was the reason for its downfall
 hinduvad athwa brahmanwad kii aad main rajvaade ne hameshaa marathi bhashaa-bhashi logon ke uttardaayitv or kartavyon ko samuhik rup se maharashtra dharm ke rup main vyakt kiya or uski unnati ke liye usapar jor diya
 The palaces did not consider history to be just 'iti-ha-as', that is, what happened
 unki manyata thi ki saidhantik pahaluon se saath itihaas ko samaaj-vigyaan hi mana jaae
 His view corresponds to Hegel's statement that history is expressed in the form of philosophy in its true sense
 rajvaade ne shahji par likhe niabandh main maraathon ke shakti-lop ko punarsthapit karne hetu 'dialactis of difit' arthath haar ke dwandv par charchaa karte hue bataaya ki uttam, sudaul tathaa nishchit hathiyaar banane kii kala ke vikaas ke liye vaigyanik gyaan kii jo purv taiyaari aavashyak hoti he, vah us samay maharashtra main nahin thi
 Attacking the devotional poets, Rajwade said that while thoughtful people like Descartes, Bacon, etc
 in Europe were encouraging those who were exploring various substances in the creation, at the same time saints like Eknath, Tukaram, Dasopant, Nipatniranjan etc
 were here
 Mahatma Panch was trying to show the way to spiritual realization by destroying the Mahabhutas

 The subject of this essay was how these restrictive physical relations developed further

 At the same time, the palaces also show that the genealogy before Prajapati Sanstha was subject to women and the development of Prajapati Sanstha as an ancient Arya Samaj had three consequences
 pehla yah ki prajapati kul kii pruthak rup main sthapana kii prakriya shuru hui
 The second is that the practice of going to distant lands and settling in settlements started
 bahu-bharyak or ekapatik prajapati sanstha main kramagat rup se parivartan shuru hua
 As evidenced in the third chapter of this treatise, 'an Aryan Practice of Hospitality', as described in the forty-fifth chapter of the Udyog Parva of the Mahabharata, 'ishtan Putran Vibhavan Swansch Daran' i

 He said that Indians never believed that there was any breach of morality in giving self-feminine intercourse to one's friend

 At the same time, he has shown the process of historical development of monogamous marriage system in the sexual intercourse of men and women
 is granth main kshepak rup main bhartiya vivaah sanstha ke itihaas vishay par rajvaade dwaara likhit tippaniyan ‘lagnsanstha ’ sheershak ke antargat sammilit kii gayin
 Evaluating the Hindi version of the history of the Indian Institute of Marriage, a reviewer has written that 'many mystics of our renaissance were absorbed in the imagination of the golden world in the distant past
 rajvaade unase bilkul alag the
 In the history of Indian marriage institution, they completely reverse the history hypothesis

 The form of Vedic and pre-vedic societies was something else, not what we fascinated

 Where everything is considered divine and divine, the idea of social system arising from millions of years of struggle and development of human beings may seem strange but palaces take away the land of the ancients

 puraatatv vibhaag ko praapt avasheshon se gyaat jaankaree ke anusaar aabhaaneri gaanv 3000 varsh se bhi adhik purana ho saktaa he, isi gaanv main sthit he "chaand baavdi"
 The initial name of Abhaneri village was "abha Nagari", but later its name was changed to Abhaneri
 chaand baavdi Built in the 9th century, this Bawdi was built by King Mihir Bhoj, and this Bawdi was named Chand Bawdi after him

 chandani raat main ekadam dudhia safed rang kii tarah dikhaai dene vaali yah baavdi andhere-ujaale kii baavdi naam se bhi prasiddh he
 The three-storied Bavdi has a dance hall and a secret tunnel, as well as a later carpet pavilion built in its upper part, which gives evidence of the Bavdi being used for a long time
 isaki tah tak jane ke liye 13 sopan tathaa lagbhag 1300 sidhiyaan banaai gai hai, jo ki kala kaa apratim udhaaharan pesh karti hai
 Surrounded by columnar verandas, this bawdi is square on all sides

 Nowhere in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple has cement and lime been used, which is an excellent example of Indian craftsmanship
 mandir ke thik saamne baavdi hone kaa matlab saafe he ki jo bhi vyakti mandir main pravesh kare, vah pehle apane haath-munh dhoe, uske baad mandir main pravesh kare
 And this is also the culture of our country that whoever enters a religious place, his body and mind should be pure
 kabhi mandir main chah foot kii neelam pathar se bani hui harshad mata kii murti hua karti thi jo ki san 1968 main chori ho gai thi
 Talking to the locals, it is also revealed that the mother used to warn about the impending calamity in the village, which made the locals alert and faced the troubles well

 Bhaskaracharya has discussed permutation in Lilavati's chapter called 'ankapash' At number of places which are filled with equal nymbers of digits, place 1, 2, 3, 4 


 in increasing order
 The product of these digits is the required number of permutations
 Similarly, In the given digits, if some digits are repeated, then at those number of places find number of permutations assuming different digits
 Divide by this number, the number of permutations of all given digits, assuming different digits at all places
 Similarly, Mahaviracharya has given the following formula for the total accumulations of some given items in the Mathematical Collection- in order below; the product in the reverse order is divided by the product in order; is the result
 It is to be noted that many centuries later, in 1634 AD, this is exactly the formula given by Harrigon

 In the second half of the twentieth century, the study of permutation gained momentum and dozens of journals on the subject came into existence and many seminars were held on the subject

 jab november, 1922 main turki main mustafa kamalpasha ne sultan khalipha mohammad chaturth ko padchyut kar abdul majid ko padasin kiya or uske samast raajnneetik adhikaar apahrit kar liye tab khilaafat cameti ne 1924 main virodhapradarshan ke liye ek pratinidhimandal turki bheja
 Mustafa Kemal, a nationalist, completely ignored him and on March 3, 1924, he ended the caliphate
 is prakaar, bharat kaa khilaafat andolan bhi apane aap samaapt ho gaya
 There are two perspectives on why Gandhi started the Khilafat movement in 1920-21: - hinduon ke pramukh granth There are 4 Vedas which are the most ancient and original texts of Hindus
 inhen vishwa ke sabase pracheen sahitya hone kaa gaurav bhi hasil he
 In the past, due to lack of printing facility, the master used to remind his disciples by speaking
 sun kar yaad rakhana or agali peedi ko usee prakaar suna kar unhen dene ke kaaran inkaa naam shruti bhi he
 The 4 Vedas are as follows: -1
 rugveda 2
 Yajurveda 3
 atharvaveda 4
 Like almost all the religious texts of the Samaveda Hindus, they are in Sanskrit
 ye kavy kii tarah do panktiyon main likhe jate hai jinhen shloke kehete hai
 The verses of Rig Veda are called Richa
 upanishdon ko vedon kaa antim bhaag bhi khate hai or isaliye inhen veydant bhi kaha jaataa he
 The basic concept of Vedanta is monotheism

 The Shah Bano case is notorious for creating political controversy in India
 isko aksar rajnatik laabh ke liye alpsankhyak vot bank ke tushtikaran ke udhaaharan ke rup main prastut kiya jaataa he
 Shah Bano was a 62-year-old Muslim woman and mother of five who was divorced by her husband in 1978

 With no means of livelihood for herself and her children, Shah Bano reached the court to support her husband
 ucchtam nyaayalay tak pahonchte maamle ko saat saal biit chuke the
 The court ruled under Section 125 of the Criminal Code, which applies to everyone, regardless of religion, caste or creed
 nyaayalay ne nirdesh diya ki shah bano ko nirvaah-vyay ke samaan jeevika di jaay
 According to the orthodox Muslims of India, this decision was an unauthorized interference in their culture and legislation

 Their leaders and spokespersons were MJ Akbar and Syed Shahbuddin

 1986 main, congress party ne, jise sansad main purna bahumat praapt tha, ek kanoon paas kiya jisane shah bano maamle main ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirnay ko ulat diya
 According to this law: kyonki sarkaar ko purna bahumat praapt tha, ucchtam nyaayalay ke dharm-nirpeksh nirnay ko ulatney vaale, muslim mahila kanoon 1986 aasaani se paas ho gaya
 It is necessary to discuss the reasons and purposes of this law
 kanoon ke varnit prayojan ke anusaar jab ek musalmaan talakshuda mahila iddat ke samay ke baad apana guzaaraa nahin kar sakati he to nyaayalay un sambandhiyon ko use guzaaraa dene kaa aadesh de saktaa he jo musalmaan kanoon ke anusaar uski sampatti ke uttaradhikari hai
 But - if there are no such relatives or they are not in a condition to provide alimony - then the court will order the state waqf board to provide alimony
 is prakaar se pati ke guzaaraa dene kaa uttardaayitv iddat ke samay ke liye simit kar diya gaya

com }} Sunderkand is originally a part of Ramayana written by Valmiki
 goswami tulsidas krit shri ram charit maanas tathaa anya bhashaaon ke ramayana main bhi sundarkand upasthit he
 Sunderkand describes the great deeds done by Hanuman
 ramayana paath main sundarkand ke paath kaa vishesh mahatv mana jaataa he
 In Sunderkand, Hanuman's departure from Lanka, events from Lanka Dahan to return from Lanka come
 is sopan ke mukhya ghatnakram he – hanumanji kaa lanka kii ore prasthaan, vibhishana se bhent, sita se bhent karke unhen shri ram kii mudrika dena, akshay kumaar kaa vadh, lanka dahan or lanka se vaapasi
 The story of Sunderkand is the most different in Ramayana
 sampurna ramayana katha shriram ke gunon or unke purusharth ko darshaati he kintu sundarkand ekmaatr aisa adhyay he, jo sirf hanumanji kii shakti or vijay kaa cond he
 Hanuman left for Lanka
 surasa ne hanuman kii pariksha lee or use yogya tathaa samarthyavan paakar aashirwad diya
 On the way, Hanuman killed the shadow-holding demon and entered Lanka by attacking Lankini
 unki vibhishana se bhent hui
 When Hanuman reached Ashoka Vatika, Ravana was threatening Sita
 ravan ke jane par trijata ne sita ko santvana di
 When he was alone, Hanuman met Sita and gave her Rama's ring
 hanuman ne ashokavatika kaa vidhwans karke ravan ke putr akshay kumaar kaa vadh kar diya
 Meghnath tied Hanuman in Nagpasha and took him to Ravana's assembly
 ravan ke prashn ke uttar main hanuman ne apana parichay ram ke doot ke rup main diya
 Ravana tied a cloth dipped in oil in Hanuman's tail and set it on fire
 On this Hanuman burnt Lanka
 hanuman sita ke paas pahunche
 Sita gave her Chudamani and bade them farewell
 ve waapas samudr paar aakar sabhi vaanron se mili or sabhi waapas sugriv ke paas chale gayi
 Rama was extremely pleased with Hanuman's work
 ram vaanron kii sena ke saath samudratat par pahunche
 On the other hand, Vibhishan explained to Ravana not to hate Rama, but Ravana insulted Vibhishan and expelled him from Lanka
 vibhishana ram ke sharan main aa gaya or ram ne use lanka kaa raja ghoshit kar diya
 Rama begged to give way from the sea
 vinati na maanane par ram ne krodh kiya or unke krodh se bhaybheet hokar samudr ne swayan aakar ram kii vinati karne ke pashchaat nal or nil ke dwaara pul banane kaa upaay bataaya
 Corporate social responsibility is the self-regulation adopted by business and industrial companies under which they operate in accordance with business models that conform to the law, ethical standards, and international norms
 iske antargat company dwaara kuch aise kaary kiye jate hai jo paryaavaran, aam janata, upabhokta, karmchaaree, tathaa anshadhariyon par sakaaratmak prabhaav daale
 Corporate Social Responsibility Corporate self-regulation is a form of integration into a business model
 ek swa niamak tantra he jiske tahat ek vyapaar par nazar rakhata he or kanoon, naitik maanakon or rashtriya yaa antarrashtriya mandandon kii bhaavana ke saath apni sakriy anupaalan sunishchit karata he ke rup main siesaar niti kaary karata he
 The aim is to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions to enhance long-term benefits and shareholder confidence through positive public relations and high ethical standards
 siesaar ranneetiyon paryaavaran or upabhoktaaon, karmchaariyon, niveshkon, samudaayon, or anya logon sahit hitdharakon par sakaaratmak prabhaav banane ke liye company protsaahit karte hai
 Corporations increase long-term profits by working with a CSR perspective
 siesaar ek sanghathan ke mishan sahaayta ke rup main acchhee tarah se kya company apane upabhoktaaon ke liye pratinidhitiv karne ke liye ek guide ke rup main seva karne ke liye sheershak he
 The term "corporate social responsibility" became popular in the 1960s and used indiscriminately by many, legal and moral responsibility remains a term to cover more childishly imposed
 bijness shabdkosh "ke rup main samudaay or paryaavaran main ise sanchalit prati jimmedaari kii company kii bhaavana siesaar ko paribhaashit karata he
 By earning substantial returns on this Citizenship Express programs and employed resources through the company’s educational and social contributions, their waste and pollution reduction processes
 adhikansh upabhoktaaon ko is baat se sahamat hai ki jab vyapaar ke lakshyon ko praapt karne, companiyon ke ek hi samay main siesaar karnaa chahie
 == Customer Approach == Most consumers agree that companies should do CSR at the same time when business objectives are achieved
 Most consumers believe that there will be a positive response for donating companies
 baryaach graahakanna watate kii dengichya companyana sakaaratmak pratisaad denyaat yeil
 samarville yah bhi paaya gaya he ki upabhoktaaon ko vafaadaar or khudara vikritaon he ki daan kaa samarthan par adhik kharch karne ko taiyaar hai
 Somerville has also found that consumers are loyal and retailers who are willing to spend more on donation support
 Consumers, however, believe that environmental efforts are receiving negative feedback, this will have an impact on customer service
 bhi maananaa he ki khudara vikritaon sthaneey utpaadon kii bikri ke prati vafadari hasil hoga
 Although customer efforts receive negative feedback, it is assumed that this will affect customer service
 Although it is believed that loyalty will be gained for the sale of local products
 Not all CSR activities are attractive to consumers
 sarv siesaar upkram graahakanna aakarshak naahit
 Initially, CSR emphasized the official behavior of individual firms
 baad main, yah aapurtikarta vyavhaar or upyog karata he jo karne ke liye utpaadon daal rahe the shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya he or kaise ve ke baad ve mulya kho kaa nipataara kiya gaya
 Irresponsible behavior reflected both on the abuse firm, but also on its corporate clients
 aapurti shrinkhalaa prabandhan siesaar sandarbh vichaar karne ke liye vistaar kiya
 Companies need to include social responsibility in their review of component quality
 siesaar ke ek sanghathan ke maanav sansaadhan, vyavsaay vikaas yaa jansampark vibhaag ke bheetar aadhaar par kiya ja saktaa he, yaa ek alag ikai ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari yaa nideshak mandal ke liye reporting ho saktaa he
 The purpose of a corporation is to maximize the returns that constitute socially responsible behavior to its shareholders and adhere to the rules of the court within which it operates
 jabaki kuch siesaar samarthakon kaa daawa he ki companiyon ko siesaar abhyaas, vishesh rup se vikasshil deshon main kam shramikon or samudaayon, aalochakon kaa daawa he ki siesaar khud apratyaashit parinaamon ke saath sthaneey samudaayon par baahar mulyon lagaataa kaa phayda uthaane kii sambhaavna he
 Better government regulation and enforcement, rather than voluntary measures that move from the public to decision making and allocation of resources to private bodies are an alternative to CSR
 haalanki, aalochakon kaa daawa he ki prabhavi siesaar svaichhik anivaary saamaajik jimmedaari ke kaaryakramon viniyamit rup se sarkaar logon kii apni yojanaon or praathamiktaaon ke saath hastkshep sansadhano ke aavanton ko vikrut, or gaiyr jimmedaar nirnyon kii sambhaavna bad jaati hona chahie
 Some critics believe that CSR programs are carried out by companies to distract the public from ethical questions arising from their core functions
 unka tark he ki pratishtha laabh he ki siesaar companiyon praapt drushtikon ke paakhand kaa pradarshan
 Another concern is that sometimes companies use CSR to direct public attention away from other harmful business practices
 is tarah ke tambaakoo, sharaab yaa ladaai ke saamaan companiyon ke rup main udyogon ke utpaadon he ki apane upabhoktaaon or / yaa paryaavaran ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Such companies may engage in the same philanthropic activities as those in other industries
 is dwandv siesaar ke sambandh main aisi companiyon ke akalan pechida ho
 Corporate people have little or no conscience or care or sympathy, it is logical that they are not motivated by any notion of social responsibility and commitment to employees or to the wider public
