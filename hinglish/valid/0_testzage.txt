 When a party fails to put one of its pieces, crossing the opposition's gate, into the next house and does not pick up the opposition's ball, the opposition can punish it
 ise 'hafing' bhi kehete hai
 It then depends on the will of the opposition to pick up the goat as a punishment for which his own goat should have been imprisoned, or to return his move to that party, again by doing the same trick to make his goate captive
 Force him to do whatever he deems fit for his interest
 gyatavya he ki is khel main kabhi-kabhi vijayi hone ke nimitt apni hi got ko vipakshi dwaara bandi banavaa lenaa bhi aavashyak ho jaataa he
 When a party captures all the gotos of the opposition or blocks the path of those goats in such a way that it is forced and cannot move any further, then that side is considered a victory
 jab koi paksh vijayshri na praapt kar sake or khel kii sthiti kuch is prakaar kii ho jaay jisase yah spasht ho jaay ki aage nirnay ho sakna asambhav he, to us baaji ko anirnit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he

 The nephron, the urine-producing functional structures of the kidney, extends from the bark to the marrow

 The kidneys participate in homeostasis of the entire body by controlling acid-base balance, electrolyte concentration, extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure
 gurde in homeostatic kaaryon ko swatantra rup se va anya angon, vishishtatah antahsravi tantra ke angon, ke saath milakar, donon hi prakaar se purna karte hai
 The fulfillment of these endocrine functions requires synergies between various endocrine hormones, including renin, angiotensis II, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, and articular natriuretic peptide, etc
 gurde ke kaaryon main se anek kaary nefron main hone vaale parishodhan, punarvasoshana or srav kii apekshaakrit saral karypranaliyon ke dwaara purna kiye jate hai
 Refining, which occurs in the renal corpuscle, is a process by which cells and large proteins are filtered from the blood and an ultrafiltrate is formed, which will eventually form urine
 The kidneys produce 180 liters of ultrafiltrate a day, a large percentage of which is regenerated and about 2 liters of urine is produced
 is ultraphiltret se rakt main anuon kaa parivahan punarvasoshana kehalaata he
 The secretion is its reverse process, in which molecules are sent in the opposite direction, from blood to urine
 car ke apshisht padaarth utsarjit karte hai
 These include nitrogen-rich waste urea produced from protein catabolism and uric acid from the metabolism of nucleic acids
 plasma parasaraniyata main kisi bhi ullekhneey vruddhi yaa giravat kii pahchaan hypothelemus dwaara kii jaati he, jo sidhe pichhali shleshmiya granthi se samvaad karata he
 When osmolality increases, this gland secretes the antidiuretic hormone ADH, resulting in water reabsorption by the kidneys and increased urine concentration
 ye donon kaarak ek saath kaary karke plasma kii parasaraniyata ko punah saamaanya staron par laate hai
 ADH attaches to the main cells located in the collecting duct, which transports aquaporin to the marrow, so that water can normally release the impermeable marrow, and it can be reabsorbed into the body by the vasa reacta, which increases the amount of plasma in the body
 is
 aisi do pranaliyaan hai, jo atiparasarniya majja kaa nirmaan karti hai or is prakaar sharir main plasma kii maatra ko badhaati hai: uria punarchakran tathaa ‘ekal prabhaav 
' Urea is usually excreted from the kidneys as a waste material
 haalanki, jab plasma rakt-maatra kam hoti he or adiech choda jaataa he, to isse khulne vaale equaporins bhi uria ke prati bhedya hote hai
 This allows urea to form a hyperosmotic solution that 'attracts' water by leaving a hyper collecting tube and entering the medulla
 iske baad uria nefron main punah pravesh kar saktaa he or is aadhaar par ise punah utsarjit yaa punarchakrit kiya ja saktaa he ki adiech abhi bhi upasthit he yaa nahin
 The 'single effect' describes the fact that the thick ascending limb of the Loops of Henley is not permeable by water, but is permeable by earth
 iskaa arth yah he ki ek prati-pravaahee pranali nirmit hoti he, jiske dwaara majja adhik sandrit ban jaati he or yadi adiech dwaara sangrahan nalika ko khol diya gaya ho, to jal ke ek parasaraniyata anupaat dwaara iskaa anupaalan kiya janaa chaiye
 Long-term blood pressure control is mainly dependent on the kidneys
 mukhyatah aisa koshiketar drav upkhand ke anurakshan ke madhyam se hota he, jiskaa aakar plasma sodium sandrata par nirbhar karata he
 However, the kidneys cannot directly estimate blood pressure, but changes in the delivery of sodium and chloride to the distal parts of the nephron alter the secretion of the renal fermentin used by the kidney
 jab koshiketar drav upkhand vistaarit ho or raktchaap ucch ho, to in yanon kii supurdagee bad jaati he or renin kaa srav ghat jaataa he
 Similarly, when the extracellular fluid subdivision is compressed and blood pressure is low, the delivery of sodium and chloride decreases and the renin secretion increases in response
 renin un rasinic sandeshvaahakon kii shrinkhalaa kaa pehla sadsy he, jo milakar renin-angiotencin tantra kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Changes in renin eventually alter the output of this mechanism, mainly angiotensin II and aldosteron
 prayek hormone anek karypranaliyon ke madhyam se kaary karata he, lekin donon hi gurde dwaara kiye jane vaale sodium chloride ke avasorana ko badhaate hai, jisase koshiketar drav upkhand kaa vistaar hota he or raktchaap badhata he
 When renin levels are increased, the concentration of angiotensin II and aldosterone increases, resulting in increased reabsorption of sodium chloride, expansion of extracellular fluid subdivision, and increased blood pressure
 iske vipareet, jab renin ke str nimna hote hai, to angiotencin II or eldosteron ke str ghat jate hai, jisase koshiketar drav upkhand kaa sankuchan hota he or raktchaap main kami aati he
 The kidneys secrete a variety of hormones, including erythropoietin, calcitriol, and renin

 It catalyzes erythropoiesis in the bone marrow
 calcetriol, vitamin di kaa utprerit rup, calcium ke antra avasorana tathaa phosphate ke vrikkeey punarvasoshana ko protsaahit karata he
 Renin, which is part of the renin – angiotensin – aldosteron mechanism, is an enzyme involved in the control of aldosteron levels
 stanpayi jeevon main gurde kaa vikaas madhyavarti mesoderm se hota he
 The development of the kidney, also known as nephrogenesis, passes through three successive stages, each of which is marked by the development of a more advanced pair of kidneys: pronephros, mesonephros and metanephros
 vibhinn jaanwaron ke gurde vikasaatmak anukulan ke pramaanon ko pradarshit karte hai or lambey samay se unka adhyayan paristhitiki-sharir vigyaan tathaa tulanaatmak sharir vigyaan main kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Kidney morphology, often listed as marrow thickening, is related to the dryness of the natural habitat in species of mammal organisms
 gurde se judi chikitsiya shabdaawaliyaan aamtaur par vrikkeey jaise shabdon tathaa nefro- upsarg kaa prayog karti hai
 The adjective renal, which means, related to renal, is derived from the Latin word renes, meaning kidney; The prefix nephro- is derived from the ancient Greek word nephros) used for the kidneys
 udhaaharan ke liye, shalyachikitsa ke dwaara gurde ko nikaal dena nefrectomi kehalaata he, jabaki gurde ke kaary main kami ko vrikkeey dushkriya kehete hai
 In general, humans can survive normally even with only one kidney because the number of renal tissues in each is more than the number required to survive
 gurde kii dirghakaalin bimaariyaan keval tabhi viksit hongi, jab gurde ke kaaryaatmak utakon kii maatra bahut adhik ghat jaae

 In most vertebrate organisms, mesonephros is transformed into an adult kidney, although it is often associated with more advanced metanephroses; In amniote only the mesonephros is restricted to the embryo
