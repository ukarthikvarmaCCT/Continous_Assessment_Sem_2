 In the western United States, the insect called Prionus californicus was beloved due to its large size
 keet kabhi-kabhi kachche bhi khaae jate hai
 But mostly they make different types of dishes
 anek keet apane pankhons ko pair se ragadkar, jhilliyon athwa pankhons ko compit kar, yaa kisi anya prakaar se dhwani paidaa karte hai
 The question arises whether this type of sound is called music? Entomologist calls it Jhankar, or stridylation or latent pronunciation

 Transformation is the transition chain from ovum to pupa and pupa becoming adults
 keval kuch virgon or bahut kam jatiyon ko chhodkar roopantaran sabhi kiton ke jivan kii ek pramukh visheshta he
 There are three basic principles of conversion: growth, piercing, and reproduction
 vruddhi dimbh or ninf se, bhedikaran pupa athwa roopantaran se, tathaa prajnan vayask se sambandhit hote hai
 Development from egg to adult is gradual
 1
 anda, 2-6
 arbhak avasthaa, 7 vayask
 There is also a development in the life of the insect, which is clear and different from other times
 inhen avasthaaen kehete hai
 Fully transformed insects have egg stage, pupation and adult stage
 ye avasthaaen phir instaron main banti hai, jinaki visheshta mukhon main hoti hai
 Every time a release or a new form is formed in an infant, there is a clear change in their shape
 parivartan praaia: ek instar se prarambh hokar baad ke instar main puraa hota he
 There is also a difference from one form to another
 dimbh prayek rup ke kaal main bhojan aatmsaat karata he, kintu pratyaksh vruddhi puraani dimbhavstha ke nirmochan ke baad hi hoti he
 Adult development occurs in color and the insect is mature
 akruti or rachana ke parivartan ke saath-saath uske bhojan or swabhaav main bhi parivartan hota he
 There is a close relationship between the nature of the insect and the change of food
 lepidoptera ke adhiktar dimbh vanaspatibhoji hote hai, kintu vayask makrand chuusate hai yaa niraahaar rahete hai
 Baby hymenoptera feed on different types of food
 shishu dimak lakdi, munh se ugala hua yaa malashay se niklaa hua padaarth, visarjeet twachaa or laar ityadi khate hai
 Nymphs first eat saliva, then abdominal food and finally eat wood
 vayask kiton main aahaar kii vruddhi kadachit hi hoti he or andon main bahut hi kam
 Growth occurs in all stages of insect life
 kiton main avyask avasthaa khaane or vruddhi karne kii hoti he or unke jivan kaa adhikansh bhaag vruddhi or vikaas main bitta he
 In general, the growth of the insect is rapid
 adhikansh jatiyaan ek saal main hi puure aakaar kii ho jaati hai or bahut si kuch hi saptahon main
 Like other animals, the growth in insect is not gradual and continuous
 dimbh athwa shishu bhojan karata he or badhata he
 As a result, its skin is curved very strongly
 is bich puraani twachaa ke neeche ek nai twachaa taiyaar ho jaati he
 Release fluid is produced between the new and old skin, which dissolves the old skin and helps to separate it from the body
 yathochit samay par sir ke sameep prishthbhag main twachaa fat jaati he or keet apni puraani twachaa se rengkar baahar chalaa aata he
 The new skin tightens soon after twinkling
 rang nikhar jaataa he or keet duusari baar bhojan karne par vruddhi ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he
 This action is called twinkling
 puraani twachaa ko, jo alag ho jaati he, nirmoke kehete hai
 The period between twinkling is called stodium and this stage insect is called instar
 tvagmochan kii kriya bahut hi sookshm hoti he or is samay kaa keet praaia: niskriy, asahaay or kisi prakaar kii kshati ke prati teevr anubhutisheel hota he
 There are three categories of insecticide, recurrence, spontaneity and intelligence: kiton par vaataavaran kaa lagaataar prabhaav padataa he
 They are sensitive to it directly or indirectly
 in samvednaaon kii abhikriya ko aavartana athwa tropotaxes, kehete hai
 Occurrence is rarely individual
 kisi prakaar ke rasayan ke prati kiton kii abhikriya ko rasinic aavartana, sparshasamvednaa ke prati sparshavartana, jaldharak ke prati sravavartana, jal ke prati jalavartana, vidyuddharaon ke prati anilavartana, gurutvkarshan ke prati bhumyavartana, prakaash ke prati prakaashavartana, ushnata ke prati tapavartana kehalaati he
 Being sensitive to one or many sensations of an organism is called instinct
 sahajavrittiwali kriyaaon ke antargat niamak parivarti kriyaayein or aavartan kii jatil shrinkhlaayein hoti hai
 An example of this is the irreversibility of Pearis Brassicki's nature in India

 At the end of April, they were flying in the direction of thousands of snowy peaks per minute, where they must have died
 koi samaj nahin paata ki koun si shakti in titliyon ko vinaash kii ore prerit karti hai
 In fact, they do not foresee this apocalypse
 usee prakaar deshaantaran karti hui tiddiyaan kisi prakaar ke avrodh kii parvaah nahin karatin
 The conclusion is that insects are unfit to adapt to the condition of inactivation
 yadhyapi keet kuch krityon athwa chayachitron ko yaad rakhanevaale prathit hote hai, kintu ve swechha se pun: samaran karne main asamarth hote hai
 Therefore, they do not have the ability to reason or understand
 kitsangh kisi ek vishesh jati kaa yaa jatiyon kaa ho saktaa he
 This type of association can go dormant or active and can last for a fraction of the insect life, or throughout its life
 niskriy kitsangh-bahudhaa tarang, jowar bhaata athwa hawa ke pravaah ke saath keet badi sankhya main kisi sthaan par ikattha ho jate hai
 This type of coagulation can often be destructive to some species of insects, but is beneficial as food for other animals
 sakriy saahchary-bhojan, maithun, nidra, daleey udaan, sthanantaran, greeshmakaleen niskriyata athwa sheetakaaleen niskriyata, chote athwa bade dal main kiton ke ekatra hone ke kaaran ho sakate hai
 Those insects which live in a union or society, but are not really social, are called Uetchar
 greeshmanishkriy athwa sheetanishkriy saahchary-bahut se kaaran, jaise surakshit sthaan kaa chunaav, kiton, jaise indragop, ko greeshmanishskriy hone, pupa banane athwa niskriyata ke liye baadhya karte hai
 Different groups vary in nature

 In most English-speaking countries outside of North America, its more common name is biscuits, with both names being used in many regions, while elsewhere the meanings of the two words are different
 scotland main ek saadi pav roti ko kuki kaha jaataa he, jabaki sanyukt rajya america main ek tikia jaisi quick bread ko biscuit kaha jaataa he
 In Britain, cooked biscuits are called cookies, which mostly contain pieces of chocolate
 iskaa naam dach bhashaa ke koeke yaa koki se liya gaya he jiskaa arth he chota kek, or yah uttari america ke dach logon ke madhyam se angreji bhashaa main liya gaya he
 Cookies are usually cooked until crisp or soft, but some varieties of cookies are not cooked at all
 Cookies are prepared using various methods with the help of a mixture of ingredients such as sugar, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, walnuts or dry fruits
 kuki kaa naram hona is baat par nirbhar kar saktaa he ki ise kitni der tak pakaaya gaya he
 Thus a general theory of cookies can be formulated
 kek or anya mithi bread se judi hone ke baavjood, lagbhag sabhi kismon kii kukies main saamagree milaane ke liye pani kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa
 kek main pani kaa prayog, mul mishran ko, jitna ho sake, utana patala banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, jisase bulbule banate hai-jo kek ke phoolne ke liye jimmedaar hai-taaki badhiya kek taiyaar ho sake
 a medium of mixing the ingredients in a cookie is a type of oil

 That is why cake made of butter or eggs instead of water is more hard after removing from oven
 kek ko antim swarup dene main, pake hue kek main tel kaa utana yogadan nahin hota jitna ki soda kaa hota he
 Instead of evaporating and thickening the mixture, it forms bubbles of the escaping gases that are produced by the small amount of water found in the eggs and the carbon dioxide produced by heating the baking powder

 Cookie-like hard wafers are described in pieces almost since the time of cooking, as they were very useful during travel, but they were not usually so sweet that they could be called cookie by modern standards

 Cookies arrived in the Americas during the beginning of the British settlement, although they received the name "koake" from the Dutch people

 Cookies are broadly divided into at least the following categories based on how they are made: kukies ko vishesh rup se chocolate ke tukdon yaa milti julati kanfectionari se bhi sajaayaa ja saktaa he
 Flour, semi-solid fat, baking powder or soda, milk and sugar are used to make a simple biscuit
 aam taur par swaadisht banane ke liye chini ke sthaan par paneer yaa anya deyari utpaadon jaisi samagriyon kaa prayog hota he
 Shortbread is a popular biscuit in the UK

 The five sons born to them by the Pandavas were known as up-pandavas
 pracheen bharat ke mahakavy mahabharat ke anusaar draupadi kaa janm maharaj drupad ke yahan yajyakund se hua tha
 Therefore, it was also called 'yagyaseni'

 She told Shankar five times that she wanted an all-encompassing husband
 shankar ne kaha ki agle janm main uske paanch bharatvanshi pati honge, kyonki usne pati paane kii kaamana paanch baar dohraayi thi
 When the education of Pandava and Kaurava princes was completed, they wanted to give Guru Dakshina to Dronacharya
 dronacharya ko drupad ke dwaara kiye gayi apane apmaan kaa samaran ho aayaa or unhone rajkumaron se kaha, "rajkumaron! yadi tum gurudakshina dena hi chaahate ho to paanchal naresh drupad ko bandi bana kar mere samaksh prastut karo
 This will be your Gurudakshina
 " gurudev ke is prakaar kehane par samast rajkumaar apane-apane astr-shastr le kar paanchal desh kii ore chale
 On reaching Panchal, Arjuna said to Dronacharya, "gurudev! You first allow the Kauravas to fight with King Drupada
 yadi ve drupad ko bandi banane main asafal rahe to ham pandav yuddh karenge
 "on getting the permission of the Guru, the Kauravas led by Duryodhana attacked Panchal
 donon pakshon ke madhya bhayankar yuddh hone laga kintu ant main kaurav parrast ho kar bhaag nikle
 Seeing the Kauravas fleeing, the Pandavas started the attack
 bhimsen tathaa arjuna ke parakram ke samaksh paanchal naresh kii sena haar gai
 Arjuna went ahead and made Drupada a prisoner and brought it to Guru Dronacharya
 drupad ko bandi ke rup main dekh kar dronacharya ne kaha, "he drupad! ab tumhaare rajya kaa swami main ho gaya hoon
 i came to you as a friend, but you did not accept me as your friend
 ab bataao kya tum meri mitrataa sweekaar karte ho?" drupad ne lajja se sir jhukaa liya or apni bhul ke liye kshamayachna karte huye bole, "he dron! aapako apana mitra na maananaa meri bhul thi or uske liye ab mere hriday main pashchaatap he
 Both i and my kingdom are now subject to you, now do whatever you wish
 " dronacharya ne kaha, "tumne kaha tha ki mitrataa samaan varg ke logon main hoti he
 Therefore, i am returning half of your kingdom to you in order to maintain a friendly spirit with you
 " itnaa kah kar dronacharya ne ganga nadi ke dakshini tat kaa rajya drupad ko saunp diya or shesh ko swayan rakh liya
 After being defeated by Guru Drona, Maharaj Drupada was extremely ashamed and started thinking of a way to let him down in some way
 isi chintaa main ek baar ve ghoomte huye kalyani nagari ke brahmanon kii basti main ja pahunche
 There he met the great Karmakandi Brahmin brothers named Yaz and Upayaj
 raja drupad ne unki seva karke unhen prasann kar liya evam unase dronacharya ke maarane kaa upaay poocha
 On his asking, elder brother Yaj said, "for this you please Agnidev by organizing a huge yajna so that he will give you the gift of that great powerful son
 " maharaj ne yaaj or upyaaj se unke kahe anusaar yajna karavaaya
 Pleased with his sacrifice, Agnidev gave him a son who was full of weapons and armor

 As soon as she was born, there was an All India Radio that this girl was born for the destruction of the Kshatriyas and the destruction of the Kauravas
 balak kaa naam dhridhyumna evam balika kaa naam krishna rakhaa gaya
 "I am coming from Panchal, the city of Maharaj Drupada
 vahaan par drupad kii kanya draupadi ke swayamvar ke liye anek deshon ke raja-maharaja padhaare huye hai
 " vedavyas-tum log paanchal chale jaao
 There Drupada is going to be the swayamvara of Virgo Panchali

 That devaswarpa girl is worthy of you all the same
 tum log vahaan ja kar use praapt karo
 The king-maharaja and Prince of many countries were present in the Swayamvara Sabha, soon after, Princess Draupadi arrived in that meeting with her brother Dhrishtadyumna in hand
 dhridhyumna ne sabha ko sambodhit karte huye kaha, "vibhinn desh se padhaare raja-maharaajaaon evam anya ganmaanya jano se meri bahan draupadi kaa vivaah hoga
 " ek ke baad ek sabhi raja-maharaja evam rajkumaron ne ek upar gumti hui machhlee kii aankh pra uske pratibimb ko neeche jal main dekhakar nishaanaa saadhane kaa prayaas kiya kintu safalataa haath na lagi or ve kantiheen hokar apane sthaan main laut aaye
 These unsuccessful people included Jarasandha, Shalya, Shishupala and Duryodhana, Kauravas etc
 kauravon ke asafal hone par karn ne nishaanaa saadhane ke liye jaise hi dhanush uthaaya ,tabhi draupadi ne shri krishna ke ishaare par karn ko sut putr kahkar vivaah ke liye manaa kar diya 
 Then the princess wanted to receive a Brahmin on the orders of Shri Krishna
 arjuna ne tailpaatr main pratibimb ko dekhte huye ek hi baan se nishaanaa laga daalaa
 Draupadi went ahead and put varmala on Arjun's neck
 ek brahman ke gale main draupadi ko varmala daalate dekh samast kshatriya raja-maharaja evam rajkumaron ne krodhit ho kar arjuna par akraman kar diya
 a fierce battle ensued between the Pandavas and the Kshatriya kings
 pandav draupadi ko saath le kar vahaan pahunche jahaan ve apni mata kunti ke saath nivas kar rahe the
 Arjun called out from the gate and said to his mother, "mother! Today we have come with a wonderful begging for you
 " us par kunti ne bheetar se hi kaha, "putron! tum log aapas main mil-baant uskaa upbhog kar lo
 "later on knowing that the beggar was in the form of a bride, Kunti was deeply repentant but Draupadi accepted the five Pandavas as her husband to prove the mother's words to be true
 pandavon ke draupadi ko saath le kar apane nivas par pahunchne ke kuch kaal pashchaat unke peeche-peeche krishna bhi vahaan par aa pahunche
 After the formalities were completed, Kunti said to Draupadi, "draupadi! First take out the parts of the gods
 phir brahmanon ko do
 Then separate the fraction of dependents
 uske baad jo shesh bache uskaa aadha bhaag bhim ko or shesh aadha bhaag ham sabhi ko apni deh paroso

 sukhsagar ke saujany se The computer only understands binary signals ie 0 and 1
 masini bhashaa ke atirikt anya sabhi programing bhashaao main 0 or 1 ke atirikt anya ank va aksharo kaa prayog hota he
 The translator translates these digits and letters into binary signals so that they understand the instructions given in the computer and analyze them accordingly to produce the correct result

 Therefore, a high level programming language in which the compiler is used, after writing the program, the program is loaded into the compiler whereas when writing the program in the language in which the interpreter is to be used, the interpreter is loaded before writing the program
 goes
 ’si’ bhashaa main compiler or basic main interprator kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 In the Unix operating system, mainly Vi editors and ededitors are used to write programs in C
 koi bhi sanchika jiskaa vistaarit naam ’si’ he vah sanchika si program ke naam se jaani jaati he
 In Unix, there are two methods to create a program file of 'C' programming language - dos main ’si’ bhashaa main program likhane ke liye copycon commond athwa kisi bhi dos editor kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 It is compiled after writing the program
 mukhyat: unics main ANSI compiler kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Whereas any 'C' compiler is used in DOS

 Although these provisions were in opposition to habeas corpus, there is still debate on whether the president has the right to detain a suspected terrorist indefinitely

 Under the MCA, this law prohibits habeas corpus appeals only for foreigners who are barred as "enemy combatants", or who are in the process of making such a determination
 us praavdhaan ko aparivartit rakhaa gaya he jisamen kaha gaya he ki aise nirdhaaran ke baad yah america nyaayalay main apil ke adheen he, jisamen shaamil he is baat kii samiksha ki kya saboot nirdhaaran ko nyaaysangat tehraate hai
 If the situation is upheld, their imprisonment is deemed valid
 haalanki, koi kanoonee samay seemaa nahin he jo sarkaar ko ek combatant states rivyu tribunel sunwaayee pradaan karne ke liye majaboor kare
 CSRT sunwaayee se pehle, kaidiyon ko kisi bhi adaalat main kisi bhi kaaran se yachika daayar karne se kanoonee rup se pratibandhit kiya gaya he
 On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Gonzalez stated in Senate testimony that while habeas corpus is "our most cherished right," the US Constitution does not explicitly guarantee habeas corpus rights to US citizens or residents
 vaise, is kanoon ko america nagarikon tak vistaarit kiya ja saktaa he or agar aniyantrit chhod diya jaae to rakhaa ja saktaa he
 As Robert Parry writes in the Baltimore Chronicle and Sentinel: Ironically, Gonzales may be wrong in another way about the lack of specificity in the Constitution’s granting of habeas corpus rights
 Many of the legal features attributed to habeas corpus are delineated in a positive way in the Sixth Amendment


 To date, there is at least one confirmed case in which non-us citizens were misclassified as enemy combatants
 7 june 2007 ko, bandi pratyakshikaran bahaali adhinium 2007 ko party linon ke saath vibhajit 11-8 vot se seenet dwaara anumodith kiya gaya, jahaan sirf ek republican mat ko chhodkar sabhi samarthan main pade

 " 21 janvari 2009 ko, america raashtrapati baraak obama ne guantanamo be nausena adde or vahaan niruddh kiye gaye vyaktiyon ke sambandh main ek kaaryakari aadesh jari kiya
 The order said that "the close captive is the constitutional prerogative of the State"
 bandi pratyakshikaran ek karrwai he jo praayah ek aise prativaadee dwaara sazaa ke baad kii jaati he jo apane aapraadhik mukademe main kuch kathith truti ke kaaran raahat ke liye prayasarat ho
 is tarah kii kai mukadmaa-pashchaat kriyaayein or kaarywahi hai, jinke matbhed sambhavit rup se bhramit karne vaale hote hai, isliye inamen kuch spashtikaran kii zarurat hoti hai
 Some of the most common are an appeal in which the defendant has the right to induce a confession, a quorum nobis order and a habeas corpus
 ek apil, jiskaa adhikaar prativaadee ke paas he use adaalat dwaara sankshipt nahin kiya ja saktaa he jo, apane kshetradhikaar ke abhidaan se, apil sunne ke liye badhyakaari he
 In such an appeal, the applicant feels that there must have been some error in his suit, which necessitates an appeal
 vah aadhaar ek mahatv kaa mudda he jis par is tarah kii ek apil ko daayar kiya ja saktaa he: aam taur par adhikaar ke maamle ke taur par apilen keval un muddon ko uthaa sakati hai jo mul rup se mukademe ke dauraan uthaaye gaye the 
 koi bhi mudda jo mul rup se mukademe main nahin uthaaya gaya, us par apil main vichaar nahin kiya jaayegaa or use vibandhan mana jayega
 trutiyon ke aadhaar par ek yachika ke safal hone kii sambhaavna he yaa nahin yah jaanane ke liye ek suvidhajanak pareekshan he yah pushti karnaa kii ek galati vastav main hui thi vakil dwaara us galati ke liye aapatti prastut kii gai thi or is galati ne prativaadee ke mukademe ko nakaaratmak rup se prabhavit kiya
 The trial order, generally known only as cert, is an order by the High Court directing the lower court to send a case for record review and in the post-litigation process it The next rational step is
 jabaki rajyon main isi tarah kii prakriyaayein hoti hogi, cert kaa ek pradesh aamtaur par keval, sanyukt rajya america main supreme court dwaara jari kiya jaataa he, yadhyapi kuch rajya is prakriya ko banaae rakhte hai
 Contrary to the above appeal, a court of cert is not a subject of authority
 cert ke ek pradesh ke liye yachika daayar kerani padati he, kyonki ucch nyaayalay is prakaar ke pradesh ko bandhan ke anusaar simit aadhaar par jari karata he jaise samay
 ek or arth main, cert kaa pradesh apni simaaon main ek apil kii tarah hota he; isamen bhi mul mukademe main uthaae gaye aadhaaron par anutosh kii maang kii ja sakati he
 a petition for quorum nobis territories is a post-judgment attack on the outcome of the case
 yah nichali adaalat main diya jaataa he or daawa karata he ki vahaan kuch galtiyaan thim jisase adaalat ko us faisle or / yaa sajaa ko darkinar karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 The use of quorum nobis orders varies from one jurisdiction to another
 haalanki, adhikansh adhikaar kshetron main yah un sthitiyon tak simit he jahaan ek sidhi apil pehle sambhav nahin thi - aamtaur par isliye kyonki vah mudda apil ke samay agyaat tha yaa isliye kyonki us mudde ko prakriyaatmak baadhaon ke kaaran apil par anyathaa uthaaya nahin ja sakaa
 korum nobis yachikaaon ke liye ek aam aadhaar he vakil se mili aksham sahaayta kaa daawa jahaan kathith aakshamata ko adaalat ke ricard par nahin dikhaaya jaataa he
 In such cases, a direct appeal is generally impossible because important events do not appear on the record where the appellate court can see them
 is prakaar, ek twarit korum nobis yachika upyog karne ke liye prativaadee ke liye ek mahatvapurn saadhan ho saktaa he
 The habeas corpus order is often the last chance for a defendant to be satisfied with his wrongful conviction
 bandi pratyakshikaran ko prayog kiya ja saktaa he yadi ek prativaadee apni apil ke nattejey se asantusht he or use cert ke pradesh se inkaar kar diya gaya he, jis bindu par vah bandi pratyakshikaran ke pradesh ke liye vibhinn adaalaton main se kisi ek main yachika daayar kar saktaa he
 In this also, they are given at the discretion of the court and a petition is required
 apil yaa cert ke pradesh kii tarah, ek bandi pratyakshikaran pradesh, mul mukademe main kuch truti dekhte hue ek prativaadee kii galat sajaa ko palat saktaa he
 The major difference is that the habeas corpus order can, and often does, focus on issues that are outside the original range of the lawsuit, that is, issues that could not be raised by appeal or cert
 These often fall under two rational categories of whether the trial counsel was ineffective or incompetent or that some constitutional right was violated
 jaise-jaise ek vyakti mukademe-pashchaat kii karravaayiyon main aage badhata he, anutosh uttarottar adhik asambhavit hota jaataa he
 Knowing the differences between these actions and the intention to use them is an important tool in increasing the likelihood of obtaining a favorable judgment for yourself
 isliye ek vakil kaa prayog aksar ek uchit vichaar hota he taaki jo vyakti mukademe-pashchaat ke ek jatil paridrishy ko paar karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai unhen madad mil sake
 This article is not about Sanskrit Mahakavi Bhasa's work 'dootavakya'
 dootkavy, sanskrit kavy kii ek vishisht parampara he jiskaa aarambh bhaas tathaa ghatkarper ke kaavyon or mahakavi kalidas ke meghdoot main miltaa he, tathaapi, iske beej or adhik puraane prathit hote hai
 The passage described by Valmiki in the poems in which Rama sent his viraha message to Sita is considered to be the beginning link of this tradition
 swayan kalidas ne bhi apane "meghdoot" main is baat kaa sanket kiya he ki unhen megh ko doot banane kii prerana valmiki "ramayana" ke hanumanvaale prasang se mili he
 On the other hand, the seeds of this tradition also appear to be located in folklore, where the Virhi and the Virhinis plead to carry the message by birds of their loving relatives, Bhramar, Shuk, Chatak, Kak etc
 "ghatkarper" kavy main keval 22 padya uplabdh hai, jinamein akaash main ghire megh ko dekhakar ek virahinee ne apane virah kii vyanjana karai he
 The other characteristic of this poetry is the use of padanta yamaka ornamentation with paraphrasing
 shailicilp kii drushti se yah ati laghu kavy bhi sanskrit sahitya main apana vishisht sthaan bana chukaa he or kaha jaataa he ki is kriti ke saundarya ke karan kavi ne anya kaviyon ko yah chunauti di thi ki jo bhi kavi isse adhik utkrisht rachana kar degaa, rachayita uske ghar phute ghade se pani bharne ko taiyaar he
 Due to this pledge, the title of the author became "ghatkarpar" and we do not know his real name
 kuch vidvan is rachana ko kalidas krit maanate hai, kintu yah siddh ho chukaa he ki yah kalidas kii rachana nahin he
 The time of "ghatkarpar" is an indefinite one, as according to early tradition, "ghatkarpar" was also one of Vikramaditya's Navratnas
 keval itnaa kaha ja saktaa he ki is kavy k rachana kalidas se puraani he
 The powerful work of this tradition is the "meghdoot" of Mahakavi Kalidasa, in which the Yaksha, exiled by Kubera to Mount Ramagiri, through his unconscious cloud sends a message to his Priya in distant Alakapuri that he is somehow of the exile period
 Let the rest of the month pass and then they will fulfill all their aspirations in the dusty nights with the moonlight of Sharad
 dootkavy yaa sandeshkavy kii parampara ko aage badhaane main anek sanskrit kaviyon ne mahatvapurn yoga diya he

 samgr kavyakruti ke rup main madhya bhartiya aryabhasha ke sahitya main keval ek kriti aisi he, jo meghdoot kii parampara main aati he or yah he apbhransh kavi uddahamaan kaa "sandeshraasak"
 In the 12th century Adhmana, a weaver from Multan, composed a poem in the style of Rasak Gitikavya in which the Virahini heroine begs a wanderer to carry a message to her beloved on her way to Khambhat
 is kavy main nayika ke saundaryavarnan ke atirikt romantic shadritu varnan or nayika kii virahadasha kii maarmik abhivyanjana uplabdh he
 In Hindi, "dhola Maru Ra Duha", there are some couplets, whose form is of the messenger style
 iske atirikt hindi premakhyaan kaavyon main aise sthal uplabdh hai, jahaan virahi pranayi ne apane priy ke prati kisi madhyam se sandesh pahunchaane kii cheshtaa kii he
 In this connection, some of the available sites can be indicated in Jayasi's "nagamtivirah narration"
 isi tarah hindi krishnakavy main bhramaragit parampara ke antargat dootkavy yaa sandeshkavy ke kuch beej mil jaayenge
 The style of Dootkavya or Sandeshkavya in Malayalam originates from the "neelkanthsandesh" of Kerala Varma, who sent a message from prison to his wife via Neelkanth

 Karl Fokers of Merck Pharma, known as the father of coenzyme Q-10 research is
 karl ne uskaa naam koenzim kyuu-10 rakhaa gaya kyonki usamen ek quinon naam kaa challa tha jisase das isoprin parshv laden judi hui thi
 These days, Dr
 RA Morton of England and his colleagues also isolated coq-10 from mitochondria and named it ubiquinone as it was found in all the cells of the body

 haalaanki china, bharat, dakshini korea or italy bhi iskaa utpaan karte hai
 Nowadays it is also being produced in Pasadena, Texas, USA
 hamaare sharir main 60 trillian koshikaaye hoti hai or kocaue-10 hamaari sari koshikaon main paaya jaataa he
 Since it is not soluble in blood, it uses lipoproteins as a vehicle for movement in the blood stream
 isaki maatra un angon main bahut zyada hoti he jahaan urja kii khapat zyada hoti he or chayapachay sambandhit kriyaayein zyada hoti hai jaise hriday, mastishk, gurda, yakrut or peshiyaan aadi

 The basic function of coq-10 is to produce energy in cells
 yah koshikaon main mitocondria kii aantarik jhilli kaa pramukh ghatak he
 Mitochondria are considered to be the power-houses of the cell, and it is this life energy ATP for various cellular metabolic functions and production of many elements
 Let's make
 kocaue-10 vitamin i or si kii bhanti ek atyant shaktishaalee anteoxidnt he jo bahari or aantarik ghaatak mukt-kanon se hamaare puure sharir tathaa komal angon kii raksha karte hai

 Cholesterol-lowering statin drugs reduce the level of coq-10 in the body
 stetins cholesterol ke nirmaan path ko baadhit karti hai, taaki sharir main cholesterol kaa utpaadan kam ho
 But in the production of coq-10, the same Mevalonate work-path is also used, so the production of coq-10 is also disrupted in the body of a person taking statins
 isliye statin prajati kii davaaiyaan ke saath kocaue-10 bhi dena hi chaiye taaki sharir main kocaue-10 kii kami na ho paye
 Consumption of coq-10 reduces the need for insulin
 beta-blowers bhi sharir main ho rahe kocaue-10 ke utpaadan ko thodaa kam karte hai

 Historians say that the Nair and Avarna caste had less habit of eating rice
 saadhaaran janata bajra, raagi, oats matar aadi pakaakar khaati thi
 While Namputiri people used to eat good food
 brahman jaise unchi jati ke logon ko daavat khaane kaa khub avasar miltaa tha

 In this, the most important distinction was to eat together
 kuch khaas bhojya padaarth khaas jati ke log hi kha sakate hai
 No one had the right to sit and eat with Brahmins

 An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to devices participating in a computer network using the Internet Protocol for communication between its nodes
 ek IP adress do pramukh kaary karata he: mejabaan yaa network interfes pahchaan or sthaan parichayan
 isaki bhoomika kaa charitrachitran is prakaar he: "ek naam ingit karata he ki ham kya maangate hai
 An address indicates where he is
 ek maarg ingit karata he ki vahaan tak kaise pahunchen
" The designer of TCP / IP defined the IP address as a 32-bit number, and the system, known as Internet Protocol version 4 or ipv4, is still in use today
 baharhaal, internet ke vyapak vikaas or iske parinamswaroop uplabdh paton kii kami ke kaaran, 1995 main adress ke liye 128 bit upyog kar ke ek nayaa parichayan system, viksit kiya gaya or pichhali baar 1998 main RFC 2460 dwaara manakikrut kiya gaya
 Although IP addresses are stored as binary numbers, they are usually displayed in human-textual markers such as 208

 Because of its prevalence, the generic term IP address generally still refers to the address defined by ipv4
 ipv4, 32-bit adress kaa upyog karata he, jo adress sthaan ko 4,294,967,296 ) sambhav adwitiya adress par simit karata hai
 ipv4 reserves some addresses for special purposes such as private networks or multicast addresses
 isse ant upyogkartaaon ko niyat kiye jane vaale paton kii sankhya kam ho jaati he or jaise hi uplabdh paton kii sankhya kshay ho jaati he, ipv4 pataa samaapan nishchit ho jaataa he
 This foreseeable shortfall was the primary motivation for developing ipv6, which is in various deployment stages around the world, as the only strategy for ipv4 replacement and continued expansion of the Internet
 ipv4 adress aamtaur par dot-dashamalav sanketan main darshaae jate hai 
 Each part represents 8 bits of address and is therefore called octet
 takneekee lekhan ke kam aam maamalon main, ipv4 adress, shodash aadhari, ashtadhari, yaa binary abhivedan main prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 Each octet is changed individually in the most representation
 internet protocol ke vikaas ke praarambhik charan main, network ke prashaskon ne IP adress kaa do bhaagon main varnan kiya, network sankhya bhaag or mejabaan sankhya main bhaag
 ek adress main sarvocch kram ocotate ko network number abhinihit kiya jaataa tha or baaki ke bits rest field yaa host identiphire kehalaae jate the or network ke abhyantar mezbaan sankhyankan ke liye istemaal kiye jate the
 This method soon proved to be analogous as soon as additional networks were developed that were independent of the existing networks, which would have already been characterized by a network number
 1981 main, classphul network sanrachana ke samaveshan ke saath internet parichayan vinirdesh main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 Classful network design allowed a large number of individual network tasks
 ek IP adress ke sabase mahatvapurn ocotate ke pehle teen bit, adress kii shrenee ke rup main paribhaashit kiye gaye
 Three categories were defined for universal unicast detection
 vyutpann varg ke aadhaar par network pahchaan puure pate ke octate seemaa kshetron par aadhaarit tha
 Each category used sequentially extra octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the number of possible hosts in the higher class category
 nimna talika is faltah aprachlit pranali kaa ek simhavlokan detaa he
 The description of this design is explained in the article 'subnetwork' and 'classful Network'
 haalanki classphul network abhikalp ek safal vikasaatmak avasthaa thi lekin internet ke betahasha vistaar ke kaaran ise aage badhanaa mushkil ho gaya or jab nae ypi adress khand dene ke liye classles inter-domen rooting kaa srijan kiya gaya or rooting protocol ke liye ipivi4 adress kaa prayog karne ke liye nae niyam taiyaar kiye gaye to ise chhod diya gaya
 CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking for the allocation and routing of arbitrary-length prefixes
 aaj, classphul network sankalpana ke avshisht keval ek simit kshetra main kaam karte hai jo ki kuch network software or hardware ghatakon ke diphalt kanfigration maapdand hai or network prashaskon kii charchaa ke takneekee jorganon main prayukt hote hai
 In the initial network design, when the idea of connecting all Internet users globally from one bite to another for communication was intended, each computer or device had a unique IP address
 lekin yah paaya gaya ki hameshaa aisa kar paanaa sambhav nahin he kyonki nijee network viksit ho gaye or saarvajanik paton kaa sthaan sangrakshit karne kii jarurat padi 
 Computers that are not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only through TCP / IP, are not required to have a globally unique IP address
 nijee network ke liye ipv4 paton main se teen simaaen, har varg ke liye ek seemaa, 1918 RFC main arakshit thi
 These addresses are not routed over the Internet and hence there is no need to coordinate them with the register of IP addresses
 aaj, jab jarurat padati he, aise nijee network aamtaur par network pataa anuwaad ke madhyam se internet se conect ho jate hai

 The IP version 4 address space is rapidly approaching the closing of its officially available allocated address segments

 Its permanent solution, a redesign of the Internet protocol itself, was understood
 internet protocol kii yah agali peedi, jiskaa uddeshy internet par ipv4 kii jagah lenaa tha, antat 1995 main ise internet protocol sanskaran 6 kaa naam diya gaya
 The address size was increased from 32 to 128 bit or 16 octets, which, even with a generous working of network blocks, is considered sufficient for the foreseeable future
 ganitiya, nayaa adress sthaan, adhiktam 2, yaa lagbhag 3

 The new design is not only based on the goal of providing a sufficient amount of addresses, but to allow efficient aggregation of subnet routing prefixes to occur on the routing nodes
 parinamswaroop, anumaargan talika aakaar chota hota hai or sabase chota sambhav vyaktigat aavanton 264 host ke liye ek sabanet he, jo puure ipv4 internet ke aakaar kaa vargakar he

 ipv6 has features that, if there is a change in global connectivity or routing policy, automatically change the routing prefix of the entire network without internal redesigns or new numbering
 ipv6 paton kii badi sankhya vishisht prayojanon ke liye bade block nirdisht karne kii anumati dete he or jahaan uchit he, kushal maarg ke liye ekatrit hone kii
 a complex address protection technique with a large address space is not required, such as Classless used in inter-domain routing
 sabalmodern ke anusaar desktop or udhyam sarwar oparating system ipv6 protocol ke liye nishkapat samarthan shaamil karte hai, lekin yah abhi tak anya upkarnon jaise home netwarking raootraz, vois over internet protocol or multimedia upkaran or network paridhiy main vyapak rup se tainaat nahin hai
 Example of an ipv6 address: jaise ipv4 nijee yaa aantarik network ke liye adress arakshit karata he, ipv6 main nijee adress ke liye adress ke vibhaag alag se samucchy kiye hote hai
 In ipv6, these are referred to as unique local addresses
 RFC 4,193 is vibhaag ke liye anumaargan upsarg fc00:: / 7 alag se samucchy karata he, jo ki vibhinn uplakshith nitiyon ke saath do / 8 vibhaagon main vibhajit he adress main ek 40 bit chhadam yadrichhik sankhya shaamil hoti he jo sait vilay yaa packet ke galat maarg par chal jane se hone vaale adress muthbhed ke jokhim ko kam karti he
 Initial designs used a separate section for this purpose, dubbed site-local address
 However, the definition of what constitutes a site remained unclear and a poorly defined detection policy created doubt in routing
 adress range vinirdesh chhod diya gaya or ab nai vyavastha main istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 Addresses starting with fe80: - called link-local addresses - are assigned only in the local link area
 prayek network interfes ke liye oparating system ke IP parat dwaara aamtaur par swachaalit rup se adress utpann kiye jate hai
 This provides instant automatic network connectivity for any ipv6 host and means that if multiple hosts connect to a common hub or switch, they get an instant communication route through their link local ipv6 address
 ipv6 network prashasan kii nichali paraton main is suvidha kaa bade paimaane par or adhikansh upyogkartaaon ke liye apratyaksh rup se, istemaal kiya jaataa he 
 No private address prefix can be sent to the public internet
 sabnating kii takanic donon ipv4 or ipv6 network main kaam kar sakati hai
 The IP address is divided into two parts: the network address and the host identifier
 The subnet mask or CIDR prefix determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts
 shabd sabanet mask keval ipv4 main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Both IP versions, however, use the concept and notation of classless inter-domain routing
 is main, IP adress ke peeche ek slesh or network bhaag ke liye istemaal kii gai bits kii sankhya, jise maarg upsarg bhi kaha jaataa he, hote he

 When a computer is configured to use the same IP address each time it becomes faster, it is called static IP address
 iske vipareet, un sthitiyon main jab computer ke ypi pate swatah hi niyukt kiye jate hai, use dinemic ypi adress ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Static IP address is assigned to the computer manually by an administrator
 isaki sateek prakriya platform ke anusaar pruthak hoti he
 These are not compatible with dynamic IP addresses, which are specified by either computer interfaces or self-hosted software, such as in Xerconf, or specified by a server using dynamic host configuration protocols
 haalanki DHCP ke upyog se nirdisht ypi adress lambey samay ke liye ek jaise rahete hai, vah aam taur par badal sakate hai
 In some cases, a network administrator may actively implement a specified static IP address
 is maamle main, ek DHCP sarwar kaa upyog hota he, lekin ek vishisht computer ko hameshaa ek hi ypi adress nirdisht karne ke liye, iskaa samanurup vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he
 This allows the static IP address to be primarily configured, not requiring each computer on the network to be specifically configured by a manual system
 static yaa statephul adress vinyas ke abhaav yaa vifaltaa main, ek parichaalan pranali ek network interphes ko state-les swachaalit-samakriti takanic, jaise xerokonf, ke upyog se ypi adress nirdisht kar sakati he
 Dynamic IP addresses are most frequently employed by dynamic host configuration protocol servers on lans and broadband networks
 inhen isliye istemaal kiya jaataa he kyunki yah ek network par prayek upkaran ke liye vishisht static adress nirdisht karne ke prashasnic boj se bachaa sakate he
 It also allows multiple devices to interact in a limited address space on a network, but only if some of them are online at a particular time
 In many current desktop operating systems, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default so that a user does not need to manually enter any settings to connect to a network with a DHCP server
 DHCP is not the only technique for specifying dynamic IP addresses
 dyaap or kuch broadband network bindu se bindu protocol kii gatisheel adress visheshtaayen upyog karte hai
 a sticky dynamic IP address or sticky IP cable and DSL is used by the Internet payer to describe a dynamically assigned IP address that often does not change

 Since modems typically operate for extended periods of time, address leases are often regularized for longer periods and renewed upon expiration
 yadi ek modem band kar diya jaae or adress patte ke agle samaapan se pehle phir se sanchalit kiya jaae, to is baat kii sarvaadhik sambhaavna he ki use vahi IP adress praapt hoga
 The RFC 3330 defines an address block, 169

0
0 / 16, to be used exclusively in local-link addressing for ipv4 networks
 ipv6 main, sthitik yaa gatik adress kaaryon kaa upyog karne vaala, prayek interphes fe80:: / 10 sabanet main swatah ek sthaneey-link adress praapt karata he
 These addresses are valid only on the link, such as a local network segment or a point-wise connection to which a host is connected
 ye adress margskshmiya nahin hote or nijee adreson kii tarah internet packet pratibandhan ke strot yaa gantavy nahin ho sakate hai
 When the local-link ipv4 address block was reserved, no standard existed for the address auto-configuration mechanism

 APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines due to Microsoft's marketability and, thus becoming a de facto standard in the industry
 kai varshon baad, IETF ne is kaaryashiltaa ke liye ek aupchaarik maanak, RFC 3927, sthaneey-link adress ipv4 ke sakriy vinyas kaa adhikari paribhaashit kiya
 Some infrastructure must use a static address, such as obtaining a host of the domain name system that converts the domain name to an IP address
 kisi interprize main sarwar sthapit karne ke liye sthitik adress suvidhajanak bhi he, parantu bilkul aavashyak nahin
 An address received from a DNS server comes with its own lifetime, or caching time, after which it should be viewed to confirm that it did not change
 yahan tak ki sthitik IP adress bhi network prabandhan ke parinamswaroop badal jaataa he
 According to today, firewalls are common on the Internet
 badi hui network suraksha ke liye, vah graahak ke saarvajanik ypi par aadhaarit nijee network ko abhigam niyantran karte hai
 Using a blacklist or white list, the IP address that is blocked is the client's stated public IP address, meaning if the client is using a proxy server or NAT, blocking an IP address can cause many different people Can be blocked
 IP adress prayog karne ke liye ekaadhik graahak upkaran pradarshit ho sakate hai: yaa to isliye kyonki vah ek saajhe hosting web sarwar vaataavaran kaa hissaa hai yaa kyonki ek ipv4 network adress anuvadak yaa proxi sarwar apane graahakon kii ore se ek madhyasth ke rup main kaam karata he, is avasthaa main, asli utpann IP adress ek anurodh praapt kar rahe sarwar se chhipe ho sakate he
 a common practice is for NAT to hide a large number of IP addresses in a private network
 NAT ke keval "bahari" interphes ko internet ruteble adress kii aavashkata he
 The most common net devices map TCP or UDP port numbers on the outside and individual private addresses on the inside
 jaise ek telephone number kaa site-vishesh vistaaran ho saktaa hai, port sankhya IP adress ke liye ek site-vishesh vistaaran hai
 In small home networks, NAT functions typically take place in a residential gateway device, typically sold as a "router"
 is paridrishy main, router se jude computer ke paas 'nijee' IP adress hoga or router ke paas internet ke saath samvaad karne ke liye ek shaskeey adress hoga
 This type of router allows multiple computers to share a public IP address
