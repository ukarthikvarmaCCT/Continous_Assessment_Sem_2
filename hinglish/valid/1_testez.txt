 After the death of William I, his son Fadric III ascended the throne of Germany on 9 March 1888 AD
 kintu keval 100 din rajya karne ke baad uski mrityu ho gai
 On his death, his son William II ascended the throne
 vah ek navayuvak tha
 It was a combination of many qualities and fortifications
 vah kushagra buddhi, mahatvakankshi aatmavishvasi tathaa asaadhaaran navayuvak tha
 He was selfish and arrogant and believed in the divine doctrine of the king
 kisi anya vyakti ke niyantran main rahanaa usko asay tha jiske kaaran kuch hi dinon ke uparaant uski apane chancelar bismark se anban ho gai
 Bismarck was forced to resign due to circumstances
 bismark ke patan ke uparaant wiliam ne samast satta ko apane haathon main liya or uske mantri aagyaakaari sevak ban gayi or vah swayan kaa shashan kaa karnadhaar bana
 William Kaiser was a very obstinate, ambitious and angry person
 vah kahata tha ki hamaara bhavishya samudr par nirbhar he
 His attempt to make Germany a maritime power had gained permanent hostility to England
 uski niti thi- 'sampurna vishwa par apana prabhutv sthapit karnaa
 'if he did not succeed in this, then he was ready for the destruction of the world
 vyapaarik desh hone ke kaaran england yuddh ke paksh main nahin tha, jise wiliam kaisar england kii kaayarta samajhataa tha
 He wanted to expand his empire by intimidating England in an aggressive attitude and it was a misconception that England would want to avoid war at any cost
 is prakaar wiliam kaisar ke ugr, samrajyavaadee, nirankush tathaa swechhachari vyaktitv ne europe ko mahayuddh ke kagaar par pahunchaa diya
 Caesar William II had the following three main objectives of world policy - uparokt uddeshyon kii purti karne ke abhipraay se kaisar wiliam dwitiya ne germany kii ‘videsh niti’ kaa sanchaalan karnaa aarambh kiya
 Due to the first objective, a close alliance with Austria was necessary, as he also wanted to move in the same direction and control the port of Salonika
 iskaa arth tha, madhya europe ke kootneetijna gut ko sudrudh bananaa
 Due to the conflict between the interests of Austria and Russia, it also meant the separation from Russia and finally making it their adversary
 duusare uddeshy kii purti kaa arth tha, 'sansar main jahaan kahin bhi aavashyak ho, visheshkar africa main, germany kii shakti kaa pradarshan karnaa
 'in this regard, Morocco challenged France twice in 1905 AD and 1911 AD
 tisare uddeshy kii purti kaa spasht parinaam tha england ke saath teevr pratisparddha or vaimnasy
 In summary, the natural consequence of this new policy was the hostility of Russia, France and England, and eventually the three of them converging in combat, that is, the destruction of all of Bismarck's work
 wiliam dwitiya ne apni niti se uski samast vyavastha ko nasht kar diya
 Within three years, Russia seceded from Germany and later ended her isolation by negotiating a treaty with France
 6 varsh ke andar england shatru ban gaya
 The hostility from France intensified with the intervention of Morocco, and by 1907, the Triassic Friendship of France, Russia and England was established in comparison with the threesome of Germany, Austria and Italy
 italy kaa trigut se sambandh bhi shithil padataa ja rahaa tha kintu wiliam dwitiya ne is disha main koi prayaas nahin kiya
 The Rehabilitation Treaty was to be repeated in 1890 AD by Bismarck in Germany and Russia, while William wanted to establish stronger ties with Austria than Russia so that he could succeed in bringing the eastern Mediterranean into his sphere of influence through the Balkans
 
 rus ne bhi is punaraashwaasan sandhi kii punrariti ko yah kahkar manaa kar diya ki 'sandhi badi pechida he or isamen austria ke liye dhamkee maujuud he jiske bade anishtakaari parinaam ho sakate hai
 ' punaraashwaasan sandhi kii punrariti ke na hone kaa spasht parinaam yah hua ki rus akelaa rah gaya
 It became mandatory for him to search for a friend to overcome his isolation
 abusake saamne uske shatru england or france hi the
 But being forced by his situation, he was attracted to befriend France and tried to befriend him
 ant main, 1895 i
 main donon deshon main sandhi hui jo dwigut sandhi ke naam se prasiddh he
 France was greatly benefited by this treaty and her loneliness ended
 wiliam bada mahatvakankshi tha
 He wanted to make Germany not only the fortune-maker of Europe, but the fortune-maker of the world
 bismark vishwa ke jhagadon se germany ko alag rakhana chahta tha,kintu wiliam ne europe ke baahar ke jhagadon main hastkshep karnaa aarambh kar diya
 He was not satisfied with German influence only in the Balkan Peninsula, but he wanted to see him as a world power
 isi uddeshy ke liye 1890 i
 ke uparaant germany kii vaideshik niti main vishwa-vyapee niti kaa samavesh hua
 Many of William's speeches reflect his views
 usne in pradeshon ko apane adhikaar main kiya - William wanted to bring Turkey under his sphere of influence and was a major part of his world policy
 england bhi is ore prayatnsheel tha
 He did not want to allow the dominance of any European nation to be established in Turkey, as this could have caused fear to his Indian empire
 1878 i
 kii berlin-congress tak turki par england kaa prabhutv rahaa or jab kabhi bhi kisi europea rastra ne us ore pragati karne kaa vichaar kiya to england ne uskaa datakar virodh kiya, parantu cyprus ke samjhaute ke uparaant uskaa prabhaav turki par se kam hone laga
 When England took control of Egypt in 1882 AD, the goodwill that existed between England and Turkey started to end
 ab wiliam dwitiya ne is paristhiti kaa laabh uthaakar turki ko apane prabhaav-kshetra main laane kaa praytn kiya
 In this regard, he took the following measures: kustuntuniya tak rail banane kaa bhi tha
 The opening of this route would have exposed Germany to the Persian Gulf, which would have become a matter of special concern for the Indian Empire of England
 wiliam turki ko apni ore aakarshith karne main avashya safal hua, kintu usne apni is niti se rus, france or england ko apana shatru bana liya jabaki turki kii shakti in teenon bade rashtron ke saamne naganya thi
 This policy of William cannot be called a successful policy
 usne teenon raashton ko ek saath aprasann kiya jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki tridaleey gut kaa nirmaan sambhav ho gaya
 By 1890, Germany and England had a good relationship, but when Germany started adopting a worldwide policy during the reign of William II, relations between Germany and England began to get tighter
 bismark ke pad tyaag karne ke uparaant wiliam ne germany kii nausena main vistaar karnaa aarambh kiya to england germany kii badhati hui shakti se sashankit hone laga tha
 For some time, the friendship of both of them increased, but after 1896 AD, the relationship between the two started getting bitter
 jab wiliam ne transwaal ke rastrapati cruger ko james ke akraman par vijay praapt karne ke upalaksh main badhai kaa taar bheja
 This wire created a great disarray among the people of England
 maharani victoria ne bhi apane pautra wiliam dwitiya ke is kaary kii badi ninda kii
 At this time England did not think it right to spoil relations with Germany, because he would have been left alone
 isi uddeshy kii purti ke liye usne germany se achche sambandh sthapit karne kaa praytn kiya
 Agreements between the two countries were also made with respect to Africa in 1898 AD and regarding armies in 1899 AD
 usee varsh england ke upnivesh mantri joseph chemberlen ne england, germany or sanyukt rajya ke ek trigut ke nirmaan kaa prastaav kiya, kintu 1899 i
 main bulo ne jo is samay germany kaa pradhanmantri tha, is prastaav ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 The reason for his rejection of this proposal was that it meant England to take the side of Germany in the ensuing wars and take part in the war as its supporter, and England settled from the European continent in Asia and Africa
 The empire continued to expand
 bulo kaa yah vichaar tha ki germany kii aupniveshik, vyapaarik tathaa navik unnati se england ko asuvidha hona anivaary thi or kabhi bhi donon main yuddh chhid saktaa he
 Therefore, it was well understood by the policies of Germany that over-trusting Germany would prove fatal for England and indeed a day would come when England and Germany would go to war
 france or rus ke madhya mitrataa kii sthapana ho chuki thi, ab france dwaara rus or england kii mitrataa kaa kaary aarambh hua
 In 1907, with the efforts of France, the faction of Russia and England became ready
 yah gut rakshaatmak tha kintu german samraat wiliam dwitiya ko iske nirmaan se badi chintaa hui
 Now he particularly attracted his attention towards the end of this group
 isi samay germany ko purvi samasya main hastkshep karne tathaa rus ko apamaanit karne kaa avasar praapt hua
 1908 AD There was a movement in Turkey which is known as the Young Turk Movement
 sheeghra hi austria ne bosnia tathaa harjegovina adhikaar kar liya
 Serbia could not bear it and started preparing for war
 usko yah aashaa thi ki austria tathaa germany ke viruddh rus or england uski sahaayta karne kii udyat ho jaayenge kintu rus kii abhi aisi sthiti nahin thi
 Austria dealt with Serbia very harshly, which made the war seem inevitable, but when Germany made a clear declaration that if Russia would help Serbia in any way, it would be able to fully support Austria in the war
 is ready
 is prakaar yuddh tal gaya
 At this time, Russia did not have the power to successfully counter the combined services of Germany and Austria
 rus ko baadhya hokar dab janaa padaa or german raajnneeti balkan prayadweep main safal hui
 Although the german-emperor William Kaiser succeeded in demoralizing Russia in the Balkan region and was able to expand the power and influence of his friend Austria, he remained fearful of the factions of France, Russia and England
 usne france or rus se mitrataa karne kii ore haath badhanaa aarambh kiya
 On 8 February 1909, he entered into an agreement with France, according to which France accepted the principle of independence and integrity of Morocco
 germany ne morocco kii aantarik suraksha ke sambandh main france kii asaadhaaran sthiti maan lee
 Convinced here, Germany drew its attention to compromise with Russia
 germany ne rus se navambar 1910 main mesopotamia or faras main apane hiton ke sambandh main samjhauta kiya, jiske dwaara 'rus ne germany ko berlin-baghdad railway kii yojana kaa virodh na karne kaa vachan diya or wiliam ne faras main rus ke hiton kii sweekruti pradaan kii
 ' uparokt kaaryo dwaara wiliam dwitiya rus, france or england ke gut ko nirbal karne main safal hua, kintu yah sthiti adhik kaal tak sthaayee nahin rah saki
 France and Germany attempted to address the Moroccan question, but both were not satisfied with the status of the agreement
 ‘morocco kii swatantraaa’ tathaa france kii police satta main swaabhaavik virodh tha jiske kaaran bhavishya main jhagada hona nishchit tha
 France was bent on bringing Morocco completely under its control and Germany was determined to stop it or to receive a suitable reward in return
 1911 i 
 main morocco main ek aisi ghatana ghati jisane europe ke pramukh rashtron kaa dhyaan us ore aakarshith kiya
 The fire of civil war ignited in Morocco and the Sultan of Morocco failed to suppress the rebellion
 is paristhiti ke utpann hone par france ne aantarik suraksha ke liye apane uttardaayitv kaa bahaanaa lekar ek sena bheji, jisane 21 may 1910 i
 ko morocco main vidroh kaa daman karnaa aarambh kar diya
 Germany could not tolerate such interference from France, and Germany's foreign minister declared that 'if France found it necessary to stay in Morocco, then the full problem of Morocco would be reconsidered and all the powers that signed the Algysiraj Act The freedom to work as per his wish will be regained
 ' vidraahiyon ke daman ke uparaant france kii senaayen vaapis lautne lagi, kintu is par bhi germany ne apane kade vyavhaar main kisi prakaar parivartan karnaa uchit nahin samajha
 In July 1910 AD, Germany announced that it had sent a warship to the port called Ezir in southern Morocco for the purpose of protecting German interests and German residents
 germany ke is vyavhaar ne badi sankatmay paristhiti utpann kar di or yah sambhaavna spasht drushtigochar hone lagi ki sheeghra hi europe ke raashton ke madhya yuddh kaa hona anivaary he
 Finally, a treaty was signed between France and the Germans, which was concluded on 4 November 1911, according to which it was decided that France's patronage over Morocco would continue and Germany received half the territory of the French Congo
 morocco ke prashn par germany ko munh kii khaani padi, kyonki rus, france or england kaa trirashtiy gut pehle kii apeksha ab adhik drudh tathaa sthai ho gaya tha tathaa germany or england ke sambandh din-pratidin kharaab hone aarambh ho gaye

 Keeping in mind the misbehavior of writing material in the society then, Panini has taken the help of sutra style to make the grammar memorable
 punah, vivechan ko atishay sankshipt banane hetu panini ne apane purvavarti vaiyakarnon se praapt upkarnon ke saath-saath swayan bhi anek upkarnon kaa prayog kiya he jiname shivasutra yaa maheshwar sutara sabase mahatvapurn hai
 The origin of the Maheshwar Sutras is attributed to the Tandava dance performed by Lord Nataraja
 arthath:-"nrity ke avsaan par nataraj ne sanakaadi rishiyon kii siddhi or kaamana kaa uddhaar ke liye navpanch baar damru bajaayaa
 In this way, this web of fourteen Shivasutras appeared
 " Playing the fourteen times of Damru produced sounds in the form of fourteen sutras, the grammar was revealed by these sounds

 Pratyahara means short statement
 ashtaadhi ke pratham adhyay ke pratham paad ke 71wein sutara ‘adirantyen saheta’ sutara dwaara pratyaahaar banane kii vidhi kaa panini ne nirdesh kiya he
 Adirantyen Saheta: The Adi Varna creates a pratyahar with the last Varna Varna, which gives a comprehensive understanding of the Adi Varna and the pre-conscious Varna Varna
 udhaaharan: ach = pratham maheshwar sutara ‘aiun’ ke aadi varna ‘a’ ko chaturth sutara ‘aiuch’ ke antim varna ‘ch’ se yoga karaane par ach pratyaahaar banataa he
 This good pratyahar makes sense of all the letters from its initial letter 'A' to the one who comes before it

 As a result, uparyukt sabhi 14 sutron main antim varna ko panini ne it kii sangya di he
 Since it is a noun, these last characters are used only for contract to make pratyahar, but they are not counted in the grammatical process i

 'thakur' naam ke hindi main teen prasiddh kavi hue hai - asanivaale pracheen thakur, asanivaale duusare thakur or tisare thakur bundelkhandi
 Being three in number, they are also called 'thakurtrayi'
 inamen pehle do thakur asani ke rahane vaale brahmabhatt the
 The time of ancient Thakur is believed to be around 1700
 inaki svachh or chalati bhashaa main likhi footkal kavitaayen hi 'kalidas hajaaraa' aadi kavyasangrahon main yatra-tatra bikhri pai jaati hai
 By the way, the compositions of the three Thakurs have got so mixed that it is quite difficult to differentiate them easily

 Thakur was born in 1792, according to Ramnaresh Tripathi
 kaashi ke nami rais or kashiraj ke sambandhi babu devakinandan thakur kavi ke ashrayadata the jinke prityrth kavi ne 'bihari satsai' ko 'devakinandan tikaa', 'satsai bernarth' banaai
 His poetry has expressions and linguistic elegance, wonders and plausibility
 sukumaar bhavvyanjana, vimuguakari uktichamatkaar or nirbaadh drishyanirvaah, duusare thakur kii kavita ke pramukh gun hai
 The third Bundelkhandi Thakur was a distinguished and loving poet of the ritualistic ritual, who is believed to have been born in Orchhe around 1823 and Dehavasan 1880

 This was Srivastava Kayastha

 Thakur entered almost all the courts of Bundelkhand

 baandaa ke himmatbahadur gosai ke yahan bhi, jo padmakar ke pramukh ashrayadaataaon main the, thakur kaa baraabar aana janaa tha
 Since Thakur was a contemporary of Padmakar, the two would meet when they were there, which resulted in the occasional poetic competition-driven thumping and banging which many popular folk legends of this kind address
 prakruti se thakur svachhand, manamaujee, nirbhik, spashtvaadi, swabhimani, saundaryapremi, bhavuk, 'virodhiyon ke prati ugr evam sahyogiyon ke prati sahruday', udaar or buddhi ke doordarshee, kushal, marm tak pahunchnewale tathaa deshkal kii gati ko acchhee tarah pahchaananevaale vyakti the

 Due to the convincing of surreal, true and exuberant emotion in poetry, Thakur was as much irritated by the ritualistic tradition of poetic creation as the Tulsidas from the Gorakhists and Kabirists
 'logan kavitt kiwo khel kari jaano he' se ant honevaala kavitt ukt kathan kaa pratyaksh pramaan or kavi kii khiz, fatkaar tathaa us kaal kii rityashrayi hrasonmukhi kavita par karaare vyangy kaa suchak he
 For a long time, Thakur's compositions continued to appear in many ancient poetry collections in the form of sputum, but much later two collections named 'thakur Shatak' and 'thakur Thasak' were prepared
 'thakur shatak' ke, jisamen teenon thakuron kii kavitaayen, sangrahakarta the dumraanv nivasee nakchhedi tiwari 'ajaan' kavi or jiskaa prakaashan kaashi ke 'bharat jivan press' se uske adhyaksh babu ramakrishna verma 'vir' ke nirdesan main san 1904 i0 main hua tha
 After that, in 1926, Lala Bhagwadin brought out a collection of 'thakur Thasak' from the Sahitya Sevak office of Kashi in 1926, which had only the footsteps of the third Thakur, but even after making a lot of efforts, he could not fully and clearly differentiate among the Thakurs' works
 
 lala ji ne 'thakur thasak' main 104 chand to 'thakur shatak' se hi liye, shesh 88 chand nae dhunde
 Thakur was a poet of natural and natural feeling
 unki kavitaaon main sarvatra yah saral or nishchal bhavanubhuti tarangit milti he
 He was an advocate of freedom in the field even while fully accepting the urge for art
 kavi ke paas jivan ke saras or anuthe bhaavon ke saath anuthi bhashaa bhi thi
 Though the subject of the poetry of Thakur is also akin to the ritualistic poets, adornment, devotion and policy, the type of experiment is quite different from that
 'prem ke panth' ko apanaakar bhi kavi nayikabhed ke chakkar main nahin padaa
 He has used the moving language of normal behavior
 akrutrim bhashastyli, sukumaar bhavabhivyakti ke liye paryaapt sakasham he
 No other person has used the phrase, idiom and popular words like the rational and accurate use of this poet
 isse abhivyakti swaabhaavik, manohar, sajiv or vyanjanapurna ho uthi he
 There was a smooth movement of the poet in Savaiya verses which had a clear impact on Bharatendu
 inhen visheshtaon ke kaaran anek samikshakon ne kavi ke kavy kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa karte hue likhaa he - 'premavishyak aise sachche or taksaali chand praaia: kisi bhi kavi kii rachana main nahin paae jate
 This great poet has depicted the human nature and the heartfelt expressions and waves of Chitsagar very successfully '

 Annual rainfall - mm jiladhikari - Rama is recognized as an incarnation of God in ancient India
 hindu dharm main ram vishnu ke das avtaron main se saatven avatar hai
 The life and might of Rama is described as the Sanskrit epic Ramayana composed by Maharishi Valmiki
 goswami tulsidas ne bhi unke jivan par kendrit bhakthibhaavpurn suprasiddh mahakavy shri ramcharitamanas kii rachana kii he
 Apart from these two, Ramayana has also been composed in other Indian languages, which are also very famous
 khaas taur par uttar bharat main ram atyant poojyaneey hai or adarsh purush hai
 They are also embellished with the term Purushottam
 ram, ayodhya ke raja dasharath or rani kaushalya ke sabase bade putr the
 Ram's wife was named Sita and had three brothers - Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna
 hanuman, bhagwaan ram ke, sabase bade bhakt maane jate hai
 Rama killed Ravana, the king of Lanka
 ram kii pratishtha maryaada purushottam ke rup main he
 Rama left the kingdom, friends, parents, even wife to follow decorum

 Ram was born in Raghukul, whose tradition was that of Pran Jahun Baru Bachnu Na Jai
 shriram ke pita dasharath ne unki sauteli mata kaikeyi ko unki kinhin do ichchhaaon ko puraa karne kaa vachan diya tha
 Kaikeyi came under the guise of maid Manthara as these vars asked King Dasaratha for his son Bharata for the throne of Ayodhya and fourteen years of exile for Rama
 pita ke vachan kii raksha ke liye ram ne khushi se chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas sweekaar kiya
 Wife Sita thought it appropriate to go to the forest with her husband, giving the example of the ideal wife
 bhai lakshmana ne bhi ram ke saath chaudaa varsh van main bitaye
 Bharata rejects Mata's order for justice and goes to the elder brother Rama in the forest and brings him to his feet
 phir ise hi raaj gaddi par rakh kar rajkaaj kiya
 When Ram was a forest dweller, his wife Sita took Ravana away
 jangal main ram ko hanuman jaisaa mitra or bhakt mila jisane ram ke saare kaary puure karaaye
 Rama finds Sita with the help of monkeys

 After killing him, bring Sita back

 Ram was justice-loving
 unhone bahut acha shashan kiya isliye log aaj bhi achche shashan ko raamarajy kii upama dete hai
 His two sons Kush and Love handled their kingdoms
 hindu dharm ke kai tyohaar, jaise dashahra, ram navami or deepawali, ram kii jivan-katha se jude hue hai
 The word 'ram' is derived from the addition of the suffix 'ghan' in 'rum' metal
 'ram' dhaatu kaa arth raman karne se sambaddh he
 They 'raman' in the heart of a creature, therefore 'ram' and devotees 'raman' in them, therefore they are also 'ram'
 'vishnusahasranam' par likhit apane bhashya main aadya shankaracharya ne padmapurana kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki nityanandswarup bhagavan main yogijan raman karte hai, isliye ve 'ram' hai
 Rama is not mentioned in Vedic literature in the prevailing form
 rugveda main keval do sthalon par hi 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 One of them has been used in the meaning of black in one place and the remaining one in the meaning of person; But there is also no indication of his being an avatar man or Dasaratha-son
 yadhyapi nilkanth chaturdhar ne rugveda ke anek mantron ko swavivek se chunakar unke ramakthaparak arth kiye hai, parantu yah unki nijee manyata he
 The Ramakathaparaka meaning of those mantras has not been proved by any indication or any other commentary received in those cases of Rigveda itself
 rugveda main ek sthal par 'ikshvakuh' kaa tathaa ek sthal par 'dasharath' shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But there is no indication of his association with Rama
 brahman sahitya main 'ram' shabd kaa prayog aitarey brahman main do sthalon par hua he; parantu vahaan unhen 'raamo margveyah' kaha gaya he, jiskaa arth acharya sayan ke anusaar 'mrigavu' naamak stri kaa putr he
 The word 'ram' is used at a place in the Shatapatha Brahmin
 yahan 'ram' yajna ke acharya ke rup main he tathaa unhen 'ram auptpasvini' kaha gaya he
 This means that the incarnation of the prevalent Rama is due to the Valmiki Ramayana and the Puranas

 Here only the position of Jupiter and Moon are clear
 brihaspati ucchsth he tathaa chandramaa swagruhi
 Further in the fifteenth verse, the Sun is mentioned to be high
 is prakaar brihaspati tathaa surya ke ucch hone kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Mercury is always near the Sun
 atah surya ke ucch hone par buddha kaa ucch hona asambhav he
 In this way, the remaining three planets - Mars, Venus and Saturn are left to grow higher
 isi kaaran se praayah sabhi vidwaanon ne ram-janm ke samay main surya, mangal, brihaspati, shukr tathaa shani ko ucch main sthit mana he
 Traditionally, Rama's birth is believed to be in Treta Yuga
 hindu dharamshastron main, visheshtah puranic sahitya main uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar ek chaturyugi main 43,20,000 varsh hote hai, jinamein kaliyug ke 4,32,000 varsh tathaa dwapar ke 8,64,000 varsh hote hai
 Rama was born in Treta Yug i
e
 before Dwapara
 chunki kaliyug kaa abhi prarambh hi hua he or ram kaa janm treta ke ant main hua tathaa avatar lekar dharti par unke vartmaan rahane kaa samay paramparaagat rup se 11,000 varsh mana gaya he
 Hence 8,64,000 years of Dwapara Yuga + 11,000 years of Rama's existence + 5,100 years since the end of Dwapara Yuga = 8,80,100 years in total
 atev paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm aaj se lagbhag 8,80,100 varsh pehle mana jaataa he
 Eminent Marathi researcher scholar Dr
 Padmakar Vishnu Vartak has considered this time probable from a point of view
 unka kahana he ki valmikiy ramayana main ek sthal par vindhyachal tathaa himalay kii oonchaai ko samaan bataaya gaya he
 The height of Vindhyachal is 5,000 feet and it is almost constant, while the height of the Himalayas is currently 29,029 feet and it is continuously growing
 donon kii oonchaai kaa antar 24,029 feet he
 According to experts, the Himalayas grow 3 feet in 100 years
 atah 24,029 feet badhane main himalay ko kareeb 8,01,000 varsh lage honge
 Hence, the height of the Himalayas must have been similar to that of Vindhyachal, about 8,01,000 years ago, which is mentioned in the present-day form in Valmiki Ramayana
 is tarah da0 vartak ko ek drushti se yah samay sambhav lagata he, parantu unka swayan maananaa he ki ve kisi anya strot se is samay kii pushti nahin kar sakate hai
 In his well-known treatise 'vaastav Ramayana', Dr
 Vartak has done the math on the basis of the planets, according to the planetary position mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana, to determine the actual birth date of Rama on 4 December 7323 BC
 unke anusaar isi tithi ko din main 1:30 se 3:00 baje ke bich ram kaa janm hua hoga
 After several years of research by Dr
 p
v
vartak, a research team of 'i-serve' proved Shri Ram's birth on 10 January 5114 BC using 'planetarium Gold' software
 unka maananaa tha ki is tithi ko grahon kii vahi sthiti thi jiskaa varnan valmikiy ramayana main he
 But this time has become very suspicious
 'ai-sarv' ke shodh dal ne jis 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog kiya vah vastav main isa purv 3000 se pehle kaa sahi grah-ganit karne main sakasham nahin he
 In fact, before 2013, there was no available software capable of doing so much earlier planetary mathematics
 is gananaa dwaara praapt grah-sthiti main shani vrishchik main tha arthath ucch main nahin tha
 The moon was not in Punarvasu Nakshatra but was in the second phase of Pushya and the date was also Ashtami
 baad main anya visheshgy dwaara ejplde431 software dwaara kii gayi sahi gananaa main tithi to navami ho jaati he parantu shani vrishchik main hi aata he tathaa chandramaa pushya ke chaturth charan main
 Therefore, the date of 10 January 5114 BCE is virtually not proved to be the birth date of Shri Ram
 aisi sthiti main ab yadi dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak dwaara pehle hi parishodhit tithi software dwaara pramanit ho jaae tabhi shriram kaa vaastavik samay praayah sarvamaanya ho paaegaa athwa pramanit na ho paane kii sthiti main naveen tithi ke shodh kaa rasta khulegaa
 There is clear evidence about the birth of Shri Ram in the Puranas that Shri Ram was born in a city called Ayodhya in Faizabad district of present-day Uttar Pradesh
 ayodhya jo ki bhagwaan ram ke purvajon kii hi rajdhani thi
 Raghu was the ancestor of Ramchandra ji
 ram bachapan se hi shant swabhaav ke vir purush the
 He always gave dignity the highest position
 isi kaaran unhen maryaada purushottam ram ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 His kingdom was considered fair and prosperous
 isliye bharat main jab bhi suraaj kii baat hoti he to ramraj yaa raamarajy kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 Rama, who followed the path of religion, received education from Guru Vasistha along with his three brothers
 kishoravastha main guru vishwamitra unhen van main rakshason dwaara machaae ja rahe utpaat ko samaapt karne ke liye saath le gayi
 Rama was accompanied by his younger brother Lakshmana in this task
 tadka naamak rakshasi baxur main rahati thi
 He was killed there
 ram ne us samay tadka naamak rakshasi ko maaraa tathaa marich ko palaayan ke liye majaboor kiya
 During this time, Guru Vishwamitra took him to Mithila
 vahaan ke videh raja janak ne apni putree sita ke vivaah ke liye ek swayamvar samaaroh yojit kiya tha
 Where Lord Shiva had a bow whose Sita was to be married to the knight who donated the emblem
 bahut saare raja maharaja us samaaroh main padhaare the
 When many kings tried to put a bow on the bow even after trying, they could not even lift it, then Rama tried to offer the bow by raising Vishwamitra's command
 unki pratyancha chadhaane ke praytn main vah mahaan dhanush ghor dhwani karte hue tut gaya
 When Maharishi Parashurama heard this loud sound, he came there and started expressing anger at his Guru's bow breaking
 lakshmana ugr swabhaav ke the
 He had a dispute with Parashurama
 tab ram ne bich-bachaav kiya
 Thus Sita was married to Rama and was blessed by all people including Parashurama
 ayodhya main ram sita sukhpurvak rahane lage
 People wanted Rama very much
 unki mridul, janasevayukta bhaavana or nyaaypriyata ke kaaran unki vishesh lokapriyata thi
 King Dasharatha was heading towards Vanaprastha
 at: unhone rajyabhaar ram ko saunpne kaa sochaa
 There was also a pleasant wave in public that their beloved king is about to appoint their beloved prince as king
 us samay ram ke anya do bhai bharat or shatrughna apane nanihaal kaikey gaye hue the
 Kaikeyi's maid Manthara misleads Kaikeyi that the king is doing wrong with you
 tum raja kii priy rani ho to tumhaari santan ko raja bananaa chahie par raja dasharath ram ko raja bananaa chaahate hai
 a detailed account of Rama's childhood is found in the Balakanda of Swami Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas
 raja dasharath ke teen raniyaan thim: kaushalya, sumitra or kaikeyi
 Ram was the son of Kaushalya, Sumitra had two sons, Lakshmana and Shatrughna and Kaikeyi's son Bharata
 rajya niyamo se raja kaa jyeshtha ladkaa hi raja banane kaa paatr hota he at: ram ko ayodhya kaa raja bananaa nishchit tha
 Kaikeyi who twice saved Dasharatha's life and Dasaratha gave her the boon that she could ask for two brides at any moment of her life
 ram ko raja banate hue or bhavishya ko dekhte hue kaikeyi chaahati thi uskaa putr bharat hi raja bane, isliye unhone raja dasharath dwaara ram ko 14 varsh kaa vanvaas dilaayaa or apane putr bharat ke liye ayodhya kaa rajya maang liya
 In the verses, the king Dasaratha was forced to accept this
 ram ne apane pita kii ajna kaa paalan kiya
 Ram's wife Sita and her brother Lakshmana also went to exile
 vanvaas ke samay, ravan ne sita kaa haran kiya tha
 Ravana was a demon and the king of Lanka
 ramayana ke anusaar, jab ram, sita or lakshmana kutiyaa main the tab ek hiran kii vaani sunakar sita vyakul ho gayi
 That deer was Ravana's maternal uncle Marich
 usne ravan ke kehane par sunahare hiran kaa rup banaaya
 Sita was fascinated to see him and requested Shriram to hunt the deer
 shriram apni bharya kii ichha puri karne chal pade or lakshmana se sita kii raksha karne ko kaha| marich shriram ko bahut dur le gaya
 On getting the opportunity, Shriram shot an arrow and killed the deer Marich
 marate-marate marich ne jor se "he sita! he lakshmana!" kii awaz lagaayi| us awaz ko sun sita chintit ho gayin or unhone lakshmana ko shriram ke paas jane ko kaha| lakshmana janaa nahin chaahate the, par apni bhabhi kii baat ko inkaar na kar sake
 Laxman drew a line before leaving, which is popularly known as Laxman Rekha
 ram, apane bhai lakshmana ke saath sita kii khoj main dar-dar bhatak rahe the
 Then they met two apes named Hanuman and Sugriva
 hanuman, ram ke sabase bade bhakt bane
 In order to reclaim Sita, Bhagavan Rama defeated Hanuman, Vibhishana and the monkey army with the help of Hanuman, Vibhishana and Vanara Sena, and on returning, guided Vibhishan to the good ruler by making him the king of Lanka
 bhagwaan ram ne jab ravan ko yuddh main parrast kiya or uske chote bhai vibhishana ko lanka kaa raja bana diya
 Ram, Sita, Lakshman and some monkeys departed from the Pushpak plane towards Ayodhya
 vahaan sabase milane ke baad ram or sita kaa ayodhya main rajbhishek hua
 The entire state started spending efficient time
 sita kii sati pramanikta siddh hone ke pashchaat sita apane donon putron kush or lav ko ram ke god main saunp kar dharti mata ke saath bhugarbha main chali gai
 Thereafter, the life of Ram's birth was also completed

 That is, on every action, the opposite reaction occurs
 isi tarah tarabine kaa propeller kaam karata he
 The spindle in the propeller exerts pressure on air or water
 isi dabaav kii vajah se propeller tarabine ko peeche kii ore dhakka martha he, jisase vah chalati he
 Usually the turbine is kept in one place, so that whenever the water passes through it, it is driven by the pressure on each blade of the turbine
 The same rule applies with wind or water turbines
 jitna adhik pani yaa hawa kaa pravaah hoga, tarabine utani tej gati se chalegi
 Those are the basic driving devices that convert the potential energy contained in water into mechanical work

 Whenever a power is thought to be produced by running an electric motor or turbine with the help of the energy received by the flow of water or domination at any place, it must first make a reasonable estimate of the energy derived from the surrounding water body or water source
 goes
 jalchaalit motaron kaa vargeekaran - yah vargeekaran nimnlikhit prakaar he : These chakras run due to the impact of the flow of water in the stream or due to the load of water in the chakras
 ye kisi nojal main se nikalanevaali pani kii atyadhik vegayukt pradhar kii gatij urja dwaara chalate hai
 This type of impulse cycle is used only where the amount of water is limited but its pressure is high
 isamen pani kii gatij urja tathaa daab donon kaa hi upyog hota he
 They are planted where the conditions are opposite to those described for the impulse cycle and the impulse turbine, ie, where water may be obtained in very small quantities even though it is of very high altitude
 is pani kaa oonchaai 5 se lekar 500 foot tak ho saktaa he
 The flow of water and the energy generated by the use of gravity-driven cycles are now considered suitable for cottage industries in the countryside, in the mountainous places where the springs constantly flow
 is prakaar ke chakron main ad:pravaahee, ponsle madhyapravahee or urdhvapravahee chakra pramukh hai, lekin badi maatra main vidyudutpaadan ke liye ye sarvatha anupyukt samajhe jate hai, phir bhi sahaayak motor ke rup main, In large power stations, the upstream wheel is used, as and when required, with modern plants
 kaaryakshmata lagbhag 25 prati shat hi hoti he, isamen pani kii bahut si urja vyarth main nasht ho jaati he
 It was used a lot till 1,800 AD
 yah ardhapravahee chakra kaa hi parishkrut rup he
 Its petals are folded in such a way that water enters them without any shock and when exiting them, it passes only in the tangential direction of the circumference of the circle, which gets more impulse and The efficiency of the cycle almost doubles
 yah bhi ad:pravaahee chakra kaa hi parishkrut rup he
 The water in its conical petals begins to fill in the petals, located at some height from the plane of the axis of the wheel, and is filled with them until they come down
 chakra kii khol bhi is pani ko unamem bharaa rakhane main kuch sahaayta karti he, at: yah chakra mukhyatya pani ke bhaar ke kaaran hi ghumta he
 There are also two types of diaphragmatic cycles
 ek to madhyocch pravaahee or doosraa ad:madhyapravahee kehalaata he
 The water in its petals begins to fill in some of the petals below the floor of the spindle, using both water loads and flow-related energies
 in chakron kii kaaryakshmata 50 prati shat se lekar 80 prati shat tak ho sakati he, jo inaki banaavat tathaa aakaar par nirbhar karti he

 Modern types of impulse cycles are sophisticated forms of Ponsley's downstream cycles
 inamen sloos maarg ke sthaan par tudon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jinamein se pani kii pradhar bade beg se nikalakar chakra kii pankhudiyon se takaraati he
 The plant that is most widely publicized in this manner is known as the Pelton cycle, in which it has a drawing and a torrent diagram
 dolchi ko do judwaan pyaalon ke rup main is prakaar bana diya gaya he ki pani kii pradhar uske madhya main takaraate hi fatkar, do bhaagon main vibhakt hokar, ek duusari se lagbhag 180 degree ke konantar par chalane lagati he
 If both of these sub-systems flow in exactly the opposite direction from their original, then the efficiency of the Pelton cycle must be 100 per cent, but they are deliberately skewed, so that they do not collide with their near pole
 aisa karne se avashya hi kuch urja gharshan main barabaad ho jaati he, jisase is chakra kii kaary-kshamta lagbhag 80 pratishat hi rah jaati he
 In this, water enters through the marked passage and falls from the spout onto the wing on the wheel
 isamen pravesh karte samay, baahar nikalate samay kii apeksha, pani kaa veg bahut adhik hota he
 Hence, their path is widened outwards
 sanyukt rajya, america main is tarabine kaa nirmaan 'victor ucchdaab tarabine' naam se kiya jaataa he, jisaki kaaryakshmata 70 pratishat se lekar 80 pratishat tak, uske abhikalp tathaa aakaar ke anusaar hoti he
 == Reaction turbine == - In the impulse cycle, only the kinetic energy of water works, but both reactive and pressurized energies in the reactive cycle work together

 a French engineer named Ferneron, in accordance with Barker Mill's theory, made the guide pools in a radial manner to flow outward from the central waterway in a radial direction, with their outward petalled circle, with a central chamber, with water entering it
 In the radius direction, the tunda marked out goes out by rotating the wings marked in the circle
 isamen gha kendriya dhura he, jisase dianemo aadi sambandhit rahata he
 This is a sample of a radius outflow turbine
 juwal kaa aksheeya pravahyukt tarabine - jiske vibhinn avyavon ke sanketakshar purvavarnit tarabine chitra jese hi hai
 The flow of water in it, as demonstrated by the symbols, remains parallel to the axis
 iskaa abhikalp je0 bi0 fransis naamak suvikhyath american ejeeniyar ne banaaya tha
 In this, the water from the fonts marked in the radial direction from the outside, enters the inner direction by moving the wings moving near the center, the bottom being around the axis, the water flows out
 tarabinon ke dhavan chakra - a rotating wheel of turbines with a circle or wings on its circumference is called a runner
 tarabinon kaa yahi pramukh avyav he jisaki uttam banaavat tathaa santulan par unki kaaryakshmata tathaa shakti nirbhar karti he
 The two types of turbines are often more useful, one is radially intermittent reactive and the other is impulsive

 If we shorten and shrink the various measurements of a running wheel so that it starts to rotate so much per minute with one foot dominated water that it gets one horsepower, then that number of rounds is called the characteristic speed of that cycle, which follows The formula is expressed by: kisi vishesh tarawine ke liye dhavan chakra kaa vyas kya hona chahie, yah nimnlikhit sutara se nishchit kiya ja saktaa he : Diameter in inches is sutara main ba = varchas phuton main; sa = dhavanchakra kii chaal, chakkar prati minute main
 The value of coefficient c is kept at 0
6 for high dominated turbines, 0
7 for medium dominated turbines and 0
8 for low dominated turbines
 jalchalit motaron ke parishkrut rup ab bhi thodi maatra main shakti utpaadan karne ke liye dehati kshetron main prayukt hote hai
 The diameter of their single circle is made up to 60 feet and its width is kept so that it can run 3,000 cubic feet of water per minute

 The design of the pelton spout, by controlling the spindle of an informant valve attached to it with square bangles back and forth from the handcuffs, is more or less opening the mouth of the spout, controlling the water holdings
 iskaa parichaalan niyantrak yantra dwaara bhi kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa varnan aage kiya jayega
 Pelton's impulse cycles are made in many measurements ranging from laboratory small equipment to 18,000 horsepower output

 rakhmabai raaoot bharat kii pratham mahila chikitsak thim
 She was also at the center of a landmark legal case that resulted in a law called the 'age of Consent Act, 1891'
 jab vah keval gyaarah varsh kii thim tabi unniis varshiya dulhe dadaji bhikaaji se unka vivaah kar diy gaya tha
 She however lived in the house of her widowed mother Jayantibai, who then married assistant surgeon Sakharam Arjun
 jab dadaji or unke parivaar ne rukhmabai ko apane ghar jane ke liye kaha, to unhone inkaar kar diya or unke sautele-pita ne uske is nirnay kaa samarthan kiya
 This led to a long series of court cases from 1884, leading to a large public discussion on child marriage and women's rights
 rukhmabai ne is dauraan apni padhai jari rakhi or ek hindu mahila ke naam par ek akhbaar ko patr likhe
 He received the support of many people in this matter and when he expressed his desire to study his doctorate, a fund was prepared for sending and studying at the London School of Madison
 usne snaatak kii oopaadhi praapt kii or bharat kii pehali mahila doctoron main se ek banakar 1895 main bharat lauti, or surat main ek mahila aspataal main kaam karne lagi
 Rukhmabai was born to Janardhana Pandurang and Jayantibai who belonged to the community of carpenters
 jab janardan pandurang kii mrityu hui, to jayantibai ne apni sampatti rukhmabai ko saunp di, jo tab keval aath barsh kii thim or jab vah gyaarah kii hui, tab uski maa ne apni beti kii shaadi dadaji bhikaaji ke saath kar di
 Then at the age of nineteen, Jayantibai married a widower, Dr
 Sakharam Arjun, but stayed in the Rukhmabai family's home and studied at home using books from the Free Church Mission Library
 rukhmabai or unki mata prathana samaaj or arya mahila samaj kii saptahik baithkon main niyamit thim
 Grandpa's mother was no more and lived with his maternal uncle Narayan Dharmaji
 dhurmaji ke ghar ke vaataavaran ne dadaji ko aalas or aawaargi kii jindagi main daal diya
 Dharmaji had a concubine in his house and his wife attempted suicide
 rukhmabai ne baarah varsh kii umr main dharmaji ke ghar par dadaji ke saath rahane ke liye manaa kar diya or sakhaaraam arjuna ne uske is nirnay kaa samarthan kiya
 In March 1884, Dadaji sent a letter through his lawyers Chalk and Walker, asking Sakharam Arjun to stop preventing Rukhmabai from joining him
 sakhaaraam arjuna ne civil patron ke madhyam se jawaab diya ki vah use nahin roak rahaa tha, lekin jald hi vah bhi kanoonee sahaayta praapt karne ke liye majaboor ho gaya tha
 Through Payne, Gilbert and Sayani lawyers, Rukhmabai provided the basis for refusing to join Grandpa
 dadaji kaa daawa he ki rukhmabai ko isliye dur rakhaa ja rahaa tha kyonki vah apane pita kii sampatti ke adhikaron par jor de sakati thi
 Dadaji Bhikaji v
 Rukhmabai, came to the hearing on 1885 with Bhikaji seeking "restitution of marital rights" and the judgment was passed by Justice Judge Robert Hill Pinhe
 pinhe ne kaha ki punarsthapana par angreji udhaaharan yahan lagu nahin hote kyonki angreji kanoon sahamat paripakv vayaskon par lagu kiya janaa tha
 There was a shortage in cases of English law and no precedent was found in Hindu law
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki rukhmabai kii shaadi uske "asahaay bachapan" main kar di gai the or vah ek yuva mahila ko majaboor nahin kar sakate the
 Pinhe retired after this last case and in 1886 the case came up for trial
 rukhmabai ke vakeelon main jedy invarrity junior or telung shaamil the
 Various sections of the society found Rowla, while others were praised
 kuch hinduon ne daawa kiya ki kanoon ne hindu simaaon kii pavitrataa kaa sammaan nahin kiya, jab vastav main pinehe ne kiya tha
 Pinhey's decision was strongly criticized by Vishwanath Narayan Mandlik from the anglo-marathi weekly Native Opinion who supported Dadaji
 lokmanay bal gangadhar tilak, maharata dwaara chalaaya ja rahe ek puna saptahik, maratha ne likhaa tha ki pinehe ko hindu kanoonon kii bhaavana samaj main nahin aayaa or vah "hinsak tareekon" dwaara sudhaar chahta he
 Meanwhile, a series of articles in the Times of India written under the name Kalmi of a Hindu Lady also had public backlash during the case and it was revealed that the writer was none other than Rukhmabai
 is maamle main gavaahon main se ek, ke
aar
 kirtikar, purv main sakhaaraam arjuna ke ek chaatr ne daawa kiya ki is maamle main pahchaan kii koi baat nahin he
 Kirtikar was in Grandpa's support though
 vivaad ke kai binduon ke bare main saarvajanik bahes chalati he - hindu banaam english kanoon, baahar banaam andar se sudhaar, pracheen rivaaz kaa sammaan kiya janaa chahie yaa nahin or isi tarah
 An appeal against the first case was made on 18 March 1886 and it was upheld by Chief Justice Sir Charles Sargeant and Justice Farran
 4 farvari 1887 ko nyaayamurti ferran ne maamle ko hindu kanoonon kii vyakhyaaon ke jariye handle kiya or duusare disha main gaye or rukhmabai ko apane pati ke saath rahane yaa chah maheene kii karawas kaa saamana karne kaa aadesh diya gaya
 Rukhmabai bravely wrote that she would pay the maximum penalty instead of following this decision
 iske kaaran aage or uthal-puthal or bahes hui
 Balgangadhar Tilak wrote in Kesari that Rukhmabai's disobedience was the result of an English education and declared that Hinduism was in danger
 maiks mular ne likhaa he ki kanoonee maarg rukhmabai ke maamle main dikhaai gai samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin tha or kaha ki yah rukhmabai kii shiksha thi jisane unhen apane vikalpon kaa sarvshereshth nyaayadhish bana diya tha
 Everywhere, it is considered one of the greatest blessings of God that we are under the protection of the government of our beloved Queen Victoria, which has a worldwide fame for its excellent administration
 agar aisi sarkaar hamen hindu mahila ko azaad karne main madad nahin kar sakati he, to dharti par kis sarkaar ke paas vartmaan dukhon se india kii betiyon ko mukt karne kii shakti he? hamaari rani ke sabase pratishthit singhaasana par baithne ke 50 wein varsh kaa jubilee varsh he, jisamen har shahar or har gaanv apane prabhutv main sabase acha tareeke se apni vafadari ko dikhaane ke liye he, or maa rani ko ek bahut hi sukhi jivan kii ichha, shanti or samruddhi ke saath or kai varshon takahamaare par shashan kare
 On such an unusual occasion the mother hears a deep appeal to her millions of Indian daughters and gives a few simple words of change in the book on Hindu law- 'boys under 20 and girls under 15 Marriages will not be considered legal from the point of view of law before the court
 ' agyaat logon ke bich ek badi dikkat paidaa kiye bina, bal vivaahon par paryaapt jaanch karne ke liye vartmaan main yah keval ek vaakya paryaapt hoga
 This jubilee year we should leave some expression on Hindu women, and the introduction of this punishment in our law books will bring much gratitude
 yah ek din kaa kaam he agar bhagwaan ne yah kaamana kii, lekin uski sahaayta ke bina har sambhav prayaas vyarth lagata he
 So far, dear lady, i have thought on your patience, for which it is necessary to apologize
 sabase acchhee prashansa ke saath - main tumhaari bahut eemaandaaree se rahoongi, rukhmabai
 After a series of court cases, which confirmed the marriage, she wrote a letter to Queen Victoria, who dismissed the court and dissolved the marriage
 july 1888 main, dadaji ke saath ek samjhauta hua or unhone rukhmabai par do hajaar rupaye ke bhugtan ke liye apana daawa chhod diya
 Tad Rukhmabai left to study in England

 At Cama Hospital, Dr
 Edith Peche encouraged Rukhmabai, who helped raise funds for her education
 rukhmabai 1889 main england gai thi taaki ve landan skool of medicine for vimen main adhyayan kar saken
 Rukhmabai was assisted by franchise activists Eva mclaren and Walter mclaren and the Countess of Dufferin's Fund to provide medical assistance to women in India

 sakriy nirdeshika ek kendriya databes main soochna or settings kaa bhandaaran karti he
 Active Directory networks can vary from a small installation with a few computers, users, and printers to thousands of millions of users spread across multiple geographic locations, many different domains, and large server farms
 sakriy nirdeshika kaa purvavlokan 1999 main kiya gaya, vindos 2000 sarwar ke sanskaran ke saath pehali baar jari kiya gaya or vindos sarwar 2003 main isaki kaaryakshmata ko badhaane or vyavasthaapan main sudhaar laane ke liye ise sanshodhit kiya gaya

 Active Directory was called NTDS Directory Service) in older Microsoft documents
 is naam ko abhi bhi sakriy nirdeshika kii kuch binariyon main dekha ja saktaa he
 Everything that Active Directory monitors is considered an object
 ek object sakriy nirdeshika ke antargat nazar rakhaa gaya koi prayokta, system, sansaadhan, yaa seva hota he
 Common word objects are used because Active Directory is capable of tracking a wide variety of objects and many objects can share common attributes
 sakriy nirdeshika kii sanrachana, objecton kii ek padanukramit ruparekha he
 There are two broad categories of these objects: resource and safety facts
 Security facts are Active Directory objects that are assigned the unique security identifier SID used to control access and installation of security
 prayek object ek ikai — chaahe vah ek prayokta, ek computer, ek printer, yaa ek samooh ho — or iske atribyooton kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Some objects may be containers of other objects
 ek object ko vishish rup se unke naam se pahachaanaa jaataa he or isamen atribyooton kaa ek set hota he — jo aisi visheshtaayen or soochna hai jinhen object samahit kar saktaa he — jo ek skima dwaara paribhaashit hote hai jo object ke prakaar kaa bhi nirdhaaran karata he jinhen sakriy nirdeshika main sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 Each attribute object can be used in many different schema class objects
 skima object, skima ko aavashyaktaanusaar vistaarit hone yaa sanshodhit hone kii anumati pradaan karne ke liye hota he
 However, since each schema object is an integral part of the definition of an Active Directory object, deactivating or changing these objects can have serious consequences because it will fundamentally change the structure of Active Directory
 When changed, the schema object will automatically propagate through Active Directory and once it is created it can only be deactivated - but cannot be removed
 skima ko parivartit karne ke liye aam taur par ek acchhee-khaasi yojana kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 a site object in Active Directory represents a physical geographical location hosting networks
 citon main up-net naamak object hote hai
 Sites can be used to assign work to Group Policy objects, facilitate resource discovery, manage replication of Active Directory, and manage network link traffic
 citon ko anya citon se joda ja saktaa he
 Objects associated with the site can be assigned a cost value that displays the speed, reliability, availability, or other real property of the physical resource
 site kii kadiyon ko bhi ek kaarykram saunpa ja saktaa he
 The Active Directory framework that contains objects can be viewed in multiple levels
 sanrachana ke sheersh par van hota he
 a forest is a collection of rules for each object, its attributes, and Active Directory
 van, vriksh or domen ek sakriy nirdeshika network ke taarkik hisse hai
 The Active Directory forest consists of one or more infectious, trust-associated trees
 ek vriksh ek yaa ek se adhik domen or domen vriksh kaa sangrah he jo punah ek sankramak nyaas padanukram se jude hote hai
 Domains are identified by their DNS name structure, namespace
 ek domen ke antargat sthapit objecton ko contenron yaa sangraahakon main vargeekrut kar sakate hai jinhen sanghathanaatmak ikaiyaan ) kehete hai
 ouss provide a hierarchy to a domain, make its implementation easier and can provide an analogy to the organization's structure from an organizational or geographical point of view
 oyuas main oyuas ho sakate hai – vastav main, is arth main domen, container hai – or kai ekaadhik samoohikrut oyuas rakh sakate hai
 Microsoft recommends a dependency on as many domains and ous as possible in Active Directory to build policies and implementation structure and improve their implementation
 oyu vah saamaanya str he jis par samooh nitiyon ko lagu kiya jaataa he jo swayan sakriy nirdeshika ke object hote hai jinhen samooh niti objects ) kehete hai, yadhyapi nitiyon ko domenon or citon main bhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he 
 oyu vah str he jis par aam taur par vyavasthaapanaatmak shaktiyon ko saunpa jaataa he lekin iske saath hi saath vyaktigat objecton yaa atribyooton par chote-chote samarpan kaa pradarshan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 However, organizational units are just a dissociation for an administrator or administrator and do not serve as exact containers; The underlying domain therefore operates as if all objects were created in a simple flat-file structure without any ous
 udhaaharan ke taur par, do alag oyuas main ek samaan pahchaan vaale prayokta ke do prayokta khaaton jaise "fred
staff-ou

 In contrast, LDAP and Novel e-directories are exact hierarchical directories that allow the occurrence of object names in different ous
 prayek prayokta apane sandarbh: "fred

 For those users who cannot remember the context of their account, Novell provides customer log-in functionality known as contextless log-in that allows users to access all possible matches or similar user- Allows names to be found in the directory structure
 prayokta sandarbh kii avadharana sakriy nirdeshika main lagu nahin hoti he kyonki domen ke bheetar prayokta-naam kii aavriti pratham sthaan main nahin ho sakati he
 Since fake usernames cannot be present within separate ouss of an Active Directory domain, the creation of unique account names poses a significant challenge for organizations with thousands of millions of users that can be easily accessed in different domains Can not be subclassified, such as - students in a public school system or university, who are assigned entire district buildings or The riser network should be able to log into the computer
 jab ek domen main prayoktaaon kii sankhya badhati he to saral prayokta-naam ke nirmaan kii vidhiyaan jaise "pratham adyakshar, madhya adyakshar, antim naam" bekaar ho jayega kyonki usamen bahut saare ek jaise naam aa jate hai jaise samuhik jan main smith yaa johnson jiske parinamswaroop aavritiyaan yaa nakli naam aa jate hai jaise do je

 At some method of increasing number of users and name frequencies, network IT personnel can stop attempting to create privately usable usernames and the usernames simply become a sequential number 5 to 10 digits long that is the same Provides sufficient naming specificity within the domain

 Common models are by business unit, by geographic location, by IT service, or by object type

 OUS should be structured first to facilitate operational dedication and then to facilitate the application of group policy
 Although OUS creates an implementation boundary, the only precise security limit is the forest itself, and an administrator of any domain in the forest must be trusted in all domains in the forest

 Each DC has a copy of Active Directory; Which is synchronized between all DC computers by multi-faceted replication and converts on one computer
 jo sarwar sakriy nirdeshika main shaamil hote hai jo domen niyantrak nahin hai, un sarvaron ko sadsy sarwar kehete hai
 The database of Active Directory is divided into various repositories or partitions
 microsoft aksar in vibhaajanon ko "namakaran vaale sandarbhon" ke rup main sadarbhit karata hai

 If costs are low, site link bridges with a similar protocol can infect infectively between domain controllers through multiple site links, although KCC itself determines the cost of direct direct site-by-site links to infectious connections

 However, only selected attributes of each object are replicated with the aim of reducing replication traffic and keeping the GC database small

 An alternative option may be to use a second directory service such as the 389 Directory Server or Sun Java Systems Directory Server from Sun Microsystems which can use a two-way synchronization with Active Directory and thus the use of Active Directory
 As well as provide a "deflected" integration as Unix and Linux vendors will authenticate the fds and windows Clients will authenticate to the Active Directory
 As a second option, Open LDAP can be used with their translational overlay that can extend entries to any remote LDAP server with additional attributes stored in a local database

 There is a mode of photography in which a camera with a lot of electronic photodetectors is used to photograph the object specified by the lens
 This is completely different from the exposure of an object on a photographic film
 Photos taken by it can be kept in digital form as any computer file
 We can use this file for digital processing, digital publishing, viewing a photo or taking a print out of it

 According to this legend, when Indra and other gods became weak due to the curse of Maharishi Durvasa, the demons attacked and defeated the gods
 tab sab devtaa milakar bhagwaan vishnu ke paas gaye or unhe sara vrutant sunaaya
 Then Lord Vishnu along with the demons advised him to churn the Kshirsagar and extract the nectar

 At the behest of the nectar Kumbh, at the behest of the gods, Indraputra 'jayant' flew into the sky carrying the nectar-urn
 uske baad daityaguru shukracharya ke aadeshaanusaar daityon ne amrit ko waapas lene ke liye jayant kaa peechha kiya or ghor parishram ke baad unhone bich raste main hi jayant ko pakadaa
 After that, there was a continuous war for twelve days among the Devas and Demons to take control of the Amrit Kalash

 Thus Akbar realized the power of the goddess

 Fresh from the memory of India's religion-based partition in 1947, Punjabi Hindus were also concerned about living in a Sikh-dominated state
 jalandhar ke hindi samachar patron ne punjabi hinduon se hindi ko apni "maatrubhaasha" banane kaa aagrah kiya taaki unki maang ko bhashaai na bataaya ja sake
 This later caused a rift between Sikhs and Hindus of Punjab
 is maamle ko rajya punargathan ayog ke samaksh prastut kiya gaya
 The State Reorganization Commission rejected the proposal, considering Punjabi as not separate from Hindi
 ayog ne apni report main iskaa doosraa kaaran aandolan main logon ke samarthan ke abhaav ko bataaya
 According to the State Reorganization Act, Patiala and East Punjab State Association were merged with Punjab
 haalanki, rajya main abhi bhi, ek bada hindi bhashi kshetra hone ke kaaran ek spasht punjabi bahumat nahin tha
 Akali Dal leaders continued their agitation for the creation of a "punjabi state" even after the merger of Punjab and PEPSU
 akaal takht ne chunaav prachaar karne ke liye sikhon ke aayojan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai

 Ramlila is a drama based on the character of Rama traditionally played in northern India
 yah praayah vijayadashami ke avasar par khelaa jaataa he
 From the sea to Himachal, who is the original promoter of the famous Ramlila is a controversial question
 bhavuk bhakton kii drushti main yah anadi he
 a legend indicates that in the Treta Yuga, after the demise of Sri Ramachandra, the Ayodhya residents spent fourteen years of performing the leelas of Ram
 tabhi se isaki parampara kaa prachlan hua
 Another public opinion proves that its original promoter was Megha Bhagat, who is believed to be a resident of Phuthe Hanuman located in the Katuapur palace of Kashi
 ek baar purushottam ramchandra ji ne inhen swapn main darshan dekar lila karne kaa aadesh diya taaki bhakt janon ko bhagwaan ke chakshush darshan ho saken
 He got Ramlila done by getting inspiration from this
 tatprenamswaroop thik bharat milaap ke mangal avasar par aradhy dev ne apni jhalak dekar inaki kaamana purna kii
 According to the opinion of some people, Goswami Tulsidas, the founder of the acting tradition of Ramlila, started it by finding lack of mass entertainment plays in Hindi
 inaki prerana se ayodhya or kaashi ke tulsi ghat par pratham baar ramlila hui thi
 From theatrical point of view, there are three types of Ramleela - Sachal Leela, Achal Leela and Stay Leela
 kaashi nagari ke chaar sthanon main achal leelaayen hoti hai
 go
 One of the many characteristics of theater established by Tulsidas is that for the creation of naturalness, effectiveness and beauty, Ayodhya, Janakpur, Chitrakoot, Lanka etc
 were made in different places and all the leelas belonging to the same place were shown in one place
 Used to go
 yah gyatavya he ki rangashaala khuli hoti thi or paatro ko samvaad jodne ghataane main swatantraaa thi
 In this way, the credit for the reputation of Hindi theater is Go
 Tulsidas and Kashi have their work area

 The scene of the aircraft and the posts that come out in connection with Ramlila on the occasion of Dussehra of Allahabad is very grand
 lila ke paatr, kishor, yuva, praudh sabhi hote hai
 The role of Sita or Sakhis is performed by Kishore till date
 ramlila ke sabhi abhinayta praaia: brahman hote hai, kintu ab kahin kahin anya varnon ke bhi log dekhe jate hai
 Special attention is paid to Ravana's poetic grandeur, Sita's natural tenderness and eloquent softness, Shurpanakha's physical length, etc
 while choosing the characters
 lilabhinayta chaoupaayiyon, dohon ko kanthsth kiye rahete hai or yathavsar cathopakathanon main upyog kar dete hai
 Ramleela's success depends on Vyas Sutraghar, who handles it, as he directs the dynamics of the dialogues and the actors
 saath hi rangamanchi vyavastha par bhi puraa dhyaan rakhata he
 a certain method is accepted at the beginning of Ramlila
 sthaan-kaal-bhed ke kaaran vidhiyon main antar lakshith hota he
 Somewhere it is done by worshiping the crowns of God, and elsewhere it is done by legislation
 isamen ek ore paatro dwaara rup or avasthaaon kaa prastutikaran hota he, duusari ore samavet swar main maanas kaa parayan naarad-bani-style main hota chalata he
 Aarti is performed at the end of Leela
