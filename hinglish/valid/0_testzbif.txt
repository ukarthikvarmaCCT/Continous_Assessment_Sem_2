 ek ank vaale naatakon ko ekanki kehete hai
 In English for the term "one act play" both the words "ekanki Natak" and "ekanki" are treated equally
 pashchim main ekanki 20 veen shatabdi main, visheshat: pratham mahayuddh ke baad, atyant prachlit or lokapriy hua
 It was widely practiced in Hindi and other Indian languages in the fourth decade of this century
 iskaa yah arth nahin ki ekanki sahitya kii sarvatha abhijatyaheen vidha he
 Nearby forms are found in the theatrical literature of both East and West
 saskrunt naatyashaastra main nayak ke charit, itivrutt, ras aadi ke aadhaar par rupakon or uparupakon ke jo bhed kiye gaye unamem se anek ko dow kith ne ekanki naatak kaha he
 Thus the Vyayoga, Prahasana, Bhag, Veethi, Natika, Goshthi, Sattak, Natyarasak, Prakashika, Ullapya, Poetry Prakhandan, Shrigadit, Vilasika, Vesika, Halish, etc
 described in "darsarupaka" and "sahityadarpan", have metaphors and epithets near modern modern It would not be unfair to say relative
 "sahityadarpan main "ekank" shabd kaa prayog bhi hua he : Bhā :a: si धa raूर्तचरcharitोोa nanavasthaत्मकaत्मकaत्मकa :a :a।
 ekank ek evatr nipun : pandito vit:
 
 or Khyateetivritto Vyayoga: Self-woman
 hino garbhavimarshabhyaan nararbahubhirashrith:
 
 ekankkasch bhavet


 The earliest and undeveloped but closely contested form of modern Ekanki in the Natyasakhyatya of the West is "interlude"
 15veen or 16veen shatabdiyon main prachlit sadachaar or naitik shikshapurna angreji morality naatakon ke kore upadesh se paidaa hui ub ko dur karne ke liye prahasanpurn ansh bhi jod die jate hai
 Such segments were called interludes
 kramash: ye morality naatakon se swatantra ho gaye or ant main unki parinti vyangy-vinod-pradhan teen paatro ke chote naatakon main hui
 Called "curtain Razor" or Patonnayak, one who can be compared to the philanthropist or observer of Sanskrit plays was the closest predecessor to modern units in the West
 raatri main der se khaanaa khaane ke baad rangashaalaon main aanevaale sambhraant saamaajikon ke kaaran samay se aanevaale saadhaaran saamaajikon ko badi asuvidha hoti thi
 The owners of the theater, meanwhile, began to offer bipartisan hilarious dialogues to keep ordinary socials engaged in entertainment
 is prakaar ke swatantra samvaad ko hi "kartin reiser' kaha jaataa tha
 It lacked plot and real and dramatic duality of life
 baad main "kartin reiser' ke sthaan par yatharth jivan ko lekar sugathit kathanak or naatakeey dwandwavaale chote naatak prastut kiye jane lage
 The next step in their development was modern acanci
 ekanki itnaa lokapriy ho uthaa ki bade naatakon kii raksha karne ke liye vyavsaayik rangashaalaon ne use apane yahan se nikaalnaa shuru kiya
 But seeing the possibilities of experimentation and development in it, in many countries of the West, unconventional and experimental theater movements adopted it
 landan, paris, berlin, dublin, chicago, neuyark aadi ne is nae dhang ke naatak or uske rangamanch ko aage badhaayaa
 Apart from this, Ekanki drama got the strength of many great or respected writers of the west
 aise lekhakon main rus ke chesav, gorki or acrinov, france ke jiroudo, sartra or enil, germany ke toler or brekht, italy ke pirandeli tathaa england, ireland or america ke askar wild, galsvardi, je
em
bairi, lard dansaini, sinj, shiaan o' kasee, ujin o'nil, noel carward, tii
es
iliyat, christopher frai, graham green, miller aadi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Because of the theatrical movements and the combined and indomitable experimental courage and enthusiasm of these writers, modern unity became completely new, independent and articulated
 unki kritiyon ke aadhaar par ekanki naatakon kii saamaanya visheshtaon kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 The morphological difference of large plays and units becomes apparent on the surface itself
 ekanki naatak saadhaarant: 20 se lekar 30 minute main pradarshit kiye ja sakate hai, jabaki teen, chaar yaa paanch ankonvaale naatakon ke pradarshan main kai ghante lagate hai
 But the fundamental difference between big plays and units is creative rather than morphological
 pashchim ke teen se lekar paanch ankonvaale naatakon main do yaa do se adhik kathankon ko goonth diya jaataa tha
 Thus they had one major plot and one or several sub-plots
 sanskrit naatakon main bhi aise upakthanak hote the
 In such plays a continuous change in place or scene, period and events was natural
 lekin ekanki main yah sambhav nahin
 Ekanki is based on a dramatic event or mental state and concentration of influence is its main goal
 isliye ekanki main sthaan, samay or ghatana kaa sankalantray anivaary sa mana gaya he
 Like story and song, the art of Ekanki is the art of density or concentration and frugality, in which maximum effect is produced with the help of minimal equipment
 ekanki ke kathanak kaa pariprekshya atyant sankuchit hota he, ek hi mukhya ghatana hoti he, ek hi mukhya charitra hota he, ek charmotkarsh hota he
 Instead of long speeches and elaborate interpretations, there is dialogue
 bade naatak or ekanki kaa gunatmak bhed isi se spasht ho jaataa he ki bade naatak ke kalevar ko kaat chhantakar ekanki kii rachana nahin kii ja sakati, jis tarah ekanki ke kalevar ko khinch tanakar bade naatak kii rachana nahin kii ja sakati
 According to Sanskrit Natyasastra, five stages have been considered for the development of the plot of the big drama: beginning, effort, attainment, destiny and flourishing
 pashchim ke naatyashaastra main bhi inhen se bahut kuch milti julati sthitiyon kaa ullekh he : aarambh yaa bhoomika, charitron or ghatnaon ke ghaat pratighaat yaa dwandv se kathanak kaa charmotkarsh kii ore aaroh, charmotkarsh, avaroh or ant
 Duality is heavily emphasized in the dramatics of the West
 vastut: naatak dwandv kii kala he; katha main charitron or ghatnaon ke kramik vikaas kii jagah bade naatak main kuch charitron ke jivan ke dwandvon ko udghaatit kar kathanak ko charmotkarsh par pahunchaaya jaataa he
 The axis of this climax in Ekanki is only a duality
 bade naatak ke kathanak main dwandvon kaa vikaas kaaphi dhimaa ho saktaa he, jisamen sari ghatnaayen rangamanch par prastut hoti hai, yaa us ghatana se kuch hi purv hota he jo bade veg se dwandv ko charmotkarsh par pahunchaa detii he
 Often this climax is the end of unity
 jivan kii samasyaon ke yathartwaadee or manovaigyanik chithran ke atirikt rachanavidhan kii yah visheshta aadhunik ekanki ko sanskrit or pashchimi natya sahitya main uske nikatavarti roopon se pruthak karti he
 Often the adaptation of stories to acting creates the illusion that Ekanki is the actor's form of the story
 lekin rachanavidhan main ghanatv or mitvyayta kii aadharbhoot samanta ke baavjood kahani or ekanki main shilpagat bhed he
 Being a proverb, acting and storytelling are of paramount importance in Ekanki
 inhen ke madhyam se ekanki charitrachitran, kathanak or uske dwandv, vaataavaran or ghatnaon ke anubandh kaa nirmaan karata he
 Like story, Ekanki cannot take shelter of narration
 lekin abhinay kii ek mudra kahani ke lambey varnan se adhik prabhaavshaalee ho sakati he
 Therefore theater is both the extent and power of unicameral
 isaki pahchaan na hone ke kaaran anek safal kahanikar asafal ekankikar rah jate hai
 Similarly, it is illusionary to consider interesting discourse or narrative on a subject as one
 jivan ke yatharth, ghatana yaa kathanak, charitron ke dwandv, sankalantray ityadi ke abhaav main sambhaashan keval sambhaashan rah jaataa he, use ekanki kii sangya nahin di ja sakati
 Due to the amazing possibilities of Ekanki, it has developed in many directions in modern times
 radio roopak, sangeet tathaa kavyarupak or monolog yaa swagat natya in nai dishaao kii kuch mahatvapurn uplabdhiyaan hai
 Through radio, all these are constantly being used in the field
 rangamanch, sadeh abhinaytaon or abhinetriyon, unke abhinay or mudraon ke abhaav main radio roopak ko shabd or unki dhwani tathaa chitratmak shakti kaa adhik se adhik upyog karnaa padataa he
 The lack of tangible instruments is not merely an obstacle to the radio metaphor, as the separation of word and sound from their tangible bases can focus the attention of the playwright's audience on the characters' internal duality
 radio roopak mushkil se 50 varsh purana rup he
 In the early stages, a story was presented in the voices of many people and in order to create the illusion of theater, a detailed description of the characters' shapes, costumes, furnishings, interests, etc
 was attempted to create a real atmosphere
 america, germany, england aadi pashchimi deshon main radio ekanki ke prayogon ne uske rup ko viksit kiya or nikharaa
 Many famous American and English poets wrote poems for radio
 unamem maiklish, steefen vincent bene, karl, sandvarg, tirom gthru, looyee mcnes, saikavil west, patric dickinson, dealan tamas aadi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Inspired by these experiments, Hindi and other Indian language analysts have also presented radio metaphors, geetinatyas and poetics
 par inamen abhi anek trutiyaan hai
 Historians of Hindi literature consider Ekanki's beginning with Bharatendu Yuga
 prasad ke "ek ghunt' se doosraa charan, bhubaneshwaraprasad ke "kaaravaan' se teesraa tathaa dow ramkumar verma ke "reshmi taai' sankalan se chauthe charan kii shuruuaat kahi gai he
 But the said division does not include those integrators who started writing around 1955 AD and are still writing today
 at: hindi ekanki kaa adhyatan itihaas sankshep main is prakaar he : Two types of acacia were written in Bharatendula
 pratham, anudit yaa chhaayankit ekanki tathaa dwitiya, moulik ekanki
 In the first category, Bharatendu translated Bagla's "bharatmata" as "bharat Janani"; Bangla's translation of "bharather Yavan" by Radhacharan Goswami is "yavan people in Bharatvarsha", Kanchanacharya's cinematic metaphor of "dhananjaya Vijay", Ayodhyasim Upadhyay's "pradyumnvijaya Vyayoga" etc

 The historical narrative and the context of social reform are the subjects of the above units
 inhen aadhunik ekanki kaa praanrabhik rup kaha ja saktaa he
 These are not developed in the form of art; The styles are somewhat different but the tradition is the same
 ukt ekanki abhinaeya kii apeksha pathay adhik hai
 The authors lean toward describing the totality of life; They do not get the subtle distortion of vrittis
 prarochana, prastaavna, sutaradhar, naandi, mangalacharan, ekaadhik drishyayojna, bharatvakya aadi ke prayog kahin hai, kahin nahin bhi hai
 The shapes are ubiquitous, the points also become visual and visual like conceptions
 sankalantray ke nirvaah kaa abhaav he, shithil sanvaadon kaa bahulya evam vikaas tathaa vinyasaheen kathayojna kaa aadhiky he
 Some of these are written as farce, but the amount of satire is more than pure humor
 ekanki ke liye apekshit pramukh gun kaary kaa inamen abhaav he
 In the second era of Ekanki, "a sip" of Jaishankar Prasad was written which also has the influence of Sanskrit and the western Ekanki craft that came through Bengali
 prasad ji ne isi bich "kalyani parinay' bhi likhaa, par vah abhi tak aprakashit he
 Also, it can also be called a part of his "chadrangupta" drama

 Almost all modern characteristics of aconite are found in "one sip"

 But "one sip" remained the same; it could not divert other writers to unicorn writing
 ekanki kaa teesraa charan bhubaneshwaprasad ke "kaaravaan' sangrah se shuru hota he jisamen chah ekanki hai
 In 1938, the one-off issue of "hans" was published
 isamen tatkaaleen pratinidhi ekanki prastut kiye gaye
 Meanwhile, Satyendra's "kunal", Prithivnath Sharma's "dilemma", Ramkumar Varma's "prithviraj's Eyes"; Surya Sharan Pareek's "bailavana or Pratibhapurti" were published
 udaishankar bhatta, seth govinddas prabhruti ekankikar bhi isi kaal main ekanki lekhan kii ore pravrutt hue or unke kai shashakt ekanki prakaash main aae
 In this era, Ekanki was written about both famous and productive stories
 inamen vivaahadi saamaajik tathaa samyavadadi raajnneetik samasyaayen pramukh rup se ubhari hai
 The ancient ideology has been strongly advocated, but with it the urge to adopt new one is also clear
 pashchimi vichaar ore style ke prabhaav ko lekar ekanki ne apane rup rang main paryaapt parivartan kiya or isaki takanic main yatkinchit sthirataa ai
 If seen, this period was the cleansing period of Ekanki mode
 lekhakon ne is samay kaa sadupyog kar apane haath saadhe
 Since 1935 AD, units were also being given place under radio broadcasts, hence Radio Ekanki or Soundnatak were also written in large numbers
 chaturth charan tak pahonchte-pahonchte ekanki kaa swaroop, shilp aadi puri tarah sthir ho jate hai, unka pramanik rup saamne aata he
 Earlier, he was trying to find his right form

 He could not kill Harry with his current wand because the axes of his and Harry's wand were the same, so after Lucius Melfoy failed to kill Harry with a stick, he would search for the world's most powerful stick Elder wand
 So that he can overcome Harry's wand and become invincible
 vah is kaary ko puraa karne ke liye gregorovich chadi kii dukaan par jaataa he or chadi banane vaale kii hatya kar detaa he

 Harry voluntarily goes to the woods near Voldemort where Voldemort Elder attacks him with a stick
 kyonki voldemort harry ke hi sharir se punerjeevit hua tha, isaliye harry kaa rakt uski dhamniyon main daud rahaa tha isaliye harry kii maan kii suraksha kaa bhaag uske sharir main bhi aa gaya tha

 Not obeying Harry, Voldemort uses the Death Penalty Curse from the Elder Wand, but the Elder Wand does not kill his master; For this reason, the mantra returns to him and Voldemort, whose Horcrux had already been destroyed, eventually dies

 She stopped brewing with this hope because she did not want to live her untrue life any longer and she also wanted her husband Tom to love her genuinely, as well as hope that her husband at least Will stop being in love with your unborn child
 lekin aisa nahin hota he or tom sachai pataa lagate hi use chhod kar chalaa jaataa he
 Frustrated with all these developments, Meropi starts wandering the streets of London
 ab uske paas keval khandaani sone kaa lacket bachaa tha, jo ki uske purvaj salaajaar slidarin kaa tha, usne kam keemat main bech diya
 When she was about to give birth to her son, she somehow arrives at the Magalu orphanage, where her son Tom Marvolo Riddle is born

 After living with her for 12 years, Islot stole Garmlath's wand and she fled to the American colony and moved to Massachusetts
 vahaan par usne ilvermorni jaadu tona or tantra mantra vidhyalay main daakhila le liya
 When Gormlath finds out this, she follows her niece to Massachusetts where she is murdered by Islot's friend

 After Rolling regained his body in the fourth edition of the novel, Voldemort was left with pale skin, a white face like a chalice, a snake-like nasal cavity, a red-eyed and cat-like gullible, skeleton-like body, and unnaturally long fingers
 He is shown with big and thin hands
 upanyaas ke saatven sanskaran ke pehle adhyay ke anusaar uske paas bal tathaa hont bhi nahin the
 According to the stories seen by Smriti Patra in the past in the second and sixth editions, he was beautiful and tall with pale skin, jet black hair and dark brown eyes
 vah apane luk se sabhi ko aakarshith kar saktaa tha
 It is speculated that the reason for his becoming a human being was to divide his soul into a Horcrux in his desire to become immortal
 film main voldemort kii aankhe neeli tathaa pupil golakaar he
 Rolling describes Voldemort as "the worst wizard of hundreds of years"
 unhone use "atyadhik manorogi, anya logon kii pidaa par manushyik pratikriya kaa abhavi" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 At the same time, he has been shown to be the slayer of others, especially the Maghuls, because of his happiness
 uske andar chetana kaa abhaav tha, vah apane kiye par use koi pachhtaawaa nahin hota tha tathaa vah apane atirikt insaaniyat kaa mahatva bhi nahin samajhataa tha
 He neither liked to establish companionship or friendship with man nor did he have any love or affection for anyone
 vah swayan ko shreshth samajhataa tha or apane saamne sabhi ko hin maanata tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was "a truly starving, racist of incredible strength"
 agar vah khwaish darpan main dekhtaa to vah swayan ko "sarvashaktimaan or avinashi" ke rup main dekhtaa jaisaa vah chahta tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was born as a result of a love decoction by his mother and sorceress Meropi Gaunt on a Magaloo and his father Tom Riddle, a result of a failed love
 kaadhe kaa asar khatm hone va pita ke uski maan ko chhod dene ke kaaran uski maan kii mrityu ho jaati he, lekin agar uski maan jivit rahati or use pyaar detii to avashya sab kuch badal gaya hota
 The attraction that led to the transformation of the boy born as Tom Riddle to Voldemort is very necessary because it shows the concept that led to this character
 lagbhag sabhi khalnaayakon ke samaan, voldemort kaa dambh hi uske patan kaa kaaran banataa he
 He was extremely afraid of death, which he described as a shameful and disgusting human weakness
 uske andar ahamkaari hone ke kai lakshan the
 In front of his life-worshipers, Voldemort confesses that he paid the great price for the attack on Harry's parents, and then observes what went wrong, and in the end he takes the blame on himself
 rolling ne yah likhaa he ki uskaa bahurupia uski antim yatra hoti
 Rolling states the difference between Voldemort and Harry, stating that Harry had accepted death, for this reason he eventually emerged stronger than he was
 puri shrunkhlaa main rolling ne voldemort ko atyadhik shaktishaalee, budhimaan or nirmam dusht jaadugar bataaya he
 He could read others' minds well and also prevent others from entering his own mind
 dambaldor ke atirikt vah ek maatr aisa gyaat jaadugar tha jo chup chaap chhu-mantar ho jaataa tha
 Voldemort feared Dumbledore, the only magician
 antim pustak main voldemort ko bina kisi sahare ke udata dikhaaya gaya, jisane bhi yah padhaa yaa dekha vah achambhit rah gaya
 Like his ancestors, he could also talk to snakes in snake language
 use yah kaushal apane purvaj salaajaar slidarin se mila
 The Gaunt family also used this language in their own conversation
 yah asaadhaaran lakshan usame sambhavtah anuvanshik rup se aa gaya ho, kyonki gont parivaar main yah parampara rakt kii shuddhta banaaye rakhane ke liye nibhaai jaati thi
 When Voldemort attempts to assassinate the newborn Harry, Harry's art of speaking in snake language along with part of his soul also goes away
 jab vah aatma kaa hissaa harry main mar jaataa he to harry main yah shakti khatm ho jaati he
 While watching an old story in the sixth part, Voldemort claimed during a job interview in front of Dumbledore that he had "increased the limits of magic more than ever"

 Ancient Egypt was one of the oldest civilizations in the world
 ek sahasrabdi tak misr kii atyant jatil or sthir samskruti bani rahi
 It influenced the later cultures of Europe, Central Asia and Africa

 In theory, they were the surveyors of the state
 ve na keval rajdhyaksh hote the varan sarvocch, senapati, sarvocch pujari or sarvocch nyaayadhish bhi hote the
 But in practice the wishes of the feudal lords, priests, influential office bearers and favorite nobles and the traditions of the state controlled their autocracy

 The most powerful person in the state after the Ferrars was the Prime Minister

 These were actually the ancient kingdoms which were unified to establish the first two kingdoms of the First Dynasty - northern and southern
 lekin ab in par swatantra raajaaon ke sthaan par pherao dwaara niyukt governor rajya karte the
 The power of provincial governors and feudatories increased especially in the Middle Ages and that of the emperor in the imperial era
 misri samaaj paanch virgo main vibhajit tha : rajpariwaar, samant, pujari, madhyamvarg tathaa surf or das
 The land was theoretically in the hands of the pharaoh
 vyavhaar main usne ise adhikanshat: pujaariyon, puraane raajaaon ke vanshajon or saamanton main vibhajit kar diya tha
 In their big fiefdoms, slaves and serfs worked
 madhyam varg main lipic, vyapaaree, karigar or swatantra kisaan sammilit the
 In the ancient state era, the highest reputation was that of the royal family, the feudatories and the priests
 madhya rajya yug main saamanton ke saath madhyam varg ko mahatv mila tathaa samrajya yug main sainik varg ko
 The class system was surprisingly flexible
 har vyakti koi bhi pesha apana saktaa tha
 Only members of the royal family were deprived of this right
 surf bhi praaia: ucch padon par pahunch jate the
 But there was a huge difference in the living standards of the upper and lower class people
 dhani log vishaal hawaadaar bhawanon main rahete the or nirdhan gande mohalle kii choti choti jhopadiyon main
 The unit of the society was the family
 vidhyanusaar prayek vyakti kii keval ek patni ho sakati thi or usee kii santan ko pariwarik sampatti uttaradhikaar main milti thi
 Ferro was also no exception to this rule
 lekin samrudh purush anek upapatniyaan rakhte the
 In every section of the Egyptian society, marriage of brother and sister was the practice, so husband wife had affection from childhood itself
 samaaj main striyon ko atyant pratishthit sthaan praapt tha
 According to Max Müller no other race conferred on women as high a statutory honor as the Egyptians

 They often imagined their gods as humans or animal birds or mixed forms

 He considered not only the Sun, the Moon and the Nile River, but also the springs, mountains, fauna, latakunjas, trees and diverse flora, possessed with divine power
 akaash kii kalpana unhone nut naam kii daivi athwa hathor naam kii daivi gau ke rup main kii thi
 The chief deity of Memphis was the patron of arts and artists, not the divineization of any natural power
 surya kii upasna misr main lagbhag sabhi jagah vibhinn naamon or roopon main hoti thi
 In northern Egypt, the main center of his worship was a place called On
 yahan use re kaha jaataa tha or uski kalpana pashchim kii ore gaman karte hue vruddh purush ke rup main kii gai thi
 His name was Theman in Thebes
 dakshini misr main uskaa pramukh kendra edfu naamak sthaan tha
 There, he was worshiped as eagle named Horus
 sanyukt rajya kii sthapana hone par surya ke in vibhinn roopon ko abhinn mana jane laga or uskaa sanyukt naam emon-re lokapriy ho gaya
 His emblem was the Egyptian emblem of the 'favored trench wheel'
 mixriyon ke vishwaas ke anusaar sabase pehle usee ne pheraon ke rup main shashan kiya tha
 When Suryadev became sky-high, his representatives began to rule the earth
 inamen sabase pehla sthaan osieris ko diya gaya he
 Although at some places he has also been called the son of the sun, yet he appears to be the divineization of the Nile River, the fertility of the earth and the greenness
 ek naresh ke rup main vah atyant paropkaaree or nyaaypriy siddh hua
 He was greatly assisted by his sister and wife Isis in the reign
 uske dusht bhrata set ne uski dhokhe se hatya kar di
 Isis later gave birth to a son named Horus

 After attaining youth, Horus overthrows Seth by fierce struggle and retaliates for his father's humiliation and slaughter

 During the empire era, the priestly class became extremely rich and ruling
 isse madhya rajya yug main dharm or sadachaar main jo ghanishtha sambandh sthapit hua tha vah tut gaya
 Now the patrons of religion themselves started living a life of indulgence
 'devataaon' ke manoranjak ke hetu niyukt devdasiyaan vastut: unka hi manoranjan karti thim
 Now he started claiming to the dead the fear of the hereafter, claiming that if he wanted, he could also bring the sinners to heaven with the help of his magic

 These certificates can be compared to piety certificates sold by Christian priests in medieval Europe
 misri dharm kii yah vah avasthaa thi jab 1375 i0 pus0 main amenhotep chaturth misr kaa adhishwar bana
 From the beginning he opposed corruption spread in the priestly class and his undesirable influence on politics and tried to popularize the worship of a new god named Aten
 uski prashansa main usne apana naam bhi akhnaton rakh liya
 Aten was originally the name of Suryadev Ray
 lekin akhnaton ne use keval misr kaa hi nahin, samast vishwa kaa ekmaatr devtaa bataaya
 Because Eton was formless, Akhnaton did not make his idols
 lekin jansadharan uski mahima ko hridyangam kar sake, isaliye usne 'suryachakr' ko uskaa pratik mana
 The worship of Eton did not require much offerings, nor did complex rituals, tantrums, and crowds of priests
 keval hriday se aton ke aabhaar ko maananaa or uski stuti karte hue shraddha ke pratik rup kuch patr, pushp or fal chadhaanaa paryaapt tha
 There is no imagery of hell in his hereafter because he could not even imagine that the merciful father Eton could cause hellish suffering to anyone
 akhnaton ne prarambh main anya devataaon ke prati sahishnutaa kaa vyavhaar kiya kintu pujaariyon ke ugr virodh par usne anya devataaon ke mandiron ko band karvaa diya
 Their priests were expelled, ordered their subjects to worship only Etan and erased the names of all the gods written on public monuments
 lekin akhnaton ke vichaar or kaary uske samay ke anukool nahin the
 So his religion ended with his death
 uske baad, uske damaad tuutenkhatan ne puraane dharm ko pun: pratishthit kiya, pujaariyon ke adhikaar lautaa die or apana naam badalakar tuutenkhamen rakh liya
 The ancient Egyptian script is called the pictographic script
 'hyroglife' unani shabd he
 It means 'holy mark'
 is lipi main kul milakar lagbhag 2000 chitrakshar the
 Some of these pictures have various shapes of humans etc
 ye chihn teen prakaar ke hai: bhavabodhak, dhvanibodhak tathaa sanketasuchak
 While making the paintings, an attempt was made to mark the exact form of the objects, so it took a lot of time to write it
 is kathinaayee ko dur karne ke liye pratham vansh ke shasankaal main hi mixriyon ne ek prakaar kii drut athwa ghaseet lipi kaa vikaas kar liya tha
 The Egyptians had also succeeded in inventing an alphabet of 24 letters in the ancient state era
 unhone varnmaala ko bhavabodhak or ghvanibodhak chitro se sahaayak rup main prayukt kiya, swatantra madhyam ke rup main nahin
 Around the eighth century BCE, the Egyptians invented a script written sooner than the 'hieratic script', which is called 'dimatic'
 yah ek prakaar kii shorthand lipi kahi ja sakati he
 Papyrus was a common means of writing in Egypt since ancient times
 charmpatron ko tathaa mridbhandon ke tukdon ko bhi likhane ke liye kaam main laayaa jaataa tha
 His paintings were also made from the writings of Narkul and also from Brush
 misri sahitya prakrutya vyaavhaarik tha
 Most of his works are written to serve some practical purpose
 isiliye ve mahakavyon, naatakon or yahan tak ki sahityak drushti se aakhyaanon kii bhi rachana kabhi nahin kar paae
 All the narratives he discusses were popular only as folklores until the end of the imperial era
 unako kabhi pruthak saahitiyik kritiyon ke rup main lipibaddh nahin kiya gaya
 Typical religious compositions of the Pyramid era are pyramid textiles
 inamen mritak sanskaar main kaam aane vaale ve mantra, poojagit or prarthanaayen aadi sammilit hai jinhen mrit pherao ke parloukik jivan ko sankat rahit karne ke liye uske piremidon kii bhittiyon par utkeern kar diya jaataa tha
 These were followed by the development of 'coffin Texts' and 'book of the Dead'
 shesh sahitya bhi prakrutya vyaavhaarik he
 For example, ministers like Imhotep, Kagemne and Ta: Hotep, wrote their empirical knowledge
 ye kritiyaan 'nitigranth' kehalaati hai
 In the Middle Kingdom era compositions, 'the application of the vocal cultivator', 'the prophecy of the Ipuvre', the preaching of Amenmhet 'and the' anthem of the harpist 'are prominent, and the hymns of Akhnatan in the imperial era works
 vigyaan ke keval unheen kshetron main mixriyon kii ruchi thi jinaki vyaavhaarik jivan main aavashyaktaa padati thim
 Despite limited curiosity, he achieved surprising success in some areas
 udaahranarth unhone grahon or nakshatron kii sthiti kaa kaaphi sahi andaaj karke akaash kaa maanchitr bana liya tha
 His significant breakthrough was the invention of the solar almanac
 ganit ke mukhya niyam jod, ghataana or bhaag vyapaar or prashasan sambandhi aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye kaaphi pehle avishkrut ho chuke the
 But by multiplication they remained unfamiliar until the end
 iskaa kaam ve jod se chalaate the
 He was also unfamiliar with the zero and decimal method
 bijganit or rekhganit kii praathmik samasyaon ko hal karnaa unhen aa gaya tha, lekin visham chaturbhuj kaa kshetrafal nikaalane main dikkat kaa anubhav karte the
 Much success was achieved in finding the area of circle, semi-circle and cylinder
 bhawanon kii aadharyojna banane main ve asaadhaaran rup se kushal the
 His artisans were familiar with the use of pillars and arches
 chikitsashastra main bhi unhone paryaapt pragati kar lee thi
 For Egyptians, art was a medium to express their national life
 iskaa sarvottam pramaan unke piramid hai
 Some scholars say that the Egyptian King had built them to give employment to the public when the state's economic system deteriorated
 lekin yah asambhav lagata he
 Egypt was a prosperous country at the time these pyramids were built, so their construction can be considered as the cause of economic organization, not the result
 vastav main mixriyon ne piremidon kii rachana apane rajya or uske pratik pheraon kii anshvarata or gaurav ko abhivyakt karne ke liye kii thi
 If the Pherons were immortal, then it was necessary to build huge and permanent mausoleums according to their importance for the protection and residence of their dead bodies
 herrodotus ke anusaar gijeh ke 'vishaal piramid' ko ek lakh vyaktiyon ne bees saal main banaaya tha
 It is built on thirteen acres of land and is 480 feet high and 755 feet tall
 isamen dhai dhai ton bhaar ke 23 pashankhand lage hai
 These are so cleverly added that the width of the joint is less than a thousandth of an inch
 samrajya yug main misri vaastukala kaa pradarshan mandiron kaa nirmaan main hua
 Like the Pyramids, these temples are often built with the hardest stone and are extremely large
 kanark kaa mandir sambhavat: vishwa kaa vishaltam bhawan he
 It is 1300 feet long
 iskaa madhyavarti kaksh 170 foot lanbaa or 338 foot chaudaa he
 Its roof rests on 136 pillars made of six rows with twelve intermediate columns of 79 feet high and each can have a hundred persons standing on the head
 misri nubia main nirmit abu simbel kaa mandir vastut: ek guhaamandir he
 It is 175 feet long and 90 feet high
 iske madhyavarti kaksh kii chat 20 foot unche 8 stambhon par aadhaarit he jinke saath osieris kii 17 foot unchi murtiyan bani he
 The temple of Luxor was built by Amenhotep III
 kintu vah ise puraa nahin kar paaya
 Like architecture, spaciousness, soundness and conservatism were also characteristic of Egyptian sculpture
 raajaaon kii murtiyan adhikanshat: kathor pashaan se vishaal aakaar or bhav-viheen mudra main banaai jaati thim
 He is often shown by hanging his legs in a chair to straighten the spine and hands in the posture of sitting on the thighs or with the left leg hanging forward
 thatamos tritiy or remesis dwitiya kii murtiyan to akaash ko chooti lagati he
 The huge statue called 'sphiks' located in front of the pyramid of Khefe is probably the largest statue in the world
 iskaa sharir singh kaa he or sir pherao khafre kaa
 Among these are some sculptures made during the period of Akhnatan, in which the idols of Akhnatan himself and his queen Nafroteti are particularly notable
 iske nirmaataa kalakaar puraani paramparaon ke bandhanon se mukt the
 Some such idols of common people have also been found
 inamen kahiraa sangrahalay main surakshit pracheen rajya ke ek oversier kii kashtha kii pratimaa, jiskaa keval sir avshisht he, bahut prasiddh he
 It is known as 'sheikh's idol'
 lubre sangrahalay kii 'lipic kii murti' bhi atyant pranavan prathit hoti he
 In Egypt, there was also a great demand for artists making relief paintings in temples and mastaba
 aisi murtiyan banaate samay ankit vastu kii lambaai chaudaai to aasaani se dikhaa di jaati thi, lekin motaai athwa golai dikhaane main dikkat hoti thi
 Therefore, his relief paintings have become quite unnatural
 lekin is dosha ke baavjood misri relif chitra darshneey hai or pracheen misri sabhyataa or reeti rivaajon par gyanavarddhak prakaash daalate hai
 Most of the specimens of Egyptian painting have been destroyed, but the remainder remain unaffected by religious and political conventions
 aisa lagata he, misr main chitrakala kaa janm piramid yug main ho jane par bhi vikaas kaaphi baad main hua
 Therefore, this art remained outside the purview of religion
 misri chitrakala ke uplabdh namoonon main sarvottam akhnaton ke samay ke hai
 Apart from painting, the imperial Egyptians had also become proficient in many other fine arts
 tuutenkhamen kii 1922 i0 main utkhanit samadhi se ab se lagbhag 3300 varsh purv chode gaye bahumoolya kashtha, charm or swarna nirmit furniture upkaran, aabnoos or hastidant khachit baks, swarna or bahumoolya pashaanon se sajjit rath, swarnapatrmandit singhaasana, shwet pashaan ke sundar bhaand tathaa jari ke sundar shahi vastra, uplabdh hue hai
 These reveal the progress and splendor of the art of imperial Egypt

 nasadasin no sadasit tadanin nasid rajo no vayomaparo yat |kimavarivah kuh kasy sharmannambhah kimasid gahanan gabhiram || sristi se pehle sat nahin tha asat bhi nahin antariksh bhi nahin The sky was not even hidden, what did it cover, where was it even in the next unbroken water, who is the creator of the world? Is the subject or the seller? He always remains the president in high sky, he really knows or does not even know, no one does not know, does not know, he did not know, he was the same as the lord of all the ghosts that existed before creation; Wearing such a god whom we worship, by giving strength to which the light is bright, Amber, the earth is full of green, the heaven and the sun is also stable
 We switch to serve those whom God as your fire cause to hold the trade waters around who wake up at the bottom and comprises a life in the womb by Hvi we h by Hvi! Creation creator, yahaan upar jo shabd diye gayi hai "jagaa chuke va ekmev praan banakar" vahiin shabd kain sari websits par hai
 In many places, such words as "having awakened and become one and only life", also appear
 yah dono panktiyaan / shabdarchanaayen galat hai
 Here the line has been given in many places like Jagaa chuke vo ka ekameva pran bankar in English
 in panktiyon kaa koi bhi matlab nahin banataa
 The correct line is "wake up as the only soul of the gods"

 antarrashtriya vittiya prativedan maanak, antarrashtriya lekhankan maanak board dwaara apanaae gaye maanak, pratipaadan or ruparekha he
 Many of the standards for the formation of IFRS are known as the International Accounting Standards
 antarrashtriya lekhankan maanak samiti ke dwaara antarrashtriya lekhankan maanak san 1973 or 2001 ke bich jari kiye gaye
 On 1 April 2001, the new IASB took over the responsibility of setting international accounting standards from the IASC
 naye board ne apni pehali baithak ke dauraan maujuuda IAS or sics ko apanaaya
 IASB ne apane maanakon ke vikaas kii prakriya ko nae maanakon IFRS ke naam se jari rakhaa
 IFRS is considered to be a set of "ideals-based" standards in which special rules have been established for expanded rules and their remedies
 antarrashtriya vittiya prativedan maanakon ke antargat samavisht hai: There is also a framework for undertaking and establishing financial statements that explain the objectives contained in IFRS
 IAS 8 anuchhed 11 "in making the decision mentioned in Article 10, management has to consider the applicability of the following sources in the following order: maanakon or pratipadanon kii aavashyaktaaen evam maargdarshansmaan or sambandhit muddon se nipatane ke liye; or Definitions, criteria for recognition and concepts of scale, which outline the assets, liabilities, income and expenditure
 "' The outline of the undertaking and placement of the financial statements presents the fundamentals of IFRS
 IASB kahata he ki: In the absence of particularly applicable standards or representations in transactions, management must use accounting policy development and decision making practices that result in relevant and reliable information
 aisa nirnay lene main, IAS 8
11 prabandhan ko paribhaashaon, manyata maandand or ruparekha main aastiyon, deytaon, aay evam vyay ke mapankan kii avadharanaon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The lifting of the importance of the framework was added in 2003 to the amendment of the 8th Article of the IAS
 ruparekha hi lekhankan ke maanakon kii buniyaad he
 According to the framework, the purpose of financial statements is to inform about the financial position of an entity, its performance and financial changes which are useful in making economic decisions to the users at large and to inform the shareholders and general public about the current financial situation
 is
 IFRS main vyavahrut antarnihit dharanaen is prakaar hai: The qualitative characteristics of the financial statements described in the outline are: kisi udhyam kii vittiya sthiti prathamtah uske tulan patr main prastut kii jaati he
 The elements of the balance sheet or the elements that assess the financial position are: 1
 aasti : aasti udhyam dwaara niyantrit sansaadhan he jo vigat ghatnaon kaa pratifal he or jisase udhyam ko bhavishya main hone vaale aarthik laabhon kii apekshaayen hai
 2
 Liability: Liability is the present obligation arising from the past events of the enterprise, the settlement of which is the result of the resources being excluded from the enterprise, eg, the assets
 3
 equity : kisi udhyam kii aastiyon se sabhi deytaon ko ghataane ke baad avshisht byaaj ko hi equity kehete hai
 Equity is also called owner's equity
 kisi udhyam kaa vittiya nishpaadan prathamtah aay ke vivaran athwa laabh or haani lekha main darshaya jaataa he
 Elements of income statement or income that measure financial performance are as follows: 4
 rajasav : lekhankan kii avadhi ke dauraan nivesh athwa aastiyon main badhottaree ke parinamswaroop aarthik laabh main vruddhi yaa deytaon main kami ke kaaran equity main vruddhi hoti he
 However, this excludes contributions from equity participants, such as owners, partners and share holders
 5
 vyay : lekhankan kii avadhi ke dauraan bahirvah ke rup main aarthik laabhon main hvaas athwa aastiyon main avakshay yaa deytaon main vyay bhaar jiske falswaroop equity main hvaas hota he
 An item is identified in the financial statement when: anuchhed 99
 maapan maudrik rakam ko nirdhaarit karne kii prakriya he jis par vittiya vivaranon ke tattvon kii pahchaan kii jaati he tathaa tulan patr or aay ke vivaran main aage le jaayi jaati he
 This selects the particular basis of measurement
 anuchhed 100
 vittiya vivaranon main maapan ke kai prakaar ke aadhaar bhinn staron main or badalte hue sanyojanon main niojit hote hai
 They include the following: aitihaasik laagat
 aastiyon ko unke abhigrahan ke samay nakad yaa nakad raashi ke samatuly bhugtan kii gai raashi yaa unhen arjeet karne ke liye die gaye pratifal ke uchit mulya par abhilikhit kiya jaataa he
 In the general direction of business, liabilities are recorded on receipt of the obligation exchange or, in some circumstances, cash payments or cash equivalents are required to compensate for liability
 vartmaan laagat
 nakad raashi yaa nakad ke samatuly jinka bhugtan kiya janaa he agar baraabar yaa uski samatuly aasti arjeet kar lee gai ho to aastiyon ko aage le jaaya jaataa he
 Cash or cash equivalent liabilities are carried forward, which will be currently required to settle the obligation
 prapya mulya
 aisi aastiyon ko aage badha diya jaataa he jise nakad raashi yaa nakad ke samatuly vyavasthit niptaan main bechakar paaya ja saktaa he
 Liabilities are carried forward to the value of the settlement; Which requires a cash equivalent or cash equivalent payment to pay off liabilities in the normal course of business
 vartmaan mulya
 aastiyon ko bhavishya kii nival rakam ke aagaman ke battagat mulya par aage le jaaya jaataa he jisamen vyapaar kii saamaanya gati main mad ke paidaa hone kii apeksha rahati he
 Liabilities are carried forward to future net cash outflows at the current discounted price, which is required for settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business
 anuchhed 101
 vittiya vivaranon main ikaayiyon dwaara aam taur par sabase adhik apanaaya gaya maapan kaa aadhaar aitihaasik mulya he
 It is usually combined with other measurement bases
 udhaaharan ke liye, maal ko kam laagat par or nival prapya mulya par aage le jaaya jaataa he
 Marketable securities are carried forward to market value and pension liabilities to their present value
 iske atirikt, kuch ikaiyaan gaiyr maudrik aastiyon kii badalati hui keemton ke prabhaav ke kaaran aitihaasik laagat lekha vidhi model ke saath unase niptaan main aksham hai; isliye ve vartmaan laagat ke aadhaar kaa upyog karti hai
 Article 102
 The concept of capital is adopted by most units in their financial statements
 puunji kii vittiya avadharana, jaise ki nivesh kii gai rakam yaa nivesh kii gai kray-shakti ke antargat, nival aasti athwa ikai kii equity ke saath puunji paryaay ban gai he
 Under the objective concept of capital, such as operational efficiency, capital is considered as the productive capacity of the unit, based on the daily output of the units
 anuchhed 103
 kisi ikai ke dwaara puunji kii upyukt avadharana kaa chayan upyogkartaaon ke vittiya vivaranon kii aavashyaktaaon ke aadhaar par hona chahie
 is prakaar, puunji kii vittiya avadharana ko tabhi apanaaya janaa chahie jab upyogkartaaon ke vittiya vivaran praathmik taur par naam maatr kii nivesh kii gai puunji yaa nivesh kii gai puunji kii kray shakti ke rakh rakhaav se sambandhit hon
 phir bhi, agar upyogkartaaon kii mukhya udignata ikai kii sanchaalan kshamta se ho to puunji kii vastuparak avadharana kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 chuni hui avadharana laabh ke nirdhaaran tak pahunchane ke lakshya kii ore ingit karti he, jabaki avadharana ko parichaalit karne main maapan kii kuch kathinaaiyaan paidaa ho sakati hai
 Article 104
 The concept of capital in Article 102 gives rise to the following concepts for the maintenance of capital
 vittiya puunji kaa rakrakhaav
 is avadharana ke antargat laabh tabhi arjeet kiya jaataa he jab avadhi ke aarambh main nival aastiyon kii vittiya raashi maalikon ko kiye gaye vitaranon yaa us avadhi main unase praapt anshdaan ko chhodkar avadhi ke ant main bad jaati he
 The maintenance of financial capital can be measured by either monetary units of volume or units of constant purchasing power
 vastugat puunji kaa rakh-rakhaav is avadharana ke antargat laabh tabhi arjeet hota he jab ikai kii vastugat utpaadan kshamta yaa us kshamta ko paane ke liye avadhi ke ant main sansadhano athwa nidhiyon kii aavashyaktaa maalikon ko kisi prakaar ke vitaran yaa unase praapt anshdaan ko chhodkar us avadhi ke aarambh main vastugat utpaadan kshamta se adhik ho jaati he
 Article 105
 The concept of maintenance of capital is concerned only with how an entity defines capital, which requires its maintenance
 yah puunji kii avadharana or laabh kii avadharanaon ke bich sampark-sutara kaayam karti he kyonki yah us mudde ko sandarbhit karti he jiske dwaara laabh kaa maapan hota he
 It is the first requirement to distinguish between the return on capital of an entity and the return on its capital
 keval aastiyon kii atyadhik raashi main aagaman kii avasthaa main hi puunji ke rakh-rakhaav ko laabh maan liya ja saktaa he or isiilie puunji par pratifal ke rup main samajha jaataa he
 Hence profit is the residual amount that remains after expenses is deducted from income
 agar vyay aay se adhik ho jaataa he to avshisht raashi haani maani jaati he
 Article 106
 The concept of maintenance of commodity capital requires the adoption of measurements based on current costs
 haalanki, vittiya puunji ke rakh-rakhaav kii avadharana ko kisi vishesh maapan ke prayog kii jarurat nahin padati he
 The basis of selection under this concept depends on the type of financial capital to be looked after by the entity
 anuchhed 107
 puunji ke rakh-rakhaav kii do avadharanaon ke bich mukhya antar ikai kii aastiyon or deytaon ke mulyon main parivartanon ke prabhaav kaa upachaar he
 In general terms, an entity maintains its capital if it has as much capital at the end of the period as it was at the beginning of the period
 avadhi ke aarambh main puunji ke rakh-rakhaav ke liye aavashyaktaa se adhik koi bhi raashi laabh he
 Article 108
 Under the concept of maintenance of financial capital in which capital is defined as a nominal monetary unit, profit represents the growth of nominal currency capital over that period
 is prakaar, puri avadhi main aastiyon ke mulyon main vruddhi ko paramparaagat rup se laabh dhaaran karnaa hi mana jaataa rahaa he jo siddhantah laabh hi he
 However, it may not be recognized as such until the assets are settled in the transaction of exchange
 When the concept of maintenance of financial capital is defined as the unit's fixed purchasing power, profit represents an increase in the purchasing power invested over that period
 is prakaar, aastiyon kii keemton main vruddhi kaa vahi ansh jo aam taur par keemton main vruddhi ko paar kar jaataa he, use laabh samajha jaataa he
 The remaining growth is considered as an adjustment to the maintenance of capital, that is, a fraction of equity
 anuchhed 109
 vastugat puunji ke rakh-rakhaav kii avadharana ke antargat jab puunji ko vastugat utpaadak kshamta ke sandarbh main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, tab laabh us avadhi main puunji main vruddhi kaa nirupan karata he
 Changes in all prices that affect the assets and liabilities of a unit are seen as changes in the measurement of the unit's material production capacity; Hence, they are considered as adjustments for maintenance of capital which are part of equity and not profit
 anuchhed 110
 maapan ke aadhaaron kaa chayan or puunji ke rakh-rakhaav kii avadharana vittiya vivaranon kii prastuti main prayukt lekhankan model kaa nirdhaaran karegi
 bhinn lekhankan modells bhinn str kii praasangikta or vishwasaneeyata pradarshit karte hai or, jaisaa ki anya kshetron main, prabandhan ko praasangikta or vishwasaneeyata ke madhya santulan kii talash avashya kerani chahie
 yah ruparekha lekhankan modells kii ek shrunkhlaa main prayojya he or yah chaynit model ke andar taiyaar vittiya vivaranon kii taiyaari or prastuti main maarg-darshan pradaan karata he
 Currently, this IASC board does not aim to set a specific model in addition to the relatively exceptional circumstances, such as for units that report currency as a hypersensitivity economy
 haalanki, vishwavyaapee vikaason ke alok main is uddeshy kii samiksha kii jaaegi
 IFRS financial statements include purv samikshadhin avadhi ke liye tulanaatmak soochna pradaan kii gai he
 An entity preparing an IFRS account for the first time will have to fully implement IFRS for the current and comparative period, although it has a transitional exemption

 The SEC received over 220 review papers from diverse group constituents on its timetable
 Some of the key points that were in the paper: - Only one set of standards for high quality financial reporting should be used globally
 That should be the end goal - Continuing support for most reactionaries throughout the continuation of the convergence process - Accounting based on user principles The framework is more preferred with strong practical judgment as well as economic output in the transaction
 Ray should include clear and transparent disclosure, so that conclusions are reached and transactions related accounting
 - Acknowledgment that the expected cost to adopt IFRS would be meaningful but not the anticipated cost of adoption higher for the United States capital market Will be important
 - a clear commitment and adoption date are required, this 2014, meri shapiro, SEC kii adhyaksh, ne 6 july 2009 ko antarrashtriya lekhankan maanak samiti foundation kii ek baithak ke dauraan SEC kii prastaavit yojana par ek adhyatan ruparekha pradaan kii he

 The world-wide knowledge of its existence was brought by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1814, and subsequently the British ruler of Java carried on the task
 borobudur ko uske baad kai baar marammat karke sangrakshit rakhaa gaya
 Most of its repairs were carried out by the Government of Indonesia and UNESCO between 1975 and 1982 after UNESCO listed it as a World Heritage Site

 Borobudur is the most visited tourist destination in Indonesia
 indonesia main pracheen mandiron ko chandi ke naam se pukaara jaataa he atah "borobudur mandir" ko kai baar chandi borobudur bhi kaha jaataa he
 The word chandi is also loosely used for compositions related to ancient textures such as gates and baths
 yadhyapi borobudur shabd kaa mul aspasht he tathaa indonesia ke pramukh pracheen mandir gyaat nahin hai
 The term Borobudur was first used in the history of Java by Sir Thomas Raffles
 raddles ne borobudur naamak ek smarak ke bare main likhaa lekin is naam kaa isse purana koi dastauez uplabdh nahin he
 Only the ancient Java tabloids indicate that the name of the monument is called the Budur holy Buddhist shrine Nagarkaratagama
 yah taalptr majaapahit rajdrabari evam buddha vidwaan mapu prapancha dwaara san 1365 main likhaa gaya tha
 Borobudur, according to some opinions, is an abrasive form of the name boré-budur, which Raffles wrote in English grammar meaning "" the temple of Budur, adjacent to the village of Boré "; Most of the chandis are named after the nearby villages
 yadi ise java bhashaa ke anuroop samajha jaye to smarak kaa naam "buduraboro" hona chahie / raddles ne yah bhi suzav diya ki budur sambhavtah aadhunik java bhashaa ke shabd buddha se bana he ― "pracheen boro"
 However, according to other archaeologists, the second component of the name is derived from the Javanese word bhudhara
 anya sambhavit shabd-vyutpatiyon ke anusaar borobudur sanskrit shabd vihaar buddha uhar ke likhe huye rup biyara beduhur kaa sthaneey java sarlikrut apbhrasht uccharan he
 The word buddha-uhr can mean "city of Buddha" while the other possible word Beduhur is the ancient Java language present in Aaj Tak Bali vocabulary meaning a "high place" which is derived from the pillar word dhuhur or luhur
 
 iske anusaar borobudur kaa arth ucch sthaan athwa pahari ilaake main buddha ke vihaar se he
 The construction and inauguration of a religious Buddhist building — possibly in relation to Borobudur — is mentioned in two inscriptions
 donon kedu, tamanggang regency main mili
 According to the Kayumavungan inscription dated from 824, Pramodavardhini, the daughter of Samaratung, inaugurated the religious building called Jinalaya

 Kamulan is in the form of the word mula, which means "place of origin", a religious site in memory of ancestors, possibly related to the Shailendra dynasty
 casaparis ke anusaar borobudur kaa mul naam bhoomi sambhaar bhudhaar he jo ek sanskrit shabd he or iskaa arth "bodhisattva ke das charnon ke sanyukt gunon kaa pahaad" he
 Borobudur is located about 40 kilometers from Yogyakarta, and 86 kilometers from Surakar
 yah do judawaan jwalamukhiyon, sundoro-sumbing or merbabu-meraapi evam do nadiyon progo or elo ke bich ek ooncha kshetra par sthit he
 According to local myth, this area known as Kedu Maidan is one of the "sacred" sites of Java and due to the high agricultural fertility of the region, it is also called "the Garden of Java" i

 20veen sadi main marammat kaary ke dauraan yah paaya gaya ki is kshetra ke tino buddha mandir, borobudur, paavon or mendut, ek sidhi rekha main sthit hai
 It is believed that the three temples were associated with a ritual process, although what the process was is unknown
 borobudur kaa nirmaan samudr tal se 265 me kii oonchai par ek chattan par, ek sookhe jhil kii sataha se 15 me upar kiya gaya tha
 The issue of the existence of this ancient lake was the subject of intense discussion among archaeologists in the 20th century
 1931 main, ek dach kalakaar evam hindu or buddha vaastukala vidwaan, dablyoo o je niuvencamp dwaara viksit siddhant ke anusaar kedu plane pracheen kaal main ek jhil hua karata tha or borobudur shuru main isi jhil par tairte ek camel ke phool kii abhivednaa thi
 There is no written record that explains the creator of Borobudur or its purpose
 iske nirmaan kaa samay mandir main utkirnit ucchaavchon or 8veen tathaa 9veen sadi ke dauraan shahi paatro saamaanya rup se prayukt abhilekhon kii tulana se prakallit kiya jaataa he
 Borobudur was probably founded around 800 CE

 At this time it was under the influence of Srivijaya dynasty
 iske nirmaan kaa anumaanit samay 75 varsh he or nirmaan kaary san 825 ke lagbhag samartung ke kaarykaal main purna hua
 There is confusion in the time of Hindu and Buddhist rulers in Java
 shailendra rajvansh ko buddha dharm ke kattar anuyaayi mana jaataa he yadhyapi sojomerto main praapt pathar shilalekhon ke anusaar wo hindu the
 This was the time when various Hindu and Buddhist monuments were constructed in the plains and hilly areas near the Kedu plains
 borobudur sahit buddha smarakon kii sthapana lagbhag usee samay hui jab hindu shiv prambnan mandir kaa nirmaan hua
 In 720 CE, the Shaiva king Sanjay started the Shivalinga shrine on the Vukir hill, only 10 km east of Borobudur
 borobudur sahit buddha mandir kaa nirmaan us samay sambhav tha kyonki sanjay ke uttaradhikari rakaai picktan ne buddha anuyaayiyon ko is tarah ke mandiron ke nirmaan kii anumati pradaan kar di thi
 In fact, Piketan gave a village called Kalsan to the Buddhist community to show their respect to him, as written in the Kalsan Gazette dated from 778 CE
 jis tarah hindi raja ne buddha smarakon kii sthapana main sahaayta karnaa athwa ek buddha raja dwaara aisa hi karnaa, jaise vichaaron se prerit kuch puratatvavidon kaa mat he ki java main kabhi bhi bada dharmik takaraav nahin tha
 However, it is such that there were two opposing dynasties at the same time — the Buddhist Shailendra dynasty and the Shaiva Sanjaya — which later led to a war on Ratu Boko Mahalaya in 856 AD
 bhram kii sthiti prambnan parisar ke lara jonggrang mandir ke bare main maujuud he jo sanjay rajvansh ke borobudur ke pratyuttar main shailendra rajvansh ke vijeta rakaai piktaan ne sthapit karavaaya
 But according to other opinions, there was an atmosphere of peaceful co-existence where the Shailendra dynasty participated in Lara Jonggarang
 borobudur ko kai sadiyon tak jwalamukheey raakh or jangal vikaas ne chupaaye rakhaa
 The reasons behind its abandonment are also mysterious
 yah gyaat nahin he ki smarak kaa upyog or tirthayatriyon ke liye ise kab band kiya gaya tha
 Between 928 and 1006, due to the series of volcanic eruptions, King Mpu Sindok shifted the capital of the Mataram dynasty to East Java; It is not certain whether it affected abandonment but according to various sources, it was the most suitable time for abandonment
 smarak kaa aspasht ullekh madhyakaal main 1365 ke lagbhag mapu prapancha kii pustak nagarkaretagma main miltaa he jo majaapahit kaal main likhi gai tathaa isamen "budur main vihaar" kaa ullekh he
 Soekmono also mentions the proverbial doctrine according to which in the 15th century when the people started converting to Islam, the temple started to be destroyed
 smarak ko purnataya nahin bhulaaya ja sakaa, kyonki lok kathayen iske mahimapurna itihaas se asafalataa or durgati ke saath andhvishwaason se jud gayi
 Two ancient Javanese accounts of the 18th century mention the story of the failures associated with the monument
 babad tanah jaavi ke anusaar 1709 main mataram samrajya ke raja pakubuvono pratham ke prati vidroh karnaa maas daana ke liye ghaatak kaarak siddh hua
 It mentions that the "ready Borobudur" hill was besieged and the rebels defeated in it and the king sentenced them to death
 babad mataram main, smarak ko san 1757 main yogyakarta sultanate ke yuvaraj raja monchonagoro ke durbhaagya se joda gaya he
 According to it, "he carried a perforated stupa" despite the prohibition of entry into the memorial

 It was under British administration from 1811 to 1816 after Jav was authorized

 During an inspection round in Semarang in 1814, he came to know about a large monument deep inside a forest near the village of Bumisegoro
 wo isaki khoj karne main swayan asamarth the atah unhone dach abhiyantaa echsi cornelius ko anveshan ke liye bheja
 Two months later Cornelius and 200 of his men cut down trees, burned down the grass and dug out the ground and took out the monument
 smarak ke dhahane ke khatre ko dekhte huye wo sabhi vithikaaon kaa pataa lagane main asamarth rahe
 Although the discovery is only mentioned in a few sentences, Raffles is credited with the revival of the monument as he was one of the first to place the monument to the world
 kedu kshetra ke dach prashaasak hartman ne cornelius ke kaary ko lagaataa aage badhaayaa or 1835 main puure parisar ko bhoomi se baahar nikaala
 He had more personal interest in Borobudur than official
 unhone is bare main koi lekhan kaary nahin kiya
 Especially according to the alleged stories he discovered a large statue of Buddha in the main stupa
 san 1842 main hartman ne mukhya gumbad kaa anveshan kiya, haalanki unke dwaara khoja gaya kaary agyaat he or mukhya stupa khaali he
 The Dutch East Indies government commissioned a Dutch official engineer, FC Wilson
 unhone smarak kaa adhyayan kiya or ucchaavchon ke saikadon rekha-chitra banaaye
 JFG Brumund was also appointed to study the monument and completed his work in 1859
 sarkaar ne wilson ke rekhachitron ko saath jodakar brumund ke kaary par aadhaarit lekh prakashit karnaa chaahati thi lekin brumund ne sahyog nahin kiya
 The government later assigned this task to another researcher, C
 Leamans
 unhone wilson ke sroton or brumund ke kaary par aadhaarit viniabandh sankalit kiye
 The monolithic study of Borobudur's study was published in English in 1873, and a year later it was also published in French

 As a result, the government appointed Archaeologist Groenveldt to explore the site and find out the actual location of the complex; In his report he found that such fears are unreasonable and favored keeping it in the same position
 borobudur smriti chihnon ke strot ke rup main janaa jane laga or isaki murtiyon ke bhaagon ko lut liya gaya
 Some of these parts were also looted with the consent of the colonial government

 In 1990, the government set up a commission of three officials for the use of the monument
 inamen kala itihaaskaar brandes, dach sena ke abhiyantaa adhikari theodor vine arp or lok nirmaan vibhaag ke nirmaan abhiyantaa vine di qamar shaamil the
 In 1902, the Commission presented to the government a plan with three proposals
 isamen pehle prastaav main konon ko punah sthapit karne, thik se nahin lage pattharon ko hataanaa, vedikaon kaa sudrudhikaran or jharokhe, mahiraab, stupa or mukhya gumbad ko punah sthapit karnaa shaamil tha jisase tatkaal ho sakane vaale durghatnaon ko roka ja sake
 The second proposal included removing the cell, providing proper maintenance, repairing the floors and stupas and improving drainage
 us samay is kaary kii kul anumaanit laagat lagbhag 48,800 dach gilder thi
 Thereafter repairs were carried out between 1907 and 1911 according to the rules of Theodore van Erp and the Department of Archeology
 isaki marammat ke pratham saat maah tak buddha kii murtiyon ke sir or stambhon ke pathar khojane ke liye smarak ke aasapaas khudaai main lag gayi

 At first glance Borobudur became established with its old glory
 vine arp ne saavdhaneepurvak mukhya stupa ke shikhar par chhatra punarnirmaan kaa kaary armbh karavaaya
 However, he later removed the canopy as the original stones were not available in sufficient quantity in the construction of the summit

 The removed parasol is now kept in the Karmavibhangaga museum located a few hundred meters north of Borobudur

 vine arp ne concrit kaam main liya tha jisase kshareey lavan tathaa calcium hydroxide kaa ghol baahar aane laga jiskaa apvaahan baaki nirmaan main bhi hone aga
 Due to this some problems started coming up and there was an urgent need for its complete renovation
 tatkaal kuch laghu marammat kaa kaary kiya gaya lekin wo purna suraksha ke liye paryaapt nahin tha
 During World War II and the Indonesian National Revolution from 1945 to 1949, Borobudur's restoration efforts had to be halted

 The restoration also included the work of improving the drainage in the memorial by removing five square platforms

 Statues of Buddha are installed inside these perforated classmates
 borobudur kaa swaroop sopan-pyramid se lee gayi he
 Earlier in Indonesia, prehistoric Austronesian megalithic culture found various ground fortifications and stone step-pyramid structures called Punden Berundak which were discovered in Pangguyangan, Kisolok and Gunung Padung, West Java
 pathar se bane pyramidon ke nirmaan nirmaan ke pichhe sthaneey vishwaas yah he ki parvaton or unche sthanon par paitruk atmaaon athwa hyang kaa nivas hota he
 The basic design of Punden Berundak sopan-pyramid Borobudur is considered to be an extension of the stone tradition incorporated with Mahayana Buddhist ideas and symbols
 smarak ke teen bhaag pratikatmak rup se teen lokon ko nirupit karte hai
 These three worlds are Kamadhatu, Rupadhatu and Arupadhatu respectively
 saadhaaran baudhgamya apana jivan inamen se nimnatar jivan str ichchhaaon kii duniya main rahata he
 Those who overcome their desires rise above the first level and reach the place from where they can see the forms but they do not have the desire
 ant main purna buddha vyavhaarik vaastaviktaa ke jeevanaster se upar uth jate hai or yah sabase moolbhoot tathaa vishuddh str mana jaataa he
 In this, those formless nirvana are attained
 sansar ke jivan chakra se upari rup jahaan prabud aatma shoonyata ke samaan, sansaarik rup ke saath sanlagn nahin hoti, use purna khalipan athwa apane aap astitvaheen rakhana aata he
 Kamadhatu is represented from the base, Rupadhatu is represented by five square storeys and Arupadhatu is represented by three circular storeys and the huge Shikhara Stupa
 in teen staron ke sthapaty gunon main lakshanik antar hai
 For example, the square and elaborate ornamentation found in the Rupadhatu disappears into the simple circular floor of the Arupadhatu, representing a world of forms — where people are connected by name and form — transformed into a formless world
 borobudur main samuhik puja ghoomte huye tirth ke rup main kii jaati he

 The "hidden Foot" also contains reliefs, 160 of which explain the description of the real Kamadhatu
 iske alaava bachche huye ucchavach shilalekhith choukhat hai jisamen murtikar ne nakkashiyon ke bare main kuch aavashyak anudesh likhe the
 There is a fringed base above the actual base, whose purpose remains a mystery even today
 praarambhik vichaaron ke anusaar pahari main vinaashkari ghataav aane kii sthiti main vaastavik aadhaar ko aachhadit karne ke liye hai
 According to other opinions, the reason for making the fringed base is due to texture defects in the original base hidden according to Vastu Shastra, the ancient Indian book about city planning and architecture
 iske baavjood chunki iskaa nirmaan kaary armbh ho chukaa tha atah jhaalardaar aadhaar kaa nirmaan purna saundarya or dharmik vichaaron kaa sukshmata se dhyaan rakhkar kiya gaya
 Apart from the story of Buddhist Brahmadiki being stone-fired, Borobudur also has various statues of Buddha
 isamen pair par pair rakhkar padmasana sthiti vaali murtiyan paanch vargakar chabutaron par ke saath-saath upari chabutare maujuud hai
 At the Rupadhatu level, the statues of Buddha in Deoli are arranged in rows outside the pillar setting in which the number of idols at the upper level is continuously reduced
 pratham vedika main 104 devli, duusari main 88, teesri main 72, chauthi main 72 or paanchavi main 64 devli hai
 Altogether there are 432 Buddha statues up to the Rupadhatu level
 arupadhatu str par buddha kii murtiyan stupon ke andar sthit hai
 It has 32 stupas on the first circular platform, 24 on the second and 16 stupas on the third with a total of 72 stupas
 mul 504 buddha murtiyon main se 300 se adhik kshatigrastha ho chuki hai or 43 murtiyan gum hai
 Till the discovery of the monument, the heads of the idols were stolen by Western collectors as an object of collection
 borobudur se buddha kii murtiyon ke in shirshamukhon main se kuch ab amsterdam ke tropen museum or landan ke british sangrahalay sahit vibhinn sangraahalayon main dekhe ja sakate hai
 At first glance all the statues of Buddha appear to be identical but there is a slight difference in the position or position of the hands of all those idols
 inamen mudra ke paanch samooh hai: uttar, purv, dakshin, pashchim or shirobindu
 All these strings represent the five sequential compasses according to Mahayana
 pratham chaar vedikaon main pehali chaar mudraayen main prayek murti compass kii ek disha ko nirupit karata he
 The statue of Buddha in the fifth Vedika and the 72 stupas of the upper platform are in the same pose
 prayek mudra main 'paanch dhyani buddha' main se kisi ek ko nirupit karti he jinamein prayek kaa apana pratikwaad he
 According to pradakshina or clockwise circumambulation, the position of Buddha's idols in Borobudur, starting from the east, is as follows: borobudur main jahaaj ke ucchavach prapatt

 udhyam sansaadhan yojana ek company-vyapee computer software pranali he jiskaa upyog saajha data bhandaron dwaara sabhi sansadhano, soochna or vyapaar sambandhi prakaaryon ke samanvay or prabandhan hetu hota he
 An ERP system has a service-oriented architecture consisting of modular hardware and software units and "services" that communicate over a local area network

 ERP pranaliyaan ab udhyam ke sabhi pramukh kaaryon ko samahit karne kaa prayaas karti hai, sanghathan kaa vyavsaay yaa ghoshnaptr chaahe kuch bhi ho
 These systems can now be found in non-production businesses, non-profit organizations, and governments
 ERP pranali kahalaane ke liye, ek software package ko kam se kam do pranaaliyon ke prakaarya pradaan karne chahie
 For example, a software package that provides both salary and accounting functions may technically be called an ERP software package
 ek ERP main anukhandon ke udaahranon main, jo pehle swatantra aplicoshan hua karte the, shaamil hai: utpaada jivan-chakra prabandhan, aapurti shrinkhalaa prabandhan, godaam prabandhan, graahak sambandh prabandhan, bikri aadesh prasanskaran, online bikri, vittiya, maanav sansaadhan or nirnay samarthan pranali
 Some organizations — typically those with sufficient internal IT capabilities to integrate software products — choose to implement only parts of an ERP system and develop external interfaces to ERP or independent systems for their other application requirements
 Huh
 udhaaharan ke liye, ve kisi ek vikreta kii maanav sansaadhan prabandhan pranali kaa upyog karne kaa chayan kar sakate hai or pranaaliyon ke darmyaan ekikaran ko swayan kar sakate hai
 This is common for retailers, where a medium-sized retailer will also have a discrete point of sale product and financial applications and then a range of specific applications for warehouse management, employee inventory, merchandising and logistics
 
 adarsh rup main, ERP ek ekal databes pradaan karata he jisamen software anukhandon ke liye sabhi data maujuud rahete hai, jinamein shaamil hai: Data warehousing for customers, suppliers and employees and various self-service interface access control - user privilege customization based on authority levels for process execution - to meet expansion, addition and change in process flow udhyam sansaadhan yojana shabd mul rup se manuphaccharing risource planning se liya gaya he, jo ki material riquirement planning se aayaa he
 MRP transitioned to ERP when "routings" became a major part of the software architecture, and a company's capacity planning activity also became a part of standard software activities
 ERP pranaliyaan aamtaur par company ke nirmaan, loujistics, vitaran, maal, nauvahan, chaalaan or lekha kaa prabandhan karti hai
 ERP software can assist in the control of many business activities such as sales, marketing, distribution, billing, production, goods management, quality management and human resource management
 companiyon dwaara apni puraani pranaaliyon main Y2K samasya kaa saamana karne ke kaaran 1990 ke dashak main ERP pranaaliyon kii bikri main baari vruddhi dekhne ko mili
 Many companies took advantage of this opportunity to replace their outdated information systems with ERP systems
 bikri kii is teji main 1999 main mandi aa gayi, kyonki is samay tak adhikansh companiyaan apane Y2K samaadhaan lagu kar chuki thim
 ERP is often incorrectly considered a back office system, indicating that customers and the general public have no direct concern with it
 isaki tulana front offis pranaaliyon ke saath kii jaati he, jaise ki graahak sambandh prabandhan pranaliyaan jo sidhe graahakon se judati hai, yaa i-bijness pranaliyaan jaise ki i-kamrs, i-government, i-telecom or i-finance, yaa aapurtikarta sambandh prabandhan pranaliyaan
 ERP can be used throughout the enterprise and any of its functions

 Apart from manufacturing, storage, logistics and information technology, it will also include accounting, human resources, marketing and strategic management

 EAS - Enterprise Application Suite, is the new name for previously developed ERP systems that cover all parts of the business and use common Internet browsers
 adhikansh ERP vikritaon ke software package main sarvshereshth pranaaliyon kaa samaayojan rahata he
 When implementing an ERP system, organizations can choose between customizing the software, or modifying their business processes to conform to the "best practices" in the software
 ERP se pehle software kaa vikaas vyapaarik prakriyaaon ke anusaar hota tha
 Due to the complexity of most ERP systems and the negative consequences of failure in ERP implementation, most vendors have incorporated "best practices" into their software
 vikreta ke anusaar ye "sarvottam prathaen" ek ekikrut udhyam-vyapee pranali main kisi vishisht vyapaarik prakriya ke liye sabase kargar tarika hoti hai
 a study by the Lugwigshafen University of Applied Science surveyed 192 companies and concluded that companies that have implemented industry best practices have declined in important project tasks such as configuration, documentation, testing and training
 iske alaava, sarvottam prathaon ke upyog se anya softwaron kii tulana main jokhim main 71% se adhik kii kami aayi
 The use of best practices makes compliance with requirements such as IFRS, sarbanes-oxley or Basel II easier
 ve vahaan bhi madad kar sakati hai jahaan prakriya electronic dhan hastantaran jaisi ek vastu ho
 This is because the process of capturing and reporting legislative and commodity content can be easily coded within ERP software and then replicated with confidence across businesses that have similar business requirements
 vyavsaayon kii sabhi kaaryaatmak ikaayiyon main aplications or prakriyaaon kii vyapak gunjaaish hoti he; ERP software pranaaliyon kaa utpaadan kiya jaataa he jo aam taur par jatil hoti hai or karmchaariyon kii kaary paddatiyon main mahatvapurn badlaavon kii maang karti hai
 The implementation of ERP software is typically too complex for "internal" skills, so it is desirable and advisable to seek the help of professionally trained external consultants to implement these systems
 This is usually the most effective way to reduce costs
 teen prakaar kii sevaayen hai jinke liye niyukti kii ja sakati he - paraamarsh, anukulan or sahaayta
 ek ERP pranali ko lagu karne kii avadhi vyapaar ke aakaar, anukhandon kii sankhya, anukulan kii seemaa, parivartan kii gunjaaish or pariyojna kaa swaamitv grahan ke liye graahak kii ichha, par nirbhar karti he
 ERP systems are modulated, so it is not necessary to implement them all at once
 These can be divided into different levels or stages
 ek aam pariyojna main lagbhag 14 maheene or 150 ke aasapaas salaahkaaron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 a small project can be planned and implemented within 3-9 months; Whereas, a large, multi-sectoral and multi-country implementation may take years
 karyanvayan kii avadhi bahut kuch anukulan kii vaanchit maatra par nirbhar karti he
 Companies often seek the assistance of ERP vendors or third-party consulting companies to implement ERP systems
 ye companiyaan aamtaur par teen kshetron kii peshewar sevaayen pradaan karti hai: paraamarsh, anukulan or sahaayta
 graahak sanghathan, swatantra kaarykram prabandhan, vyapaar vishleshan, parivartan prabandhan or UAT visheshgyon ko niyukt kar sakate hai, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki karyanvayan ke dauraan unki vyavsaayik aavashyaktaaon kii praathamikta bani rahe
 Data transfer is one of the most important activities in determining the success of an ERP implementation
 chunki sthanantaran se pehle kai mahatvapurn nirnay liye jate hai, ati yojanabaddh tareeke se aage badhanaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Unfortunately, data migration is the last activity before the production phase of an ERP implementation, so it is given little attention due to time constraints
 ek ERP karyanvayan kii safalataa ke liye data pravaas ranneetiyon ke nimnlikhit kadam sahaayak siddh ho sakati hai: ERP vendors have designed their systems according to standard business processes, based on best business practices
 Processes of different vendors are of different types but they all follow a standard, modular nature
 parinamswaroop, jo companiyaan ERP pranaaliyon ko lagu karnaa chaahati hai unhen apni maujuuda prakriyaaon ke anusaar ERP package ko dhaalane kii bajaay apane sanghathanon ko maanak prakriyaaon ke anusaar dhaalane ke liye baadhya hona padataa he
 Neglecting to map current business processes before starting ERP implementation is one of the main reasons for the failure of ERP projects
 yah isliye mahatvapurn he ki sanghathan ek ERP vikreta ke chayan or iske kriyanvayan se pehle vyavsaayik prakriyaaon kaa sampoorn vishleshan karen
 This analysis should map all the existing business processes, so that an ERP vendor whose standard modules are most closely associated with the established organization is selected
 Redesign can then be implemented to achieve greater procedural integration
 shodh yah ingit karata he ki vyavsaayik prakriyaaon main bemail ke jokhim ko nimnlikhit ke dwaara kam kiya ja saktaa he: ERP implementation is more difficult in organizations where there are almost independent business units, each unit being responsible for its own losses, as they each have separate processes, business rules, data semantics, authority hierarchies and decision centers
 Occur
 samaadhaanon main shaamil hai, sthaneey parivartan prabandhan peshewaron dwaara aavashyaktaaon kaa samanvay yaa, yadi yah sambhav na ho, shithil ekikrut udaahranon kaa upyog karte hue sanghabaddh karyanvayan jinhen sthaneey aavashyaktaaon kii purti hetu vishesh taur par vinyast or / yaa anukool banaaya gaya ho
 One disadvantage of ERP is commonly reported that the transformation of business processes to match standardized ERP modules can lead to a decrease in competitive superiority
 pralekhith sakshya maujuud he jahaan vastav main aisa hua, jabaki anya maamle darshaate hai ki ERP prakriyaaon kaa purnataa se anusaran sthai pratispardhaatmak shreshthata ko vastav main badha saktaa he
 Configuring an ERP system is basically just balancing between what you want the system to do and how the system allows you to work
 shuruyaat is baat se karen ki kin anukhandon ko sthapit karnaa he, tatpashchaat apni company kii prakriyaaon ke saath sarvshereshth sambhav samaayojan hetu, vinyas talikaon ke upyog se pranali ko samanvit karen
 Modules - Most systems are modulated only so that some functions can be implemented, but others are not
 vitt or lekha jaise kuch saamaanya anukhand lagbhag sabhi companiyon dwaara apanaae jate hai; jabaki maanav sansaadhan prabandhan jaise anya anukhandon kii aavashyaktaa companiyon ko nahin hoti, isliye unhen nahin apanaaya jaataa he
 For example, a service provider might not need a construction module
 Many times companies do not adopt any module because they have their own system which is better for them
 saamanytah, jitne adhik anukhandon kaa chayan kiya jaayegaa, ekikaran laabh main utani hi vruddhi hogi, lekin saath hi laagat, jokhim or sambandhit parivartanon main bhi vruddhi aayegi
 Configuration Tables - a configuration table enables a company to customize a specific aspect of the system according to the way its business is selected
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek sanghathan maal-suchi lekhankan ke prakaar kaa- fifo yaa lifo- chayan kar saktaa he, yaa vah rajasav kii pahchaan kiske dwaara karnaa chahat he- bhugolic ikai, utpaada, yaa vitaran channel
 tab kya hota he jab pranali dwaara pradipt vikalp samuchit na hon? aise main company ke paas do vikalp hai, lekin donon hi adarsh nahin hai
 That enterprise system can rewrite the codes, or continue to use the existing system and create interfaces between it and the new enterprise system
 donon vikalp karyanvayan prakriya kii laagat or samay ko badhaayenge
 iske alaava ve is pranali ke ekikaran laabh ke mahatv ko bhi kam kar sakate hai
 The greater the amount of system optimization, the lower the ease of communication between suppliers and customers
 kai sanghathanon ke paas ERP pariyojna ko lagu karne ke liye paryaapt aantarik kaushal nahin tha
 As a result, many organizations started providing consulting services for ERP implementation
 aamtaur par, ek paraamarsh team puure ERP karyanvayan ke liye jimmedaar thi, jisamen shaamil tha yojana, prashikshan, pareekshan, karyanvayan or anukulit anukhandon kii delivery
 anukulan ke udaahranon main shaamil hai, atirikt utpaada prashikshan; prakriya pravartak or karypravah kaa nirmaan; ERP kaa vyapaar main kis prakaar upyog kiya jaye, isamen sudhaar hetu visheshgy salaah; pranali anukulan; or sahaayta lekhan reportein, jatil data nishkarshon yaa vyapaar khufia karyanvayan
 Implementation costs for most mid-sized companies can range from twice the written price of an ERP user license
 Larger companies, especially multi-sectoral or multi-country companies, often spend significantly more than the cost of user licenses for implementation — spending up to three to five times is not uncommon for multi-sectoral implementations
 adhikansh ekal-uddeshy aplications ke vipareet, ERP packages main shuruyaat se hi purna strot code shaamil rahaa he or anurupan tathaa pradipt code ke vistaar ke liye vikreta samarthit team ides ke saath inako bheja jaataa rahaa he
 During the early years of ERP, when a potential client was considering internally developing its own unique solution, or gathering function-wide solutions by integrating multiple applications of the "best-of-breed", At the time, support for mature equipment guarantees and extensive customization was an important sales rationale
 packing ke dibbe se baahar nikalate hi kor pranali kaise kaam karti he, graahakon dwaara usko parvartit karne kii aavashyaktaa kii purti hetu ERP vikritaon ne pehle se hi maujuud "vinyas" suvidhaayen pradaan karke anurupan kii aavashyaktaaon ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 The main differences between customization and configuration include: is vishleshan ke anusaar, ek ERP package kaa anurupan apratyaashit rup se mahangaa or jatil ho saktaa he, tathaa ek ekikaran pranali ke spasht laabhon kii prapti main deree kar saktaa he
 However, simulating an ERP suite provides scope for applying secret technologies to excellence in specific areas, as well as ensuring that industry best practices are implemented in less sensitive areas
 is sandarbh main "vistaar" un tareekon ko darshata he jinke dwaara pradipt ERP vaataavaran ko tritiy-paksh kaaryakramon dwaara badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 It is technically easier to open most ERP exchanges to external programs, for example, xxrep 4 
 chunki ERP aplications main aamtaur par jatil niyam shaamil hote hai jo master data ke nirmaan or parivartan ko niyantrit karte hai, kuch paridrishyon kaa karyanvayan bahut mushkil ho jaataa he
 Maintenance and ancillary services include, monitoring and managing an operational ERP system
 This function is usually provided internally with the help of members of the IT department, or may also be provided by an external specialist consulting and services company
 ek ERP pranali kii anupasthiti main, ek bade nirmaataa ke paas kai software aplications ho sakate hai jo ek duusare se prabhavi rup se samvaad yaa interphes sthapit karne main asamarth hon
 ek duusare ke saath interphes sthapit karne vaale kaaryon main shaamil hai: The ERP system centers the data in one place
 iske laabhon main shaamil hai: Some security features are incorporated into an ERP system to provide protection against external crime such as industrial espionage and internal crime such as embezzlement
 udhaaharan ke liye data se ched-chhaad kaa ek paridrishy yah ho saktaa he, ek asantusht karmchaaree jaanboojhkar keemton ko unke nimnatam str ke neeche rakh rahaa ho taaki company ke munaafe se ched-chhaad kii ja sake yaa anya kisi prakaar se nuksaan pahunchaaya ja sake
 ERP systems generally facilitate internal control against such acts
 ERP vikreta anya prakaar ke soochna suraksha upkarnon ke saath behatar ekikaran kii ore bad rahe hai
 The problems with ERP systems are primarily due to insufficient investment in the training of the IT personnel involved - including those who implement and test the changes - as well as the lack of corporate policy towards protecting data integrity and how they are used
