 The legend of Nal and Damayanti appears in the epic of India, the Mahabharata
 yudhisthir ko jue main apana sab-kuch ganvaa kar apane bhaaiyon ke saath vanvaas karnaa padaa
 At the same time, a sage told him the story of Nal and Damayanti
 nal nishadh desh ke raja the
 He was the son of Veersen
 nal bade vir the or sundar bhi
 He was proficient in armaments and horse-handling
 damyanti vidarbha naresh kii ekmaatr putree thi
 She was also very beautiful and talented
 nal uske saundarya kii prashansa sunakar usase prem karne laga
 The message of their love was delivered to Damayanti very efficiently by a swan
 or damyanti bhi apane us anjaan premi kii virah main jalane lagi
 This story has such an effective put of love and suffering that writers and poets, not only from India but also from abroad, could not live without being attracted by it
 bop latin main tathaa dean millman ne angreji kavita main anuwaad karke pashchim ko bhi is katha se bhalee bhaanti parichit karaayaa he
 a king named Bhishmak ruled the country of Vidarbha
 unki putree kaa naam damyanti thi
 Damayanti was as beautiful as Lakshmi
 unheen dinon nishadh desh main virasen ke putr nal rajya karte the
 He was very talented, truthful and a Brahmin devotee
 nishadh desh se jo log vidarbha desh main aate the, ve maharaj nal ke gunon kii prashansa karte the
 This praise also reached Damayanti's ears
 isi tarah vidarbha desh se aane vaale log rajkumaari ke rup or gunon kii charchaa maharaj nal ke samakshkarte
 As a result of this, Nal and Damayanti became attracted towards each other
 mahabharat main dharmraj yudhisthir ke aagrah karne par maharishi brihadshv ne nal-damyanti kii katha sunai- Dharmaraja! In the country of Nishad, there has been a king named Nal, son of Veersen
 ve bade gunavan, param sundar, satyawadee, jitendriya, sabake priy, vedagy evam brahmanbhakt the
 His army was very large
 
 He himself was very proficient in astrology
 ve vir, yoddha, udaar or prabal parakramee bhi the
 He also had some passion for playing gambling
 unheen dinon vidarbha desh main bhim naam ke ek raja rajya karte the
 He was also very virtuous and mighty like Nal
 unhone daman rishi ko prasann karke unke vardaan se chaar santaanen praapt kii thim—teen putr or ek kanya
 The names of the sons were Dum, Dant, and Daman
 putree kaa naam tha—damyanti
 Damayanti was as beautiful as Lakshmi
 uske netra vishaal the
 Even the beautiful girl was not seen in the gods and yakshas
 un dinon kitne hi log vidarbha desh se nishadh desh main aate or raja nal ke saamne damyanti ke rup or gun kaa bakhaan karte
 Even those who went from Nishad country to Vidarbha used to describe the form, quality and sacred character of King Nal in front of Damayanti
 is prakaar donon ke hriday main parsparik anuraag ankurit ho gaya
 One day King Nal saw some swans in the garden of his palace
 unhone ek hans ko pakad liya
 Hans said - 'if you leave me, we will go to Damayanti and describe your qualities in such a way that she will definitely take you
 ’ nal ne hansako chhod diya
 They were flown in unfertile country
 damyanti apane hanson ko dekhakar bahut prasann hui or hanson ko pakadaney ke liye unki ore daudane lagi
 The swan that Damayanti ran to catch, he would say, 'ari Damayanti! Nishad is a king named Nal in the country
 vah ashvinikumar ke samaan sundar he
 No one else is as beautiful as human beings
 vah maano murtiman kaamdev he
 If you become his wife, then both your birth and appearance become successful
 ham logon ne devtaa, gandharva, manushya, sarp or rakshason ko gum-ghumkar dekha he nal ke samaan kahin sundar purush dekhne main nahin aayaa
 Just as you are a gem in women, in the same way Nal is a Bhushan in men
 tum donon kii jodi bahut hi sundar hogi
 Damayanti said - "hansa! Say the same thing to you from the tap
 ’ hans ne nishadh desh main lautakar nal se damyanti kaa sandesh kah diya
 On hearing the fame of King Nal from the mouth of Damayanti Hans, he started loving them
 uski aasakti itani bad gayi ki vah raat-din unka hi dhyaan karti rahati
 The body became foggy and lean
 vah deen-si deekhne lagi
 The Sakhis, following Damayanti's heart rate, requested Vidarbharaj that 'your daughter is unwell
 ’ raja bhim ne apni putree ke sambandh main bada vichaar kiya
 In the end, he reached the decision that my daughter had become married, so she should do it herself
 unhone sab raajaaon ko swayamvar kaa nimantran-patr bhej diya or suchit kar diya ki raajaaon ko damyanti ke swayamvar main padharkar laabh uthaanaa chaiye or meraa manorath purna karnaa chaiye
 The patriarchs of the country, with the sound of elephants, horses and chariots, started reaching the Vidarbha country with vigor while scorching the earth
 bhim ne sabake swaagat satkar kii samuchit vyavastha kii
 The Gods also got news of the Swayamvara of Damayanti through the Devarshi Narada and the mountain
 indra aadi sabhi lokapal bhi apni mandali or vaahanon sahit vidarbha desh ke liye ravaanaa hue
 Raja Nal's mind was already enamored on Damayanti
 unhone bhi damyanti ke swayamvar main sammilit hone ke liye vidarbha desh kii yatra kii
 While descending from heaven, the gods saw that beautiful tapes like Kamadev were going to the Swayamvara of Damayanti
 nal kii surya ke samaan kaanti or lokottar rup-sampatti se devtaa bhi chakit ho gayi
 He recognized that these are the taps
 unhone apane vimaanon ko akaash main khadaa kar diya or neeche utarkar nal se kaha—‘rajendra nal ! aap bade satyavrati hai
 You become a messenger to help us
 ’ nal ne pratigya kar lee or kaha ki ‘karunga’
 Then he asked, 'who are you and what is your job as a messenger?' Indra said - 'we are gods
 main indra hoon or ye agni, varun or yama hai
 We have come here for Damanti
 devataaon ne nal se kaha ki aap hamaare doot banakar damyanti ke paas jaaiye or kahie ki indra, varun, agni or yamadewataa tumhaare paas aakar tumse vivaah karnaa chaahate hai
 Whichever of these gods you accept as husband
 ’ nal ne donon haath jodakar kaha ki ‘devraj’ ! vahaan aap logon ke or mere jane kaa ek hi prayojan he
 That is why it is not appropriate that you send me as an angel
 jisaki kisi stri ko patni ke rup main paane kii ichha ho chuki ho, vah bhala, usko kaise chhod saktaa he or uske paas jaakar aisi baat kah hi kaise saktaa he ? aap log kripaya is vishay main mujhe kshamaa kijiye There was a Swayamvar of Damayanti in which not only the king of the earth, but also the gods came as a tap
 swayamvar main ek saath kai nal khadey the
 Everyone was upset about who the real tap would be
 lekin damyanti jaraa bhi vichlit nahin hui
 He recognized the real tap by eye
 saare devataaon ne bhi unka abhivadan kiya
 In this way, Damayanti recognized her real life and chose her life partner
 nav-dampatti ko devataaon kaa aashirwad praapt hua
 Damayanti nishad-naresh became the queen of King Nal
 donon bade sukh se samay bitaane lage
 Damyanti was a shiromani among husbandmen
 abhimaan to use kabhi chhu bhi na saktaa tha
 In time, a son and a girl were born from Damyanti's womb
 donon bachche mata-pita ke anuroop hi sundar rup or gunse sampann the
 Time does not always remain the same, the cycle of sorrow and happiness keeps going on
 vaise to maharaj nal gunavan, dharmatma tathaa punyashlok the, kintu unamem ek dosha tha —jue kaa vyasan
 One of Nal's brothers was named Pushkar
 vah nal se alag rahata tha
 He invited them for gambling
 khel armbh hua
 Luck was unfavorable
 nal haarane lage, sona, chaandi, rath, rajpaat sab haath se nikal gaya
 Knowing the unfavorable time, Queen Damayanti sent her two children to Kundinpur, the capital of Vidarbha country
 idhar nal jue main apana sarvasv haar gayi
 He removed all the clothes of his body
 keval ek vastra pahanakar nagar se baahar nikle
 Damayanti also followed her husband in just one sari
 ek din raja nal ne sone ke pankh vaale kuch pakshi dekhe
 King Nal thought, if these are captured, some money can be earned by selling them for sustenance
 aisa vichaarkar unhone apane pahanane kaa vastra kholkar pakshiyon par phenkaa
 Birds flew with the clothes
 ab raja nal ke paas tan dhakne ke liye bhi koi vastra na rah gaya
 Nal was more disturbed by Damayanti's misery than he was
 ek din donon jangal main ek vriksh ke neeche ek hi vastra se tan chipaaye pade the
 Damayanti fell asleep due to exhaustion
 raja nal ne sochaa, damyanti ko mere kaaran bada dukh sahan karnaa pad rahaa he
 If i leave it here at this stage, it will somehow reach its father
 yah vichaarkar unhone talwaar se uski aadhi sari ko kaat liya or usee se apana tan dhakkar tathaa damyanti ko usee avasthaa main chhod kar ve chal diye
 When Damyanti fell asleep, poor lady found herself alone and Karun started mourning
 bhukh or pyaas se vyakul hokar vah achaanak ajgar ke paas chali gayi or ajgar use nigalane laga
 Hearing Damyanti's scream, a hunter saved him from being a dragon
 kintu vyaadh swabhaav se dusht tha
 He was fascinated by the beauty of Damayanti and wanted to make him a victim of his job
 damyanti use shaap dete hue boli—‘yadi maine apane pati raja nal ko chhodkar kisi anya purush kaa kabhi chintan na kiya ho to is paapi vyaadh ke jivan kaa abhi ant ho jaay
 Hunter's death was reached as soon as Damayanti was fulfilled
 daivayog se bhatakate hue damyanti ek din chedinaresh subahu ke paas or uske baad apane pita ke paas pahunch gayi
 Finally, one day Maharaj Nal's sorrows also came to an end with the influence of the Satyatta of Damayanti
 donon kaa punarmilan hua or raja nal ko unka rajya bhi waapas mil gaya
 Nal and Damayanti had two twin sons Namah and Dal

 syadawaad jain darshan ke antargat kisi vastu ke gun ko samajhane, samajhane or abhivyakt karne kaa saapekshik siddhant he
 According to Jainism, any thing has eternal qualities
 mukt yaa kaivalya praapt sadhak ko hi anant gunon kaa gyaan sambhav he
 Knowledge of ordinary humans is partial and relative
 vastu kaa yah aanshik gyaan hi jain darshan main nay kehalaata he
 There are different approaches to understanding any object
 ye nay satya ke aanshik rup kahe jate hai
 With partial and relative knowledge only the attainment of relative truth is possible, not the attainment of absolute truth
 saapeksh satya kii prapti ke kaaran hi kisi bhi vastu ke sambandh main saadhaaran vyakti kaa nirnay sabhi drushtiyon se satya nahin ho saktaa
 The reason for differences between people is that they start to consider their views as very true and ignore the views of others
 vichaaron ko taarkik rup se abhivyakt karne or gyaan kii saapekshata kaa mahatv darshane ke liye hi jain darshan ne syadawaad yaa saptabhangi nay kaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya he
 In order to make sense of relative knowledge, the use of Syatvada has been instructed at the beginning of every new in Jain philosophy
 yahan dhyaan rakhana chahie ki 'syat' kaa arth 'shaayad' nahin he
 Jains exemplify this through an elephant and six blind persons
 sabhi netraheen gyaan kii uplabdhta or us tak pahunch kii seemaa kaa bodh karaate hai
 If one tells an elephant on the basis of limited experience that an elephant is told like a pole, rope, wall, python or fan, then it only expresses its partial knowledge and relative truth
 yadi isi anubhav main 'syat' shabd jod diya jaay to mat dosharahit mana jaataa he
 That is, if it is said - 'symbol elephant is like a pole or rope', then the vote would be considered logically correct
 saapekshik gyaan kii taarkikta ke aadhaar par jain darshan main nirnay yaa mat ke saat prakaar maane gayi hai
 This classification of empirical judgment or opinion by Jain philosophy is called Saptabhangi Nay
 yah pehla mat he
 For example, if it is said that 'the elephant is like a pillar', it would mean that in a particular country, time and situation, the elephant is like a pillar
 yah mat bhavatmak he
 This is a negative opinion
 is pariprekshya main hathi ke sambandh main mat is prakaar hona chahie ki- syat hathi is kamare ke bheetar nahin he
 This does not mean that there are no elephants in the room
 syat shabd is tathy kaa bodh karaata he ki vishesh rup, rang, aakaar or prakaar kaa hathi is kamare ke bheetar nahin he
 In the realization of which the elephant is like a wall or rope, this new form is used as a negative opinion
 syat shabd se us hathi kaa bodh hota he jo mat diye jane ke samay kamare main upasthit nahin he
 This view means that the power of the object may or may not be from a particular point of view
 hathi ke udhaaharan ko dhyaan main rakhen to vah khambhe ke samaan ho bhi sakati he or nahin bhi ho sakati he
 In such circumstances only 'siyat hai and not Siyaat' can be used
 yadi kisi mat main paraspar virdohi gunon ke sambandh main ek saath vichaar karnaa ho to us vishay main syat avaktavyam kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 With respect to the elephant, it can sometimes happen that it cannot be said with certainty whether it is like a pillar or a rope
 aisi sthiti main hi syat avaktavyam kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are some questions about which it is appropriate to remain silent, or to say that nothing definite can be said about it
 jain darshan kaa yah chauthaa paraamarsh is baat kaa pramaan he ki ve virodh ko ek dosha ke rup main sweekaar karte hai
 An object or event can happen at the same time and yet it is possible that nothing can be said about it
 kisi vishesh drushtikon se hathi ko rassi jaisaa kaha ja saktaa he

 Humayun became an exiled ruler from 1540, reaching the Safavid court in 1554 while still some forts and small areas were controlled by his army
 lekin sher shah suri ke nidhan ke baad jab pashtun avyavashtha main gir gaya, tab humayun ek mishrit sena ke saath laute, adhik sainikon ko batora or 1555 main dilli ko punah jeetne main kaamyaab rahe
 Humayun crossed the rough areas of Makran with his wife, but left his infant son Jalaluddin behind to avoid the ruthlessness of the journey
 jilaluddin ko baad ke varshon main akbar ke naam se behatar janaa gaya
 He was born in Amarkot, a Rajput city in Sindh where his uncle Askari raised him

 He established a skilled officer class and was tolerant of religious dogma, which softened the resistance of the conquered people
 unhone rajputon ke saath gathbandhan kiya or hindu generalon or prashaskon ko niyukt kiya tha
 Jahangir, son of Emperor Akbar of Umairids, ruled the empire between 1605–1627
 oktober 1627 main, umairids ke samraat jahangir ke bete shahjahan singhaasana ke uttaradhikari bane, jahaan unhen bharat main ek vishaal or samrudh samrajya viraasat main mila
 It was probably the largest empire in the world in the mid-century

 Electricity has been in use for a long time and as a result of continuous investigation, many types of electrical devices are being used in today's era
 kisi chaalak main vidyut dhara bahane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki chaalak ke donon siron ke bich kuch vibhavantar ho jise volt main mapa jaataa he
 The unit of measurement of electric current is ampere
 jab yah dhara kisi chaalak main pravaahit hoti he, to do prakaar ke prabhaav dikhaai padate hai : All these effects of current are used variously in current measuring methods
 iske atirikt, yadi kisi chaalak ke paas chumbakeey kshetra main parivartan ho yaa do prakaar ke chaalkon ke sangam ko garam kiya jaae yaa kuch rasinic kriya ho, tab vidyudvahak bal utpann hota he
 Many instruments depend on these principles
 yadi kinhin do chaalak pindon ke bich vibhavantar ho to unke bich aakarshan hota he
 The difference can also be measured by measuring this attraction
 yadi vidyunmay kan yaa electron nirvaat main prakshepit ho to vidyutiya yaa chumbakeey kshetra ke prabhaav se unne path ko modaa ja saktaa he
 a particular class of electrical equipment has resistance measuring tips
 kisi chaalak ke siron ke vibhavantar ko uske pratirodh se, jo om main maapi jaati he bhaag diya jaae to chaalak se pravaahit dhara kaa maan ampiore main gyaat ho jaataa he
 This is called Ohm's law
 kisi bhi paripath main kisi samay jitani vidyut shakti vyay ho rahi he uskaa maan wat main mapa jaataa he or vah is samay ke vibhavantar or dhara ke gunanfal ke baraabar hoti he
 The electric power is measured by a wattometer
 saadharantaya urja kilowat ghanta yaa board ov trade ikai main maapi jaati he
 When measuring power in kilowatts and time in hours, the power value is equal to their product
 yah urjamapi se mapa jaataa he
 If the differential of the electric current is fixed, then it would be sufficient to measure the product of the current and the time and which the power meter can show
 yadi kisi paripath main dhara badalati rahati ho or yah vishesh rup se ucch aavriti kii ho, to prerakatv tathaa vidyudharita do anya gunon hai jinhen jaananaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The value of inductance is equal to the magnetic conductance that surrounds the conductor
 vidyucchumbakeey niyam ke anusaar jab kabhi yah dhara ghatati, yaa badhati he, tab chaalak me ek vidyutvahak bal utpann hota he, jo is parivartan ko rokna chahta he
 The unit of persuasion is Henry, named after physics expert Joseph Henry
 yadi kisi chaalak main dhara kaa maan ek ampiore prati second bade or usamen isse ek volt kaa vibhavantar utnann ho jaae to is chaalak kaa praren ek henry hota he
 The effect of electromagnetism is just the opposite, because the alternating current cannot flow through the facility and the direct current cannot flow
 dharita kii samanta ek lacheelee kamaani se kii ja sakati he, jo sthir bal ke kaaran thodaa badhkar ruk jaati he, parantu parivartansheel bal ke prabhaav main dolit hoti rahati he
 Electrification mainly has three effects - magnetic effect, thermal effect, and chemical effect
 in teenon main se kisi bhi prabhaav ko vidyuddhara kii upasthiti or uskaa maan gyaat karne ke liye kaam main laa sakate hai, parantu yatharthata or saralata ke kaaran praaia: sarvatra chumbakeey prabhaav hi kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 There are two types of dielectric: dekhen : dharamapi The tangent brometer is the most simple and useful movable magnetometer

 The scale is divided into four quadrants and each quartile has signs ranging from 0 degrees to 90 degrees
 jab chumbakeey sooyee chumbakeey yamyottar main hoti he, to sanketak shunya ansh par rahata he
 When electric current flows in a coil placed in a magnetic field, a coaxial force acts on the coil, which it begins to rotate
 is siddhant ko kaam main laakar jo dharamapi banaae gaye, hai unhen chalkundal dharamapi kehete hai
 It consists of a rectangular coil with thin and electrified copper wire
 yah kundali phasphar branj kii bahut patali pattee dwaara ek pench se lataki rahati he, kundali kaa ek sira isi pattee se judaa rahata he or pattee kaa sambandh dharamapi ke e sanyojak pench se hota he
 The leaf also has a circular plane or concave mirror, which rotates along the leaf
 kundali kaa doosraa sira dhaatu kii ek sarpil kamaani se judaa rahata he, jiskaa sambandh duusare sanyojak pench se hota he
 This coil hangs between the poles of a powerful permanent umbilical magnet
 chumbak ke dhruv natodar belanaakaar akruti main kate rahete hai
 a soft iron small cylinder is enclosed in the back of the Dharmapi by a screw inside the coil between the two pole segments
 ye sab vastuen ek achumbakeey baks main band rakhi jaati hai
 Glass is placed in the front of the box, so that the mirror can be measured by deflection lamp and scale method
 jab kundali main vidyut dhara pravaahit hoti he, tab kundali ke do bhujaaon par balyugma kaary karata he or kundali ko uski sthiravastha se ghuma detaa he, jisase phosphor branj kii pattee or neeche kii sarpil kamaani main anthan aa jaati he or e anthan bal yugma kundali par vipareet disha main kaary karne lagata he
 Due to which the horoscope is soon in balance
 dekhen - ameter # chal loh ameter This type of thermometer depends on the thermal effect of the current
 jab dhara kisi chaalak se pravaahit hoti he, tab vah chaalak tapt ho jaataa he
 The value of the generated heat is proportional to 2 x
 yadi dhara ampiore main or pratirodh om main ho, to The value of heat is proportional to the square of the current, that is, it is not dependent on the direction of current
 isliye aise dharamapi disht athwa prayavarti dhara donon hi ke naapane ke prayog main laae ja sakate hai
 See, dynamometer yah yantra vishesh rup se ucch-aavritiwali bahut ksheen or kshanik prayavarti dhara ko naapane ke prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 It usually consists of a silver-plated crystal coil, a powerful electromagnet
 donon dhruv khandon main gol chhidr bane rahete hai, jinase ek samaantar prakaash kiranwali ek ore se duusari ore nikalati he
 One is the light source and lens towards the pole section and towards the other pole section is either the telescope or the film camera
 prakaash kiranavali dwaara doordarshee kii netrika yaa camera ke film par tane hue taar kii chaaya padati he
 When any weak and transient current flows through this wire, according to Fleming's law, a force acts on the wire, whose direction is perpendicular to both the current and the magnetic field
 is bal ke kaaran taar apni jagah se hatati he or chaaya bhi hatati he
 When a record of a transient or alternating current is to be taken, the camera film is moved by a meter and the current is flown into the wire
 photo ke film par dhara kaa abhilekh ban jaataa he
 When a weak direct current is measured, then the micrometer is installed in place of the camera
 disht dhara jab taar se pravaahit hoti he, tab taar kii chaaya ek ore hat jaati he
 The micrometers measure the displacement of the shadow from the ophthalmic membrane, resulting in the value of the current
 yah atyant sugrahi or upyogi dharamapi he
 It is mostly used to sense the alternating voltage, or wave form of the current
 vastut: yah ek mritspand dharamapi he, jisaki prakritik dolan aavriti bahut adhik hoti he or jiske chalanshil bhaagon kaa jadtv bahut kam hota he
 a direct current measuring ammeter is mostly a magnetometer thermometer, parallel to which a flux wire is connected

 Nowadays digital oscillators are being replaced in place of cathode ray oscillators whose curtains, modern LCD, LED, touch screen etc
 are based on technology
 yadi vidyutdhara kisi vidyudvilleshya drav se pravaahit ho, to us drav main ynikaran hota he
 As a result, the ion ions are depressed at the cathode and the minus ion at the anode
 farade ke niyamon ke anusaar ynikaran kii maatra dharaman kii samaanupati hoti he
 Here the value of current is dependent on the amount of ions and the time of fluency, which are the fundamental quantities
 isi ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya samiti ne antarrashtriya ekak kii vyakhya is prakaar kii he : This device is used in the measurement of potential difference, but at the same time it can also be used to determine the resistance and resistance
 disht dhara vibhavamaapi kii bhaanti hi prayavartti dhara vibhavamaapi bhi vibhavantar naapta he
 In both types of instruments, the unknown potential is perfectly balanced by the partial differential of the main circuit of the voltmeter, but the potential of the alternating current brought to equilibrium in the voltmeter should not only be equal in magnitude but also in the opposite direction in phase
 And two independent adjustments are required
 prayavarti dhara vibhavamaapi do virgon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai jinhen dhruviya or nirdenshanki kehete hai
 The post office box is a box with known resistance

19895 Huayna Picchu, Wayana Picchu or Wayana Picchu, is a mountain located in the Machupichu district of Urubamba province in the Cuzco region of Peru, on the banks of the Urubamba River
 huayna pichchu kii chotii kii oonchaai samudr tal se 2,720 meter he or yah maachu pichchu se lagbhag 360 meter unchi he
 It rises above Machu Picchu, the so-called lost city of the Inca civilization, and divides the city into various blocks
 inkaaon main huayna pichchu ke kinare kinare, neeche se upar tak ek maarg kaa nirmaan kiya tha or iske sheersh par ek mandir or praangan banaaya gaya tha
 According to local exhibitors, the peak of the mountain was inhabited by high priests and local kumaris
 har subah suryoday se pehle mahayajak ek chote samooh ke saath maachu pichchu aata tha or logon ko ek nai subah ke aane ke sanket detaa tha
 One of the three major temples in the Machu Picchu region, the Moon Temple is located on the edge of a mountain and at a lower elevation than Machu Picchu
 chandramaa ke mandir se sata mahaan gupha mandir he
 Other major temples located at Machu Picchu include the local Kondor temple, the Trivatayan temple, the main temple, the "unfinished temple" and the Sun Temple, also known as the Torion

 Linguistics is that branch of language study in which scientific and analytical study of the origin, nature, development, etc
 of the language is done
 bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayeta 'bhashavigyaani' kehalaate hai
 Linguistics is different from grammar
 vyakaran main kisi bhashaa kaa kaaryaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he jabaki bhashavigyaani iske aage jaakar bhashaa kaa atyant vyapak adhyayan karata he
 Among the many subjects of study, linguistics is being given special importance nowadays
 bhashaa-sambandhi is adhyayan ko europe main aaj tak anek naamon or sangyaaon se abhihit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Firstly this study was added a word as an adjective next to the word Philology - then it was called as "comparative Philology"
 unnisvin shatabdi tak vyakaran tathaa bhashaa-vishyak adhyayan ko praayah ek hi samajha jaataa tha
 Hence, scholars also named it 'comparative Grammar'
 france main isko langistik naam diya gaya
 The name "linguistique" or "linguistics" has been prevalent in the whole of Europe in the nineteenth century due to the greater language related work in France
 iske atirikt 'science of language', ‘glautoleji’ aadi anya naam bhi is vishay ko prakat karne ke liye kaam main aaye
 Of all these names, "linguistics", "philology" are used only today
 bharatvarsh main in sabhi europea naamon ke atirikt hindi bhashaa main jo naam prayog main laae jate hai ve is prakaar hai- ‘‘bhashaa-shaastra’’, ‘‘bhashaa-tatva’’, ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’, tathaa ‘‘tulanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan’’ aadi
 Among all these names, the most common name is "linguistics"
 in naam main pracheen or naveen sabhi naamon kaa samaahaar-sa hua jaan padataa he
 Therefore, this name seems to be suitable for this scripture
 apane vartmaan swaroop main bhashaa vigyaan pashchimi vidwaanon ke mastishk kii dein kaha jaataa he
 The trend of language-related studies is found in Sanskrit literature since very ancient times
 ‘shiksha’ naamak vedang main bhashaa sambandhi sookshm charchaa uplabdh hoti he
 Detailed description of the pronunciation of the sounds - elements, location, effort etc
 is available in these texts
 ‘praatishakhya’ evam nirukt main shabdon kii vyutpatti, dhaatu, upsarg-pratyay aadi vishyon par vaigyanik vishleshan bhashaa kaa vaigyanik adhyayan kaha ja saktaa he
 Under Bhartrihari's book 'sentence Pad', subtle, deep and comprehensive thinking of the form of 'word' is available
 vahaan shabd ko ‘brahm’ ke rup main pariklpit kiya gaya he or uski ‘akshar’ sangya bataai gai he
 It is, by default, a language-related book
 sanskrit-sahitya main darshan evam sahityashastreey granthon main bhi hamen ‘shabd’ ’arth’, ‘ras’ ‘bhav’ ke sookshm vivechan ke antargat bhashaa vaigyanik charchaaon ke hi sanket praapt hote hai’ sanskrit-sahitya main yatra-tatra uplabdh hone vaali bhashaa-vichaar-vishyak saamagree hi nishchit rup se vartmaan bhashaa-vigyaan kii aadharshila kahi ja sakati he
 Linguistics as a modern subject is thought to have originated in Europe in 1786 AD by a scholar named Sir William Jones
 sanskrit bhashaa ke adhyayan ke prasang main sar wiliam jones ne hi sarvapratham sanskrit, greek or latin bhashaa kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hue is sambhaavna ko vyakt kiya tha ki sambhawatah in teenon bhashaaon ke mul main koi ek bhashaa rup hi aadhaar bana hua he
 Therefore, there exists a subtle formula between these three languages
 bhashaaon kaa is prakaar kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan hi aadhunaki bhashaa-vigyaan ke kshetra kaa pehla kadam bana
 Two terms have been used in the name "linguistics"
 ‘‘bhashaa’’ tathaa ‘‘vigyaan’’
 Before understanding linguistics, it seems necessary to be familiar with both these words
 ‘bhashaa’ shabd sanskrit kii ‘‘bhash’’ dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Which means - express speech
 ‘vigyaan’ shabd main ‘vi’ upsarg tathaa ‘gya’ dhaatu se ‘lut’ pratyay lagane par banataa he
 In general, 'bhasha' means 'spoken language or dialect' and 'vigyan' means 'special knowledge', but only after understanding the clear and comprehensive meaning of these two terms used in the word 'linguistics'
 We will be able to know the essence of this name
 atah ham yahan in donon padon ke vistrut arth ko spasht karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Language: Human being is a social animal
 samaaj main apane bhaavon or vichaaron ko ek duusare tak pahunchane kii aavashyaktaa chirkaal se anubhav kii jaati rahi he
 Thus the existence of language proves to be very ancient in human society
 maanav ke sampoorn gyaan-vigyaan kaa prakaashan karne ke liye, sabhyataa or samskruti ke itihaas ko jaanane ke liye bhashaa ek mahatvapurn saadhan kaa kaary karti he
 We have come to know all the ordinary and extraordinary experiences from our ancestors through language
 hamaare sabhi sadgranthon or shastron se milane vaala gyaan bhashaa par hi nirbhar he
 Mahakavi Dandi has written in his great book 'kavyadarsha' informing the importance of language: - arthath yah sampoorn bhuwan andhkarpurn ho jaataa, yadi sansar main shabd-swaroop jyoti arthath bhashaa kaa prakaash na hota
 It is clear that this statement has been said to target human language
 pashu-pakshi bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye jin dhvaniyon kaa aashray lete hai ve unke bhaavon kaa vahan karne ke kaaran unke liye bhashaa ho sakati hai kintu maanav ke liye aspasht hone ke kaaran vidwaanon ne use ‘avyakt vaak’ kaha he, jo bhashaa-vigyaan kii drushti se koi mahatva nahin rakhti
 Because in 'avyakta speech' both the words and meanings remain unclear
 manushya bhi kabhi-kabhi apane bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye ang-bhangima, bhru-sanchaalan, haath-paanv-mukhaakriti aadi ke sanketon kaa prayog karte hai parantu vah bhashaa ke rup main hote hue bhi ‘vyakt vaak’ nahin he
 The greatest feature of human language is that it is 'articulated speech', that is, having clarity of words and meanings
 mahabhashya ke rachayita patanjali ke anusaar ‘vyakt vaak’ kaa arth bhashaa ke varnanaatmak hone se hi he
 It is true that sometimes even with the help of signs and disguises, our sentiments and thoughts are transmitted very easily
 is prakaar ve cheshtaayen bhashaa ke pratik ban jaati hai kintu maanav bhaavon ko prakat karne kaa sabase upyukt saadhan vah varnanaatmak bhashaa he jise ‘vyakt vaak’ kii sangya pradaan kii gai he
 In this, certain accented or perceived sounds are taken to reveal different meanings
 atah bhashaa ham un shabdon ke samooh ko kehete hai jo vibhinn arthon ke sanketon se sampann hote hai
 By whom we can easily reveal our feelings to others
 is prakaar bhashaa kii paribhaasha karte hue ham use maanav-samaaj main vichaaron or bhaavon kaa aadan-pradaan karne ke liye apanaaya jane vaala ek madhyam kah sakate hai jo maanav ke uccharan avyavon se prayatnpurvak nicksruth kii gai dhvaniyon kaa sarthak aadhaar liye rahata he
 Those phonemes take the form of words when they are attached to a meaning
 sampoorn dhwani-vyapaar arthath shabd-samooh apane arth ke saath ek ‘yadrichhik’ sambandh par aadhaarit hota he
 'random' means completely fictitious
 sankshep main vibhinn arthon main vyakt kiye gaye mukh se uccharit us shabd samooh ko ham bhashaa kehete hai jiske dwaara ham apane bhav or vichaar dusron tak pahunchaate hai
 We have many benefits from the study of linguistics, such as- 1
 apni chir-parichit bhashaa ke vishay main jigyaasa kii tripti yaa shankaaon kaa nirmulan
 2
 Introduction to historical and prehistoric culture
 3
 kisi jati yaa sampoorn maanavtaa ke maansik vikaas kaa parichay
 4
 Solution of many problems related to the meaning, pronunciation and use of ancient literature
 5
 vishwa ke liye ek bhashaa kaa vikaas
 6
 Assistance in learning foreign languages
 7
 anuwaad karne vaali tathaa swayan tip karne vaali evam isi prakaar kii mashiinon ke vikaas or nirmaan main sahaayta
 8
 Assistance in change in terms of simplicity, correctness etc
 in language, script etc
 in sabhi laabhon kii drushti se aaj ke yug main bhashaa-vigyaan ko ek atyant upyogi vishay mana ja rahaa he or uske adhyayan ke kshetra main nity naveen vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is a natural object that is found as a divine gift to humans
 bhashaa kaa nirmaan manushya ke mukh se swaabhaavik rup main nicksruth dhvaniyon ke dwaara hota he
 The common knowledge of the language becomes available to all who speak and hear it
 yahi bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan kehalaata he
 Next, when did language become, how did it become? What was its initial and ancient form? When and what changes did it happen and what are the reasons for those changes? Or how did the language develop overall? What are the reasons for that development? Which language has so much similarity or dissimilarity with which other language? All this will be called special knowledge of language or 'linguistics'
 isi bhashaa-vigyaan ke vishesh rup arthath bhashaa vigyaan ko aaj adhyayan kaa ek mahatvapurn vishay maan liya gaya he
 When the subjects of linguistics were included under the syllabus of large classes, a natural question first arose whether linguistics should be counted under art or in science
 arthath bhashaa-vigyaan kala he athwa vigyaan he
 It was decided to take the process and conclusions of the study that in reality it should be considered as pure science like physics, and chemistry etc
 or to be accepted as art like painting, music, sculpture, poetry etc
 kala kaa sambandh maanav-jati vastuon yaa vishyon se hota he
 This is why art is individual or completely individual
 vyakti saapeksh hone ke saath-saath kisi desh vishesh or kaal-vishesh kaa bhi kala par prabhaav rahata he
 This means that the values that remain for art in a period, new changes are present in the future and they should be accepted in other countries also, it is not necessary
 ek vyakti ko kisi vastu main ucch kalatmak abhivyakti lag rahi he
 But to others she does not look like this
 atah kala kii dharna prayek vyakti kii bhinn-bhinn hua karti he
 Art is related to the emotional instinct of the human heart
 usamen vyakti kii soundaryanubhuti kaa put mila rahata he
 The purpose of art is also to provide beauty, or to provide joy, not to do an elemental analysis of something
 kala ke swaroop kii in sabhi visheshtaon kii kasuti par parakhane se gyaat hota he ki bhashaa-vigyaan kala nahin he
 Because it is not related to the plausibility of the heart but to the philosophical view of the intellect
 bhashaa-vigyaan kaa uddeshy soundaryanubhuti karana yaa manoranjan karana bhi nahin he
 That makes our intellectual thinking sharp
 bhashaa ke astitv kaa tattvik moolyankan karata he
 His approach is rational
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke nishkarsh kisi vyakti, raashtra yaa kaal ke aadhaar par parivartit nahin hote hai tathaa bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan kaa mul aadhaar jo bhashaa he vah maanavkrut padaarth nahin he
 Therefore, we cannot count linguistics in the field of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii upyogita isamen he ki vah bhashaa sikhaane kii kala kaa gyaan karaata he
 For this reason, Sweet has called grammar a language as both an art and a science
 bhashaa kaa shuddh uccharan, prabhaavshaalee prayog kala kii koti main rakhe ja sakate hai
 Linguistics cannot be kept within the limits of art, when it is decided that the question arises as to whether linguistics, physics, chemistry etc
 are subjects like science? anek vidwaanon kii dharna main bhashaa-vigyaan vishuddh vigyaan nahin he
 According to his belief, all the experiments of linguistics have not yet been achieved to perfection and hence its conclusions cannot be called final conclusions
 iske saath hi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi nishkarsh vigyaan kii bhanti saarvbhaumik or saarvkalik bhi nahin he
 Just as mathematics has 2 + 2 = 4 everlasting, inferential conclusions that are universally accepted, linguistics does not have an unquestionable conclusion of this kind
 vigyaan main tathyon kaa sankalan or vishleshan hota he or dhwani ke niyam adhikanshtah vikalparahit hi hai, atah kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar bhashaa-vigyaan ko manviki evam vigyaan ke madhya main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 After considering it, we see that in today's fast progress of science, every particular knowledge is becoming old and unscientific in front of its upcoming knowledge
 nity naveen avishkaron ke aaj ke yug main vaigyanik drushti nity sookshm se sookshmatar or naveen se navyatar hoti chali ja rahi he
 In view of today's developed field of knowledge, many scientific beliefs have become outdated and faded
 newton kaa prakaash siddhanth bhi ab sandeh kii drushti se dekha jane laga he
 This proves that in the light of new knowledge, ancient knowledge is also excluded from the field of science
 atah vishuddh gyaan kii drushti se vichaar karne par bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham vigyaan ke hi seemaa-kshetra main pate hai
 Linguistics is definitely a science under which we gain special knowledge of language
 yah sahi he ki abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan kaa vaigyanik str par purnatah vikaas nahin ho paaya he
 This is the reason why Grasmann and Werner had to improve by following the famous Grimm-rule
 ukt sudhaaron se purv grim kaa dhwani niyam nischit niyam hi mana jaataa tha or sudhaaron ke baad bhi vah nischit niyam hi mana jaataa he
 Thus, there is no opposition to science due to the refutation of old principles in the light of new knowledge
 vastav main yahi shuddh vigyaan he
 After 1930, where descriptive linguistics gained importance again, there has been rapid development since then
 jab se dhwani ke kshetra main yantron kii sahaayta se naye-naye pareekshan prarambh hue hai tathaa praapt nishkarsh puri tarah niyamit hone lage hai, tab se hi bhashaa-vigyaan dhire-dhire pragati karata hua vigyaan kii shrenee main mana jane laga he
 One of the great features of science is its experimentalism
 america vidvan balum feeld ke baad america bhashaa vigyaniyon ne dhwani-vigyaan evam rup-vigyaan aadi ke saath bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paddati ke rup main praayogic bhashaa-vigyaan kaa badi tivrata ke saath vikaas kiya he
 Under this method, linguistics is becoming the subject of laboratories and many instruments have been invented for it
 yah dekh kar nishchit rup main is vishay ko vigyaan hi kaha jayega, isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin he
 Nowadays, where the tradition of using the word science has been done for the classical subjects like sociology, psychology etc
, then linguistics based on pure cause-work tradition cannot be called as inappropriate from any point of view
 dow shyamsundar das ne apane granth bhashaa rahasy main likhaa he- In the words of Mangal Dev Shastri dow bholanath tiwari ke ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ granth main yah paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he- By considering all the definitions given above, it is known that there is no difference between them
 dow shyamsundar das kii paribhaasha main jahaan keval bhashavigyaan par hi drushti kendrit rahi he vahin mangaldev shastri evam bholanath tiwari ne apni paribhaashaon main bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayan ke prakaaron ko bhi samahit kar liya he
 Definitions are good that are concise and clear
 is prakaar ham bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paribhaasha is prakaar de sakate hai- “jis adhyayan ke dwaara maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vishleshnatmak adhyayan kiya jaae, use bhashaa-vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 " duusare shabdon main bhashaa-vigyaan vah he jisamen maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vyapak vaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Except the current form of language, the rest of the study material is available only from literature to linguistics
 yadi aaj hamaare saamne sanskrit, greek or avesta sahitya na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan kabhi yah jaanane main safal na hota ki ye teenon bhashaayen kisi ek mul bhashaa se nikali hai
 Similarly, if Hindi literature from the early to modern period was not in front of us, how could linguistics study the historical development of Hindi language? bhashaa-vigyaan kisi prakaar se bhi bhashaa kaa adhyayan kare use pag-pag par sahitya kii sahaayta leni padati he
 Hearing this from the mouth of the naughty boys of Bundelkhand- vyakaran kahata he ki yah kya bhalaa he, pracheen sahitya kaa adhyayan hi use batalaayegaa ki shakatayan ke pratham sutara ‘uun namah siddham’ kaa hi yah bigadaa hua rup he
 Literature also succeeds in finding solutions to many of its problems with the help of linguistics
 dow vasudev sharan agarwal ne bhashaa-vigyaan ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par jysikrut ‘padmavat’ ke bahut se shabdon ko unke mul roopon se jod kar unke arthon ko spasht kiya he
 It has also taken substantial help in determining the pure text
 atah sahitya or bhashaa-vigyaan donon ek duusare ke sahaayak hai
 Language is a reflection of our thoughts and thoughts, so with the help of language many problems can be solved
 vishesh rup se arthvigyaan to manovigyaan par puri tarah se aadhaarit he
 Psychology also provides adequate help in the study of syntax
 kabhi-kabhi dhwani-parivartan kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye bhi manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Child psychology and psychology of underdeveloped people also helps us in knowing the origin and initial form of language
 manovigyaan ko bhi apni chikitsa-paddati main rogi kii ulajlul baton kaa arth jaanane ke liye bhashaa-vigyaan se sahaayta leni padati he
 Therefore, with the help of linguistics, a psychologist can be successful in detecting the patient's ailments
 bhashaa-vigyaan or manovigyaan ke ghanishtha sambandhon ke kaaran hi aajkal bhashaa manovigyaan yaa psycolinginvasticks naamak ek nayi adhyayan-paddati kaa vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is called the sound emanating from the mouth, so in linguistics, how does the air move from within, what changes do it cause due to larynx, larynx, nasal cavity, crow, palate, teeth, tongue, lip, throat, hoarseness and nose and One has to study how sound is received by the ear
 isamen sharir-vigyaan hi uski sahaayta karata he
 Eclipse of written language is done by eye and study of this process is also done under linguistics
 iske liye bhi use sharir vigyaan kaa rini hona padataa he
 Linguistics and geography also have a deep connection
 kuch logon ke anusaar kisi sthaan kii bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa uski bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 In the language spoken in a place, there are definitely words for trees, plants, birds, animals and food etc
 But if any of them ends, then its name also gets attached to the language there
 ‘somalata’ shabd kaa prayog aaj hamaari bhashaa main nahin hota
 The reason for this omission is probably geographical
 kisi sthaan main ek bhashaa kaa dur tak prasar na hona, bhashaa main kam vikaas hona tathaa kisi sthaan main bahut si boliyon kaa hona bhi bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa hi parinaam hota he
 The castes living on inaccessible mountains are unable to spread their dialect due to low mutual contact
 nadiyon ke aar-paar rahane vaale logon kii boli-bhashaa saamaanya bhashaa se hat kar bhinn hoti he
 In doing linguistic studies of the names of countries, cities, rivers and provinces etc
, geography provides great recreational material
 arth-vichaar ke kshetra main bhi bhugol bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta karata he
 Geography also helps in considering the problems of 'camel', how camel came out of buffalo and why 'sandhava' means horse and salt
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek shakha bhashaa-bhugol kii adhyayan-paddati to thik bhugol kii hi bhanti hoti he
 Similarly, linguistics is also helpful in studying the geography of prehistoric times of a place
 itihaas kaa bhi bhashaa-vigyaan se ghanishtha sambandh he
 With regard to three forms of history, political history, religious history, social history - its relation with linguistics is being shown here
 bhashavigyaan ke adhyayan main tarkshastra, bhautikashastra evam maanav-shaastra jaise anya gyaan ke kshetra bhi badi sahaayta pahunchaate hai
 Many kinds of superstitions in humans take place which affect their language
 bhartiya saamaj main striyaan apane pati kaa naam ghuma-firaakar leti he, sidhaa-spasht nahin
 At night giant insects are not named
 ve apane ladke kaa naam maange, chhedi, bechu, ghurhu, katvaaru alichaar yaa lenda, aadi rakhte hai
 Apart from superstitions, many other socio-psychology related clauses have to resort to the branches of anthropology
 is prakaar gyaan ke anek kshetra- samskruti-adhyayan, shikshashastra, sankhyikee, paath-vigyaan - aadi bhashaa vigyaan se gaharaa sambandh rakhte hai
 The field of human language is the field of linguistics
 sansarbhar ke sabhy-asabhy manushyon kii bhashaaon or boliyon kaa adhyayan bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 In this way, linguistics does not only study civilized-literary languages, but also the study of those languages which are lost in the pride of the past, which are not in vogue, barbaric-unfriendly dialects
 vishay-vibhaajan kii drushti se bhashavigyaan ko bhashaa-sanrachana evam 'arth kaa adhyayan' main baanta jaataa he
 In it, apart from analyzing and describing the language from a scientific point of view, comparative studies between different languages are also done
 bhashavigyaan ke do paksh hai- tattvik or vyavhaarik
 In addition, linguistics has a deep connection with other branches of knowledge science
 isse samajabhashavigyaan, manobhashavigyaan, gananamulak bhashavigyaan, aadi isaki vibhinn shakhaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The following are the minor areas of linguistics: vaakya-vigyaan : bhashaa main sara vichaar-vinimay vaakyon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 The department of linguistics in which it is considered is called syntax or syntax
 iske teen rup hai- Syntax is related to the psychology of the speaking society
 isliye bhashaa-vigyaan kii yah shakha bahut kathin he
 Morphology: The construction of a sentence is based on terms or forms
 atah vaakya ke baad pad yaa rup kaa vichaar mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 Under meteorology, all the instruments have to be considered from the metal, prefix, suffix etc
 shabd-vigyaan : rup yaa pad kaa aadhaar shabd he
 The words composition or history can be considered from these two points of view
 kisi vyakti yaa bhashaa kaa vichaar bhi iske antargat kiya jaataa he
 Thesaurus and etymology come under the limits of the field of word science itself
 bhashaa ke shabd samooh ke aadhaar par bolne vaale kaa saanskrithik itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 Phonology: The basis of the word is sound
 dhwani-vigyaan ke antargat dhvaniyon kaa anek prakaar se adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Under it, phonology is a separate subdivision in which the sound-producing organs — buccal-vocal, nasal-vocal, vocal apparatus, sound-instrument, as well as the process of hearing are also studied
 is adhyayan ke do rup hai-aitihaasik or doosraa tulanaatmak
 The Grimm rule is related to this
 arth-vigyaan : vaakya kaa bahari ang dhwani par samaapt ho jaataa he yah bhashaa kaa bahari kalevar he iske aage uski aatma kaa kshetra prarambh hota he jise ham arth kehete hai
 a word without meaning is meaningless like a selfless body
 atah arth bhashaa kaa ek mahatvapurn ang hota he
 In semantics, the development of the meanings of words and its reasons are considered
 kisi bhi adhyayan ko ham vaigyanik tab kehete hai jab usamen ek nishchit prakriya ko apana kar chalate hai
 Linguistics is also tied to certain processes for the purposeful rational analysis of a language
 inhen prakriyaaon ke aadhaar par abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan ke paanch prakaar ke adhyayan hamen praapt hote hai- Language is usually studied with the following terms: varnatmak paddati dwaara ek hi kaal kii kisi ek bhashaa ke swaroop kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 For this, the principles highlighted in it, on the basis of which the creative features of language-specific can be explained
 dhyatavya he ki is paddati main ek saath vibhinn kaalon ko bhashaa kaa samavesh nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki har kaal kii bhashaa ke vishleshan ke liye pruthak-pruthak siddhanton kaa prayojan padegaa
 Panini is the largest linguist not only in India, but also in the world, who has done a detailed and comprehensive study of the language in descriptive form
 katyayan evam patanjali bhi isi koti main aate hai
 Among Greek scholars, Thrax, Discolus and Erodean also did notable work in this area
 panini se purna prabhavit hokar bluemfield ne san 1932 i
 main 'language' naamak apana granth prakashit karwaakar varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Descriptive linguistics has developed here in Western countries, especially in the United States
 kisi bhashaa me vibhinn kaalon main parivartanon par vichaar karnaa evam un parivartanon ke sambandh main siddhanto kaa nirmaan hi aitihaasik bhashavigyaan kaa uddeshy hota he
 The basic difference of the descriptive method is that the descriptive method is unicameral, where the historical method is bicameral
 sankrut bhashaa kii pracheenta ne aitihaasik paddati kii ore bhashavigyaniyon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 The main formulation of 'philology' was the comparative study of the languages of ancient texts
 mukhyatah sanskrit, german, greek, lotin jaisi bhashaaon par hi vidwaanon kaa dhyaan kendrit rahaa
 Frederick Auguste Wolf drew the attention of scholars to the historical method in the year 1777 itself
 vastutah, kisi bhi bhashaa ke vikasaatmak rup ko samajhane ke liye aitihaasik paddati kaa sahaara lenna hi padegaa
 What has changed in Old Hindi or Medieval Hindi and Modern Hindi can be explained only by historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati dwaara do yaa do se adhik bhashaaon kii tulana kii jaati he
 It can also be called a mixed method, because the basis of both the descriptive method and the historical method is taken
 vivaran ke liye kisi ek kaal ko nishchit karnaa hota he or tulana ke liye kam-se-kam do bhashaaon kii apeksha hoti he
 Thus, comparative method can be called the sum of descriptive method and historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati kinhin do bhashaaon par lagu ho sakati he
 For example, comparison is also done in Indian languages - Bhojpuri etc
