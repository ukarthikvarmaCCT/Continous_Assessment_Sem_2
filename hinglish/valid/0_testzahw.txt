 is upanyaas kaa sheershak 17 veen shatabdi ke irani kavi saib tabriji rachit kavita "kabul" ke anuwaad se liya gaya he : Oh, the beautiful city of Kabul wears a rugged mountain skirt, And the rose is jealous of its lash-like thorns
the dust of Kabul's blowing soil smarts lightly in my eyes, But i love her, for knowledge and love both come from her dust
 i sing bright praises to her colourful tulips,the beauty of her trees makes me blush
how sparkling the water flows from pul-i-mastaan!may Allah protect such beauty from the evil eye of man! Khizr chose Kabul to Paradise, for his mountains brought him near to heaven's delights
the fort's dragon-sprawling walls guard the city well, Each brick is more precious than the treasure of Shayagan
 Every street in Kabul fascinates the eye
in the bazaars, Egypt's caravans pass by
no one can count the beauteous moons on her rooftops, 'and hundreds of lovely suns hide behind her walls
' Her morning's laugh is as gay as flowers,her dark nights shine like beautiful hair
her tuneful nightingales sing with flame in their notes,fiery songs like burning leaves, fall from their throats
 i sing to the gardens, Jahanara and sharbara
even the tuba of Paradise is jealous of their greenery
 "every street of Kabul is enthralling to the eyethrough the bazaars, caravans of Egypt passone could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofsand the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls” Template: Good article dastakart armenia kaa ek samudaay he

 Data mining is the process of extracting patterns from data
 chunki adhik data ekatrit ho rahe hai, jisamen har teen varsh main data kii raashi doguna ho rahi he, data mining in data ko jaankaree main badalane ke liye teji se mahatvapurn upkaran banataa ja rahaa he
 It is commonly used to design detailed practices, such as marketing, surveillance, fraud detection, and scientific discovery
 ek ore jahaan data mining kaa prayog data namoonon main pattern ko ujagar karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, yah jaananaa bhi mahatvapurn he ki data ke gaiyr-pratinidhi namoonay kaa prayog aise parinaam utpann kar saktaa jo domen ke suchak nahin hai
 Similarly, data mining will not detect patterns that may exist in the domain, if those patterns are not present in the sample that is being "mined"
 parinaamon ko lekar aparyaapt jaankaar "upabhoktaaon" main ek pravriti he jo "data mining" ke liye "jaadui kshamta" dekhte hai or is takanic ko crystal ball ke samaan bilkul saafe dekhne ke madhyam ke rup main lete hai
 Like any other device, it works only in association with the appropriate raw material: in this case the pointer and representative data that must be stored by the user first
 Furthermore, the search for a particular pattern in a particular set of data does not necessarily represent the entire population of the pattern from which the data is derived
 isliye, is prakriya kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa he data ke anya namoonon par pattern kaa satyaapan or pramanikaranhai
 The term data mining has also been used in a related but negative sense, where it refers to a deliberate search for clear but not necessarily representative patterns in large numbers of data
 duusare bhav se bhram kii sthiti se bachane ke liye, data dreging or data snooping pad kaa aksar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Note that dredging and snooping can be used as an exploration tool when the hypothesis is being developed and clarified
 manushya sadiyon se "haathon se" data se pattern nikaalata rahaa he, lekin aadhunik samay main data kii badhati maatra ne adhik swachaalit tareekon ko jaruri bana diya he
 Early methods of identifying patterns in data include the Baas theorem and regression analysis
 The proliferation, ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology have increased data storage and storage
 chunki data set, aakaar or jatilta main bade ho gaye hai, pratyaksh vaastavik rup se aankadon ke vishleshan ko teji se apratyaksh, swachaalit data sansaadhan ke jariye sanvardhit kiya gaya he
 This has been further encouraged by other discoveries in computer science, such as neural networks, clustering, genetic algorithms, decision trees, and support vector machines
 Data mining is the process of applying these methods to data with the intention of revealing hidden patterns
 kai varshon se iskaa istemaal udyog, vaigyanikon or sarkaron dwaara aankadon kii maatra ko chaanane ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he jaise vimaan yatri yatra record, janaganana aankade or bazaar anusandhan report ko utpann karne ke liye supermarket scinar data
 
 Assistance in the analysis of the collection of behavioral findings is one of the main reasons for the use of data mining
 is tarah ke data, agyaat antarsambandh ke kaaran akerekhastata ke prati samvedansheel hote hai
 An unavoidable fact of data mining is that the data in the set being analyzed may not be representative of the entire domain and therefore may not include examples of some of the important relationships and behaviors that exist in other parts of the domain 
 is tarah kii samasya ko sulajhane ke liye, vishleshan ko prayog-aadhaarit or anya tareekon ke prayog se, jaise maanav janit data ke liye chois modelling sulajhaate hai
 In these situations, the underlying interrelationships can either be controlled, or removed completely, during the construction of the experimental design
 data mining ke liye maanak paribhaashit karne ke liye kuch prayaas hue hai, udhaaharan ke liye 1999 europea cross industry standard process for data mining or 2004 java data mining maanak 
 ye viksit ho rahe maanak hai; in maanakon ke baad ke sanskaran abhi vikaas kii prakriya ke adheen hai
 Free from these standardization efforts, open-source freely available software systems such as rapidminer, Weka, KNIME and r Project have become an informal standard for defining data mining processes
 in pranaaliyon main adhikansh, PMML main model aayaat or niryaat karne main sakasham hai jo data mining model ko prastut karne ke liye ek maanak tarika pradaan karata he taaki inhen alag-alag sankhyikeey anuprayogon ke bich saajha kiya ja sake
 PMML, data mining group, kai data mining companiyon kaa ek swatantra samooh, dwaara viksit ek xmlaxariwa bhashaa he
 PMML version 4

 maanak or introparability kii udyog prerit maang ke alaava, vyavsaayik or shaikshanik gatividhiyon ne bhi vidhiyon or model ke vikaas or parishuddhta ke liye kaaphi yogadan diya he; international jarnal of information technolaji and disizan mekking ke 2008 ke ank main prakashit lekh, ek sahitya surveykshan ke parinaamon ko sankshipt karata he jo is vikaas kii pahchaan or vishleshan karata he
 The major professional organization in this field is the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
 Since 1989 he has organized and published an annual international conference, and since 1999 has published a semiannual academic journal called "SIGKDD Explorations"
 computer data mining par anya vigyaan sammelan main shaamil hai: Knowledge Discovery in Databases was a name coined by Gregory piatetsky-shapiro in 1989 to describe the process of finding interesting, analyzed, useful and innovative data
 is prakriya main kai baarikiyaan hai, lekin mote taur par iske charan hai kachche data ko priprocess karnaa, data ko mine karnaa or parinaamon kii vyakhya karnaa
 Once the purpose of the KDD process is known, a target data set must be collected
 chunki data mining keval aankadon main pehle se hi maujuud pattern ko ujagar kar saktaa he, lakshya data set itnaa bada hona chahie ki isamen ye pattern shaamil hon jabaki yah itnaa sankshipt ho ki ek sweekaarya samay seemaa main isaki mining ho sake
 aankadon ke liye ek aam strot ek datamart yaa data warehouse he
 The target set is then cleared
 safai, shor or laapata data ke saath tippaniyon ko hataa detii he
 Clear data is transformed into a feature vector, one vector per observation
 a feature vector is an abridged version of raw data observation
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek chehre kii shwet or shyaam chhavi jo 100px guna 100px he usamen 10,000 bits kachche aankade shaamil honge
 chhavi main aankh or munh kaa pataa laga kar ise feechar vector main badla ja saktaa he
 By doing this, the data for each vector will be reduced from 10,000 bits to three codes for locales, dramatically reducing the size of the dataset to be mined and thus reducing processing
 The feature selected will depend on what the purpose is; Clearly, the choice of the "right" feature is the basis for successful data mining
 feechar vactor ko do set main vibhajit kiya gaya he, "prashikshan set" or "pareekshan set"
 prashikshan set ko data mining elgorithm ko prashikshit karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, jabaki pareekshan set ko kisi bhi praapt pettern kii sateekta ko satyapit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Data mining typically involves four classes of tasks: data se gyaan kii khoj kaa antim charan he data mining elgoridam dwaara utpann pattern ko satyapit karnaa jo vyapak data set main hote hai
 Not all patterns found by data mining algorithms are necessarily correct
 It is common for data mining algorithms to detect patterns in training sets that are not present in normal data sets, this is called overfitting
 is par kaabo paane ke liye, moolyankan, data ke ek pareekshan set kaa upyog karata he, jisapar data mining elgorithm prashikshit nahin tha
 The Learnt pattern is applied to this test set whose results obtained are compared to the desired result
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek data mining elgorithm jo vaid email ko spam se alag karne kii koshish kar rahaa he vah namoonay imelon ke prashikshan set par prashikshit hoga
 ek baar prashikshit hone ke baad, larnt pattern ko email ke pareekshan set par lagu kiya jayega jisapar ise prashikshit nahin kiya gaya tha, in pattern kii sateekta ko, kitne email ko unhone sahi dhang se vargeekrut kiya he, is baat se mapa ja saktaa he
 Several statistical methods can be used to evaluate the algorithm such as ROC curves
 yadi larnt pattern vaanchit maanakon ko puraa nahin karte, to punarmoolyankan karnaa or priprocessing or data mining ko badalanaa aavashyak he
 If the learned patterns meet the desired standards, then the final process is to interpret those learned patterns and transform them into knowledge
 1960 ke dashak ke prarambh se, kuch mishrit khelon ke liye orikkal kii uplabdhta ke saath, jinhen teblebases bhi kaha jaataa tha, kisi bhi shuruaati vinyas, chote board dots-and-boxes, chote board hex or shatranj main kuch andgames, dots-and-boxes or hex; ke saath data mining ke liye ek nayaa kshetra khul gaya he
 This is the extraction of human useful strategies from these oracles
 maujuuda pattern pahchaan tareekon ke paas safaltaapurvak lagu kiye jane ke liye pruthakkaran kaa aavashyak ucch str nahin
 iske bajaay, acchhee tarah se dizin kii gai samasyaon ke teblebes uttar ke gahan adhyayan ke sangyojan main, teblebases ke saath vyapak prayog or purv kala ke gyaan, arthath purv teblebes gyaan ke saath, kaa prayog vyaavhaarik pattern utpann karne ke liye kiya jaataa he dots-and-boxes aadi main berlekamp or shatranj andgames main jon nan is kaam ko kar rahe pramukh anusandhankartaaon ke udhaaharan hai, haalanki ve teblebes janan main shaamil nahin he
 In customer relationship management applications, data mining can contribute greatly to the bottom line
 ek sambhaavna yaa graahak se betaratib dhang se ek kol centre yaa mail bhej kar sampark karne ke bajaae, ek company apane prayaason ko sambhaavnaaon par kendrit kar sakati he jinke kisi prastaav ke jawaab dene kii ek ucch sambhaavna he
 More sophisticated methods can be used to maximize resource utilization in campaigns to predict which channels and offerings a person is more likely to respond to - across all potential products
 Additionally, sophisticated applications can be used to automate mailing
 data mining se ek baar parinaam nirdhaarit ho jane par, yah "parishkrut anuprayog" swatah hi ek i-mail yaa niyamit mail, donon bhej saktaa he
 Finally, in cases where many people will make a response without a proposal, uplift modeling can be used to determine which ones will have the greatest increase in response when making a proposal
 Data clustering can be used to automatically search for a class or group within a customer data set
 data mining ko apnaane vaale kaarobaar ek vaapasi yaa nivesh dekh sakate hai, lekin ve yah bhi dekhte hai ki bhavishyasuchak modelon kii sankhya teji se bahut badi ho sakati he
 Instead of a model to tell which customer will respond, an industry can create a different model for each region and customer type
 tab pratikriya dene vaale sabhi sabhavit logon ke liye ek prastaav bhejne ke bajaay, vah keval un graahakon ko prastaav bhejnaa chahega jo sambhavit rup se prastaav ko lene vaale hon
 or ant main, vah yah bhi tay karnaa chahega ki koun se graahak ek samay avadhi main laabhadaayak honge or keval unhi logon ke liye prastaav bhejega jinke laabhadaayak hone kii sambhaavna he
 To maintain this volume of models, they need to move towards model version management and automated data mining
 data mining maanav sansaadhan vibhaag ke liye, apane sabase safal karmchaariyon kii visheshtaon kii pahchaan karne main bhi upyogi ho sakate hai
 Information received, such as the university used for education by highly successful employees, can help HR to focus recruitment efforts accordingly
 iske atirikt, ranneetik udhyam prabandhan anuprayog, ek company ko korporate star ke lakshyon ko anudit karne main madad karte hai, jaise laabh or margin share lakshya, parichaalan nirnyon ke andar, jaise utpaadan yojanaayen or kaarybal str
 Another example of data mining, often called market basket analysis, relates to its use in retailing
 yadi ek kapade kii dukaan, graahakon kii kharid ko darj karti he, ek data mining pranali un graahakon ko chihnit kar sakati he jo kapaas kii jagah silk shart ko adhik pasand karte hai
 Although some explanations of relationships may be difficult, it is easy to take advantage of
 yah udhaaharan, lenden aadhaarit data ke bheetar saahchary niyam kii charchaa karata he
 Not all data is transaction based and logical or inexact, rules can also exist within a database
 ek vinirmaan anuprayog main, ek ayatharth niyam yah kah saktaa he ki 73% utpaada jinamein ek vishisht dosha yaa samasya he, unamem agle chah maheene ke bheetar ek dwitiyak samasya bhi penpegi
 Market basket analysis has been used to identify the buying patterns of the alpha consumer
 alpha upabhokta, ve log hai jo ek utpaada ke peeche kii avadharana ke saath jodne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai, phir us utpaada ko apanaate hai or ant main baaki samaaj ke liye pusht karte hai
 Analysis of data collected on these types of users enables companies to predict future purchasing trends and predict supply-demand
 data mining, suchi vipanan udyog main ek atyant prabhavi upkaran he
 Catalogger has a rich history of customer transactions over many years, millions of customers
 data mining upkaran, graahakon ke bich pattern kii pahchaan kar sakate hai or aagaamee meling abhiyaan ke prati pratikriya dene vaale sabase adhik sambhavit graahakon kii pahchaan karne main madad kar saktaa he
 An example of data mining related to an integrated circuit production line is described in the paper "mining IC Test Data to Optimize VLSI Testing

 Miller and Han provide the following list of emerging research topics in this area: america sarkaar ke tahat aatankwaadi kaarykram rokane ke liye purv kii data mining main shaamil hai kul soochna jaagrukta kaarykram, surakshit udaan vishleshan, prasar, vizualizeshan, insite, arth sanvardhan or multistate anti-terrorizam information exange in prograamon ko, america samvidhan ke chauthe sanshodhan kaa ulanghan karne ke vivaad ke kaaran band kar diya gaya, haalanki unke tahat gathit kai kaaryakramon ko vibhinn sanghathanon, yaa vibhinn naamon ke tahat paisa milanaa jari rahaa
 Two possible data mining techniques in the context of combating terrorism are "pattern mining" and "subject based data mining"
 "pattern mining" ek data mining takanic he jisamen data main pehle se maujuud pattern kii khoj shaamil he
 In this context, patterns often mean compatible rules
 sangat niyamon ke khoj ke liye mul prerana, supermarket lenden data ke vishleshan kii ichha se ai, arthath, kharide gaye utpaadon ke maamle main graahak ke vyavhaar kii jaanch
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek sangat niyam "bear => crysps " yah kahata he ki paanch graahakon main se jin chaar ne bear kharida unhone crysps bhi kharida
 In the context of pattern mining as a tool for identifying terrorist activity, the National Research Council provides the following definitions: "pattern-based data mining discovers patterns that may be associated with terrorist activity - these patterns are called oceans of noise May be considered a small sign in
 " pattern mining main nae kshetra shaamil hai jaise ek sangeet soochna punahprapti jahaan asthai or gaiyr asthai, donon domen main dekhe jane vaale pattern shastreey gyaan khoj ke liye talash takanic main aayaat kiye jate hai
 "subject-based data mining" is a data mining technique that involves the discovery of associations between individuals in data
 aatankwaad se ladane ke sandarbh main, rashtriya anusandhan parishad nimnlikhit paribhaasha pradaan karata he: "vishay aadhaarit data mining shuruyaat karne vaale ek vyakti yaa anya tathy kaa upyog karata he jo, anya jaankaree par aadhaarit, ucch upyogita vaala mana jaataa he or lakshya, yah nirdhaarit karnaa hota he ki us shuruyaat karne vaale aankadon se koun se anya vyakti yaa vittiya lenden yaa andolan, aadi, sambandhit hai
 " kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki data mining khud hi naitikta kii drushti se tatasth he
 However, the ways in which data mining can be used may raise questions about confidentiality, legality and morality
 vishesh rup se, data mining sarkaar yaa rashtriya suraksha yaa kanoon pravartan prayojanon ke liye jaise kul soochna jaagrukta kaarykram yaa ADVISE main, vyavsaayik data set ne gopneeyata sambandhit chintaaon ko badhaayaa he
 Data mining requires data creation that can expose information or patterns that may compromise privacy and privacy rules
 aisi ghatana ke hone kaa ek aam tarika he data ekatrikaran ke madhyam se
 data ekatrikaran tab he jab data ekatrit kiya jaataa he, sambhawatah vibhinn sroton se or ek saath rakhaa jaataa he taaki vishleshan kiya ja sake
 yah swatah data mining nahin he, lekin vishleshan ke prayojanon ke liye or ke pehle data kii taiyaari kaa ek parinaam he
 a person's privacy is threatened when the data, once compiled, enables the data miner or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set to identify specific individuals, especially Since when the data were originally anonymous
 yah anushansa kii jaati he ki ek vyakti ko, data ke ekatra karne se pehle nimnlikhit ke bare main avgat karana chahie: Someone can additionally modify the data so that they become anonymous, so that people are not easily identified
 However, even unmarked data sets may contain enough information to identify a person, as happened when reporters inadvertently search many people based on a set of search histories issued by AOL Became capable

 On some occasions, teams choose to use a three guard offense, replacing one forward or center with a third guard
 sabase adhik adla-badali kiya jane vaala posishan he point guard or shooting guard, khaskar yadi donon khilaadiyon ke paas acha netritv or gend ko sanbhaalane kaa kaushal he
 There are two main defensive strategies: zone defense and man-to-man defense
 In zone defense, players who remain in the defense position guard the opponent who is in their zone
 main-tu-main difence main prayek difence khilaadi ek vishisht pratidwandvi ko guard karata he or use karrwai karne se rokane kii koshish karata he
 There is more variety in offensive play, which usually includes planned passes and movement of players without the ball
 The rapid movement of the ball is called by an aggressive player to gain an advantageous position
 ek aakraamak khilaadi kaa apane saathi ko pratidwandvi dwaara guard karne se rokane kaa sahi prayaas, jisamen vah difender ke raste main aise khadaa ho jaataa he ki uskaa saathi uske bagal se cat karata he, screen yaa pick kehalaata he
 The two games are combined in pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then "rolls" away from the pick towards the basket
 screen or cat aakraamak khel main bahut mahatvapurn hai; inase twarit paas or timwork ko badhaava miltaa he, jo safal tokari kaa maarg prashast karata he
 Teams almost always have multiple offensive games planned to ensure that their plans remain unknown
 In court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which game will take place
 basketbaal ke ucch str par, rakshaatmak or aakraamak sanrachana or posishnon par bal diya gaya he; or yahi sab hai, jin par ek coach aam taur par charchaa karne ke liye time-out kaa anurodh karata he
 Shooting is an attempt to earn points by throwing the ball across the basket
 yadhyapi, khilaadiyon or sthitiyon ke saath tareeqe bhinn ho sakate hai, tathaapi sabase aam takanic nimna rup main rekhaankit kii gai he: The player stands with the legs spread equal to shoulder width, facing the basket, bending the knees slightly and keeping the back straight
 khilaadi gend ko pramukh haath kii ungaliyon par sir se thodaa upar rakhata he, jabaki duusare haath se gend ko bagal se sahaara detaa he
 To aim the ball, the player's elbow must be standing in a straight line, keeping the forearm in the direction of the basket
 The ball is thrown while extending the bent knees and straightening the shooting arm; The ball moves with the tips of the fingers, while the wrist completes the full downward movement
 shooting haath ko, puri tarah se failaate hue gend phenkane ke pashchaat ek pal ke liye sthir rakhaa jaataa he, jabaki kalai puri tarah se mudi hoti he or ungliyaan neeche kii ore ishaara karti hai, ise folo thru ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jise sahi dhang se karne se shot kii sateekta badhati he
 Generally, the non-shooting hand is used only to give direction to the shot, not to force it
 aksar khilaadi rim par gend ke prabhaav ko dhimaa karne ke liye, us par ek sthir bahospin daalane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat debatable, but coaches generally recommend a proper arc
 khilaadi sidhe tokari main shot maar sakate hai yaa bechboard kaa upyog karte hue gend ko tokari main pun:preshit kar sakate hai
 The two most common shots using the method described above are the set shot and the jump shot
 The set shot is performed from a standing position, with both feet on the ground and is generally used for free throws
 jamp shot hawa main uchhalte hue kiya jaataa he, jab gend ko chalaang kii sheersh oonchai se phenkaa jaataa he
 This gives more emphasis and expansion and at the same time, allows the player to rise higher than the defender
 pair ke zamin par waapas aane se pehle, gend ko phenkane main vifaltaa yatra-ulanghan maani jaati he
 Another common shot is layup
 This shot requires the player to move toward the basket and "take" the ball "inside" the basket and generally move off the backboard
 Most enjoyable and usually the highest-percentile for the crowd
 The exact shot is the slam sting, in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball down, straight through the circle
 ek or shot jo aam hota ja rahaa he vah he "sarkas shot"
 sarkas shot ek nimna-pratishat shot he, jise shooter dwaara hawa main asantulit rahete hue, neeche aakar tathaa / yaa tokari se dur munh pher kar, jatke se uchhaalate hue yaa ghere main shoot kiya jaataa he
 a shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is called an air ball
 vishesh rup se ek karaab shot, yaa jo sirf bechboard ko hit karata he, use mazaaq ke taur par brick kaha jaataa he
 The purpose of rebounding is to successfully acquire the basketball right after a free throw or field goal is missed, as it flips through the circle or backboard
 yah khel main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaataa he, chunki adhikansh qabje, ek team ke shot chook jane ke baad samaapt ho jate hai
 There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebound, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and the possession does not change, and defensive rebound, in which the defense team retakes the free ball
 adhikansh ribound rakshaatmak hote hai, chunki jo team difence main hoti he, vah chook jane vaale shot ko pun:praapt karne kii behatar sthiti main hoti he
 The method of transporting the ball between players is called a pass
 adhikansh paas dete samay, shakti-vardhan ke liye ek qadam aage badhaaya jaataa he or sateekta sunishchit karne ke liye haathon ko aage badhaate hai
 a major pass is the Chest Pass
 gend, paas karne vaale ke seene se sidhe resiver ke seene par jaati he
 In a proper chest pass, the thumbs flare outward to increase velocity and the defense does not get a chance to react
 paas kaa ek anya prakaar he bouns paas 
 isamen paas dene vaala, gend ko apane seene se resiver ke seene tak laharaa kar bouns karte hue do tihaai duuri tak le jaataa he
 The ball falls on the court and moves towards the receiver
 chest paas kii tulana main bouns paas ko puraa hone main zyaada vaqt lagata he, lekin virdohi team ke liye bich main rokna mushkil bhi hota he 
 is prakaar, khilaadi bheed bhare mauqon par yaa ek difender ko paas karne ke liye, aksar bouns paas kaa upyog karte hai
 Overhead passes are used to pass the ball over a defender
 gend, pasar ke sir ke upar se chodi jaati he
 The outlet pass is made when a team gets a defensive rebound
 ribound ke baad aglaa paas outlet paas hota he
 The important aspect of any good pass is that it is difficult to stop
 achche pasar kaaphi sateekta ke saath gend ko paas karte hai or unhen thik se pataa hota he ki unke prayek saathi ko gend kahaan praapt karnaa pasand he
 a special way of doing this is to pass the ball without seeing the receiving partner
 This is called no look pass
 passing kii ek anya unnat style he bihaind da back paas, jisamen iske naam ke anuroop, pasar dwaara peeche kii ore team ke ek saathi ko gend phenkna shaamil he
 Although some players can make such passes effectively, many coaches do not encourage a no-look or behind the back pass, believing it is difficult to control and more likely to lead to turnovers or violations
 gend ko ek haath se lagaataar oochhaalane kii karrwai ko dribling kehete hai or ek khilaadi ke liye gend ke saath qadam badhaane ke liye, yah ek apeksha he
 To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with fingers instead of hitting it with the palm; This ensures greater control
 jab dribling karte hue ek pratidwandvi ke saamne se guzarate hai to dribler ko apane haathon ko pratidwandvi se adhiktam duuri par rakhte hue drible karnaa chahie, jisase rakshaatmak khilaadi ke liye gend ko paanaa or adhik mushkil ho jaae
 isliye yah ek khilaadi ke liye mahatvapurn he ki vah samarth rup se donon haathon se drible karne main sakasham ho
 Good dribblers bounce the ball less to the ground, reducing the distance the ball travels from hand to ground, making it more difficult for the defender to "steal" the ball
 achche gend sanchaalak badi tivrata se apni peeth ke peeche se, apane pairon ke bich main drible karte hai or achaanak disha badal lete hai, jisase ek abujh dribling paddati banati he jiske khilaaf difend karnaa adhik kathin ho jaataa he
 This is called crossover, which is the most effective way to overtake the defender while dribbling
 ek kushal khilaadi, gend kii sthiti kii khabar rakhane ke liye, drible gati yaa paridhiy drushti ke upyog dwaara, gend ko bina dekhe drible kar saktaa he
 When there is no need to focus on the ball, a player may see teammates or opportunities to score points, as well as avoiding the risk of someone else stealing the ball from him
 jab kisi shot ke prayaas ke baad, ek difender gend chhukar shot ko badalane main safal hota he, to ek block nishpadit hota he
 In almost all versions of the game, it is illegal to touch the ball when the ball is way below its radius; This is known as goaltending
 bechboard ko chhu lene ke baad ek shot ko block karnaa bhi avaidh he, yaa jab gend kaa koi bhi bhaag rim se pratyaksh rup se upar he
 To block a shot, a player has to be able to reach higher than the height from which the shot is missed
 Thus, height may be as an advantage in blocking
 khilaadi jo lambey hai or aam taur par power forward yaa centre posishan par khelte hai, ve guard posishan par khilne vaale kam lambey khilaadiyon kii tulana main adhik block darj karaate hai
 However, with good time-management and sufficiently high vertical jumps, shorter players can also be effective shot blockers
 peshewar str par, adhikansh purush khilaadi 6 feet 3 inch se upar hai or adhikansh mahilaayein 5 feet 7 inch se upar
 gards, jinke liye shaareerik samanvay or gend sanchaalan kaa kaushal mahatvapurn he, aam taur par sabase chote qad ke khilaadi hote hai
 Almost all forwards in the men's pro league are 6 feet 6 inches or longer
 adhikansh centre 6 feet 10 inch se adhik lambey hai
 According to the survey given to all NBA teams, the average height of all NBA players is just under 6 feet 7 inches and the average weight is about 222 pounds
 The players, who are the tallest in the NBA to date, are - Manit Bol and Gheorg Muresan, both were 7 feet 7 inches tall
 vartmaan main sabase lanbaa NBA khilaadi yaao ming he, jo 7 feet 6 inch ooncha he
 The smallest player to play in the NBA to date is Mugsy Bogus, whose length is 5 feet 3 inches
 Other smaller players flourished at the Pro level
 Anthony "spud" Webb was only 5 feet 7 inches tall, but his vertical The jump was 42-inches, giving him significant height at the time of the jump
 NBA main varsh 2006-07 ke sizan ke dauraan sabase chota khilaadi arl boykins he, jisaki oonchai 5 fit 5 inch he
 While younger players are often not good at defense against shooting, they make their way through the crowded areas of the court with great speed and their ability to steal the ball with miniature is their strength
 basketbaal ke bhinn rup, basketbaal ke khel par aadhaarit gatividhiyaan hai, jisamen basketbaal ke aam kaushal or upkaran kaa upyog hota he
 Some variations have only superficial rule-changes, while other forms are different games in which different effects of basketball can be seen
 anya bhinn roopon main bacchon ke khel, pratiyogitaayen yaa gatividhiyaan shaamil hai, jinka uddeshy khilaadiyon ke kaushal ko sudrudh karnaa he
 Apart from the main basketball games, there are many different forms of basketball, including - wheelchair basketball, water basketball, beach basketball, slamball, streetball and unicycle basketball
 An early version of basketball was six-on-six basketball, which played until the late 1950s
 yahaan tak ki ek danki basketbaal bhi he, jo gadhe par khelaa jaataa he, lekin vah sanskaran pashu-adhikaar samoohon ke hamale ke antargat aa gaya
 Games, which use basketball skills and equipment, include - the popular version of the half-court game, which is played in an informal setting without referee or strict rules
 shaayad sabase aam bhinn rup haaf court khel he
 Only one basket is used and the ball is necessarily "cleared" - passed or dribbled off the half-court or three-point line - each time there is a change from one team to another on the right of the ball
 haaf court khel main, kam hridayavahini kshamta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, chunki khilaadiyon ko puure court main aage-peeche bhaagane kii jarurat nahin hoti
haaf court khel main court par prayukt khilaadiyon kii sankhya bhi adhik he, ek mahatvapurn laabh, jab kai khilaadi khelnaa chaahate hon
 There are other basketball games like dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke viklang diggajon dwaara rachit wheelchair basketbaal, shaareerik rup se viklang logon ke liye vishesh rup se dizine kii gai wheelchair par khelaa jaataa he
 The governing body of wheelchair basketball in the world is the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation
 water basketbaal, ek swimming pool main khelaa jaataa he or isamen basketbaal or water polo ke niyamon ko mila diya gaya he
 This modified version of basketball played on beaches was invented by Philip Bryant
 bich basketbaal ek vrittakar court main gol par bina bechboard ke, bina out-of-bounds niyam ke khelaa jaataa he, jahaan gend ko paas yaa 21⁄2 qadam dwaara chalaaya jaataa he, chunki ek naram sataha par dribling lagbhag asambhav he
 Beach basketball has become a very popular and widely played competitive sport
 pandrah vaarshik vishwa championships kaa aayojan kiya ja chukaa he
 Sting hoops are a variant of the game of basketball, played on basketball hoops with a relatively low height rim
 isaki utpatti tab hui, jab slam dank kii lokapriyata badi or ise nichi rim ke saath or parivartit goltending niyamon ke prayog se, dank ke or behatar mauqe banane ke liye viksit kiya gaya
 Slamball is full-contact basketball including trampolines
 net ke aar-paar gend ko khel kar ank arjeet kiye jate hai, jaisaa ki basketbaal main, haalanki ank arjan ke niyamon ko sanshodhit kiya gaya he
 The main difference from parent sport is the court; There are four trampolines on the ground below the padded basketball rim and backboard, prompting players to greater heights for slam dunks
 chaar khilaadi vaale tiimon ke sadasyon ko, niyam bhi kuch shaareerik sampark kii anumati dete hai
 Streetball is a less formal version of basketball, played on playgrounds and gymnasiums around the world
 aksar court kaa keval aadha hissaa prayukt hota he, anyathaa khel ke niyam basketbaal ke bilkul samaan hi hai
 The number of participants in a game or in a run can range from one defender and one individual offense to two full teams with five players
 duniya bhar main streetbal ek bahut lokapriy khel he or sanyukt rajya america ke kuch shaharon ne streetbal kaarykram yojit kiye hai, jaise midnit basketbaal
 kai shahar apane saptahanth lambey streetbal toornament bhi yojit karte hai
 Unicycle basketball is played on a normal basketball court with the same rules as a regulation basketball experiment, for example a player must dribble while riding
 aise kai niyam hai jo unicicle basketbaal ke liye vishisht rup se hai jaise ki gend ko in-bounding karte vaqt ek khilaadi kaa kam se kam ek paanv pedal par hona chahie
unicicle basketbaal aam taur par 24" yaa choti unicicle ke upyog se khelaa jaataa he, tathaa court or khilaadiyon ke paanv ke agle bhaag, donon ko sangrakshit rakhane ke liye plastic pedal kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Popular unicycle basketball games are held in North America
 basketbaal se nikle khelon main, jo aaj pruthak khel hai, nimna shaamil hai: Basketball has been adopted by various social groups and for which they have established their own environments and sometimes their own rules
 basketbaal ke aise saamaajik roopon main shaamil hai: Fantasy basketball was inspired by fantasy baseball
 mul rup se haath se aankadon par nazar rakhte hue khelaa jaataa he, yah 1990 ke dashak ke dauraan internet ke aagaman ke baad lokapriy hua
 Those who play the game are sometimes called general managers, who draft real NBA players and calculate their basketball stats
 yah khel ESPN phantasy sports, nba
com or Yahoo! phantasy sports dwaara lokapriy banaaya gaya
 Other sports websites gave a similar look, keeping the game interesting and having the participants actually own specific players

 vaidyanath mandir, devgarh dwadash jyotirling main ek jyotirling kaa puranakalin mandir he jo bharatvarsh ke rajya jharkhand main atiprasiddh devgarh naamak sthaan par avasthit he
 Being a holy pilgrimage, people also call it Vaidyanath Dham
 jahaan par yah mandir sthit he us sthaan ko "devgarh" arthath devataaon kaa ghar kehete hai
 This place got the name Deoghar due to the location of Baidyanath Jyotirlinga
 yah jyotirling ek siddhapitha he
 It is said that all the wishes of those who come here are fulfilled
 is kaaran is ling ko "kaamana ling" bhi kaha jaataa hai
 The history of the establishment of this linga is that once Rakshasraj Ravana went to the Himalayas to perform austerities for the happiness of Shiva and started cutting his head and offering it to Shivalinga
 ek-ek karke nau sir chadhaane ke baad dasavaan sir bhi kaatane ko hi tha ki shivaji prasann hokar prakat ho gayi
 He turned his head ten times and asked him to ask for a boon
 ravan ne lanka main jaakar us ling ko sthapit karne ke liye use le jane kii ajna maangi
 Shivji gave permission, but with the warning that if he puts it on the road, he will become immovable there
 antatogatva vahi hua
 Ravana walked with Shivalinga, but on coming to a Chitabhoomi on the way, he needed a brief retirement
 ravan us ling ko ek ahir ko thama laghushanka-nivritti karne chalaa gaya
 Here, he felt very heavy from that Ahir and placed it on the ground
 phir kya tha, lautne par ravan puri shakti lagaakar bhi use na ukhaad sakaa or niraash hokar murti par apana angutha gadaakar lanka ko chalaa gaya
 Here the gods of Brahma, Vishnu etc
 came and worshiped that Shivling
 shivaji kaa darshan hote hi sabhi devi devataaon ne shivlinga kii vahiin usee sthaan par pratisthapana kar di or shiv-stuti karte hue waapas swarg ko chale gayi
 According to public opinion and popular belief, this vaidyanath-jyotirlinga is going to give desired results
 devgarh kaa shabdic arth he devi-devataaon kaa nivas sthaan
 The very sacred and grand temple of Baba Bholenath is situated in Deoghar
 har saal sawan ke maheene main sravan mela lagata he jisamen lakhon shraddhalu "bol-bam!" "bol-bam!" kaa jayakaara lagaate hue baba bholenath ke darshan karne aate he
 All these devotees take the holy Ganga water from Sultanganj and take a very hard walk of about hundred kilometers and offer water to Baba
 mandir ke sameep hi ek vishaal talab bhi sthit he
 The main temple of Baba Baidyanath is the oldest, around which many other temples are also built
 baba bholenath kaa mandir maan parvati ji ke mandir se judaa hua he
 The holy journey of Baidyanath Dham begins in the month of Shravan
 sabase pehle tirth yatri sultanganj main ekatra hote hai jahaan ve apane-apane paatro main pavitra gangaajal bharte hai
 After this, they keep Gangajal in their Kanwar and proceed towards Baidyanath Dham and Basukinath
 pavitra jal lekar jate samay is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki vah paatr jisamen jal he, vah kahin bhi bhoomi se na sate
 Vasukinath is known for his Shiva temple
 vaidyanath mandir kii yatra tab tak adhuri maani jaati he jab tak vasukinath main darshan nahin kiye jate

 prayek mandir main bhagwaan shiv kaa ling sthapit he
 Among the 12 Jyotirlingas of India, Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga is located in Deoghar district of Jharkhand
 vishwa ke sabhi shiv mandiron ke sheersh par trishul laga dikhta he magar vaidyanathdham parisar ke shiv, parvati, lakshmi-narayan va anya sabhi mandiron ke sheersh par panchashul lage hai
 It is said that Ravana used to protect his kingdom Lanka from Panchshul
 chunki vaidyanath jyotirling ko lanka le jane ke liye kailash se ravan hi lekar aayaa tha par vidhaataa ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 The condition of taking the Jyotirlinga was that there is no place to keep it in the middle, but with Dev Yoga, Ravana became intolerant to the rapid velocity of small-time and started giving Jyotirlinga the form of the changed shepherd of God
 us charvaahe ne jyotirling ko jameen par rakh diya
 In this way Vaidyanathdham was built on the name of the shepherd
 yahan prativarsh mahashivaratri se 2 dinon purv baba mandir, maan parvati va lakshmi-narayan ke mandiron se panchashul utaare jate hai
 During this time, devotees throng to touch the Panchshul
 jaisaa ki neeche ke chitron main aapako dikhaai padegaa
 Panchshulas at the top of other temples located in the Vaidyanathdham complex are taken off a few days before Mahashivratri
 sabhi panchshulon ko neeche laakar mahashivaratri se ek din purv vishesh rup se unki puja kii jaati he or tab sabhi panchshulon ko mandiron par yatha sthaan sthapit kar diya jaataa he
 During this time the alliance of Baba and Parvati temples is removed
 mahashivaratri ke din nayaa gathbandhan kiya jaataa he
 Crowds of devotees throng to get the red sacred cloth of the alliance
 mahashivaratri ke dauraan bahut-se shraddhalu sultanganj se kaanvar main gangaajal bharkar 105 kilometre paidal chalakar or ‘bol bam’ kaa jaighosh karte hue vaidyanathdham pahunchate hai

 yah parampara paariwaar main bhi spasht he, vinay pitaka ke bahut der se, jo buddha kii prashansa kii ek antim kavita main ullekh karti he ki is sabase achche jeev, sher ne teen pitaakon ko sikhaaya
 However, scholars usually undertake abhidhamma to produce some time around the third century BCE, 100 to 200 years after Buddha's death
 isliye, saat abhimamma kaaryon kaa aamtaur par vidwaanon dwaara daawa kiya jaataa he ki buddha ke shabdon kaa pratinidhitiv na karen, balki shishyon or vidwaanon ke un logon kaa pratinidhitiv na karen
 Rupert Gethin, however, stated that important elements of the Abhidhamma system would probably return in the lifetime of the Buddha
 e ke worder or peter harvey donon ne mataka ke liye shuruaati tithiyon kaa suzav diya jis par abibimmaa kitaaben aadhaarit hai
 Abhidham started as an extension of Sutta, but later developed independent theories
 canan ke aakhri bade vibhaajan ke rup main, abhimamma pitak ke paas ek chacord itihaas tha
 It was not accepted as canonical by the Mahasanghika School and many other schools
 abhyamma pitak ke bheetar ek anya skool main khudaaka nikayaa kaa adhikansh hissaa shaamil tha
 Furthermore, the Pali version of the Abhidhamma is strictly a Theravada collection, and has little in common with the Abhidhamma works recognized by other Buddhist schools
 vibhinn praarambhik vidyalayon ke vibhinn abhimmaa darshanon par siddhant par koi samjhauta nahin he or 'vibhajit buddha dharm' kii avadhi se sambandhit he
 There is no mention of the texts of Abhidhamma Pitaka in the early texts of the Pali canon
 pehali buddha parishad kii kuch reporton main abhimmaa kaa bhi ullekh nahin kiya gaya he, jo vinay ke granthon or paanch nickes yaa chaar aagaama ke astitv kaa ullekh karte hai, haalanki yah dhyaan diya ja saktaa he ki aadarneey pehali parishad main hone se pehle abhyamma main sabase pehle buddha ke paas paarit kiya gaya tha 
 Other accounts include Abhidhamma
 sarvastiv vidhyalay ke abhyarth pitt ke vipareet theravaddi abhimamma pitak main, aupchaarik siddhantankan anupasthit he, or dharmon kii aupchaarik sthiti kaa sawaal ek mahatvapurn mudda bana hua he

 There are differences regarding their emergence period

 King Bhartrihari has also not directed his time in his poetry
 atev dantakthaon, lokgaathaon tathaa anya samagriyon ke aadhaar par inkaa jo jivan-parichay uplabdh he vah is prakaar he : According to tradition, Bhartrihari is considered the forerunner of the promoter of Vikramaswant
 vikramsanwat isvi san se 56 varsh purv prarambh hota he jo vikramaditya ke praudhavastha kaa samay rahaa hoga
 Bhartrihari was the forerunner of Vikramaditya, so his time must have been some other time
 vikramsanwat ke prarambh ke vishay main bhi vidwaanon main matbhed hai
 Some people believe it to begin in AD 78 and some in 544 AD

 Therefore, King Bhartrihari was estimated to have come among us before 550 AD

 In addition to this century, a high-grade grammar book called Syntactic is also famous in his name
 kuch log bhattikavy ke rachayita bhatti se bhi unka aikya maanate hai
 It is said that these were the promoters of Nathpanth's Upapati called Vairagya
 chini yatri itsing ke anusaar inhone buddha dharm grahan kiya tha parantu anya sutron ke anusaar ye advait vedantacharya the
 It is known from the travelogue of Etsing, a Chinese traveler, that a grammarian named Bhartruhari died in 651 AD
 is prakaar inkaa saatvin shatabdi kaa prathit hota he parantu bhartiya puraanon main inke sambandh main ullekh hone se sanket miltaa he ki itsing dwaara varnit bhartruhari koi anya rahe honge
 There is a famous story of Bhrithari Ji which tells how he became a monk
 vah katha neeche di gayi he kintu bhartruhari ke nitishatak ke aarmabhik shloke main isi ko sanket rup main kaha gaya he- He had another queen Anangasena whom the king loved very much
 uskaa raja ke ghode ke charvaahe chandrachud se bhi pyaar tha or senapati se bhi tha
 The commander was to go to the house of Ruplekha, the bridegroom
 raja bhi us rupalekha ke yahan chandrachud kochavaan ke saath buggy main baithkar jate the
 In this way both Chandrachud and Senapati had a love affair with Rani Anangasena and Ruplekha
 yah baat yogi gorakhnath ji ko pataa chali to unhone hi kisi brahman ke saath amarfal bheja
 The king gave that immortal to Queen Anangasena
 rani ne wo amarfal chandrachud ko diya
 When Chandrachud took that Amarfal and when he took King Bharthari to Rupalekha
 tab raja jab madahosh ho gaya tab chandrachud ne uske saath pyaar kar ke wo amarfal rupalekha ko yah kahkar de diya kii wo usko khaayegi to amar ho jaayegi or uskaa chirkaal tak yauvan bana rahegaa
 Ruplekha gave the same fruit to the king that if he eats it then he will become immortal
 wo khud ke jivan se ghrinaa karti thi
 The king became angry after seeing that fruit
 poochne par rupalekha ne chandrachud kaa naam bataaya kii useene usko amarfal diya tha
 When Chandrachud took out the sword and asked the truth, he confessed his relationship with Rani Anangasena and also revealed the difference between the commander
 us din amavasya kii raat thi
 The king proceeded towards Ungasena's residence with a drawn sword, furiously
 angasena ne raja ke krodh se darkar sach maan liya
 But on the same Amavasya night, the queen committed suicide
 sais chandrachud ko desh nikaala diya gaya or senapati ko mrityudand diya gaya
 Now the king was depressed
 pingala ne hi unako akhet ke liye bheja tha
 Then when a soldier was killed during the shooting, his wife sati with his body
 raja soch main pad gaya
 Anagasena was a woman
 ek nari he rupalekha
 And a woman is the wife of that soldier
 kya he nari?? Now comes the pigeon when the queen is ready to die as soon as she hears the false news of the king's death
 jab gorakhnath ji mrit hiran ko jivit kar dete he tab wo rajpaat se bahut oobe hue hote he
 Gorakhnath ji has a condition that if he brings Rani Pingla as a mother, then he will make her his disciple
 rani pigla bahut pativruta thi
 By wearing saffron, Raja Bhrithari comes to the palace and says: - Alakh Niranjan
 mata pingala bhiksham dehi
 The water stream flows out of the eyes of Pingala Rani
 kaaphi vaartalap ke baad rani bhiksha paatr main daal detii he
 After this, Gorakhnath ji takes him with him as a disciple
 inke jivan se sambandhit kuch kinvadantiyaan is prakaar he - Once King Bhartrihari went to the forest to play hunting with his wife Pingala
 vahaan kaaphi samay tak bhatakate rahane ke baad bhi unhen koi shikaar nahin mila
 When the frustrated husband and wife were returning home, they saw a herd of deer on the way
 jiske aage ek mrug chal rahaa tha
 Bhartrihari tried to attack him when Pingala stopped him and requested that Maharaja, this mrigaraja is the husband and follower of 7 hundred deer
 isaliye aap uskaa shikaar na karen
 Bhartrihari did not listen to his wife and killed the deer, causing him to die and fall to the ground
 praan chhodte-chhodte hiran ne raja bhartruhari se kaha- tumne yah thik nahin kiya
 Now follow what i say
 meri mrityu ke baad mere sing shringibaba ko, mere netra chanchal nari ko, meri twachaa sadhu-santon ko, mere pair bhaagane vaale choron ko or mere sharir kii mitti paapi raja ko de do
 Hearing the mercy of the deer, Bhartrihari's heart was moved
 hiran kaa kalevar ghode par lad kar vah maarg main chalane lage
 On the way, he met Baba Gorakhnath
 bhartruhari ne is ghatana se avgat karaate hue unase hiran ko jivit karne kii prarthana kii
 On this Baba Gorakhnath said- i can give life to him on one condition that you will have to become my disciple once it is alive
 raja ne gorakhnath kii baat maan lee
 There are other legends that explain why Bhartrihari took renunciation, describing him as the eldest brother of the king and Vikramaditya
 inke granthon se gyaat hota he ki inhen aisi priytama se niraashaa hui thi jise ye bahut prem karte the
 Even in the early verses of Niti-century, there is a glimpse of disappointed love
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki unhone prem main dhokhaa khaane par vairaygy jivan grahan kar liya tha, jiskaa vivaran is prakaar he
 According to this observation, once a monk came to the court of King Bhartrihari and in reverence to the king gave him an immortal fruit
 is fal ko khaakar raja yaa koi bhi vyakti amar ko saktaa tha
 The king gave this fruit to his beloved queen Pingala to eat, but the queen did not eat it herself and gave it to one of her favorite generals, who was related to politics
 usne bhi fal ko swayan na khaakar use us rajnartiki ko de diya
 Thus this immortal fruit reached the diplomatics
 fal ko paakar us rajnartiki ne ise raja ko dene kaa vichaar kiya
 She arrived at the court and offered the king fruits
 rani pingala ko diya hua fal rajnartiki se paakar raja aashcharyachakit rah gayi tathaa ise uske paas pahunchne kaa vrittant poocha
 The diplomatics briefly revealed everything to the king
 is ghatana kaa raja ke upar atyant gaharaa prabhaav padaa tathaa unhone sansar kii nashvarata ko jaanakar sanyas lene kaa nishchay kar liya or apane chote bhai vikram ko rajya kaa uttaradhikari banaakar van main tapasya karne chale gayi
 His three centuries are the best Sanskrit poetry
 inke anek padya vyaktigat anubhuti se anupranit hai tathaa unamem aatm-darshan kaa tatva purnroopen parilakshith hota he
 It is known from the Bhavishya Purana that the time of King Vikramaditya was of great happiness and prosperity
 us samay unke rajya main jayant naam kaa ek brahman rahata tha
 As a result of severe penance, he received a fruit from Indra, which was the specialty that any person could become immortal after eating it
 fal ko paakar brahman apane ghar chalaa aayaa tathaa use raja bhartruhari ko dene kaa nishchay kiya or unhen de diya
 According to another observation, Bhartrihari was the elder brother of Vikramaditya and the famous emperor of India
 ve malwa kii rajdhani ujjayini main nyaay purvak shashan karte the
 He had a queen whose name is said to be Pingala
 raja usase atyant prem karte the, jabaki vah maharaja se atyant kapatpurna vyavhaar karti thi
 Although his younger brother Vikramaditya had warned King Bhartrihari many times, the king did not pay attention to his activities due to his love trap
 us anushruti ke aadhaar par yah sanket miltaa he ki bhartruhari malwa ke nivasee tathaa vikramaditya ke bade bhai the
 Bhartrihari is the leading poet of the Sanskrit Muktakakavya tradition
 inhen teen shatakon ke kaaran unhen ek safal or uttam kavi mana jaataa he
 His language is simple, captivating, sweet, juicy and fluent
 bhavabhivyakti itani shashakt he ki vah pathak ke hriday or man donon ko prabhavit karti he
 There are variety of verses in his centuries
 bhav or vishay ke anukool chand kaa prayog, vishay ke anurup udhaaharan aadi se unki sukhtiyaan jan-jan main prachlit rahi hai or samay-samay par jivan main maargdarshan or prerana detii rahi hai

 The decision related to the use of profit is the burden of a group of individuals called the governing board

 The decision regarding the distribution of divisible profits among the shareholders is important
 is sambandh main liye gayi nirnay kaa matlab anshadhariyon ko adhik aay, kam aay athwa kuch aay nahin ho saktaa he
 In addition to affecting the current shareholders' stance, the decision to pay dividends can also have an impact on the attitude and behavior of future shareholders, stock exchanges and financial institutions, as dividends are related to the value of the company which is part of the company's shares
 Affects market price

 Managers do not have a choice whether to distribute dividends or not
 haan, yah prashn avashya hota he ki kitna labhaansh baante? iskaa uttar labhaansh niti se miltaa he
 Dividend policy refers to the principles and scheme of distributing dividends
 weston evam brigam ne likhaa he, The policy formulated by the management in relation to the distribution of earnings in the form of dividend among the shareholders is called dividend policy
 keval ek vishesh satr main dey labhaansh se hi iskaa sambandh nahin hota he balki kai varshon tak apanaae jane vaale kadamon se bhi yah sambandh rakhata he
 Before formulating dividend policy, one has to find answers to the following questions - laabh kaa vah bhaag, jise vibhajya laabh kehete hai, jo company ke sadasyon ko praapt hota he, labhaansh kehalaata he
 Divisible profit refers to those profits of the company which can be legally distributed among the shareholders of the company
 company adhinium, 1974 sanshodhit 1975 ke anusaar vibhajya laabh kaa abhipraay company ke shuddh laabh kaa 1 / 3 bhaag yaa company ke sam anshon ke ankit mulya par bhugtan yogya 12 pratishat labhaansh kii raashi va purvadhikaar anshon par dey labhaansh kii raashi se hota he
 To this effect, the net profit is the profit as per the provisions of section 394 of the Companies Act, 1956 and the amount of income tax has been reduced and the depreciation has been reduced as per section 205 of the Companies Act
 labhaansh vastutah kul arjeet aay main se samast vyayon ko ghataane ke baad va vishesh prakaar ke koshon va karon ke liye praavdhaan karne ke baad bache aadhiky kaa hi ek bhaag hota he
 Even shareholders have the right over this excess
 haan purvadhikaar anshon kii dasha main unhen is aadhiky par sam anshadhariyon kii tulana main praathamikta praapt hoti he
 Although even the shareholders have full authority over this excess, the shareholders cannot legally compel the company for its full distribution or for immediate distribution
 labhaansh niti ko nirdhaarit karne vaale tatv nimnlikhit hai :- Dividends can be distributed only from the company's current and last year's profits, so the most important element affecting the dividend policy is the company's profit
 company kaa laabh, labhaansh kii ucchtam seemaa nirdhaarit karne main sahaayak hota he
 In the same way, the companies making profit permanently, distribute more part of the profit in the form of dividend than the companies whose profit is exaggerated
 yadi company ke paas labhaansh kii ghoshnaa ke samay paryaapt nakad uplabdh ho to nakad labhaansh kaa bhugtan uchit rahegaa
 Bonus shares are issued by not paying cash dividends when liquidity position is weak in entities selling on credit terms, so the liquidity position of the company also affects the dividend decision
 vigat varsh kii tulana main achaanak labhaansh dar ekadam badha di jaae to bazaar main satte kii pravriti penpegi
 The company management attempts to keep the dividend rate as stable as possible
 isliye labhaansh ghoshit karte samay sanchaalkon ko vigat varshon kii labhaansh daron ko aadhaar bananaa chaiye
 Shareholders make certain expectations about dividends when purchasing shares, which operators should respect
 vaidhanik drushti se bhi sanchaalak company kii aay ko vibhinn uddeshyon ke liye upyog main laane ke liye swatantra hote hai par anshadhariyon ke vichaaron va aashaaon ko ve bhula nahin sakate, varanaa bhavishya main atirikt puunji ekatra karne main baari kathinaayee aa sakati he
 Older companies may adopt a liberal dividend policy, while newly established companies are required to spend most of their income in development work
 atah ve anshadhariyon ko kam dar se labhaansh dekar shesh aay kaa pratidhaaran kar liya karti he
 The dividend policy also changes with the reliefs, that is, fast-slowing
 mandi ke samay laabh kii maatra ghat jaati he faltah labhaansh dar main kami karne ke liye company baadhya ho jaati he
 If the company has sufficient amount of Dividend Equalization Fund, then yen-can often manages to maintain a reasonable rate of dividend
 teji ke samay to laabh badhane se company jagat main labhaansh dar badhaane kii hode si lag jaati he
 The policies of the government are changed from time to time, which makes it possible to decrease and increase the profits of the company
 sarkaar kii audyogic shram evam prashulk nitiyon kaa labhaansh niti par prabhaav padataa he
 For example, in the present era of liberalization, the control and duties of the company sector are declining
 faltah laabh va labhaansh par dhanatmak prabhaav pad rahaa he
 Sometimes, the government facilitates income tax to companies that have redistributed most of the profits for the purpose of speeding up capital formation
 isi prakaar adhik labhaansh vitarit karne vaali sansthaaon par atirikt kar lagaakar laabhon ke punarviniyog ko protsaahit kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, tax policy has an impact on dividend policy
 kisi bhi loktantric desh main janamat tathaa saarvajanik pratikriyaaon kaa vyapak prabhaav labhaansh niti par padataa he
 Companies paying higher dividends are criticized by the public
 shramik apane vetan or bonus vruddhi kii or upabhokta vastu mulya main kami kii maang karne lagate hai jisase company ko kathor labhaansh niti apnaani padati he
