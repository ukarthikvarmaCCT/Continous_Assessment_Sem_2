 Formalism is a method of literary criticism and literary theory focused on the linguistic structure of a book
 isamen bhashaa ko atyadhik mahatv diya gaya he
 It considers language the basis of the study of the literary text
 yah paath kaa adhyayan uski bhashaa par padane vaale kisi bahari prabhaav par vichaar kiye bagaiyr karata he
 It often ignores cultural values, social influences, or the author's life in literary criticism
 iske bajaay yah granth kii bhashaa ke swaroop, vidha aadi par dhyaan detaa he
 Formalism in literature theory is called a critical method in which the features present in the language of the text are analyzed, analyzed, opened and evaluated
 is paddati main bhashaa kii vyakaran yaa utpatti sambandhi baton ke saath hi chand or alankaar jaisi saahitiyik prayuktiyon par vichaar karnaa bhi shaamil rahata he
 Formalist methodology underpins the importance of the need for literary, cultural or historical or life-related references of the author to critique literature
 kisi bhi kriti ke kathy ke mahatva ko bhi yah siddhant asweekaar karata he
 In fact, formalism emerged in the early twentieth century as a reaction to Romanticism
 svachhndathawadi sahitya siddhant sahityakar or vyaktigat rachanaatmak pratibha ko kendriya mahatv pradaan karata tha
 Rupavism re-established the importance of the text by removing the literary and personal talent
 usne paath ke jariye yah dikhaane kii koshish kii ki kis tarah usamen rup nirmit hue hai jiske kaaran vah rachana mahatvapurn ho gai he
 Formalism began in Russia during the First World War
 iske 2 mukhya centre the- pehla moscow or doosraa saint petersburg
 It started in 1915 in Moscow, and is supposed to start in 1916 the following year in St
 Petersburg
 soviet sangh ke gathan ke pashchaat rupavaadiyon kaa kendra checkoslovakia kii rajdhani praha ban gaya
 There the Rupists combined together to form the Prague Linguistic Circle Organization
 boris icenbam, victor shchlovsky, roman jacobsan, renevelak, jon mukarovsky ityadi rupavaadi lekhak hai
 Later, formalism was divided into two streams - Russian formalism and anglo-american New Review
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke ant se lekar 1970 i
 tak rupvaad america saahitiyik adhyayan kaa ek prabhavi prakaar bana rahaa tha
 This is particularly visible in the literature theories of René Vleck and Austin Warren
 1970 ke dashak ke ant main rupvaad nae sahitya siddhanton dwaara visthapit kar diya gaya
 Some of these new theories had political aims, while some contained the concept that it is hardly possible to separate literary works from their origin and use
 baad main rupvaad ko samaaj nirpeksh hone jaise nakaaratmak sandarbh main virodhiyon ke liye prayukt kiya jane laga
 The new trends in some academic literary criticism point to the possibility that formalism may be rebounded
 rupavaadi saahitiyik aalochana aage chalakar do dhaaraon main viksit hui- Russian formalism is primarily said to be the works of the poetic language study community established in 1916 AD by Boris Eiken Baum, Viktor Shklovsky and Yuri Tanyanov in St
 Petersburg and then Petrograd
 isamen 1914 i
 main roman jacobsan dwaara sthapit da moscow linguistic sarkal ke kaary bhi shaamil kiye jate hai
 Fukodist Vladimir Pope is also often associated with this movement
 iken baum ne 1926 i
 main ”rupavaadi paddati kaa siddhant” sheershak ek niabandh likhaa tha
 It is about to introduce the methodology proposed by the Rupists
 isamen nimnlikhit aadharbhoot vichaaron ko shaamil kiya gaya he– Russian literaryists often rejected cultural values, social influences, or the role of the author's life in literary criticism
 victor shchlovsky ke shuruaati lekhan "kala jiseki ek upkaran" ke mukhya tarkon main is siddhant kaa spasht ullekh dekha ja saktaa he
 Rhetorical research takes the path of study in which students present their writing
 is tareeke main bhashaa ko swami lekhak kaa sthaan miltaa he
 In another method of formalistic research, references are given to readers to read the works
 is tareeke main bhashaa ke bajaay shikshak swami lekhak kii sthiti main hota he
 It is not appropriate to consider Indian customs or ornament communities as similar to the formalistic review movement
 iskaa sabase mukhya kaaran he rupvaad kii ekangi pravriti
 However, the rituals and the Alankara sect have also underlined the importance of composition, composition method or ornamentation
 inhone bhi kavy ke ek tatv jaise reeti yaa alankaar ko kavy kii aatma mana he, kintu inhone anya tatwon kaa bahishkaar nahin kiya he balki anya tatwon ko bhi apane chintan main shaamil karke use purna banane kii cheshtaa kii he
 But in European European orthodox thinking this systemism has been lacking and monotony has been predominant
 rup par atishay jor dene ke kaaran rupvaad kii kaaphi aalochana hui
 Literature and art are subjects of style or composition only
 style ke sandarbh main hi inkaa vivechan vishleshan or moolyankan sambhav he 
 Thus, in the formalist review, the entire attention was focused only on the form, style, or external form, ignoring all other elements of art and literature

 In connection with this temple, it is believed that when Lord Sri Krishna performed the divine Maharasalila with sixteen thousand one hundred and eight gopikas, then the desire of Goddess Lakshmi Devi was also seen in the heart and she reached Belavan, but in it the gopikas Entry of any other person was prohibited
 at: unhen lalita sakhi ne yah kah kar darshan karne se roak diya ki aapkaa aishwarya lila se sambandh he, jabaki vrundavan maadhuryamayilila kaa sthaan he
 Therefore, Lakshmi started worshiping Lord Krishna by turning her face towards Mother Vrindavan
 bhagavan shrikrishna jab maharasalila karke atyant thak gaye tab lakshmi mata ne apni sadi se agni prajvalit kar unke liye khichdi banaai
 Lord Krishna was highly pleased by eating this khichdi
 lakshmi mata ne bhagavan shrikrishna se braj main rahane kii anumati maangi to unhone unhen saharsha anumati pradaan kar di

 The Samaveda is the smallest of the four Vedas in terms of size and all but 69 of its 1875 mantras belong to the Rigveda
 keval 17 mantra atharvaveda or yajurveda ke paye jate hai
 Nevertheless, it has the highest reputation, one of the reasons for this is to say Vedanam Samaveedosmi by Krishna in the Gita

 Of the 1875 mantras in the Samaveda Samhita, 1504 mantras are from the Rigveda itself

 samaveda ko udagithon kaa ras kaha gaya he, chaandogya upanishad main
 The fourteenth episode of the Atharvaveda, Aitareya Brahmana and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, depicts the Samaveda and the Rigveda as a couple of spouses - amo ahm asmi satvam samahamasmi ruk tvam, dyorahamprithvitvan, taviha sambhwah prajayamavahai
 That is, i am the father - am, you are, i am the world, you are the earth
 ham saath bade or prajawale hon
 
 jis prakaar se rugveda ke mantron ko richa kehete hai or yajurveda ke mantron ko yajunshi kehete hai usee prakaar samaveda ke mantron ko saamani kehete hai

 1) Untrained driver - The main reason for road accidents happening in India is that people are given license in most cities, towns and villages without actually passing any exam, the truth is even Sometimes Joe R
T
O
 They are brokers, they tell people that you will not have to go there and we will get everything done, you will be given license at your house, mostly this is happening with women in India, although men are not too far behind in this matter
 , But the Ministry of Transport, Government of India has given a lot of strength to the process of granting licenses, according to the department, unless you go and give your paper yourself and come The trial will also be long, did not you Draving license, but it is within all only the Ministry of documents and offices, the Arktikok in In the office where this entire process takes place, all this work is done only by the RTO
 The soldiers do the same, they give you exams, they do the rest of the process
 If you have gone, then remain idolized and sit here, so here too the responsibility of the government comes out
 2) sharaab -:durghatnaon kaa doosraa sabase bada kaaran sharaab pikar gadee chalaanaa, hamaare desh main zyaadaatar driver sharaab ke nashe main gadee chalaate hai uskaa mukhya kaaran unki choubees ghante kii duty hoti hai, unka maananaa hota hai kii agar ham nasha kar lete hai to hamen neend nahin aegi jo kii bilkul galat hota hai, nasha karne ke baad unka sharir to jagaa hua rahata hai lekin nasha karne ke baad byakti kaa dimag apane aap sho jaataa hai or tabhi hadashe ho jaati hai, isamen bhi sarkaar ne bahut acha niyam bana diya hai, sharaab pikar yaa phir nashe main gadee chalaane vaale byakti ko sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya hai lekin yah sajaa zyaadaatar logon ko milti nahin hai kyuu kii pakaden jane par yah police ko kuch na kuch le dekar nikal jate hai, to yahan par laaparvaahee sarkaar kii nikal kar hi ai
 3) Excess of baggage -: One of the main causes of road accidents in India is that two times three to four times more luggage is loaded inside the vehicle than its capacity, due to which those freight vehicles Tires get ripped and accidents happen that cause damage to both goods and persons, ie both people and money, now the question arises that when everyone knows, why do people do this? Q, motor owners or drivers are ready to take the loss of both their lives and goods, the main reasons for it are as follows: 1) Police - The police of our country are responsible here, because most of the cases are not of guards but of eaters
 The way you work, you have to pay for your car, the road through which the city will pass, every turn, every toll, or wherever the police will find you
 If not sing without means police you will bother some time, To avoid this, people give money to the police and drive the vehicle in overloading to match that money, here too the responsible administration is reducing the handriver's salary - from the very first day i have seen this drivers and motor Since i have tried to understand the world, i have seen only one thing that motor owners feel one thing is that the driver has extra income so he has less salary
 Things, owners are thinking less salary and driver equal undergo load then Extra freight train to offset that by selling Whoa your money, which is born due to the accidents
 Here also the responsible administration is the reduction of the handriver's salary - since the very first day i have tried to understand this drivers and motor world, i have seen only one thing that motor owners feel one thing is that the driver They have extra income, so they are paid less, the owners think that they pay less and the driver then loads the extra goods into the car to make up for it
 Te that sell do's equal their money, which are born because of the accidents
 Here also the responsible administration is the reduction of the handriver's salary - since the very first day i have tried to understand this drivers and motor world, i have seen only one thing that motor owners feel one thing is that the driver They have extra income, so they are paid less, the owners think that they pay less and the driver then loads the extra goods into the car to make up for it
 Te that sell do's equal their money, which are born because of the accidents

 5) Bad roads - One of the major reasons for road accidents in our country is that our roads are overly bad, due to bad roads, i do not mean only potholes on the road, the design of the road is also bad
 It plays an important role in being and the main reason for the deterioration of the roads is the contractual practice, most of the roads in our country or else, every road is not the government, but the people of Rasuk Dar Or they make private companies associated with this department, they get their design approved from the Government of India or they get the design and the contract to build the road and then they start their work
 , They do not mind that the road will run for ten days or fifteen days does not mean that their work is only till they get the money, harakat-ul-jihad-e-islamic yah vishwa kaa ek pramukh aatankwaadi or ugravadi sanghathan hai | This is an important theorem related to electric circuits in electrical technology
 iske anusaar yadi strot kaa impidence niyat ho or lod kii pratibaadha badalane kii swatantrata ho to strot se lod ko adhiktam shakti us dasha main hastaanantarit hogi jab lod kaa impidence strot ke impidence kaa samishra yugal ke baraabar ho
 This is called the maximum power theorem)
 aisa daawa kiya jaataa he ki jaikobi ne sabase pehle iskaa avishkaar kiya
 Maximum efficiency is not achieved in the case of maximum power transfer
 yadi ham dakshata η { \ displaystyle \ eta } ko lod ko praapt shakti evam strot se utpann shakti ke anupaat ke rup main paribhaashit karen to, Consider these three conditions: is prakaar spasht he ki jab adhiktam shakti lod ko hastaanantarit hoti he tab dakshata keval 50% hi he
 Radio, transmission lines and some electronic circuits often require that the impedance of the load be kept equal to the impedance of the source
 isse transmisan line main riflaction kii samasya nahin hota
 In the front diagram, v { \ displaystyle V} from a source with voltage and constant source resistance RS { \ displaystyle r _ { \ mathrm {S}}} to a load with resistance RL { \ displaystyle r _ { \ mathrm {L}}} Electric power is being given
 isse lod main i { \ displaystyle I} dhara pravaahit ho rahi he
 According to Ohm's law, the value of i { \ displaystyle I} will be equal to the number obtained by dividing the source voltage by the total resistance
 lod main vyay hui shakti p l { \ displaystyle P_{ \ mathrm {L} }} dhara ke varg evam lod ke pratirodh ke gunanfalke baraabar hogi
 Now we can find the value of RL { \ displaystyle r _ { \ mathrm {L}}} for which this expression of power takes the maximum value
 iske bajaay r l { \ displaystyle R_{ \ mathrm {L} }} kaa vah maan gyaat karnaa adhik aasaan he jiske liye is vyanjak kaa har nunatam ho
 The same result will be found in both the situations
 r l { \ displaystyle R_{ \ mathrm {L} }} ke saapeksh avkalan karne par, The first derivative must be zero for maximum or minimum
 or In practical circuits RS { \ displaystyle r _ { \ mathrm {S}}} and RL { \ displaystyle r _ { \ mathrm {L}}} are both positive values
 yah jaanane ke liye ki praapt parinaam adhiktam detaa he yaa nunatam, ek baar or avkalan karne par- This is positive for positive values of RS { \ displaystyle r _ { \ mathrm {S}}} and RL { \ displaystyle r _ { \ mathrm {L}}}
 iskaa arth he ki ukt har uparyukt dasha main nunatam hoga; arthath shakti kaa maan mahattam hoga
 This theorem is also true in the case when the source and load impedances are not purely resistive but are reactive in nature

 They got married in Holyrood Palace on 29 July 1565, even when both of them were Catholic and cousins were not allowed to marry
 vivaah ke pashchaat darnle england ke apane ghar se mairi ke paas scotland chale gayi
 But this marriage worried Elizabeth as both Darnley and Mary were descendants of her aunt Margaret and therefore the collective claim of both to the throne of England was more influential and whose children would become strong and prominent contenders for the English throne

 Mary rejected his request and since then their marital relationship has become bitter

 By March 1566, Darnley became involved in a secret conspiracy with the Protestant feudatories rebelling against Mary
 9 march ko, shadyantrakariyon ke ek samooh ne darnle ke saath milakar holirud mahal main ek ratribhoj ke dauraan garbhvatee rani ke saamne hi rizzio kaa katl kar diya

 Bothwell and his first wife Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell, who was the sister of Samantha Huntley, were divorced twelve days earlier

 This marriage had become extremely unpopular among the people
 catholicon ne shaadi ko gaiyr kanoonee mana kyunki wo bothwel ke talaak or protestant rivaajon se hui shaadi ko vaazib nahin maanate the
 Both Protestants and Catholics were not sure that Mary would marry the murderer of her former husband

 As a queen, Mary refused to have the power to prosecute her in any court and to make a personal appearance during the trial in York

 As evidence against Mary, More showed some perfumes called chests or letters
 —ye wo 8 ahastakshrit sandook kii chiththiyaan thim jinke bare main kaha gaya ki mairi ne bothewel ko bheji hai
 They contained two marriage papers, and a 14-line love poem found in a foot-long silver chest equipped with the seal of a King Francis 2
 mairi ne in chitthiyon se anbhigyata jataai or kaha ki unki lekhnee kaa anusaran kar ke vaisaa hi likhnaa koi mushkil kaam nahi he or chitthiyon par unke hastakshar bhi nahin hai isaliye ye jhuthe hai
 These letters were considered very important because they described feelings of self-immolation over the murder of Mary Darnley
 jaanch dal ke adhyaksh norflock ke duk ne in patron ko behad gambhir or bhayankar or naanaa prakaar ke prempurna geeton vaala mana or elizabeth ko unki pratiyaan yah kahte hue bhijwa deen ki agar ye asli hai to mairi doshi hai
 The authenticity of these letters of the Ark has been the subject of controversy among historians
 ab to inke bare main kuch sabit kar paanaa bhi namumkin he
 These letters written in French were probably destroyed by Mary's son in 1584
 kuch bachi hui pratiyaan jinka angreji main anuwaad he bhi wo bhi purna nahin hai
 Other documents examined were copies of the divorce granted to Gordon of Bothwell, which Morey had ordered from Dunbar
 mairi ke jeevani ke lekhak jaise kii, antonia freizer, ellison veir or jon gaai yah nateeja nikaalte hai ki yaa to ye patr puri tarah se nakli the yaa inamen jaanboojh ke kuch aise anuchhed jode gayi the jo mairi ke khilaaf saboot ban sakate the

 However, some sections and epigraphs and some writing styles present in the letters correspond to Mary's style of writing
 sandook ke patron ko 1568 kii sammelan se pehle kabhi jari nahin kiya gaya tha
 However, the Scottish court saw them only in 1567
 mairi ko jabaran apana pad tyaag karne ko kaha gaya or lagbhag ek varsh tak unhen jail main rahanaa padaa
 These letters were never made public to justify the action of sending Mary to jail and denying her the post of queen
 itihaaskaar jeni vormald kaa vishwaas he ki scotishon kaa in chitthiyon ko saarvajanik naa karnaa or 1584 main unhen nasht kar dena is baat kaa sanket he ki inamen mairi ke khilaaf pukhta saboot the jabaki veir sochate hai ki yah ghatnakram darshata he ki scottish samant jo mairi ke virdohi the unhone itnaa samay in chitthiyon ko banane main lagaaya
 However, there are some contemporaries of Mary who saw these letters and believe in the truth of them, such as the Duke of Norfolk, who had a secret plan to marry Mary during the trial, but was told by Elizabeth He refuses this, saying that he does not think of marrying a woman with whom he does not know yet
 jaanchadal ke adhikansh logo ne in chitthiyon kii saamagree ke adhdhayan or unke mairi kii likhaawat se milan ke baad inhen sahi mana
 Elizabeth concluded the investigation as she wished that there was no firm evidence against Mary or her anti-scottish feudatories and nothing was proved

 That is why this investigation was considered as a political scholar

 In this way, Elizabeth managed to maintain a Protestant government, displaying neither friendship nor hostility to the queen there in Scotland

 On 25 October, all the judges, except Mary 1, considered her guilty and sentenced her to death
 iske baavjood elizabeth unhen maut kii sajaa dene se hichak rahi thim
 Despite the pressure from the English Parliament, she was concerned that the death penalty to a queen could trigger a wrong tradition, and the consequences could be grave, especially when the son of Mary and King James of Scotland 6 Catholic Invade England by forming alliances with groups

 Assessments of Mary in the sixteenth century divided between Protestant reformers such as George Buchanan and John Knox, who vilified her mercilessly, and Catholic apologists such as Adam Blackwood, who praised, defended and eulogised her
 After the accession of James i in England, historian William Camden wrote an officially sanctioned biography that drew from original documents
 It condemned Buchanan's work as an invention, and "emphasized Mary's evil fortunes rather than her evil character"
 Differing interpretations persisted into the eighteenth century: William Robertson and David Hume argued that the casket letters were genuine and that Mary was guilty of adultery and murder, while William Tytler argued the reverse
 In the later half of the twentieth century, the work of Antonia Fraser was acclaimed as " that had characterized older biographies, and her contemporaries Gordon Donaldson and Ian B
