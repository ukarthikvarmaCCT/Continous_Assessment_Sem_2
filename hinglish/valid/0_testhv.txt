 Hindi is an indo-aryan language that evolved from the Sanskrit language, and is thus a much simpler version of it
 It is also called "standard Hindi" the language spoken in the northern belt of India
 Standard Hindi is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India
 English language took many word from Hindi Some of them are as:- 1) - Jungle: - and Indian word taken directly as it is pronounced with the same meaning "forest" Both the language share the same meaning 2)- Juggernaut:- which is the name of Lord Krishna as he is worshiped in one of the 4 major Dham named jaggan Nath Puri in India
 It was taken with a different meaning a slightly different meaning
 First was a force which could ruin anything or ravage, devastate anything that comes in it's way
 Second meaning is a Blind devotion that needs cruel sacrifices in any form
 3) -bangalore: - To fire a worker because his or her job is getting outsourced to an offshore company overseas
 It's a City in India by the name Banglore, which was taken verbatim as a verb
 This city has most numbers of IT engineers and it started outsourcing American IT jobs
 4)-trignometry:- This is an argument that This word is taken from Indian word trikonmiti that stands for trignometry and is an ancient word found in sthapatya upveda one of the oldest books written in the world

 But it might have migrated in other languages to move in English 5) - Bandana: - It comes from Indian word Bandhna that means to tie anything; a verb
 6)- shampoo:- There is a Hindi verb chumpi which means a head massage with oil, a proper treatment of hypertension
 It results in a noun Chumpoo the one who gets such a message or as in a derogatory term one who used excessive oil on hairs or is fond of his hair

 7) - Sentry: - In Hindi as in Sanskrit Santri is prime minister of any state, one who is subordinate only to king and no one else, one who is advisory of the king and plans action of the state
 That word is called to derive the word sentry meaning a guard, especially a soldier posted at a given spot to prevent the passage of unauthorized persons
 8)- Aryan:- is derived from the Sanskrit ‘arya’
 It is also present in Latin and Greek, but is believed to ultimately root from Sanskrit
 In the 18th century in Sanskrit, the word meant ‘speaker of the North Indian language’
 In the 1830s Aryan was expanded to mean ‘speaker of indo-european languages’ since it was discovered that Iranians also used the same word for the same meaning
 In Nazi Germany, the main meaning of Aryan was considered to be ‘non-jewish’ and Aryans were recognized by features such as blonde hair and blue eyes
 Hindu religion today is only the leftover of the most ancient civilization of the world, note the word the most, Aryan
 Even Swami vivekanand didn't want that religion to die uselessly therefore he founded an organisation called Arya Samaj

 After the untimely demise of his father Maharaja Bishan Singh, on 25 January 1700, he sat on the throne of Amber at the age of almost 11 years of childhood
 aurangzeb ne unhen 'savai' kii oopaadhi di thi - jiskaa pratikatmak-arth yahi he ki ve apane samakalinon se 'savaya' the
 It is heard that when young Sawai Jaisingh first appeared in the court of Delhi Emperor Aurangzeb, it is not known why Aurangzeb suddenly grabbed both the hands of Jaisingh and asked "now tell me, what will you do?" At this, Jai Singh smiled directly at the lips and said with a very calm voice, "alampanah! We have a tradition of marriage among Hindus
" var, vadhoo kaa ek haath apane haath main lekar is baat kii pratigya karata he ki vah uskaa haath jindagi bhar nahi chhodega, umr bhar uskaa saath nibaahega! aaj badshaah salaamat khud meraa ek haath nahin, mere donon hi haath jab apane haath main le chuke hai, fir mujhe kis baat kii parvaah?" aurangzeb ko is chaturaai bhare jabaab kii ummid na thi, lekin is budhimattapurna haazirajavaabi se vah bahut prasann hua
 , yadunath sarkaar ne apane jaipur itihaas main is 'oopaadhi' ke bare main jo shabd likhe hai- avikal rup se ye hai-" The new Rajah also gained the title of Sawai, which means 'one and a quarter', because Aurangzeb was so pleased with this youthful prince's feats before Khelna that he cried out," You are more than a man, you are sawa- i
e
,a hundred and twenty five per cent hero' Some other sources state that the title of 'sawai' was not given by Aurangzeb but by Emperor Farrukh Sayar

 Jaisingh II was born Margashirsha Vadi on 7 November 1745, on 3 November 1688 from Raja Vishnusingh's Rathore Queen, Indrakanwar, daughter of Thakur Keshari Singh of Kharwa in Ajmer

 The news of Bishan Singh's death in Kabul reached the royal camp of Maharashtra on 18 February 1700, usually one and a half months after his death, then two days later, the emperor Aurangzeb changed the name of his eldest son from Vijay Singh to Jai Singh, Accepted the heir to the throne of Amer
 badshaah ne jaisingh ke chote bhai cheema ji kaa naam vijaisingh rakhaa
 According to Yadunath Sarkar "


 Jai Singh remained in Amer since his return from the south in July 1698, when the emperor also sent a number of 'strict calls' to attend him
 From his father's time, the delhi-emperor
 They wanted to call them in the south to take their military service
 parantu raja vishnusingh apane putr ko dakshin main nahin bhejnaa chaahate the
 But in 1698, he went to Maharashtra on the pressure of the emperor
 aath maheene mogul shivi main rah kar ye vaapis apni rajdhani amer laut aaye
 Immediately after sitting on the throne, as noted above, he was called in November 1700 to fight with his army in the south as an army of Mughal emperors, but somehow Jaising continued to evade

 He was appointed as his military aide for the protection of Panhala near Aurangzeb's grandson Shah Bidarbakht when he reached the south in October 1701, battling difficult routes and rain-blocked routes
 aurangzeb ke pote shah bidarbakht ke netritv main baadashahi sena ne 11 may i0 1702 ko khilanaa ke kile par baari hamalaa kiya
 In this Amer and Mughal combined forces suffered a lot of casualties, but by breaking its walls, the first Kachwaha army of Jai Singh entered the Blossom-fort

 khilanaa-yuddh main inkaa vir or bharosemand dewan buddhasingh maaraa gaya
 On this blossom-conquest, King Aurangzeb raised his mansab to 2000, first after the request of Shah Bidarbakht
 badshaah kii chah saal kii 'kathin seva' kaa mahaz yah pratidaan jaisingh ko mila! iske baad jab shahjada bidarbakht malwe kaa soobedaar hua, tab usne jaisingh kii sevaaon kaa sammaan karte un ko vahaan kaa naayab soobedaar bana diya, jise aurangzeb ne tatkaal hi 'naamanzoor' kar diya tathaa ek farmaan likhaa ki ainda kisi hindu bhi ko maamuli faujadaar tak bhi nahin banaaya jaae

Meanwhile, in AD 1704, two Badshahi Faujdars took local help and snatched the fief from Thakur Kushal Singh Rajawat to the Jhilaiya hideout located in Sawai Madhopur on 13 November 1704

 Sawai Jaisingh's political stature was reduced to a modest 'mansabdar'
 badshaah iske baad ajmer hokar dakshin ke liye apane bhai kambaksh se muqabla karne ko badha
 Both the kings of Amber and Jodhpur went with him to the area of mandleshwar

 The nerds attacked him suddenly with guns and arrows
 usamen sab mogul faujadaar maare gayi tathaa mughalon kii jiti hui baaji haath se nikal gai
 Then Jai Singh wrote a letter against the emperor to Durgadas that "speak to Udaipur Maharana 


 Rajputs should do what the pride of 'hindustan' should do against the Mughals, including the Marathas
 " When Emperor Bahadur Shah returned from the south, he considered it necessary to somehow compromise both the Jodhpur and Amer kings
 inhen laane ke liye usne budhsingh haada raja bundi ko bheja, jinke marfat 21 june i0 1710 ko ye ajmer ke paas badshaah ke saamne hajir hue
 The emperor returned the seized states to them and also gave the mansab of 4000 and 4000 riders to these two
 us samay tak bhi rajputon kaa mughalon par bilkul vishwaas nahin tha, isliye jab savai jaisingh ajmer main badshaah ke shivi main gayi tab ajmer ke tamaam pahaad tathaa ghaatiyaan rajput-sainikon se bhari hui thim
 He never had full faith in Bahadur Shah's intention even after Mansab grew and returned to the area
 jaisingh ke bhai vijaisingh ke saath bhi kuch aisa hua ki niraash hokar ant main mughal darbar chhod kar hindun aa gaye
 Jai Singh was still an armed rebellion threat from brother Vijay Singh

 He also gave the mansab of 7000 castes and 7000 riders to both, but this time they decided to stay away from Aurangzeb's sons in the mutual struggle between the Mughal heirs

 The reason for this was - the Nizam and Qamruddin were in high positions in the empire at that time and they could be suspected to be responsible for Nadirshah's attack, but the Emperor kept believing in them and kept giving them necessary advice

 Ancient Nyayasutras first ten sutras in Sanskrit
jpg Akshapada, the author of the Nyasutra
 prakhyat nyaysutron ke nirmaataa kaa naam padmapurana, skandapurana tathaa vishwanath kii nyaayavritti main maharishi gotam yaa tehraaya gaya he
 In contrast, Akshapad has been considered the author of these sutras in famous jurisprudential texts like Nyayabhayasya, Nyayavartika, Tatparyatika and Nyayamanjari
 mahakavi bhaas ke anusaar nyaayashastra ke rachayita kaa naam medhatithi he 
 a sentence of these different opinions can be proved
 mahabharat ke anusaar gautam medhatithi do vibhinn vyakti na hokar ek hi vyakti hai 
 Gautama is clearly a genealogical figure and medithi is a personal noun
 akshapaad kaa shabdaarth he - 'pairon main ankhwala'
 As a result, many stories have been devised to prove the meaning of this name, which are completely fictitious, baseless and proof zero
 naiyayik gautam ke bare main anek vidwaanon ne likhaa he
 Mahamahopadhyay Pt
 Harprasad Shastri states that Gautama, based on the translation of ancient Indian texts, composed in Chinese, preceded the Buddha, but the Nyasutra in his name is a second-century composition of Jesus
 satishchandra vidhyabhushan kaa mat he ki gautamiya dharmasutra tathaa nyayasutra kaa karta ek hi gautamanamdhari vyakti rahaa hoga
 They must have been contemporaries of Buddha and their time may have been 6th century BC
 parantu vidhyabhushan yah bhi maanate hai ki is gautam ne nyayasutra ke keval pehle adhyay kii rachana kii hogi
 The subsequent four chapters would have been written by someone else much later
 pro
 yakobi ke anusaar nyayasutra shoonyavad ke nagarjun dwaara pratishthapit ho jane ke baad or vigyaanavaad ke vikaas ke pehle likhaa gaya hoga kyonki isamen shoonyavad kaa to khandan he par vigyaanavaad kaa khandan nahin miltaa
 But Prof
 According to Sherwatsky, science has also been pointed out in the Nyasutra
 at: yah 500 i
 ke baad kii rachana hogi
 But Sherwatsky's view is confusing because of not understanding the Jurisprudence
 tarksangrah ke sampadak aathle tathaa boads ke anusaar gautam ke nyayasutra kanad se pehle ke hai
 Shabaraswamy quotes from Upvarsha which seems to suggest that Upvarsha was familiar with justice
 yadi yah upavarsh mahapadam nand ke mantri hi hai to gautam ko 400 i
pus
 kaa maananaa hi padegaa
 Pro
 According to Suali, these sutras date back to 300-350 AD
 richard garvey ke anusaar aastik darshanon main nyaay sabase baad kaa he kyonki isvi san ke aarambh ke pehle iskaa kahin koi ullekh nahin miltaa
 So these sutras must have been written between 100-300 AD
 in maton main koun sa sahi he yah kahana vartmaan sthiti main nitant asambhav he
 The composition of the Nyasutras and the period of Gautama should have different views on these two questions
 jahaan tak nyaysutron kaa prashn he, nishchay hi ye sutara buddhadarshan kaa vikaas ho jane par likhe gaye hai
 It can be said even more that amendments and additions have been made in this judicial from time to time
 paratu gautam kaa naam in sutron se isaliye sambandhit nahin he ki ye saare sutara apane vartmaan rup main gautam dwaara hi virachit hai
 We can only call Gautama the originator of jurisprudence, not the author of the sutras
 ho saktaa he, gautam ne kuch sutara likhe hon, par ve sutara anya sutron main itane ghulmil gaye hai ki unako alag nikaalnaa hamaare liye asambhav he
 From these points of view we find Vidyabhushan's opinion more valid
 gautam ko akshapaad bhi kehete hai
 Vidyabhushan considers Gautam as separate from Akshpad
 nyayasutra ke bhashyakaar tathaa anya vyaakhyaataaon ne akshapaad or gautam ko ek mana he
 The word 'akshapad' means 'one who has eyes in his feet'
 vyakaran mahabhashya gautam ke siddhanton se parichit he
 The Nyasutras have five chapters and this is the basic foundation of the Nyaya Darshan
 inaki samiksha se pataa chalata he ki nyaayadarshan aarambh main aadhyatm pradhan tha arthath aatma ke swaroop kaa yatharth nirnay karnaa hi iskaa uddeshy tha
 It used to take the support of logic and logic, but its main purpose was to introduce the nature of the soul through these means
 us yug kaa siddhant tha ki jo prakriya aatmatatv kaa gyaan praapt kara sakati he vahi thik tathaa maanya he
 It does not validate the distribution: parantu aage chalakar nyaay darshan main us tark pranali kii visheshtah udbhaavna kii gai jiske dwaara anatma se aatma kaa pruthak rup bhalee-bhanti samajha ja saktaa he or jisamen vaad, jalp, vitanda, chal, jati aadi sadhano kaa prayog hota he
 The creators of these rational jurisdictions appear to be Akshadapada
 vartmaan nyaysutron main donon yugon ke chintanon kii uplabdhi kaa spasht nirdesh he
 Gautama Medhatithi is the original author of the Nyayadarshan and the revisionist-akshapad of the original treatise by incorporating Sanskrit-new themes towards it
 ayurveda kaa prakhyat granth charakasamhita bhi isi sanskaar paddati kaa parinat adarsh he
 Maharshi Agnivesh is the originator of the original book, but is considered as the antidote Charak
 nyayasutra bhi isi prakaar akshapaad dwaara pratisanskrit granth he
 Gautama is the originator of jurisprudence
 pramaanon ke aadhaar par arth kii pariksha karnaa 'nyaay' kehalaata he, at: yah mukhyat: pramanshastra he
 The theorem is also considered in this philosophy but it has become secondary
 gyaan kya he, kaise utpann hota he, uski utpatti ke kitne strot hai, un stroton ke dosha koun koun se hai, inkaa vivechan nyaay kaa vishay he
 The word 'justice' in Indian tradition is synonymous with English logic or logic
 baudhon tathaa jainon ne bhi apni tarkpaddati chalaai he or unhen bhi buddhanyay tathaa jainanyaay kaha jaataa he
 But where only the word justice has been used, 'justice' implies only the principles propounded by the sect
 is sampradaay kaa mul granth nyayasutra he jisamen paanch adhyay hai tathaa prayek adhyay do ahnikon main vibhajit he
 The number of all sources is 530
 pratham adhyay main saamanyat: un 16 vishyon kaa varnan kiya gaya he jinka vistrut pratipaadan baad ke chaar adhyyon main hua he
 The second chapter discusses skepticism and evidence
 tisare adhyay ke pratipaadya vishay hai aatma, sharir, indriya, indriyon ke vishay, gyaan tathaa man
 The fourth chapter, while discussing the nature of desire, sorrow, tribulation and salvation, also sheds light on the nature of illusions and the relation between ingredients and ingredients
 paanchaven adhyay main jati or nigrahasthaan kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Proof, Theorem, Doubt, Purpose, Parable, Theory, Components, Logic, Judgment, Suit, Jalp, Vitanda, Hetabhasa, Trick, Caste, and Nirgasthana These 16 subjects have been considered in the Jurisprudence to derive from the philosophy of 16 subjects
 pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan or shabd in chaar pramaanon se gyaan utpann hota he
 The seven substances accepted in the Vaishika philosophy become in the theorem
 isiliye parvarti naiyayikon ne nyaay ko vaisheshik ke saath sambhddha kar diya he
 Justice mainly describes the method of debate
 kaise kisi siddhant kaa upasthaapan kiya jaataa he, siddhant ke prati kitne akshep ho sakate hai, unka parihaar kis tarah kiya ja saktaa he, ye hi nyaay ke mukhya pratipaadya hai, kaha jaataa he, ki gautam ne hi sarvapratham anumaan ke paanch avyavonvale vaakya kaa prachlan kiya
 According to the Greek philosopher Aristotle, the inference is concluded in only three sentences
 vidhyabhushan ke anusaar bhartiya nyaay main avyavaatmak vaakya kii kalpana arestu ke prabhaav se utpann hui he
 But Professor Keith maintains that there is no basis for assuming the influence of Greek ideology in the early stages of justice
 gautam kii panchavyav vaakya kii kalpana unke mastishk kii hi upaj he
 Justice has been perhaps the most influential departure of Indian philosophy
 nyaysutron main pratipaadit siddhanton kaa buddha acharya nagarjun ne khandan kiya
 To answer Nagarjuna, Vatsyayan composed a commentary on the Nyasutras
 vatsyayan ke upar buddha naiyayik dinnag dwaara kiye gaye akshepon kaa parihaar karne ke liye udyotkar ne nyaayavarthik likhaa
 Vachhaspati Mishra and Udayan, respectively, composed judiciary on the judiciary and commentary on it
 in granthon ke atirikt nyaayamanjari nyaysutron kii ek swatantra vyakhya he
 Gangeshopadhyay, the promoter of Navyanya, and his followers also wrote several texts following the path shown by Gautama
 nyaayadarshan ne anek bhartiya darshanon ko prabhavit tathaa tarkpaddati kii udbhaavna dekar prerit kiya he
 Justice is one such sect which is still being widely discussed among the pundits
 gautam ishwarwadi the yaa nahin, yah kahana kathin he kyonki unke sutron main ishwar kaa spasht nirdesh kahin nahin he
 Later, the rendering of God became a feature of justice
 mokshavastha main nyaay ke anusaar aatma apane saare gunon se rahit hokar apane shuddh dravya rup main avasthit rahati he
 Beyond the intellect, happiness, sorrow, desire, malice, effort and samskara, when the soul becomes in a state of blissful form of sorrow, it is called liberated
