 The convention sets out the definition, rights and duties of statehood
 Most well-known is article 1, which sets out the four criteria for statehood that have sometimes been recognized as an accurate statement of customary international law: Furthermore, the first sentence of article 3 states explicitly that "the political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states
" This is known as the declarative theory of statehood
 Some have questioned whether these criteria are sufficient, as they allow less-recognized entities like the Republic of China or even entirely non-recognized entities like the Principality of Sealand to claim full status as states
 According to the alternative constitutive theory of statehood, a state exists only insofar as it is recognized by other states
 It should not be confused with the Estrada doctrine
 There have also been attempts to further broaden the convention's definition, although they have gained less support
 Founders of non-territorial micronations generally assert that the requirement in the Montevideo Convention of a defined territory is in some way wrong-headed, for largely unspecified reasons
 Some non-territorial entities, notably the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, are indeed considered subjects of international law, but these do not aspire to statehood
 The states that signed this convention are: Honduras, United States of America, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Mexico, Panama, Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Cuba
 However, as a restatement of customary international law, the Montevideo Convention merely codified existing legal norms and its principles therefore do not apply merely to the signatories, but to all subjects of international law as a whole
 The European Union, in the principal statement of its Badinter Committee, follows the Montevideo Convention in its definition of a state: by having a territory, a population, and a political authority
 The committee also found that the existence of states was a question of fact, while the recognition by other states was purely declaratory and not a determinative factor of statehood
 Switzerland, although not a member of the European Union, adheres to the same principle, stating that "neither a political unit needs to be recognized to become a state, nor does a state have the obligation to recognize another one
 At the same time, neither recognition is enough to create a state, nor does its absence abolish it

 In the case of, many earthquakes originate away from the plate boundary and are related to stresses developed over a wide area of deformation, this deformation is caused by major irregularities in the fault zone
 Northridge bukamp aise hi ek kshetra main andh dabaav gati se sambandhit tha
 Another example is the obliquely concentric plate boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plate where it passes through the northwestern part of the Zagros Mountains

 yah siddhant san francisco ke bukamp ke purna adhyayan tathaa surveykshan ke pashchaat prakaash main aayaa tha
 According to this theory, if any force from below acts on the crust for a long period, then it will bear that force for a certain time and point and after that the rocks will be deformed
 vikruti utpann hone ke baad bhi yadi bal kaary karata rahegaa to chattaane tut jaayengi

 satraap yaa kshatrap pracheen iran ke midi samrajya or hakhaamani samrajya ke praanton ke rajyapalon ko kaha jaataa tha
 The term was also used by the later Sasani and Greek empires
 aadhunik yug main kisi badi shakti ke neeche kaam karne vaale netaa ko kabhi-kabhi anaupchaarik rup se 'satraap' kaha jaataa he
 The area under a satrap was called a satrapi
 'satraap' shabd avastai bhashaa or pracheen farsi bhashaa ke 'kshabarapavan' shabd se aayaa he
 In this word 'khashthra' is similar to the Sanskrit homogeneous word 'kshetra'
 'paavan' shabd kaa arth pracheen farsi main 'raksha karne vaala' hota he, jo sanskrit ke 'paalan' shabd se or 'paavan' shabd donon se miltaa he
 'khatthrapavan' changed over time - 'khatthar' became 'city' and 'holy' became 'ban' or simply 'pa'
 is se yah shabd 'satraap' ke rup main or 'shaharbaan' ke rup main miltaa he, jiskaa sanskrit main 'kshetrapal' barabari kaa shabd hota
 In ancient Persian, a similar title 'shoitharapati' is also found, whose Sanskrit translation 'kshetrapati' is simple and the same title is used for Chhatrapati Shivaji
 'kshatrap' pracheen kaal main faras ke samraaton dwaara prantiy shaskaon ke liye diya hua naam 
 'shakhadrapan' of Hebrew is also used in the same sense
 iskaa arth 'pradesh kaa rakshak' hota he
 Greek writers - Herradotus, Thucydidze, and Xenophon, in the records of the countries of Babylon, Egypt, have interpreted it as a lieutenant governor
 herodotas ke anusaar kurush ke mahaan ne apane samrajya ko anek praanton main vibhakt kiya; darayavush ne unka ek nishchit dhang se sanghathan kiya tathaa apane puure samrajya main 21 kshatrap praanton kaa nirmaan kiya or unka kar bhi nishchit kiya
 The first task of the satraps and satraps was to collect the land of their provinces
 kshatrap is kar main se rajkeey sena, nyaayadhishon tathaa apane vyaktigat vyayon ko nikaalkar avshisht bhaag samraat ko detaa tha
 If the satrap wanted to be a benefactor of the emperor, he would have increased the amount of the emperor's share
 kshatrapon kii or se samraat ke liye koi nishchit rakam nahin bandhi hoti thi
 The State Kayastha used to keep an account of all the income and monitor the monarch's share
 unheen ko samrat kii ore se rajkeey aadesh praapt hua karte the
 Thus, the command given was expected to be obeyed at the earliest
 isamen tanik bhi avrodh vidroh samaj liya jaataa tha
 The satraps were also punished for this
 or turki samrajya kii bhanti unke dand main koi aupchaarikta nahin barti jaati thi
 There used to be a person at a distance of a day's journey for the method of commanding the emperor to the satraps
 ek duusare ke paas, doosraa tisare ke paas, is prakaar kshatrapon tak sandesh pahunchaaya jaataa tha
 The emperors of Persia also had other means to obtain subjugation of satraps
 a commissioner was sent with the patronage of the army to provide or punish according to the atmosphere and necessity
 xenofan ke anusaar yah pratha samrajya ke aarambh se hi chali aa rahi thi or uske samay bhi prachlit thi
 The emperor himself used to visit every territory of the empire every year to supervise the work of the satraps
 yadi vah swayan nahin ja paata to apane kisi pratinidhi ko bhej detaa tha
 In the province of Kshatrapas, on making special efforts for the fertility of the land or the promotion of agriculture, some other provinces would be provided to them, but where this order was not obtained, the state was cut off and merged with other Kshatrapan provinces
 praanton main prashasan ke vidhaan kaa bhaar samrat par hota tha jo apane bhai, kisi kutumbi athwa damaad ko kshatrap niyukt karata tha
 In India, Nahapan kept his son-in-law Ushwadat a satrap
 samrat ke saath bahuda nikat sambandh ke kaaran kshatrapon ke jivan main samrat kii hi bhanti vilasita parilakshith hoti thi
 Even in the court of Kshatrapas, formalities were carried out like an emperor
 samrat kii bhanti hi kshatrapon kaa apana antpur hota tha
 Antapur used to have a sufficient number of cleaves
 rajkeey sena ke atirikt kshatrapon kii vyaktigat sena hua karti thi
 Like the emperors, their palaces also had gardens, pramadavan, etc
 samraaton kii hi bhanti ve bhi varsh ke katipay mahinnon main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par samay vyateet karne ke liye jate the
 The Kshatrapas thus had more state power automatically
 sainya tathaa anya shaktiyon ke adhishthata hone ke atirikt ek or bhi baat thi jiske kaaran kshatrap atyant shaktishaalee ho jate the or unke vidroh karne kii ashanka bani rahati thi
 Sometimes they revolted
 kabhi do yaa adhik kshatrap praanton kaa adhishthata ek hi kshatrap bana diya jaataa tha jise mahakshatrap kehete the
 They had more military power and state power which helped in their rebellion
 iskaa udhaaharan daranvush ke rajyakaal main hi praapt he
 The Aroclies, who were the satraps of both Fijia and Lydia, revolted during the reign of the later rulers, especially in minor Asia, as the revolt of satraps began to increase
 laghu kurush ke kaal se kshatrapon kii is pravriti main nirantar vruddhi hoti gai
 The Kshatrapas sometimes revolted openly and declared themselves independent rulers
 in vidrohi kshatrapon main se bahuton ne kai rajyavanshon kii sthapana kii or baad main bilkul swatantra ho gaye
 In spite of all this, the emperor was successful in obtaining his subjection
 iskaa pramukh kaaran kshatrapon main parsparik kalah or yuddh tha
 Apart from this, due to the excesses of women in the court and the atmosphere of adultery, there was a comfortable loosening in the personality of the satraps
 kshatrap apane ko praanton ke raksharth niyukt nahin samajhate the balki unpar apana aadhipaty samajhate the
 One reason for this was also that the system of astral administration was also partly genetic
 ve kshatrap praanton ke bhoomikar tathaa anya aayon kaa upbhog karte the
 At the time of Xenophon, a satrap of Egypt was also appointed by the people of that region and they used to make arrangements instead
 yahi vyavastha uski mrityu ke pashchaat uski vidhwaa ke liye bhi hoti rahi
 Such a system easily loosened the structure of the empire
 parvarti kaal main kshatrapon ko rajkeey sena ke sanchaalan kaa bhi adhikaar mil gaya tha, visheshkar tab jab vah rajkeey parivaar kaa athwa uskaa koi sambandhi hota tha
 The little man was the satrap of Egypt, Fyzia, and Lydia, but he was also the commander of the entire army in the war
 yahi sthiti farnbesus tathaa anya kshatrapon kii bhi he, kintu iskaa arth yah nahin he ki kshatrap praanton main sainik shashan ho gaya tha
 In fact, the emperor used to appoint both soldiers and officers of the society himself
 magistriton kii niyukti bhi vah swayan karata tha
 The satrap could not interfere with the work of magistrates
 kshatrapeey prashasan kii vyavastha ko sikandar tathaa uske uttaradhikariyon ne bhi apanaaya tha, visheshkar silyuks ke samrajya main yaheen vyavastha thi
 The states of Shakas which were established in India also had a regional state system
 bhartiya kshatrapon ke teen pramukh vansh or ek rajvansh tha- The Kshatrapas of Kapisha, Pushpur and Abhisar are found from the records found there
 maanikyala abhilekh main granvahrayak ke putr kisi kshatrap kaa ullekh miltaa he
 He is said to be the satrap of Kapisha
 83wein varsh ke kabul sangrahalay abhilekh main pushppur ke tiravharn naamak ek kshatrap kaa ullekh he
 The name of Kshatrap Sivasena derives from a copper ring shaped posture obtained from the Abhinarprastha
 punjab ke kshatrap teen vanshon se sambandh rakhte hai - Kshatrapas of Mathura - The first of this dynasty was Rajuvul or Ranjuvul, who probably also ruled the first Sakal
 stencono ne us vansh kaa is prakaar anumaan kiya he: The name of Rajuvul is found in inscriptions and postures
 mora crup abhilekh main use mahakshatrap kaha gaya he
 But in the article on his postures, he has been called 'rajadhiraj'
 rajuvul kaa uttaradhikari shuds tha
 Even in the records, he has been called Mahakshatrap
 inke abhilekhon main diye gaye varshon ko kuch vidvan shaq or kuch vikram samvath main maanate hai
 The means of resolving these differences have not yet been found
 cono ke anusaar kharoshth rajuvul kaa shvasur tathaa palit ke anusaar, dauhitr tha
 On another currency, 'kshatrapas Prakhar Oshtas Artasputras' is found in the Kharoshthi script
 in kshatrapon ke muldesh ke sambandh main vidwaanon main matbhed he
 Sometimes he is said to have come from Palhava, sometimes from the country of doubt
 sambhavat ve shaq the
 Through coming through Persia, he became familiar with and associated with the system of Kshatriya; Apart from these, the currency of two Kshatrapas named Hagan and Hagamash have also been obtained from Mathura
 jo rajuvul vansh ke pashchaat mathura ke shaasha anumaan kiye jate hai
 On some coins the combined names of both are also found, and on some only the Hagamash
 inke pashchaat mathura main do-teen kshatrap or hue jinke naam bhartiya hai
 Perhaps by this time, these foreigners had fully embraced Indianness
 ujjain ke kshatrap - ujjain ke kshatrapon ko 'pashchimi bharat ke kshatrap' ke naam se bhi pukaarte he
 These satrapes appear to be of two lineages
 pehla vansh bhumak or nahpaan kaa tha tathaa doosraa chashton kaa
 Bhupak's successor Nahapan is not only traced to his silver and copper beads but also from the records of his son-in-law Ushavadat
 nahpaan ne pashchimi bharat ke kuch bhaag par bhi rajya kiya tha
 He also conquered some part of the Satavahana kingdom
 iske vansh ko shaharaat kehete he
 Rudradaman i ended the Shehrat dynasty
 girnaar abhilekh main use khakhraat vasanivases karas kaha gaya he
 Among the Kshatrapas of the second dynasty, who ruled in Ujjain, the name of Yasmotik, the father of Kardamak dynasty, comes first
 chashton kaa putr jaydaaman kshatrap tha kintu sambhavat vah pita ke jeevankaal main hi mar gaya or ujjain par chashton tathaa rudradaaman ne sammilit rup se shashan kiya
 In the Junagadh inscription it is said that in connection with Mahakshatrap Rudradamon, he had earned the title of Mahakshatrap
 prathit hota he ki uske vansh kii rajyashri sambhavat gautamiputra satkarni ne chin lee thi or rudradaaman ko mahakshatrap kii oopaadhi punah un pradeshon ko jitkar kerani arjeet kerani padi
 The Junagadh inscription praises his victories and his personality
 rudradaaman pratham kaa uttaradhikari uskaa jyeshtha putr damaghasad hua
 After him, the son of Damaghasad, Jeevadaman and his brother Rudrasinh succeeded him first
 isi rudrasingh ke samay aabhiron ne pashchimi kshatrapon ke rajya kaa kuch bhaag hadap liya tha
 Rudrasinh i was succeeded by his three sons Rudrasen I, Sanghadaman and Damasen
 tadnantar damsen ke teen putr yashodhaman, vijaysen tathaa daamajadashri mahakshatrap hue
 Damjadashri was succeeded by his nephew Rudrasen II
 iske pashchaat uske putr vishwasingh tathaa bhartrudaman hue
 His son Vishwesen became his satrap from the time of Bhartradaman
 bhartrudaman tathaa vishwasingh kaa sambandh mahakshatrap rudradaaman dwitiya se kya tha
 This cannot be said with certainty
 is vansh kaa antim kshatrap rudrasingh tritiy hua jisane lagbhag 388 i
 tak shashan kiya
 Chandragupta II of the Gupta dynasty, Vikramaditya, ended the Kshatrapas of Ujjaini and merged his kingdom with his empire and emulated his coins

 The original bullet used in the gun was a round lead ball smaller than a bore, wrapped in a patch of loosely fitted paper that held the bullet firmly above the powder in the beral

 Therefore, with the old smooth bore brown base and similar military guns, it was easier to load bullets into guns
 duusari ore, mul mazal-loding rifl, jisamen grouves ko rifl karne ke liye goliyaan zyada najdiki se feet kii jaati thi, use lod karnaa zyada mushkil tha, vishesh rup se tab bairal kaa bor pichhali firing se kharaab ho gaya ho
 isi kaaran se, praarambhik riflon kaa upyog sainya uddeshyon ke liye nahin kiya jaataa tha
 The first fifty years of the nineteenth century saw distinct changes in the shape and function of the bullet
 1826 main, ek francisi infentry adhikari, delvigne ne asambaddh kandhon se yukt ek brich kaa avishkaar kiya, jis par ek golakaar goli ko tab tak ghusaaya gaya jab tak yah rifl kii grouves main lod naa ho jaye
 However, Delvigne's method was not correct and it distorted the bullet
 nukili yaa "shanku ke aakaar kii" goliyon kii shrinkhalaa main pehali goli ko 1823 main british sena ke captin jon norton ke dwaara dizin kiya gaya tha
 Norton's bullet had a hollow base which, for rifling the barrel, spread with pressure when firing
 british aayudh board ne ise asweekrut kar diya kyonki golakaar goli kaa upyog pichley 300 saalon se kiya ja rahaa tha
 In 1836, the greener pellet was invented by William Greener, the famous English shotgun maker
 yah norton kii goli se bahut adhik milti julati thi, isamen ek antar yah tha ki iske khokhale aadhaar main ek lakdi kaa plag feet kar diy gaya tha jo rifling ko vistrut karne or pakadaney ke liye aadhaar par adhik nishchit dabaav daalata tha
 The test proved that Greiner's pill was very effective but it was rejected for military use, as it was believed to be very difficult to manufacture due to its two parts
 mulaayam sise kii mini ball ko francisi sena ke ek captain, clade etini mini ne 1847 main jari kiya
 It was almost like a greener pill
 mini ke dwaara dizin kii gayi goli shanku ke akar kii thi iske rear main ek khokhli guha thi, jisamen lakdi ke plag ke bajaay choti lohe kii topi feet kii gayi thi
 When it was fired, that is, the iron cap went into a hollow cave on the rear of the bullet, by which the bullet's sides were spread to strengthen the raffling
 1855 main, british ne apni enfield rifl ke liye mini ball ko apanaaya
 The Mini Ball was first used most during the American Civil War
 mote taur par is yuddh main, 90% hataahaton kii sankhya rifl se fire kii gayi mini balls ke kaaran hui
 Between 1854 and 1857, Sir Joseph Witworth conducted a long series of experiments on the rifle and, among other points, proved the advantages of the short bore and, in particular, the advantages of the longer bullet
 vitworth kii goli is prakaar se banaayi gayi thi ki rifl kii grouves main yantric rup se feet kii ja sake
 vitworth kii goli ko sarkaar ke dwaara kabhi bhi nahin apanaaya gaya, haalanki 1857 or 1866 ke bich match uddeshyon or lakshya abhyaas ke liye inkaa upyog bade paimaane par kiya gaya, jab dhire dhire metford ke dwaara ise pratisthapit kiya gaya

 Metford conducted many experiments on bullets and rifles and invented an important system of light rifling with increasing spiral and a hardened bullet
 iskaa sanyukt parinaam yah hua ki disambar 1888 main lee-metford kii chote bor kii rifl, mark I, ko antat british sena ke dwaara apana liya gaya
 lee-metford was the predecessor of lee-enfield
 rifl kii goli ke itihaas main aglaa mahatvapurn parivartan 1882 main aayaa jab, edward rubin, jo thun main swiss sena prayogshaala ke nideshak the, ne ek tambe ke jacket vaali goli kaa avishkaar kiya-yah ek lambi goli thi jiskaa sise kaa kor ek tambe kii jacket main rakhaa gaya tha
 It was also small bore and was a successor to the 8mm "label bullet" adopted for the smokeless powder ammo of the Mle 1886 label rifle
 tej gati se fire kii gayi sise kii goliyon kii sataha pigal sakati he aisa peeche upasthit garm gaison or bor ke saath gharshan ke kaaran hota he
 Because the melting point of copper is high and the specific heat and hardness values are also high, the muzzle speed increases due to the bullets present in the copper jacket
 vayugatiki main aadhunikeekaran ke kaaran nukili spitzar goli kaa vikaas hua
 By the early twentieth century, most of the world's armies had become infected with Spitzer bullets
 in goliyon ko zyada sateek rup se adhik duuri tak daaga ja saktaa tha or inamen adhik urja hoti thi
 The combination of Spitzer bullets and machine guns greatly increased the lethality of war
 bullate yaa goli kii akruti main sabase aadhunik navinikaran jo hua, vah he naav jaisi poonch, spitzar bullate ke liye ek aadharekhit aadhaar
 High when the air rapidly passes over the end of the bullet, a vacuum is created, which reduces the velocity of the projectile
 aadharekhit naav jaisi poonch kaa dizin, iske antim sire kii sataha par hawa ke pravaah kii anumati detaa he, jisase yah form dreg kam ho jaataa he
 The resulting aerodynamic advantage is currently seen as a favorable shape for rifle technology
 spitzar or naav jaisi poonch vaali goli ke pehle sangyojan ko iske khojakarta ke naam par bel "di" naam diya gaya he, ise francisi label model 1886 rifl ke liye, 1901 main maanak sainya barood ke rup main jari kiya gaya
 Two primary problems have to be resolved in the design of a bullet
 unamem pehle bandook ke bor ke saath ek sil banaayi jaani chahie
 agar ek majboot sil nahin banaayi jaati he, bullate ke nikal jane ke baad pranodak charge se gas li hogi, jo isi dakshata ko kam kar degi
 Bullets should work in the rifling process in such a way that there is no damage to the bore of the gun
 goliyon par ek aisi sataha honi chahie jo bahut zyada gharshan paidaa kiye bina is sil kaa nirmaan kare
 This interaction between the bullet and the bore is called internal ballistics
 goliyon kaa utpaadan unche maanak par kiya janaa chahie, kyonki satahi virupata firing kii sateekta ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 The physics affecting the bullet after it comes out of the barrel is called external ballistics
 udaan bhar rahi ek goli kii vayugatiki ko prabhavit karne vaale kaarak hai goli kii akruti or bandook kii bairal kii rifling ke dwaara utpann ghurnan
 Rotational forces stabilize the bullet aerodynamically and gyroscopically
 goli yaa bullate main kisi bhi prakaar ki asamamiti bade paimaane par radd ho jaati he jab yah spin hoti he
 With smooth bore guns, a spherical shape was favorable because no matter how it was oriented, it presented a flat front
 ye asthir goliyaan anishchit rup se gir jaati thim, yaa avyavasthit rup se aage peeche ludhakne lagati thim or keval madhyam sateekta uplabdh karaati thim, haalaanki vayugathik akruti main sadiyon main bahut kam parivartan aayaa
 Generally, bullet shapes were a compromise between aerodynamics, internal ballistics requirements, and end ballistics requirements
 goli ke dravyaman centre ke liye sthirikaran kii ek or vidhi he aage utani duuri par rahanaa jitna ki vyavhaar main mini ball yaa shatalkock main hota he
 This allows the bullet to fly forward towards the front through aerodynamics
 dekhen terminal prakshepiki or / yaa goli kaa dijin kaise prabhavit karata he iske rokane kii kshamta kaa avlokan karen, kya hota he jab ek goli ek vaastu ko prabhavit karti he
 The result of the impact is determined by the composition and density of the target material, the angle of incidence, and the velocity and physical properties of the bullet itself
 goli ko aamtaur par is prakaar se dizin kiya jaataa he ki yah lakshya ko bhed sake, use viroopit kar sake or / yaa use tod sake
 For a given material and bullet, the hitting velocity is the primary factor that determines the result
 vastav main goli kii kai akritiyaan hai or ye kai prakaar kii hai or unki ek sarini ko kisi bhi reloding menual main praapt kiya ja saktaa he jo bullate mould ko bechati he
 RCBS is one of several manufacturers offering several different designs, starting with a basic round ball
 ek mould ke saath, koi apane gole barood ko relod karne ke liye goliyon ko ghar par bhi bana saktaa he, jahaan sthaneey kanoon is baat kii anumati dete hai
 Hand casting, however, is only time- and cost-effective for solid lead tablets
 cast or jacket se yukt goliyaan bhi vyavsaayik rup se haath ladaan ke liye asankhya nirmaataaon ke dwaara uplabdh karaayi gayi hai or ye sise kii casting goliyon se kahin adhik suvidhajanak hai
 Bullets were manufactured by casting pure lead to guns or black powder loaded from the muzzle
 yah kam gati kii bulats ke liye acchhee tarah se kaam karti thi, jinhen 450 m / s se kam veg par daaga jaataa tha
 For slightly higher speed bullets fired by modern guns, a more hard alloy of lead and tin or typesetter's lead is preferable
 or adhik zyada gati kii goliyon ke liye, jacket yukt bulats kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The common element in all of these is lead, which is used extensively because of its high density and therefore it provides more mass — and thus, produces more kinetic energy for a given volume
 sisa sasta bhi hota he, ise praapt karnaa aasaan he, is par kaam karnaa aasaan he, yah kam taapmaana par pigal jaataa he, inhen sab kaarnon se goliyaan yaa bulats banane main inkaa upyog karnaa aasaan he
 It can also be said that lead is toxic, making it a more dangerous weapon
 saint petersburg kii 1868 kii ghoshnaa main 400 gram se kam vajan ke visphotak projectile ke upyog ko nishiddh kar diya gaya
 The Hague Convention prohibits the use of special types of ammo by uniformed military personnel against uniformed military personnel on the opposing side
 inamen ve projectile shaamil hai jo ek vyaktigat, visheile or expending bullate ke bheetar visphotit hote hai
 In Protocol III of the 1983 Convention on Special Conventional Weapons, relating to the Geneva Conventions, the use of ammo to fire against civilians was prohibited
 in sandhiyon main koi bhi tressor ko nishiddh nahin karti he yaa sainya upkarnon main nishiddh goliyon kii baat karti he

 The term bullet is sometimes used figuratively because of its speed, eg: is lekh kii saamagree sammilit hui he britnica vishwakosh ekadashwein sanskaran se, ek prakaashan, jo ki jan saamaanya hetu pradarshit he
