 The rupay card is meant to promote a payments and settlement platform for card transactions at a low processing fee, making it viable for smaller merchant establishments to accept card payments for even low-value transactions
 This is expected to provide a further fillip to card transactions in the country, thereby reducing the use of currency
 In the 2009–12 vision document, the Reserve Bank of India considered the possibilities of establishing an indigenous card for India
 tadnusaar, rupe card ke liye praayogic taur par laanch karne ke liye enpisiai ko adhikrut kiya gaya

 In his 18-year career, he played in the League of Ireland for the Cobb Ramblers, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United before ending his career with a short stint at Celtic in Scotland
 keen, jo ek haaavee ho jane vaala central-midfilder tha, apni aakraamak or atyant pratispardhi khel kii style ke liye janaa jaataa tha, ek ravaiya jo use 1997 se lekar 2005 main uski vidaai tak manchester united ke captain ke rup main safalataa praapt karne main madadgaar sabit hua
 Keane helped United succeed at the club for more than 12 consecutive years
 apane adhikansh karier main usne antarrashtriya str par khelaa or ireland ganraajya kaa usne chaudaa varshon kii avadhi tak pratinidhitiv kiya, jisamen se adhikansh samay vah captain ke rup main bitaayaa
 1994 ke fifa vishwa cap main vah har game main khelaa, haalanki 2002 vishwa cap se rashtriya coach mik maikaarthi ke saath ek ghatana ke baad use ghar bhej diya gaya tha
 During his first season as Sunderland's manager, he lifted his club from the twenty-third position to the Football League Championship and won the league and got seeded in the Premier League
 Keane's arrival is credited as the catalyst for Sunderland's reform
 2007-08 mausam main sunderland ko nirvaasan se bachaane main vah safal rahaa, lekin taap-flite prabandhak ke rup main apane duusare sijan main sunderland ko nirvaasan kshetra main chhod kar usne padatyag kar diya
 april 2009 main, use ipaswitch toun ke prabandhak ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya
 Keane was born into a worker's family in the Mayfield suburb of Cork
 uske pita, morris, us samay kii aarthik kathinaayeeyon ke kaaran jo bhi kaam miltaa tha kar lete the, jinamein sthaneey bunai company or murphi kii irish stout factory main kiye gaye kaam shaamil hai
 Her family was interested in sports, especially football, and many of her relatives were involved in Rockmount A
F
C
 Including played for several junior clubs in Cork
 uskaa county cork main glanworth kaa nivasee gym o brian naamak ek gaharaa mitra bhi tha jo blakerock ke saath harling khelaa karata tha
 Prior to choosing football as his main sport, Kean began boxing at the age of nine and practiced for years and won all four of his matches in the league of new players
 During this period he was developing as another promising football player at Rockmount and his potential was revealed when he was selected as Player of the Year in his first season
 keen apane bachapan main celtic or totenham hotspur kaa samarthak kaa or apane pasandida khilaadiyon main liyaam brady or glen hodel kaa naam liya karata tha, lekin samay ke bitne ke saath, manchester united kaa bryaan robasan uski naatakeey, baks-se-baks style, jiske liye vah captain marwel ke naam se mashhoor hua tha, ke kaaran uskaa sabase adhik prashansit footbal khilaadi ban gaya
 These same qualities were also plentiful in Keane and he did not even know that he would eventually become Robson's long-term option at Old Trafford
 uske honhaar hone ke baavjood, footbal main bhavishya main karier kaa bananaa anishchit sa laganaa laga
 dublin main ek pariksha ke baad use ireland ke schuli ladakon kii team main se nikaal diya gaya – bhootpurv ireland coach or scout ke dwaara iskaa ek kaaran yah diya gaya ki chaudaa varshiya keen aavashyak str tak pahunchane ke liye bahut chota tha
 Without being disappointed, he started applying for the examinations of English clubs, but everyone refused him
 With the passing of his childhood years, he began to do hand-in-hand work while waiting for his football career to succeed
 In 1989, he finally signed on for semi-professional Irish club Kobh Ramblers after convincing Eddie o'rourke, manager of Rambler's youth team
 Keane was one of the two representatives of the Ramblers in the FAI / FAS scheme inaugurated in Dublin and got his first taste of full-time training through this start
 His rapid development as a promising football player was reflected in the fact that he played for the Ramblers' regular youth team and for the actual first team, which resulted in him playing twice in the same weekend
 irish first divijan ke sakht, bhautik sansar main keen ne apane aap se kahin adhik anbhavi khilaadiyon ke saamne swayan ko sanbhale rakhaa or prashikshan ke prati uskaa samarpan kai logon kii najar main aayaa
 Keane's performance in an important FAI match against Belvedere FC of Dublin caught the attention of Nottingham Forest scout Noel mccabe, who asked him to come to England for a practice
 Keane impressed Forest manager Brian Chloe and his staff, and in the summer of 1990, a £ 47,000 deal with the Cobh Ramblers was signed for Keane
 haalanki ek bade club ke liye hastakshar kar lene ke liye keen prasann tha, phir bhi apane parivaar se lambey samay tak dur rahane ke kaaran shuru main use naatingham main jivan kathin laga or vah cork lautne ke liye club se akasar kuch dinon kii chuttee ke liye poocha karata tha
 Keane expressed his gratitude for Chloe's generosity while heeded her pleas as it helped her to spend her initial hard days at the club
 Keane's first games in the Forest were played in a pre-season tournament in Holland on a team under 21
 harlem ke virudd final main, usne spardhaa ko nishchit karne vaale shootout main jeetne vaali penlti kheli or sheeghra hi vah club kii shreniyon main upar chadh rahaa tha or niyamit rup se rigerv team main khel rahaa tha
 His professional league debut against Liverpool at the start of the 1990–91 season and his performance in it encouraged Chloe to experiment more and more as the season progressed
 antat usne apana pehla peshewar gol shefield united ke viruddh kiya or 1991 tak vah england international ke steve hoj ko visthapit karke apni team main niyamit prarambhk ban chukaa tha
 Keane scored three goals while playing for entry in the 1991 FA Cup final, in which Forest eventually lost to Tottenham Hotspur
 But he made a costly mistake against Crystal Palace in the third round, gifting a goal to the opposing team and they were able to draw the game
 khel ke baad dressing room main lautne par chlo ne gusse main keen ke chehre par ghunsa maar kar use farsh par gira diya
 is ghatana ke baavjood, keen ne apane prabandhak ke viruddh koi durbhaavna man main nahin rakhi or baad main kaha ki prabandhan ke dabaavon ke kaaran use chlo se sahanubhuti he or vah inglish footbal main use mauka dene ke liye uskaa bahut shukraguzaar he
 a year later Keane came on for the Wembley League Cup final with Forrest but remained in the losing team again as his future club Manchester United won 1–0
 keen premier lig ke sheersh ke klbon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne laga tha or 1992 main, blakebern rovers ke manager keni dalaglish ne keen se satr kii samaapti par lankashair club main aane kii sambhaavna ke vishay main baat kii
 foresti ke lig main sangharsh karne or usase nirvasit ho jane kii adhik sambhaavna ko dekhte hue, keen ne uske saath nirvaasan suraksha anuchhed vaale ek naye anubandh ke liye baatcheet kii
 lambey samay tak chali yah vaarta janata main badi charchaa kaa vishay rahi or brian chlo ne keen dwaara maangi gai ucch tankhwaah ke liye use laalchee bachche kii sangya di
 chlo ne kaha, keen philhal footbal main sabase jwalanth sambhaavna he, lekin ham use is club ko diwalia nahin banane denge
 foresti ke prashansakon ne phir bhi keen ko abhiyaan ke ant main uske sangharsh bhare pradarshnon ke kaaran use club kaa satr kaa khilaadi chun kar maaf kar diya
 uske sabase achche prayatnon ke baavjood keen foresti ko nirvaasan se nahin bachaa sakaa or uske anubandh kaa suraksha anuchhed sakriy ho gaya
 Blackburn agreed to pay Kean a £ 4 million fee and soon after that he agreed to a contract with the club
 yah bhi atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim ki keen arsenal ke liye hastakshar karegaa, jo us samay paal davis ke vikalp ke rup main kisi yuva midfilder kii talash main the
 But the day before the papers were signed, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson called Keane and asked if he would prefer to accompany him instead of Blackburn
 He was persuaded to cancel his agreement with Blackburn and within two weeks he signed with Manchester United for £ 3
75 million, a British transfer record at the time
 apni aatmakatha main keen ne naaraaz or cruddh keni dalaglis se uske us samay ke vaartalap kaa byora diya he, jab usne use bataaya ki blakebern ke saath hastakshar kii yojana sthagit ho gayi he
 Despite the large transfer fees, there was no guarantee that Keane would go directly to the first team
 Bryan Robson and Paul Ince had made a strong partnership at the center of the midfield and earned Manchester United their first title since 1967
 lekin robasan ab 36 varsh kaa ho chukaa tha or apane khilaadi karier ke antim charnon main tha, tathaa lagaataar lagi choton ke kaaran 1993-94 ke satr main vah khel nahin sakaa tha
 Keane took full advantage of his success in the team, scoring two goals in his first match against Sheffield United on 18 August 1993 and winning the Manchester Derby three months later, when United reversed a 2–0 loss to Maine
 Road defeated Manchester City 3–2
 He quickly made himself in Alex Ferguson's team and won his first trophy as a professional, with United retaining their Premier League title in May until the end of the season
 do hafton baad, keen ne egge cap final main united ko chelsi par 4-0 se vijayi banaakar club ko uskaa pehla doharaa khitaab dilvaaya or wembli main apane haar kii rekha ko bhi mitaa diya
 The next season was less successful as Blackburn Rovers defeated United for the league title and lost to Everton 1–0 in the FA Cup final
 use manchester yanited ke khilaadi ke rup main pehla laal card crystal pales ke viruddh ek egge cap final main mila, jab usne gareth southget ko pair laga diya or sajaa ke rup main use teen maichon ke liye nilambit kar diya gaya or £5,000 kaa jurmaana kiya gaya
 The incident was the first of eleven red cards collected by Keane in his Unit career and was one of the first signs of his furious behavior that caused chaos in the field
 1995 kaa greeshm united main parivartan kaa samay rahaa, jab ins use chhod kar internenel main chalaa gaya or striker mark hughs chelsi main chalaa gaya tathaa andri canchelkis ko averton ko bech diya gaya
 Young players such as David Beckham, Nikki Butt and Paul Scholes were brought into the squad, leaving Keane as the most experienced player in midfield
 1995-96 ke abhiyaan main dhimi shuruuaat ke baavjood, united ne khitaab ko chunauti dene vaale newcasal united, jisane christmas ke netritv main 12 pointon kii championships badhat hasil kar lee thi, ko khaded kar ek or premier lig khitaab praapt kar liya
 Keane's second double title in three years was confirmed by a record ninth FA Cup victory, with a 1–0 victory over stalwart Liverpool
 agle satr main keen ghutanon kii choton kii shrankhla or baarambaar ke nilambanon ke kaaran team main aata-jaataa rahaa
 borashia dortmund ke viruddh yuiefee champions lig semi-final ke pehle charan main usne k mahangaa pilaa card praapt kiya, jisase use old treford main vaapasi ke charan se nikalnaa padaa
 united in donon charnon main 1-0 se haar gaya lekin isaki bharpai kuch dinon baad hi ek or lig khitaab jeet kar ho gai
 After taking an unexpected break from Eric Cantona, Keane took over the reins as the club's captain but in a ninth Premier League game of the season in 1997, Leeds Unite player alf-inge Holland was injured due to a cruciate muscle injury
 He was deprived of most of the 98
 When Keane was lying on the ground, Holland was staying near him, accusing United's wounded captain of trying to hurt him and pretending to be injured to escape punishment; This was an allegation that led to a bad dispute between the two players after four years
 us baar keen spardhaatmak footbal main nahin lautaa
 jab united arsenal par pai ek 11-pointon kii badhat ko ganvaa kar premier lig ke khitaab main haar rahaa tha to vah maidan ke baahar baitha yah sab dekh rahaa tha
 Keen's absence was cited by many pundits as the main reason for the team's surrender in the league trophy
 Initially, he doubted whether he would ever be able to play again due to the seriousness of his injury, but on time he recuperated and started practicing for a new campaign
 "it was the most emphatic display of selflessness i have seen on a football field
 Pounding over every blade of grass, competing if he would rather die of exhaustion than lose, he inspired all around him
 i felt it was an honour to be associated with such a player
" All fears about Keen's injury diminishing his impact as a player were overcome in the 1998–99 season, when he returned as captain of his team to the FA Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions
 Won the league's incomparable triple title
 is abhiyaan main uske badhiya pradarshnon main se ek tha, champions lig semi final ke duusare charan main juvents ke viruddh uskaa pradarshan, jab usne apni team ko do gol ke nuksaan se baahar nikaal kar 3-2 se jeet dilwaai, yah ek aisa khel tha jise europe bhar main european footbal ke aadhunik yug main kisi footbal ke maidan main sarvottam pradarshnon main se ek mana jaataa he
 He started United's comeback with a goal from the head and constantly pushed the team forward on every occasion
 His performance in Turin has been regarded as his best moment as a football player
 lekin us match ke prarambh main keen ko ek pilaa card mila tha jisase jinedin jiden par ek trip ke baad use final ke baahar kar diya gaya
 In the finals, United defeated Bayem Munich 2–1 at the Nou Camp, but Keane had mixed feelings about that victory due to his suspension
 khel ke pehle apane vichaaron ko yaad karte hue keen ne kaha, haalanki main ek bahadur hone kaa dikhaava kar rahaa tha, yah meraa footbal main sabase bura anubhav tha
 Later that year, Keane scored only one goal in the Intercontinental Cup finals, in which United defeated the Palmiras
 tihare khitaab ke baad ke greeshm main anubandh kii charchaaen pradesh main chai raheen, jisamen italy jane kii afvaahon ke bich keen ne united ke praarambhik £2 million prativarsh ke apher ko thukraa diya
 uski badi hui maangon ko antat 1999-00 ke sijan ke madhya main maan liya gaya or usne united ke saath 2004 tak rahane kaa vaada kar diya
 keen ko is baat par krodh aayaa ki club ke adhikariyon ne sijan tikat ke daamon main vruddhi kaa kaaran uske sanshodhit anubandh ko bataaya or club se maafee maangane ke liye kaha
 anubandh par hastakshar hone ke kuch dinon main hi keen ne champions lig main valentia ke viruddh vijayi gol karke khushi manaai, haalanki spardhaa main united kii ruchi quarter finelon main real madrid dwaara samaapt kar di gai, aanshik rup se duusare charan main keen dwaara kiye gaye ek durbhagyapurna swayan-gol ke kaaran
 united ko aath varshon main chhatvin premier lig khitaab dilwane ke baad satr ke ant main use piene khilaadiyon kaa varsh kaa khilaadi or footbal lekhakon ke sangh kaa varsh kaa footbal khilaadi chunaa gaya
 Keane sparked a controversy in December 2000 when he criticized United's supporters after winning the Champions League victory over Dynamo Kiev in Old Trafford
 She complained about some fans not giving verbal support when Kiev dominated the game and said, "our fans away from home are very good, i can call them fanatical
 But those people at home can get some drinks and maybe Some shrimp take sandwiches and do not know what is happening in the field
 main nahin samajhataa ki old traverd ne vaale logon main se kuch "footbal" bol bhi sakate hai, samajhane kii baat to chhod hi dijiye
" keen kii baat ne england main footbal ke maidaanon main vaataavaran ko badalane ke bare main ek bahes ched di, or 'zinga sandwich brigade' pad ab inglish footbal shabdkosh kaa ek hissaa he, jo aise logon ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he jo footbal ke khelon main jate hai yaa footbal ke prashansak hone kaa daawa karte hai kyonki yah fashneble he na ki isaliye ki unhen khel main koi vaastavik dilchaspee he
 He again made headlines in the 2001 Manchester Derby, a game played by alf-inge Holland
 final siti bajane ke paanch minute pehle use norvei par ek spasht ghutane jitne oonche foul, jise kaiyon ne spasht badale kii karrwai mana tha, ke liye baahar bhej diya gaya
 He was previously suspended by the FA for three games and fined £ 5000, but was further punished after the publication of Kean's autobiography in August 2002, in which he stated that he wanted to hurt Holland
 ghatana ke bare main keen kaa bayaan is prakaar he: i had waited long enough
 maine us par jor se waar kiya
 The ball was right there
 use jhel lo
 or ab kabhi mere saamne khadey hokar nakli choton ke bare main baat mat karnaa
 It was an acknowledgment that the injury was actually a premeditated attack after which the FA had no choice but to accuse Keane of bringing the game into disrepute
 He was subsequently banned for five more games and fined £ 150,000
 vyapak aalochana ke baavjood usne baad main apni aatmakatha main kaha ki use us ghatana par koi pashchaatap nahin he
 "my attitude was to kill him
 It goes as it goes
 usko sahi inaam mila
 usne mujhe pareshaan kiya tha or meraa ravaiya he, ek aankh ke badale ek aankh lenaa
 United finished the 2001–02 season without winning a trophy for the first time in four years
 ghar par, unhen egge cap se midilesbro dwaara chauthe daur main nikaal diya gaya or premier lig main tisare sthaan par rahe, jo 1991 ke baad lig main unka sabase nichalaa sthaan tha
 Nevertheless, he progressed to Europe where United reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League, the most lead since their successful 1999 campaign
 ve antat bear liverkusen ke saath 3-3 kul dra ke baad, keen dwaara united ko 3-2 kii badhat dene ke baavjood, baad ke golon ke aadhaar par nock out hue, or keen ne united ke abhyaas kho dene ke liye uski team ke kuch saathiyon ke sampati par dhyaan ko jimmedaar tehraaya or kaha ki ve khel ko bhul chuke the, us bhukh ko kho chuke the jisane tumhen rolex, kaaren, aaleeshaan makaan dilwaaye the
 Earlier that season, Keane advocated for the public to dismantle the team that had won the triple title, as he believed that teammates playing in United's winning 1999 Champions League final were no longer motivated to work that hard
 agast 2002 main us par fergyusan dwaara £150,000 kaa jurmaana kiya gaya or sunderland ke jesan mactir ko kohni maarane ke liye teen maichon se suspend kar diya gaya or haland ke bare main kaantrovarsial kaments ke liye ise or paanch maichon ke suspension se badha diya gaya
 Keane used this holiday to have an operation of his hip, due to which he had to take painkillers for a year
 shuru ke bhay ki yah chot uske karier ke liye hanikaarak ho sakati he, or uske sarjan dwaara bhavishya main kulha-visthaapan kii aavashyaktaa kii salaah ke baavjood, vah disambar tak united team main laut aayaa
 I'd come to one firm conclusion, which was to stay on the pitch for ninety minutes in every game
 In other words, to curb the reckless, intemperate streak in my nature that led to sendings-off and injuries
 aaparishan ke baad vishram kii avadhi main, keen ne apni baar-baar kii choton or suspenshnon ke kaarnon par vichaar kiya
 She determined that the cause of these problems was her challenges and angry statements that damaged her career
 parinamswaroop, vah maidan main adhik niyantrit ho gaya or anya khilaadiyon ke saath vivaadon or takaraaron se bachane kii koshish karne laga
 kuch prekshkon ne mahasoos kiya ki nayaa roy keen apane khel kii style main parivartan ke kaaran midfield main kam prabhaavshaalee ho gaya tha, jo shaayad uske kuulhe ke aaparishan ke baad kam ho gai chalanshiltaa ke kaaran hua tha
 But, after his return Keane showed the same old strength, and in May 2003, the team got another league title
 saare 2000 ke dashak main, keen ne arsenal ke captain patric viyera ke saath ek swasth spardhaa banaae rakhi
 un donon ke bich sabase khaas ghatana hibari main 2005 main united or arsenal ke bich dushmani ke ek charam kaal kii oonchai par hui
 viyera ko khel ke pehle united ke rakshak gairi nevil ko donon tiimon ke bich pehle hue match main uske dwaara jose antonio reis ko foul karne ke liye gupha main roka, jiske liye keen ne arsenal ke captain ko maukhik rup se lalakaara
 yah ghatana ski sport dwaara sidhe prasaarit kii gai, jisamen keen ko match referi graham pole ko yah kehete hue saaf suna gaya, "us apana munh band rakhane ke liye kaho!" lekin baad main viyera ne kaha ki vishwa cap finelon main apni rashtriya team se baahar aa jane ke baad keen aisi baton par vichaar prakat karne kii koi acchhee sthiti main nahin he
 The referee poll later stated that he should have sent both players out before the match started, although he was under pressure not to do so
 kul milakar keen ke netritv main unaited ne 9 mukhya khitaab jite, jisase vah club ke itihaas main sabase safal captain bana
 keen ne manchester united ke liye apana 50waan gol 5 farvari 2005 ko birmingham shahar ke viruddh ek lig khel main banaaya
 2005 egge cap final main, jisamen united ek penlti shootout main arsenal se haar gaya tha, uski maujuudagi main uskaa saatvaan aisa khel tha, jo us samay inglish footbal main har-samay kaa ricard tha
 Keane also holds the record for the most red card players in English football jointly, and was dismissed a total of 13 times throughout his career
 use inglish khel par uske nihsandeh prabhaav kii manyata ke rup main use 2004 main inglish footbal haal of fame main daakhil kiya gaya or vah fifa 100 main chunaa jane vaala ekmaatr irish khilaadi bana, jo pele dwaara chune gaye mahanatam jivit footbal khilaadiyon kii ek suchi he
 Keane left Manchester United unexpectedly by mutual consent due to a strong challenge from Louis Garcia against Liverpool, during a lengthy absence for the club due to an injury in his last competitive game
 His departure was the climax of growing tensions between Keane and United's managers and players since the club's pre-season training camp in Portugal, in which he debated with Ferguson about the quality of the resort's facilities
 fergyusan ko ek emutivi phone-in ke samay keen kii is sweekruti par or bhi krodh aayaa ki satr kii samaapti par united ke saath uske chaalu anubandh ke khatm hone par "vah or kahin khilne ke liye taiyaar hoga"
 "he was our captain, he was our leader and he left a mark: where we are now is down to him, our dedication comes from the standards he set
" The rules about time-keeping, about getting in a half-hour early, they were his instructions back in the day and those traditions continue
 " emutivi par keen ke ek or pradarshan ne or bhi vivaad ko janm diya jab navambar kii shuruuaat main midilesbro ke haathon ek buree 4-1 haar ke baad usne jon o shiya, alan smith, kiren richardsan or darren flechar ke pradarshnon kii aalochana karne ke avasar kaa laabh uthaaya
 par, sabase kadaa vishleshan usne club dwaara rio ferdinand ke yaadgaar hastakshar ke liye tha
 "just because you get £ 120,000 a week and you play well for 20 minutes against Tottenham, you think you're a superstar
" The statement was deemed highly derogatory by the managers of the United States and was later removed from transmission by the club's TV station
 saakshaatkaar main maujuud logon ke anusaar keen ke vichaar uske apane mandandon ke hisaab se bhi visphotak the
 "happiness is not being afraid
" do hafton baad, fergyusan ke saath ek or takaraar ke baad, keen ne manchester ke saath ek samjhauta kiya jisamen use turant club chhodane kii ijaajat di gai taaki vah ek anya club ke saath ek lambey samay ke anubandh par hastakshar kar sake
 old traverd main uske dwaara vyateet saadhe baarah varshon ke samay ke sammaan main uske liye ek testimonial karne kaa prastaav kiya gaya, tathaa fergyusan or united ke mukhya akjicutive david gil donon ne use bhavishya ke liye shubhakamanaayen vyakt kin

 United later revealed that Keane's Testimonial would take place between United and Celtic on 9 May 2006 at Old Trafford
 The home team won the game 1–0 in which Keane played in his old role as first captain for Celtic and captain of Manchester United for the second half
 69,591 kii bheed england main kisi bhi testimonial match ke liye sabase badi bheed thi
 All proceeds from the match were given to Keane's favorite charity, The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association
 keen kaa celtic karier janvari 2006 main ek kalankit tareeke se hua, jab glasgo jaints scottish cap ke tisare daur main nichle darje ke clide se 2-1 se haar gaye
 Her rubbing style had not diminished markedly after her arrival, as she was seen criticizing some of her new teammates at the time of the match
 keen ne ek maheene baad phalkirk par ek 2-1 scottish premier lig vijay main apana ekmaatr celtic gol kiya
 The following Sunday he retained his place in his first Old Firm derby and led Celtic to victory with a perfect, combative man of the match performance under his leadership
 Celtic then completed the Scottish Premier League title and the double title of the Scottish League Cup, his last honors as a player
 12 june 2006 ko, celtic main aane ke keval chah maheenon baad hi, keen ne chikitsakeey salaah par peshewar footbal se apane avkaash lene kii ghoshnaa kii

 When he was called to his first international-level game in 1991, an under-21 match against Turkey, Keane had a sudden disinterest in the organization and preparation of the Irish team, which he later called Named the joke
 This idea of his remained with the rest of the time he spent with the national team, which led to several clashes with Irish managers
 keen ne irish team ke saath algeria jane ke liye apni anuplabdhi kii ghoshnaa kar di thi, lekin use achraj hua jab manager jaik charlton ne use batalaya ki yadi usne apane desh ke logon ke saath jane se inkaar kiya to vah phir kabhi ireland ke liye nahin khel sakegaa
 is dhamkee ke baavjood keen foresti ke manager brian chlo kii salaah par keen ne ghar par rahanaa hi pasand kiya or use tab khushi hui jab ek saal baad use lansdowne road par ek mitrataa khel ke liye irish squad main bulaayaa gaya
 After playing several times, he began to disguise Charlton's football style, which relied less on player's art and constant pressure and more on playing directly
 sanyukt rajya main hue ek sijan-purv ke toornament ke dauraan donon vyaktiyon ke bich tanaav charamasima par pahunch gaya, jab charlton ne steve stanton ke saath sharaab pikar der se ghar lautne ke liye keen kii ninda kii
 Keane was included in the 1994 FIFA World Cup Ireland squad at the USA and played in every game, including a famous 1-0 victory over the tournament's anticipated winner and eventual second-placed Italy
 nederlands ke haathon duusare daur main khel se baahar ho jane ke baavjood, irish team ke liye toornament ko safal mana gaya or keen ko ireland ke abhiyaan kaa sarvottam khilaadi chunaa gaya
 Keane, however, was not ready to go to post-tournament celebrations and later said, as far as he was concerned, Ireland's World Cup was a disappointment
 vahaan manaane ke liye kuch bhi nahin tha
 We had not earned anything
