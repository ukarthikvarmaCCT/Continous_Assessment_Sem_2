 Judas Iscariot, according to the New Testament of the Bible, was one of the twelve original apostles of Jesus Christ and is best known for betraying Jesus at the behest of the head priest
 greek new testament main juds ko Ιούδας Ισκάριωθ or Ισκαριώτης kaha jaataa he
 "judas", the Greek name for the simple name Judah, elaborates on the story that refers to the return of the payment of thirty pieces of silver
 augustin, jerome or jon kelvin jaise kai lekhakon ne nishkarsh nikaala he ki yah ek spasht truti thi
 However, some modern writers state that there may have been epigraphs of Jeremiah in the minds of the Gospel writers, such as chapters 18 and 19, which refers to a potter's pottery and burial place, and chapter 32 which is a burial place and pottery
 refers to the
 juds ne yishu ko kyon dhokhaa diya iske kai spashtikaran hai
 a common explanation is that Judas betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver
 One of the major weaknesses of Judas was money
 Another possible reason is that Judas hoped that Jesus would overthrow the Roman rule of Israel
 In this case, Judas is a disillusioned disciple who does not betray Jesus for the greed of money but because he loves the country and believes that Jesus failed
 According to Luke 22: 3-6 and John 13:27, Satan entered it and asked him to do so
 gauspel kaa suzav he ki yishu ko pehle hi donon kaa gyaan ho gaya tha or unhone juds vishwasghaat ko hone diya

 Origen was aware of a tradition according to which a large number of disciples betrayed Jesus, but this is not specifically attributed to Judas, and Origen does not consider Judas to be completely corrupt

 John S
 Feinberg argues that if Jesus was aware of the betrayal by Judas, then this betrayal is not an act of free will and therefore should not be punishable
 On the contrary, it has been argued that just because there was already knowledge of betrayal, this does not prevent Judas from exercising his own will
 anya vidwaanon kaa tark he ki juds ne bhagwaan kii ichha kaa paalan kiya he
 The scripture suggests that Judas was ostensibly tied to the fulfillment of God's purposes, YET THAT IS ON HIM, and it would have been better had he not been born
 The difficulty inherent in this proverb is its contradiction - if Judas is not born, the Son of Man apparently does not go "as it is written"
 The result of this apologetic view is that Judas' action is seen as necessary and inevitable, yet deserves condemnation
 irasmus kaa maananaa tha ki juds apana iraadaa badalane ke liye swatantra the, lekin martin luther ne khandan main tark diya ki juds kii ichha adig thi
 John Calvin states that Judas's preoccupation with being a prey was predestined, but writes on the question of Judas' guilt: "


 certainly in Judas's betrayal, it would not be right, because God himself wished that his The son is brought up and he dies, instead of blaming God for the crime, the credit for this redemption was transferred to Judas "
 yah anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki juds kii ninda, jo gauspel ke paath se sambhav dikhti he, vah ho saktaa he vastav main yishu se kiye gaye uske vishwasghaat se nahin upji he, balki us niraashaa se jisane use baad main aatmahatya ke liye uksaaya
 yah sthiti bina apni samasyaon ke nahin he kyonki juds ke aatmahatya karne se pehle hi yishu dwaara vah ninda kaa paatr ban chukaa tha, lekin isse yah virodhabhas zarur khatm hota he ki juds kaa purvanirdhaarit kaary sabhi maanav jati ke moksh or uske patan, donon ko prashast karata he
 Judas's condemnation is not a universal conclusion, and some say that Judas was punished with eternal punishment
 adam clark likhte hai: "usne paap kaa ek jaghanya kaary kiya
 

but he repented and did what he could to recover from his misconduct; He sinned with death, a sin that involves the death of the body; But who can say, 


) that that same kindness could not be represented for the lowly Judas? 


 " adhikansh isai aaj bhi juds ko ek gaddaar maanate hai
 In fact the word Judas is included in many languages as a synonym for betrayal
 kuch vidwaanon is vaikalpik dharna ko apanaaya he ki juds purv-yojit kaidi len-dein main keval vaartakar tha jiske tahat parsparik samjhaute dwaara yishu ko roman adhikariyon ko de diya gaya or kaha ki juds kaa ek "gaddaar" ke rup main baad kaa chithran aitihaasik virupan he
 In his book The Passover Plot, British theologian Hugh J
 Schoenfield argued that Jesus' crucifixion was a biblical prophetic conscious observance and that Judas "betrayed" his master at the hands of the authorities with full knowledge and consent of Jesus
 thealogian aaron sari apni kriti da mani deths of juds iscarriyat main tark dete hai ki juds iscarriyat marken samudaay kaa saahitiyik avishkaar tha
 Since Judas does not appear in the Apocalypse of Paul nor does it appear in the Que Gospel, Sara argues that this language is the reason Pauline Christians, who see no reason to establish an organized church, and one among Peter's followers Reflects the crack
 sari kaa kahana he ki mathew or ljuk-acts main juds kii badanaami peter ke utkarsh se sidhe sambandhit he
 Mark 16:14 and Luke 24:33 say that after his resurrection Jesus appeared to the "eleven"
 Who was missing? After knowing everything, no one would naturally think that he was Judas
 jahiraa taur par nahin, kyonki John 20:24 main hamen maaloom hota he ki vah thomas tha
 Therefore, Judas should be included in the eleven
 Furthermore, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15: 5 that Jesus was seen by the "twelve" after his resurrection
 This should involve Judas because it was only after the ascension, that is, about forty days later, that another person, Matthias, was voted to replace Judas
 
 Another clue that confirms the absence of the Judas legend in early Christian documents appears in Matthew 19:28 and Luke 22: 28-30
 yahaan yishu apane chelon ko bataate hai ki ve "israel ke baarah jatiyon kaa faisla karne ke liye baarah singhaasana par baithenge
" juds ke liye koi apwaad nahin kiya gaya bhale hi yishu ko uske dwaara kiye jane vaale vishwasghaat ke bare main gyaan tha
 The answer may lie in the fact that the source of these lines may be in the imaginary QS document
 kyuu ke samay ko gauspel se pehle kaa mana jaataa he or yah sabase aarambhik isai dastavejon main se ek he
 Given this possibility, the story of betrayal may have been invented by the author of Mark
 jon shelbi spong kii pustak da sins of da scripchar is sambhaavna kii padtaal karti he ki aarambhik isaiyon ne juds kahani ko old tastomant kii teen yahudee vishwasghaat kahaniyon se sankalit kiya he
 He writes, "


 the discussion of betrayal by one of the twelve disciples is not found in early Christian writings
 juds ko isai kahani main sabase pehle gauspel of mark dwaara daalaa gaya he, jo kaaman era ke aathven dashak ke aarambhik varshon main lekhan karata tha"
 ve bataate hai ki kuch gauspel, suuli par chadhaane kii ghatana ke baad, shishyon kii sankhya ko "baarah" ke rup main ullikhit karte hai, jaise ki juds un ke bich main abhi bhi tha
 They compare three conflicting descriptions of Judas' death - by hanging, falling into a pit, and having a stomach burst, where three Old Testament deceptions discuss similar suicides
 spong kaa nishkarsh yah he ki pratham yahudee-roman yuddh ke baad, aarambhik bible lekhakon ne rome ke dushmano se khud ko dur rakhane kii koshish kii
 unhone dharmagranth ko ek shishy kii kahani jodakar sanvardhit kiya, jo yahudee rajya ke rup main juds main ubhara, jisane yishu ko yaa to dhokhaa diya yaa roman atyaachaariyon ke haathon saunp diya
 spong is sanvardhan ko aadhunik yahudee-virodh ke janak ke rup main pahchaan karte hai
 Jewish scholar Hyam Makobi favors a purely mythological view of Jesus and suggests that the name "judas" in the New Testament was coined as an attack on the Judaic or Judaic religious installations who are responsible for killing Christ

 mcclintic, juds ko na keval "priy shishy" ke rup main prastut karte hai, balki 'kyuu' dastauez ke lipic or lekhak ke rup main bhi dekhte hai, "apouls kride" or "jon gauspel" ke ek sachche lekhak ke rup main
 mcclintic, juds ko gauspel main maujuud yishu se sambandhit adhikansh kathaon ke strot ke rup main prastut karte hai, jisamen yishu ke janm se lekar, unki shiksha, unki shikshaayen or dharm se lekar unke mukademe, suuli par chadhane or punerjeevit hone kii katha shaamil he
 Judas has been a character of great interest to occult cults, such as to many mystic cults
 Irenaeus speaks of the beliefs of the Canites, a mystic sect, that he believed that Judas, Sophia, was a tool of the divine Manisha, thus earning him hatred of the Creator
 In the Hebrew Bible, Zechariah, the man who makes thirty pieces of silver, as Judas does in the Gospel, is a servant of God
 yishu se kiya gaya uskaa vishwasghaat, is prakaar bhautikwaadi duniya par ek jeet thi
 The Canites subsequently split into two groups and a disagreement arose between them about Jesus' ultimate importance in cosmology
 1970 ke dashak ke dauraan, ek coptic papirus code ko benny masa, misr ke paas paaya gaya, jo duusari shatabdi ke mul kaa teesri yaa chauthi sadi kii nakal thi, jisamen yishu kii mrityu kii kahani kaa varnan juds ke drushtikon se kiya gaya tha
 At its conclusion, the work identifies itself as the "gospel of Judas"

 The answer to this question is not to reform the Bible, but to reform itself "
 Other scholars, such as Louis Penchaud and Andre Gagne, have also questioned the early translation and interpretation of the Gospel of Judas by a team of experts from National Geographic
 gauspel of barnbas kii madhyayugin pratiyon ke anusaar, vah juds tha jise suuli par chadhaaya gaya tha, na ki yishu ko

 The pattern was so similar that the general public, followers of Christ and even Mary, the mother of Jesus, initially thought that the person who was arrested and crucified was Jesus
 gauspel phir yah ullekh karata he ki dafnane ke teen dinon baad, juds ke sharir ko uski kabr se chura liya gaya or tab yishu ke punerjeevit hone kii afvaahen fail gai
 When Jesus was told in the third heaven what happened, he prayed to God to send him back to Earth and so they came and gathered his mother, disciples and followers and told them the truth about what happened He went back to heaven and would just finally return as a king

 Judas has been given a small role in almost all of the Passion stories of literature and he is the legend of many modern novels and films
 holi vadensade ke eastern orthodox geeton main, juds kii tulana un auraton ke saath kii gai jinhone mahange itr ke saath yishu ko abhishikt kiya or apane aansuon se unke pairon ko dhoyaa
 gauspel of jon ke anusaar, juds ne is spasht apvyay kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki is par kharch kiya gaya paisa garibon ko diya janaa chahie

 Also, in memory of Judas' betrayal, Wednesday is celebrated throughout the year by not using meat, milk products and olive oil

 Judas has become an archetypal betrayal in Western culture, with some stories depicting their passion stories almost throughout literature

 Shabdant is a collection of poetry composed by noted Punjabi language litterateur Dev for which he was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for Punjabi Language in 2001
 platipus, jo battakhmunh plattipus bhi kehalaata he, purvi australia main rahane vaala ek standhari praani he
 It is one of the five known species of the monotreme gan of mammals, who, as mammals, feed their infants, but in which the mother lays eggs rather than conceive
 puure standhari samudaay main ande dene vaali keval yahi paanch jatiyaan he
 This is very important in terms of evolution because these species are a sign of a time when mammals were developing new and they did not have the capacity to develop babies in the womb
 isliye inhen jivit jeevashm kii shrenee main bhi daalaa jaataa he
 When European biologists first saw the dead body of a platypus in 1999, they refused to accept the existence of such a creature by seeing its duck-like snout, thick beaver-like beaver and beaver-like legs and the organs of different beings
 Accused of cheating by adding
 platipus un bahut kam stanadhariyon main se he jo vish se apni raksha kar sakate hai
 a thorn is formed on the heel of the hind legs of the male platypus which can be dug up and injected venom into another creature
 yadi maanav ko yah lag jaae to aamtaur par mrityu to nahin hoti lekin bhayankar peeda avashya hoti he
 It is believed that as Platypus had a tendency to lay eggs like reptiles, the trend of poisoning continued
 yah gun aage viksit hone vaale stanadhariyon main lupt ho gaye
 Except for dolphins, monotreme are the only mammals that have the power of electromagnetism, that is, they can sense the power used in the muscles of their grass animals
 shikaar karne ke liye platipus na to drushti kaa prayog karata he or na hi soonghney kii shakti kaa
 When he enters the water body, he closes the eyes, ears and nose
 jharanon-nadiyon main vah neeche jaakar farsh main swayan ko mitti main dabaa letaa he
 Then through the electromagnet, he knows that something coming out of the pass is alive or something strange
 yogya grass paas aate hi vah lapakata he
 It has been observed in experiments that if an artificial shrimp is extracted from it, the platypus tries to catch it and ignores it without electricity
 samaajwaad ek aarthik-saamaajik darshan he
 In the socialist system, the ownership and distribution of wealth is subject to the control of society
 aarthik, saamaajik or vaicharik pratyay ke taur par samaajwaad nijee sampatti par aadhaarit adhikaron kaa virodh karata he
 One of its basic pledges is that the production and distribution of wealth should be in the hands of society or the state
 raajnneeti ke aadhunik arthon main samaajwaad ko poonjeewaad yaa mukt bazaar ke siddhant ke vipareet dekha jaataa he
 Socialism as a political ideology has developed in the interplay of industrialization that emerged in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
 british raajnneetik vigyaani harold loski ne kabhi samaajwaad ko ek aisi topi kaha tha jise koi bhi apane anusaar pahan letaa he
 Different varieties of socialism shape this depiction of Lasky to a great extent
 samaajwaad kii ek kism vighatit ho chuke soviet sangh ke sarvasattavadi niyantran main charitaarth hoti he jisamen maanviya jivan ke har sambhav pahalu ko rajya ke niyantran main laane kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 Its second variety gives the state the mantra to play a welfare role by regulating the economy
 bharat main samaajwaad kii ek alag kism ke sutrikaran kii koshish kii gayi he
 The suffix emanating from the political thought and practice of Ram Manohar Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan and Narendra Dev is called 'gandhian Socialism'
 samaajwaad angreji or francisi shabd 'socialism' kaa hindi roopaantar he
 In the first half of the 19th century the term was used in opposition to individualism and in support of ideas that aimed to change the economic and moral basis of society and wanted to establish social control rather than individual control in life
 samaajwaad shabd kaa prayog anek or kabhi kabhi paraspar virdohi prasangon main kiya jaataa he; jaise samoohwaad araajaktaavaad, adikalin kabyli samyawad, sainya samyawad, isai samaajwaad, sahakaaritavaad, aadi - yahan tak ki natsi dal kaa bhi puraa naam 'rashtriya samaajawaadee dal' tha
 Socialism is difficult to define
 yah siddhant tathaa andolan, donon hi he or yah vibhinn aitihaasik or sthaneey paristhitiyon main vibhinn rup dhaaran karata he
 Essentially it is the movement that strives to establish a classless society based on the socialization of the main means of production and which makes the working class its mainstay, as it considers this class to be the exploited class whose historical work is to end the class system is
 adikalin samyavaadee samaaj main manushya parsparik sahyog dwaara aavashyak chizon kii prapti or prayek sadsy ke aavashyaktaanusaar unka aapas main bantwaaraa karte the
 But this communism was natural; Was not based on the conscious imagination of man
 aarambh ke isai padariyon kii rahan-sahan kaa dhang bahut kuch samyavaadee tha, ve ek saath or samaan rup se rahete the, parantu unki aay kaa strot dharmavalambiyon kaa daan tha or unka adarsh jansadharan ke liye nahin, varan keval padariyon tak simit tha
 Their purpose was also spiritual, not physical
 yahi baat madhyakaalin isai samyawad ke sambandh main bhi sahi he
 The ancient Inca civilization of the country of Peeru is called 'military communism', but its base was military organization and the system used to benefit the ruling class
 nagarpalikaon dwaara loksevaon ke sadhano ko praapt karnaa, athwa desh kii unnati ke liye aarthik yojanaon ke prayog maatr ko samaajwaad nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki yah aavashyak nahin ki inke dwaara poonjeewaad ko thes pahunche
 The Natsi party nationalized the banks, but the capitalist system remained intact
 samaajwaad kaa bhaavnaatmak dhaanchaa gadhane main england main satrahavin sadi ke dauraan isiyat ke daayre main viksit levelors tathaa diggars va solahavin or satrahavin sadi main madhya europe main viksit hone vaale ainabaptist jaise radical andolanon kii mahati bhoomika rahi he
 But the modern and formal hypothesis of socialism derives from the conclusions of French thinkers san-simons and Charles Furie and the British thinker Robert Owen
 samaajwaad ke ye shuruaati vichaarak vyaktvaad or pratisparddha kii jagah aapasi sahyog par aadhaarit samaaj kii kalpana karte the
 He believed that the social fabric could be given a better shape by creating a science of human nature and society
 parantu vaanchit saamaajik roopon ke thos byoron, unhen praapt karne kii ranneeti tathaa maanav prakruti kii samaj ko lekar unke bich kai tarah ke matbhed the
 For example, san-simo and Furie did not agree with Rousseau's view that human nature is good, sublime and rational in its design, but modern society and private property have corrupted it
 iske virodh main unka tark yah tha ki maanviya prakruti ke kuch sthir or nishchit rup hote hai jinka paraspar sahyog ke aadhaar par aapas main mail karaayaa ja saktaa he
 Owen's opinion was also different from sans-sims and furries
 unka kahana tha ki manushya kii prakruti bahari paristhitiyon se tay hoti he or use icchit rup diya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the conditions of society should be changed in such a way that the nature of human beings can move towards perfection
 unke anusaar agar pratisparddha or vyaktvaad kii jagah aapasi sahyog or ekta ko badhaava diya jayega to samoochee manushyata kaa bhala kiya ja saktaa he
 The political ideology of socialism began to become popular in European countries such as England, France and Germany during the third and fourth decades of the nineteenth century
 udyogikaran or shaharikaran kii tej gati tathaa parmparik samaaj ke avsaan ne europee samaaj ko sudhaar or badlaav kii shaktiyon kaa akhaada bana diya tha jisamen majdoor sanghon or charteravaadi samoohon se lekar aise gut sakriy the jo aadhunik samaaj kii jagah prak-aadhunik saamudayikthawaad kii vakaalat kar rahe the
 The idea of scientific socialism propounded by Marx and Engels developed in this background of social and political turmoil
 marks ne sain-simon, furiye or oven ke vichaaron se prerana to lee, lekin apane ‘vaigyanik’ samaajwaad ke mukaable unke samaajwaad ko ‘kaalpanik’ ghoshit kar diya
 Marx, like these earlier thinkers, does not consider socialism as an ideal to draw a clear vision of it
 marks or angels samaajwaad ko kisi swayan-bhu siddhant ke bajaay poonjeewaad kii karypranali se utpann hone vaali sthiti ke rup main dekhte hai
 He believed that any form of socialism would emerge from the historical process itself
 is samaj ke chalate marks or angels ko samaajwaad kii vistrut vyakhya karne yaa use paribhaashit karne se bhi gurez tha
 For him, socialism was mainly a suffix in denial of capitalism, which had to forge its own identity through a long revolutionary process
 samaajwaad ke vishay main marks kii sabase mahatvapurn rachana 'critic of da gotha program' he jisamen unhone samaajwaad ko samyavaadee samaaj ke do charnon kii madhyavarti avasthaa ke taur par vyakhyayit kiya he
 It is worth mentioning that this work of Marx was published eight years after his death
 tab tak marxvaadi siddhanton main ise zyaada mahatva nahin diya jaataa tha
 The credit for incorporating this discourse into the core principles of Marxism goes to Lenin, who, in his work 'state and Revolution', quoted Marx as describing socialism as the first or lower stage in the creation of communist society
 lenin ke baad samaajwaad marxvaadi shabdaawalee main is tarah vinyast ho gaya ki koi bhi vyakti yaa dal kisi khaas vaicharik dikkat ke bina khud ko samaajawaadee yaa samyavaadee kah saktaa tha
 The dividing line of this discussion was determined by what was the immediate and far-reaching goal of revolutionary activities for a party or individual
 yani agar koi khud ko samaajawaadee kahata tha to iskaa matlab yah hota tha ki vah samyavaadee samaaj kii rachana ke pehle charan par jor detaa he
 This is the reason that when the ruling parties in many socialist countries declared themselves as Communists, it was not considered inconsistent
 beesvin shatabdi main samaajwaad kaa antarrashtriya prasar tathaa soviet shashan vyavastha ek tarah se sahavarti parighatnaayen maani jaati hai
 This is a fact which has deeply influenced the idea of socialism and its future
 udaahranarth, kranti ke baad soviet sangh uske samarthakon or aalochakon, donon ke liye samaajwaad kaa paryaay ban gaya
 The Soviet proponents argued that the Soviet Union became an industrialized country in a very short period by adopting measures such as socialization of major means of production, subordinating the market to centralized planning, and state control over foreign trade and domestic finance
 jabaki uske aalochakon kaa kahana tha ki yah ek prachaarit chhavi thi kyonki viraat naukarshahi, raajnneetik daman, asamanta tathaa loktantr kii andekhi swayan hi samaajwaad ke adarsh ko khaarij karne ke liye kaaphi thi
 The Soviet Union's second role in the spread of socialism was that of an organizer
 samaajawaadee kranti ke prasar ke liye communist international jaise sanghathan kii sthapana karke usne khud ko samaajwaad kaa haraval siddh kiya
 This organization guided the communist parties of the world for a long time
 soviet sangh kii bhoomika kaa teesraa pahalu yah tha ki usne purvi europe main kai hamshakl shashan vyavasthaayen kaayam kii
 Ultimately the laboratory of Soviet Union socialism was also considered because after the Russian Revolution Stalin's leadership propagated the principle that the socialist revolution should be strengthened in a single country before spreading to other countries
 kai vidwaanon kii drushti main yah ek aisa sutrikaran tha jisane rashtriya samaajwaad kii kai kismon ke ubhaar ko vaidhata dilaayi
 During the process of de-colonization that began after World War II, this fusion of socialism and nationalism became a form of development of socialism in third world countries
 china, vietnam tathaa cuba jaise deshon main samaajwaad ke prasar kii yah ek kendriya pravriti thi
 Apart from Soviet-backed socialism, it has another form which has influenced the capitalist countries indirectly
 masalan, samaajwaad ke tark or uske aakarshan ko prati-santulit karne ke liye pashchim ke poonjeewaadi deshon ko apni arthvyavastha ke saanche ko badal kar use kalyankari rup dena padaa
 In this context, Scandinavian countries, western Europe and Australasia region countries, inspired by Keynes's philanthropic ideas, attempted to create an alternative to Soviet lines of socialism
 maang ke prabandhan, aarthik rashtrawaad, rojgaar kii guarantee, tathaa saamaajik sevaaon ke kshetra ko munafkhori kii pravritiyon se mukt rakhane kii niti par tike in kalyankari upayon ne ekbargi poonjeewaad or samaajwaad ke antar ko hi dhundla kar diya tha
 This welfare model of the state was once being described as a permanent cure for the anomalies of capitalism - unemployment, unemployment, scarcity, ignorance etc
 is model kii aarthik or raajnneetik kamyaabi kaa subut is baat ko mana ja saktaa he ki agar vampanthi daayaron main in upayon kii prashansa kii gayi to dakshinpanthi raajnneeti bhi unka khulaa virodh nahin kar saki
 This model of market-centric socialism continued to function quite effectively for three decades after the end of the Second World War
 lekin saatven dashak main mandi or mudrasphiti kii dohari maar tathaa kalyankari poonjeewaad ke garh main badhate saamaajik or audyogic asantosh ke kaaran is model ke auchity ko lekar sawaal khadey hone lage
 Scholars of the Marxist camp had also been consistently saying that instead of eliminating inequality and exploitation, welfare problems have strengthened capitalism itself
 is model kaa ek aapattijanak pahalu yah bhi prakat hua ki kaamgaar varg ko jivan kii buniyadi suvidhaayen pradaan karne vaali mashinari ke dwaara rajya us par niyantran karne kii sthiti main aa gaya
 The neo-liberal intellectuals had been opposing this model from the beginning, keeping the market intact and implementing some elements of socialism
 saatven dashak main yah varg jor-shor se kehane laga tha ki samaajwaad na keval arthvyavastha ko jad bana detaa he balki vyakti kii swatantraaa bhi chin letaa he
 In the nineties, when the socialist systems of Eastern Europe collapsed one after another with the Soviet Union, this criticism of socialism began to gain wide legitimacy and talk of the end of history with socialism
 vijay ke unmaad main udaaravaadi buddhijiviyon ne yah bhi kaha ki manushyata ke liye poonjeewaad hi ekmaatr vikalp he lihaaja ab uske vikalp kii baat bhuulakar keval yah sochaa janaa chahie ki poonjeewaad kii koi or shakl kya ho sakati he
 Karl Marx's fellow Angels named the earliest currents of modern socialism as conceptual socialism
 in vichaaron kaa aadhaar bhautik or vaigyanik nahin, naitik tha; inke vichaarak dhyey kii prapti ke sudhaarwadi sadhano main vishwaas karte the; or bhavi samaaj kii vistrut parantu avastavik kalpana karte the
 These include the socialist ideas of the Seams, Charles Furie, and Robert Owen
 {mukhya}vaigyanik samaajwaad}} The Fabian Society was established in Britain in 1883–84 AD
 rowart owain tathaa chartist andolan ke prabhaav se yahan swatantra majdoor andolan kii neenv pad chuki thi, fabian socity ne is andolan ko darshan diya
 The name of this gathering is derived from Fabius Kunketer Fabian
 fabius pracheen rome kaa ek senaanee tha jisane kaarthenge ke prasiddh senanayake hannibal ke viruddh sangharsh main dhairya se kaam liya or gurila niti dwaara usko kai varshon main parrast kiya
 Similarly, the Fabian socialists are of the view that capitalism cannot be defeated by revolutionary path in just one encounter
 iske liye paryaapt kaal tak soch-vichaar or taiyaari kii aavashyaktaa he
 His method is developmental and reformist
 swatantra majdoor dal kii sthapana ke purv ye britain ke vibhinn raajnneetik dalon main pravesh kar apana uddeshy puraa karnaa chaahate the
 Their main objective was the reconstruction of society according to extreme moral possibilities
 ye rajya ko vargshasan kaa yantra na maanakar ek saamaajik yantra maanate hai jiske dwaara samaajakalyaan or samaajwaad kii sthapana sambhav he
 These thinkers adopted the program of socialist experiments not only by Parliament but also by municipal and rural regional councils
 at: inke vichaaron ko loktantreey, sansadeey, bailat baks, chungi, vikaas athwa sudhaarwadi samaajwaad kii sangya di jaati he

 in vichaarkon par british parampara, upyogetavaad, rabart owain, isai samaajwaad or chartist andolan tathaa jon stuart mil ke arthshaastriyon ke vichaaron kaa gaharaa prabhaav he
 German recapitalism was influenced by Britain's Fabiusism and the changed circumstances of Germany

 Marx's ideas had influence on these countries
 parantu 19veen shatabdi ke ant main germany main bhi audyogic unnati hui or rajya ne kuch vyaktigat tathaa raajnneetik adhikaar sweekaar kiye
 As a result, the standard of living of workers increased and the influence of their political party - Social Democratic Party, also increased
 uske anek sadsy sansad ke sadsy ban gaye
 In this situation, this force in principle became reformist in practice even after accepting the revolutionary path of Marx
 aduard bernstin ne is vaastaviktaa ke aadhaar par marxvad ke sanshodhan kaa praytn kiya
 Bernstein was a prominent philosopher of the Social Libertarian Party and a close disciple of Angels
 vah britain main kai varsh tak nirvasit rahaa or vahaan fabiaswad se prabhavit hua
 Marx's statement was that due to mutual competition and economic crises, the capitalist and middle class would shrink and the working class would become poor, broad, organized and revolutionary which would soon lead to the establishment of socialism
 sthiti iske vipareet thi, jisko bernstin ne sweekaar kiya or is aadhaar par usne krantikari kaarykram ke sthaan main taatkaalik samajasudhar or samaajwaad kii safalataa ke liye vargsangharsh ke sthaan main shrenee-sahyog tathaa sansadatmak or sanvaidhanik maarg par jor diya
 He also began to accept the influence of moral and uneconomical elements in place of Marx's historical materialism
 bernstin ke vichaaron ko punraritivaad ko naam diya gaya
 Although the German labor movement remained reformist in practice, it expressed confidence in Marx's ideas by rejecting Bernstein's amendments under the leadership of Karl Kautsky
 fabiuswadi or punraritivaadee vichaarak samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye rajya ko aavashyak samajhate hai
 Communist thinkers also want to use the power of Adam for the transition period

 Anarchist thinkers are also anti-capitalists and supporters of socialism but they consider state, politics and religion as advocates of exploitative system and want to end it from the beginning
 araajaktaavaad jivan or aacharan kaa ek siddhant he jo shashanviheen samaaj kii kalpana karata he
 It seeks to establish the unity of society not by governance and law, but by independent agreements between individuals and local and professional groups

 Its French form is named Syndicism and British Guild Socialism
 sindikawaad or gild samaajwaad kaa janm unnisvin shatabdi ke ant or beesvin ke aarambh main hua
 By that time, the workers' faith in Fabius and Revivalism had begun to wane
 loktantr mazdooron kii samasyaayen sulajhane main asafal rahaa, aarthik sankat vikat rup dhaaran karne laga or yuddh kii sambhaavna badhane lagi
 At the same time the number of laborers increased, their organization strengthened and they went on a massive strike to fulfill their demands
