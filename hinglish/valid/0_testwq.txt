 puraane jamaane main "niharika" khagol main dikhne vaali kisi bhi vistrut vastu ko kehete the
 Any galaxy beyond the galaxy was called a nebula
 baad main jab edwin habal ke anusandhan se yah gyaat hua ki yah gallexiyaan hai, to naam badal die gaye
 For example, the Andromeda Galaxy was previously known as the Andromeda Nabula
 niharikaon main aksar taare or grahiy mandal janm lete hai, jaise ki chil niharika main dekha gaya he
 This nebula is depicted in a very famous picture called "pillars of Creation" drawn by NASA

 The remaining material is believed to constitute the planets and other objects of the planetary system
 "niharika" ko angrezi main "nebula" likhaa jaataa he
 It is a Latin language word and used to mean "cloud", the plural meaning "nebulai", "nebulay" or "nebulis"
 is baat ke pramaan uplabdh hai ki doorabeen ke avishkaar ke pehle se maaya logon ko niharikaon ke bare main pataa tha
 a folklore pertaining to the area of the sky surrounding the deer constellation supports this theory
 kahani main ullekh he ki dadhakati aag ke aasapaas ek dhabba he
 Claudius Ptolemy, about 150 AD, mentions five stars appearing in nebulae in issue VII-VIII of his book Almagest
 unhone saptarshi taramandal main ek badalon se yukt yaa dhundhale kshetra kaa bhi ullekh kiya tha, jo kisi bhi taare ke saath nahin judaa tha
 Unlike the galaxies, the first real nebula was mentioned by the Persian astronomer Abd al-rahman al-sufi in his "situated Star Book"
 unhone andromeeda gallexi ke sthaan par "ek chota badal" dekha tha
 He characterized the Omricran Velorum constellation Punj as a "nebulous star" or obscure star and other obscure objects in Bruchi's cluster
 1054 main arab or chini khagolavidon dwaara craib nebyal SN 1054 kii rachana karne vaale supernova ko dekha gaya tha
 al-sufi failed to recognize the Orion nebiyal due to unknown reasons, which appears at least as clear as the Andromeda sky Ganges in the night sky
 26 navambar 1610 ko nicholas-claude fabi de piresk ne ek doorabeen kaa upyog kar orion nebyal kaa avishkaar kiya
 In 1618 John the Baptist Cyst also studied this nebula
 haalanki, 1659 tak arthath isai higence jo apane ko niharikaon yaa is khagoleey dhundhalake kaa avishkaar karne vaale pehla vyakti maanate the, se pehle orion nebyal par koi vistrut adhyayan nahin hua
 In 1715, Edmund Halley published a list of six nebulae
 Throughout the century, the number continued to increase, with the compilation of a list of 20 released in 1746 by Jean Philippe de Chasaux
 Nicolas Louis de Lacale listed 42 nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope in 1751–53
 Most of which were previously unknown
 iske baad charles mesier ne 1781 tak 103 niharikaon kii suchi banaai, haalanki unke aisa karne kii pramukh vajah thi - dhoomaketuon kii galat pahchaan se bachanaa
 Subsequently, the efforts of William Herschel and his sister Caroline Herschel increased the number of nebulae
 unki kaitalong of van thaujend new nebylai and cluster of stars 1786 main prakashit hui
 ek hajaar kii duusari suchi 1789 main or 510 kii teesri tathaa antim suchi 1802 main prakashit kii gayi thi
 Throughout much of his work, William Herschel was convinced that these nebulae were mere underdeveloped stars
 haalanki, 1790 main, unhone aspashtataa se ghire ek taare kii khoj kii or yah nishkarsh nikaala ki yah adhik duuri par sthit samooh na hokar ek vaastavik ghatatope yaa niharika thi
 In early 1864, William Huggins investigated the spectra or range of about 70 nebulae
 They found that about a third of them had a wide range of gas inclusions
 baaki main ek satat vistrut shrenee dikhaai di or inhen sitaron kaa ek samooh mana gaya
 In 1912, a third category was added when Vesto Slifer demonstrated that the nebulae around the Meropee star resembled the Pleiades open starfish
 is prakaar niharika taron ke prativimvit prakaash dwaara chamakta he
 Slifer and Edwin Hubble continued to collect a wide range of these from several diffused nebulae and discovered that 29 of these showed emission spectra and 33 had continuous spectra of starlight
 1922 main habal ne ghoshnaa kii ki lagbhag sabhi niharikaayen sitaron se judy hai or unki roshni taron ke prakaash se aati he
 They also discovered that nebulae in the emission spectrum are almost always warmer than B1 or more, whereas nebulae with continuous spectra appear with relatively cold stars
 habal or henry noris rasel donon ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki garm taron ke aasapaas kii niharikaayen kisi na kisi prakaar se parivartit ho rahi hai
 Many nebulae are formed due to the mutual gravity of the gas in the interstellar medium
 apane nijee bhaar ke tahat dravya ke sankuchit hone kii vajah se centre main anek vishaal sitaron kaa gathan ho saktaa he or unka parabangnee prakaash aasapaas kii gaison ko ynit kar prakaash tarangon par unhen drushtigochar banaata he
 Rosette Nebiel and Pelicon Nebiel are examples of such nebulae
 HII kshetra ke naam se parichit is prakaar kii niharikaon kaa aakaar, gas ke vaastavik badalon ke aakaar par nirbhar hota he
 This is where stars are formed
 isse gathit sitaron ko kabhi-kabhi ek yuva, deele cluster ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Some nebulae are formed as a result of explosions in supernovae, ie the end of large and short-gv stars
 supernova ke visphot se bikharanevaali saamagree urja dwaara ynit hoti he or isse nirmit ho sakanevaali thos vastu kaa gathan hota he
 The Crab Nebula of Taurus constellation is the best example of this
 varsh 1054 main supernova kii ghatana darj kii gayi or ise or SN1054 ke rup main chihnit kiya gaya
 The solid object formed after the explosion is located in the center of the Crab Nebule and is a neutron star
 anya niharikaayen grahiy niharikaon kaa gathan kar sakati hai
 Like the Earth's sun, it is the last phase of the life of a low-mass mass star
 8-10 saura dravyaman vaale taare laal daanav taron ke rup main viksit hote hai or apane vaataavaran main spandan ke dauraan dhire-dhire apni baheri parat kho dete hai
 When a star loses enough material, its temperature rises and the ultraviolet radiation emitted from it can ionize the nebula thrown around it
 niharika main avshisht saamagree sahit 97% hydrogen or 3% helium he
 The main goal of this phase is to achieve balance
 niharikaon ko chaar pramukh samoohon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 Earlier galaxies and round galaxies were considered to be different types of practicals

 Diffuse nebulae near the stars are examples of reflection nebulae
 adhikansh niharikaon ko visarit niharikaayen kaha ja saktaa he, jiskaa arth he ki ve vistrut hai evam kisi sarvamaanya paribhaasha kii seemaa main nahin aatin
 In visible light, these nebulae can be divided into emission nebulae and reflection nebulae, based on how the visible light is composed to us
 utsarjan niharika main ayanit gas hota he, jo utsarjan kii dhundhlee rekha banaati hai
 These emission nebulae are often called HII fields, with the term "HII" often used for ionized hydrogen in commercial astronomy
 utsarjan niharikaon kii tulana main, pratibimb niharikaayen swayan paryaapt maatra main dikhaai dene yogya prakaash rekha nahin banaatin balki apane aasapaas ke sitaron ke prakaash ko pratibimbit karti hai
 Dark or dark nebulae are the same as diffuse nebulae, but they cannot be seen by the light emitted or reflected by them
 Instead, they are seen as dark clouds in front of distant stars or emission nebulae
 haalanki ye niharikaayen prakaash tarangon par alag-alag dikhaai detii hai, par ve sabhi infrared yaa avarakt taragon par utsarjan ke ujjwal strot hai
 This emission mainly comes from the dust inside the nebulae
 grahiy niharikaayen, ve niharikaayen hai, jo lo-moss ananthasparshi vishaal shakha sitaron ke safed boune main parivartit hone ke samay unase nikalanevaale gas yukt khol se gathit hoti hai
 These nebulae are emitting nebulae with blurred emission, similar to those of emission nebulae found in star-forming regions
 takneekee taur par, yah HII kshetra hai kyonki adhiktar hydrogen ynit hoga
 However, planetary nebulae are more dense and more solid than emission nebulae found in star-forming regions
 grahon kii niharikaon ko yah naam isliye diya gaya he kyonki jin pehle khagolavidon ne in vastuon kaa adhyayan kiya tha unhone sochaa ki niharikaayen grahon kii tastariyon yaa discon jaisi dikhti hai, haalanki, ve grahon se sanvandhit nahin hai
 a proto planetary nebula is an astronomical object, a short-lived episode of the rapid stellar gradual evolution of a star between the position of the former asymptomatic giant branch and the phase of the post-planetary nebula
 ek PPN shashakt avarakt vikiran utsarjit karata he or ek pratibimb niharika he
 The actual point of formation of a PPN planetary nebula is defined by the temperature of the central star
 jab ek hai-moss sitara apane jivan ke ant tak pahunch jaataa he tab supernova ghatit hota he
 When nuclear fusion stops at the star's core or center, the star disintegrates
 andar risnevaali gas yaa to pratikshipt hoti he athwa itani adhik garm ho jaati he ki yah kendra se baahar kii ore failati he tathaa taare ke visphot kaa kaaran banati he

 Robert mccarley and his colleagues state that the primary cause of adenosine congestion may be the sensation of drowsiness after prolonged mental activity, and that sleep-stimulated stimulation of awakening-stimulated nerves via A1 receptors and indirect effects on A2A receptors These effects may be mediated by activation of nerves
 Recent studies have provided additional evidence for the importance of A2A, not A1 receptors

 Since Saint Namdev is called his Guru, his time period should be around this

 Once Chokhamela came to Pandharpur where Kirtan of Saint Namdev was being done

 The Bhakti-movement definitely strengthened the castes called the following

 hamen aise kai prasang milte hai, jab namdev ne sanathan hindu panda-pujaariyon ke krodh se chokhamela kaa bich-bachaav kiya tha
 The task of Chokamela's fathers and grandfathers was to pick up the dead animals in the Hindu houses of the village and take them outside the village and hide them
 iske liye unhen koi mehnatnama nahin diya jaataa tha
 At that time, separate neighborhoods of the Mahars were outside the village

 Oil painting is the name of the marking of the picture in which oil-dyed paint is used
 19veen shatee ke purv europe main hi iskaa prayog adhik hua, purvi deshon main tel madhyam se us kaal main chitrankan kaa koi ullekhneey pramaan praapt nahin he
 Although oil varnish making is mentioned in the 8th century "manuscript of Luke", its use with colors is first mentioned by Theophilus, Eraclius, and Peter the Saint Ademar in the 12th century
 ye teenon europe main alps parvat ke uttar ke nivasee the
 In Italy, oil painting was done long before these, it is believed, says that Florence's famous painter Giotto sometimes used oil medium
 eastlake kaa kathan he ki "germany, france, italy or england main kam se kam 14veen sadi me tailchithran prachlit tha
 "but the developed form of oil medium starts to appear from the 15th-16th century
 kintu yah dharna bhi prachlit he ki dach chitrakaar jaan phan aayak ne hi tel madhyam se chitrankan shuru kiya tha
 The oil medium is simpler than other mediums and transparent colors are the most transparent in it, so they look beautiful
 pani kaa bhi koi asar tel chitron par fouran nahin hota
 This is why this medium is so popular
 tailchithran main aamtaur se astr chadhe canvas par tel main ghonte gaye gadhe chipchipe rangon ko burush se lagaaya jaataa he
 Mostly flaxseed and poppy oil are used for this
 telon kaa chunaav vibhinn deshon main ruchi or aavashyaktaa par nirbhar karata he
 The earlier painter Neetanusa used to prepare his colors before he started his degree, but for the last 100 years, like the aquatic colors, oil colors are also available in tubes
 bijon ko bina garm kiye hue nikaala hua alsi kaa tel dhoop or hawa me shodhakar prayog kiya jaae to usamen rang maile nahin dikhte or tikte bhi zyada hai
 To dilute the colors and to dry quickly, earlier used to mix linseed or turpentine oil, but nowadays bright colors are not preferred, so only mix turpentine oil or petrol by not mixing linseed oil
 canvas sooti kapade kaa athwa san kaa banaaya jaataa he
 Its surface is rough or flat according to different interests and needs
 canvas ke alaava gatte, kaagaj, kaach, lakdi, taanbe, jaste kii chaadaren or diwaar par bhi astr chadhaakar tel madhyam se chitrankan kiya jaataa he
 Many painters are also using plied, hardboard, aluminum and asbestos etc
 as they are accessible and cheap and can be found in large sizes
 astr banane ke liye jis cheez par chitra bananaa he us par sares kaa halakaa lep chadhaate hai, suukh jane par, safed rang, alsi kaa tel or varnish milakar aavashyaktaanusaar do teen kot lagaae jate hai
 There have been different prescriptions in different periods of preparation of land and different painters
 canvas ko ek chaukhate par taana jaataa he
 Nowadays, different varieties of canvas are found ready in the market
 pracheen kaal kaa canvas yaa anya vastuon kii jameen kaa rang kuch katthi rangath kaa hota tha par aajkal ke chitrakaar safed rang kii jameen pasand karte hai
 Made of pig hair, long handled, flat and round burush is more common, but some painters prefer burush made of sable hair for flat and soft marking
 rangon ko mahogany kii lakdi athwa kaach yaa chini mitti kii ek plate par churi se milaayaa jaataa he
 These plates and knives have different samples
 pracheen kaal main rang sipiyon or pyaalon main bhi rakhe jate the
 It is customary to make oil paintings mostly on "easel" and stand still
 europe main to anya chitra bhi khadey hokar banaae jate hai
 But in this medium, there is a facility to work exclusively from standing, because pictures can be seen from time to time even if necessary and colors do not apply to the body
 pracheen chitrakaar canvas par pehle angoor kii belon ke koyale se rekhankan kar lete the, phir keval kisi ek rang se "shed" aadi lagaakar chitra ko puraa kar lete the
 After this, thin layers of colors were applied in it, so that the color of the bottom was also reflected
 isi tarah dhire dhire vaanchhneeya prabhaav praapt hone tak rang lagaae jate
 Rambran Rubens and Titties were unmatched in this type of notation
 kala ke anya gunon ke alaava burush kaa daksh prayog unke chitron kii visheshta he jo keval tel chithran main hi sambhav he
 Nowadays, many painters prefer to work on canvas or other surfaces with a straight knife, not using burush
 aisa keval apni ruchi or style ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This type of painting is very thick and effective
 par isamen badi dakshata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he kyonki burush se ankit chitra kii bhanti is prakaar ke chitron ko ek baar bighad jane par sudhaarna sambhav nahin
 After the painting was completed, the old painters applied varnish on it after a few months, so that it was unaffected by seasonal changes
 varnish se chitron main kuch chamak bhi aa jaati he
 Varnish is rarely used by any painter nowadays, as glow in colors is not preferred nowadays
 tel madhyam se bane chitron kaa sabase bada dosha yah hota he ki kuch kaal ke pashchaat ve pile padane lagate hai
 Pictures kept in moisture and dark turn yellow even more quickly
 rang kii pehali tah main kam tel ho or baad vaali main zyada tathaa ek tah suukh jane ke baad hi duusari tah lagaai jaae to rang baad main chatakhte nahin hai
 By applying wax varnish on the back side of the canvas, the canvas lasts longer and the colors are protected
 bharatvarsh main tel ke rangon kaa prayog europea chitrakaaron dwaara 1800 i ke lagbhag shuru hua
 The name of King Ravivarma of Travancore is notable among the early Indian oil painters
 bharatvarsh main vishesh rup se shabih chithran ke liye tel madhyam pasand kiya jaataa he
 From the middle of the 19th century, religious images were made on glass through this medium in Trichinapalli
 aajkal ke chitrakaar tailchitron kii apeksha phir se jaleey or andey kii zardi ke saath ghonte rangon ko pasand karne lage hai
 Paintings made of these colors are more durable

 Saturdays were also published in Gujarat newspapers about his personality
 cartoonon main inke chitra ek lambii chadi ke saath hote the jisamen inhen gandhi topi bhi pahane hue dikhaaya jaataa tha
 It used to be a satire that a stubborn person, influenced by Gandhiji's personality but sticking to his word
 swatantraaa sangram main bhagidaari ke kaaran morarji desai ke kai varsh zelon main hi guzare
 At the time of the country's independence, his name had gained weight in national politics
 lekin morarji kii praathmik ruchi rajya kii raajnneeti main hi thi
 That is why he was made the Chief Minister of Bombay in 1952
 is samay tak gujarat tathaa maharashtra bombai provins ke naam se jane jate the or donon rajyon kaa pruthak gathan nahin hua tha
 After Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1967, Morarji was made Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister
 lekin vah is baat ko lekar kunthit the ki varisht congress netaa hone par bhi unke bajaay indira gandhi ko pradhanmantri banaaya gaya
 This is the reason why Morarji continued to obstruct the revolutionary measures being taken by Indira Gandhi
 darasal jis samay shri kamraj ne syndicate kii salaah par indira gandhi ko pradhanmantri banaae jane kii ghoshnaa kii thi tab morarji bhi pradhanmantri kii daud main shaamil the
 When he did not agree in any way, the party held the election on this issue and Indira Gandhi won the election with a heavy vote
 indira gandhi ne morarji ke ahan kii tushti ke liye inhen up pradhanmantri kaa pad diya
 The discipline in the Congress at the time of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru began to crumble after his death 
 kai sadsy swayan ko party se bada samajhate the
 Morarji Desai was also one of them
 shri bahadur shastri ne congress party ke vafaadaar sipaahi kii bhanti kaary kiya tha
 He had never demanded any position from the party
 lekin is maamle main morarji desai apwaad main rahe
 His differences with the Congress organization were well known and becoming Prime Minister of the country included his priorities
 indira gandhi ne jab yah samaj liya ki morarji desai unke liye kathinaaiyaan paidaa kar rahe hai to unhone morarji ke par katarma armbh kar diya
 For this reason, it was natural for them to be angry
 navambar 1969 main jab congress kaa vibhaajan congress-aar or congress-o ke rup main hua to morarji desai indira gandhi kii congress-ai ke bajaae syndicate ke congress-o main chale gaye
 Then in 1975 he joined the Janata Party
 march 1977 main jab loksabhaa ke chunaav hue to janata party ko spasht bahumat praapt ho gaya
 But here also two other prime ministerial contenders were present - Chaudhary Charan Singh and Jagjivan Ram
 lekin jaiprakash narayan jo swayan kabhi congressi hua karte the, unhone king mekar kii apni sthiti kaa laabh uthaate hue morarji desai kaa samarthan kiya
 After this, on 23 March 1977, at the age of 81, Morarji Desai assumed the responsibility of the Indian Prime Minister
 inke pradhanmantritv ke aarmabhik kaal main, desh ke jin nau rajyon main congress kaa shashan tha, vahaan kii sarkaron ko bhang kar diya gaya or rajyon main nae chunaav karaaye jane kii ghoshnaa bhi kara di gai
 This was undemocratic and unconstitutional act
 janata party, indira gandhi or unki samarthit congress kaa desh se safaaya karne ko kritasankalp nazar ai
 But this act did not receive appreciation by intellectuals

 Its orbit around the sun is also a little clumsy - it is sometimes 30 astronomical units away from the sun by going inside Varuna's orbit and sometimes reaching 45 khz away from the sun
 pluto kyper ghere kii anya vastuon kii tarah adhiktar jami hui nitrogen kii barf, pani kii barf or pathar kaa bana hua he

 Then, after 1990, scientists began to find many cross-border objects whose orbits, looks and designs resembled those of Pluto
