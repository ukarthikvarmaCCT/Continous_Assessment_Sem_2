mrit bhashaa yaa vilupt bhashaa use kaha jaataa he, jise bolne vaala koi bhi jivit nahin ho
 Even if the language is being used in other ways by the speakers of another language
 is tarah ke bhashaaon kaa koi maatrubhaashi nahin hota he
 The reason for the death or extinction of a language is the acceptance of another language by their speakers or the death of all of them
 saamanytah yadi us bhashaa kaa sthaan sidhe sidhe koi anya bhashaa le leti he to us bhashaa kaa duusare bhashaaon main anuwaad bhi sambhav hota he
 For example, on several languages made in America, the colonies of English, French, Portuguese etc
 replaced the language there with their own language
 is tarah ke badlaav se anuwaad to kiya ja saktaa he lekin us bhashaa ko usee rup main punerjeevit nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki kai vaakya or shabd usee ke saath hameshaa ke liye mit jate hai
 Whoever has no people to speak or write is considered an extinct language
 is tarah kii bhashaaon ko mrit bhashaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 Economic and cultural globalization and development have become a threat to many weak languages
 vishwa bazaar main aasaani se baatcheet karne ke liye log apni maatrubhaasha ko chhod kar angreji, chini, spani or francisi aadi bhashaaon ko seekhney kaa prayaas karte hai
 Due to this, it affects their mother tongue
 america bhashavid sara grey thomson or terrence coyman ne 1991 main bhashaa parivartan par adhyayan kiya tha, jisamen unhone kaha ki bhashaa ke vilupti ke teen mukhya kaaran he
 The first and most common reason is for speakers of a language to suddenly learn another major language, leaving their language
 doosraa kaaran, kai pidiyon dwaara dhire dhire bhashaa kii maut hona
 The third and most rare reason is that the grammar and words of a language change almost or completely, that is, to borrow excessive grammar and words from a major language, as well as many mother tongues of that language, to make that language redundant words and rules of grammar
 Try to save by borrowing
 is kaaran us bhashaa ko bolne vaale, us pramukh bhashaa ko bolnaa shuru kar dete hai or unki maatrubhaasha ko chhod dete hai
 Education system and media such as internet, television and print media etc
 are also helpful in decolonizing the language
 jaise yadi koi ek desh se duusare desh main jaataa he to uske bachche us desh ke shiksha sansthaanon main jis bhashaa main padhai hota he, usee main apni padhai karte hai
 In such a situation, they get away from their mother tongue
 america main bane kai bhashaayen angreji, francisi, portugali aadi ke upniveshon ke kaaran ab mrit yaa vilupt bhashaa ban gai he
 In the 19th century or before, many countries were attacked and looted by foreign invaders
 inamen pustak aadi bhi shaamil the
 Libraries, historical heritage etc
 were destroyed by these invaders, so that only their culture and language remained there

 Bhamah considered the curvature an ornament
 unke parvarti kuntak ne vakrokti ko ek sampurna siddhant ke rup main viksit kar kavy ke samast angon ko isamen samavisht kar liya
 Therefore Kuntaka is considered the promoter of the Vakrokti sect
 vakrokti siddhant kii pratishtha tathaa pratipaadan kaa shrey kuntak ko he parantu isaki parampara pracheen he
 References to Bhamah's predecessor poets Baan, Subandhu etc
 are found
 bhamah ne vakrokti kaa prayog vyapak arth main kiya he
 He considered the inflection of both the word and the meaning in quibble
 unhone vakrokti tathaa atishyokti kaa samaan arth main prayog kiya he
 Exaggeration means popular transcendence
 vakrokti ko isi kaaran bhamah mul alankaar maanate hai
 Without it, the sentence is no longer a poem, but dialogue remains
 dandi ne bhi vakrokti ko bhamah ke samaan mahatv diya he
 Dandi has given two distinctions of Venmayya - Swabhokti and Vakrokti
 dandi ne vakrokti tathaa atishyokti ko samast alankaaron ke mul main sweekaar kiya he
 The only difference between Bhamah and Dandi is that Bhamah accepts the expression at the periphery of curvature and Dandi considers it to be less important than the curve statement considering it to be different
 anandavardhan ne vakrokti kii swatantra vyakhya nahin kii he
 They have accepted its general and comprehensive form by considering it as a special ornament
 anandavardhan ne bhamah ke vakrokti sambandhi mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue atishyokti tathaa vakrokti ko paryaay mana or sabhi alankaaron ko atishyokti garbhit sweekaar kiya he
 Abhinavagupta has accepted the general form of curvature
 inke anusaar shabd or arth kii vakrata kaa aashay unki lokottar sthiti he tathaa is lokottar kaa arth atishay hi he
 Kuntaka, the originator of Vakrokti theory, called Vakrokti the soul of poetry in his treatise Vakrokti Jeevam
 unhone vakrokti ke antargat sabhi kavy siddhanton kaa samaahaar karte hue samast kavyangon- varna chamatkaar, shabd saundarya, vishaywastu kii romaniyata, aprastut-vidhaan, prabandh kalpana aadi ko uchit sthaan diya he
 According to Kuntaka, quibble is not just speech or utterance miracle, it is poet business or poet skill
 dow nagendra ke anusaar "aadhunik shabdaawalee main ise kalawaad kah sakate hai- kavy kaa sarvapramukh tatv kala he
 This does not mean that Kuntaka has ruled out the subject matter in his theory
 unhone kavy vastu kii swaabhaavik romaniyata ko sweekaar kiya he
 The poet should express the heart-rending religions of the poetic object
 yah kavi pratibha se hi sambhav he
 Thus, according to him, the poet business is ultimately dominant
 " In Indian poetry theory, Rasa theory is based on cognition or emotion and Alankar theory is based on the poet's imagination
 vakrokti siddhant kaa sambandh is drushti se alankaar siddhant se he
 The imagery of figures of speech in quibble has been widely accepted
 yah kalpana kavinishth he, sahrudayanishth nahin
 The difference between sound and quibble is also that the imagery of sound is benign and the imagery of curvature is poetic
 atah dhwani kaa drushtikon vyaktiparak he or vakrokti kaa vastunishth
 Kuntaka has accepted the importance of emotion along with imagination by considering Rasa as the soul of curvature
 kuntak ne ras ko vakrata kaa vishisht ang maan kar bhi angi vakrata ko hi mana he
 The condition of Ras without curvature is not possible whereas curvature without juice has its own independent position
 kuntak ne aisi sthiti ko mahatv nahin dete hue rasvihin vakrata ko tiraskaar yogya mana he
 The quibble theory of Kuntaka is a broad and co-ordinate theory
 isaki udbhaavna ke mul main alankaar siddhant kii parampara ke saath dhwani siddhant he
 The whole poetry has been accepted in Kuntaka's curvature theory

 According to Dave mccomas, executive director of the South West Research Institute in San Antonio, USA, these winds that move at millions of miles per hour from the Sun create a protective bubble around the solar system

 Nirjara is an element according to Jain philosophy
 iskaa arth hota he aatma ke saath jude karmon kaa shay karnaa
 These births are necessary to be free from the cycle of death
 acharya umaswami dwaara virachit jain granth tattwarth sutara kaa 9 adhyay is vishay par hai
 Nirjra occurs after the spring
 jain granth dravyasangrah ke anusaar karm aatma ko dhoomil karte dete hai, nirjara se aatma phir nirmalata ko praapt hoti hai
 Nirjara has two distinctions: jain granthon ke anusaar tap se nirjara hoti hai
 According to Tattvarthasutra, twenty-two parishes are tolerable for Nirjara
 kaary bindu ek ikai he jiske jariye yah mapa jaataa he ki koi soochna pranali apane prayokta ko kitni vyavsaayik kaary kii suvidha detii he
 Work points are a measuring unit of the IFPUG work size measurement method
 iepapiuji kii ethesam vidhi iesao sweekrut tantransh maapak he jiske jariye soochna pranali ke prayokta ko pradutt suvidhaon ke aadhaar par uske aakaar ko napa jaataa he
 This measurement is not affected by the technology used to implement information systems
 iepapiuji ethesam vidhi iesao maanakon dwaara sweekrut tantransh ko kaary ke aadhaar par maapne ke paanch maanakon main se ek he
 Function points were defined by ibm's Alan Albrecht in 1979 through "a new perspective towards devices"
 tantransh kii kaarysambandhi prayokta aavashyaktaayen ke bare main pataa lagaaya jaataa he or phir harek ko in paanch prakaaron main baanta jaataa he - pradaan, prashn, aadan, aantarik filein va bahya antaraprishth
 Once the work is identified and its type determined, the same complexity is assessed and accordingly some action points are provided
 har kaarysambandhi prayokta aavashyaktaa kisi prayokta ke vyapaar sambandi kaary se sidhaa sambandhit hota he, udhaaharan ke liye pradaan ke liye saamagree pravishti yaa poochtacha ke liye prayokta dwaara prashn
 This is necessary because through this, the functions captured in the work points can be easily understood as user-centric requirements, but this hides the internal activities, although they will take resources to implement them
 beete kai saalon main is kathith kamazori se nipatane ke liye kai tareeke sujhaaye gaye hai, lekin aisi koi iesao maanya ethesam vidhi nahin he jo maap main kalan vidhi kii jatilta ko tavajjo detii ho
 There are also some different methods to deal with this from the Albrecht based IFPUG method: kisi soochna pranali ke aakaar ko naap ke use kaary binduon main abhivyakt karne kii vidhi ko kaary bindu vishleshan kaha jaataa he
 Global collaborative FPA user groups, such as NESMA and IFPU, continue to work to improve this method continuously
 kaary bindu vishleshan kisi soochna pranali ke kaaryaatmak aakaar ko kaary binduon kii sankhya main abhivyakt karata he 
 There are many benefits to using action points and functional shape can be used for many types of projects and organization decisions such as: kai sanghathan alag alag alag shuddhta str tak kaary binduon ko napate hai, yah is par nirbhar he ki tantrash kaa aakaar antat kis uddeshy se napa ja rahaa he
 FPA can also be used to detect the test effort of an information system; its formula is test case = 1
2 kaary binduon ke jariye kaaryatmak paripekshya se pranaaliyon ko mapa jaataa he
 There is no difference in the technique used
 bhashaa, vikaas vidhi yaa yantransh jo bhi ho, kisi pranali ke kaary binduon kii sankhya nahin badalegi
 If changed, the effort involved in building only those action points
 kaarysambandhi prayokta aavashyaktaayen do prakaar kii hai - saamagree kaary va len del kaary
 These are divided into 5 types by the IFPUG and NESMA FSM methods and based on these, points of action are provided
 saamagree kaary → aantarik taarkik filein: prayokta maanya, taarkik rup se sambandhit saamagree kaa samooh udhaaharan : karmchaaree fil main sanchit karmchaaree saamagree 
 Content Work → External Interface Files: Logically related content, for reference only, content remains outside the application
 bahya antaraprishth fil kisi anya fil ke liye aantarik taarkik fil hogi
 Example: Content shared by a company outside its system
 lenden kaary → bahya aadan: baahar se saamagree praapt kar ke aantarik taarkik fil main sanjona
 Examples - adding users, adding employees
 is len dein main saamagree kaa jo manyakaran hota he vah bahya aadan nahin he
 For example, postal registration is not an external exchange by itself
 isamen kai len dein hai jaise ki dak pate kii pushti, dak pate kii uplabdhta jaanchna or saamagree jamaa karnaa
 Only the eventual submission of material is external input
 baaki sab bahya prashn honge
 Transaction Functions → External Render: In this the internal material goes out and this material is the post received material
 udhaaharan: kar gananaa, aay gananalenden kaary → bahya prashn: bahya saamagree andar aati he par yah aantarik taarkik filon main sanjoyi nahin jaati he
 Internal content goes out but without any calculation
 udhaaharan: atm main jaanchna ki kitne paise hai, ek prashn ke jariye karmchaaree kii jaankaree praapt karnaa
 There has been criticism of work points and many other system measurements, that its benefits are far less than the costs and intricacies of using it
 kaary binduon kii gananaa karne main lage prayaas kaa keval aanshik truti ghataav he, kuch is vajah se ki tantransh kii laagat ke andaaze main bhinnata kaa adhikansh iske tahat aata hi nahin he (jaise ki vyapaar main badlaav, seemaa main badlaav, aniojit sansaadhan simittaayen yaa praathamiktaaon main badlaav aadi
 Also, if using this measure to decide whether to invest in this mechanism or not, it is argued that the benefit of the policy should be measured rather than the cost
 anuprayukt soochna arthshaastra, jo in maapon ke aarthik mulyon kii gananaa karata he, aksar prayoktaaon ke maapan kaa prayaas anya muddon main kharch karne ko prerit karata he

 In fact, in the commercial mortgage sectors, many investment banks leverage losses at the leading interest rate to earn from the securitization of those loans, as a result, it has become a very popular financing option for commercial property investors and developers

 Prithviraj Raso is an epic written in Hindi language describing the life and character of Prithviraj Chauhan
 iske rachayita raav chand bardaai bhatta jo chandisa raav ke kaladi gautra se the va prithviraj ke bachapan ke mitra or unke raajakavi the or unki yuddh yatraaon ke samay vir ras kii kavitaaon se sena ko protsaahit bhi karte the
 Between 1165 and 1192 when Prithviraj Chauhan's kingdom extended from Ajmer to Delhi
 prithvirajraso dhai hajaar prishthon kaa bahut bada granth he jisamen 69 samay hai
 Almost all the verses practiced in ancient times have been treated in it
 mukhya chand hai - kavitt, duha, tomars, trotak, gaha or aryaa
 Just as it is famous with respect to Kadambari that the previous part of it has been completed by the son of Baan Bhatt, similarly the previous part of Raso has also been completed by Chand's son Jalahan
 raso ke anusaar jab shahabuddin gori prithviraj ko kaid karke gazani le gaya, tab kuch dinon peeche chand bhi vahiin gaye
 While leaving, the poet gave the book of Raso in the hands of his son Jalahan and indicated to complete it
 jalhan ke haath main raso ko saunpe jane or uske puure kiye jane kaa ullekh raso main he - Many scholars doubt Prithvirajasso's contemporary poetry as being written in the 16th century, due to the disproportion of the texts given in Raso with historical facts in many places
 is rachana kii sabase puraani prati bikaner ke rajkeey pustkaalay me mili he kul 3 pratiyaan he
 At the end of the composition Prithviraj has also talked about killing Gauri by running a piercing arrow
 prithvirajraso raasak parampara kaa ek kavy he
 As its name suggests, a Hindi treatise written about the events of the life of Prithviraj, the last Hindu emperor of Delhi, is believed to be written by Rao Chandravadai Bhatt
 pehle is kavy ke ek hi rup se hindi jagat parichit tha, jo sanyog se rachana kaa sabase adhik vishaal rup tha isamen lagbhag gyaarah hajaar roopak aate the
 After that a smaller version of the composition was found in some copies, which had about three and a half thousand metaphors
 uske bhi baad ek rup kuch pratiyon main praapt hua jisamen kul rupaksankhya baarah sau se adhik nahin thi
 Subsequently, two copies were also received which had only four hundred and five and a half hundred metaphors respectively
 ye sabhi pratiyaan rachana ke vibhinn purna rup prastut karti thim
 Copies of some volumes of the composition have also been received, which are related to the first two forms mentioned above
 at: swabhaavat: yah vivaad uthaa ki uparyukt vibhinn purna roopon kaa vikaas kis prakaar hua
 Some scholars differed completely from this
 unhone kaha ki sabase bada rup hi rachana kaa mul rup rahaa hoga or usee se uttarottar adhikadhik chote rup sankshepon ke rup main banaakar prastut kiye gaye honge
 He gave the proof that no form of creation, even the smallest form, is free from antiquity
 kintu is vivaad ko phir yaheen par chhod diya gaya or isko hal karne kaa koi prayaas bahut dinon tak nahin kiya gaya
 Its first notable attempt was in 1955
 jab ek vidwaan ne prithviraj raso ke teen paathon kaa aakaar sambandh sheershak lekh likar yah dikhaaya ki prithviraj or uske vipaksh ke balaabal ko suchit karanevaali jo sankhyaayein rachana ke teen vibhinn paathon : sabase bade, usase chote or usase bhi chote main milti hai unamem samanta nahin he or yadi samgr rup se dekha jaay to in sankhyaon ke sambandh main atyukti kii maatra bhi uparyukt kram main hi uttarottar kam milti he
 If these texts had developed in the order of the greater medium, there would have been no difference in the numerical numbers due to the abbreviated verb
 isaliye yah prakat he ki praapt roopon ke vikaas kaa kram laghutmalaghumadhyambrihat he
 From the point of view of management, if we pay attention to the rhyme series and rhyme chains and context series, we will also see that these series are progressively broken in the shortest order of the shortest order and are kept in between by more and more verses and context trajectories
 kintu rachana kaa praapt sabase chota rup bhi in shrinkhalatrutiyon se sarvatha mukt nahin he, isaliye spasht gyaat hota he ki 'raso' kaa mul rup praapt laghutam rup se bhi chota rahaa hoga
 The story of 'prithvirajasso' is summarized as follows: At the time when Prithviraj was on the throne of Delhi, King Jayachand of Kannauj decided to perform a Rajasuya Yajna and on this occasion he also resolved to perform the swayamvara of his daughter Samyukrita
 rajasuya kaa nimantran usne dur dur tak ke raajaaon ko bheja or prithviraj ko bhi usamen sammilit hone ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Prithviraj and his feudatories were persuaded that, despite the verses, some other Rajasuya would perform a yagna and Prithviraj declined Jayachand's invitation
 jayachand ne phir bhi rajasuya yajna karnaa thaanakar yagyamandap ke dwaar par dwarpal ke rup main prithviraj kii ek pratimaa sthapit kar di
 Prithviraj was naturally angry at this incident as an insult
 isi bich use yah bhi samachar mila ki jayachand kii kanya sanyogita ne pita ke vachanon kii upeksha kar prithviraj ko hi pati rup main varan karne kaa sankalp kiya he or jayachand ne isapar cruddh hokar use alag gangatatavarti ek awaas main bhijwa diya he
 Satisfied with these news, he was somehow spending his time outside the capital in the game that his minister Kavas, taking advantage of his absence, had an inappropriate relationship with one of his Karnati maids and one day entered his chamber at night
 pattarai ko jab yah baat gyaat hui, usne prithviraj ko tatkaal bulavaa bheja or prithviraj raat ko hi do ghadiyon main rajbhavan main aa gaya
 When he was shown to Kavas in the said maid's chamber, he aimed them in the dark of night and released the arrows
 pehla baan to chook gaya kintu duusare baan ke lagate hi kainvas dharashayi ho gaya
 At night, Prithviraj went to the game after getting both of them buried in a pit, then returned to the capital the next day
 kainvas kii stri ne chand se apane mrit pati kaa shav dilaane kii prarthana kii to chand ne prithviraj se yah nivedan kiya
 Prithviraj accepted Chand's request on the condition that he would take Kannauj with him
 donon mitra kasakar gale milte ore roe
 Prithviraj said that it was good to die from this humiliating life and his poet approved this sentiment
 kainvas kaa shav lekar uski vidhwaa sati ho gai
 Prithviraj traveled to Kannauj in the remainder of Thawaitt with Chand
 saath main sau vir rajput saamanton sainikon ko bhi usne le liya
 After reaching Kannauj, he went to the court of Jaichand
 jayachand ne uskaa bahut satkar kiya or usase prithviraj ke vay, rup aadi ke sambandh main poocha
 Chand gave some description of him, Jaichand was shocked to see his follower Thawaitt
 shankaanivaranarth usne kavi ko paan arpit karaane ke bahaane anya daasiyon ke saath ek daasi ko bulaayaa jo pehle prithviraj kii seva main rah chuki thi
 He covered Prithviraj on seeing Thwaitt in disguise
 kintu kisi ne kaha ki chand prithviraj kaa abhinn sakha tha isaliye daasi ne use dekh sir dhank liya or baat vahiin par samaapt ho gai
 But on the next morning, when Jaichand went to meet Chand at his camp, he was again suspicious to see Thavitta sitting on the throne
 chand ne bahaane karke uski shankaa kaa nivaaran karnaa chaha or thawitt se use paan arpit karne kaa kaha
 The whirlwind Vrithi Prithviraj threw while drinking, convinced Jaichand that he was Prithviraj himself and took orders to confront Prithviraj
 idhar prithviraj nagar kii parikrama ke liye niklaa
 As he was sucking pearls to the fishes in the Ganges, Sanyogita sent a maid to identify her properly and make her love when she was Prithviraj
 daasi ne jab yah nishchay kar liya ki vah prithviraj hi he, usne sanyogita kaa pranaynivedan kiya
 Prithviraj met Sankrita later and both of them entered the Gangesathar residence
 us samay vah vahaan se chalaa aayaa kintu apane saamanton ke kehane par vah pun: jaanakar sanyogita kaa saath liva laayaa
 When he kidnapped this type of Sanyogita, Chand defiantly told Jaichand that his enemy Prithviraj was now asking for war in the form of mercy by announcing his daughter
 parinamat: donon pakshon main sangharsh prarambh ho gaya
 In a two-day war when many of Prithviraj's warriors were killed, the feudals advised him to change the mode of war
 unhone sujhaayaa ki vah sanyogita ko lekar dilli kii ore bade or ve jayachand kii sena ko dilli ke maarg main aage badhane se rokte rahen jab tak vah sanyogita ko lekar dilli na pahunch jaae
 Prithviraj accepted this and the sacrifice of many feudal and heroic warriors went to Delhi with endless coincidence
 jayachand apni sena ke saath kannauj laut gaya
 Arriving in Delhi, Prithviraj, along with Sanyogita, became delirious
 chah maheene tak awaas se baahar niklaa hi nahin, jiske parinamswaroop uske guru, bandhav, bhaty tathaa lok main uske prati asantosh utpann ho gaya
 When the subjects requested the Rajguru to suffer, Rajguru went to Sanyogita's residence with Chand
 donon ne milakar prithviraj ko gori ke akraman kii soochika patrika bheji or sandeshvahika daasi se kahala bheja : 'gori rattatuadhara tu gori anuratt
 'the king's luxury sleep was disturbed and he left for battle by chance
 shahabuddin is baar badi baari sena lekar aayaa hua tha
 Many of Prithviraj's brave warriors and feudal Kannos were killed in the war itself
 parinamat: prithviraj kii sena rankshetra se laut padi or shahbuddin vijayi hua
 Prithviraj was imprisoned and taken to Ghazni
 vahaan par kuch dinon baad shahabuddin ne uski ankhen nikalava leen
 When news of the sufferings of Chand Prithviraj came, that Ghajini went under the control of Avadhoot for the salvation of his friend and master
 vah shahabuddin se mila
 On asking the reason for going there, he told that now he wanted to go to Badarikashram and do penance, but one sadness was remaining in his life, so he had not yet gone there
 usne prithviraj ke saath janm grahan kiya tha or ve bachapan main saath saath hi khele koode the
 At the same time, Prithviraj told him that he could pierce seven gongs at once with the help of Singini without any fruit
 uskaa yah kaushal vah nahin dekh sakaa tha or ab dekhakar apni vah saadh puri karnaa chahta tha
 Ghori said that he has been blinded
 chand ne kaha ki vah phir bhi vaisaa sandhanakaushal dikhaa saktaa he, use yah vishwaas tha
 Shahabuddin accepted this demand and got all the arrangements made
 chand ke protsaahit karne par jivan se niraash prithviraj ne bhi apana sanghan kaushal dikhaane ke bahaane shatru ke vadh karne kaa uskaa aagrah sweekaar kar liya
 With approval from Prithviraj, Chand went to Shahabuddin and said that he was ready to do the goal only if he himself called for three times Lakshwadeh with his mouth
 shahabuddin ne ise bhi sweekaar kar liya1 shah ne do farmaan die, phir teesraa usne jyon hi diya prithviraj ke baan se viddh hokar vah dharashayi hua
 Prithviraj also came to an end
 devataaon ne us par pushpavrishti kii or prithvi ne mlechha gori se traan paakar harsh prakat kiya
 Here the story of 'prithvirajasso' ends
 'raso' kii aitihaasikta ko lekar, vishesh rup se jab se prasiddh vidvan or puraatatvajna vular ko 'prithviraj vijay' naamak sanskrit kavy kii khandit prati mili, bada vivaad chalaa he
 This dispute has been raised about its larger text, but it is not even the shortest text of the composition that is completely free from antiquity
 udaahranarth jayachand ke dwaara daahal ke karn ko do baar parajeet or bandi kiye jane kaa ullekh miltaa he, kintu vah jayachand se lagbhag sava sau varsh purv hua tha
 No definite historical support has yet been received in connection with the battle of Prithviraj said to Jaichand
 prithviraj ajmer kaa shaasha tha; dilli kaa shaasha koi govindaray yaa khanderay tha jo prithviraj kii ore se donon yudhon se ladaa tha ore duusare yuddh main maaraa gaya tha
 According to Muslim historians, Prithviraj had only two wars with Ghori, according to 'raso' there were at least four sons, out of which three Shahabuddin were defeated and imprisoned
 musalmaan itihaaskaaron ke anusaar prithviraj parajeet hone ke ananthar saraswati ke nikat pakadaa gaya or maaraa gaya tha, jabaki 'raso' ke anusaar vah shhabuddin ko gazani main uparyukt prakaar se markar mara tha
 These historical references and descriptions are found in all the forms of 'prithvirajasso' and most of them belong to its weft, so will be found in any of its reconstructed forms
 isaliye yah maananaa hi padegaa ki uskaa koi bhi rup prithviraj kii samakaleen rachana nahin ho saktaa he
 The question is that what time can 'raso' be considered a creation
 kuch samay hua, prasiddh anveshi vidvan muni jinvijay ko jain bhandaron main do 'jain prabandh' sangrahon kii ek ek prati mili, jinamein 'prithviraj prabandh' or 'jayachand prabandh' sakalit the
 Some of the verses quoted in these arrangements were also found in 'prithviraj Raso', although the language of these quotes was more secure in antiquity than the language of 'raso'
 donon pratiyon main 'prithviraj prabandh' praaia: abhinn tha or ek prabandhsangrah kii prati san
 1528 kii thi
 From this, Muniji deduced that Chand was definitely a contemporary of Prithviraj and his royalty
 kintu itane se hi yah parinaam nikaalan tarksammat na hoga
 On the basis of these facts, we can only say that Chand received some form of composition before the year 1528, from which those verses are quoted in the above 'prithvirajaprabandh'
 vah rup san
 1528 ke kitne purv nirmit hua hoga iske sambandh main kuch anumaan se hi kaha ja saktaa he, jiske liye nimnlikhit aadhaar liye ja sakate hai : One of the verses quoted is not found in copies of the short text of 'raso' in which Canvas is called 'vyas' and Vasishtha, while all the forms of 'raso' give an account of his undue love with the Carnatic maid, It is evident from the fact that the original author, the author of the above verses, was proclaimed; The original form of the composition should also precede it
 yadi maan liya jaay ki rachana kaa ukt prakshipt rup uske mul rup ke lagbhag 50 varsh baad kaa hoga, aadharbhoot purvaj sangrah uske bhi lagbhag 25 varsh baad taiyaar kiye gaye honge or praapt pratiyaan ukt donon prabandhsangrahon ke taiyaar hone ke bhi lagbhag pachis varsh baad kii hongi, to mul kavyrachana san
 1400 ke lagbhag kii maani ja sakati he
 There is no leniency in this estimate of time, so the date of the original composition cannot be postponed much later
 rachana kii bhashaa kaa jo rup prabandhsangrahon ke udaahranon main tathaa rachana ke laghutam roopon kii pratiyon main miltaa he, vah bhi san
 1400 ke aas paas kaa gyaat hota he, isaliye bhashaa kaa sakshya bhi uparyukt parinaam kii pushti karata he
 'prithvirajasso' is the best Hindi poetry of Veer Ras
 hindi sahitya main vir charitron kii jaisi vishad kalpana is kavy main mili waisi baad main kabhi nahin dikhaai padi
 The reader flows throughout the composition in an overflowing stream of excitement
 kannauj yuddh ke purv sanyogita ke anuraag or virah tathaa ukt yuddh ke ananthar prithviraj sanyogita ke milan or keli vilaas ke jo chitra rachana main milte hai, ve atyant aakarshak hai
 Other juices are also not lacking in poetry
 rachana kaa varnanavaibhav asaadhaaran he; nayak nayika ke sambhog samay kaa shadritu varnan kahin kahin par sanshlisht prakrutichitran ke sundar udhaaharan prastut karata he
 The language style is effective everywhere and varies throughout the poetry according to the subject
 rachana ke in samast gunon par drushtipaat kiya jaae to vah ek sundar mahakavy pramanit hota he or ni:andeh aadhunik bhartiya aryabhasha sahitya ke aadi yug kii vishisht kriti thaharti he

 Definitions of the period vary widely, and partly for this reason, many historians now refrain from using the term
 adhiktar prayog hone vaale pehali paribhaasha main europea madhya yug ki tarah is kaal ko chhathi shatabdi se lekar solahavin shatabdi tak mana jaataa he
 It can be divided into two periods: the 'early medieval period' from the 6th to the 13th century and the 'last medieval period' which lasted from the 13th to the 16th century, and ended in 1526 with the beginning of the Mughal Empire

 In an alternative definition, which can be seen in the use of more recent authors, the beginning of the medieval period is further extended to the 10th or 12th century

 He was eventually selected in the final 14 for the Test series against Pakistan in 1999, but could not make it to the final 11

 In the 2003–04 home series against the Indian batting line-up, which ended in a 1–1 draw for Australia, Lee was ruled out of the first two Tests, recovering from an abdominal injury torn during the Zimbabwe series
 us charan par, lee ne aanshik rup se 'peeche ke takhnon ke takaraav' kaa aanshik rup se ilaaj karwaane ke liye shalya chikitsa, jo ek aisi sthiti thi jise lee zimbabwe ke khilaaf test series se pehle se hi bhugat rahe the or saath hi fatty hui pet kii mansapeshiyon main sudhaar ke liye surgery karaane kaa nirnay liya, lekin lee apane takhne kii chot se puri tarah ubar nahin paae or antat srilanka ke khilaaf ghayal ho gaye

42, compared to an average of 16
07 early in his career

 Despite his high bowling average in the series, he was regarded as one of Australia's best players alongside leg-spinner Shane Warne and batsman Justin Langer
 mcgra ko chot ke saath hi saath
 Part of Lee's difficulties at the test level is that his high speed advantage, which gives batsmen less time to react, also results in more uncertain bowling
 haal ke dinon main ve gati ko kam karte hue keval sateekta par dhyaan kendrit karne kii koshish main lage hai
 During his first Test at the Gabba against the West Indies in late 2005, following the announcement that he would focus on 'line and length' while sacrificing his pace, his new bowling approach failed in the first innings
 , On the advice of his captain Ricky Ponting, Lee returned to his early style of bowling
 This resulted in his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests by 5 / 30, the first time in four years
 2005-06 australian cricket sizan main, 2001-04 kii pareshaaniyon ko raahat dete hue lee ke test aankadon main sudhaar aayaa, jab sizan kii gendbaazi kaa ausat 25

 He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year
 jab australia ne ek do test shrinkhalaa ke liye bangladesh kaa daura kiya, tab ve apane pradarshan ko banaae rakhane main asamarth rahe, jahaan unhone 93 ranon par do wicket lete hue australia kii gendbaazi ausat main sabase neeche aa gaye
 In the 2006–07 Ashes series, Lee was widely criticized for his poor form of bowling
 pehle teen test maichon main unhone keval aath wicket liye or adelaide ke tisare test main bahut zyaada apil ke liye jurmaana kiya gaya, jab LBW kaa nirnay unke paksh main nahin tha
 But during the week-long period between Adelaide and Melbourne Tests, he worked with Australian bowling coach Try Cooley to adjust his run-up and return with more wickets in the fourth and final Test
 unhone 20 viketon ke saath shrinkhalaa kaa samaapan kiya, jahaan unki behtareen gendbaazi ke aankade the 33

 unke pradarshan ko anya teen pramukh australian gendbaajon ne behatar kiya: 26 viketon ke saath stuart clark, 23 viketon ke saath shen warn or 21 wicket ke saath glen maikgra unase aage the
 However, in the 2006 / 07 Ashes series, Lee was ahead of the fourth highest wicket-taker of all English bowlers
 yah us shrinkhalaa main australia kii vijay ko pratibimbit karata he or yah tathy bhi ki australia ko aksar do puri pari kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, basharte ki angreji gendbaajon ko kam avasar diya jaae
 Many wondered how Lee would lead the pace attack following the retirement of Glenn mcgrath and Shane Warne, one of the greatest bowlers of all time
 lekin unhone chunauti kaa saamana kiya or 2007 ke ant main srilanka ke khilaaf do test ke udghaatan warn-muralidharan trophy shrinkhalaa main main of da series puraskaar se sammanit kiye gaye

 unhone alan border padak jeet kar sizan ko sajaayaa, jo vigat varsh australia ke sarvshereshth antarrashtriya cricketer ghoshit kiye gaye khilaadi ko puraskaar swaroop diya jaataa he
 Lee's performance in the 2008 Australian tour of the West Indies did not remain hopeful, where he took just 5 wickets in the first Test, during which he looked tired
 duusare test main unki kshamta main nikhaar aayaa, jab unhone aath wicket hasil kiye, jisamen 5 viketon kii jeet or tisare test match main 6 shaamil he
 Overall, as the series progressed, they began to appear on the farm, but were often tired of the extra workload; While the other bowlers were struggling with form and fitness problems
 bhartiya daure ke samay lee ke pet main virus ne hamalaa kiya or puri shrinkhalaa main ve apana behtareen farm hasil karne main asamarth rahe
 Lee showed his best form when the team returned to Australia for a two-test series with New Zealand, but the pace usually seemed to go down
 However, he struggled in the two Tests he played with South Africa, which Australia lost 2–1, possibly due to an ankle injury and then a stress fracture developed during the series
 boxing de test match kii duusari pari ke dauraan puri tarah asthibhang hua, jiske baad lee ne apane takhne or pair ke ilaaj ke liye surgery karwaai or das saptaah tak khel se baahar rahane kii sambhaavna bani
 By the time he returned to the Australian team for the Ashes in 2009, he was replaced by Mitchell Johnson as the pioneer
 iske atirikt, peter sidle, ben hillfenhas or do bowllinger jaise gendbaajon ke aagaman ne yah sunishchit kiya ki lee ko team main sthaan ke liye sangharsh karnaa hoga
 However, he took six wickets in the first innings of a practice match against the England Lions team before the Ashes

 Nevertheless, he suffered left-back strain and ribs in this match and was not included in the first three Tests
 baad main unhen khel main dubaara shaamil karne ke liye andekha kiya gaya or antim do test maichon main unhone nahin khelaa
 Lee made his debut in a one-day international game for Australia against Pakistan on 9 January 2000 during the Carlton and United Breweries series in Gaba, Brisbane
 ve australia kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale 140wein ODI cricketer bane
 In one-day internationals, Lee is widely regarded as one of the finest and most feared bowlers in the world, having been named the No
 1 ODI bowler by the ICC in January 2006 and the top ten ODI bowlers since early 2003
 Are included in
 unke paas vyapak deliveriyon kaa prabhaavshaalee samooh he, jisamen ek khatarnaak in-swinging yorker bhi shaamil he
 His bowling strike rate around 30 puts him in the most intense class in this form of the game
 kenya ke khilaaf 2003 ke vishwa cap main hasil ek-divasiy antarrashtriya hat-trick bhi unheen ke naam he
 Lee is the first Australian and fourth bowler to achieve this feat in World Cup history
 2005-06 trikoniya ek divasiy shrinkhalaa main australia dwaara khele gaye maichon main, lee ne duusare khel main maaikel hasi ke saath 100 ran kii bhagidaari main 57 banane ke saath australia ko madhyam kram dhahne se hone vaali pareshaani se baahar nikaalte hue, apane upyogi ballebaazi kshamta kaa pradarshan kiya
 However, he is yet to contribute with his batting consistently and his current ICC ranking hovers around 90–100
 lee ne shrinkhalaa kii samaapti 15 wicket lekar kii, jo nathan braken or muthaiya muralidharan ke peeche teesri ucchtam sankhya he
 While Lee's average and strike rate in odis rank him as one of the best strike bowlers in the history of odis, he can still bowl indefinitely, as demonstrated by his relatively high economy rate
 it happens
 lee main pari kii shuruuaat main hi wicket lene kii kshamta hasil he, jahaan aksar ve pari ke pehle over main hi ballebaajon ko hataa dete hai
 The ball he bowled to Marwan Atapattu in the semi-finals of the 2003 Cricket World Cup final reached 160

 He has stated that he wants to be an all-rounder, although this is not his main priority
 2005 eshez shrinkhalaa ke dauraan lee ne kai uddand pari kheli or ek ballebaaj ke rup main vishwaas dilaayaa
 Lee's aggressive style and strong physique often garnered several sixes, including the one that flew out in a 2005 Test match against the West Indies at the Gabba, recognized as the biggest six on that ground
 
 2 april 2006 ko, lee ne johanisburg main dakshin africa ke khilaaf 68 gendon main apana sarvaadhik test score 64 maaraa
 unka test main pichhlaa sarvaadhik score 62 naat out tha, jo unhone gaba main west indies ke khilaaf banaaya tha
 Lee almost crossed this mark against India on 3 January 2008, when he scored 59 runs from 121 balls
 lee ne ek baar phir lagbhag apane sarvaadhik test score ko paar kar hi liya, jab unhone 63 naat out kaa score banaaya tha, lekin durbhagyavash riki ponting ne west indies ke khilaaf duusare test match main pari kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 As a result, he was one run behind his highest test score

 Dirt is either collected by dustbags or by cyclones for later disposal
 1860 main sanyukt rajya america ke west union ke iova ke dainiel hes ne ek vacum clinar kaa avishkaar kiya
 Instead of calling it a vacuum sweeper, he called it a carpet cleaner, in fact, his machine had a rotating brush as in conventional vacuum cleaners, with a large blower on the top end of the device to pull out dust and dirt
 10 june 1860 ko hes ne apane avishkrut vacum clinar ke liye paintent praapt kiya
 The first manual hand cleaner used the principle of "tornado", invented in 1868 by Ives W
 of Chicago, USA
 mcgafe did
 vrlavind mashin halki or chote aakaar kii thi, lekin parichaalan main kathin thi, kyonki ise ghumaane ke saath hi saath ek hi haath se ise puure farsh par bhi chalaanaa padataa tha
 On June 8, 1869, mcgaffay obtained a patent for the device and listed it with the help of The American Carpet Cleaning Company of Boston to be sold publicly
 25 dollar main ise bech diya gaya
 It is difficult to determine how successful the tornado was, as most of it was sold in Chicago and Boston and it is believed that in 1871 most of it was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire
 gyaat rup se keval do hi batch paae, inamen se ek ko hover historical centre main dekha ja saktaa he
 mcgafe was one of the inventors who invented the manual vacuum cleaner in the United States and Europe in the 19th century
 vidyutchalit "karpet sweepar and dust gaidarar" ke rup main pehle-pahal ise patent karaayaa gaya or disambar 1900 main jarjia ke savana ke corine dufor ne ise manjuuri di
 In 1876, Melville Bissell of Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA, made a vacuum cleaner for his wife, Ana, to clean the wood sawdust from the carpet
 iske turant baad, bicel karpet sweepar aayaa
 After Melville's sudden death in 1889, Ann took control of the company and she became one of the most powerful business women in the world
 1901 main pehle motorchalit vacum clinar ke avishkaar kaa shrey aamtaur par hubert cesil booth ko jaataa he, haalanki isse do saal pehle 1899 main america ke mizori sthit saint louis ke jon tharman ne darasal, motorchalit vacum clinar kaa avishkaar kar liya tha
 Booth saw a display of an instrument blowing dust from chairs in trains and thought it would be far more useful to pull the dust away
 unhone ek restaraan kii kursi par ek roomaal daalkar iskaa pareekshan kiya, unhone roomaal main apana munh rakhaa or phir jitna adhik ho sake dhul khinchne kii unhone koshish kii
 Seeing dust and dirt accumulate on the underside of the handkerchief, he realized that his idea could work

 ise ghodon dwaara khinchaa jaataa tha or saaf karne ke liye imaarat ke baahar khadaa kiya jaataa tha
 Booth started the British Vacuum Cleaner Company and refined his invention over the next several decades

 e
 phiskar ne ek vacum clinar kaa patent apni company ke telegram pate—nifisk ke naam par karaayaa
 europe main yah pehla bijli se chalanevaala vacum clinar tha
 It was built in a design weighing just 17
5 kg, which could be operated by a single person
 kuch saal pehle hi phiskar and nilsan company kaa gathan hua tha
 These days Nifisk Vacuum is distributed by nilfisk-advance
 1905 main "kaaleen se dhul hataane ke liye griffith kaa unnat vacum upkaran" manual tareeke se chalaaya janevaala ek anya clinar tha, jise walter griffith manufacturer, birmingham, england dwaara patent karaayaa gaya tha
 It was portable, easy to keep and could be run by "anyone"
 isamen lage ek dhaunkani jaise yantra kaa kaam dabaav daalane kaa tha
 Dust was extracted through a removable flexible pipe, into which spouts of different sizes could be fitted
 yakeenan yah pehla gharelu vacum clinar upkaran tha, jo aadhunik vacum clinar se kaaphi miltaa-julata tha
 Between 1903 and 1913, USA inventor David T
 Kennedy was granted nine patents to establish the American vacuum cleaner industry
 1919 main gathit vacum clinar manuphactures association kii sadsyta keval unheen tak simit thi, jo unke patenton ke tahat licensadhari the
 In 1907, James Murray Spangler, a watchman in Cantone, Ohio, USA, invented the first practical portable vacuum cleaner
 yah mahatvapurn baat he, electric pankhe, ek box or apni patni ke takie ke khol main istemaal honevaale sacshan ko spangler dwaara dizin kii gayi kachra khaali karne ke liye ek ghoomanevaale brush se joda gaya
 Unable to produce the design due to lack of funds, he sold it in 1908 to William Henry Hoover, who redesigned the Spangler's machine with steel coverings, castings and attachments
 baad main aane vaale navtpaada main 1920 ke dashak kaa pehla dispojable filter bag or 1926 kaa pehla sidhaa khadaa honevaala vacum clinar shaamil hai
 On 2 June 1908, Spangler made a painting of his rotating brush and eventually sold the idea to his niece's husband, Hoover
 ve ek nae utpaada ko bechney kii jugad main the, kyonki automobile ke kshetra main avishkaar ke kaaran unki 'hover hernes and ledar guds' company vilupti ke kagaar par ja rahi thi
 In the United States, Hoover has been one of the leading manufacturers of household items, including vacuum cleaners; And Hoover became very wealthy because of this invention
 vastav main, britain main hover kaa naam vacum clinar kaa itnaa bada paryaay ban gaya ki "harek kii kaaleen hover kii" jaisi sthiti ban gayi
 Initially called 'the Electric Suction Sweeper Company', their first Vacuum o model arrived in 1908, which sold for $ 60
 ek anokhe vacum clinar ke liye hover bhi ullekhneey he, constlation hover ek canstar vaala vacum clinar he, lekin isamen pahiyaa nahin hota he
 Instead, the vacuum cleaner flows on its clearance and operates like a hovercraft, although this is not the case in older models
 isamen upar ke sire main ek ghoomanevaali nalee is abhipraay se lagi hoti thi ki upyogkarta kamare ke centre main ikai ko rakhkar prachaalit karegaa or clinar ke aasapaas kaam karegaa
 The Canister Vacuum Cleaner, introduced in 1952, is collectible and easily recognizable due to its rounded shape
 ye bahut shor karte the, safai kii kshamta kam thi or kaaleen ke upar yah nahin chal saktaa tha
 But they became an interesting machine; They are used, work well in homes with hard wood floors
 constlation ko badal die gaye the or 1975 main band ho jane se pehle pichley kuch varshon tak adhyatan kiye gaye
 The constellation routes of all these exhausts under vacuum use different airfoils
 adhyatan dizin aadhunik maanakon se kaaphi milte-julate hai, kyonki vishesh kar kaaleen par honevaali aawaaj ko ye dabaa dete hai
 These models float on carpet or on bare floors - rather hard floors, so that the expelled air is scattered on any surface or around the waste
 ab hover ko yues main baad ke constlation model model main ek adhyatan sanskaran ke saath phir se relies kiya gaya he
 a HEPA filtering bag, which included a 12 ampere motor, a suction turbine that rotates the brush with electricity to the floor, incorporated the change and redesigned its handle, which was about to break
 isi model ko metaig brands ke tahat euke main satellite ke naam se vipanan kiya gaya, kyonki iskaa license pratibandhit tha
 The old US unit had a suctionable 5
2 ampere motor, but not all of them had a motorized brush
 isliye ve aam taur par sakht farsh par yaa chote kalinon par behatar kaam karte hai
 The older units are Hoover-like j paper bags, but these smaller types of s allergen filtering bags can be easily cut and fitted to the old vacuum food
 yues hover se pratisthaapan motors abhi bhi kuch modelon ke liye uplabdh hai
 In 1973, Hoover created another model of air circulating vacuum cleaner called Celebrity
 iskaa chapata aakaar "udan tashtaree" jaisaa he
 Wheels have been added to the hoover to make the traditional canister model like a circling vacuum after a short run
 yah ech kism ke bag kaa upyog karata he
 Initial vacuum cleaners used to be heavy standing units and could not be moved easily
 lekin 1921 main electrolux model ve lekar aayaa, jise do patale dhaatu ke chalaaya janevaale ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 The innovation was conceived by Electrolux founder Axel wener-gren, becoming a standard feature for future generation vacuum cleaners
 70 saalon tak 1930 ke dashak ke electrolux vacum clinar ke istemaal hone kaa record tha or antat: 2008 main yah tut gaya
 The vacuum cleaner remained as a luxurious item until many years after its arrival; But after World War II, they became common among the middle classes
 pashchimi deshon main ye kahin adhik chalan main aa gaye, kyonki duniya ke jyadatar hisson main, diwaar se diwaar tak kaaleen bichaaya janaa or gharon main tile yaa sakht lakdi ke farsh asaamaanya hai, jisamen aasaani se buhaaraa, jhaadu yaa poncha lagaaya jaataa he
 Vacuum cleaners Vacuum cleaners operating on the principle of cyclones became popular in the 1990s, although some companies have been making cyclone activator vacuum cleaners since 1928
 1985 main british diziner james dyson dwaara aadhunik chakravaati clinar ko audyogic aadhunik chakravaati vibhaajak se roopantarit kiya gaya
 In the 1980s he launched the Cyclone Cleaner for the first time in Japan for US $ 1,800 and later in 1993 directly launched the Dyson DC01 for 200 pounds in the UK
 ummid yah thi ki log ek aam vacum clinar kii tulana main duguni keemat dekar koi vacum clinar nahin kharidenge, lekin baad main yah euke main sabase adhik lokapriy vacum clinar ban gaya
 Bags are used in cyclonic cleaners, instead dust collects in a round container that is fit to be separated
 bhavar kaa nirmaan karte hue paatr kii diwaar kii taraf sparsharekha kii disha main hawa or dhul tej gati se udakar paatr main ikattha hoti he
 Gravity is the cause of dust particles and other waste where they fall by centrifugal force and clean air comes out of the machine from the center of the vortex through a series of fine filters in the upper part of the vessel
 
 pehla filter un kanon ko roak letaa he jo iske peeche lage filter ko, jo or bhi adhik maheen dhul ko hataata he, nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Filters should be cleaned or replaced regularly to ensure that the machine continues to operate effectively
 dyson ke baad hower samet kai anya companiyaan chakravaati model lekar aayin or tab ek paaramparik clinar kii tulana main sabase sasta model bhi mahangaa nahin rahaa
 In early 2000, several companies developed robotic "vacuum" cleaners
 iske kuch udhaaharan hai rumba, robomax, intelebot, trilobite or florbot 
 ye mashine puure farsh par ek pattern main apane aap main aage badhati he, sataha kii dhul ko saaf karti or kachare ko apane kachare ke dabbe main daalati he
 They can usually move around the furniture and resume their work
 zyaadaatar robot vaale "vacum" clinar kaa dizin ghar par upyog ke liye kiya jaataa he, haalanki daftaron, hotalon, aspataalon aadi main parichalaan ke liye or adhik sakasham model hai
 For example, some rumbas are equipped with impeller motors to produce the original vacuum
 2003 ke ant tak duniya bhar main lagbhag 570,000 ikaiyaan bikin thim
 In 2004 a British company released the Aider, a forward-facing vacuum cleaner that floats on the upper surface of the cushion
 daawa kiya jaataa he ki vajan main yah halkaa or kaushal main aasaan hota he, haalanki aisa karanevaala yah pehla vacum clinar nahin he - kam se kam 35 saalon purana he hower kanstlation
 Pulling of a vacuum is caused by a difference in air pressure
 ek bijli kaa pankhaa mashin ke andar dabaav kam kar detaa he
 Atmospheric pressure then pushes the air through the spout onto the carpet, allowing the dust to fully reach the bag
 pareekshanon se pataa chalaa he ki vacum pump kii safai se chote pissuon kaa 100% or vayask pissuon kaa 96% safaya ho saktaa he
 a British inventor has developed a new cleaning technique known as the air recycling technique, which uses air flow instead of vacuum to collect the solution from the carpet
 is takanic kii jaanch market trensdermeshan program ) dwaara kii gayi or dikhaaya gaya ki yah vacum paddati kii tulana main kahin adhik urja kushal he
 However, the use of air recycling technology is not currently used in the manufacture of any cleaner that works as a prototype
 vacum clinar main is tarah kaa vinyas hota hai: Most vacuum cleaners are supplied with a variety of special attachments, tools, brushes, and additional rungs for expansion, so that they can reach inaccessible locations or be used for cleaning a variety of surfaces
 aise sabase adhik aam upkarnon nimna hai: The vacuum, due to its nature, carries air through the evacuation of air that is not completely sieved
 iske kaaran sehat main samasya pesh aa sakati he, kyonki prachaalak antat: dhul fans hi letaa hai
 Manufacturers use many methods to solve this problem
 ek hi vacum main kai tareeke ek saath sammilit kiye ja sakate hai
 The filter is usually applied in such a way that the air inside it passes through it before reaching the motor
 Ordinary vacuum cleaners should not be used to clean asbestos fibers, even if a 'hepa' filter is installed
 ek vacum clinar kaa pradarshan kai maapdandon se mapa ja saktaa he: Other details of a vacuum cleaner are as follows: sacshan adhiktam dabaav kaa antar he ki jisaki rachana ek pump kar saktaa he
 For example, in a typical household model the suction is about 20 kpa negative
 iskaa arth yah hua ki 20 kilo pascal dwaara yah saamaanya vayumandaleey dabaav se nalee ke andar ke dabaav ko kam kar saktaa he
 The higher rate of pull makes the cleaner more robust
 pani kaa ek inj 249 pascal ke baraabar hota he; isliye, yah pani kaa ek aam sacshan 80 inch hota he
 Power consumption in cleaners, in watts, is often the only fixed figure
 kai uttar america ke vacum clinar nirmaataa vidyut keval vartmaan ampear main dete hai or upabhokta ko wat main bijli kii dar praapt karne liye line ke 120 volt ke voltage se guna karne ke liye chhod dete hai
 It does not indicate the effectiveness of the power cleaner to the consumer, only the amount of electricity consumed
 bijli ko hawa kii dhar main parivartit kiye maane kii maatra kabhi-kabhi safai karanevaali nalee ke antim chor par dikhaaya jaataa he or ise airwat se mapa jaataa he: isaki ikai mahaj wat hoti he; "hawa" iske kaam karne kii kshamta ke bare main bataata he, na ki bijli kii khapat ke bare main
 The airwatt is derived from the English unit
 eestm international airwat ko 0
117354 *epa* es ke rup main paribhaashit karata he, jahaan epa ft3 / m main hawa ke pravaah kii dar he or pani ke inj main es dabaav he
 This makes one airwatt equal to 0
9983 watts
 kuch chote vacum clinar asi bijli kaa upyog karne ke bajaae kam-vajani, portable or richarge yogya hote hai
 Some vacuum cleaners also have an electric wipe for dry cleaning and later wet cleaning in the same machine
