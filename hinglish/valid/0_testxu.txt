 Behula moved the boat towards the shore

 On seeing his harsh tenacity, Mansa Devi sent him there
 usne behula se kaha, "tum mere saath devloak main chal kar apane nrity se mahadev ko rijhaa do to tumhaare pati pun: jinda ho jaaenge
 "behula accepted his advice
 vah uske saath chal padi pati kii asthiyaan uske vakshasthal se chipki thim
 She started dancing frantically from the memory of her husband

 Its history is several thousand years old
 bhartiya evam chini darshanon ke madhya anek samantaayein hai
 Just as Indian philosophy begins with the four Vedas, especially the Rigveda, Chinese philosophy begins with six "ching" or parts, especially "yi Ching" or 'book of Changes'
 is pustak ke rachanaakaar phu-ji hai
 "yi Ching" begins with 64 symbols known as "kua" or lined images
 in rekhit chitron main se prayek main chah sidhi rekhaayen hoti hai jo tuuti hui yaa bina tuuti hui yaa donon prakaar kii hoti hai
 Foreign scholars have also termed them as conspirators
 ye shadrekhakritiyaan aath moulik evam adhik saadharanpratikon dwaara bani hai
 Each consists of three straight lines that are either segmented or un-segmented
 inhen "paa kuan" yaa aath "trigram" kehete hai
 Multiplying each of these eight trigrams with each other eight times multiplies 64 productions such as: parampara ke anusaar aatho trigraamon kii rachana pratham pracheen samrat phu-si dwaara maani jaati he
 In 64 scribes of the eight trigrams, the product of the product of the product was performed by Fusi himself or by his successor, named as the Second Ancient Emperor
 64 shadrekhakritiyon kii rekhaayen, jinaki sankhya 384 he, "yaa o" ke naam sa prachlit hai
 Along with the conspiracies, they are symbolically called the first "t ai chi" which means Adya Mahan, Ek and Parmasatya
 doosraa li ang-yi yaa do sinddhant, yatha, "yang", jiskaa arth vidhayak evam purushochit shakti he or "yin", kaa arth nishedhak evam striyochit shakti he, teesna "ju-sian" jiskaa arth chaar pratik, yatha pracheen yang, yuva yang, pracheen yin, yuva yin ; or antim, sampurna vishwa ke prakritik drishyon evam sabhi maanviya upkarnon ke vikaas kii abhivyakti
 In other words, Adya Mahan created two principles: two principles, four symbols, four symbols, the whole world
 yah "tao" kii gati yaa sristi ke vikaas kaa dhang yaa maarg prakat karata he
 Immediately after the sixty-four platitudes comes the order of composition of literary books, called "ku-jai" or signs of conscripts, and "yao-ju" or lines
 pehla, sabhi shadrekhakritiyan ke naamon or paribhaashaon kaa varnan karata he
 Second, it gives the details of the names and signs of the meanings of each individual line of all the conspiracies according to their locations and circumstances
 ye donon mulpath vedon kii samhitaon or brahmanon ke samaan he
 Just as six traditional branches of Indian philosophy are popularly known as conspiracies: nyaay vaisheshik, sankhya, yoga, mimasaa or vedant
 Similarly, the same number of branches of China philosophy are popularly known as "liu Chia": "ju-chia" yaa canaphyusius shakha, "tao-chia" yaa tao shakha, "mo-chia" yaa mohist shakha, "fa-chia" or jurist branch, "yin-ya chia" or cosmology branch and "mi-chia" or logical branch
 jis prakaar bhartiya darshan kii chah shakhaayen teen samoohon main milaai ja sakati hai : Nyaya Vaisesika Samkhya Yoga and Mimamsa Vedanta; usee prakaar unheen sankhyaon main chini darshan kii bhi chha: shakhaayen samoohon main sanmilit kii ja sakati hai : The legalist branch of Confucius, the cosmological branch of Tao and the Mohist logical branch
 canaphyusius shakha kaa naam canaphyusius ke naam ke pashchaat padaa jo vidya evam gun donon main purnataprapt pratham evam sabase mahaan guru mana jaataa tha or jisane sabase pehle saadhaaran janata ko vidya or sadgun sikhalaayaa, jiskaa ekadhikaar pehle abhijatya shaasha varg ke haath main tha
 Therefore, the followers of Confucius respected knowledge and virtue more than other things
 "lun-yu" yaa canaphyusius kii saahitiyik jhaankiyon ke sangrah naamak pustak main canaphyusius ne sabase pratham shabd "hsuyeh" kaa ullekh kiya he jiskaa arth siikhnaa he
 The Guru had said: "continually learning from industry and experiment, is it not a delightful thing?" 
 tatpashchaat anek avasaron par, canaphyusius ne apane anuyaayiyon ke saath gyaan kii charchaa kii yaa uske sambadh main vivaad kiya
 "guru said, at the age of 15 i resolved to attain enlightenment
 30 varsh kii avasthaa main main drudh tha
 At 40, i had no doubt
 50 kii avasthaa main mujhe ishwar ke adeshon kaa bhaan hua
 At 60, my ear became obedient to satyagraha
 70 varsh kii avasthaa main use samajhane laga jisaki ichha meraa hriday karata tha or aisa karne main sat kaa atikaraman nahin kiya, 
 Again the Guru said, "in a small village of ten families, i could find such a distinguished and true person like me but could not find such a lover of knowledge
 
 According to Confucius, both knowledge and contemplation must coexist
 guru ne kaha, "gyaan bina chintan ke parishram nasht karnaa he; bina gyaan ke chintan bhayaavah he
 "
 chintan evam gyaan milakar bhi paryaapt nahin hai
 Work should also be done with them
 duusare shabdon main, gyaan or vichaar donon nishchay hi prayog main laana chahie
 Confucius' feelings and thoughts are privately moral, ethical, social and human
 canaphyusius ne jaanboojhkar kuch durgam samasyaon kii upeksha kii he
 Confucius's literary tableaux suggests that the subjects on which the Guru spoke were: strange objects, supernatural powers, things which are not in proper order, and phantoms and gods
 ek baar uske anuyaayi chi-lu ne prenton or devataaon kii seva karne ke sambandh main poocha
 The Guru said: "when you are not fit to serve human beings, then how can you serve gods and deities?" Chi-lu said: "I dare to ask about death
 " use pun: uttar diya gaya, "jab tum jivan ke vishay main nahin jaanate, to kis prakaar tum mrityu ke sabandh main jaan sakate ho?" 
 Confucius himself once said to his follower Ju-kus: "I would prefer not to speak more
 " ju-kung ne poocha : "agar tum guru nahin bolte ho, tumhaare anuyaayi, ham logon ko kya likhata he?" guru ne kaha : "kya ishwar bolta he? chaaron rituen apane apane maarg kaa anusaran karti hai or vastuen lagaataar utpann kii jaati hai, kintu kya ishwar kuch kahata he?" 
 After Confucius, two other great men of this branch were Men-ju or Mencius and sun-ju
 donon ne canaphyusius kaa sabase mahaan guru ke rup main aadar kiya or prakat rup se usee shikshaaon kaa anusaran kiya : kintu unhone canaphyusius kii vyakhya bhinn bhinn dhangon se kii or unke drushtikon bhi bhinn bhinn rahe
 The main difference between them was related to the principles of human nature
 mensius ne maanav swabhaav ko moulik rup se acha mana
 Menङu: Book 2A, Chapter 6
 kintu sun ju ne kaha : "maanav swabhaav bura he; shikshan dwaara isaki achchhai praapt hoti he
 "
 kintu canaphyusius ne swayan ek hi baar kaha tha : "swabhaav se manushya lagbhag ek samaan hote hai; abhyaas se ve ek duusare se bahut alag ho jate hai
 "
 yah chini darshan main ek atyant vivaadaaspad samasyaon main se he
 The juridical branch of philosophy is, in true sense, a system of political principles that merges the ideas and ideals of the Confucian, Tao and Mohist followers independently
 kintu iskaa adhik sambandh baad ke donon kii apeksha pehle se adhik he
 Hence, it is more attached to the Confucian branch
 china bhashaa or sahitya main "tao" atyadhik mahatvapurn, vyapak evam rahasyamay he
 Sometimes it means absolute reality or continuous truth
 kabhi kabhi iskaa arth moulik lakshya yaa prakruti kii sarvocch shakti se liya jaataa he
 Sometimes it means the process or path of the manifestation of the universe or the development of the universe
 kabhi kabhi iskaa arth siddhant or sadgun bhi hota he
 It is synonymous with three Sanskrit words, Brahma, Dharma and Marg
 iskaa vivaran lagbhag samast chini dharmik, sahitya visheshkar dharmagrihit evam darshanik kritiyon main miltaa he or samast bhinn bhinn pakshon main prayukt kiya gaya he jo bhinn bhinn dhango se bhinn bhinn vastuon ke liye vyavahrut hua he
 The Tao branch is particularly possessive of the name of the Tao as it makes Mao more characteristic, more appropriately and more profoundly apparent than other branches
 tao shakha kaa mahanatam evam bahut hi prasiddh guru vastav main lao-tju tha jo vaastavik rup se tao darshan kaa janmdata mana jaataa fiai
 After Lao-tzu, the second great Guru is Chua-ju
 lao-tju "tao" ko sristi kaa ucchtam aatma, swayambhu, nirpeksh or shaashvat maanata he jisus sabhi vastuen utpann hoti hai or pun: usee main villin ho jaati hai
 In a book called "tao-tzu" that bears his name or "tao Ti Ching" - the religious system of Tao and Ti, he said: "tao produces one, one produces two, two produces three, Produces all three things
 " 
 In the second passage of the same book, Tao-tzu said: All things in the world are born of "u" or money; And "yu" or wealth is derived from "woo" or poverty
 
 Here "U" or money means Tao
 tao ko kyon "vu" yaa nirdhantaa kehete hai? kyonki tao kuch he jise naam yaa shabd dwaara agochar evam akathaneey samajha jaataa he
 That is why lao-tzu said at the very beginning of the book: "that Tao" that is expressed is not really an eternal name
 akthy swarg evam prithvi kaa prarambh he kathy sabhi vastuon kii janani he
 According to lao-tzu, "tao" is also the creator of each object for each object
 phir bhi aisa jaan padataa he ki yah kisi bhi vastu kaa nirmaan nahin karata he
 For each object is the subject of each object
 phir bhi aisa prathit hota he ki yah kuch bhi nahin karata
 Thus he said: "tao" never does anything, yet by this all things happen
 pun: "aisa hi sarvyaapee shakti kaa kshetra he ki yah akele "tao" dwaara kaary kar saktaa he
 Because "tao" is an experiential and irrational object
 aparimey, anubhavathit; phir bhi isamen aakaar antarhit he
 Experiential and irrational; Even then it has a built in shape
 anubhavathit evam aparimey; phir bhi inke antargat sattayen hai
 It is shadowy and dim, yet has an absolute power inside it
 yah nirpeksh satta atyant vishuddh he kintu phir bhi prabhavotpadak he
 "
 isaliye purushon ko "tao" ke path kaa anusaran karnaa chahie or kisi bhi mulya par iske viruddh kaary nahin karnaa chahie
 The second greatest follower of Tao is Guru Chua Chow or Chua Ju
 isane tao ju kii apeksha bhi adhik gahan rup se evam vyapak drushtikon se "tao" ke siddhaton kaa pratipaadan kiya
 He is also considered to be China's greatest mystic
 uskaa moulik vichaar nirpeksh samanta evam prayek jeev se mukti praapt karnaa he
 At the same time it is to establish complete unity and integrality with all beings
 kisi prakaar kaa koi bhed vibhed nahin hona chahie jaise "acha yaa bura", "sat yaa asat", "bada yaa chota", "lanbaa yaa nata", "oonch yaa neech", "dhani yaa daridr", "kuleen yaa saamaanya", "buddha yaa noujvaan", "prarambh yaa ant", jivan yaa mrityu ityadi
 Because these are all humanized relative terms
 vastav main ya sabhi ek or abhinn hai kyonki sabhi jeev usee "tao" se utpann hue hai or usee "tao" main villin ho jaayenge
 The difficulty is that when all these things were created at once, humans not only saw separation and distinction but did not take care of fundamental unity and integrality
 yahi samast pakshapaaton evam agyanta kaa kaaran rahaa
 At the same time, for the same reason, conflict and discord, hatred and enmity, violence and cruelty, imprisonment and slavery and many other bad things have been causing all kinds of suffering and sorrow from time to time
 jab tak ham log in samast vastuon ko samaapt nahin kar lenge vishwa main vaastavik swatantraaa evam sukh nahin dikhalaai degaa
 Only those people will get absolute freedom and complete happiness, who will keep themselves free from all kinds of distinctions and distinctions
 aise vyaktiyon ko chuang-ju ne "chen jan" arthath sachche purush kii sangya di he
 He is also referred to as "chih-jen" meaning perfect man, or "shen-jin" spiritual man, or "sheङ-jen" meaning sage or saint
 ise sachche vyakti, puurnavyakti, aadhyatmik vyakti, rishi yaa sant vishay main chuang-ju ne kaha tha, "purna vyakti ke antargat aapa nahin he, aadhyamki vyakti main siddhi nahin he; rishi yaa sant kaa koi naam nahin he
 "and" the ancient true man neither saw life in terms of love nor had any feeling of hatred towards Bhrita
 jivit rahete hue use atyant anand kaa anubhav bhi nahin hota tha or marate hue vah koi pratirodh nahin karata tha
 Deliberately, he did not try to forget what his beginning was and did not even try to find out what his end would be
 jo kuch uske paas aayaa use usne prasantaapurvak swikar kiya or jo bhujaa diya gaya tha use usne bina chetana ke chhod diya
 This is called not giving preference to the conscious mind more than "tao", or nature is said to be complementary to the individual
 aise ko hi ham laag sachcha vyakti kehete hai
 
 pun: "purna vyakti pret kii bhanti he
 If large lakes are burnt, it will not feel hot
 yadi badi badi nadiyaan jamkar sakht ho jaayan, vah thandhak nahin prathit karegaa
 If the mountains are broken by the thunderbolt or the storm produces waves in the oceans, then that fear will not be there
 aisa hote hue, vah badalon par chadh jayega, surya or chandramaa par chadh jayega or samudron ke baahar saraltapurvak bhraman karegaa
 Neither death nor life will have any effect on him
 kya iskaa dhyaan bahut hi kam rahegaa ki kya upyogi he or kya haniprad he?" 
 The philosophy of the cosmological branch is based on two cosmological principles, namely "yin" and "ya"
 isaliye inkaa naam "yin-yang chia" yaa vishwavigyaan sambandhi shakha he
 As already described, the words "yin" and "ya" first appeared in the "yi-chi" or Book of Changes, and that "ya" means a lawful and malevolent principle or power, and "yin" means prohibitive and Female is the principle or power
 in donon ke sameekaran se samast vishwa kii utpatti hui
 They have been interpreted seriously and widely by followers of both Confucius and Tao
 kintu vishwavigyaan sambandhi darshanikon ne in donon siddhanton kaa prayog "yin" evam "yang" kaa maanav jivan ke sookshmatam pakshon ke prayek kshetra kaa lekar kiya
 This branch is actually a mixture of more or less Confucian and Tao ideologies
 kintu canaphyusious kii vichaardhaaraon kii apeksha inkaa adhik sambandh tao kii vichaardhaara se he
 Therefore it is related to the Tao School
 mohist shakha kaa naam mo-ti yaa moju ke naam par padaa jo is shakha kaa saadhaarant: janmdata mana jaataa he
 Mo-ju is considered an important figure in ancient Chinese history
 anek drushtikonon se mo-ju kii tulana pracheen bhartiya mahavir jain or aadhunik bhartiya mahatma gandhi se kii jaati he
 Their life and principles are very similar
 mo-ju ke atyant mahatvapurn siddhant vishvaprem evam ahimsa nirpeksh pararthwaad or yatitvvaad hai
 Mencius, a follower of the great Confucius, once said - "mo-ju" sees all human beings with a view of love without distinction
 yadi apane sampurna sharir ko sir se endi tak paseene se vishwa ko laabh pahunchaa saken, to va aisa karne ko taiyaar the
 Prior to Mo-ju, the ideas of world-wide love and non-violence, altruism and romanticism were found in Chinese ideologies
 kintu mo-ju kaa mahaan kaary chini darshan ke kshetra main yah tha usne in siddhanton kaa sway na keval abhyaas kiya balki usne tarknayukta neenv par sthir kiya or unako ek darshanik paddati kii ikai main dhaala
 Mo-ju not only opposed the doctrines of Confucius and his branch, but also opposed the traditional rituals and institutions of ancient China
 canaphyusius ke anuyaayiyon ne atyant praytn kiya, "ki ve bina laabh ke parinaam ko soche hi nitiparayanata main sahin rahen; apane siddhanton main nirmal rahen bina yah soche ki iskaa parinaam prashansaneey evam laabhprad hoga
 "
 kintu mo-ju or mohist shakha ke anuyaayiyon ne yogyata evam laabh par atyadhik bal diya
 Mo-ju said: "the objective of those who are virtuous is to get benefits for the world and to resolve their objections
 " or "parspirik prem se parsparik laabh hota he
 "again" will benefit from fair love
 " or dusron ke saath prem karne tathaa unhen laabh pahunchaane se sarvashrey paidaa hota he
 Re: "he who loves others also loves others
 " Mo-ju's second important principle is to preach against his war
 mo-ju ke anusaar sabase mahaan aparaadh kisi desh par akraman karnaa he
 There should be no excuse for such work
 mo-ju kaa yah upadesh us samay ke rajyon ke parsparik sambadhon main prachlit drushtikonon kii aushadhi tha
 Even today, according to the situation, this medicine can be given to the world
 chini bhashaa main taarkik shakha ko "min chia" kehete hai jiskaa shabdic arth "naamon kii shakha" he; yaa "pa" ian-che, jiskaa arth vadavivaad karanevaale se he athwa jinka arth pracheen greek vitandavadiyon yaa tark karanevaalon se bhi liya jaataa he
 We use the term "logicians" here because they behave like the logics of western philosophy
 is shakha ke moulik siddhanton kaa pratipaadan pehle hi se canaphyusius, lao-tju, mo-ju or visheshkar mohiston dwaara kiya gaya he
 The logicians only developed them in sure Chinese philosophy so they belong to the Mohist branch
 is shakha ke sabase mahatvapurn pratinidhi nimnlikhit hai : Hie-shih and ku-sun kun hiy shih kii pustak "van-vu-shuo" yaa das sahastra upaadaanon par niabandh jo bahut pehle kho gaya tha
 The authenticity of Kun Sun Lun's work "lun-sun-kun-ju" is suspicious
 ham log jo unke siddhantan ke sambadh main jaanate hai ve "shih shih" yaa hiy shih kii das samasyaayen, ore arha-shih-yi-shih yaa ku-sun-lu
 or anya tarkikon kii 21 samasyaayen hai
 These problems are mostly understood as contradictions
 vastav main ye virodhabhas nahin hai balki darshanik or vaigyanik prashn, tathvik or pratyaksh, sattashastreey or vishwavigyaan sambandhi, gyaanavaad sambandhi or taarkik samasyaayen hai : ve sabhi vishwa main vastuon kii saapekshata ke udhaaharan hai
 The main topics are: atev hiy shih kaa nishkarsh he : "samast vastuon ko maan rup se prem kii drushti se dekhnaa chahie, akaash evam prithvi ek hai
 " yadhyapi anek bhinn bhinn vichaar evam siddhant chini darshan kii bhinn bhinn shakhaon main prachlit rahen hai; phir bhi unki anek baton main samanta rahi he
 Thus there is a contrast between monotony and monotony
 jis prakaar bhartiya darshan kii sabhi bhinn bhinn paddatiyon kaa antim lakshya mukti yaa moksh rahaa he, yaa maanavtaa kii swatantraaa rahaa he, usee prakaar chini darshan kii anek shakhaon kaa charam dhyey "shi-shih" or "shi-jine" yaa sansar or maanav jati se muktipaana rahaa he
 Both freedom and liberation are a state of perfection
 purnataa kaa arth vaastavik anand he
 Genuine bliss is true peace, love, harmony, freedom, equality and unity
 ye sabhi vastuen kisi duusare lok kii siddhi nahin hoti balki inaki siddhi isi lok main yahi or abhi manani chahie
 That is why all the different branches of Chinese philosophy place more emphasis on human life and ethics
 chini bhashaa main nitishastra kaa bahut hi vyapak arth he
 It not only explains the relationship between Maavan, but also describes the relationship between man and nature and also sheds light on the relation of man and all other creatures and things
 chini darshan ke anusaar maanavtaa saamanjasypurna samashtiwad kaa jivan he na ki prabal udyog karte hue vyashti ore nishedhak kaa jivan
 The ultimate goal and intention of humanity should be to achieve mankind for all mankind, neither individual nor caste nor state should be the ultimate goal

 Rajyavardhan was the eldest son of Prabhakarvardhan, the ruler of Thaneswar
 vah apane bhai harshavardhan or bahan rajyashri se bada tha
 Rajyavardhan was four years older than Harshvardhan

 a fierce war resulted in the killing of Rajyavardhana by King Shashank of Bengal
 rajyavardhan kii bahan rajyashri kaa vivaah kannauj ke maukhari vansh ke shaasha grihavarman se hua tha
 Soon after Prabhakarvardhan's death, Devagupta attacked Kannauj and a fierce battle ensued
 yuddh main grihavarman malwa ke raja devgupt ke haathon maaraa gaya or uski patni rajyashri ko bandi banaakar kannauj ke kaaragaar main daal diya gaya
 As soon as the information was received, Rajyashree's elder Agraj Rajyavardhan left for Kannauj to free his sister from prison
 rajyavardhan ne malwa ke shaasha devgupt ko parajeet karke maar daalaa, kintu vah swayan devgupt ke sahaayak or bengal ke shaasha shashaank dwaara maaraa gaya
 At this time Rajyashree escaped from prison due to the heavy upheaval prevailing in the state and took refuge in the forests of Vindhyanchal
 baad main rajyavardhan ke uttaradhikari samraat harshavardhan ne rajyashri ko vindhyanchal ke jangalon main us samay dhund nikaala, jab vah niraash hokar chita main pravesh karne hi vaali thi
 Harshvardhan brought him back to Kannauj and respected him for his lifetime

 The military government formed a Constitutional Commission in February 1960 which constituted the 1962 Constitution

 On 25 March 1969, this Constitution was also suspended during the Constitutional disaster of 1970 and declared an emergency

 And, a constitution was first established by the 1973 constitution, with the Senate presided over by retired Niyamurthi Habibullah Khan, who remained in 1977, so that all the smaller states get representation like the larger states

 Independents islamic jamhuri ittehad / pakistan muslim lig Republican Party / Pakistan Muslim League pakistan piples party Military samayrekha a firewall is a part of a computer system or network that is built to prevent unauthorized access and to allow authorized communication
 It is a device or set of devices that is configured in a way that permits, denies, encrypts, decrypts or proxies computer traffic between other security domains based on many rules and other standards

 In the former case, it acts to prevent intrusion into private networks
 In the latter case, structural fires prevent and delay the spread of nearby structures

 Before networked firewalls for network security, routers were used in the late 1980s to separate the networks from each other
 The idea of a relatively small community of Internet users, who were open to sharing and cooperation, was brought to an end by the considerable breach of Internet security that occurred in the late 1980s

 Many firewalls provide such features by tying user identities to IP and MAC addresses which are very predictable and can be easily changed around
 The nufw firewall provides a genuine identity based firewall by requesting the user's signature for each connection

 Packets are not allowed to pass through the firewall until they match the rules of the establishment of the government
 Firewall administrators can define rules or apply default rules
 The term "packet filter" originated in the context of the BSD operating system

 It may also be necessary to filter in case-free network protocols that do not have a session concept

 Conversely, intruders hijack a public-facing system and use it as a proxy for their own purposes, and the proxy then looks to other internal machines disguised as that system
 While the use of internal address spaces increases security, crackers can still serve as an IP spoofing method and attempt to pass packets to the target network

 trivikram bhatta dwaara rachit 'nalchampu', jo dasvin sadi ke prarambh kii rachana he, champoo kaa prasiddh udhaaharan he
 Apart from this, the Yashashtilak composed by Somdev Suri, Bhojraj's Champu Ramayana, the poet Karnapuri's Anandavrindavan, Gopal Champu, Neelkanth Champu and Champu are examples of India from tenth to seventeenth century
 yah kavy rup adhik lokapriy na ho sakaa or na hi kavyashastra main uski vishesh manyata hui
 Yashodhara in Hindi is called champu-kavya, because both prose-verse has been used in it
 gadhy or padya ke is mishran kaa uchit vibhaajan yah prathit hota he ki bhavatmak vishyon kaa varnan padya ke dwaara tathaa varnanaatmak vishyon kaa vivaran gadhy ke dwaara prastut kiya jaay
 But Champurichayas have given importance to their free will and personal interest in the combination of both, by not paying special attention to this psychological feature
 gadhy-padya kaa sanmishran sanskrit sahitya main pracheen he, parantu kavyastylee main nibaddh, "champu" kii sangya kaa adhikari gadhy-padya kaa samanjas mishran utana pracheen nahin mana ja saktaa
 The compositions of prose-verse are available in Krishna Yajurvedic codes
 pali jaatakon main bhi gadhy main kathanak tathaa padya main mul sutratmak sanketon kii uplabdhi avashya hoti he
 But being devoid of poetry, we cannot consider them as "champu" in any way
 harishen rachit samudragupta kii prayagprashasti tathaa buddha kavi yanshur pranit jatakamala champu ke aadim rup maane ja sakate hai, kyonki pehle main samudragupta kii digvijay tathaa duusare main 34 jataka vishuddh kavyastylee kaa aashray lekar alankrita gadhy padya main varnit hai
 Champu seems to have been an enlarged form of prose poetry and that is why this poetic form emerged around the eternal ninth century of the golden age of prose poetry
 champu kavy kaa pratham nidarshan trivikram bhatta kaa nalchampu he jisamen champu kaa vaishishty sphutatya udbhasith hota he
 The trivikram composed this dainty champu while staying in the shelter of Indraj, the son of King Jagatuga and Lakshmi, the grandson of King Krishna of the south
 indraraj kaa rajbhishek visan 972 main hua tha or unke ashrith hone se kavi kaa bhi vahi samay he dasham shatee kaa purvardh
 The famous pranayakha of Nal and Damayanti is described in a very miraculous manner in the seven sorrows of this champu
 kavy main sarvatra shubhaga sanbhag shlesh kaa prasad lakshith hota he
 The "yashastilak Champu" of the Jain poet Somprabhasuri is a medieval work of the tenth century
 granthkaar rashtrakutanaresh krishna ke samant chalukya arikeshri ke putr kaa sabhakavi tha
 The character of King Yashodhar, eminent in Jain Puranas is described in detail in this Champu
 champu ke antim teen uchhravaason main jaindharm ke siddhaton kaa vistrut vivaran prastut kar kavi ne in siddhanton kaa paryaapt prachaar prastaar kiya he
 The description of the various religious, economic and social subjects of that era in the book is indicative of the comprehensive and multi-faceted worship of Somprabhasuri
 ram tathaa krishna ke charit kaa avlamban kar anek pratibhashali kaviyon ne apni pratibha kaa ruchir pradarshan kiya he
 Among such champu poems, Bhojraj's Ramayana Champu, Anantabhatta's "bharat Champu", Shesh Krishna's "parijataharan Champu" are quite famous
 bhojraj ne ramayana champu kii rachana kiskindha cond tak hi kii thi, jisaki purti lakshmana bhatta ne "yukand" kii tathaa venkatraj ne "uttar cond" kii rachana kar kii thi
 Like Jain poets, Chaitanya Mataavalambi Vaishnava poets adopted this fine poetry medium with great success to spread their principles
 bhagwaan shrikrishna kii lalaam lilaon kaa prasang aisa hi sundar avasar he jab in kaviyon ne apni aloksaamanya pratibha kaa prasad apane champu kaavyon ke dwaara bhakt pathakon ke saamne prastut kiya
 Anandavrindavan Champu of Poet Karnapur, and Gopalchampu of Jeeva Goswami are extremely successful poets in terms of Saras poetry
 inamen se pratham kavy krishna kii balalilaon kaa vistrut tathaa vishad varnan karata he, dwitiya kavy krishna ke samgr charit kaa maarmik vivaran he
 Eminent author Mitra Mishra of "veeramitrodaya", "anandakand Champu" adds an interesting series to Krishnaprakum champs
 dakshin bharat main bhi champukavyon kii lokapriyata kam na thi
 Neelkanth Dixit's "neelkanthvijay Champu" is about Samudramanthan
 shri vaishnav venkatadhvari ke "vishvagunadarsh champu" kii rachana anya champuon se is baat main vishisht he ki isamen bharat ke naanaa tirtho, dharmo tathaa shastragyon main dosha tathaa gunon kaa udghaatan badi maarmikata se ek saath kiya gaya he
 This is a particularly popular poem
 vanishwar vidyalankar kaa "chitrachampu" bengal ke ek vishisht pandit kavi kii rachana he jisamen bhakthi dwaara bhagwatprapti kaa sanket rupakastyle main ek saras aakhyaan ke madhya se kiya gaya he 
 Thus, despite being a popular medium for many centuries for the manifestation of sentiments in Sanskrit literature, Champu poetry could not be stagnant in North Indian language literature
 drawidi bhashaa ke sahitya main samanyat:, kerali tathaa andhra sahitya main visheshat:, champu kavy aaj bhi lokapriy he jiske pranyan kii ore kavijanon kaa dhyaan purnat: aakrisht he
 Barbaric languages are the native languages of the barbarians of North Africa
 bhashavaigyanik nazariye se inhen afro-asian yaa sami-hami bhashaa-parivaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 There are six main branches of Berber languages - kisi ek shakha kii barbar upbhasha bolne vaale ko kisi anya shakha kii boli puri tarah samaj nahin aati kyonki in shakhaon main shabdon or lahaze kaa aapasi farq ho gaya he
 Berbery has its own ancient alphabet named "tiffinag", whose oldest writing is found from 200 BCE
 barbar ilaaqon par arabi akraman or qabze ke baad iskaa prayog lagbhag khatm ho gaya haalanki gahare registan main rahane vaale tuarag-bhashiyon main iskaa istemaal jari rahaa
 Many barbarians left Barbary and began to speak Arabic, and those who used to write Berbari also used the Arabic alphabet
 tuarag ilaaqon ke alaava anya barbar kshetron main arabi varnon kaa yah prayog 1000 i se 1500 i tak prachlit rahaa
 In the 19th and 20th centuries, Barbarian began to be written in Roman script along with European communism
 is "barbar latin varnmaala" kaa istemaal morocco or algeria main bahut hone laga, visheshkar kabaili barbar likhane ke liye
 In 2003, Morocco, in keeping with barbaric self-respect, formally gave official recognition to a modern form of the Tifing script, but still the tribal Berber writers use the Berber Latin script more often
 iske vipareet, tuarag aabaadiyon vaale mali or nizer ne barbar latin lipi ko manyata de di he haalanki vahaan tifinag adhik prachlit he
 Nouns in English do not have gender, whereas nouns in Hindi are feminine or masculine
 barbari is maamle main hindi kii tarah he
 Pulling nouns begin with 'A / A', 'U / O' or 'E / E' - kisi sangya ko bahuvachan banane ke liye teen vidhiyaan hai - kis vidhi kaa prayog hota he yah sangya par nirbhar karata he
 For comparison, Hindi also has three ways - the plural of 'shoe' is 'shoes', 'flies' of 'fly' and 'fruit' of 'fruit'
 barbari kii kuch sangyaaon par 'saamaanya vidhi' lagu hoti he jisamen shabd kaa pehla swar badal kar uske ant main 'na' laga diya jaataa he - The broken method is applied to some nouns in which only the vowels of a singular word are altered to make the plural - teesraa tareeqa mishrit vidhi hoti he, jo pehali do vidhiyon kaa mishran he - To make the feminine of a noun, 't' is placed around its masculine form in the singular and in the plural only 'ta' is applied to its beginning - dhyaan den ki "taimazimut", "tifinag" or kai anya barbari shabdon main prayog hone vaale varna 'ga' kaa uccharan "ga" se bhinn he
 It is like the 'gha' of 'ghazal'
 isi tarah 'kh' kaa uccharan bhi 'kha' se bhinn he 
 Pakistan's land is the national anthem of Pakistan
 ise urdu main "qaumi taraana" kaha jaataa he
 It was written by Hafeez Jalandhari and composed by Akbar Muhammad
 yah san 1954 main pakistan kaa raashtragan bana or us se pehle jagannatha azaad dwaara likhit "i sarazamin-e-paak" pakistan kaa raashtragan tha
 There is more emphasis on Persian words than ordinary Urdu in Pak land
 14 agast 1947 ko bharat vibhajit hua or purv or pashchim main ek nae desh pakistan ne janm liya
 The dream of Quaid Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah of Pakistan came true
 nayaa desh banane ke saath hi desh ke liye vibhinn chinh or pratik chunane kaa kaam bhi shuru hua
 The country's flag was already prepared, but the national anthem was not made
 azaadi ke samay pakistan ke paas koi raashtra-geet nahi tha
 Therefore whenever the flag was chanted, "pakistan Zindabad, Azadi Pindabad" slogans were raised
 jinnah ko yah manzur nahi tha
 He wanted that the work of creating the national song of Pakistan should be completed soon
 unke salaah kaaron ne unako anekon janemaane urdu shaayaron ke naam sujhaaye jo geet rach sakate the
 But Jinnah's thinking was different
 unhen laga ki duniya ke samaksh pakistan kii dharmanirpeksh chhavi sthapit karne kaa yah acha mauka he
 So he told the great Urdu poet and native Hindu Jagannath Azad of Lahore that "I can give you only five days, you can write a national song for Pakistan"
 jagannatha azaad achambhit bhi the or khush bhi the
 But the radical leaders of Pakistan were very angry that a Hindu would write the national anthem of Pakistan
 lekin jinnah kii marzi ke aage ve bebas the
 Finally, within five days Jagannath Azad composed the national song which Jinnah liked very much
 gane ke bol the - Oh my heart, your love is better than mine, today your happiness is nowhere jinnah ne ise raashtra-geet ke rup me manyata di or unki mrityu tak yahi geet raashtra-geet bana rahaa
 But just 18 months after the acceptance of this song, Jinnah died and with him the recognition of the national song was ended
 jagannatha azaad baad main bharat chale aae
 After Jinnah's death, the Government of Pakistan formed a rashtra-geet Committee
 or jane maane shairo ke paas se geet ke namoonay mangavaaye
 But no song was able to become a national song
 aakhirkaar pakistan sarkaar ne 1950 me ahamed chagala dwaara rachit dhun ko rashtriya dhun ke rup me manyata di
 At the same time, Shah of Iran visited Pakistan and liked the tune
 yah dhun paashchaatya adhik lagati thi, lekin raashtra-geet cameti kaa maananaa tha ki iskaa yah swaroop paashchaatya samaaj me adhik sweekrut hoga
 In 1954, Urdu poet Hafiz Jalandhari composed a song based on this tune
 yah geet raashtra-geet cameti ke sadasyon ko pasand bhi aayaa
 And finally the song written by Hafiz Jalandhari became the national song of Pakistan

 Also known as in-ear monitors or canalphones) is an earphone that is inserted directly into the ear canal
 canalphone also offers the same portability as earbuds and acts like earplugs to prevent noise from the external environment
 There are two main types of iems: universal and custom
 Universal canalphones provide additional cover in two or more sizes that fit different ear canals
 These are usually made from silicone rubber, elastomer or foam to allow noise isolation

 The static electrical conductor is composed of a thin, electrically charged diaphragm, usually with a PET film coating over it, hung between two metal plates with holes
 Electrical sound is indicated on the electrode to create an electric field; Depending on the opposing habits of this region, it depends on which plate the diaphragm is attracted to
 The electrical signal continuously changing with the force of air through the orifice produces a strong sound wave
 Static power headphones are generally far more expensive than rotating coils and are relatively uncommon
 Additionally, a special amplifier is required to bend the curtain to amplify the signal, often requiring electrical capacities in the range of 100 to 1000 volts

 a balanced armature is a sound transducer designed primarily to increase the electrical potential of an element by removing pressure from the characteristic diaphragm of many other magnetic transducer systems
 Schematically as shown in the first diaphragm, it consists of a rotating magnetic armature, which is mounted on an axis so that it rotates in a permanent magnetic field
 When properly placed in the magnetic field, there is no total force on the armature, which is why the term 'balanced' came into vogue
 As shown in the second figure, when electricity flows through the coil, it imparts magnetic properties to the armature from one side or the other, allowing it to rotate slightly on one side or axis, Hence the diaphragm rotates to make sound

 inamen se kuch ne sankeern bandwidth swar sanketon ke liye 20% se 40% kii seemaa main vidyut dhwani ke roopantaran kshamta ko ascharyajanak rup se hasil kiya
 Being very small in size and size, today they are generally used only for canalphones and hearing aids
 They are usually limited to the peak of the wave of hearing capacity and require much more persistence than other types of drivers to dedicate their full potential
 High-range models can employ a variety of armature drivers, using passive crossover networks to divide the frequency range between them
 Some combine an armature with a small moving coil to increase bass output

 Magnetostriction headphones are sometimes sold under the label of "bonfons", which work through transmission against vibration to the head, transmission of sound is through bone conduction
 This is particularly useful in situations where the ear is left unobstructed or when used by those who are deaf for reasons that do not affect the system of their auditory nervous system
 However magnetostriction headphones have their own limitations of reliability compared to traditional headphones, which work through the normal ear function
 Additionally, in the 1990s there was an attempt by the French company plasmamonics to market plasma-ionization headphones
 It is believed that no example of methodology has been left out

 Binaural recordings use a different type of microphone technology to convert symbolic instruction using a dummy head from a very small dimensional gap (except for a very small dimensional difference) to a step directly and can create live spatial effects through headphones Huh
 Commercial recording almost always uses stereo recording, because historically listening on loudspeakers has become more popular than listening with headphones
 Between channels on headphones or — and even better — the ballin shuffler that employs the slow frequency of different information content in a stereo signal) using frequency dependent cross feeds for nearly better presentation of speaker reproduction using spatial effects of stereo sound Change is possible
 While cross-feed reduces unpleasantness, which some listeners get to hear very loud hoarse stereo in headphones, The use of a dummy head prosthetic head during recording allows playback through the headphones, to gain the experience of listening to a performance through the top of the dummy head
 Since the shape and size of the artificial head are very large, the best sound is achieved when the dummy head matches the head of the listener

 Over time, the headphone cable failed
 a common scenario was this, where the copper wire at the connecting point of the purchased device (on the electric wire jack, or on the connecting point of the headphones) may need to be replaced
 Wire spans are the largest and most stressful condition and are therefore usually fitted to some extent as stress relievers

 Less awareness of external sound then exacerbates other risks - in some places the use of headphones while driving is banned, usually limiting the use of earphones in one ear
 Complete isolation from external noise can be a danger in itself, as the user is unable to hear the sound of the horn of the vehicle, which can lead to fatal consequences if moving between traffic
 Lack of situational awareness can lead to theft, especially in busy environments such as underground stations, where if a person hits someone, it is ignored

 Listening to music through headphones while exercising can be dangerous
 The blood shifts from the inner ear towards the other organs through the ear, due to which the loud sound can cause damage
 a Finnish study suggested that exercisers keep the intensity of their headphones at half their normal intensity and use it only for half an hour

 in baaqi polinisian jagahon kii tarah, tonga main bhi laharbaazi hone kaa varnan he
 Continuous wind blowing over open water in a large area like the sea produces a great wave of waves, called anion
 anayan kitna adhik hoga, yah hawa kii gati or bahaav ke kaal par nirbhar karata he
 Because of this, the movement of waves is more where there is less air pressure and where a long coastline is located on the open sea
 hawa kaa sthaneey bahaav laharon par kaafii asar rakhata he
 If a slight or medium wind is moving at a short distance from the shore, then it walks in front of the wave and gives it the shape of a round drum or tube, which is more enjoyable for rippling
 agar hawa zyaada tej ho to pani ko uttejit or laharbaazi ke liye karaab kar detii he
 The sea floor behind and below the wave also has a profound effect on the wave
 pani main agar reef ho to vah laharon ke akar ko badal detii he
 With modern techniques, the floor and air can be measured and can be visualized as to how the waves are going to happen next

 Low pressure areas are also sometimes formed on the eastern coasts of subtropical areas because high pressure winds sometimes reach low speeds
 is se yahan purvi taton par unchi mahaatarange dekhi jaati hai
 In summer, cyclones in the hot region produce heavy swells
 yah chakravaat garm samudr main utpann hote he, isiilie el nino or laa nina chakra se prabhavit hote he
 There is no confidence in the direction of such cyclones
 yah kabhi pashchim ko bhi nikal jate hai jaise ki 1979 main kari chakravaat ke saath hua

 Nowadays, a new style of 'air' has also emerged in the wave in which the ripple caught by the wave drops the standing water down on its board and flies in the air for a few moments and then comes down on the wave in a balanced way
 laharbaazi ke is khel main tub kii sawari yukti yaa kaushal kaa pradarshan he
 When a wave begins to break, it often forms a hollow stream as it descends under a rail mound or rock, which enables an experienced waveber to position itself in the hollow part of the wave
 Also called tube
 laharbaaz puri tarah se kai second ke liye pani se ghir saktaa he ; tab tak, jab tak ki lahar tub se baahar nikalne or lahar ke khule munh se waapas peeche jane ke liye baadhya na kare
 tub main sawari karte samay degree kii kathinaayee ke kaaran safai se tub ko paar nahin karke laharbaaz aksar sarfaboard se gir padate hai
 The definitive skill of tube riding can only be gained from years of experience riding hollow waves and it is also necessary to learn to predict how the waves will break, thus you will be able to stay longer inside the tube, or You will be able to get out before the waves break on you
 The world's best known waves for tube riding include the pipeline on the northern coast of Oahu, Tihupu in Tahiti and the g-land waves of Java
