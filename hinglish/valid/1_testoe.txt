 yudhpot ek aisa jalayaan he jiskaa nirmaan yuddh karne ke liye kiya gaya ho
 Warships are usually constructed entirely differently from commercial ships
 sashastr hone ke saath hi saath yudhpot kii rachana usko hone vaali kshati ko sahane ke liye bhi kii jaati he, saath hi ve vyapaarik jalayanon kii tulana main adhik tej tathaa aasaani se mud sakane vaale hote hai
 Unlike a merchant vessel, a warship usually carries arms, ammunition, and supplies for its own crew
 Warships are usually the property of the navy, although they are sometimes kept by some individuals or companies
 yuddh ke samay main, yupoton or vyapaarik jahaazon ke bich kaa antar aksar aspasht ho jaataa he
 Wartime commercial ships are often armed and used as auxiliary warships, for example World War i Q-ships and World War II armed merchant cruisers
 By the 17th century, it was common for commercial ships to be used in naval service, and it was not uncommon to have more than half of the merchant ships in the naval fleet
 In the 19th century it was a common practice to armed large trading vessels, such as galleons, until the threat of piracy had ended
 yupoton kaa prayog sainya tukadiyon ke vaahak athwa rasad saamagree pahunchane vaale jalayaan ke rup main bhi kiya jaataa tha, jaisaa ki francisi nausena 18veen sadi main athwa japani nausena dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay karti thim
 In Mesopotamia, Ancient Persia, Ancient Greece, and the Roman Empire, galleys were the most common type of warship, a long, narrow vessel that was powered by seafaring queues, designed to collide with enemy ships
 Used to drown, or it would run equal to the enemy so that they could be attacked face to face
 chauthi shatabdi isa purv main gulelon ke vikaas tathaa isaki praudyogiki main shodhan ke saath hi helenistic yug se topakhane se las yudhpot ke pehle bedon kaa vikaas hua
 Second and first centuries BC With political integration in the Mediterranean Sea, naval artillery fell out of use
 baad kii anticuity tathaa madhyakaal main 16veen sadi tak nausainik yuddh jalayanon par hi aadhaarit the, inkaa prayog se takkar maar kar, chaalak dal kii talavaaron tathaa vibhinn prakshepastron, jaise dhanush va baan tathaa jalayaan ke parcote par lage baari crossbo se chode gaye tiron kii sahaayta se yuddh lade jate the
 Naval warfare consisted mainly of hitting and boarding actions, so warships did not need to be specially specialized
 14veen sadi main nausainik topakhana punah viksit hua parantu samudr main topein vishesh prachlit nahin ho paayin jab tak ki unhen punah bhar kar usee yuddh main dobaaraa daage jane laayak nahin bana liya gaya
 Boat-based propulsion became impossible due to the size of the large number of artillery ships, and therefore the warships were mainly based on sails
 16veen sadi ke dauraan paal aadhaarit main-of-waar kaa pradurbhaav hua
 By the middle of the 17th century, the number of cannons mounted on the broadside on both sides of warships was increasing, and strategies for the full use of the firepower of each warship in the battlefield were developing
 main-of-waar ab ship of di line ke rup main viksit ho chukaa tha
 In the 18th century the frigate and the sloop-of-war - which were unsuitable for the war zone because of their small size - followed with a convoy of merchant ships, reported enemy ships and blockade the enemy's coastline
 19veen sadi ke dauraan pranodan, aayudh or yupoton ke nirmaan main ek kranti aa gayi
 Steam engines came to light, initially as an auxiliary power source in the second quarter of the 19th century
 kreemian yuddh ne topon ke vikaas ko bahut adhik uddipt kiya
 The introduction of explosive rounds led to the use of iron and then steel for armor on both sides and decks of large warships
 pehle louh aachhadit yupoton, francisi gloer tathaa british warrior ne, lakdi se bane jalayanon ko prachlan se baahar kar diya
 Metal soon replaced wood as the main material for warship construction
 1850 ke dashak se bhaap kii shakti se chalane vaale yupoton ne paal se chalane vaale jalayanon kii jagah le lee, jabaki paal se chalane vaali fregates ke sthaan par bhaap kii shakti se chalane vaale crugers aa gaye
 The invention of the rotating barbets and turrets also changed the armament of the warships, now the cannons could be used to target freely relative to the direction of the ship, and now a smaller number of larger cannons needed to be carried
 19veen sadi ke dauraan aakhri badi naveenta torapeado tathaa torapeado naukaaon kaa vikaas tha
 Small, fast torpedo boats provided the option to build fleets of expensive warships
 yudhpot dizin main ek or kranti sadi ke ant ke sheeghra baad hui, jab britain ne 1906 main sabhi-badi-topon-vaale yudhpot drednot kaa jalavataran kiya
 It was equipped with large, fast and heavy cannons, propelled by steam turbines, from all the warships which it drove out at that very moment
 anya deshon main shighrata se aise hi jalayaan banaaye jane lage
 Britain also developed the first Battlecruiser
 drednot jaisi hi baari topon ke saath or bade hal vaale battlecruzar ko gati paane ke liye armar kii suraksha kaa parityag karnaa padaa
 battlecruzar sabhi tatkaaleen cruzar kii tulana main adhik tej tathaa shaktishaalee the, jinhen usne prachlan se baahar kar diya, parantu battlecruzar tatkaaleen yupoton kii tulana main kahin adhik asurakshit the
 The torpedo boat destroyer was also developed contemporaneously with the dreadnought
 ye vidhvansak torapeado naukaaon se bade, tej tathaa adhik badi topon se las the, inkaa vikaas mukhya jalayanon ko torapeado naukaaon se bachaane ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Before World War II began, Germany and Great Britain once again emerged as the two largest powers of the Atlantic Sea
 Under the Treaty of Versailles, the German Navy was limited to a few small ships
 lekin chaturipurn naamon, jaise "pocket yudhpot" jaise naamon ne british tathaa francisi kamaanon ko dhokhe main daale rakhaa

 World War II drastically changed the design and role of warships
 pehali baar, nausainik kaary dal main vimaanvaahi jahaaj mukhya jalayaan kii bhoomika main pehali pasand ban gayi
 World War II is the only war in history in which numerous battles took place between groups of aircraft carriers
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh main hi radar kaa istemaal pehali baar dekha gaya
 It also saw for the first time such a naval battle in which ships of both sides, never fighting directly, sent planes to attack, as in the Battle of the Coral Sea
 pehali vyaavhaarik pandubbi 19veen shatabdi ke ant main banaayi gayi thi, parantu pandubbiyaan torapeado ke vikaas ke baad vastav main khatarnaak ho gayin
 The submarines had proved their capability by the end of World War I
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan german nausena ke pandubbi bede kii you-boats ne britain ko samarpan kii kagaar tak parajeet kar diya tha saath hi sanyukt raashtra ke tateey jalayanon ko bhi badi kshati pahunchaai thi
 The success of the submarines led to the development of anti-submarine convoy escorts, such as destroyer escorts, during the First and Second World Wars
 Confusingly, the names of these new variants are derived from small warships of the Pal era, such as the Corvette, Sloop and Frigate
 nausainik yuddh main ek pramukh badlaav vimaanvaahi jahaaj ke aane se paidaa hua
 First in Taranto and then in Pearl Harbor, the aircraft showed its ability to carry out a decisive attack on enemy ships, which were out of sight and range of surface moving ships
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke ant tak, vimaanvaahi jahaaj pramukh yudhpot ban gaya tha
 Modern warships can generally be divided into seven main categories: aircraft, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, and amphibious Assault ships
 Battleships may have an eighth class, but are not currently in use in any of the world's navies
 sirf america niskriy lova-shrenee ke byttleship abhi bhi maujuud hai jinhen combatants kaha ja saktaa he, tathaa saamaanya rup se byttleship kaa bina punarparibhaashit hue jalayanon kii ek shrenee ke rup main phir se shaamil karnaa kathin lagata he
 The destroyer can generally be considered the most prominent surface-mounted warship of most modern maritime navies
 haalanki, dhyaan dene kii baat he crugers, vidhvansak, fregates tathaa corwets, jinaki vishisht bhoomikaayen tathaa aakaar hote the, jo ab dhundhlee pad chuki hai
 Most ships are armed with a mix of surface, submarine and anti-aircraft weapons
 ab varg padnaam vishwasaneey rup se visthaapan anukram ko ingit nahin karte hai, tathaa jalayanon kaa aakaar 20veen shatabdi main pratipaadit kii gayi paribhaashaon se kahin adhik bad chukaa he
 Another important difference between older and modern ships is that all modern warships are "soft", lacking the thick armor and protruding torpedo protection found in World War II and older designs
 adhikansh nausenaon main anek prakaar ke sahaayta tathaa sahaayak jalayaan bhi sammilit hote hai, jaise minasvipar, gashti naukaaen tathaa ofshor gashti jalayaan

 All India majlis-e-ittehad-ul Muslimeen or AIMIM is a recognized state political party in the Telangana state of the Indian government, with its head office in the old city of Hyderabad, with its roots in the majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen in 1927
 Was established in Hyderabad State, India
 
 AIMIM has won the Hyderabad constituency Lok Sabha seat since 1984

 These Razakars played an important role in raising MIM
 rajakar or emm ye donon hi sanghathan hyderabad ke deshadrohi or gaddaar nizaam ke kattar samarthak the
 This is the reason that when the country became independent in 1947, the merger of the princely state of Hyderabad with India was fiercely opposed by Kasim Rizvi and his paramilitary organization i
e
 Razakars
 us par 1948 main hyderabad state ke bharat main vilay ke baad bharat sarkaar ne pratibandh laga diya tha
 And the second part which started after the restoration of this party in 1957 when he added "all India" to his name and also changed his constitution
 Qasim Rajvi, who was the president of the Majlis at the time of the Indian government's crackdown against the state of Hyderabad, was arrested and handed over the reins of this party to Abdul Wahd Owaisi, the then famous lawyer, before leaving for Pakistan
 uske baad se yah party isi parivaar ke haath main rahi he
 abdul vahed ke baad salahuddin ovaisi uske adhyaksh bane or ab unke putr asaduddin ovaisi us ke adhyaksh or saansad hai jab unke chote bhai akbaruddin ovaisi vidhaan sabha main party ke netaa hai
 The leaders of this family and Majlis have been alleging that they have been promoting communal tension in Hyderabad with their provocative speeches
 But on the other hand, supporters of the Majlis see it as the answering power of the Bharatiya Janata Party and other Hindu organizations
 rajnatik shakti ke saath saath ovaisi parivaar ke saadhan or sampatti main bhi jabardast vruddhi hui he jisamen ek medical or ejineering college, kai duusare kalege or do aspataal bhi shaamil hai
 AEMEM recorded its first electoral victory in 1960 when Salahuddin Owaisi was elected to the Hyderabad Municipality and then two years later he became a member of the Legislative Assembly
 The power of the Majlis continued to grow
 badhati hui lokapriyata ke saath saath salahuddin ovaisi "salaar-e-millat" ke naam se mashhoor hue

 The interesting thing is that this alliance is still going on in Hyderabad Municipality and Majlis got the post of Mayor with the support of Congress

 The Majlis accused the Congress government of adopting anti-muslim policies and withdrew its support from him
 The uproar over Akbaruddin Owaisi's so-called speech and the way he is arrested and sent to jail is being seen in the context of the confrontation between Congress and Majlis
 adhiktar hyderabad tak simit majalis ab apana prabhaav andhra pradesh ke duusare jilon or padosi rajyon maharashtra or karnataka tak failaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Recently, he created a stir by winning 11 seats in Nanded Municipality of Maharashtra
 The Congress in Andhra Pradesh is troubled by the possibility that AEMEM may join hands with Jaganmohan Reddy's YSR Congress in the 2014 elections
 After the arrest of Akbaruddin Owaisi, there was no possibility of any compromise between the Majlis and the Congress

1 sq

2 sq

 is lihaaj se kshetrafal ke anusaar yah sanyukt rajya america kaa chaudaavaan sabase bada shahar he
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft 
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether causes approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 However, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 °C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ° F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ° F, with overnight lows of 63 ° F
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ° F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ° f and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34 ° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 °F and 73 °F in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 °F in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 °F in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 °F on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 °F on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 is lihaaj se kshetrafal ke anusaar yah sanyukt rajya america kaa chaudaavaan sabase bada shahar he
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft 
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether causes approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 However, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 °C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ° F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ° F, with overnight lows of 63 ° F
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ° F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ° f and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34 ° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 °F and 73 °F in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 °F in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 °F in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 °F on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 °F on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 Out of these 565 princely states, most of which were Princely State, the princely states in India signed the merger letter one by one, or rather one can say that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and VP Menon got it signed

 The entire Bhopal was closed, the state police was trying to control them by throwing water on the agitators
 23 janvari 1949 ko dow shankar dayaal sharma ko aath maah ke liye jail bhej diya gaya
 In the midst of all this, VP Menon once again came to Bhopal, in clear words to the Nawab that Bhopal cannot remain independent, from the geographical, moral and cultural point of view, Bhopal is closer to Malwa, so Bhopal will have to be a part of Madhya Bharat
 
 aakhirkaar 29 janvari 1949 ko nawab ne mantrimandal ko barkhaast karte hue satta ke saare sutara ek baar phir se apane haath main le liye
