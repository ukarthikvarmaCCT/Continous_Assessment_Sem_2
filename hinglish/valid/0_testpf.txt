 An electric generator is a device used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy
 iske liye yah praayah maikel farade ke vidyutchumbakeey preran ke siddhanth kaa prayog karti he
 The electric motor, in contrast, works by converting electrical energy into mechanical energy
 vidyut motor evam vidyut janitr main bout kuch samaan hota he or kai baar ek hi mashin bina kisi parivartan ke dono kii tarah kaary kar sakati he
 The electric generator forces the electric charge to flow through an external circuit
 lekin yah aavesh kaa srijan nahin karata
 It is like a water pump which works only to make water flow, not to produce water
 vidyut janitr dwaara vidyut utpaadan ke liye aavashyak he ki janitr ke roter ko kisi bahari shakti-sreet kii sahaayta se ghumaya jaay
 For this, the use of reciprocating engine, turbine, steam engine, water falling on a turbine or water cycle, an inlay engine, wind turbine or man or animal power can be used
 kisi bhi strot se kii gai yantric urja ko vidyut urja main parivartit karnaa sambhav he
 This energy can be obtained from the falling water of a waterfall or by the heat generated by burning coal, or from a petrol or diesel engine
 urja ke nae nae strot upyog main laae ja rahe hai
 Primarily, nuclear power has also been used extensively in the last few years for electric power and in many countries nuclear power-powered power stations have been built
 jowar bhaaton evam jwalamukhiyon main nihit aseem urja kaa upyog bhi vidyutsakti ke janan ke liye kiya gaya he
 The use of all these power tools to produce electric power is achieved only by giant electric generators, which is basically based on Faraday's' magnetic field on the conductivity principle of conductivity
 farrade kaa yah siddhant nimnlikhit rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : Thus, three main things are required for the generation of electric power: 1
 chumbakeey kshetra, jisamen chaalak ghumaya jaae, 2
 Driver and 3
 chaalak ko chumbakeey kshetra main ghumaanevaali yantric shakti
 It is also clear that to make the production of electric power practical, the driver induced VVB
 The amount should be sufficient
 isaki maatra, chaalak kii lambaai, chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata or chaalak ke veg par nirbhar karti he
 In fact it can be expressed by the following equation: jahaan, E= vidyutvahak bal, B=chumbakeey abhivah kaa ghanatv, l =chaalak kii lambaai tathaa v=chaalak kaa veg This makes it clear that in practice both the length and velocity of the conductor must be very high and the magnetic flux density should also be maximum
 chumbakeey kshetra kii adhiktam ho
 The maximum limit of a magnetic field is determined by its saturation
 chaalak kii lambaai badhanaa bhi vyaavhaarik rup se sambhav nahin, parantu ek se adhik chaalak ko is prakaar samyojit kiya ja saktaa he ki unamem prerit vi
vaa
ba
 judakar vyaavhaarik ban jaae
 In fact, the generator consists of a system of conductors in place of a conductor, which are connected to each other according to a set scheme
 in chaalkon ko dhaaran karanevaala bhaag armechar kehalaata he or inaki sangyojan vidhi ko armechar kundalan kehete hai
 As the velocity is high, the centrifugal force on the rotating conductors becomes very high, which may cause their arrangement on the armature to be disturbed
 at: inhen armechar par bane khaanpon main rakhaa jaataa he
 The armature holds the drivers and rotates them, for which its shaft is coupled to the shaft of the mechanical energy feeder
 yah yantra pani se chaalanevaala tarabine, yaa bhaap se chaalanevaala tarabine yaa ingine, ho saktaa he
 The available mechanical energy in any form can be used to rotate the shaft of the armature
 is prakaar vibhinn prakaar ke yantra janitr ko chalaane ke liye prayukt kiye jate hai
 These are called prime drivers
 vibhinn prakaar ke ingine, jaise vaashp ingine, dijal ingine, petrol ingine, gas tarabine ityadi mashine, pradhan chaalak ke rup main prayukt kii jaati hai or inaki yantric urja ko janitr dwaara vidyut urja main parivartit kiya jaataa he
 The armature is made of magnetic material, allowing it to carry a magnetic field
 saamanyat: yah ek vishesh prakaar ke ispaat kaa bana hota he, jise armechar ispaat hi kehete hai
 Electricity is also used practically to generate magnetic fields, because it can generate magnetic fields of far greater intensity than permanent magnets, and the field can be moved easily by varying the field current
 is prakaar janit voltata kaa niyantran saralata se kiya ja saktaa he
 Fields are magnets to generate magnetic fields, on which the field coil turns
 in kundaliyon main dhara ke pravaah se chumbakeey kshetra kii utpatti hoti he
 For a single sphere, the field magnets are shaped somewhat, and the armature rotates between them
 armechar tathaa kshetra chumbakon ke bich vaayu antaraal nunatam hona chahie, jisase kshetreey abhivah kaa adhikansh armechar chaalkon ko kaat sake or armechar main janit voltata adhiktam ho sake
 Current flow in the field coil is called excitation
 yah uttejan kisi bahari strot se sanyojit karne par kiya ja saktaa he athwa swayan usee janitr main utpann honevaali dhara kaa hi ek ansh uttejan ke liye bhi prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 a generator that is excited from an external source is called an external excited generator and a generator that uses part of the current generated in the same generator itself is called an automatic excited generator
 swat: uttejan kii pranaliyaan bhi kshetra kundali or armechar ke sayojanon ke anusaar bhinn bhinn hoti hai
 If the fields are connected to the coil armature in the range, it is called the range generator
 yadi donon main parshv sambandhan ho, to use shant janitr kehete hai
 If some spheres in the field of the field are related to the armature and some lateral to it, then such a generator is called a joint generator
 uttejan kii in vibhinn vidhiyon se vibhinn lakshan praapt hote hai
 The field current in the external excited generator does not depend on the armature current or the load current
 at: usamen janit voltata bhaar vicharan se swatantra hoti he
 If the field current is kept the same and the voltage generated in the generator will also remain the same
 shant janitr main bhi lagbhag aisa hi lakshan praapt hota he or bhaar vicharan kaa prabhaav janit voltata par adhik nahin hota
 In the range generator, the load current flows in the armature and field coils
 at:, yah kshetradhara bhaar par nirbhar karti he or is prakaar janit voltata bhaar badhane ke saath badhati jaati hai
 Combined generators have characteristics between shunt and range generators
 kshetra kundali ke shant or shrenee varton kaa vyavasthaapan kar unke bich kaa koi bhi lakshan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In practice only joint generators are used more
 chumbakeey kshetra main ekasmaan veg se ghoomanevaale chaalak main janit voltata, chaalak ke chumbakeey abhivah ko kaatane kii gati par nirbhar karti he
 This speed, in fact, depends on the position relative to the magnetic conductance of the conductor at any given moment
 jab chaalak ekasmaan veg se gum rahaa ho, to vah ek chakkar main do baar abhivah ke lambavat hoga or is sthiti main vah adhiktam abhivah kaatega, tathaa jab vah koi bhi abhivah nahin kaatega, do baar uske samaantar hoga
 Thus the voltage generated in a circle twice will vary between zero and maximum, as shown in Figure 3

 is prakaar ke vicharan ko prayavarti vicharan kehete hai
 a similar alternating voltage is produced in armature drivers, and a dichotomy is used to direct it
 dikparivartak armechar ke shaft par hi aropit hota he
 There are many copper blocks in it, which are insulated from each other
 armechar ke vartan ke antyasangyojan in khandon se sanyojit hote hai
 There are two burruses connecting with the transformer, which connect the current flowing through the voltage generated in the armature to the external circuit
 armechar chaalkon kaa dikparivartak se sangyojan is prakaar kiya jaataa he ki donon burushon dwaara ikatthi kii janevaali dhara ek hi disha kii hoti he
 Thus one Burush collects positive current and the other one negative
 is aadhaar par burushon ko bhi dhanatmak evam rinatmak kaha jaataa he
 In fact, Burush is the terminal of the electric current, which relates the load to the generator
 ye burushdharak par aropit hote hai or dikpavirthak par inaki sthiti burush dharak dwaara vyavasthaapit kii ja sakati he

 a Brahmin Kumar walks out of the house to do penance
 ek din ek chide ne udate-udate uske upar beeth kar diya
 When Beeth fell on her, when she saw him, she became irritated and fell down
 usne sochaa, ab maamla bana he, tapasya rang laai he
 From there he decided that now accomplishment was achieved
 vah ek basti main gaya or ek ghar main jaakar usne bhiksha ke liye ‘narayan hari’ kii awaz lagaai
 a mother gave a voice from inside - wait, Maharaj! i am coming now thodi der ruk gaya, phir awaz lagaai - ‘bhikshaan dehi
 'mother gave voice, Maharaj! Wait - I'm coming now
 thodi der rukaa, phir awaz lagaai
 Goddess again gave voice, Lord! i am requesting you, stay! i am coming now
 usko to apni tapasya kaa nasha tha
 He started saying, you don't know who i am, you are ignoring me? From inside she said that goddess, i know but you do not understand that i am that irritated whom you will see and it will burn
 main vah chida nahin, yaad rakho, khadey raho vahiin, abhi aa rahi hoon
 Now his intoxication of austerity has subsided
 uske man main aayaa ki isko ghar baithe kaise pataa chalaa ki jangal main main chida jala aayaa hoon
 After a while she brought alms
 brahman ne poocha - devi ! hamen bhiksha to baad main chahie, pehle yah hamen bataao ki tumhen kaise pataa chalaa ki main ne chide ko bhasma kar diya
 He said, i don't have much time to tell you
 aap apni bhiksha lijie or yadi aapako is vishay main jaananaa he to amuk shahar main chale jaaie, vahaan par ek vaisya rahete hai, vah aapako bataa denge
 From there he went to a Brahmin named Sudarshan
 nagar main vah vaisya ke paas gaya, vah apane vyavsaay main laga hua tha
 He looked and said come! Mr
 Pandit sit dawn! He sat down
 thodi der ke baad brahman kehane laga main aapse kuch poochna chahta hoon
 Vaishya said, yes - that woman has sent you to me because you have burned irritated
 abhi mere paas samay nahin, yadi bahut jaruri ho phir to aap yahan se chale jaaie
 There is a hunter in such a city, he will explain the whole thing to you
 yadi mere se hi samajhnaa ho to siankal tak intajaar karnaa padegaa
 The Brahmin was in a hurry, he says good! i go here only
 vah vyaadh ke paas gaya to vah maance kaat-kaat kar bech rahaa tha
 Huntsman said - Come Panditji! have a seat! Sethji has sent you
 koi baat nahin, viraajie
 I'm doing my work right now, I'll talk to you later
 brahman bada hairaan hua
 Now he sat there, started thinking, Now go nowhere, decision will be made right here
 siankal jab ho gayi to vyaadh ne apni dukaan band kii, pandit ji ko liya or apane ghar kii ore chal diya
 The Brahmin started asking the hunter which god you worship, which you have so much knowledge about
 usne kaha ki chalo vah dev main aapako dikhaa rahaa hoon
 When Panditji reached his house with great curiosity, he saw the old mother and father of the hunter sitting on a bed
 vyaadh ne jate hi unako dandwat pranaam kiya
 Their feet were washed, served and fed
 pandit kuch kehane laga to vyaadh bolaa - aap baithiye, pehle main apane devataaon kii puja kar lun, baad main aapse baat karunga
 May you be the first mother goddess and then be the father of the ancestors and be the master of the gods, then may you be the guest gods, your fourth number is God! Now that Brahmin started thinking that he is a knower of scripture
 jab brahman ne poocha ki aap itane bade tatvajna hokar ke itnaa nikrusht karm kyon karte hai to usne kaha - bhagwan! karm koi nikrusht nahin hota
 We were born here in Huntsman, my father also used to sell meat, his father also and we have got this business from our ancestors, so we do not hate it because as long as there is a meat eater in this world, then we sell it Gonna be too purvi timore kaa dhvaj purvi timore kaa rashtriya dhvaj he

 erik arikson ek america vikaas manovaigyanik evam manovishleshak the jinka janm germany main hua tha
 He is known for his psychosocial development theory
 15 june 1902 main paidaa hua tha or vah ek german mul ke america vikaas manovaigyanik or manovishleshak manushya ke manosamaajik vikaas par unke siddhant ke liye janaa jaataa tha
 He could be most famous for naming the phrase identity crisis
 unke putr, kaai

 arikson, ek prakhyat america samajashastri he
 Although Erickson also lacked a bachelor's degree, he served as a professor at major institutions such as Harvard and Yale
 general manovigyaan surveykshan kii samiksha, 2002 main prakashit, 20 veen sadi ke 12 wein sabase uddhrut manochikitsak ke rup main arikson sthaan par raheen
 Erickson's mother, Carla Ebrahmsen, comes from a prominent Jewish family in Copenhagen, Denmark
 vah yahudee share dalal valdemar isidor salomoncen se shaadi kii thi, lekin kai maheenon ke samay main erik kalpana kii thi ke liye uske paas se bichad gaya tha
 Little is known about Eric's biological father except that he was an atheist from Denmark
 uski garbhavastha kii khoj par, karla francfort, germany, jahaan erik 15 june, 1902 ko paidaa hua tha or sarnem salomoncen diya gaya tha ke liye bhaag gaye
 The development of identity seems to have been one of Ericsson's biggest concerns in his own life as well as in his theory
 ek puraane vayask ke rup main, vah apane kishor "pahchaan bhram" apane europea dinon main ke bare main likhaa tha
 "my identity confusion," he wrote was timely, "the boundary line between neurosis and adolescent mentality
 " arikson kii beti likhata he ki uske pita ke 'asli mano pahchaan "sthapit nahin kiya gaya tha jab tak ki vah" ke naam ke saath apane sautele pita ke upnaam kii jagah apane hi avishkaar 
 The favorable outcome of each stage is sometimes referred to as the "virtue," a term used in reference to Ericsson's work as it is applied to medicine, meaning 'power
 " arikson ke shodh se pataa chalata he ki prayek vyakti ko siikhnaa chahie ek duusare ke saath tanaav main prayek vishisht jivan-charan chunauti ke donon charam simaaon dhaaran karne ke liye kaise, tanaav yaa anya ke ek chor nahin khaarij
 Only when both extremes are understood and accepted in a life-stage challenge can both as necessary and useful, optimum virtue for the stage surface
 is prakaar, 'vishwaas' or 'galat vishwaas' donon ko samajha or yathartwaadee 'aashaa' pehle charan main ek vyavhaarya samaadhaan ke rup main ubharne ke liye aadesh main sweekaar kiye jate hai, kiya janaa chahie
 Similarly, both 'honesty' and 'disappointment' must be understood and action 'knowledge' embraced in order to emerge as a viable solution at the last stage
 arikson jivan charan punya, aath charnon main jo ve hasil kiya ja saktaa he ke kram main, kar rahe hai: 1) ASHA, Basic Trust vs
 Basic Distrust - This phase includes the childhood period, 0–1 years of age, which is in the most fundamental phase of life
 bachche buniyadi vishwaas yaa avishvaas buniyadi viksit chaahe poshan kaa keval ek maamla nahin he
 It is multidimensional and has strong social components
 2)marji, swaittata banaam bachapan ke aasapaas 1-3 varsh shame-cover
 Introducing the concept of shame and doubt versus autonomy
 bachche ko apane yaa uski swatantraaa kii shuruyaat kii khoj karne ke liye shuru hota he, or mata pita ke buniyadi kaary kar rahi ke bachche kii bhaavana kii suvidha chahie "sab khud / khud ko
 " 3)prayojan, pahal banaam aparaadh-purvaskuli / 3-6 saal
 The child has the ability to do things on his own such as dress him or herself, right? If "guilty" about making his or her own choices, the child will not act well
 4) kshamta, udyog banaam hinata-skool umr / 6-11 saal
 Hair self-worth than others

 5) Fidelity, Identity vs
 Role Confusion Teenagers / 12-18 years
 swayan kaa sawaal uthaaya
 Who am I, how do i fit in? Where am i going in life? Erickson believes that if parents give permission to locate the child, they will end their own identity
 6) pyaar, antarangta banaam algaav-yah vayask vikaas kaa pehla charan he
 This development usually occurs during young adulthood, which is between the ages of 18 35
 Dating, marriage, family and friendship are important during the phase in their lives
 safaltaapurvak anya logon ke saath prem sambandhon ke gathan karke, vyaktiyon pyaar or atmiyata kaa anubhav karne main sakasham hai
 Those who feel isolated from failed lasting relationships and form for May alone
 7) care, jeneretiviti banaam tehraav-vayaskta ke duusare charan main 35-64 kii umr ke bich hota he
 During this time, people are normally settled in their lives and know what is important to them
 8)buddhi, ahankaar akhandta banaam niraashaa-is charan main 65 or par ke aayu varg ko prabhavit karata he
 During this time a person has reached the last chapter in his life and is approaching retirement or has already taken place
 vanonmulan kaa arth he wanon ke kshetron main pedon ko jalaana yaa kaatna aisa karne ke liye kai kaaran hai; pedon or unase vyutpann charcol ko ek vastu ke rup main bechaa ja saktaa he or manushya ke dwaara upyog main liya ja saktaa he jabaki saafe kii gayi bhoomi ko charaagaah yaa maanav awaas ke rup main kaam main liya ja saktaa he
 Such cutting and re-planting of trees has resulted in damage to habitat, loss of biodiversity and increased dryness in the atmosphere
 saath hi aksar jin kshetron se pedon ko hataa diya jaataa he ve banjar bhoomi main badal jate hai
 Lack of awareness or disregard for intrinsic values, lack of responsive values, loose forest management and environmental laws allow deforestation on such a large scale
 kai deshon main vanonmulan nirantar kii jaati he jiske parinamswaroop vilopan, jalwaayu main parivartan, marusthalikaran or swadeshi logon ke visthaapan jaisi prakriyaayein dekhne main aati hai
 In simple words, deforestation occurs because forest land is not economically viable
 kheti ke liye bhoomi kii maatra ko badhane ke saath saath kashtha kaa upyog puure vishwa main 20 karod se adhik logon ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The estimated value of forests as a genetic resource has not been confirmed by any economic studies
 iske parinaam swarup van bhoomi ke maalik wanon kii safai nahin karne se nuksaan uthaate hai or yah puure samaaj ke kalyaan ko prabhavit karata he
 From the perspective of the developing world, the benefits of biodiverse sources and forests in the form of carbon sinks extend primarily to developed and wealthy nations and are not adequately compensated for these services
 jiske parinaam swarup kuch deshon ke paas bahut adhik van hai, vikasshil desh mahasoos karte hai ki viksit duniya main kuch desh jaise sanyukt rajya america, ne apane jangalon ko sadiyon pehle kaata or isse bahut adhik laabh uthaaya or vikaas sheel deshon ke liye samaan avasaron kaa khandan karnaa galat hoga
 That is, the poor people cannot even bear the cost of their protection, while the rich created this problem
 ek saamaanya samjhaute ke alawa ki vanonmulan bhoomi ke aarthik mulya ko badhaati he, is baat par koi samjhauta nahin he ki vanonmulan ke kya kaaran hai
 In some areas deforestation can be a direct source of wood and in some areas it may be an indirect source such as deforestation for the road to farmers who want to go for cleaning the forests: experts do not agree that wood For this, the cutting of trees contributes significantly to world-class deforestation
 or kuch kaa maananaa he ki lakdi ko kaatna vanonmulan ko kam karne main mukhya yogadan detaa he kyonki vikaas sheel deshon main lakdi ke bhandar prakritik sroton kii tulana main kahin zyada hote hai
 Similarly, there is no consensus on the fact that poverty is important in deforestation
 kuch logon kaa tark he ki garib log lakdi kaatane ko praathamikta dete hai kyon ki unke paas koi or vikalp nahin he
 Others believe that poor people do not have the necessary materials to clean forests and the ability to pay for labor
 jansankhya vruddhi vanonmulan ko badhaava detii he, is prakaar ke daawey kamjor hai or truti yukt aankadon par aadhaarit hai, jansankhya vruddhi ke saath vanonmulan kaa praathmik rup se badhanaa keval 8 pratishat maamalon main hi paaya jaataa he
 According to the FAO, the world-class deforestation rate is not related to data on the growth rate of human population, but is a result of lack of technological progress and inefficient governance
 There are many reasons at the root of deforestation, such as corruption and unequal wealth and capacity
 Distribution, population growth and overpopulation, and urbanization
 Globalization is often seen as a factor promoting deforestation
 britain ke paryaavaran vigyaani norman myrs ke anusaar 5 pratishat vanonmulan kaa kaaran he pashuon ke dwaara charaai, 19 pratishat vanonmulan lakdi ke liye kaate jane ke kaaran hoti he, 22 pratishat kaa kaaran he badhate hue tad ke tel ke liye vriksharopan or 54 pratishat kaa kaaran he slesh and bern prakaar kii kheti
 It is very difficult to obtain data on the rate of deforestation, if not impossible
 The FAO figures are largely based on the reports of forest divisions of different countries
 vishwa bank kaa anumaan he ki bolovia main vanonmulan ke 80 pratishat maamle or colombia main 42 pratishat maamle avaidh hote hai, jabaki peru main avaidh kataai sabhi kriyaaon ke 80 pratishat ke baraabar he
 For tropical countries, the estimate of deforestation is very uncertain: according to satellite images, the rate of deforestation in captions is 23 percent lower than the highest quoted rate
 or katibandhon ke liye vanonmulan kii sampoorn daren + / - 50 % tak galat ho sakati hai
 In contrast, a new analysis of satellite images shows that the rate of deforestation in the Amazon basin is two times the scientists' earlier estimate
 you en epa i o ke paas uplabdh vanonmulan ke sarvottam lambe samay ke aankde hai or inhen aankadon ke aadhaar par beesvin shatabdi ke madhya se lekar vaishvik jangal cover lagbhag sthir rahen hai
 ) And the global forest cover has increased since 1954 based on the longest available data
 vanonmulan kii dar main bhi kami aa rahi he
 The rate of cleaning of forests is decreasing every century
 vishwa str par vanonmulan kii dar 1980 ke dashak ke dauraan kam hui, 1990 main isamen or teji se kami ai
 or 2000 se 2005 tak or bhi adhik kami ai
 in pravritiyon ke aadhaar par aisi ummid kii jaati he ki vaishvik vanonmulan ke virdohi prayaas agali aadhi sadi main vanonmulan ko kam karenge saath hi vaishvik jangal cover 2050 tak 10 pratishat bad jaayegaa-jo bharat ke kshetrafal ke aakaar ke baraabar he
 The rate of deforestation is the highest among developing tropical nations, although the rate of loss of tropical forests globally is also decreasing, with annual 8
6 million hectares of annual tropical deforestation rates in 1990, compared to 9
2 million hectares in the last century
 Has also occurred
 eggeo ke aankadon kii upyogita par kuch paryaavaran samoohon dwaara vivaad he
 These questions are raised primarily because data does not differentiate between types of forests
 dar yah he ki ucch vividh nivas, jaise ushnkaribandheey varsha van main vanonmulan main vruddhi hogi, jo kam jaev vividh shushk, khule wanon ke prakaar main badi kami kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Due to this decrease, it is possible that many of the negative effects of deforestation such as loss of habitat are increasing despite decrease in deforestation
 kuch paryaavaran vigyaniyon kaa anumaan he ki yadi puraane wanon kii suraksha ke liye vishwa str paramahatva purna kadam nahin uthaaye jaayenge, to 2030 tak iskaa keval 10 pratishat hi shesh rah jaayegaa
 or bachaa hua 10 pratishat bhi khatm hone kii kagaar par hoga
 80 percent would have been lost
 or uske saath hi sankadon hajaaron prajatiyaan bhi vilupt ho jaayengi, jinaki kshatipurti asambhav hogi
 Despite the reduction in deforestation during the last 30 years, deforestation remains a serious global environmental problem and in many areas it remains a social and economic problem
 13million hectare kaa har saal nuksaan hota he, jisamen se 6 million hectare aise van hai jinhen maanav ke dwaara bade paimaane par nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya gaya he
 As a result, there is a decrease in habitat for wildlife as well as a reduction in the ecosystem services provided by these forests
 vanonmulan kii dar main ai giravat, pehle se hi vanonmulan se ho chuke nuksaan kii bharpai nahin karti he
 Deforestation on a global scale accelerated in the mid-1800s, and by 1947, the mature tropical tropical forest had cleared nearly half of the original 15 million to 16 million square kilometers, or 7
5 to 8 million square kilometers
 vanonmulan kii dar kshetra ke anusaar vyapak rup se bahut adhik bhinnata rakhti he
 Despite global shortages in some regions, deforestation rates are increasing, especially in developmentally warm tropical countries
 udhaaharan ke liye, nigeria ne apane puraane 81% wanon ko keval 15 saalon main kho diya
 The whole of Africa suffers from deforestation at twice the world rate
 vanonmulan ke prabhaav ushnkaribandheey varshaavan main sabase adhik spasht hai
 Brazil has lost 90–95 percent of its mother atlantika forests
 madhya america main tarai ushnkaribandheey wanon ke do tihaai bhaag 1950 ke baad se charaagahon main badal chuke hai
 Half of the Brazilian state of Rondonia, 243,000 km2 has been affected by deforestation in recent years
 or mexico, bharat, philippines, indonesia, thailand, myanmar, malaysia, bangladesh, china,srilanka, laos, nigeria, congou, liberia, gini, ghana or kot dilvoir sahit ushn katibandheey deshon ne apane varsha wanon ke bahut bade kshetron kaa nuksaan uthaaya he, kyonki kshetron main ye daren alag alag hai or vanonmulan kii daron main vaishvik kami aavashyak rup se yah suchit nahin karti he ki vanonmulan ke nakaaratmak prabhaav bhi kam ho rahen hai
 Large areas of Siberia have been watered since the fall of the Soviet Union
 pichley do dashakon main, afghanistan ne puure desh main 70 pratishat se adhik wanon ko kho diya he
 The trend of deforestation can be in accordance with the Kuznets curve, although even if this is true, it would be problematic on so-called hot spots because of the risk of asymptomatic damage to non-economic forest values
 vanonmulan jari he or jalwaayu or bhugolmen parivartan laa rahi he
 Deforestation contributes to global warming, and is a key factor in promoting greenhouse effect
 ushnkaribandheey vanonmulan duniya kii 20 pratishat greenhouse gas utsarjan ke liye uttaradaayi he
 According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, deforestation is responsible for one-third of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, mainly in warm tropical regions
 ped or anya podhe prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya ke dauraan vayumandal se carbon daai oxide ke rup main carbon ko hataa dete hai
 And release it again into the atmosphere during the process of normal respiration
 keval sakriy vruddhi ke dauraan hi ek ped yaa van ek saal yaa lambi avadhi ke liye carbon ko hataa saktaa he
 This accumulated carbon is returned to the atmosphere by decomposition or wood burning
 van carbon ko le saken iske liye lakdi ko lambe samay tak jivit rahane vaale utpaadon main badal diya janaa chahie or pedo ko phir se ugaana chahie
 Due to deforestation, carbon is released into the soil and accumulated

 Mature forests are a choice between a net sink and a net source of carbon dioxide, and the carbon cycle)
 ushnkaribandheey vanonmulan se utsarjan ko kam karne or vikaas sheel deshon main van avanaman ke kaaran jari jalwaayu nitiyon ko puraa karne ke liye nayi sambhaavnaaen utpann hui hai
 The idea behind this fact is to provide financial compensation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from deforestation and forest degradation "
 saamaanya vyaktiyo kaa maananaa he ki vishwa varsha van, vishwa main oxigen kii maatra main mukhya bhoomika nibhaate hai, haalaanki ab vaigyanikon ne sweekaar kar liya he ki varsha van vayumandal main bahut kam shuddh oxigen kaa yogadan dete hai
 And deforestation has no effect on oxygen levels in the atmosphere
 baharhaal, bhoomi ko saafe karne ke liye bhasmeekaran or wanon ko jalaana kai ton carbon daai oxide utpann karata he jo global varming main yogadan detii he
 Forests are capable of extracting carbon dioxide and pollutants from the air
 or is prakaar se jaev mandal kii sthirataa banaaye rakhane main yogadan dete hai
 The water cycle is also affected by deforestation
 ped apni jadon ke madhyam se bhoojal avashoshit karte hai or vaataavaran main mukt kar dete hai
 When a part of the forest is removed, the trees do not evaporate this water and as a result the atmosphere becomes dry
 vanonmulan mitti main jal kii maatra ko, bhu jal kii maatra ko or vaataavaran main nami kii maatra ko kam kar detii he
 Deforestation reduces soil fertility so that erosion, flooding, and landslides are fixed
 Forests promote recirculation of aquifers in some places, however, in most places forests are the main source of aquifer reduction
 wanon main kami avakshepan ke vashpotsargan rakh rakhaav ke liye sikuden or land scape kii kshamta ko cover karti he
 Instead of holding onto precipitation that penetrates the groundwater system, the forest-free zone becomes a source of surface water flow, which speeds up more rapidly than underground flow
 yah satahi jal kaa teevr pravaah flash baadh kaa kaaran ho saktaa he or is prakaar se van yukt kshetron main baadh kii sambhaavnaaen bad jaati hen
 vanonmulan vashpajalotsargan main bhi kami laati he, jo vayumandal main nami kii maatra ko kam karata he, jisase kuch maamalon main avakshepan ke str kam ho jate hai
 Since the water does not renew again in areas of low winds, it flows as a strong current and reaches directly into the sea
 ek praarambhik adhyayan ke anusaar, van rahit uttar or uttar pashchim china main, ausat vaarshik avakshepan 1950 se 1980 ke bich ek tihaai kam ho gaya
 Trees and plants in general greatly affect the water cycle
 iske parinaam swarup pedo kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti sataha par, mitti main yaa bhoojal main yaa vayumandal main jal kii maatra ko parivartit kar sakati he
 This in turn changes the rates of erosion and changes in availability of water either for ecosystems or for human services
 bahut adhik barish ke maamle main van baadh par bahu kam prabhaav daalate hai, jo van kii mrudaa kii sangrahan kshamta ko parajeet kar detaa he yadi mrudaa santrupt he yaa santrupti ke kareeb he

 kuch maamalon main, bahari mubir ko vittiya inaam dekar protsaahit kiya jaataa he
 Under most US federal informant statutes, a federal employee must believe that their employer has violated certain laws, rules, or regulations, certifying or initiating legal proceedings on a legally protected matter as an informant's order
 do; To reject or to violate the law
 kai maamalon main nirdisht kiya gaya he ki mukhabiri vishesh vishay par adhinium ke tahat surakshit he, america adaalaton ne aise mubir ko pratishodh se surakshit rakhaa he
 However, the closely divided US Supreme Court ruling, Garcetti v
 Saballos, was that the First Amendment guaranteed free speech to government employees that disclosures made within the scope of the employees' duty would not be protected
 mukhabiri ke bare main vichaar vyapak rup se bhinn hai
 The informer is usually seen as a martyr for public interest and organizational accountability; Secondly, in the form of 'stories of gossip' or 'chewing gourd', which is only about the pursuit of fame and personal glory
 kuch shikshavidon ke vichaaron se mubir ko kam se kam khandit pariklpana kaa hakdaar hona chahie taaki naitik siddhanton ko lagu karne ke prayaas main unhen dikkaton kaa saamana na ho or shashan pranali main mubir kaa adhik sammaan kiya janaa chahie agar naitik gunon main yah majboot shaikshanik aadhaar ho
 It is possible that many people stay away from whistleblowing not only because of feeling vengeful but also because of fear of losing relationships at work and outside
 kyonki zyaadaatar maamalon kii ruparekha nimna shrenee kii hoti he or saamanytah inhen media kaa dhyaan bahut kam yaa nahin ke baraabar praapt hota he or mubir kaa mahatvapurn kaam durvyavhaar kii soochna dena he jo ek prakaar se khatre kaa kaam he or aamtaur par jisamen mahima or prasiddhi kii maang kii dharna bahut kam hoti he
 The harassment of whistleblowers has become a serious issue in many parts of the world
 haalanki kanoon ke tahat mubir niyokta ke pratishodh se sangrakshit hai, phir bhi kai maamle hai jahaan mubir ko sajaa ke taur par aksar, samaapan, nilamban, padavnati, vetan kaa rukna or / yaa vahaan ke anya karmchaariyon dwaara durvyavhaar miltaa he
 For example, in the United States, most whistleblower protection legislation is limited, providing retaliation to the informant to provide "make hole" treatment or employment to compensate for the loss
 haalanki, kai hvisalbloar ne soochna di he ki nigamon yaa sarkari agenciyon main kadachaar ke abhiyog main vyapak rup se shoot da massenger kii maansikta apanaayi gayi he or kuch maamalon main mubir dwaara aarope lagaae jane par pratishodh kii bhaavana se aapraadhik abhiyojan kiye gaye hai
 In response, several private organizations formed legal rescue funds or support groups to support the informant; Two such examples are the National Whistleblower Center in the US and Public Concern at Work UK
 Depending on the circumstances, it is not uncommon for informants to be ostracized from their co-workers, discriminated against by future potential employers or even expelled from the organization

 udaatt kavyabhivyanjana ke vaishishty evam utkarsh kaa karantatv he jiskaa pratipaadan longinus ne apni kriti "periipsus" main kiya he

 Handwriting involves the scientific examination of handwriting, the main objective of which is to determine whether an article is written by a person
 lekhankala arjeet sampatti he, jise manushya abhyaas se praapt karata he
 Characteristics are generated in the article according to the writer's attitude and support of his muscles
 in visheshtaon ke kaaran prayek vyakti kaa lekh anya vyakti ke lekh se bhinn hota he
 Just as we can identify a man by looking at his general and specific characteristics, similarly we can identify him by comparing the general and specific characteristics of an article
 manushya ke rang, rup, kad aadi uske saamaanya lakshan hai tathaa massa, til, chot ke nishaan, aadi vishisht lakshan hai
 Similarly, the speed of the article, the smoothness of its flow, its inclination, skill and margin, the straightness of the lines, etc
 are its common characteristics and the different shapes of the letters are unique
 do lekhon ke inhen do prakaar ke lakshanon kaa milan karke visheshgy is nishkarsh par pahunchataa he ki unka likhanewaala ek hi vyakti he yaa nahin
 Specific traits, which we can also call personal characteristics, are of two types - direct and untouched
 pratyaksh visheshtaayen un prakat visheshtaon ko kehete hai jo saamaanya lekhanpranali se vishisht rup se bhinn hon, jaise kuch log aksharavishesh ko saamaanya aakaar kaa na banaakar kisi vishisht aakaar kaa banaate hai
 The 'indirect feature' in the article of the particular person will be said to be the characteristic which is not found again, which usually does not get attention
 kyonki inaki ore praaia: na us lekhak kaa dhyaan hota he jo apane lekh ko chhipaane ke liye bigaadkar likhata he, na us jaalsaaj kaa dhyaan hota he jo duusare ke lekh kii nakal chahta he, at: lekh ke pahchaanane main inkaa vishesh mahatv ho jaataa he
 Handwriting science also includes testing of writing materials and projections, that is, later extended, as they also help in solving the questions related to the article
 aajkal nyaayalay main yah vivaad bahudhaa uthaa karte hai ki amuk lekh kis vyakti kaa likhaa hua he
 There is a special need for a handwriting expert in such and other similar circumstances
 saamanyat: nyaayalay main kisi anya vyakti kii raay grahya nahin hoti he
 But in such a situation the opinion of the handwriting expert is admissible under Section 45 of the Evidence Act of India and has special significance
 ukt dhara 45 ke adheen un vyaktiyon kii raay bhi lee ja sakati he jo us vyakti ke lekh se suparichit hon or use pahchaanane main apane ko samarth kahen
 Handwriting experts were also there before, especially abroad
 ve praaia: aksharon kii banaavat ko dekhakar apni raay diya karte the, jiskaa koi vaigyanik aadhaar nahin hota tha or truti kaa paryaapt avasar rahata tha
 In the late 19th century scholars like AIIMS, Hagen, Asburn developed the art of handwriting recognition and brought it to the level of science

 However, India accepted being a member of the Commonwealth
 iske pashchaat, rashtramandal ke pramukh ke is pad ko ek gaiyr-rajatantric, aupchaarik adhyakshatmak upadi ke rup main sthapit kiya gaya tha
 Reportedly, the head of the Commonwealth has been considered "a symbol of the free co-operation of independent member nations"
 is upadi ko 1948 main rashtramandal ke pradhamantriyon kii baithak ke baad, landan ghoshnaa main prakalpit kiya gaya tha

 But India retained the membership of the Commonwealth
 uske baad se, rashtramandal deshon main, british samprabhu ko "rashtramandal ke pramukh" kaa pad bhi diya jaataa he, jo rashtramandal ke sanghathan kaa nammaatr pramukh kaa pad he

 avogadro kaa niyam gas se sambandhit ek niyam he jiskaa naam amedio avogadro ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 It is also known as "avogadro's Vision" and "avogadro's Theory"
 san 1811 main avogadro ne yah pariklpana prastut kii, jo is prakaar he - In 1811 AD, Italian chemist Avogadro explained the difference between atom and atom, stating that atom is the smallest particle of an element which participates in chemical activity and may or may not have independent existence
 anu padaarth kaa vah chote se chota kan he jisamen padaarth ke saare gun vidyaman hon or uskaa swatantra astitv sambhav ho
 Avogadro was the first to say that only the independent existence of molecules is possible in gases and not atoms, that is why the volume of a gas must be expressed by the molecules present in it
 is aadhaar par aavogadro ne nimnlikhit sambandh vyakt kiya he : Initially this relationship was called Avogadro's hypothesis, but later when it was tested by experiments it came to be called Avogadro's theory
 or ab ise 'aavogadro kaa niyam' kehete hai
 This rule is used in the modification of the atomic theory and in explaining the rule of Gelusak
 tathvik gaison kii parmanukta nikaalane main, anu bhaar gyaat karne main, gaison ke bhaar aaytan ke sambandh ko gyaat karne main tathaa gaison ke vishleshan main is niyam kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Number of Avogadro - The number of molecules in one gram molecular weight of any gas is the same
 is sankhya ko hi aavogadro kii sankhya kehete hai
 Its value has been fixed to 6
02x1023 by various methods
 aavogadro kii sankhya paanch vishwa sthiraanko main se ek he
 It denotes the Roman letter n
 hydrogen evam nitrogen ke samaan aaytan main anuon kii sankhya samaan hogi yadi ve ek hi taap va daab par rakhin ho tathaa adarsh gas ke samaan vyavhaar kar rahi hon
 In practice this rule is not completely true for real gases but is "almost true"
 jahaan: The most important conclusion of Avogadro's law is that the value of the ideal gas constant is the same for all gases
 arthath The value of is the same for all gases, irrespective of their size or mass
 yahan: One mole of an ideal gas occupies 22
