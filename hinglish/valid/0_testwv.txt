 One of the best leaders of the Indian Communist movement, the country's leading Marxist thinker and the creator of modern Kerala, Elmakulam Manakkal Sankaran Namboodiripad's personality was made up of a combination of high-level theoretical skills and activism

 Namboodiripad had a major role in making Kerala the leader of coalition politics

 In a period when most communist theorists were trying to see Indian history fit into the bookish Marxist mold, Namboodiripad demonstrated the unique originality and analyzed Kerala's social structure as 'caste-born-neduvazhi meritorious'

 For this reason, it takes a lot of data

 In this, it also unnecessarily keeps taking internet
 yadi aap internet kaa upyog bhi karte hai to yah windos ko nayaa rakhane ke liye nai fil aadi downlod karata hi rahata he

 iske dwaara yah microsoft ke store ko dikhaata he jahaan se aap nae anuprayog downlod kar sakate hai

 jaise kii yadi aap angrezi bhashaa main windos 10 praapt kar liye to usamen aapako hindi yaa anya bhashaa ke liye samarthan downlod karnaa padegaa
 You will have to download the font to see the characters of any other language
 isamen likhane aadi ke liye downlod kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 But if you receive it in a language other than English, then you will already have support for that language and English
 jabaki is tarah kaa samarthan puraane sanskaran main pehle se hi maujuud rahata he

 singhia jamalpur, munger, bihar sthit ek gaanv he
 The social reform movements in Bengal in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, the rise of patriot-nationalist consciousness and the unique progress made in literature-art-culture are called the renaissance of Bengal
 is dauraan samaaj sudhaarkon, sahityakaron or kalakaaron ne stri, vivaah, dahej, jatipratha or dharm sambandhi sthapit paramparaon ko chunauti di
 This development of Bengal left an indelible mark on the creations of the overall Indian modernity
 isi navajagaran ke dauraan bhartiya rashtrawaad ke shuruaati roopon kii sanrachanaayen saamne aayin
 The renaissance of Bengal is believed to extend from Raja Rammohan Roy to Rabindranath Thakur
 is avadhi kaa suvyavyasthit adhyayan karne vaale itihaaskaar sushobhan sarkaar likhte hai, ‘angrezi raaj, poonjividi arthvyavastha or aadhunik pashchimi samskruti kaa sabase pehla prabhaav bengal par padaa jisase ek aisa navajagaran hua jise aamtaur par bengal ke rinesaan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Bengal's conscious awareness of the changing modern world for almost a century was ahead of the rest of India
 is lihaaz se kaha ja saktaa he ki bharat ke aadhunik jaagran main bengal dwaara nibhaai gayi bhoomika kii tulana europee rinesaan ke sandarbh main italy kii bhoomika se kii ja sakati he
 'like the Italian Renaissance, the renaissance of Bengal was not a mass movement
 isaki prakriya or prasar bhadralok tak hi simit tha
 In Bhadralok too, the renaissance had its influence mostly on the Hindu part
 is dauraan kuch musalmaan hastiyaan bhi ubharin, par bengal kaa navajagaran aanshik rup se hi musalmaan navajagaran kaha ja saktaa he
 It is broadly believed that Bengal's renaissance began with Rammohan Roy and ended with Rabindranath Thakur
 sushobhan sarkaar ne ise paanch charnon main baant kar dekhne kaa prayaas kiya he : pehali avadhi 1814 se 1833, jisaki kendriya hasti raja rammohan raay the
 In 1814 he came to live in Kolkata and in 1833 he died in London
 duusari avadhi unki mrityu se 1857 ke vidroh tak jaati he
 The third period extends to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885
 chauthi avadhi 1905 main bengal ke vibhaajan tak or paanchavin avadhi swadeshi andolan se asahyog andolan or mahatma gandhi ke netritv kii shuruyaat tak yani 1919 tak maani gayi he
 There is a parable about Rammohun Rai that can be read as a metaphor for his personality
 kaha jaataa he ki unke do ghar the
 In terms of food, clothing and living, one used to live like a Victorian Gentileman and the other like a traditional Bengali Brahmin
 darasal, unke vyaktitv or krititv kii sabase badi visheshta thi purv or pashchim kaa sanshleshan
 However, this parable also does not define his stereotypical personality
 1820 main unki kriti ‘parasepts of jisas’ kaa prakaashan hua jisamen isa ke naitik sandesh ko isai tatvagyan or chamatkaar kathaon se alag karke pesh kiya gaya tha
 The Christian clergy class in Bengal was angered by his efforts
 uske virodh ke parinamswaroop rammohan raay ne isai janata ke naam teen apilen jari karke apane vichaaron ko or spashtataa pradaan kii
 Along with this, he also tried to highlight the ideological continuity of Hindu theism from the Vedas by publishing the Brahmanical magazine
 rammohan ne apane dharmik vichaaron ko dharti par utaarne ke liye 20 agast 1828 ko ‘brahm sabha’ kaa gathan kiya
 This process resulted in the establishment of a church in 1830 and the Brahmo Samaj movement began which continued to influence the consciousness of Bengali society for a long time
 1818 se 1829 ke bich rammohan raay ne sati pratha jaisi buraai par akraman karte hue teen rachanaayen prakashit kin
 His efforts are credited for creating public opinion against the practice of Sati and persuading the British to ban it
 rammohan ne aadhunik shiksha or vishesh taur se stri shiksha ke prasar main agua bhoomika nibhaai
 He is also called the creator of Bangla prose
 bengal rinesaan ke is daur main rammohan ke prayaason ko dohare virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 On the one hand he was opposed by anti-reform traditional writers and scholars like Radhakant Deb, Gaurikant Bhattacharya and Bhavani Charan Banerjee, while he also faced criticism from the French Revolution and English Radicalism which was led by 'young Bengal' and its anglo-indin The leader was in the hands of Henry Vivian Derozio
 yah alag baat he ki derozio ke anuyaayi apane kaamon or vaktrutaaon se samaaj ko chaunkaane ke alaava koi sthai asar nahin daal paye
 However, the soft program of social reforms based on Rammohan's tradition continued even after his death

 Meanwhile, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar campaigned against child marriage and polygamy
 haalaanki yang bengal andolan 1842 main vidhwaa vivaah ke paksh main awaz uthaa chukaa tha, par vidyasagar ke prayaason se hi ise lokapriy andolan kaa rup mila
 The renaissance of Bengal after the Revolt of 1857 entered the literary revolution and through it the era of nationalist thought
 nil kii kheti karwaane vaale angrezon ke julmon ke kilaaf kisaanon ke sangharsh main bengali buddhijiviyon ne bhi apni awaz milaayi

 Michaels announced the possibilities of a new Bengali poem in 1860 by creating Meghanad-slaughter
 1865 main bankim chandra chatarji kaa surya unke pehle aitihaasik upanyaas durgeshnandini ke saath bengali saanskrithik kshitij par uga
 In 1873 he started the tradition of social novels through poisoning
 1879 main ‘samya’ sheershak se niabandh likh kar bankim ne samtamulakata or utopian samaajwaad ke prati rujhaan dikhaaya, par 1882 main aanandamath likh kar ve deshbhaktipurna punarutthanavaad kii lahar main bah gayi
 The song 'vande Mataram' recorded in the same composition is one of the three national anthems of India
 saahitiyik unmesh ke saath- saath bengali navajagaran ne itihaas lekhan or samaaj-vigyaan ke anya kshetron main yogadan kii parampara kaa sutarapaat bhi kiya
 This period was particularly eventful in terms of religious reforms and revivalism
 ek taraf to keshav chandra sen ke netritv main yuva brahm samaji sudhaar andolan kii alakh jagaaye hue the, duusari taraf wahabi asantosh khadbada rahaa tha or nav- hinduvad kii padchaap sunaayi de rahi thi
 It was during this period that Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa of Dakshineswar declared all religious beliefs to be holy through his magnetic personality
 isai dharmantaran ko hawa dene vaala protestant ugravad isse kamazor hua or parampara ke pairokaron ko thodi raahat mili
 Swami Vivekananda, a young disciple of Paramahamsa, gained international fame from his speech delivered at the World Releases Conference in 1893 and formulated his particular style of idealistic nationalism
 chaar saal tak pashchim kaa daura karke laute to 1897 main unka rashtriya nayak kii tarah swaagat kiya gaya
 The period after 1861 was something in which the most favorite word of Bengali intellectual society became 'rashtriya'
 rajanarayan bose, navagopal mitra, jyotirindranath thakur or bhoodev mukherjee kii aguai main kai tarah kii gatividhiyaan chalin jinamein hindu meley kaa aayojan ullekhneey tha jo kareeb das saal tak kolkata ko aalodit karata rahaa
 The period after 1870 was a period of political movements in which the leadership of Surendranath Banerjee emerged who was known as the 'king of the Desolate of Bengal'
 surendranath ke jujharupan kaaran ke kaaran angrez unka naam bigaad kar ‘sarender note’ banerjee bhi kehete the
 In 1876, Banerjee founded the 'indin Association' whose 1883 national conference gave rise to the idea of creating a national organization for all Indians
 iskaa parinaam 1885 main bhartiya rashtriya congress kii aitihaasik sthapana ke rup main niklaa
 Bengali intellectuals participated fiercely in the activities of the Congress and by 1903 the presidency of the Congress sessions went to their account seven times
 bengal ne maharashtra or punjab ke saath mil kar congress ke garmdali dhade kii rachana karne main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaai
 The late period of Bengal's Navajaran was marked by dramatists like Girish Chandra Ghosh, historical and social novelist like Ramesh Chandra Dutt, Muslim poet like Mir Musharraf Hussain, Jagdish Chandra Bose and Prafulla Chandra Rai in Bankim's tradition
 lekin, rabindranath thakur kii pratibha ke saamne ye sabhi pratibhaaen feeki pad gayin
 Rabindranath, who attracted the attention of everyone by reciting his patriotic poems at the Hindu fair, gave a whole new era to his era by his creative and ideological literature
 unhone apane yug par aalochanatmak drushti phenki
 In 1901, through his creation Nishniad, he was seen to be attacking the advocates of Bengali Renaissance who were not ready to implement those ideals in their family life
 1913 main gitanjali ke liye sahitya kaa nobel puraskaar jeetne vaale rabindranath ne bang- bhang virodh or swadeshi andolan kii raajnneeti ko sarvatha naye drushtikon se dekha
 He expressed unhappiness over the negligible participation of Muslims in this movement and criticized the inauspicious dimensions contained in nationalism

 Law or law can be divided into individual method and territorial law - these two categories
 vaiyaktik vidhi se taatpary us vidhi se he jo keval kisi vyaktivishesh athwa vyaktiyon ke varg par lagu ho chaahe ve vyakti kahin par bhi rahete hon
 This method is different from the regional method which applies equally to all people within a certain region
 vaiyaktik vidhi kii vah pranali bharat main warren hestigs ne prarambh kii thi
 He prescribed Hindu law for Hindus and Muslim law for Muslims in certain civil matters
 yah vyavastha aaj bhi vidyaman he or hindu vidhi vivaah, dattakagrahan, sanyukt parivaar, rin, bantwaaraa, daay tathaa uttaradhikaar, stridhan, poshan or dharmik dharmasvon ke maamalon main hinduon par lagu he
 The first system of exercise of judicial rights by the East India Company was made in 1661 by the charter of Charles II
 1726 ke charter dwaara presidency vaale teenon nagaron main meyar ke nyaayalayon kii sthapana kar di gai
 The law that these courts thought to be in practice was the law of England which applied equally to both the country and the foreigners
 iske kaaran logon ko kathinaayee hui or yah prashn uthaa ki england kii vyavhaar vidhi ko bharatiyon par lagu kiya jaae yaa nahin
 The Charter of 1753 clearly provided that the courts of mayors are not to hear of the indictments of the Indians unless both parties, with their consent, submit these indictments for the decision of the mayor's courts
 
 is vyavastha ke bare main morle dwaara yah kaha gaya he ki yah unki apni vidhiyon kaa pratham aarakshan he
 The principle of this system was adopted by Warren Hastings and the 1772 plan provided that in all matters relating to marriages, caste and other religious practices or rituals, the Qur'an law for Muslims and the method given in the scriptures for Hindus
 Will always be supported
 aise kanoon kaa uddeshy yah tha ki bharat ke logon ko apane purvajon kii un vidhiyon ke adheen rahane kaa ek avasar diya jaae jinke ve abhyast the or jine saath unka anek prakaar se gathbandhan tha
 Hastings was convinced that the imposition of a code based on an external legal system would result in massive failure
 is yojana kaa vishesh pahalu iskaa simit swaroop he
 Individual law was confined to special subjects only, such as dyya, marriage, caste and religious laws
 iske atirikt hindu or musalmaan vibhinn sampradaayon tathaa upsampradaayon main vibhakt hai
 Hindus are divided into various groups, such as Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists
 musalamaanon ke shia or sunni ye do mukhya sampradaay hai
 The Shea method and the Sunni method differ greatly
 jahaan tak unpar unki vaiyaktik vidhi ke lagu kiye jane kaa sambandh tha, yah baat puri tarah se spasht nahin thi ki in vibhinn sampradaayon kii kya sthiti rahegi
 Over time such questions arose and were settled only by the courts
 raja didaar hossain banaam rani juhurunnusa ke maamle main privi concil ne yah vyavastha di thi ki shia log apni shia vidhi ke anusaar nyaay praapt karne ke adhikari hai
 Hastings's system of 1772, which prescribed individual laws for Hindus and Muslims, would have been impossible to operate with the help of British judges only because they were unfamiliar with Indian languages, the practices of Indians, and their conventions
 There was no knowledge
 at: hestings ne nyaayik pranali ko chalaane ke liye in nyaayadhishon ko un bhartiya vidhi adhikariyon, kaajiyon or panditon kii sahaayta uplabdh karai jinka kaam in vidhiyon ke siddhanton kii vyakhya un nyaayadhishon ke samaksh karnaa tha
 The British judges never believed the Indian law officers who were believed to commit corruption and take bribes
 is sambandh main keval ek yahi chaara rah gaya tha ki anbhavi tathaa yogya bhartiya vidhishastriyon kii sahaayta se hindu tathaa muslim vidhi ke purna niabandh taiyaar karke unka angreji main anuwaad karaayaa jaae
 Therefore, efforts were made to ensure and define the principles of Hindu and Muslim law
 in prayatnon ke falswaroop pehle pahal hindu vidhi sambandhi helhid kii samhita taiyaar hui
 Similarly, he prepared the Persian version of Arabic "hidaya"
 isi prakaar shanai:shanai: vaiyaktik vidhi ke sambandh main angreji ke prasiddh vidwaanon dwaara rachit kai anya uttam pustaken saamne ai
 But no reservation was made in the area of penal law
 muslim dandvidhi main, jo us samay lagu thi, baari pavirthan kiye gaye or yah vidhi dandsamhita, 1860 tathaa dand-prakriya-samhita, 1861 ke pravartan tak lagu rahi
 These Acts nullified the existing laws at that time and these Acts were implemented to all without discrimination of caste, creed and religion
 haalaanki hinduon tathaa musalamaanon kii vidhiyon ko vivaah, dattakagrahan, daay aadi maamalon main banaae rakhaa gaya tha, tathaapi yah anubhav kiya gaya ki hindu vidhi kii pracheen pranali badalte hue jamaane ke anukool nahin he
 Hence, many such laws were made by which individual laws were made to suit the needs of society
 is sambandh main hindu vidhi main sanshodhan karanevaala pehla mahatvapurn adhinium vah tha jisamen "sati" pratha kii samaapti kii vyavastha kii gai
 Several laws were enacted to improve the social status of women
 1856 main hindu vidhwaa punarvivaah adhinium paarit kiya gaya jiske dwaara hindu vidhwaa ke punarvivaah ko vaid bana diya gaya
 The Special Marriage Act of 1872 made such Hindus eligible to marry under this Act to declare that they do not believe in Hinduism
 is adhinium main 1937 ke arya vivaah vaidhikaran adhinium main yah vyavastha kii gai ki aise vyaktiyon ke bich sabhi vivaah vaid honge jo vivaah ke samay aryasamaji honge chaahe vivaah se purv ve bhinn jatiyon ke hon athwa bhinn dharm ko maanate rahe hon
 The rigid Hindu laws related to marriage were changed by these laws
 1946 ke hindu vivaahita pruthak nivas tathaa poshan adhikaar adhinium dwaara katipay paristhitiyon main hindu vivaahita ko pruthak nivas tathaa poshan kaa adhikaar de diya gaya
 The Hindu Knowledge Achievement Act of 1930 defines the rights of a member of a Hindu undivided family to the right to inherit on the strength of his knowledge
 daay ke kshetra main bhi kai parivartan kiye gaye
 The Hindu Right Act would give preference to certain close brothers over the inheritance for the property of a Hindu male who is exempted from the right of certain disenfranchised heirs
 1937 ke hindu stri sampatti adhikaar adhinium dwaara sandayata, bantwaare or daay ke sambandhit hindu vidhi main sanshodhan kiya gaya tathaa striyon ko or adhik adhikaar die gaye
 These acts influenced the orthodox system of Hindu law in many respects but no radical changes could be made
 angrej prashaasak vaiyaktik vidhiyon main parivartan karne se darate the
 He was of the view that interfering with the laws related to the right, marriage, etc
 would be deemed to interfere in the religion of the country as both are closely related and may cause anger in the country but after independence the situation changed
 
 vaiyaktik vidhiyon ke samhitakaran ke liye kai thos kaaran the
 In 1941 a committee was appointed to consider Hindu law
 isane yah sifarish kii ki vidhi kaa kramik avasthaaon main samhitabaddh kiya janaa chahie
 In 1944 another committee named Rao Committee was appointed
 is samiti ne apana prativedan prastut kiya or samhita kaa ek praaroop upasthit kiya
 The Hindu Law Bill, which stood before Parliament for a long time, was abandoned due to stiff opposition
 antatogatva yah nishchay kiya gaya ki apekshit vidhaan ko kishton main prastut kiya jaae
 Thus the Hindu Marriage Act was created in 1955 and the Hindu Succession Act, Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act and the Hindu Adoption and Nutrition Act were passed in 1956
 hindu vivaah adhinium ke dwaara hinduon main vivaah sambandhi vidhi main sanshodhan kiya gaya tathaa ise samhitabaddh kiya gaya
 It has also simplified the terms and requirements of a valid Hindu marriage
 iske dwaara dwivivaah ko dandaneey aparaadh bana diya gaya he
 The rules relating to repatriation of marriage rights, judicial separation and the inability of marriage and divorce were also laid down by this Act
 1956 ke hindu uttaradhikaar adhinium ke dwaara hinduon main ichhapatraheen uttaradhikaar sambandhi niyamon main ugr parivartan kiye gaye hai
 The Act provides for a uniform system of Dya and applies equally to persons regulated by Mitakshara and Dya Bhaga
 mitakshra dwaara sweekrut vaarison kii teen shreniyan, jaise gotraj sapind, samaanodak or bandhu tathaa daybhag dwaara sweekrut vaarison kii teen shreniyon jaise sampid, sakulya or bandhu ab nahin rahi he
 Now the heirs have been divided into four categories which are as follows prathmat : sampatti anusuchee ke varg 1 main die gaye vaarison ko milti he
 And if there is no such heir, then the heirs of the second, third and fourth categories get it
 ab purush tathaa stri vaaris samaan samajhe jane lage hai
 The property held by a Hindu woman will be her ultimate property
 us adhinium dwaara stridhan sambandhi uttaradhikaar se sambandhit kanoon main bhi sanshodhan kar diya gaya he
 The method of adoption and nutrition has been codified by the Hindu Adoption and Nutrition Act
 pichhali vidhi ke anusaar putree ko god nahin liya ja saktaa tha parantu is adhinium main ladakon tathaa ladakiyon donon ke god liye jane ko vyavastha he
 a Hindu woman has also been given the right of adoption by this act
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki uparyukt adhiniyamon se hindu vidhi kii roodhiwaadee pranali main baari parivartan hua he
 In the 1772 scheme of Warren Hastings, arrangements were made to apply the Quranic statutes to Muslims in all matters relating to marriage, caste, and other religious practices
 kanoon dwaara kiye gaye kuch parivartanon ke alaava yah yojana aaj bhi bahut kuch waisi hi he
 The first significant change in this regard was made by the Waqf Act of 1913
 1937 main sharia adhinium paarit kiya gaya
 The purpose of this act was to reestablish Muslim law for all Muslim sects
 khoja tathaa memon jaise kuch sampradaay aise the jinhone hindu dharm ko chhodkar islam ko grahan kar liya tha
 Even after conversion, these sects did not completely abandon Hindu law
 kuch maamalon ke bare main unka viniman hindu vidhi dwaara hota tha kyonki vah unki rudhvidhi thi
 The Sharia Act of 1937 applies to every Muslim, irrespective of any denomination
 iske do varsh pashchaat ek anya adhinium, muslim vivahaviched adhinium, 1939 paarit kiya gaya
 This act empowered the Muslim wife to be judicially separated from her husband
 in adhiniyamon se muslim vidhi main kisi had tak parivartan to hua, parantu jo parivartan hue hai, ve aparyaapt hai
 The society was different from modern Indian society when the ancient system was developed
 ab saamaajik vaataavaran tathaa aarthik paristhitiyon main parivartan ho jane ke kaaran aisa prathit hota he jaise is vidhi ke kuch niyam aaj kii saamaajik paristhitiyon se mail na khate hon
 Therefore, it has become necessary to make such a change in this method that it can prove useful in today's conditions, needs and requirements

 The International Energy Agency states that: First-generation technologies emerged from the industrial revolution at the end of the 19th century and include hydropower, biomass combustion, and geothermal power and heat
 Some of these technologies are still in widespread use
 Second-generation technologies include solar heating and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics
 These are now entering markets as a result of research, development and demonstration investments since the 1980s
 The initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the continuing appeal of these renewables is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits
 Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials
 Third-generation technologies are still under development and include advanced biomass gasification, biorefinery technologies, concentrating solar thermal power, hot dry rock geothermal energy, and ocean energy
 Advances in nanotechnology may also play a major role
 First and second generation technology has entered the market and third generation technology is entirely dependent on long-term research and development commitments where the public sector has to play its role

 Transferring this energy from the existing infrastructure to the demanding areas like urban centers will be an extremely inefficient and difficult task
 In addition, only 20 percent will remain eligible for inclusion in the grid, regardless of the amount of renewable energy produced or the economic feasibility of such technologies
 To achieve more sustainable energy, it is imperative for the United States to implement a plan to improve the power grid, which will result in adjusted fuel economy
 haalanki, in vitaran samasyaon ko dur karne kii pahal ke liye kai prastaav die ja rahe hai
 First of all, the United States needs to try to reduce CO2 emissions and slow down the pace of global warming in the most effective way through conservation
 amenriki vidyut grid ke maujuuda virodhiyon ne bhi grid ke vikendrikaran kii vakaalat kii he
 This system will increase efficiency by reducing the amount of energy lost in transmission
 It will also be economically viable as the quantity of power lines being built will be reduced keeping in mind the demand
