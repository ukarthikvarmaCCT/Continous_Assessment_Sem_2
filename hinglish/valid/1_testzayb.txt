 Somi Ali is an actress in Hindi films
 yunaan kii bhoomi darshan ke liye bahut urvar rahi he
 Many scholars believe that Greek philosophy has left an indelible mark on the entire western mind
 unani darshan ko teen bhaagon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he
 The first part is the views of those who were Greek, but lived in Greek settlements outside Greece
 sophist sampradaay ke vichaarkon or sucraat ke saath ethns darshanashastra kii rajdhani bana
 Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle gave Greek philosophy its maturity and left an indelible mark on Western ideology
 arestu ke baad, pracheen darshan neeche kii ore ludhakne laga
 In the place of independent thought, the arrangement of Plato and Aristotle became the goal of deliberation
 unani darshan kaa janm ionia main hua
 Thales Anaximander and Anximiniz revealed their ideas about the basic elements of creation
 teenon kii dharna ek hi thi ki mul tatv ek he or bhautik he
 Thales gave water, Enaximander gave latent nature, and Anaximinize gave Vayu the basic element
 prayek bhautik padaarth main gun or maatra pratyaksh dikhte hai
 Ionia thinkers paid attention to virtue and ignored quantity
 pithegaras ne maatra ko satta kaa tatv samajha
 The quantity is checked on the foundation of the unit and is the basis of the number
 pithegoras ke anusaar sankhya satta kaa tatv he
 In this way, he entered the abstract into philosophical discussion
 pithegoras ke vicharanusaar sristi main anurupata or saamanjasy har ore dikhte hai
 This analogy is famous in singing, the equivalence of number is the life of the raga
 nakshatra apni gati main madhur dhwani utpann karte hai, yadhyapi ham use sun nahin sakate, kyonki uski tivrata hamaari shravanshakti kii simaaon main nahin aati
 Parmenidis and Hieraclitus presented an important controversy in the philosophy of the festival from Socrates
 parmenidis ne gun kii tarah maatra kii bhi upeksha kii or swayan satta yaa "sat" ko mul tatv ke rup main dekha
 This "satta" is monotonous, has no change, it is infinite, indivisible, unconnected with country and time
 "asat" main in sab gunon kaa abhaav he
 The origin is a combination of "sat" and "assat"
 hireclits na kaha ki parivartan satta kaa tatv he, satta udbhav ke atirikt kuch nahin
 Both these thinkers made the suffixes of "sat" and "revelation" a central question in philosophical discourse
 hireclitas ke pravaahvaad ke virodh main, parmenidis ke shishy jino ne yah bataanaa chaha ki gati yaa parivartan kii to sambhaavna hi nahin, tir prati kshan kisi na kisi bindu par sthit he, do binduon par ek saath to ho nahin saktaa
 Two more names are of importance in the first era of ancient Darshan
 demacraitis ne kaha ki padaarthon main gunbhed un parmaanuon ke pariman, aakaar or sthaan par nirbhar he, jinke sanyog se padaarth banate hai
 In a way, Dimacritus's atomism was the syncretism of goodism and flowism: atoms are the truth, their coincidental flow is expressed
 eneccegoras ne kaha ki achetan prakruti sristi kii vyavastha kaa samaadhaan nahin kar sakati; is samaadhaan ke liye chetana kii aavashyaktaa he
 The loss of consciousness was a significant change in creation
 peeche arestu ne to kaha ki madiraa pie hue logon main aneccegoras hi saavdhaan tha
 The first part of Greek philosophy put the following suffixes in front of thinkers - 1
 sristi kaa mul tatv, 2
 sat or udbhav, satta or prakaashan 3
 rachana main chetana kaa sthaan It is clear that later interpretation could not ignore any of these suffixes
 safist samudaay or sucraat ke saath unani darshan athens main aa pahunchaa
 Till now philosophy was understood in the sense of philosophy, now policy and knowledge metamorphosis also joined with it
 donon ke sambandh main safist vichaarkon or sucraat ke drushtikon main moulik bhed tha
 Protagoras said that humans are the measure of all things
 prayek manushya ke liye vahi satya he jo use indriyon dwaara gyaat hota he, prayek ke liye vahi shubh he jo use priy lagata he
 Socrates said that according to this description, truth and auspiciousness does not exist
 yadi har ek manushya keval apane bodh or apni pasand ke vishay main kahata he, to satya or shubh ke sambandh main do manushyon main matbhed ho hi nahin saktaa
 Socrates said that truth and good are the same for all
 is vivaad ne darshanik vivechan main saamaanya or vishesh ke pratyayon ko pravisht kar diya
 In relation to policy, Socrates said that knowledge and truthfulness are the same thing
 iskaa arth yahi nahin ki koi karm shubhakarm nahin hota, jab tak ki karta ko uske shubh hone kaa gyaan na ho, apitu yah bhi ki aisa gyaan hone par vyakti ke liye anivaary ho jaataa he ki vah us karm ko kare
 Bad karma is ignorant karma at every stage
 sucraat naitik pratyayon kaa yatharth lakshan karnaa chahta tha or iske liye usne aagaman kaa prayog kiya
 Socrates' greatest contribution to philosophy was that he made the work of Plato and Aristotle possible
 donon sucraat ke bataae maarg par chale or unke dwaara saare uttarkalin vivechan par sucraat ke vichaaron kii chhap lag gai
 Plato occupies the summit in ancient Western philosophy
 sucraat ke atirikt parthenidis or hireclitas ke vichaaron main bhi plato ke drushtikon ko nirnit karne main bhaag liya
 Under the influence of Socrates, he understood the importance of the suffixes and gave them the post of power of the Parmenides
 drusht jagat ko usne hireclitas ke udbhav ke rup main dekha
 The final power is that of general or suffixes, particular substances are incomplete imitations of a suffix
 yah plato kaa vikhyath pratyay siddhant he
 Among these suffixes, the fundamental and major suffixes are the suffixes of shreya or auspiciousness
 niti main sachharitrataa kaa swaroop nirnit karne main plato ne vyakti ko samaaj kaa ek nanha namoona samajha
 Auspicious feelings of the person are compatible with the needs of the society
 usne vivek, saahas, sanyam or nyaay ko mukhya sadbhaawanaaon kaa pad diya
 The meaning of justice was that the other three circles should remain in their respective regions and be harmonious in life
 gyanamimasaa main usne gyaan ko teen staron par rakhaa
 At the lowest level is knowledge of special objects
 aise gyaan main vastuon kii dasha, madhyam or gyaata kii samayik avasthaa kaa prabhaav padataa he
 It cannot be said that those who see a particular substance see it in the same form
 plato aise gyaan ko sammati pad detaa he
 The knowledge gained from mathematics is at a higher level than the knowledge of a particular substance
 ham kisi vishesh trikon ko lete hai parantu jo kuch siddh karte hai vah sabh trikonon ke vishay main maanya hota he
 Represents the specific common wh
 sab se unche str par darshanik vivechan he, isamen kel saamaanya vichaar kaa vishay hota he
 In reality, this realization is entitled to be called knowledge
 plato ne apane pratyay siddhant ko apane sanvaadon main satta or jivan ke vividh pakshon par lagu kiya
 "republik" is prominent in these dialogues
 kuch aalochakon ke vichaar main, anya sanvaadon main ham plato ko kisi ek paksh main dekhte hai, "republic" main samast plato ko dekhte hai
 Plato sought to present a broad view of the world
 gyanendriyaan to is sambandh main kuch bataa nahin saktin
 Plato's sense of disrespect towards what she says
 arestu kii prakruti isse bhinn thi, vah tatvat: vaigyanik tha
 The scientist has special significance and he takes the shelter of sense perception to know it
 arestu ne "nyaay" se aarambh kiya; bhautikee, niti, raajnneeti or kala par likhaa or ant main tatvagyan par ek apurna granth likhaa
 Critically criticized each theory of plates in philosophy
 plato ne kaha tha ki kisi shrenee ke sabhi vishesh padaarth ek hi saamaanya yaa pratyay kii apurna nakalen hai
 There will be duplications, but how did this vision come into the world
 pratyayon main to parivartan hota nahin, ve apni purna yaa apurna nakalen nahin bana sakate
 Even if the copying has become somehow, then the real world will exist - the speed or change remain a mystery
 plato ne kaha tha ki saamaanya shrenee ke visheshon main antar hota he or isiilie ek shrenee ke vishesh duusari shrenee ke visheshon se bhinn hote hai
 Aristotle gave special importance to the person
 vyakti saamagree or akruti kaa mail hota he
 The initial material was latent in nature, it had no shape
 vikaas main akruti saamagree ko apni kriti se vishesh rup detii he
 The difference between high and low in materials depends on the extent to which the shape can affect the material
 sansar main sab kuch aage bad rahaa he, peeche se dhakela nahin jaataa, aage se aakrisht ho rahaa he
 The attractive power is a pure figure, which Aristotle gives the name of God
 niti main, arestu ne plato kii tarah moulik sadbhaawanaaon par vichaar nahin kiya, usne saamaanya sadbhaavna kaa swaroop nirnit karnaa chaha
 He came to the conclusion that Shubh or Bhadra is the intermediate position in the two extremes
 ghrushtataa or kaayarta donon avagun hai; inke madhya main saahas he jo sadachaar he
 Etiquette is the stage between indecency and slavery
 is samaadhaan se shubh or ashubh kaa bhed maatra kaa bhed ban jaataa he
 It is often considered a qualitative distinction among philosophers
 bhalaai or buraai bhinn prakaar kii vastuen hai
 Socrates stressed the definition of suffixes
 arestu ne nigaman nyaay kaa nirmaan kiya or tanik bhed ke saath nigaman aaj bhi arestu kaa nigaman nyaay hi he
 Authenticity is the major thing in estimation
 hamen dekhnaa hota he ki uttarapakshon ko sweekaar karne par ham kis nishkarsh ko sweekaar karne par baadhit ho jate hai
 In sentences, any sentence that has internal opposition becomes essentially invalid
 darshan main arestu kii pramukh dein dravya kaa pratyay he
 As such he has described the 10 final aspects of power, but in reality they are matter and its properties
 jaisaa ham dekhenge, dravya kaa pratyay darshanik vivechan main chir kaal tak vichaar kaa kendriya pratyay bana rahaa
 Kranti Veer Singh arestu ke saath pracheen darshan kii praudhata kaa kaal samaapt hota he
 a few years after his death, Zino and Epicurus laid the foundations of two new ideologies almost simultaneously
 donon vichaaron main nyaay, bhautikee or nitidarshan ke teen bhaag he
 Both were Aristotle's followers in justice
 praakrit jagat main donon apratihat shashan sweekaar karte the
 Both have historical significance regarding policy
 vivaad kaa mukhya vishay bhoga yaa tripti kii sthiti he
 According to Epicurus this satiety is the only value in life
 maansik tripti kaa pad shaareerik tripti ke pad se unchaa he, kshanik tripti se sthaayee tripti adhik moolyavaan he
 Simplicity, restraint, finiteness are very helpful for a happy life
 yah epicuras kaa mat or aacharan tha, parantu uske anuyaayiyon ke liye moulik siddhant bahut prabal siddh hua
 If satisfaction in life is the only thing of value, then it should be obtained in as much quantity as it can get, as soon as possible
 saadhaaran logon ke liye epicurian siddhant yahi ho gaya- "khao, piyo or prasann raho" adham avasthaa main yahi jeevandarshan hota he
 This suited the situation in Greece, while remaining there for a while
 zino ke vichaar ke anusaar jivan kaa akelaa mulya sadachaar he
 The element of virtue prevails over impulses
 iske liye do baton kii aavashyata he- sukh or du:kha donon se manushya upar uth sake
 According to the Stoic idea, the basic formula in life is - endure suffering, indulge in enjoyments
 yah vichaardhaara yunaan kii tatkaaleen sthiti ke anukool na thi, vahaan se rome main pahaunchi, jahaan ise uchit vaataavaran mil gaya
 Roman heroism and Stoic attitudes became synonyms
 rome main stoic vichaardhaara ko kai yogya prasarak mil gaye
 Among them, Epicitus and Emperor Marcus Aurelius are famous
 stoic vichaar jivan ko maanav prakruti ke anukul bananaa chahta tha; is prakruti main buddhi mukhya ansh he or acha jivan vahi he jisamen buddhi kaa shashan ho

 aryaashtangmarg mahatma buddha kii pramukh shikshaaon main se ek he jo dukhon se mukti paane evam aatm-gyaan ke saadhan ke rup main bataaya gaya he
 All the 'routes' of the Ashtanga Marg begin with the word 'samyak'
 buddha pratikon main praayah ashtaang margon ko dharmachakr ke aath tadiyon dwaara nirupit kiya jaataa he
 Part of the category of buddha dharm ke anusaar, chauthe arya satya kaa arya ashtaang maarg he - dukh nirodh paane kaa rasta
 Gautama Buddha used to say that to follow the truth of the Four Noble Truths, one should follow this path: kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha said that craving is the root cause of all sorrows
 trishna ke kaaran sansar kii vibhinn vastuon kii ore manushya pravrutt hota he; or jab vah unhen praapt nahin kar saktaa athwa jab ve praapt hokar bhi nasht ho jaati hai tab use du:kha hota he
 a creature who dies with craving, still takes birth from his inspiration and keeps grinding in the misery of the world
 at: trishna kaa sarvatha prahaan karne kaa jo maarg he vahi mukti kaa maarg he
 This is called grief-prevention-gamini pratipada
 bhagavan buddha ne is maarg ke aath ang bataae hai : The first two parts of this path are of Pragya and the last two are of Samadhi
 bich ke chaar sheel ke hai
 In this way, Sheel, Samadhi and Pragya become the input of the eight organs in these three
 sheel shuddh hone par hi aadhyatmik jivan main koi pravesh paa saktaa he
 Mumukshu meditates on the basis of pure modesty and avails samadhi and in samadhistha state, he is interviewed with truth
 ise pragna kehete hai, jiske udbuddha hote hi sadhak ko satta maatr ke anitya, anaam or du:khaswaroop kaa saakshaatkaar ho jaataa he
 Its ignorance is destroyed in the light of wisdom
 isse sansar kii sari trishnaayen chali jaati hai
 Veetrishna, he does not ego anywhere and happiness rises above the bond of sorrow
 is jivan ke ananthar, trishna ke na hone ke kaaran, uske phir janm grahan karne kaa koi hetu nahin rahata
 Thus, the sheela-samadhi-pragyawala route divided into eight limbs is called the Arya Ashtanga path

 Tapasya tapa originally meant light or ignition which was evident in the sun or fire
 kintu dhire-dhire uskaa ek roodharth viksit ho gaya or kisi uddeshy vishesh kii prapti athwa atmik or shaareerik anushaasan ke liye uthaae janevaale daihik ksht ko tap kaha jane laga
 In fact, the development of the spirit of asceticism was the result of the development of the doctrine of the four Purusartho and the four Ashramas
 ye sabhi vichaar uttar vaidic yug kii hi dein hai or yadi rugveda main tapas kaa koi vishesh ullekh na mili to isamen aashcharya nahin
 Yes, that form of tapas, which is tantric and guhyak and whose purpose is to harm another or to protect oneself from the attack of another, the Shudra must be affected by the non-aryan elements
 mulat: moksh kii prapti kaa icchhuk sanyasi hi tapascharya main rat hua
 His discussions begin in Brahmins and Upanishads and attainment of Brahm becomes his objective
 sarvaswatyag uske liye aavashyak mana gaya or yah samajha jane laga ki sansar main avaagaman ke bandhanon se mukt hone ke liye vairaygy hi nahin naitik jivan bhi aavashyak he
 Therefore, not only the renunciation of all the comforts of life, the body also started burning or tormenting it in many ways
 kuch videshi vidvan tapasya main nihit vichaaron ko arya or vaidic na maanakar avaidic adivaasiyon kii dein maanate hai
 But this does not seem right
 anarya or avaidic tatv dhire-dhire vaidic samaaj ke shudra varg main samahit ho gaye, jinhen tapasya kaa adhikaar pracheen dharm or samaaj ke netaaon ne diya hi nahin
 Even ascetic Shudras like Shambuk, who were doing the opposite, were punished
 yadi tapas kii vichaardhaara kaa prarambh un anarya tatwon se hua hota to yah paristhiti asambhav hoti
 a variety of forms and forms of austerity were considered due to differences in motives
 vidyadhyaayi brahmacharee, putrakalatra, dhansampatti tathaa aihik sukhon ke icchhuk grihasth, paramatma kii prapti, brahm se leen or mokshalabh kii ichha se prerit sanyasi manobhilashit var athwa stri chaahanewaale vyakti, bhagwaan main leen bhakt evam devidevataaon kii krupa chaahanewaale sarsaadhaaran stripurush, swadharm or saadhaaran dharm kaa paalan karne vaale saadhaaran jan aadi anek prakaar ke log bhinn bhinn roopon main tapas kaa sinddhant maanate or uskaa prayog karte
 The center of asceticism was to torment the body
 uske jitne hi bahuvidh rup hue athwa kathorta badi, tapas kaa utana hi charmotkarsh mana gaya
 The ordinary ascetic was limited only to the practice of vatkālādā ,ā, bhātīैयाāya, snacking, jātāgādā, नa, nā ,hādhā वेa, vedocharan, yajnākāvikā औरa, and kindness, but in the hot summer heat, panchagni, revelation in the rain, jalānivāsa in winter, or living in wet clothes, Three times bathing, Kandamulashan, begging, abstaining from the habitation and giving up all the comforts of the body and giving it trouble, is a symptom of penance Did not know shiv ko praapt karne ke liye parvati kii tapasya iskaa pramukh udhaaharan he
 Not only this, with one posture, namely - holding hands, walking or wearing other metaphors of the same kind - maintaining it for a few days or a lifetime, Tama's climax started to be considered
 aaj bhi aise anek tapasvi or hathyogi bharatvarsh ke sabhi konon, visheshat: tirthon, ashramon, nadi ke kinaaron or parvaton kii kandaraon main milenge
 The general public and sometimes the intelligent but also faithful and respectable society, have been respecting such ascetics and have also believed in emanating any superhuman or spiritual power
 kintu samalochak buddhi se yukt buddhijivi varg ne usapar kitni aasthaa rakhi he yah kah sakna kathin he
 The people of Western countries recognize that the Pauravayas have an infinite capacity to absorb suffering and physical heat and try to rise above or avoid it by torturing themselves in retaliation for subjugation, material tyranny and injustice
 shopenhaar ke man se isi kaaran purv ke deshon main ek nirashavad or dukhwad kaa janm hua, jiske parilakshan the sansar kaa tyaag, sanyas, sadhu jivan, sharir ko ksht dena or ichchhaaon ke daman kii aprakritik or amanovaigyanik pravriti
 But it seems that these thinkers do not pay as much attention to the prophetic psychological and pure physical analysis behind the accomplishment of meaning in the goals of Indian life, as in the sense of self-reliant salvation and its attainment
 isi drushti se tap kaa jo saamaajik vishleshan manusmriti main miltaa he vah chintya he
 Accordingly, the tenacity theology of the Chaturvarnayas is prescribed by their karma, such as the attainment of knowledge through Brahman, the protection of society through Kshatriya, agriculture, cow protection and commerce through Vaishya and service of the two-nation through Shudra
 saamaajik dashti se yah swadharm- apane kartavyon kaa paalan - hi sabamein mahatvapurn tap tha
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the philosophical aspect of asceticism and asceticism is seen as the best and its physical, speech and mental and satvic, majestic and tamasic forms are described

 Venus has many volcanoes like the Earth and some 167 large volcanoes in every 100 km radius
 prithvi par is aakaar kii jwalamukhi jatilta keval hawaii ke bade dweep par he
 This is not because Venus is more active than Earth from a volcanic point of view, but rather its crust is older

 The reason for the fall on the moon is progressively tucker, while on the earth it is due to wind and rain erosion
 shukr par lagbhag 85% cretar pracheen haalat main hai
 The number of craters, together with their well-protected conditions, indicates the planet's passing under a global reestablishment event some 30–60 million years ago, followed by a collapse in volcanism
 jahaan ek ore prithvi kii parpati nirantar prakriyaarat he, vahiin shukr ko is tarah kii prakriya ke poshan ke liye asamarth samajha gaya he
 Without plate tectonics, Venus undergoes a cyclic process to disperse heat from its mantle in which the mantle temperature rise continues until it reaches the peak level necessary for the weakening of the layer
 Then, over a period of about 10 million years, pressure occurs on a large scale that completely recycles the crust
 shukr cretaron ke paraas vyas main 3 kimi se lekar 280 kimi tak he
 There is no crater less than 3 km due to the effect of dense atmosphere on visitor bodies
 ek nishchit gatij urja se kam ke saath aane vaali vastuon ko vayumandal ne itnaa dhimaa kiya hai ki wein ek prahaar cretar nahin bana pate he
 Projections less than 50 km in diameter will be fragmented and consumed in the atmosphere before they reach the surface

 The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests that they share the same internal structure: a core, a mantle, and a crust
 prithvi par kii hi tarah shukr kaa kor kam se kam aanshik rup se taral he kyonki in do grahon ke thande hone kii dar lagbhag ek samaan rahi he
 The slightly smaller size of Venus suggests that the pressure in its deep interior is much lower than the Earth
 in do grahon ke bich pramukh antar he, shukr par plate tectonix ke liye pramaan kaa abhaav, sambhawatah kyonki isaki parat kam chipchipa banane ke liye bina pani ke apharan ke liye bahut majboot he
 This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a possible explanation for the lack of internally generated magnetic field
 baavjud, shukr pramukh punarsatahikaran ghatnaon main apni aantarik ooshmaa bich bich main kho saktaa hai
 Venus' atmosphere is extremely dense, consisting mainly of carbon dioxide and a small amount of nitrogen

 The density on the surface is 65 kg / m3
 The co2-rich atmosphere here, along with dense clouds of sulfur dioxide, produces the most powerful greenhouse effect of the solar system and produces surface temperatures of at least 462 ° C
 yah shukr kii sataha ko budh kii tulana main zyada tapt banaata he

 Winds on the surface are slow, moving only a few kilometers per hour, but because of the high density of the atmosphere on the surface of Venus, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions and transport dust and small stones across the surface
 is
 yah akelaa hi isse hokar maanviya chahal kadami ke liye mushkil khadi karata hoga, anyathaa garmi, dabaav or oxigen kii kami koi samasya nahin thi
 Above the dense CO2 layer are thick clouds consisting mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets
 ye badal lagbhag 90% surya prakaash ko paravartit va bikherte he jo ki waapas antariksh main un par girtaa he or shukr kii sataha ke drishy prekshan ko rokte he
 The permanent covering of clouds means that even though the planet Venus is closer to the Sun than the Earth, the surface of Venus is not well lit
 badalon ke sheersh par kii 300 kimi / ghanta kii shaktishaalee hawaaen har chaar se paanch prithvi divaso main grah kaa chakkar lagaati he
 Venus's winds are up to 60 times its rotation, while Earth's fastest winds are only 10% to 20% of its rotation speed

 " 1967 main venera 4 ne shukr ke chumbakeey kshetra ko prithvi kii tulana main bahut kamjor paaya
 This magnetic field is induced by an interplay between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than an internal dynamo, like the inner core of the Earth
 shukr kaa chota sa prerit chumbakeey kshetra vayumandal ko brahmadia vikiran ke khilaaf naganya suraksha pradaan karata he
 This radiation may be the result of lightning discharge from cloud to cloud

 On Venus, a global reabsorption event may have closed the plate tectonics and caused a decrease of heat flow through the crust

 As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field
 iske bajaay, kor se nikalne vaali tapiya urja bhupatal ko dobaaraa garm karne ke liye baar-baar istemaal hui he
 One possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core, or that its core is not currently cold, so the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature
 ek or sambhaavna ki iskaa kor pehle se hi puri tarah jam gaya he
 The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is currently unknown
 shukr ke irdagird durbal chumbakeey aavaran kaa matlab he saura vaayu grah ke bahya vayumandal ke saath sidhe sampark karti he
 Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are formed by the dissociation of neutral molecules from ultraviolet radiation
 saura vaayu phir urja kii aapurti karti he jo inamen se kuch yanon ko grah ke chumbakeey kshetra se palaayan ke liye paryaapt veg detii he
 This degradation process results in the loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, while maintaining high-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, in much the same way
 saura vaayu dwaara vayumandaleey ksharan grah ke gathan ke baad ke arabon varshon ke darmyaan jal ke khone kaa shaayad sabase bada kaaran bana

 In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini reported the Moon orbiting Venus, which was named from the Neith
 After the next 200 years, many sightings were reported
 But most were determined to be nearby stars

 As an inferior planet, it is always within about 47 ° from the Sun
 surya kii parikrama karte hue shukr prayek 584 diwason par prithvi ko paar kar jaataa he
 As it appears, it changes from "twilight star" after sunset to "dawn star" before sunrise
 ek anya avar grah budh kaa prasarkon maatr 28° ke adhiktam tak pahunchataa he or godhuli main praayah mushkil se pahachaanaa jaataa he, jabaki shukr ko apni adhiktam kanti par chuk janaa kathin he
 Its maximum maximum angle means it is visible in the dark sky till just after sunset 
 akaash main ek chamakdaar bindu sadrishy vastu ke rup main shukr ko ek "agyaat udan tastari" maan lene kii sahaj galat bayani hui he
 In 1969, US President Jimmy Carter reported seeing a flying saucer, an analysis of which later suggested the possibility of being a planet
 Countless others have mistaken Venus to be extraordinary
 jaise hi shukr kii apni kaksha ke irdagird halchal hoti he, doorabeen drushyavali main yah chandramaa kii tarah kalaon kaa pradarshan karata he: shukr kii kalaon main, grah ek choti si "purna" chhavi prastut karata he jab yah surya ke vipareet disha main hota he, jab yah surya se adhiktam kone par hota he ek badi "chaturthans kala" pradarshit karata he, evam ratri akaash main apni adhiktam chamak par hota he, tathaa jaise hi yah prithvi or surya ke madhya samipsth kahin aasapaas aata he doorabeen drushyavali main ek bahut bada "patala ardhchandra" prastut karata he
 When Venus lies between the Earth and the Sun, it is at its largest size and presents its "nav Kala"
 iske vayumandal ko grah ke chaaron ore ke apavartit prakaash ke prabhamandal dwaara ek doorabeen main dekha ja saktaa hai
 Venus's orbit is slightly tilted relative to the Earth's orbit; Therefore, when this planet passes between the Earth and the Sun, it usually does not cross the face of the Sun
 shukr pargaman karnaa tab paaya jaataa he jab grah kaa avar sangyojan prithvi ke kakshiya tal main upasthiti ke saath mail khaataa he
 Transits of Venus occur in 243-year cycles
 pargaman kii vartmaan paddati me, pehle do pargaman aath varshon ke antaraal main hote he, phir kareeb 105
5 varshiya yaa 121
5 varshiya lanbaa viraam or phir se vahiin aath varshiya antaraal ke nae pargaman jodo kaa daur shuru hota he
 This form was first discovered in 1639 by the British astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks
 naveenatam joda 8 june,2004 or 5-6 june 2012 ko tha
 Transit could be viewed directly from multiple online outlets or locally with appropriate equipment and conditions
 pargaman kii purvavarti jodi disambar 1874 or disambar 1882 main hui; aagaamee jodi disambar 2117 or disambar 2125 main ghatit hogi
 Historically, the transit of Venus was important, as they have allowed astronomers to directly determine the size of the astronomical unit, as well as the size of the solar system, as seen by Horrocks in 1639 by Captain Cook's Eastern Australia
 The discovery of the coast was made possible when he traveled to Tahiti in 1768 after a voyage to observe Venus transit
 tathakthith bhasmavarn prakaash lambey samay se chalaa aa rahaa shukr prekshanon kaa ek rahasy he
 Bhasmavarna Prakash is a subtle light on the dark side of Venus and is visible when the planet is in crescent phase
 is prakaash ko sarvapratham dekhne kaa daawa bahut pehle 1643 main hua tha, parantu roshni ke astitv kii bharosemand pushti kabhi nahin ho pai
 Observers have speculated that this could be a result of electrical activity in Venus's atmosphere, but it could be misleading
 ho saktaa he yah ek ujjwal, arddh chandrakaar aakaar kii vastu dekhne ke bhram kaa nateeja ho
 The planet Venus was recognized by ancient civilizations in both the "morning star" and "evening star" forms
 naam se hi purv samaj jaahir hoti he ki wein do alag-alag vasteen thi | ammisaduka kii shukr patalika, dinaankit 1581 ipu, unani samaj dikhaati he ki donon vastu ek hi thi
 Venus is referred to in this table as the "bright queen of the sky" and this view has been supported with detailed observations
 chhathi shatabdi isa purv main pithagoras ke samay tak, unaniyon kii avadharana, phosphorus or hesperas, ke rup main do alag-alag sitaron kii thi
 The Romans have designated the morning aspect of Venus as Lucifer and the evening aspect as Vesper
 shukr ke pargaman ke pratham darj avlokan kaa sanyog 4 disambar 1639 ko yirmayaah horokes dwaara, unke mitra wiliam crebtry ke saath-saath, bana tha
 In the early 17th century, when the Italian physicist Galileo Galilei made his first observation of the planet, he found it showing the moon-like arts, from crescent to ornate to full moon and vice versa
 jab yah surya se sarvaadhik dur hota he apana ardhachandra rup dikhaata he or jab surya ke sabase najadik hota he yah arddh chandrakaar yaa poornachandra kii tarah dikhataa he
 This was possible only if Venus orbited the Sun and was one of the first observations to explicitly refute Ptolemy's geocentric model, in which the solar system was centered and the Earth was at the center
 shukr ke vayumandal kii khoj 1761 main roosi bahushrut mikhail lomonosov dwaara hui thi
 The atmosphere of Venus was observed in 1790 by the German astronomer Yohan Schroter
 shroter ne paaya ki grah jab ek patala ardhchandra tha, katori 180° se adhik tak vistaarit hui
 He correctly surmised that this was due to scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere
 baad main, jab grah avar sangyojan par tha, america khagolashastri chester smith liman ne iske andhkaar taraf vaale hisse ke irdagird ek purna challe kaa nirikshan kiya or isane vayumandal ke liye pramaan pradaan kiye
 The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schröter incorrectly estimated periods of about 24 hours from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface
 20 veen sadi tak shukr ke bare main thodi bahut or khoj hui thi
 Its nearly featureless DSK gave no clue as to what its surface might be
 iske or adhik rahasyon kaa pardaaphos, spectroscopy, radar or parabangnee prekshanon ke vikaas ke saath hi hua
 The first ultraviolet observations were made in the 1920s when Frank E
 Ross found that ultraviolet photographs showed much more detailed detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation
 unhone suzav diya aisa nichle pile vaataavaran ke saath uske upar ke pakshabh megh ke atyadhik ghaneypan kii vajah se tha
 Spectroscopy observations in the 1900s gave the first clue about the rotation of Venus
 vesto slifer ne shukr se nikle prakaash ke dopler shift ko maapne kii koshish kii, lekin paaya ki vah kisi bhi ghurnan kaa pataa nahin laga sake
 He speculated that the planet must have a very long rotation period
 1950 ke dashak main baad ke kaary ne dikhaaya ki ghurnan pratigaami tha
 The Venus's radar observations were first made in the 1960s, providing the first measurements of the rotation period, close to modern values
 1970 ke dashak main radar prekshanon ne pehali baar shukr kii sataha ko vistrut rup se ujagar kiya
 Pulsions of radio waves were transmitted to the planet using a 300-meter radio telescope at the Eresibo Observatory, and the echoes detected two highly reflective regions designated from the alpha and beta regions
 prekshanon ne parvaton ke liye uttaradaayi tehraye gaye ek ujjwal kshetra bhi pataa lagaaya, ise maxwell montes kaha gaya tha
 On Venus, now these are the only three landmarks that do not have female names
 shukr ke liye, vaise hi kisi bhi anya grah ke liye, pehla robotic antariksh yaan mishan, 12 farvari 1961 ko venera 1 yaan ke prakshepan ke saath aarambh hua
 It was the first vehicle under the Soviet Venera program
 venera 1 ne mishan ke saatve din sampark kho diya, tab vah prithvi se 20 lakh kimi kii duuri par tha
 The United States' exploration for Venus also started in a bad state, with the Mariner 1 vehicle missing at the launch site
 par iske anuvarthi meriner 2 ne safalataa pai
 With its 109-day orbit, on 14 December 1962, it became the world's first successful intercontinental mission to pass 34,883 km above Venus

 In fact, Mariner 5 was originally created as a backup to Mariner 4, which is related to Mars
 But when the mission was successful, the vehicle was converted for the Venus mission
 Its equipment pairs were more sensitive than those on the Mariner 2
 vishesh rup main iske radio prachhaadan prayog ne shukr ke vayumandal kii sanrachana, dabaav or ghanatv ke data preshit kiye
 The combined data of the Venera 4-mariner 5 were analyzed over the next year in a series of formal conversations by a joint soviet-american science team
 yah antariksh sahyog kaa ek praarambhik udhaaharan he
 Following the lessons learned from Venera 4, the Soviet Union launched the twin vehicles Venera 5 and Venera 6 in a five-day interval in January 1969
 shukr se inkaa saamana usee saal ek din ke aad main 16 va 17 may ko hua
 The crushing pressure limit of the vehicle was increased to 25 bars and equipped with small parachutes to achieve a faster descent
 baad ke, shukr ke haal ke vayumandaleey modelon ne sataha ke dabaav ko 75 or 100 baar ke bich hone kaa suzav diya tha
 Therefore, there was no hope for these vehicles to survive on the surface
 After transmitting atmospheric data for a short interval of 50 minutes, both the ships were destroyed at an altitude of about 20 km before hitting the surface of the night side of Venus
 venera 7 ko grah ke sataha se nikle data ko waapas laane ke prayaas ke liye pesh kiya gaya
 It was manufactured with a strong descent module capable of withstanding 180 bar pressure
 modul ko pravesh se pehle thanda kiya gaya, saath hi 35 minute ke tej avataran ke liye ise ek vishesh rup se sametane vaale parachute ke saath las kiya gaya tha
 It continued to enter the atmosphere on 15 December 1970, while the parachute is believed to have partially exploded and the probe hit the surface with a loud, but not fatal
 shaayad yah apni jagah par jhuk gaya, kuch kamjor sanket preshit kiye or 23 minute ke liye taapmaana data kii aapurti kii jo kisi anya grah kii sataha se praapt kii gai pehali durmiti thi
 The Venera program continued with Venera 8
 After entering the atmosphere on 22 July 1972, it sent data from the surface for 50 minutes
 Venera 9 entered the atmosphere on 22 October 1975
 Whereas Venera 10 entered the atmosphere exactly three days after that on 25 October and sent the first pictures of Venus landscape
 Both vehicles presented very different scenarios in their immediate vicinity
 venera 9 ek 20 degree kii aisi dhalaan par utraa tha jahaan chaaron ore 30-40 semi ke pathar bikhare hue the | venera 10 ne mausami saamagree sahit besalt-prakaar ke betaratib shilakhandon ko dikhaaya
 Meanwhile, the United States sent Mariner 10 on a gravitational catapult trajectory whose path traveled through Venus to the planet Mercury
 5 farvari 1974 ko meriner 10 shukr se 5,790 kimi najadik se gujara or 4,000 se zyada tasveeron ke saath waapas lautaa
 It had achieved the best pictures ever, showing Venus almost featureless in visible light

 The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe left a total of four probe vehicles that entered the atmosphere on 9 December 1978 and transmitted data on its composition, winds and heat wastes
 agle chaar varshon main chaar or venera lander mishnon ne apni jagah le lee
 Of which Venera 11 and Venera 12 detected the electrical storms of Venus, and Venera 13 and Venera 14 descended on 1 and 5 March 1982 in a four-day time and sent the first color photographs of the surface
 sabhi chaar mishnon ko upree vayumandal main gatirodh ke liye parachute ke saath tainaat kiya gaya tha, lekin 50 kimi kii oonchai par unako mukt kar diya gaya, kyonki shukr kaa ghanaa nichalaa vayumandal bina kisi atirikt saadhan ke aaramdaayak avataran ke liye paryaapt gharshan pradaan karata he
 Both Venera 13 and 14 analyzed on-board soil samples with an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and attempted to measure soil compaction with enthalpy collisions

 On 11 and 15 June 1985, two spacecraft of the Vega program on the road to Haley dropped one Venera-style entry and a balloon-supported aerobot was released within the upper atmosphere
 gubbaaron ne 53 kimi ke kareeb ek santulit oonchai hasil kii, jahaan dabaav or taapmaana tulanaatmak rup se prithvi kii sataha par jitna hota hai
 Both remained operational for about 46 hours and found Venus's atmosphere more turbulent than previously believed
 The turbulent atmosphere here refers to high winds and powerful convection chambers

 Water resources are sources of water that are useful to humans or are likely to be used
 pani ke upyogon main shaamil hai krishi, audyogic, gharelu, manoranjan hetu or paryaavarniya gatividhiyon main
 Virtually all of these human uses require fresh water
 prithvi par pani kii kul uplabdh maatra athwa bhandar ko jalmandal kehete hai

5% of this earth's terrain is in the form of brackish water in the oceans and only 2
5% is fresh water, two-thirds of that is stored in glaciers and polar areas in the form of snow sheets and snow caps
 shesh pighla hua meetha pani mukhyatah jal ke rup main paaya jaataa he, jis kaa keval ek chota sa bhaag bhoomi ke upar dharatleey jal ke rup main yaa hawa main vayumandaleey jal ke rup main he
 Freshwater is a renewable resource because it is naturally purified in the water cycle, yet the world's clean water sufficiency is steadily declining, in many parts of the world, water demand is already exceeding supply and as such The population is increasing at an unprecedented rate in the world, the imbalance in the near future is expected to increase
 pani ke prayoktaaon ke liye jal sansadhano ke aavanton ke liye fremawork jal adhikaar ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Today the scarcity of water resources, its degradation and its related tensions and conflicts are important issues in world politics and national politics
 jal vivaad rashtriya or antarrashtriya donon staron par mahatvapurn vishay ban chuke hai
 Surface water or surface water is the water found on the surface of the earth that is flowing in streams or rivers or in wetlands of freshwater, ponds and lakes or fresh water following a gradient under the influence of gravity

 However, in any regional water system, the natural source of water is precipitation and its quantity depends on the geographical location and size of that basin
 iske alaava ek jal tantra main pani kii kul maatra kisi bhi samay anya kai karkon par nirbhar hoti he
 These factors include storage capacity in lakes, wetlands and artificial reservoirs; The permeability of the soil beneath these deposits; Characteristics of surface runoff within the basin; The duration, intensity and total volume of precipitation and the level of local evaporation, etc

 Humans often increase the amount of runoff and its speed by fixation of floors and waterways
 kisi bhi samay pani kii kul uplabdh maatra par dhyaan dena bhi jaruri he
 Many of the water uses by humans are for a fixed and short period of time in a year
 udhaaharan ke liye anek kheton ko vasant or greeshm ritu main pani kii badi maatra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or sardiyon main bilkul nahin
 To provide water to such a farm, a vast storage capacity of surface water would be required which would collect water throughout the year and flow it at the short time when it was needed
 vahiin duusari ore kuch anya upyogon ko pani kii satat aavashyaktaa hoti he, jaise kii vidyut sanyantr jis ko thanda karne ke liye lagaataar pani chaiye
 To supply water to such a power plant, it would be necessary to store only the same amount of water flowing on the surface so that it can provide water for cooling to the power plant even in the event of reduced water in the river
 dirghakaal main kisi basin ke andar varshan dwaara pani kii kitni maatra kii poorti kii jaati he yahi us basin kii maanav upyogon hetu jal uplabdhta kii upree seemaa hoti he

 This is quite important in Karst regions and Terai region
 bhoojal yaa bhumigat jal mithe jal kaa hissaa he jo mitti or chattaanon ke randhrakashon main sthit hota he
 It is also the water flowing below the water level within the aquifer
 bhoojal ke is pravaah ko adhopravaah kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes the water just below the surface is found in ground water and the water found in extreme depths is also called geological water or fossil water

 Therefore, ground water is also similar to ground water in many ways: In the context of exchange and storage in the water system, if it is compared to the ground water, the important difference is that due to the slow movement of land, the groundwater reserves are usually They are larger and more permanent than surface water
 is antar ke kaaran maanav aasaani se bhoojal kaa lambe samay tak bina gambhir parinaamon ke gaiyr dirghakaalik upyog kar sakate hai
 However, it is also important to note that once the groundwater is polluted, the process of clearing it by natural rotation is even slower
 vilwanikaran ek kritrim prakriya he jiske dwaara khaaraa pani or ulat paraasaran hai
 At the moment, desalination is a very expensive option compared to other alternative sources and only a very small fraction of the total human use is accomplished by it, it is only useful in economically sound practical-value areas or arid regions

 Water used for recreation is usually a very small but growing part of the total water use
 manoranjan main pani kaa upyog adhiktar jalaashyon, kshiprikaon, jharanon or saahasik khelon se judaa hua he
 If the water level in a reservoir is kept higher than normal, its use for recreational consumption can be classified as a renewable or renewable use
 kuch jalaashyon se jal nirgaman shwet jal ke rup main drushyavlokan or rafting ityadi manoranjak kaaryon ke liye samaybaddh kiya jaataa he jo manoranjak upyog mana ja saktaa he
 Other examples are skiers, nature enthusiasts and swimmers who use water in this form
 aadhunik sabhyataa main water park jaisi suvidhaayen bhi isi shrenee main gini ja sakati hai
 Recreational use is usually non-toxic
 golf course pani kii atyadhik maatra kaa upyog karne ke liye prasidd he, visheshkar khushk kshetron main
 However, it is unclear what direct effect the use of water for recreational irrigation has on water resources
 aisa kaaphi had tak vishwasaneey data ke abhaav ke kaaran he
 Some governments, including the California government, have described water use in golf courses as agriculture so that environmentalists do not call it a waste of water
 Although using the data above as a basis, the actual statistical effect of this manipulation is close to zero is believed
 iske atirikt, manoranjan main upyog anya upyogkartaaon ke liye vishisht samay or sthanon par pani kii uplabdhta main kami kaa kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 For example, maintaining a water reservoir for sailing in the late summer and not being available to farmers during the spring season farming would be of such use
 shwet jal rafting ke liye jal nirgaman bijli kii maang ke vyastatam samay par panbizli utpaadan ke liye jal kii anuplabdhta main parinat ho saktaa he
 Use of water for clean environment is also a very small use but increasing percentage of total water use

 Like the use of recreational means, environmental use is non-decaying but may cause a decrease in water availability to other users at specific times and locations
 udahaaran ke liye jalashay se machhlee udyog ke liye jal mukti ke baad pani upree kheton ke liye uplabdh nahin hoga
 The concept of water crisis and water stress is simple: according to the World Trade Council for Sustainable Development it applies to situations where there is not enough water available for all uses whether they are industrial, agricultural or domestic uses

 Poverty alleviation rates are increasing, especially among two population giants such as China and India
 baharhaal, badhati samruddhi kaa matlab he nishchit rup se adhik pani kii khapat
 This prosperity will only increase the demand for water, from 24 hours, 7 days of fresh water requirement and basic sanitation to the demand for water for garden irrigation and washing of the car, to the desire for jacuzzi or private swimming pool
 tezi se ho rahe audyogikaran se seva kshetra jaise paryaton or manoranjan jaisi vyavsaayik gatividhiyaan teji se vistaar kar raheen hai
 This expansion results in an increase in water services including supply and sanitation which may be due to further pressure on water and natural resources and ecosystems

 Water stress has often been a cause of conflict at the regional and local levels
 jal tanaav sangharsh or raajnneetik tanaav ko bhi badhaava de sakate hai chaahe vah pani se sambandhit na bhi hon
 Over time, the quality or quantity of fresh water can also be a hindrance to economic growth and increase regional instability, eroding the health of the population

 An ecosystem is a natural unit that includes all organisms of a particular region, ie plants, animals, and molecules that interact with their abiotic environment to form a complete biological unit
 is prakaar paaritantr anyonyashrith avyavon kii ek ikai he jo ek hi awaas ko baantate hai
 Ecosystems usually form numerous food webs that show the interdependence of these organisms and the flow of energy within the ecosystem
 paristhitiki tantra shabd ko 1930 main roy clafam dwaara ek paryaavaran ke sanyukt shaareerik or jaivik ghatakon ko nirupit karne ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 British ecologist Arthur Tansley later refined the term, describing it as "the whole system 


 not only the organism complex, but also the whole complex of all the physical factors that we call the environment"
 tansle paaritantron ko na keval prakritik ikaiyaan ke rup main, balki "maansik isolats" ke rup main bhi maanate the
 Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term "ecotope"
 paristhitiki tantra avadharana kaa mukhya vichaar yah he ki jivit jeev apane sthaneey parivesh main har duusare tatv ko prabhavit karaten hai
 Eugene Odum, a founder of Ecology said: "an entity that includes all organisms that affect the physical environment is that a flow of energy within the system is a clearly defined nutritional structure, biotic variation and material cycle an ecosystem
 " maanav paristhitiki tantra avadharana phir maanav / prakruti dvibhajan ke vyakhya par aadhaarit he or is aadhaar par he ki sabhi prajatiyaan ek duusare ke saath or unke biotope ke abiotic angeebhoot ke saath paristhitikta se ekikrut hai
 The biome is similar to an ecosystem in which a seasonally and geographically defined ecology refers to areas of similar climatic conditions, such as plants, animal communities, and soil organisms, often referred to as ecosystems

 The structure and meteorological elements of the respective vegetation, he said, are each modifiable determinants complemented by ecological data that partially separate distinct species
 yah na keval vanaspati prajatiyon ke liye sach he, balki pashuon kii prajatiyon, kavak or jeevanu ke liye bhi sach he
 The amount of detection of the ecosystem is subject to the physiognomic modifier that can be identified in an image and / or region

 This is not a universal case and there is species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services at a sustainable level: moist tropical forests and extremely vulnerable to change, much less the production of goods and services There is no direct connection between proven, while many temperate forests within a lifetime or a forest fire to their previous state of immediate development Grow back after the tie

 Ecosystems are predominantly stochastic, these events provoke reactions on non-living materials and conditions are reactions events driven by the ingredients surrounding them
 is prakaar, is maahaul main tatwon se uttejnaa karne ke liye jeev ke vyaktigat pratikriyaaon kaa yoga se ek paristhitiki tantra parinaam he
 The presence or absence of population depends only on reproduction and proliferation success and the population level fluctuates in response to stochastic events
 As the number of species in an ecosystem increases, the number of stimuli is also high

 While other local, sub-populations go continuously, later to be replaced through the spread of other sub-populations, the population will move in extinction because some species will disappear, given the great diversity among organisms on Earth
 Most ecosystems are only very Gradually, changed
 Stochastists kuch aantarik viniman tantra prakruti main jo ghatit pahchaan he
 Feedback and feedback mechanisms at the level of this species, most notably regulate the level of the population through regional behavior

 In the two thousand years from the Vedic period to the reign of the Bundelas, many castes and dynasties have ruled this region and have influenced the original rites of these castes with their socio-cultural consciousness
