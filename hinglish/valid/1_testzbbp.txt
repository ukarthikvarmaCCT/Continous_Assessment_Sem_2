 It is the process by which the absorption and emission of infrared radiation into the atmosphere by hot gases is reduced to another planet's surface in the atmosphere
 greenhouse prabhaav ke rup main astitv is prakaar vivaadit nahin he
 Naturally possessing greenhouse gases means a heat effect of about 33 ° C, which will not be habitable on Earth

 Human activity has increased since the Industrial Revolution, which has led to a significant increase in the amount of greenhouse gases, which has also led to greatly increased diffuse bound CO 2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFC and s nitrous
 Methane is more effective than greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, but its concentration is so low that its radiative strength is only one f, compared to carbon dioxide
 Some other gases that are naturally occurring contribute to the greenhouse effect

 There is a possibility of higher CO2 levels in the future as there is a lot of change in fossil fuels and land use
 The rate of increase will depend on uncertain economic, social, technological and natural phenomena but perhaps the availability of fossil fuels will ultimately prove to be the deciding factor
 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios of the World tells of several future CO2 scenarios that last from the end of 2100 to 541 to 970 P

 As the atmosphere gets warmer, the advisory response process is related to the change in the lapse rate
 kshobhamandal unchai main badhotari hone ke saath-saath vayumandal kaa taapmaana ghatata jaataa he
 The emission of infrared radiation depends on the fourth power of temperature, longer radiation is emitted from the top layer of the atmosphere and less than the lower layer
 zyaadaatar vikiran jo upari vaataavaran se utsarjit hoti he khala main chali jaati he, jabaki nichle vaataavaran se utsarjit hone vaali vikiran dobaaraa vatavarav dwaara sokh lee jaati he
 Thus, the greenhouse effect depends on the speed at which the temperature in the atmosphere decreases with elevation, if the temperature rate is low then the greenhouse effect will be higher and if the rate of temperature fall is low then the greenhouse effect will be less

 The land in the northern hemisphere is more jiada, so it heats up faster than the southern hemisphere
 Seasonal ice and sea in the northern hemisphere There are extensive areas of ice that depend on ice-albedo feedback in the northern hemisphere, more than in the southern hemisphere
 Green house gases are emitted, but it is not responsible for the difference in heat as the major greenhouse gases stay for a long time and mix well in both hemispheres

 These models are based on the physical principles of fluid dynamics, radiative transfer and other processes, simplification has been done on cut wakes because computers have their own limitations and the hydrological system is very complex
 Surrey modern climate models are an abstract model in itself
 And this is different with the model of the sea and the model of ice on land and sea
 In some models chemical and biological Treatments of processes are also involved
 This model finds that if the effect of greenhouse gases is added, a warmer climate is attained
 Nevertheless, even when this assumption is used, climate sensitivity still has a large role

 Only a single raid into Burma was launched by six Ghadarites, Another plan that was explored was to raid the penal colony in the Andaman islands with a German volunteer force raised from East Indies and release the political prisoners to raise an expeditionary Indian force that would threaten the Indian coast
 The plan was proposed by Vincent Kraft a German planter in Batavia who had been wounded fighting in France
 It was approved by the foreign office on 14 May, 1915, after consultation with the Indian committee, and raid was planned for Christmas Day 1915 by a force of nearly one hundred Germans led by a former naval officer von Müller was raised
 Knipping made plans for shipping arms to the Andaman islands
 However, Vincent Kraft was a double agent, and leaked details of Knippings plans to British intelligence
 His own bogus plans for the raid were in the meantime revealed to Beckett by "oren", but given the successive failures of the indo-german plans, the plans for the operations were abandoned on the recommendations of both the Berlin Committee and Knipping
 The Berlin Committee, through Ottoman Turkey, also established contact with Mahmud al Hasan of Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal
 This movement, led by the Deobandi Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi and Mahmud al Hasan, proposed a pan-islamic insurrection in the tribal belt of India with support from the Aghan Amir, the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Germany
 Ubaidullah proceeded to Kabul to establish contact with the Amir of Afghanistan while Mahmud al Hasan proceeded to Hijaz to establish contact with the Turkish Governor, Galib Pasha
 At Kabul, Ubaid Ullah decided that the pan-islamic cause would be best served by focussing on the Indian Freedom Movement
 Ubaidullah proposed that the Afghan Amir declare war against Britain
 Members of the Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal are known to have been active amongst Muslim troops along with Ghadarite agents in South Asia
 Attempts made by the Deobandis of Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal, to organise incursions from the western border of India from Persia, through Baluchistan, to Punjab
 Indian prisoners of war from France, Turkey, Germany, and Mesopotamia—especially Basra, Bushehr, and Kut al Amara—were recruited, raising the Indian Volunteer Corps that fought with Turkish forces in a number of fronts
 The Indians were led by Amba Prasad Sufi, who during the war was joined by Kedar Nath Sondhi, Rishikesh Letha and Amin Chaudhry
 These Indian troops were involved in the capture of the frontier city of Karman and the detention of the British consul there, and also successfully harassed Percy Sykes' Persian campaign against the Baluchi and Persian tribal chiefs who were aided by the Germans
 The Aga Khan's brother was killed while fighting the rebels
 The rebels successfully harassed British Forces in Sistan in Afghanistan, confining British forces to Karamshir in Baluchistan, and later moving towards Karachi
 Some reports indicate they took control of the coastal towns of Gawador and Dawar
 The Baluchi chief of Bampur, having declared his independence from British rule, also joined the Ghadarites
 It was not before the war in Europe turned for the worse for Turkey and Baghdad was captured by the British forces that the Ghadarite forces, their supply lines starved, were finally dislodged
 They retreated to regroup at Shiraz, where they were finally defeated after a bitter fight during the siege of Shiraz
 Amba Prasad Sufi was killed in this battle
 The Ghadarites carried on guerrilla warfare along with Iranian partisans until 1919
 Meanwhile, the Germans sent a diplomatic mission to attempt to rally the Afghan Amir to the Central war effort
 The mission was headed by Oskar von Niedermayer and included Werner Otto von Hentig, the German diplomatic representative to Kabul, as well as Barkatullah and other prominent nationalists from the Berlin Committee
 Officially headed by Raja Mahendra Pratap, the mission also had representatives the Ottoman Empire, including Kasim Bey
 The mission established contacts with the tribes of the indo-iranian border and encouraged them to strike against British interests
 This mission was met by Ubaidullah Sindhi's group at Kabul in December 1915
 Along with bringing members of the Indian movement right to India's border, it also brought messages from the Kaiser, Enver Pasha and the displaced Khedive of Egypt, Abbas Hilmi, expressing support for Pratap's mission and inviting the Amir to move against India
 The immediate aim was to rally the Amir against British India and to obtain from the Afghan government a right of free passage
 Although the Amir refused to commit to or against the German proposals at the time, it found support among the Amir's immediate and close political and religious advisory group, including his brother Nasrullah Khan, his sons Inayatullah Khan and Amanullah Khan, as well as religious leaders and tribesmen
 It also found support in one of Afghanistan's most influential newspapers, the Siraj al-akhbar, whose editor Mahmud Tarzi took Barkatullah as an officiating editor in early 1916
 Tarzi published a series of inflammatory articles by Raja Mahendra Pratap, as well as increasingly anti- British and pro-central articles and propaganda
 By May 1916, the tone in the paper was considered serious enough for the Raj to intercept the copies to India
 By the end of 1916, hopes of the Amir's support were nearly non-existent
 Nonetheless, the Provisional Government of India was formed in Kabul December 1916 to emphasise to the Amir the seriousness of intent and purpose of the Germans and the Indians
 The government had Raja Mahendra Pratap as President, Barkatullah as Prime Minister, Ubaid al Sindhi as the Minister for India, Maulavi Bashir as War Minister, and Champakaran Pillai as Foreign Minister
 The provisional Government found support from Enver Pasha, proclaiming Jihad against Britain
 It also attempted to obtain support from Tsarist Russia, Republican China, and Japan and after the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, Pratap's government corresponded with the nascent Soviet government
 In 1918, Mahendra Pratap met Trotsky in Petrograd before meeting the Kaiser in Berlin, urging both to mobilise against British India
 Under pressure from the British, Afghan cooperation was withdrawn and the mission closed down
 However, the mission, and its offers and liaisons at the time, had profound impact on the political and social situation in the country, starting a process of political change that ended with the assassination of Habibullah in 1919 and the transfer of power to Nasrullah and subsequently Amanullah, precipitating the Third anglo-afghan War that led to Afghan Independence
 By the end of 1917, divisions had begun appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand, and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other
 Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganization, as well as unrealism in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organization
 The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation in the war in 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly
 Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and stance, and the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded
 One of the last events linked to the conspiracy derives from the Irish involvement when, on 28 June 1920, units of the Connaught Rangers mutinied at Jullundur in Punjab
 The anglo-irish War had already begun in Ireland with German support, to which the British government responded with large scale troop deployments
 The most infamous of these were the Black and Tans and the Auxiliary Division
 The news of atrocities by these units, upon reaching India, was instrumental in triggering a mutiny in the 1st Battalion of the Connaught Rangers
 Five men from c Company refused to take orders from their officers, declaring their intent not to serve the King until British forces left Ireland
 The Union Flag at Jullundur was replaced by the flag of the Irish Republic
 This mutiny was suppressed within three days and the mutineers imprisoned at Dagshai
 However, rumours of execution of the prisoners led to the spread of unrests
 atsolan, Private James Daly led about 70 Rangers in mutiny and tried to storm the armoury, which the loyal guard successfully defended
 Two mutineers were shot dead while others were taken prisoner
 In all, about 400 men joined the mutiny, of whom eighty-eight were court martialled
 Fourteen were sentenced to death and the rest given up to 15 years in gaol
 a few were acquitted
 Thirteen of the men sentenced to die had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment
 21-year-old Daly was shot by a firing squad in Dagshai prison on November 2, 1920; he was the last member of British Forces to be executed for mutiny
 Daly and John Miranda were buried at the Dagshai graveyard
 Outlines and nascent ideas of the conspiracy began to be noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911
 Incidents like the delhi-lahore Conspiracy and the Komagata Maru incident had already alerted the CID of the existence of a large-scale network and plans for pan-indian militant unrest
 Measures were taken which focussed on Bengal — the seat of the most intense revolutionary terrorism at the time — and on Punjab, which was uncovered as a strong and militant base in the wake of Komagata Maru
 Har Dayal's extant group was found to have strong links with Rash Behari Bose, and were "cleaned up" in the wake of the Delhi bomb case
 At the outbreak of the war, Punjab CID sent teams to Hong Kong to intercept and infiltrate the returning Ghadarites, who often made little efforts to hide their plans and objectives
 These teams were successful in uncovering details of the full scale of the conspiracy, as well as discovering Har Dayal's whereabouts
 Immigrants returning to India were double checked against a list of revolutionaries
 In Punjab, the CID, although aware of possible plans for unrest, was not successful in infiltrating the conspiracy for the mutiny until February 1915
 a dedicated force was formed, headed by the Chief of Punjab CID, and including amongst its members Liaqat Hayat Khan 
 In February that year, the CID was successful in recruiting the services of one Kirpal Singh to infiltrate the plan
 Singh, who had a Ghadarite cousin serving in the 23rd Cavalry, was able to infiltrate the leadership, being assigned to work in his cousin's regiment
 Singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy, but was able to pass on the information regarding the date and scale of the uprising to British Indian intelligence
 As the date for the mutiny approached, a desperate Rash Behari Bose brought forward the D-day to the evening of 19 February, which was discovered by Kirpal Singh on the very day
 No attempts were made by the Ghadarites to restrain him, and he rushed to inform Liaqat Khan of the change of plans
 Ordered back to his station to signal when the revolutionaries had assembled, Singh was detained by the would-be mutineers, but managed to make good his escape under the cover of answering the call of nature
 The role of German or baltic-german double-agents, especially the agent named Oren, was also important in infiltrating and preempting the plans for Autumn rebellions in Bengal in 1915 as well as scuttling Bagha Jatin's plans in winter that year
 Another source was the German double agent Vincent Kraft, a planter from Batavia, who passed information about arms shipments from Shanghai to British agents after being captured
 Kraft later fled through Mexico to Japan where he was last known to be at the end of the war
 Later efforts by Mahendra Pratap's Provisional Government in Kabul were also compromised by Herambalal Gupta after he defected in 1918 and passed on information to Indian intelligence
 By the time the war broke out the Indian Political Intelligence Office, headed by John Wallinger, had expanded into Europe
 In scale this office was larger than those operated by the British War Office, approaching the European intelligence network of the Secret Service Bureau
 This network already had agents in Switzerland against possible German intrigues
 After the outbreak of the war Wallinger, under the cover of an officer of the British General Head Quarters, proceeded to France where he operated out of Paris, working with the French Political Police, the Sûreté
 Among Wallinger's recruits in the network was Somerset Maugham, who was recruited in 1915 and used his cover as author to visit Geneva while avoiding Swiss interference
 Among other enterprises, the European intelligence network attempted to eliminate some of the Indian leaders in Europe
 a British agent called Donald Gullick was dispatched to assassinate Virendranath Chattopadhaya while the latter was on his way to Geneva to meet Mahendra Pratap to offer Kaiser Wilhelm ii's invitation
 It is said that Somerset Maugham based a number of his stories on his first-hand experiences, modeling the character of John Ashenden after himself and Chandra Lal after Virendranath
 The short story of Giulia Lazzari is a blend of Gullick's attempts to assassinate Virendranath and Mata Hari's story
 Winston Churchill advised advised Maugham to burn 14 other stories

 The Czech revolutionary network in Europe also had a role in the uncovering of Bagha Jatin's plans
 The network was in touch with the members in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots
 The American network, headed by E
V
 Voska, was a counter-espionage network of nearly 80 members who, as Habsburg subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats
 Voska had began working with Guy Gaunt, who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, passed on the information to Gaunt and to Tomáš Masaryk who further passed on the information the American authorities
 In the Middle East, British counter-intelligence was directed at increasing the loyalty of the Indian sepoy in the face of Turkish propaganda and the concept of the Caliph's Jihad, while a particularly significant effort was directed at intercepting the Kabul Mission
 In the United States, the conspiracy was successfully infiltrated by British intelligence through both Irish as well as Indian channels
 The activities of Ghadar on the Pacific coast were noted by W
 C
 Hopkinson, who had grown up in India and spoke fluent Hindi
 Initially W
C
H
 had been despatched from Calcutta to keep the Indian Police informed about the doings of Taraknath das
the Home department of the British Indian government had begun the task of actively tracking Indian seditionists on the East Coast as early as 1910
 Francis Cunliffe Owen, the officer heading the Home Office agency in New York, had become thoroughly acquainted with George Freeman alias Fitzgerald and Myron Phelps, the famous New York advocate, as members of the clan-na-gael
 Owens' efforts were successful in thwarting the SS Moraitis plan
 The Ghadar Party was incidentally established after Irish Republicans, sensing infiltration, encouraged formation of an exclusively Indian society
 Following this, a number of approaches were adopted, including infiltration through a "native" Indian intelligence officer by the name of Bela Singh who successfully set up a network of agents passing on information to British intelligence, as well as the use of the famous American Pinkerton's detective agency
 W
 C
 Hopkinson himself was assassinated in a court in Victoria by a Ghadarite called Mewa Singh in October 1914
an Irish double agent by the name of Charles Lamb is said to have passed on the majority of the information that compromised the Annie Larsen and ultimately helped the construction of the prosecution
 An Indian operative, codenamed "C" and described most likely to have been the adventurous Chandra Kanta Chakravarty, also passed on the details of the conspiracy to British and American intelligence
 The conspiracy led to a number of trials in India, most famous among them being the Lahore Conspiracy trial, which opened in Lahore in April 1915 in the aftermath of the failed February mutiny
 Other trials involved the Benares, Simla, Delhi, and Ferozepur conspiracy cases, and the trials of those arrested at Budge Budge
 At Lahore, a special tribunal was constituted under the Defense of India Act 1915 and a total of 291 conspirators were put on trial
 Of these 42 were awarded the death sentence, 114 transported for life, and 93 awarded varying terms of imprisonment
 a number of these were sent to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman
 Forty two defendants in the trial were acquitted
 The Lahore trial directly linked the plans made in United States and the February mutiny plot
 Following the conclusion of the trial, In the United States, the Hindu German Conspiracy trial commenced in the District Court in San Francisco on November 12 1917 following the uncovering of the Annie Larsen affair
 One hundred and five people participated, including members of the Ghadar Party, the former German consul-general and vice-consul, and other members of staff of the German consulate in San Francisco
 The trial itself lasted from November 20 1917 to April 24 1918
 The last day of the trial was notable for the sensational assassination of the chief accused, Ram Chandra, by a fellow defendant, Ram Singh, in a packed courtroom
 Singh himself was immediately shot dead by a US Marshal
 In May 1917, eight Indian Nationalists of the Ghadar Party were indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to form a military enterprise against Britain
 In later years the proceedings were criticised as being a largely show trial designed to preempt any suggestions that the United States was joining an Imperialist war
 The jury during the trial was carefully selected to exclude any Irish person with republican views or associations
 Strong public support in favour of the Indians, especially the revived Anglo-phobic sentiments following the colonial provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, allowed the Ghadarite movement to revive despite British concerns
 The conspiracy had a significant impact on Britain's policies, both within the empire and in international relations
 The outlines and plans for the nascent ideas of the conspiracy were noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911
 Alarmed at the agile organization, which repeatedly reformed in different parts of the country despite being subdued in others, the chief of Indian Intelligence Sir Charles Cleveland was forced to warn that the idea and attempts at pan-indian revolutions were spreading through India "like some hidden fire"
 a massive, concerted, and coordinated effort was required to subdue the movement
 Attempts were made in 1914 to prevent the naturalisation of Tarak Nath Das as an American citizen, while successful pressure was applied to have Har Dayal interned
 The conspiracy, judged by the British Indian Government's own evaluation at the time, and those of a number of contemporary and modern historians, was an important event in the Indian independence movement and was one of the significant threats faced by the Raj in the second decade of the 20th century
 In the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India, it was a major factor for the passage of the Defense of India Act of 1915
 Among the strongest proponents of the act was Michael o'dwyer, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement
 It was also a factor that guided British political concessions as well as Whitehall's India policy during and after World War I, including the passage of montagu-chelmsford Reforms which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917
 The events of the conspiracy during World War I, the presence of Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan and its possible links to Bolshevik Russia, as well as a still active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal led to the appointment of a sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sydney Rowlatt, an English judge
 It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal
 On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the defense of India act of 1915, was enforced in India 

 The events that followed the passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 were also influenced by the conspiracy
 At the time, British Indian Army troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to an economic depression in India
 The attempts of mutiny in 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention
 News of young Mohajirs who fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate and later fought in the ranks of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War was also beginning to reach India
 The Russian Revolution had also cast its long shadow into India
 It was at this time that Gandhi, until then relatively unknown in the Indian political scene, began emerging as a mass leader
 Ominously, in 1919, the third anglo-afghan war began in the wake of Amir Habibullah's assassination and institution of Amanullah in a system blatantly influenced by the Kabul mission
 In addition, in India, Gandhi's call for protest against the Rowlatt act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests
 The situation especially in Punjab was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph and communication systems
 The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that "practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000
" In Amritsar, over 5,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh
 This situation deteriorated perceptibly over the next few days
 Michael o ' Dwyer is said to have been of the firm belief that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated uprising around May, on the lines of the 1857 revolt, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer
 The Amritsar massacre, as well as responses preceding and succeeding it, contrary to being an isolated incident, was the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy
 James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tensed situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre

 Lastly, British efforts to downplay and disguise the nature and impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderatist movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement
 The conspiracy influenced a number of aspects of Great Britain's international relations, most of all anglo-american relations during the war, as well as, to some extent, anglo-chinese relations
 After the war, it was one of the issues that influenced anglo-japanese relations
 At the start of the war, the American government's refusal to check the Indian seditionist movement was a major concern for the British government
 By 1916, a majority of the resources of the American department of the British Foreign Office were related to the Indian seditionist movement
 Before the outbreak of the war, the political commitments of the Wilson Government,, and the political fallouts of the perception of persecution of oppressed people by Britain prevented the then ambassador cecil-spring Rice from pressing the issue diplomatically
 After Robert Lansing replaced Bryan as Secretary of State in 1916, Secretary of State for India Marquess of Crewe and Foreign Secretary Edward Grey forced spring-rice to raise the issue and the evidences obtained in Lahore Conspiracy trial were presented to the American Government in February
 The first investigations were opened in America at this time with the raid of the Wall Street office of Wolf von Igel, resulting in seizures of papers that were later presented as evidence in the Hindu German conspiracy trial
 However, a perceptibly slow and reluctant American investigation triggered an intense neutrality dispute through 1916, aggravated by belligerent preventive measures of the British far-eastern fleet on the high seas that threatened the sovereignty of American vessels
 Seizure of German and Turkish passengers from the American vessel China by the 'HMS Laurentic at the mouth of the Yangtze River, followed by a number of incidents including the SS Henry S, which were defended by the British government on grounds that the seized ship planned to foment an armed uprising in India, drew strong responses from the US government, prompting the U
 S
 Atlantic Fleet to dispatch Destroyers to the Pacific to protect the sovereignty of American vessels
 Authorities in the Philippines were more cooperative, which assured Britain of knowledge of any plans against Hong Kong
 The strained relations were relaxed in May 1916 when the Britain released the China prisoners and released relaxed its aggressive policy seeking cooperation with the United States
 However, diplomatic exchanges and relations did not improve before November that year
 The conspiracy issue was ultimately addressed by William GE Wiseman, head of British intelligence in the United States, when he passed details of a bomb plot directly to the New York Police bypassing diplomatic channels
 This led to the arrest of Chandra Kanta Chuckrevarty
 As the links between Chuckervarty's papers and the Igel papers became apparent, investigations by federal authorities expanded to cover the entire conspiracy
 Ultimately, the United States agreed to forward evidence so long as Britain did not seek admission of liability for breaches of neutrality
 At a time that diplomatic relations with Germany were deteriorating, the British Foreign Office directed its Embassy to cooperate with the investigations resolving the anglo-american diplomatic disputes just as the United States entered the war
 Through 1915-16, China formed one of the major bases for the conspirators, and significant efforts were made by the British government to coax China into the war to attempt to control the German and Ghadar intrigues
 This would also allow free purchase of arms from China for the Entente powers
 However, Yuan's proposals for bringing China into the war were against Japanese interests and gains from the war
 This along with Japanese support for Sun Yat Sen and rebels in southern China laid the foundations for deterioration of anglo-japanese relations as early as 1916
 After the end of the Great War, Japan increasingly became a haven for radical Indian nationalists in exile, who were protected by patriotic Japanese societies
 Notable among these were Rash Behari Bose, Tarak Nath Das, and a m Sahay
 The protections offered to these nationalists effectively prevented British efforts to repatriate them and became a major policy concern
 The IIC was formally disbanded in November 1918, with most of its members becoming closely associated with Communism and the Soviet Union
 Bhupendranath Dutta and Virendranath Chattopadhyay alias Chatto arrived in Moscow in 1920
 Narendranath Bhattacharya, under a new identity of MN Roy, was among the first Indian communists and made a memorable speech in the second congress of the Communist International that rejected Leninist views and foreshadowed Maoist peasant movements
 Chatto himself was in Berlin until 1932 as the general secretary of the League Against Imperialism and was able to convince Nehru to affiliate the Indian National Congress with the league in 1927
 He later fled Nazi Germany for Soviet Russia but disappeared in 1937 under Stalin's Great Purge 
 The Ghadar Party, suppressed during the war, revived itself in 1920 and openly declared its communist beliefs
 Although sidelined in California, it remained relatively stronger in East Asia, where it allied itself with the Chinese Communist Party
 Although the conspiracy failed during World War i and the movement was suppressed at the time with a number of its key leaders hanged or incarcerated, a number of prominent Ghadarites also managed to flee India to Japan and Thailand
 The concept of a revolutionary movement for independence also found a revival amongst later generation Indian leaders, most notably Subhas Chandra Bose who, towards the mid-1930s, began calling for a more radical approach towards colonial domination
 During World War II, a number of these leaders were instrumental in seeking Axis support to revive such a concept
 Bose himself, from the very beginning of World War II, actively evaluated the concept of revolutionary movement against the Raj, interacting with Japan and subsequent escaping to Germany to raise an Indian armed force, the Indische Legion, to fight in India against Britain
 He would later return to Southeast Asia to take charge of the Indian National Army which was formed following the labor of exiled nationalists, efforts from within Japan to revive a similar concept, and the direction and leadership of people like Mohan Singh, Giani Pritam Singh, and Rash Behari Bose
 The most famous of these saw the formation of the Indian Independence League, the Indian National Army and ultimately the Arzi hukumat-e-azad Hind in Southeast Asia
 The Ghadar Memorial Hall in San Francisco honours members of the party who were hanged following the Lahore conspiracy trial, and the Ghadar Party Memorial Hall in Jalandhar, Punjab commemorates the Ghadarites who were involved in the conspiracy
 a number of those executed during the conspiracy are today honoured in India
 Kartar Singh is honoured with a memorial at his birthplace of the Village of Sarabha
 The Ayurvedic Medicine College in Ludhiana is also named in his honour
 The Indian government has produced stamps honouring a number of those involved in the conspiracy, including Har Dayal, Bhai Paramanand, and Rash Behari Bose
 a number of other revolutionaries are also honoured through India and the Indian American population
a memorial plaque commemorating the Komagata Maru was unveiled by Jawaharlal Nehru at Budge Budge in Calcutta in 1954, while a second plaque was unveiled in 1984 at Gateway Pacific, Vancouver by the Canadian government
 The ship itself is today maintained by the Komagata Maru heritage foundation
 In Singapore, two memorial tablets at the entrance of the Victoria Memorial Hall and four plaques in St Andrew's Cathedral commemorate the British soldiers and civilians killed during the Singapore mutiny
in Ireland, a memorial at the Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin commemorates the dead from the Jalandhar mutiny of the Connaught Rangers
 The conspiracy is known under a number of different names, including the Hindu Conspiracy, the indo-german Conspiracy, the Ghadar conspiracy, or the German plot
 The term hindu-german Conspiracy is closely associated with the uncovering of the Annie Larsen plot in the United States, and the ensuing trial of Indian Nationalists and the staff of the German Consulate of San Francisco for violating American neutrality
 The trial itself was called the hindu-german Conspiracy trial, and the Conspiracy was reported in the media as hindu-german Conspiracy
 However, the Conspiracy involved not only Hindus and Germans, but also substantial numbers of Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs as well, along with strong Irish support that pre-dated German and Turkish involvement
 The term Hindu was commonly used in opprobrium in America to identify Indians regardless of religion
 Likewise, conspiracy was also a negative term
 The term Hindu Conspiracy was used by the government to actively discredit the Indian revolutionaries
 The term Ghadar Conspiracy may also refer more specifically to the mutiny planned for February 1915 in India
 The term German plot may also refer more specifically to the plans for shipping arms to Jatin Mukherjee in Autumn 1915
 The term indo-german conspiracy is also commonly used to refer to later plans in Southeast Asia and to the mission to Kabul which remained the remnant of the conspiracy at the end of the war
 All of these were parts of the larger conspiracy
 Most scholars reviewing the American aspect use the name hindu-german Conspiracy, the hindu-conspiracy or the Ghadar Conspiracy, while most reviewing the conspiracy over its entire span from Southeast Asia through Europe to the United States more often use the term indo-german conspiracy

 jin kaarnon se sharir ke vibhinn angon kii samyavastha, yaa swastheavastha, nasht hokar unamem vikrutiyaan utpann hoti hai, unako hetukikaarak or unke shaastra ko hetuvigyaan kehete hai
 These reasons are many
 inhen nimnlikhit bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he : The pathogen causing these pathologies is called pathogenesis
 rogakaarak hetuon se sharir ke vibhinn angon main jo aswasth avasthaaen yaa sthityantar utpann hote hai, unako vikrutiyaan kehete hai tathaa in vikrutiyon se yukt dhaatu ang yaa aashay ke vivaran ko vikrut sharir tathaa in vikrutiyon ke shaastra ko vikruti vigyaan yaa pathalogy kehete hai
 The main purpose of pathology is to show the working sense of the various pathologies that occur in different organs from different pathogens
 un vikrutiyon ke sthool or sookshm swaroopon kaa vivaran dena or unke aadhaar par vividh vyaadhiyon se utpann honevaale lakshanon kaa spashtikaran dena hi vikrutivigyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy he
 This objective cannot be proved without combining the complete history of dead persons with various diseases, post-mortem examination, of the deformities found within the various organs of their body

 This treatise revolutionized the imagination of the relation between the nature of diseases and which tools should be used for their practice and pathology, which was earlier a small subject under Roganidan, Made a great foundation for diagnosis
 sharir ke angon main honevaali vikrutiyaan avyakt hote hue bhi pratikriya, sujan, jirnoddhar, vruddhi main baadha, apjanan, arbud ityadi kuch ini-gini saamaanya prakaar kii hoti he
 When the nature of these deformations is easily perceptible within the body, then it is called macro deformity and when there is a deformity of the subtle form, when the microscope instrument is needed to see these deformations then it is called micro deformation
 vikrutiyon main sharir ke vibhinn angon kii vaishamyavastha par tathaa unke rachanaatmak or swarupatmak parivartanon par jor diya jaataa he or rogon main unke kaaryaatmak parivartanon par jor diya jaataa he
 In the summary, malformations are related to different organs and the disease is mostly related to symptoms
 sharir main vikrutiyon ke swaroop main rog bahut pehle se rahata he
 Only by being very subtle does the sensory intelligence become less and more intelligent
 jab sharirgat sampurna vikrutiyon kaa tathaa unke hetuon kaa varnan uparyukt sarsaadhaaran prakaaron ke anusaar kiya jaataa he, to usko saamaanya vikrutivigyaan kehete hai or jab sharir ke prayek ang, aashay yaa santhaan kaa varnan usamen honevaali uparyukt prakaar kii vikrutiyon ke saath swatantra rup se kiya jaataa he, tab usko vishesh vikrutivigyaan kehete hai
 The patient's pathology is studied by clinical pathology from various examinations inside the laboratory

 The loss, destruction and damage of various tissues that make up the body is called normal tissue
 kaaran - oothkakshay ke nimna kaaran pramukh hai : In summary, the main cause of adipose tissue is the blockage of arteries, veins and capillaries
 iske kaaran ukt sthaan par paushtik padaarth nahin pahunchataa he
 The following are the types of tissue: yah bhi ootkavishesh par honevaali kriya he
 When a tissue is called degeneration, it must be understood to mean a particular type of change in the tissue, such as saying fat degeneration is the presence of fat in a particular tissue, such is the perception, naming accordingly, such as the heart Deterioration, muscular degeneration, mechanical degeneration etc
 duusare shabd main utakon ke paushtik aahaar kii kami se koshika kii rasinic kriya main jab parivartan aa jaataa he, to use apakarshan kehete hai
 In this, the cell dies completely and a new type of chemical substance is produced from its protoplasm
 yah padaarth koshika kii rachana se pichhali purnataya bhinn hota he or isse koshika kaa kaary bilkul bhinn ho jaataa he
 When a specific substance comes out of the lymph inside the cell, it is called inhalation
 yah ant:spandan mukhyat: vasiy, chooneydaar varna kii tathaa amiloid prakaar ko hota he, jab ki apakarsh vasiy mucaide tathaa coloid hota he
 When there is a type of rot in the tissue due to lack of blood, it is called koth
 yah do prakaar kaa hota he shushk koth tathaa ardra 
 Dry koth - When the blood reaches an organ through an artery of one part, dry koth is produced
 ardra kosh - isamen shiraaon dwaara ang vishesh se rakt kaa hriday kii ore dhoya janaa purnataya ruk jaataa he
 There is a flow of blood at that place, but there is no drain
 uparyukt do prakaar ke koth ke atirikt or prakaar ke bhi koth hote hai, jaise, ant: shaalyik koth, sankrami koth, vaatikoth, madhumeh janit koth, vardhaky koth tathaa renon kaa rog 
 The action of chronic or destroyed tissue or cells is regained as much as possible, with the intention that their regeneration is called reconstruction, or renovation
 yah sharir kii aisi vishisht avasthaa he, jisamen shaareerik utak kii navvruddhi hoti he
 Generally, tumors are of two types: mridu arbud - ye praghatak isiilie kahe jate hai ki inke dwaara jivan ko kisi prakaar kii kshati nahin pahunchati
 Malignant tumors - In those tumors where disruption is excessive, the shape of tissue is not formed
 unki rachana utak se bhinn hoti he tathaa unki vruddhi bahut hi drut veg se hoti he
 They circulate in the body quickly and induce healthy ingredients inside
 is aantarik prasaaran kii kriya ko metastasis kehete hai
 For this reason, they are also very deadly and because of this they are called deadly, wicked, or few tumors
 manushya sharir main jab koi rogotpadak jeevanuon kaa akraman hota he, to sharir ke andar prakruti unka ghortam pratirodh karti he or isi yuddh main sharir ke bali kosh un bahari jeevanuon kaa bal nasht karke sharir ko rog se bachaa lete hai
 This curative power produced from inside the body is called immunity
 pratiraksha do prakaar kii hoti he : Natural immunity - The natural force that is produced inside the body in resistance to a disease is called natural immunity
 arjeet pratiraksha - kisi vyakti main kisi vishesh rog ke pratirodh kii shakti yadi nahin he or peeche se swayan yaa kisi anya upayon dwaara usamen us rog ke pratirodh kii shakti paidaa kar di jaae, to use arjeet pratiraksha kah sakate hai
 For example, some germs that produce cholera, smallpox, pearl, tetanus, etc
 are small that can cause disease once they enter the body, but produce small amounts of immunity against disease
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki ek vish adhik maatra main hone se sharir main vyaadhi utpann karata he, kintu vahi vish atyalp maatra main rahane se pratiraksha paidaa karata he

 The abstract formulation of group identities is the separation of a specific group or the tangible natural form of its operation
 is prakaar amoort bijganit or isse pare yah vyapak ganitiya mahatva rakhata he
 The ubiquity of groups in many areas within and outside mathematics made them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics
 samooh samarupata kii dharna ke saath ek gahari rishtedaari saajha karte hai
 For example, a symmetry group encodes the symmetry characteristics of a geometric object: groups here are a group of changes that leave the object unchanged and here performing two such changes one after the other is a binary operation
 Huh
 samooh kii avadharana 18veen shatabdi main evaryst geloa ke bahupad samikarnon ke adhyayan se uthi
 The group assumption was generalized and firmly established around 1870, after contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry
 aadhunik samooh siddhant- ek sakriy ganitiya anushaasan - samoohon ke swatantra rup se adhyayan par samarpit he
 Template: Sidebar subsection ek chir-parichit samooh, purnankon z kaa samucchy jisamen sankhyaayein The following properties act as an integer for the group identities given in the definition below

 To properly understand these structures collectively, the following abstract definition is developed
 ek samooh main ek samucchy g or saath main ek dwichar sankriya •, jo ki kisi bhi do avyavon a or b ko jodakar jodakar a • b se darshaye jane vaala ek avyav banaata he, hota he
 In order to be called a group, the given set g and the operation • must meet the following requirements
 in aavashyaktaaon ko samooh ke abhigruhit kaha jaataa he
 So it is called a group and it is denoted by

 buddha darshan or spitiaj se 2555 varsh pehle ek rajkumaar ne kabhi yah sochaa bhi na hoga ki uske dwaara apanaaya hua maarg ek din desh main hi nahin puure brahmand main isaki charchaa hogi
 The young man decided to walk a different path
 uskaa makasad tha sansaarik aadambaron se dur satyah, ahimsa, dayaa or pyaayar ko failaana
 Later on, this became an era, the name of this era is Buddhism
 saadhaaran shabdonr main jo bhi buddha ke teen ratnov ko puure shraddha ke saath tan, man, dhan se anusaran kare, isaki raksha kare or isko aage badaye yahi buddhizam he
 India has been the main center of Buddhism
 yaheen se buddhizam kii shuruuaat hui, yahi vah pavitra bhoomi he jahaan raja shuddhodhan or rani mahamaya ke ghar rajkumaar siddharth kaa janmam hua or buddhizam kii shuruuaat hui
 Prince Siddhartha, who later came to be called Buddha, preached the Buddhist religion, whose main goals were love, non-violence, sacrifice and arhat
 buddhizam main ek chiz dhyaan dene yogya he ki isamen tathagat buddha ne har ek vyakti ko buddha mat main parivartan karne kaa na koi upadesh diya na hi apni ichha prakat kii yaa cheshtha kii
 Gave the path of all beings, except at their own intelligence and will
 yahi buddha kii karunamayi deshna thi
 Buddhism also played an important role in the spread of education
 aaj kaa vishvavidhyalay swaroop buddhizam se hi liya gaya he
 Thousands of years ago, there were Mahaviharas like Nalanda, Odantapuri, Taxila, Vikramashila in India where disciples came to study not only from the country but also from abroad and they were selected after a rigorous examination
 stri shiksha kii shuruuaat bhi buddha ke kaal main hi hui or logon ke ghor virodh ke baad bhi prajapati gautami ko pravaja dekar or unhen sangh main shaamil kar sampoorn striyon ke liye shiksha kii nai raah dikhaai
 The Buddha denied animal sacrifice and idolatry and taught to walk on the road
 buddha dharm ke teen aadhaar granth hai lri sutara pitak, vinay pitak evam abhidhamm pitak
 Changes take place over time in the whole world and the same is seen in Buddhism
 buddhizam vahi he jo samay ke saath apane ko dhalta he or aadhuniktaa or parampara main saamanjasy banaae rakhata he
 There were four seminars of Buddhism, the fourth seminar was held in 72 AD under the presidency of Vasumitra in Kashmir during the reign of King Kanishka
 isamen buddha dharm ko do sampradaayon main baanta gaya, ek hinayan tathaa doosraa mahayan
 Hinayana is spread over Magadha and Sri Lanka
 isamen vyaktigat mukti kii baat kii gai he
 The Mahayana branch is spread over China, Japan, Korea, Afghanistan, Turkey, etc
 It has not limited itself to teachings in terms of the welfare of the whole universe, this Mahayana was also propagated in various areas of Tibet and Himalayas
 main khud spiti nivasee hone ke naate apana karttavya samajhataa hoon ki vahaan par vartmaan paristhiti main buddhizam ke bare main apane vichaar aaj ke sandarbh main aapke samaksh rakhun
 Especially about a place called Himachal's stronghold in Himachal
 yah baat sach he ki spitivasee buddhamayi hai or vahaan ke gompa, mandag, chhoraten is baat ke pratyaksh pramaan hai or yah bhi sach he ki aasthaa ke maamle main spitivasee bahut aage hai, lekin kahin na kahin mujhe isamen risaav dikh rahaa he
 If it is not paid in time, it can make the situation more serious in the coming time
 sadiyon se chali aa rahi samrudh parampara jiske antargat yahaan ke nivasee apane purvajon se praapt paramparaagat gyaan ko aane vaali pidiyon tak le jane kaa kaary karte the, yah parampara vartmaan main kaaphi khandit ho chuki he
 Due to which the present young generation is getting increasingly distant from their rich, religious, cultural and social traditions
 aane vaale samay main durbhagyavash kabhi aisi sthiti se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, jab yahaan kii nai peedi ko apana ateet keval lok gaathaon main hi sunne ko mili
 Thus the place which was once known for a thriving religious civilization in the Himalayan regions, due to the ideological apathy of its own people, the Dehridheere is able to tarnish its identity
 duusari baat main rakhana chaahoonga ki aajkal log vaishvikaran kii taraf zyada dhyaan de rahe hai
 It is also true and important that modernism has to be carried along, but we are going to forget our culture and past unknowingly somewhere
 ateet kaa sanvardhan karne se hi vartmaan kaa sudrudh nirmaan hota he visheshkar yuva varg is vaishvikaran par zyada dhyaan de rahe hai jisase ateet ab dhoomil sa hone laga he or isi tarah chalata rahaa to ateet or paramparaayen lagbhag mitalrisi jaaengi
 Before this terrible situation comes, we have to think about its resurrection which can be done in many ways: isse aap soch sakate hai ki maatr paanchavin kaksha padhane se baccha buddhizam rupi is athaah sagar ko kya samaj paaegaa? bilkul nahin! hamaari sarkaar ko chahie ki isaki ore dhyaan de, aaj bharat main hamaari samskruti jivit he to vah rsi buddhizam ke kaaran, bhoti bhashaa ke kaaran, atah unhen kam se kam spiti or himalay kshetron main 10+2 tak bhoti ko ek vaikalpik vishay ke rup main padhaanaa chahie
 It is also an important thing that the administration should run employment oriented programs in Bhoti language as well as other languages so that people can get employment easily and simultaneously understand and promote developmental research work on various esoteric subjects
 isse vartmaan yuva peedi ko is ore aakarshith karne main kaaphi madad mil sakati he
 Friends! It is to be noted that in the present perspective, for the study of Buddhism, not only from India but also from abroad, well-known scholars are coming to these areas to do intensive research and study
 parantu baavjood iske sthaneey str par logon tathaa adhyayankarttaaon kaa in vishyon ke prati udasin ravaiya ascharyajanak hi nahin varan niraashajanak bhi he

 isaki sthiti, sankhya, prakaar or dandyatnaa ke sambandh main vividh kalpanaayen hai
 The Hindu hell is imagined in the south and lower part of Hades, where on the confirmation of Chitragupta, Yamdevata decides to torture any of the 28 narkas according to his guilt to the sinner to his messengers

 Those who believe in the notion of scientific revolution think that the scientific revolution started from the last period of the renaissance of Europe and lasted till the last phase of the 18th century

 kavy ko mukhyat: do virgo main vibhakt kiya gaya he - shravy kavy or drishy kavy
 Audible poetry includes all the genres of literature that are enjoyed by hearing, while the real enjoyment of visual poetry is mainly achieved through the eyes, ie acting is its transcendental religion
 bharatmuni ne drishy kavy ke liye "natya" shabd kaa vyavhaar kiya he
 Acharyas have considered two forms of "natya" - metaphor and epithet
 in donon ke pun: anek upbhed kiye gaye hai
 The metaphor has ten distinctions; Prahasana is one of them - drama, episode, speech, vyayoga, samvakara, dim, ehamoon, num, veithi, farce
 bhartiya kavyashastra main prahasan ke swaroop-vivechan par paryaapt saamagree uplabdh he
 Bharata Muni has made two distinctions of it - pure skit and narrow skit
 roopak kaa vah bhed jisamen taapas, sanyasi, purohit, bhikshu, shrotriy aadi nayakon or neech prakruti ke anya vyaktiyon ke madhya parihaas charchaa hoti he, prahasan kehalaata he
 The sneaky acting of the characters of the inferior category comes under narrow skit
 dhananjay tathaa shaardatnay ne bhi lagbhag isi aadhaar par prahasan ke teen bhej kiye hai - shuddh, vaikrut, sankar
 Here some new authors have presented a new classification of farce by mentioning the differences of character, circumstance, Kathopakthan pradhan and jaadukapradhan pradhan, apart from tradition
 prahasan kii katha praayah kaalpanik hoti he or usamen hasyaras kii pradhanta rahati he
 His varied characters entertain observers with his amazing efforts
 kathavikas main mukh or nirvahan sandhiyon se sahaayta lee jaati he tathaa praveshak, vishkanbhak aadi kaa niyojan nahin kiya jaataa
 Its plot usually ends in one digit, but according to Shingabhupal etc
 Acharyo, it also has two digits exceptionally
 prahasan kaa pratyaksh prayojan manoranjan hi he; kintu apratyakshtah prekshak ko isse upadeshprapti bhi hoti he
 It is known from the study of Sanskrit literature that due to the improved status of the then society and special affection for idealistic plays, the creation of independent skins was very less
 "sagarkaumudi", "sairandhrika", "kalikeli" aadi prahasan hi ullekhneey hai
 Yes, the creation of humor in Sanskrit plays through clowns continued
 sanskrit bhashaa ke naatakkaar vatsaraj dwaara rachit prahasan 'hasyachudamani' iskaa ek udhaaharan he
 In the modern era of Hindi literature, attention has also been paid to the composition of the skins

 pi
 shrivastav pandeya bechan sharma ugr, harishankar sharma, aadi is yug main safal prahasankaar hai
 All these have often taken up the subjects of religious hypocrisy, child and old marriage, drinking, the influence of Western civilization, food, etc
 and have indicated their ill effects directly and indirectly, creating humor and satire through them
 prahasan ke samaan hi paashchaatya kavyashastra main kamedi ke swaroop kii charchaa hui he
 The Greek Acharya Plato has despised the laughable joke described in the comedy because of his idealistic approach
 kintu, arastu ke anusaar kamedi ke mulbhaav kaa vishay koi aisi shaareerik yaa charitrik yaa charitrik vikruti hota he jo kleshprad yaa saarvajanik hota he; at: saadhaaraneekaran kii kshamta ke kaaran kamedi kavyakala kaa maanya rup he
 Philosophers and philosophers have considered opposition, dissonance, ugliness, evil, unexpected description, intelligence, etc
 as essential for comedy
 varnyavishay or prekshkagat prabhaav ke aadhaar par pashchim main kamedi ke anek bhedon kii prakalpana kii gai he jinamein se "fars" kaa rup kuch kuch prahasan ke nikat he
 There is more emphasis on subtle physical distortions than on subtle forms of humor like pure humor, satire, etc

 da offis ek kaalpanik vruttchitr he
 The primary carrier of the show is that a camera crew has decided to film Dunder Mifflin and its staff, possibly twenty-four hours
 camere kii upasthiti ko paatro, visheshtah mike scot, dwaara pasand kiya jaataa he, jo utsaahpurvak filmakan main shaamil hote hai
 Others, for example Jane Levinson, often get annoyed or uncomfortable with its appearance

 sabase ullekhneey rup se aisa gym or palm ke saath, yaa kabhi kabhi, auskar or kevin yaa keli or rayaan, gym or dwite ke saath hota he or ek baar maaikel or tobi ke saath bhi hua he
 Dwight often interrupts Michael's interview as he often stands next to Michael outside the screen when Michael's interview begins
 kuch paatr camere kii upasthiti kaa prayog apane laabh ke liye karte hai
 For example, at the "christmas Party", Phyllis's boyfriend Bob Vans repeatedly introduced himself as "bob Vance, Vans Refrigeration" to gain publicity for his business
 In other examples, the camera appears to have affected the lines of the plot
 "da dandis" main, sharaab ke nashe main dhutt palm koi baat gym se lagbhag sweekaar kar leti he, lekin camere kii upasthiti kaa ahsaas hote hi vah sharma kar dur hat jaati he
 In "e-mail Servilions", Pam asks the camera crew to help find evidence about Dwight and Angela's secret relationship, which is also provided by them later
 "fan ran" main, camere gym or palm ko chumban lete hue pakad lete hai, jiske parinamswaroop unhen camera dal ke samaksh yah sweekaar karnaa padataa he ki ve vastutah dating kar rahe hai
 In the opening episodes, the camera crew appears to be primarily limited to office creations, but as the show expanded and included more information about the characters' personal lives, the cameras gained an often-ubiquitous presence and They even began to infiltrate the image of the artists
 Characters are often chased out of office and sometimes even to their homes
 camere gym ke barbacue or maaikel ke raatri-bhoj main or yahaan tak ki us samay bhi upasthit the, jab gym or palm ek baar dwite ke beet farm main raat-bhar chuttee bitaane gaye- tarksaadhay rup se ye sabhi vyaktigat ghatnaayen thim, jinka kaary se koi sambandh nahin tha
 Often conversations that take place behind closed doors are filmed through a window or door crack
 "da ingeuri" main yah darshaya gaya he ki maaikel ne ek betaar lavelior microphone pahana hua he, jisase yah spasht hota he ki camere aksar band darwaazon ke peeche hone vaali baatcheet ko sun paane main bhi sakasham hote hai
 The cameras caught Jane kissing Michael on "valentines Day", which caused Jane to become more irritated and also revealed the personal relationship of both Dwight and Angela and Jim and Pam, as noted above

 a scene is also shown in which Michael and Holly are shown secretly coming back to the office to have a physical relationship, and although they have already been caught by dodging cameras, they still The two's conversations and mutual interactions can be heard as Michael is wearing a microphone, which he accidentally amplifies while trying to turn off the sound The Purchaser

 According to Sakapuni, Visnu placed his steps in a 3-fold manner, on the earth in the atmosphere and in the sky as the sun
 Visnu is chiefly extolled for his three strides with which he traversed the world
 The Mahabharata speaks of him as the presiding deity of motion
 The Natyashastra of Bharata applies to him the epithet amitagata, one with unrestrained movement and the earth is often described as having been trodden by Visnu in the past
 In the epic-vishnu Purana period a few holy spots were supposed to bear the markings of the feet of Visnu, whose main attribute is his power of striding
 Scholar BM Baru explains Visnupada as an astronomical term, when the sun is on the rising point and setting
 Stories about a hill bearing the footprints of Visnu were current in the days of Yaska
 Visnusmriti mentions Visnupada alongwith Godavari, Gomati, Vipasa etc
 besides Gaya
 An important aspect of Gaya pilgrimage, is visit to Visnupada temple
 This temple existed in 4th century AD, but the temple in its present condition belongs to Gupta period
 However, Buchanan draws our attention to an inscription that says the temple was constructed by King Jayasimha of Kashmir in honor of the footprints of deity Dattatreya
 The epics refer to a Visnupada situated in the north
 Mahabharat a carries as many as six references to it, three of which speak of it as a spot on the top of a northern hill
 Historian Suvira Jaiswal says, “at present we cannot determine its exact location, it appears to have been in the north”
 Popularity of worship of Visnupada in Kashmir is certainly due to sway of Buddhism in the region
 Jaiswal argues, ”the practice of dedicating the footprints of Visnu and of erecting shrines over them became popular certainly due to the Buddhist influence
 It was later adopted by Vaisnavism in which Visnu's foot was already much exalted
 But it was not popular among Vaisnavas, as dearth of available evidence indicates ”
