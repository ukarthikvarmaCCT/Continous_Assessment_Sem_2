 Biogas or biogas is a gas mixture produced by the dissolution of organic material in the absence of oxygen
 yah saura urja or pawan urja kii tarah hi navikarniya urja strot he
 Biogas can be produced from locally available raw materials and waste
 yah paryaavaran-mitra or co2-neutral he
 Biogas can be made from fossil fuels or from dead biomass
 byogas adhikanshat: jeevashm eendhanon se adhik pasand kiya jaataa he
 a small amount of carbon is healthy for the environment, but when excess it becomes irritating
 jeevashm eendhanon main carbon itane samay se maujuud he ki vah ab carbon cycle kaa hissaa hi nahin rah gai
 Carbon levels increase when fossil fuels burn
 byogas haalia mrit organism se banataa he, isliye yah vaataavaran main carbon str ko nahin bigaadti
 Biogas is also better than fossil fuel because it is cheaper and renewable energy
 vikasshil deshon ke liye yah phydemand he kyonki ise chote sanyantron main banaaya ja saktaa he, lekin kuch logon kaa kahana he fasalon se praapt kiye jane vaale eendhan se khaadya padaartho kii kami ho jaaegi or isse van kataav, jal va mitti main pradooshan, yaa tel utpaadak deshon par nakaaratmak prabhaav padegaa
 In a biogas plant, biogas is made using animal waste or energy crops
 energy crops ko bhojan ke bajaay biophules ke liye ugaaya jaataa he
 Biofuel is made from dead organic elements called biomass and can be in liquid, gaseous or solid form
 ek byogas plant main ek digester or gas holder hota he jo eendhan nirmaan karata he
 The digester of the plant is airtight in which waste material is added and gas is stored in the gas holder
 byogas plant kaa nirmaan gas kii jarurat or vyarth padaarth kii uplabdhta par nirbhar karata he
 Also on batch feeding or continuous feeding of the digester
 byogas plant jameen kii sataha yaa uske neeche banaaya jaataa he or donon modelon ke apane phaayde-nuksaan hai
 The plant on the surface is easy to maintain and also benefits from the heat of the sun, but more attention has to be paid to its construction as there is attention to the internal pressure of the digester
 iske vipareet sataha ke neeche sthit plant nirmaan main aasaan lekin rakh-rakhaav main mushkil hota he
 India has the largest number of cattle in the world, so there is a huge potential for the development of biogas
 byogas maweshiyon ke utsarjan padaarthon ko kam taap par digester main chalaakar microb utpann karke praapt kii jaati he
 Bio-gas contains 75 percent methane gas which burns without producing smoke
 lakdi, charcol tathaa koyale ke vipareet yah jalane ke pashchaat raakh jaise koi upshisht bhi nahin chhodti he
 It is being used in rural areas for cooking and arranging light as fuel
 rashtriya byogas vikaas kaarykram ke antargat paariwarik yaa gharelu tathaa saamudayik do prakaar ke sanyantron kii sthapana kii jaati he
 This provides clean and cheap energy supply and cleaning of the rural environment as well as high quality organic manure as the dung and bio-gas used for bio gas are abundant in nitrogen and phosphorus
 saavdhaanee keval yah baratani chahie ki byogas sanyantr kii 15 meter kii paridhi main koi peyajal strot na ho
 In the Terai and plains of India, dung is dried as dung and used as fuel
 isse gobar main maujuud paudhon ke liye poshankari adhikansh tatva nasht ho jate hai
 It also takes about 1-2 hours per day to make upla
 atah khaanaa pakaane hetu gobar ke upalon ke sthaan par gobar se baio gas bana kar baio gas ko eendhan ke rup main prayog karne se poshak tatwon ki haani nahin hoti he kyonki baio gas se praapt baio gas slori main paudhon ke liye upyogi sabhi poshak tatva uplabdh rahete he, saath hi khaanaa banane main dhunaa nahin hota he jisase gruhani ki aankhon par koi pratikul asar bhi nahin padataa he
 Drying the bio gas slurry directly or under shade or by making vermicompost should be used in the fields as compost
 baio gas se aajkal dijal pump set bhi chalaa sakate he jisase dijal evam anya urja ki bachat hoti he
 In the biogas plant, after digestion of cow dung, 25% solids are converted into gas and 75% solids are converted to manure
 2 ghan meter ke gas sanyantr main jisamen kareeb 50 kilo gobar roj yaa 18-25 ton gobar ek varsh main daalaa jaataa he, us gobar se 80% namiyukt kareeb 10 ton byogas slori kaa khaad praapt hota he
 It is a very good manure for farming, it contains nitrogen 1
5 to 2% phosphorus 1
0% and potash 1
0%
 byogas sanyantra se jab slori ke rup main khaad baahar aata he tab jitna nitrogen gobar main hota he utana hi nitrogen slori main bhi hota he, parantu sanyantra main pachan kriya ke dauraan carbon kaa roopaantar gas main hone se carbon kaa pramaan kam hone se carbon nitrogen anupaat kam ho jaataa he va isse nitrogen kaa pramaan badha hua prathit hota he
 20% nitrogen amo in thin slurry produced from biogas plant
 Nickel is in the form of nitrogen, so if it is used immediately by making drains in the field or mixed with irrigation water and left in the field, then its benefit is like chemical fertilizer immediately on the crop and in production 10 to 20 byogas sanyantr main gobar kii pachan kriya ke baad 25% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar gas ke rup main hota he or 75% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar khaad ke rup main hota he
 In a 2 cubic meter gas plant, in which about 50 kg of cow dung or 18-25 tons of dung is added in a year, about 10 tons of biogas slurry containing 80% moisture is obtained from that cow dung
 yah kheti ke liye ati uttam khaad hota he isamen nitrogen 1
5 se 2% phosphorus 1
0% evam potash 1
0% tak hota he
 When the fertilizer comes out in the form of slurry from the biogas plant, the nitrogen is present in the slurry as much nitrogen is also present in the slurry, but during the digestion in the plant, there is evidence of carbon conversion in the gas due to reduced carbon nitrogen
 The ratio decreases and the evidence of nitrogen appears to be increased
 byogas sanyantra se nikali patali slori main 20% nitrogen amo
 nikal nitrogen ke rup main hota he atah yadi iskaa turant upyog khet main naaliyaan banaakar athwa sinchai ke pani main milakar khet main chhod diya jaae to iskaa laabh rasinic khaad kii tarah se fasal par turant hota he or utpaadan main 10 se 20% tak badhat ho sakati he
 After drying the slurry manure, some part of nitrogen flies in the air
 yah khaad acinchit kheti main ek hectares main kareeb 5 ton va sinchai vaali kheti main 10 ton prati hectares ke pramaan main daalaa jaataa he
 Biogas slurry manure contains micronutrients and humus in addition to the main ingredients, which improves soil vessel, increases water holding capacity and increases microorganisms
 is khaad ke upyog se anya jaivik khaad kii tarah 3 varshon tak poshak tatv fasalon ko dhire-dhire uplabdh hote rahete he
 If the dung gas plant is near home and away from the field, then there is a lot of space to store the thin slurry and transfer of thin slurry is also difficult, in such a situation it is necessary to dry the slurry
 iske liye gramopayogi filtreshan tanks kii paddati viksit kii gai he
 In this, two cement tanks of 1
65 m × 0
6 m × 0
5 m are built for a 2 cubic meter plant attached to the exhaust chamber of biogas, on its other side a paved pit is made to collect filtered water
 filtreshan tanks main neeche 15 se
me
 motaai kaa kaadi kachra, sookhaa kachra, haraa kachra, ityadi daalaa jaataa he
 When the slurry of liquid form falls from the exhaust chamber, the water of the slurry is sieved through the waste and collected in the pits below
 is tarah jitna pani byogas sanyantr main gobar kii bharaai ke samay daalaa jaataa he uskaa 2 / 3 hissaa gaddhe main punah ekatra ho jaataa he ise gobar ke saath milakar punah sanyantr main daalane se gas utpaadan bad jaataa he
 Apart from this, all the nutrients are in a soluble state, so spraying on the plants improves the growth of the plants and increases the fruit
 kareeb 15-20 dinon main pehla tanks bhar jaataa he tab is tanks ko dhak kar slori kaa nikaas duusare tanks main khol diya jaataa he, iskaa bhandaaran alag se gaddhe main kiya ja saktaa he athwa isko baiylgaadee main bharkar khet tak pahunchaana aasaan hota he
 With the help of a filtration tank, more biogas slurry can be stored in less space and the water is also saved by getting the filtered water out and reusing it in the plant
 is prakaar byogas sanyantra se byogas dwaara eendhan kii samasya kaa samaadhaan to hota hi he saath main slori ke rup main uttam khaad bhi kheti ke liye praapt hota he
 Therefore, it would be appropriate to call the biogas plant also a biodegrad slurry manure plant

 The socio-political ideals of freedom and equality will prove to be complementary to each other
 nyaay se koi vanchit nahin hoga or maanavtaa ek maatr jati hogi
 The culture of labor will be the best and the level of technology will be the highest
 samyawad siddhanthata araajaktaa kaa poshak hai jahaan rajya kii aavashyaktaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Basically, this idea expresses the advanced stage of socialism
 jahaan samaajwaad main kartavya or adhikaar ke vitaran ko 'harek se apni kshamtanusaar, harek ko karyaanusaar' ke sutara se niyamit kiya jaataa he, vahiin samyawad main 'harek se kshamtanusaar, harek ko aavashyaktaanusaar' siddhant kaa lagu kiya jaataa he
 Communism prohibits personal property
 pratham vishwayuddh, samaajawaadee andolan ke liye ek mahatvapurn ghatana thi
 While on the one hand the socialist movement and their international organization almost disintegrated at the beginning of it, on the other hand, there was a Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the foundation of the first successful socialist state in the world, which had a profound impact on the socialist movements of the world
 
 pratham mahayuddh ke purv samaajawaadee dalon kaa mat tha ki poonjivadi vyavastha hi yudhon ke liye uttaradaayi he or yadi vishwayuddh aarambh hua to prayek samaajawaadee dal kaa kartavya hona chahie ki vah apni poonjeewaadi sarkaar kii yudhniti kaa virodh kare or grihayuddh dwaara samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye prayatnsheel ho
 But as soon as the war started, except for the socialist parties of Russia and Italy, the majority of all the parties supported the policy of their governments
 samaajwaadiyon ke keval ek naganya alpamat ne hi yuddh kaa virodh kiya or aage chalakar inamen se kuch vladimir lenin or uske samyavaadee antarrashtriya sanghathan ke samarthak bane
 But due to the conflicting tactics of the socialist movements of different countries, their unity came to an end
 bolshevik dal rus ke kai samaajawaadee dalon main se ek tha
 It was successful under the special circumstances of 1917
 roosi samaajwaad kii parshwabhoomi anya europea samaajawaadon kii sthiti se bhinn thi
 The Russian Empire was lagging behind the leading countries of Europe in industry trade, so the majority of the working class could not be more influential here
 yahan loktantratmak shashan or vyaktigat swadhinataon kaa bhi abhaav tha
 The Russian intelligentsia and the middle class were keen on them, but due to jargon repression, the constitutional path of their attainment was blocked
 in paristhitiyon se prabhavit vahaan ke pratham samaajawaadee rus ke gramin commune ko apane vichaaron kaa aadhaar maanate the tathaa krantikari maarg dwaara jaarshahi kaa naash loktantrwaad kii safalataa ke liye pratham sopan samajhate the
 Among those thinkers are Hergen, Lavrov, Charnyshevsky and Bakunin
 inase prabhavit hokar anek buddhijivi kranti kii ore agrasar hue
 In this way the foundation of Narodnik mass movement was laid and Narodanya Volya organization was formed
 san 1901 main iskaa naam saamaajik krantikari party rakhaa gaya
 By the time of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, it was the largest socialist party in Russia, but its area of influence was mostly rural people
 iske vam paksh ne bolshevik kranti kaa samarthan kiya
 The second socialist ideology, which included the Bolshevik Party, is also known as the Russian Social People's Labor Party
 iskaa prabhaav mukhyat: naagarik majdoor varg main tha
 Industries in Russia were few, but large in scale and hired more workers than expected
 at: in mazdooron main raajnneetik chetana or sanghathan adhik tha
 In the absence of democracy, it was difficult for the workers to struggle, so the working class came under revolutionary influence and due to the conditions like Germany, most of the labor leaders here were also influenced by Marxist and Germany's Social Democratic Party
 san 1890 ke lagbhag excrod or plekhanov ne petersvarg main pratham majdoor samooh sthapit kiye jo aage chalakar 1898 main roosi saamaajik loktantrvaadi majdoor party ke aadhaar bane
 The leader of the Russian Social Democratic Democratic Labor Party was a staunch Marxist, so he rejected recapitalism and developed Marxism and applied it to Russian conditions
 mazdooron kii rahan sahan ke str main unnati hui thi, is satya ko na maananaa kathin tha, parantu plekhanov ne siddh kiya ki nai mashiinon ke prayog or mazdooree main apekshaya vruddhi na hone ke kaaran poonjeewaadi shoshan kii dar badhati ja rahi he
 Bukharin argued that imperialist countries were able to keep their working class satisfied by exploiting the colonies
 tratski aadi ne kaha ki poonjeewaadi kaa sankat sarvyaapee ho gaya he or is sthiti main yah sambhav he ki kranti pashchim europe ke agrani deshon main na hokar apekshaakrit pichde deshon main, jahaan samrajyavaadee kadi sabase kamjor he, vahaan ho
 Some thinkers first showed Russia the location of the socialist revolution
 tratski or lenin kaa mat tha ki samaajawaadee kranti usee samay safal ho sakati he jab vah kai deshon main ek saath faile, sthaayee kranti ke bina keval ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana kathin he
 Later Lenin and Stalin amended this principle to create Soviet power on the basis of unilateral socialism
 nikolai lenin ne uparyukt vichaaron kaa samanvay karke bolshevik dal kaa sanghathan or oktober kranti kaa netritv kiya
 At the London Conference of 1903, the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party articulated its socialist ideal, but within this class party two ideologies emerged and later they formed two parties
 is conference main utpaadan ke sadhano ke rashtriyakaran, jameendaari unmoolan, upniveshon kaa aatmanirmaan kaa adhikaar, dhyey kii prapti kaa krantikari maarg or kranti ke baad sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee-is niti ko sweekaar kiya gaya, parantu dal ke sanghathan ke sambandh main netaaon main matbhed ho gaya
 The question was whether the membership of the party should be limited only to the workers or every person accepting the ideals should be its officer and should the Central Committee have the right to dissolve the branches of the party and appoint new branches in their place? Lenin was in favor of a well-organized party with military discipline and had a majority in the conference, hence the name of this section was Bolshevik and the second section was called Menshevik
 aage chalakar in dalon ke bich or bhi matbhed upasthit hue
 The Menshevik Party first wanted to end the capitalist democratic revolution of the end of Tsarism and in this revolution, it wanted to cooperate with the left side of the capitalist parties, but after the revolution of 1905, Lenin and his companions came to the conclusion that due to fear of socialist revolution, capitalism Has become reactionary, therefore it is also unable to lead the capitalist democratic revolution
 isliye is kranti kaa netritv bhi keval sarvhaara varg hi kar saktaa he or is kranti ko sarvhaara kranti ke saath milakar jaarshahi ke baad ekadam samaajwaad kii sthapana sambhav he
 Lenin was in favor of dividing feudal land among the peasants to get the support of the peasants in the revolution, the Mensheviks wanted to socialize it immediately
 bolshevik dal ne pratham mahayuddh kaa virodh kiya or samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye grihayuddh kaa naaraa diya
 The war-torn public, and especially the Russian troops, welcomed this policy, but the Mensheviks did not oppose the war and continued the war by joining the government after the February March revolution
 san 1917 kii oktober kranti main lenin ke vichaaron or bolshevik sanghathan kii vijay hui
 After the Paris Commune of 1871, in 1917, the first permanent socialist state - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was established
 is rajya main utpaadan ke sadhano-udyog dhandhe, vyapaar, vinimay, bhoomi aadi-kaa rashtriyakaran kiya gaya or shoshak varg kii aarthik tathaa raajnneetik shakti kaa ant kar diya gaya
 Within the country, initially the representatives of peasants, laborers and soldiers were ruled by mixed Soviets, but according to the constitution of 1936, a bicameral parliament was established
 iske upree sadan kaa chunaav soviet desh ke vibhinn ganraajyon dwaara hota he tathaa nimna sadan ke sadsy kshetreey nirvachan kshetron dwaara chune jate hai
 But Soviet countries are one-party states, the state power is in the hands of communist party
 kisi duusare dal ko raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa adhikaar nahin
 After the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Party named itself the Communist Party and in 1919 published a second Communist Manifesto, on the basis of which a new international movement - Communist International - was established and with its help started the propagation of communism in various countries
 lenin ke vichaaron ko samyawad kii sangya di jaati he, parantu lenin ke baad joseph stallin maotsethung nikita chrishchov tathaa vibhinn deshon ke samyavaadee netaaon ne in vichaaron kii vyakhya or unka vikaas kiya he
 All these ideas fall under the category of communism
 stallin ke vichaaron main uskaa upniveshon ko aatmanirnay kaa adhikaar, niojit arthvyavastha arthath panchavarshiya aadi yojanaayen tathaa samuhik or rajkeey swaamitv main kheti mukhya hai
 The impact of socialism increased in the world between the Second World War and after the success of Soviet forces and other international conditions
 yuddh kaa ant hone tak na keval purvi europe soviet prabhavakshetra ban gaya, varan san 1948 i
 tak inamen se adhikansh deshon main samyavaadee rajya sthapit ho gaye
 In Asia too, communism was successful in a large country like China and under the influence of Soviet and People's Republic of China, the rule of North Asia and North Vietnam came under communist influence
 samyawad kaa asar sabhi deshon main badha
 Countries such as France, Italy and Hindustia have powerful communist parties
 parantu samyawad ke prasar ne us andolan ke saamne kai saidhantik or vyaavhaarik kathinaaiyaan upasthit kii hai- Communist Yugoslavia's ruler Josip Brozovit Tito and his other communist allies were the first to challenge the Soviet leadership
 yugoslavia bahut kuch apane prayatnon se swatantra hua tha at: uske andar swabhimaan kii bhaavana thi
 He was also not surrounded by Soviet influence like other communist countries of East Europe
 yugoslav paksh kaa kahana tha ki soviet sarkaar unki audyogic unnati main baadhak he tathaa unki swatantraaa ko simit karti he
 His stanzas later proved to be true, but at that time Titoism was called the pivot of recidivism, Trotskyism or imperialism
 siddhant ke str par titowad ne rashtriya samyavad, shakti ke vikendrikaran, kisaanon dwaara bhoomi kaa nijee swaamitv, rajya or naukarshahi ke sthaan main udyogon par mazdooron kaa niyantran tathaa samyavaadee dal or desh ke andar apekshaakrit adhik swadhinata par jor diya
 Tito's ideas have had an impact on other communist countries in Eastern Europe
 samyavaadee deshon ke bich samanta kii maang ko sweekaar karke khrushchov ne titowad ko anshat: sweekaar kiya, parantu saath hi usne lenin stallinavaad main bhi kai mahatvapurn sanshodhan kiye hai
 Lenin thought that until the end of imperialism, there would be war in the world, but according to Khrushkov, at this time the powers of progress are so strong that world war can be stopped and peaceful coexistence between capitalist and socialist systems is possible
 vah yah bhi kahata he ki in paristhitiyon main samaajwaad kii sthapana kaa keval krantikari maarg hi nahin he, varan vibhinn deshon main alag alag samyavaadee dalon dwaara vikasvaadi or shantimay tareekon se bhi uski sthapana sambhav he
 In the other countries of the world, the above thought change has had a profound effect on communist ideology
 tito ke vidroh ke baad purv europe ke anya samyavaadee deshon ne bhi soviet prabhaav se swatantra hone kaa praytn kiya he
 The Russian communists reject Khrushchev's amendments and the military conflict between the Soviet and China is not only getting worse
 sansar ke lagbhag sabhi samyavaadee dal soviet or chini vichaardhaaraon ke aadhaar par vibhakt hote ja rahe hai kuch vichaarak rashtriya samyavaadee dalon kii saidhantik or sanghathanaatmak swatantraaa par bhi jor dete hai
 Thus the unity and internationalism of communist ideas and movement is declining
 pratham mahayuddh ke baad samyawad kii hi nahin loktantratmak samaajwaad kii bhi pragati hui he
 In the midst of the two great wars Britain had twice as many working governments
 pratham mahayuddh ke baad germany or austria main samaajawaadee shashan sthapit hue; france or spain aadi deshon main samaajawaadee dalon kii shakti badi
 But soon their response also started
 san 1922 main benito musolini ne italy main phacist shashan sthapit kiya
 Fascism is an enemy of labor and socialist movements and a supporter of war and imperialism
 vah poonjeewaadi vyavastha kaa ant nahin karata
 The basic principles of Nazism are similar to fascism
 is vichaardhaara kaa prachaarak adolf hitler tha
 After the economic crisis of 1929, Natsi rule was established in Germany in 1932 and later the influence of this ideology spread to the countries of Spain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and France
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke bich fasivadi vichaaron kaa hraas tathaa samaajawaadee vichaaron or andolanon kii pragati hui he
 In addition to the communist regimes of Eastern Europe, for some time in Western Europe, several countries formed joint regimes in collaboration with socialist and communist parties
 europe ke kuch anya deshon jaise tathaa austrailia or newjiland aadi deshon main samay samay par samaajawaadee sarkarein banati rahi hai
 In this period, countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America have also established socialist rule

 “khap panchayat” ye naam to ab lagbhag sabhi sun chuke honge ! pichley kuch dinon se ye kaaphi charchaa main he or inke charchaa main hone kaa kaaran he inke jari kiye gaye anokhe farmaan, jinhen logo dwaara tughluqi farmaan ki sangya di gai ! The history of Khap Panchayat is very old and it continues with its existence in this twenty-first century society, traveling from the Mahabharata period to the Ramayana period and the Mughal rule thereafter! kaha jaataa he ki jab “raja daksh ke yajna main bhagwaan shiv ko naa bulaakar unka apmaan kiya gaya tab parvati ji ye apmaan sah naa pai or unhone yajna ke havan kunda ki agni main kud kar apane praan tyaag die the, jab shivaji ko ye pataa laga to bahut krodhit hue or tab unhone virbhadra ko ye ajna di ki wo apni gan sena ke saath ja kar raja daksh kaa yajna nasht karke uskaa sar kaat de” ! khap panchayato ki ye sabase puraani ghatana maani jaati he ! In the Ramayana period, there is mention of these khap panchayats, it is said that the Vanar Sena of Hanuman was actually an all khap panchayat, which included people of different castes and khapos like Bhil, Kol, Vanar, Reach, Jatayu, Raghuvanshi etc
 But because there were more monkeys in it, they were called Vanar Sena! This army was headed by Maharaja Sugriva and his advisor was Veer Jamwant! samay ke chakra ke saath kaal badalte gaye yug badalte gaye lekin ye khap panchayate har yug main dekhne ko milti rahi ! satyuga se lekar mogul shashan or uske baad angrejo ke shashan kaal tak in khap panchayato ke vajood ko koi hilaa naa sakaa ! mogul kaal main samaaj ko ek swasth vaataavaran dene ke liye in panchayato kaa sahaara liya jane laga kyoki us samay har vyakti se raja nijee taur par mil kar samasya hal nahin kar sakate the isliye ye khap panchayate zaruri ho gai ! ye tab ek tarah ki prashasan paddati ke rup main kaam karne lagi or gaanv tathaa praanton ke chote bade faisle yahi panchayate karne lagi iske badale inhen raajaaon se unche ohade tathaa anya bhet milane lagi ! inke dwaara liye gaye har faisle ko inke adheen aane vaale sabhi gaanv tathaa praanton ko maananaa zaruri tha ! But since the independence of India, the powers of these Khap Panchayats have been well received by the politicians of the country
 And then these politicians had understood well that any decision taken by Pancho was like a stone streak for everyone in the village and no one had the courage to erase that line and that is the reason These khap panchayats were used by the politicians to increase their vote bank and from this khap panchayat started taking political form, which the politicians took advantage of! And today we get to see its style as Tughlaqi decrees! aaj ye khap panchayate hindu merij act main sanshodhan kii maang kar rahi he inaki maang he ki sarkaar “ek gotra main hone vaali shaadiyon ko avaidh qaraar de” kyoki inkaa maananaa he ki ek gotra ke sabhi ladke or ladkia aapas main bhai-bahan hote he phir chaahe kitni bhi pidhia kyon naa guzar gai ho ! apni isi soch ke chalate inhone manoj or bubbly hatyakand ke doshiyon ko bachaane ke liye har ghar se das das rupye ikaithe kiye kyoki manoj or bubbly ek hi gotra ke the or isliye inke anusaar unki hatya karne vaale doshi nahin he balki doshi manoj or bubbly the jinhone ek hi gotra main shaadi kii ! lekin agar inaki ek gotra main shaadi naa karne kii maang ko maan liya jaataa he to aaj jitne log iske samarthan main he utane hi shaayad iske virodh main bhi ho kyoki dakshid bharat main naa sirf ek gotra main balki ek bahan apane bete ke liye apane hi bhai kii beti ko dulhan ke rup main bhi sweekaar karti he or vahaan iskaa koi virodh nahin he ! But today, this khap is proving very helpful for the panchayat politicians to raise their votes, as i said earlier that any decision taken by these panchayats is valid for all the villages under them, then the benefit of these politicians Raising because even one decision of these five dares to topple over, not many days when the khappa chief Mahendra Singh Ticket, the 84-ear earrings Scope run peasant movement at that time was shook the whole power and that he originally made due with an installed because it Panchayte today that its hegemony in this era today! Today, these panchayats have forgotten their social responsibility and have become politically colored, and stopping them means losing their power because whatever power steps will be taken against them, they may not be able to rule the country again! to kya aaj kaa samaaj inke in tughluqi farmaanon ko yuhi chupchaap maanata rahe xxrep 4 ? kyoki jab tak ye netaa inhen apana vot bank maanate rahenge tab tak to in panchayato ke faislon main koi parivartan sambhav nazar nahin aata dikh rahaa !

 har khap ke gaanv nishchit hote hai, jaise badvaasani baarah ke 12 gaanv, karaalaa satraa ke 17 gaanv, chouhan khap ke 5 gaanv, tomars khap ke 84 gaanv, dahia chalisa ke 40 gaanv, palam khap ke 365 gaanv, mitarol khap ke 24 gaanv aadi
 On 23 April 1857, there was a military revolt in Meerut Cantonment and on 10 May 1857, the soldiers of the Sarvakhap Panchayat shot down the British
 11 may 1857 ko churaasi khap tomars ke choudhary shahamal gaanv bijrol ke netritv main panchayat sena ke 5000 mall yoddhaon ne dilli par akraman kiya
 Mohar Singh of Shamli put an end to the British occupation of the surrounding areas
 sarvakhap panchayat ne choudhary shahamal or mohar singh kii sahaayta ke liye janata se apil kii
 With this public support, Mohar Singh liberated Shamli, Thana Bhawan, Parasauli from the British
 banat ke jangalon main panchayat sena or hathiyaar band angreji sena ke bich bhayankar yuddh hua jisamen mohar singh vir gati ko praapt hue parantu angrej ek bhi nahin bachaa
 Chauhans, Pawars and Tomars erased the name of Ramala Cantonment
 sarvakhap panchayat ke mall yoddhaon ne antat dilli se angreji raaj khatm kar bahadur shah ko dilli kii gaddi par baitha diya
 The graves of some British soldiers and officers killed on 30 and 31 May 1857 can be seen on the banks of the Hindon River on the Meerut road in Ghaziabad district
 july 1857 main krantikari netaa shahamal ko pakadaney ke liye angreji sena sankalpabaddh hui par lagbhag 7 hajaar sainikon sashastr kisaanon va jameendaaron ne datakar muqabla kiya
 The English officer Dunlop, who was leading the army, narrowly escaped the attack of Shahmal's nephew Bhagat and Bhagat chased him to Baraut
 is samay shahamal ke saath 2000 shaktishaalee kisaan maujuud the
 Shahmal and his followers, who had mastered the special guerrilla warfare system, had a fierce battle with the Khaki Risala in a garden south of Barot
 danlap shahamal ke bhattije bhagata ke haathon se bal-bal bachakar bhaaga
 parantu shahamal jo apane ghode par ek ang rakshak ke saath lard rahaa tha, firangiyon ke bich ghir gaya
 He showed the tricks of his sword that the Firangi were taken aback
 talwaar ke gir jane par shahamal apane bhaale se dushmano par waar karata rahaa
 During this period, his turban opened and got stuck in the horse's feet
 jiskaa phayda uthaakar ek firangi savaar ne use ghode se gira diya
 The British officer Parkar, who knew Shahmal, got Shahmal's body torn and cut his head and hung it on a spear
 baad main angrej punah satta par kabiz hue tathaa unhone baari daman chakra chalaaya
 Sarvakhap Panchayat became inactive again
 muslim kaal main sarvakhap panchayat ne anek-utar chadhaav dekhe parantu angrej bade chaalak the unhone sarvakhap panchayat kii jadon par prahaar kiya
 Vishal Haryana was divided into Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh etc
 angrej sarkaar main lard maikale ne sarvakhap panchayat par roak lagaadi thi
 Consequently, the Panchayat could not be held openly until 1947
 san 1924 main baisakhi amavasya ko soram gaanv main sarvakhap kii panchayat hui thi jisamen soram ke choudhary kabool singh ko sarvakhap panchayat kaa sarvasammati se mahaamantri niyukt kiya tha
 He is said to be the 28th General Secretary of this organization
 inke paas samraat harshavardhan se lekar swadhin bharat tak kaa sarvakhap panchayat kaa sampoorn ricard uplabdh he jisaki suraksha karnaa panchayat paharedaaron kii jimmedaari he
 To preserve this record, the Panchayati Army has shed great blood
 aaazaad bharat main 8, 9 march 1950 main gaanv soram main sarvakhap panchayat kaa aayojan pandit jagadev singh siddhanti mukhyadhishtata gurukul maha vidhyalay kirathal kii pradhanta main hua tha
 It was attended by 6 xxrep 4 0 panches
 tatpashchaat purv nyaayadhish shri mahavir singh ko haryana sarvakhap kaa pradhan banaaya gaya
 On 12 June 1983 and 5 March 1988, there were twice the Panchayats of Haryana Sarvakhap headed by Swami Karmapal ji, in which the guidelines were issued to the society considering the upliftment of the Jat caste
 aazaadee ke baad panchayat rajya vyavastha lagu ho gai isse sarvakhap vyavastha kaa mahatva ghat gaya
 Now due to the politics of vote, the castes have formed different panchayats
 jaateey panchayaton, gotreey panchayaton, paalon or khaapon kaa mahatva bad gaya he
 Nowadays people want to resolve the cases in the courts, it is a waste of both time and money and disputes cannot be resolved for an indefinite length of time
 aaj akhil bhartiya jat mahasabha jaaton kii sarvocch sanstha he
 Under this, regional Jat Maha Sabhas are functioning in the states
 khap shabd kaa vishleshan karen to ham dekhte hai ki khap do shabdon se milakar bana he
 These words are 'b' and 'you'
 b means the sky and you mean water, an organization that is paramount like the sky and clean, serene like water and available to all, ie justified
 ab khap ek aisa sanghathan mana jaataa he jisamen kuch gaanv shaamil hon, kai gotra ke log shaamil hon yaa ek hi gotra ke log shaamil hon
 They do not have to be in the same area
 ek khap ke gaanv dur-dur bhi ho sakate hai
 Out of the big khapas, many small khapas have also taken birth
 khap ke gaanv ek khap se duusari khap main jane ko swatantra hote hai
 That is why the appearance of Khap has changed over time
 aaj jaaton kii kareeb 3500 khap astitv main hai
 'khap' panchayats have been in discussion for some time
 charchaa main to ve pehle bhi rahi hai, premi-yugalon ko maut kaa farmaan jari karne ke kaaran, par is baar charchaa kaa mudda zaraa gambheer he
 This time, the way he has raised his Taliban flag against end-of-marriage and the way in which he has been raising his voice from Chautala to Gadkari due to his political politics, the matter has become more serious
 khap panchayatein darasal pracheen samaaj kaa vah ruudhivaadee hissaa he, jo aadhunik samaaj or badalati hui vichaardhaara se saamanjasy nahin baitha paa rahaa he
 The true evidence of this can be seen in the present form of Panchayats, in which the representation of women and youth is negligible
 yadi in panchayaton kii manovriti or inke saamaajik dhaanche kaa adhyayan kiya jaae, to aankane saamne aate hai, ve kaaphi chintajanak hai
 As such, the sex ratio of male to female is the worst in the entire Khap Panchayat area, while the average female feticide in these areas is much higher than the national average
 isse saaf jaahir hota he ki khap panchayaton kaa mul charitra nari virdohi he
 This is the reason that women who are self-sufficient in their studies and marriages of their choice, have always been eyeing them
 khap panchayaton kaa kahana he ki kisi gotra main janme sabhi vyakti ek hi aadi purush kii santaanen hai, isliye hindu dharm main samgotri vivaah ko varjit mana gaya he
 But if we look deeper, this claim of Khap Panchayats has no merit
 iskaa pramaan 1950 main mumbai ucch nyaayalay de chukaa he
 During that time, a two-member bench of Shri Harilal Kania and Shri Gajendragadkar in the High Court had said in their famous judgment that Sagotra Hindu marriage is valid
 apane faisle main jajon ne kaha tha ki puraanon, smritiyon or sutron main gotra sambandhi itane antarvirodh bhare pade hai ki unase koi ek nishchit nishkarsh nikaalnaa asambhav he
 In this regard, a two-member bench of judges had also studied the texts of Manu and Yajnavalkya along with the question scholar PV Kane of Hindu Theology and Maxmuler, the penetrating Indian culture
 isse spasht he ki khap panchayaton kii samaan gotra main vivaah ko avaidh ghoshit karne sambandhi maang main jaraa bhi dam nahin he
 At first the Khap Panchayats have been praising the ancient tradition in support of their demand, but since their promise has weakened, now they have started counting scientific reasons in this regard
 unka kahana he ki ek gotra main vivaah karne se kai tarah kii anuvaanshik bimariyon kii sambhaavna rahati he
 According to genetic science, inbreeding or marrying in a group is more likely to develop harmful genes, which can lead to many types of diseases in the offspring
 lekin agar is mat ko or vyapak rup diya jaae, to ek jati athwa upjati main bhi vivaah karne se aisi sambhaavnaayen bani rahati hai
 The reason for this is that just as the people of a gotra are said to be descendants of a father in Hindu society, similarly people of a caste or sub-caste are also considered to be children of a primitive man
 is hisaab se dekha jaae to antarjaatiy vivaah or antardharmik vivaah zyada uchit hai
 But Khap panchayats are also strongly opposed to inter-caste marriages and inter-religious marriages
 is prakaar yah spasht he ki khap panchayaton kii is daleel main zaraa bhi dam nahin he ki samgotri vivaah par roak lagaai jaae
 Their demand reflects the archaic mindset, which is troubled by feminist upliftment and challenges faced by its unlimited superintendents
 isiilie vah is tarah kii madhyugin maansikta kaa parichay de rahi he
 It is obvious that justifying such mentality cannot be justified from any point of view
 Abhimanyu Singh Tomar yah khap panchayat kii khilaafat karne vaale vah do agle jat he jinhen yah nahin pataa kii unki bahan yaa beti kiske saath bhaagegi | yah nasal kii ladaai he
 Khap System prevailing in Jats only and this is the reason why our “breed” is best in the world
 Why did the British form the Jat Regiment, why did not they form the Chamar and Chuda Regiment, what is the matter when every regiment was dispersed in Kargil, then the Jat Regiment was called
 or jaaton ne kargil par desh kaa jhanda failaayaa tha
 Today, the whole country and the media are protesting against our caste, why? This gotra system is our tradition and has a scientific reason
 hamaari jat nasal aaj bhi duniya kii best Nasal
 The Khap Panchayat first came into existence in the year of Maharaja Harshavardhana in 643 AD
 pracheen kaal main pashchimi uttar pradesh ke mujffar nagar jile kaa vyakti hi is panchayat kaa mahaamantri hua karata tha
 Even during the time of slavery, the largest khap panchayat used to be of Muzaffarnagar
 sarvakhap kaa udai pashchimi uttar pradesh or haryana kii khap panchayaton se milakar hua he
 Khap panchayats have organized many big panchayats in the country and have taken important decisions in the interest of society and the country
 in panchayaton ne dahej lene or dene waalon ko birdari se baahar karne or choti baraat laane jaise farmaan jari kiye tathaa jevar or pardaa pratha ko khatm kiye jane jaise saamaajik hit ke nirnay bhi liye
 Khap panchayats have set an example of patriotism even in times of war and have helped kings and kings during wartime in ancient times
 vaise dekha jaae to desh main parivaar kii ijat ke naam par katl kii puraani parampara rahi he
 Haryana Punjab
 Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh are at the forefront
 anar kiling ke yaadaatar maamalon main ladke
 ladkee kaa ek hi gotra
sagotra
 main vivaah karnaa ek kaaran rahaa
 Inter-caste love marriage was another reason for this crime
 vaigyanik drushti se dekha jaae to ek gotra main vivaah se vikrut santan ke janm lene kii ashanka rahati he lekin isse panchayaton ko yah adhikaar nahin mil jaataa ki vah apane farmaan se premi yugal ko itnaa vivash kar den ki vah aatmahatya ke liye majaboor ho jaae yaa samaaj unhen ijat ke naam par maut ke ghat utaar de
 Being a sensitive social issue, the government has been reluctant to intervene in these matters
 lekin ab khap panchayatein bhi is sandarbh main kanoon kii jarurat mahasoos kar rahi hai
 That is why, by pressuring the political parties, they are requesting the government to bring changes in the law in this context
 haalanki kanoon ke saath jarurat is baat kii bhi he ki samaaj apni maansikta main badlaav laae or anar kiling ke liye jimmedaar kaarnon main ek bhrun hatya jaise aparaadhon par roak lagaayi jaae
 jinaki vajah se in kshetron main ling anupaat kam hota ja rahaa he
 There are 22 villages in Sarva Pal Khap
 yah faridabad, ballabhagarh se lekar mathura jile ke chaataa, kosi tak failaa ek vishaal sanghathan he
 It has about 1000 villages
 is khap main kosi kii dinde paal, bathain kii gathuna paal, kaamar kii beniwal paal, hodal kii sourot paal, datir allika kii munder paal, janauli kii tevatiya paal, paigaanv kii ravat paal aadi sammilit hai
 This pal is at the forefront of dowry prevention
 khap yaa sarvakhap ek saamaajik prashasan kii paddati he jo bharat ke uttar pashchimi pradeshon yatha rajasthan, haryana, punjab evam uttar pradesh main ati pracheen kaal se prachlit he
 Accordingly, other popular institutions are Pal, Gana, Gana Sangh, Sabha, Samiti, Janpad or Republic
 samaaj main saamaajik vyavasthaaon ko banaaye rakhane ke liye manmarjee se kaam karne waalon athwa asaamaajik kaary karne waalon ko niyantrit kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, yadi aisa na kiya jaave to sthapit manyataye, vishwaas, paramparaaye or maryaadaayen khatm ho jaavengi or jangal raaj sthapit ho jaayegaa
 Manu gave a system for control over society
 is vyavastha main parivaar ke mukhiya ko sarvocch nyaayadhish ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 With the help of which there was a panchayat of enlightened persons
 jat samaaj main yah nyaay vyavastha aaj bhi prachlan main he
 Later the Gram Panchayat was born on this basis
 jab anek gaanv ikatthe hokar parsparik len-dein kaa sambandh bana lete hai tathaa ek duusare ke saath sukh-dukh main saath dene lagate hai tab in gaanvon ko milakar ek nayaa samudaay janm letaa he jise jatu bhashaa main gavahand kaha jaataa he
 If any issue is not solved by the village society, then the local Chaudhary or enlightened person collects the witness and the issue is put in front of them
 prachlit bhashaa main ise gavahand panchayat kaha jaataa he
 In the Wakandand Panchayat, after solving the deliberations by asking all the concerned people, the solution of the problem is heard which is accepted by consensus
 jab koi samasya janm leti he to sarv pratham sambandhit parivaar hi sulajhane kaa prayaas karata he
 If the decision of the head of the family is not considered, then this problem is brought to the panchayat of the community and village society
 doshi vyakti dwaara panchayat faisla nahin maane jane par gram panchayat uskaa hukka-pani band karne, gaanv samaaj niklaa karne, len-dein par roak aadi kaa hukum karti he
 If the problem is related to the gotra then there is gotra panchayat through which the convict is surrounded
 saamaajik nyaay vyavastha doshi ko ek nayaa jivan dene kaa prayaas karti he
 On the basis of long experience, our ancestors have given birth to this social justice system which has many levels
 jab gotra or gavahand kii panchayatein bhi kisi samasya kaa nidaan nahin kar paati to ek bade kshetra ke logon ko ikaitha karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he jisamen anek gavahandi kshetra, anek gotreey kshetra or kareeb-kareeb sabhi hindu jatiyon ke sanghathan shaamil hote hai
 This wide area is called Khap
 kahin-kahin ise paal ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Area of witnessand 5-7
 me
 tak athwa pados ke kuch gine chune gaavon tak hi simit hota he
 Whereas the area of pal or Khap is unlimited
 har khap ke gaanv nishchit hote hai, jaise badvaasani baarah ke 12 gaanv, karaalaa satraa ke 17 gaanv, chouhan khap ke 5 gaanv, tomars khap ke 84 gaanv, dahia chalisa ke 40 gaanv, palam khap ke 365 gaanv, mitarol khap ke 24 gaanv aadi
 Analyzing the word Khap, we see that Khap is made up of two words
 ye shabd hai ‘kha’ or ‘aap’
 kha kaa arth he akaash or aap kaa arth he jal arthath aisa sanghathan jo akaash kii tarah sarvopari ho or pani kii tarah svachh, nirmal or sab ke liye uplabdh arthath nyaayakari ho
 Now Khap is considered an organization that includes some villages, people from many gotras or people from the same gotra
 inkaa ek hi kshetra main hona jaruri nahin he
 The villages of a khap can also be far away
 badi khaapon se nikal kar kai choti khaapon ne bhi janm liya he
 The villages of Khap are free to move from one Khap to another Khap
 isi kaaran samay ke saath khap kaa swarup badalata rahaa he
 Today about 3500 khap of Jats are in existence
 sarv paal khap main 22 gaanv hai
 It is a large organization extending from Faridabad, Ballabgarh to Umbrella, Kosi in Mathura district
 isamen kareeb 1000 gaanv hai
 This khape includes Dinde Pal of Kosi, Gathauna Pal of Bathain, Beniwal Pal of Kamar, Saurot Pal of Hodal, Mundar Pal of Dhatir Allika, Teotia Pal of Januli, Rawat Pal of Paigaon etc
 yah paal dahez nivaaran main sabase aage he
 In the Sarvakhapa, all those Khapas exist
 samaaj, desh or jati par mahaan sankat aane par vibhinn khaapon ke buddhijivi log sarvakhap panchayat kaa aavan karte hai
 It is quite difficult to differentiate between the word pal and khap
 saadhaaran shabdon main kaha ja saktaa he ki paal chota sanghathan he jabaki khap main kai choti paalen sammilit ho sakati hai
 If Khap and Pal are considered synonymous, it would be more logical
 ek hi gotra kaa sanghathan paal ho saktaa he jabaki khap main kai gotreey sanghathan or kai jatiyaan shaamil hoti hai
 It is also seen that some gotras and villages join many khap
 jat sanghathan purnatah swatantra astitv vaale hote hai tathaa logon kii ichhanuroop inkaa aakar ghatata-badhata he
 Since these organizations unite people to get justice and fight against injustice, the tribe, village, and pal that have more faith can join
 sadsyta grahan karne par koi roak-tok nahin he
 Apart from the said Khapas and Palas, there are many other Jat organizations which are less publicized
 rajasthan main dagar, godara, saaran, khutel or punia jaaton ke chote-bade kai sanghathan hai
 Nagaur is called the Jat of Rome
 madhya pradesh main gwalior se lekar mandsaur or ratlam tak jaaton ke anek sanghathan vibhinn naamon se astitv main hai
 Elsewhere, organizations such as Khap and Pal are not mixed organizations of villages such as Barwasani Barha, which includes 12 Jat Gotriya villages like Lakra, Chikara etc
 sonipat jile main badvaasani, jaahari, chitaana aadi is baaraha ke pramukh gaanv hai
 Karla Sataraha is also an organization of Lakra Sehrawats
 isamen mundaka, bakkarvaara pramukh hai
 Former Chief Minister of Delhi Sahib Singh Varma was a native of Mundka
 isi prakaar mitarol paal main bhi anek gaanv hai jinamein mitarol aurangabad or chajjunagar iske pramukh gaanv hai
 In which Lakra Gotriya Chauhan Vanshi Jats live
 jaaton ke prasidd udyogpati cheti laal verma isi paal ke gaanv chajjunagar kii dein hai
 The Jats settled in the Gol Kunda area of odisha have their own organizations
 jahaan jaaton kii paal yaa khap nahin hai vahaan jat sabhaayen khadi kar rakhi hai
 Sarvakhap panchayat is the supreme panchayat system of the Jat caste
 isamen sabhi gyaat paal, khap bhaag leti hai
 When the existence of caste, society, nation or caste rites, traditions is endangered or any problem is not resolved by any other organization, then the Sarvakhap Panchayat is organized, whose decisions need to be believed and acted according to the guidelines
 sarvakhap vyavastha utani hi puraani he jitne kii swayan jat jati
 It has changed from time to time, the working style and organizing circumstances have changed, but even the Muslim, British and democratic system could not end this system
 ‘pracheen kaal ke ganraajyon kii sanchaalan vyavastha sarvakhap paddati par aadhaarit thi
 On the call of Shivaji, the Panchayati army had cut off the head of King Daksha
 maharaja shiv kii rajdhani kankhal main thi
 Once Daksha performed a yajna in which all the kings except Shiva were called
 parvati bina bulaaye hi vahaan pahunchi
 vahaan par shiv kaa apmaan kiya gaya
 This insult was not tolerated by Parvati and she jumped into Havanakund and became Sati
 shiv ko jab pataa laga to bahut krodhit hue
 Shiva called Virbhadra and said lead my army and destroy Daksha's yagya
 virbhadra shiv ke ganon ke saath gaye or yajna ko nasht kar daksh kaa sar kaat daalaa
 This is the earliest occurrence of Sarva Khap Panchayat and its ganas

 Shakuni, Karna and Duryodhana, following the decision of the panchayat, announced that there would be no room equal to the needle point
 isi kaa ant hua mahabharat yuddh ke rup main

 The social structure disintegrated

 Anarchy had widespread influence in India during the Mahabharata period

 The imperialist rulers in northern India had put the subjects in unbearable calamity

 yah sangh vyakti pradhan nahin tha
 By joining it, the former name of a Rajkula, etc
 were all over
 vah keval gyaati ke naam se hi janaa jaataa tha
 The study of ancient texts makes it clear that due to the changing form of situation and language, the word 'known' took the form of the word 'jat'
 thakur deshraj likhte hai ki mahabharat kaal main gana kaa prayog sangh ke rup main kiya gaya he
 At the time of Buddha, there were 116 democracies in India
 ganon ke sambandh main mahabharat ke shanti parv ke adhyay 108 main vistaar se diya gaya he
 In this, Yudhishthira asks Bhishma that in relation to the Ganas, please be pleased to tell me how they are enhanced, how to avoid the enemy's discrimination, how to conquer enemies, how to make friends
 Are, how to hide secret spells

 The study of ancient texts makes it clear that due to the changing form of situation and language, the word 'known' took the form of the word 'jat'

 At the time of Buddha, there were 116 democracies in India

 In this, Yudhishthira asks Bhishma that in relation to the Ganas, please be pleased to tell me how they are enhanced, how to avoid the enemy's discrimination, how to conquer enemies, how to make friends

 The incidents that have been ruined by the law after the Khap Panchayats of Haryana have become disjointed,' Politics' of selfish politicians And the bound hands of unarmed legal soldiers to deepen the thinking of the enlightened society of the 21st century and the world's largest democratic country celebrating the 63rd Independence Day
 Has been subdued

 Looking at the red tape of the Sarvakhap Panchayats and its bloody, rude and illegal 'tughlaqi decrees' and 'fatwas', it cannot be said that we have crossed six decades of independence and we are a 21st century democratic country and well-to-do society Are citizens of sahaj yakeen nahin hota ki ek maasoom va nirdosh vyakti samaaj ke kuch swayambhu thekedaaron kii sankeern, unmaadi va barbar soch kaa shikaar ho jaataa he

 sadiyon se hamaare desh main jati-paati, dharm-sampradaay, chuaachhut, unch-neech, stri-purush aadi sab bhedbhaavon ko mitaane ke liye sadiyon se jaagran abhiyaan chal rahe hai
 We could not get rid of all these social distortions, but fell victim to another problem called 'gotra-dispute'
 sarvakhap panchayaton kii ek spasht maang ubharkar saamne ai he ki ve gaanv evam guhand ke gautra kii ladki ko apni beti maanate hai, isliye use bahu ke rup main kadaapi sweekaar nahin kar sakate
 Some intellectuals are working together to maintain their thousands of years old tradition, customs and rituals and to pursue the path of amending the 'hindu Marriage Act' under constitutional rules to gain legal recognition, Which is welcome
 sanvaidhanik raah par chalate hue apni baat rakhana saraahneey kadam kehalaayegaa or asanvaidhanik rup se apane rob va dhak pradarshit karne ke liye gaiyr-kanoonee rup se basir-pair ke faisle sunaanaa ekadam galat, betuka evam tughluqi farmaan athwa fatwa hi qaraar diya jayega
 Some crazy people play their cheeks by calling the media world as 'novice' and 'stupid', have they ever done self-talk? Do they also have knowledge of the true definition of 'khap' or 'sarvakhap', principles, values and goals? According to the definition of 'sarvakhap', 'such a social organization which is omnipotent like the sky and clean, serene like water and available to all, that is, fair
 ’ kya samaaj ke unmaadi thekedaaron ne kabhi sochaa he ki ve choudhar ke ahankaar evam naak va moochhon ke sawaal ke naam par madandh hokar ‘sarvakhap’ ke mul siddhanton se kitni koson dur nikal gaye hai? sabase bade aashcharya kaa vishay to yah he ki adhiktar jin logon kii apane ghar main koi ahmiyat nahin hai, ve baahar panchayat bane baithe hai
 Although there are a few elderly and learned people in Khap Panchayats who have full respect in society, but nowadays they are not recognizing any importance
 unmaadi evam asaamaajik tatwon ke dabaav main aakar unhen haan main haan milani pad rahi he
 As a result of this, a deep imprint on Khap Panchayats has arisen today
 aaj nishchit rup se panchayaton, gotra panchayaton, khap panchayaton evam sarvakhap panchayaton kii karypranali va kaaryastylee main dinaraat kaa antar aa chukaa he
 Earlier, Panchayats used to work as an addition, today Panchayats are breaking work
 pehle logon ko basaane ke puure prayaas kiye jate the, aaj ujaadne ke kiye jate hai
 Earlier, every kind of life, goods, property, honor, etc
 were protected, but today there is no care whatsoever
 pehle khap panchayatein saamaajik samasyaon evam kuritiyon ke khilaaf aitihaasik nirnay lene baithti thim or apane str par hi har vivaad kaa nishpaksh evam sarvamaanya hal karke kanoon kii madad kiya karti thim
 But today all these khap panchayats have become entangled in the matters related to 'gotra' matters of marriage and weddings and appear to be eager to hear illegal and Tughlaq decrees to defame the law and take it into their own hands
 pehle khap panchayaton main bade bujurg badi shanti, dhairya, sanyam evam sauhaard bhav se nishpaksh nirnay sunaate the, aaj unheen panchayaton main ‘jisaki lathi uski bhens’ kii tarj par faisle hote hai or unmaadi va asaamaajik tatwon ke lath ke jor par panchayat numaayinde basir-pair ke nirnay lete hai
 Today whenever an enlightened person tries to show these so-called social reformer khap panchayats a real mirror or walks a pen to honor the law in a democratic country, the eyebrows of all khap panchayats are raised
 khap-panchayaton ke kathith pratinidhi saream manchon se kanoon kii sikh dene vaale buddhijiviyon, patrakaron evam kalamkaaron ko gaaliyaan dene lagate hai or anargal pralaap karne lagate hai
 It is because of this maliciousness that the fourth pillar of democracy is attacked in some form or the other and its anger is removed
 sarvakhaapon dwaara sajaae gaye aitihaasik manchon par hi buree tarah se saream naitikta, nyaay, siddhanton, mulyon, samskruti evam sanskaron kii buree tarah se dhajjiyaan udati dikhaai detii hai or kanoon va prashasan mook-darshak bana bebasii ke aansu bahaane ke sivaay kuch nahin kar paata he
 The Sarvakhap Panchayat held at Beri last August 9, 2009 can be called as a recent example
 har ati kaa ek ant hota he
 Looking at the differing nature of Sarvakhap panchayats, it seems that perhaps the Khap tradition, which is thousands of years old, has reached its peak
 aaj kii nai peedi apni hi puraani peedi ke khilaaf bagawati tevar apana chuki he
 The modern youth has started taking decisions on their own and leaving open the old deformities and breaking the taboos of the society and started openly challenging the alleged contractors of the society
 aadhunik yuvapidi kii is pahal ke paksh main kanoon evam prabud varg bhi khulkar saamne aa chukaa he
 The statement by the Union Home Minister P
 Chidambaram to stop the killings in the name of 'honor' and punish their culprits under the current law and declare Khap Panchayats illegal by the media, intellectuals and women's organizations
 The demand may have been able to curb the arbitrariness of khap-panchayats and force them to 'self-churn'
 yadi sarvakhap pratinidhi swavivek, ekagrachit, nishpaksh, maanviya, sanvaidhanik evam loktantric hokar ‘aatm-manthan’ karen to unhen swat: hi gyaan ho jayega ki nishchit rup se hamaari saamaajik ekta, sauhaard, bhaichaare evam saanskrithik mulyon kii pratik khap panchayatein apane mulyon ko barkaraar rakh paane main kahin na kahin asafal rahi hai or jiske chalate un par ungliyaan uth rahi hai
 In Khap Panchayats, large numbers of people with frenzied, arrogant, no-brain, low-minded, narrow and violent tendencies got bribed and there was a continuous shortage of elderly and intellectual people
 isi ke chalate khap panchayaton dwaara ek ke baad ek gaiyr-kanoonee, dogale, basir-pair ke khooni, dahshatnuma faisle va fatve sunaae gaye or sarvakhap panchayatein badnaam hokar rah gayi
 Overall, there is a strong need for Khap Panchayats to follow the constitutional path by doing deep self-churning at this time and accepting the demand of time easily and happily
 sarvakhap panchayaton ke liye samyanuroop aitihaasik nirnay lene, apni udaar va saamaajik chhavi ko prakat karne, loktantr evam kanoon main aasthaa jataane, bhavishya main khap-panchayaton ke anargal pralaap, basir-pair ke tughluqi fatvon evam faislon par roak lagane, unmaadi evam asaamaajik tatwon dwaara khap panchayaton kii aad main apane swaarth siddh karne ke liye pukhta paabandi lagane, saamaajik sauhaard ke naveenatam mulya sthapit karne, saamaajik kuritiyon evam roodhiyon ke khilaaf saamaajik abhiyaan chalaane kii ghoshnaa karne evam maanviya mulyon ko sthapit karte hue bhavishya main hone vaale gotra-vivaadon kaa aasaan evam sarvamaanya hal nikaalane evam ‘sammaan’ ke naam par hone vaali hatyaon, aaajeevan gaanv nirvasano evam anya gaiyr-kanoonee gatividhiyon aadi par roak lagane ke shashakt kadam uthaane jaise muddon par ekamat banane ke liye mahatvapurn pahal karne kii tatkaal aavashyaktaa he
 If we are able to take meaningful initiative on these issues and take advantage of them in the social interest, then not only will the existence of thousands of years old Sarvakhap Panchayats be saved, but people's faith will also be restored to Sarvakhap Panchayats
 yadi khap panchayatein aisa karne main safal nahin ho sakin to yah unke liye sabase bade durbhaagya kaa vishay hoga
 Because now that time has come, when the Khap Panchayats also have to change the time in every situation
 yadi se swayan nahin badalin to nishchit taurapar ‘samay’ kaa kalchakra unhen swayan hi badalakar rakh degaa

 Historians write that this was the first time that even after winning, a Muslim ruler returned to Delhi weeping and celebrated mourning in place of Jasn
 It is clear from this war that Sarva Khap Panchayat was still doing its work at that time and it used to be Panchayat in secret places, forests and ravines

 Seeing Baba's army crown, Rana Sanga understood

 To suppress the Hindus, Aurangzeb appointed a staunch Muslim named Abdunavi as the Faujdar of Mathura

 He sent an invitation to the Sarvakhap Panchayat to come to Delhi for reconciliation
 The names of the 21 leaders who were sent to Delhi by Sarvakhap accepting the invitation were- Rao Hariray, Dhoom Singh, Phool Singh, Shisram, Hardeva, Ram Lal, Bali Ram, Mal Chand, Har Pal, Naval Singh, Ganga Ram, Chandu Ram, Har Sahay, Net Ram, Har Dynasty, Mana Sukh, Mool Chand, Har Deva, Ram Narayan, Bhola and Haridwari
 Among them were one Brahman, one Vaishya, one Saini, one Tyagi, one Gurjar, one Khan, one Road, three Rajputs and eleven Jats
 in 21 netaaon ke saamne aurangzeb ne dhokhaa kiya or inke saamne islam yaa maut main se ek chunane kaa hukum diya
 The head of the party, Rao Hariray, argued fiercely with Aurangzeb and said that the Sharvakhap panchayat wants peace, not confrontation
 aurangzeb ne jid nahin chodi to in netaaon ne islam dharm sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya
 As a result, on the day of Kartik Krishna Dashami in 1670 AD, these 21 leaders were hanged together at Chandni Chowk Delhi

 After this, the storm of conversion started

 Formation of igneous rock Melted under the surface of hot and liquid rocky material, ie magma, below the surface as a lava flow or before it can get out in order to rise
 This is due to the solidification of substances

 They are also called 'primary rocks' because they were first formed in the origin of the earth's surface
 aisa isliye bhi kaha jaataa he ki yahi ve pehali chattaane hai jo pighale hue chattani padaarth se banati hanjabaki avsaadee yaa roopantarit chattaane in aagney chattaanon ke tuutane yaa taap or daab ke prabhaav aakaar main badalane se se banati hai
