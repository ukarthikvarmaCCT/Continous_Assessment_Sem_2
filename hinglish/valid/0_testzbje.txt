 irani chitrakala : iran apni nakkashi ke liye sansar main prasiddh hai
 It becomes evident by studying Iranian textiles, Meenakari squares and paintings
 iran main bane kaaleen rangon ke santulan or alankaran ke prayaavartan ke liye prasiddh hai tathaa vahaan kii pracheen kala ke mukhya abhipraay jyamithik or pashurup hai
 The influence of Assuria on Iranian art of the Hakhmani era is obvious, but since the Sasani era Iranian art holds its own
 rangayojna tathaa chitrankan main irani kala kaa santulan arab, mongol or temuri abhiyaanon ke baavjood apana nijasav banaae hue he
 The portions of the books Manikhi painted have survived, showing that the art is directly related to the early art of the Muslim era
 islam ke aadesh se iran main bhi murti kaa nirmaan ruk gaya, par arabon kii vijay se us desh kaa sambandh duusare deshon se badha or kala ke kshetra main bhi anek antarrashtriya prabhaav uski kala par pade
 After the Mongol conquest of Asia, the way to the Far East opened and the influence of Chinese art on Iranian art began to fall in marked ways
 temuri sultaanon main to apane darbar main achche se achche chitrakaaron ko ekatra karne kii hode si rahane lagi
 This foreign power did not affect Iran's life; Yet it is strange that Iranian art flourished under these foreigners, which was halted during the time of Iran's national Shah Safavis
 iskaa yahi kaaran ho saktaa he ki jab tak desh main jivan tha, kala or yuddh saath-saath chale, par shakti ke samaapt hone par ekta ke saath hraas ke lakshan bhi saaf-saaf dikh padane lage
 In the early era Iranian art was related to Manikhi religion but in 290 AD Mani, the founder of that religion, who was also a painter, was killed and his painted books were burnt
 par kala in sab ghatnaon se marati nahin
 In the early period of the Muslim era, the relationship of art to religion broke down but some painters kept doing their art in the shelter of nobles and sultans
 sambhav bhi yahi tha kyonki is yug main chitron kii saamagree, yani chatakdaar rang, sona or kaagaj itane mahange the ki unka upyog keval rajashrith chitrakaar hi kar sakate the
 It was so hard to make the pictures beautifully, that the ordinary people were unable to pay their wages
 irani chitrakala rekhaon kii majbootee or mor murak ke liye prasiddh he, usamen saaya dene kii kriya kaa abhaav he tathaa chehre kii banaavat teen chauthai chashmi main dikhalaai jaati he
 Due to the greater part of the body being covered, there is a lack of effort to show its specialty
 in chitron kii prishthbhumi vaasanti surya kii prabhaa se anupranit rahati he or saire main supushpit vrikshon, pahadiyon or behate hue naalon kaa ankan rahata he
 The real history of Iranian painting begins with the Abbasi era
 is yug kii chitrit pustakon kaa lekhan abbasiyon kii rajdhani baghdad main hua
 There is no doubt that the Iranians had a big hand in the addition of this painting, but the workmanship of the former Christian painters is also evident in it
 aarambh main vaidyak, jyotish or bhautik shaastra ke granthon ko chitrit karne kii aavashyaktaa padi
 The books featured in this category are mostly 12th century
 inamen raashiyon tathaa jalayantron ko chitrit karanevaali pustaken thim jinamein al zazari likhit yantrashastra tathaa diyoskarides mukhya hai
 One notable thing is that the pictures of the flora in the books depicted by Dioscarides are Greek in character, but the marking of human form, the colors and the costumes are reminiscent of Manikhi paintings and Bizantana kuttamit land
 in vaigyanik pustakon ke likhavane or chithran karaane kaa shrey to raiso kaa he par ebn mukapapha ke calola va dimna or haraari ke makaamat ko chitrit karaane kaa shrey dusron ko he
 The first book is a translation of the Sanskrit Panchatantra and the second contains stories of the clever deeds of Abujaid
 in pustakon kii jo bhi hastlikhit pratiyaan batch gai hai unase pataa chalata he ki saadagi hone par bhi unki rekhaon main jaan he
 By the way, their colors are simple
 inke chitron se 12veen sadi ke arab jivan par kaaphi prakaash padataa he
 Some scholars have also suggested that some of these books were probably written in Ghazni during the reign of Mahmud Ghaznavi because Firdausi re-awakened the ancient Vibhuti of Iran by writing the Shahnama
 par yah dharna nirmul he
 The right thing is that 12th century Abbasi art had the same form in Iraq and Iran
 iran ke itihaas kii yah ek ajeeb ghatana he ki mongol abhiyaanon ne uski samskruti or arthvyavastha ko nasht karke bhi kala ko bada protsaahan diya
 Just like the 14th century is the golden age of Iranian poetry, so too of painting
 taimur ke vanshajon ke yug main chitrakala pragati ko praapt hui par safavi yug main uski unnati ruk si gai
 The 14th century Iranian painting has been depicted as Mongol style, as it depicts Mongols' shapes, costumes and living conditions
 par vaastaviktaa yah he ki is naveen style kaa udgam china tha tathaa is style ne irani style ko ek nai disha di
 This style is characterized by novelty in pushparts and tree marking
 prasiddh mantri or itihaaskaar rashiduddin ne tabareez ke baahar ek upnagar banwaaya or vahaan apni pustakon ke chithran ke liye bahut se chitrakaar rakhe
 The paintings of Jamiyutwarikh, made between 1306 and 1312, show that they depict different styles of the Bible, Muhammad's life and Buddhist events
 mongol itihaas sambandhi chitron main chini prabhaav spasht he
 After Rashiduddin's death, depiction of several books of Arab literature, including Damit's Shahnama, probably occurred in 1330 on stylistic grounds
 iske chitron se yah vidit hota he ki is yug main irani style dhire-dhire apana nijasav sthapit karti ja rahi thi
 Timur's bloody invasion of Iran took place between 1381 and 1392
 unke saath hi irani samskruti par china kaa prabhaav badha
 Timur had gathered many artists in Samarkand, so that there was no hindrance in the advancement of art
 temuri yug ke chitra praarambhik chitron se kahin prashast hai
 The practice of showing the ground and the sky, the display of figures and events in different sections and the actual marking of the promenade are the characteristics of this style
 shahnamaa, lailamajanun, kajavaani kii taarikh-e-guzida, iskandarnama ityadi ke chitron se aanrabhik temuri yug ke chitron kii style kaa pataa chalata he
 After Shah Rukh's death, Sultan Hussain Bekra of Haraat is one of the famous masters of art and literature at that time
 vastav main haraati style ke sansthaapak sultan hossain ke mantri ali shor navai the
 Due to the demand for paintings, many painters gathered in Herat, of which Bihzad was the main place
 heraat ke chitrakaaron ne koi nai style na chalaakar prachlit irani style ko khub manja
 There is no consensus among scholars about the art of Bihzad
 jo chitra bihzaad ke maane jate hai ve unki kritiyaan hai athwa nahin, isapar bhi kuch vidvan bahut khoj ke baad is nishkarsh par pahunche hai ki rangayojna nakkashi or saira ke aalekhan main ve bejod the tathaa yuddh chithran unki visheshta thi
 Safawi era can be called the national era of painting of Iran
 safaavi style kaa rukh roodhi kii ore tha
 Even before this era, the Iranian style was quite stilted, so the painters did not consider the need to bring any novelty to it
 ab unka dhyaan sab ore se hatakar aalekhan or vishaysankalan kii ore lag gaya
 The demand for the portrayal of the poetry of Firdausi, Nizami and Saadi was increased
 shah safaavi iran ke hi the, isliye unki kalam main kuch pracheen roodhiyon kii aashaa kii ja sakati he; par vastav main chitrakala main is roodhi ke chihn kam hi milte hai
 In tehmaspinal paintings, the practice of marginalization embellished with animal birds followed
 chitrakaaron kaa dhyaan rajasi drishyon se hatakar kabhi-kabhi dehati duniya par bhi padane laga
 These paintings hold their specialties for the study of contemporary costumes and rituals
 prasiddh chitrakaaron main mir sayed ali, mirak or sultan mohammad, jo pashuon ke chithran main prasiddh the, ke naam liye ja sakate hai
 In the last days of the Shah Tahmasp, Iranian painters gradually began to drift away from the ancient practice of book painting and good painters were engaged in making shaboh and marking of Vanbhojan etc
 chitrakala or lipikla ke sambandhviched se kala ne ek nayaa rup grahan kiya jiske falswaroop irani kapadon main bhi shabiha kii nakal hone lagi
 Later Safawi painting became completely different from the book drafting but at the same time it became conservative
 chitrakaar syahakalam chitra banane lage or saste padane se janata main unki maang kaaphi bad gai
 Acharya of this style is considered Riza Abbasi who was a contemporary of Shah Abbas I
 17veen sadi main irani kala par europea prabhaav bhi padaa par vah prabhaav parisimit hi rahaa
 In embellishments, Iranian scenes and shapes were filled around them by copying parts from European paintings
 shah abbaas dwitiya ke baad irani kala kaa kramash: hraas hone laga tathaa chitrakaar puraani chitrit pustakon kii nakal main athwa syahakalam tasviren banane main apana samay lagane lage
 In the 19th century, European painting, influenced by European painting, remains its own figure
 irani sulekh-kareeb do hajaar varshon se lekhan kala iran kii rashtriya bhaawanaaon or rasanubhuti kaa dyotak rahi he
 Calligraphy became a major part of the art of painting and carving in the Middle Ages
 chitrakala or sulekhankala kaa cholii daaman jaisaa saath ho gaya, yahan tak ki iran ke anek chitrakaaron ne apni kala seekhney ke pehle sulekhankala yani khushqati kaa abhyaas kiya
 The styles of writing changed many times in the ancient history of Iran, but the principle of calligraphy never changed
 hakhmani yug main keelaksharon kii sundarataa rangon ke upyog se badhaai gai tathaa sasaani yug main zaratusht ke vachan jhilliyon par suvarnaksharon main likhe gaye
 The Manikhis wrote their scriptures in a special script with colorful ink on the best paper
 iran main arabon ke aane ke baad arabi lipi kaa prachaar hua or quran ke siddhanton ke anusaar raspradaayak khushqat par vishesh dhyaan diya gaya
 Many great scholars of Arabic expressed their theories on happiness
 19veen sadi ke ant main 24 tarah kii bhinn-bhinn lipiyaan thim
 Of which the Reasi, which had thirteen distinctions, was the chief
 is lipi kaa pravarttak ek irani tha
 Examples of 10th-century Iranian scripts are few, and the majority of the Kufi script is found in those that do meet, yet find their way into the Iranian style
 kufi lipi kii maar murak or utaar chadhaav alankarik drushti se mahatv ke hai or uski vilakshantaa kaa upyog iraniyon ne apane dhang se kiya
 But this does not mean that the simple script, but the beautiful script was not used in the 11th century
 celujak samrajya kii sthapana ke yug main sulipikaron ke saamne lipi likhane ke anek tareeke vartmaan the par un sabakaa yahi uddeshy tha ki lekhon kii saamagree chaahe kuch bhi ho, unki sundarataa aakarshak ho tathaa aksharon kii sajaavat mil julkar nakkashi kaa rup dhaaran kar le
 Kufi was the main place in these scripts, but in the end of 12th century, racial writing was introduced
 is lekhanvidhi kii khaas baat yah thi ki usne kufi lipi ke thospan ko dur karke najuk mor murakon ko sthaan diya
 The objective of the Sules script was to increase ornamentation by increased syllables
 is yug main khushqati kii pratiyogita badi
 The famous 12th century Khushtanvis Nazmuddin Abubakra Muhammad says that he had the practice of writing 70 scripts in a rhetorical manner
 usne khushqati par ek pustak bhi likhi jisamen naskhi, sulls, rika or muhakq lipiyon kii lekhanstyli kaa varnan he
 Sultan Tugril himself received two copies of the Quran with his own hands after learning about happiness
 14veen sadi main khushqati kii or unnati hui tathaa naskhi or kufi kaa upyog masjidon ko sajaane main kiya gaya
 The Iranian Sufis considered the script to be the means of divine knowledge, and being inspired by this purpose, some Sulipikas of that era came out with a plan of their letters that they were formed by reflection of Sufism
 mongol yug main kaashaan khushqat navisi kaa pradhan centre bana rahaa
 With the addition of the Nastaliq script, we can call the Taimuri era the golden age of the Iranian Khushtanwasi
 taimur kaa ek mantri amir badruddin swayan khushqatanvis tha tathaa sultan ke pote ibrahim mirza or visungur is fan main maahir the
 The Nastalik script progressed unintentionally
 usamen ek aisi samskruti ke darshan hote hai jo aaj tak irani lipi main bani he
 In the Taimuri era, two more scripts, namely Deewani and Dashti, were used and Tugra was used for the records of mosques
 kaha jaataa he ki nastalik chalaane kaa shrey tabareez ke mir ali ko he jo taimur kii naukari main the
 His son Abdullah wrote the script and advanced it
 abdulla ke do shagird the-moulana zafar altabarizi or moulana azhar tabarizi 
 Maulana Azhar, who was also a big tourist himself, promoted this script very well
 unke pradhan shishy sultan ali ibnmuhammad al-mashhadi, jo heraat ke sultan husain mirza kii seva main the, apni style ke liye vikhyath the
 Some of the joys of trance-oxiana wanted to give Nastaliq a new direction, but with the efforts of Sultan Ali, nothing happened to him
 1507 main hiraat ke ujabegon ke haath pad jane par sultan ali ne vijetaon kii seva sweekaar kar lee or mir ali al-husaini bukhaara chale gaye jahaan unhone mir ali kii nastalik style kii neenv daali
 In 1420 Mahmud ibn Murtaza al-qatib al-husaini became the famous author of Nastaliq in Shiraz
 ek duusare shiraji yaaqub ibnahasan ne 1454 main hindustan aakar khushqatanvisi par tuhfaat-ul-muhibbeen naamak ek granth likhaa
 In the Safavid era, there was no change in the Iranian Khuktanwasi, but there is no doubt that the Khushnavites had a great influence on the painting and architecture of the Safavid era
 tabareez ke shah mahmud naishapuri shah ismail ke adheen prasiddh khushqatanvis the
 Copies of his handwritten Shahnama and Khamse still exist
 baba shah isohani is yug ke prasiddh sulipic the
 They settled in Hirat from Turkey and settled there in Tabriz
 shah abbaas pratham ke samay ke ucch koti ke sulekhakon main ali riza abbasi kaa apana sthaan tha
 In the middle of the 17th century, Hajji Khalifa highlighted the history and principles of Iranian calligraphy by writing a kashfaz-obsession on Khushatnavi
 isi yug main nastalik lipi ke ek rup shikasta kaa janm hua
 In the 18th-19th century, Iranian painting lost its existence in a circle of conservatism, but the demand for calligraphic art remained
 
 In the 18th century, with the efforts of Shafi'a, Shikasta also began to be counted in the Sulipes
 19veen sadi main bhi mirza ali mohammad-e-bab ne babi sampradaay chalaaya tathaa khatt-e-badi yani "nai lekhanstyli" ko janm diya jiskaa sambandh armini aksharon se he, jise kuch babi hi samaj sakate the
 Later, the Bahá'ís introduced khattay-tanzili, or "audience Script", which did not get much publicity due to being shorthanded
 par bahaai khushqatanvison kaa dhyaan shiqasta nastalik kii ore adhik tha tathaa prasiddh bahaai sulekhak mushki kalam ke khaton kii aaj din bhi maang he
 In Iran, the Khushatnavasi was a symbol of religious feelings in the conscious or unconscious form from the earliest times
 kalantar main lipi ne mantra shakti kaa rup grahan kar liya tathaa uskaa prabhaav irani kala ke sab angon par padane laga
 Not only did the script remain for rhetoric, it also became famous for its pride in its elegance, fluidity and beauty, as a result of which records became a part of all arts
 vaastu ke alankaran main abhilekhon ke utkhanan se unke bade paimaan main hone se adhik sajivta or safai ai jo kaagaj ke parimit paimaane par sambhav nahin thi
 The authors found the use of increasing the ornamentation of the coffee due to the considerable space on the buildings, but due to the writing of timber, the limitations of the use of the building were put in it and because of this the characters were imagined which could fit properly in the planks and mix in the decorations

 These limitations, which have been violated as an exception only, can be understood as follows: bharat ne nayak ke chaar bhed kiye hai : dhiralalit, dhiraprashanth, dhirodatt, dhiroddhat

 Considering husband, vice-chancellor, Vaishik as the main classification, the favorable, south, shash, hateful distinctions have been placed under the husband
 nayak ke uttam, madhyam, adham bhedon ko hindi main keval kuch lekhakon ne hi sweekaar kiya he, jinamein sundar, top or rasline pramukh hai
 Some other distinctions of the hero are as follows: Proached, obeyed, clever, ignorant
 maani ke do bhed hai : rupamani, gunmani
 There are also two distinctions of clever: vow clever, action-clever
 rasline ne inhen ke saath swayandoot nayak kaa bhi kathan kiya he
 Padmakar is also considered heroic after Bhanudutt's imitation of the ignorant
 keshav ne nayak ke prachhnn or prakaash bhed bhi maane hai
 By the opinion of Rasleen, there are three strains of vice and two strains of Vaishik
 hindi ke nayak-nayika-bhed sambandhi sahitya kaa nirmaan adhikanshat: reetikaal main hua he
 This poetry of hero-heroine-distinction is the result of a confluence of two powerful streams
 inamen se pehali dhara he sahityashastra evam nayak-nayika-bhed sambandhi shastreey granthon kii, jiskaa aarambh bharat ke "natshastra" se hota he; tathaa duusari dhara he krishna or gopiyon kii shringaar kridaaon ke varnan kii, jo "harivansh", "padam", "vishnu" "bhagwat" tathaa "brahmavaivatan" puraanon kii upatyakaon main bahati hui or umapatidhar, jayadev, chandidas, vidyapati, mira, narsingh mehta tathaa surdaas aadi anek bhakt kaviyon kii madhur vaani se vilsit hoti hui, nimbark, vallabh tathaa chaitanya jaise mahaan aacharyon ke samarthan se sampusht hui he
 From the point of view of Acharya, the Hindi writers' contribution of this part of poetry is extraordinary
 kavyasaushthav kii drushti se bhi vidwaanon ke matanusaar itane unche str ke sahitya kaa itane bade pariman main nirmaan hindi sahitya ke or kisi kaal main nahin hua
 According to Bharata, the heroine has eight distinctions: vasakaja, virahotkanthita, swadhinapatika, kalahantarita, khandita, vipralbdha, prakshitabhratika, abhinasarika
 ise ham paristhitibhed kahenge
 According to later writers, who have been called "prakriti-bhed", there are three types of heroines: Uttama, Madhyama, Adhama
 "agnipurana" ke lekhak ne nayika ke keval ek vargeekaran kaa ullekh kiya he : swakiya, parvikaya, punarbhu, samanya
 Of these four distinctions, Punarbhu was not subsequently recognized
 rudrat tathaa rudrabhatt ne ek shodash bhed vargeekaran prastut kiya, jise parvarti lekhakon dwaara sarvaadhik pradhanta di gai
 This classification is as follows: bhoj ne nayak kii bhanti nayika ke bhi kuch moulik vargeekaran kiye hai, kintu unhen parvarti lekhakon ne sweekaar nahin kiya
 Apart from the above three classifications, Bhanudutt has mentioned a new classification, which was later accepted by most Hindi writers
 vah he, : nayika : anyasambhogadu:khitaa, vakroktigarvita, maanavati
 Quibble: romanticism, aestheticism
 iske atirikt bhanudutt ne shodash bhed vargeekaran main mugdha evam oodhaa ke kuch naveen upabhedon kaa ullekh kiya he, jo is prakaar hai, mugdha : gyaatyauvana, agyatayauvana
 Mugdha is again a newborn, Vishrabandhanavoda
 oodhaa : gupta, vidagdha, lakshitha, kulata, anushayna,, mudita
 In Bharata's situational classification, Bhanudatta has added a new distinction named Proshyapatika, which later became known as Pravatsyapatika
 abhisarika ke antargat unhone jyotsnabhisarika, tamistrabhisarika tathaa divsabhisarika kaa ullekh kiya he
 Hindi writers have followed Bhanudutt the most
 shing bhoopal evam vishwanath ne samanya ke do upabhedon kaa ullekh kiya he : raktaa, virakta
 Vishwanath mentions five of Mugdha, five of Madhyas, and six of Praglbha, but the number of heroines does not include these charges
 goswami ne keval "harivallabhaon" ko nayika maanate hue samanya ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 He has also considered Mugdha, Madhyam, Pragalbha Bhide under Parakiya
 rup goswami dwaara ullikhit mugdha ke chha:, madhya ke chaar tathaa pragalbha ke saat prabhed vishwanath krit prabhedon se milte julate hai
 The number of heroic texts in Hindi is more than two hundred, but most of them are unpublished
 sarvaadhik lokapriy granthon main matiram kaa "rasraj" tathaa padmakar kaa "jagadvinod" agrani hai
 Bhanudutt's "rasamanjari" is often followed in these texts
 paristhiti-bhed-vargeekaran main aagatapatika naam kaa ek dasavaan bhed joda gaya he, jise hindi ke adhikansh lekhakon na aarambh se hi sweekaar kiya he
 Rahim's "barwai-heroine-distinction" also became famous due to the melody of the Barwai verses
 anya praarambhik granthon main "hit-tarangini", "sahityalahari", "rasmanjri", "rasikapriya", "sundarshringaar", "sudhanidhi", "kavikulakalpataru" tathaa "bhashaabhushan" ke naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 Kumaramani Shastri, Dev, Dev, Rasleen and Bhikharidas are more important due to their original contribution in later writers
 nayikabhed ke kshetra main aadhunik kaal main hariudh, biharilal bhatta tathaa prabhudayal mital ne ullekhneey kaary kiya he
 Kriparam's "hitarangarani" is the first available treatise on heroine in Hindi, yet it discusses the subject in great detail
 is granth kii kuch moulik udbhaavnaayen is prakaar hai- Surdas's "sahitya Lahiri" is a style of code
 iskaa prayek pad praaia: kisi ek alankaar tathaa kisi ek nayika kaa udhaaharan prastut karata he
 Samanya was not recognized in this book
 nandadaas kii "rasmanjri" kii apni visheshtaayen hai
 Samanya's statement has been made in this, but no importance has been given to him
 isamen nayikaon kii paribhaashaayen itani vistrut hai ki vanrya nayika kaa chitra sa prastut ho jaataa he or udaahranon kaa abhaav nahin khatkata
 Keshavdas has also mentioned Samanya in his "rasikapriya", not even given his definition
 unhone vishwanath or rup goswami ke anukaran par mugdha, madhya tathaa pragalbha ke prabhed kiye he
 Preamabhisarika, Garvabhisarika and Kamabhisarika are mentioned under the Abhinasarika, and the light and hidden name of each of the distinctions are discerned
 coccoke ke kaamshaastra sambandhi granth "ratirahasy" ke aadhaar par nayika ke padmini, chitrini, shankhini tathaa hastini bhedon kaa bhi ullekh hua he
 These distinctions have been repeated by Sundar and some other writers
 "sundarashringaar" ke anya vargeekaran praaia: "rasraj" ke samaan hai
 Tosh mentions several fundamental classifications in "sudhanidhi" - chintamani ne "kavikulakalpataru" main mugdha, tathaa pragalbha ke prabhed kiye hai
 Jaswantsinh's "bhasha Bhushan" has been a slaughtering of students due to its shortness
 isamen vibhinn nayikaon kii keval paribhaashaayen hi di gai hai
 It has special value in the form of ornamentation
 kumaarmani shastri ne "rasikarsaal" main keval naveen bhedprabhedon kaa hi ullekh nahin kiya, puraane bhedon main nae sambandh bhi sthapit kiye hai
 Their major fundamental installations are as follows - "rasvilas" main unhone pad, jati tathaa prantiyata ke aadhaar par nayikaon kaa varnan kiya he, jo chitropamata evam sookshmdarshita kii drushtiyon se adwitiya he
 The passage of "sukhsagargarang" is famous: gandharvi ke antargat, arthath saadhe das se saadhe choubees varsh tak kii avasthaa ke bich main, mugdha, madhya tathaa pragalbha ke 13 prabhedon main se prayek kii ayusima nirdhaarit kii gai he
 The most elaborate of heroines is available in Rasleen's "rasprabodh"
 unki pramukh moulik uplabdhiyaan is prakaar hai - bhikharidas has repeated many beliefs of his Tosh and Rasleen in "shringarirnayanay"
 anyasambhogadu:khitaa kaa vipralabdha ke antargat rakhkar unhone apni moulik sujh kaa parichay bhi diya he
 In modern period writers, "hariyodh" has shown its originality in the strains of Uttama and Madhyama
 unke "rasakalash" main in bhedon kaa pratham baar vibhaajan kiya gaya he, jo is prakaar he - Bihari Lal Bhatt has often accepted the beliefs of Kumaramani Shastri regarding the circumstances
 unke "sahityasagar" main dhira, adhira tathaa dhiradhira bhedon kaa sambandh keval kanishtha se mana gaya he
 Prabhudayal Mital has given recognition to the classification accepted by Bhanudatta, Matiram, Padmakar, etc
, even after thoroughly discussing the subject of heroine
 naakaabandi kaa arth he kisi bhubhag se aapurti, yuddh saamagree yaa sanchaar vyavastha ko kaat dene kaa prayaas
 This work is done either by force or partly by force
 dhyaan rahe ki naakaabandi tathaa imbargo main bahut antar he kyonki ye vyapaar main rukaawat daalate ham kintu kanoonee tareeke se, bal dwaara nahin
 The blockade is also different from a siege because the area of siege is very small

 jab kisi bachche dwaara koi kanoon-virdohi yaa samaaj virdohi kaary kiya jaataa he to use kishor aparaadh yaa bal aparaadh kehete hai
 From a legal point of view, child crime is an anti-legal act done by a child over 8 years of age and below 16 years of age, which is presented before the Children's Court for legal proceedings
 bharat main bal nyaay adhinium 1986 ke anusar 16 varsh tak kii aayu ke ladakon evam 18 varsh tak kii aayu kii ladakiyon ke aparaadh karne par bal apradhi kii shrenee main sammilit kiya gaya he
 The maximum age limit for juvenile delinquency varies from state to state
 is aadhaar par kisi bhi rajya dwaara nirdhaarit aayu seemaa ke antargat balak dwaara kiya gaya kanoonee virdohi kaary bal aparaadh he
 Not only does age determine child crime, but the seriousness of crime is also an important aspect in it
 7 se 16 varsh kaa ladkaa tathaa 7 se 18 varsh kii ladki dwaara koi bhi aisa aparaadh na kiya gaya ho jiske liye rajya mrityu dand athwa aaajeevan karawas detaa he jaise hatya, deshadroh, ghaatak akraman aadi to vah bal apradhi maani jaayegaa
 From sociological point of view, age is not given much importance for juvenile delinquency as the mental and social maturity of the person is not always affected by age, hence some scholars consider the behavior trend manifested by the child as the basis for child crime, such as loitering , Absent from school, disobeying parents and guardians, using obscene language, characterless person Keep in touch with issues and more
 kintu jab tak koi vaid tarika sarvasammiti se sweekaar nahin kar liya jaataa tab tak aayu ko hi bal aparaadh kaa nirdharak aadhaar mana jaayegaa
 According to Gillin and Gillin, from a sociological point of view, a child criminal is a person whose behavior is considered harmful by the society and therefore he is prohibited by it
 is prakaar bal aparaadh main baalko ke asaamaajik vyavhaaron ko liya jaataa he athwa baalkon ke aise vyavhaara kaa jo lok kalyaan kii drushti se ahitkar hote hai, aise kaaryon ko karne vaala bal apradhi kahala ta he
 According to Robinson, loitering, begging, aimless hovering around the abdomen, euphoria are signs of child criminality
 upurkt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par kanoon kii avagya karne vaala evam samaaj virdohi aacharan karne vaala balak bal apradhi hota he jaisaa ki newmar kaa kahana he ki bal apradhi ek nishchit aayu se kam vah vyakti he jisane samaaj viradhi kaary kiya he tathaa jiskaa durvyavhaar kanoon ko todane vaala he
 It has been known by psychological and sociological studies that convictions in humans are born in childhood
 ankekshanon dwaara yah tathy prakat hua he ki sabase adhik or gambhir aparaadh karanevaale kishoravastha ke hi balak hote hai
 From this point of view, Cashore crime is being seen as an important legal, social, moral and psychological problem
 kaishor aparaadhon kaa swaroop saamaanya aparaadhon se bhinn hota he
 In legal terminology, it is a crime to conduct against the prescribed laws of the country, but the Cashore crime is a sociological and psychological suffix
 kishor avasthaa ke baalkon dwaara kiye gaye ve sabhi vyavhaar jo kanoonee hi nahin varan kisi bhi drushti se samaaj tathaa vyakti ke liye ahitkar hon, kaishor aparaadh kii seemaa main aate he
 As --- running away from school is not a legal offense, but is socially and psychologically harmful
 yah ek ore to sabhi prakaar ke uttardayitvon se bhaagna sikhaati he or duusari ore balak ko uchit kaary se hataakar anuchit kaaryon kii ore prerit karti he
 Thus the area of cashore crime is more extensive
 kishoravastha main vyaktitv ke nirmaan tathaa vyavhaar ke nirdhaaran main vaataavaran kaa bahut haath hota he; at: apane uchit yaa anuchit vyavhaar ke liye kishor balak swayan nahin varan uskaa vaataavaran uttaradaayi hota he
 For this reason, many countries have separate jurisdictions for cashbor crimes; Their judges and other jurisdictions are knowledgeable in child psychology
 vahaan bal-aparaadhiyon ko dand nahin diya jaataa, balki unke jeevanavrutt ke aadhaar par unka tathaa unke vaataavaran kaa adhyayan karke vaataavaran main sthit asantoshjanak, falat: aparaadhon ko janm denevaale, tatwon main sudhaar karke bacchon ke sudhaar kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 Sympathetic, love, kindness, and condolences to the delinquent children are treated
 bharat main bhi kuch rajyon main balanyaayalayon or balsudhargrihon kii sthapana kii gai he
 There are different views as to why teenage boys commit crimes
 maanavshasriyon ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki aparaadh kaa sambandh vanshanukram, shaareerik banaavat evam jatigat visheshtaon se he
 For this reason, all the people of the criminal caste are of the same caste characteristics and same physical design and they commit the same crime
 shareeravaigyanikon kaa mat bhi isi se miltaa julata he
 According to them, a person with a special type of physical structure and process will commit a special type of crime
 kintu manovigyaan ne siddh kiya he ki aparaadh kaa sambandh na to uttaradhikaar se hota he or na shaareerik banaavat se ; uttaradhikaar main keval shaareerik visheshtaayen hi praapt hoti hai, unka vyakti kii bhaawanaaon, aakankshaon, pravritiyon evam buddhi se sidhaa sambandh nahin hota
 Sociologists have said that the originator of crime is a polluted environment, such as - poverty, devastated family, criminal partner etc
 kintu aadhunik manovaigyanik shodhon dwaara yah janaa gaya he ki ek hi vaataavaran hi nahi varan ek hi parivaar main paley, ek hi matapita ke bacchon main se ekaadh hi apradhi hota he, sabhi nahin
 If there is a birthplace of crime, then other brothers and sisters should also become criminals
 aadhunik manovigyaan kaishor aparaadhon kaa mul manovaigyanik sthitiyon main dhoondhata he
 According to him every child has certain desires, aspirations and needs
 unhen puraa karne kaa vah praytn karata he
 His efforts face many obstacles, which he tries to win
 apane prayatnon ke fal se vah yaa to santusht hota he yaa asantusht athwa udasin
 But the feelings of apathy are rare
 santosh or asantosh kaa sambandh safalataa yaa uplabdhi se nahin hai varan santosh aapekshik pratyay he
 The poor farmer can remain content in his situation; But not a millionaire businessman
 asantosh ko dur karne kaa prayaas maanav swabhaav he
 When the methods accepted by the society to overcome it fail, then the person adopts a method which is successful, even if it is harmful to the society and rejected by it
 tabhi vah apradhi ban jaataa he
 Like --- a weak student can remain satisfied in his condition by failing to notice his weakness; But a fast student of class can commit suicide even after passing in third class
 prashn santosh or asantosh kii maatra kaa he
 The conclusion is that even if the child is suffering from physical weakness, his intelligence is poor, his parents are criminals, his environment is poor, the same achievements are of low standard, yet he will not become a criminal unless he is from his position Do not become dissatisfied and his socialized efforts to remove dissatisfaction have not failed
 aparaadh ek prakaar kaa atmaprakashan tathaa vyavhaar he
 Juvenile delinquencies are also natural modes of behavior, only their consequences are detrimental to society and the individual
 at: samaaj ko is ahitkar sthiti se bachaane ke liye manavaigyanik kii sahaayta se abhibhavakon tathaa adhyapakon ko yah dekhnaa hoga ki bachche ke apradhi aacharan kii karanbhoot koun si asantoshjanak sthitiyaan vidyaman he
 Remove the cause of the disease, the disease will disappear, this is the principle of medicine
 apradhi vyavhaar bhi saamaajik rog he
 Due to this, the culprit behavior itself will be eliminated on removing the unsatisfactory situation and the criminal child will become a worthy member of society and a responsible citizen of the country by becoming a grown up
 bhartiya samaaj main bal aparaadh kii dar dinodin badhati ja rahi he, saath hi isaki prakruti bhi jatil hoti ja rahi he
 The reason for this is that in the present time the process of urbanization and industrialization has created an environment in which most of the families are failing to control the children
 vaiyaktik swantatrata main vruddhi ke kaaran naitik mulya bikharane lage hai, iske saath hi atyadhik pratispardhaa ne baalkon main vichlan ko paidaa kiya he
 The availability of computers and Internet has separated them from society
 falswaroop ve avsaad ke shikaar hokar aparaadhaa main lipt ho rahe hai
 According to the statistics of 2000, a total of 9,267 cases were registered under the Indian Penal Code and 5,154 cases were registered under local and special laws
 bal aparaadh kii dar main vibhinn varsho main utaar-chadhaav dekhne ko miltaa he
 In 1997, the rate of crime in boys was 0
8 percent, the same was increased to 1,0 percent in 1998 and thereafter it was 0
9 percent in 1999-200
 baalkon dwaara kiye gayi aparaadhon me se bhartiya dand samhita ke antargat sabase adhik sampatti sambandhi the
 In 2000, out of total cognizable offenses under the Penal Code, cases of theft, robbery and burglary were found, besides sexual harassment, robbery, murder, rape
 bhartiya dand samhita ke antargat bal aparaadh kii sarvaadhik dar madhyapradesh main 2,681 or maharashtra main paayi gayi
 Similarly, high rates of child crime were also found in metros like Bombay, Delhi
 bal aparaadh vyavhaar kii style or samay main vividhta pradarshit karata he
 Each type has its own social context
 kaaran hote he tathaa virodh or upachaar ke alag swaroop hote hai jo ki upyukt samajhe jate hai
 Howard Baker has described four types of child crime
 yah vah bal aparaadh he jisamen ek vyakti hi aparaadhik kaary karne main sanlagn hota he
 And the reason for this is also found in the criminal
 is apradhi vyavhaar kii adhiktar vyakhyaayein manochiktsik samajhaate hai, unka tark he ki bal aparaadh doshapurn paariwarik antakriya pratimaanon se upji manovaigyanik samasyaon ke kaaran kiye jate hai
 Heale and Broner compared the criminal youths to their own non-existent peers and analyzed the differences between them
 unki sabase mahatvapurn uplabdhi yah thi ki 13
0 pratishat anpradhi sahodaaron kii tulana me 90
0 pratishat apradhi kishaaron kaa gharelu jivan dukh bharaa tha or vipane jivan kii paristhitiyon se asantusht the, unki aprasannataa kii prakruti bhinn thi
 Some felt neglected by parents and others either felt inferior or jealous of their siblings or were suffering from mental stress, they were involved in crime to solve these problems, because of this or So they would get their parents' attention or get support from their peers or reduce their guilt
 bandoora or walterm ne shwet bal aparaadhiyon ke krityon kii tulana anpradhi ladako se hi jinamein aarthik kathinaayeeyon ke spasht sanket nahin the, unhen pataa chalaa kii apradhi anpraadheeyon se unki maataaon ke saath sambandhon kii drushti se thodaa sa bhinn hi he, lekin unke pitaaon ke saath apane sambandhon main kuch adhik bhinn the, is prakaar aparaadh main pita putr sambandh, mata putr sambandh kii apeksha adhik mahatvapurn dikhaai die kyonki apane pita main adarsh bhoomika kii anupasthiti ke kaaran apradhi ladke naitik mulyon kaa antareekaran nahin kar sake, iske saath hi unka anushaasan adhik kathor tha
 In this type of crime, child crime happens with other children and it is not found in the person's personality or family, but in the person's family and neighborhood culture
 thressure shaw or maike ke adhyayan bhi isi prakaar ke bal aparaadh kii baat karte hai, mukhya rup se yah paaya gaya ki yuvak apradhi isliai bana kyonki vah pehle se hi apradhi vyaktiyon kii sangati main rahata tha, baad main sadarland ne is tathy ko spasht rup se prastut kiye
 Which developed the theory of various connections
 isamen ve aparaadh sammilit hai jo aupchaarik rup se sangathit girohon dwaara kiye jate hai, is prakaar ke aparaadhon kaa vishleshan san 1950 ke dashak main america main kiya gaya tha tathaa apradhi upsanskruti kii avadharana kaa vikaas kiya gaya tha
 This concept points to the values and norms that dictate the behavior of group members, encourage them to commit crimes, position them on such acts and clarify their relationships with those individuals There are groups which are outside the criteria
 sthitijanya aparaadh kii manyata yah he ki aparaadh gahari jade nahin rakhata or aparaadh ke prakaar or iske niyantrit karne ke saadhan apekshaakrit bahut saral hote hai, ek yuvak kii aparaadh ke prati gahari nishtha ke bina apradhi krity main sanlagn ho jaataa he, yah yaa to kam viksit, antah ninyatran ke kaaran hota he yaa parivaar ninyatran main kamajori ke kaaran yaa is vichaar ke kaaran ki yadi vah pakadaa bhi jaataa he to bhi uski adhik haani nahin hogi
 David Matja has referred to a similar type of crime
 vibhinn vidwaanon ne vibhinn adharon par bal-aparaadhiyon kaa vargeekaran kiya gaya he
 For example, they are classified into 6 categories

 bacchon ke sharir or swasthya kaa sambadh uske vanshanukraman se bhi he jo ki uski shaareerik or saamaajik bhoomikaaon ko prabhavit karata he, italy ke aparaadhashaqui lombroso ne to apradhi pravriti ko vyakti kii shaareerik visheshtaon se janit hi mana tha

 hansaa seth, car, bart, bezehot, sulenger va gluk aadi anek vidwaanon ne apane adhyayanon main paaya ki bhagn parivaar bal aparaadh ke janak he
 Children are imitators, they learn every good and bad thing from the elders on the basis of imitation, if the elder siblings in the family are criminals and treat them badly then the personality of the children gets distorted, the tone of rebellious spirit in them They become asserted, they start living out of the downtrodden environment and become criminals after receiving wrong messages, or parents do not give equal affection to children

 In modern society, as a result of urbanization, the person does not get enough place to live, even the big family has to live in a very small place
 iske kaaran mata-pita na to bacchon par purna dhyaan de pate hai, na hi koi aantarik suraksha unhen mil paati he, manoranjan ke saadhan bhi uplabdh nahin hote hai, atah bachche aparaadh kii ore pravruth ho jate hai, mata-pita swany hi unhen baahar bhejnaa pansad karte he, jahaan bachche apradhi baalkon kii sangati praapt karte hai or swayan bhi apradhi ban jate hai

 Residence in the criminal area is also closely related to the criminal trend, there are more opportunities for children to be criminals when prostitutes are located, gamblers, alcoholics have more residence because of the high prevalence of imitation and suggestion of children
 There is a possibility of learning, Shaw and Manne said that many places are not safe to keep children, the city center Crimes are more prevalent in the business sector, as the rate of crime decreases from the center of the city to the periphery, Heale and Broner believe that slum children are affected by prevailing patterns of crime

 There is no disharmony between these two eras, which suggests that there was no significant change in the physical condition of the earth before this era

 Chakamaye Kalp strata of Kashmir also fall in this category
 doosraa, mahadwipiya nikshep jo salt range, sindh or baluchistan main miltaa he
 The third sea-raised bed, which is found in the valley of the Narmada River, from Gwalior to the tiger and on the eastern banks of India, mainly in Trichinapalli
 chauthaa varg akshareey jaljon kaa he, jo madhya pradesh or jabalpur main lameta shailasamooh ke naam se vikhyath hai
 The fifth category consists of igneous rocks which are under South Sopanasham and extend from Bombay, Hyderabad, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat to Bihar
 bharat ke bhudroni nikshep do bhaagon main bante hai: neeche paae janevaale balua pathar, jo jiumal shailasamul kehalaate hai or unke upar milanevaale shail, jinhen chikkam samooh kehete hai
 The tigers and the deposits in Trichinapalli are of great importance in the deposits of the Chakmay Kalpa of India, as they not only reveal the physical incidences in Apharra of this era, but also know the living beings of that time

 Sushma Munindra is a Hindi writer and prose writer
 inaki pramukh rachanaayen nimnavat hai: The flow of charge carriers generated due to excess heat from a surface or against a potential-energy barrier is called thermogenic emission
 praaia: sabhi log is baat se parichit hai ki dhaatuon main vidyut chaalakata swatantra electranon kii gati ke kaaran hoti he
 By independent electrons we mean electrons that are not related to any other molecule or atom
 kintu ye electron dhaatu ke dharaatal kaa vyatikraman nahin kar sakate, kyonki dhaatu ke dharaatal par gurutvkarshan ke samaan bal hota he
 In order to cross the surface, the electrons have to do as much work as they do to overcome this force like gravity
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki in electranon kii gatij urja itani adhik honi chahie ki ve chaalak ke is dharaatal-bal ko paar kar saken
 At ordinary temperatures, the kinetic energy of electrons is not so high that they can come out of the metal surface without the help of any external energy
 yah bahya urja apati vikiran ke rup main mil sakati he yaa atyant vegagami kanon dwaara praapt ho sakati he jo in dhaatuon ke dharaatal par prahaar karen
 But if the heat of the conductor is somehow increased, which gives the independent electrons the energy needed to bring them out of the metal surface, then that action is called thermogenic emission
 dharaatal ke kshetrafal ke prayek ekak se nikle hue electranon kii sankhya nimnlikhit sameekaran se pradarshit kii ja sakati he : In which j = ikai kshetrafal se nikalne vaali dhara t = absolute temperature of the substance that emits an electron; w = kaarymatra jo ek electron ke us kaary ke baraabar hoti he jo usko dhaatu ke dharaatal se baahar aane ke liye karnaa padataa he
 a = constant which depends on the emitter properties; e = napriy laghunakon kaa aadhaar Ordinary materials emit significant amounts of electrons around a temperature of 1000 ° K
 yah ek mahatvapurn baat he jiskaa dhyaan un padaarthon ke chunaav main rakhana padataa he jo utsarjak ke rup main prayukt hote hai, kyonki is taap par nasht honevaale padaarthon kaa upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The second thing that is kept in mind is the life of the emitter
 keval ve hi padaarth utsarjak ke rup main prayog main laae ja sakate hai jinka jivan lagbhag 1,000 ghanton kaa ho
 Keeping these ideas in mind, if only those substances which can be used as emitters are found, a very small number of substances will be found
 vyapaarik rup main electron naliyon main prayog main laae janevaale utsarjak yaa to oxide lepit utsarjak hote hai athwa tungsten yaa thorium yukt tungsten hote hai
 Now we will consider the things on which thermogenic emissions depend
 ek nishchit taap par tapayanic dhara kaa pattic voltata ke saath kaa parivartan chitra 1 main pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 From this diagram it can be seen that the thermogenic current does not change according to Ohm's theory
 pehle to yah pattic voltata ke badhane par dhire-dhire badhati he, phir kuch teji se or ant main sthir ho jaati he
 Its saturated current is called
 is prakaar kii vakr rekhaayen vibhinn nishchit tapon par praapt ho sakati hai
 In order to study the effect of heat, the band voltage is increased enough that the saturated current starts flowing
 phir utsarjak kaa taap parivartit kiya jaataa he or santrupt dhara vibhinn tapon par laayi jaati he
 When this value of saturated current is represented by graphs with different values of heat, the curve shown in Figure 2 is obtained
 nimna tapon par tapayanic utsarjan praaia: naganya hi hota he
 Thermogenic emissions begin around 1000 ° Kelvin and then accelerate as the temperature increases
 utsarjak ke kshetrafal kii vruddhi ke saath utsarjan kii maatra bhi badhati jaati he
 If the area is large, the thermogenic current is also high
 shuddh padaarthon main tapayanic utsarjan keval ucch tapon par hi hota he
 It has been observed that the presence of impurities affects the emission
 kshareey dhaatu utsarjak ke rup main adhik kriyasheel hoti he
 In 1908, Venault made an important discovery
 usne yah dekha ki jab electron nalee main prayukt utsarjak ko kshareey oxide se lepit kiya jaataa he to tapayanic utsarjan bahut adhik bad jaataa he
 Such emitters are very useful at low temperatures and low voltages
 aajkal adhiktar electron naliyon runagra kiran naliyon tathaa gas naliyon main oxide lepit utsarjak hi prayog main laae jate hai
 If a small amount of gas is transported in a vacuum tube, then the thermogenic emissions increase significantly
 udhaaharan ke liye hydrogen kii nunatam maatra bhi ek nirvaat nalee main pahunchne par tapayanic dhara ko 105 guna badha sakati he
 There are two reasons for this
 ek to ynikaran he jo electranon ko itani gatij urja prapt ho jaati he ki ve gas ke parmaanuon ko muthbhedon dwaara yanon main parivartit kar dete hai
 In this way the number of electrons is greatly increased
 adhishoshit anu athwa parmaanu vidyut kii ek dvigun sataha dhaatu ke dharaatal par bana lete hai, jo yaa to utsarjan main sahaayak hoti he yaa usko kam kar detii he
 Whether or not it is helpful depends on the nature of those atoms
 Hiii The thermogenic current can only flow when the money potential between the emitter and the cylinder surrounding it is continued
 electron rin aaweshit kan hai
 For this reason, they are drawn towards the cylinder which stays on the wealth potential
 is kaaran aisa lag saktaa he ki thode hi dhan vibhav par kaaphi tapayanic dhara bah sakati he
 But it has been observed that more money potential is required to flow more current
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki bhraman karte hue electranon ke kaaran utsarjak ke paas antaran aavesh utpann ho jaataa he
 This transfer charge repels the emitting electrons
 is antaran aavesh ke prabhaav ko uchit ucch vibhav dwaara hataaya ja saktaa he
 If the voltage potential is increased enough, emissions can occur even at low temperatures
 is prakaar ke utsarjan ko sheet utsarjan kehete hai
 This cold emission requires an area of 10,000 volts per centimeter
 jaisaa pehle hi bataaya ja chukaa he, tungsten, thorium yukt tangston tathaa oxide lepit utsarjak hi praaia: is kaary main prayukt hote hai
 The following properties of these emitters are: tungsten atyadhik ucch taap par hi kaam main laayaa ja saktaa he
 For this reason it is rarely used in pure condition
 utsarjak ke rup main iskaa upyog tabhi kiya jaataa he tab ucch taap par koi anya utsarjak kaary main nahin laayaa ja saktaa he
 It is mostly used in tubes that have more than 3,500 volts
 is prakaar ke utsarjak se, usee taap par, shuddh tungsten kii apeksha kahin adhik utsarjan hota he
 The reason for this is that due to the presence of thorium the work that electrons have to do to interfere with the surface is reduced enough
 nalee main kuch gas ke rah jane ke kaaran rasinic vishaaktata utpann ho jaati he
 If the effects of collision ion and chemical toxicity are taken into account, it is seen that thorium-containing tungsten-emitting oxides are more durable than coated emitters
 is prakaar ke utsarjak barium or straunsium ke oxidon ke mishran ko upyukt dhaatu ke dharaatal par potkar banaae jate hai
 Generally nickel metal is used in this work
 kabhi-kabhi nikal kii koi mishradhatu bhi prayukt hoti he
 If this type of surface is properly formed and activated, a sufficient amount of electron emission occurs at 1150 ° A
 aisa prathit hota he ki utsarjan dhaatu ke swatantra kanon se hota he jo oxide lep kii sataha par rahete hai
 Oxide coated emitters are more commonly used in vacuum tubes
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki oxide lepit utsarjak anya prakaar ke utsarjakon kii tulana main prayek wat ushma shakti ke liye adhik utsarjan detaa he tathaa anya utsarjakon kii tulana main prati varg centimetre adhik anpiyar detaa he
 a particularly advantageous feature of oxi-coated emitters is that it can emit excess electrons at the same time, even if it is only a few micro seconds
 prayog main laae janevaale utsarjak praaia: do prakaar ke hote hai
 The first type of emitters remain in the form of filaments, in which currents are heated by heating and heated to greater temperatures
 duusare prakaar ke utsarjak ve hote hai jo paroksh rup se garam kiye jate hai
 These are in the form of a thin sheet of metal
 yah belan bahya pruthakkrut tungsten dhaatu ke tantuon se garam kiya jaataa he, jise taapak kehete hai
 It has been known since long ago that if a metal is harassed by a stream of electrons, a secondary light is produced
 isi ko gaun utsarjan kehete hai
 It is of great importance in thermogenic tubes because it manifests in the tube as an undesired effect
 praathmik electron se pratadit hone par gaun electron kii sankhya praathmik electranon kii gati par or us vastu ke swabhaav tathaa dasha par nirbhar rahati he jo pratadit kii jaati he
 Secondary emission does not occur if the speed of the preceding electrons is too low
 gaun electron main praaia: 90 pratishat aise hote hai jinka veg praathmik electranon se bahut kam heta he
 However, some secondary electrons are also emitted whose velocity is higher than the primary electrons and many percent are those whose velocity is equal to the velocity of the primary electrons
 pruthakkari se gaun utsarjan-pruthakkari se honevaala gaun utsarjan kabhi-kabhi dhaatuon ke utsarjan se adhik laabhadaayak hota he
 a notable and well-known example of this is the electrode being electrically exposed to the walls of the tube
 doosraa udhaaharan he runagrakiran naliyon ke pratibhaas patton kaa vidyunmay hona
 Secondary emissions from separators are used in various types of collection tubes used in the present day

 gaison ke dravan kii vibhinn pramukh vidhiyaan nimnlikhit hai : In this method, the gas is cooled sufficiently and then cold and high pressure are used simultaneously
 parantu thandak un vibhinn dravon ke upyog se praapt kii jaati he jinka ubaal bindu krmanusaar kam hota jaataa he
 For this reason, this method is called "cascade method" or "series refrigeration"
 skiret ne oxygen ko is vidhi se sarvapratham dravit kiya
 Wroblowski and Olszewski obtained a large amount of liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen and liquid carbon dioxide by this method and studied their properties
 olszevski ne antim stage main drav-ithilin kaa prayog kiya, jisase vah uparyukt gaison ko unke "critical taap" ke neeche tak thanda kar sakaa
 Camerling Ones continuously dissolved oxygen by using methyl-chloride and ethylene in this method
 iskaa upyeg audyogic str par bhi kiya gaya
 By this method, air can also be liquefied
 iske liye hamen upkaran kaa ek chauthaa bhaag prayog main laana padegaa, jisamen drav oxygen hawa ko uske kranthik taap tak thanda karne main sahaayta karegaa
 But neon, hydrogen and helium gases cannot be liquefied by this method, because no liquefied gas can produce such a low temperature, even when vaporized at a reduced pressure
 yah vidhi thodi kathin hone ke kaaran in dinon adhik upyog main nahin laai jaati
 The principles of this method are based on the joule-tomson effect and regenerative cooling
 "cascad vidhi" kii apeksha "jul-tamson prabhaav" ke upyog se do vishesh laabh he : It is sufficient to cool down the gas to the index even when under the critical temperature of the "cascade method" which is far below the index
 2
 "cascad vidhi" kii apeksha bahut kam purvathndak aavashyak hoti he
 Then, by the "joule-tamson effect", the amount of low coldness is increased by "regenerative cooling"
 punarjanan siddhant kaa is disha main sarvapratham upyeg linde, hampasan or kai dusron ne kiya
 Linde first used this method to liquefy air
 devaar ne 1898 i
 main is vidhi dwaara hydrogen kaa dravan kiya or cameraling ones ne helium kaa
 In Linde's device, over 200 "atomospheres", the contracted air is sent through a pipe cooled by water, where the heat of the air is increased by shrinking
 taduparant sikudi hui hawa aisi kundalakaar nalee se bheji jaati he jiske antim sire par sookshm bahidwar hota he
 When the air comes out of the microscopic outflow, it expands and its temperature drops
 yah thandi hawa ab upar kii ore badhati he or pun: "compressant pump" main chali jaati he
 This cold air is almost at external pressure and the air inside the annular tube is cooled
 baar baar sikudne evam failane ke kaaran vah taap praapt ho jaataa he jo hawa ke dravan ke liye paryaapt hota he
 Linde's device was powered by a three-horsepower device and provided one liter of fluid air per hour
 yadhyapi jul-tamson prabhaav par aadhaarit dravanayantr vishesh upyog main hai, phir bhi ve purnataya santoshjanak nahin kahe ja sakate, kyonki unki kshamta kareeb 15% he
 The method proved to be definitive and effective based on the principles of gases diffusion
 yon to picktate ne hi pehle "cascad vidhi" se oxygen kaa dravan kiya tha, parantu ruddhoshm prasaran vidhi se oxygen kaa dravan callerat ne 1877 i
 main kiya
 The proliferative method was not a continuous method
 at: is vidhi kaa upyog audyogic str par tab tak nahin hua jab tak claude evam helent ne hawa ke dravan ke liye naveen vidhi kaa vikaas nahin kiya
 The biggest difficulty was which lubricants to be used in the moving parts of the machine, as all the ordinary lubricants were converted into solids at the respective temperatures
 claude ne is kathinaayee ko petroleum ether ke upyog se dur kar diya, jo - 160 degree sein
 tak chipchipa rahata he
 The compressible gas in the clawed device is sent through a pipe, which then divides into two branches at one place
 gas kii kuch maatra prasaran silinder par kaary karke use dhakel detii he or swayan thandi ho jaati he
 Now this cold gas goes upwards from the bottom due to which the gas coming down in the tube of the liquefaction becomes cold
 nalee kii yah gas jab sookshm nikaas dwaar par nikalati he tab failati he or thandi hokar dravit ho jaati he
 The amount of gas left to liquefy again goes into the compression pump and thus the entire action is repeated
 san 1934 i
 main capiza ne claude vidhi se helium evam hidrogen kaa dravan kiya
 In 1947 AD, he developed an industrial helium-liquefaction machine by Collins's Capiza method
 yah vidhi paramashunya taap kii prapti kii disha main vishesh mahatvapurn he
 Prior to the development of this method, the lowest obtainable temperatures were those of liquid helium and solid helium, which were obtained respectively
 san 1926 i
 main peter debaai ne saidhantik aadhaaron par yah spasht kar diya ki or bhi nimna taap samchumbakeey lavenon ke ruddhoshm vichumbakan dwaara praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In the act of giving magnetic force to an object, its temperature increases slightly
 at: iske vipareet yadi koi chumbakeey vastu vichumbakit kii jaati he to vah thandi ho jaati he
 The above theoretical prediction was proved in 1934 by Simon and Kurti, Geok and mcdougal
 samchumbakeey vastu kha ek dirghavrittaj athwa gole ke aakaar main glass tub k main rakhi jaati he, jo devaar botalon ga, gha evam c se ghira hota he
 These include liquid helium, liquid hydrogen and liquid air respectively
 yah puraa samooh vidyucchumbak ke uttar dakshin siron ke madhya rakh diya jaataa he
 Magnetic power is given to object b inside a magnetic field of 10,000 gauss
 chumbakatv kriya main jo ushma utpann hoti he use hydrogen gas ke bahaav se baahar kar dete hai
 Meanwhile, the experimental object returns to the temperature of the liquid helium
 tabhi chumbakeey kshetra tod diya jaataa he, jiske kaaran vastu kha kaa ruddhoshm vichumbakan ho jaataa he
 The experimental object heats up and collapses
 rochak baat to yah he ki de haas ne 1944 i
 main vidhi dwaara 0
002 degree kelvin tak taap praapt kar liya
 The experimental utility of liquid gases has its own special significance
 atyant nimna tapon kii utpatti ne, jo drav hawa, drav hydrogen evam drav helium dwaara prapya he, vaigyanik anusandhanon kii ek nutan evam brihat shakha khol di he
 This fact has necessitated that every modern laboratory must have at least one liquid-air device
 drav hawa kii bottlen ab apekshaakrit kam mulyon par evam saralata se uplabdh hai
 The air-efficient distillation method is the primary method of obtaining oxygen industrially
 chunki nitrogen kaa kvathanank - 195 degree sein
 he or oxygen kaa - 183 degree sein
, at: jo bhaag sarvapratham vaashparup main aata he usamen nitrogen kaa bahulya hota he
 The end that comes in the form of vapor has a multiplicity of oxygen in it, so only some major parts of the air will be completely separated by the actions of a powerful distillation
 isi vidhi se viral gaison ko bhi praapt kiya gaya he
 Fluid air can be divided into two parts: first more volatile and second less volatile
 pehle bhaag ko drav hydrogen se thanda karne par hydrogen ke alaava anya gaisen pruthak bhaag main praapt ho jaayengi
 Similarly, helium and neon can be obtained from the air
 devaar ne vastuon ke kam taap par vishisht ushma ke anusandhan ke liye drav hawa, drav oxygen, drav hydrogen ke ushmamapiyon kaa upyog kiya
 The thermodynamic fluid of liquid hydrogen can be measured up to 0
003 calories
 yah drav gaison ke upyog se ho sakati he
 For example, if a vessel, which contains less volatile gas than air, the liquid is surrounded by air, then all the gas inside will be converted into solid and thus a high vacuum will be generated

 In this way the upper atmosphere sitting in the laboratory can also be studied

 nylon aarthik rup se mahatvapurn he or iskaa prayog daant ke burushon, vastron, mozon, ityadi main hota he
 Like other thermoplastics, it melts at high temperatures, so its clothing is very hazardous when exposed to fire because it melts and sticks to the skin and then catches fire, due to which it is now used more in other objects
 Such as in electronics, musical instruments, etc

 TQM gives full authority from employee to CEO to strengthen the overall organization, so that they can ensure management and quality through proper processes through improvement channels in their respective products and services Take responsibility All types of organizations, from small businesses to government agencies like NASA, from schools to construction companies, from construction centers to dance sequences and hospitals have deployed TQM
 TQM kisi vishesh prakaar ke udhyam ke liye nahin he, yah to ek aisa siddhant he, jo har prakaar ke udhyam main gunvattta laane ke liye jaruri he
 TQM goes beyond this common understanding to "meet the needs" of customers and, for their purpose, appropriate
 arthath yah sanghathan ko vyapak banaata he
 Quality testing before TQM was usually the norm for quality control in the final stages of a product, process, or service
 If a defect was found, supply was halted, the product was rebuilt or rejected
 Maintaining quality The additional cost was unavoidable for TQM, the aim being to reduce avoidable costs by producing the right effort every time
 TQM, harek kami kaa mukhya kaaran jaananaa chahta he, taaki utpaada main koi kami na rahe l TQM emphasizes quality assurance using simple procedures
 or lagaataar sudhari v prabhavi sanchalit prakriyaaon dwaara utpaada v sevaaon main aaye parivartan kaa saamana karata he
 It offers the solution to remove, avoid and remove those defects by identifying the most prevalent and costly defects

 At normal times, TQM takes a long period of 10 years to make changes
 It will take several years to mature
 The decline in general is the result of a lack of commitment at higher management levels

 American organizations that have embraced the concepts of TQM since the 1980s have demonstrated their abilities for excellence, these efforts in the form of the National Quality Award, Europe's EFQM Excellence Award and the Deming Prize awarded to the Japanese internationally Are being implemented all around and are also being standardized
 Ta and some of these have contributed through energy conservation, environmental upgradation, signifying service to society, which is absolutely essential for implementing any TQM

 In 1985, Obama was one of the leaders of the May Day effort to focus on New York City's subway system, Obama traveled to several metro stations to sign letters addressed to local authorities and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and The system was photographed at the college's metro station in which a protest was held against the condition of the system
 probiotic ek prakaar ke khaadya padaarth hote hai, jisamen jivit jeevanu yaa sookshmjeev shaamil hote hai
 The probiotic method was introduced by Russian scientist Eli Massnikoff in the 20th century
 iske liye unhen baad main nobel puraskaar se bhi sammanit kiya gaya tha
 According to the World Health Organization, probiotics are living microorganisms that, when consumed, ensure the essential elements in the human body
 ye sharir main achche jeevanuon kii sankhya main vruddhi kar pachan kriya ko behatar banaate hai
 According to this method, there are two types of bacteria in the body, a friend and an enemy
 bhojan ke dwaara yadi mitra jeevanuon ko bheetar len to ve dhire-dhire sharir main uplabdh shatru jeevanuon ko nasht karne main kargar siddh hote hai
 Friendly bacteria are derived from natural sources and food, such as milk, yogurt and some plants
 abhi tak maatr teen-chaar hi aise jeevanu gyaat hai jinka prayog probiotic rup main kiya jaataa he
 Among them are Lactobacillus, Bifido, Yeast and Bacilli
 inhen ekatra karke probiotic khaadya padaarth main daalaa jaataa he
 According to the studies of scientists so far, the bacteria that reach the body in this way do not cause any harm
 shodhon main rogon ke rokthaam main inaki bhoomika sakaaratmak pai gai he tathaa inke koi dushprabhav bhi gyaat nahin hai
 The human digestive system is filled with a large number of microorganisms, which help digest food
 in sahyogi jeevanuon ke sang hi pachan tantra main kai aise jeevanu bhi hote hai jinase rog aadi failane kii ashanka rahati he
 Probiotic bacteria make it possible for flora to settle in the digestive system and control the spread of harmful bacteria
 is kaaran se hi praayah lambey samay tak antibiotic dawa dene ke baad chikitsak rogi ko probiotic lene kaa paraamarsh dete hai
 In cases of prolonged illness, allied bacteria are lost, which directly affects the digestive system
 ise jaivasurakshit khaadya bhi kehete hai
 Apart from this, it is also helpful in controlling diseases caused by probiotic infection
 yah sharir main lactose intolerance ko bhi vyavasthit karte hai
 Due to the amount of lactose, many times children and adults are unable to digest milk, it is called lactose intake
 doodh kaa seven bacchon ke liye paramaavashyak he kyonki yah calcium kaa pramukh strot he
 Probiotic bacteria are helpful in this
 probiotic main lactic amla jeevanu hote hai jo doodh main upasthit lactose shakkar ko lactic amla main parivartit dete he
 Probiotic foods also prevent colon cancer
 kuch shodh se gyaat hua he ki probiotic utpaadon kaa prayog karne vaale logon main colon cancer hone kii sambhaavna behad kam hoti he
 It also controls cholesterol
 doodh or formented khaadya utpaadon ke prayog se raktchaap bhi niyantran main rahata he
 It is also beneficial for the human body's immune system, which enables the body to protect itself from germs
 lactobacilas evam bifidobactrium khaadya or poorak se diaria ke rokthaam main bhi madad milti he
 Consumption of probiotics also controls infectious bowel disease and hyper sensitivity response in adults
 inke upyog se sookshm khanijon ke avasorana main hone vaali samasyaayein bhi samaapt ho sakati hai
 Probiotic foods are very popular in developed countries
 vahaan par inke prabhaavon ko lekar kaaphi adhyayan bhi hue hai jo yah siddh karte hai ki ye kuch bimariyon se bachaav main laabhadaayak ho sakate hai
 But their role in treatment has not yet been confirmed
 atev bhartiya chikitsavidon ke anusaar probiotic khaadya ko to dawa ke rup main nahin varan maatr khaadya purk rup main lenaa chahie
 According to the Health Department Advisor of India, there has been a lot of research on probiotic food abroad
 in shodhon ke anusaar probiotic padaarth diaria, madhumeh, loar resperetary infections, motopa ghataane, iritable boul syndrome, aadi se bachaav main kargar hue hai
 Regular intake of these also stops blood pressure and cholesterol rise
 diaria sankraman main inkaa prayog upachaar rup main kargar he
 So far these results are based on studies done on foreign people, and trials on Indian people are yet to be done
 bharat ke liye bhartiya chikitsa anusandhan parishad ne probiotic khaadya padaarthon kaa niyaman karne hetu maargdarshika taiyaar kii he, jo janvari 2010 se lagu hogi
 These guides have been prepared under the National Food Security Act
 isamen pramukh praavdhaan yah he ki koi bhi probiotic company inase kisi rog ke dur hone kaa daawa nahin kar sakegi
 If the company wants to do this, it will also have to register its products for experimental testing and their human experimental tests will be done like medicines and only then will the company be able to do so
 or itnaa hone par us khaadya ko khaadya na hokar probiotic dawaai kii shrenee main rakhaa ja sakegaa
 The probiotic foods industry in the world is about 14 billion dollars
 bharat main madar deyari, amul, nirulaaj or yakult va kai anya companiyaan probiotic doodh or dahi bazaar main launch kar chuki hai

 saamaajik poonji ke vichaar ko naye sire se praasangik banane kaa shrey america samaaj-vigyaan ko jaataa he
 Similar beliefs have been noted since the time of French sociologist Emile Durkheim, but in the last decade of the twentieth century American sociology circles began to debate this in a new tone
 america samaaj main naagarik sansthaaon kii girti hui sadsyta se paidaa hue sarokaaron kii is bahes ke peeche mukhya bhoomika rahi
 Social scientists have observed that the activities of social institutions in the US have come to a standstill due to the tendency of the generation born after the Great Depression and World War to disappear and be imprisoned in the home world by electronic means of entertainment
 iske prati anukriya karte hue robert putanam ne saamaajik poonji kii avadharana ko tatola
 The formulation that emerges from Durkheim's sociological perspective as social cohesion and its mechanical and organic dimensions is reflected in Putnam's discourse
 saamaajik poonji ke siddhant ke marm main aagrah yah he ki saamaajik networkon ke mahatva ko nazarandaaz nahin kiya janaa chahie kyonki saamaajik sampark vyaktiyon or unke samoohon kii utpaadakta ko prabhavit karte hai
 People use their contacts and relationships as an important resource for various purposes
 ve jaise hi kisi samasya main faste hai yaa unke jivan main koi parivartan hota he, ve doston, naate-rishton or parijanon ko awaz dete hai
 a group of people join hands to try to serve their common interests
 isi baat ko vyapak dharaatal par is prakaar kaha ja saktaa he ki saamaajik sanghathan ke sabhi rup antarvaiyaktik sambandhon ke dhaagon se bandhe hote hai
 In the mid-nineties Robert Putnam wrote several controversial articles on this question
 iske baad 2000 main tathyon- aankadon se bhari hui unki vishleshnatmak pustak bouling alon prakashit hui jiske pannon par darj ek vichlit kar dene vaali chhavi ne sabhi kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 In this book, Putnam shows that the American people are playing alone in a bowling alley, while until recently there were different teams playing together under an organized league
 nabbe ke dashak main hui bahes se pehle saamaajik poonji ke vichaar ke saath samudaay kii avadharana nahin jodi jaati thi
 However, Putnam and his colleagues argued that the importance of social capital is not limited to the individual, but also guarantees a broader social interest
 saamaajik poonji ke str main giravat aane par samudaay ke astitv par hi vipareet asar padataa he
 Putnam's efforts rejuvenated the traditions of political sociology under which voluntary organizations were believed to form individuals and form a wider world
 unnisvin sadi main alaxis da tokvil ne america loktantr se sambandhit apane vikhyath avlokanon main dikhaaya tha ki kis tarah vibhinn hit-samooh or naagarik sanghathan nirantar anyonyakriya ke madhyam se puri loktantric vyavastha kii ekajutata banaaye hue hai
 It should be noted that the talk of Europe was about the belief that the same role of bringing stability there has been played by the continuing traditions led by the monarchy and the oligarchy
 putanam ke vichaaron kii praasangikta kaa andaaza is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki media ne unhen hatho-haath liya or unka prabhaav samaaj-vigyaan ke daayaron ke pare chalaa gaya
 He got the opportunity to speak on countless radio and TV programs
 do america raashtrapatiyon ne unase raay lee or kai europee pradhanmantriyon ne unke vichaaron par gaur kiya
 Prior to Putnam, other intellectuals had tried to investigate various socio-political phenomena in the mirror of social relationships and networks
 jine jaikabs dwaara vibhinn shaharon main hone vaale aparaadhon ke bich fark kaa pataa lagane ke liye saamaajik rishton kii asamanta kaa adhyayan kiya chukaa tha
 On the basis of this idea, French sociologist Pier Bordeaux had explained the reproduction of socio-economic equality in different directions
 bordiyo ne apane saathi loik vaakaan ke saath prakashit rachana main likhaa tha ki saamaajik poonji aise vaastavik or niraakaar sansadhano kaa yogafal he jo kisi vyakti yaa samooh ko kisi saamaajik network kii sadsyta kii badaulat hasil hote hai
 These networks survive through ties that have taken almost institutional form of mutual acquaintance
 vyakti apni saamaajik poonji ke aadhaar par hasil kii gayi us saamaajik-aarthik haisiyat ko agali peedi ke hawaale kar paata he jo usne prabhaavshaalee parijanon, mahange skulon main padhane vaale apane sahpaathiyon or kisi khaas club ke saathi sadasyon kii sohabat ke badaulat hasil kii hoti he
 To keep this social capital constantly relevant and effective, one invests his or her planned time in mutual interaction
 is vyakhya se spasht he ki bordiyo saath ke dashak main prachlit varg-vishleshan ke nav-marxvaadi daayre main chintan kar rahe the
 He was interested in showing how groups of elites maintain the continuity of their power
 iske vipareet james colman ne saamaajik poonji kii avadharana kaa istemaal karte hue kai african-american hai skool chaatro ke bich kiye gayi anubhavik adhyayanon ke zariye dikhaaya ki parivaar or samudaay dwaara mili hue gunon dwaara kam aamadani or achche skool main padhane kii suvidha na mil paane jaisi kamiyon kii bharpai ho jaati he
 Such qualities play an important role in a child's cognitive development
 colman ek aise samajashastri the jinaki arthshaastra main kaafii dilchaspee thi
 He criticized the rational social selection theory, saying that this theory can explain the attitude based on individual personal interest, but cannot understand cooperative behavior and altruistic attitude
 is lihaaz se saamaajik poonji kaa siddhant rashnal chois thiyari kii yah kami puri kar detaa he
 Needless to say that the concept of social capital was helpful in maintaining a high and low profile in the eyes of Bordeaux, and Coleman saw it as helping to advance the disadvantaged groups
 haalaanki yah ek ahm maanakeey antar tha, par kul mila kar donon hi vidwaanon ne is siddhant ke vibhinn ayaamon ko samrudh kiya
 When the debate began around it in the nineties, this theory was questioned anew and a lot of factual arguments were raised in favor of their arguments
 kuch adhyayanon se spasht hua ki saamaajik networkon kaa laabh asaamaajik or aparaadhik maksadon se bhi uthaaya jaataa he
 Some networks reinforce values and codes of conduct under which people become unable to diagnose problems properly
 bahes yah bhi hui ki is siddhant kaa kitna hissaa samajashastreey he or kitna arthshaastri
 Under this, it was asked whether the word capital is being used only as a metaphor in it or social capital can be measured and the rate of profit can be derived from it

 bhautik vigyaan main krishnika padaarth kii ek adarshikrut avasthaa he, jo apane upar padane vaale sabhi vidyut chumbakeey vikiran avashoshit kar letaa he
 The black body absorbs radiation in a special and continuous spectrum and is re-emitted when heated
 kyonki koi bhi prakaash parilakshith yaa sancharit nahin hota he or vastu jab thandi hoti he, to kaali dikhaai detii he
 However, a black body emits a temperature dependent light spectrum
 krishnika se nikle is saura vikiran ko krishnika vikiran kaha jaataa he
 The shorter the length of the wave in the spectrum of the black body, the higher the frequency and the higher the frequency is related to the higher temperature
 is prakaar, ek garm vastu kaa rang varnakram ke nile ant ke kareeb hota he or ek thandi vastu kaa rang laal ke kareeb hota he
 At room temperature, the black body emits mostly infrared wavelengths, but when the temperature rises a few hundred degrees Celsius, the black body emits visible wavelengths, which look red, orange, yellow, bright, blue as the temperature rises
 vastu ke safed hone tak vah paryaapt maatra main parabangnee vikiran utsarjit karti he
 The term "krishnika" was introduced in 1860 by Gustav Kirchhoff
 jab iskaa yogic visheshan ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he, to yah shabd aam taur par "krishnika vikiran" yaa " blakebody radiation" ke rup main ek shabd main sanyukt ho jaataa he
 The black body emission provides insight into the solar equilibrium state of a continuous field
 shastreey bhautikee main saura santulan main prayek alag-alag foorier mod main samaan urja honi chahie
 This approach led to a paradox, known as the ultraviolet disaster, and containing an enormous amount of energy in the field of sustainable living
 krishnika saura santulan ke gunon kaa pareekshan kar sakate hai, kyonki ve jo surya kii kirnon dwaara vitarit kiye jane vaale vikiran utsarjit karte hai
 Historically, the concept of quantum mechanics came from studying the laws of the black body
 krishnika kaa vikiran ek khaas taapmaana main krishnika ke saath saura santulan or prakaash vikiran kaa prakaash hota he
 This refers to the thermodynamics equilibrium state of light
 prayogtmak rup se yah krishnika yukt ek kathor-deevaaron vaali guha main sthir sthiti santulan vikiran ke rup main sthapit ho chukaa he
 There are no strongly true black bodies in nature but graphite is a good analogy and a closed box with graphite walls at steady state is a good approximation of the ideal radiation of a black body
 ek guha, jisamen koi krishnika nahin he, vah santulan kii sthiti main krishnika vikiran barkaraar rakhane main sakasham nahin he, yah tathy kirchaaf dwaara prayogtmak rup se paaya gaya he, lekin iskaa bhautik mahatv na to kirchaaf ne samajha or na hi plank ne
 Since light is a oscillating form of a constant electromagnetic field, radiation-studies of the black body reveal how temperatures occur in continuous fields, contradicting classical physics
 kyonki kwantum yantriki ke aagaman se pehle prakaash kii saura sthiti itani bhramit karne vaali thi ki 19 veen sadi ke in tarkon ko kaaphi saavdhaanee se pesh kiya gaya ki prakaash kii ek saura santulan sthiti hoti he
 At fixed temperatures, a substance in t can be seen glowing like an oven
 jis bindu par sabhi thos padaarth ek mand laal chamak paidaa karte hai, us bindu ko draper bindu naam diya gaya
 An oven at 1000 k looks red and at 6000 k it looks white
 jab tak oven kaaphi chamakdaar nahin hota tab tak isse koi antar nahin padataa he ki bhatthi kaa nirmaan kaise kiya gaya he, prakaash kaa rang keval taapmaana par nirbhar karata he
 Since color is a directly visible measure of wavelength, this means that light at different temperatures distributes different energies between different wavelengths
 tii taapmaana par λ tarangadairghy main prati unit volum i urja kii maatra ko krishnika ghumaav kii avasthaa kaha jaataa he
 Detailed experiments have shown that the state of rotation of the black body depends only on the temperature and not on the emitted material
 This suggests that light, like any other object, actually comes from solar equilibrium and thus the concept of light at t temperature is understandable
 samaan taapmaana par do chijen santulan main rah sakati hai, jaise tii taapmaana par prakaash ke badal se ghira padaarth tii taapmaana par ausat rup se badal main utana prakaash vikirit kar saktaa he, jitna vah sokh le, yah privost ke vinimay siddhant par aadhaarit he, jo vikaranshil santulan ko sandarbhit karata he
 The principle of broad equilibrium states that there is no peculiar correlation between the process of emission and absorption, that the process of emission is not affected by absorption but only by the solar state of the emitting material
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki tii taapmaana par padaarth dwaara utsarjit kul prakaash, chaahe vah krishna padaarth ho yaa nahi, hameshaa us kul prakaash ke baraabar hota he, jise padaarth avashoshit karata he, jo tii taapmaana par prakaash se ghira ho
 The amount of light absorbed for a black body is as much as it falls on the surface
 kisi bhi tarangadairghy λ ke prati ikai samay main avashoshit prakaash urja anivaary rup se krishnika ke karv ke anupaat main hoti he
 This means that the rotation of the black body is as much as the light energy emitted by the black body, which justifies its name
 yah saura vikiran kaa kirchof niyam he: krishnika kaa utsarjan ghumaav prakaash kii saura visheshta he, jo keval guha kii deevaaron kewapamanaper hi nirbhar karata he, basharte yah sthiti honi aavashyak he ki guha main kuch puri tarah se kaali saamagree ho or yah vikaranshil santulan main ho
 Absorption is modified when the black body is so small that its size can be compared to the wavelength of light, because a small object cannot be an efficient absorber of light of long wavelength, but the principle of rigorous equality of emission and absorption Are always justified
 prayogshaala main, krishnika ke vikiran kii maatra kaa anumaan ek badi guha ke praveshdwar par ek chote chhed, ekahohalerum, jisamen krishnika hota he or jise santulan tak pahunchaaya jaataa he or barkaraar rakhaa jaataa he, ke jariye lagaaya jaataa he
 
 The light entering the hole has to be reflected several times on the walls of the cavity before being released, in which process it becomes almost certain to be absorbed
 yah pravesh kar rahe vikiran ke tarangadairghy se matlab rakhe bina bhi ho saktaa he 
 tab yah chhed ek saidhantik krishnika ke kareebi sanniktan ke rup main hoga or yadi guha ko garm kiya jaye to chhed ke vikiran kaa varnakram satat hoga, haalanki yah bhi puri sunishchit karnaa hoga ki guha main lagbhag puri tarah se kaali kuch saamagree rakhi gai ho or yah bhi ki santulan kaayam kiya gaya he or ise barkaraar rakhaa gaya he, lekin in praavdhaanon ke saath, yah aage guha kii anya samagriyon par ashrith nahin rahati he
 
 19 veen sadi ke uttararddh ke dauraan saidhantik bhautikee main krishnika ke ghumaav kii gananaa ek pramukh chunauti thi
 The problem was finally solved in 1901 by Max Planck's Planck law of black-body radiation
 thermodynemics or electromangnetismo se talmail rakhte hue unhone vaayen ke vikiran niyam main badlaav kiye or ek santoshjanak tareeke se prayogtmak data ke upyukt ek ganitiya sutara paaya
 To get a physical explanation of his formula, Planck then assumed that the energy of oscillation in the cavity was balanced
 oinstin ne is vichaar ko aage badhaayaa or 1905 main hi photo electric prabhaav kii vyakhya karne ke liye prastaavit vidyut chumbakeey vikiran ke parimanikaran kaa prastaav diya
 These theoretical advances eventually resulted in the elimination of classical electromagnetism by quantum electrodynamics
 aaj, in quanta ko photonkaha jaataa hai or sochaa ja saktaa he ki krishnika kii guha main photons kii gas ho sakati hai
 Furthermore, it guided the development of quantum probability distributions, called fermi-direc statics and bose-einstein statics, and each of these particles applied to different classes, which were used in quantum mechanics instead of classical distributions
 
 pheramion or boson bhi dekhen 
 The wavelength at which radiation is strongest is called the Vaughan displacement law and the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the Stefan Boltzmann law
 atah jaise-jaise taapmaana badhata he, chamak kaa rang laal se pile or phir safed se nile main parivartit hota he
 Even as the peak wavelength enters the ultraviolet, enough radiation continues to be emitted at the blue wavelength, causing the substance to appear blue
 yah kabhi bhi adrishy nahin hoga- vastav main, drishy prakaash kaa vikiran taapmaana ke saath ek gati se badhata rahata he
 Brightness or supervised intensity is not a function of direction
 isliye ek krishnika ek paripurna lambartian radiator hota he
 Real objects never behave like absolute ideal dark matter, and instead radiation emitted at a fixed frequency is a fraction of the ideal emission possible
 ek saamagree kaa utsarjan bataata he ki ek vaastavik padaarth ek krishnika kii tulana main kitni acchhee tarah urja kaa vikiran karata he
 This {0} emission { / 0} depends on many factors, such as temperature, direction of emission, and wavelength
 haalanki, ejineering main yah maan vishisht he ki ek sataha kaa varnakrameey utsarjan or avasorana tarangadairghy par nirbhar nahin karte hai, isliye utsarjan ek nirantar prakriya he
 This is known as gray body prediction
 gaiyr-kaali satahon se nipatane ke kram main adarsh kaale-padaarth ke vyavhaar kaa apsaran jyamitiya sanrachana or rasinic samishran donon dwaara nirdhaarit hota hai or yah bhi tay hona chahie lagbhag krishnika kaa vikaranshil santulan vartmaan ho
 This is closer to the Kircharf law: emission is equal to absorption, so an object that does not absorb all the light falling will emit less radiation than an ideal black body
 khagol vigyaan main taron jaise pindon ko aksar krishnika mana jaataa he, haalanki yah ek kamjor sanniktan he
 a nearly complete black-body radiation spectrum is represented by cosmic microwave background radiation
 vikiran kaa failaav kaale chhed dwaara utsarjit ek kaalpanik krishnika vikiran he
 Although Planck's formula predicts that a black body will radiate energy at all frequencies, this formula will only apply if multiple photons are being measured
 udhaaharan ke liye, kamare ke taapmaana par ek vargametre ke sataha kshetra main ek krishnika prayek 41 second par ek photone kii ausat dar par drishy range par ek photone utsarjit karegaa, iskaa matlab yah hua ki zyaadaatar vyaavhaarik prayojanon main ek aisa krishnika drishy paraas main utsarjan nahin karegaa
 Although a black body is a theoretical object, the general application of a source to infrared radiation is defined as a black body when the object reaches an emission of 1
0
 jab ek avarakt vikiran kaa strot 0
99 se kam ho to ise "grey body" ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 Applications of black-body simulation typically include testing and calibration of infrared systems and infrared sensor equipment
 ati krishnika aisa hi ek udhaaharan he, jo nikal-phosphorus mishra dhaatu se banaaya jaataa he
 More recently, a team of Japanese scientists has created a material very close to the black body, based on single-walled carbon nanotubes at a perpendicular angle, in the spectral range of 98% to 99% of the incident light from ultraviolet infrared
 % Absorbs part
 plank kaa niyam kahata he ki ki where vaayen kaa visthaapan niyam dikhaata he ki kisi bhi taapmaana par krishnika kaa vikiran kisi anya taapmaana par varnakram se kis tarah sambandhit he
 If we know the size of the spectrum at one temperature, then we can calculate the size at another temperature
 vaayen ke visthaapan niyam kaa ek parinaam yah he ki ek tarangadairghy, jis par krishnika dwaara utpaadit vikiran kii tivrata adhiktam hoti he, λ m a x { \ displaystyle \ lambda _{ \ mathrm {max} }}, yah keval taapmaana kaa kaary he Where the constant B, known as the displacement continuum of the vane, equals 2
8977685 × 10−3 m K
 dhyaan rahe ki chotii kii tivrata ko prati unit tarangadairghy yaa prati unit aavriti kii tivrata ke sandarbh main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 The above expression for peak wavelength represents the intensity per unit wavelength; Whereas the above section of Planck's law is known in terms of frequency per unit
 aavriti, jis par prati ikai urja aavriti adhiktam hoti he use This rule states that the energy emitted per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to one-fourth the energy of its absolute temperature
 arthath Where j * is the radiated total energy per unit area, t is the temperature and σ = 5
67 × 10−8 w m − 2 k − 4 is the Stefan – Boltzmann constant
 krishnika niyam manushyon par bhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, some of a person's energy is radiated as electromagnetic radiation, most of which is infrared
 shuddh vikiran urja utsarjit urja or avashoshit urja ke bich kaa antar hoti he: Applying the stefan-boltzmann rule, ek vayask kaa kul sataha kshetra 2 m2 hota he or twachaa kaa madhya tathaa dur-avaraktautsarjan tathaa kapadon kaa zyaadaatar hissaa ekbaddhata ke kareeb hota he, kyonki yah sabase adhik gaiyr-dhaatu sataha hota he
 The skin temperature is 33 ° C, but the fabric reduces the surface temperature to 28 ° C, while the ambient temperature is 20 ° C
 isliye, shuddh vikiransheel ushma kaa nuksaan kareeb nimnaankit hota he The total energy radiated in a day is 9 MJ, or 2000 kcal

 However, a sluggish adult has a moderate metabolic rate of 50 to 70%, which is higher than their basal rate
 sanvahan or vashpikaran sahit anya mahatvapurn thermal nuksaan tantra bhi hota he
 Convection is negligible because the Nusselt number is much higher than unity
 vashpikaran kii jarurat tabhi hoti he, jab taapmaana kii lagaataar avasthaa ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye vikiran or sanvahan aparyaapt hote hai
 Free convection rates are comparable, albeit somewhat lower, than radiative rates
 is prakaar, vikiran thande va sthir hawa main do tihaai tapiya urja ke nuksaan ke baraabar hota he
 This can only be taken as a rough approximation given the approximate nature of many assumptions
 pariveshi vaayu gati, balaat sanvahan paidaa karata he, yaa vashpikaran ek thermal nuksaan tantra ke rup main vikiran kaa tulanaatmak mahatv kam kar detaa he
 Furthermore, when applying the law of wyne to humans it is found that the peak wavelength of light emitted by a person is
 yahi kaaran he ki maanav vishyon ke liye banaaye gayi thermal imaging upkaran 7000-14000 nanometers tarangadairghy ke prati adhik samvedansheel hote hai
 The black-matter law has been used to roughly estimate the temperature of a planet
 sataha greenhouse prabhaav ke kaaran adhik garm ho sakati he
 The temperature of a planet depends on some factors: aantarik grahon ke liye, ghatana or utsarjit vikiran kaa taapmaana par sabase zyada mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 This derivation is mainly related to it
 stephen-boltzman niyam surya dwaara utsarjit kul urja detaa he
 where surya sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se urja utsarjit karata he
 Because of this, the Earth is warmed by only a small fraction of it
 surya kii jo urja prithvi par padati he vah he: so ucch taapmaana ke kaaran, suraj baari maatra main parabangnee or drishy aavriti range par utsarjan karata he
 In this frequency range, the Earth reflects a fraction of this energy 1- α { \ displaystyle \ alpha}, where α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} is the Earth's albedo and reflection in the uv-vis range
 duusare shabdon main, prithvi surya ke prakaash kaa ek ansh 1 − α { \ displaystyle 1- \ alpha } avashoshit karti he or baaki ko paravartit kar detii he
 The energy absorbed by the Earth and its atmosphere is expressed as: yahaan tak ki prithvi ek golakaar kshetra π r 2 { \ displaystyle \ pi R^{2}} ke rup main hi avashoshit karti he, yah kshetra kii sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se utsarjan karti he
 If the Earth were a perfect black body, it would emit according to the Stephan – Boltzmann method
 jahaan T_{E} prithvi kaa taapmaana hota he
 The Earth, since it has a much lower temperature than the Sun, emits only the infrared part of most of the spectrum
 is aavriti range main, yah us vikiran ko utsarjit ε ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ overline { \ epsilon }}} karti he, jo ek krishnika dwaara ε ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ overline { \ epsilon }}} iaar range main utsarjit ausat utsarjaktaa he
 So the energy emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere is as follows: yah maanate hue ki prithvi ushn santulan main he, avashoshit urja avashya hi utsarjit urja ke baraabar honi aavashyak he : Substituting the power of solar and earth in equations 1-6 and in simple form it can be called: duusare shabdon main, manyataon ke mutabik, prithvi kaa taapmaana keval surya, surya kii trigya, prithvi or surya ke bich duuri, albido or prithvi ke iaar utsarjan ke taapmaana par hi nirbhar karata he
 If we substitute the measured values for the Sun and Earth: agar ham unity kaa ausat utsarjan tay karen, ham gananaa kar sakate hai ki prithvi kaa "prabhavi taapmaana" aisa hoga : This is what the Earth would be if it radiated into a perfect black body in the infrared, ignoring the greenhouse effect and in the event of an irreversible albedo
 vastav main prithvi avarakt main lagbhag ek purna krishnika ke rup vikirn hoti he, jo anumaanit taapmaana ko prabhavi taapmaana se kuch hi degree zyada adhik badhaayegaa
 yadi ham anumaan karnaa chahen ki agar koi vaataavaran nahin ho to prithvi kaa taapmaana kya hoga, to hamen ek anumaan ke achche jariye ke rup main albido or chand ke utsarjan kaa dhyaan main rakhana hoga
 The emission of albedo and the moon are about 0
1054 k and 0,95 respectively, which is estimated to produce temperatures of around 1
36 ° C
 prithvi kaa ausat albido kaa anumaan 0
3-0
4 range ke bich bhinn-bhinn hota he, jiske parinamswaroop alag-alag anumaanit prabhavi taapmaana dikhataa he
 Estimation is often based on solar continuity rather than temperature, size, and distance to the sun
 udhaaharan ke liye, albido ke liye 0
4 kaa or 1400 w m−2) ke ek aatapan ke upyog ke jariye kareeb 245 ke prabhavi taapmaana praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly using albedo 0
3 and solar continuity 1372 w m − 2), one can achieve an effective temperature of 255 K
 dopalar prabhaav ek acchhee tarah gyaat tathy he, jo yah varnit karata he ki prakaash kii aavritiyaan tab kis tarah "sthanantarit" ho jaati hai, jab ek prakaash strot paryvekshak ke saapeksh gum rahaa hota he
 If f is the emitted frequency of a monochromatic light source, it will appear at the f frequency when it is moving relative to the observer
 jahaan v paryvekshak ke rest frem main veg kaa strot he, to θ veg sadish or paryvekshak strot disha ke bich kaa kone he or si prakaash kii gati he
 This is a completely relativistic formula and can be simplified in special cases of objects that are moving in a straight direction or away from the observer and have a much lower speed than C
 ek chalyman krishnika ke varnakram kii gananaa karne ke liye, yah spasht lagata he ki krishnika varnakram kii prayek aavriti ke liye yah sutara lagu hota he
 However, simply scaling each frequency like this is not enough
 hamen dikh rahe vivar ke parimit aakaar kaa hisaab rakhana hota he, kyonki prakaash praapt kar rahaa thos kone bhi lorentj ke badlaav se prabhavit hota he
 When this effect is included, it is found that the black body at temperature t is decreasing with the v velocity, which seems to have the same spectrum as the black body stationary at t temperature
 jaise In a case in which the source is moving directly towards or away from the observer, it is reduced yahan v >0 sanket karata he ki yah kam ho rahaa strot he or v <0 nikat aa rahe strot kii ore sanket karata he
 This is an important influence in astronomy, where the velocity of stars and galaxies can reach significant degrees of c
 brahmadia sookshm tarang prishthbhumi vikiran main ek udhaaharan paaya gaya he, jo is krishnika ke vikiran kshetra ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati se ek dwidhruviya asamdigvarti hone kii dasha pradarshit karata he
