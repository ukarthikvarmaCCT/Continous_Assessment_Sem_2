 yah sab karte hue uski mulaakaat chupchaap rahane vaali, kitabon main khoyi rahane vaali jaimi elizabeth sulivin se hoti he, jo carch ke hi padri kii ekmaatr beti he
 He was known to this girl for a long time, but rarely did he interact with it
 Despite being physically very close to each other, their different social surroundings made them residents of two poles of the world
 naatak ke liye apni line yaad karne main landan ko jab kuch pareshaani pesh aati he to vah jaimi se madad maangata
 vah madad ke liye sahamat bhi ho jaati he, lekin is vaade ke saath ki vah usase pyaar na karne lage
 jaimi kii ajeeb baton par landan ko hansi aati he, lekin use yah bhi lagane lagata he ki jaimi hi vah ladki he, jiske prem main vah kabhi-na-kabhi pad hi jayega
 aakhikar landan shahar kii sabase sundar or sabase lokapriy ladki ke kareeb aa hi jaataa he, kyonki apane sharmile swabhaav or puraane fishan ke pahanaave ke bich vah ek alag kism kii ladki thi
 After school, Laindon began practicing drama with Jamie at his home
 kuch had tak donon dost ban gaye, is bich landan ko pataa chalaa ki jaimi apane jivan main kya kuch karnaa chaahati he, uski usne ek ichha suchi bana rakhi he; jisame ek tatu banane or ek hi samay main do jagah maujuud rahane jaisi ichha shaamil he
 One day Jamie arrives at Laindon, where he was patrolling along with some of his friends
 jab jaimi landan se puuchhati he ki agar vah chaahe to ve donon dopaher ke samay naatak kaa abhyaas kar sakate hai to iske jawaab main landan uski khilli udate kahata he, "tumhaare sapanom main
"yah sunakar uske dost hansane lagate hai or landan ke khilli udaane se jaimi kaa cheharaa apmaan or sharmindagi se bhar jaataa he
 On the same day at noon, Laindon arrives at Jamie with the hope that she will still help him
 But Jamie refused to open the door
 Finally he opened the door and told sarcastically that they could both be "secret friends"
 or jab landan is baat par sahamat ho gaya to usne darwaja uske saamne jor se band kar diya
 antat landan apane aap hi script yaad karata he
 During the play, Jamie surprises all the audience present there with his beauty and voice, including Laindon
 naatak ke ant main landan jaimi ko chuum letaa he, jabaki naatak ke patakatha main aisa kuch nahin tha
 Laindon tries to get close to Jamie, but she repeatedly rebuffs
 landan ke doston dwaara jaimi kaa bhadda majaak udaane ke baad hi landan ko samajhane ko taiyaar hui
 dean or belinda ko ghuse maarane ke baad vah jaimi ko ghar le gaya
 a relationship between the two started to flourish
 Laindon asks Jamie to go to dinner with him, but in response he refuses to go on a date with Laindon
 Laindon was so desperate to go on a date with Jamie that he goes to his father in church and asks for permission to take Jamie out for dinner
 lekin uske pita manaa kar dete hai
 Laindon asks Jamie's father to trust him
 antat ve maan jate hai
 Laindon takes Jamie out to dinner and dances with him there
 yah sab isse pehle kabhi usne kisi ke saath nahin kiya tha
 Laindon then helps fulfill some of Jamie's wish lists
 ek yaadgaar date ke taur par landan jaimi ko state line le gaya
 He enthusiastically asked Jamie to stretch both legs on the line while Jamie asked him what he was doing
 is par landan ne use bataaya ki "aisa kar vah ek hi samay main do jagahon par upasthit he
 "jamie's face glowed with joy upon seeing it
 Then he realized that Laindon had made his impossible dream come true
 One evening Laindon asks Jamie to find a star for him through the telescope
 jaimi ne usase poocha vah star kyon khoj rahaa he
 Jamie hugs her and says for the first time in a whisper, "I love you"
 ek shaam, aakhirkaar jaimi landan ko bataa detii he ki use laailaaj leukemia he or usne upachaar band kar diya he
 Landon gets upset at first
 jaimi use bataati he ki kis kaaran usne use pehle yah sab kyon nahin bataaya, kyonki vah apane jivan kaa lutf uthaa rahi he or bache hue samay kaa upyog kar rahi he
 But then Laindon was found and she fell in love with him
 Jamie cheers and says "I am not angry with God" and she leaves
 landan apane hriday rog visheshgy pita ke paas jaakar jaimi kii madad karne ke liye kahata he
 His father is a little hesitant, as he is not a leukemia specialist, yet he says that he wants to investigate Jamie and learn about his medical history before they do anything
 landan aavesh main apni pratikriya vyakt karata he
 Laindon and Jamie meet the next day
 vah use gale lagaataa he or usase kahata he ki vah hameshaa uske saath he
 Soon, news of Jamie's illness spreads
 landan kaa sabase acha dost erik, jo jaimi kaa majaak udaane main shaamil tha, aata he or usase maafi maangate hue kahata he ki vah samaj nahin paaya tha
 Later Dean and Belinda also come and apologize
 jab vah apane pita kii baahon main gir padati he, tab tak jaimi kaa cancer badtar sithiti main pahunch jaataa he
 He takes her to the hospital, where she meets Laindon
 landan jaimi ke paas hi baitha rahata he, jab tak ki uske pita baqayada use jane ko majaboor nahin kar dete
 jaimi ke pita baithte hai or usase kehete hai "agar main tumhen bahut kareeb isliye rakh, kyonki main tumhen zyada dinon tak jivit rakhana chahta hum
" jaimi apane pita se kahati he ki vah unhen bahut pyaar karti he
 And she weeps
 agle din, landan aspataal aata he or dekhtaa he wheel chair se jaimi ward ke baahar ja rahi he
 He asks Jamie what happened
 jawaab main jaimi use uske pita dwaara di gayi madad ke liye shukriya kahati he
 Laindon asks Jamie's father why he said this
 He tells her that his father is paying money for Jamie's treatment at home in private
 landan dang rah jaataa he, so vah raat main apane pita ke darvaaze par dastak detaa he
 His father calls another
 landan fusfusaate hue "dhanyavad" kahata he or uske pita use gale se laga lete hai
 In this case, Laindon weeps his father's arms due to his exhaustion and fear
 jaimi kii anek ichchhaaon ko puraa karne main landan laga rahaa, masalan ek aisa telescope banane kaa kaam, jisase vah dhoomaketu ko dekh sake
 jaimi ke pita ne, jinhone pehle use sweekaar nahin kiya tha, isamen uski madad kii
 jaimi ke us telescope se dhoomaketu dekhne ke baad, landan ke shaadi kaa prastaav ko sweekaar kar leti he
 Through this process, Laindon and Jamie learn a lot about the nature of love
 The film ends with Jamie's death, but after their marriage in the same small chapel where Jamie's mother was married, Jamie's The wish of marriage in the same chapel topped the wish list
 jaimi kii smriti ke saath landan ek behatar insaan ban jaataa he or vah jaimi kii hi tarah apane nirdhaarit lakshyon ko praapt karata he

 udhaaharan ke liye, vah college kii padhai puri karke medical skool main daakhila le letaa he, lekin jaimi se milane se pehle hai skool ke baad ke jivan ke bare main uski koi yojana thi hi nahin
 usne jaimi ke pita se kaha ki use is baat kaa afsos he ki vah jaimi kii mrityu se pehle 'koi chamatkaar' dekhne kii uski ichha ko puraa nahin kar paaya
 His father replied, "he saw

 trek suchi: Movie music list haalanki nicholas sparks dwaara likhit upanyaas se kai samanthaayen hai, lekin kai parivartan kiye gaye hai
 In his personal website, Sparks explained the decision behind these differences
 udhaaharan ke liye unhone or nirmaataa ne faisla kiya ki 1950 ke dashak ke bajaay 1990 ke dashak ke set lagaaye jaayen taaki kahani ko apadet kiya ja sake
 unhen yah ashanka thi ki film ke 50 ke dashak ke set kishoron ko aakarshith karne main asafal honge
 "unki dilchaspee ke liye," ve likhte hai, "hamen kahani ko or samakaleen bananaa tha
 "to make the update credible, Laindon's audacity and behavior had to be worse than in the novel
 Sparks writes," The behavior of teenage boys in the 1950s was considered a bit "rude", while in the 1990s The behavior of teenage boys is considered "gross"
 sparks or nirmaataa ne us naatak ko bhi badal diya, jisamen landan or jaimi hissaa lete hai
 In the novel, Hegbert wrote a Christmas drama that showed how much he once struggled as a father
 up-plat dikhaa ki vah sangharsh se ubarne main kaise kaamyaab hua, lekin samay kii kami ke kaaran film main ise shaamil nahin kiya ja sakaa
 sparks ko is baat ki chita thi ki jin logon ne kitaab nahin padhi, ve hegbert ke sambandh main yah sawaal uthaaenge ki kya vah ek acha pita tha", ve kehete hai ki "kyonki ve ek achche pita he or isliye ham is sawaal ko or adhik kheenchna nahin chaahaten, isliye hamane mudde ko hi badal diya
 One important difference between the novel and the film is that at the end of the novel it is not revealed whether Jamie dies or when cancer death was certain in the 1950s
 sparks kaa kahana he ki unhone jab kitaab likhi tab unhen pataa tha ki vah mar jaaegi, baavjood iske "jaimi sulivin ko pyaar ho gaya" or isliye mujhe yah "samaadhaan behatar laga ki is bindu par apni bahan ke prati mere man main jo bhaavana thi use vyakt ke diya jaay, isliye maine yah ummid banaaye rakhaa ki vah jivit he"
 upanyaas main landan ke pita congress sadsy hai, lekin is film main vah ek hriday rog visheshgy hai, jo jaimi ko uski beemaari main madad karte hai
 Due to his career, he has enough money to get Jamie treated at home
 chote fark bhi hai, jaise ki jaimi film main jab landan ko uski maa kii kitaab detii he to kahati hai, "chintaa mat karo, yah bible nahin he"
 upanyaas main jaimi use uski maa kii bible detii he, jisame unke pasandida ansh rekhaankit hai
 In the novel, Laindon participates in the school drama at Jamie's behest, while in the film he is forced to do so

 The story goes that Gideon Manten's wife, Mary Ann, discovered the first tooth in 1822 in Cuckfield Whitemans Green, Sussex, England, in the level of Tilgate Forest, while her husband visited a patient of a large type of herbaceous or vegetative plant
 Bhoji Gecko, which is now found only in poured form
 haalanki, vahaan koi saboot nahin he ki monten uske saath uski patni ko le liya, jabaki rogiyon dekh he
 In addition, in 1851 he admitted that he had found himself having teeth
 har koi isse sahamat hai ki kahani juthi he, haalanki yah he ki monten pehle green Whitemans main khadaan se bada jeevashm haddiyon kaa adhigrahan unki pustikaon se janaa jaataa he 1820 main

 1821 main monten shaakaahaari daant kii khoj ke liye ullekh kiya he or sambhaavna he ki ek bade shaakaahaari saanp ke str main maujuud tha par vichaar shuru kar diya
 However, in his 1822 publication Fossil of the South Downs, he did not yet dare to suggest a connection between the teeth and his very unfinished skeleton, assuming that his finds are two large forms, one carnivorous, the other herbivorous
 In May 1822, he first presented to the Geological Society of London the vegetarian teeth but members, among which William Buckland, dismissed them as incisors of fish teeth or a rhinoceros from a tertiary layer
 23 June 1823 Charles Lyell George Cuvier discovered something, during a banquet in Paris, but the famous French naturalist at once dismissed them as those of a rhinoceros
 haalanki kuwiyar agle hi din se mukar gaya, liel keval monten, jo is mudde ke bare main nahin balki shankashil ban gaya barkhaastagi kii soochna di
 In 1824 Buckland described the megalosaurus and that the Manten Collection was an invited occasion for travel
 6 march ko haddiyon ko dekhakar vah is baat par sahamat hue ki in kuch vishaal rengne vaale jaanavar the, haalanki abhi bhi yah is baat kaa khandan karte ek herbivore tha
 Still emboldened, Manten then sent some teeth to Cuvier, who replied on 22 June 1824 that he had determined that they were snakes and quite possibly are a giant herbivore
 In a new version of his Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles Cuvier that this year led to an immediate acceptance of Mantane by accepting his earlier mistake and finding a parallel modern day between the new lizard, Manten's current reptile in its scientific circles Tried further confirmation of his theory by +1,824 In September he visited the Royal College of Surgeons, but was unable to find a comparable tooth at first

 However, assistant curator Samuel Stutchbury recognized that they had an ocher he had recently prepared to resemble those now twenty times, though

 Thus various methods of categorizing the classification of food security are used in order of the most effective allocation of food relief materials
 inamen se ek sabase praarambhik vidhi 1880 ke dashak main angrejon dwaara taiyaar kii gayi bhartiya akaal samhita he
 The codes listed three stages of food insecurity: near-tightness, scarcity, and famine, in addition to the latter being extremely influential in building famine warnings or measurement systems

 The experience of famine relief organizations around the world in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in at least two major activities: the "livelihood approach" and the increased use of nutrition indicators to determine the severity of a crisis
 Stressful conditions of food will be tackled by limiting the supply of consumption by individuals and groups, which may be an alternative means of supplemental income, etc
 before trying dismal measures such as selling plots of arable land

 Since 2004, many of the most important organizations engaging in famine relief, such as the World Food Program and the US Agency for International Development, have adopted a five-stage scale to measure intensity and magnitude
 tivrata kaa paimaana kisi bhi paristhiti ko khaadya surakshit, khaadya asurakshit, khaadya sankat, akaal, gambhir akaal or charam akaal ke rup main vargeekrut karne ke liye aajeevika ke upayon or mrityu dar tathaa bal kuposhan kii maap donon kaa istemaal karata he
 The number of deaths determines the name of the magnitude, with fewer than 1000 casualties defining a "minor famine" and a "catastrophic famine" resulting in deaths of over 1,000,000 people

 Strong foods such as peanut butter pouches and spirulina have revolutionized the system of emergency food in situations of human emergency because they can be eaten directly from packets, requiring packet refrigeration or blending with scarce clean water No, they can be stored for years and most importantly they are Extremely serious as could be given to sick children

 vriddhavastha ke kaaran uske sharir kii shakti ksheen ho chuki thi
 The Prophet approached him and questioned him about it
 He said that i am a beggar of misery
 main bhookha hoon mujhe bhojan karaao, main vastraheen hoon mujhe pahanane ke liye vastra do, main kangaal hoon meri aarthik saahayata karo
 The Prophet said that i do not have anything at this time but since giving someone a way to do good is also like doing good work
 is liye paigambar ne usko hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha ke ghar kaa pataa bataa diya
 Because his house was adjacent to the mosque, he quickly came to his door and pleaded for help
 hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha ne kaha ki is samay mere paas kuch nahin he jo main tuje de sakun
 But i have a garland, you can sell it and fulfill your needs
 yah kahkar apane gale se maala utaar kar us ko dedi
 This mala was gifted by Hazrat Fatima Salamullah Alaiha, the Chacha of Hazrat Prophet
 vah is maala ko lekar paigambar ke paas aayaa tathaa kaha ki fatima ne yah maala di he
 And said that i should sell it and fulfill my needs
 
 The Prophet wept upon seeing this garland
 ammare yasir naamak aapke ek mitra aapke paas baithe hue the
 He said that allow me to buy this garland, the Prophet said that Allah will not surprise anyone who buys this garland
 ammaar ne us daridr se poocha ki tum is maala ko kitne main benchnaa chaahate ho? usne uttar diya ki main isko itane mulya par bench duungaa jitne main mujhe pahanane ke liye vastra khaane ke liye roti gosht mil jaye tathaa ek dinar mare paas batch jaye jisase main apane ghar jasakun
 Ammar Yasir said that i buy it in exchange for food cloth and twenty dinars
 vah daridr shighrata purvak taiyaar ho gaya
 Thus, Ammare Yasir bought this garland and smelled it
 tathaa apane das ko dekar kaha ki yah maala paigambar ko bhent kar va maine tuje bhi paigambar kii bhent kiya
 The Prophet also presented that garland and the slave Hazrat Fatima Salamullah Alaiha
 hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha ne maala ko le liya tathaa das se kaha ki maine tuje allaah ke liye swatantra kiya
 Das started laughing after hearing this
 hazarat fatima ne hagansane kaa kaaran poocha to usne kaha ki mujhe is maala ne hansaaya kyon ki is ne ek bhukhe ko bhojan karaayaa, ek vastraheen ko vastra pahanaaye ek paidal chalane vaale ko sawari pradaan kii ek daridr ko maldaar banaaya ek das ko swatantra karaayaa or ant main swany apane maalik ke paas aagai
