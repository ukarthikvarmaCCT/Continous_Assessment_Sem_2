 Venus has many volcanoes like the Earth and some 167 large volcanoes in every 100 km radius
 prithvi par is aakaar kii jwalamukhi jatilta keval hawaii ke bade dweep par he
 This is not because Venus is more active than Earth from a volcanic point of view, but rather its crust is older

 The reason for the fall on the moon is progressively tucker, while on the earth it is due to wind and rain erosion
 shukr par lagbhag 85% cretar pracheen haalat main hai
 The number of craters, together with their well-protected conditions, indicates the planet's passing under a global reestablishment event some 30–60 million years ago, followed by a collapse in volcanism
 jahaan ek ore prithvi kii parpati nirantar prakriyaarat he, vahiin shukr ko is tarah kii prakriya ke poshan ke liye asamarth samajha gaya he
 Without plate tectonics, Venus undergoes a cyclic process to disperse heat from its mantle in which the mantle temperature rise continues until it reaches the peak level necessary for the weakening of the layer
 Then, over a period of about 10 million years, pressure occurs on a large scale that completely recycles the crust
 shukr cretaron ke paraas vyas main 3 kimi se lekar 280 kimi tak he
 There is no crater less than 3 km due to the effect of dense atmosphere on visitor bodies

 The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests that they share the same internal structure: a core, a mantle, and a crust
 prithvi par kii hi tarah shukr kaa kor kam se kam aanshik rup se taral he kyonki in do grahon ke thande hone kii dar lagbhag ek samaan rahi he
 The slightly smaller size of Venus suggests that the pressure in its deep interior is much lower than the Earth

 This magnetic field is induced by an interplay between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than an internal dynamo, like the inner core of the Earth
 shukr kaa chota sa prerit chumbakeey kshetra vayumandal ko brahmadia vikiran ke khilaaf naganya suraksha pradaan karata he
 This radiation may be the result of lightning discharge from cloud to cloud

 One possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core, or that its core is not currently cold, so the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature
 ek or sambhaavna ki iskaa kor pehle se hi puri tarah jam gaya he
 The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is currently unknown

 When Venus lies between the Earth and the Sun, it is at its largest size and presents its "nav Kala"
 iske vayumandal ko grah ke chaaron ore ke apavartit prakaash ke prabhamandal dwaara ek doorabeen main dekha ja saktaa hai
 Venus's orbit is slightly tilted relative to the Earth's orbit; Therefore, when this planet passes between the Earth and the Sun, it usually does not cross the face of the Sun

 Historically, the transit of Venus was important, as they have allowed astronomers to directly determine the size of the astronomical unit, as well as the size of the solar system, as seen by Horrocks in 1639 by Captain Cook's Eastern Australia
 The discovery of the coast was made possible when he traveled to Tahiti in 1768 after a voyage to observe Venus transit

 In the early 17th century, when the Italian physicist Galileo Galilei made his first observation of the planet, he found it showing the moon-like arts, from crescent to ornate to full moon and vice versa
 jab yah surya se sarvaadhik dur hota he apana ardhachandra rup dikhaata he or jab surya ke sabase najadik hota he yah arddh chandrakaar yaa poornachandra kii tarah dikhataa he
 This was possible only if Venus orbited the Sun and was one of the first observations to explicitly refute Ptolemy's geocentric model, in which the solar system was centered and the Earth was at the center
 shukr ke vayumandal kii khoj 1761 main roosi bahushrut mikhail lomonosov dwaara hui thi
 The atmosphere of Venus was observed in 1790 by the German astronomer Yohan Schroter
 shroter ne paaya ki grah jab ek patala ardhchandra tha, katori 180° se adhik tak vistaarit hui
 He correctly surmised that this was due to scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere

 In fact, Mariner 5 was originally created as a backup to Mariner 4, which is related to Mars
 But when the mission was successful, the vehicle was converted for the Venus mission
 Its equipment pairs were more sensitive than those on the Mariner 2

 The crushing pressure limit of the vehicle was increased to 25 bars and equipped with small parachutes to achieve a faster descent
 baad ke, shukr ke haal ke vayumandaleey modelon ne sataha ke dabaav ko 75 or 100 baar ke bich hone kaa suzav diya tha
 Therefore, there was no hope for these vehicles to survive on the surface
 After transmitting atmospheric data for a short interval of 50 minutes, both the ships were destroyed at an altitude of about 20 km before hitting the surface of the night side of Venus
 venera 7 ko grah ke sataha se nikle data ko waapas laane ke prayaas ke liye pesh kiya gaya

 The Venera program continued with Venera 8
 After entering the atmosphere on 22 July 1972, it sent data from the surface for 50 minutes
 Venera 9 entered the atmosphere on 22 October 1975
 Whereas Venera 10 entered the atmosphere exactly three days after that on 25 October and sent the first pictures of Venus landscape
 Both vehicles presented very different scenarios in their immediate vicinity

 a total of 33 inscriptions by the Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty have been unearthed which Ashoka carved into the walls of columns, rocks and caves during his reign from 269 BC to 231 BC
 ye aadhunik bangladesh, bharat, afghanistan, pakistan or nepal main jagah-jagah par milte hai or buddha dharm ke astitv ke sabase pracheen pramaanon main se hai
 According to these inscriptions, Ashoka's efforts to spread Buddhism were active up to the Mediterranean Sea and the emperors were well aware of the political conditions up to Egypt and Greece

 The rulers described here are as follows: unani sroton se saafe gyaat nahin hota kii yah doot in raajaaon se vastav main mili bhi kii nahin or unani kshetra main inkaa kya prabhaav hua
 Nevertheless, some scholars consider the presence of the Buddhist community in Greek regions to be a sign of some degree of success of Ashoka's apostles

 agni hindu dharm main aag ke devtaa hai
 They are considered to be the means of performing sacrifices for all the gods - hence their title is India
 vaidic kaal se agni sabase unche devon main se hai
 a book called Agni Purana was also composed in the mythological era
 hindu dharm vidhi main yajna, havan or vivaahon main agni dwaara hi devataaon kii puja kii jaati he
 According to the book called Samagya Yajna, Agni's wife's name was Swaha, who was the daughter of Daksha Prajapati and Akuti
 unke teen putr paavak, pavamaan tathaa shuchi the
 Out of these, a second Manu Swarochish Manu was born and 45 types of fire were revealed from these three
 dakshina, guru ko sammanswaroop di janevaali bhent athwa yajna, shraadh or dharmik krityon ke sambandh main die janevaale dhan kaa bodhak he
 In the Gurukuls of India, when the students went to study, they would either get education by serving the Guru and his family or if he belonged to a rich family, but there were very few people who paid the fee and most of the students were educated with the same service
 Used to get praaia: aise vidhyaarthee apni shiksha samaapt kar jab gharachalane lagate tab guru ko sammaan or shraddhaswaroop kuch bhent arpit karte jo dakshina kehalaati thi
 Gradually, the practice of Gurudakshina became similar and very poor students also started trying to give some Dakshina
 yah dakshina vidhaan main aavashyak rup se dey maani gai ho, aisa nahin, kintu shraddhalu vidhyaarthee swechhaya usko den, yah kram ho gaya or aaj bhi pracheen paripati se padhanevaale vidhyaarthee gurupurnima ke din apane guruon kii dravya, fal mul, pushp or mishthann dakshina sahit puja karte hai
 The sentiment behind Dakshina was the responsibility of meeting the maintenance and economic needs of the guru who did not charge any necessary and fixed fees for the scholarship, nor would he get any fixed salary from the state or society
 is uttardaayitv kaa vahan praja ke prati kartavyanishth raajaaon ke liye aavashyak mana jaataa
 Kalidasa's story of Kautas's connection with giving Dakshina to his guru Varatantu gives a clear understanding of all the beliefs behind Dakshina
 yadi garib shishy guru kii dakshina swayan na de sake to raja se use paane kaa usko adhikaar tha or vah kisi bhi dasha main vimukh nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The second Dakshina is in relation to religious acts
 yajna bina dakshina ke purna nahin hota or uskaa koi fal nahin hota, yajna purna hone ke baad brahman or purohit ko turant dakshina di jaay or use kisi bhi avasthaa main baaki na lagaaya jaay
 At the time of resting, it increases in proportion to time
 dakshina na denevaala brahmaswapahari, ashuchi, daridr, patki, vyaadhiyukt tathaa anya anek kashton se grast ho jaataa he, uski lakshmi chali jaati he, pitar uskaa pind nahin sweekaar karte or uski kai pidiyon, aage tathaa peeche uske pariwarikon ko adhogati milti he aadi vidhaanon or bhayon kii utpatti ke peeche ek pradhan kaaran tha
 The means of earning a livelihood for the Yajna and other religious acts, which were the class of Brahmins and priests, were gradually surviving Dakshina and became their duty and profession, which no one else could afford
 dakshina na mili to ve khaaen kya? at: unhone swayan to niyam banaae hi, raajaaon or shaskaon ko bhi saamaajik or dharmik vyavasthaaon ke dwaara is baat ke liye vivash kiya ki ve dakshina na chukaanewaalon ko dandit karen
 The story of how Vishwamitra punished King Harishchandra, who had previously been his priest, for not paying the dakshina of the yajna is found in the Puranas
 ye dakshinaayen aaj bhi bhartiya jivan main dharmik krityon, yagyon or pujaaon, shraadhon or saanskarik avasaron ke pradhan ang he
 Dakshina is offered in many forms such as gold, silver, coins, grain, clothes, etc
 and keeps on decreasing according to the reverence and financial condition of Yajman
 vritti hote hue bhi uskaa maan kabhi nishchit kiya gaya ho, aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In connection with generating religious sentiments in relation to Dakshina, Dakshina developed the legend of the female form of Yagya Purush and she was also considered a goddess

 vastav me samaaj me aarthik majabuti or kshamta badhaane ke liye shram vibhaajan ke aadhaar par is pratha kii utpatti hui thi
 There was ease in this division in Aranbha and a person of one caste could adopt another caste
 parantu samay ke saath - saath is kshetra me sankirnata aa gai
 The practice of caste was not only prevalent in India but also in Egypt, Europe etc
 in a relatively weak form

 PA Sorokin writes in his book 'social Mobility', "without any level of division in the history of mankind, the resemblance of the living members is just a fantasy
" " tathaa si ech foole kaa kathan he "varg - vibhed vashanugat hota he, to use jati kahte he "
 Many opinions have been accepted in this case

 According to commercial opinion, it has arisen from family occupation
 sampraadayik mat ke anusaar jab vibhinn sammpradaay sangathit hokar apni alag jaati kaa nirmaan karte he, to ise jati pratha kii utpatti kahte he
 According to traditional belief, this practice has been created by God in terms of various tasks
 kuch log yah sochate he ki manu ne "manu smriti" me maanav samaaj ko chaar shrenio me vibhajit kiya he, brahaman, kshatriya, veshya or shudra
 According to the development theory, the caste system has arisen due to social development
 sabhyataa ke lanbe or mand vikaas ke kaaran jati pratha me kuch dosha bhi aate gaye
 Its greatest feeling is untouchability
 parantu shiksha ken prasar se yah saamaajik buraai dur hoti he ja rahi he
 There are also some characteristics of the caste system
 shram vibhaajan par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran isse shramik varg apane kaary me nipun hota gaya kyoki shram vibhaajan kaa yah kam pidhio tak chalata rahaa tha
 With this, the problem of future - election and unemployment also went away
 tathapati jati pratha mukhyat: ek buraai hi he
 Due to this, there is a spread of sentimentality and obstructs the social, national unity which is necessary for national and economic progress

 In caste system, son adopts husband's business, in this system the possibility of change of profession is very less

org / wiki / caste_system_in_india Michel Foucault was the leading thinker and philosopher of France
 phuko kii ginati 20 veen sadi ke sabase pramukh vichaarkon main se kii jaati hai
 It was the influence of Fuko's writings that revolutionary changes took place in many areas of modern science, and especially in the field of history writing
 rajya kii sanstha logon se kaise apni baat manawaati he— is samaj main sabase taaja or vicharottejak vikaas mishael phuko ne kiya he
 The bourgeoisie does not establish its social power in the state only through instruments of violence
 vah tarah-tarah ke saanskrithik roopon kaa istemaal karke bhi apni saamaajik satta kii nirantarata sunishchit karata he
 Therefore it is also necessary to understand the structures of the state in their cultural forms
 antatah rajya ke paksh main sahmati paidaa karne kii zimmedaari ye saanskrithik sanrachanaayen hi nibhaati hai
 Fuko explains that in order to control or discipline people in modern society, a multi-layered system of surveillance, besides assimilating the decisions made by others and the examination system, are adopted
 phuko jor dekar kehete hai ki logon par drushti rakhane maatr se satta kaa aadha kaam puraa ho jaataa he
 For this, he cites the arrangement of the stadium in which the seats are arranged in such a way that the audience can easily watch an event but at the same time this system also provides the power controllers to keep an eye on the audience
 yahan phuko anushaasan or niyantran kii satta kaa model chihnit karne ke liye raajnneetik chintak jeremi bantham dwaara kalpit jail panopticon kaa ullekh bhi karte hai
 The original Vastu-plan was such that the prisoners kept in the cells should be invisible to each other but could not be out of the prison's central tower
 kaidiyon ko kabhi is baat kaa pataa nahin chalata ki un par nigaah rakhi ja rahi he yaa nahin par unke mastishk main yah baat baith jaati he ki koi un par drushti rakhata he
 Fuco views the Panoptican doctrine as a metaphor that transcends the prison boundary and becomes a common pattern of discipline in schools, factories and hospitals
 haalaanki bantham kii yah prastaavit jail kabhi moort rup nahin le paayi lekin ek siddhant ke rup main vah aadhunik samaaj kii lagbhag har gatividhi par kabizj ho gayi he
 He has proved to be a tool for disciplining systems in modern society, which has overthrown the kings and princes of the pre-modern period and has established himself in their place
 is kram main phuko yah bhi darshaate hai ki aadhunik satta yaa anushaasan kaayam karne vaali vyavastha keval logon kii gatividhiyon par hi nazar nahin rakhti balki vah logon ko unki aakshamata dikhaakar bhi niyantrit karti he
 According to him, modern power creates categories like understanding, talent, normal and unusual behavior, and when a person does not meet the criteria or standards established by it, the system does not miss an opportunity to declare such person as inferior or abnormal
 is sandarbh main phuko yah yaad dilaanaa nahin bhoolatey ki aadhunik samaaj kii in anushaasankaree sansthaaon kaa yah ravaiya kisi tarah ke pratishodh se nahin balki sudhaar se prerit hota he
 The ultimate goal of which is that the person accepts the norms or standards provided by the society
 dhyaan den ki samaaj kii manyataon ke dwaara anushaasan kaayam karne kaa yah dhang nyaayik dand kii us vyavastha se khaasaa alag he jisamen kisi vyakti ko keval is aadhaar par dandit kiya jaataa tha ki uskaa krity kanoon sammat he yaa nahin
 In such a decision it was not said that the person is normal or abnormal
 lekin aadhunik samaaj shaikshik kaaryakramon, chikitsa ke taur-tareekon tathaa udyog va utpaadon ke maamalon main kuch nishchit maanak sthapit karne par jor detaa he or in maanakon kaa varchasv itnaa chautarfa hota he ki vyakti kaa vyavhaar or vyaktitv unheen ke hisaab se dhalane lagata he
 The state is generally seen as a governance, organization or political community
 mana jaataa he ki itihaas ke har daur main iske vividh rup maujuud rahe hai
 Changes in this have been the major subjects of history
 sirf aadim ghumantu raajnneetik samudaayon ko rajya kaa darza nahin diya jaataa he
 It is believed that in these communities, there is a lack of a definite system associated with this concept
 asal main rajya hone ke liye yah aavashyak he ki samudaay or bhu-kshetra ke bich takreeban sthai sambandh ho
 When used in this general way, the term expresses the idea that the political community has certain universal characteristics that go beyond time and space; That is, Greek polis, some common features between medieval regnums and modern republics
 kya is gun yaa visheshta ko zyaada sankuchit rup main paribhashit kiya ja saktaa he? It is clear that if a definition of the state presents it as an eternal and immutable object or organization, by doing so it ignores the process of change and development in history
 isliye ek vaid paribhaasha ko duusare pahaluon or kaaryon par dhyaan dena chahie
 History shows that the state as a universal phenomenon is an activity or organization imposed on human beings as necessities
 is tarah kii gatividhi ke rup main isaki kuch mukhya visheshtaayen is prakaar hai : yah manushyon or unki sampatti ke bich main ek nishchit sambandh banaata he; yaa duusare shabdon main yah manushyon ke bich ekta yaa samaaj kaa nirmaan karata he
 Therefore the existence of the state is uniquely a fundamental thing
 doosraa, yah manushyon ke bich vyavastha kii shakti, yaa shashan ke ek rup yaa aadesh or ajna paalan kaa ek sambandh sweekaar karata he
 Third, the activity that creates and sustains the state is unique, always presenting itself against people who are not part of this community
 baharhaal, rajya ko ek aitihaasik parighatna ke rup main dekhne ke baavjood is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki is par hone vaale lekhan main ek darshanik pahalu hameshaa shaamil rahaa he
 Under this, the question arises that what is the ideal form of the kind of arrangement or the state wants to establish relations between people? Has that ideal form been achieved? Is the present way of governance right? Are the external relations of the community being handled properly? In fact, considering this point of view, not only does the state emerge as a requirement imposed on human beings, but also as a problem of choice of 'right' in front of humans
 rajya main sirf araajaktaa kii jagah ek vyavastha sthapit karne kaa hi sangharsh nahin he
 Instead, it is also a struggle to establish a system that is genuine, authentic and just
 isliye, plato, arestu, hobbs, higel aadi ke lekhan ko is sawaal kaa darshanik uttar khojane kii koshish ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he ki rajya kaisaa hona chahie
 These scholars have tried to differentiate between the state and other types of human organizations and at the same time they have presented the hypothesis of their ideal state and the arguments in its favor
 saarvbhaum aitihaasik parighatna ke rup main rajya or ek darshanik avadharana ke rup main rajya ko dekhne ke vichaar ke saath rajya ko vishesh rup se aadhunik parighatna maanane ke vichaar ko bhi jodne kii aavashyaktaa he
 There are many historians and political theorists who argue that the term 'state' should be used to refer to the post-renaissance and Reformation system in Europe
 inkaa yah maananaa he ki rajya kaa sidghant darasal isi vishisht parighatna se judaa hua sidghant he
 Therefore, if it is used for organizations present in the second round of history, it will lead to confusion about its meaning
 ek sangathit vyavastha ke rup main rajya shabd kaa udai bhi chaudaavin sadi ke ant or satrahavin sadi ke bich hua
 The state's English word 'state' derives from the Latin word 'steer', meaning to stand
 is tarah yah ek sthiti ke bare main bataata he
 One of the main ideas behind considering the state as a modern concept is that the emergence of the modern state coincided with the concept of sovereignty
 yah ek spasht aadhunik manyata he ki jo rajya prabhusatta-sampann nahin he, vah sahi arthon main rajya hi nahin he
 Sovereignty means that the state is the supreme source of political authority in the territory under its purview
 prabhusatta ke do pahalu hai— aantarik pahalu or bahari pahalu
 The internal aspect means that there is no authority higher than the state within the boundaries of the state
 rajya sarvocch he or naagarik rajya ke kilaaf kisi anya praadhikari se apil nahin kar saktaa he
 External sovereignty means the recognition given by other states to a particular state
 saath hi, isamen yah bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki koi rajya antarrashtriya maamalon main apane nagarikon kii ore se bol saktaa he
 This right expresses the autonomy and sovereignty of the state in the international arena
 rajya ko ek aadhunik parighatna maanane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki ise ek aitihaasik satta yaa darshanik vichaar ke rup main bhi kaarij kar diya jaye
 It also cannot be said that no feature of the modern state was present in the earlier period of history
 asal main, aadhunik daur ke pehle ke ‘rajya’ or aadhunik daur ke saath saamne aaye ‘rajya’ kii kai visheshtaayen samaan hai
 Likewise, it cannot be said that the state as a philosophical idea represents the 'complete concept' of the modern state
 asal main darshanik rup se rajya kii avadharana alag- alag tareekon se kalpit or vivechit kii jaati rahi he
 Liberalists, for example, saw states as a 'neutral' institution, but there has been serious and varied discussion within liberalism about the role of the state
 marxvad ke bheetar bhi rajya ke lekar vaad-vivaad kii samrudgh parampara rahi he
 In this, apart from considering the state as the instrument of the capitalist classes, the debate related to 'relative autonomy of the state' has also been included
 araajaktaavaadiyon ne rajya ko ek aprakritik satta maane hue ise puri tarah khatm karne kii vakaalat kii he
 Even in the writings of marx-engels, a communist situation has been envisaged in which the state will be completely destroyed
 lekin araajaktaavaadi aisi kisi sthiti kaa intazaar karne kii bajaay rajya ko jald-se-jald khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 They believe that the state is based on violence against the natural nature of man
 duusari ore, anudaarataavaadi rajya kii tarafadaari isliye karte hai taaki vah kai pidiyon se sanchit paramparaon or mulyon kaa sangrakshan kar paye
 The state has been thought of differently in the various streams within feminists
 udhaaharan ke taur par, udaarataavaadi-nariwad yah maanata he ki ek sanstha ke rup main rajya purush varchasv kii ore jhukaa hua he, lekin kanoon banaakar rajya kii is pravriti main sudhaar kiya ja saktaa he or iskaa upyog purush-mahila samanta sthapit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, socialist-feminism considers the capitalist character of the state as the main reason for the problem of women
 isaki manyata he ki poonjeewaadi rajya khatm karne se hi striyon kii sthiti main sudhaar ho saktaa he
 Third, according to the radical feminist view, the state works to protect the family based on patriarchy and the values it promotes
 isliye pitrusatta ko puri tarah khatm karne ke liye aavashyak he ki rajya ko bhi khatm kiya jaae
 Clearly, there is much varied and intense debate about the state, its nature and role
 haal ke daur main europee union jaisi sanrachanaon ke ubhaar ke kaaran yah tark diya gaya he ki rajya dhire-dhire apraasangik ho rahaa he
 But this argument is not very strong
 yah sach he ki europee union main shaamil deshon ne ek majboot kshetreey sanghathan ko banane ke liye apni sahmati di he
 Nevertheless, they do not want to end their identity as a nation-state
 duusare kai kshetreey sanghathanon ne bhi kshetra ke deshon ke bich sahyog badhaayaa he, lekin is baat kii koi sambhaavna nazar nahin aati he ki ve raashtra-rajya kaa vikalp sabit honge
 In the contemporary world, the state is a reality that has no chance of ending
 vaicharik rup se iskaa virodh karne vaale kai vichaardhaaraon ke anuyaayi vyaavhaarik mauka milane par bhi rajya kii sanstha ko khatm kar paane main naakaam rahe hai
 Common Website: jeevani: Reference Text: patrikayen: Diverse: katyuri rajvansh bharat ke uttrakhand rajya kaa ek madhyayugin rajvansh tha jinke bare main main mana jaataa he ki ve ayodhya ke shalivahan shaasha ke vanshaj hai or isliye ve suryavanshi hai
 However, many historians associate them with the Kuninda rulers and also from the Khas origin, who ruled the Kumaon region from the 6th to the 11th centuries
 katyuri raajaaon ko giriraj chakrachudamani kii upadhi praapt thi
 His first capital was at Joshimath, which was soon shifted to Kartikeyapur
 katyuri rajvansh bhi shaq vanshavali ke maane jate hai, jaise raja shalivahan, ko bhi shaq vansh se mana jaataa he
 However, historians like Badri Dutt Pandey believe that Katyuri came from Ayodhya
 unhone apane rajya ko 'kurmanchal' kaha, arthath 'kurm kii bhoomi', kurm bhagwaan vishnu kaa doosraa avatar tha, jisase is sthaan ko iskaa vartmaan naam, kumaun mila
 Swami Karthikeya, the patriarch of the Katyuri king, sits in the Bogatan state of Nepal
 golu champavat, katyuri vansh ke raja jhalurai ke putr the
 King Jhalurai was a justice-loving, liberal and public servant of his kingdom
 unki 7 raniyaan thim, lekin putr ek bhi nahin
 Now he started worrying about his successor
 jyotishiyon ke kehane ke anusaar unhone bhagwaan bhairav kii aradhana kii or unhen prasann karne ke baad unase santan sukh kaa var maanga
 On which Bhairava said that there is no happiness of children in your luck
 chunki tumne mujhe prasann kiya he to main hi putr rup main janm luungaa lekin ab tumhen aathvin shaadi kerani hogi
 One day the king went out hunting and went astray
 unhen pyaas lagi or tab unhone apane sainikon ko kaha ki ve kahin se bhi pani dhund kar laaen
 When the soldiers did not return for long, he set out to find himself
 aakhir unhen ek talab dikhaa, lekin dekha to vahaan unke sainik behosh pade the
 But the thirsty king started trying to drink water and then a woman's voice came
 usne rukne ke liye kaha or kaha ki yah talab meraa he, meri hami ke bagaiyr yahaan se koi pani nahin pi saktaa
 This is the mistake your soldiers made, see the result
 raaj us aurat kii khubsuurati ke kaayal ho gaye
 He introduced himself and told that these are my soldiers
 tum koun ho? or mere sounikon kaa yah haal kaise? us aurat ne bataaya ki main panchdev devataaon kii bahan kalinga hu
 If you are a king, then separate the two buffaloes while fighting them and then i will assume that you are the king
 raja ko samaj nahin aayaa ki inhen kaise chhudaaya jaae
 Eventually Kalinga separated them
 raaj hairaan the or itane prabhavit ki unase shaadi kaa man bana liya
 The Panchadevs got the king to marry Kalinga
 jab baaki raniyon ne use dekha to sabhi dwesh karne lageen
 Then one day she became pregnant
 saaton se yah bardaasht kar paanaa mushkil tha or uske garbh ko khatm karne kii yojana banaai
 Scared the Kalinga that an astrologer has said that it is not good to see your child as soon as you are born
 isliye prasav ke dauraan sauton ne uske aakhon par kaali pattee baandh di
 When Kalinga was born, she was thrown into the cowshed, so that the cows were buried under her feet, and Kalinga was told that she gave birth to the stone
 udhar goshaale main bachche ko kharoch tak nahin ai or gaayon ne us bachche ko apana doodh pilaakar jinda rakhaa
 Then it was put into a scorpion-filled hay field, pressed into a heap of salt, but it turned into a heap of sugar
 aakhirkaar lohe ke sanduk main bachche ko daalkar kaali nadi main baha diya
 After seven days and seven nights, he reached Sanduk Gauri Ghat
 jahaan bhaana naamak machuaare ke jaal main vah funs gaya
 He and his wife saw the child, then there was a glow of happiness in his eyes, because they too had no children
 dhire-dhire bachche ke andar adbhut shaktiyaan viksit hone lageen
 One day the child saw in his dream that his mother Kalinga is crying and crying saying that you are my son
 aajaa mere paas bete auki isi ke saath janm kii sari ghatnaayen swapn ke jariye dikhaai de gai
 One day that child told his father that i want a horse
 garib machuaare ke paas ghoda kahaan se kharid paata, isliye usne badhai se kaath kaa ghod banavaakar bachche ko de diya
 The child, with his miraculous power, laid down his life in that horse
 ek din vah raja jhalurai kii rajdhani dhoomakot panhucha, vahaan ek talab ke paas pahunchakar apane ghode ko baandh kar aaraam karne laga
 Seven queens were talking near the same reservoir about how Rani had tried to kill her child by conspiring with Kalinga, and they had betrayed Kalinga by showing him a blood-clad silbatta
 kuch der baad vah apane ghode ko jalashay ke paas le gaya or raniyon ko usne kinare hatane ko kaha or kehane laga ki mere ghode ko pani pinaa he
 She started laughing at his words and started saying that you are stupid
 kaath kaa ghoda bhi bhala pani pi saktaa he? jawaab main bachche ne kaha agar koi stri silbatte ko janm de sakati he to kaath kaa ghoda pani kyon nahin pi saktaa? yah sunakar sabhi raniyaan hairaan thim or raja ke paas jaakar us bachche kii shikaayatein karne lageen
 The child was kidnapped by soldiers and brought before the king
 raja ne poocha yah kya bevakoofi he
 How can a wooden horse drink water? The child replied - Maharaj, in the kingdom of which a woman can give birth to a silbatta, this horse of wood can also drink water
 tab us bachche ne raja ko apane janm kii ghatnaon kaa varnan kiya or kaha ki meri maa kalinga ke saath ghor anyaay hua he or aap bhi thage gaye hai
 Angry with rage, the king put the seven queens in captivity
 tab saaton raniyaan pashchaatap karte hue kalinga se maafee maangane lageen
 Then the child understood his father and requested him to forgive him
 ant main raja ne unhen daasiyon ke samaan jivan gujaarne ke liye chhod diya
 This child grew up and became famous under the names Grewal, Golju, Bala Goria Gaur Bhairav golu etc

 citen, aavak or jaavak trephic par nazar rakhti hai taaki yah pataa rahe ki unki site ke koun se prishth lokapriy hai yaa kya koi spasht rujhaan dikh rahaa he, jaise ki kisi vishesh desh main kisi vishesh prishth ko dekha ja rahaa he
 There are many ways to track this traffic and the data collected is used to structure the site, highlight security problems or indicate a possible lack of bandwidth - not all web traffic is welcome
 vardhit web trephic ke badale, kuch companiyaan vigyaapan yojanaon kii peshkash karti hai, jiske tahat site kii screen par sthaan ke liye bhugtan kiya jaataa he
