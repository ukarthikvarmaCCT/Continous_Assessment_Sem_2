 Jagdish Chandra Basu was a famous scientist of India who had deep knowledge of Physics, Biology, Botany and Archeology
 ve pehle vaigyanik the jinhone radio or sookshm tarangon kii prakaashiki par kaary kiya
 He made many important discoveries in botany
 saath hi ve bharat ke pehle vaigyanik shodhakartta the
 He was the first scientist from India to receive an American patent
 unhen radio vigyaan kaa pita mana jaataa he
 He also wrote science stories and is considered the father of Bengali science fiction
 british bharat ke bengal praant main janme basu ne saint zavier mahavidhyalay, kalakatta se snaatak kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 He then went to London for medical education, but due to health problems he had to leave this education in the middle and return to India
 inhone phir presidency mahavidhyalay main bhautikee ke praadhyaapak kaa pad sambhala or jatigat bhedbhaav kaa saamana karte hue bhi bahut se mahatvapurn vaigyanik prayog kiye
 He made extraordinary progress in sending wireless signals and first started using semiconductors to capture radio messages
 lekin apni khojon se vyavsaayik laabh uthaane kii jagah inhone inhen saarvajanik rup se prakashit kar diya taaki anya shodhakartta inpar aage kaam kar saken
 After this, he made many discoveries in botany
 inhone ek yantra crescograph kaa avishkaar kiya or isse vibhinn uttejkon ke prati paudhon kii pratikriya kaa adhyayan kiya
 In this way, they proved that there is a lot of similarity between flora and animal tissues
 ye patent prakriya ke bahut viruddh the or mitron ke kehane par hi inhone ek patent ke liye aavedan kiya
 In recent years, their contributions to modern science are again being recognized
 basu kaa janm 30 navambar 1858 ko bengal main dhaka jile ke faridpur ke memansingh main hua tha
 His father Lord Chandra Basu was a leader of the Brahmo Samaj and was a sub-magistrate or Assistant Commissioner in Faridpur, Bardhaman and elsewhere
 inkaa parivaar raarikhal gaanv, bikrampur se aayaa tha, jo aajkal bangladesh ke munshiganj jile main he
 By the age of eleven, he was educated in a school in the village
 basu kii shiksha ek bangla vidhyalay main prarambh hui
 His father believed that his mother tongue should be well versed before learning English
 vikrampur main 1915 main ek sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue basu ne kaha- "us samay par bacchon ko angreji vidyalayon main bhejnaa haisiyat kii nishaani mana jaataa tha
 In the Bengali school i was sent to, i used to sit on my right side, the son of my father's Muslim attendant and on my left the son of a fisherman
 ye hi mere khel ke saathi bhi the
 i listened to their stories of birds, animals and aquatic animals
 shaayad inhen kahaniyon ne mere mastishk main prakruti kii sanrachana par anusandhan karne kii gahari ruchi jagaai
 "after schooling, he moved to Calcutta and joined St
 Xavier's School
 jagadish chandra bose kii jeev vigyaan main bahut ruchi thi or 22 varsh kii aayu main chikitsa vigyaan kii padhai karne ke liye landan chale gaye
 But due to poor health, he gave up the idea of becoming a doctor and went to Christ's College, Cambridge, and there, a famous professor of physics, Father Lafont, inspired Bose to study physics
 varsh 1885 main ye swadesh laute tathaa bhautikee ke sahaayak praadhyaapak ke rup main presidency college main padhaane lage
 Here he stayed until 1915
 us samay bhartiya shikshakon ko angrej shikshakon kii tulana main ek tihaai vetan diya jaataa tha
 This was opposed by Jagdish Chandra Bose and continued to work for three years without pay, due to which his condition deteriorated and he was severely indebted
 is karj ko chukaane ke liye unhen apni pushtaini jameen bhi bechni padi
 Jagdish Chandra Bose won the fourth year and was given full salary
 bose ek achche shikshak bhi the, jo kaksha main padhaane ke liye bade paimaane par vaigyanik pradarshnon kaa upyog karte the
 Some students of Bose like Satendra Nath Bose later became famous physicists
 british saidhantik bhautik vigyaani james clerk maxwell ne ganitiya rup se vividh tarang dairdhya kii vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi, par unki bhavishyavaanee ke satyaapan se pehle 1879 main nidhan unka ho gaya
 British physicist Oliver Lodge demonstrated the existence of Maxwell waves by transmitting them with stars in 1887–88
 german bhautikashastri henrik hertz ne 1888 main mukt antariksh main vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv ko prayog karke dikhaaya
 Subsequently, Lodge continued Hertz's work and gave a memorable lecture in June 1894 and published it in book form
 loj ke kaam ne bharat ke bose sahit vibhinn deshon ke vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 The first notable aspect of Bose's microwave research was that he brought the wavelength to the millimeter level
 ve prakaash ke gunon ke adhyayan ke liye lambii tarang dairdhya kii prakaash tarangon ke nuksaan ko samaj gaye
 In 1893, Nikola Tesla performed the first public radio communications
 ek saal baad, kolkata main navambar 1894 ke ek saarvajanik pradarshan dauraan, bose ne ek millimetre range microwave tarang kaa upyog barood duuri par prajvalit karne or ghanti bajaane main kiya
 Lieutenant Governor Sir William mckenzie witnessed Bose's performance at the Calcutta Town Hall
 bose ne ek bengali niabandh, 'adrishy alok' main likhaa tha, "adrishy prakaash aasaani se eent kii deevaaron, bhawanon aadi ke bheetar se ja sakati he, isliye taar kii bina prakaash ke madhyam se sandesh sanchaarit ho saktaa he
 "popov did one such experiment in Russia
 bose k "dabl apvartak crystal dwaara bijli kii kirnon ke dhruvikaran par" pehla vaigyanik lekh, loj lekh ke ek saal ke bheetar, may 1895 main bengal kii aciatic socity ko bheja gaya tha
 His second article was sent to Lord Royal in London in October 1895 by Lord Rayleigh
 disambar 1895 main, landan patrika electrician ne bose kaa lekh "ek nae electro-polariscope par" prakashit kiya
 At that time the term 'coherer' coined by Lodge in the English-speaking world was used for Hertz's wave receiver or detector
 electrician ne tatkaal bose ke 'kohirar' par tippanee kii
 
 The commentary quoted from the English magazine Electrician is: bose "apane kohirar" ko behtar karne kii yojana banaai lekin yah patent ke bare main kabhi nahin sochaa
 Bose conducted his experiments at a time when radio was developing as a contact medium
 radio microwave optics par bose ne jo kaam kiya tha wo radio communication se judaa hua nahin tha, lekin unke dwaara kiye hue sudhaar evam unke dwaara is vishay main likhe hue tathyon ne duusare radio avishkaarakon ko zarur prabhavit kiya tha
 In the late 1894 era, Guglielmo Marconi was working on a radio system that was being designed specifically for wireless telegraphy
 1896 ke aarambh tak yah pranali physics dwaara bataaye gaye range se zyaada duri main radio signlles transmit kar rahi thi
 Jagadish Chandra Bose was the first scientist to find out what the semiconductor junction was used to detect radio waves and discovered many microwave components in this method
 iske baad agle 50 saal tak millimetre lambaai kii electromagnetic tarango par koi shodh kaary nahin hua tha
 In 1897, Bose described his research on millimeter waves at the Royal Institution in London
 unhone apane shodh main vevagids, horn antena, daai -electric lens ,alag alag posraiser or semiconductor jinaki frequency 60 ghz tak thi -- unka istemaal kiya tha
 All these devices are still present at Bose Institute, Kolkata
 ek 1
3 mm multibeam resiver jo kii erizona ke NRAO 12 meter telescope main hai, acharya bose 1897 main likhe hue research paper ke siddhanto par banaaya gaya hai
 Sir Neville Mott received the Nobel Prize in 1977 for his research work in Solid State Electronics
 unhone yah kaha tha kii acharya jagadish chandra bose apane samay se 60 saal aage the
 In fact, it was Bose who predicted the existence of P-type and N-type semiconductors
 biophysics ke kshetra main unka sabase bada yogadan yah tha kii unhone apan dikhaaya kii paudho main uttejnaa kaa sanchaar vaidyuthik madhyam se hota hai naa kii chemical madhyam se
 These claims were later proven to be true through scientific proyogo
 acharya bose ne sabase pehle microwave ke vanaspati ke tishyu par hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 He studied the effect of changing weather on plants
 iske saath saath unhone rasinic inhibitors kaa paudhon par asar or badalte hue taapmaana se hone vaale paudhon par asar kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 By analyzing changes in cell membrane potential under different conditions, they came to the conclusion that plants are sensitive "they can feel pain, feel affection, etc
"
 bose ne alag alag dhaatu or paudhon ke tishyu par fatig rispance kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya tha
 He stimulated different metals by mixing electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal methods and noted the similarities of the cell and metal reaction
 bose ke prayogo ne simulated koshikao or dhaatu main chakree fatig pratikriya dikhaai thi
 Along with this, special cyclic fatigues and recovery responses were also studied for different stimuli in living cells and metals
 acharya bose ne badalte hue electrical stimuli ke saath paudhon badalte hue electrical pratikriya kaa ek graph banaaya, or yah bhi dikhaaya kii jab paudhon ko zehar yaa anaesthetic di jaati hai tab unki pratikriya kaam hone lagati hai or aage chalakar shunaya ho jaati hai
 But zinc metal did not show this reaction when it was treated with oxalic acid
 1917 main jagadish chandra bose ko "nite" kii oopaadhi pradaan kii gai tathaa sheeghra hi bhautik tathaa jeev vigyaan ke liye royal sosayadi landan ke faillo chun liye gaye
 Bose had done all his research without any good equipment and laboratory, so Jagdish Chandra Bose was thinking of making a good laboratory
 "bose institute" isi soch kaa parinaam he joki vigyaan main shodhakarya ke liye raashtra kaa ek prasiddh kendra he
 Yashwantrao Balwantrao Chavan was the first Chief Minister of Maharashtra and the fifth Deputy Prime Minister of India after the bifurcation of the state of Mumbai
 ve ek majboot congress netaa, swatantraaa senaanee, sahakaari netaa, saamaajik kaaryakarta or lekhak the
 He was known as the leader of the common people
 unhone apane bhaashanon or lekhon main dridhtaa se samaajawaadee loktantr kii vakaalat kii or maharashtra main kisaanon kii behatari ke liye sahakaari samitiyon ko sthapit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 This great leader was born on 12 March 1913 to a Maratha peasant family in a village called Devarashtre in Satara district of Maharashtra state, India
 bachapan main unhone apane pita ko kho diya or unka paalan-poshan unke chachaa tathaa maa dwaara kiya gaya
 His mother taught him valuable lessons of self-reliance and patriotism
 Right from his childhood he was influenced by the freedom struggle of India

 Daksha and Gandharva have been virtually luxuriant castes

 It is a major human settlement pattern, often seen in rural areas
 shunagashep aitarey brahman main sthit ek aakhyaan he
 The gist of it is that until death comes, conversion does not happen
 yah aakhyaan maanviya lobh, beimaani or usase upar uthne kii kshamta kii katha he
 King Harishchandra was childless despite his hundred queens
 usne varun devtaa kii upasna kii ki agar mujhe putr prapti ho to pehla putr aapako samarpit karuunga
 He had a son, named Rohit
 lekin raja ne jaise hi putr ko sadeh dekha, uski niyat main khot aa gaya
 He kept avoiding talking of handing Rohit to Varuna Deity on some pretext
 pita kahin use sachmuch varun dev ko nahin arpit kar den, is dar se rohit jangal main bhaag gaya or harishchandr ne apana pran puraa nahin kiya, isliye varun ne use shaap de diya or vah biimaar ho gaya
 Luckily roaming around in the forest, Rohit brought a woman named Azigart to a poor Brahmin
 usase rohit ne apni kahani kahi
 Azigart had three sons - Shun: Pucha, Shun: Langul and Shun: Shep
 shun:shape manjhala putr tha or bachapan se hi bahut samajhadaar or vivekwan tha
 Azigart greedily tells Rohit that he is ready to sell one of his sons in exchange for a hundred cows
 us putr ko vah apane badale varun devtaa ko saunp kar apni jaan bachaa saktaa he
 Shun on the other hand: Shep thought, younger brother is mother's dear, elder brother is father's dear, if i go away, neither of them will have any regret
 isliye vah khud hi rohit ke saath jane ko taiyaar ho gaya
 Varun Dev was also no less greedy
 ve yah soch kar prasann ho gaye ki mujhe apane anushthan ke liye kshatriya balak ke badale brahman balak mil rahaa he jo shreshthatar he
 In the yajna, preparations for the male sacrifice began, four priests were called
 ab shun:shape ko bali stambh se baandhna tha
 But none of those four prepared for this, because Shun: Shep was a Brahmin
 tab ajigart or sau gaayon ke badale khud hi apane bachche ko yajna stambh se baandhne ko taiyaar ho gaya
 After this it was the turn to sacrifice Shun: Shep
 lekin purohiton ne phir manaa kar diya
 Who should kill a Brahmin? Then Azigart and also agreed to cut his son in exchange for one hundred cows
 jab shun:shape ne dekha ki ab mujhe bachaane vaala koi nahin he, to usne usha devtaa kaa stvan shuru kiya
 With each Richa, each bond of Shun: Shep broke, and with the last Richa, not only Shun: Shape was freed, but King Harishchanda also became cursed
 isi ke saath balak shun:shape, rishi shun:shape ban gaya, kyonki vah uske liye roopantaran kii ghadi thi
 According to some other scholars, Shun: The great ascetic born in the clan of Shep Kaushiko and the daughter of Vishwamitra's enemy Shambar was the lost child of Ugra, which Lopamudra hid near Ajitgarta due to fear of Bharato
 bharto ne ugr ko maar diya
 The mind and life of any human born in the Indian culture remains tied to the three quarters
 yah ek nirvivaad hakeekat he
 These three names are named - 1
 Putraksha, 2
 Finance and 3
 Lokaixa
 in teenon main se jo vitaishna he, vah manushya-jivan ke vyaavhaarik jivan se naata rakhti he
 And the Lokaैाaाa, it is related to the post mortal world, the heavens, which are derived from the Yāmāyāgadi, the pre-eminence
 parantu jo putraishna he, vah manushyamaatr kii pruthivilok par sadaiv bane rahane kii shaashvat evam saarvbhaum ichha kaa akatya ankur he
 And in such a daughter-in-law, both son and daughter are desired - this thing is logically implied
 lekin strideh kii prakritik maryaadaaon ke kaaran, strideh kii apeksha purushadeh sabal hone ke kaaran samaaj main purush kaa mahatva badhata gaya he or vishwa main bahushah samaaj purushpradhan aakaarit hota rahaa he
 Therefore, son-in-law has become enlightened in the mind of man
 atah aitareibrahman main aayi hui shunagashep kii jo katha he vah putraishna-grast janamanas ko ativ suchak rup se maardarshak banati he
 
 yadhyapi shunagashep kii katha ko adyavadhi duusare hi pariprekshya main dekhi jaati he
 Such as - whether there were malevolent yagas during Vedas
 shunamshepakhyaan main varunadevataa ko koi manushya kaa bali chadhaane kii baat aati he, is liye duniya bhar ke vidwaanon ne ek hi baat ko charchaa kaa bindu banaaya he ki vaidic yajna-yagadi main pashubali ke saath saath manushyon kaa bhi bali chadhaaya jaataa tha ki nahin
 - But in this narrative no human sacrifice is ultimately offered
 is ke kaaran punarvichaar kii nitant aavashyaktaa he
 In the beginning of this Shunashekayakhana, King Harishchandraji has asked Narada that - both wise and ignorant people wish for their sons
 to mujhe yah bataao ki putr kii kaamana kyon kerani chaiye ? is jigyaasa kaa samaadhaan dete huye naradji ne kaha ki putr to param vyom main bhi jyoti-swaroop hota he
 On the other hand, at the end of this narrative, it is said that this story should be recited in the context of the coronation of any king, and whoever wishes a son, these people should also listen to this narrative
 shunagashep aakhyaan ke is upkram evam upsanhaar ko dhyaan main rakhte huye yadi dekha jaay to is aakhyaan main teen putron evam teen pitaaon kii katha prastut hui he
 As it is the case of the first father: - Harishchandra, the king of Ikshvaku dynasty, was ineligible even though he was a wife
 parantu in shat-sankhyak vivaahon ke peeche nishchit rup se, chaalak parible ke rup main putraishna hi rahi hogi
 Narada has explained in detail the benefits that come from having a son
 usko sun kar harishchandr varunadevataa se kisi bhi kimmat par putr kii yachana karata he
 Once a son is born and if he faces it, then he will be grateful
 or uske baad vah varun ko putr kii bali chadhaane ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Harishchandra got a son on this condition
 yahan prastut aakhyaan kii katha se malum hota he ki manushyamaatr main jo putraishna he, vah aadmi ko kadachi andhshraddha main duubo detii he
 a son is obtained by sacrificing to the gods - to believe it is an ignorance
 duusare str par yahan dekha jaataa he ki putr-prapti ke baad pita harishchandr mohandh bhi ho jate he or varun ko balidaan dene ke vaada se baar baar peeche hath karte rahete he
 Whenever Varun Dev comes to ask for sacrifice, then he keeps on pretending to give sacrifice to his son, showing one excuse after another
 jo doosraa pita he vah suyavas kaa putr ajigart he
 The poor person is suffering from hunger
 uske paas ashrith ke rup main unki patni or teen putr bhi he
 Being sold in an extraordinary and unavoidable crisis of hunger, he sells any of his sons in the market is not fair
 atah vah kutumb ke dhurin hone ke naate swayan hi bik jaay to vahi thik mana jaayegaa
 But "everyone loves their own soul more than all" - If this cruel truth is taken into consideration and thought again, the possibility of selling one of the three sons may be tolerable
 isi tarah se, mata-pita kii yugon puraani ek nirbalata bhi kubul kii jaay kii pita ko jyeshthaputra hi priy hota he or mata ko kanishthputra hi adhik priy hota he
 So the poor 'ascetic' Madhyamaputra definitely becomes the goat of sacrifice in such an odd situation
 is tarah, kshudharth pita ajigart raja harishchandr se so gaayon ko le kar, uske badale main ek putr ko bech de to vah kadachit – haan kadachit hi – anichhaa se nyaayik bataaya ja saktaa he
 But if the same father is ready to tie his son as a sacrificial animal, in the sacrificial fire of Harishchandra and ask for other cows for such a cruel act, then it will be said to be the result of greed
 aakhyaankar mahidas aitarey ne lobh kii paraakaashtha bhi bataayi he
 Father Azigart does not relent with his sinful act after tying up son Shunshape with Yup
 yajna main shunagashep kaa bali ke rup main jab tak koi vadh nahin karegaa, tab tak yajna puraa nahin hoga
 None of the chandals from the village is willing to come and kill a man
 atah shunagashep kaa pita ajigart lobhavshaat is paapakarm ke liye taiyaar hota he
 He asked for the third sleeping cows
 tathaa nirdayata-purvak apane hi putr kaa vadh karne ke liye nangi talwaar lekar uth chalata he
 - This picture reveals the iniquity of a greedy father
 darshanashastron main jo shad ripu ke rup main ginaye gayi he – kaam, krodh, mad, moh, lobh or matsar – unamem se uttarottar ripu kaa balwattar hona mana gaya he
 That is, Ripu named fifth greed is more powerful than the first Kamadi four ripu
 is drushti se dekha jaay to duusare prakaar ke pita ne lobhagrast hokar, keval pitrumaryada kaa hi bhang nahin kiya he
 But, by encroaching human dignity, he has gone far to the sinful path
 tisare pita ke rup main rishi vishwamitra he, jinke ek-so ek putr the
 In his leadership, it was certain to sacrifice Shunashep in a yajna
 unhone apane sammukh dayaneey dasha main bandhe hue shunagashep ko yagyeey-pashu ke rup main dekha he
 His pathetic pity and helplessness have also been seen every moment
 or vikat paristhiti main devon kii upasna kaa maarg pakadnevaala, swayan hi apana uddharak banakar mrityu-pash main se chhutne kaa prayaas karanevaala dhairyavan shunagashep unhon ne baariki se dekha he
 Prajapati, Agni, Savita, Varuna, Vishwadeva, Ashvinau, Indra and Usha - all Vedic deities are shown by Shunashep respectively from their mantras
 unase baatcheet bhi karata he
 Who would not like such a true Brahminputra sage? rishi vishwamitra ne aise shunagashep ko hi apni viraasat – gyanrashi – ko sambhalanevaala samajha
 or man hi man shunagashep ko apane putr ke rup main usko sweekaar liya
 Vishwamitra was a man of merit as a father
 unhon ne apane pratham pachaas putron ko bulaayen or shunagashep ko jyeshtha-bandhu ke rup main swikaarne ko kaha
 But those sons did not obey the ancestral order
 atah vishwamitra ne un pachaason ko ‘ aputra ’ jaahir kar diye
 They were deprived of the right portion of sage wealth
 is ke baad, jo madhuchhnda naamak ikyanavaan putr tha or unke jo sabhi anuj the, unhon ne shunagashep ko apana jyeshtha bhrata maan liya
 Vishwamitra Rishi then proclaimed Shunasha Shep as "devrat"
 putraishna rakhanevaale manushyon ko chaiye ki ve pehele vishwamitra jaise gungnata pita bane
 Vishwamitra liked this mantradashtha Shunsha Shep as the best son, and accepted him as his son, as expected of his centuries - this is a big indicator
 yadi aisa putr mila ho to hi naarad ne jo kaha tha ki – “ putr param vyom main bhi jyoti hota he, ”- vah charitaarth ho saktaa he, anyathaa nahin
 In this narrative it is necessary to compare the three fathers like King Harishchandra, the impoverished Azigart and the sage Vishwamitra, in the same way it is worth comparing the three types of sons as well
 jaisaa ki – pahela he raja harishchandr kaa putr rohit
 He opposes his father's proposal and, after rejecting the paternal order, commits homicide to protect the life and wanders in the forest
 is ke baad pita ko jalodar naamak rog hua he – aisa sun kar, pitruvatsalya se prerit ho kar vah ghar waapas aane kaa nirnay karata he
 But on the way Indradev is found, comes in his words and he comes again and again in the direction of others and returns to the forest
 in shabdon se indra ne jo upadesh diya tha, iskaa fal yah aata he ki harishchandr ke putr rohit ko van-vicharan ke dauraan, teen putron ko saath main lekar ann kii talash main ghum rahe ek daridr pita ajigart mil gaya
 Being a Rajput, Rohit comes back to the palace on the insistence of Rajalakshmi, that is, on the insistence of father-earning, buying a poor and inferior son of a poor person
 rajkumaar rohit ne man main aisa soch rakhaa he ki is daridr-brahmanputra kaa bali de kar, varun ke pash se pita ko vah mukt kara legaa or apane aap ko bhi maut se mukti mil jaayegi
 Here, Rohit, who has been repeatedly wandering in the place of Indra, is introduced to Rohit, first as a son with an indecisive morale and later, as a Rajput son taking shelter of selfish and father-earning
 sansar main yah pehele prakaar kaa putr he
 
 sansar main jo duusare prakaar kaa putr hota he, vah rishi vishwamitra ke agraj 50 putron hai
 They do not obey even a mantra father like Vishwamitra
 pita kii vivekbuddhi kii avhelnaa karanevaale in putron ne paitruk-viraasat kho di or shaapit bhi huye
 As a result, they start living like dacoits in society
 ikyanavaan madhuchhnda naamak putr or unke anuj 50 bhratri-samooh ne pita kii ajna maan lee
 These sons, who believed in Vishwamitra's eyes, accepted Shunha Sheep as their eldest brother
 
 The third type of son who is always palpable is Shunhashep
 puure aakhyaan ko padh kar lagata he ki vah kshudha-peedit vyakti jarur tha, parantu nity vidya-vyasang karne vaala putr tha
 Because he was well aware of the mantras that have come in the fourth and fourth divisions of the Rigveda to get rid of Varuna's loop
 saath main vah swayan bhi, pratham mandal main sangruhit anek mantron kaa drashtaa rishi bhi he
 Hence, he becomes an intelligent son in the eyes of sage Vishwamitra
 vishwamitra ko apane hi 101 orasaputra the
 But he regretted not having a mantra-seer son like Shunha Shep
 atah vah apane orasputron ko bula ke shunagashep ko jyeshtha-bandhu ke rup main swikaarne kii ajna detaa he
 According to him, only a son like Shun Shashep is collectible and palatable
 vishwamitra ne puri yajyakriya ke dauraan dekha he ki shunagashep sahi arth main devraat he
 Gods like Agni, Varuna, Indra, Ashvinau, Vishwadeva and Usha were his property - Rati - and on that he has achieved his salvation
 yahan par, shunagashep vidya-vyasangi hone ke kaaran amuk mantra jaanata he yaa naye mantra dekh saktaa he – itnaa hi kahana paryaapt nahin he
 He has even told his father's sin on his face
 arthath shunagashep satya kaa aparoksh darshan bhi kar saktaa he or pita ke sammukh khada rahe kar vah bataa bhi saktaa he
 That is his greatness
 aise satya ko bolne vaale ko hi varun pash se mukt karata he, duusare ko nahin
 Because Varuna is said to be the fettle god of the policy and the master of the ritual
 atah vah satyaniti ke drashtaa shunagashep ko bandhan se mukt kar detaa he
 Only such a son of truth can become a form of light for the fathers in the Supreme Vyom
 or aise putr kii hi kaamana rakhni chaiye
 That is, the son should also be controlled with discretion
 is tarah se shunamshepakhyaan kaa marmoddhatan ho jane ke baad, is aakhyaan kaa upsanhaar bhi turant samaj main aa jaataa he ki - 1
 kisi bhi raja ke abhishek-prasang main is aakhyaan kaa paath karwaane kii soochna kyun di gai he ?
 It is unfair to be blinded to get an heir to the state
 2
 tathaev, putr kii ichha rakhanevaalon ko bhi is aakhyaan kaa pathshravan karnaa chaiye – aisa jo upsanhaar main kaha gaya he vah bhi purvokt teen tarah ke putron ko thik se samaj lene ke liye hi he
 
 yahan aanushanbik rup se yah bataanaa bhi jaruri he ki is aakhyaan ke upakrmopsanhaar ko dekhte hue - “ vedakaal main narbali diya jaataa tha ki nahin ? ” jaisi charchaayen saare sansar main azdin tak hoti rahi he, parantu vah charchaa bhrantadisha main chal rahi he – aisa pratiti hota he
 Now, if seen from the innovative point of view, then the message of Shunshape to this world suffering from sexual harassment is that the opportunity has come to get rid of female murders
 koi bhi putree maatpita ko narak main nahin le jaati he or sab ke sab putr param vyom main le janevaali sachhee jyoti nahin ban sakate he

 When a Red Mahadanava becomes a Blue Mahadanava, the blinding blue of the Blue Mahadanva collides with the slow thunderstorm of the old Red Mahadanava and a gas convection forms a finer circle around the star

 He is also known as Bukk Rai I
 bukk ne telugu kavi naachan soma ko sangrakshan diya
 The Vijayanagara kingdom was established on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in South India in the first half of the 14th century, the name of its founder Bukk and its eldest brother Harihar is famous in history
 sangam naamak vyakti ke paanch putron main inhen donon kii pradhanta thi
 In early life, the ruler of Warangal was an officer under Prataparudra II
 uttar bharat se akramanakari musalamaani sena ne warangal par chadhaai kii, at: donon bhrata kampili chale gaye
 In 1327 AD, Bukk captive was sent to Delhi and became a confidant of the Delhi Sultan if he accepted the religion of Islam

 In 1357 AD, the Vijayanagara kingdom came to the hands of Bukk after he was declared the successor by the elder brother

 His dominion over the territory was greater than the former ruler

 During his reign Bukk i also sent ambassadors to the country of China which was a memorable event
 anek gunon se yukt hone ke kaaran madhavacharya ne jaimini nyaayamala main bukk kii nimna prashansa kii he: The early life of Bukka and his brother Haqq is almost unknown and much of the description of his early life is based on various opinions
 ek mat ke anusaar bukk or hakk kaa janm kuruba jati main hua tha or ve warangal ke raja kii sena ke senapati the
 After the defeat of the King of Warangal at the hands of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, Bukk and his brother were taken captive and sent to Delhi
 donon ko jabaran islam main dharmantarit kiya gaya
 Bukk and his brothers eventually managed to escape from there and re-adopted their Hindu traditions and established the Vijayanagara Empire under the guidance of the Brahmin saint Vidyaranya

 kanhopatra ek 15 veen sadi ke marathi sant-kavyatri thi
 Was revered by the Varkari sect of Hinduism
 sabase paaramparik ke anusaar, kanhopatra ek veshya or naachne lashaki thi
 She believed in the Varkari religion
 vah bidar ke badshaah kii upapatni se bina varkari ke hindu bhagwaan vithoba-devtaa sangrakshak ko aatmasamarpan karne ke liye chunaae
 He died in the main temple of Vithoba in Pandharpur
 sirf unho ek hi vyakti kiske samadhi mandir ke parisar ke bheetar he
 Kanhopatra used to write a poem about her devotion to Vithoba and her struggle to balance her modesty with her Marathi Ovi and Abhanga
 unki kavitaaon main, bhagwaan vithoba uske rakshak banate the or apane peshey ke changul se use reeha karne ke liye prarthana kar rahi thi
 His thirty unicorns have survived even today and people still sing
 vah sirf ek hi mahila sant varkari,jinhone pavitrataa keval unki bhakthi ke aadhaar guru bina praapt kiye he
 The history of Kanhopatra has been known through the centuries for people that their stories have been passed down and their stories have become difficult to find fact and fiction
 uske janm ke bare main shamaa kar ke log maanate he or uski mouth vithoba mandir jab bidar ke badshaah ne usko chaah
 However, the characters of Sadashiv Malgujar and Hausa Maid do not appear in their characterizations
 kanhopatra ek amir veshya shamaa ki bethi thi, jo pangarpur ke mangalved shehar me rahete the
 Apart from Kanhopatra, Mangalveda saints Varkari Chokhamela and Damaji were also unsure of the identity of Shama Kanhopatra's father, but it was suspected that the head man of the city is Sadashiv Malgujar's birthplace
 kanhopatra uski maan ke mahalanuma ghar main uske bachapan bitaayaa thi or kai naukaraaniyon dwaara seva karaate the
 The social status of Kanhopatra was very low
 kanhopatra bachapan se hi nrity or geet main prashikshit kiya gaya tha taaki vah apni maan ke peshey main shaamil hone saki
 He became a talented dancer and singer
 uski sundarataa apsara menka se tulana karte the
 Shama suggested to Kanhopatra that the king should meet, then his beauty and gifts to him would be worshiped by money and jewels but Kanhopatra flatly refused
 kanhopatra kii maa shaama ne kanhopatra ko shaadi karwaane ke liye sochaa tha
 The scholar Tara Bhavalakar has been told that Kanhopatra's marriage was forbidden because she is a slave
 kanhopatra ko veshya ke jivan me aashaa nahi thi lekin uske liye ghruna kiye the or bhi log kehete hey ki vah veshya banane ke liye majbooti se manaa ki thi
 Some writers believe that she may have also worked as a prostitute
 sadashiv malguzar, kanhopatra kii apeksha kii pita, kanhopatra kii sundarataa ke bare main suna he or uske nrity ko dekhne ke liye kaamana kii, lekin kanhopatra se inkaar kar diya
 Accordingly, Sadasiva started harassing Kanhopatra and Shama
 shamaa use samajha diya he ki vah kanhopatra kaa pita tha or is tarah unhen chhod dena chahie kii koshish kii, lekin sadashiv use vishwaas nahin kiya
 As he continued his persecution, Shama's wealth gradually ran out
 aakhirkaar, shamaa sadashiv ke liye maafee maangi or use karne ke liye kanhopatra pesh karne kii peshkash kii
 Kanhopatra, however, escaped to Pandharpur with the help of his aged maid Hausa disguised as a maid
 kuch kinvadantiyon main, housa varnit ke rup main ek varkari bhakthi karne ke liye kanhopatra kii yatra ke liye shrey diya
 Other accounts gave Varkari pilgrims who passed through Kanhopatra's house on their way to the Vithoba temple in Pandharpur
 ek kahani ke anusaar, udhaaharan ke liye, vah vithoba ke bare main ek guzar varkari se poocha
 Varkari said that Vithoba is "generous, intelligent, beautiful and right", her glory is beyond description and surpasses her beauty as that of Lakshmi, the goddess of beauty
 kanhopatra aage poocha ki kya vithoba ek bhakt ke rup main use sweekaar karenge kya or varkari kah ki vah kanhopatra ko sweekaar karenge
 This assurance strengthened his resolve to go to Pandharpur
 kanhopatra turant varkari tirthayatriyon ke saath vithoba-ke bhajan pangarpur-gayan ke liye chhod detaa he yaa pangarpur uske saath uski maan ko bhi samajhakar jati thi
 When Kanhopatra has seen the Vithoba image of Pahli Bar Pandharpur, he started singing the Abhangas
 vah ek abhanga main gaayi thi ki use aadhyatmik yogyata puri kii thi or vah vithoba ke pairon dekha he ke liye aashirwad diya tha
 The unique beauty she found in Vithoba was her groom's demand
 vah bhagwaan se "vivaahit" khud ko mana or pangarpur main bas gaye
 He withdrew from society
 kanhopatra hausa ke saath pangarpur main ek jhopadi main le jaaya gaya or ek tapasvi kaa jivan jiya
 She sang and danced in the Vithoba temple, and cleaned it twice a day
 vah logon ke sambandh main praapt kii,or log maanate the ki vah ek kisaan ki bethi thi
 On this period, Kanhopatra composed Ovi poems dedicated to Vithoba
 is avadhi par sadashiv badshaah se madad maanga
 Hearing tales of Kanhopatra's beauty, the king ordered her to become his mistress
 jab usne manaa kar diya, raja bal dwaara use paane ke liye apane aadamiyon ko bheja tha
 Kanhopatra took refuge in the Vithoba temple
 raja ke sainikon mandir ko gher liya or ise nasht karne ke liye agar kanhopatra unhen saunp diya gaya tha nahin kii dhamkee di
 Requested a previous meeting with Vithoba before being taken to Kanhopatra
 sabhi isaab ke dwaara, kanhopatra to vithoba chhavi ke pair main nidhan ho gaya, lekin halaat spasht nahin the
 According to popular tradition, Kanhopatra merged with Vithoba's image in a form of waiting for marriage — something Kanhopatra
 anya siddhanton kaa suzav he ki vah khud ko maar daalaa he, yaa ki vah uski nirankushta ke liye maar daalaa gaya tha
 majority of
 isaab kehete he ki kanhopatra ke sharir vithoba ke charnon main rakhi gai thi or uske baad mandir ke dakshini bhaag ke paas dafnaaya gaya tha
 According to all versions of the legend, a Tarti tree — worshiped by its pilgrims — arose on the spot where Kanhopatra was buried
 kanhopatra keval ek hi vyakti jiskaa samadhi vithoba mandir ke parisar main he
 Many historians have tried to establish the date of life and death of Kanhopatra
 ek anumaan uski bidar ke bahamani ek raja, jo aksar kanhopatra kahani haalanki zyaadaatar khaaton main, ki raja ko spasht rup se namit kabhi nahin jaataa he ke saath judaa hua he ke sambandh main se lagbhag 1428 sii uske jivan detaa he

 According to Jelliot, he was a contemporary of saint-poets Chokhamela and Namdeva
 kanhopatra kai abhanga bana he mana jaataa he, lekin sabase likhit rup main nahin the: use kaa keval tees yaa ovis aaj jivit rahete hai
 Twenty-three verses of his poems, called the gross saint-saga, are included in the compilation of Varkari saints
 in geeton main se adhikansh aatmakathaatmak hai karunaa kaa ek tatv ke saath likhaa gaya he
 His style is described by the poetic instruments as plain easy to understand, and is performed with a simplicity of expression

 Kanhopatra's Abhanga often portrays her struggle between her profession and her devotion to Vithoba as Varkari's patron deity
 vah khud ko ek mahila ko gaharaa use use uske peshey ke asahneeya bandhan se bachaane ke liye vithoba ke liye samarpit he, or nivedan karnaa ke rup main prastut karata he
 Kanhopatra speaks of his insult and his exile from society because of his profession and social stature
 nako main devaraay anta aata par mana jaataa he uske jivan-asamarth use bhagwaan se alag hone ke bare main sochaa sahan karne kii antim abhanga hone ke liye, kanhopatra uske dukh ko samaapt karne ke vithoba bhi janm detii he

 Nadir Shah Afshar was the Shah of Persia and he established Iranian sovereignty over the region after centuries
 usne apana jivan daastaa se aarambh kiya tha or faras kaa shah hi nahin bana balki usne us samay irani samrajya ke sabal shatru osmani samrajya or roosi samrajya ko irani kshetron se baahar nikaala
 He established the Afshari dynasty and its rise came at a time when the Osmani Empire was under attack from the west in Iran and the Afghans had conquered the Safawi capital Isfahan from the east
 uttar se rus bhi faras main samrajya vistaar kii yojana bana rahaa tha
 Even under this circumstance he organized his army and due to his military campaigns he is awarded titles such as Napoleon of Persia or the last great general of Asia
 wo bharat vijay ke abhiyaan par bhi niklaa tha
 After defeating the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah Alam, who was in power in Delhi, he gained immense wealth from there, including the Kohinoor diamond
 iske baad wo apaar shaktishaalee ban gaya or uskaa swasthya bhi bigadataa gaya
 In the latter part of his life he became very tyrannical
 san 1747 main uski hatya ke baad uskaa samrajya jald hi teetar-bitar ho gaya
 Nadir was born into an ordinary family in the Afshar Qalbus clan in Khorasan
 uske pita ek saadhaaran kisaan the jinaki mrityu nadir ke balykaal main hi ho gai thi
 It is said of Nadir that his mother was enslaved by the Uzbeks with him
 par nadir bhaag sakane main safal rahaa or wo ek afshaar kabeeley main shaamil ho gaya or kuch hi dinon main uske ek tabake kaa pramukh ban baitha
 He soon emerged as a successful soldier and married two daughters of Baba Ali Baig, a local headman
 nadir ek lambaa, sajila or shokh kaali aankhon vaala noujvaan tha
 He was ruthless towards his enemies but generous towards his servants and soldiers
 use ghudsawaari bahut pasand thi or ghodon kaa bahut shauk tha
 His voice was very serious and it is also considered one of the many reasons for his success
 vah ek turkmen tha or uske kabeeley ne shah ismail pratham ke samay se hi safaviyon kii bahut madad kii thi
 At that time, the throne of Persia was ruled by the Safavis
 lekin nadir shah kaa bhavishya shah ke takhtapalat ke kaaran nahin bana jo ki praayah kai safal senanayakon ke saath hota he
 He supported the Safavis
 us samay saafavi apane patanonmukh samrajya main nadir shah ko paakar bahut prasann hue
 On one side, the Osmani Empire, on the other hand, the Afghan revolt had plagued the Safavis
 iske alaava uttar se roosi samrajya bhi nigahen gadaaye baitha tha
 Shah Sultan Hussain's son Tahmasya joined Nadir
 uske saath milakar usne uttari iran main mashhad se afgaanon ko bhagaakar apane adhikaar main le liya
 Impressed by his service, he received the title of Thamasya Quli Khan
 yah ek sammaan tha kyonki isse use shahi naam mila tha
 But Nadir was not a commander to be so satisfied
 nadir ne iske baad heraat ke abdali afagaanon ko parrast kiya
 After consolidating his position in the court of Tehmashp, he planned to attack the Afghans who had captured the capital Isfahan in 1729
 is samay ek unani vyapaaree or paryatak besile vatatzes ne nadir ke sainya abhyaason ko aankhon se dekha tha
 He made a note - Nadir bowed his head in acceptance of his generals' greetings after entering the practice area
 uske baad wo apana ghoda roktaa tha or kuch der tak sena kaa nirikshan ekadam chup rahakar karata tha
 He allowed the practice to begin
 iske baad abhyaas aarambh hota tha - chakra, vyuh rachana or ghudsawaari ityadi

 nadir khud teen ghante tak ghode par abhyaas karata tha
 By the end of 1729, he defeated the Afghans three times and took Isfahan back under his control
 usne afagaanon ko mahafooj tareeke se bhaagane de diya
 He then planned a massive military campaign
 jiske liye usne shah tahmaashp ko kar vasuulne par majaboor kiya
 Usmani Turks dominated from the west
 abhi tak nadir ke abhiyaan uttari, kendriya tathaa purvi iran or usase sate afghanistan tak simit rahe the
 He drove the Osmanis from the west and soon after that he moved east towards Herat where he took control of Herat
 uski sainya safalataa tahmaashp se dekhi nahin gai
 He feared a coup
 usne apni sainya yogyata sabit karne ke makasad se osmanon ke saath phir se yuddh shuru kar diya jiskaa ant uske liye sharmnaak rahaa or use nadir dwaara jite hue kuch pradesh osmanon ko lautaane pade
 Nadir was agitated when he returned from Herat
 usne janata se apana samarthan maanga
 At the same time, one day in Isfahan, he explained to Tehmashp in a state of intoxication that he was unfit for governance and at his behest, the courtiers installed the young son of Tahamashp, Abbas
 uske rajbhishek ke samay nadir ne ghoshnaa kii ki wo kandahaar, dilli, bukhaara or istambul ke shaskaon ko haraayega
 The people present in the court felt that this was nothing but extreme self-sufficiency
 par aane vaale samay main unako pataa chalaa ki aisa nahin tha
 He prepared an army to attack the Osman in the direction of the west
 par apane pehle akraman main use paraajay mili
 Usman sent a heavy army to protect Baghdad, which Nadir could not answer
 lekin kuch maheenon ke bheetar usne sena phir se sangathit kii
 This time he defeated the Osmanis near Kirkuk
 yerawan ke paas june 1735 main usne roosiyon kii madad se osmanion ko ek baar phir se haraa diya
 Under this agreement, the Russians also withdrew from the Persian territories
 nadir ne 1736 main apane senapatiyon, prantapalon tathaa kai samarthakon ke samaksh khud ko shah ghoshit kar diya
 Shia Islam and the atrocities perpetrated by the Sunnis are of great importance in Iran's religious history
 safavi shiya the or unke tahat shiya logon ko arabon ke julm se chhutkaaraa mila tha
 Today the people of Iran are Shia and there is a tradition of abusing the first three Caliphs
 nadir shah ne apni gaddi samhaalane vakt ye shart rakhi ki log un khalifaaon ke prati yah anadar bhav chhod denge
 It also benefited him
 iran main shiya sunni tanaav to kam hua hi saath hi iran ko islam ke duusare kendra ke rup main dekha jane laga
 Nadir also had a moderate religious relationship with the Armenians
 uskaa shashan yahudiyon ko liye bhi ek sukun kaa samay tha
 Within his empire, he made no attempt to inflict Sunni religion on the people, but outside the empire he became known as the Shah of the Sunni converted kingdom
 uski tulana osmani samrajya se kii jane lagi jo us samay islam kaa sarvesarva the
 Mecca was under the Osmanis at that time
 pashchim kii disha main santusht hone ke baad nadir shah ne purab kii ore apana dhyaan kendrit kiya
 The burden of military expenditure fell on the public
 usne kandahaar par adhikaar kar liya
 By making an excuse that the Mughals had given shelter to the Afghan fugitives, he traveled towards the Mughal Empire
 kabul par kabja karne ke baad usne dilli par akraman kiya
 In Karnal, there was a fight between the Mughal king Mohammad Shah and Nadir's army
 isamen nadir kii sena mughalon ke mukaable choti thi par apane barudi astron ke kaaran farsi sena jeet gai
 On reaching Delhi in March 1739, it was rumored that Nadir Shah was killed
 isse dilli main bhagdad much gai or farsi sena kaa katl shuru ho gaya
 To avenge this, he committed terrible bloodshed in Delhi and killed some 20,000 - 22,000 people in a single day
 iske alaava usne shah se vipul dhanrashi bhi lee
 Mohammad Shah also donated all the land west of the Indus River to Nadir Shah
 heere jawaharaat kaa ek zakhira bhi use bhent kiya gaya jisamen kohenur, dariyaa - nur or taj - e - meh shaamil the jinaki ek apni khooni kahani he
 The wealth that Nadir got was around 70 crore rupees
 yah raashi apane tatkaaleen saatvarshiya yuddh ke tulya tha jisamen france kii sarkaar ne austria kii sarkaar ko diya tha
 Nadir did not aim for empire expansion in Delhi
 uskaa uddeshy apni sena ke liye aavashyak dhanrashi ikaitha kerani thi jo use mil gai thi
 It is said that on his return from Delhi he had so much money that he did not tax the public for the next three years
 dilli se lautne par use pataa chalaa ki uske bete raza quli, jise ki usne apni anupasthiti main waisarai bana diya tha, ne saafavi shah tahamashp or abbaas kii hatya kar di he
 This gave him a clue that Raza is also plotting against him
 isi dar se usne raza ko vysarai se padchyut kar diya
 He then went on an expedition to Turkestan and then went on to suppress the rebellion of Dagestan
 par yahan par use safalataa nahin mili
 The Lezgo adopted the Khandak war policy and attacked Rashad's caravan and disturbed Nadir
 jab wo dagestan main tha to nadir ko khabar mili ki raza usko maarane kii yojana bana rahaa he
 This angered him and he blinded Raza
 raza ne kaha ki wo nirdosh he par nadir ne uski ek na suni
 But a few days later Nadir regrets his mistake
 is samay nadir biimaar ho chalaa tha or apane bete ko andhaa karne ke kaaran bahut kshubdh
 Nadir Shah ordered that the heads of the warlords be blown to see the blows of his son Raza Quli
 nadir shah ne un saradaaron kii galati yah tehrai ki unamem se kisi ne yah kyon nahin kaha ki raza quli ke bajaaye uski ankhen phod di jaayen
 Dagestan's failure was also eating him
 dhire-dhire vah or atyaachaari banataa gaya
 After he returned empty-handed from Dagestan, he regrouped his army for a much older goal - the Osmanian Empire of the West
 us samay jab sena sangathit hui to uski ginati thi - 3,75,000 sainik
 Hardly any army had such an empire at that time
 iran kii khud kii sena itani badi 1980 - 1988 ke iran - iraq yuddh se pehle fir kabhi nahin hui
 In 1743, he attacked the Osmanian Empire Iraq
 shaharon ko chhod kar kahin bhi use bahut virodh kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 Kirkuk was captured but he did not succeed in Baghdad and Basra
 mosul main uske mahattvakanksha kaa ant hua or use osmanon ke saath samjhauta karnaa padaa
 Nadir understood that Usmani could not come under his control
 idhar nae osmani sainik uske khilaaf bheje gaye
 Nadir Shah's son Nasirullah defeated one of these, while Nadir defeated another in 1745 near Yerevan
 par yah uski aakiri badi jeet thi
 In this, the Usman gave him the right to rule at close quarters
 nadir kaa ant uski bimariyon se ghira rahaa
 He had become ill, persecuted and staunch for the day
 apane aakiri dinon main usne janata par baari kar lagaae or yahan tak ki apane kareebi rishtedaaron se bhi dhan kii maang karne laga tha
 His military expenditure had increased considerably
 uske bhattije ali quli ne uske adeshon ko maanane se manaa kar diya
 On 19 June 1747, he was killed by his own bodyguards near Mashhad
 nadir shah kii uplabdhiyaan adhik dinon tak tik nahin sakin
 Ali Quli declared himself Shah after he died
 usne apana naam adil shah rakh liya
 After Nadir died, the army dispersed and the empire began to rule independently by satraps
 europea prabhaav bhi badhata hi gaya
 Nadir had gained a reputation as a winner in Europe
 san 1768 main denmark ke chrishchiyan saptam ne sar wiliam jones ko nadir ke itihaaskaar mantri mirza mahadi astaraabdali dwaara likhi uski jeevani ko farsi se french main anuwaad karne kaa aadesh diya
 After his conquest of India in 1739, the British came to know about the weakness of the Mughals and tried to force the expansion of empire in India as an opportunity
 agar nadir shah bharat par akraman nahin karata to british shaayad is tarah se bharat main adhikaar karne ke bare main shaayad soch bhi nahin pate yaa itane bade paimaane par bhartiya shashan ko chunauti nahin dete

 The prevailing approach in American universities emphasized Sanskritic traditions to understand the society of the Indian subcontinent
 iske asar main bhartiya samajashastri samakaleen yatharth ke adhyayan ke liye sanskrit ke sroton or bharat- vidya / indolji ko zyaada pramanik maanate the
 Srinivas was the first sociologist to challenge this dominant position
 unhone apane lekhan se sabit kiya ki samajashaastra main samaaj ke vaastavik kaaryakalapon or gatividhiyon kaa adhyayan shastreey sandarbhon par nirbhar rahane se zyaada shreyaskar he
 The concepts of dominant caste and Sanskritisation presented by Srinivas have been widely used by historians of streams like subaltern of history-writing besides political scientists
 is arth main unke krititv ko ek bauddhik parampara kii shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he jo naye-puraane vidwaanon ke liye ek zaruri sandarbh kii haisiyat hasil kar chukaa he
 Incidentally, the concept of dominant caste reflects dominance in a particular village or region of a caste due to factors such as number force, land ownership, education and job, so Sanskritisation is the culture of upper castes especially Brahmin class by lower castes
 Indicates the tendency to adopt customs, language and costumes etc
 haalaanki unki teesri avadharana vot bank, samaaj-vigyaanon main sthai jagah nahin bana paayi parantu raajnneeti ke dainik vimarsh or media jagat main is pad kaa dhadlle se istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In studying the political and social structure of independent India, all these three concepts and related discourse have acquired immediate significance
 prabhutvshaalee jati or samskruthikaran kii avadharanaayen bharat kii saamaajik vyavastha or uske santhnik dhaanche ke nirnaayak tattvon ko samajhane main madad karti hai
 Although the concept of Sanskritisation is no longer considered as important due to the decreasing legitimacy of Brahminical ideals, the fact remains that Sanskritisation was a fairly notable trend for a long period of the twentieth century and even after independence
 dalit andolan or mandal ayog ke baad ubhari raajnneeti main samskruthikaran kii pravriti ksheen hoti gayi he lekin prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana ko bharat ke gramin samaaj main chalane vaali raajnneetik prakriyaaon kaa vishleshan karne main aaj bhi ek jaruri aujaar kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 Many contemporary sociologists have been urging to assess Srinivas's work in the larger context of nationalist sociology
 unka kahana he ki swatantra bharat kaa shahari abhijan aupniveshik shashan ke aadhunikeekaran kii pariyojna ko jari rakhana chahta tha
 Therefore, the same colonial arrays of thought and thought were active in the work of nationalist sociologists on the basis of which the British power had been legitimizing its rule
 in vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki jati or samudaay par kendrit shrinivas jaise samajashastriyon kaa krititv ek akhil bhartiya sanskritvaadi hindu dharm kii samaj ko peethika pradaan karata he
 But Srinivas's vision is a hasty plea to be overtly or indirectly guided by the foundations of British or American anthropology, which, despite the lack of evidence, dares to prepare charge sheets
 yah daleel shrinivas ke krititv kii us pravriti ko lakshith karne main chook karti he jisamen shrinivas samudaay kaa adhyayan karte hue samudaay or apane sambandhon ke dwait par bhi vichaar karte hai
 Srinivas considers the basic foundations of sociology and anthropology in a similar way
 gauratlab he ki shrinivas sahabhaagi adhyeta ke taur par khud ko ek aise adhyeta ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jisaki iyatta apane vishay yani logon se alag nahin he
 Srinivas did not classify the people or community he studied
 is sambandh main kai british maanavshastri yah maanate rahe hai apane samaaj kaa adhyayan karne vaale maanavshastri ko alag tarah kii mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 According to him, the anthropologist of the developed country always wants to imprison an indigenous anthropologist in a particular mold by pointing to his inferior position
 shrinivas ne is masale par deshaj maanavshastri kii sthiti ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ki jab koi bhartiya maanavshastri bharat kii kisi jati yaa anya samooh kaa adhyayan karata he to vah jati yaa samooh uske liye anya bhi hota he lekin saath hi is baat ko darkinar nahin karnaa chahie ki us jati yaa samooh ke katipay saanskrithik rup, vishwaas or mulya ukt adhyeta se bhi mail khate hai
 That is, in such a situation the Indian anthropologist actually studies the self in one way or the other
 is myne main vah jati yaa samooh uske liye nitant aparichit yaa anya nahin rah jaataa kyonki donon ek hi samskruti se jude hote hai
 Srinivas considers this situation as unusually complex, multilayered and duplex
 dhyaan se dekhen to shrinivas apane vishay ke saath antar or samanta ke jin binduon baat karte hai unhen dekhte hue un par rashtravaadi samajashastri hone kaa aarope damdaar nahin lagata
 In fact, Srinivas stresses that this multiplicity of self and others in study is far better than the anthropologist's singularity of being a member or an outsider of his community
 yah gauratlab he ki apane shodh adhyayan ke liye shrinivas ne jis rampura gaanv ko chunaa tha uski jati vyavastha ke adhyayan main ve chicago skool ke kai prekshanon kaa upyog karte hai
 Srinivas proving the pre-british concept of varna as a bookish point of view, saying that this vision dwarfs the dynamic aspects of caste
 haalaanki shrinivas kaa jati-adhyayan ek gaanv kii sthaneey sanrachana par kendrit tha lekin vah is parighatna kii akhil bhartiya vyapti ko lekar bhi sachet the
 In one of his articles, he points to the fact that caste is undoubtedly an all-india structure, as groups can be seen everywhere in the country that form a distinct group based on paternal and marital relationships
 shrinivas is sambandh main in samoohon ke parmparik rojgaar kaa hawala bhi dete hai
 He also says that the existence of castes serving Brahmins, untouchables, farmers, artisans, merchants and others can be seen everywhere in the country
 jati ke is adhyayan main shrinivas kshetreey bhinnataaon or pashchimi shiksha, prashasnic naukari, shahar se milane vaali aay jaise karkon kaa bhi ullekh karte hai jinka jati kii sanrachana par vyapak asar padaa he
 In the long term, Srinivas, as a sociologist, has also freed the Indian village and caste structure from the theoretical dominance of colonial perceptions
 or saath hi dyumon jaise samajashastri kii manyataon kaa bhi pratwaad kiya jo yah pratipaadit kar rahe the ki jatigat vibhinnataayen bhartiya gaanv ko samudaay kaa rup nahin lene detii
 When Srinivas talks about the concept of rural community and the economic-cultural interdependence of villages, he also talks about All India Civilization in a latent manner
 kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki shrinivas ne jati ke adhyayan main brahmanvaadi yaa ucch jati kaa drushtikon apanaaya he
 But looking at this argument from the right angle, it seems to have originated from colonial sociology
 shrinivas kii tark-yojana vastav main pashchimi samajashastriyon kii bharat ke gramin samudaayon ke sambandh main pratipaadit sthool or alp-chintit dharanaon ko ujagar karti he
 In a nutshell, Srinivas's work provides many basic arguments in the Western discourse of philosophical propositions, perceptions of self, community and nation

 The presence of elites of society, of gurus, kutumbi-relatives, deities is considered essential on the occasion of this ritual, that if either of them disregards this duty, then stop and torture it
 pati-patni in sanbhrant vyaktiyon ke sammukh apane nishchay kii, pratigya-bandhan kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 The pledge ceremony is the wedding ceremony
 vivaah sanskaar main dev pujan, yajna aadi se sambandhit sabhi vyavasthaayen pehle se banaakar rakhni chahie
 In marriage ceremony, all arrangements related to Dev Pujan, Yajna etc
 should be made in advance
 samuhik vivaah ho, to prayek jode ke hisaab se prayek vedi par aavashyak saamagree rahani chahie, camercand thik se hote chalem, iske liye prayek vedi par ek-ek jaankaar vyakti bhi niyukt karnaa chahie
 If there is only one marriage, then the teacher can take care of himself

 Thread ceremony is done before marriage
 avivaahiton ko ek yagyopavit tathaa vivaahiton ko joda pehanaane kaa niyam he
 If the Yajnopavit has not been done, if the new Yajnopavit has been done, then the ritual of wearing a pair in place of one should be done
 acha ho ki jis shubh din ko vivaah-sanskaar hona he, us din praatavkaal yagyopavit dhaaran kaa kram vyavasthit dhang se kara diya jaae
 It is strange to wear a Yajnopavit after removing the clothes etc
 of the bride dressed for the marriage ceremony
 isliye usko pehle hi puraa kar liya jaae
 If that is not possible, then the Yagyopaveet is put on reception
 use vastron par hi pahana dena chahie, jo sanskaar ke baad andar kar liya jaataa he
 Where there is a ritual of Dwarachar before the main rites at the traditional wedding ceremonies at the family level, if it is possible to make the atmosphere of the halls appropriate for the rites, then the cases of reception and clothing and flowers can be completed at that time also

 Archaeological Tourism puratathvik paryaton saarvajanik puraatatv main ruchi or aitihaasik sthalon ke sangrakshan ko badhaava dene ke liye karte he jo saanskrithik paryaton, kaa ek rup he
 Heritage tours can include visiting archaeological sites, museums, interpretation centers, renaming historical events, and all products associated with public archaeological enrichment, including the rediscovery of indigenous products, festivals, or theaters
 puratathvik sthalon or aitihaasik sthanon duniya bhar main pramukh paryatak aakarshan hai
 Over the years, visiting historical sites ranks third - among the work done by Americans traveling abroad - after dining in restaurants and shopping
 puratathvik sthalon kii yatra he ki logon kii sankhya hryr saal bad jaataa he or yatayaat main vruddhi citon ko nuksaan main parinaam kar sakate hai
 In extreme cases, the sites have been closed to the public to prevent further damage
 puraatatv paryaton aakraamak paryaton banane ke prakaar, puratathvik sthalon ko badhaava dene or ek kshetra kii saanskrithik viraasat or unhen or adhik nuksaan ho saktaa he is ke bich ek line thik chalata he
 Archaeologists have expressed concern that tourism is watching and encourages special ways of knowing the past
 jab puratathvik sthalon ek praathamikta ban saktaa he paryaton board, tikat kii fees or smarika rajasav dwaara chalaae ja rahe hai, or sawaal ek site janata ke liye kholane yaa band shesh or nuksaan ke raste se baahar site rakhane laayak he yaa nahin rahata he
 Damage to irreplaceable archaeological materials is not discernible, only when the remains are disordered, as altered, destroyed, or robbed, but often of tourist facilities such as hotels, restaurants, streets, and shops Indirect result of poorly planned development
 ye kaaphi pracheen sanrachanaon baadh, bhuskhalan kaa utpaadan, yaa kamjor tareekon main he ki paryaavaran main parivartan kar sakate hai
 Archaeological tourism reflects the process by which people travel to historical and archaeological places of interest
 yah puratathvik paryaton kyon kaha jaataa he kaaran yah he ki aksar aise misr main pyramid ke rup main sthanon or pracheen kaal main waapas dating kalakritiyon kii khoj kii gai he, jahaan puratathvik sthalon kaa daura vyavastha karne ke uddeshy se he ki is tathy ke liye he
 Archaeological tourism can be a means for tourists to satisfy their curiosity about ancient sites or it can be students and scholars, which may be for the purpose of educating tourists
 sabase adhik baar, yah puravasheshon unki samrudh saanskrithik viraasat ke bare main logon ko shikshit karne kaa ek saadhan ke rup main puratathvik paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye sthit hai, jahaan is kshetra kii sarkaar he, yaa bas ek saadhan ke rup main aane vaale paryatakon se kuch paise banane ke liye
 Tourism is such a big business that some economies are mainly dependent on it for their survival
 is kaaran se, kuch sarkarein apni samskruti ko badhaava dene saktaa he or adhik dhan arjeet karne ke liye ek saadhan ke rup main puratathvik paryaton protsaahit karte hai
 Tourists spend money on airfare, transportation, food, accommodation, services and purchase of artifacts
 sarkaar bhi is tarah ke paryatakon dwaara vyay par lagaae gaye karon se laabh
 An archaeological tourist destination artifacts are kept for themselves from actual excavation sites where anything from museums to interest can be found
 kabhi kabhi puratathvik paryaton ab koi maujuud ho saktaa he ki kuch saanskrithik praasangik logon kii tarah dekhne ke liye is tarah ke aitihaasik sthalon kaa manoranjan yaa adhik aadhunik citon ke anukaran ke rup main anya sambandhit suvidhaon, shaamil he
 For example, the simulation would look like a city since ancient times that might include something like a ghost town
 puratathvik paryaton kii khaamiyon main se ek badi sankhya main in sthanon par utarana jo paryatakon kii bheed ke dwaara sahi myne main aitihaasik sthalon ke samaksh rakhi ja sakati he ki khatra he
 Even more stringent is the prohibition, there is not always the risk of some form of damage to such places possibly affecting the fairness of historical sites
 paryatakon ko deevaaron par pracheen chitron ke saath gufaaon kaa daura karte hai, udhaaharan ke liye, manushya kii lagaataar yatayaat jagah kii thik tarah se sangrakshit sthiti kaa ksharan karne ke liye netritv kar sakate hai
 This archeological tourism is a good compromise for the reduction in the historical value of the revenue it has to get from the tourism trade, so it must decide where the government of the region is taking paryatakon ke aakarshan ke rup main puratathvik sthalon main se vah lokapriyata ve rajasav ke moolyawaan strot hai ki iskaa matlab he, lekin durbhaagya se is baar paryatakon dwaara iske bare main donon site ke sangrakshan or jari rakhaa bhoga sunishchit karne ke liye uchit prabandhan main punarnivesh ke anuroop nahin he
 Archaeological sites are fragile resources and insufficient site management will result in degradation or even destruction of the site and its associated social, historical, educational and economic potential
