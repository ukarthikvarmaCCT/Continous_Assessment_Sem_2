prakaash-sanshleshan ek rachanaatmak kriya he iske falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main vruddhi hoti he
 Respiration is a nasal activity, which results in a decrease in the dry weight of living organisms
 prakaash-sanshleshan main saurya urja ke prayog se bhojan banataa he, vikiran urja kaa roopaantaran rasinic urja main hota he
 While the oxidation of food in respiration releases energy, the chemical energy stored in the food is used lively in its various functions
 is prakaar ye donon kriyaaye apane kachche maal ke liye ek duusare ke ant padaarthon par nirbhar rahete hue ek duusare kii poorak hoti hai
 Photosynthesis takes place only from green plants and the equation is very simple
 phir bhi yah ek vivadagrast prashn he ki kis prakaar CO2 evam pani jaise saral padaarth, carbohydrates jaise jatil padaarthon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 From time to time, various plant technology experts have expressed different views to understand this activity
 inamen baiyar, willstator tathaa stall tathaa aranon ke mat pramukh hai
 The votes of Baird, Wilsetter and Staal have only historical significance
 inako baad ke pareekshanon main sahi nahin paaya gaya
 In 1967, Arnone reported that the protein found in the chloroplast had a major function in photosynthesis
 aadhunik yug main sabhi vaigyanikon dwaara yah maanya he ki prakaash sanshleshan main swatantra oxygen pani se aati he
 On the basis of many experiments in modern times, it has been proved that the process of photosynthesis takes place in the following two stages
 pehle charan main prakaash prakriya athwa hill prakriya athwa photochemical prakriya
 And in the second stage the dark process or the Blackman process or the lightless process
 prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main donon prakriyaayen ek duusare ke pashchaat hoti he
 The light process ignores the dark process more quickly
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya paudhe ke sabhi chloroplast yukt koshikaon main hoti he
 That means all the green parts of the plant
 yah kriya visheshtah pattiyon ke mesophil utak main hoti he kyonki pattiyon ke mesophil utak kii perenima koshikaon main anya koshikaon kii upeksha chloroplast kii maatra adhik hoti he
 The process of photosynthesis that takes place in the presence of light is studied under light action
 is kriya ko hill aadi anya vaigyanikon dwaara adhyayan kiya gaya
 Dark processes act as a limiting factor when lighting processes
 prakaash prakriyaayen do charnon main hoti hai, photolysis evam hydrogen kaa sthaapan
 In the process of photolysis, light is absorbed as a photon by a molecule of chlorophyll
 jab chlorophyl kaa anu ek kwantem prakaash shoshit kar letaa he uske pashchaat chlorophyl kaa doosraa anu tab tak prakaash shoshit nahin karata he jab tak ki pehali urja prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main prayog nahin ho jaati he
 Photons of light thus absorbed by chlorophyll ejects an electron at high energy levels and this power is located on the third bond of phosphate and appears as high-energy adenosine triphosphate
 is prakaar chloropil prakaash kii upasthiti main atipi utpann karte hai tathaa is prakriya ko phosphorailation kehete hai
 In this way, the energy of sunlight is converted into ATP, ie chemical energy
 is prakaar chlorophyl anu main nirmit atipi chlorophyl anu se pruthak hokar CO2 ko sharkara main anoksikrut hone aadi anek rasinic kriyaaon main sahaayak he
 Chlorophyll becomes inert again upon freeing this ATP
 vaan nil frank, vishanik ke anusaar pani jab is kriyasheel chlorophyl ke sampark main aate hai tab pani anoksikrut h tathaa tej oxykaarak OH main vichchhedit ho jaataa he
 Chlorophyll + Light → Activated Chlorophyll H2O + Activated Chlorophyll → h + + OH- In this photolysis process O2 is liberated from water and hydrogen also moves to the hydrogen subscriber
 2H2O + 2A → 2AH2 + O2 is prakaar paudhon kii prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriyaayon se nikali samast oxygen jal se praapt hoti hai
 Hill, Reuben supported it and proved it using O18
 pani se oxygen nikalne ko chlorilla naamak shaiwal main CO2 kii anupasthiti main dikhaaya gaya
 This means that oxygen can be produced in the absence of CO2, but it must have hydrogen content
 aisa dekha gaya he ki paudhon main enedipi do NADPH2 banaata he
 2H2O + 2NADP = 2NADPH2 + O2 aranan ke matanusaar prakaash kriya mukhya rup se nirmaan se sambandhit he
 NADPH2 / NADP is formed by degradation
 NADP ko TPN bhi kehete hai
 ATP is a light energy molecule formed by the joining of a phosphate group in ADP and this action is called phosphorylation
 edipi ke phosforilation main prakaash urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he atah ise photo-phosforilation bhi kehete hai
 It is also a complex process and according to Aranan the lighting process takes place in two processes
 ayugma photo-phosforilation tathaa yugma photo-phosforileshvyugma photo-phosforilation main pani ke apghaton ke kaaran electron nirantar praapt hote he tathaa photo-phosforilation kii kriya par chlorophyl main prakaash urja se atipi kaa nirmaan hota rahata he
 Thus upon activation of chlorophyll 'a', ferredoxin acts as an electron receptor to give a coenzyme called NADP in which NAD is converted to NADPH2 by capturing hydrogen released by water
 is prakaar pani main vighatan main hue mukt electron chlorophyl ‘b’ ko uttejit kar ucch urja str par pahoonch jate hai tathaa ye electron phir kas prakaar chlorophyl ‘a’ ko praapt hote hai, purna rup se gyaat nahin he lekin aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki plastokavinon naamak electron grahi in electronon ko pakad letaa he jo cytochrome dwaara punah chlorophyl ‘a’ main pahunch jate hai
 It also produces ATP simultaneously
 yugma photo-phosforilation kii kriya main surya ke prakaash se chlorophyl ‘a’ sakriy hokar electron ko baahar kii ore phankta he jo chlorophyl main upasthit ferydoxin dwaara pakad liye jate hai
 This electron is liberated and is captured by an electron receptor called plastoquinone
 is kriya ke madhya main edipi, atipi main parivartit ho jaataa he tathaa electron punah mukt hokar cytochrome vikar se hokar chlorophyl ‘a’ main vaapis pahunch jaataa he
 In this action also, ADP is converted into ATP
 is kriya main bahari electron prayog nahin hota tathaa chlorophyl se electron nikalakar punah vahiin vaapis aa jaataa he
 In this way water is decomposed by paired and combustion processes, which liberates oxygen gas and is captured by hydrogen, hydrogen receptor NADP as well as energy classified which is used in chemical process or unpublished reaction
 
 oxigen tathaa prakaash-sanshleshan This process does not require light
 is prakriya main praayah carbondioxide kaa avkaran hota he
 In this process, the carbon dioxide absorbed by the stomata of the leaf, due to the energy of hydrogen light released from the water, forms a permanent liquid
 CH2O, yah ek carbohydrates kii ikai anu he
 Calvin and Banson reported using radioisotropic techniques that the first permanent compound in the photosynthesis process was a 3-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acid
 chlorolla evam sindesmas naamak shaiwalon main radio active C14O2 kii upasthiti main kuch samay ke liye prakaash-sanshleshan karaayaa gaya tathaa inamen bhi pehla sthai dravya phosphoglicerick amla bana
 This phosphoglyceric acid subsequently forms glucose
 is prakaar kelvin tathaa uske sahakarmiyon ke kaaryon se yah siddh ho gaya ki prakaash-sanshleshan prakriya main CO2 glucose main parivartit ho jaati he
 He used isotopes of carbon in this experiment
 chlorophyl main ribuloj-1,5 visphosphate upasthit rahata he
 Now atmospheric CO2 penetrates through the leaf stomata and enters immediately, forming a temporary compound with ribulose-1,5 visphosphate
 is prakaar bana asthai yogic jo 5-carbon sugar he sheeghra hi phosphoglaicerick acid ke 2 anuon main tut jaataa he
 Now here, when hydrogen is released by NADPH2, it converts PGA to PGAL
 is kriya main urja atipi se praapt hoti he
 In this way CO2 creates carbohydrates
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii andheri prakriya main jin paudhon main pehla sthai yogic phosphoglissrik amla banataa he unhen C3 paudha kehete hai
 Phosphoglyceric acid is a 3-carbon additive, hence these plants are named so
 jin paudhon main pehla sthai yogic 4 carbon vaala yogic banataa he unako C4 paudha kehete hai
 The compound with 4 carbons is usually oxaloacetic acid
 pehle aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki prakaash-sanshleshan main carbondioxide ke sthirikaran yaa yogikeekaran ke samay keval C3 yaa kelvin chakra hi hota tha arthath pehla sthai yogic phosphoglissrik amla hi banataa he
 But in 1966 Hatch and Slack pointed out that there is also a second path for the stabilization of carbon dioxide
 unhone ganna, makka, ameranthus aadi paudhon main adhyayan kar bataaya ki phosphoinol piruvik amla jo ki 3 carbon visisth yogic he carbondioxide se sanyukt hokar 4 carbon visisth yogic oxaloecetic amla banaata he
 In this activity, phosphoinol acts as a pyruvate carboxylase enzyme catalyst
 prakaash-sanshneshan kii kriya main chaar mukhya avyav hai, jal, carbondioxide, prakaash evam parn harim
 The presence of these four is very important for this action
 inamen se jal evam carbondioxide ko prakaash-sanshleshan kaa kaccha maal kehete hai kyonki inke rachanaatmak avyavon dwaara hi prakaash-sanshleshan ke mukhya utpaada carbohydrate kii rachana hoti he
 The plant takes these ingredients from the environment around them
 carbondioxide prakaash-sanshleshan kaa ek mukhya avyav tathaa kaccha padaarth he
 Carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere is released by the actions of respiration, combustion, fermentation, dissolution etc
 vaayu main isaki maatra 0
03 % se 0
04 % hoti he
 Terrestrial plants take it directly from the air
 in paudhon kii pattiyon main chote chhidr hote hai jinhe parnarandhra kehete hai
 Carbon dioxide enters the leaves of the plant from these same foliage
 jalmagn paudhe jal main ghuli carbondioxide ko apni shaareerik sataha se visaran dwaara grahan karte hai
 The sources of carbon dioxide in water are aquatic animals, whose gases are produced in respiration
 jal ke bheetar chattaanon main upasthit carbonate tathaa bicarbonate ke vighatan se bhi carbondioxide utpann hoti he jisko jaleey paudhe prakaash-sanshleshan main grahan karte hai
 Carbohydrates called glucose are formed in photosynthesis
 isamen carbon tathaa oxigen tatv ke parmaanu carbondioxide se hi praapt hote hai
 Chlorophyll Chlorophyll is a proteinated complex chemical compound
 yah prakaash-sanshleshan kaa mukhya varnak he
 There are two types of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b
 yah sabhi swaposhi hare paudhon ke chloroplast main paaya jaataa he
 Chlorophyll molecules absorb sunlight energy and convert it into chemical energy
 surya ke prakaashiya urja ko avashoshit karke chlorophyl kaa anu uttejit ho jate hai
 These active molecules decompose the water molecules into h + and oh-ions
 is prakaar chlorophyl ke anu prakaash-sanshleshan kii jaev-rasaynic kriya ko prarambh karte hai
 Light Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis
 balb aadi ke teevr kritrim prakaash main bhi prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya hoti he
 This activity is most common in red light
 laal ke baad begni rang ke prakaash main yah kriya sabase adhik hoti he
 Both these colors are absorbed by chlorophyll in the greatest amount
 hare rang ko chlorophyl puri tarah paravartit kar dete hai atah har rang ke prakaash main prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya puri tarah ruuk jaati he
 Water is the raw material for photosynthesis
 sthaliy paudhe ise mitti se jad ke mulromon dwaara avashoshit karte hai
 Aquatic plants absorb water from the outer surface of their water contact parts
 orchid jaise upararohi paudhe apane viviya mulon dwaara vayumandaleey jalawaashp ko grahan karte hai
 Oxygen is produced by the optical breakdown of water in the optical reaction of photosynthesis
 yahi oxigen upapadaarth ke rup main vaataavaran main mukt hota he
 The molecules of hydrogen are obtained from water in the glucose molecules formed in the half reaction
 prakaash-sanshleshan ke samay jal apratyaksh rup se bhi kai kaary karata he
 It maintains activity of organisms and activation of enzymes
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya anek karkon dwaara prabhavit hoti he
 Some of its factors are external and some are internal
 iske atirikt kuch seemaabaddh kaarak bhi hote hai
 External causes are those that affect photosynthesis while being located in nature and environment, such as light, since the plant receives energy for this activity from sunlight and this action is not possible from darkness
 carbondai oxide, kyon ki aisa dekha gaya he ki yadi anya sabhi kaarak paudhe ko ucchtam maatra main praapt hon tathaa vayumandal main CO2 kii maatra dhire-dhire badhaai jaye to prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar bhi bad jaati he
 Temperature, because it has been observed that a certain temperature is also required for photosynthesis in plants and water is very important for water photochemical processes and it supports many chemical changes during this process
 aantarik kaaran ve hote hai jo pattiyon main sthit hote hue prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya ko prabhavit karte hai jaise- parnaharith yaa chlorophil jiske dwaara prakaash urja rasinic urja main parivartit hoti he
 Pruss / organism / protoplasm in which wickers are found affect the photosynthesis
 bhojya padaarth kaa jamaav, kyon ki prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya main bana bhojan yadi sthaneey koshikaon main ekatrit hota rahe to prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar dhimi ho jaati he
 The internal structure of the leaves is because the rate of photosynthesis depends on the number of stomata or stomata present in the leaves and their closing and opening time
 pattiyon kii aayu, kyon ki nai pattiyon main puraani pattiyon kii apkshaa prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar adhik hoti he
 In addition, the photosynthesis also affects the different speeds of all these objects
 jab prakaash sanshleshan kii ek kriya vibhinn karkon dwaara niyantrit hoti he tab prakaash sanshleshan kii gati sabase mand kaarak dwaara niyantrit hoti he
 Whatever is less than the appropriate amount of light, carbon dioxide, water, chlorophyll etc
, it controls the speed of the whole action
 yah kaarak samay vishesh ke liye seemaabaddh kaarak kaha jaataa he

 By obtaining the necessary energy from activated chlorophyll, the water molecules are broken down which gives hydrogen and oxygen
 If you also feel the math is good then your future is bright, how come? The excited electrons give their energy through a special system, which is called the electron transfer mechanism

 The Communal and Targeted Violence Prevention Bill is a bill in India that is currently in the process of completion
 is adhinium kaa praaroop sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan kii adhyaksha shrimati sonia gandhi ke netritv vaali rashtriya salaahkaar parishad ke dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Many social organizations like the major political parties Bharatiya Janata Party, Shiv Sena All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Trinamool Congress like Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Vishwa Hindu Parishad are opposing this bill on the basis that this act only provides protection to minorities but The Act does not provide any protection to the majority victims of minority attacks
 is prakaar yah adhinium muslimon ke haathon main hinduon ke viruddh ek shastr ke bhaanti kaary karegaa tathaa yah bharat ke sangheey dhaanche ke liye hanikaarak siddh hoga
 == history == tesr is vidheyak ko sarvapratham manmohan singh ke netritv vaali sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan kii sarkaar ne 2005 main lagu karne kaa prayaas kiya tha parantu baari virodh ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne ise waapas le liya tha
 In 2011, again the government brought this bill with some amendments under which the people of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have also been brought under this bill but the opponents of this bill say that if there is any communal violence Muslims and Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes If it is between the tribes, then in that case, this bill will support the Muslims and thus to protect the Dalits
 The lit act will also become ineffective
 rashtriya salaahkaar parishad ne 14 july 2010 ko sampradayikta virdohi bill kaa khaakaa taiyaar karne ke liye ek praaroop samiti kaa gathan kiya tha or 28 april 2011 kii enesi baithak ke baad nau adhyyon or 138 dhaaraon main taiyaar hindi main anudit kiya or abhi tak kii sambhavit yojanao ke anusaar sarkaar ise 2011 ke sheetakaaleen satr main laane kii yojana par kaary kar rahi he
 The most controversial thing in this Act is that in this bill it has already been assumed that violent are only majority
 alpsankhyak nahin
 The most important aspect of the Bill is the definition of 'group'
 samooh se taatpary panthik yaa bhashaayi alpsankhyakon se he, jisamen aaj kii sthitiyon ke anuroop anusuchit jatiyon or anusuchit janajatiyon ko bhi shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 The biggest objection in the entire Bill is on the same point that the majority community is excluded from the language of the group
 khand 6 main yah spasht kiya gaya he ki is vidheyak ke antargat aparaadh un aparaadhon ke alaava he jo anusuchit jati evam janajati adhinium, 1989 ke adheen aate hai
 
 is vidheyak ke virdohi yah prashn puch rahe hai
 Whether a person can be punished twice for the same crime? khand 7 main nirdhaarit kiya gaya he ki kisi vyakti ko un halaat main yon sambandhi aparaadh ke liye doshi mana jaayegaa yadi vah kisi 'samooh se sambandh rakhane vaale vyakti ke, jo us samooh kaa sadsy he, viruddh koi yon aparaadh karata he
 But if the victim is not a member of that group then it will not be considered a crime
 This will have the direct effect that if there is any sexually abusive rape of a Hindu woman in the event of communal riots then it will not fall under the category of crime as it would not fall under the definition of Hindu women's group
 khand 8 main yah nirdhaarit kiya gaya he ki 'ghrinaa sambandhi prachaar un halaat main aparaadh mana jaayegaa jab koi vyakti maukhik taur par yaa likhit taur par yaa spashtatya amyavedan karke kisi 'samooh aav kisi 'samooh se sambandh rakhane vaale vyakti ke viruddh ghrinaa failaata he

 Opponents say that if a minority hurts a majority or causes mental or physical injury, it is objectionable to keep this bill silent in that regard
 khand 13 main kisi sarkari vyakti ko is vidheyak main ullikhit aparaadhon ke sambandh main apni duty nibhaane main dhilaai baratane ke liye dandit kiye jane kaa praavdhaan he

 worldcat is a union catalog that itemizes the collections of 72,000 libraries in 170 countries and territories which participate in the Online Computer Library Center global cooperative
 It is built and maintained collectively by the participating libraries
 The catalog was created in 1971
 It contains more than 300 million records, representing over 2 billion physical and digital assets in more than 470 languages, as of January 2014
 It is the world's largest bibliographic database
 OCLC makes worldcat itself available free to libraries, but the catalog is the foundation for other fee-based OCLC services
 worldcat was founded by Fred Kilgour in 1967
 In 2003, OCLC began the "open worldcat" pilot program, making abbreviated records from a subset of worldcat available to partner web sites and booksellers, to increase the accessibility of its member libraries' collections
 In 2006, it became possible to search worldcat directly at its website
 In 2007, worldcat Identities began providing pages for 20 million "identities", predominantly authors and persons who are the subjects of published titles
 worldcat operates on a batch processing model rather than a real-time model
 That is, worldcat records are synchronized at intermittent intervals with the underlying library catalogs instead of real-time or every day
 worldcat shows that a particular item is owned by a particular library, but does not provide that library's call number
 It also does not indicate if the item is currently borrowed, lost, undergoing restoration or repair, or moved to storage not directly accessible to patrons
 worldcat also does not show if a library owns multiple copies of a particular title
 As an alternative, worldcat allows participating institutions to add direct links from worldcat to their own catalog entries for a particular item, which enables the user to determine its real-time status
 However, this still requires users to open multiple Web pages, each pointing to a different OPAC with its own distinctive user interface design, until they can locate a catalog entry that shows the item is currently available at a particular library

 It has always been a problem for mankind to decide exactly what justice should mean and it has almost always been interpreted in terms of time
 mote taur par uskaa arth yah rahaa he ki acha kya he isi ke anusaar isse sambandhit manyata main pher-badal hota rahaa he
 As D
D
 The opinion of the raffle is- nyaay ke arth kaa nirnay karne kaa praytn sabase pehle unaniyon or romanon ne kiya 
 The Greek philosopher Aflatun defined justice as virtue, which should be combined with restraint, intelligence and courage
 unka kahana tha ki nyaay apane karttavya par arudh rahane, arthath samaaj main jiskaa jo sthaan he uskaa bhalee-bhanti nirvaah karne main nihit he 
 He was of the view that justice is the virtue which harmonizes between all other virtues
 unke anusaar, nyaay vah sadgun he jo kisi bhi samaaj main santulan laata he yaa uskaa parirakshan karata he
 His disciple Aristotle, while amending the meaning of justice, said that the meaning of justice is necessarily a certain level of equality
 yah samanta vyavhaar kii samanta tathaa anupatikata yaa tulyata par aadhaarit ho sakati he
 He further said that equality of behavior produces 'qualified justice' and proportionality results in 'distributive justice'
 isamen nyaayalayon tathaa nyaayadhishon kaa kaam yogyatanusaar nyaay kaa vitaran hota he or vidhayika kaa kaam vitaranatmak nyaay kaa vitaran hota he
 In legal disputes between two persons, the system of punishment should be in accordance with the principles of equitable justice, in which the judiciary should try to reach an intermediate point of equality and on the principles of distributive justice in the allocation of political rights, honor, property and goods
 Should walk iske saath hi kisi bhi samaaj main vitaranatmak or yogyatanusaari nyaay ke bich talmail baithaana aavashyak he
 As a result, Aristotle saw the concept of justice in any society as a transitional balance, which cannot always be in the same position
 romanon tathaa stoikon ne nyaay kii ek kinchit bhinn kalpana viksit kii
 He believed that justice does not derive from laws and practices, but it can only be achieved by reason and wisdom
 nyaay daivi hoga or sabake liye samaan
 The laws of society must conform to these laws; Only then will they make any sense, otherwise
 maanav-nirmit kanoon vastav main kanoon ho, iske liye yah aavashyak he ki vah is kanoon or prakritik nyaay kii kalpana se mail khaae
 The idea of this natural justice was first developed by the Stoics and later adopted by Roman Catholic priests
 is nyaay kii drushti main sabhi manushya samaan the
 In his work Institutes, Justinian distinguished between law developed or obtained by logic and common law or common law
 phir dharm-sudhaar andolan, punarjagran or audyogic kranti tak europe main is kshetra main kuch khaas nahin hua
 In the eyes of thinkers such as Locke, Rousseau and Kant - justice meant a mixture of freedom, equality and law
 praarambhik udaarvaadiyon ko samantvaad, nirankush rajtantr or jatigat visheshadhikaar anyaaypurna or isliye gaiyr-kanoonee prathit hue
 In his vision, justice without independence and equality had no meaning
 unnisvin sadi ke purv tak nyaay kii yahi abhidharana prachlit rahi or tab udaaravaadi or samaajawaadee athwa marxvad chintan-dhaaraon ke bich asahmati kaa udai hua
 Bentham and Mill's utilitarian theory dominated
 is siddhant ke anusaar, jo-kuch maanav-jati ke sukh yaa upyogita kii adhiktam vruddhi main sahaayak tha vahi nyaay tha
 He believed that happiness is contained in the absence of all sanctions, but then socialists and Marxists came out with the argument that the excesses of poverty and inequality created by capitalist secular relations are unjust and cannot be supported
 jahaan tak udaaravaadi chintan-dhaaraon kaa sambandh he, praarambhik clasiki udaarvaadiyon kaa nyaay-vishyak drushtikon hi beesvin sadi ke madhya tak udaarvaadiyon kaa mukhya drushtikon tha
 But with the rise of welfare states of Kens's imagination, it became necessary to develop a new concept of justice in the liberal tradition
 us abhidharana kii shaayad sabase acchhee vyakhya rolls-krit e theori of justise main hui he
 Another theory of justice emerged in the liberal tradition with the rise of neo-liberalism in the last decades of the twentieth century and what has been dubbed Libertarianism in the US
 darasal dekhen to ichaswatantrawad kaa matlab mukt bazaar, nunatam rajya or swatantraaa tathaa sampatti ke avikal adhikaron ke himachati praarambhik clasiki udaarvaadiyon kii nyaay kii abhidharana kii ore lautnaa tha

 ISO Code: njn pan ium udaan 73, pan american world airways kii ek bowing 747-121 udaan thi, jiskaa 5 sitambar, 1986 ko pakistan ke karachi main abu nidaal organizeshan ke chaar hathiyaarband philistini ugravadiyon dwaara apharan kar liya gaya tha
 The ship, carrying 360 passengers, had just arrived from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport to Jinnah International Airport in Karachi and was preparing to go to John F
 Kennedy Airport in New York, USA via Frankfurt, Germany
 june 2001 main ek adaalat main aatankwaadiyon par yah abhiyog laga ki ve saipras va israel main bandi apane kuch saathiyon ko chhudaana chaahate the
 But in 2006, Michael Thexton, a passenger who survived the incident, published a book in which he claimed he had heard hijackers talking that they wanted to crash the ship into a designated target in Israel
 is hijac ke dauraan 20 yatri maare gaye jinamein 12 bhartiya the tathaa baaki america, pakistan va mexico se the
 All the kidnappers were arrested and sentenced to death
 kintu, baad main unki sazaa ko umrakaid main badal diya gaya jiskaa ki bharat va america ne virodh kiya
 The incident started when passengers in Karachi started boarding this plane going to Frankfurt
 baad main hui epabiai jaanch main pataa chalaa ki vimaan ke aasapaas hathiyaarband rakshakon kii maujuudagi bhi is apharan ko taal nahin pai
 The four hijackers were disguised as Karachi airport security guards and were armed with assault rifles, grenades, pistols and plastic explosive belts

 The hijackers attacked the stairs itself and fired from automatic weapons, entered the aircraft and snatched away control
 flit atendent ne sthiti ko bhaanp liya or chaalak dal ko intercom par suchit kar diya jiske falswaroop payalat, sah-payalat or flite igeneer kaukapit ke apaat dwaar se safaltaapurvak nikal bhaage
 After capturing the aircraft, the hijacker Zaid Safarini soon realized that the crew had fled and was forced to negotiate with the authorities
 pratham va vayavsaayik shrenee ke yatriyon ko vimaan ke peeche kii ore jane kaa aadesh diya gaya tathaa peeche ke yatriyon ko aage aane ko kaha gaya
 Since the plane was almost full, passengers were since the plane was almost full, passengers sat down in the aisles, galleys and door exits
 At around 10 in the morning Safarini made a detour inside the aircraft and stopped in front of 29-year-old Indian American Rajesh Kumar's seat
 rajesh california kaa nivasee tha tathaa haal hi main use america naagarikta mili thi
 Safarini asked Rajesh to come forward and forced her to sit on her knees at the door of the plane with her back to the head
 adhikariyon, visheshtah viraph daroga se baatcheet karte hue usne kaha ki yadi chaalak dal ko 15 minute main vimaan main nahin bheja gaya to vah rajesh ko goli se uda degaa
 Shortly afterwards he got upset with the authorities and in front of everyone he shot Rajesh in the head and threw him on the ground outside the door
 pakistani adhikariyon kii report ke anusaar rajesh kii saans abhi chal rahi thi, kintu aspataal pahunchane se pehle raste main ambulance main hi uski mrityu ho gai
 Safarini then returned to the rest of her companions and instructed the flight attendants to collect the passports of all the passengers
 atendents ne apni jaan ke dar se is aadesh kaa paalan kiya
 One of the flight attendants, Neerja Bhanot, feared that American passport holders could be specially targeted, so she hid some American passports under one seat and some in the trash
 passport ikatthe karne ke baad ek kru sadsy ne intercom par ek british naagarik maaikel thexton ko vimaan ke agle hisse main aane ko kaha
 He reached the next part of the plane through the curtain where he encountered Safarini who had his passport in his hand
 usne thexton se poocha ki kahin vah sipaahi to nahin or kahin uske paas bandook to nahin
 Thexton replied no
 tab usne thexton ko ghutanon ke bal baithne ko kaha or adhikariyon se bolaa ki agar koi vimaan ke nazadik aayaa to vah ek or yatri ko mar daalega
 Viraf Daroga tells him that the aircraft has a crew member who can use the cockpit's radio and can be further negotiated through it
 safarini thexton ke paas vaapis gaya or poocha ki kya use pani chahie
 Thexton said - Yes
 safarini ne yah bhi poocha ki kya vah vivaahit he or daawa kiya ki use hinsa or ye sab maar kaat bilkul pasand nahin he lekin america or israel ne unke desh par kabza kar liya he or ve dhang kii zindagi nahin ji paa rahe
 Then a hijacker asked Thexton to return
 hijac kaa prakaran raat tak chalata rahaa
 During this time, a flight attendant quietly took out the leaf from the manual detailing all the systems of the 3R aircraft gate and concealed it in a magazine and gave it to the passenger sitting near the gate
 usne use kaha ki vah abhi magazine ko avashya pard le or baad main yadi aavashyaktaa padi to prayog kar le
 On this page, along with other information, the method of opening the exit gate and installing the slide apron was also described
 raat lagbhag 9 baje sahaayak vidyut unit band ho gayi, sabhi battiyaan bujh gayi tathaa immergency lite jal gayi
 Passengers at the front were ordered towards the back, while passengers at the back were ordered forward
 Since the aisles were already full of passengers, those passengers standing just sat down
 With the plane out of power and sitting in near darkness a hijacker at the 1L door said a prayer and then aimed to shoot at the explosive belt the other hijacker at the 1R door was wearing
 The intent was to cause an explosion massive enough to kill all passengers and crew on board, as well as themselves
 Since the cabin was so dark, the hijacker missed causing only a small detonation
 Immediately the hijackers began shooting their weapons into the cabin at passengers and attempted to throw their grenades
 Yet again the lack of light caused them to not pull pins fully and create small explosions
 Ultimately it was their bullets that created most damage since each bullet would bounce off the aircraft and create crippling shrapnel
 The flight attendant at the 3L door decided it was time to take action and opened the door and although the slide did not deploy several passengers jumped down the 15 ft to the Tarmac, including crew
 The passenger that was near 3R had read the page the flight attendant earlier gave him and was able to successfully open that door
 It was the only door opened to have the slide deploy
 Ultimately this slide allowed for more passengers to evacuate safely and without injuries
 Neerja Bhanot assisted a number of passengers to escape from the flight, then she laid down her life shielding three children from the bullets fired by the terrorists
 Twenty passengers were killed and over a hundred were injured, but many escaped the ordeal including Michael Thexton, who came close to death a few hours before and returned to the U
