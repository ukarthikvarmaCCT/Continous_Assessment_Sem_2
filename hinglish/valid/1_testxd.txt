is sahitya kaa bahu bhaag yadhyapi jaindharm vishyak he, tathaapi usamen tatkaaleen lokajeevan aisa pratibimbit he jaisaa anyatra durlabh he
 It shows important historical and political, political, economic, social etc
, which are yet to be properly evaluated in Indian history
 bhashaaon ke atirikt desh ke dharmik, darshanik va naitik vikaas kii parampara or uski gutthiyon ko spashtataa se samajhane main is sahitya se bahumoolya sahaayta mil sakati he
 This important literature has not yet been fully published
 jitna bhaag prakashit hua he uskaa bhi samalochanatmak reeti se sampadan bahut kam hua he vaigyanik tathaa tulanaatmak adhyayan bhi bahut shesh he
 Konkani is spoken in Goa, southern part of Maharashtra, northern part of Karnataka, some areas of Kerala
 bhashaayi taur par yah 'arya' bhashaa parivaar se sambandhit he or marathi se iskaa kaaphi nikat kaa sambandh he
 Politically, this language has had to struggle a lot with the Marathi language for its identity
 ab bhartiya samvidhan ke tahat konkani ko aathvin anusuchee main sthaan praapt he
 In 1987, Konkani was given the official language status of Marathi in Goa, but could not be implemented till date due to disagreement on the script
 konkani anek lipiyon main likhi jaati rahi he; jaise - devanagari, kannada, malayalam or roman
 After the state status of Goa, Konkani has been declared the official language of the Dawanagari script
 bharat ke pashchimi tat sthit konkan pradesh main prachlit boliyon ko saamanyat: konkani kehete he
 As a result of historical and cultural connections, the language spoken in this region has three forms - govavala pradesh anek shatee tak portugal ke adheen tha
 There the Portuguese forced the people to convert with force, and tried to disintegrate their original cultural form
 in sab ke baavjood logon ne apni maatrubhaasha kaa parityag nahin kiya
 On the contrary, for their sermon, Christian priests made their knots in the dialect there
 dharmantarit hue nae isai praaia: ashikshit log the
 The Portuguese priests took the shelter of Konkani to convince them of Christianity
 pracheen kaal main goa se sashti tak ke bhubhag main jo boli boli jaati thi use hi log vishuddh konkani maanate the or use gomantki naam se pukaarte the tathaapi solahavin shatee tak uske liye koi vishisht naam rudh nahin tha
 The Portuguese gave and called him the same name as he understood
 1553 i
 ke jesuit padariyon ke aalekhon main use kanari naam diya gaya he
 In the 17th century, Pastor Stephens wrote a book called Dautrin Christianity
 usamen unka kahana tha ki use unhone kanari main likhaa he or gomantki boli kaa jo vyakaran unhone taiyaar kiya use unhone ‘kanari bhashaa kaa vyakaran’ naam diya
 This Kanari word is not even related to Kannada
 varan samajha jaataa he ki samudr ke kinare kii bhashaa hone ke kaaran hi use kanari kaha gaya
 The traveler named Tom Pirish, in his book 'sum Oriental', which was written in 1515 AD, has given the name of the dialect of Goa as Konkoni
 1658 main jesuit padri migled almaid ne bhi gomantaki ke liye 'konkani' shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 Now this word is often used for the language of the entire Konkan region
 kuch log ise marathi kii upbhasha maanate hai to kuch kannada kii
 Some other linguists call it a rich language independent of the Aryans
 satrahavin shatee se purv is bhashaa kaa koi likhit sahitya uplabdh nahin he
 The literary use of this language is attributed to Christian missionaries
 padri stiphs kii pustak dautrin christaan is bhashaa kii pratham pustak he jo 1622 i
 main likhi gai thi
 After that, in 1640 AD, he wrote its grammar in the Portuguese language under the name 'arti the Lingwa Kanari'
 isse purv 1563 i
 ke aasapaas kisi sthaneey dharmantarit nivasee dwaara is bhashaa kaa kosh taiyaar hua or isai dharm ke anek granth likhe gaye
 As a result of Portuguese rule, the pace of literature production was very slow, but now this language has taken the form of a rich literature language
 lokkatha, loakgeet, lokanaty to sangrihith hue hi hai, aadhunik naatak or ekanki kii rachana bhi hui he
 Compositions have also been started in other genres
 bhartiya darshan main pramaan use kehete hai jo satya gyaan karne main sahaayta kare
 That is, the thing that gives accurate knowledge of something else
 pramaan nyaay kaa mukhya vishay he
 The name 'prama' is of true knowledge
 yatharth gyaan kaa jo karan ho arthath jiske dwaara yatharth gyaan ho use pramaan kehete hai
 Gautama considered four proofs - direct, conjecture, subhuman and word
 'yatharth anubhav' ko 'prama' kehete hai
 'smriti' and 'doubt' etc
 are not considered as 'prama'
 atev agyaat tatva ke arthgyan ko 'prama' kaha he
 Karana is the 'proof' that generates knowledge of this non-existent meaning
 isi ko shastradipika main kaha he-- The knowledge of an object is direct by its association with the senses
 ling or lingi donon ke pratyaksh gyaan se utpann gyaan ko anumaan kehete hai
 The proof of knowledge of another thing by analogy with a known object is called Upaman
 jaise, gaay ke sadrush hi nil gaay hoti he
 The word of a person who is an Aapat or confidant is called word proof
 in chaar pramaanon ke atirikt mimasak, vedanti or puranic chaar prakaar ke or pramaan maanate hai—aitihya, arthapatti, sambhav or anuplabdhi yaa abhaav
 What is known only by tradition, the proof with which it is believed is called the historical proof
 jis baat se bina kisi dekhi yaa suni baat ke arth main aapatti aati ho uske liye arthapatti pramaan hai
 Like, obese Devadatta does not eat by day, knowing that Devadatta eats at night because one cannot become fat without eating
 vyapak ke bheetar vyapya—angi ke bheetar ang—kaa hona jis pramaan se siddh hota he use sambhav pramaan kehete hai
 For example, the presence of stray inside the ser
 kisi vastu kaa na hona jisase siddh hota he vah abhaav pramaan he
 As the rats are sitting out, the cat is not here
 par naiyayik in chaaron ko alag pramaan nahin maanate, apane chaar pramaanon ke antargat maanate hai
 The number of evidences in different sects of Indian philosophy varies
 kin-kin darshanon main koun-koun pramaan gruhit hue hai yah neeche diya jaataa he- Out of these, the coincidence form of soul, mind and sense, which is the reason and proof of knowledge, is the same
 vastu ke saath indriya- sanyog hone se jo uskaa gyaan hota he usee ko 'pratyaksh' kehete hai
 This proof is considered to be the best
 gautam ne nyayasutra main kaha he ki indriya ke dwaara kisi padaarth kaa jo gyaan hota he, vahi pratyaksh he
 For example, if we see a fire burning in front of us or if we experience its temperature, then it is a clear proof that 'the fire is burning'
 is gyaan main padaarth or indriya kaa pratyaksh sambandh hona chahie
 If someone says that 'that book is old' then it is not a direct proof; Because the knowledge it contains is only through words, not by matter, so it will go under word-proof
 par yadi vahi kitaab hamaare saamne aa jaay or maili kuchaili yaa fatty hui dikhaai de to hamen is baat kaa avashya pratyaksh gyaan ho jaayga ki 'yah kitaab puraani he'
 Direct knowledge is not through the words of someone, hence it is called 'non-textual'
 pratyaksh ko avyabhichaari isaliye kehete hai ki uske dwaara jo vastu jaisi hoti he uskaa vaisaa hi gyaan hota he
 Some Naiyayiks consider this knowledge to be the only proof
 unke mat se 'pratyaksh pramaan' indriya he, indriya se utpann gyaan 'pratyaksh gyaan' he
 But the intention of the sutrakara from the post of non-text is clear that the unbiased knowledge of the object is the only direct evidence
 naveen granthkaar donon maton ko milakar kehete hai ki pratyaksh gyaan ke karan teen hai In the first stage, when there is only sense, then the result of that will be the direct knowledge that comes before the first manifestation of a substance
 jaise, vah saamne koi cheez dikhaai detii he
 This knowledge is called 'alternative knowledge'
 duusari avasthaa main yah jaan padataa he ki jo cheez saamne he, vah pustak he
 This 'alternative knowledge' happened
 is gyaan kaa kaaran indriya kaa sambandh he
 When knowledge arises from the relation of the senses, then the knowledge that this book is good or bad is direct knowledge
 yah pratyaksh gyaan 6 prakaar kaa hota he - With regard to direct, knowledge is called inference
 jaise, hamane baraabar dekha he ki jahaan dhuaan rahata he vahaan aag rahati he
 This is called naiviyak 'vyapti gyan' which is the first step of inference
 hamane kahin dhooaan dekha jo aag ki jis dhuen ke saath sadaa hamane aag dekhi he vah yahan hai
 In contrast, we have the knowledge or inference that 'here is fire'
 apane samajhane ke liye to upyukt teen khand kaaphi he par naiyayikon kaa kaary he duusare ke man main gyaan karana, isse ve anumaan ke paanch khand karte hai jo 'avyav' kehalaate hai
 So this is how the whole form of conjecture happened - there is fire here
 kyoki yahan dhooaan he 
 Where there is smoke, there is fire, 'like in the kitchen'
 yahan par dhooaan he 
 That is why there is fire here
 saadharantah in paanch avyavon se yukt vaakya ko nyaay kehete hai
 It is not considered necessary for the new naiveik to believe these five elements
 ve pramaan ke liye pratigya, hetu or drushtaant inhen teenon ko kaaphi samajhate hai
 Mimansak and Vedanti also consider these three
 buddha naiyayik do hi maanate hai, pratigya or hetu
 'wicked for' is called a fallacy, but Gautama has proved it by considering it as a separate substance, not under evidence
 isi prakaar chal, jati, nigrahasthaan ityadi bhi vastav main hetudosh hi kahe ja sakate hai
 Only a thorough consideration of the cause can cause all the defects of inference to be captured and it can be known whether the inference is correct or not
 gautam kaa teesraa pramaan 'upmaan' he
 The proof that knowledge of a thing is not known by analogy with a known object is the same
 jaise, nilgai gaay ke sadrush hoti he
 On hearing this from someone's mouth, when we see the Nilgai in the forest, then we become aware that 'it is Nilgai'
 isse prathit hua ki kisi vastu kaa uske naam ke saath sambandh hi upamiti gyaan kaa vishay he
 Vaishasic and Buddhist do not consider the naamic subhuman as separate evidence, only under direct and word proof
 ve kehete hai ki 'go ke sadrush gavay hota he' yah shabd yaa aagam gyaan he kyonki yah aapt yaa vishwaasapaatr manushya kai kahe hue shabd dwaara hua phir iske uparaant yah gyaan kri 'yah jantu jo ham dekhte hai go ke sadrush he' yah pratyaksh gyaan hua
 The answer is given by the naamiyya that even this knowledge was only word and direct, but in contrast, the knowledge that 'this animal's name is lost' is neither direct, nor conjecture, nor word, it is the same
 upmaan ko kai nae darshanikon ne is prakaar anumaan kai antargat kiya he
 They say that 'this animal's name is Gavay', 'because it is similar to Go', those who resemble Gau are named Gavay
 par iskaa uttar yah he ki 'jo jo jantu go ke sadrishy hote hai ve gavay hai' yah baat man main nahin aati, man main keval itnaa hi aata hai ki 'maine achche aadmi ke munh se suna he ki gavay gaay ke sadrush hota he ?' The fourth proof is the word
 sutara main likhaa he ki aptopadesh arthath aapt purush kaa vaakya shabdpraman he
 The commentator has shown the symptom of Aaptapurusha, that the person who is interviewed, as seen and heard is exactly what he says, whether he is an Aath, whether it is Arya or Mlechha
 gautam ne aptopadesh ke do bhed kiye hai— drushtaarth or adrushtaarth
 It is known as the manifestation which tells the known things directly and the person who tells the things known only by inference
 isapar bhashya karte hue vatsyan ne kaha he ki is prakaar loukik or rishi— vaakya kaa vibhaag ho jaataa he arthath adrushtaarth me keval vedavaky hi pramaan koti main mana ja saktaa he
 The Vedas are divineized by the opinion of the Nyayikis, so their sentences are always true and reliable but only the proverbial sentence can be considered true
 jab unka kahanevaala pramanik mana jaay
 In the sutras, many doubts have been resolved regarding the authenticity of Veda
 mimasak ishwar ko nahin maanate par ve bhi veda ko apaurushey or nity maanate hai
 Regularly, Mimamsak considers only the word and explains the regular relation of word and meaning
 par naiyayik shabd kaa arth ke saath koi nity sambandh nahin maanate
 There is a lot of difference in what the meaning of the sentence is
 mimasakon ke mat se niyog yaa prerana hi vaakyarth he—arthath 'aisa karo', 'aisa na karo' yahi baat sab vaakyon se kahi jaati he chaahe saaf saaf chaahe aise arthvaale duusare vaakyon se sambandh dwaara
 But the meaning derived from the relationship of many positions by the opinion of the inmates is the meaning of the sentence
 parantu vaakya main jo pad hote hai vaakyarth ke mul kaaran ve hi hai
 In the Nyayamanjari, there are two types of Shakti in the verse - first the abhidhatri shakti whereby one verse makes sense of its meaning and the other means the power which informs the meaning of the relation of many verses
 shakti ke atirikt lakshana bhi naiyayikon ne maani he
 Figuratives have also considered the third instinct euphemistic, but the naivikas do not consider it a separate instinct
 sutara ke anusaar jin kai aksharon ke ant main vibhakti ho ve hi pad hai or vibhaktiyaan do prakaar kii hoti hai—naam vibhakti or aakhyaat vibhakti
 In this way, only two types of designation are considered, nominal names and famous
 avyay pad ko bhashyakaar ne naam ke hi antargat siddh kiya he
 Only four of the above proofs are considered in justice
 mimasak or vedanti arthapatti, aitihya, sambhav or abhaav ye chaar or pramaan kehete hai
 The Nyayikas consider these four under their four evidences
 drusht yaa shrut vishay kii upapatti jis arth ke bina na ho, us arth ke gyaan ko 'arthapatti' kehete hai
 Like - Devadatta does not eat anything during the day, yet is very fat '
 is vaakya main 'na khaanaa tathaapi motaa hona' in donon kathanon main samanvay kii upapatti nahin hoti
 Hence, it is imagined to 'eat at night' for subsistence
 is kathan se yah spasht ho gaya ki 'yadhyapi din main vah nahin khaataa, parantu raatri main khaataa he'
 Therefore Devdutt is fat
 yahan par pratham vaakya main upapatti laane ke liye, 'raatri main khaataa he' yah kalpana swayan kii jaati he
 This is called 'arthapatti'
 yah do prakaar kii he--'drushtaarthapatti', jaise --upar ke udhaaharan main, tathaa 'shrutarthapatti' 
 It is heard that Devdutt, who is alive, is not in the house
 is se 'devdatt kahin or sthaan main he' isaki kalpana karnaa 'arthapatti' he
 Otherwise, 'living and not living at home' cannot be coordinated in these two things
 prabhakar kaa mat he ki kisi bhi pramaan se gyaat vishay kii upapatti ke liye 'arthapatti' ho sakati he, keval drusht or shrut hi se nahin
 This is not generally proved by direct evidence, ie, a different 'proof' of the name of 'arthapatti' is considered as Mimansak
 abhavpramaan -- pratyaksh aadi pramaanon ke dwaara jab kisi vastu kaa gyaan nahin hota, tab 'vah vastu nahin he' is prakaar us vastu ke 'abhaav' kaa gyaan hamen hota he
 Knowledge of this 'absence' cannot be done through senses, etc
, because senses 'senses' are with substances
 atev 'anuplabdhi', yaa 'abhaav' naam ke ek aise swatantra pramaan ko mimasak maanate hai, jiske dwaara kisi vastu ke 'abhaav' kaa gyaan ho
 This is a simple opinion of the minders
 kintu prabhakar ise nahin sweekaar karte
 His statement is that all the 'proofs' are there, each has its own independent 'theorem', but none of the 'lack' of evidence is its 'subject'
 jaise--'is bhoomi par ghat nahin he', is gyaan main yadi vahaan ghat hota, to bhootal ke samaan uskaa bhi gyaan hota, kintu aisa nahin he
 Then we see 'land only', which we have direct knowledge of
 vastut: 'abhaav' kaa apana swaroop to kuch bhi nahi he
 Wherever he lives, he is said to have the same basis
 isliye yatharth main bhootal ke gyaan ke atirikt 'ghat nahin he' is prakaar kaa gyaan hota hi nahin
 Hence 'absence' is the tribunal's form
 is kaa pruthak astitv nahin he
 Kumaril has discussed 'possible'
 jaise--'ek ser doodh main aadha ser doodh to avashya he'; arthath ek ser hone main sandeh ho saktaa he, kintu uske aadha ser hone main to koi bhi sandeh nahin ho saktaa
 It is believed by the 'mythologists' that the name of 'sambhav' has been accepted
 kumaril ne is 'anumaan' ke antargat mana he
 'etihya' is also mentioned by Kumaril
 jaise 'is vat ke vriksh par bhoot rahata he'
 Old people have been saying this
 at: yah bhi ek swatantra pramaan he
 But the truth of this statement cannot be decided, hence it is not proof
 yadi pramaan he to yah 'aagam' ke antarbhoot he
 But like the other mentors, Kumaril did not accept these two
 'pratibha' arthath 'pratibhagyaan' sadaiv satya nahin hota, atev ise bhi mimasak log pramaan ke rup main nahin sweekaar karte
 It may be clear from the above description that proof is the main subject of jurisprudence
 isi se 'pramanpraveen', 'pramankushal' aadi shabdon kaa vyavhaar naiyayik yaa taarkik ke liye hota he
 The subject of proof is called a theorem
 aise vishay nyaay ke antargat baarah ginaae gaye hai— It should not be understood from this list that there can be no more theorems than these items
 pramaan ke dwaara bahut si baaten siddh kii jaati hai
 But Gautama in his sutras has considered those things, whose knowledge leads to the attainment of class or salvation
 nyaay main ichha, dwesh, praytn, sukh dukh or gyaan ye aatma ke ling kahe gaye hai, yadhyapi sharir, indriya or man se aatma pruthak maani gai he
 Even in Vaisheshika, desire, malice, sadness etc
 are called the sex of the soul
 sharir, indriya or man se aatma ke pruthak hone ke hetu gautam ne die hai
 Like the Vedantis, the naamayikas do not believe in one soul, many believe
 sankhyavaale bhi anek purush maanate hai par ve purush ko akarta or abhokta, sakshi vaa drashtaa maatr maanate hai
 The naamayikas consider the soul as doer, bhakta etc
 sansar ko rachnewali aatma hi ishwar he
 Just like the soul in justice, in God also the number, magnitude, separability, coincidence, department, desire, effort of intellect are considered these qualities, but by doing routine
 nyaayamanjari main likhaa he ki dukh, dwesh or sanskaar ko chhod or sab aatma ke gun ishwar main hai
 Many people believe that the body is made up of five ghosts, but in justice, the body has been considered to be only from the atoms of the earth
 cheshtaa, indriya or arth ke aashray ko sharir kehete hai
 The business of trying to get the happiness with which you are happy and to remove the suffering which is there
 atah sharir kaa jo lakshan kiya gaya he uske antargat vrikshon kaa sharir bhi aa jaataa he
 But Vachaspati Mishra has said that this symptom does not occur in the tree body, it should only understand the intent of the human body
 shankar mishra ne vaisheshik sutropaskaar main kaha he ki vrikshon ko sharir he par usamen cheshtaa or indriyaan spasht nahin dikhaai padatin isse use sharir nahin kah sakate
 The body is produced according to the deeds done in the previous birth
 paanch bhuton se paanchon indriyon kii utpatti kahi gai he
 The smell is absorbed by the olfactory, it is made of earth
 rasna jal se bani he kyoki ras jal kaa hi gun he
 Eye is made of Tej as the form is the property of Tej
 tvak vaayu se bana he kyonki sparsh vaayu kaa gun he
 Srotra is made of sky because the word is a quality of sky
 baudhon ke mat se sharir main indriyon ke jo pratyaksh golak dekhe jate hai unheen ko indriyaan kehete hai
 ; But the organs which are seen by the opinions of the inmates are just the installations of the senses, not the senses
 indriyon kaa gyaan indriyon dwaara nahin ho saktaa
 Some people consider the same twisted senses
 nyaay main unke mat kaa khandan karke indriyon kaa nanaatv sthapit kiya gaya he
 In Sankhya, five karmadriyas and eleven senses with mind are considered
 nyaay main karmendriyaan nahin maani gai hai par man ek karan or anurup mana gaya he
 If the mind was not subtle, then it would have been possible to have simultaneous knowledge, that is, by coincidence of several senses together in a moment, they would have knowledge of all their subjects simultaneously
 par naiyayik aisa nahin maanate
 Smell, juice, form, touch and words are the qualities of the five ghosts and the meaning or subject of the senses
 nyaay main buddhi ko gyaan yaa uplabdhi kaa hi doosraa naam kaha he
 Wisdom in Sankhya is said to be eternal, but justice is eternal
 vaisheshik ke samaan nyaay bhi parmanuwaadi he arthath parmaanuon ke yoga se sristi maanata he
 With respect to the theorems, the views of justice and Vaiseshika are often the same, in this philosophy both views are called justice
 vatsyayan ne bhi bhashya main kah diya he ki jin baton ko vistaar-bhay se gautam ne sutron main nahin kaha he unhen vaisheshik se grahan karnaa chahie
 From what has been written above, it must have been revealed that Gautama's justice is not only a scripture that determines the rules of thought or logic, but also a philosophy that considers theorems
 paashchaatya laajik se yahi isamen bhed hai
 Logic is not taken under philosophy, but justice is philosophy
 yah avashya he ki nyaay main pramaan yaa tark kii pariksha vishesh rup se hui he
 'jurisprudence' is called the most difficult subject in jurisprudence and epistemology
 mithila main vidwanmandali main prasiddh he ki 14veen sadi main ek samay ek bahut bade vidvan or kavi kisi anya praant se mithila ke maharaj kii sabha main aaye

 Maharashtri Prakrit is the name of the Prakrit style that became especially prevalent in the state of Maharashtra in the medieval period
 pracheen praakrit vyakaranon main - jaise chandkrit prakritlakshan, vararuchi krit prakritprakash, hemchandra krit praakrit vyakaran evam trivikram, shubhachandra aadi ke vyakaranon main - maharashtri kaa namollekh nahin paaya jaataa
 The earliest mention of this name is in the penalized poetry, where it is said that "maharashtrians are linguistic great" Prakrit Vidu, Sagar: Suktiratnanam, Sethubandhi, Yanmayam
 " arthath maharashtra pradesh ashrith bhashaa prakrusht praakrit maani gai, kyonki usamen sukhtiyon ke sagar sethubandhadi kaavyon kii rachana hui

 jaise makar uu fir, nagar uu fir, nichul uu niul, parijan uu parshan, niyam uu nium, ityadi
 Linguistics-scholars are of the opinion that in Prakrit language, this method of omitting the letters was gradually introduced

 On his return to Nagpur in 1915, he became active in the Congress and later became the secretary of the Vidarbha Provincial Congress
 When the country level session of the Congress was held in Nagpur in 1920, Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar presented the first proposal in the Congress about the goal of complete independence, then it was not passed
 In 1921, Satyagraha was arrested in the non-cooperation movement of the Congress and he was imprisoned for one year
 By then he had become so popular that veterans like Pandit Motilal Nehru and Hakim Ajmal Kha addressed the gathering organized to welcome him upon his release

 This was the reason that when the anti-salt law movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi in December 1930, he personally handed over the responsibility of the Sangh chief to Dr
 Parapanje along with a dozen of his colleagues, in which he was imprisoned for 9 months
 Similarly, in 1929 when the resolution of the former Swaraj was passed in the Congress session held in Lahore and on 26 January 1930, a call was made to hoist the tricolor across the country, on the instructions of Dr
 Hedgewar Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar in all the Sangh branches on January 30

 Mahadev followed Indian culture and ideas very strictly
 keshav ke maanas-patal par bade bhai mahadev ke vichaaron kaa gaharaa prabhaav tha

 Since Keshav lived in Calcutta at the home of his elder brother Mahadev's friend Shyam Sundar Chakraborty, the local people used to know and address him by the name of Keshav Chakraborty
 unki asaadhaaran yogyata ko maddenjar rakhte hue unhen pehle anushilan samiti kaa saadhaaran sadsy banaaya gaya

 In such a situation, many Hindu leaders went to malabar-kerala to know the state of Kerala and to help the looted Hindus there, among them prominent Hindu Mahasabhai leader of Nagpur, Dr
 Balakrishna Shivram Munje, Dr
 Hedgewar, Arya Samaj leader Swami Shraddhanand ji etc
 After a while there were hindu-muslim riots in Nagpur and many other cities too
 Distracted by such incidents, Dr
 Munje in Nagpur has made some famous Called a meeting of Hindu leaders, including Dr

 However, keeping in mind the unsuccessful revolution and erstwhile circumstances of the first Indian independence struggle, he laid the foundation of a paramilitary organization
 is prakaar 28 / 9 / 1925 ko apane pita-tulya guru dow baalkrishna shivaram munje, unke shishy dow headgavar, shri paranjape or baapu sahib soni ne ek hindu yuvak club kii neenv daali, jiskaa naam kalantar main rashtriya swanyasevak sangh diya gaya l It is worth mentioning here that the basis of this militia was formed - Veer Savarkar's Rashtriya Philosophy book in which it was defined as Hindu - a indus-indus era, Yes India role
 pitrubhu-punyabhu Bhushchev sa Hindu Hindu tradition is shloke ke anusaar “bharat ke vah sabhi log hindu hai jo is desh ko pithrubhumi-punyabhumi maanate hai”l iname sanatani, aryasamaji, jain, buddha, sikh aadi panthon evam dharm vichaar ko maanane vaale va unka aacharan karne vaale samast jan ko hindu ke vyapak daayre main rakhaa gaya tha l musalmaan va isai is paribhaasha main nahin aate the atah unako is milicia main naa lene kaa nirnay liya gaya or keval hinduon ko hi liya janaa tay hua, mukhya mantra tha “aspashtataa nivaaran evam hinduon kaa sainiki kaaran”l To create such a militia, volunteers were recruited, branches were started for one hour each morning and evening
 To make it run smoothly, posts of teacher, head teacher, event etc
 were created
 In these branches it was decided to provide military education to senior volunteers along with exercise, manual labor, education of Hindu nationalism
 Sometimes during the night there were seminars of volunteers, including Maharana Pratap, Veer Shivaji, Guru Govind Singh, Banda Bairagi, Veer Savarkar, Mangal Pandey, Tantya Tope etc
 Biographies were read l used to tell me to read portions of the book written by Savarkar l thode samay baad is milicia ko naam diya gaya rashtriya swanyasevak sangh- jo aar

 dow headgavar ne jis dukhad sthiti ko vyakt kiya, usamen navsarjeet rashtriya swanyasevak sangh or hindu mahasabha ke netritv ke prayaas se- hindu yuvaaon main saahas ke saath yah naaraa gunjane laga “hindusthan hinduon kaa- nahin kisi ke baap kaa” is kathan kii vivechna dow headgavar ne in shabdon main kii:- “many gentlemen do not hesitate to say how Hindusthan is only for Hindus? This is the case of all those who live here
 Sorry that such statement / gentlemen do not know the meaning of the word nation
 Only a piece of land is not called a nation
 The people who have lived in the civilization and tradition since ancient times, a nation is formed by the culture of the same people
 This country has been named Hindusthan because of us
 If other people give it through communication If you want to settle in, then you can definitely settle
 We have never denied them, but we will not get even a single place here for those who come to our house as guests and take a knife on our neck
 l First get this ideology of Sangh right
 ek anya avasar par dow headgavar ne kaha tha “sangh to keval, hindusthan hinduon kaa- is dhyey vaakya ko sachcha kar dikhaanaa chahta he l” duusare deshon ke saamaan, “yah hinduon kaa hone ke kaaran”- is desh main hindu jo kahenge vahi purv disha hogi l yahi ek baat he jo sangh jaanata he, rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ke liye kisi bhi anya pachade main padane kii aavashkata nahin he l” When Veer Savarkar was off sight in Ratnagiri, Dr
 Hedgewar went to meet him there
 tab tak vah vir saavarkar rachit pustak hindutv bhi pard chuke the
 Dr
 Hedgewar was very impressed with the ideas of that book and praised it saying that "veer Savarkar is an ideal person"
 donon kaa vishwaas tha ki jab tak hindu andh vishwaas, puraani roodhiwaadee soch, dharmik aadambaron ko nahin chhodenge tab tak hindu-jateevaad, chhot-achhut, shahari-banavaasi or chhetravaad ityadi main banta rahegaa or jab tak vah sangathit evam ek jute nahin hoga, tab tak vah sansar main apana uchit sthaan nahin le sakegaa
 In 1937, Veer Savarkar's termination ended and after that he could participate in politics

 In 1937, the Hindu Mahasabha was held in Karnavati

 Before criticizing multiculturalism it is important to define the term
 andrew hewood ne bahusamskritwad ke do samgr roopon ke bich fark kiya he : avarnanaatmak or maanak
 "'bahusamskritwad' shabd kaa istemaal vibhinn tareekon se kiya jaataa he, varnanaatmak or maanak donon tarah se
 ek varnanaatmak shabd ke rup main, saanskrithik vividhta ke ullekh ke liye ise liya gaya he
 

as a standard term, multiculturalism is a positive endorsement, even a celebration of communal diversity, which is usually either based on the right of different groups to respect and recognize, or moral and cultural diversity
 k is based on perceived benefits for the wider society
 bahusamskritwad kii aalochana main aksar yah kaha jaataa he kya maitreepurvak sah-astitv vaali samskritiyaan jo ek-duusare ko prabhavit karti hai or tab bhi alag bani rahati hai, tikaoo, vidambnaapurna yaa vaanchhneeya hai
 It has been argued that nation states, which are already synonymous with their own distinct cultural identity, cease to apply multiculturalism which eventually leads to the desegregation of the specific culture of the host countries

 putanam likhte hai, "vividh samudaayon ke log "sthaneey meyar par vishwaas nahin karte, ve sthaneey akhbaar par bharosa nahin karte, ve anya logon par vishwaas nahin karte hai or sansthaanon par bhi bharosa nahin karte hai,"

 athsha sha m ausat laagat unut laagat or / yaa kul laagat ko upadat vatuon k sanyaa se vabhaajat karne par aata he
 This award comes from adding the average fixed cost to the total amount of changeable costs
 Average cost also depends on the time frame
 Average costs affect supply and supply and are the fundamental component of supply and demand
 ausat laagat muy or maang ke loch se or seemaa muy nadhaaran ke kaaran ausat laagat nabar karti he
 The periodic average cost varies for each item that is produced until the static cost is 0 and the variable cost is not constant
 a cost element can be created in which the cost is at y and the demand for the item is at XA
 seemaant laagat va kai baar in aalekh par dakhaae jate ha, jahaan seemaant laagat us kamat ko dashata he jo k sabase aakhar m banaai gai vatu k kamat hoti he
 Marginal cost is the first use of total cost or variable cost
 ek saamaay ausat laagat va you aakaar m hota he yak tay laagat hameshaa upaadan ke puv lagati he or seemaant laagat badhati he yak seemaant upaadakta kam hoti he
 In such a situation, marginal cost of production at one level is below the average cost, hence average cost is lower due to increase in quantity
 ek badhata hua seemaant laagat va, you aakaar ke ausat laagat va ko uske unatam par katata he, iske baad ausat laagat va k dhalaan upar k ore ho jaati he
 Due to increase in quantity of production, marginal cost goes above average cost, hence average cost increases with increasing quantity

 The average long-term average cost is U-shaped, showing increasing rates based on definition, where rates decrease on a negative-haul and positive reduction scale
 agar fam sabhi input makat m ek sah tavanvi he, or is car sabhi input ke t-unut muy fam k kharad ke katane input vaara abhaavat ha, to yah dakhaaya ja saktaa he k upaadan ke ek vashesh tar par, fam paimaane k athyavathaayen ha or yad keval tabhi bade paimaane par raton badhate ha isi tarah, ism paimaane k jatalataayen ha agar or agar yah paimaane par badhane k raton ghatata he, or iske paas na to athyavathaayen ha or na ha paimaane k athyavatha ha | is maamle m, output makat m pun tapadha ke saath lambii avadh ke bazaar santulan m sabhi lambii avadh waal ausat laagat ghatata ke unatam bandu par kaayrat sabhi kampanay ko shamal kayaa jayega | If, however, the firm is not an associate in the input market, then the above arguments are modified
 For example, if certain levels of output level increase in mass, but the firm is so large in one or more input markets that the purchasing cost of a single input increases the total cost of the input
 There may be inequalities of scale in that range of production levels
 iske vaparat, yad fam kasi input ke thok dacount t karne m sam he, to uske upaadan ke kuch tar m paimaane k athyavathaayen ho sakati ha, bhale ha us output raj m upaadan m garavat ghat gai ho
 In some industries, LRAC is always decreasing
 This means that there is a cost benefit to the largest firm and the industry becomes a truly monopolistic entity, and is therefore called a natural monopoly
 ve kritak laagat ke sambandh m uch puunjigat laagat vaale uyog m kritak ekaadhakaar vaymaan ha, jaise k pani k aaput or bajal aaput | The long-term average cost is the unit cost of producing a specific output when all inputs are variables
 yavahaar dharna yah he k fam un navitay ke sangyojan ko chun legaa, jo unatam sambhav laagat par vaanchaat maa kaa upaadan karegaa
 When the average cost is decreasing, the marginal cost is less than the average cost
 jab ausat laagat bad rah he, to seemaant laagat ausat laagat se adhak he, jab ausat laagat na badhati he or na ha garti he, seemaant laagat ausat laagat ke baraabar hoti he
 Other special case effects for average cost and marginal cost are seen: 1
 ausat fad cott va oonchaai se shu hoti he or upaadan m badhotar ke pa m narantar garavat jaar karata he
 2
 Average variable cost and average cost and marginal cost and start from altitude, reach the minimum mark, then increase rapidly and continuously
 3
ausat tay laagat k avatha shoe pa se shoe par pahunchati he
 The average variable cost is not at all the same or higher as the average cost factor, because of the average expected cost, at all levels of the production of the positive average; But the average variable cost and, from below, the average cost and strive to reach

 yah sampadaayen, naahin paryaapt rupase sarkari sampatti he, naa shaasha kii nijee sanvatti he
 Because all these are the assets of the ruler, but they are managed and administered by semi-independent publicly acquired bodies, and the sovereign has no privately minimal or minimal control or participation in their management
 atah inhen "samprabhu kii saarvajanik sampatti" kaha ja saktaa he
 The assets of the Mukutia estates are managed by the guardian of a Crown Estate Commissioner, who is competent to exercise "ownership rights" to that particular property
 in viraasati sampattiyon dwaara utpann rajasav ko shaasha dwaara unki shahi shaan kii sarkaar ke adhikaar main rakhaa gaya he
 Hence, all the revenue generated from them goes directly to the government fund

 At present, the amount of money received from Mukutia Estates is more than that given to the Civil List or other grants to the Adhrat
 is prakaar 2007-08 ke bich crown esteton ne rajkosh main £200 million kii vruddhi karwaai, jabaki sansad dwaara 40 lakh pound kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha
 Thus, with a wealth of 7
3 billion pounds, crown assets are one of the largest landowners in Britain, these sari assets are placed under trust and the sovereign cannot deal with them voluntarily
 2012 ke baad se sansadeey anudaan or naagarik suchi ko mila kar ek sankukt samprabhu anudaan se badal diya gaya he

 Direct currents in armature drivers of motors are carried by Burroughs
 ye burush, vastut: armechar se sambhddha dikparivartak par aropit hote hai or sambharan se sambhddha hote hai
 Are associated with the coils generating magnetic fields
 chumbakeey kshetra utpann karanevaale kundalanon ko saamanyat: kshetra kundali kehete hai
 These coils may be associated with the armature coil in series or associated in parallel or in parallel
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki unke kuch kundalan shrenee main hon or kuch samaantar main
 Based on this combination of field coils, three different types of direct current motors are obtained - shrenee motor main jo dhara armechar main se hokar pravaahit hoti he, vahi kshetra kundali main bhi pravaahit hoti he
 Hence, there is very little coil of coarse wire in its field coil
 shant motor main purna dhara kaa kuch ansh hi kshetra kundali main hokar bahata he, jo uske aarpaar boltata tathaa kundalan ke pratirodh par nirbhar karata he
 Therefore, in this region the coil has very high coil of very thin wire, due to which the resistance of this coil is usually several hundred ohms
 vibhinn prarupon ke disht dhara motaron ke lakshan bhi bahut bhinn bhinn hote hai or unheen ke anusaar inkaa prayog bhi bhinn bhinn prayojanon ke liye hota he
 Shunt motors run at almost constant speed and their speed variance does not increase with the load

 They are very useful for trams, elevators, cranes etc
 kisi bhaar ko chalan main laane se pehle adhik bal lagaana padataa he, par jab vah chalane lagata he tab utane bal kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 Therefore class motors are ideal for these applications and are widely used
