 saamanyat: audyogic vaastu ke antargat aisi imaaraten tathaa kaarkaane aate hai jahaan vastuon kaa praarambhik nirmaan, utpaadan, sangrah or kray-vikray hota he
 Such buildings are: Kal-factory, mill, electric power center, oil treatment center, demonstration room, non-collector and warehouse etc
 mulat: in imaaraton kaa nirmaan vyaavhaarik dhang par hona chahie, arthath inkaa dhaanchaa aisa ho jisase kam se kam kharch se, sthaan, saamagree or dhan kaa apvyay bachaate tathaa kaarykushalta ko akshunn rakhte hue ye us vishisht uddeshy ko siddh kar saken jiske liye inkaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 It is necessary to take full care of the people who use these buildings and factories to get adequate security and more comfort
 aakaar prakaar main bhi in imaaraton ko susantulit, manoram or bhavy hona chahie
 Initially, industrial buildings in India were mainly made of timber, brick and stone and were single-storey
 shaharon main, jahaan bhoomi kaa mulya apekshaakrit bahut adhik hota tha, ye imaaraten dumanjili banati thim
 The buildings with three or more storeys were very few
 lambii dharanon ke na mil sakane ke kaaran chat ke neeche paas-paas khambhe rakhane padate the jisase imaarat ke bheetar kaa ek bada bhaag kisi kaam main na aa paata tha
 Later, when iron became available, the pillars were made of steel, shackles and poles so that the poles could be kept far away and more space was found inside the factory for work
 saath hi ispaat ke payon par khadey kiye gaye kai manzil ke bhawanon kaa nirmaan bhi sambhav ho sakaa
 The development of alloys of reinforced cement concrete, good quality steel and aluminum made good progress in the design, construction and decoration of industrial buildings
 telephone, lift tathaa swachaalit sanvahan se is pragati main or tivrata ai
 When choosing an appropriate location for construction of industrial buildings, it is necessary to pay attention to the following points: Electric power and water are available cheap and in sufficient quantity
 aavashyak maatra or santoshjanak rup main shram sulabh ho
 There should be sea or navigable river, rail line and paved road to get raw material and necessary equipment at reasonable expense and convenience and send the goods out
 vyavsaayjanya raddi saamaanon ke uchit vikray kii suvidha ho
 The land should be constructable and the neighborhood should be such that in future it can be possible to expand the industry conveniently and satisfactorily with less expense
 yudhkalin bambaari jaise jokhimon se bachane ke liye yathasambhav janakeern env samrik mahatv ke kshetron ko nahin chunanaa chahie
 The need for location should be carefully considered
 vibhinn ekakon kii rachana badi satarkta se kerani chahie jisase dainik kaarysanchalan main shakti kaa apvyay na ho or na sthaan, saamagree, shram yaa dhan kii barabaadi ho
 Organizing should be simple so that the efficiency of the workers working in the establishment can be increased maximum and they can get maximum comfort
 jalwaayu kii sthiti, vayupravah kii disha, varsha kii maatra aadi par bhi uchit dhyaan dena aavashyak he
 Buildings should be single-storey or multiple storey, it depends on the industry's own requirements, relative price of land, land condition and area etc
 kai manjilonvali imaaraton main agni ke niyantran ke liye swachaalit vyavastha honi chahie jisase bime kaa kharch kam ho
 Proper management of escape is also necessary in times of fire and crisis
 lift or swachaalit sopanon kii vyavastha bhi ho sake to acha he
 It is necessary to keep in mind that every department can be expanded in due time and with less expenditure and there is no loss in production
 pratishthan ke vistaar ke anuroop jalpan evam bhojangrih, vishramkaksh, shauchalay, bahumoolya vastuon ko rakhane ke liye surakshit sthaan, chikitsaalay evam kridaangan aadi kalyankari suvidhaayen bhi nitant apekshit hai
 In order to make Vastu effective, care should be taken of the size, type, texture, and proportion of the building
 karmchaariyon kii manodasha or maansik vrittiyon par rangon ke aayojan kaa bada prabhaav padataa he, jisase antat: utpaadan ke pariman or achchhai donon prabhavit hote hai
 The walls of the inner walls of the establishment should be light colored or white
 imaaraton main roshni kii paryaapt vyavastha honi chahie jisase nirantar ekarup prakaash mil sake, kintu chakachaundh na utpann ho
 Natural light should be used to its maximum advantage
 raat ke samay kritrim prakaash ke rup main bikharakar aayaa bijli kaa shwet prakaash apekshit hota he
 Often the vascular nodes are the most convenient
 iske liye prakritik or kritrim donon prakaar kii vyavasthaayen kii ja sakati hai
 In establishments like tobacco, medicine and textiles, where heat and humidity control and dust removal are very important, air conditioning also has to be arranged
 audyogic imaaraton kaa nirmaan agnisah hona chahie
 Factories have grown so much in some countries that it has become impossible to build them in cities
 isliye bade kaarkaane shahar se dur banaae jate hai or paas main hi kaaryakartaaon ke liye grih, paathshaala, udyaan, aspataal, bazaar, cinema aadi sabhi vishesh rup se banaae jate hai
 Thus, each factory becomes a small town
 karyaalayon ke liye bhawan bhi audyogic vaastu ke antargat gine jate hai
 There are some such large offices abroad that they are built thirty floors or even higher
 ispaat ke dhaanche ke avishkaar ke pehle aise unche karyaalayon ke nimnatam khand main jagah bilkul nahin bachati thi, kyonki aavashyak dridhtaa ke liye deevaaren badi moti banani padati thim
 For example, the walls of the lowest section of an office 348 feet high were 20 feet thick
 san 1884 main pehali baar aisa bhavana bana jisamen ispaat kaa kankal tha or sab chhaton or saamaan kaa boj isi kankal par tikaa tha
 The walls were very thin in this and their weight was also held on the skeleton
 peeche ispaat ke gardaron ko lavangit karne ke badale welding jodne kaa upyog hone laga
 Then for the desired firmness, very light skeletons were used and very tall buildings started being built
 parantu bahut unche bhawanon main itane alevetaron kii aavashyaktaa padane lagi ki bahut sa upyogi sthaan unheen main lag jaataa tha
 Now this problem has also been solved with the use of automatic elevators
 bhawanon ko agnisah banane ke liye aavashyak he ki ispaat ke garder aadi cement-kancreet main dabe rahen, anyathaa bhawan ke bheetar rakhe samaan ke jalane par ve tapt hokar naram pad jate hai or bhawan gir padataa he
 With the intention of getting more light, sometimes a wall is made of glass bricks
 yadi aisa na bhi kiya jaae to kaanch lagi badi khidakiyon se kaam liya jaataa he
 In skeletal buildings there is no burden on the walls, so it is often possible to fill them with glass
 videshon main bahut se kaarkaanon main diwaar kaa 90 pratishat kaanch hota he; parantu bharat main dhoop se bhi bachanaa rahata he; isliye itnaa kaanch nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 In skeletal buildings, 30 feet and 60 feet of space between the pillars can be easily placed
 hawaii jahaaj ke kaarkaanon main isse bhi bade chauke rakhe jate hai
 a factory built in England after the Second World War has 358 feet and 420 feet squares
 aise bhawanon par pade garder sade nahin, kanchi yaa pulon par prayukt kankalmay garder kii tarah yaa mehrab hote hai
 In the last world war, it also required that industrial buildings should be built quickly
 tab aisi nirmaan reetiyaan nikaali gayi ki varshon kaa kaam saptahon main hone laga
 The success came from the ingredients and details of the authentic measure
 udhaahrant: sab kaarkaanon main vishisht naapon ke kaksh banate the or daravaaje, khidkiyaan aadi vishesh naapon ke or vishesh melon ke hi lagaae jate the

 It is believed that the ancestors of the Apaches entered their south-western habitat area in about 1000 AD

 In philosophy, essence is a property or set of qualities that give originality to a substance or substance, and which it inevitably possesses, and in the absence of which it loses its identity
 saar, tatvamimasaa main, adhiktar baar aatma kaa samanaarthi mana jaataa he, or kuch astitvvaadi ye vaad karte hai ki vyakti astitv main aane ke baad atmaaen or spirits praapt karte hai, ki ve apane jeevankaal main apni atmaaon or spirits ko viksit karte hai
 For Kierkegaard, however, the essence was centered on "nature"
 unke liye, "maanvi prakruti" jaisaa kuch he hi nahin, jo yah nirdhaarit karegaa ki koi maanav kaise bartaav karegaa yaa maanav kya hoga
 First, it comes into existence, and then comes virtue
 kisi bhi tatvamimasak saar, jaise aatma, ko saafe taur par nakaarkar, jyaan-paal sartra ke adhik bhautikwaadi or sanshayi astitvvaad ne is astitvvaadi vichaar ko or badhaayaa, varan yah vaad karke ki saar ke rup main gunon ke saath, sirf astitv hi he
 Therefore, in existential discourse, essence can refer to the physical aspect, or to the quality of a person's released organism, or it depends on the type of existential discourse that it can refer to within the human eternal

 In understanding a person's personality, there is a difference between his religion and nature

 Religion comes from Dhru Dhatu
 yah vah he jo satva ko dhaarit kiye rahata hai
 That is, religion is that which gives integrity to Sattva and holds the basic qualities and identity, form and function of that entity
 dharm nitiparayanata or kartavya ke rup main bhi paribhaashit hota he
 To do righteousness means to be righteous; Doing religion means performing duty

 ek baar jarasandh ke bhay se shrikrishna samudr ke madhya nagari basaakar rahane lage
 Nowadays the name of this city is Dwarikapuri
 dwarikapuri main nivas karne vaale satrajit yadav ne suryanarayan kii aradhana kii
 Then Lord Surya gave him a gem called Syamantaka, which gave him eighty pieces of gold, from his neck
 mani paakar satrajit yadav jab samaaj main gaya to shrikrishna ne us mani ko praapt karne kii ichha vyakt kii
 Satrajit did not give the gem to Shri Krishna and gave it to his brother Prasenjit
 ek din prasenjit ghode par chadhakar shikaar ke liye gaya
 There a lion killed him and took the gem
 richon kaa raja jamvant us singh ko markar mani lekar gupha main chalaa gaya
 When Prasenjit did not return from hunting for several days, Satrajit felt very sad
 usne sochaa, shrikrishna ne hi mani praapt karne ke liye uskaa vadh kar diya hoga
 So, without gathering any kind of information, he preached that Shri Krishna killed Prasenjit and took away the Samantaka gem
 is lok-ninda ke nivaaran ke liye shrikrishna bahut se logon ke saath prasenjit ko dhundne van main gaye
 There, he got the symbols to kill Prasenjit by a lion and kill the lion by bear
 rich ke pairon kii khoj karte-karte ve jamvant kii gupha par pahunche or gupha ke bheetar chale gaye
 There he saw that the daughter of Jamwant is playing with that gem
 shrikrishna ko dekhte hi jamvant yuddh ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 War broke out
 gupha ke baahar shrikrishna ke saathiyon ne unki saat din tak pratiksha kii
 Then, repenting that they had died, they returned to Dwarikapuri
 idhar ikkis din tak lagaataar yuddh karne par bhi jamvant shrikrishna ko parajeet na kar sakaa
 Then he thought, is this avatar for which i got the blessing of Ramchandraji
 yah pushti hone par usne apni kanya kaa vivaah shrikrishna ke saath kar diya or mani dahej main de di
 When Shri Krishna came back with the gem, Satrajit was very ashamed of his actions
 is lajja se mukt hone ke liye usne bhi apni putree kaa vivaah shrikrishna ke saath kar diya
 1018 is a simple year of Gregory calendar
 bansuri kashtha vaadya parivaar kaa ek sangeet upkaran he
 Unlike wooden instruments with reeds, the flute is an aerophone or reeded wind instrument that produces sound by the flow of air across a hole
 hornbostal-saifus ke upkaran vargeekaran ke anusaar, bansuri ko teevr-aghat arophone ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 The fluteist is referred to as a flute player, a flautist, a flutist, or sometimes a flutter
 bansuri purvakaleen gyaat sangeet upkarnon main se ek he
 Several flutes dating to around 40,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Alb region of Germany
 yah bansuriyaan darshaati hai ki europe main ek viksit sangeet parampara aadhunik maanav kii upasthiti ke praarambhik kaal se hi astitv main he
 The oldest flute discovered could be a piece of bone of a young bear living in a cave, with two to four holes, found in Divje Beb, Slovenia and is around 43,000 years old
 haalanki, is tathy kii pramanikta aksar vivaadit rahati he
 In 2008 another flute at least 35,000 years old was found in the Hohl Fels cavity near Ulm, Germany
 is paanch chhed vaali bansuri main ek ve-aakaar kaa mukhpatr he or yah ek giddh ke pankh kii haddi se bani he
 In August 2009, researchers involved in the search officially published their findings in a journal called "nature"
 yah khoj itihaas main kisi bhi vaadya yantra kii sabase puraani maanya khoj bhi he
 The flute, one of the many instruments found, was found in front of the Hohl Phels Venus and a short distance from the oldest known human engravings in the cave of the Hohl Fells
 khoj kii ghoshnaa par, vaigyanikon ne suzav diya ki "jab aadhunik maanav ne europe ko upinveshit shat kiya tha, khoj us samay kii ek sutasthapit sangeet parampara kii upasthiti ko pradarshit karti he"
 vaigyanikon ne yah suzav bhi diya he ki, bansuri kii khoj nienderthels or praarambhik aadhunik maanav "ke bich sambhawatah vyavhaarik or srujanaatmak khadi" ko samajhane main sahaayta bhi kar sakati he
 Made from a tooth of memoth, an 18
7 cm long, three-pronged flute was discovered in 2004 and two other swan bones made from excavations a decade earlier are among the oldest known instruments

 The oldest popular cross-flute is a Chi flute found in the tomb of Jeng's Marquis Yi at the Suizhou site in Hubei Province, China

 It is made of lacquered bamboo with closed ends and its five holes are not at the top but at the other end
 parampara ke anusaar, kanceyucius ke dwaara sankalit evam sampadit shi jing main chi bansuri kaa varnan he
 In Bible Genesis 4:21 Jubal is described as "the father of all those who play Ugab and Kinnaur"
 purvavarti hebrew shabd kuch vaayu vaadya yantron yaa saamanytah vaayu yantron ko sanderbhit karata he, uttarvarti ek tardaar vaadya yantra yaa saamanytah tardaar vaadyayantra ko sanderbhit karata he
 Therefore, in the Judeo Christian tradition, jubal is considered the inventor of the flute
 pehle ke kuch bansuri tibas se bane hue the
 The flute has always been an essential part of Indian culture and mythology, and the origin of the cross flute is considered in India by some chronicles as early as 1500 BC
 The Indian flute has a detailed description of the cross flute
 jab yantra ke chhidr ke aar-paar vaayu dhara pravaahit kii jaati he, jisase chhidr par vaayu kampan hone ke kaaran bansuri dhwani utpann karata he
 The air across the hole creates a barnoli or siphon that has an effect on the von Karman Vortax Street
 yah bansuri main saamanytah maujuud belanaakaar anunaadi guhika main vaayu ko uttejit karti he
 The player changes the tone of the sound by opening and closing the holes of the instrument, thus it changes the effective length of resonance and its corresponding resonant frequency
 vaayu daab main parivartan ke dwaara evam kisi bhi chhidr ko khole or band kiye bagaiyr aadharbhoot aavriti ke alaava bhi bansuri ko guneet swar par anuwaad ke dwaara vadak swar main bhi parivartan kar saktaa he
 For more sound, the flute will have to use a relatively large resonator, large air stream or large air stream velocity
 Generally the sound of a flute can be increased by increasing its resonant and sound holes
 isliye police kii siti, jo bansuri kaa ek rup he, apane swar main bahut vistrut hoti he evam isiliye pipe argon ek concert bansuri kii tulana main adhik tej aawaaj kaa ho saktaa he: ek bade organ pipe main kuch cubic feet vaayu ho sakati he evam iske dhwani chhidr kuch chaude ho sakate hai, jabaki concert bansuri kii vaayu dhara kii maap ek inch se thodi hi badi hoti he
 The air stream should flow at a proper angle and velocity, otherwise the air in the flute will not vibrate
 In flipped fillets or nozzles, a narrowly formed and installed airway will shrink and the air across the open window will flow to the ramp edge
 In pipe organ, this air flows through a controlled blower
 gaiyr fipil bansuri main vaayu dhara nishchit rup main vadak ke hothon se pravaahit hoti he jise imboshar kaha jaataa he
 This allows the player to have a wider range of voice, sound and voice expression, especially compared to the fipil / tube flutes
 haalanki, isse nausikhie vadak ko recorder jaise nalika bansuriyon kii tulana main antim sire se bajane vaale yaa anuprastha bansuriyon dwaara puri dhwani utpann karne main paryaapt kathinaayee hoti he
 To play transverse and end-flute flutes, more air is required which requires deep breathing and complicates cyclic respiration
 saamanytah gunvattta yaa "dhwani rang", jise swar kehete hai, main parivartan hota he kyonki bansuri kai bhaagon evam gahnataaon main sur utpann kar sakate hai
 Sound-color can be altered or improved by a change in the internal shape of the hole such as a conical tip
 sur ek aavruti he jo ek nimna register purnank gunak he yaa bansuri kaa "aadharbhoot" note he
 In general, the air stream is thin, sharp and less deep flowing across the cavity at the origin of high noise
 dhwani vigyaan nishpaadan evam swar ke prati sheersh jod jyamiti vishesh rup se jatil prathit hoti he, lekin utpaadakon ke madhya kisi vishesh aakaar ko lekar koi sarvasammati nahin he
 The acoustic barrier of the imbosher orifice appears to be the most complex criterion
 dhwani vigyaan baadha ko prabhavit karne vaale jatil karkon main shaamil hai: chimney kii lambaai, chimney kaa vyas evam radi yaa chimney ke ant sire kaa ghumaav tathaa vaadya yantra ke "gale " main koi dizin pratibandh jaisaa ki japani nohakan bansuri main
 In a study, in which professional players were blindfolded, it was found that they could not find any difference in instruments made of different metals
 On hearing blindly, no one could identify the instrument correctly at first and in the second time only the silver instrument could be identified
 The study concludes that "no evidence of wall material having any noticeable effect on the sound tone or kinetic extension produced by the instrument was found"
 Unfortunately, this study does not control for headline design, which is commonly believed to affect tone
 The controlled tone test shows that the mass of the tube produces a change and therefore the tube density and wall thickness will produce changes
 We should also keep in mind the limitations of human ears as compared to electronic sensors for sound recognition
 apane aadharatam rup main bansuri ek khuli nalika ho sakati he jise bottle kii tarah bajaayaa jaataa he
 There are some wide categories of flutes
 zyaadaatar bansuriyon ko sangeetkaar yaa vadak oth ke kinaaron se bajaata he
 However, some flutes, such as Whistle, Jamshorne, Flagiolate, Recorder, Tin Whistle, Tonnet, Fujara, and Okarina, have a tube that sends air to shore
 These are called fipil flut
 fipil, yantra ko ek vishisht dhwani detaa he jo gaiyr-fipil fluton se alag hoti he evam yah yantra vaadan ko aasaan banaata he, lekin is par sangeetkaar yaa vadak kaa niyantran kuch kam hota he
 There is another division between side-played flutes such as Western music Kaval, Danso, Shakuhachi, Anasazi Flute and Quena
 bagal se bajaai jane vaale bansuriyon main nalika ke antim sire se bajaaye jane kii ke sthaan par dhwani utpann karne ke liye nalika ke bagal main chhed hota he
 End flutes should not be interpreted as fipple flutes such as recorders, which are played vertically but have an internal tube that sends air to the end of the sound hole
 bansuri ek yaa donon siron par khule ho sakate hai
 Okarina, Jun, Pan Pipes, Police Whistle and Bosun Whistle are closed at one end
 sire par khuli bansuri jaise ki concert-bansuri evam recorder zyada sureele hote hai atev vadak ke liye bajaane main adhik lochasheel tathaa adhik chatkh dhwani vaale hote hai
 An organ pipe can open or close depending on the desired sound
 bansuriyon ko kuch vibhinn vaayu stroton se bajaayaa ja saktaa he
 Traditional flutes are played by mouth, although some cultures use a flute that is played through the nose
 organ ke flu pipon ko, joki nalika bansuri se dhvanik rup main samaan hote hai, dhaukani yaa pankhons ke dwaara bajaayaa jaataa he
 The Western concert flute is a descendant of the 19th century German flute
 yah ek adhi yaa anuprastha bansuri he joki sheersh par band hoti he
 There is a gaping hole near its top from which the player plays
 bansuri main golakaar dhwani chhidr hote hai joki iske barok purvajon ke anguli chhidr se bade hote hai
 The size and position of the sound hole, the major function, and the use of the finger to generate notes in the expansion of the flute were developed by Theobald Bohm between 1832 and 1847 and his heirs made great improvements in the dynamic expansion and tone of the instrument
 
 kuch parishkaron ke saath western concert bansuri multah boham kii dizin tak hi simit rahe evam boham pranali ke naam se jane jate he

 arthath prati-oxykaarak ve anu hai, jo anya anuon ko oxikaran se bachaate hai yaa anya anuon kii oxikaran prakriya ko dhimaa kar dete hai

 In the automatic oxidation process, the actuators of the chain are free radicals which are very active
 swat: oxikrut honevaale anu main jo sabase nirbal carbon-hydrogen bandha hota he usee ke tuutane se ye mulak banate hai
 Therefore, the presence of a hydrogen atom easily emitted in this type of material is necessary
 iske atirikt usamen ek dwibandh bhi hona chahie jiske saath muktamulak sanyukt ho sake
 Although oxidation reactions are very important for life, they can also be harmful

 Antioxidants themselves are oxidized to these free radicals, which helps to break the chain reaction

 Therefore, there are often antioxidant reducing agents, such as thiol, ascorbic acid or polyphenols, etc
