 The foundation of the first era arose in the nineteenth century, when the contours of colonial modernity and the contradictory shadow of discontent against colonial rule were forming the framework of our public life
 is prakriya ke tahat media do dhruvon main bant gaya
 Part of it turned out to be a supporter of colonial rule, and another part supported those who raised the flag of independence
 rashtrawaad banaam upniveshwaad kaa yah daur 1947 tak chalata rahaa
 Meanwhile, there was a rich tradition of publication of newspapers and magazines in English as well as Indian languages and radio-broadcasting started under British control
 doosraa daur azaadi milane ke saath prarambh hua or assi ke dashak tak chalaa
 During this long period, there was a tremendous increase in the spread and quality of media
 uske vibhinn rup bharat ko aadhunik raashtra-rajya banane ke lakshya ke ird-gird gadhi gayi akhil bhartiya sahmati ko dharti par utaarne kii maha-pariyojna main bhagidaari karte hue dikhaai pade
 TV arrived in this period
 mudrit media mukhyatah nijee kshetra ke haath main, or radio-tivi kii lagaam sarkaar ke haath main rahi
 The nineties marked the beginning of the third phase with the advent of globalization which continues to this day
 yah raashtra-nirmaan or jan-raajnneeti ke prachlit muhaavarey main hue amul-chul parivartan kaa samay tha jiske kaaran media kii shakl-surat or rujhaanon main baari tabdiliyaan aayin
 The government and television channels loosened
 nijee kshetra main choubees ghante chalane vaale upgrahiy tivi channelon or echem radio channelon kaa bahut tezi se prasar hua
 Indian language media overtook English-media in proliferation and popularity due to increasing literacy and continued modernization
 media kaa kul aakaar abhootpurv dhang se badha
 There was a tremendous increase in the number of people using new media technologies
 mahaz das saal ke bheetar-bheetar bharat main bhi lagbhag vahi sthiti ban gayi jise pashchim main ‘mediaswere’ kaha jaataa he
 The first phase of media development in India can be understood by dividing it into three parts
 pandrahavin or solahavin sadi main isai mishanri dharmik sahitya kaa prakaashan karne ke liye bharat main printing press laa chuke the
 The first newspaper of India, Bengal Gazette, was also published by an Englishman James Augustus Hickey on 29 January 1780
 chunki hiki is saptahik ke zariye bharat main british samudaay ke antarvirodhon ko kataaksh bhari bhashaa main vyakt karte the, isliye jaldi hi unhen giraftaatar kar liya gaya or do saal main akhbaar kaa prakaashan band ho gaya
 After Hickey, no British published an attack on colonial interests
 unnisvin sadi ke duusare dashak main kalakatta ke paas shrirampur ke mishnariyon ne or tisare dashak main raja rammohan raay ne saptahik, masik or dwaimasik patr-patrikaon kaa prakaashan prarambh kiya
 Through journalism it was a clash of two perspectives
 shrirampur ke mishanri bhartiya parampara ko nimnatar sabit karte hue isiyat kii shreshthata sthapit karnaa chaahate the, jabaki raja rammohan raay kii bhoomika hindu dharm or bhartiya samaaj ke aantarik aalochak kii thi
 He was critical of those forms of tradition that were not comfortable with modernity
 saath main raja rammohan parampara ke upyogi ayaamon ko isai preranaon se jod kar ek naye dharm kii sthapana kii koshish main bhi lage the
 In this period, the content of media dominated analysis and debates related to religious questions and urges for social reform
 samaaj sudhaar ke prashn par vyakt hone vaala media kaa yah dwi-dhruviya charitra aage chal kar aupniveshik banaam rashtriya ke spasht virodhabhas main viksit ho gaya or 1947 main satta ke hastantaran tak kaayam rahaa
 Till the thirties, the number of English newspapers continued to increase, which was aimed at the British rule
 inkaa swaamitv bhi angrezon ke haath main hi tha
 The Times of India was also founded by Robert Knight in 1861 to merge the three newspapers of Bombay to serve British interests
 1849 main girish chandra ghosh ne pehla bengal recorder naam se aisa pehla akhbaar nikaala jiskaa swaamitv bhartiya haathon main tha
 In 1853, its name was changed to 'hindu Patriot'
 harishchandra mukherjee ke parakramee sampaadan main nikalne vaale is patr ne vibhinn prashnon par british sarkaar kii kadi aalochana kii parampara kaa sutarapaat kiya
 By the end of the century, on the one hand, the anti-colonial national leadership had become the basis, and on the other hand, in order to communicate the desire for independence, newspapers and magazines were being published in different languages all over the country
 bhartiya bhashaaon kii patrakarita british shashan ko aade haathon lene main katai nahin chookti thi
 For this reason, in 1878, the British enacted the Vernacular Press Act so that those who criticized it could shut the mouth of the press
 iskaa bharat or britain main jam kar virodh hua
 In 1885, the Indian National Congress was formed, whose activities continued to tilt towards vocal nationalism
 bhartiya bhashaaon ke press ne bhi isi rujhaan ke saath taal main taal mila kar apana vikaas kiya
 In the media, the twentieth century inherited a remarkable legacy under which newspapers and magazines were published under the leadership of Tilak, Gokhale, Dadabhai Naoroji, Surendranath Banerjee, Madanmohan Malaviya and Rabindranath Thakur
 bees ke dashak main gandhi ke disha-nirdesh main congress ek janandolan main badal gayi
 Gandhi himself contributed to national journalism by taking out three newspapers
 lekin is vikascram kaa ek doosraa dhruv bhi tha
 If led by these national figures, publications like Maratha, Kesari, Bengali, Harijan, Navjivan, Young India, Amrit Bazar Patrika, Hindustani, Advocate, Tribune, akhbar-e-aam, Sadhana, Prabasi, Hindustan Review, Review and Abhyudaya are anti-colonial The arguments and the idea of freedom were making their basis, then the Statesman of Calcutta, the Times of India of Bombay, the Mail of Madras, the Civil and Lahore The Military Gazette and the Pioneer of Allahabad openly believed in singing the virtues of English rule
 media-samskruti kaa yah dvibhajan bhashaai aadhaar par hi or aage badha
 The number of English newspapers favoring national sentiments remained few
 angrezi ke baaki akhbaar angrajon ke pitthu ban gayi
 Newspapers in Indian languages openly started raising anti-colonial voices
 angrez samarthak akhbaaron ke patrakaron ke vetan or suvidhaon kaa str bhartiya bhashaaon ke prakashnon main karyrat patrakaron ke vetan aadi se bahut acha tha
 The pro-british newspapers used to get a lot of advertisements and there was no shortage of resources for them
 upniveshwaad virdohi akhbaaron kaa poonji-aadhaar kamazor tha
 However, seeing the importance of English journalism, soon Malaviya, Muhammad Ali, Anne Besant, Motilal Nehru etc
 started English newspapers with nationalist views
 dilli se 1923 main congress kaa samarthan karne vaale bhartiya poonjipati ghanashyam das birla ne da hindustan times kaa prakaashan shuru kiya
 In 1938, Jawaharlal Nehru founded the English nationalist newspaper National Herald
 1826 main kalakatta se jugal kishor sukul ne udant maartand naamak pehla hindi samachar patr prakashit kiya tha
 The Hindi media asserted its claim in the first half of the twentieth century, when Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi founded Pratap, Balmukund Gupta and Ambika Sharan Vajpayee as Bharat Mitra, Maheshchandra Agarwal, Vishwamitra and Shivprasad Gupta founded today
 ek tarah se yah hindi-press kii shuruyaat thi
 During this time the foundation of Urdu-press was laid
 abul kalam azaad ne al-hilaal or al-bilaag kaa prakaashan shuru kiya, mohammad ali ne hamdard kaa
 Reality was published from Lucknow, Pratap and Milap from Lahore and Tez from Delhi
 bangla main sandhya, nayak, basumati, hitbaadi, nabshakti, anand bazaar patrika, jugantar, krishak or nabajug jaise prakaashan apane-apane drushtikonon se upniveshwaad virdohi abhiyaan main bhagidaari kar rahe the
 Induprakash, Navakal, Navashakti and Lokmanya in Marathi; Gujarati Pancha, Sevak, Gujarati and News in Gujarati, Vande Mataram; Malayala Manorama, Matrubhoomi, Swaraj, al-amin, Malayala Rajyam, Deshabhimani, United Karnataka, Andhra Patrika, Kalki, Tanti, Swadesamitram, Patriotam and Dinamani were playing the same role in South India
 yahan ek sawaal uth saktaa he ki yah rashtriya media kin myanon main rashtriya tha? isamen koi shaq nahin ki ye sabhi patr-patrikas british shashan kii virdohi thim, lekin upniveshwaad virdohi andolan kii dasha or disha ko lekar unke bich vaise hi matbhed the jaise congress or anya raajnneetik shaktiyon ke bich dikhaai padate the
 The British administration allowed an amateur radio club to be built in Madras in 1924
 teen saal baad nijee kshetra main broadcast company ne bombay or kalakatta main niyamit radio prasaaran shuru kiya
 But amateur radio clubs continued to run along
 prekshkon kii manyata he ki jis tarah in shaukia klbon ke kaaran angrezon ko radio kii baqayada sthapana kerani padi, kuch-kuch isi tarz par privet cabile operataron ke kaaran nabbe ke dashak main sarkaar ko television kaa aanshik nijeekaran karne kii ijazat deni padi
 However, the colonial government took over broadcasting in 1930 and in 1936 it was renamed 'all India Radio' or 'akashvani'
 hyderabad, travnakor, mysore, vadodara, trivendrum or aurangabad jaisi deshi riyasaton main bhi prasaaran chaalu ho gaya
 Radio was completely part of the propaganda of the British government
 sensorship, salaahkaar board or vibhageeya nigaraanee jaise sansthagat niyantrak upayon dwaara angrezon ne yah sunishchit kiya ki upniveshwaad virdohi raajnneeti ke paksh main radio se ek shabd bhi prasaarit na hone paye
 Interestingly, this English legacy continued even after India became independent
 angrezon ke baad akashwani ko bharat sarkaar ne us samay tak apana taabedaar banaaye rakhaa jab tak 1997 main akashwani ek swytt sanghathan kaa ang nahin ban gayi
 Since both the poles of the Indian media had established their identity by being in favor or opposition of the anti-colonial struggle, politics naturally became its central concern
 15 agast 1947 ko jaise hi satta kaa hastantaran hua or angrez bharat se jane ke liye apana boria-bistar sametane lage, media or sarkaar ke sambandh buniyadi taur se badal gayi
 On the one hand, the restrictions imposed by the British did not remain effective, and on the other hand, the ownership of most newspapers that advocated British rule passed into the hands of Indians
 lekin isse bhi zyaada mahatvapurn yah tha ki media ne raajnneetik netritv ke saath kandhe se kandhaa mila kar aadhunik bhartiya raashtra kaa nirmaan karnaa shuru kiya
 This second phase of media development continued till the eighties
 is lambe daur ke chaar ullekhneey aayam the : In independent India, the press showed no interest in toppling or defaming the government
 lekin saath hi vah satta kaa taabedaar banane ke liye taiyaar nahin tha
 His attitude was different from radio and TV
 radio-prasaaran karne vaali 'akashwani' puri tarah se sarkaar ke haath main thi
 Radio was also given the responsibility of programming for television, which started in 1959 with 'educational purposes'
 iske vipareet shuru se hi nijee kshetra ke swaamitv main viksit hue press ne sarkaar, sattarudh congress, vipakshi dalon or adhikaritantr ko baar-baar swa-paribhaashit raashtra-hit kii kasuti par kas kar dekha
 This process led him into the role of a vigilant agency criticizing him internally as part of the system
 bhartiya media ke kuch adhyetaon ne mana bhi he ki angrezon ke baad sarkaar ko diya gaya press kaa samarthan ek ‘satark samarthan’ hi tha
 The press prepared a universally accepted definition of 'national interest' which neither a meeting nor any document was passed to persuade
 par is bare main koi matbhed nahin tha ki udiyaman raashtra-rajya jis dhaanche ke aadhaar par khadaa hoga, uskaa charitra loktantric or secular hi hona chahie
 He also believed that to do so, frequent empowerment of oppressed social groups and communities was mandatory
 press-maalik, prabandhak or pramukh patrkaar apane-apane dhang se yah bhi maanate the ki is lakshya ko vedhane ke liye garibi ko samruddhi main badalanaa padegaa jiskaa rasta vaikasik arthshaastra or mishrit arthvyavastha se ho kar jaataa he
 The media also expressed positive agreement towards the foreign policy of independent India
 duusari taraf sarkaar ne apni taraf se press ke kaamkaaj ko viniyamit karne ke liye ek sansthagat dhaanchaa bananaa shuru kar diya
 Two Press Commissions were formed in 1952 and 1977
 1965 main ek samvidhangat sanstha press parishad kii sthapana hui
 In 1956, the Press Registrar of India was established under the 'registration of Books Act'
 in upayon main press kii azaadi ko simit karne ke andeshe bhi dekhe ja sakate the, par press ne in kadamon par aapatti nahin kii
 He was confident that the government would not under any circumstances violate the guarantee of freedom of expression found under Article 19 of the Constitution
 samvidhan main spasht ullekh na hone ke baavjood sarvocch court ne is guarantee main press kii swatantraaa ko bhi shaamil maan liya tha
 But this belief of the press broke in 1975 when the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed an internal emergency on the country to overcome her political crisis
 nattejey ke taur par naagarik adhikaar multavee kar diye gayi, swatantra abhivyakti or press par paabandiyaan laga di gayin
 253 journalists were detained, seven foreign correspondents were expelled, censorship was imposed and the Press Council was dissolved
 bhartiya press apane upar hone vaale is akraman kaa utana virodh nahin kar paaya, jitna use karnaa chahie tha
 But some succumbed to the government, but some even suffered losses and resisted the restrictions of the Emergency
 unniis maheene baad yah apatkaal chunaav kii kasuti par parajeet ho gaya, par is jatke ke kaaran pehali baar bhartiya press ne apni azaadi ke liye ladane kii zarurat mahasoos kii
 Its role to participate in the process of nation-building became more 'cautious' than before
 patrakaron kii satark nigaah ne dekha ki apatkaal kii paraajay ke baad bhi raajnneetik or satta pratishthan main press kii swatantraaa main katautee karne kii pravriti khatm nahin hui he
 After this, the decade of eighties proved to be the decade of struggles to protect freedom of expression
 1982 main bihar press vidheyak or 1988 main loksabhaa dwaara paarit kiye gayi manahani vidheyak ko rajasatta patrakaron dwaara kiye gayi andolanon ke kaaran kanoon main nahin badal paye
 On the other hand, the campaign launched by Indira Gandhi's government to persecute the express newspaper group also showed that there is a lot of misuse of power rather than changing the law to suppress any newspaper protest
 apatkaal ke viruddh chale lokapriy sangharsh ke parinamswaroop saare desh main raajnneetikaran kii prakriya pehle ke mukaable kahin tej ho gayi
 The new awareness of democracy and its inevitability attracted the attention of new readers towards newspapers
 ye naye pathak nirantar badhati ja rahi sakshartaa kii dein the
 The increasing media numbers resulted in a commercial and market-oriented approach to the printed media
 raajnneetikaran, sakshartaa or peshevraana drushtikon ke saath isi samay ek sukhad sanyog ke rup main nayi printing praudyogiki jud gayi
 The dex-top publishing system and computer-based designing created a new attraction in the presentation of newspapers and magazines
 is prakriya ne vigyaapan se hone vaali aamadani main badhotaree kii
 The most important of these changes during the eighties was the development of linguistic journalism
 hindi, punjabi, marathi, gujarati, bangla, asamiya or dakshin bhartiya bhashaaon ke akhbaaron ko is nayi paristhiti kaa sabase zyaada laabh hua
 The decade of eighties was also the decade of the rise of new journalists in these linguistic areas
 is vikascram ke baad bhashaai patrakarita ne phir peeche mud kar nahin dekha
 In the new century, data from the National Reader Survey revealed that the media is no longer in the hands of the English press
 sabase adhik prasar sankhya vaale pehle das akhbaaron main angrezi kaa keval ek hi patr rah gaya, vah bhi neeche se duusare sthaan par
 It was only in the eighties that conditions for the broadcast-media became free from government control to an extent
 1948 main samvidhan sabha main bolte hue jawaharlal nehru ne vaayada kiya tha ki azaad bharat main broadcasting kaa dhaanchaa british broadcasting corporation ke tarz par hoga
 It took 42 years for the governments of independent India to fulfill this assurance
 iske peeche radio or tivi ko sarkaar dwaara nirdeshit raajnneetik-saamaajik parivartan ke liye hi istemaal karne kii niti thi
 Under the influence of this policy, radio developed little as a medium, but TV could not progress further
 itnaa zarur hua ki 1975-76 main bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan ne america se ek upgrah udhaar liya taaki desh ke vibhinn hisson main 2,400 gaanvon main kaaryakramon kaa prasaaran ho sake
 It was called 'satellite Instructional Television Experiment'
 isaki safalataa se vibhinn bhashaaon main tivi kaaryakramon ke nirmaan or prasaaran kii sambhaavnaayen khuleen
 Then color television started in 1982 to telecast Delhi Asiad
 iske kaaran tivi ke prasar kii gati badi
 The number of its transmitters increased to 519 by 1990 and to 900 by 1997
 bibisi jaisaa swytt corporation banane ke sandarbh main 1966 tak keval itani pragati ho paayi ki bharat ke purv mahalekha niyantrak e
ke
 chanda ke netritv main bani cameti dwaara akashwani or doordarshan ko do swytt nigamon ke rup main gathit karne kii sifaarish kar di gayi
 For twelve years this recommendation also remained in cold storage
 1978 main bi
ji
 vargeez kii adhyakshata main gathit kiye gayi ek kaarydal ne 'akaash bharti' naamak sanstha gathit karne kaa suzav diya
 Years later, in May 1979, a bill to create a corporation called Prasar Bharati was brought to Parliament under which AIR and Doordarshan were to work
 prastaavit corporation ke liye vargeez cameti dwaara sujhaaye gayi akaash bharti ke mukaable kam adhikaron kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya tha
 However, this bill could not be passed as the Janata Party government fell
 1985 se 1988 ke bich doordarshan ko azaadi kaa ek halkaa sa jhonka naseeb hua
 The credit goes to Indian Administrative Service officer Bhaskar Ghosh, who was the Director General of Doordarshan during this period
 prasar bharti vidheyak paarit karaane kii zimmedaari vishwanath pratap singh kii rashtriya morcha sarkaar ne 1990 main puri kii
 But seven years passed when Prasar Bharati was formed
 takneekee rup se kaha ja saktaa he ki aaj doordarshan or akashwani swytt ho gayi hai
 But in reality only one additional secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is the Chief Executive Officer of Prasar Bharati
 agar yah swaittata he to bahut simit kism kii
 With the move to the nineties, the Indian media had to interview the changed world to a large extent
 is parivartan ke centre main 1990-91 kii teen parighatnaayen thim : mandal ayog kii sifaarishon se nikali raajnneeti, mandir andolan kii raajnneeti or bhoomandaleekaran ke tahat hone vaale aarthik sudhaar
 Together, these three pushed the left-wing trends of public life into the backdrop and the right wing accents came to the stage
 yahi vah kshan tha jab sarkaar ne prasaaran ke kshetra main 'khulaa akaash' kii niti apnaani shuru kii
 In the nineties, it not only gave Akashvani and Doordarshan a degree of autonomy by forming the Prasar Bharati Corporation, but also allowed indigenous private capital and foreign capital to enter the field of broadcasting
 print media main videshi poonji ko pravesh karne kaa rasta kholane main use kuch vakt laga lekin ikkisvin sadi ke pehle dashak main usne yah faisalaa bhi le liya
 The media is no longer 'single-sector', as before
 upabhokta-kranti ke kaaran vigyaapan se hone vaali aamadani main kai guna badhotaree hui jisase har tarah ke media ke liye vistaar hetu poonji kii koi kami nahin rah gayi
 Satellite TV first reached audiences through cable TV, an exceptional sample of local initiative and talent in terms of technology and entrepreneurship
 iske baad aayi dit praudyogiki jisane samachar prasaaran or manoranjan kii duniya ko puri tarah se badal daalaa
 With the success of FM radio channels, the medium of radio became a synonym for the civilian culture beset by motor vehicles
 1995 main bharat main internet kii shuruyaat hui or ikkisvin sadi ke pehle dashak ke ant tak badi sankhya main logon ke nijee or vyavsaayik jivan kaa ek ahm hissaa net ke zariye sansaadhit hone laga
 New media technologies gave its consumers the gift of 'convergence' which reached them like a magic casket with a handheld mobile phone
 in tamaam pahaluon ne mil kar media kaa dayera itnaa bada or vividh bana diya ki uske agosh main saarvajanik jivan ke adhiktar aayam aa gayi
 It was named as 'mediasphere'
 print media main videshi poonji ko ijazat milane kaa pehla asar yah padaa ki reutar, sienyen or bibisi jaise videshi media sanghathan bhartiya mediaswere kii taraf aakarshith hone lage
 He observed that the labor market in India is very cheap and more than one-fourth of the salary has to be spent here as per international standards
 isliye in global sansthaaon ne bharat ko apane media projecton ke liye outsorcing kaa centre banaaya bhartiya bazaar main maujuud media ke vishaal or asaadhaaran telent-pool kaa global bazaar ke liye dohan hone laga
 On the other hand, leading media companies in India were seen collaborating with Wall Street Journal, BBC, Financial Times, Independent News & Media and Australian publications
 gharaana-sanchalit companiyon par aadhaarit media bijnes ne poonji bazaar main ja kar apane-apane initial public ofrings arthath ipo prastaav jari karne shuru kar diye
 They were first started by visual media like NDTV, TV Today, Zee Telefilms
 electronic media ke tarz par print-media ne bhi poonji bazaar main chalaang lagaayi or apane vistaar ke liye nivesh hasil karne main jute gaya
 The first such attempt was done by 'the Deccan Chronicle' whose success solved a lot of capital crisis for the print-media
 duusari taraf bazarwaad ke badhate hue prabhaav or upabhokta kranti main aaye oochaal ke parinamswaroop vigyaapan-jagat main din-dooni-raat-chauguni badhotaree hui
 In the early forties, the number of advertising agencies would have been around fourteen to twenty
 1979-80 main newspaper socity kii manyata praapt agenciyon kii sankhya keval 168 tak hi bad saki thi
 However, the process of globalization increased their number to 750 in the next two decades, doing business of four hundred crores rupees annually
 1997-98 main sabase badi pandrah vigyaapan agenciyon ne hi kul 4,105
58 karod rupee ke bill kaate
 From this, it can be estimated how fast the consumer-revolution wheel was spinning
 vigyaapan kii rangeen or mohak hawaaon par savaar ho kar dur-dur tak failte upbhog ke sandeshon ne ucch varg, ucch-madhyam varg, samooche madhya varg or mazdoor varg ke kushhaal hote hue mahattvakankshi hisse ko apni banhon main samet liya
 The expansion of media was not possible without the tremendous increase in advertisements
 print-media or radio vigyapanon ko utana asardaar kabhi nahin bana saktaa tha jitna tivi ne banaaya
 TV spread in India was of late, but once inception it quickly insecured the already established print-medium in the media world
 is prakriya main cabile or dit ke yogadan kaa ullekh karnaa aavashyak he
 The spread and success of cable TV is a stellar example of the entrepreneurial talent of Indians
 sarkaar ke paas chunki kisi susangat sanchaar niti kaa abhaav tha isliye nabbe ke dashak kii shuruyaat main bahumanjili imaaraton main rahane vaali madhyavargeey or nimna-madhyavargeey aabaadiyon main kuch utsaahi or chatur logon ne apni nijee pahalakadami par chlose sarkit television prasaaran kaa prabandh kiya jiskaa centre ek central control room hua karata tha
 These people started showing Indian and foreign films through video players
 saath main darshakon ko manoranjan kii choubees ghante chalane vaali khuraaq dene vaale videshi-deshi satellite channel bhi dekhne ko milte the
 In January 1992, the cable network had only 41 lakh subscribers
 lekin keval chaar saal ke bheetar 1996 main yah sankhya banwe lakh ho gayi
 By the next year, cable broadcasting was being seen in 31 percent of all TV households across the country
 sadi ke ant tak bade aakaar ke gaanvon or kasbon ke tivi darshakon tak cabile kii pahunch ho chuki thi
 Seeing the popularity of cable and satellite TV channels, the major media companies jumped into the TV program-making business
 ve public or privet tivi channelon ko kaaryakramon kii supplai karne lage
 It is clear that cable and DTH steps could have been frozen only if the growth in the first public and private television broadcasts made the ground
 1982 main dilli asiad ke marfat rangeen tivi ke kadam padate hi bharat main tivi transmitaron kii sankhya tezi se badi
 With the help of nine hundred transmitters and three different satellites, Public tv's broadcast network Doordarshan covered 70 percent of the country's geographical area and 87% of its population
 uskaa mukhya channel didi-van tees karod logon tak pahunchne kaa daawa karne laga
 Private TV broadcasting continues to expand its reach through cable and DTH
 lagbhag sabhi global tivi network apni bal par yaa sthaneey partneron ke saath apane prasaaran kaa vistaar kar rahe hai
 Indian channels are also not far behind and are engaged in night and day competition with them
 angrezi or hindi ke channelon ke saath-saath kshetreey bhashaaon ke manoranjan or news channelon kii lokapriyata or vyavsaayik kamyaabi bhi ullekhneey he

 In the meaning of Anulom marriage, the behavior of the words 'anulom' and 'pratilom' is not found in the Vedic literature
 panini ne in shabdon se vyutpann shabd ashtaadhi main ginaae hai or iske baad smritigranthon main in shabdon kaa bahutayat se prayog hota dikhaai detaa he, jisase anumaan hota he ki uttar vaidic kaal ke samaaj main anulom evam pratilom vivaahon kaa prachaar badha
 The common meaning of Anulom marriage is to marry your Varna to a lower Varna
 iske vipareet kisi nimnastar varna ke purush or ucchattar varna kii kanya ke bich sambandh kaa sthapit hona pratilom vivaah kehalaata he
 Often, the examination of the scriptures proves the same principle that only the marriages were accepted by the scriptures, although both types of parables are found in the epics
 anulom vivaah se utpann santan ke vishay main aisa saamaanya mat jaan padataa he ki use mata ke varna ke anuroop maanate hai
 a contrasting example of this is found in the Buddhist Jataka by Fick in the 'bhadsal Jataka'; According to which the mother's family is not seen, the father's family is seen
 anulom se utpann santanon or prajatiyon ke sambandh main vibhinn shastron main vibhinn mat paae jate hai, jin sabakaa yahan ullekh karnaa kathin he

 This article has been translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article Mary Cassatt
 mairi stewanson kasaat ek america chitrakaar or printmekar thi
 He spent much of his adult life in France, where he befriended Edgar Degas and later exhibited his work among the Sanskarists
 kasaat ne aksar, maataaon or bacchon ke bich ke ghanishtha rishton par vishesh jor dene vaale, mahilaon ke saamaajik or nijee jivan ke chitra banaae
 Cassatt was born in the city of Allegheny, Pennsylvania, now part of Pittsburgh
 unka janm anukool paristhitiyon main hua tha: unke pita, robert simpasan cast, ek safal share dalal or bhoomi vyapaaree the or unki maan, catherine kelso johnston, ek banking parivaar se thim
 But the ancestral name was Cossart
 kasaat kalakaar rabart henry kii dur kii bahin thim
 Kasat was one of seven children, two of whom died early
 unka parivaar purv kii ore chalaa gaya, pehle lankaster, pencylvania main, phir philadelphia main, jahaan chah saal kii umr main unhone schuli shiksha shuru kii
 In the environment in which Kasat grew up, travel was seen as an integral part of education, he spent five years in Europe and visited many capitals including London, Paris and Berlin
 videshon main unhone german or french sikhi or chitrakaari va sangeet main pehla sabak liya
 He was first informed of the French artists Ingres, Delacroix, Karot and Courbet at the 1855 Paris World's Fair
 iske alaava is pradarshnee main degas or pissrro ke kaam bhi pradarshit the, jo bhavishya main unke sahyogi or salaahkaar hone vaale the
 Although her family opposed her becoming a professional artist, Cassatt began studying painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the early age of fifteen
 kasaat ke liye, nariwadi vichaar or kuch purush chaatro ke bohemian vyavhaar kii jaankaree, unke mata pita kii chintaa kaa hissaa thi
 Although 20 percent of the students were female, most viewed art as a socially valuable skill; But there were some of them like Kasat, who wanted to make art a career
 unhone america naagarik yuddh ke varshon ke dauraan apni padhai jari rakhi
 unke saathi chaatro main thomas ankins bhi the, jo baad main is academy ke vivaadaaspad nirdeshak the
 Impatient with the slow pace of education and the kind approach of male students and teachers, he decided to study the old masters on his own
 unhone baad main kaha, academy main "koi shikshan nahin tha"
 mahila chaatr jaandaar modelon kaa prayog nahin kar sake or pramukh prashikshan tha mukhya rup se saanche se drawing karnaa
 Kasat decided to end his studies
 After overcoming her father's objection, she moved to Paris with her mother and family friends in 1866 as chaperones
 As women still could not attend the लेcole des beau-arts, they applied to study separately from the school masters
 jise jein-lon garomen ke saath adhyayan ke liye sweekaar kar liya gaya, jo apni ati-yathartwaadee takanic or aakarshak vishyon ke chithran ke liye ek ucch shikshak maane jate the
 a few months later Gérôme also admitted Aikins as a student
 kasaat ne apane kalatmak prashikshan ko lauvre main rojaanaa kapi karke aage badhaayaa 
sangrahalay bhi ek saamaajik, milane ke sthaan jaisaa tha french purush or america mahila chaatro ke liye, jinhen kasaat kii tarah cafe main bhaag lene ke liye anumati nahin thi, jahaan khaas log hi milte the
 In this manner, her fellow artist and friend Elizabeth Jane Gardner met and married the famous academic painter william-adolphe Bouguereau
 1866 ke ant main wo, charles chaplin, ek jane maane style kalakaar kii painting class main shaamil ho gayin
 In 1868, Cassatt also studied with the artist Thomas Couture, whose subjects were mostly romantic and urban
 dehaat kii yatra par, chaatro ne jivan se, vishesh rup se kisaanon kii dainik gatividhiyon se chithran kiya
 In 1868 a portrait of him, a Mandarin player, was first accepted by the selection jury for Paris Salon

 Parashar, Katyayan, Yajnavalkya, Vyasa, Panini etc
 are called Vedavetta of ancient times
 vedon ke vidit hone yani chaar rishiyon ke dhyaan main aane ke baad inaki vyakhya karne kii parampara rahi he 
 Therefore, as a result only one Vedka form has been considered as four mantras, Brahmins, Aranyakas, Upanishads

 Although in today's era we are creating a feeling of unity, unity and love in the whole world, but in the period when Britain ruled India, many myths arose from the translation of Vedas by some Anglo translators

 This omnipotent text of Vedic Age is also known as 'vedatrayi'
 pehle yah veda granth ek hi tha jiskaa naam yajurveda tha- ekaivasid yajurveda chaturdhah vyabhajat punah vahi yajurveda punah rik-yajus-saamah ke rup me prasiddh hua jisase vah 'trayee' kahalaaya | baad main veda ko padhanaa bahut kathin prathit hone laga, isliye usee ek veda ke teen yaa chaar vibhaag kiye gaye
 Then he came to be known as Vedatrayi in the form of Rigyajusam or Chaturveda as Rigyjusamatharva after a long time
 mantron kaa prakaar or aashay yani arth ke aadhaar par vargeekaran kiya gaya
 Its basis is as follows - vaidic parampara do prakaar ke he - brahm parampara or aditya parampara
 The Vedatrayi tradition of both traditions was famous in ancient times
 vishwa main shabd-prayog kii teen sheliyaan hoti he: padya, gadhy or gaan
 There are three such divisions 'verse, prose and song' of Vedas mantras - padya main akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam kaa nishchit niyam hota he
 Therefore, the noun of fixed letter-number and Ved-mantras with foot and punctuation is 'rik'
 jin mantron main chand ke niyamanusaar akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam rishidrisht nahin he, ve gadyatmak mantra 'yajuh' kehalaate hai or jitne mantra ganaatmak hai, ve mantra ‘'sam'’ kehalaate hai
 On the basis of these three types of word-publishing-styles, the word 'trilogy' is also used for Veda in scripture and folk
 yajurveda gadhysangrah he, at: is yajurveda main jo rugveda ke chandobaddh mantra hai, unako bhi yajurveda padhane ke samay gadhy jaisaa hi padhaa jaataa he
 The said four divisions of the Vedas were not separate before the end of Dwaparyuga
 us samay to rik, yajuh or sam - in teen shabd-shaileonme sangrahatmak ek vishisht adhyayaneey shabd-raashi hi veda kehalaati thi
 Atharva also became attached to Veda's counterpart after that, then in place of 'trilogy' he started being called 'chaturveda'
 When the Guru was angry, Yajnavalkya, who received all the Vedas from Aditya, said in his memory after Vedatrayi and in front of Puranas, including Atharva, Veda s Tharvapuranani eti
 vartmaan kaal main veda chaar hai- lekin pehle ye ek hi the
 In the present tense, the Vedas are considered four
 parantu in chaaron ko milakar ek hi 'veda granth' samajha jaataa tha
 Significantly, despite the trilogy, the Veda was one, then it was divided into four parts
 sunne se failane or peedi-dar-peedi yaad rakhane ke kaaran vaa srishtikarta brahmaji bhi apaurushey vanike rupame praapt karne ke kaaran shruti, swatah pramaan ke kaaran amnaay, purush bhinn ishvarkrut hone se apaurushey ityadi naam vedon ke hai
 Hearing and remembering Gurmukh in the order of reading and reciting the Veda is of great importance in terms of the preservation and success of the Veda
 isi kaaran veda ko ‘'shruti'’ bhi kehete hai
 The Veda is conserved through diligent practice, hence the name "amnaya"
 vedon kii raksharth maharishiyon ne asht vikrutiyonki rachana kii he -jataa maala shikha rekha dhwajo dando ratho ghanah | ashtau vikrutyah prokto krampurva maharaayah || jiske falswarup pracheen kalke tarah aaj bhi hrasv, deergh,plutt or udaatt,anudaatt swarit adike anurup mantroccharan hota he
 Accordingly, the classification of the Vedic word-zodiac of each branch - each Veda mentioned above has four parts
 pehle bhaag mantrabhag ke alaava anya teen bhagako veda na maanane vaale bhi hai lekin aisa vichaar tarkpurna siddh hote nahin dekha gaya hai
 In the eternal Vedic tradition, mantra, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishad are the four components of the same Veda
 kul milakar vedake bhaag ye hai :- Despite the above four sections being Vedas, some people consider only 'samhita' as Vedas
 dwaparayug kii samaapti ke samay shrikrishnadwaipayan vedavyas ji ne yagyanushthan ke upyog ko drushtigat rakhkar us ek veda ke chaar vibhaag kar diye or in chaaron vibhaagon kii shiksha chaar shishyon ko di
 These four divisions are famous as Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda
 pel, vaishampayan, jaimini or sumantu naamak -chaar shishyon ko kramshah rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda kii shiksha di
 These four disciples taught Shakal etc
 to their different disciples
 in shishyon ke dwaara apane-apane adheen vedon ke prachaar va sangrakshan ke kaaran ve vaidic granth,charan ,shakha, pratishakha or anushaakha ke madhyam se bahut rupame vistaarit hogaye | unheen prachaarak rishiyon ke naam se prasiddh hai
 The aforementioned four disciples started as many disciples as they were called Charanasamuh
 Each stage has many branches in us
 or isi tarah pratishakha,anushaakha aadi ban gaye
 Several branches of the Vedas, that is, the method of lecture, have been described
 rishi patanjali ke mahabhashya ke anusaar rugveda kii 21, yajurveda kii 101, samaveda kii 1001, arthvveda kii 9 is prakaar 1131 shakhaaen hai parantu aaj 12 shakhaaen hi mul granthon main uplabdh hai
 The Vedic words of each branch of the Veda are available in four parts: 1
 Samhita 2
 Brahmin 3
 Aranyaka 4
 Upanishads
 kuch log inamen samhita ko hi veda maanate hai
 The remaining three parts are considered as the interpretation texts of the Vedas
 alag shakhaon main mul samhita to vahi rahati hai lekin aaranyak or brahman granthon main antar aa jaataa he
 Upanishad is also found in many mantras, as in the Shuklayujurveda mantrabhag, the Isavasopanishad
 In the old times, there were as many branches as there were mantras, Brahmins, Aranyakas and Upanishads
 Babajud of such branches is also found in texts of only 9 branches today
 anya shakhaonme kisiike mantra,kisiike brahman,kisiike aaranyak or kisiike upanishad hi paaya jaataa he
 Not only this, even more branches are found in Upanishads, only then more Upanishads are found

 It is also called Atharva Angiras mainly due to the mantras of Rishis and Atharvan

 There are many sutras in each kand and there are mantras in sutras

 Its two branches Shaunik and Piplad are available today
 atharvaveda kaa vidvan chaaron vedon kaa gyaata hota he
 In the Yajna, the Rigveda calls for the Gods, the Samaveda is the oblation, the Yajurveda's Adhvaryu Dev: finishes the coterm and the Atharvaveda's Brahma controls the entire Yagya Karma
 ayurveda, dhanurveda, gandharvaveda tathaa sthapatyaved- ye kramshah chaaron vedon ke upved katyayan ne batalaaye hai
 For all round practice of Vedas, there are texts of education, kalpa, grammar, nirukta, chhanda and astrology which are called 6 parts
 pratipadsutra, anupad, chandobhasha, dharamshastra, nyaay tathaa vaisheshik- ye 6 darshana upang granth bhi uplabdh he
 The topics of appendages are as follows - veda kii samhitaon main mantraksharon main khadi tathaa aadi rekhaayen lagaakar unke ucch, madhyam, yaa mand sangitamay swar uccharan karne ke sanket kiye gayi hai
 They are named as the sublime, Anudatta and Swarit
 ye swar bahut pracheen samay se prachlit hai or mahamuni patanjali ne apane mahabhashya main inke mukhya mukhya niyamon kaa samavesh kiya he
 Vowels are spoken more or less as they also have two distinctions
 jaise udaatt-udaattatar, anudaatt-anudaattatar, swarit-swaritodatt
 Apart from these, there is considered to be another vowel - Shruti - the three vowels merge in it
 is prakaar kul swaron kii sankhya 7 ho jaati he
 Even in these seven vowels, there is a distinction between the vowels for which there is some change in the vowels
 yadhyapi in swaron ke ankan or tankan main kai vidhiyaan prayog kii jaati hai or prakaashak-bhashyakaron main koi ek vidha saamaanya nahin he, adhikansh sthanon par anudaatt ke liye akshar ke neeche ek aadi lakeer tathaa swarit ke liye akshar ke upar ek khadi rekha banane kaa niyam he
 Sublime has no sign of its own
 isse ankan main samasya aane se kai lekhak-prakaashak swar chihnon kaa prayog hi nahin karte
 There are many types of verses used in Vedic mantras, the main ones are- iske anusaar vedokt yagyon kaa anushthan hi veda ke shabdon kaa mukhya upyog mana gaya he
 From the beginning of the creation, there has generally been a diversity in the style, chanting and rituals of chanting
 is vividhta ke kaaran hi vedon kii shakhaon kaa vistaar hua he
 There are 21 branches of Rigveda, 101 branches of Yajurveda, 1000 branches of Samaveda and 9 branches of Atharva Veda - thus there are a total of 1,131 branches
 is sankhya kaa ullekh maharishi patanjali ne apane mahabhashya main bhi kiya he
 Out of the above 1,131 branches, currently only 12 branches are available in the original texts: - uparyukt 12 shakhaon main se keval 6 shakhaon kii adhyayan-style praapt he-shakal, taittareey, madhyandini, kaanv, kauthum tathaa shaunak shakha
 It would also not be inappropriate to say that some other texts of other branches are available, but they cannot get full introduction of the branch and the names of many branches are also not available
 jaisaa ki upar likhaa he, vedon ke kai shabdon kaa samajhnaa utana saral nahin rahaa he
 In order to understand the real meaning of Vedanka, Vedangauka was invented from within
 Because of this, the meanings described in them cannot be known
 Most of the controversies have been about the nature of God, that is, the one or the like of many gods
 vedonke vaastavik arth vahi kar saktaa he jovedang- shiksha,kalp, vyakaran, nirukt,chand or jyotishka gyaata he
 The interpretation of Sanskrit scholars of Europe has also been inspired by the theory of indo-aryan caste
 pracheen kaal main hi inaki satta ko chunauti dekar kai aise mat prakat hue jo aaj bhi dharmik mat kehalaate hai lekin kai roopon main bhinn hai
 Their main differences are explained below
 uname se jiskaa apana avichhinn paramparase veda,shakha,or kalpasutron se nirdeshit hokar ek adwitiya brahmatatvako iswar maanakar kisi ek devvadame na ulajhakar vedavadame raman karte hai ve vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm mananevaale he ve hi vedonko sarvopari maanate he
 Apart from this, there are some sects who hold different views and consider them as separate gods
 jin vishyon par vivaad rahaa he unka varnan neeche diya he
 Yajna: There is a contradiction in many scholars, opinions and commentators regarding the importance of the present form of Yajna
 yajna main aag ke prayog ko pracheen parsi pujan vidhi ke itnaa samaan hona or havan kii atyadhik mahatta ke prati vidwaanon main ruchi rahi he
 Deity: There has been disagreement among many scholars about the word Dev
 vedokt nirgun- niraakaar or sagun- saakaar me se antim pakshako maanane vaale kai maton main ise mahamanushya ke rup main vishisht shakti praapt saakaar charitra masajhate hai or unka murti rup main pujan karte hai to anya kai inhen ishwar ke hi naam bataate hai
 Philanthropic things, learned people and guiding mantras have been called devas
 udaahranarth agni shabd kaa arth aag na samajhakar sabase aage yani pratham yani parameshwar samajhate hai
 The meaning of the deity Shavad is considered divine, that is, full of the power of God - like earth etc
 isi mat main mahadev, devon ke adhipati hone ke kaaran ishwar ko kehete hai
 Similarly, due to the universal God Vishnu and truth everywhere, it is called Brahma
 is prakaar brahma, vishnu or mahadev kisi charitra ke naam nahin balki ishwar ke hi naam he
 Vedic and temporal words are used to determine the meaning of grammar and nirukta
 iske abhavame arthke anarth kar baithte he
