 They were colloquially called "princely", "princely" or in a broad sense a native princely state
 ye british samrajya dwaara sidhe shasit nahin the balki bhartiya shaskaon dwaara shasit the
 But those Indian rulers were indirectly controlled by British rule
 san 1947 main jab hindustan azaad hua tab yahan 565 riyaasaten thim
 Most of these princely states had taken a 'contract' with the British government to provide public service and collect taxes
 kul 565 main se keval 21 riyasaton main hi sarkaar thi or mysore, hyderabad tathaa kashmir naam kii sirf 3 riyaasaten hi kshetrafal main badi thim
 On 15 August 1947, after the liberation from the British, all these princely states were merged into partitioned India and post-partition country Pakistan

 Subsequently political ambitions were inspired during the conflict with the French

 In this century, the company established sovereign power over the whole of India by taking advantage of the mutual quarrels of the native states
 anek rajya uske samrajya main villin ho gayi
 All others became patronized by the company after obtaining its protection
 yah adheen rajya 'riyasat' kahe jane lage
 Their condition became progressively unsatisfactory and disastrous

 This opportunistic policy was implemented with the princely states of Awadh and Hyderabad
 iske anusaar dikhaave ke liye unke saath samanta kaa vyavhaar kiya gaya
 But the reality was that in the process, the company did not let any opportunity to subdue them, weaken their military power and take control over its entire parts
 riyasaton ke prati jitani nitiyaan company ne bhavishya main apanaayin unamem se adhikansh avadh main poshit huin
 During this period, the company split into Mysore and Maratha states and fought against them with the help of Hyderabad

 Travancore and Coorg came under the patronage of the company
 1799 se 1805 tak lord velezali kii agragami niti ke falswaroop surat, karnataka tathaa tanjor ke rajyon kaa ant ho gaya
 Awadh, Hyderabad, Baroda, Poona and Mysore were badly held in the company by subsidiary treaties

 All anti-british foreigners were removed from the states

 Due to these objectionable policies, there was discontent among the princely states which led to the armed revolution of 1857
 kranti ke samay swaarth se prerit hokar adhikansh deshi shaasha company ke prati swamibhakt bane rahe
 After the revolution, there were 562 princely states in India under which 46 percent was land

 Their policies relating to octroi, trade, impulse, currency, famine and traffic began to be influenced by the policies of British India
 unki koi anterrashtriya sthiti hi na rahi
 The interference of British government in the princely states over misrule, tyranny, treason and succession quarrels increased

 Vande Mataram was second in the top 10 songs in the poll
 yadi bangla bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaay to iskaa sheershak "bande maataram" hona chaiye "vande maataram" nahin
 Since the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bengali script and since there is no other letter in Bengali script, it was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay under the title Bande Mataram
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sheershak 'bande maataram' hona chaiye tha
 But there is no meaning of 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and "vande Mataram" pronunciation means "I pray to Mother", so writing and reading Vande Mataram in Devanagari script would be expedient

 Initially, only two of its verses were composed, which were in Sanskrit
 in donon padon main keval mathrubhumi kii vandana thi
 When he wrote a Bengali novel called Anand Math in 1882, then he also included this song in the love of the motherland
 yah upanyaas angreji shashan, jameendaaron ke shoshan va prakritik prakope main mar rahi janata ko jaagrit karnehetu achaanak uth khadey hue sanyasi vidroh par aadhaarit tha

 In all these latter terms, the motherland is praised as Durga

 It is said that he wrote this song on the train while coming to Naihati from Sealdah
 bengal main chale swadhinata-aandolan ke dauraan vibhinn reliyon main josh bharne ke liye yah geet gaaya jane laga
 Gradually this song became highly popular among the people
 british sarkaar isaki lokapriyata se bhayakrant ho uthi or usne is par pratibandh lagane par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur sang this song at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1896
 paanch saal baad yani san 1901 main kalakatta main hue ek anya adhiveshan main shri charandas ne yah geet punah gaaya

 In 1907, when Madame Bhikhaji Cama hoisted the tricolor in Stuttgart, Germany, "vande Mataram" was written in the middle of it
 arya printing press, lahore tathaa bhartiya press, dehradun se san 1929 main prakashit kakori ke shahid pan0 ram prasad 'bismil' kii pratibandhit pustak "kranti gitanjali" main pehla geet "matra-vandana" vande maataram hi tha jisamen unhone keval is geet ke do hi pad diye the or uske baad is geet kii prashasti main vande maataram sheershak se ek swarchit urdu ghazal di thi jo us kalkhand ke asankhya anaam hutatmaon kii aawaaj ko abhivyakti detii he
 Restricted in the British period, this book is now edited and available in libraries
 swadhinata sangram main is geet kii nirnaayak bhagidaari ke baavjood jab raashtragan ke chayan kii baat aayi to vande maataram ke sthaan par rabindranath thakur dwaara likhe va gaaye gayi geet jan gana man ko variyata di gayi
 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song "vande Mataram", because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In view of these objections, in 1937, the Congress took a deep view on this dispute
 jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti jisamen moulana abul kalam aaazaad bhi shaamil the, ne paaya ki is geet ke shuruuaati do pad to mathrubhumi kii prashansa main kahe gayi hai, lekin baad ke padon main hindu devi-devataaon kaa zikr hone lagata he; isaliye yah nirnay liya gaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do padon ko hi raashtra-geet ke rup main prayukt kiya jaayegaa
 In this way, Jana Hee Jan-gana-man Adhinayak of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Thakur was allowed to remain as the national anthem and Mohammad Iqbal's Qaumi Tarane Saare Jahan Se Achcha with the initial two-song song Vande Mataram national song composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was approved
 swatantrata prapti ke baad dow rajendra prasad ne samvidhan sabha main 24 janvari 1950 main 'vande maataram' ko raashtragit ke rup main apnaane sambandhi vaktavy padhaa jise sweekaar kar liya gaya
 The statement made by Dr
 Rajendra Prasad to the Constituent Assembly is as follows: anand math upanyaas ko lekar bhi kuch vivaad hai, kuch kattar log ise muslim virdohi maanate hai
 He says that in this, Muslims have been described as foreign and traitorous
 vande maataram gane par bhi vivaad kiya ja rahaa he
 The first two stops of this song, which are relevant, do not contain any anti-muslim talk and do not worship any goddess or Durga
 par in logon kaa kahana he ki- However, it is not the case that all Muslims of India object to this or that all Hindus insist on singing it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kuch saal pehle vikhyath sangeetkaar e0 aar0 rahamaan ne, jo khud ek musalmaan hai, vande maataram ko lekar ek sangeet elbum taiyaar kiya tha jo bahut lokapriy hua
 Most people believe that this dispute is political
 kya kisi ko koi geet gane ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he athwa nahin? yah prashn sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh bijoy emmanuele varses kerala rajya naam ke ek vaad main uthaaya gaya
 In this suit, some students were expelled from school because they refused to sing the national anthem Jana Gana Mana
 yah vidhyaarthee skool main raashtragan ke samay iske sammaan main khadey hote the tathaa iskaa sammaan karte the par geet ko gaate nahin the
 He refused to sing
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne unki yachika sweekaar kar lee or skool ko unhen waapas lene ko kaha
 The Supreme Court said that if a person honors the national anthem but does not sing it, it does not mean that he is insulting it
 at: ise na gane ke liye us vyakti ko dandit yaa pratadit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since Vande Mataram is the national anthem of this country, the same law and rules will apply even if it is forced to sing forcefully

 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad ke kaal main sanyukt rajya america or soviet rus ke bich utpann tanaav kii sthiti ko sheet yuddh ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It has also been given the name of 'arms Faced Shanti' by some historians
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan sanyukt rajya america, britain or rus ne kandhe se kandha milakar dhuri rashtron- germany, italy or japan ke viruddh sangharsh kiya tha
 But as soon as the war ended, intense differences arose between Britain and the United States on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other
 bahut jald hi in matbhedon ne tanaav kii bhayankar sthiti utpann kar di
 Communist countries under the leadership of Russia and capitalist countries under the leadership of America were divided into two camps
 in donon pakshon main aapasi takaraahat aamane saamne kabhi nahin hui, par ye donon gut is prakaar kaa vaataavaran banaate rahe ki yuddh kaa khatra sadaa saamne dikhaai padataa rahata tha
 Berlin Crisis, Korea War, Molecular Testing by Soviet Russia, Military Organization, Indian China Problem, U-2 Plane Scandal, Cuban Missile Crisis were some of the circumstances which ignited the fire of Cold War
 san 1991 main soviet rus ke vighatan se uski shakti kam ho gayi or shityudh kii samaapti ho gayi
 As is clear from its name, it is not a war of arms and weapons but a war confined to threats
 is yuddh main koi vaastavik yuddh nahin ladaa gaya
 It was limited to indirect war only
 is yuddh main donon mahashaktiyon ne apane vaicharik matbhed hi pramukh rakhe
 It was a type of diplomatic war, which was based on the efforts of the narrow powers of the superpowers
 ke
pi
es
 minan ke anusaar - sheet yuddh do virdohi vichaardhaaraon - poonjeevaad or samrajyavad, do vyavasthaaon - burjua loktantr tathaa sarvhaara taanaashaahee, do guton - nato or varsa samjhauta, do rajyon - america or soviet sangh tathaa do netaaon - jon foster illaas tathaa stallin ke bich yuddh tha jiskaa prabhaav puure vishwa par padaa
 Thus it can be said that the Cold War was a speech war between two superpowers based on diplomatic measures
 yah donon mahashaktiyon ke madhya dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad utpann tanaav kii pratyaksh abhivyakti tha
 It was even more terrible than the actual war, being an ideological war
 shityudh ke lakshan dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan hi prakat hone lage the
 Both the superpowers were fighting the war keeping in mind their narrow interests and showing the spirit of mutual cooperation
 jo sahyog kii bhaavana yuddh ke dauraan dikhaai de rahi thi, vah yuddh ke baad samaapt hone lagi thi or shityudh ke lakshan spasht taur par ubharne lag gaye the, donon guton main hi ek duusare kii shikaayat karne kii bhaavana balwati ho gai thi
 There were some strong grounds for these complaints
 ye parsparik matbhed hi shityudh ke pramukh kaaran the, shityudh kii utpatti ke pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit hai- The Cold War developed slowly
 iske lakshan 1917 main hi prakat hone lage the jo dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad spasht taur par ubharkar vishwa rangamanch par aae
 The spirit of mutual fear and mistrust between the two powers contributed to its promotion
 donon mahashaktiyon dwaara ek duusare ke viruddh chali gai chaalon ne is shityudh ko sabal aadhaar pradaan kiya or ant main donon mahashaktiyaan khulkar ek duusare kii aalochana karne lagi or samast vishwa main bhay va ashaanti kaa vaataavaran taiyaar kar diya, iske badhaava dene main donon mahashaktiyaan baraabar kii bhagidaar rahi
 Its development sequence can be understood in the following steps - is samay ke dauraan shityudh kaa asli rup ubhara
 The differences between the US and the Soviet Union came to light
 is kaal main sheet yuddh ko badhaane dene vaali pramukh ghatnaayen nimnlikhit hai- During this time, there was a possibility of some changes in the behavior of both the superpowers
 is yug main donon deshon ke netritv main parivartan hua
 After Stalin's death in the Soviet Union, Khushchev took over the reins and President Eisen Haver took over the reins in the US
 soviet sangh kii taraf se donon deshon ke madhya madhur sambandh sthapit karne ke prayaas avashya hue lekin unka koi sakaaratmak parinaam nahin niklaa or america tathaa soviet sangh main sheet yuddh kaa tanaav jari rahaa
 During this time a few incidents occurred which gave impetus to the Cold War
 is prakaar is yug main sheet yuddh ko badhaava dene vaali kaarywahiyaan donon taraf se hui
 But both the superpowers also made some efforts towards reducing the tension of the Cold War
 khruschev ne donon deshon ke madhya sambandh madhur banane or tanaav kam karne ke liye 15 sitambar se 28 sitambar 1959 tak america kii yatra kii
 On 5 September 1963, there was a 'moscow Partial Trial Prohibition Treaty' between the US, Soviet Union and Britain
 isse sheet yuddh ko samaapt karne kaa sakaaratmak kadam kaha gaya
 The non-aligned Movement also tried to reduce the Cold War during this period, but the results of all these efforts remained negative and tension remained in both the superpowers
 1962 main cuba sankat ke baad sheet yuddh ke vaataavaran main kuch narmi ai or donon guton ke madhya vyaapt tanaav kii bhaavana sauhardpurn va mitrataa kii bhaavana main badalane ke asaar dikhaai dene lag gaye
 This started showing signs of the beginning of a sweet relationship between the two countries
 is narmi yaa tanaav main kami ko 'ditant' yaa 'tanavshithily' kii sangya di jaati he
 The tradition changed the landscape of the old international relations arising out of the Cold War and a peaceful atmosphere was born in the world
 isse sanyukt raashtra sangh kii bhoomika main bhi vruddhi hui or parmaanu yuddh ke aatank se chhutkaaraa mila
 The 1970s saw the transition to a new type of cold war as soon as the Afghanistan crisis was born
 is sankat ko 'ditant kii antim shavyatra' kaha jaataa he
 This brought an end to the tragedy, and the tension between the two powers that had lasted for almost a decade took days of diabolism and old tensions began to rise again
 isaki utpatti ke pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit hai All these reasons led to the birth of a new cold and the end of the tradition
 isse antarrashtriya sambandhon main nai khatas paidaa hui america ne khadi siddhanth ke dwaara vishwa shaanti ke liye khatra paidaa kar diya
 This new Cold War brought the world to the brink of World War III
 isse ditant kii haani hui or nishastreekaran ko gaharaa dhakka laga
 This made the centers of tension Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Nicaragua etc
 yah yuddh vichaardhaara virdohi na hokar soviet sangh virdohi tha
 Its agents were Britain, France and China, not just the US and Soviet Union
 is yuddh ne sampoorn vishwa kaa vaataavaran hi dooshit kar diya
 This gave rise to multipolarization and introduced new challenges in international relations
 shityudh ne 1946 se 1989 tak vibhinn charnon se guzarate hue alag-alag rup main vishwa raajnneeti ko prabhavit kiya
 This led to tensions between the US and the Soviet Union as well as other effects
 iske antarrashtriya sambandhon par nimnlikhit prabhaav pade- It can be said that the Cold War had a wide impact on international relations
 isane samast vishwa kaa do guton main vibhaajan karke vishwa main sangharsh kii pravriti ko badhaava diya
 It created a balance of terror in place of a balance of power
 lekin nakaaratmak prabhaavon ke saath-saath iske kuch sakaaratmak prabhaav bhi pade
 This paved the way for technical and technical development
 isse yathartwaadee raajnneeti kaa aavirbhaav hua or vishwa raajnneeti main nae rajyon kii bhoomika ko bhi mahatvapurn mana jane laga

 paaritantr yaa paristhitik tantra ek prakritik ikai he jisamen ek kshetra vishesh ke sabhi jeevadharee, arthath paudhe, jaanavar or anujiv shaamil hai jo ki apane ajaev paryaavaran ke saath antarkriya karke ek sampoorn jaivik ikai banaate hai
 Thus ecosystems are a unit of interdependent components that divide the same habitat
 paaritantr aamtaur anek khaadya jaal banaate hai jo paristhitiki tantra ke bheetar in jeevon ke anyonyashray or urja ke pravaah ko dikhaate hai
 The term ecosystem was coined in 1930 by Roy Clapham to denote the combined physical and biological components of an environment
 british paristhitivigyaanshasri arthur tansle ne baad main, is shabd ko parishkrut karte hue yah varnan diya "yah puri pranali


 na keval jeev-parisar he, lekin vah sabhi bhautik karkon kaa puraa parisar bhi shaamil hai jise ham paryaavaran kehete hai"
 Tansley considered ecosystems not only as natural units, but also as "mental isolates"
 tansle ne baad main "ecotope" shabd ke prayog dwaara paaritantron ke sthanik had ko paribhaashit kiya
 The main idea of the ecosystem concept is that living organisms influence every other element in their local environment
 ujin odum, paristhitiki ke ek sansthaapak ne kaha:" ek ikai jisamen sabhi jeev shaamil hon jo bhautik vaataavaran ko prabhavit karen ki pranali ke bheetar urja kaa ek pravaah spasht rup se paribhaashit poshan sanrachana, biotic vibhinnata or saamagree chakra ek paristhitiki tantra he
 "the human ecosystem concept is then based on the interpretation of human / nature bifurcation and on the basis that all species are ecologically integrated with each other and with the biotic organisms of their biotopes
 biom ek paristhitiki tantra ke samaan he jisamen ek mausami or bhugolic drushti se paribhaashit kiya gaya paristhitiki samaan jalwaayu paristhitiyon ke kshetra jaise ki paudhon, pashuon ke samudaayon or mitti avyav ke rup main aksar paaritantr ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures, leaf type, plant spacing, and climate
 ichosone ke asmaan, biom, vargeekaran, anuvanshik yaa aitihaasik samanthaayen ke aadhaar par paribhaashit nahin kiya jaataa
 Biomes are often identified with particular samples of ecological sequence and climatic vegetation

 The CBD defines "ecosystem" as: "a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microbe communities and their inanimate environment that function as a functional unit
" " Along with the need to conserve ecosystems, there was a political need to describe them and identify them efficiently
 Vryugdenhil and Sab say that using a physiognomic-ecological classification system can be achieved most effectively because Ecosystems are easily identifiable on satellite images along the region
 unhone kaha ki sambandhit vanaspati ke sanrachana or mausam-tatv, paristhitik data se purit prayek aaparivartak nirdharak hai jo aanshik rup se alag set prajatiyon ko alag karte hai
 This is true not only for plant species, but also for animal species, fungi and bacteria
 paritantr ke pahchaan kii maatra fisiognomik aaparivartak ke adheen he jise ek chhavi or / yaa kshetra main pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Special fauna elements may be added where necessary, such as seasonal concentrations of animals and distribution of coral reefs
 kai fisiognomik-paristhitik vargeekaran pranaliyaan uplabdh hai: Several aquatic classification systems are available, an effort being made by the United States Geological Survey and the inter-american Biodiversity Information Network to design an entire ecosystem classification system that will cover both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
 vigyaan ke pariprekshya se, paaritantr asatat ikayan nahin hai jo keval ek "sahi" vargeekaran drushtikon kaa adhikaar par pahchaane ja sakaten hai
 An attempt by Tensley to describe or classify the ecosystem in agreement with this definition must be clear about the observer / analyst investment in classification, including normative reasoning
 "moulik jivan-aadhaar sevaayen jinpar maanav sabhyataa nirbhar karata he," or yah pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh ho unhen paristhitiki tantra sevaayen kehete hai

 This reduces the impact that the structure of the ecosystem is fundamentally changed to a different state before

 The difference between collapse or a benign rebound is determined by two factors - the toxicity of the starting element and the resilience of the original ecosystem

 Thus, an ecosystem results from the sum of the organism's individual responses to stimuli from the elements in this environment

 Stochastists identify some internal regulation mechanisms that occur in nature

 Andrewatha or santi kii he ki kshetreey vyavhaar ke str par, jahaan khaadya aapurti ek simit kaarak nahin he aabaadiyon rakhane ke liye jaataa he kaa suzav dete hai
 Therefore, stochastists view regional behavior at the ecosystem level as a regulatory mechanism rather than at the species level
 Thus, in their view, ecosystems are not regulated by the system itself and feedback mechanism and there is no such thing as a balance of nature

 In the absence of an equilibrium of nature, ecosystems have species composition, but the entire ecological collapse that will undergo change will depend on the nature of the changes that will probably be rare events

 Stalinism is not the name of any ideology or any philosophical concept
 mote taur par samyavaadee samaaj ke nirmaan ke liye joseph stallin dwaara soviet sangh main apanaayi gayi nitiyon kaa samucchy hi stallinavaad kehalaata he
 It gradually developed into a political phenomenon in the three decades following the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the death of its leader Lenin
 chunki 1927 se lekar 1956 ke bich soviet communist party ke pramukh rahe joseph stallin ke jivan main hi kuch buddhijiviyon ne marxvad-leninavaad-stallinavaad naamak nayi vichaardhaara kaa sutrikaran karne kaa kamjor sa prayaas kiya tha
 An example of this is found in an article by Karl Radek published in Pravda, December 1934
 par is ravaiye ko na to stallin ne protsaahit kiya or na hi soviet communist party ke anya siddhantkaron ne
 Nevertheless, it got the name of Stalinism due to Stalin's intellectual and political personality present at the center of this phenomenon
 ise do tareeke se samajha ja saktaa he : soviet sangh main stallin ke netritv main tees saal tak chali samaajwaad ke nirmaan kii pariyojna ke taur par or is daur se nikali vaicharik or santhnik pravritiyon ke rup main jinhone sari duniya main marxvaadi raajnneeti ko kisi na kisi rup main prabhavit kiya
 Within the Marxist movement, there is a strong controversy about Stalin's role in Soviet history and evaluating Stalin's influence on marxism-leninism
 is lihaaz se sari duniya ke marxvaadi teen hisson main bante hue hai : ek hissaa vah he jo stallinavaad ko puri tarah se sweekaarte hue use marxvad kaa pramukh vyaavhaarik rup qaraar detaa he, doosraa hissaa use puri tarah se kaarij karte hue marxvaadi prayog kii tyajya vikruti qaraar detaa he or teesraa hissaa vah he jo stallinavaad ke prabhaav ko aam taur par prerak or sakaaratmak maanane ke baavjood uske kuch pahaluon kii aalochana karata he 
 In the non-marxist parts of the Left and other ideological circles, Stalinism is seen as a totalitarian trend that established a highly violent and oppressive state
 party kaaryakrttaaon ke bich stallin ke naam pukaare jane vaale joseph vissiarowich jugashvili kaa janm jiorgia main 21 disambar 1879 ko ek garib mochi ke ghar main hua tha
 He was educated in a religious seminary in Tbilisi, where he often faced punishment due to his revolutionary tendencies
 1899 main ve peshewar krantikari ho kar marxvaadi andolan main sakriy bhagidaari karne lage
 a skilled organizer and a mastery of underground political work, Stalin gained prominence in revolutionary circles
 1904 se hi unhone khud ko lenin or bolshevikon ke saath jod liya or 1912 main bolshevik kendriya samiti ke sadsy bane
 Between 1902 and 1917, Stalin was arrested countless times, given lengthy sentences and expelled several times
 1913 main unhen pakad kar siberia ke sudur uttari ilaake main bhej diya gaya jahaan se unki rihaai 1917 kii farvari kranti ke baad hi ho paayi
 Stalin held several key positions in the party immediately after the Bolshevik Revolution and during the Civil War
 paulitte beuro ke sabase shuruaati sadasyon main se ek stallin ko 1922 main party kaa mahasachiv niyukt kiya gaya
 He was the only leader of the party emerging from the lowest strata of the society to the highest positions
 janvari, 1924 main lenin kii mrityu ke baad unhone ek-ek karke apni nitiyon kaa virodh karne vaale trotski, zinoviv or buchaarin ko parajeet kiya or 1929 ke ant tak soviet party or rajya ke sarvocch netaa ke rup main ubhare
 Stalin died on March 5, 1953
 stallin ke aalochak aksar unhen keval jod-tod main maahir or maamuli bauddhik kshamtaaon vaale netaa ke rup main pesh karte hai
 But his work Anarchism or Socialism, which criticized Prince Kropatkin's ideas in 1906 itself? Was published
 unke saidhantik lekhan kii visheshta thi behad saral abhivyakti jiske kaaran vah kaaryakrttaaon ke bich kaafii pasand kiya jaataa tha
 Stalin is primarily known for the principle of establishing socialism in a country without a world revolution
 1924 ke baad se stallin ne apane is tark ko majboot karne vaala lekhan or vishleshan kiya
 It is often simplified to view Stalinism as a man of Stalin, but it is important to understand the structural reasons behind this political phenomenon
 bolshevik kranti ke parinamswaroop sthapit hui communist satta do virodhabhasi ayaamon se mil kar bani thi
 On the one hand, there were aspects of direct participation of the general public in the form of Soviets in which direct democracy was reflected
 loktantr kaa yah rup pashchimi deshon main viksit ho rahe bazaar aadhaarit udaarataavaadi loktantr se behatar or radical lagata tha
 On the other hand, a new emerging system was being guided and controlled by a disciplined worker based Communist Party
 is party kii bagdor lenin ke haath main thi jo sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee, loktantric cendravaad or krantikari haraval daste ke aadhaar par bani party kii bhoomika main yakeen rakhte the
 In his work Left Communism: a Childish Merge, published in 1920, he made it clear what the order of sequence of Soviet power would be
 sabase upar netaa, phir party, phir mazdoor varg or phir janata
 The responsibility of Stalinism, which flourished in the backdrop of the supremacy of the leader and the party, can be attributed to some ideological trends as well as to the extraordinary coincidence of the peoples of our country
 1918-21 ke bich chale grih yuddh, uske baad ke do varshon or phir 1924-27 ke bich kii avadhi ko itihaaskaaron ne ‘sarvasattavadi loktantr’ kaa virodhabhasi naam diya he
 It is believed that the seed of Stalinism fell on this stage
 baad ke saalon main pashchimi takaton dwaara pehle samaajawaadee rajya kii ‘poonjeewaadi or samrajyavaadee gherebandi’ kaa muqabla karne ke naam par kai tarah ke sansthagat or vaicharik taur-tareeke ijad kiye gayi
 Except for a few of these, Stalin was not responsible for himself
 lenin kii mrityu ke baad party ke sheersh netritv main shaamil unke tatkaaleen saathi or satta ke liye unase hode karne vaale netaa bhi un adhinayakawadi or damankaaree pravritiyon kii shuruyaat main bhagidaar the jinke aadhaar par aane vaale samay ke liye soviet rajya kii vyaavhaarik neenv rakhi ja rahi thi
 Russian scholar Mikhail Ilyin has divided the development of the phenomenon of Stalinism into several stages
 soviet party ke bheetar kai saal tak chale gahan satta- sangharsh kaa ant disambar, 1927 main hui party congress ke rup main hua
 He has labeled this period as nascent Stalinism
 bachakaana vampanth ke marz kii aalochana karte hue lenin ne trotski dwaara pravartit satat kranti kii thisis se asahmati vyakt kii thi
 Five years before this, Lenin had shown the opposite of the established Marxist view in one of his articles that due to uneven economic-political development, efforts would have to be made to establish socialism in some countries or in the same country
 1921 main hui dasvin congress se hi party main ‘parjing’ arthath virodh kii awaz uthaane waalon kaa nishkasana karke party kii safaai kaa chalan shuru ho gaya tha
 Stalin, who attained a central position as party general secretary in 1922, added the idea of establishing socialism in a country in the second edition of his work The Foundations of Leninism in 1924 only by understanding this analysis of Lenin
 stallin ke samakaleen soviet siddhantkaar nikolai buchaarin ne bhi is vichaar kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki agar duniya ke pehle samaajawaadee rajya ko faujee suraksha kii guarantee di ja sake to ek desh main samaajwaad kii rachana kii ja sakati he
 Stalin liberated the party from opponents of his policies until the Fifteenth Congress, using the purging repeatedly
 party ke prayek pad par niyukti unke haath main aa gayi or unhone kshetreey party cametiyon main vishesh vibhaag sthapit kiye taaki har tarah kii niyuktiyon kii kadi nigaraanee kii ja sake
 Thus by 1927, the way of establishing totalitarian rule as a party-state in the Soviet Union was completely cleared
 duusare daur ko udiyaman stallinavaad kaa naam diya gaya he jo 1930 tak chalaa
 This was the time of industrialization, the collectivization of agriculture and the beginning of the Five Year Plans
 arthvyavastha puri tarah se rajya ke niojit niyantran main chali gayi
 Any separate identity on the surface of society was considered anti-soviet
 samaroopikaran kaa bolbalaa ho gaya
 These moves led to opposition within the party, which led Stalin to campaign vigorously from 1929 to 30 in the party
 kareeb ek lakh communist nikaal diye gayi
 Some ten percent of the old members were removed and new industrial workers were made members of the party
 1930-34 kii avadhi ko shuruaati stallinavaad qaraar dete hue ilyin ne bataaya he ki is daur main stallin ne varg sangharsh ko or tikhaa karne kii ghoshnaa karte hue yah dikhaane kii koshish kii ki samaajwaad ko poonjeewaadi sazishon se bachaane ke liye raajnneetik virodhiyon ke kilaaf chal rahaa damanchakra kis tarah zaruri he
 In 1933, the phase of purging once again took place and 18 percent of the party members were removed
 lekin is baar unki jagah naye sadasyon kii bhartee nahin kii gayi
 The period 1934–41 was of complete Stalinism
 is daur main stallin kii vyakti-puja ko badhaava diya gaya
 This period of Stalinism is also known for the prosecutions of some of the important leaders of the Bolshevik revolution
 in mukademon main buchaarin or kamenev jaise netaaon ko apane aparaadh sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor karke maut kii sazaa di gayi
 In the same period the phenomenon of Nomenkletura emerged
 yah ek latin shabd tha jiskaa matlab tha naamon kii suchi
 Nomenkletura included workers and leaders for various committees through a process of advance nominations
 is suchi main naam aane kaa matlab tha ki vah vyakti party- pranali dwaara niyantrit rahegaa, party jab chaahegi use hataa degi, padonnati karegi yaa use haashiye par phenk diya jayega
 Milovan Districts criticized Stalinism and called Nomenkletura a new class
 lekin soviet sangh main shashan chalaane waalon kaa yah tabaka mukhyatah party or prashasnic mashinari ke bich pul kaa kaam karata tha
 It was a major part of the government's system of control and mobilization
 isane rajya kii sanstha ko ek prashasnic bandobast main simit karke rakh diya
 After 1936, a 'struggle against the traitors of the public' started in place of party-purging
 yah ‘sangharsh’ nikolai yezove ke netritv main karyrat aantarik maamalon ke mantralay kii dekharekh main chalane vaali sikret police ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 By 1938, Yezhov, under the direct orders of Stalin, fiercely oppressed the state
 dwitiya vishwa-yuddh main soviet party-rajya pranali kii faujee jeet ne stallin kii vyakti-puja ko jabardast oochaal diya
 As a result of the world war, the Soviet Union got the status of the second superpower of the world along with America
 1945-52 ke bich kaa daur viksit stallinavaad mana jaataa he jisamen stallin ke netritv main duniya ke paimaane par ek samaajawaadee khemaa ubhara
 In this era, Marxism was declared a science and all types of sciences were included in it
 prakritik vigyaanon se nikali daleelon ke zariye dwandvatmak bhautikwaad or aitihaasik bhautikwaad ko pusht kiya jane laga
 Stalin himself led campaigns about many types of science
 isi dauraan bhashaa-vigyaan par khud unki pustika prakashit hui
 Communist International ie Comintern played a significant role in making Stalinism the dominant trend of world communist movement outside the Soviet Union
 isaki sthapana bolshevik kranti kii prishthbhumi or madhya europe main chal rahi krantikari ubhaar kii paristhitiyon main lenin dwaara 1919 main kii gayi thi
 In order to become a member of it, every Communist Party had to declare itself free from reformists and middlemen
 duusare, keval ve hi partiyaan isaki sadsy ban sakati thim jo kathor anushaasan or sanghathan ke atyant kendrikrut niyamon kaa paalan karte hue khuli raajnneeti ke saath-saath bhumigat raajnneeti kaa bhi talmail baithaati hon or jo apane desh kii senaaon main bhi communist prachaar chalaati hon
 The way Stalin was creating socialist economy and social relations in the Soviet Union, Comintern tried to run its member communist parties on exactly the same pattern
 1952 main teraa saal ke antaraal ke baad unnisvin party congress hui jisamen stallin ne party-rajya pranali main kai tarah ke sudhaaron kii bhoomika baandhi
 Stalin had reported to Jyarji Malenkov by not presenting himself a report on the activities of the party in this Congress
 kuch logon kaa khyaal tha ki yah parjing ke naye daur kii taiyaari he
 In fact, it was a preparation for the latter Stalinism that was to begin the new preparations to be made in the light of the post-world War role of the Soviet Union
 lekin march, 1953 main stallin kii mrityu ke baad party ke bheetar satta-sangharsh shuru ho gaya jisamen nikita khrushchev stallin ke uttaradhikari ke rup main ubhare
 Khrushchev saw that the economy has been modernized under Stalinism, but agriculture is in a bad state and consumers do not even have the basics
 unhone soviet vyavastha ko stallinavaad ke prabhaav se mukt karne kaa abhiyaan chalaaya taaki use aarthik rup se adhik kaamyaab banaaya ja sake
 He described the purging done by Stalin as anti-marxism-leninism
 haalaanki kai prekshkon kii us samay bhi manyata thi ki soviet pranali ne jo rup le liya he, usamen kisi tarah kaa sudhaar karnaa takreeban naammumkin he

 Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a salicylate drug, often used as a pain reliever to relieve mild pains, antipyretic to reduce fever and as an anti-inflammatory drug
 is
 aspirin kaa ek platelet-virdohi prabhaav bhi hota he, jo thrambaksen utpaadan ke avrodh se utpann hota he, jo saamaanya paristhitiyon main plateleton ke anuon ko aapas main baandhakar rakt nalikaaon ke bheetar kii bhittiyon par hui chot par ek chakatte kaa nirmaan karata he
 Since platelet rash can become large enough to cause blockage in the bloodstream at or near that location, the use of aspirin in people with a high risk of developing blood clots in small amounts for long-term heart attacks, brain- It is also used to prevent stroke and blood clots
 yah bhi paaya gaya he ki hridayaghat ke turant baad thodi maatra main aspirin dekar ek or hridayaghat yaa hriday ke utak kii mrityu kaa jokham kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The main unwanted side effects of aspirin, especially when taken in excess, include gastric and intestinal blisters, gastric bleeding, and ear ache
 bacchon or kishoron main reiz syndrome ke jokham ke kaaran, flu jaise lakshanon yaa choti chechak yaa anya virus rogon ke lakshanon ke niyantran ke liye ab aspirin kaa istemaal nahin kiya jaataa
 Aspirin is the first member of a class called nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, not all of which are salicylates, although they all have a similar effect and mostly inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase
 aaj, aspirin duniya kii sabase adhik istemaal kii jane vaali aushadhiyon main se ek he, jisaki anumaanit 40,000 ton maatra prativarsh khai jaati he
 In countries where aspirin is a registered trademark of Bayer, its generic name is acetyl salicylic acid
 ek french chemist, charles fredrick jerheart ne pehali baar 1853 main acetilaselicylic acid banaai
 During his work on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides he mixed acetyl chloride with sodium salts of salicylic acid
 ek joardaar pratikriya hui or pighla hua yogic jaldi hi jam kar thos main parinit ho gaya
 Since there was no compositional theory in those days, Gerhardt named the compound salicylic-acetic anhydride
 
 aspirin kaa yah utpaadan jerheart dwaara enhydron par uske paper ke liye kii gai anek pratikriyaaon main se ek tha or usne iske aage or kuch nahin kiya
 After six years, in 1859 von Gillam obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid by reaction of salicylic acid and acetal chloride
 1869 main, shrouyder, prinzharn or crot ne jerheart or won gilm, donon ke sanshlepanon ko dobaaraa kiya or bataaya ki in donon pratikriyaaon se ek hi yogic –acetile salicylic acid praapt hota he
 He first demonstrated its correct composition — as an acetyl group linked to phenolic oxygen
 1897 main, aushadhi or daai kii form bear ke vaigyanikon ne acetile salicylic acid ke un dinon aam salicyllette davaaiyon ke kam-vikshobhak pratisthaapan ke rup main jaanch shuru kii
 By 1899, Bayer had named it aspirin and began selling it worldwide
 aspirin naam acetile or spirsor–salicylic acid kaa ek purana naam – se praapt kiya gaya he
