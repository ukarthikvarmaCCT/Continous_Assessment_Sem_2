 The world's first human heart transplant was performed on 3 December 1967 by Christian Bernard in the city of Cape Town, South Africa
 There are 3500 heart transplants every year all over the world and there are about 8 xxrep 5 0 people who are suffering from heart failure category and need new organs
 This inequality has inspired us a lot since 1993 to research for the use of non-human heart
 Now it is possible that we can apply the heart of another species or the heart created by man to the heart patient even though its performance is less successful than allograft
 Engineers also want that in the next 15 years these manufactured problems should be removed

 a typical heart transplant is triggered by receiving a heart with a suitable donor who has recently been declared dead or whose brain has been declared dead
 The transplant coordinator patient meets the hospital nurse who asks her to come to the hospital so that she can be evaluated and given the medicine before surgery
 At the same time, the heart is taken out of the donor's body and a team of surgeons inspects it to see if it is in the right position to be transplanted
 Sometimes this is considered inappropriate
 Sometimes it is a very worrying experience for an emotionally unstable patient and they need emotional support before going home
 The patient also goes through a lot of emotional, psychological, physical tests to make sure they are all good
 He is in mental health and will make good use of his heart

 The orthotopic procedure exposes the surgeon's sternum piercing medium to mediastinum
 The pericardium opens and the great vessels are cut and the patient is attached for cardiopulmonary bypass
 The unsuccessful heart is removed by performing a transaction, the pulmonary vein is not cut, but is left in the vein of a circular part
 The donor's heart is trimmed so that it fits into the patient's left atrium and great vessels
 When the new heart is on, the patient is released from cardiopulmonary bypass and the cine is switched off

 Doctors made history in Germany in February 2006 by transplanting a beating heart
 Normally potassium chloride is injected into a donor's heart to stop its heartbeat before it leaves the donor's body in ice Cook and keep it properly
 Ice can usually keep the heart fresh for four to six hours, depending on the condition of the heart
 Instead of cooling the heart, a new method has come out which is a machine in which the heart is kept according to the temperature of the body and it keeps on beating and hot blood flows in it
 It can maintain the heart refreshed in a suitable condition for much longer than the traditional method

 Fuel cells use hydrogen as fuel, powering an electric battery when its capacity is exhausted
 cheverlyt equinox FCEV, ford age hisiris drive or honda FCX, eendhan cell / vidyut hybrid ke udhaaharan hai
 Hybrid vehicles typically have greater fuel savings and lower emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles, resulting in lower emissions
 is tarah kii bachat ek vishisht hybrid dizin ke teen tatwon dwaara praathmik taur par hasil kii jaati he: Other technologies, which are not required for 'hybrid' features, but which are often found in hybrid vehicles, are as follows: ye suvidhaayen ek hybrid vaahan ko vishesh rup se shahar ke yatayaat ke liye zyada kushal banaati hai, jahaan baar-baar rukaawat, vaahan ko kinare lagane or band rakhane kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 For continuous high-speed highway use, these features are much less useful in reducing noise emissions

 In an environment when low emissions and improved fuel savings are prevalent in automotive needs, it is believed that the practical use of hybrid, electric and fuel cell vehicles will continue to grow
 Lithium-ion batteries are more preferred, as they have the highest energy density among any rechargable batteries, producing a huge amount of power at the same time, and generating three times more voltage than a nickel metal hydride battery cell

 As this content keeps on changing or updating, the compiler has to constantly monitor the draft feed
 is lekh main agrigater ke liye sankalak shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, par dhyaan rahe ki yah maanak shabd nahin he
 The syndicated draft that the compiler accepts is usually provided in RSS or any other formatted format such as RDF or Atom

 Once a feed has been subscribed or become a regular reader, the compiler locates the new content at fixed intervals according to the user's wish and delivers the content to it
 is takanic ko pul taknalaji kaha jaataa he
 This is the exact opposite of push technology used in tools such as email or instant messaging
 saath hi push takanic se saamagree ke graahakon kii tulana main sankalak badi saralata se kisi bhi feed se anasbsakraib kar saktaa he yani uskaa pathak banane se inkaar kar saktaa he
 Most compilers also allow the user to export and import a list of feeds read by his or other readers in OPML format

 This feature is also available on modern web browsers and email programs

 In some cases, it can also load these files directly into portable media players such as ipods connected to computers

 Web-based compilers are applications that are located on remote servers and are used on a network of applications such as Google Reader or bloglines
 chunki ye anuprayog internet ke madhyam se prayukt hote hai atah prayokta apni sabsakribd feed ko jahaan bhi internet sampark uplabdh ho vahaan pard saktaa he
 Modern compilers use technologies like Agax and are also available as multiple widgets
 vyaktigat sankalkon ke alaava saamudayik sankalak bhi hote hai jo saamanytah kisi laghu samudaay ke feed kaa sankalan karte hai
 For example, see the page of the list of compilers at the end of the article
 clyant yaa desktop anuprayog kaa zyaadaatar computer par baqayda sthaapan kiya jaataa he
 Their graphical user interface is similar to most popular email clients such as Outlook, with a draft showing in most three panels, a list of subscribed feeds on the left, which can be grouped into groups, folders, or squares, and a draft entry in the right panel
 kai anuprayogon main tikar tepe yaa news tikar yaa alert ke rup main nai pravishtiyon ke bare main jaankaree hasil kii ja sakati he
 Many programming languages provide libraries that application builders or website owners can read feeds using or display or use in different formats

 Media compilers, also known as podcatchers due to the popularity of podcasts, are compilers of feeds in which the draft is primarily audio or video
 feed main ye ke rup main daale jate hai
 These can be mesh or desktop based applications
 ye media ko downlod kar use chalaa sakate hai yaa ypod jaise kisi bahari media player ke saath sikronies bhi kar sakate hai
 Content redundancy is a fundamental problem with compilers, especially if the user is a reader of multiple feeds
 sankalak alag alag taur par is samasya se nibatate hai
 In addition to facilitating the categorization of feeds to the user, they take advantage of the tags and keywords attached to the entries
