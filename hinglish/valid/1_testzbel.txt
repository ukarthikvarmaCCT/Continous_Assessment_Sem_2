 Famous historian and biographer Thomas Carlile called it "the life of a person" in a very simple and concise definition
 is tarah kisi vyakti ke jivan vrittanton ko sachet or kalatmak dhang se likh daalana jeevancharit kaha ja saktaa he
 Although history is to some extent, in the opinion of some people, the biography of great men, however, the living is different from it in a sense
 jeevancharit main kisi ek vyakti ke yatharth jivan ke itihaas kaa aalekhan hota he, anek vyaktiyon ke jivan kaa nahin
 Still, the author of the biography cannot live without coming close to the duties of the historian and artist

 There are many environmental problems in India
 vaayu pradooshan, jal pradooshan, kachra, or prakritik paryaavaran ke pradooshan bharat ke liye chunautiyon hai
 From 1947 to 1995, the condition of the environmental problem was very bad
 1995 se 2010 ke bich vishwa bank ke visheshgyon ke adhyayan ke anusaar, apane paryaavaran ke muddon ko sambodhit karne or apane paryaavaran kii gunvattta main sudhaar laane main ke anusaar bharat duniya main sabase teji se pragati kar rahaa he
 Nevertheless, India has a long way to go to reach the level of a similar environment in coming to the level of countries with developed economies
 bharat ke liye ek badi chunauti or avasar he
 Environmental problems are the main cause of disease, health issues and long-term impact on livelihood for India

 India's population growth exacerbates environmental problems and pressures for its resources
 jansankhya vruddhi or paryaavaran ke bich baatcheet ke bare main adhyayan or bahes kaa ek lanbaa itihaas he
 According to Malthus, a British thinker, for example, a growing population is putting pressure on agricultural land, forcing environmental degradation, and forcing poor land as well as poor land to cultivate 
 yah paryaavaran ksharan antat, krishi paidaavaar or khaadya padaarthon kii uplabdhta ko kam kar detaa he, jisase jansankhya vruddhi kii dar ko kam karne, akaal or rogon or mrityu kaa kaaran banataa he 
 It can stress the potential of the environment
 Population growth is also seen as a major cause of air, water, and solid waste pollution
 1980 ke dashak ke baad se, bharat ke sarvocch nyaayalay samarthak sakriy rup se bharat ke paryaavaran ke muddon main laga hua he
 The Supreme Court of India is engaged in interpreting and directly introducing new changes in environmental jurisprudence

 louh ayask ve chattaane or khanij hai jinase dhatvik louh kaa aarthik nishkarshan kiya ja saktaa he
 These ores usually contain high amounts of iron oxides and can range in color from dark gray, bright yellow, dark purple, and rust red
 louh aamtaur par magnetit, hametit, joithait ), lymonite 
 n), or siderite, is found as
 hametit ko "prakritik ayask" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The name dates back to the early years of mining, when specific haematite ores contained 66% iron and were directly dumped into iron-making blast furnaces
 louh ayask kaccha maal he, jiskaa upyog pig aayran banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo ispaat banane ke liye banane main kaam aata he
 In fact, it has been argued that iron ore is "probably more integral to the global economy than any other commodity, except oil
" " The presence of metallic iron on the surface of the earth is virtually unknown, but it is found in iron – nickel alloys found from meteors and sometimes in deep mantle xenoliths
 isliye, maanav udyogon ke dwaara kaam main liye jane vaale louh ke sabhi strot louh oxide khanij hi hote hai, udyog main kaam main liye jane vaala praarambhik rup hametit he
 However, in some situations, low-grade sources of iron ore were used by industrialized societies when high-grade hematite ore was not available
 isamen shaamil he, sanyukt rajya america main dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad taconite kaa upyog or america kranti or nepolian ke yuddh ke dauraan joithait or yaa bog ayask kaa upyog
 In prehistoric society, latrite was used as a source of iron ore
 magnetic kaa upyog aksar isliye kiya jaataa he kyonki yah chumbakeey hota he or isliye ise geng se aasaani se mukt kiya ja saktaa he
 Low-grade sources of iron ore usually require purification
 silikets ke saapeksh hametit ke ucch ghanatv ke kaaran, shuddhikaran ke liye aamtaur par ise chote tukdon main toda jaataa he, iske baad ise pisa jaataa he or baari taral pruthakkaran kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 For this, well-grounded ore is fed over a solution containing bentonite or some other agent, thereby increasing the density of the solution
 jab vilyan kaa ghanatv upyukt str tak pahunch jaataa he, hametit dub jaataa he or silicket khanij sataha par tairne lagata he or ise sataha se hataa kar alag kiya ja saktaa he
 Iron ore mining methods depend on the type of ore
 vartmaan main chaar mukhya prakaar ke louh ayask bhandar paae jate hai, jo ayask ke bhandar ke bhu vigyaan or khanij vigyaan par nirbhar karte hai
 These are magnetite, titenomagnetite, passive hematite and pisolitic ironstone deposits
 bandhit louh kaa nirmaan ) kayantarit avsaadee chattaanon se hota he jo mukhya rup se louh khanij or silica kii patali paraton se bani hoti hai
 The iron mineral present in it may be carbonate siderite, but the mineral used as iron ore contains oxide magnetite or hematite
 bandhit louh nirmaan ko uttari america main taconite ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 BIF mining involves extensive crushing and screening, followed by fine-graining with crushing, allowing the ore to be in such a state that the crystallized magnetite and quartz become so fine that when the resulting powder is placed in a magnetic separator The quartz is left behind when it flows through
 khanan kii prakriya main ayask or vyarth padaarthon kii badi maatra kii gatividhiyaan shaamil hai
 The waste is in two forms, the rocks from the mine which are not ores, which is called mulok, and the undesired mineral which itself is the inner part of the ore, which is called geng
 mulok ko khan se nikaal kar vyarth padaarth ke rup main alag kar diya jaataa he or geng ko shuddhikaran yaa parishkaran kii prakriya ke dauraan alag kiya jaataa he or avshesh ke rup main ayask main se hataaya jaataa he
 Taconite residues are mostly mineral quartz, which are chemically inert
 is saamagree ko bade, viniyamit sthir pani ke talabon main sangrahit kar liya jaataa he
 The main points that make magnetite economically useful are the crystalline properties of magnetite, the range of iron in BIF nutrient rocks, and the contaminating elements present in concentrated magnetite
 adhikansh magnetit sroton kaa aakaar or pattee anupaat apraasangik hota he kyonki BIF kaa nirmaan sainkadon meter motaa hota he, isamen sainkadon kilometre kii paraten hoti hai, jisamen aasaani se 2,500 million yaa adhik ton ayask ho saktaa he
 The typical range of iron in which magnetite is economically suitable with bonded iron formation is roughly 25% Fe
 jisase saamanyatya 33% se 40% magnetit kii prapti kii ja sakati he, jo 64% sandrit louh kaa utpaadan kar saktaa he
 0 in typical concentrated magnetite iron ore
 1%se kam phosphorus, 3–7% silica or 3% se kam aluminium hota he
 The size of the magnetite particles and its fraction according to the mass of the silica determines the extent to which the rock is crushed so that the magnetic separation process can be carried out effectively to provide a high-purity concentrated magnetite
 isse yah nirdhaarit hota he ki ek milling prakriya ke liye kitni maatra main urja kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Typically, most magnetite BIF deposits are powdered so that the size of the particles varies from 32 to 45 micrometers, so that concentrated magnetite with less silica can be obtained
 sandrit magnetic main saamanyatya bhaar kaa 63% Fe hota he or aamtaur par kam phosphorus, kam aluminium, kam titanium or kam silica hote hai or ek premium keemat par isaki maang hoti he
 Currently magnetite iron ore is mined in the United States in Minnesota and Michigan, and taconite is mined in eastern Canada
 BIF se yukt magnetic kaa khanan vartmaan main vishesh rup se brazil main kiya jaataa he, jo kaaphi adhik maatra main ise asia ko niryaat kar detaa he or australia main ek nayaa or bada magnetit louh ayask udyog he
 Sometimes granite and ultrapotasic igneous rocks separate magnetite crystals and form magnetite bodies economically suitable for concentrating
 louh ke kuch bhandar, khaskar jo chile main hai, jwalamukhi ke pravaah se banate hai, jinamein magnetit ke lakshan praaroop crystalon kaa sangrah hota he
 Chile's iron ore deposits in the Atacama Desert create alluvial accumulations of magnetite in streams emanating from these volcanic formations
 ateet main kuch magnetic scorn or hydrothermal ke bhandar ucch shrenee ke louh ayask bhandar ke rup main kaam karte the jinhen bahut kam parishkaran kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi
 Malaysia and Indonesia also have several granite reserves of the same nature
 magnetit louh ayask ke anya sroton main prabhavi magnetit ayask ke kayantarit sanchay shaamil hai, jaise tasmania kii sawaj nadi main paae jane vaale ayask jinka nirmaan ophiolit ultramafiks ke katane se hota he
 Another minor source of iron ore is the accumulation of magma that freezes in layers, which typically contain magnetite ore containing titanium along with vanadium
 ye ayask ek aalaa darje kaa bazaar banaate hai, jinamein louh, titanium or venedium ke nishkarshan ke liye vishesh prakaar ke pragalkon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The purification of these ores is essentially similar to that of bonded iron manufacturing ores, but they can usually be refined more easily by crushing and screening
 praroopik sandrit titanomagnetit main 57% Fe, 12% Ti or 0
 5% is V2O5
 hametit louh ayask ke bhandar vartmaan main sabhi mahadwipon main prayukt kiye jate hai, inkaa sabase adhik upyog dakshin america, australia or asia main kiya jaataa he
 Most of the large hematite iron ore deposits are bonded iron formations produced by metamorphic conversion and can sometimes contain igneous deposits
 hametit louh aamtaur par BIF se yukt magnetit yaa anya chattaanon kii tulana main kam miltaa he, jo iskaa mukhya strot yaa protolith chattan banaate hai, parantu isse louh kaa nishkarshan sasta padataa he, kyonki isamen louh avyav kii ucch maatra hoti he, isliye ise shuddhikaran yaa parishkaran kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 However, hematite ores are harder than magnetite ores and therefore require more energy to crush and grind if purification is required
 hametit ayskon main anya avyavon kii ucch sandratha bhi ho sakati he, inamen praroopik rup se shaamil hai, phosphorus kii ucch maatra, jal or aluminium 
 Hematite ores of the export category are generally in the 62–64% Fe range
 china || 820 Iron is the most commonly used metal in the world, it is mainly used as steel, with iron ore being the main ingredient, which makes up about 95% of all metals used annually
 iskaa upyog mukhu rup se sanrachanaatmak abhiyantriki anuprayogon main or samudri prayojanon, automobiles or saamaanya audyogic anuprayogon main kiya jaataa he
 Iron or iron-rich rocks are found all over the world, but commercial mining activities of the ore category are mainly seen in a few countries, which are listed in the table
 louh ayask ke bhandar ke liye arthshaastra main mukhya baadha aavashyak rup se bhandar kii shrenee yaa aakaar nahin he, kyonki maujuud chattaanon ke paryaapt ton main bhaar ko bhu-vaigyanik rup se pramanit karne ke liye yah vishesh rup se sakht nahin he
 The main constraint is the relative position of iron ore in the market, the cost of rail infrastructure to bring it to market, and the cost of energy required to do so
 louh ayask kaa khanan ek adhik maatra main hone vaala kam laabh kaa vyapaar he, kyonki louh kii keemat aadhaar dhaatuon se bahut kam hoti he
 It takes a lot of capital and requires a lot of investment for railways like infrastructure, as it is used to transport ore from mine to ship
 inhen kaarnon se, louh ayask utpaadan kuch mukhya khiladiyon ke haathon main kendrit he
 The world produces an average of one billion metric tons of raw ore annually
 duniya kaa sabase bada louh ayask kaa utpaadak brazilian mining corporation wel he, jiske baad aglaa sthaan anglo-australian companiyon BHP bilitan or rio tinto group kaa he
 Another Australian supplier, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, has helped to bring Australia's production to second place in the world
 louh ayask samudr se hone vaala vyapaar, arthath, vah louh ayask jise jahaazon ke dwaara anya deshon ko le jaaya jaataa tha, vah 2004 main 849m ton tha
 Australia and Brazil dominate the maritime trade, making up 72 percent of the market
 BHP, rio or wel unke bich bazaar ke 66% par niyantran karte hai
 Iron ore in Australia is sourced from three main sources: Pisolite "channel iron deposits" ores originate from the mechanical erosion of primary bonded-iron formation and accumulate in alluvial channels such as Panavonica, Western Australia; And effective metamorphic bonded ironmaking-related ores such as Neumann, Chichester Range, Hummersley Range and Cullianobing, in Western Australia
 ayask ke anya prakaar bhi haal hi main saamne aaye hai, jaise oxikrut ferugines hardcaps, udhaaharan ke liye pashchimi australia main argyle jhil ke najadik letrit ayask ke bhandar
 The total recoverable reserves of iron ore in India are approximately 9602 million tonnes of hematite and 3408 million tonnes of magnetite
 madhya pradesh, karnataka, bihar, urisa, goa, maharashtra, andhra pradesh, kerala, rajasthan or tamilnadu louh ayask ke mukhya bhartiya utpaadak hai
 World consumption of iron ore is increasing by 10% annually
 Its main consumers are China, Japan, Korea and the United States and the European Union
 china vartmaan main louh ayask kaa sabase bada upabhokta he, jo duniya kaa sabase bada ispaat utpaadak desh he
 It is also the largest importer, which procured 52% of maritime trade of iron ore in 2004
 china ke baad aglaa sthaan japan or korea kaa he jo kachche louh ayask or dhaatukarm ke koyale kii kaaphi maatra kaa upbhog karte hai
 In 2006, China produced 588 million tonnes of iron ore, with an annual increase of 38%
 pichley 40 varshon main, louh ayask kii keemton ko, khanankartaaon or ispaat nirmaataaon ke bich, ek tathakthith benchmark pranali ke dwaara nirdhaarit kiya gaya he
 Traditionally, the first deal between these two groups set a benchmark that was followed by the rest of the industry
 is prakaar se, ek hi keemat par prati varsh ek baar baatcheet kii jaati he
 a spot market also exists, although it is traditionally much smaller
 is pranali ke saath samasya yah he ki jab spot keemten benchmark se zyada hoti hai, khanankartaaon ko atirikt rajasav nahin mil paata, jo ayask ko spot bazaar main bech kar kamaaya gaya hota he
 When spot prices are lower than the benchmark, some steel mills cheat by purchasing their ore from the spot market
 duusare shabdon main, benchmark pranali steel milon ko suraksha pradaan karti he lekin khanankartaaon ko nahin
 On the other hand, the benchmark system brings price stability for miners and steel mills, allowing them to plan their production more effectively
 haal hi ke varshon main, benchmark pranali tuutane lagi he, kyonki kuch khanankarta apane graahakon ko spot bazaar kaa upyog karne ke liye prerit karte hai or sabase bade khariddaar, china, ke saath baatcheet gharshan kaa kaaran banati he
 Because the size and importance of the spot market has greatly increased, a means of avoiding financial constraints such as swaps in iron ore has arisen
 yah dekhte hue ki adhikansh anya thok kii vasteen ek bazaar aadhaarit mulya pranali ke rup main saamne aayin hai, yah ek uchit shart he ki louh ayask madhyam se lambi avadhi main isi path kaa anusaran karegaa
 However, in some cases, the cost of shipping exceeds the value of the ore
 yah vishesh rup se brazil ke louh ayask ke liye praasangik he, jise australian louh ayask kii tulana main china tak pahunchane ke liye adhik yatra kerani padati he
 Therefore, in the past Australian manufacturers argued for a premium on their ore, the reason being that it is too cheap to ship
 vartmaan main louh ayask ke bhandar kaaphi vishaal hai, parantu kuch logon kaa kahana he ki jis dar se iske upbhog main nirantar ghaateey vruddhi ho rahi he, isse yahaan tak ki is sansaadhan ke strot bhi simit ho sakate hai
 For example, World Watch Institute Lester Brown suggests that iron ore will last only 64 years, based on a very conservationist assessment, with an increase of 2% per year
 louh ayask main oxigen or louh ke parmaanu paraspar anu ke rup main bandhit hote hai
 It has to be smelled to convert it into metallic iron and it has to undergo a direct reduction process to remove oxygen from it
 oxigen-louh bandha bahut prabal hote hai or oxigen se louh ko alag karne ke liye, ek adhik prabal tatv kaa bandhan upasthit hona chahie jo oxigen ko apane saath jod sake
 Carbon is used for this because at higher temperatures the predominance of the carbon – oxygen bond is higher than that of the iron – oxygen bond
 is prakaar se, louh ayask ko pis kar coke ke saath milaayaa jaataa he or pragalan prakriya main ise jalaayaa jaataa he
 However, it is not as easy as it looks; Oxygen separating from iron first forms carbon mono oxide
 is prakaar se, louh or carbon ke pragalan kii prakriya ek alp oxigen kii avasthaa main kii jaati he jisase carbon jal kar cobanaye naaki CO2
 Even the very small amount of some elements found affects the behavior or smelting activity of iron ore greatly
 ye prabhaav achche bhi ho sakate hai or bure bhi, kuch to bahut adhik bure ho sakate hai
 Some chemicals, such as flux, are mixed deliberately to make the blast furnace action more effective
 anya ko isliye milaayaa jaataa he ve louh ko adhik taral banaate hai, yaa ise koi or vaanchhneeya gun dete hai
 The choice of ore, fuel, and fluxes determines how the slag behaves and what the characteristics of the iron produced will be
 adarsh rup se louh ayask main keval louh or oxigen hi hote hai
 In fact, this is rarely seen
 aamtaur par, louh ayask main kai tatv hote hai, jo aadhunik steel main aksar avaanchit hote hai
 Silica is almost always found in iron ore
 isamen se adhikansh silica pragalan kii prakriya main dhaatumal ke rup main alag ho jaataa he
 At temperatures above 1300 °, some get reduced and it alloys with iron
 bhatti jitani garm hoti he, louh main utana hi adhik silicon hota he
 1 in 16th to 18th century European cast iron
 5% tak silicon kaa paaya janaa asaamaanya nahin he
 The major effect of silicon is that it promotes the manufacture of gray iron
 dhoosar louh kam bhangur hota he or safed louh kii tulana main ise finnish dena aasaan hota he
 That is why it is preferred in the casting process
 Turner kii report ke anusaar silicon sankuchan ko bhi kam karata he, iske thanda hone ke samay nikalne vaali gas se hone vaale chhedon ko kam karata he or dhalaai ko adhik behatar banataa he
 Phosphorus has four major effects on iron: it increases its hardness and strength, lowers the temperature of solids, increases fluidity, helps in quick cooling
 louh kaa upyog kis prayojan ke liye kiya jayega, is aadhaar par yah acha yaa bura prabhaav daal saktaa he
 Bog ores often contain high amounts of phosphorus
 phosphorus ke sandran ke saath louh kii prabalata or kathorta bad jaati he
 0 in pig iron
 05% phosphorus ise madhyam carbon steel jaisaa kathor banaata he
 Iron containing more phosphorus can be hardened with hammers in cold
 phosphorus ke kisi bhi sandran ke liye kathorta kaa prabhaav sach he
 The more it contains phosphorus, the more iron becomes harder and can be made more rigid by hammers
 aadhunik ispaat nirmaataa kathorta ko 30% tak badha sakate hai, iske liye unhen phosphorus ke str ko 0
 07 and 0
 12% ke bich banaaye rakhana hota he or saath hi louh aghat rodhi bhi bana rahata he
 This further increases hardness due to quenching, but also reduces the solubility of carbon in iron at high temperatures
 yah blistor yaa fafoledaar ispaat ke nirmaan main isaki upyogita ko kam karata he, jahaan carbon ke avasorana kii maatra or gati bahut mahatvapurn hoti he
 There is also a low side of phosphorus found in iron
 0
 Iron is rapidly cooled over short periods when found in concentrations greater than 2%, or becomes brittle at low temperatures
 jaldi thanda hona vishesh rup se louh kii chadi main mahatvapurn he
 However, rod iron is usually used for heating, but must be hardened, easily bendable, and must also be shock resistant at room temperature
 ek keel jo ki ek hathode kii maar se tukade tukade hokar bikhar jaataa he yaa ek pahiyaa jo ek chattan se takaraa tut jaataa he, use bechney par acchhee keemat nahin milegi
 High concentrations of phosphorus can make any iron unusable
 jaldi thanda hone ke prabhaav taapmaana ke saath bad jate hai
 In this way, a piece of iron, which is completely useful in summer, can become very brittle in winter
 is baat ke pramaan hai ki madhya yug ke dauraan bahut amir log garmiyon main ucch phosphorus se yukt talwaar rakhte the or sardiyon main kam phosphorus se yukt talwaar rakhte the
 Careful control of phosphorus can be very beneficial in the casting process
 phosphorus taralata ke taapmaana ko kam karata he, jisase iquidus taapmaana depresses, loha ab or bad jaati he pighla hua dravtaa ke liye rahane ke liye anumati detaa he
 Increase of 1% volume would take the molten iron to double the distance
 adhiktam prabhaav, lagbhag 500 degree celsius, ko 10
 Is obtained at 2% concentrations
 foundry kaam ke liye turnar ne paaya ki adarsh louh main 0
 2-0
 55% phosphorus tha
 When the resulting iron was filled into the mold, it had fewer spaces and reduced contraction
 19 veen sadi main sajaavati kachche louh ke kuch utpaadakon ne 5% phosphorus se yukt louh kaa istemaal kiya
 The extreme liquidity helped them in a much more complex but delicate casting
 lekin, ve bhaar nahin le sakate the kyonki unamem prabalata nahin thi
 There are two treatments for high phosphorus iron
 purana he or aasaan, parihaar he
 If the iron produced by someone cools down quickly, it will find a near source of iron ore
 duusari vidhi main shaamil he louh oxide mila kar khanan kii prakriya ke dauraan phosphorus ko oxikrut kar dena
 This technique is generally related to puddling in the 19th century, which was probably not understood early
 udhaaharan ke liye marlboro aayran ke maalik ijak zaane ise 1772 main nahin jaan paae
 Zane is said to have been reputed for modern development, a technique unknown even to the Iron Masters of Virgina and Pennsylvania
 phosphorus ek hanikaarak sandushak he, kyonki yah ispaat ko bhangur banaata he, chaahe 0
 Only present in small concentrations of 6%
 phosphorus ko flux yaa pragalan kii sahaayta se aasaani se hataaya nahin ja saktaa or isliye louh ayask par kaam karne ke liye isamen phosphorus kii maatra kam honi chahie
 The iron pillar of India which does not rust is preserved by phosphoric composition
 phosphoric acid kaa upyog jang roopantarak ke rup main kiya gaya he, kyonki phosphoric louh oxikaran ke liye kam samvedansheel he
 Small amounts of aluminum are present in many ores and some lime stones
 pehle vaale ko hataane ke liye ayask ko pragalan se pehle dhoyaa jaataa he
 Before being put into a brick-lined furnace, aluminum contamination was so low that it had no effect on iron or clinker
 haalanki, jab bhattiyon ke tal or blast fernence ke astr aantarik banane ke liye eenton kaa upyog shuru hua, aluminium kii maatra naatakeey rup se bad gayi
 This was due to erosion of the internal level of the furnace by clinker
 aluminium kaa apchayan karnaa bahut mushkil hota he
 As a result, aluminum contamination of iron is not a problem
 haalanki, yah dhaatumal kii viscasita yaa shyanta ko badhaata he
 This has many adverse effects on the operation of the furnace
 ghanaa dhaatumal dhire aaweshit hoga or isse is prakriya main lagane vaala samay bad jayega
 Higher amounts of aluminum will also cause problems in removing the liquefied clinker
 charam par yah ek jami hui bhatti kaa karan banegaa
 Sinters containing more aluminum contain many solutions
 pehla he roak paanaa; adhik aluminium se yukt strot main ayask yaa chooney ke strot kaa upyog naa karen
 Viscosity will decrease as the ratio of lime flux increases
 sulfur yaa gandhak koyale main aksar paaya jane vaala ek sandooshak he
 It is found in small amounts in many ores, but can be removed by calcification
 louh ke pragalan main upasthit taapmaana par gandhak louh kii drav or thos donon avasthaaon main jaldi se pigal jaataa he
 The effects of very small amounts of sulfur or sulfur are immediate and severe
 in par sabase pehle louh nirmaataaon ke dwaara kaam kiya gaya
 Sulfur makes iron red and it heats up quickly
 louh jab jaldi garm hota he, to vah garm avasthaa main bhangur hota he
 This was a serious problem because the iron used during the 17th and 18th centuries was cast iron or bar iron
 dhalwaan louh ko aakaar dene ke liye garm avasthaa main baar baar hathode se peeta jaataa he
 a quickly heated iron piece will break when hit by a hammer
 jab garm lohe yaa steel kaa koi tukda tut jaataa he to khuli sataha turant oxikrut ho jaati he
 This layer of oxide hinders the repair of cracks by welding
 badi daraaren lohe yaa steel ke tut jane kaa kaaran banati hai
 Due to small cracks, the object cannot be used in time
 yah kitna jaldi garm hota he, yah upasthit gandhak kii maatra par nirbhar karata he
 0 currently
 03% se adhik sulfur se yukt louh kaa upyog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Quickly heated iron can work, but it works at low temperatures
 kam taapmaana par kaam karne ke liye smith yaa formen se adhik bhautik prayaas kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is more difficult to obtain a metal to achieve such a result
 ek alp gandhak se yukt baar kaam kar saktaa he, parantu iske liye adhik samay or prayaas kii zarurat hoti he
 Sulfur in cast iron promotes the formation of white iron
 keval 0
 Due to volume up to 5% it slowly cools down and high amount of silicon
 safed kaccha loha adhik bhangur hota he, lekin yah sakht bhi hota he
 This is generally avoided, as it is difficult to work on, except in China where cast iron containing high amounts of sulfur is 0
 57% se yukt hota he, yah koyale or coke se banaaya jaataa he or iskaa upyog ghantiyaan or jhankaar banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 0 in good foundry iron, according to Turner
 15
 Must contain less than percent sulfur
 shesh duniya main ucch sulfur se yukt kaccha louh dhalaai main kaam aa saktaa he, lekin yah buree gunvattta kaa dhalwaan louh banayega
 There are several methods of treating sulfur contamination
 pehla or itihaas main sabase zyada prayukt kiye jane vaala pragaitihaasik tarika he isse bachanaa
 Unlike China, coal was not used as a fuel for ignition in Europe, because it contains sulfur and therefore iron is quickly heated
 agar ek ayask se aisa dhaatu banataa he jo jaldi garm hota he, to yranmaster kisi duusare kii khoj karenge
 When mineral coal was first used in the European Blast Furnace in 1709, coke is added to it
 1829 se garm blast kii shuruyaat se pehle kachche koyale kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 Sulfur can be removed from the ore by roasting and washing
 bharjan se safar oxikrut ho jaataa he, jisase sulfur dioxide kaa nirmaan hota he, jo yaa to vaataavaran main ud jaataa he yaa ise dho kar hataaya ja saktaa he
 In hot climates it is possible that pyritic ore is released in the rainy season
 barsaat, jeevanu or ushma ke sanyukt prabhaav se sulphide oxikrut hokar sulphate banaate hai, jo pani main ghulansheel hai
 Although, historically, iron sulfide, a common iron mineral, was not used as an ore for the production of ferrous metals
 prakritik apkshay kaa upyog sweden main kiya jaataa tha
 This process, at geological speed, produces gossan limonite ore
 kam sulfur se yukt louh kaa mahatva nirantar unche mulyon ke dwaara pradarshit hota he, jiske liye 16 veen se 18 veen shatabdi se sweden, rus or spain ke louh ke bhugtan ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 Sulfur is currently not a problem
 aadhunik upachaar he mangneej kaa atirikt hona he
 However, the operator must know how much sulfur is in the iron, because five times the manganese must be added to it, so that it can discharge it
 kuch aitihaasik louh mangneej ke str ko disple karte hai, lekin adhikansh sulfur ko niraveshit karne ke liye aavashyak str se kam hote hai

 bada majalanic badal hamase 1,60,000 prakaash varsh dur he or chota majalanic badal hamase 1,80,000 prakaash varsh dur he
 Both can be seen with naked eyes in the southern hemisphere
 inaki upasthiti ko pehali baar 1519 me portugali anveshak ferdinand majalan dwaara darj kiya gaya tha
 Later he was named on them only
 majalanic badal do besangi bauni gallexiyaan hai jo hamaari gallexi, akashganga, kii upgrah hai or hamaari sameepi gallexiyon ke sthaneey samooh ke sadsy hai
 They can only be seen in the sky of the Earth from the Southern Hemisphere
 in do gallexiyon ke naam hai - If magellanic clouds are seen from the southern hemisphere of the earth without binoculars, then it seems to be the separated portions of the galaxy
 bade or chote majalanic badalon ke bich lagbhag 75,000 prakaash-varsh kii duuri he
 The largest magellanic cloud is 160,000 light-years away from the Earth, while the small magellanic cloud is 200,000 light-years away
 bade majalanic badal kaa aakaar lagbhag 14,000 prakaash-varsh he or chote vaale kaa keval 7,000 prakaash-varsh he
 These two are much smaller than the Milky Way

 Our algae have also been affected by both these galaxies and its outer spiral shape has become a bit crooked
 dekha gaya he ke in teenon gallexiyon ke bich hydrogen gas kii dharaayen bah rahi hai

 == purpose == for happiness and prosperity kisi shahar main lakhon log rahete the
 Everyone used to work in their respective works
 kisi ko kisi kii parvaah nahin thi
 Rites like bhajan-kirtan, bhakti-bhava, mercy-maya, altruism were reduced
 shahar main buraaiyaan bad gai thim
 Alcohol, gambling, race, adultery, robbery, robbery, etc
 were committed in many crimes in the city
 inke baavjood shahar main kuch achche log bhi rahete the
 Sheila and her husband were considered to be family members in such people
 shila dharmik prakruti kii or santoshi swabhaav vaali thi
 Her husband was also prudent and intelligent
 shila or uskaa pati kabhi kisi kii buraai nahin karte the or prabhu bhajan main acchhee tarah samay vyateet kar rahe the
 The people of the city appreciated his family
 dekhte hi dekhte samay badal gaya
 Sheela's husband became friends with bad people
 ab vah jald se jald karodpati banane ke khwab dekhne laga
 Therefore, he started on the wrong path and as a result he became Rodapati
 yani raste par bhatakate bhikhaari jaisi uski haalat ho gai thi
 Sheela's husband also got trapped in bad habits like alcohol, gambling, race, weed and marijuana
 doston ke saath use bhi sharaab kii aadat ho gai
 Thus he lost everything in race gambling
 shila ko pati ke bartaav se bahut dukh hua, kintu vah bhagwaan par bharosa kar sabakuch sahane lagi
 She started spending most of her time in piety
 achaanak ek din dopaher ko unke dwaar par kisi ne dastak di
 Sheela opened the door and saw that a manji was standing
 uske chehre par alokik tej nikhar rahaa tha
 As if nectar was flowing from his eyes
 uskaa bhavy cheharaa karunaa or pyaar se chhalak rahaa tha
 Sheela had a lot of peace on seeing her
 shila ke rome-rome main anand chaa gaya
 Sheela brought the man in the house with respect
 ghar main bithaane ke liye kuch bhi nahin tha
 So Sheela shrugged and placed him on a torn sheet
 maanji boleen- kyon shila! mujhe pahachaanaa nahin? har shuukravaar ko lakshmi ke mandir main bhajan-kirthan ke samay main bhi vahaan aati hoon
 'despite this, Sheila could not understand anything
 phir maanji boleen- 'tum bahut dinon se mandir nahin ain atah main tumhen dekhne chali ai
 ' maanji ke ati prembhre shabdon se shila kaa hriday pigal gaya
 Tears welled up in her eyes and she wept bitterly
 maanji ne kaha- 'beti! sukh or dukh to dhoop or chaanv jaise hote hai
 Be patient daughter! Tell me all your problems 'maanji ke vyavhaar se shila ko kaaphi sambal mila or sukh kii aas main usne maanji ko apni sari kahani kah sunai
 Hearing the story, Manji said- 'the pace of karma is unique
 har insaan ko apane karm bhugatne hi padate hai
 So don't worry
 ab tu karm bhugat chuki he
 Now your happy days will definitely come
 tu to maan lakshmi kii bhakt he
 Maa Lakshmiji is the embodiment of love and compassion
 ve apane bhakton par hameshaa mamata rakhti hai
 Therefore, keep patience and observe Maa Lakshmiji fast
 isse sab kuch thik ho jayega
 ' shila ke poochne par maanji ne use vrath kii sari vidhi bhi bataai
 Manji said- 'daughter! Maa Lakshmiji's fast is very simple
 use 'varadalakshmi vrath' yaa 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' kaha jaataa he
 All the wishes of this fast are fulfilled
 vah sukh-sampatti or yash praapt karata he
 ' shila yah sunakar aanandit ho gai
 When Sheela opened her eyes with determination, there was no one in front of her
 vah vismit ho gai ki maanji kahan gayi? shila ko tatkaal yah samajhate der na lagi ki maanji or koi nahin saakshaat lakshmi hi thim
 The second day was Friday
 sabere snaan karke svachh kapade pahanakar shila ne maanji dwaara bataai vidhi se puure man se vrath kiya
 Prasad was distributed in the last
 yah prasad pehle pati ko khilaayaa
 The nature of the husband changed as soon as Prasad was eaten
 us din usne shila ko maaraa nahin, sataaya bhi nahin
 Sheela was very happy
 unke man main 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' ke liye shraddha bad gai
 Sheela performed 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat' till twenty-one Friday with full devotion and devotion
 ikkisven shuukravaar ko maanji ke kahe mutabik udhyapan vidhi kar ke saat striyon ko 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' kii saat pustaken uphaar main deen
 Then, after worshiping the image of Mother's' Dhanalakshmi Swaroop ', she started praying in her heart with emotion -' o Mother Dhanalakshmi! i made a vow to do 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat', that fast is completed today
 he maan! meri har vipatti dur karo
 Welfare us all
 jise santan na ho, use santan dena
 Keeping the good luck of a lucky woman
 kunari ladki ko manabhaavan pati dena
 Whoever performs this miraculous Vaibhavalakshmi fast, remove all their miseries
 sabhi ko sukhi karnaa
 Hey mother! Your glory is immense
 ' aisa bolkar lakshmi ke 'dhanalakshmi swaroop' kii chhabi ko pranaam kiya
 With the effect of fasting, Sheela's husband became a good man and started working hard
 usne turant shila ke girvee rakhe gahane chhudaa liye
 There was a flood of money in the house
 ghar main pehle jaisi sukh-shanti chaa gai
 Seeing the effect of 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat', other women of the locality also started doing 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat' methodically
 vaibhavalakshmi vrath' udhyapan vidhisaat, gyaarah yaa ikkis, jitne bhi shuukravaaron kii mannath maangi ho, utane shuukravaar tak yah vrath puri shraddha tathaa bhaavana ke saath karnaa chahie
 On the last Friday, it should be done according to the classical method
 aakhri shuukravaar ko prasad ke liye kheer banani chahie
 The way we worship every Friday, we should do the same
 pujan ke baad maan ke saamne ek shriphal phoden phir kam se kam saat kunari kanyaon yaa saubhagyashaalee striyon ko kumkum kaa tilak lagaakar maan vaibhavalakshmi vrath katha kii pustak kii ek-ek prati uphaar main deni chahie or sabko kheer kaa prasad dena chahie
 After this, Goddess Lakshmiji should bow with reverence
 phir mataji ke 'dhanalakshmi swaroop' kii chhabi ko vandan karke bhav se man hi man prarthana karen- 'he maan dhanalakshmi! maine aapkaa 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' karne kii mannath maani thi, vah vrath aaj purna kiya he
 Hey mother! Complete our wish hamaari har vipatti dur karo
 Welfare us all
 jise santan na ho, use santan dena
 Keeping the good luck of a lucky woman
 kunari ladki ko manabhaavan pati dena
 Whoever performs this miraculous Vaibhavalakshmi fast, remove all their miseries
 sabhi ko sukhi karnaa
 Hey mother! Your glory is immense
 ' aapaki jai ho! aisa bolkar lakshmi ke 'dhanalakshmi swaroop' kii chhabi ko pranaam karen
