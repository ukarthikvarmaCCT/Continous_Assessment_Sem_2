 Poetry is the philosophy and science of poetry and literature
 yah kavyakritiyon ke vishleshan ke aadhaar par samay-samay par udbhavit siddhanton kii gyanrashi he
 The poetry and literature of literature and craft varies according to the prevailing circumstances; As a result, poetic principles have also been constantly changing
 bharat main bharat ke siddhanton se lekar aaj tak or pashchim main sucraat or uske shishy plato se lekar adhyatan "navalochana' tak ke siddhanton ke aitihaasik anushilan se yah baat saaf ho jaati he
 In India, poetic natakadi works are called 'lakshya Granth' and theoretical texts are called 'bhavishya Granth'
 ye lakshan granth sadaa lakshya granth ke pashchaadbhaavani tathaa anugami he or mahan kavi inaki li ko chunauti dete dekhe jate hai
 The old names for poetry are 'sahitya Shastra' and 'alankashastra' and after incorporating the wide creative volume of literature, it also came to be called 'samyastashastra'
 mulat: kavyashastreey chintan shabdakavy tathaa drishykavy ke hi sambandh main siddhant sthir karata dekha jaataa he
 Aristotle's "poetics" assesses the critical criterion of comedy, tragedy, and epic, and the Natyashastra of Bharata presents only the principles of review of metaphor or voyeurism
 bharat or pashchim main yah chintan i
pus
 teesri chauthi shatee se hi praudh rup main milane lagata he jo is baat kaa parichaayak he ki kavy ke vishay main vichaar vimarsh kai sadiyon pehle hi shuru ho chukaa tha
 Poetry is basically associated with the triple dimension - poetry, poetry, poetry
 jahaan tak natyarup kavy kaa sambandh he, kavyakarta ke saath usamen natya prayogkarta natadi kaa bhi samavesh ho jaataa he
 The attention of poetic thinkers has always been on all these aspects
 sabase pehla prashn jo kavi ke sambandh main uthta he, vah yah he ki kavi yaa kalakaar anya maanav, dharmopadeshak, darshanik, vaigyanik, raajnneetik vichaarak se kis baat main vishisht he or kyon khaas prakruti ke vyakti hi kavi yaa kalakaar ban pate hai? duusare shabdon main, kavitvsakti ke hetu kya he
 Socrates and Plato consider poetry to be a product of divine charge, not a reward for study and practice
 bharat ke kavyashastri kavyrachana main pratibha ko pradhan hetu maanate hue bhi iske saath vyutpatti or abhyaas ko bhi kam mahatv nahin dete
 Conservative critics do not consider talent only for poetic power
 udhar pashchim ke romentic vichaarak kalakriti kii mul prerana ekmaatr pratibha ko hi maanate hai
 Yet all the thinkers are unanimous that the poet is a uniquely talented person who through his talent originates new creation in the form of poetry
 doosraa mahatvapurn prashn he, kavita kaa prayojan kya he? akhir kavi kavita kyon karata he? is sambandh main chintakon ke do dal hai– paramparawaadi chintak kavy kaa lakshya yaa prayojan naitik upadesh kii pratishtha maanate hai
 Through poetry, the poet wants to establish some values, just like a religious preacher
 kintu fark yah he ki uski kriti shailicilp kii drushti se romantic or rasmay hone ke kaaran dharmagranthon yaa nitigranthon se vishisht ban jaati he
 The Romantic thinker does not accept this
 vah kavi ko upadeshak nahin maanata
 According to him, the poet is the creator, the creator, who is also distinct from Brahma
 vah apni sristi, apni kalakriti ke madhyam se hamaare saamne rakhata he
 In fact, he wants to express his feelings through poetry
 kavy or kuch nahin, uski samast anubhutiyon kaa sarabhat tatv or uske antas main umadte-ghumdate bhaavon kaa swat: baha hua pariwaah maatr he
 Nearly all the mismatches of East and West can be merged into these two camps
 kavy kaa sabase mahatvapurn paksh vah kriti he, jo hamaare samaksh chakshush, shravan tathaa bauddhik sannikarsh kaa madhyam banati he or is madhyam se vah hamaare man yaa sanvit ko prabhavit karti he
 Therefore, in poetic thinking, this is the main aspect whose thinkers of East and West have been crying over the last two and a half thousand years about many aspects
 sabase pehla sawaal jo kavy ke kathy ke vishay main uthta he, vah yah he ki kavy main varnit ghatnaayen aadi kahan tak vaigyanik satya se mail khaati hai
 It is generally accepted by all critics that poetry does not take the form of fact-telling system
 usamen jis satya kaa samudghaatan hota he, vah vaastavik satya na hokar sambhavya satya hota he
 On this basis, anti-poets declare the imagination of the poet as confusing or far from the truth
 plato ne to ise satya se duhara dur siddh kiya he
 The thinkers of India have not considered poetry to be an illusion, although at one place Bhatt Lollat has interpreted Rā मेंa Adi in the form of the Nats imitating Rāma etc
 in the play of the play, while interpreting the Rasasutra
 pashchim main idhar manovigyaan ke vikaas ke pariprekshya main kavyashastreey chintan ne bhrantivaale is paksh ko or adhik majboot kiya he
 It is said that art is just an illusion
 isi se miltaa julata ek or mat bhi he
 Art is nothing but hypnosis
 idhar nritatv vigyaan ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par bhi kavy kii sammohini shakti par jor diya jane laga he or yah mat prabal ho uthaa he ki kavy yaa kala main puraane aadim samaaj ke ojhaaon ke mantron kii tarah jaadui asar hota he 
 This question arises here, after all, whether this illusion, hypnosis or magical effect, if we want to borrow the words of the old scholars, the "miracle" of poetry is caused by what elements? Poetry is basically fixed in language
 bhashaa shabd or arth kaa sanshlisht rup he
 Hence, the first question that will arise is whether poetry is merely wordy or semantic
 hamaare yahan ye donon mat prachlit hai
 Thinkers like Bhamah, Kuntaka, Mammat consider the word and its combined element of meaning to be poetic, not just the word or only the meaning, because in poetry, the two cannot be separated from each other
 is mat ke anusaar kavy ko chamatkaarshali yaa sammohak banane ke liye shabd or arth donon kii romaniyata par kavi ko samaan bal dena hoga
 The second view places more emphasis on the word in the influence of poetry, that is, on the auditory side than on its intellectual side
 prasiddh sanskrit kavi panditraj jagannatha kaa yahi mat he
 This view seems to be of those who emphasize more on the rhythm of poetry, vocabulary, verses and Shravan Bimbavatta
 pashchim ke svachhndathawadi sameekshak, visheshat: france ke pratikwaadi kavi or aalochak, saaf kehete hai ki kavy arth yaa vichaar se nahin banataa balki shabdon se banataa he 
 If we compare this opinion with the meaningless Shabarajal mantras of the exorcists, then we will find that here also the meaning is not important, but the rhythm of the words, the tone of the chanting of the exorcist Ojha is said to influence the patient and do psychotherapy
 yahi paddati manovishleshnatmak upachaar kii bhi he
 Word and meaning have been considered of special importance in creating the effect of poetry, so it becomes imperative to consider the relation of word and meaning in poetic thinking
 shabd kaa apane paramparaagat arth se niyat sambandh hota he
 This relationship has been called Abhidha Vyapaar here
 kintu bhashaa main is vyapaar ke atirikt anya vyapaar bhi kaary karata dekha jaataa he, jahaan shabd apane niyat arth ko chhodkar usase sambhddha kisi duusare arth kii pratiti bhi kara saktaa he, jise lakshana vyapaar kehete hai
 Aristotle has also discussed both these trades of language in his famous treatise "rhetorics"
 kavyabhasha main vastut: shabd abhidhaparak na hokar lakshanik hote hai
 There is a greater emphasis on this matter here in the West and it was started by the romanticist poet and thinker Coleridge
 uske anusaar samast kavyabhasha lakshanik he
 Other modern poets like IA Richards, Empson etc
 have also accepted this view
 is mat ke anusaar kavy main upatt bimb, roopak, pratik or myth sabhi bhashaa kii lakshanik prakriyaayein hai or itnaa hi nahin, kavy kaa chandovidhan, lay or shabdashayya kaa prayojan bhi sarvatha lakshanik he
 Similar to this view we have here of the soundist poeticist who in euphemism, goes a step ahead of the symptom and envisages euphemism and considers all the elements of poetry as expressions of feeling or as a satire
 udhar vakroktivaadee kuntak bhi kavy main upatt shabd or arth ke vyapaar ko saadhaaran abhidha na maanakar vichitramidha yaa vakrokti kehete hai or is vakrokti kaa viniyog varna, pad, vaakya, arthprakaran, prabandh jaise kavyangon main nirdisht karte hai
 The basic foundation of this division of Kuntaka rests on the formalist theory of Vamana
 yah kavy kii sanghatana yaa sanrachana kaa vishleshan kar uske un angon ke sammohak tatv ko samudghaatit karti he jo kavy sunne yaa padhanevaale ko prabhavit karte hai
 This analysis is associated with grammar and philology on the one hand and on the other hand, with artistic thinking
 idhar america main jo sanrachnawadi paddati kii nai kavyasamiksha chal padi he, vah usee drushtikon ko lekar chali jiskaa sutarapaat sanskrit kaavyon ke vivechan ke sambandh main hamaare yahan apane-apane dhang se vaaman, aanandavardhan or kuntak kar chuke hai
 Given the extent of the essay, it is not possible to discuss all the ideas from time to time on different parts of poetry
 kavy ke mulat: do paksh hai
 One is the Katyapaksha, which we find in the particular type of content of the content and the inner sensation of artistic feeling or rasadi expressed from it
 doosraa he kavy kaa shailipaksh jisamen lay, chand, shabdachayan, gun or alankaar kii yojana kaa vivechan hota he
 These elements have been discussed in detail by thinkers of East and West
 kintu yahan itnaa samajha lenaa hoga ki kavy kii prabhavanviti samgr hoti he
 All these elements in their own way are seen to contribute to that overall effectiveness
 hamaare yahan alankaarawaadi or ritivaadee sameekshak is samgr prabhavanvitivaale mat ko nahin maanate
 They consider the beauty or miracle of poetry in the meaning of ornamentation or in specific designation
 kintu vakroktivaadee or dhvanivaadee prabhaav kii drushti se kavy kii samagrata ko lekar chalate hai, bhale hi vishleshan kii drushti se ve bhi uske tattat ansh kii mimasaa karte hon
 Traditional critics in the West similarly do not judge the totality of poetry in terms of influence, and in poetry it is seen to give importance to ornamentation, utterance, far-sighted imagination
 vahaan bhi isa kii duusari shatee main ek aisa chintak hua he jisane kavy kii is samagrata ke siddhant ko pratishthapit kiya tha
 This is the core of Longinus's sublime theory
 pashchim ke romentic kavi or aalochak bhi kavy kaa chamatkaar samagrata main hi maanate hai or kuch aisi hi dharna hindi ke chhayavaadi or chhayavadottar aalochakon kii he
 The various poetic theories like ornament, ritual, curvature, rasa, sound, justification, miracle that we had, are basically based on what part of the beauty of poetry
 inkaa vishesh vivechan yahan anaavashyak hoga
 The third element after the poet and the poet is the listener or reader of the poem and the spectator of the play which is called Sahridaya in the words of the soundist
 sahruday kaa arth he samaan hridayvaala vah vyakti jo kavyanushilan ke samay usamen tanmayeebhoot hokar kavi ke samaan hridayvaala ban jaae
 This similarity of his heart is also related to the specific character or heroine mentioned in the poem
 is samanhridayata ko sthapit karne ke liye bhatnayak ne saadhaaraneekaran vyapaar kii kalpana kii thi jise abhinavgupt ne bhi maan liya he
 According to these Raswadis of India, in the mind of Kavyanushilaka, the raga disguise form Raja and all the qualities of the child, and the liberation of truth causes the mind to experience relaxation
 abhinavgupt is sthiti ko yogiyon kii samadhisthiti ke samaan maanate hai
 No theory has emerged in the West to regard the soul of poetry as an element like rasa, but in the last century there has been a theory developed by the rise of Romanticism that the listener or reader of poetry has empathy or sympathy with the poet or poetical character
 Experiences, as we have with Shakespeare's Hamlet or Macbeth, and with the style's prominence
 apane yahan, rasadasha tak ham kaise pahonchte hai, iskaa apane dhang se manovaigyanik vishleshan abhinavgupt ke yahan miltaa he
 But it is just a structure
 abhi haal main hue manovigyaangat shodhon ke kaaran is paksh par adhik prakaash padaa he
 a special branch of psychology, in which physiology is studied by our neoplasms and how the hearing, visual, sparsion, olfactory and nasal images, or their imagination, affects our brain and how it stimulates our psyche It happens, discoveries have been made and are happening that affect the how, why and how of poetry and artwork on the poetic Is busy in its deliberations
 uparyukt vivechan se spasht hoga ki aaj kavyashastreey chintan kaa kshetra kitna vistrut ho gaya he
 On the one hand he touches the ends of grammar, philology, art, philosophy and rhetoric, on the other hand he is also associated with psychology and physiology

 jab sapind log snaan karne ke liye jal main pravesh karne ko udyat hote hai or jab ve mrit ko jal dena chaahate hai to apane sambandhiyon yaa saale se jal ke liye is prakaar prarthana karte hai-'ham log udakkriya karnaa chaahate hai', is par doosraa kahata he-'aisa karo kintu pun: na aana

 In addition to the six vedangas, indexes are also included under the Sanskrit literature
 aisi anukramaniyan anek hai
 These include the gross suktas of the Vedic codes, the verses used in them, the seer Rishi of each mantra, the verses of each richa and the deity ordinarily scheduled
 sankalit vishay ke anusaar inaki pruthak pruthak sangyaayen hai- jaise In the same way there is Mandalantanukram and Devanukram
 is prakaar kisi bhi vaidic mantra kaa rishi, chand yaa devtaa koun he athwa vah mantra kis mandal, anuwak yaa sookt kaa he, yah jaanane ke liye tatsambandhi anukramani kaa avlokan sahaayak hota he
 In fact, the above mentioned indexes were not only helpful in the research as in the dictionary, but their aim is the unique form of Sukta and Anuwak and the unique means of not allowing the recitation of mantras
 phir bhi kisi bhi ek mantra ke sambandh main uske chand, devtaa aadi ke gyaan ke liye anek anukramaniyan dekhni padati thim, kyonki tatsambandhi sakal gyatavya vishay ek jagah uplabdh na tha
 With a view to removing this difficulty, Maharishi Katyayan created a sequence in which the gross achievement of the total known item in respect of all the mantras under the Code
 isamen prayek mantra kaa chand, devtaa, rishi, mandal, sookt, evam anuwaad kaa vivaran purna rup se ek hi sthaan par diya hua miltaa he
 He named it Sarvanukramanari
 katyayan pranit sarvanukramani kii sangya kaa nirvachan kiya he- sarvaggeyarth varnanaat sarvanukramnishbdan nirbuvanti vipaschit:
 Katyayana created the Shakla and Vashkal Samhita of the Rigveda, and the Vajasaneyi Samhita of the Shukla Yajurveda
 katyayan pranit sarvanukramani par "vedarthdipika" naamak ek sundar vyakhya shadgurushishy dwaara rachi gai jo atyant pramanik maani jaati he
 Other indexes published by Shaunak regarding the subject are worded; Both of the Katyayan transitions are proselytizing and are fixed in the prose formulaic style

 There is a large book written in the Sarvanukramani Sutra style of the Rigveda

 Its first 12 chapters have introductory discussion, out of which 9 chapters have introductory essays on the form and composition of Vedic verses
 sarvanukramani ke praneta katyayan ne grantharambh main "yathopadesh main rugveda kii richaon ke pratik aadi kii anukramani prastut karata hoon" aisi pratigya kii he
 It is an indication from the context that this work has been done on the basis of various verses in the erstwhile shaunakparnit
 kyonki sarvanukramani main katipay gadyansh vruttagandhi hai ore shaunakeey arshanukramani or brihaddevataa main prayukt katipay pad swarupatah parigrihit hai
 Katyayan Praneeth Rigveda's Sarvanukramrani has been edited by Acharya Macdonal, published from Oxford in 1886 AD

 Drips irrigation or 'drip irrigation', is a special method of irrigation in which water and manure are saved
 is vidhi main pani ko paudhon kii jadon par buund-boond karke tapakaaya jaataa he
 For this purpose a network of valves, pipes, tubes and emitters have to be installed
 ise 'tapak sinchai' yaa 'buund-buund sinchai' bhi kehete hai
 Drip or droplet irrigation is an irrigation method in which water is transported to the roots of plants directly by plastic drains at short intervals
 paramparaagat satahi sinchai dwaara jal kaa uchit upyog nahin ho paata, kyonki adhiktar pani, joki paudhon ko milanaa chahie, jameen main ris kar yaa vashpikaran dwaara vyarth chalaa jaataa he
 Therefore, in order to make the right and full use of available water, an irrigation system is necessary through which water leakage is minimized and maximum water is available to the plant
 kam dabaav or niyantran ke saath sidhe fasalon kii jad main unki aavashyaktaanusaar pani dena hi tapak sinchai he
 The process of supplying fertilizer to plants through drip irrigation is called fertilization, which provides proper crop nutrition at the right time by curbing nutrient leaching and evaporation losses

 sabmen jameen ke andar kam se kam dedh se do feet kii gaharaai par rakhte hai
 The control valve at the beginning of the submen and the frush valve at the end are connected to control the pressure and flow rate speed
 pani kaa pravaah or daab niyantrit karne ke liye sabmen ke aage volve lagaaye jate hai
 It is necessary to install air release and vacuum release valves at the beginning of submen

 Beta cells of Langerhans' islets in type 1 diabetes are destroyed by an automated resistance process, so researchers and clinicians are actively looking for ways to restore physiologic beta cell activity through islet transplantation
 So that patients with type 1 diabetes get relief

 America's independence war brought a new twist in the history of European colonialism
 usne africa, asia evam latin america ke rajyon kii bhavi swatantraaa ke liye ek paddati taiyaar kar di
 Thus, the result of the war of America was not only that the 13 colonies separated from the mother country, but that the colonies became a laboratory of new political ideas and institutions in a way

 The struggle for liberation of the American colonies from the suzerainty of England was different from other conflicts in history
 yah sangharsh na to garibi se utpann asantosh kaa parinaam tha or na yahaan ki janata samantvaadi vyavastha se peedit thi
 The American colonies fought against the harsh colonial policy of the Government of England to maintain their independence and independence in practice
 america kaa swatantraaa sangram vishwa itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana he
 a fierce naval war took place between England and Spain in 1588 AD, in which Spain was defeated and with this established British naval superiority and England established its colonial settlements in America
 1775 i

 These American colonies can be divided geographically into three parts- in upniveshon main 90% angeraj or 10t% dach, german, francisi, portugali aadi the
 In this way, the American colony was part of both the Western world and the New World

 In a way, mixed culture was born here because people from different regions had different means of their own customs, religious beliefs, governance, organization and living
 in bhinnataaon ke baavjood unamem ekta thi or yah ekta ek samaan samasyaon ke kaaran tathaa uske samaadhaan ke prayaas ke falswaroop paidaa hui thi
 Not only this but also the rapid arrival of people from the West and because of this, the spirit of building a democratic society was also spread

 In other words, it can be said that the American Revolution was the result of multiple economic, political, social and religious powers simultaneously
 america main aakar basane vaale apravasi england ke nagarikon ke apeksha kahin adhik swatantry permi the
 The reason for this was that the society here was far more egalitarian than in Europe
 america samaaj kii khaas visheshta thi-samantvaad evam atoot varg simaaon kii anupasthiti
 The upper class in American society had less political and economic power than in British society
 vastutah america main adhikansh kisaanon ke paas jameen thi jabaki britain main seemaant kaashtkaaron evam bhoomihin khetihar mazdooron kii sankhya zyada thi
 Immigrants began to work according to British law and the constitution, as they set foot on the new continent
 unki apni raajnneeti sansthaaen thi
 Thus there was a system of self-government in the American colonies from the very beginning, which developed over time
 aupniveshik shashan ko niyantrit karne ke liye british sarkaar governor kii niyukti karti thi or sahaayta dene ke liye ek kaaryakarini samiti hoti thi jiske sadasyon kaa manonayan british taj dwaara kiya jaataa tha
 In addition to assisting in the work of governance there was a legislative house / assembly consisting of representatives elected by the public
 is vidhayak sadan ko kar lagane, adhikariyon kaa vetan tay karne, kanoon nirmaan karne kaa adhikaar tha
 But the governor had full authority to accept or repeal the laws
 is vyavastha se upniveshon kii janata main asantosh upja
 England did not try to curb the independence and self-government of the colonies at the outset because there was a continuous struggle between the monarchy and Parliament in the nearly 85 years from the early 17th century to the "bloodless revolution" in England
 phir jab sarkaar ne vibhinn karon ko lagaakar unhen sakhti se vasuulne kaa prayaas kiya to upniveshon main asantosh panpa or yahi asantosh kranti main badal gaya
 French colonies were spread across North America from Quebec to the Mississippi Valley

 As a result, between 1756-63, there was a seven-year war between the two and England was victorious in this and the British colonies in Canada became British
 is yuddh ke parinamswaroop america main uttar se francisi khatra khatm ho gaya
 Hence the dependence of the colonists on England was ended
 ab unhen britain ke viruddh vidroh karne kaa avasar mil gaya
 The second effect was that England took control of the vast area in North America from the Mississippi River to the Alagani ranges
 faltah america basti ke nivasee apni simaaen ab pashchimi kii ore badhanaa chaahate the or is kshetra main rahane vaale mul nivaaseen red indians ko khaded dena chaahate the
 As a result there was conflict
 atah england kii sarkaar ne 1763 main ek shahi ghoshnaa dwaara florida, mississippi aadi pashchimi ke kshetra red indian ke liye surakshit kar diya
 This halted the spread of the colonists to the west and they considered the government of England as their enemy
 iske atirikt saptavarshiya yuddh ke dauraan england ko bahut adhik dhanrashi kharch kerani padi jiske kaaran england ko aarthik samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 British politicians believed that England had spent money to protect the colonies, so the colonies should pay more taxes to England
 yahi vajah he ki pehle se lagu jahajrani kanoon, vyapaarik kanoon, sugar act aadi kadai se lagu kiye gaye
 But the colonists were not ready to pay for that situation
 is prakaar saptavarshiya yuddh ne america swatantraaa sangram ke sutarapaat main mahati bhoomika nibhaai
 The economic exploitation of the colonies by England was the main cause of discontent between the colonies and the homeland
 prachlit vaanijyavaadee siddhanth ke anusaar england upniveshon ke vyapaar par niyantran rakhana chahta tha or unke bazaaron par ekadhikaar rakhana chahta tha
 The system of colonies was based on the principle that "colonies are for the benefit of England"
 england ne apane laabh ko drushtigat rakhte hue kanoon banaae- Navigation law: According to the provision of 1651 AD, trade in the colonies could be done only through ships from England, Ireland or colonies
 iske tahat yah vyavastha kii gai ki england ke liye aavashyak sabhi prakaar ke kachche maal bina england ke bandargahon par laae, upniveshon se duusare sthanon par niryaat nahin kiye jaae
 This benefited England's shipping industry as well as the merchants of England
 Under the law of 1663 it was said that goods exported from Europe to the American colonies would first be brought to the ports of England
 is kanoon se england ke vyapaariyon tathaa vyapaaree bedo ke maalikon ko america upabhokta kii keemat par laabh hota tha
 These laws were unjust to the colonists
 vyapaarik adhinium : england ne kanoon banaaya ki america main utpaadit vastuon jaise chaaval, loha, lakdi, tambaakoo aadi kaa niryaat keval england ko hi kiya ja saktaa tha
 These rules created great fury in the colonies
 kyonki france evam dach vyapaaree unhen in vastuon ke liye angerajon se adhik mulya dene ko taiyaar the
 Industrial Act: England enacted the law that the industrial goods which were produced in England could not be manufactured by its American colonies
 is prakaar 1689 ke kanoon dwaara upniveshon se oonee maal tathaa 1732 i

 Although the above laws were detrimental to the colonies, the colonies did not oppose them as they were not strictly enforced
 aage jorge tritiy ke kaal main jab inhen sakhti se lagu kiya gaya to upniveshon ne inkaa virodh kiya
 Education and journalism developed along with the stability of life in America which contributed to the development of intellectual consciousness
 america ke anek bauddhik chintakon jaise-benjamin franklin, thomas jeffrasan, james wilson, jon adams, thomas pen, james otis, samual adams aadi ne matrudesh ke prati upniveshon ke pratirodh kaa auchity bataaya
 His ideas were influenced by thinkers like John Locke, Montescue
 lekin ye vichaar aise shashakt rup se abhivyakt kiye gaye the ki use america logon kii swashaasan kii maang ko bal mila gaya
 Britain tried to raise local taxes by implementing several types of tax laws in the American colony
 isse bhi upnivesh main ghor asantosh kii bhaavana badi
 a constitutional issue also arose here
 british kaa maananaa tha ki british sansad sarvocch shakti he or vah apane america upnivesh ke maamle main kisi prakaar kaa kanoon paarit kar sakati he
 Whereas, the American colonies believed that the right to tax them lies only in the assemblies of the colonies and not in the British Parliament because they lack representation
 laud north kii chaay niti-1773 i
 main east india company ko vittiya sankat se ubaarane ke liye britain ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri lord north ne yah kanoon banaaya ki company sidhe hi america main chaay bech sakati he
 As before, the company's ships were not required to arrive and pay taxes on the ports of England
 is kadam kaa lakshya tha company ko ghate se bachaana tathaa america logon ko chaay uplabdh karana
 But the people of the American colony were unhappy with this monopoly of the company because such a rule was made without the consent of the colonies
 atah upnivesh main is chaay niti kaa jamkar virodh hua or kaha gaya ki “sasti chaay” ke madhyam se england bahari kar lagane ke apane adhikaar ko banaae rakhana chahta tha
 Hence, agitation started against the tea scheme in the whole country
 16 disambar 73 ko samual adams ke netritv main boston bandargah par east india company ke jahaaj main bhari hui chaay kii petiyon ko samudr main phenk diya gaya
 In American history, this event is called the Boston Tea Party
 is ghatana main british sansad ke saamne ek kadi chunauti utpann kii
 Therefore, the British government enacted harsh and oppressive laws to punish the American colonists
 boston bandargah ko band kar diya gaya
 The government of Massachusetts was reorganized and the power of the governor was increased and soldiers were made to live in the city and murder cases were transferred from American courts to England and other colonies
 britain jise ek ajey raashtra mana jaataa tha
 His defeat at the hands of the American colonies was astonishing

 Nevertheless, America triumphed

 england dwaara nae upniveshon kii sthapana : 13 america upniveshon ke swatantra ho jane se england ke aupniveshik samrajya ko thes pahunchi
 To regain their lost prestige and secure business interests, colonization was attempted in new territories and it was in this context that British colonies were established in Australia and New Zealand
 3
 england kii aupniveshik niti main parivartan : america upnivesh ke haath se nikal jane se british sarkaar ne yah anubhav kar liya yadi shesh bache hue upniveshon ko apane adheen rakhana he to use aupniveshik shoshan kii niti ko chhodana or or upniveshon kii janata ke adhikaron evam maangon kaa sammaan karnaa hoga
 On the basis of this changed policy, in the 19th and 20th centuries, the British Government established the British Commonwealth of Nations, ie the British Commonwealth

 england dwaara vaanijyavaadee siddhanth kaa parityag : upniveshon ke chhin jane ke baad bahut se logon kaa yah maananaa tha ki isse england ke vyapaar vaanijya ko jabardast dhakka lagegaa
 But after a few years more trade started in England and the United States than ever before, most of the countries lost faith in the "principle of commerce"
 swayan england ne bhi is niti kaa parityag kar diya or mukt vyapaar kii niti ko apanaaya
 In fact, the main principles of the French Revolution can be seen in the Native American struggle for freedom, equality and fraternity
 america kranti kaa prabhaav ireland evam kuch anshon main bharat par bhi padaa
 At that time, the people of Ireland were also fighting for their freedom against England
 america kranti ne unhen swatantra rup se perarna pradaan kii
 The American slogan, No Tax or No Representation, became extremely popular in Ireland, as a result, in 1782, the British government gave the Parliament of Ireland the right to legislate
 bharat par america kranti kaa prabhaav pratikul rup se padaa
 During the period of the American War of Independence, the anglo-french War in India also arose due to France entering the war
 jisase laabh uthaakar angrejon ne francisiyon kii shakti kshati pahunchaakar apane samrajya vistaar ke maarg ko sulabh bana liya
 In another way, the impact of the American Revolution can be seen on India
 vastutah america kranti ke anek kaarnon main ek kaaran yahi bhi tha ki british ne america upniveshon ke shashan main prabhavi hastkshep nahin kiya tha
 As a result, the American colonists developed a system of independent consciousness and self-government
 jab british ne vahaan hastkshep kiya to asantosh upja
 Therefore, Britain learned from this situation and continued active intervention in the internal affairs of the Indian colony from the earliest stage and limited the freedom of its inhabitants
 sahaayak sandhi evam vilay kii niti ke madhyam se bharat ke aantarik maamalon main british hastkshep kiya gaya evam foot daalon tathaa shashan karo kii niti apanaakar bhartiya virgon ko alag-alag rakhaa gaya
 In this way, learning from the American conditions, conditions were created in India that divided the people and kept the British Empire's hold on the colonial empire
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki america swatantraaa yuddh ne britain ko ek samrajya se to vanchit kar diya lekin ek-duusare samrajya kii neenv ko majboot kar diya
 The American freedom struggle can be seen divided into two phases - the first phase was the period of 1762-72, the period of revolutionary movement and during this period, the voice against colonial exploitation was raised and internal reforms were emphasized within the British Empire itself
 kintu jab yah prayaas vifal ho gaya tab 1772 ke pashchaat doosraa charan aarambh hota he jo swatantraaa-sangram kaa charan rahaa
 At this stage, American leaders not only challenged the right to tax, but declared that the British Empire itself was the main problem and the only way out of it
 is prakaar america swatantraaa sangram kii prakriya kranti se shuru hui or jisaki parinti swadhinata sangram ke rup main hui
 It is called a revolution because in the context of entire modern world history, radical changes were brought about on political, social and ideological aspects
 america madhyavarg atyant udaar, pragatisheel evam jaagruk tha
 This class raised its voice against the privileges of the colonial rulers and led the revolution
 samual adams, banzmin franklin, james otis jaise netaa madhyavarg kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 In this revolution fought on ideological basis, middle class issues took prominence
 jaise-pratinidhitiv nahin to kar nahin, matadhikaar kii maang, swadhinata kii maang aadi
 The middle class was the main signer of the Declaration of Independence
 america-kranti main vargeey sangharsh kaa put bhi vidyaman tha jisamen ek ore england kaa kuleen shaasha varg tha jiske samarthan main america dhani evam kuleen varg the jo prajatantr ke aagaman evam uski pratikriyaaon se bhaybheet tha
 On the other hand, there were American artisans, craftsmen, laborers, middle class people who were in favor of the American freedom struggle
 kranti pragatisheel swaroop ko liye hue thi, jisaki abhivyakti uski shashan pranali or samvidhan main dekhi ja sakati he
 In which the emphasis was on republicanism, constitutionalism, secularism, establishment of democratic values
 kranti ne aupniveshik siddhanton par chot kii or swatantra raashtra ke nirmaan ko protsaahan diya
 Women also participated heavily in the American Revolution
 guptchar ke rup main kaary kiya, shastr nirmaan se sahyog diya
 Seeing the participation of women in the revolution, Cornwallis said - Even if we eliminate all the men of North America, we will have to fight a lot to win the women
 uttar vaidic kaal se pehle kaa vah kaal jisamen rugveda kii richaon kii rachana hui thi in richaon kii jo bhashaa thi wo rigvaidic bhashaa kehalaati he
 The Rigvedic language is a language of the indo-european language family
 isaki parvarti putree bhashaayen avesta puraani farsi pali praakrit or sanskrit hain
 The native mother tongue of the Rigvedic language was the indo-iranian Aryans
 jaise homeric greek clasical greek se bhinn he vaisai rigvaidic bhashasanskrit bhashaa se bhinn he
 Tiwari suggested the difference between the two as follows: 19veen shatabdi main avastai farsi or rigvaidic bhashaa donon par pashchimi vidwaanon kii nazar nai-nai padi thi or in donon ke gahare sambandh kaa tathy unke saamne jaldi hi aa gaya
 He saw that the words of Avastai Persian and Rigvedic language could be translated from one to the other with some simple rules and both were very close in terms of grammar

 Their role is so important that they either initiate the chemical reactions of the body or increase their speed
 inkaa utpreran kaa gun ek chakree prakriya he
 Like all catalysts, fermentation also acts to reduce the catalytic energy of the reaction, resulting in an increase in the reaction speed
 adhikansh prakinwan abhikriyaayein anya gaiyr-utprerit abhikriyaaon kii tulana main lakhon guna tej gati se hoti hai
 Similarly, like all other catalytic reactions, fermentation does not consume in the reaction, nor does the reaction change the equilibrium

 There are generally three types of reactions with substrates
 sabstrate kaa anukulan tab hota he, jab prakinv sabstrate anuon ke saath kriya kar unke saath rasinic sambandh banaate hai
 In this, the fermentation reacts with the substrate and breaks down its molecules
 sabstrate ke saath kriya kar enzim usamen rasinic parivartan karata he or anuon ke electron kii sthiti main parivartan kar detaa he
 Due to this, the molecules are able to form relationships with the remaining molecules
 prakinv jab sabstrate ke sampark main aate hai to un par gadde ban jate hai
 Substrates react chemically with these pits and come into chemical form when exposed to fermentation
 is kriya ke puure hone par ve us utpaada ko mukt kar dete hai or duusare sabstrate ke saath kriya ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 In this way, the fermentation is never destroyed, but they are frequently involved in the cyclic process

 As a result of the October Revolution, the Provisional Government was replaced by a temporary government
 1917 kii roosi kranti beesvin sadi ke vishwa itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana rahi
 France's state revolution in 1789 AD affected Europe's life on a deeper level by propagating the spirit of freedom, equality and brotherhood

 She was distraught with hunger and clothes

 Bread shops were piled with fresh and hot rotis

 They started looting in the market
 sarkaar ne sena ko un par goli chalaane kaa aadesh diya ki vah goli chalaakar luutmaar karne waalon ko teetar-bitar kar de, kintu sainikon ne goli chalaane se saaf manaa kar diya kyonki unako janata se sahanubhuti thi
 The spirit of revolution had entered them as well
 jab mazdooron ne yah dekha ki sainik un par goli chalaane ko taiyaar nahin hai, to unka saahas bahut bad gaya
 Hence, the revolution had become inevitable now
