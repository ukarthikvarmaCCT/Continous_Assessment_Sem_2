 With his talent and dedication, he not only made amazing innovations in the field of Mathematics but also gave India an incomparable pride
 ye bachapan se hi vilakshan pratibhavan the
 He learned mathematics by himself and compiled 3,884 theorems of mathematics throughout his life
 inamen se adhikansh prameya sahi siddh kiye ja chuke hai
 He drew many fundamental and unconventional results on the strength of the intuitive knowledge of mathematics and the unique talent of algebraic hypothesis, which inspired research to date, although some of his discoveries have not yet been adopted into the mathematics mainstream
 haal main inke sutron ko crystal-vigyaan main prayukt kiya gaya he
 Ramanujan Journal has been established for the work being done in the areas of mathematics affected by his work
 ramanujan kaa janm 22 disambar1887 ko bharat ke dakshini bhubhag main sthit coimbatore ke erod naamake gaanv main hua tha
 He was born in a traditional Brahmin family
 inaki kii mata kaa naam komaltammal or inke pita kaa naam shrinivas ayyangar tha
 His childhood was spent mainly in Kumbakonam, which is known for its ancient temples
 bachapan main ramanujan kaa bauddhik vikaas saamaanya baalkon jaisaa nahin tha
 He did not even learn to speak until he was three years old
 jab itani badi aayu tak jab ramanujan ne bolnaa aarambh nahin kiya to sabko chintaa hui ki kahin yah gunge to nahin hai
 In later years, when he entered school, he never felt in traditional education
 ramanujan ne das varshon kii aayu main primary pariksha main puure jile main sabase adhik ank praapt kiya or aage kii shiksha ke liye toun hiskool pahunche
 Ramanujan loved asking questions
 unke prashn adhyapakon ko kabhi-kabhi bahut atapate lagate the
 Like - who was the first man in the world? What is the distance between earth and clouds? Ramanujan's behavior was very sweet
 inkaa saamaanya se kuch adhik sthool sharir or jigyaasa se chamakati aakhen inhen ek alag hi pahchaan detii thim
 According to their classmates, their behavior was so gentle that no one could get angry with them
 vidhyalay main inaki pratibha ne duusare vidhyaarthiyon or shikshakon par chhap chhodana aarambh kar diya
 He had studied college level mathematics during his school time
 ek baar inke vidhyalay ke pradhanadhyaapak ne yah bhi kaha tha ki vidhyalay main hone vaali parikshaon ke maapdand ramanujan ke liye lagu nahin hote hai
 After passing the high school examination, he received a Subramanian scholarship for scoring good marks in Mathematics and English and also got admission for further college education
 aage ek pareshaani ai
 Ramanujan's love for mathematics had grown so much that he did not pay attention to other subjects
 yahaan tak kii ve itihaas, jeev vigyaan kii kakshaon main bhi ganit ke prashnon ko hal kiya karte the
 As a result, in the eleventh grade examination, he failed in all subjects except mathematics and as a result he stopped getting scholarship
 ek to ghar kii aarthik sthiti kharaab or upar se chaatravrutti bhi nahin mil rahi thi
 This was a very difficult time for Ramanujan
 ghar kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye inhone ganit ke kuch tution tathaa khate-bahi kaa kaam bhi kiya
 Sometime later in 1907 Ramanujan again took the private examination of class XII and failed
 or isi ke saath inke paaramparik shiksha kii itishree ho gai
 The five years after leaving school were very frustrating for him
 bharat is samay paratantraa kii bediyon main jakadaaa tha
 There was severe poverty everywhere
 aise samay main ramanujan ke paas na koi naukari thi or na hi kisi santhaan athwa professor ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka
 His unwavering faith in God and deep reverence for mathematics always inspired him to follow the path of duty
 namgiri devi ramanujan ke parivaar kii isht devi thim
 Unwavering faith in him did not let him stay anywhere and he continued to conduct his research of mathematics even under such adverse circumstances
 is samay ramanujan ko tution se kul paanch rupaye masik milte the or isi main guzaara hota tha
 This life span of Ramanujan was full of grief and sorrow
 inhen hameshaa apane bharan-poshan ke liye or apni shiksha ko jari rakhane ke liye idhar udhar bhatakana padaa or anek logon se asafal yachana bhi kerani padi
 In the year 1908, his parents married him to a girl named Janaki
 vivaah ho jane ke baad ab inke liye sab kuch bhul kar ganit main doobana sambhav nahin tha
 Hence, he came to Madras in search of a job
 barahavin kii pariksha uteern na hone kii vajah se inhen naukari nahin mili or unka swasthya bhi buree tarah gir gaya
 Now on the advice of the doctor, he had to return to his home in Kumbakonam
 beemaari se thik hone ke baad ve waapas madras aae or phir se naukari kii talash shuru kar di
 Whenever he met someone, he used to show him a register of his own
 is register main inke dwaara ganit main kiye gaye saare kaary hote the
 At the same time, at the behest of someone, Ramanujan met Mr
 V
 Ramaswamy Iyer, the deputy collector there
 ayyar ganit ke bahut bade vidwaan the
 Here, Mr
 Iyer recognized the talent of Ramanujan and after asking District Magistrate Mr
 Ramchandra Rao, he also arranged a monthly scholarship of Rs
 25 for him
 is vritti par ramanujan ne madras main ek saal rahete hue apana pratham shodhpatr prakashit kiya
 The title of the research paper was "some properties of Bernoulli numbers" and this research paper was published in Journal of Indian Mathematical Society
 yahaan ek saal puraa hone par inhone madras port trust main clerk kii naukari kii
 Fortunately, there was not much work load in this job and here they used to get enough time for their mathematics
 yahaan par ramanujan raat bhar jaag kar nae-nae ganit ke sutara likhaa karte the or phir thodi der tak aaraam kar ke phir daftar ke liye nikal jate the
 Ramanujan used to write mathematics research on slate
 or baad main use ek register main likh lete the
 At night the sleep of other members of the family was disturbed due to the sound of Ramanujan's slate and pillar
 is samay bhartiya or pashchimi rahan sahan main ek badi duuri thi or is vajah se saamanytah bharatiyon ko angrej vaigyanikon ke saamne apane baton ko prastut karne main kaaphi sankoch hota tha
 The situation here was such that research work could not be carried forward without the help of an English mathematician
 is samay ramanujan ke puraane shubhachintak inke kaam aae or in logon ne ramanujan dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon ko landan ke prasiddh ganitagyon ke paas bheja
 But here they did not get any special help but one benefit was that people had come to know Ramanujan a little bit
 isi samay ramanujan ne apane sankhya siddhant ke kuch sutara professor sheshu ayyar ko dikhaae to unka dhyaan landan ke hi professor hardi kii taraf gaya
 Professor Hardy was one of the world's famous mathematicians of the time
 or apane sakht swabhaav or anushaasan priyata ke kaaran jane jate the
 After reading Professor Hardy's research work, Ramanujan said that he has found the answer to the unanswered question of Professor Hardy
 ab ramanujan kaa professor hardi se patravyavhaar aarambh hua
 From here on, a new era in Ramanujan's life began in which Professor Hardy had a very big role
 duusare shabdon main kaha jaae to jis tarah se ek johari heere kii pahchaan karata he or use taraash kar chamakaa detaa he, ramanujan ke jivan main vaisaa hi kuch sthaan professor hardi kaa he
 Professor Hardy was an admirer of Ramanujan's life and philosophy of life
 ramanujan or professor hardi kii yah mitrataa dono hi ke liye laabhprad siddh hui
 In a way, both of them worked complementary to each other
 professor hardi ne us samay ke vibhinn pratibhashali vyaktiyon ko 100 ke paimaane par aanka tha
 He gave 35 marks to most mathematicians and 60 marks to some specific persons
 lekin unhone ramanujan ko 100 main puure 100 ank die the
 Initially, when Ramanujan sent his research work to Professor Hardy, at first he did not even understand
 jab unhone apane mitra ganitagyon se salaah lee to ve is nishkarsh par pahunche ki ramanujan ganit ke kshetra main ek durlabh vyaktitv he or inke dwaara kiye gaye kaary ko thik se samajhane or usamen aage shodh ke liye unhen england aana chahie
 So he invited Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 kuch vyaktigat kaarnon or dhan kii kami ke kaaran ramanujan ne professor hardi ke cambridge ke aamantran ko asweekaar kar diya
 Professor Hardy was disappointed by this but somehow decided to call Ramanujan there
 isi samay ramanujan ko madras vishvavidhyalay main shodh vritti mil gai thi jisase unka jivan kuch saral ho gaya or unako shodhakarya ke liye puraa samay bhi milane laga tha
 Meanwhile, after a long correspondence, slowly, Professor Hardy agreed Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 professor hardi ke prayaason se ramanujan ko cambridge jane ke liye aarthik sahaayta bhi mil gai
 Ramanujan had written over 3000 new sources of mathematics in his notebook before leaving for England
 ramanujan ne landan kii dharti par kadam rakhaa
 Professor Hardy had already arranged for him there, so he did not face any particular problem
 england main ramanujan ko bas thodi pareshaani thi or iskaa kaaran tha unka sharmila, shant swabhaav or shuddh satvik jeevancharya
 Throughout his stay in England, he mostly cooked his own food
 england kii is yatra se unke jivan main krantikari parivartan aayaa
 He, along with Professor Hardy, published high-quality research papers
 apane ek vishesh shodh ke kaaran inhen cambridge vishvavidhyalay dwaara bi
e
 kii oopaadhi bhi mili
 But the climate and living style there was not very favorable to him and his health started deteriorating
 doctoron ne ise kshay rog bataaya
 At that time there was no tuberculosis medicine and the patient had to stay in the sanatorium
 ramanujan ko bhi kuch dinon tak vahaan rahanaa padaa
 Even at this time, he used to make new imaginations in the mathematical formulas
 iske baad vahaan ramanujan ko royal socity kaa phelo namit kiya gaya
 At a time when India was living in slavery, it was a great thing for a black person to get membership of the Royal Society
 royal socity ke puure itihaas main inase kam aayu kaa koi sadsy aaj tak nahin hua he
 His well-wishers celebrated and held gatherings all over India
 royal socity kii sadsyta ke baad yah triniti college kii fellowship paane vaale pehle bhartiya bhi bane
 Now it seemed that everything was going to a very good place
 lekin ramanujan kaa swasthya girtaa ja rahaa tha or ant main doctoron kii salaah par unhen waapas bharat lautnaa padaa
 On coming to India, he got a professor job at Madras University
 or ramanujan adhyaapan or shodh kaary main punah ram gaye
 Even after returning to India, health did not support them and the condition was getting serious
 is beemaari kii dasha main bhi inhone mock theta function par ek ucch stareey shodhpatr likhaa
 This function, propounded by Ramanujan, is used not only in mathematics but also in medical science to understand cancer
 inkaa girtaa swasthya sabake liye chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya or yahaan tak kii ab doctoron ne bhijawab de diya tha
 Finally, the moment of Ramanujan's departure arrived
 26 april1920 ke praatah kaal main ve achet ho gaye or dopaher hote hote unhone praan tyaag die
 At this time Ramanujan's age was only 33 years
 inkaa asamay nidhan ganit jagat ke liye apurnty kshati tha
 Whoever heard the news of Ramanujan's death in the whole country and abroad was shocked
 ramanujan or inke dwaara kiye gaye adhikansh kaary abhi bhi vaigyanikon ke liye abujh paheli bane hue hai
 In his journey to surprise the whole world by taking birth in a very common family, he gave India unprecedented glory
 inkaa unka vah purana register jis par ve apane prameya or sutron ko likhaa karte the 1976 main achaanak triniti college ke pustkaalay main mila
 This register of about one hundred pages remains a puzzle for scientists even today
 is register ko baad main ramanujan kii note book ke naam se janaa gaya
 It has also been published by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai
 ramanujan ke shodhon kii tarah unke ganit main kaam karne kii style bhi vicitra thi
 He sometimes woke up in the middle of the night by writing mathematics formulas on the slate and then falling asleep
 is tarah aisa lagata tha ki ve sapane main bhi ganit ke prashn hal kar rahe hon
 Along with Ramanujan's name, his Kuldevi is also taken
 inhone shunya or anant ko hameshaa dhyaan main rakhaa or iske antarsambandhon ko samajhane ke liye ganit ke sutron kaa sahaara liya
 There was a specialty of Ramanujan's work
 pehle ve ganit kaa koi nayaa sutara yaa prameny pehle likh dete the lekin uski upapatti par utana dhyaan nahin dete the
 When asked about this, he used to say that he received this sutra by the grace of Namagiri Devi
 ramanujan kaa aadhyatm ke prati vishwaas itnaa gaharaa tha ki ve apane ganit ke kshetra main kiye gaye kisi bhi kaary ko aadhyatm kaa hi ek ang maanate the
 He not only believed in religion and spirituality but also presented it logically
 ve kehete the ki "mere liye ganit ke us sutara kaa koi matlab nahin he jisase mujhe aadhyatmik vichaar na milte hon
 " ramanujan ne england main paanch varshon tak mukhyatah sankhya siddhanth ke kshetra main kaam kiya
 Ramanujan gave the following formula - is sutara kii visheshta yah he ki yah ganit ke do sabase prasiddh niyatankon kaa sambandh ek anant satat bhinn ke madhyam se vyakt karata he
 He also gave another formula for pie - 'ramanujan sankhya' us prakritik sankhya ko kehete hai jise do alag-alag prakaar se do sankhyaon ke ghanon ke yoga dwaara nirupit kiya ja saktaa he
 Example - 9 3 + 10 3 = 1 3 + 12 3 = 1729 { \ displaystyle 9 ^ {3} + 10 ^ {3} = 1 ^ {3} + 12 ^ {3} = 1729}
 isi prakaar, Hence Ramanujan numbers are 1729, 4104, 20683, 39312, 40033 etc

 Fuzzy logic is a type of multi-value argument in which the true values of the variables can be anything between 0 and 1
 iskaa upyog 'aanshik satya' kii avadharana ke anuroop he kyonki praayah ham jivan main pate hai ki koi tark na purnatah 'satya' hota he na purnatah 'asaty'
 In contrast, the values of variables in boolean logic are either 0 or 1
 digital paripath booleey tark par hi kaam karte hai
 The term 'fuzzy logic' was first used by Lotfi Jadeh in 1965 with the rendering of the obscure set-theory
 kintu aspasht tark kaa adhyayan 1920 ke dashak ke samay se hi chal rahaa tha jisko anant-maan tark kehete the
 Fuzzy logic is used efficiently in many fields with some key areas - control theory, artificial intelligence, etc
 truth or probabiletis kii donon digriyon kaa range 0 or 1 ke bich hota he or isliye shuru-shuru main ye ek jaise lag sakate hai
 However, ideologically they differ; Truth represents membership in an ambiguously defined set that is not the liquidity of an event or condition, like probability theory
 udhaaharan ke liye, 100 ml kaa ek gilaas lete hai jisamen 30 ml jal he
 Then we can consider two concepts: Empty and Full
 inamen se prayek ke arth ko ek nishchit fazi set ke dwaara pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Only then one can define this glass as 0
7 empty and 0
3 filled glass
 dhyaan den ki khalipan kii avadharana, subjective hogi or is prakaar yah paryvekshak yaa diziner par nirbhar karegi
 The second designer will also design a set membership work equally well where the glass will be considered filled for all values below 50 ml
 It is important to understand that fuzzy logic uses the Truth degrees as a mathematical model of the velocity phenomenon while probability is a mathematical model of randomness
 ek probabilistic setting sabase pehle gilaas ke puraa bharaa hone ke liye ek scaler veriable ko paribhaashit karegaa or phir probability kaa varnan karte hue condishnal distributions ko paribhaashit karegaa jise koi vyakti ek vishisht purnataa ke str ko darshaakar gilaas ko bharaa hua kahegaa
 haalanki, kuch ghatana ke ghatit hone kii sweekruti ke bina is model kaa koi arth nahin he, udhaaharan ke liye, kuch minute ke baad, gilaas aadha khaali ho jayega
 dhyaan den ki condishning ko ek spacific obzarwar ko rakhkar praapt kiya ja saktaa he jo gilaas ke liye str or niyatatmak paryvekshakon ke ek vitaran yaa donon kaa aniyamit rup se chayan karata he
 As a result, probability has nothing but fuzziness, these are just different concepts that look similar from the outside because they use the same interval of real numbers
 de morgan ke prameya main dohari prayojyata or aniyamit veriables ke gun hai
 Nevertheless, since such theorems correspond to the properties of binary logic states, one can see where confusion can occur
 ek basic anuprayog, ek satat parivartaneey ke up-shreniyon ko parilakshyit kar saktaa he
 For example, measurement of the temperature of anti-lock brakes may include functions with several different memberships defining particular temperature ranges that are necessary to control brakes well
 prayek function, ek truth vailu ke usee taapmaana vailu ko chitrit karata he jiskaa range 0 se 1 ke bich hota he
 These truth values can then be used to determine ways of controlling the brakes
 is image main, cold, warm or hot abhivyaktiyon ke arth ko ek taapmaana scale ke functions masping ke zariye darshaya gaya he
 a point on that scale has three "truth values" - one value for each of the three functions
 The vertical line of the image represents a particular temperature through three arrow gages
 chunki laal tir shunya ko suchit karata he isliye is taapmaana ko "note hot" mana ja saktaa he
 The orange arrow may describe it as "slitly warm" and the blue arrow as "fairly cold"
 jabaki ganit main veriables saadharantah sankhyatmak vailus ko grahan karte hai lekin fazi logic ke anuprayogon main, gaiyr-sankhyatmak bhashaai veriables kaa praayah niyamon or tathyon kii abhivyakti kii suvidha pradaan karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 a linguistic variable such as age may include a value such as young or young or vice versa, old or old
 haalanki, bhashaai veriables kii sabase badi prayojyata yahi he ki praathmik sharton par lagu bhashaai hejej ke madhyam se ise sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Linguistic hedges may be associated with certain functions

 Fuzzy set theory defines fuzzy operators on fuzzy sets
 iske anuprayog main yahi samasya he ki upyukt fazi prachaalak gyaat nahin ho saktaa he
 For this reason, fuzzy logic typically uses or structures IF-THEN rules, such as fuzzy associative matrices
 niyamon ko aam taur par nimna rup se vyakt kiya jaataa he: IF veriable IS property THEN ection For example, a simple temperature regulator that uses a fan can look like this: yadi taapmaana bahut sheethal he to pankhe ko roak den yadi taapmaana sheethal he to pankhe ko dhimaa kar den yadi taapmaana saamaanya he to is str ko banaae rakhen yadi taapmaana garm he to pankhe kii gati badha den There is no "ELSE" - all rules are evaluated because temperatures can be "cold" and "normal" in different degrees at the same time
 boolian logic ke AND, OR tathaa NOT prachaalak, fazi logic main maujuud hote hai jinhen aam taur par minimum, maximum or complement ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he; jab unhen is tarah se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he tab unhen zaadeh prachaalak kaha jaataa he
 Hence for fuzzy variables x and y: NOT x = ) x AND y = minimum, truth)x OR y = maximum, truth) There are other operators who are linguistic in nature and are called hedges and can also be applied
 ye aam taur par edwarbs hote hai, jaise - "veri" yaa "samawhat", jo ek ganitiya sutara kaa prayog karke set ke arth ko sanshodhit kar dete hai
 In the application, the programming language prolog is well equipped to implement fuzzy logic along with its facilities to establish a database of "rules" that are asked to reduce logic
 is tarah kii programing ko logic programing ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Once fuzzy relations are defined, it becomes possible to develop a fuzzy relational database

 ganitiya logic main, "fazi logic" ke kai aupchaarik systams hai; unamem se adhikansh tathakthith tii-norm fazi logics se sambandhit hai
 The most important propositional fuzzy logics are: ye uparokt-ullikhit fazi logic main universal or exystential quantifiers ko thik usee prakaar se yoga karke iskaa vistaar karte hai jis prakaar se proposishnal logic se predicket logic nirmit hota he
 The semantics of universal quantifiers in T-normal fuzzy logics are inferences of the Truth degrees of examples of quantified sub-formula
 ye logics, jinhen fazi tip theori bhi kaha jaataa he, predicket fazi logics kaa vistaar karte hai taaki predikets or hyer-order objects ko bhi quantiphoi karne main sakasham ho sake

 In the context, the function h is increasing and s = lim h

 One such theory, proposed in the general case of L-subsets, is proposed in Gerla 2006

 In particular, the fuzzy set of true formulas based on logic is recursively enumerable despite the fact that the crisp set of valid formulas is generally not recursively enumerable
 iske alaava, koi bhi exeomaticable or complit theori, disidable hota he
 It is a free question to support the church thesis of fuzzy logic that claims that the proposed notion of recursive enumerability of fuzzy subsets is a sufficient assumption

 The motivations of the creation of these war poems were the same events in the history of the Baloch caste that took place in that period; Such as the 30-year struggle of the Rind and lashari tribes, the vivid tale of the immortal love of Hani-shah Murid, Beberg and Giranaz and narratives, the antics of Shahdad and Mahnaz, the valor and courage of Shahdad and his followers in the Battle of Panipat because of Humayun's friendship , The war against Beberg Pusser for the singularity of Jusur and Ghayur Balach and other similar incidents gave rise to such high-quality war poetry

 But not all poets of this period are busy searching for a cosmic lover
 yah avashya he ki ve ek chalati phirti tathaa dikhaai denevaali premika kii khoj main nikalate hai par aisa bhi hota he ki ve aisi loukik premika kii khoj karte hue vaastavik premika ko paa lete hai
 Whenever this happens, worldly poetry is seen touching the boundaries of Sufi poetry

 This resulted in his creation "sebastopol Sketches"

 After returning from the yatra, he opened a school in his village Yasnaya Polyana for the children of farmers

 In this, the present test system and the system of passing failed on its basis was not kept

 Its revolutionary ideas are such that due to which it was not allowed to publish in Russia and the book was published in Switzerland

 In the period from 1878 to 1885, Tolstoy remained inactive in terms of creating literary literature
 unki antarvruti maanav jivan ke rahasy kii khoj main uljhi rahi
 All of Ambakat's compositions began to seem futile to him
 par 1886 main ve pun: ucchkoti ke siddhhast upanyaas lekhak ke rup main saamne aae or isi varsh unki mahaan upanyasik rachana '"evan ilich kii mrityu"' prakashit hui
 The whole world had become enlightened by their ethos of faith and the recognition of Yasnaya Polyana Village had become famous as an excellent pilgrimage center

 It was during these days that he read Tolstoy's compositions and was attracted to them

 'punarutthan' naamak apane upanyaas kii samast aay unhone rus kii shantivaadee jati dukhebor logon ko rus kaa parityag kar canada main ja basane ke liye de di
 Suddenly in 1910, he decided to abandon his ancestral village "yasnaya Polyana" forever
 10 navambar 1910 ko apni putree eleclandra ke saath unhonen prasthaan kiya, par 22 navbanr 1910 ko maarg ke stesan astapovo main aksmaat fefde main dah hone se vahiin unka sharirant ho gaya
 His religion was very liberal and comprehensive
 tatkaaleen isai dharm ke prati unki spashtat: virdohi bhaavana thi
 From his thoughts he seems to be a kind of omnipotentist
 mrityu ko ve sharir kii antim ore avashyambhavi parinti maanate the
 He considered man as the ultimate and inevitable culmination of the body
 manushya ke sampark main aanevaali prayek vastu ko upyogita ke maandand se aankana ve uchit samajhate the or isi kaaran jivan kii soddeshyata ke prati ve sarvada jigyaasu bane rahe
 They considered a purposeless, thoughtless and autistic life as a kind of sin; Even he considered sexual intercourse only for the purpose of procreation
 manovaigyanik rachanaaon main fyodor dostoyevski hi tolastay ke samakaksh thaharte hai
 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to move forward
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles
 tolastoy ke 'jivan-shikshak' hone kaa jhooth udaarataavaadiyon kii dekha-dekhi kuch bhootpurv saamaajik-janavaadee bhi duhara rahe hai
 The Russian people will gain independence only if they understand that they have to learn to fight for a better life, not from Tolstoy, but from a class whose importance Tolstoy could not understand and that old world, which Tolstoy hated
 , Is the only class capable of overthrow - that is, from the proletariat
 22 janvari 1911 ko lenin ne punah vistaar se tolastoy kii kuch kathatmak rachanaaon ke saath-saath anek cathetar rachanaaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastowad main pratikriyaavaadi tathaa utapian tatv hone ke baavjood aaj se 25 varsh pehle janata ke kuch halkon ke liye shaayad kabhi-kabhi tolastoy ke siddhanton ke aalochanatmak tatwon kii vyavhaarik upyogita ho sakati thi
 But now, for example in the last decade, such a thing could not happen, because from the ninth decade of the last century to the end of the century, historical development has moved very far
 atah aaj jab uparokt ghatnaon ne 'purvi' gatiheenata kaa ant kar diya he, aaj, jab 'vekhi'-panthiyon ke sachetan rup se pratikriyaavaadi, sankeern-vargeey tathaa swaarthee-vargeey arthon main pratikriyaavaadi vichaar udaaravaadi burjua logon main itane vyapak rup se fail gayi hai, aaj, jab in vichaaron kii chhot kuch dikhaau marxvaadiyon ko bhi lag gayi he, jiskaa parinaam 'visarjanwaadee' pravriti he, to tolastoy ke siddhanton ko adarsh bataane, unke 'apratirodh' unki 'aatma' kii duhaayiyon, 'atmoddhar' ke liye unke aahvaan, 'antahkaran' or vishwa 'prem' ke siddhant, tapasyavaad or quaitism ke unke upadesh, aadi-aadi ko uchit tehraane yaa un par lipapoti karne kii har koshish pratyakshtam or gahanatam haani hi karti he
 Leo Tolstoy dedicated websites Biographies and critiques Leo Tolstoy in the media bharat sarkaar ne desh main baadhya shram yaa bandhua mazdooree ke mudde par nirantar kathor rukh apanaaya he
 It considers the violation of the fundamental human rights of the citizens affected by this cruelty and is determined to complete its completion in as short a time as possible
 bandhua mazdooree pranali adhinium 1976 ko lagu karke bandhua mazdooree pranali ko 25 oktober 1975 se sampurna desh se khatm kar diya gaya
 Through this act the bonded laborers were freed from slavery as well as their debt also ended
 yah gulaami kii pratha ko kanoon dwaara ek sangyeya dandaneey aparaadh bana diya
 This Act is being implemented by the respective State Governments
 bandhua mazaduri pratha adhinium, 1976 bandhua mazaduri kii pratha unmoolan hetu adhiniyamit kiya gaya tha taaki jansankhya ke kamazor virgon ke aarthik or vaastavik shoshan ko roka ja sake or unase jude evam anushanbee maamalon ke sambandh main karrwai kii ja sake
 This freed all the bonded laborers from unilateral bond and at the same time liquidated their debts
 isane bandhua pratha ko kanoon dwaara dandaneey sangyeya aparaadh mana
 This law is being administered and implemented by the Ministry of Labor and the respective State Governments
 rajya sarkaron ke prayaason kii anupurti karne ke liye mantralay dwaara bandhua mazaduron ke punarvaas kii ek kendriya pryojit yojana skim shuru kii gai thi
 Under this scheme, central assistance is provided to the State Governments on the basis of equivalent grants for rehabilitation of bonded laborers
 adhinium ke mukhya praavdhaan is prakaar hai:- The service rendered by children in their childhood in any area is called child labor
 ise gaiyr-jimmedaar mata-pita kii vajah se, yaa kam laagat main nivesh par apane phaayde ko badhaane ke liye maalikon dwaara jabarajasti banaae gaye dabaav kii vajah se jivan jeene ke liye jaruri sansadhano kii kami ke chalate ye bacchon dwaara swat: kiya jaataa he, iskaa kaaran myne nahin rakhata kyonki sabhi karkon kii vajah se bachche bina bachapan ke apana jivan jeene ko majaboor hote he
 Childhood is the special and happiest moment in everyone's life in which children learn nature, loved ones and how to live life from their parents
 saamaajik, bauddhik, shaareerik, or maansik sabhi drushtikon se bal mazdooree bacchon kii vruddhi or vikaas main avrodh kaa kaam karata he
 If we look at the Child Labor Prohibition and Regulation Act 1986, it is completely prohibited to get children to work in 18 businesses and 65 processes
 chaay kii dukaanon, dhabon, hotalon, sadak kinare khan-paan ke thikaanon or gharon main karaae jane vaale kaam bhi in khatarnaak vyavsaayon main shaamil hai
 The work of domestic servant has been brought to this list from 10 October 2006
 jo kshetra is adhinium ke antargat nahin aate, vahaan bhi 14 varsh se kam umr ke bacchon se kaam karaane ke kuch maanak tay kiye gaye hai
 Like one hour rest after three hours of work, and no work to be taken between 7 pm and 8 am
 bacchon se overtime karana bilkul manaa he
 But how many owners will follow these rules can be understood by themselves
 gharelu naukaraaniyon ke saath marpet, khaanaa na dene, band karke rakhane or shaareerik shoshan ke kai maamle pichley dinon media main chhaae rahe
 Under the Right to Information Act, when the Union Labor Ministry tried to know how many children were identified and freed from roadside catering shops and homes across the country in the last five years, the figures were missing
 rajasthan sarkaar se yah jaankaree maangi gai to vahaan ke shram vibhaag ne bataaya ki pichley paanch varshon main puure pradesh se sirf 10 bacchon se kaam chhudvaaya gaya
 In these five years, the Central Labor Department found only 4 domestic workers in Mumbai, 55 in Delhi and 13 in Chennai
 kolkata main ek bhi nahin
 If we look at the causes of child labor, poverty is definitely the main reason
 par ek taraf garibi kii vajah se bal mazdooree he, to duusari taraf bal shram ke chalate bhi garibi badhati he
 Children are made to work because of being cheap laborers

 With the removal of child laborers from work, it is also important to pay attention to their rehabilitation

 nimna raktchaap vah daab he jisase dhamniyon or nason main rakt kaa pravaah kam hone ke lakshan yaa sanket dikhaai dete hai
 When the blood flow is very low, oxygen and nutritious substances cannot reach the vital senses like brain, heart and kidneys, due to which these senses do not work normally and this can cause permanent damage
 ucch raktchaap ke vipareet, nimna raktchaap kii pahchaan multah lakshan or sanket se hoti he, na ki vishisht daab sankhya ke
 Some people have a blood pressure of 90 / 50 but they do not show any symptoms of low blood pressure and hence they do not have low blood pressure, however in those people whose blood pressure is high and their blood pressure falls to 100 / 60 Symptoms of low blood pressure begin to appear
 yadi kisi ko nimna raktchaap ke kaaran chakkar aata ho yaa mitli aati ho yaa khadey hone par behosh hokar gir padataa ho to use orthostetic ucch raktchaap kehete hai
 The normal person is able to control the effect caused by low pressure on standing
 lekin jab paryaapt raktchaap ke kaaran chakree dhamni main rakt kii aapurti nahin hoti he to vyakti ko seene main dard ho saktaa he yaa dil kaa daura pad saktaa he
 When there is insufficient blood supply in the kidneys, the kidneys cannot remove wastes like urea and creatine from the body, due to which their quantity in the blood is increased

 Top honor 1094 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 1094 BCE or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 1094 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 mansapeshiy smriti kisi kaary ko mansapeshi kii sahaayta se kai baar lagaataar karne par us mansapeshi ko vah kaary yaad rahata he or ham us kaary ko jaldi kar pate hai
 If we do any task for a long time, then we do not need to think much to do that task because this muscle makes our work
 yah kriya dimag ko adhik sochane or adhik kaary karne se bachaati he
 Main examples of this are cycling, using the keyboard, etc
 yadi koi dimag main chot aadi ke kaaran apni smriti kho bhi de to vah is prakaar ke kaaryon ko karnaa nahin bhul saktaa
 But for this, any work has to be done for a long time, till your body incorporates it in its habit to do that work
 kisi bhi prakaar ke vaahan ko chalaanaa sikhte samay dimag ko kabhi kabhi yaad nahin rahata kii kaise gaadi rokna he or kaise disha badalanaa he
 But gradually when we practice more on it, it starts to be controlled by our muscles just like memory
 lagbhag 1900 sadi main ek anusandhan ke pashchaat is baat kaa pataa chalaa tha
 After this, a research was also done in the year 1987 which confirmed this
 iske alaava kuch anusandhano main yah bhi paaya gaya kii likhte samay bhi mansapeshiy smriti kaa hi upyog kiya jaataa he
 Earlier it was called vehicle memory but now it is called muscle memory
 1900 sadi main iske prati logon kaa aakarshan bahut tha
 Due to which many researches were done, from which it was found out that this memory is not memorized only by some time of practice but it is automatically memorized by years of practice
 iske saath hi yah bhi pataa chalaa kii yah koi vishesh kaary jaise gaadi chalaanaa aadi main hi nahin hota balki puure jivan main ham jo bhi kaary karte rahete hai vah sabhi kaary hamaare mansapeshi main smriti ke rup main yaad hote rahete hai
 So that we can do that work with more speed
 kisi bhi vaahan ko chalaanaa sikhte samay ham dhimi gati ke saath or kai baadhaon ke saath hi sikhte hai
 This task is difficult while learning and when we practice it becomes easier
 yah mukhya rup se do prakaar kii hoti he
 The first which is for some time and the second which is longer
 mansapeshi smriti kutabandhan ko bhi mansapeshiy smriti kehete hai
 Training how to use power means to use it properly
 yadi hamen kisi bhi kaary ko karne main asahajata hoti he to ham phir bhi us kaary ko karte hai to hamen us par kis prakaar se shakti kaa upyog karnaa he yah samaj main aa jaataa he
 Apart from this, our body also gets adapted to do that work
 hamaara sharir har kaary ko karne ke liye sakasham nahin he or na hi ham anya logon ke jaise kaary ko kar sakate hai
 Because any work that another person is doing has happened after many years of effort
 udhaaharan ke liye jab ham koi bhi vajan kaa saamaan uthaate hai to vah yadi adhik baari hota he to ham use nahin uthaa sakate parantu koi or use sahajata se uthaa saktaa he kyonki uske mansapeshi main adhik vajan ke saamaan ko uthaane hetu anukool ban chukaa he
 On the other hand, if you do something that no other person is able to do, it means that you have become fit to do that work in your muscle

 The origins of the Moon are generally believed to have struck the body of a Mars, forming a debris ring and eventually collected into a natural satellite, the Moon, but there are many variations on this massive impact hypothesis, as well as alternative explanations and Research into how the moon was released
 anya prastaavit paristhitiyon main kabja nikaay, vikhandan, ek saath ekatrit, grahon sambandhi takaraav, or takaraav siddhant shaamil hai
 The standard giant-effect hypothesis states a Mars-shaped body, called the thia, has an impact on the Earth, creating a large debris ring around the Earth, which then enters as the Moon
