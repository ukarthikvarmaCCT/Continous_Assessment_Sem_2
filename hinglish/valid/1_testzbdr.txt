 Ludwig Wittgenstein was the philosopher of Austria
 unhone tarkshastra, ganit kaa darshan, man kaa darshan, evam bhashaa ke darshan par mukhyatah kaary kiya
 He is counted among the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century
 unke jite ji ek hi pustak prakashit ho pai - Tractatus logico-philosophicus
 Philosophical Investigations became quite popular in later published books
 vitgenshtin cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke professor rahe hai
 Wittgenstein's father Karl was a Jew who later adopted the Protestant religion
 vitganstin kaa sabase bada yogadan bhashaa ko darshanik paripekshya main rakhane kaa he
 When anyone mentions philosophy in linguistics today, Wittgenstein's name is automatically remembered
 vitganstin ke lekhan se kaaphi tark-vitark upja he, yahan tak ki kai baar vitganstin ke kaam ko darshanavipareet bhi kaha gaya he, kintu aisa kahana isaliye galat hoga ki vitganstin se pehle bhi tarkshastriyon ne bhashaa ke taarkik vishleshan par jor daalaa tha
 Wittgenstein's Guru Bertrand is contributing heavily to give logic a proper place in philosophy
 vitganstin kaa darshanik jivan kaaphi dilachasp he kyonki unhone apane baad ke kaaryon main apane puraane kaaryon kaa khandan kiya he
 In his earlier books, Wittgenstein appears to state the importance of language for truth, but in his last book, "philosophical Investigations", Wittgenstein describes the prevalence of language in bias
 vitganstin kaa ye nishkarsh darshanik jagat ke liye nutan or mahatvapurn siddh hua
 In a way, Wittgenstein conceived the idea that language does not describe truth but construct truth
 samast paashchaatya darshan bhashaa main hi nihit he, kintu bhashaa hamen satya kaa ek rup hi pradarshit karti he, vah satya jo ham apni manyata yaa anubhav se nirmit karte hai
 Wittgenstein repeatedly mentions a language play, in which participants create and use language to express the truth
 is krida ke madhyam se vitgenstin bhashaa se vivirat tathyon va satya main antar bataate hai
 In his negative book "philosophical Investigations" he states that "most of the times when we talk about the" meaning "of a word, we only talk about the use of that word in one language"

 Four Vaishnava sects stood there against Shankaracharya's advaitaism and Mayaism
 in chaaron sampradaayon ne uttar bharat main vishnu ke avtaron kaa prachaarprasar kiya
 One of these was promoted by Ramanujacharya, whose disciple Ramananda preached Rambhakti in North India

 In the field of Bhakti, Ramanand laid special emphasis on eradicating discrimination of high order
 ram ke sagun or nirgun do roopon ko maananevaale do bhakton - kabir or tulsi ko inhone prabhavit kiya
 At the same time, Ballabhacharya ran his Pushtimarg on the basis of Vishnuswamy's Shuddhavaita opinion

 The representatives of the first are Kabir and the second is Jaisi

 Though the primacy of thought is among the poets of the Jnanmārgi branch, the secular form of love is expressed in the works of Sufis

 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain has raised questions about the nature of Nirguna bhakti and has proposed that Nirguna bhakti of saints has its own form which cannot be interpreted in the context of Vedanta philosophy
 unke shabd hai: From the scriptural point of view all the above questions seem to challenge the nature of 'nirguna-bhakti'

 He then attacks the village on Holi day and takes Jai and Viru hostage after a long fight
 thakur un donon kii madad karne kii sthiti main hote hue bhi unki madad nahin karata

 Jai goes to save them, and the three of them escape

 Sanjeev Kumar also wanted to play the role of Gabbar Singh, but salim-javed felt that "the audience was sympathetic to him because of his earlier roles; Gabbar had to be completely disgusted
" " Sippy wanted Jai to play Shatrughan Sinha, but many other big stars were working in the film, and so Sinha refused
 amitabh bachchan us samay itane prasiddh nahin hue the; unhen is kirdaar ko paane ke liye kathor parishram karnaa padaa tha
 salim-javed, however, recommended Bachchan's name for Sholay in 1973; Because salim-javed was convinced that Bachchan was the right actor for this film after seeing his acting in the film Zanjeer

 Later, a part of Ramnagar was also renamed "sippy Nagar" in honor of the film's director
 2010 tak, "sholay chattaanon" kii ek yatra bhi ramnagar aane vaale paryatakon ke liye uplabdh thi
 Filming began on 3 October 1973, filming a scene of Bachchan and Bhaduri
 film kaa nirmaan apane samay ke liye bhavy tha; aksar kalakaaron ke liye partiyon or bhojon kaa aayojan hota rahata tha, or is kaaran iskaa bajet to badha hi, saathi hi ise puraa karne main dhai saal lag gaye
 One of the reasons for its high cost was that Sippy re-shot the scenes he had shot several times to get his desired effect
 geet "ye dosti" ke 5 minute ke geet anukram ko shoot karne main 21 din lag gaye, do chote drishy jisamen radha deepak jalaati he, prakaash kii samasyaon ke kaaran 20 dinon main filmaae ja sake, or ek drishy, jisamen gabbar imam ke bete kii hatya karata he, 19 dinon main jaakar shoot ho paaya
 The theft scene in the train, which was filmed near Panvel on the mumbai-pune railroad, was completed in more than 7 weeks
 sholay steriophonic soundtrack rakhane or 70 mimi widescreen praaroop kaa upyog karne vaali pehali bhartiya film thim
 However, real 70mm cameras were expensive at the time, so the film was first shot on traditional 35mm film, and the 4: 3 images made from it were later converted to 2
2: 1 frames
 is prakriya ke bare main sippi ne kaha, "ek 70 mimi praaroop badi screen kaa vaastavik anand detaa he or tasviir ko or bhi bada banane ke liye iskaa or adhik aavardhan karata he, lekin chunki main dhwani kaa bhi baraabar prasar chahta tha, to hamane 'chah trek-steriophonic' dhwani kaa prayog kiya or phir ise badi screen ke saath sanyukt kiya
 This was definitely a differentiator
 " film ke postaron dwaara bhi iske 70 mimi kii film ke upyog par jor diya gaya, jin par film kaa naam cinemascope ke logo se mail khaataa hua sa shailibaddh kiya gaya tha
 The film's posters also served to distinguish Sholay from other films older than this; One of them even added the English tagline: "the Greatest Starcast Ever Assembled - The Greatest Story Ever Told" vastav main jo film us samay filmaayi gayi thi, uskaa ant bahut alag tha
 Thakur kills Gabbar in the original story, and apart from this there were many such scenes, which were different in the original story
 gabbar kii mrityu kaa drishy, or iske saath saath gabbar dwaara imam ke bete kii hatya or thakur ke parivaar ke narsanhaar vaale sabhi drishyon ko bhartiya sensor board ne hataa diya tha
 The Censor Board was concerned that people should not be affected by such violent scenes and people would not be killed in the same way to take revenge on other people irrespective of the law
 haalanki sippi ne is drishy ko film kaa hissaa banaae rakhane ke liye kaaphi ladaai ladi, par baad main is drishy ko sensor board ke nirdeshaanusaar phir se shoot kiya gaya, jisamen thakur ke gabbar ko maarane se kuch hi samay pehle police aa jaati he
 For 15 years before it was screened in theaters, people got to see the film directed by the censor board
 1990 main iskaa bina sensor kiya hua british sanskaran vieches main pradarshit hua
 Eros Entertainment then released two separate DVD versions of it; The first was an uncensored 204-minute original film, and the second was a 198-minute film approved by the censor board
 vidwaanon ne film ke kai vishyon kaa ullekh kiya he, jaise ki hinsa kii mahima, saamanti vichaaron kaa parivartan, saamaajik vyavastha ko banaae rakhane waalon or sangathit hokar lut karne waalon ke bich bahes, samalangik gaiyr romani saamaajik bandhan or rashtriya ruparekha ke rup main film kii bhoomika
 Kaushik Banerjee, a sociologist at the London School of Economics, noted that Sholay demonstrated a "sympathetic construction of fake virility" through the examples of Jai and Viru
 banerjee ne yah bhi tark diya ki film ke dauraan vaidhata or aapraadhikta ke bich kii naitik seemaa dhire-dhire khatm ho jaati he
 Film scholar Vimal Dissanayake agrees that the film served to bring "a new stage in the dialectic developed between violence and social order" in Indian cinema
 film vidwaan em
 madhav prasad ke anusaar jai or viru ek haashie vaali aabaadi kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai jo paramparaagat samaaj main pesh kii jaati he
 Prasad also said that, through the elements of revenge, while highlighting the criminality of Jai and Veeru, the way they were embedded in the story, it reflected reactionary politics, forcing the audience to accept the feudal order
 is
 banerjee ne samajhaayaa ki yadhyapi jai or viru dusht hai, lekin phir bhi ve apni bhaavnaatmak jaruraton ke kaaran se maanviya hai, or is tarah kaa dwaitvaad unhen gabbar singh kii shuddh buraai ke saamne kamjor banaata he
 The villain of the film, Gabbar Singh, received good reactions from the audience despite his widespread sadistic cruelty
 disanayake bataate hai ki darshakon ko charitra ke samvaad or vyavhaar se mohit kiya gaya tha, or inhen tatwon ne gabbar ke karnaamon par pardaa daalane kaa bhi kaam kiya, jo ki kisi bhartiya drama film main pehali baar hua tha
 He noted that the portrayal of violence in the film was seductive but unbearable
 unhone aage kaha ki, "puraani drama filmon ke vipareet, jinamein maadaa sharir darshakon ke dhyaan ko apni ore aakarshith rakhata tha, sholay main ek nar centrebindu par he; yah ek yuddh ke maidan sa he jahaan achchhai or buraai ke bich sarvocchata ke liye pratispardhaa chalati he
 Dissanayake argues that Sholay can be seen as an icon of the national framework: it lacks a cozy logical narrative, it repeatedly challenges social stability, and at the same time lacks emotion in human Depreciation of life is also shown
 ek saath rakhane par, ye sabhi tatv bharat kaa pratikatmak pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Sholay's narrative style, its violence, and the actions of revenge and vigilance are sometimes compared by scholars to political unrest in India at the time of its release
 yah tanaav 1975 main pradhan mantri indira gandhi dwaara ghoshit apatkaal main samaapt hua
 Dissanayake and Sahay also noted the fact that, although many elements in the film were derived from Hollywood's Western style films, especially its scenes, the film was still successfully "indianized"
 udhaaharan ke taur par, wiliam vine der hide ne sholay main ek narsanhaar drishy kii tulana vans apon e time in da west ke ek drishy se kii thi
 Although both films were similar in technical style, Sholay emphasized the values and melodramatic tradition of Indian families, whereas Western films were more materialistic and restrained in outlook
 inacychlopedia of hindi cinema main maithili raav ne note kiya ki sholay western style ko "saamantivaadi vichaar" main dhaal detii he
 Ted Shane of the Chicago Reader noted Sholay's "historical Visual Style" and the intermittent "populist Message"
 saanskrithik aalochak or islamvaadi vidwaan jiauddin sardaar ne apni pustak da sikret politics of a desers: inosense, kalpapebility and indian popular cinema main sholay main muslim or mahila paatro kii roodhiwaadeeta par prahaar kiya, jise unhone "nirdosh graminon ke majaak" kaha
 Sardar noted that the film had two major Muslim characters; Surma Bhopali, and another a helpless victim of dacoits; Additionally, the only function of a female character is to face fate by remaining silent, while the other female character is nothing but a beautiful rural woman
 kuch vidwaanon ne sanket diya he ki sholay main samalangik gaiyr prem prasangayukt vishay bhi hai
 Ted Shane describes the relationship shown between Jay and Veeru in the film as compared to the camp genre
 apni pustak bollywood and globalaligeshan: indian popular cinema, nesan and diaspora main dina holtzman kaa kahana he ki jai kii mrityu ne donon purush paatro ke bich ke sambandhon ko todane kaa kaam kiya taaki ek maanak sambandh sthapit kiya ja sake

 sholay film 15 agast 1975 ko bharat ke swatantrata diwas ke maukey par mumbai main release hui
 Due to negative reviews and lack of effective publicity, the film did not do much for the first two weeks of its debut, although its viewership began to grow from the third week onwards due to positive oral hype
 shuruaati hafton main film kii dhimi kamai avadhi ke dauraan, nirdeshak or lekhak ne film ke kuch drishyon ko phir se filmaane par vichaar kiya taaki amitabh bachchan kaa charitra mar na sake

 This made it the highest-grossing film of all time, and these records at that time remained unbroken for nineteen years, which is also the longest time for a film to be at the top of this list

 It is often cited that after adjusting for inflation figures, Sholay is one of the highest-grossing films in the history of Indian cinema, although such figures are not known with certainty

 Sholay initially received extremely negative reactions from critics
 samakaleen aalochakon main, india today ke keel amaladi ne film ko "buje hue sholay" or "ek gambhir doshapurn prayaas" kaha
 Filmfare said the film was a failed Western-style mix with Indian society, making it a "fake Western film - neither here nor there"

 In a 2005 BBC review, the film's well-written characters and simple screenplay were praised, though Asrani and Jagdeep's comical characters were called redundant

 Specific attention has been focused on the functioning of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain
