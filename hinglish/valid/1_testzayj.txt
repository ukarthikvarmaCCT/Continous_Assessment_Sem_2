 It has wished for happiness and prosperity of various components of the nation

 There are some special properties of the Samhita Kendra, for example, if a force is applied on an object whose action goes through the Samhita Kendra of that object, then there will be only transfer speed in that object

 In other words, relative to the Samhita-center, the weighted average of the positions of all Samhita is zero

 The brief history of Vande Mataram is as follows- samvidhan visheshgy e-ji- nooraani va kavindra shukla ne 17 navambar 1998 ko ghoshnaa kii ki vande maataram ke gayan ko anivaary banaae jane kaa aadesh he or use lagu bhi kiya jayega
 Noorani then called it an unconstitutional move in the January 02–15, 1999 issue of Front Line magazine
 unhone ise samvidhan ke anuchhed 28 evam 3 kaa ullann bataaya
 These articles are as follows- No educational institution will be given religious education in any educational institution which is fully managed by the State Fund and unhone aanandamath main is geet ke yoga ke em-aar-e- beg dwaara kiye gaye villeshan april-june 1969, da indian jarnal of political science, -2, pri-120-122 ko uddhrut kiya jiske anusaar upanyaas main na ki is geet kaa sandarbh muslim virdohi he balki puraa upanyaas hi muslim virdohi he
 He quoted the presidential address of Syed Ali Imam in the second session of the All India Muslim League session on 30 December 1908, in which Vande Mataram was described as a communal call
 imam ke mahaan shabd jo unhone uddhrut karne laayak samajhe ve ye hai-‘kya akbar or aurangzeb dwaara kiya gaya yoga asafal ho gaya? Respect for all feelings and sensations, needs and needs is the basis of true Indian nationalism
 main bhartiya rashtrawaad ke shilpiyon se, chaahe ve kalakatta main hon yaa puna main, poochta hoon ki kya ve bharat ke musalamaanon se ‘vande maataram or shivaji utsav sweekaar karne kii ummid karte hai? musalmaan har maamle main kamjor ho sakate hai lekin apane svaranim ateet kii paramparaon kaa aswad lene main kamjor nahin hai
 Noorani does not even seem to pay attention to the constitution of the Indian citizen - the above mentioned basic duty, according to which - it is the basic duty of the citizen to emulate and cherish the 'great ideals' that inspire us in the national struggle for independence
 kya swatantraaa sangram main vande maataram ke adarsh se zyada prerak or kuch rahaa he? In this country, innumerable minorities have reverence for the Vande Mataram
 yah unki shraddha kaa apmaan hi tha jab agra main 10 march 2004 ko 54 musalamaanon ko jati baahar kar diya gaya or unki shaadiya shunya ghoshit kar di gai kyonki unhone yah kahin diya tha ki vande maataram gaanaa gaiyr islamic nahin he
 While issuing the fatwa, Mufti Abdul Qudus Rumi said that singing of the national anthem would bring them hell to Muslims
 bahisht logon main loha mandi or shahid nagar masjidon ke mutavalli bhi the

 The pioneer highlighted this mentality of the seer on 20 November 1998 when Muslim students said that they would not sing Vande Mataram because praying with folded hands in front of Bharat Mata's picture would not make Muslims, Muslims, because it is idolatry, because It was the conspiracy of Tagore and Gandhiji to bring "hidden Hindutva" in the freedom struggle, our children will leave school but they beat the Vande m not Gaage, 'we can not accept that are ready to die, but Vande Mataram

 The history of Vande Mataram in his words - “vande Mataram remained surrounded by one or the other only after the first publication in 1875 in Bangdarshan

 It reminds me of Jatra songs of Govind Adhikari
 majaak udaana bahut aasaan he, shamsulji majaak bananaa chahen to kisi bhi raashtragit kaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 In the national anthem of Britain, the Lord has been prayed to save the queen in every way, now the citizens of Britain should ask that why should God save the queen, why not a cancer patient? Bangladesh may be asked why in its national anthem, it is a specialty of fruits like mangoes? Why does the national song of Saudi Arabia speak of the rise of all Muslims and what is the need of the king's sycophancy in the national anthem? syria ke raashtragit main sirf ‘arabavaad kii charchaa kya ise racist nah banaati? iran ke raashtragit main yah imam kaa sandesh kya kar rahaa he? libya kaa raashtragit allaaho akbar kii pukaaren lagaataa he to kya wo dharmik hua yaa rashtriya? algeria kaa raashtragit kyon gan powder kii aawaaj ko ‘hamaari lay or mashinagan kii dhwani ko ‘hamaari raagini kahata he? america ke raashtragit main bhi ‘hawa main footte hue bam kyon hai? What is this fear book of danger in China's national anthem? How can any such commentary be made on the national anthem of any country, but these songs are and will continue to be the inspiration of millions of people of these countries for centuries
 unka uphaas hamaari asabhyataa he
 Shamsu Islam also tries to show us that the song Vande Mataram was not a great provocation and it was not just a national anthem but a Bengal song
 vah yah nahin bataate ki canada kaa raashtragit 1880 main pehali baar bajane ke sau saal baad raashtragit bana
 Until 1906 it was not even mentioned anywhere

 The song Vande Mataram came to Anandamath in 1882 but the first refusal to see it as a unifying song was in 1923 at the Kakinad Congress session by the then Congress President Maulana Ahmad Ali when he gave the Himalayan Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar of Hindustani classical music Interrupt between songs
 lekin pan paluskar ne bich main rukar kar is mahaan geet kaa apmaan nahin hone diya, pan- paluskar puraa gaanaa gaakar hi ruke
 The question is why Vande Mataram was not un-islamic for so many years? Why the conventions of the Khilafat movement started with Vande Mataram and senior Muslim leaders like Ahmad Ali, Shaukat Ali, Zafar Ali stood up in his honor
 berrister jinna pehle to iske sammaan main khadey na hone waalon ko fatkaar lagaate the
 Rafiq Zakaria has pointed this out in his recent essay
 unke anusaar muslimon dwaara vande maataram ke gayan par vivaad nirarthak he
 The song was sung by all Muslim leaders of Congress during the freedom struggle
 jo muslim ise gaanaa nahin chaahate, na gaae lekin geet ke sammaan main uthakar to khadey ho jaae kyonki iskaa ek sangharsh kaa itihaas rahaa he or yah samvidhan main raashtragan ghoshit kiya gaya he
 At the time of the partition of Bengal, both Hindus and Muslims sang it, not the first two verses

 sahasron kanthon ne samavet swar main ise doharaaya to puraa aasmaan vande maataram ke ghosh se gunj uthaa
 In this way, Vande Mataram and Indian freedom struggle suddenly got its march
 aravind ghosh ne is avasar kaa bada romaanchak chitra khinchaa he
 In 1906, the British government banned Vande Mataram from singing at any session, procession or public place
 prasiddh netaa surendranath banerjee or amrit bazaar patrika ke sampadak motilal ghosh ne barisal main ekatra hue yuva congress adhiveshan ke pratinidhiyon se charchaa kii
 In defiance of the restrictive orders of the British Government on 14 April 1906, an entire procession was taken out with the badge of Vande Mataram and the police charged fiercely with sticks and attacked these Diwans of Vande Mataram
 motilal ghosh or surendra nath banerjee jaise log rakt rajit hokar sadako par gir pade, unke saath saikadon logon ne police kii laathiyaan khai or laathiyaan khate khate vande maataram kaa ghosh karte rahe
 
 agle din adhiveshan phir vande maataram geet se shuru hua
 On 6 August 1906, Arvind came to Calcutta and started an English daily called Vande Mataram

 But Noorani is not the only one whose words like Devi or Mata are also communal, on 13 March 2003, Karnataka's then Minister of State for Primary and Secondary Education, BK Chandrasekhar, with the word 'prakriti', 'to place Goddess', Hindu and Had objected to the speech of a member by considering it Samadik
 tab us aahat sadsy ne poocha tha ki kya ‘bharat mata, ‘kannada bhubaneshwari or ‘kannada ambe jaise shabd bhi samdayik or hindu hai? In 1905, Gandhiji wrote - Today, millions of people gather for one thing and sing Vande Mataram
 mere vichaar se isane hamaare rashtriya geet kaa darja hasil kar liya he
 i feel this sacred, devotional and emotional song
 kai anya raashtragiton ke vipareet yah kisi anya raashtra-rajya kii nakaaratmakataaon ke bare main shor-sharaaba nah karata
 In 1936, Gandhiji wrote - "the many meaningful adjectives that the poet has used for our motherland are very favorable, they have no harm
" ab hamaari jimmedaari he ki ham in visheshnon ko yatharth main badalen
 Whatever be its source, however and whenever it was created, it was the most powerful battlefield of Hindus and Muslims during the partition of Bengal
 ek bachche ke rup main jab mujhe aanandamath ke bare main kuch nahin maaloom tha or na iske amar lekhak bankim ke bare main, tab bhi vande maataram mere hryday par chaa gaya

 Madam Cama began the speech to hoist the resolution on India's independence, unfurling the first national flag of modern India

 From 1906 the song became the voice of unity of Indians
 mantra kii visheshta hoti he- uski akhandta yani integrity
 Mantra creates emotion in its entirety just by listening
 jab This Vande Mataram song was sung in full from 1906 to 1911, this mantra had the power that the partition of Bengal had to be withdrawn by the British rule, but, until 1947, when the so-called 'political consensus' was reached on the disbanding of this mantra
 India too became so weak that it could not stop its rebuttal
 If the pieces of this song were chanted earlier, it resulted in the division of the country
 madanlaal dhingra, phull chaaki, khudiram bose, suryasen, ramprasad bismil or anya bahut se krantikariyon ne vande maataram kahi kar fasi ke fande ko choomaa
 Bhagat Singh used to write a letter to his father greeting him with Vande Mataram
 subhaashachan bose kii aaazaad hind fouj ne is geet ko angikaar kiya or singapore radio stesan se iskaa saaran hota tha
 In 1938, Nehruji himself wrote- 'for more than thirty years this song has been directly associated with Indian nationalism
 ‘aise jan geet tailor maid nahin hote or na hi ve logon ke dimag par thope ja sakate hai
 They themselves achieve their heights

 Fuzzy logic is a type of multi-value argument in which the true values of the variables can be anything between 0 and 1
 iskaa upyog 'aanshik satya' kii avadharana ke anuroop he kyonki praayah ham jivan main pate hai ki koi tark na purnatah 'satya' hota he na purnatah 'asaty'
 In contrast, the values of variables in boolean logic are either 0 or 1
 digital paripath booleey tark par hi kaam karte hai
 The term 'fuzzy logic' was first used by Lotfi Jadeh in 1965 with the rendering of the obscure set-theory
 kintu aspasht tark kaa adhyayan 1920 ke dashak ke samay se hi chal rahaa tha jisko anant-maan tark kehete the
 Fuzzy logic is used efficiently in many fields with some key areas - control theory, artificial intelligence, etc
 truth or probabiletis kii donon digriyon kaa range 0 or 1 ke bich hota he or isliye shuru-shuru main ye ek jaise lag sakate hai
 However, ideologically they differ; Truth represents membership in an ambiguously defined set that is not the liquidity of an event or condition, like probability theory
 udhaaharan ke liye, 100 ml kaa ek gilaas lete hai jisamen 30 ml jal he
 Then we can consider two concepts: Empty and Full
 inamen se prayek ke arth ko ek nishchit fazi set ke dwaara pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Only then one can define this glass as 0

 The second designer will also design a set membership work equally well where the glass will be considered filled for all values below 50 ml
 It is important to understand that fuzzy logic uses the Truth degrees as a mathematical model of the velocity phenomenon while probability is a mathematical model of randomness
 ek probabilistic setting sabase pehle gilaas ke puraa bharaa hone ke liye ek scaler veriable ko paribhaashit karegaa or phir probability kaa varnan karte hue condishnal distributions ko paribhaashit karegaa jise koi vyakti ek vishisht purnataa ke str ko darshaakar gilaas ko bharaa hua kahegaa
 haalanki, kuch ghatana ke ghatit hone kii sweekruti ke bina is model kaa koi arth nahin he, udhaaharan ke liye, kuch minute ke baad, gilaas aadha khaali ho jayega
 dhyaan den ki condishning ko ek spacific obzarwar ko rakhkar praapt kiya ja saktaa he jo gilaas ke liye str or niyatatmak paryvekshakon ke ek vitaran yaa donon kaa aniyamit rup se chayan karata he
 As a result, probability has nothing but fuzziness, these are just different concepts that look similar from the outside because they use the same interval of real numbers
 de morgan ke prameya main dohari prayojyata or aniyamit veriables ke gun hai
 Nevertheless, since such theorems correspond to the properties of binary logic states, one can see where confusion can occur
 ek basic anuprayog, ek satat parivartaneey ke up-shreniyon ko parilakshyit kar saktaa he
 For example, measurement of the temperature of anti-lock brakes may include functions with several different memberships defining particular temperature ranges that are necessary to control brakes well
 prayek function, ek truth vailu ke usee taapmaana vailu ko chitrit karata he jiskaa range 0 se 1 ke bich hota he
 These truth values can then be used to determine ways of controlling the brakes

 Fuzzy set theory defines fuzzy operators on fuzzy sets
 iske anuprayog main yahi samasya he ki upyukt fazi prachaalak gyaat nahin ho saktaa he
 For this reason, fuzzy logic typically uses or structures IF-THEN rules, such as fuzzy associative matrices
 niyamon ko aam taur par nimna rup se vyakt kiya jaataa he: IF veriable IS property THEN ection For example, a simple temperature regulator that uses a fan can look like this: yadi taapmaana bahut sheethal he to pankhe ko roak den yadi taapmaana sheethal he to pankhe ko dhimaa kar den yadi taapmaana saamaanya he to is str ko banaae rakhen yadi taapmaana garm he to pankhe kii gati badha den There is no "ELSE" - all rules are evaluated because temperatures can be "cold" and "normal" in different degrees at the same time
 boolian logic ke AND, OR tathaa NOT prachaalak, fazi logic main maujuud hote hai jinhen aam taur par minimum, maximum or complement ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he; jab unhen is tarah se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he tab unhen zaadeh prachaalak kaha jaataa he
 Hence for fuzzy variables x and y: NOT x = ) x AND y = minimum, truth)x OR y = maximum, truth) There are other operators who are linguistic in nature and are called hedges and can also be applied
 ye aam taur par edwarbs hote hai, jaise - "veri" yaa "samawhat", jo ek ganitiya sutara kaa prayog karke set ke arth ko sanshodhit kar dete hai
 In the application, the programming language prolog is well equipped to implement fuzzy logic along with its facilities to establish a database of "rules" that are asked to reduce logic

 Once fuzzy relations are defined, it becomes possible to develop a fuzzy relational database

 ganitiya logic main, "fazi logic" ke kai aupchaarik systams hai; unamem se adhikansh tathakthith tii-norm fazi logics se sambandhit hai
 The most important propositional fuzzy logics are: ye uparokt-ullikhit fazi logic main universal or exystential quantifiers ko thik usee prakaar se yoga karke iskaa vistaar karte hai jis prakaar se proposishnal logic se predicket logic nirmit hota he
 The semantics of universal quantifiers in T-normal fuzzy logics are inferences of the Truth degrees of examples of quantified sub-formula

 viraam shabd vi + ram + ghan se bana he or iskaa mul arth he "tehraav", "aaraam" aadi ke liye
 The common signs, which divide the sentence into different parts for clarity of meaning, are called "breaks" in grammar or composition
 "viraam" kaa thik angreji samanaarthi "stop" he, kintu prayog main is arth main "panktuation" shabd miltaa he
 "punctuation" refers to the word Latin, meaning "point"
 is prakaar "panktuation" kaa yatharth arth bindu rakhana" yaa "vaakya main bindu rakhana" he
 Often people understand that the use of the word "break" in this sense is modern and it is a translation of the word "punctuation"
 kintu tatvat: aisi baat nahin he
 Long before Panini, the use of the word 'break' in the texts and teachings is found in similar meanings
 taittareey praatishakhya main chaar prakaar kaa viraam mana gaya he : That is, Rigviram, Padaviram, Vivrutiviram, Equivocalism, and the amounts of these breaks are considered to be three, two, one and half respectively
 inamen rugviram charan yaa chand ke ant ke liye arthath aaj ke purna viraam jaisaa he
 "rik" means verses, hence this break is called "rigviram"
 iske liye praaia: ek yaa do khadi pai dene kii parampara rahi he
 Sometimes they have also made small trees or flowers
 "padviram" do shabdon yaa padon ke bich main aata he
 Interrupts posts
 padon ke bich main hone ke kaaran hi iskaa naam "padviram" he
 There is virtually no punctuation between posts
 iskaa aashay maatr yah he saamaanya bhashaa main padon ke bich viraam athwa dhwani kaa abhaav hota he or use lagbhag do maatra hona chahie
 The third break also comes in between words or terms, but they are special words or terms
 kabhi kabhi sanskrit main aisa hota he ki shabd ke ant main swar aata he or uske badwaale shabd ke pranrabh main bhi swar
 In such a situation, a pact is usually done
 kintu jab inke bich sandhi nahin hoti, to in donon shabdon ke bich kaa viraam anya prakaar ke saamaanya shabdon yaa padon ke bich ke viraam se aadha arthath keval ek maatra kaa hota he
 This is the "paradox"
 "hari etu," "aho isha:" ke bich ke viraam isi varg ke hai
 "vivruti" is the technical name of the vowel vividness of the vowels: swarayorsandhi: - Taittiriya Pratishkath)
 isi aadhaar par is viraam ko is naam se abhihit kiya gaya he
 Four strains of discontinuation have also been performed: vivritiviraam ke ye bhed mandukki, naradiya tathaa yajyavlky shiksha aadi main milte hai
 It has been said above that the commutation is of a quantity, but the quantity of its four distinctions is not the same
 inamen pratham do kii maatra to ek-ek he, kintu tisare kii 3 / 4 maatra tathaa chauthe kii 1 / 4 maatra
 It is surprising to see this subtle study of Indian mystics
 yadi swar ukt prakaar se aaen to viraamkaal sachmuch hi kuch isi prakaar kaa hota he
 The first stop was Charananta or Chhandanta, the second and third were between the two terms
 chauthaa viraam shabd yaa pad ke bheetar kaa he
 Sometimes it happens that two vowels come close in the word, but they are not connected
 jis prakaar do padon ke bich swaron kii asandhi kaa naam "vivruti" he, usee prakaar ek hi pad main do swaron main asandhi kaa naam samaanpadavivritti he
 The breaks between such vowels are called homologous breaks
 aisi sthiti sanskrit main bahut kam aati thi, kintu phir bhi kuch udhaaharan to mil hi jate hai, jaise praugam, titad:
 The word "pause" also occurs in Panini
 yahan bhi viraam kaa arth lagbhag vahi he arthath "maun" yaa dhwani kaa abhaav
 The annunciator says "virativiram:" Viramyate anen iti wa viva:
 kashikaakaar ne uparyukt viraamon se aage badhkar bhi vichaar kiya he
 He says that there is a slight pause between every two sounds of the word, ie between every two consonants or larynges
 ise ve aadhi maatra ke baraabar maanate hai
 In today's terms half the volume can be considered equal to the melancholic tone or the heartless voice
 bharat main lekhan ke viraamchihnon kaa prayog kaaphi pracheen kaal se miltaa he

 Similarly in the earlier territorial Chalukya inscriptions "

 The systematic and regular use of punctuation in India increased with the promotion of the press after European contact
 europe main unaniyon tathaa romanon main iskaa prachaar tha
 In his "ars Gramatica", the famous writer Donatus has given the high point for "cama", the midpoint for the colon and the low point for the full stop
 dhire-dhire isse vartmaan chinhon kaa vikaas hua
 Its multiple forms are found in the medieval period
 europe main 16veen sadi se viraam kaa niyamit prayog milane lagata he
 Initially, there was a lot of opposition as well
 da anuzio apane ko "kama" kaa shatru kaha karata tha
 Bartoli protested, saying that punctuation marks in printed books are like patches that knock the reader a lot
 kintu is prakaar ke virodhon ke baavjood apni upyogita ke kaaran viramchinhon kaa prayog badhata hi gaya or ab ve lekhan evam mudran ke aavashyak ang ban gaye hai
 Khadi pai or full stop in Hindi is of Indian tradition, whose ancient name was "dand"
 shesh chinh angreji ke madhyam se europe se aae hai
 Most punctuation is basically point-based
 likhte samay rukne par kalam kaagaj par rakhane se bindu sahaj hi ban jaataa tha
 Thus, the point of English etc
 as a complete stop easily became a sign of full stop
 kama, purna viraam yaa bindu main hi neeche kii ore ek shosha badha dene se bana he
 Interrogative or surprising signs have evolved independently
 isaki utpatti ke bare main matbhed he
 The question mark appears to be a shortened form of the Latin questioner Quaestio, with u at the bottom and o
