 There is some evidence that global warming may cause carbon loss from terrestrial ecosystems, leading to increased predictions of atmospheric CO2 levels
 Many climate models have had such temperatures through the 21st century An indication of global warming can be accelerated by the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to an increase in all 11 models in this C4MIP
 The study found that a large fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will remain airborne if climate change is responsible
 From the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied from 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the model 50
 And the majority of ppm lying between 100
 High CO2 levels led to an additional climate temperature increase ranging between 0

 In 1818, the teenage Abraham Lincoln lives with his parents in Indiana, Nancy and Thomas, both of whom used to plant saplings in Jack Bart's fields
 vahiin par, linkan ko ek gulam bechnewali dwaara apane africa-america dost, wiliam janson kii pitayee dekh maamle main bich-bachaav karnaa padataa he
 Thus, Thomas is dismissed from the acts of his own son
 usee raat, linkan apane ghar par bart ko chori-chupe ghuskar, uski maa par jhapatate dekhtaa he
 Nancy falls ill almost the same day, soon after which she dies
 thomas nanhen linkan ko bataata he bart ne hi uski maa ko zehar diya he, lekin use yah bhi kasam dilwaai jaati he ki wo uski maut kaa badla lene kii himakat nahin karegaa
 Nine years later, after his father's death, the restless Lincoln breaks his oath of revenge, and attacks Bart while waiting in the dock, but Bart is a vampire that quickly overcomes him
 haalaanki, bart use maar daalata, linkan kii jaan ek or ajanabi henry sterges bachaa letaa he
 In the morning, his unconscious opens at Henry's house, and where Sturges reveals vampires want to create a new world of their existence in this century, and in return he invites Lincoln to become a vampire hunter

 During this, Lincoln finds Barthes and kills him until he finds out about Mary
 marane se pehle, barts ek rahasy sterges ke pishaach hone kaa bare main bataata he
 Lincoln soon confronts Sturges, explaining why he became a vampire, that Adam and his wife were attacked and bitten by Adam a century ago
 chunki henry kii bivi kii ruh saaf thi, so is dansh ne uski jaan le lee, lekin sterges kii aatma patit hone ke kaaran vah pishaach ban gaya or adam or duusare pishaach ko nuksaan naa pahunchaa paane kii vajah bataai
 
 sturges ab isi tarah pishaach shikari ke gur sikhta he, is aashaa se ki vah adam ko tabah kar daalega
 After this disappointment, Lincoln makes up his mind to leave the campaign
 iske baavjood, adam apni gatividhiyaan jari rakhata he or janson ko aguva kar bagan taraf linkan ko fansane ke liye jaal bichhaata he
 Adam then captures Lincoln and tries to include him in his group, even conspiring to make the United Nations a dead nation
 speed apane doston ko bachaata he, or ve ohayo bhaag nikalate hai
 Lincoln then marries Mary and begins her political career as an electoral campaign to abolish slavery
 sturges yah aagaah linkan se karata he ki is gulaami kaarobaar kii bagdor unheen pishaach ke haathon hai, joki gulam un pishaachon kii khuraaq he, yadi linkan dakhlandji karata he, to pishaach iskaa badla jarur lenge
 Lincoln eventually becomes President of the United States after winning the election, settling in the White House with Mary and her son, William Wallace Lincoln

 At the same time, President Jefferson Davis assures Adam in this conspiracy that he will deploy vampires on the front
 linkan sabhi chaandi ke saamaanon ko jabt karaane kaa aadesh jari karata he taaki inhen pighalaakar hathiyaaron kaa rup de saken
 Speed is convinced that Lincoln will tear the nation apart this time, blaming it and taunting Adam that Lincoln is about to leave on a silver-laden train
 train par, adam or vadoma, apane gantavy par pahunchane se pehle raste main aag laga daalate hai, or linkan, sturges evam janson par dhaava bolte hai
 During the fight, Speed, before dying, tells Adam that there are only stones on the train
 linkan ye khulaasa karata he ki speed ne uske kehane par adam ko yahaan tak chaal main fansaane ke liye dhokhaa main rakhaa
 Lincoln kills Adam, trying to stop Adam with his silver watch, and escapes before the train is destroyed

 Realism, liberalism and constructivism are the three most popular theories in international relations

 antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhant main vyaakhyaatmak or rachanaatmak drushtikonon main bhed tab najar aata he jab ham antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhanton ko vargeekrut karte hai
 Interpretive theories are those that approach the outside world theoretically for theory formation
 rachanaatmak siddhant ve hai jo maanate hai ki siddhant vastav main duniya kaa nirmaan karne main madad karte hai
 Realism or political realism has been the dominant theory of international relations since the inception of the teaching of international relations
 yah siddhant un pracheen paramparaagat drushtikonon par bharosa karne kaa daawa karata he, jisamen thuseedide, maikiyaveli or hobs jaise lekhak shaamil hai
 Early realism can be expressed as a reaction against idealistic thinking
 yathartwaadiyon ne dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke prakope ko adarshavaadi soch kii kami ke ek saboot ke rup main dekha tha
 There are various varieties in modern realist thought, however, as the main principles of this theory state control, existence and self-help are considered
 yatharthwaad main kai mahatvapurn manyataayen hai
 Realists believe that nation-states are unitary and geographically based actors in this chaotic international system , where no real official world exists as a government capable of regulating interactions or interactions between these nation -states
 duusare, yah antarsarkari sanghathanon, antarrashtriya sanghathanon, gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, yaa bahurashtriya companiyon ke bajaay samprabhu rajyon ko hi antarrashtriya maamalon main praathmik abhinayta maanate hai
 Thus, the state itself, as the supreme system, remains in competition with each other
 aise main, ek rajya apane astitv ko banaae rakhane, apni khud kii suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye or in praathmik uddeshyon ke saath apane swayan ke swaarth kii khoj main ek tarksangat swytt abhinayta ke rup main kaary karata he or is tarah apni samprabhutaa or astitv kii raksha karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Realists believe that nation states, in pursuit of their own interests, attempt to mobilize resources for themselves and determine the relations between states by their respective levels of power
 shakti kaa yah str rajya ke sainya, aarthik or raajnneetik kshamtaaon se nirdhaarit hota he
 Human nature realists believe that states are inherently aggressive, so territorial expansion has been bounded by opposing powers
 jabaki dusre aakraamak / rakshaatmak yathartwaadeeyon kaa maananaa he ki rajya hamensha apane astitv kii suraksha or nirantarata kii chintaa se grast rahete hai
 The defensive approach leads to a security dilemma, because while a nation becomes a weapon to enhance its own security, the opponent also tries to gain parallel benefits as well
 isliye yah prakriya or adhik asthirataa kii ore le ja sakati he yahan suraksha ko keval shunya raashi khel / shunya-sanchay khel ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan keval saapeksh laabh mil saktaa he
 Neo-realism or structural realism was presented by Kenneth Waltz in his book The Theory of International Politics as an advanced development of realism itself
 joseph greeko ne navayathartwaadee vichaaron ko or adhik paramparaagat yathartwaadiyon ke saath joda he
 This type of theory is sometimes called "modern realism"
 waltz ke nav yatharthwaad kaa kahana he ki sanrachana ke prabhaav ko rajya ke vyavhaar ko samajhane ke rup main liya janaa chahie
 Structure is defined in two forms, first — the system theory of the international system, which is chaotic and second — the distribution of capacities in units
 waltz bhi paaramparik yatharthwaad ko chunauti detaa he jo kii paaramparik sainya shakti par jor detaa he bajaay rajya kii sanyukt kshamtaaon ke, jo kii pradarshnatmak shakti ke rup main hoti hai
 "idealism" was the precursor to liberal theories of international relations
 adarshavaad jo khud ko yathartwaadiyon kii aalochana ke rup main dekhtaa tha
 In international relations, idealism is an ideological approach that recognizes that a state should adopt it in its internal political philosophy to set its foreign policy goal
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek adarshavaadi yah vishwaas kar saktaa he ki ghar par garibi samaapt karne ke saath-saath videshon main bhi garibi se nipatane ke liye saath milakar kaam kiya janaa chahie
 Wilson's idealism was intended as a precursor to the principles of liberal international relations, which arose among the "'institution makers'" after World War II
 udaarvaad yah maanata he ki rajya kii kshamtaaon ke bajaay rajya kii praathamikataayen, rajya ke vyavhaar ke liye mukhya nirdharak hoti hai

 The main reason for the Mahabharata war was the high ambitions of the Kauravas and the infatuation of Dhritarashtra's son
 kaurav or pandav aapas main sahodar bhai the
 By Vedavas Ji, Pandit was born to Dhritarashtra and Ambalika from the womb of Bhartiya Ambika of Vichitravirya through Neog
 dhritarashtra ne gandhari ke garbh se sau putron ko janm diya, unamem duryodhana sabase bada tha
 Pandu had five sons like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva etc
 Dhritarashtra was blind since birth, so Pandu was ruled in his place, so that Dhritarashtra always had a grudge against Pandu and his sons
 yah dwesh duryodhana ke rup me faleebhoot hua or shakuni ne is aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya
 At Shakuni's behest, Duryodhana made many conspiracies from childhood to Lakshgriha
 parantu har baar wo vifal rahaa
 When Yudhishthira was made the crown prince when he was young, he tried to kill him by sending him to Lakshagriha, but the Pandavas escaped
 pandavon kii anupasthiti main dhritarashtra ne duryodhana ko yuvaraj bana diya parantu jab pandavon ne vaapis aakar apana rajya vaapis maanga to unhen rajya ke naam par khandahar rupi khandav van diya gaya
 At Dhritarashtra's request, Yudhishthira accepted this proposal to avoid the crisis of civil war
 pandavon ne shrikrishna kii sahaayta se indra kii amaravati puri jitani bhavy nagari indraprastha kaa nirmaan kiya
 The Pandavas collected abundant gems and money and performed the Rajasuya Yajna
 duryodhana pandavon kii unnati dekh nahin paaya or shakuni ke sahyog se dyut main chhal se yudhisthir se uskaa sara rajya jeet liya or kuru rajya sabha main draupadi ko nirvastr karne kaa prayaas kar use apamaanit kiya
 Probably the seeds of the war of Mahabharata had fallen on this day
 antatah punah dyut main harkar pandavon ko 12 varsho ko gyaatvaas or 1 varsh kaa agyatavaas sweekaar karnaa padaa
 But even after fulfilling this condition, the Kauravas refused to give the Pandavas their kingdom
 to pandavon ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa, parantu shrikrishna ne yuddh rokane kaa har sambhav prayaas karne kaa suzav diya
 Then Sri Krishna went to the Kurujya Sabha on behalf of the Pandavas as a peacemaker and there, Krishna offered Duryodhana to stop the war by giving only five villages to the Pandavas
 parantu jab duryodhana ne pandavon ko sui kii nonk jitani bhi bhoomi dene se manaa kar diya to antatah yudhisthir ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa
 In this way, the Kauravas collected 11 Akshauhini and the Pandavas collected 7 Akshauhini army
 yuddh kii taiyaariyaan purna karne ke baad kaurav or pandav donon dal kurukshetra pahunche, jahaan yah bhayankar yuddh ladaa gaya kurukshetra ke us bhayanak or ghamaasan sanhaarak yuddh kaa anumaan mahabharat ke bhishma parv main diye ek shloke se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki Bhrata bharatrantra swatriyaan ma matulah॥ 12 varshon ke gyaatvaas or 1 varsh ke agyatavaas kii shart puri karne par bhi jab kauravon ne pandavon ko unka rajya dene se manaa kar diya to pandavon ko yuddh karne ke liye baadhit hona padaa
 But Shri Krishna said that this war can cause destruction of the entire world civilization, so he suggested to make every effort to stop the war
 shrikrishna ne kaha ki duryodhana ko ek antim avasar avashya dena chahie, isaliye shrikrishna pandavon kii taraf se kururajya sabha main shantidoot banakar gayi or duryodhana se pandavon ke saamne keval paanch gaanv dekar yuddh taalane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 When Duryodhana refused to give the Pandavas as much land as the needle point, Sri Krishna explained to him that due to this persistence of Duryodhana, many innocent people along with his descendants and companions would have to sacrifice war
 is baat krodhit hokar duryodhana ne shrikrishna ko bandi banane kii koshish kii parantu shrikrishna maaya kaa prayog karke sabko apane viraat rup se bhaybheet kar vahaan se chale gayi
 After this Yudhishthira had to be forced to fight
 usee samay bhagwaan vedavyas ne dhritarashtra ke paas jaakar kaha ki tumhaare putron ne samast gurujanon kii baton kii avhelnaa karke antatah mahavinashkari yuddh ko khadaa hi kar diya
 On requesting to know the information of Dhritarashtra war, Ved Vyas told him that if you want to see this great war, then i can give you divine vision
 is par dhritarashtra ne kaha ki isamen mere hi kul kaa vinaash hona he, isaliye main is yuddh apni aankhon se nahin dekhuungaa
 So please make such a arrangement that i keep getting news of this war
 yah sunakar vedavyas ji ne sanjay ko bulaakar use divya drushti de di or kaha, “he dhritarashtra! maine sanjay ko divya drushti pradaan kar diya he
 There will be no such thing in the entire war zone which is hidden from it
 yah tumhen is mahayuddh kaa sara vrittant sunaayegaa
 After saying this, Ved Vyas went away
 jab yah nishchit ho gaya ki yuddh to hoga hi, to donon pakshon ne yuddh ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar deen
 Duryodhana was preparing for war for the last 13 years, he got education of mace war from Balram ji and with hard work and practice, he became better than Bhima in fighting mace war

 Vande Mataram was second in the top 10 songs in the poll
 yadi bangla bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaay to iskaa sheershak "bande maataram" hona chaiye "vande maataram" nahin
 Since the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bengali script and since there is no other letter in Bengali script, it was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay under the title Bande Mataram
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sheershak 'bande maataram' hona chaiye tha
 But there is no meaning of 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and "vande Mataram" pronunciation means "I pray to Mother", so writing and reading Vande Mataram in Devanagari script would be expedient

 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song "vande Mataram", because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In view of these objections, in 1937, the Congress took a deep view on this dispute

 He says that in this, Muslims have been described as foreign and traitorous
 vande maataram gane par bhi vivaad kiya ja rahaa he
 The first two stops of this song, which are relevant, do not contain any anti-muslim talk and do not worship any goddess or Durga
 par in logon kaa kahana he ki- However, it is not the case that all Muslims of India object to this or that all Hindus insist on singing it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kuch saal pehle vikhyath sangeetkaar e0 aar0 rahamaan ne, jo khud ek musalmaan hai, vande maataram ko lekar ek sangeet elbum taiyaar kiya tha jo bahut lokapriy hua
 Most people believe that this dispute is political
