 The Indian National Congress, mostly known as the Congress, is one of the two major political parties in India, among which are the other Bharatiya Janata Party
 congress kii sthapana british raaj main 28 disambar 1885 main hui thi; iske sansthaapakon main e o hum, dada bhai nauroji or dinsha vaachaa shaamil the
 In the late 19th and early to mid-20th century, the Congress became a central partner in the Indian freedom struggle, with more than 1
5 crore members and more than 70 million participants, opposing British colonial rule
 1947 main aazaadee ke baad, congress bharat kii pramukh raajnneetik party ban gai
 Out of 16 general elections from independence to 2016, Congress has won an absolute majority in 6 and led the ruling coalition in 4; Hence, she was a part of the Central Government for a total of 49 years
 bharat main, congress ke saat pradhanmantri rah chuke hai; pehle jawaharlal nehru the or haal hi main manmohan singh the
 In the 2014 general election, the Congress held the worst general electoral performance ever and won only 44 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha
 tab se lekar ab tak congress kai vivaadon main ghiri hui he, congress dwaara bhartiya army kaa manobal giraane kaa desh main virodh kiya ja rahaa he 
 The history of the Indian National Congress goes through two different periods
 sthapana The Indian National Congress was established on 28 December 1885 at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College, Bombay, with an attendance of 72 delegates
 iske sansthaapak mahasachiv e o hum the jinhone kalkatte ke vyomesh chandra banerjee ko adhyaksh niyukt kiya tha
 In its early days Congress had a vision of an elite institution
 iske shuruaati sadsy mukhya rup se bombai or madras presidency se liye gayi the
 Swaraj's goal in Congress was first adopted by Bal Gangadhar Tilak
 praarambhik varsh In 1907, two parties were formed in the Congress - the hot party and the soft party
 garam dal kaa netritv bal gangadhar tilak, lala lajpat raay evam bipin chandra paal kar rahe the
 The soft team was led by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Ferozeshah Mehta and Dada Bhai Naoroji
 garam dal purna swaraj kii maang kar rahaa tha parantu naram dal british raaj main swashaasan chahta tha
 After the outbreak of the First World War, at the Lucknow meeting of 1916, the two parties reunited and the Home Rule Movement was started, under which the British Raj demanded an official position for India
 congress ek jan andolan ke rup main But with Gandhiji's arrival in India in 1915, there was a big change in the Congress

 Since the independence of India in 1947, the Indian National Congress has been one of the main political parties in India

 Currently his son Rahul Gandhi serves as the National President of Congress, Kapil Sibal, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh, Ahmed Patel, Rashid Alvi, Raj Babbar, Manish Tiwari are the senior leaders of the Congress
 bharat ke purv pradhanmantri dow manmohan singh bhi congress se taalluk rakhte hai
 Nehru / Shastri era indira yug Rajiv Gandhi and Rao era aadhunik yug The Congress is a civil nationalist party that follows a form of nationalism, which supports values such as freedom, tolerance, equality and individual rights
 congress ek party ne hokar ek vichaardhaara he From time to time, various leaders opposed the policies of the Congress and struggled to remove it

 That is why Lohia gave the slogan - "remove Congress, save the country
" " The 1967 general election saw a major change

 saamaanya jivan main, computer, internet tathaa chitthon par hindi main vartanee sambandhi anek galtiyaan dekhi jaati hai
 Inaccurate spelling spoils the beauty of the language
 isaliye is lekh main hindi main kii jane vaali saamaanya galatiyon ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 These are inaccuracies that usually occur during typing on computers or other computing devices
 angreji main is prakaar kii ashuddhiyon ko typo kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes the typist does not get attention on them, even when meditating many times he ignores laziness
 ek anya kaaran yah bhi he ki kai baar tipakarta ko prayog kiye ja rahe typing aujaar dwaara vah varna yaa chihn tip karne kaa tarika pataa nahin hota
 This is due to convenience, because of not knowing the right way to type a symbol or due to lack of accessibility to type a particular mark
 computer par tankan ke samay adhiktar log aalasyavash yaa varna ko tip karne kaa tarika na jaanane / sulabh na hone ke kaaran purnaviram ke sthaan par phulstop kaa prayog karte hai
 Using fullstop in place of full stop also affects the beauty of Devanagari and other complications in computing
 hindi main kisi bhi viraam chihn yatha purnaviram, prashnchihn aadi se pehle spes nahin aata
 Nowadays, due to this happening in many printed books, magazines, people start typing the same which is wrong
 kisi bhi viraam chihn se pehle spes nahin aana chaiye
 In English, fullstop is used for compression, in Hindi it is the shortest sign
 praayah yah chihn keyboard par sulabh na hone se log iske sthaan par phulstop kaa hi prayog kar lete hai jabaki vah ashuddh he
 The simplest way to type this symbol is to type its Unicode code 0970 in any word processor and select it and press alt-x, it will be converted to the shortest symbol
 udhaaharan: sahi - dow rajendra prasad, galat - dow rajendra prasad, sahi - ium e, galat - ium
 e
 Due to its resemblance to the Hindi zero mark, many times people mistakenly use the zero digit of Hindi instead of the shortest sign
 inamen antar ye he ki ek to laghav chihn shunya se chota hota he doosraa shunya jahaan kshaitij rup se pankti ke madhya main hota he, laghav chihn kshaitij rup se neeche kii taraf hota he
 Many people, in the lack of information, put two full-lengths in place of the right sign of a double stick written in Sanskrit at the end of shlokas
 sahi chihn daalane hetu yadi aapke typing aujaar main ye chihn na ho to kisi bhi verde prosesar main iske unicode code 0965 ko tip karen tathaa use salact karke alt-x dabaa den, vah dabl dand chihn main badal jaayegaa
 a full stop / sentence is prescribed for sentence-end
 paragraph-ant hetu dabl-dand nirdhaarit he, jiskaa saamanyata kavita / padya main tukbandi ke ant main, kintu prayek paragraph ke ant main dabl dand tip kiya jaae to paath adhik vaigyanik or takneekee rup se parishuddh hoga
 Many times the typers type a colon corresponding to it instead of an immersion, which is completely impure
 maanak hindi keyboard inascript main visarg shift ke saath - kunji dabaakar praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 As an alternative, type its Unicode code 0903 in any word processor and select it and press alt-x, it will be converted into an immersion symbol
 kai baar tipakarta dashamalav chihn ke sthaan par usase milte julate chihn phulstop ko tip kar dete hai jo ki sarvatha ashuddh he
 If you want to see the difference between these two, then type both in a word processor and make the font size much larger
 dashamalav chihn ke liye Middle Dot kaa prayog kiya janaa chahie jo Numerical Keypad main Del key ke upar he
 Whereas only code is set for Full stop
 panchamaaksharon ke niyam kaa sahi gyaan na hone se bahudhaa log inke aadhe aksharon kii jagah aksar 'n' kaa hi galat prayog karte hai jaise 'pandit' ke sthaan par 'pandit', 'vindos' ke sthaan par 'vindos', 'chanchal' ke sthaan par 'chanchal' aadi
 Most of these impurities are used in place of 'n' and 'n' instead of 'n'
 niyam: varnmaala ke har vyanjan varg ke pehle chaar varnon ke pehle yadi anuswaar kii dhwani ho to us varg kaa paanchava varna aadha hokar lagata he
 That is, half से before the first four letters of the class, half चार before the first four letters of the class, half से before the first four letters of the class, half before the first four letters of the class and half before the first four characters of the class Comes
 udhaaharan: In modern Hindi, only Anusvara is also used for convenience in place of Panchamakshars, although it reduces the beauty of Devanagari
 jaise: pankaj - pankaj, shaanti - shanti, parampara - parampara
 The usage of j and N, in particular, has reduced considerably
 vikipedia kii parampara ke anusaar sanskrit, dharm tathaa bhartiya samskruti sambandhi lekhon main panchamaaksharon kaa prayog hona chaiye jabaki vigyaan, ganit, takanic aadi sambandhi lekhon main saralata hetu aadhunik hindi kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Yes, the title of the article should be kept in the alphabet in terms of pure pronunciation and spelling, irrespective of any subject
 khoj tathaa punarnirdesan hetu aadhunik vartanee vaale naam ko parmparik panchamakshar vaale sheershak par punarnirdeshit kar dena chaiye taaki shuddh uccharan evam vartanee rahe
 For example, the priest should be redirected to the priest
 aagat dhwani "o" athwa isaki maatra ke baad shuddh vartanee kaa prayog hi upyukt he kyonki usamen anuswaar kii bindi dikhaayi nahin detii
 Example - Font is appropriate instead of font
 isi prakaar duusari aagat dhwani "ji" tathaa isaki maatra ke baad bhi anuswaar kii bindi yaa to dikhti nahin yaa chandrabindu kaa bhram hota he atah iske sthaan par bhi shuddh vartanee kaa prayog hi upyukt he
 Example - And is suitable for place of place
 pancham varna kii sandhi se banane vaale sanyuktakshron main baad vaala varna "ji" tathaa "na" ke neeche lagata he
 In this way, most of the Unicode fonts cannot be shown correctly to the conjuncts, which are shown on the left
 sanskrit 2003 naamak unicode font aise sanyuktakshron ko sahi prakaar se pradarshit karata he
 Example - The correct form of Ganga
 lekhan kii galati:'o' tathaa 'ji' ye donon aagat dhvaniyaan kahi jaati hai jo ki hindi main videshi bhashaaon visheshkar angreji se aayi hai
 They are used for two distinct sounds of English
 'o' kii dhwani 'o' tathaa 'ou' ke lagbhag bich kii he, udhaaharan: bos, hot aadi
 Often people write 'sha' instead of 'sha' in general writing and also in computer typing
 aisa do kaarnon se he ek to videshi dhvaniyaan hone se bhartiya kai baar inhen aatmsaat nahin kar pate or doosraa computer par typing aujaar main 'o' kaa chihn sulabh na hone se
 Many a times, people become idle even when they are accessible in typing tools
 haalaanki kuch shabd aise hai jinke hindi main 'aa' vaale rup bhi prachlit hai jaise doctor tathaa kalege 
 In these cases the form of 'aa' also goes on, because their pronunciation of 'aa' is also prevalent, although it is better to write 'a'
 lekin jin shabdon ke uccharan main keval 'o' kii hi dhwani ho unhen 'aa' rup main likhnaa bilkul galat he
 For example, 'blog' is often incorrectly written as 'blog' on the internet, although no one speaks 'blog'
 uccharan kii galati:chunki 'o' videshi dhwani he isaliye kai bhartiya ise aatmsaat nahin kar pate tathaa 'o' vaale shabdon kaa uccharan 'aa' kii tarah karte hai
 For example, 'all' in place of 'all', 'allso' in place of 'allso', 'body' in place of 'body' etc
 aagat dhwani 'ji', 'e' tathaa 'i' ke lagbhag bich kii he, udhaaharan 'jak', 'mak' 
 In Hindi, for this, the nearest letter 'A' is used, like 'jack' instead of 'jack'
 yah itnaa ashuddh nahin lekin 'ji' kii maatra ke sthaan par 'e' kii maatra kaa upyog sarvatha anuchit he tathaa devanagari kii dhvanyaatmakataa gun - uccharan or lekhan kii samarupatha ke viruddh he
 Examples of such misuse are to write 'raid' instead of 'raid' which is Raid's correct writing
 isi prakaar 'test' ke sthaan par 'test' likhnaa jo ki Taste kaa sahi lekhan he, 'gust' ke sthaan par 'guest' jo ki galat he
 Another inaccuracy that is seen in the print media - instead of 'ऍ', the letter 'A' is placed above 'A'
 aisa varna unicode font main bananaa sambhav nahin he lekin non-unicode font main ban jaataa he
 Such a mistake is usually reflected in characters starting with 'ऍ'
 bahudhaa anuswaar ke sthaan par anunasik tathaa anunasik ke sthaan par anuswaar likh diya jaataa he
 In particular, the mistake of writing Anusvara in place of Anunasik is more prevalent and it has also received an unannounced acceptance
 kuch udhaaharan hai, hansanaa ke sthaan par hansnaa, pankh ke sthaan par pankh aadi
 To illustrate the difference between these two, the example of swan and laughter is often given
 anuswaar tathaa anunasik ke upyog sambandhi jaankaree yahan dekhen
 Nukta is used in words taken from Urdu to Hindi
 iske atirikt angreji aadi videshi bhashaaon ke kuch shabdon main bhi nukte kaa upyog hota he
 Nukta reveals the correct sound of a particular language, but when writing in Hindi, many times people omit Nukta
 yadhyapi ise gambheer galati nahin mana jaataa
 Special notice is not given to leave nukta but it seems strange to place it where nukta is not done, like 'fruit' instead of 'fruit' and 'fir' instead of 'fir' is completely wrong
 bevajaah nukta lagane kaa ek kaaran typing sambandhi bhi he
 For example, while typing with a tool called Barah Aimai, pressing 'F' key prints 'F' while 'F' requires pressing 'P + H'
 isaliye kai log aalasyavash 'F' dwaara 'pha' likhane ko hi aadat bana lete hai
 Nukta can also be unavoidable at times
 ek udhaaharan dekhen: angreji ke varna 'G' kaa uccharan he 'ji', tathaa 'Z' kaa uccharan he 'zee'
 The difference between the pronunciation of these two cannot be clear without the nukes
 ek anya suzav yah diya jaataa he ki jahaan arth badalane kii ashanka ho, vahiin nukta jaise veikshiptikaarak kaa prayog kiya jaae
 Where the meaning of the tip can be understood correctly, the work should be done without the tip
 nukte ke bare main ek saamaanya niyam yaad rakhaa janaa chaiye - haan par nukte ke prayog ke vishay main shankaa ho, vahaan nukte kaa prayog na karen
 'necessity' will go in place of 'need', but not 'compulsion' in place of 'compulsion'
 nukte ke sahi prayog hetu yah lekh dekhen
 There are many words in Hindi whose spelling is usually misspelled
 ye vartaniyaan print media main maujuud hone se aam aadmi inhen hi sahi samajhane lagata he
 The main article above lists such words
 k --> kai, kha --> khi aadi Many people also pronounce 'sh' and 'sh' like 's', like saying 'english' to 'english', 'conspiracy' to 'sadhyantra' etc
 'ri' kaa uttar bharat main uccharan 'ri' kii tarah tathaa dakshin bharat main 'ru' kii tarah hota he
 Its correct pronunciation is lost in chronology
 'jna' kaa bharat ke vibhinn hisson main uccharan bhinn-bhinn tareeke se hota he, uttar bharat ke hindi bhashaa kshetron main praayah iskaa uccharan 'gy' kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 Its correct pronunciation has also disappeared
 aajkal 'ksha' kaa uccharan 'chha' kii tarah aam taur par sunne ko miltaa he jaise 'kshatriya' ko 'chhatriy' bolnaa
 Often people unfamiliar with Panchamakshar pronounce 'ङ' as' ''
 kuch log kuch shabdon main aane vaale aadhe aksharon kaa puure aksharon kii tarah uccharan karte hai
 For example, the pronunciation of 'question' is like 'question', 'importance' is pronounced like 'mahtava', 'attempt' is pronounced as 'effort'
 kai aise shabd hai jinka arth to kuch or tha lekin ve galat arth samajhe jane se bhinn arth main prayukt hone lage hai
 For example, khilafat means "the office of the caliphate and its authority", but the general public, including educated journalists, is using Khilafat in the same sense as a proclamation

 The composition which makes the sensation in the heart of the audience not only by hearing but also by sight, is called drama or visual poetry
 naatak main shravy kavy se adhik romaniyata hoti he
 Being audible, it is more closely related to folk consciousness
 naatyashaastra main lok chetana ko naatak ke lekhan or manchan kii mul prerana mana gaya he
 The play is counted in poems
 kavy do prakaar ke maane gayi hai— shravy or drishy
 a distinction of this visual poetry has been considered drama
 par drushti dwaara mukhya rup se iskaa grahan hone ke kaaran drishy kavy maatr ko naatak kehane lage hai
 The Natyashastra of Bharatamuni is the most ancient book on this subject
 agnipurana main bhi naatak ke lakshan aadi kaa nirupan he
 In it, the name of one type of poetry is called Prakarna
 is prakeern ke do bhed he— kavy or abhinaeya
 The Agnipuran states 27 distinctions of visual poetry or metaphor
 sahityadarpan main naatak ke lakshan, bhed aadi adhik spasht rup se die hai
 It has been written above that a distinction of visual poetry is called drama
 drishy kavy ke mukhya do vibhaag hai— roopak or uparupak
 There are ten distinctions of metaphor - metaphor, drama, episode, speech, vyayoga, samvakara, dhim, ehamraig, ankavithi, and farce
 'uparupak' ke atharah bhed hai— naatika, trotak, goshtee, sattak, natayaraasak, prasthaan, ullapya, kavy, prekshna, raasak, sanlapak, srigadith, shinpak, vilasika, durmallika, prakaranika, hallisha or bhanika
 According to the above distinctions, the term drama speaks in the sense of visual poetry
 sahityadarpan ke anusaar naatak kisi khyath vrutt ' kii lekar likhaanaa chahie
 It should be full of many luxuries, pleasures, sorrows, and many juices
 usamen paanch se lekar das tak ank hone chahie
 The protagonist of the play must be a majestic man or Rajarshi of Dhirodatta and eminent dynasty
 naatak ke pradhan yaa angi ras shringaar or vir hai
 The remaining juices are secondary
 shanti, karunaa aadi jis rupak main main prathan ho vah naatak nahin kahala saktaa
 There must be an astonishing trade in the treaty
 upsanhaar main mangal hi dikhaaya janaa chahie
 The break drama is against the Sanskrit Alankar Shastra
 abhinay aarambh hone ke pehle jo kriya hoti he, use purvarang kehete hai
 After the puvarang, the chieftain nut or sutradhara, also known as the founder, comes and praises the gathering, then the nuts, nati sutradhars, etc
 have an interactive conversation in which the subject of the play being played, poet-lineage narration etc
 are covered
 naatak ke is ansh ko prastaavna kehete hai
 The chronicle with which the play is composed is called the object
 'vastu' do prakaar kii hoti he—aadhikarik vastu or praasangik vastu
 The one who is the main hero of all the chronicles is called 'adhikari'
 is adhikari ke sambandh main jo kuch varnan kiya jaataa he use 'aadhikarik vastu kehete hai; jaise, ramlila main ram kaa charitra
 For the benevolence of this officer or with reference to rasupati, whose description comes, it is called a relevant thing; Such as the character of Sugriva, etc
 'saamne laane' arthath drishy sanmukh upasthit karne ko abhinay kehete hai
 Therefore, the name of Avasthanuparupa or Swang is acting
 abhinay chaar prakaar kaa hota he— angik, vaachik, aharya or satvik
 The act that is done with the gesture of the organs is done with the help of words, what is done with the words of speech, what is done by making disguises, what is done by the vibrations of the food and emotions, by the vibrations, sweat, etc
 is called satvik
 naatak main beej, bindu, pataakaa, prakari or kaary in paanchon ke dwaara prayojan siddhi hoti he
 Whatever is said around the mouth and the first reason for success is called seed, as Yudhishthira's zeal for Bhima's anger in the epic drama is the seed because of Draupadi's capitation
 koi ek baat puri hone par duusare vaakya se uskaa sambandh na rahane par bhi usamen aise vaakya laana jinaki duusare vaakya ke saath asangati na ho 'bindu' he
 The description of a wider context in the middle is called pataka - such as Sugriva in Uttaracharita and Abhigyan - the characterization of clown in Shankutal
 ek desh vyapee charitravarnan ko prakari kehete hai
 Whatever is done for the success of the action initiated is called action; Like, Ravana slaughter in Ramlila
 kisi ek vishay kii charchaa ho rahi ho, isi bich main koi doosraa vishay upasthit hokar pehle vishay se mail main maaloom ho vahaan pataakaa sthaan hota he, jaise, ramcharit main ram sita se kah rahe hai—'he priye ! tumhaari koi baat mujhe asay nahin, yadi asay he to keval tumhaara virah, isi bich main pratihaari aakar kahata he : dev ! durmukh upasthit
 Here, with the word 'present', 'virah present' looks like this and a kind of miracle appears
 sanskrit sahitya main naatak sambandhi aise hi anek kaushalon kii udbhaavna kii gai he or anek prakaar ke vibhed dikhaae gaye hai
 Nowadays, the new plays which are written in the national languages, following all the rules of Sanskrit plays or inclusion of subjects is considered unnecessary
 bhaaratendu harishchandra likhte hai—'sanskrit naatak kii bhanti hindi naatak main unka anusandhan karnaa yaa kisi naatakang main inako ytnpurvak rakhkar naatak likhnaa vyarth he; kyonki pracheen lakshan rakhkar aadhunik naatakadi kii shobhaa sampadan karne se ulta fal hota he or ytn vyarth ho jaataa he
 Acting and theater in India was produced during the Vedic period itself
 tatpashchaat sanskrit rangamanch to apni unnati kii paraakaashtha par pahunch gaya tha-bharat muni kaa naatyashaastra iskaa pramaan he
 In very ancient times, Sanskrit dramas in India were no longer the language of religious occasions, cultural festivals, social ceremonies and state speech, so the staging of Sanskrit plays ended
 bharatvarsh main naatakon kaa prachaar bahut pracheen kaal se hai
 The drama of Bharata Muni is very old
 ramayana, mahabharat, harivansh ityadi main nat or naatak kaa ullekh he
 Panini has taken the names of two Natasutraks named ‘shilali’ and ‘krishashva’
 shilaali kaa naam shukla yajurvedic shatapath brahman or samavedic anupad sutara main miltaa hai
 According to astrology, scholars have told the Shatapatha Brahmin above 4000 years
 atah kuch paashchaatya vidwaanon kii yah raay haq greece yaa yunaan main hi sabase pehle naatak kaa pradurbhaav hua, thik nahin he
 It is written in Harivansh that when Pradyumna, Samb Adi Yadav went to Prince Vajranabha's purse, he played the Ram Janmabha and the Rambhabhisar plays there
 pehle unhone nepathy bandha tha jiske bheetar se striyon ne madhur swar se gaan kiya tha
 Yadav named Shur was made Ravan, a woman named Manvoti became Rambha, Pradyumna Nalakubar and Samb were made clowns
 wilson aadi paashchaatya vidwaanon ne spasht sweekaar kiya hai ki hinduon ne apane yahan naatak kaa pradurbhaav apane aap kiya tha
 The ancient Hindu kings used to build large colorants
 madhyapradesh main sarguja ek pahari sthaan he, vahaan ek gupha ke bheetar is prakaar kii ek rangashaala ke chihn paae gaye hai
 It is true that Sanskrit dramas are not available nowadays before the arrival of the Greeks, but their absence from this fact cannot be considered, given this much evidence
 sambhav he, kalasampann unani jati se jab hindu jati kaa milan hua ho tab jis prakaar kuch or or baaten ek ne duusare kii grahan kii
 Similarly, some things in relation to the drama must have been taken by Hindus
 bahyapati kaa 'jawanika' naam dekh kuch log yavan sansarg suchit karte hai
 From the 'visual' Sanskrit plays in the numerals, it is estimated that the pictures used to remain on these tracks
 astu adhik se adhik is vishay main yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki atyant pracheen kaal main jo abhinay hua karte the
 Paintings were not used in them
 sikandar ke aane ke peeche unka prachaar hua
 Even now Ramlila, Raslila are without screens
 madhyakaal main pradeshik bhashaaon main loktantr kaa udai hua
 It is a strange coincidence that in the Muslim period, where the religious fanatics of the rulers broke the literary tradition of India, there was a good spread of Lok Manch in the local languages
 raasalila, ramlila tathaa nautanki aadi ke rup main lokdharmee natyamanch bana rahaa
 In the Bhaktikal, on one hand, Krishna's Rasleela was widely practiced in Braj Bhasha and on the other, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, Ramlila started celebrating with great pomp in small towns across India
 saahitiyik drushti se is madhyakaal main kuch sanskrit naatakon ke padhyabaddh hindi chhayanuwaad bhi hue, jaise nevaaj krit ‘abhigyaan shaakuntal’, somnath krit ‘malti-madhav’, hridayramcharita ‘hanumannatak’ aadi; kuch moulik padhyabaddh sanvadatmak rachanaayen bhi huin, jaise lachhiraam krit ‘karunaabharan’, raghuram nagar krit ‘sabhasaar’, ganesh kavi krit ‘pradhyumnvijay’ aadi; par inamen naatakeey paddati kaa purnataya nirvaah nahin hua
 These can only be called interactive compositions
 is prakaar saahitiyik drushti tathaa saahitiyik rachanaaon ke abhaav ke kaaran madhyakaal main saahitiyik rangakarm kii ore koi pravriti nahin hui
 The truth is that before the rise of commercial and literary theater in the modern period, the folk theater of Ramlila, Nautanki etc
 kept the Hindi theater alive for four-five hundred years
 yah lokmanch-parampara aaj tak vibhinn roopon main samooche desh main vartmaan he
 Apart from Ramlila in North India, 'veer Abhimanyu', 'satya Harishchandra' etc
 dramas based on Mahabharata and 'roop-basant', 'heer-ranjha', 'haqikatarai', 'bilvamangal' etc
 are popular till date
 aadhunik kaal main angreji rajya kii sthapana ke saath rangamanch ko protsaahan mila
 As a result, commercial drama circles were established all over India
 natyarangan kii pravriti sarvapratham banglaa main dikhaai di
 Around 1835 AD, many unofficial theater in Calcutta were built
 kalakatta ke kuch sambhrant pariwaron or raison ne inke nirmaan main yoga diya tha or duusari ore vyavayayik naatak mandaliyon ke asaahitiyik prayaas se alag tha
 The study of this drama-creation of Bengali and the Natyarangan is important because the condition, direction and inspiration of Bharatendu Harishchandra's Rangandolan was derived from it
 banglaa ke is aarmabhik saahitiyik prayaas main jo naatak rache gaye ve mul sanskrit yaa angreji naatakon ke chhayanuwaad yaa roopaantar the
 It is clear that Bharatendu's initial effort was also in the shadow of Sanskrit plays
 hindi rangamanchi saahitiyik naatakon main sabase pehla hindi geetinaty amaanat krit ‘inder sabha’ kaha ja saktaa he jo san 1853 i
 main lakhanu ke nawab waajid alishaah ke darbar main khelaa gaya tha
 The Urdu-style experiment in it was similar to that adopted by Parsi drama circles in their plays
 san 1862 i
 main kaashi main ‘janaki mangal’ naamak vishuddh hindi naatak khelaa gaya tha
 The Parsi circles — Original Victoria, Empress Victoria, Elphinstone Theatrical Company, Alfred Theatrical and New Alfred Company, etc
 — went far beyond the above-mentioned efforts of the aforementioned literary theater
 sarvapratham bombai or baad main hyderabad, lakhanu, banaras, dilli lahore aadi kai kendron or sthanon se ye companiyaan desh-bhar main gum-ghumkar hindi naatakon kaa pradarshan karne lageen
 For these Parsi drama circles, writers like Nasrabani Khan Sahab, Raunak Banarsi, Vinayak Prasad 'talib', 'ahsan' etc
 first wrote plays
 janata kaa sasta manoranjan or dhanoparjan hi in companiyon kaa mukhya uddeshy tha
 That is why they did not have special purpose from high-quality literary plays
 dharmik-puranic tathaa prem-pradhan naatakon ko hi ye apane rangamanch par dikhaati thim
 He did not hesitate to perform cheap and vulgar
 isi se janata kii ruchi bhrasht karne kaa dosha in par lagaaya jaataa he
 Due to the excursion, the theater of these companies also used to roam with them
 kisi sthaayee rangamanch kii sthapana inke dwaara bhi sambhav nahin thi
 The structure of the theater was constructed by bullies and picture-bizarre curtains were hung on the stage
 bhadkeeli-chatakili veshbhusha, pardon kii nai-nai chitrakaari tathaa chamatkaarpurn drishy-vidhaan kii ore inkaa adhik dhyaan rahata tha
 The curtains were raised according to the scenery
 sangeet-vaadya kaa aayojan stage ke agle bhaag main hota tha
 The crass comical scenes were deliberately placed in between the scenes
 bich-bich main shaayari, gajalen or tukbandi khub chalati thi
 The language was a mixed form of urdu-hindi
 samvaad padya-rup tathaa tukpurna khub hote the
 There have also been some playwrights such as Radheshyam Kathachakak, Narayan Prasad Betab, Agahashr Kashmiri, Harikrishna Johar etc
 who have tried to improve the Parsi theater by giving it some literary elements and tried to bring Hindi to this commercial theater
 par vyavsaayik vritti ke kaaran sambhavat: is rangamanch par sudhaar sambhav nahin tha
 With this, these playwrights also had to become commercial
 is prakaar parsi rangamanch na viksit ho sakaa, na sthaayee hi ban sakaa
 Plays in Hindi are thought to begin with Bharatendu Harishchandra
 us kaal ke bharatendu tathaa unke samakaleen naatakakaron ne lok chetana ke vikaas ke liye naatakon kii rachana kii isliye us samay kii saamaajik samasyaon ko naatakon main abhivyakt hone kaa acha avasar mila
 As has been said, the creation of non-commercial literary theater in Hindi can be considered from the geographical metaphor called 'inder Sabha' of 'amanat' Lakhanvi
 par sach to yah he ki ‘inder sabha’ kii vastav main rangamanchi kriti nahin thi
 It used to have an open stage under the canopy
 nautanki kii tarah teen ore darshak baithte the, ek ore takht par raja inder kaa asana laga diya jaataa tha, saath main pariyon ke liye kursiyaan rakhi jaati thim
 a scarlet curtain was hung behind the decorations
 isi ke peeche se paatro kaa pravesh karaayaa jaataa tha
 King Inder, fairies etc
 characters once came and were present there
 ve apane samvaad bolkar waapas nahin jate the
 At that time, Natyarangan became so popular that many meetings were organized following the 'inder Sabha' of Amanat, such as 'madarilal's Inder Sabha', 'daryai Inder Sabha', 'hawaiian Inder Sabha' etc
 parsi naatak mandaliyon ne bhi in sabhaaon or majaliseparistaan ko apanaaya
 These compositions were not plays, nor did they form the theater of Hindi
 isi se bharatendu harishchandr inako 'naatakabhas' kehete the
 He wrote 'bandar Sabha' as his parody
 sanskrit naatakon kaa yug dhalane laga tab chaudaavin shatabdi se unnisvi shatabdi tak unka sthaan vibhinn bhartiya bhashaaon main lok naatakon ne liya
 Today, folk drama is known by different names in different regions
 ishopanishad shukla yajurvedic shakha ke antargat ek upanishad he
 This Upanishad occupies a very important place among the other Upanishads due to their little clan
 isamen koi katha-kahani nahin he keval aatm varnan he
 From the first verse of this Upanishad, "ishavasamidansarvayatkinch Jagatya-jagat 


" to the eighteenth verse "agne naye sapatha raye asman vidvani dev vayunani scholar 


", words like Brahman-description, worship, prayer etc
 are mentioned
 ek hi swar he — brahm kaa, gyaan kaa, aatm-gyaan kaa
 This Upanishad, having a wonderful art, is a talk of God being the creator of God, the owner of the entire universe is mentioned, it is said of the Satvik lifestyle that do not look at the wealth of others

 It has been said that those who do not recognize the self, their 'self', defy the soul, deny it and spend their whole life under this rejection, after death, they had to go to the same darkest world, that is, Asuriya
 That means you have to conceive, have to be born again
 is prakaar is upanishad main ek ore ishwar ko sarvanirmaataa maanakar swayan ko nimitt maatr banakar jivan jeene kaa ishaara karata he, jo duusari ore aatm ko na bhuulane kii ingit karata he
 After this comes the fact of representing the self that he is immovable as well as faster than the mind
 yah aatm sabhi indriyon se tej bhaagane vaala he
 In this Upanishad, Atma / Brahma is indicated by the name 'matrizva', which is to carry all activities, to support them
 ‘aatm’ ke brahm ke gunon ko bataane ke kram main yahan yah bataaya gaya he ki vah ek saath, ek hi samay main bhramanshil he, saath hi abhramanshil bhi
 It is near and far
 yahan use kai vishenshanon dwaara ingit kiya gaya he — ki vah sarvyaapee, ashariri, sarvajna, swajanma or man kaa shaasha he
 In this Upanishad, both Vidya and Avidya have been talked about, their different qualities have been told as well as worship of both Vidya and Avidya is forbidden - here it is clearly stated that both Vidya and Avidya are Those worshiping people fall into the dark darkness and worshiping the nature of realization is also forbidden here, but yes, knowledge and avidya are known together, avidya Conceiving the Rā, by observing the rituals, he overcomes the death, he conquers death and consumes the nectar
 The confession is here
 isamen sambhuti evam nashvan donon ko bhaleebhanti samaj kar avinashi tatv prapti evam amrit tatv ke upbhog kii baat kahi gai he
 In the last verses of this Upanishad, there are very beautiful verses - the matter of stitching the mouth of Brahma with a golden vessel and prayed to the nurturer of the sun
 suvarnapaatr se tanke hue us aatm ke mukh ko anaavruth kar diya jaae taaki upaask samaj sake, mahasoos kar sake kawh swayan hi brahmroop he or antim shlokon main kiye gaye sabhi karmon ko man ke dwaara yaad kiye jane kii baat aati he or agni se prarthana ki pankechabhautik sharir ke raakh main parivartit ho jane par vah use divya path se charam gantavy kii ore unmukh kar de

 There are two types of divorce mentioned in Islam
 pehla talaaq al sunnam, jise paighmbar mohammad ke hukum ke mutabiq kiya jaataa he
 While another, the divorce Al Biddat, which was later invented
 koran main sidhe taur par teen talaaq kaa koi zikr nahin he or naa hi paighmbar mohammad ne iske bare main sidhe taur par kuch kaha he
 In the Quran, divorce is mentioned only by divorcing once
 lekin isse pehle donon ke bich sulajh karaane ke liye bhi kai upaay bataae gaye hai
 The Suareh Nisa-35 states that; iske baad bhi agar shuhar or bivi donon alag hona chaahate hai to shuhar bivi ke khaas dinon ke aane kaa intazaar karegaa
 After a few days have passed, when the wife is gone, then at least two unaccounted people, without intervening, will give a divorce to the wife in front of them, that is, the husband says to each wife, "I divorce you
" 
 talaaq dene ke teen maheene baad tak bivi sasuraal main rah sakati he
 No one can remove it

kom Abul Muzaffar Muhiuddin Muhammad Aurangzeb Alamgir, commonly known as Aurangzeb or Alamgir, was the sixth Mughal ruler to rule India
 uskaa shashan 1658 se lekar 1707 main uski mrityu hone tak chalaa
 Aurangzeb ruled the Indian subcontinent for more than half a century
 wo akbar ke baad sabase zyada samay tak shashan karne vaala mogul shaasha tha
 During his lifetime he tried his best to expand the Mughal Empire in Southern India, but after his death, the Mughal Empire started shrinking
 aurangzeb ke shashan main mogul samrajya apane vistaar ke charmotkarsh par pahunchaa
 He was perhaps the wealthiest and sober person of his time, who through his conquests in South India, spread the Mughal Empire over twelve and a half million square miles and ruled over 150 million people, 1 / 4 of the world's population
 aurangzeb ne puure samrajya par fatwa-e-alamgiri lagu kiya or kuch samay ke liye gair-muslimon par atirikt kar bhi lagaaya
 He was the first Muslim ruler to apply Sharia to non-muslim people
 mogul shasankaal main unke shashan kaal main uske darbariyon main sabase zyada hindu the
 And Tegh Bahadur, the Guru of the Sikhs, along with Darashikoh, was given the death penalty in a crime of rebellion
 aurangzeb kaa janm 3 navambar 1618 ko dahod, gujarat main hua tha
 He was the sixth child of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal and the third son
 uske pita us samay gujarat ke soobedaar the
 When the rebellion by his father failed in June 1626, Aurangzeb and his brother Dara Shukoh were held hostage by Noor Jahan in the Lahore court of his grandfather Jahangir
 26 farvari 1628 ko jab shahjahan ko mogul samraat ghoshit kiya gaya tab aurangzeb agra kile main apane mata pita ke saath rahane ke liye waapas lautaa
 It was here that Aurangzeb received his formal education in Arabic and Persian
 mogul prathaon ke anusaar, shahjahan ne 1634 main shahzada aurangzeb ko dakkan kaa soobedaar niyukt kiya
 Aurangzeb went to Kirkee whose name was changed to Aurangabad
 1637 main usne rabia durrani se shaadi kii
 Here Shahjahan started handing over the work of the Mughal court to his son Dara Shikoh
 1644 main aurangzeb kii bahan ek durghatana main jalakar mar gai
 Aurangzeb came to Agra three weeks after the incident, which caused his father Shah Jahan immense anger
 usne aurangzeb ko dakkan ke soobedaar ke ohade se barkhaast kar diya
 Aurangzeb could not come to the court for 7 months
 baad main shahjahan ne use gujarat kaa soobedaar banaaya
 Aurangzeb ruled smoothly and received the title of the same, he was made the governor of Badakhshan and Balkh region
 iske baad use multan or sindh kaa bhi governor banaaya gaya
 During this time he kept fighting with the Persians of Persia for control over Kandahar, but if he got anything other than defeat, it was his father's neglect
 1652 main use dakkan kaa soobedaar fir se banaaya gaya
 He fought against Golconda and Bijapur and at the decisive moment Shah Jahan withdrew the army
 isse aurangzeb ko bahut thes pahaunchi kyonki shahjahan aisa uske bhai daara shikoh ke kehane par kar rahaa tha
 In 1652, Shah Jahan fell ill and it seemed that Shah Jahan would die
 daara shukoh, shah suja or aurangzeb main satta sangharsh chalane laga
 Shah Suza, who had declared himself as the Governor of Bengal, had to go to the Arakan region of Burma, and in 1659 Aurangzeb, after arresting Shah Jahan at the Taj Mahal for the royal treasury, declared himself king
 daara shikoh ko rajdroh ke zurm main phaansi de di gai
 Aurangzeb never spent the royal treasury on his own
 mogul, khaaskar akbar ke baad se, gair-muslimon par udaar rahe the lekin aurangzeb unke thik ulat tha
 Aurangzeb resumed Jiziya, which Akbar had finished
 usne kashmiri brahmanon ko islam qabool karne par majaboor kiya
 The Kashmiri Brahmins sought help from Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Guru of the Sikhs
 teg bahadur ne iskaa virodh kiya to aurangzeb ne unhen faansee par lataka diya
 Sikhs still remember this day in their festivals
 aurangzeb ke shashan kaal main yuddh-vidroh-daman-chadhaai ityadi kaa tantaa laga rahaa
 The number and strength of the Sikhs in the West was increasing
 dakshin main bijapur or golkunda ko antat usne haraa diya par is bich shivaji kii maratha sena ne unako naak main dam kar diya
 Shivaji was arrested by Aurangzeb, but when Shivaji and Sambhaji escaped, it became a matter of great concern for him
 aakhir shivaji maharaja ne aurangzeb ko haraaya or bharat main maratha ne puure desh main apni takat badhai shivaji kii mrityu ke baad bhi maraathon ne aurangzeb ko pareshaan kiya
 Meanwhile, the Rajputs turned against him due to the policy of converting Hindus to Islam and they revolted soon after he died in 1707
 aurangzeb ke prashasan main duusare mughal badshaah se zyada hindu niyukt the or shivaji bhi inamen shaamil the
 It is a well-known fact about Mughal history that in comparison to other kings, Aurangzeb's reign was more part of Hindu administration
 aitihaasik tathy bataate hai ki aurangzeb ke pita shahjahan ke shasankaal main sena ke vibhinn padon, darbar ke duusare ahm padon or vibhinn bhugolic prashasnic ikaayiyon main hinduon kii taadaad 24 fisadi thi jo aurangzeb ke samay main 33 fisadi tak ho gai thi
 In the words of m Athar Ali, this fact is the strongest evidence against the notion that the emperor sided with the Hindu mansabdars
 aurangzeb kii sena main varisht padon par badi sankhya main rajput niyukt the
 Aurangzeb's attack against the Marathas and the Sikhs is viewed through religious spectacles but it is ignored when concluding that the Mughal army was often commanded by a Rajput commander in the war zone
 itihaaskaar yadunath sarkaar likhte hai ki ek samay khud shivaji bhi aurangzeb kii sena main manasabadaar the
 It is said that he was supposed to be the head of the Mughal Sultanate in South India but failed to realize his military prowess, Aurangzeb did not approve this appointment
 aurangzeb pavitra jivan vyateet karata tha
 In his personal life he was an ideal man
 vah un sab durgunon se sarvatra mukt tha, jo asia ke raajaaon main samanytah the
 He lived the Yeti-life
 khaane-pine, vesh-bhusha or jivan kii anya sabhi-suvidhaon main vah sanyam baratata tha
 While busy with the heavy work of administration, he used to take time to earn some money by copying the Quran and sealing the caps to meet his needs
 aurangzeb hi nahin sabhi madhyakaalin bharat ke tamaam muslim baadshahon ke bare main ek baat yah bhi kahi jaati he ki unamem se koi bhartiya nahin tha
 At one level, this is childish and meaningless because the concept of nation did not exist anywhere in 17th century India
 haalanki iske baad bhi yah baat kam se kam aurangzeb ke maamle main lagu nahin hoti
 This Mughal emperor was a staunch upper-class Hindustani
 iskaa sidhaa tark yahi he ki uskaa janm gujarat ke dahod main hua tha or uskaa paalan poshan ucchwargeey hindustani pariwaron ke bacchon kii tarah hi hua
 The Braj language and its literature were always patronized throughout the Mughal period and this tradition continued even during the rule of Aurangzeb
 colombia uniwarsity se judi itihaaskaar ellison bush bataati hai ki aurangzeb ke darbar main braj ko protsaahan dene vaala maahaul tha
 The king's son Azam Shah had a keen interest in Braj poetry
 braj sahitya ke kuch bade naamon jaise mahakavi dev ko usne sangrakshan diya tha
 Vrind, another great poet of the same language, was also employed in Aurangzeb's administration
 mughalkaal main darbar kii aadhikarik lekhan bhashaa farsi thi lekin aurangzeb kaa shashan aane se pehle hi badshaah se lekar darbariyon tak ke bich prachlit bhashaa hindi-urdu ho chuki thi
 This can also be understood from Aurangzeb's letter he wrote to his 47-year-old son Azam Shah
 badshaah ne apane bete ko ek kila bhent kiya tha or is maukey par nagaade bajwane kaa aadesh diya
 In a letter to Azam Shah, Aurangzeb has written that when he was a child, he loved the voice of the drums and often said, 'babaji dhan-dhan!' It can be said from this example that Aurangzeb's son used to talk to his father in the then prevalent Hindi
 samraat aurangzeb ne islam dharm ke mahatv ko sweekaarte hue ‘quran’ ko apane shashan kaa aadhaar banaaya
 He prohibited kalma khudvana on coins, celebrating the festival of nauroz, cultivating hemp, singing and playing etc
 1663 i
 main sati pratha par pratibandh lagaaya
 Charged the pilgrimage tax again
 apane shashan kaal ke 11 varsh main ‘jharokha darshan’, 12wein varsh main ‘tuladaan pratha’ par pratibandh laga diya, 1668 i
 main hindu tyohaaron par pratibandh laga diya
 In 1699 AD, he ordered the destruction of Hindu temples
 bade-bade nagaron main aurangzeb dwaara ‘muhatsib’ ko niyukt kiya gaya
 In 1669, Aurangzeb broke the 'vishwanath Temple' of Benares and the 'keshav Rai Mandir' of Mathura
 usne sharia ke viruddh liye jane vaale lagbhag 80 karon ko samaapt karvaa diya
 These included local taxes called ‘raidari’ and ‘pandari’ also known as ‘abwab’
 aurangzeb ‘daarul herb’ ko ‘daarul islam’ main parivartit karne ko apana mahatvapurn lakshya maanata tha
 In Aurangzeb's time, pilgrims coming to Brij were heavily taxed, Jiziya tax was re-imposed and Hindus were converted to Muslims
 us samay ke kaviyon kii rachanaaon main aurangzeb ke atyaacharon kaa ullekh he
 The Jaziya tax levied by Aurangzeb was at that time
 akbar ne jajia kar ko samaapt kar diya tha, lekin aurangzeb ke samay yah dobaaraa lagu kiya gaya
 Jaziya was different from normal taxes that non-muslims had to pay
 iske teen str the or iskaa nirdhaaran sambandhit vyakti kii aamadani se hota tha
 There were some exceptions to this tax
 garibon, berozegaron or shaareerik rup se ashakt log iske daayre main nahin aate the
 Apart from these, Brahmins and government officials who were at the top of the varna system of Hindus were also out of it
 musalamaanon ke upar lagane vaala aisa hi dharmik kar jakaat tha jo har amir musalmaan ke liye dena zaruri tha 
 Jaziya was certainly a biased tax system on the norms of modern values
 aadhunik raashtra, dharm or jati ke aadhaar par is tarah kaa bhed nahin kar sakate
 That is why when we look at the 17th century system on the scale of modern nations, it may seem very chaotic, but it was not so during Aurangzeb
 us daur main iske duusare udhaaharan bhi milte hai
 As the Marathas evicted the Mughals from a large part of the south
 unki kar vyavastha bhi takreeban isi str kii pakshpaati thi
 They used to collect zakat from Muslims and the Hindu population was out of any such tax system
 aurangzeb ne jitne mandir tudwaaye, usase kahin zyada banawaye the
 According to the famous historian Richard Eaton, demolition of temples was a rare occurrence in the Mughal period and whenever it happened it was political because of it
 iton ke mutabik vahi mandir tode gaye jinamein vidrohiyon ko sharan milti thi yaa jinaki madad se badshaah ke khilaaf sajeesh rachi jaati thi
 At that time there was no religious purpose to break the temple
 is maamle main kukhyat kaha jane vaala aurangzeb bhi sultanate ke isi niyam par chalaa
 Examples of temple demolition during his reign are very rare and there are political reasons at his root
 udhaaharan ke liye aurangzeb ne dakshin bharat main kabhi-bhi mandiron ko nishaanaa nahin banaaya jabaki uske shasankaal main zyaadaatar sena yaheen tainaat thi
 He definitely attacked some temples in North India like Keshav Rai temple in Mathura but the reason was not religious
 mathura ke jaaton ne sultanate ke khilaaf vidroh kiya tha isliye yah hamalaa kiya gaya
 In contrast, Aurangzeb also patronized temples for reasons
 yah uski un hinduon ko bhent thi jo badshaah ke vafaadaar the
 Historian Catherine Butler of King's College, London even says that Aurangzeb had built more temples than he broke
 catherine frank, em athar ali or jilaluddin jaise vidwaan is taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki aurangzeb ne kai hindu mandiron ko anudaan diya tha jinamein banaras kaa jangam baadi math, chitrakoot kaa balaji mandir, elahabaad kaa someshwar nath mahadev mandir or guwahati kaa umanand mandir sabase jane-pahachaane naam hai
 In the period in the Mughal period, the talk of breaking the temples is so much in vogue, there is no special mention of this in the Hindus
 tark diya ja saktaa he ki us daur main aisa karnaa khatre se khaali nahin rahaa hoga, lekin 18veen shatabdi main jab sultanate khatm ho gai tab bhi is baat kaa kahin zikr nahin miltaa
 In the past, the issue of the demolition of Hindu temples by Mughal rulers became hot in India in the 1980s-90s
 aurangzeb ko kattarpanthi sabit karne kii koshish main ek bada tark yah bhi diya jaataa he ki usne sangeet par pratibandh laga diya tha, lekin yah baat bhi sahi nahin he
 Catherine explains that music was not banned in her court even in the Sultanate
 badshaah ne jis din rajgaddi sanbhali thi, har saal us din utsav main khub naach-gaanaa hota tha
 Some Dhrupadas include the name Aurangzeb, which suggests that music was patronized during his reign
 kuch aitihaasik tathy is baat kii taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki vah khud sangeet kaa acha jaankaar tha
 In mirat-e-alam, Bakhtawar Khan wrote that the emperor had knowledge like musical legends
 mughal vidwaan fakirullah ne raag darpan naam ke dastavej main aurangzeb ke pasandida gayakon or vaadakon ke naam darj kiye hai
 Aurangzeb was loved by his sons Azam Shah and history tells that Shah had become an accomplished musician during his father's lifetime
 aurangzeb ke shasankaal main sangeet ke phalne-phoolne kii baat karte hue catherine likhti hai, ‘500 saal ke puure mughalkaal kii tulana main aurangzeb ke samay farsi main sangeet par sabase zyada tikaa likhi gayi
 However, it is true that towards the end of his life, Aurangzeb became more religious and kept away from music and music
 lekin upar hamane jin baton kaa zikr kiya he use dekhte hue yah mana ja saktaa he ki usne kabhi apni nijee ichha ko sultanate kii aadhikarik niti nahin banaaya
 In the late Aurangzeb, the Marathas had increased in strength in the south
 unhen dabaane main shahi sena ko safalataa nahin mil rahi thi
 Therefore, in 1683 Aurangzeb himself went south with the army
 vah rajdhani se dur rahata hua, apane shashan−kaal ke lagbhag antim 25 varsh tak usee abhiyaan main rahaa
 After ruling for 50 years, he died in Ahmednagar in the south on 3 March 1707 AD
