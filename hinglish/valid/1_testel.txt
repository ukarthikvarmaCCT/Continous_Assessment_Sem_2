 tere naal lav ho gaya internet movie database par Several tens of millions uttari ndebele dakshini africa bhubhag kii ek baantu jati he jo ndebele samskruti parampara se judi he or maatrubhaasha ke rup main ndebele bhashaa kaa prayog karti he
 Their history began when the leader named Mzilikazi separated from the Zulu kingdom under King Shaka Zulu in the early 19th century, and this branch of the Zulu people went and occupied the lands of the southern Ndebele people

 In the British colonial period they were called Matabele
 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The Syamantak Mani is a rare, spiritual gem
 is mani main ek sookshm shakti hoti he jo kii aadhyatmik or sansaarik pragati main sahaayak karti he
 Its story is told from Dwapara era
 ek baar nandakishor ne sanatkumaron se kaha ki chouth kii chandramaa ke darshan karne se shrikrishna par jo laanchhan laga tha, vah siddhi vinayak vrath karne se hi dur hua tha
 Sunkumaris were surprised to hear this
 unhone purnabrahm shrikrishna ko kalank lagane kii katha poochi to nandakishor ne bataaya
 Once, due to the fear of austerity, Shri Krishna started living in the middle of the sea
 isi nagari kaa naam aajkal dwarikapuri he
 Satrajit, who lived in Dwarikapuri, worshiped Suryanarayana
 tab bhagwaan surya ne use nity aath bhaar sona dene vaali syamantak naamak mani apane gale se utarkar de di
 Shrikrishna expressed his desire to get that gem when he got into the society after getting a gem
 satrajit ne vah mani shrikrishna ko na dekar apane bhai prasenjit ko de di
 One day, he went on a hunting horse and went for hunting
 vahaan ek sher ne use maar daalaa or mani le lee
 The king of bears, Jamwant, killed the lion and went to the cave with a gem
 jab prasenjit kai dinon tak shikaar se na lautaa to satrajit ko bada dukh hua
 He thought, Sri Krishna must have killed him to get the gem
 atah bina kisi prakaar kii jaankaree jutaaye usne prachaar kar diya ki shrikrishna ne prasenjit ko markar syamantak mani chin lee he
 Srikrishna along with many people went to the forest to find Prasenjit to stop this public blasphemy
 vahaan par prasenjit ko sher dwaara maar daalana or sher ko rich dwaara maarane ke chihn unhen mil gaye
 While searching for bear's feet, they reached the cave of Jamawant and went inside the cave
 vahaan unhone dekha ki jamvant kii putree us mani se khel rahi he
 Jamwant was ready for war upon seeing Krishna
 yuddh chhid gaya
 Outside the cave, Sri Krishna's companions waited for him for seven days
 phir ve log unhen mar gaya jaanakar pashchaatap karte hue dwarikapuri laut gaye
 Here, even after fighting continuously for twenty-one days, Jamwant could not defeat Shri Krishna
 tab usne sochaa, kahin yah vah avatar to nahin jiske liye mujhe ramchandraji kaa vardaan mila tha
 On getting this confirmation, he married his daughter to Sri Krishna and gave Mani in dowry
 shrikrishna jab mani lekar waapas aae to satrajit apane kiye par bahut lajjit hua
 To get rid of this shame, he also married his daughter to Shri Krishna
 kuch samay ke baad shrikrishna kisi kaam se indraprastha chale gaye
 Then with the opinion of Akrur and Ritu Verma, Shatdhanva killed Mani and took Mani in his possession
 satrajit kii maut kaa samachar jab shrikrishna ko mila tove tatkaal dwarika pahunche
 They agreed to kill Shatdhanva and snatch the gem
 is kaary main sahaayta ke liye balram bhi taiyaar the
 Knowing this, Shatdhanva gave Mani to Akrur and escaped on her own
 shrikrishna ne uskaa peechha karke use maar to daalaa, par mani unhen nahin mil pai
 Balramji also reached there
 shrikrishna ne unhen bataaya ki mani iske paas nahin he
 Balaramji did not believe
 ve aprasann hokar vidarbha chale gaye
 On Shri Krishna's return to Dwarka, people insulted him heavily
 tatkaal yah samachar fail gaya ki syamantak mani ke lobh main shrikrishna ne apane bhai ko bhi tyaag diya
 Shri Krishna was mourning the insult he received that suddenly Naradji came there
 unhone shrikrishnaji ko bataaya- aapane bhadrapada shukla chaturthi ke chandramaa kaa darshan kiya tha
 That is why you have to be stung like this
 shrikrishna ne poocha- chouth ke chandramaa ko aisa kya ho gaya he jiske kaaran uske darshanamaatr se manushya kalankit hota he
 Then Naradji said- Once Brahmaji had fasted Ganesh on the day of Chaturthi
 ganeshji neprakat hokar var maangane ko kaha to unhone maanga ki mujhe sristi kii rachana karne kaa moh na ho
 As Ganeshji started walking as 'aastastu', Chandramane was ridiculed by seeing his bizarre personality
 is par ganeshji ne rusht hokar chandramaa ko shaap diya ki aaj se koi tumhaara mukh nahin dekhnaa chahega
 After cursing, Ganeshji went to his own world and hid in the lakes of Moon Mansarovar
 chandramaa ke bina praaniyon ko bada ksht hua
 Seeing their suffering, pleased with the fast of all the gods by Brahma's command, Ganesha gave a boon that now the moon will be freed from the curse, but whoever sees the moon on Bhadrapad Shukla Chaturthi, he will surely feel a false stash of theft etc
 kintu jo manushya prayek dwitiya ko darshan karata rahegaa, vah is laanchhan se batch jayega
 By fasting Siddhi Vinayak on this Chaturthi all the doshas will be released
 yah sunakar devtaa apane-apane sthaan ko chale gaye
 In this way, you have got this stigma by seeing the moon on Bhadrapad Shukla Chaturthi
 tab shrikrishna ne kalank se mukt hone ke liye yahi vrath kiya tha
 Yudhishthira asked Lord Krishna in the battle of Kurukshetra - God! What is the measure of man's desire for fulfillment? How can a man attain wealth, sons, good fortune and victory? Hearing this, Shri Krishna replied - If you worship Parvati's son Shri Ganesh in a proper way, then surely you will get everything
 tab shrikrishna kii ajna se hi yudhisthirji ne ganesh chaturthi kaa vrath karke mahabharat kaa yuddh jeeta tha
 This fourth is famous by the name Ganesh Chaturthi

 isamen australia ke uttar or uttar-purv ke kai dweep shaamil hai, jaise ke nayaa gini, fiji, solomon dweepasmooh, vanuatu, vakairaah
 The name "malanisia" comes from the addition of two Greek words - "melas" ie "black" and "nisos" meaning "island"
 isliye "malanishia" ke naam kaa matlab "kaale dweep" he, jo in dwipon par rahane vaali maanav jatiyon kii kaali twachaa kii taraf ek ishaara he
 The name was coined by French naval leader and explorer Zhum Dumayan Tewariya in 1832 to differentiate between Polynesia and the region because the people of these two areas are neighbors but their castes are somewhat different from each other

 The languages written by various scholars on the Gitabhasya Gita are called, the major commentaries written by various scholars on the Bhagavad Gita are as follows- stock-mulya gatividhi par dou siddhant ek takneekee vishleshan he jisamen sector roteshan ke kuch pahalu shaamil hai
 This theory was derived from 255 editors of The Wall Street Journal, written by Charles H
 Dow, was a journalist, founder and first editor of the Wall Street Journal, and a co-founder of Dow Jones & Company
 dou kii mrityu ke baad, wiliam peter hamiltan, robert riya or i
 jorge shifer ne dou siddhant ko, jo dou ke sampadakeey par aadhaarit tha sangathit kiya or samuhik rup se pesh kiya
 The Dow itself never used the term "dow theory" nor did it present itself as a trading system
 hamiltan, riya or shifer dwaara sankshepit dou siddhant ke chah buniyadi tatwon ko neeche varnit kiya gaya he
 Educational support for the profitability of the Dow theory is not high
 alfred couls ne 1934 ke iconometrica ke ek adhyayan main darshaya ki sampadakeey salaah par aadhaarit trading main behatar vibhajit portpholio kaa upyog karte hue bai-and-hold ranneeti kii tulana main kam kamai hoti he
 Cowles concluded that the buy-and-keep strategy generated 15
5% annual profits from 1902–1929, while the Dow theory strategy generated 12% annual profits
 baad ke varshon main kai adhyayanon dwaara couls kaa samarthan kiye jane par, kai shikshavidon ne dou siddhant ko padhanaa band kar diya, yah maanate hue ki couls ke parinaam nirnaayak hai
 However, in recent years, Cowles' findings have been revisited
 wiliam goetzaman, stephen brown or alok kumaar kaa maananaa he ki coul kaa adhyayan adhuraa tha or dou siddhant, jokhim-samyojit atyadhik munaafe ko utpann karti he
 Specifically, the buy-and-hold strategy had a 2% higher than the Dow theory portfolio, but the Dow theory portfolio had lower risk and volatility, leading to higher risk-adjusted returns by the Dow theory portfolio, according to their study be provided

 parantu jahaan tak sarkaar kaa sambandh he in teenon bainko kaa mukhya kaary samay-samay par rin jutaney main sarkaar kii sahaayta karnaa va sarkari pratibhutiyon ke mulyon ko sthirataa pradaan karnaa tha
 There were significant changes in the terms of operation of the Bank of Bengal, Bombay and Madras after 1860
 1861 ke paper karency act ke paarit ho jane se presidency bainkon kaa mudra jari karne kaa adhikaar samaapt kar diya gaya tathaa 1 march 1862 se britain shasit bharat main kaagazi mudra jari karne kaa mul adhikaar bharat sarkaar ko praapt ho gaya
 The responsibility of managing and operating the new paper currency was entrusted to the Presidency Banks and the Government of India took the responsibility of transferring deposits in the treasury to the banks where the banks would open their branches
 tab tak teenon presidency bainkon kii koi shakha nahin thi jabaki unke samvidhan ke antargat unhen yah adhikaar praapt tha
 But as soon as the three presidency banks got assurance of using the deposits in the treasury without interruption, they started to open branches of the bank at those places rapidly
 san 1876 tak teenon presidency bainkon kii shakhaayen, abhikaran va up-abhikaranon ne desh ke pramukh kshetron tathaa bharat ke bhitari bhaagon main sthit vyapaar kendro main apana vistaar kar liya
 Bank of Bengal had 18 branches including its headquarters, temporary branches, and sub-agencies while Bank of Bombay and Madras each had 15 branches
 1 may 1876 se lagu presidency banks act ke dwaara vyavsaay par ekasmaan pratibandhon ke saath teen presidency bainkon ko ek samaan kanoon ke antargat laayaa gaya
 However, the ownership relationship of the government was terminated despite the banks having custody of public debt offices in three presidency towns and a portion of government deposits
 is act dwaara kalakatta, bombai evam madras main teen arakshit koshon ke srijan kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya jahaan presidency bainkon ko keval unke pradhan karyaalayon main rakhane ke liye nirdhaarit nunatam raashi se adhik kii jamaarashiyaan rakhi jaati thim
 The government could lend to the presidency banks from these reserve funds, but these banks saw it as a grace rather than a right
 presidency bainkon ke saamaanya niyantran ke baahar arakshit koshon main atirikt jamaarashiyon ko rakhane ke sarkaar ke nirnay tathaa un nae sthanon par jahaan shakhaayen kholi jaani thi, sarkaar kii nunatam jamaarashiyon kii guarantee na dene ke usase jude nirnay se varsh 1876 ke baad nai shakhaon kii vruddhi kaaphi baadhit hui
 Despite the slow pace of expansion in the last decade, the case of Bank of Madras continued to grow, as this bank benefited mainly from the trade between several cities connected to the port of the Presidency and the inner centers of the country

 Due to tea and coffee plantations, large areas of the eastern Terai, Assam and Nilgiris Mountains were transformed into excellent real estate

 The three presidency banks were both beneficiaries and promoters of this process of commercialization as they became practically involved in financing every business, manufacturing and quarrying activity of the sub-continent
 bengal evam bombai ke bank bade aadhunik vinirmaan udyogon ke vittaposhan main lage the, jabaki bank of madras laghu udyogon kaa vittaposhan karne laga jaise anyatra kahin bhi hota nahin tha
 But these three banks were kept away from any foreign exchange related business
 sarkari jamaarashiyon ko rakhane vaale in bainkon ke liye aisa vyavsaay jokhim mana gaya saath hi yah bhay bhi mahasoos kiya gaya ki sarkari sangrakshan praapt in bainkon se us samay bharat main aae vinimay bainkon ke liye ek anuchit pratispardhaa utpann hogi
 Till the formation of Reserve Bank of India in the year 1935, these banks were kept away from this business

 These three banks were transformed into a joint entity and a large bank emerged among Indian commercial banks

 But behind this formation was a discussion on the need of the State Bank of India for years
 ant main ek mili-juli sanstha ubhar kar saamne ai jo vanijyik bank evam ardh-kendriya bank ke kaary nishpadit karti thi
 With the formation of the Reserve Bank of India as the central bank of India in 1935, the role of the semi-central bank of the Imperial Bank came to an end
 imperial bank bharat sarkaar kaa bank na rahakar aise kendron main jahaan kendriya bank nahin he, sarkari vyavsaay ke nishpaadan ke liye bhartiya reserve bank kaa agent ban gaya
 But it continued to operate the depots of currency chests and small coins and to operate the Remittance Facility Scheme for other banks and the public on the terms set by the Reserve Bank of India
 vah bankeron kaa atirikt nakad apane paas rakhkar tathaa praadhikrut pratibhuti par unhen rin dekar unke bank ke rup main bhi kaary karne laga
 The bank also managed clearing houses at many places where the Reserve Bank of India did not have offices
 yah bank sarkaar kii taraf se reserve bank dwaara yojit rajkoshiya bill nilaamiyon main sabase bada nividakarta bhi rahaa
 After the establishment of the Reserve Bank, important amendments were made to its constitution to convert the Imperial Bank into a commercial bank
 uske vyavsaay par purv main lagaae gaye pratibandhon ko hataaya gaya tathaa pehali baar bank ko videshi mudra vyavsaay karne tathaa nishpadak evam nyaasi vyavsaay karne kii anumati di gai
 The Imperial Bank has recorded very impressive growth in the form of offices, reserves, deposits, investments and advances during the three and a half decades since its existence
 kuch maamalon main yah vruddhi chah guna se bhi adhik rahi
 The financial position and security inherited from the predecessors unambiguously provided the bank a solid and robust platform

 Due to all this, Imperial Bank attained a very special position in the Indian banking industry and also gained an important place in the economic life of the country

 varsh 1951 main jab pratham panchavashiya yojana shuru hui to desh ke gramin kshetra ke vikaas ko isamen sarvocch praathamikta di gai
 Till then, the commercial banks of the country, including the Imperial Bank of India, were confined to the urban sector and were not fully prepared to meet the future requirements of economic reconstruction of rural areas

 Accordingly, an Act was passed in Parliament in May 1955 and the State Bank of India was formed on 1 July 1955
 is prakaar bhartiya banking pranali kaa ek chauthai se bhi adhik sansaadhan sarkaar ke sidhe niyantran main aa gaya
 Later, in 1959 the State Bank of India Act was passed which resulted in the State Bank of India acquiring eight associate banks of the erstwhile states as subsidiaries, thus leading to the emergence of the State Bank of India with a new obligation of social purpose

 The conference included the ruler of the Tsar Alkjender i of Prussia, Friedrich William III of Austria, the Tellerna of France, Metrénique, Austria, and the Foreign Minister of England, Lord Castlere, etc
 In which all the minor rulers of Europe except Turkey were present
 congress kii samasya- The Vienna Congress had many problems
 sarv pratham nepolian ke yudhon ke chalate europea maanchitr main kaaphi parivartan aa gaya tha
 The question of the restoration of these states before the Vienna Congress was the second problem was to suppress the revolutionary spirit
 carch kaa prashn bhi bahut badi samasya thi
 The members of Vienna wanted to reestablish the Church's influence
 chauthi samasya yuddh kii sambhaavna ko samaapt karnaa tha taaki pun: nepolian jaisaa koi shaktishaalee vyakti paidaa nahin ho sake
 Rewarding the conquered nations was another problem
 vienna congress ke siddhant evam uddeshy- The Vienna Congress had some principles for the solution of the above mentioned problems which are as follows
 shakti santulan kaa siddhant- Its main principle was the balance of power, that is, Holland could be extended to Switzerland, Baberia and Serdinia to ban France so that no country could become powerful enough to become dangerous to others
 france chaaron taraf se majboot rajyon se ghir gaya
 In the same way, Germany was made so powerful that the administration could not lift the head
 italy main austria kii sthapit kii gai is prakaar shakti santulan sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 So that power throughout Europe remains at peace
 vaidhata kaa siddhant- On the basis of this principle, the European map of 1789 was adopted by accepting the boundaries and attempting to demarcate various European states
 holland, purtegal, neples, tathaa italy aadi rajya anek puraane rajvansh ko lautaa diya gaya
 Principle of Damage Supply is siddhant ke anusaar jin deshon ko nepolian ne nasht kiya tha or jinhone uske khilaaf sangharsh kiya tha
 It was accepted to compensate and reward them
 jin deshon ne nepolian kaa saath diya tha
 He was punished
 france ke viruddh seemaant rajyon ko shaktishaalee bananaa-iskaa chauthaa siddhant france ke viruddh seemaant rajyon ko shaktishaalee banaaya jaae taaki france antarrashtriya shakti ko bhang nahin kar sake
 Apart from the above principles, it had other principles
 shanti- samjhauta ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye iske peeche bhi shakti honi chahie
 Thus, England, Austria, Russia and Russia gave rise to the European system as a result of this principle of the four-pronged treaty
 vienna congress ke nirnay evam pradeshik vyavastha- The territorial system it established had the following objectives
 jin deshon ne nepolian ko haraane main hissaa liya tha unhen puraskaar or jo parajeet hue the unhen dand milanaa chahie
 In Europe, the system before the revolution should be implemented
 jisase europea vyavastha kaa nirmaan ho or shanti tathaa suraksha kaayam rakhaa ja sake
 The states that Napoleon included in France were taken away
 or france main pracheen rajvansh ko phir se sthapit kiya gaya
 England had colonial and trade benefits
 malta, saint, lucienna, morishas ke dweep france se lekar england ko de diya gaya
 Prasha also benefited by giving him the territories of Northern Saxony, Salasapel and Triale, as a result his kingdom doubled and gained influence in southern Germany
 belgium ko holend main shaamil kiya gaya or vahaan phir se angrej rajvansh kii sthapana kii gai
 Austria was given the territories of Belizea and Lombardi, Italy

 Italy was divided into small kingdoms and given to the ancient rulers there and the influence of Austria was established in Italy

 use 22 rajyon kaa shaktishaalee sangh banaaya gaya
 The decisions of Congress regarding Germany were quite important
 germany ke bache hue 38 rajyon ko milakar ek sangh banaaya gaya
 Whose head was the Emperor Francisco i of Austria
 iske atirikt congress ne or bhi anek kaary kiye usne das- pratha ko aniatik banaaya
 Decisions were also taken regarding international methods
 bhavishya main europea shanti ko kaayam rakhane ke liye ek antarrashtriya sanstha kii sthapana kii gai jise europea vyavastha kaha jaataa he
 Evaluation of the actions of the Vienna Congress- vienna congress kaa aarambh ucch aadarshon evam uddeshyon kii ghoshnaa ke saath hua tha
 But his purpose was not served
 uskaa kaary karne kaa dhang doshapurn tha
 All nations were engaged in accomplishing their selfishness
 at: samasyaon ke samaadhaan main yah asafal rahaa
 The program of the Vienna Conference was based on selfishness
 iske sadasyon ne naitik siddhanton ko apeksha kii
 Therefore, its decisions proved to be temporary redundant
 isane europe ke nav nirmaan main koi aisa prayaas nahin kiya jisase janata kii ichha kii purti ho sake or sthaayee taur par vyavastha kaayam ho sake
 It determined the national boundary only on the basis of the principle of power balance, but gave some importance to the popular sentiment
 isapar dusraa aarope yah lagaaya jaataa he ki isane kuch kaaryon ko adhura chhod diya or kuch samasyaon par isane dhyaan nahin diya jaise- europea shanti ko surakshit rakhane ke ek liye ek sandhi patr par hastakshar karnaa tha lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 Some historians have called the Vienna Congress reactionary
 iske liye rashtriya bhaavana kii koi keemat nahin thi isapar yah bhi aarope he ki bade rashtron ke hiton k raksha ke liye chote rashtron ke hiton kii upeksha kii gai
 In spite of the above allegations, one has to accept that political restraint and far-sightedness were employed in Vienna
 germany or italy ke ekikaran kii disha main isane mahatvapurn kaam kiya
 Not only this, the practice of slavery, trade, freedom etc
 was also considered
 rajyon kii araajaktaa ko nasht karne kii disha main isane mahatvapurn kaam kiya
 It also created the international constitution
 iske kaaryon ke falswarup europe main 40 varshon tak shanti bani rahi
 The meeting was called for the first time to discuss international issues
 or isane europea vyavastha kaa sanghathan kiya tha ise ham pratham antareashtriya sangton kah sakate he
 This was a huge achievement
 uparokt uddeshyon tathaa lakshyon kii prapti ke liye vienna kangeras ne kuch siddhanth banaae jo nimna the- The colonial empire of England was increased

 is prakaar austria ne khoi shakti or pratishtha punah praapt kar lee
 Italy was divided into many small states
 italy vastutah, meternik ke shabdon main, keval ek bhugolic abhivyakti ban kar rahaa gaya
 Thus Austria's influence over Italy was established
 vienna kangeras main das pratha kaa virodh kiya gaya
 The Congress created an international institution known as the 'european system' to maintain peace
 pehali baar antarrashtriya samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 Through this, the issues of the movement of ships in the rivers, the use of the sea and the mutual dealings between nations were explained
 vienna kangeras kii mukhya uplabdhi yah rahi ki isane europe main lagbhag 40 varshon tak shanti kii sthapana kii jisaki europavaasiyon ko us samay sarvaadhik jarurat thi
 The Vienna Congress tried to establish peace at the international level and established the first international organization by establishing the European system, on whose foundation the foundation of the United Nations and the United Nations was built
 vienna kangeras main france ke saath apekshaakrit nyaaypurna vyavhaar kiya gaya tha or parajeet shakti hone ke baavjood use kangeras main pratinidhitiv diya gaya, jabaki pratham vishwayuddh ke pashchaat varsay kii sandhi main parajeet germany ko pratinidhitiv nahin mila or sandhi ke kade praavdhaan us par thope die gaye
 In conclusion, we can say that the Vienna Congress immediately established peace in Europe
 france ke saath naram vyavhaar karne jaise sakaaratmak kadam uthaae
 But, trying to stop the spread of ideology like liberalism, nationalism, worked against the stream of history
 is drushti se vienna kangeras pratikriyaavaadi maansikta kaa pratinidhitiv karti thi
