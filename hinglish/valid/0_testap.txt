 ) Ballia's socialist leader Neeraj Shekhar, who is at the extreme end of eastern Uttar Pradesh, has resigned from the Rajya Sabha and the Samajwadi Party
 niraj ke bhaajapa main shaamil hone kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 Neeraj, the son of the eighth and only socialist Prime Minister of the country Chandrashekhar, has raised questions that whether he will take the political legacy of his father with which he will hold the political legacy, will he sit down and sit in the lotus lap? After the defeat, the SP sent him to the Rajya Sabha
 2019 ke haalia chunaav main vah baliya seat se tikat ke daavedaar the, lekin party ne bhaajapa ummidavaar virendra singh mast ke saamne niraj kii bajaay purv vidhayak sanathan pandeya ko utaar diya
 Significantly, in the first parliamentary by-election of 2007 in his political life, Neeraj Shekhar had defeated Virender Singh Mast
 tikat na milane ke baad se hi vah naaraaz chal rahe the
 During the entire campaign, he was not even seen once on the party candidate's stage
 chandrashekhar ke nidhan ke baad shuru kiya tha siyaasi safarchandrashekhar jab tak jivit rahe, baliya sansadeey seat se saansad nirvaachit hote rahe
 He was last elected as an MP from Ballia in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections
 2007 main unka nidhan hua or iske baad rikt hui baliya sansadeey seat ke liye hue upachunaav se niraj shekhar ke siyaasi safar kii shuruyaat hui
 There was a period of speculation about who would handle Chandrasekhar's legacy
 chandrashekhar sahi myanon main samaajawaadee raajnneeti ke pairokaar the
 This was also proved by his conduct
 parivaarwaad ke dhur virdohi chandrashekhar ke jeevankaal main unke parivaar kaa koi sadsy raajnneeti main sakriy nahin tha
 In 2007 byelection, Neeraj Shekhar presented himself as the heir to his father's political legacy, but erased a sign of the same father
 niraj ne chandrashekhar kii banaai party sajapa kaa sapa main vilay kar diya or bargad ke ped kii jagah cycle ke nishaan par chunaav ladaa
 This was new for the Ballia residents in the parliamentary elections
 sapa ne kabhi bhi chandrashekhar ke khilaaf pratyaashee nahin utaara tha
 In such a situation, the question is now arising that Neeraj wants to give a different message than his father's path
 chandrashekhar ne padayatra kar uda di thi indira kii neendyuva turk ke naam se prasiddh desh ke ekmaatr samaajawaadee pradhanmantri chandrashekhar kii pahchaan aise netaa ke rup main he, jise sheersh se kam manjuur nahin hota tha
 Whether he was in power or organization, born in a peasant family, Chandrasekhar should also remain on this line
 apatkaal virdohi lahar main 1977 kaa chunaav jitkar pehali baar baliya se sansad pahunche chandrashekhar ne tab janata dal sarkaar main mantri pad grahan karne kii bajaay party ke adhyaksh pad ko tavajjo di
 Later formed his own party and was the lifetime president
 chandrashekhar mantri bane bhi to sidhe pradhanmantri
 Chandrashekhar took a padyatra from Kanyakumari to Rajghat in New Delhi as the President of the Janata Party, and woke up the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 bhaajapa netaaon se behatar rahe rishte, par kabhi nahin kiya samarthanchandrashekhar ke khilaaf bhaajapa ne lagbhag har loksabhaa chunaav main ummidavaar utaare, lekin chunaav jeetne ke liye jor kabhi nahin lagaaya
 According to experts who were close to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Vajpayee used to say 'go ahead - go ahead' as soon as Chandrasekhar's seat Ballia was named in the party meeting for candidate selection
 log samaj jate ki baliya seat par chandrashekhar ke khilaaf bahut zyada dimag lagane kii jarurat nahin
 Chandrasekhar's relations with BJP leaders have always been better, but he never supported the bjp's ideology
 purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko taumr 'guruji' shabd se hi sambodhit kiya, lekin sadan main hameshaa mukhar virodh bhi kiya
 Struggling for public welfare by rising above power, Chandrashekhar always fought with the fund and fought for public welfare
 congress main rahete hue bhi samaajawaadee siddhanton par adig rahe or jab sawaal uthe to kaha ki yaa to congress samaajawaadee raah par chal padegi yaa phir tut jaaegi
 Chandrasekhar used to reach the farmers' fields even when he was the Prime Minister
 vah chunavi kharch ke liye paise chande se ekatrit karte the
 Their public meetings were spread with angochas or skirts
 siyasat or satta, donon ke sheersh tak kaa safar tay karne or lakh jhanjhaavaton se do-chaar hone, congress main hote hue bhi apatkaal kaa mukhar virodh or jepi andolan kaa samarthan kar police-prashasan kii pratadna jhelane vaale chandrashekhar ke putr kaa samaajawaadee khadaauun utarkar bhaajapa kaa daaman tham lenaa apane pita ke siddhanton ke khilaaf nahin to kya he?

 sattaaise june ko nai dilli main badi saadagi bhare aayojan main videsh sachiv es
 Jaishankar signed the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and thus India became the 35th member of this special club
 yah ek tarah se bharat kii jeet thi kyonki isaki sthapana 1987 main bharat or anya ubharate deshon ke khilaaf kii gai thi, taaki unhen parmaanu missile nirmaan ke liye jaruri takneekee or saamagree kharidne se roka ja sake
 India's entry into it is also special because despite many efforts, China has not yet become a member of it
 MTCR main safal, NSG main vifaljahan bharat main rajanyik or vaigyanik tabaka is uplabdhi par fakhr mahasoos kar rahaa tha, vahiin bharat sarkaar khamosh thi kyonki parmaanu aapurti samooh (enesji) kii sadsyta kii uski daavedaari ko jabardast dhakka pahunchaa tha
 The 48-member NSG was established in 1974 in view of India's first nuclear tests and strict rules were made under which its members could not carry out nuclear business with countries that did not sign the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) Huh
 bharat ne lagaaya tha puraa jorisase pehle tseol main 20-24 june tak chaliensijiki baithak main bharat ne iskaa sadsy banane ke liye ek jabardast or thakaa dene vaali ladaai lard thi
 In May this year, India made a formal application for its membership
 2004 main enesji kaa sadsy bana china uske saamne diwaar banakar khadaa ho gaya or apane liye sahmati banane main jute bharat ke khilaaf abhiyaan kaa netritv kiya
 However, member nations can continue to do business with India as the NSG gave India a special exemption in 2008, which it got after the indo-us civil nuclear deal
 phir bhi yah nirvivaad tha ki tseol main aayaa nateeja bharat ke rajanyik prayaason ke liye bada jhatka tha
 Opposition parties surrounded the government, the Opposition parties immediately grabbed the issue and started taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'bad timing,' noisy diplomatic mistake
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne twit kiya, 'enesziah kis tarah narendra modi ne samjhauta vaarta ko haath se jane diya
 When India already has leeway, intellectuals and former diplomats questioned India's efforts for the NSG
 haalanki sabase bada sawaal apni jagah par hi kaayam rahaah aakhir bharat ne enesji kii purna sadsyta ke liye itani koshish kyon kii? kya modi sarkaar hameshaa nakaaratmak rahane waalon khaskar china se sahi dhang se nibati? india today ne enesji ko lekar bharat ke abhiyaan se jude vibhinn adhikariyon se baat kii or andar kii kahani se yah pataa chalaa ki yah kootnithik shikast nahin thi, jaisaa ise bataaya ja rahaa he balki sochaa samajha or saahasik kadam tha
 Know how kya bharat ko enesji sadsyta ke liye dabaav bananaa chahie?sabase zyada aalochana is baat ko lekar ho rahi he ki bharat ko pehle hi enesji se chhot praapt he, aise main jise 'dwitiya shrenee kii sadsyta' kaha jaataa he, use paane ke liye itani mehnat karne kii kya jarurat thi, jisase koi visheshadhikaar nahin milane vaala
 Senior diplomat Satyabrata Pal wrote in The Hindu: 'this frenzy for a non-vital thing like NSG was not diplomacy but naivety
 'saahas kii saraahnapal ke tarkon ke saath likhe gaye is lekh main un kai anivaary baton kii andekhi kii gai he jinase bharat ko enesji sadsyta ke apane safar ke dauraan do-chaar hona padaa he
 When Narendra Modi took charge of India in May 2014, despite Manmohan Singh's unprecedented achievement of ending India's untouchable status in nuclear commerce, there were many tasks that were incomplete
 bharat-america parmaanu samjhaute ko lekar apni party ke virodhon kii unhone andekhi kii or modi ne buland iraadon ke saath patibaddhtaon or praavdhaanon ko lagu karne kii disha main kadam badaye or unke dwipaksheeya nazariye kii saraahna kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Efforts in international forums One of the most important priorities is to intensify India's efforts to become a member of all types of nuclear prohibition systems, including the NSG, which is being banned for this purpose so that India can develop protective measures against the destructive weapons
 Try to slow down or stop
 november 2010 main america raashtrapati baraak obama ne manmohan singh se vaada kiya tha ki america bharat ko enesji kaa purna sadsy banane ke alaava baaki teen aprasar vyavasthaaon kaa bhi sadsy banane kii ore kaam karegaa
 These are the three systems: the Australia Group (control over the spread of chemical biological weapons), the Wassenaar Arrangement (control over the export of dual-use goods and technology) and the MTCR
 2011 main shuru hui thi koshishmodi kii team ne paaya ki manmohan singh kii sarkaar ne chaaron aprasar vyavasthaaon kaa sadsy banane kii disha main 2011 se hi koshishen kin lekin kai vajahon se uski koshishon main pachada laga rahaa
 "it was a policy decision at that time, but we tried many hands at the same time which were not in our bus," said a senior Foreign Ministry official
 sabhi chaar vyavasthaaon main khaas tarah ke prashasnic or kanoonee upayon kii jarurat he, jiske liye vibhinn mantralayon main ek talmail bananaa hoga
 So it was impossible
 "nishane par sidhe-sidhe bharatisaliye chaaron ke liye ek hi samay main koshish karne ke badale modi kii team ne praathamiktaayen tay karne kaa faisla kiya or enesji tathaa emticiar kii sadsyta ke maamle ko usne sabase upar rakhaa
 Apart from other concerns on the NSG, there is also the fact that in 2008 the UPA-1 government had claimed that it had "clear exemption" from the NSG
 lekin vah sthiti teen saal baad badal gai jab upie-2 satta main tha
 In 2011 the NSG revised its guidelines and banned all members from trading in nuclear enrichment and reprocessing technology with a country that did not sign the NPT
 bharat enpiti par 1968 main isaki shuruyaat se hi dastakhat karne se inkaar karata rahaa he or ise bhedbhaavpurn bataata rahaa he
 This meant that the target of the NSG amendment was directly India
 kya he pashchimi deshon kaa ravaiya?bharat ke virodh karne par america, rus or france ne bayaan jari kiya ki ve enesji ke nae disha-nirdeshon ke baavjood bharat ko apane samjhaute ke tahat 'puraa parmaanu eendhan chakra' muhaiyaa karaane ko taiyaar hai
 But one official says, "it was our policy makers then that the NSG can change its rules and we may be forced to obey it
" isliye yah jaruri tha ki ham yaa to faisle lene vaali mandali ke saath baithte yaa phir baahar intjaar karte rahete or hamase kaha jaataa ki ham kar sakate hai yaa nahin kar sakate
 'why UPA-2 could not do it? Modi was advised to open all types of horses for NSG membership
 vajah yah thi ki obama ko apana vaada puraa karnaa padataa or america prashasan ko majaboor hona padataa jaisaa ki usne 2008 main kiya tha
 In view of the circumstances of the last years of UPA-2, there was a slight strain in the indo-us relations
 isliye 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke baad vija dene se inkaar karne ke america ravaie se aahat hone ke baavjood modi ne fouran bharat-america rishton ko sudhaarney kaa bada kadam uthaaya or sitambar 2014 main obama ke saath apni pehali mulaakaat main hi nijee tallukaat sthapit karne kii koshish kii
 Modi tried to make his government an image of being more open to business
 america companiyon ne unase kaha ki bharat-america parmaanu samjhaute ke baad unhen ummid thi ki ve bharat ko parmaanu sanyantr bech sakenge or vah donon deshon ke liye phydemand hota
 But their efforts were overshadowed by problems with the new Indian nuclear accountability law, which was passed by Parliament in 2010
 piem modi ne banaai thi timmodi ne america se lautate hi is samasya se paar paane ke liye videsh, vitt or kanoon mantralayon kii ek team kaa gathan kiya
 Under India's new accountability law, the parent company will be responsible for any defect in the nuclear plant and will have to pay heavy compensation
 america ko isamen khatra dikhaa
 Russia and France also did not like it
 ye donon bhi bharat main nae parmaanu urja sanyantr lagane ke liye saudebaaji kar rahe the
 These people said that this law does not match the current international norms on accountability
 nijee gharelu parmaanu sanyantr companiyaan bhi nae kanoon se vimukh ho gayi
 So Modi's team tried to get rid of this problem by manipulating the controversial sections of accountability without amending the law
 sarkaar ne july 2015 main 1,500 karod ru
 Set up a special Indian nuclear insurance account that takes care of the accountability of both foreign and domestic nuclear plant suppliers

 ek, paris jalwaayu parivartan shikhar sammelan or duusare, yah tathy ki obama kaa kaarykaal disambar, 2016 main khatm ho jayega
 India was perceived as a problem at the November 2015 Climate Change Summit as it refused to reduce its dependence on coal and other fossil fuels
 modi ne bade saahas ke saath halaat badal die or bharat ko uskaa hissaa bana diya
 There Modi promised that by 2030 India would increase its share of energy through non-fossil fuels to 40 percent of the total
 uske baad unhone antarrashtriya saura urja sahyog kii ruparekha taiyaar kii taaki saura urja kii sasti or kargar takanic hasil kii ja sake
 Not only solar power in the government's enthusiasm on power generation, Modi and his team were also calculating that with the huge increase in nuclear power plant, India will achieve this goal
 philhal parmaanu bijli sanyantr se kareeb 6,000 megawatt bijli banati he or yah desh kii kul bijli khapat kii mahaj teen fisadi he
 Modi formulated an aggressive plan to set up a nuclear power plant for 63,000 MW of power by 2032
 is tarah yah desh kii kul bijli utpaadan kaa nau pratishat tak ho jayega
 Therefore, in addition to allowing 16 new domestic power plants to produce an additional 10,600 MW power, the Modi government has tied up with foreign companies of the US, Russia and France to set up 26 new power plants, which will generate 29,500 MW

 parmaanu kaarobaar main europe, korea or japan jaise bade khiladinnon ne kaha ki agar bharat sadsy ban jaataa he to unhen aasaani hogi or nivesh ke vaade ko nibhaana mushkil nahin hoga
 In this way, membership of NSG became necessary for India
 ek adhikari ke mutabik, ''enesji kii sadsyta niveshkon ke liye utkrisht reating (eee) jaisi he
 "then by adding NSG membership to the goal of climate change, India was putting additional pressure on big countries

 "kya bharat ne daanv lagane se pehle taiyaari puri kar lee thi?argentina ke rajdoot kaa suzalaktubar, 2015 main argentina ke rajdoot rafel mariano grosi, jo tab enesji kii adhyakshata ke asana par the, apni vaarshik samiksha ke liye aae to bharat ne unase salaah maangi ki sadsyta ke aavedan kaa behatar tarika kya he
 Grossi suggested that members should talk and understand their concerns before making a formal application, then offer to them how India is addressing their concerns
 bharat ne sabhi sadsy deshon ko likhi chittheeis saal april main enesji paraamarsh samooh kii vienna main baithak ke dauraan bharat ne sabhi sadsy deshon ko ek chitthee likhi ki use apana pregentation dikhaane kii ijaajat di jaae
 In the NSG meeting, China strongly opposed this and said that there was no consensus on India's membership, so there should be no presentation
 vahaan maujuud ek bhartiya adhikari ne ise ''saanp-chhachhundar jaisi sthiti bataaya
 We could not start this process until it became consensual and could not work to build consensus from the start of the process
 " haalanki baithak se alag australia ne china ke virodh kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr ek aayojan kiya jisamen bharat ne apni pregentation di
 In 48, 24 member countries were agreeable, the foreign ministry team returned to Delhi, and it took a review of the position of 48 members
 unke akalan main 24 to rajamand the lekin baaki sadsy yaa to maun the yaa phir sadsyta ke liye koi shart lagaana chaahate the
 Only a handful were seen opposing it
 bharat ke daawey ke liye saadhaaran bahumat hi kaaphi nahin tha
 Every decision in the NSG is taken by consensus and any proposal can be stalled by opposition from one member
 isliye videsh mantralay ne sabhi enesji sadasyon ke paas sachiv str ke adhikariyon ko doot banaakar bheja
 The strategy of negotiation was made
 It was also decided that Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Prime Minister should be asked to talk to some heads of state and ministers themselves
 is tarah swaraj ne khud 26 deshon ke videsh mantriyon se baat kii
 The Prime Minister spoke to 12 heads of state and ministers
 iske alaava, unhone ireland, switzraland or mexico jaise deshon ke daure tay kiye
 So that they can garner support for India's NSG claim there
 modi ne daanv itnaa ooncha kyon kar liya? is aalochana ke jawaab main ek adhikari kehete hai, ''yah kahana jaij nahin he ki pradhanmantri ne prachaar ke liye baari taam-jhaam kiya
 They go two steps ahead for the good of the country
 "PAK ne bhi pesh kii daavedaari10 may ko jaishankar ne aupchaarik rup se enesji ke adhyaksh grosi ke saamne bharat kaa 300 panne kaa enesji sadsyta kaa aavedan pesh kiya or aagrah kiya ki tseol main 20-24 june ko vaarshik sacvamelan main is par gaur kiya jaae
 a fortnight later Pakistan also submitted its formal application for NSG
 jaahir he, pakistan ko china kaa samarthan tha
 But unlike India, Pakistan had no qualification to show that it was a responsible member of the nuclear fraternity
 uske aalaa parmaanu vaigyanik e
 Why
 khan par parmaanu rahasy uttar korea or iran ko bechney ke aarope hai
 Unlike India, it has not separated military and civilian nuclear plants or has not complied with the necessary regulations of the IAEA
 pakistan ke enesji ke liye aavedan ko baaki sadasyon ne bharat ke daawey ko rokane ke liye china kii koshish kaa hissaa mana
 India knew that it had to fight a long battle
 china bharat ko rokane ke liye kisi bhi had tak jane ko taiyaar tha
 Why is the 2016 effort different from the NSG success of 2008? The Modi government's "arbitrary" approach to NSG membership claims is being criticized and contrasted with Manmohan Singh and his team's "silently" gaining support
 It is being observed
 aisa nahin he ki upie-1 ke dauraan chhot hasil karne ke liye koi ho-hallaa nahin hua
 At that time there was a lot of opposition from the allies and eventually the left parties parted ways
 unhone pradhanmantri par america kaa pitthu hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 China had a different attitude in 2008 China still opposed India but not so openly
 2008 main china ne bharat se akele main kaha tha ki agar bharat duusare sadasyon kaa samarthan hasil kar letaa he to vah virodh nahin karegaa
 At that time, the pan was bent because George Bush had spoken to Hu Jintao and urged India's support
 shi sarkaar ne badali ranneetiakhir 2008 se china ke liye maamla kya badal gaya? ek to 2016 main china kaa ravaiya kuch alag ho gaya he
 Xi Jinping laid the foundation for a strong foreign policy after taking over from Hu Jintao in 2013
 hu ke daur kii chaturaai or saavdhaanee kii baaten ab biit gayi
 This is more openly about China's relationship with America
 shi kii kootneeti kaa kendriya tatv america ke saath ek nae tarah kaa taqatvar rishta kaayam karnaa he
 This means that China now sees both countries at par
 china ab america ke saamne is tarah khadaa hone ko taiyaar he jaisaa pehle nahin hua karata tha or america kii china par ab waisi nahin chalati jaisi pehle chalaa karti thi
 India needs to understand this change
 aakraamak china se nipatane kii ranneetichin main kai log aaj bhi us faisle se khush nahin hai ki 2008 main usne america ke dabaav main bharat ko enesji se chhot dene ke liye sahmati jataa di
 "in 2008, the United States tried hard and finally managed to get a special concession to India," Zhao Gancheng, senior strategic specialist, director of South Asia Studies, Shanghai Institute for International Studies, told India Today
 kya aaj bhi aisa sambhav he? main yakeen se nahin kah saktaa
 "the Indian team was aware of new international truths and did more than just trust America
 use yah bhi pataa tha ki is baar uskaa saamana aakraamak china se he
 Which is not capable of affecting the international system but can impose hindrance
 pakistan ke saath khadaa he chinachin kii kootneeti kaa doosraa bada badlaav yah he ki vah apane ''sadabahaar" dost pakistan ke liye kisi bhi had tak jane ko taiyaar dikhataa he
 He no longer seems to be trying to balance relations with India
 beijing main, pakistan ko china kaa ekmaatr dost bataaya jane laga he
 In a few years after Xi took over the reigns, China's state media has started calling Pakistan a "ba tie" or a "best friend"
 shi ne pakistan main ek aarthik coridor banane ke liye apni mahatvakankshi silk root pahal ko kendriya maamla bana liya he
 Under this, he has plans to build a corridor from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for road and energy projects despite opposition from India
 bharat ke liye sabase chintaa kii baat yah he ki kareeb ek dashak baad pehali baar china kii nitiyaan pakistan ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaai jane lagi hai
 Says a senior diplomat, "ironically, when we started looking at China and Pakistan separately, China connected us with Pakistan
" " enesji ke maamle main bhi yah jaahir he
 President Pranab Mukherjee was asked to seek cooperation from Xi during his visit in the last week of May to gain support from the ongoing talks with China
 unke saath gaye jaishankar ne bhi chini videsh sachiv or videsh mantri se baat kii
 China is said to have said
 ki ''ham bharat ke enesji sadsyta ke maamle main khul nahin sakate, lekin band bhi nahin hai
 "after that, a few days before the NSG meeting in Seoul, the Foreign Secretary made a secret visit to Beijing, which India Today is revealing for the first time
 kehete hai, china ne jaishankar se kaha, ''ham bharat ke bare main sakaaratmak rukh apnaane ko taiyaar hai
 But this cannot be done only in the case of India in the long run
 " china kaa rukh aspasht thah ham tumhen pravesh dilaa denge lekin tum pakistan ko pravesh dilaane main adnga mat lagaana
 China's concern was that India would impose a barrier to Pakistan after gaining entry into the NSG
 bharat ke liye tha behatar maukabharat ke liye yah ek mauka tha
 Modi's team was sure that if the doors are opened for the entry of NSG, there are plenty of opportunities for India
 unhen yah bhi ehsaas tha ki apane kharaab record kii vajah se pakistan ke pravesh kii tab tak gunjaaish nahin he, jab tak ki vah apane maamle saaf nahin kar letaa
 In addition, some countries have shown that it is better to curb Pakistan's nuclear ambitions by giving them a NSG membership
 bharat kii sadhi hui pratikriysaliye tseol main enesji kii baithak se ek din pehle dilli main apane vaarshik samvaadadaata sammelan main swaraj ne jor dekar kaha, ''china enesji kii sadsyta main bharat ke aade nahin aa rahaa he
 He is just talking about conditions and procedure
 mujhe ummid he ki ham china ko apni enesji sadsyta ke samarthan ke liye manaa lenge
 "as far as the application of Pakistan is concerned, he said that India is not a member yet, so cannot say anything
 lekin unhone yah bhi saaf kiya, ''ham enesji main kisi bhi desh ke pravesh main andgha nahin lagaayenge
 "and" every country should be considered on the basis of its eligibility
 "china adngebaaji kaa maamalajab jaishankar or videsh mantralay main parmaanu maamalon ke prabharee sanyukt sachiv amandeep singh gil enesji ke purna adhiveshan ke liye tseol kii udaan bhar rahe the, unhen pakkaa bharosa tha ki agar china ne apana vaada nibhaayaa to bharat paar nikal jayega
 But they were leaving no stone unturned
 unhone enesji ke sadasyon ko paanch samoohon main baant liya tha
 The original group was of the support countries, including the US, Russia, Japan, Canada, Britain, Germany and Australia
 ye desh na sirf bharat kaa samarthan karne ke liye balki dusron ko bhi saath aane ko manaane ke liye taiyaar the
 Then there was the "much larger supporter group", which consisted of Eastern Europe, Central Asia and some countries in Western Europe like Netherlands and Belgium
 kul milakar 48 main se kul 38 desh in donon samooh main aa gaye the
 Six countries, including Brazil, Switzerland and Turkey, were in the third group out of the remaining 10 countries that were in favor of following the standard
 ye ve desh the jinka bharosa us cheez main tha jise ''naram prakriya" kaha gaya
 These countries were ready to support India in the meeting provided that the criteria for enrolling non-npt members like India and Pakistan in the NSG simultaneously is agreed
 chathe samooh main teen desh the—austria, newjiland or ireland
 They were placed in the food of countries that wanted a "strict process"
 ve bharat kii sadsyta ke khilaaf nahin the magar sahi silsilaa tay karwaanaa chaahate the
 He said that the criterion or criteria should be fixed first and then only the Indian or any other application should be considered
 china kaa virodh bilkul alag or anokhaa tha or isliye use 1 ke samooh main rakhaa gaya tha
 He was ready but only when the application for Pakistan is also considered
 lekin ek din ke bheetar hi jab china ne dekha ki enesji ke bahut hi kam maatr kuchhek sadsy hi pakistan ke maamle par vichaar karnaa chaahate hai, to usne apana rukh badal liya
 China came down on the direct impediment in the words of an Indian officer, changed from "linkage to blockage"
 yani ab vah kisi or cheez se jodakar virodh karne ke bajaae sidhaa adnga lagane par utar aayaa
 China first resorted to procedural handouts and told the president (now commanded by South Korea) that India's application was not on the agenda, so it could not be discussed
 bharat ke himachati deshon ne palat waar kiya or adhyaksh ko charchaa ke liye raji hone par majaboor kar diya
 After this, China took the bet that overturned India
 mana jaataa he ki china ne ek maarak faisla paarit karne ke liye dakshin korea ko raji kar liya
 And that decision was that India's application would be discussed but there would be no decision in it
 china ko saadhane kii koshishen jariadhyaksh ne jaise hi in niyamon kaa faisla sunaaya, bharat jaanata tha ki is daur main uske daakhile kii sambhaavnaaen takreeban shunya ho gai hai
 Yet, in his meeting with Xi at the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, Modi played a high stakes by requesting the NSG to consider India's case in a "fair" and "objective" manner
 
 bharat ne ummid nahin chodi heis bich koi faisla na hote dekh bharat kaa samarthan karne kaa vaayada kar chuke kuch deshon ne gaiyr-enpiti sadasyon ko daakhil karne kaa maapdand tay karne kii baat rakhi
 China cited this as saying that it indicated opposition from other members
 lekin bharat ne ummid nahin chodi he
 Jaishankar from India Today said, "the door is open and we will continue on this path
" " jaishankar kii ummiden kaayam hai ki bharat ko enesji kii sadsyta mil jaaegi
 He says, "we will continue to use our powers of reason and prudence and persuasion to gain the support of NSG member countries, including China
" / p>—saath main anant krishnan, beijing main China did what was already anticipated
 usne apana vaada todakar bharat kii peeth main khanjar bhonka he
 It is not even a quarter of a month since the agreement on Doklam that he wrote a tale of deception
 28 agast ke samjhaute ko todakar usne doklam ke paas baari sankhya main sainikon kii tainaati kar daali he
 China's vulture sight had not yet vanished from Myanmar's Doklam plateau
 usne sainikon ko peeche hataane kaa samjhauta karke iskaa bhram paidaa kiya tha
 China either does not understand or does not think or is not ready to improve
 khayr jo bhi ho, lekin antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa jitna mazaaq usne udaaya he, vah duniya ke liye ek misaal he
 After Modi's visit to Beijing, the dragon came back in color, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Beijing, China has regained its old color
 china ne pichley maheene hi kiya gaya apana vaada tod diya he
 He promised that India and China would repel their troops and not interfere in Doklam again
 lagata he ki china ek baar phir se bharat ke sabar kaa imtihaan lene par amada he
 China has not only re-deployed its troops in Doklam, but their number is steadily increasing
 pichhali baar 73 din tak chali thi tanataneis ilaake main 73 dinon tak bharat or china kii senaaon ke bich tanatani chali thi
 Prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China on August 28, the two countries had promised to settle the military dispute under an agreement, but China has put a dagger in the back of that promise
 brihaspativaar ko hi PM modi ne kiya tha doklam kaa zikrapradhanmantri ne brihaspativaar ko hi apane bhaashan ke daurandoklam vivadako sulajhane ko lekar apni peeth thapthapai thi
 He had said that some people are spreading disappointment over the Doklam episode
 haalanki hakeekat yah he ki china doklam main sadaken bana rahaa tha or vah isko harhaal main puraa karnaa chahta he
 He had removed all the equipment and started work, but the soldiers of India had stopped all the work
 dragon ne di thi yuddh tak kii dhamkeemaamle ko lekar donon deshon ke sainik aamane-saamne aa gaye the or iske baad tanaav badhata chalaa gaya tha
 This situation was maintained for 73 days
 alag-alag tareeke se china ne bharat par peeche hatane ke tamaam dabaav banaae
 He even threatened India with war
 saath hi saal 1962 kii haar kii bhi yaad dilaai
 The pla's strength was also threatened, but India kept blowing it in the air without saying anything
 aakhirkaar ek sharmnaak sthiti main china ko bharat ke saath peeche hatane kaa samjhauta karnaa padaa, lekin yah samjhauta asal main ek dhokhaa tha, jo ab khulkar saamne aa gaya he
 India Alerts from China's antics India’s ears have been raised by seeing the movements of China
 abhichin ne dokalampar lagbhag 500 sainikon ko tainaat kiya he
 India has also started preparing for retaliation, but this deception of China is a big blow for us
 wo bhi itani jaldi
 Because China has not even given a thought to what it wants and whether it really wants to move on the path of military confrontation? What is the matter that both Bhutan and China refer to the Doklam area
 bharat kahata he ki doklam bhutan kaa he or bhutan kii raksha hamaari jimmedaari
 India supports Bhutan on this issue and has made it clear that it will not tolerate any construction that allows China to reach Chicken Neck, which is located just south of Doklam
 china kii isi chaal ke khilaaf bharat ne apni sena utaari thi
 Although he had to withdraw his army after two and a half months of heavy trouble, Beijing seems to have forgotten that insult
 is masale par ek baat to tay he ki china ko phir se sharmindagi jhelni padegi
 India and Pakistan are not only neighbors to each other, but are also healthy rivals in many respects
 aksar donon deshon ke raajnneetik halaat kii tulana hone par bharat ke paksh main majboot loktantr kaa hawala diya jaataa he, par ek maamle main pakistan ab bharat ko peeche chhodane vaala he
 India is going to have general elections in 2019 and Pakistan in 2018
 haalanki, kaha ja rahaa he kibharat main 2018 ke antim main bhi chunaav ho sakate hai
 Currently, both countries are currently working to give voting rights to their NRI voters and in this case India can lag behind its neighboring country Pakistan
 bharat main jahaan enarai ke liye 'proxi voting system' kaa intjaam kiya ja rahaa he, vahiin pakistan main iske liye atyaadhunik software taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The 'proxy Voting System' is not new to us
 hamaare desh main suraksha balon main karyrat jawan do tareekon se matdaan kar sakate hai
 They take a print of ballot paper, vote for the party or candidate of their choice and send their votes through post
 iske alaava yah karmchaaree apane kisi rishtedaar ko apana niyamit proxi voter bhi chun sakate hai
 As long as the soldier remains in the army, this proxy voter will continue to vote through him
 enarai ke liye philhal bharat main voter ke rup main panjikrut hona jaruri he or voting ke liye apane nirvachan kshetra main aana jaruri he
 At present, only a few NRI voters from Kerala are registered
 ab sarkaar enarai ko yah adhikaar dene vaali he, jisase vah apane rishtedaar ko proxi voter chun saken
 However, nris have to choose a proxy voter every time they vote
 bharat sarkaar ne is sambandh main november 2017 main supreme court main ho rahi sunwaayee main sansad main bill pesh karne ko 12 hafte kaa samay maanga tha
 At the same time, in Pakistan, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) and the Pakistan Election Commission (ECP) are working together to create software that will enable Pakistanis living abroad to vote easily in general elections
 donon sansthaaon ne pakistan ke supreme court main kaha he ki videshon main based 80 lakh pakistaniyon ko aasaan voting adhikaar dene kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 According to the website of Pakistani newspaper Dawn, the chairman of NADRA Usman Mobin has said that the software is currently being developed and the Election Commission is also aware of it
 unhone kaha he ki iskaa mock chunaavon main prayog kiya ja saktaa he or april main aam chunaavon ke liye yah taiyaar ho jayega
 They have asked for 10 weeks to prepare this software
 iske jariye voting ke liye videshon main based pakistaniyon ko paak duutavas main janaa hoga
 Chief Justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar has said that it will be a gift for Pakistanis
 vaise, pakistan main pehle bhi aisa software banane kii koshish hui thi, par vah amal main nahin laayaa gaya

 gautam gambhir ne cricket ke maidan par desh ke liye ahm yogadan diya he
 Where he has been a successful opener from India
 gambhir apane bedauf or aakraamak andaaz ke liye jane jate hai
 Young people like this style very much
 unhen ek eemaandaar cricketer or insaan ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 On this subject, Delhi's young man Apurva Bhatnagar says that Gambhir should not have entered politics, because his cricket career has been very clean and white, but everyone knows about politics that there is no way to go straight here
 disambar 2018 ko gambhir ne cricket ke sabhi formet se sanyas le liya tha or cricket ko alavida kehane ke baad se hi gautam gambhir ne desh ke ahm muddon par apni pratikriya dene ke saath-saath raajnneeti main ruchi lenaa bhi shuru kar diya tha
 However, according to Gambhir, the only reason for his arrival in politics is country service, as he believes that he has chosen BJP politics only because of the honesty and service of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 jahaan kuch log gambhir ke is faisale kii aalochana bhi kar rahen hai ki ek cricketer ko raajnneeti main nahin aana chaiye, to vahiin kuch log gambhir ke is faisle ke paksh main khadey dikhaai die
 On this subject, youth Shailendra said that "this is a good sign, we should welcome him
" unhonen cricket main acha prardashan kiya he to raajnneeti main bhi acha kar sakate hai
 They should get a chance, not just criticize that if they are coming into politics as a cricketer then they will not be able to do well ”

 In such a situation, even though he has been a veteran and successful cricketer, he may face a lot of challenges on the political pitch

 sabase pehle mamata banerjee ne sonia gandhi se milane ke baad congress ummidavaaron ke naamon ko saarvajanik kar diya
 But Mamta did not tell the media that on behalf of the Trinamool, she had mentioned only one name of Somnath Da
 congress ko is par safai dene main 16 ghante lag gaye tab tak rajnatik galiyaaron main na jane kya kya kayaas lagaae gaye
 Among the three nominees for Mamata and Mulayam, the most shocking name was that of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 mamata ne ek hi saath sonia gandhi, manmohan singh or pranab mukherjee teenon ko haisiyat dikhaa di
 Apparently the trio were angry with numbness and insults
 halaki raajnneeti kii nabj samajhane vaale logon ko manmohan singh kaa naam chakit nahin kar rahaa tha
 Most of the mps in Congress were saying in suppressed language that Manmohan Singh should be sent to Raisina Hill and Pranab or Rahul Gandhi should be made Prime Minister
 magar yah ho na sakaa
 It is also being said that there is a big lobby in the country that wants to see Pranab Mukherjee out of the Finance Ministry
 yah bijness lobby he
 And it is also being said that the new finance minister is about to reverse the government's decision on Vodafone
 congress ne saaf kiya ki manmohan singh 2014 tak pradhanmantri bane rahegein
 Come on, something was clearly said on behalf of the party
 ab manmohan singh ke jane or rahul gandhi ke aane par kayaas lagane band ho jaaenge
 Now real politics begins
 
 
 jis din mamata or mulaayam singh saajha press coffrence karte hai usee din saadhe 11 baje raat ko sonia gandhi or mulaayam singh kii mulaakaat hoti he or vah congress ummidavaar ko samarthan dene kaa vaada sonia gandhi se karte hai
 Now the question is how did Mulayam overturn Mamata in six hours
 kushti ke maahir khilaadi mulaayam singh raajnneeti main bhi kabhi chit to kabhi pat main yakeen rakhte hai
 If the press club's gossip is to be believed, then the DA case file was shown to Mulayam Singh
 tab kisi kii theory he ki pranab da ke paksh main ek bada audyogic gharaana kaaphi sakriy hua
 While the other side connected to the same is very close to Mulayam
 or yaheen se dabaav bana or netaji dhobi pachhad main haar gaye or madam ke saamne raat ke andhere main pichley daravaaje se hajir kiye gaye
 The news was leaked only two days later
 raajnneeti main sam, dand, bhed sabakaa istemaal karnaa congress se acha koi nahin jaanata
 Now Mamta remained adamant in the name of Kalam alone
 darasal jaise hi mamata−mulaayam ne kalam, manmohan or somnath da kaa naam liya tha congress ko maano saanp soongh gaya tha
 The leaders' mobiles were switched off
 pranab da jab us raat apane daftar se nikle to udhaas or khamosh dikh rahe the
 None of us dared to ask anything
 yadi sutron kii maane to pranab da ne usee raat congress alaakaman ko yah jataa diya tha ki party ne unke naam kaa samarthan nahin kiya to vah raajnneeti ke saath-saath saarvajanik jivan se bhi sanyas le legein
 Then the party came into action
 kai log 13 talkatoraa road kii taraf bhaage
 Pranab da was celebrated and mobiles of many important leaders were turned on
 khabaren aane lagi ki congress pranab da ke naam kii ghoshnaa karegi or yah sab raat ke dhai baje ho rahaa tha
 The next day, Pranab da met Sonia Gandhi at 10 pm and then reached a cabinet meeting where two presidential candidates were face to face
 yani manmohan singh or pranab mukherjee
 Soon after, Sonia Gandhi called a UPA meeting
 sivaae mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress ke sabhi sahyogi maujuud the
 Sonia Gandhi announced Pranab da's name and Pranab da was greeted by TR Baalu with a shawl
 pranab da jab vitt mantralay pahunche to vahaan mithai bant rahi thi
 Sugar free sweets were ordered for Dada and Barfi and Laddu for journalists
 kaaphi gahamagahami thi pranab da ko lagaataar phone aa rahe the jisamen adhiktar mukhyamantri, rajyapal or dada ke kolkata ke puraane dost the
 Some phones were coming on land line and some on mobile
 dada kaa mobile unke sahyogi praduyat guha ke paas tha
 He caught Manoranjan Bharti of Mobile NDTV, that mobile had 68 missed calls and 64 unrated messages for Pranab da
 puraa media pranab da ke parivaar ke peeche padaa tha
 His daughter Sharmitha said that she is sad that a party from Bengal did not give its support to the most capable candidate of Bengal
 ishara mamata kii taraf tha
 Dada's wife said that all is a game of luck and when Pranab Mukherjee came out of his office, thanked everyone and also appealed to sister Mamta Banerjee to support him
 is tarah pichley 48 ghante tak chalaa rajnatik naatak par thodi der ke liye interval ho gaya

 antarrashtriya nishanebaaj or youth olympic main shooting main gold jeetne vaali manu bhaakar kii puraskaar raashi ko lekar jari vivaad ke bich ab haryana sarkaar kii ore se jawaab aayaa he
 While Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has said that Manu will definitely get the prize money, Sports Minister Anil Vij has advised that only focus on sports
 haalanki, siem khatter ne bhi kaha he ki twit karne kaa tarika sahi nahin he
 After winning the gold at the Youth Olympics-2018, the 16-year-old Manu was promised a cash prize of Rs 2 crore by the state government, which the shooter has not yet received
 bataa den kimanu bhaakar ne twitor par hi poocha he ki kya yah ghoshnaa sahi thi yaa phir jumala tha
 In fact, Manu Bhaker won the gold medal in shooting at the Youth Olympic Games held in Buenos Iris, about three months ago last year, when he was announced a reward of two crore rupees by the Haryana government
 lekin us elaan ke qareeb teen maheene baad inaam nahin milane se naaraaz 16 saal kii manu ne khel mantri anil vij se sawaal poocha or raashi kii maang kii, to is par mantri ji naaraaz ho gaye or unhone manu ko khel par dhyaan dene kii naseehat di
 The Sports Minister said that Manu should have talked to the Sports Ministry first and not the tweet
 haalanki unhone vaade ke mutabik inaam dene kii baat doharaai he
 In addition to the Youth Olympics last year, Manu also won a gold medal in the Commonwealth Games and Shooting World Cup
 Sir Please confirm if it is correct
 
 
 Or just Jumla

 Bhaker should feel sorry for creating this controversy
 She has a long way to go
 She should focus on her game only

 When he was asked about his future move by some people seeking his resignation from the post of WBHRC chairman while others supported him, he said, "there is no time to think about it
" darasal, bhaajapa netaa sushamaa swaraj ne somvaar raat nyaayamurti ganguli ke istife kii maang karte hue kaha tha, na keval sijar kii patni balki sijar ko bhi andeh se pare hona chahie
 Recently, when Supreme Court Chief Justice Altamas Kabir was asked whether Justice Ganguly should resign from the post of WBHRC President, he said, no one simply resigns automatically on the basis of allegations

 The RJD leader (tejashwi Yadav) urged opposition leaders to take a "united and collective" stance against this campaign of news channels
 tejasvi ne is babat beete 8 march ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, basapa pramukh mayawati, samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ko likhe patr ko apane twitor acount par saajha karte hue kaha, ‘‘saathiyon! ek taraf jahaan ham bhukhmaree, berogari, kisaan or saamaajik nyaay se jude mudde uthaa rahe hai vahiin mukhyadhara kii media kaa ek bada varg bhaajapa mukhyalay dwaara tay agenda ke tahat in sarokaaron par pardaa daal rahaa he

 "he wrote," In any debate it is expected that the opposition parties will also be able to give their opinion on any issue
 lekin jis tarah se bahes ko aage badhaayaa jaataa he, usamen saaf dikhataa he ki unka jhukaav sirf ek party ko phayda pahunchane kii taraf he
 "in such a situation, i do not think that there is any scope for a fair debate on these news channels," wrote Tejashwi
 in bahason main vipakshi netaaon kii maujuudagi sirf is vajah se rakhi jaati he, jisase ki ve apni jhooth par farji vishwasaneeyata kaa pardaa daal saken
 Many senior journalists have also told me that the standards of journalism in such channels have been completely ignored
 ''rajd pramukh lalu prasad ne bhi apane twitor handle par tejasvi ke is patr ko saajha kiya he
 BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said in response to Tejashwi's tweet, "remember the days when the public broadcaster used to call the people of the country as 'indira Darshan' and 'rajiv Darshan'

 While issuing the new fiscal year credit policy, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel has made it clear that the credit policy issued is not for the interest rates in the country, without making any change in the repo rate
 urjit patel ne apni credit policy ke jariye arthvyavastha ke saamne khadi 5 badi chunautiyon kaa zikr kiya
 The most important of these challenges is the farmer loan model put forward by Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi in Uttar Pradesh, which the RBI is calling a serious challenge
 RBI credit policy ke mutabik ye hai 5 badi chunautiyaan
 1
 kisaan karj maafee se kharaab hogi desh kii credit vyavasthauttar pradesh sarkaar kii karj maafee yojana se samasya main fanse kisaanon ko keval alpakaaleen raahat milegi lekin isse kharaab rin samskruti ko badhaava milegaa or rajya ke vitt par asar padegaa
 BJP government in Uttar Pradesh 2
 15 karod laghu evam seemaant kisaanon ko 1,00,000 rupee tak ke krishi rin ko maaf kar diya he
 This led to 307 on the state's finances
 29 arab rupee kaa boj aayega
 Apart from this, 56 to 7 lakh farmers to the government
 30 arab rupee ke karj ko gaiyr-nishpadit parisampatti ko batte khate main daal diya
 2

 The RBI estimates that most of the states will also start giving allowances to their employees at the same rate after the allowance at the rates proposed by the Pay Commission is validated from the beginning of the current financial year
 iske chalate vitt varsh ke dauraan mahangaai dar ummid se 1 se 1
 May be 5 percent more
 3
 The rising fear of el-nino and weak monsoon The Reserve Bank has expressed fear in its monetary review that the threat to el-nino is looking to be serious this year, which is likely to keep the monsoon weak
 gauratlab he ki 2016 main achche monsoon ne kai saal se desh main kharif fasal main ho rahe nuksaan kii bharpai kii thi
 But once again, the forecast of a weak monsoon by the Meteorological Department is a big challenge for the central bank

 The risk of the price of crude oil going above $ 60, will be dangerous, inflation will be at its lowest level in the international market for the last 3 years
 iskaa sidhaa asarkendra sarkaar ke khajanaper padaa or desh kaa rajkoshiya ghaataa kaabo main aa gaya
 But due to the agreement of OPEC countries in the last few months, crude oil has once again crossed the $ 50 per barrel level
 rigerv bank kaa aankalan he ki agle kuch maheene main kachche tel kii keemat 60 dollar prati bairal kaa str paar kar legi to desh main mahangaai kaa asar saaf taur par dikhne lagegaa

 This video is before Siddharth Shukla's Big Boss, where he is telling about his favorite thing in the world
 a post shared by Siddharth Shukla (@siddharth_shukla_fan_club) on Oct 26, 2019 at 6:43am pdtxaraasala, siddharth shukla is video main apni 8 ghante kii neend ke bare main baat kar rahe hai jo inhen duniya main sabase pyaari he
 In the video, he is telling that Bigg Boss has not yet gone to the house, so he should be allowed to sleep for 8 hours
 aage wo kehete hai - 'agar mujhe 8 ghante kii neend nahin mili to meri band baj jaati he
 Therefore, nothing else can be found, sleep should be attained
 'bataa den, siddharth shukla aalia bhatta ke saath film 'hampti sharma kii dulhaniyaan' main kaam kar chuke hai
 Apart from this, he has played many popular characters on TV
 jaise - balika vadhu, pavitra rishta, fier factor - khataron ke khilaadi, dil se dil tak (is naatak main rashmi desai (rashami Desai) ke saath the), jhalak dikhalaa ja, karn sangini or dance diwane main dikh chuke hai

 In order to provide pure drinking water at affordable rates to the general public of urban areas in Chhattisgarh, the government approved to install 150 water atms in a dozen districts including Raipur
 nagar palika or nagar nigamon ne kuch chuninda ilaako main water atm sthapit bhi kar die
 This has been happening throughout the year but water is not coming out from the Water ATM
 ye water atm saal bhar se sho-pis ban kar rah gaye hai
 Apart from water connection, electricity connection has also not been found, because the Urban Administration Department did not clear who will pay the electricity bill of Water ATM
 natijatan sabhi 150 water atm sirf sadakon kii shobhaa badha rahe hai
 Thirsty people come close to him, but they do not know that the machine has stopped because of no electricity
 saal bhar se nahin mila bijli conectionchhattisgarh main garmi ke mausam ne dastak de di he
 Passengers have started getting dry
 ve thande pani kii talash main water atm kii ore nihaarte he, lekin unhen us vakt maayusi haath lagati he jab pataa chalata he ki saal bhar se ise bijli muhaiyaa karai hi nahin gai he
 In such a situation, thirsty citizens leave no stone unturned to curse the government
 jabaki sarkaar ne bhalee manshaa se logo ko shuddh peyajal muhaiyaa karaane kaa bandobast kiya tha
 The officers of the urban bodies provided a considerable budget to the urban bodies for purchasing the Phera Paniwater ATM machine
 lekin uski is kavayad par nagareey nikaayon ke prashasan ne hi pani pher diya
 Call it an officer's mistake or carelessness
 unhone water atm to vibhinn sthanon main laga diya, lekin mashiinon ko bijli conection muhaiyaa karaane kaa naa to koi bandobast kiya or naa hi koi disha nirdesh die
 In such a situation, the company providing water atms did its work
 usne niyat sthaan par water atm sthapit kiye or uskaa bill kaa bhugtan praapt kar rukhsat ho gai
 Water ATM machine has been attracting passers by many years in many cities
 is bare main jab afasaron ko dhyaan dilaayaa gaya tab pataa chalaa ki aakhir kyon water atm mashin thapp padi hai
 However, the officers who came into action warned the officials of Urban Administration Department about this
 ab jaakar vibhaag harakat main aayaa he
 The Urban Administration Department has made it clear that the water and electricity connection for the water atms should be taken in the name of the respective urban bodies, ie the municipality and the municipal corporation
 iske saath hi bijli conection ke liye demand note sambadhit seva pradaata yane thekedaar ke madhyam se bhugtan kiya jayega
 The department has taken correct steps by correcting the Le Water ATM but right now the department has taken correct steps
 usne nagareey nikaayon ke siemo ko patr likhakar nirdeshit kar diya
 It is expected that people will be provided cold water in this summer with a nominal fee

 To this, Modi said, 'we too have our own compulsions
 rajya sabha main kai bill paas nahin ho paa rahe
 'in response, Sisodia said,' Sir hope you will get majority in Rajya Sabha too
 haa agar let hoga, chaar saal baad ho paaegaa to bahut saare bade kaam aise hai jo samay se nahin ho paaenge
 Kejriwal said, 'your cooperation will be needed
 'modi ne kaha, 'sahyog rahegaa, shubhakamanaayen
 After this, he again shook hands
 kejariwal or manish kamare se baahar aa gaye
 The Prime Minister again sat in his chair
