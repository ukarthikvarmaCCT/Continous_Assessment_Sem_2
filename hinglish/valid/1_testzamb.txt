 prayikta siddhant or sankhyikee main, kisi sankhyikeey jansankhya, data set yaa prayikta vitaran ke prasaran ke vargamul ko maanak vichlan kehete hai
 Standard deviation is a widely used measure of scattering of how 'dispersed' the data is
 maanak vichlan bijganit kii drushti se adhik suvidhajanak he yadhyapi vyaavhaarik rup se pratyaashit vichlan yaa ausat nirpeksh vichlan kii tulana main yah kam sudrudh hota he
 This shows how much variation there is from the "average" here
 ise vitaran ke madhyamaan se ankon ke ausat antar ke rup main mana ja saktaa he ki ve madhyamaan se kitni dur hai
 a low standard deviation indicates that the data points are very close to the mean while a high standard deviation indicates that the data are spread over a very large range of values
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main vayask purushon kii ausat oonchai 70 inch he or iske saath hi saath inkaa maanak vichlan lagbhag 3 inch he
 This means that most males have a standard deviation - within 3 inches of the mean) while almost all males have a height of 2 inches (2 standard deviations) within the mean)
 yadi maanak vichlan shunya hota, to sabhi purush vastav main 70 inch oonche hote
 yadi maanak vichlan 20 inch hota, to purushon kii oonchaaiyon main bahut zyada antar, vishesh rup se lagbhag 50 se 90 inch hota

 In addition to expressing the variability of the population, standard deviations are typically used to measure the confidence of statistical inference
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek hi chunaav ko kai baar yojit kiya gaya ho to matdaan data kii truti seemaa ko parinaam ke pratyaashit maanak vichlan kii gananaa dwaara nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 The reported error range is typically approximately twice the standard deviation - equal to the radius of the 95% confidence interval

 The standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation of the return rate of an investment is a measure of investment volatility
 maanak vichlan sangya kaa sabase pehla prayog 1894 main karl pearson ke lekhan main kiya gaya or uske baad unke vyakhyanon main iskaa prayog kiya gaya
 It was used instead of initial alternative names expressing the same idea: Gauss used "mean error" as an example
 maanak vichlan kii ek upyogi visheshta yah he ki prasaran ke vipareet, ise data ke rup main ek hi ikaayiyon main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Note, however, that for measurements containing percent as a unit, the standard deviation will have percentage points as a unit

 Suppose the population has the following values: isamen kul aath data ank hai jiskaa madhyamaan maan 5 he: To calculate the standard deviation of the population, first calculate the difference of each data point from the mean and find the square of the result: uske baad in maanon ke yogafal ko aankadon kii sankhya se vibhajit karen or maanak vichlan gyaat karne ke liye inkaa vargamul nikaalen: Thus, the above example shows that the standard deviation of the population is 2
 uparokt udhaaharan ek sampoorn jansankhya kii kalpana he
 If 8 values are obtained by random sampling from some parent population, the sample will be divided by 7 instead of 8 in the calculation of standard deviation

 In the case where x derives random values from a finite data set x 1, x 2,


, x n { \ displaystyle x_ {1}, x_ {2}, \ ldots, x_ {N}} each value of Has the same probability, then the standard deviation is yaa, jod sanketan kaa prayog karne par, The standard deviation of the probability distribution is the same as the standard deviation of a random variable with the same type of distribution
 chunki in pratyaashit maanon kaa hona aavashyak nahin he, isliye sabhi yadrichhik parivartaneey main maanak vichlan nahin hota he
 For example, the standard deviation of a random variable that follows a Cauchy distribution remains defined because its expected value is undefined
 satat vitaran aam taur par vitaran ke maapdandon ke ek falan ke rup main maanak vichlan kii gananaa karne ke liye ek sutara pradaan karata he
 Generally, the standard deviation of a random variable x with a constant real value with probability density function p he jahaan And where the integral is the definite integral which is the assumed value of the x range over the range of x
 ek asatat yadrichhik parivartaneey kaa maanak vichlan, madhyamaan se iske maanon kaa mul-madhyamaan-varg vichlan hota he
 If the random variable x assumes the same probability n values x 1,


, x n { \ displaystyle \ textstyle x_ {1}, \ dots, x_ {N}}, then its standard deviation σ is calculated as follows can be done: is gananaa ko nimnlikhit sutara dwaara varnit kiya jaataa he: Where x ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ overline {x}}}, the value is the arithmetic mean of xi, which is defined as: yadi sabhi maanon kii prayikta samaan na ho, lekin maan xi kii prayikta pi ke samaan ho, to maanak vichlan kaa pariklan nimna prakaar se kii ja sakati he: where or N', gaiyr-shunya bhaar tatwon kii sankhya he
 The standard deviation of a data set is the same as the standard deviation of a discrete random variable that can methodically assume values from a data set where the point excess of each value is proportional to its plurality in the data set
 maan len, ham 3, 7, 7 or 19 maan vaale data set kaa maanak vichlan gyaat karnaa chaahate the
 Step 1: Find the arithmetic mean of 3, 7, 7 and 19, charan 2: madhyamaan se prayek sankhya kaa vichlan gyaat karen, Step 3: Find the square of each deviation, which increases the large deviations and converts the negative values to positive, charan 4: un vargit vichalnon kaa madhyamaan gyaat karen, Step 5: Take the non-negative square root of the quotient, to, samucchy kaa maanak vichlan 6 he
 This example also shows that, in general, the standard deviation is different from the mean absolute deviation
 dhyaan den ki yadi uparokt data set keval vrihattar jansankhya ke ek namoonay ko darshaae, to jansankhya ke maanak vichlan kaa akalan karne ke liye ek sanshodhit maanak vichlan kii gananaa kerani hogi jo is udhaaharan ke liye 6

 aise maamalon main jahaan aisa nahin kiya ja saktaa he, vahaan maanak vichlan σ kaa akalan jansankhya se liye gaye ek yadrichhik namoonay kaa pareekshan karke kiya jaataa he
 Some assessors are given below: kabhi-kabhi prayog kiye jane vaale σ kaa ek akalankarta, namoonay kaa maanak vichlan he jise s n dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he or jise nimna rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he: This estimator has the same small mean squared error as the "sample standard deviation" and is the maximum possible estimation when the population is normally distributed
 lekin yah akalankarta, jab ise ek chote yaa maamuli aakaar vaale namoonay main karyanvit kiya jaataa he, tab bahut kam ho jaataa he: yah ek pakshpaati akalankarta he
 The most common estimator of the σ experiment is an adjusted version, the sample standard deviation marked by "s" and defined as: jahaan { x 1 , x 2 , 


, x n } { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ {x_{1}, \ ,x_{2}, \ , \ ldots , \ ,x_{n} \ }}, namoona he or x ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ overline {x}}}, namoonay kaa madhyamaan he
 This rectification is known as the refinement of Bessel
 is sanshuddhi kaa kaaran yah he ki s 2, antarnihit jansankhya ke prasaran σ2 kaa ek nishpaksh akalankarta he, yadi vah prasaran maujuud ho or namoonay ke maan ko pratisthaapan ke saath swatantraapurvak taiyaar kiya gaya ho
 haalanki, s, maanak vichlan σ kaa ek nishpaksh akalankarta nahin he, balki yah jansankhya ke maanak vichlan ke nune-akalan main sahaayak he
 Note that the term "standard deviation of the sample" is used for the unstandard estimator while the term "sample standard deviation" is used for the unweighted estimator

 Although an unbiased estimator for σ is known when the random variable is normally distributed, the formula is complex and calculates a slight correction: see Unbiased estimation of standard deviation for more information
 Also, fairness is not always desirable: see the bias of an assessor

 ek bada maanak vichlan ingit karata he ki data ank madhyamaan se dur hote hai or ek laghu maanak vichlan ingit karata he ki ve madhyamaan ke chaaron-taraf kaaphi nazadiiki se samoohikrut hote hai
 For example, the median of each of the three populations {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} is 7
 unke maanak vichlan kramshah 7, 5 or 1 hai
 The standard deviation of the third population is less than the other two deviations because all of their values are close to 7
 ek aspasht arth main, maanak vichlan hamen yah bataata he ki data ke ank madhyam se kitini dur hone chahie
 isamen utani hi ikaiyaan hogi jitani swayan data ankon main hote hai
 For example, if the data set {0, 6, 8, 14} represents the age of a number of four siblings in years, the standard deviation is 5 years
 ek duusare udhaaharan ke taur par, jansankhya {1000, 1006, 1008, 1014} chaar athleton dwaara tay kii gai duriyon ko meter main vyakt karata he
 Its mean is 1007 meters and the standard deviation is 5 meters
 maanak vichlan, anischitata kii ek maap ke rup main kaary kar sakate hai
 For example, the reported standard deviation of a set of repeated measurements in physics should provide the precision of those measurements
 The standard deviation of those measurements is crucial when it is decided whether the measurements agree with the theoretical prediction: if the mean of the measurements is far from the prediction, the experimental theory probably needs to be refined
 isse yah arth nikalataa he ki ve maanon kii shrenee se baahar chale jate hai jiske hone kii uchit ummid kii ja sake yadi bhavishyavaanee sahi hoti or maanak vichlan maatr ko uchit dhang se nirdhaarit kiya jaataa

 The practical value of understanding the standard deviation of a set of values is subject to determination of how much variance is from the "average"
 ek saadhaaran udhaaharan ke rup main, shaharon ke ausat taapmaana par vichaar karen
 jabaki do shaharon kaa ausat taapmaana 15 °C ho saktaa he, yah samajhane main sahaayak he ki samudr tat ke paas ke shahar kii seemaa antardeshiy shaharon kii tulana main choti he jo yah spasht karata he ki jabaki ausat samaan he lekin samudr tat ke sameep kii apeksha antardeshiy bhinnata ke hone kii adhik sambhaavna he
 So, the average temperature of a city is 15 with a maximum temperature of 25 ° c and a low temperature of 5 ° c and the same happens with another city with a maximum temperature of 18 and a low temperature of 12
 The standard deviation allows us to recognize that the average of a city with wide variation and thus a high standard deviation will not provide as reliable a predictor of temperature as a city with less variance and a lower standard deviation

 haalanki, ek ucch maanak vichlan vaala team us prakaar team ho saktaa he jo bahut score banaata he lekin bahut chhot bhi dete hai, yaa ek duusare ke vipareet, jiskaa akraman karaab ho saktaa he lekin score karne main mushkilen paidaa kar isaki kshatipurti karata he
 Trying to predict which team will win on a given day requires focusing on the standard deviation of ratings of the various "stats" of the team under which inconsistency can match strength vs
 weakness in trying to understand Which factors can be strong indicators of the final scoring result

 In finance, standard deviation is a performance of the risk associated with a given security or the risk of a portfolio of securities
 jokhim yah nirdhaarit karne kaa ek mahatvapurn kaarak he ki kis tarah nivesh ke portpholio kaa kushaltapurvak prabandhan karnaa chahie kyonki yah aasti or / yaa portpholio ke pratifal kii bhinnata kaa nirdhaaran karata he or niveshkon ko nivesh ke faislon ke liye ek ganitiya aadhaar pradaan karata he 
 jokhim kii samgr avadharana yah he ki jab isamen vruddhi hoti he to arjeet jokhim premium ke parinamswaroop aasti ke pratyaashit laabh main vruddhi hogi – duusare shabdon main, niveshkon ko nivesh par adhik pratifal kii ummid kerani chahie jab kathith nivesh main ucch stareey jokhim ho yaa us pratifal kii anischitata ho
 niveshon ke moolyankan ke samay niveshkon ko pratyaashit pratifal or bhavishyat pratifalon kii anischitata donon kaa akalan karnaa chahie
 maanak vichlan, bhavishyat pratifalon kii anischitata kaa ek parimanit akalan pradaan karata he
 For example, suppose an investor had to select either of the two stocks
 stock a kaa pichley 20 varshon se ausat pratifal 10% tha jiskaa maanak vichlan 20 pratishat ank tha or stock b kaa usee samyavadhi main ausat pratifal kaa maan 12% tha lekin uske ucch maanak vichlan kaa maan 30 pp tha
 Depending on the risk and return, an investor may decide that Stock a is a more secure option because an additional 10 pp standard deviation of 2% points over Stock B's return has no value in front of it
 ek hi paristhitiyon main stock a kii apeksha stock b ke aarambhik nivesh main kai baar kami hone kii sambhaavna hoti he or ausatan keval 2% adhik pratifal praapt hone kaa akalan kiya jaataa he
 In this example, Stock a is expected to earn about 10%, 20 pp more or less, about two-thirds of future year's returns
 bhavishya main adhik se adhik sambhavit pratifal yaa parinaam par vichaar karne ke samay, ek niveshak ko 10% adhik yaa kam 60 pp, yaa 70% se 50% tak kii seemaa tak ke parinaam kii ummid kerani chahie jisamen ausat pratifal ke teen maanak vichalnon kaa parinaam shaamil hota he
 Calculating the average return of a security during a given time period will generate an expected return of the asset
 For each period, subtraction of the expected return from the actual return results in variance
 aasti ke samgr jokhim ke parinaam ke prabhaav ko gyaat karne ke liye prayek avadhi ke prasaran kaa varg nikaalen
 avadhi kaa prasaran jitna adhik hota he, pratibhuti utana hi adhik jokhim vahan karata he
 The average of the quadratic variances results in the measurement of the overall units associated with the asset
 is prasaran kaa vargamul gyaat karne ke parinamswaroop prashnadhin nivesh upkaran kaa maanak vichlan praapt hoga
 The population standard deviation is used to determine the width of Bollinger bars, a widely adopted technical analysis tool
 udhaaharan ke liye, upree bowlinger pattee ko nimna rup main diya jaataa he: To get some geometric insights, we will start with a population of three values, x 1, x 2, x 3
 It defines a digit in p = r 3
 maan len rekha l = { : r main r }
 yahi "mukhya vikarn" he jo utpatti sthal se hokar gujarata he
 If all three of our given values were equal, then the standard deviation would be zero and p would lie on L
 It is not unreasonable to assume that the standard deviation is related to the distance from p to L
 or vastav main yahi vishay he
 When moving vertically from p to line L, it collides with a point: jiskaa nirdeshaank un maanon kaa madhyamaan he jise lekar hamane shuruyaat kii thi
 Algebra shows little that the distance between p and r is provided by σ√3
 ek anuroop sutara n maanon kii ek jansankhya ke liye bhi vaid he; uske baad hamen r n main kaam karnaa he
 Standard deviation ek avlokan shaayad hi madhyamaan se dur kuch maanak vichalnon se adhik hota he
 Chebyshev's inequality emphasizes the following threshold for all distributions for which the standard deviation is defined
 or saamaanya taur par: The central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sum of several independent, identically distributed random variables leads to a normal distribution
 yadi koi data vitaran lagbhag saamaanya he to maanon kaa lagbhag 68% maan, madhyamaan ke 1 maanak vichlan ke bheetar, maanon kaa lagbhag 95% maan, do maanak vichalnon ke bheetar or lagbhag 99
7%, 3 maanak vichalnon ke bheetar hote hai
 This is known as the 68–95–99
7 rule or the empirical rule
 z ke vibhinn maanon ke liye, maanon ke pratishat jinke samamit antaraal main or uske baahar hone kii ummid he, is prakaar he: The percentage within the range is defined by the formula:% perc = erf × 50% + 50% data ke ek set ke madhyamaan or maanak vichlan ko aam taur par ek saath prativedit kiya jaataa he
 In a certain sense, standard deviation is a "natural" measurement of statistical scattering if the data center is measured in terms of mean
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki madhyamaan kaa maanak vichlan, anya kisi bindu se kam hota he
 The exact details are as follows: Suppose x 1, 


, xn are real numbers and define the function: kalan kaa prayog karne yaa varg ko puraa karne par, sambhawatah yah pataa chalata he ki σ kaa madhyamaan adwitiya rup se nunatam he: The coefficient of variation of a sample is the ratio of standard deviation to mean
 yah ek ayamarahit sankhya he jise ek duusare ke sameep madhyamaanon vaale jansankhyaon kii bich ke prasaran kii raashi kii tulana karne ke liye prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 The reason is that if you compare populations with the same standard deviation but with different mean, then the coefficient of variation will be higher for the population with lower mean
 Thus, in comparing the variability of the data, the coefficient of variation should be used with great care and is better if it is replaced with the help of another method
 yadi ham vitaran ke namoonay ke dwaara madhyamaan praapt karnaa chaahate hai to madhyamaan kaa maanak vichlan nimna dwaara vitaran ke maanak vichlan se sambandhit hota he Where n is the number of observations of the sample used to estimate the mean
 nimnlikhit do sutara, ek chaalu maanak vichlan ko pradarshit kar sakate hai
 a set of sums of three powers s 0,1,2 is calculated as xk, each calculated on a set of n values of x
 dhyaan den ki s 0, x ko shunya ghaat main viksit kar detaa he or chunki x 0 kaa maan hameshaa 1 hota he, isliye s 0, n kaa moolyankan karata he
 Given the result of these three current totals, the values s 0,1,2 can be used at any time to calculate the current value of the current standard deviation
 s j kii paribhaasha, do alag-alag charnon ko pradarshit kar sakate hai
 Similarly to the sample standard deviation, ek computer karyanvayan main, chunki teen s j yogafal adhik ho jate hai, isliye hamen round-of truti, ankaganit atipravaah or ankaganit anupravah par vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 The following method calculates the current sum method with fewer rounding errors: jahaan A, madhyamaan maan he
 or namoona prasaran: Standard deviation jab maan x i, ko asmaan bhaar wi ke saath bhaarit kiya jaataa he, to ghaat yoga s 0,1,2 main se prayek nimna prakaar se pariklan kiya jaataa he: And the standard deviation equations remain unchanged
 dhyaan den ki s 0 ab bhaaron kaa yoga he na ki n namoonon kii sankhya
 An incremental method with fewer rounding errors can also be implemented with some additional complexity
 bhaaron ke ek chaalu yoga kaa avashya pariklan kiya janaa chahie: And the places where 1 / i is used above must be installed by wi / Wi: antim vibhaajan main, And jahaan n, tatwon kii kul sankhya he or 'n, gaiyr-shunya bhaar vaale tatwon kii sankhya he
 If the weights are taken as 1 then the above formula becomes similar to the simple formulas given above
 gaiyr-ativyapee up-jansankhyaon ke maanak vichalnon ko nimna prakaar se jod sakate hai yadi prayek kaa aakaar or madhyamaan gyaat ho: And jahaan For example, suppose that the average height for an average American male is 70 inches and the standard deviation is 3 inches, and it is also known that the average American woman has a mean height of 65 inches and a standard deviation of 2 inches
 america vayaskon ke madhyamaan or maanak vichlan kii nimna prakaar se gananaa kii ja sakati he: For more common m non-overlapping data sets X1 through XM: or where yadi do ativyapee jansankhyaon ke aakaar, madhyamaan or maanak vichlan, jansankhyaon ke saath-saath unke pratichhedan ke liye gyaat hon, to sampoorn jansankhya ke maanak vichlan kii abhi bhi nimna prakaar se gananaa kii ja sakati he: And gaiyr-ativyapee up-namoonon ke maanak vichalnon ko nimna prakaar se jod sakate hai yadi prayek kaa vaastavik aakaar or madhyamaan gyaat ho: And jahaan For more common m non-overlapping data sets X1 through XM: or where yadi do ativyapee namoonon ke aakaar, madhyamaan or maanak vichlan, namoonon ke saath-saath unke pratichhedan ke liye gyaat hon, to namoonon ke maanak vichlan kii abhi bhi gananaa kii ja sakati he

 anamelomas Enamelomas is an abnormality of teeth in which enamel is found on some parts of the teeth where it should not be enamel
 It is found in the middle parts of the roots, which is also called the division of the teeth
 Enamelomas are most commonly formed from the Hertwig epithelium root sheath
 During enamelomas, tooth roots collapse at the time of tooth erosion, causing the upper surface of the roots to deteriorate so that the tooth cells and cementoblasts come into contact with the predetermination
 When dividing, the cementum starts to accumulate on the surface of the teeth, which is further converted into an enamelomas
 Sometimes the enamel appears on the surface of the teeth in the form of small droplets which are also called enamel pearls as it looks like pearl material beyond the enamel teeth
 In the case of enamelomas, sometimes the predetermined epithelium remains attached to the root sheath, The number of enamels is also known

 vikaas prashasan kii avadharana vikasshil deshon main lokprashasan ke tulanaatmak adhyayan kii sah-upaj he
 The term was first used by UL Goswami in 1955, but it gained formal recognition when the Comparative Administration Group of the American Public Administration Committee and the Comparative Politics Committee of the Social Science Research Council provided it with an intellectual foundation
 is avadharana ko lokapriy banane main fred dablyoo0 rigs, edward dablyoo0 vedenar, joseph lau0 polombar, albert watarsan aadi ke naam pramukh hai
 The concept of development administration is meaningful for the independent countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America after the Second World War
 apane aupniveshik shaskaon se swatantrata praapt karne ke uparaant in deshon main aviksit arthvyavastha se viksit arthvyavastha kii ore jane ke prayaas armbh kiye gaye
 Going through the course of development, these countries were called developing countries, in front of which there were many problems related to development
 unka pramukh kaary niojit parivartan dwaara saamaajik-aarthik badlaav laana tha
 Traditional public administration was concerned with the improvement of the administration system, hence the need was felt to develop a new form of public administration which would focus on the study of socio-economic and administrative problems of developing countries
 is prakaar, vikaas prashasan ke vichaar ko sankalpana kii gai
 During the 1950s and 1960s, public administration scholars expressed considerable dissatisfaction with nature about traditional approaches to public administration in which Western values were oriented
 vidwaanon ko soochna ke ek maatra aadhaar ke rup main amareeki anubhav par lok prashasan sambandhi adhyayanon kii atyadhik nirbharta se bhi asantosh tha
 Therefore, by this, it meant that the whole thing is judged by the American value system, in which the system of the Third World and communist countries has a value-laden idea
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad anek africa or asian desh swatantra ho gaye or ve saamaajik-aarthik, raajnneetik evam prashasnic vikaas ke vibhinn charnon main the
 Since the administration of these countries was essentially development oriented
 atah vidwaanon main in deshon ke prashasan kaa adhyayan karne kii utsukata panpi
 His study became virtually the study of development administration
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad ke yug main sanyukt raashtra sangh kii kai agenciyaan evam sanyukt rajya america or soviet sangh kii sarkarein in nae ubharate raashtra rajyon ko bharpoor takneekee sahaayta dene me jute gai
 The purpose of giving such assistance to these countries by the United States and the Soviet Union was to gain their support in the United Nations
 in prodyogic kaaryakramon main jute visheshgyon ne sheeghra hi mahasoos kar liya ki pashchimi deshon kii prashasnic sanrachanaayen evam siddhant in deshon ke liye bhi upyukt hon, koi aavashyak nahin he
 There was a need to study their governance mechanisms with a view to finding ways to enable them to make proper use of the aid given to these countries
 vikaas prashasan kii utpatti amareeki vyavharpoorak vigyaanon se hui he
 Encouraged by the behavioral revolution in political science, public administration also emphasized behavioral studies in the field of comparative public administration, which also meant the study of the role of administration in development administration
 yadhyapi unka uddeshy paristhiti par bal dete hue keval lok prashasan kaa adhyayan karnaa tha kintu iske kaaran swaabhaavik taur par vikaas prashasan ke bhi adhyayan hue
 Time and natural resources were severely lacking in Third World countries while their need for immediate and rapid socioeconomic development
 ye lakshya niskriy prashasan kii sahaayta se nahin praapt kiye ja sakate the jo band or yathasthitivaadee tha
 Hence the need for a governance mechanism that differs from the administrative structure of developed countries and thus the concept of development administration emerged
 vikaas prashasan kii vidwaanon dwaara di gayi kuch paribhaashaayen nimnlikhit hai- According to Prof
 Weidner, “development administration guides the organization for political, economic and social progress
 yah mukhya rup se ek karyonmukh env lakshyonmukh prashasnic pranali par jor detaa hai
 In relation to this, Prof
 Riggs stated that "development administration is concerned with the administration of programs, large organizations especially the systems of government, implementing policies and schemes for the achievement of development goals
 donald si0 stone kaa kahana he ki “vikaas prashasan nirdhaarit lakshyon kii prapti ke liye sanyukt prayaas ke rup main sabhi tattvon or sadhano kaa sammishran he
 Its goal is to achieve the pre-determined objectives of development within the prescribed time frame
 uparokt paribhaashaon main bhinnata ke baavjood bhi yah dekhte ko miltaa he ki vikaas prashasan lakshyonmukhi or karyonmukhi he
 After analysis of definitions, the following elements regarding development administration come up
 tadpi paramparaagat prashasan evam vikaas prashasan ke madhya mukhya vibhedak nimnlikhit hai- The two concepts are completely related to each other but different
 vikaas prashasan kaa arth vikaas kaaryakramon kii vyavastha he jabaki prashasnic vikaas kaa arth he ki prashaskeey tantra ko kushal, sakasham tathaa prabhavi bananaa
 The mechanism that is working for social welfare or literacy is development administration and to develop and make social welfare administration compatible with purpose is administrative development
 prashasnic vikaas keval vikaas prashasan tak simit nahin he
 The development of general administration will also be called administrative development
 udhaaharan ke taur par british shashan ke antargat police kii jo kaary paddati thi vah loktantr ke anukool nahin he
 Adapting it will be an administrative development
 pro rigs ke anusaar vikaas prashasan kaa viksit kiya janaa bahut jaruri he kyonki iske bina vikaas kaa lakshya praapt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Efficient administration cannot do development work
 saath hi prashaskeey vikaas ke liye aavashyak he ki paryaavaran kaa bhi vikaas kiya jaye kyonki prashasnic vikaas ko paryaavaran hi sarvaadhik prabhavit karata he
 There is a relationship of interdependence between development administration and administrative development
 vikaas prashasan main prashasan ke paaramparik upagamon kii tulana main kai laabhadaayak gun hai jaise- Development administration acts as a means of comprehensively analyzing the problems of development and necessary measures for their diagnosis
 iske purv vikaas evam kalyaan sarkari kaary-kshetra main nahin aate the
 Development administration is a very important fact in the development of public administration
 isane lok prashasan ke kshetra main lokaneeti, iskaa karyanvayan evam moolyonmukh laakar lok prashasan kii simaaon ko vistrut kiya he
 It has direct significance for working administrators and academics
 kyonki ve hi lok vikaas kii samasyaon evam vikaas prakriya dwaara utpann samasyaon main pratyaksh rup se uljhe hai
 Development administration has successfully attracted the attention of scholars towards the inadequacies of the Western model and proved their inadequacies in terms of development work
 atah isane tulanaatmak lok prashasan ke tulanaatmak adhyayanon ke saath-saath lok prashasan ke siddhant or vyavhaar kii sarviktaa par vichaar khandit kiya he
 Development administration also considers the influence of culture on the administrative system and hence emphasizes the synchronization and transition of political, economic and socio-cultural aspects of development
 pashchimi modelon kii aparyaaptta ko ujagar karte hue vyavhaaron prashasan unki prashasnic vidhiyon evam vyavhaaron kii aparyaanttaaon ko bhi ujagar karata he
 Since the Western model was no longer applicable to the East, development administration supports the development of indigenous administrative methods
 udhaaharan ke liye bharat ne vikaas kaa panchayat raaj mandal apanaaya he to uski apni vidhi he
 Development administration focuses on human factors of administration
 jinaki pehle upeksha kii ja rahi thi
 It is more democratic in the sense that it also encourages the flow of ideas from lower levels and people's participation in the development process, which is essential for the success of development administration
 vikaas prashasan sarkaar kaa kaaryaatmak pahalu he jo lakshyonmukhi hota hai vikaas prashasan keval janata ke liye prashasan nahin he balki yah janata ke saath kaary karne vaala prashasan he
 In short, development administration has the following characteristics: parivartansheel : vikaas prashasan kaa kendrabindu parivartanshiltaa he
 This change is social, economic and political
 vikasshil deshon main prashasan ko nirantar parivartanon ke daur se guzarana padataa he
 In this way, variability is a valuable capital of development administration with which it remains active
 vikasaatmak prakruti: phensod ne thik hi kaha he ki vikaas prashasan naveen sudhaaron tathaa abhinavkaranon par nirbhar karata he
 Its nature is to carry on developmental programs
 iskaa pramukh uddeshy saamaajik, aarthik or raajnneetik drushtikon se pichhade samaaj kaa vikaas karnaa he
 Development administration related to democratic values is keen on fulfilling people's aspirations
 saath hi vikaas prashasan prajatantrik mulyon se sambaddh rahata he, kyonki isamen maanav adhikaron or mulyon ke prati sammaan, janhit kaa uddeshy tathaa uttardaayitv kii bhaavana nihit rahati he
 Since development administration is related to the efforts made by the government administration and governmental efforts are connected with public welfare and democratic values, hence development is related to the efforts made by the administration and governmental efforts are connected with public welfare and democratic values, hence development Administration cannot be separated from democratic values
 aadhunikeekaran: vikasshil deshon ke vikaas ke liye aadhunik drushtikon apnaanaa aavashyak ho gaya he
 At the same time, development administration has to qualify itself to achieve the modern objectives of today
 iske liye prashasnic aadhunikeekaran ko badhaava dena padataa he
 Development administration derives standards and techniques from developed countries for administrative modernization
 prashasnic kushalta: kushalta prashasan kii safalataa kii kunjee he
 Administrative efficiency is given importance in development administration because in the absence of it, it is not possible to successfully achieve the objectives of development
 vikaas prashasan is baat ke liye nirantar prayatnsheel rahata he ki prashasnic vikaas ke madhyam se prashasan kii kaarykushalta main vruddhi kii jaye
 Economic Development: Economic development and development administration have a very important relationship
 prashasnic vikaas ke liye aarthik vikaas bhi aavashyak hai
 Various economic plans and development related programs of developing countries are implemented only with the cooperation of the Development Administration
 vikaas prashasan aise prashasnic sanghathan kii rachana karata he jo desh kii aarthik pragati ko sambhav banaata he tathaa aarthik vikaas ke liye maarg prashast karata he
 Economic plans are very important for the development of the nation and development administration plays an important role in implementing them
 parinamonmukhi: vikaas prashasan kaa parinamonmukhi hona isaki ek anya mahatvapurn visheshta he
 Development administration is expected to complete the works within the prescribed limits and the results will be good
 isamen parinaam ko adhik mahatva diya jaataa hai Development administration is a newly expanded branch of public administration
 iskaa janm vikasshil deshon kii nayi-nayi prashasnic yojanaon tathaa kaaryakramon ko lagu karne ke sandarbh main hua hai iske kshetra main lok prashasan ke ve sabhi kaary aa jate hai jo nitiyon, yojana, kaaryakramon ke nirmaan se sambandhit hai
 In short, all the activities in its area are those which are related to social, political, economic, industrial and administrative development and which are run by the government
 jis prakaar vikaas ke kshetra ko nirdhaarit karnaa sambhav nahin he, usee prakaar vikaas prashasan ke kshetra ko nirdhaarit karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Study of its area can be done under the following headings- posdcorb siddhanth : chunki vikaas prashasan lok prashasan kaa hi vistrut ang he isliye luther gulik dwaara pratipaadit posdcorb siddhanth vikaas prashasan ke kshetra ke liye praasangik he
 This word is made up of the following words: in sabhi siddhanton kii vikaas prashasan main aavashyaktaa padati he
 Administrative Reforms and Managerial Development: Both of these development are very important in administration, so more attention is given to administrative reforms and managerial development
 prashasan ke sanghathanon me hameshaa sudhaar kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 The main objective of administrative reform is to simplify complex tasks and processes and to formulate rules that can achieve maximum productive results by spending minimum labor and expenditure
 iske liye samay-samay par vibhinn ayog evam samitiyaan gathit kii jaati hai tathaa prashasnic sudhaar ke sambandh main inke prativedan maange jate hai
 Training for public servants: Development administration has to implement new schemes, specialization and complex administrative programs
 aise kaaryon ko sampann karne ke liye vikaas prashasan ko anukool lok sevakon kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 For this, public servants are sent to different types of specialized training institutes for training, where they are told about administrative problems and organizational management etc
 Thus training their public servants to adapt to the changed modern circumstances with the development Administration tax is an important task
 aadhunik prabandhkeey takanic kaa prayog : vikaas prashasan kaa ek mahatvapurn kaary un naveen prabandhkeey takneekon kii khoj karnaa he jinase vikaas kaaryakramon main kaarykushalta badhaayi ja sake
 In this regard, new management methods adopted in developed countries should be implemented
 vikaas ke kaarykram : jaisaa ki vidit he, vikaas prashasan kaa ek mahatvapurn kaary gramin evam shahari vikaas ke kaaryakramon ko lagu karnaa he
 Many plans and programs are implemented for developing countries like India
 inhen aadhunik takneekee ke madhyam se jan-jan tak pahunchaana vikaas prashasan kaa mahatvapurn kaary he
 Cooperation of public relations: The purpose of administration is public interest, so for the implementation of development related programs, public cooperation and public relations is very important
 isse spasht hota he ki vikaas prashasan me jan sampark or jan sahyog kaa vishesh mahatva he
 In fact, through public relations, it can be known whether the benefits of public welfare programs are being reached or not and how the public reacts to them
 vikaas prashasan ke liye jan sahyog na keval aavashyak he balki iske abhaav main safalataa sambhav nahin he
 Development of economic, social and political structure: In fact, economic, social and political development related functions are the backbone of development administration
 is disha main kaary karnaa chunauteepurn hoti he
 The development of new types of economic and social structures by replacing the deficiencies and processes of traditional structures has become a very complex task in front of development administration
 in sanrachanaon kaa vikaas va sudhaar karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he

 The eighth-century Siddha Vinayaka black stone idol of Lord Ganesha, located in Baguwasa, Narkankal of Roopkund, proves the historicity of this journey, as well as the traditional Nanda Jagari of Garhwal also tells the story of this journey
 nandadevi se judy jaat do prakaar kii hai

 Then the journey returns to Nauti
 iske baad kasunwa, saim, koti, bhagauti, kulsari, chapadon, lohajang, vaann, bedani, paatar nachuniyan se vishwa-vikhyath rupkund, shila-samudr, homkund se chananyaanghat, sutol se ghat hote hue nandaprayag or phir nauti aakar yatra kaa chakra puraa hota he

 {according to beliefs, Rajajat occurs when symptoms of defecting to the goddess appear

 The meditators take out the yatra, which is called Dole Jatara
 kasuna ke kunwar nauti gaanv jaakar rajajat kii manauti karte hai
 Kunwar brings Ringal's Chhatoli and Chausingya Khadu
 chousinga khadu kaa janm lenaa rajajat kii ek khaas baat he
 The Nautiyals and Kunwar people carry the gift of Nanda on the back of Chausinga Khadu to the homkund
 vahaan se khadu akelaa hi aage bad jaataa he
 Bizarre miraculous events begin with the birth of Khadu
 jis gaushala main yah janm letaa he usee din se vahaan sher aana prarambh kar detaa he or jab tak khadu kaa maalik use rajajat ko arpit karne kii manauti nahin rakhata tab tak sher lagaataar aata hi rahata he

 According to the program announced on the occasion of Basant Panchami, this yatra will be completed on September 16 after lasting for 19 days
 is himalayan mahakumbh main samay ke saath dharmik paramparaayen to badalati rahi hai magar saamanti paramparaayen kab badalengi, yah sawaal munh baayen khadaa ho kar loktantrkaamiyon ko chidhaata ja rahaa he
 Like the inauguration of Badrinath, the Kunvars of Kasuwa village in Chamoli Garhwal and their Rajguru Nautiyals of Nauti village also announced the program of Nandadevi Rajajat on this Basant Panchami
 consuva gaanv ke thakur swayan ko sadiyon tak gadhwal par ecchhatra raaj karne vaale panvar vansh ke ek raja ajaypal ke chote bhai ke vanshaj maanate hai or isiliye ve raja ke taur par is himalayan dharmik padayatra kaa netritv karne ke saath hi use apana nijee kaarykram maanate hai

 The state government also seems to be standing firm with the feudal system instead of religious sentiments and pre-tradition
 rajajat ke liye uttrakhand sarkaar sahit aayojan samiti or anya sambandhit pakshon ne taiyaariyaan shuru kar di hai
 With this, the search for Chausingya Khadu to lead this historic journey has also started
 yatra se pehle is tarah kaa vicitra mendha chandpur or dasholi pattiyon ke gaavon main se kahin bhi janm letaa rahaa he
 About 200 local deities along with ringle-rings, bundles and markings made of special workmanship are included in this procession

 yatra ke dauraan puure solahaven padaav tak yah khadu yaa mendha nanda devi kii ringaal se bani chantoli ke paas hi rahata he
 Reaching a height of 3200 feet to 17500 feet above sea level, this 280 km long trek passes through 19 stops
 wan yatra kaa antim gaanv he
 There are also evidence of its 22 halts in ancient times
 wan se aage kii yatra durgam hoti hai or saath hi pratibandhit evam nishedhaatmak bhi ho jaati he
 According to the accounts of Bhuvan Nautiyal and his father Devaram Nautiyal, who are acting as the secretary of the Organizing Committee and the representative of the Nautiyal Brahmins, the leather goods such as shoes, belts, etc
, and gaje-gaja, women from Rinkidhar, a little ahead of Vana
 -children, eatables, etc

 abhakshya khaane vaali jatiyon kaa taatpary chipa nahin he
 There is no tradition of the participation of Scheduled Castes in this Yatra and the State Government's participation in this event directly recognizes not only the feudal system but also the evil of untouchability

, the Roopkund accident took place in 1150 in which Kannauj Naresh Jasdhaval or Yashodhaval and his wife Rani Ballabha, who had come to join Rajajat, died for the safety and recreation, etc
, with a number of hundreds
 jinke kankal aaj bhi rup kund main bikhare huye hai
 Records of the Rajajat held at Nauti in 1843, 1863, 1886, 1905, 1925, 1951, 1968 and 1987 are available
 isse spasht hota he ki prachlit manyatanusaar yah yatra har 12 saal main nahin nikalati rahi he

 After Nauti, the journey through Sem, Koti, Bhagoti, Kulsari, Chepdiun, Nandakeshari, Faldia village, Mundoli, Vana, Garolipital, Pataranchauni reaches its destination Homkund via Shilasamudra

 Yamuna Dutt Vaishnav has called it death street
 yahaan se neeche chalaang lagane waalon ke saath hi durghatana main maare gayi sekadon yatriyon ke kankal neeche rupkund main mili hai jinaki pushti diene se huyi he
 After this, the yatra descends towards the sea
 shila samudr kaa suryoday kaa drushya aalokik hota he
 From there, the flame of the three lamps, along with the sun's flame appearing on the Nandaghughti peak in front, gives a unique view
 rajajat ke maarg main himachhadit shikharon se ghiri rupkund jhil he jiske rahasyon ko sulajhane ke liye bharat hi nahi balki duniyaan ke kai deshon ke vaigyanik dashakon se adhyayan kar rahe hai
 Due to no restriction, these men have taken away the skeletons and other relics from the Roopkund lake, located at an altitude of 16200 feet above the sea level, by filling them in the scientific sacks of foreign countries
 phir bhi maanav bastiyon se bahut upar is jhil ke kinare ab bhi kai kankal pade hai
 Meat has also been found on some skeletons
 kankalon ke saath hi aabhushan, rajasthani juute, paan supaari, ke daag lage daant, shankh, shankh kii chudiyaan aadi saamagree bikhri padi he
 These hundreds of skeletons were first detected by a forest ranger in 1942
 is jhil ke kankalon par sabase pehle 1957 main amareeki vigyaani dow james graffin ne adhyayan kiya tha
 At that time, he had stated the age of these skeletons at about 650

 Among them, there are very few skeletons of local people

 Two skulls have also been found in these, which match the DNA of a particular Brahmin caste of Maharashtra and the skeleton of the head

 saamanti parampara ke samarthakon kaa daawa he ki consuva gaanv ke log gadhwal naresh ajay paal ke banshaj hai
 They believe that when the king shifted the capital from Chandpur Garhi, his younger brother living in Kansuva remained there
 isaliye us gaanv ke log apni jati kanvar likhte hai
 Any citizen of India has the freedom to write anything his caste
 koi swayan ko shahenshaah bhi likh saktaa he, lekin vah shahenshaah ho nahin jaataa he
 If the surveyors of this journey are writing themselves as Rajkumar, they also have the freedom to do this, but they do not have the freedom to treat people like a prince
 saamanytah ek hi mata se janmen rajkumaar is tarah rajpariwaar chhod kar gaanv main kheti karne yaa karaane ke liye nahin rukate
 No one knows the name of the Rajkunvar who stayed there

 pandit harikrishna ratudi dwaara likhe gayi gadhwal ke itihaas ke anusaar ajaypal ne san 1512 main chandpur gadhi se devalgarh main rajdhani sthantarit kii thi
 Many intellectuals of Uttarakhand still consider it irrational and feudal to think of themselves as Rajkumar by some of the bons of a king's brother about 500 years ago
 unka maananaa he ki ajaypal se lekar antim raja manvendra shah tak hajaaron rajkumaar paidaa huye honge or aaj unke vanshajon kii sankhya lakhon main ho gayi hogi

 In the 26th verse of the tenth chapter of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Lord Sri Krishna himself has acknowledged his importance and said - Devarshimancha Narada:
 devarshiyon main main naarad hum
 The Shrimad Bhagavata Mahapuranaka states that in creation, God took the third incarnation as Devarshi Narada and preached Sattvatantra in which the path of liberation from bhava-bandhan is shown by Satkarmo
 naarad ji muniyon ke devtaa the
 The description and designation of Devarshi is described in the Vayu Purana - The sages who have gained prestige in Devlok are known as Devarshi
 bhoot, vartmaan evam bhavishya-teenon kaalon ke gyaata, satyabhashi, swayan kaa saakshaatkaar karke swayan main sambaddh, kathor tapasya se lokavikhyath, garbhavastha main hi agyaan rupi andhkaar ke nasht ho jane se jinamein gyaan kaa prakaash ho chukaa he, aise mantravetta tathaa apane aishwarya ke bal se sab lokon main sarvatra pahunchne main sakasham, mantranaa hetu manishiyon se ghire hue devtaa, dwij or nripadevarshi kahe jate hai

 vartmaan samay main uplabdh naradpurana 22,000 shlokon vaala he
 The decrease of 3,000 verses is due to the destruction of some part of the ancient manuscript

 In this, all three aspects of astrology, theory, hora and samhita have been discussed

 This proves that Devarshinarad is also the principal teacher of astrology along with devotion
 aajkal dharmik chalchitron or dharawahikon main naarad ji kaa jaisaa charitra-chithran ho rahaa he, vah devarshi kii mahanata ke saamne ekadam bouna he
 The way Narada ji's character is being presented, due to this, his image in the common man has become that of a man or a clown who fights and fights
 yah unke prakand paanditya evam viraat vyaktitv ke prati saraasar anyaay he
 Narahari ji is guilty of contempt of these portions of Shrihari who flew
 bhagwaan kii adhikansh lilaon main naarad ji unke anany sahyogi bane hai
 He is the Councilor of God and is also the spokesman of the Gods
 naarad ji vastut: sahi myanon main devarshi hai
