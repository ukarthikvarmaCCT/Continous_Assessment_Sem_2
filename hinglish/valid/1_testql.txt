 So far, the entire part of the universe has been revealed, there are estimated to be about 19 billion sky Ganges and there are about 10 billion stars in each sky Ganges

 The primitive organism was born on our earth 2 billion years ago and man's incarnation on earth happened 10-20 million years ago

 For this reason, long distances between stars and other light years are measured
 ek prakashavarsh vah duuri he jo duuri prakaash ek lakh chhiyaasi hajaar mile prati second kii gati se ek varsh main tay karata he
 For example, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 125 million miles, light travels this distance in a quarter to eight minutes
 at: prithvi se surya kii duuri sava aath prakaash minute hui
 The distance from the stars through which light comes in eight thousand years, we have measured a quarter to twenty-four padma mi
 lekin taare to itani itani duuri par hai ki unase prakaash ke aane main lakhon, karodon, arabon varsh lag jaataa he
 In this situation we will not be able to express these distances in miles and neither will we understand anything

 In the field of cosmology, some important things have come up due to the discoveries of the last few years
 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth
 mount polomer vedhashala main sthit 200 inch vyasavaale lens kii doorabeen se khagol shastriyon ne akaash gangaaon ke dur hatane kii prakriya ko dekha he
 When we look at the universe with a telescope, we feel that we are the center of this universe and other things are running away from us
 yadi anya akaash gangaaon main prekshak bheje jaaen to ve bhi yahi paaenge ki is brahmad ke centre bindu hai, baaki akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary
 yah vah samay tha jab ki ainstin kaa saapekshavaad kaa siddhant apni shaishvavastha main tha
 However, Einstein's theory was more successful than Newton's theories in interpreting findings based on solar system observations

 After all, here Einstein misinformed Newton's letter
 logon ko ainstin kaa hi siddhant pasand aayaa
 Three concepts of the origin of the universe are presented xxrep 4 - 1

 Explosion Theory and 3

 The second assumption is more important in these assumptions
 is dharna ke anusaar brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he or isi kaaran akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi he
 If you put the inverted picture of this universe in front of you, then you will see the universe becoming disheveled, and the sky will appear as if the Ganges is not running
 at: kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kisi samay koi mahapind rahaa hoga or usee ke visphot hone ke kaaran akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Explosion theory is also confirmed by the discovery of new wires called quasars and pulsars

 Banks basically conduct credit - collect their surplus savings from the public on credit and lend that deposit to other borrowers in loan form
 is prakaar raashi ke lenden ke kram main bank saakh kaa srijan karte or saakh ke srujankarta kahe jate hai
 Deposit, deduction and release are the three functions involved in the creation of credit
 jab bank kisi vyakti yaa sanstha ko rin sweekrut karata he to vah saamanyat: rinrashi nakad rup main ek saath hi nahin detaa varan rinrashi ko rin maangnevaale kaa lekha kholkar usamen jamaa kar letaa he or rinyaachak ko adhikaar de diya jaataa he ki vah apane aavashyaktaanusaar check likhakar rinrashi nikaalata rahe
 In this way loan is sanctioned on one hand and on the other hand a deposit is made from the same loan amount
 at: rin jamaa ko janm dete hai

 at: rin dene se purv bank apane paas kosh main kuch nakad raashi bachaakar rakh letaa he jisase samay aane par usamen se jamakartaon kii maang puri karata rahe
 This amount is called the cash fund of the bank
 koi koi bank nakad kosh apane paas bhi rakhte hai or kendriya bank main bhi jamaa kara dete hai taaki aavashyaktaa padane par vahaan se raashi dekar jarmakartaon kii maang puri kar saken

 Out of this amount of interest, he saves the remaining amount with the depositors by giving them interest on their deposits
 bank ko apni sakal jamaa raashi main se kuch bhaag nakad kosh ke rup main rakhkar shesh raashi kaa saavdhaanee se viniyog karnaa aavashyak hota he
 The bank's investment policy varies in different countries, on different occasions and with different banks
 prayek bank ke liye apni viniyog niti nirdhaarit karte samay kai baton kaa vichaar karnaa aavashyak hota he
 The bank's amount should be appropriated in such a way that it can be converted into a cash amount if needed, the appropriated principal should be safe, the appropriations should also get a satisfactory income, the money should not be appropriated in any one industry trade, the bank's money is a particular person Not to be given as a loan, the security of the collateral should be thoroughly inspected, the security, on which the amount is being appropriated, should be liquid, safe and profitable
 And if the value of any security starts to fall in any bail, then the depreciation can be taken immediately by taking other bail from the debtor
 saamanyat: bank do prakaar se apni raashi kaa viniyog kiya karte hai: vyavsaay sanchaalan ke liye bhugruhadi, furniture aadi vastuen kharidkar
 The bank does not get any income from it

 He received his education from Acharya, a follower of Shankara Matha, Achutpreksh, and after making a discussion with the Guru, he formed his own separate opinion, which is called "dvaita darshan"
 inke anusaar vishnu hi paramatma hai
 Like Ramanuja, he supported Sri Vishnu's practice of amalgamating his limbs with signs of armaments, conch, chakra, mace and padma

 Mr
 Madhwacharya studied the 'panch Bhide', which is also called the 'extreme Bhed Darshanam'
 uski paanch visheshtayen hai : Classification of the 'utmost bhed darshanam' in substance form has also been done in this way: swatantra vah he jo purna roopen swatantra he
 Which is God or eternal truth
 lekin jeevatma or jagat bhagwaan par ashrith hai
 That's why God controls them
 paramatma swatantra hai
 Therefore their classification is impossible
 ashrith tatva sakaaratmak evam nakaaratmak rup main vibhajit kiye jate hai
 Positives can also be classified into conscious and unconscious
 achetan tatva ko paribhaashit karne ke pehle madhwacharya swatantra or ashrith ke bare main bataate hai jo sansar se nity mukt hai
 According to this ideology, 'vishnu' is independent who is the prudent and the controller of the world
 unki shakti lakshmi hai jo nity mukt hai
 We can find Vishnu in many forms of arithmetic and avatars
 usee prakaar atyant ashrith lakshmi bhi vishnu kii shakti hai or nity bhautik sharir liye hi kai rup dhaaran kar sakati hai
 He is beyond suffering
 unke putr brahma or vaayu hai
 The word 'prakriti' means p = beyond + Kriti = the confluence of the universe
 madhwacharya ne sristi or brahm ko alag mana he
 According to him Vishnu is the doer of the material world
 bhagwaan prakruti ko lakshmi dwaara shashakt banaate hai or use drishy jagat main parivartit karte hai
 Nature is the physical cause of physical objects, bodies and organs
 prakruti ke teen pahaluon se teen shaktiyaan aavirbhoot hai : lakshmi, bhu or durga
 Avidya is also a form of nature that hides the divine from the soul
 madhwacharya ji kaa vishwaas he ki prakruti se bani dharti maaya nahin, balki paramatma se pruthak satya he
 It is not the same change as the curd hidden in milk, nor the form of God
 isliye yah avishesh dwaitvaad hi he
 Madhvacharya accepted Ramanujacharya's classification of souls
 jaise :-- Madhvacharya added two more classes with him which is worthy of salvation and which is not worthy of salvation: is vargeekaran ke anusaar jeevatma kaa ek alag astitv he
 Thus one soul is different from another soul
 iskaa arthatma anek hai
 The Jeevatma is dependent on the divine instructions from God and being different from nature
 unke pichley janmon ke aadhaar par paramatma unhen prerit karte hai

 16veen shatabdi ke prarambh main samast pashchimi europe dharmik drushti se ek tha - sabhi isai the; sabhi roman katholic carch ke sadsy the; uski parampargat shiksha maanate the or dharmik maamalon main uske adhyaksh arthath rome ke pope kaa shashan sweekaar karte the
 European reforms or reforms refer to the great movement of the 16th century, which resulted in this unity of Western Christians being disintegrated and Protestant religion emerged
 carch ke itihas main samay-samay par sudhaarwadi andolan hote rahe kintu ve carch ke dharmik siddhaton athwa uske shaskaon ko chunauti na dekar unke nirdesh ke anusaar hi naitik buraaiyon kaa unmoolan tathaa dharmik shiksha kaa prachaar apana uddeshy maanate the
 The reform movement that began in the 16th century soon began to oppose both the traditional teaching of the Church and the authority of its rulers
 dharmasudhar andolan ke parinamswaroop europe main catholic sampradaay ke saath-saath luther sampradaay, calvin sampradaay, anglican sampradaay or presbyterian sampradaay prachlit ho gayi
 To understand this new form of reform, it is very important to consider the present situation in Europe
 isa dwaara pravartit katholic carch ke prati isaayiyon main jo shraddha kaa bhav shatabdiyon se chalaa aa rahaa tha vah kai kaarnon se kam ho gaya tha
 In the 14th century, a French pope was elected, who remained in France throughout his life
 iske falswaroop baad main 40 varsh tak do pope vidyaman the, ek france main or ek rome main, jisase samast katholic sansar do bhaagon main vibhakt rahaa
 In the eighth century, the Catholic king of the Franks defeated the Lavard army invading Italy and gave the central part of Italy under the authority of the Pope, and thus became an ordinary ruler in addition to the cleric of the Roman Catholic Church
 is kaaran germany or france ke raja sahaj hi carch ke maamalon main or visheshkar pope ke chunaav main hastkshep karne kaa prayaas karte rahe
 In the late 14th century, this election became a competition ground for Italian elites, focusing less on the individual's merit and more on his lineage
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki us samay nitant ayogy popon kaa chunaav hua or rome ke darbar main naitikta tathaa dharm kii upeksha hone lagi
 So it was quite natural for the Church of Rome to lose respect
 asantosh kaa ek or kaaran yah tha ki samast carch kii sansthaaon par unki sampatti ke anusaar kar lagaaya jaataa tha or rome ke pratinidhi sarvada ghumkar yah rupaya vasuul karte the
 Apart from this predicament of the central organization of the Church, the condition of various religions was not satisfactory
 is samay samast pashchimi europe lagbhag saat sau dharmapraanton main vibhakt tha
 Their rulers were called bishops
 ye bishap samant the jo raja dwaara praaia: abhijaat varg main se chune jate the, darbar ke sadsy the or germany main bahudhaa apane kshetra ke raajnneetik shaasha bhi the
 Therefore, many bishops were more interested in politics, less interested in religion and left the religious administration of their homeland to the highly empowered priests of the university
 gaanvon main basanevaale adhikansh saadhaaran purohit ardhashikshit the
 They were unable to give lectures and were often poor
 saadhaaran purohiton kii yah dayaneey dasha 16veen shatabdi ke europea katholic carch kii sab se badi kamajori thi
 There was no one to teach religious education to the general public except the visiting Franciscans etc
 isse sarvatra andhvishwaas fail gaya or karmkand ko anaavashyak evam asantulit mahatv diy jane laga
 In the 13th century, Catholic theology gave a rational representation of the doctrines through the Christian interpretation of Aristotle and the Scholastic Philosophy, but in the 15th century the focus and contemplation of the fundamental problems of religion were removed
 vishvavidhyalayon main dharmapandit gaun prashnon ke vishay main apane matbhedon ko adhik mahatv dene lage the jisase katholic dharmavigyaan itan nishpraan ho gaya tha ki kuch saadhakon kii yah dharna drudh ho gai thi ki dharmavigyaan sadhana main baadhak he
 Thus we see that there was a need for reform in all the areas of the church and the movement for reforms became imperative
 14veen shatabdi main angarej vicliff or baad main bohemia ke na hus jo sikhalaane lage the ki carch kaa sanghathan, uske sanskaar aadi yah sab manushyon kaa avishkaar he; isaayiyon ke liye bible hi paryaapt he
 Even at that time those ideas did not get much success, but their influence on Luther is obvious
 spain main tolido ke arbobishap cemeness ne carch ke anushaasan ke andar dharmasudhar andolan pravartit kiya jisase vahaan kaa vaataavaran purna rup main badal gaya kintu pashchimi europe main carch kii paristhiti main koi vishesh parivartan nahin ho paaya tha
 When Luther raised his voice against Rome, he had unprecedented success for another reason
 europe main us samay sarvatra pracheen unani tath latin sahitya kii lokapriyata ke saath saath ek naveen saanskrithik andolan prarambh hua jise rinesaan athwa navajagaran kaha gaya he
 As a result, a sense of personal freedom arose in the people
 mudran ke avishkaar ke kaaran isi samay se bible kii mudrit pratiyaan adhik saraltapurvak sulabh hone lagi thim, jisase logon ko apni ore se dharm ke vishay main sochane or bible ko apni nijee vyakhya karne kii pravriti ko bhi protsaahan milane laga tha
 The historical development of the European Reformation is as follows: It began with Luther's rebellion in 1517 AD
 unhone kin paristhitiyon main apana andolan pravartit kiya tha or carch ke kin paramparaagat siddhanto kaa virodh karke kis prakaar ek nayaa dharm chalaaya tha, iskaa varnan vishwakosh main anyatra kiya gaya he 
 At that time all of Germany was divided into about four hundred independent states
 unke adhikansh shaskaon ne katholic samrat charles ke virodh main luther ko sarankshan pradaan kiya or apni praja ko luther ke carch main mila diya
 Soon all the Scandinavian Christians also joined the Lutheran religion
 switsraland main dharmasudhar ke do netaa sarvapradhan the - jurik main jinvagli or janeeva main calovin, donon ke anuyaayi baad main ek hi kelvinist carch main sammilit ho gaye
 The sect also spread to Holland, Scotland and parts of France
 scotland main iskaa naam presbytareey dharm rakhaa gaya he france main pehle luther kaa prabhaav padaa kintu baad main vahaan ke adhikansh protestat dharmavalambee, jo yugani kehalaate hai, calovin ke anuyaayi ban gaye
 His organization was active for a long time as a political party
 england ke raja ne prarambh hi se luther kaa virodh kiya tha
 He also wrote a treatise in which he gave the pope's divine right to matters of religion
 yadhyapi henry jivan bhar apane rajya main protestant siddhanton kaa prachaar rokane kaa prayaas karte rahe, phir bhi unhone vyaktigat kaarnon se 1531 i
 main england kaa carch rome se alag kar diya, is prakaar anglican samudaay prarambh hua tha
 The Protestant ideology had a profound influence on the church during the time of Henry's successors, which is now considered one of the three major branches of Protestant religion, but the Anglican community in fact has its own distinct history of origin, development and propagation
 in teen sampradaayon ke atirikt dharmasudhar andolan ke falswaroop protestant dharm ke or bahut se upsampradaayon kaa udbhav hua jinka yahan par ullekh karnaa anaavashyak he
 Some details of the sects which are of relatively more importance are given elsewhere in the dictionary
 is simhavlokan se spasht ho jaataa he ki luther dwaara pravartit sudhaar andolan ne vibhinn rup dhaaran kar samast europe ko hilaa diya
 Initially the reform of the church was the aim of this movement, but it soon began to attack the traditional education of the church and the organizational unity of the church
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki europe ke isaisansar kii ekta shatabdiyon ke liye chhin-bhinn ho gai
 Completely independent sects emerged from the point of view of governance, which, while believing the same Jesus and the Bible, give different opinions about many fundamental religious principles
 raajnneetik drushti se dharmasudhar kaa parinaam bahut hi vyapak rahaa
 The later condition of Europe was such that the rulers too inevitably took an active part in this religious movement
 ve apni praja ko apane hi dharm main sammilit karne athwa banaae rakhane ke uddeshy se yuddh karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 Thus many wars in the name of religion are discussed in the history of Europe, such as the 30-year war in Germany, the Yugno War in France and the successful freedom struggle against Emperor Charles v in Holland
 upar iskaa ullekh ho chukaa he ki katholic carch main samay samay par sudhaar andolanon kaa pravarttan hota rahaa he kintu 16veen shatabdi ke vidrohatmak dharmasudhar se katholic carch ko vishesh rup se prerana mili
 This century saw the election of talented individuals as pope who have again given priority to spirituality under the rule of the Church, which again led to the reappearance of the pope in the entire Catholic world
 bishpon kii samantshahi ko samaapt kar diya gaya or chaaron or sadhuswabhaav vyaktiyon kii niyukti se janata ke saamne bishap kaa pracheen adarsh ubharne laga, jo apni praja kaa dharmaguru evam aadhyatmik charvaaha he
 The 19th World Assembly of the Church was organized in the city of Trent, in addition to the new organization of the Church, in particular the teaching of ordinary priests was arranged
 at: carch kii sabhi shreniyon main sudhaar hua or jansadharan main dharmik shiksha kaa uchit prachaar ho sakaa
 In this work, religious leaders have shared the hands of other priests
 16veen shatabdi main jesuit aadi kai dharmasanghon kii sthapana hui tathaa pracheen dharmasanghon main sudhaar laayaa gaya jisase ve sabake sab samay kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar dharm kii seva kar saken
 In this way, we see that perhaps the most profound and beneficial effect of the Reformation was on the old Catholic Church
 europea dharmasudhar kaa vyapak prasar evam gaharaa prabhaav dekhakar anayas hi man main yah prashn uthta he ki is apurv safalataa kaa kya rahasy he
 Several reasons for this success have been conceived: 15veen shatabdi ke aarambh main katholic carch kii dayaneey dasha or iske karnadhaaron kii niskriyata, carch kii sampati hadapney ko utsuk rajanetaaon kii sahaayta, navajagaran ke kaaran vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa andolan, mudran ke avishkaar se prachaar kii nai suvidhaayen
 All this proved to be helpful for the under-reported movement, but the secret of its success must be found elsewhere
 dharmasudhar ke pravartak satvik or dharmik bhav se prerit the or ve apane pratibhashali sahyogiyon main bhi dharmik navajagaran kii utkar abhilaashaa utpann karne main samarth hue
 In his view, the only remedy for that renaissance seemed to be that man would not surrender to Jesus by believing in his virtuous deeds, and believe in the Bible's gospel of Jesus safely
 unhone bible ko apane andolan kaa aadhaar bana liya, bible main jo shakti nihit he usee ke dwaara unhen safalataa mili he
 Nowadays 16th century events are being considered in the Christian world in neutral terms
 kathilak europea dharmasudhar kii rachanaatmak uplabdhiyon ko sweekaar karte hai or protetianst samajhane lage hai ki carch kii tatkaaleen buraaiyon kaa virodh karnaa kitna hi aavashyak kyon na tha, uski ekta chhin bhinn karne se isai dharm ko bahut haani hui he
 After the Second World War, the movement for Christian unity has been given utmost importance and the desire to remove the ill effects of the reforms is increasing
 martin luther ke purv dharmasudharkon ne chaudaavin sadi se hi carch or popashahi kii aniatikta, bhrashtataa, vilasita or shoshan ke viruddh apni aawaaj buland kii or unhone dharm sudhaar kii prishth bhoomi taiyaar kii
 These are the following

 Every Christian must act according to the principles of the Bible

 Modulation is the process of distinguishing one waveform from another waveform
 doorsanchaar main adhimishran kaa istemaal sandesh bhejne ke liye hota he, lekin ek sangeetkaar swar-saamanjasy ke liye kisi vaadyayantra ke swar kii maatra, uskaa samay yaa timming or swaraghaat ko alag karne main iskaa upyog karata he
 Often high frequency sinusoid waveforms are used as carrier signals for low-frequency signals
 sin wave ke teen pramukh maapdand hai - uskaa apana aayam, uske charan or uski aavriti, ek modulated singnal praapt karne ke liye in sabhi sanchaar sanket ko kam frequency ke aadhaar par sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 The device which performs modulation is called modulator and the device which performs the opposite action is called demodulator
 jo upkaran donon hi tarah kaa kaary kar saktaa he vah modem kehalaata he 
 The purpose of digital modulation is to transfer digital bit streams to an analog passband channel, for example; Public switched telephone networks, or transfers over a limited radio frequency band
 anuroop adhimishran kaa uddeshy ek anuroop besaband sanket ko hastantarit karnaa he, udhaaharan ke liye ek audio sanket yaa tivi sanket ko ek anuroop pasband channel par hastantarit karnaa he, doosraa udhaaharan radio frequency band yaa cabel tivi network channel ko simit karnaa bhi he
 Analog and numerical modulation simplifies frequency division multiplexing, while simultaneously transferring multiple low-pass information signals via separate passband channels via a shared physical medium
 ankiy besaband adhimishran pranali, jo ki line koding kehalaata he, kaa uddeshy bhi ek ankiy bit stream par besaband channel ko, ek serial bas yaa taar dwaara jude local aria network jaise non filter-tambe ke taar ke jariye hastanantarit karnaa he
 The purpose of a pulse modulation system is to transfer a narrowband analog signal, for example a call call coming to a wideband baseband channel, or in some schemes the beat stream to another digital transmission system
 anuroop adhimishran main, anuroop information sanket par adhimishran lagaataar chalata rahata he
 Common analog modulation techniques are as follows: ankiy adhimishran main, anuroop vaahak sanket ek ankiy bit pravaah ke jariye adhimishrit hota he
 The digital modulation method can have digital-to-analog conversion and demodulation or detection can be analog-to-digital conversion
 vaahak sanket main parivartan m vikalp pratikon ke ek parimit sankhya se chune jate hai
 a common example: a telephone line is designed to transfer audible sound, for example take a tone, it is not numeric bits
 computer isiilie telephone main modem ke jariye sampark sthapit kar saktaa he, jo ankiy bits kaa pratinidhitiv tone, jise pratik kehete hai, ke dwaara karata hai
 If there are four choice symbols, the first symbol can represent bit sequence 00, similarly the second one on 01, the third 10 and the fourth 11
 If a modem plays music with 1000 tones per second, its symbol rate is 1000 symbols
 / Per second, or baud
 Since each tone in this example represents a message with two numeric bits, the bit rate is twice the symbol rate i
e
 2000 bits per second
 ankiy sanket kii ek paribhaasha ke anusaar, adhimishrit sanket ek ankiy sanket he, lekin ek anya paribhaasha main adhimishran ko ankiy se anuroop ke roopantaran bhi kaha gaya he
 In most textbooks, the digital modulation scheme is synonymous with data transmission as digital transmission, in very few textbooks it is called analog transmission
 atyaadhik moulik ankiy adhimishran takanic is prakaar hai: In QAM, an infinite signal and a quadrature phase amplitude are expressed in a finite number
 ise ek tu-channel pranali ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, harek channel ASK kaa upyog karata he
 The resulting signal is equivalent to a combination of both PSK and ASK
 uparokt sabhi paddati main harek charan, aavruti yaa aayam ek adbhut dohare beats ke pattern dwaara tay hote hai
 Typically, each phase encodes the same number of beats of frequency or amplitude
 is bits kii sankhya main shaamil pratik kaa pratinidhitiv vishesh charan dwaara hota he
 If the alphabet includes m = 2 n { \ displaystyle m = 2 ^ {N}} as an optional symbol, each symbol represents a message of n bits
 yadi pratik dar f s { \ displaystyle f_{s}} pratik prati second he, data dar n f s { \ displaystyle nf_{s}} beats prati second he
 For example, an alphabet that has 16 optional symbols, each symbol represents 4 bits
 isliye data dar bod dar se chaar guna hoga
 In PSK, ASK or QAM, where the carrier frequency of the modulated signal is constant, the modulation alphabet often simply represents the zodiac, the i signal of the amplitude for each signal representing the x-axis and the q signal by the y-axis
 QAM ke siddhant kaa upyog kar PSK or ASK, lekin kabhi-kabhi FSK bhi aksar paidaa kiya or pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 The i and q signal can be combined into the complex-value signal i + jq
 natijatan samatuly lo-paas sanket yaa samatuly besband sanket ke naam se janaa jane vaala vaastavik maan adhimishrit sanket physical sanket jatil maan kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The following are the common steps useful for transmitting data by a modulator: resiver kii ore se aamtaur par di-modulator nimna kaary karata he: It is common in all digital communication systems that both the modulator and the de-modulator must be designed simultaneously
 Numerical modulation schemes are possible because both the sender-recipient parties must know in advance how to encrypt the data and how to represent the communication system
 In all digital communication systems, both the modifier of the sender and the de-modulator of the receiver are designed in such a way that they can work with each other in addition to their work
 asangat adhimishran paddati main ek praapak ko sandarbh kaald sanket jo ki preshak vaahak wave ke saath ek hi charan main ghatit hota he, kii jarurat nahin hoti
 aise maamle main adhimishran sanket main atulykaalik rup se sthanantarit hota hai
 The opposite is favorable modulation
 sabase zyada aam ankiy adhimishran takanic is prakaar hai: MSK and GMSK are special cases of continuous phase modulation
 darasal, CPM ke upakutumb kaa MSK vishesh maamla he, jo ki continus phej frequency-shift keeing ek sankethik-samay kii avadhi ke taur par bhi janaa jaataa he, jo ki ek ytaakar aavruti pulse he
 OFDM is based on frequency division multiplexing, but is used as a numerical modulation scheme
 bit stream kai samanaantar data strimon main vibhajit ho jaataa he or harek stream paaramparik ankiy adhimishran yojana kaa upyog kar apane sab-carrier main sthanantarit ho jaataa he
 The OFDM signal is an abbreviated form of a modulated subcarrier
 OFDM ek bahuvidhi takanic ke bajaay ek adhimishran takanic ke rup main mana jaataa he, kyonki yah kisi bit stream ko tathakthith OFDM ke ek anukram kaa upyag karke sanchaar channel main hastantarit kar detaa he
 OFDM can be expanded from channel access method to orthogonal frequency division multiple access and MC-CDMA scheme to multi-user channel, so that multiple users can use the same medium by giving code to different subcarriers or multiple users
 Allow to do
 do prakaar ke RF power vistaarak, swichan vistaarak kam keemat vaala he or ek hi output pavaar vaale liner vistaarak kii tulana main kam bydaree pavaar kaa upyog karata he
 However, they only work with relatively stable amplitude modulation signals such as angular modulation and CDMA, but not with QAM and OFDM
 Although the switching amplifier is also completely unsuitable for a common QAM group, the QAM modulation principle is often used to allow switching amplifiers to run with these fms and other waveforms, and sometimes QAM de-modulation uses these switching
 This is done to get the signal by the expanders
 ankiy besaband adhimishran shabd pankti kuta yaa sanket kaa paryaay he
 It is a method of transferring a digital beat stream to the analog baseband, using a pulse train, which is a discrete numbered signal level, directly through modulating the voltage and current in the cable
 ekadhruviya, non-ritern-tu-jiro, manchester or alternet mark invarsan kutalekhan vagairah iske saamaanya udhaaharan hai
 The purpose of pulse modulation scheme is to transfer a narrowband analog signal to the pulse wave via modulation as a two-level signal in the analog baseband
 kuch pulse adhimishran yojana nairoband anuroop sanket ko ek ankiy sanket ek sthai bit rate; jo ki anternihit ankiy preshak paddati he, ke rup main sthanantarit ho saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye kuch pankti kuta, ko sthanantaran kii anumati pradaan karata he
 In the formal sense, they do not fall under the modulation scheme, as they are not channel coding schemes, but should be treated as source encoding schemes and in some cases as analog-to-digital conversion techniques
 analog-over-analog paddatiyaan : Analog-over-digital methods: el en tii mahavidhyalay mujffarpur sthit bihar vishvavidhyalay kaa ek angeebhoot mahavidhyalay he

 'harry Potter character is described in this article
 isi naam ke upanyaas kram ke liye yahan jaayen : harry potter 
 Harry James Potter or Harry Potter J
 K
 a worldwide famous novel composed by Rolling is the main character of the sequence
 wo britain main rahane vaala ek kishor he jo ek aam insaan nahin, ek jaadugar he
 His parents were killed only when he was one year old
 hari potter kii sari kahaniyaan kaalpanik hai
 Harry is a simple and good boy who misses his parents a lot
 use kabhi maan-baap kaa pyaar nahin mila or hoguarts ke pehle to darsli use dabbu banaakar rakhte the
 Harr also has human flaws such as - he feels angry at many things, such as Voldemort and his crimes, abusing his parents, defying his own words, injustice on him, etc
 harry ek acha dost or acha quidich khilaadi he
 He is also good in studies
 voldemort or harry ek duusare ke jaani dushman hai
 By the way, Harry cares little about school rules
 wo bahut bahadur he, isiliye uskaa house garudadwar he
 Films have also been made on all the books of this novel series, in which Harry Potter is played by Daniel Radcliffe
 harry potter ek anaath ladkaa he
 He stays at his aunt Petunia Dursley's house, but he is not told that he is a magician
 11 saal kii umr main use rubius hagrid se is baat kaa pataa chalata he ki vah jaadugar he
 Later, he also learns that she is a snake speaker
 vah 11 saal kii umr main hogvarts jaakar tantra-mantra or jaadui kala sikhta he
 Where he encounters Voldemort
 harry-james potter ke mata-pita dono hi jaadugar the
 His mother's name was Lily Potter and father's name was James Potter
 dono hi jaadugar police ke sadsy the or unka khaas dushman tha ek dusht aatankwaadi jaadugar : lord voldemort
 When Harry was one year old, Voldemort murdered Lily and James with the Mritudyansham curse and read the same curse on Harry
 lekin harry ke marane ke bajaay voldemort ko usee kaa shaap palat kar lag gaya
 Harry only survived with a scar like lightning on his forehead
 voldemort khud apana jism khokar ek pretatma jaisaa banakar rah gaya
 Albus Dumbledore left Harry to his only relative: his aunt Petunia Dursley, Warts Vernon Dursley and Mouserra brother Dudley Dursley
 uske teenon rishtedaar aam insaan the or kisi bhi tarah ke jaadu yaa jaadu se judi chiz se sakht nafrat karte the
 They were people of very shallow mentality
 teenon ne hari ko saare bachapan bilkul jeena haraam kar diya tha, use pyaar dena to dur kii baat he
 Harry had no idea of the magic in his blood and the death of his parents
 lekin ek din sab badal gaya or wo jaadu kii duniya main waapas aa gaya
 Harry found many friends at Hogwarts, but the most notable of them were Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley
 ye teenon hameshaa saath rahete hai
 When the Harry Potter story began it was clear that the magic world had already taken place
 yah itani ullekhneey ghatana thi kii magalu bhi isse nahin batch paye, harry potter kii shrinkhalaa main kahani kii purna prishthbhumi kaa dhire-dhire pataa chalata he
 Like Harry was one of the first pupils when his parents were killed by Voldemort
 harry potter upanyaas main mukhya paatr he
 Which is written in seven episodes
 upanyaas kii pehali kadi harry potter or paras pathar main jab hari 11 saal kaa tha, tab use tantra-mantra or jaadu-tone ke vidhyalay hoguarts kaa rakhwala bataata he ki wo ek jaadugar he or use use hoguarts ke pradhamacharya dambldor ne vahiin padhane kaa nyotaa diya he
 In this way, Harry is first acquainted with the magical world and enrolls in Hogwarts
 kaafii romaanchak zindagi ke baad usne amarta dene vaale paras pathar ko profesar quiral ke sir main ghuse voldemort ke haathon se bachaaya
 
 upanyaas kii duusari kadi harry potter or rahasyamayi tahkhaanaa main harry ko hoguarts main lard voldemort kii puraani diary milti he
 Through this, his apparition wanted to return
 ron kii bahan jinni visli ko fusalaakar lard voldemort ne rahasyamayi tahkhaanaa khulavaa diya, jisase ki wo ashuddh koon vaale jaadugar chaatro ko ek vishaal naag dwaara marava daale
 Harry also ruined his plan
 upanyaas kii teesri kadi harry potter or azkaaban kaa qaidi kii kahani main jaaduugaron kii jail azkaaban se ek qaidi sirius blike bhaag nikalataa he apana badla lene ke liye
 Sirius used to be a friend of James Potter
 pehle hari ne sochaa kii sirius badmaash he or useene uske maan-baap ko dhokhaa dekar unki hatya karaayi thi
 But it is later revealed that Sirius was innocent and was murdered by Peter Petigrew, another friend of James
 hari or harmaini kii madad se sirius kanoon kii pahunch se baahar bhaag jaataa he
 In the fourth episode of the novel Harry Potter and the Cup of Fire, Harry has to take part in a triangular series of forced witchcraft at Hogwarts
 pehle charan main harry dragon se ladata he, duusare charan main jhil ke pani ke neeche sangharsh karata he or tisare charan main use bhul-bhulaiya main se trophy leni hoti he
 On the contrary, he and his co-competitors reach Lord Voldemort upon touching the trophy, where Wormtail kills Cedric and with the help of Harry's blood, he resurrects Lord Voldemort, including jimmo-jan
 magar hari voldemort kii pakad se is baar bhi bhaag nikalataa he
 Britain's vassal Cornelius Fudge describes Voldemort's return to life as a lie
 upanyas kii paanchavi kadi harry potter or mayapamchi kaa samooh main sabase pehle hari ko jaadu kii adaalat main haaziri deni padati he
 He is wrongly sued for a minor offense in which he was innocent
 par muqadame main use begunaah sabit kar diya jaataa he
 After this, the unruly interference of Jadumantri Cornelius Fudge starts back at Hogwarts
 kaali kalaon se aatmaraksha vishay ke liye mintralay se jaadoomantri kii sachiv doloris ambridge aati hai jo saare aam hari ko jhootha qaraar dene par tuli rahati hai
 Later, Cambridge also becomes the principal of the school
 ant ke dinon main sirius ko bachaane ke liye hanri or uske kai dost jaadoomantralay ke rahasy vibhaag pahonchte hai jahaan voldemort bhi aa jaataa he
 Harry survives this time due to Dumbledore, but Sirius is killed
 upanyaas kii chhathi kadi harry potter or haaf-blad prince main hari ko dambldor kii yaadon ke dwaara voldemort kii pehle kii zindagi ke bare main kaafii kuch pataa chalata he
 On the other hand, Harry gets a lot of help from a strange and anonymous book in the magical decorating class, which the owner used to call himself a half-blood prince
 usee saal ek nayaa jaadoomantri banataa he : rufas screemager
 Harry and Dumbledore act as if Voldemort had torn his soul into seven pieces to immortalize himself and put everyone in a Horcrux
 hari or dambldor ek horcrax ko nasht karne ek gupha main jate hai lekin unke niraashaa hi haath lagati he, kyonki horcrax nakli niklaa
 After this, Professor Snape, Harry's least favorite teacher, kills Dumbledore with the Death Curse
 harry potter or maut ke tohafe kadi is kram kaa aakhri upanyaas he
 In this novel, Harry Potter encounters a satanic emperor
 is upanyaas main harry ko horcrax naamak vastu ko khojataa he
 In this object, the evil demon hides his soul by dividing seven parts and hiding the jagah separately
 harry potter or uske saathi horcrax kii khoj main jate hai or unhe voldemort kaa saamana bhi karnaa padataa he kahani ke ant vah voldemort ko haraane main kaamyaab ho jate he

 chak de! india 2007 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 After a long time, Yash Chopra's film is out of love and love and audiences have liked it
 hockey kii prashthabhumi me bani chak de india me shahrukh khan ne apni romantic chhavi se hatakar ek aise haaki coach kii bhoomika nibhaai he jiskaa ekmaatr lakshya apni team ko vishwa cap jitaana he
 The film shows us all the aspects of Indian hockey due to which she is now going to the abyss
 team me anushaasan kii kami, senior khilaadiyon kaa junior khilaadiyon ke prati auchha vyavhaar, achche khel maidan kii kami, prashasko kaa khilaadiyon kii prati udaseenta or khilaadiyon me desh or team ke liye khilne kii kam hoti jaati bhaavana kii vajah se haaki ko hote hue nuksaan ko dikhaaya gaya he
 Bollywood has a good number of films made over sports and Chak De India is the name after Lagaan
 yah film sirf ek khel kii hi kahani nahi he, yah ek coach or uski team kii ummiido, jajbato, himmat, saahas or sapano kii kahani he
 Sports-based films in India are made up of counting
 khushi kii baat he ki pichley ek-do varshon se filmon main bhi khel dikhaai dene laga he
 Hockey is our national sport and at the moment it is considered a backward sport
 is khel par film banaakar nirdeshak shimit amin ne ek saahasik kaam kiya he
 Go win! India is a Hindi film made by Yash Raj Films
 film kabir khan naamak ek hockey khilaadi par kendrit he
 The media accuses Kabir of fixing when India lost a hockey match to Pakistan under Kabir's captaincy and Kabir was expelled from the hockey team
 iske kuch saal baad kabir bhartiya stri hockey team ke coach banate hai or unhen hockey vishwa cap jeetne main sahaayta karte hai
 'chak De India' is the story of Kabir Khan, who was once the best center forward of the Indian team
 pakistan ke viruddh ek final match main vah antim kshanon main penlti stroke ke jariye gol banane main chook gaya or bharat match haar gaya
 Being a Muslim, his patriotism was questioned
 use gaddaar kaha gaya
 His career as a player came to an end after that match
 saat varsh baad vah mahila hockey team kaa prashikshak banataa he
 By making this team a world champion, he wants to wash away the stains on him, but his path was not easy
 hockey khilaadi kii sthiti "bharat ke liye khele ek shreshth hockey khilaadi kii aarthik sthiti kya hoti he, ye nirdeshak ne shahrukh ko ek khatara scooter par baitaakar bina samvaad ke jariye bayaan kar di
 "the focus of these girls was less on sports
 ve keval naam ke liye khelti thim
 There was no unity among these girls who came from different regions
 senior khiladiyon kii dadaageeri thi
 Kabir puts the mind of these players that they are Indians first, then they are from Maharashtra or Punjab
 phir shuru hota he prashikshan kaa daur
 Obstacles come from all sides and Kabir crosses these hurdles and eventually makes his team the winner
 kahani badi saral he, lekin jayadeep saahani kii patakatha itani umdaa he ki pehali frem se hi darshak film se jud jaataa he
 The small scenes are so well written and filmed that many scenes touch the heart directly
 shahrukh jab apni team kaa parichay praapt karte hai to jo ladki apane naam ke saath apane pradesh kaa naam jodatii he, use ve baahar kar dete hai or apane naam ke saath bharat kaa naam jodne vaali ladki ko ve shaabaashi dete hai
 It is a severe blow to those who are first in their state and Indian later when choosing talent in talent search program
 australia main stadium ke baahar khadey shahrukh ek videshi karmchaaree ko bharat kaa tirangaa lagaate hue dekhte rahete hai
 When a player comes to them and asks, Sir, what are you doing here, then Shah Rukh's answer is that i am seeing a white person flying the tricolor for the first time
 bharat ke liye khele ek shreshth hockey khilaadi kii aarthik sthiti kya hoti he, ye nirdeshak ne shahrukh ko ek khatara scooter par baitaakar bina samvaad ke jariye bayaan kar di
 Being a women's team, they also have to fall prey to the splattering of men
 hockey association ke padaadhikariyon kii soch rahati he ki chakala-belan chalaane vaali ladkiyaan hockey kya khelengi, lekin nirdeshak ne kai drishyon ke jariye sabit kiya he ki mahilaayein kisi bhi maamle main purushon se kam nahin hai
 Shah Rukh talks in one place, 'A woman who can produce a man can do anything'
 film kaa sangeet saleem-suleman dwaara diya gaya he or bol jayadeep saahani ne die hai
 Upon release, the film recorded below average opening in India
 jiske kaaran ise bharat ke kai hisso me kam screene mili jaise ki pashchim bengal
 However, the film received more than 80 percent occupancy due to strong critical response to the film
 iske baad, chak de ! ko bihar rajya mai kar se chhot pradaan kiya gaya tha 
 Within a week, the film's box office collection reached 220 rupees
 is film ke cinema ghar ke baahar nikalne tak yah film 1ki teesri sabase adhik kamai karne vaali film ban chuki thi
 Domestically with a revenue of 1 rupee
 It proved to be a blockbuster at Box Office India
 shimit kaa nirdesan behad shandaar he
 He has filmed a tight screenplay
 ve hockey ke jariye darshakon main rashtraprem kii bhavanaayen jagaane main kaamyaab rahe
 In a scene, when the tune of 'jana-gana-mana' is played before the match, the audience present in the theater stands in respect
 film main har match ke dauraan cinemaghar main upasthit darshak bhartiya team kaa is tarah utsaah badhaate hai, jaise stadium main baithkar ve sachmuch kaa match dekh rahe hon
 Every audience finds themselves connected to the team and this is where Shimit's success is seen
 film ek tej gati se badhati jaati he or kisi bhi samay bojhil yaa rukii hui nahi lagati
 The script of the film keeps the audience hooked and the music of the film has also been liked by the people, which is not only favorable on the scenes of the film but also motivates people
 film darshako ko apane saath shuru se jod leti he or vishwa cap ke maichon me darshak bhi team kaa haunsala badhaate hue nazar aate he
 Shah Rukh Khan has played the role of a tarnished player and a tough trainer
 ve shahrukh khan nahin lagakar kabir khan lage hai
 In many scenes, he has expressed his feelings with mere eyes
 kalank dhone kii unki bechaini unke chehre par dikhaai detii he
 The 16 girls in his team were also no less in terms of competing with Shahrukh
 unki aapasi nokajhonk or hockey khilne vaale drishy umdaa hai
 The girls from Punjab and Haryana have great performances
 film main gane hai, lekin ve parshv main bajte rahete hai
 These songs have been used at just the right places
 jayadeep saahani ke samvaad saraahneey he
 Overall, 'chak de India' must be seen once

 Their role is so important that they either initiate the chemical reactions of the body or increase their speed
 inkaa utpreran kaa gun ek chakree prakriya he
 Like all catalysts, fermentation also acts to reduce the catalytic energy of the reaction, resulting in an increase in the reaction speed
 adhikansh prakinwan abhikriyaayein anya gaiyr-utprerit abhikriyaaon kii tulana main lakhon guna tej gati se hoti hai
 Similarly, like all other catalytic reactions, fermentation does not consume in the reaction, nor does the reaction change the equilibrium
 phir bhi prakinv anya adhikan utprerakon se is baat main alag hote hai, ki prakinv kisi vishesh abhikriya ke liye vishisht hote hai

 There are generally three types of reactions with substrates
 sabstrate kaa anukulan tab hota he, jab prakinv sabstrate anuon ke saath kriya kar unke saath rasinic sambandh banaate hai
 In this, the fermentation reacts with the substrate and breaks down its molecules
 sabstrate ke saath kriya kar enzim usamen rasinic parivartan karata he or anuon ke electron kii sthiti main parivartan kar detaa he
 Due to this, the molecules are able to form relationships with the remaining molecules
 prakinv jab sabstrate ke sampark main aate hai to un par gadde ban jate hai
 Substrates react chemically with these pits and come into chemical form when exposed to fermentation
 is kriya ke puure hone par ve us utpaada ko mukt kar dete hai or duusare sabstrate ke saath kriya ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 In this way, the fermentation is never destroyed, but they are frequently involved in the cyclic process

 islamic dharamshastra main imaan islamic dharamshastra ke aadhyatmik pahaluon main ek aastik vishwaas ko darshata he
 The simplest definition of this is the belief in the six articles of faith, known as "araqan al-iman"
 iskaa arth islam ke chah vishwaas ke vishyon main aasthaa rakhana he
 The word Iman is depicted in both the Quran and hadith-e-jibril
 quran ke mutabik, imaan ko dharmik karmon ke saath hona chahie or swarg main pravesh ke liye donon ek saath jaruri hai
 In Jibril's Hadith, the dimensions of Islamic religion form the three "islam", "ihsan" and "iman"
 islam ke bheetar or baahar, dharm main vishwaas or hetu kii charchaa hoti he, or donon ke saapeksh mahatv ko bhulaayaa nahin jaasakata
 Many scholars argue that both originate from a single source and place for trust and reason, so both should be harmonious
 arabi main, imaan, uccharan kaa arth he " vishwaas "
 This verb is a noun, آمن, meaning to believe in something
 haddees main mohammad sahib ne "imaan kaa matlab - dil main gyaan, jeebh par awaz, or haath pair main gatividhi" ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 Faith is a belief in the truth that is real
 jab logon ko vishwaas hota he, to ve khud ko us satya se jod dete hai
 Knowing the truth is not enough, the heart must accept it, it must be expressed by the tongue, which is an expression of wisdom and in the end it is necessary to execute it to reflect their confidence
 hamiduddin faraahi, apane tafseer main imaan ke arth kii vyakhya karte hue, likhaa he: Faith is generally outlined using six articles of faith: inamen se pehle quran or mohammad dwaara pehle paanch kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, jabaki allaah main vishwaas kii ek siddhant shaamil he - bhagwaan dwaara aadeshit bhagya ke achche or bure - ne sabhi chah ko nimnlikhit tareeke se sanderbhit kiya he gabrial ke haddees main: There is another similar description from Muhammad as well: " ebn abbaas ne varnan kiya ki malak jibril ne ek baar paigambar se poocha: "mujhe bataao imaan kya he?" paigambar ne uttar diya: "imaan he vishvas karnaa allaah par, nyaay ke din par, uske malaika par, kitaaben or paigambaron, or mrityu ke baad jivan main vishwaas karnaa he, or swarg or narak main vishwaas karnaa or mizaan kii sthapana par jo hamaare karm ko tolane ke liye he, or taqadir main vishwaas karnaa, iske achche or bure par
 Jibril then asked him: "if i do all this, will i stay with Iman?" The Prophet said: "when you have done all this, you will be in Imaan
 " It is also believed that the essential imaan consists of the first 3 things
 quran main, 10 gunon main se ek gun imaan he jo kisi ko allaah kii dayaa or inaam praptakarta banane ke kaaran miltaa he
 The Quran states that faith can increase with remembrance of Allah
 quran yah bhi kahata he ki is duniya main momin ke liye ati priy chiz vishwaas ke ilaava kuch bhi nahin hona chahie
 Muhammad has said that; He attained the sweetness of faith which led Allah to accept Islam as religion and Muhammad as Prophet
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki jab tak vah apane bacchon, mata-pita or rishtedaaron se zyada paigambar se pyaar nahin karata tab tak koi bhi sachcha aastik nahin ho saktaa
 In another example, he remarks that it is only after falling in love with Allah and Muhammad that a person can become aware of the true taste of faith
 quran ke ek mufassiron amin ahsaan islahi ne is prem kii prakruti arth ko spasht kiya he: 

prem does not merely imply inherently passionate love for one's wife, children and other relatives, but it also refers to love based on certain attitudes and wisdom and principles
 is prem ke kaaran hi ek vyakti, jivan ke har kshetra main, is drushtikon or siddhant ko praathamikta detaa he
 If a man grapples with the demands of his wife, children, and relatives with this approach, he follows it without hesitation, due to this sincere love for the wishes of his wife and children and the demands of his family and clan
 Does
 islahi or maududi donon ne anumaan lagaaya he ki adhyay 14 main ek achche shabd or bure shabd kii quran kii tulana vastav main vishwaas or avishvaas kii tulana he
 Thus, the Quran is effectively comparing faith to a tree whose roots lie deep in the soil and branches spread across the vastness of the sky
 imaan mohammad dwaara allaah se kii gai ek prarthana kaa vishay bhi he: Oh allah! i have rejected myself and handed myself over to you, and i have recognized your magnification and first come to your shelter, running away from you is not going to get anywhere
 agar kahin hai to aapke saath he
 Lord! i have believed in your book which you have revealed and believe in the Prophet whom you have sent as Prophet
 imam al-behaqi apni kitaab shub al-imaan main sankalit kiya he ki vishwaas kii 77 shakhaaen he
 In it, he has explained the essential qualities of faith, mentioning the Quranic imports and the hadiths of the prophet, which reflect the faith
 nimnlikhit haddees mohammad sahib par aadhaarit he: Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said: “iman has more than 70 branches
 in shakhaon main sabase utkrisht" laa elaha illallaah " padhanaa he, or sabase choti shakha raste main padhi baadha ko dur karnaa he
 And Haya is an important branch of Imaan
 " In Islam, it is necessary that harmony and coordination exist between faith and deeds
 faraahi ne is pahalu ko apane tafaseer main nimnlikhit tareeke se samajhaayaa he: Religious deeds are mentioned in the Quran after faith


 In the case of faith, the need for its interpretation is clear: the place of faith is heart and intelligence
 buddhi or dil ke maamalon main, na keval ek vyakti dusron ko dhokhaa de saktaa he balki kabhi-kabhi vah khud dhokhe main rah saktaa he
 He considers himself a Moomin when in fact he is not
 is kaaran se, iske liye do sakshya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he: ek vyakti ke shabd or vyakti ke karm
 Since words can be untrue, a person who claims faith only through words is not considered as a Mu'man and it was considered necessary that a person's deeds also bear witness to his faith
 is prakaar quran ne kaha : he aap jeebh se vishwaas karte hai! apane karmon ke madhyam se vishwaas karo
 The relationship between logic and belief in Islam is a complex debate spanning centuries
 ismail raji al-faaruqi is vishay par bataate hai: non-muslims may oppose the principles of Islam
 haalanki, unhen pataa hona chahie ki islam apane siddhanton ko vishesh rup se vishpasht rup se nahin pesh karata he, jo vishwaas karte hai yaa vishwaas karnaa chaahate hai vah kar sakate hai
 Islam offers this logically, rationally
 yah hamaare paas taarkik or susangat tarkon ke saath aavashyak aadhaaron ke saath pesh karata he
 It is not lawful for us to disagree on the basis of personal taste, or subjective experience

 bhubaneshwar prasad shrivastav hindi sahityakar the
 Bhubaneswar was born in a middle-class family in Shahjahanpur
 bachapan main hi unki maan kaa dehant ho gaya
 Due to this, he had to face extreme neglect at home
 kam umr main ghar chhodkar jab ilahabaad aaye to shahjahanpur main mahaj intermediat tak padhe is lekhak ke angreji gyaan or bauddhikta kaa vahaan ke lekhakon par aatank chaa gaya
 In those times of idealism and realism, his works revealed the frontiers of both in such a way that various legends about them started spreading
 hindi ke prasiddh ekankikar, lekhak evam kavi the
 Bhubaneswar is the name of the literary world, which in its short life span created a different kind of literature
 bhubaneshwar ne madhya varg kii vidambnaaon ko katu satya ke pratirup main ukera
 He also has the distinction of being the father of modern units
 ekanki, kahani, kavita, samiksha jaisi kai vidhaon main bhubaneshwar ne sahitya ko nae tevar vaali rachanaaen deen
 a litterateur who developed a new pattern of modern sensations from his works
 premchand jaise sahityakar ne unako bhavishya kaa rachanaakaar mana tha
 One of the main reasons for this was that Bhubaneswar was the creator of thinking far ahead of his creation
 unki rachnaayon main kalathitata kaa bodh he, parantu ascharyajanak rup se yah bhootkaal se na jud kar bhavishya ke saath zyada praasangik nazar aati hai
 In the role of 'caravan', Bhuvneshwar himself has written that 'vivek and logic are the thieves of the third class artists'
 unka yah maananaa unki rachanaaon main spashtatya drashtigochar bhi hota bhi he
 The picture that he carved of transforming a human being into an object becomes even more relevant in today's time
 bhubaneshwar kii sahitya sadhana bahuaiami thi
 His writings in the story, poetry, poetry and reviews all convey a new feeling
 choti si ghatana ko bhi nai, parantu vaastaviktaa ke sarvaadhik sannikat drashti se dekhne kaa najariya bhubaneshwar kii visheshta he
 In 1933, Bhubaneswar's first encounter 'shyama: Ek matrimonial irony' was published in 'hans'
 1935 main prakashit ekanki sangrah ‘kaaravaan’ ne unhen ekankikar ke rup main pratishthit kar diya
 The play 'copper worm' written by Bhubaneswar has the honor of the first inconsistent drama written in any language of the world
 unke dwaara likhit ekankiyon main ‘shyamphek vaivaahik vidmvana’, ‘romanceromaanch’, ‘strike’, ‘oosar’, ‘sikandar’ aadi kaa naam ullekhneey he
 Premchand, the first story of Bhubaneswar, was ranked by Premchand in a representative compilation of contemporary stories, 'adarsh stories of Hindi'
 unki kahani ‘bhediye’ hans ke april 1938 ank main prakashit hui
 This story created a strong foundation in the tradition of modern stories
 kaise registan se gujarata banjaaraa bhediyon se jaan bachaane ke liye unke aage chugga phenkata he
 In this sequence of throwing, both in the story and in life, the first things are thrown which are of relatively less importance
 is kahani ne jivan kii kadvi sachai ko bina laag-lapet ke prastut kiya
 Some writers consider the heart of this story to be the best among the selected conclusions of a management class
 ‘mausi’, ‘ladaai’, ‘maan bete’, ‘mastani’ aadi anya ullekhneey kahaniyaan hai
 Apart from this, Bhubaneswar has also written some poems and critical articles in English and Hindi
 parantu unke krititv ko pahchaanane main logon ne bhul kar di
 Perhaps this was the reason that this unique creator had to spend his life in conflicts and controversies
 premchand ne unase hans se sthai rup se judane kaa aagrah kiya tha
 But this dialogue could not be completed due to unknown reasons
 haalanki unki rachanaayen hans main lagaataar prakashit hoti raheen
 But if he had been associated with Hans, his creation would have been far wider than the world before us
 unke antim samay kii rachanaaon ko sahejnaa vaala unke saath koi nahin tha, jiske falswaroop us dauraan raf kaagajon ke peeche likhaa gaya hindi or angreji kaa purnataya moulik sahitya andheron main gum ho gaya
 All the available works of Bhubaneshwar need to reach the people again today
 lekhak kii rachanaaon ke anushilan se yahi dharna banati he ki pashchim ke aadhunik sahitya kaa unhone acha adhyayan kiya he
 Ibsen, DH seems to be particularly attached to Lawrence and Freud
 zindagi ko unhone kadavaahat, tikhepan, vikruti or vidrupatha se hi dekha tha
 Probably this is the reason why intense sentiments, strong resentment and fierce rebellion have appeared in them
 jivan kii is katu anubhuti ne hi unhen fakkad, nirdvandv or sanyamheen bana diya tha
 Bhubaneshwar created the tradition of Hindi western style unicorn
 unki pratham rachana 'shyama--ek vaivaahik vidambnaa', 'hans' ke disambar, 1933 i
 ke ank main prakashit hui
 After this, other unicorn compositions 'satan', 'A neutral communist', 'marriage of genius', 'mystery thrill', 'lottery' were published
 inhen sangrahit karke unhone san 1956 i
 main 'kaaravaan' sangya dekar prakashit kiya
 All these units bear the mark of the Ekanki style of the West
 vishay-vastu or samasya ke vishleshan main pashchim ke buddhivaadee naatakakaron ibson or sha kaa prabhaav he
 The appendices given by the appendices remind Sha's satire and Freud's sexually-oriented ideology
 bhubaneshwar ke or bhi ekanki prakashit hote rahe- 'mrityu', 'ham akele nahin hai' tathaa 'sava aath baje', 'strike' or 'oosar' in rachanaaon main unki drushti kaa visstaar dekhne ko miltaa he
 By rising above the triangle of sexual problems and love, he also began to see the pain and suffering of the society
 san 1938 i
 main sumitranandan pant dwaara sampadit 'roopabh' patrika main unhone ek bade naatak 'aadamkhor' kaa pehla ank prakashit karaayaa
 From this he has taken a very realistic view of the inauguration of the harsh realities of life
 san 1940 i
 main unhone gogol ke prasiddh naatak 'inspector general' ko lagbhag poun ghante ke ekanki kaa rup diya
 In 1941 AD, in Vishwavani, an experiment titled 'roshni and Aag' appeared, in which the Greek plays resembled Poorvalap
 'kathputliyaan' main unhone pratikwaadi style apanaayi
 The drama of Bhuvaneshwar was seen in mature form in contrast to these experimental works
 'photographer ke saamne' ,'tambe ke keede' main manushya kii badhati hui arthlolupata kaa udghaatan he
 In the year 1948 AD, 'history of Duality' was written alone and in addition to this many historical figures were published - 'foundation of Independence', 'jerusalem', 'alexander,' Akbar 'and Genghis Khan
 in rachanaaon main rashtriyata kaa swar bhi ubhaara he
 The final masterpiece is 'co's car'

 film nirmaan ek praarambhik story idia yaa kamishan se, patakatha lekhan, shooting, sampadan, nirdesan evam darshakon tak uske vitaran ke madhyam se film nirmaan kii ek prakriya he
 Usually, a large number of people are involved in it and it takes a few months to a few years to complete
 film nirmaan kaa kaary duniya bhar main aarthik, saamaajik or raajnneetik sandarbhon kii ek vishaal shrenee main sabhi jagah ghatit hota he or isamen praudyogiki or takanic kii vibhinn kismon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Filmmaking takes place in five stages: is charan main, is pariyojna kaa nirmaataa ek kahani khojataa he jo kisi kitaab, naatak, anya film, satya-katha, moulik idia se mil sakati he
 After identifying the original subject or underlining its messages, the producer works with the author to summarize the story
 iske baad ve ek step outline taiyaar karte hai, jo puri kahani ko ek-anuchhed ke drishyon main vibhajit kar detaa he jiskaa puraa dhyaan naatakeey sanrachana par hota he
 Then, they prepare a 25–30 page treatise on the story and its mood and characters
 isamen aamtaur par chota samvaad or manch nirdesan hota he, lekin isamen praaia: chitra bhi shaamil rahete hai jo mul vinduon ko disha dene main madad karte hai
 Another way to present a scripment is to prepare syrup
 iske baad, patakatha lekhak kai maheenon se adhik kaa samay lekar patakatha likhata he
 The screenwriter may rewrite it several times to improve the dramatic adaptation, clarity, structure, characters, dialogue and overall style
 haalanki, nirmaataa aksar pichley charnon ko chhod dete hai or prastut patakatha kaa vikaas karte hai jise niveshak, studio or anya icchhuk partiyaan ek prakriya dwaara aankati hai jise patakatha kawarej kaha jaataa he
 The film distributor may be approached at an early stage to review the potential market and the potential financial success of the film
 hollywood vitarak kathor vyapaarik drushtikon ko apanaate hai or film vidha, lakshya shrota, samaan filmon kii aitihaasik safalataa, abhinayta jo film main aa sakate hai or sambhavit nirdeshkon jaise tatwon par vichaar karte hai
 All these elements inform the potential audience and thus a definite appeal to the number of "ais" during theatrical performances
 sabhi filmein keval cinemagharon main relies se laabh nahin kamaatin, isliye film companiyaan dividi bikri or duniya bhar main uske vitaran kaa adhikaar le leti hai
 Producers and screenwriters prepare a film pitch or treatment and present it to potential investors
 yadi pich safal hota he to film "green lite" praapt karti he, matlab kuch log vittiya sahaayta pradaan karte hai jiskaa arth he: aamtaur par ek bada film studio, film concil yaa swatantra niveshak
 judi hui partiyaan baatcheet karti hai or ek samjhaute par hastakshar karti hai
 Once all the parties have met and the deal is finalized, the film can move towards the pre-construction period
 is str tak, film ke paas ek spasht rup se paribhaashit vipanan ranneeti or lakshya darshak hone chahie
 In pre-production, every step of making a film is actually carefully planned and designed
 nirmaan company banaai jaati he or nirmaan karyaalay kii sthapana kii jaati he
 The production is planned and visualized with the help of painters and concept artists
 film ke liye yojana vyay hetu ek production bajet taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Major productions are insured against accident protection
 nirmaataa ek dal ko kaam par rakhata he
 During film production, the size and type of crew working according to the nature and budget of the film is determined
 kai hollywood kii pramukh filmon main saikadon kalakaar or chaalak dal niyukt kiye jate hai, jabaki ek kam bajet vaali or swatantra film ko aath yaa nau kii nunatam sankhya ke karmiyon ko lekar banaaya ja saktaa he
 These are the crew of all specific positions: nirmaan main, video / film banaai or shoot kii jaati he
 In this phase more crew is recruited such as property owners, script supervisors, assistant directors, portrait photographers, picture editors and sound editors
 These are all common roles in filmmaking, with the production office free to create any unique mix of roles in terms of various potential responsibilities during filmmaking
 ek vishisht din kii shooting chaalak dalon ke nirdhaarit set / lokation par bulaae gaye samay par pahunchane ke saath hi shuru hoti he
 Actors usually have their own separate call times
 chunki set nirmaan, dressing or liting main ghanto yaa ek din bhi lag sakate hai, isliye praaia: unhen pehle hi taiyaar kar liya jaataa he
 GREEP, power and production design crews are usually one step ahead of the camera and sound departments: for the sake of efficiency, while a scene is being filmed, they are already preparing for the next
 jab chaalak dal apane upkaran taiyaar karte hai, abhinayta apni veshbhusha ke liye vastraagaar, bal or shringaar vibhaagon ke chakkar laga rahe hote hai
 The actors bond with the director to rehearse the script and the camera and sound crew also rehearse with them and produce the final tweak
 ant main, ection ko nirdeshak kii ichchhaaon ke anuroop kai tekon main shoot kiya jaataa he
 Most American productions follow a specific process: sahaayak nideshak sabhi ko yah suchit karne ke liye ki tech rirkad hone vaala he "pikchar ij ap" kah kar bulaata he
 And then says "quiet Abrivan"
 ek baar jab har koi shoot karne ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he, vah "role round" kah kar pukaarata he or production sound mixr apane yantron ko chalaa detaa he, tech kii soochnaaon ke ek maukhik slate ko record karata he or ghoshnaa karata he "sound speed" jab ve taiyaar ho jate hai
 Eddie then says "roll camera" and once the camera starts recording, the camera operator replies "speed"
 The clapper, which is already in front of the clapboard's seven cameras, says "marker!" And jerks off
 yadi tech main atirikt yaa prishthbhumi ection shaamil rahata he to edi usko kataribaddh karata he or sabase ant main nirdeshak hota he jo abhinaytaon ko "ection!" kahata he
 When the director "cut!" Says, a take is over and the camera and sound stop recording
 patakatha paryvekshak kisi bhi nirantarata ke muddon ko note karata he or sound or camera kii timen apni-apni shit par takneekee tippaniyan darj karti hai
 If the director decides that additional takes are needed, the entire process is repeated
 jab vah santusht ho jaataa he, chaalak dal agle camera kone yaa "seoup," kii ore badhate he," jab tak ki puraa drishy "cover" nahin ho jaataa
 jab ek drishy ke liye shooting samaapt ho jaati he to sahaayak nirdeshak ek "rap" yaa "mowing on" kii ghoshnaa karata he or chaalak dal us drishy ke set ko roak dete hai yaa vighatit kar dete hai
 At the end of the day, the director approves the next day's shooting schedule and a daily progress report is sent to the production office
 isamen nirantarata, dhwani or camera tiimon kii report shit shaamil rahati hai
 Call sheets are distributed among the cast and crew to tell when and where the next day's shooting will take place
 baad main, nirdeshak, nirmaataa, anya vibhaag ke pramukh or, kabhi kabhi, kalakaar bhi us din, yaa beete hue din ke photege, jise dalies kaha jaataa he, ko dekhne ke liye or apane kaary kii samiksha ke liye ikatthe ho sakate hai
 With working days lasting 14 or 18 hours in remote locations, filmmaking creates a team spirit
 jab puri film puri ho sakane kii avasthaa main yaa nirmaan charan kii samaapti kii sthiti main hoti he, prathanusaar nirmaan karyaalay sabhi kalakaaron or chaalak dalon kaa dhanyavad gyaapit karne ke liye ek rap party yojit karata he
 Here the video / film is collected by the video / film editor
 film nirmaan kii prakriya main video kii aadhunik upyogita ke kaaran do verient parinaam nikle hai: ek puri tarah se film kaa upyog kar or anya film or video ke mishran kaa upyog kar
