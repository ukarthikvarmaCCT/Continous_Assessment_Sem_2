 According to Kant, we cannot know the personal form because they are restricted by the knowledge of the senses and the rules of the intellect in becoming knowledge imparted by experience and due to being enunciated in all knowledge, these rules are universal
 nitshe kii vyakhyanusaar ye niyam bhi sarvabhaum nahin hote, ve swayan hamaari ruchiyon se, mulyon evam sankalpon se, pratibandhit hote hai

 Hence our knowledge and therefore this world is the result of our "determination to live"
 parantu jivan kaa arth he aatmsatikaran, vistaar tathaa shakti kaa sankalp"
 Therefore, "the determination of power" is the universal truth, it creates our form of knowledge
 shakti ke sankalp kii dharna hi atimanav kii sristi ko prerit karti he jo ki nitshe ke chintan kaa aadhaar he
 There can be no objective criterion of what is moral or immoral
 naitik vahi he jo shakti ke sankalp kii prabalata kaa parinaam ho, aniatikta kaa nirbalata kaa hi prakat rup he
 Due to differences in the amount of "determination of power" among individuals, the outline of society is like a pyramid
 nitshe upar ke vyaktiyon ko shaasha tathaa neeche ke vyaktiyon ko das varg ko maanata he
 The accepted price ranges of both classes are of different types
 ucch varg ke vyaktiyon ke jivan-mulya unke vyaktitv kii kshamta tathaa uske utpann sahaj jivan ke parinaam hote hai, par nimnavarg ke mulya ucch varg ke prati pratikriya ke parinaam hai
 Nietzsche considers Christianity and values related to democracy to be values of the lower class
 ye mulya nirbal vyaktitv kii maansik grathiyon ke parinaam hai
 Among them, there is a desire to drag the best people down
 pragati ke liye nitshe ucch varg kii mulyaparampara kaa sthapit hona aavashyak samajhataa he
 The Hindu varna-system also sometimes seems to suit his ideal, and it is on this basis that he considers Manusmriti to be the best text from the Bible
 maanav-vyaktitv kaa vikaas hi maanav kii kshamtaaon ko prakat karegaa, yah siddhant nitshe ke darshan kii aatma he
 Human instrument is the landing of superman on earth, but this landing will not be according to evolutionism but will be the result of active and careful efforts of human
 sahaj jivan or uske liye swechha se apanaaya hua anushaasan nitshe ke adarsh vyakti kii kasuti he
 One should emulate the best men, not the stereotypes
 ""ishwar kii mrityu ho gai he"" nitshe kii prasiddh ukti he, parantu is ukti ke dwaara vah mulyon main shashwatvaad ke ant kaa tathaa maanav-man main vyaapt anasthaa kaa nirdesh to karnaa hi chahta he
 At the same time, he also wants to clarify that the best man is now the greatest hope of man
 nitshe kii rachanaaon kaa darshanik jagat par vyapak prabhaav padaa
 His book "zarathustra Ki Vaani" is considered among the best literary works in the world
 isi prakaar punya or paap ke aage tathaa "mulyon kii parampara" darshan main naye mode prastut karti he

 The architecture of Jaisalmer has a different significance in the cultural history of Jaisalmer
 kisi bhi sthaan vishesh par paae jane vaale sthapaty se vahaan rahane waalon ke chintan, vichaar, vishwaas evam bauddhik kalpanashiltaa kaa abhas hota he
 The order of architecture in Jaisalmer began with the establishment of the state from the construction of the fort, which continued continuously
 yahaan ke sthapaty ko rajkeey tathaa vyaktigat dono kaa satat prashray miltaa rahaa
 The architecture of this region is expressed by the forts, fortresses, palaces, temples, havelis, reservoirs, canopies and houses used by the common people
 jaisalmer rajya main har 20-30 kilometre ke faasale par chote-chote durg drushtigochar hote hai, ye durg vigat 1000 varsho ke itihaas ke mook gavaah hai
 They had absolute importance in medieval history
 ye rajnatik aavashyaktaanusaar nirmit karaae jate the
 In the construction of fortification, instead of beauty, robustness and safety were taken into consideration
 parantu yahaan ke durg majbootee ke saath-saath sundarataa ko bhi dhyaan man rakhkar banaaya gaya tha
 There is a tradition of keeping the fort in the same main
 durg mukhyatah pattharon dwaara nirmit hai, parantu kishangarh, shahgarh aadi durg iske apwaad hai
 These fortifications are made of concrete bricks
 prayek durg main chaar yaa isse adhik burj banaae jate the
 They gave strength, beauty and strategic importance to the fort
 jaisalmer nagar kaa vikaas 15 veen shatabdi se prarambh hota he
 When residential difficulties in the Jaisalmer Durg appeared, some people started living in the foothills of the fort by building a permanent residence
 bahut kam hi aise nagar hote hai, jinka apana sthapaty hota he
 Jaisalmer is also one of them
 is kaal main jaisalmer shaskaon kaa mughalon se sampark hua va unke sambandh sadaiv sauhardpurn bane rahane se rajya main shanti bani rahi
 For this reason, the activities of trade and commerce started gradually increasing here
 maheshwari, oswaal, paliwal va anya log aasapaas kii riyasaton se yahaan aakar basane lage va kalantar main yaheen bas gaye
 To settle these people, they made mohallas according to their gotra
 aamane-saamne ke makaanon se nirmit 20 se 100 makaanon ke muhalle, sidhi sadak yaa galiyon kaa nimarn hua or ye galiyaan ek duusare se judati chali gayin
 Thus the present city was built
 ye sagotreey, sadharm yaa vyavsaayee mohalle paada yaa mohalle kehalaate the va inhen vyavsaay ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Such as Beasana Pada, the locality of the petals and Churigar living in different neighborhoods of different businesses, different markets emerged in each locality here
 nagar ke purnrupen viksit hone par uski suraksha hetu aay bhi aavashyak prathit hone lage
 As a result, Maharawal Akhasingh got the city park constructed around 1740 AD, which was completed during the reign of Maharawal Mulraj II
 is shahar diwaar main pravesh hetu chaar daravaaje hai, jo pole kehalaati he
 They are called as Gadisar Pol, Amarsagar Pol, Malkapole and Bhaironpole
 ye daravaaje mughal sthapaty kala se kaaphi prabhavit he
 They have wooden doors with large pointed nails, which have emergency windows
 atharahavin sadi ke aate-aate nagar main badhati hui vyapaarik samruddhi ke kaaran vyapaaree, samant va prashasnic varg bahut dhan sampann ho gaya
 As a result, by the beginning of the 19th century, these people started constructing big havelis, bari temples etc
 for housing here
 jaisalmer durg sthapaty kala kii drushti se ucchkoti kii vishuddh sthaneey durg rachana he
 This fort is situated on a 250 feet triangular foot
 is pahaan kii lambaai 150 feet va chaunaai 750 feet he
 Rawal Jaisal established his independent capital
 sthaneey sroton ke anusaar is durg kaa nirmaan 1156 i
 main prarambh hua tha
 But studies of contemporary evidence show that its construction started around 1178 AD
 5 varsh ke alp nirmaan kaary ke uparaant rawal jaisal kii mrityu ho gayi, iske dwaara prarambh karaae gaye nimarn kaary ko uske uttaradhikari shalivahan dwaara jari rakhkar durg ko moort rup diya gaya
 There is no archival evidence of works done by Rawal Jaisal and Shalivahana
 maatr khyaton va tawarikhon se varnan miltaa he
 There are mainly three havelis in the havelis
 patuon kii haveli, dewan salimsingh kii haveli va dewan nathmal kii haveli
 Patu's mansion and Nathmal's mansion in terms of art
 kala kii drushti se patuon kii haveli va nathmal haveli sthapaty kala kaa sarvottam udhaaharan he
 At the same time, Dewan Salim Singh's Haveli is famous for its grandeur and grandeur
 ye sabhi haweliyaan sthaneey pile retile pathar se bani he
 This stone is considered best for excavation work
 ise ghisne par yah atyadhik chikna va chamkila ho jaataa he
 It seems as if passing through the inner and outer layers of any mansion, as if self-evidence is in sight, someone has peeped out of the window of the eyes wearing a pleasant yellow muffle or orbiting the sunshine of the sunshine Applying the eyelid may have killed the eyelids or have developed pudding in the eyes and become yellow mountains in dry sonic sandal sand
 yahan ke lagbhag sabhi bhawan pile, kalatmak jharokhon se yukt, pili chadar main lipte manohari or drushti baandhne vaale
 The viewer's eyes are amazed at the unique craftsmanship of the buildings
 mughal satta ke paraabhav ke uparaant sindh, gujarat va malwa kii ore se kai hindu va muslim kalakaar yahan aakar basane lage tathaa unhone in haweliyon kaa nirmaan kiya
 But if these artisans had come from Gujarat and Malwa, they would have got some original examples of their art, which are not available
 parantu jaisalmer rajya se lage sindh praant main sthaneey kala ke dheron udhaaharan praapt hote hai, jo ki sindh nadi ko paar karte hue baluchistan kii seemaa tak praapt hote hai
 Therefore, it is possible that the craftsmen must have come from Sindh province towards Jaisalmer for the carving done here
 sambhawatah lakdi ke kaam ke liye kalakaar malwa va gujarat se aae honge, kyonki ye donon hi praant is kaary hetu prasiddh hai
 These havelis with sixty-six vents are undoubtedly the best example of art
 ye kul milakar paanch hai, jo ki ek-duusare se satee hui hai
 These havelis are built on a platform 8-10 feet high above the ground and have six floors above the ground and there are 7 floors in total with one floor inside the ground

 The rooms in the first floor were used for the purpose of cooking, storing, watering, etc
, while the other floors were residential

 are seen in these havelis

 Lime has been used very little in havelis
 adhikanshtah khaanchaa banaakar ek duusare ko pighale hue shishe se lohe kii pattiyon dwaara jobia gaya he
 The outer and inner walls of the building are also made of stone blocks instead of stone blocks with rectangular slabs about 3-4 inches thick, which display the high quality architecture of that period
 patawon kii haweliyaan attharavin shatabdi se seth patawon dwaara banavaai gai thim
 He was adorned with the title Patwa, not Patve

 is haveli kaa nirmaan dewan saalim singh dwaara karavaaya gaya, jo ek prabhaavshaalee vyakti tha or uskaa rajya kii arthvyavastha par purna niyantran tha
 The mansion of Diwan Mehta Salim Singh was built over his Pookaini residence

 According to the inscription on the rock, its construction period is 1518 Vikram Samvat

 The Jam area of this temple also bears the marking of Gemini statues with work postures
 ye murti kala kii drushti se atyadhik mahatvapurn he
 Along with the high peak of this temple, many small shikhara called Ang Shikhar are also spread all around

 There is no response to Dewan Mehta Nathmal's mansion in Jaisalmer
 yah haveli dewan nathmal dwaara banavaai gai he tathaa yah kul paanch manzili pile pathar se nirmit he
 The construction period of this mansion is from 1884-85 AD
 haveli main sukshma khudaai mehrabon se yukt khinkiyon, ghumaavdaar khinkiyan tathaa haveli ke agrabhag main kii gai pathar kii nakkashi pathar ke kaam kii drushti se anupam he
 The creators of this unique work were two Muslim artisans under the surname Elephant and Lalu
 ye donon us samay ke prasidv shilpkaar the
 The half-and-half of the mansion was assigned to both artisans with the condition that the two would not mimic the artwork of each other, as well as the repetition of an artwork
 is baat kaa donon ne paalan karte hue iskaa nirmaan purna kiya
 Today, when we look at this mansion from a distance, this entire artwork looks the same, but if we look carefully, the artisans on both sides from the center center of the mansion have subtle frescoes, the immortal work of two craftsmen
 She shows
 haveli kaa kaary aisa santulit va sukshmata liye hue he ki lagata hi nahin do shilpkaar rahen hon
 The mansion is built on a 7-8 foot high platform
 ek chattan ko kaat kar is bhawan kaa nichalaa bhaag banaaya gaya he
 To reach this platform, there are four steps and Diwan Khanas are made on both the sides
 chabutare ke cho par ek pathar se nirmit do alankrita haathiyon kii pratimaaen he
 On entering inside through the huge gate of the mansion, a fourth hallway comes

 is vishaal kaksh main kisi prakaar kii kamaani yaa beam aadi kaa sambandh nahin kiya gaya he
 It is a fine example of the then architecture
 haveli main pathar kii khudaai ke chajje, chhavne, stambhon, maukiyon, chaapon, jharokhon, kanwalon, tibariyon par phool, pattiyaan, pashu-pakshiyon kaa bana hi manamohak akritiyaan bani hai
 Some new figures such as steam engines, soldiers, bicycles, fine carved snails, elephants etc

 The individual components of this type of loudspeaker are described as follows
 diafram aamtaur par ek shankvakar yaa gumbadakaar vinyas main nirmit kiya jaataa he
 a wide variety of materials can be used, but the most common are paper, plastic, and metal
 iske liye adarsh saamagree vah he, jo 1) kathor ho, shanku kii aniyantrit gati ko rokane ke liye; 2) vajan kam ho, taaki kam se kam aarambhik bal kii aavashyaktaa or urja bhandaaran sambandhi mudde kam hon, 3) acchhee tarah se avmandit ho, taaki sanket rukne ke baad isaki prayog dwaara nirdhaarit anunaad aavriti ke kaaran kampan jari na rahe or shravy gunj na ho

 For example, paper is light and generally well-welded, but not rigid, metal can be hard and light, but it is not generally deformed, plastic may be lighter but usually, the harder it will be made
 As much its damping will decrease
 As a result, many cones are made of several types of composite materials

 Metal chassis can play an important role in transferring heat out of the voice coil; Overheating during operation causes resistance to change, which can change the physical shape and destroy magnetism of a permanent magnet if overheated
 nilamban pranali kundal ko antaraal ke bich main sthit rakhti he or gati ke uparaant shanku ko saamaanya sthiti main laane ke liye aavashyak punarprachlan bal pradaan karti he
 a suspension system typically consists of two parts: the "spider", which connects the diaphragm or voice coil to the frame, and creates the recoil force and the "hoop" that aids in concentrating the coil / cone combination, and the magnet Provides most piston-speed optimized with gaps
 makadi aamtaur par ek kadaa karne vaale racin se bhari lahardaar kapade kii discs se bani hoti hai
 The term is derived from the shape of the initial suspension, which consisted of two concentric rings made of bakelite material attached to six to eight folded "legs"

 Modern driver magnets are almost always permanent and are made of ceramic, ferrite, alkino or, more recently, rare soils such as neodymium and samarium cobalt
 parivahan laagat main vruddhi tathaa chote, halke upkaran kii chaah ke kaaran dizin main baari pherite prakaar kii apeksha antim prakaar ke upyog kii pravriti he
 Very few manufacturers still use electrically powered regional coils
 When high field-intensity permanent magnets became available, Alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel and cobalt, became popular, eliminating the power supply problems of field-coil drivers
 kareeb 1980 tak alnico kaa lagbhag vishisht rup se upyog hota rahaa
 khaskar jab ucch shakti pravardhakon ke saath upyog kiye jate hai, to deele sanyojanon ke kaaran hone vaale aakasmik 'pop' or 'clic' se alnico chumbak aanshik rup se vikshetrit ho sakate hai 
 chumbak ke punraveshan ke dwaara is nuksaan ko ulataa ja saktaa he
 After 1980, most driver manufacturers replaced alnico with a ferrite magnet made of a mixture of ceramic and fine particles of barium or strontium ferrite
 Although the energy per kilogram of these ceramic magnets is lower than alnico, they are less expensive and make it possible for manufacturers to make large but economical magnets to achieve the given functionality
 dizin lakshyon ke aadhaar par chumbak ke aakaar or prakaar tathaa chumbakeey paripath ke vivaran bhinn-bhinn hote hai
 For example, the shape of the polar segment affects the magnetic interaction between the speech coil and the magnetic field, and is sometimes used to modify the behavior of a driver
 dhruvagra par sajjit tambe kii topi yaa chambakeey-dhruv guha ke andar sthit ek baari anguthi ke rup main ek “laghupathak anguthi” yaa farade pash shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Advantages of this complexity include reduced impedance at high frequencies, extended high tone output, reduced harmonic distortion, and decreased inductive modulation typically associated with large speech coil excursions

 Large and heavy high-end speaker systems, typically of a size suited for economical transportation outside local areas, are typically built in their target market areas and can cost up to $ 140,000 or more per pair
 sabase kam keemat ke spikar system tathaa adhiktar driver china yaa anya kam-laagat utpaadan sthalon main utpaadit kiye jate hai
 Different electrodynamic drivers provide optimal performance within a limited pitch range

 a full-range driver is designed for as wide a frequency response as possible
 ye driver chote hote hai, aamtaur par 3 se 8 inch vyas main, yathochit ucch aavriti anukriya pradaan karne vaale tathaa nimna aavritiyon par nimna-virupan nirgam hetu dhyaan se dizin kiye gaye hote hai, haalanki inkaa adhiktam nirgam str kam ho jaataa he
 Full-range drivers are most commonly heard on public address systems, on television, small radios, intercoms, and some computer speakers
 hai-faai spikar systamon main vyapak seemaa drive ikaayiyon ke upyog se ekaadhik driveron ke bich asampati driver sthitiyon yaa sankraman network muddon ke kaaran hone vaali avaanchhneeya anyonyakriyaaon se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Fans of wide-range driver hi-fi systems claim that the coherence of sound is due to the absence of a single source and interference, and possibly also to the absence of transition components
 virdohi aam taur par vyapak-seemaa driveron kii simit aavriti anukriya tathaa maamuli nirgam kshamtaaon ke saath-saath unki ishtatam kaary pradarshan tak pahunchane ke liye bade, vistrut, mahange antahkshetron kii aavashyaktaa-jaise sancharan line yaa shring
 Full-range drivers often include an additional cone called the Whizzer, which is connected to the joint between a small, light speech coil and the primary cone
 vijar cone chaalak kii ucch aavriti pratikriya pradaan karata he or isaki ucch aavriti dishikata kaa vistaar karata he, anyathaa ucch aavritiyon par bahya vyas shanku saamagree dwaara kendriya vaak kundali ke saath saamanjasy na rakh paane ke kaaran, vah atyant sankara ho jaataa he
 The main cone is constructed in the whizzer design in such a way that it is more folded in the outer diameter than the center
 The result is that the main cone distributes low frequencies
 The whizzer cone mostly contributes to higher frequencies
 chunki vijar shanku mukhya diaphram se chota hota he, isliye ucch aavritiyon par nirgam visarjan, tulya ekal bade diaphram ke saapeksh behatar hota he
 Limited-range drivers are also used alone, typically in computers, toys, and clock radios

 in anuprayogon main, dhwani kii gunvattta kii praathamikta nimna hoti he
 Human ears are remarkably tolerant of poor sound quality and the distortion inherent in limited-range drivers can increase their output at high frequencies while increasing the clarity of spoken Sabbath material
 ek sabavufar audio spectrum ke sabase nichle bhaag, aamtaur par upabhokta systamon ke liye 200 hertz se neeche, peshewar jeevant dhwani ke liye 100 hertz se neeche or tiechaex anumodith systamon main 20 hertz se neeche upyog kiya jaataa he
 Since the target range of frequencies is limited, the design of subwoofer systems is generally simpler in many ways than traditional loudspeakers, often with a single driver mounted in a suitable box or enclosure
 avaanchit anunaadon ke bina ati nimna mandra swaron ko sahi-sahi punarutpaadit karne ke liye, sabavufar system ko thos bananaa chahie or uchit dhang se ksaa hua hona chahie; achche spikar aamtaur par kaaphi baari hote hai
 Many subwoofer systems include electronic amplifiers and electronic sub-filters with additional controls related to low-frequency reproducibility
 in roopantaron ko "sakriy sabavufar" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In contrast, "passive" subwoofers require external amplification
 ek vufar ek driver he jo nimna aavritiyon ko punarutpaadit karata he
 The driver combines with the design of the enclosure to produce suitable low frequencies
 Some loudspeaker systems use woofers for the lowest frequencies, sometimes enough to not use a subwoofer
 iske atirikt, kuch laudspikar, madhya-duuri driver kii aavashyaktaa khatm karte hue, vufar kaa upyog madhya aavritiyon ke liye karte hai
 This can be accomplished by selecting a tweeter that can operate significantly lower, combining with a woofer that reacts at very high frequencies, with both drivers connected concurrently at the middle frequencies
 ek madhya-duuri spikar ek laudspikar driver he jo madhya aavritiyaan utpann karata he
 Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made from paper or composite materials and can be direct radiation drivers

 a tweeter is a high frequency driver that reproduces the highest frequencies in a speaker system

 a coaxial driver is a loudspeaker driver with two or more combined concentric drivers
 samakshiya driver kai companiyon dwaara banaae gaye hai, jaise altek, tanoy, pyniyar, keief, bmes, kabase or jenilek
 Used in multi-driver speaker systems, the crossover is a subsystem that separates the input signal into frequency ranges suited to different drivers
 driver apni prayojya aavriti seemaa main hi vidyut shakti praapt karte hai or is prakaar driveron main virupan tathaa unke bich vyatikaran kam hota he
 Crossovers can be active or passive
 ek niskriy crossover ek electronic paripath he jisamen ek yaa adhik pratirodh, prerak yaa gaiyr-dhruviya sandharitra ke sangyojan prayukt hote hai
 These parts are formed in carefully designed networks and are mostly placed between the power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signals into the required frequency band before delivering them to different drivers
 niskriy crossover paripath ko khud shravy sanket se pare kisi bahya vidyut shakti kii jarurat nahin hoti kintu vaak kol tathaa crossover ke bich avamandan gunank main ullekhneey kami hoti he
 An active crossover is an electronic filter circuit, which divides the signal into separate frequency bands before power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass
 niskriy filter bhi shakti pravardhan se pehle is tarah se istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, lekin sakriy filtering kii tulana main dridhtaa ke kaaran yah ek asaamaanya samaadhaan he
 Any technique that uses amplification after crossover filtering is commonly known as by-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so forth, depending on the number of minimum amplifier channels
 kuch laudspikar diginon main niskriy or sakriy crossover filtering kaa sangyojan prayukt hota he, jaise madhya evam ucch aavriti driveron ke bich niskriy crossover tathaa nune-aavriti driver sanyukt madhya or ucch aavritiyon ke vich sakriy crossover
 Passive crossovers are usually installed inside speaker boxes and are the most common type of crossover for home and low power usage

 Passive crossovers, like the driver units they feed, have electric carrying limits, insertion losses are 10% often claimed) and loads seen by the amplifier are changed
 hai-faai duniya main parivartan bahuton ke chintaa kii baat he
 When higher production levels are required, active crossover may be preferable
 sakriy crossover saral paripath ho saktaa he jo ek niskriy network kii pratikriya kii barabari karata he, yaa vyapak shravy samaayojan kii anumati dete hue adhik jatil ho saktaa he
 Some active crossovers, typically in digital loudspeaker management systems, may include precise alignment, equalization and dynamic control in phase and time between frequency bands
 kuch hai-faai or peshewar laudspikar systamon main ab ek onboard pravardhak system ke ek bhaag ke rup main ke rup main ek sakriy crossover paripath ko shaamil kiya jaataa he
 These speaker designs can be identified by their AC power requirement in addition to a signal cable from a pre-amplifier
 is sakriy sanrachana main driver sangrakshan paripath or ek digital laudspikar prabandhan pranali kii anya visheshtaayen shaamil ho sakati hai
 Speaker systems operating in computer sound are common and at the other end of the size spectrum, modern concert sound systems where their presence is growing significantly and rapidly

 The simplest driver mounting is a flat panel with drivers mounted in holes
 haalanki, is paddati main, vyarodh ke aayam kii tulana main lambii tarangadairghy vaali dhwani aavritiyaan radd ho jaati hai, kyonki shanku ke prishthbhag se pratyavastha vikiran kaa agrabhag se vikiran ke saath vyatikaran hota he
 With an infinitely large panel, this interference can be completely prevented
 ek paryaapt bade moharband box se is kriya ko kiya ja saktaa he
 Since panels of infinite dimensions are impractical, most enclosures work by incorporating surface radiation from the dynamic diaphragm
 ek moharband antahkshetra ek kathor or vayurodhak box main dhwani ko simit karke laudspikar ke peeche se utsarjit dhwani ke sancharan ko roktaa he
 Measures to reduce the transmission of sound in cabinet walls include thick cabinet walls, decaying wall material, internal reinforcement, folded cabinet walls — or, very rarely, sunken material or thin sheets of lead on the inner walls of the enclosure
 Layer plating is included
 haalanki, ek kathor antahkshetra aantarik rup se dhwani ko prayavartit karata he, jo laudspikar diaphram ke dwaara waapas sancharit ho sakati he- punah jiske parinaam main dhwani kii gunvattta main giravat hoti he
 This can be reduced by internal absorption using absorbent materials, such as glass fiber, wool, or synthetic fiber baiting in the enclosure
 The internal shape of the enclosure can also be designed so that the sound can be reverted away from the loudspeaker diaphragm, where it is absorbed
 anya prakaar ke antahkshetra prishth dhwani vikiran ko parivartit kar dete hai jisase yah rachanaatmak rup se shanku ke saamne se utpaadit nirgam main jud jaataa he
 Designs that do this are often used to extend effective low-frequency response and to increase the driver's low-frequency output
 driveron ke bich sankraman ko jitna sambhav ho sake utana jodrahit banane ke liye, ek yaa adhik driver ke arohan sthal ko aage yaa peeche sarkaakar taaki prayek driver kaa dhvanik centre samaan urdhwadhar tal main rahe, system dizinron ne driveron ko samay-sanrekhit karne ke prayaas kiye hai
 This may include tilting the speaker face backward, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or using electronic technology to achieve the same effect
 These efforts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs
 spikar arohan yojana vivartan bhi utpann kar sakati he jiske parinamswaroop aavriti anukriyaaon main shring or giravat ho sakati he
 At higher frequencies, where the wavelengths are the same or smaller than the amplitude of the cabinet, the problem usually becomes greatest
 is prabhaav ko cabinet ke saamne ke kinaaron ko golai dekar, khud cabinet ko ghumaav dekar, chote yaa sankare antahkshetra kaa upyog karke, ek ranneetik driver vyavastha chunakar, driver ke chaaron taraf avasorak saamagree kaa upyog karke yaa in yaa anya yojanaon ke kisi sangyojan kaa upyog karke kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Most loudspeakers use two wire ends for connection with the signal source
 aisa antahkshetra ke prishth bhaag main stambh par baandhakar yaa spring clip lagaakar kiya jaataa he
 If the strings of the left and right speakers are not connected to each other "in phase", the loudspeakers will fade away
 When given the same signal, the speed in one cone will be in the opposite direction of the other
 This will usually result in the cancellation of monophonic material in a stereo recording, decreasing levels, making localization more difficult, all due to the destructive interference of sound waves
 Where the speakers are separated by a quarter wave length or less, the effect of cancellation is most experienced; Low frequencies are most affected
 is prakaar ke tarakram se spikaron ko nuksaan nahin hota, kintu yah ishtatam nahin he
 Speaker specifications typically include: or vaikalpik rup se: The load exerted on an amplifier by a driver involves complex electrical impedance — a combination of resistance and capacitance and both inductive reactions, which is driven by the properties of a driver, its mechanical speed, the effect of crossover components, and the driver modified by the enclosure and its environment
 Combines the effect of air storage
 adhiktar emplifairon ke nirgam vinirdesh ek adarsh pratirohak bhaar main ek vishisht shakti par die gaye hai, diya jaataa he, haalanki, ek laudspikar kaa isaki aavriti seemaa main pratirodh niyat nahin rahata he
 Instead, the speech coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonance, changes in the electrical and mechanical characteristics of the enclosure driver and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its variations
 parinaam ek bhaar pratirodh he jo aavriti ke saath kaaphi vyapak rup se parivartit hota he or aamtaur par ek voltage or vidyut ghaara ke bich ek parivertinsheel phej sambandh bhi hota he, jo aavriti ke saath bhi badalata he
 Some amplifiers can withstand these changes better than others
 dhwani utpann karne ke liye, ek laudspikar ko ek modulit vidyut dhara dwaara chalaaya jaataa he, jo ek “spikar kundali” main se guzarati he, jo tab ek chumbakeey kshetra banaate hue kundali ko chumbakikrut karti he
 The electric current variations passing through the speaker are thus converted into diverse magnetic forces, which accelerate the speaker diaphragm, which thus forces the driver to produce the same wind speed as the original signal from the amplifier
 puri tarah se ek laudspikar yaa system kii dhwani nirgam gunvattta ko shabdon main nirupit karnaa anivaary rup se asambhav he
 Objective measurements provide information about several aspects of performance to make informed comparisons and improvements, but no combination of measurements summarizes the performance of a loudspeaker system in use, because neither signal used in the test nor There are no music nor speeches
 Examples of common measurements are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs
 frequency; Response to one or more conditions; Directivity vs
 frequency; SPL output, using any of the multiple test signals versus critical intermodulation distortion; Stored energy at different frequencies; Impedance vs
 frequency; And short signal vs
 long signal display
 Most of these measurements also require sophisticated and often expensive equipment for display and the correct decision of the measurer, but raw sound pressure levels are easy to report, So this is the only specified value - sometimes misleading in precise words
 The sound pressure level generated by a loudspeaker is measured in decibels
 laudspikar dakshata ko dhwani shakti nirgam vibhajit vaidyut shakti nivesh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Most loudspeakers are actually very inefficient transducers; Only 1% of the electrical energy sent to the loudspeaker by an amplifier is converted into acoustic energy
 shesh adhiktar vaak kundali tathaa chumbak sangyojan main ooshmaa ke rup main badal jaati he
 The main reason for this is the difficulty in obtaining proper impedance matching between the acoustic impedance of the drive unit and the impedance of the air in which it radiates
 The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers also varies with frequency
 udhaaharan ke liye, hawa or driver main badhate ghatiya milan ke kaaran nivesh aavriti ghatane par ek vufar driver kaa nirgam ghatata he
 Driver ratings based on the SPL for a given investment are called sensitivity ratings and theoretically are similar to efficiency

 Sound pressure is measured at one meter from the output loudspeaker and on the axis, under the condition that the loudspeaker is mounted in an infinitely large space and mounted on an infinite resistor

 For example, a fan's horn produces more sound output in the direction in which it is oriented, concentrating the sound waves from the fan in one direction, thus "concentrating"
 shring vaak evam hawa ke bich pratibaadha milan main bhi sudhaar karata he, jisase ek di hui spikar shakti se adhik dhvanik shakti utpann hoti he
 In some cases, better impedance matching will allow the speaker to produce more acoustic power

 In the following examples, assume that the electrical impedance of the two drivers being compared is the same; Both operate on their own pass bands at the same frequency; And power compression and deformation are less
 pehle udhaaharan ke liye, ek spikar duusare se 3 dibi adhik samvedansheel he, samaan shakti nivesh ke liye do guni dhwani shakti kaa utpaadan karegaa, is prakaar, ek 100 wat driver anumatank ke liye 92 dibi 1wat @ 1 me samvedansheeltaa ek 200 wat anumatank driver 1 wat @ 1 meter ke liye 89 dibi kii tulana main doguni dhvanik shakti utpann karegaa, jabaki dene ko ek samaan 100 wat nivesh par chalaaya jaataa he
 In this specific example, when operated at 100 W, speaker a will produce the same SPL or intensity as speaker b produces with 200 w input

 Combination of high efficiency with compact enclosure size and sufficient low frequency response is not possible
 ek spikar system dizin karte samay teen main se do maanak hi chune ja sakate hai
 So, for example, if extended low frequency performance and small box size is important, low efficiency must be accepted
 This rule of thumb is sometimes called Hoffman's iron rule apane vaataavaran ke saath ek laudspikar system kii anyonyakriya jatil he or bade paimaane par laudspikar diziner ke niyantran se baahar he
 Most listening rooms offer a more reflective environment based on shape, form, volume, and furnishings
 iskaa matlab yah he ek shrota ke kaan tak pahunchne vaali dhwani main spikar system se sidhe aanevaali dhwani hi nahin, balki vahi dhwani ek yaa adhik satahon se safar karke deree se pahunchati he
 These reflected sound waves, when connected to direct sound, are canceled and added at selected frequencies, thus changing the rhythm and character of the sound in the listener's ear
 maanav mastishk inamen se kuch sahit, chote badlaavon ke prati bahut samvedansheel hota he or yahi aanshik kaaran he ki laudspikar system bhinn shravan sthitiyon main yaa bhinn kamaron main bhinn dhwani detaa he
 An important factor in the sound of a loudspeaker system is the amount of diffusion and absorption present in the atmosphere

 Hard-surface furniture, wall hangings, cabinets, ceiling decorations from highly ornamented plaster alter the resonance, mainly due to diffusion produced by somewhat reflective objects resembling the shape of the sound wavelength
 yah kuch had tak anyathaa nagn sapaat satahon kii vajah se hue paravartan ko tod detaa he or aaptit tarang kii paravartit urja ko ek bade paravartan kone par failaa detaa he
 a typical rectangular listening room has primary resonance nodes in all three dimensions, left-right, top-down and forward-back, due to the rigid parallel surfaces of the walls, floor and ceiling
 iske alaava, teen, chaar, paanch yahaan tak ki chah seemaa satahon vaale jatil anunaad avasthaaen bhi hai jinamein sabhi satahen mil kar apragami tarangen banaati hai
 Low frequencies tend to excite these states the most, because long wavelengths are not much affected by furniture combinations or placement
 Mode spacing is particularly important in small and intermediate rooms such as recording studios, home theaters and broadcast studios
 laudspikaron kii kamaron kii simaaon se nikatataa prabhavit karti he ki kitni majbootee se anunaad uttejit hai, saath hi saath prayek aavriti par saapeksh shakti ko prabhavit karti he
 The location of the listener is also important, such that a location near a boundary can have a major impact on the perceived balance of frequencies
 iskaa kaaran yah he apragami tarang pattern in sthanon main sabase aasaani se or kam aavritiyon par suni jaati he, shroyder aavriti se neeche - aamtaur par 200-300 hertz ke aasapaas, kamare ke aakaar par nirbhar karata he
 In studying radiation of sound sources, sound experts have developed some key concepts to understand how loudspeakers are understood
 sabase saral sambhav vikiran strot ek bindu strot he, jise kabhi kabhi ek saadhaaran strot kaha jaataa he
 An ideal point source is a microscopic sound radiating microscopic point
 ek chote se compymaan gole kii kalpana karnaa aalaan ho saktaa he, jiskaa vyas samaan rup se ghatata or badhata he, sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se dhwani tarangen bhejte hue, aavriti se mukt
 Any sound-producing object, including a loudspeaker system, can be thought of as being composed of a combination of such simple points
 bindu sroton ke ek sangyojan kaa vikiran pattern ekal strot ke samaan nahin hoga, balki sroton ke bich duuri or unmukhikaran, vah saapeksh sthiti jis se shrota sangyojan sunata he or sandarbhit dhwani kii aavriti par nirbhar karegaa
 jyamiti or kalan kaa upyog karke, sroton main se kuch saral sanyojanon ko aasaani se hal kiya ja saktaa he, dusron ko nahin
 There is a simple combination, the two simple sources are separated by a distance and the phases are vibrating externally, one micro sphere expands, the other a contraction
 The pair is known as a bipolar or dipole, and the radiation of this combination is similar to the operation of a dynamic loudspeaker without a very small resistor
 ek dwidhruv kii dishikata 8 ank ke aakaar kii he or adhiktam nirgam do sroton ko jodne vaale ek vector ke saath or nyanatam parshv kii ore jab prekshan bindu donon sroton se samdurastha he, jahaan dhanatmak or rinatmak tarangen ek dulare ko nirast kar detii hai
 While most drivers are bipolar, depending on the enclosure they are connected to, they may radiate like monopoles or bipoles
 yadi ek parimit avarohak par arohit he or in pravastha-bahya tarangon ko anyonyakriya karne di jaati he, dwidhruv aavriti anukriya parinaam main sheersh or shunya ho jate hai
 When surface radiation is absorbed or restrained in a box, the diaphragm becomes a unipolar radiator
 ekadhruvon ko ek box ke vipareet parshvon main pravastha-main arohit karke banaae gaye dwidhruv spikar sarvadishik vikiran pattern praapt karne kii ek vidhi he
 In real life, different drivers are actually 3D shapes in the form of complex cones and domes and are placed on the barrier for various reasons
 ek jatil aakaar kii dishikata ke liye ek ganitiya abhivyakti, bindu ke sroton ke modelling sangyojan ke aadhaar par, aamtaur par sambhav nahin lekin duurastha ek golakaar diafram ke saath ek laudspikar kii dishikata ek sapaat golakaar piston ke samaan hoti he, isliye charchaa ke liye ise ek sarlikrut udhaaharan ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 a simple example of the mathematical physics involved, consider the following: Formula for the far-field directionality of a spherical piston on an infinite band p = p 0 j 1 ka sin ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle p = { \ frac {p_ {0} J_ {1}} {k_ {a} \ sin \ theta}}} where ka = 2 π a λ { \ displaystyle k_ {a} = { \ frac {2 \ pi a} { \ lambda xxrep 4 } , p 0 { \ displaystyle p_ {0}} is the pressure on the axis, a { \ displaystyle a} is the radius of the piston, λ { \ displaystyle \ lambda} ie the wavelength is θ { \ displaystyle \ theta} is the axis angle and j 1 { \ displaystyle J_ { 1}} is the first type of basal function

 Later Bose models deliberately emphasized the production of direct or reflected sound by loudspeakers regardless of the environment

 The designs of many other manufacturers follow the same principles

 a speaker that is too direct may result in a tracing area without high frequency, giving the effect that although the measurement on its axis is correct, it is not treble

 Other drivers that diverge from the most commonly used directly radiative, enclosure-mounted electromagnetic driver include: shring laudspikar laudspikar system kaa sabase purana rup he

 natijatan, ek apchaayi transfarmar kaa upyog aam taur par riban main se vidyut dhara badhaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The amplifier sees a load, which is the resistance of the ribbon multiplied by the square of the ratio of transformer turns
 The transformer must be carefully designed in such a way that its frequency response and parasitic losses do not reduce the sound quality, further increasing the cost and increasing complexity relative to conventional designs
 samtal chumbakeey spikaron kabhi-kabhi "riban" ke rup main varnit he, lekin vastav main riban spikar nahin hai
 The term plane is generally reserved for speakers with flat surfaces of approximately rectangular shape that radiate in a bipolar manner

 In addition, the western part itself was divided into four provinces, tribal areas and various princely states, while the eastern part was a province
 iske alaava, purvi bhaag main pashchimi bhaag ke mukaable, vyavastha, naukarshahi va sainya suraksha kii ati nishparyapti thi
 And, the western part was comparatively more developed and had a large army and sufficient bureaucracy and administration
 atah purvi bhaag, jo pashchim ke hi tulanaatmak jansankhya rakhata tha, ke liye vikaas va sampannataa kaa rasta kathin evam pashchim ke mukaable asamya tha
 In such a situation, apart from language and cultural issues in the mind of the eastern side, there were serious questions about the sharing of powers and facilities and the issue of strategic and economic equality
 is bhugolic sthiti se upji prashasnic va asamanta kii kathinaayee, va aarthik noummidi ke samaadhaan ke liye ek vishesh prantiy vyavastha kaa masauda taiyaar kiya gaya, jise "ek ikai vyavastha" kaha gaya, jiske tahat donon hison main keval ek hi praant hoga, atah donon ko baraabar kii raajnneetik shakti praapt hogi
 Also, other development policies were also included in this plan
 pradhanmantri choudhary mohammad ali ne 14 oktob 1955 ko, 30 sitambar 1955 me pakistan kii rashtriya sabha main paarit, pashchimi pakistan ke sabhi praanton ko mila dene ke adhinium ko karyanvit kar, van unit system ko lagu kar diya
 Earlier, it was officially announced on 22 November 1954 by Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra
 is sab ke atirikt, is vyavastha kaa ek or pahalu tha: kai raajnneetigyon kaa yah bhi prayaas tha kii pakistan ke vibhinn kshetreey paramparaon va samskritiyo ko khatm kar ke pakistan ko ek rashtriya samskruti ke taraf le jaaya jaye
 Therefore, from the end of various regional provinces, it would have been convenient to make the whole country a cultural unit
 atah is niti ko prantiy va kshetreey samskritiyon ko khatm kar, ek rashtriya samskruti ko badhaava dene ke liye bhi laayaa gaya tha
 a unit system or one-unit system, was a completely changed administrative system of Pakistan, under which the two different pieces of erstwhile Pakistani land were planned to be governed as "one administrative unit"
 is tarah kii prashasnic niti ko apnaane kaa mukhya kaaran, sarkaar dwaara, pakistani adhirajya ke do vibhakt evam pruthak bhugolic aanchalon kii ek hi kendriya vyavastha ke antargat shashan main aane vaali ghor prashasnic asuvidhaayen, evam bhugolic kathinaayeeyaan bataai gai thi
 Therefore, as a solution to this geographical and administrative subject, the government formulated a policy to establish these two geographical parts as two administrative units of Pakistan within a federation framework
 iske tahat, tatkaaleen mumalikaat-e-pakistan ke, purvi bhaag main maujuud sthiti ke anusaar hi, pashchimi bhaag ke paanchon praanton va unki prantiy sarkaron ko bhang kar, ek praant, pashchimi pakistan gathit kiya gaya, vahiin purvi bhaag ko purvi pakistan kah kar gathit kiya gaya
 Thus, Pakistan became a state divided into just two provinces under a unit scheme
 van unit yojana kii ghoshnaa pradhanmantri mohammad ali bogra ke shasankaal ke dauraan 22 november 1954 ko kii gai, or 14 oktober 1955 ko desh ke pashchimi bhaag ke sabhi praanton ko ekikrut kar, pashchimi pakistan praant gathit kiya gaya, jisamen, sabhi praanton ke alaava tatkaaleen, rajshahiyon or kabaili ilaake bhi shaamil the
 The province had 12 divisions, and its capital was Lahore
 duusari ore purvi bengal ke praant ko purvi pakistan kaa naam diya gaya, jisaki rajdhani dhaka thi
 The federal capital was shifted from Karachi to Rawalpindi in the year 1959, where the army headquarters was, and remained here until the completion of the new capital, Islamabad, while the federal legislature was established in Dhaka
 is niti kaa uddeshy bazaahir prashasnic sudhaar laana tha lekin kai lihaaj se yah bahut vinaashkari kadam tha
 Many states in western Pakistan joined Pakistan at the time of partition on the assurance that their autonomy would be maintained, but the decision to create a forest unit ended all local states

 ke takhtapalat ke baad mukhyamantri kaa pad samaapt kar diya gaya or raashtrapati ne pashchimi pakistan ke vikalp apane paas rakh liye
 Political experts also understand that the objective of uniting all the provinces of West Pakistan was to break the thrust of the linguistic and political unit of East Pakistan
 antat ek july 1970 ko raashtrapati yahya khan ne ek ikai kaa safaya karte hue pashchimi pakistan ke sabhi praanton behaal kar diya
 Pakistan was established after partition of India in 1947
 is vibhaajan ke tahat british bharat ke purvi va pashchimi chhoron par muslim bahul ilaakon ko pakistan main shaamil kar diya gaya
 Also under this division, the Punjab and Bengal provinces of British India were also divided and East Bengal and West Punjab were merged into Pakistan
 vibhaajan ke samay hui khuni jhadpon ne bengali musalamaanon or hinduon ko or bhi vibhajit kar diya
 That Samay, a Muslim-majority district of Bengal, favored partition after the Mountbatten Plan was approved, and he included East Bengal with the Dominion of Pakistan
 san 1947 se 1954 tak purvi bengal, pakistan kii hi ek swatantra prashasnic ikai rahaa, jo nurul amin ke netritv main, pakistan muslim lig dwaara shasit kiya ja rahaa tha
 In 1955, the Bengali Prime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra displaced the province of East Bengal and established East Pakistan, with its capital, Dhaka, as a unit policy
 1954 ke chunaav main pakistan muslim lig ko awami lig dwaara netrit united front ke haathon qaraari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The Awami League took over the reins of East Pakistan by appointing Hussain Shaheed Suhrawardy as Prime Minister of Pakistan
 iske pashchaat aane vaali sattavadikaal ko, jo 1954 se 1971 tak astitv main rahi, aksar bade paimaane par daman, asantosh, or raajnneetik upeksha or agyanta kaa kaal mana jaataa he
 In the 1965 presidential election, East Pakistan unanimously voted against Ayub Khan in favor of Fatima Jinnah
 in chunaavon ko vyapak rup se ayub khan ke paksh main, dhaandhliparrast mana gaya tha, evam aisa bhi man gaya tha kii unamem, rajkeey sangrakshan main, apratyaksh chunaav ke nirvaachak mandal ko rajkeey sangrakshan va dhamkee ke madhyam se prabhavit karne kii koshish kii gayi thi
 This economic disparity between the East and the West, the suzerainty behavior of the West leadership, and the notion that the minority is ruling the West, the majority East, and achieving prosperity, has aroused a sense of Bengali nationalism in East Pakistan
 She did it
 1966 main, awami lig dwaara laayi gayi chah dafaa andolan ne janata ke bich, rajya swaittata ke liye samarthan badha diya, or awami lig issi mudde ko lekar 1970 ke chunaav main purazor pradarshan kiya or purvi pakistan main spasht evam anany bahumat praapt kiya, or isi ke saath, awami lig ne pakistan kii sansad main bhi spasht bahumat praapt kiya After the general election, the Pakistan People's Party denied the mandate of the Awami League to Maan, and began opposing the making of the Awami League
 is sthiti main, tatkaaleen sainya raashtrapati yahya khan ne donon rajnatik dalon ke bich sulah karne kaa prayaas kiya, or centre main, sahyog se sarkaar banane kii salaah di
 This attitude of West Pakistan sparked a fierce revolt and protests in East Pakistan, and the discussion between the two parties failed when Yahya Khan, in the name of Operation Searchlight, ordered military action in East Pakistan
 iske uttar main, awami lig ne 26 march 1971 paurvi pakistan kii swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa kar di, or ek mukti yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, jiskaa samarthan karte hue, bharat ne mukti vahini ko sainya sahyog pradaan karnaa shuru kar diya
 The war that ensued ended on 16 December 1971, when the Pakistan Army based in Dhaka was forced to march by the indo-bangladesh Joint Force, and sign surrender equipment
 is yuddh ne dwitiya vishwayuddh ke pashchaat sabase adhik yuddh-bandi taiyaar kiye the
 Finally, on 16 December 1971, East Pakistan officially declared independence in the name of Bandesh

 saadhaaran vyakti rang ke halakepan yaa gaharepan kaa bhalee bhanti bodh kar saktaa he
 But in this disease, the person's sense of deepness of color or the power to recognize colors is lost
 varnakram ke ek rang athwa rangon ke mishran ke bodh ke lop hone ke aadhaar par rog ke pruthak-pruthak varg tathaa unke naam bhi hai
 Equally colored perception in humans comes from the principle of trinity
 is siddhant ke anusaar rang kaa bodh teen rangon ke vividh mishran se hota hai
 These three are pure and main colors: red, green and blue; Whose different colors are made by mixing different amounts, and these distinct colors have special perception by sight
 yah trivarnataa purushon main praaia: 92 pratishat tathaa striyon main 99
5 pratishat saamaanya hoti he
 This perception power differs from the standard in the rest of men and women in the sense that they require fewer colors or more than the three pure colors for realization of the entire spectrum
 aise vyaktiyon kii vikrut trivarnak kehete hai jinako saamaanya vyaktiyon kii tulana main rangabodh ke liye teenon shuddh rangon kii vibhinn anupaat main aavashyaktaa padati he
 People who have color perception by two or the same color instead of three, they are called bivornic and unicorn respectively
 varnandhta kaa vikaar sabase adhik ekvarnik vyaktiyon main, inase kam dwivarnik vyaktiyon main tathaa ant main sabase kam trivarnik vyaktiyon main paaya jaataa he
 People who do not have sense of red and green colors, they are called yellow and blue pigment etc
 if red and green pigment and yellow and blue colors are not realized
 janm ke varnaandh ko hare rang kii maatra kii sabase adhik aavashyaktaa padati he tathaa aise vyakti ko halke hare or pile rang ke alag-alag bodh main kathinaayee padati he
 Some people do not have a sense of red color, so such people have to face great difficulty in normal life due to this blindness
 yah sach he ki aisa varnaandh vyakti rang kii vividh gaharaai, chamak, tathaa aakaar se hi vastuon ko pahchaan lene kii shakti utpann kar letaa he, lekin aisa vyakti thik thik rang pahchaanane ke gyaan par nirbhar vishyon par nishchay lene main galati karata he, jiskaa bheeshan parinaam ho saktaa he, udaahranarth trephic signal pahchaanane kii galati aadi
 Sometimes blindness occurs due to ophthalmology, such as astigmatism disorder or brain disorder, which can be overcome by appropriate treatment, but there is no treatment of birth blindness

 The set theory is a branch of mathematics that studies sets
 vastuon ke sangrah ko samucchy kehete hai
 Although a collection of any kind of objects is possible under a set, the set theory mainly studies only those related to mathematics
 sthool rup se angreji samucchy ke paryaay 'set', agrigate, class, domen tathaa totality hai
 The components in the set must be different
 pratham shrenee ke tark se suvyavasthit kiya hua samucchy siddhanth aaj ganit kaa sarvaadhik prayukt aadharbhoot tantra he
 The language of set theory is used to define almost everything in mathematics
 samucchy siddhanth ke aarmabhik concept itane saral hai ki inhen praathmik vidyalayon ke paathyakram main bhi padhaaya ja saktaa he
 The modern set theory was started by George Canter and Dedkind in 1870
 kisi samucchyon ke sadasyon ke bare main nimnlikhit chaar prakaar se bataate hai: sabhi sadasyon ko likhnaa ; Leaving some members dot-dot after writing; koi vivaran dena, jaise With the help of algebra; parimit samucchy : jiske sadasyon kii sankhya simit ho, jaise {3,7,9}
 Infinite set: whose number of members is unlimited, eg a = {2,4,6,8, xxrep 13 
 } rikt samucchy yaa shunya samucchy : jisamen sadasyon kii sankhya shunya ho yaa jiskaa koi sadsy hi na ho
 Let it be denoted by ∅ { \ displaystyle \ emptyset} or {}
 ∈ { \ displaystyle \ in } yah chihn dekar bataate hai ki koun samucchy kaa sadsy he
 For example, a member of s = {2,5,6,7,9} is 7
 ise ham likh sakate hai ki 7 ∈ s { \ displaystyle 7 \ in S} iske vipareet ∉ { \ displaystyle otin } chihn yah bataata he ki amuk cheez samucchy kaa sadsy nahin he
 For example, 3 numbers are not members of the aforesaid set S; We write that 3 ∉ s { \ displaystyle 3 \ notin S}
 " ∈ { \ displaystyle \ in } " is chihn ko 'sadsy he' kehete hai
 If all members of a set a are also members of any other set B, then it is said that a is a subset of B
 jaise, A={p,q,r}evam B={p,q,r,s} ho to ham likhte hai ki a ⊂ b { \ displaystyle a \ subset B} prayek samucchy ke do upasamucchy avashya hote hai; ek to swayan vahi samucchy apane aap kaa upasamucchy hota he, doosraa shunya samucchy sabhi samucchyon kaa upasamucchy he
 Write all the subsets of the set {a, b, c} then ∅ { \ displaystyle \ emptyset}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c } And {a, b, c} and zero set
 yadi kisi samucchy main n sadsy hon to uske sabhi upasamucchyon kii sankhya 2 n { \ displaystyle 2^{n}} hogi
 a subset in which the number of members is less than the number of members of the original set is called a 'proper subset'
 kisi samasya main vidyaman sabhi upaadaanon ko lene par jo samucchy banataa he use us samasya ke saapeksh sarvasamaveshi samucchy kehete hai
 For example, an all-inclusive set of all odd numbers up to number 11 would be - ξ { \ displaystyle \ xi \ } = {1,3,5,7,9,11} wain aarekh kaa upyog karke samucchy siddhanth ke bahut si samasyaon kaa aasaani se samaadhaan kiya jaataa he
 The all-inclusive set is represented by a rectangle and all its subsets are represented by a circle
 is chitra main a ke poorak samucchy ko chhaayankit karke dikhaaya jaataa he, arthath a c { \ displaystyle A^{c}} 
 Also, draw circles within the circle to represent the subsets
 jaise b ⊆ a { \ displaystyle b \ subseteq A} If two sets are a and B, their common set will be the set of members in which both a and b are members
 jaise yadi A={2,4,7} evam B={2,3,7,8} ho to a or b kaa sarvanishtha samucchy {2,7} hoga jisko ham is tarah likhte hai: a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B} ={2,7}chitra main wain aarekh main chaaya dwaara jo dikhaaya gaya he vah a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B} he
 a set of two sets a and b is a set of members whose members are those who are in A, or in B, or both
 udaahranarth yadi A={3,4,6} evam B={2,3,4,5,6,7,8} ho to in donon samucchyon kaa sangh samucchy ko ham yon likhenge: a ∪ b { \ displaystyle a \ cup B} ={2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
 If no member is common in two sets a and B, then these two sets are called as disjoint sets
 ise ham aise likhte hai: a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B} = ∅ { \ displaystyle \ emptyset } The components in the set must be different
 yadi x samucchy a kaa koi avyav he, to ham likhte he : x ∈ A
 By not giving details of all the elements, they can also be explained by a rule, such as a set of odd numbers
 b ko a kaa upasamucchy tab kehete hai, jab b kaa prayek avyav a kaa sadsy ho or ise is prakaar likhte hai : b ⊂ a 
 ise yon bhi padhate hai : B, a main samavisht he
 If a has at least one element that is not a member of b and b is a subset of A, then b is called the actual subset of A
 aise samucchy ko, jiskaa ek bhi avyav na ho, shunya samucchy kehete hai or ise φ se prakat karte hai
 Zero sets are useful in theoretical interpretation
 samucchyon par mul kriyaayein ye hai : taarkik yoga, taarkik gunan, taarkik vyakalan
 Logical sums and multiplications follow the associative, permutation, and distribution rules of general algebra
 sambandh ⊆ { \ displaystyle \ subseteq } ke liye falan p { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {P}}} aanshik kramit ho to, sabhi A, B, c ⊆ x { \ displaystyle A,B,C \ subseteq X} ke liye, : The common ∩ { \ displaystyle \ cap} and union ∪ { \ displaystyle \ cup} of sets follow the commutative, associative and distributive rules: antar ke liye nimnlikhit niyam lagu hote hai: The following rules apply for symmetric differences: bicheng zila yaa bai zila janavaadee ganatantr china ke shinjiyang rajya ke aqsu vibhaag kaa ek zila he
 It has an area of 15,889 sq km and had a population of about 2 lakh at the 2002 census

 francisi kranti france ke itihaas kii rajnatik or saamaajik uthal-puthal evam amul parivartan kii avadhi thi jo 1789 se 1799 tak chali
 Later, Napoleon Bonaparte carried this revolution to some degree by the expansion of the French Empire
 kranti ke falswaroop raja ko gaddi se hataa diya gaya, ek ganatantr kii sthapana hui, khooni sangharshon kaa daur chalaa, or antatah nepolian kii taanaashaahee sthapit hui jisase is kranti ke anekon mulyon kaa pashchimi europe main tathaa uske baahar prasar hua
 This revolution changed the direction of modern history
 isse vishwa bhar main nirpeksh rajtantr kaa hraas hona shuru hua, naye ganatantr ev udaar prajatantra bane
 In the modern era, the state revolution of France proved to be the most dramatic and complex in which the Western civilization shook Western civilization
 is kranti ne keval france ko hi nahin apitu samast europe ke jan-jivan ko ast-vyast kar diya
 The French Revolution has been called a milestone in the history of the entire world
 is kranti ne anya europea deshon main bhi swatantrata kii lalak kaayam kii or anya desh bhi rajshahi se mukti ke liye sangharsh karne lage
 This created an atmosphere against monarchy and autocracy in Asian countries, including European nations
 france main nirankush rajtantr tha jo rajtv ke daivi siddhanth par aadhaarit tha
 In this the king had unlimited rights and the king was arbitrary
 lui 14wein ke shasankaal main nirankushta apni paraakaashtha par thi
 He said- "I am the state"
 vah apni icchaanusaar kanoon banaata tha
 He made excessive centralization of power in favor of monarchy
 kootneeti or sainya kaushal se france kaa vistaar kiya
 In this way he made the monarchy a serious profession

 Despite this, the Palace of Versailles remained a center of luxury
 usne kaha ki mere baad pralay hogi
 Louis was the ruler of the 16th on the eve of the revolution
 vah ek akarmanya or ayogy shaasha tha
 He too exhibited demeanor and autocracy

 Which was hereditary
 unki bhartee tathaa prashikshan ke koi niyam nahin the or in naukarshahon par bhi niyantran lagane vaali sanstha maujuud nahin thi
 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative
 vyaktigat kanoon or raja kii ichha kaa hi kanoon lagu hota tha
 As a result, there was a lack of uniform law code in the country and prevalence of different laws in different areas
 is avyavasthit or jatil kanoon ke kaaran janata ko apane hi kanoon kaa gyaan nahin tha
 The existence of this disorganized autocratic and sensitive governance system became painful for the people
 in utpeedak raajnneetik paristhitiyon ne kranti kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions
 francisi samaaj visham or vighatit tha
 That society was divided into three classes / states
 pratham stats main padri varg, dwitiya stats main kuleen varg evam tritiy stats main jansadharan shaamil tha
 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority
 kisaanon kii sankhya sarvaadhik thi or inaki dasha nimna or sochneey thi
 The peasants had to pay many taxes to the state, the church and other zamindars and the feudal tyrants had to bear
 ek drushti se kisaanon ke asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran saamanton dwaara die ja rahe ksht evam asuvidhaayen thi or rajtantr is par chuppi saadhe hue tha
 In this way, the peasants had become so grieved that they themselves turned into a revolutionary element and they needed only a sign to make revolution
 madhyam varg main sahukaar vyapaaree, shikshak, vakil, doctor, lekhak, kalakaar, karmchaaree aadi sammilit the
 His economic condition was certainly right, yet he was angry with the political, social and economic conditions of the time
 is varg ko koi raajnneetik adhikaar praapt nahin tha or padri or kuleen varg kaa vyavhaar inke prati acha nahin tha
 For this reason the middle class hated the social superiority of the nobles and was willing to change the political system and get their rights
 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class
 purv ke vaanijya vyapaar ke kaaran is varg ne dhansampatti arjeet kar lee thi kintu ab saamanti vaataavaran main unke vyapaar par kai tarah ke pratibandh lage the jagah-jagah chungi deni padati thi
 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable
 is tarah 1789 kii francisi kranti, francisi samaaj main asamanta ke viruddh sangharsh thi
 The economic condition of France was in trouble

 On the other hand the tax system was unsatisfactory

 The country's economic malpractices could be improved by encouraging trade commerce, but the government's commercial policy was so uncontrolled and flawed that it did not make possible the development of production and trade in the state
 lui 16wein ne turgon, nekar jaise vitt salaahkaaron ke madhyam se aarthik sankat ko dur kanane kaa prayaas kiya lekin ye sudhaar prayaas lagu nahin ho sake kyonki visheshadhikaar praapt varg ne apane upar kar lagane kii baat sweekaar nahin kii
 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is
 francisi kranti main darshanikon kii bhoomika ke sandarbh main do mat saamne aate hai-ek, darshanikon ne kranti kii paristhitiyon ko janm dekar kranti ko utpann kiya or doosraa kranti kaa strot to us samay ke rashtriya jivan ke dosha main tathaa sarkaar kii bhuulon main tha or darshanikon ne kranti utpann nahin kii
 It would be desirable to understand the views of those philosophers and their relationship with the revolution before passing judgment on any opinion
 darshanikon ke vichaaron kii lokapriyata kaa nirdhaaran to us samay unke chape lekhon ke sanskarnon or prasar ke aadhaar par dekha janaa chahie
 Montescue in his book 'the Spirit of Laws' contradicted the principles of the king's divine rights and offered not only a critique of French political institutions but also an alternative
 usne likhaa ki francisi sarkaar nirkunsh sarkaar he kyonki france main karypalika, nyaaypalika or vidhayika sambandhi sabhi shaktiyaan ek hi vyakti arthath raja ke haathon main kendrit he isliye france kii janata ko swatantraaa praapt nahin he
 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi
 Thus his ideas that Montescue hurt France's autocratic state system through segregation of power became so popular that six editions were published in three years of 'the Spirit of Lodges'
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane kii baat yah he ki montescue ne na to kranti kii baat kii or na hi rajtantr ko samaapt karne kii usne to sirp nirankush rajtantr ke dosha ko ujagar kiya or sanvaidhanik rajtantr kii baat kii

 In this way he firmly believed that the paramount power should be in the hands of the public and not in the hands of any individual or institution
 saarvbhaum satta janata kii ichha main nihit he jise “saamaanya ichha” kaha gaya
 The law of the state should be an expression of this common desire, but the nature of the law is no longer such, but it is dependent on the will of the ruler

 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court

 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages

 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791

 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune

 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized

 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc

 He had more book knowledge

 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc
 yahaan samajhane kii baat yah he ki donon hi gut ganatantr ke himachati the, videshi shaktiyon ke viruddh yuddh kaa samarthan karte the
 The difference was only in form
 vastutah jirodisto ne france main udaaravaadi sthaan grahan kar liya tha
 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prasha and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was referring to the referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives

 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror

 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 In this way, the Directory of Rule in France began after the National Convention which lasted from 1795 to 1799
 atan main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar diya
 This directory rule was disorganized, sad
 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi
 In such a situation, the people of France felt the need for a ruler who could establish peace inside and outside the country and defeat foreign powers
 is kaal main nepolian ne sainya vijayon dwaara france ke sammaan ko sthapit kiya or antat diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar satta par niyantran sthapit kiya
 In 1799, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule and became the first Council of France and declared himself Emperor in 1804 and thus Napoleon's dictatorial imperialist rule began
 europe main france hi vah desh he jisane kranti ke madhyam se puraatan vyavastha ke patan ko sunishchit kiya
 The impact of this revolution was not limited to Europe
 isane samast vishwa ko prabhavit kiya
 The slogans of revolution spread freedom, equality and fraternity throughout Europe
 ek taraf isane jahaan rashtrawaad, janatantrwaad jaisi nai shaktiyon ko panpane kaa mauka diya to duusari taraf aadhunik taanaashaahee or sainikwaad kii neenv bhi daali
 The effects of the French Revolution can be understood under the following points: francisi kranti kii prakruti ko kranti ke aadarshon, kranti ke netritv, kranti kii pragati, kranti ke dauraan laae gaye parivartanon or vishwa par pade prabhaavon ke prakaash main samajhe jane kii jarurat he
 From this point of view, the revolution was a revolution that was started by the elite, then later it came into the hands of the middle class
 kuch samay ke liye yah krantikari tatwon ke prabhaav main rahi or ant ek sainik taanashaah ke saath hua
 In this way, the French Revolution started like a huge river that started from the high mountain peak and crossed several small mountains in the path, at a rapid, if slow, speed
 1789 main hui francisi kranti ko ek burjua kranti ke rup main dekha ja sakaata he
 The leadership in the first phase of the revolution was in the hands of the bourgeois elements of the Third State
 madhyavargeey netritv ne nijee sampatti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch siddhanth bhi banaaen
 In fact, the end of feudalism was declared but feudal rights were not only abandoned, but only after compensating the landlords, the peasants could be relieved of any responsibility
 maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa main madhyavargeey prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 The right to property was placed in the category of natural rights of man which is related to the protection of bourgeois interests
 isi prakaar vayask matadhikaar kii baat to kii gai kintu samvidhan main “naagarik” shabd kaa atyant sankuchit arthon main prayog kiya gaya
 Citizens were divided into active and passive citizens
 sakriy naagarik ve the jo apni kam se kam teen din ke aay kii rakam pratyaksh kar ke rup main adaa karte the or sirp inhen hi mat dene kaa adhikaar tha
 The ability of property to be representative was also made a basis and it was only the rich who could participate in political activities and this meant that the rich people belonged to the middle class
 is tarah francisi kranti ne janm par aadhaarit bhedbhaav ko nasht kiya parantu uske jagah pracheen samantvaad ke badale dhan par aadhaarit nae samantvaad kaa prabhutv hua
 During the revolution, the revolutionaries talked about the loans taken by the autocratic government, but no one talked about forgiving those loans
 iskaa kaaran tha yah rin sarkaar ko burjua varg ne diya tha
 Similarly, the government seized the property of the church but it was not distributed to the landless
 jameenon ko sarvaadhik oonchi keemton par bechaa gaya or is jameen ko kharidne kii kshamta madhyavarg ke paas thi
 The French Revolution ignored the interests of the workers and discouraged the labor movement
 kranti ke dauraan shramik varg ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi kintu burjua netritv ko uski badhati sthiti manjuur nahin thi
 Therefore, the National Assembly re-enacted the laws made in the autocratic monarchy era
 jiske tahat sabhi shramik sangh sambandhi kaaryon par pratibandh laga diya gaye or gildon ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In the National Assembly, the bourgeoisie dominated and the Jirondist and Jacobians also belonged to the bourgeoisie
 yadhyapi jacobiyan sarvhaara varg ke hit kii baat karte the parantu aatank ke rajya kii sthapana main burjua hiton ko hi upar rakhaa gaya or shramikon pratikriyaaon ko dabaane hetu sena kii sahaayta lee gai
 Middle-class interests were also given prominence in directory governance
 sanchaalak mandal ne jis dwisadani vidhayika kaa nirmaan kiya uske sabhi sadsy madhyavargeey buddhijivi the
 The bourgeoisie effect can also be seen on Napoleon's reforms
 usne burjua hiton ko sangrakshit rakhte hue apni vidhi samhita main sampatti ke adhikaar ko surakshit rakhaa, kulinon ko apekshaakrit vyapak adhikaar die tathaa uske vyapaarik or vanijyik sudhaaron kaa phayda madhyavarg ko hi mila
 In this way, middle class elements are seen in the form of revolution
 kintu puure kranti or uske prabhaav ke vishleshan se yah spasht hota he ki kranti main madhyavargeey tatwon ke saath krishak, majdoor, mahilaon kii sahamaagita thi
 In this way, it was not just a middle class revolution, but it can be seen as a popular revolution
 francisi kranti ek vishwavyaapee charitra ko liye hue thi
 The revolutionaries declared human and civil rights in 1789, under which it was said that being born equal from birth, all human beings should get equal rights and this is for all nations, for all human beings, for all time and for example
 Are for the world
 yah ghoshnaa sirp france ke liye nahin varan har jagah ke un sabhi logon kii bhalaai ke liye hai jo swatantra hona chaahate the tathaa nirankush rajtantr evam saamanti visheshadhikaron ke boj se mukti paanaa chaahate the, banaaya gaya tha
 In 1792 AD, the English hero named Kompene was awarded the title of French citizen by the National Assembly and was also elected a delegate to the National Convention
 isi prakaar kranti ke dauraan yah vichaar aayaa ki kranti ko sthaayee or sudrudh rakhane ke liye ise europe ke anya deshon main bhi vistaarit kiya jaaen
 It envisages a war in which French forces enter neighboring countries and meet local revolutionaries and overthrow the monarchy and establish republics
 france kii kranti maatr ek rashtriya ghatana nahin thi apitu siddhanton- swatantraaa, samanta evam bandhutav ke naaron se sampurna europe gunj uthaa
 The effects of the revolution were so far-reaching that all of Europe was covered by it
 isi sandarbh main kaha gaya “yadi france ko zukam hota he to samast europe cheenkta he
 " france kii kranti roosi kranti ke samaan suniyojit nahin thi
 In fact, the Russian Revolution was planned by the Bolsheviks and its aim was to establish the rule of the proletariat by gaining power, but the French Revolution was a victim of events and circumstances from the beginning to the end and the events did not happen in the way that the revolutionaries wished but rather the events gave the revolutionaries Forced to change his path
 stats general kii baithak main yadi tritiy state kii baat anya stats ne maan lee hoti to kranti kaa ruukh doosraa hota
 Similarly, the state of terror and the rule of the directory also did not run in a planned manner
 is drushti se yah kranti avyavasthit thi
 The degeneration of erstwhile French society was also an important factor in the origins of the French Revolution
 puraa samaaj visheshadhikaar praapt or adhikaar viheen virgon main vibhakt tha
 The condition of the peasants was bad due to the burden of taxes, on the other hand they had to suffer exploitation by the tyranny of the feudal and the intervention of the church
 in sthitiyon ne kranti ko raah dikhaai or krantikariyon ne isi asamanta ke viruddh aawaaj buland kii or swatantraaa, samanta tathaa bandhutav kaa naaraa diya
 It was only during the revolution that the end of feudalism was announced, the privileges were abolished

 In fact, during the revolution, a dictatorial government or dictatorship was established under the leadership of Robspier and later the Nepalese also established the dictatorship
 france kii kranti vahaan kii puraatan vyavastha main vyaapt tamaam vikrutiyon, visangatiyon evam buniyadi dosha ke viruddh ek shashakt pratikriya thi
 The revolution paved the way for democratic governance in France by ending French society based on autocratic monarchy inequality, luxury clergy and the crisis facing economic insolvency
 is drushti se ise drushti se ise pragatisheel kranti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he Not only this, the declaration of human rights, the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity and the ideology of nationalism made the whole world aware of the slogan of nationalism and the ideology of nationalism
 italy evam germany ke ekikaran kii bhaavana ko protsaahan mila
 The issue of segregation of religion and politics first arose during this revolution
 rajya or raajnneeti dharm se alag kiye gaye
 France's state revolution enjoys special importance in world history, it is considered an important event in human history
 isamen na keval france balki europe ke jan jivan main amulya parivartan laa diya isamen shadiyon se chali aa rahi saamanti vyavastha ko nasht kar aadhunik loktantric vyavastha kaa maarg praast kiy
 The autocracy of the monarchy came to an end and people breathed peace in the democratic atmosphere
 is samay hamaare saamne yah prashan uthta he ki 1789 i
 main kranti kaa sutrapat anya europe deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi kyon hui
 a study of European nations of the 18th century showed that the condition of France at that time was worse than that of other Europe nations
 nirankush rajtantr suvidha yukt varg or karon ke asaahneey bhaar se dabaa hua tha
 Ordinary classes were present in almost all European countries
 kuch rajyon kii sthiti to france se bhi adhik vikrut thi prasha, austria or rus aadi france se bhi adhik vikrut the
 French farmers were happier than other European nations
 saadhaaran varg kii sthiti anya europe rajyon main or bhi kharaab thi
 Nevertheless, the revolution took place not in these countries but in France first
 iskaa pramukh kaaran yah tha kii france log apni sthiti ke prati jaagruk the
 It is not a necessary condition for revolution that its explosion takes place in the same countries where people are victims of atrocities, incest and exploitation
 samrudh or unnat desh main bhi kranti ho sakati he
 Provided that its residents feel that injustice is being done to them
 france kii janata is anyaay ko mahasus kar rahi thi
 Wanted to get away from it

 There were many reasons for this revolution which are as follows
 frasisi saamanton kaa badla hua swarup or kisaano kii unnat avasthaa- Such was the reason for the advanced state of French peasants and the changed nature of feudalism
 jiske chalate france main sarv pratham rajyakranti hui
 Farmers in the European country were still in a state of gloom
 parantu france ke kisaan swatantra ho chuke the
 They did not own their own land and own their own land in spite of such convenience and feudal services, they had to pay a large part of their income in the form of feudal tax
 or phir bhi uski sthiti acchhee dhi
 They used to buy some land by saving money and the hunger to buy land was constantly increasing, there was a problem of feudalism and unemployment, so they were thinking of removing the feudal occupations, so they got strength under the leadership of the middle class
 And in 1789 AD they revolted
 france main udaar nirankushta kii parampara kaa abhaav- Other European countries also had autocratic monarchies
 parantu vahaan ke samraaton ne samaynusaar apni nirankushta main kami kar di thi
 King Fredirak of Prasha was the great enlightened administrator of his time
 jiskaa anusaran europe ke anya desh rus germany, italy, spain aadi ne kiya
 In due course of time, he tried as much as possible to improve the economic, physical and other fields
 parantu france main is tarah ki udaar nirankushta kaa abhaav tha
 The kings there were doing nothing for the benefit of the people
 balki adhik tex vasulanaa or janata kaa shoshan karnaa unki niti ban gai thi
 Therefore, the French people were fed up with it, so the people of France wanted to end the autocratic monarchy
 maadyam varg kii jaagarukta- The reason for the first revolution in France was the middle class there
 anya deshon main bhi madhyam varg thi parantu ve france kii tarah saanskriti, dhani evam shikshit nahin the
 He lacked strength
 ve raja ke khilaaf baghawat karne kii soch nahin sakate the
 The middle class people in France were dissatisfied with their emperors for many reasons
 or apni raksha ke liye raaj satta par ankush lagane ke liye utawala ho rahe the
 Other European states lacked this type of situation
 anya deshon main netritv karne vaala koi nahin tha france main jaagruk madhyamvarg taiyaar tha
 Therefore, revolution first took place in France itself
 kulinvarg kii anupayogita- The elite Vigyan was given the first privilege to help the king in running the rule
 or ve janaata kii raksha bhi karte the
 But slowly - 2 started doing this work for the king's employees
 falat: kulinon kii upyogita samaapt ho gai
 Yet there was no cut in its prerogative
 isliye kisaan or madhyam varg ke log kulinvarg se ghrinaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries
 vahaan abhi bhi kulinon ki payogita bani hui thi
 The influence of philosophers 18 veen shatabdi main sampoorn europe main boudik halchal machi hui thi
 Philosophers, thinkers, scientists were present in all countries
 parantu unamem mukhya france ke vichaarak the
 Who presented the psychological basis of the revolution
 unhone samaaj main vaypt buraaiyon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrisht karaayaa or muk janata ko vaani di
 Such an attempt was not being made in other countries
 montegu, waltare ruso aadi vichaarkon kaa kaary kshetra france hi tha
 Austria, Prasha and Russia did not have such thinkers
 europe ke anya deshon main logon kaa unki vaastavik sthiti bataane vaala or unamem santosh paidaa karne vaala darshanikon kaa koi varg nahin tha
 This was a major reason for revolution in France itself
 raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaa abhaav- When the middle class became aware in England, they were given the opportunity to participate in the politics of the country
 parantu france ke saath aisi baat nahin thi
 The middle class of France was quite dissatisfied with its emperors
 unki apeksha kii jaati thi
 Despite being educated, they did not have a reputation like the nobles
 unhen france kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, he dissented and raised the slogan of revolution
 ayogy raja tathaa prashasan main bhrashtachar- The political system of France was centralized but the kings were inept
 prashasan main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha
 In other countries of Europe, autocratic rule was broken but kings were eligible and they had full control over governance
 france kaa madhyam varg is prashasnic bhrashtatar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 And so he was ready to revolt
 rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai- At this time, national sentiment began to rise rapidly in Europe
