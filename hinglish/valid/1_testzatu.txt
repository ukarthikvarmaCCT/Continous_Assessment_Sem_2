 The circumstances forced Musa al Mubararaqa to leave the city of Kum and arrive in the city of Kashan
 kaashaan main sabhi nivaasiyon dwaara unka sammaan or garmjoshi se swaagat kiya gaya tha
 The ruler of the city of Kashan, Ahmad bin-abdul-aziz-bin-dalah-azili Musa was highly honored by the arrival of Al Mubraqa and gave him an extraordinary gift every year
 baad main jab imam mohammad al-taki ke kuch premiyon ne kum waapas aakar imam ke bete ke aagaman par hui puri ghatana ke bare main bataaya, to unhen bahut sharminda or dukh mahasoos hua
 The prominent people gathered the citizens of Kum and sent a group to Kashan to apologize for their work and urged them not only to apologize but to bring them back to Kum permanently
 kum ke nivaasiyon ko maaf kar diya gaya or musa al mubraqa ne unke nimantran ko sweekaar kar liya
 In return to Imam Mohammed al-taqi's respected son, a beautifully arranged house was arranged and 20,000 dirhas were offered
 musa al mubraqa apane puure jivan ke liye kum main rahete the or unhone apni bahanon ko vahaan shaamil hone ke liye bhi aamantrit kiya tha

 Just as the six juices of taste of tongue are famous, similarly the nine juices of taste of heart are famous
 jihva ke aswaad ko loukik anand kii koti main rakhaa gaya he kyonki uskaa sidhaa sambandh loukik vastuon se he
 The taste of the heart is considered to be in the category of supernatural bliss because its direct relation bhartiya kavyachaaryon ne rason kii sankhya praayah nau hi maani he kyonki unke mat se nau bhav hi aise hai jo manushya kii mul pravritiyon se ghanishthatya sambandhit hokar sthayitv kii puri kshamta rakhte hai or ve hi viksit hokar vastutah ras sangya kii prapti ke adhikari kahe ja sakate hai
 This recognition has also been controversial, but has accepted the nature of humor unquestioningly from all
 manovigyaan ke visheshgyon ne bhi haas ko mul pravriti ke rup main samuchit sthaan diya he or iske vishleshan main paryaapt manan chintan kiya he
 This contemplation has been given a more elaborate expression by Western poetry than Pravatya poetry, but still it cannot be said that they have studied this element in its entirety and or any such definition of the poetic expression of humor or Haas Has given which can accommodate all types of examples
 bhartiya aacharyon ne ek prakaar ke sutararup main hi iskaa prakhyapan kiya he kintu unki sankshipt uktiyon main paashchaatya samikshakon ke praaia: sabhi nishkarshon or tatwon kaa saraltapurvak antarbhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 Bharata Muni's Natyashastra for humor, says- bhavaprakash main likhaa he- The narrator's statement is- dasharupakkaar kii ukti he- This implies that Haas is a ritualistic gesture and a form of Chittavikas
 uskaa udrek vikrut aakaar, vikrut vesh, vikrut aachaar, vikrut abhidhaan, vikrut alankaar, vikrut arthvishesh, vikrut vaani, vikrut cheshtaa aadi dwaara hota he - in vikrutiyon se yukt hasyapatrata chaahe abhinayta kii ho, chaahe vaktaa kii ho, chaahe anya kisi kii ho
 Deformation means any imagery that is contrary to the expected or singular, some absurdity, which we may find loving, may not be traumatic
 in lakshanon main paashchaatya samikshakon ke praaia: sabhi lakshan samavisht ho jate hai, jahaan tak unka sambandh hasya vishyon se he
 When such a development develops, we get it in a free state, in a simplified form by Kavikaushal, or according to the terminology of Acharya Pt
 Ramachandra Shukla, it is called humorous
 haas ke bhav kaa udrek desh-kaal-paatr-saapeksh rahata he
 If there is an open body at home, the viewer will not laugh, but if he reaches in the same way in the festival, then his behavior will arouse laughter because it is considered contrary or perverse than expected; His behavior will become Haas's mother
 yuva vyakti shringaar kare to fabane kii baat he kintu jarjar budde kaa shringaar haas kaa kaaran hoga; kursi se giranevaale pahalwaan par ham nishchit hi hansane lagenge parantu chat se giranevaale bachche par hamaari karunapurna sahanubhuti hi umadegi
 It has already been said that Haas is based on love and not malice, so if one is to sarcasm at the perversion of one's nature, tendency, temperament, ethics, etc
, it is not as sarcasm but as a proverb
 It will not have a feeling of burning or degrading at the bottom, but a feeling of pure purification
 sanshuddhi kii bhaavanavali yah priyokti bhi upadesh kii shabdaawalee main nahin kintu ranjanta kii shabdaawalee main hogi
 Distinctions of humor have also been considered by the Acharyas
 unhone hasya ke do bhed kiye hai
 One is Athastha and the second is Prastha
 hasyapatr kii drushti se aatmasth hasya he swat: us paatr kaa hansnaa or parastha hasya he dusron ko hansaana
 From the point of view of socials or gentle listeners, or theatrical performers, there is selfish humor without the laughter of others, they have excellent humor and poignant humor
 drushtikonon kaa yah antar samaj lene par in donon shabdon ke arthon kaa vichaar saraltapurvak samaapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Then, the Acharyas have made six distinctions of humor - Smit, Hissit, Visshah, Vashika, Vastha and Vashikaha; Those who do not have to be discriminated but will have to accept the distinction of Hasankriya
 sankshep main, aankhon kii muskaraahat smit he
 Seeing thirty-two sounds is beautiful, the sound that comes out is disturbed
 ang hill uthanaa avahasit he
 The stomach laughter is unheralded and the whirring whirring rib is laughable
 sahityadarpanakaar ne smit or hasith ko shreshthon ke yogya kaha he
 The depraved and the subjugated have been called worthy of the middle class people and the abducted and the oppressed are worthy of the lowly people
 rangamanch main darshakon ke liye bhi hansane kii ek maryaada honi chahie, us drushti se uttam, madhyam, adham kii yah baat bhale hi maan lee ja sakati he
 Otherwise, the laughable laughter will deprive the upper class of public health an important element only by understanding the object of inferiority
 dow ramkumar verma ne uttam, madhyam, adham ke prabhaav kii ishti se hasya ke teen bhed maane hai or inhen aatmasth, parastha se guneet karke hasan kriya ke baarah bhed likhe hai
 Smit, Hasit etc
 Hasanakriya Vriddhas can be said to have a sense of humor
 in anubhaavon kaa varnan maatr kar dena alag baat he or apni rachana dwaara saamaajikon main ye anubhav utpann kara dena alag baat he
 Comicer's successful creation is one that spontaneously produces the feel of humor
 videshi vidwaanon ke vichaar se hasya ke paanch pramukh bhed hai jinke naam hai - humar, vit, satair, irni or fars 
 Humer and Fars are related to the subject of humor, while Bit, Satire and Irony are related to the skill of utterance, in which the last two are not only gratifying but also satisfying
 parody bhi hasya kii ek vidha he jiskaa uktikaushal se sambandh he kintu jiskaa pradhan uddeshy he santushti
 Irony means mockery
 uphaas main, hamaare vichaar se, irni kaa bhi antarbhaav maan liya janaa chahie anyathaa vah hasya kii koti se baahar kii vastu ho jaaegi
 Wit or Vagvayadhyaya can be called a specific ornament
 bhartiya sahityapanditon ne jis prakaar shringaar ke saath nyaay kiya he uskaa dashamansh bhi hasya ke saath nahin kiya, yadhyapi bharat muni ne isaki utpatti shringaar se maani he arthath ise rati yaa priti kaa pariman mana he or ise shringaar ke baad hi navrason main mahatv kaa darja diya he
 It has a direct relationship with Anand and has its own specialness not only in terms of Ranjanata but also in terms of utility
 yah tan man ke tanaav dur karata he, swabhaav kii karkashta mitaatha he, aatmanirikshan or aatmaparishkar ke saath hi mithe dhang par samajasudhar kaa maarg prashast karata he, vyakti or samaaj kii thakaan dur kar unamem taazgi bharta hua janaswasthya or lokswasthya kaa upakaarak banataa he
 It is certain that in proportion to the importance of this comic in Sanskrit literature and Hindi literature, there is a lack of good examples
 phir bhi aitihaasik simhavlokan se yah bhi spasht ho jaataa he ki sahitya main hasyaras kaa pravaah vaidic kaal se lekar aaj tak nirantar chalaa aa rahaa he, yadhyapi vartmaan kaal ke purv usein vividhta itani nahin jitani aaj dikhaai pad rahi he
 The diversity of the stream of humorous can be seen from the point of view of subject and euphemism
 vishay ko ham akruti, prakruti, paristhiti, vesh, vaani, vyavhaar or vastu main vibhakt kar sakate hai
 The absurdity of the figure is obesity, ugliness, clumsiness, mutilation, irresponsible, belly, hump, extreme blackness of women, etc
 inamen se anek vishyon par hasyaras kii rachanaayen ho chuki hai
 It is worth noting that the ridiculous subject of one time becomes the ridiculous subject of all times, it does not happen
 aaj angabhang, nirmutchta aadi hasya ke vishay nahin maane jate atev ab inpar rachanaayen karnaa hasya kii suruchi kaa parichaayak na mana jayega
 The absurdity of nature or temperament is foolishness, stupidity, hypocrisy, blush, bliss, indecent fashionedness, miserliness, pretentiousness, superfluousness, unauthorized egoism, etc
 akruti ke betukepan kii apeksha prakruti ke betukepan ko apana lakshya banaakar rachanaayen karnaa adhik prashast he
 The creators have done good satire on the practices of skirmish etc
, but many subjects have been left untouched in this direction
 paristhiti kaa betukapan he gangamdari joda samay kii chook samaaj kii asamanjasata main vyakti kii vivashtaa aadi
 a very beautiful example of this is the Kevat episode of Ramcharitmanas in which the fools who boast of understanding Rama's heart, but Panditamanya Kevat are unable to answer and in a way surrender silently
 yah paristhiti kaa vyang tha
 The absurdity of disguise has been a favorite subject of the patron nuts and clowns and can be easily given in skits, Ramlila, Raslila, "gammat", slapstick etc
 dharmadhvagiyon vesh, andhanukaran karanevaale fashanparaston kaa vesh, "mardaani aurat" kaa vesh, aise betuke vesh hai jo rachana ke vishay ho sakate hai
 The composition of the absurdity of disguise will also be of shallow status, similar to the creation of the absurdity of the figure
 vaani kaa betukapan he haklaana, baat baat par "jo he so" ke sadrush takiyakalam lagaana, shabdaskhalan karnaa, amanvi dhvaniyaan, shekhi ke pralaap, gapbaajee, panditau bhashaa, ganvaaru bhashaa, anek bhashaa ke shabdon kii khichdi, aadi
 The absurdity of behavior is confusing incidents, clumsy actions, exaggerations, character distortions, social tantrums, having some sense of something, sitting or doing things, puppetry etc
 hasyaras kii abhivyanjana ke liye, chaahe vah parihaas kii drushti se ho chaahe uphaas kii drushti se, vyavhaar kaa betukapan hi prachur saamagree pradaan kar saktaa he
 From the point of view of human beings, why humans, dev demons, birds, bedbugs, brooms, tokens, plate rationing etc
 have been successfully run on many subjects
 parantu in vastuon or visheshat: isht devon evam prashasnic vyangon ke saath majaak jahaan tak pritibhav ko lekar hoga, vahiin tak hasyaras kii koti kaa adhikari kaha jayega
 Other compositions can be reached in the category of raudra, vibhats or other juices
 abhivyanjana main pratyaashit kaa vaiparity anek prakaar se dekha or dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 It cannot be explained exactly with words like absurdity, distortion, confusion etc
 yah vah vaakkaushal he jiske liye rachanaakaar main bhi paryaapt pratibha apekshit hoti he or us rachana ke drashtaa, shrota yaa pathak main bhi
 a social who will not have the desire and hope of humor, will not have humor and humor in the nature and will not have the ability to understand the word signals and syntactic organs of the intellect, it should be understood that there is no humor for him
 isi prakaar jis kalakaar main parishkarpriyata, pratyutpannamatitv or shabd taulne kii kala nahin he vah hasyaras kaa safal lekhak nahin ho saktaa
 Successful authors with the help of unexpected verbiage, with the unexpected derivation of the word; With the help of unexpected unique analogies etc
 With the help of singular arguments; With the help of the various genres of Vagvadagdhya, namely, with the change of meaning, with the art of shifting the place of bathing in the Pratyutra; With the help of Satire "", Uddhav's utterance in Krishnayan is the building of Madhupuri, Shyam Bajai Bainu? Bhavniprasad Mishra ji’s songfarosh etc
), with the help of sarcasm; With the help of illogical vows; And many similar expressions express humor from styles
 prabhaav kii drushti se hamaari samaj main hasyaras yaa to visheshat: parihaas kii koti kaa hota he yaa uphaas kii koti kaa
 We have not limited these two words in the traditional sense
 jo santushti pradhan kavy he use ham parihaas kii koti kaa maanate hai or jo sanshuddhi pradhan he use uphaas kii koti kaa
 There is also a mixture of both in many compositions
 parihaas or uphaas donon ke liye saamaajikon kii suruchi kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 Fleshy ornamental taste, today's modern society cannot be interesting
 devtaa vishyak vyang sahdharmiyon ko hi hansaane ke liye hua karata he
 Suruchi's attention is very important for ridicule
 majaa isamen hi he ki hasyapatr apni trutiyaan samaj le parantu sanket denevaale kaa anugrihit bhi ho jaae or use upadeshta ke rup main na dekhe
 Without sarcasm, consider humor to be ridiculous, whether it is descriptive, whether the effect of the conversation and the effect shown by sarcasm on oneself or others, especially on others, is ridiculous
 bit, humar, parody aadi ke sahare utpann vah haas jo vishuddh santushti kii koti kaa he, parihaas hi kaha jayega
 From the point of view of humor, humor should be considered as the category of softness or that of Attas
 hasith, apasit aadi anya kotiyon kaa inhen donon main antarbhaav maan lenaa chahie
 Two can also be performed of soft-heartedness, one is the secret haas whose pleasure is taken in mind and the other is Sphut Haas whose smile can be seen by other people as well
 attahas ke bhi do bhed kiye ja sakate hai-ek he maryaadit haas jo hansanevaale kii paristhiti se niyantrit rahata he or doosraa he amaryadit haas jisamen paristhiti saapekshata kaa bhaan nahin rahata
 This interpretation of the differences of humor will probably be more scientific
 naatakon main prahasan kii vidha or vidooshak kii upasthiti ne hasya kaa srijan kiya he kintu vah bahumukhi nahin hone paaya
 Many verses of Subhashit have become good, in which both the subject and utterances have a good sense of humor
 kuch udhaaharan de dena apraasangik na hoga
 See the mockery of the relationship of the gods

 It seems that they have also become frightened by bedbugs
 damaad apni sasuraal ko kitni saar vastu mana karata he parantu phir bhi kis akadabaaji se apni puja karavaate rahane kii apeksha rakhaa karata he ya nimna shlokon main dekhie
 Both verses are poetic enough
 jitna vishleshan kiijie utana hi majaa aata jayega: Pranna be dear that life, listen to the conclusion of the poet on this- raja bhoj ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki jo nayaa shloke rachakar laaegaa use ek lakh mudraayen puraskaar main milengi parantu puraskaar kisi ko milane hi nahin paata tha kyonki use medhaavi darbari pandit nayaa shloke sunate hi duhara dete or is prakaar use purana ghoshit kar dete the
 According to the legend, Kalidas stopped speaking after reciting the following verses
 shloke main kavi ne daawa kiya he ki raja ninnanbe karod ratna dekar pita ko rinmukt karen or isapar panditon kaa sakshya le len
 If the pundits say that this claim is not known to them, then one lakh should be given for the creation of this new verse

 Tulsidas ji's Ramacharimanas' Nardamoh episode, Shiva Vivah episode, Parashurama episode etc
 and Surdas ji's Sarsagar's Makhanchori context, uddhav-gopi-dialogue theme etc
 provide good examples of humor
 tulsidas ji kaa nimna chand, jisamen jarajarjar tapasviyon kii shringarlalasaa par mjedaar chutki lee gai he, apni chata main apurv he- Birbal's jokes, Lal Buzhakkad's hanging, Ghagh and Bhadari's epics, Girdhar Kavirai and Ganga's verses, Beni Kaviraj's Bharove and many other compositions are famous of this period
 bharatjivan press ne is kaal kii footkar hasya rachanaaon kaa kuch sankalan apane "bhadova sangrah" main prakashit kiya tha
 In this period, there have been some poignant works, especially about the theme of charity, whose interestingness can not be said even today

 Meteorology or meteorology is a science covering many disciplines which studies the atmosphere
 mausam vigyaan main mausam kii prakriya evam mausam kaa purvanumaan adhyayan ke kendrabindu hote hai
 The history of meteorology is thousands of years old, but there was no significant progress till the 18th century
 unnisvin shatee main vibhinn deshon main mausam ke aakadon ke prekshan se isamen gati aayi
 In the second half of the twentieth century, there was a revolution in this area by the use of computers to forecast the weather
 mausam vigyaan ke adhyayan main prithvi ke vayumandal ke kuch charon kaa prekshan bahut mahatv rakhata he; ye char hai - taap, hawa kaa daab, jal vaashp yaa ardrata aadi
 The value of these variables and their rate of change determine the weather to a great extent
 rituvigyaan vayumandal kaa vigyaan he
 In modern meteorology, physical phenomena occurring in the atmosphere and their associated sub-shells and water-solids are studied
 rituvigyaan ke vishay kaa varnan, jahaan tak uskaa sambandh nichle vayumandal kii mausami ghatnaon se hai, adhiktam suvidhapurvak nimnlikhit chaar bhaagon main kiya ja saktaa he: Mechanical meteorology, which is concerned with the observations and observations by which the weather conditions of the atmosphere are reported
 bhautik tathaa gatik rituvigyaan jisamen prekshit ritu sambandhi ghatnaon kaa gunatmak tathaa parimanik vivechan kiya jaataa he
 Concise meteorology, which is primarily concerned with the study of concise observational observations by concatenation maps for weather forecasts
 jalwaayu-tatv jisamen sansar ke sab bhaagon ke aartav prekshanon kaa sankhyikeey adhyayan hota he or uske dwaara un prasamaanya tathaa madhyamaan paristhitiyon kaa thik-thik pataa lagaaya jaataa he jiske dwaara jalwaayu kaa varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 In the weather observations, which give knowledge of the state of the atmosphere, the following things are seen: vaayu kaa taap tapamapi dwaara napa jaataa he
 This thermometer is kept unaffected by solar radiation
 vaayu kii ardrata gyaat karne ke liye geele tapamapi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 a single fold of wet muslin cloth is wrapped on this thermometer bulb
 ardrata kii maatra sookhe tharmametre tathaa geele tharmametre ke pathyankon se nikaali jaati he
 It is measured by an aerodynamic and it reflects the weight of air on the earth
 pawan kii disha tathaa veg kaa prekshan kiya jaataa he
 The direction is taken from where the wind comes and is marked in 16 or 32 points of the compass
 veg pawan-vegamapi dwaara mapa jaataa he or mile prati ghanta yaa kilometre prati ghanta yaa meter prati second main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Humidity leads to knowledge of the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere and, as stated earlier, it is measured by dry and wet thermometers
 isamen vayumandaleey sanghanan ke sab prakaar ke drav evam thos utpaadan sanmilit hai
 The quantity of clouds and their types, fog and rain, snow, hail, etc
 are observed
 prayek prakaar kaa badal akaash ke jitne bhaag main vyaapt ho utane ko puure akaash ke dashanshon main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Condensation particles that are large enough to fall on the earth in the form of rain
 us kshaitij duuri ko kehete hai jahaan tak kii badi or spasht vastuen dikhaai de sakati hon
 Relates to vertical visibility and is measured by the height of the cloud
 pracheen kaal se hi manushya ritu tathaa jalwaayu kii anek ghatnaon se prabhavit hota rahaa he
 The oldest texts of aerodynamics are Aristotle's 'meteorologica' and the wind and weather works of his disciples
 aristotle ke pashchaat agle do hajaar varsho main rituvigyaan kii adhik pragati nahin hui
 In the 17th and 18th centuries, mainly rules of mechanization and gas were established
 isi kaal main tapamapi kaa avishkaar san 1607 main galiliyon gelili ne kiya or avenzelista toriceli ne san 1643 main vaayu dabmapi yantra kaa avishkaar kiya
 After these inventions, the Law of Vials was invented in 1659
 san 1735 main george headley ne vyapaarik vaayu kii vyakhya prastut kii tathaa usamen headley ne vyapaarik vaayu kii vyakhya prastut kii tathaa usamen sabase pehle vayumandaleey pawanon par prithvi ke chakkar ke prabhaav ko sammilit kiya
 The foundation of modern meteorology became established when Anthony Lavosie gained knowledge of the true nature of the atmosphere in 1783 and John Doulton in 1800 highlighted the changes in the atmosphere and the relation of air diffusion and atmospheric condensation
 19veen shatabdi main vikaas adhiktar sankshipt rituvigyaan ke kshetra main hua
 Many countries established meteorological institutions and opened seasonal observatories
 is kaal main ritu purvanumaan kii disha main bhi paryaapt vikaas hua
 In the first half of the 20th century, due to the increase in observations of wind velocity and direction, etc
 up to a height of 20 kilometers, the information received by the meteorologists was more advanced in meteorology
 upree vaayu ke aise prekshanon se rituvigyaan kii anek samasyaon ko samajhane main bahut adhik sahaayta mili
 During the First World War period, more and quicker observations of atmospheric conditions were required, for which arrangements were made to take up meteorological instruments by aircraft

barkaneez ech
 solvarg tathaa je
 barkaneez dwaara dhraveey agrasiddhant ke tathaa chakravaaton kii utpatti ke tarang siddhant ke parinaam hai
 In the Second World War period, the demand for weather information mainly for the use of high-flying airplanes increased and the radar method was developed for the knowledge of the velocity and direction of air, etc
 at different heights, to meet this demand
 nichle vayumandal kii sukhi vaayu main anek gaison kaa mishran hota he jinamein mukhyat: nitrogen 78 pratishat, oxijan 21 pratishat, aragan 0
93 pratishat or carbon diaksaide 0
03 pratishat hoti hai
 In addition to these gases, there are other gases, such as hydrogen and ozone
 pawanon dwaara nichle vayumandal ke lagaataar mishran se tathaa urdhwadhar sanvahan se sukhi hawa kaa mishran itnaa aparivarti rahata he ki kam se kam 20 kilometre kii oonchaai tak to sukhi hawa kaa anubhaar 28

276 3 gram prati ghan sein
 hota he, jab vaayu daab 1,000 milibaar ho or taap 0° centegrade ho
 The presence of ozone in the atmosphere was confirmed by Fowler and Strutt with a spectroscope
 dobson ke prekshanon se bhi yah baat siddh ho gai he tathaa yah gyaan bhi praapt hua he ki ozone bhootal se lagbhag 30 se 40 kilometre kii oonchaai par ek simit str main pai jaati he
 The presence of ozone at these elevations is somewhat important for seasonal conditions
 dobson kii khoj se pataa laga he ki 10 kilometre oonchaai par kii vayudab main or ozone kii maatra main ghanishtha sambandh he
 In the atmosphere, only water vapor is the element whose physical state changes under normal atmospheric conditions
 at: vayumandal main jalawaashp kii pratishat aaytan maatra bahut ghatati badhati rahati he
 Increasing the occurrence of water vapor in the atmosphere is extremely important for meteorology
 jal kaa vashpikaran tathaa sanghanan isliye mahatvapurn he ki na keval inase ek sthaan se duusare sthaan ko jal kaa parivahan hota he, varan isliye bhi ki jal ke vashpikaran ke liye gupt ushma ke avasorana kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It finally reappears and is used to heat the air when condensation of water vapor occurs again in condensation and snow
 yadhyapi nitrogen gas ammonia, nitric amla tathaa nitreton kaa mukhya avyav he or ye padaarth barood aadi main bahut mahatv rakhte hai, tathaapi vayumandal main yah gas bilkul niskriy rahati he
 This only attenuates oxygen gas, the more important component of the atmosphere, which is about one fifth of the atmosphere
 kisi bhi sthaan kii vayudab vahaan ke upar kii vaayu ke bhaar se utpann hoti he, isliye do vibhinn unchaaiyon kii vayudabon kaa antar in donon unchaaiyon ke bich kii hawa ke ekank anuprastha kaat ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 If this pressure difference is not exactly balanced by the weight of the middle air, then that air level receives acceleration upwards or downwards
 jis paristhiti main daab kaa antar or vaayu kaa bhaar santulit ho, athwa yon kahie ki gurutvajanit twaran ke atirikt koi anya urdhwadhar twaran vidyaman na ho, vah dravasthaitik santulan kii paristhiti kehalaati he
 This situation shows the rate of pressure change at any level with height
 yadi do dabastaron ke bich kaa daab antar ho or donon staron ke bich urdhwadhar duuri ho, ghanatv ho or gurutvajanit twaran ho, to This equation is called the hydrostatic equation
 gurutvajanit twaran vibhinn akshansh tathaa oonchaai ke kaaran thodaa sa hi ghatata badhata he, kintu daab, taap tathaa nami ke kaaran vaayu kaa ghanatv adhik maatra main ghatata badhata he
 Therefore, the vertical pressure in the atmosphere is highly variable
 68 kimi ke neeche daab kii ganana ke liye do sutara prayog main laaye jate hai
 The first formula is used when the standard temperature LSP rate is not zero
 duusare kaa prayog tab karte hai jab maanak taap leps dar shunya ho
 First equation: doosraa sameekaran: Where Or converted to English units: Where oonchaai maapne kii pramanik vidhi yah he ki upar die hue sutara dwaara daab tathaa taap maapkar oonchaai kaa antar praapt kiya jaae or yadi yatharthata kii aavashyaktaa ho to ardrata kii maatra ko bhi kaam main laayaa jaae
 The authentic altimeter is based on this formula
 din ke samay surya se garmi milane or raat main vikiran dwaara prithvi ke thandi hone se vaayu ke taap main dainik parivartan utpann hota he
 The minimum temperature is slightly before sunrise and the maximum temperature is in the third hour
 vaayu ke taap kaa yah dainik parivartan bhootal ke upar se mukt vayumandal main shighrata se ghatata he
 The daily range of heat has not been found to exceed 2 ° or 3 ° c in most parts of the earth at altitudes of more than 5,000 feet and in desert regions at 10,000 feet
 bhootal tathaa vayumandal ko garmi lagbhag purnataya surivikiran se hi milti he
 Heat is very less than other celestial bodies
 saura urja kii maapen smithsonian sanstha kii tara-bhautikee-vedhashala main tathaa anya kai parvatshikharon par sthit vedhashalaon main niyamit rup se kii jaati he or in maapon kii yatharthata ek pratishat se utkrisht hoti he
 This solar insolation energy is about 1
94 grams per square square centimeter per minute before entering the atmosphere at a moderate distance between the Earth and the Sun; The restriction here is that the rays of the sun fall on that square centimeter
 is maatra ko saura niyatank kehete hai
 Irregular curves found in the value of solar constant are less than one percent; These can be caused by observations
 in aniyamit ucchavachanon ke atirikt ek vaastavik or bada ucchavachan bhi paaya gaya he jo gyaarah varshiya surya-kalank-chakra main lagbhag pratishat tak kaa dirghakaalik ucchavachan or bhi ho saktaa he
 But all these reliefs are so small that in relation to atmospheric thermal equilibrium, it can be assumed that solar energy on Earth is 1
94 grams per square centimeter per minute
 anumaan kiya gaya he ki saura urja kaa 43 pratishat bhaag paravartit tathaa prakirnit tathaa prakirnan karne kii sammilit shakti ko albedo kehete hai
 This is 43 percent
 shesh 57 pratishat urja, jo prabhavakaari aatapan he, bhootal tathaa vayumandal ko ausatan 57 ushma ikaiyaan pradaan karata he
 Out of these 57 heat units, only a small part of the atmosphere is absorbed by the atmosphere, mainly by water vapor in the lower levels and by ozone in the upper stratosphere to a lesser extent
 vayumandal main vaashpan tathaa sanghanan kaa kaaran he vaayu kii jalawaashp grahan karne kii shakti main kami beshi, arthath ardra vaayu kaa garam yaa sheethal hona
 Generally the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is less than the saturated volume, especially near the ground floor where the effective insolubility of the atmosphere is maximum
 vaayu main nami kaa adhik bhaag, jo vayumandal main jalawashpachakr ko chalaata rahata he, vaashpan se praapt hota he
 As the water evaporates, it continues to diffuse into the atmosphere
 vayumandal main vaashpan dwaara honevaali mausami kriyaayein apekshaakrit mahatvapurn nahin hotin
 The evolution of visible steam is also a seasonal activity by evaporation
 garam jal kii sataha se shighratapurvak vaashpan hone ke kaaran bahut thandi athwa apekshaakrit thandi ardra vaayu ekadam ati santrupt ho jaati he
 This results in instant condensation of moisture in the form of visible steam, causing a dense fog in the stagnant air
 sanghanan kisi khuli sataha par us samay hota he jab us sataha kaa taap aasapaas kii vaayu ke osank ke taap se kam hota he
 Examples of this type of condensation are found in hot climates
 jaise, yadhyapi vaayu kii aapekshik ardrata sau pratishat se paryaapt kam rahane par bhi barf ke pani se bhare gilaas ke baahar vaayu kaa vaashp sanghanit ho jaataa he usee prakaar svachh prashanth raatri main os kaa sanghanan un bhootalsthit vastuon par ho jaataa he jo apni ooshmaa ke vikiran ke kaaran aasapaas kii vaayu ke osank se nimna taap tak thandi ho jaati hai, paala un satahon par jamata he jo hinma se bhi adhik thandi ho jaati hai, chaahe mukt vaayu kaa taap himank se kaaphi unchaa kii kyon na ho
 When condensation takes place in the form of small short bursts within the atmosphere, the question arises as to how this process begins
 prayog se siddh hua he ki purnat: ashuddhiheen vaayu main sanghanan jalbindu ke rup main nahin hota, chaahe usamen vashpadaab santrupti daab se das guni hi kyon na ho
 It seems that some kind of particles are not required to start condensation of water vapor which is not present in pure air
 is prakaar ke kan ko sanghanan nabhik kehete hai
 Tests have revealed that tiny particles of hydrophobic substances in the air, such as sea salt particles, act as condensation nuclei
 jin sthanon main kaarkaanon kaa dhuaan vayumandal ko dooshit kar detaa he, vahaan dhuen ke gandhak, phosforus aadi padaartho ke oxide ke nanhen kan sanghanan nabhik ban jate hai
 Generally, the fog and clouds of the lower troposphere contain tiny tobodies, ranging from hundred to ten thousand per cubic centimeter
 badalon main vashabindu athwa duusare varshanakan kis prakaar nirmit hote hai, yah vishay abhi sanshayyukt he
 Perhaps they are formed by combining many small clouds
 sangyojan vaayu kii dhaaraon ke milane or vaayu ke math uthne se hota hoga
 The accepted theory about intense precipitation with large dots is that these dots are formed when glaciers reach the upper parts of clouds where extreme cold water prevails
 is siddhant kaa pratipaadan tii vargraan ne kiya tha
 Basically, the normal circulation of the atmosphere arises due to the horizontal temperature between the Mediterranean and the polar countries

 If long-term daily seasonal maps are tested, it is known that there are two types of flow forms in them: alpajivi shighragami pratichakravaat tathaa avdaab 
 After this type of whirlpool starts from one day to one month it ends and then becomes completely invisible with maps
 ye gaun sanchaar naam se prasiddh hai
 Long-lived and slowly moving whirlpools

 These are called primary communication
 chitra 1 or 2 main janvari or july ke maheenon main prithvi par ausat samudrastareey dabrekhaayen di gai hai
 It is clear that the two images in the two pictures are similar in some respects
 donon maheenon main prithvi ke samast bumadhyarekhiy pradesh main ek apekshaakrit alp, kintu atyant ekasmaan, daab kaa akhand katibandh he
 In the January month it is somewhat north of the tropical equator, but in July month it is either exactly on that line or slightly south

 We can call this entire tropics equatorial tropics

 This wide tropics is called the subtropical overgrowth which is a permanent form of normal communication in both hemispheres
 uposhnavalayik adhidaab katibandh ke dakshin main vayudab dakshin kii ore baraabar girti jaati he or antarctic mahadweep ke upar nunatam ho jaati he
 The following three primary pressure zones are introduced in the Northern Hemisphere: bumadhyarekhiy alpadaab katimbdh, jo donon golardhon main samaan rup se vidyaman rahata he
 The subtropical overpressure is completely different in this hemisphere
 janvari maas main yah samudron par lagbhag 25°-35° uttar main rahata he
 But in high latitudes above the continents, it is related to systems of high pressure
 ye dabpranaliyaan lakshan main ekadam bhinn hoti hai or isliye uposhnavalayik adhi-daab-katibandh ko samudron tak hi simit samajhnaa uchit he
 The sub-dipole tropic tropics are clearly visible on the map of January month
 is katibandh main do bade alpadaab kshetra iceland tathaa alusian dwipon par hai, jo krmanusaar uttartam atlantic mahaasaagar par tathaa uttartam pacific mahaasaagar par vistrut hai
 In between these two areas there is an area of relatively high pressure on the pole
 greeshm ritu main ye alpadaab bahut ksheen hote hai
 The Alushian region then disappears
 dhruvon par vayudab apekshaakrit adhik rahati he
 The discrepancy in the integrity of the subtropical overgrowth and subipolar torsion is due to new and unknown elements that are lacking in the Southern Hemisphere
 gaun sanchaar chaahe pratichakravaati hon yaa chakravaati, unka lakshan yah he ki ek yaa adhik samadab rekhaayen adhidaab kendron yaa alpadaab kendron ko chaaron ore se gherkar band kar detii hai
 Thus the overload area and the low pressure area are the local areas of excess or decrease of the weight of the atmosphere in order
 gaun sanchaar do prakaar ke hote hai : pratyaksht: ushmiya or gatik athwa pranodith 
 Thermal overgrowth and under pressure are usually caused by the cooling or heating of a particular part of the lower atmosphere
 gatik adhidaab tathaa alpadaab donon hi saamaanya sanchaar kii vayudharaon kii parsparik yantric kriyaaon ke kaaran nirmit hote hai
 Evidently thermal secondary communications include the flow and thermodynamic effects

 Now this word has also been applied to some other winds which are long and regular in different directions of the year from adverse directions
 in pawanon ke chalane kaa praathmik kaaran thal tathaa samudri kshetron ke tapon kaa ritujanit antar he
 They resemble the wind land and the hydropower, but they have a duration of one year instead of one day and they run on very wide areas rather than limited areas
 monsoon ko hindi main pawas kehete hai
 Meteorological changes of heat near the equator are generally too small for the growth of the monsoon
 unche akshanshon main, jahaan pachhuva pawan chalata he or dhruviya pradeshon main, thal or samudr ke taap kii vibhinnata se bane vataghat prithvivyapee pavansancharon ko keval thodaa sa hi badalane main samarth hote hai
 In such a situation, the regions most favorable for the development of the monsoon are in the middle latitudes near the incubation
 sthal kii ore chalanevaale pawanon main vidyaman ardrata kii maatra kaa tathaa sthal kii ruparekha kaa pawasvarsha par atyant prabhaav padataa he
 Due to the aforementioned consistency of various events, the maximum growth of the monsoon is on East and South Asia and in many parts of these regions, the southwestern summer moving monsoon is an important part of the climate

 Apart from the southern parts of South Pradesh, where these winds do not reach due to the cover of the hills of the Western Ghats, all parts of India receive heavy rainfall during the monsoon period
 yah varsha lagbhag purnataya sanvahneey hoti he
 For its progress, the conversion of vapor into water is controlled mainly by the heating of the surface and its height
 bhumital kii uthaan kaa prabhaav pashchimi ghaaton main, khaasi kii pahadiyon main, arakaan kii chotiyon main tathaa himalay parvat par bhalee bhanti dikhaai padataa he
 There is excessive rainfall in these parts
 kabhi kabhi gangaghati kii droni main bahut der tak vistrut varsha hoti rahati he
 This continuous rainfall is often due to the shallow avalanches which run at a slow speed in the west direction towards the main footfall
 bhartiya pawas kii shakti bahut ghatati badhati rahati he
 When the monsoon is intense, the rainfall in most parts of India is much higher than the average and the rainfall is less when the monsoon is light
 pawas kaa uttar kii ore badhanaa himalay pahaad ke kaaran simit ho jaataa he, parantu pawas kaa pravaah burma, thailand, indochin tathaa dakshin china main bahut pravichhinn rahata he
 The high hills situated near the axis of this peninsula are covered with dense convection clouds and there is frequent rainfall

 Therefore, much attention has been paid to the development of statistical long-term weather forecast in this country and statistical methods are being used in relation to the short-term changes of the Indian monsoon

 In the next five centuries of his Mahaparinirvana, Buddhism spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and in the next two thousand years also spread across the central, eastern and southeastern Jambu continent

 Buddha's real name was Siddhartha
 unka janm kapilwastu ke paas lumbini main hua tha
 In this place, Emperor Ashoka built a pillar in the memory of Buddha in the third century BC
 siddharth ke pita shaakyon ke raja shuddhodan the
 According to the traditional tale, Siddhartha's mother Mahamaya died some time after his birth
 kaha jaataa he ki unka naam rakhane ke liye 8 rishiyo ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, sabhi ne 2 sambhaavnaayen bataai thi, ve ek mahaan raja banenge ve ek sadhu yaa parivrajak banenge
 Hearing this speech, King Shuddhodana tried hard not to allow Siddhartha to become a monk to the extent of his ability
 shaakyon kaa apana ek sangh tha
 At the age of twenty, every Shakya Tarun had to be initiated into Shakya Sangha and become a member of the Sangh
 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana
 bharat main buddha dharm kaa navyan sampradaay he jo purnat shuddh, maanavtaavaadi or vigyaanvaadee he
 Template: Main: Theravada saanchaa:main:mahayan Template: Main: Vajrayana saanchaa:main:navyan Five main shrines are considered to be main for followers of Lord Buddha around the world: yah sthaan nepal kii tarai main nautanwaan railway stesan se 25 kilometre or gorakhpur-gonda line ke naugarh stesan se kareeb 12 kilometre dur he
 Now a paved road has also been built from Naugarh to Lumbini
 isa purv 563 main rajkumaar siddharth gautam kaa janm yaheen hua tha
 However, most of the ancient viharas of Buddha's time here have been destroyed
 keval samraat ashok kaa ek stambh avshesh ke rup main is baat kii gavaahi detaa he ki bhagwaan buddha kaa janm yahaan hua tha
 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
 iske baad ve gaya pahunche
 In the end, he vowed that until real knowledge is available, he will not rise from under the Peepal tree, even if he dies
 iske baad kareeb chah din tak din raat ek pipal vriksh ke neeche bhukhe-pyaase tap kiya
 Eventually he attained supreme knowledge or wisdom

 Scenic objects of Sarnath include Chaturmukh Singh pillar of Ashoka, ancient temple of Lord Buddha, Dhamek Stupa, Chaukhandi Stupa, etc

 rashtrawaad or aadhunik rajya ke itihaas ke bich ek sanrachanagat sambandh he
 Around the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a modern state emerged in Europe which played the most important role in the rise of nationalism
 rajya kaa yah rup apane pehle ke roopon se bhinn tha
 Its power was centralized, sovereign and undivided
 iske vipareet madhyayugin europe main rajasatta kisi ek samprabhu shaasha yaa sarkaar ke paas rahane ke bajaay banti hui thi
 The modern state ended this division of power on the basis of which the idea of nationalism could flourish

 Emperors and dynasties existed in the Middle Ages, but had to share power with the church horizontally and with the feudal lords and subedar powerfully
 carch itnaa taqatvar tha ki vah hukmaranon jitna or kabhi-kabhi unase bhi zyaada taqatvar hua karata tha
 Since the Roman emperor Constantine adopted Christianity in the fourth century, the power of the Church had steadily increased
 rajkeey dharm ho jane ke kaaran isiyat kaa prasar na keval europe ke kone-kone main ho gaya, balki purv main turki or rus tak failata chalaa gaya
 By the sixth century, structures of overlapping power had developed between Catholic churches and rulers in Europe
 raajaaon kaa daawa yah tha ki ve daivi aadesh se hukumat kar rahe hai or duusari taraf carch gair-dharmik arthon main ek had tak raajnneetik bagdor apane haath main rakhata tha
 The Church had the authority to tax the subjects

 In marriages between the royal families, the entire area of land was given as dowry and gifts, which made the people of one area become subjects of another state overnight

 There was no restriction on movement of people from one area to another

 Politics, administration, law and culture used to go on in a decentralized manner

 The first Russian chemist Mendeleeff introduced the periodic rule in 1869 and presented the elements as a table
 iske kuch maheenon baad german vaigyanik lother meyar ne bhi swatantra rup se aavart sarini kaa nirmaan kiya
 Alfred Werner created the current form of the periodic table from Mendeleev's table

 The periodic table is very important and useful for chemists
 iske kaaran kam tatwon ke gundharmon ko hi yaad rakhane se kaam chal jaataa he kyonki aavart sarini main kisi samooh yaa kisi aavart main gundharm ek nishchit kram se evam tarksmmat tareeke se badalte hai
 The modern form of the periodic table is shown below, which consists of 18 squares and 7 periods
 aavart sarini ke is prachlit prabandh main lanthanide or actenide ko anya dhaatuon se alag rakhaa gaya he
 F-block and g-block metals are also managed together in detailed and very detailed periodic tables
 aavart sarini main tattvon kii shreniyan Sorting in incremental order of atomic weights of elements yield horizontal rows called 'periodic'
 aavart niyam ke anusaar tatwon ko parmaanu bhaar ke vruddhi kram main kshaitij kataron main sajaane par saaman gun vaale tatv ek hi urdhvadhar kalam main upasthit rahete hai, inhen 'varg' kehete hai
 The upward lines of the periodic table are called 'groups' or 'squares'
 tatwon ke vargeekaran kii drushti se samoohon ko sabase mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 In some groups, the elements show similar properties
 in samoohon ke naam kshareey tatv, kshareey parthiv dhaatu, hellogen, nictogen, chalcogen or akriy gas
 The horizontal lines of the periodic table are called periodic
 haalanki tatwon ke vargeekaran main samooh adhik mahatvapurn maane jate hai, phir aavart sarini main kai sthal aise hote hai jahaan aavart kaa mahatv adhik ho jaataa he
 D-blocks or transition metals and F-blocks can be taken as an example
 aadhunik aavart sarini ko aavart sarini kaa deergh rup bhi kehete hai
 It has 18 squares and 7 periods
 kisi ek varg ke sabhi tattvon ke parmaanuon ke sabase bahari kaksha main electranon kii sankhya samaan hoti he
 Because of this, all the elements of a single class have the same main properties

 The first Russian chemist Mendeleeff introduced the periodic rule in 1869 and presented the elements as a table
 iske anusaar, That is, if the elements are kept in atomic weight increments, then the elements whose properties are equal come after a certain period

 He eliminated the categories present in Mendelive's periodic table and increased the number of classes from 9 to 18
 iske baad bhi hydrogen kaa do sthanon par hona or lenthenid or actinide tatwon ko sarini main sthaan na hona do mukhya dosha ab tak hai
 a few months after Medleaf introduced the periodic table, German scientist Lothar Meyer also independently created the periodic table

 In today's time, malnutrition has become a matter of concern for the international community
 yahaan tak kii vishwa bank ne isaki tulana blake deth naamak mahamari se kii he
 Which swallowed up a large part of Europe's population in the 18th century
 kuposhan ko kyon itnaa mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa hai? vishwa bank jaisi santhaayen kyon iske prati itani chintit he? saamaanya rup main kuposhan ko chikitsiya maamla mana jaataa he or hamamen se adhiktar sochate hai ki yah chikitsa kaa vishay he
 In fact, malnutrition is the result of many socio-political causes
 jab bhukh or garibi rajnatik ageda kii praathamikta nahin hoti to badi taadaad main kuposhan sataha par ubharta he
 Take the example of India where malnutrition is higher than its neighbors, more poor and less developed neighbors like Bangladesh and Nepal
 bangladesh main shishu mrityudar 48 prati hajaar he jabaki isaki tulana main bharat main yah 67 prati hajaar he
 It is even higher than the sub-saharan African countries
 bharat main kuposhan kaa dar lagbhag 55 pratishat he jabaki up sahaareey africa main yah 27 pratishat ke aasapaas he
 Mortality per thousand in children under 5: comparative table bangladesh 77 brazil 36 china 09 mishra 41 bharat 93 indonesia 45 mexicon 29 nigeria 183 pakistan 109 jin kshetron main atyamdhik alpai poshan he vahaan kuposhit mahilayen yaa kishori balikayen un bacchond ko janman detii hai jo paidaa hote hi vriddhibaadhit yaa patale hote hai
 In this way, undernutrition is transferred to a generation as a dangerous inheritance
 ye bached aane vaale varshon me vruddhi kii bharpai nahin kar pate
 They soon suffer from the prospect of becoming ill, entering school late, not learning, and growing up to become less productive adults
 is prakaar kuposhan ek bhayankar ‘tim bam’ he
 What is malnutrition yah ek es chakra he jiske changul main bachche apni maa ke garbh main hi funs jate hai
 The destiny of his life is decided even before he is born in the world
 yah niyati likhi jaati he garibi or bhukhmaree kii syaahi se
 Its color is deeply depressed and the rays of hope do not flourish in life when the situation is severe
 kuposhan ke myne hote hai aayu or sharir ke anuroop paryaapt shaareerik vikaas na hona, ek str ke baad yah maansik vikaas kii prakriya ko bhi avarudhd karne lagata he
 The problem of malnutrition is born to very young children, especially from birth to 5 years of age, due to lack of adequate nutritious food through food
 iske parinaam swaroop bacchon main rog pratirohak kshamta kaa haas hota he or choti-choti bimaariyaan unki mrityu kaa kaaran ban jaati hai
 Malnutrition is actually a direct result of household food insecurity
 saamaanya rup main khaadya suraksha kaa arth he sab tak khaadya kii pahunch, har samay khaadya kii pahunch or sakriy or swasthy jivan ke liye paryaapt khaadya
 Families drown in food insecurity when one or all of these components are reduced
 khaadya suraksha sarkaar kii nitiyon or praathamiktaaon par nirbhar karti he
 Take the example of India where the government sits on a heap of food grains
 par upyukt nitiyon ke abhaav main yah jarurat mandon tak nahin pahunch paata he
 Grain rot in the absence of storage, is destroyed by mice or immersed in the oceans, but a large part of the population sleeps hungry
 kuposhan bacchon ko sabase adhik prabhavit karata hai
 It begins before or even after birth and increases rapidly over a period of 6 months to 3 years
 iske parinaam swaroop vrudhdi baadhita, mrityu, kam dakshata or 15 point tak aikyuu kaa nuksaan hota he
 The most terrible result is the economic loss caused by it
 kuposhan ke kaaran maanav utpaadakta 10-15 pratishat tak kam ho jaati he jo sakal gharelu utpaada ko 5-10 pratishat tak kam kar saktaa he
 a large number of children leave school due to malnutrition
 kuposhit bachche ghati hui sikhane kii kshamta ke kaaran khud ko skool main roak nahin pate
 Out of school, they become victims of social neglect and reduced earning capacity and life-long exploitation
 is kaaran badi sankhya main bachein bal shramik yaa bal vaishyavriti ke liye majaboor ho jate hai
 As they grow older, they join a long line of unskilled laborers which becomes a huge burden on the national economy
 kuposhan janm yaa usase bhi pehle shuru hota he or 6 maah se 3 varsh kii avadhi main tivrata se badhata he
 Mother's milk is not enough for a child from 6 months to 3 years old
 baccha khud kha paane yaa maang paane main asamarth hota he
 He needs soft food again and again which only an adult can feed him
 maataaon ko ajeevika kamaane ke saath-saath or bhi kai gharelu kaam karne padate hai jaise-pakaana, pani laana, safai karnaa aadi
 They do not have enough energy or time to feed the child again and again
 parivaar main bhi anya vayask ise sirf mo kii jimmedaari samajhate hai
 a malnourished child in childhood is much less likely to improve later
 madhyanh bhojan, chaatravrutti, bal shramikon ke liye vishesh skool aadi sahaayak to he kintu pehle 6 varshon ke nuksaan kii bharpai nahin kar sakate
 Malnutrition is mainly seen in 6 forms, respectively - 1
 Low birth weight, 2
 Stunted growth in childhood, 3
 Low blood pressure, 4
 Vitamin a deficiency, 5
 Iodine deficiency related diseases, 6
 Obesity 
 bacchon main kuposhan mukhyat: do prakaar kaa hota he : Indications for drought malnutrition with malnutrition bachche kii umr env oonchai ke anuroop uskaa vajan kam hona
 His arms and legs are thin and weak and stomach is increased
 bachche ko baar-baar sankraman hona or biimaar hona
 Malnutrition and Health Related 500 lakh se zyada aise parivaar hai jo ati garib kii shrenee main aate hai
 This means that half of the population is unable to get bread for two times
 yah sidhd ho chukaa he ki paryaapt bhojan nahin milane par sharir kii rogon se ladane kii kshamta kam ho jaati he or vah sheeghra hi bimariyon kii chapet main aa jaataa he
 Being less than two and a half kilograms at birth increases the chances of the child dying at a very young age
 jabaki jahaan kuposhan zyada hota he vahaan khasra se hone vaali mauton kii dar saamaanya se chaar sau guna zyada hoti he
 a study conducted by the National Institute of Nutrition 3 years ago shows that Madhya Pradesh is the most malnourished state in India and the immunity of children has been greatly reduced
 kuposhit bacchon par dast kaa prakope saamaanya se 4 guna adhik hota he
 Maternal deaths in anemia victims are five times higher than those in healthy women
 adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki kul marijon main se kareeb teen-chauthai kii rugnataa kaa kaaran kuposhan yaa usase judi anya dikkatein ho sakati hai
 Malnutrition in children triggers a vicious cycle

 They go home with prasad cooked till late afternoon
 While men are not allowed in the area, they help in providing my support for women coming from outside and departing and organizing free drinks by organizing transport
 Trivandrum city, police and civil authorities have been able to successfully manage the festival, but it is quintessentially a women's festival

 " Le Corbusier began experimenting with furniture design in 1928 when he invited architect Charlotte Perrians to his studio

 In 1928, Le Corbusier and Periane began to implement the instructions in Le Corbusier's 1925 book "la Decorreti dojoordhui"
 is pustak main teen prakaar ke furniture varnit te - "prakaar-zaruri", "prakaar-furniture" or "maanviya-ang"
 He defined human-body objects as "our hands and feet and used for human activities
" prakaar-zaruri, prakaar-kaary, atah prakaar-vastu or prakaar-furniture
 The human-body object is an obedient servant

 Technical historian and architect Louis Mumford says in the city of tomorrow, nav nagarwaad andolan ke sadsy james howard kunstlar, ne lee corboojier kii nagar aayojan yojana ko vinaashkari va vyayshil bataaya he: Le Corbusier was the leading architect of early high modernity, whose 1925 plan was Voisin to destroy the entire Marai district of Paris on the right bank, creating similar skyscrapers between the wide streets
 yah paris kii kismat thi ki jab bhi agle chalis saal main ve is yojana ko le ke gaye, nagar adhikari unpar hanse hi - or lee corbuziye swa-prachaari to the hi
 But unfortunately, the Plan Voisin Plan was implemented by two US planners after World War II, and this led to the infamous Chicago Green Residential Project in Chicago, and similar twenties and antiquities

 His most effective adversary has been Jane Jacobs, who has strongly criticized Le Corbusier's civic creation theories in the death or birth of great intellectual cities
 lee corbuziye nagar niyojan main bahut adhik prabhavi the or "congress international darkitekchar modarn" ke sansthaapak sadsy the
 Le Corbusier was one of the first to understand the possibility of change in human settlements due to automobiles
 bhavishya ke nagar ko lee corbuziye ne bade apartment imaarat, jo ki park jaisi chiz se ghira hoga or pilotiyon par tikaa hoga, aisa sochaa
 Le Corbusier's principles were adopted by the makers of public housing in Western Europe and the United States

 Le Corbusier also gave rhythm to the idea that a place is a group of destinations in which humans move almost continuously
 atah ve automobile ko ek vaahak ke taur par jaays tehra paae or shahari sthano main frive ko mahatv de paae
 His philosophy was found to be useful to the interests of urban developers in the post-world War II era of the United States, as it allowed them to destroy traditional urban spaces and provide high-density commercial and residential urban areas with high density of architecture and intellectuals
 Succeeded in advocating for support

 This movement had no place in the planning of Le Corbusier to link the urban villages isolated from the lower middle class and the working class to other areas, that is, the suburban and rural areas to the urban commercial centers
 aisa isliye tha kyonki niyojan ke anusaar sadaken kamgir va nimna madhyam vargeey virgon ke rihayishi ilaakon ke upar se, neeche se yaa bagal se nikalati thim
 Such projects and areas had no road exit and no access to roads, as people in the Cumbini Green Home Project were cut off from opportunities to get jobs and provide service because it all took Corbuzie Were limited to traffic end-points
 jaise jaise naukariyaan in sadakon ke ant main aane vaale upnagareey anton par pahonchte gaye, nagareey gramvaasiyon ne yah paaya ki unke samudaay in badi sadakon se katate gaye; na hi inke paas saarvajanik yatayaat kii suvidha thi jisase ki ve kifaayat se upnagareey kendron main naukariyaan kar pate
 After a long time, suburban centers found that a shortage of workers was a major problem, so they began to run city-to-city bus services so that all those working people could reach the suburbs without earning so much that people would get into cars

 But in the 1950s, the first doubts began to arise, particularly in essays by his own disciples, such as James Stirling and Colin Rowe, who called their city views dangerous
 baad ke aalochakon ne unke vaastushilp main takneekee khamiyaan bhi nikaalin
 Brian Brace Taylor wrote in his book "arme du Salu" about Lee Corbusier's gimmickry, which led to his commission being made
