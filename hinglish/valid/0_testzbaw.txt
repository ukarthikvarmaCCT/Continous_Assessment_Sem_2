 Initially, the army of the former Jammu and Kashmir princely state was not ready for the initial attacks of tribal fighters of Azad Kashmir, it was deployed only in small numbers to guard the border, so their defense system collapsed immediately in front of the attack and some of their The troops met the enemies
 aaazaad kashmir ke kabeelai ladaake shuruwati aasaan safaltaaon ke baad lutpaat main vyast hry gayi or unhone aage bad aasaani se kabje main aa sakane vaale naye ilaako par hamalaa karne main der kar di or maharaja kae bharat main vilay main sahamati dete hi bhartiya sena ko vimaano kii madad se sainik pahuchane kaa mauka de diya

 yah bhaag is prakaar se hai
 The main objective of the initial attack was to take control of the Kashmir Valley and its major city Srinagar
 jammu or kashmir riyasat kii greeshmakaleen rajdhani srinagar or sheetakaaleen rajdhani jammu thi
 The princely forces stationed at Muzaffarabad and Domel were immediately defeated by a Pakistani army called Azad Kashmir Army and the road to Srinagar was opened

 In Poonch valley, the princely armies retreated and concentrated in the cities, and after several months they were freed from captive Indian Army encirclement
 jammu or kashmir riyasat ke bharat se vilay ke baad bharat ne vimaan ke dwaara sainik or upkaran srinagar pahunchaaye
 Upon reaching there, he strengthened the princely army and built a security cordon around Srinagar and defeated the Azad Kashmir Army
 is suraksha ghere main bhartiya sena ke bakhtarband vahno ke dwaara virodhiyo ko peeche se gherna bhi shaamil tha
 After defeating the retreating Pakistani army from Baramulla and Uri, both these cities were liberated, although the encirclement of the cities continued by the Pakistani army in the Poonch Valley
 gilgit main aaazaad kashmir kii kabeelai sena main gilgit rajya ke ardh sainik bal shaamil ho gayi or chitral ke mehtar jagirdaar kii sena bhi apane jagirdaar ke pakistan main vilay kii ghoshnaa ke baad usame shaamil ho gayi The Indian Army ceased to chase Azad Kashmir's army after the capture of Uri and Baramulla and sent an aid force in an attempt to break the encirclement of Poonch in the south direction
 haalanki sahaayta tukdi poonch pahuch gayi par vah gheraabandi nahin tod paayi or vah bhi funs gayi
 a second support unit reached Kotli but had to retreat leaving the barricade of Apna Kotli, in the meantime, Mirpur was captured by the army of Azad Kashmir
 pakistan / aaazaad kashmir kii sena ne jhanger par kabja kar liya tatpashchaat usne naushera par nakaam hamalaa kiya
 Other contingents of Pakistan / Azad Kashmir army continued unsuccessful attacks on Uri
 duusari ore bharat ne ek chote se akraman se chhmb par kabja bana liya
 By this time, additional military forces were available with the Indian Army, in which situation on the Line of Control began to stabilize
 bhartiya sena balon ne jhanger or rajori par pratiakraman kar ke unhe kabje main le liya
 The Azad Kashmir Army in the Kashmir Valley continued to attack the security apparatus of Uri
 aaazaad kashmir sena ne uttar main scardu kii gheraa bandi kar di
 Despite numerous counter-offensives by the army of Azad Kashmir, the Indians kept control of Jhanger, although now the army of Azad Kashmir was getting more and more help from regular Pakistani soldiers

 The army of Azad Kashmir was getting a good boost in the high Himalayan regions
 unhone tukadiyo kii ghuspaith kar ke kargil par gheraabandi kar di tathaa scardu kii madad ke liye ja rahe bhartiya sainya daston ko haraa diya
 The Indian Army Ballo continued the attack in the Kashmir valley and proceeded northward and captured Keran and Gurais
 unhone tidhwal par kiye gayi ek pratiakarman ko waapas khaded diya
 The Indian contingent at Poonch in the Poonch Valley broke the siege and joined it briefly for the outside world

 In August, Chitral's army attacked Skardu under the leadership of mata-ul-mulk and captured Skardu with the help of artillery
 isse gilgit scout ladakh kii ore aage jane kaa mauka mil gaya
 During this time the Line of Control was being established and the defense of the areas under its control on both sides was more important than attacking
 is dauraan keval ek mahatvapurn abhiyaan chalaaya gaya yah tha abhiyaan dak jo ki bhartiya balo dwaara draas ke kabje ke liye tha is dauraan poonch par gheraabandi jari rahi
 Now the Indian Army was heavily dependent on the Pakistani Army and its supported Azad Kashmir Army on all fields
 poonch ko ek saal lambii gheraabandi se aaazaad kara liya gaya tha or gilgit scout jo ki ab tak acchhee kamyaabi hasil kar rahi thi use use aakhirkaar haraakar uskaa peechha karte hue bhartiya sena ne kargil ko aaazaad kara liya par aage hamalaa karne ke liye bhartiya sena ko rasad kii aapurti kii samasya aa sakati thi atah unhe ruknaa padaa jojila darre ko tanks kii madad se kabje main le liya gaya pakistani sena tanks kii apeksha nahin kar rahi thi or unke turant paanv ukhd gayi
 The use of the tank was possible only due to the experience gained from the Burma War
 is darre par kabje ke baad draas par aasaani se kabja ho gaya
 On reaching this phase of the fight, the Indian Prime Minister made up his mind to take the matter to the United Nations General Assembly and get the matter resolved by him
 31 disambar 1948 ko sanyukt raashtra ke dwaara yuddh viraam kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 a few days before the ceasefire, the Pakistani army broke the road contact between the two by conducting a counter-offensive and seizing the route between Uri and Poonch
 ek lambey molbhav ke baad dono paksh yudhviram par raji ho gayi
 The terms of this ceasefire were adopted by the United Nations on August 13, 1948
 isame pakistan ko apane niyamit or aniyamit sanico ko puri tarah se hataane or bharat ko rajya main kanoon vyavastha lagu karne ke liye aavashyak sainik rakhane kaa prastaav tha
 Upon the fulfillment of this condition a referendum would determine the future and ownership of the state

 These stages were yah ghatnaayen yah bataati hai ki asambhavit jagaho par bakhtarband vahno ke hamale kaa dushman par maansik dabaav padataa he
 It may also happen that the attackers did not use anti-tactic weapons, perhaps they did not leave them behind
 bakhtarband vahno ke prayog kii safalataa ne bharat kii yuddh niti par gahari chhap chodi china ke saath yuddh ke vakt bharatiyo ne badi mehnat se durgam ilaako main bakhtarband vahno kaa prayog kiya kintu us yuddh main bakhtar band vahno ko apekshit safalataa nahin mili
 If we study the changes in the boundary line, then some interesting facts emerge

 The removal of surface or subsurface water in an area in a natural or artificial way is called drainage
 krishi bhoomi ke utpaadan ko sudhaarney yaa pani kii aapurti ke prabandhan ke liye jal nikasi kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 The drains and drainage systems of the ancient Indus civilization, which developed throughout the civilization and continued to be used in cities, are much more advanced than any contemporary urban locations found in the Middle East and in modern-day Pakistan and India
 Some areas were more effective than others
 hadappa or mohanjo-dado ke pramukh shaharon ke sabhi gharon main pani or naaliyon kii suvidhaayen thi
 Wastewater was drained through covered drains, which remained along major lanes
 1881 ke houseold cychlopedia se This process is best done in the spring or summer, when the ground is dry
 kshetra ke prayek hisse main mukhya naalee banaai jaani chahie jahaan purv main cross cat yaa khuli hui naalee kii aavashyaktaa thi; inaki ausat gaharaai chaar feet honi chahie
 This makes them completely safe from the damage caused by mowing by horses or cattle and being so far away from the small drains that they scrub them closely
 har sthiti main, agar sambhav ho sake to, mukhya naaliyon ke liye pipe turf adhik behatar hai
 If there is good hard soil, one row of pipe turf, if sandy, double row of pipe turf should be given
 yadi pipe turf aasaani se na mili, to avbhumi majboot, kathor mitti hone par ek acchhee veg dren adhik behatar vikalp he; lekin avbhumi keval maamuli rup se aisi hai, to thorn dren, jiske neeche jod hon, phir bhi behatar sabit hogi; or yadi avbhumi bahut retili he to pipon ke alaava kisi or vidhi dwaara khet main sataha ke neeche naaliyaan banane kaa prayaas karnaa vyarth he
 It is necessary to mention here that the size of the main drain should be determined according to the length and slope of the flow and the amount of water flowing into it
 yadhyapi mukhya naaliyon kaa bada hona tathaa adhik sankhya main hona sadaiv surakshit he, kintu laagat ke kaaran aisa shaayad hi kabhi ho paata he
 After making the main drains, if the dunes in the east are not less than 15 feet wide, then make small drains in each bed of the field
 But if this is the case, first level the dunes and make drains in the best direction and at the required distance
 If the water rises well into the bottom of the drains, they should be dug three feet deep and by doing so the field will dry out easily, although they were to be dug separately twenty-five to thirty feet; But if the water does not climb well into the bottom of the drains, a depth of two feet for the pipe drain and two and a half feet for the wedge drain is sufficient
 agar khet ko pehle se samtal kiya gaya ho to kisi bhi haalat main ve or khokhli nahin honi chahie
 However, in this instance, because the top of the drain is submerged in the water, the surface water rises mainly, the drains will need to be built close to each other - such as fifteen to twenty feet
 yadi tile pandraa feet se adhik chaude hai, chaahe ve kitne bhi chaude yaa aniyamit hon, naalee kii sarvottam disha ke rup main hameshaa puraani kyaariyon kii lakiron kaa anusaran karen; or jahaan adhik sankhya main tile ikatthe hon, pipe dren ke liye bees se choubees inch tathaa veg dren ke liye choubees se tees inch kii gaharaai paryaapt hogi
 Special care must be taken when connecting the small and main drains, so that water can get an obstructed and good gradient from the main drains
 jab naaliyon kaa kaam khatm ho jaataa he to tilon ko hal dwaara tod diya jaataa he or jahaan purv main ve atyadhik oonche the, ek doosraa prayaas kiya ja saktaa he, kintu yah behatar hoga ki tilon ko bahut adhik samtal naa kiya jaae, taaki ve thoda bahut apni puraani avasthaa main rah saken, jahaan naaliyaan hai vahaan maidan ke nimnatam str par hone ke kaaran sataha kaa pani naaliyon main upar tak ikaitha hota he or uname dub kar swatantra rup se bahata he
 After doing this in the field, make new mounds across small drains, keep them ten feet wide and then plow the field in the same way as run on dry land
 jal nikasi kii uparokt vidhi se yah spasht he ki khet main mukhya naaliyon kii sankhya, choti naaliyon ke bich aapas kii duuri or maidan par tay kii jane vaali duuri ke anusaar kharch main vividhta hogi
 There are many benefits of creating a drain below the surface, which not only saves the cost of making huge amount of water tunnel annually, cross cutting etc
 but also the land can be conveniently plowed and sown in summer and winter, which That is quite impractical without it; Every variety of crops sown through holes such as beans, potatoes, turnips, etc
 can be cultivated successfully and each variety of green and white crops is less likely to spoil in wet and unpleasant climates
 jahaan kahin bhi pani kaa ek jal strot kisi vishesh sthaan se prakat ho to is musiibat se chhutkaaraa paane kaa sabase surakshit va kargar tarika sataha se neeche aise gaddhon kii khudaai karnaa he jisame ki girane vaala pani ikaitha kiya ja sake or jisame bauchhaar yaa jal strot se nikalne vaali pani kii maatra samaa sake
 After determining the amount of water released, noting the required levels, and clearing the estuary or water-logging route, begin the evacuation near that major estuary and work until it reaches the mouth of the shower, Which will probably yield the required item
 lekin agar yah puri tarah se khatm na ho to mukhya naalee main utani sankhya main shakhaaen daalen jitani pani ko bich main rokane ke liye aavashyak hon or is prakaar shaayad hi niraashaa kaa anubhav hoga
 Drains should rarely be less than three feet deep, twenty or twenty four inches full of stone or wood to make them more useful according to the circumstances
 Previously stated material is best, but in many places these things are not found in sufficient quantity; Therefore the latter material should be resorted to, although it is not more functional or durable
 gaddhon ko khudaai ke saath-saath tivrata se bharna atyant mahatvapurn he kyonki, agar lambey samay tak yah khulaa rah jaae to na keval aas paas kii mitti iske andar giregi balki iske kinare bhi kshatigrast yaa aniyamit ho sakate hai jo baad main puri tarah se thik nahin kiye ja sakate

 The drainage pit method is very effective if executed carefully
 jab pani ke strot kii uplabdhta ke bare main paryaapt jaankaree milti he, jo ki ek barame kii sahaayta se boring karke aasaani se pataa kii ja sakati he, us sthaan par ek aise aakaar kaa gaddha banaaen jahaan ek vyakti apni seemaa ke bheetar kaam kar sake
 Dig this pit as deep as the source of the water that comes out; And when this depth is attained, which is revealed by the release of water, fill the pit with large stones and take the water through a strong drain to the nearest pit or mouth from where it is carried to the nearest river
 can go
 aadhunik jal nikasi vyavastha main giotextile filter hote hai jo mitti ke baarik kanon ko khud main se guzarane se rokte tathaa naaliyon ko band hone se bachaate hai
 Geotextiles are synthetic fabrics that have been specifically manufactured for civil and environmental engineering applications
 giotextile is tarah se dizin kiye gaye hai ki ye mitti ke baarik kanon ko roak lete hai kintu pani ko guzarane dete hai
 In a typical drainage system they will be laid in a narrow pit which will then be filled with thick granular material: gravel, sea shell, stone or rocks
 The geotextile is then folded on top of the stone and the pit is then filled with soil
 bhoojal giotextile se risataa he or pathar ke andar se muhane kii ore pravaahit hota he
 In high groundwater conditions, a perforated plastic pipe is placed along the drain base to increase the amount of water transported to the drain
 harith naalee Enzyme-based methods can be a safer alternative than chemical means of cleaning the drain and do not harm the environment
 ye saadhan bacteria yaa anzimon kaa prayog karte hai, jo prakritik rup se jaivik apshisht, jaise naaliyon main aksar funsane vaale baalo yaa apshisht khaadya padaarthon, par palate hai
 These small organisms then digest waste and produce beneficial bacteria and enzymes throughout the septic system
 vastav main, naalee saafe karne vaale anzimon kaa prayog mul rup se septic tinkon or mel ko saafe karne main kiya jaataa tha
 Enzyme-based drain cleaners are better for the environment, as they prevent hazardous chemicals from seeping into the soil and spreading into the water
 
 Alternatively, a plastic drainage system prepared from HDPE / HDPE called smartditch, and often containing filters made of geotextile, coconut fiber, and patchwork, may be considered

 lekin unki vakaalat se unhen or unke muvakkilon ko jitna santosh or maansik shanti mili vah dhan-daulat banane ke aage kuch bhi nahin he
 Hundreds of true stories of his advocacy days testify to his honesty and gentleness

 Once one of his clients sent him twenty-five dollars, Lincoln returned ten dollars from him, saying that fifteen dollars was enough

 sammanneey mahoday, main jaanata hoon ki is duniya main saare log achche or sachche nahin hai
 My son will also have to learn this
 par main chahta hoon ki aap use yah bataaen ki har bure aadmi ke paas bhi acha hriday hota he
 Every selfish leader has the ability to be a good leader
 main chahta hoon ki aap use sikhayen ki har dushman ke andar ek dost banane kii sambhaavna bhi hoti he
 It will take time to learn these things, i know
 par aap use sikhie ki mehnat se kamaaya gaya ek rupaya, sadak par milane vaale paanch rupye ke note se zyada keemtee hota he
 You will tell him not to bring jealousy from others
 saath hi yah bhi ki khulkar hanste hue bhi shaleenta baratna kitna jaruri he
 i hope you will be able to tell him that it is not a good thing to threaten and intimidate others
 yah kaam karne se use dur rahanaa chahie
 You will ask him to read books, but at the same time he will also remind the birds flying in the sky to see the butterflies hovering in the sun, flowers in the green fields
 main samajhataa hoon ki ye baaten uske liye zyada kaam kii hai
 i believe that he must also learn during school days that it is good to fail by copying and passing
 kisi baat par chaahe duusare use galat kahen, par apni sachhee baat par kaayam rahane kaa hunar usamen hona chahie
 Be gentle with kind people and be strict with bad people
 dusron kii sari baaten sunne ke baad usamen se kaam kii chizon kaa chunaav use inhen dinon main siikhnaa hoga
 Do not forget to tell him how sadness can be converted into happiness
 or use yah bhi bataaiega ki jab kabhi rone kaa man kare to rone main shame bilkul naa kare
 i think he should believe in himself and others
 tabhi to vah ek acha insaan ban paaegaa
 These things are big and long
 par aap inamen se jitna bhi use bataa paaen utana uske liye acha hoga

 Recent studies by linguists have confirmed that Fiji Hindi is a specific language based on the Hindi language spoken in India, with special grammar and vocabulary suited to Fiji

 maarg vrikshpaalan ke antargat sadakon ke kinare vriksh lagaana or phir unka anurakshan karnaa aata he
 It is directly related to tree science
 maarg vrikshpaalan ke liye vrikshon kii vruddhi or unki kriya-pranali sambandhi gyaan to anivaaryat: aavashyak he hi, saath hi saath sajaavat ke uddeshy se, dridhtaa ke aadhaar par, pratirodhatmak gunon kii drushti se paudhon ke chunaav or samoohan sambandhi kaushal bhi apekshit hai
 Therefore, in order to fulfill the responsibility of rearing the tree, you should have improvised knowledge of plant-mechanism, soil science, pathology etc
 sajaavat, shiksha sambandhi yaa vaigyanik prayojanon ke liye kashtha utpaadak vriksh bahut pracheen kaal se lagaae jate rahe hai
 There is considerable discussion of plantation and tree care in ancient literature
 vaidic samskruti mulat: ashram samskruti he or bharat garam desh he, at: yahaan adikaal se hi vriksharopan kii mahatta maanya rahi he evam sadakon ke kinare ped lagaana ek punit kaary samajha jaataa rahaa he
 Centuries ago, when the history of roads in the western world begins, it was famous for the splendid trees that gave shade to Indian travelers
 sadakon ke kinare kuan, baawali, yaa sarai kii apeksha vriksharopan kaa mahatv kam na tha
 Trees are planted along the road, usually on both sides, parallel and continuously, in rows, far away from the circle
 bahudhaa ikhari pankti hi donon ore lagaai jaati he, kintu yadi sadak ke kinare bahut chaudee pattee ho to vahaan do panktiyaan bhi lagaai ja sakati hai
 There should be a gap of at least forty feet between the trees, so that the healthy growth of trees is possible and when they are fully grown, the leaves of one do not touch the other
 bargad sareekhe kuch vishaal vrikshon ke liye yah antar or bhi adhik rakhana pad saktaa he
 In each case, there should be such a distance on both sides of the road that if there is a single orbit, then it is ten to twelve feet and if there is a double or two path, then twenty-twenty four feet can remain completely open on the road
 is drushti se sthaneey mitti ke liye upyukt vrikshon kaa chunaav karne ke saath yah bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he ki ped kam ghere vaale hon
 The property on the side of the road also has to be taken care of, as if it is a particularly fertile land, trees should be planted such that their shade does not cause any special damage to the crop
 shahari kshetron main aise ped lagane chahie jo vartmaan, athwa prastaavit, maarg-prakaashan-vyavastha main baadha na den or na vartmaan sanrachanaon ko hi koi haani pahunchaayen
 The first phase of plantation involves digging pits and preparing the saplings
 vrikshon kii sthiti nishchit ho jane par vahaan kam se kam teen foot lambey, teen foot chaude or teen foot gahare gadde khode jate hai or khudi hui kuch mitti se gadde ke chaaron ore ek band jaisaa bana diya jaataa he
 It is called 'thala'
 thala banane kaa kaam varsha ke pehle hi puraa kar liya jaataa he
 The carved soil is mixed with manure of available leaves and cow dung etc
, and then it is filled in the basin in such a way that the pit is almost a little below the ground
 ise varsha main baithne ke liye chhod dete hai
 The plant is prepared in the beds at a convenient place
 yahan prashikshit or anbhavi mali kii dekh rekh main paudhe badhate hai
 The beds should be made in such a place where water can always be found and they can be protected from animals
 kadi dhoop se bhi paudhon ko bachaana aavashyak hota he
 Plants are usually planted in or just after rain, when the pits are wet and are suitable for planting
 thale ke bichon bich lagbhag chah inch chaukor or 12 inch gaharaa gaddha khodakar, usamen swasth or saamaanya badhwaala koi paudha chunakar laga diya jaataa he
 Then water is given in it daily until the plant takes root
 dhire dhire uski kuch yaa sari pattiyaan jhad jaati hai or nai nikalne lagati hai
 If the stalk is green and sprouts are coming out of it, the plant should be considered alive
 is avadhi main vishesh dekhbhaal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Circles of mud, brick or wood are made around the plains, so that the animals do not graze the plants
 paudhe kii or mitti kii kism ke anusaar lagbhag teen se paanch varsh tak sinchai or niraai gudayi kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 When grown, numbers are placed on the plants
 sab pedo kii ek suchi bana lee jaati he, jisamen bhavishya main aavashyaktaanusaar yadi kabhi koi parivartan ho to sanshodhan kiya ja sake
 The most commonly planted trees along the road are mango, tamarind, berries, banyan, peepal, neem, bakayan, ashoka, rosewood, teak, mahua, coconut and dates
 babul sareekhe kantedaar ped lagaana thik nahin hota, kyonki inke sookhe kaante gir gir kar paidal tathaa savariwale, sabhi yatriyon ko ksht dete hai
 Trees are often selected from the point of view of soil
 paudhon main anek prakaar ke rog bhi lag jate hai aisi dasha main sheeghra hi upachaar hona chahie
 Sometimes the lower saws appear in the leaves as small white eggs or as fungi in the twigs
 inhen turant nasht kar dena chahie or paudhon par chooney kaa pani or nila thotha ke halake ghol kaa mishran, athwa tambaakoo kaa pani, chhidak dena chahie
 If not immediately treated, the disease can spread to other plants
 kabhi-kabhi to thaalon me bhari hui mitti yaa khaad main hi keetanu maujuud rahete hai or vahiin se pedo main fail jate hai or kabhi-kabhi nearesth vanaspati se
 An important part of road-treeing is chopping or branching
 yadi paudhe main atyadhik tahaniyaan yaa shakhaayen nikal aati hai, to uski baadh ruuk jaati he
 The spread of branches makes it difficult for the smooth movement of vehicles over the road
 isaliye kisi tej chaaku, kanchi yaa kulhadi se aisi sabhi anaavashyak shakhaayen or tahaniyaan kaat deni chahie jo besangi lagati hon, yaa yatayaat main baadhak hoti hon
 Add thick, sharp ax or saws should be cut in such a way that the skin does not come off and the tree is not damaged
 patale or jhuke hue tanevaale paudhe yadi badale na ja saken, to unhen thale main ek lakdi gaadkar usase band dena chahie, taaki ve dhire-dhire sidhe ho jaayan
 If all this work is done in a systematic manner, carefully, under the supervision of an experienced person, in suitable weather, then a very attractive path is prepared
 vriksharopan or vrikshon ke paalan kii laagat-sthaneey paristhitiyon ke anusaar bhinn bhinn hoti he
 It depends to a great extent on wage rates, water availability, soil type and tree species
 maarg vrikshpaalan par hua vyay yadi lakdi or falon ke rup main vasuul na ho, to yah vyarth nahin jaataa
 From the point of view of the comfort of the passengers, it is beneficial
 itnaa hi nahin, upyukt jati ke vriksh chunakar unhen sundar dhang se lagane se nirjan maarg bhi sundarataa se bhar jaataa he or manohari vithi kaa rup grahan kar letaa he
 Therefore, road engineers should pay as much attention in this direction as on road construction and repair

 Secularism, secularism or secularism is the principle of separation of religious institutions and religious mandates from governmental institutions and government mandated to represent the state
 yah ek aadhunik rajnatik evam samvidhani siddhanth he
 There are basically two proposals for secularism: 1) Religion should not interfere in the operation and policy-making of the state
 2) sabhi dharm ke log kanoon, samvidhan evam sarkari niti ke aage samaan he
 The term secularism was first used by George Jacob Holliak of Birmingham during 1846 to show ways of improving human life through experience
 unke anusaar, “aastikta-naastikta or dharm granthon main uljhe bagaiyr manushya maatr ke shaareerik, maansik, charitrik, bauddhik swabhaav ko ucchtam sambhavit bindu tak viksit karne ke liye pratipaadit gyaan or seva hi dharmanirpekshata he”
 In secular countries, there are various constitutional benefits to maintain secularism

 saanchaa:library resources box Template: Theology ]] Template: Relpolnav avastai ek purvi irani bhashaa he jiskaa gyaan aadhunik yug main keval parsi dharm ke granthon, yani avastaa, ke dwaara pahunch paaya he
 Historians believe that this language or its dialects were spoken in the period of 1500–1100 BCE in the Yaz culture located in the Bactria and Margu regions of Central Asia
 kyonki yah ek dharmik bhashaa ban gai, isliye is bhashaa ke saadhaaran jivan se lupt hone ke pashchaat bhi iskaa prayog nae granthon ko likhane ke liye hota rahaa
 Only two Iranian languages written in the era of 1500 BC have been written 
 ek "pracheen avastai" he jo uttarpurv main boli jaati thi or ek "pracheen farsi" he jo dakshin-pashchim main boli jaati thi
 Among Iranian languages, it is a major division of Eastern Iranian languages and Western Iranian languages
 armbh main keval ek "aadim hind-irani bhashaa" thi - isi se hind-irani bhashaa parivaar kii sabhi bhashaayen janmi hai, jinamein sanskrit, hindi, kashmiri, farsi, pashto sabhi shaamil hai
 Ancient Avastai is the language of the era when Eastern Iranian languages and Vedic Sanskrit were very similar
 pashchimi irani bhashaaon main kuch badlaav aa rahe the jis se vah vaidic sanskrit se thodi bhinn ho chuki thi
 It can be said that the ancient avastai was between these two - it is very similar to Vedic Sanskrit and it is also similar to ancient Persian
 avastai bhashaa main rachanaayen kam hai isliye avastai shabd-vyakaran samajhane ke liye bhashavaigyanik vaidic sanskrit kaa pehle adhyayan kar uski sahaayta lete hai kyonki avastai or vaidic sanskrit main is kshetra main nikat kaa sambandh he
 In the 19th century, Western scholars had a new look at both Avastai and Vedic Sanskrit, and the fact of their deep relationship was soon revealed to them
 unhone dekha ke avastai farsi or vaidic sanskrit ke shabdon main kuch saral niyamon ke saath ek se dusre ko anuvaadit kiya ja saktaa tha or vyakaran kii drushti se yah donon bahut nazadik the
 In his book "comparison of Avastai Grammar with Sanskrit and the Avastai alphabet and its transliteration" published in 1892, the linguist and scholar Abraham Jackson, for example, directly translated an Avatai's religious verse into Vedic Sanskrit - avastai kii apni "pahalavi" lipi thi or uskaa istemaal ab parsi dharmik prayogon ko chhodkar lupt ho chukaa he
 It is written from right to left like Persian and ancient Indian script Kharoshthi
 isamen 13 mul akshar the jinke avastai main 53 bhinn rup prayog hote the
 These characters were based on the Aramai script, from which all modern scripts of India have also originated
