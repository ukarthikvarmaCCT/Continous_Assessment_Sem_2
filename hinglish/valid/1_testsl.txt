 The Green Revolution started in India from 1966-67
 harith kranti prarambh karne kaa shrey nobel puraskaar vijeta professor naraman borlog ko jaataa hai
 Green revolution is intended to increase crop production in irrigated and non-irrigated agricultural areas of the country by using high yielding hybrids and dwarf seeds

69 lakh quintal aadhaar bijon kaa utpaadan hua tathaa 190 lakh pramanit beej vitarit kiye gayi
 Development of irrigation facilities nai vikaas vidhi ke antargat desh main sinchai suvidhaon kaa teji ke saath vistaar kiya gaya he
 The total irrigation potential in the country was 223 lakh hectares in 1951, which increased to 1,073 lakh hectares in 2008-2009
 desh main varsh 1951 main kul sanchit kshetra 210 lakh hectares tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 673 lakh hectares ho gaya

 In other words, achieving maximum output from a unit area of land without destroying the fertility power of the land is called multi-crop program
 1966-1967 main 36 lakh hectares bhoomi main bahufasali kaarykram lagu kiya gaya
 At present, this program is applicable on 71 percent of the total accumulated land of India
 aadhunik krishi yantron kaa prayog Modern agricultural equipment, such as tractors, threshers, harvesters, bulldozers and diesel and electric pumpsets, have contributed significantly to the new agricultural development method and green revolution

 krishi shiksha evam prashikshan kii gunvattta banaaye rakhane ke liye vibhinn sansthaaon ke computarikaran or internet kii suvidha pradaan kii gai he
 Improvement in agricultural production, increase in production and productivity harith kranti athwa bhartiya krishi main lagu kii gai nai vikaas vidhi kaa sabase bada laabh yah hua ki desh main fasalon ke kshetrafal main vruddhi, krishi utpaadan tathaa utpaadakta main vruddhi ho gai
 There was an unprecedented increase in production of wheat, millet, paddy, maize and sorghum in particular
 jiske parinaam swaroop khadyannon main bharat aatmanirbhar-sa ho gaya
 The total production of food grains in the country in 1951-1952 was 5
09 million tonnes, which increased to 238 million tonnes respectively in 2008-2009
 isi tarah prati hectares utpaadakta main bhi paryaapt sudhaar hua he
 Production of food grains was 522 kg / ha in 1950–1951, which increased to 1,893 kg / ha in 2008–2009
 haan, bharat main khadyann utpaadanon main kuch ucchavachan bhi hua he, jo bure mausam aadi ke kaaran rahaa jo yah siddh karata he ki desh main krishi utpaadan abhi bhi mausam par nirbhar karata he
 Changes in the traditional form of agriculture harith kranti ke falswaroop kheti ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan hua he or kheti vyavsaayik drushti se kii jane lagi he
 Whereas earlier it was used only to fill the stomach
 desh main ganna, kapaas, patson tathaa tilhanon ke utpaadan main vruddhi hui he
 Cotton production was 5
6 million bales in 1960–1961, which increased to 27 million bales in 2008–2009
 isi tarah tilhanon kaa utpaadan 1960-1961 main 7 million ton tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 28
2 million ton ho gaya
 Similarly, production of commercial crops like jute, sugarcane, potato and groundnut has also increased
 vartmaan samay main desh main baagbani fasalon, falon, subjiyon tathaa phulon kii kheti ko bhi badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 Increase in agricultural savings unnatsheel bijon, rasinic khaadon, uttam sinchai tathaa mashiinon ke prayog se utpaadan badha he
 Due to which farmers have increased significantly in the amount of savings
 jisko desh ke vikaas ke kaam main laayaa ja sakaa he
 Strengthening forward and backward relationships naveen praudyogiki tathaa krishi ke aadhunikaran ne krishi tathaa udyog ke paraspar sambandh ko or bhi majboot bana diya he
 Traditionally, though the forward link between agriculture and industry was already strong, because many inputs are made available to industries by the agricultural sector
 parantu in donon main pratigaami sambandh bahut hi kamazor tha, kyonki udyog nirmit vastuon kaa krishi main bahut hi kam upyog hota tha
 But as a result of modernization of agriculture, there has been a huge increase in the demand for industrial manufactured inputs in agriculture, such as agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, etc
, due to which the retrograde relationship of agriculture has also been strengthened
 anya shabdon main krishi evam audyogic kshetra ke sambandhon main adhik majbootee ai he
 It is thus clear that there has been a substantial improvement in agricultural inputs and production in the country as a result of the Green Revolution
 iske falswaroop krishak, sarkaar tathaa janata sabhi main yah vishwaas jaagrath ho gaya he ki bharat krishi padaarthon ke utpaadan ke kshetra main aatmanirbhar hi nahin ho saktaa, balki niryaat bhi kar saktaa he
 Analysis desh main yojana kaal main krishi ke kshetra main paryaapt vikaas hua he
 The total agricultural area has increased, the nature of the crop has changed, the irrigated area has increased, the use of chemical fertilizers has increased and modern agricultural machines have started being used
 in sab baton ke hote huye bhi abhi tak desh main krishi kaa vikaas uchit str tak nahin pahunch paaya he, kyonki yahan prati hectares krishi utpaadan anya viksit deshon kii tulana main kam he
 It now studies importing many agricultural products
 kyonki unka utpaadan maang kii tulana main kam he
 a large part of the agricultural sector is still unirrigated
 krishi main yantrikaran kaa str abhi bhi kam he, jisase utpaadan laagat adhik aati he
 Farmers do not get sufficient departmental facilities, which hinders agricultural development
 atah is baat kii aavashyaktaa he ki krishi main takniki evam sansthagat sudhaaron ko adhik kargar dhang se lagu kar krishi kshetra kaa or adhik vikaas kiya jaye
 Expansion of green revolution kendriya bajet 2010-2011 main krishi kshetra ke vikaas ke liye banaai gayi kaary yojana ke pehle ghatak main gram sabhaaon tathaa kisaan pariwaron ke sakriy sahyog se desh ke purvi kshetra bihar, chhattisgarh, purvi uttar pradesh, pashchim bengal tathaa urisa main harith kranti ke vistaar ke liye 400 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Drawbacks and problems desh main harith kranti ke falswaroop kuch fasalon ke utpaadan main paryaapt vruddhi hui he, khadyanno ke aayaat main kami ai he, krishi ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan aayaa he, phir bhi is kaarykram main kuch kamiyaan parilakshith hoti hai
 The major shortcomings and problems of the Green Revolution can be presented as follows: prabhaav - harith kranti kaa prabhaav kuch vishesh fasalon tak hi simit rahaa, jaise- gehun, jowar, bajra
 There has been no impact on other crops
 yahan tak ki chaaval bhi isse bahut hi kam prabhavit hua he
 Business crops are also unaffected by this
 poonjivadi krishi ko badhaava - adhik upjau kism ke beej ek puunji-gahan kaarykram hai, jisamen urvarkon, sinchai, krishi yantron aadi aagton par baari maatra main nivesh karnaa padataa he
 Investing heavily is beyond the capacity of small and medium-sized farmers
 is tarah, harith kranti se laabh unheen kisaanon ko ho rahaa he, jinke paas nijee pumping set, tractor, nalakup tathaa anya krishi yantra hai
 This facility is available only to big farmers of the country
 saamaanya kisaan in suvidhaon se vanchit hai
 The need for institutional reforms is not emphasized - the need for institutional reforms has been completely ignored in the new development method
 sansthagat parivartano ke antargat sabase mahatvapurn ghatak bhu-dhaaran kii vyavastha he
 It is only with this technology that maximum output can be achieved by technological changes
 desh main bhoomi sudhaar kaarykram safal nahin rahe hai tathaa lakhon krishakon ko aaj bhi bhu-dhaaran kii nischitata nahin pradaan kii ja saki he
 The problem of labor displacement - Due to agricultural mechanization used under the Green Revolution, labor displacement has got a boost
 gramin jansankhya kaa rojgaar kii talash main shaharon kii ore palaayan karne kaa yah bhi ek kaaran he
 Increasing income inequality - Technological changes in agriculture have the opposite effect on income distribution in rural areas

 15 navambar 1949 ko godse ko ambala jail main phaansi de di gai
 Nathuram Godse was born on 19 May 1910 in the Chittapavan Marathi family at the Baramati salt place near Pune in the state of Maharashtra, India
 inke pita vinayak vamanrav godse post aphis main kaam karte the or mata lakshmi godse ek gruhani thim
 The birth name of Nathuram was Ramachandra
 inke janm se pehle inke mata-pita kii santaanon main teen putron kii alpakaal main hi mrityu ho gayi thi keval ek putree hi jivit bachi thi
 Therefore, his parents, considering the curse on the life of male children, had prayed to God that if there is a son now, he will be raised like a girl
 isi manyata ke kaaran balak ramchandra kii naak bachapan main hi chhidava diya gaya or manyata anusaar ramchandra ko baalkaal main apane naak main ek nath
 Because of this, the boy Ramchandra was called as Nathuram
 brahman parivaar main janm hone ke kaaran nathuram kaa bachapan se hi dharmik kaaryon main gahari ruchi thi
 According to his younger brother Gopal Godse, he used to speak such strange verses in his mind during his childhood which he had never read
 dhyanavastha main ye apane parivaar waalon or unki kuladevi ke madhya ek sutara kaa kaary kiya karte the parantu yah sab 16 varsh tak kii aayu tak aate-aate swat: samaapt ho gaya

 1940 main hyderabad ke tatkaaleen shaasha nizaam ne uske rajya main rahane vaale hinduon par balaat jajia kar lagane kaa nirnay liya jiskaa hindu mahasabha ne virodh karne kaa nirnay liya
 The first batch of Hindu Mahasabha activists went to Hyderabad under the leadership of Nathuram Godse on the orders of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the then president of the Hindu Mahasabha
 hyderabad ke nizaam ne in sabhi ko bandi bana liya or karawas main kathor dand diye parantu baad main harkar usne apana nirnay waapas le liya
 The partition of India in 1947 and the communal violence at the time of partition gave Nathuram a great boost
 tatkaaleen paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue beesvin sadi kii us sabase bady traasadee ke liye mohandas karamchand gandhi hi sarvaadhik uttaradaayi samaj main aaye
 According to the decision taken at the time of partition, India was to give 75 crores rupees to Pakistan, out of which 20 crores had been given
 usee samay pakistan ne bharat ke kashmir praant par akraman kar diya jiske kaaran bharat ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru or gruhamantri sardaar ballab bhai patel ke netritv main bharat sarkaar ne pakistan ko 55 karod rupee na dene kaa nirnay kiya, parantu bharat sarkaar ke is nirnay ke viruddh gandhi anshan par baith gayi
 Upset about this decision of Gandhi, Nathuram Godse and some of his colleagues decided to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi

 According to the plan, Gandhi was to be killed at the time of the chaos caused by the bombings, but at that time his pistol was jammed and he could not move at all
 is kaaran nathuram godse or unke baaki saathi vahaan se bhagkar pune waapas chale gayi jabaki madanlaal paahwa ko bheed ne pakad kar police ke hawaale kar diya
 Nathuram Godse returned from Pune to Delhi to kill Gandhi and there were Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan who were visiting refugee camps
 usee dauraan unako ek sharnaarthi mila, jisase unhone ek italvi company kii bairata pistaul kharidi
 Nathuram Godse also confessed to the crime of possessing illegal scriptures
 usee sharnaarthi shivi main unhone apana ek chaaya-chitra khinchvaaya or us chitra ko do patron ke saath apane sahyogi narayan apte ko pune bhej diya
 On 30 January 1948, Nathuram Godse reached Birla Bhavan in Delhi 40 minutes before the time of prayer meeting
 jaise hi gandhi prarthana-sabha ke liye parisar main daakhil hue, nathuram ne pehle unhen haath jodakar pranaam kiya uske baad bina koi bilamb kiye apni pistaul se teen goliyaan maar kar gandhi kaa ant kar diya
 Godse made no attempt to escape after that
 nathuram godse par mohandas karamchand gandhi kii hatya ke liye abhiyog punjab ucch nyaayalay main chalaaya gaya tha

 kintu itihaaskaaron ke matanusaar satta main baithe log bhi gandhi ji kii hatya ke liye utane hi jimmevaar the jitne ki nathuram godse yaa unke anya saathi
 If considered from this point of view, then Madanlal Pahwa should have been rewarded for this and not punished because he had bombed the same place ten days before the murder case and alerted the government that Gandhi, who was very revered All people used to say Bapu, no longer safe Anyone can go to a prayer meeting and shoot them
 muqadame ke liye nathuram ko sarvapratham punjab ucch nyaayalay main pesh kiya gaya
 He was awarded the death penalty on 8 November 1949 after a trial lasting over a year

 The family he was born into was a Brahmin family
 unka janm sthaan bhi ek pavitra tirthasthal ke rup main vikhyath rahaa he
 Radhakrishnan's ancestors had previously lived in a village called 'sarvepalli' and in the mid-18th century they had migrated towards the village of Tirutani
 lekin unke purakhe chaahate the ki unke naam ke saath unke janmasthal ke gram kaa bodh bhi sadaiv rahanaa chaiye
 That is why his family started wearing 'sarvapalli' before his name
 dow radhakrishnan ek garib kintu vidwaan brahman kii santaan the
 His father's name was 'sarvepalli Veeraswamy' and mother's name was 'sitamma'
 unke pita rajasav vibhaag main kaam karte the
 He was responsible for the maintenance of a very large family
 veeraswami ke paanch putr tathaa ek putree thi
 Radhakrishnan's place was second among these descendants
 unke pita kaafii kathinaayee ke saath parivaar kaa nirvahan kar rahe the
 Due to this, the child Radhakrishnan did not get any special pleasure in childhood
 radhakrishnan kaa balykaal tirutani evam tirupati jaise dharmik sthalon par hi vyateet hua
 He spent the first eight years in Tirutani
 yadhyapi unke pita puraane vichaaron ke the or unamem dharmik bhavanaayen bhi thim, iske baavjood unhone radhakrishnan ko chrishchiyan mishanri sanstha luthern mishan skool, tirupati main 1896-1900 ke madhya vidyadhyayan ke liye bheja
 Then for the next 4 years he was educated in Vellore
 iske baad unhone madras chrishchiyan college, madras main shiksha praapt kii
 He was brilliant since childhood
 in 12 varshon ke adhyayan kaal main radhakrishnan ne bible ke mahatvapurn ansh bhi yaad kar liye

 Dr
 Radhakrishnan introduced the Indian philosophy to the world through his writings and speeches
 saare vishwa main unke lekhon kii prashansa kii gayi
 At that time, in the Brahmin families of Madras, marriage was completed at an early age and Radhakrishnan was no exception
 1903 main 16 varsh kii aayu main hi unka vivaah dur ke rishte kii bahan 'sivaakamu' ke saath sampann ho gaya
 At that time his wife was only 10 years old
 atah teen varsh baad hi unki patni ne unke saath rahanaa armbh kiya
 Although his wife Sivakamu was not traditionally educated, he had good authority over the Telugu language
 vah angrezi bhashaa bhi likh-pard sakati thim
 In 1908, the Radhakrishnan couple received a daughter as a child
 1908 main hi unhone kala snaatak kii oopaadhi pratham shrenee main praapt kii or darshan shaastra main vishisht yogyata praapt kii
 In 1909, after six years of marriage, he also passed the postgraduate examination in Arts
 inkaa vishay darshan shaastra hi rahaa
 He also continued to teach tuition to children for his personal income during higher studies
 1908 main unhone em0 e0 kii oopaadhi praapt karne ke liye ek shodh lekh bhi likhaa

 isse shastron ke prati unki gyaan-pipaasa badi
 Soon he also studied Vedas and Upanishads deeply
 iske atirikt unhone hindi or sanskrit bhashaa kaa bhi ruchipurvak adhyayan kiya
 While education definitely has an impact on every individual, the quality of an educational institution also leaves an impact
 chrishchiyan sansthaaon dwaara us samay pashchimi jivan mulyon ko vidhyaarthiyon ke bheetar kaaphi gaharaai tak sthapit kiya jaataa tha
 This is the reason that while studying in Christian institutions, Radhakrishnan's life had high qualities
 lekin unamem ek anya parivartan bhi aayaa jo ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon ke kaaran hi tha
 Some people used to view Hindutva ideas and criticize them
 unki aalochana ko dow radhakrishnan ne chunauti kii tarah liya or hindu shastron kaa gaharaa adhyayan karnaa armbh kar diya
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan wanted to know that in which culture ideas really are conscious and in which culture ideas are rooted? Then by natural intuition started to believe strongly that the poor and illiterate people living in remote places of India also knew the ancient truth
 is kaaran radhakrishnan ne tulanaatmak rup se yah jaan liya ki bhartiya aadhyatm kaafii samrudh he or chrishchiyan mishnariyon dwaara hindutv kii aalochanaayen niraadhaar hai
 From this he concluded that Indian culture is based on religion, knowledge and truth which gives the true message of life to the creature
 dow radhakrishnan ne yah bhalee bhanti jaan liya tha ki jivan bahut hi chota he parantu isamen vyaapt khushiyaan anishchit hai
 For this reason, a person should live happily and comfortably
 vastutah mrityu ek atal sachai he, jo amir garib sabhi ko apana grass banaati he tathaa kisi prakaar kaa varg bhed nahin karti
 True knowledge is the only one who can eliminate the ignorance inside you
 sadgipurn santoshavritti kaa jivan amiron ke ahamkaari jivan se behatar he, jinamein asantosh kaa nivas he
 a quiet mind is better than those thunderous applause; Which are heard in parliaments and courts
 vastut: isi kaaran dow radhakrishnan bhartiya samskruti ke naitik mulyon ko samaj paane main safal rahe, kyonki ve mishnariyon dwaara kii gai aalochanaon ke satya ko swayan parakhnaa chaahate the
 That is why criticisms are said to be acts of purification
 sabhi matayen apane bacchon main ucch sanskaar dekhnaa chaahati hai
 For this reason, they teach children how to believe in God, stay away from sin and help those who are in trouble
 dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah bhi janaa ki bhartiya samskruti main sabhi dharmon kaa aadar karnaa sikhaaya gaya he or sabhi dharmon ke liye samta kaa bhav bhi hindu samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan he
 Thus he understood the specific identity of Indian culture and became very close to it
 dow radhakrishnan samooche vishwa ko ek vidhyalay maanate the
 He believed that only through education can the human mind be properly utilized
 at: vishwa ko ek hi ikai maanakar shiksha kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 In his speech at the University of Edinburgh, UK, Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had said - "man should be one
 maanav itihaas kaa sampurna lakshya maanav jati kii mukti tabhi sambhav he jab deshon kii nitiyon kaa aadhaar puure vishwa main shaanti kii sthapana kaa praytn ho
 "dr
 Radhakrishnan used to enchant the students with his wit-filled explanations, joyful expressions and mildly tickling stories
 ucch naitik mulyon ko apane aacharan main utaarne kii prerana vah apane chaatro ko bhi dete the
 Whatever subject he taught, he himself studied it deeply
 darshan jaise gambheer vishay ko bhi vah apni style se saral, rochak or priy bana dete the
 In 1909, at the age of 21, Dr
 Radhakrishnan started teaching philosophy as a junior lecturer in Madras Presidency College
 yah unka param saubhaahgya tha ki unako apni prakruti ke anukool aajeevika praapt hui thi
 Here he not only did teaching work for 7 years but also studied Indian philosophy and Indian religion deeply
 un dinon vyaakhyaata ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki adhyaapan hetu vah shikshan kaa prashikshan bhi praapt kare
 That is why in 1910 Radhakrishnan started taking training in Madras
 is samay inkaa vetan maatr 37 rupee tha
