 kumaar sanu hindi filmon ke ek prasiddh gayak hai
 He started his songs in 1989
 2009 main inhen bharat sarkaar dwaara padam shri bhi mil chukaa he
 Kumar Sanu is a well-known playback singer of Hindi cinema
 kolkata main janme kumaar sanu kaa mul naam kedarnath bhattacharya he
 His father himself was a good singer and musician
 unhone hi kumaar sanu ko gayaki or tabalaa vaadan sikhaaya tha
 Sanu, who considers singer Kishore Kumar his role model, has maintained his own style of singing
 unako pehla brake jagajeet singh ne diya tha
 He introduced her to Kalyanji Anand ji, who sang a song from Kumar Sanu for the 1989 film 'magician'
 ek din main 28 gane record karwaane vaale vah ekmaatr gayak hai
 He has sung fourteen thousand songs
 kumaar sanu kaa aaj ke daur ke sangeet ke bare main kahana he ki 'aaj ke sangeet se melody, sur, taal aadi kahin gum hota ja rahaa he or uski jagah shor le rahaa he
 This is the reason why most of today's songs do not seem memorable
 ' unki chahat hameshaa rahi ki kaash unhone sachin dev burman ke saath koi gaanaa gaaya hota
 He has been active in Bengali films for a long time and less in Hindi films
 san 2009 main unke abhootpurv sangeet yogadan ke liye unhen padmashri se nawaaza gaya or desh ke chauthe sabase sammanit naagarik ke taur par manonith bhi hue

 kadambari sanskrit sahitya kaa mahaan upanyaas he
 Its creator is Vaanabhatt
 yah vishwa kaa pratham upanyaas kahalaane kaa adhikari he
 Its story is probably derived from the story of Sumanas, the king of Baddakha composed by Gunadhya
 yah granth banbhatta ke jeevankaal main puraa nahin ho sakaa
 After his death his son Bhushanbhatt completed it and named the part written by his father as 'purva Bhag' and the part written by himself as 'uttarabhaga'
 jahaan harshcharitam aakhyayika ke liye adarsharup he vahaan gadhykavy kadambari katha ke rup main
 In the words of Baan, this story has transcended the earlier two stories
 albdhvaidagdhyavilasamugdhya dhia nibaddhey-matidwai katha-kadambari
 Probably these stories were the legend of Gunadhya and the legend of Subandhu
 aisa prathit hota he ki baan is kriti ko sampoorn kiye bina hi divangat hue jaisaa ki unke putr ne kaha he: Pulind or Bhushanbhatt completed this story
 kadambari kii katha sankshep main is prakaar he: It has a fictional story which mentions the three births of Chandrapid and Pundarik
 kathanusaar vidisha naresh shudrak ke darbar main ativ sundari chandal kanya vaishampayan naamak tote ko lekar aati he
 This parrot speaks the dialect of man
 raja ke prashnottar main tota bataata he ki uski mata mar chuki he or uske pita ko akhetak ne pakad liya tathaa use jabali muni ke shishy pakad kar ashram main le gayi
 Meanwhile, there is a story of King Chandrapid and his friend Vaishampayan by sage Jabali
 ujjayini main tarapid naam kaa ek raja tha jiskaa shuknas naam kaa ek budhimaan mantri tha
 The king received a son named Chandrapid and the minister's son's name was Vaishampayan
 digvijay ke prasang main chandrapid ek sundar achchhodasarovar par pahunchaa jahaan asamay main divangat premi pundaree kii pratiksha karti hui kampidit kumari mahasweta naam kii ek sundari use mili
 Mahasweta told her friend Kadambari about Chandrapid and took her to Kadambari
 pratham darshan se hi kadambari or chandrapid kaa prem ho gaya
 Then Chandrapid's father called him back and left his hostess named Patralekha near Kadambari and returned to Chandrapid
 patralekha ne bhi kadambari-vishyak soochna ko bhejte hue chandrapid ko prasann rakhaa
 The work of the arrow ends here
 jahaan tak kathanak kaa sambandh he, banbhatta brihatkatha ke rini hai
 The story of Somdev and Kamarndrika, available in the Sanskrit version of Brihatkha composed by Somdev, corresponds to the story of Chandrapid and Kadambari
 parantu shuknas kaa charitra-chithran vaishampayan tathaa mahasweta kii premakatha ityadi baan kii kalpana he
 Baan did not get fame for the invention of the plot, but due to the sublime characterization, diverse descriptions, depiction of human sentiments and the beauty of nature, Baan has gained a high position among poets
 baan sanskrit-gadhy kaa ekcchatra samrat he
 Kadambari of Baan has always been an object of curiosity due to its amazing storytelling, aestheticism and amazing style
 alankrita gadhy kaa charam vaibhav, apni samoochee bhavyabhavy sambhaavnaaon ke saath, uski kadambari main sampoorn sajadhaj ke saath prakat hua he
 But its elaborate, formidable style, vast phraseology, endless narrations covered with infinite adjectives and audacious language have often made it painstaking and scholarly
 saadhaaran pathak ke liye vah asaadhya tathaa agamya he
 He is deprived of his taste
 is rochak kintu kashtsaadhay gadhykavy ko jansulabh banane ke liye iske saral evam sankshipt roopaantaron kii parampara armbh hui
 So far, 12 abstracts embedded in Kadambari's prose and verse have come to light
 sanskrit gadhy ke atul aishwarya, uski sookshm bhangimaaon, hridayahari mriduta tathaa udvegakari karkashta kaa jis kaushal se dohan kiya ja saktaa tha, uskaa rajasi thaat kadambari main vikeern he
 Kadambari has become a rhymeless poem after touching the art of arrow
 subandhu ne gadhy ke jis shastreey pattern kaa pravartan kiya tha, baan ne use grahan to kiya kintu usamen 'kavyochit soundarya' kaa samavesh kar use apurv snigdhata pradaan kii he
 The Sanskrit prose is the most important place in the Sanskrit prose because of the rich mixture of art and craft and emotion
 ras-pravanta, kala-soundarya, vakroktimay abhivyanjana-pranali, sanuprasic samaasaantapadawalee, deepak, upama or swaabhaavokti kii ruchir yojana, jiske bich-bich main shlesh, virodhabhas or parisankhya ko goonth diya gaya he, baan ke gadhy kii nijee visheshta he
 Sanskrit prose has reached the sublime sense of poetry by coming to the arrow
 parantu baan kii rasvanti 'kadambari' main mishrit karkashta se khijhakar webar ne uske gadhy kii tulana bhartiya kantar se kar daali he, jisamen pathik ko apane dhairya or shram kii kulhadi se bheeshan samaas aadi ke jhaad-jhankhaadon ko katkar apana maarg swayan bananaa padataa he
 Even then, he has to face the roar of wildlife present as obsolete words
 webar kaa yah akshep sarvatha niraadhaar nahin he
 Kadambari gives the impression of being an object of intellectual luxury of the Pandits due to its inextricability, concordance, syllogism and long syllables
 vastutah koi vishay, bhav tathaa abhivyanjana-prakaar aisa nahin rahaa, jiskaa baan ne aadyant manthan na kiya ho
 The gentle critic has praised this achievement of the arrow by saying 'banocchishtam Jagatsarvam'
 kadambari kii jatilta tathaa brihadaakaar ke kaaran iske saral evam sankshipt roopaantaron kii parampara kaa sutarapaat hua, jisase saamaanya jan bhi iskaa rasaswadan kar saken
 About 12 of its essays contained in prose-verse are known or available
 kadambari ke uplabdh saaron ko do mukhya virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa hai
 The essence of the first category is those in which Kadambari has been summarized by various authors in the independent, self-language
 abhinandakrit kadambari-kathasaar, mandanpranit kadambaridarpan tathaa dhundirajakrit abhinavkadambari is varg ke pratinidhi hai
 Minor Kakadambarisangraha, Chandrapidcharitha, Chandrapidakatha, Kadambariakthasar, Kadambarisar and Kadambarisangrah are the gendered abbreviations of Kadambari, embedded in the terminology of Baan
 inke atirikt suryanarayan shastri-krit kadambarisar, kadambari kaa gadhybaddh swatantra sankshep hai
 These two-dimensional motifs can be considered representative of the second class
 ujaale unki yaadon ke - yah kaarykram aajkal har ravivaar ko raat main saade nau se das baje tak prasaarit hota he jabaki pehle mangalvaar guruuvar ko isi samay prasaarit hota tha

 is kaarykram kii pariklpana bahut acha he
 Usually in such programs, information is given about those who interact, but this is not the case here
 yahan us kalakaar ke puure karier ke dauraan jin-jin logon ke saath unka saath rahaa un sabhi ke bare main baat hoti he
 Not only this, if there is contribution of that artist in other areas apart from film life, then it is also discussed in detail
 yah kaarykram shaayad kamalesh ji prastut karatin he
 Congratulations to Vividh Bharati for the nature of this program
 mehmaan kalakaar se baatcheet karte he camel ji
 Kamal ji has a huge contribution in the popularity of this program
 vah khud bahut hi kam bolte he par mehmaan se sab kuch ugalva lete he
 Even such things that usually popular artists rarely like to say like - aajkal chal rahi shrinkhalaa main lokapriy kalakaar shashikala ne bataaya ki jab madar terresa ke ashram main kalakatta main wo samaaj seva kar raheen thi tab unhen madar se milane kii bahut ichha thi or jab madar ain to kaise chote bacchon kii tarah wo darvaaze ke baahar se madar ko dekhne lagi thim
 When i heard the conversation at this stage, i felt that it is amazing Kamal ji and what would have been the way, and what is the image of the presenter and Vividh Bharati that an artist keeps his heart open
 sirf ek hi shrinkhalaa jo abhi puri bhi nahin hui jisko sun kar whee shaantaram ke bare main bahut jaankaree mili jise shashikala ne anna sahib kaha
 i remembered the film Teen Batti Char Rasta in which Sasikala, a Marathi daughter-in-law of six daughters-in-law Lalaji was made
 hrishi da yani hrishikesh mukherjee ke bare main bhi baaten hui
 It was told that the way he worked and i remembered Anupama's sobering and playful Sasikala who talks to her friend Sharmila Tagore for a long time on the phone and says no on reply - must be shaking her head
 lata mangeshkar or minakumari ke bare main baaten hui to mujhe yaad aa gai film phool or pathar jisamen vaimp bani shashikala gaati he - Drink with glass or drink from scale or sabase zyada yaad aa aayaa wo antim seen jahaan wo apane khaas vaimpanuma kapade pahan kar dharmendra se milane basti main jaati he or sari basti use dekhne jamaa ho jaati he
 Vividh Bharati has always understood her responsibility and has fulfilled it promptly
 desh kaa ye ekmaatr radio channel he jisane sangeet ko apana dharm mana he or har tarah ke sangeet ko apane kaaryakramon main jagah di he
 Vividh Bharati has also done documentation work
 chunki vividh bharti mulat: filmi manoranjan kii seva he isliye yahaan jaani maani filmi hastiyon kii recordings ko sadaiv praathamikta di jaati he
 Today, Vividh Bharati may not have as many recordings of film personalities and celebrities as there are in the music world
 raaj kupar se lekar shahid kapur tak or naragis se lekar priyanka chopra tak har mahatvapurn filmi hasti kii recording vividh bharti ke sangrahalay main surakshit he
 But when it was felt that a small recording of a film personality did not meet the needs of the listeners, a new program started, called Ujale of his memories
 is kaarykram ke zarie kai filmi hastiyon kii puri jivan yatra par charchaa kii gayi
 It includes music composer Naushad, OP Nayyar, Khayyam, Ravi, Laxmi Pyare pair, Pyar Lal, composer, Kalyanji Anand ji pairing Anand ji, actress Mala Sinha, Waheeda Rehman, Leena Chandavarkar, singer Mahendra Kapoor, director Prakash Mehra There have been long talks with many big personalities
 in kalakaaron kii chah se lekar das ghante balki isse bhi zyada vakphe kii ricodings karke vividh bharti ne itihaas ko sametane kaa mahati kaary kiya he
 And still doing today

 As a result of this trend, sociological investigation and investigation of political problems began
 ye khojein evam jaanch na to purna rup se samajashastreey thim or na hi purnatah raajnneetik
 Hence, such studies came to be known as 'political sociology'
 ek swatantra or swytt anushaasan ke rup main ‘raajnneetik samajashaastra’ kaa udbhav or adhyayan-adhyaapan ek nutan ghatana he
 After the First World War, 'political sociology' gained popularity as a distinct discipline in the writings of scholars and thinkers such as Funge Numa, Simond Numa, Haynes Garth, Horowitz, Genovetus, C
 Wright Mills, Grier Orlins, Rose, Mackenzie, Lipset
 Has lekin aaj bhi yah vishay apni baalyavastha main hi he
 Even there is no consensus about the naming of the subject
 katipay vidwaan ise ‘raajnneetik samajashaastra’ kahkar pukaarte hai jabaki anya vidwaan ise ‘raajnneeti kaa samajashaastra’ kahana pasand karte hai

 N
 Call it 'sociological study of political processes and systems'
 ‘raajnneetik samajashastr’ vastutah samajashaastra or raajnneetishastra ke bich vidyaman sambandhon kii ghanishthata kaa suchak he
 Sociologists and political scientists interpret this topic in their own way
 jahaan samaajawaadee ke liye yah samajashaastra kii ek shakha he, jiskaa sambandh samaaj ke andar yaa madhya main nirdisht shakti ke kaarnon evam parinaamon tathaa un saamaajik or raajnneetik dvandvon se he jo ki satta yaa shakti main parivartan laate hai; raajnneetishastri ke liye yah raajnneetishastra kii shakha he jiskaa sambandh sampoorn samaaj vyavastha ke bajaay raajnneetik upvyavastha ko prabhavit karne vaale antahsambandhon se he
 These interrelations are between the political system and other sub-systems of society
 raajnneetishastri kii ruchi raajnneetik tathyon kii vyakhya karne vaale saamaajik parivartyon tak rahati he jabaki samajashastri samast sambandhi ghatnaon ko dekhtaa he
 Being a new subject, 'political sociology' is somewhat difficult to define
 raajnneetik samajashaastra ke antargat ham saamaajik jivan ke raajnneetik evam saamaajik pahaluon ke bich hone vaali antalakriyaaon kaa vishleshan karte hai; arthath raajnneetik karkon tathaa saamaajik karkon ke parsparik sambandhon tathaa inke ek-duusare par prabhaav evam pratichhedan kaa adhyayan karte hai
 The following definitions of 'political sociology' are made: douse tathaa huge : raajnneetik samajashaastra, samajashaastra kii ek shakha he jiskaa sambandh mukhya rup se raajnneeti or samaaj main antalakriya kaa vishleshan karnaa he
 Genovets: In a broader sense, political sociology deals with the social basis of the power of all institutional aspects of society
 is parampara main raajnneetik samajashaastra starikaran ke pratimaanon tathaa sangathit raajnneeti main iske parinaamon kaa adhyayan karata he
 Lipset: Political sociology can be defined as the study of the interrelationships of social and political systems and social structures and political institutions
 bendix : raajnneeti vigyaan rajya se prarambh hota he or is baat kii jaanch karata he ki yah samaaj ko kaise prabhavit karata he
 Political sociology begins with society and examines how it affects the state
 popino : raajnneetik samajashaastra main vrihat saamaajik sanrachana tathaa samaaj kii raajnneetik sansthaaon ke parsparik sambandhon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Sartori: Political Sociology is an intercultural mix that attempts to relate social and political variables, ie the issues proposed by sociologists, to the issues proposed by political scientists
 yadhyapi raajnneetik samajashaastra raajnneetishastra tathaa samajashaastra ko aapas se jodne vaale pulon main se ek he, phir bhi ise ‘raajnneeti ke samajashaastra’ kaa paryaayavachi nahin samajha janaa chahie
 Lewis Kozar: Political sociology is that branch of sociology that deals with social factors and power distribution in the immediate society
 iskaa sambandh saamaajik or raajnneetik sangharsho se he jo shakti vitaran main parivartan kaa suchak he
 Tom Bottamore: Political sociology is concerned with power in a social context
 yahaan satta kaa arth he ek vyakti yaa saamaajik samooh dwaara kaarywahi karne, nirnay karne va unhen karyanvit karne or mote taur par nirnay karne ke kaarykram ko nirdhaarit karne kii kshamta jo yadi aavashyak ho to anya vyaktiyon or samoohon ke hiton or virodh main bhi prayukt ho sakati he
 Traditionalist scholars of political science associated their study subjects with formal institutions like 'state' and 'government'
 raajnneeti vigyaan main vyavahaaravaadi kranti ke parinamswaroop ‘raajnneeti’ shabd kaa prayog vyaktiyon ke raajnneetik vyavhaar, hit samoohon kii kriyaaon tathaa vibhinn hit samoohon main sangharsh ke samaadhaan ke liye kiya jane laga
 David Easton has called it an action related to the authoritative distribution of values in a society
 sankshep main, raajnneeti ke adhyayan se abhipraay keval rajya or sarkaar kii aupchaarik raajnneetik sansthaaon kaa adhyayan karnaa hi nahin apitu yah ek saamaajik kriya he kyonki sabhi prakaar ke saamaajik sambandhon main raajnneeti paayi jaati he
 In conclusion, the approach of political sociology is different from both sociology and political science, due to giving equal importance to social and political factors and hence it is a separate social science

 In short, political sociology is a subject to study the tensions and conflicts arising from the socioeconomic environment of society
 raajnneeti vigyaan kii bhaanti raajnneetik samajashaastra samaaj main shakti sambandhon ke vitaran tathaa shakti vibhaajan kaa adhyayan hai is drushti se katipay vidwaan ise raajnneeti vigyaan kaa up-vishay bhi kehete he
 By analyzing the above definitions, the following features of 'political Sociology' are clear - atah yah spasht ho jaataa he ki ‘raajnneetik samajashaastra’ raajnneeti vigyaan or samajashaastra donon ke gunon ko apane main samavisht karte hue yah donon kaa adhik viksit rup main pratinidhitiv karata he
 Ss Lipset explains this by writing: If the stability of the social system is the central problem of sociology, then the stability of the political system or the social condition of the democracy is the main concern of political sociology

 -> madhya asia main buddha dharm, buddha dharm ke roopon ko sanderbhit karata he jo madhya asia main maujuud the, jo aitihaasik rup se silk road ke saath prachlit the
 The history of Buddhism in Central Asia is closely related to the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism during the first millennium of the Common Era
 puure madhya asia main kai shuruaati buddha vidhyalay aitihaasik rup se prachlit the
 Many scholars identify three distinct major phases of missionary activities seen in the history of Buddhism in Central Asia, which are associated with the following sects: dharmaguptaka ne afghanistan, madhya asia or china jaise kshetron main bharat ke baahar buddha dharm failaane ke liye kisi anya sampradaay kii tulana main adhik prayaas kiye, or unhen aisa karne main badi safalataa mili
 Therefore, most of the countries have adopted Buddhism from China, they have also adopted Dharmaguptaka Vinaya and ordination dynasty for begging and begging
 e ke anusaar worder, un purvi asian deshon main kuch myanon main, dharmaguptaka sampradaay ko vartmaan main jivit mana ja saktaa he

 Caste is the most basic and lower class in the biological classification of organisms
 jeevvaigyanik nazariye se aise jeevon ke samooh ko ek jati bulaayaa jaataa he jo ek dusre ke saath santan utpann karne kii kshamta rakhte ho or jinaki santan swayan aage santan janane kii kshamta rakhti ho
 For example, a wolf and a lion cannot bear children among themselves, so they are considered to be of different castes
 ek ghoda or gadhaa aapas main baccha paidaa kar sakate hai, lekin kyonki khachchar aage baccha janane main asamarth hote hai, isliye ghode or gadhe bhi alag jatiyon ke maane jate hai
 In contrast, dogs are found in very different sizes, but any male dog and female dog can have children that are capable of producing offspring themselves
 isliye sabhi kute, chaahe ve kisi nasal ke hi kyon na hon, jeevvaigyanik drushti se ek hi jati ke sadsy samajhe jate hai
 Different castes having similarities with each other, in which the biologists believe that they originated from the same ancestor in the past and have been divided into different branches over time through evolution, are put into the same biological lineage is
 masalan ghode, gadhe or zebra alag jatiyon ke hai lekin teenon ek hi 'ekwas' vansh ke sadsy maane jate hai
 The definition of castes in modern times is also done by examining other aspects
 udhaaharan ke liye anuvanshiki kaa prayog karke aksar jeevon kaa di en e parkhaa jaataa he or is aadhaar par un jeevon ko ek jati ghoshit kiya jaataa he jinaki di en e chhap ek duusare se milti ho or duusare jeevon se alag ho
 The definition used for the term "caste" and reliable methods of identifying caste are essential for biological tests and assessment of biodiversity

 Some zoologists may view statistical phenomena as opposed to the traditional idea of the class of species observed in animals
 aisi sthiti main kisi jati ko pruthak rup se shaamil vansh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo ekal jin pool kisanrachana karata he
 However, definitions such as dna-sequence and morphology, used to help isolate lineages that are highly related to each other, have clear limitations
 haalanki, "jati" shabd kii sateek paribhaasha abhi bhi vivaadaaspad he, visheshkar jeevakosh ke sambandh main, or yah jati samasya kehalaati he
 Biologists have given more detailed definitions, but there are only a few options used that depend on the characteristics of the respective castes
 aamtaur par istemaal kiye jane vaale paudhe or pashuon ke naam ko taxa kabhi-kabhi in jatiyon ke samaan hote hai: jaise, "sher", "walras," or "kapur kaa ped" - prayek jatiyon ko darshaate hai
 Other cases in which those names are not used: "deer" refers to a class of 34 castes, including eld deer, red deer, and reindeer
 baad vaali do jatiyon ko kabhi yah vyakhya karte hue ek hi jati mana jaataa tha ki vaigyanik gyaan badhane ke saath-saath jatiyon kii simaaen kitni parivartit ho sakati hai
 Due to the difficulties in defining both the world and calculating their total number, it is estimated that anywhere between two and 100 million / 2 to 100 million of this type can be different species
 adarsh rup main, kisi jati ko ek aupchaarik rup se vaigyanik naam diya jaataa he, haalanki vyavhaar main aisi bahut si jatiyaan hai 
 kisi jati kaa naam tab rakhaa jaataa he, jab ise vansh-varg / vansh-kram main rakhaa jaataa he
 From the scientific point of view, it can be considered a hypothesis that castes are much more related to the genus of other castes than to other lineages
 ek saamaanya jatiyon main shaamil he or / iske rup main sabase acha gyaat vargeekaran shrenee hai: jivan, kshetra, rajya, jati, varg, kram, parivaar, vansh or jati
 jinas ko iskaa nirdhaaran karnaa aparivarty nahin; koi vargeekaran vaigyanik baad main main ise bhinn jinas de saktaa he jis kaaran uskaa naam bhi badal jayega
 In biological nomenclature, a caste name has two parts, they are considered Latin, although the name and place of any native language or the name of a person can be used for it
 jati naam pehle ke baad doosraa shabd, vishesh naam soochibaddh he
 For example, the species known as the long-leaf pine is the genus Pinus palustris, whose brown wolves belong to the Canis lumpus, the Coytes canis latrans, the golden fox canis orus, and they all belong to the genus Canis
 Not only in other words, but caste names are completely bipedal

 At that time the main biological principle was that the freely represented species were originated by God and hence they are considered to be real and immutable, so that the hypothesis of common ancestry is not applicable
 pustakon or lekh main / inke sankshipt naam / rakhe jate hai or iske sankshipt naam ek vachan main "sp

 "sp

 It is astonishingly difficult to explain the term "caste" which applies to all natural beings and to biologists about how to interpret castes and how to identify real castes is called the caste problem
 adhikansh pathyapustakon main kisi jati "vaastavik or sambhavit antar nasl prakritik aabaadi vaale samooh" jo aise anya samooh prajnan ke taur par alag rakhe jate hai
 Various parts of this definition, such as some unusual or artificial intercourse, are excluded from it: uparokt adarsh pathyapustak vaali paribhaasha bahu-koshikeey praaniyon ke liye acchhee tarah kaary karti he lekin aisi bhi kuch paristhitiyaan hai jahaan par inhen anupyukt tehraaya ja saktaa he: Horizontal gene transfer makes the term "race" even more complicated to define

 All definitions of the term "race" that all of their genes are derived from one or two parents are exactly the same as that animal, but basic gene transfer seems to be misconceived
 ek sabase badhiya prashn yah he "jati" shabd jisaki vyakhya jeev vigyaani dete aae hai or is charchaa ko jatiyon kii samasya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Darwin wrote in Chapter II of On the Origin of Species
 lekin baad main, darwin ne apni The Descent of Man main yah kehete hue apane mat main sanshodhan kiya ki "kya maanav main ek yaa anek jatiyaan shaamil hai"
 The modern theory of development rests on new fundamental definitions of "caste"
 darwin se pehle, prakrutivaadiyon ne jatiyon ko adarsh yaa saamaanya prakaar ke rup main dekha, jiskaa udhaaharan kisi adarsh namoonay ke saath diya ja saktaa he jisamen saamaanya jati ke samaan ve sabhi gun uplabdh hai
 The uniformity of Darwin's theory shifted attention from the simple to the special
 bauddhik itihaaskaar louis minand ke anusaar, It transforms "caste" into a new approach; Darwin vyaavhaarik rup se, jeev vigyaniyon ne jatiyon ko paribhaashit praaniyon kii aabaadi jinamein anuvanshik samanta kaa str ucch hota he ke rup main kii he
 It can reflect the adaptation of the same organism and transfer varieties of genetic material from one potential to another

 The lack of any apparent caste deficiency in microbiology has led some authors to argue that the use of the term "caste" is not correct when studying bacteria
 iske bajaay unhone jin ko dur-daraaj se sambandhit bacteria ko sambandhit bacteria ko sampurna bacteria sambandhi kshetra ko ek jin vaale pool ke saath swatantra rup se vichrate hue dekhte hai
 Nevertheless, the rule of thumb was established stating that more than 97% of the same 16S rrna gene sequence bacteria or Archaea should be examined by DNA – DNA hybridization regardless of whether they belong to the same species

 This definition can be extended further by stating that a caste is a group of animals capable of potentially interbreeding breeding - fish can be kept in the same species even if they live in different lakes because they Interracial breeding can occur if they have ever come in contact with each other
 On the other hand, there are many examples of three or more bizarre populations of whether animals with intercultural populations can breed interculturally in other types of populations, but on the other hand, these populations are not capable of interbreeding
 is prakaar se, yah vishay bahes yogya he ki ye aabaadiyaan ek yaa do alag-alag jatiyaan banaati hai
 There is no contradiction in that species are defined based on gene frequencies and thus have ambiguous boundaries
 natijatan, "jati" kii saarvbhaumik paribhaasha aavashyak rup se ekapaksheeya he
 Instead, biologists have given many definitions; The use of which is the perfect choice for any zoologist depends on the characteristics of that zoologist's research
 abhyaas main, ye paribhaashaayen samaan hai or unke bich ekamusth virodhabhas kii tulana main unka maamla adhik mahatvapurn he
 Nevertheless, none of the concepts of caste proposed so far are fully objective or can apply in all cases without assistance for a decision
 jivan kii jatilta ko dekhte hue, kuch kaa kahana he ki is tarah ke ek uddeshy kii paribhaasha sabhi prakaar kii sambhaavnaaon main asambhav he or jeev vaigyanikon ko sabase adhik vyaavhaarik paribhaasha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa chahie
 It is the concept of all biological species in most spineless animals and is largely deficient in the phylogenetic race
 kai BSC up-jatiyon ko PSC ke antargat jati mana jaataa he; BSC or PSC ke bich antar kaa nirdhaaran kiya ja saktaa he kyonki BSC jati ko spasht vikasvaadi itihaas ke parinamswaroop jati ko paribhaashit karata he, jabaki PSC kisi jati ko spasht vikasvaadi sambhaavna ke parinamswaroop paribhaashit karata he
 In this way, the PSC castes were "created" as soon as the evolutionary lineage began to be separated, while the BSC caste began to emerge only when their lineage separation was complete
 tadnusaar, PSC banaam BSC ke aadhaar par vaikalpik vargeekaran ke bich paryaapt vivaad sambhav he kyonki unke taxa ke vyavhaar ke aadhaar par ve bilkul bhinn hai, use baad vaale model ke antargat up-jatiyaan maanya hongi
 Life-supporting castes: Many castes are absolutely bizarre towards adaptation to the environment, as they are capable of yielding or breeding under certain conditions such as drought, desertification, flooding, soil poisoning, soil salinity, many of which are food
 , Providing materials and empowering humans, livestock and other animals are considered potentially beneficial to humans A
 These are known as life-supporting nations
 jiseki unamem parsparik mukhya jatiyaan shaamil hai kyonki inke paas bhu-akritiyon kii akhandta kii mukhya kunjee hoti he jisamen donon praaniyon ke biodeta or maanav samudaay shaamil hai
 Both ecological and socioeconomic castes are tributaries for life
 jatiyon ke vargeekaran ke saath purvollekhith samasyaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue nimnlikhit sankhya keval naam maatr kaa maargdarshan he
 In 2007, they were as follows: jatiyon kii kul sankhya : 7-100 million sahit: Among the Eukaryte castes, we could only identify them: vartmaan main, global texonomi inishiative, european distributed institute of texonomi or censos of marine life texonomi sudhaar kaa prayaas kar rahe hai or pehle se agyaat jatiyon ko texonomi system ko amal main laa rahe hai
 Due to the fact that we know only a few creatures in the living room, yet we do not have full understanding of the functioning of our environment
 professor james melette ke anusaar ham nai jatiyon kii khoj ke baavjood maamalon ko bad se badtar banaate ja rahe hai or ham in jatiyon ko abhootpurv gati ke saath samaapt karte ja rahe hai
 It also means that it must be studied and classified before acquiring a new race, since it may have already become extinct
 jatiyon kii dharna kaa lanbaa itihaas he
 This is one of the most important levels of classification for several reasons: varshon ke prayog ke baad, jeev vigyaan kii avadharana or sambandhit kshetra ke mejabaan ke rup main pramukh rahi he lekin abhi tak ise purna rup se paribhaashit nahin kii gai he
 The nomenclature of a particular caste should be considered hypotheses about the evolutionary relationship and diversity of the organisms of that group
 agrim jaankaree haath main aate hi pariklpana kii pushti yaa uskaa khandan kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes, especially when communication was much more difficult in the past, classification scientists working on segregation gave different names to different animals that were later identified as a common race
 jab do naam vaali jati kii khoj ek jati ke rup main kii gai, to puraani jati kaa naam aamtaur se kaayam rakhaa gaya or nai jati ke naam ko vah naam de diya gaya, ek aisi prakriya jo ekatrikaran ke rup main paryaayavacheekaran yaa bolchaal kii prakriya kehalaati he
 The division of a texon into more than one is usually called a texon
 vargeekaran vaigyanikon ko aamtaur se unke sahpaathiyon dwaara unhen "lanpar" yaa "splitre" kaha jaataa he, jo jantuon ke bich pahachaane jane vaale antar par unke vyaktigat drushtikon or samaantaaon par nirbhar karata he
 Traditionally, researchers have relied on the observation of structural differences and the observation of whether or not their differential reproduction was successfully carried out for differences in castes in different populations; Both anatomy and reproductive behavior are still important to state the status of castes
 pichley kuch dashakon main, sookshmjeevigyaani anusandhan takanic main kranti ke parinamswaroop jaise DNA vishleshan se jatiyon ke bich antar or samaantaaon ke bare main athaah gyaan uplabdh ho gaya he
 Many populations formerly considered as separate castes are now considered a taxon and the pre-grouped population is divided
 koi vargeekaran str kaa paryaayavacheekaran yaa vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or ucch texonomik str par ye sanshodhan abhi bhi bahut athaah hai
 From the classification point of view, groups in race can be defined more as Texon classification than race
 praanivigyaan main keval up-jatiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jabaki vanaspati vigyaan main vividhta, up-vividhta or swaroop kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 In conservation biology, the evolutionary critical unit is used that can be defined as a segment with a caste or more small bizarre population
 vigyaan ke praarambhik kaary main, jati keval alag-alag praani hote the jo apane samaan yaa lagbhag samaan praaniyon ke samooh kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 At that time no other relations were applicable to them
 arestu ne jinas or jati shabd kaa upyog jatigat yaa vishesh virgon ke liye kiya
 Aristotle and other pre-darwinian scientists considered castes to be special and immutable as chemical elements such as "essence"
 When the early observers began to develop the organization as a system for organisms, they began to place the segregated space beforehand
 inamen se kai praarambhik chithran yojanaon ko ab sanakee nahin mana jayega or inamen samarktata ke aadhaar par rang yaa vyavhaar shaamil hai
 In the 18th century, Swedish scientist Carolus Linnaeus classified organisms according to reproductive organs
 haalanki jeevon ke vargeekaran ke unke prakaar ne samanta ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya, lekin unhone samaan jatiyon ke bich sambandh ke bare main koi daawa nahin kiya
 
 At that time, it was still widely believed that no one among the castes believed that there was any biological connection between the biological castes, no matter how similar they looked
 This approach also suggested a kind of idealism: the notion that all the existing castes are an "ideal form"
 haalanki vahaan par sabhi jeevon ke bich hameshaa hi matbhed hai, to bhi linius ne aise antar ko samasyapurna mana
 unhone alag-alag jeevon kii pahchaan karne kaa prayaas kiya jo jatiyon kaa anukaraniya tha or anya gaiyr-anukaraniya jeevon asaamaanya or apurna mana
 By the 19th century most naturalists understood that caste could change from time to time, and that the history of the home gave enough time for major changes in them
 jin-baptist lamark ne Zoological Philosophy main sristi-rachana-siddhant ke viruddh pehla taarkik vichaar diya
 There was a new preference for determining how castes might change over time
 lamark ne suzav diya ki jeev kisi praapt gun ko apane aane vaale vansh main pahunchaa saktaa he jaise jiraph kii lambii gardan oonche pedo kii pattiyon tak pahunchnaa jiraph kii peedi kaa gun tha
 However, with Charles Darwin's acceptance of the natural selection idea in 1860, Lanmark's approach to goal-oriented development, also known as the teleological process, was rendered ineffective
 pashchjanan sambandhi prakriyaayein jaise mithailation ke aas-paas praapt visheshtaon ke vanshanukram main haal hi kii ruchi jo DNA kram ko prabhavit nahin karti, lekin viraasatiya tareeke se abhivyakti ko badla ja saktaa he
 Thus, neo-lamarckism, as it has sometimes been talked about, that the theory of evolution is not a challenge with natural selection
 charles darwin or alfred veles vah vichaar diya jiskaa paalan aaj bhi vaigyanik vikaas ke siddhant kaa sabase shaktishaalee or sammohak rup main karte hai
 Darwin argued that this included population was not just a creature
 unka tark linius kii kattarpanthi dhara ke pariprekshya kii tulana main adhik vishwasaneey he:jati kii vyakhya adarsh shabd ke rup main karne kii bajaay, darwin ne jeevon ke bich antar ko prakritik mana
 unhone aage tark diya ki samasyagrastata se dur durlabh jati ke astitv ke liye vastav main uskaa spashtikaran kiya
 Darwin's work drew on Thomas Malthus' insight that the growth rate of organic populations would always be ahead of the growth rate of resources in the environment, such as the supply of food
 As a result, Darwin argued that not all organisms in the population would be able to subsist and breed
 unke dwaara kiye jane vaale kaary ausatan lekin unamem antar hoga - haalanki ve use thodaa bahut paryaavaran ke anukool banaaenge
 agar ye gunon vaale antar paitruk rahe to jivit rahane waalon kaa vansh unhen dhaaran kar legaa
 In this way, adaptive variations will accumulate in the population over many generations, while the hostile traits will disappear
 is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki kya paryaavaran main koi antar anukuli he yaa gaiyr anukuli: bhinn-bhinn paryaavaran alag alag gunon kaa paksh lete hai
 Because the environment effectively chooses which creature to survive for reproduction and it is the environment that determines which qualities should go forward
 yah prakritik chayan ke dwaara vikaas kaa siddhant he
 In this model, the neck length of a giraffe would be interpreted according to the situation that the long-necked proto-giraffe acquired special reproductive traits from the short-necked giraffe
 For many generations, the entire population would have belonged to long-necked animals
 
 1859 main, jab darwin ne prakritik chayan kaa apana siddhant prakashit kiya, to us samay vanshanukram ke vyaktigat gunon vaale tantra kaa gyaan nahin tha
 Although Darwin made some assumptions about inheritance of virtue, his theory was based only on the fact that inheritance properties exist and are mutable
 haalanki grager mendal anuvanshiki par shodh-patr ko uski visheshtaon kii pahchaan kiye bina hi 1866 main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This was not done until 1900 when his work was rediscovered by Hugo de Verais, Carl Correns, and Erick von Semark, when they realized that Darwin's theory had "inherited properties" genes
 prakritik chayan ke madhyam se vikaas kii jatiyon ke vargeekaran main jatiyon kii charchaa ke liye do mahatvapurn manyataayen he - ve parinaam lineyas kii texonomi ke paksh main anumaanon ko moolbhoot rup se chunauti detii hai
 At first it showed that castes are not only the same but they can also be really related
 darwin ke kuch chaatro kaa tark he ki sabhi jatiyaan aam purvaj kii vanshaj hai
 Second, it is assumed that "caste" is not homogeneous, stable, permanent things; Caste members are completely different and castes have changed a long time ago
 is baat se pataa chalata he ki jatiyon kii koi vishesh seemaa kshetra nahin he lekin lagaataar badalati jin-aavritiyon ke sankhyikeey prabhaav padate hai
 Still, one can use the classification of Linnaeus to identify plants and animals, but no one can think of an independent and immutable form of castes anymore
 paitruk vansh se kisi nai jati main vikaas hona speshiation kehalaata he
 The progeny caste has no clear lineage demarcation from its descendant caste
 haalanki jatiyon ke vartmaan vaigyanik gyaan se yah pataa chalaa he ki sabhi maamalon main vibhinn jatiyon ke bich antar sthapit karne ke liye koi thos or vyapak tarika nahin he, taaki jeev vigyaani is vichaar ke sanchaalan ko jari rakhane ke liye thos tareekon kii talash jari rakhen
 jati ke bare main sabase lokapriy jaivik paribhaasha main se ek prajnan algaav ke sandarbh main he, agar do praani donon lingon ke sankar vansh kaa prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hote, to ve bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke hote hai
 Intuitive castes have limitations in this definition, but are incomplete
 udhaaharan ke liye un jati ke bare main kuch nahin kahana he jo alangik tareeke se prajnan karte hai or use vilupt hoti ja raheen jatiyon par lagu karnaa bada mushkil he
 In addition, the boundaries between castes are often unclear: there are instances where members of a particular population breed fertile hybrid offspring of creatures from a second population and members of a second population cultivate fertile hybrids from creatures with a third population
 Can breed offspring but members of the first and third populations cannot breed fertile hybrids or only fertile offspring from parents Birth is possible
 natijatan, kuch log jati kii is paribhaasha ko asweekaar karte hai
 Richard Dakins describes the two organisms as homogeneous and if they have the same number of chromosomes and for each chromosome, both creatures have the same number of chromosomes
 However, most all classification scientists will disagree with this point
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai ubhaycharon main, vishesh rup se newjiland main, leopelma mendhakon ke jinom main "mul" jinom hote hai jo bilkul bhinn nahin hote or gaun gunasutra hote hai jo bahut se sanyojanon main maujuud hai
 Although extreme differences are found in the number of chromosomes of the population, they can successfully differentiate and form a single developmental unit
 paudhon main, poliflidi antar prajnan par kuch rokthaamon vaala atyadhik saamaanya sthaan he; kyonki praaniyon ke gunasutron ke set sam sankhya se visankramit kiye jate hai, jo vartmaan gunasutron ke set kii vaastavik sankhya par nirbhar karata he jahaan vahi vikaskaari ikai ke kuch praani kuch anya ke saath antar prajnan kar sakate hai or kuch nahin or usamen puri aabaadi ko visheshtaur se ek saamaanya jin pool banane ke rup main joda gaya he
 Classification of species is particularly affected by technological advances that allowed researchers to link their evidence based on molecular traces, to acute evidence of crude blood plasma, in the mid-20th century ground-breaking DNA-DNA hybridization study of Charles Sibley, In 1970, the comparison gave rise to DNA sequencing techniques
 in takneekon ke parinamswaroop ucch texonomik virgon main krantikari parivartan aayaa, jisase filogenetic ped kii bahut si shakhaon kii punarvyavastha vaale parinaam praapt hue

 The turtle was determined to develop at the molecular level with only one-eighth of the speed of other reptiles, and the rate of molecular evolution in albatross is found to be only half that of storum-petrels
 aajkal aprachlit sankaran takanic uplabdh he or anukram kii tulana ke liye or adhik vishwasaneey computesnal drushtikon dwaara badali jaati he
 Molecular taxonomy is not directly based on evolutionary processes, but overall changes are made by these processes
 ve prakriyaayein jo peedi or vividhta vaale rakrakhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai jaise parivartan, badlaav kii prakriya or chayan samroop nahin hai
 DNA is only the rarer direct target of natural selection rather than a change in DNA sequence during generations on the latter outcome; For example, the silent transit-substitution combination would alter the melting point of the DNA sequence, but not the sequence of the encoded protein, and for example where for microorganisms, the changes in themselves consider changes in their fitness

 The name of Leela Seth is well known due to the law examination in London being the top in 1958, becoming a member of the 15th Law Commission of India and a special contribution in some well-known judicial matters
 nyaayamurti lila kii shaadi paariwarik madhyam se bata - company main sarvice karne vaale premi ke saath hui
 At that time, Leela was not even a graduate, later Premo had to go for a job in England, she went along and graduated from there, it was not possible for her to go to regular college, thought there should be a course which does not require Hajri and daily
 So she made up her mind to study law, where she was successful in the bar examination

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, sparsh-sangharshi yaa sangharshi vyanjanon main badal gayi, jaise : c, ja, sa or sha
 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d
 inamen baltic, slav, hind irani, armenian or albanian shakhan aati hai
 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d

 Because it cannot always be said which genes are more likely to prove, the best option is the inertia of conservation
 It is possible to assure as many genes as possible
 For ecologists, this latter approach is sometimes considered too restrictive, as it is considered ecological

 Purebred naturally evolved region specific wild species can be threatened with extinction in a big way through the process of genetic pollution i

 In agriculture and animal husbandry, the use of the Green Revolution popularized traditional hybridization by making multiple layers to increase yield "high yielding varieties"
 The handful of plants and cattle breeds often hybridized in developed countries and hybridized with further localized varieties In the rest of the developing world, high-yield strains were resistant to local climates and diseases

due to complete disuse because of un-profitability and uncontrolled intentional and unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding ) formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution resulting in great loss in genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole
 A] is an organism whose gene tick content has been altered using this genetic engineering technique commonly known as recombinant DNA technology
 Genetically modified crops today are not only a common source for genetic contamination of wild varieties, But also other domesticated varieties have become relatively derived from natural hybridization
 It is being said that genetic erosion coupled with genetic pollution is destroying that needed unique genetic base thereby creating an unforeseen hidden crisis which will result in a severe threat to our food security for the future when diverse genetic material will cease to exist to be able to further improve or hybridize weakening food crops and livestock against more resistant diseases and climatic changes
 Conservation of this biodiversity has become a global concern

 In-situ is generally seen as an ideal conservation strategy

 For example, destruction of rare or endangered species' habitat sometimes requires prior conservation efforts around it
 In addition, the former can provide a backup solution for in-situ conservation — in situ conservation projects
