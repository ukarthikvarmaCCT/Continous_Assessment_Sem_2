 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii

 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya

 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha

 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi

 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims

 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted
 ambedkar buddha dharm ko pasand karte the kyonki usamen teen siddhanton kaa samanvit rup miltaa he jo kisi anya dharm main nahin miltaa
 Buddhism teaches wisdom, compassion and equity
 unka kahana tha ki manushya inhen baton ko shubh tathaa aanandit jivan ke liye chahta he
 God and soul cannot save society
 ambedkar ke anusaar sachcha dharm wo hi he jiskaa kendra manushya tathaa naitikta ho, vigyaan athwa bauddhik tatv par aadhaarit ho, na ki dharm kaa kendra ishwar, aatma kii mukti or moksh
 At the same time, he said that the work of religion should be to rebuild the world and not to explain its origin and end
 vah janatantric samaaj vyavastha ke pakshdhar the, kyonki unka maananaa tha aisi sthiti main dharm maanav jivan kaa maardarshak ban saktaa he
 He got all these things in the only Buddhism

 Granville Austin described the Indian Constitution prepared by Ambedkar as 'the first and most important social document'
 'bharat ke adhikansh sanvaidhanik praavdhaan yaa to saamaajik kranti ke uddeshy ko aage badhaane yaa isaki uplabdhi ke liye jaruri sthitiyon kii sthapana karke is kranti ko badhaava dene ke prayaas main sidhe pahunche hai

 vastav main, main kah saktaa hoon ki agar kabhi kuch galat hua to iskaa kaaran yah nahi hoga ki hamaara samvidhan kharaab tha balki iskaa upyog karne vaala manushya adham tha
 Ambedkar opposed Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which gave special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and which was included in the constitution against his wishes

 But the Indian government should have only limited powers and the Indian people should not have any rights in Kashmir
 is prastaav ko sahmati dene ke liye, main bharat ke kanoon mantri ke rup main bharat ke hiton ke khilaaf ek vishwasghaatee baat hongi, yah kabhi nahin karegaa

 After all, what are we doing for this freedom? We are getting this freedom to improve our social system, which is full of inequality, discrimination and other things that conflict with our fundamental rights
 ambedkar vastav main samaan naagarik samhita ke pakshdhar the or kashmir ke maamle main dhara 370 kaa virodh karte the

 After the death of Ayuka Khan, the Russian Empire began to pressurize the colonies
 unke kshetron main roosi log basane lage or unpar buddha dharm chhodkar roosi parmparik isai banane kaa jor daalaa gaya
 Ayuki Khan's great-grandson Ubashi Khan became the last Khan of Kalmykas
 uske netritv main do lakh kaalmik apni purvajon kii mathrubhumi zungaaria ke liye kooch kar gayi, haalanki bahut se kaalmik unke saath nahin gayi
 On the way, the Kazakh and Kyrgyz tribesmen killed or enslaved many by returning the Kalikis with numerous attacks
 kai maheenon ke kathin safar ke baad keval 96,000 kaalmik hi manchhu samrajya kii pashchimi seemaa par balaash jhil ke kinare pahunch paae
 In Kalmykia, then the Russian Emperor Catherine ended the Kalmiki khanat
 bahut se sthaneey kaalmik log ab sidhaa roosi samrajya ke naagarik ban gaye or uske liye kaam karne lage
 Traditionally the nomadic community also started building pucca houses, temples and settlements
 1865 main elistaa kii niv rakhi gai jo aadhunik yug main kalmikia kii rajdhani he
 When the October Socialist Revolution in 1917, the Kalamikis who settled on the banks of both rivers joined the anti-white Russian army of socialism

 Many others were killed
 don kalmikiyon ko chhodkar anya kalmikiyon ko krantikari netaa vladimir lenin ne apil kari kii agar ve samaajwaad kaa saath den to soviet sarkaar unhen apni bhoomi degi
 On 4 November 1920, he fulfilled his promise and the Kalamik Autonomous Oblast was inaugurated
 15 saal baad 22 oktober 1935 ko iskaa darja badhaakar ise ganatantr bana diya gaya or iskaa naam 'kaalmik swashasit soviet samaajawaadee ganatantr' ho gaya
 In 1931, under the policy of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, his grouping broke many Buddhist monasteries, burned religious texts and sent all the kalamikis who owned more than 500 sheep to Siberia
 is se krishi thapp hui or bhukhmaree main 1932-33 kaal main 60,000 kaalmik mar gayi
 On 22 June 1944, the German Army invaded the Soviet Union, and on 12 August 1942, Kalistiya's capital, Alista, was captured
 unhone prachaar or jabardastee karke bahut se kaalmik yuvakon ko soviet-virdohi sainik daston main sangathit kiya
 These squads killed many Soviet soldiers
 disambar 1942 main pasa palat gaya or soviet laal sena kaa kalmikia par phir se qabza ho gaya
 Although many Kalamikas fought against the Soviet Union, their majority still remained loyal to the Soviet Union and were soldiers in the Red Army
 disambar 1943 tak 8,000 kalamikon ko soviet sena main bahaduree ke tamanne mil chuke the or 21 ko 'soviet sangh kaa nayak' naamak sarvocch padak bhi mila tha
 Stalin became enraged by the anti-soviet periodic squads and on 27 December 1943, the Soviet government declared the Kalmyk community to be criminals of the German army

 In order to keep small amounts of foods cold for domestic use, refrigerators started to be manufactured commercially from 1917 AD and by 1925 AD they became accessible to the general public
 aarambh main to gaschalit yantra hi banaae gaye, lekin ab kuch varsho se vidyutshakti chaalit prashithitr sarvapriya ho gayi hai
 Nowadays, it takes almost the same to see the shelves of all types of refrigerators
 inke bheetar porcillen kii parat or baahar kii taraf gadha pralaksharas lep laga hota he
 According to the price of different models, the insulation installed in the walls of the refrigerator is 2 to 4 inches thick
 ooshmaarodhak jitna hi adhik motaa hoga utana hi adhik prabhavakaari rahegaa, kyonki adhiktar vayumandal kii garmi, deevaaron main se hokar hi bhojanpatro main, pravisht hoti he
 The function of keeping food in a refrigerant is by changing the physical condition of a refrigerant medium
 at: ek achche prasheetak-madhyam main nimnlikhit gunon kaa hona aavashyak he : Ammonia gas, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, dichlor-difluor-methane are the major gases used in refrigeration
 keval barf dwaara tathaa yantra dwaara chalanevaale prashithitron kaa siddhant vastut: ek hi he, kyonki donon main hi bhojanpatro kii garmi kaa aavasoshana madhyam ke bhautik parivartan dwaara hi hota he
 In the first, the ice melts to become water, and in the second, the refrigerant fluid is converted to gas by the device
 bahuchalit prasheetak is prakaar se banaae jate hai ki unamem hawa kaa parivahan barf kii silli ke neeche kii taraf se hi hota he or barf vahiin galati rahati he
 So, as long as the food room is closed, its temperature remains between 60 and 80, no matter how thin the ice box is
 is prakaar ek silli 4-5 dinon tak chal jaati he
 There are two types of automatic refrigerators, one on the principle of compression and the other on the principle of absorption
 in donon kii hi sanvrutt pranaaliyon main prasheetak-madhyam parivahan karata rahata he
 When the refrigerant-liquid filled in the evaporator inside them forms a gas, the heat of the food is absorbed and condensed into a condensate coil, which is always in contact with the air, and becomes liquid again
 inamen ek tapasthapi naame upkaran bhi laga rahata he, jiske dwaara khadyakaksh ke taap par niyantran rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In refrigeration devices operating on the principle of compression, or a motor of horsepower is employed to initiate the device's mechanism, by which condensation from a gaseous refrigerant-medium vaporizer such as sulfur dioxide or dichlorhydrofluor methane is induced into the coil
 phir inamen se ek vishesh kapaat main se guzarakar udvashpak main waapas aa jate hai
 These valves are also of two types
 ek to prasarak kapaat, jiske dwaara sanghanit prasheetak ek baarik phuhaare ke rup main bikharakar vaashpitra main pravisht hota he or jisase uskaa ekadam hi, aanshik rup main, vaashp ban jaataa he
 The second type is the plasma valve, which performs its work when a large amount of refrigerant-fluid is collected inside the evaporator and only then the action cycle is repeated
 avasorana ke siddhant par chalanevaale prashithitron main ammonia gas thande pani main saralata se ghul jaati he or pani ke garam hone par saralata se nikal bhi jaati he
 Therefore, a flame of oil or gas is used to heat water
 pani se alag hone par ammonia gas saghanan kundaliyon main jaakar dravit ho vaashpitra main bah aati he, jahaan hydrogen ke madhyam se sanghnitr kii daab itani kam ho jaati he ki vah drav phir se vashpit hone lagata he
 Then, as soon as the mixture of hydrogen and ammonia gas from the evaporator reaches the absorber cell, a fine spray of water is found in it
 isse ammonia gas to pani main ghul jaati he tathaa pani main aviley hydrogen vaashpitra main waapas laut jaataa he
 Here, the ammonium hydroxide enters the evaporator and restores the action cycle
 is prakaar ke yantra main garmi or thandak kaa aadan pradaan nirantar hote rahane ke kaaran isaki banaavat to badi hi pechida ho jaati he, lekin yantra kii kaaryakshmata acchhee rahati he

 Ved Vyas knew this incident immediately from the power of yoga
 ve gandhari ke paas aakar bole, "gandhari tuune bahut galat kiya
 My given groom never goes wrong

 "gandhari got hundred kundas made according to his knowledge
 vedavyas ne gandhari ke garbh se nikle mansapind par abhimantrit jal chhidaka jise us pind ke anguthe ke poruye ke baraabar sau tukade ho gayi
 Ved Vyas ordered those pieces to be built in a hundred pools of Gandhari and after two years, ordered them to open them and went to his ashram

 But Dhritarashtra could not abandon him due to son-in-law
 phir un kundon se dhritarashtra ke shesh 99 putr evam dushshla naamak ek kanya kaa janm hua
 Gandhari was unable to serve Dhritarashtra at the time of her pregnancy and hence a maid was appointed to serve her

 agex web vikaas takneekon kaa ek samooh he jiskaa upyog interective web anuprayog ke nirmaan ke liye graahak paksh par kiya jaataa he
 With Ajax, the web application can retrieve data asynchronously from the server in the background, with no interruptions from the display and behavior of the present page
 ajaks takneekon ke upyog ne web pej par interective yaa gatisheel interphes main vruddhi kii he
 The data is usually retrieved using the xmlhttprequest object
 naam ke baavjood javascript or XML kaa upyog vakstav main zaruri nahin hota he, naa hi request ke atulykaalik hone kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Like DHTML and LAMP, Ajax is not a technology in itself, but a set of technologies
 ajaks nimna ke ek sangyojan ko kaam main letaa he: Techniques for asynchronous loading of materials came in the mid-1990s
 java bhashaa ke pehle sanskaran main java amelet kii shuruyaat san 1995 main hui
 These allow compiled client-side code to load data asynchronously after a web page has been loaded
 haalanki, is lakshan ko vyapak rup se tabhi janaa jane laga jab ise Gmail or Google Maps ke dwaara upyog main laayaa gaya
 The term "ajax" came up in 2005
 jesi james garet ke dimag main shabd "ajaks" tab aayaa jab ve naha rahe the, us samay ve ek graahak ke liye praudyogikiyon ke pratinidhitiv ke liye ek sankshipt rup kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahe the
 April 5, 2006 The World Wide Web Consortium released the first draft statement for the object to create an official web standard
 shabd ajaks web praudyogikiyon ke k bade samooh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jinka upyog ek aise web anuprayog ke kriyanvayan ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo prishthbhumi main ek sarwar ke saath sanchaar karata he, is dauraan yah pej kii vartmaan sthiti main koi hastkshep nahin karata he
 In the article where the word Ajax was given, Jesse James Garrett clarified that the following technologies are needed: XML or XSLT
 Since then, there have been many developments in the definition of the word Ajax and the technologies used in the Ajax application
 vishesh rup se yah note kiya gaya he ki: Other languages such as vbscript also deserve the required functionality
 haalankijawa script ajaks programing ke liye sabase lokapriy bhashaa he, kyonki yah adhikansh aadhunik web brouzars ke saath sangat he or unamem shaamil he
 Classical Ajax involves the writing of ad hoc javascript on the client

net kaa apadet panel
 upkaran jaise Echo2 or ZK keval maanak java script libraries kaa upyog karte hue sarwar se ek pej ke fine grand niyantran ko sakasham banataa he
 Material is reloaded on every request, using the traditional methods used
 haalanki, ajaks kaa upyog karte hue, ek web anuprayog keval us saamagree kii request karata he jise apadet kiye jane kii zaroorat hoti he, is prakaar se bandwidth ke upyog or lod ke samay ko bahut adhik kam karata he
 Users make applications faster and more responsive, even when the application has not changed on the server side
 aas paas ke kaaryon main adrishy iframes kaa upyog shaamil he, jo brouzar kii history main parivartan karte hai or URL ke ankar hisse main parivartan karte hai jab ajaks chal rahaa hota he or parivartanon ke liye iskaa niyantran karata he
 Solutions to this problem exist, many of which use the URL fragment identifier to keep track of it and allow the user to return to the application at a given stage
 screen pathakon jo ajaks kaa upyog karne main sakasham he vah gatik rup se utpann saamagree ko thik prakaar se padhne main aksham ho saktaa he
 The only way to make the user work is to go back to the non-javascript method
 This can be done by creating a fixed link, and the forms can be resolved properly and they do not depend only on Ajax
 javascript main iske baad "ritern falls' ke saath form jamaa karne kii prakriya ko galat kiya ja saktaa he
 Developers familiar with other web technologies should learn coding methods and new tests for writing secure Ajax applications

 The legal profession is the profession by which the people concerned study, develop and implement the method
 vartmaan samay main vidhik vritti chunane ke icchhuk vyakti ko pehle vidhi main degree praapt karnaa hota he yaa koi anya vidhik shiksha praapt kerani padati he
 Initially, the legal profession was to help clarify the deepening of the law in the court
 aaj bhi iskaa mukhya kaary yahi he
 Apart from this, today advocates are not only legal experts, but also directors of society
 aadhunik samaaj kaa swaroop evam pragati mukhyat: vidhi dwaara niyantrit hoti he or vidhansabhaon dwaara nirmit vidhi keval saidhantik mul niyam hoti he, uske shadjaal ko vyavasthit kar jo swaroop chahen adhivaktaa use pradaan karte hai
 Therefore, the practical form of the law is made by the advocates only, with the help of which the society progresses
 vidhik vritti aadhunik samaaj kaa mukhya aadhaar stambh he
 The form and construction of the law is inherently related to and balanced by legalities
 vidhi kaa rup tabhi parishkrut evam parimarjeet ho paata he jab us desh kii vidhik vritti pusht or parishkrut hoti he
 In the ancient era, the entire power of society was in the hands of the chief
 tab vidhi kaa swaroop bahut aadim tha
 As soon as the judiciary came from the hands of the communities, the form of the law began to grow, because now the rules would be in the form of public principle, not the arbitrary wishes of the individual
 vidhi ke utkarsh main sadaa kisi samudaay kii sahaayta rahi he
 The first judges in Central Asia, the saints in preaching countries, the judges in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the advocates and arbitrators in Greece, the judges in Rome, the advocates and jurists, the judges, advocates and attorneys in medieval Britain and France, and the jurists in India, justified the first law
 Gave shape prayek desh kaa kram yahi rahaa he ki vidhinirmaan kramash: dharmadhikariyon ke niyantran se swatantra hokar vidhikaron ke kshetra main aata gaya
 In the face of the pure intellectual thinking of the legal experts, the discipline of the bishops has deteriorated
 aarambh main vyakti nyaayalay main swayan pakshanivedan karte the, kisi vishesh dwaara pakshanivedan kii pratha nahin thi
 As the form of the law was refined, complexity and technicality began to come in it, so it became necessary for a person to understand the esoteric elements of the law by an expert and make a formal request in the court
 kabhi vyakti kii nijee kathinaaiyon ke kaaran bhi yah aavashyak hota ki vah apni anupasthiti main kisi ko pratinidhi rup main nyaayalay main bhej de
 Thus the convenience of personal convenience and the legal form of law gave rise to advocates
 paashchaatya evam purvi donon deshon main vidhigyaataaon ne sadaa se samaaj main, vidvan hone ke kaaran, bada samaan praapt kiya
 Fascinated by his fame and reputation, many youth of the society started getting attracted towards legal science

 It became a fruitful business respectively

 There are always two types of experts in the legal profession - one who represents and represents the court on behalf of the other person, and the other who does not go to court and do the overriding but takes the legal responsibility of the claim in all other ways

 They were allowed to take proper remuneration

 In the thirteenth century in England, pure legal instinct emerged
 isse purv vidhik vritti dharmik sansthaaon se sambandhit thi
 The distinction between advocate and law assistant was present here as well
 aarambh main nyaayalay kii vishesh anumati praapt kar hi adhivaktaa dwaara pakshanivedan kiya jaataa; kramash: yah saadhaaran vyavhaar ban gaya
 From the time of Edward I, there could have been claims of negligence and deception against the lawyer against the party
 kaaman lau adhivaktaa tathaa dharmik sansthaaon ke adhivaktaaon main bhed kiya gaya tathaa unhen kaaman lau nyaayalayon main vishesh avasaron ke atirikt vaktrutv kaa adhikaar nahin rahaa
 According to the Year Book, it was only in the thirteenth fourteenth century that the advocacy community in the country took proper shape and was the main power of the legal system of England

 Therefore, in England, the law was independent of religious curb and progressed in pure form
 bhartiya arya parampara ke anusaar adikaal se vidhipurna nyaay kii apeksha kii jaati thi
 The king would always be law-abiding as a judge
 rigvaidic kaal main purohit, vidhigyaata, evam dharmasutrakaal main vidhipanditon evam unki sabhaaon kii sahaayta se nyaayprashasan hota
 In Gautamasutra this type of legalism is described by the name of Pravivak, who presumably took the form of judge respectively
 brihaspati kaa kathan he ki nyaayalay ke samaksh trutipurna yachika asweekrut ho jaati
 It is clear from this that the form of law had become very technical and the assistance of legal experts was necessary in the work of justice

 Many of the claims of the East India Company receive descriptions of pleadings by lawyers
 bharat ke antim swatantra shaasha bahadurshah ke samay main gyaat hota he ki ek vyakti ko chatur adhivaktaa hone ke liye vakaalat khan kii padavi di gai thi
 From the time of Aurangzeb, lawyers were both state and ordinary

 The lawyer-e-government was paid one rupee per day
 yah aavashyak tha ki sab adhivaktaa vakalatnama lekar hi pakshanivedan karen
 After that, in the time of the East India Company, there were regulation clauses related to advocates in particular states
 sarvapratham 1793 i

 In the present times, barristers are solicitors, lawyers, pleaders, Mukhtars, revenue agents, officers of the advocate

 The cognitive development theory propounded by Piaget is a comprehensive theory related to the nature of human intelligence and its development
 pyaaze kaa maananaa tha ki vyakti ke vikaas main uskaa bachapan ek mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa karata he
 The theory of piaget is called the developmental theory
 yah siddhanth gyaan kii prakruti ke bare main he or batalaata he ki maanav kaise gyaan kramshah iskaa arjan karata he, kaise ise ek-ek kar jodta he or kaise iskaa upyog karata he
 One articulates elements of the environment; That is, recognizes, tries to understand them with the help of symbols and thinks abstractly in the context of the object / person concerned
 ukt sabhi prakriyaaon se milakar uske bheetar ek gyaan bhandar yaa sangyanatmak sanrachana uske vyavhaar ko nirdeshit karti hai
 In this way, we can say that no person reacts directly to the stimulants of any kind in the environment, first he recognizes, accepts, and interprets those stimulants
 is prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki sangyatma sanrachana vaataavaran main upasthit uddipakon or vyavhaar ke bich madhyasthata kaa kaary karata hai
 Jean Onion studied cognitive development extensively

 When a child is born, there are spontaneous actions within it
 in sahaj kriyaaon or gyanandriyon kii sahaayta se baccha vastuon dhwanion, sparsh, raso evam gandhon kaa anubhav praapt karata he or in anubhavon kii punrariti ke kaaran vaataavaran main upasthit uddipakon kii kuch visheshtaon se parichit hota he
 In this state, the child, instead of being self-centered and selfish, earns knowledge by contacting others
 ab vah khel, anukaran, chitra nirmaan tathaa bhashaa ke madhyam se vastuon ke sambandh main apni jaankaree adhikadhik badhaata he
 Gradually he accepts the symbols, but what is the relation of any work and remain ignorant of logical thinking
 is avasthaa main anukramanshiltaa paayi jaati he
 At this stage, maturity comes in the simulation of the child
 is avasthaa main balak vidhyalay janaa pranrabh kar letaa he evam vastuon ev ghatnaon ke bich samanta, bhinnata samajhane kii kshamta utpan ho jaati he is avasthaa main baalkon main sankhya bodh, vargeekaran, krmanusaar vyavastha kisi bhi vastu ,vyakti ke madhya parsparik sambandh kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 He can reason
 sankshep main vah apane chaaron ore ke paryaavaran ke saath anukool karne ke liye anek niyam ko sikh letaa he
 This stage is after 12 years, the characteristic of this stage is as follows: - jin piyaaje ne sangyanatmak vikaas kii prakiya main mukhyatah do baton ko mahatvapurn mana he
