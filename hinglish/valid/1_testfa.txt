 janmapatri main dwadash bhaavon ko kis prakaar ankit kiya jaataa he, yah jaanane ke liye prastut koshthak drashtavy hai
 The imagery of expressions in both Hindu and Greek systems is similar but the distinction between 6, 11 and 12 expressions is clear
 yadhyapi hindu pranali main jhuthe bhav sa shatru or rog donon kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he kintu unamem shatru bhav hi mukhya he
 Greek astrology has eleventh friend sentiment and twelfth trinity
 hindu jyotish main 11vaan aay or barahawaan vyay he
 Other imaginations regarding the planets in the horoscope are based on the mutual relationships of the zodiac and other possible situations by which the symbols presented are consistent with actions occurring on the creatures
 grahon kii swaabhaavik maitri, virodh or tatasthta tathaa taatkaalik vidwesh, sauhardra or sambhaav kii manyataayen janmkundali ke liye aadharshila ke rup main gruhit hai
 Similarly, the seven planets like Sun, soul, mind, power, speech, knowledge, work, grief, and Aries, respectively, are in the order of twelve zodiac signs like Shir, Mukh, Ur heart, Udar, Kati, Vasti, Linga, Uru, Knees, thighs and feet etc
 have been conceived to describe the mental state and physical deformity, signs, etc
 of the creatures
 grahon ke shwet aadi varna, brahman aadi jati, saumy, krur, aadi prakruti kii manyataayen bhi pranivarg ke rup, rang, jati or manovriti ke parichay ke liye hi hai
 Their successful use is well known for the knowledge of stolen goods
 praaniyon ke samast jeevankaal ke bhinn-bhinn avyav bhinn-bhinn roopon main prabhavit batalaanevaale grahon kii dashaon or antardashaon ke parinaam hai
 Which time in life will be pleasing and which will be unpleasant, when will be destiny, when will the happiness of mother, father, brothers, offspring, women etc
, when will marriage happen, which planet will bring prosperity in life and which planet In the state of time, we will have to dig at every rate, most of all at which time you will have to leave this world forever, etc
 All things are communicated only by the planets' conditions and intuitions
 grah dasha kii gananaa ke liye janmakalasambandhi chandramaa kaa nakshatra pradhan he
 Calculated from the Kritika, the positions of the Sun, Moon, Bhum, Rahu, Guru, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu and Venus respectively in the nine Nakshatras are of the order of 6,10,7,18,16 19,17,7,20 years respectively
 Has been considered as 120 years
 is prakaar krittika se janmakalik chandramaa ke nakshatra tak kii sankhya main 9 kaa bhaag dekar shesh sankhya jis grah kii hogi usee kii dasha janmkaal main maani jaaegi tathaa janm samay or nakshatra ke panchangeey bhoga kaal se grah kii dasha ke janm kaal se pehle vyateet or janm ke baad ke bhoga kaal kaa nirnay karke bhavi faladesh ko prastut kiya jaataa he
 If the planet is in its own house or friend's house in the horoscope or is high, the house of the house it will be in, its fruit will be good and if it is located in the house of the enemy or in the low zodiac sign, it will be bad
 ab prashn uthta he ki sabhi gananaayen to ashvini nakshatra se aarambh kii jaati hai
 Then why planetary mood is calculated from Kritika
 tathy yah he ki hamaara grahadshasambandhi faladesh tab se chalaa aata he jab hamaari nakshatra gananaa krittika se aarambh hoti thi
 Maharishi Garg mentions two independent Nakshatra enumerations in the Vedic period - one Kritikadi and the other Dhanishtadi
 garg vaakya he ki- teshan sarveshan nakshatrana karmsu krittika prathammachachakshate shravishthatu sankhyayaa: purva lagnanam arthath sabhi nakshatron main agnyadhan aadi karmon main krittika kii gananaa pratham kahi jaati he kintu dhanishtha kshitij main laganevaale nakshatron main pratham he
 The secret is that at the time when the Tarapanja of Kritika was in the equator, Kritikadi Nakshatra calculation started
 jab uttarayan kaa aarambh dhanishtha par hota tha dhanishthadi gananaa kaa aarambh hua
 It is written in the Taittiriya Brahmana that Mukhna va etanakshananam yatakrittika etah va orienti diyo na chyvante i
e
 kritika is the first of all the nakshatras
 yah udai kaal main purv disha se nahin hatati
 It is certain that the planet or constellation that is in the equinox is the same rises everywhere on the earth plane in the east
 krittika kii akashiya sthiti ke anusaar gananaa karne par yah samay lagbhag 5100 varsh purv kaa siddh hota he
 Therefore, our planet's planetary system is so ancient
 hamaari janmkundali kii dasha antardashaon ke kram se prabhavit hokar arab deshavaasiyon ne varshafal kii ek nai pranali prarambh kii jise 'tajik' kehete hai
 In this, by taking the lagna of the time of completion of the solar year from the time of birth of the creature, it is considered to be auspicious within a year
 isamen 16 yogon kii pradhanta he jinamein laabh, haani tathaa shaareerik sthiti kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he
 The names of these 16 yogas are in Arabic language, some have been changed according to their names in Sanskrit texts, such as Iqbal Ashraf, Ittasal etc
 vartmaan samay main raashichakr ke baarah bhaag kar janmkundali ke faladesh kii jo pranali prachlit he iskaa ullekh bhaar ke pracheen vaidic sahitya main nahin he
 But Atharva astrology has long since contained the basic elements of this method
 isamen raashichakr ke 27 nakshatron ke nau bhaag karke teen-teen nakshatron kaa ek-ek bhaag mana gaya he
 Among them, the first 'janma Nakshatra', the tenth 'karma Nakshatra' and the nineteenth 'adhan Nakshatra' are considered
 shesh ko kram se sampat, vipat, kshemya, pratvar, sadhak, naidhan, maitra or param maitra mana gaya he, jaise- Among these, Janma, Sampat and Naidhan i
e
 1, 2 and 7, meet the 1st, 2nd and 8th places of the Dwadavaswali horoscope
 atharv jyotish main dasavaan karm nakshatra he
 Even in the modern system, the tenth place is karma
 isse siddh he ki atharv jyotish main nau sthaan vartmaan kundali ke baarah sthanon ke kisi na kisi sthaan main antarbhukt ho jate hai jo mesh aadi sangyaaon ke prachaar main ane ke pehle hi se hamaari faladesh paddati main vidyaman the
 The description of the constellations falling in the east horizon as lagna nakshatra is also described in 3300 year old Vedang astrology
 jaise,- shravishthabhyo gunabhyastan pragvilagnan vinirdishend
 That is, after counting the property three, the constellations in the horizon before the close should be told
 isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki us samay 27 nakshatron main teen teen bhaag karke nakshatra chakra ke nav bhaag kiye gaye the
 The new departments of Atharva astrology harmonize with this
 europea vidwaanon kaa mat he ki nakshatra chakra ke baarah bhaag yaa baarah rashiyaan bharat main baahar se ai
 But in our Vedic literature, twelve parts of the constellation cycle based on the movement of the Sun and 27 parts based on the daily movement of the Moon have already been done
 yadhyapi hamaare puraanon main jis prakaar nakshatron or chandramaa se sambandhit kathaayen hai, usee prakar meshadi raashiyon kii kathaayen nahin hai kintu greek sahitya main hai
 Even then, it is not proven that the zodiac calculation and sentiment came from outside India
 europea vidwaanon kii hi uktiyaan iske vipareet sakshya de rahi hai
 Jacobi states that in the horoscope, the method of giving fruits from the twelfth houses is found in the book of Pharimicus Maternus
 yahan yah bhi gyatavya he ki tolemi se pehle greece main bhi kisi jataka granth kaa pataa nahin lagata
 The two Jataka texts of Ptolemy are called Almijasti and Titrabiblas but this is not authenticated
 yadi 354 i
 ke baad formikas matternas ke granth kaa prachaar bharat main hua satya maan liya jaay to varahamihir ke purv 250 varshon main 6 arya granthkaar or paanch aarsh granthkaaron kaa hona sambhav nahin prathit hota
 Varahamihira has named his predecessors Maya Yavan, Manittattha, Satya, Vishnugupta etc
 brihajjatak ke tikaakar bhattotpal kaa mat he ki ye vishnugupt chandramaa ke mantri acharya chanakya hai
 In this way, our zodiac calculation method is proved 300 years before AD
 isse yah kathan tathypurna nahin he ki rashigananaa bharat main baahar se ai
 In Brihatsamhita's Grahacharaadhyay, there are visible fruits
 usamen pratham sthaan chandra kaa he
 'mandavya' is mentioned in that chapter
 mandavy aarsh granthkaar hai
 In the Mandavya text, Chandrakundali was the main one or it was considered from the location of the moon
 yah vichaar atharv jyaatish ke 9 sthanon se hota tha
 After 10 zodiacs came into the publicity, it started to be considered with 12 expressions
 at: janmkundali kii paddati garg aadi kisi rishi ne prachlit kii, yah maananaa hi yuktisangat he
 Because in the specific theory existing 500 years before the year, there is an imagery of ascendant and emotions
 bhartiya jyotish main kuch raashiyon or greek naam is baat ke pramaan hai ki unaniyon se hamaara pracheen-sampark tha
 He also exchanged many disciplines and arts
 varahamihir ne likhaa he ki- It should not be concluded from this that all our Jataka Shastra is borrowed
 bhartiya janmkundali kii paddati jaanakar unaniyon ne uskaa vistaar avashya kiya or naveen rup main use varahamihir ke samay main bharatiyon ke sammukh prastut kiya
 As a result, Varahamihira also named the names of zodiac signs along with their new methods like Hora, Dreshanka, such as our algebra today spread across Europe by Arabs and returned to India in its own form and became known as New Mathematics
 jis tarah akaash mandal main baarah rashiyaan hai, vaise hi vartmaan samay main kundali main baarah bhav hote hai
 In the horoscope or Janmang Chakra, the sky is the sky map of what the position of the sky was at that birth place during one's birth

 a comet is a solar system that consists of small blocks made of stone, dust, ice and gas
 yah graho ke samaan surya kii parikrama karte he
 Comets with short paths complete the orbit of the Sun in an elliptical path in about 6 to 200 years
 kuch dhoomaketu kaa path valayakaar hota he or wo maatr ek baar hi dikhaai dete he
 Comets with long paths take thousands of years to orbit one
 adhiktar dhoomaketu barf, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia tathaa anya padaarth jaise silicket or carbonic mishran ke bane hote he
 a comet has three main parts - naabhi dhoomaketu kaa kendra hota he jo pathar or barf kaa bana hota he
 a cloud of gas and dissolves around the navel is called a coma
 naabhi tathaa coma se nikalne vaali gas or dhul ek poonch kaa aakaar le leti he
 When the comet comes closer to the Sun, the umbilical gases evaporate due to the effect of solar radiation
 isse coma kaa aakaar badhkar karodon mile tak ho jaataa he
 The gas and dissolves from the coma takes the shape of a long question
 saura-hawa ke kaaran yah puch surya se ulti disha main hoti he
 As the comet approaches the Sun, the tail size increases
 dhoomaketu ke bhautik gun neeche sarini main diya gaya he - The comet is classified on the basis of its orbit
 The orbits of comets with short orbits are smaller than 200 years, while the orbits of long-sighted comets are under the Sun's gravity, despite being very long
 Due to the solo orbiting orbit of parabola, such comets once circled the sun and went out of the solar system forever
 The orbit of the Anke Comet with smaller orbit lies between the Sun and the Guru
 It is believed that smokers with short orbit originate in the Kuiper belt, while long-haul axes originate in the Oort cloud
 It is believed that comets hold a long orbit when the Sun passes near a star orbiting the galaxy, or when the Sun's possible companion star, Nemesis or Planet X, comes close to it
 kam dravyaman or andakaar kaksha ke kaaran dhoomaketu kabhi kabhi bade grahon kii taraf aakarshith hote he or isse uski kaksha par asar padataa he | choti kaksha vaale dhumaketuon kaa ek centre bade grahon kii kaksha ke andar sthit hota he | yah spasht he ki urt badal se aane vaale dhumaketuon kii kaksha par bade grahon kaa asar padataa he | badi sankhya main aise dhumaketuon par vishesh rup se brihaspati kaa asar padataa he jiskaa dravyaman soramandal ke anya sabhi grahon ke dravyaman se bhi zyada he | Sometimes the previously discovered comets are lost due to the effect on the orbit
 Sometimes it happens that after thorough study of the newly discovered comets, they are identified as missing comets
 11P / Temple - Swift - Linear Comet is an example of this
 He was first seen in 1869, after 1908 Jupiter's influence changed its orbit and it disappeared somewhere in space
 He was rediscovered in 2001 by a scientist named Linear

 Except for the hieroglyphs of the Indus Valley, Kharoshthi is one of the two oldest scripts in India
 yah daayen se baayein ko likhi jaati thi
 Emperor Ashoka has written the inscriptions of Shahbazgarhi and Mansehra in Kharoshthi script itself
 iske prachlan kii desh or kaalparak seemayen brahmi kii apeksha sankuchit raheen or bina kisi pratinidhi lipi ko janm die hi desh se iskaa lop bhi ho gaya
 The existence of another sophisticated script like Brahmi or the natural tendency to write from left to right of the country may have been the reason for the extinction of this script
 prarambh main iske padhane kaa prayaas karanevaale europea vidwaanon ne ise bactrean, indo-bactro-pali yaa ariuno-pali jaise naam die the
 The name Kharoshthi is in the list of 64 scripts mentioned in Lalitavistar
 iske naam kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main anek mat hai jinamein sarvaadhik maanya prajluski kaa he
 According to him, the basic of Kharoshthi is Kharpost

 In Mahamayuri, Kharposta is the name of a corporator from northwest India
 chini parampara ke anusaar iskaa avishkaar rishi kharoshth ne kiya tha
 Whatever the derivation of the name of the script, there is no doubt that in this country it came from the northwest and, for some time, except Ashoka, used only by foreign princes in their own sphere of influence, ended with them
 kharoshtee lipi ke udhaaharan prastarshilpon, dhaatunirmit patron, bhaandon, sikkon, murtiyon tathaa bhurjpatr aadi par uplabdh hue hai
 The earliest accounts of Kharoshthi have been found from Taxila and around Char, but its main area was North Western India and Eastern Afghanistan
 mathura se bhi kuch kharoshtee abhilekh praapt hue hai
 Apart from these, the letters or words written in Kharoshthi have also been found from Siddapur in South India, Ujjain and Mysore
 mukhya seemaa ke uttar evam uttar purvi pradeshon se bhi kharoshtee lekhonvaale sikke, murtiyan tathaa kharoshtee main likhe hue pracheen granth uplabdh hue hai
 BC From the fourth to the third century CE, Kharoshthi was prevalent in northwestern India up to Mathura
 kushanyug ke baad is lipi kaa bharat se baahar chini turkistan main pravesh hua or kam se kam ek shatabdi vah vahaan jivit rahi
 The most popular opinion regarding the emergence of Kharoshthi is that the Hakhamani rulers had to adopt the Armaei script used in Assuria and Babylon for governance purposes, and with its rule, it entered northwest India
 aavashyaktavash kuch bharatiyon ko ise siikhnaa padaa, kintu baad main brahmi ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par isamen parivartan hue or is prakaar kharoshtee kaa janm hua
 Its promotion mainly in the territory occupied by Iran of India, the use of ancient Persian scripts and the scriptural words derived from it in the records of Ashoka, the absence of ellipses, the existence of Kharoshthi letters with Brahmi letters on Iranian hurt coins and some of the Kharoshthi characters
 Equivalence with armae varna and the emergence of armae varna from many are nutrients of this belief

 Its characteristics and the cursive nature of varnas prove that it was the script of clerks and merchants etc
 But the manuscript obtained from Khotan written in Khoshasti also proves the existence of a second sophisticated form, which was used in the writing of scriptures

 On this occasion, Bhat sings a Trajan-war-related song, and Odysseus starts to cry distracted
 raja usase rone kaa kaaran poochta he to odisius ko apana vaastavik parichay dena padataa he
 In the next three passages, everyone recounts his 10-year thrilling journey after the fall of Odysseytrae
 12wein anuwak main odiciamas fiaisia ke jaadui jahaaj par ethaka pahunchataa he jahaan ethina ek gaderiye ke rup main usase milti he or use bhikhaari ke rup main parivartit kar detii he taaki uski patni ke panigrahanarthi use pahachaanakar koi haani na pahunchaa saken
 In the 13th verse, Athena dispatches Odysseus to his suitor and goes to Sparta himself, and orders Telemacus to return to Ithaca quickly
 14wein anuvaak main odisius tathaa shookarpal kii baatcheet he
 In the 15th episode, Telemacus escapes the conspiracy of his mother's entreaties and returns home safely
 16wein anuvaak main telemacas shookarpal ke ghar main apane pita ko pahchaan letaa he
 Later, the father plans to get rid of Pinelupi's diacritics
 17wein tathaa 18wein anuvaak main bhikshukveshi odisius apane prasaad main pahunchataa he jahaan uskaa purana kutta ergas use pahachaanakar khushi ke maare dam tod detaa he
 At the same time, Odysseus sees the rationale of Pinlopi's attendants in the palace, which also makes the proper role of his terrible act of killing them later
 19wein anuvaak main odisia tathaa pinalopi kii aamane saamne baatcheet hoti he parantu pinalopi apane pati ko pahchaan nahin paati, jabaki uski puraani dhai uriclia uske pair main bachapan main bane kshatchihn ko dekhakar use pahchaan jaati he
 In the 20th verse, Odysseus wakes up overnight thinking of many things due to anger
 21 wein anuvaak main pinalopi apane panigrahanarthiyon ko chunauti detii he ki ve sab pari pari odisius ke dhanush kaa chilla chadhaakar is tarah tir chalaaen ki vah vishaal vriksh main tange 12 chhallon ke bich se nikal jaae
 All fail, but the beggar Odysseus shoots arrows from between the rings
 22 wein anuvaak main mahakavy kaa charmotkarsh he
 Odysseus kills all of Pinloopy's diacritics with arrows
 koi bhi ek, bachakar nikal nahin paata, kyonki vishaal kaksh ke sabhi daravaajein pehle hi band kar die gaye the 23wein anuvaak main pinalopi apane pati ko pahachaanati he or donon ke milan kaa hridaygrahi evam marmasparshi drishy saamne aata he
 In the last or 24th chapter of the Maha Kavya, which some critics consider to be a projectile, the angel Mercury carries the souls of all the descendants of Pinloopy to the lower and infested regions of hell where they are given various kinds of tragic punishments
 isi bich odisius nagar ke baahar kheton main jaakar apane pita larties se miltaa he
 Finally, there is a grand feast to commemorate Odysseus's return home and the script concludes with information that ithaka is established
 elliod kaa kathanak mahaj 50 dinon kaa he - dasven varsh ke antim do maas ke andar kii ghati ghatnaayen
 If the plot had started from the beginning of the story, it should have started with the coincidence of Lida and Hans
 par homer katha ke antim bhaag ko pakadta he
 In between, he refers to the earlier story, not even in a sequence
 greek shrotasmaj ko katha pehle hi se gyaat he
 With this he does not know any difficulty, otherwise the first part of the story will be clear to an unknown person only once he recites the entire poem
 iliyat ke bare main duusari baat yah dhyaan main rakhane kii he ki uskaa vishay jaisaa ki mangalacharan se spasht he, ekiles ke krodh kaa gaan he
 Where this anger ends after its peak
 usase kuch aage tak, arthath is krodh ke pratyaksh fal petraclus kii mrityu evam apratyaksh fal hectares kii mrityu tak, chalakar katha samaapt ho jaati he par ekiles kii mrityu, try kaa dhwans aadi is mahakavy main nahin aate hai
 Homer keeps 'too The Point' very strictly on the theme declared in his epic - not a little bit
 is ghor sanyam kaa hi parinaam he katha-yaa ‘vishay kii ekta’ 
 Each event is seated within the entire design with tightly related associations
 bhartiya mahakavyon main isi ekta evam sangati kaa abhaav he evam sara dhaanchaa dhili-dhaali katha vyavastha se purna he
 The subject of Valmiki's Ramayana is Polastyavadh, but the events involved in it are connected with very loose sources
 mahabharat main to yah ‘ekta’ bilkul nahin - vah to vishwakosh kii style main likhaa gaya he
 In Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas, it is definitely like 'jatiili Ekta' and 'associative consistency' like Homer
 jahaan tak vishay kii ekta evam prabhavanviti kaa prashn he tulsidas kii samta koi bhi bhartiya kavi, chaahe vah kalidas hi kyon na ho, nahin kar saktaa
 This thing is being written here in Abhidhartha
 homer ekiles ke krodh evam uske vikaas kaa pratifal evam varnan 9 sargon main karata he or katha ko uske pratyaksh, apratyaksh falon tak le jaakar samaapt karata he
 If he had been tempted to narrate further events, till the death of the Achilles and the ruin, then there would not have been a strong structural unity in poetry
 dhaanchaa dhilaa ho jaataa
 Aristotle praised Homer's genius in those chapters of 'poetics' and taught Homer to emulate his ideal, where he discusses the 'three Unities' and influences
 greek sahitya main dhaanchaa par bahut hi adhik jor diya gaya he
 This form is evident in the geometric consistency of the law, their sculpture, theatrical etc
 unhone chand ko bhavanubhuti evam alankaar se kam mahatva nahin diya
 This trend is not only present in Homer, but in Homer itself
 elliod main sara ‘acshan’ vrittakar he
 Where it starts, it comes and ends there
 jin sanskaron ne greek tragedy ko dhaanchaa evam bhavbhumi pradaan kii, ve sanskaar greekon kii jaateey nidhi hai or ve hi homer kii pratibha main bhi praan sthaapan karte hai
 From this there is a structural and emotional similarity in the tragedy literature of Homer and Kalantar
 greek tragedy ke dhaanche kaa sanyaman teen tatva - ‘ek desh’, ‘ek kaal’, evam ‘ek vyapaar yaa vishay’-karte hai
 In the Iliad, the 'country' is the same, that is, the whole event takes place on the palaces of Troy and the beach in front
 ‘kaal’ bhi ek hi he, kyonki mahakavy kaa ghatnasutra lagaataar 50 din kii avadhi kaa he
 That is, a continuous unbroken form of 'kaal' is given - by holding the last 50 days of the 10th year
 kavyavrutt ko 10 varshon kii sataha par na failaakar vah 50 dinon ke andar hi samet letaa he
 The trade or subject is also the same - the anger of Echiles, its mitigation and its fruit in the form of epilogue
 bas, yaheen mahakavy samaapt ho jaataa he
 The subject of Odyssey is broad
 mahakavy kaa nayak odesius try yuddh ke baad 10 varsh tak bhatakta rahaa
 This epic also begins with the last part of this decade
 dhaanchaa thik elliod jaisaa he
 In the 50-day event of the Iliad, the present is the predominance - the purpose of the poet is to describe what happened in those 50 days
 purv kii ghatnaayen raah chalati charchaa-si kahin-kahin aa jaati hai
 But this is not the case in Odessa
 odesi kaa vishay hi he ‘odesius kaa dukhamay bhraman’
 Therefore, this is the aim of this 10-year tour
 vah elliod kii tarah hi dashak ke antim chor par prarambh hota he avashya, parantu uskaa uddeshy ‘vartmaan’ se adhik ‘ateet’ se sambandhit he
 Homer therefore uses flashback-technics of modern films
 mahakavy kaa armbh hota he 10wein varsh main, jab odesius apsara kelipso ke dweep se yatra shuru karata he or uskaa bhagn pot dub jaataa he evam vah nasika ke desh main bahakar lag jaataa he
 The king of there narrates the Ram story of his 9 years in canto from 9 to 12
 ‘purv-smriti’ takanic isi 9wein se 12wein sargon main he
 But even in the womb of this former memory, there is the 'antecedent memory' in the 11th canto, when he narrates the balance of the story of the war of triumphs to Aciles
 odesi kaa kaal sanghathan bada hi pechida he
 In the womb of 'present', 'east' and in the womb of that East lies 'ante'
 samooche kaal-bandh ko ‘mukul-patr-bandh’ kii sangya di ja sakati he
 In the bud, there is a second layer inside a layer of petals, a third layer lies inside the second
 usee bhanti odesi kaa kaal-bandh he
 This time-bound duality becomes complicated because the 'country' of Odyssey is not one
 odesi kaa vishay he, ‘bhayankar samudr-bhraman evam guhaagaman’
 Hence, the centers of trade become two
 ek to he ithaika jahaan uski rani pinilopi uski pratiksha main baithi he or uske putr-kaltr uske shatruon se ghire hai
 The second is Odessa's own and its floating position on the sea surface
 in do ‘deshon’ ke ghatnaon sanchaalan hota he mahaan sutaradhar zeeyas dwaara
 Even if there is no 'unity of the country', the unity of the subject or business exists in the same truncated way as in the 'iliad'
 kavi badi saavdhaanee se ek ghatana kii parat main duusari ghatana rakhkar samooche vyapaar kii sangati evam sudaulata kii raksha badi dhirta se karata he
 The content of the Iliad is limited
 isi se tragedy kaa pattern baith gaya
 Unity of work-effect was achieved very easily
 parantu ‘odesi’ kaa vishay vistrut he
 It is like a novel
 phir bhi itani saavdhaanee se kaary evam prabhaav kii ekta sampadit kii gayi he ki aaj ke style-pradhan yaa rup-pradhan upanyaas bhi uske saamne fike pad jate hai
 For a beginning poet - for a beginner, such a great workmanship is a matter of surprise
 sankshep main elliod kaa roopayan tragediparak he evam odesi kaa upanyasparak
 Despite this, Odyssey is parallel to the Iliad in many respects
 elliod or odesi donon kaavyon kaa armbh kathakaal kii antim chor pakadakar hota he
 The end of both is also on the subject declared in the beginning
 donon kii gati-rekha vrittakar he
 The number of cantos in both is 24
 elliod ke ant main hectares kaa nidhan he to odesi main paani-praarthi rajkumaron kaa
 At the end of the Iliad, a peaceful atmosphere, perfect for a period of time, is present in which both sides cremate the dead
 odesi main to ant main priyamilan evam sthaayee shaanti aa jaati he
 The characters in both the epics are known to be cast in the same scale and mold
 anthoni jis kutilata or tatparta se greek yoddhaon kii sahaayta elliod main karti he usee rup main odesi main bhi
 Poseidon is both a cruel and foolish deity
 odesius donon mahakavyon main saahsee, vir, krurkarma evam kutil rup main chitrit he
 Minilas is similarly rich, generous heart warrior in both epics
 budhimhan vruddh nestor kaa mitra bhi vahiin rahata he
 If the authors of these epics were different then there would have been a difference in the portrayal of the characters
 udhaaharan ke liye homer kaa ‘diomidil’ yaa ‘afroditi’ virgil ke diomedij yaa afroditi se bilkul alag hai
 The same pattern of plot and characters suggests that both poems are abandoned by the talent of the same person

 and have different classes of each of those branches, and by making many classes subclasses of those branches, they put big languages and their provincial distinctions, dialects and dialects

 There are many similarities in many dialects or dialects spoken near by; And on the basis of the same equanimity their classes or clans are established

 vikaas kii prakriya main bhashaa kaa dayera bhi badhata jaataa he
 Not only this, there is a substantial difference in the language of people speaking the same language in a society due to their different manner of speaking, their pronunciation process, word-store, syntax etc
 isi ko style kah sakate hai
 Thus, it is difficult to tell the fundamental difference between dialect, language and language, because the difference mainly depends on the expansion of the field of practice
 vaiyaktik vividhta ke chalate ek samaaj main chalane vaali ek hi bhashaa ke kai rup dikhaai dete hai
 We mainly look at these forms of language as follows- boli, Division, and bhashaa There is a difference between dialect and language

 Although the most significant changes in dialect came only after the Norman invasion of 1066, the language retained its name and the pre-norman dialect is now called Old English
 shuruyaat main puraani angreji vividh boliyon kaa ek samooh thi jo kii great britain ke anglo-sexn rajyon kii vividhta ko darshaati he
 One of these dialects, Late West Saxon, eventually succeeded in establishing its hegemony
 The original Old English language was again affected by two waves of invasion
 The first was by the language speakers of the North Germanic branch of the Germanic family; They conquered and colonized parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries
 The second was the 11th-century Normans, who spoke the old Norman language and developed an English variety of its anglo-norman salt
 in do hamalon ke kaaran angreji kuch had tak "mishrit" ho gayi 
 Cohabitation with the Scandinavians resulted in literal supplementation of the anglo-frisian core of the English language; The subsequent Norman occupation resulted in the beautification of the Germanic core of the language, incorporating many beautiful words from the Romance languages
 yah norman prabhaav mukhyatya adaalaton or sarkaar ke madhyam se angreji main pravisht ho gaya
 Thus, English developed as a "borrowed" language with flexibility and a large vocabulary
