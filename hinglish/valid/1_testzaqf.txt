 Chandrabhanu Gupta's political career began in 1926
 He was made a member of Uttar Pradesh Congress and All India Congress Committee
 Chandrabhanu had made his mark in the Congress in a very short time as soon as he entered politics
 He immediately became the Treasurer, Vice President and President of the UP Congress
 In the election of 1937, he was elected a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 Then in the first state government formed in 1946 after independence, he joined Govindballabh Pant's cabinet as Parliamentary Secretary
 He then worked as a minister of several departments from 1948 to 1959
 In 1960, he was made the Chief Minister of UP
 At that time, he was an MLA from Ranikhet South
 Politics had become very complicated when Sampurnanand was the Chief Minister
 Many factions were formed in the Congress
 In such a situation, Sampurnanand was made the Governor of Rajasthan and Chandrabhanu was the Chief Minister of UP
 Meanwhile, Gupta's stature had increased a lot in UP politics
 Becoming the Chief Minister was a landslide victory over all types of opposition
 This created panic among the leaders of the Center
 This was the period when the Congress people started challenging Nehru's power at the Center
 Chandrabhanu was not completely influenced by Nehru's socialism
 So Nehru did not like them
 But in the UP Congress, Chandrabhanu was so angry that the mlas were first bowed down in front of Chandrabhanu, and later in front of Nehru
 Nehru not like this In 1963, k Kamaraj advised Nehru that all Congress chief ministers, except a few people, should be designed
 So that state governments can be re-organized
 It was said that leave the post for a few days
 Have to work for the party
 But in Chandrabhanu's eyes, it was that all this game is happening so that the one whom Nehru does not like, he should leave
 They declined
 But they were convinced that it was a matter of a few days
 You will be made Chief Minister again
 But this did not happen
 Under the Kamaraj plan, Chandrabhanu had to step down on the dictum of ideals
 This was a very Democratic war of dictatorship over democracy
 The elected leader had to step down due to dislike
 Chandrabhanu was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh thrice
 From 1960 to 1963
 But even after leaving the post of Chief Minister, he remained an influence in politics
 a matter of luck
 He again became the Chief Minister after winning the 1967 election
 But this time for only 19 days
 Same luck again
 Farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh broke the Congress and formed his party
 Chandrabhanu's government went
 Charan Singh became Chief Minister
 But they could not run the government
 That government also fell
 And Chandrabhanu Gupta was re-appointed as Chief Minister in a hurry in 1969
 He remained in this position for almost a year
 Then something happened that changed the Congress forever
 The Congress party broke up in 1969
 This was not an internal issue of UP
 This time the breakdown took place at the center level
 In a syndicate group led by Indira Gandhi and Kamaraj
 Everyone thought that Indira would be a puppet in her hands
 But Indira turned out to be the biggest politician
 There was a dispute between the two factions about the President
 Morarji Desai turned out to be a strong opponent of Indira
 Chandrabhanu Gupta went to Morarji Camp
 But this camp lost
 VV Giri became President with the support of Indira
 It was here that the career of most of the leaders of the syndicate got a break
 Chandrabhanu's career ended
 But it's a matter of time Morarji also became Prime Minister
 Chandrabhanu was offered a position in the cabinet

 It was not appropriate to take the post of minister

 in vijayon se utsahit hokar ab usne bharat par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 His nobles and chieftains were not initially ready to attack a remote country like India, but when he declared his pious mission to destroy the idolatry prevalent in India for the propagation of Islam, his nobles and chieftains attacked India
 Agreed
 murtipuja kaa vidhwans to akraman kaa bahaanaa maatr tha
 In fact, he was attracted by India's gold
 bharat kii mahan samruddhi or vaibhav ke bare main usne bahut kuch baaten sun rakhi thim
 Therefore, to plunder India's wealth, he had planned an attack
 use akraman kaa bahaanaa foundne kii avashyaktaa bhi nahin mahasoos hui
 At that time the Tughluq Sultanate of Delhi was in a miserable state due to the weak successors of Ferozeshah
 bharat kii is raajnneetik durbalata ne taimur ko bharat par akraman karne kaa swayan suavasar pradaan diya
 In early 1398, Timur first sent one of his grandchildren, Pir Mohammed, to attack India
 usne multan par gheraa daalaa or chha: maheene baad usapar adhikaar kar liya
 In April 1398, Timur himself left for India from Samarkand with a heavy army and in September he crossed the Indus, Jhelum and Ravi
 13 oktober ko vah multan se 70 mile uttar-purab main sthit tulumba nagar pahunchaa
 He looted this city and killed many of its inhabitants and enslaved many
 phir multan or bhatner par kabja kiya
 There many temples of Hindus were destroyed
 bhatner se vah aage badha or maarg ke anek sthanon ko luutata-khasotata or nivaasiyon ko katl tathaa kaid karata hua disambar ke pratham saptaah ke ant main dilli ke nikat pahunch gaya
 Here he killed one lakh Hindu prisoners
 panipat ke paas nirbal tughlaq sultan mahmud ne 17 disambar ko 40,000 paidal 10,000 ashwarohi or 120 haathiyon kii ek vishaal sena lekar taimur kaa mukaabila kiya lekin buree tarah parajeet hua
 Frightened, Tughlaq Sultan Mahmud went towards Gujarat and his wazir Mallu Iqbal escaped and hid in Baran
 duusare din taimur ne dilli nagar main pravesh kiya
 For five days, the whole city was badly looted and its unfortunate inhabitants were slaughtered or imprisoned
 pidiyon se sanchit dilli kii daulat taimur lootakar samarkand le gaya
 Taimur also took many captive women and craftsmen with him
 bharat se jo karigar vah apane saath le gaya unase usne samarkand main anek imaaraten banavaain, jinamein sabase prasiddh uski swaniyojit jama masjid he
 Timur came to India only for plunder
 uski ichha bharat main rahakar rajya karne kii nahin thi
 So, after staying in Delhi for 15 days, he left for home
 9 janvari 1399 ko usne meerut par chadhaai kii or nagar ko lutaa tathaa nivaasiyon ko katl kiya
 He then reached Haridwar where he defeated two armies of the nearby Hindus
 shivalik pahadiyon se hokar vah 16 janvari ko kangra pahunchaa or usapar kabja kiya
 After this he marched on Jammu
 in sthanon ko bhi lutaa khasota gaya or vahaan ke asankhya nivaasiyon ko katl kiya gaya
 Thus, on 19 March 1399, after extensive damage to India's life, wealth and property, he again crossed the Indus River and returned to his country from Bharatbhoomi
 bharat se lautne ke baad taimur se san 1400 main anatolia par akraman kiya or 1402 main angora ke yuddh main automan turkon ko buree tarah se parajeet kiya
 He died in 1405 when he was planning to conquer China
 taimur langs doosraa changez khaan bananaa chahta tha
 He claimed to be a descendant of Genghis, but was in fact Turk
 vah langadaa tha, isliye 'taimur langs' kehalaata tha
 He became the ruler of Samarkand after his father in 1369 AD
 iske baad hi usne apni vijay or krurta kii yatra shuru kii
 He was a great soldier, but also a complete goth
 madhya asia ke mongol log is bich main musalmaan ho chuke the or taimur khud bhi musalmaan tha
 But when he was brought up by Muslims, he would not take softly with them
 jahaan-jahaan vah pahunchaa, usne tabaahi or bhalaa or puri musiibat failaa di
 He had great pleasure in getting huge piles of male and cisterns
 purv main dilli se lagaakar pashchim main asia-kochak tak usne lakhon aadmi qatl kar daale or unke kate siron ko stupon kii shakl main jamavaya
 In 1399, Taimur had a terrible attack on India
 apni jeevani 'tujuke taimuri' main vah quran kii is aayat se hi prarambh karata he 'i paigambar kafiron or vishwaas na laane waalon se yuddh karo or un par sakhti barto
 He further writes giving the reason for his invasion of India- kashmir kii seemaa par kator nami durg par akraman hua
 He ordered all men to be murdered and women and children imprisoned
 phir un hathi kafiron ke siron ke minar khadey karne ke aadesh diye
 Then the fort of Bhatner was surrounded
 vahaan ke rajputon ne kuch yuddh ke baad haar maan lee or unhen kshamaadaan de diya gaya
 But he was attacked as soon as he was indiscriminate
 taimur apni jeevani main likhata he ki 'thode hi samay main durg ke tamaam log talwaar ke ghat utaar diye gayi
 10,000 people were beheaded in an hour
 islam kii talwaar ne kafiron ke rakt main snaan kiya
 My soldiers, treasures and grain, which had been collected in the fort for years, were looted by my soldiers
 makaanon main aag laga kar raakh kar diya
 Buildings and fortifications were demolished
 doosraa nagar sarasuti tha jis par akraman hua
 'all Kafirs were Hindu slaughtered
 unke stri or bachche or sampatti hamaari ho gai
 When Timur entered the Jat region
 usne apni sena ko aadesh diya ki 'jo bhi mil jaye, katl kar diya jaye
 'and then whatever village or town came before the army, it was looted
 purushon ko katl kar diya gaya or kuch logon, striyon or bacchon ko bandi bana liya gaya
 ' dilli ke paas loni hindu nagar tha
 But some Muslims were also prisoners
 taimur ne aadesh diya ki musalamaanon ko chhodkar shesh sabhi hindu bandi islam kii talwaar ke ghat utaar diye jaayen
 By this time, the number of Hindu inmates had reached one lakh
 jab yamuna paar kar dilli par akraman kii taiyaari ho rahi thi uske saath ke amiron ne usase kaha ki in bandiyon ko camp main nahin choda ja saktaa or in islam ke shatruon ko swatantra kar dena bhi yuddh ke niyamon ke viruddh hoga
 Timur writes tughlaq badshaah ko haraakar taimur ne dilli main pravesh kiya
 He came to know that the Hindus have taken refuge in Delhi with their large number of women and children and valuable things while fleeing from the surrounding countryside
 usne apane sipaahiyon ko in hinduon ko unki sampatti samet pakad lene ke aadesh diye

 phontamilas larning tu da brid kii relies ke baad varsh 2000 se swissfoot ke saath yatraaen kar rahe hai

 Mostly associated with Christian rock, Switchfoot is often referred to as a "christian band"
 band hameshaa se darshanik rup se is label ke saath asahmat rahaa he: jon forman kehete hai, "hamaare liye yah ek aasthaa ke samaan he, style nahin"
 "ham hameshaa se apane gaanon kii utpatti ke bare main bahut hi khule or eemaandaar rahe hai
 Our songs are for everyone
 hamen 'chrishchiyan rock' kahana hamaare sangeet ko simit karne jaisaa he jo kuch logon kii pahunch se baahar ho

 Music has always opened my mind - and that's what we want "

 Foreman explains "there was something we wanted from the beginning"
 "when we connected with re-think Records, our aim was to make our music accessible to everyone
 jab spairo ne ri:think records ko kharida to yah spasht ho gaya ki hamaare sangeet kaa sabake paas tak pahunch paanaa sambhav nahin he
 As a Christian, i have a lot to say within the walls of the church

 X-rays or X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength is 10 to 0
01 nanometers
 yah chikitsa main nidaan ke liye sarvaadhik prayog kii jaati he
 It is a type of ionizing radiation, therefore dangerous

 The Röntgen equivalent human is its classical measuring unit
 germany main vurtsburg vishvavidhyalay ke bhautikee ke praadhyaapak wilhelm conrad rantjan ne 1895 main eksre kaa avishkaar kiya
 If the air from the glass tube is pumped out and electrified in a high voltage respectively, then the air starts to self-illuminate when the pressure is low enough
 is ghatana kaa praayogic adhyayan karte samay rantjan ne yah dekha ki vaayu kaa daab atyant alp hone par kaach kii nalika main se jo kirane aati hai, unase barium platinosynide ke manibh prakaash dene lagate hai or, nalika ko kaale kaagaj se purna rup se dhakne par bhi, paas main rakhe manibh dhyutimaan hote rahete hai
 Therefore, it was clear that the rays that come out of the esophagus can easily pass through the black paper and these rays have the special property of damaging the screen of barium platenocyanide
 vigyaan main is prakaar kii kirane tab tak gyaat nahin thim
 So these newly invented rays were named 'x-rays', but in honor of Rantzen, especially in Germany, these rays are called 'rantzen rays'
 rantjan ke avishkaar ke prakashit hote hi sampurna vaigyanik vishwa kaa dhyaan eksre kii ore aakrisht hua
 The x-ray property of crossing through opaque solids was extremely important and this property could be used in many departments of science
 at: anek bhautikee prayogshaalaon main eksre ke utpaadan tathaa unke gundharmo ke adhyayan ke praytn hone lage
 The study of electric immersion in air at low pressure has a special place in the development of modern physics
 yadi kaanch kii ek lambii nalika ko nirvaat pump se jodakar bheetar kii vaayu main ucch vibhav kii vidyudwara pravaahit kii jaae to prarambh main, jab daab adhik rahati he tab, koi kriya dikhaai nahin detii, kintu vaayu kii daab jab alp ho jaati he tab pehle donon vidyudagr dhyutimaan hote hai
 Lowering the pressure further reduces the entire tube
 aadhunik bhautikee kii vyakhya ke anusaar iskaa kaaran he ki jab electranon ko urja praapt hoti he or ve dhanagar kii ore ati veg se jate samay shesh vaayu ke anuon se sanghaat karte hai
 The ions of molecules are formed due to the collisions and when these ions get to the previous state then light is emitted
 yanon ke astitv ke kaaran vaayu main vidyudvisarjan jari rahata he
 When the pressure is too low, there are not enough molecules to collide with the electrons; Therefore, the electrons come out of the minuscule and collide directly with the material with all their energy
 in sanghaton ke kaaran electranon kii teevr urja dhanagar ke parmaanuon ko mil jaati he or iskaa ek parinaam eksre kaa utpaadan hota he
 This method requires a critical pressure in the tube to produce an x-ray
 vaayu kii daab yadi is kranthik daab se adhik ho to eksre ke utpaadan ke liye paryaapt urja electranon main nahin rahati 
 On the other hand, if the pressure is less than this critical pressure, electrons are not generated, so the electric discharge stops
 prarambh main eksre kaa utpaadan isi prakaar kii vayunalee kaa upyog karke kiya jaataa tha or vaayu kii daab ko mahatprayas se is kranthik daab ke maan par rakhaa jaataa tha
 Two special properties of X-rays are more important: tivrathamapan kii teen mukhya vidhiyaan hai
 The intensity of the fluorescence from the X-ray on the fluorescent screen — to the extent of the illumination — is proportional to the intensity of the X-ray
 pratidipti kii tivrata kaa anumaan karke eksre kii tivrata kii tulana sthool rup se ho sakati he
 In the second method, the action of X-ray above the photo palette is used
 eksre ke aapatan se photo pattica par jo kaalaapan aata he, vah eksre kii tivrata tathaa aapatan kaal par nirbhar rahata he
 This method allows the action of an X-ray of greater intensity to take place at the appropriate place on a photo plate with a higher intensity of the X-ray beam, and then the action of the second X-ray beam on the same plaque down t, 2t
 , 3t etc
 pattica ko viksit karne ke pashchaat donon chitron ke kaalepan kii tulana karne se donon punjon kii saapeksh tivrata kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 The third method of intensity measurement is more prevalent, because intensity can be measured precisely in this manner
 jab eksre vaayu main se jaati he tab vaayu vidyucchalak ho jaati he or uski chaalakata eksre kii tivrata par nirbhar rahati he
 The electrons of air molecules are displaced by the action of X-rays and ions are produced
 uchit vidyudvibhav kii upasthiti main yanon se jo vidyuddhara praapt hoti he, vah samvedi vidyunmapi se, athwa anya uchit samvedi upkarnon se, maapi ja sakati he
 The intensity of the x-ray is proportional to the electrode
 haal main gunak-prakashanalika or eksre-samvedi sphur ke upyog se tivrata kaa maapan atyant sulabh ho gaya he
 Similarly, the stream of ionization can also be easily measured with the help of a gelatinizer
 at: vartmaankaal main in donon prakaar ke upkarnon dwaara eksre kii tivrata kaa maapan adhik prachlit he
 These three popular methods of intensity measurement can only compare the intensities of the two x-ray elements, the absolute intensity cannot be achieved
 apati eksre ke lambavat ek varg centimetre kshetrafal par prati senkad jo urja padati he, usko vastut: ham us eksre kii tivrata kah sakate hai
 This intensity is expressed in ergs per square centimeter per second
 tivrata kaa maapan urja ke rup main karne ke liye eksre kii urja ko ushma atyant alp hone ke kaaran is reeti se tivrathamapan ke liye atyant sookshmagrahi vishisht upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In this manner, Terrill made the first attempt to intensify
 iske pashchaat 1953 i
 main america main ilinay vishvavidhyalay ke henderson, beati evam laafan ne bhi praytn kiye
 The intensity of the x-ray generated by very high current can only be measured in this way
 bhautikee ke praayogic kaaryo main sadaa ekakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or maapi gai raashi ke anusaar iskaa swaroop hota he
 The unit of X-ray quantity is called 'rantzen' and in the present tense the definition of a Rantzen is as follows- eksre kaa doosraa vishesh gundharm unki thos padaartho main praveshkshmata he
 The decrease in the intensity of the X-ray is not the same when the different solids are passed through the same mass
 kuch thos padaartho main eksre kaa avasorana adhik hota he ore kuch padaartho main kam
 The result of this experiment is that if the x-ray crosses the different mots of a particular solid, then the output x-ray is related to the intensity, initial intensity and thickness of the solid according to the following equation: log = – m × motaai --- Here = initial intensity of x-ray; i = thos padaarth main se paar hone ke pashchaat eksre kii tivrata; m = a constant, called the absorption multiplier
 is sthiraank ko us thos vishesh eksre-avasorana-gunak kehete hai
 In fact it is a linear multiplier
 isko vyapak rup main vyakt karne ke liye main us thos padaarth ke ghanatv kaa bhaag diya jaataa he or is prakaar praapt avasorana gunank ko 'sanhati-avasorana-gunank' kehete hai
 Therefore mmass = m / ghanatv The special significance of the Samhita-absorption-multiplier is that it is the characteristic property of the absorbing material
 udaahranarth, jal or bhaap kaa rekhiy avasorana-gunak bhinn hota he, kyonki jal drav he or bhaap gas hai
 But the x-ray code-absorption-coefficient of water and steam is the same, because the chemical preservatives of water and steam are integral, namely, hydrogen and oxygen
 prakaash or eksre ke gundharmo kii bhinnata sanhati-avasorana-gunak se atyant spasht ho jaati he
 Generally, liquids and solids are themselves opaque or translucent to light
 prakaash ke liye hira paardarshee or graphite apaardarshee he, parantu eksre kaa sanhati-avasorana-gunank hira tathaa graphite ke liye samaan hi rahata he, kyonki ye donon padaarth vastut: carbon ke hi vibhinn swaroop hai
 Absorption coefficients of the entire X-rays from the X-ray tube are mainly dependent on both the electrical current and the atomic number of the metal of the absorber screen
 jaise jaise vibhav badhata jaataa he vaise hi vaise utpaadit eksre kii praveshkshmata athwa kathorta badhati jaati he
 The equation leads to the conclusion that the absorption multiplier for a single solid will be constant for all the masses
 kintu pratyaksh prayog main eksre nalika se praapt vikiran kaa nune praveshkshamtawala bhaag avasorak parade ke pratham staron main hi purnataya avashoshit ho jaataa he 
 Only X-rays of high penetrability reach the final levels of the absorption screen
 spasht he ki avasorana parade main pravesh karanevaale eksre kaa avasorana gunank parade se paar nikle hue eksre ke avasorana gunak se adhik hota he
 When the absorption multiplier of all x-rays is the same, then they are called homogeneous x-rays
 at: eksre kii maatra unki tivrata se or unki visheshta unke avasorana-gunak se maapit hota he
 We can see the matter from which light comes, because light rays have an action on the design of our eye
 is prakaar kii kriya eksre dwaara nahin hoti, at: eksre drishy nahin hai
 Not only this, the action of each other on the eyes and other parts of the body is very harmful
 jivit koshaaon par eksre kii paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se ve mritt ho jaati hai
 X-rays easily cross through the skin and they are likely to die due to their long-term action on the living cells within
 phir, eksre ke prabhaav tikaoo hote he; at: sharir ke ek hi sthaan par bhinn-bhinn samayon par bhi eksre kii kriya hoti rahane par kuch kaal main cancer sadrush du:saadhy rog ho jate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to work very carefully while using X-ray
 sharir kii raksha ke liye vishesh saadhan upyog main laae jate hai
 In addition, current x-ray users keep an x-ray-measure in their pocket in the present tense, which shows how much radiation has worked on the employee
 eksre ke is ghaatak gundharm kaa anya rogon main upyog bhi kiya jaataa he; jaise, sharir ke kisi bhaag main anisht roganuon kii vruddhi hoti ho to unpar eksre kaa prayog karke unhen nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 X-rays are used more in medicine, especially in surgery
 is prakaar ke upyog kii sambhaavna eksre ke avishkaar ke samay se hi spasht thi
 Different elements of the body have different absorption-multipliers; Therefore, by taking an x-ray from any part of the body and taking a photo, the bones and other components are seen separately
 at: shalya kriya ke purv, athwa yah gyaat karne ke liye ki rog kis avasthaa main he eksre photo atyant upyogi hote hai
 As the production of X-rays progressed, they started to be used in industries as well, and in the present times the use of X-rays in metallurgy has become necessary
 urja yaa to kanon ke saath athwa tarangon ke saath sanyukt rahati he
 If energy is emitted from an origin, the existence of this energy is usually expressed in the intensity of electromagnetic waves, or as the kinetic energy of particles like electrons, protons, neutrons, ions etc
 tarang or kan ke swaroop bhinn hote hai; isliye inako saadhaarant: bhinn virgo main rakhaa jaataa he
 But it has become clear from the results of many experiments that the bonding of these classes has properties of particles in waves and, conversely, particles also have properties of waves
 is dwait rup kaa prarambh plank ke ushmavikiran ke siddhant se prarambh hua
 The properties of X-rays are also no exception to this dual form
 eksre ke katipay gun tarangon ke hai tathaa katipay gun kanon ke bhi hai
 First we will consider the wavelet properties

 But the first conclusive results came from experiments with Lave, Friederisch and Kniping, and the wavelength of X-rays was proved
 is prayog ke pashchaat eksre kii tarangaprakruti suspasht karne ke tathaa uske sambandh main anya parinaamon ke praayogic fal praapt karne ke tathaa uske sambandh main anya parimaanon ke praayogic fal praapt karne ke anek praytn hue
 As the x-ray wavelength is much less than the wavelength of light, there are many difficulties in using experiments for x-rays, by which the wavelength of light can be easily measured
 kintu vartmaan kaal main prakashako ke prayogon ke samaan eksre kaa vyatikaran, vivartan, dhruvan ityadi gun suspasht karne ke prayog safal hue hai or eksre ke tarangadairghy utani hi yarthathata se gyaat hue hai jitani se prakaashiya tarangon ke gyaat hue the
 Some of the experiments by which the x-ray waveform is proved are given below- eksre se manibh sanrachana jaanane main vishesh sahaayta milti he 
 Apart from medical uses, X-rays are also used in many ways
 eksre ke vishisht gunon ke kaaran unka upyog vistrut rup se vigyaan kii anek shakhaon tathaa vibhinn udyogon main hota aa rahaa he
 X-rays are used a lot in industries, especially in the construction and control of the properties of manufactured materials
 nirmit padaartho kii antasya trutiyaan eksre photographon dwaara saralata se gyaat kii ja sakati hai
 Aircraft and instruments of the same type of equipment have to withstand extremely high velocity and extreme physical conditions; In the manufacture of such instruments, every element must be innocent and accurate
 aise prayek avyav kii pariksha eksre se kii jaati he or sadosh avyavon kaa tyaag kiya jaataa he
 Metals absorb x-rays, so soft x-rays are unsuitable for examination of the metals' interfaces

 X-rays are very useful in metallurgy and metallurgy

 Each circle is of equal intensity, but due to the increase in the size of particles due to some physical activity, the points in these circles also come
 at: eksre vyabhang dwaara iskaa thik thik pataa chal jaataa he ki dhatviya manibhon ke kan kis prakaar ke hai or unka aakaar aadi kaisaa he
 This knowledge has great importance in metallurgy
 dhaatu ke padaarth banane ke samay ushma ke kaaran unamem antarvikruti aa jaati he
 Folding of a metal also causes it to become insoluble
 aisi vikrutiyon kaa vishleshan eksre se ho saktaa he
 Thus X-rays are of particular use in obtaining flawless metals with specific properties
 eksre ke anya upyogon main eksre sookshmdarshi ullekhneey he
 The wavelengths of X-rays are smaller than the wavelengths of light, so X-ray microscopes should be more effective than light microscopes
 1948 main eksre ko kendrit karne ke karkapetric ke praytn anshat: safal hue
 Efforts to magnify the image in this manner and other ways have now crossed the experimental stage and many types of X-ray microscopes manufactured by many manufacturers are accessible

 The Mahavayutpati dictionary of Pali is about to introduce about nine thousand verses in 285 chapters
 buddha sampradaay ke paribhaashik shabdon kaa arth dene ke saath-saath pashu pakshiyon, vanaspatiyon or rogon aadi ke paryaayon kaa isamen sangrah he
 It contains about 9000 words

 The second special important lexicon of Pali is Pradhan Pradipika

 The number of dictionaries available in Prakrit language is small
 jain bhandagaron se kuch praakrit or apbhransh ke koshon kii vidyamanata kaa pataa chalaa he
 Dhanapala Vritich 'paiyalchinamamala' is perhaps the earliest available dictionary of Prakrit
 inke gadhykavy 'tilkamanjari' ke ullekhanusaar 'munjaraj' ne inhe 'sanraswati' oopaadhi di thi
 This chapter, composed in Gathachand, specifies the verse in verse, synonyms in verse and verse and word
 'hemchandra' ne apane 'deshinammala' main isaki sahaayta kaa tikaa main ullekh kiya he
 Famous by the name Hemachandra, 'deshinamala' is said to be an important and famous dictionary of Prakrit
 desh shabd vastutah praakrit kaa paryaay nahin he, uski seemaa main praakrit or apbhransh kaa jo hemchandra ke samay tak ukt bhashaaon ke grantho main milte the unheen kaa sangrah he
 It is generally known from the native that words which were not derived from the Sanskrit corresponding words, were the extraneous words of the secular languages of the Tattat country, which have been called indigenous
 deshaj bhi unheen kaa parichaayak he
 But this is not the fact
 deshi, nammala ke bahut se shabd deshaj avashya he
 But the Sambhav words which are not etymologically associated with Sanskrit later words, have been considered as indescribable indigenous words
 praakrit ke vyakaran niyamon ke anusaar jinaki tadbhavasiddhi nahin dikhaai ja saki, unheen ko yahan deshi kahkar sankalit kiya gaya
 But the number of such words in 'deshinamala' is very large, which is a derived derivative of Sanskrit
 chunki praakrit vyakarnanusaar hemchandra unka sambandh, mul sanskrit shabdon se jodne main asamarth rahe atah unhen deshi kah diya
 As a result, we are able to say that the native word has so much meaning here that Hemachandra's grammatology was unable to relate the etymology of those words
 inke atirikt do deshi koshon kaa bhi ullekh milte he - ek sutnarup main or doosraa gopal krit chandobaddh
 The name of a native dictionary drawn is also found

 Hemachandra expressed his differences and opposition in the desi namamala with the said hairstyle

 Hemachandra, who has given the most importance to the lexicographers, is called the 'deshikosh' of Rahulak's composition and foot-lipcharya
 'jinratnankosh' main bhi anek madhyakaalin koshgrethon ke naam milte hai
 The Abhidhanchhimanimala is probably the same text called Hemachandra Vritchadhanchhichintamani and is a Sanskrit dictionary
