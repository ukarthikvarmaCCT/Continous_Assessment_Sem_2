 The animal or animal or animal is a main group of multicellular and concentric organisms of the world 'animelia' or Metazoa
 paidaa hone ke baad jaise-jaise koi praani bada hota he uski shaareerik yojana nirdhaarit rup se viksit hoti jaati he, haalanki kuch praani jivan main aage jaakar kaayantaran kii prakiya se guzarate hai
 Most animals are moving, that is, they can move on their own and independently
 zyaadaatar jantu parposhi bhi hote hai, arthath ve jeene ke liye duusare jantu par nirbhar rahete hai
 The maximum known animal phyla appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian eruption 542 million years ago
 shabd 'animal' latin bhashaa ke shabd animale, nauter of animalis, se aayaa he or anima se vyutpann hua he, jiskaa arth he jivit shwaas yaa aatma
 In common colloquial language, the term is used for non-human animals
 is shabd kii jaivik paribhaasha main maanav sahit kingdom animalya ke sabhi sadsy shaamil hai
 Animals have many special qualities that differentiate them from other living things
 jantu eukeriotic or bahu koshikeey hote hai,, jo unhen jeevanu va adhikansh protista se alag karte hai
 They are heterotrophic, usually digesting food in an inner chamber, which makes them distinct from plants and algae, they can also be differentiated from plants, algae and fungi because they lack a hard cell wall
 All animals are moving, even if they are in a particular phase of life
 adhiktam jantuon main, bhrun ek blastula avasthaa se hokar gujarata he, yah jantuon kaa ek vibhedak gun he
 With few exceptions, most notably sponges and placozoa, the bodies of animals differentiate into different tissues
 in main mansapeshiyaan shaamil hai, jo sankuchan tathaa gati ke niyantran main sakasham hoti hai or tantrika utak, jo sanket bhejtaa he va un par pratikriya karata he
 They also have a typical internal digestive chamber consisting of 1 or 2 holes
 jin jantuon main is prakaar kaa sanghathan hota he, unhen metazon kaha jaataa he, yaa tab eumetazon kaha jaataa he jab, purv kaa prayog saamaanya rup se jantuon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 All animals have eukaryotic cells, which are surrounded by extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoprotein
 yah khol, asthi or kantak jaisi sanranchanaaon ke nirmaan ke liye kelsikrut ho sakati hai
 During development, it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move and reorganize, creating possible complex structures
 iske vipareet, anya bahukoshikeey jeev jaise paudhe or kavak kii koshikaayen koshika bhitti se ghiri hoti hai or is prakaar se pragatisheel vruddhi dwaara viksit hoti hai
 In addition, animal cells have a unique property of intercellular joints: tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes
 lagbhag sabhi jantu kisi prakaar ke langik prajnan kii prakriya se hokar guzarate hai: poliploid
 These have some specialized reproductive cells that undergo meiosis to produce small motile spermatozoa or large sedentary eggs
 ye sangalit hokar yugmanaj banaate hai, jo viksit hokar nayaa jeev banaata he
 Many animals also have asexual reproductive capacity
 yah anishekajanan ke dwaara ho saktaa he, jahaan bina nishechan ke anda bhrun main viksit ho jaataa he, kuch maamalon main vikhandeekaran ke dwaara bhi aisa sambhav he
 The zygote initially develops into a hollow sphere called blastula, it undergoes a process of rearrangement and differentiation of cells
 spanj main, blastula larva tair kar ek nae sthaan par chalaa jaataa he or ek nae spanj main viksit ho jaataa he
 In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complex rearrangements
 yah pehle antar valayit hokar ek gestrula banaata he, jisamen ek pachan kaksh or do alag janan str hote hai-ek bahari bahyatvak str or ek aantarik antah tvak str
 Prey is a biological interaction in which a predator receives food from its prey
 shikari jeev apane shikaar jeev khaane se pehle maar bhi sakate hai or nahin bhi, lekin shikaar kii prakriya kaa parinaam hameshaa shikaar jeev kii mrityu hi hoti he
 Another major category of consumption is dead nutrition, consumption of dead organic matter
 kai baar in donon prakaaron ke khaadya vyavhaaron main vibhed karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye, paraseete prajati ek parposhi jeev kaa shikaar karti he or phir us par apane andey detii he, taaki unki santati iske apaghatit hote hue carbonic dravya se bhojan praapt kar sake
 The selective pressure exerted on one another has led to an evolutionary race between prey and predator, resulting in many anti-predator adaptations
 zyaadaatar jantu apratyaksh rup se surya ke prakaash se hi urja praapt karte hai
 Plants use this energy to convert sunlight into simple sugars using a process called photosynthesis
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya carbon dioxide or jal ke saath shuru hoti he, isamen surya ke prakaash kii urja ko rasinic urja main badal diya jaataa he, jo glucose ke bandhon main sanchit ho jaati he, is prakriya ke dauraan oxigen bhi mukt hoti he
 Now this sugars are used as manufacturing units, which leads to plant growth
 jab pashu in paudhon ko khate hai, paudhon ke dbaara utpann kii gayi sharkara jantuon ke dwaara kaam main le lee jaati he
 It either aids in the direct development of the animal or decomposes and is stored solar energy and thus the animal receives the energy required for movement
 yah prakriya glycolysis ke naam se jaani jaati he Animals that live close to water heat exhausts or cold seeps on the ocean floor are not dependent on the energy of the sun
 iske bajaay, rasayan sanshleshi jeev or jeevanu khaadya shrinkhalaa kaa aadhaar banaate hai
 ] aam manyata he ki jantu ek kashabhiki eukeriot se viksit hue hai
 Their closest known living relatives are the Coeno flagellum, the collard flagellum whose morphology is similar to the Coeno sites of specific sponges
 aanvik adhyayan jantuon ko ek param samooh main rakhata he, jise opisthokont kaha jaataa he, isamen bhi koeno kashabhiki, kavak or kuch chote paraseete protista ke jantu shaamil hai
 The first fossils that represent animals appeared around the end of the Precambrian period, about 610 million years ago and are called the Ediacaran or Vendian biota
 lekin inhen baad ke jeevashm se sambandhit karnaa kathin hai kuch aadhunik sanghon ke purvavartiyon kaa pratinidhitiv kar sakate hai, lekin ve alag samooh ho sakate hai or yah bhi sambhav he ki ve vastav main jantu na hon
 Except for them, the most known animal phyla appeared automatically during the Cambrian era, 542 million years ago
 yah abhi bhi vivaadit he, ki yah ghatana jise cambrian visphot kaha jaataa he, bhinn samoohon ke bich teevr vichlan kaa pratinidhitiv karti he yaa paristhitiyon main un parivartanon kaa pratinidhitiv karti he jisane jeevashmeekaran ko sambhav banaaya
 Although some archaeologists and geologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier than previously thought, probably 1 billion years ago
 Fossil insignia such as trails and burrows found in the Tonian era indicate the presence of three-dimensional worms such as metazoa
 Likely earthworms would have been large and complex
 iske alaava lagbhag 1 billian varsh purv tonian yug kii shuruyaat main, stromatolait main kami aayi
 The diversity that currently informs the arrival of animals grazing as stromatolites increased diversity, shortly after the end of the Ordovician and Permian, causing large numbers of grazing marine animals to become extinct in their populations
 Shortly after the recovery, their number decreased
 vah khoj jo in praarambhik jeevashm chinhon ke bahut adhik saamaan he, unki utpatti aaj ke vishaal aakar ke ek koshikeey protista ke jeev gromia sferica ke dwaara hui he, is par praarambhik jantu ke vikaas ke pramaan ke rup main unki vyakhya par andeh he
 For a long time, sponges were considered different from other early animals
 jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he, anya adhikansh sanghon main paaya jane vaala jatil sanghathan inamen nahin paaya jaataa he, unki koshikaayen vibhedit hai, lekin adhikansh maamalon main alag alag utakon main sangathit nahin hai
 The sponges are stems and usually draw water through their pores to obtain food
 aarkiokaitha, jisamen sangalit kankal hota he, vah spanj kaa yaa ek alag sangh kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he
 However, a Fellow genomic study of 150 genes in 21 species in 2008 suggests that it is Tinophora or comb jelly that forms the basis of animals in at least 21 of those associations
 lekhak vishwaas rakhte hai ki spanj yaa kam se kam ve spanj jo unhone khoje hai- itane aadim nahin hai, lekin iske bajaay dwitiyak rup se sarlikrut kiye ja sakate hai
 In other phyla, Tinophora and Nideria, including sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric, having a digestive chamber with a single pore, which serves both the mouth and the anus
 donon main spasht vibhedit utak hote hai, lekin ye angon main sangathit nahin hote hai
 There are only two main germ levels, ectoderm and endoderm, between which only the cells are scattered
 isi liye in jantuon ko kabhi kabhi diploblactic kaha jaataa he
 Small placozoa are similar, but do not have a permanent digestive chamber
 shesh jantu ek sangheey samooh banaate hai jo bailetria kehalaata he
 For the maximum part, they are bilateral symmetric and often have a specialized head consisting of food organs and sensory organs
 sharir tripaloblastic hota he, arthath, teenon janan paraten purna viksit hoti hai or utak vibhedit ang banaate hai
 The digestive chamber has two holes, a mouth and an anus, as well as an internal body cavity which is also called a celome or virtual body cavity
 in main prayek lakshan ke apwaad hai, haalaanki- vyask ekainodermet trigyat samamit hota he or vishisht paraseete jantuon main bahut hi sarlikrut shaareerik saranchana hoti he
 Genetic studies have changed our knowledge of relationships within the Bilateria to a great extent
 adhikansh do mukhya vanshawaliyon se sambandh rakhte hai: duterostome or protostome, jinamein shaamil hai ekadsojoa, platizoa or lophotrocojoa
 In addition to this, there are some small groups of bipartite asymmetrical organisms that appear to be diffusing to these main groups
 in main shaamil hai esolmorpha, rombojoa or orthonekatida
 Mixozoa, a unicellular parasite originally thought to be protozoan, are thought to have evolved from the Bilateria
 duterostome anya bailetria, protostome se kai prakaar se bhinn hai
 In both cases a complete digestive tract is found
 haalanki, protostome main praarambhik chhidr muh main viksit hota he or guda alag se viksit hoti he
 This is the reverse in deuterostomes
 adhikansh protostome main, koshikaayen saadhaaran rup se gestrula ke aantarik bhaag main bhar jaati hai or madhya janan str banaati hai, yah shaijosilas vikaas kehalaata he, lekin duterostome main yah antar janan str ke antervalan se banataa he, jise entrocelic pouching kaha jaataa he
 Deuterostomes have a dorsal nerve cord rather than a ventral and their embryos undergo a different cleavage
 yah sab vivaran bataata he ki duterostome or protostome alag ek sangheey str hai
 The major associations of deuterostomes are echinodermata and chordata
 pehle vaala trigyat samamit he or vishesh rup se samudri he, jaise tara machhlee, samudri archin or samudri khiraa
 The second one consists mainly of vertebrate organisms in which the spinal cord is found
 in main shaamil hai machhlee, ubhaychar, reptiles, pakshi or standhari
 Apart from these, deuterostomes also include Hemicordetta and Akon worms
 haalaanki ve vartmaan main mukhyatah nahin paae jate hai, mahatvapurn jeevashmi pramaan inase sambandh rakhte hai
 Chatognatha or arrow worms may also be deuterostomes, but more recent studies show their association with protostomes
 ekadsojoa protostome hai, jinka yah naam paritvakabhavan yaa nirmochan ke dwaara vruddhi ke vishesh lakshan ke aadhaar par diya gaya he
 The largest animal union, Arthropoda, belongs to them, including worms, spiders, crabs and their close relatives
 in sabhi main sharir khandon main vibhajit hota he or praroopik taur par inamen yugmit upang paae jate hai
 The two smaller phyla Onychophora and Tardigreda are closely related to Arthropoda and have similar traits
 ekadsojoa main nimetoda yaa gol krimi aate hai, yah doosraa sabase bada jantu sangh he
 Roundworms are usually micro-organisms and are produced in almost every environment where there is water
 kai mahatvapurn paraseete hai
 The smaller associations related to these are the Nematomorpha or Ashvarom worm and the Kinorhinka, Priapulida and Loricifera
 in samoohon kaa laghukrit dehguha hoti he, jo abhaasi deh guha kehalaati he
 The remaining two groups of protostomes are sometimes placed along the spiral, as embryonic development occurs in both with spiral cleavage
 platizoa main shaamil he sangh platihelminthij, chapate krimi
 Originally they were thought to be the most primitive types of bipartite, but they are now thought to have evolved from more complex ancestors
 is samooh main kai paraseete shaamil hai, jaise fluke or feeta krimi
 Flatworms are angular, lacking a body cavity, as in their closest relative, the microbe Gastrotrica
 platizoa ke anya sangh zyaadaatar sookshm darsheey or abhaasi dehguha se yukt hote hai
 The most prominent are rotifera or rotifers, which are common in aquatic environments
 inamen aconthociphela yaa shalki-sheersh vaale krimi shaamil hai, gnethostomulida, micrognethojoa or sambhawatah sicleophora
 These groups have complex jaws, due to which they are called Gnathifera
 donon hi samooh lambey arase se nikat sambandhi maane jate hai, kyonki donon main hi trocofor larva paaya jaataa he, lekin enelida ko aarthropoda ke adhik najadik mana jaataa tha
 Because they both fragment
 ise aam taur par sansruth vikaas mana jaataa he, kyonki donon sanghon ke bich kai aakaariki or anuvanshik bhed hai
 Lophotrochozoa also includes the Nemertia or Ribbon worm, Sipuncula, and several associations that have a fan of cilia around the mouth, called the lophophore
 inhen paaramparik rup se lopho forates ke saath samoohit kiya jaataa tha
 But now it appears that they are paraphyletic, some close to Nemertia and some close to Mollusca and Annelida
 inamen brekiopoda yaa lemp shell shaamil hai, jo jeevashm ricord main mukhya hai, ye hai antoneprokataa, foronida, ore sambhawatah bryojoa yaa mos jantu
 Due to the large diversity found in animals, it is more economical for scientists to study a small number of selected species, in order to correlate their work and findings on how animals normally function
 We do
 kyonki unhen rakhana ore unamem sankaran karana aasaan he, fal makkhi drosophila melanogaster, ore nimetode kenorehabditis eligens lambe samay se vyapak adhyayan kiye jane vaale namoonay ke jeev rahen hai or pehle jivan roopon main se the jinhen anuvanshik rup se anukramit kiya gaya
 This was facilitated by the much more reduced state of their genome, but here the two-edged sword with multiple genes, introns, and linkage lost, organisms of Ecdysozoa can teach us a little bit about the origin of animals in general

 Analysis of the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmella suggests that the last common ancestor of sponges and the animals of Eumetazoa were more complex than previously imagined
 jantu jagat se sambandh rakhane vaale anya modal jeevon main shaamil hai chuha or zebrafish 
 Aristotle divided the living world into plants and animals, and was followed by Carolus Linnaeus, the first hierarchical classification
 tabhi se jeev vaigyanik vikaas ke sambandhon par jor de rahe hai or isiilie ye samooh kuch had tak pratibandhit ho gaye hai
 For example, microscopic protozoa were originally thought to be animals because they move, but are now kept separate

 'engineering' and 'engineer' originated from the French words Ingénierie and ingenieur
 ye shabd puraani french ke 'engigneor' se vyutpann hai jiskaa arth 'yuddh-mashin kaa nirmaataa'
 Although the words 'engineering' and 'engineer' in English are similar to French words in pronunciation, they originated from a completely different source
 itnaa hi nahin, inaki vyutpatti 'ingine' shabd se nahin hui he 
 The English word synonym for 'engineering' is "engineering", which derives from the Latin word "ingenium"; It means 'natural mastery'
 nikat bhootkaal main abhiyantriki shabd kaa jo arth kosh main miltaa tha vah sankshep main is prakaar bataaya ja saktaa he ki But this limited definition could no longer run
 abhiyantriki shabd kaa arth ab ek ore nabhikeey abhiyantriki ke ucch vaigyanik or pravidhik kshetra se lekar maanviya gunon se sambandhit vishyon, jaise shramik niyantran prabandheey kaaryakshmata, samay or gati kaa adhyayan ityadi, anek praayogic vigyaanon ke vistrut kshetra ko ghere hue he
 Thus it would be more appropriate to define engineering as "it is the science and art of efficient use of natural means for the physical service of man"

 In such a situation, the engineer resorts to experimental analysis to some extent and finds a solution that can work in a way that, while properly managing the defense, can make his daily problems solvable
 jais-jaise sambandhit vaigyanik ansh kaa uskaa gyaan achook hota jaataa he, vah raksha ke prabandh main kami karke vyay bhi gata saktaa he
 The intellectual and functional consideration of the problems has also enabled the engineer to enter into those fields which are believed to be concerned with scientist, doctor, economist, manager, humanistic science and art from the beginning

 He considers diverse options
 vah vikalpon ko takneekee, aarthik tathaa suraksha kii drushti se moolyankan karata he or jo sarvaadhik upyukt parinaam detaa he use chun liya jaataa he
 Engineer work is very challenging
 galat hal kaa parinaam bahut mahangaa yaa bahut khatarnaak bhi ho saktaa he
 That is why often an engineer tests and analyzes a solution before implementing it
 iske liye vah prototip, laghu-aakaar vaale yaa sarlikrut modelon kaa prayog, simulation, dhvamsi yaa adhwansi test tathaa fatig test aadi kaa sahaara letaa he
 Since the result of a wrong solution can be severe, the engineer uses the safety multiplier when adopting pre-fabricated solutions to minimize the possibility of side effects
 kintu suraksha-gunak jitna hi adhik hoga, hal utana hi mahangaa, bada, yaa kam daksh hoga
 Russia's innovation specialist Gennrich Altshuler concluded after studying a number of patents that small-scale engineering solutions are based on agreements, while in large-scale work the engineer chooses the solution that addresses the greatest difficulty of the problem

 Champu is a distinction of audio poetry, that is, mixed poetry of prose-verse is called Champu
 gadhy tathaa padya mishrit kavy ko "champu" kehete hai
 This mode of poetry has not been mentioned by the ancient masters of literature - Bhamah, Dandi, Vamana etc
 yon gadhy padyamay style kaa prayog vaidic sahitya, buddha jataka, jatakamala aadi ati pracheen sahitya main bhi miltaa he
 The beginning of the Champukavya tradition is derived from the Atharva Veda
 champoo naam ke prakrut kavy kii rachana dasvin shatee ke pehle nahin hui
 'nalchampu', composed by Trivikram Bhatt, which is an early tenth century work, is a famous example of Champu
 iske atirikt somdev suri dwaara rachit yashatilak, bhojraj krit champoo ramayana, kavi karnapuri krit anandavrindavan, gopal champoo, nilkantha champoo or champoo bharat dasvin se satrahavin shatee tak ke udhaaharan hai
 This poetic form could not become more popular nor did it get special recognition in poetry
 hindi main yashodhara ko champoo-kavy kaha jaataa he, kyonki usamen gadhy-padya donon kaa prayog hua he
 The proper division of this mixture of prose and verse seems to be that the description of affective subjects should be presented by verse and descriptive subjects should be presented by prose
 parantu champurchayitaaon ne is manovaigyanik vaishishty par vishesh dhyaan na dekar donon ke sanmishran main apni swatantra ichha tathaa vaiyaktik abhiruchi ko hi mahatv diya he
 The mixture of prose-poetry is ancient in Sanskrit literature, but the poetic style, the possessive noun of "champu", cannot be considered as ancient as the compositional mixture of prose-verse
 gadhy-padya kii mishrit rachana krishna yajurvedic samhitaon main uplabdh hoti he
 Pali natives also have the achievement of the storyline in prose and the original formulaic allusions in verse
 parantu kavyatatv se virahit hone ke kaaran inhen ham "champu" kaa drushtaant kisi prakaar nahin maan sakate
 The Prayagprashasti of Samudragupta composed by Harishan and the Buddhist poet Ayanshur Praneeth Jatakamala can be considered primitive forms of Champu, as in the first, the Digvijay of Samudragupta and 34 Jatakas in the second are described in elaborate prose verse taking shelter of pure poetic style
 prathit hota he ki champu gadhykavy kaa hi ek paribrihit rup he or isiliye gadhykavy ke suvarnyug ke ananthar navam shatee ke aasapaas is kavyarup kaa udai hua
 The first paradigm of Champu poetry is the Nalchampu of Trivikram Bhatt in which the characteristic of Champu springs up
 dakshin ke rashtrakutvanshi raja krishna ke pautra, raja jagatug or lakshmi ke putr, indraraj ke aashray main rahakar trivikram ne is ruchir champu kii rachana kii thi
 The coronation of Indraj was in the year 972 and due to his dependence, the poet also has the same time as the first half of the tenth century
 is champu ke saat uchhvaason main nal tathaa damayanti kii vikhyath pranaykatha kaa bada hi chamatkaari varnan kiya gaya he
 In poetry, the Prasad of Shubhasa Sambhava Shlasa is targeted everywhere
 jain kavi somprabhasuri kaa "yashastilak champu" dasham shatee ke madhyakaal kii kriti he 
 The philosopher Rashtrakutnaresh was the synagogue of the son of Krishna's feudatory Chalukya Arikeshri
 is champu main jain puraanon main prakhyat raja yashodhar kaa charitra vistaar ke saath varnit he
 In the last three abuses of Champu by presenting a detailed account of the principles of Jainism, the poet has sufficiently propagated these principles
 granth main us yug ke naanavidh dharmik, aarthik tathaa saamaajik vishyon kaa vivaran somprabhasuri kii vyapak tathaa bahumukhi vandushi kaa parichaayak he
 Many talented poets have demonstrated their talent by reciting the charitas of Rama and Krishna
 aise champu kaavyon main bhojraj kaa ramayana champu, anantbhatta kaa "bharat champu", shesh shrikrishna kaa "parijataharan champu" kaaphi prasiddh hai
 Bhojraj had composed the Ramayana Champu till the Kishkindha scandal, which was completed by Lakshman Bhatt, "yudh Kand" and Venkatraj composed the "uttara Kanda"
 jain kaviyon ke samaan chaitanya mataavlambee vaishnav kaviyon na apane siddhanton ke pasar ke liye is lalit kavyamadhyam ko badi safalataa se apanaaya
 The theme of Lord Sri Krishna's Lalaam Leelas is such a beautiful occasion when these poets presented the offerings of their extraordinary talent to the devout readers through their champu poems
 kavi karnpur kaa anandavrindavan champu, tathaa jeev goswami kaa gopalchampu saras kavy kii drushti se nitant safal kavy hai
 The first of these poems gives a detailed and vivid description of Krishna's balalilas, the second verse is a poignant description of Krishna's entire character
 "virmitroday" ke prakhyat rachayita mitra mishra kaa "aanandakand champu" krishnaparak champuon main ek ruchir shrunkhlaa jodta he
 In South India too, Champukyas were not less popular

 Sri Vaishnava Venkatadhwari's "vishvagunadarsha Champu" is unique from other champs in that it has inaugurated the defects and virtues in many of India's numerous pilgrimages, religions and scribes together

 The "chitrachampu" of Vanishvara Vidyalankar is a composition of a typical Pandit poet of Bengal in which Bhakti's attainment by Bhakti is indicated through a succinct narrative in Rupakshali
 is prakaar sanskrit sahitya main bhaavon ke prakaton ke nimitt anek shatabdiyon tak lokapriy madhyam hone par bhi uttar bhartiya bhashasahitya main champu kavy drudhmul na ho sakaa
 Generally, in the literature of Dravidi language, especially in Kerala and Andhra literature, Champu poetry is popular even today, which attracts the attention of poets towards the practice
