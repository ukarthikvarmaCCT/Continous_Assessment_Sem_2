 ghoomane kii kshamta rakhanevaale teen urdhwadhar penchon par tiki kuen jaisi mani main padi ek dhuree par doorabeen is prakaar kasi rahati he ki mani ke centre par dhuree ke ghoomane se doorabeen se praapt drushtirekha kshaitij samtal main dhooma sake
 There are special differences between the normal telescope and the telescope
 iske netrika lens or abhidrishy lens ke bich main ek nae avyav, cross tantu, kaa tantupat daalkar drushtirekha nirdhaarit kar di jaati he
 In this way, the given line of stability is also called the Sandhaline
 is sandhanarekha kii kshaitijataa pramanit karne ke liye doorabeen ke saath ek pansal aise judaa rahata he ki uskaa aksh doorabeen kii drushtirekha ke samaantar rahata he
 Therefore, when vertical screws, also called horizontal screws, placed in the focal component of the device are smoothed and centered in a lateral bubble, the vision becomes horizontal due to parallel to the axis of the panel
 isse yah spasht ho jayega ki talamaapi main pansal or doorabeen sabase mahatvapurn avyav hai or doorabeen main tantupat, jo drushtirekha nirdhaarit karata he
 In establishing the horizontality of the vision, the design of the panal tube and the fluid inside it is more separable, and if it is displayed, then the device will not be useful for more realistic work
 kshaitijataa se parthaky ko pradarshit karne kii kshamta ko pansal kii sugrahyata kehete hai
 The bubble is not centered when the vision used for the actual work is slightly separated from the horizon
 sugrahyata or kshatijakaari penchon main aisa sambandh rakhaa jaataa he ki jis yantra main adhik sugrahya pansal lagaate hai usamen kshatijakaari penchon ke soot itane patale rahete hai ki pench ki ek chakkar ghoomane main yantra kaa utaar tha chadhaav bahut thodaa ho
 With only a slight movement of the screws from the fragile panasal and coarse yarn, the bubble runs here and there with great difficulty and the inept surveyor has great difficulty in concentrating it
 adhik yatharth kaary kaanewaale yantron main keval pansal hi adhik sugrahya nahin lagaate, varan bulbula kendrit hone main thodaa antar jise nangi aankhe nahin dekh saktin, use bhi dekhne kii kshamta paidaa karne ke liye ek upkaran laga hota he, jisase pansal ke bulbule ke donon siron ke aadhe aadhe aavarghit pratibimb ek prism main dikhaai dete hai
 When the bubble is not centered then the visible halves remain separate and when fully centered they form a regular curve
 doorabeen ke saath pansal or tantupat jodne main bhi aisi suvidha di rahati he ki yadi kisi prakaar drushtirekha or pansal ke aksh kaa samaantar rahane kaa sambandh bighad jaae, jise sandhan truti kehete hai, to uski pariksha or samanjan kiya ja saktaa he
 There is no theoretical distinction among all the above mentioned things, yet these instruments have been classified on two grounds: yantra ke yatharth kaary kaane kii kshamta ke aadhaar par tathaa Based on the facility provided for the examination of Sandhutruti
 pehle vargeekaran ke anusaar talamaapi teen virgon main baante gaye hai: According to the second classification, instruments can be divided into five classes: dampi talamaapi, y telemetry, utkramntic, talamaapi Cushing's, thermometer and avanami, talamaapi

 Its telescope is strongly attached to the vertical axis, allowing the telescope to neither spin on its longitudinal axis nor diverge from its axis

 It is a very soft device
 aangl bhashaa ke vaai akshar sadrush kursi par isaki doorabeen tiki rahati he or bandhon se kasi rahati he
 This allows the telescope to rotate on its longitudinal axis and open and reverse the ends

 isaki kursi dampi ke samaan drudh hoti he, jisamen doorabeen anudairdhya aksh par dhooma bhi sakati he or sire ulatakar bhi rakhi ja sakati he
 Its telescope is firmly stuck in the chair; Neither it can roam nor can it be lifted
 magar tantupat sahit uske upanetra netrika lens or abhidrishy lens kii sthitiyaan badali ja sakati hai
 The top part of the ophthalmic lens can also be applied by changing the top and bottom
 isse utkramntic talamaapi ke laabh banaae rakhkar yantra ko or bhi drudh bana diya jaataa he
 Its telescope is trapped by a horizontal axis from the chair at the mid-point, so that it is stuck slightly in the vertical plane, so that it can make a slight splash in the upward plane
 use sthir rakhane ke liye abhidrishy lens ke neeche ek sprag laga rahata he or netrika lens ek pench par tikaa rahata he
 By rotating the screw, the telescope rotates in the vertical plane on the horizontal axis, which causes the bubble to focus! sabhi prakaar ke talamaapiyon se prekshan karne se pehle kuch samanjan aavashyak hote he, jaise focus karnaa, visthapanabhas mitaanaa, kshaitijikaran ityadi hai
 The above adjustments, as the name suggests, must precede each observation
 tabhi yatharth kaary hoga
 The concentric line must be parallel to the panasal axis
 yah samanjan bhi aavashyak hone par kiya jaataa he
 But due to the tightness of the panasal and fibroblast binoculars, this adjustment is rarely done in the long term
 is kaaran ise sthai samanjan kehete hai
 These are the following: 1
 focus karnaa - doorabeen ke netrika lens ko aise ghumaate hai ki tantupat ke cross tantu spasht dikhaai dene lagen
 Thereafter, the focus screws on the telescope are rotated in such a way that the visible division of the measurement is clearly visible
 2
 sthapanabhas mitaanaa - netrika se doorabeen main vastu kaa pratibimb dekhte hue ankhen dhire dhire upar neeche chalaane se yadi pratibimb cross tantuo se hatataa dikhaai de to focus dhimi chaal se pun: aise ghumaate hai ki pratibimb cross tantu se bilkul hatataa na maaloom pade
 3 Horizontal - It is necessary to horizontalize the vision before taking the reading at the auditing yards
 iske liye prayek yantra main upaay diya rahata he, falat: uske samaantar drushti rekha, kshaitij ho jaati he
 Recently a telemetry has been invented which is automatic horizontalization
 talamaapi se pathan lete samay yah vishwaas kar liya jaataa he ki pansal kaa bulbula kendrit kar dene se drushtirekha kshaitij ho gai
 If this is the case, taking the reading from anywhere on the inscribed gauges placed at two points will indicate their relative height between the two points
 yadi aisa na ho, arthath sanghantruti ho, to yantra ke liye gaye pathnon main truti paidaa hogi
 Because the line of sight is not parallel to the axis of the pancreas, when the axis of the pancreas becomes horizontal, the line of sight will be removed from the horizontal plane
 yah hataav yantra kii duuri ke sidhe anupaat main badhata jayega
 Therefore, the measurements taken at unevenly spaced measurements will have uneven error
 unka antar sahi saapeksh oonchaai nahin batayega
 For this reason, if the instrument is placed in the middle of the measurements, both the reading will be equally wrong and the error will be canceled out if the difference is taken
 yah baat upar ke chitra se spasht ho jaaegi

 Along with this, its mosque is also built

 Skates on ice work because the metallic leaves under the skates shoes can slip on the ice surface with very little friction
 haalanki pattee par halkaa sa jhuk kar, dabaav badhaakar or inamen se ek kinare ko barf ke andar dhansa kar scater gharshan badhaane kii kshamta hasil kar saktaa he or apni icchaanusaar gati par niyantran kar sakate hai
 In addition, skaters can also use gravity to increase and control their speed by choosing the curved path and bending themselves to the center of the Earth and bending their knees
 ve pattiyon ko ghumaavdaar maarg main jahaan barf ke kataav hai uske vipareet dabaav, dhakel kar bhi gati utpann kar sakate hai
 Using both of these tilting and pushing actions with sensible ability — technically known as drawing — the skater can perform a gracefully curvaceous manner without any effort on the ice
 haalanki yah kam gharshan yukt sataha kis prakaar banati he iskaa vaastavik kaaran gyaat nahin he, par phir bhi is bare main kaaphi kuch jaankaree uplabdh he
 This is explained in more detail below: Experiments show that the minimum moving friction of ice is at -70 Celsius and that most intra-city skating rinks arrange their system according to this temperature
 vastav main aaklit itani kam gharshan maatra ko samajha paanaa bhautikavidon ke liye kathin he, khaskar itane kam taapmaana main
 -20 degree celsius se adhik taapmaana par barf kii kisi bhi sataha par hameshaa dravit pani kii ek patali film si hoti he, jisaki motaai kuch anuon se lekar hajaaron anuon tak ho sakati he
 And this is because it is not possible for the surface of such a crystalline structure to be completely dry
 The thickness of this fluid layer depends almost entirely on the surface temperature of the ice, where higher temperatures would mean a thicker layer
 Although skating is possible at temperatures far below -20 ° C
 arthath vah taapmaana jahaan drav kii prakritik parat paidaa nahin hoti
 jab kisi aais sket kii pattee barf ke upar se guzarati he barf ke andar do tarah ke parivartan aate he, gatij gharshan or urja kii garmi ke kaaran barf ke pighalane se iske bhautik swaroop main parivartan or doosraa iske taapmaana main parivartan hota he
 The primary danger of ice skating is to fall on the ice
 girane kii ashanka barf ke khurdarepan, aais skates ke aakaar prakaar or scater ke anubhav auki kshamtaaon par nirbhar karti he
 Although the risk of serious injury is very low, skaters in many small playgrounds have been paralyzed after colliding with boards
 girane par ek or khatra khud ke skates ke blades yaa dusron ke skates ke blades se ghayal hone kaa bhi hota he
 Falling can be very fatal if a helmet is not worn to avoid head injury
 haalanki durghatnaayen bahut kam hoti hai par jode main skating karne yaa ek saath skating, aamane saamne kii daud ke dauraan inaki ashankaayen zyada hoti hai
 The second and more serious threat occurs when someone falls into frozen water while ice while skating on a naturally frozen water ice field in the open
 This can lead to serious injury as well as death due to shock, hypothermia and drowning in water
 barf ke lagaataar tuutate chale jane, skates or sardi se bachane ke liye pahane gaye baari kapadon ke kaaran scater ke liye pani main se nikal kar barf ke upar aana bahut mushkil or kai maamalon main asambhav hota he
 Also, in this effort, the skater may be unconscious or may even fail to find the hole through which it has fallen into the water
 jiskaa parinaam pani main doobane yaa hipothermia ke rup main saamne aa saktaa he, lekin teji se thandak pahunchaakar aisa vaataravaran banaaya ja saktaa he ki koi pani main girane ke ghanton baad tak jivit rah saktaa he
 For safety, no one should skate alone in the dark, whenever someone visits a lake or river, it should be made a rule to always keep nails and ice hammer with you
 These can help any stray skater catch ice after falling into the water
