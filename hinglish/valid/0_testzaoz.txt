 Meanwhile, Deepak comes with his fiancee Sheetal
 jab pyaar ke bare main baatcheet utpann hoti he, deepak or baaki sheethal ko bataate hai ki sachcha pyaar hota he
 They tell him the story of Raj and Priya, two of his closest friends
 raaj maathur raaj transport kaa maalik he
 Raj is an unorganized and lazy person
 haalanki vah sabase amir nahin he, vah hameshaa khush rahata he
 On the other hand, Priya Chopra is a successful fashion designer whose family is quite wealthy
 priya mul rup se greece se he apni mausi aina ke saath rahati hai, jo use jivan main sarvshereshth dena chaahati hai
 Priya has all the plans in her life - the complete opposite of Raj
 ye do puri tarah se alag log car durghatana main milte hai, jab priya kii car raaj ke trek main durghatanavash takaraa gai
 They meet again at Salim and Farah's wedding and eventually become friends
 donon pyaar main dhire-dhire padate hai
 Raj obtains Priya's phone number but loses it carelessly
 phir vah use dhundne ne nikalataa he or use dhundta he
 However, Raj knows that Priya is engaged
 lekin vah greece main priya kaa anusaran karata he, jahaan vah use lubhaane jari rakhata he
 When it is time for Vida, Priya realizes that she is in love with Raj
 priya ke mata-pita ko manaane ke baad ve shaadi kar lete hai, or mumbai pahunchate hai, jahaan raaj priya kaa uske ghar main swaagat karata he
 Back to the present: Sheetal has tears in her eyes, as she never heard a more beautiful story
 saleem farah ke saath aata he or bataata he ki aaj raaj or priya kii shaadi kii pehali saalagirah he, isliye ve ek party kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Excited, Sheetal is eager to meet the famous Raj and Priya
 lekin jab ve pahunchate hai, to ve vaise nahin lagate jaisaa sochaa tha
 In a year both Raj and Priya have changed and both do not stop arguing
 jab unhen kuch saamaanya khushi milti he, to yah lambey samay tak nahin tikti
 Raj feels pressure to meet Priya's family's expectations and is struggling financially
 uski company diwalia ho gai he or uske paas bhugtan karne ke liye kai bill or rin hai
 When he is humiliated by a bank official, he returns home crying
 priya is haal main apane pati ko nahin dekh paati or paise apane purv mangetar se leti he
 When Raj asks her about the source of the money, she lies
 lekin jab vah ek utsav party detaa he, to vah sach jaan jaataa he
 Priya angrily tells him a lot and Priya heartily walks over to her parents
 raaj, apni galati ko samajhate hue priya ke paas jaataa he, lekin use uske parivaar dwaara apamaanit kiya jaataa he
 Priya decides to return to Greece
 jab raaj ko iske bare main suchit kiya jaataa he, to vah priya ko rokane ke liye hawaii adde par daudta he jaisaa ki usne pehle kiya tha
 He says that he will change and he has dreams of starting a family together
 yadhyapi priya ne vyakt kiya ki uske paas bhi ek hi sapana he, usase lagata he ki unka ek saath rahanaa asambhav he, isliye vah vimaan main baith jaati he
 When Raj returns home, Priya is arranging for him there
 vah kahati he ki apana sapana sach karne kaa ekmaatr tarika ek saath hona he
 In a playful way, the two argue another but they say that this is how they express their love
 film sampann hoti lekin vah bahes jari rakhte hai

 malayalam sahitya kaa itihaas sheershak pustak ke liye malayalam sahitya kaa itihaas:parameswaram nair dekhen
 There is no reliable and reliable evidence regarding the origin of Malayalam language or its literature
 phir bhi malayalam sahitya kii pracheenta lagbhag ek hajaar varsh tak kii maani gai hai
 Regarding language, we have only come to the conclusion that this language is not Sanskritic - it is a member of the Dravidian family
 parantu yah abhi tak vivaadaaspad he ki yah tamil se alag hui uski ek shakha he, athwa mul dravid bhashaa se viksit anya dakshini bhashaaon kii tarah apana astitv alag rakhanevaali koi bhashaa he
 That is, the problem is that the relationship between Tamil and Malayalam is between mother-daughter or sister-sister
 anusandhan dwaara is paheli kaa hal dhundne kaa kaary bhashaa-vaigyanikon kaa he or ve hi is gutthi ko sulajhaa sakate hai
 However, there is no doubt that Malayalam literature was flourishing only when Tamil literature had flourished
 sanskrit sahitya kii hi bhanti tamil sahitya ko bhi ham malayalam kii pyaas bujhaanewaali strothasvini kah sakate hai
 From 3100 BCE to 100 BCE, it was a local form of ancient Tamil
 isa purv pratham sadi se isapar sanskrit kaa prabhaav hua
 From the third century to the middle of the fifteenth century, Malayalam is considered medieval
 is kaal main jainiyon ne bhi bhashaa ko prabhavit kiya
 Modern times changed in the year 1795 when the British rule was fully established in this state
 malayalam sahitya ke itihaas kaa prabhaat geeton se guzyman he
 These include songs of Bhakti, Veeras and Kammaras as well as adult poetry
 is praudh rachanaaon main "ramcharitam" kaa sthaan sarvaadhik mahatvapurn he
 Its language is so close to Tamil that some Tamil scholars consider it to be the composition of Tamil, but today it is undoubtedly proved that Ramcharitam is Malayalam poetry and its author is also a Keralite
 isaki vishaywastu ramayana ke lankacand kii katha he
 It is composed by a poet named Chiraman from Kerala
 anusandhankartaaon kaa yahi mat he ki ramcharitam kaa rachanakaal 13veen shatabdi he
 In the period from the first to the eighth century AD, many famous Tamil compositions were born in the Chera kingdom, which later became Kerala
 "chilappatikaaram" ityadi ucch koti ke kaavyon kaa udhaaharan ham le sakate hai
 But it would be misleading to count Ramcharitam in this category, that is, Tamil compositions composed by Keralites
 ramcharitam kii rachana us kaal main hui thi jab sanskrit kaa prasar kerala main jam chukaa tha or manipravalam naamak mishra bhashaa viksit ho rahi thi
 In Ramcharitam, Sanskrit and similar words are found in abundance in Sanskrit
 parantu dravid aksharon dwaara likhe jane ke kaaran inke roopon main thodaa parivartan aayaa he
 From the seventh century AD onwards, the Aryan dynasty Namputiris had considerable influence in the cultural region of Kerala
 adhiktar anusandhaataaon kaa yahi mat he ki ve bahut pehle hi kerala main aa chuke the
 Due to these influences, a mixed language called Manipravalam developed in Kerala
 10veen or 15veen sadi isvi ke madhya manipraval sahitya kii atyadhik pushti hui
 Through this Manipraval, many Sanskrit poetic forms were transitioned to Malayalam
 champu kavy, sandesh kavy ityadi kaa udhaaharan ham le sakate hai
 "uniyacchi Charitam", Unnikichirutevicharitam "and Uniyati" Charitam "are ancient Manipraval Champu
 unniyai charitam kaa rachanakaal 14veen sadi kaa purvardh he
 Uniyatichritam was written around 1350 AD and its author is Damodar Chakyar
 unniyai charitam kaa rachayita thevan chirikuman naamak kavi mana jaataa he
 Unchichirutevi Charitamco is considered contemporary of these
 parantu yah kis kavi kii rachana he, is sambandh main koi jaankaree nahin he
 As is known by their names, their content is a commendation of some famous beauties
 sandesh kaavyon main "ushnnunilisandeshm" or "kohsandeshm" mahatvapurn hai
 It is believed that the creation period of both is 14th century
 inke rachayita kaviyon ke sambandh main kuch pataa nahin he
 Some miniature Maniprawal works were also composed between the 10th and 15th centuries
 inamen se adhiktar kuch vilasavati sundariyon se sambhddha shringaaras kii rachanaayen hai
 These include the descriptions of the heroines Ilaychi, Cheriyachi, Uttarachandraika, Kaunottara, Mallinilava, Marlekha, etc
 "vaishikantram" is a collection of Kuladharma teachings given to a Vaishyaputri; Its creation is probably 11th century
 bhaktipradhan rachanaayen bhi manipraval sahitya main milti hai
 Anantapurvarnam, Srikrishnastavam, Dasavatarcharitam etc
 are examples of these
 "chandrotsavam 15veen sadi ke ek agyatnama kavi kii rachana he
 The theme is the description of the Chandrotsav celebrated by the courtesan called "medinivenilava"
 manipraval sahitya ke prasar ne us bhashaaroop ke vyakaran niyamon evam saahitiyik lakshanon kaa vivaran denevaale ek shaastragranth kii rachana kii prerana di
 The name of this book is "lilatikam"
 yah anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki "leelatilakam" 14veen sadi main likhaa gaya he
 If on one side Manipraval literature continued to develop, on the other side the poetry book named "pattu" also increased
 jaisaa upar kaha gaya he, is shakha main dharmik evam kheti or anya peshon se sambhddha anek loakgeet hai
 Toram pattu, sarpam pattu, ayyapp, pattu etc
 are related to ethics and religious subjects
 krishippattu, ararupattu, vallappattu ityadi duusare varg main aate hai
 The basic components of these songs are - vocals, rhythm and rhythm
 praudh geet lokgeeton se bhinn hai
 The above mentioned "ramcharitam" is the first notable in this department
 leelatilakam main praudh pattu kavy ke liye di gai paribhaasha isamen thik baithti he
 The words used in the later "niranam" songs are not simply Dravidian letters
 inamen aise sanskrit padon kii bharmaar he jinase yah pataa chalata he ki sanskrit ke aksharon kaa paryaapt prachaar is samay tak ho chukaa tha
 This view has been recognized that the songs of Niranam were written between the late 14th and early 15th centuries
 ramcharitam or niranam geeton ke kaalon main ek yaa dedh shatabdiyon se adhik kaa antar nahin he
 Yet the language difference between the two is highly evident
 isse yah anumaan hota he ki yadhyapi ramcharitam ke samay main manipraval viksit ho chukaa tha tathaapi is kavy main jaan boojhkar keval tamil ke aksharon dwaara likhe jane yogya padaavalee kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 The nine poets are three - Madhav Panikkar, Shankar Panikkar and Ram Panikkar
 madhav panikkar dwaara anudit bhagavadgita ne bhashaa ko gauravanvit kiya--bharat kii pradeshik bhashaaon main rachit geetanuvaadon main yahi sarvapratham or sarvapramukh he
 It has seven hundred verses translated into 328 songs
 gita kaa aashaygambhiry or mahatta kaa anuwaad main leshmaatr bhi lop nahin hua he
 Shankar Panikkar's composition is a song called "bharatmala"
 ram panikkar ne ramayana, bharat or bhagwat kaa sankshipt anuwaad kiya
 It would not be wrong to say that this poet, who empowered Malayalam to stand on his feet, can be considered the father of language - though in the eyes of the historians, Tushtut Eshuttachdan deserves this title; In my view, it would be a pleasure to give the above title to this Ram poet, known as Kannashishna, because he is also eligible for the Acharyapada of Eshootachchan
 uparyukt saare kavy puranakthaon ke punrakhyaan hai
 But the "krishnagatha", invented in the fifteenth century, is not merely a re-narration of the Purana
 isamen bhagwat ke dasham skandh main varnit krishnagatha kaa anvakhyaan is prakaar sabit hua he ki sanskrit mahakavyon kaa rupashilp manjari chand main--jo dravid chhandon ke parinat prakaaron main se ek he--avatarit hua he
 Therefore, Krishnagatha can be considered as the first independent epic of Malayalam
 rituon ke kavi ke naam se prakhyat krishnagathakar ne prakrutivarnanon dwaara nutan saundarya prapanchon kaa saakshaatkaar karaayaa
 The melodious songs, the fine and gentle pedestal, the choreographed imagination - Krishnagatha has become a hypnotic work due to these
 dekhen - tunchattu ramanujan eshuttachhan The most important department of the Pattu branch is "kilippattu"
 tunchatt eshuttachhan ko is vidha kaa sansthaapak maanate hai
 It contains the spoken narrative of "kili" meaning parrot, hence it is called kilippattu
 eshuttachhan kaa kaal 16veen shatabdi kaa purvardh he
 At this time Kerala was experiencing a type of political, social and cultural relaxation
 is ad:patan se kerala kaa abhyutthan karaane ke hetu avatarit divya purush ke rup main hi kerala kii janata aaj bhi eshuttachhan ko maanati he
 He enlightened the public with the address of devotion
 namdev, kabir, chaitanya, surdaas, tulsidas, maanikkavachakar, compar ityadi bhakt kaviyon se bhasvar nabhomandal main kerala kii disha se udit tarak eshuttachhan hai
 Like all of them, Eshutachchan also succeeded in awakening and enlightening the public
 ramayana, bharat or bhagwat, in teenon ke sankshipt anuwaad ke madhyam se eshuttachhan ne samast keralavaasiyon ke hridayon main sidhe pravesh paaya
 Kerala received a new Garima, seriousness, decency and self-reliance
 isi arth main eshuttachhan ko malayalam sahitya kaa pita maanate hai
 They are poets who are equally adorned in huts and palaces
 pattu vibhaag main doosraa bhaktipradhan gaankavy "puntanam" kii "gyanappana" he
 Other hymns of Puntanam are also full of Lalit, Komal and Bhaktisudha
 is vibhaag kii anya ullekhneey rachanaayen kuch loakgeet or "vatakkan pattu" tathaa "tekkan patte" ke naamon se vikhyath kuch aakhyanatmak gaan kavy hai
 As the names are known, these songs are the heroines of North and South Kerala respectively
 uttari geeton kii bhashaa aadhunik malayalam se milti julati he, parantu dakshini geeton main bhashaa kaa tamil se samipya adhik he
 The influence of Tamil in southern songs composed between the 16th and 18th centuries probably indicates close contact with the Tamil territories of South Kerala, not the lack of independent development of the language
 dakshin ke kavi dwibhasha ke vidvan the
 The second phase of Champu poetry under the Maniprawal movement is visible again in the 15th century
 yadhyapi is kaal main teen sau se bhi adhik champu kavy rache gaye to bhi inamen punam namputiri kaa ramayana or mashamangalam narayanan namputiri kaa bhashanaishadh ityadi champu hi vishesh dhyaan dene yogya hai
 The period of Poonam should be in the first half of the 15th century or the late 16th century
 naishadhachampookar kaa kaal 16veen shatabdi kaa madhya he
 Although according to the development, Uttara Manipraval should have predominated Malayalam, yet Sanskrit-dominated language has been adopted in these champs
 aisi sthiti paidaa hui ki adhikansh champuon ko samajhane ke liye sanskrit kaa gyaan anivaary ho gaya
 Because of this Maniprawal literature kept away from the general public
 aattakkatha nritykala se sambhddha sahitya vibhaag he
 The name of this color is "kathakali"
 aattakkatha malayalam kii ek vipul sahityashakha he
 Today Kathakali has international honor
 is kalaroop ko yah sthiti pradaan karne main iske aadharbhoot sahitya ne mahaan yogadan diya he
 In the late 17th century the Manveda king of Kozhikot composed a Sanskrit poem called "krishnagiti"
 iske aadhaar par "krishnanattam" naamak nritykala kaa bhi aavirbhaav hua
 It was planned to play the story of Shri Krishna in eight days
 krishnanattam kii dekha dekhi "ramnattam" naamak duusare nritykala-rup kaa bhi avishkaar kiya gaya
 In the basic literature of this art form, the Ramakatha is divided into eight playable segments in the night
 iske rachayita kottarakkara ke raja he
 There are two views regarding his life
 kuch log inhen satrahavin shatabdi ke maanate he, duusare 15-16veen shatabdi ke
 Today's Kathakali previews are visible in Ramanattam
 kottayam ke raja ne, jinka jeevankaal 17veen sadi kaa antim charan mana jaataa he, ramnattem kaa sanshodhan or parishkaran karke kathakali ke aadhunik rup kaa vikaas kiya
 His compositions are four - all based on anecdotes of the Mahabharata
 karthik thirunal, ashwavati thirunal ityadi raajaaon ne bhi aattakkathaon main sarvottam kriti unnayi variyar rachit "nalcharitam" he
 Nalcharitam is an actor in four nights
 kuch vidvan unnayi variyar ko 16veen shatabdi ke antim or 17veen shatabdi ke pratham paad kaa maanate hai to duusare 17veen 18veen sadiyon ke antya aadya paad ke
 This talented poet inaugurated an Amodha path for attakathas
 uchhrunkhal pad-yojan-style, achumbit kalpanavaibhav or gambhir jivan-darshan-patutaa se yah kavi anugrihit he
 "girijakalyanam" song management is also considered by some scholars as Unnayi Warrier
 isaki rachana kilippattu ke chhandon main anuprasyukt style main hui he
 During the 18th century, there was a great rise: the rise of the Punj - Kunchan Nampyar, a scholar of Tullah literature
 sambhav he, tullal jaise kalaroop pehle bhi rahe hon
 But there is no doubt that this talented poet developed Tullal as a movement
 ek prakaar se tullal ko nrityaatmak ekabhinay kah sakate hai
 Tullal Geet is literature as its basis
 nampyar ne tullal geeton ke kathanak ke rup main puraanon ke upaakhyaan hi liye hai
 Nevertheless, the atmosphere coming in the narratives is not mythical but it matches the contemporary life of Kerala
 nampyar ne puranic itivritton ke madhyam se tatkaaleen jivan kii vaiyaktik or saamaajik viklaataaon par tikhe vyangabaan chalaae hai
 The goal of this sharp edge of his gimmick was to tear the bones of social body
 tullal sahitya main satair vidha kaa atyadhik sampann kavyalok darshneey he
 No one comes before them, neither before, nor after
 yadi parihaas ko safal bananaa he to sookshm, nirmam or vyapak marmbodh apekshit he
 This accomplishment is abundant, being a humorous ideal of nampyar
 unke hasya or marmoktiyon main vidwesh kii jwaala nahin chubhti, varan hardik sahanubhuti or maanav prem kaa chaitanya hi sfurit hota he
 Another important composition of the Pattu branch is the "kuchelavrittam" Vanchappattu of the 18th-century poet Rampuram Warrier
 shuru shuru main malayalam main gadhy sahitya kii khaas pragati nahin hui thi
 In the 10th or 11th century written "bhashakautaliyam" Kutiyattam, the scripture called "aattapakaraam", giving reference to the performance, 14th century "dootavakyam" prose, "brahmavapuranam" prose of the same century, "ambarishcharitam", "devibhagavatam" etc
 prose - in All can be considered as the gift of ancient times for prose literature
 taddeshiy isai dharmprachaarkon ne kuch gadhy granth 16veen, 17veen tathaa 18veen sadiyon main likh hai
 These include "abbreviation Vedartham" "vedatarkam" etc
 "vartmanppustakam" sarvapratham yatrasahitya he
 The period of some time after Kunchan Nampyar is bleak for Malayalam
 kareeb aadhi shatabdi tak ko is avadhi main kisi jyoti kaa udai nahin hua
 Later Swati was the good morning of Tirunal's era
 iryimman tampi kilimanoor koyittampuran ityadi aattakkathakaron ne swathithirunal kaa prashray paaya
 Swati Tirunal was a poet herself and wrote songs in Hindi as well
 iske baad kerala verma koyittapuran ke kaal se malayalam sahitya ke aadhunik yug kaa prarambh ho jaataa he
 a renaissance in literature under the leadership of this talented writer, conferred with the title of Sahitya Swarbhavam
 "mayurasandeshm" naamak sandesh kavy, "shakuntalam" naatak kaa anuwaad or akbar naamak upanyaas unki rachanaaon main mukhya hai
 His Shakuntal translation was accompanied by a flood of translations of Sanskrit plays into Malayalam
 chattukkutti mannatiyaar, kunjikkuttan tampuran, kottarattil shankunni ityadi ne is shakha kii pushti kii
 Similar to culture plays, independent Malayalam plays were also written
 kerala verma ke bhaaginey rajraj verma ne bhi kalidas aadi ke granthon ko anuwaad kiya
 It was these Rajaraja Varma who gave Malayalam a grammar book called "keralapaniniyam" and a treatise text "vrattamanjari"
 ye bhi apane maatul kii tarah sabake liye preranastrot or maardarshak rahe
 In this era, the originator of the fierce controversy which broke out between the biographers and opponents of the initials were respectively Matul Bhaginya
 is vivaad main svachhndathawad ke "rup se bhav kii ore" vaale aahvaan kii pehali goonj sunai detii hai
 It was in this period that Malayalam epics were created as imitations of Sanskrit epics
 krishnagatha ke baad manipraval main ek mahakavy--"shrikrishnacharitam"—kii rachana hui 
 This epic will be followed by at least a century until the beginning of the era of imitative epics
 ashkatt padmanabh kurup kaa "ramchandravilasam", pantalam kerala verma kaa "rugmangadcharitam" or "vijayodaym", ullur kaa "umakeralam", vallattol kaa "chitrayogam", ke si keshav pilla kaa "keshavium", kitunellur kochunni tampuran kaa vanchishvansham" or "pandavodayam", vatakkumkur rajraj verma kaa "raghuveeravijayam" or "raghavabhudaym", kattakkaum cherian mappila kaa "shreeyeshuvijaym", ityadi malayalam ke pramukh mahakavy hai
 They were written between 1902 and 1917
 gadhy-sahitay main upanyaason kaa udai bhi unnisvin sadi main kerala verma yug main hi hua tha
 The first novel is "kudlata" written by Appu Netunayati
 ek do saal main chantu menon ne indulekha kaa prakaashan kiya
 Chant Menon wrote the first part of the novel called "sharda" - and went to heaven before the second part was composed
 indulekha or sharada aaj bhi malayalam ke saamaajik upanyaason kii pratham shrenee main sthit hai
 Chantu Menon's talent is unique among social novelists
 teen aitihaasik upanyaason "martand verma" "dharmaraaja" or "ramraaja bahadur" ke lekhak si ve raaman pilla aitihaasik upanyaas ke kshetra main vishesh prasiddh hai
 The importance of his social "premamritam" is not so much
 aisa prathit hota he ki unke jivan kaa uddeshy hi aitihaasik upanyaason dwaara malayalam kii garima badhaane kaa tha
 Contemporary poets of Kerala Varma had many Rasik poets
 puuntottam nanputiri, venmani pita or putr, kotungllur kunjikkuttan tampuran, kochuriun tampuran ityadi kaviyon ne milakar ek nutan kavyarup ko janm diya
 All of them were ready to use simple language
 is pravriti ko vikaas "pachch malayalam" andolan ke rup main hua
 Kunnikkuttan Tampuran, Kundur Narayan Menon etc
 were proficient in this type of language experiment
 parantu khed he ki "pachch malayalam" andolan samay se pehle hi samaapt ho gaya
 Yet the poetic style and approach adopted by the poets such as Venmani has further influenced their poets
 manipraval kaal kii shringaar pravriti ne inaki kavita main nae rup main pravesh paaya
 Kunikkuttan Tampuran, the poet at the peak of this movement, is not considered to be an epiphany because he has written some poems in pure Malayalam; But the reason for this is that in the period above just two years of his short lifetime, he showed a miracle that cannot be considered masculine
 yah mahaan kavi is chote arse main sampurna mahabharat kaa malayalam main chhandash: or padash: anuwaad karne main safal hue
 This task did not require even three years to complete the work which required three generations of cultivation in Telugu to complete it! a stream of poetry flowed from his mouth, not that he "wrote" poetry
 unki "saras-drut-kavi-kirit-mani" kii oopaadhi unke liye sarvatha sarthak thi
 It was also appropriate to call him "kerala Vyas"
 ab ham malayalam ke svachhndathawadi andolan ke yug main aa jate hai
 V
C Balakrishna Panikkar's "oru Vilapam" etc
 are memorable in this context
 parantu kumaran aashan kaa "veen poou" hi is andolan kii praarambhik rachanaaon main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn he
 Malay as Alm Romanticism Ashan poetry blossomed and flowered
 nalini, lila, chintavishtyaay sita, chandalabhikshuki, prarodanam, duravastha, karunaa ityadi inaki mukhya rachanaayen hai
 The poetic trajectory that Ashaan succeeded in exposing is a philosopher with serious philosophical, indomitable curiosity of life-giving and intense emotion
 aashan hi vah kavi the jinhone shringaar ko saamaanya dharaatal se swargik vishuddhta tak pahunchaaya
 His poetry is complemented by a beautiful imagination of spiritual love
 vallattol kii safalataa isamen thi ki ve maanav ke maansik bhav ko kaalpaniktaa kaa paridhaan dekar sudar rup main prastut kar sake
 He translated the Balmiki Ramayana in 1909
 1910 main "badhirvilapam" naamak vilaapkavy likhaa
 After that he wrote many dramatic expressions - Ganapathi, Bandhanasthanaay Anirudhan, Oru Kattu, Shishyunum Makanum, Magdalan Mari Yama, Achhukanum Makanum Kochusita etc
 san 1924 ke baad rachit sahityamanjariyon main hi vallattol ke deshbhakti se otprot ve kavyasuman khile the jinhone unako rashtrakavi ke pad par asin kiya
 Enre Gurunathan etc
 are highly popular in those expressions

 Ullur, who immortalized his name in poetry by creating an epic called "umakarelam", also composed many clauses and hymns
 pingala, karnbhooshnam, bhakthideepika, chitrashaala ityadi khandakavyon or kiranavali, taraharam tarangini ityadi kavitaasangrahon dwaara unhone malayalam kii shrivriddhi kii he
 But the memory of this great scholar and philanthropist litterateur will probably remain mainly in the hearts of Malayalam lovers as the author of Kerala literature Charitram

 G

 Champusha is called the 'gana Gandharva' of Malayalam
 kisi bhi anya kavi ne kavita main itnaa adhik swarmadhurya nahin ghola he
 His dramatic gesture "ramanan" has become a classic
 ramanan kii jitani pratiyaan biki hai utani shaayad eshuttachhan ke aadhyatm ramayana ko chhodkar or kisi rachana nahin biki hongi
 Many of his lines are memorized to every Keralite

 Sugatkumari's attitude towards life is philosophical

 P
 Bhaskaran and Vayalar Ramavarma went into the field of film songs after gaining a reputation as revolutionary poets
 en en coccat, madhavan ayyappatt, ayyapp panikkar or en en palur angreji ke naveenatam unmukt kavyavidhaon kaa prayog malayalam main karne main siddhhast hai
 The latest theory in poetics is that the goal of the poem is to attract attention by staring
 uparyukt kaviyon kii kavitaaon main yahi vidha apanaai gai
 Akkittam Achuthan Namputiri Ittasheri and NVV are poets depicting the path paved by Krishna Warrier
 unka kavy "irupatham nurrantinre itihaasam" valloppilli ke kutiyoshikkal kii hi bhanti mahatvapurn hai
 In the absence of any goal, the great ideal of revolution is misleading and the groans of the elitist soul of the wandering modern human are heard in this poem
 malayalam ke upanyaas sahitya, naatak sahitya or kahani sahitya kaa vikaas bhi 20veen sadi main hua
 Chant Menon and CV Raman Pilla followed the simulations in the novel branch for some time

 The contribution made by the late A
 Balakrishna Pilla in developing the personality of these storytellers is significant
 mopassaan prabhruti francisi sahityakaron or chekhav prabhruti roosi sahityakaron dwaara prashast kiye gaye margon main hamaare kahanikaron ko le jane kaa shrey inhen baalkrishna pilla ko he
 These inspired the Malayalam storytellers to write stories that enlighten the cultural, social, economic revolution and reveal psychological elements

 Iti Vyasakritam Shri Bhagavatistotram Sampoornam nailcandpalli main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke krishna jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Hyperthyroidism, or hyperthyroidism, is a term used for hyperactive tissues within the thyroid that leads to an overproduction of the thyroid hormone
 is tarah, atigalagranthita, thyrotoxicosis, arthath rakt main bade hue galagranthi hormone kii naidanik sthiti, kaa ek kaaran he
 It is worth noting that hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are not synonymous
 udhaaharan ke liye, thyrotoxicosis bajaay iske bahirzaat thyroid hormone ke antargrahan yaa thyroid granthi kii sujan ke kaaran ho saktaa he, jisaki vajah se yah apane thyroid hormone ke bhandar se sravit hone lagata he
 thyroid hormone koshikeey str par mahatvapurn he, jo sharir ke lagbhag har prakaar ke utak ko prabhavit karata he
 When the thyroid gland starts producing hormones in large quantities, the body starts using energy more than the quantity
 ise hyper thyrodism yaa avatu garnthi kii atisakriyata kehete hai
 This disease can happen to people of any age, however the ratio of female to male is five to eight times more than that of male
 avatugranthi ek choti si granthi hoti he jo titali ke aakaar kii nichle gardan ke bich main hoti he
 Its basic function is to control the metabolism of the body
 upaapachay ko niyantrit karne ke liye avatugranthi hormone banaata he jo sharir ke koshikaon ko yah bataata he ki kitni urja kaa upyog kiya janaa he
 If the thyroid gland works properly then the right amount of hormones required for the metabolism of the body will remain at a satisfactory rate
 jaise-jaise hormone kaa upyog hota rahata he, avatugranthi uski pratisthapana karata rahata he
 The thyroid gland controls the amount of hormones in the bloodstream by operating the pituitary gland
 jab mastishk ke neeche khopadi ke bich main sthit pituitary granthi ko yah pataa chalata he ki avatugranthi hormone kii kami hui he yaa uski maatra adhik he to vah apane hormone ko samyojit karata he or avatugranthi ko bataata he ki kya karnaa he
 The thyroid hormone acts as a controller of the speed of all processes in the body
 is gati ko chayapachay kaha jaataa he
 If there is too much thyroid hormone, then every action of the body starts accelerating
 isliye aashcharya kii baat nahin he ki atigalagranthita ke kuch lakshanon main shaamil ghabrahat, chidchidapan, pasinaa main vruddhi, dil kaa joro se dhadkna, haath kaa kaanpana, chintaa, sone main takalif hona, twachaa kaa patala hona, najuk bal, khaskar upree bahon or jaanghon kii mansapeshiyon main kamajori aana, shaamil hai
 Intestinal disturbances can be very frequent, but diarrhea or diarrhea is uncommon
 kaaphi bhukh ke baavjood kabhi-kabhi bahut adhik vajan main kami aa sakati he, ulti ho sakati he or, mahilaon main, masik srav halkaa ho saktaa he or masik srav aksar kam ho sakate hai
 Thyroid hormone is important for normal function of cells
 iske alaava, yah chayapachay ko atiuttejit or samvedi tantrika pranali ke prabhaav ko teevr karata he, isse vibhinn shaareerik pranali "tej" ho jaati he or epinephrine ke overdoj ke lakshan dikhne lagate hai
 These include heart palpitations and palpitations, symptoms of hand tremors such as nervous system tremor and anxiety, hyperactivity of the digestive system, excess weight loss and abnormal reduction in fat levels by blood tests
 atigalagranthita aamtaur par dhire-dhire shuru hoti he
 At first, it can be mistaken to understand the symptoms by considering simple nervousness due to stress
 agar koi vyakti dieting ke jariye vajan ghataane kii koshish kar rahaa he, to koi vyakti atigalagranthita se vajan ghatane se prasann ho saktaa he, jisame badi teji se vajan main kami aati he, jisase anya samasyaayein paidaa hoti hai
 In Graves' disease, which is the most common form or cause of hyperthyroidism, the upper eyelid can become enlarged, making the eyes look larger
 kabhi-kabhi, ek yaa donon ankhen baahar ubhar aati hai
 Some patients have swelling of the front neck due to enlargement of the thyroid gland
 atigalagranthita ke kaaran, vishesh rup se grevs' rog, parivaar main ho saktaa he; parivaar ke sadsy kii jaanch se anya sadasyon main bhi thyroid kii samasyaayein saamne aa sakati hai
 On the other hand, a decrease in the functioning thyroid tissue results in a symptomatic decrease in thyroid hormone, known as hypothyroidism
 atigalagranthita aksar hi antat avatu-alpakriyata main badal jaati he
 Major clinical symptoms include weight loss, anxiety, heat intolerance, hair loss, muscle aches, weakness, fatigue, hyperactivity, irritability, hypersensitivity, apathy, polyuria, hyperlipidia, delirium, tremor, pretibial mixida, and sweating
 iske alaava, rogiyon main or bhi vibhinn prakaar ke lakshan dikh sakate hai, jaise ki dhakdhaki or atalata, shwaas ksht, kamechha main kami, michali, ulti or dast
 dirghakaalik anupachaarit atigalagranthita se asthi-sushirta ho sakati he
 These classical symptoms may often not be present in the elderly
 snaivik pratyakshikaran main kampan, nartanrog, peshivikruti or kuch atisamvedansheel vyaktiyon main aavadhik pakshaaghaat ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 a relationship has been found between thyroid disease and spontaneous muscular weakness
 is haalat main, thyroid rog swabhaav se swarogksham hota he or lagbhag 5% sahaj peshi durbalata ke rogiyon main atigalagranthita bhi paayi jaati he
 Very rarely cases of spontaneous muscular weakness improve after treatment with thyroid and the relationship between the two has not been properly understood
 kuch bahut hi durlabh snaivik pratyakshikaran jo ki sandigdh rup se thyrotoxicosis ke saath jude hai ve hai sudotumor ceribri yaa pramastishk, peshishoshi parshv kaathinya or gulian-bare-jaisaa syndrome
 The short-sighted symptoms that may be present in any type of hyperthyroidism are eyelid withdrawal, weakness of the extra ocular muscles and retardation of the papilla
 In the hyperthyroid gaze, the eyelids are more upward than normal, a normal condition, where the "white" of the eye begins at the upper border of the pupil of the eye)
 Extra-vision weaknesses may be present with double vision
 mand-palak main, jab rogi apni aankh se neeche kii ore kisi vastu kaa peechha karata he, tab neeche kii ore gumti yaa jhukati putliyon kaa anusaran karne main palken vifal rahati hai or upree ore ke pradarshan main bhi usee prakaar ke hona ko palak pratigaman kaa hona kehete hai, asthaayee rup se
 atigalagranthita ke upachaar ke saath ye lakshan yaa sanket gaayab ho jate hai
 Any of these symptoms or signs of vision should not be confused with exophthalmos, which is particularly and uniquely caused by Graves' disease in hyperthyroidism
 Frontal bulge or exfoliation of the eyes is due to immune mediated inflammation in the pre-articular fat
 exonthalmos jab maujuud ho, tab atigalagranthi mand-palak or takataki ko teevr kar saktaa he
 Thyrotoxic distress is rare but is a serious problem of hyperthyroidism, which can be caused by a thyrotoxic patient becoming very ill or physically exhausted
 iske lakshan main shaamil hai: sharir ke taapmaana main 40 degree celsius se adhik kii vruddhi, drutanaadi, atalata, ulti, dast, nirjaleekaran, coma or mrityu
thyroid tufaan kaa apatkaaleen upachaar or aspataal main bhartee hona jaruri he
 Reducing the levels of circulating thyroid hormones and decreasing their production is the main treatment
 propilathiourossil or methimazol aise do agent hai jo thyroid hormone sanshleshan main kami laate hai or aamtaur par inaki ucch khuraaq di jaati he
 Sodium iodide, potassium iodide, and / or lugol solution may be given to inhibit the secretion of thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland
 propranolol jaise beta blowers hriday kii dar ko niyantrit karne main madad kar sakate hai or rakt sanchaar main sahaayta karne ke liye antahshira steroid kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 At the beginning of this century, thyroid storm mortality had reached 100%
 haalanki, ab, upar varnit chikitsa ke aakraamak upyog se, thyroid tufaan se mrityu dar 20% se kam ho gayi he
 Hyperthyroidism has the following symptoms: yadi avatugranthi kii beemaari jaldi pakad main aa jaati he to lakshan dikhaai dene se pehle upachaar se yah thik ho saktaa he
 The thyroid gland lasts a lifetime
 dhyanpurvak iske prabandhan se avatugranthi se peedit vyakti apana jivan swasth or saamaanya rup se ji sakate hai
 There are many reasons for hyperthyroidism
 adhikanshtah, sampoorn granthi thyroid hormone kaa ati-utpaadan karne lagati he
 This is called Graves' disease
 aam taur par kam maamalon main, atirikt hormone srav ke liye ek akeli granthika jimmedaar hoti he, jise "garm" granthika kaha jaataa he
 Thyroiditis can also cause hyperthyroidism
 anek naidanik sthitiyon main kaaryshil thyroid utak dwaara atirikt thyroid hormone kaa utpaadan kiya jane lagata he
 Following are the main reasons for this in humans: anek anya kaarnon se thyroid hormone kaa ucch rakt str ho saktaa he: Measuring levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone () produced by the mucous gland in the blood) is a preliminary test of particularly suspected hyperthyroidism
 ti kaa nimna str par vishisht rup se ingit karata he ki shlashmik granthi ko mastishk dwaara thyroid granthi ke uttejan main katautee karne ke liye rukaawat daali gayi he yaa "nirdeshit" kiya gaya he, jisase rakt main T4 or / yaa T3 ke staron main vruddhi hone lagati he
 Rarely, an inferior TSH indicates primary failure of the mucosa, or temporary blockage of the mucosa due to other disease, and therefore examination of T4 and T3 is still clinically useful
 grevs rog main prati-ti-abhigraahak rog-pratikaarak yaa hashimoto ke thyroditis main prati-thyroid-paroxides jaise vishisht rog-pratikaarakon ko maapne se bhi rog nidaan main yogadan ho saktaa he
 Blood tests confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, indicating a decrease in thyroid stimulation hormone levels and an increase in T4 and T3 levels
 ti mastishk main shlashmik granthi dwaara banaaya gaya ek hormone he, jo thyroid granthi ko bataata he ki kitna hormone bananaa he
 When thyroid hormone is very high, then TSH decreases
 radiodharmee iodine udgrahan pareekshan or thyroid scan donon atigalagranthita ke kaaran kaa charitra-chithran karte hai yaa radiologist or doctoron ko atigalagranthita ke kaaran ke nirdhaaran main sakasham banaate hai
 Empty stomach radioactive iodine injection is used during the levitation test to measure the amount of iodine absorbed by the thyroid gland or injected into the body by mouth
 atigalagranthita se grast vyakti bahut zyada iodine aatmsaat kar lete hai
 Specifically operated thyroid scan images in connection with the levitation test, allowing visual examination of the gland's hyperactivity
 atigalagranthita or thyroditis se aayi is beemaari ke charitra chithran ke liye thyroid cintigraphy ek upyogi pareekshan he
 This test system typically involves two interconnected tests: a iodine levitation test and a scan with a gamma camera
 The levitation test involves taking a single dose of radioactive iodine, specifically iodine-123 or 123I, as the most suitable isotopic of iodine for clinical studies of thyroid disease
 thyroid utak or thyroid cancer aparoopaantaran kii chhaviyaan banane ke liye I-123 lagbhag iodine kaa adarsh samasthanik he
 Typically, a tablet containing sodium iodide is swallowed by mouth, containing small amounts of iodine-123, possibly less than a grain of salt
 aam taur par goli nigalane se pehle do ghante or uske baad ek ghante tak upwas main rahanaa aavashyak he
 They are generally tolerated by these low doses of radioiodine that are otherwise allergic to iodine and cannot tolerate adverse medium containing large doses of iodine used in similar image-forming diagnostic systems)
 The body excretes excess radioiodine that cannot be absorbed into the thyroid gland by the urine
 kuch rogi naidanik radioiodine se halki allergic pratikraya kaa anubhav kar sakate hai or unhen histaminarodhi diya ja saktaa he
 The patient usually regains the level of radioiodine "levitation" 24 hours later, measured with an instrument connected to a metal spindle tied to the throat, measuring radioactivity emission from the thyroid
 is pareekshan main 4 minute lagate hai, tab tak mashin software ke dwaara udgrahan % sanchit hota he
 Typically, a scan is also performed, where images of the anomalous thyroid gland are taken from the gamma camera; The radiologist studies it and after examining the images produces a report mentioning the levitation% and giving his comment
 atigalagranthi ke rogi vishishtatya saamaanya se unche str kaa radioiodine "grahan karte" hai
 The typical range of RAI levitation is from 10–30%
 ti staron ke pareekshan ke alaava, anek doctor adhik vistrut parinaamon ke liye T3, free T3, T4 or / yaa free T4 ke bhi pareekshan karte hai
 Typical adult limits for these hormones are: TSH: 0
45 - 4
50 uiu / ml, T4 free / direct: 0
82 - 1
77 ng / dl; And T3: 71 - 180 ng / dl
 Individuals with hyperthyroidism can easily display these upper limits of T4 and / or T3 several times
 thyroid granthi aalekh main thyroid kaary kii saamaanya shrenee simaaon kii sampurna talika dekhen
 The following are the causes of hyperthyroidism maanav main atigalagranthita ke upachaar ke liye brihad or aam taur par sweekaarya roopaatmakataaon main damanaatmak thyrostetics upachaar kaa praarambhik asthaayee upyog shaamil he or sambhawatah baad main sthaayee shalya chikitsa yaa radio samasthanik chikitsa kaa upyog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 All the pathways under active thyroid function can be the cause, which can be easily handled with levothyroxine supplementation
 thyrostetics dawaaen thyroid hormone ke utpaadan ko atakati hai, jaise ki karbimajol or methimajol or propylathuresil
 mana jaataa he ki thyrostetics thyroparoxides dwaara thyroglobulin ke iodinikaran ko rokane kaa kaam karata he or is tarah tetra-yodothyronin ke nirmaan ko roktaa he
 Propylthurasil also functions outside the thyroid gland, actively inhibiting the conversion of T3 into T3
 chunki thyroid utak aamtaur par thyroid hormone kaa ek bada sanchay rakhe hote hai, isliye thyrostetics ko prabhavi ho paane main kai saptaah lag jate hai or khuraaq ko praayah maheenon kii avadhi main titrate karne kii jarurat padati he, saath hi niyamit rup se doctoron kii dekhbhaal or parinaamon kii jaanch ke liye rakt pareekshan bhi karte rahanaa padataa he
 Initial treatment often requires a very high dose, but patients may develop symptoms of hyperactivity if a high dose is used continuously
 khuraaq kaa yah anumapank sahi dhang se kar paanaa mushkil he or isiilie kabhi-kabhi "baadha va pratisthaapan" kaa dhang apanaaya jaataa he
 In obstruction and replacement therapy, sufficient amounts of thyrostatics are taken to completely stop thyroid hormones, treating the patient as if he has complete hypothyroidism
 dhakdhaki, kampan or vyagrata jaise atigalagranthita ke aam lakshanon main se anek koshika satahon par beta adrinergik abhigrahakon main vruddhi dwaara bich-bachaav kiye jate hai
 Beta blockers, typically used in the treatment of high blood pressure, are drugs that counterbalance this effect, reduce palpitations associated with palpitations, and decrease tremor and anxiety
 is prakaar, atigalagranthita se peedit marij aksar tatkaal asthaayee raahat praapt kar sakate hai, jab tak ki upar bataaye radioiodine pareekshan se atigalagranthita kaa charitra chithran ho jaataa he or phir tab adhik sthaayee ilaaj shuru ho sakati he
 Note that these drugs do not treat its long-term effects due to hyperthyroidism or non-treatment, but only treat or alleviate the symptoms of the condition
 thyroid hormone ke utpaadan par kuch alpatam prabhaav tathaapi propranolol se bhi aata he -jiskaa atigalagranthita ke upachaar main do bhoomikaayen hoti hai, jo propranolol ke alag samavayavi padaarth dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 L-propranolol is the cause of beta-inhibition, so it treats symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism such as tremor, palpitations, rash, and heat intolerance
 di-propranolol thyroxin deodinage kaa avrodh karata he, is tarah T3 main T4 ke roopantaran ko avaruddh karke kuch, haalanki alpatam prabhaav pradaan karata he
 Other beta blockers are used only to treat symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism
 america main propranolol or britain main metoprolol kaa istemaal aksar atigalagranthi ke marijon ke ilaaj main vruddhi karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Premature surgery is an option for reduced use of invasive radio isotopic therapy, but is still needed in cases where the thyroid gland is enlarged and causes pressure on the neck, or the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism
 Essentially cancer-related
 surgery kaa prayog vyapak rup se nahin kiya jaataa he, kyonki atigalagranthita ke sabase aam roopon kaa bahut prabhavakaari ilaaj radiodharmee iodine paddati dwaara kiya jaataa he or chunki parathyroid grathiyon ko nikaalane or aavartak laringial tantrika ke kaate jane se niglana mushkil ho jaataa he or kisi badi surgery se yahaan tak ki samanyikrut stavakgolanu sankraman ho saktaa he
 Some Graves' disease patients, however, can tolerate medications for this or that reason, patients who are allergic to iodine, or patients who refuse radioiodine may opt for surgery
 iske alaava, kuch sarjanon kaa maananaa he ki asaamaanya rup se badi granthi vaale, yaa jinaki ankhen kotor se baahar nikali hui hon, aise marijon ke liye radioiodine upachaar asurakshit he; bhay he ki radioiodine 131 kii bahut adhik khuraaq se marij ke lakshan bad ja sakate hai
 In iodine-131 radio isotopic therapy, radioactive iodine-131 is given through the mouth for one time to prevent or completely destroy the function of the hyperactive thyroid gland
 The isotopic use of this radioactive iodine for ablation treatment is more potent than clinical radioiodine, which has a biological half-life of 8–13 hours
 iodine-131, jo bhi beta kanon ko samaapt karata he jo simit kshetra main utakon ke liye kahin adhik nuksaankaree he, kaa lagbhag 8 dinon kaa arddh-jivan hota he
 Patients who are not affected by the first dose are sometimes given additional, larger doses of radio iodine
 is ilaaj main iodine-131 ko thyroid main sakriy koshikaon dwaara uthaa liya jaataa he or unhen nasht kar detaa he, thyroid granthi ko zyaadaatar yaa puri tarah se niskriy bana detaa he
 Since iodine is easily ingested by thyroid cells and even more readily by overactive thyroid cells, sleep destruction occurs locally and does not have widespread side effects of this therapy
 50 varshon se radioiodine anshochhedan kaa prayog ho rahaa he or iskaa upyog nahin karne kii ekmaatr badi vajah hai garbhavastha or stanpan 
 ek baar jab thyroid granthi niskriy bana di jaati he, tab sharir kii thyroid hormone kii maatra kii zarurat ko puraa karne ke liye pratidin munh ke jariye pratisthaapan hormone chikitsa aasaani se di ja sakati he
 However, a skewed study notes that the incidence of cancer was seen after radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism
 atigalagranthita ke liye radioiodine upachaar kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki aushadhi chikitsa kii tulana main isamen safalataa dar bahut adhik he
 Depending on the dose of radioiodine selected and the disease being treated, the success rate of the definitive solution for hyperthyroidism may vary from 75–100%
 grevs rogiyon main radioiodine kaa ek pramukh sambhavit dushprabhav ke rup main jivan bhar ke liye avatu-alpakriyata kaa vikaas he, jiske liye pratidin thyroid hormone ke ilaaj kii zarurat he
 Occasionally, some patients may require more than one radioactive treatment, depending on the type of disease, the size of the thyroid and the initial administered dose given
 anek rogi pehle is baat se dukhi hote hai ki unhen jivan bhar thyroid hormone kii goli leni padegi
 phir bhi, thyroid hormone surakshit, saste or aasaani se nigal lene vaale hote hai; or hormone thyroid ke jaise hote hai tathaa saamanytah thyroid dwaara hi bane hote hai; aam taur par yah chikitsa bahut adhikansh rogiyon ke liye atyant surakshit or bahut hi sahneeya he
 The destruction of thyroid tissue as a result of radioactive iodine treatment, often leads to a moving period of several days to weeks when symptoms of hyperthyroidism may actually worsen after radioactive iodine treatment
 thyroid hormone yukt thyroid koshikaon ke radiodharmee iodine-janit vinaash ke baad rakt main thyroid hormone ke jari hone se aamtaur par aisa hota he
 In some patients, drug treatments such as beta blockers may be useful in this period
 anek rogi shuruuaati kuch saptaah ko bina kisi samasya ke bardaasht karne main samarth hote hai
 Most patients did not experience any difficulty after radioactive iodine treatment, usually given as a small pill
 agar thyroid main halki sujan viksit ho or gardan yaa kanth kshetra main pareshaani paidaa kar rahi ho to kabhi-kabhi, kuch dinon baad gardan sukumaartha yaa gale kaa shoth prakat ho ja saktaa he
 It is usually temporary and is not associated with fever etc
 radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke baad jo mahilaayein stanpan karaati hai unhen kam se kam ek saptaah or sambhawatah adhik samay tak ke liye stanpan karana band kar dena chahie, kyonki radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke kai saptaah baad bhi radiodharmee iodine kii kuch maatra stan ke doodh main paayi ja sakati he
 a common result after radioiodine is hyperthyroidism, a change from thyroid dysfunction to easily treatable thyroiditis and 78% of those treating Graves' thyrotoxicosis, and 40% of those treated with polycystic gland, or toxic gland tumors alone
 it happens
 radioiodine kii badi khuraaq kaa prayog upachaar vifaltaa kii ghatnaon ko kam kar detaa he, ilaaj ke ucch pratisaad ke liye harjane ke rup main falswaroop avatu-alpakriyata kii oonchi dar adhikanshtah shaamil he, jiskaa hormone ilaaj jivan bhar karnaa padataa he
 Ultrasound scans showed increased sensitivity to the thyroid more uniformly than radioiodine therapy, which is due to the large cells that are converted to 81% hypothyroid, which is 37% higher than the normal scan appearance

 There are the same three treatment options used for humans in cats' hyperthyroidism
 Cats must be given medication for the rest of their lives, but less expensive options may be given to especially older cats
 radioiodine upachaar or surgery aksar atigalagranthita ko thik kar detii hai
 Some veterinarians prefer radio iodine treatment rather than surgery, as it does not carry the risk associated with anesthesia
 haalanki, billiyon ke liye radioiodine upachaar sabhi kshetron main uplabdh nahin he
 The reason for this is that this treatment requires nuclear radioactive expertise and facilities, since animals' urine, sweat, saliva, and feces remain radioactive for several days after radioactive treatment, so they usually have a total of three weeks
 Like an intimate patient, it is necessary to be kept in the hospital and needs its facilities
 Guidelines for radiation levels differ in different states; Some states, such as Massachusetts, are sent home with care instructions after being hospitalized for two days
 thyroid grathiyon main se ek ke prabhavit hone ke baad surgery kii ja sakati he; lekin surgery ke baad baaqi granthiyaan ati-sakriy ho ja sakati hai
 As far as people are concerned, one of the most common complications of surgery is vertigo

 When hyperthyroidism appears in dogs, it is due to over-supplementation of thyroid hormones during treatment with hypothyroidism
 lakshan aamtaur par gaayab ho jate hai jab khuraaq samyojit kii jaati he
 Sometimes dogs develop functional carcinoma in the thyroid; Mostly this is a very aggressive tumor that spreads very rapidly and translocates easily or spreads to other tissues and makes the prior diagnosis very weak
 jabaki surgery sambhav he, lekin yah aksar bahut kathin ho jaati he kyonki dhamniyon, grasanalee or shwaasanlee sahit utakon ke aas-paas punj failte jate hai
 It is possible to do this only to reduce the size of the mass, in this way, you will get relief from symptoms and get time for other treatment works
 yadi kisi kute ko saumy kriyaatmak carcinoma he, upachaar or rog kaa nidaan nahin kii he ki billi se alag he
 The only real difference is that dogs are asymptomatic, with the exception of an enlarged thyroid gland appearing as a sphere in the neck

 ‘manusmriti’ bhartiya samskruti kaa abhinn ang he
 It is counted in such texts of the world, from which humans have gained inspiration for personal behavior and society
 isamen prashn keval dharmik aasthaa yaa vishwaas kaa nahin he
 Every social person has this expectation and aspiration to meet the needs of human life, in any way, by mutual cooperation and in an elegant way
 videshon main is vishay par paryaapt khoj hui he, tulanaatmak adhyayan hua he or samalochanaayen bhi hui hai
 Its place in Hindu society is after Vedatrayi
 manusmriti ke bahut se sanskaran uplabdh hai
 In time, many interpolations are also natural
 saadhaaran vyakti ke liye yah sambhav nahin he ki vah baad main sammilit hue anshon kii pahchaan kar sake
 Only an official scholar can do this after comparative studies
 antoni read kehete hai ki burma, thailand, cambodia, java-bali aadi main dharamshastron or pramukhtah manusmriti, kaa bada aadar tha
 In these countries, these texts were considered to be natural laws and the kings were expected to conduct themselves accordingly
 in granthon kaa pratilipikaran kiya gaya, anuwaad kiya gaya or sthaneey kanoonon main inako sammilit kar liya gaya
 a book memorial called 'bible in India' Louis Jacquilot writes: manusmriti ke kaal evam praneta ke vishay main naveen anusandhankaree vidwaanon ne paryaapt vichaar kiya he
 Some people believe that this memory was named Manusmriti, because it was active in the "human" stage
 koi kehete hai ki manusmriti se pehle koi 'maanav dharmasutra' tha jiskaa aashray lekar kisi ne ek mul manusmriti banaai thi jo baad main upbrunhit hokar vartmaan rup main prachlit ho gai
 Many answers of Manusmriti are considered even when considering for them many of the ideas or sentences which are not found in ancient texts like Nirukta, Mahabharata etc
 is prakaar ke anek tathyon kaa boohaler, pandurang vaaman kane aadi vidwaanon ne paryaapt vivechan kiya he
 It seems quite logical that the theological sentences with the name of Manu were prevalent in the society, whose instructions are in the Mahabharata etc
 and the words of which the present Manushahita was taken by taking shelter, as well as the name of an ancient sage named Bhrigu for fame
 Added to it
 manu se pehle bhi dharamshastrakaar the, yah manu ke "ete" aadi shabdon se hi gyaat hua he
 Kautilya mentions "manavaah"
 vidwaanon ke anusaar manu parampara kii pracheenta hone par bhi vartmaan manusmriti isa purv chaturth shatabdi se pracheen nahin ho sakati, yah baat yavan, shaq, kamboj, china aadi jatiyon ke nirdesh se gyaat hoti he
 It is also certain that the present form of memory had become strong by the second century BCE and no rites were performed after this period
 manusmriti bhartiya aachaar-samhita kaa vishwakosh he, manusmriti main baarah adhyay tathaa do hajaar paanch sau shloke hai, jinamein sristi kii utpatti, sanskaar, nity or naimitthik karm, ashramadharm, varndharm, rajdharm va praayshchit aadi vishyon kaa ullekh he

 There are many beautiful things in Manusmriti, from personal mindfulness to the whole social system, which can guide us even today
 janm ke aadhaar par jati or varna kii vyavastha par sabase pehali chot manusmriti main hi kii gai he 
 It is also a matter of education for all and to receive the most education
 striyon kii puja karne arthath unhen adhikadhik sammaan dene, unhen kabhi shok na dene, unhen hameshaa prasann rakhane or sampatti kaa vishesh adhikaar dene jaisi baaten bhi hai 
 The king has been told not to force the subjects to do anything
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki praja ko hameshaa nirbhayata mahasoos honi chahie 
 There has been talk of non-violence towards everyone
 manu par kai vyakhyaayein prachlit hai- The names of many commentators of Manu are known, whose commentaries are now extinct, such as - helpless, Bhartriyajna, Yajva, Upadhyaya Riju, Vishnuswamy, Udayakar, Bharuchi or Bhaguri, Bhojdev Dharanidhar etc
 bharat main vedon ke uparant sarvaadhik manyata or prachlan ‘manusmriti’ kaa hi he
 In this, apart from the four varnas, the four ashrams, sixteen rites and the creation of creation, the system of the state, the king's duty, all kinds of disputes, the management of the army, etc
 have been consulted on all those topics which are possible in the life of human beings
 All this religion is based on the Vedas
 manu maharaj ke jivan or unke rachanakaal ke vishay main itihaas-puraana spasht nahin hai
 However, everyone accepts with one voice that Manu was a primitive man and his scripture is Adi Shastra
 kyonki manu kii samast manyataayen satya hone ke saath-saath desh, kaal tathaa jati bandhanon se rahit hai

 main is baat par jor dena chaahunga ki hamaari sarkaar aise aarthik prabandhan kii vyavastha srujit karne ke liye vachanabaddh he jisase rojgaar ke zyada avasar paidaa honge
 But employment opportunities can come only when the economy is expanding and expanding enough
 pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan ham vikaas kii dar tej karne main safal hue hai hamaari mahatvakanksha he ki desh ke shramik or udyog maalik milakar kaam karen taaki vikaas kii kam se kam 9 pratishat dar praapt kii ja sake
 With such a growth rate, we can hope that the country will be able to get rid of poverty, ignorance and diseases which are still holding crores of people in their clutches
 mujhe ummid he ki aap in muddon par vichaar-vimarsh karenge
 i understand that the agenda of this conference includes employment and employment eligibility as a subject
 yah aisa kshetra hai jise main bahut mahatvapurn maanata hum
 We need to provide employment opportunities to a large number of youth who join the workforce every year
 yuvakon ke rojgaar dena hamaari sarkaar kii sarvocch praathamikta vaale agenda main shaamil he
 This can only happen when we equip our youth with the skills that are in demand in a rapidly growing economy
 bhartiya arth vyavastha kii 2004 se tej pragati ne kaushal vikaas kii prakriya kii khaamiyon ko ujagar kar diya he
 Today, the availability of skills is probably the most important obstacle that is hindering industrial development

 Many times the idea is expressed that Indian labor policies unnecessarily protect the interests of existing working workers against employment expansion in the organized sector
 haalanki haal ke varshon main yah vichaardhaara dhoomil ho rahi he kyonki zyada se zyada rajya sarkarein shram kshetra ke navinikaran or punargathan ke liye lacheela rukh apana rahi hai
 Our government is committed to protecting the interests of our workers, we must also keep from time to time noting whether some part of our regulatory framework is unnecessarily hindering employment, enterprise and industry without contributing to labor welfare

 Women are the parts of our country that are not used properly

 haalanki manaregaa sahit hamaare niaman main crechon kii sthapana kaa praavdhaan shaamil kiya gaya he lekin saaf taur par yah kaaphi nahin he
 We also need to make provision for part-time work that has characteristics similar to full-time employment
 iske liye yadi kanoon main badlaav kii zaroorat ho to hamen iske liye taiyaar rahanaa he or ise vaastavikta banane ke liye iske khaake par kaary shuru kar dena chahie
 Another issue that i would like to raise is the workers moving from one place to another in relation to work
 aise shramikon ke kalyaan or behatari ko sunishchit karne ke liye vartmaan main hamaari pranali adhik majboot nahin he
 In this connection, we need to strengthen it with our knowledge, wisdom and experience

 Tara is the wife of Vanararaj Vali in the Hindu epic Ramayana
 tara kii budhimata, pratyutpannamatitvata, saahas tathaa apane pati ke prati kartavyanishtha ko sabhi puranic granthon main saraahaa gaya he
 Tara is considered by the Hindu religion to be one of the Panchakanyaas
 puranic granthon main panchakanyaon ke vishay main kaha gaya he:- Ahilya Draupadi Kunti Tara Mandodari and
 panchakanya smaranityan mahapatak naashak
 Though Tara is portrayed only three places in the Valmiki Ramayana in the lead role, her character has left an indelible impression in the minds of those who understand the Ramayana story
 jin teen jagah tara kaa charitra mukhya bhoomika main he, vah is prakaar hai:- According to some texts, she was the granddaughter of Jupiter, the guru of the gods
 ek katha ke anusaar samudr manthan ke dauraan chaudaa maniyon main se ek apsaraayen thim
 One of those nymphs was Tara
 wali or sushen donon manthan main devatagan kii madad kar rahe the
 When they saw Tara, both of them vied to make her a wife
 wali tara ke dahini taraf tathaa sushen uske baayin taraf khadey ho gaye
 Then Vishnu decided that at the time of marriage, the girl is her husband on the right side and the father who gives the bride on the left side
 atah wali tara kaa pati tathaa sushen uskaa pita ghoshit kiye gaye
 On Rama's assurance that Rama would kill the Vali himself, Sugriva challenged the Vali
 wali lalkaar sunakar baahar aayaa
 There was a fierce battle between the two, but because both brothers had the same face and body composition, Rama did not shoot his arrow due to confusion
 antatah wali ne sugriv ko buree tarah parrast karke dur khaded diya
 Frustrated, Sugreev again came to Rama
 ram ne is baar lakshmana se sugriv ke gale main maala pehanaane ko kaha jisase vah dwandv ke dauraan sugriv ko pahchaanane main galati nahin karenge or sugriv se wali ko pun: lalkaarane ko kaha
 Sugriva went to Kishkindha and again challenged Vali to a duel
 jab wali ne dobaaraa sugriv kii lalkaar suni to uske krodh kaa thikaana na rahaa
 Tara might have realized that Sugriva enjoys Rama's patronage because Sugriva alone does not dare to dare him again
 atah kisi anhoni ke bhay se tara ne wali ko saavdhaan karne kii cheshtaa kii
 He even said that after declaring Sugriva as the prince of Kishkindha, he should make a treaty with him
 kintu wali ne is shaq se ki tara sugriv kaa anuchit paksh le rahi he, use dutkaar diya
 But he assured Tara that he would not kill Sugriva and would only teach him a good lesson
 aisi manyata he ki ram ne wali par jo tir chalaaya tha vah ek saadhaaran tir tha, arthath ram ke tarkash main anekanek astr the jinase pal bhar main jeev to kya puri kii puri sabhyataa kaa vinaash ho saktaa tha, jaise brahmastra ityadi
 But Maryada Purushottam Rama - who was an avatar of Vishnu and omniscient - shot a simple arrow because Vali does not die instantly and before he dies, he must get the answer to his questions so that he can die in peace He was able to meet his relatives well before dying
 wali ke aahat hone kaa samachar sunakar tara apane putr angad ke saath ranbhumi kii taraf bhaagi
 On the way, he finds the apes fleeing from Rann, who advised him to go back to Kishkindha with Angad and coronate Angad and avoid the wrath of Rama
 lekin tara ne us vanar samooh ko apane saath kiya or maranasann wali kii ore prasthaan kiya
 Going there, the lamentation of Tara is very important in front of the person, because no other creature besides humans mourns so much after the death of his or her own family
 pehle to tara marate hue wali ko ang lagaati he, uske pashchaat sugriv tathaa ram ko vah khari khoti sunaati he
 Hanuman intervenes and helps Tara and explains philosophy to her
 yah ek anoothaa sandarbh he ki tara ne wali kii chita main apane bhi praan tyaagane kaa sankalp liya
 This means that the practice of sati has been prevalent in our society since ancient times
 is sandarbh main itnaa hi kahana uchit hoga ki vilaap ke samay usne jo vachan kahe vah koi saadhaaran nari nahin bol sakati he
 He had a good knowledge of politics and diplomacy, and for this reason, despite the apes of the monkeys, he nominated Sugriva as king, not to crown Angad
 apane putr par koi aanch na aane paye, is kaaran usne sugriv ko apana swami sweekaar kar liya
 After Vali's slaughter, Tara thought it appropriate to accept Sugriva as the lord because he had to protect Angad's interests as well
 jab sugriv rajollas main tallin ho gaya or ram ko sita kaa dhundne kaa vachan bhul gaya to ram ne lakshmana ko use apana vachan yaad karaane ko bheja
 Laxman was quite angry anyway
 unhone kiskindha kii rajdhani pampapur main lagbhag akraman bol diya
 Sugriva realized his mistake but did not dare to face Laxman
 usne tara se aagrah kiya ki vah lakshmana ko shant kar de
 Madonmutt came out of Tara Ranivas and calmed Lakshmana
 usne maharishi vishwamitra kaa udhaaharan diya ki aise mahatma bhi indriya vishyak bhogon ke aage laachaar ho gaye the phir sugriv kii to bisaat hi kya or yah bhi ki vah manushya nahin varan ek vanar he
 Tara also described that Sugriva sent messengers to gather forces in all four directions
 valmiki ramayana tathaa anya bhashaaon ke roopantaranon main yah ullekh he ki adhkhule nayanon vaali madonmatta tara ke tarkon ko sunakar lakshmana thodi shant ho gaye or uske pashchaat sugriv ke aagaman or usase sita ko khojane kaa aashwaasan paakar waapas chale gaye
 Some regional adaptations of the Ramayana also show that at the time when Lakshman raged in the palace of the palace of the capital of Kishkindha, his first wife, Ruma, who was drinking with Sugriva, was not Tara and Bhoga Vilas
 He was engrossed in both
 yahan par yah yaad dilaanaa uchit hoga ki ram se maitri karte samay sugriv ne apane rajya ke chhin jane se bhi adhik wali dwaara apni patni rumaa ke chhin jane kaa khed prakat kiya tha
 But after getting a partner like Tara, Sugriva also forgot his beloved wife Ruma
 ramayana ke kai roopantaranon main yah ullekh aayaa he ki jab mayavi se yuddh karte samay wali ko kaafii samay biit gaya or sugriv ne kandara ke muhane main ek shila lagaakar uskaa dwaar band kar diya or kiskindha waapas aakar is baat kii soochna mantriyon ko di ki shaayad wali mayavi ke haathon maaraa gaya he, to mantranaa karke mantriyon ne sugriv ko kiskindha kaa raja chunaa or prakat rup se vidhwaa hui tara apane pati ke chote bhai kii patni sweekrut hui
 This practice is neither given the status of sin in the Valmiki Ramayana nor in its regional converts
 lekin jab wali mayavi kaa vadh karke waapas kiskindha aata he or krodh ke kaaran sugriv ko desh-nikaala detaa he or uski patni rumaa ko hadap letaa he to kiskindhakand main sugriv-ram milaap ke dauraan ram ise ghor paap kii sangya dete hai
 Even after Vali's slaughter, Tara became Sugriva's wife again
 shaayad us kaal ke samaaj main bahu-patni tathaa bahu-pati pratha kaa chalan sweekaarya rahaa ho
