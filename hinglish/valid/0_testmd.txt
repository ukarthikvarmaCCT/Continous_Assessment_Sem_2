 sarvapratham manchuriya kii samasya ne rus tathaa japan main ek-duusare ke prati ghrinaa kii bhaavana ko janm diya, jiskaa antim parinaam yuddh ke rup main hua
 The northern region of China is called 'manchuria'
 aarthik sadhano kii drushti se yah kshetra bahut sampann he
 Coal, iron and gold are found here in abundance
 aise kshetra par prabhutv sthaapan ke liye rus or japan ke bich sangharsh hona swaabhaavik tha
 Russia wanted to bring this territory under its influence and for this it had many schemes
 1894 i
 ke baad rus ne china kaa paksh liya tha or japan par prabhaav daalkar liyaotung pradesh se japani adhikaar hataane ke liye japan ko baadhya kiya
 After some time there was a treaty between Russia and China, according to which Russia got the right to lay a thousand miles long rail-line to Bladivostok in Manchuria
 port arthur or uske sameep kaa pradesh pachchis varsh ke liye rus ko patte par mila or yahan roosi sarkaar apane jangi jahaaj surakshit rakhane ke liye kilabandi shuru kar chuki thi
 Port Arthur had become Russia's largest military base in the Pacific Ocean, due to which Russia's power in the region became very strong
 manchuriya main railway line ke nirmaan ke liye do companiyon kaa sanghathan kiya gaya tha, jin par rus kaa niyantran tha
 a bank was established for the financial management of these companies, which was also controlled by Russia
 rail linon ke nirmaan ke liye bahut-se roosi manchuriya main aa rahe the
 To protect these lines, a large army of Russians also started living in this region
 manchuriya main rus ke badhate prabhaav se japan bahut adhik chintit ho rahaa tha
 He did not want Russia to control the region
 japan swayan manchuriya par apana adhikaar kaayam karnaa chahta tha
 This was a very suitable place for the expansion of the Japanese Empire
 china-japan yuddh ke baad japan ke liyaotung pradesh par apana jo adhikaar kaayam kiya tha, uske peeche yahi swaarth chipa hua tha
 However, due to opposition from Russia, Japan had to take suzerainty over the region by accepting amendments to the Treaty of Shimonoseki
 atev, rus or japan ke bich manchuriya par prabhutv sthaapan kii baat ko lekar yuddh avashyambhavi prathit ho rahaa tha
 The other area of conflict between Russia and Japan was Korea
 china-japan yuddh ke baad korea par japan kaa prabhutv kaayam ho sakaa tha
 However, Russia's interference limited Japan's sovereignty to a great extent
 phir bhi japan ne apane prayaas jari rakhe or korea par apana puraa niyantran kaayam karne kii koshish main juta rahaa
 The King of Korea was opposing these efforts of the Japanese
 aisi paristhiti main japani sainikon ne rajmahal par hamalaa kar diya lekin, raja bhaag niklaa or rus kii sena ne use bachaa liya
 Japan was very angry with Russia on this
 1902-03 i
 main rus ne korea main apni kaarywahi or tej kar di
 He captured a Korean port at the mouth of Yalu, built roads from the ports of North Korea to military bases in Manchuria and laid wire lines and tried to get a railroad contract from Seoul to Yahoo
 japan ne iskaa virodh kiya or july, 1903 i
 main rus se duusari sandhi kaa prastaav kiya, jiske anusaar china or korea kii pradeshik akhandta kaa aashwaasan tathaa rus se unmukt dwaar kii niti par chalane kaa vaada maanga
 Also, it was also proposed that the said treaty protect Russia's interest in Manchuria and Japan's special interests in Korea
 kintu, rus ne inhen ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 This conversation continued till January 1904
 12 janvari ko japani samrat ne aakhri sharten rakhin ki yadi rus, china kii pradeshik akhandta maan le or manchuriya main japan tathaa anya deshon ke vaid kaaryon main baadha na daale or korea ke japani hiton main hastkshep na kare to japan manchuriya ko apane prabhaav kshetra se baahar samajhane ko taiyaar he
 When there was no satisfactory answer and the Russian forces continued to gather towards the east, the war became inevitable
 is yuddh kii visheshta yah thi ki ek purvi shakti dwaara ek mahaan europea shakti kii paraajay hui
 In May, 1904, a fierce war took place between the two sides
 japaniyon ne oktober main das dinon tak sha-ho main bhayankar raktapaat kiya
 Port Arthur was in siege of Japan for a long time
 farvari, 1905 i
 main mukaden kaa kathin yuddh hua
 In the end, the Japanese succeeded and Russia had to leave Mukden
 manchuriya ne bhi japan kaa prabhutv sweekaar kar liya
 There was no war at the site after the victory of Mukden, as the resources of Japan were reduced and Russia's courage was defeated
 rus or japan ke yuddh kaa nirnaayak morcha samudri yuddh tha
 Twelve thousand out of eighteen thousand Russian sailors went to this
 japan ke keval ek sau chhattis aadmi maare gaye
 The military power of the Russians was shattered
 tatpashchaat america raashtrapati roosevelt kii madhyasthta se donon pakshon ke madhya sandhi ho gai
 This is called the 'treaty of Portsmouth'
 5 sitambar, 1905 i
 ko portsmouth main hui sandhi ke anusaar nimnlikhit baaten tay kii gayi - The defeat of Russia paved the way for the development of Japanese imperialism
 purvi asia kii raajnneetik main vah ek kadam or aage bad gaya
 Japan's victory in the russo-japanese War gave Japan a good opportunity to enter Chinese territory
 jabaki purvi asia main rus kaa vistaar ruuk gaya
 Manchuria had the right to his name
 yuddh main japan ne siddh kar diya ki vah sansar kaa ek shaktishaalee raashtra he
 On this basis, he requested Britain to make such amendments to the anglo-japanese Treaty, which would give Japan some more benefit
 isse bhi mahatvapurn baat yah thi ki korea par se rus ke prabhaav kaa ant ho gaya
 Now Japan could operate in Korea as she wished
 avasar paakar 1910 i
 main usne korea ko apane samrajya main shaamil kar liya
 Thus, the russo-japanese War contributed to the task of incorporating Korea into the Japanese Empire
 samooche sansar main, visheshkar purvi asia main, japan kii khyaati bad gai
 The enthusiasm of Japan increased greatly and after victory in the war he adopted a fierce imperialist policy, which resulted in the establishment of his vast empire
 rajbhavan jammu bharat ke jammu or kashmir rajya ke rajyapal kaa adhikarik sheetakaaleen awaas he
 It is located in the winter capital of the state, Jammu

 The Raj Bhavan of Jammu was one of the many palaces of the Maharaja there, Ranbir Mahal, which is currently under the tenure of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir

 saadhaaran bolchaal kii bhashaa main karm kaa arth hota he 'kriya'
 In grammar, karma is the shelter of the performing fruit from the verb
 "ram ghar jaataa he' is udhaaharan main "ghar" gaman kriya ke fal kaa aashray hone ke naate "janaa kriya' kaa karm he
 In philosophy, karma is used in a special sense
 jo kuch manushya karata he usase koi fal utpann hota he
 This fruit is auspicious, inauspicious or different from both
 fal kaa yah rup kriya ke dwaara sthir hota he
 Donation is auspicious, but violence is inauspicious
 yahan karm shabd kriya or fal donon ke liye prayukt hua he
 This is based on the feeling that the verb is always attached to the fruit
 kriya se fal avashya utpann hota he
 It should be noted here that the natural actions of the body are not included in it
 aankh kii palkon kaa uthanaa, girnaa bhi kriya he, parantu isse fal nahin utpann hota
 This type of action has no significance in the range of philosophy because that action is not motivated by mind
 ukt saamaanya niyam man:prerit kriyaaon main hi lagu hota he
 Deliberately donating or killing someone is worthwhile
 parantu anjaane main kisi kaa upkaar dena athwa kisi ko haani pahunchaana kya karm kii uktaparidhi main nahin aata? kanoon main kaha jaataa he ki niyam kaa agyaan manushya ko kriya ke fal se nahin bachaa saktaa
 The Gita also says that the auspicious inauspicious fruit of karma must be eaten, it is not relieved
 is sthiti main jane-anjaane main kii gai kriyaaon kaa shubh-ashubh fal hota hi he
 About unconscious actions, it is said that ignorance is the fault of the doer and the doer is responsible for that defect
 karta ko kriya main pravrutt hone ke pehle kriya se sambandhit sabhi baton kaa pataa laga lenaa chahie
 The distinction of many actions in ignorance from natural actions is only in that natural actions happen on their own without the help of the mind, but ignorant actions do not happen on their own - they have a hand in the mind
 na chaahate hue bhi aankh kii palken girengi, par na chaahate hue agyaan main koi kriya nahin kii ja sakati he
 The result of a verb is different from the purpose of the action, yet the action is not necessarily done
 at: karm kii paridhi main ve kriyaayein or fal aate hai jo swaabhaavik kriyaaon se bhinn hai
 The relation of verb and fruit is based on the unbreakable rule of action-cause-emotion
 yadi kaaran vidyaman he to kaary avashya hoga
 This natural law is also true in the field of conduct
 at: kaha jaataa he ki kriya kaa karta fal kaa avashya bhokta hota he
 Buddhists consider the doer to be ephemeral, but to illustrate this rule, he assumes a kind of uniformity in the moment, saying that one person's child is different from another person's child
 kshanbhed hone se bhi vyaktitv main bhed nahin hota; at: vyakti purvanishpadit kriya kaa uttar kaal main bhoga karata hi he
 If we do not believe this, then we have to say that there is some other enjoyment of the fruit of the action done by someone who is against logic
 yadi is niyam par purna aasthaa ho to tark hamen iske ek anya nishkarsh ko bhi sweekaar karne ke liye baadhya karata he
 If all the actions have to bear the fruit, then what will happen to those actions whose subject dies before it is consumed? Either we have to abandon the principle of karma or else, believe that the doer does not die, he only changes the body
 bhartiya vichaarkon ne ek swar se doosraa paksh hi sweekaar kiya he
 They say that dying is the natural karma of the body, but it is not necessary for enjoyment that the body is the one who has done the action
 bhokta alag he or vah karmfal kaa bhoga karne ke liye doosraa sharir dhaaran karata he
 This is called rebirthism
 mrityu sharir kii aanushanbik swaabhaavik kriya he jiskaa karm par koi prabhaav nahin hota
 Therefore, the principle of karma cannot be kept separate from rebirth
 itnaa hi nahin, jab kriya kaa sambandh falbhog ke saath mana jaataa he tab yah bhi maananaa padegaa ki bhoga-jo shubh ashubh karmon ke anusaar sukhmay yaa du:khamay hota he-avashyambhavi he
 It cannot be avoided, neither can it be changed
 fal ke kshay kaa ekmaatr upaay he usko bhoga lenaa
 In this birth, just like a creature is only the result of the actions of its previous lives
 fal ek shakti he jo jivan kii sthiti ko niyantrit karti he
 The strength of this power is also called karma and some people also call it fate or destiny
 niyatwaad main mana gaya he ki praani niyati se niyantrit at: paravash he
 He himself does nothing
 parantu purvajanmon kii kriya kaa fal bhogane ke alaava vah is janm main swatantra karta bhi he, at: purv karmon ko bhogane ke saath hi vah bhavishya ke liye karm karata he
 In this, he has independence
 aachaar ke liye swatantraaa paramaavashyak he or praaia: sabhi bhartiya darshanik ise maanate hai
 The verb, the verb and the group of the verb, also known as the unseen, is known in Indian philosophy by the word karma
 pehle kaha gaya he ki man:prerana karm kaa aavashyak upkaran he
 Mind: Karma is auspicious or inauspicious only because of the auspicious or inauspicious
 doctor rogi kii bhalaai ke liye uski cheerfaad karata he
 If the patient suffers from this incision, then the doctor is not responsible for it
 doctor shubh karm kar rahaa he
 Therefore, grief, which is the result of the action done by an inauspicious mind, can be overcome only when the mind is saved from inauspicious effects
 sarvada shubh karm karnaa sarvada shubh sochane se hi ho saktaa he
 This is the only way to avoid suffering
 parantu shubh karm karanevaale vyakti ko falbhog ke liye janm lenaa hi hoga, chaahe swarg main, chaahe prithvi par
 Taking birth in itself is a great pain because birth is related to death
 mrityu kaa ksht du:sah ksht mana gaya he
 Therefore, if we want to get rid of this problem, then the tradition of birth will also have to end
 iske liye shubh karmon kaa bhi parityag aavashyak he kyonki bina uske janm se mukti nahin he
 Therefore, only good abandonment can be free of real sorrow
 kya shubhashubh parityag sambhav he? sharir rahete yah sambhav nahin maaloom hota
 But there is a solution
 man ke shodhan se yah siddh ho saktaa he
 If all the actions are done naturally without the desire for any fruit in the mind, like falling in the eyelid, then they will not produce good inauspicious results and will also get rid of birth death
 nishkaam karm kaa yahi adarsh he
 On the contrary, all actions - which are auspicious and inauspicious - are weak actions and are due to bondage
 karm ke is siddhant ke saath swarg-narak kii kalpanaayen bhi judi hai
 Auspicious deeds result in the attainment of complete heaven through gross pleasures
 iske vipareet narak kii prapti hoti he
 Even in heaven hell, according to the amount of auspicious inauspicious actions, many levels have been considered, just as there are many levels on earth
 karm ke siddhant ko maanane par swarg narak kii kalpana ko bhi maananaa aavashyak ho jajinhen ham shubh karm kehete hai ve punya tath ashurbh karm paap kehalaate hai
 Virtue and sin mainly reflect the fruits of action
 ye karm teen prakaar ke haate hai
 Routines are those who cause sin if they do not do it, but they do not produce anything if they do
 naimitthik karm karne se punya tathaa na karne se paap hota he
 Kamya karmas are done with the desire, so by doing them, the fruit is accomplished
 na karne se kuch bhi nahin hota
 Since there is a hidden purpose in all three actions that virtue should be earned, to stay away from sin, all these actions are motivated by mind
 janm se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye nity, naimitthik or kamya karmon kaa parityag atyant aavashyak mana gaya he
 The main eight distinctions of Karma are described in Jain philosophy - dhakad chhora bhartiya hariyaanvi chalchitr he jisamen mukhya bhoomika main uttar kumaar evam suman negi hai

 Survival skills or survival skills are techniques that a person can use to protect themselves or others in a dangerous situation
 Generally speaking, these techniques help in fulfilling the basic requirements of human life: water, food, shelter, housing
 ye takneekein vyakti ko sidhe sochane main, madad ke sanket dene main, surakshapurvak nevigate karne main, jaanwaron or paudhon ke saath hone vaali apriy ghatnaon ko rokane main or praathmik chikitsa uplabdh karaane main bhi madad karti hai
 Survival skills are often basic ideas and abilities that have been used by ancient humans for thousands of years, so these skills are partly a repeat of history
 inamen se adhikansh kaushal aise tareeke hai jinase sudur sthanon main ek vistrut samay avadhi kaa anand uthaaya ja saktaa he yaa prakruti kaa saamana kiya ja saktaa he
 Some people use these skills to appreciate nature and to rebuild, not just for survival
 kisi sanrachana kaa nirmaan karne se pehle aap ko apni sthiti par vichaar karnaa chahie
 aapkaa aashray is prakaar kaa ho jo aapke chaaron or maujuud garmi, hawa, varsha, barf or mausam se aapako surakshit rakh sake
 aashray pramukh rup se suraksha or aaraam uplabdh karata he, isamen mausam, jaanwaron or keedon se suraksha shaamil he
 It should be relatively comfortable so that you can sleep in it, because sleeping is a basic requirement of humans
 ek aashray ek "prakritik awaas" ho saktaa he; jaise ek gupha, yaa ek gira hua ghanaa ped 
yah maanav nirmit aashray kaa madhyavarti rup ho saktaa he jaise malbe se banaaya gaya awaas, lakdi ke gatthar ke paas khodi gayi ek khai jise patton ityadi se dhak diya gaya ho, yaa ek barf kii gupha
 yah puri tarah se maanav nirmit saranchana ho sakati he jaise tarp, tent, yaa ghar
 It is believed that the ability to make fire helped to increase the survival ability of man physically and mentally
 Fire using natural flint or steel and tinder without lighters or matches is a common theme of books on survival
 jangal main kaam karne se pehle aag lagane kii kushalta ke abhyaas par bal diya jaataa he
 The fire was presented as a device that met many of the survival requirements
 aag se utpann ushma sharir ko garmi detii he, geele kapadon ko sukhaati he, pani ko ni:sankramit karti he or bhojan ko pakaati he
 The sense of security and protection provided by it and psychological sensibilities should not be ignored
 In the forest, fire gives a sense of home, a central point in addition to an additional energy source
 aag ek junglee jaanavar ke dwaara uttarajive ke jivan main kiye jane vale hastkshep ko roak sakati he, haalanki junglee jaanavar aag kii ushma yaa prakaash se aakarshith ho sakate hai
 The light and smoke generated by the fire can also be used to work at night and to signal rescue units
 ek manushya bina pani ke ausatan chaar se paanch dinon tak jivit rah saktaa he, is sthiti main aisa mana gaya he ki samudr tal kaa str, kamare kaa taapmaana or saapekshik ardrata saamaanya he
 When the temperature is relatively low or high, the need for water increases
 vyaayaam ke dauraan bhi pani kii zarurat bad jaati he
 Under normal circumstances, at least two to four liters of water per day is lost from the body of a common person
 garm, shushk yaa thande mausam main yah maatra bad jaati he
 Six liters of water or any other liquid is required daily to protect a person from dehydration
 tabhi uskaa sharir thik prakaar se kaary kar saktaa he
 According to the handbook of the US Army, you should drink water whenever you feel thirsty
 According to other groups, the determination of water ratio should be consistent with "water discipline"
 pani kii kami se nirjaleekaran ho jaataa he, jiske parinamswaroop vyakti ko susti aati he, uske sar main dard ho saktaa he, use chakkar aane lagate hai, vah bhramit mahasoos karata he or ant main uski mrityu ho sakati he
 Mild dehydration also reduces the capacity and concentration of body fluids, which are dangerous in living conditions and it is necessary to take clear action on them
 gaharaa pilaa yaa bhura mutr nirjaleekaran kaa naidanik suchak he
 To avoid dehydration, drinking water supply is usually preferred and it is ensured that safe drinking water is provided as far as possible
 uttarjivita sahitya ke kai strot or manch tathaa online sandarbh un tareekon ko bataate hai, jinase pani ko sanchit kiya ja saktaa he or uttarjivita kii sthiti main upbhog ke liye use surakshit rup main uplabdh karaayaa ja saktaa he jaise ubaal kar, chaanakar, rasayanon ke dwaara, saura vikiranon / ushma or aswan ke dwaara
 is tarah ke strot aksar khataron kii suchi bhi dete hai jaise pradooshak, sookshm jeev, yaa rogajanak jo pani kii suraksha ko prabhavit karte hai
 It has recently been recognized that boiling or using commercial filters is safer than chemicals, with the exception of chlorine dye oxide
 pani ke liye jarurat se prastut mudde ke anusaar uttarjivita kii sthitiyon main vashpikaran ke dwaara jal kii anaavashyak kshati ko roka janaa chahie
 Thus, to solve these problems, culinary root tubers, fruits, edible mushrooms, edible nuts, edible beans, edible grains or edible leaves, edible moss, edible cacti and algae can be discovered and prepared if needed
 can be done
 
 pattiyon ke apwaad ke saath, in khaadya padaarthon main calories kii maatra apekshaakrit zyada hoti he, ye sharir ko kuch urja pradaan karte hai
 Plants are some of the easiest food sources that can be found in forests, forests or deserts, as they are stable and therefore can be obtained without much effort
 saath hi kuch tippaneekar jaanwaron ko pakadaney, shikaar karne or machhlee pakadaney ke madhyam se jangal main pashu khaadya ko ekatrit karne ke liye aavashyak gyaan, kaushal or upkarnon ke bare main charchaa karte hai
 Some books related to survival promote the "universal Food Ability Test"
 kathith taur par, khaadya padaarthon ko vifaille padaarthon se vibhedit kiya ja saktaa he, iske liye inkaa antargrahan karne se pehle twachaa or mukh par inaki jaanch kii jaati he, iske liye ek nirdhaarit avadhi tak lakshanon kii jaanch kii jaati he
 However, many other experts, including Ray Meyers and John Kalas, reject this method, believing that even small amounts of a "potential food" can be harmful to the body, leading to illness or death
 ek atirikt kadam jo screch test kehalaata he, kaa upyog kabhi kabhi sambhavit khaadya ke moolyankan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Focusing on survival by presumed explorers, The Boy Scots of America specifically discouraged wild foods on land for which knowledge and skills needed existed under survival conditions, reducing risk
 yah dekhte hue ki zyaadaatar logon ke sharir main paryaapt vasa hoti he, ve isaki madad se kai dinon tak jivit rah sakate hai, ve is urja kaa upyog pani, aag or aashray kii prapti ke liye kar sakate hai, yah uplabdh samay or urja kaa behatar upyog he
 First aid helps a person to survive and saves him in times of injuries and illnesses, in the absence of first aid, these injuries and illnesses can also lead to his death
 aam or khatarnaak choton main shaamil hai: Survivors may require the use of first aid material or, if possible, knowledge of essential, natural medicinal properties may also be employed
 kabhi kabhi yah bhi dhyaan rakhana hota he ki ghayal ang ko hilaayaa naa jaye yaa ghayal vyakti ko saavdhaneepurvak upachaar ke liye le jaaya jaye
 In order to achieve the status of survival it is sometimes necessary that the person is carefully transported to a safe place
 Or it may happen that the person has to find a suitable place to wait for rescue
 According to sources, any of these tasks may require a navigation device or skill
 nevigation ke prakaaron main shaamil hai: In the northern hemisphere at midday, the sun is directly south of an observer
 madhyahn ke samay main dakshini golarddh main, surya kisi paryvekshak ke sidhe uttar main hota he
 The mid-day can be calculated by placing a stick or a straight vertical structure in the ground, it should be kept as far as possible at 90 degrees
 And if possible, its shadow should be marked with a stick, rock or any other structure during a period of one day
 Wherever the shadows are smallest during a day period, if you are in the Northern Hemisphere or the direction is South and if you are in the Southern Hemisphere this direction is North
 nevigation main madad karne ke liye compass yaa ilaake kii prakritik suvidhaon kii sahaayta se yah vidhi paryvekshak ko sahi disha gyaat karne main madad karegi
 disha gyaat karne kii yah vidhi tab upyogi nahin hoti jab paryvekshak ko sthaneey paryaavaran ke bare main saadhaaran gyaan na ho 
 Survival training has many components, mental ability and physical fitness are two of these components
 maansik kshamta main ve kushaltaayen shaamil hai jinaki suchi is lekh main di gayi he, saath hi isamen spasht rup se sochane kii kshamta, aatank kaa saamana karne kii kshamta, ek sankat ko sweekaar karne kii kshamta bhi shaamil he
 Physical fitness includes the ability to move a long distance from a bad track in addition to other abilities
 uttarjivita kaushal kaa saidhantik gyaan tabhi upyogi hota he jab ise jangal main prabhavi rup se lagu kiya jaataa he
 Almost all survival skills are environment specific and require training in a particular environment

 Laurence Gonzales tells the story of Julianne Kopke, a teenage girl in her book Deep Survival: Who Leaves, Who Dies Uny, who succumbs to a plane crash in the Amazon jungles
 use koi aupchaarik prashikshan nahin diya gaya hota, usakane keval saamaanya kapadey pahane hote hai, vah kai dinon tak paraseete keedon ke saath jangal main jivit rahati he
 After eleven days, with very little food, she arrives in a slum and falls

 Any of these symptoms increase the likelihood of survival, making it easier

 raja harishchandra apni sau raniyon ke baavjood nissantan tha
 He worshiped the God of Varuna, that if i have a son, i will dedicate the first son to you
 use ek putr kii prapti ho gai, jiskaa naam rohit rakhaa gaya
 But as soon as the king saw the son in a hurry, his intentions were damaged
 vah kisi na kisi bahaane rohit ko varun devtaa ko saunpane kii baat taalata rahaa
 Fearing that the father would not actually offer him to Varun Dev, Rohit ran into the forest and Harishchandra did not fulfill his vow, so Varun cursed him and became ill
 bhagyavash jangal main idhar-udhar ghoomte rohit ko ajigart naamak stri ek garib brahman ke paas le ai
 Rohit told his story to him
 ajigart ke teen bete the - shun:puchh, shun:langool or shun:shape
 Shun: Shep was a middle son and was very intelligent and intelligent since childhood
 ajigart ne laalach main aakar rohit se kaha ki sau gaayon ke badale vah apane ek putr ko bechney ko taiyaar he
 He can save his life by handing over that son to the god Varuna instead
 duusari ore shun:shape ne sochaa, chota bhai maa kaa laadla he, bada bhai pita kaa laadla he, yadi main chalaa jaaun to donon main se kisi ko koi afsos nahin hoga
 So he agreed to go with Rohit himself
 varun dev bhi koi kam lobhi nahin the
 They were happy to think that i am getting a Brahmin boy for my ritual instead of a Kshatriya boy who is superior
 yajna main nar bali kii taiyaari shuru hui, chaar purohiton ko bulaayaa gaya
 Now Shun: Shep had to be tied to the sacrificial pillar
 lekin iske liye un chaaron main se koi taiyaar nahin hua, kyonki shun:shape brahman tha
 Then in exchange for Azigart and hundred cows, he agreed to tie his child to the Yajna pillar
 iske baad shun:shape ko bali dene kii baari ai
 But the priests again refused
 brahman kii hatya koun kare? tab ajigart or ek sau gaayon ke badale apane bete ko kaatane ke liye bhi taiyaar ho gaya
 When Shun: Shep saw that there was no one to save me now, he started the eulogy of Usha Devta
 prayek richa ke saath shun:shape kaa ek-ek bandhan tuutata gaya or antim richa ke saath na keval shun:shape mukt ho gaya, balki raja harishchand bhi shraap mukt ho gaye

 bhartiya samskruti main paidaa hue kisi bhi manushya kaa man yavat jivan trividh eshnaon se baddh – subaddh – rahata he
 This is an undeniable reality

 Out of these three, the distraction is related to the practical life of man-life

 But due to the natural limitations of feminine, man's importance has increased in the society due to being stronger than male and female, and in the world, male dominance has been shaped
 atah manushyamaatr ke man main putraishna jadibhoot ho gai he
 Therefore, the story of Shunshashep in Aitreyabrahman becomes an extremely guide to the masses of daughters-in-law
 
 However, the story of Shunha Sheep is seen from a different perspective
 jaise ki – vedakaal main narmedh yag hote the yaa nahin
 In the Shunashekayana, when it comes to sacrificing a human being to Varunadevata, scholars around the world have made a point of discussion about whether humans were sacrificed in the Vedic yajna-yagadi along with animal sacrifice
 - parantu is aakhyaan main antatogatva koi bhi manushya kaa bali to nahin chadhaaya jaataa he
 Due to this, there is an urgent need for reconsideration
 is shunamshepakhyaan ke prarambh main raja harishchandraji ne naarad ko poocha he ki – gyani evam agyani donon prakaar ke log apane oras putr kii kaamana karte he
 So tell me why you should wish for a son? Giving a solution to this curiosity, Naradji said that the son is also a form of light in the Supreme Vyom
 duusari or, is aakhyaan ke ant main kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi raja ke rajbhishek ke prasang main yah aakhyaan kaa paath karnaa chaiye, evam jisko bhi putr kii kaamana ho in logon ko bhi is aakhyaan kaa shravan karnaa chaiye
 Keeping in view this undertaking and epilogue of Shunha Sheep story, if seen, the story of three sons and three fathers is presented in this story
 jaisaa ki – pratham pita kii baat aisi haih- ikshvakuvansh ke raja harishchandr ko so so patniyaan hote huye bhi ve aputra the
 But behind these hundred-odd marriages, there must have been betrothal as a driving force
 naarad ne putr ke hone se jo jo laabh milte he, usko vistaar se bataaya he
 Hearing him, Harishchandra begs the son from Varun Devata at any cost
 putr ek baar paidaa ho jaay or vah uskaa mukhadarshan karle to vah kritakruty ho jaayegaa
 And after that he is also ready to sacrifice the son to Varun
 harishchandr ko is shart par putr mil gaya
 From the narrative of the narrative presented here, it is known that the malevolence in the human being, it drowns the man in blind faith
 devataaon ko balidaan de kar putr praapt kiya jaataa he – aisa maananaa ek agyaan he
 On the second level, it is seen that after the attainment of son, father Harishchandra also becomes Mohandh and repeatedly stutters with the promise of sacrificing Varuna
 varunadev jab bhi bali maangane ke liye aate he tab ve ek ke baad ek bahaanaa dikhalaate huye apane putr kii bali dene kaa taalte rahete hai
 The second father is Azigart, son of Suyyavas
 vah bechaara bhukh se peedit he
 He also has a wife and three sons as dependents
 bhukh ke asaadhaaran evam aprihaary sankat main funs kar bhi vah apane kisi bhi putr ko bajhaar main bech de vah uchit nahin he
 Therefore, if he beaks himself as the family of the family, then he will be considered right
 parantu “ sabhi ko apni hi aatma sab se adhik priy hoti he ”- is krur satya ko dhyaan main liya jaay or phir sochaa jaay to shaayad teen main se ek putr ko bech dene kii baat kadachit sahya ban sakegi
 In the same way, the age-old weakness of the parents is also of Kubul that the father is loved by the eldest son and the mother is loved by the junior
 to bechaara ‘ tapasvi ’ madhyamputra aisi visham paristhiti main nishchit hi bali kaa bakra ban jaataa he
 In this way, the aggrieved father, Azigart, by taking cows from King Harishchandra, and selling a son in exchange for him, might - yes, perhaps - be reluctantly judged judicial
 kintu vahi pita apane putr ko yagyeey pashu ke rup main, harishchandr kii yajyashala main baandhane ko taiyaar ho jaay or aise adham krity ke liye duusari so gaayen maang le to vah lobhivriti kaa parinaam hi kaha jaayegaa
 Narrator Mahidas Aitareya has also described the climax of greed
 yup ke saath putr shunagashep ko baandhane ke baad pita ajigart apane paapakarm se virat nahin hota he
 Yajna will not be complete unless one slaughter in the sacrifice as a sacrifice
 gaanv main se koi bhi chandal aakar ek manushya kaa vadh karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 So Shunshape's father Azigart Lobhavashat is ready for this sin
 usne teesri so gaayon ko maang kar le lee
 And ruthlessly rises with a drawn sword to kill his own son
 - yah chitra ek laalchee pita kii nirghrinata ko udghaatit karata he
 In philosophies which have been counted as Shad Ripu - Kama, Krodh, Mad, Moh, Greed and Matsar - successive Ripu among them is considered to be strong
 arthath pahele kamadi chaar ripuon se paanchava lobh naamak ripu adhik balvan he
 From this point of view, the second type of father has not only disturbed the patriarchy by being tempted
 parantu maanavmaryada kaa bhi atikaraman karke paapmarg par sudur tak nikal gaya he
 The third father is the sage Vishwamitra, who had one son each
 unke hotrutv main shunagashep kaa yajna main bali dena nishchit hua tha
 He has seen Shunha Shape as a sacrificial animal, tied in a pathetic condition before him
 unki dayaneey manoyatnaa evam nihsahaayta bhi pratipal dekhi he
 And in a critical situation, patiently following the path of worship of the gods, trying to get rid of the death loop by becoming their own savior, they have observed closely
 prajapati, agni, savita, varun, vishwedeva, asvins, indra or ushaa – sabhi vaidic devataaon ko shunagashep apane mantrabal se kramshah pratyaksh karata jaataa he
 Also talks to them
 aisa sachcha vidyavan brahmanputra kis rishi ko pasand nahin aayegaa ? Rishi Vishwamitra considered such Shunsha Shep to be his inheritance - knowledge
 And in his heart Mana Shunhashep accepted him as his son
 vishwamitra ek pita ke rup main gungnata vyakti the
 He called his first fifty sons and asked Shunha Shep to accept him as the first brother-in-law
 parantu un putron ne pitru-ajna nahin maani
 Therefore, Vishwamitra declared those fifty to be 'ineligible'
 ve rishi-sampatti ke daay bhaag se vanchit ho gayi
 After this, who was the twenty-first son named Madhuchanda and all his followers, he considered Shun Shashep as his eldest brother
 phir vishwamitra rishi ne shunagashep ko “ devraat ” namase uddhoshit kiya
 People with sonship should want to become virtuous fathers like Pehle Vishwamitra
 vishwamitra ne apane shatadhik putron kii apeksha se shreshth putr ke rup main is mantradrashtaa shunagashep ko hi pasand kiya he or usko apane putr ke rup main bhi sweekaar liya he – yah baat bady suchak he
 If such a son was found, then only what Narada had said that - "son, there is light in the Supreme Vyom," - that can be a matter, otherwise not
 is aakhyaan main raja harishchandr, daridr ajigart evam rishi vishwamitra jaise teen pitaaon kii tulana kerani aavashyak banati he, vaise hi teen prakaar ke putron kii bhi tulana karne yogya he
 As - Rohit, the son of King Harishchandra is the first
 vah apane pita ke prastaav kaa virodh karata he or pitru-ajna ko thukraa kar, praanon kii raksha karne ke liye grihatyag karke van main vicharan karne lagata he
 After this, the father has a disease called ascites - after hearing this, inspired by the patriarchy, he decides to return home
 parantu maarg main indradev mil gayi, uske kehane main aa jaataa he or vah baar baar dusron ke kehane main aakar van main waapas laut jaataa he
 The result of the sermon that Indra preached with these words is that during Harishchandra's son Rohit, one of his poor sons, Ajigart, wandering in search of food, found three sons together
 rohit ne raajputr hone ke kaaran, rajalakshmi ke jor par, arthath baap-kamai ke jor par, daridr vyakti ke ek deen-hin putr ko kharid kar apane saath main le kar rajmahal main waapas aata he
 Prince Rohit has kept in mind that by sacrificing this poor-brahmanaputra, he will free the father from Varuna's loop and he will also get rid of himself
 - yahan par indra ke kahene main aakar baar baar van-vicharan karte rahete rohit kaa, pahele ek anirnaayak manobalavaale putr ke rup main parichay miltaa he or baad main, swaarthee tathaa baap-kamai kaa ashrayan lenevaale raajputr ke rup main parichay miltaa he
 In the world, this is the first type of son
 
 The second type of son in the world is the 50 sons of sage Vishwamitra
 ve vishwamitra jaise mantradrashtaa pita kii bhi ajna maanate nahin he
 These sons, disregarding the wisdom of the father, lost their paternal heritage and were also cursed
 parinamtah ve samaaj main dasyuon jaisaa jivan jeene lagate he
 The son of twenty-one Madhuchanda and his 50 brothers-in-law obeyed the father
 vishwamitra kii drushti main vishwaas karanevaale in putron ne shunagashep ko apane jyeshtha bhrata ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 
 tisare prakaar kaa jo putr sadaiv spruhaniya hota he, vah he shunagashep
 After reading the entire narrative, it seems that he was an aphrodisiac, but was a son of continuous learning
 kyonki varun ke pash se mukt hone ke liye jo mantra rugveda ke chaturth mandal or pancham mandal main aaye huye he in sab ko vah acchhee tarah se jaanata tha
 Along with that, he himself is also the seer of many mantras stored in the First Circle
 at ev vah rishi vishwamitra kii drushti main spruhaniya putr ban jaataa he
 Vishwamitra had 101 and sons of his own
 kintu unako shunagashep jaisaa mantra-drashtaa putr na hone kaa afsos tha
 Therefore, he summons his auspices and orders Shunashape to accept him as the eldest brother
 unki drushti main shunagashep jaisaa putr hi sangrahya evam spruhaniya he
 Vishwamitra has seen during the entire yagya kriya that Shunha Shape is a devrat in the true sense
 agni, varun, indra, asvins, vishwedeva evam ushaa ityadi devataayen hi unki sampatti – raati – the or usee ke bal upar usne apni mukti haansil kii he
 Here, because of Shunahshep learning - Vyasangi knows so much mantra or can see new mantra - it is not enough to say that
 usne to apane pita kaa paap bhi unke munh par kah diya he
 That is, Shunahshep can also see the truth, and by standing in front of the father, he can also tell
 vahi uski mahanata he
 The person speaking such truth frees Varuna from the loop and not the other
 kyonki varun to neetimatta kaa evam rut kaa paalak dev kaha gaya he
 Therefore, he frees Satyaniti's seer Shaunshape from bondage
 aisa satyavaktaa putr hi pitaaon ke liye param vyom main jyoti swaroop ban saktaa he
 And only such a son should be wished for
 arthath putraishna bhi vivekadrushti se niyantrit honi chaiye
 In this way, after the recapitulation of the recitation, the epilogue of this narrative is also immediately understood - 1
 Why is there any information to recite this narrative in the consecration of any king? rajya kaa vaaris praapt karne ke liye andhshraddha-grast hona anuchit he
 2
 However, even those wishing for a son should recite this narrative - this is what is said in the epilogue to understand the three types of sons aforesaid
 
 It is also necessary to state incidentally here that in view of the epilogue of this narrative - "was the sacrifice offered in the Vedas or not?" "churches like this have been happening all over the world till today, but that discussion is going on in misguided direction - it is believed
 ab prastut abhinav drushti se dekha jaay to putraishna se peedit is sansar ko shunagashep kaa sandesh yahi he ki stribhrun-hatya se virat hone kaa avasar aa gaya he
 No daughter takes Matapita to hell and all the sons cannot become the true light carrying the Supreme Ether

 yah parampara tab se mahaan bani hui he jab purush hi mahilaon kaa abhinay karte the or ab mahilaayein purushon kaa abhinay karne lagi hai
 The dance is performed in a special traditional way

 internet par hindi ke prayokta aisa phone chaahate hai jisase ki ve apane phone par bhi hindi kaa prayog kar saken jisamen ki hindi citon kii surfing, email, gapshap, bloging, twitting aadi shaamil hai
 Now the question arises as to how Hindi is supported in mobile phones
 mobile main hindi samarthan ke mukhya rup se teen pahalu hai
 Whether Hindi text or text can be displayed on mobile? If Hindi cannot be seen in the phone, then there will be no input, this is the first condition of Hindi support
 kuch phonon main hindi pradarshan kaa purna samarthan hota he
 Some have partial Unicode support, but Hindi is not visible correctly i
e
 quantities and conjuncts do not appear correctly and Hindi appears scattered
 iskaa kaaran he ki phone main hindi font to hota he parantu phone kaa complex script leout ingine hindi kaa samarthan nahin karata arthath devanagari ko sahi tareeke se rendor nahin karata
 In such phones, Hindi can be seen correctly in some software which uses its own Hindi font engine instead of the phone
 jin phonon main hindi kaa bilkul samarthan nahin hota unamem hindi kii jagah dibbe prakat hote hai
 If the phone has support for Hindi display, there may or may not be an option for input
 yadi phone main hindi input kaa vikalp ho to hindi main esemes bheje ja sakate hai tathaa vaib par kahin bhi taxt box main hindi likhi ja sakati he
 With this option, all the work can be done on the internet including sending emails, writing letters, commenting in Hindi from mobile
 adhiktar phonon main hindi tankan ke liye tii-9 system hota he
 All Devanagari characters are accommodated on the nine buttons on the keypad and the correct characters are typed by pressing them repeatedly
 iske atirikt kai phonon menti-9 purvanumaan bhi hota he jisase ki purvaabhaasi input dwaara keval kuch batan dabaakar shabdon ko tip kiya ja saktaa he
 Prediction is very helpful in typing Hindi in phone easily, after a little practice, Hindi can be typed at a much faster speed than forecast
 jo shabd phone ke purvanumaan shabdkosh main na hon unhen joda ja saktaa he jisase agali baar ve purvanumaan dwaara tip kiye ja sakate hai
 Some phones with touch screen which have Hindi support are available with inscript onscreen virtual keyboard
 yah computer ke ikhmai kii tarah hota he jisase ki phone main kahin bhi hindi likhi ja sakati he
 Hindi interface means that the phone has the option of Hindi as the interface language
 phone main hindi interphes bhashaa chunane par sabhi minu, vikalp aadi hindi main pradarshit hote hai
 However, even when the Hindi interface is available, very few people use it, due to which there is incorrect translation and clear terminology 
 yadi phone main interphes bhashaa hindi kaa vikalp he to aam taur par hindi disple evam input samarthan hoga hi
 To find it in Nokia phone, go to Menu> Settings> Phone> Phone Language
 yadi he to aapke phone main pradarshan evam input kaa samarthan maujuud he, interphes bhashaa kaa ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi
 To find out, try sending a message in Hindi from that phone to another phone, or if GPRS is enabled in the phone, try opening a Hindi site
 isse pataa chal jayega ki phone main hindi padhi ja sakati he yaa nahin? All low level, mostly medium tier and some lower tier phones of Nokia have Hindi support
 adhiktam nimna tathaa madhyam stareey phone S40 sanchaalan pranali yukt hote hai jinamein aam taur par hindi samarthan hota he
 Nokia C3 is the first model of Nokia to feature physical Hindi inscript keypad
 adhiktar ucch stareey phone S60 prachaalan tantra yukt hote hai jinamein aam taur par hindi samarthan nahin hota
 Only a few select Nokia models of Nokia have full Hindi support
 abhi tak nokia ke kisi bhi tach screen phone main hindi samarthan nahin dekha gaya
 Nokia phones have T9 input system for Hindi
 devanagari varnon ko 9 kunjiyon par nimna anusaar sat kiya gaya he
 1 = ः1 2 = a aa i i u uu ri 2 3 = a Ai xxwrep 4 o 3 4 = k kha ga gha ng 4 qa kh ga 5 = f six hours 6 = t tha da dha na 6 d dh 7 = True Date 7 ध 8 = pa pha ba bha m 8 fa 9 = Yr xxwrep 10 y 9 uparokt varnon main phone modelon ke anusaar thodaa antar ho saktaa he par mukhya kram vahi rahata he
 To enable Hindi input in a text box, go to Options> Writing Languages> Hindi or press and hold the "*" key of the phone, then the option of Writing Languages comes up
 purvanumani paath input dwaara keval kuch batan dabaakar shabdon ko tip kiya ja saktaa he
 Prediction is very helpful in typing Hindi in phone easily, after a little practice, Hindi can be typed at a much faster speed than forecast
 jo shabd phone ke purvanumaan shabdkosh main na hon unhen joda ja saktaa he jisase agali baar ve purvanumaan dwaara tip kiye ja sakate hai
 To switch the forecast on / off, press and hold the top left corner key on the phone, use the "*" key to temporarily change it
 adhiktar ucch stareey phone S60 sanchaalan pranali yukt hote hai jinamein aam taur par hindi samarthan nahin hota
 Only a few select Nokia models of Nokia have full Hindi support
 nokia ke bina tachascreen vaale adhiktar phone S60 v3 sanskaran yukt hote hai jinamein aam taur par hindi pradarshan samarthan hota he parantu input samarthan nahin, udhaaharan ke liye nokia i63, nokia i71 aadi
 Most of Nokia's touchscreen phones are equipped with S60 v5 version which has partial support for Hindi display, ie Hindi appears in the phone due to the Hindi font, but not properly rendered, due to which the numbers and ligatures do not appear correctly
 , For example Nokia N97, Nokia N97 Mini, Nokia 5800 Express Music, Nokia 5233, Nokia 5230 etc
 Symbian^3 vaale smartphonon jaise bin8 aadi main bhi yahi sthiti he
 In these, Hindi appears correctly in the Opera mobile browser
 abhi tak nokia ke kisi bhi tach screen phone main purna hindi samarthan nahin dekha gaya
 Nokia's Symbian 60 Series phones have a tool called langswitcher for easy switching between languages, with the help of which languages can be switched through a hotkey
 jin simbian aadhaarit nokia mobile phonon main hindi samarthan nahin he, unamem hindi sakasham karne hetu kuch internet formon main hack bataaye gayi hai yadhyapi unamem se kisi ke bhi safaltaapurvak kaam karne kii nishchit jaankaree nahin he
 For this, try searching "install Hindi support in Nokia" etc
 on Google
 in vidhiyon dwaara phone main hindi font to joda ja saktaa he parantu taxt ke sahi rup se randar na hone kii samasya bani rahati he
 Apart from this, Hindi is seen in some phone models but due to broken and scattered, it may be due to lack of a rendering engine for Hindi Unicode
