a large number of Internet service providers have set their DNS servers to violate the rules, assuming they have been allowed to run a less expensive hardware than a full scheduled resolver
 jatilta ke antim str ke rup main, kuch aplicoshan ke bhi apane DNS cash hote he, taaki ve swayan DNS risolver pustkaalay / librari kaa prayog kam karen
 This adds further difficulty when debugging DNS issues, as it makes it difficult to detect the freshness of data and / or tell which cache the data is coming from
 ye cash aam taur par bahut kam kaishing samay - ek minute ke aadesh par - kaam karte hai
 Internet Explorer offers one notable exception: the version caches DNS records for half an hour according to recent

 Some other functions of the domain name system are: DNS mukhyatah port sankhya 53 par yuzar datagram protocol kaa prayog anurodh kaa uttar dene ke liye karata he
 In DNS queries, a UDP query by the client is answered by the server with a UDP result
 transmishan control protocol kaa prayog tab kiya jaataa he jab uttar ke rup main data kaa aakaar 512 bits se adhik he yaa phir zone sthaanantaran jaise kaaryon main kiya jaataa he
 Some operating systems such as HP-UX have implemented resolvers that use TCP in all types of queries even when only UDP is sufficient
 ek risource record domen naam pranali main moolbhoot data tatv he
 Each record has a type, an expiration limit, a class, and some special type of data
 ek hi prakaar ke risource record ek risource record set ko paribhaashit karte hai
 The order of a resource record in a set is undefined, sent by the resolver to the application, but often servers implement round robin commands to achieve load balancing
 baharhaal DNSSEC, ek vaidhanik kram main puure risource record par kaam karata he
 All records sent over an IP network use RFC 1035 and the common format shown below
 NAME / naam ek vriksh ke node kaa puri tarah se yogya domen naam he
 On the wire, the name can be truncated using label compression where the end of the current domain name can be replaced with the end of the existing domain name already mentioned in the packet
 type / tip record kaa prakaar he
 It describes the nature of the data and indicates its purpose
 udhaaharan ke liye, a record kaa prayog domen naam ko ek ipv4 pate par anuwaad karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, NS record yah suchi pradarshit karata he ki ek DNS zone main koun se naam sarwar lukup kaa jawaab de sakate hai or MX record us mail sarwar ko nirdisht karata he jo ek i-mail pate main nirdisht domen ke liye mail ko niyantrit karata he

 gyaat record tip RDATA kshetra main label sampeedan kaa prayog kar sakate hai, lekin "agyaat" prakaaron ko naaghin karnaa chahie 
 For common DNS records included in an Internet hostname, server, or IP address, the class of record is set to IN
 iske atirikt, CH or HS varg bhi maujuud hai
 Each class is a completely independent tree with potentially different delegations to the DNS zone

 The domain name system supports wildcard domain names that are names that begin with an asterisk label, '*', eg, * 
example
 wildcard domen naam se sambandhit DNS record ek DNS zone main risource naam utpann karne ke liye, sabhi labalon main se puche gayi naam se milte julate naam gata kar, jisamen nirdisht vanshavali bhi shaamil he, niyam nirdhaarit karata he
 For example, in the DNS zone x
example, the following setup states that all subdomains of x
example use the mail exchanger axexample
 mail excanger ko nirdisht karne ke liye a
x
example ke liye record kii jarurat he
 Since this result is obtained by matching the wildcard with the domain name and subdomain, all subdomains of axexample must be defined in wildcard results

 The original DNS protocol had limited provisions for expansion of new features
 1999 main paul viksi ne RFC 2671 main ek vistaar pranali saarvajanik kii jise DNS ke liye vistaar tantra kaha jaataa he jisamen bina kharch badaye prayukt na hone vaale vaikalpik protocol tatv the
 This was done through the opted resource record opt that was present only in the wire transmission of the protocol, but not in any zone files
 praarambhik vistaaron kaa bhi suzav diya gaya, jaise UDP datagram main DNS sandesh ke aakaar main vruddhi
 Dynamic DNS update updates the records kept in the zone data base on an official DNS server by adding or removing them with the help of DNS opcode
 yah suvidha RFC 2136 main varnit he
 This feature allows network subscribers to register in DNS when they boot or are available on the network
 chunki booting karne vaale graahak ko har baar DHCP sarwar dwaara ek alag IP pat saunpa ja saktaa he, is tarah ke graahakon ke liye sthir DNS uplabdh karana sambhav nahin he
 Although there are technically no restrictions on characters used in domain names and may include non-ascii characters, this does not apply to host names
 host naamon ko zyaadaatar log i-mail or web browzing ke liye dekhte or prayog karte hai
 Host names are limited to a small subset of ASCII characters known as LDH, lower and uppercase letters up to l AZ, d numbers up to 0-9, h hyphen, and dot to separate LDH labels; See RFC 3696 section 2 for detailed information
 This prevented the display of names and words of many local languages

 This can have far-reaching potential effects on millions of Internet users, if busy DNS servers cache bad IP data
 ise khatm karne ke liye sabhi prabhavit DNS cash ko manual dhang se saafe karnaa padegaa jo lambe TTL tak ho saktaa he
 Some domain names can be spoofed by other, similar domain names

 The right to use a domain name is granted by domain name registrars who are recognized by the Internet Corporation for Names and Numbers, an organization committed to overseeing the Internet's name and number system
 ICANN ke atirikt, prayek sheersh str domen, jo registry ko oparate karata he, kii dekharekh or takneekee sarvice ek prashasnic sanghathan dwaara kii jaati he

 One can obtain information about the holder of a domain name by looking in the WHOIS database maintained by several domain registries
 240 se adhik deshon ke code sheersh str domen ke liye, domen registriyaan aadhikarik WHOIS jaankaree rakhti hai
 
 For example, DENIC, Germany NIC official WHOIS

 Since 2001 most gtld registries have adopted this so-called "thick" registry approach, ie placing the official WHOIS in central registries instead of the registrars
 COM or NET domen naamon ke liye, ek "patali" registry prayukt hoti he: domen registry ek buniyadi WHOIS rakhti he

 For major common top-level domain registries such as COM, NET, ORG, INFO domains and others, a registry-registrar domain uses a model that includes hundreds of domain name registrars
 In this method of management, the registry only establishes a relationship with the domain name database and the registrar

 Critics often claim abuse of administrative power over domain names

com or 
NET domen ko verisign webpej par bhej detii thi
 For example, in a public meeting with verisign arguing over technical concerns about sitefinder, many people active in the IETF and other technical institutions explained how they, by verisign, changed a key component of the Internet's infrastructure Were surprised, which did not achieve consensus for it
 pehle pahal sitefinder ko, website se har internet poochtacha ke liye prayukt kiya gaya or isane dhan kamaane ke liye prashnon ke liye galat domen naam kaa prayog upyogkarta ko verisign khoj site par le ja kar kiya
 Unfortunately, other applications, such as many uses of email, for reasons of lack of response to the question, gave an indication that the domain does not exist and that the message could be interpreted as an unreachable message
 mul verisign karyanvayan ne mail ke liye is dharna ko tod diya, kyonki vah hameshaa galat domen naam ko sitefinder par bhej dete the
 While verisign later changed sitefinder's behavior with email, this act by verisign sparked fierce protests about how verisign did so in the interests of its Internet infrastructure component, which verisign was responsible for protecting
 More attention paid to financial interests

 Related Census Code: State Code: 09 District Code: 135 Tehsil Code: 00721 uttar pradesh ke jile Pandit Banarsidas Chaturvedi was a famous Hindi writer and journalist
 ve rajyasabha ke saansad bhi rahe
 In his editorship, a Hindi monthly called 'vishal Bharat' came out from Kolkata in Hindi
 pan banarsidas chaturvedi jaise sudhi chintak ne hi saakshaatkaar kii vidha ko pushpit evam pallavit karne ke liye sarvapratham sarthak kadam badhaayaa tha
 He was awarded the Padma Bhushan for his literary services
 ve apane samay kaa agraganya sampadak the tathaa apni vishisht or swatantra vritti ke liye jane jate hai
 There was no one in the entire Hindi literature as a reward for the memory of martyrs like him and for opposing cinematography
 unki smriti main banarsidas chaturvedi sammaan diya jaataa he
 It is said that he used to ask himself the same questions before joining any new social, cultural, literary or national campaign, joining hands in a new work or trending in a new work that he was asked about the country, society, its languages and literature, especially Will Hindi be good or will there be a reputation for higher values in any area of human life? san 1892 i main 24 disambar ko uttar pradesh ke firozabad main janme chaturvedi ji 1913 main inter kii pariksha paas karne ke baad paas hi sthit farrukhabad ke government hiskool main tees rupee masik vetan par adhyaaapak niyukt ho gaye
 But just a few months later, his mentor, Pandit Lakshmidhar Vajpayee, ordered him to leave his teaching and move to Agra and take over 'aryamitra'
 lakshmidhar ji un dinon agra se aryamitra nikaalte the
 In fact, Vajpayee was about to become the editor of his monthly 'navajivan' at the invitation of Dwarikaprasad Sevak and wanted to hand over 'aryamitra' to an editor who could live up to his confidence
 chaturvedi ji lakshmidhar vaajapeyi kii ajna shirodharya bhi kar lee thi, lekin isi bich unhen indaur ke us daily college main niyukti kaa aadesh mil gaya
 Chaturvedi ji was first in Indore Accompanied by Sampurnanand, who was a teacher in the same college, then Hindi Sahitya Sammelan was organized there, then the connection and contact of Mahatma Gandhi who came to preside over it gave new dimensions to his constantly restless service and creativity
 mahatma gandhi ne 1921 main gujarat viapeeth kii sthapana kii to unke aadesh par chaturvedi ji apni sevaayen arpit karne vahaan chale gaye
 Earlier, Gandhiji had collected the views of many mystics from across the country in the context of his campaign to make Chaturvedi as a national language, which was published as a booklet
 chaturvedi ji ne farrukhabad main apane adhyaapan kaal main hi totaaraam sanadhy ke liye unke sansmaranon kii pustak 'phiji dweep main mere 21 varsh' likh daali thi or tabhi 'aryamitra', 'bharat sudasha pravartak', 'navajivan' or 'maryaada' aadi us samay ke kai mahatvapurn patr-patrikaon main unke lekh aadi chhapane lage the
 The memoirs of 'my 21 Years in Fiji Island' were a very condescending depiction of the tragedy of migrant indentured laborers of India working under extremely harsh conditions on that island
 baad main chaturvedi ji ne sief andrus kii madhyam se in mazdooron kii durdasha kaa ant sunishchit karne ke liye bahuvidh praytn kiye
 According to Kaka Kalelkar, Chaturvedi's request to honor foreign mystics and human servants like Andrews in those days of nationalism was highly appreciated
 andrus ke nimantran par ve kuch dinon tak rabindranath thakur ke shanti niketan main bhi rahe the
 He used to call Andrews 'deenbandhu' and has written a book in English on his personality and work in collaboration with another author, whose role is written by Mahatma Gandhi
 lekin shikshan kaa kaam unhen is arth main katai raas nahin aa rahaa tha ki usamen tehraav bahut tha jabaki unki rachanaatmak pravriti ko har kadam par ek nai manzil kii talash rahati thi
 Finally one day he decided to take a leave from Gujarat Vidyapith and become a full-time journalist
 kolkata se prakashit masik ‘vishaal bharat’ ne unke sampadan main apana swarnakaal dekha
 At that time, only Birla will be a Hindi writer who has not aspired to see his works published in Vishal Bharat
 chaturvedi ji ke priy angrezi patr ‘modern rivyuu’ ke maalik or pratishthit patrkaar ramanand chattopadhyaay hi ‘vishaal bharat’ ke bhi maalik the
 He was convinced of Chaturvedi's editing skills and scholarship and Chaturvedi also respected him very much, but on the occasions of editorial disagreement, what should be considered by Chaturvedi
 aise kai avasar charchit bhi hue
 Chaturvedi Ji considered Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi as the biggest inspiration in his journalistic life after Mahatma Gandhi, whose biography he has also written
 1930 main unhone orchha naresh veerasingh ju dev ke prastaav par tikamgarh jaakar ‘madhukar’ naam ke patr kaa sampadan kiya
 Naresh assured him of his uninterrupted and uninterrupted editorial rights but later found that Chaturvedi ji did not allow even 'courtiers' in the tune of making 'madhukar' the bearer of national consciousness and the pioneer of cultural revolution
 So he stopped publishing
 bharat ke swatantra hone ke pashchaat chaturvedi ji baarah varsh tak rajyasabha ke manonith sadsy rahe or 1973 main unhen padmabhushan se sammanit kiya gaya
 Before departing from this world on May 2, 1985, he wrote in his account 'literature and life', 'sketches', 'memoirs', 'satyanarayana Kaviratna', 'bharatbhakta Andrews', 'keshav Chandra Sen', 'pravasi Bharatiya Diwas', Compositions like 'indians in Fiji', 'problems of Fiji', 'our Adorable' and 'setubandha'
 unhone kai videshyatraaen kin or desh-videsh main anek saamaajik, saanskrithik va saahitiyik sansthaaon or pratibhaaon ke pushpan-pallavan main bhi vishisht yoga diya
 Popular author of the Indian Revolutionary Movement, Sudhir Vidyarthi, says that he got involved in the mission of protecting the revolutionaries only after being inspired by the 'freedom Struggle Warrant' of Agra's 'yuvak' monthly edited by Chaturvedi in 1972
 ve chaturvedi ji ko apana ‘guruvar’ bataate hai or khud ko unka ‘priy vidhyaarthee’

 It narrates the story of the slaughter of Shishupala by Krishna
 jaraasandh kaa vadh karke shri krishna, arjuna or bhim indraprastha laut aaye evam dharmraj yudhisthir se sara vrittant kaha jise sunakar ve atyant prasann huye
 After that, Dharmaraja Yudhishthira started preparing for the Rajasuya Yajna
 us yajna ke ruthij acharya hota the
 To make the yagna successful, there are all the great sages of Bharatvarsha - Lord Ved Vyas, Bharadwaj, Sunuttu, Gautama, Asit, Vasistha, Chyavan, Kandava, Maitreya, Kavash, Jit, Vishwamitra, Vamdev, Sumati, Jamin, Kratu , Pal, Parashar, Garg, Vaishampayan, Atharva, Kashyapa, Dhaumya, Parashurama, Shukracharya, Asuri, Veethotra, Madhudanda, Veerasen, Akitrabran etc
 - were present
 sabhi deshon ke rajaadhiraj bhi vahaan padhaare
 The Ritijas started the yajna-bhoomi with the plow of gold by scripture method and initiated Dharmaraja Yudhishthira
 dharmraj yudhisthir ne somalata kaa ras nikaalane ke samay yajna kii bhul-chook dekhne vaale sadpatiyon kii vidhivat puja kii
 Now all the councilors started thinking about which deity to be worshiped first of all
 tab sahadev ji uth kar bole - Hearing the words of Paramdev Sahdev ji, all the saints have made sages! Hermit Calling it bhishma pitamah ne swayan anumodan karte huye sahadev ke kathan kii prashansa kii
 Then Dharmaraja Yudhishthira started worshiping Lord Shri Krishna by scripture method
 chediraj shishupal apane asana par baitha hua yah sab drishy dekh rahaa tha
 He could not bear the foremost worship of Shri Krishna proposed by Sahadeva and supported by Bhishma and his heart was filled with anger
 vah uth kar khadaa ho gaya or bolaa, "he sabhaasadon! mujhe aisa prathit ho rahaa he ki kaalvash sabhi kii mati maari gai he
 Is not this child more intelligent than Sahadev in this meeting, who has accepted the worship of an unqualified person by joining this child yes? Is no one greater in age, strength and intelligence than this Krishna? The great trikaldarshi sage-maharishi is here
 bade-bade raja-maharaja yahan par upasthit hai
 Is there no one else here like this cow grazing? Can a crow take a car? Can Gidad get lion's share? It has no clan nor caste, nor does it have any varna

 bhala yah kis prakaar agrpuja paane kaa adhikari he? is prakaar shishupal jagat ke swami shri krishna ko gaali dene laga
 Condemning his bitter words, Arjuna and Bhimsen along with many kings were determined to kill him, but Shri Krishna Chandra stopped them all
 shri krishna ke anek bhakt sabha chhod kar chale gayi kyonki ve shri krishna kii ninda nahin sun sakate the
 When Shishupala had given a hundred abuses to Shri Krishna, then Shri Krishna thundered and said, "just Shishupala! Now a single abusive word comes out of your face about me, then your life will not be saved
" maine tere ek sau apshabdon ko kshamaa karne kii pratigya kii thi isi liye ab tak tere praan bache rahe
 "hearing these words of Shri Krishna, all the supporters of Shishupala present in the house were shaken with fear but the destruction of Shishupala was near
 atah usne kaal ke vash hokar apni talwaar nikaalte huye shri krishna ko phir se gaali di
 As soon as the abusive word came out of Shishupala's mouth, Shri Krishna started his Sudarshan Chakra and in the blink of an eye, Shishupala's head fell off
 uske sharir se ek jyoti nikal kar bhagwaan shri krishnachandra ke bheetar samaa gai or vah paapi shishupal, jo teen janmon se bhagwaan se bair bhav rakhte aa rahaa tha, paramgati ko praapt ho gaya
 It was the same gatekeeper of Lord Vishnu who was cursed by the Sunkadi monks

 sextent sabase saral or sugathit yantra he jo prekshak kii kisi bhi sthiti par kinhin do binduon dwaara bana kone paryaapt yatharthata se naapane main kaam aata he
 It was invented independently by scientists such as John Hadley and Tomas Godfrey in 1730
 tab se itani avadhi guzarane par bhi yah yantra prachlit hi nahin he varan bade chaav se prayog main aata he
 The main reason for this is that more convenient features are available than other angiometer
 pehali visheshta yah he ki anya konemapi yantron kii bhanti ise prekshan ke samay ekadam sthir rakhana yaa kisi nishchit avasthaa main rakhana anivaary nahin he
 The second feature is that the position of the observer and the point on it are in horizontal, vertical or oblique plane, this device can measure the amount of actual angle made in that plane
 in visheshtaon ke kaaran sextent navik kii uski yatra kii disha kaa gyaan karaane ke liye aaj bhi bada upyog yantra he
 Two types of sextants are used
 ek, baks sextent or doosraa khagoleey yaa navik sextent
 There is no theoretical difference in the texture of the two
 inaki banaavat kaa siddhant yah he ki yadi kisi samtal main prakaash kii koi kiran aamane-saamne munh kiye khadey samtal darpanon se ek ke baad duusare par paravartit hone ke baad dekhi jaae to dekhi gai kiran or mul kiran ke bich bana kone paravartak darpanon ke bich parsparik kone se duuna hoga
 An angle of 120 ° to the sextant can be measured at once
 isse bada kone hone par do yaa adhik se adhik teen bhaag karke naapnaa hoga
 The box sextant is a small, about 8 cm diameter by four cm height
 upar kaa dhakkan khol dene par upar kuch pench or ek burneer thami hui bhujaa dikhaai degi jo anshon par uske chote bhaagon main vibhajit chaap par chal sakati he
 Like a squad, a screw is attached to the arm
 dibiya ke bheetar dhansi pench kii pindi se ek samtal darpan laga rahata he
 This is called a directive mirror
 pench ghumaane se darpan or saath hi ankit chaap par bhujaa main laga burneer chalata he
 This allows the angular momentum of the mirror to be known
 is nirdash darpan ke saamne hi ek doosraa darpan rahata he jiskaa neeche kaa aadha bhaag paardarshee or upar kaa paravartak hota he
 One of the two points between which the angle has to be measured is seen from the transparent part of the horizon mirror with a telescope or hole made in the box and the reflection of the other point is visible in the horizon mirror after one reflection from the reference mirror
 is samay pench se nirdesh darpan aise ghumaate hai ki kshitij darpan ke paardarshee bhaag se dekhe bindu kii kiran pratibimb kii kiran par sannipati ho jaae
 At this time, the angle between the two mirrors will be half of the angle formed by both points at the position of the observer
 darpanon ke bich kaa kone burneer suchak ke saamne ankit chaap par padhaa ja saktaa he jisase binduon ke bich kaa kone gyaat ho sake
 a magnifying lens is placed on the Bernier indicator itself to take correct readings
 magar chaap par anshankan is prakaar kiya jaataa he ki binduon dwaara nirmit kone sidhaa padhaa ja sake
 To provide this facility, double the amount of speed of the mirror is written
 jaise 10° ke saamne 20°, 20° ke saamne 40°, isi prakaar antim anshankan 60° ke saamne 120° likhte hai
 The amount read from this will be the amount of the angle
 kone ek minute tak sahi pard sakate hai
 It is a 60 ° segment of metal whose arc is inscribed
 vakr ke centre se ek bhujaa chaap par faili hoti he
 Bernier and a tactile screw are attached to the tip of this arm
 isi bhujaa par upar nirdesh darpan laga rahata he
 The arm can rotate at the center, along with the instruction mirror and the Bernier on the arch
 chaap ko thame ek ardhavyas par nirdesh darpan ke saamne aadha paardarshee or aadha paravartak kshitij kaanch dridhtaa se laga hota he jisase hokar dekhne ke liye saamne doorabeen hoti he
 It is clear that its structure is similar to the box sextant and also the mode of observation
 surya ke prekshan ke liye rangeen kaanch rahata he
 The fraction and its small division are made up to 20 ¢ or 10 ¢ according to the size of the device at an arc of 60 °
 burneer se 202 yaa 102 tak padhane kii suvidha rahati he
 In order to obtain the correct reading from the sextant, the following geometric relationships must be made and, if not, these relationships are established by adjusting: suchakank or kshitij kaanch chaap ke samtal par lamb hon, When the Bernier index is zero, the director and the horizon mirror are parallel, and drushtirekha chaap ke samtal ke samaantar ho

 prayek rajya chaahe vah udaaravaadi ho yaa samaajawaadee yaa samyavaadee, yahaan tak ki sena ke general dwaara shasit pakistan kaa adhinayakawadi bhi apane ko loktantric kahata he
 To be honest, in today's era, claiming to be democratic has become a fashion
 loktantr kii purnatah sahi or sarvamaanya paribhaasha dena kathin he
 Cranston has rightly said that there are different perceptions regarding democracy
 linset kii paribhaasha adhik vyapak prathit hoti hai uske anusaar, “loktantr ek aisi raajnneetik pranali he jo padaadhikariyon ko badal dene ke niyamit sanvidhanik avasar pradaan karti he or ek aise rachanaatantr kaa praavdhaan karti he jiske tahat jansankhya kaa ek vishaal hissaa raajnneetik prabhaar praapt karne ke icchhuk pratiyogiyon main se manonukool chayan kar mahatvapurn nirnyon ko prabhavit karti he
 Defining democracy, mcpherson considered it 'the only constructive system in which governments are elected and authorized or laws are made and decided in some other form
 ‘ shoopter ke anusaar, ‘loktantric vidhi raajnneetik nirnay lene hetu aisi sansthagat vyavastha he jo janata kii saamaanya ichha ko kriyanvit karne hetu tatpar logon ko chaynit kar saamaanya hit ko saadhane kaa kaary karti he
 In fact, democracy is basically a system associated with participatory politics for civil and political freedom
 loktantr kii avadharana ke sambandh main pramukh siddhanth nimnlikhit hai: Concepts such as freedom, equality, rights, secularism and justice occupy a prominent place in the liberal tradition of democracy, and liberal thinkers have been advocating democracy as the best system to embody these concepts from the beginning
 nripatiyon or saamanti prabhuon se mukti ke baad samaaj ke shashan-sanchaalan kii drushti se loktantr ko swaabhaavik raajnneetik pranali ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya
 macpherson says that concepts like selection politics, competitive polity and market polity had developed even before the advent of democracy in the Western world
 hakeekat main is arth main udaar rajya kaa hi loktantrikaran ho gaya, na ki loktantr kaa udaarikaran
 The early signs of democratic sentiment can be found in the literature of British thinkers such as Tomsmoor and Winstanley and in the literature of British Extremism, but the true beginning of democratic sentiment began with the birth of the principle of social contract, because the inherent sense of social contract of citizens is the same for all individuals
 Equality

 adam smith ne mukt bazaar kaa pratimaan is loktantric aadhaar par hi prastut kiya ki prayek vyakti ko utpaadan karne, kharidne or bechney kii swatantraaa he
 The famous utilitarian philosophers Mill and Bentham fully supported democracy and provided it with an effective intellectual foundation through utilitarianism
 unke anusaar, loktantr upyogetavaad arthath adhiktam logon ke adhiktam sukh ko adhiktam sangrakshan pradaan karata he, kyonki log apane shaskaon se tathaa ek duusare se sangrakshan kii apeksha rakhte hai or is sangrakshan ko sunishchit karne ke sarvottam tareeke hai, pratinidhimulak loktantr, sanvaidhanik sarkaar, niyamit chunaav, gupt matdaan, pratiyogi daleey raajnneeti or bahumat ke dwaara shashan

 Mill added another point to Bentham's argument in favor of democracy, stating that democracy contributes more to the moral development of mankind than any other system of governance
 uski drushti main loktantr naitik atmotthana or vaiyaktik kshamtaaon ke vikaas evam vistaar kaa sarvocch madhyam he
 In this connection, it is noted that neither Bentham and Mill had any universal adult suffrage or one person favored one vote
 1802 tak bentham ne simit matadhikaar kii vakaalat kii or 1809 main sirf sampann virgon ke grihaswamiyon ke liye simit matadhikaar kaa naaraa diya or antatogatva 1817 main saarvbhaum matadhikaar kaa aahvaan kiya, lekin is adhikaar ko mardon tak hi simit rakhaa
 Similarly, Mill was also not in favor of universal adult suffrage, as he feared that the people of one class could maintain their dominance by being a majority and could only legislate their own interests against the interests of other classes

 The archaic liberal view of democracy has been challenged by many thinkers from time to time
 prathamtah, loktantr kii is manyata par prashn khadey kiye gaye hai ki prayek vyakti yah jaanata he ki uske liye sarvottam kya he
 Thinkers such as Lord Bryce, Graham Walls etc
 believe that man is not as judicious, neutral, knowledgeable or active as he is supposed to be for the operation of democracy
 dwitiyatah, loktantr janata ke shashan kii aadharshila par tikaa hota he, kintu yah spashtatah batalaana aasaan nahin he ki ‘shashan‘ or ‘janata‘ ke bilkul sahi arth kya he
 Hence Lokmat as the basis of government is a myth

 Fifthly, in democracy the party system often becomes a game of elite or controlled by those who are resourceful and they decide on important issues

 Liberals have unduly considered it to be simple, transparent and just
 or sabase badi truti is siddhanth main yah he ki yah raajnneetik samanta kintu aarthik vishmata par aadhaarit he
 In the twentieth century, political thinkers began to raise the question whether the masses can play a role in politics in everyday life? Can ordinary citizens, who are engaged in earning their livelihood, invest time and power to play a political role? Will freedom be destroyed if the people openly display their feelings through electoral democracy without any restrictions? In answer to these questions, aristocratic and pluralistic principles of democracy have developed
 abhijan pad kaa prayog kisi samooh ke aise alpsankhyak varg ke liye hota he jo kuch karkon kii vajah se samudaay main vishisht haisiyat rakhte hai
 It takes place in a leading role in the distribution of power in a minority class society
 raajnneetik shreshthivarg, presnts ke anusaar, saamudayik maamalon main apane sankhya-bal ke anupaat main kahin zyada satta kaa upbhog karata he
 The emergence of the aristocracy in the context of democracy occurred after World War II, among the promoters of this theory are Wilfredo Pareto, Gratanomowska, Robert Michels, and American authors James Barnham and C
 Wright Mills
 is siddhanth kaa mukhya aadhaar yah manyata he ki samaaj main do tarah ke log hote hai- gine chune vishisht leg or vishaal jansamooh
 Distinguished people always reach the summit because they are the best people with all the qualifications
 abhijan varg vishesh rup se raajnneetik abhijan varg, saare raajnneetik krityon kaa nishpaadan karata he, satta par ekadhikaar kar letaa he or satta se jude saare laabh uthaata he
 The majority group is arbitrarily controlled and guided by the elite
 sangathit alpsankhyak hi hameshaa asangathit jansamooh ko shasit or nirdeshit karata he
 Robert Michels has used the phrase 'iron law of oligarchy' to say that the general classes must accept the subjugation of the elite class because a large section of the population is indifferent and incompetent in self-rule
 loktantr ke abhijan siddhanth kii mukhya visheshtaye hai : The well-known rendering of the elitist theory of democracy was first done by Joseph Schumpeter in his book 'capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'
 baad main sartori, robert daal, ikstine, remand aron, karl main hiyumond, sidney varba aadi ne apni rachanaaon main is mat kaa samarthan kiya
 This concept of democracy is based on the belief that the vast majority of the population is inefficient and neutral and that they elect some people based on merit and ability who control and govern the political party
 bahusankhyak log jeevika kamaane main vyast rahete hai
 They have neither interest nor understanding in political matters
 isliye ve abhijanvarg se kuch logon kaa chayan kar lete hai or unke anuyaayi ban jate hai
 According to the elitist theory, expertise is essential for efficiency in today's complex society and the number of experts is always small
 atah rajnatik netritv aise chuninda sakasham logon ke haath main hona aavashyak he
 This theory also considers the extreme participation of people as dangerous, because a powerful leader like dictator, Hitler, can mobilize the masses to destroy power and end democracy, which means the end of fundamental freedoms
 isliye unka daawa he ki loktantric or udaaravaadi mulyon ko bachaae rakhane ke liye jansamooh ko raajnneeti se alag rakhana jaruri he
 According to the eligibility principle, there cannot be actual rule by the general public
 shashan hameshaa janata ke liye hota he, janata ke dwaara kabhi nahi, kyonki janata jinhen pratinidhi chunati he ve abhijanvarg ke hi hote hai
 In other words, democracy means the rivalry among the elite classes and the decision by the public as to which elite will rule above
 is prakaar, loktantr maatr ek aisi karypranali he jiske dwaara chote samoohon main se ek janata ke newnatakam atirikt samarthan se shashan karata hai abhijanvaadee siddhanth yah bhi maanata he ki abhijan virgon- raajnneetik dalon, netaaon, bade vyapaaree gharaanon ke karypalkon, svaichhik sanghathanon ke netaaon or yahaan tak ki shramik sanghathanon ke bich mataiky aavashyak he taaki loktantr kii aadharbhoot karypranali ko gaiyr jimmdar netaaon se bachaaya ja sake
 This makes it clear that the elitist class theory externally claims to make the idea of democracy more pragmatic and empirical, but ultimately it transforms democracy into a conservative political theory that is satisfied with liberal or neo-liberal status quoism Gets and wants to maintain its durability
 abhijanwaad kii kai vichaarkon ne aalochana kii he jinamein si

 The following are the main objections against this principle: loktantr kaa bahulwaadi siddhanth bhi jan saamaanya ke badale samoohon kii bhoomika par bal detaa he
 Some thinkers have represented such principles related to democracy which are a mixture of aristocratic principles and pluralistic principles
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki bahulwaadi siddhanth kii utpatti abhijan siddhanth kii aanshik pratikriya ke rup main hui he
 The elitist theory is satisfied with the creation of a situation in which power lies in the elites who make important decisions, but the pluralist insists on a system that will nullify the tendency of elitism in liberal democracies and reveal the right publicity 
 bahulwaad kii avadharana vaise to puraani he, kintu beesvin sadi main aadhunik udaaravaadi chintan kaa yah ek mahatvapurn ang ban gaya
 In general, pluralism propagates and decentralizes power in lieu of limiting it to a small group in society
 aadhunik audyogic or praudyogic kaal main, bahulawaadiyon ke anusaar, satta vikhandit ho gai he or isamen pratiyogi saarvajanik or nijee samoohon kii saajhedaari bad gai he
 People in high places no longer hold power like in the past, mainly because they began to play the role of mediator between conflicting interests
 vibhinn samooh apane netritv ke madhyam se madhyasthata karte hai or iske jariye vyakti kaa bhi pratinidhitiv ho jaataa he
 Although power has become concentrated among a few individuals due to industrial and technological integration and technological considerations, competition among minority but larger, interest groups goes in favor of public interest
 bade vyapaaree gharaanon, shram or sarkaar ke bich pratiyogita ne prayek samooh ko apni satta kaa durupyog karne par lagaam kasi he
 Thus, inequality in property, education and power among citizens is less affected as organizations and groups provide more representation than expected and this makes democracy more real and in this sense more viable
 bharat kaa hi udhaaharan len
 Here, the farmer organization of Mahendra Singh Tikait and the Narmada Bachao Andolan are such people's movements that become the voice of millions of poor and uneducated people
 or loktantr ko nishchay hi adhik vaastavik banaate hai
 It is true that the elites and their news media criticize them and call them a hindrance to progress and sometimes even the Supreme Court forces them to stop their movements, but in spite of all this, such mass movements make Indian democracy more meaningful

 Different selfish groups present their demands directly, but also through various political parties
 bahulwaadi loktantr kii ek paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he
 It is a political system in which policies are determined by mutual consultation and exchange of ideas between different groups because no group or elite is so strong that it can put enough pressure on the government alone to meet all its demands
 Could complete
 bahulwaadi satta kii is saajhedaari kaa anumodan karte hai ki isse laabh yah hota he ki koi bhi saamaajik samooh sarkaar kii niti- nirdhaaran kii prakriya par is kadar haaavee nahin ho paata ki vah anya virgon ke hiton kii andekhi kar sake
 But, there was also a belief of pluralist theorists that all citizens have the legal opportunity and economic resources to organize and pursue their interests in the political arena
 is avasar ke bagaiyr nagarik kisi prastaavit kadam kaa samarthan yaa virodh nahin kar sakate
 Pluralist thinkers consider politics to be a process of determination between groups rather than individuals, and declare that democracy works best only when citizens join groups supporting their special interests
 ve is baat par vishesh bal dete hai ki kisi samaaj main vyaktiyon kii sakriy sahabhaagita honi chahie or apane sankalp ko kriyanvit karne ke liye vibhinn samoohon se jud janaa chahie
 At the same time, all groups and their members must accept that elections are an effective weapon of participation of the larger community in political decisions
 isi tarah, abhijan varg ke saare samooh or sadsy parsparik pratiyogita ke dwaara loktantr ko sambhav banaate hai
 It is clear from this that the pluralistic theory does not really completely oppose elitism because according to its promoters, the existence of elite class is a reality and they are satisfied with its location
 yahi kaaran he ki bahulwaadi siddhanton kabhi-kabhaar abhijanvarg siddhanton se aanshik rup main hi bhinn samajha jaataa he
 The great American political thinker Robert Dal combines his elitist and pluralist notions of democracy and calls his democratic conception as a great system
 uske anusaar, janata samoohon or abhijanvarg ke raajnneetigyon donon ke madhyam se sakriy hoti he
 It has cited many communities that influence the policy making of the government - eg, business houses and industrialists, merchants, labor organizations, farmer organizations, consumers, voters, etc

 Not all groups are equally strong, and many groups are more effective at preventing adversaries than persuading them to have their own preferences
 bahulwaadi sinddhanth ke viruddh uthaai jane vaali aapattiyon main nimnlikhit pramukh hai: Participation in political activity is the core of democracy, but in capitalist democracies, it is often limited to voting in elections
 loktantr kaa sahabhaagita siddhanth sanwarddhit bhagidaari ko ek adarsh bhi maanata he or krutyaatmak aavashyaktaa bhi
 Prominent proponents of this theory include Carole Perlman, CB since the 1960s
 mcpherson and N
 Left-wing thinkers like Paul Jas have been prominent
 sahabhaagi loktantr kii do pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai: According to the principles of participatory democracy, if the task of making policy decisions is confined only to the elite, then the real nature of its democracy is disrupted
 isliye ve isamen aam aadmi kii sahabhaagita kii vakaalat karte hai
 They believe that if the democratic rights are confined to the pages of the paper or the articles of the constitution, then those rights have no meaning, hence the actual consumption of those rights by ordinary people is necessary
 lekin yah upbhog bhi tabhi sambhav he jabaki vyakti swatantra or samaan ho
 If people believe that opportunities for effective participation in policy decisions are not really present, then they will definitely become participants
 aisi sthiti main ve prabhavi dhang se saajhedaari bhi kar sakenge
 The democracy in which it is dominated by political or technical or democratic elite, is not satisfactory to the citizens and the people can end the class domination only through participation
 sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthakon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki aaj ke audyogic or praudyogic samaajon main shiksha kaa str unchaa ho gaya he or bauddhik tathaa rajnatik chetana se sampann samaaj main abhijan or gaiyr-abhijan ke bich kii khai kam hui he
 Therefore, participation of ordinary people is not a hindrance in most of the cases in terms of efficiency and development
 sach poocha jaae to satta kaa vikirnan hi atyaachaar ke viruddh sabase majboot suraksha-kavach he
 Only a democracy based on participation can protect citizens from neutrality, ignorance and isolation and can fulfill the basic needs of democracy
 prashn he, aam naagarik kii raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaise ho ? iske siddhantakaaron ne iske nimnlikhit tareeke bataae hai: mcpherson remarks that today's nations are vast in terms of region and population, and it is not possible that all citizens are involved in the political discourse or policy-making of the Rosemary, yet if certain conditions are accepted then the participation ratio is certain Can be increased ye sharte hai: David Held objected to the participatory principle, saying that it is better than the archaic / elite pluralist theories, but it is unclear how and why only the higher levels of participatory human development, which is an important goal of democracy, Will be able to achieve is baat kaa koi sakshya athwa tark sangat aadhaar nahin miltaa ki sahabhaagita nagarikon ko saamaanya hit ke prati adhik sahyogshil or patibaddh banaaegi
 Held also does not necessarily hold the central belief that ordinary people want to be more responsible in policy making and decision making on issues affecting their lives
 yadi ve saamaajik-aarthik maamalon or nitiyon ke nirdhaaran main bhaag lenaa nahin chahen to unhen iske liye baadhya karnaa uchit nahin mana ja saktaa
 Nevertheless, if the common people want to take their democratic tendencies beyond a threshold and start to interfere in the matter of basic freedom and rights, then what questions of democracy will happen, the supporters of the participation theory did not pay enough attention to such questions
 is
 cook or morgan ke anusaar sahabhaagi loktantr ko asli jama pehanaanaa utana aasaan nahin he jitna upree taur par prathit hota he
 For example, what should be the size and function of the participating unit, then how will the decisions taken at the local levels on the basis of active participation of citizens be coordinated and integrated with the interest of the entire nation? The policy matters of one local partner unit may be hostile to the other unit as well
 phir ek baat yah bhi he ki adhiktam sambhav sahabhaagita ke bal par liye gaye nirnay aavashyak nahin ki sarvaadhik kargar nirnay hon hi
 Supporters of participatory theory do not pay enough attention to issues of efficiency and effectiveness
 aam dharna ke vipareet loktantr ke vichaar ko marks or pashchavarti marxvaadi vichaarkon ne bhi sweekaar kar liya he
 So much so that their democracy-related conception is completely different from western liberal democratic conceptions
 chunki marxvaadiyon kaa maananaa he ki poonjivadi vyavastha main loktantric adhikaar sahi arth main aam janata ke paas na hokar sirf saadhan-sampann varg ke haath main hota he, isliye ve ek aise loktantr kii sthapana chaahate hai jo ‘janata kaa loktantr‘ ho
 In Marxist democracy, socialist democracy is established after the abolition of ownership over the means of production and controlling the economy by the proletariat
 marks udaaravaadi sanvaidhanik loktantr kaa aalochak tha kyonki uske anusaar poonjivadi loktantr kaa aadhaar ek aisi aarthik pranali hoti he jisamen utpaadan ke saadhan hameshaa puunjipati varg ke niyantran main hote hai
 This bourgeoisie keeps the government and the state system under its power by keeping it under the control of the political system
 rajya satta, adhikaar or visheshadhikaar purnatah usee varg ke paas hote hai or shramikvarg ke paas sirf naam kii swatantraaa or adhikaar hote hai
 The official class of the state, the court and the police force are also not the neutral but seekers of the sovereign class
 isliye, loktantr ek aisi shashan-pranali kaa rup akhriyaar kar letaa he jo shaasha varg kii satta or visheshadhikaar ko badhaava dene or ucch varg ke hiton ko saadhane ke kaam aata he
 In spite of this, Marx and Engels have accepted that even the moderate bourgeois democracy controlled by the thriving bourgeoisie can to some extent make historical claims to give real rights to its citizens and the working class can use it to organize the revolution of the proletariat
 can do
 udaaravaadi loktantron main aam matadhikaar kaa upyog sarvharavarg kii krantikari aandolan kii prishthbhumi taiyaar karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 Marxists certainly believe that violent revolutionary movements may not be required in some situations, but the possibility of such situations is slim
 agar samaajawaadee kranti ke lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye sansadeey maarg apanaaya bhi jaataa he to yah anya prakaar ke sangharshon main ek atirikt sahaayak upkaran hi ho saktaa he
 According to Marxist analysis, real democracy is possible only after the proletarian revolution to uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat, because the ideal of liberal bourgeois democracy can be of participation, but in reality the participation of the resourceless working class is not there
 apni rachana ‘da critic of da gotha program‘ main marks or angels ne apni avadharana ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ‘poonjivadi or samyavaadee samaaj ke bich main hi ek kaa duusare main roopantaran kii avadhi nihit hoti he
 Corresponding to this is a period of political transition in which the state has distinguished between totalitarianism and communism of the proletariat
 ve ise ek madhyavarti kaal maanate hai
 This results in the establishment of a communist society
 yah samajhnaa jaruri he ki karl marks or angenles ne adhinayakawad pad kaa prayog kis arth main kiya he
 In his view, each state has been the authoritarianism of the ruling social class
 poonjivadi vyavastha main yah varg sampann audyogic or vyapaaree burjua kaa tha jabaki unki apni avadharana vaala rajya kranti ke turant baad sarvhaara ke niyantran vaala rajya hoga or tab samaajawaadee punanirmaan kii prakriya shuru hogi jiskaa ant ek vargaheen samaaj kii sthapana main hoga
 Therefore, in his view, democracy and proletarian totalitarianism will run simultaneously, just as liberal democracy in the capitalist system is practically democracy and also the totalitarian ruler of the bourgeoisie of industrialists and business houses
 isiilie, marks or angels kaa kahana tha ki kranti or shramik varg ke aadhipaty ke pashchaat kii pranali ‘janata ke loktantr‘ kii pranali hogi
 He meant the mass population of the masses in place of a handful of rich bourgeoisie
 marks dwaara pratipaadit ‘janata kaa loktantr‘ kii pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai The creation of socialist societies further enhanced Marxist ideas, Lenin who established the first socialist state in Russia in 1917 introduced new interpretations of Marxist thought
 usne sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ko sweekaar kiya or samaajawaadee kranti ke iske mahatva par bal diya, lekin usne iske saath yah bhi jod diya ki sarvhaara varg kaa adhinayakawad vishaal sarvhaara sanghathan yaa samyavaadee dal dwaara hi prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 He described three stages of democracy: capitalist democracy, socialist democracy and communist democracy
 uske anusaar loktantr rajya kaa ek swaroop he or varg-vibhajit samaaj main sarkaar adhinayakawadi or loktantric donon hoti he
 It is democracy for one class and totalitarianism for another
 burjua varg chunki apane hit saadhan main poonjivadi pranali ko niyantrit or sanchalit karata he, isliye use satta se bedakhalkar samaajawaadee loktantr ko sthapit karnaa aavashyak he
 Lenin acknowledges that the newly established socialist state is as oppressive as the capitalist state
 sarvhaara varg ke shashan ko lagu karne ke liye yah aavashyak bhi he
 Since the bourgeoisie is very powerful, it becomes necessary for the proletariat to abolish the capitalist class by force in the early stages of socialist democracy
 sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ke samaksh do lakshya hote hai: According to Lenin, this task is mainly done by the communist party
 is tarah, lenin kii drushti main poonjivadi loktantr main sachcha loktantr nahin hota, jabaki sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad main purvaapeksh adhik loktantr hota he, kyonki yah bahusankhyak sarvhaara varg kaa shashan he
 He also claimed that eventually democracy would become unnecessary with the realization of true communism, as it would have no meaning in the context of that society
 marks, angels or lenin ke baad anek vichaarkon ne marxvad kii anek vyakhyaayein prastut kii he
 Among them are Edward Bernstein, Karl Cotsky, Rosa Lukjamvarg, etc
 edward bernstin kaa daawa he ki poonjeevaad kii marxvaadi vyakhya galat he or sarvhaara kaa adhinayakawad na to aavashyak he, na vaanchhneeya
 According to him, political democracy and liberal freedoms are more important
 lenin kii yah manyata sahi nahin he ki sarvhaara kaa adhinayakawad aavashyak he
 Bernstein argues that until the proletariat attains majority, socialist revolution is impossible and totalitarianism is no longer needed if it achieves majority

 • Democracy is simply a mechanism by which one of the small groups governs with minimal support from the public
 The elitist theory also believes that the elite classes - political parties, leaders, executives of big business houses, leaders of voluntary organizations and here It is necessary to have a consensus among the labor organizations so that the basic functioning of democracy is determined by non-responsible leaders

 dwapar yug main, ”mahakaul” jis samay “kailash parvat” ja rahe the, jate hue raste main unki mulaakaat ek vruddh stri se hui, usne baba ji se gantavya main jane kaa abhipraay poocha, vruddh stri ko jab babaaji kii ichha kaa pataa chalaa ki vah bhagwaan shiv se milane ja rahe hai to usne unhen maansarovar nadi ke kinare tapasya karne kii salaah di or mata parvati, se un tak pahunchne kaa upaay poochne ke liye kaha
 Babaji did exactly that and succeeded in meeting his purpose, Lord Shiva
 balyogi mahakaul ko dekhakar shivaji bahut prasann hue or unhone babaaji ko kalyug tak bhakton ke bich siddh pratik ke taur se puuje jane kaa aashirvad pradaan kiya or chir aayu tak unki chhavi ko balak kii chhavi ke taur par bane rahane kaa bhi aashirvad diya
 In Kali Yuga, Baba Balaknath ji was born in Gujarat, Kathiabad under the name of "dev"
 unki mata kaa naam lakshmi or pita kaa naam vaishno vaish tha, bachapan se hi babaaji ‘aadhyatm’ main leen rahete the
 Seeing this, his parents decided to marry him, but Babaji rejected his proposal and left the family and set out on the path of 'param Siddhi'
 or ek din junagarh kii girnaar pahari main unka saamana “swami dattatreya” se hua or yaheen par babaaji ne swami dattatreya se “ siddh” kii buniyadi shiksha grahan kari or “siddh” bane
 Since then, he came to be called "baba Balaknathji"
 babaaji ke do pruthk sakshya abhi bhi uplabdh hai jo ki unki upastithi ke abhi bhi pramaan hai jin main se ek he “ garuda kaa ped” yah ped abhi bhi shahatlai main maujuud he, isi ped ke neeche babaaji tapasya kiya karte the
 The second evidence is an old police station, located at "badsar" where cows were kept which had spoiled the crop of all the fields, the story of which is like this, a woman named 'ratno' , Had kept Babaji to guard his cows, in return for which Ratno used to give Babaji bread and lassi, it is believed that Babaji was so absorbed in his austerity that the cry given by Ratno Mr
 and buttermilk food was missing is not the same
 ek baar jab ratno babaaji kii aalochana kar rahi thi ki vah gaayon kaa thik se khyaal nahin rakhte jabaki ratno babaaji ke khaane pine kaa khub dhyaan rakhti hai
 Ratno had said this much that Babaji produced bread from the trunk of the tree and lassi from the ground
 babaaji ne sari umr brahmacharya kaa paalan kiya or isi baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue unki mahila bhakt ‘garbhagupha’ main pravesh nahin karti jo ki prakritik gupha main sthit he jahaan par babaaji tapasya karte hue antardhyaan ho gaye the

 How Vidyyasangi himself was the poet of the poet, how the congregation of eminent poets in the Rajya Sabha and the visiting poets used to call through the humor of continual poetry, its tableau is found in the text

 Bhojambandha's poetry is often well defined, the language is simple but inspired by the poetic style

 The prose is often in the form of a powder, there are short sentences, there is a complete lack of rigorous grammatical experiments

 For example- At some point during the Hemant period, Maharaj Bhoj was heating the Angithi, near him was the poet Kalidas
 kauthukavash raja ne kavi se angithi kaa varnan karne ko kaha
 The poet immediately presents an Arya: pakke lohe se bani hui yah hasanti bahul oohon se sushobhit kavi kii pratibha ke samaan he; chakravaak pakshi kaa priya se milan karaanevaali prabhaat vela kii bhanti yah sundar chakrakaar se mandit hai tathaa dhooma rahit agni se bhari hui yah chandra, uma or agni se sanyukt kii bhanti sushobhit he

 On the basis of the internal evidence of Bhojprabandh it can be said that the time of Ballal will be somewhere in the 16th century

 Vedic, mythological, tantric and folk religion influence Hindu Hinduism
 vaidic dharm main devataaon ke moort rup kii kalpana milti he
 According to Vedic belief, Moolashakti as a deity is contained in the various components of the universe
 ek hi chetana sabhi upaadaanon main he
 This consciousness or fire, like many sphurlings, are the manifestations of the same God
 
 The Vedic deities have been classified into three categories - Prithvasthaaniya, Asthasthastaniya and Diasthaaniya
 agni, vaayu or surya kramash: in teen kotiyon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 On the basis of these trinity, the first 33 and the subsequent 33 deities are envisaged
 33 devataaon ke naam or rup main granthbhed se bada antar he
 The list of 33 deities in the 'shatapatha Brahmana' is relatively different, with 8 vasu, 11 rudras, 12 adityas except the heavens and the earth are counted
 33 se adhik devataaon kii kalpana bhi ati praachin he
 The two mantras of the Rigveda mention 3339 deities
 is prakaar yadhyapi mularoop main vaidic devvaad akeshwarwad par aadhaarit he, kintu baad ko vishesh gunavachak sangyaaon dwaara inkaa is rup main vibhedikaran ho gaya ki unhone dhire dhire swatantra charitrik swaroop grahan kar liya
 His form became human or superhuman by virtue of folk faith, recognition and tradition, instead of being pure natural benevolent in character
 vedottar kaal main puranic tantric sahitya or dharm tathaa lok dharm kaa vaidic devvaad par itnaa prabhaav padaa ki vaidic devtaa parvarti kaal main apana swaroop or gun chhodkar lokmanas me sarvatha bhinn rup main hi pratishthapit hue
 In later times many Vedic deities attained the position of secondary and new deities were also imagined
 is paristhiti se bhartiya devvaad kaa swaroop or mahatv apekshaakrit adhik vyapak ho gaya
 Any worshiper in Hinduism was free to choose his deity according to his interest
 tathaapi shastron main is baat kii vyavastha bhi bataai gai ki kaary or uddeshy ke anusaar bhi devtaa kii upasana kii ja sakati he
 Thus Vishnu and Indra, the Gods of Nripe, Agni, Surya, Brahma, Shiva, the Gods of Brahmins are determined
 ek anya vyavastha ke anusaar vishnu devataaon ke, rudra brahmanon ke, chandramaa athwa som yakshon or gandharvo ke, saraswati vidyadharon ke, hari saadhy sampradaywaalon ke, parvati kinnaron ke, brahma or mahadev rishiyon ke, surya, vishnu or uma manuon ke, brahma brahmachariyon ke, ambika vaikhanson ke, shiv yatiyon ke, ganpati yaa ganesh kushmandon yaa ganon ke vishesh devtaa nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai
 But this type of discrimination is not targeted for ordinary householders
 unke liye sabhi devtaa poojaneey hai
 The Hindu deity is believed to have originated from Brahma
 tridev main brahma pratham hai
 According to Indian belief, Brahma is the best and he is the creator
 ve ek hai or unki ichha ki main bahut ho jaaon hi vishwa kii samruddhi kaa kaaran he
 In the Mandook Upanishad, Brahma has been called the first of the gods, the doer and protector of the world
 karta ke rup main vaidic sahitya main bramha kaa parichay vibhinn naamon se diya gaya he, yatha vishwakarman, brahmaswati, hiranyagarbha, prajapati, brahma or brahma
 Apart from these names in the Puranas, Dhata, Vidhata, Pitamah etc
 also came into vogue
 vaidic sahitya kii apeksha puranic sahitya main brahma kaa mahatv gaun he
 Brahma did not get the importance of worshiping Vishnu, Shiva, even Ganapati and Surya, but Brahma as the creator of Vedic deities is well accepted and in this way he is the one who establishes the heavens and the earth
 And live in space
 ye samast vishwa or samast praaniyon ko apni bhujaaon main aabaddh kiye rahete he
 Thus Atharva is the only form of Brahma in the Rigveda
 maanvi rup main inaki kalpana bhi badi pracheen he
 He is also accepted as the paramount deity in the Atharva and Bajasaneyi Samhita
 shatapath brahman main unhen devon ke pita tathaa isi granth main anyatra kaha gaya he ki sristi ke aadi main bhi brahma kaa astitv tha
 In Maitrayani Samhita, there is a story of Prajapati being enamored with his daughter Ushas, which is elaborated in later literature
 is katha ke prati naitik drushtikon ke kaaran parvarti samaaj main brahma kii manyata ghatati gai
 Brahma's nature also hindered his popularity
 sampradaay devtaa ke rup main ve vishnu or shiv kii tarah lokapriy na hue tathaa tapas or yajna ke vishesh himachati hone ke kaaran bhakthi ke vishesh paatr na ho sake
 At the same time, he was also compassionate on Asuras and Devas opposing Vishnu and Shiva, so both sects have ignored them
 brahma dhire dhire hindu purakatha main itnaa mahatvaheen ho jate hai ki jaisaa madhu kaitabha kii katha se pataa chalata he, ve apni hi suraksha main asamarth siddh hote hai tathaa vishnu kii krupa kii apeksha karte hai
 Both the Vaishnavite and Shaivite sects consider their deities Vishnu and Shiva to be the deities of Brahma
 is prakaar ke drushtikon kaa prabhaav bhartiya dharm par yah padaa ki us devtaa ke aadhaar par bharat main na to koi dharmik sampradaay khadaa ho sakaa or na upasya dev ke rup main brahma kii pruthak murtiyan hi prachurtaa se sthapit hui
 The temples of Brahma are very rare
 shastravidhan ke anusaar upasya dev ke rup main brahma kaa puja keval vaidic brahmanon ko hi kerani chahie
 According to Puranas and Shilpashastras, Brahma is the Chaturmukh
 inke chaar haathon main akshamala, shruva, pustak or kamandalu pradarshit karaane kaa vidhaan he
 There are also armaments of Brahma from the texts
 yugabhed ke anusaar inhen kali main kamalasana, dwapar main viranchi, treta main pitamah or satyuga main brahma ke naam se kaha gaya he
 She has two powers Savitri and Saraswati
 savitri kaa swaroop vidhaan brahma ke anuroop hi nishchit kiya gaya he
 The Ashta Pratiharas of Brahma are known as Satya, Dharma, Priyodbhava, Yajna Vijay, Yajnabhadraka, Bhava and Vibhava
 puranic manyataon ke anusaar sristi kii sthiti main vishnu kii ‘ichha’ hi pradhan he
 Vishnu maintains the universe with the help of his power Lakshmi
 vishnu ‘ichha’ ke pratik hai, lakshmi ‘bhuti’ or ‘kriya’ kii
 In this way, desire, 'bhuti' and 'kriya' give birth to the Shakgunas
 shadgun gyaan, aishwarya, shakti, bal, veery or tejas hai
 These are the products of the universe
 inhen main se do do gunon se teen moort rup banate hai jo lok main sankarshan, pradhyumna or aniruddh ke naam se prasiddh hai
 Vasudeva has all the qualities
 aadi vasudev ke aadhaar par guptyuga main chaturvishti vishnuon kii kalpana kii gai
 Their names are Vasudev, Keshav, Narayana, Madhav, Purushottam, Adhokaj, Sankarshan, Govind, Vishnu, Madhusudan, Achutha, Upendra, Pradyuman, Trivikram, Narasimha, Janardhana, Vaman, Sridhar, Anirudh, Hrishikesh, Padmanabh, Damodar, Hari and He is Krishna
 vishnu ke avatar bhartiya dharm or aasthaa par vishesh prabhaav rakhte hai
 The spirit of avatarism is Vedic
 ‘shatapath’ or ‘aitarey’ brahmanon main vishnu ke matsay, kurm or varah avtaron kii charchaa he
 There is a big difference between the incarnations of Vishnu and their order, etc
, but the number of incarnations is generally considered ten
