 It is considered the best creation of Plato
 plato ne ‘republic’ main vibhinn vyaktiyon ke madhya hue lambe sanvaadon ke madhyam se spasht kiya he ki hamaara nyaay se sarokaar hona chahie
 The central questions and subtitles of the Republic are related to justice, in which he emphasizes the duty of individuals to establish justice
 plato kehete hai ki manushya kii aatma ke teen mukhya tatva hai – trishna yaa kshudha, saahas, buddhi yaa gyaan 
 If all these elements are integrated in a person's soul, then that person will become a judge
 ye teenon gun kuchhek maatra main sabhi manushyon main paae jate hai lekin prayek manushya main in teenon gunon main se kisi ek gun kii pradhanta rahati he
 Therefore, there are three classes based on these three qualities in the state
 pehla, utpaadak varg – aarthik kaary, doosraa, sainik varg – raksha kaary, teesraa, shaasha varg – darshanik kaary 
 According to Plato, when all classes will do their work and will not interfere in the work of others and do their duty, then justice will be established in society and state

 He inspired his husbands to do sage Gautama

 Pleased with his worship, Ganesha appeared and asked him to ask for the groom, those Brahmins said - 'prabhu! If you are happy with us then somehow get Rishi Gautama out of this ashram
 ' unki yah baat sunakar ganeshji ne unhen aisa var maangane ke liye samajhaayaa
 But he remained firm on his request
 antat ganeshji ko vivash hokar unki baat manani padi
 To keep the mind of his devotees, he took the form of a weak cow and started living in the field of sage Gautama
 gaay ko fasal charate dekhakar rishi badi narmi ke saath haath main trin lekar use haankane ke liye lapke
 As soon as those trunks were touched, that cow fell there itself
 ab to bada haahaakaar machaa
 All Brahmins gathered and called Sage Gautam, and started to condemn Rishi Gautama
 rishi gautam is ghatana se bahut aashcharyachakit or duhkhi the
 Now all those Brahmins said that you should leave this ashram and go somewhere else
 go-hatyare ke nikat rahane se hamen bhi paap lagegaa
 Being compelled, the sage Gautama started living with his wife Ahilya a curse away from there
 kintu un brahmanon ne vahaan bhi unka rahanaa dubhar kar diya
 They started saying - 'now you have no right to do the work of Vedas and Yajnadi due to cow slaughter
 ' atyant anunay bhav se rishi gautam ne un brahmanon se prarthana kii ki aap log mere praayshchit or uddhaar kaa koi upaay bataaen
 Then he said- 'gautam! You can revolve the whole earth thrice by telling your sins everywhere to everyone
 phir lautakar yahan ek maheene tak vrath karo
 After this, after doing 101 circumambulation of 'brahmagiri' you will be purified or bring Gangaji here and bathe with water and worship Shiva with one crore earthly Shivalingas

 brahmanon ke kathananusaar maharishi gautam ve saare kaary puure karke patni ke saath purnatah tallin hokar bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana karne lage
 Pleased with this, Lord Shiva appeared and asked him to ask for the groom
 maharishi gautam ne unase kaha- 'bhagavan main yahi chahta hoon ki aap mujhe go-hatya ke paap se mukt kar den
 'lord Shiva said-' Gautam! You are completely sinless
 go-hatya kaa aparaadh tum par chal purvak lagaaya gaya tha
 i want to punish the Brahmins of your ashram who have done this deceitfully
 ' On this Maharishi Gautam said that Lord! i have received your darshan for his sake only
 ab unhen meraa paramahit samajhakar un par aap krodh na karen
 Many sages, sages and devas gathered there, approving Gautam's talk and prayed to Lord Shiva to stay there forever

 jab is ilaake main sikandar mahaan kii jeet hui to in parvaton ko unani bhashaa main 'kaukasosh indikaush' yani 'bhartiya parvat' bulaayaa jane laga
 Later they were named 'hindu Kush', 'hindu Kuh' and 'kuh-e-hindu'
 'kuh' yaa 'koh' kaa matlab to farsi main 'pahaad' hota he lekin 'kush' ke matlab ko lekar vivaad he
 According to Ibn Battuta in 1333 AD, it meant 'to kill'

 Conversely, according to some scholars, 'kush' is simply another form of 'kuh', or a distorted form of 'hindu Kash' or 'hindu Kesh', which means 'border of India'
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki yah 'kaukasosh indikaush' vaale unani naam kaa do hazaar varshon ke baad kaa bigadaa hua rup ho
 Note that there is also a mountain range called Hindu Raj between the Hindu Kush and Karakoram mountains
