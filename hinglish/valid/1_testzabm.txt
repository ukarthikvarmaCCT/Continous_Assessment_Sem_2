 a famous Kakwin poem written in the Kavi language of ancient Java and Bali
 spartacas roman samrajya ke khilaaf ek vyapak das vidroh main jise teesraa das yuddh kaha jaataa he, daason kaa sabase ullekhneey netaa tha
 Not much is known about Spartacus beyond the events of the war and the available historical details sometimes become contradictory and may not always be reliable
 vah ek nipun sainya netaa tha
 The struggle of Spartacus has taken new meaning for modern writers since the 19th century, which is seen as a battle fought by the downtrodden to gain their freedom against the elite slave owners
 spartacas kaa vidroh kai aadhunik raajnneetik or saahitiyik lekhakon ke liye preranadayak siddh hua he, jisase spartacas pracheen or aadhunik, donon samskritiyon main ek lok nayak ban kar ubhara he
 Ancient sources believe that Spartacus was a Thracian
 plutark ne use "khanaabadosh tabake kaa thresian" varnit kiya he
 Appian states that he was "a Thracian by birth, once a soldier of Rome, but has since been taken prisoner and sold as a gladiator
 Flores called him a man Described as "a mercenary Thracian soldier who joins the Roman army and after the soldier becomes a fugitive and a bandit and then becomes a gladiator in view of his power "
 a few authors refer to the Thracian tribe Medi, which dwells on the south-western region of Thrace in historical times
 plutark bhi likhte hai ki spartacas kii patni, jo medi janajati kii ek nabiya thi, uske saath ghulaam bana lee gayi thi
 The name Spartacus is evidenced in the Black Sea region: the King of the Thracian dynasty of the Cimerian Bosporus and Pontus bore the name and a Thracian "sparta" "spardacus" or "spradakos", father of Suthes i of Odrisse, is also known
 
 bhinn sroton or unki vyakhya ke anusaar, spartacas yaa to roman fuj kaa ek sahaayak tha jise baad main das bana liya gaya yaa phir fuj dwaara banaaya gaya ek bandi tha
 Spartacus was trained at the Gladiator School in Lentulus Batiatus, near Kapua

 The conspiracy failed but about 70 men seized the kitchen tools, left the school while fighting and captured several vehicles loaded with gladiator weapons and armor
 batch kar bhaage hue daason ne us choti tukdi ko parajeet kar diya jise unke peeche bheja gaya tha
 They looted areas around Kapua, recruited several other slaves into their contingent and eventually camped in a more protective position on Mount Vesuvius
 mukt hone ke baad bhaage hue gladiatoron ne spartacas or do francisi daason - cricksus or onomouse - ko apane netaa ke rup main chunaa
 Roman writers, however, speculate that these slaves belonged to a homogeneous group whose leader was Spartacus and may have applied their own hierarchical system of military leadership to the spontaneous organization of slaves, and placed other slave leaders in subordinate positions
 cricksus or onomouse - or baad main, kastas - ke padon ko sroton dwaara spasht rup se nirdhaarit nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Rome's response was interrupted by the absence of the Roman army, which had already been implicated in the rebellion in Spain and the Third Mithridetic War
 iske alaava, rome ne is vidroh ko kisi yuddh ke bajaaye ek pulisia maamla samajha
 rome ne pretor gayus clodius glberas kii kaman main naagarik sena ko bheja, jisane pahaad par daason ko gher liya, jiskaa andeshaa tha ki bhukhmaree se majaboor hokar das aatmasamarpan kar denge
 He was quite surprised when he saw that Spartacus had ropes made of vines, with which he, along with his comrades, came down from the side of the volcanic rock and attacked the unprotected Roman camp and killed most of them
 
 daason ne duusare abhiyaan ko bhi parajeet kar diya or pretor commander ko lagbhag pakad hi liya tha, uske sahyogi kii hatya kar di or sainya upkarnon par kabja kar liya
 With these successes, one slave later joined the Spartacan army and together "many shepherds and shepherds of that region did the same and their total number increased to 70,000
" in jhadpon main spartacas ek utkrisht ranneetijna sabit hua, jiskaa matlab tha ki uske paas sena kaa purv anubhav tha
 Although slaves lacked military training, they demonstrated efficient use of available local material and unusual tactics when confronted with disciplined Roman armies

 The distance between these places and subsequent events suggest that the slaves functioned in two groups headed by Spartacus and other leaders other than Crixus

 These defeats are depicted by Appian and Plutarch in various ways in the two most extensive histories of war

 Crassus was entrusted with eight contingents, approximately 40,000–50,000 trained Roman soldiers, over whom he applied harsh, even ruthless discipline and revived the punishment of unit destruction

 71 BC By the end of the year, Spartacus was camping near the strait of Messina in the Regium
 plutark ke anusaar, spartacas ne silisia ke samudri daakuon ke saath ek sauda kiya tha ki ve use or uske 2000 saathiyon ko sicili pahunchaayenge jahaan uskaa iraadaa ek das vidroh bhadakaane or sahaayta paane kaa tha
 However, he was betrayed by the bandits, who took payment from him and then left
 kuch sroton kaa ullekh he ki vidrohiyon dwaara vahaan se batch nikalne ke liye bede or jahaaj banane kaa prayaas hua lekin krasss ne anirdisht upaay kiye taaki yah sunishchit ho jaae ki vidrohi sicili naa ja paayen or unhen apana prayaas chhodana padaa

 The rebels were besieged and their supplies cut off

 While Crassus feared that Pompeo's arrival would make it difficult for him to take credit for the work, Spartacus tried to execute an agreement with Crassus but was unsuccessful
 jab krasss ne inkaar kar diya, to spartacas kii sena kaa ek hissaa brutium main patelia ke pashchim kii ore pahaado main bhaag gaya or krasss kii sena ne uskaa peechha kiya
 When the troops surrounded a portion of the rebels separated from the main army, discipline broke out between the Spartacus forces and small groups began to attack the incoming troops independently
 spartacas ne ab apni sena ko failaa diya or apni puri takat ko fuj ke khilaaf aakhri baar utaara jisamen daason kaa puri tarah safaya kar diya gaya or unke adhikansh hisse ko ranbhumi main maar diya gaya
 What happened to Spartacus himself is unknown, as his body was not found, but historians say that he too was killed in a fight with his comrades
 krasss kii fuj dwaara bandi banaae gaye chah hazaar daason ko rome se lekar kapua tak appiyan maarg par cross par chadha diya gaya
 Classical historians are divided on what Spartacus intended
 jabaki plutark likhte hai ki spartacas keval uttar kii ore sicilpine gul bhaagna chahta tha or apane saathiyon ko unke ghar bhejnaa chahta tha, appiyan or florus ne likhaa he ki vah khud rome par kabja karne kaa iraadaa rakhata tha
 Appian also states that he later abandoned this goal, reflecting Roman fears
 spartacas kii koi bhi karrwai yah sanket nahin detii he ki vah roman samaaj ko sudhaarna athwa das pratha kii samaapti karnaa chahta tha, jaisaa ki kai kaalpanik vivaranon main chitrit kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye 1960 kii film spartacas main
 73 BC The latter half of 72 BC The facts based on the events of the first half of the year suggest that there were groups of slaves who were operating freely, and Plutarch's statement that some of the escaped slaves preferred to loot in Italy instead of going to the Alps, modern writers Predicted a factional division under which the slaves who were with Spartacus wanted to go to the Alps and become independent, while the slaves under Crixus were the South
 The sages wanted to continue looting while living in Italy

 Architecturalis, the first reformist book by Jwingli, was published in 1522 AD
 pope adreyan chaturth ne jurik nivaasiyon ko jwingli kaa parityag kar dene kii ajna di
 But he gave a full account of the "sarsath Theses" in his confirmation of the opinion and explained his position so strongly that the city gave its approval to that philosophy and severed its connection with Rome

 The fasts and marital life of the priests were also attacked
 1523 i main usne bern main ek rome padri ko saarvajanik sabha main saidhantik vigrah kii chunauti di
 The dispute lasted 19 days and eventually became a follower of Burnt Jwingli
 2 april 1524 i ko, jwingli ne aina renhard se vivaah kiya
 In 1525, he published his commentary on Truth and False Religion, in which the underlying idea also took conflict with Martin Luther
 donon kaa matbhed kuch sudhaar siddhanton ke sambandh main, visheshtya lards sapar kii vichaardhaara par tha
 Jwingli rejected the theory of material conversion and the actual presence of Jesus and emphasized the higher authority of scriptures
 usne dharmavigyaan tathaa anushaasan donon main sudhaar kii aavashyaktaa kaa lakshya rakhaa
 In 1529, a conference of promoters of reform took place in Marburg to resolve the differences

 The followers of Jwingli disbanded and the Protestant Church became two branches

 Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was the first Vice President and Second President of India
 ve bhartiya samskruti ke samvahak, prakhyat shikshavid, mahaan darshanik or ek aasthavan hindu vichaarak the
 Due to his qualities, the Government of India honored him with the highest honor Bharat Ratna in 1954
 unka janmdin bharat main shikshak diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was born on 5 September 1888 in Tirutani village, Tamil Nadu, which is about 64 km from the then Madras
 jis parivaar main unhone janm liya vah ek brahman parivaar tha
 His place of birth has also been noted as a holy pilgrimage place
 radhakrishnan ke purakhe pehle kabhi 'sarvapalli' naamak gram main rahete the or 18veen shatabdi ke madhya main unhone tirutani gram kii ore nishkraman kiya tha
 But his ancestors wanted that there should always be a realization of the village of his birthplace along with his name
 isi kaaran unke parijan apane naam ke purv 'sarvapalli' dhaaran karne lage the
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was a child of a poor but learned Brahmin
 unke pita kaa naam 'sarvapalli veeraswami' or mata kaa naam 'sitamma' tha
 His father worked in the revenue department
 un par bahut bade parivaar ke bharan-poshan kaa daayitv tha
 Veeraswamy had five sons and a daughter
 radhakrishnan kaa sthaan in santatiyon main doosraa tha
 His father was discharging the family with great difficulty
 is kaaran balak radhakrishnan ko bachapan main koi vishesh sukh praapt nahin hua
 Radhakrishnan's childhood was spent in religious places like Tirutani and Tirupati
 unhone pratham aath varsh tirutani main hi gujaarey
 Although his father was old-minded and had religious sentiments, he sent Radhakrishnan to study at the Christian missionary institution Lutheran Mission School, Tirupati between 1896–1900
 phir agle 4 varsh kii unki shiksha vellore main hui
 He then studied at Madras Christian College, Madras
 vah bachapan se hi medhaavi the
 During these 12 years of study, Radhakrishnan also remembered important portions of the Bible
 iske liye unhen vishisht yogyata kaa sammaan pradaan kiya gaya
 At this age, he also studied Veer Savarkar and Swami Vivekananda
 unhone 1902 main metric str kii pariksha uteern kii or unhen chaatravrutti bhi praapt hui
 After this he passed the Faculty of Arts examination in first class in 1904
 unhen manovigyaan, itihaas or ganit vishay main vishesh yogyata kii tippanee bhi ucch praptankon ke kaaran mili
 Apart from this, Christian College, Madras also gave him a scholarship
 darshanashastra main em0e0 karne ke pashchaat 1916 main ve madras residency college main darshanashastra ke sahaayak praadhyaapak niyukt hue
 Later he was also a professor in the same college
 dow radhakrishnan ne apane lekhon or bhaashanon ke madhyam se vishwa ko bhartiya darshan shaastra se parichit karaayaa
 His articles were praised all over the world
 us samay madras ke brahman pariwaron main kam umr main hi shaadi sampann ho jaati thi or radhakrishnan bhi uske apwaad nahin rahe
 In 1903, at the age of 16, he was married to Sivakamu, the sister of a distant relationship
 us samay unki patni kii aayu maatr 10 varsh kii thi
 So, after three years, his wife started living with him
 yadhyapi unki patni sivaakamu ne paramparaagat rup se shiksha praapt nahin kii thi, lekin unka telegu bhashaa par acha adhikaar tha
 She could also write and read English
 1908 main radhakrishnan dampati ko santaan ke rup main putree kii prapti hui
 In 1908, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the first class and got special qualification in philosophy
 shaadi ke 6 varsh baad hi 1909 main unhone kala main snatakottar pariksha bhi uteern kar lee
 The subject of his philosophy was philosophy
 ucch adhyayan ke dauraan vah apni nijee aamadani ke liye bacchon ko tution padhaane kaa kaam bhi karte rahe
 In 1908 he also wrote a research article to obtain the title of MA
 is samay unki aayu maatr bees varsh kii thi
 This increased his knowledge of the scriptures
 sheeghra hi unhone vedon or upanishdon kaa bhi gahan adhyayan kar liya
 Apart from this, he also studied Hindi and Sanskrit language very interestingly
 shiksha kaa prabhaav jahaan prayek vyakti par nishchit rup se padataa he, vahiin shaikshik santhaan kii gunvattta bhi apana prabhaav chhodti he
 At that time Western values of life were deeply instilled within the students by Christian institutions
 yahi kaaran he ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon main adhyayan karte hue radhakrishnan ke jivan main ucch gun samahit ho gayi
 But there was also another change in them which was due to Christian institutions
 kuch log hindutvvaadi vichaaron ko hey drushti se dekhte the or unki aalochana karte the
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan took his criticism as a challenge and started to study Hindu scriptures deeply
 dow radhakrishnan yah jaananaa chaahate the ki vastutah kis samskruti ke vichaaron main chetanta he or kis samskruti ke vichaaron main jadta he? tab swaabhaavik antarpragna dwaara is baat par dridhtaa se vishwaas karnaa armbh kar diya ki bharat ke duurastha sthanon par rahane vaale garib tathaa anpadh vyakti bhi pracheen satya ko jaanate the
 For this reason Radhakrishnan came to know comparatively that Indian spirituality is very rich and criticisms of Hinduism by Christian missionaries are baseless
 isse inhone yah nishkarsh nikaala ki bhartiya samskruti dharm, gyaan or satya par aadhaarit he jo praani ko jivan kaa sachcha sandesh detii he
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan had well known that life is very short but the happiness prevailing in it is uncertain
 is kaaran vyakti ko sukh-dukh main sambhaav se rahanaa chaiye
 In fact, death is an unshakable truth, which makes the rich poor all their grass and does not make any kind of class distinction
 sachcha gyaan vahi he jo aapke andar ke agyaan ko samaapt kar saktaa he
 a life of simplistic contentment is better than the egoistic life of the rich, in whom dissatisfaction resides
 ek shant mastishk behatar he, taaliyon kii un gadgadahaton se; jo sansadon evam darbaron main sunaayi detii hai
 In fact, this is why Dr
 Radhakrishnan was able to understand the moral values of Indian culture, because he wanted to test the truth of the criticisms made by the missionaries themselves
 isiilie kaha gaya he ki aalochanaayen parishuddhi kaa kaary karti hai
 All mothers want to see higher values in their children
 isi kaaran ve bacchon ko ishwar par vishwaas rakhane, paap se dur rahane evam musiibat main phase logon kii madad karne kaa paath padhaati hai
 Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan also learned that respect for all religions has been taught in Indian culture and the sense of equality for all religions is also a unique identity of Hindu culture
 is prakaar unhone bhartiya samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan ko samajha or uske kaafii nazadik ho gayi
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan considered the whole world as a school
 unka maananaa tha ki shiksha ke dwaara hi maanav mastishk kaa sadupyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the world should manage education as a single entity
 britain ke edinbura vishvavidhyalay main diye apane bhaashan main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne kaha tha- "maanav ko ek hona chahie
 The complete goal of human history is the liberation of mankind only when the basis of the policies of the countries is to try to establish peace all over the world
 " dow radhakrishnan apni buddhi se paripurna vyakhyaaon, anandadaayi abhivyaktiyon or halki gudgudane vaali kahaniyon se chaatro ko mantramugdh kar dete the
 He also used to motivate his students to adopt high moral values in their conduct
 vah jis bhi vishay ko padhaate the, pehle swayan uskaa gahan adhyayan karte the
 He used to make even a serious subject like philosophy, simple, interesting and dear to his style
 1909 main 21 varsh kii umr main dow radhakrishnan ne madras presidency college main kanishtha vyaakhyaata ke taur par darshan shaastra padhaanaa prarambh kiya
 It was his best fortune that he got a livelihood suited to his nature
 yahan unhone 7 varsh tak na keval adhyaapan kaary kiya apitu swayan bhi bhartiya darshan or bhartiya dharm kaa gaharaai se adhyayan kiya
 In those days, it was necessary for the lecturer that he should also get training for teaching
 isi kaaran 1910 main radhakrishnan ne shikshan kaa prashikshan madras main lenaa armbh kar diya
 At this time, his salary was only 37 rupees
 darshan shaastra vibhaag ke tatkaaleen profesar radhakrishnan ke darshan shastreey gyaan se kaafii abhibhoot hue
 They allowed him to be absent from philosophy classes
 lekin iske badale main yah shart rakhi ki vah unke sthaan par darshanashastra kii kakshaon main padhaa den
 Then Radhakrishna gave thirteen such impressive lectures to his classmates, which surprised even those learners
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki unki vishay par gahari pakad thi, darshan shaastra ke sambandh main drushtikon spasht tha or vyaakhyaan dete samay unhone upyukt shabdon kaa chayan bhi kiya tha
 a short booklet titled "essential Elements of Psychology" by Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was also published in 1912 which was a collection of his lectures given in class
 is pustika ke dwaara unki yah yogyata pramanit hui ki "prayek pad kii vyakhya karne ke liye unke paas shabdon kaa atul bhandar to he hi, unki samaran shakti bhi atyant vilakshan he
 " jab dow radhakrishnan europe evam america pravaas se punah bharat laute to yahan ke vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon ne unhen maanad oopaadhiyaan pradaan kar unki vidvatta kaa sammaan kiya
 In the winter of 1928, he first met Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru when he came to Calcutta to attend the annual session of the Congress Party
 yadhyapi sarvapalli radhakrishnan bhartiya shaikshik seva ke sadsy hone ke kaaran kisi bhi raajnneetik sambhaashan main hissedari nahin kar sakate the, tathaapi unhone is varjana kii koi parvaah nahin kii or bhaashan diya
 In 1929, he was invited by the 'university of Manchester' to give lectures
 inhone maanchester evam landan main kai vyaakhyaan diye
 The following institutional service functions are seen in the scope of their educational achievements- sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne aisa hi kiya or thik raatri 12 baje apane sambodhan ko viraam diya
 None other than Pandit Nehru and Radhakrishnan were aware of this
 azaadi ke baad unase aagrah kiya gaya ki vah mathrubhumi kii seva ke liye vishisht rajdoot ke rup main soviet sangh ke saath rajanyik kaaryon kii purti karen
 Thus, he was chosen as the new successor of Vijayalakshmi Pandit
 pandit nehru ke is chayan par kai vyaktiyon ne aashcharya vyakt kiya ki ek darshanashastri ko rajanyik sevaaon ke liye kyon chunaa gaya? unhen yah sandeh tha ki doctor radhakrishnan kii yogyataayen saunpi gai zimmedaari ke anukool nahin hai
 But Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan later proved that he was the best Indian diplomat appointed in Moscow
 ve ek gaiyr paramparawaadi rajanyik the
 Mantras which were late at night, they used to participate in them till 10 o'clock in the night, because after that their sleeping time was over
 jab radhakrishnan ek shikshak the, tab bhi ve niyamon ke daayaron main nahin bandhe the
 He used to come 20 minutes late to class and leave ten minutes earlier
 inkaa kahana tha ki kaksha main inhen jo vyaakhyaan dena hota tha, vah 20 minute ke paryaapt samay main sampann ho jaataa tha
 Even after this, he remained the beloved and respected teacher of the students
 1952 main soviet sangh se aane ke baad doctor radhakrishnan uparashtrapati nirvaachit kiye gayi
 a new post of Vice President was created under the Constitution
 nehru ji ne is pad hetu radhakrishnan kaa chayan karke punah logon ko chaunkaa diya
 He wondered why no Congress party politician was elected for the post
 uparashtrapati ke rup main radhakrishnan ne rajyasabha main adhyaksh kaa padbhaar bhi sambhaala
 In 1952, he became the Vice President of India
 baad main pandit nehru kaa yah chayan bhi sarthak siddh hua, kyonki uparashtrapati ke rup main ek gaiyr raajnneetijna vyakti ne sabhi raajnneetigyon ko prabhavit kiya
 All the members of Parliament appreciated him for his work
 inaki sadashyata, dridhtaa or vinodi swabhaav ko log aaj bhi yaad karte hai
 The birthday of Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the second but unique President of our country, is celebrated every year as 'teacher's Day'
 is din samast desh main bharat sarkaar dwaara shreshth shikshakon ko puraskaar bhi pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Although he was conferred with the title of "sir" by the British Empire in 1931, his justification for Dr
 Radhakrishnan had ended after attaining independence
 jab ve uparashtrapati ban gayi to swatantra bharat ke pratham raashtrapati dow rajendra prasad ji ne 1954 main unhen unki mahaan darshanik va shaikshik uplabdhiyon ke liye desh kaa sarvocch alankaran bharat ratna pradaan kiya

 Some birds of the bird class are predators
 kuch to shikaar ko kha jaati hai or kuch uchit prashikshan se shikaar ko pakadakar paalak ke paas le aati he
 Such prey are also small animals like small birds, hares and rabbits
 shikari chidiyaan pedo par rahanevaale pakshi hai, jo hawa main paryaapt oonchaai tak ud lete hai
 Their nails are very sharp and crooked
 inaki chonch tedi or majboot hoti he
 His eyes are very sharp
 sabhi mansabhakshi chidiyon main se adhikansh jinda shikaar karti hai or kuch murdaakhor bhi hoti he
 a feature of predatory birds is that their females are larger and more adventurous in height than males
 shikari pakshiyon ke teen pramukh kul hai, par saadharantaya inhen bade pankhawali or chote pankhawali chidiyon main vibhakt karte hai
 The first variety is called "sihachashm" or black-eyed and the second variety is called "gulabchashm" or yellow-eyed
 jo shikari chidiyaan paali jaati hai, unamem baj, baheri, shaheen, turamati, charag, lagar, vaccin, vaasa, shikara or shikarchaa, biisra, dhooti tathaa jurra pramukh hai 
 In different countries, such as Europe, America, Africa, China and India, there are different methods of trapping predator birds
 bharat main jo tareeke kaam main aate hai, unheen kaa sankshipt vivaran yahan diya ja rahaa he : The method that Northern hill people adopt is simple and effective enough
 in pahari logon ke makaanon kii chhaten nichi or sapaat hoti he tathaa dhuaan nikalne ke liye chat main chota sooraakh bana hota he
 On top of that hole, place the chakor in a rope and keep the rope
 chakor vahaan fadafadaata he or is prakaar upar udate hue shikari pakshiyon kaa dhyaan apni ore aakarshith karata he
 The hunting bird approaches Chakor to catch the fluttering Chakor
 shikari chidiya or chakor donon ko khinchakar phasaanewaala sooraakh ke munh par laata he or haath se shikari chidiya ko pakad letaa he
 Another method is "do gaja ritual"
 isamen do gaj kaa ek jaal, 2 gaj ́ 4 gaj maap kaa hota he, jo lagbhag do gaj lambey baans ke do ballon main bandhaa hota he
 The mesh is made of fine, black thread
 jaal ke madhya se do teen foot kii duuri par, ek khunte main jinda chidiya chaare ke rup main bandhi rahati he
 When that tied bird flutters, the predatory bird is attracted to it, pounces on it and gets trapped in the water
 yadi shikari chidiya chaare ko pakad leti he or jaal main nahi fasati, tab shikari chidiya ko ghabaraakar use jaal main fasaa lete hai
 An interesting way of trapping Lagar is seen by the author himself
 isamen chil kii sahaayta lee jaati he
 The eagle's eye is so tightly tied that he can only look at the sky
 uske pair main oon kaa ek gola band diya jaataa he, jisamen ek sarakaphanda laga rahata he
 In the field, where the lug is seen, the eagle is released
 lagar oon ke ke gaale ko pakadaney kii koshish main chil ke saath jujh jaataa he or donon ladate ladate dharti par aa girte hai or phasaanewaala lagar ko pakad letaa he
 Always tries to snatch the eagle prey
 ek anya reeti "pinjadaa reeti" he
 a live bird is tied in an open cage, and the cage is often covered with a hoop made of horse hair
 ye fande sarak fande hote he
 The bird hunts near the cage and gets trapped in these traps
 fande ko majbootee se bandhaa rahanaa chahie or shikari chidiya ko pakadakar fande se jald nikaal lene ke liye, nikat main koi aadmi sadaa taiyaar rahanaa chahie, varanaa shikari chidiya kaa pair yaa pankh tut ja saktaa he
 One method is the "bandage method" used by traffickers
 isamen phasaanewaala dekhtaa he ki pravaas ke samay shikari chidiya kis raste se aati jaati he
 Many traps, measuring 6 feet 'by 300 feet', are spread on the mountain peaks or crates in the way through which the bird comes
 udati hui shikari chidiya un jaalan main fas jaati he, kyonki yah chidiya pahari chotiyon yaa kooton se upar uthakar udne kaa ksht nahin karti
 After catching predator sparrows, they are blinded for a few days, otherwise they will not sit on the wrist
 iske liye yaa to unki aankhon par pattee band di jaati he, yaa unki ankhe si di jaati hai, yaa topi pahana di jaati he
 Two types of caps are shown in Figure 1
 and 2

 seene main nichle palkon main taagaa lagaakar use sir ke sheersh se baandh dete hai
 The second method is more in practice than the first method
 dekhne main duusari vidhi avashya kuch krur maaloom detii he, par isse chidiyon ke palkon ko koi nuksaan nahin hota
 Here, it is necessary to see that the cotton used for the chest is made of soft cotton
 bahut patala, yaa kathor antha hua soot palak ko haani pahunchaa saktaa he
 The untrained bird is taught to sit on the arm blindfolded and then the raw flesh is rubbed on its beak and clutches
 sheeghra hi chidiya maance par chonch maarane lagati he or use khaanaa shuru kar detii he
 If not, then tie the knot above the joint of its leg, sitting the bird in the middle of the bed
 isse vah ksht anubhav karti he or gaanth par chonch maarane lagati he
 Now by placing a few pieces of raw meat near the knot, the bird starts bending and eating meat
 jab chidiya maans khaane lage, tab bandhan ko dhire dhire kaat dete hai
 After a few days, the bird waits for the feeding time
 aise samay aankh ko dhire dhire khol dete hai
 Now she starts eating without any interruption
 uparyukt prashikshan main aath din, yaa isse adhik, samay lag saktaa he
 It should be remembered that at the time of sitting on the wrist, the glove must remain in the hand, especially in the beginning
 nai shikari chidiya manushya ke nikat aane par swabhaavat: dar jaati he
 It is necessary to remove the fear of it first
 iske liye yah dekhnaa chahie ki fadafdane se chidiya ke pankh tooten nahin or chidiya ke pankh ko punch par dumra yaa "gaddi' se baandhakar, use manushyon yaa halle gulle ke paas rakhte hai, athwa chidiya ko raat main kai ghante bina chamade kii topi pahanaae rakhte hai or phir kramash: raat main topi ko kabhi kabhi pahanaate or nikaal lete hai
 The proper method of using the dumra is that by wearing a thread on the root of the forehead of the tail of the bird's tail, tie the thread on the tail and wrap it around the tail with a piece of cloth
 is gaddi yaa jacket ko kai din tak pahanaakar rakhaa jaataa he
 The cushion is not removed for the first two days
 peeche keval raat main nikaal diya jaataa he
 Such an eagle tied in a cushion is tied in the middle of the bed and its eyelid is kept open
 aisi charpai bheedwale janamaarg par rakh di jaati he
 In this type of behavior, eagles become dogs, dogs, trains etc
 raat main use haath par baitaakar ghumaya jaataa he
 Such behavior is, in particular, treated with rosemary sparrows
 jab pakshi paryaapt paaltu bana liya jaataa he or bina dar ke khaane pine lagata he, tab kuch duuri se kachche maance kaa tukdaa dikhalaakar, pakshi ko haath par bulaayaa jaataa he
 This action is repeated several times and the distance is gradually increased
 shikaar ko pakadakar paalak ke paas laane kii bhi shiksha di jaati he
 The value of the bird depends on the type, training and utility of the bird

 Although now steam-powered trains and other machines have faded, almost half of the world's electric power is still being generated with the help of steam turbines
 bhaap ingine banane ke ytn kaa sabase pracheen ullekh alexandria ke hero ke lekhon main miltaa he
 Hero was a member of the famous Alexandrian sect schwör bei koran which included masters of erstwhile sciences such as Ptolemy, Euclid, Eratosthenes
 hero ne apane lekh main ek aisi yukti kaa varnan kiya he jisamen ek band baks main vaayu garm kii jaati thi or ek nalee ke maarg se neeche pani bhare bartan kii ore failati thi
 The water of the vessel used to flow into the second tube and it became a fake shower
 phir iske baad is sambandh main kahin koi vivaran nahin miltaa he
 In 1606 AD, some 2,000 years from Hero, Marquesave della Porta, founder of Napoleon's Academy and then a pioneer of science in Europe, used steam instead of air in Hero's sprinkling experiment
 unhone yah bhi sujhaayaa ki kisi bartan ko pani se bharne ke liye yadi use ek nalee dwaara pani se kisi talab se sambandhit kar diya jaay or tab us bartan main bhaap bharkar phir use upar se pani ke dwaara thanda kiya jaay to bheetar kii bhaap sanghanit hokar nirvaat utpann karegi or uski jagah talab se pani bartan main bhar jayega
 In 1698, this suggestion of Marquesve della Porta was used by Thomas Savory in a water dispenser
 is prakaar severy pehla vyakti tha jisane vyavsaayik upyog kaa ek bhaap ingine banaaya, jiskaa upyog khadaanon main se pani ulichane or kuon main se pani nikaalane main hua
 The next stage of the steam engine was the invention of the Neocomain engine after the invention of the engine of Savory

 The important work of James Watt is to give the best form of steam engine, which increased the power of human beings ten times and made a huge change in the commercial field
 james wat glassgo main ek chatur vaigyanik yantrarachayita the or 1763 main glassgo vishvavidhyalay ke bhautikee ke professor se unhen ek newkamen ingine kii marammat kaa odash mila jo kabhi thik na chalata tha
 By repairing it, Watts noticed that the fuel wasted badly
 vichaarsheel swabhaav ke wat ne isse shreshth mashin banane kaa vichaar prarambh kar diya
 In this way, he made many discoveries and instruments, from which the steam engine got its present form and became a powerful instrument in the progress of industry and civilization
 bhaap ingine ke nimnlikhit mukhya prakaar hai : In a single-engine engine, the steam acts on one side of the piston and in the two-way engine the steam works on both sides of the piston
 yadi in donon prakaar ke injanon main anya sabhi avasthaaen samaan hon, to dvikriya ingine dwaara praapt shakti duusare prakaar ke ingine dwaara praapt shakti kii dooni hoti he
 This is the reason that an action engine is rarely used these days
 silinder kii dhuree ke urdhwadhar yaa kshaitij hone ke anusaar ingine urdhwadhar yaa kshaitij kaha jaataa he
 The horizontal engine occupies more space than the vertical engine
 urdhwadhar prakaar ke ingine main gharshan aadi kam hota he, jiske kaaran yah kshaitij ingine kii tulana main adhik din tak chal saktaa he
 The speed of a steam engine is in fact its crank shaft rotation per minute
 chaar foot piston stroke evam 80 parikraman prati mintewale ingine main ausat piston chaal 640 foot prati minute hogi
 This engine will be called the low speed engine
 saadhaarant: 100 parikraman prati minute kii chaal se kam chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko nimna chaal ingine kehete hai evam 250 parikraman prati minute kii chaal se adhik chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko ucch chaal ingine kehete hai
 An engine running between 100 and 250 revolutions per minute is called a "medium speed engine"
 ucch chaal ingine kii sabase bada gun yah he ki samaan shakti ke liye yah bahut hi chote aakaar kaa hota he
 Steam is also less expensive due to the high speed, as heat transfer between steam and cylinder takes a very short time in this type of engine
 asanghnan ingine vah bhaap ingine he jisase bhaap kaa nikaas sidhe vayumandal main hota he evam iske liye silinder main bhaap kii daab vayumandal kii daab se kabhi kam nahin honi chahie
 After working steam in the condensing engine, it enters the condenser and converts it into water at atmospheric pressure there
 sanghnitr kaa vyavhaar karne se bhaap adhik kaary kar paati he
 In simple engines, each cylinder receives steam directly from the boiler and exhales directly into the atmosphere or condenser
 sanyoji ingine main bhaap ek silinder main, jise ucch daab silinder kehete hai, kuch had tak prasaarit hoti he or uske baad usase kuch bade silinder main, jise nimna daab silinder kehete hai, pravesh karti he evam yahan prasar kii kriya purna hoti he
 Often the low pressure cylinder exits the condenser
 prasar teen yaa chaar silinder main bhi ho saktaa he evam in injanon ko triprasar ingine yaa chatushprasar ingine kehete hai
 The heat engine has the maximum efficiency / T1 with T1 and T2 being the maximum and minimum temperatures in the heat engine cycle
 isse pataa chalata he ki ingine kii dakshata in donon tapon par nirbhar karti he
 The efficiency of the steam engine will increase as the value of it increases and the value of it decreases
 ke mulya ko badhaane ke liye byler se nikal kar ingine main aanevaali bhaap kii daab ko badhanaa hoga, kyonki bhaap kii daab jitani hi adhik hogi kaa mulya utana hi badhegaa
 There is another way to increase
 vah he bhaap ko atitapit karnaa
 The superheat of steam is increased by treating the superheat in the boiler
 ke maan ko kam karne ke liye sanghnitr kaa vyavhaar karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The condenser is converted into steam water by cold water
 at: achche sanghnitr main kaa maan thande jal ke taap ke baraabar ho saktaa he
 This suggests that the engine will be more efficient by having more pressure in the steam engine and the work done by the superheated steam and converting the steam to water at a temperature equal to the temperature of the cold water obtainable in the condenser
 boyler se bhaap ucch daab par bhapapeti main pravesh karti he
 As soon as the piston reaches the end of the stroke, at the same time the valve moves, in which the steam opens and the steam enters the cylinder
 bhaap kii daab dwaara dhakka die jane se piston aage badhata he
 This is called front stroke
 piston kii chaal dwaara crank, crank shaft evam utkendrak chalate hai
 The entrance of the fender opens the door a bit more
 silinder main bhaap tab tak pravesh karti rahati he jab tak dwaar ekadam band nahin ho jaataa
 At this time, there is a breakup and after this the steam is not stored in the cylinder
 silinder main ai hui bhaap ab prasaarit hoti he evam is prasar main bhaap kaa aaytan bad jaataa he evam daab kam ho jaati he
 Steam works at similar times
 agr stroke ke ant main valve bhapadwar ko nikaas kii ore khol detaa he, jisase bhaap nirmukt hoti he
 The pressure of the ejected steam becomes equal to the back pressure
 nirmochan hone ke kuch kshan ke baad piston peeche kii ore lautataa he evam ise prayaavartan stroke kehete hai
 The piston exhausts the remaining steam in the cylinder while returning to this stroke
 jab piston is stroke ke ant par pahunchataa he, valve nikaas dwaar ko band kar detaa he, jisase bhaap kaa pravaah band ho jaataa he
 There is some steam left between the cylinder top and the piston, which is not released
 phir chakra kii punrariti hoti he
 In this two-way engine, the action of the same chakra is on the other side of the cylinder
 rankin chakra ek saidhantik chakra he, jiske anusaar bhaap ingine kaary karata he
 The main function of the speed regulator is to regulate the speed of the engine
 bhaap ingine ke gati-niamak in do tareekon main se ek hi sahaayta se paribhraman kii gati sthir rakh paata he: The speed regulator, which regulates engine speed by increasing or decreasing the pressure of steam according to the demand of power, is called a barrier regulator
 gatiniamak ek avrodh valve ko chalaata he, jo mukhya bhaap nalee main rakhaa hota he
 In this type of gait regulator, the main motile condyle is the motile regulator
 valve santulit prakaar kaa hota he, arthath bhaapadaab dwaara parinami bal shunya hota he
 When the engine speed increases, the speed of the revolutions of the accelerating condensates also increases, which increases the centrifugal force
 bal kii yah vruddhi unhen gurutvkarshnabal evam niyantran kamaani ke viruddh baahar chalane kaa baadhya karti he
 This causes the valve to close in part
 valve dwaara avrodh hone par piston par kaary karanevaali bhaap kii daab main kami ho jaati he, jiske kaaran utpann shakti bhi kam ho jaati he
 And as the engine speed decreases, the valve spring rises and as the engine speed decreases, the valve spring rises and the pressure of the steam acting on the piston increases, which in turn increases the speed to normal speed
 But it comes
 avrodh gati-niamak dwaara niyamit bhaap ingine main prayog ke baad yadi ingine main prati ghante vyavahrut bhaap kii taul ko ashwashakti ke saath aankaa jaae, to ek saral rekha praapt hogi
 This relationship was first found by Willian
