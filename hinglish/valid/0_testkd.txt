 Human resource management is the skillful and consistent approach to managing the most valuable assets of an establishment - those working there and contributing to the achievement of business objectives individually and collectively
 "maanav sansaadhan prabandhan" or "maanav sansaadhan" shabdon kaa sthaan mukhyatah "carmik prabandhan" shabd ne le liya he, jo pratishthan main logon ke prabandhan main shaamil prakriyaaon kii vyakhya karata he
 HRM in the general sense means employing people, developing, utilizing their resources, keeping their services in line with the needs of work and reputation, and in return compensation
 isaki visheshtaon main shaamil hai: But these traditional expressions are rarely seen in theoretical normality
 kai baar karmchaaree or audyogic sambandh bhi sandehaaspad rup se samanarthak shabd ke rup main soochibaddh ho gayi hai, haalanki inhen aam taur par prabandhan or karmchaariyon ke sambandhon or karmchaariyon ke company main vyavhaar ke liye sanderbhit kiye jate hai
 The theoretical discipline is primarily based on the assumption that employees are individuals who have different goals and needs and should not be thought of as basic business resources such as trucks and filing cabinets
 is kshetra main karmchaariyon ke prati ek sakaaratmak drushtikon apanaaya jaataa he, yah maanate hue ki lagbhag sabhi karmchaaree udhyam main utpaadakta ke yogadan kii ichha rakhte hai or unke prayaason main mukhya baadha gyaan kaa abhaav, aparyaapt prashikshan or prakriya kii vifaltaaen hai
 Novice professionals working in the human resource management field are seen as a more innovative approach than the traditional approach to management
 isaki takneekein ek udhyam ke prabandhakon ko apane lakshyon ko vishistataa ke saath is prakaar vyakt karne ke liye baadhya karti hai
 It should be done in such a way that it can be understood and adopted by the employees and provide them the necessary resources for the successful execution of the assigned tasks
 is tarah HRM takneekein jab thik se lagu kii jaati hai to ve udhyam ke lakshya or samgr parichaalan kaary pranaaliyon ke prabhavi hone kii suchak hai
 In HRM too, many people play an important role in reducing risk in establishments
 carmik prabandhan jaise samanarthak shabd kaa aksar ek bahut simit arth main prayog kiya jaataa he, jo karmchaariyon kii bhartee, sadasyon ke vetan tathaa laabhon or unke kaary-jivan kii zarurat kii vyavastha uplabdh karaane jaisi gatividhiyon ke liye aavashyak he
 So if we talk about the actual definition, according to Torrington and Hall, the definition of personnel management is as follows: "aisi gatividhiyon kii ek shrinkhalaa jo: prathamtah kaam karne waalon or unke niyokta pratishthanon ke uddeshyon or kaary-sambandh kii prakruti tathaa dwitiyatah yah sunishchit karnaa ki samjhaute kaa puraa nirvaah hua he

 jabaki miller kaa suzav he ki HRM kaa sambandh: " xxrep 7 
 is the decisions and actions that concern the management of employees at all levels in the business related to the implementation of skillful policies implementation strategy towards creating competitive advantage
 "
 The goal of human resource management is to attract employees to an establishment, retain them, and help them effectively meet their skill management goals
 yahaan upyukt shabd shaayad "niyojan" he, udaa
 ek HRM ke drushtikon kii talash kisi pratishthan ke karmchaariyon ke prabandhan or company kii samgr kootnithik disha ke bich niyojan sunishchit karnaa he
 
 HRM ke shaikshanik siddhant kaa mul aadhaar yah he ki manushya mashin nahin he isliye hamen kaarysthal par logon ke aatanrik anushaasan kii jaanch kii aavashyaktaa he
 Areas such as psychology, industrial engineering, industrial, judicial / epistemological studies and institutional psychology, industrial relations, sociology and critical theory: postmodernism, post-structuralism play a major role
 kai collejon or vishvavidhyalayon ne maanav sansaadhan prabandhan main snaatak or para-snaatak kii digriyon ke paathyakram rakhe hai
 The plan to use hrm's role extensively has been developed by Dave Elrich, which defined HRM functions in 4 areas: haalanki, prashasan or karmchaaree himachati kii bhoomika se pare kai or maanav sansaadhan kaary in dinon sangharsh kar rahe hai or karmchaaree himachati ko sheersh prabandhan ke liye ranneetik rup se pratikriyasheel nahin balki sakriy bhagidaar ke rup main dekha gaya he
 In addition, the HR establishment also has trouble proving how the company benefits from their activities and processes
 keval haal ke varshon main hi HR vidwaanon or HR peshewaron ne vah model viksit karne par dhyaan kendrit kiya he jo yah nirdhaarit kar saktaa he ki HR se phayda hota he
 Human resource management is involved in many processes
 saath hi unase uparyukt lakshya ko praapt karne kii apeksha kii jaati he
 These processes can be implemented by an HR department, but some tasks can also be done outsourced or by line-managers or other departments
 jab prabhavi dhang se ekikrut hote hai to ve company ko mahatvapurn aarthik laabh pradaan karte hai
 There are different types of careers available in HRM
 HRM main anek vishyon kii jaankaree se sambaddh naukariyaan hai jaise maanav sansaadhan sahaayak kii
 There are careers associated with employment, recruitment and placement, which are usually conducted by interviewers, EEO experts or college employers

 maanav sansaadhan prabandhan ke kaaryon main vibhinn gatividhiyaan, jinamein mukhya rup se yah mahatvapurn faisla he ki aapako kitne staff kii jarurat he or kya un aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye swatantra thekedaaron yaa bhaade par karmchaariyon kii seva lene kii jarurat he, bhartee or behtareen karmchaaree prashikshan, ucch kaary pradarshan ko sunishchit karnaa, pradarshan ke muddon se nipatna or apane karmchaariyon or prabandhan ke tareekon ko niyamon ke anuroop sunishchit karnaa shaamil hai
 Activities also include managing employee interest and compensation, your access to employee records and personnel policies
 aam taur par chote vyavsaayon ko yah gatividhiyaan swayan kerani padati hai kyonki ve philhal purnakalik yaa alp-kaalik sahaayta kaa kharch vahan nahin kar pate
 haalanki unhen hameshaa yah sunishchit hona chahie ki karmchaaree maujuuda niyamon ke anuroop carmik nitiyon ke prati jaagruk rahete the-or rahete hai
 These policies often remain in the form of employee manuals that all employees have
 yah dhyaan dene yogya he ki kuch log HRM or HRD ke bich antar dekhte hai
 Such people include HRM in HRD, saying that HRD includes a wide range of activities within the establishment, such as career development, training, development of the establishment, etc
 ek lambe samay se yah tark diya jaataa rahaa he ki HR ke kaary bade pratishthanon main sanyojit kiye jane chahie, udaa
"pratishthan vikaas vibhaag main HR rahanaa chahie yaa uske aas-paas koi doosraa rasta hona chahie?" HRM activities and HRD profession have undergone tremendous changes in the last 20-30 years
 kai saal pehle bade pratishthanon main "carmik vibhaag" zyaadaatar logon ko kaam par rakhane or bhugtan karne se sambandhit kagaji karrwai ke prabandhan kaa kaam dekhte the
 More recently, establishments have considered the key role of an "HR department" that helps employees in hiring, training and managing people to enable the organization to perform tasks with maximum efficiency in a high way
 kisi upkram ke lakshyon ko praapt karne tathaa uske kaary ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye upyukt evam yogya karmchaariyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Such employees can be obtained only if they are selected scientifically
 ‘bhartee’ bhavi karmchaariyon ko khojane tathaa unhen sanghathan main rikt sthanon ke liye aavedan karne ke liye prerit karne kii prakriya he
 "recruitment of employees is the function of the Department of Secondary Management

 Recruitment of employees should be done under a planned policy
 bhartee kii prakriya kaa armbh karmchaariyon kii maang nirdhaaran se armbh hota he
 In large industries where many tasks are done, the requirement of the employees should be prepared by the supervisor according to the department, because he is well aware of the production capacity of the employees, and is able to determine the required labor accordingly
 
 anek baar use vyavsaay ke kii sahaayta bhi leni padati he
 The desired number of labor should be clear and sure
 is prakaar vibhinn kaaryon ke liye pruthak-pruthak maang patr taiyaar kiye jate hai
 The problem of recruitment of workers was not complicated when the industries were not much developed
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke samay tathaa uske uparant jab teevrgati se audyogikaran armbh hua tab anek bhartee kii pranaaliyon kaa vikaas hua tathaa bhartee ke kai nai strot dhude gayi
 Earlier, only intermediaries were used to recruit workers
 kintu ab kai vidhiyon jaise niyojan karyaalay, vigyaapan, kshetreey yatra, vyavsaayik metigen, vishisht khoj, vibhinn strot tathaa company ke bheetar hi upyukt vyakti kii khoj aadi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 It is necessary that secular management should be in close contact with these sources
 ek acchhee prabandhkeey niti vah he jisamen karyrat karmchaaree ko praathamikta di jaati he arthath antirik strot kaa yathasambhav pehle upyog kiya jaataa he
 If the person is not received from internal source, then source should be used outside, employment office, advertisement in newspapers etc
 bhartee se purv bhartee ke uddeshy nishchit kar liye jane chahie tathaa uddeshyon ke anuroop bhartee kii niti nirdhaarit kii jaani chahie
 More success can be achieved if these pre-determined policies are implemented by specific methods
 nishpaksh bhartee niti main nimna tathyon kaa samavesh hona chahie- In general, the recruitment policy should pay adequate attention to the number of employees and their qualities
 bharat main sarkari pratishthanon main bhartee prabandhakon dwaara hi kii jaati he
 It has been recognized that there should be no government intervention at all
 san 1955 main bhartiya sansad ne sarkari pratishthanon main bhartee hetu ek audyogic seva ayog ke bare main sukshav diya tha ki jisase kaary-pranali main adhik dakshata laayi ja sake
 The question of running these establishments more efficiently was also considered by the Estimates Committee
 sarkari pratishthanon main vibhinn padon ke liye alag-alag pranaaliyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The manager obtains the list from national registers and planning offices for the recruitment of technical staff and gets the advertisement published in newspapers
 kai baar kendriya athwa rajya sarkaar tathaa nijee pratishthanon se bhi upyukt vyakti sujhane hetu aagrah kiya jaataa he
 For these posts, the candidates have to take a written examination or interview
 saarvajanik upakramon main bhartee / niyojan hetu nimna nitiyaan sujhai gayi hai : - The selection process consists of the following steps: yadi chayan-prakriya ke antargat abhyarthiyon ko kaam karne par bal dena he to praarambhik saakshaatkaar kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Such an interview will be very brief and its main purpose is to find out the obvious defects and ineligibility of the candidates and cancel them
 bolte samay haklaana, chalate samay langadaana, haath yaa pair kaa tutaa hona, aankhon main dosha hona aadi dosha kaa pataa lagane ke liye kisi visheshgy kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Secondly, in this type of interview, information is obtained about the salary, educational qualification and experience required by the candidates
 keval unheen abhyarthiyon ko chayan ke prakriya main aage badhane kaa avasar pradaan kiya janaa chahie jinke chayan kii kuch sambhaavnaayen hon
 Some big companies print different types of applications for different categories of posts, such as by the applicant in different types of applications for vacancies in purchasing department, sales department, factory department, office etc
 In different types of application forms to be filled, the space for the following information to be filled by the applicant remains vacant- aavedan-patr praapt karne ke baad unki jaanch kii jaati he jin abhyarthiyon main nunatam apekshit yogyata se kam yogyata ho unhen asweekaar kar diya jaataa he
 Psychological testing is a systematic program that compares the behavior of two or more individuals
 bloom ke matanusaar manovaigyanik pareekshan vyakti ke vyavhaar nishpaadan evam abhiruchi ke paksh kaa ek namoona he
 It is a methodical program through which a sample of an individual's behavior is obtained
 saakshaatkaar se pehle kabhi-kabhi vyavsaayik parikshaayen lenaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 So that the technical and theoretical capacity of the applicants can be estimated
 pramukh pareekshan ye hai- All these exams can be categorized as 'mental exams'
 maansik parikshaayen le lene ke baad karmchaariyon kii vyavsaayik parikshaayen lee jaani chahie
 The most widely used tool in any selection process is 'interview'
 bina iske chayan prakriya ko purna nahin samajha jaataa he
 The higher the post in the management chain, the importance of interview in the selection process also increases according to the gravity of the post
 saakshaatkaar kaa arth vaartalap athwa unase paraspar moulik kriya se he jo saamanytah do vyaktiyon ke bich kisi vishesh uddeshy se kii jaati he
 Through this, an attempt is made to get information about the person's shape, behavioral skills, emotional stability, nature, motivation and interest etc
 ’’ The objectives of the interview are three: - saakshaatkaar kaa praathmik uddeshy kaary ke liye praarthi kii or praarthi ke liye kaary kii upyuktata kaa pataa lagaana he
 Interviewing is an art and successful interviews follow some established or valid principles for comparison between a person's abilities and work requirements
 saakshaatkaar ke pramukh baaten ye hai- The main purpose of this type of interview is to initial screening or sorting the applicants 
 is vidhi se ayogy abhyarthiyon kaa nirasan karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he jisase ki shesh aavedan-patron kii jaanch gaharaai se kii ja sake evam saakshaatkaar ke samay anaavashyak samay nasht na ho
 This type of interview is completed in more than five minutes
 isamen adhik kushal saakshatkaariyon kii aavashyaktaa nahi hoti
 The drawback of this method is that sometimes qualified applicants are canceled because this interview is done in a hurry and the interviewees are not very skilled
 yadi uddeshy spasht rup se ayogy aavedankartao kii chantni kerani hi he, to acha yah hoga ki praarambhik saakshaatkaar ke sthaan par sabase pehle to aavedan-patron kii jaanch kii jaye or phir yadi aavashyak he ki unki ek sankshipt-likhit pariksha le lee jaay 
 This should be done in the same condition when the number of applicants is much higher than the available work
 ‘‘is prakaar ke anveshan main saamanytah nimna baton ke sambandh main jaankaree praapt kii jaati he- The next step in the selection process is to send the applicant to the doctor of the institution for detailed physical examination
 is pariksha kaa uddesh ya vyakti ke un shaareerik gunon ko prakat karnaa he jo ki vichaaradhin krity ke kushal nishpaadan kii drushti se mahatvapurn hote hai
 In this case, it will be possible to put the applicant on an inquiry which he can do well and get promotions in future
 saakshaatkaar evam pareekshanon ke aadhaar par praarthi kii niyukti karne athwa na karne ke vishay main nirnay liya jaataa he
 But before giving appointment letter, it is checked with the help of references provided by him
 chayankarta sandarbh ke jitne adhik nikat pahunchakar praarthi ke vishay main jaankaree praapt karegaa, jaankaree kii pramanikta evam vishwasaneeyata utani hi adhik hogi
 In case of receiving favorable reference, the applicant may be given a letter of appointment
 chayan prakriya dwaara jab praarthi kaa antim rup se chayan kar liya jaataa he or use niyukti-patr bhi de diya jaataa he, to aagaamee charan aata he ‘‘kaary par niyukti’’
 Applying any employee to the right act is as important as choosing it
 karmchaaree kii yathavidhi kaary par niyukti hone se karmchaaree kaa nishpaadan badhata he evam anupasthiti, durghatana dasha aadi main kami aati he
 Not only this, the morale and work capacity of the employee increases
 ‘ry par niyukti se aashay he chayan kiye gayi praarthi ko saunpe jane vaale krity kaa nirdhaaran tathaa us krity kaa praarthi ko saunpna
 After selection, the applicant is usually appointed on probation for six months or one year

 If the work is not satisfactory during this period, the employee can also be removed from work
 ’’ After appointment on the job, the newly appointed employee is required to come or introduce him to the establishment, work and colleagues

 The following topics are usually provided to the employee through 'introductory Program' iske uparant samay samay par yah dekhte rahanaa bhi aavashyak he ki jis uddeshy se karmchaaree kii niyukti kii gai thi vah puraa ho rahaa he athwa nahin
 It is called "advent" in the language of management
 ’’ Workers in the industry did not like to work more from the early stage of the 20th century until attaining independence because they were more interested in rural life
 gaanv chhodana shramikon ko pasand nahin tha
 However, the situation changed with the increase in the burden of population on agriculture and the development of industrialization
 gramin kshetron main kaam kii kami hone lagi tathaa udyogon kii ore shramikon ko aakarshith karne ke liye madhyasthon kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 The method of recruitment by middlemen is prevalent even today in both organized and unorganized industries
 in madhyasthon ko desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main alag-alag naamon se pukaara jaataa he, jaise- jaanbar, sardaar choudhary, mukaddam, forman, mistre, kangaani aadi
 In large factories, there are women examinations which are called Naikin or Mukdamin
 shramikon ko niyukt karnaa, nikaalnaa va rakhaana padonnati karnaa, chuttee dilaanaa, aadi inhi madhyasthon kaa kaam hota he
 The Wwaitley Commission has also written that employees were appointed from nearby villages
 keval kushal shramikon ko hi baahar se praapt kiya jaataa tha
 But after independence, there were many changes in the system of recruitment of workers
 shramikon kii pravasi pravriti main badlaav aayaa he tathaa unki gatishiltaa bhi badi he
 They now prefer to live in cities than in villages

 As a result, in India, many new sources of recruitment are used to obtain qualified employees in both private and social sectors
 rashtiy shram ayog ne saarvajanik kshetra ke udyogon kii shram samasyaon ke adhyayan ke dauraan apane prativedan main sarvocch adhikariyon se lekar nimnasth karmchaariyon tak kii niyukti ke vishay main vartmaan paristhiti par prakaash daalaa he
 According to the commission, a panel is prepared to appoint high officials

 pro0 rudrabasavraj ke adhyayan se yah bhi vidit hota he ki saarvajanik kshetra main bhartee ke jin sroton kaa upyog kiya gaya unki praathamikta kaa kram niyamanusaar hai- From the above study, information about the means of recruitment used in the public sector as well as the private sector has been obtained
 vah is prakaar hai- While forecasting the manpower requirements by the small and big industries of the private sector, the demand for labor, technical changes, government policies, etc
 are taken into consideration
 It is true that the systems used by most organizations are unproven
 keval tata, bidla, daalamia, baghad, di0si0em0 aadi jaise bade-bade sanghathanon main purnataya vaigyanik evam vivekpurna chayan paddatiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Manpower is planned by these organizations, budget is prepared, full contact with recruitment sources is made, and employees are selected by standardized selection methods

 Education and preservation are the basic mantra of a good management system
 yadi karmchaariyon se kaary or adhik utpaadan, praapt karnaa chaahate he to anke dwaara banaayi gai vastuon kii kism acchhee rakhana he to shiksha evam prashikshan atyant aavashyak he
 Through this, the employee not only acquires knowledge about the work but also generates interest in the work

 There is a difference between education and training
 shiksha kaa sambandh sampoorn vaataavaran evam paristhitiyon ke gyaan evam jaankaree se hota he
 Thus, education is aimed at the general development of the individual, whereas training is intentional education which aims at the attainment of a specific type of knowledge
 It is also true that it is difficult to move towards specific training without general education
 shiksha yathochit bodh kaa saamaanya aadhaar or prashikshan karyanvayan kaa vishisht kaushal mana ja saktaa he jo donon hi karmchaaree kii yogyata, kaaryakshmata evam nipunata ke liye aavashyak he ‘‘vastav main shiksha evam prashikshan kii aavashyaktaa ke teen mukhya aadhaar he- Through training, employee dissatisfaction can be overcome, absenteeism rate can be reduced, personal development of employees can be done in the right direction

 "in favor of the need for education and training, the following components are worth remembering - vartmaan yug main kaarkaane main kaam karne vaale shramikon ke swasthya, suraksha evam kalyaan kii aavashyaktaa teevr rup se anubhav kii gai he
 By protecting the health of workers, their efficiency can be increased and more production can be expected from them

 Sultan Ali Khan was a medium-age ex-wrestler, who lived in a small town in Haryana
 akaash oberoi ek "pro tech-down" lig kaa maalik rahata he
 He wants to hire an Indian wrestler to make it very famous
 iske liye vah sultan se baat karata he, lekin sultan saaf saaf manaa kar detaa he
 Akash now talks to his friend Govind to find out the reason for leaving his wrestling
 iske baad govind use aath saal pehle kii kahani bataata he, jab sultan ko arafa se pyaar ho jaataa he
 But Arfa refuses him
 sultan iske baad kai maheene tak bahut mehnat karata he or pahalwani ke ek muqaabale main hissaa letaa he
 Arfa and she get married soon after this competition wins and he becomes a national level wrestler
 kuch samay baad arafa maan banane vaali hoti he or pahalwani chhod detii he
 On the day his baby is about to be born, he goes to another competition and when he comes back, he learns that his child has died due to lack of blood
 uskaa khun o+ hota he, jo sultan kaa bhi hota he
 But due to his absence no other blood donor is found
 is kaaran arafa use hi us bachche ke marane kaa kaaran sochati he
 After this, the Sultan starts depositing money to build a blood bank there alone
 is baat kaa pataa chalate hi akaash sultan ko bolta he ki yadi vah lig main hissaa le letaa he to use uskaa sapana puraa karne ke liye puure paise mil jaayenge
 The Sultan agrees and moves to Delhi with him
 lekin tab tak uskaa sharir besanga or motaa rahata he
 For this reason, he leaves her to Fateh Singh, where he practices for a few weeks
 puri tarah sehatmand hone ke baad pehle hi muqaabale main sultan jeet jaataa he
 But in the semi-finals, he gets hurt very badly and gets hospitalized
 doctor akaash ko kehete hai ki jab tak vah puri tarah thik nahin ho jaataa, use ladaai nahin kerani chahie
 After this Arfa comes to the hospital and asks him to complete this work
 sultan dard ke baad bhi is pratiyogita ko jeet jaataa he or sultan or arafa phir se ek ho jate hai
 The Sultan then builds a blood bank with his prize money
 iske kuch varshon ke baad arafa ek bacchee ko janm detii he

 In Iran, 30 April is celebrated as the National Day of the Persian Gulf
 is din puure iran main vibhinn prakaar ke kaaryakramon kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 The Persian Gulf is an extension of the Indian Ocean in the Middle East Asia region, extending between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula
 30 april 1622 ko shah abbaas kii sena hurmuz bandargah main portugaliyon ko parajeet karne main safal hui
 Iran's non-governmental organizations decided to celebrate 30 April in 2004 as "national Day of the Persian Gulf"
 iran kii sarkaar ne bhi is prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya
 In fact two important incidents took place on 30 April
 ek to desh se portugali upniveshkwaad kaa nishkasana hua or duusare yah ki is din yah nirnay liya gaya ki faras kii khadi ke aitihaasik tathaa pracheen naam ko dekhte hue har saal 30 april kaa din “faras kii khadi kaa rashtriya diwas” ke taur par manaaya jaae
 This name and word has been a government and international name in all languages of the world from 2400 years ago to 1964
 kintu arab deshon ne 1964 main gupt taur par nirnay liya ki faras kii khadi kaa naam badal kar arab kii khadi rakh diya jaae
 The Iranian people see this decision as a model of Arab discrimination and communalism
 un kaa maananaa he ki jamaal abdul nasir ke daur tak kisi arabi dastauez yaa patr main arab kii khadi shabd kaa prayog nahin kiya gaya he or arab duniya kii saanskrithik dharohar kahi jane vaali samast mahatvapurn pustakon main “faras sagar’’ yaa “faras kii khadi’’ jaise shabd hi paae jate hai
 That is why Iranians have named this day as the "national Day of the Persian Gulf" to prevent efforts to change this historical and ancient name
 iraniyon kaa kahana he ki yadi sagaron ke naam hi badale jane hai to phir arab sagar kaa naam badal kar makraan sagar kiya janaa chahie kyonki is ke chaaron ore lagbhag sau karod se adhik gair arab log aabaad hai or is naam kaa upyog bhi portugali upniveshwaad ke daur main hi shuru hua tha

 unka pratham upanyaas ‘mopalon kaa vidroh’ athwa ‘mujhe isse kya ?’ tha
 'what should i do with this?' After the title novel, Savarkar wrote an excerpt of his autobiography as 'my life imprisonment'
 is aatmakathy main mukhya rup se un rajbandiyon ke jivan kaa varnan kiya gaya he jo andaman athwa ‘kaale pani’ main sashram karawas kaa bhayanak dand bhugat rahe the
 In this autobiography, the life-sketches of some murderers, robbers, bandits and cruel, selfish addicts have been etched
 iske atirikt isamen do aise prakaran hai jinamein in vishyon kii charchaa kii gai he ki hamaari rashtbhasha sanskritnishtha hindi ho tathaa ahinduon kaa hindukaran karnaa aavashyak he
 My life imprisonment also includes the concept of 'balishthar bhar Hindu Rajya-a pearl of dew'
 is pustak kaa gujarati bhashaa main anuwaad hone ke uparaant kuch british prashaskon ne ‘meraa aaajeevan karawas’ sheershak pustak par taarikh 17 april 1934 ko pratiband lagaaya
 In spite of continuing the effort to lift this ban, it remained intact
 tathaapi yah darshane ke uddeshy se ki andaman ke bandigrih main kis tarah kshtprad, taapadaayi, ammanushik evam utpaati jeevanyaapan karnaa anivaary hota he, saavarkar ne ‘kaala pani’ sheershak upanyaas likhaa
 From August 1936 'manohar' was published in the magazine
 ‘kaala pani’ upanyaas kii katha-vastu kalpit athwa mangadhat nahin he
 That is based on the indictment of a punished by the court
 vir saavarkar kii tippaniyon main is tarah kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Although the names of Rafiuddin, Yogananda, Malti etc
 are fictitious, they resemble the original names of the alleged accused
 bich main vikhyath gayak tathaa chitrapat nirmaataa shri sudhir fadake is upanyaas par chitrapat taiyaar karnaa chaahate the, parantu niyantrak mandal ne anurodh kiya ki usamen rafiuddin naamak jo muslim paatr he, usamen parivartan kiya jaay
 According to him, when the permission of Namantar was demanded from Veer Savarkar, he said in clear and concrete words, "I shall never allow such conversion, that is, to remove the Muslim name and include the Hindu name
" yah dikhaava ki kuch muslim shisht, sadhu vritti ke hote he, parantu muslim naam main parivartan karne ke liye main anumati nahin doongaa
 '' prastut upanyaas main ek aise swatantraaa senaanee kaa charitra varnan he, jise san 1857 ke swatantraa sangram main dand mila tha
 The fighter, who has been liberated after suffering punishment, remains the resident of Andaman
 yah yoddha kapolkalpit nahin he
 When Savarkar was in Andaman, there were two or three such warriors in that period, who would be around eighty-eighty-five
 is aayu main bhi ve pake paan udhar hi rahete the tathaa unhone saavarkar se gupt sanrpak kiya tha
 He had a sixty-knot with Savarkar
 is upanyaas kii kuch samikshaon kii saavarkar ne tippaniyan rakhi hai
 He has also looked at which sentences have been removed by 'manohar' magazine
 ho saktaa he, us kaal main aise do-teen vaakya ashleel prathit hone ke kaaran unhen nikaal diya gaya ho
 Kamya or Rustic vulgarity is rare in Savarkar's literature, however, in the controversy which took place in the giants like Acharya Atre and Prof
 Phadke
 Phadke had said that Acharya always criticizes Phadke's literature, saying that it depicts obscene, gruesome episodes, but in the literature of Savarkar, he never criticizes, nor does he make any fuss
 Huh
 pro fadake ke is kathan kaa spashtikaran karte hue acharya atre kehete hai, ‘‘fadake-varnit balaatkaar ke prasang padhate samay pathak ke man main yah abhilaashaa utpann hoti he ki vah bhi usee tarah kisi par balaatkaar kare
 But while reading the context of the Savarkar-narrated rape, blood starts to boil with anger, and a fervent desire arises that the paltry sinner, pouring a hundred lashes at Chandal, blows his skin, punishing him harshly
 ’’ is upanyaas ke silsile main ek pathak shri vachasundar sonmoh, ta
 katol ne saavarkar ke likhe patr main kaha he-‘‘meri yah dharna thi ki aapkaa sahitya neeras hota he
 Many more such papers and opinions have been published from time to time

 vadhvani foundation ramesh vadhvani dwaara sthapit ek parmarthik sanghathan he
 The aim of this organization is to accelerate the economic progress of India and other emerging economies
 khesar main bharat ke bihar rajya ke antargat magadh mandal ke aurangabad jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Chainpur is a village in Araria under Purnia division of Bihar state of India in Araria
 carch shabd unani visheshan kaa apbhransh he jiskaa shabdic arth he "prabhu kaa"
 In fact, the Church is used in two ways; One is the building of the Lord that is the Church and the other is the organization of Christians
 carch ke atirikt 'kalisia' shabd bhi chalata he
 It is a distorted form of the word 'ecclesia' in the Greek Bible; In the Bible it means - a local or community of Christians around the world
 baad main yah shabd girjaghar ke liye bhi prayukt hone laga
 Here the church will be considered in the sense of institution
 sabhi isai praaia: is baat se sahamat hai ki isa ne keval ek hi carch kii sthapana kii thi, kintu anek kaarnon se isaayiyon kii ekta akshunn nahin rah saki
 As a result, many of their churches or organizations exist today, which are completely independent of each other
 unka vargeekaran is prakaar kiya ja saktaa he : In the early centuries of Christianity, little has been done about the definition and form of the Church
 bible main isa kii jeevani tathaa shiksha kaa jo varnan he usase spasht he ki prarambh hi se isaayiyon kaa vishwaas tha ki is ne samast maanav jati ke liye mukti ke sadhano ko sulabh kar diya or is uddeshy se prithvi par "ishwar kaa rajya" sthapit kiya
 The "kingdom of God" is a community of people who believe in the divinity of Jesus and receive his teachings
 bible main us samudaay ko "ishwar ko praja" kaha gaya he
 For his organization and rule, Jesus selected 12 disciples and gave them special teaching and authority and ordered them to go around the world to preach their teachings and baptize believers into the church
 is prakaar bible main isa ke anuyaayiyon ke samudaay ko carch, "ishwar kaa rajya" tathaa "ishwar kii praja" kaha gaya he
 From these positions it may appear that initially the actual form of the church has been considered limited to external organization, but this is not the case
 isa ne apni shiksha main isapar bal diya he ki unamem tathaa unke sachche anuyaayiyon main adrishy evam rahasyatmak ekta he
 He said to his disciples- "I take the vine and you are the branches
" " isse spasht ho jaataa he ki carch kaa sabase mahatvapurn tatv aadhyatmik hi he
 Saint Paul has laid great emphasis on this spiritual and mystic aspect of the church
 isa tathaa unke sachche anuyaayiyon kaa aadhyatmik sambandh or isa ke sabhi anuyaayiyon kii rahasyamay ekta ko spasht karne ke liye unhone apane patron main barambar carch ko "isa kaa aadhyatmik sharir" kaha he 
 Hence, from the beginning both the external organization of the church and its spiritual form have been taken care of
 protestant dharm ke kaaran carch main foot padi to dharmacharya carch ke swaroop par adhik chintan karne lage
 Protestant scholars put more emphasis on the invisible form of the church and in response to the Catholic Church's outward organization of the church, its visible membership, etc
 is vivaad main unhone carch ke chaar bahari lakshanon kaa apekshaakrit adhik mahatv diya he
 The true Church of Christ is Catholic; One is, in the bondage of love, all its members believe in the principles of religion
 ek sanskaar, ek si pujanapaddati or ek hi parmadhikari kaa shashan sweekaar karte hai; pavitra he ; apozels he The visible organization of the church may also include some people who are hypocrites who have no spiritual connection with Jesus, who are not part of Jesus' spiritual body
 ishwar hi jaanata he ki koun carch kaa sachcha sadsy he or is kaaran yah mana ja saktaa he ki vaastavik carch adrishy hi he
 Even then, the sacraments are the essential condition of full membership of that invisible real church, so cannot be separated from the invisible church
 aajkal praaia: sabhi protetianst bhi is baat ko maanate hai
 Even though full membership of the Church is required for salvation, it is not compulsory
 ishwar sabhi logon kii mukti chahta he or sab manushyon ke ant:karan main satprerana utpann karata he
 Those who follow the inspiration of God inadvertently become imperfect members of the Church invisibly and can achieve salvation provided by Jesus
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke pashchaat isai sansar main carch kii ekta ke andolan ko adhik mahatv diya jane laga
 Consequently, in an effort to determine the true form of the church based on the elements existing in the Bible, excluding rebuttal, the emphasis is on the fact that the church is the spiritual body of Jesus
 isa uskaa sheersh he or sachche isai us sharir ke ang hai

 After the death of Jesus, his disciples started preaching Christianity among Jews and non-jews
 pratham mishnariyon main se sabase safal the sant paulus; unki yatraaon kaa varnan tathaa unke patr bibil ke uttarardh main surakshit hai
 At that time Antioch was the third city of the Roman Empire, Saint Peter, the successor of Christ, came here and from that center Saint Paul preached Christianity in Asia Minor, Macedonia and Greece
 baad main rajdhani rome isai dharm kaa pradhan centre bana
 At the same time, Saint Peter and Saint Paul were martyred
 bible kaa uttarardh pratham shatabdi i
 ke uttarardh main likhaa gaya
 By 100 AD, Christian communities existed in all the adjacent countries and cities of the Mediterranean Sea, especially in Asia Minor and North Africa
 teesri shatabdi ke ant tak isai dharm vishaal roman samrajya ke sabhi nagaron main fail gaya tha; isi samay faras tathaa dakshin rus main bhi bahut se log isai ban gaye
 There are many reasons for this success
 ek to us samay logon main prabal dharmajigyaasa thi, duusare isai dharm prayek maanav kaa mahatv sikhalaataa tha, chaahe vah das athwa stri hi kyon na ho
 Apart from this, people could not live without being influenced by the spirit of Christianity
 2
 pratham teen shatabdiyon ke itihaas kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki samay par shaskaon dwaara isaayiyon par atyaachaar kiya gaya or ve badi sankhya main apana dharm chhod dene kii apeksha sanand yantranaa evam mrityu sweekaar karte the
 Although the Roman rulers viewed the new religion with skepticism from the beginning and persecuted its followers, it was only in the third century that a complete attempt was made to completely eradicate the Christian religion, especially Desius, Diocliction, In the reigns of the Muskminians and Gallerius
 3
 sanghathan is prakaar tha : har shahar main sthaneey giraje kaa parmadhikari dharmadhyaksh kehalaata tha, unke shashan main purohit or uppurohit dharm kaaryo main lage rahete the
 In Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, bishops were given the title of Petriarch, but everywhere were considered to be the exclusive authority of the Bishop of Rome
 4
 praarambhik isai sahitya pradhanthya unani bhashaa main likhaa gaya he
 Origen and Saint Irenaeus are particularly notable
 ireneyas ne tatkaaleen bhraamak dharanaon kaa virodh karte hue roman carch kii shiksha ko sachhee isai shiksha kii kasuti ghoshit kiya
 He denied much of Christian esotericism
 goongyaanavaad isa ke purv hi se chalaa aa rahaa tha kintu baad main isamen isai tatwein kaa samavesh kiya gaya tha
 The fundamental principle of that suit is that all physical world and human body is also corrupted
 kisi na kisi rup main yah siddhant shatabdiyon tak jivit rahaa
 Teratullian, a native of North Africa, is the first noted Christian writer in the Latin language
 duusari shatabdi ke ant tak edessa ke aasapaas siriyak bhashaa main isai sahitya kii rachana prarambh ho gai thi

 In the civil war that ensued for the successor after the renunciation of Dioclution, Constantine was victorious and he gave freedom to all religions by taking out the edict of Milan in 313 AD
 us samay ariyas ke mat ke kaaran isai sansar main ashaanti failane lagi thi
 To overcome this, Constantine organized the first World Assembly of the Catholic Church; This assembly of Nicaea declared in opposition to Aureus's belief that Jesus is God in real sense
 konstantin ke uttaradhikariyon ne ariyas ke anuyaayiyon kaa paksh liya, falswaroop lagbhag 50 varsh tak purvi katholic carch main itani avyavashtha rahi ki vahaan kaa carch us kuprabhav se kabhi mukt nahin ho paaya
 Towards the end of that century, the first real Christian emperor Theodosius declared Christianity as a religion; He also controlled the followers of Aureus and for that purpose organized the Second World Assembly of the Catholic Church in Küstüntunia
 paanchavin shatabdi main or do baar vishwasabha bulaai gai
 Bishop Nestorius of Kuntuntunia began to proclaim a new doctrine according to which two divine and human persons existed in Jesus
 effesus kii vishwasabha ne nestorius ko padchyut kiya or uske anuyaayiyon ko carch se bahishkrut ghoshit kiya, iske falswaroop faras kaa carch alag ho gaya
 Later Eutikas introduced monophysicism according to which Jesus has only one person and one nature
 is mat ke virodh main kalcedon kii vishwasabha ne isa main ishwartv tathaa manushyatv donon ko vaastavik mana he
 The bishops of Syria, Armenia, and Egypt rejected the decision of Caledonian and the Christian communities of those countries also parted from the Catholic Church
 baad main islam ne syria or mistra ko samrajya se chin liya or vahaan ke adhikansh log us nae dharm se sammilit hue

 In the beginning of this era, Christian literature developed in a unique way
 unani bhashaa ke lekhakon main athanasius, sant basil or unke bhai nissa ke sant gregory, najiansus ke sant gregory, kunstutuniya ke bishap sant yohan crisostemas or sikandriyaa ke sant sirilas vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai

 The main Christian writers of the Latin language in the West are: Saint Ambrosius, Bishop of Milan, Saint Augustine and Sat Jerome
 sant jerome ne samast bible kaa latin bhashaa main anuwaad kiya or unka anuwaad aaj tak roman carch kii puujaapaddati main prayukt he

 From the beginning of Christianity, some people took a vow to remain lifelong celibate, they often lived in secluded places, but they gradually began to do spiritual practice in their neighborhood according to their instructions
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki ek hi sthaan main rahanevaale saadhakon ne ek hi adhikari kaa shashan sweekaar kar liya
 The first monastery of this type was founded in Egypt in 320 CE by Saint Pacomius
 iske anukaran par philistin, syria or asia miner main badi sankhya main purushon or striyon ke mathon kii sthapana hui thi or paanchavin shatabdi main sikandriyaa, aantiok, kunstuntaniya aadi shaharon main bhi aise math sthapit ho chuke the
 The rules of Sant Basil were generally accepted in them
 pashchim main sant marthin ne pehle pahal 360 i
 main france ke dakshin main ek math sthapit kiya gaya or usee centre se france ke sabhi dehaton main isai dharm kaa prachaar hua kyonki us samay tak keval italy tathaa uttar africa kaa dehaat isai ban gaya tha
 Saint Patrick was first a monk in France, joined Ireland with his disciples in Christianity and later sanyasis preached Christianity in a large number of countries in Western Europe
 sant bennedikt ne bhi ek dharmasangh kii sthapana kii or mathvaasi jivan ke liye ek niyamavali likhi jise europe ke praaia: sabhi mathon ne sweekaar kar liya
 Saints of the Benedictine Confederacy were sent to England in the sixth century CE
 unhone vahaan kii jatiyon ko isai dharm main mila liya or apane sangh ke math bhi sthapit kiye
 Saint Beed was an English Benedictine who wrote the first history of England
 ek samakaleen angrej bennediktin sant boniphos ne pehle holland main dharmprachaar kiya or baad main germany ke adhikansh bhaag ko isai dharm main milaayaa
 The credit for this propagation of Christianity in the West is mainly to the monastic people

 paanchavin shatabdi se pashchim roman samrajya tathaa uttar africa main barbar jatiyon kaa aagaman prarambh hua tha ore us shatabdi ke ant main italy ke baahar sarvatra un barbar raajaaon kaa shashan sthapit ho chukaa tha
 Not one of them was a Catholic

 At the end of the sixth century, the Catholic Franks took control of all the present-day France
 portugal kii suavi jati bhi chhathi shatabdi ke madhya katholic dharm main sammilit ho gai or spain ke vijigoth 589 i
 main orius kaa mat tyaag kar katholic ban gaye
 The most important historical figure of Spain in the next century is Saint Isidore, who was Bishop of Seville for 36 years

 sant gregory 590 i
 main rome ke bishap chune gaye
 During his reign, the Lombard race was attacked in Italy
 samrat unka virodh karne main asamarth tha or sant gregari ne lombard netaaon se bhent kar rome kii raksha kii
 In fact he was the de facto ruler of Rome at that time
 unheen ko cotholic carch ke rajya kaa sansthaapak mana ja saktaa he
 Hazrat Muhammad was born during the lifetime of Saint Gregory; His followers captured North Africa in 695 AD and Spain in 711 AD
 yadhyapi purv main kunstutuniya kaa avrodh asafal hua tathaa pashchim main frake jati ke charles maarthel ne musalmaan senaaon ko france ke dakshin main haraa diya tha, tathaapi us samay se lekar 900 varsh tak isai tathaa musalmaan senaaon kaa sangharsh chalata rahaa
 Charles Martel's son Pepin Frank became king of the race
 kuch samay baad italy par lombard jati kaa nayaa akraman hua
 Seeing the Emperor unable, the Pope asked for Pepin's help and defeated the Lambarde race with his Frank army and gave the central part of Italy to the Pope
 us din se katholic carch kaa rajya vidhiwat prarambh hua or 1870 i
 tak bana rahaa
 10
 Pepin's son Charlemagne made a successful effort for the political, religious and cultural unity of Europe during his long reign
 unhone spain main islam kaa virodh kiya tathaa uttar main sackson jatiyon ko haraakar unako isai banane ke liye baadhya kiya
 During his lifetime, education was promoted and religious progress was made everywhere
 kintu unki mrityu ke baad unke samrajya kaa vighatan hua or samast europe main ashaanti fail gai
 It also affected the organization of the church
 us yug ko pashchim ke aadhyatmik patan kaa yug kaha gaya he
 The indiscipline among ordinary priests increased and many of them married, although from the fifth century onwards, the rule of priests remained unmarried
 bishap tathaa mathadhyaksh samant bhi the or unke chunaav main bahudhaa ghoosekhori kaa haath rahaa karata tha
 The pope was also a king and many priests were merely political to rule the papal states
 popon ke chunaav main roman saamanton kii pratiyogita bhi hone lagi tathaa raajnneetik pratidwandviyon dwaara bahut se popon kii hatya bhi kar di gai thi
 Due to this, from 886 AD to 1043 AD, 37 became Pope
 us patan ke pratikriyaswaroop 10veen shatabdi main france ke kluni math netritv main pashchim europe main mathvaasi jivan kaa apurv punarvikas hua
 Hundreds of other subcontracts accepted the discipline of the monarchy of Cluny, making the monarchy of Cluny the most important person in the Christian world after the pope
 11
 kunstutuniya ke netritv main naveen shatabdi main balkan kii slav jatiyon kaa dharmaparivartan hua or uske baad rus main bhi isai dharm kaa vishesh vistaar hua
 The biggest misfortune of Christianity is that the separation of Greek-speaking Oriental Catholics and Latin-speaking Western Catholics began to grow in that era

 The murals depicting the palaces of Bikaner Fort, Lalgarh Palace, many canopies etc
 are important from this point of view
 bikaner main kashtha-patticoon par utkrisht chithran hua
 a notable example is the marking of radha-krishna's image on the kinwar-jodi of the National Museum, New Delhi

 After Maharaja Surat Singh, during the reign of Maharaja Dungar Singh, the Mughal influence was greatly reduced and the painting of the area was inclined towards European influence
 bikaner chitra style kaa mukhya vishay-vastu bhagwat puraana, madhavanal kamkedala, chaur-panchasika, chaavand kii ragamala, rasik priya, baramasa, ramayana, devi mahatmaya, darbar, akhet, shringaarik vishay evam vyakti chithran rahaa he
 Apart from this, there has been a lot of marking of Chopar's Khoay etc
 by women- Shibika, Shal Bhanjika, heroine makeup, Purushkrida, Phirjariya with women
 komal or manomuddhakaari akritiyon ke saath-saath chitron main drushya chitra bhi sammishran bhi bade samichin dhang se kiya gaya he

 bikaner rajya kaa sampark mughal darbar se hone ke kaaran mughal style kaa prabhaav iske aarambhik kaal ke chitron main dekhne ko miltaa he
 Many reviewers consider it as a by-product of the provincial Mughal style, but the marking of the single tanwangi mriganaini soft lilies, the use of blue-green and red colors, the turban of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb as well as the high Marwari turban, camel, deer and Bikaneri The impression of living and Rajput culture inspires us to consider a different style
 raghubir singh kaa kathan he ki "mahaan mughalon ke shasankaal main jis nutan sammishrit bhartiya samskruti kaa udai hua tha, ab in raaj-darbaron main usee kaa punah samanvay or vikaas hone laga

 It is clear from the above discussion that the influence of Jodhpur is visible in the early paintings of the Bikaner painting style, but in the course of time, with the coordination of Mughal art, Rajasthani and Mughal painters have presented the form of art based on Hindu stories and Rajasthani poetry
 is
 yahan ke chitrakaar musalmaan the, jinhone hindu vishyon par chithran karke udaar drushtikon kaa parichay diya
 Bikaner painting style has its own special place and importance in Rajasthani painting with fine lines, soft and dynamic lines, bright and soft colors

 In Canada, the natives' residential school system was a system of residential schools for natives

 ras vah gunvattta he jo kalakaar or daskaar ke bich samaj utpann karti he
 At the Sabdika level, rasa means that which can be tasted or enjoyed
 natya shaastra ke chathe paath main, lekhak bharat ne sanskrit main likhaa he " vibhavanubhava vyabhichari baiyogichaari nishpathihi" arthath vibhaav, anubhav or vyabhichari ke milan se ras kaa janm hota he
 Just as people eat delicious food, which is made of spices, rice and other things, the juice they experience and are happy, in the same way, they are filled with joy and satisfaction by experiencing lasting emotion and other emotions
 is bhav ko tab 'natya ras' kaahaa jaataa he
 Some people are of the opinion that the rise of rasa and bhava occurs with their union
 lekin yah baat sahi nahin he, kyonki raso kaa janm bhaavo se hota he parantu bhaavo kaa janm raso se nahin hota he
 For this reason, Bhavos are considered to be the origin of Raso
 jis prakaar masaale, sabji or good ke saath swaad yaa ras banaaya ja sake usee prakaar sthai bhav or anya bhaavon se ras banaaya ja saktaa he or aisa koi sthaibhav nahin he jo ras kii vruddhi nahin karata or isi prakaar sthayibhav, vibhaav, anubhav or vyabhichari bhaavon se ras kii vruddhi hoti he
 The sentiment gives meaning to the viewer
 use bhav isiliye kahte hai kyoki yah kavita kaa vishay, shaareerik kriya or maansik bhaawanaaon darshako tak pahunchaata he
 Bhava 'bhavita' is formed from words like 'vasita' and 'prakrita' which means to be
 vibhaav vajah yaa kaaran yaa prerana hota he
 This is called Vibhava because these words describe the body, gestures and mental feelings
 vibhaav do prakaar kaa hota he : This is the main reason for the creation of emotion
 jab bhav ek aadmi yaa vastu yaa karm kii vajah se aakaar letaa he use alambhan vibhaav kehete hai
 When an object stimulates emotion such as qualities, action, decoration, atmosphere etc
 jiskaa udbhav vaakya or angabhinay se hota he use anubhav kehete hai
 This is a result of the effect
 yah ek vyakti dwaara mahasoos abhivyakti bhaavnaatmak bhavanaaen hai
 There are four types of estimation
 satvik, kayik, maansik tathaa aahrya
 The juice is born in a permanent sense
 The feeling which is stable and universal is called permanent feeling
 vibhaav anubhav or vyabhichaar sthaayee bhaavon kaa adheen hote hai
 That is why the permanent sense becomes important
 sthaayee bhav bhaawanaaon se banataa he or vyabhichaar encilri hoti he |jab sthaayee vyabhichaari vibhaav or anubhav se sangyojan hota he tab ras banataa he |naatyashaastra main kehete hai ki " ek acha swaad kaa utpaadan kiya jaataa he jab vibhinn masaale ek saath milaate he, vaise hi sthaayee bhav se ras kaa swaad badhata he |" It is a matter of pride that emotion plays a major part in the production of sentimentality
 ras kaa utpaadan bhav ke bina nahin ho saktaa | is prakaar se sthaayee bhav ras ke naam main mashur he |sthaayee bhav 8 hota he Some folk also associate with it
 ras kii or vastu yaa vichaar kaa netritv karte he use sanchari bhav kehete he

 The satvic sense is like 8
 nrity or naatak main 8 rasa hoti he | in 8 raso ko brahma ne prakhyapit kiya tha
 Those are juices in raso ke saath ek or ras he shaat | shaat ras bharat kaa yogadan tha
 | is 9 ras main se 4 ras moulik ras he | wo hai - shringaar, raudra, vir or vibhats| in chaar moulik ras se baaki 9 ras kaa udbhav hua he
 There is the emergence of humor from makeup, the rise of Karun from Raudra, the emergence of the wonderful from the heroic and the emergence of the terrible from the horrors
 kuch rangon kaa bhi ras ke varnan karne ke liye upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 On the color side, there is also a god for every juice
 shringaar kaa bhav rati naamak sthaayee manobhaav se utpann hota he
 Anything that is improved and radiant in this world is called Shringar
 yah bhav purush, stri or ujjwal yuvon se sambandhit he
 This means that it relates to the love between man and woman and its consequences
 is avadhi dwaara ek bahut gahari samaj avgat ko karaayaa jaataa he, shringaar avadhi kaa matlab he saundarya
 Therefore Shringar Lahiri is also called Beauty Lahiri
 pyaar manushya kaa saundarya he or yahi pyaar use ek alag pahchaan detii he or use sabhi kritiyon main sarvocch banaati he
 This juice has two chairs; That is, love in breath and love in separation
 sukhad mausam, maala, gahane, log, achche ghar, sukhon kaa anand, udyaan ke yaatren, saundarya kii baaten sunne or dekhne or aadi vibhaavon se sambhog shringaar utpann hota he
 This gesture is represented by skillful movement of eyes, eyebrows etc
 iske bhaavnaayen aalasy, ugrata or jugupsa ko chhodkar anya tees bhaavnaayen he
 Sambhog Shringar is again divided into two parts, which are as follows: sankshipt shringaar ko satvik bhav or shame dwaara dikhaaya jaataa he or judaai ke baad punarmilan or pyaar se bhari abhivyakti ko sampann sambhog kaha jaataa he
 Variations of separation in love by Nirveda, Gnani, Skunk, Asuya, Shrama, Sintha, Utsukta, impulse, fear, nostalgia, depression, sleeplessness, silence, enlightenment, distress, hysteria, aphorism, inertia, fascination, death, etc
 Is represented
 raas prakaaran vipralambh ko do bhaagon main baanta he; Before meeting her sweetheart, actress Dasha is said to be an unqualified retriever
 yah "mugdh nayika "me dekha jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye: shaadi se pehale parvati kaa pyaar shiv ji ke liye or rukmini kaa pyaar krushan ke liye
 The disqualified retrospective can be shown mainly from ten ways, such as: viprayog do tarah ke hote he: abhaav se utpann hone vaali judaai or asantosh se utpann hone vaali judaai
 The separation arising from absence is called migration, this is seen in the actress named Prokshitapriya
 asantosh se utpann hone vaali judaai, do premi jo ki ek duusare ko dekhnaa nahin chaahate yaa ek duusare ko aalangan nahin karnaa chaahate, ke bich paidaa hota he
 This is again of two types: haasya bhav kaa janm hasya naamak sthaayee yaa pramukh manodasha se hoti he
 It is produced by determinants such as Vikratpravesh, Dhrishta, Vikratlankara, Laulya, Kuhaka, Asatapralap, Satyadarshana, and Dosodhana, etc
 yah oshathaspandan, nasaspandan, capolspandan, drushtivyakos, drushtakunchan, swead, asyarag, persevyagrah or aadi ishaaron se dikhaaya jaat he
 There are two types of humor: when someone laughs with himself, then he is called atmaast and when someone laughs at others, it is called prastha

 It is produced by separation from your relatives and relatives, loss of money, loss of life, imprisonment, flight, misdemeanor, etc
 by other determinants
 ashrupat, parivednaa, mukhashoshna, vaivaranya, swarbhed, nishwaas, or smritilop, se iskaa pratinidhitiv hota he
 Nirveda, guilt, eagerness, impulse, fascination, shrama, sadism, dainya, vyadhi, jadata, unmatha, apasmratrasa, alsya, maran etc
 are its other biting feelings
 stambh, siharan, vaivaranya, ashru or swarbhed iske satvik bhav he
 Karun Ras also arises from the sight of the beloved, or the hearing of unpleasant words
 iskaa pratinidhitiv jor jor se rone, vilaap, foot foot ke rone or aadi dwaara hota he
 Has taken shape with a permanent emotion called raudra rage
 or yah aamtaur par rakshason daanvo or bure aadamiyo main utbhav hota he
 And this is generated by determinants like Krodhakarsana, Adhikasheep, Awamana, Advaratvika Adirodra on three sides - Roudra from Bol, Roudra from Nedhya and Roudra from Aag
 vir kaa bhav utsaah naamak sthaayee manodasha se utapann hota he
 The spirit of valor derives specialness from people of superior nature and energetic enthusiasm

 It is of three types: bhayanak kaa bhav bhay naamak sthaayee manodasha se utapann hota he

 bahut se vidyut yaa electronic ghatakon yaa avyavon ko jodakar vidyut paripath banate hai
 There are two types of components that can be added to a circuit: hierarchy and parallelogram
 jis paripath main sabhi ghatak shreneekram main jude hon, use shrenee paripath or jis paripath main sabhi ghatak samanaantar kram main jude hon use samanaantar paripath kaha ja saktaa he
 In the series circuit, the same current flows through each component, while in the parallel circuit, the same voltage is available on each component
 shrenee paripathon main prayek ghatak kaa karyrat rahanaa aavashyak he, anyathaa paripath tut jaayegaa
 The remaining components will continue to function even if any component in the sequence circuits is defective, but the entire circuit may be short-circuited if any component is short-circuited
 yadi kisi paripath main kisi sthaan par 10 om ke pratirodh kii aavashyaktaa he kintu vah uplabdh nahin he kintu 5-5 om ke do pratirodh sulabh hai to inako shreneekram main jodakar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if two resistors of 20–20 ohm are available, adding them in parallel, the equivalent resistance of 10 ohm is obtained
 dedh-do volt sahan kar sakane vaale saikadon balbon ko shreneekram main jodakar 230 volt se gharelu bijli se unako jagamagaaya jaataa he
 If 24 volts are needed somewhere, 24 volts can be obtained by connecting two 12 volt batteries in series
 paripathon main bhinn prakaar ke avyav bhi shreneekram yaa samaantarkram main jude ho sakate hai udhaaharan ke liye diod kii raksha ke liye uske shreneekram main upyukt maan kaa fus laga diya jaataa he; yaa pankhe ko chaalu / band karne ke liye uske shreneekram main ek switch daalaa jaataa he
 In the same way, a diode is inserted in its parallel in order to avoid voltage in the reverse direction in an electrolytic capacitor
 kisi sthaan par 2 ampir dhara vahan kar sakane vaala diod lagaana ho to 1 ampear dhara vahan kar sakane vaale do diod samaantarkram main laga dene se bhi kaam chal saktaa he
 When two or more components of electricity are connected in such a way that the same current flows in them, it is called hierarchy
 arthath, shreneekram main jude sabhi avyavon main prayek kshan ek samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he
 However, the potential difference between the ends of those individual components depends on the electrical properties of those components
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi 10 om, 20 om or 50 om ke teen pratirodhon ko shreneekram main joda gaya ho or 10 om vaale pratirodh main 2 ampiore dhara bah rahi ho to 20 om evam 50 om vaale pratirodhon main bhi 2 ampear dhara pravaahit ho rahi hogi
 But the potential of these three resistors will vary
 samaantar kram main jude do yaa adhik 'do siron vaale' vidyut avyavon main sabhi ke siron ke bich vibhavaantar samaan hota he kintu inamen se hokar bahane vaali dhara alag-alag ho sakati he jo un avyavon ke pratirodh, prerakatv, dharita evam anya baton par nirbhar karti he
 Electric bulbs, fans, tube lights etc
 are all connected in parallel in the houses
