 Once Nandkishore told the Sanatkumaras that the stigma which was imposed on Sri Krishna by seeing Chauth's moon was overcome by fasting Siddhi Vinayak
 aisa sunakar sanatkumaron ko aashcharya hua
 When he asked Purna Brahm Sri Krishna the story of stigma, Nandkishore told
 ek baar jarasandh ke bhay se shrikrishna samudr ke madhya nagari basaakar rahane lage
 Nowadays the name of this city is Dwarikapuri
 dwarikapuri main nivas karne vaale satrajit ne suryanarayan kii aradhana kii
 Then Lord Surya gave him a gem called Syamantaka, which gave him eighty pieces of gold, from his neck
 mani paakar satrajit jab samaaj main gaya to shrikrishna ne us mani ko praapt karne kii ichha vyakt kii
 Satrajit did not give the gem to Shri Krishna and gave it to his brother Prasenjit
 ek din prasenjit ghode par chadhakar shikaar ke liye gaya
 There a lion killed him and took the gem
 richon kaa raja jamvant us singh ko markar mani lekar gupha main chalaa gaya
 When Prasenjit did not return from hunting for several days, Satrajit felt very sad
 usne sochaa, shrikrishna ne hi mani praapt karne ke liye uskaa vadh kar diya hoga
 So, without gathering any kind of information, he preached that Shri Krishna killed Prasenjit and took away the Samantaka gem
 is lok-ninda ke nivaaran ke liye shrikrishna bahut se logon ke saath prasenjit ko dhundne van main gaye
 There, he got the symbols to kill Prasenjit by a lion and kill the lion by bear
 rich ke pairon kii khoj karte-karte ve jamvant kii gupha par pahunche or gupha ke bheetar chale gaye
 There he saw that the daughter of Jamwant is playing with that gem
 shrikrishna ko dekhte hi jamvant yuddh ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 War broke out
 gupha ke baahar shrikrishna ke saathiyon ne unki saat din tak pratiksha kii
 Then, repenting that they had died, they returned to Dwarikapuri
 idhar ikkis din tak lagaataar yuddh karne par bhi jamvant shrikrishna ko parajeet na kar sakaa
 Then he thought, is this avatar for which i got the blessing of Ramchandraji
 yah pushti hone par usne apni kanya kaa vivaah shrikrishna ke saath kar diya or mani dahej main de di
 When Shri Krishna came back with the gem, Satrajit was very ashamed of his actions
 is lajja se mukt hone ke liye usne bhi apni putree kaa vivaah shrikrishna ke saath kar diya
 After some time Sri Krishna went to Indraprastha for some work
 tab akrur tathaa ritu verma kii raay se shatadhanva ne satrajit ko markar mani apane kabje main le lee
 When Shri Krishna received the news of Satrajit's death, he immediately reached Dwarka
 ve shatadhanva ko markar mani chhinane ko taiyaar ho gaye
 Balaram was also ready to assist in this task
 yah jaanakar shatadhanva ne mani akrur ko de di or swayan bhaag niklaa
 Shri Krishna followed her and killed her, but Mani could not find them
 balraamji bhi vahaan pahunche
 Sri Krishna tells him that Mani is not near it
 balraamji ko vishwaas na hua
 Unhappy he went to Vidarbha
 shrikrishna ke dwarika lautne par logon ne unka baari apmaan kiya
 Immediately news spread that in the greed of Syamantak Mani, Shri Krishna also abandoned his brother
 shrikrishna is akaaran praapt apmaan ke shok main duube the ki sahasaa vahaan naradji aa gaye
 He told Shri Krishna ji - You saw the moon of Bhadrapad Shukla Chaturthi
 isi kaaran aapako is tarah laanchit hona padaa he
 Sri Krishna asked- What has happened to the moon of Chauth due to which a person is stained with his vision
 tab naradji bole- ek baar brahmaji ne chaturthi ke din ganeshji kaa vrath kiya tha
 When Ganeshji asked to ask for the groom, he asked that i should not be tempted to create the universe
 ganeshji jyon hi 'tathastu' kahkar chalane lage, unke vicitra vyaktitv ko dekhakar chandramaane uphaas kiya
 Ganeshji was angry at this and cursed the moon that from today no one would want to see your face
 shaap dekar ganeshji apane lok chale gaye or chandramaa maansarovar kii kumudiniyon main ja chipa
 Without the moon, the creatures suffered greatly
 unke ksht ko dekhakar brahmaji kii ajna se saare devataaon ke vrath se prasann hokar ganeshji ne vardaan diya ki ab chandramaa shaap se mukt to ho jayega, par bhadrapada shukla chaturthi ko jo bhi chandramaa ke darshan karegaa, use chori aadi kaa jhootha laanchhan jarur lagegaa
 But the person who continues to see every second, will be saved from this stigma
 is chaturthi ko siddhi vinayak vrath karne se saare dosha chhot jaayenge
 Hearing this, the gods went to their respective places
 is prakaar bhadrapada shukla chaturthi ko chandramaa kaa darshan karne se aapako yah kalank laga he
 Then Sri Krishna fasted to get rid of the stigma
 kurukshetra ke yuddh main yudhisthir ne bhagwaan shrikrishna se poocha- bhagwan! manushya kii manokamana siddhi kaa koun-sa upaay he? kis prakaar manushya dhan, putr, saubhaahgya tathaa vijay praapt kar saktaa he? yah sunakar shrikrishna ne uttar diya- yadi tum parvati putr shri ganesh kaa vidhipurvak pujan karo to nishchay hi tumhen sab kuch praapt ho jayega
 Then on the orders of Shri Krishna, Yudhishthiraji won the war of Mahabharata by fasting on Ganesh Chaturthi
 yahi chaturth ganesh chaturthi naam se prasiddh he

 Integrated Pest Management is a system in which farmers must use more than one method, such as behavioral, mechanical, biological and chemical control, in order to protect crops from harmful insects and diseases, so that the number of crops are damaged
 Stay below economic level and use chemical medicines only when others are not successful in the adopted way Are vyavasthit nigaraanee rakhana

 At the present time, while the introduction of good varieties and adopting good crop management has led to significant increase in crop yield, on the other hand, due to physical, biological crop changes in the agro-ecological system, the variety of insect diseases in the crop also increased

 Keeping a close watch on all these bad effects, the Government of India has either stopped production and use of some of the more toxic pesticide medicines or has ensured to use them only on a few crops

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavadgita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is the Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he
 Among all the languages available on the Bhagavad Gita, the element of Shri Jayadayal Goindka is the most popular and popular
 iskaa prakaashan gitapress ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Aaj Tak has sold 100 million copies
 shrimadbhagavadgita badalte saamaajik paridrishyon main apni mahatta ko banaae hue hai or isi kaaran takneekee vikaas ne isaki uplabdhta ko badhaayaa he, tathaa adhik bodhgamy banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 In the serial Mahabharata, aired on Doordarshan, Bhagavad Gita was a special attraction, while in the serial Sri Krishna, the Bhagwad Gita was highly researched and shown as a series of episodes
 isaki ek vishesh baat yah rahi ki gita se sambandhit saamaanya manushya ke sandehon ko arjuna ke prashnon ke madhyam se uttarit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Apart from this, the serial gita-rahasya by Nitish Bhardwaj was completely focused on different dimensions of Gita itself
 internet par bhi aaj anekanek websiten is vishay par bahumadhyamon ke dwaara vishad jaankaree detii hai
 Shrimad Bhagwadgita is currently attracting attention of people not only in India but also abroad with her philosophical approach towards life more than religion
 nishkaam karm kaa gita kaa sandesh prabandhan guruon ko bhi lubhaa rahaa he
 It is included in the most famous books of all religions of the world
 gita press gorakhpur jaisi dharmik sahitya kii pustakon ko kaaphi kam mulya par uplabdh karaane vaale prakaashan ne bhi kai aakaar main arth or bhashya ke saath shrimadbhagavadgita ke prakaashan dwaara ise aam janata tak pahunchane main kaaphi yogadan diya he
 The teachings of the Gita are very ancient yoga
 shri bhagavan kehete hai ise maine sabase pehle surya se kaha tha
 The Sun is the symbol of knowledge, so the words of Shri God mean that even before the creation of the earth, i have given this knowledge to the devotees who have done many forms of research
 yah ishwariya vaani he jisamen sampoorn jivan kaa saar he evam aadhaar he
 Who am I? What is this body? Is my beginning and end with this body? Will i exist after my body renunciation? Where and in what form will this existence exist? What is the reason for me coming into the world? What will happen after leaving my body, where will i go? These things keep revolving in the heart of any curious person
 ham sadaa in baton ke bare main sochate hai or apane ko, apane swaroop ko nahin jaan pate
 In the Gita Shastra, the answers to all these questions have been readily given by Shri Bhagwan through religious dialogue
 is deh ko jisamen 36 tatv jeevatma kii upasthiti ke kaaran judakar kaary karte hai, kshetra kaha he or jeevatma is kshetra main nivas karata he, vahi is deh kaa swami he parantu ek teesraa purush bhi he, jab vah prakat hota he; adhidaiv arthath 36 tatwon vaale is deh ko or jeevatma kaa naash kar daalata he
 This perfect man is the ultimate state and ultimate truth
 yahi nahin, deh main sthit or deh tyagkar jate hue jeevatma kii gati kaa yatharth vaigyanik env tarksangat varnan gita shaastra main hua he
 The soul is eternal and the soul has attained the spirit of life
 sharir ke mar jane par jeevatma apane karmanusaar vibhinn yoniyon main vicharan karata he
 The Gita begins with the word Dharma and at the end of the eighteenth chapter of the Gita it is called Dharma Samvad
 dharm kaa arth he dhaaran karne vaala athwa jise dhaaran kiya gaya he
 The one who holds is called the soul and the one who holds it is nature
 aatma is sansar kaa beej arthath pita he or prakruti garbhadhaaran karne vaali yoni arthath mata he
 The word Dharma is used in the Gita from place to place for self-nature and living nature
 isi paripeksh main dharm evam adharm ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The nature of the soul is religion or it is said that religion is spirit
 aatma kaa swabhaav he purna shuddh gyaan, gyaan hi anand or shaanti kaa akshay dham he
 On the contrary, ignorance signifies unrest, tribulation and unrighteousness
 aatma akshay gyaan kaa strot he
 Kriya Shakti arises from different amounts of knowledge power, birth of nature
 prakruti ke gun satva, raj, tam kaa janm hota he
 Excess of sattva-raja gives rise to religion, demonic circles prevail in excess of tam-raja and the establishment of dharma means to establish the nature of virtues, for the growth of satoguna, soul attaining indestructible Brahmi status, its resolve She incarnates herself and performs incarnation
 sampoorn gita shaastra kaa nichod he buddhi ko hameshaa sookshm karte hue mahabuddhi aatma main lagaaye rakkho tathaa sansar ke karm apane swabhaav ke anusaar saral rup se karte raho
 It is easy to do nature's karma and it is difficult to follow the other's nature's karma, because every living being is born with a different nature, it becomes easy to live in the nature that has come into the world
 shri bhagwaan ne sampoorn gita shaastra main baar-baar atmrat, aatm sthit hone ke liye kaha he
 It is easy for the intellect to become detached while doing natural deeds, so it is considered the definitive path
 yadhyapi alag-alag dekha jaay to gyaan yoga, buddhi yoga, karm yoga, bhakthi yoga aadi kaa gita main upadesh diya he parantu sookshm drushti se vichaar kiya jaay to sabhi yoga buddhi se shri bhagwaan ko arpan karte hue kiye ja sakate hai isse anasakt yoga nishkaam karm yoga swatah siddh ho jaataa he
 Just as before Newton the force of gravity worked, but Newton gave the terms of the term to make the world aware of the proclaimed principles of "law of gravity", which is known as Newton's theory of gravitation
 thik usee prakaar sree krishna dwaara gita main pratipaadit tatv gyaan krishna ke pehle bhi tha, jo aaj srimad bhagavad gita ke rup main prachlit he

 sampoorn bhagwat gita hindi va sanskrit main PDF RNA interference is a system inside living cells that helps control which genes are active and how active they are
 arene anuon ke do chote prakaar - microarene or laghu hastkshep karne vaale arene - arene hastkshep ke kendra main hote hai
 rnas are direct products of genes, and these small rnas can bind to other specific rnas and either increase or decrease their activity, for example they can prevent a messenger RNA from producing proteins
 koshikaon ko paraseete jeenon - virus evam transposon - se bachaane main arene hastkshep kii mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he, lekin saadhaarant: yah vikaas ke nirdesan ke saath hi jin abhivyakti main bhi apni bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The rnai pathway is found in many eukaryotes with animals and is initiated by the enzyme dicer, which splits long double-stranded RNA molecules into smaller fragments of ~ 20 nucleotides
 guide strand ke rup main gyaat tukade ke do strand main se ek ko tab arene-prerit sailencing complex main nigamit kiya jaataa he
 The best result of the study is posttranscriptional gene silencing, which arises when the guide strand connects with the complementary sequence of the base messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by argonaut, a catalytic component of the RISC complex
 ise sirna ke shuruuaati rup main simit dadh sandratha ko chhodkar daihik rup se sabhi jeevadhariyon main fail jane vaali prakriya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The selected and strong effect of dsrna on gene expression makes it an important research, only in cell culture and living organisms, because synthetic dsrna entering the cell can induce pressure from particular genes of interest
 rnai baari paimaane ke screen ke liye bhi upyog main laayaa ja saktaa he jo yojanabaddh tareeke se prayek jin ko koshika main band kar saktaa he, jo ek vishesh koshikeey prakriya yaa koshika vibhaajan kii ghatana ke liye jaruri ghatakon kii pahtaan main sahaayta kar saktaa he
 The use of this route can be a promising tool for biotechnology and medicine
 aitihaasik rup se, arene hastkshep ko post tronscriptional jin sailencing or queling kii tarah hi anya naam se jaataa jaataa tha
 It was only after fully understanding these apparently unrelated processes that it was clear that they all explain the fact of rnai

 elegans main arene hastkshep par unke kaam ke liye diya gaya, jise unhone 1998 main prakashit kiya
 rnai is an rna-dependent gene silencing process that is regulated by rna-induced silencing complexes and is initiated by small double-stranded RNA molecules in the cell's cytoplasm, where they interact with the catalytic RISC component argonaut
 We do
 jab dsrna exogens hote hai, tab arene ko sidhe cytoplasm main aaayaatit kiya jaataa he or anzime disar dwaara chote tukdon main vibhajit kar diya jaataa he
 The introduction of dsrna can also be endogenous, eg, by microrna-expressing RNA prior to gene coding-s in the genome
 is tarah ke jin ke praathmik tronscript nabhik main purv-mirna ke abhilakshanik stem-loop sanrachana ke nirmaan kii pehali prakriya hote hai, iske baad ve disar ke dwaara vibhajit kiye jane ke liye cytoplasm main bheje jate hai
 Thus, two dsrna pathways lead to exogenous and endogenous risk complexes

 Bioinformatics studies on the genomes of many organisms suggest that this length increases target-gene specificity to the maximum extent and minimizes non-specific effects
 in chote dugane-dhanse hue tukdon ko laghu hastkshepak esaiarenees kaha jaataa he
 These sirnas are then split into single strands and integrated into an active RISC complex
 aaraiessi main ekikaran ke baad, sirnas aadhaar-jode se unke lakshya mrna or mrna ke prerit daraar, ke falswaroop ise rupantaran template ke rup main upyog kiye jane se roktaa he
 Exogenous dsrna is identified and regulated by an effector protein known as RDE-4 in C
 elegans and R2D2 in Drosophila, which stimulates dicer activity
 yah protein keval lambey dsrnas ko parisimit karata he, lekin is lambaai vishistataa kaa nirmaan karne vaali pranali agyaat he
 These rna-binding proteins then facilitate transfer from the spliced sirna to the RISC complex

 These sirnas are structurally distinct from dicer-produced sirnas and appear to be produced by an rna-dependent RNA polymerase
 microarene jinomic rup se kodit kiye gaye non-koding rnas hote hai jo jin abhivyakti ko, vishesh rup se vikaas ke dauraan, viniyamit karte hai
 Broadly defined, the phenomenon of RNA interference involves endogenously induced gene silencing effects of mirnas as well as silencing activated by external dsrna
 paripakv mirnas sanrachanaatmak rup se exogens se utpaadit sirnas ke samaan hote hai, lekin paripakv hone ke pehle mirnas ko sabase pehle vyapak post-tronscriptional sanshodhan se jarur guzarana chahie
 mirna is expressed as a primary transcript known as pri-mirna by a very long rna-coding gene called a pre-mirna, a 70-nucleotide stem-loop structure, in the cell nucleus, by the microprocessor complex
 Is processed till yah complex drosha naamak ek rnase III anzime or ek diesarene-binding protein pasha se bana hota he
 This dsrna portion of the pre-mirna is bound and split by dicer to produce mature mirna molecules that can be integrated into the RISC complex; Thus, mirna and sirna share the same cellular machinery in their early processing toward flow
 lambey dsrna pricursor se vyutpann sirnas un mirnas se bhinn mirnas he, visheshkar unase jo pashuon main hote hai, jinamein lakshya ko liye adhure aadhaar jod hote hai or jo samaan kramyukt bahut saare mrnas ke roopanantaran ko rokte hai
 In contrast, sirnas typically form base-pairs from the complete PUP and induce mrna cleavage in only a single, fixed target
 drosophila or si
 elegns main, mirna or sirna sunishchit argonot protein or disar anzime dwaara prasanskrit kiye jate hai
 The active components of an rna-induced silencing complex are target endonuclease called argonaut proteins that divide the target mrna strands interrelated with their bound sirna
 chunki disar dwaara utpaadit tukade dabl-stranded hote hai, siddhatat: ve sabhi ek kaaryaatmak sirna ho sakate hai
 However, only one of the two strands, known as the guide strand, binds the Argonaut protein and directs gene silencing
 anya anti-guide strand yaa paisanger strand iaressi sakriyan ke dauraan nimna kar die jate hai
 Although it was previously believed that an ATP dependent helicase separated the n two strands, this process is indeed atp-dependent and is directly carried out by the protein components of iscs
 guide ke rup main chaynit strand is tarah kaa hota he jiskaa 5' chor iske ghatak se bahut kam judaa hota he, lekin strand chayan us nrdes ke dwaara aprabhavi kar diya jaataa he jisamen athaiessi nigamikaran ke pehle disar dsrna ko vibhajit kar detaa he
 Instead, the R2D2 protein acts as a segregation factor by binding the more-stable 5 'end of the passenger strand
 arain ko argonot protein se baandhne ke liye sanrachanaatmak aadhaar ko ek arene-bound argonot protein ke binding domen ke eks-re crystalography dwaara parakshit kiya gaya
 Here, the phosphorylated 5 'end of the RNA strand enters a conserved baseline surface pocket and forms a contact with a develant cation such as magnesium and this contact by aromatic stacking between the 5' neocliotoid of sirna and the accumulated tyrosine residue
 is site kaa vichaar tha ki sirna ko iske mrna se baandhne ke liye ek neucliation kaa nirmaan kiya jaae
 It is not understood how the activated RISC complex localizes complementary mrnas within the cell
 haalanki vipatan prakriya ko roopantaran se jodne ke liye prastaavit kiya gaya he lekin mrna kaa roopantaran rnai-mediated ksharan ke liye aavashyak nahin he
 Indeed, rnai can be very effective against mrna targets that are not mutated
 The catalytic components of the Argonaut protein, RISC, are located in specialized regions of the cytoplasm known as the P-body, which are regions of rapid degradation of mrna, with mirna activity also being clustered
 pi-body kaa vighatan arene hastkshep kii kshamta ko kam kar detaa he, yah suzav dete hue ki ye rnai prakriya main ek jatil kadam vaale site hai
 RNA interference pathway components are used in many eukaryotes to repair the organization and their genome structure

 This complex of fission yeast contains argonaut, a chromodomain protein CHP1 and a Tas3 protein with unknown function
 parinaam ke rup main, hetrocromatic kshetron ke preran or vistaar ke liye argonot or rdrp protein kii jarurat hoti he
 In fact, deletion of these genes in yeast fission S

 kuch maamalon main, histone sanshodhan se judi isi tarah kii prakriyaaon ko, lipyantarnataa aparegulate jin ke liye dekha gaya he
 The mechanism by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization has not been properly understood and most studies have focused on the mating-type region of fission yeast, which is representative of the activities of other genomic regions or organisms
 May not be
 maujuuda hetrocromautin kshetron ke rakrakhaav main, local jin ke poorak ke rup main RITS ek sirnas yukt complex kaa nirmaan karata he or sthir rup se local mithailated histones ko baandhta he or yah kaary vah kisi nacent purv-emarene tronscript, jo arene polimirej dwaara shuru kiye jate hai, ko ksharit karne ke liye sah-lipyantarnataa se kaary karte hue karata he
 a formation of such a heterochromatin region, although not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, probably because the dicer needs to form the initial components of sirnas that target subsequent transcripts

 The results of observations obtained from the fission yeast mating-type region and centromere for mammals are unclear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of components of the rnai pathway

 RNA interference can be an important part of the immune response to viruses and other foreign genetic substances, especially in plants where it can inhibit self-expansion by transposons
 aerobidopsis thaliana jaise paudhe bahu homolog disar ko abhivyakt karte hai jinhen bhinn tareeke se pratikriya karne ke liye visheshikrut kiya jaataa he jab paudhon ko vibhinn prakaar ke virus ke liye anaavruth kiya jaataa he
 Even before the rnai pathway was fully understood, it was known that induced gene silencing in plants could spread throughout the plant with a systemic effect and could be transferred from stock to zion plants via grafting

 In his discovery of muscle protein production, he observed that neither mrna nor antisense RNA injection had any effect on protein production, but double-stranded RNA silenced the targeted gene
 After the result of this work, he coined the term rnai
 The discovery of Fire and Mello was particularly notable, as it represented the first identification of the causative agent for the event

 In geometry, two sets of points are called mutually congruent if one of them can be obtained by moving, rotating, reflecting, or converting them with mixed actions
 sarvangasam = sarv + ang + sam = sabhi ang baraabar
 In a more simple way, it can be said that if two pictures are similar in shape, then they are congruent
 yadi do tribhujon kii teenon bhujaayen evam sangat kone samaan hon to ve paraspar sarvangasam hote hai
 But usually, showing only the equality of the three relevant organs is enough to prove congruency
 SAS : yadi do tribhujon kii do sangat bhujaayen or unke bich ke kone samaan hon to ve sarvangasam hai
 SSS: If all the three sides of one triangle are equal to the three corresponding sides of the other triangle, then both triangles are congruent
 ASA : Two triangles are congruent if a pair of corresponding angles and the included side are equal
the ASA Postulate was contributed by Thales of Miletus 
 In most systems of axioms, the three criteria - SAS, SSS and ASA - are established as theorems
 In the School Mathematics Study Group system SAS is taken as one of 22 postulates
 AAS : Two triangles are congruent if a pair of corresponding angles and a not-included side are equal, since the 3rd angle would have to be equal, and therefore the side would be included
 This one is valid only in Euclidean geometry
 The SSA condition which specifies two sides and a non-included angle) does not always prove congruence
 Specifically, SSA does not prove congruence when the angle is acute and the opposite side is shorter or equal to the adjacent side but longer than the sine of the angle times the adjacent side
 This is the ambiguous case
 In all other cases, SSA proves congruence
 Notice that the opposite side cannot be smaller than the adjacent side times the sine of the angle as this could not describe a triangle
 The SSA condition proves congruence if the angle is obtuse or right
 In the case of the right angle condition), we can calculate the third side and fall back on SSS
 The SSA condition proves congruence if the angle is acute and the opposite side either equals the adjacent side times the sine of the angle or is longer than the adjacent side
 AAA In this case, both triangles are only congruent, not necessarily congruent
 aisa isaliye he ki yah sthiti aakaar ke bare main kuch bhi nahin kahati
 However, if we talk about spherical geometry or hyperbolic geometry, then this condition is sufficient for congruency
 i love is called AAA angle

 isamen ek oonchi chat ke saath ek bada gumbad bhi he
 The system originally provided for the Supreme Court by the Constitution of India enacted a Chief Justice and seven other judges and the task of increasing this number was left to Parliament
 praarambhik varshon main, nyaayalay ke samaksh prastut maamalon ko sunne ke liye ucchtam nyaayalay kii puri peeth ek saath baitha karti thi
 As the court function increased and pending cases increased, the original number of judges was increased from eight by the Indian Parliament to eleven in 1956, fourteen in 1960, eighteen in 1978, twenty-six in 1986 and thirty-one in 2008

 The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court essentially consults the group of four senior-most judges before advising the President in this context and advises the President on the basis of the advice received from this group
 anu 124 ke anusaar mukhya nyaayadhish kii niyukti karte samay raashtrapati apni icchaanusaar sarvocch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhishon kii salaah legaa
 At the time of appointment of other judges, he will inevitably have to accept the advice of the Chief Justice, as per the judgment given in the Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association v

 In the case of reconsideration, again he will have to take the opinion of two senior judges
 He can also take the opinion of other judges of the High Court / Supreme Court, but all the opinions will always be in writing
 After changing his vote in the court, the court has changed the opinion of at least 4 judges
 It was made mandatory to consult with

 Philosophy is the knowledge that discusses the principles of truth and nature and their causes
 darshan yatharth kii parakh ke liye ek drushtikon he
 Philosophical thinking is basically synonymous with the pursuit of the economy of life
 vastutah darshanashastra swatv, arthath prakruti tathaa samaaj or maanav chintan tathaa sangyaan kii prakriya ke saamaanya niyamon kaa vigyaan he
 Philosophy is one of the forms of social consciousness
 darshan us vidya kaa naam he jo satya evam gyaan kii khoj karata he
 Philosophy, in a broad sense, is the art of rational, methodical and systematic thinking
 iskaa janm anubhav evam paristhiti ke anusaar hota he
 This is the reason that different people of the world adopted different types of life-philosophies from time to time according to their experiences and circumstances
 bhartiya darshan kaa itihaas atyant purana he kintu philosphi ke arthon main darshanashastra pad kaa prayog sarvapratham pithagoras ne kiya tha
 Plato developed philosophy as a specific discipline and science
 uski utpatti das-swami samaaj main ek aise vigyaan ke rup main hui jisane vastugat jagat tathaa swayan apane vishay main manushya ke gyaan ke sakal yoga ko aikyabaddh kiya tha
 This was completely natural due to the low level of development of knowledge in the early stages of human history
 saamaajik utpaadan ke vikaas or vaigyanik gyaan ke sanchay kii prakriya main bhinn bhinn vigyaan darshanashastra se pruthak hote gayi or darshanashastra ek swatantra vigyaan ke rup main viksit hone laga
 Philosophy was born as a distinct discipline with the need to expand the general view of the world and to develop general principles and rules, to develop rational, rational and rational principles of thinking about reality
 pruthak vigyaan ke rup main darshan kaa aadharbhoot prashn swatv ke saath chintan ke, bhootadravya ke saath chetana ke sambandh kii samasya he
 Philosophy is the analysis of various disciplines
 isaliye bhartiya darshan main chetana kii mimasaa anivaary he jo aadhunik darshan main nahin
 The ultimate goal of human life is the attainment of eternal bliss by getting rid of sorrows
 bhartiya darshanon kaa bhi ek hi lakshya dukhon ke mul kaaran agyaan se maanav ko mukti dilaakar use moksh kii prapti karwaanaa he
 That is, the main purpose of life is to achieve true knowledge by destroying ignorance and traditionalist and orthodox views
 sanathan kaal se hi maanav main jigyaasa or anveshan kii pravriti rahi he
 Apart from the emergence of nature and the position of the Sun, Moon and planets, the curiosity to know about God has also been there in humans
 in jigyaasaaon kaa shaman karne ke liye uske anwarat prayaas kaa hi yah fal he ki ham log itane viksit samaaj main rah rahe hai
 But the ancient sages-sages were neither satisfied with this material prosperity nor had ever attained everlasting joy

 drishyatehyaneneti darshanam That is, the knowledge of the seven elements and the seven is philosophy
 paashchaatya philospi shabd philos +sophia se milakar bana he
 Hence Philosophy literally means love of wisdom
 paashchaatya darshanik budhimaan yaa pragnavan vyakti bananaa chahta he
 The history of Western philosophy shows that the Western philosopher has wanted to be intelligent on the basis of subject knowledge
 iske vipareet kuch udhaaharan avashya milengen jisamen aacharan shuddhi tathaa manas kii parishuddhta ke aadhaar par paramsatta ke saath saakshaatkaar karne kaa bhi adarsh paaya jaataa he
 But this ideal is oriental and not westernized
 paashchaatya darshanik apane gyaan par jor detaa he or apane gyaan ke anuroop apane charitra kaa sanchaalan karnaa anivaary nahin samajhataa
 The only exceptions are Western mystics and socialist thinkers
 bhartiya darshan main param satta ke saath saakshaatkaar karne kaa doosraa naam hi darshan hai
 According to the Indian tradition, man can have a knowledge of ultimate power
 is prakaar saakshaatkaar ke liye bhakthi gyaan tathaa yoga ke maarg bataae gaye hai
 But philosophical knowledge is said to be different from scientific knowledge
 vaigyanik gyaan praapt karne main aalochay vishay main parivartan karnaa padataa he taaki use apni ichha ke anusaar vash main kiya ja sake or phir uskaa icchit upyog kiya ja sake
 But according to oriental philosophy, philosophical knowledge is the practice of life
 aise darshan se swayan darshanik main hi parivartan ho jaataa he
 He gets divine vision
 jiske dwaara vah samast praaniyon ko apni samshti drushti se dekhtaa he
 In contemporary ideology, oriental philosophy is considered to be religious philosophy and western philosophy is called language reform and clarification of suffixes
 darshanashastra anubhav kii vyakhya he
 In this interpretation, whatever is unclear is sought to be clarified
 hamaari gyanendriyaan baahar kii ore khulti hai, ham praaia: bahya jagat main villin rahete hai
 Sometimes we are focused and we see a new world
 tathy to dikhaai dete hi hai, naitik bhaavana aadesh bhi detii he
 The distinction of reality and possibility expresses the suffix of the ideal
 is pratyay ke prabhaav main ham upar kii ore dekhte hai
 In this way the main subjects of philosophy become external world, conscious soul and divine being
 inpar vichaar karte hue ham swabhaavat: inke sambandho par bhi vichaar karte hai
 In ancient times, the relationship between creation and creator was the main topic, in the medieval period, the relation of soul and God became the major subject and in modern times the relation of man and nature, matter and subject, became the center of Viven

 maanav gyaan kii seemayen kya hai? Gyanamimamsa attracted the attention of thinkers in modern times
 pehle darshan ko praaia: tatvagyan ke arth main hi liya jaataa tha
 The goal of philosophers was to find out the system of the whole
 jab kabhi prathit hua ki is anveshan main manushya kii buddhi aage ja nahin sakati, to kuch gaun siddhant vivechan ke vishay bane
 In Greece, this happened after Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, and in Germany after Kant and Hagel
 yatharthwaad or ndehwaad aise hi siddhant hai
 In this way, the subjects which have been specially discussed in philosophical discussion, these are: mukhya vishay - Minor subjects - in vishyon ko vichaarkon ne apni apni ruchi ke anusaar vividh pakshon se dekha he
 Someone has paid special attention to one side, someone on the other side

 vaise to samast darshan kii utpatti vedon se hi hui he, phir bhi samast bhartiya darshan ko aastik evam naastik do bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he

 In finance, the capital asset pricing model is used to determine the desired return rate theoretically appropriate for a capital asset when this asset is to be added to an already well-managed portfolio, and while that asset is Bad risks are known
 is model main parisampatti ke ashaakhneey jokhim jise vitt kshetra main praayah 'beta' ke dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he, ko gananaa main liya jaataa he tathaa bazaar ke pratyaashit pratilabh va saidhantik jokhim-mukt parisampatti ke pratyaashit pratilabh ko bhi
 CAMP suggests that the cost of share capital of an investor is determined by 'beta'
 ”:2 is model kaa vistrut rup dwi-beta model he, jo ki urdhvagami beta ko adhigami beta se bhinn karata he
 The concept of CPM was independently presented by Jack Treynor, William Sharpe, John Leintner and Jan Mosin, expanding the work done earlier by Harry Markowitz on diversification and modern portfolio theory
 1990 main shorpe, marcovitz va martan miller ko sanyukt rup se vittiya arthshaastra main yogadan ke liye nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Fisher Black developed another version of the CPM, the blackcapm, or the zero-beta CPM, which rejected the recognition of risk-free assets i went
 empirical testing main yah sanskaran adhik drudh tha tathaa siepiem kii vaishvik sweekruti main iskaa prabhavi yogadan rahaa
 Despite the advent of many modern methods of pricing and portfolio selection and arbitrage empirical flaws, CAPM is still more prevalent due to its generality and usefulness in a wide variety of circumstances
 siepiem kisi akeli parisampatti athwa parisampattiyon ke samooh kii keemat nirdhaaran karne ke liye ek model he
 For a single security, we use the securities market line and its relationship with expected return and systemic risk to determine how much the price of a single market will be determined by the market compared to its risk category
 pratibhuti bazaar rekha se kisi ek sampatti kii puure bazaar kii tulana main pratifal-jokhim anupaat kii gananaa bhi kii ja sakati he
 Hence, as the expected return of an asset will decrease by its beta coefficient, the return-risk ratio of this single asset will be equal to the return-risk ratio of the entire market
 is prakaar: The market-to-risk ratio is effectively the market risk premium / premium and by re-employing the above equation and assuming E, we get the capital asset pricing model
 jahaan: If this is rewritten from the risk premium point of view, we find that: arthath kisi parisampatti kaa "apana jokhim premium"- "bazaar jokhim premium" va "beta" kaa gunanfal he
 Note 1: The expected market returns are often estimated by taking a geometric average of the value of historical returns in a market-portfolio
 note 2: jokhim kii gananaa hetu prayukt 'jokhim mukt pratifal dar' praayah etihasik daron kaa arithmetic ausat hota he naa ki vartmaan dar
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 siepiem ko amaap adhivetan or vishisht jokhim shaamil karne ke liye sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 This is important for investors who do not have an advanced-diversified portfolio
 sameekaran parmparik siepiem sameekaran ke samaan hi he “jisamen bazaar jokhim adhivetan ko beta utpaa or bazaar jokhim adhivetan ke guna se pratisthapit kar diya gaya he:”:5 "where: pratibhuti bazaar rekha siepiem ke formula kaa graph ke rup main chithran karti he
 show the risk on the x axis and the expected return on the y axis
 bazaar jokhim kaa anumaan pratibhuti bazaar rekha kii dhalaan se lagaaya jaataa he
 The relationship between β and expected return is depicted on the securities market line, which represents the expected return as a function of β
 The intercept is the bazaar main uplabdh nominal jokhim mukt dar he, jabaki dhalaan market premium he, E− Rf
 It can be said that the securities market line represents as a single-factor model of the asset price, while β shows how likely it is to be affected by market changes, thus the SML equation is : aisi paristhitiyon ke liye yah ek ati mahatvapurn tul he jab pataa karnaa ho ki kya koi parisampatti / pratibhuti jokhim kii tulana main ek sweekaarya pratifal degi ki nahin
 Solitary assets are depicted on the securities market line graph
 yadi jokhim va pratifal kaa paraspar chithran rekha se upar hota he to iskaa arth he ki yah pratibhuti sasti mil rahi he or is par adhik laabh kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 If it falls below the illustration line, then the price should be considered expensive and it will not get as much profit as the risk is being taken
 siepim kaa upyog karte hue pratyaashit / vaanchhit labhdar e { \ displaystyle E} gyaat hone ke pashchaat isaki tulana sampatti ke anumaanit pratilabh dar se karke yah pataa laga sakate hai ki yah nivesh acha rahegaa ki nahin
 For this we will need to calculate an independent estimate of the return on assets, which is usually done by fundamental or technical analysis, proportional analysis, etc
 siepiem ke anusaar, yadi anumaanit mulya, sampatti ke siepiem dwaara sujhai dar ke saath samyojit kiye gaye bhavishya nakadapravaah ke baraabar he - to sampatti sahi mulya par mil rahi he
 If the estimated value is higher than the CAPM valuation, the property is cheaper
 kisi parisampatti kaa pratibhuti bazaar rekha par sthit nahin hona uske mulya main visangati ko darshata he
 Since the expected return of the property at timepoint t { \ displaystyle t} is e = e - p t p t { \ displaystyle e = { \ frac {E-P_ {t}} {P_ {t xxrep 5 } as suggested by the CAPM If the return exceeds, it means that p t { \ displaystyle P_ {t}} is too low, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t + 1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 siepiem kaa prayog karne par parisampatti kaa mulya p 0 { \ displaystyle P_{0}}, nimna leniyar sambandh se pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he: Where PT { \ displaystyle P_ {T}} is the payoff of the asset or portfolio
 siepiem dwaara pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi vishisht sampatti ke tulanaatmak jokhim ko dhyaan main rakhte hue uski apekshit vaapasi arthath samaayojan dar, kitni honi chahie
 If the value of beta is more than one, it means - above average risk; Less than one means - below average risk
 is prakaar, kisi zyada jokhim vaale stock kaa beta adhik hoga or unhen adhik dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 Whereas less sensitive stocks will have lower beta and will be adjusted at a lower rate
 yah prachlit anaupchaarik dharna, ki adhik jokhim lene vaale niveshak adhik pratifal kii ichha rakhte hai, ke anuroop hi he
 Because beta is the measure of the vulnerability of a single asset to full market risk, it is clear from the definition that beta will be a measure of market risk: 1
 bazaar jokhim maapne ke liye ek poorak paimaane ke rup main stock market index kaa prayog bahutayat main kiya jaataa he, atah inkaa beta maap 1 hota he
 Thus, investors of a large and well-defined portfolio can expect results from their investments according to market movements
 kisi bhi portpholio main maujuud jokhim pramukhtah do prakaar ke jokhimon kaa yoga hota he - vyavasthaatmak jokhim, jise bazaar jokhim yaa ashaakhneey jokhim bhi kaha jaataa he, tathaa avyavashthaatmak jokhim jise shaakhneey jokhim kaha jaataa he
 Systematic or market risk is due to the factors that affect all investment options, ie the entire market
 is prakaar ke jokhim par niyantran karnaa kathin he
 Disorganized risk is the risk that affects a particular security or investment option
 nivesh kaa vishaakhan karke aise jokhim ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context — ie its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness — as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance ie less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 siepiem maanata he ki kisi nivesh ke jokhim-pratifal anupaat ko durust kiya ja saktaa he, ek adarsh portpholio vah hoga jo ki ek nirdhaarit pratifal dar ke liye nunatam jokhim ke saath ho
 Additionally, as each new asset added to the portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above
 All such optimal portfolios, ie, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 An investor can also invest some part of his fund in risky assets and save some cash, which can be earned at a risk-free rate
 
 Here the ratio of risky and risk free does not determine the overall return - this relationship is definitely linear
 is prakaar se yah sambhav he ki nimna don main se kisi ek prakaar ek nishchit return praapt kiya ja saktaa he : However for a fixed return, only one of the above options would prove to be efficient
 chunki jokhimamukt sampatti paribhaashatah kisi bhi anya sampatti se correlated nahin he, dwitiya vikalp main saamanytah kam vichlan hoga jiske kaaran yah donon main se adhik kushal hoga
 This relationship would also hold true for other portfolios on the effective range: some cash with a higher return - is more efficient - rather than just a portfolio with lower returns at the same return rate
 ek nishchit jokhimamukt dar ke liye, ek hi kushal portpholio hoga jise ki nakadi ke saath milakar kisi bhi pratilabh ke liye nunatam jokhim kii sthiti praapt kii ja sakati he
 This is the market portfolio

 Jaitley recalled that Arun Jaitley, a minister in the Dinmodi government, was also a prisoner of MISA
 Recalling those days, Jaitley wrote, 'I had the distinction of organizing the only protest on the morning of 26 June 1975 and i became the first Satyagrahi against the Emergency
 i did not feel that at the age of 22 i was involved in the events that were going to be a part of history
 This incident changed the future of my life
 By evening, i was locked up as a MISA prisoner in Tihar Jail
 'with the imposition of the Emergency, a list of people who were to be arrested was made
 The first names in this list were Jayaprakash Narayan and Morarji Desai
 Indira's younger son Sanjay Gandhi was entrusted with the task of preparing this list
 JP and Morarji Desai were put in jail under MISA before dawn
 The story of Daman continued for the next 21 months
 The opposition prisoners who were ready in the jail did suffer torture in the jails but these prisoners also started to evict the Indira government from power
 From JP, leaders like Chandrashekhar, Vajpayee, George Fernandes, Lalu Yadav, LK Advani, Sharad Yadav ousted the Indira government from power as soon as they came out of jail
 The battle of opposition leaders reached a decisive point
 The Janata Party was formed under Morarji Desai and the first non-congress government was formed in 1977
 Indira herself lost the election to Rae Bareli and the Congress was reduced to 153 seats
 With the formation of the new government, the oppressive law MISA was removed
 Pension to MISA detainees Even during the Emergency, the government of non-congress states used to give pension to the people who were closed in MISA
 In Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, the BJP governments started giving pension of 15,000 rupees to prisoners held in DRI and MISA
 After this, in 2014, Vasundhara Raje government of Rajasthan also decided to give a pension of Rs 12 thousand per month to 800 MISA prisoners
 BJP still honors MISA prisoners throughout the country on the anniversary of the Emergency

 Pine trees are 10 to 80 meters tall

 lankacand valmiki krit ramayana or goswami tulsidas krit shri ram charit maanas kaa ek bhaag he
 By order of the brothers of apes Jambavan tap-nile bridge on the sea with the help of the army tied up
 shri ram ne shri rameshwar kii sthapana karke bhagwaan shankar kii puja kii or sena sahit samudr ke paar utar gayi
 Ram camped across the ocean
 pul bandha jane or ram ke samudr ke paar utar jane ke samachar se ravan man main atyant vyakul hua
 Ravana's arrogance did not go away even after Mandodari convinced him not to hate Rama
 idhar ram apni vanarasena ke saath subel parvat par nivas karne lage
 Angad went to Ravana in Lanka as Rama's messenger and gave him the message of Rama's asylum, but Ravana did not listen
 shanti ke saare prayaas asafal ho jane par yuddh armbh ho gaya
 a fierce battle ensued between Laxman and Meghnad
 shaktibaan ke waar se lakshmana moorchhit ho gayi
 Hanuman brought Sushen Vaidya for his treatment and went to bring Sanjeevani
 guptchar se samachar milane par ravan ne hanuman ke kaary main baadha ke liye kaalanemi ko bheja jiskaa hanuman ne vadh kar diya
 Due to lack of identification of the medicine, Hanuman lifted the whole mountain and went back
 maarg main hanuman ko rakshas hone ke sandeh main bharat ne baan maar kar moorchhit kar diya parantu yatharth jaanane par apane baan par bitha kar waapas lanka bhej diya
 Seeing the delay in the arrival of medicine, Ram began to bleed
 sahi samay par hanuman aushadhi lekar aa gayi or sushen ke upachaar se lakshmana swasth ho gayi
 Ravana woke Kumbhakarna to battle
 kumbhkarna ne bhi ram ke sharan main jane kii asafal mantranaa di
 In the war, Kumbhakarna attained supremacy at the hands of Rama
 lakshmana ne meghnad se yuddh karke uskaa vadh kar diya
 Many brutal wars took place between Ram and Ravan, and in the end, Ravan was killed by Ram
 vibhishana ko lanka kaa rajya saunp kar ram sita or lakshmana ke saath pushpakavimaan par chadh kar ayodhya ke liye prasthaan kiya
 The gorilla is the largest member of the human family
