 varun hindu dharm ke ek pramukh devtaa hai
 His place in the ancient Vedic religion was very important, but his form in the Vedas is so abstract that its natural depiction is difficult
 mana jaataa he ki varun kii sthiti anya vaidic devataaon kii apeksha pracheen he, isiilie vaidic yug main varun kisi prakritik upadan kaa vaachak nahin he
 The amount of hymns addressed to Varuna is much less than that of Agni and Indra, yet its importance is not less
 indra ko mahaan yoddha ke rup main janaa jaataa he to varun ko naitik shakti kaa mahaan poshak mana gaya he, vah rut kaa poshak he
 There is a feeling of sublime devotion towards Vasana in most of the Suktas

 Varuna is also described along with other deities such as Indra etc

 He was considered to have magical power, whose name was Maya

 In later mythology, Varuna was made a minor water god

 gine-chune deshon main hi sangeet kii itani puraani evam itani samrudh parampara paayi jaati he
 The music is believed to have originated during the Indus Valley Civilization, although the only evidence of this claim is the prevalence of a bronze idol and the worship of Rudra or Shiva, the god of dance, drama and music in the pose of a dancing bala of that time
 sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa ke patan ke pashchaat vaidic sangeet kii avasthaa kaa prarambh hua jisamen sangeet kii style main bhajanon or mantron ke uccharan se ishwar kii puja or archana kii jaati thi
 Apart from this, music was the main influence in the composition of two Indian epics - Ramayana and Mahabharata
 bharat main saanskrithik kaal se lekar aadhunik yug tak aate-aate sangeet kii style or paddati main jabardast parivartan hua he
 The great musicians of the history of Indian music such as Swami Haridas, Tansen, Amir Khusro, etc
 have contributed a lot to the advancement of Indian music, whose music is known to Pandit Ravi Shankar, Bhimsen Gururaj Joshi, Pandit Jasraj, Prabha Atre, Sultan Khan etc
 Has persisted even in today's era
 bhartiya sangeet main yah mana gaya he ki sangeet ke aadi prerak shiv or saraswati he
 This implies that human beings cannot develop such high art without any divine inspiration, only on their own strength
 vaidic yug main ‘sangeet’ samaaj main sthaan bana chukaa tha
 In the most ancient text, the Rigveda, music is the main instrument of the festival of Aryans
 anek vaadyon kaa avishkaar bhi rugveda ke samay main bataaya jaataa he
 In 'yajurveda', music was described as the means of livelihood of many people, then came the anthem Veda 'samaveda', which was considered to be the original text of the music
 ‘samaveda’ main uccharan kii drushti se teen or sangeet kii drushti se saat praakaar ke swaron kaa ullekh he
 The anthem of 'samaveda' closely resembled the religious music of Mesopotamia, Faldia, Akkad, Sumer, Bavaru, Asura, Sur, Jerusalem, Iran, Arabia, Finland and Egypt
 uttar vaidic kaal ke ‘ramayana’ granth main bheri, dundbhi, veena, mrudang va gadaa aadi vaadya yantron va bhanwaron ke gaan kaa varnan miltaa he, to ‘mahabharat’ main krishna kii baansuri ke jaadui prabhaav se sabhi prabhavit hote hai
 During the unknown, Arjuna took the form of Brihannala to teach Uttara the music and dance
 puranic kaal ke ‘taittiriya upanishad’, ‘aitarey upanishad’, ‘shatapath brahman’ ke alaava ‘yajyavlky-ratna pradipika’, ‘pratibhashyapradip’ or ‘naradiya shiksha’ jaise granthon se bhi hamen us samay ke sangeet kaa parichay miltaa he
 In the fourth century, Bharata Muni discussed music only in six chapters of 'natyashastra'
 inamen vibhinn vaadyon kaa varnan, unki utpatti, unhen bajaane ke tareekon, swar, chand, lay va vibhinn kaalon ke bare main vistaar se likhaa gaya he
 In this book, Bharata Muni has also written openly on the merits and demerits of singers and instrumentalists
 baad main chha: raag ‘bhairav’, ‘hindol’, ‘kaishik’, ‘deepak’, ‘shrirag’ or ‘medh’ prachaar main aaye
 The important text 'vrihadeshi' written by Matang Muni around the fifth century shows that by that time people had started to learn about ragas
 logon dwaara gaaye-bajaaye jane vaale raagon ko matang muni ne deshi raag kaha or deshi raagon ke niyamon ko samajhane hetu ‘vrihaddeshi’ granth kii rachana kii
 Matang was the first person who was able to think well that a raga cannot be made in less than four or five vowels
 panini ke ‘ashtaadhi’ main bhi anek vaadyon jaise mrudang, jharjhar, hudak tathaa gayakon va nartakon sambandhi kai baton kaa ullekh he
 In the seventh-eighth century, 'naradaiya Shiksha' and 'sangeet Makarand' were composed
 ‘sangeet makrand’ main raag main lagane vaale swaron ke anusaar unhen alag-alag virgon main baanta gaya he or raagon ko gane-bajaane ke samay par bhi gambheertha se sochaa gaya he
 Muslims brought Persian music with them in the eleventh century
 unki or hamaari sangeet paddatiyon ke mail se bhartiya sangeet main kaaphi badlaav aayaa
 The raja-maharaja of that era was also a lover of music and he helped other musicians to enhance and improve their art
 badshaah akbar ke darbar main 36 sangitajna the
 The names of Tansen, Baijubavra, Ramdas and Tanrang Khan of the same era are also known today
 jahangir ke darbar main khurramadad, makkhu, chhattar khan va vilaas khan naamak sangitajna the
 It is said that Shah Jahan himself used to sing well and used to give prizes to the singers by weighing them with gold and silver coins
 mughalavansh ke ek or badshaah mohammadshah rangile kaa naam to kai puraane geeton main aaj bhi miltaa he
 Raja Mansingh of Gwalior was also a music lover
 unke samay main hi sangeet kii khaas style ‘dhrupad’ kaa vikaas hua
 In the 12th century, the composer Jayadeva wrote a Sanskrit text called 'geetgovind', it is also known as Sakaran 'ashtapadi'
 terahavin shatabdi main pandit shorgadev ne ‘sangitaratnakar’ kii rachana kii
 In this book, a thorough study is found of the popular music of its era and the music of the time of Bharata and Matang
 saat adhyyon main rache hone ke kaaran is upyogi granth ko 'saptaadhyaayi' bhi kaha jaataa he
 In addition to 'sangeet Ratnakar' composed by Sharangdev, 'sangeet Saar' by Vidyaranya in the fourteenth century, 'rag Tarangini' by the Lochan poet in the fifteenth century, 'sadragchandrodaya' by Pundarik Vitthal in the sixteenth century, 'swarmail Kalanidhi' by Ramamatya, in the seventeenth century 'hriday Prakash' and 'hriday Kautukam' by Hridayanarayana Dev, 'chaturdardiprakashika' by Vyankatmakhi, by Ahobal ' 'geet Parijat', 'sangeet Darpan' by Damodar Pandit, 'anoop Vilas' and 'anoop Sangeet Ratnakar' by Bhavabhatta, 'ashtadhatarshatal Raksharam' by Somnath and 'raag Tatva Vibodh' by Srinivasa Pandit in the eighteenth century, 'sangeet Saramritam' by Tuljendra Bhonsle 'and' Raga Lakshman 'texts were composed
 swami haridas, vitthal, krishnadas, tyagaraj, muththuswami dikshitar or shyama shastri jaise anek sant kavi–sangitagnon ne bhi uttar aadi dakshin bharat ke sangeet ko anginat rachanaayen deen
 It can be said that Indian music is the result of centuries of effort and experimentation
 bhartiya sangeet kaa aadi rup vedon main miltaa he
 There is a lot of disagreement among scholars about the period of Vedas, but its period was about 2000 years before Christ - this is often agreed upon by all scholars
 isliye bhartiya sangeet kaa itihaas kam se kam 4000 varsh pracheen he
 In the Vedas, there are references to string instruments like Vana, Veena and Karkari
 avanaddh vaadyon main dudumbhi, gargar ityadi kaa, ghanvaadyon main aghat yaa aghati or sushir vaadyon main bakur, nadee, tunav, shankh ityadi kaa ullekh he
 The Yajurveda mentions several] choirs in the 19th and 20th mantras of the 30th scandal, which appears to have led to a variety of instrumental vocations by that time
 sansar bhar main sabase pracheen sangeet samaveda main miltaa he
 At that time "swara" was called "yama"
 sam kaa sangeet se itnaa ghanishtha sambandh tha ki sam ko swar kaa paryaay samajhane lag gaye the
 This is explained in the form of a question in the Chandogyopanishad
 "kaa samno gatiriti? swar iti hovach" 
 That is, one who knows the tone of the material gets "self"
 sam kaa "swa" swar hi he
 In Vedic times, the three-tone anthem was called 'samik'
 "samik" shabd se hi jaan padataa he ki pehle "sam" teen swaron se hi gaaya jaataa tha
 These vocals were "G re s"
 dhire-dhire gaan chaar, paanch, chah or saat swaron ke hone lage
 Very few parts of six and seven vowels are available
 adhik "sam" teen se paanch swaron tak ke milte hai
 The nouns of the Yama of Sama reveal the order of their attainment
 jaisaa ham kah chuke hai, samagayakon ko spasht rup se pehle "ga re sa" in teen yamon kii prapti hui
 They were named - First, Second, Third
 ye sab avarohi kram main the
 He got the eternal name, which was named as IV
 adhiktar sam inhen chaar swaron ke milte hai
 The names of these four vowels are in numerical words
 inke ananthar jo swar mili unke naam varnanaatmak shabdon dwaara vyakt kiye gaye hai
 This confirms the fantasy that they were received later
 "gandhar" se ek unche swar "madhyam" kii bhi prapti hui jiskaa naam "crusht" padaa
 When a downward vowel was received from Nishad, it was named "dim"
 jab isse bhi neeche ke ek or swar ko prapti hui to uskaa naam padaa "atiswar athwa atiswary"
 This means the last limit to remember
 sambhavya swaron ke niyat kram kaa jo samooh he vah sangeet main "sam" kehalaata he
 In European music it is called "scale"
 ham dekh sakate hai ki dhire-dhire viksit hokar sam kaa purna gram is prakaar bana- We have already said that the village of Sama was of descending order
 neeche ham samagram or unako aadhunik sangyaaon ko ek sarini main dete hai : There are usually seven parts of a communion - hunkar or hinkar, motion, etc

 Its main part is called Udgath
 ise udgaata gaata he
 There is a part of it which is called Pratihara
 ise pratiharta gaata he
 The part that comes after it is called a nuisance
 ise udgaata gaata he
 The demise or the final part of the triumph, presenter and retiree come together
 ant main sab ek saath milakar pranav arthath onkaar kaa saswar uccharan karte hai
 The Samagan has its own distinctive vocal
 logon main ek bhrant dharna he ki bhartiya sangeet main swarlipi nahin thi or yah europea sangeet kaa paridaan he
 All the Vedas have specific notes of sublime, anudatta and swarth for the recitation, but the rishis had prepared a complete lyric for the Samaveda's anthem
 sansar bhar main yah sabase puraani swarlipi taiyaar kar lee thi
 It is an old vowel in all of the world
 sumer ke gaan kii bhi kuch swarlipi yatratatra khudi hui milti he
 But he does not get any literature
 at: uske vishay main vishisht rup se kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa
 But all the mantras of the Sama are written in the form of the script, so they can be sung in the same form even today

 It contains and mentions the entire Shadva and Odava ragas and also describes Shrutis and seven vowels
 kalidas ke naatakon main sangeet kii charchaa itastat: ai he
 In Malavikagnimitra, the entire competition of two disciples in music is shown
 bhartiya sangeet kaa jo sabase pracheen granth miltaa he vah he bharat kaa naatyashaastra
 There is a dispute about the period of Bharata

 Therefore, it has become more difficult to decide its time

 Is kept at an interval of is prakaar shrutiyon kii kul sankhya 22 maani he
 Bharata considers two such villages as Shatjagram and Madhyamgram
 upar jo shrutiyon kaa antaraal diya he vah shadj gram kaa he
 It starts from the village plot
 isliye iskaa shadjagram naam padaa
 The name of the village which starts with medium is "medium Village"
 madhyam gram main madhyam chatu:shruti, pancham trishruti, dhaivat chatushruti, nishad dvishruti, shadj chatu:shruti, rishabh trishruti, evam gandhar dvishruti hota he
 Gandhara Gram Bharata is not valid
 moorchana kaa arth he ubhar yaa chamak
 The order of the seven vowels is the noun figurative
 bharat ne shadj or madhyam donon graamon main saat saat moorchanaayen maani hai
 Idols were the basis of the "caste" anthem
 vishisht swar vishesh prakaar ke sannivesh main "jati" kehalaate the
 In which the planets, nuggets, stars, circles, trusts, apnasas, minorities, plurality, Shadvatva and Auduvattva were coined by the laws of law, it was called "caste"
 jatigaan sangeet kii bahut viksit avasthaa kaa suchak he

 In Kudumiyamalai place of Tamil Nadu an inscribed article has been found which is probably of 7th century CE
 isamen saat jatiyon, saat swaron or kuch shrutiyon kaa tathaa antar gandhar or kakali nishad kaa ullekh he
 This proves that by the seventh century in India, music had advanced enough and its main themes had become famous and acceptable from north to south
 kuch log naradiya shiksha ko bhi 7veen shatee ke aasapaas kaa granth maanate hai
 Seeing this scripture shows that it is more ancient than Bharata's Natyashastra

 Vedic music is not mentioned in the Natyasastra

 Ptolemy, the Greek geographer, referred to Palur as the port Paloura, located close to the point of departure located outside the southern tip of the lake at Kantiagarh, from where ships bound for different parts of Southeast Asia sailed
 After 639, the Chinese pilgrims fa-hien and hiuen-tsang mention a famous port "che-li-ta-loching" near the shore of the ocean which was a thoroughfare and resting place for seagoing traders and strangers from distant lands
 This port was located at 'chhatragarh' on the banks of Chilika Lake
 a fourth century legend, often told to explain the birth of Chilika, states that the pirate king, Raktabahhu, planned to attack Puri with a huge fleet of ships
 To avoid detection, he stealthily anchored out of sight, off the mouth to the sea
 The deception was revealed by ships' refuse floating to the shore, thus warning the town’s people, who escaped with all their possessions
 Raktabahu felt betrayed when he found an abandoned town and directed his fury towards the seathat had betrayed him
 The sea parted to let the army march in, then surged back, drowned the army and formed the present lake
 Archeological excavations discovered Seventh century ship anchors and stone memoirs dedicated to battle heroes at a village named Kanas, about 25 km north of Chilika on the banks of Nuna river, which flows into the lake
 This gives evidence of an historic naval engagement off the coast
 a 10th-century text, the Brahmanda Purana, mentions Chilika Lake as an important centre of trade and commerce, and a shelter for ships sailing to Java, Malaya, Singhala, China and other countries
 This suggests that the lake was then deep enough for berthing seagoing ships and had a channel to the sea big enough for loaded trading ships embarking to Southeast Asia
 The villagers around Chilika Lake still observe an annual festival called "bali Yatra" 
 In 1803, the British entered the shores of the lake, reached Puri and occupied Odisha with the help of Fateh Muhammed

 The three hydrological sub-systems control the hydrology of the lake
 The land based system comprises distributaries of the Mahanadi River on the northern side, 52 river channels from the western side and the Bay of Bengal on the eastern side
 Two of the three southern branches of the Mahanadi River that trifurcates at Cuttack,feed the lake
 61% ) of the total fresh water inflow into the lake is contributed by these two branches
 The second drainage system which is non – perennial accounts for 39%)
 The important rivers of this drainage system are the Kansari, the Kusumi, the Janjira and the Tarimi rivers
 The annual total surface freshwater input to the lake is estimated to 1
76 cubic meters including direct precipitation over the lake about 0
87 cubic meters All the inland river systems disgorge an annual flow of about 0
375 million cubic meters of freshwater which is estimated to carry 13 million metric tons of silt into the lake
 On the north east a channel connects the lake to the Bay of Bengal
 a tropical monsoon climate prevails over the drainage basin area of the lake
 The lake experiences South–west and North-east monsoons during June to September and November to December respectively with average annual rainfall of 1,238
8 mimi, with 72 rainy days
 The maximum temperature of 39
9 °se
 and minimum temperature of 14 °se
 have been recorded
 The wind speed varies from 5
3 se 16 meter / hour with southerly and southwesterly direction due to the influence of the South–west monsoon and from north and north easterly direction during the rest of the months

 Concerted action was initiated by the Odisha State Government with support from the Government of India to adopt adaptive conservation and management actions
 By 1993, the problems in Chilika were so severe that the lake was put under "the Montreux Record" as the lake was considered to have “undergone, to be undergoing, or to be likely to undergo change in its ecological character brought about by human action”
 The purpose was to stimulate remedial measures for the lake's conservation, supplemented with adequate monitoring
 It was expected that such an action would benefit from the advice from Ramsar Advisory Mission and other identified technical assistance programmes
 In summary, upstream silt led to a serious negative impact on habitat for wildlife and fishery resources, all of which led to shrinkage of the water surface area, salinity and lack of prolific growth of invasive freshwater aquatic weeds
 In 1992, the Government of Odisha, concerned by the degradation of the lake's ecosystem and cognizant of significant numbers of people who were dependent upon the lake's resources, set up the Chilika Development Authority 
 The CDA was set up for restoration and overall development of the lake under the Indian Societies Registration Act as a parastatal body under the administrative jurisdiction of the Forest and Environment Department, with the following charter: The governing body of the authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Odisha State and has people's representatives, representatives of the fisherfolk communities and secretaries of the key departments, experts and eminent scientists as its members
 In 1998, an executive committee constituted with financial authority, supplemented with financial support from the Tenth and Eleventh Finance Commissions of the bharat sarkaar, gave support to the management initiatives taken up by CDA
 This facilitated a coordinated approach to plan and implement effective ameliorative management actions
 An Integrated Management Plan was implemented with financial support of Rs 570 million out of "special problem grants" recommended by the Finance Commissions
 Hydrobiological monitoring was supported under the Odisha Water Resources Consolidation Project of the World Bank, to the extent of Rs 10 million
 a strong support network was created with 7 state government organizations, 33 ngos, 3 national government ministries, 6 other organizations, 11 international organizations, 13 research institutions and 55 different categories of community groups
 In 2003, collaboration of Indian and Japanese experts led to a friendly relationship between Chilika lake and Saroma Lake in Japan called Sister Wetlands
 Considering the threats faced by the lake, the National Wetlands, Mangroves and Coral Reefs Committee of the Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India, also identified the lake as a priority site for conservation and management
 The ameliorative actions taken by the CDA to restore the ecosystem and to improve the socio-economic conditions of the communities living around the lake and on its islands involved the following
 The most effective ameliorative action was the hydrological intervention of opening the new lake mouth and channel to the sea through the barrier beach at Satapura
 This improved the spatial and temporal salinity gradients of the lake to maintain the unique characteristics of an estuarine eco-system
 This intervention was undertaken after detailed scientific studies, including 3-dimensional mathematical modeling and hydraulics studies on a model prototype, were carried out by the Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune and National Institute of Oceanography, Goa
 In September 2000, the desiltation of the channel connecting the lake to the sea and opening of a new mouth to restore the natural flows of water and salinity levels was carried out
 These actions resulted in a notable increase in the lake's fish yield and a reduction of freshwater weeds
 The new mouth reduced the length of the outflow channel by 18 kilometre 
 Opening of the new mouth provided a favorable increased salinity regime throughout the lake with less fluctuations and improved water clarity
 detailed results of this action can be seen in the references cited in External sources
 Other measures included: In 2002, Chilika was taken out of the Montreux Record, in light of the improved conditions of the lake
 Chilika lake is the first Ramsar site in Asia to beremoved from the Montreux record
 The ecological richness of the lake is of great value in increasing the genetic diversity because of the multiplicity of its habitat, flora and fauna
 
 The Zoological Survey of India surveyed the lake between 1985 and 1988 and identified 800 species of fauna, including many rare, endangered, threatened and vulnerable species, but excluding terrestrial insects
 The rare and threatened animal species identified are green sea turtle, dugong, Irrawaddy dolphin, blackbuck, Spoon billed sandpiper, limbless skink and fishing cat 
 24 mammalian species were reported
 37 species of reptiles and amphibians are also reported
 Recent surveys revealed an overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families
 This represents about one – fourth of the vascular plant species of the Odisha state where some 2900 species altogether are found
 Fabaceae is the most dominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 Certain species were found to be characteristic of specific islands
the flora is predominantly of aquatic and sub-aquatic plants
 Overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families have been recorded
 Fabaceae is the predominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 The species reported are leguminosae, poaceae, and cyperaceae; endemic cassipourea ceylanica; five species of seagrass, and more
important species are identified:
 Chilika Lake is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds, on the Indian sub-continent
 It is one of the hotspots of biodiversity in the country
 Some species listed in the IUCN Red List of threatened animals inhabit the lake for at least part of their life cycle
 White bellied sea eagles, greylag geese, purple moorhen, jacana, flamingos, egrets, gray and purple herons, india n roller, storks, white ibis, spoonbills, brahminy ducks, shovellers, pintails, and more
 Migratory water fowl arrive here from as far as the Caspian Sea, Baikal Lake and remote parts of Russia, Mongolia, Lakah, Siberia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and from the Himalayas
 a census conducted in the winter of 1997-98 recorded about 2 million birds in the lake
 In 2007, nearly 840,000 birds visited the lake, out of which 198,000 were seen in Nalbana Island
 On 5 Jan 2008, a bird census involving 85 wildlife officers counted 900,000 birds of which 450,000 were sighted in Nalabana
 Removal of invasive species of freshwater aquatic plants, especially water hyacinth, due to restoration of salinity, is a contributing factor for the recent increasing attraction of birds to the lake
 Nalbana Island is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands of Chilika Lake
 Nalbana means a weed covered island In the Odia language
 It is a major island in the center of the lake and has an area of 15
53 kimi2 
 The island gets completely submerged during the monsoon season
 As the monsoon recedes in the winter, lake levels decrease and the island is gradually exposed, birds flock to the island in large numbers to feed on its extensive mudflats
 Nalbana was notified in 1987 and declared a bird sanctuary in 1973 under the Wildlife Protection Act
 As per the Chilika Development Authority's updated data, 323 aquatic species, which includes 261 fish species, 28 prawns and 34 crabs are reported out of which sixty five species breed in the lake
 27 species are freshwater fishes and two genera of prawns
 The remaining species migrate to the sea to breed
 21 species of herrings and sardines of the family Clupeidae are reported
 Between 1998–2002, 40 fish species were recorded here for the first time and following the reopening of the lake mouth in 2000, six threatened species have reappeared, including: For centuries fisher folk developed exclusive rights of fishing through a complex system of partitioning the fisheries of the lake, harvested the lake in a relatively sustainable fashion and developed a large range of fishing techniques, nets and gear
 During the British rule, in 1897–98, fishermen community enjoyed exclusive fisheries rights in the lake
 The fisheries of the lake were part of the Zamindari estates of Khallikote, Parikud, Suna Bibi, Mirza Taher Baig and the Chaudhary families of Bhungarpur and the Khas mahal areas of Khurda, lying within the kingdoms of the Rajas of Parikud and Khallikote
 The zamindars leased out the fisheries exclusively to the local fisherfolk
 With the abolition of zamindari system in 1953, traditional fishing areas continued to be leased out to cooperatives of local fishermen
 Fishing, particularly, prawn fishing, became increasingly remunerative with outside interest playing an important role
 But in 1991, when the government of Odisha proposed a leasing policy that would have resulted in the auction of leases to the highest bidder, the Fishermen's cooperatives challenged the order in court
 The High Court of Odisha ordered the Government to enact changes that would protect the interests of traditional fishermen and since then no new leases have been reported
 This has resulted in a chaotic regime in which powerful vested interests from outside dominate, and the local people have been subordinated
 Butter catfish and Wallago attu are the most common type of fish found in the lake
 11 species of fish, 5 species of prawn and 2 crab species are commercially important
 The commercially important prawn are giant tiger prawn, Indian prawn, Metapenaeus monoceros, Metapenaeus affinis and Metapenaeus dobson 
 Mangrove crab is the most important commercial crab
 Fish landings in the lake, which fluctuated in the past, have recorded a remarkable recovery after the opening of the new mouth and dredging of silt –choked old mouth Magarmukh in 2000–2001, resulted in a better intermixing of the tidal influx from the sea and freshwater inflow from rivers
 Against an all time lowest landing of fish and prawn of 1,269 dravyaman in 1995–96, the all-time high is reported to be 11,878 dravyaman during 2001–2002 resulting in an estimated per capita income for the fisher folk of Rs 19,575 during the year
 Recently, the Government of Odisha have issued a notification banning the lease of Chilika Lake for Culture Fishery
 The Irrawaddy dolphin is the flagship species of Chilika lake
 Chilka is home to the only known population of Irrawaddy dolphins in India and one of only two lagoons in the world that are home to this species
it is classified as critically endangered, in five of the six other places it is known to live
 a small population of Bottlenose dolphins, also migrate into the lagoon from the sea
 Chilika fishermen say that when Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return toward the lake
 Some Irrawaddy dolphins used to be sighted only along the inlet channel and in a limited portion of the central sector of the lake
 After the opening of the new mouth at Satapada in 2000, they are now well distributed in the central and the southern sector of the lake
 The number of dolphins sighted has varied from 50 to 170
 a 2006 census counted 131 dolphins and the 2007 census revealed 138 dolphins
 Out of the 138 dolphins, 115 were adults, 17 adolescents and six calves
 60 adults were seen in the outer channel followed by 32 in the central sector and 23 in the southern sector
 Dolphin tourism provides an important alternative source of income for many local residents
 There are four tourist associations in Satapada employing three hundred and sixty 9-HP long-tail motor boats taking tourists to a 25 kimi2 area of the lake for dolphin watching
 About 500 fishing families are involved in this business
 The Odisha Tourism Department and the Dolphin Motorboat Association, an NGO at Satpada, report about 40,000 tourists visit Chilika every year for dolphin Watching
 october–january and may–june are the peak season for tourists at Chilika, with a maximum 600-700 per day during december–january
 The Dolphin Motorboat Association has 75 8-passenger motorboats for dolphin watching
 Tourists pay Rs
 250 for 60–90 minutes per trip
 According to the Association, most tourists see dolphins
 Only 5% return disappointed
 Besides the Association, the Odisha Tourism Department organises "dolphin-watch" for tourists
 Even during monsoon, about 100 tourists / day visit the lake
 Boat based dolphin watching tours impact dolphin behavior and cause several accidental dolphin deaths each year
 CDA conducts an annual census of dolphin deaths
 They report 15 deaths in 2003-04, 11 in 2004-05, 8 in 2005-06 and 5 in 2006-07
 40% of the 2006-07 deaths were by mechanized boats
 Since 2004, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been conducting a science based community education project to conserve the Irrawaddy dolphins and Chilika Lake
 They have determined the primary cause of mortality for this population of dolphins is floating gill nets and hook line fisheries and the secondary cause is boat strikes from increasing unmanaged tourism activities
 The Irrawaddy dolphins have a seemingly mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with the traditional fishermen
 Fishermen recall when they would call out to the dolphins, to drive fish into their nets
 Castnet fishing with the help of Irrawaddy dolphins in upper reaches of the Ayeyawady River has been well documented
 Nalaban Island: The 15 km2 Nalaban Island is within the Lagoon and is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands
 It was declared a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act in 1973
 It’s the heart of the park where one can seen thousands of birds descending during the migratory season
 The island disappears during monsoon season due to inundation, and post-monsoon, the island emerges again
 The vast lake harbors 225 species of fish, a wide variety of phytoplankton, algae and aquatic plants, and also supports over 350 species of non-aquatic plants
 The other areas where high concentrations of birds are recorded are Gerasara, Parikud Island, and the western shores of the Northern sector
 Chilka Lake is one of the best bird watching spots in India, and is also popular for fishing and angling
 Puri: This holy city is famous for the late 11th century built Jagannath temple
 The other major attraction here is the beach, from where you can witness the glorious sunrise and equally mesmerizing sunset
 It's said that a visit to Puri is incomplete without visiting Chilika Lagoon
 The Nirmaljhara Waterfall: This is an ideal place for pitching your picnic tent
 The beautiful waterfall is located nearly 12 km from Chilika Lagoon
 Satpada: This place is located at a distance of around 55 km from Puri, on the eastern side of the Chilika Lake
 This place is surrounded by lagoons from the three sides, which makes this place an amazing tourist spot for nature lover
 The open air and scenic natural flora and fauna of the lake are an attraction for eco-tourism
 This is expected to provide a degree of alternate employment to the local community and generate environmental awareness, among local residents as well as visitors, about the conservation and wise use of the lake’s natural resources
 The locations within the lake identified for such activity are: The lake is well connected by road to Chennai and Kolkata via National Highway No 5
 Satpara town on the eastern bank of the lake is about 50 km by road southwest of the city of Puri and at a distance of 100 km ॰ from Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, which is also the nearest airport
 a broad gauge railway line of the South Eastern Railway from Kolkata skirts along the western bank of the lake passing through Balugaon, Chilika and Rambha stations
 Within the lake precincts, Odisha Tourism Development Corporation Ltd and the Revenue Department of the state government offer boat cruises
 Private operators also provide country boats on hire to various islands in the lake
 There are OTDC Guest houses at Barkul, Rambha, Satapada & several hotels at Balugaon
 Before entering into the Nalbana Bird Sanctuary one has to obtain an entry permit
 The entry permit has to be produced at entry / exit points, at check gates as and whenever requested by officials

 Without seismic data or inertial information, little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus
 shukr or prithvi ke bich aakaar or ghanatv main samanta bataati he, wein samaan aantarik sanrachana saajha karti he: ek kor, ek mental or ek crust
 Like on Earth, Venus' core is at least partially liquid because the cooling rate of these two planets has been almost the same
 shukr kaa thodaa chota aakaar bataata he, iske gahare aantarik bhaag main dabaav prithvi se kaaphi kam hai
 The major difference between these two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong for underwater abduction to make it less viscous
 iske parinamswaroop grah se garmi kii kami kam ho jaati he, ise thanda karne se rokatii he or aantarik rup se jenerate kiye gaye chumbakeey kshetra kii kami ke liye sambhavit spashtikaran pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Despite this, Venus may lose its internal heat intermittently in major restructuring events
 shukr kaa vayumandal atyant ghanaa he, jo mukhya rup se carbon dioxide or nitrogen kii ek choti maatra se milakar bana he
 The atmospheric mass is 93 times that of the Earth's atmosphere, while the pressure on the planet's surface is 92 times that of the Earth's surface pressure - this pressure is equal to the pressure of a kilometer close to the Earth's oceans

 This makes the surface of Venus more hot than Mercury
 budh kaa nunatam satahi taapmaana −220 °C or adhiktam satahi taapmaana 420 °C he
 Mercury receives only 25% of solar radiation, despite the planet Venus being twice as close to the Sun
 praayah shukr kii sataha naarkeey rup main varnit he
 This temperature is also higher than the temperature used to achieve sterilization
 adhyayanon ne bataaya he ki shukr kaa vaataavaran haal kii tulana main arabon saal pehle prithvi kii tarah bahut zyada tha or vahaan sataha par taral pani kii paryaapt maatra rahi ho sakati he
 However, after a period ranging from 60 million to several billion years, the evaporation of the original water caused a runaway greenhouse effect, which produced a significant level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere there
 However, the superficial situation on the planet is not a long guest for any earth-like life, which may have been before this event
 yah sambhaavna ki ek rahane yogya duusari jagah nichle or madhyam badal paraton main maujud he, shukr ab bhi daud se baahar nahin hua he
 Thermal inertia and heat transfer by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that Venus's surface temperature does not vary significantly between night and day sides, despite that the planet's rotation is extremely slow
 sataha par hawaaen dhimi hai, prati ghante kuch hi kilometre kii duuri chalati he, lekin shukr ke sataha par vaataavaran ke ucch ghanatv kii vajah se, ve avarodhon ke khilaaf ullekhneey maatra kaa bal daalati he or sataha bhar main dhul or chote pattharon kaa parivahan karti he
 This alone would have made it difficult for the human to walk, otherwise heat, pressure and lack of oxygen were not a problem
 saghan CO2 parat ke upar ghaney badal hai jo mukhya rup se sulfur dioxide or salphurik amla kii buundon se milakar bane he
 These clouds reflect and disperse about 90% of the sunlight that falls back on them in space and prevent visual observation of Venus's surface
 badalon ke sthaayee aavaran kaa arth he ki bhale hi shukr grah prithvi kii tulana main surya se najadik he, par shukr kii sataha acchhee tarah se tapi nahin he
 The powerful winds of 300 km / h at the top of the clouds revolve around the planet every four to five Earth days
 shukr kii hawaaen uski ghurnan ke 60 gune tak gatisheel he, jabaki prithvi kii sabase tej hawaaen ghurnan gati kii keval 10% se 20% hai
 The surface of Venus is effectively isothermal, maintaining a constant temperature not only between day and night but also between the equator and the poles
 grah kaa alp aksheeya jhukaav bhi mausami taapmaana vividhta ko kam karata he
 Significant variation in temperature is found only with altitude

 In 2007, the Venus Express probe discovered that a massive double atmospheric vortex exists at the south pole of the planet
 2011 main venus express prob dwaara ek anya khoj kii gai or vah he, shukr ke vaataavaran kii oonchai main ek ozon parat maujuud he
 On 29 January 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of the planet Venus flows outward, which is similar in the sense that "a comet was observed to be bombarded by a comet under similar conditions"
 " In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus' magnetic field much weaker than that of Earth
 yah chumbakeey kshetra ek aantarik dynamo, prithvi ke andruni kor kii tarah, kii bajaay inmandal or saura vaayu ke bich ek antahkriya dwaara prerit he
 The small induced magnetic field of Venus gives the atmosphere negligible protection against cosmic radiation
 yah vikiran badal dar badal bijli nirvahan kaa parinaam ho saktaa he
 Despite the Earth being equal in size, the lack of an internal magnetic field on Venus was surprising
 It was also expected that its core holds a dynamo
 ek dynamo ko teen chizon kii zarurat hoti he: ek suchalak taral, ghurnan or sanvahan
 The core is thought to be electrically conductive, while its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show that this is sufficient for a dynamo formation
 iskaa taatpary he, dynamo gum he kyonki shukr ke kor main sanvahan kii kami he
 On Earth, convection occurs in the outer layer of the core because the bottom liquid layer is much hotter than the top
 shukr par, ek vaishvik punarsatahikaran ghatana ne plate vivartaniki ko band kar diya ho saktaa he or yah bhupatal se hokar ushma pravaah ke ghataav kaa kaaran bana
 This caused the mantle temperature to rise, leading to increased heat flow outside the core
 natijatan, ek chumbakeey kshetra chalaane ke liye koi aantarik bhudinamo uplabdh nahin he
 Instead, the thermal energy released from the core is used again and again to reheat the crust
 ek sambhaavna yah ki shukr kaa koi thos bhitari kor nahin he, yaa iskaa kor vartmaan main thanda nahin he, isliye kor kaa puraa taral hissaa lagbhag ek hi taapmaana par he
 Another possibility is that its core is already completely frozen
 kor kii avasthaa gandhak ke sandran par atyadhik nirbhar he, jo philhal agyaat he
 The weak magnetic casing around Venus means the solar wind makes direct contact with the planet's outer atmosphere
 yahaan, hydrogen va oxigen ke aayan parabangnee vikiran se nikle tatasth anuon ke viyojan dwaara banaaye gayi he
 The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to drain from the planet's magnetic field

 Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0
72 AU and completes one round every 224
65 days

 When Venus lies between the planet Earth and the Sun, this position is called inferior conjunction, which makes its reach closest to the Earth, the other planets being at an average distance of 4
1 crores
 shukr ausatan har 584 dinon main avar sangyojan par pahunchataa he
 Due to the decreasing eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, this minimum distance will be maximum after tens of thousands of years

 Most planets also rotate in an anti-clockwise direction on their axis, but Venus rotates counterclockwise once every 243 Earth days, which is the slowest rotation period of any planet
 is prakaar ek shukr nakshatra diwas ek shukr varsh se lambey samay tak rahata he
 The equator of Venus rotates at a speed of 6

 Due to retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is much shorter than that of its sidereal day, which is 116
75 Earth days

 For an observer from the land of Venus, the sun will rise in the west and set in the east
 shukr grah, vibhinn ghurnan avadhi or jhukaav ke saath ek saura niharika se gathit hua ho saktaa he
 Due to tidal effects on dense atmospheres and disturbed rotational shifts induced by planetary ejection, it has reached its present position
 yah badlaav jo ki arabon varshon kii kriyavidhi uparaant ghatit hua hoga
 The rotation period of Venus probably represents a state of equilibrium that forms between the tidal tightness of the Sun's gravity that tends to slow rotation and an atmospheric tide created by the solar heating of the dense Venus atmosphere

 However, the hypothesis of a rotating-orbital resonance with the Earth has been missed
 shukr kaa koi prakritik upgrah nahin he, haalanki kshudragrah 2002 VE68 vartmaan main iske saath ek ardh kakshiya sambandh rakhata he
 Apart from this quasi satellite, it has two other floating co-orbital 2001 CK32 and 2012 XE33

 At the California Institute of Technology, 2006 studies by Alex Almy and David Stevenson on former solar systems show that Venus had at least one moon like ours that was created by a major collision event Arbo years ago
 adhyayan ke mutabik kareeb ek karod saal baad ek anya takkar ne grah kii ghurnan disha ulat di
 This caused the rotation or orbit of the Moon of Venus to slowly shrink inward until it collided with Venus and merged into it
 yadi baad kii takkaron ne chandramaa banaaye he to wein bhi usee tarah se khinch liye gaye
 An alternative explanation for the absence of satellites is the effect of powerful solar tides that can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets

 Venus crosses the Earth every 584 days, orbiting the Sun
 jaisaa ki yah dikhaai detaa he, yah suryaast ke baad "sanjh kaa tara" se lekar suryoday se pehle "bhor kaa tara" tak badal jaataa he
 The inflection of Mercury, another inferior planet, reaches a maximum of only 28 ° and is often barely recognized in the twilight, while Venus is difficult to miss at its maximum radiance
 iske adhik se adhik adhiktam prasarkon kaa matlab he yah suryaast ke ekadam baad tak andhere aasmaan main najar aata he
 There is a simple misrepresentation of Venus as an "unknown flying table" as a bright point in the sky

 As Venus revolves around its orbit, in telescopic scenery it exhibits arts like the moon: in the arts of Venus, the planet presents a small "full" image when it is in the opposite direction to the Sun
 , When it is at the maximum angle from the Sun, exhibits a large "quartz art", and the night is at its maximum brightness in the sky, and as it moves between the Earth and the Sun
 Eepsth presents comes somewhere around the telescope a huge "skinny crescent" in the scenery
 shukr jab prithvi or surya ke bichobich hota he, apane sabase bade aakaar par hota he or apni "nav kala" prastut karata he
 Its atmosphere can be seen in a telescope by the aura of refracted light around the planet

 Transit Venus is found when the planet's inferior conjunction coincides with the presence in the Earth's orbital plane
 shukr ke pargaman 243 saal ke chakron main hote hai
 In the current mode of transit, the first two transits take place at an interval of eight years, then a longer break of about 105
5 years or 121
5 years, and again at the beginning of the new transit pair of eight-year intervals

 The so-called Bhasmavarna Prakash is a mystery of long-standing Venus observations
 bhasmavarn prakaash shukr ke andhkaar paksh kii ek sukshma roshni he or najar aati he jab grah arddh chandrakaar charan main hota he
 The first claim to see this light was made long back in 1643, but the existence of the light could never be reliably confirmed

 This may be the result of the illusion of seeing a bright, crescent shaped object
 shukr grah ko "subah ke taare" or "shaam ke taare" donon hi roopon main pracheen sabhyataaon ne jaan liya tha
 Before the name itself, it is clear that they were two different things
 Ammisaduka's Venus table, dated 1581 BCE, shows the Greek understanding that the two objects were the same
 is patalika main shukr ko "akaash kii ujjwal rani" ke rup main nirdisht kiya gaya he or vistrut prekshanon ke saath is drushtikon kaa samarthan kiya ja sakaa he
 By the time of Pythagoras in the sixth century BCE, the Greeks had the concept of two different stars as Phosphorus and Hesperus

 Schröter found that when the planet was a thin crescent, the bowl extended more than 180 °
 unhone sahi anumaan lagaaya ki yah ghaney vaataavaran main surya prakaash ke bikharane kii vajah se tha
 Later, when the planet was in inferior conjunction, American astronomer Chester Smith Leaman observed a full ring around its dark side and provided evidence for the atmosphere
 The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schröter incorrectly estimated periods of about 24 hours from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface
 By the 20th century, there was a lot more discovery about Venus
 isaki kareeb-kareeb akritiheen disk ne koi suraag nahin diya ki isaki sataha aakhir kis tarah kii ho sakati he
 More of its mysteries occurred with the development of exposure, spectroscopy, radar, and ultraviolet observations

 For Venus, like any other planet, the first robotic spacecraft mission began on 12 February 1961 with the launch of the Venera 1 probe
 soviet venera kaarykram antargat yah pehla yaan tha
 Venera 1 lost contact on the seventh day of the mission, when it was 20 million km from Earth

 The Soviet Venera 3 vehicle crashed while landing on Venus on 1 March 1966
 It was the first man-made object to enter the atmosphere and hit the surface of another planet
 Even though its communication system failed, before that it was able to transmit all planetary data
 On 18 October 1967, Venera 4 successfully entered the atmosphere and deployed many scientific instruments
 Venera 4 reported the surface temperature to be about 5000 c higher than that measured by Mariner 2, and showed the atmosphere to be about 90 to 95% carbon dioxide
 Venus's atmosphere was quite dense compared to the estimates made by the creators of Venera 4
 This made the parachute slower than the scheduled landing time
 This meant the battery of the vehicle slowed down before reaching the surface
 After transmitting data up to 93 minutes, 24

 The Government of India announced the Indian Forest Ordinance, 2017 to encourage bamboo cultivation in non-forest areas whose bamboo grown in non-forest areas is exempted from being brought under the definition of tree and thus its economic use To be exempted from the requirement of cutting / transit permits
 bans, haalanki ghaas kii paribhaasha ke tahat aata he par ise bhartiya van adhinium, 1927 kanoonee rup se ek vriksh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 Prior to this amendment, the provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 applied to the cutting / transit of bamboo grown on any forest and non-forest land
 kisaanon dwaara gaiyr van bhoomi par bans kii kheti karne kii raah main yah ek badi baadha thi
 One of the major objectives of this amendment was to encourage bamboo cultivation in non-forest areas to achieve the dual goal of increasing the income of farmers and increasing green area of the country
 van kshetron main ugaae gaye bans abhi bhi bhartiya van adhinium, 1927 ke praavdhaanon dwaara shasit honge
 These steps, in particular, will play an important role in increasing agricultural income for farmers and tribal people of North East India and Central India

 sandhivaarta us baatcheet ko kehete hai jiskaa uddeshy vivaadon ko hal karnaa, vibhinn kriyaaon kii disha par sahmati paidaa karnaa, kisi ek vyakti athwa samuhik laabh ke liye sauda karnaa, yaa vibhinn hiton ko tusht karne ke liye parinaamon ko tarashna he
 This is the primary method of alternative dispute resolution
 samjhauta vaarta, vyapaar, labharahit sanghathanon, sarkari shakhaon, kanoonee kaarywahiyon, deshon ke bich or vyaktigat paristhitiyon jaise vivaah, talaak, bacchon kii parvarish or rosemara kii jindagi main hoti hai
 The study of this subject is called the principle of negotiation
 peshewar vaartakar aksar visheshgy hote hai, jaise ki sangh ke vaartakar, uttolan kharid vaartakar, shanti vaartakar, bandhak vaartakar, yaa ve anya kisi padnaam ke antargat bhi kaam kar sakate hai, jaise rajanyik, vidhayak yaa dalal
 The English word "negociation" is derived from the Latin expression, "negotiatus", which is the past participle of negotiare meaning "to carry on the business"
 "negotium" literally means "no leisure"
 samjhauta vaarta, aam taur par ek vishesh sanghathan yaa sthiti kii ore se kaary kar rahe prashikshit vaartakar ke saath khud ko prakat karti he
 This can be compared with arbitration where a neutral third party listens to the arguments of both parties and tries to help in reaching an agreement between the two parties
 iskaa sambandh panchayat se bhi he, jaisaa ki ek kanoonee kaarywahi main hota he, donon paksh apane "maamle" ke gunon ke liye tark rakhte hai or uske baad ek panch donon dalon ke liye parinaam kaa faisla karata he
 In order to develop a better understanding of the essential parts of the negotiation, there are several different ways to divide it
 samjhauta vaarta ke ek nazariye main teen buniyadi tatva shaamil hai: prakriya, vyavhaar or padaarth 
 prakriya kaa sandarbh is baat se he ki dal kaise samjhauta vaarta karte hai: vaartaon kaa prasang, vaartaon main dal, dalon dwaara prayukt ranneeti or anukram or charan jinamein ye sabhi faleebhoot honge
 vyavhaar, in dalon ke bich sambandhon, unke bich samvaad or unke dwaara apanaai jane vaali shaileyon ko darshata he
 Substance refers to what these parties negotiate for: the agenda, the issues, the options, and the agreement that is finally reached
 samjhauta vaarta ke ek anya nazariye main 4 tatva shaamil hai: ranneeti, prakriya or upkaran or yukti 
 ranneeti main sheersh str ke lakshya shaamil hote hai - aam taur par jisamen shaamil hote hai rishte or antim parinaam
 prakriyaaon or upkarnon main shaamil hai uthaae jane vaale kadam or duusare dalon ke saath vaarta kii taiyaari or vaarta ke dauraan, donon main apanaai jane vaali bhoomikaayen
 yukti main shaamil hai adhik vistrut bayaan or kaary or dusron ke bayanon or karrwai ke liye di gai pratikriyaayein
 kuch log isamen anunay or prabhaav ko jodate hai, unka kahana he ki aadhunik samay kii samjhauta vaarta kii safalataa ke liye ye abhinn ban gaye hai or isliye inhen choda nahin janaa chahie
 Skilled negotiators can use a wide variety of tactics, the wide range of which can range from negotiation hypnosis to presenting demands in a straight-forward manner or under a more deceptive approach, such as cherry picking, setting the preconditions
 
 samjhauta vaarta ke parinaamon ko modane main, dhamkee or salaami yukti bhi ek bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 Another compromise negotiation tactic is the bad guy / good guy
 bura aadmi / acha aadmi yukti tab hoti he, jab ek vaartakar bure aadmi ke rup main gusse or dhamkee kaa upyog karata he
 The second negotiator acts like a good man, thoughtful and sensible
 acha aadmi, apane virdohi se riyaayat or samjhauta paane kii koshish main bure aadmi ko har kathinaaiyon ke liye dosha detaa he
 In the advocacy approach, a skilled negotiator typically acts as a party advocate in settlement negotiations and seeks to achieve the most favorable possible outcomes for that party
 is prakriya main vaartakar, us nunatam parinaam ko nirdhaarit karne kaa prayaas karata he jise doosraa dal sweekaar karne ko taiyaar he or phir unki maangon ko tadnusaar samyojit karata he
 In the advocacy approach, a successful settlement negotiation is considered when the negotiator is able to achieve all or most of the outcomes desired by the unanimous party, without provoking the other party to break up the settlement negotiations, as long as the negotiation The best option may not be acceptable
 paaramparik samjhauta vaarta ko, ek tay "pai" kii dharna kii vajah se kabhi-kabhi jito-haaro kaha jaataa he, yani ki ek vyakti kaa laabh duusare vyakti kii haani main parinat hota he
 This is true only when only one issue needs to be resolved, such as price in a simple sale agreement negotiation

 unka avribody vins darshan, yah bharosa dilaataa he ki samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya se sabhi dal labhanvit hote hai, jo "vijeta sab kuch le letaa he" ke virodhpurna drushtikon kii tulana main kahin adhik safal parinaamon ko utpann karata he
 Getting to Yes was published by Roger Fisher and William Ury as part of the Harvard Dialogue Project
 is pustak kaa drushtikon, jise saidhantik vaarta ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he, use kabhi-kabhi aapasi laabh saudebaaji bhi kaha jaataa he
 The mutual benefit approach has been effectively applied in environmental situations as well as in labor relations where the parties format the settlement negotiations as "problem solving"
 yadi kai muddon par charchaa hoti he, to dalon kii variyataon main bhinnata, "sabaki jai-jai" samjhauta vaarta ko sambhav banaati he
 For example, in a labor agreement negotiation, labor unions may prefer livelihood security over salary increases
 agar niyokta kii vipareet variyatayen hai, to ek saude kii sambhaavna hoti he jo donon dalon ke liye phydemand ho
 isliye aisi samjhauta vaarta ek virdohi shunya-laabh khel nahin he
 The theoretical compromise negotiation method is made up of four main steps: separating people from the problem, focusing on interests, not positions, generating various possibilities before deciding to do something and emphasizing that the outcome is based on the objective standard Be based aise kai or vidwaan hai jinhone samjhauta vaarta ke kshetra main yogadan diya he, jinamein shaamil hai UC barkale main holi shrouth or timothy deonote, tulane vishvavidhyalay main jerard i

 Perhaps the most famous parable of the settlement negotiations involves a discussion on orange
 sabase spasht drushtikon tha use aadha kaatna or prayek vyakti ko uskaa uchit hissaa mil jaataa
 lekin, jab vaartakaron ne ek duusare se apane hiton ko lekar baatcheet kerani shuru kii, to samasya kaa ek behatar samaadhaan spasht ho gaya
 The person willing to have orange juice for his breakfast took that part and the person wanting to make the jam took the skinned portion
 donon pakshon ko ant main adhik hi mila
 donon main se koi samjhauta vishesh rup se rachanaatmak nahin he
 The parable of the orange would become a story of creativity when the two sides decided to cooperate in planting an orange tree or a garden
 Similarly, Boeing buys composite plastic shells for its new 787 Dreamliner, designed and built by Japanese suppliers, and then sells the completed 787 back to Japanese airlines with good subsidies provided by the Japanese government
 yahi he vaarta main rachanaatmakataa kaa matlab
aajkal bijnes skulon main rachanaatmak prakriyaaon ke bare main kaaphi kuch siikhaa ja rahaa he
 Courses are being offered and research essays are proposed in academic conferences and corporate boardrooms making "innovation" a popular word
 or, navachaar or rachanaatmak prakriyaaon ke bare main jitna hi adhik suna jaataa he utana hi adhik ise saraahna milti he or jise samjhauta vaarta kaa japani drushtikon, swaabhaavik rup se, un tamaam takneekon kaa upyog karata he jis par, saamanytah rachanaatmak prakriya kii kisi bhi vaarta main bal diya jaataa he
 Of course, a deep basic explanation is provided for the fact that, despite the scarcity of natural resources and the state of relatively isolation, why the Japanese could build such a successful society
 Although in Japanese society too, there are undoubtedly some obstacles in the way of creativity - hierarchy and collectivism are two - however they have developed a style of negotiation that in many ways eradicates such unnecessary adversity
 vastav main, vaishvik vaarta ke liye harnandes or graham dwaara samarthit das nae niyam, us drushtikon se bhalee prakaar se mail khate hai jo japaniyon main swaabhaavik rup se dekhe jate hai: In addition to the practices of the Japanese people, credit should also be given to celebrities who have always advocated creativity in negotiation negotiations
 harvard rifa or unke sahyogiyon kii salaah he:


 tiimon ko ek saath anaupchaarik rup se sochna or yojana banani chahie or sanyukt rup se dimag ladaana chahie, jise "samvaad" yaa "purvacharchaa" samajha ja saktaa he
 There will be no coordination, commitment, or reasoning on how the two sides will split the pie at this early stage

 Even the use of words like "win-win" represents only a remnant of old competitive thinking
 mudda yah he ki ek vaarta koi aisi chiz nahin he jise jeeta yaa haara ja saktaa he or pratispardhaatmak roopak rachanaatmakataa ko pratibandhit karata he
 The problem-solving metaphor also does the same

 It is easy to bring Japanese into physical proximity, they have been living the same way for millennia
 japani companiyon main itane vipanan visheshgy nahin hai jo ejiniyaron se alag hai or jo vitt vishleshkon se alag hai
 Each manager may have worked in a number of functional areas, limiting the "chimney effect" that is often associated with US firms in disparate accents
 shaareerik harakat - theth japani kaarkaane main din kii shuruyaat ko chitrit karti he
 The Japanese, it seems, work best in small groups

 antaraal bhi japaniyon ke liye ek aam prakriya he 
 japani, un logon ke saath behatar kaam karenge jisase ve parichit hai 
 It should also be noted that some of these techniques will seem foreign to Japanese negotiators
 For example, diversity is not a strong companion for the Japanese - it would seem strange to purposefully add women and other elements of diversity to their groups
 However, there are two major things that Japanese people do in settlement negotiations that others can and should learn: First, the Japanese on this planet are champions of information emptiness
 ve apana munh band rakhte hai or baaki har kisi ko baat karne dete hai
 Thus, compared to any other society, they largely use the diversity of their international peers
 nakal or udhaar lene ke rup main aksar isaki aalochana kii jaati he, lekin sabhi ke vichaaron ke liye khulaa rahanaa vastav main hameshaa se rachanaatmakataa or maanav pragati ke liye mahatvapurn rahaa he
 Although the Japanese, like the rest of the world, are race-centric, they still respect foreign ideas very highly
 doosraa, japani keval dolphin ke saath kaam karenge, jab unke paas vikalp ho to
 vishwaas or rachanaatmakataa, sahagaami hai
 And, they train their foreign counterparts to behave in a more cooperative manner so that they can do well
 Consider the 25-year joint venture between Toyota and General Motors to manufacture small cars in Fremont, CA as a prime example
 rachanaatmakataa ke siddhanton kaa anupaalan vaarta ke dauraan kam se kam teen binduon main uchit hoga

 doosraa, anya log gatirodh ke maamle main unke prayog kii vakaalat karte hai
 For example, companies and environmental groups involved in the negotiations of the Rio Urubamba natural gas project in Peru reached a turning point that at the time was left unsettled - roads passing through ancient forests and a huge pipeline would be an ecological disaster
 
 What is a creative solution? Think of a remote gas field as an offshore platform, take the pipeline underground and transport personnel and equipment by airway as needed
 ant main, yahaan tak ki jab vaartakar "haa" par pahunche, to samjhaute kii ek nirdhaarit samiksha vastav main "haa" se aage badhate hue rachanaatmak parinaamon tak le jaayegi
 shaayad is tarah kii ek samiksha ko samjhaute ke karyanvayan ke chah maheene baad nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 But, the point is that separate time must be kept for constructive discussion on this subject, how to improve the people who are ready for the relationship? The focus of such a session should always be on unfolding new ideas - the answer to the question "what didn't we think about?" shell ne samjhauta vaarta ke liye paanch shaileyon / pratikriyaaon kii pahchaan kii he
 vyaktiyon main aksar kai shaileyon kii ore majboot jhukaav ho saktaa he; ek samjhauta vaarta ke dauraan istemaal kii jane vaali style, anya karkon ke saath-saath prasang or duusare dal ke hiton par nirbhar karti he
 In addition, style can also change over time
 jaahir he, samjhauta vaarta ke multah bhinn in do tareekon ko bhinn drushtikon kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 ise andekha karnaa parinaam ke liye vinaashkari ho saktaa he, lekin yah sab bhi aksar hota he
 Because each negotiator in the delivery approach struggles for the largest possible piece of the pie, it may be perfectly reasonable - within certain limits - that the other party be seen as an adversary rather than a partner and relatively little Strict attitude should be adopted
 But this stance would be unfair when the effort is to seal a system which is in the best interests of both the parties
 If both win, then it is important that who has benefited more
 ek acha samjhauta vah nahin jisamen adhiktam laabh ho, balki vah he jisamen ishtatam laabh ho
 lekin iskaa nihitarth yah bilkul nahin he ki hamen apane laabh ko yun hi chhod dena chahie
 lekin ek sahyogaatmak ravaiya, niyamit rup se labhaansh kaa bhugtan karegaa
 jo phayda hua he, vah duusare kii keemat par nahin he, balki uske saath he
 Emotion plays an important role in the negotiation process, although it is only in recent years that their impact is being studied
 jazbaat main yah kshamta he ki vah samjhauta vaarta main yaa to ek sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak bhoomika nibhaataa he
 During negotiations, the decision whether or not to seal the agreement now depends partly on emotional factors
 nakaaratmak bhavanaaen, teevr or yahaan tak ki tarkahin vyavhaar kaa kaaran ban sakati hai or sangharsh ko falit karte hue samjhauta vaarta ko khandit sakati hai, lekin riyaayaten paane main sahaayak ho sakati hai
 On the other hand, positive emotions often make it easier to reach an agreement and help to maximize joint profits, but can also be helpful in achieving concessions
 sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak asatat bhaawanaaon ko kaaryon or sambandhparak parinaamon ko prabhavit karne ke liye pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he or saanskrithik simaaon ke aar-paar yah bhinn bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 Emotion effect: Temperamental sentiment affects various stages of the negotiation process: what strategies are planned to be used, which strategies are actually chosen, the approach by which the other parties and their intentions are viewed, one His desire to reach agreement and the final outcome of the negotiations
 The positive efficacy and negative efficacy of one or more parties to the negotiation negotiations can lead to very different results
 samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya shuru hone se pehle, sakaaratmak bhav vaale logon main adhik aatmavishvaas, or ek sahyogaatmak ranneeti ke upyog kii yojana banane kii ucch pravriti hoti he
 During negotiation negotiations, negotiators who are in a positive mood tend to enjoy this interaction more, show less contentious behavior, use less aggressive tactics and adopt more collaborative strategies
 isse dalon dwaara apane mahatvapurn lakshya tak pahunchane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he or ekikrut laabh khojane kii kshamta kaa sanvardhan hota he
 Of course, negotiators with positive efficacy reached more agreements than negotiators with negative or natural efficacy, and they showed a greater tendency to respect those agreements
 These favorable outcomes resulted from better decision-making processes, such as flexible thinking, Creative problem solving, respecting others' attitudes, willingness to take risks and high confidence
 Even after negotiations positive results have beneficial results
 hasil kiye gaye parinaam ke saath yah santushti ko badhaata he or vyakti kii bhavishya kii sahabhaagita kii ichha ko prabhavit karata he
 The PA that emerged from reaching an agreement eases bilateral relations, increasing effective commitment that paves the way for subsequent engagement
 PA kii apni kamiyaan bhi hai: yah swa-pradarshan kii dharna ko vikrut karata he, is tarah ki pradarshan ko apekshaakrit behatar samajha jaataa he jitna vah vastav main nahin he
 Thus, studies with their own reports on the results obtained may be biased
 nakaaratmak bhav kaa samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya ke vibhinn charnon par hanikaarak prabhaav padataa he
 Although various negative emotions influence the outcomes of negotiations, the most research on anger has been done so far
 krodhi vaartakar, vaarta shuru hone se pehle hi pratispardhi ranneeti kaa adhik upyog karne kii yojana banaate hai or kam sahyog karte hai
 These competitive strategies are related to the combined results
 krodh, vaarta ke dauraan vishwaas ke str ko kam karte hue, dalon ke nirnay ko dhoomil karte hue, dalon ke kendrit dhyaan ko sankuchit karte hue prakriya ko baadhit karata he or samjhaute tak pahunchane ke unke kendriya lakshya ko badalte hue unhen duusare paksh ke khilaaf pratikriyaatmak banaata he
 Angry negotiators pay less attention to the opponent's interests and are less accurate in identifying their interests, thus giving them less joint advantage
 iske alaava, chunki krodh vaartakaron ko unki praathamiktaaon main adhik aatm-kendrit banaata he, yah is sambhaavna ko badha detaa he ki ve laabhadaayak peshkash ko asweekaar kar denge
krodh, samjhauta vaarta ke lakshyon ko praapt karne main madad bhi nahin karata he: yah sanyukt laabh ko kam kar detaa he or vyaktigat laabh ke vardhan main madad nahin karata, kyonki krodhit vaartakar apane liye kiye gaye adhik ke daavon safal nahin hote
 iske alaava, nakaaratmak bhavanaaen aise samjhauton ko sweekaar karne ko prerit karti hai jo sakaaratmak upyogetavaadi kriya vaala nahin he balki usamen nakaaratmak upyogita hoti he
 However, the expression of negative feelings during conciliation negotiations can sometimes be beneficial: justly expressed anger can be an effective way to show one's commitment, honesty, and needs
 iske alaava, haalanki NA, ekikrut kaaryon main laabh ko kam kar detaa he, vitaran kaaryon main yah PA se ek behatar ranneeti he 
 nakaaratmak bhav utpatti or shwet rav par apane kaam main, cednar ko, anya jaateey mul ke vaktaaon ke avamulyan ke sambandh main prekshan ke madhyam se ek nakaaratmak bhav utpatti tantra ke astitv ke liye samarthan praapt hua
 "conciliation negotiations may, in turn, be negatively affected by a hostile envy of an ethnic group or a gender group
 anusandhan darshata he ki vaartakar kii bhavanaaen aavashyak rup se samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya ko prabhavit nahin karti
 albrasine va anya ne suzav diya ki bhaavnaatmak prabhaav ke liye do sthitiyaan hai, donon hi kshamta se or prerana se sambandhit hai: According to this model, emotions are likely to affect negotiation only when one is high and the other is low
 jab kshamta or prerana, donon hi nimna hai to bhav kii pahchaan nahin kii ja sakegi or jab donon hi ucch hai to bhav kii pahchaan kii ja sakegi lekin faisle ke liye ise apraasangik mana jayega
udhaaharan ke liye, is model kaa ek sambhav nihitarth yah he ki vaarta par PA ke sakaaratmak prabhaavon ko tabhi dekha ja saktaa he jab yaa to prerana yaa kshamta nimna hai
 Most studies on emotion in negotiation negotiations focus on the effect of the negotiator's own feelings on the process
 haalanki, aglaa dal kya sochataa he yah bhi utana hi mahatvapurn ho saktaa he, hamen pataa he ki samooh bhavanaaen vyaktigat str or samooh ke str par prakriyaaon ko prabhavit karti he
 When it comes to negotiation, trust in the other party is necessary to influence its feeling and visibility increases the effect
 bhavanaaen, samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya main is prakaar yogadan detii hai ki ye yah sanket detii hai ki vyakti kya mahasoos karata he or sochataa he or is prakaar anya dal ko vighatnkaaree vyavhaar main ulajhane se roak sakati hai or ingit karti hai ki aglaa kadam aage kya hona chahie: PA bhi yahi sanket detaa he, jabaki NA ingit karata he ki maansik yaa vyavahaargat samaayojan kii aavashyaktaa haisathi kii bhaawanaaon kaa vaartakar kii bhaawanaaon or vyavhaar par do buniyadi prabhaav ho saktaa he: anukaranaatmak / parsparik yaa poorak
 udhaaharan ke liye, niraashaa yaa udaasi, dayaa or adhik sahyog ko prerit karegi
 bat va anya dwaara ek adhyayan main jisane vaastavik bahu charan samjhauta vaarta kii nakal kii, zyaadaatar logon ne saathi kii bhaawanaaon ke prati poorak tareeke kii bajaay parsparik tareeke se pratikriya vyakt kii
dekha gaya ki virdohi kii bhaawanaaon or chaynit ranneetiyon par vishisht bhaawanaaon kaa alag-alag prabhaav hota he: Negotiations are a complex interaction
 isaki sari jatiltaaon ko aavrutt karnaa ek bahut hi mushkil kaam he, iske sirf kuch pahaluon ko alag or niyantrit kiya gaya he
 For this reason, most studies of negotiation are conducted under laboratory conditions and they throw light on only a few aspects
 haalanki prayogshaala adhyayan ke apane phaayde hai, unki kuch pramukh kamiyaan hai jab bhaawanaaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he : The primary objective of this section is to demonstrate the extent of cultural differences in settlement negotiations and to show how these differences can cause problems in international trade negotiations
 pathak yah dekhenge ki rashtriya samskruti samjhauta vaarta ke vyavhaar kaa nirdhaaran nahin karti he
 Rather, national culture is one of many factors that influence behavior at the negotiating table, albeit in a significant way
 For example, gender, organizational culture, international experience, industry, or regional background can all have significant impacts
 beshak, sabhi prakaar kaa rudh praaroop khatarnaak hai or antarrashtriya vaartakaron ko un logon ke bare main zarur jaananaa chahie jinke saath ve kaam kar rahe hai, sirf unke desh, samskruti, yaa company ke bare main hi nahin
 The material here is based on a systematic study of the international settlement negotiations behavior of the last three decades, considering the negotiation styles of more than 1500 people from 17 industry-related countries
 is kaam main anbhavi adhikariyon kaa saakshaatkaar or is kshetra main bhagidaari karne vaale logon kii tippaniyan shaamil thim, saath hi saath vyavhaar vigyaan ke prayogshaala kaary the jisamen shaamil tha video tepe kii gai vaarta kaa surveykshan or vishleshan

 in deshon ko isliye chunaa gaya kyonki ve america ke vartmaan or bhavishya ke sabase mahatvapurn vyapaarik bhagidaaron kaa gathan karte hai
 Looking broadly across many cultures, two important lessons can be drawn
 pehla yah he ki kshetreey samanyikaran aksar sahi nahin hote hai
 For example, the style of Japanese and Korean settlement negotiations are in some ways quite similar, but in other ways they may look more different
 anusandhan se pataa chalaa doosraa sabak he ki japan ek asaadhaaran sthaan he: samjhauta vaarta kii style ke lagbhag har aayam par, japani log, paimaane par ant yaa phir uske paas hai
 For example, in the cultures studied, Japanese people use minimal eye contact
 kabhi-kabhi, america duusare chor par hote hai
 But in fact, most of the time Americans are somewhere in between
 pathak dekhenge ki yah baat is anubhag main prastut aankadon main zaahir hoti he
 The Japanese approach, however, is the most different, even unique
 saanskrithik bhinnataayen, antarrashtriya vyapaarik vaartaon main chaar prakaar kii samasyaon ko janm detii hai, nimna staron par: Sequence is important; The problems on the list downstream are serious because they are more subtle
 udhaaharan ke liye, do vaartakar turant dhyaan denge agar ek japani bol rahaa he or doosraa german
 is samasya kaa samaadhaan, ek anuvadak ko kaam par rakhane yaa ek aam tritiy bhashaa main baat karne se saral kiya ja saktaa he yaa phir yah kisi bhashaa ko seekhney jitna mushkil ho saktaa he
 Regardless of the solution, the problem is clear
 saanskrithik bhinnata amaukhik vyavhaar he, duusari taraf, yah lagbhag hameshaa hamaari jaagrukta ke prishth main chipa hota he
 We can say that in a face-to-face negotiation, participants take and give a lot more information, non-verbally - and in a more subtle way
 kuch visheshgyon kaa tark he ki yah jaankaree, maukhik jaankaree se kahin adhik mahatvapurn he
 Almost all this signal goes below the level of our consciousness
 jab videshi bhagidaaron ke amaukhik sanket bhinn hote hai, to vaartakar use galat rup main samajhane ke bahut nazadik hote hai or aise main ve galati ke prati jaagruk bhi nahin hote
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab ek french graahak lagaataar vyavdhaan utpann karata he, to americanyon ko bahut asahaj mahasoos hota he bina yah dekh ki vastav main aisa kyon he
 In this way, interpersonal confrontation, often affecting business relationships, remains invisible and, consequently, cannot be rectified
 Differences in values and thinking and decision making process are hidden deep and hence they become difficult to diagnose due to which they are not treated properly
 These differences are discussed below, beginning with language and nonverbal behavior
 antarrashtriya vaartaon main anuwaad samasyaayein aksar mahatvapurn hoti hai
 And, when languages are linguistically isolated, more problems should be anticipated
 Global settlement negotiations in particular can be a challenging task
 aksar angreji bhashaa kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, lekin mej par ise adhikansh adhikariyon dwaara duusari bhashaa ke rup main bolaa ja saktaa he
 In fact, native speakers of England, India and America often have trouble understanding each other
 antarrashtriya sahabhaagitaaon main main sateek anuwaad, ek lakshya he jise lagbhag kabhi praapt nahin kiya gaya he
 In addition, variations of language are sometimes used in interesting ways
 videshi deshon main kai varisht adhikari thodi angrezi bolte or samajhate hai, lekin apni "majboot" deshi bhashaa main bolnaa or ek dubhashiya prayog karnaa pasand karte hai
 Thus, we have seen a senior Russian interlocutor asking questions in Russian
 dubhashiya ne phir apane america samakaksh ke liye prashn ko anudit kiya
 When the interpreter was speaking, the American's attention was towards the interpreter
 haalanki, roosi kii nigahon kii disha america kii taraf thi
 Therefore, the Russian could notice the facial expressions and nonverbal reactions of the American with great attention and without any interference
 iske atirikt, jab america bol rahaa tha, to varisht roosi ke paas pratikriya dene kaa duguna samay tha
 Because he understood English, he could formulate his response during the translation process
 pratikriya dene ke is atirikt samay kaa ek ranneetik samjhauta vaarta main kya mahatv he? ek ucch daanv vaali vyapaar vaarta main apane sheersh str ke samakaksh kii amaukhik pratikriyaaon par dhyanpurvak gaur karne main sakasham hone ke kya phaayde hai? sahaj rup se kaha jaae to, americanyon ke liye dwibhashavad ek aam lakshan nahin he or isliye antarrashtriya vaanijya main bhashaa main ucch kaushal vaale pratiyogiyon ko ek prakritik laabh hasil hota he
 In addition, a common complaint heard from US managers relates to discussions among foreign clients and partners in their native language
 spasht rup se, ise ashishtataa samajha jaataa he or aksar america vaartakaron dwaara is videshi baatcheet main kuch ashubh gun dekhe jane kii sambhaavna rahati he - "ve yojana bana rahe hai yaa rahasy bataa rahe hai
 "this is a frequent American mistake
 aisi aapasi charchaaon kaa saamaanya prayojan, anuwaad kii samasya ko sudhaarna hota he
 For example, one Korean may bow to another Korean and ask "what did he say?" Or, mutual discussion may be related to a disagreement between members of the foreign party
 donon hi paristhitiyon ko americanyon dwaara sakaaratmak sanket ke rup main dekha janaa chahie - arthath, anuwaad ko sateek samajhnaa, sahabhaagita kii kshamta ko badhaata he or isamen kotahi aksar aantarik asahmati ko janm detii hai
 But since most Americans speak only one language, both situations will not be appreciated
 By the way, it is advisable for the people of other countries to give a short description of the contents of their first few mutual discussions to the Americans so that no unpleasant perception develops
 lekin, anuwaad or dubhashiyon se pare bhi bhashaa ke str par kuch samasyaayein hai
 Pseudo-dialogue figures are informative
 adhyayan main, 15 samskritiyon ke vaartakaron ke maukhik vyavhaar ko video tepe kiya gaya
 The numbers in the section of Exhibit 1 represent the percentage of statements that are classified into each listed category
 arthath, japani vaartakaron dwaara die gaye bayanon ke 7 pratishat ko vaade, 4 pratishat ko dhamkee, 7 pratishat ko siforeeshon, ke rup main vargeekrut kiya gaya
 The verbal bargaining practices used by negotiators during pseudo-negotiations proved surprisingly similar in all cultures
 Negotiations in all 15 cultures were primarily built on information-cooperation strategies - questions and self-disclosures
 Note that Israelis are at the low end in the order of self-disclosure
 unka 30 pratishat sabhi 15 samoohon main nunatam tha, jiskaa taatpary tha ki ve jaankaree dene main sabase adhik anicchhuk the
 Overall, however, the method of verbal strategies used was surprisingly similar across diverse cultures
 pradarsh 1 par jaaen, 15 samskritiyon main maukhik vaarta ranneeti, : Anthropologist Ray L
 Birdwichel demonstrated that less than 35% of the message in a dialogue is conveyed by the spoken word while the other 65% is communicated nonverbal
 albert mehrabian, ek UCLA manovaigyanik ne bhi aamane-saamne kii sahabhaagita main jahaan se arth upajte hai uski padvyakhya kii he
 He reports: beshak, kuch log sateek pratishat ke saath hila-hawali kar sakate hai, lekin hamaara kaam is dharna kaa bhi samarthan karata he ki amaukhik vyavhaar mahatvapurn hai - chizon ko kaise kaha jaataa he yah aksar is baat se adhik mahatvapurn hota he ki kya kaha gaya
 Exhibit 2 provides an analysis of some linguistic aspects and nonverbal behavior of 15 videotape groups, that is, how things are said
 haalanki ye prayaas keval, is prakaar ke vyavhaar vishleshan kii sataha ko kharonchte hai, ve tab bhi paryaapt saanskrithik matbhedon ke sanket uplabdh karaate hai
 Note that, once again, the Japanese are at or near the end of this sequence on almost every dimension listed in behavior
 in 15 samoohon main unke chehre kii anymanskta or chhuan nunatam he
 Only the North Chinese used the term more often, and only the Russians used more silent periods than the Japanese
 pradarsh 2 par jaaen, 15 samskritiyon main bhashaa or amaukhik vyavhaar ke bhashaai pahalu : a comprehensive test of the data in Exhibits 1 and 2 reveals a more meaningful conclusion: differentiation across cultures is found in comparing linguistic aspects of language and nonverbal behaviors compared to considering the oral content of the dialogue

 Japan In line with most descriptions of Japanese negotiation behavior, the result of this analysis shows that their style of engagement is the least aggressive
 Threats, orders and warnings are discouraged in favor of more positive promises, recommendations and commitments
 unki vinamr samvaad style kaa vishesh sanket, unke nahin or tum ke nune prayog or chehre ke haavbhaav se miltaa he, saath hi saath chuppi bhari avadhiyon se bhi
 Perhaps a more interesting aspect of Korea analysis is the contrast of the Asian dialogue style
 non-asians often make generalizations about Eastern countries; The findings demonstrate that this is a mistake
 japani kii tulana main korian vaartakaron ne kaaphi adhik dand or aadesh kaa prayog kiya
 The Koreans used the word no more than three times as much as the Japanese and intervened
 iske alaava, korian vaartakaron ke madhya khamoshi kii koi avadhi nahin thi
 China 
 The behavior of the interlocutors of North China was most notable in asking questions
 Of course, 70 percent of the statements made by Chinese negotiators were classified as information exchange strategies
 unke vyavhaar ke anya pahalu japanyon ke kaaphi samaan the, vishesh rup se nahin or tum or khamosh avadhi kaa prayog
 Taiwan
 The behavior of the business people in Taiwan was quite different from that of China and Japan but similar to that of Korea
 chehre par dekhne ke samay main taiwan par chini asaadhaaran the - ausat rup se 20 yaa 30 minute lagbhag
 kisi anya asian samooh kii tulana main unhone kam sawaal poocha or adhik jaankaree pradaan kii 
 Russia
 The Russian style was quite different from any other European group and, in fact, was quite similar to the Japanese style in many ways
 unhone nahin or tum kaa kam hi istemaal kiya or kisi bhi anya samooh kii tulana main khamoshi bhari avadhi kaa sabase adhik istemaal kiya
 Only Japanese see less facial expressions and only Chinese ask most questions
 israel israeli vaartakaron kaa vyavhaar teen maamalon main vishisht tha
 As mentioned above, he used the lowest percentage of private-disclosures, apparently holding his card relatively
 Alternatively, the highest percentage of promises and recommendations were used, making unusually heavy use of these persuasion strategies
 5 pratishat ke saath ve pramanik apil ke pratishat ke paimaane par ant main the jahaan pratiyogiyon kii peshkash kaa sarvaadhik sandarbh tha
 Perhaps most importantly, Israeli negotiators interrupt each other more often than negotiators of any other party
 darasal, is mahatvapurn amaukhik vyavhaar ke liye hi sambhavit rup se unhen "dhakelu" ke rudh praaroop se nawaaza jaataa he jo aksar americanyon dwaara unke samjhauta vaarta ke israeli bhagidaaron kaa varnan ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Germany It is difficult to characterize the behavior of the Germans as they place themselves in the middle in almost all order
 haalanki, german, nijee-khulaase ke maamle main ucch pratishat ke saath tathaa prashnon ke maamle main kam pratishat ke saath asaadhaaran the
 The behavior of British negotiators in the United Kingdom was remarkably similar to the American people in all respects
 zyaadaatar british vaartakaron main samjhauta vaarta karne ke maamle main sahi tareeke or galat tareeke kii ek majboot bhaavana hoti he
 Protocol is very important
 spain samjhauta vaarta ke spanish drushtikon ke liye diga shaayad ek acha roopak he, jo hamaare aankade main dikhataa he
 When you make a phone call in Madrid, the response usually from the other end is not a hola, but rather, a dig
 isliye isamen aashcharya kii baat nahin he ki video tepe vaarta main bhi spanish ne vaise hi kisi anya samooh kii apeksha, adeshon ke sarvaadhik pratishat kaa istemaal kiya or apekshaakrit kam jaankaree pradaan kii 
 iske alaava, kisi bhi anya samooh kii tulana main unhone aksar adhik baadha utpann kii or unhone nahin or tum shabd kaa kaaphi prayog kiya
 France The style of the French negotiators was perhaps the most aggressive of all groups
 vishesh rup se, unhone dhamkee or chetavaniyon ke sarvaadhik pratishat kaa istemaal kiya
 Compared to other groups, he used intervention, face-to-face and not and you too often, and a French negotiator also touched his partner's hand during a pseudo-negotiation
 brazil
 brazili udyog jagat ke log, french or spanish ke samaan kaaphi aakraamak the
 Among all groups, they used the second highest percentage of orders
 ausat rup se, brazilian ne 30 minute kii samjhauta vaarta ke dauraan 42 baar nahin shabd, 90 baar tum shabd kaa prayog kiya or ek-duusare ke haath ko 5 baar chuaa
 chehre par nigahen bhi adhik thim
 Mexico
 The patterns of Mexican behavior in our negotiation negotiations have been good reminders of the dangers of regional or language group generalization
 unke donon maukhik or amaukhik vyavhaar, apane latin america yaa mahadwipiya chachere bhaaiyon se kaaphi bhinn the
 Actually, people in Mexico answer the telephone more efficiently
 In many respects, the behavior of Mexican negotiators was very similar to that of the United States
 french-bhashi canadow french bhashi canadai ne apane mahadwipiya bhaaiyon ke kaaphi samaan vyavhaar kiya
 Like the French negotiators, they also used a higher percentage of threats and warnings and had relatively more interference and eye contact
 is tarah kii mail-milaap kii aakraamak style, kuch asian samooh yaa angreji bhashi canadai sahit anya angrezi bolne waalon kii shantimay style se mail nahin khaati he
 English-speaking Canadians The Canadians who spoke English as the first language used the lowest percentage of aggressive tactics of persuasion among all 15 groups
 Perhaps, as dialogue researchers suggest, such stylistic differences seed the inner-ethnic race, as seen in Canada over the years
 antarrashtriya vaarta ke sambandh main, angrezi bhashi canadaayiyon ne canada ke pramukh vyapaarik saajhedaaron america or japan, donon kii tulana main zaahir taur par hastkshepon or nahin kaa adhik prayog kiya
 United States of america 
 Like the Germans and the British, the Americans live in the middle for most of the order
 anya logon kii tulana main unhone beshak ek-duusare ko kam baadhit kiya, lekin unamem yahi ekmaatr fark tha
 Variations in these cultures are quite complex and this material by itself should not be used to predict the behavior of foreign counterparts
 Instead, special care should be taken with respect to the so-called threats of the orthodox format
 It is important here to be aware of such variations, so that Japanese silence, Brazilian "no, no 


," or French intimidation are not misunderstood
 charchaa kii gai 15 samskritiyon ke alaava, neeche bumadhya kshetra main samjhauta vaarta ke drushtikon par ek ansh he
 “the Mediterranean culture is completely warm-hearted

 It is difficult to clearly explain settlement negotiations in particular deals or at particular stages of negotiation
 kuch kshetron main, saude ko 'snehan' kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In fact, this question of 'lubrication' is important for some cultures in Mediterranean countries
 ise ek saamaanya abhyaas ke rup main dekha jaataa he or isamen 'rishwatakhori' kaa pratikaarak charitra nahin he
 The approach to negotiating settlement in these cultures requires the discipline that we were discussing; And even then one should be aware of the need for lubrication
 As any respectable Western company would like to engage in the practice of bribery, the need is to obtain a local agency and ensure that that agency is handling lubrication
 " The four managerial values - fairness, competition, equality, and punctuality, which are strongly held by most Americans, often appear to lead to misunderstandings and bad feelings in international trade negotiations
 "america, antim bindu or thande, kathor tathyon par par aadhaarit nirnay lete hai
 "" Americans do not play nepotism
 " "arthshaastra or pradarshan kaa mulya he, logon kaa nahin

 "such statements well reflect American views of the importance of fairness
 samjhauta vaarta ke vishay par ekmaatr sarvaadhik safal kitaab, gating tu yas, ko videshi or america, donon pathakon ke liye atyadhik sifarish kii jaati he
 Foreigners will not only learn about negotiation but, perhaps more importantly, learn what the American people think about negotiations
 lekhak "vyakti ko samasya se alag karne par" atyadhik drudh hai or ve kehete hai ki, "prayek vaartakar ke do prakaar ke hit hote hai: padaarth main or rishte main

 In most places of the world, especially in group-oriented, high-context cultures, personality and substance are not separate issues and cannot be separated
 udhaaharan ke liye, vichaar kiijie ki chini yaa hispanic samskritiyon main bhai-bhatijawad kitna mahatvapurn he
 Experts point out that businesses in the growing "chinese Commonwealth" do not extend beyond the limits and ties of rigid family control
 "in Spain, Mexico, and the Philippines, similar work is done

 Pseudo-negotiation can be seen as a type of experimental economics where the value of each cultural group participating is almost reflected in economic outcomes

 At least 40 people from each culture's industry played the same buyer-seller game and negotiated a settlement on the prices of three products
 Depending on the final agreement, the "negotiation pie" can be further enhanced through cooperation, before it is split between buyer and seller
 The results are summarized in Display 3

 The Czechs and Germans behaved as more competitive

 in chhadam vyapaarik vaartaon ke parinaam puri tarah se anya lekhakon kii tippaniyon or is kahawat ke saath sangat he ki japan main kharidaar "kinger" he
 Americans have little understanding of the Japanese practice of paying full respect to buyer's wishes
 america main chijen aise kaam nahin karatin hai
 American sellers treat American buyers more as an equal, and the egalitarian values of American society support this behavior
 in nishkarshon main pratibimbit, vyaktvaad or pratiyogita par diya jane vaala america jor, girt homested ke kaary se kaaphi sangat rakhata he, jo sanket detaa he ki vyaktivaadee paimaane par americanyon ne anya sabhi saanskrithik samoohon kii tulana main ucchtam ank praapt kiye
 iske alaava, dekha gaya he ki vyaktvaad / samashtiwad ke mulyon ne kai anya deshon main samjhauta vaarta ke vyavhaaron ko sidhe prabhavit kiya he
 Finally, not only do Japanese buyers get more results from American buyers, but compared with American sellers, Japanese sellers also get a larger share of the commercial pie
 dilachasp rup se, jab in parinaamon ko dikhaaya jaataa he to kaaryakari seminaron main america abhi bhi aksar america vikreta kii bhoomika pasand karte hai
 In other words, even though American sellers make less profit than Japanese, many American managers apparently prefer less profit if that profit stems from the same division of a combined profit
 "bas unhen pratiksha karavaaen
" duniya main baaki har koi jaanata he ki americanyon ke saath koi anya samjhauta vaarta ranneeti adhik upyogi nahin he, kyonki koi anya samay ko itnaa mulya nahin detaa, chizon ke dhimaa hone par koi anya itnaa adheer nahin hota or americanyon se zyaada baar koi apni kalai ghadi par nazar nahin daalata

 The two sides agreed that the talks would be held in one neutral location, south of France
 In previous negotiations, Russia was harsh but justified

 They had become more rigid and were, in fact, completely inappropriate according to the officers involved with Solar
 americanyon ne samasya ke nidaan main kuch kathin din bitaye, lekin ek baar ho jane ke baad, san diego mukhyalay main waapas ek mahatvapurn phone kiya gaya
 Why did the Russians become so rude? They were enjoying the warm weather in Nice and were unwilling to go back to Moscow after finalizing a quick deal! Calling California was a significant event in the negotiations
 san diego main solar ke mukhyalay ke log itane parishkrut the ki unhone apane vaartakaron ko paryaapt samay lene kii anumati di

 Finally, during the fourth week, the Russians began making concessions and demanded longer meetings
 Why? After spending four weeks on the Mediterranean, he could not return to Moscow without a signed contract

 When faced with a complex task of negotiating negotiations, most Westerners divide vast tasks into a series of smaller tasks

 tab aapako aashcharya hoga agar aapkaa kaam ho jaae
 aksar, america, duusare paksh dwaara samjhaute kii ghoshnaa se thik pehle anaavashyak riyaayaten dete hai
 For example, an American department store executive who was traveling to Japan to buy six different consumer products for his chain expressed remorse that negotiations for the first product took a full week
 sanyukt rajya america main, is tarah kii ek kharid ko ek dopaher bhar main antim rup de diya jaataa he
 So, according to his calculations, he felt that it would take six weeks in Japan to complete his purchase
 He considered raising purchase prices in an attempt to speed up the process
 lekin isse pehle ki vah is tarah ke riyaayat main sakasham ho, japani sheeghra hi sirf teen dinon main baaki paanch anya utpaadon par bhi sahamat ho gaye
 This particular manager, according to his own confession, considered himself lucky in his first encounter with the Japanese bargainers
 is america kaaryakari kii lagbhag ek badi galati, nirnay lene kii style main antar se zyada kuch ko darshaati he
 For Americans, a trade settlement negotiation is a problem-solving activity, the solution for both parties is the best deal
 duusari taraf, ek japani vyapaaree ke liye, ek vyapaarik samjhauta vaarta, ek lambii avadhi ke parsparik laabh ke lakshya ke liye vyapaarik sambandhon ko viksit karne kaa samay he
 Economic issues are a reference to dialogue, not content
 Thus, the resolution of any one issue is not really so important
 yadi ek baar ek vyavhaarya, saamanjasypurna vyapaarik sambandh sthapit ho jaae to aise vivaran khud-ba-khud hal ho jaayenge
 or, jaisaa ki khudara vastuon ke kharidaar ke maamle main upar hua, ek baar jab sambandh sthapit ho gaya - pehle samjhaute se chihnit - anya "vivaran" shighrata se hal ho gaye
 American bargainers should anticipate such a holistic approach common in Asian cultures and be prepared to negotiate conciliation on all issues in an apparently disorganized order
 Progress in negotiations should not be measured by how many issues have been resolved
 balki, americanyon ko vyapaarik sambandhon kii gunvattta ko naapane kii koshish kerani chahie
 pragati ke mahatvapurn sanket nimna ho sakate hai: When considering the potential problems in negotiations between different cultures, especially when you mix the relationship-oriented culture with the information-oriented managers, one is surprised that any international trade is complete
 jaahir he, vaishvik vyapaar kii aarthik anivaarytaayen, sambhavit nuksaan ke baavjood isse labhanvit hoti hai
 But appreciating cultural differences results in even better international commercial transactions - the goal of international trade negotiations is not just business deals but creative and highly profitable business relationships that are the real goals

 Writing, listening and discussion are specific roles that team members should satisfy
 a team's capacity base reduces the amount of mistakes and increases intimacy in a settlement negotiation

 Then India reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is not a reliable partner, then Nehru decided to make himself a nuclear power country instead of being determined to trust someone else, whose blueprint was given to Bhabha in 1965, who was King Ramanna Subjugated and after his death the nuclear weapons program was carried forward
