 wasim rizvi kaa kahana he ki vivaadit jameen par bhagwaan shriram kaa mandir bane taaki hindu or musalamaanon ke bich kaa vivaad hameshaa ke liye khatm ho or desh main aman kaayam ho sake

 vivaadit jagah se masjid ko hataakar duusare sthaan par banane ke raay par pichley dinon sunni central vakf board sahamat nahin he
 Significantly, Rizvi has prepared a draft to resolve the settlement of the Ayodhya dispute
 shiya vakf board ke masaude ke mutabik vivaadit jagah par ram mandir banaai jaae or masjid lakhanu main banaai jaae
 Instead of naming this mosque after a king or ruler, the mosque should be named Aman
 shiya vakf board ke masaude ke mutabikmasjid ayodhyaamein na banaai jaae, balki uski jagah lakhanu main banaai jaae
 For this, in front of Ghanta Ghar in Old Lucknow's Hussainabad, there is the land of Shia Waqf Board, on which the mosque should be built and its name should be named "masjid-e-aman" instead of a Muslim king or ruler
 board ne ayodhya ke vivaadit maamle kaa formula 18 navambar ko supreme court main jamaa kara diya
 Among the signatories to this draft Shia Central Waqf Board, Suresh Das of Digambar Akhara, Dharmadas of Hanuman Garhi, Bhaskar Das of Nirmohi Akhara besides Ram Vilas Vedanti, Gopaldas and Narendra Giri
 shiya central vakf board ke adhyaksh wasim rizvi ne kaha- hamane ayodhya vivaad ke hal kaa masauda (masjid-e aman) supreme court main daakhil kar diya he, ye masauda tamaam logon se baatcheet khaskar hindu pakshakaron se baatcheet ke baad taiyaar kiya gaya he, or is par sabhi sahamat hai
 Rizvi said that Hindus and Shias agree on this, Sunni Waqf Board has nothing to do with it, it is also in the court, we are also in the court, the court will decide
 unhone kaha ki ayodhya kii bajaae hamane lakhanu main isliye prastaavit kii he kyoki puraani lakhanu me ghantaghar ke saamne badi jameen maujuud he, yahaan shiya aabaadi bhi kaaphi he or vivaadon se dur he isliye hamaara formula yahi he

 After this, Sapna Chaudhary had made a big dent in Bollywood, Punjabi and Bhojpuri films too
 bataa den ki sapana choudhary bollywood main bhi film 'dosti ke said effects' se dhamal machaa chuki hai
 Although his film could not do wonders at the box office, but his acting was highly praised

 chunaav ke dauraan hamane sari maryaadaaon kaa paalan karte hue muddon ke aadhaar par chunaav ladaa or jo bhi kaam hamane kiya tha uski ko lekar chunaav abhiyaan main utre the
 But taking moral responsibility for the loss that has been lost, i have resigned my resignation to the Governor '

 With this, Nitish said that he accepts the results of the Lok Sabha elections

 He will take over the reins of the government and will go ahead, respecting the diversity of the country

 He said that jdu's decision to break away from the BJP was taken on the basis of principle and after that we had also clearly explained its reasons, its background had been prepared for months

 On the other hand, on Nitish's resignation, Bihar BJP President Mangal Pandey said that the public rejected Nitish
 janata ne unhen bataaya ki jo aapane kaam kiya, vah asaliyat main bhaajapa dwaara kiya gaya kaam he, so bhaajapa ko vot mila
 Mangal Pandey said, Nitish used to openly ask for votes for the work
 kehete the ki maine jo kaam kiya uske liye mazdooree den, lekin janata ne unhen mazdooree dene se inkaar kar diya

 After VVS Laxman's 85-run innings, the fast bowlers' triumph led the West Indies top order to give India a resounding comeback in the second Test cricket match
 match kaa pehla din gendbaajon ke naam rahaa tathaa kul 13 wicket gire
 India had a poor start and lost the top four wickets within 38 runs
 iske baad lakshmana ne suresh raina (53) ke saath paanchaven wicket ke liye 117 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 India lost 201 runs after losing the last six wickets for 46 runs
 westeindies kaa score bhi jab paanch ran tha, tab uske donon salaami ballebaaj pavilion laut gaye the
 He scored 30 for three at the end of the first day's play and is still 171 runs behind India
 ishanth sharma, praveen kumaar or abhimanyu mithun teenon ne ek-ek wicket lekar pehle din bharat kaa palada kuch baari rakhaa
 In the fourth over of the innings, Ishant made Adrian Barath (3) the victim of short pitch ball
 ishanth kii gend barath ke balle ke bich ke hisse se lagakar gali main khadey viraat kohli ke paas pahunchi, jinhone kaich kaa abhyaas kiya
 In the next over, the ball carrying Praveen Kumar's swing took the outside edge of Lendl Simmons (2) with the wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni's gloves
 ab mithun kii baari thi, jinhone din ke antim over main derren braavo (9) ko dhoni ke haathon kaich karaayaa
 Bravo, however, was not happy with the decision

 For the Indians, eight overs of Rampal's first season were nothing short of a nightmare, in which he took three wickets for five runs
 unhone abhinav mukund (1), murali vijay (11) or viraat kohli (shunya) ko pavilion bheja, jabaki rahul dravid (5) carabian captain derren saimi ke shikaar bane
 After lunch, both Laxman and Raina missed no chance to score runs
 pehle satr main bharat jahaan 27 over main 44 ran hi jod paaya or usne chaar wicket ganvaae, vahiin duusare satr main usne 26 over main 103 ran banaae or is bich uskaa koi wicket nahin gira
 Laxman meanwhile scored 50th in Test cricket, while Raina completed his fourth half-century
 tisare satr main kahani phir se badal gai jisamen bharat ne 15 over main 54 ran jodakar baaki bache chah wicket ganvaae
 This season saw the amazing bowling of Bishoo and Edwards
 bishu ne lakshmana or raina ke alaava praveen (12) ko out kiya, jabaki edwards ne dhoni (2), harbhajan (5), or mithun (shunya) ko pavilion bheja
 The second season was entirely titled Indians, with artistic strokes of Laxman and bold shots of Raina
 lekin chaay ke vishram ke baad in donon kii saajhedaari lambii nahin chali
 In the third over of the third season, Bishu got the much-awaited success to West Indies by dismissing Raina
 vaise yadi is shrunkhlaa main ampiron kii nirnay samiksha pranali (udiares) hoti to raina pavilion nahin lautate
 Bishu's ball suddenly bounced towards the leg stump, which hit Raina's Thai pad and went to the short leg fielder
 westeindies kii apil main bhi zyada dam nahin tha, lekin ampire asad rouf kii anguli uth gai
 Raina was not happy with the decision
 vah is ummid main boundry par bhi khadey rahe ki kya pataa ampire apana faisle main sudhaar kar den
 He played 105 balls in his innings and hit seven fours
 iske baad bhartiya pari simtane main der nahin lagi
 The sequence of captain Dhoni's failure continued here, while Harbhajan also failed
 lakshmana bhi test cricket main 8,000waan ran puraa karne ke turant baad bishu kii leg brake par cat karne ke prayaas main becoward point par kaich thama diya
 His 146-ball innings included 12 fours

 When he met Manoj in jail, Manoj along with his three other colleagues prepared this whole plan of loot
 aarush apane ayyashi ke kharche ke liye bahut pareshaan tha, kyonki uski maa bhi use bedakhal kar chuki thi or apni beemaari par bhi ko kaaphi kharch kar rahaa tha, lekin jab pareshaan ho gaya tha to usne badi lut kii yojana banaai
 As soon as Diwali came out of the entire gang, the love was robbed by Mr

 In a statement released on Friday, Mayawati said that while giving BJP communal color to the case of alleged migration from Kairana, along with its political gains, it is very much in force, but the SP government too forgets the Raj Dharma and such elements Is not taking any action against unhone kaha ki basapa kii maang he ki bhadakaane kaa kaam karne waalon ke khilaaf tatkaal sakht karrwai kii jaye
 Otherwise, Uttar Pradesh will once again burn in the fire of communal riots, which will be solely responsible for the SP and its government
 basapa adhyaksh ne gorakhpur main ek sapa netaa kii thane main pitayee ke maamle main varisht police adheekshak anant dev ke nilamban ko anuchit kadam bataate huye kaha ki sapa sarkaar puure taur par jangalraj se ghir chuki he
 It seems that the SP government of the state, like the central BJP government, is acting with a wrong, casteist and biased mindset and punishing all those officers who are having a little courage to work impartially according to the law
 unhone kaha ki gorakhpur jile ke varisht police adheekshak kaa kasoor sirf itnaa tha ki unki police ne ek sapa netaa kii gundai or dabangai ko rokane kii koshish kii thi
 Will the law and order of the state ever be improved by such wrong actions
 mayawati ne kaha ki yah ek or udhaaharan he jisase pataa chalata he ki sapa ke gundon, badmaashon, mafiaon, arajak, aapraadhik or sampradayik tatwon ke aage adhikariyon kii bilkul bhi nahin chal paa rahi he
 Referring to a report published in the media about the Home Ministry investigation related to the disappearance of some files in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case of Gujarat, the BSP chief said that this also makes it clear that the central government has the right intentions in sensitive cases as well Is not working with kendriya sarkari agenciyon evam mantralayon kaa raajnneetik istemaal galat he or aisi dweshpurn raajnneeti nahin kerani chaiye
 The comments mayawati ne kaha ki iskaa ek udhaaharan hyderabad ke dalit chaatr rohit vemula ke maamle main bhi jag-jaahir ho chukaa he
 Who was tortured to such an extent that he was forced to commit suicide and could not get justice till date

 mayawati ne shuukravaar ko jari ek bayaan main kaha ki vaise to kairana se kathith palaayan ke maamle ko bhaajapa sampradayik rang dene ke saath-saath uskaa galat raajnneetik laabh uthaane ke liye kaaphi jor lagaae hue he, lekin sapa sarkaar bhi raaj dharm ko bhuulakar aise tatwon ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kar rahi he
 He said that the BSP demands that strict action should be taken immediately against those who incite the incitement
 varanaa uttar pradesh ek baar phir sampradayik dange kii aag main jalegaa jisaki puri jimmedaari sapa or uski sarkaar kii hogi
 The BSP president termed the suspension of Senior Superintendent of Police Anant Dev in the case of beating up of an SP leader at the police station in Gorakhpur as an improper step and said that the SP government has completely surrounded Jungle Raj
 aisa lagata he ki centre bhaajapa sarkaar kii tarah hi pradesh kii sapa sarkaar bhi galat, jativaadee evam pakshpaati maansikta se kaam karte huye un sabhi adhikariyon ko dandit kar rahi he jo kanoon ke anusaar nishpakshta se kaam karne kaa thodaa bhi saahas kar rahe hai
 He said that the fault of the senior superintendent of police of Gorakhpur district was that his police had tried to stop the bullying and bullying of an SP leader
 kya is prakaar ke galat kaaryon se pradesh kii kanoon-vyavastha kabhi bhi behatar ho paaegi
 Mayawati said that this is another example which shows that officers are not able to run ahead of sp's goons, miscreants, mafias, chaotic, criminal and communal elements
 gujarat ke ishrat jahaan muthbhed maamle main kuch filon ke gaayab hone se sambandhit grih mantralay kii jaanch ke bare main media main chhapi report kaa hawala dete huye basapa pramukh ne kaha ki isse bhi yah spasht ho jaataa he ki centre sarkaar samvedansheel maamalon main bhi sahi niyat se kaam nahin kar rahi he
 The political use of central government agencies and ministries is wrong and such malicious politics should not be done
 tippaniyan Mayawati said that an example of this has also come to light in the case of Hyderabad-based Dalit student Rohit Vemula
 jise is had tak pratadit kiya gaya ki use aatmahatya tak ke liye majaboor hona padaa or use aaj tak insaaf bhi nahin mil paaya

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ek baar uttar pradesh kii varanasi loksabhaa seat se siyaasi maidan main utrenge
 Narendra Modi had swept the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Kashi and eliminated the opposition parties in Purvanchal
 lekin is baar kaashi ke ran main narendra modi kii raah pichley chunaav kii tarah aasaan najar nahin aa rahi he
 The SP-BSP-RLD are trying to surround Modi by putting candidates on one side
 vahiin, congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi kii kaashi main entry ke baad raajnneetik haalat badale hue najar aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, it will be a challenge for Narendra Modi to penetrate the opposition Chakravyuh in Kashi, because along with Varanasi, the fortress of Purvanchal also rests on his shoulders
 bataa den ki narendra modi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main upi kii varanasi seat se chunavi maidan main utarkar sapa, basapa or congress kaa puri tarah se raajnneetik safaya kar diya tha
 Except the parliamentary seat of Azamgarh, the BJP was successful in feeding the lotus on all the seats of the rest of Purvanchal
 basapa or congress to apana khaataa bhi purvanchal main nahin khol saki thi
 But this time the situation of political land from Varanasi to Purvanchal has changed
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan bana chunautisapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan varanasi main narendra modi ko gherne ke liye aise main ummidavaar kii talash main hai, jo raajnneetik or jaateey sameekaran ke lihaaj se feet baithta ho
 Not only this, they are also trying to give a tough challenge to Modi, because the bail of the SP and BSP candidates in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections could not be saved
 haalanki donon partiyon ne alag-alag chunaav lade the, lekin is baar donon dalon ne gathbandhan karke maidan main utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 How BJP will face Priyanka Factor Whereas, Congress has made a big bet by making Priyanka Gandhi in charge of Purvanchal
 priyanka gandhi ne somvaar ko purvanchal ke liye loksabhaa chunaav abhiyaan kaa pehla daura prayagraj se varanasi kaa kiya he
 During this time, she reached the Ganges river with the help of a boat
 raste main wo mandir or majaar par maathaa tekte hue or ganga ke donon kinare based hue logon se samvaad karte hue kaashi pahunchin
 The political situation seems to have changed after Priyanka's entry into Varanasi
 priyanka ne jis tarah se varanasi main sidhe taur par narendra modi ko lekar gheraa or sawaal khadey kiye hai
 It is clear that the Congress has made up its mind to field a huge candidate against Modi
 aise main sabhi kii nigahen congress ke agle kadam par hai
 Varanasi's caste equation will cast votes in the seventh phase of the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat
 yahaan ke jaateey sameekaran ko dekhen to brahman, vaisya or kurmi matadaata kaaphi nirnaayak bhoomika main hai
 There are about three lakh Vaishyas, two and a half lakh Kurmis, two and a half lakh Brahmins, three lakh Muslims, 1 lakh 30 thousand Bhumihars, 1 lakh Rajputs, twenty five lakh Yadavs, 80 thousand Chaurasia, one lakh Dalits and about one lakh OBC voters
 haalanki bijepi ne anupriya patel kii apana dal (es) ke saath gathbandhan karke kurmi vot ko ek baar phir saadhane kii kavayad kii he
 In caste terms, the upper caste vote bank is considered effective in this seat
 narendra modi ke pratyaashee ho jane ke baad 2014 main jis tarah se tasviir badali, vah kisi se chuphi nahin he
 The BJP is considered a party of Vaishyas, Baniyas and traders
 haalanki is baar chunauti badi he
 One is the coalition eye on backward and Dalit voters
 congress apana dal ke duusare gut ke sahare kurmi vot bank main send lagane kii koshish main he
 He also has an eye on Brahmin and extremely backward castes
 aise main is baar ladaai utani aasaan nahin rahane vaali
 Chitragupta is considered the principal deity of Hindus

 vyapaariyon ke liye yah nae saal kii shuruyaat maani jaati he
 On this day, work is started by writing 'shri' on the new books
 is din agar chacheri, mameri, fupheri yaa koi bhi bahan apane haath se bhai ko khaanaa khilaae to uski umr bad jaati he
 Along with this, the sufferings of life also go away
 bhaiyadooj ke din kysth samaaj chitragupta kii puja karte hai
 Chitragupta Puja can be performed from 6:35 am to 7:30 pm and Lekhani worship can be done from 11:45 am to 1:30 pm
 chitragupta kii puja karne kii vidhi bhi bahut aasaan he
 
 
 Clean the place of worship and place a cloth and place a picture of Chitragupta
 - deepak jala kar ganesh ji ko chandan, roli, haldi, akshat laga kar puja karen
 - Offer Chitragupta ji by applying sandalwood, roli, turmeric, Akshat
 - iske baad fal,mithai,paan supaari or doodh, ghi, adarak, gud or gangaajal se bane panchamrita kaa bhoga lagaaein

 Environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday used the famous song of the film 'taj Mahal' to shake the rich countries in Paris, 'you have to fulfill what you promised
 
 
 
 Javadekar said that wherever disasters like Chennai occur and where the impact of climate change can be reduced, there should be compensation to such countries in the world
 abhi iske liye koi maikenism nahin he or jo hua wo aadha-adhuraa he
 The question arising here in Paris is whether climate change is responsible for the devastation and destruction in Chennai? Experts are saying that such incidents are the result of climate change and this is due to global warming which is mainly due to the carbon spread in the atmosphere by the US and European countries
 paris main chal rahe jalwaayu parivartan sammelan main is baat ko lekar ladaai tej ho gai he
 While the US and the European Union are asking poor and developing countries not to ask for money for loss and damage, India has also clearly told the rich countries that at least in terms of climate finance, countries like America fulfill their promise Will have to do it and this time the false console will not work
 sach ye he ki ek ore lagaataar garam ho rahi dharti kii vajah se prakritik aapadaaen aa rahi hai, vahiin duusari ore bharat jaise deshon ne iske liye koi khaas taiyaari nahin kii he
 To deal with this, a lot of money is needed, which is being demanded from rich countries
 jaankaar kehete hai ki bharat muaavje kii maang ko lekar kaaphi gambhir he or isiilie pradhanmantri narendra modi ne yahaan apane bhaashan main iskaa zikr bhi kiya tha
 But the rich countries in Paris are telling a different story

 The question arising here in Paris is whether climate change is responsible for the devastation and destruction in Chennai? Experts are saying that such incidents are the result of climate change and this is due to global warming which is mainly due to the carbon spread in the atmosphere by the US and European countries
 paris main chal rahe jalwaayu parivartan sammelan main is baat ko lekar ladaai tej ho gai he
 While the US and the European Union are asking poor and developing countries not to ask for money for loss and damage, India has also clearly told the rich countries that at least in terms of climate finance, countries like America fulfill their promise Will have to do it and this time the false console will not work
 sach ye he ki ek ore lagaataar garam ho rahi dharti kii vajah se prakritik aapadaaen aa rahi hai, vahiin duusari ore bharat jaise deshon ne iske liye koi khaas taiyaari nahin kii he
 To deal with this, a lot of money is needed, which is being demanded from rich countries
 jaankaar kehete hai ki bharat muaavje kii maang ko lekar kaaphi gambhir he or isiilie pradhanmantri narendra modi ne yahaan apane bhaashan main iskaa zikr bhi kiya tha
 But the rich countries in Paris are telling a different story
 unka kahana he ki vikasshil deshon ko chennai jaisi kisi aapadaa ke liye koi muaavja maangane kaa adhikaar nahin he

 The truth is that on the one hand, natural disasters are coming due to the constantly warming earth, on the other hand, countries like India have not made any special preparations for this
 isse nibatane ke liya dher sara paisa chahie, jisaki maang amir deshon se kii ja rahi he
 Experts say that India is very serious about the demand for compensation and that is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned it in his speech here
 lekin paris main amir desh kuch or hi kahani kah rahe hai
 He says that developing countries do not have the right to ask for compensation for a disaster like Chennai
 ection aid ke antarashtriya niti prabandhak harjit singh kehete hai, 'ye jo aapadaaen ho rahi hai wo climet change kii vajah se ho rahi hai
 How do we prepare them? 
 
 jisamen ham baat karte hai arli warning system kii yaa logon ko nikaalane kaa plan banane kii
 There is an issue in this loss and damage which means these devastations are happening, like we have seen in Uttarakhand in Chennai or seen in Odisha
 
 
 uske liye muaavja maanga ja rahaa he
 This is causing trouble to these countries, because they know that the matter is going to go into several billion dollars

 amir desh apane kiye kaa bhugtan karen
 Javadekar said that for India, it is a question of the life and death of one and a quarter billion people and therefore if the rich and developed countries get away from the spirit of agreement then it will not be acceptable to India at all

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on Tuesday that he advocates for enactment of the Prevention of Communal Violence Act, but for this it should not be enough at the administrative level, but at the political level with the states

 nitish ne kaha ki ham logon ne apni raay rakhi thi ki sampradayik hinsa rokane ke liye ek upyukt kanoon bananaa chahie
 We are its advocates and to enact this law properly, there should be political discussion with the states
 prashasnic str par vimarsh prayaapt nahin
 He said that unless there is provision in this bill that the states which do not curb communal violence, then declare that area as disturbed area and the center will intervene directly through its central forces through communal there Control violence
