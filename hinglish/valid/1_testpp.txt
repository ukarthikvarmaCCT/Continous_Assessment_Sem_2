 Sense: Foolish people often argue about how this creation was created, by whose will it was made, by which things it was made, etc
 unka uddeshy logon main bhranti paidaa karne ke alaava kuch nahin he

 log apni ruchi ke anusaar koi ek maarg ko pasand karte he
 But ultimately, all these routes, as the water of different rivers flows and gets into the sea, similarly, reaches you

 Finally, admitting your defeat, he praised you, which pleased you and revealed your original form

 Charity: With your supreme devotion, Ravana became the master of unmatched force, but what did he want to do with it? To save the labor of going to Kailash everyday for your worship, Kailash wanted to raise and bury him in Lanka
 jab kailash uthaane ke liye ravan ne apni bhujaaon ko failaayaa tab parvati bhaybheet ho uthin
 To relieve them, you just shook your toe, then Ravana went and fell into the puddle and there was no place for him

 The simple logarithm of the ratio between the maximum amplitude of the ground and the random small amplitude at the time of an earthquake is called the 'richter scale'
 richter paimaane kaa vikaas 1930 ke dashak main kiya gaya tha
 From 1970 onwards, 'moment magnitude') was used in place of the Richter scale for the measurement of earthquake intensity
 'riktar paimaane' kaa puraa naam richter pariman pareekshan paimaana he or laghu rup main ise sthanik pariman likhte hai
 This scale is represented by a number to measure the amount of geological energy emitted from an earthquake

 Being well aware of these dangers, some countries have introduced the concept of alternative service, in which military services are used in addition to military operations and sometimes even outside the military, such as 'sivilipavelas' in Finland, Austria And 'zivildienst' in Switzerland

 The Leafs are believed to have been the first European to step on North America, 500 years before Chrysotofer Columbus
 "sagas off islanders" ke anusaar, unhone ne vinland me ek upnivesh ki sthapana kii, jise aaj neufoundland dweep me launs o medo ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Leaf is believed to have been born in Iceland, circa 970
 ve pita erik da redor mata theotakhild ke putr the
 Eric the Red himself was an explorer and founded the first Norwegian colony in Greenland
 leef ke do bete the, thurgills or thorakel
 Leaf was the son of father Eric the Red and mother Thyotkhild and grandson of Thorwald Aswaldsson
 haalaa ki sagas off islanders main leef kaa janmasthan nahin diya gaya he, leef kaa janm sambhavatya island ke brikeafurthur me hua tha
 Leaf had two brothers, Thorsten and Thorwald, and a sister, Fredis
 thorwald asawaldsan ko norve se hatya ke liye nirvasit kiya gaya tha, or ve yuva erik ke sang nirvaasan me island chale gayi
 When Eric himself was deported from Iceland, he traveled west and established the first Norwegian settlement in Greenland in 986 AD
 san 999 may leef or unke saathiyon ne greenland se norve tak jalayatra kii
 On reaching Norway, he became the herdman of King Olaf Trigwasan
 unhone isai dharm apana liya or unhen greenland me is dharm kaa vistaar karne kaa kaary saunpa gaya
 "sagas of Eric the Red" and "sagas of Greenlanders" have different descriptions of Leaf's journey to Vinland
 vinland kii charchaa keval do aitihaasik lekhon me hui he, ari da wiz kii 1122 me likhi gai pustak, islandinkabok, env adam off breman ke lekh main
 According to the "sagas of Greenlanders", the Leafs first saw Vineland when he was going from Greenland to expand Norway Christianity and wandered on his journey
 inaar hougan kaa "voyajes tu vinland" ke anuwaad ke shabdic vyakhya anusaar, leef erikson ese pehle vyakti nahi the jinhone uttari america ko dekha tha
 Leif had heard Byrne Harjolfsson's claims that he had also seen a land west of Greenland
 tathaapi, byarni ne kathith rup se kabhi uttari america par kadam nahi rakhaa tha
 Later, while the Leafs were traveling from Norway to Greenland, they wandered the way to an island in North America where they found "spontaneously grown wheat and grape fields"
 us dweep se unhone do agyaat vyaktiyon ko bachaaya or waapas greenland chale gayi
 As a result, if it were to be trusted, Byrne was the first European to see North America and those two unknown people were the first Europeans to step on that continent
 leef ne fir byarni kaa jahaaz kharida, 35 navikon kaa dal ikattha kiya or byarni ke dwaara varnit bhoomi kii ore chale gayi
 Eriksen followed the path of Byrne in an instant and reached a deserted rocky place, which he named Helluland
 thodi si yatra ke pashchaat, vah ek vanachhadit ilaake me pahuch gayi, jiskaa naam unhone marculand rakhaa
 Eventually, the Leafs reached Vineland
 yahan par unhone ek chote upnivesh kii sthapana kii, jise greenland ke aagantukon ne lifsbudir kaa naam diya
 He returned to Greenland after spending winter in Vinland

 The place is believed to be today known as Laughs o Meadow, the leafsbudir described in "voyages to Vineland" and other books
 iganstad ne yah dikhaaya ki norwagian or islandik log christopher columbus se 500 saal pehle uttari america pahuch gayi the
 Subsequent archaeological evidence suggests that Vineland was located in areas around the Gulf of St
 Lawrence, and the Louns o Meadow was a ship repair and resting place for other voyages
 sagas off erik da red me do or sthanon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he -straumphyord or hope
 Both are located south of Vineland
 leef ek shaktishaalee, gyani, or vichaarsheel vyakti bataaye jate he
 While the Leafs stayed in Hebrides, they married Thoraguna, who gave birth to Leif's son Thorgillas
 thurgills ko baad me leef ke paas greenland bhej diya gaya, parantu wo prasiddhta praapt nahi kar paaya
 After a trip to Vinland, the Leafs came back to Greenland to expand Christianity
 erik ne isaai dharm ko nahi apanaaya, par theotakhild ne is dharm ko apanaaya or "theotakhild carch" kii sthapana kii
 The last surviving mention of the leaf is in 1019 and in 1025, the son of Leif, Thorkel was given the title of Erikford
 dharawahikon me lif ki mrityu kaa vivaran nahi kiya gaya he-unki mrityu 1019 or 1025 ke bich me hui thi
 Following the successful Leaf's expedition, other Norwegian explorers were also encouraged to travel
 norse or uttari america ke swadeshi logon ke bich pehali baar spasht sampark leef ke bhai thorwald dwaara hui thi, jiskaa ant hatya or shatruta me hua
 Ultimately, no permanent colony was established in Vinland, but campaigns for wood, provisions and trade continued for centuries
 in kshetron ke bare me aakasmik swaron se pataa chalata he ki samakalinon in abhiyaanon ko adhik mahatv nahi diya, yaa phir yah saarvajanik gyaan tha
 Knowledge of these campaigns probably spread to medieval Europe, and it is possible that Chrysotofer Columbus had heard of these campaigns

 iran kaa purana naam faras he or iskaa itihaas bahut hi naatakeey rahaa he jisamen iske pados ke kshetra bhi shaamil rahe hai
 The story of empires in Iranian history begins with the Hakhamani rulers 600 years before Christ
 inke dwaara pashchim asia tathaa misr par isapurv 530 ke dashak main hui vijay se lekar atharahavin sadi main nadirshah ke bharat par akraman karne ke bich main kai samrajyon ne faras par shashan kiya
 Some of them belonged to the Persian cultural region and some were outsiders
 farsi saskruthik prabhaav vaale kshetron main aadhunik iran ke alaava iraq kaa dakshini bhaag, azarbaijan, pashchimi afghanistan, tajikistan kaa dakshini bhaag or purvi turki bhi shaamil hai
 All these are the areas where the Persian Sasakas once ruled and due to which the influence of Persian culture was influenced by them
 saatvin sadi main iran main islam aayaa
 Earlier Iran had followers of Zardosht's religion
 iran shiya islam kaa kendra mana jaataa he
 Some people refused to accept Islam, they were tortured
 inamen se kuch log bhaag kar bharat ke gujarat tat par aa gaye
 They still live in India and are called Parsis
 soofivaad kaa janm or vikaas iran or sambandhit kshetron main 11veen sadi ke aasapaas hua
 The Sunni caliphs of Damascus and Baghdad ruled Iran's Shia population for some 900 years, the effect of which can be seen on today's arab-iran relations
 solahavin sadi ke aarambh main safavi vansh ke turk mul logon ke satta main aane ke baad hi shiya log satta main aa sake
 Even after this, the country was ruled by the Sunnis and those rulers include Nadir Shah and some Afghan rulers
 aupniveshak daur main iran par kisi europea shakti ne sidhaa shashan to nahin kiya par angrezon tathaa roosiyon ke bich iran ke vyapaar main dakhal padaa
 Iran's political situation has been very volatile since the 1979 Islamic Revolution
 iraq ke saath yuddh ne bhi desh ko islamic jagat main ek alag jagah par laa khadaa kiya he
 It is believed that the first Palaeolithic people lived in Iran
 yahan par maanav nivas ek lakh saal purana ho saktaa he
 Cultivation started around 5000 BC
 mesopotamia kii sabhyataa ke sthal ke purv main maanav bastiyon ke hone ke pramaan mili hai
 The Iranians came from north and east around 2000 BCE
 inhone yahan ke logon ke saath ek mishrit samskruti kii aadharshila rakhi jisase iran ko uski pahchaan mili
 Modern Iran developed on this culture
 ye yaayavar log irani bhashaa bolte the or dhire dhire inhone krishi karnaa aarambh kiya
 Many branches of Aryans came to Iran
 inamen se kuch midi, kuch parthian, kuch farsi, kuch sogdi to kuch anya naamon se jane gaye
 Midi and Persians are mentioned in Assyrian sources around 836 BC
 lagbhag isi samay zarathustra kaa kaal mana jaataa he
 However, according to many people and Iranian folklore, zodiac was simply a myth, not a real man
 par chaahe jo ho usee samay ke aasapaas uske dharm kaa prachaar us puure pradesh main hua
 The Shah of Assyria gained dominion over Israel around 720 BC
 usne yahudiyon ko apane dharm ke kaaran yatnaayen di
 Their Solomon Temple was razed and many Jews were removed and settled in Medi territories
 530 isapurv ke aasapaas babylon kaa kshetra farsi niyantran main aa gaya
 Shah Artekhshatra of Persia allowed the Jews to re-adopt their religion and many Jews returned to Israel
 is dauraan jo yahudee midi main rahe unpar zaradosht ke dharm kaa bahut asar padaa or iske baad yahudee dharm main kaafii parivartan aayaa
 This sequence of Zoroastrians is mentioned in the old Bible text
 is samay tak faras midi samrajya kaa ang or sahaayak rahaa tha
 But around 549 BC, a Persian prince, Cyrus, rebelled against the king of Meidi
 usne midi raja astiaz ko padchyut kar rajdhani ekbatanaa par niyantran kar liya
 He established the Hakhamani dynasty and overturned the relations of Medea and Persia
 ab faras satta kaa kendra or midia uskaa sahaayak ban gaya
 But Kurosh did not stop here
 usne ledia, asia miner ke pradeshon par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 His empire spread from the west coast of Turkey to Afghanistan
 uske putr kambojia ne samrajya ko misr tak failaa diya
 This was followed by several revolts, and then Dara i seized power
 usne dharmik sahishnutaa kaa maarg apanaaya
 However, Darush, according to the Greek historian Herodotus, tried his best to get the support of the youth
 usne sires yaa cambases kii tarah koi khaas sainik safalataa to arjeet nahin kii par usne 512 isaapurv ke aasapaas europe main apana sainya abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 Then the son Khashyarsha became the ruler known for his rebellion and Greek campaigns on the Egypt and Babylonian revolts
 usne athens tathaa sparta ke raja ko haraaya
 He killed King Leonadus of Sparta in the Battle of Thermopylae but also greatly damaged the Persian army
 unani kathaon ke anusaar 300 logon kii ek sainya tukdi ne farsi sena ko kai dinon tak aage badhane se roke rakhaa or bahut nuksaan bhi pahunchaaya
 He later captured Athens in the Acropolis and burned it
 baad main use salaamis ke paas haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa jiske baad uski sena ko or bhi pradesh haarane pade
 Artexerexes, son of Xerxes, succeeded the throne in 465 BC
 usne visthaparat yahudiyon ko apana mandir phir se banane kii ijazat di
 Followed by Artexerexes II, then Artexrexes III and then Dara III
 daara tritiy ke samay tak farsi sena kaafii sangathit ho gai thi
 The cavalry became more numerous in the army and military skills also increased
 par isi samay mesidonia main sikandar kaa udai ho rahaa tha
 In 334 BC Alexander attacked Asia Minor
 daara ko bumadhya sagar ke tat par isus main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 After this, Alexander defeated Dara three times
 sikandar isaapurv 330 main percepolis aayaa or uske fatah ke baad usne shahar ko jala dene kaa aadesh diya
 Alexander invaded India in 326 AD and then returned
 323 isaapurv ke aasapaas, babylon main uski mrityu ho gai
 After his death, his generals divided the conquered Persian empire among themselves
 sikandar ke sabase kaabil senapatiyon main se ek tha celucus
 He had control over Mesopotamia and the Iranian plateau regions
 lekin isi samay se uttar purv main parthiyon kaa vidroh aarambh ho gaya tha
 The Parthians also plagued the Hakhamani rulers
 parthiyanon ne pashchim main romanon kaa samana kiya or purv main shakon ko
 In this, his rule was often turbulent
 mitradets ne isapurv 123 se isapurv 87 tak apekshaakrit sthayitv se shashan kiya
 The Mitradates defeated Cresus, the governor of Roman Syria, in the Battle of Kärhe
 is yuddh main cresus ne parthiyanon ke senapati suren ke saath samjhauta karne kii bhi koshish kii, par uskaa ant sir katane ke baad hui
 The character of Suren is probably later immortalized by the Persian poet Firdausi in his treatise Shahnama by the name Rustom in the tenth century
 rustam na sirf ek bahadur senapati tha balki ek bhavuk premi bhi
 At the time of the assassination of Julius Caesar, the Parthians occupied some Roman territories, including the Middle East
 agle kuch saalon tak shashan kii bagdor to parthiyanon ke haath hi rahi par unka netritv or samast irani kshetron par unki pakad dhili hi rahi
 Over the next few years, there were many wars of the Parians with the Romans, in which Parthians had to face defeat many times, but at the same time they gave birth to an indo-parthian culture in Punjab formerly known as Pahlavis
 iske baad faras kii satta par kisi ekmaatr shaasha kaa prabhutv nahin rahaa
 Although the Romans never increased their influence before the Dzala River, the Persian rulers remained subdued compared to the Romans
 par teesri sadi ke baad se saasaani shakti main uttarottar vruddhi hui
 Ardashir i founded this dynasty in 224 by defeating the Parthian ruler Ardavan
 unhone roman samrajya ko chunauti di or kai saalon tak unpar akraman karte rahe
 In 241, Shapur defeated the Romans in the Battle of Misico
 244 isvi tak armenia farsi niyantran main aa gaya
 Apart from this, the Parthians troubled the Romans in many places, Shapur died in 273 AD
 san 283 main romanon ne farsi kshetron par phir se akraman kar diya
 As a result, Armenia was divided into two parts - Roman control and Persian control
 shapur ke putron ko or bhi samjhaute karne pade or kuch or kshetra romanon ke niyantran main chale gaye
 In 310, Shapur II ascended the throne in his youth
 usne 379 isvi tak shashan kiya
 His rule remained relatively calm
 usne dharmik sahishnutaa kii niti apanaai
 His successors adopted the same peaceful foreign policy but they lacked military strength
 ardshir dwitiya, shapur tritiy tathaa baharaam chaturth sabhi sandigdh avasthaa main maare gaye
 His heir Yazdegard kept peace with the Romans
 uske shasankaal main romanon ke saath sambandh itane shantipurna ho gaye ki purvi roman samrajya ke shaasha arcadius ne yazdegard ko apane bete kaa abhibhavak bana diya
 After that Bahram became the fifth ruler who was fond of hunting wild animals
 wo 438 isvi ke aasapaas ek junglee khel dekhte vakt laapata ho gaya jiske baad uske bare main kuch pataa nahin chal sakaa
 In the chaos that followed, Kavad i became ruler in 488 CE
 iske baad khusro, hormuzd chaturth, khusro dwitiya tathaa yajdegard tritiy kaa shashan aayaa
 He was only 8 years old when Yazgard took over power
 isi samay arab, mohammad sahab ke netritv main kaaphi shaktishaalee ho gaye the
 In 634 he defeated the Bezantines near Gaza in a decisive battle
 farsi samrajya par bhi unhone akraman kiye the par ve utane safal nahin rahe the
 In 641 he defeated Yazdegard near Hamadan, after which he ran for help on the east, but he died in Merv by his own people in 651 AD
 iske baad arabon kaa prabhutv badhata gaya
 He captured Khorasan in 654 and Balkh till 707 AD
 mohammad sahab kii mrityu ke uparaant unke vaaris ko calipha kaha jaataa tha jo islam kaa pramukh mana jaataa tha
 The fourth Khalifa Ali was a Farik of Muhammad Sahab and the husband of his daughter Fatimah
 par unke khilaafat ko chunauti di gai or vidroh bhi hue
 Ali was assassinated in 661
 iske baad ummayadon kaa prabhutv islam par ho gaya
 In 680, Ali's second son Husain rebelled against the Ummayds in Karbala, but he was killed in a battle
 isi din kii yaad main shiya musalmaan mahurram manaate hai
 By this time, Islam was divided into two camps - the Ummayad camp and Ali's camp
 jo ummayadon ko islam ke vaastavik uttaradhikari samajhate the ve sunni kahalaaye or jo ali ko vaastavik khalipha maanate the ve shiya | san 740 main ummayadon ko turkon se munh kii khaani padi
 In the same year, a Persian convert - Abu Muslim - prepared a large public against the Ummayds in the name of Muhammad Sahib's dynasty
 unhone san 749-50 ke bich ummayadon ko haraa diya or ek nayaa khaliph ghoshit kiya - abul abbaas
 Abul Abbas was not a descendant of Ali and Hussain, but a descendant of another Farik of Muhammad Sahab
 usase abu muslim kii badhati lokapriyata dekhi nahin gai or usko 755 isvi main phaansi par lataka diya
 The incident is considered an important day in Shia Islam as Ali's supporters were once again marginalized
 abul abbaas ke vanshajon ne kai sadiyon tak raaj kiya
 His dynasty was called Abbasi dynasty and he established his capital in Baghdad
 unka shashan arab or pashchim asian sena tathaa farsi sahitya ke prabhaav ke sammilman se bana
 Iranians made many unforgettable contributions of science, medicine and astrology to the Arabic language, mainly in the Arabic language
 dasvin sadi main pashchim asia ke irani mul ke buvaai shaskaon ne baghdad par akraman kar use haraa diya or is tarah abbasi kilaafat kii shreshthata par viraam laga diya
 In 920, the Samani Empire emerged in Khorasan, north-eastern Persia
 samaani shaskaon ne farsi bhashaa ke vikaas ke prayaas kiye
 This was the first time since the advent of Islam that a ruler encouraged the development of the Iranian language
 uttar se saljuk turk or uttarpurv se gaznavi shaskaon ne iran par kuch samay ke liye aanshik rup se adhikaar kiya
 In the thirteenth century, Baghdad collapsed following the invasion of the then-unmanned Mongols, and Iran again witnessed political chaos for a few years
 dedh sau saalon ke baad iran main taimur langs kaa bhi akraman hua
 During this time poetry and Sufi ideology developed a lot
 abbasid kaal main iran kii pramukh ghatnaon main se ek thi sufi andolan kaa vikaas
 Although the Sufi movement originated in the Arab and Iraq regions, it got its full form in Iran
 sufi ve log the jo dharmik kattarta ke shikaar the or saral jivan pasand karte tha
 This period gave birth to unprecedented poets in the Persian language
 rudaaki, firdausi, umr khayyam, nasir-e-khusro, rumi, iraqi, saadi, hafeez aadi us kaal ke prasiddh kavi hue jisamen kaiyon ko soofivaad ke preneta ke rup main jaataa jaataa he
 Persian poetry of this period has been called the world's best poem in many places
 rudaaki tathaa firdausi ko uttar purv main koraasaan ke samaani tathaa gaznavi shaskaon kii farsi sahitya protsaahan ke phaayde mili
 Firdausi's Shahnama is known as the book of glorifying the rulers of pre-islam Iran which reduced the use of Arabic words contained in the colloquial Persian of that period
 baad ke shaayaron ne haalanki arabi bhashaa ke shabdon se parhez nahin kiya or terahavin sadi tak arabi shabd farsi ke ang ban gaye
 Rumi, Iraqi and Saadi were born in the 1210s and Hafiz a century later
 aaj bhi iraniyon main is kaal kaviyon ke prati bahut adarbhav he
 Many of these poets were steeped in Sufi ideology and apart from Abbasi rule, many had to suffer or see the oppression of Mongols
 haafiz ke samay taimur langs ke akraman se faras pareshaan tha
 In the fifteenth century, when the Mongol power began to wane, an army of Lash from the Ottoman cavalry arose in the northwest of Iran
 iske mul ke bare main matbhed he par unhone saafavi vansh kii sthapana kii
 They became Shia and ruled the Iranian territory and territories dominated by Persia for many centuries to come
 is samay shiya islam bahut phala phula
 After the Afghan and Eastern rebellions of 1720, the Safavis gradually declined
 afagaanon ne safaavi rajdhani isiahaan par kabja kar liya or shah abbaas or uske putr tahmaasya ko kaid kar liya
 The Thamasya managed to escape but the Afghans controlled Isfahan
 san 1729 main nadir coli ne afagaanon ke prabhutv ko kam kiya
 He started his life with poverty and did not become the Shah of Persia, but he pulled out the powerful enemy Osmani Empire and the Russian Empire from Iranian territories at that time
 vah ek turk tha par usne safaviyon ko pashchim kii ore se aakraant automan turkon ke kilaaf madad di
 This enabled him to occupy a high position in the army of the defunct Safavis
 taimur langs ko apana adarsh maane vaala nadir coli afashari kabale kaa tha or uskaa jivan uski sainya uplabdhiyon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Nadir was granted the title of Coolie Tapamasya by Safawi Shah Thamasya in exchange for the Afghans to flee the capital, Isfahan, after which he became a respected figure in the Safavid court
 iske baad usne afagaanon or osmanon ko shant kiya or bharat par bhi akraman kiya 
 After defeating Mongol Shah Alam, someone brought from there a wealth of 70 crore rupees, including Kohinoor diamond
 iske alaava usne bhayankar markat bhi machaai
 Urdu poet Mir Taki Mir of that time described Delhi before and after the invasion, which shows how much destruction was caused by Nadir Koli in Delhi
 bharat se lautne par use pataa chalaa ki uske bet raza coli, jise usne apni anupasthiti main samrajya dekharekh karne kaa jimmaa saunp ke gaya tha, ne faras kii gaddi par baithe shah tahmaasya kii hatya kar di he
 By that time, Nadir did not become Koli Shah but was the commander of the Persian Empire
 1736 main wo shah bana 
 After this he went to crush Dagestan's rebellion, where the failure failed to persecute him
 iske alaava jab use ye soochna kuch saradaaron se mili ki raza use bhi maarane kaa shadyantra rach rahaa he to usne raza ko andhaa kar diya
 Later, when he finds out that Raza is innocent, he is very sorry and angry at the warlords who blinded him
 usne unhen maarane kaa aadesh de diya lekin phir bhi use apane par bahut gussa aayaa or uske swabhaav main parivartan aane laga
 He became cruel and cruel as well as weak and sick
 pashchim main osmanon ke khilaaf bhi wo adhik safal nahin ho paaya or 1746 main kiye ek samjhaute main use nazaf tak se santosh karnaa padaa
 He was assassinated in 1747
 uske marane ke baad uskaa samrajya adhik dinon tak nahin tik sakaa
 But he is remembered for keeping the empire undivided in the difficult circumstances of that time
 kuch dinon baad kazar vansh kaa shashan aayaa par us samay iran ke tel kshetron kii khoj hone or iske osmani, bhartiya or roosi kshetron ke bich sthit hone ke kaaran roosi, angrejon or francisi samrajyon kaa prabhaav badhata hi gaya
 Russia from the north, France from the west and Britain from the east fell on Persia
 san 1905-1911 main europea prabhaav bad jane or shah kii niskriyata ke khilaaf ek janandolan hua
 Tension persisted over Iran's oil fields
 pratham vishwayuddh main turki ke parajeet hone ke baad iran ko bhi uskaa fal bhugatna padaa
 It is said that during the Second World War, in view of the presence of German Nazis, the people from Britain and Russia had indirectly seized power over Iran, but nothing happened on paper
 raja shah ne 1930 ke dashak main iran kaa aadhunikeekaran prarambh kiya
 But he could not succeed like his inspirational Turkish Kamal Pasha
 usne shiksha ke liye abhootpurv bandobast kiye tathaa sena ko sugathit kiya
 He reduced the influence of religion in the work of the country like Kamal Pasha of Turkey
 kattar islamiyon ko jail yaa desh nikaala kii sazaa di gai
 Ayatollah Khomeini lived under this, first in Iraq, then Istanbul and then in Paris
 uske baad 1979 main ek or aandolan hua jiskaa kaaran dharmik tha
 This resulted in the decline of the Pahlavi dynasty and Ayatollah Khomeini gained power
 unka dehanth 1989 main hua
 During his reign, he had to issue a fatwa against the writer Salman Rushdie under Islamic influence
 iske baad se iran main videshi prabhutv lagbhag samaapt ho gaya
 At present, strict Islamic rules are in force in Iran and women are forced to wear hijab
 hanlaanki tel se paise aa jane kii vajah se shaharon main janajivan vilasita purna he par islamic kanoon ke sakht daayre ke bheetar rahakar
 President Ahmadi Nizad is under intense international pressure to stop his nuclear program
 america sahit kai deshon ne aarthik pratibandh lagane shuru kar diye hai or israyal sainik kaarywahi kii dhamkee de rahaa he
 Media favoritism refers to the partiality of journalists and news producers
 media pakshpaat report kii jane vaali ghatnaon evam kahaniyon ke chunaav ke rup main ho saktaa he yaa uski prastuti ke rup main bhi ho saktaa he
 Scholars of media-studies believe that mass media's conceptual origins are propaganda
 solahavin sadi main catholic mat ke jisut anuyaayiyon ne protestanton dwaara kii jane vaali aalochana ke jawaab main latin bhashaa ke shabd ‘propaganda’ se nikalne vaale taatparyon ke aadhaar par dharm-sudhaar virdohi vichaardhaaratmak muhim chalaai thi
 The understanding behind this was that people do not imbibe any message until it is given to them again and again
 attharahavin sadi ke europee gyanoday ke baad bani paristhitiyon main sandesh-rachana kii prakriya main parivartan hua, kyonki uske baad uttarottar votaron, upabhoktaaon or darshakon kii dilchaspiyon kaa dhyaan rakhana zaruri hota chalaa gaya
 The modern state took the priority of educating and training the common citizens, except for the censorship imposed under exceptional circumstances of foreign invasion
 media kii swa-ghoshit tatasthta yahan rajya ke kaam aayi
 Governments and national elite achieved great success by putting media in the project of nation and state-building by creating a national consensus instead of government machinery
 chunki maas-media bahut bade paimaane par prachaar- saamagree kaa utpaadan manoranjan, samachar, vishleshan, vigyaapan or samvadaparak charchaaon ke madhyam se kar saktaa he, isliye beesvin sadi main isaki propaganda sambandhi kshamtaaon kaa dohan karne ke liye corporate jagat, raashtra-rajya or raajnneetik vichaardhaaraon ke pairokaron ne khuli or chhipi tarkiben viksit kii hai
 Pragmatism is argued from the media that not all facts and events can be broadcast, so some of them have to be selected and some have to be released
 chayan or chhantai kii is prakriya se hi pakshpaat kaa janm hota he or purv-nirdhaarit sahmati gadhane main madad milti he
 Emphasis is placed on select facts to appease the advertisers, to serve the interests of the media-owners, not to hurt the perceived sentiments of the majority or minorities, and to reinforce the dominant ideology of the nation-state 
 media-pakshpaat ke dharmik, nasli, langik, ayuparak, sexual, jatigat or jaateeytavaadi ayaamon ko bhi rekhaankit kiya gaya he
 Everyone knows that the media is biased, but it is a difficult task to characterize this attitude and criticize it in detail
 pakshpaat ke aarope ke jawaab main media ke pairokaar aksar poochhate hai ki kya kisi ghatana kii repotag karne gayi samvaadadaata dwaara donon pakshon dwaara apane-apane haq main kii gayi baton ko silsilewar pesh kar dena hi nishpaksh patrakarita he? ye log kehete hai ki ‘balanced’ repotag kaa matlab hota he ridhhin or dharhin patrakarita
 It is obvious that this argument does not consider neutrality as absurd and 'commitment' as 'partiality'
 agar media apni pakshadharata ko chhipaane kii koshish nahin kar rahaa he, to uske ekatarfaapan ko uski quality ke rup main grahan kiya ja saktaa he
 However, if an attempt is being made to forge a certain kind of consensus under the guise of neutrality, detailed studies are needed to detect and then reveal it
 2004 main kiye gayi ek adhyayan ke mutabik media-pakshpaat kii toh lene ke liye baarah tareeke istemaal kiye ja sakate hai : patrakaron, media-abhijanon or patrakarita ke chaatro ke raajnneetik / saanskrithik drushtikonon kaa surveykshan kiya ja saktaa he; patrakaron ke puraane peshevraana samparkon par nazar daali ja sakati he; pramukh patrakaron kii raajnneetik aasthaaon kaa udghaatan karne vaale uddhran jamaa kiye ja sakate hai; computer ke zariye kii-vards kaa istemaal karke media-saamagree ke saar or shrenee kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he; news stories dwaara suzaayi gayi nitiyon kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he; kisi ghatana ke nakaaratmak / sakaaratmak kawarej ko rekhaankit kiya ja saktaa he; media ke un logon ke kariyar par nigaah phenki ja sakati he jinke haath main nirnayakari adhikaar hote hai; soochna / manoranjan-saamagree ko prabhavit karne vaale vigyaapan- sroton kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he; media par sarkari propegande or jan-sampark udyog ke asar par dhyaan diya ja saktaa he, media dwaara tikaa-tippanee ke liye chune gayi visheshgyon or pravaktaaon ko un hit-samoohon or vichaardhaara-pairokaron ke barakes rakh kar dekha ja saktaa he jinhen media nahin chunata; or corporeshnon or vaanijya associationon dwaara patrakaron ko kiye gayi bhaashan vagairah dene ke badale kiye gayi bhugtanon par nigaah daali ja sakati he
 The Glasgow Media Group study has been well-known in analyzing media advocacy in an attempt to find out how TV and newspapers serve corporate interests against the workers' movement
 is adhyayan par bhi pakshadharata kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he ki vah media dwaara mazaduron ke bare main istemaal kii gayi jin abhivyaktiyon ko apmanjanak qaraar detaa he, vah darasal mazaduron dwaara varnit aatmachavi se hi lee gayi hai
 a well-known study establishing a clear connection between the media and propaganda is the result of Noam Chomsky's efforts to show how US corporate powers used filters of 'anti-communist ideology' to hurt the credibility of independent media
 Huh
 duusari taraf, viksit deshon ke media par kiye gayi adhyayanon se nateeja niklaa he ki vah aam taur par anudaarataavaadi vichaar ke mukaable udaarataavaadi vichaardhaara kaa paksh letaa he
 a 1986 study on media-elite revealed the fact that the newsrooms of big newspapers and broadcast networks, such as the New York Times and Washington Post, dominated the left-hand liberal trends
 saamaajik or raajnneetik vivaadon ke bare main patrkaar or vishleshak aam taur se jo ravaiya apanaate hai us par unke nijee vichaaron kii gahari chhap hoti he
 Media-bias and the Indian media have not been equated with the West
 azaadi se pehle puraa bhartiya media do dhruvon main banta hua tha
 All the major newspapers in English openly supported the colonial rule and the media of Indian languages, without exception, stood in favor of the national movement
 ise ‘pakshpaat’ or ‘pakshadharata’ ke bich kiye ja sakane vaale fark kii misaal samajha ja saktaa he
 The English media changed overnight to the national media as soon as the transfer of power took place on August 15 in 1947
 iske baad kamobesh assi ke dashak ke ant tak bharat ke saamaajik-raajnneetik aadhunikeekaran or vaikasik arthshaastra par aadhaarit mishrit arthnitiyon ke model kaa rasta saafe karne ke liye bani rashtriya sahmati main media ke sabhi pahaluon ne apane-apane tarah se yogadan kiya
 In the nineties, there were new polarizations in Indian politics and society around the emerging forces of the temple, the temple and the market, which dissolved that national consensus
 media ke vibhinn hisse kabhi pakshadharata or kabhi pakshpaat kaa ravaiya apanaate hue samay-samay par in shaktiyon kaa samarthan or virodh karne lage
 The situation today is that the Indian media is almost without exception favoring economic reforms and globalization
 media ne ise nayi rashtriya sahmati ke rup main grahan kar liya he

 mimasaasutra, bhartiya darshan ke sabase mahatvapurn granthon main se ek he
 Its author is Maharishi Jaimini
 ise purvamimasaasutra bhi kehete hai
 Its creation is believed to be from 300 BCE to 200 BCE
 mimasaasutra, mimasaa darshan kaa aadharbhoot granth he
 According to the tradition, sage Jaimini is considered a disciple of Maharishi Veda Vyasa
 mimasaasutra kaa 'purvamimasaa' tathaa veydant kaa 'uttarmimasaa' bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Purmimamsa, there is the idea of religion and in Uttara Mimamsa there is the idea of brahma
 atah purvamimasaa kaa dharmamimasaa ar uttar mimasaa kaa brahmamimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 Mimamsa is called 'jaiminiya Dharmamimamsa' from the sutra hahene composed by Jaimini Muni
 purvamimasaa main veda ke yajnparak vachanon kii vyakhya bade vichaar ke saath kii gayi he
 There is a detailed discussion of Yajna in Mimamsa Shastra, this is also called 'yajnavidya'
 baarah adhyyon main vibhakt hone ke kaaran yah mimasaa 'dwadashalakshani' bhi kehalaati he
 The name of this scripture is not named 'purvimamsa' with the intention that it was made before Uttermimansa
 'purv' kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki karmkand manushya kaa pratham dharm he, gyankand kaa adhikaar uske uparant aata he 
 The word 'mimansa' means 'curiosity'
 jigyaasa, arthath jaanane kii laalasaa
 When a man incarnated in this world, his first curiosity was what should he do? Maharish Jaimini starts this book in this way- atev is darshanashastra kaa pratham sutara manushya kii is ichha kaa pratik he
 The six means of achievement of knowledge in this book are discussed - direct, conjecture, subhuman, word, economy and unavailability
 mimasaa darshan ke anusaar veda aporushey, nity evam sarvopari he or veda-pratipaadit arth ko hi dharm kaha gaya he
 Its second sutra states- mimasaa kaa tatvasiddhanth vilakshan he 
 It is counted in atheistic philosophies
 aatma, brahm, jagat aadi kaa vivechan isamen nahin he
 It only represents the continuity of the Veda or its word
 iske anusaar mantra hi sab kuch hai
 He is the deity; Gods have no separate power
 'bhattadipika' main spasht kaha he 'shabd maatram devtaa' 
 The argument of the believers is that all are for the purpose of the results
 fal kii prapti karm dwaara hi hoti hai atah ve kehete hai ki karm or uske pratipadak vachanon ke atirikt upar se or kisi devtaa yaa ishwar ko maanane kii kya aavashyaktaa he
 The great distinction between the Mimansakas and the Naiyayikas is that Mimansak considers the word eternal and eternal impermanence
 sankhya or mimasaa donon anishvaravaadi hai, par veda kii pramanikta donon maanate hai 
 The difference is so much that Sankhya considers the new revelation of Veda in every kalpa and Mimansak calls it non-destructive even in Kalpanta
 mimasaa darshan 16 adhyyon kaa he, jisamen 12 adhyay krambaddh hai
 Shastra Sangathi is associated with Adhyatagati, Padasangati and Adhyakanti
 in baarah adhyyon main jo chhot gaya he, uskaa nirupan shesh chaar adhyyon main kiya gaya he jo 'sankarshkand' ke naam se prasiddh he
 The authority of the deity has been discussed in it, hence it is also called the 'deity Case' or it can also be called an appendix of two chapters
 bhaskar raay dikshit ne sankarshan kand kii vyakhya ke ant main likhaa he ki shodashadhai mimasaa ke rahete hue bhi madhya kaal main dwadashadhyay kaa hi pathnpathan hota tha
 Dharmapramanas have been represented in the philosophy of this philosophy and method, economism mantra, memory, etiquette, nomadism, ambiguous sentences and decisive power
 dwitiyadhyaay main shabdaantar, abhyaas, sankhya, sangya, gun or prakarnaantar, ye chah karm bhed ke pramaan hai
 Shruti, gender, sentence, episode, place and Samakhya are the six evaluative evidences in Tritiyadhyaya
 chaturthadhyay main, shruti arth, paath, sthaan, mukhya or pravriti main chah bodhak pramaan hai
 There are seven types of excesses in Panchmadhyaya, directive, directive, nominal order, hypothetical order, dependency order and place-of-order

 The ninth chapter represents three types of "ooh"
 dashamadhyay main teen prakaar ke 'baadh' kaa nirupan he
 Ekadasadhyaya has the representation of Tantra and Aavya
 dwadashadhyay main "prasang" kaa nirupan he
 Thus each and every subject has been rendered in philosophical epistemology philosophy which has also been called "dvadashlakshi"
 yahan 'lakshan' shabd adhyaywachak he
 It has been divided in two ways, which is called preaching and overtaking
 pratham adhyyon main upadesh kaa vivechan he
 The six chapters of the second describe the overarching narrative
 ukt upadesh atidesh dway vichaaratmak shaastra he
 According to Shastra Deepikaar Parthasarathi Mishra, the beginning of the idea of precept is different from the precept
 vartmaan kaal main uplabdh mimasaa darshan main dwadash adhyay hai
 Each chapter has four legs, but the third, shashtha and tenth chapters have eight pahadas, also known as "shabara" chapters
 is tarah sampurna granth main saath paad hai
 There is controversy in the thread of this philosophy
 kisi ke mat main do sahasr chah sau baawan, kisi ke mat main do sahasr saat sau bayalis sutara hai
 The above description is propounded in the book page four of "aasikit" called "karmamimansa"
 anand ashram puna se prakashit "nyaayamala" main do sahasr saat sau pantalis sutron kaa pratipaadan he
 Similarly, the tribunal number of some persons is nine hundred and seven
 kuch ke mat se nau sau pandrah sutara hai
 But according to Shankar Bhatt, the doer of the "mimamsaar collection", there are five hundred thirty in "purushtak", four hundred and seventy sutras in Uttarashtak
 is prakaar sampurna adhikaran ek sahasr sankhya main vibhajit he
 According to the above verses, the number of tribunals is one thousand two hundred and fifty
 mimasaa main prayek adhikaran ke paanch bhaag hai— vishay, sanshay, purvapaksh, uttarapaksh or siddhanth 
 Therefore, to understand the Sutras, it is necessary to know which of the five sources is the proponent of which
 is shaastra main vaakya, prakaran, prasang yaa granth kaa taatpary nikaalane liye bahut sookshm niyam or yuktiyaan di gai hai
 This shloka of Mimansakas is generally famous for meaning- arthath kisi granth yaa prakaran ke taatparynirnay ke liye saat baton par dhyaan dena chahie—upkram, upsanhaar, abhyaas, apurvata, fal, arthwaad, or upapatti 
 Mimansak implies Vedas by such rules
 shabdaarthon kaa nirnay bhi vichaarpurvak kiya gaya he 
 For example, for 'yajna' where 'sahasra Samvatsar' is there, 'samvatsar' should be taken as the day, etc
 mimasashastra karmkand kaa pratipadak he; atah mimasak paurushey, apaurushey sabhi vaakyon ko kaaryparak maanate hai
 They say that every sentence is indicative of a business or a deed, which results in something
 atah ve kisi baat ke sambandh main yah nirnay karnaa bahut aavashyak maanate hai ki vah 'vidhi-vaakya' he athwa keval arthwaad 
 Like, "go to the battlefield, there is heaven"
 is vaakya ke do khand hai — 'rankshetra main jaao' yah to vidhivaakya yaa mukhya kathan he, or 'vahaan swarg rakhaa he' yah keval arthwaad yaa gaun baat he
 Its sources are of Jaimini and the commentary is of Shabar Swami
 mimasaasutra par kumaril bhatta ke 'kaatantravaarthik' or 'shlokavarthik' bhi prasiddh hai 
 Madhwacharya has also composed a commentary called 'jaiminiya Nyayamala Vistar'

 aaryasptshati sanskrit main muktak geeti-kavitaaon vaali ek kriti he
 It is considered the composition of Govardhanacharya
 isamen 700 aryaayein sangrahit honi chahie parantu vibhinn sanskarnon main aryaaon kii sankhya 760 tak pahunch gai he
 Therefore, it is difficult to say that the available Aryasaptashati is devoid of intercepts
 madhyayug main yah sangrah kaaphi lokapriy tha or uski aryaaon kii chaaya lekar bahut si footkar rachanaayen likhi gayi
 The "satsai" of the Bihari poet is heavily influenced by this collection
 aaryasptshati main hi yah ullekh miltaa he ki jo shringarras kii dhara praakrit main hi uplabdh thi usko sanskrit me avatarit karne ke liye yah prayaas kiya gaya he
 The allusion here is to the recent "gathasaptashati"
 haal ne praakrit gaathaon main shringarparak rachanaayen nibaddh kii he
 Govardhan idealized these gathas as his Aryans
 praakrit kaa gaathachand, sanskrit ke aryaalandon ke adhik nikat he at: govardhan ne aryaachand ko hi rachana ke liye chunaa
 Govardhan often imitates the hall not only in the verses but also in the imagery
 parantu isse yah nahin samajhnaa chahie ki aaryasptshati, gathasptshati kaa sanskrit anuwaad maatr he
 Whenever Govardhan wants to express the feeling of a saga, he does not miss the performance of his original talent in it
 at: aaryaspshati gathasptshati se sthoolrup main prabhavit hote hue bhi apane aapmen mailic he
 Govardhan is considered as Acharya for the expression of Shringar
 inako rachanaaon main shringaar kaa uddaam rup khulkar aayaa he
 At some places, nude depictions create excitement due to their nakedness
 ek jagah to govardhan ne prem main shav ke chumban kii bhi baat kahi he
 But Govardhanacharya can be counted in Satkavis due to the intensity of expression, ornamentation, and severity of euphemism

 This started showing signs of the beginning of a sweet relationship between the two countries

 It can also be called peaceful co-existence
 ditant french bhashaa kaa shabd he jiskaa arth he - tanaav main shithilataa 
 It is often used in international relations to reduce the tensions prevailing between the US and the Soviet Union after World War II, and to enhance their sense of cooperation and peaceful coexistence
 america or soviet sangh ke madhya dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad vyaapt tanaav yaa sheet yuddh main ai kami ke pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit the- In this way, the cold war between the two countries gradually turned in the direction of tensions and the atmosphere of new international relations was prepared in which peace and harmony was the paramount place instead of fear
 1963 main cuba sankat ke baad donon mahashaktiyon ne takaraav kaa rasta chhodkar shantipurna sah astitv kii niti apnaane par vichaar kiya
 Both made some efforts to reduce mutual tension which are as follows: - in prayaason ke atirikt 1972 main donon mahashaktiyon ke bich masco vaarta, 1972 kaa sabt-ek samjhauta, soviet sangh-america aarthik sahyog, behnev kii america yatra, 1973, apollo-soyuj kaa antariksh main mail, salt-2 samjhauta 1979, aadi prayaason se bhi sheet yuddh main kami ai
 But from 1963 to 1970, the signs of the lack of the Cold War remained small
 is dauraan bharat-paak yuddh 1965 ko lekar donon mahashaktiyon main tanaav barkaraar rahaa
 The arab-israeli War in 1967 also continued the Cold War
 iske dauraan sheet yuddh main kami laane ke prayaas kiye jate rahe hai or unhen aanshik safalataa bhi mili
 Hence it is called the 'passive period of the day'
 isaki vaastavik pragati 1970 main shuru hui or 1979 tak yah charam seemaa par pahunch gaya
 This time is called the 'active period of the day'
 is samay ditant ne antarrashtriya sambandhon ko bahut prabhavit kiya or puraane sheetakaaleen sambandh samaapt hote najar jaae
 The tradition changed the landscape of the old international relations arising out of the Cold War and a peaceful atmosphere was born in the world
