 The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale, unresolved political struggle
 This type of conflict varies widely; Historical examples include: aatankwaadi hamalon main aksar dar or prachaar ko adhiktam karne ke liye lakshith kar rahe hai

 In this methodology, one or more flags are assigned to the individual account to meet certain requirements, which allows the account holder to use certain tools different from the usual editors
 is parivartankaal ke dauraan is baat par bal diya gaya tha ki prabandhakon ko ek vishesh upasamooh main kabhi nahin viksit karnaa chahie
 Rather, managers should be a part of the community like other editors, with no special powers or privileges when they act as editors
 sadaiv yah mana gaya he ki prabandhak samaaj kaa koi vishesh bhaag na hokar usee kaa sadsy he
 If seen, most of the management of Wikipedia can be done by anyone, which does not require any specific technical tools which are given to the managers
 vikipedia ke sansthaapak jimi wales ke anusaar: i want to say that becoming a sci-op is * not a big deal *

 yah to keval takneekee baat he ki kisi ko yahan ke kuch mukhya takneekee kaary karne ke liye chunaa gaya, sabhi ko nahin
 i do not want anyone to think that managerial position is a special thing
 is puure kathan kaa yah arth lagaaya ja saktaa he ki takneekee kaaryo ko daayitvapurn rup se va sahi karnaa jitna mahatvapurn he utana, vahi keval ek prabandhak hona nahin
 According to Wikipedia, there are no fixed rules that one can or will not become a manager
 koi bhi prabandhak pad ke liye aavedan kar saktaa he
 It would be more necessary for the applicant to have confidence in Wikipedia than it was in the past
 par phir bhi aavedak dwaara purv main kiye gaye kaaryo kaa mahatv to he hi
 In the view of every editor, a candidate may have different views
 unka vishvas praapt karnaa unke aapke bare main vichaaron par nirbhar he
 Before applying for a nomination or accepting your nomination by someone else, note that the candidate must have been active on Wikipedia for at least a few months, familiar with the work done here
 
 achche vyavhaar or vikipedia kii niti nirdeshon main vishvas use maananaa chahie or samaaj kaa vishwaas praapt karnaa chahie
 If you agree with all the laws and policy instructions of the manager, then you can visit the chaupal for more information related to the request for your nomination
 namakan hone ke baad uske bare main samaaj dwaara is bare main charchaa hogi na ki koi matdaan
 After about a week or as the intention of the administrator, this discussion will be concluded and a decision will be taken on it

 Keep in mind that no matter how many accounts are on Wikipedia by a person, only one of them can be given manager rights
 ek baar prabandhak banaae jane par yah sadaa ke liye ho saktaa he jab tak use kisi vishesh karno se nahin hataa diya jaye jo ki praayah vikipedia ke niyam todane par yaa apane adhikaron ke durupyog par hota he
 If you are made a manager, you should take special care in exercising the new rights granted to you
 vishesh rup se lekhon va prishthon ko mitaanaa or ypi paton ke anusaar sadasyon par pratibandh lagaana
 See this instruction for how to exercise your new rights and what to do or not or get advice from the members already in the managerial position
 kripaya jhijake nahin
 Utilizing manager rights depends on your own decision and it can take a lot of time to learn how to use which tool and when and for how long
 jaise ki prishthon va lekhon ko surakshit karnaa yaa kisi sadsy ko pratibandhit karnaa
 New managers are advised to gradually start their work in the new position, understand and move forward
 ek saath sab kuch karne kii niti nahin apanaae
 It is also expected that the managers will take special care of the security of their accounts
 apane khaaton kii kunji kathin rakhen jo ki sochaa yaa todaa na ja sake or apane khate ke saath jude email pate kii suraksha bhi chaak chobandh rakhe
 The rights of the manager can be specifically used to perform these functions of Wikipedia: prabandhakon se yah aashaa kii jaati he kii vah sabake liye ek udahaaran prastut kare or sadaiv auron se vaartalap karte samay tameez va sanyam barte
 The managers are also expected to follow the rules of Wikipedia and do their tasks well
 kabhi kabhaar koi bhul ho sakati he, aakhir prabandhak bhi manushya hote he or kabhi kabhaar ke dosha kshamaa kiya ja saktaa he
 However, he may also be removed from the post for faults that have caused heavy damage to Wikipedia, or for making frequent wrong decisions or actions
 prabandhakon ko or puraane anbhavi lekhako ko aisa vyavhaar karnaa chahie jo kii anya sadasyon ke liye udhaaharan bane
 The managers should keep in mind that in this fast phase of development of Wikipedia, they have many more managers and companions here
 yadi kisi vishay par unhen lage kii vah sahi yaa nyaaypurna nirnay nahin le paa rahe he to unako anya saathiyo se sahaayta maangani chahie or un vishyon par chaoupal or samaaj main charchaa karaani chahie, yah nahin kii vah apane aap nirnay lene ke chakkar main galat nirnay len
 The manager is solely responsible for the management work done by him
 jaise kii unako die gaye adhikaron va auzaaron ke upyog, jinke dwaara vah anya sampadakon ko thes yaa haani pahunchaa sakate hai jinke paas unke jaise adhikaar nahin he
 Any editor or member has the right to criticize the work done by a manager unless it is done in a respectful manner, in the realm of tameness and in a sense of malice
 prabandhakon se yah aashaa kii jaati he kii vah is prakaar kii gai aalochana ko galat bhav se naa lekar uskaa puure uttardaayitv va tameez ke saath uttar de va yadi koi bhul ho to use saafe man se maan le
 Those managers who have lost their faith in the society and those who repeatedly have faulty behavior can be removed from this post
 yah wo kaaran he jinakein kaaran purv main kai prabandhakon ko hataaya ja chukaa he: If a member feels that a manager has taken a wrong decision against him, then he should talk to that manager directly with courtesy on this issue and try to resolve the issue
 dwesh yaa aavesh main galat shabdon kaa prayog karne se bachein
 However, if this issue is not resolved on both sides, it can be raised in Wikipedia: Chaupal or talk to other managers about it
 aap unhen sidhe email bhi bhej sakate hai 
 Misuse of their managerial equipment and rights is a serious issue and is against Wikipedia's rules
 yah sabhi adhikaar kisi sadsy ko vikipedia pranali ke kuch mahatvapurn kaam karne ke liye die jate he va inkaa kisi bhi surat main durupyog nahin hona chahie
 In any case, use them wisely, due to wrong uses, they can also be withdrawn
 aam sthitiyaan jaha apane prabandhak adhikaron kaa istemaal karne se bache: Managers should avoid exercising their rights in cases in which they themselves are involved, they may be accused of taking advantage of their rights
 aise main nirnay kisi or ko lene den
 If any of the rules of Wikipedia states that managers should not use their rights or equipment in any work or for any reason, neither should they
 kuch maamalon main apwaad ke tor par prayog kare to uski majboot vajah honi chahie va usase pehle chaoupal par vaartalap karnaa uchit hoga
 No manager should refrain from changing or taking action against a fellow manager like himself
 jaruri hone par, pehle baatcheet kare va dekhe asli masalaa kya he
 Work together
 agar kisi kaaryo ko badla ja chukaa he yaa kisi se koi adhikaar waapas liya ja chukaa he, to bina aam raay ke use purvawat nahin kare
 Every time you avoid taking decisions yourself and when necessary, consult other managers and let them take decisions
 jaruri nahin kii aap har masale main sahi nirnay le paae, par anya koi jarur le saktaa he
 It is necessary to work together
 yah baat dhyaan main rakhni chahie kii kisi prabandhak dwaara agar kisi sadsy, lekh, pusht, vivaad aadi pe apane adhikaron kaa upyog liya gaya ho, va agar voh uchit, karypranali ke adheen, or sankshipt ho to voh unhi lekho, pusht, vivaado va sadasyon ke saath dubaara un adhikaron kaa upyog kar saktaa he
 isse koi farak nahin padataa kii voh purv main bhi isamen shaamil tha
 yah isliye kyon kii prabandhak kaa to kaam hi aise kaary karnaa he
 haa agar wo chaahe toh ek acchhee aadat ke tahat ise kisi or prabandhak ko karne ke liye sope sakate he, par aisa karnaa jaruri nahin he
 If the case is the same as before and has come up for the same reasons, then it may be that the decision of the manager is the same as before in that case
 kisi prabandhak kaa kisi masale main yaa sadsy ke saath vivaad main sirf isliye nahin mana ja saktaa kii usne pehle kabhi use koi chetavanee jari kii thi jo kii uske dwaara kiye gaye koi aise kaam kii vajah se thi jisase kii koi vikipedia niyam tutaa tha
 isse kisi prabandhak dwaara bhavishya main aise kisi lekh yaa sadsy ke khilaaf karwaai ko dwesh main yaa "khud samilit hone kaa aarope" ke tahat nahin liya ja saktaa
 However, if there is hope that all these things can arise, then the best thing will be that in such cases any other manager should take the decision, and you should give it to him
 prabandhak / prashaasak pad se kisi sadsy ko hataane kaa praavdhaan kuch vikiyon main he evam kuch vikiyon main nahin he
 For example, on other English wikis, administrators can remove the manager, thus some other wiki projects also have provisions to remove the manager
 fransisi vikipedia main to 6 maheene se adhik niskriy rahane vaale prabandhko ko nirantar hataaya jaataa rahaa he jiskaa kaaran he ki naye kushal sakriy sadasyon ko padontti dena evam lambe samay kii anupasthiti ke kaaran hekking dwaara prabandhakon ke khaaton kaa durupyog na hona hai
 
 jaisaa ki prabandhan naam se hi spasht he ki kai mahatvapurn kaaryon kaa mahatvapurn avasaron par prabandh karnaa, atah prabandhan adhikaar rakhane vaale sadasyon kii viki par sakriy upasthiti atyaavashyak he
 Now many subscriptions have also been made on the Hindi wiki, from which it is not necessary to become a manager for a particular task
 sadsy prabandhak ke jis adhikaar main swayan ko kushal maanate he use alag se praapt kar sakate he
 Yes, all the members are welcome for management rights for many tasks of the manager or those tasks which are beyond the limit of new members
 in sab vikiyon kii tarj par hindi viki par bhi prashaskon dwaara prabandhakon ko nimna kaarnon se pad mukt kiya ja saktaa he- 
 praayah prabandhko se hue kisi bhi vaad-vivaad ko vaartalap se suljhaana chahie or chaoupal par charchaa kerani chahie

 Those in the family who have or have had this disease are more likely to develop mania
 atyaadhik tanaav, saamaajik dabaav, tathaa pareshaaniyaan bhi beemaari ko banaaye rakhane yaa thik na hone kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 The most suitable method of treatment of this disease is free association

 Discontinuing treatment without medical advice increases the likelihood of recurrence of the disease
 iskaa ilaaj lambey samay tak chal saktaa he isliye chikitsak kii salaah ke bina dawa ko ghataya-badhaaya nahin janaa chahie
 Some unnecessary effects should be kept in mind while taking medicines such as- in anaavashyak prabhaavon ke hane par dawa kaa seven roke nahi, kyonki yah samay ke saath apane aap hi kam ho jate hai, tathaa inako rokane ke liye saamaanya si saavdhaaniyaan bhi rakhi ja sakati hai- Who has a mania patient in or around his house nirdeshaank: 15°14′N 74°10′E / 15

 Template: The Who ek chikitsa nidaan ke rup main, bal yon shoshan peedophilia, ko aamtaur par vayaskon yaa bade umr ke kishoron main maansik vikaar ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, jo gaiyr-kishor bacchon ke prati praathmik yaa vishesh yon ruchi dwaara charitaarth hota he
 In case of adolescent exploiters aged 16 or older, the child should be at least five years younger
 The word originated from the Greek: παῖς, meaning "child", "and φιλία," friendly love "or" friendship ", although in modern times its literal meaning is used by pedophiles, who symbolize their choice
 And the use of the code has been changed to sexual attraction towards children under the title "child love" or "child lover"
 rogon ke antarrashtriya vargeekaran ne peedophilia ko "vayask vyaktitv or vyavhaar ke vikaar" ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he, jisamen chote umr ke kishoron yaa bahut chote umr ke bacchon ke prati yon ruchi hoti he
 Numerous definitions of the term have been found in psychiatry, psychology, vernacular and law enforcement
 diagnostic and statistical minial of mental disorders ke anusaar peedophilia ek paraphilia he jisamen ek vyakti chote bacchon kii ore bhavuk or baarambaar yon agrahon kii disha main kalpanasheel ho jaataa he or jiske baad vah yaa to yatharth main ise puraa karte he yaa jo sankat kaa kaaran hota he yaa parsparik samasya hota he
 The current DSM-5 draft proposed adding hebaphilia to the diagnostic criteria and hence was renamed as pedohebophilic disorder
 haalanki yah vikaar zyaadaatar purushon main hota he, saath hi kuch mahilaayein bhi hai jinamein yah vikaar paaya jaataa he, or shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki peedophilia kaa uplabdh anumaan main mahilaon kii sankhya kam he
 No treatment has been developed for pedophilia
 haalanki iske liye kuch vishesh chikitsa he jo ki vyakti main bacchon ke saath yon shoshan karne kii bhaavana ko kam kar saktaa he
 In the United States, since Kansas v
 Hendrix, sex offenders who have a diagnosis of a mental disorder, especially pedophilia, may be subject to an indefinite civil commitment, under various state laws, and the federal Adam Walsh Ball

 aam upyog main peedophilia kaa arth he kisi bhi bachche ke prati yon ruchi yaa main kisi bhi bachche ke saath yon durvyavhaar karnaa, ise aksar "peedophilic vyavhaar" kaha jaataa he
 For example, The American Heritage Stedmans Medical Dictionary stated that, "pedophilia is an activity or fantasy of sexually abusing a child or children on behalf of adults
 " yah aam upyog anuprayog yon ruchi main bhi vistaarit hota he or choti umr ke bacchon yaa bade umr ke bacchon kaa yon shoshan kiya jaataa he
 Researchers suggest that these incorrect uses should be avoided, as people who sexually abuse children are normally afflicted with a muscular disorder, but some offenders differ from the standard diagnosis of pedophilia and clinical diagnosis
 The standard deals with children of age just before they reach adulthood
 iske atirikt, sabhi peedophyle vastav main is prakaar kaa durvyavhaar nahin karte hai
 Pedophilia was first formally recognized in the late 19th century
 1980 ke dashak ke baad se is kshetra main mahatvapurn maatra main anusandhan kiya gaya he
 Currently, the exact reasons for having pedophilia have not been established
 shodh bataate hai ki peedophilia kai alag-alag mastishk sambandhi asaamanyataon ke saath sahasambaddha ho sakate hai or aksar anya vyaktitv vikaron or manovaigyanik vikrutiyon ke saath maujuud hote hai
 a diversity of typologies has been suggested for the classification of pedophiles according to behavior and motivation in the contexts of forensic psychology and law enforcement
 is shabd kii vyutpatti unani : παιδοφιλία παῖς se hui he, jiskaa arth he baccha or φιλία kaa arth he "dostana pyaar" yaa "dosti"
 aadhunik samay main, peedophyle ke liye "bal prem" yaa "bal premi" kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or vyapak rup se romantic yaa yon aakarshan ke rup main kaha jaataa he
 
 inphentophilia, yaa nepeophilia, kaa istemaal shishuon or chote bacchon ke prati yon ruchi kaa ullekh karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Pedophilia is used for sexual interest of adults with children 13 or younger
 hebephilia ko praathmik rup se 11-14 umr ke bacchon ke saath vayaskon kii yon ruchi ke liye paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 DSM IV did not list hebaphilia at diagnosis, whereas ICD-10 pedophilia included hebaphilia
 shabd peedophilia irotica ko 1886 main vineez manochikitsak richard won craft-abing dwaara unki psycopetheya sexualij kriti main gadha gaya tha
 The term appears in the section titled "violation of persons under fourteen years old", which generally focuses on the aspect of forensic psychiatry of child abuse offenders
 craft-abing aparaadhiyon ke kai prakaaron kaa varnan karti he, mul rup se unhen psycopathological or gaiyr-psycopathological main vibhajit karti he or kai spasht kaarnon kaa anumaan karti he jo ki bal shoshan kii ore agrasar ho sakati he
 kraft-ebbing mentions pedophilia erotica in a type of "psychological sexual perversion"
 unhone likhaa he ki upane karier main unhen keval chaar baar iskaa saamana karnaa padaa tha or prayek maamle kaa unhone sankshipt vivaran diya tha, jiske teen aam lakshan hai: He has cited several cases of adult women suffering from pedophilia and considered abuses by gay men with boys extremely rare
 is baat ko or spasht karne ke liye kaha ki, unhone sanket diya he ki vayask purushon ke maamalon jinamein kuch chikitsakeey yaa mastishk sambandhi vikaar hota he or bacchon ke saath durupyog karnaa peedophilia nahin hota he or unki nigaraanee main vaise purush ativyask or bachche hote hai
 He has also listed pseudopidophilia related to it, in which "individuals who lose libido through masturbation and later become attracted to children for their sexual appetites" are considered the most common symptoms
 1908 main, swiss neuranatomist or manochikitsak agste foril ne is ghatana ke bare main likhaa, jisamen "paderosisi", "bacchon ke liye yon bhukh" ke rup main prastaavit kiya
 Like kraft-ebbing's work, Fole made a distinction between accidental sexual abuse by a person with dementia and other biological brain conditions, and a sexual and sometimes special preference for children
 However, he disagreed with the idea of it being sustainable and irreversible after craft-ebbing
 is sthiti ke liye shabd "peedophilia" aam taur par sweekaarya ho gaya he or 20 veen sadi main bade paimaane par dekha gaya or stedman ke 5 wein sanskaran ke rup main lokapriy chikitsa shabdkosh main paaya gaya
 In 1952 it was included in the first edition of the Diagnosis of Mental Disorders and Statistics Manual
 is sanskaran or aanevaale DSM-II vargeekaran ke ek upaprakaar ke rup main "yon vichlan" vikaar soochibaddh kiya gaya lekin naidanik mandandon ko pradaan nahin kiya gaya
 The DSM-III, published in 1980, described the disorder in full and provided guidelines for diagnosis
 1987 main sanshodhan aar, DSM-III-, main vivaran ko mote taur par hi rakhaa gaya, lekin adhyatan or vistaarit naidanik mandandon ko pradaan kiya gaya
 Some physicians proposed a few more classes that differed somewhat from pedophilia, including "pedohebophilia", "hebephilia", and "ephebophilia"
 Other experts, such as Karen Franklin, classify hebephilia as a "pretextual" diagnosis that should not be treated as a disorder
 aisidi-10, peedophilia ko "bachche, ladke ladkiyaan yaa donon ke liye yon variyata, aamtaur par kam umr yaa ati kam umr ke bachche ke rup main ke rup main paribhaashit karata he
 "the criteria for this system are based on a person aged 16 or over if there is a persistent or dominant sexual desire for children at least five years younger than that
 
 The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder Text Revision outlines specific criteria for use in the diagnosis of this disorder
 isamen kalpanayukta, vyavhaar yaa aagrah se utpann yon vyavhaar kii upasthiti jisamen choti umr ke bachche ke saath yon gatividhi kareeb chah mahine yaa usase adhik samay ke liye or is prakaar ke ichchhaaon ke liye rogi in agrahon yaa sankat se grast hote hai
 The criteria also indicate that the patient must be 16 or older and that children he or she thinks should be at least 5 years younger than him or her, although children ages 12–13 and older adolescents
 It is advisable to separate from it
 bachche kii ling ke aadhaar par rogi ke nidaan ko or adhik nirdisht kiya gaya he, yadi aavegon yaa anachar karne ke liye simit kaary kar rahe hai or yadi"aakarshan" "vishesh" yaa "gaiyr vishesh" he to
 Numerous terms have been used to describe actual pedophilia, ranging from non-pedophilic to non-particular offenders, or an interest in pedophilic has been seen to distinguish between types of offenders according to motivation for offenders
 vishesh peedophilia ko kabhi-kabhi "vaastavik peedophilia" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 They are attracted to children only
 kuch maamalon main ve apane umr ke logon main ruchi pradarshit karte hai or aisa tabhi hota he jab ve kisi bachche kii upasthiti kii kalpana karte hai
 a patient with non-specialized pedophilia may be referred to as a non-pedophilic offender, but the two terms are not always synonymous
 gaiyr-vishesh peedophilia ke rogi bachche or vayask donon se aakarshith hote hai or donon ke dwaara yon ichha hoti he, haalanki yon variyata ek ke bajaae duusare main zyada maujuud ho saktaa he
 Neither ICD nor DSM diagnostic criteria are required for actual sexual activity with young age youth
 kalpana kii maujuudagi yaa yon aagrah ke aadhaar par iskaa nidaan kiya ja saktaa he, yahaan tak ki kabhi aisi koi gatividhi nahin hui ho
 duusari ore, ek vyakti jo iskaa anubhav kar chukaa ho or apni kalpana yaa aagrah ko lekar kisi prakaar kaa sankat mahasoos nahin kiya ho, unka bhi nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Sexual urges to diagnose it are not limited to sex, and sometimes masturbation can be seen by obscene exposure, vorealistic or frateristic, or child prognosis
 aksar, in kaaryon main naidanik nirnay se pehle ek tatv ke saath sandarbh par vichaar karne kii jarurat he
 Similarly, when the patient is an older adolescent, the age difference is more difficult to specify and instead requires consideration of the situation
 igo-distonic yon abhivinyas main un logon ko shaamil kiya jaataa he jo bal yon shoshan main apane shaamil hone ke ke bare koi andeh nahin hota lekin manovigyaanik or vyavhaar vikaar ke chalate isaki alag ichha hoti he
 The World Health Organization allows its patients to seek treatment to change their sexual orientation
 DSM IV maapdand kii adhik samaveshi ke saath-saath kam samaveshi hone ke liye aalochana kii gai he
 Although most researchers distinguish child libido from a patient of pedophilia, Studer and Alvin argue that DSM criteria are more inclusive because all acts of child abuse justify the diagnosis
 ek bal utpeedak e maapdandon ko santusht karata he kyonki chote umr ke bacchon ke saath yon gatividhi ke saath vyavhaar shaamil hota he or maapdand bi kyonki vyakti un agrahon par krity karata he
 Further, they argue that it is less inclusive in the case of individuals who do not act on it and are not disturbed by it
 Later points were made by several other researchers who stated that it is a so-called "satiated pedophile" - a man who imagines engaging in sexual activity with a child and masturbating, but never with a child
 Not having sexual intercourse and after which the patient does not feel distressed - does not meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for pedophilia, because this person meets criteria b Security does not
 vibhinn vargeekaran pranali ke upyog ke bare main ek bade paimaane par surveykshan se pataa chalaa ki DSM vargeekaran kaa shaayad hi kabhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 a suggestion in the form of a description was made that DSM may lead to rejection of the classification due to low totality as well as lack of validity, reliability, and clarity
 re blonchard ne DSM-5 ke liye apane sahitya kii samiksha kii, aapattiyon ko note kiya or peedophyle rogi ke liye ek saamaanya samaadhaan lagu karne kaa prastaav rakhaa, arthath paraphilia or parafilic vikaar ke bich antar ko bataaya
 baad ke shabd ko naidanik sthiti ko pahchaanane ke liye prastaavit kiya gaya jo ki maandand e r bi donon ko puraa karata he, jabaki ek vyakti jo maapdand bi ko puraa nahin karata he, use nirdhaarit kar sakate hai, lekin uskaa nidaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he, chunki use paraphilia hota he
 The current proposal for DSM v will also resolve the current overlap between pedophilia and hebeapilia by combining both diagnoses into a single newly diagnosed pedohebophilic disorder
 This new diagnosis would be equivalent to the ICD-10 definition of pedophilia that already contains early pubescents
 tathaapi, o'donohue ek alag disha main is mudde ko le liya he, jo ki naidanik maandand akele bacchon ke liye aakarshan karne ke liye saral ho saktaa he uske bajaay suzav detaa he yadi aatm report, prayogshaala nishkarshon, yaa pichley vyavhaar se pataa lagaaya jaae

 "similarly, in 1997, Howard E
 Barbary and Michael C
 Seto disagreed with the American Psychiatric Association's approach and recommended the use of classification as the only criterion for simplifying pedophilia diagnosis
 bal yon shoshan ke 1993 kii ek samiksha main sheron araji or david phinkelhor ne kaha ki vartmaan main is kshetra se sambandhit shodh ke aviksit hone ke kaaran, "paribhaashik samasyaon" ke kaaran shodhakartaaon ke bich "peedophilia" shabd ke istemaal main maanakeekaran kii kami he
 He described two definitions, a "restrictive" form referring to people with sexual interest in strong and special children, and a "holistic" definition, the term expanded and Criminals have been involved who have engaged in sexual contact with a child, including incest
 unhone kaha ki unhone apni samikshatmak lekh main vyapak paribhaasha kaa istemaal kiya he taaki vyaavhaarik maapdand ko aasaani se pahachaanaa ja sake or ek vyakti kii manshaa ke liye jatil vishaleshan kii aavashyaktaa na ho
 Pedophilia can be described as a disorder of sexual preference, a phenomenon similar to homosexual or heterosexual orientation, because its emergence develops before or during younger ages and because it stabilizes over time
 haalanki in tippaniyon main maansik vikaar ke ek samooh se peedophilia ko shaamil nahin kiya jaataa he kyonki peedophilic kriya nuksaan pahunchaati he kabhi-kabhi peedophyle maansit swasthya peshwaron ko unke aavegon se kaary karne se madad karti he
 Although the cause of pedophilia is not yet known, in 2002 researchers reported a series of people with pedophilia related brain structure and its functions: Pedophilic men have lower IQ scores lower in memory tests, non-left
 Behavior due to high number of hand people, failure in school grades and above IQ differences, low physical height, head injury in childhood Be faced minister, and several differences in MRI brain structures

 a functional neuroimaging study in 2008 commented that sexual stimulation of central processing in heterosexual "pedophile forensic patients" may be altered by disturbance in the prefrontal network that is associated with "behavioral compulsive sexually controlled behaviors, such as encouragement

 Many researchers have reported correlations between pedophilia and this type of psychological characteristics, such as low self-esteem and poor social skills
 Cohen et al
, Studying child sexual abuse, stated that victims of pedophilia impair interpersonal function and impair passive-aggression as well as self-concept
 disinehibitary lakshan ke bare main peedophyle vikrut sosiopathi or sangyanatmak pravriti kaa pradarshan karte hai
 According to the authors, the symptoms of pedophiles help support the pathological personality hypothesis in which such distortion is related to further motivation for pedophilic behavior

 a review of the study of child sex offenders, a qualitative research study published between 1982 and 2001, concluded that pedophiles use cognitive distortion to satisfy their individual needs and justify mistreatment by excuses, love and reciprocity Redefine their actions and exploit the innate ability in all adult-child relationships
 anya sangyanatmak vikrutiyon main "kaamuktha ke rup main bal shoshan", "yon kriya main aniyantran" or "yon paatrata-purvaagrah" shaamil hai
 a review of the literature concluded that research on personality is co-related and that psychopathology in pedophiles is rarely correct as a rule, leading to confusion between pedophiles and child sexual abuse perpetrators, as well as difficult to obtain pedophile representations and community sampling is

 According to Ron Hiera, assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, the salary mean for the new H-1B information technology in 2005 was only $ 50,000, which is BS

 When an ex-employee named Guy Santiglia filed complaints in the US Department of Justice and the US Department of Labor alleging that the Santa Clara establishment discriminated against US nationals in favor of foreign employees over H-1B visas Goes, then in 2002, the US government began investigating the appointment methods of Sun Microsystems
 In late 2001, when the company fired 3,900 employees and applied for thousands of visas at the same time, Santaglia accused the company of discriminating against US citizens
 He said that in 2002, about 5 percent of the 39,000 Sun employees had temporary work visas

 The costs that come to a company to apply for an H1-B visa can be significant and can range between $ 1,440 and $ 5,000, since those petitioners since President Obama signed the Public Law 111-230 statute , Who have employed 50 or more employees in the United States and who have more than 50 percent of their employees in the United States since 14 August 2010 The H1B fee has been increased by $ 2000 for ch1-b or l non-immigrant status, depending on the attorneys' fees, the number of employees in the company, and whether the faster premium service Was paid for and does not include the cost of a possible tour to the extent of the country of origin and the cost of recycling

 In addition, if the employer has to sack the employee, the company will have to pay any reasonable costs that will again come to the employee in transporting himself or his dependents to their last foreign residence
 This provision only involves dismissal, it is not relevant when an employee decides to resign automatically

 Although immigration usually requires short-term and long-term visitors to relinquish any longing to obtain a green card, H-1B visa holders are an important exception in the sense that the dual-purpose principle names The concept known as H-1B has been legally recognized as a possible step towards green cards
 niyokta amareeki department of lebar main ek alian lebar certification daayar karke ech1-bi visa dharakon ko unke green card ke liye pryojit kar sakate hai

 iske kaaran ech1-bi visa dharak dwaara apane niyokta ke prati dabaavpurn vafadari ke ek tatv kaa nirmaan hua
 Critics allege that this coercive loyalty benefits employers because it reduces the risk that an H-1B employee will leave their job and start working for a competitor, and this allows civilian employees to get jobs
 There is a loss in the market because the employer is less assured that the citizen stays in his job for an extended period of time Singing, especially if working conditions are tough, wages are lower or working too hard or complicated
 It has been argued that this makes the H1-B visa program highly attractive to employers and labor laws in this context have been influenced by trade groups striving to obtain such benefits

 In most states, H-1B employees and their dependents are not eligible to receive education in the state, no matter how much time they have spent in the US

 In addition, the United States has bilateral agreements with various countries, according to which the payback period in the US Social Security system, even if it is less than 10 years, is accepted in its equivalent system in that foreign nation

 If an H-1B employee is fired from the job for any reason, the H-1B program does not technically mention any time allowance or grace period for the person preparing to leave, even if he or she is H- Why should 1B employee have been living in USA for any period of time

 Some confusion about the "grace period" arises because an H-1B employee is granted a grace period of 10 days to leave the United States at the end of his or her authorized term of residence
 This grace period only applies if the employee works until the H-1B expiration date listed in their I-797 or I-94 card permission notice

 In some cases, if they have withdrawn labor certification and have been replaced by Perm applications, the process period will improve, but the person will also lose their favorable priority date
 In those cases, the employer’s attempt to hold an H-1B employee by proposing to provide a green card would fall short because the employer would have to bear the higher legal costs and fees associated with labor certification and the I-140 process, but H-1B employees will still be free to change jobs
