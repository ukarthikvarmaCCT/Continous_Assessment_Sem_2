 duniya kii samskruti main, paaramparik rup se kai alag-alag dharmik vishwaas ke samooh hai
 In Indian culture, various religious philosophies were traditionally regarded as academic differences that are pursuing the same truth
 islam main quran main teen alag-alag shreniyon kaa ullekh he : musalmaan, pustak ke log or murti poojak
 prarambh main, isaiyon ko duniya ke vishwaason se ek sahaj virodhabhas tha : isai sabhyataa banaam videshi mataantar yaa barbarta
 18 veen sadi main, "mataantar" kaa matlab spasht rup se yahudee dharm or islam tha; butaparasti ke saath ekamusth hokar, ise chaar bhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya, jise jon toland kii rachanaaon nazarenus yaa jivish, gentile or mahomethan chrischianity main boyaa gaya, jo dharm ke bheetar alag "rashtron" yaa sampradaayon, sachche akeshwarwad ke rup main teen abrahamik parampara kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Daniel Defoe describes the original definition as: "religion is worship to God but it also applies to idol worship and false gods
 " 19 veen sadi main 1780 se 1810 ke bich, bhashaa main naatakeey parivartan aayaa: "dharm" ke bajaay aadhyatmikta dharm kaa paryaay ban gai, lekhak isai or puja ke anya rup donon main "dharm" ke bahuvachan kaa prayog karne lage

 By the end of the 19th century, it was common for Christians to refer to these "pagan" sects as dead traditions that saw the "last, whole word of God" before Christianity
 This is no way to reflect the reality of religious experience: Christians have maintained themselves in an immutable state of these traditions ever since it was 'invented', but in reality all traditions remain in people's words and deeds

 The incident was sharply criticized by the European Orientalist and by 1960 was called "unscientific" because it allowed religious leaders to speak up about themselves rather than bowing to a better knowledge of Western education

 Nevertheless, Parliament encouraged a dozen funded private lectures with the intention that they would inform experienced people with religious diversity: researchers on these lectures, such as William James, DT Suzuki, and Alan Watts, wrote Religions of the World

 Historically, some large countries with a Christian population experienced significant declines in Christian active numbers: see Demography of Atheism
 Signs of an active decline in Christian religious life were reflected as well as a decline in pastoral and monastic life and reduced church attendance

 Later, on Ramachandra Deb establishing an independent kingdom in Khurda, the temple and its idols were restored
 
 According to the traditional legend associated with the origin of this temple, the original idol of Lord Jagannath made of Indranil or Sapphire was found under an Agaru tree
 yah itani chakchaundh karne vaali thi, ki dharm ne ise prithvi ke neeche chupaana chaha
 Malwa King Indradyumna saw this idol in his dream
 tab usne kadi tapasya kii or tab bhagwaan vishnu ne use bataaya ki vah puri ke samudr tat par jaye or use ek daaru kaa laththa milegaa
 He should build the idol with the same wood
 raja ne aisa hi kiya or use lakdi kaa laththa mil bhi gaya
 The king then appeared before him as Vishnu and Vishwakarma carpenter artisan and sculptor
 kintu unhone yah shart rakhi, ki ve ek maah main murti taiyaar kar denge, parantu tab tak vah ek kamare main band rahenge or raja yaa koi bhi us kamare ke andar nahin aaye
 On the last day of the month, when there was no sound for many days, the king eagerly peeped into the room and the old artisan came out by opening the door and told the king that the idols were still incomplete, his hands were not yet made
 raja ke afsos karne par, murtikar ne bataaya, ki yah sab daivavash hua he or yah murtiyon aise hi sthapit hokar puji jaayengin
 Then the idols of the same three Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were installed in the temple

 If a particle of charge q moves with the presence of an electric field e and velocity v in a magnetic field B, it will experience a force

 The first derivation of the Lorentes force is generally attributed to Oliver Hewissad in 1889, although other historians suggest earlier origins in the 1865 paper by James Clerk Maxwell

 More clearly stated: jisamen 'r' aaweshit kan kii sthiti vector he, t samay aa gaya he, or ek samay overdot vyutpann he
 For the proposal of a continuous charge distribution, the Lorents force equation becomes: jahaan d 'F' dq 'ke aarope ke saath prabharee vitaran ke ek chote se tukade par bal he'
 If the charge distributions on both sides of this equation are divided by the volume of this small piece of dv, the result is: jahaan 'f' bal ghanatv or ρ charge ghanatv he
 Subsequently, the current density corresponding to the charge continuum is proposed: isliye sameekaran ko nirantar anuroop he: f = ρ e + j × b { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {f} = \ rho \ mathbf {E} + \ mathbf {J} \ times \ mathbf {B} \ , \ !} kul bal maatra] prabharee vitaran khatm ho gaya he: By eliminating ρ and '' j '', using Maxwell's equation, and] 'σ', this in turn can be combined with] s 'to obtain the electrical stress energy tensor' t 'used In general relativity for

 prakruti main sabhi rasinic padaarth saadhaarant: thos, drav or gas tathaa plasma - in chaar avasthaaon main paae jate hai
 Fluids and gases can flow, but solids do not flow
 lacheele thos padaarthon main aaytan athwa aakaar ko vikrut karne se pratibal utpann hota he
 Deformation and stress are mutually proportional to minor deformations
 is gun ke kaaran lacheele thos ek nishchit maan tak ke bahari balon ko sanbhaalane kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Fluids and gases are called liquids due to their properties of flow
 ye padaarth kartan balon ko sanbhaalane main aksham hote hai or gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ke kaaran pravaahit hokar jis baratan main rakhe rahete hai, usee kaa aakaar dhaaran kar lete hai
 The mechanical distinction between solid and liquid is not very clear
 bahut se padaarth, visheshat: ucch koti ke bahulak ke yantric gun, shyaan taral or lacheele thos ke gunon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 a critical temperature is found for each substance, which, when exceeded, can only remain in the liquid state
 kranthik taap par padaarth kii drav or gas avasthaa main vishesh antar nahin rah jaataa
 At every temperature below this, some of its vapor is present along with the fluid and this vapor also has a certain pressure
 is dabaav ko vaashp dabaav kehete hai
 The maximum value of vapor pressure at each temperature is fixed
 is adhiktam dabaav ko samprukt-vaashp-dabaav ke baraabar athwa usase adhik ho, to drav sthaayee rahata he
 If the upper pressure is less than the combined vapor pressure of the fluid, then the fluid is temporary
 samprukt-vaashp-dabaav taap ke badhane se badhata he
 At the temperature at which the fluid-pressure-vapor pressure becomes equal to the pressure of the external environment, the fluid evaporates very rapidly
 is taap ko drav kaa kvathanank kehete hai
 If the external pressure is absolutely constant then the fluid below the boiling point is permanent
 kvathanank par pahunchne par yah khaulane lagata he
 In this case, it starts exploiting the heat and converts it from a liquid state to a gas state
 kvathanank par drav ke ikai dravyaman ko drav se purnat: gas main parivartit karne ke liye jitne calories ooshmaa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, use drav ke vashpibhawan kii gupt ooshmaa kehete hai
 Its value varies for different liquids
 ek niyat dabaav par thos or drav donon rup saath saath ek nishchit taap par paae ja sakate hai
 This heat is called the liquid's icepoint or solid's liquid point
 dravnank par padaarth ke ikai dravyaman ko thos se purnat: drav main parivartit karne main jitani ooshmaa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, use thos ke galan kii gupt ooshmaa kehete hai
 No fixed melting point is found for amorphous substances
 ve garam karne par dhire dhire mulaayam hote jate hai or phir drav avasthaa main aa jate hai
 Other substances such as glass and glass behave similarly
 ek niyat taap or niyat dabaav par prayek dravya kii teenon avasthaaen ek saath vidyaman rah sakati hai
 In the diagram drawn between pressure and heat, these fixed heat and pressure are represented by a point
 is bindu ko drav kaa trik bindu kehete hai
 The fluid remains unstable at lower pressures than in the sacrum
 yadi kisi thos ko trik vindu kii apeksha nimna dabaav par rakhkar garam kiya jaae to vah bina drav bane hi vaashp main parivartit ho jaataa he, arthath urdhvpaatit ho jaataa he
 In the free surface of the fluid, which is in contact with the vapor or normal air of that fluid, a special property is found, due to which this surface behaves like a thinner membrane
 is gun ko prishth tanaav kehete hai
 The surface area of the fluid is as low as possible due to surface tension
 kisi die aaytan ke liye sabase kam kshetrafal ek gole kaa hota he
 Therefore, in such situations when external forces can be considered negligible, the drops of liquid are round
 jab koi drav kisi thos, yaa anya kisi amishray drav, ke sampark main aata he to bhi sampark tal par tanaav utpann hota he
 Normally any substance can be obtained in only one type of liquid form, but there are some exceptions, such as two types of helium fluid can be obtained by liquefying helium gas
 usee prakaar para-azoxi-enisol prakaashat: vishamdaishik drav ke rup main, crystalia avasthaa main tathaa saamaanya drav ke rup main bhi praapt ho saktaa he
 The molecules of each material are attracted to each other
 is aakarshan ko antaranuk aakarshan kehete hai
 Due to this, the molecules of a material are collected
 dravya ke anuon par ek vikarshan bal bhi lagata rahata he
 This force prevents the molecules from coming too close to each other
 thos ke anuon ke bich ye bal prabal hote hai
 Their values are small in liquids and almost negligible in gases
 crystalia thos kii lakshanik visheshta yah hoti he ki usamen nikat paraas or dur paraas main bhi anuon kii ek suniyojit vyavastha bani hoti he
 Some molecules combine into small groups
 in guton kii aantarik rachana ek si hoti he
 These are called unicellular cells
 yahi nikat paraas kii vyavastha kehalaati he
 The system of far-range means that the unicellular cells of a crystalline solid are also arranged in a particular way, that is, the arrangement of the unicellular is not arbitrary but recurrent
 drav or thos main mukhya bhed yahi he ki drav main doorparaas vyavastha bilkul nahin hoti he
 a near-constant arrangement can persist to some extent, so that the fluid also has an equal number of molecules around each molecule
 eks-kiran vivartan ke prayogon dwaara is prakaar kii nikat paraas vyavastha kii upasthiti vaigyanikon dwaara pramanit kii ja chuki he

 Earlier studies have mostly used the Lenard Jones potential
 dravon kaa vivar siddhant apekshaakrit naveen siddhant he
 Many fluids are electrophoresis
 inaki chaalakata kaa kaaran yah he ki inamen swatantra electron paae jate hai
 The electrodensity of liquid salts depends on their ionization
 anya drav do mukhya bhaagon main baante ja sakate hai
 Fluids that are attracted to the existing object are called polar and those that are not attracted are called inelastic
 vaastaviktaa yah he ki dhruviya dravon ke anu main sthaayee rup se kuch dvadhruv-aghurna hote hai, paratu adhruviya dravon ke anuon main aisa nahin hota
 Benzene is a polar fluid
 adhruviya dravon kaa paravaidyuthank 1 or 3 ke bich main paaya jaataa he
 Their field of view is equal to the square root of their radio frequency reflectance
 dhruviya dravon ke paravaidyuthank adhruviya dravon ke paravaidyutankon kii apeksha lagbhag 10 se 100 guna adhik hote hai, kintu inkaa vartanaank lagbhag utana hi hota he
 Fluids are generally isotropic
 dravon ke varnakram inhen padaarthon ke gasiy aanvik varnakramon se bahut kuch milte julate hai
 But the Raman and infrared spectrum of liquids are somewhat different from the corresponding gaseous spectrum
