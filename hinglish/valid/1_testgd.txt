 The ozone molecule absorbs UV light between 310 and 200 nm, causing the ozone to split into an oxygen atom and an O2 molecule
 ab oxigen parmaanu oxigen anu ke saath sanyojit hokar fir se ozon anu banaata he
 This is a continuous process that ends when an oxygen atom "recombines" with an ozone molecule to form two O2 molecules
 o + O3 → 2 O2 The total amount of ozone in the stratosphere is determined by a balance between photochemical production and recombination

 All of these have both natural and synthetic sources; at the present time, the majority of OH and NO
 It has a natural origin in the stratosphere, but human activity has resulted in dramatically higher increases in oxygen chlorine and bromine

 President of Precision Valve Corporation Robert Abplanalp wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine about Rowland's public statements complaining
 Despite this, most of the core assumptions made by Rowland and Molina were confirmed by laboratory measurements They were given and certified by direct observations in the stratosphere

 In addition to splitting the first vowel to the tune "good Morning to All" to accommodate the two syllables in the word "happy", "happy Birthday to you" and "good Morning to All" are positively similar
 The preceding suggests that a dividing tone used in "happy Birthday to You" should not qualify for additional copyright status
 Whether or not the word "good Morning" should be changed to "happy Birthday" is a copyright issue or not
 Other than the authors of "good morning to everyone", the word "good morning" was replaced by "happy birthday"

 With the approval of getting copyright rights in 2005, most recently in February 2008, PBS got permission to re-air the film
 bundelkhand vindhyaachal kii upavyakaon kaa pradesh he
 This kernel has many low branches - branches
 iske dakshin bhaag main mekal, purv main camor, uttar-purv main kenjua, madhya main saarang or panna tathaa pashchim main bhimtor or pir jaisi giri shikhaain hai
 This section is a stretch of rivers flowing on bright sand or inaccessible girths with rippling ponds, rivulets and wide gully, taking ripples
 sindh, betwa, dhasaan, ken tathaa narmada is bhaag kii mukhya nadiyaan hai
 Of these, the flow of the first four rivers is towards the north and the flow of the Narmada is towards the west in the east
 pratham chaar nadiyaan yamuna main mil jaati hai
 The Narmada meets the West Sea
 is kshetra main prakruti ne vistaar lekar apana soundarya chhitakaaya he
 Bundelkhand is rich in iron, gold, silver, glass, diamond, emerald etc
 iske alaava yahan chuunaa kaa pathar bhi prachur maatra main paaya jaataa he
 The names of the rocks found on the Vindhaya mountain are famous with the names of the places around it such as - Limestone of Mandar, Chip of Gannaur Garh, Lima of Rewa and Panna, Chip of Vijaygarh etc
 jabalpur ke aasapaas paaya jane vaala gora pathar bhi kaaphi prasiddh he
 The land of this province is considered good for cultivation of fruits, tobacco and papaya in addition to food crops
 yahan ke wanon main sarai, sagon, mahua, chaar, hari, bahera, aanwala, ghatahar, khayr, dhubain, mahalon, paakar, babul, karaunda, simal aadi ke vriksh adhik hote hai
 Bundelkhand has more villages
 unke naam vrikshon, jalaashyon, pashuon, pakshiyon, ghaas-paat athwa sthaan vishesh ke nikat hone vaali koi dhwani vishesh ke aadhaar par rakhe gayi prathit hote hai
 Since there is a lot of trees in this part and reservoirs are many, so most of the names are related to these
 vrikshon main visheshkar pipal, aam, jamun, umar, imali, bel, ber, mahua, chaar or hardu par bahut se naam hai
 Only Jabalpur in which there are usually 50 villages called Pipariya, Piparhata
 isi prakaar anek jamuniyaan, umeria, imali athwa isnia hai
 The names Ibari, Kua, Sagar, Jhiriya etc
 are based on the reservoirs
 jalashay suchak naamon se saath kahin-kahin vrikshon ke naam sanyukti hokar gram naam ban gayi hai
 Like Semratal, Amanro
 pashuon ke naam se bhi kai gaanv ke naam pade hai jaise rich se richi yaa richhai, hiran se hiranpuri
 The names of many villages are also made by combining the names of the animals and reservoirs in the place of trees, such as - Bagdabari, Hathisara, Gidhauta, Magarmuha, Jhinguri
 upyukt gram-naam-parichay se gyaat hota he ki graamon ke bade vicitra naam rakhe gayi hai jo kabhi kabhi hasyapad bhi lagata he
 a folk poet has said that the distance between the villages in close proximity, ie the distance between the nose and the ears, is a little - dhar-masaki or dharampura, lolkachaiya, vijaipura
 Lakhpatari is as far away as the nose and ears
 
 We get a glimpse of the past splendor of Bundelkhand with the stone crafts and architecture located here today
 yahan pragaitihaasik kaal ke adivaasiyon dwaara puji jane vaali murtiyan bundelkhand praapt hui hai
 From the point of view of art, they are not much value, but to study the initial form of sculpture, these sculptures have great importance
 bundelkhand ke vibhinn sthanon main surkh rang kii chitrakaari bhi milti he
 Its color is so sure that it has not deteriorated yet
 inamen manushyon or ghodon ke chitra hai
 Historians determine its historical past

 Inscriptions have also been received
 samraat ashok ne is praant par bhi apana adhikaar sthapit kiya tha or dharm prachaar hetu shilalekhon par dharm prashastiyaan uttakeern karain thi
 From the third century to the thirteenth century, the architecture was created in this province that is still alive in the works of Kalinga and Khajurahas
 kaling kii kala chandeli kaal kii he
 Khajuraho is earlier than that, because the Chinese traveler Xuanzang also wrote that the temple is in Khajuraho
 kadaachit chandelon ne un puraatan mandiron kaa jirnoddhar kara kar prashastiyaan ankit kii hongi
 The huge temple of Khajuraho, Vishnurmurti of Deogarh, the old palace of Datia, Jupiter Kund of Panna, Madanasagar of Jatara, etc
 are the questions of architecture
 ajaigarh, barua sagar, talbehat, karaira aadi main bhi kala kii prachurtaa he
 In Khajuraho, as a group of twenty temples, the concept of Kavitra has been brought down to the earth by idolization
 shilpi kaa swapn maano saakaar ho gaya he
 Decorated with its huge pavilions, gaps, tall towers adorned with amalak peaks and stupas, and its numerous unmatched inscriptions, this group of temples is today inviting countless people to visit
 mandir ke baahar or bheetar donon ore kii deevaaron devataaon, apsaraon, sandariyon, vidyadharon, yugal-meethunon, gaj or shardulon kii sundar kala-kritiyon se sajaai gai hai
 The craftsmen of Khajurahas are unique creations, their female idols are so beautiful, looking at them, it seems as if Chetan has woken up at the root with all his splendor
 itnaa sammohan he ki pashaan main jivan sapandan kaa bhram hone lagata he
 The craftsmen of Khajuraho have marked every form of life and emotion of the woman
 kabi shalamanjik ke rup main to kabhi apane premi ke saath kaam-krida tathaa bhogavilas karte, sakhiyon ke saath haas, parihaas or vaartalap karte, bacchon ko stanpan karaate, shringaar karte, sote, uthte-baithte, prayek sthiti main tanmay or bhav-vibhor hokar
 Massive semi-immersed eyes, advanced uros, heavy buttocks, many crooked zigzagas, liquid laughter floating on full lips, or a silent invitation to love in a smile are characteristic of feminine sculpture
 nagaudh ke nikat mumra gram kaa shiv mandir tathaa nachna gram ke sameep choumukhnath kaa mandir donon apane dhang ke hai
 Historians believe that these were built by the Naga dynasty Shaiv rulers
 nachna kaa shivalay naagkalin sthapaty kaa adbhut udhaaharan he
 In it, the scene of shiva-parvati on Mount Kailash is marked on the peaks
 kuch log mumra or nachna ke mandiron kii gananaa guptakaleen sthapaty kala main kiya karte hai
 Bizarre art archway is inscribed on the doors of these temples
 jabalpur jile main tigavaan gram main guptakaleen sundar vishnu mandir hai
 There is also an area of such art at many places in Sagar district
 binaa ke aas paas to iske bhandar hai, vishesh kar eran gram ke nikat hun rajya kaal main bundelkhand kii rajdhani thi
 Nearly eight miles west of Jabalpur is a village called Tevar
 iske aas-paas devalayon or khandaharon ke avshisht paye jate hai, jinamein ukt sthaan ke beete vaibhav kii jhalak milti he
 Many idols are found here, among which Vajrapani, Lord Buddha and Jain Tirthankar are special

 The tavar which is called Tripuri has been the predominance of Kalchuris
 kintu kuch murtiyon tathaa ek pracheen baawali ko chhod kar anya koi bhaagnavshesh nahin bachaa he
 a little away from Tripuri, Karnabel has some ancient Bhaganavasheth
 tripari hi chedi kii rajdhani thi
 The Garha village near Jabalpur is full of the remains of the ancient "garha Mandal Rajya"
 gadha-mandla gaudon kaa rajya tha goud raja kalchuriyon ke baad hue hai
 Alexander Kaninham has detailed the Kalachuri architecture near Jabalpur in his report
 prasiddh anveshak rakhaldas bannerjee ne bi is vishay par ek atyant gaveshnapurna granth likhaa he
 There are also many artistic monuments in villages like Sheepghat and Nandchand
 bhedaghat main prasidd "chaunsath yogini' kaa mandir
 Its shape is round
 isame 81 murtiyon ke rakhane ke liye khand bane hai
 It is built in the 10th century
 mandir ke bheetar bich main alhan mandir he
 The kind of art found in temples and idols in all these places, it is clear that Bundelkhand has indeed been art-land
 murtiyon kii mukhmudra, sharir kii banaavat, vaksh pradesh, kati, anguliyaan tata nasika aadi kii banaavat se ucchkoti kii kala kaa parichay miltaa he
 The sculptures found in many places have so much efficiency that the entire power of the craftsman's chisel-hammer is lost in it
 sharir par ke rome tak darshaye ja sake hai
 Not only this, transparent cloth can also be shown

 Guru Gobind Singh completed the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred text of the Sikhs, and embellished them as a Guru
 bichitra naatak ko unki aatmakatha mana jaataa he
 This is the most important source of information about his life
 yah dasam granth kaa ek bhaag he
 The Dasam Granth is the name of a compilation of the works of Guru Gobind Singh
 unhone mughalon yaa unke sahyogiyon ke saath 14 yuddh lade
 He sacrificed the entire family for the sake of religion, for which he is also known as 'sarvasvadani'
 iske atirikt jansadharan main ve kalgidhar, dashamesh, bazaanvaale aadi kai naam, upnaam va oopaadhiyon se bhi jane jate hai
 While Guru Gobind Singh was unique in the sacrificial tradition of the world, he himself was a great writer, original thinker, and also a scholar of many languages including Sanskrit
 unhone swayan kai granthon kii rachana kii
 He was the patron of scholars
 unke darbar main 52 kaviyon tathaa lekhakon kii upasthiti rahati thi, isiilie unhen 'sant sipaahi' bhi kaha jaataa tha
 He was a unique confluence of devotion and power
 unhone sadaa prem, ekta, bhaichaare kaa sandesh diya
 Even if someone tried to harm Guruji, he defeated him with his tolerance, sweetness, mildness
 guruji kii manyata thi ki manushya ko kisi ko daraana bhi nahin chahie or na kisi se darana chahie
 He preaches in his speech, he does not give to Kahu, not fearfully
 ve balykaal se hi saral, sahaj, bhakthi-bhav vaale karmyogi the
 His voice was filled with a feeling of sweetness, simplicity, courtesy and quietness
 unke jivan kaa pratham darshan hi tha ki dharm kaa maarg satya kaa maarg he or satya kii sadaiv vijay hoti he
 Guru Govind Singh was born on 22 December 1666 in Patna, the home of the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur and Mata Gujri
 jab vah paidaa hue the us samay unke pita assam main dharm upadesh ko gayi the
 His childhood name was Govind Rai
 patna main jis ghar main unka janm hua tha or jisamen unhone apane pratham chaar varsh bitaaye the, vahiin par ab takhat shri patna sahib sthit he
 In 1670, his family returned to Punjab
 march 1672 main unka parivaar himalay ke shivalik pahadiyon main sthit chakk nanaki naamak sthaan par aa gaya
 It was here that his education started
 unhone farsi, sanskrit kii shiksha lee or ek yoddha banane ke liye sainya kaushal siikhaa
 Chak Nanaki is now called Anandpur Sahib
 govind raay ji nity prati anandpur sahab main aadhyatmik anand baantate, maanav maatr main naitikta, nidarta tathaa aadhyatmik jagriti kaa sandesh dete the
 Anandpur was virtually Anand Dham
 yahan par sabhi log varna, rang, jati, sampradaay ke bhedbhaav ke bina samta, samanta evam samarasata kaa alokik gyaan praapt karte the
 Govind ji was the idol of peace, forgiveness and tolerance

 After this, Govind Singh was declared the tenth Guru of the Sikhs on 29 March 1676 on the day of Baisakhi
 10wein guru banane ke baad bhi aapaki shiksha jari rahi
 Education included writing, reading, horse riding and bow riding etc
 1684 main unhone chandi di waar ki rachana kii
 Till 1685 you stayed at a place called Paonta on the banks of river Yamuna
 guru gobind singh kii teen patniyaan thim
 On 21 June 1677, at the age of 10, he was married to Mata Jeeto in Basantgarh, 10 km from Anandpur
 un donon ke 3 putr hue jinke naam the – jujhar singh, joravar singh, fateh singh
 On April 4, 1684, at the age of 17, he was married to his second marriage to Mata Sundari at Anandpur
 unka ek betaa hua jiskaa naam tha ajit singh
 On 15 April 1700, at the age of 33, he married Mata Sahib Devan
 vaise to unka koi santan nahin tha par sikh dharm ke pannon par unka daur bhi bahut prabhaavshaalee rahaa
 In April 1685, at the invitation of Raja Mat Prakash of Sirmour this Sirmour belongs to Himanchal pradesh, Guru Gobind Singh shifted his residence to Paonta town of Sirmaur state
 sirmaur rajya ke gajet ke anusaar, raja bhim chand ke saath matbhed ke kaaran guru ji ko anandpur sahib chhodane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya tha or ve vahaan se tokaa shahar chale gayi
 Mat Prakash invited Guru Ji from Toca to Nahan, the capital of Sirmaur
 naahan se vah paanvata ke liye ravaanaa huai| mat prakaash ne gadhwal ke raja fateh shah ke khilaaf apni sthiti majboot karne ke uddeshy se guru ji ko apane rajya main aamantrit kiya tha
 On the request of Raja Mat Prakash, Guru Ji constructed a fort in Paonta with the help of his followers in a very short time
 guru ji paanvata main lagbhag teen saal ke liye rahe or kai granthon kii rachana kii
 At the Battle of Nadaun in 1687, the armies of Guru Gobind Singh, Bhim Chand, and other allied hill kings defeated the armies of Alif Khan and his allies
 vicitra naatak or bhatta wahis ke anusaar, nadaun par bane vyas nadi ke tat par guru gobind singh aath dinon tak rahe or vibhinn mahatvapurn sainya pramukhon kaa daura kiya
 a few days after the Battle of Bhangani, Rani Champa requested Guruji to return to Anandpur Sahib which Guruji accepted
 vah november 1688 main waapas anandpur sahib pahunch gayi
 In 1695, Dilawar Khan sent his son Hussain Khan to attack Anandpur Sahib
 mughal sena haar gai or hossain khan maaraa gaya
 After Hussain's death, Dilawar Khan sent his men, Jujhar Hada and Chandel Rai, to Shivalik
 haalanki, ve jaswaal ke gaj singh se haar gaye the
 Such developments in the mountainous region became a cause of concern for the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and he sent forces with his son to restore Mughal authority in the area
 guru gobind singh ji kaa netritv sikh samudaay ke itihaas main bahut kuch nayaa le kar aayaa
 He created Khalsa, a collective form of Sikhism's duly initiated followers on the day of Baisakhi in 1699
 sikh samudaay ke ek sabha main unhone sabake saamne puchha – "koun apane sar kaa balidaan dena chahta he"? usee samay ek swayamsevak is baat ke liye raji ho gaya or guru gobind singh use tamboo main le gaye or kuch der baad waapas laute ek khun lage hue talwaar ke saath
 The Guru again asked the people of that crowd the same question again and likewise another person agreed and went with them but when they came out of the tent, the blood-stained sword was in their hands
 usee prakaar paanchavaa swayamsevak jab unke saath tamboo ke bheetar gaya, kuch der baad guru gobind singh sabhi jivit sevakon ke saath waapas laute or unhone unhen panj pyaare yaa pehle khalsa kaa naam diya
 After that Guru Gobind Ji took an iron bowl and mixed it with water and sugar and mixed it with a double-edged sword and gave it the name of Amrit
 pehle 5 khalsa ke banane ke baad unhen chhathvaan khalsa kaa naam diya gaya jiske baad unka naam guru gobind raay se guru gobind singh rakh diya gaya
 He explained the importance of the five kakaras for the Khalsa and said - kesha, comb, kadha, kirpan, kutkara
 idhar 27 disambar san 1704 ko donon chote sahibajaade or jorawatsingh va fatehsinghji ko deevaaron main chunavaa diya gaya
 When Guruji came to know about this, he wrote a Zafarnama to Aurangzeb, in which he warned Aurangzeb that the Khalsa Panth was ready to destroy your empire
 8 may san 1705 main 'muktsar' naamak sthaan par mughalon se bhayanak yuddh hua, jisamen guruji kii jeet hui
 In October 1706, Guruji went to the south where you came to know the death of Aurangzeb
 aurangzeb ne marate samay ek shikaayat patr likhaa tha
 Surprisingly, the one who had looted everything, he was writing the Fathnama and the one who had everything is writing a spurious Naama
 iskaa kaaran tha sachai
 Guruji always waged war against tyranny and not for his personal gain
 aurangzeb kii mrityu ke baad aapane bahadurshah ko badshaah banane main madad kii
 The relationship between Guruji and Bahadur Shah was very good
 in sambandhon ko dekhakar sarhad kaa nawab vajit khan ghabara gaya
 So he put two Pathans behind Guruji
 in pathaanon ne guruji par dhokhe se ghaatak waar kiya, jisase 7 oktober 1708 main guruji nanded sahib main divya jyoti main leen ho gaye
 At the end, you asked the Sikhs to consider the Guru Granth Sahib as their Guru and also bowed themselves
 guruji ke baad madhodas ne, jise guruji ne sikh banaaya bandasingh bahadur naam diya tha, sarhad par akraman kiya or atyaachaariyon kii eent se eent baja di
 About Guru Govindji Lala Daulatarai, a staunch Arya Samaji, writes, 'I could have written a lot about Swami Vivekananda, Swami Dayanand, Paramahamsa etc
, but i cannot write about them which are full men
 Are not
 mujhe purna purush ke sabhi gun guru govindsingh main milte hai
 'therefore Lala Daulatrai has written a good book about Guru Govind Singhji called Purna Purush
 isi prakaar mohammad abdul latif bhi likhata he ki jab main guru govindsinghji ke vyaktitv ke bare main sochataa hoon to mujhe samaj main nahin aata ki unke kis pahalu kaa varnan karuun
 Sometimes he looks at me as a Mahadhiraja, sometimes a Mahadani, sometimes a Fakir, sometimes he is a Guru
 sikhon ke das guru hai
 While fighting a murderer, Guru Gobind Singh ji suffered a deep injury to the heart above the chest
 jiske kaaran 18 oktober, 1708 ko 42 varsh kii aayu main nanded main unki mrityu ho gayi

 In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem or Pythagoras' theorem is a relationship between the three sides of a right triangle in Euclidean geometry
 is prameya ko aamtaur par ek sameekaran ke rup main likhaa jaataa he: Where c represents the length of the hypotenuse and a and b represent the length of the other two sides
 shabdon main: The square of the hypotenuse of the right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides
 paaythagorian prameya unani ganitagya paaythagoras ke naam par rakhaa gaya he, jinhen rivaaj se apni apni khoj or pramaan kaa shrey diya jaataa he, haalanki yah aksar tark kiya gaya he kii is siddhant kii jaankaree unase purv tithi kii he
 
 agar ham karn kii lambaai ko c or anya do parshvon kii lambaai ko a or b lete hai, to prameya ko sameekaran ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: Or, solve for c: yadi c pehle se hi diya gaya he or ek pair kii lambaai sthapit karnaa ho, to nimnlikhit sameekaran kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he : or yah sameekaran samakon trikon ke teenon parshvon ke bich ek saral rishta pradaan karata he taaki yadi koi bhi donon parshvon kii lambaai kaa pataa ho, to tisare parshv kii lambaai kaa pataa kiya ja saktaa he
 The generalization of this theorem is the law of cosines, which allow the length of the third side of any triangle to be calculated if the length of the two sides and the angle between them are given
 If the angle between the two sides is a right angle
 So he can use the Pythagorean theorem
 yah ek aisa prameya he jiske anya kii tulana main adhik saboot gyaat ho sakate hai ; elisha scot loomis dwaara, paaythagorian prastaav kitaab main, 367 saboot shaamil hai
 Some theorems based on trigonometric identities have proposed this theorem as a proof
 haalanki, kyunki sabhi moulik trigonometric pahchaan ko paaythagorian prameya ke upyog se sabit kiya ja chukaa he, yahan koi trigonometric saboot nahin ho saktaa he
 Like most proofs of the Pythagorean theorem, it is based on the similarity of the sides of two identical triangles
 ABC ko ek samakon trikon maanate hai, jisamen samakon c main sthit he, jaisaa akruti main dikhaaya gaya he
 We draw height from point c and call its intersection with AB side H
 yah nayaa trikon ACH hamaare trikon ABC ke samaan he, kyonki un donon main hi samakon he or ve a kone unka hissaa he, iskaa matlab he kii teesraa kone bhi donon trikon main samaan he
 By a similar logic, the triangle CBH is also similar to ABC
 yah samanta do anupaat kaa netritv karti he
 
: jaise And inhen aise bhi likhaa ja saktaa he By summarizing these two similarities, we get anya shabdon main, paaythagorian prameya: In Euclid's Elements, Proposition 47 of Book 1, the Pythagorean theorem is proved by an argument along the following lines
 A, B, c ko samakon trikon ke kone maanate hai, jisamen samakon a par hoga
 a se karn ke vipareet ek adholamb chhoden varg main karn par
wo rekha karn par varg ko do aaayaaton main vibhajit karti he, prayek kaa samaan kshetra he kyunki donon main se ek pairon main varg banataa he
 For formal proof, we need four primary lemmata: is saboot ke peeche sahaj vichaar, jo iskaa paalan karnaa aasaan bana saktaa he, ki upar ke do virgon ko ek hi aakaar ke samanaantar chaturbhuj main badla gaya he, phir modakar or baayen or daahine aayat ko nichle varg main badla gaya he, phir nirantar kshetra main
 The proof is as follows: yah saboot euclid ke tatwon main prastaav 1
47 ke rup main pesh hota he
 James A
 Garfield is credited with a novel algebraic proof: puraa samalamb bai varg kaa aadha he, to uskaa kshetrafal = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 Each area of triangle 1 and triangle 2 is ab / 2
 trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal c2 / 2 he or yah karn par varg kaa aadha he
 But also the area of triangle 3 = - isliye karn par varg = anya do parshvon ke virgon kaa jod he
 In this proof, one can add 4 copies of the square plus triangle on the hypotenuse as squares on the other two sides plus 4 copies of the triangle
 This proof has been recorded from China
 upar euclid ke saboot ke chitra se, ham teen samaan aankadon ko dekh sakate hai, prayek main "ek varg ke upar trikon" he
 Because the larger triangle is made up of two smaller triangles, its area is the sum of these two smaller ones
 samanta se, teen varg ek duusare ke saath usee anupaat main hai jaise vah teen trikon or isi tarah ke bade varg kaa kshetrafal do chote virgon ke kshetrafal kaa jod he
 Proof of anagrams is given by illustration and animation
 is udhaaharan main, har ek bade varg kaa kshetrafal 2 he
 In both, the area of the same triangle is removed
 shesh kshetron, a2 + b2 or c 2, baraabar hai
 QED yah saboot vastav main bahut aasaan he, lekin yah praarambhik nahin he, is arth main ki yah keval sabase buniyadi siddhant or yucalidian jyamiti ke pramayon par nirbhar nahin he
 In particular, while it is very easy to give the formula for the area of triangles and squares, it is not easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of the areas of its pieces
 vastav main, aavashyak gun sabit karnaa paaythagorian prameya siddh karne kii tulana main kathin he 
vastav main, yah kathinaayee sabhi saadhaaran kshetra shaamil yucalidian saboot ko prabhavit karata he; udhaaharan ke liye, ek samakon trikon kaa kshetra paane ke liye ek dharna shaamil he ki yah ek hi oonchai or tal ke ek aayat kaa aadha kshetra he
 For this reason, axiomatic introduction to geometry generally uses another proof based on the similarity of triangles
 is paaythagorian prameya kaa teesraa graphic chithran main karn kaa varg parshvon ke varg main feet baithta he
 a related evidence may show that the restored parts are identical to the original and, because the sum of the same is the same, that their areas are also the same
 yah dikhaane ke liye kii ek varg hi parinaam he, hame nae parshvon kii lambaai ko c ke baraabar dikhaanaa padegaa
dhyaan den kii is saboot ke kaam karne ke liye, hame chote varg ko or adhik hisson main kaatane ke tareeke ko sanbhaalane ke liye rasta pradaan karnaa hoga chunki parshv or chote hote jaayenge
 The algebraic variation of this proof is provided by the following argument
 chithran ko dekhte hue jo ek bada varg he jiske konon main samaan samakon trikon he, in chaar trikon main prayek kaa kshetra c ke saath ek kone ke dwaara diya gaya he
 The A-lateral angles and B-lateral angles of these triangles are the supplementary angles, each of the angles of the blue region are right angles, making the area a square whose side length is C
 is varg kaa kshetrafal he C2 
is tarah samast kaa kshetra diya jaataa he: However, the length of the sides of the larger square is a + B, we can calculate its area as 2, which extends into A2 + 2AB + B2
 paaythagorian prameya main pahunchaa ja saktaa he nimnlikhit chitra ke adhyayan se kii ek parshv main parivartan kaise karn main ek parivartan ke utpaadan kar saktaa he or ek thoda kalan kaa upyog karke
 As a result of the change in side of a, da, trikon kii samanta or antar main badlaav ke liye
isliye On the separation of variables
 parshv b main parivartan ke liye ek doosraa kaarykaal jodne kaa parinaam he
 Consolidated returns jab a = 0 tab c = b, to b 2 "nirantar" he
 So jaise dekha ja saktaa he, parivartan or parshvon ke bich vishesh anupaat ke kaaran he yah varg jabaki parshvon main parivartan kii swatantra yogadan kaa parinaam raashi he jo jyamitiya saakshyon se spasht nahin he
 From this given ratio it can be shown that the changes in the sides are inversely proportional to the sides
 is vibhedak sameekaran suzav detaa he kii yah prameya sambandhit parivartan ke kaaran he or iske vyutpatti lagbhag line abhinn abhikalan ke samaan he
 This quantity da and dc are very small changes in a and c respectively
 lekin ham iske badale vaastavik sankhya Δa and Δc kaa upyog karte hai, tab unke anupaat kii seemaa da / dc he jab unka aakaar shunya nikatataa, vyutpanni or c / a bhi nikatataa he, trikon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa anupaat or vibhedak sameekaran kaa parinaam pataa chalata he
 The antonym of this theorem is also true: kisi bhi teen dhanatmak sankhya a, b or c aisi he a2 + b2 = c2, vahaan ek trikon maujuud he jiske parshv hai a, b or c or har aise trikon main parshvon ke bheech ek samakon he jinaki lambaai a or b he
 This antonym is present in the elements of Euclid
 kosine kii vidhi kaa prayog karke yah sabit kiya ja saktaa he, yaa nimnlikhit saboot ke dwaara: Let ABC be a triangle whose sides are a, b and c, with a2 + b2 = c2
 We have to prove that the angles between a and b sides are right angles
 ham ek or trikon kaa nirmaan karte hai jisamen parshvon ke bich ek samakon he jisaki lambaai a or b he
 From the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse length of this triangle is also c
 chunki donon trikon ke parshvon kii ek hi lambaai he a, b or c, ve anukool hai or isliye unka ek hi kone hona chahie
isliye, jin parshvon kii lambaai a or b he hamaare mul trikon main unke bich kaa kone ek samakon he
 An approximation of the inverse of the Pythagorean theorem is a simple way of determining if a triangle is right-angled, obtuse, or acute, thus
 Where c is chosen as the longest of the three sides: ek paaythagorian tripal main teen sakaaratmak purnank hai a, b or c, jaise kii a2 + b2 = c2
anya shabdon main, ek paaythagorian tripal ek samakon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa varnan karata he jahaan teenon parshv kii purnank lambaai he
 Evidence from large stone monuments in Northern Europe shows that such triplets were known before the discovery of writing
 is tarah ke tripal saamanytah se likhe gaye hai 
kuch prasiddh udhaaharan hai or ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, paaythagorian prameya ke parinaamon main se ek he ki taratamyaheen lambaai, jaise kii 2 kaa vargamul, banaaya ja saktaa he
 a right angle whose legs are equal to one unit has the square root of its hypotenuse length 2
 yah saboot ki 2 kaa vargamul tarkahin he lambey samay se yojit vishwaas ke vipareet tha ki sab kuch tarksangat tha
 According to legend, Hippasus, who first proved the irrationality of the square root of two, was drowned at sea as a result
 kaatizian nirdeshaank main duurastha formula ko paaythagorian prameya se se praapt kiya gaya he
 If and are points in the square, then the distance between them, also called the Euclidean distance, is given by atirikt saamanytah se, yucalidian main n-antar, do binduon ke bich kii yucalidian duuri, a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,} or a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,}, paaythagorian prameya kaa upyog karte hue, paribhaashit kiya gaya he: The Pythagorean theorem was generalized among Euclid's elements: agar koi ek samaan aankade khadaa karata he ek samakon trikon ke parshvon main, to do chhoton ke kshetron kaa jod bade ke kshetrafal ke baraabar he
 The Pythagorean theorem is a special case of the more general theorem related to the length of the sides, the method of cosine: is jatil aantarik utpaada antariksh main do vector v or w diya jaae, to paaythagorian prameya nimnlikhit rup le leti he: In particular, || v + w || 2 = || v || 2 + || w || 2 if v and w are rectangles, although the antonym is not necessarily true
 ganitiya preran kaa prayog karke, pichhlaa parinaam kisi parimit sankhya ke jodon main ayty vector tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Any finite number of k can be increased

, v n ko vector maanate hai ek aantarik utpaada antariksh main jisamen = 0 jab 1 ≤ i γ hota he
 Therefore, a 2 + b 2> c 2 is
 jin trikon main ek obtyus kone hota he, α + β < γ hota he
 Therefore, a 2 + b 2 <c 2 is
 edsjar disxtra ne is prastaav ko acut, samakon or obtyus trikon ke bare main is bhashaa main kaha he: Where angle α is opposite to lateral a, angle β is opposite to lateral b and angle γ is opposite to lateral c
 yucalidian jyamiti ke siddhant se paaythagorian prameya se praapt hua he, vastav main, upar bataae paaythagorian prameya kaa yucalidian prakaar bina yucalidian jyamiti ke nahin hota he
 Is shown to be equivalent to self-respect
 ) udhaaharan ke liye, goleey jyamiti main, octate se simit ikai kshetra ke samakon trikon ke teenon parshvon kii lambaai π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} ke baraabar he; yucalidian paaythagorian prameya kaa ulanghan karti he kyunki π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} This means that in the Euclidean theorem, the Pythagorean theorem must take a different form from the Euclidean theorem
 Here two cases have to be considered - spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry; In every case, like the Euclidean case, the law of proper cosine results in: ek gola jisaki trigya r he usapar koi bhi samakon trikon ke liye, paaythagorian prameya yah rup letaa he This equation can be derived as a special case of the spherical law of cosines
 is kosine samaaroh ke liye mcclaurin shrinkhalaa kaa upyog karke, yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he ki trigya r anantta tak pahunchataa he, ke rup main he, paaythagorian prameya kaa golakaar rup yucalidian rup tak pahunchataa he
 For any triangle in this hyperbolic plane, the Pythagorean theorem takes this form jahaan cosh ke atishyoktipurna kosine he
 Using the mclaurin series for this function, it can be shown that the exaggerated form of the Pythagorean theorem is closely related to the Euclidean form, as the hyperbolic triangle becomes very small
 atishyoktipurna jyamiti main, ek samakon trikon ke liye bhi likhaa ja saktaa he, Where a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} is the angle of equality of the line segment now that a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} where μ is the multiplication distance function
 atishyoktipurna trikonmiti main, sin ke kone kii samanta santusht karata he Thus, this equation takes the form jahaan a, b, and c samakon trikon ke parshvon kii ganaatmak dooriyaan hai 
 The distance between the points {and {in 3 dimensions is √2 + 2)] 2 + 2) = √2 + 2 + 2) and similarly for 4 or more dimensions

 The history of this theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of the Pythagorean triple, knowledge of the relationship between right triangle triangles, knowledge of the relationship between adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem

 In the United States, Henry Coles and Fredrik Clements developed ideas of vegetative rot in the early 20th century
 klement ab amaanya superarganism ke rup main vanaspati samudaay ke varnan ke liye prasiddh he
 He argued that just as all the organisms in a person work together to help the body work well and which develop together as a person becomes an adult, similarly in the vegetative community, every caste is very closely coordinated and Develops and co-ordinates with synergy and pushes the vegetation community to a defined and predetermined end state

 Contrary to Clements, many situational scientists have shown that the individual hypothesis, which states that the vegetation community is the total accumulation of a group of species reacting to the environment, is correct and decreases simultaneously in time and space
 remenski ne rus main yah vichaar prastut kiya or 1926 main henry gliyasana ne united stats main ise ek paper main viksit kiya

 In studies of three very different montane ecosystems, Whitaker showed that castes react primarily to the environment and have no coordination with other nearby castes
 Other work, particularly on paleobotany, supports this idea over large temporal and spatial scales
 1960 ke dashak se, vanaspatilok par adhiktar shodh kaaryaatmak paristhitishastra ke vishyon par kendrit ho gaya he
 In the functional framework, taxonomy is of little importance and all research focuses on the species' anatomical, anatomical, and anatomical classification, and its purpose is to predict how specific groups will behave toward different environmental variables
 The basis of such an approach is the assumption that high levels of phylogenetic taxonomy and large spatial scales often do not have a strong correlation between phylogenetic expectation and environmental adaptation, particularly due to centripetal evolution and adapted radiation
 kaaryaatmak vargeekaran 1930 ke dashak main rankier ke epical meristemon ke sthaan par aadhaarit paudhon ke samoohon main vibhaajan ke saath shuru hua

 In the year 1885, he returned home and started teaching in Presidency College as Assistant Professor of Physics
 yahaan vah 1915 tak rahe
 At that time, Indian teachers were paid one third of the salary of British teachers

 German physicist Heinrich Hertz experimented with the existence of electromagnetic waves in free space in 1888
 iske baad, loj ne hertz kaa kaam jari rakhaa or june 1894 main ek smaraneey vyaakhyaan diya or use pustak ke rup main prakashit kiya
 Lodge's work attracted the attention of scientists from various countries, including Bose of India
 bose ke microwave anusandhan kaa pehali ullekhneey pahalu yah tha ki unhone tarang dairdhya ko millimetre str par laa diya 
 They understood the loss of long wavelength light waves to study the properties of light
 1893 main, nicola testla ne pehle saarvajanik radio sanchaar kaa pradarshan kiya
 a year later, during a November 1894 public demonstration in Kolkata, Bose used a millimeter range microwave wave to fire ammunition and ring a bell

 Bose wrote in a Bengali essay, 'invisible Light', "invisible light can easily pass through brick walls, buildings etc
, so the message can be transmitted through light without wires
 " rus main popov ne aisa hi ek prayog kiya
 Bose's first scientific article "on the polarization of electric rays by double refractory crystals" was sent to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895, within a year of the Lodge article

 The electrician immediately commented on Bose's 'coherer'
 
 angreji patrika electrician se uddhrut tippanee he: Bose planned to better his "coherer" but never thought about the patent
 bose ne apane prayog us samay kiye the jab radio ek sampark madhyam ke taur par viksit ho rahaa tha
 Bose's work on radio microwave optics was not related to radio communication, but the improvements he made and the facts he wrote about it influenced other radio inventors
 us daur main 1894 ke ant main guglielmo marconi ek radio system par kaam kar rahe the jo wireles telegraphy ke liye vishith rup dizine kiya ja rahaa tha
 By early 1896, the system was transmitting radio signals far beyond the range indicated by physics

 After this, there was no research on electromagnetic waves of millimeter length for the next 50 years
 1897 main bose ne landan ke royal institushan main apane millimetre tarango par kiye hue shodh kii varnana di thi
 He used waveguides, horn antennas, die -lectric lenses, different polarizers and semiconductors with frequencies up to 60 ghz - in his research

 He had said that Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose was 60 years ahead of his time
 asal main bose ne hi p - tip or n - tip semiconductor ke astitv kaa purvanumaan kiya tha
 His biggest contribution in the field of biophysics was that he showed that the stimulation of plants is transmitted through the electrical medium and not through the chemical medium
 baad main in daavon ko vaigyanik proyogo ke madhyam se sach sabit kiya gaya tha
 Acharya Bose first studied the effect of microwave on vegetative tissue
 unhone paudhon par badalte hue mausam se hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 Along with this, he also studied the effect of chemical inhibitors on plants and the effect of plants on changing temperatures

 'vasudev' kaaljayi kathakaar evam manishi donarendra kohli dwaara rachit prasiddh upanyaas he
 Vasudev and Devaki are well-known names in India's mythological legends
 krishna ke mata-pita ke rup main unhen sabhi jaanate hai
 However, there is little discussion about them in detail
 prakhyat upanyaaskaar narendra kohli ne apane upanyaas ‘vasudev’ ke dwaara is kami ko puraa karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 He describes the lifetime of vasudev-devaki in which he sees visions of extreme life
 vasudev or devaki ke vivaah se lekar kansa vadh tak ke vibhinn ghatnakramon kaa ullekh karte hue lekhak ne tatkaaleen saamaajik, raajnneetik paristhitiyon ko bhi darshane kaa ek safal prayaas kiya he
 The story of this novel is not of 'vasudev', but of 'vasudev'
 vyakti ke dharaatal par vah charitra kii shuddhta kii ore bad rahe hai, samaaj ke dharaatal par saare prahaar apane vaksh par jhelkar jagriti kaa shankh phoonk rahe hai or raajnneeti ke dharaatal par ek sachche kshatriya ke rup main shastrbaddh ho sari dusht shaktiyon se loha le rahe hai
 It also has the Advaita Vedanta of the Upanishads, the Leela and devotion of the Bhagavata as well as the politics of the Mahabharata
 kintu narendra kohli kahin nahin bhoolatey ki yah kriti ek upanyaas he
 An original creative novel
 is adbhut katha main duruhata athwa jatilta nahin he
 This is today's novel
 aap isamen apni or apane hi yug kii atyant saras katha paaenge
 The plot which the author has taken in his novel, all things are well known
 uske sabhi mukhya prasang bharatiyon ko kanthsth hai
 Despite this, it is the writer's skill that there is no boredom anywhere in the novel
 puranic gaathaon main vasudev or devaki ke vivaah tathaa krishna janm ke bich na ke baraabar prasang hai
 But even in this vacuum, the author has written many themes in a very logical manner
 upanyaas vidha main lekhak kii pakad kaa yah pratik he
 There are a total of 62 chapters in the entire novel
 jinamein se 28 adhyay krishna ke janm se purv ke ghatnakram ke bare main hai
 And these 28 chapters are the most important chapters of the entire novel
 inamen devaki or vasudev kii charam jijeevishaa kaa lomaharshak vivaran badi kushalta se prastut kiya gaya he
 It would be a wonderful experience for any reader to read these chapters
 vasudev main puraana katha se koi ched-chhaad kiye bina, hi ise taarkikta kaa bana pahanaaya gaya he
 The opening of the prison doors at the time of Krishna's birth, such as the supernatural context in the story, has been made rational and contemporary
 krishna ke janm ke samay bhayankar varsha ke kaaran, apane pariwaron kii suraksha hetu chintit, karagaar ke samast prahari ghabrahat or jaldbaaji main dwaar khule chhodkar hi chale gaye
 The second episode is Krishna's holding the Govardhan Parvat on the finger, which is explained by the author with the face of Devaki, Krishna planted the gopals, dug up the soil and made the soil Govardhan higher, prepared the land so high On which all the gopals and cows can remain safe, flood water cannot reach there
 nayak vasudev anyaay ke sammukh na jhukne vaale or niti evam yukti se apane sangharsh ko jari rakhane kii shakti ke pratik hai
 At the time of the farewell after Devaki's marriage, the Magadha tantrik predicts that Kansa's life is troubled by Devaki's progeny, Kansa picks up a pillar to kill Devaki, seeing that there is opposition in the heart of anyone present there
 Do not think of kansa ke rajya main sarvatra bhay, asahaayta or vivashtaa hi vyaapt he
 In such a situation, what would Devaki's father Devak and his real brothers do to Khadg, not even protest against the tongue
 vasudev, jo devaki ke pati hai, krodhit nahin hote, santulit mastishk se vichaar karte hue paristhiti ko samajhane kaa prayaas karte hai
 When Kansa seized power from Maharaja Ugrasena and arrested him, no one came to his aid, who will help me? Therefore, by evaluating the entire situation in mind, they decide not only to power immediately but to work tactfully
 saahsee or niti kushal vasudev, kansa ko devaki kaa vadh karne se rokte hue, kansa ko vachan dete hai ki ve devaki kii prayek santan use saunp denge
 Vasudev is a believer, he has unwavering faith in God
 unki jijeevishaa preranadai he
 They say, i am a soldier and the soldier does not leave his weapon until his arm is cut
 ve santan kii raksha hetu athak prayaas karte hai, parantu asafal hi rahete hai
 Six children are slaughtered in front of them, but by securing Devaki's seventh womb in Rohini's body, they are able to send Rohini to Nandgaon
 aathvin santan ko ve swayan pratikul paristhiti main bhi nand ko saunpkar aate hai
 Even after this, Vasudev is not defeated in front of Kansa's power
 ve aahvaan karte hai, desh ke hit main apana hit dekhnaa siikho, desh surakshit nahin to hamamen se koi surakshit nahin he
 Even after the slaughter of Kansa, this novel does not end because the basis of iniquity is not Mathura King Kansa but Magadha King Jarasandha
 kansa vadh ke uparaant, yadavon ko samaapt karne or mathura ko nasht karne hetu jaraasandh ke akraman kii ashanka bad jaati he
 In the final scene of the novel, on the last page, Vasudev calls the Yadavas for a crusade
 is samay bhi ve akele hi sangharsh ke liye taiyaar hai, dharmayuddh main yah chintan nahin karnaa hota he ki koun mere saath aayega, koun nahin aayega
 Understand so much that i neither want to defy the war nor flee
 kshatriya tab tak sangharsh se peeche nahin hatataa, jab tak uskaa mastishk hi na cat jaae
 2 narendra kohli ne apane upanyaas 'vasudev' main sahitya main upekshit rahe paatr vasudev or devaki ko kendra main rakhkar katha kaa taana-bana buna he
 All the major characters of this novel - Vasudev, Devaki, Rohini, Nanda, Balaram have been presented before us in a new and stunning form
 yadhyapi lekhak ne puranic katha main koi parivartan nahin kiya he, tathaapi sabhi paatr or sampurna kathanak, prerana or shakti ke strot tathaa praasangik prathit hote hai or yahi isaki vishistataa he
 Vasudeva, despite being Krishna's father, has remained neglected in Krishna literature, neglected even in the view of the contemporary poets of Sur and Sur
 vasudev yaa to kansa ke karagaar main asahaay or vivash bandi dikhaai dete hai yaa krishna-janm ke samay putr ko surakshit gokul pahunchane hetu aakul ufanti yamuna paar karne vaale vasudev se hi ham parichit hai
 After this, Vasudev is visible only after being freed from prison after Kansa-slaughter
 isi prakaar krishna kii mata ke rup main, krishna kii bal-lilaon ke varnan main yashoda hi saamne aati he, devaki nahin
 In modern times, Hindi literature also depicts vasudev-devaki only in Pandit Dwarka Prasad Mishra's 'krishnayan' and in Maithilisharan Gupta's 'dwapar', but in the traditional form
 isi prakaar rohinee kaa charitra bhi krishna-bhakthi kavy main vatsalya kii drushti se yashoda kii chaaya maatr hi he
 He is mentioned twice in the discussion of Krishna and Balarama
 nand kaa sthaan bhi gaun hi rahaa he
 In the Dwapar of Gupta and Hariyodh's 'beloved privas', the mention of Nanda must be found
 devaki-vasudev kii katha kehete hue lekhak ne badi kushalta se krishna kii balalilaon kaa bhi chithran kiya he
 Like his earlier novels, the author has also tried to humanize many themes in this novel, contrary to prevailing assumptions, and resorted to their logical presentation
 lekin, saath hi unhone kai prasangon main ishwariya chamatkaar ko bhi sweekaar kiya he
 Devaki and Vasudeva are often depicted in various serials associated with the Mahabharata and Krishna as a helpless parent who waits for a divine miracle
 lekin, apane is upanyaas main lekhak ne vasudev-devaki ke jivan ke un sabase mushkil kshanon kaa ek bilkul hi alag chitra khinchaa he
 He presents Vasudeva as a karmayogi who opposes the injustice of Kamsa with his prodigious brilliance and prudence
 'vasudev' lekhak kii upanyaas-kala tathaa chintan style kaa sahaara paakar ek spruhaniya vyaktitv ke rup main ubhar kar aae hai
 He is an exponent of Indianness and thunder-hard as a rock in agony
 ve gambhir hai, vir hai, shastr tathaa shaastra ke gyaata hai
 Ethics are expert and are well behaved
 visham se visham paristhiti bhi unhen tod nahin paati
 He is a believer and has unwavering faith in the power of God
 swabhaav se dhairyavan hone ke saath-saath ve udghat he
 Kshatriyot Swabhimaan is filled with coddling in them
 shastreey drushti se ve dhirodatt nayak hai unhone kaha ki vasudev nitinipun hai tathaa vyavhaarik hai
 They do not think it necessary to follow the promise given to get rid of the immediate crisis, that is why they plan to save their sons from Kansa and succeed in protecting the seventh and eighth sons
 unhone kaha ki vasudev kaa vyaktitv shraddhaaspad he
 He is a formidable warrior and revered in Mathura society
 devaki bhi vasudev ke samaan hi dhairyashil, saahsee, aasthaavadi evam pratikul paristhitiyon main bhi jeevat se kaam lene vaali shaktishalini nari ke rup main drushtigochar hoti he
 At the beginning of the novel, Devaki does not look as mature as Shaktashilini or mature, but she becomes strong by meditating in the fire of circumstances
 yahaan tak ki jab pratham putr ke vadh ke baad, jahaan vasudev niraash ho jate hai, devaki sachhee ardhangini ke samaan unki shakti banati he
 When Vasudev says sinking in despair, we will not give birth to more sons
 devaki dridhtaapurvak kahati he - ham putron ko janm denge taaki hamaara aathvaan putr yathashighra is atyaachaari ko samaapt kar sake
 Here we get acquainted with the courageous, vigorous, combative personality of Devaki
 kansa ke karagaar main bhi devaki sahami hui hirani nahin varan sinhani jaisi dikhaai detii he
 Before Krishna's birth, she appears immersed in unbeatable bliss in place of fear and apprehension
 kansa is upanyaas main satta, shakti, anyaay tathaa atyaachaar kaa pratik - ek khalanaayak he
 He becomes king himself, snatching power from his father Ugrasen like Dasyu
 uski krurta, shakti or aatank ke kaaran koi bhi uskaa virodh karne kaa saahas nahin karata
 When Vasudeva's first son is born, he kills him; But he is so afraid that he does not even allow some people to accompany Vasudev for the last rites of the infant
 vah darataa he, kahin koi virodh-pradarshan yaa andolan khadaa na ho jaae
 For Kansa, Devaki's seventh womb becomes a puzzle, so Kansa, compelled and angry, puts vasudev-devaki in jail
 jab vasudev kii aathvin santan kanya hoti he, tab bhi use andeh hota he
 When he suspects Nanda's son Krishna, he makes several unsuccessful attempts to kill him
 antat: krishna-balram ko samaapt karne ke liye vah shadyantr rachataa he or unhen mathura laane hetu akrur ko bhejtaa he
 But what happens is what Magadha tantrik predicted
 devaki kii aathvin santan arthath krishna kansa kaa vadh kar dete hai
 Rohini is another strong character in this novel, who accompanies vasudev-devaki at every step
 yahaan tak ki vah devaki ke saatven garbh ko swayan apane sharir main dhaaran karti he or nandagaanv jaakar balram ko janm detii he
 She is a scholar who stays firm on the path of religion, understands the nuances of society and politics of the day
 vah nand ko mathura kii raajnneeti or kansa ke karnaamon se parichit karwaati he
 Suggesting a solution to get rid of Kansa, she tells Nanda, first of all, the consciousness of the people has to be freed from Kansa's prison
 3 upanyaas ke ant main balram ke prati uskaa adhikaar bhav tathaa moh kaa atirek, uski stri sulabh kamajori ke parichaayak hai
 Guru Gargacharya is another strong character in the novel who appears as a source of power in the novel
 ve dharm ke marm ko samajhate hai or vasudev ko hataasha or niraashaa ke kshanon main sahi maarg dikhaakar sangharsh kii prerana dete hai
 They remind Vasudev, you have an obligation to awaken the Satoguna in the society
 samaaj kii kaayarta nirantar kisi kansa kaa nirmaan karti he
 Go fight the battle of life courageously
 4 Yashoda and Krishna are presented in the traditional role
 in paatro main koi naveenta nahin he
 It is of course that Vasudev's hero is Vasudev, so Krishna is not in the lead role here, he is only helpful in accomplishing Vasudev's goal
 upanyaas main devaki-vasudev, nand yashoda, nand-rohinee, vasudev-gargacharya ke bich kai aise samvaad hai jo bharat kii vartmaan raajnneetik paristhiti or usamen vyaapt samasyaon kii drushti se atyant mahatvapurn hai
 The rohini-nanda dialogue in Chapter 24 is particularly notable: rohinee nand se kahati hai, ”praja kaa yah bhram dur karnaa he ki kansa unka raja he
 " ”raja kansa nahin he to yadavon kaa raja koun he?” nand kuch sambhram main the
 "if someone loots the subjects while living in the forest, then what is he suffering?" ”vah dasyu he
 " ”or vahi dasyu van se nikal kar rajaprasaad main aa jaae, to vah raja ho jayega kya?” rohinee ne kaha, ”isi bhram ko to mitaanaa he
 There is no king by staying in Rajprasad, sitting on the throne in Rajya Sabha and taking control of the army
 ” Narendra Kohli has written this saga in a simple manner, connecting it with the modern context, not just with the spiritual aspect
 kahani dwapar yug kii hone ke pashchaat bhi aaj kii paristhitiyon se jodi ja sakati hai
 In the novel, the events related to the birth of Shri Krishna and his supernatural acts have been taken into account with today's scientific-minded readers who hold different viewpoints towards 'mythology' and 'science Fiction'
 upanyaas ke madhyantar pashchaat lagata hi nahin ki aap koi aitahaasik katha pard rahe hai apitu lagata he aaj ke hi raajnneetik va saamaajik parivesh kaa chitra dekh rahe hai
 To make Kansa happy, the chapter on selling his soul by the intellectuals, including his ministers, seems to be the present day
 itnaa hi nahin kansa ke ek shiksha mantri ke karnaamein, naam va byoraa anayas hi pathak ke chehre par muskaan laa detaa he
 The author has tried to awaken the people of the society with full capacity who sit in their air conditioned chambers and give their opinion on the good condition of the country and consider themselves to be an act of shame
 devaki vasudev kii is gaatha kaa ek maatr or mukhya sandesh yahi hai ki raashtra kii prayek samasya kaa strot, santaap or samaadhaan raashtra ke samaaj main hi hota he or samaaj ke vasudev jaise manishiyon ke balidanon se hi desh surakshit va sabhy rah paata he
 The incarnation of incarnations like Shri Krishna is also the result of the austerity of these mystics and not a natural process
 desh va samaaj kii har samasya par shaasha va raajnneeti ko dosha na de kar swayan apana dharm nibhaana or phir us kartavyapurti pashchaat kisi puraskaar kii apeksha na karne kaa sandesh hi sambhavat: lekhak kaa nihit uddeshy he
 This novel is an invocation of another Naga Yagya and there is also an open invitation to offer sacrifices to all Indians
 unhone kaha ki vartmaan yug kansa ke yug kaa hi anuwaad he
 In this age also Vasudeva is compulsory
 jo krishna ko apane rakt main dhaaran kar saken
 Only then is the destruction of lawlessness and the protection of religion possible
 isi hetu vasudev kii rachana atyant praasangik he
 - Arvind Soral saamaajik upanyaason main jo sthaan premchand ke 'godaan' kaa he, puranic-aadhuniktaavaadi upanyaason main narendra kohli krit 'vasudev' kaa sthaan usase tanik bhi newnatar nahin he
 'vasudev' is a wonderful epic of human life, his indomitable will to fight against injustice and oppression and his sincere faith and dedication
 jahaan 'godaan' main premchand ne jarjar gramin evam shahari jivan kii saamaajik vyavastha kaa maarmik chithran kiya he, vahiin 'vasudev' main kohli ne lobh, swaarth evam traas se kshiyaman samaaj ko kushalta se na sirf ukera he balki uske kaarnon kii bhi khaasi padtaal kari he
 Premchand has put forth his philosophical ideas in 'godan' through the dialogues of Malati and Mehta, which have become sufficiently long and boring and disturb the flow of the narrative
 pathak unhen sarsari nigaah se padhakar yaa panne palat kar chhod detaa he
