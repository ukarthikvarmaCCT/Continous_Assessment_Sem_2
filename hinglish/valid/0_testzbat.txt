 It is said that no matter how deep the wound is, it heals over time, but this did not happen with the Tamils
 jin tamilon ne desh kii pragati main bhagidaari kii, unheen tamilon ko bahusankhyak singhla samudaay apana maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hua
 This is why Tamils were forced to live a life of poverty from generation to generation

 Considerable criticism has been leveled against this practice, both by Hindu organizations as opposed to state funding of private pilgrimage outside India and by Muslim pressure groups
 As an example of the latter, Mohib Ahmad contends that even Air India's subsidized fare is higher than competing airlines' ordinary fare
 However, the government has continued offering the Haj subsidy despite protests from the Muslim community at large
 Syed Shahabuddin claims that Air India's rising costs for travel, and the consequent increases in the Government of India's subsidy, has resulted from differences in foreign exchange rates beyond the airline's control
 He suggests charter fares should be set at two-thirds of regular IATA fares, but points out that the Haj has higher costs than other charters because two empty flights are required to return the aircraft to India and to position the aircraft in Arabia for the pilgrims' return journey
 Shahabuddin maintains that the subsidy ought to be phased out because Hindus view the subsidy as preferential treatment of India's Muslim minority
 Other Muslim leaders have argued that the Hajj subsidy is "un-islamic" and that Hajj money should be invested in education and health instead
 moulana mahmud madani, a member of the rajya sabha and general secretary of the jamiat-e-ulema-e-hind, declared that the Hajj subsidy is a technical violation of Islamic sharia, since the quran declares that Hajj should be performed by Muslims using their own resources
 Influential Muslim lobbies in India have regularly insisted that the Hajj subsidy should be phased out as it is unislamic
 Likewise, Hindu groups argue that a government sponsored Hajj subsidy forcibly taxes Hindus to pay for Muslim religious pilgrimages, and tantamounts to appeasement of Islam
 After considerable pressure from Muslim groups and the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Congress government in 2010 decided to begin phasing out the Haj subsidy that had been in operation since 1993
 The Central Haj Committee of India will work through the Ministry of External Affairs to restructure the air fares so that the richer Hajis will pay a premium for the poorer pilgirms
 The entire restructuring is expected to take about seven years and be completed by 2017
 In August 2010, the Minority Affairs Ministry formally opposed providing subsidy for Haj pilgrimage, saying the scheme — in operation since 1993— was contrary to the teachings of Islam
 The Government of India has proposed that starting from 2011, the amount of government subsidy per person will be decreased, and by 2017 will be ended completely

 After the defeat of the King of Warangal at the hands of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, Bukk and his brother were taken captive and sent to Delhi

 War and peace, the death of Anna Karenina and Ivan Ilyich as the most poignant portrayals of death , have been the basis of the above incident
 yatra se lautakar unhone apane gaanv yasnaya polyana main krishakon ke bacchon ke liye ek skool kholaa
 The education system of this school was very progressive
 isamen vartmaan parikshapranali evam iske aadhaar par uteern anuteern kaarne kii vyavastha nahin rakhi gai thi
 The school was a big success mainly due to Tolstoy's leadership power and heartfelt passion towards him
 vidhyalay kii ore se, gaanv ke hi naam par ""yasnaya polyana"" naamak ek patrika bhi nikalati thi jisamen prakashit tollstoy ke lekhon main vidhyalay ore uske chaatro kii vibhinn samasyaon par bade hi sargarbhit vichaar vyakt hue hai
 In 1862, Tolstoy was married to a high-ranking elite woman named Safia Berhus
 unke vaivaahik jivan kaa purvaash to bada sukhad rahaa par uttaransh katutapurna beetaa
 In Tolstoy's married life, the ideal of a housewife was completely similar to that of an Indian housewife: but the views of the then Russian elite society were quite different
 1863 se 1869 tak tollstoy kaa samay "waar and pis" kii rachana main evam 1873 se 76 tak kaa samay "anna karenina" kii rachana main beetaa
 Both these compositions greatly elevated Tolstoy's literary fame
 ve manushyajivan kaa rahasy or uske tatvachintan ke prati vishesh jaagruk the
 The period from 1875 to 1879 was very disappointing for him - he had lost his faith in God and had taken off on committing suicide
 par ant main unhone isapar vijay pai
 In 1878–79, he composed his controversial work called "confession"
 iske krantikari vichaar aise hai jinke kaaran rus main iske prakaashan kii anumati bhi nahin mili or pustak switsraland main prakashit hui
 Many of his other compositions of this time are of this category and they are all printed in Switzerland
 1878 se lekar 1885 tak kii avadhi main falaatmak sahitya srijan kii drushti se tollstoy niskriy rahe
 His intuition remained entangled in the search for the secret of human life
 ambtak kii samast rachanaayen unhen vyarth prathit hone lageen
 But in 1886, he again appeared as a high-profile well-known writer and in the same year published his great novel work "the Death of Ivan Ilyich"
 unke aachaar sambandhi vishwaason ke prati ab sara sansar aakrishth ho chukaa tha or yasnaya polyana gram kii manyata utkrisht tirthasthali ke rup main jagaddhikhyath ho chuki thi
 Our Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi was a young man at this time
 inhen dinon unhone tollstoy kii rachanaayen ruchipurvak padhi thim or unki ore aakrisht hue the
 Towards the end of the 19th century, Tolstoy's service to the poor and helpless grew to such an extent that he donated all his income from his creations to Russia
 apni patni ko maatr utana ansh lene kii unhone anumati di jitna parivaar ke bhar poshan ke liye anivaary tha
 He gave all the proceeds of his novel called 'resurgence' to the Russian pacifist caste Dukhbor people to abandon Russia and settle in Canada
 1910 main sahasaa unhone apane paitrik gram "yasnaya polyana" ko sarvada ke liye parityakt karne kaa nishchay kiya
 He departed with his daughter Alexandra on 10 November 1910, but on 22 November 1910, he accidentally died in a lung in the passage station Estapovo
 unki dharmabhavana badi udaar or vyapak thi
 He had a clear antagonism towards the then Christianity
 apane vichaaron se ve ek prakaar ke sarvadevvaadi prathit hote hai
 He considered death as the inevitable end of the body
 manushya ko ve sharir kii antim or avashyambhavi parinti maanate the
 He considered it appropriate to assess everything that came in contact with human beings from the criteria of utility and for this reason he always remained curious about the purpose of life
 niruddeshy, vichaarheen ore aatmakendrit jivan ko ve ek prakaar kaa paap maanate the; yahan tak ki sambhog ko ve keval santanotpatti ke uddeshy se hi vihit maanate the
 In psychological works, Fyodor Dostoyevsky equates Tolstoy
 galswardi, tamas maan, juls romyna aadi mahaan lekhakon par tollstoy kaa ullekhneey prabhaav padaa he
 Later Russian writers have also been strongly influenced by Tolstoy
 lenin sahit vishwa ke anekanek vidwaanon ne tolastoy ke sahitya, visheshtah 'yuddh or shaanti' kii sarvshereshthata muktakanth se sweekaar kii he; parantu tolastoy ek vichaarak bhi the or saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath-saath nibandhon tathaa anya vidhaon main bhi unhone apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii he
 Regarding the usefulness of his age-old reference ideas, Lenin believes that "tolstoy has created such fine literature that will always be valuable and readable to the public, when he overturns the zamindars and the capitalists and arranges a social life for himself Will do it
 saath hi tolastoy ullekhneey oj ke saath vartmaan vyavastha main paddalit aam janata kii manodasha ko vyakt karne tathaa uski dasha kaa varnan karne tathaa uske virodh evam rosh ke swatahsfoort bhaavon ko mukherit karne main samarth hue hai
 Tolstoy mainly belonged to the era from 1861 to 1904 and has - as an artist, thinker and preacher - highlighted in his works the historical peculiarities of the First Russian Revolution, its capabilities and flaws with surprising clarity
 " Despite this, in the context of the various flaws of the ancient system, the internal vacuity of the rich class and the views of Tolstoy appearing against him, Lenin states that "there was nothing new in Tolstoy's criticism
" unhone koi aisi baat nahin kahi jo unase bahut arase pehle europea tathaa roosi sahitya main mehanatakashon ke himytiyon dwaara na kahi gayi ho
 The characteristic and historical significance of Tolstoy's criticism is that the radical change in the attitude of the mass people of Russia - the pastoral, peasants of our period - is expressed in such a way, Which was just the work of a talented artist
 " Lenin understood Tolstoy's literary significance very well and therefore he has praised him heavily; But at the same time he also understood the imperative of being aware of many harmful aspects of his ideas in the era
 isliye disambar 1910 main unhone spashtatya yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastoy kii saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa adhyayan karke roosi majdoor varg apane dushmano ko zyada acchhee tarah pahchaan sakegaa
 By studying his principles, the entire Russian public will know what his personal weakness, which prevented him from fulfilling his goal of independence, was contained
 aage badhane ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he
 All those who are obstructing this progress, declare Tolastoy as 'the conscience of all of us', 'life-teacher'
 yah vah jhooth he jise udaarataavaadi jo tolastoy ke siddhanton ke kranti-virdohi pahalu kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, jaanboojhkar failaa rahe hai
 Tolstoy's lie of being a 'life-teacher' is seen by some former social-democrats who are seen by liberals
 roosi janata aazaadee tabhi praapt karegi, jab vah samaj legi ki use behatar jivan ke liye sangharsh karne kii shiksha tolastoy se nahin, balki us varg se leni he, jiskaa mahatv tolastoy nahin samaj paye or jo us puraani duniya ko, jisase tolastoy ghrinaa karte the, ukhaad phenkane main samarth ekmaatr varg he -- arthath sarvhaara varg se
 Lenin again elaborated on 22 January 1911, citing some of Tolstoy's narrative works, as well as several non-fiction works, expressing the view that despite being a reactionary and utopian element in Tolstoyism, some circles of the public 25 years ago For perhaps, critical elements of Tolstoy's theories could have had practical utility
 par ab, udhaahrantah pichley dashak main, aisi baat nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki pichhali shatabdi ke nauven dashak se lekar shatabdi ke ant tak aitihaasik vikaas bahut aage bad gaya he
 So today, when the above events have put an end to the 'eastern' stagnation, today, when the consciously reactionary, narrow-class and selfish-class meanings of 'vakhi' cults spread so widely among the liberal bourgeoisie Gone, today, when some of the Marxists, who are showing the contagion of these ideas, have also felt that the result is the 'immersionist' tendency, then respect the principles of Tolastoy To justify or smuggle their 'disrespect', their 'soul' woes, their call for 'self-realization', the principle of 'conscience' and world 'love', their teachings of austerity and Quietism, etc
 Every effort to do it is the direct and deepest loss

 The process through which tropical cyclogenesis occurs is different from the decrease in mid-latitude cyclogenesis
 ushnkaribandheey chakravaati ansh, ek garam-sat chakravaat ko viksit karne main sahaayak hota he jo anukool mahatvapurn vaataavaran ke kaaran banataa he
 The six main requirements of tropical cyclogenesis are: sufficiently warm sea surface temperature, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the low to mid-level troposphere, the required Coriolis force, a pre-existent low level or shallow and low vertical shear wind
 Around the world, on average 86 annual tropical storms turn into tropical storms
 in main se 47 tufaan / taqatvar aandhi ban jate hai or 20 gahan ushnkaribandheey chakravaat banate he
 Mesocyclones are formed when the speed of the wind shifts with rapid changes and / or highs, setting a fraction by moving in a drain circle at the bottom of the atmosphere

 Polar low is also referred to by other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, arctic storm, arctic low and cold air pressure
 Usually the term is reserved for more vigorous systems where at least 17 m is near - Surface winds
 1 An extratropical tropical cyclone is an abbreviated scale low-pressure weather system that has neither tropical nor any polar features, associated with a forward and parallel gradient in temperature and snow point, thus called a "baroclinic zone"
 is
 'attirikt ushnkaribandheey' shabd is tathy kaa nirupan karte he ki is prakaar ke chakravaat grah ke katibandhon ke baahar, madhya akshanshon ke bich hote hai
 These systems are reported as 'mid latitude cyclones' due to their regional formation or post-tropical cyclones, where extra-tropical transition occurs and is often 'low' or 'low' by earlier weather forecasters and the general public
 Pressure 'is described
 ye har rose kii ghatnaayen hai, jo virdohi chakravaaton ke saath, dharti ke adhiktar hisse ke mausam ko banaati hai
 However, extra-tropical cyclones are almost always called baroclinic, as they remain with the western air temperature and snowflake regions and sometimes become barotropic when the temperature distribution near the cyclone is uniform with radius

 An intramuscular cyclone is a weather system with some characteristics of tropical cyclones and some additional tropical cyclones
 ye bumadhya rekha or 50 wein samanaantar ke bich ban sakate hai
 Since the 1950s, astronomers did not understand whether to call it a tropical cyclone or a more tropical cyclone
 That is why they were called tropical equatorial and semi-tropical, which were also called hybrid cyclones, until 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this cyclone class
 antah ushn katibandheey chakravaaton ko 2002 se atlantic basin se sarkari ushnkaribandheey chakravaat suchi se naam praapt hone lage
 They have a broad wind pattern, which can hold maximum air that is located farther from the center than tropical cyclones, and is found at temperatures ranging from weak to mid-level
 kyonki ye adhik katibandhon vaale chakravaaton se banate hai, jinka taapmaana anya kati bandhon se thanda hota he, unke gathan ke liye prayukt samudr ke sataha kaa taapmaana ushnkaribandheey chakravaat dahalij kii tulana main teen degree celsius, yaa paanch degree pheranheit se kam hota he jo, 23 degree celsius ke aasapaas hota hai
 This suggests that intertropical cyclones form outside the conventional boundary in stormy weather

 a tropical cyclone is a storm system, which is a low pressure center and produces thunderstorms, strong winds and high rainfall
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat, tab banataa he jab nam hawa se garmi nikalati he, jiske parinamswaroop nam hawa main nihit bashp jari ho jaataa he
 These are formed by different heat components and are called other cyclonic storms, such as nor'easters, European windstorms, polar less, storm systems
 yah shabd 'ushnkaribandheey' donon bhugolic roopon ko suchit karata he, jo anany rup se globe ke ushnkaribandheey kshetron main paye jate he or samudri hawa, ushnkaribandheey hawa samoohon main banati he
 The term 'cyclone' refers to a cyclonic cyclone by nature, which rotates in the northern hemisphere, in the Uttaravarat and in the southern hemisphere
 sthaan or shakti ke aadhaar par ushnkaribandheey chakravaato ko anya naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he, jaise tufaan, aandhi, ushnkaribandheey tufaan, chakravaati toofaan, ushnkaribandheey dabaav, yaa keval chakravaat
}saamanyatya, ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ko atlantic basin or prashanth mahaasaagar main tufaan kaha jaataa he
 Although tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rains, they are also capable of producing high waves and destructive storms
 ve garm pani ke bade nikaayon par viksit hoti he or jameen ke uppar hilne se unki takat kam ho jati he
 For this reason, tropical storms can cause considerable damage to coastal areas, while inland areas are relatively safe from them

 ve katibandhon se garmi or urja ko uthaakar shitoshna akshansh kii ore le jaataa he, jiske kaaran ye vaishvik vaataavaran parisancharan tantra kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa ban jate he
 As a result, tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth's atmosphere, keeping temperatures around the world relatively stable and warm
 kai ushnkaribandheey chakravaat us samay viksit hote hai jab vaataavaran main ek kamjor uthal-puthal ke saath vaataavaran kii sthiti anukool hoti he
 Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics

 At the other end of the spectrum, if conditions around the system deteriorate or tropical cyclones make landfall, the system weakens and eventually collapses
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat attirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaat tab ban jaataa he jab vah ucch akshansh kii ore badhata he agar isaki urja kaa mul sankshepan dwaara jari kii gai ho to vah garmi se badal kar hawa raashiyon ke bich vaataavaran main badal jaataa he; ek kriyasheel drushti se kaha ja saktaa he ki, ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat apane atirikt sankraman ke dauraan ant: ushnkaribandheey nahin banataa

 ayurvigyaan, vigyaan kii vah shakha he jiskaa sambandh maanav sharir ko nirog rakhane, rog ho jane par rog se mukt karne athwa uskaa shaman karne tathaa aayu badhaane se he
 It is that branch of medical science, which is concerned with keeping the human body healthy, freeing or diagnosing the disease in case of disease, and increasing age
 bharat ayurvigyaan kaa janmdata he
 In its early times, medicine was studied in the same way as a branch of biology
 baad main 'sharir rachana' tathaa 'sharir kriya vigyaan' aadi ko iskaa aadhaar banaaya gaya
 The birth of medicine in India was several thousand years BC
 It was initially studied as a branch of biology, and anatomy and physiology were made the basis of it
 sharir main honevaali kriyaaon ke gyaan se pataa laga ki unka rup bahut kuch rasinic he or ye ghatnaayen raasaanik kriyaaon ke fal hai
 As soon as the discovery took place, the chemical form of the events of the body came out
 is prakaar rasayan vigyaan kaa itnaa mahatv badha ki vah ayurvigyaan kii ek pruthak shakha ban gaya, jiskaa naam jeevarsayan rakhaa gaya
 By this, not only the form of physical events became clear, but also the origin of diseases and methods of resistance came out
 saath hi bhautik vigyaan ne bhi shaareerik ghatnaon ko bhalee bhanti samajhane main bahut sahaayta di
 It is known that many events happen according to physical rules
 ab jeevarsayan kii bhanti jeevbhautikee bhi ayurvigyaan kaa ek ang ban gai he or usase bhi rogon kii utpatti ko samajhane main tathaa unka pratirodh karne main bahut sahaayta mili he
 Other branches of science have also helped a lot in disease prevention and medicine
 or in sabake sahyog se manushya ke kalyaan main bahut pragati hui he, jiske falswaroop jeevankaal bad gaya he
 Many kinds of experimental methods and instruments, which have been made from time to time, have been very helpful in acquiring a subtle knowledge of the body, physical phenomena and internal functions related to the disease
 kintu is gahan adhyayan kaa fal yah hua ki ayurvigyaan anek shakhaon main vibhakt ho gaya or prayek shakha main itani khoj hui he, naveen upkaran bane hai tathaa praayogic vidhiyaan gyaat kii gai hai ki koi bhi vidvan yaa vidhyaarthee un sab se purnataya parichit nahin ho saktaa
 Day by day, the doctor has to depend on laboratories and equipment and this dependency is increasing progressively
 prayek shiksha kaa dhyey manushya kaa maansik vikaas hota he, jisase usamen tark karke samajhane or tadnusaar apane bhaavon ko prakat karne tathaa karyanvit karne kii shakti utpann ho jaay
 This is also the aim of medical education
 iske liye sab ayurvigyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon main vidhyaarthee ko upasnaatak ke rup main paanch varsh bitaane padate hai
 In medical colleges, students are admitted on the basis of studying the basic sciences and getting higher secondary education
 tatpashchaat pratham do varsh vidhyaarthee sharirarachana tathaa sharirkriya naamak aadharvigyaanon kaa adhyayan karata he jisase usko sharir kii swaabhaavik dasha kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 After this, three years are spent in getting knowledge of the deformities of these natural conditions due to diseases and in learning the methods of their treatment
 rogon ko rokane ke upaay tathaa bheshajavaidhik kaa bhi, jo is vigyaan kii niti sambandhi shakha he, vah isi kaal main adhyayan karata he
 After these five years of study, he becomes a graduate
 iske pashchaat vah ek varsh tak apni ruchi ke anusaar kisi vibhaag main kaam karata he or us vishay kaa kriyaatmak gyaan praapt karata he
 Thereafter, he can join a department to get a diploma or degree in postgraduate teaching
 sab ayurvigyaan mahavidhyalay kisi na kisi vishvavidhyalay se sambandhit hote hai jo unki parikshaon tathaa shikshankram kaa sanchaalan karata he or jiskaa uddeshy vigyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon main tark kii shakti utpann karnaa or vigyaan ke nae rahasyon kaa udghaatan karnaa hota he
 The aim of every teacher and student of medical schools should also be that he should try to advance the art of this antidote by searching for new anti-inflammatory items
 itnaa hi nahin, shikshakon kaa jeevanalakshya yah bhi hona chahie ki vah aise anveshak utpann karen
 The centerpiece of medical practice is the general practitioner who keeps in close contact with the public or families and helps them when needed
 vah apane rogiyon kaa mitra tathaa paramarshdaata hota he or samay par unhen darshanik santvanaa dene kaa praytn karata he
 He is familiar with simple problems related to the disease and goes to distant places, villages, etc
 and serves the patients
 yahan usko sahaayta ke ve sab upkaran nahin praapt hote jo usne shikshan kaal main dekhe the or jinka prayog usne siikhaa tha
 These become available in large cities
 aavashyaktaa padane par usko visheshgy se sahaayta leni padati he yaa rogi ko aspataal main bhejnaa hota he
 Nowadays, some doctors become experts after studying a particular branch of this science
 is prakaar hridayrog, maansik rog, asthirog, ballrog aadi main visheshgyon dwaara vishisht chikitsa uplabdh he
 Nowadays medical expenses have increased a lot
 rog ke nidaan ke liye aavashyak parikshaayen, moolyavaan aushadhiyaan, chikitsa kii vidhiyaan or upkaran iske mukhya kaaran hai
 The life of the public has also increased due to modern medicine, but there is a lot of expenditure on medicines
 khed he ki vartmaan aarthik dashaon ke kaaran uchit upachaar saadhaaran manushya kii samathrya ke baahar ho gaya he
 The power of medical science is now greatly increased and is continuously increasing

 pidaa kaa shaman, bahut kaal tak murchhavastha main rakhana, anek sankramak rogon kii safal chikitsa, sahaj pravritiyon kaa daman or vruddhi, aushadhiyon dwaara bhaavon kaa parivartan, shalyakriya dwaara vyaktitv par prabhaav aadi sab sambhav ho gaye hai
 Man's lifetime is longer

 The government has three major health related functions

 The physician has a great place and responsibility in accomplishing these three objectives
