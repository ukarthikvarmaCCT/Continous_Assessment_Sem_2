 2280 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 2280 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar

 The screaming chalice is a powerful westerly wind moving between latitudes of 40 and 50 degrees south of the Earth's southern hemisphere
 pashchim-se-purv chalane vaale yah vaayu pravaah bumadhya rekha se vaayu dakshini dhruv kii ore jane se or prithvi ke ghurnan se banate hai
 There is very little land between latitudes 40 and 50 degrees south of the Earth and for the most part there is only the open ocean from which the hills or other topographies that prevent these winds are absent and their strength increases
 chinati chaalis hawaaon se yahan kii lahare bhi kabhi-kabhi tej vaayu pravaah se uttejit hokar bhayankar oonchaai pakad leti hai
 In spite of these waves, boats from Europe to Australia prior to the era of mechanization used to take advantage of their sails coming south from 40 degrees further south to catch up to speed east

 This is a bicameral system
 bhartiya sansad main raashtrapati tathaa do sadan- loksabhaa evam rajyasabha hote hai
 The President has the power to summon or adjourn either House of Parliament or dissolve the Lok Sabha
 bhartiya sansad kaa sanchaalan 'sansad bhawan' main hota he
 Which is located in New Delhi
 lok sabha main raashtra kii janata dwaara chune hue pratinidhi hote hai jinaki adhiktam sankhya 552 he
 Rajya Sabha is a permanent house with 250 members
 rajya sabha ke sadasyon kaa nirvachan / manonayan 6 varsh ke liye hota he
 1 / 3 of whose members retire every 2 years
 vartmaan me loksabhaa ke sadasyo kii sankhya 545 he tathaa rajyasabha ke sadasyo kii sankhya 245 he
 India's political system, or the way a government is formed and run, is called parliamentary democracy
 gram-panchayatein hamaare jan-jivan kaa abhinn ang rahi he
 In olden times, panchayats of villages were formed by elections
 use nyaay or vyavastha, donon hi kshetron main khub adhikaar mili hue the
 Members of the panchayats had great respect in the court
 yahi panchayatein bhoomi kaa bantwaaraa karti thim
 Used to collect taxes
 gaanv kii ore se sarkaar kar kaa hissaa detii thim
 Somewhere there was a large panchayat above many gram-panchayats
 yah un par nigaraanee or niyantran rakhti thi
 Some earlier inscriptions also reveal how members of gram-panchayats were elected
 sadsy banane ke liye jaruri gunon or chunaavon main mahilaon kii bhagidaari ke niyam bhi is par likhe the
 Any member could be removed from the post for not doing good conduct or not being able to properly account for state money
 padon par kisi bhi sadsy kaa koi nikat-sambandhi niyukt nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Institutions such as the Parliament House and the Committee disappeared in the Middle Ages
 upar ke str par loktantratmak sansthaaon kaa vikaas ruuk gaya
 For hundreds of years we were involved in mutual battles
 videshiyon ke akraman par akraman hote rahe
 The armies kept losing and winning
 shaasha badalte rahe
 We also remained under slavery of foreign rule
 sindh se assam tak or kashmir se kanyakumari tak, panchayat sansthaaen baraabar chalati raheen
 These regional district councils were called by different names like Municipal Council, Paur Sabha, Gram Sabha, Gram Sangha
 sach main ye panchayatein hi gaanvon kii ‘sansad’ thim
 The Charter Act of 1883 saw the seeds of a Legislative Council for the first time
 1853 ke antim charter adhinium ke dwaara vidhaayi parshad shabdon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 This new council began to take the form of a gathering investigating complaints and trying to address them
 1857 kii aazaadee ke liye pehali ladaai ke baad 1861 kaa bhartiya concil adhinium bana
 The Act was called the 'chief Manifesto of the Indian Legislature'
 jiske dwaara ‘bharat main vidhaayi adhikaron ke antaran kii pranali’ kaa udghaatan hua
 This Act made significant changes in the system of legislation at the Central and Provincial levels
 angreji raaj ke bharat main jamane ke baad pehali baar vidhaayi nikaayon main gaiyr-sarkari logon ke rakhane kii baat ko mana gaya
 From the decades of 1860s and 1870s, political consciousness began to develop in Indians
 1870 ke ant main 1880 ke dashak ke shuru main bhartiya janamanas raajnneetik rup se kaaphi jaagruk ho chukaa tha
 In 1885, this political consciousness changed its course
 bhartiya raajnneetik or raajnneeti main sakriy buddhijivi, rashtriya hiton ke liye rashtriya str par sangharsh karne ke liye ek sanghathan kii jarurat mahasoos kiye
 In this series, AOHUM established the Indian National Congress in 1885 to improve the council
 british sansad ne ‘vidhaan parishadon main bharat kii janata ko vastav main pratinidhitiv dene’ ke liye indian kaunsilz adhinium 1892 ko sweekaar kiya
 In 1919, the Reform Act and several rules were made thereunder
 jinke kaaran centre main, bhartiya vidhaan parishad ke sthaan par dwisadaneey vidhanmandal banaaya gaya
 One was the State Council and the other was the Legislative Assembly
 prayek sadan main adhikansh sadasyon kaa chunaav hota tha
 The first Legislative Assembly was formed in the year 1921
 uske kul 145 sadsy the
 104 elected, 26 government members and 15 nominated non-government members
 1923 main, deshbandhu chitaranjan das or pandit motilal nehru ne swaraj party banaai
 They thought that by entering into the 'enemy's camp', a place should be made in the councils to break the system
 iske liye chunaav main bhaag liya gaya
 The Swaraj Party had much success in the elections of 1923
 swaraj party ne 145 sthanon main se 45 sthaan jite
 The party was in the Central Legislature
 kendriya vidhaan sabha ke nae chunaav main congress 1942 ke ‘bharat chodo’ prastaav ko lekar ladaa
 Congress got 56 seats out of 102 in the elections
 congress vidhayak dal ke netaa sharat chandra bose the
 There were some changes under the Indian Independence Act 1947
 1935 ke adhinium ke ve upbandh kaam ke nahin rah gaye jinke tahat governor-general yaa governor apane vivekadhikaar ke anusaar athwa apane vyaktigat vichaar ke anusaar kaary kar saktaa tha
 In the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the Constituent Assembly of India was declared a full sovereign body
 14-15 agast 1947 kii madhya raatri ko us sabha ne desh kaa shashan chalaane kii purna shaktiyaan grahan kar leen
 The Constituent Assembly gained full legislative power through Section 8 of the Act
 kintu saath hi yah anubhav kiya gaya ki samvidhan sabha ke samvidhan-nirmaan ke kaary tathaa vidhanmandal ke rup main iske saadhaaran kaary main bhed banaae rakhana jaruri hoga
 The first meeting of the Constituent Assembly as a separate body was held on 17 November 1947
 iske adhyaksh sabha ke pradhan dow rajendra prasad the
 Only Mr
 G
V
 for the post of Constitution President
 Mavalankar received the same name
 isliye unhen vidhivat chunaa hua ghoshit kiya gaya
 On 14 November 1948, BR Ambedkar, the chairman of the drafting committee, presented the draft of the constitution
 prastaav ke paksh main bahumat tha
 The Constitution of the Republic of Independent India came into force on 26 January 1950
 iske kaaran aadhunik sansthagat dhaanche or uski anya sab shakha-prashakhaon sahit purna sansadeey pranali sthapit ho gai
 The Constituent Assembly became the Provisional Parliament of India
 vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par pehle aam chunaavon ke baad nae samvidhan ke upbandhon ke anusaar sansad kaa gathan hone tak isi prakaar kaary karti rahi
 The first general elections under the new constitution were held in the year 1951–52
 pehali chuni hui sansad jiske do sadan the, rajyasabha or loksabhaa may, 1952 main bani; duusari lok sabha may 1957 main bani; teesri april 1962 main; chauthi march 1967 main; paanchavi maach 1971 main; 6 march 1977 main; saatvin janvari 1980 main; 8 janvari 1985 main; naveen disambar 1989 main, dasvin june 1991 or gyarahavin 1996 main bani
 The Rajya Sabha, formed for the first time in 1952, is a continuous, permanent house
 jiskaa kabhi vighatan nahin hota
 One-third of its members retire every two years
 bhartiya loktantr main sansad janata kii sarvocch pratinidhi sanstha he
 It is through this that the sovereignty of the common people gets expression
 sansad hi is baat kaa pramaan he ki hamaari raajnneetik vyavastha main janata sabase upar he, janamat sarvopari he
 The word 'parliamentary' itself means such a democratic political system where the supreme power is vested in that body of people's representatives, which is called 'parliament'
 bharat ke samvidhan ke adheen sangheey vidhanmandal ko ‘sansad’ kaha jaataa he
 It is the axis which is the foundation of the governance of the country
 bhartiya sansad raashtrapati or do sadanon—rajyasabha or loksabhaa—se milakar banati he
 Although the President of India is a part of the Parliament, yet he neither sits in either of the two houses nor participates in its discussions
 raashtrapati samay samay par sansad ke donon sadanon ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karata he
 a Bill passed by both the Houses can become law only if the President gives his approval to it
 itnaa hi nahin, jab sansad ke donon sadanon kaa adhiveshan na chal rahaa ho or raashtrapati ko mahasoos ho ki in paristhitiyon main turant kaarywahi jaruri he to vah adhyadesh jari kar saktaa he
 The power and effect of this ordinance is the same as the law passed by Parliament
 loksabhaa ke liye prayek aam chunaav ke pashchaat adhiveshan ke shuru main or har saal ke pehle adhiveshan ke prarambh main raashtrapati ek saath sansad ke donon sadanon ke saamne abhibhaashan karata he
 He informs the Parliament of the reasons for calling the meeting of the Houses
 iske alaava vah sansad ke kisi ek sadan athwa ek saath donon ke samaksh abhibhaashan kar saktaa he
 For this he can expect the presence of members
 use sansad main us samay lambit kisi vidheyak ke sambandh main sandesh yaa koi anya sandesh kisi bhi sadan ko bhejne kaa adhikaar he
 The House to which a message has been sent in this way quickly considers the subject written in that message as convenient
 kuch prakaar ke vidheyak raashtrapati kii sifarish praapt karne ke baad hi pesh kiye ja sakate hai athwa un par aage koi kaarywahi kii ja sakati he
 As its name suggests, the Rajya Sabha is the Council of States
 yah apratyaksh reeti se logon kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 The member of the Rajya Sabha is elected by the elected legislators of the state legislatures
 prayek rajya ke pratinidhiyon kii sankhya zyaadaatar uski jansankhya par nirbhar karti he
 Thus, Chhattisgarh has 5 members in Rajya Sabha, Uttar Pradesh has 31 members in Rajya Sabha
 manipur, mizoram, sikkim, tripura aadi chote rajyon ke keval ek ek sadsy hai
 The Rajya Sabha can have up to 250 members
 inamen raashtrapati dwaara manonith 12 sadsy tathaa 238 rajyon or sangh-rajya kshetron dwaara chune sadsy hote hai
 The Rajya Sabha currently has 245 members
 rajyasabha ke prayek sadsy kii karyavadhi chah varsh he
 The Vice President is elected by the members of both houses of Parliament
 vah rajyasabha kaa paden sabhapati hota he
 The members of the Rajya Sabha elect one of their own for the post of Deputy Chairman
 lok sabha ke sadasyon kaa chunaav janata dwaara sidhe vot daalkar kiya jaataa he
 Every Indian citizen of the age of 18 years and above will be entitled to vote
 lok sabha ke adhiktam 530 sadsy rajyon se chunaav kshetron kii pratyaksh reeti se chune jaaenge
 a maximum of 20 members will represent the Union Territories
 iske atirikt, raashtrapati angl-bhartiya samudaay kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye do se andhik sadsy manonith kar saktaa he
 Thus the maximum number of members of the House is 552, it is envisaged in the Constitution
 lok sabha main anusuchit jatiyon tathaa anusuchit janajatiyon ke liye jansankhya-anupaat ke aadhaar par sthaan arakshit he
 Initially this reservation was for ten years
 naveenatam sanshodhan ke antargat ab yah pachaas varsh ke liye arthath san 2000 tak ke liye hai
 The term of the house in India is five years
 paanch varshon kii avadhi samaapt ho jane par sadan khud bhang ho jaataa he
 In some circumstances, Parliament can be dissolved before the full term ends
 apatkaal kii sthati main sansad lok sabha kii karyavadhi badha sakati he
 It cannot exceed one year at a time
 sansad ke donon sadanon ko, kuch maamalon ko chhodkar sabhi kshetron main samaan shaktiyaan evam darja praapt he
 Before any non-financial bill is enacted, it is required to be passed by each of the two houses
 raashtrapati par mahabhiyog chalaane, uparashtrapati ko hataane, samvidhan main sanshodhan karne or ucchtam nyaayalay evam ucch nyaayalayon ke nyaayadhishon ko hataane jaise mahatvapurn maamalon main rajyasabha ko lok sabha ke samaan shaktiyaan praapt he
 It is mandatory to place the President's Ordinances, Proclamation of Emergency and Proclamation of the failure of the constitutional system in a State and the failure of the Constitutional system in a State before both the Houses of Parliament
 kisi dhan vidheyak or samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ko chhodkar anya kisi bhi vidheyak par donon sadanon ke bich asahmati ko donon sadanon dwaara sanyukt baithak main dur kiya jaataa he
 Matters are decided by majority in this meeting
 donon sadanon kii aisi baithak kaa peethasin adhikari loksabhaa kaa adhyaksh hota he
 In India, both the Prime Minister and the Minister can be a member of either of the houses
 kisi aise vyakti ko bhi pradhanmantri yaa mantri niyukt kiya ja saktaa he jo sansad ke kisi bhi sadan kaa sadsy na ho, parantu use chah maas ke pashchaat pad chhodana padataa he, yadi is bich, vah donon main se kisi sadan ke liye nirvaachit na ho jaae
 The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha
 ant: uske liye yah jaruri he ki lok sabha kaa vishwaas khote hi pad-tyaag kar den
 Parliamentary rule should mean rule by Parliament
 kintu sansad swayan shashan nahin karti or na hi kar sakati he
 In a way it can be said about the Council of Ministers that it is the great executive committee of Parliament
 jise mul nikaay kii ore se shashan karne kaa uttardaayitv saunpa jaataa he
 The function of Parliament is to legislate, advise, criticize and express the grievances of the people
 karypalika kaa kaary shashan karnaa he, yadhyapi vah sansad kii ore se hi shashan karti he
 In a large and heavily populated country like India, conducting elections is a huge task
 sansad ke donon sadanon- loksabhaa or rajyasabha- ke liye chunaav berokatoke or nishpaksh hon, iske liye ek swatantra chunaav ayog banaaya gaya he
 General elections to the Lok Sabha are held when the term is over or dissolved
 bharat kaa prayek naagarik jo 18 varsh kaa yaa usase adhik ho matdaan kaa adhikari he
 The minimum age for contesting Lok Sabha elections is 25 years and for Rajya Sabha 30 years
 rajyasabha ke sadsy rajyon ke logon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 They are elected by the elected members of the state legislative assembly
 rajyasabha main sthaan bharne ke liye raashtrapati, chunaav ayog dwaara sujhai gai taarikh ko, adhisuchana jari karata he
 Such notification is not issued more than three months before the date on which the retiring members expire
 chunaav adhikari, chunaav ayog ke anumodan se matdaan kaa sthaan nirdhaarit or adhishuchet karata he
 For the election of the new Lok Sabha, the President, by notification published in the Gazette, asks all the parliamentary constituencies to elect members on the date suggested by the Election Commission
 adhisuchana jari kiye jane ke pashchaat chunaav ayog namakan patr daayar karne, unki chaanbin karne, unhen waapas lene or matdaan ke liye tithiyaan nirdhaarit karata he
 Due to direct election to the Lok Sabha, the territory of India is divided into suitable territorial constituencies
 prayek sansadeey nirvachan kshetra se ek sadsy ko chunaa jaataa he
 If a member of one House is also elected to the other House, then his / her position in the first House is vacated from the date when he / she is elected to the other House
 isi prakaar, yadi vah kisi rajya vidhanmandal ke sadsy ke rup main bhi chun liya jaataa he to, yadi vah rajya vidhanmandal main apane sthaan se, rajya ke rajptr main ghoshnaa ke prakaashan se 14 dinon ke bheetar, tyaagptr nahin de detaa to, sansad kaa sadsy nahin rahata
 If a member does not attend a meeting of the House for a period of 60 days without the permission of the House, then that House can declare its place vacant
 iske alaava, kisi sadsy ko sadan main apana sthaan rikt karnaa padataa he yadi If a member is disqualified on the basis of change in terms of the provisions of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, his membership may be terminated
 sansad ke yaa kisi rajya vidhanmandal ke kisi sadan ke liye hue kisi chunaav ko chunauti ucch-nyaayalay main di ja sakati he
 The petition can be moved during the election due to adopting a corrupt process
 yadi siddh ho jaae to ucch nyaayalay ko yah shakti praapt he ki vah safal ummidavaar kaa chunaav shunya ghoshit kar de
 The affected party has the right to appeal against the order of the High Court to the Supreme Court
 lok sabha prayek aam chunaav ke baad chunaav ayog dwaara adhisuchana jari kiye jane par gathit hoti he
 The first sitting of the Lok Sabha begins with the oath method
 iske nav nirvaachit sadsy ‘bharat ke samvidhan ke prati shraddha or nishtha rakhane ke liye', 'bharat kii prabhutaa or akhandta akshunn rakhane ke liye’ or ‘sansad sadsy ke kartavyon kaa shraddhapurvak nirvahan karne ke liye’ shapath lete hai
 The President invites each House of Parliament from time to time for a meeting
 prayek adhiveshan kii antim tithi ke baad raashtrapati ko chah maas ke bheetar aagaamee adhiveshan ke liye sadanon ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karnaa hota he
 Although the power to invite the Houses to the meeting is vested in the President, in practice the initiative to propose to this effect is taken by the Government
 saamanytah prativarsh sansad ke teen satr yaa adhiveshan hote hai
 Such as budget session, monsoon session and winter session
 kintu, rajyasabha ke maamle main, bajet ke adhiveshan ko do adhiveshnon main vibhajit kar diya jaataa he
 There are three to four weeks off between these two sessions
 is prakaar rajyasabha ke ek varsh main chaar adhiveshan hote hai
 Presidential address nav nirvaachit sadasyon kii shapath ke baad adhyaksh kaa chunaav hota he
 Thereafter, the President addresses both Houses of Parliament simultaneously in the Central Hall of Parliament House
 raashtrapati kaa abhibhaashan bahut mahatvapurn avasar hota he
 The address contains details of such policies and programs that are proposed to be implemented in the coming year
 saath hi, pehle varsh kii uski gatividhiyon or safaltaaon kii samiksha bhi di jaati he
 That address since the details of the policy of the government are prepared by the inter-government
 abhibhaashan par charchaa bahut vyapak rup se hoti he
 Amendments to the motion of thanks may also discuss matters which are not specifically mentioned in the address
 lok sabha sadan ke do sadasyon ko adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh ke rup main chunati he
 There is some tradition that the vice president is elected from among the members of the opposition
 praayah yah koshish rahati he ki adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh tathaa rajyasabha main sabhapati or upasabhapati kaa yah kaam he ki ve apane sadan kii kaarywahi ko vyavasthit dhang se niyamon ke anusaar chalaaen
 Parliamentary work can be divided into two main heads
 sarkari kaary or gaiyr-sarkari kaary
 Government work can then be divided into two categories, gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon ke kaary, arthath vidheyakon or sankalpon par prayek shuukravaar ke din yaa kisi aise din jo adhyaksh nirdhaarit kare dhai ghante tak charchaa kii jaati he
 The time is generally recommended by the Business Advisory Committee for various works to be done in the House
 praaia: har saptaah ek baithak hoti he
 Printed copies of the proceedings of both the Houses of Parliament are usually made available within one month after the meeting
 kaarywahi ko tepe ricard kiya jaataa he
 Session-wise printed sections of the debate are available in Hindi and English
 sarkaar apni prayek bhul chook ke liye sansad ke prati or sansad ke dwaara logon ke prati uttaradaayi hoti he
 Members of the House exercise this right, inter alia, through parliamentary questions
 sansad sadasyon ko lok mahatv ke maamalon par sarkaar ke mantriyon se jaankaree praapt karne ke liye poochne kaa adhikaar hota he
 Getting information is the parliamentary right of every non-official member
 sansad sadsy ke liye logon ke pratinidhi ke rup main yah aavashyak hota he ki use apni jimmedaariyon ke paalan ke liye sarkaar ke kriyakalapon ke bare main jaankaree ho
 The basic purpose of asking questions is to get information and know the facts on a matter of public importance
 donon sadanon main prayek baithak ke prarambh main ek ghante tak prashn kiye jate hai
 And their answers are given
 ise ‘prashnkaal’ kaha jaataa he
 In addition, ministers are also tested by asking investigative and supplementary questions to see how much they understand the functioning of their departments
 prashnkaal sansad kii kaarywahiyon kaa sabase adhik dilachasp ang he
 No other work for the newspapers for the people and for the members themselves generates as much interest as the question hour produces
 is kaal ke dauraan sadan kaa vaataavaran anishchit hota he
 Sometimes a whirlwind of tension arises, sometimes it starts saying
 kabhi kabhi kisi prashn par hone vaale katu tark-vitark se uttejnaa paidaa hoti he
 Such a situation is overcome by the reaction and humor of the members or ministers
 yahi kaaran he ki prashnkaal ke dauraan na keval sadan kaksh balki darshak evam press gailariyaan bhi sadaa lagbhag bhari rahati hai
 Some questions are given an oral answer
 inhen tarankit prashn kaha jaataa he
 Unstarred questions are given written answers
 yah baat nishchit rup se kahi ja sakati he ki sadsy prashn poochne ke adhikaar kaa prayog karne main baari ruchi dikhaate rahe hai
 Since the process of questions is relatively simple and easy
 at: yah sansadeey prakriya ke anya upayon kii tulana main sansad sadasyon main adhikadhik priy hoti ja rahi he
 In both the houses of Parliament, the time immediately after the Question Hour is commonly known as 'zero Hour' or Zero Hour
 yah ek se adhik arthon main shoonyakaal hota he
 The noon time at 12 o'clock is neither the pre-noon time nor the post-midday time
 ‘shoonyakaal’ 12 baje prarambh hone ke kaaran is naam se janaa jaataa he ise ‘aavar’ bhi kaha gaya kyonki pehle ‘shoonyakaal’ puure ghante tak chalata tha, arthath 1 baje din main sadan kaa din ke bhojan ke liye avkaash hone tak
 No one can say what matter arises during this period or what kind of attack should be made on the government
 niyamon main ‘shoonyakaal’ kaa kahin bhi koi ullekh nahin he
 At the end of the Question Hour, the members stand to raise such matters, which they feel that action cannot be delayed
 haalaanki is prakaar maamle uthaane ke liye niyamon main koi upbandh nahin he
 It seems that the idea behind this practice has been that such rules which are a hindrance for the members in raising matters of national importance or serious grievances of the people in the House immediately, are meaningless
 niyamon kii drushti se tathakthith ‘shoonyakaal’ ek aniyamitata he
 Since matters are taken up without permission or without prior notice, it wastes valuable time of the House
 isse sadan ke vidhaayi, vittiya or anya niyamit kaary kaa atikaraman hota he
 Now, on the basis of the information already given to some of the matters raised in the Zero Hour, with the permission of the Speaker, a list has also been started
 sansad ke donon sadanon ke niyamon main lok mahatv ke maamle bina deree ke or kai prakaar se uthaane kii vyavastha he
 The various processes available to each member are as follows: iske dwaara lok sabha ke niyamit kaam-kaaj ko rokkar tatkaal mahatvuparn maamle par charchaa karai ja sakati he
 Through this, any member can bring the attention of the government to the matter of immediate importance
 mantri ko us maamle main bayaan dena hota he
 Each member who calls attention has the right to ask a question
 inke dwaara tatkaal mahatv ke prashnon par ek ghante kii charchaa kii ja sakati he
 However, there is no voting on it
 hamaare nirvaachit pratinidhi kis tarah aise maamle uthaane kaa prayaas karte hai jinka niyamon evam viniyamon kii vyakhya se koi sambandh nahin hota
 But these cases are provoking him and the people of his constituency at that time
 jo maamle vyavastha ke prashn nahin hote yaa jo prashnon, alp-soochna prashnon, dhyanakarshan prastaavon aadi se sambandhit niyamon ke adheen nahin uthaae ja sakate, ve iske adheen uthaae jate hai
 The House makes a number of decisions on various matters of public importance and expresses its opinion
 koi bhi sadsy ek prastaav ke rup main koi suzav sadan ke samaksh rakh saktaa he
 In which his opinion or wish has been given
 yadi sadan use sweekaar kar letaa he to vah samooche sadan kii raay yaa ichha ban jaati he
 In the end, the 'proposal' is broadly brought before the House to know the decision of the House
 prastaav vastav main sansadeey kaarywahi kaa aadhaar hote hai
 Any matter of public importance can be the subject of a motion
 prastaav bhinn bhinn sadasyon dwaara bhinn bhinn prayojanon se pesh kiye ja sakate hai
 The proposals can be moved by ministers and also by non-government members
 gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon dwaara pesh kiye jane vaale prastaavon kaa uddeshy saamanytah kisi maamle par sarkaar kii raay yaa vichaar jaananaa hota he
 The resolution is also a procedural measure, it is available to members and ministers to raise a discussion in the House on a matter of common interest
 saamaanya rup ke prastaavon ke samaan sankalp, raay yaa sifarish kii ghoshnaa ke rup main ho saktaa he
 Or in any other form as the Speaker may deem appropriate
 mantriparishad tab tak padasin rahati he jab tak use lok sabha kaa vishwaas praapt ho
 The government has to resign constitutionally as soon as the Lok Sabha expresses distrust in the Council of Ministers
 niyamon main is aashay kaa ek prastaav pesh karne kaa upbandh he jise ‘avishvaas prastaav’ kaha jaataa he
 The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to consider a motion of no confidence
 ninda prastaav avishvaas ke prastaav se bhinn hota he
 The motion of no-confidence does not mention the reasons on which it is based
 parantu ninda prastaav main aise kaarnon yaa aaropon kaa ullekh karnaa aavashyak hota he
 The proposal is intended to condemn the government for certain policies and actions
 ninda prastaav mantriparishad ke viruddh yaa kisi ek mantri ke viruddh yaa kuch mantriyon ke viruddh pesh kiya jaataa he
 It expresses regret, indignation or surprise by the House over the failure of any minister or ministers
 sarkaar ko shashan, suraksha or jan kalyaan ke bahut se kaam karne hote hai
 All this requires a lot of resources
 ye aaen kahan se? sarkaar janata se kar vasuulati he
 It also takes loans when needed
 kyonki ham sansadeey vyavastha main rahete hai, sarkaar ke liye yah jaruri he ki koi bhi kar lagane yaa koi bhi kharchaa karne se pehle vah sansad kii manjuuri le
 In order to get this approval, every year the government presents a budget i
e
 the full year income and expenditure accounts in Parliament
 rail bajet or saamaanya bajet alag alag pesh kiye jate hai
 The general budget is usually brought on the last working day of February
 rail bajet usase kuch din pehle aa jaataa he
 The financial year begins at the first April of each year at this time
 bajet main is aashay kaa prastaav hota he ki aane vaale saal ke dauraan kis mad par kitna dhan kharch kiya janaa he
 How much money will come from it or from where it will be raised
 bajet ke aagaamee varsh ke liye anudaan die jate hai
 The government gets an opportunity to explain and explain its financial and economic policies and programs
 saath hi, sansad ko un par vichaar karne or unki aalochana karne kaa bhi avasar miltaa he
 In the process of passing the budget, serious and full discussion takes place in both houses of Parliament
 yah bajet pesh kiye jane ke kuch din baad hoti he
 The discussion begins with a general debate
 yah sansad ke donon sadanon main teen yaa chaar din tak chalati he
 The practice is that at this stage the members consider only the general aspects of the government's fiscal and economic policies
 kar lagane tathaa kharch ke byore main nahin jate
 Thus, the General Debate gives each House an opportunity to express its views
 sarkaar ko bhi abhas ho jaataa he ki kisi prastaav vishesh ke prati baad kii avasthaaon main kya pratikriya hogi
 It is to be noted that the Rajya Sabha has nothing to do with the budget other than general discussion
 maangon par matdaan keval lok sabha main hota he
 The second stage is to discuss and vote on the demands for grants
 saamanytah prayek mantralay ke liye prastaavit anudaanon ke liye alag maange rakhi jaati hai
 These 'demands' are related to the expenditure part of the budget
 inkaa swaroop karypalika dwaara lok sabha ke liye kiye gaye nivedan kaa he ki maangi gai raashi ko kharch karne kaa adhikaar diya jaae
 Discussion on demands is interesting
 charchaa ke dauraan mantralay kii nitiyon or kriyakalapon kii baariki se chaanbin kii jaati he
 Members may do so by presenting supporting proposals for the original proposal for demands for grants
 in sahaayak prastaavon ko sansadeey bhashaa main ‘katautee prastaav’ kaha jaataa he
 The process of passing the budget, from the presentation of the budget, goes on to discuss it and accept the demands for grants and till the passing of appropriations and finance bills, usually after the commencement of the current financial year
 jab tak sansad, maangen sweekrut nahin kar leti tab tak ke liye yah aavashyak he ki desh kaa prashasan chalaane ke liye sarkaar ke paas paryaapt dhan uplabdh ho
 Therefore, special provision has been made for 'vote on Account'
 jiske dwaara loksabhaa ko shakti di gai he ki vah bajet kii prakriya puri hone tak kisi vittiya varsh ke ek bhaag ke liye peshgi anudaan de sakati he
 Legislation is considered to be the primary function of Parliament
 iske liye pahal adhikanshtah karypalika dwaara kii jaati he
 The government makes legislative proposals
 us par charchaa tathaa vaad vivaad ke pashchaat sansad us par anumodan kii apni muhar lagaati he
 All legal proposals are introduced in Parliament in the form of a Bill
 vidheyak vidhaayi prastaav kaa masauda hota he
 The Bill can be introduced in any one House of Parliament by the Government or by a non-official member
 is prakaar mote taur par, vidheyak do prakaar ke hote hai: sarkari vidheyak or gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon ke vidheyak
 Most bills taking the form of legislation are government bills
 vaise to gaiyr sarkari sadasyon ke bahut kam vidheyak vidhi kaa rup lete hai
 Nevertheless, it is brought to their notice by the government and people that there is a need to amend the existing law or make any necessary legislation
 vidheyak kaa masauda us vishay se sambandhit sarkaar ke mantralay main vidhi mantralay kii sahaayta se taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 After approval of the Cabinet, it is brought before the Parliament
 sambandhit mantri dwaara use sansad ke donon sadanon main se kisi bhi sadan main pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Only in case of money bill it is prohibited that it cannot be introduced in Rajya Sabha
 adhinium kaa rup lene se purv vidheyak ko sansad main vibhinn avasthaaon se guzarana padataa he
 Each Bill has three promises in each House
 arthath pehla vaachan, doosraa vaachan or teesraa vaachan
 The introduction of the Bill is the first reading of the Bill
 pratha ke anusaar is avasthaa main charchaa nahin kii jaati he
 The second reading of the Bill is the most elaborate and important stage because it is examined in detail and closely
 jab vidheyak ke sabhi khando par or anusoochiyon par, yadi koi hon, sadan vichaar kar unhen sweekrut kar letaa he
 The minister can then propose that the bill be passed
 yah teesraa vaachan kehalaata he
 After it is passed in the House in which the Bill is introduced, it is sent to another House for concurrence
 vahaan vidheyak phir in teenon avasthaaon main se gujarata he
 An extraordinary situation arises when there is a deadlock due to disagreement between the two on a bill
 jiskaa samaadhaan donon sadanon kii sanyukt baithak main hota he
 When a bill is passed separately or jointly by both the Houses, it is sent to the President
 yadi raashtrapati anumati pradaan kar detaa he to anumati kii tithi se vidheyak adhinium ban jaataa he
 Changes can be made in any Article of the Constitution by amendment

 Parliamentary privileges are the exclusive rights that both houses of parliament, its members and committees enjoy
 visheshadhikaar is drushti se die jate hai ki sansad ke donon sadan, uski samitiyaan or sadsy swatantra rup se kaam kar saken
 Their dignity remains, but this does not mean that the status of privileged members is different from that of ordinary citizens in the eyes of the law
 jahaan tak vidhiyon ke lagu hone kaa sambandh he, sadsy logon ke pratinidhi hone ke saath saath saadhaaran naagarik bhi hote hai
 The basic law is that all citizens, including Members of Parliament, should be treated equally in the eyes of the law
 jo daayitv anya nagarikon ke hon, vahi unke bhi hote hai or shaayad sadsy hone ke naate kuch adhik hote hai
 The most important prerogative of the Parliament is the freedom of the House and its Committees to present their views with complete independence
 sansad ke kisi sadsy dwaara kahi gai kisi baat yaa die gaye kisi mat ke sambandh main uske viruddh kisi nyaayalay main koi kaarywahi nahin kii ja sakati
 Lists of parliamentary privileges can be prepared
 vastav main ye taiyaar bhi kii gayi hai parantu aisi koi bhi suchi puri nahin he
 In a small way one can say that any work which obstructs the work of the House, its committees or its members in any way violates the parliamentary privilege
 udhaaharan ke liye, koi sadsy na keval us samay giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa jabaki us sadan kaa, jiskaa ki vah sadsy ho, adhiveshan chal rahaa ho yaa jabaki us sansadeey samiti kii, jiskaa vah sadsy ho, baithak chal rahi ho, yaa jabaki donon sadanon kii sanyukt baithak chal rahi ho, yaa jabaki donon sadanon kii sanyukt baithak chal rahi ho

 The penal area of the House is not confined to its Houses and the crimes committed before them and applies to all the contempt of the House
 chaahe avmaananaa sadasyon dwaara kii gai ho yaa aise vyaktiyon dwaara jo sadsy na hon
 It also makes no difference whether the crime is committed within the House or outside its premises
 sadan kaa visheshadhikaar bhang karne yaa uski avmaananaa karne ke kaaran vyaktiyon ko dand dene kii sadan kii yah shakti sansadeey visheshadhikaar kii neenv he
 There has also been a tradition of the House that the regret expressed expressly and unconditionally by persons guilty of breach of privilege of the House or contempt of the House is accepted by the House
 aise main saadharantah sadan apni garima ko dekhte hue aise maamalon par aage kaarywahi na karne kaa faisla karata he

 Has been raja arthur ek rashtranayak kaa rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 Only in King Arthur's blurred national authority are we not infused with a sense of tenderness and depth, but in the songs of Richard Roll, we can also assume a new vivacity
 richard role england ke madhyakaalin rahasyavaadiyon main sabase bada tha
 He died in 1350
 adhikansh lekhak uttar ke athwa marasia ke the
 But now we will not live without thanking London's rise
 landan kii bhashaa pramukh ho chali or yahan in kaviyon ke naam ullekhneey samajhe jaayenge: lagland, gover or chosar
 All these were contemporary
 yadhyapi lagland adhik vayask tha, tathaapi vah gover or chosar se adhiktar miltaa rahaa hoga, kyonki landan us samay alp vistrut or ghani aabaadwala pradesh tha
 Lagland lost a lot as a poet
 uski moulik pratibha evam mahanata lupt ho chuki thi, kyonki jaan padataa he, uski pandulipiyaan bahut haathon main padi, isse kavitaaon ke moulik rup nasht ho gaye or ab koi bahut daksh sampadak hi unako antim shuddh rup dene kii aashaa kar saktaa he, kyonki dhyanpurvak padhane par yah spasht ho jaataa he ki kavi apni rachanaaon main sarvagpurn tha or un punaruktiyon or vyarth kii kavitvaheen panktiyon se sarvatha rahit tha jinhen baad ko logon ne jod diya tha
 The second drawback was that he had ingested angl-saxon verses, with his lexicography and accentuation
 usne aisa bahut kam anubhav kiya ki aangl-sackson bhashaa kii pracheen visheshtaayen mritpraaya ho rahi thim isliye bhashaa kii rupasajja main apatat: parivartan aavashyak tha
 And if his literature today is not read as much as it should be read, then the reason for it is only his verses which seem out of his ordinary reach to the readers
 unki shleshatmakataa main gati bharne or gaurav laane kii shakti nahin he
 In Gover we see such poeticity which is a bit serious
 laathini, francisi or angreji, teenon main isaki acchhee gati thi
 The main thing to note is that she does not seem to be confident in her own mother tongue, English, which at the time was the most impaired of these three
 yadhyapi isaki angreji style chosar kii bhaanti prasad evam laalityapurna nahin he to bhi saral he or yadi vah "naitik" dharanaon se thodaa bahut grast hota to waisi hi acchhee rachanaayen de saktaa tha
 Yet Chaucer had a different world
 vah shaayad lagland se bahut chota tha, kintu lagata he ki vah ek alag hi duniya main rahata tha
 Lagland was an inspired medieval poet and the first real voice of modern literature in Chaucer
 sachmuch yah ek deergh prashikshankaal tha jisamen usne francisi padya ke paramparaagat svachhndathawad kaa anusaran kiya
 Translated to the French poets, such as Jean de Myung, Guillem de Laris
 bokashiyo petrark or dante jaise mahaan italeey sahityakon ke path par chalaa
 But even in these formal compositions there were some things that showed the future greatness of the poet
 keval itnaa hi nahin tha ki vah francisi padya ke namoonay par aath matraonvaale padya saraltapurvak garh letaa tha balki yatra tatra kisi prakaar kaa nirikshan athwa bimb yah bhi bataate the ki aage koun si cheez viksit honevaali he
 But valuable material like the Canterbury Tales was unattainable in them
 yah aadhunik kaal kii sarvapratham pramanik cheez thi
 Only a part of it reflects the talent of the poet
 cantarbari kii tirthayatra ke liye yatriyon kii ek dal main ikatthe hone jaisi ek saamaanya ghatana bahut saadhaaran si prathit hoti he, jo madhyakaalin angrej tirthayatriyon ke liye swaabhaavik bhi thi, kintu aise vishay kaa yah ek sundar chayan tathaa utkrisht kala kaa udhaaharan he
 In a single stroke, Chaucer revealed it in his age-old style in a modern era, taking an important part of the life of medieval England and planning its naturalness and theatricality
 isamen chosar ne bada bhavy sansar chitrit kiya he
 Among these pilgrims are women men who keep a true replica of themselves and they themselves are true with the same firmness
 yah ek adarsh mishran he jisamen sammanit yoddha, sushila priyores, chaalaak chikitsak bath kii bahuvivaahita vaachaal patni, bahes karanevaala "rasoiyaa", neech afasar, baadmaash, ghrunit "samman taamil karanevaala", "mast frier" athwa aksen ford kaa clark, sachche vishwaas se deept ni:sruth udvaveg, sabhi ghule mili hai
 What a beautiful harmony of diversity that portrays the society of all medieval England with such clarity that it will always be immortal
 chosar kii safalataa ke koun se kaaran hai? uttar main kaha jayega, uski mahaan pratibha
 But great talent is a big word
 isamen asankhya gunon kaa samavesh he jo har nai peedi ke mahaan pratibha sambandhi gunon kii kalpana se ekadam usee rup main mail nahin khate
 Great talent throws its rays into the womb of the future and its message is conveyed in such a way that people do not fully understand it
 isliye chosar ne apane samasamayikon ke vipareet janata kii bhashaa apanaai, kintu nae chand kaa chunaav janaruchi se vipareet tha
 He first imitated the French poets and wrote eight volumes of binomials easily
 kintu use maaloom tha ki yah angreji ke anukool nahin padataa, kyonki is prakaar kii laghu maap francisi bhashaa kii pratibhaaon ke hi anukool he or kyonki uski dhwani main sambhddhata tathaa ek swar ke lop kaa adhiky he
 But due to the english-anglo-saxon background, some more space is required to speed up English
 chosar ne pentametre naamak chand diya jo angreji padya kii badi uplabdhi he
 The reciprocal solution of normans and saxons is first reflected in the chaser
 vastut: yahi angreji kaa adikavi hai jisane us kaal kii nai bhashaa angreji main apane geet gaae
 Severe deficiency of vitamins, nutrients and energy intake is called starvation
 yah kuposhan kaa sabase charam rup he
 Prolonged starvation can permanently destroy some parts of the body and eventually lead to death
 apkshay shabd bhukhmaree ke lakshanon or prabhaav kii ore sanket karata he
 According to the World Health Organization, hunger in itself is a serious problem for the overall health of the world
 dabluechao yah bhi kahata he ki ab tak shishu mrityu ke kul main se aadhe maamalon ke liye kuposhan hi uttaradaayi he
 According to the FAO, currently more than 1 billion people, or one in six people on this planet, are affected by starvation
 bhukhmaree kaa mul kaaran urja vyay or urja antargrahan ke bich asantulan he
 In other words, the body consumes more energy than it consumes as food
 yah asantulan ek yaa kai chikitsakeey kaarnon se ho saktaa he or / yaa paristithik avasthaaon ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he, jisame nimna sammilit ho sakate hai: Medical reasons paristhitijanya kaaran In a person suffering from starvation, the amount of fat and the weight of muscle decreases drastically as the body decomposes these tissues to get energy

 Vitamin deficiency is a common result of starvation, which often takes the form of anemia, beriberi, pellagra and scurvy
 sanyukt rup se yah bimaariyaan diaria, twachaa par hone vaali andhuri, shof or hryday gati rukne kaa kaaran bhi ho sakati hai
 As a result, the person suffering from it is often irritable and lazy
 pet kii kshinta bhukh ke anubhav ko kam kar detii he, kyunki anubhav pet ke us hisse dwaara niyantrit hota he jo ki khaali ho
 Starvation victims become so weak that they do not feel thirsty and therefore suffer from dehydration
 mansapeshiyon ke apkshay or shushk va fatty twachaa, jo ki gambhir nirjaleekaran ke kaaran hoti he, ke parinamswaroop sabhi kriyaayein peedaadaayak ho jaati hai
 It is common to have diseases due to a weak body
 udhaaharan ke liye, fungus praayah bhojan nalee ke andar viksit hone lagata he, jisase ki kuch bhi niglana bahut hi kshtdaayak ho jaataa he
 The natural lack of energy due to starvation leads to exhaustion and this lack of energy makes the afflicted person indifferent after prolonged stay
 kyunki bhukhmaree se peedit vyakti itnaa kamazor ho jaataa he ki vah khaane or hilne main bhi asamarth ho jaataa he or phir apane chaaron or ke vaataavaran se uskaa parsparik sambandh bhi kam hone lagata he
 The person also becomes unable to fight diseases and menstruation also becomes irregular in women
 jab bhojan grahan karnaa band ho jaataa he to, sharir dwaara sanchit glicogen 24 ghante main samaapt ho jaataa he
 The level of circulating insulin decreases and the level of glucagon increases
 urja utpaadan kaa pramukh saadhan lipolisis hota he

 In terms of insulin resistance, starvation tends to produce more glucose than is available to the brain
 bhukhmaree se peedit rogiyon kaa upachaar sambhav he, lekin yah atyant saavdhaneepurvak kiya janaa chahie jisase rifiding syndrome se bachaa ja sake
 For a person, prevention naturally involves consuming more food, this food should be so varied that it is nutritionally a complete diet
 ek sambhavit bhukhmaree se peedit vyakti ke saamne baithkar use bhojan karana, un saamaajik vyavasthaaon ke prati awaz uthaanaa jiske kaaran logon ko bhojan se vanchit rakhaa jaataa he, aadi adhik jatil maamle hai
 Assisting farmers by providing free and subsidized seeds and fertilizers in food insecurity areas will increase the crop and reduce prices
 malawi main, 13 million main se lagbhag 5 million logon ko avilamb bhojan sahaayta kii zaroorat he
 However, according to the crop assessment done by the government, the intensive food grant and seed grant supported by good rainfall in 2006 and 2007, which was lower than the manure grant, helped farmers grow unprecedented maize crops
 sarkaar ne suchit kiya ki makke kii fasal 2005 main 1
2 million metric ton se badhakar 2006 main 2
7 mmt or 2007 main 3

 This yield reduced food prices and increased the wages of farm laborers, which helped the poor
 malawi khaadya padaarthon kaa ek pramukh niryaatak ho gaya, vah sanyukt rashtron or vishwa khaadya kaarykram ko dakshini africa ke anya kisi bhi desh kii tulana main sarvaadhik makka vikray karne laga
 Until 20 years before this change in the rules, some Malawi-rich countries that depended on foreign aid were repeatedly pressuring them to reduce or eliminate food grants in the name of free market rules
 sanyukt rajya or europe dwaara apane kisaanon ko vyapak anudaan die jane ke baavjood bhi yah ho rahaa tha

 According to history, starvation was used as a death sentence
 maanav sabhyataa kii shuruyaat se lekar madhya yug tak, logon ko band kar diya jaataa tha yaa chaar deevaaron main kaid kar diya jaataa tha or wo bhojan ke abhaav main mar jate the
 In ancient graeco-roman civilization, starvation was also sometimes used to rid high-ranking guilty citizens, especially in relation to the mistaken conduct of the nobility of Rome's nobility
 For example, during the 31st year, Tiberius' niece and daughter-in-law Livila was secretly starved to death by her mother for having adultery with Sajanus and for cronyism in the murder of her husband Junior Drusas
 tiberias kii ek anya bahu, jiskaa naam agripina da elder tha bhi 33 ipu bhukhmaree ke kaaran mar gayi thi
 However, it is not clear that he himself made the decision to die of hunger
 agripina ke ek bete or beti ko bhi raajnneetik kaarnon ke chalate bhukh se maar daalane kii sajaa di gayi thi; uskaa doosraa betaa drusaas seizar, 33 ipu main karagaar main daal diya gaya tha or tiberius kii ajna dwaara use bhukh se tadapaa kar maar daalaa gaya tha ; agripina kii sabase choti beti, julia livilla, ko apane chachaa, samraat clodius, dwaara 41 wein varsh main deshnikala dekar ek dweep par chhod diya gaya tha or iske kuch samay baad hi samraji mesalina dwaara use bhukh se tadapaa kar maar daalane kii vyavastha kar di gayi thi
 It is also possible that pious virgins are convicted of starvation if they are found guilty of breaking the pledge of celibacy

 There are many Sanskrit scholars in the medieval period by the name of Hardatta - lok sahitya kaa abhipraay us sahitya se he jisaki rachana lok karata he
 Folk literature is as ancient as human, so it contains every stage of public life, every class, every time and nature
 dow satyendra ke anusaar- "lok manushya samaaj kaa vah varg he jo abhijatya sanskaar shastreeyta or paanditya kii chetana athwa ahankaar se shunya he or jo ek parampara ke pravaah main jivit rahata he
 " saadhaaran janata se sambandhit sahitya ko loksahitya kahana chahie
 Ordinary life is different from typical life, so the ideal of public literacy is different from specific literature
 kisi desh athwa kshetra kaa loksahitya vahaan kii adikaal se lekar ab tak kii un sabhi pravritiyon kaa pratik hota he jo saadhaaran janaswabhaav ke antargat aati hai
 In this literature, all kinds of feelings of life are encountered without any artificiality
 at: yadi kahin kii samoochee samskruti kaa adhyayan karnaa ho to vahaan ke loksahitya kaa vishesh avlokan karnaa padegaa
 It is less written and more verbal
 vaise hindi loksahitya ko lipibaddh karne kaa prayaas idhar kuch varshon se kiya ja rahaa he or anek granth bhi sampadit rup main saamne aae hai kintu ab bhi maukhik loksahitya bahut badi maatra main asangruhit he
 The depiction of the simplest, naturalistic expression of folk life is found in folklore and folklore, it is rare elsewhere
 lok-sahitya main lok-maanav kaa hriday bolta he
 Nature itself sings and chants
 lok-sahitya main nihit saundarya kaa moolyankan sarvatha anubhutijnya he
 From time to time, there are some special principles of folklore that survive with the help of Shruti and Smriti
 is sahitya main mukhya rup se ve rachanaayen hi sweekaar kii jaati hai athwa jivan paati hai jo anek kanthon se anek roopon main ban bigadakar ek sarvamaanya rup dhaaran kar leti hai
 This sequence has continued since time immemorial
 aisi bahut si sahityak saamagree aaj bhi prachlit he jo abhi ekarupata nahin grahan kar pai hai
 Due to traditional and collective talent, scholars have termed folk literature as "apaurusheya"
 nishchay hi paramparaagat loksahitya kisi ek vyakti kii rachana kaa parinaam nahin he
 Although many proofs can be given that the form of the same song, story or proverb as it happens at one place changes its form by reaching the other place, but a good proof would be that folklore sung for hundreds of years
 Alh-khand could not achieve uniformity till date
 is kaary main lokpravriti kisi pratibandh ko sweekaar hi nahin karti
 In Sphut songs, only the lines are moving here and there, but in the management songs and stories, the incidents also change
 yah sab hote hue bhi un prabandhon evam kathaon ke parinaamon main praaia: koi parivartan nahin sweekaar kiya jaataa
 The result and the prevailing truth and facts are taken as the basis of the event cycle arbitrarily
 ramakatha ko hi len
 The matter of "nana like Rama Avatara, Ramayan Sat Koti Apara" is 100 percent true
 ramakatha sambandhi jitani vividhtaayen loksahitya main prachlit hai yadi un sab ko ekatra kiya jaae to yah vicitra prakaar kaa "lokaramayana" granth taiyaar hoga jo abtak ke sabhi ramakhyanon se bhinn astitv kaa hoga
 Seeing the events of the cycle, sometimes it will be difficult to establish their association
 udhaahranswaroop lokgeeton main bhi ramajanm ke kai kaaran hai kintu ek bahut hi saadhaaran kaaran yah he ki ek baar jab maharaj dasharath praat: kaal sarayu main snaan karne ja rahe the to unka darshan savere hi gali main jhaadoo denevaali helin ko ho gaya
 He taunted that today, a visionless person appeared in the morning, i do not know how the day will pass
 dasharath ko yah baat lag gai or tabhi ve rani samet putraprapti ke liye van main tap karne chale gaye
 Thus, while showing the second reason, the folklorist then brings Dasaratha to a place of penance where the story mixes with the story of other Ramayana
 aise anek udhaaharan mil sakate hai jo parinaam main to nahin kintu ghatnaon ke maamle main ek nahin hai
 The folklore accepts such changes and modifications very easily
 is sahitya kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki yah anek roopon main hote hue bhi anekta main ekta kii bhaavana se yukt hota he
 Even by changing the language of the language, there is no change in sentiment
 ek hi rachana jo kisi sthal par vahaan kii boli main pai jaati he, vahi bahut dur duusari boli main bhi mil jaati he
 This journey of the stories of expressions and arrangements of sputum songs is sometimes so long that one is surprised
 kshetron evam deshon kii seemaa manushya bhale hi nirdhaarit kar de par loksahitya ise sweekaar nahin karata
 This may have been possible because during the journey the ancient man must have taken his literature with him whenever he had gone away and left his mark at the destination which would have been accepted by the people there
 yah kram aaj bhi jari he
 When a Gramya goes to the in-laws house of Naihar, she naturally takes with her the publicities of Naihar which she remembers
 yadi uskaa vivaah maayke kii boliwale kshetra main hua tab to koi baat nahin, kintu anya boli ke kshetra main vivaah hone par vah naihar ke geeton ko sthaneey boli ke lahazon main dhaal leti he
 That work is also assisted by the in-laws of the village
 is prakaar banaav bigaad baraabar chalate rahete hai
 The nature of folk singers and singers has been going on for a long time that if they like the composition of a poet, then they bend it and adapt it to their dialect
 aisa karte samay kabhi kavi kaa naam nikaal diya jaataa he or kabhi rahane diya jaataa he
 Even today, such folk songs can be heard for proof - the way the folk songs will be found in the published texts of Sur, Kabir, Tulsi and Meera, they will not have that form
 kuch lokgeeton main to anayas hi unke naam daal die gaye hai
 This trend is found not only in Hindi but also in the folklore of other languages
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki aise bhajan tathaa geet lokkaviyon dwaara swayan bana liye gaye hai or unki upyogita ko badhaane ke liye ucch evam bahushrut kaviyon ke naam jod die gaye taaki adhikansh log aise geeton ko yaad kar len
 But this is not the case
 lokkavi isi sthal par to udaar hota he
 Many such hymns have been known in the folk life since when the creators are not known
 satya to yah he ki is prakaar ke bhajanon kii sankhya namyukt bhajanon kii sankhya se kahin adhik he or ve sarasata main bhi namdhari bhajanon se ghatakar nahin hai
 There is also a tendency of folklorists to express local events immediately, as happened during the 1934 Bihar earthquake
 bahut dinon se chali aa rahi aanchalik kathatmak samagriyan isi pravriti kii dein hai
 Incidental management and folklore are born with this tendency, but only long life is available to those who touch the public with more skill
 lok-sahitya kii bhashaa shisht or saahitiyik bhashaa na hokar saadhaaran jan kii bhashaa he or uski varnya-vastu lok-jivan main gruhit charitron, bhaavon or prabhaavon tak simit he
 This was the first decree of folk literature
 isaki duusari maryaada he, uski rachana main vyakti kaa nahin balki samooche samaaj kaa samavet yogadan
 This is the reason that instead of the person's impression on folk literature, it is the impression of the whole person-world
 shilp-vidhaan kii baat karte samay ham jab in do mukhya maryaadaaon ko saamne rakhte hai to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki isamen shilp-vidhaan ke liye koi abhyaas yaa kaushal parilakshith nahin ho saktaa, kyonki shilp kaa vidhaan yadi hamen dikhaata he to vah saamaajik samarasata kii vivashtaa ke kaaran apane aap udbhoot rup main hi
 In the prevailing sense, the matter of craftsmanship cannot be raised here
 log samajhate yahi hai ki shilp ke peeche ek purv-chintit vyapaar avashya sannihit hota he or chunki lok-sahitya main aisa koi vyapaar hone kii sambhaavna nahin he isliye uske shilp-vidhaan kii baat nahin uthati
 But from a physical point of view, shilp-vidhan means to connect expression with expression
 lok-sahitya main shilp-vidhaan apane utkarsh par he, kyonki vah, sabase adhik yaheen par nirabhimaan, nirvyaj or nisargodbhoot he
 There are mainly four distinctions of folk literature; Folk-songs, folk-songs, folk-tales and folk-dramas
 lok-gaatha or lok-katha main bhed itnaa hi he ki lok-gaatha ek lambe aakhyaan-geet ke rup main chalati he or isamen prabandh-yojana gaatha-pradhan na hokar ras-pradhan hoti he, jabaki lok-katha gadyatmak hone ke saath-saath katha pradhan yaa duusare shabdon main ghatana-pradhan hua karti he
 Folk theater is limited to farce or leela based on eclectic and conversational acting keeping public theater in view
 isamen samayikta kaa vishesh dhyaan rahane ke kaaran sthaayee prabhaav daalane kii kshamta nahin hoti he
 In folklore and folklore, the craft is predominant, only the folk song is such that in which the craft-structure can develop in its overall form, these four forms of craft-structure are similar in all these forms
 As expected
 loksahitya kii jo apni kuch vishesh pravritiyaan hai ve utani hi pracheen hai jitna pracheen yah sahitya he
 Confirmation of these trends is credited with making huge and different creations
 suvidha ke liye inhen nimnlikhit prakaaron main baanta ja saktaa he : The literature related to the faith which was imposed on the human being due to the various welfare results of the nature of the primitive human beings comes under it
 isamen bhakthi evam bhay donon prakaar kii bhavanaayen sannihit hoti hai
 Literature related to superstitions composed for the worship of Gods and Goddesses is under this
 inamen kuch vishwaason ko aanchalik or kuch ko vyapak mahatv diya jaataa he
 Comprehensive compositions are found on local and extensive on local achievements
 dharti, akaash, kuna, talab, nadi, naala, dih, dyohaar, mari masaan, vriksh, fasal, paudha, pashu, daitya daanav devi devtaa, kuldevataa, brahm evam tirth aadi par jo mantra yaa geet prachlit hai ve isi ke ang hai
 Whenever villagers start an auspicious work, the songs or mantras used to please the gods and goddesses associated with it all come in this literature
 rogon ke nidaan ke liye bhi bajaay oshadhi ke geeton evam mantron kaa prayog hota he
 For example, songs of Sheetla Mata can be taken
 pruthak-pruthak devi devataaon ke liye pruthak-pruthak mantra, geet, pujan evam bhoga aadi kii samagriyan pataa nahin kab se nirdhaarit kii ja chuki hai
 Somebody likes something, but Brahma should be replaced by all these
 inhen ke anusaar geet ev mantra to badalte hi hai, saath hi pujari bhi badalte rahete hai
 Under this, literature related to ethics, ideas and practicality and various popularities comes
 aachaar-vichaar ke liye rachit sahitya main bhaawanaaon or manyataon kaa pravesh he kintu vyavhaar ke liye rache gaye sahitya main yah baat kam dekhne ko milti he
 Characterization of behavior is mainly seen in folklore
 aapasi vyavhaar kii baat to jane den
 Here the snake is also fed with milk
 vriksh ko bhi baba kaha jaataa he or badali tathaa nadiyaan bahan kaa rup dhaaran karti hai
 In the same way, the whole universe has been tied in one form by connecting with many inhuman elements and violent animals
 is sandarbh main rache hue sahitya kaa mul uddeshy vyaavhaarikta ke aadhaar par saral evam sukhi jivan vyateet karnaa he
 This is the reason that life is tied up in a relationship and caste discrimination, which is rampant, has not broken its wall
 daadi dada, bhai bahan aadi ke rishte puure gaanv main bina kisi jaateey bhedbhaav ke chalaa karte hai
 Ethos prevalent for various occasions are also part of this mode
 is sahitya ke antargat rituvidya, swasthyavigyaan, krishivigyaan, evam shakun aadi se sambhddha sahitya aata he
 This type of literature occupies a very important place in the modern scientific era in folk life
 inamen purvaacharyon dwaara nirdhaarit anubhumiyon, niyamon evam tatsambandhi upadeshaatmak baton kaa samavesh hota he
 These beliefs often stand the test of examination, but there are some exceptions as well
 rituvigyaan ke antargat ativrishti, anaavrishti evam alpavrishti ke kaarnon tathaa tajjanya kshatiyon or unase bachane ke upayon kii ore sanket kiye gaye hai
 Traditional experiences are the basis of this type of scientific literature
 chunki vah anubhav bahut pakke hote hai isliye lokgeeton kii bhanti inke banane bigadane kii sambhaavnaayen kam hua karti hai
 This is the condition of literature composed for agriculture
 iske antargat kheti se sambhddha praaia: aavashyak baaten kah di gai hai
 Scientific literature, how to cultivate the field, what type of field should be sown, what is the amount of seed, when should the irrigation be done, when is the sowing and weeding done and when is the crop harvested? Under this, besides these, crop related diseases and remedies are also described
 krishi kaaryon main kaam aanevaale upkarnon tathaa belon kii pahchaan aadi par bhi baari maatra main sahityarachana kii gai he
 Apart from bullocks, there are abundant indications about other domesticated animals
 belon ke baad saarvajanik sahitya ghodon kii pahchaan ke sambandh main praapt hota he
 Since horses are kept less now due to modern scientific vehicles, this type of literature is gradually lacking
 gaanv gaanv main tractaron ke pahunch jane se belon kii pahchaan ke bare main likhe gaye sahitya kii bhi aage shaayad yahi dasha hogi
 Other domestic animals include cattle, buffalo and dogs, but they are indicated for name only
 pakshiyon main tota, maina, kaua, muniyaan, mor, koyal tathaa kabutar aadi ke bare main sanket die gaye hai
 Under this literature, there are indications about the identification of all types of animals that are used in the use of villagers, and the benefit of them
 swasthyavigyaan main vibhinn rogon ke lakshan or unase bachane ke upaay tathaa aushadhiyon kii ore sanket miltaa he
 Which disease is caused and which practices do not cause disease or go away etc
 Things fall under it
 saath hi swasthyapradayini dincharyaan ke liye kuch aadesh bhi die gaye hai
 The identification of herbs, their uses and the benefits arising out of it are also the subjects of this department
 is tarah ke sanket praaia: aadesh ke rup main prastut kiye gaye hai or ve padyon main hai
 This method has also been adopted in literature composed for agronomy and science
 shakunvichaar sambandhi sahitya main mukhya rup se yatra aarambh karne ke liye kalkrmanusaar shubh lakshanon ko dekhte hue yaa to aadesh die gaye hai yaa apshakuton ke kaaran yatrarambh ke liye manaahi kii gai he
 If the journey is very necessary and its time does not seem to be favorable in the calculation of days, then measures have been given to avoid it
 rituon, maanav lakshanon evam pashupakshiyon kii vibhinn harkaton dwaara bhi shakun apshakun kii jaankaree is prakaar ke sahitya ke antargat karai jaati he
 As one should not leave the house during the rainy season, if he calls the cork in the morning on Mundere, he should understand the information about the arrival of a dear person, etc
 sampurna loksahitya kaa ek sarvamaanya rup to hota hi he kintu saath hi vibhinn jatiyon kii paramparaagat samskruti par aadhaarit sahitya bhi hota he
 These include the personal gods and goddesses of those castes, the order of the total deity and the rules, bye-laws and their speech as stated by the Acharyas and saintly Mahatmas
 vibhinn jatiyon jaise - nai, dhobi, ahir, chamaar, kurmi, koyri, noniyaan, baar, bhaat aadi evam vanya tathaa anya jatiyon kii pruthak pruthak samskruti jaateey loksahitya ke antargat aati he
 If it is said that the entire folk culture of somewhere is a symbol of the collective culture of different castes there and will not be inappropriate
 jaateey sahitya ko nikaal dene par loksahitya kaa jo rup batch jayega vah uskaa sachcha pratinidhitiv nahin karegaa
 The composition of this literature is different from the place of creation of specific literature
 yah loksahitya kii hi visheshta he ki uske kisi bhi prakaar kaa nirmaan ekant main nahin hota
 Generally, all those places are the creators of the said literature, where from time to time, the villagers mobilize the lover or motivated by the needs
 isiilie aisa kabhi nahin kaha ja saktaa ki loksahitya ke ang kaa aaj jo rup he vahi kal bhi tha or aage bhi bana rahegaa
 If we say that the main composition of folk literature is the chaupal and the courtyard, then it will not be irrational
 chaoupaalon main praaia: avkaash ke samay gaanv ke log ekatra ho jate hai
 a wide variety of things go on
 ritirivaajon kii charchaa, dharmacharchaa, katha-kahaniyaan, kheti baari kii baat tathaa loakgeet aadi samay samay par chaoupaalon ko mukherit karte rahete hai
 Local major events of the present period also remain the basis for negotiations for a few days
 in sabake nichod rup main jo saamagree jivan paa jaati he vahi kuch dinon baad sthaneey sahitya main shaamil ho jaati hai
 If the importance is more then the propagation of such compositions increases and they keep expanding their area from one chaupal to another and from one village to another
 is prakaar ve rachanaayen kuch varshon main vistrut loksahitya ke bhandar main sammilit ho jaati hai
 The same applies to the literature composed in the augon, where the gramayas gather from time to time
 is tarah purushon evam striyon kaa sahitya janm se hi pruthak-pruthak hota he
 Apart from chaupals and courtyards, there are some places where different genres of this literature are produced
 kheton main nirvaahee athwa katiyaa karte samay, daanth ke gatthar dhote samay, anya samuhik mazdooree karte samay, tirth athwa mela yatra main, jaade main siankal alaavon ke paas, parvon evam saanskarik aayojanon ke samay athwa sankshep main yah kahie ki jab or jahaan gramin stri purushon ke jutav kaa avasar aata he tab or tahaan loksahitya kaa nirmaan hota rahata he
 It cannot be said that all the folklore created in the past is alive and those which are being built today will never end
 sach to yah he ki is sahitya kii vidhaayen yugaprabhav ko sweekaar karke apana rup baraabar badalati rahati hai
 Looking at the literature composed within fifty years, this also becomes clear
 is avadhi main gaanvon ko jitani vaigyanik uplabdhiyaan praapt hui hai unamem adhikansh kaa samavesh loksahitya main ho chukaa he
 The folklore of this era has accepted airplanes directly, except for the magic flying arrows in the ancient folklore
 vaise loksahitya main baiylgaadee, ghoda, oont, hathi tathaa nauka aadi vaahan ab bhi jivit hai kintu motor evam railgadee ne bhi apana sthaan bana liya he
 New constructions taking place in the present period are also getting place in the said literature
 in saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath ve sabhi lakshan bhi lage hue hai jo unhen deergh jivan pradaan karte hai
 Scholars often say that if the collection of extensive folk literature is not done, they will be lost
 baat sahi he kyonki yugaprabhav ke kaaran pracheen rachanaayen anupyukt prathit hone lagati hai or phir dhire dhire lupt ho jaati hai, jaisaa ki is samay ho bhi rahaa he
 The songs of cinema have made their place in the villages, due to which the folklore is attaining attenuation
 shiksha kaa prasar hone ke kaaran bhi gaanvon kii boliyon main geet gaanevaale purushon evam striyon kaa abhaav hota ja rahaa he
 It seems that in a few days, ancient folk songs sung on the occasion of various rites will be erased and new songs will be replaced in their place, or if desired, women will study by looking at the collections of folklore and sing songs
 aataa pisanevaali kal gaanv main pahunch chuki he or bhi bahut se yantron kaa prasar hota ja rahaa he isliye "zantsar" tathaa kuch anya shram sambandhi geeton kii kami hoti ja rahi he
 Similarly, the events of the present era are also being accepted in it
 jhansi kii rani, kunwar singh, gandhi ji, subhaashachandr, bhagat singh, khudiram evam chandrashekhar aaazaad aadi loksahitya main pratishtha ke saath jivit hai
 These heroic fighters have been added to the same episode which contains the names of the heroes of ancient times
 uparyukt viven se loksahitya kaa sthaan spasht ho jaataa he kintu dharaatal se uthanevaale is sahitya ne apana ek sheershasth sthaan bhi banaaya he jahaan use vaidic sahitya ke samakaksh asana praapt he
 The proof is that many and especially ceremonial and religious works of our folk life are completed by Vedic mantras
 jahaan ye mantra sanskrit main padhe jate hai vahiin graamyaon dwaara gaae janevaale loakgeet tathaa lokachar par aadhaarit anya kriyalap bhi chalate rahete hai
 Another priest chants and the other village women sing songs
 mundan, karnavedh, yagyopavit tathaa vivaah aadi sanskaron par or makaan, dharmashala, kunaan tathaa talab aadi kaa shubharambh karte samay bhi mantra tathaa loakgeet saath saath chalate hai
 The same cultural and religious and charitable work is not found in folk life where folklore does not have a place with Vedic literature

 He said, communalism is a typhoon in which many people get entangled, but in such a time the situation of the Daman cycle worsens
 yadi kuch sneh pradarshit kiya jaay to harj hi kya he
 Pandit ji pacified the disturbance without using sticks and guns, but his policy did not suit the government of that time and that is why the government subsequently laid him off from his job
 1931 main shaikh abdulla jammu bhi aae
 He also attended Dogra Sadar Sabha in Jammu
 us samay dogra sadar sabha ke adhyaksh sardaar buddha singh the
 There Sheikh Abdullah said that the government did no good by taking Pandit Premnath Dogra out of his job and should take him back on the job

 In 1940, Panditji was elected for the first time member of Praja Sabha in Jammu
 uske pashchaat vah logon ke adhik se adhik nikat aate gaye
 During the partition of the country during 1947, there was a very dangerous and terrible political atmosphere in Jammu and Kashmir
 maharaj harisingh ko riyasat se baahar janaa padaa or yahaan jawahar laal nehru kii shah par shaikh abdulla ne apane "nayaa kashmir" ke agenda ke anusaar "alag pradhan, alag nishaan va alag vidhaan" kaa naaraa chhedaa or bhartiya tirange ke sthaan par hal ke nishaan vaala kashmir kaa laal rang kaa jhanda lahraane laga
 Naturally, these three things were not in the interest of the country, therefore, in sharp opposition to this, the Praja Parishad was formed under the leadership of Pt
 Premnath Dogra and in one country 'movement of one head, one mark and one legislation' broke out
 1949 main unhen giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 There was a movement to free them
 us samay naaraa tha "jail ke daravaaje khol do, pandit ji ko chhod do
 In this movement, Panditji went to jail three times and remained in jail for a long time, where the Sheikh Abdullah government gave him a lot of trouble

 He was the only leader of Jammu and Kashmir who was the chairman of any national party
