 These quantities are usually written in a square configuration and drawn in two vertical straight lines side by side, the determinant with n elements is called the n-order table

 By elaborating or a little consideration, the veracity of the following rules can be proved: stambh-pankti-parivartan-sabhi stambhon ko panktiyon main is prakaar parivartit karne se ki mawaan stambh badalakar mavin pankti ban jaae, saaranik kaa maan nahin badalata
 Conversely: Changing the rows in columns according to the aforesaid rule also does not change the value of the determinant
 is niyam se spasht he ki jo niyam panktiyon ke liye lagu he vaisaa hi niyam stambhon ke liye bhi lagu hoga, isliye aage ke niyam keval panktiyon ke liye hi die jaayenge
 Multiplying the determinant by an amount - Multiplying all the elements of a column of the determinant by the sum is the result of multiplying the value of the determinant by a

 The Mahatmas kept these curiosities with regard to Bhagavata Purana from Sutji: maharishi parashar or devi satyavati ke sanyog se shrinarayan ke anshavatar dev vyasaji kaa janm hua
 Vyasji, recognizing his time and the state of the society, divided the Vedas into four parts and made his four Patu disciples understand them
 iske pashchaat vedadhyayan ke adhikaar se vanchit nar-naariyon kaa mandabudhiyon ke kalyaan ke liye attharah puraanon kii rachana kii, taaki ve bhi dharm-paalan main samarth ho saken
 Sutji said - Mahatma! According to Guruji's responsibility, the responsibility of spreading and propagating seventeen Puranas came upon me, but the Bhog and Mokshadata Bhagavata Purana itself was narrated by Guruji to Janmejaya
 aap jaanate hai-janmejay ke pita raja parakshit ko takshak sarp ne das liya tha or raja ne apni hatya ke kalyaan ke liye shrimad bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya tha
 The king worshiped Lokmata Bhagwati Durga for nine days continuously and listened to the full Bhagavata Purana with the glory of Lokmata from the mouth of Muni Ved Vyasa
 sutaji ne kaha-mahatman! guruji ke aadeshaanusaar satraa puraanon ke prasar evam prachaar kaa daayitv mujh par aayaa, kintu bhoga or mokshadaata bhagwat puraana swayan guruji ne janmejay ko sunaaya

 Sri Krishna was lost in an attempt to find Prasenjit who returned safely with the blessings of Sri Devi Bhagwati
 yah vrittant maharishiyon kii ichha se vistaar se sunaate hue shri sutaji kehane lage-sajjanon ! bahut pehle dwarka puri main bhojavanshi raja satrajit rahata tha
 Due to the devotion and worship of the Sun, he received a very bright gem named Swamantak
 mani kii kranti se raja swayan surya jaisaa prabhaa-mandit ho jaataa tha
 In this confusion, when the Yadavas spoke to Shri Krishna about the arrival of Lord Surya, then Antaryami Krishna, while removing the doubts of the Yadavas, said that the upcoming nobleman Maniadhari king is Satrajit, not Surya
 swamantak mani kaa gun tha ki usko dhaaran karne vaala pratidin aath kilo swarna praapt karegaa
 There was no sign of any kind of human or divine calamity in that region
 swamantak mani praapt karne kii ichha swayan krishna ne bhi kii lekin satrajit ne asweekaar kar diya
 Once Satrajit's brother Prasenjit, wearing the gem, went on a horse and went hunting, then a lion killed him
 sanyog se jamavant naamak rich ne singh ko hi maar daalaa or vah mani ko lekar apni gupha main aa gaya
 Jamwant's daughter started playing with the jewel, thinking it was a toy
 prasenjit ke na lautne par dwarka main yah afvaah fail gai ki krishna ko satrajit dwaara mani dene se inkaar karne par durbhaavnavash krishna ne prasenjit kii hatya kara di or mani par apana adhikaar kar liya
 Unhappy with this rumor, Krishna set out to find Prasenjit
 van main krishna or unke saathiyon ne prasenjit ke saath ek singh ko bhi mara paaya
 They also found signs of bear footprints there, which indicated the entrance into the cave
 isse krishna ne singh ko maarane tathaa mani ke rich ke paas hone kaa anumaan lagaaya
 Krishna himself entered the cave by telling his companions to stay outside and wait
 kaaphi samay baad bhi krishna ke waapas na aane par niraash hokar laute saathi ne krishna ke bhi maare jane kaa mithyaa prachaar kar diya
 On Krishna's return, his father Vasudeva was distressed in his son-mourning
 usee samay maharishi naarad aa gaye
 Knowing the news, Naradji preached to Vasudeva to listen to Shrimad Devi Bhagavata Purana
 vasudev maa bhagwati kii krupa se purv parichit the
 He told Naradji - Devarshi, while imprisoned with Devaki, when the six sons were killed at the hands of Kansa, both of our husbands and wives became very upset and upset
 tab apane kul purohit maharishi garg se paraamarsh kiya or ksht se chhutkaaraa paane kaa upaay poocha
 Gurudev asked to parade the saga of Jagadamba Maa
 karagaar main hone ke kaaran mere liye yah sambhav nahin tha
 Therefore, prayed to Gurudev to get this work done
 vasudev ne kaha-meri prarthana sweekaar karke gurudev ne vindhyachal parvat par jaakar brahmanon ke saath devi kii aradhana-archana kii
 Performed a Navagna sacrifice of Goddess Bhagwat by law
 anushthan purna hone par gurudev ne mujhe isaki soochna dete hue kaha-devi ne prasann hokar yah akashwani kii he-meri prerana se swayan vishnu prithvi ke ksht nivaaran hetu vasudev devaki ke ghar avatar lenge
 Vasudev should bring that child to the house of nand-yashoda of Gokul village and bring the girl of Yashoda born at the same time and hand it to Kamsa as the eighth child
 kansa yathavat balika ko dharti par patake degaa
 That girl will immediately leave Kansa's hand and wear a celestial body, part of me will dwell on the Vidhyanchal mountain for public welfare
 garg muni ke dwaara is anushthan fal ko sun kar maine prasannataa vyakt karte hue aage ghati ghatnaayen muni ke kathananusaar puri kin or krishna kii raksha kii
 After narrating this description, Vasudev said to Naradji - Muniver! Fortunately, your arrival has proved beneficial for me
 at: aap hi mujhe devi bhagwat puraana kii katha sunaakar upakrit karen
 At the behest of Vasudeva, Narada graciously performed Navahra Parine
 vasudev ne nawein din katha samaapti par naradji kii puja-archana kii bhagwati maa kii maaya se shrikrishna jab gupha main pravisht hue to unhone ek balika ko mani se khelte dekha
 As soon as Krishna took the gem from the girl, the girl wept
 balika ke rone kii aawaaj ko sunakar jamavant vahaan aa pahunchaa tathaa krishna se yuddh karne laga
 The war lasted for twenty-seven days in both
 devi kii krupa se jamavant lagaataar camoger padataa gaya tathaa shrikrishna shakti-sampann hote gaye
 In the end he defeated Jamwant
 bhagwati kii krupa se jamavant ko purv smriti ho ai

 agyaan main kiye aparaadh ke liye kshamaa maangi
 Along with Mani, his daughter Jambavati was also happily dedicated to Krishna
 mathura main katha ke samaapt hone ke baad vasudev brahman bhoj ke baad aashirwad le rahe the, usee samay krishna mani or jambavati ke saath vahaan pahuch gaye
 There was no limit to the happiness of everyone seeing Krishna there
 bhagwati kaa aabhaar prakat karte hue vasudev-devaki ne shrikrishna kaa ashrupurit netron se swaagat kiya
 Narada returned to Devaloka after making a successful work of Vasudev

 His family did not have the support of so little money

 unase purv ek putr paidaa hote hi mar chukaa tha
 Seeing the traces of the cycle in the child's horoscope and the two fingers of both hands, an astrologer predicted - "if the child's life is somehow saved, although the chances are very low, then it will be possible to make any person in the world Strength will not stop

 Later, two daughters and two sons also died
 balykaal se hi ramprasad kii shiksha par vishesh dhyaan diya jane laga
 His mind was more in play but less in reading
 iske kaaran unke pitaaji to uski khub pitai lagaate parantu maan hameshaa pyaar se yahi samajhaati ki "betaa ram! ye bahut buree baat he mat kiya karo
 "this loving learning must have had an effect on his mind somewhere
 uske pita ne pehle hindi kaa akshar-bodh karaayaa kintu u se ullu na to unhone padhanaa siikhaa or na hi likhakar dikhaaya
 In those days only the owl was taught in Hindi alphabet

 Defeated, he was admitted to the Urdu school
 shaayad yahi prakritik gun ramprasad ko ek krantikari bana paye
 At the age of 14, Ramprasad got addicted to stealing money from his father's ark
 churaaye gayi rupayon se unhone upanyaas aadi kharidkar padhanaa prarambh kar diya evam cigarette pine va bhang chadhaane kii aadat bhi pad gayi thi
 Overall, the trend of money-theft continued and Ramprasad was now used to reading books of novels and ghazals filled with Urdu premiers
 sanyog se ek din bhang ke nashe main hone ke kaaran ramprasad ko chori karte hue pakad liya gaya
 Plenty of beating, novels and other books were torn but the habit of stealing money was not lost
 aage chalakar jab unako thodi samaj aayi tabhi ve is durgun se mukt ho sake
 Ramprasad started studying English when he did not pass the Urdu Middle examination

 The priest was a settled scholar
 unke vyaktitv kaa prabhaav ramprasad ke jivan par bhi padaa
 Due to the teachings of the priest, Ramprasad began to practice celibacy with the recitation
 pujari kii dekha-dekhi ramprasad ne vyaayaam karnaa bhi prarambh kar diya
 All the misgivings and bad habits of adolescence were in mind
 keval cigarette pine kii lat nahin chhuti
 But she too, after a few days, escaped from the discord of Sushil Chandra Sen, a schoolmate
 cigarette chhootane ke baad ramprasad kaa man padhai main lagane laga
 Very soon he entered the fifth record of English
 ramprasad main apratyaashit parivartan ho chukaa tha
 The body had become handsome and robust
 niyamit puja-paath main samay vyateet hone laga tha
 During this time he got in touch with Munshi Indrajit who came to the temple
 munshi indrajit ne ramprasad ko arya samaaj ke sambandh main bataaya or swami dayanand saraswati kii likhi pustak satyarth prakaash padhane ko di
 The serious study of Satyarth Prakash had a surprising impact on Ramprasad's life
 ramprasad jab government skool shahjahanpur main aathvin kaksha ke chaatr the tabhi sanyog se swami somdev kaa arya samaaj bhawan main aagaman hua
 Munshi Indrajit appointed Ramprasad to Swamiji's service
 yaheen se unke jivan kii dasha or disha donon main parivartan prarambh hua
 a serious study of Satyarth Prakash on the one hand and an open discussion on political subjects with Swami Somdev on the other hand aroused the feeling of patriotism in his mind

 He has mentioned this in his autobiography

 Now this book has been edited and compiled in part-three of Sarfaroshi's book titled Tamanna and can be seen in many other libraries including Teen Murti Bhawan Library, New Delhi

 An organization he had created himself under the guidance of Pandit Gandalal Dixit under the name Matriwadi

 In order to collect funds for the party, Ramprasad, who had become famous as 'bismil' till now, also committed two robberies in June 1918 and one in September 1918, making the police alert of these youths
 There were raids all over the place in search
 26 se 31 disambar 1918 tak dilli main laal kile ke saamne hue congress adhiveshan main is sanghathan ke navayuvakon ne chilla-chilla kar jaise hi pustaken bechnaa shuru kiya ki police ne chapa daalaa kintu bismil kii sujh boojh se sabhi pustaken batch gayin

 Some of his teammates went to Shahjahanpur and spread the rumor that Bhai Ramprasad was killed by a police bullet while the truth was that he jumped in the Yamuna during the police encounter and floated miles inside the water with the power of yoga practice
 Going far ahead, came out of the river and where the Greater Noida is inhabited nowadays, the uninhabited people went to the ravines
 vahaan un dinon keval babul ke hi vriksh hua karte the; or oosar jameen main aadmi to kahin dur-dur tak dikhataa hi nahin tha
 Ram Prasad Bismil took refuge in Rampur Jagir, a small village here and roamed in the uninhabited forests for several months, grazing the cow buffalo of the village goose
 iskaa bada hi rochak varnan unhone apni aatmakatha ke dwitiya khand : swadesh prem main kiya he
 While living here, he wrote his revolutionary novel, The Action of the Bolsheviks

 At present, since this village comes under the Beta Forest Sector of Greater Noida, the Government of Uttar Pradesh has developed the immortal Shaheed Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan in the memory of the Forest Department's reserved land in the area of rampur Jagir village
 Which is supervised by the Forest Department of the state with the funding of Greater Noida Administration
 'bismil' kii ek visheshta yah bhi thi ki ve kisi bhi sthaan par adhik dinon tak thaharte nahin the
 Staying at Rampur Jagir for a few days, he also stayed in Kosma District Mainpuri, the village of his real sister Shastri Devi

 Walked out of Kosma and reached Bah

 He introduced him to some publishers in Calcutta, including one Ummadatta Sharma, who later published a book titled Catharine by Ram Prasad Bismil in 1922

 Due to this he became very popular among the youth
 samooche desh main asahyog aandolan shuru karne main shahjahanpur ke swayamsevakon kii aham bhoomika thi
 But when Gandhiji withdrew the non-cooperation movement after consulting Chauri Chaura in 1922, in the Congress of 1922, Bismil and his colleagues opposed Gandhiji in such a way that two ideologies were formed in the Congress again - a liberal or Liberals and Second Rebel or Rebellion
 gandhi ji vidrohi vichaardhaara ke navayuvakon ko congress kii aam sabhaaon main virodh karne ke kaaran hameshaa hulladbaj kaha karte the
 At one time he wrote a letter to Jawaharlal Nehru and severely reprimanded for supporting the revolutionary youth

 The young men announced the Revolutionary Party as the ad hoc party

 If seen, it was his great visionary thinking at that time

 In this revolutionary published in English as The Revolutionary, the ideological thinking of revolutionaries * can be understood well
 is patr kaa avikal hindi kavyanuwaad ab hindi vicistrot par bhi uplabdh he
 Seeing this 4-page manifesto published as The Revolutionary, the British government started searching for its author in Bengal
 sanyog se shacheendra nath sanyaal bankura main us samay giraftaar kar liye gayi jab ve yah ghoshnaptr apane kisi saathi ko post karne ja rahe the
 Similarly, as soon as Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee got a party meeting from Kanpur, he got off the train at Howrah station that he was caught with a lot of copies of the HRA Constitution
 unhen hazaribagh jail main band kar diya gaya
 After the arrest of both the prominent leaders, the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh as well as the revolutionary members of Bengal came on the shoulders of Ram Prasad Bismil
 bismil kaa swabhaav tha ki ve yaa to kisi kaam ko haath main lete na the or yadi ek baar kaam haath main le liya to use puraa kiye bagaiyr chhodte na the
 There was a need for money for the work of the party earlier, but now it has increased even more
 kahin se bhi dhan praapt hota na dekh unhone 7 march 1925 ko bichpuri tathaa 24 may 1925 ko dwarkapur main do raajnneetik dakaitiyaan daaleen
 But he could not get any special money in them
 in donon dakaitiyon main ek-ek vyakti maukey par hi maaraa gaya
 Due to this, Bismil's soul suffered immensely
 antatah unhone yah pakkaa nishchay kar liya ki ve ab keval sarkari khajaana hi lootenge, hindustan ke kisi bhi rais ke ghar dakaiti bilkul na daalenge
 a decision was made at an emergency meeting held on 7 August 1925 at his house in Shahjahanpur and on 9 August 1925, a total of 10 people led by Bismil from Shahjahanpur railway station, including Ashfaq Ulla Khan, Rajendra Lahiri, Chandrashekhar Azad, Shacheendranath Bakshi, Manmathanath Gupt, Mukundi Lal, Keshav Chakraborty, Murari Sharma and Banwari Lal, boarded the 8 Down saharanpur-lucknow passenger train

 The range of these mausers was also higher than that of ordinary pistols

 Stopping at Kakori railway station before Lucknow, as soon as the train moved forward, the revolutionaries pulled the chain and stopped it and dropped the box of government treasury from the guard compartment

 Manmathnath Gupta eagerly pressed the trigger of the Maujar, causing the missed bullet to the passenger named Ahmed Ali
 vah maukey par hi dher ho gaya
 In a hurry, a sheet of leather filled with silver coins and notes was tied in sheets and a sheet was left there to escape from there

 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki police ko ghatnasthal par mili chadar main lage dhobi ke nishaan se is baat kaa pataa chal gaya ki chadar shahjahanpur ke hi kisi vyakti kii he
 On inquiring from the dhobis of Shahjahanpur it was found that the chadar was of Banarasi Lal
 banarsi laal se milakar police ne sara bhed praapt kar liya
 It was also known that on 9 August 1925, who were his partymen from Shahjahanpur went out of the city and when did they return? When intelligence was confirmed that Ram Prasad Bismil, the leader of HR was not in the city that day, then on the night of 26 September 1925, Bismil was accompanied by more than 40 people from all over India
 Was arrested

 The police broke Banarasi Lal in the lockup, fearing severe punishment
 shahjahanpur jila congress cameti main party-fund ko lekar isi banarsi kaa bismil se jhagada ho chukaa tha
 Bismil, who was then the Auditor of the District Congress Committee, suspended Banarasi from the primary membership of the Congress party, proving allegations of embezzlement in the party fund
 baad main jab gandhi ji 16 oktober 1920 ko shahjahanpur aaye to banarsi ne unase milakar apana paksh rakkha
 At that time, Gandhiji made a reconciliation between the two, saying that they should not give so much money to the small hera-hai
 parantu banarsi bada hi dhoort aadmi tha
 He first apologized to Bismil and then took Gandhiji aside and filled his ears that Ramprasad is a very criminal type
 ve isaki kisi baat kaa na to swayan vishwaas karen na hi kisi or ko karne den
 Later, this Banarasi Lal befriended Bismil and gained his trust before sweet talks and then became a partner in the cloth business with him
 jab bismil ne gandhi ji kii aalochana karte hue apni alag party bana lee to banarsi laal atyadhik prasann hua or maukey kii talash main chup saadhe baitha rahaa
 The police, knowing the difference between Bismil and Banarasi's previous quarrel with the local people, made Banarasi Lal an approver and used it as an infallible tool in the entire prosecution against Bismil
 banarsi laal vyapaar main saajheedaar hone ke kaaran party sambandhi aisi-aisi gopneey baaten jaanata tha, jinhen bismil ke atirikt or koi bhi na jaan saktaa tha
 It is mentioned by Ram Prasad Bismil in his autobiography

 After reading it, the judges expressed doubt that Bismil had written the debate with some jurist rather than himself

 kuch nyaayalayon main "sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa" or "aakraamak driving" ke bich kanoonee antar ho sakate hai
 In the US, only a few states have enacted special aggressive driving laws, where cases such as expressing fury on the road - about 1200 per year - are commonly prosecuted for assault and battery, or "ride-related homicide"
 
 1997 ke pehle se hi, sanyukt rajya america main chikitsak sadak par rosh vyakt karne ko ek chikitsa sthiti ke rup main pramanit karne ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 It is already an authentic mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders
 june 2006 main associated press dwaara prakashit lekh ke anusaar, aam taur par sadak rosh vyakt karne se jude vyavhaar pari-pari se hone vaale visphotak vikaar ke parinaam he
 This conclusion was drawn by a joint survey of some 9200 adults in the United States between 2001 and 2003 and is funded by the National Institute of Mental Health
 pari-pari se hone vaale visphotak vikaar kaa kaaran aaj tak nahin likhaa ja sakaa he
 There have been differing views on whether "expressing fury on the road" is a mental problem
 yah ho yaa nahin ho iske baavjood is baadha par kaabo paane ke liye kai vaikalpik samaadhaan hai
 Expressing fury on the road is a relatively serious task: it can be seen as a threat to the safety of the public
 tathaapi bahari avlokan dwaara manshaa kii jaanch hameshaa sambhav nahin he isliye "rod regers" jinhen police dwaara pakadaa jaataa hai unpar laaparvaah yaa asaavdhaan driving jaise anya aparaadhon kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 
 In some jurisdictions, such as the US Commonwealth of Virginia, it is easier to prosecute road rage as reckless driving rather than aggressive driving because the burden of proof does not require "intent" to successfully plead guilty
 yah sambhaavna he ki jinke kaaran "sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa" ghatnaon ke dauraan gambhir chot yaa maut jaisaa parinaam milte he unako saralata purvak laaparvaahee se isi tarah ke parinaamon ke liye lagu kiye gaye dand kii tulana main adhik gambhir dand bhugatna hoga
 In April 2007, a Colorado driver was convicted of first-degree murder in November 2005 as a result of the deaths of two drivers

 Fourteen US states have passed laws against aggressive driving
 keval ek rajya, california ne sadak par rosh vyakt karne ko ek vishesh arth dekar ise kala ke ek kanoonee shabd main badal diya he
 However, it is not to be noted that aggressive driving in Virginia is punished as a lesser offense than reckless driving
 new newjiland main sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa abhi bhi takneekee rup se kanoonee he or ise abhi bhi saamaajik rup se sweekaarya vyavhaar mana jaataa he
 Despite calls for a review of the law, the New Zealand government has no latest plans to introduce "anti-street fury" legislation like other countries such as Australia
 haalanki takneekee rup se motor yatri kaa "peechha" karnaa or jaan-boojhkar unke vaahanon ko haani pahuchana ek aparaadh he, police aam taur par aise krityon ko ek 'ucch praathamikta' ke rup main nahin maanati he or ise ek "beemaa baat" kii tarah leti he jiskaa arth he yadi kisi yatri ne uski / uskaa vaahan jaan-boojhkar ek sadak par rosh vyakt karne kii ghatana main kshatigrast kar liya he to yah aapraadhik maamle ke bajaay donon pakshon kii beemaa companiyon par nirbhar karata he ki ve isko sulajhane ke liye kya karengi isliye newjiland main kam sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa abhi bhi kanoonee he or police aise krityon ko nazarandaaj kar detii he jab tak ki vyakti maaraa na gaya ho

 Along with performing medical and chemistry work to earn a living, he used to translate English-language texts into German and other languages
 ek baar jab angarej doctor kalen kii likhi “kalens meteria medica” main varnit kunain naam kii jadi ke bare main angareji bhashaa kaa anuwaad german bhashaa main kar rahe the tab dow hanimen kaa dhyaan dow kalen ke us varnan kii ore gaya, jahaan kunain ke bare main kaha gaya ki ‘’ yadhyapi kunain malaria rog ko aarogy karti he, lekin yah swasth sharir main malaria jaise lakshan paidaa karti he
 This said Kallen sat in Dr
 Hahnemann's mind
 unhone tarkpurvak vichaar karke quinine jadi kii thodi thodi maatra roj khaanin shuru kar di
 After about two weeks, he developed malaria-like symptoms in his body
 jadi khaanaa band kar dene ke baad malaria rog apne aap aarogy ho gaya
 Dr
 Hahnemann repeated this experiment many times and each time malaria-like symptoms occurred in his body
 quinin jadi ke is prakaar se kiye gayi prayog kaa zikr dow hanimen nen apne ek chikitsak mitra se kii
 According to Dr
 Hahnemann, this friendly doctor also took the herb and he also got symptoms like malaria fever
 kuch samay baad unhone sharir or man main aushadhiyon dwaara utpann kiye gayi lakshanon, anubhavo or prabhaavon ko lipibaddh karnaa shuru kiya
 Hahnemann's extremely subtle eyes and senses concluded that more drugs should be tested and tested in a similar manner
 is prakaar se kiye gayi pareekshanon or apane anubhavon ko dow hanimen nen tatkaaleen medical patrikaon main ‘’ medicine aanf experionces ’’ sheershak se lekh likhakar prakashit karaayaa
 This can be said to be an early form of the descent of homeopathy

 karkat rogon kaa ek varg he jisamen koshikaon kaa ek samooh aniyantrit vruddhi, rog akraman or kabhi kabhi apararoopantaran athwa metastesis pradarshit karata he
 These three painful symptoms of cancer differentiate it from a benign knot, which is self-limited, not invasive, or does not show mutations
 adhikansh karkat ek gaanth yaa aburd banaate hai, lekin kuch, jaise rakt karkat gaanth nahin banaata he
 The branch of medicine that deals with the study, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cancer is called oncology or oncology
 karkat sabhi umr ke logon ko, yahan tak ki bhrun ko bhi prabhavit kar saktaa he, lekin adhikansh kismon kaa jokhim umr ke saath badhata he

 Cancer can affect all animals
 lagbhag sabhi karkat roopantarit koshikaon ke anuvanshik padaarth main asaamanyataon ke kaaran hote hai
 These abnormalities can be caused by carcinogens or carcinogens such as tobacco smoking, radiation, chemicals, or infectious factors
 Other genetic abnormalities that cause cancer may sometimes be due to an error in DNA cancer replication, or may be inherited genetically and thus present in all cells since birth
 karkat kii anuvanshikta saamanyatya carcinogen or poshak ke jinom ke bich jatil antarkriya se prabhavit hoti he
 Newer aspects of genetics of cancer pathogenesis such as DNA methylation and micrornas are increasingly gaining importance
 karkat main pai jane vaali anuvanshik asaamanyataayen aamtaur par jin ke do saamaanya virgon ko prabhavit karti hai
 Cancer-promoting tumors are typically active in cancer cells, giving new properties to those cells, such as increased growth and division than normal, protection from programmed cell death, lack of normal tissue limits, and diverse tissue environments
 Ability to be installed

 Typically, a pathologist has to undergo a histological examination of a tissue biopsy specimen to diagnose it, although early signs of malignancy may be signs of radiation-visual deprivation
 adhikansh karkat rogon kaa ilaaj kiya ja saktaa he, kuch ko thik bhi kiya ja saktaa he, yah karkat ke vishesh prakaar, sthiti or avasthaa par nirbhar karata he
 Once diagnosed, cancer can be treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy
 anusandhan ke vikaas ke saath, karkat kii vibhinn kismon ke liye upachaar or adhik vishisht ho rahe hai
 Significant progress has been made in the development of targeted therapy drugs that act exclusively on investigational molecular abnormalities in the specific knot and minimize damage in normal cells
 karkat ke rogiyon kaa purv nidaan karkat ke prakaar se bahut adhik prabhavit hota he, saath hi rog kii avasthaa or seemaa kaa bhi is par prabhaav padataa he
 In addition, histological classification and the presence of specific molecular markers can also be helpful in pre-diagnosis of disease and in determining individual treatment
 nimnlikhit nikat sambandhit shabdon kaa upyog asaamaanya vruddhi ko namit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he: In current English, though, the term is synonymous with tumor, neoplasm, especially solid neoplasm
 dhyaan den ki kuch nioplasm, jaise rakt karkat, gaanth kaa nirmaan nahin karte hai
 The following words can be used to describe a cancer
 cancer ke 100 se adhik prakaar hai
 The type of cancer is usually named for the organs or tissues where the cancer begins, but they are also known as the type of cells from which they are made
 
 Bladder cancer breast cancer colorectal cancer kidney cancer leukemia cancer cancer karkat ko koshika ke prakaar ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya jaataa he jo gaanth se samanta rakhti he, isiilie, utak ko gaanth se utpann mana ja saktaa he
 These are tissue science and place respectively
 saamaanya shrenee ke udaahranon main shaamil hai: Most of these bales are common in children
 durdam ganthon ke naam main aam taur par -carcinoma, -sarcoma yaa -blostoma jaise shabdon kaa upyog pratyay ke rup main kiya jaataa he, iske saath mul shabd ke rup main utpatti ke ang ke liye latin yaa greek shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, liver cancer is called hepatocarcinoma; Cancer of fat cells is called liposarcoma
 aam canceron ke liye, ang ke angreji naam kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, the most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma of the breast or memory ductal carcinoma
 yahan par visheshan dakatal kaa upyog sookshmdarshi main dikhaayi dene vaale us karkat ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he, jo saamaanya stan kii vahiniyon se samanta rakhti hai
 The term duct has been used to refer to the cancer of the breast vessels seen in a microscope
 saumy gaanth unke naam main -oma pratyay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jisamen mul shabd ang kaa naam hota he
 For example, a benign knot of the smooth muscle of the uterus is called a leiomyoma
 
durbhaagya se, kuch tarah ke canceron ke liye bhi -oma pratyay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jaise melanoma or seminoma
 Broadly, the symptoms of cancer can be divided into three groups: yadhyapi viksit ho chuke karkat main dard ho saktaa he, aksar yah praarambhik lakshan nahin hota he
 Each of the symptoms in the above list can be caused by a variety of conditions
 Cuttack can be a common or unusual cause for each item
 karkat bhinn rogon kaa ek varg he jo apane kaarnon or jaev-vigyaan main vyapak bhinnata rakhte hai
 Cancer can occur in any organism, even plants
 lagbhag sabhi karkat cancer dhire dhire badhate hai, karkat or cancer kii koshikaon or isaki putree koshikaon main truti utpann ho jaati he 
 Anything that replicates may possibly suffer from errors
 If error correction and prevention is not done properly, errors will persist and can also be transferred to daughter cells
 aam taur par, sharir kai vidhiyon ke madhyam se karkat ke khilaaf bachane kii koshish karata he, jaise: apoptosis, sahaayak anu, sambhavtah jeernata aadi
 However these error correction methods often fail in small ways, especially in environments where errors are more likely to occur and increase
 udhaaharan ke liye, aise vaataaran main vighatnkaaree tatv shaamil ho sakate hai jo carcinogen kehalaate hai
 Or periodic injury, or environments in which cells have not developed for their survival, such as hypoxia
 is prakaar se karkat ek pragatisheel rog he or ye pragatisheel trutiyaan dhire dhire koshika main sanchit hoti rahati hai jab tak jantu main upasthit koshika apane kaaryon ke vipareet kaary nahin karne lagati
 Errors that cause constriction are often self-amplifying, eventually increasing at an exponential rate
 udhaaharan ke liye: Thus, the sputum often explodes as a chain reaction due to some errors, these errors combined make more serious errors
 aisi trutiyaan jo adhik trutiyaan utpann karti hai, ve prabhavi rup se karkat kaa mul kaaran hai or saath hi, ye is baat kaa kaaran bhi hai ki karkat kaa upachaar bahut mushkil he: chaahe karkat kii 10,000,000,000 koshikaon main se sab ko maar dene ke baad, unamem se keval 10 koshikaayen apni pratikruti kar sakati hai yaa truti utpann karne vaale sanketon ko anya koshikaon ko bhej sakati hai to prakriya phir se shuru ho jaati he
 This rebellion-like scenario is the survival of the undesirable, where evolutionary forces themselves work against the design and system of the body

 Research about the causes of cancer often falls into the following categories: karkat rog janan kaa kaaran he DNA utparivartan jo koshika vruddhi or metastasis ko prabhavit karata he
 The substances that cause DNA mutation are called mutagens and those mutations that cause cancer are called carcinogens
 kai vishesh prakaar ke padaarth vishisht prakaar ke vikshepse jude hue hai
 Tobacco smoking is associated with many forms of cancer, and is the cause of 90% of lung cancers
 lambe samay tak esbestus fibre ke sampark main rahane se mizothelioma ho saktaa he
 Many mutagens are also carcinogens, but some carcinogens are not mutagens
 alcohol ek rasinic carcinogen kaa udhaaharan he jo utparivartajan nahin he
 Such chemicals promote cancer by stimulating the rate of cell division
 pratikruti kii tej dar anzimon kii marammat ke liye kam samay detii he jisase DNA pratikruti ke dauraan kshatigrast DNA kii marammat ke liye paryaapt samay nahin mil pataa he, jiske kaaran ek utparivartan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Several decades of research demonstrate the relationship between tobacco use and pleural, vocal, head, neck, gastric, bladder, renal, pharyngeal, and pancreatic cancers
 tambaaku dhumrapaan main nitrosemine or bahuchakree hydrocarbon sahit pachaas gyaat carcinogen paae jate hai tambaaku viksit duniya main teen main se ek cancer mrityu ke liye uttaradaayi he, or duniya bhar main lagbhag paanch main se ek mrityu ke liye
 Indeed, the pulmonary cancer mortality rate in the United States mirrors the pattern of smoking, according to which an increase in smoking leads to an increase in pleural cancer mortality and more recently demonstrated that a decrease in smoking in men There is also a decrease in pleural cancer mortality
 haalanki, duniya bhar main abhi bhi dhumrapan karne waalon kii sankhya bad rahi he, kuch sanghathanon ke dwaara iske kaaran utpann vaali sthiti ko tambaaku mahamari ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Sources of ionizing radiation, such as radon gas, can cause cancer
 surya ke parabangnee vikiran ke lambey samay tak sampark main rahane se melanoma or anya twachaa durdamataayen ho sakati hai
 Non-ionizing frequency radiations emanating from mobile phones and other sources have also been considered to cause cancer, but there is little evidence of such a relationship
 phir bhi kuch visheshgy ehtiyaati siddhant ke aadhaar par lambe samay tak ansi chizon ke sampark main rahane se bachane kii salaah dete hai
 Some cancer can be caused by infection with the pathogen
 kai cancer ek virus ke sankraman ke kaaran hote hai; yah vishesh rup se jantuon jaise pakshiyon main dekha jaataa he, lekin manushyon main bhi aisa hota he, puri duniya main 15% maanav cancer ke liye virus hi jimmedaar hai
 The main viruses related to human cancer are human papilloma virus, hepatitis b and hepatitis c virus, epstein-barr virus and human T-lymphotropic virus
 praayogic or mahamari aankde virus kii ek kaarak bhoomika kaa sanket dete hai or ve maanav main cancer ke vikaas ke liye duusare sabase mahatvapurn jokhim kaarak ke rup main saamne aaye hai, jabaki pehla kaarak tambaaku kaa upyog he
 Virus-induced lumps can be divided into two types, those that convert rapidly and those that convert slowly
 tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale virason main virus ek atisakriy onkosin ko samvaahit karata he jise viral-onkosin kaha jaataa he or sankramit koshika v-onc kii abhivyakti ke saath tunrat hi roopantarit ho jaati he
 Conversely, in a slowly mutating virus, the virus genome inserts into the genome of the host near a proto-oncogene
 ab viral pravartak yaa anya pratilekhan viniman tatv us proto-onkosin kii ati-abhivyakti kaa kaaran banate hai
 It involves uncontrolled cell division
 kyonki pravishti kaa sthaan proto-onkosin ke liye vishisht nahin hota he or kisi bhi proto-onkosin ke paas pravishti kii sambhaavna kam hoti he, dhimi gati se roopantarit hone vaale virus, tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale virus kii tulana main, sankraman ke adhik lambe samay ke baad gaanth paidaa karte hai
 The hepatitis virus, including hepatitis b and hepatitis C, can induce a long-term viral infection, which causes liver cancer in 0
47% of hepatitis b patients annually and 1
4% of hepatitis c patients per year
 liver serosis, chaahe chronic viral hepatitis sankraman ke kaaran ho yaa sharaab pine ke kaaran, yah yakrut cancer ke vikaas se sambandhit hota he or serosis or viral hepatitis kaa sangyojan yakrut cancer vikaas ke ucchtam jokhim kaa kaaran he
 Due to the transmission of viral hepatitis worldwide and the heavy burden of disease, liver cancer is one of the most common and most fatal cancers
 cancer anusandhan main aadhunikeekaran ne cancer ko rokane ke liye ek vexine ko dizin kiya he
 In 2006, U

 The Advisory Committee on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention immunization procedures officially advised that girls aged 11–12 should be vaccinated and pointed out that women from the age of 9 to girls up to the age of 26 are immune
 Are eligible for ie they can be vaccinated
 virus ke alaava, shodhakartaaon ne jeevanu or kuch vishesh prakaar ke karkat ke bich sambandh paaya he
 The most prominent example is the relationship between chronic cancer of the stomach and Helicobacter pylori of the stomach wall
 Although Helicobacter pylori infection develops in very rare cases, as this pathogen is very common, it is probably responsible for most of this type of cancer
 isi prakaar se kuch hormone gaiyr-utparivartajanik karsinogence kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, ve atirikt koshika vruddhi ko uttejit kar sakate hai
 a good example is the role of hyper estrogenic states in developing cancer of the endometrium

 AIDS - ko paribhaashit karne vaali bimariyon main lambe samay se ye nidaan shaamil hai
 The increased incidence of malignancy in HIV patients points to the breakdown of immune surveillance as a possible etiology of cancer
 anya vishisht pratiraksha kii kami kii avasthaaen bhi durdamata ke jokhim ke badhane se sambandhit hai
 Most forms of cancer are radiated, meaning they have no genetic cause
 haalanki, aise kai syndrome hai jinamein cancer ke liye anuvaanshik rup se praapt purv pravriti yaa vishesh sugrahyata hoti he, aisa aksar ek jin main dosha ke kaaran hota he jo gaanth ke nirmaan ke viruddh raksha karata he
 Famous examples are: garbhadhaaran ke saath or keval ek seemaant rup main kuch ang daataaon ke saath is rog kaa sancharan kabhi kabhi ho jaataa he, anyathaa cancer samanyatya ek sankramak rog nahin he
 The main reason for this is tissue tissue graft rejection due to major tissue homology complex incompatibility or incompatibility
 In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between "self" and "non-self" cells, as these antigens are different in each individual
 jab gaiyr swa pratijanon kaa saamana hota he, to pratiraksha tantra upyukt koshika ke khilaaf pratikriya karata he
 Such reactions protect against knot cell grafting by destroying transplanted cells
 In the United States, malignancy is found in approximately 3500 pregnant women annually, transmission of acute blood cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and carcinoma from mother to fetus via placenta
 Has been seen ang pratyaropan ke dwaara daata se vyutpann gaanth bahut kam paayi jaati he
 The main cause of the knot related to organ transplantation is Durdam melanoma, which was not known at the time of removal of the organ, although other cases were present
 vastav main, ek jeev se cancer aamtaur par usee prajati ke duusare jeev main tabhi vruddhi karata he jab un donon main samaan utak asangati ke jin hon, chuhon kaa upyog karke aisa siddh kiya gaya he; haalanki upar varnit sthiti ke alaava vaastavik duniya main aisa kabhi nahin hota he
 Some types of cancer have been found in organisms other than humans, which are caused by transmission of knot cells themselves
 yah ghatana stikar sarcoma se yukt kutton main dekhi gayi he, jo kenayan transmicible veneral tumor or tasmanian devil main devil chehre ke tumor kii beemaari ke rup main bhi jaani jaati he
 Cancer is basically a disease regulating tissue development
 ek saamaanya koshika ko cancer koshika main roopantarit karne ke liye, koshika vruddhi or vibhedan ko niyamit karne vaale jeenon main roopantaran hona chahie
 Genetic changes can occur at many levels, as an advantage or disadvantage of the whole chromosome, which is a form of mutation and only affects DNA nucleotides
 jin kii do vyapak shreniyan hai, jo in parivartanon se prabhavit hoti hai
 Oncogenes may be normal genes, which appear at inappropriately high levels, or altered genes that have novel properties
 kisi bhi maamle main, in jeenon kii abhivyakti cancer kii koshikaon ke durdam lakshan praaroop ko badhaava detii he
 Lump suppressor genes are genes that inhibit the cell division, survival, or other properties of cancer cells
 ganth kaa shaman karne vaale jin aksar cancer ko badhaava dene vaale anuvanshik parivartanon ke dwaara aksham ho jate hai
 Typically, many genes need to be transformed to convert a normal cell into a cancer cell
 vibhinn jinomik parivartanon ke liye ek vividh vargeekaran yojana he, jo cancer koshikaon ke utpaadan main yogadan kar sakati he
 Most of these changes are mutations, or changes in nucleotide sequencing of genomic DNA
 anyuploidi, gunasutron kii ek asaamaanya sankhya kii upasthiti, ek jinomik parivartan he, jo ek utparivartan nahin he or isamen samasutri vibhaajan main truti ke dwaara ek yaa adhik gunasutron kaa laabh yaa haani shaamil ho sakati he
 Large-scale mutations include damage or growth of a part of a chromosome
 Genomic amplification occurs when a cell acquires multiple copies of a small chromosomal locus, typically containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material
 sthanikaran tab hota he jab do alag alag gunasutri kshetra asaamaanya rup se, ek vishisht sthaan par sangalit ho jate hai
 a well-known example of this is the localization of the Philadelphia chromosome or chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in acute marrow-induced blood cancers, resulting in the production of the bcr-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase
 chote paimaane ke utparivartanon main shaamil hai bindu utparivartan, kami yaa badhotari, jo ek jin ke pravartak main ho sakati he, yah isaki abhivyakti ko prabhavit karti he
 Or can occur in the sequence coding of a gene and alter the stability or function of its protein product
 ekmaatr jin kaa vighatan, ek DNA virus yaa ritro virus se jinomik saamagree ke ekikaran ke parinamswarup ho saktaa he or is prakaar kii ghatana ke parinamswaroop prabhavit koshika or uski santati main viral onkosin kii abhivyakti ho sakati he
 Over-genetics is the study of the regulation of gene expression through chemical, non-mutagenic changes in DNA architecture
 cancer rogajanan main adhi-anuvaanshiki kaa siddhant he ki DNA main gaiyr utparivartaneey parivartan jin abhivyakti main parivartan kar dete hai
 In general, oncogenes are silent, for example due to DNA methylation
 is methilikaran main kshati onkosin kii vipathi abhivyakti ko prerit karti he, jo cancer rogajanan kaa kaaran he
 Known systems of over-genetic transformation include DNA methylation and methylation or acetylation of linked histone proteins at specific positions on the chromosomal DNA
 chikitsa ke varg jo HDAC sandamak or DNA mithail transfarej sandamak ke rup main jane jate hai, ve cancer koshika main adhi-anuvaanshik sanketan ko punah niyamit kar sakate hai
 Oncogenes promote cell growth in many ways
 kai hormone bana sakate hai, yah koshikaon ke bich ek rasinic sandeshvahak hota he jo samasutri vibhaajan ko prerit karata he, jiskaa prabhaav grahi utak yaa koshika ke sanket pargaman par nirbhar karata he
 In other words, when a hormone receptor is stimulated on a recipient cell, the signal is transported from the cell surface to the nucleus of the cell, affecting some changes in gene transcription regulation at the central level
 kuch onkosin khud sanket pargaman tantra kaa bhaag hote hai, yaa koshikaon or utakon main sanket grahi kaa ek bhaag hote hai, is prakaar se aise hormonon kii samvedansheeltaa ko niyantrit karte hai
 Oncogenes often produce mitosis, or engage in the transcription of DNA in protein synthesis, which makes proteins and enzymes, these proteins and enzymes are responsible for the production of products and biochemicals with which cells interact and which Cells use
 aadya-onchogin main utparivartan, jo saamanyatya onchogin ke sthir samakaksh hai, unki abhivyakti or kriya ko sanshodhit kar sakate hai or utpaada protein kii kriya yaa maatra ko badhaate hai
 When this happens, proto-oncogenes become oncogenes and this infection disturbs the normal balance of cell cycle regulation in the cell, allowing uncontrolled cell growth
 chaahe sambhav bhi ho jaye to bhi jinom main se aadya-onkosin ko hataa kar cancer ki sambhaavna ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki ve jeev kii vruddhi, marammat or samasthaapan ke liye jatil hote hai
 This only happens when they mutate and the signs of growth become excessive
 cancer anusandhan main paribhaashit kiye jane vaale pehle onkoseenon main se ek he raas onkosin
aadya-onkosin ke raas parivaar main utparivartan bahut aam hai, ye sabhi maanav ganthon ke 20% se 30% main paae jate hai
 Ras was originally identified in the Harvey sarcoma virus genome, and researchers were surprised to find that it not only had this gene presence in the human genome, but was also linked to a catalytic control element that induced cancer in cell line culture
 Could do
 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaala jin prachurodabhavan virdohi sanketon or proteinon ke liye anukoden karata he, jo samasutri vibhaajan or koshika vruddhi kaa shaman kar dete hai
 In general, knot suppressor genes are transcription factors that are activated by cellular stress or DNA damage
 aksar DNA kshati ke kaaran mukt-utplavi anuvanshik padaarth kii upasthiti or saath hi anya lakshan dekhe ja sakate hai, jo aise anzimon or maarg ko prerit karte hai jo gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ke sakriyan ke liye uttaradaayi he
 The function of such genes is to control the progression of the cell cycle for DNA repair, which prevents the mutation from being transferred to the daughter cell
 p53 protein, jo sabase zyada adhyayan kiye gaye gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon main se ek he, ek pratilekhan kaarak he jo hypoxia or parabangnee vikiran kshati sahit kai koshikeey tanavkaariyon ke dwaara sakriy hote hai
 The knotting function of its knot has not been well understood, except for about half of all cancers involved in the p53 conversion
 spasht rup se p53 ke do kaary hai: ek pratilekhan kaarak ke rup main ek nabhikeey bhoomika or doosraa koshika chakra, koshika vibhaajan or apopatosis viniman main koshika dravyi bhoomika
 According to the Warburg hypothesis, glycolysis is the preferred use of energy for the growth of cancer
 p53 shwasan se glycolitic path ko sthanantaran kaa niyaman karata he
 However, a mutation can itself damage the knotting gene by "closing it" or the signaling pathway that activates it, the invariable consequence of which DNA repair is disrupted or inhibited
 : Accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage definitely causes cancer
 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon ke utparivartan jo janan str koshikaon main utpann hote hai, ve santati main sthanantarit ho jate hai or agali pidhiyon main cancer kii sambhaavna ko badhaa dete hai
 Members of these families have increased such incidence and this has decreased the latency of multiple tumors
 gaanth ke prakaar gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale utparivartan ke prayek prakaar ke liye praroopik hote hai, kuch utparivartan vishesh prakaar ke cancer kaa kaaran hai, jabaki anya utparivartan anya prakaar ke cancer kaa kaaran hai
 The type of inheritance of a mutant tumor sedative is that an effective member inherits a defective copy from one parent and the normal copy from another parent
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vyakti jo ek utparivarti p53 elil ko vanshaagat rup se praapt karata he vah melanoma or agnashyi cancer viksit kar saktaa he jo lee-frameni syndrome kehalaata he
 Other hereditary knot suppressor gene syndromes include Rb mutations related to retino blastoma and APC gene mutations associated with adenopolyposis large intestine cancer
 Adenopolyposis large intestine cancer is associated with thousands of polyps in the large intestine in childhood, which is relatively Produce cancer of the large intestine at an early age
 ant main, BRCA1 or BRCA2 main vanshaagat utparivartan stan cancer kii praarambhik shuruyaat kaa kaaran banate hai
 In 1971, it was proposed that the development of cancer depends on at least two mutation events
 nudsan kii do chot kii pariklpana ke anusaar ek gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin main ek vanshaagat janan str utparivartan cancer ko keval tabhi utpann karegaa jab jeev ke jivan main baad main koi anya utparivartan ghatit hota he, yah us gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ke anya elil ko niskriy kar degaa
 Typically, oncogenes are effective, as they involve the action-of-gain mutation, while mutated tumor sedatives are ineffective, as they involve the action-of-loss mutation
 har koshika main samaan jin kii do pratilipiyaan hoti hai, inamen se prayek pratilipi abhibhavak se praapt kii jaati he or adhikansh maamalon ke antargat ek vishesh proto-onkosin kii keval ek pratilipi main kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan, us jin ko ek vaastavik onkosin banane ke liye paryaapt hota he
 On the other hand, the function-of-loss mutation needs to occur in both copies of the knot suppressor gene to make the gene completely dysfunctional
 haalanki, aise maamle hai jinamein gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii ek utparivartit pratilipi anya junglee-prakaar pratilipi ko kriyaaheen bana detii he
 This phenomenon is called dominant negative effect and is observed in many p53 mutations
 nudsan ke do chot ke modal ko haal hi main kai jaanchakartaaon dwaara chunauti di gai he
 Deactivation of one allele of some genes that suppress the knot is sufficient to produce a tumor
 yah ghatana agunit aparyaaptta kehalaati he or ise kai prayogtmak drushtikonon ke dwaara pradarshit kiya gaya he
 The onset of a knot resulting from haploid insufficiency is usually late, when it is compared to a two-injury process
 aksar, bahul anuvanshik parivartan jinka parinaam cancer hota he, unhen sanchit hone main kai saal lag sakate hai
 During this time, the biological behavior of pre-malignancy cells gradually changes from normal cell to cancer cell
 sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se purv durdam utak main vibhedak gun dekhe ja sakate hai
 Differential features include increased number of dividing cells, variation in nucleus size and shape, differentiation in cell size and shape, decrease in the properties of specialized cells and loss of normal tissue organization
 Dyspepsia is an unusual type of extra-cell proliferative building that is reflected by normal tissue system and loss of cell structure in pre-malignant cells
 ye praarambhik arbudeey parivartan ativardhan se vibhedit kiye jane chahiyein, jo ek bahari uddipan ke kaaran koshika vibhaajan main ek utparivarti vruddhi he, jaise hormoni asantulan yaa puraani jalan
 The most severe cases of malignancy are called "in situ carcinoma"
 latin main, "swasthani " shabd kaa arth he "sthaan main", isliye carcinoma swasthani shabd kaa arth he koshikaon kii aniyantrit vruddhi jo apane mul sthaan par hi bani rahati he or jisane anya utakon par koi akraman nahin darshaya he
 Nevertheless, carcinoma in situ can develop into an aggressive malignancy and is usually removed by surgery if possible
 jis tarah se jaanwaron kii aabaadi main vikaas hota he, thik usee tarah koshikaon kii aniyantrit aabaadi main bhi vikaas hota he
 This undesirable process is called somatic development and in this way cancer arises and becomes more painful
 koshikeey upaapachay main adhikansh parivartan jo koshika main aniyamit tareeke se vibhaajan kaa kaaran hai, ve koshika mrityu kaa kaaran hote hai
 However once the cancer starts, the cancer cells undergo a process of natural selection: some cells with new genetic changes that multiply continuously to promote their life and reproduction and develop quickly
 The knot becomes dominant, as cells with less adapted genetic changes are out of competition
 isi prakaar se MRSA jaise rogajanak pratijaivik-pratirodhi ban jate hai or yahi kaaran he ki fasalon ke blit or keet kitnashak pratirodhi ban jate hai
 Due to this development, cancer recurrence consists of cells that acquire resistance to cancer drugs

 Radiation therapy can be controlled externally by external ray radiotherapy or can be controlled internally through brachytherapy
 vikiran chikitsa kaa prabhaav sthanikrut hota he or chikitsa kiye jane vaale kshetra tak hi simit rahata he
 Radiation therapy damages or destroys the cells of the area to be treated, in this action the genetic material of these cells is destroyed to prevent further division and growth in the cells
 And destroy both normal cells, most normal cells recover from the effects of radiation and begin to function properly Are
 vikiran chikitsa kaa lakshya he adhik se adhik cancer koshikaon ko nasht karnaa, jabaki aas-paas ke swasth utakon ko hone vaale nuksaan ko simit karnaa
 Therefore, it is given in many parts, which gives healthy tissues a chance to recover in the intervening period
