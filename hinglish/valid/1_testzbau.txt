 Nutrition is the specific constructive metabolic activity under which food synthesis and digestion in plants and ingestion, digestion, absorption, ingestion of food components in heterozygous organisms lead to physical growth, repair, renewal of tissues, and biological functions, collectively
 It is called nutrition
 poshan ke antargat nimnlikhit binduon par vichaar kiya jaataa he- These are mainly due to nutritional deficiency: alpaahar se poshan kaa str upyukt nahin rahata
 This condition is called "undernutrition"
 is prakaar ke "kuposhan" kii avasthaa main ek yaa anek poshak tatv pratidin bhojan main rahete hi nahin
 Therefore, signs of malnutrition appear in the body
 "nune poshan" vaale vyakti durbal or kam vajanwaale hote hai, kintu unke sharir main koi vikruti kaa chihn dikhaai padataa
 Two elements are absolutely required for the nutrition of the body
 idhan tatv or doosraa shaareerik banaavat ke padaarth utpaadak, tantuvardhak or hraas poorak tatv
 The fuel element is required to generate power in the body
 carbohydrate, vasa ore protein ke kuch bhaag eendhan tatv hai
 Along with providing energy, all these fuels also produce heat
 ooshmaa or urja poshan ke chihn hai
 The body parts of living organisms are worn like normal instruments, but they are also repaired simultaneously, if the material to be repaired is present in the food
 jin tatwon se sharir ke avyav 18 se 20 varsh kii aayu tak banate hai, unheen tatwon ke sharir ke hraas kii purti hoti he or saath-saath sharir kii vruddhi bhi hoti he
 This work is done exclusively by proteins
 eendhan tatv se calories praapt hoti he
 Although there is a special significance of vitamins and minerals in the present era, the importance of calories for nutrition is also in its place
 eendhan tatwon kaa kaary avyavon main ooshmaa paidaa karnaa, peshiyon ko kriyavan rakhana tathaa sharir ke ucchtar kaam main bhaag lenaa he
 There are some activities in the body which also occur in a relaxed and sleepy state
 inamen se kuch kaary anaichhik rup se hote rahete hai, jaise hriday kii gati aanton main ras kaa paidaa hona, pachan or usamen gati rahanaa ityadi
 Some functions are done voluntarily, such as inhalation etc
 in sab kaamon ke liye eendhan tatwon se ooshmaa or urja milti rahati he, jo calories main maapi ja sakati he
 The physical processes that take place in a calm and relaxed state are called "base metabolism"
 iske apane kai tareeke hai
 As much as physical work increases, digestion also comes in the same proportion and heat calories also increase in the same proportion
 kuch aise dravya hai jinke seven se upaapachay kii dar bad jaati he, kintu ye manushya ke bhojan ke swaabhaavik dravya nahin hai
 They have an effect on metabolism and then also on nutrition

 In the state of fasting, the treasure of carbohydrates empties in a few hours, but the treasure of fat keeps providing heat for many days in this state
 prati din ke aahaar ke protein kaa praaia: ardhbhag eendhan ke rup main kharch hota he
 In an emergency, when the carbohydrates and fats of the body are exhausted, the protein of the muscles dissolves and provides heat
 yah badi manoranjak baat he ki baarik avyavon kaa protein bahut peeche kharch hota he or saadhaaran avyavon kaa protein lambey arase ke upwas main pehle kharch hota he
 As far as heat should be obtained for nutrition, it gets from these three food items from daily food and nutrition remains at the right level
 upwas kaal main ek ke baad doosraa khaadya tatv poshan ko kaayam rakhane main bhaag letaa he or sanchit tatv jaise jaise samaapt hote jate hen, poshan kaa str girtaa jaataa he

 The initial period of HIV that begins after its infection is called acute HIV or primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome
 In many individuals, influenza-like illness or monoucleosis in 2 to 4 weeks
 Symptoms begin to appear and some individuals do not have any such characteristic symptoms
 Symptoms of this disease start appearing in 40% to 90% of cases, with the most prominent symptoms being fever, large tender lymph nodes, swelling of the throat, palpitations, headaches or mouth and genital lesions
 Wheezing is seen in 20% -50% of cases
 In some people, opportunistic infection also develops at this stage
 kuch logon main jathrantra ki bimaariyaan jaise ulti, michali yaa dast or kuch main paridhiy neuropathy ke snaivik lakshan or jullan barre syndrome jaisi bimariyon ke lakshan dikhte hai

 Consistent use of condoms during sexual contact reduces the risk of HIV infection by approximately 80%
 When one of the pair's partner is infected with HIV, frequent use of condoms reduces the chance of HIV infection to the uninfected person by less than 1% per year
 There is also evidence of these things that the use of condom by women also provides protection similar to the use of condom for men
 According to a study, using a gel called Tenofovir on the vagina immediately before sex in African women reduced the risk of HIV infection by up to 40%
 Whereas spermicidal nonoxynol 9 in contrast increases the risk of infection because of its own tendency to increase vaginal and anal irritation
 Sunnah in sub-saharan Africa reduces the rate of HIV infection in heterosexual men by 38% –66% of cases by 24 months
 On the basis of these studies, in the year 2007, the World Health Organization and UNAID had described male circumcision as a way to prevent HIV infection from female to male
 Although this can prevent infection from male to female, it is controversial and whether male circumcision will work in developed countries or not and whether it will have any effect in gay men is still undetermined
 Some experts fear that a low perception of insecurity among circumcised men may promote sexual risk, which reduces its preventive effect
 Women who have had their female genitalia cut are at increased risk of developing HIV
 Programs showing sexual abstinence also do not appear to affect the increasing risk of HIV
 Massive sex education in school can reduce its prevalence

 purv va pashchim main vishaal jalashay he tathaa uttar kii or nand bhawan he, pashchim main mukhya imaarat gopal bhawan he, jo sabhi mehalon main sarvaadhik vishaal he
 It is three storeyed and has a large assembly hall in between
 gopal bhawan se thodi dur do choti imaaraten hai jo sawan-bhadon bhawan ke naam se jaani jaati hai
 The quadrangle has two palaces facing south and north; To the west is the Suraj Bhawan made of marble of Makrana and to the east is the Kishan Bhawan made of brown sandstone
 in donon mehalon ke bich is majboot imaarat kii chat par ek tank he jo in sabhi mehalon va bagichon main jal pravaah karti he
 According to Brockmann, this tank is unmatched in India in providing the necessary strength to the huge capacity of the store
 gopal bhawan kaa nirmaan 1780 main kiya gaya tha
 Gopal Sagar's amazing view can be seen from this building adorned with beautiful gardens
 bhawan ke donon ore do choti imaaraten hai jinhen 'sawan bhawan' or 'bhadon bhawan' ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 Marble Suraj Bhawan is located in the south direction
 yah ek hawaadaar mahal he, jisaki alankrita deevaaren va farsh man moh lete hai
 The entire building is made of marble except for the pillar of Braramde to its west and some balcony to the north
 kuch stambh va chajje balua pathar ke bane hai
 The lime has been hardened to bring uniformity
 suraj bhawan ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki iske nirmaan main taj mahal kii nakal kii gai he
 Looking at Suraj Bhavan, it is clear that this is a completely original and unmatched construction of Hindu architecture
 nukile kinare vaale maharaab, vakr, pattiyon vaale alankrita stambh aadi sabhi hindu roopak is bhawan main maujuud hai, jo ki udaipur or amer ke mehalon se samya rakhte hai
 In many rooms, there are lotus inverted Hindu metaphors in the roofs
 tharton ke anusaar deeg ke mahal main dakshin verandey ke kuch chajje, pashchim ke kuch stambh, uttar disha ke verandey kaa farsh, in sabhi main rupavaas pargane main sthit baansi paharpur kaa pathar istemaal kiya gaya he, jo style kii romaniyata or shilp kii purnataa kii drushti se itane shreshth hai ki unase batch kar keval agra kaa tajmahal he
 While the entire building is of marble
 yahan tak ki chat kii pattiyaan bhi sangemarmar kii hai
 The reason for this is that the building started in Surajmal's time and after his death it was completed in Jawahar Singh's time
 tatkaaleen raajnneetik uthal-puthal ke us daur main sambhawatah jawahar singh ke samay nirmaankalaa par utana dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 There is Kishan Bhavan along with Suraj Bhavan
 iske saamne uttari disha main nand bhawan he
 This building has a great condition like the assembly building
 jo saat bhaagon vaale maharaabadar stambhon kii panktiyon se ghira he
 Marble windows are made on both its ends
 madhyasth stambhon par aadhaarit maharaaben ytaakar rup main niojit kii gai hai
 Marble with red stone has also been used in the building
 isamen lage tode va chazzon kii lambaai 12 foot tak he
 By the time of Akbar in the Mughal period, the Bengal style roof had become part of the Rajput style
 babar dwaara bharat main prachlit kii gayi bhawan, udyaan va fawwaron kii irani-chaar-baag paddati kii vyavastha ne hindu riyasaton ke bhawanon ko ek nayaa rup pradaan kiya
 In the medieval period, there were two trends parallel to Hindu architecture
 ek parampara ke arntagat purnataya pracheen paramparaon ke anusaar nirmaan hote the
 On the other hand, the mixed style was also adopted
 yadhyapi victoria yug main vaastukala kaa vikaas hua, parantu madhya kaal ke taj mahal, humayun kaa makbara, bijapur kii gol gumbad, deeg ke jal mahal or bharatpur ke durg kaa koi sani nahin he
 The rulers of Bharatpur were not only skilled rulers, but were good art-lovers and art patrons
 unke samay main hue nirmaan vaastukala ke adbhut namoonay hai
 Badan Singh had a good knowledge of aesthetic art, architecture and architecture
 deeg ke bhawanon evam udyanon ke vinyas se yah spasht ho jaataa he
 He built beautiful buildings in the fort of Deeg, which is known as Purana Mahal
 18 veen sadi main jabaki mogul style yaa mishrit style main kaam hua, tab hindu style kaa sthaan banaaye rakhane kaa sarthak prayaas badan singh evam surajmal ne kiya
 The position of Mughal rulers was not good at that time
 mogul sultanate baari uthal puthal kaa shikaar tha
 Artisans were leaving work from the Mughal courts
 un dinon thakur badan singh kumher kii gadhi main rahete the
 While staying there, he founded the first Jat capital 'deeg' in 1725
 uske baad 1733 main bharatpur rajdhani kii sthapana surajmal ne kii
 As the political and economic situation of Bharatpur state strengthened, so did the development of architecture in Bharatpur region
 kumher kii gadhi, deeg ke jal mahal phir bharatpur durg kaa nirmaan usee vikaas ke sopan hai
 Maharaja Badan Singh prepared the plan for the buildings of Deeg and Maharaja Suraj Mal gave that plan a realization
 yahi yojanayen maharaja badansingh ke soundarya bodh kii parichaayak hai
 Maharaja Suraj Mal's interest in the field of art was in the construction of palaces and temples
 yadhyapi unke shashan kaal main sabhi jat kilon kii marammat evam punarniman kaa kaary jari rahaa, parantu swayan unka yogadan vishesh rup se bharatpur or deeg ke aadhuniktam mehalon ke nirmaan main rahaa
 In Deeg, aside from the palaces built during his father's time, which are known as old palaces, Surajmal constructed modern palaces with beautiful reservoirs and fountains, which are still magnificent and spectacular
 kavi somnath ne 'sujan vilaas' or akhairam ne 'singhaasana battisi' main deeg ke in sundar mehalon, vatika, jalashay, aadi kaa shreshth evam sundar varnan kiya he
 The construction of beautiful buildings and strong fortification was possible only through orderly and efficient planning
 yah nirmaan kaary maharaja badan singh evam surajmal ko kushal vaastushilpi hi nahin, apitu kushal vyavasthaapak, prarupakaar evam, kalamrmajna kaa pramaan detaa he
 Maharaja Suraj Mal spent a lot of money in the construction of these palaces
 kaha jaataa he ki lakhanu ke nawab gajiuddin jo maharaja surajmal ke mitra the, jab 1759 main deeg aaye to unhone bhi upharswarup bhawanon ke nirmaan ke liye dhan diya tha
 On seeing these buildings, one gets to know about the skill and beauty of the workers and artisans of that time
 saath hi yah bhi sanket milaataa he kii unhen protsaahan miltaa tha, uchit paarishramik bhi miltaa tha
 The artisans coming out of the Mughal courts were given work by Maharaja Suraj Mal
 is yojana ko karyanvit karte samay nirmaan mantri jeevanram vanchaari the
 The buildings of Deeg are large Mughal-style square gardens with palaces, with a series of fountains run by artificial water system
 mukhya dwaar singh-pole uttar disha main uttar kii or munh kiye hue hai, jisamen nand bhawanon tak fawwaron kii shrinkhlaayein hai, jo verman main bhumigat hai
 In the middle of the square gardens is a very beautiful group of fountains in 60 feet width with an octahedral shape
 is bindu ko sabhi bhawanon se fawwaron kii panktiyaan jodatii hai
 2 on the first floor of a building built in the middle of Suraj Bhawan and Kishan Bhawan
 6 lakh litre kshamta kaa ek hauj bana hua he, jo pani kii kritrim vyavastha kaa strot he
 In this, the peacocks are made by baking the clay drains
 jin par chooney kii parat chadhi hui he
 At that time, this tank was filled with the help of two pairs of oxen in about 8 days
 hauj main moriyon kii yojana is prakaar he ki sabhi fawwaare mehalon va udyanon main rang -birangi chata bikherte hai
 Both fountains of the same color and different colors run in a row at a time
 jab ye fawwaare chal kar band hote hai to uske baad udyaan ke bich jade pathar rangon se is tarah sarobar dikhte hai jaise logon ne toliyaan banaakar holi kheli ho
 This entire arrangement of fountains is technically unique
 bhawan ke pratham tal par bana apaar kshamta kaa hauj jo 225 varshon se aaj bhi apni kshamta ke anuroop kaary kar rahaa he
 These fountains not only condition the buildings but also provide artificial rain
 in fawwaron kii visheshta vidhi, rup-rang ke alaava ek dhara tathaa sahastra dhara ke rup main dekhne yogya he
 In many buildings, a meaningful attempt has been made to give them the appearance of a waterfall
 fawwaare va udyaan kritrim varsha evam rang-birange rup se mogul kaal main nirmit srinagar ke nishat baag va shalimaar baag kii vyavastha se ek kadam aage hai
 The construction of these fountains and gardens is based on the iranian-char-bagh method
 barahdari main fawwaron kii vyavastha ucch takanic kaa bemisaal prayog he
 It has a secret system of water flow
 barahdari kii duusari chat kaa bich kaa hissaa khokhla he, jisamen lohe ke gole hai
 The water access system is based on the capillary method
 jab fawwaare chalate hai to pani is hisse main pahunch kar golon ko aapas main takaraata he jo badal garajane kaa abhas detaa he
 This construction gives evidence of being a good art lover to the then ruler
 therton kaa mat he - It is clear from the observation of entire buildings that this palace complex is in fact the center of unique Indian architecture in North India
 takanic, praaroop vyavastha evam style in sabhi aadhaaron par yah shreshth bhawan he
 The only palace of Hindu style in the whole of North India is the Jal Mahal of Deeg
 in bhawanon main kaam laai gai takanic aaj bhi aadhuniktam bani hui he
 The drainage system of palaces, whether roof or floor floor, is a proof of efficient engineering
 aadhunik visheshgyon kaa mat he ki in bhawanon main neenv bharne main tajmahal vidhi kaa anusaran kiya gaya gaya he
 Presumably, buildings have been constructed on them by making square wells under them
 govardhan dren se gopal bhawan main pani aata he tathaa jab gopal sagar puraa bhar jaataa he to atirikt jal sifan vidhi se swatah hi dren ke jariye sawan mandap va nand bhawan ke kareeb se hota hua rup sagar main chalaa jaataa he
 Seeing the Suraj Bhavan as written above, it is clear that it is a completely original and unmatched construction of Hindu architecture
 nukile kinare vaale maharaab, vakr, pattiyon vaale alankrita stambh aadi sabhi hindu roopak is bhawan main maujuud hai, jo ki udaipur or amer ke mehalon se samya rakhte hai
 In many rooms, there are lotus inverted Hindu metaphors in the roofs
 belboote tajmahal va laal kile agra ke kile ke sangemarmar ke nirmaan se samya rakhte hai to iskaa kaaran yah he ki karigar mogul darbar kaa kaam chhod kar aaye the yah unki kala kaa pradarshan he na ki nakal karne kaa
 Engineer Shri J

, who took care of the buildings of the Bharatpur state in the 19th century
 Good Devanish has said about this: - "now there is a marble building in Deeg which is clearly different from the Mughal artifacts in terms of specifics
 " His entire feeling is Hindu

 Or bring them from somewhere else

 But at the same time, to reduce the load, the clay pot has been used correctly
 bharatpur va deeg ke bhawanon main ekarupata kaayam karne kaa sundar prayaas kiya gaya he
 The metaphor and embellishments, which have given a beautiful shape to the design and plan, evoke a sensitive image of a warrior but a virtuous Maharaja
 in bhawanon ke bare main prasiddh vaastuvidon ne apni-apni raay vyakt kii he
 According to the architecture Marmagya Ferguson: "the palaces of Rajasthan are built more or less disorganized and unsympathetic from the point of view of their management and all are built on a hill or high place, while the palace of Deeg is built on a completely flat ground

 The account of Arthur's story is primarily composed of folklore and literary inventions, and there are controversies and differences among modern historians regarding their historical existence
 arthur kii viral aitihaasik prishthbhumi vibhinn sroton se batori gayi he, jisamen annales cambriye, historia britonam or gildas kaa lekhan bhi shaamil he
 The name Arthur is found in early poetic sources such as Y

 mahaan arthur kii antarrashtriya ruchi kii chhavi kaa vikaas mote taur par 12 veen sadi ke historia rejum britannie main vilakshan or kalpanasheel jeffri of monmouth kii lokapriyata ke madhyam se hua
 Although in some Welsh and Breton stories and poems prior to this work, Arthur was a great warrior or magical figure of folklore, defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies, many times he appeared to be associated with another world of Welsh, a country of fairies
 is
 jeffri historia kaa kitna ansh pehle ke sroton se apanaaya gaya he or kitna jeffri ne khud avishkaar kiya he, yah agyaat he
 Although the text of the themes, events, and characters of the Arthurian legend differ widely, and there is no single authentic version, Geoffrey's version of events often contains early points of later stories
 jeffri ne varnan kiya he ki arthur britain ke raja the jinhone saxons ko haraaya tha or britain, ireland, island, norway or galle main ek samrajya kii sthapana kii thi
 In fact, many elements and events are an integral part of the Arthurian story in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the magician Merlin, the famous sword, Arthur's birth in Tintagel, his decisive war against Mordred in Kamlan, and his in Avalon The last day is included

 In these French stories, the center of the narrative often shifts away from King Arthur to other characters such as the Knights of the Round Table

 raja arthur kii dantakatha kii aitihaasikta ke aadhaar ko lekar vidwaanon dwaara lambe samay se bahes hoti rahi he
 Those who hold a view, citing Historia Britannum and Annals Cambie, consider Arthur a genuine historical figure, a romano-british leader who fought against the invading anglo-saxons sometime in the late 5th or early 6th century
 did
 historia britainum 9veen shatabdi main mili latin aitihaasik pandulipiyon main baad main paaya gaya ek sankalan he, jo ek welsh maulavee nennius ke yahaan mila jisamen baarah ladaaiyon kii suchi he jo arthur ne ladi thim
 These ended with Mons Badonicus War or Mount Baden where he is said to have killed 960 people alone
 However, recent studies have raised questions about the historia Britannum's credibility as a source of history for the period
 anya paath 10 veen sadi kaa annals kambriye he, jisamen arthur ke aitihaasik astitv ke maamle kaa samarthan kiya gaya he, jisamen mount bedan kii ladaai kii kadi arthur se bhi judi he
 The battle date in the Annals is 516–518 and also mentions the Camlan battle in which both Arthur and Medrut were killed, the dates of the battle being 537–539
 in vivaranon ko aksar historia ' vrittant mana jaataa he or is baat kii pushti kii jaati he ki arthur ne vastav main mount bedan ke saath yuddh kiya tha
 However, by identifying the problems, this source is supported by the account of Historia Britannum
 naveenatam shodh se pataa chalaa he ki annals kambriye ek itivrutt ke aadhaar par 8 veen sadi ke ant main velsshuru hua tha
 In addition, the complex text of Annals Cambriae's history has no definite impediment to the fact that Arthurian history has been added to it earlier
 is baat kii adhik sambhaavna he ki 10 veen sadi main kuch bindu par joda gaya he or ve annals ke kisi purvavarti set main astitv main nahin the
 "mount Baden's entry is probably derived from Historia Britannum
 is kshetra main vishwast karne vaale aarmabhik sabooton ke abhaav main haal ke kai itihaaskaaron ne arthur ke uttar roman britain vaale vivaran ko nikaal diya he
 In the view of the historian Thomas charles-edwards, "at this stage of inquiry one can only say that there can be a historical Arthur
 Historians cannot say anything about him yet
" This modern admission of ignorance is a relatively recent trend; The earlier generations of historians had little doubt
 itihaaskaar jon morris ne up-roman britain or ireland ke itihaas da age of arthur main arthur ke tathakthith rajya ko apane itihaas ke aayojan kaa mukhya siddhant banaaya
 phir bhi unhen aitihaasik arthur ke bare main kehane ko bahut kam mila
 Other thought groups emerged as a partial reaction to such theories that argued that Arthur had no historical existence
 morris ke age of arthur ne puratatvavid noel myress ko nirikshan karne ke liye prerit kiya "itihaas or puraana kii seemaa rekha main koi aisa vyaktitv nahin he jisane itihaaskaar kaa itnaa adhik samay barbaad kiya ho

 Arthur is not mentioned in the anglo-saxon Chronicle or is not named in any current manuscript written between 400 and 820
 uttar-roman itihaas ke pramukh praarambhik strot bede ke eslessestical history of da english pipul jisamen mount beden kaa ullekh he, main bhi unka naam anupasthit he
 Historian David Dumlisse wrote "I think we will sort out their plot very soon
 They have their place in our history book and a smoke group 'does not arise without fire'," believes it
 

 is maamle kaa tathy yah he ki arthur ke bare main koi aitihaasik saboot nahin he, ham unhen apane itihaas se, in sabase upar, apni pustakon ke ansh se khaarij kar sakate hai
 " kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki arthur multah lokkathaon ke ek kaalpanik nayak the - yaa yahaan tak ki ek arddh-vismrit kelt devtaa the - jinhen sudur ateet main sabhi kaaryon kaa vaastavik shrey diya jaataa tha
 His figure is compared with that of Kent's totem horse-gods, Hangest and Horus, which later became associated with historicity
 bede ne in mahaan vyaktiyon ko 5 veen sadi ke purvi britain ke anglo-saxon vijay kaa shrey diya he
 It is also not certain whether Arthur was considered a king in earlier texts
 Neither in Historia nor in Annales is he considered a "ruler": predecessors have instead called him the leader and soldier of war
 uttar-roman avadhi ke aitihaasik dastavej kam hai isliye arthur ke aitihaasik astitv ke prashn ke ek nishchit uttar kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Since the 12th century the places and places have been marked as Arthurian, but with archeological belief only the names have been revealed, which are found in secure references through inscriptions
 tathakthith arthur pathar 1998 main cornaval ke tintgel kile ke khandhar main paaya gaya jisamen 6 veen shatabdi ke sandarbhon ko surakshit paaya gaya, jisane ek sankshipt halchal paidaa kii lekin vah apraasangik sabit hua
 Other records of Arthur's evidence, including the Glastonbury Cross, have been described as forgery
 haalanki kai aitihaasik aankadon ko arthur ke liye aadhaar ke rup main prastaavit kiya gaya he, koi thos saboot inke abhinirdharanmen nahin ubhar paaya he
 The original Welsh name Arthur remains a subject of debate
 kuch kaa suzav he ki yah latin parivaar ke naam artorius se vyutpann hua he jo aspasht ke liye prayukt hota he, jise etimalji ne amaanya siddh karne kaa praytn kiya yaa itrusken mul kaa he)
 anya logon ke welsh ke arth se, mul rup he "bear-man", haalanki is siddhant ke saath kathinaaiyaan hai - vishesh rup se britonic yogic naam * Arto-uiros ko puraane welsh * Artgur or madhya / aadhunik welsh * Arthwr or Arthur nahin ur ban jaayegaa, jon coach ne kaha ki latin ko lekar arthur kii aitihaasikta ke sandarbh main yah sab ho saktaa he or uski taarikh 6 veen shatabdi ke baad kii honi chahie
 An alternative theory connects Arthur to Arcturus, the brightest star in the constellation Boötes Circle, near the Great Bear called Ursa Major or the Great Bear
 naam kaa arth "bhaaluu ke sangrakshak" he
 In classical Latin the word Arcturus may have evolved from the ancient Latin Arturus and when it came to Welsh it would have become Artur
 On the basis of its brightness and its position in the sky, people will be revered as "guardians of bears" and being the leaders of other stars in the constellation
 It is important to note that it does not appear that Arcturus would have been used as a personal or divine name by the Romans
 The exact significance of such etymology is unclear
 yah aksar grahan kiya jaataa rahaa he ki ek Artorius se vyutpatti kaa matlab hoga ki arthur kii kinvadantiyon kaa vaastavik aitihaasik aadhaar tha lekin haal ke adhyayanon se sanket miltaa he ki yah dharna thik se sthapit nahin he
 In contrast, the derivation of an Arthur name from Arcturus indicates that the basis of Arthur's legends is non-historical
 arthur ke parichit saahitiyik vyaktitv ke nirmaataa monmouth ke jeffri the, unka chhadam aitihaasik historia rejum britaniye 1130 dashak main likhaa gaya tha
 Textual sources regarding Arthur were generally written before Geoffrey's Historia and those that were written after him and could not escape his influence
 arthur ke praarambhik saahitiyik sandarbh welsh or breton sroton se aate hai
 In them there have been some attempts to define Arthur's nature and character as a whole rather than as a text or text / story in the pre-gulfridian tradition
 a recent academic survey by Thomas Green attempts to do this, identifying three key aspects of Arthur's portrayal based on this preceding material
 pehla yah he ki ve ek adwitiya yoddha the, jo britain par hamalaa karne vaale sabhi kshason se bachaate the or sabhi aantarik tathaa bahari khataron se raksha karte the
 Some of them were threats from humans such as the Saxons, from which they fought in Historia Britonum but most were supernatural including giant cat-demons, destructive divine pigs, dragons, dogheads, demons, and witches
 doosraa yah he ki purv galfridian arthur lokkathaon or sthaneey jaadui aashcharya-kahaniyon kaa charitra tha, jo alokik nayakon ke dal kaa mukhiya tha, jo jangalon or bhudrishy main rahata tha
 The third and final aspect is that Arthur had a close relationship with the Welsh spiritual world Annavan in early Welsh
 ek taraf ve duusari duniya ke bhawanon par khajaane kii khoj main hamale karte the or unke kaidiyon ko mukt kar dete the
 But on the other hand is the corpus of the oldest sources, including the pagan god, his wife and his possessions, which are apparently originally from another world
 arthur kaa sabase prasiddh welsh kavy sandarbh ek vir kii mrityu ke geet sangrah main aayaa he jise vaai gododdin -Y Gododdin ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jisaki rachana kaa shrey 6 veen sadi ke kavi aneirin ko diya jaataa he
 In one stanza, the bravery of a warrior is praised by a man who killed 300 enemies, but in spite of that he also said that "he was not Arthur", it is said that his feats cannot be compared to Arthur's valor
 Can
 y Gododdin is known only from a 13th-century manuscript that makes it impossible to determine whether the text is original or has been published later, but John Koch believes the text to be of a 7th century date
 Or an earlier version could not prove this; It is often suggested to have dates from the 9th - or 10th century
 talsin ko kai kavitaaon kii rachana kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jiske baar main kaha jaataa he ki vah 6 veen shatabdi kaa ek kavi tha, jisane arthur kaa bhi ullekh kiya he, haalanki in sabaki sambhavit taarikh 8 veen or 12 veen shatabdiyon ke bich kii he
 They include "qadir Tearon", with reference to "arthur the Blessed", "preiedeau Annavan", which mentions an expedition to Arthur's other world, and "mervat Vathar Penn" which refers to Arthur's valor and Arthur and Uther
 There is a discussion of the father-son relationship that dates back to Geoffrey of Monmouth
 anya praarambhik welsh arthurian granthon main carmarthea ke blike book of carmarthea main paayi gayi ek kavita bhi shaamil he, "paa gur vivi vaai porthur?" 
 yah arthur or getkiper ke bich samvaad ke rup main he jo ek kile main pravesh karnaa chahta he jisamen arthur apane or apane logon ke kaamon ko, vishesh rup se sei or bedvar ke bare main bataata he
 The Welsh prose saga Kalhwch & Olwen which is included in the modern Mbinogi collection has a very long list of Arthur's people with names of over 200 of them, though Si and Bedvar have again taken the central position
 yah kahani puure rup main arthur kii un kahaniyon kii he jisamen ve mukhyamantri yasabadadden kii beti olven ko paane ke liye asambhav kaaryon kii ek shrunkhlaa ko jeetne main, apane rishtedaar kalhavach kii madad karte hai, jisamen ek vishalkay ardh-alokik boar twarch twarch kaa shikaar shaamil he
 The 9th-century Historia Britonum also references this story, where the name of the pig is Troy T
 ant main arthur kaa zikr welsh triad main kai baar aayaa he, jo welsh parampara or dantakatha ke sankshipt saransh kaa sangrah he, jise yaad rakhane ke liye teen sambaddh samoohon yaa upakhyanon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 Later Triad manuscripts are partly taken from Geoffrey's Monmouth and later from continental traditions but which appear to have no such influence in the early years and are generally agreed to be the former Welsh tradition
 yahaan tak ki inamen arthur kii adaalat ne britain kii pratisthapana ke khilaaf pratik rup main maamla shuru kiya, arthur nyaayalay ko aksar "da island of britain" kaa vikalp bataaya gaya jiskaa "sutara britain ke dweep ke teen xxx the"
 historia britonam or annals kambriye main haalanki yah spasht nahin he ki arthur ko ek raja bhi mana jaataa tha, kalhavch and olven or treeds likhe jane ke samay ve penternedd yar ynys haan "is dweep ke yahova ke adhipatiyon ke pramukh" ban gayi the, jo wales, cornaval or uttar kii kii duusari duniya thi
 Arthur appears in a few other Latin texts, in addition to these pre-galfridian Welsh poems and stories, and the Historia Britonum and Annals Cumbrié
 vishesh rup se arthur kai uttar-roman santon ke prasiddh vite main sandarbhit hai, jinamein se kisi ko bhi aamtaur par aitihaasik sutara ke rup main vishwasaneey nahin mana jaataa he
 According to the Life of Saint Gildas, written by Karadok of Lancarfan in the early 12th century, Arthur is said to have killed Gildas' brother Heil and rescued his wife Gwenhwifer from Glastonbury
 Written around 1100, some saints before the Life of St
 Kadok or Life of Lancarfan patronized a man who killed three of Arthur's soldiers, and Arthur demanded a herd of cattle in the form of his men in exchange for his men

 "an antagonist from this point of view, Geoffrey Ashe, admits that Geoffrey's narrative is partially different from the source of the works of a 5th-century British king named Riotamus, the same character being the real Arthur, though historians and sulticists conclude Ashe's findings

 Thus for example about 60 manuscripts are included in the Welsh-language version of the Historia, first produced in the 13th century; The old belief that these earlier versions of Welsh are actually derived from Geoffrey's Historia, which was long advanced by scholars associated with ancient architecture, such as the late 18th century Lewis Morris, was abandoned by academic circles

 The popularity of Geoffrey's Historia and its other derivative works is generally agreed to be an important factor in explaining a significant number of new Arthurian works in continental Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly in France

 "before Geoffrey's creation became widely known, there is clear evidence that the continent had knowledge of the Arthur and Arthurian stories, as well as the use of Celtic names and stories not found in Geoffrey's Historia in Arthurian Romance

 Even Chretienne's work appears in Welsh Arthurian literature, with the result that the romance began to replace the active Arthur literary tradition in Arthur Welsh
 Particularly important in this development are three Welsh Arthurian romances, which are quite close to Chretien, though: Owen, r The Lady of the Fountain from Chretien's Yvain, Geraint and Enid, and Erevac of Percival

 Interest in King Arthur declined at the end of the Middle Ages
 Although the English version of Mallory's Great French Romance was popular, there was an increase in attacks on the truth of the historical structure of the Arthurian Romance — the time of Geoffrey of Monmouth — and as such The validity of the case of the whole of Britain was an attack

 The socially connected renaissance associated with the end of the medieval period conspired to steal Arthur's character, and legends about some of his powers were also stolen in order to captivate the audience, resulting in Malory's Le Morte d'arthur in 1634 Last seen in printing, which came after about 200 years

 Tennyson's work inspired a large number of followers, creating widespread interest in Arthur's stories, and bringing the character and Mallory's stories to a wider audience
 The truth is that Mallory's great compilation of Arthur's stories was first published in 1862 shortly after the arrival of the Idols with modernization and then six editions and five contestants before the end of the century
 "romance ke arthur" ke prati yah ruchi or unase sambaddh kahaniyaan puri 19 veen sadi main or 20 veen sadi main bhi barkaraar raheen or wiliam morris jaise kaviyon or pre-raphellite chitrakaaron ko prabhavit kiya jinamein, edward bern-jones bhi shaamil hai
 Even the humorous tale Tom Thumb, the primary manifestation of Arthur's legend in the 18th century, was rewritten after the publication of Idols
 jabaki tom ne apane chote aakaar ko banaae rakhaa or hasya kii raahat vaala charitra barkaraar rakhaa, uski kahani main ab madhyayugin arthurian romance se adhik tatwon ko shaamil kiya he or arthurako or adhik gambhirtha se or aitihaasik drushti se in nae sanskarnon main liya gaya he
 The revived Arthurian romance also proved to be influential in the United States, as did Sidney Lanier's book The Boys King Arthur and reached a wider audience and became the inspiration for the creation of Mark Twin's satirical a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court
 Although "arthur of Romance" has sometimes been at the center of these new Arthurian creations, on other occasions they revert to their medieval status and are either marginalized or even completely forgotten, Wagner's Arthurian Later in the opera provided a notable example

 Arthur's romance tradition is particularly clear, and according to critics, he has been subsumed by Robert Bresone in Lancelot du Lac, Eric Rohmer's Percival le Galloise and possibly John Barman in the fantasy film Excalibur; This is the main source of the Arthurian comic Monty Python and the Holy Grail

 Shikhandi is a character in the Mahabharata

 In the spirit of vengeance, he did austerities to Lord Shankar and was born to Maharaja Drupada after getting a boon from him
 shikhandi ke rup main amba kaa punarjanm hua tha
 Amba was the daughter of Kashiraj
 uski do or bahane thi jinka naam ambika or ambalika tha
 
 vivaah yogya hone par uske pita ne apni tino putriyon kaa swayamvar rachaaya
 Bhishma, the patron of Hastinapur, for the sake of his brother Vichitravirya, who was also the king of Hastinapur, killed the three daughters of Kashiraj from Swayamvar
 un teenon ko ve hastinapur le gaye
 There he finds Amba to be enamored with someone else
 bhishma ne amba ko uske premi ke paas pahunchaane kaa prabandh kar diya kintu vahaan se amba tiraskrit hokar laut aai
 Amba put the responsibility on Bhishma and insisted on marrying him
 bhishma dwaara aaajeevan brahmacharya kaa paalan karne kii pratigya se bandhe hone kaa tark die jane par bhi vah apane nishchay se vichlit nahin hui
 Amba finally vows that she will one day cause Bhishma's death
 iske liye usne ghor tapasya kii
 She was born again as the daughter of a king
 purvajanm kii smritiyon ke kaaran amba ne punah apane lakshya kii purti ke liye tapasya aarambh kar di
 Pleased with Lord Shankar's blessing to fulfill his wish, Amba was born as Shikhandi as the daughter of Maharaj Drupada
 shikhandi kaa janm panchal naresh drupad ke ghar mul rup se ek kanya ke rup main hua tha
 At the time of his birth, there was an acclaim that he should not be raised as a son but as a son
 isliye shikhandi kaa laalan-paalan purush ke samaan kiya gaya
 She was trained in martial arts and was later married
 uski vivaah ratri ke din uski patni ne satya kaa gyaan hone par uskaa apmaan kiya
 Ahat Shikhandi ran away from Panchal thinking of suicide
 tab ek yaksha ne use bachaaya or apana ling parivartan kar apana purushatv use de diya
 Thus Shikhandi returned to Panchal as a man and spent a happy married life with his wife and children
 uski mrityu ke pashchaat uskaa purushatv yaksha ko waapas mil gaya
 On the 10th day in the battle of Kurukshetra, he comes in front of Bhishma, but Bhishma recognizes Amba as him and keeps his weapons
 or tab arjuna ne amba ke peeche se unpar baanon kii bouchar laga di or unhen baan shayya par lita diya
 Thus Bhishma was defeated by Arjuna, who could not be defeated by any other method

 The film begins with Mandhari, an old handicapped man who is narrating the story of some friends to some children
 kahani main, jameendaar kaa putr rajeshwar singh or ek garib ladkaa vir singh, dost ban gaye
 Raju and Veeru start calling each other
 ve jaise-jaise bade ho jate hai, raju viru ke saath apni bahan palikanta kii shaadi kii vyavastha karne kaa faisla karata he
 However the marriage of a girl is interrupted due to in-laws seeking dowry
 viru usase shaadi karke ladki or uske mata-pita ke izzat ko bachaane ke liye kadam uthaata he
 Raju is shocked by this while his sister who used to like Veeru commits suicide
 ujadaa hua or pareshaan raju ab ghoshnaa karata he ki viru jo bhi hua uske liye puri tarah uttaradaayi he or ab uskaa jaani dushman he
 a person named Chuniya starts to extort Rajeshwar's money by keeping both the sides in battle
 chunia vir ke bete vishaal ko marava detaa he
 He thinks that Rajeshwar can do anything to eliminate Veer
 varshon main tanaav badhata he
 Mandhari, who is now described as a beggar and part of the story
 kuch bhaagyashaalee logon main se ek he, jise kisi bhi taraf se maut kaa koi dar nahin he
 Here, Rajeshwar's granddaughter Radha and Veer's grandson Vasu meet each other
 radha or vaasu shatruta se anjaan hai or pyaar main padate hai
 When Mandhari finds out about this, he happily tells the lovers the truth
 phir, vah shatruta ko samaapt karne kii apni yojanaon ko prakat karata he
 Meanwhile, Chunia completely infiltrated Rajeshwar's stronghold
 vah ek baar phir aag lagane kaa faisla karata he
 He kidnaps, rapes and murders a girl named Amala from the region of Veeru
 chunia kii chaal kaam karti he, premiyon bhi ujagar ho jate hai
 However, Chuniya's luck does not last long
 chunia ke aadamiyon ne rajeshwar par hamalaa kiya or chunia kaa asli chehre ko ujagar kiya
 a troubled Rajeshwar and a sympathetic Purna Veer finally end their decades of hostility
 yahan, chunia kii betaabi badhati he or wo radha or vaasu kaa apharan kar letaa he
 People from both sides unite to fight against Chuniya
 jald hi, radha or vaasu bachaae gaye, lekin ve is tathy se anjaan hai ki unke dadaji mil gaye hai
 Raju and Viru kill Chuniya, but are injured themselves
 jaise-jaise mitra ek-duusare kii bahon main mar jate hai, is dosti or shatruta kaa antim adhyay band ho jaataa he
 The story returns to the present which reveals that Radha and Vasu married
 unhone apane dada daadi ke naam par ek trust banaaya tha, jo bacchon ko shiksha pradaan kar rahaa he
 Mandhari is narrating the story to him only
