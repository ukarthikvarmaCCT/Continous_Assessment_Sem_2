 yadhyapi sarita ne shaalu ko apanaaya, lekin vah shaalu ke chhipe hue mata-pita kii sachai ko nahin bhul saki or isliye vah apni asli beti nimmi ko die gaye pyaar ko use nahin detii
 Shalu on the other hand loves Sarita a lot
 jise vah apni asli maa maanati he
 She constantly wants her mother's affection but doesn't get it
 isaliye wo baagi bhi he
 Unlike her mother, Nimmi loves Shalu very much and constantly saves her
 haalanki vah apni maa ke baari main galat nahin sochati or na hi koi paksh leti he
 a young man named Dev Khanna enters the lives of sisters
 dev or shaalu shuruyaat main saath nahin hote lekin dhire-dhire pyaar main padate hai
 However Nimmi believes that Dev falls in love with her, not Shalu
 sarita, jise keval nimmi ke paksh ke bare main jaankaree he, nimmi kii ore se dev ke pita ko vivaah prastaav pradaan karti he
 Mr
 Khanna is taken aback as he is aware of the relationship between Dev and Shalu
 jab sarita dev or shaalu ko snehi karte hui dekhati he, to vah is nishkarsh par pahunchati he ki shaalu ne nimmi se dev chura liya he
 As Shalu's mother stole Shekhar away from him
 sarita krodh main shaalu se sammukh hoti he or nimmi ke saamne uski asli viraasat kaa khulaasa karti he
 Shalu decides to sacrifice Dev to please her mother and sister
 jab dev shaalu se yah jaanata he, to vah bhramit or niraash hota he
 But finally agree to marry Nimmi to please Shalu

 He has really loved her for years
 sagaai ke din, sarita ke raajnneetik pratidwandvi shaalu kii avaidh viraasat kaa upyog karne kii koshish karte hai taaki nimmi or dev ke vivaah ko roka ja sake
 Shalu goes to Dev's house
 jahaan usne saarvajanik rup se dev ke puure parivaar ke saamne ghoshnaa kii ki vah vivaah se baahar paidaa hui thi
 She says that Sarita's kindness and generosity is evidence that she adopted Shalu in her family and it would be an injustice if the marriage was completely annulled
 shri khanna shaalu ke saahas se prabhavit hote hai or vaada karte hai ki shaadi ko nahin roka jayega
 Sarita secretly listens to Shalu and this is deeply rooted in her heart
 vah sharminda hoti he ki usne shaalu ke saath kaisaa vyavhaar kiya
 They hug her for the first time
 sarita kahati he ki agar shaalu or dev vastav main pyaar main hai to vah nimmi ko alag hatane ke liye kahegi
 Shalu stops them from doing so and says that now that she has got her mother's love and acceptance, she wants nothing more
 nimmi bahut khush hai ki unki maa ne shaalu ko sweekaar kar liya he
 But she still feels that something is not right with her sister
 vah jald hi samir se puri jaankaree paati he or khushi se shaalu or dev ke liye apane kadam peeche uthaati he

 Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad, British India
 unke pita, motilal nehru, ek dhani barrister jo kashmiri pandit samudaay se the, swatantrata sangram ke dauraan bhartiya rashtriya congress ke do baar adhyaksh chune gaye
 His mother Swarooprani Thusu, from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife and the first wife died during childbirth

 Jawaharlal Nehru returned to India in 1912 and started advocacy
 1916 main unki shaadi kamala nehru se hui
 Jawaharlal Nehru joined the Home Rule League in 1917
 raajnneeti main unki asli diksha do saal baad 1919 main hui jab ve mahatma gandhi ke sampark main aae
 At that time Mahatma Gandhi launched a campaign against the Rowlatt Act
 nehru, mahatma gandhi ke sakriy lekin shantipurna, savinay avagya andolan ke prati khaase aakarshith hue
 Nehru also adapted his family according to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi
 jawaharlal or motilal nehru ne pashchimi kapadon or mahangi sampatti kaa tyaag kar diya
 He now started wearing a Khadi kurta and Gandhi cap
 jawahar laal nehru ne 1920-1922 main asahyog andolan main sakriy hissaa liya or is dauraan pehali baar giraftaar kiye gaye
 He was released after a few months
 jawaharlal nehru 1924 main elahabaad nagar nigam ke adhyaksh chune gaye or unhone shahar ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ke rup main do varsh tak seva kii
 He resigned in 1926 citing lack of cooperation from the British authorities
 1926 se 1928 tak, jawahar laal nehru ne akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke mahasachiv ke rup main seva kii
 In 1928-29, the annual session of the Congress was held under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 us satr main jawaharlal nehru or subhash chandra bose ne puri raajnneetik swatantraaa kii maang kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki motilal nehru or anya netaaon ne british samrajya ke bheetar hi prabhutv sampann rajya kaa darja paane kii maang kaa samarthan kiya
 To resolve the issue, Gandhi took a middle ground and said that Britain would be given two years to grant the status of the state of India and if it did not, the Congress would launch a national struggle for complete political independence
 nehru or bose ne maang kii ki is samay ko kam kar ke ek saal kar diya jaae
 The British government did not respond to this
 disambar 1929 main, congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan lahore main yojit kiya gaya jisamen jawaharlal nehru congress party ke adhyaksh chune gaye
 During this session, a resolution was also passed demanding 'complete self-rule'
 26 janvari 1930 ko lahore main jawaharlal nehru ne swatantra bharat kaa jhanda fahraaya
 Gandhiji also called for the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930
 andolan khaasaa safal rahaa or isane british sarkaar ko pramukh raajnneetik sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 When the British Government promulgated the India Act 1935, the Congress Party decided to contest elections
 nehru chunaav ke baahar rahe lekin zoron ke saath party ke liye rashtravyapee abhiyaan chalaaya
 The Congress formed governments in almost every province and won the largest number of seats in the Central Assembly
 nehru congress ke adhyaksh pad ke liye 1936 or 1937 main chune gaye the
 He was also arrested during the Quit India Movement in 1942 and released in 1945
 1947 main bharat or pakistan kii aazaadee ke samay unhone angreji sarkaar ke saath hui vaartaon main mahatvapurn bhagidaari kii
 When India got independence in 1947, when the Congress voted for the future Prime Minister, Sardar Patel got the most votes
 uske baad sarvaadhik mat acharya kriplani ko mili the
 But at the behest of Gandhiji, Sardar Patel and Acharya Kripalani withdrew their names and Jawaharlal Nehru was made the Prime Minister
 1947 main ve swatantra bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri bane
 The British had liberated around 500 princely states together and the biggest challenge at that time was to bring them under one flag
 unhone bharat ke punargathan ke raste main ubhari har chunauti kaa samajhadaari purvak saamana kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru played an important role in the making of modern India
 unhone yojana ayog kaa gathan kiya, vigyaan or praudyogiki ke vikaas ko protsaahit kiya or teen lagaataar panchavarshiya yojanaon kaa shubharambh kiya
 Due to their policies, a new era of agriculture and industry started in the country
 nehru ne bharat kii videsh niti ke vikaas main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 Jawaharlal Nehru, together with Josip Burrows Tito and Abdul Gamal Nasir, created a non-aligned movement for the elimination of colonialism in Asia and Africa
 vah korian yuddh kaa ant karne, suez nahar vivaad sulajhane or congou samjhaute ko murtarup dene jaise anya antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan main madhyasth kii bhoomika main rahe
 He also contributed significantly behind the scenes in resolving many other explosive issues like West Berlin, Austria and Laos
 unhen varsh 1955 main bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya
 But Nehru could not improve India's relations with Pakistan and China
 pakistan ke saath ek samjhaute tak pahunchne main kashmir mudda or china ke saath mitrataa main seemaa vivaad raste ke pathar sabit hue
 Nehru also extended a hand of friendship towards China, but in 1962, China attacked by deception
 nehru ke liye yah ek bada jhatka tha or shaayad unki maut bhi isi kaaran hui
 On 27 May 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru suffered a heart attack in which he died
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki nehru ne anya netaaon kii tulana main bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut kam yogadan diya tha phir bhi gandhiji ne unhe bharat kaa pratham pradhanmantri bana diya
 For several decades after independence, the heirs of power in Indian democracy have run a monarchy in the country from time to time, revered individual worship in place of ideology and completely neglected the public interest while indulging in the aura of so-called popularity
 nehru ko mahatma gandhi ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke taur janaa jaataa he
 It is also alleged on Gandhi that he did the work of advancing Nehru in politics at the expense of many able leaders including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 jab aazaadee ke thik pehle congress adhyaksh banane kii baat thi or mana ja rahaa tha ki jo congress adhyaksh banegaa vahi aaazaad bharat kaa pehla pradhanmantri hoga tab bhi gandhi ne pradesh congress samitiyon kii siforeeshon ko andekha karte hue nehru ko hi adhyaksh banane kii disha main safaltaapurvak prayaas kiya
 This creates a general belief that Nehru must have not only done the work of advancing the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi but he must have tried his best to complete the tasks which Gandhi himself could not complete
 lekin sachai iske ulat he
 It was none other than Jayaprakash Narayan, who once worked as a team with Nehru, in the role of 1978 book 'gandhi Today'
 jepi ne nehru ke bare main kuch kaha he to uski vishwasaneeyata ko lekar koi andeh nahin hona chahie kyonki nehru se jepi kii najdiki bhi thi or mitrataa bhi
 Despite this, JP highlighted the shortcomings of the Nehru model
 april 2015 main yah bhi khulaasa hua ki swatantraaa ke baad nehru ne bees varshon tak ibi dwaara netaji ke sambandhiyon kii jasusi karaayi
 Away from all political controversies, Nehru was undoubtedly a good writer
 raajnneetik kshetra main lokmaanya tilak ke baad jam kar likhane vaale netaaon main ve alag se pahachaane jate hai
 The areas of both are different, but there is a considerable amount of consistency in the writing of both
 nehru ji swabhaav se hi swadhyaayi the
 He studied great texts
 sabhi rajnatik uttejnaaon ke baavjood ve swadhyay ke liye roj hi samay nikaal liya karte the
 As a result, the books composed by him also give a simple feeling of being the creation of a study-able person
 nehru ji ne vyavasthit rup se anek pustakon kii rachana kii he
 The solution to the extreme lack of time for writing in the busiest struggling days of political life was to make the long dull days of jail a creative one
 isliye unki adhikansh pustaken jail main hi likhi gayi hai
 In his writings, a mixed form of the spirit of a litterateur and the searching heart of a historian has emerged
 indira gandhi ko kaalpanik patr likhane ke bahaane unhone vishwa itihaas kaa adhyay-dar-adhyay likh daalaa
 These letters were never actually sent, but by this, a simple communicative and well-written text like a glimpse of world history was easily prepared
 bharat kii khoj ne lokapriyata ke alag pratimaan rache hai, jis par aadhaarit bharat ek khoj naam se ek uttam dharawahik kaa nirmaan bhi hua he
 His autobiography About my story, the well-known Manishi Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan believes that his autobiography, which narrates the story of his life and struggle without trying to prove self-pity or moral superiority, is one of the most notable books of our era
 Is one of in pustakon ke atirikt nehru ji ne aganit vyaakhyaan diye, lekh likhe tathaa patr likhe

 bhavanaayen karmchaariyon ko kaam din kaa ek mahatvapurn visheshta he
 The idea of emotional labor affects every aspect of life, not just at the workplace
 bhaavana kaa kaam teen tarah ke hote he: sangyanatmak, shaareerik, or arthpurna
 Cognitive emotion attempts to alter images or ideas within the work in hopes of changing the emotions associated with the logo
 udaahan dete hue kah sakate he ki khushi ke bhaavana apni parivaar ki tasviir se juda sakate he or khushi kaa prayaas karne ke liye kah gaye tasviir ko dekh sakate he
 Physical emotion attempts to change the physical symptoms of generating the desired emotion at work
 udhaaharan, gahari saans lene se log apane krodh ko kam karne kaa prayaas karte he
 In semantic emotion work, there have been attempts to change the semantic gestures to replace the internal emotions
 udhaaharan, khushi mahasoos karne ke liye muskuraane kaa prayaas karne lagata he
 According to sociologist Arlie Hochshield, jobs associated with emotional labor can be defined as those below jobs; hoyshild kaa tark he ki is badlaav se seva shramikon ko kaarysthal main apni bhaawanaaon se bichad rahe hai
 In the past, emotional labor demands and performance regulations have been seen as a feature of particular occupations such as workers, cashiers, hospital workers, bill submission, consultants, secretaries, and nurses
 haalanki, pradarshan niyamon kii avadharana kiya gaya he na keval vishesh vyavsaayik samoohon kii bhoomika aavashyaktaaon ke rup main hi nahin balki parsparik naukari kii maang ke rup main bhi jo vyavsaayon ke kai prakaar ke dwaara saajha gaya he
 According to Larsen and Yao, physicians should interact sympathetically with their patients because mutual relationships between physicians and patients are essential for quality health
 larsan or yaao ke anusaar chikitsakon do madhyam se bhaavnaatmak shram k mahasoos karte he, gahari abhinay or sataha abhinay
 Deep acting practitioners display sincere sympathy
 sataha abhinay main chikitsakon rogi kii ore nakli sahanubhuti kaa vyavhaar karte he
 Larsen and Yao preferred deep acting but when it is impossible for patients to behave with sincere empathy, physicians can rely on surface acting
 larsan or yaao charchaa karte he ki chikitsakon adhik prabhavi or adhik peshewar santushti he jab bhaavnaatmak shram karne ke liye gahari abhinay ke madhyam se sahanubhuti main sanlagn karte he
 Police work involves satisfactory emotional labor by officers, who must control the emotion displaying their own faces and bodies in the presence of other officers and civilians
 martin ke anusaar wo police adhikari jo bahut zyada krodh, sahanubhuti, yaa anya bhaavana naukari par khatre ke saath kaam karte hue pradarshan kaarta he anya adhikariyon se police kaam ke dabaav kaa saamana karne main asamarth ke rup main dekha jaayegaa
 Being able to balance this self-management of emotions in front of other officers must use effective interpersonal skills to restore police persuasion order and gain civic trust and compliance
 ant main, prabhavi rup se bhaavnaatmak shram main sanlagn karne ke liye police adhikariyon kii kshamta, anya adhikariyon or nagarikon ke dharna ko prabhavit karata he
 Paules was studying waitress in Philadelphia
 unhone jaanch kiya ki jab karmchaario graahakon ke saath baatcheet kar rahe the ve kis tarah se niyantran kaa pradarshan karte he or swayan kii pahchaan ko raksha karte he
 Paulus discusses that the deep-rooted beliefs generated by cultural symbols about service work imply workers' subordination to customers
 poles ke adhyayan main vetreso niyokta ke viniyamit main nahin the or isliye grahako se hote huye baatcheet ko apane aap hi niyantran karte the
 Despite the restaurant work image and slavery beliefs, their interactions with customers were not negatively affected
 ve apane bhaawanaaon ko prabandhan karne vaale kshamta ko ek moolyawaan kaushal maanate he jise graahakon par niyantran hasil karne ke liye istemaal kar sakate he
 Paulus has highlighted the positive results of emotional labor of the specific population of the waitresso, other scholars have also highlighted some of its negative consequences
 bayard de volon atthara maheene kii avadhi tak ek pratibhaagi avlokan anusandhan kaa aayojan kiya jisase usne dekha ki kisino ke vetreso par atyadhik nazar rakhaa gaya he or kaarysthal main bhaavnaatmak shram pradarshan karne ke liye paison ke rishwat di jate he
 Macdonald and Sirianni have used the term 'emotional proletariot', which implies that 'workers are required to show friendship and respect to customers in which they exercise emotional labor'
 sammaan kii vajahase in vyavsaayon mahila rojgaar ke rup main taksaali ho jate hai
 Macdonald and Sirianni claim that, in no other field of wage labor are the personal characteristics of workers so strongly associated with the nature of work
 macdonald or sirianni ke anusaar seva arthvyavastha ke bheetar karyrat sabhi shramikon bhaavnaatmak shram kii maang ke kaaran apni garima or aatm-pahchaan ko banaae rakhana kathin ho saktaa he
 Such an institution can be a crisis especially for women workers
 is tarah muskura rahi he or mitrataa ke sandesh ke rup main seva baatcheet main sakaaratmak bhavatmak pradarshan, sakaaratmak grahako ke sakaaratmak bhaawanaaon ke saath jude huye hai
 It has also been proved that performing emotional labor can also lead to emotional exhaustion of the employee leading to lower employee satisfaction
 anubhavjanya saboot he ki ucch str ke bhaavnaatmak shram maangon ko samaan rup se adhik vetan ke saath puraskrit nahin kar rahe hai
 Rather, the reward is dependent on the level of general cognitive demands required for the job

 The importance of physics is also more because being the birthplace of engineering and crafts science, it is the basic motivator of all social and economic development of this era

 Physics can be broadly divided into two parts
 1900 isvi se purv jo bhautik gyaan arjeet kiya gaya tha or tatsambandhi jo niyam tathaa siddhant pratipaadit kiye gaye the, unka samavesh chirsmmat bhautikee main kiya gaya
 The inspirations of the ideology of that time were Galileo and Newton
 chirsmmat bhautikee ko mukhyat: yantriki, dhvaniki, ooshmaa, vidyutchumbakatv or prakaashiki main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 These branches are the cornerstone of engineering and craft science and elementary education in physics is started from them only
 1900 isvi ke pashchaat anek krantikari tathy gyaat hue, jinako chirasmmati bhautikee ke dhaanche main baithaana kathin he
 The branch of physics that originated in studying these new facts and solving their clues is called modern physics
 aadhunik bhautikee kaa dravyasanrachana se sidhaa sambandh he
 Atomic elements, nuclei and basic particles are their main subjects
 bhautikee kii is naveen shakha ne vaigyanik vichaardhaara ko naveen or krantikari mode diya he tathaa isse samaajik vigyaan or darshanashastra bhi mahatvapurn rup se prabhavit hue hai
 'currently solid state physics is known as modern physics where we reads about construction and energy of material
 There are some other branches but Electronics is the latest

 unke pita kaa naam pradhan thakkar or maan kaa naam rajbai tha
 Bapa's mother was a religious woman, who served the saints and saints a lot
 unki seva se prasann hokar sant raghuveer das ji ne aashirwad diya ki unka dusraa butra jalaaram ishwar tathaa sadhu-bhakthi or seva kii misaal banegaa
 At the age of 16, Shri Jalaram was married to Veerabai

 Since not much material of that period has been preserved, little is known about the Hedian period, but scientists estimate that at about 4
53 Ga, soon after the initial surface was built, a more primitive planet There was an impact on the ancient-earth, which bounced off its cover and a part of the surface into space and the moon was born
 hadian yug ke dauraan, prithvi kii sataha par lagaataar ulkapaat hota rahaa or badi maatra main ooshmaa ke pravaah tathaa bhu-ooshmiya anupaat ke kaaran jwalamukhiyon kaa visphot bhi bhayankar rahaa hoga

 The solar system was formed by a rotating cloud of interstellar dust and gas, called a solar nebula, orbiting the center of the galaxy
 yah big baing 13
7 Ga ke kuch hi samay baad nirmit hydrogen va helium tathaa adhinav taron dwaara utsarjit baari tatwon se milakar bana tha
 At about 4
6 Ga, the solar nebula began to shrink, possibly due to an aggressive wave of a nearby supernova
 sambhav he ki is tarah kii kisi aakraamak tarang ke kaaran hi niharika ke ghoomane va koniya aaveg praapt karne kii shuruyaat hui ho
 Gradually as the cloud increased its rotation speed, due to gravity and inactivity, it transformed into a micro-planetary wheel, which was perpendicular to its axis of rotation
 iskaa adhikansh bhaar iske centre main ekatrit ho gaya or garm hone laga, lekin anya bade avasheshon ke koniya aaveg tathaa takaraav ke kaaran sookshm vyatikramon kaa nirmaan hua, jinhone ek aise madhyam kii rachana kii, jiske dwaara kai kilometre kii lambaai vaale sookshm-grahon kaa nirmaan prarambh hua, jo ki niharika ke centre ke chaaron ore ghoomane lage
 The falling of substances, increasing the speed of rotation and the pressure of gravity created excessive kinetic energy at the center
 kisi anya prakriya ke madhyam se ek aisi gati, jo ki is nirmaan ko mukt kar paane main sakasham ho, par us urja ko kisi anya sthaan par sthanantarit kar paane main isaki aakshamata ke parinamswaroop chakri kaa centre garm hone laga
 Ultimately the nuclear melting of hydrogen into helium began, and eventually, after contraction, the burning of a t Tauri star created the Sun
 isi bich, gurutvkarshan ke kaaran jab padaarth naye surya kii gurutvkarshan simaaon ke baahar purv main baadhit vastuon ke chaaron ore ghaneebhoot hone laga, to dhul ke kan or shesh sookshm-grahiy chakri chhallon main pruthak hona shuru ho gai
 Over time, large blocks collided with each other and large objects were formed, which eventually became micro-planets
 isamen centre se lagbhag 150 million kilometre kii duuri par sthit ek sangrah bhi shaamil tha: prithvi
 is grah kii rachana lagbhag 4
54 billian varsh purv hui or iskaa adhikansh bhaag 10-20 million varshon ke bheetar puraa hua
 The solar wind of the newly formed t Tauri star removed much of the material of the Chakri which was not condensed as large bodies
 computer simmulation yah darshaate hai ki ek sookshm-grahiy chakri se aise parthiv grahon kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he, jinke bich kii duuri hamaare saura-mandal main sthit grahon ke bich kii duuri ke baraabar ho
 According to the widely accepted nebula concept, the process by which the planets of the Solar System arose, the same process produces growth circles around all the new stars that form in the universe, some of which are stars from the planets
 Is constructed
 puraatan-prithvi kaa vikaas abhivruddhi se tab tak hota rahaa, jab tak ki sookshm-grah kaa aantarik bhaag paryaapt rup se itnaa garm nahin ho gaya ki baari, louh-dhaatuon ko pighla sake
 Fluid metals, whose density was now higher, began to accumulate at the center of the Earth's mass
 is tathakthith louh pralay ke parinamswaroop ek puraatan aavaran tathaa ek centre prithvi ke nirmaan ke keval 10 million varshon main hi pruthak ho gayi, jisase prithvi kii stareey sanrachana bani or prithvi ke chumbakeey kshetra kaa nirmaan hua
 During the accumulation of material on the primitive planet, a cloud of gaseous silica must have surrounded the Earth, which later condensed into its surface as solid rocks
 ab is grah ke aas-paas saura-niharika ke prakaashiya tatwon, jinamein se adhikansh hydrogen va helium se bane the, kaa ek praarambhik vaataavaran shesh rah gaya, lekin saura-vaayu tathaa prithvi kii ushma ne is vaataavaran ko dur hataa diya hoga
 When the current radius of the Earth increased by about 40%, it changed and gravity held the atmosphere, including water
 prithvi kaa apekshaakrit bada prakritik upgrah, chandramaa, adwitiya he
 During the Apollo program, rock fragments were brought from the lunar surface to Earth
 in chattaanon kii radiometric dating se yah pataa chalaa he ki chandramaa kii aayu 4527 ± 10 million varsh he, jo ki saura mandal ke anya pindon se lagbhag 30 se 55 million varsh kam he
 Also said, it must have been slightly smaller in size than the current Mars
 sambhav he ki uskaa nirmaan surya va prithvi se 150 million kilometre dur, unke chauthe yaa paanchave lagrengian bindu par padaarth ke sanchayan ke dwaara hua ho
 Initially her orbit would have been stable, but when Theia's weight started increasing due to the accumulation of matter, she would have become unbalanced
 lagrengian bindu ke chaaron ore theia kii ghurnan-kaksha badhati gai or antat lagbhag 4
533 Ga main vah prithvi se takaraa gaya
 The models show that when a colliding planet of this size collided with ancient Earth at a low angle and at a relatively slow rate, most of the material emanating from the inner layer and outer cover of the primitive-earth and dominant planet bounced into space, where Most of it remained in orbit around the Earth
 antat isi padaarth ne chandramaa kii rachana kii
 However, the metallic-like elements of the planetary planet combined with the Earth's element went below its surface, leaving the Moon deprived of metal-like elements
 is prakaar vishaal sanghaat avadharana chandramaa kii asaamaanya sanrachana ko spasht karti he
 It is possible that the material emitted in orbit around the earth has become condensed as a body within two weeks
 apane swayan ke gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav main, yah utsarjit padaarth ek adhik vrittakar pind main badal gaya: chandramaa
 Radiometric calculations show that Earth existed at least 10 million years before this impact, which is a sufficient period for the differentiation between the Earth's initial mantle and the inner layer
 iske baad, jab sanghaat hua, to keval upree aavaran ke padaarth kaa hi utsarjan hua, tathaa prithvi ke aantarik aavaran main sthit baari siderophile tatv isse achoote hi rahe
 Some consequences of this impact were very important for the young Earth
 isse urja kii ek badi maatra nikali, jisase prithvi va chandramaa donon hi puri tarah pigal gaye
 Soon after this impact, the Earth's mantle was highly conductive, its surface turning into a large ocean of magma
 is sanghaat ke kaaran grah kaa pehla vaataavaran avashya hi puri tarah nasht ho gaya hoga
 It is also believed that due to this impact the Earth's axis also changed and it produced an axial tilt of 23
5 °, which is responsible for the change of weather on the Earth
 It would have also increased the speed of the Earth's rotation
 chunki vishaal sanghaat ke turant baad prithvi vaataavaran-viheen ho gai thi, atah yah sheeghra thandi hui hogi
 Within 150 million years, a solid surface composed of basalt must have been formed
 vartmaan main maujuud felsik mahadwipiya parat tab tak astitv main nahin ai thi
 Within the Earth, further differentiation could only begin when the upper layer had become at least partially solidified
 iske baavjood, praarambhik archian main upree sataha vartmaan kii tulana main bahut adhik garm, sambhawatah 1600 °C ke lagbhag, thi
 This upper layer emitted steam and emitted more gases from volcanoes, completing the creation of another atmosphere
 ulka ke takaraavon ke kaaran atirikt pani aayaat hua, sambhawatah brihaspati ke gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ke antargat aane vaale kshudragrahon kii bahari pattee se utsarjit kshudragrahon se
 Such voluminous events and dissolution of gases could never create such a large amount of water on the earth
 aisa mana jaataa he ki takaraane vaale dhoomaketuon main barf thi, jinase jal praapt hua
 : 130–132 Although most comets are currently far away from the Sun to Neptune in orbit, computer simulations show that they were originally more common in the interior of the solar system

 Since the sun's production was only 70% of the current volume, it is most likely that large amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere prevented the surface water from freezing
 The free oxygen must have been bound to the surface with hydrogen or minerals

 There are two theories about the origin of life
 ek yah suzav detii he ki jaivik ghatak antariksh se prithvi par aae, jabaki duusari kaa tark he ki unki utpatti prithvi par hi hui
 Despite this, both theories suggest a similar approach to how life originally originated
 yadi jivan kii utpatti prithvi par hui thi, to is ghatana kaa samay atyadhik kalpana aadhaarit he-sambhawatah isaki utpatti 4 Ga ke lagbhag hui
 It is possible that life may have arisen and destroyed more than once due to the continuous formation and destruction of the oceans during the same period by the bombardment of high-energy asteroids

 When the choice of raw materials was exhausted, the breeds could use different substances, or possibly stunt their resources and become more widespread, preventing the development of other breeds

 One of the older theories, the theory that has been worked on in some detail, will serve as an example of how this would have happened

 In any case, at some point DNA took over the task of replicator; All known organisms use DNA as their replicator in a nearly identical manner
 aadhunik jivan kaa pratilipikaarak padaarth ek koshikeey jhilli ke bheetar rakhaa hota he
 It is easier to understand the origin of the cellular membrane than the origin of the replicator because a cellular membrane is composed of phospholipid molecules, which when placed in water, often immediately form two layers

:40 The prevailing theory is that the membrane was formed after the replicator, which by then was probably the RNA concept with its replicative material and other biological molecules
 The initial protocell would probably have exploded if it had grown too much; The dispersed material may have reassembled as "bubbles"
 protein, jo ki jhilli ko sthirataa pradaan karte the, yaa jo baad main saamaanya vibhaajan main sahaayta karte the, ne un koshika rekhaon ke prasaran ko protsaahit kiya hoga
 RNA can be an early replicator because it can perform both the task of storing genetic information and catalyzing reactions

 The glacial deposits found on all cratons indicate that around 2

 According to some scientists, this and subsequent Proterozoic ice ages were so severe that the planet was completely frozen from the poles to the equinoxes, a concept called Snowball Earth

 In addition to the well-established endosymbiotic theory of the cellular origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts, it has been suggested that cells have produced peroxisomes, spirochetes have formed cilia and flagella, and perhaps a DNA virus has developed cell nuclei
 However none of these theories are widely accepted
