 But by then the circumstances of England had also changed
 samaajawaadee vichaardhaara teji se apni pakad bana rahi thi
 Intellectuals such as William Thomson were inventing new interpretations of democratic socialism
 sahakaarita par nae prayogon kaa silsilaa prarambh ho chukaa tha
 Workers' organizations were being formed
 samaajawaadee vichaadhara ko aadhaar maanakar nae-nae ubhare chartist andolankaaree sangharsh ke raste satta kii seedhiyaan chadhane kaa man bana chuke the
 He made three big strikes one after the other and made the government difficult
 jisase unhen lag rahaa tha ki ve sheeghra hi satta par savaar hokar bahut aasaani se badlaav ke lakshya ko praapt kar sakenge
 The settlements settled by Owen continued to expire
 dhyatavya he ki oven dwaara aadarshonmukhi samaaj kii yah sankalpana nai yaa anokhi nahin thi
 Nor was he the only intellectual-thinker who dreamed like that
 balki is tarah kii aadarshonmukhi samaaj kii sankalpana usase kareeb saadhe baaise sau varsh pehle plato bhi kar chukaa tha
 John Calvin, Thomas Moore, Rousseau, etc
 also made some similar sage concepts regarding ideal society
 oven yadi apane purvavarti vichaarkon se hatakar or badhkar tha to is kaaran ki vah kora siddhantkaar nahin tha, balki vichaaron ko moort rup dene vaala sachcha evam sankalpadharmee insaan tha
 In this way he was also fundamental in some cases
 usne na keval vargaheen or samanta par aadhaarit samaaj kaa sapana dekha, saath hi apane lakshya kii prapti ke liye usne anek safal prayog bhi kiye the
 It is a different thing that the success he got in the reform programs started decreasing later
 kyonki jis samaaj kaa sapana oven kii ankhon main bastaa tha, tatkaaleen paristhitiyaan uske vipareet thim
 Despite this, it is difficult to ignore Owen's successes
 oven poonjivadi arthvyavastha kaa virdohi tha
 Owen's experiment was ridiculed
 use ardhvikshipt or sanakee kahkar uphaas kaa paatr banaaya gaya
 Owen, however, is considered a supporter of socialism
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki samaajawaadee ;vabapansapereddh shabd kaa pehla prayog usee ne kiya tha
 But Marxist thinkers view Owen's campaign with suspicion
 swayan fradrik anglas ne oven kii niyat par andeh karte hue use ek tarah se chhadam samaajawaadee sweekaar kiya he
 According to the Angles- pramaan ke liye anglas ne ek oven kii ek ukti kaa ullekh apane lekh main kiya he, jisase oven kaa dambh jhalkata he
 Owen wisely, it was said that he had given some facilities to the laborers, while introducing professional skills
 use badale main jo prapti hui, vah kiye gaye kharch se kai guna thi
 Taking this example from Owen's literature, Fredrik Angles explains that- dar ek nakaaratmak bhaavana he
 Fear is such an emotion pre-programmed in all animals and people as an innate instinct response to potential danger
 yah bhaavana hameshaa anukuli nahin he
 This is not a good feeling; There is no freedom, happiness
 yah kai roopon main prakat hota he
 The most common expression is anger
 aapkaa jivan dar ke jeet ke liye ek sangharsh he
 Unlike fear, there is awareness of unity
 dar ke sabase shaktishaalee janarator mrityu kii avadharana he
 The fear we all feel at one time
 yah bacchon ke rup main sabase pehle anubhav kiya jaataa he
 Most people find fear an unpleasant emotion
 khatre kii upasthiti yaa nearesthata kii vajah se ek bahut apriy bhaavana ko dar kehte hai
 Fear, experienced by the human species, is a completely unavoidable emotion
 bhay kii had or seemaa vyakti se duusare vyakti main badalata he, lekin bhaavana ek hi he
 It is caused by anticipation
 dar main kuch aam chehre ke bhav -- daraa hua cheharaa, badi ankhen, khulaa munh aadi
 There are three different types of fear: superstitious, intelligent, and uncertain
 andhvishwasi dar kaalpanik chizon kaa ek bhay he
 The intelligent fear becomes greater and greater knowledge of its world comes as a benefit
 anischitata ke dar se ek ke karrwai ke parinaam kaa naa pataa chalanaa hota he
 Fear is the presence of a dangerous stimulus, or an emotional state in anticipation
 kuch bhay condishning prakriya ke madhyam se hasil kiya jaataa he
 Some are learned through imitation of fear of parents and brother
 insaanon evam jaanwaron main ek asi bhaavana he jo anubhuti dwaara sangraahak hoti he
 When fear for objects or events becomes irrational, it is called "phobia"
 dar insaanon main tab dekha jaataa he jab unhen kisi vastu se kisi prakaar kaa jokhim mahasoos hota ho
 This risk can be of any type - health, money, personal security, etc
 dar shabd "phir" se utpann hua jiskaa arth he aapadaa yaa khatra
 There are ten types of fear in America - terrorist attacks, spiders, death, failure, war or criminal situations, loneliness, future or nuclear war etc
 surveykshan ke anusaar yah kuch aam prakaar ke dar hai-- rakshas or bhoot, buree shaktiyon kaa astitv, tilchatte, makadiyaan, saanp, hits, pani, sooyee, saamaajik asweekruti, pariksha or saarvajanik bol aadi
 a person with arachnophobia feels a stir around the spiders knowing that she will not cause any harm
 kabhi kabhi to vah vastu jo makadi ke samaan dikhti ho, yah vyakti us se bhi dar mahasoos karegaa; is bhay ko atomatonophobia kehete hai
 Another common fear is the fear of pain
 maut ke prati chintaa bahuaiami he; yah ek kii apni mrityu se sambandhit ashankaon kaa parinaam hota he
 Unknown or irrational fear arises from anxiety, which is caused by negative thinking
 bahut se log "agyaat" se darate hai
 Experts in these cases have given false testimony as a definition that seems to be true; This scale is used
 yah ek vyakti main aalasy or shithilataa paidaa kar saktaa he
 In some people, fear develops through learning
 yah dar condishning ke rup main manovigyaan main padhaa jaataa he
 Fear can be learned from experiencing or seeing a traumatic accident
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek baccha ek kuen main gir jaataa he or baahar nikalne ke liye sangharsh karata he, to usamen kuon ke dar kaa vikaas ho saktaa he
 This shows that fear can develop not only through learning but also through personal history
 dar saanskrithik or aitihaasik sandarbh se bhi prabhavit hota he
 For example, in the 20th century, many Americans feared polio
 logon kii bhay ke prati pratikriya lagaataar paar saanskrithik matbhedon se utpann hoti hai
 Despite this, fear is learned, the ability to fear is part of human nature
 kai adhyayanon se yah pataa chalaa he ki kuch dar dusron kii tulana main aam he
 This phenomenon is known as preparedness
 dar chintaa, bhay, aatank or dehshat ke rup main badhate str par vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Fear starts with a seductive reaction
 bhay kai avchetan vyavhaar ko rasta detaa he
 Fear generates a series of biological events in the body
 dar turant kaary karata he
 Many physical changes are associated with fear in the body
 khatre kaa muqabla karne ke liye ek sahaj pratikriya in lakshan dwaara dekhi jaati he-- saans lene kii dar main teji, hriday gati, paridhiy rakt vahikaaon kaa kasnaa, mansapeshiyon main tanaav, pasinaa, badhata rakt glucose,safed rakt koshikaon main vruddhi or sone main ashaanti
 The fear of the end and its existence is in other words the fear of death
 is bhay ki vajah se log ek duusare ke saath milakar kathinaayeeyon kaa saamana karte hai naa ki akele
 Religions have existed in different forms of fear in human life for centuries
 yah dar naitik he
 Death is seen as a frontier for another world
 dar ek santanochit yaa ek slav junun ko vyakt karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Fear can be politically and culturally manipulated
 bhay or buraai hameshaa se hi ek duusare se sambandhit the
 a drug treatment for fear conditioning and phobia through the amygdala is the use of glucocorticoid
 apni suvidha kshetra main hameshaa rahanaa sabase acha tarika nahin he
 Work on becoming comfortable by stepping outside your comfort zone
 dhyaan aapako shant karata he or aapako kisi bhi sthiti kaa saamana karne ke liye aantarik shakti detaa he
 Meditation helps reduce your anxiety
 hamaari sabase buree kalpana evam chintaa tab hoti he jab ham dar se apane dimag main ghire hue hon
 The best way to avoid fear is to have a little control over our imagination
 ham main se kai logon ko dar pasand nahin he kyonki dar hamen pangu bana detaa he
 But if you just allow yourself to feel fear, then you will see for yourself that the situation is manageable

 Electronics is the department of science in which electric power is efficiently converted to the desired voltage, frequency, current by using electron tubes or semiconductor devices performing similar functions
 vastav main baat yah he ki vidyut shakti hame jis rup main main praapt hoti he usee rup main vah bahut kam upyog main laayi jaati he
 For example, an industry receives electric power in the form of 415 volts, 50 Hz AC
 use vidyutlepan karnaa he jiske liye 0 se 20 volt disi chaiye jisamen se shunya se lekar 1200 ampir dhara bahegi
 It is clear that the power we are getting cannot be directly used for this work, rather it will have to be changed
 yah kaam shakti electraniki dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In fact, there are thousands of examples where electric power cannot be used as it is, rather it has to be changed to some other form
 electraneey yuktiyon main se mahatvapurn upyog ye hai : Many of today's most modern devices also cannot be made without electronics, such as radio, television, movies, fluorescence light, public lecture-system, telephone etc

 Forests, habitats for animals, affect the water cycle and are useful for soil conservation, hence it is called an important part of the Earth's biosphere
 van dharti ke sabase pramukh sthaliy paaritantr hai
 The fauna of the forest house is responsible for 75% of the total gross primary product of the system and 80% of the earth's vegetation is found in the forests
 Forests at different heights form different ecosystems
 Such as the boreal forest near the poles, tropical forest near the equator and temperate forest at moderate heights
 The height of an area and the moisture present there affect the trees found in that area
 Humans and forests have both positive and negative effects on each other
 Forests provide resources to humans and also provide sources of earning
 Forests also affect the health of humans
 While there is a negative impact on the forest due to human intervention

 kaaman getwe interphes CGI ek bahari aplicoshan software kaa soochna dene vaale sarwar ke saath sampark saadhane ke liye ek maanak protocol he, jo ki aamtaur par ek web sarwar hota he
 The function of this informing server is to respond to the request by output / result
 har baar ek anurodh praapt hone par, sarwar anurodh kaa vishleshan karata he or uchit uttar detaa he
 The following two basic methods are used by the server to do this: CGI duusare tareeke ko karne kaa maanak dhang paribhaashit karata he
 It defines how information and requests about the server are sent as variables according to logic and status, and how additional information can be sent as a command header
 1993 main world wide web simit, kintu teji se bad rahaa tha
 WWW software developers and web site developers kept in touch with each other via the www-talk mailing list, so a standard of running the command line to communicate was thus agreed upon
 CGI vivarani main vishesh rup se varnit yogadanakarta nimnlikhit hai: Rob mccool drafted the initial features and the NCSA still hosts it
 yah bahut se sarvaron main teji se lagu kiya gaya tha
 An example of a CGI program is to implement a wiki
 yuzar agent ek pravishti ke naam kaa anurodh karata he; sarwar pravishti ke prishth se uskaa strot praapt karegaa, ise HTML main badalegaa or parinaam bhejega
 From a web server's point of view, some locators, such as http: / / www
example
com / wiki
cgi, are defined to be run by CGI in a program
 jab URL ke liye anurodh praapt hota he to is se sambandhit kaarykram chalaaya jaataa he
 The data is inserted into the program using the variable according to the situation
 yah vishisht chaalan ke vipareet he, jahaan cmand line tark prayog kiye jate hai
 In the case of HTTP PUT or POST, the data entered by the user is made available to the program through standard input
 web sarwar main diarectory tree ke aadhaar par ek cgi-bin diarectory hoti he jo CGI dwaara maangi jane vaali chalaane yogya filon kaa sangrahan rakhti he
 The program sends the result as a standard reply to the web server, which initially consists of a header and a blank line
 hader usee tarah se kutabaddh hota he jaise ek HTTP hader or isamen bheje gayi dastauez kaa MIME prakaar bhi shaamil hona chahie
 Headers are usually forwarded to the user with the result, which is provided by the web server
 yadi kisi maamle main CGI kol main scrypting bhashaa prayukt hoti he jaise ki csh yaa parl, to koding trutiyon ke parinamswaroop code injection jokhim kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Command calling usually means invoking a newly created process
 In starting the process, more time and memory can be spent than the actual work of generating the results, especially when the program is yet to be interpreted or compiled
 yadi program ko aksar chalaaya jaataa he to kaam ke boj se web sarwar jaldi nasht ho sakate hai
 However, this burden can be reduced by using compiled CGI programs such as c / c ++, instead of Perl or other scripting languages with CGI
 pradarshan se sambandhit aise mudde aam taur par keval un mashiinon par ek chintaa kaa vishay he jin par atyaadhik kaarybhaar hota he
 Several approaches can be adopted to treat this: kisi bhi web aplicoshan ke liye sarvshereshth seoup aplicoshan ke vishisht vivaran, yatayaat kii maatra or lenden kii jatilta par nirbhar karata he, kisi bhi die gayi kaam or samay ke bajet kaa kriyanvayan nirdhaarit karne ke liye in vikalpon kaa vishleshan karne kii aavashyaktaa he

 At one time, there was controversy among all the Navagrahas: Sun, Moon, Mars, Buddha, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu, who is the largest among them? Everyone started fighting among themselves, and when no decision was made, Devraj came to Indra to make a decision
 Indra was frightened by this, and expressed his inability to give this decision
 But he said that at this time there is King Vikramaditya on earth, who is very judicious
 ve hi iskaa nirnay kar sakate hai
 All the planets together reached King Vikramaditya, and stated their dispute
 saath hi nirnay ke liye kaha
 The king became very concerned with this problem, because he knew that whoever told him to be small, he would become angry
 Then the king thought of a solution
 He made nine thrones with gold, silver, bronze, brass, lead, ranga, zinc, asbestos and iron, and placed them in the same order
 Then he requested all of you to take a position on your throne
 jo antim singhaasana par bethegaa, vahi sabase chota hoga
 According to this, due to the Iron Throne being the earliest, Shani Dev sat in the latter
 So they are called the youngest
 They thought that the king had done this on purpose
 unhone kupit ho kar raja se kaha “raja! tu mujhe nahin jaanata
 surya ek raashi main ek maheenaa, chandramaa sava do maheenaa do din, mangal ded maheenaa, brihaspati teraa maheene, va buddha or shukr ek ek maheene vicharan karte hai
 parantu main dhai se saadhe-saat saal tak rahata hun

ab tum saavdhaan rahanaa
 ” aisa kahkar kupit hote hue shanidev vahaan se chale gayi
 anya devtaa khushi khushi chale gayi
 After some time the king's half-and-half came
 tab shani dev ghodon ke saudagar banakar vahaan aaye
 He had many fine horses with him
 raja ne yah samachar sun apane ashwapal ko achche ghode kharidne kii ajna di
 He bought many good horses and gave one of the best horses to the king for a ride
 raja jyon hi usapar baitha, vah ghoda sarapat van kii ore bhaaga
 bhishan van main pahunch vah antardhan ho gaya, or raja bhookha pyaasa bhatakta rahaa
 Then a cowboy made him drink water
 The king was pleased and gave him his ring
 vah anguthi dekar raja nagar ko chal diya, or vahaan apana naam ujjain nivasee vikaa bataaya
 He drank water etc
 in a Seth shop there
 And took some rest
 bhagyavash us din seth kii badi bikri hui
 Seth was happy to get him food etc
 and took him home with him
 vahaan usne ek khunti par dekha, ki ek haar tanga he, jise khunti nigal rahi he
 The whole necklace was missing in a while
 tab seth ne aane par dekha ki haar gaayab he
 He understood that Vika had stolen him
 usne vikaa ko kotwaal ke paas pakadava diya
 Then the king also got him a thief and got his hands and feet chopped off
 vah chaurangiya ban gaya
 And was thrown out of the city
 vahaan se ek taili nikal rahaa tha, jise dayaa aayi, or usne vikaa ko apni gadee main bitha liya
 He started stalking the bulls with his tongue
 us kaal raja kii shani dasha samaapt ho gayi
 When the rainy season came, he started singing Malhar
 tab vah jis nagar main tha, vahaan kii rajkumaari manabhaavani ko vah itnaa bhaayaa, ki usne man hi man pran kar liya, ki vah us raag gane vaale se hi vivaah karegi
 He sent Maid to search
 daasi ne bataaya ki vah ek chaurangiya he
 But the princess did not listen
 agle hi din se uthte hi vah anshan par baith gayi, ki vivaah karegi to usee se
 When she did not agree to explain it to him, the king sent that oil, and asked him to prepare for the marriage
 phir uskaa vivaah rajkumaari se ho gaya
 Then one day in a sleeping dream, Shanidev said to the king: Rajan, you have seen how much suffering i have suffered by telling me a little
 tab raja ne unase kshamaa maangi, or prarthana kii, ki he shanidev jaisaa dukh mujhe diya he, kisi or ko naa den
 Shanidev agreed, and said: Whoever will tell my story and fast, will not feel any sorrow in my condition
 jo nity meraa dhyaan karegaa, or chintiyon ko aataa daalega, uske saare manorath purna honge
 At the same time, he gave back his hands and feet to the king
 praatah aankh khulne par rajkumaari ne dekha, to vah aashcharyachakit rah gayi
 Vika tells him that he is King Vikramaditya of Ujjain
 sabhi atyant prasann hue
 When Seth heard it, he fell on his feet and started apologizing
 raja ne kaha, ki vah to shanidev kaa coup tha
 There is no fault of anyone in this
 seth ne phir bhi nivedan kiya, ki mujhe shanti tab hi milegi jab aap mere ghar chalakar bhojan karenge
 Seth welcomed the king with a variety of dishes at his home
 saath hi sabane dekha, ki jo khunti haar nigal gayi thi, vahi ab use ugal rahi thi
 Seth thanked the king by giving many pieces, and got his eclipse from his daughter Shrikavari
 raja ne saharsha sweekaar kar liya
 After some time, the king took his two queens, Manabhavani and Shrikavani with all dowries and proceeded to Ujjain city
 vahaan puravaasiyon ne seemaa par hi unka swaagat kiya
 Deepmala took place all over the city, and everyone celebrated
 raja ne ghoshnaa kii, ki maine shani dev ko sabase chota bataaya tha, jabaki asal main vahi sarvopari hai
 Since then, the worship and story of Shani Dev began to be regularized throughout the state
 sari praja ne bahut samay khushi or anand ke saath bitaaya
 Whoever hears or reads this story of Shani Dev, all his sorrows disappear

 painic atake, teevr bhay yaa ghabdaahat ke dauron ko kehete hai jo achaanak paidaa hote hai or apekshaakrit choti avadhi ke hote hai
 Panic attacks usually start suddenly, reach peak levels within 10 minutes, and end predominantly within 30 minutes of DSM-IV
 ghabdaahat ke daure 15 second kii alpavadhi se lekar kabhi-kabhi ghanton tak jari rahane vaale yaa aavarti bhi ho sakate hai
 According to the American Psychological Association, in situations where seizures have previously occurred, afflicted individuals often experience severe anticipatory fear and limited symptomatic seizures between visits
 ghabdaahat ke dauron ke prabhaavon main bhinnata hoti he
 Some, especially first-time victims, may require emergency services
 ghabdaahat ke daure kaa anubhav karne vaale kai logon ko, zyaadaatar pehali baar ke daure main dil ke daure yaa tantrika avrodh kaa dar laga rahata he
 The experience of panic attacks is said to be one of the most frightening, annoying and uncomfortable experiences of a person's life
 ghabdaahat ke dauron kaa anubhav karne vaale aksar ek tarah ke dar yaa marane kii anubhuti, "pagal ho jane" yaa dil ke daure yaa "chamak purna drushti" kaa anubhav karte hai yaa unhen behoshee yaa michali grast hone kii anubhuti hoti he, puure sharir main ek sunnata kaa anubhav ho saktaa he, saans kii takalif yaa apane upar niyantran khone jaisaa mahasoos ho saktaa he
 Some people also experience tunnel vision which is mostly due to the defensive side being towards more important parts of the body rather than the blood flow being towards the head
 is tarah ke anubhav us sthaan ko chhodkar chale jane yaa bhaag jane kii teevr ichha ko badha sakati he jahaan daura shuru hua tha jisamen is pratikriya kaa kaaran banane vaala hormone kaaphi maatra main nikalne lagata he
 This reaction typically fills the body with epinephrine hormones that help protect against damage
 ghabdaahat kaa daura ek samvedansheel tantrika tantra kii pratikriya hoti he
 The most common symptoms are tremor, dyspnea, cardiac tremor, chest pain, hot flashes, cold flashes, burning sensation, sweating, nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, rapid breathing, aphasia, breathlessness, or pain
 Weakness and understanding of the knee may include weakening
 ghabdaahat ke dauron se grast vyakti main in shaareerik lakshanon ko chetavanee ke rup main samajha jaataa he
 This results in increased anxiety and lacks a positive response
 saanse choti hona or seene main dard kaa anubhav hona aksar iske pramukh lakshan hai; peedit vyakti ise galat tareeke se dil ke daure ke sanket yaa lakshan samaj lete he
 Because of this, a person experiencing panic attacks needs treatment in an emergency room
 ghabdaahat ke dauron ko unki tivrata or unki achaanak, shrinkhalabaddh prakruti ke aadhaar par vyagrata ke anya swaroopon se alag kiya ja saktaa he
 They are often experienced jointly with anxiety disorders and other psychiatric conditions, although panic attacks are generally not a sign of mental disorder
 esaesarai varg ke lagbhag sabhi avsaadarodhi, upyog kii shuruyaat main vyagrata ko badhaane kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 It is not uncommon for inexperienced users, especially those who are sensitive to anxiety, to have panic attacks in order to take and drop medications
 hriday sambandhi samasya vaale kisi vyakti ke liye hriday rog or vyagrata ke lakshanon ke bich fark kar paanaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 In CPVT, anxiety itself can and does trigger arrhythmias
 aisa prathit hota he ki hriday sambandhi samasyaon kii dwitiyak sthiti main ghabdaahat ke dauron kaa vartmaan prabandhan benzodigepins; chuninda serotonin riapatek inhibitor or / yaa sangyanatmak vyavhaar janya upachaar par bahut adhik bharosa karata he
 However, people in this group often have to be hospitalized multiple times and compulsorily; Without an electrocardiogram in people with such symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish between symptoms of cardiac problems in front of symptoms of panic attacks
 haalanki ghabdaahat ke dauron ke kai lakshan peedit vyakti ko yah anubhav de sakate hai ki uskaa sharir naakaam ho rahaa he, vastav main yah apane aapako nuksaan se bachaa rahaa hota he
 Many symptoms of panic attacks can be understood as follows
 sabase pehla, isamen aksar thodi uttejk prerana ke saath dar kii achaanak shuruyaat hoti he
 It causes the secretion of adrenalin which leads to a so-called fight-or-flight ie fight or run response in which the person's body is prepared for rigorous physical activity
 isse hriday gati bad jaati he, saansen tej ho jaati hai jise choti-choti sanson ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he or pasinaa nikalataa he 
 kyonki kathor shaareerik gatividhi shaayad hi kabhi kaam karti he, hyper ventilation ke kaaran fefdon main or uske baad rakt main carbon dioxide ke str main giravat aa jaati he
 This changes the amount of ph in the blood, which in turn can cause many other symptoms such as tremors or numbness, dizziness, burning sensation, and dizziness in the head
 In addition, the adrenalin secretion during panic attacks causes vasoconstriction, which results in slightly reduced blood flow to the head, causing dizziness and lightheadedness
 ek ghabdaahat kaa daura rakt sharkara ko mastishk se dur or pramukh mansapeshiyon kii ore le jane kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 This is also possible in the case of seizures where the person feels unable to control his breath and they start taking deep breaths which also works to reduce the level of carbon dioxide in the blood
 painic atake ke liye dsam-iv naidanik maandand a discrete period of extreme fear or discomfort in which four of the following symptoms develop suddenly and reach their peak within 10 minutes: agoraphobia ek vyagrata sambandhi vikaar he jo praarambhik rup se peedit vyakti dwaara ek aisi mushkil yaa sharmnaak paristhiti kaa saamana karne ke bhay se paidaa hota he jisase uskaa batch paanaa sambhav nahin he
 Panic attacks are usually associated with agoraphobia and being unable to survive a bad situation
 iske parinaam swaroop agoraphobia se gambhir rup se peedit vyakti apane gharon main simit ho jate hai or is "surakshit sthaan" se nikaalkar safar kar paane main kathinaayee kaa anubhav karte hai
 The term "agoraphobia" is an English adaptation of the Greek words agora and phobos
 "agora" shabd kaa matlab he vah sthaan jahaan pracheen unani log ek jagah jamaa hote the or shahar ke muddon par charchaa karte the, isliye yah mul rup se kisi yaa sabhi saarvajanik sthalon par lagu hota he; haalanki agoraphobia kaa mul bhav ghabdaahat ke dauron kaa ek dar he visheshkar jab ye logon ke bich utpann hote hai jisase peedit ko yah mahasoos ho saktaa he ki uske paas batch nikalne kaa koi rasta nahin he
 In the case of agoraphobia caused by social phobia or social anxiety, the victim may be very nervous about experiencing panic attacks for the first time in public
 yah anuwaad is aam galatfahami kaa kaaran he ki agoraphobia khule sthanon kaa dar he or yah naidanik rup se sahi nahin he
 Agarophobia, described in this manner, is actually a symptomatic professional examination when diagnosing panic disorder
 anya lakshan jaise ki jununee badhyakaari vikaar yaa yantranaa pashchaat kaa tanaav bhi agoraphobia ke kaaran ban sakate hai, mul rup se aisa koi bhi niraadhaar bhay jo vyakti ko baahar jane se roktaa he, is syndrome kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 People who have panic attacks in certain situations may develop unfounded fears called phobias of these conditions and start avoiding them
 antat ek or daure ke bare main chintaa kaa str or bachane kii pravriti us sthiti tak pahunch sakati he jahaan ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaar vaale vyakti vaahan chalaane main yaa ghar se baahar nikalne main aksham hote hai
 In this state, the person is said to have panic disorder with agoraphobia
 yah ghabdaahat ke daure kaa ek sabase hanikaarak dushprabhav ho saktaa he kyonki yah peedit vyakti ko pehali sthiti main upachaar kii maang karne se roak saktaa he
 It should be noted that over 90% of agoraphobic individuals recover completely
 jin logon ko baar-baar, lagaataar daure padate hai yaa jo ek or daura padane ke bare main gambhir vyagrata mahasoos karte hai, unhen kathith rup se ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaar hota he
 Panic disorders are quite different from other types of anxiety disorders due to panic attacks often occurring suddenly and without reason
 ghabdaahat ke dauron kaa manovaigyanik therapy or dawaaon sahit vibhinn hastkshepon ke jariye prabhavi dhang se ilaaj kiya saktaa he jiskaa pramaan yah he ki sangyanatmak vyavhaar kii therapy kaa prabhaav lambe samay tak rahata he jiske baad vishisht chuninda seretonin riapatek inhibitaron kaa number aata he
 According to the American Psychological Association, "most experts agree that a combined use of cognitive and behavioral therapy is the best treatment for panic disorders
 kuch maamalon main dawaaen bhi upyukt sabit ho sakati hai
 "the first part of the treatment is largely information-based; many people have benefited greatly by simply understanding what panic disorder actually is and how many other people suffer from it
 kai log hai jo ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaron se grast hote hai ve is baat se chintit rahete hai ki ghabdaahat ke dauron kaa matlab unke "paagalpan" se he yaa yah ki is ghabdaahat se dil ke daure pad sakate hai
 'cognitive restructuring' helps people see visits in a much more realistic, positive way than those ideas
 ghabdaahat ke dauron se grast kai log or chikitsak, teevr ghabdaahat ke dauron ke kargar alpakaalik upachaar ke rup main ek paper bag main saans lene kii salaah dete hai
 Although others have criticized this treatment as ineffective and possibly harmful to the patient, even possibly making panic attacks more dangerous
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki yah takanic rakt pravaah main oxigen ke str ko ghaatak rup se kam kar sakati he or carbon diaoxide ke staron ko badha sakati he jise badale main ghabdaahat ke dauron ke ek pramukh kaaran ke rup main paaya gaya he
 It is therefore important to ascertain whether hyperventilation is actually present in each case
 agar aisa he to rakt main oxigen / CO2 kii maatra ko santulit karnaa or / yaa ek samaan shwasan sambandhi pattern ko punah sthapit karnaa ek upyukt upachaar ho saktaa he jise ginati karke yaa kuch gunaguna kar bahari saans ke vistaar ke jariye bhi hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 a recent study suggests that menopausal women experiencing panic disorder and multiple panic attacks have a three-fold increased risk of heart attack or stroke in the next five years
 shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki ghabdaahat ke dauron yaa kahin adhik sateekta se unase jude lakshan anupachaarit hridayavahini sambandhi vikaron ke swarup ho sakate hai yaa iske parinaam swaroop ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaron vaale marijon main hridayavahini sambandhi tanaav ke kaaran or kai varshon kii avadhi main kai ghabdaahat ke dauron kii sthiti main hriday ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 However, the study did not find that individual cases of panic attacks without panic disorder or agoraphobia could cause immediate heart damage, nor did it prove that the relationship between panic disorder and stroke Was accidental, or could be attributed to the cardiovascular effects of some drugs in patients with multiple panic disorder Security is such that ssris and benzodiazepines
 Symptoms of panic attacks may be hiding heart attack warnings and prior information
 ghabdaahat ke lakshanon or dil kii bimariyon ke lakshanon kii pahchaan ke liye seene main dard, saans kii takalif, asaamaanya thakaan or dil ke daure ke anya lakshanon kii jaanch ek chikitsak dwaara karai jaani chahie
 Many people who are undergoing panic attacks experience limited symptomatic seizures
 is tarah ke ghabdaahat ke daure kam vistrut hote hai, jinamein 4 se bhi kam shaareerik lakshanon kaa anubhav kiya ja saktaa he
 It is not uncommon for people with panic disorders to experience just one or two symptoms at a time, such as tremor in their feet or shortness of breath, or an intense heat wave in their body that leads to estrogen
 Is not the same as hot flashes caused by a lack of
 pairon main kampan jaise kuch lakshan kisi bhi saamaanya anubhuti se kaaphi alag nahin hote hai jiske ki ye spasht rup se ghabdaahat ke daure kaa sanket de saken
 is suchi ke anya lakshanon ko duusare logon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he, bhale hi ve ghabdaahat sambandhi vikaar se grast hon athwa nahin
 In panic disorder, it is not really necessary that four or more symptoms appear at the same time
 purnataya niraadhaar ghabdaahat or tej hoti dil kii dhadkan jaise lakshan, kaaphi had tak ghabdaahat ke dauron kaa sanket ho sakate hai

 The ozone molecule absorbs UV light between 310 and 200 nm, causing the ozone to split into an oxygen atom and an O2 molecule
 ab oxigen parmaanu oxigen anu ke saath sanyojit hokar fir se ozon anu banaata he
 This is a continuous process that ends when an oxygen atom "recombines" with an ozone molecule to form two O2 molecules
 o + O3 → 2 O2 The total amount of ozone in the stratosphere is determined by a balance between photochemical production and recombination

 All of these have both natural and synthetic sources; at the present time, the majority of OH and NO
 It has a natural origin in the stratosphere, but human activity has resulted in dramatically higher increases in oxygen chlorine and bromine
 cfcl3 + hν → cfcl2 + Cl Now the atoms of chlorine and bromine destroy ozone molecules through several decomposition cycles

 Although the Antarctic ozone hole has little effect in reducing global ozone, it is estimated to be 4% per decade, the hole has generated much interest because: chunki ozon parat surya ke UVB ko avashoshit karti he, atah ozon parat riktikaran sataha UVB ke str main vruddhi kar saktaa he, yah kshati kaa kaaran ho saktaa he yah twachaa cancer kii sambhaavna ko badhaata he
 This was the reason for the Montreal Protocol
 yadhyapi samtap mandal kii ozon main kami siefasi se sambandhit he, ozon main kami satahi UVB main vruddhi karegi is par vishwaas karne ke liye paryaapt kaaran hai, ozon kii kami ko maanav main twachaa cancer ke badhane se sambandhit karne vaale pratyaksh pramaan uplabdh nahin hai
 This is partly due to the fact that UVA is effective in many types of skin cancers, it is not absorbed by ozone, it is impossible to control statistics for lifestyle changes in most populations
 ozon jo prithvi ke vayumandal main ek alpsankhyak ghatak he, UVB vikiran ke adhikansh avasorana ke ke liye jimmedaar he
 The amount of UVB radiation that passes through the ozone layer exponentially decreases with the slope path thickness / density of the layer
 is se sambandhit ek tathy yah bhi he ki vayumandal main ozon main kami sataha ke paas UVB ke str main ullekhneey vruddhi ke liye jimmedaar hogi
 The increase in surface UVB due to the ozone hole can be partially hindered by radiation transfer model calculations
 lekin kyonki vishwasaneey aitihaasik sataha yuvi data main kami ke kaaran ise pratyaksh gananaaon ke dwaara mapa nahin ja saktaa he, yadhyapi adhik haal hi ke avlokan maap kaaryakramon ke udhaaharan upasthit hai
 Because it is the same parabengy radiation that forms O2 to ozone in the ozone layer, the reduction of ozone in the stratosphere increases the photochemical production of ozone at lower levels, although) overall analysis still shows a decrease in the column of ozone
 , Because the ozone produced in the lower levels naturally has a shorter life span, so before it can supply damaged ozone, it Specific cause is
 ozon chhidr ke bare main mukhya saarvajanik chintaa kaa vishay he;maanav swasthya par sataha yuvi kaa prabhaav
 adhiktar sthanon main ab tak, ozon riktikaran kuch hi pratishat he, adhikansh aakshanshon main swasthya kshati ke koi pratyaksh pramaan nahin mili hai
 High levels of depletion in the ozone hole are common worldwide, the effects may be more dramatic
 antarctic par ozon hole kuch udaahranon main itnaa bada ho gaya he ki australia or newjiland, ke dakshini bhaagon tak pahunch gaya he, paryaavaranvaadiyon ke anusaar satahi yu ve main vruddhi mahatvapurn ho sakati he
 UVB is commonly accepted as an adjunct to skin cancer
 iske alaava, satahi yu ve main vruddhi, kshobh mandal kii ozon main vruddhi karti he, jo maanav ke swasthya ke liye jokhim he
 An increase in surface UV represents an increase in the ability of sunlight to synthesize vitamin D
 vitamin di ke cancer nirodhak prabhaav ozon riktikaran ke ek sambhavit laabhadaayak prabhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 In terms of health costs, the potential benefits of increased UV radiation can increase the burden

 aadhari or squamus koshika carcinoma--maanav main twachaa cancer kaa sabase aam rup, aadhari or squamus koshika carcinoma, UVB ke sampark main rahane se sambandhit he
 The mechanism by which UVB inspires these cancers has been well understood; Pyrimidine alkali in the DNA molecule absorbs UVB radiation to form dimers, resulting in errors in replication of DNA
 ye cancer aapekshik rup se saumy hote hai or kabhi kabhi hi ghaatak hote hai, yadhyapi squamus koshika carcinoma ke upachaar ke liye kabhi kabhi vyapak punarnirmaan shalya chikitsa kii zarurat hoti he
 Combining the results of animal studies with epidemiological data, scientists have estimated that it has decreased by one percent
 samtap mandal kii ozon in cancer kii ghatnaon ko 2% badhaaegi

 Malignant melanoma - Another form of skin cancer, malignant melanoma, is less common but more dangerous, being fatal in about 15% - 20% of the cases diagnosed
 ghaatak melanoma or parabangnee kirann ke bich sambandh abhi tak thik prakaar se gyaat nahin he, lekin aisa prathit hota he ki donon UVB or UVA shaamil hai machhlee par prayog darshaate hai ki 90 se 95% ghaatak melanoma UVA or drishy vikiran ke kaaran hote hai
 Whereas experiments on oposum indicate a greater role of UVB
 is anischitata ke kaaran yah anumaan laganaa mushkil he ki melanoma kii ghatana par ozon riktikaran kaa kya prabhaav padataa he
 One study shows that a 10% increase in UVB radiation increases melanoma by 19% in men and 16% in women
 chilike dakshini sheersh panta arenas main logon par kiya gaya ek adhyayan darshata he ki ozon main kami or UVB staron main vruddhi ke saath saat varshon main melanoma main 56% kii vruddhi or gaiyr melanoma twachaa cancer main 46% kii vruddhi hui

 Cortical Cataracts - Studies showing the relationship between ocular cortical cataract and UV-B risk, in which risk is estimated and a variety of cataract estimation techniques are used
 yuvi-b ke ankhon ke sampark main rahane kaa vistrut adhyayan Chesapeake Bay Watermen, main kiya gaya jahaan yah paaya gaya ki netron kaa yu ve bi ke adhik sampark main rahanaa cortical aspashtataa ko badhaata he
 Ex-dominant blond men exposed to Yuv b found that it gave evidence of cortical ambiguity
 tathaapi, biver dame main aabaadi aadhaarit ek adhyayan ke aankadon se dablyu ai yah bataata he ki jokhim purushon tak hi simit ho saktaa he
 In the Beaver Dem study, exposure was lower in women and more in men
 No other relationships were seen
 iske alaava, africa americanyon main aise koi aankde nahin mili jo surya ke prakaash ko motiyobind ke jokhim se jodate hon
yadhyapi vibhinn jaateey samoohon main anya netra rogon kii vyaptta alag alag he or cortical aspashtataa gore logon kii tulana main africa americanyon main adhik pai jaati he

 Increase in ozone in troposphere - Increase in surface UV is the reason for increase of ozone in troposphere
 bhu str kii ozon ko saamanyatya ek swasthya jokhim mana jaataa he, kyonki apane prabal oxicari gun ke kaaran ozon vishakt he
 At this time, ground-level ozone has arisen mainly due to the action of UV radiation on the combustion of gases emitted from vehicles
 you ve vikiran main vruddhi fasalon ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 Many economically important species of plants such as rice depend on indigo green bacteria living in their roots to obtain nitrogen
 nil harith jeevanu para bengani prakaash ke liye samvedi hai or ve iske badhane se prabhavit honge
 Research indicates widespread extinction of the plankton, coincidentally with the nearby super nova 2 million years ago
 jab zarurat se adhik you ve kirane prithvi ko pahunchati hai to plancton ke abhivinyas or gatishiltaa main antar aa jaataa he
 Researchers say the deletion occurred due to the very weakness in the ozone layer, when radiation from Super Nova produced nitrogen oxides that catalyzed ozone destruction, which are biologically important

 The extent to which cfcs have damaged the ozone layer is not known and will not be known for decades
 lekin ozon stambh main kami ko pehle se hi chinhit kiya ja chukaa he
 After a 1976 report, the US National Academy of Sciences concluded that reliable scientific evidence supports the ozone depletion hypothesis, with some countries, such as the United States, Canada, Sweden, and Norway, ending the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans Has started doing
 us samay par yah adhik vyapak vinium niti kii disha main pehle kadam ke rup main mana gaya tha lekin baad ke varshon main, is disha main pragati dhimi ho gai
 This happened due to a combination of political reasons and scientific development
 europea samudaay ne airosol spray main siefasi pratibandh ke prastaavon ko asweekaar kar diya jabaki you es main siefasi kaa upyog prashithan main or circuit bordon kii safai main jari rahaa
 After the US aerosol ban, worldwide CFC production quickly declined, but by 1986 had returned to its 1976 levels
