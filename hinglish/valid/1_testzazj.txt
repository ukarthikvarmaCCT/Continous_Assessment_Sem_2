 The induction motor is a alternating current motor whose angular speed of the rotor is less than the angular speed of the rotational magnetic field produced by the stator winding
 isi kaaran is motor ko 'atulykaalik motor' kaha jaataa he 
 This is called the 'induction motor' because the current is generated by induction in its rotor because the speed of the rotor and rotational magnetic field are different
 yah motor sabase adhik upyog main aata he jiske kaaran ise udyogon kaa workehorse kehete hai
 There is no wear-resistant component so that it can last for many days without repair
 yah kai prakaar kaa hota he- Most motors used in homes for general tasks and low power are single-phase induction motors, also known as fractional horsepower motors
 udhaaharan ke liye pankhons, dhulaai kii mashiinon ke motor aadi
 Reverse current motors also have field coils and armatures similar to direct current motors, but in some different form
 inamen do mukhya bhaag hote hai : ek to stater, jo sthir rahata he or doosraa roter jo ghumta he
 Reverse current motors are also of different types
 sabase-saamaanya prayavarti dhara motor preran motor he, jo preran ke siddhant par kaary karata he
 In induction motors, the stator coiling is associated with the triplet capacitance, causing a rotational magnetic field
 roter ke chaalak aapas main trikleey kundalan ke rup main bhi ho sakate hai, jo donon siron par taanbe ke valay dwaara laghu paripathit hon
 Such a composition is, in effect, like a squirrel's cage
 at: aise motaron ko saamanyat: 'gilahari panjar preran motor', athwa keval 'panjar motor' hi kehete hai
 These motors are very strong in design as well as are simple and cheap
 inaki dakshata bhi usee aakaar ke duusare motaron kii apeksha unchi hoti he
 Hence the use of these motors is often universal
 parantu in motaron kaa prachaalan, ek prakaar se, roter kii banaavat se anusaar nishchit hota he or usamen aavashyaktaa ke anusaar parivartan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Their initial force is very low, which is necessary to insert some resistance in the rotor circuit to improve, but this is not possible due to the formation of stable type
 saath hi sthaayee taur par roter chaalkon kaa pratirodh bhi adhik nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki aisa karne par haani adhik bad jaaegi or motor kii dakshata ghat jaaegi
 In order to achieve more initial, forced bipeder motors are used, which have two toes instead of one

 The synchronous speed ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} of an AC motor is the speed of the rotational magnetic field of its stator
 iskaa maan nimnlikhit sutara se nikaala ja saktaa he- Where f { \ displaystyle f} is the frequency of supply of the motor and p { \ displaystyle p} is the number of magnetic poles, for example, 50 Hz supply and, for a 6-pole three-phase motor, p { \ displaystyle p} = 6 and ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} = 1,000 RPM slip s { \ displaystyle s} ko praayah nimnlikhit prakaar se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he- Where ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} synchronous speed, nr { \ displaystyle n_ {r}} the rotor speed if the rotor is moving at synchronous speed, the value of slip will be zero if the rotor is not moving at all
 The value will be 1
 motor dwaara utpann balaghurna kaa maan uske roter kii slip par nirbhar karata he
 Which is called 'slip-torque specification'
 spasht he ki preran motor 'lagbhag' sthir chaal par chalate hai
 Their gait variance is very less with weight
 at:, jin bhaaron ke liye sthir chaal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, vahaan ve bahut upyogi hote hai
 However, motor motors are not commonly used where variable speed is required
 inaki chaal tulykaalik chaal se kuch hi kam hoti he, jo dhruv sankhya tathaa aavriti par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore, to move around, it is necessary to either change the pole number, or to vary the frequency
 aavriti vicharan karne kaa taatpary he ki alag aise sambharan kii vyavastha karnaa jisaki aavriti badali ja sake
 Nowadays variable frequency drives are coming for this
 dhruv sankhya ko ek vishisht anupaat main, kundalan ke sambandhan main parivartan karke badla ja saktaa he, jaise ek 4 dhruvi motor ko 8 dhruvi athwa 6 dhruvi motor main parivartit karnaa sambhav he
 Thus the velocities corresponding to these pole numbers can also be obtained
 50 chakree aavriti par 4 dhruvi motor kii tulykaalik chaal 1,500 RPM or 6 dhruvi tathaa 8 dhruvi kaa kramash: 1,000 tathaa 750 RPM he
 In this way, by changing the pole number of such motor, its speed can be obtained
 par ye keval do yaa teen kramon main hi ho sakate hai
 By this method it is not possible to get the variance in a wide range

 This method is mostly used in rolling mills
 vibhinn prakaar ke mashin aujaaron main bhi vicharanshil chaal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, parantu unamem saamanyat:, chaal vicharan giyar kramon ko badalakar kiya jaataa he

 Before starting the fisheries, it is extremely important that the pond be fully suitable for planting fish seeds
 talab main aavashyaktaa se adhik jaleey paudhon kaa hona machhlee kii acchhee upaj ke liye hanikaarak he
 These plants cover a large part of the water, causing inconvenience to the fish
 saath hi yah surya kii kirnon ko pani ke andar pahunchane main bhi baadha utpann karte hai
 As a result, the fish stops producing natural food and in the absence of natural food, the growth of fish is adversely affected
 iske atirikt yah paudhe mitti main paye jane vaale rasinic padaarthon kaa prachushan karke apni badhottaree karte hai or pani kii paushtikta kam ho jaati he
 Even if the nets are run for fishing, these plants obstruct

 Debt control or 'credit control' is a system used by a business to do something that gives credit to customers who are only able to pay, and make timely payments to customers
 rin niyantran vishesh rup se bikri kiya jaataa he ek baar ve nakad yaa taral sansadhano ke rup main mahasoos kar rahe hai ki yah sunishchit karne ke liye vinirmaan kshetra main vyavsaayon dwaara niojit kar rahe hai ki vittiya niyantran kaa hissaa he
 Debt control prevents business from becoming liquidity or even lending to a financial institution to cause improper and un-coordinated issuance of debt to customers and is an important system of control
 rin sweekruti, credit seemaa anumodan, preshan manjuuri or saath hi sangrah kii prakriya - credit niyantran bhi shaamil he ki virgon ke ek number he
 In a large business, a credit process is run by a senior manager and know your customer such as account opening, loan and credit limit approval, credit expansion and collection action effectually
 arthvyavastha main rin ko niyantrit karne ke liye bhartiya rigerv bank kaa kaary sabase mahatvapurn he
 The basic and important requirements of debt control in the economy are- 1
unki aarthik sthiti yaa sarkaar byaaj par nirbhar karata he " praathamikta ke aadhaar par " ke rup main sarkaar dwaara manyata praapt he jo arthvyavastha ke un kshetron yani " praathamikta kshetra " ke samgr vikaas ko protsaahit karne ke liye
 These areas roughly total to about 15 in number
 2
credit avaanchhneeya uddeshyon ke liye nahin diya he, isliye he ki rin kaa tatikaran par ek check rakhane ke liye
 3
 To achieve the objective of controlling inflation as well as deflation
 4
vibhinn kshetron ke liye bank rin kii paryaapt maatra ke pravaah ko suvidhajanak banane ke dwaara arthvyavastha ko badhaava dene ke liye
 5
 To develop economy
 do tareekon se bhartiya rigerv bank arthvyavastha main mudra kii aapurti ko niyantrit karne ke liye upyog karata he
 During deflation during the period of the Reserve Bank of India's inflation it allows the commercial bank to pump money into the economy, while strengthening its policies to limit the money supply
 gunvattta se ham nirdesh diya he jo bank rin kaa upyog karata he matlab he
 Banks, for example, may feel that the audience or big capitalists, while the small scale industries, are struggling with a shortage of consumer goods industries and agricultural credit, are getting mostly on a large portion of the total debt due to various disturbances and inequalities in the economy
 
 visangati ke is prakaar ke sanshodhan ke gunatmak rin niyantran kii baat he
 The qualitative method governs the way of channelizing cash and debt in the economy
 aisa lagata he ki sthiti ke aadhaar par 'praathamikta kshetra' ke rup main janaa jaataa he duusare ke liye ke rup main failata he, jahaan kuch khand ke liye rin ke rup main pratibandhit niyantran kaa ek 'chaynaatmak paddati' he
 The devices used under this method are- rin kii seemaant aavashyaktaa = di gai rin kii rin-mulya ke liye peshkash kii suraksha ke vartmaan mulya
 There is a marginal need, which is attributed to the business activities of those who are restricted in the flow of the economy
 rin ke pravaah main vruddhi hui ho gaya he maamle main, seemaant aavashyaktaa kam ho jayega
 The Reserve Bank of India has used this method since 1956
 is vidhi ke tahat vanijyik bainkon se adhik nahin ho saktaa he, jo kiya ja saktaa he ki rin or agrim, ke liye ek adhiktam seemaa nahin he
 Reserve Bank of India fix ceiling for specific categories
 rin pravaah ko vishesh rup se satta gatividhiyon ke liye jaanch kii jaani he jab is tarah ke rashan sthitiyon ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 The minimum number of "capital: total assets" can also be determined by the Reserve Bank of India bhartiya rigerv bank ashaanti ko niyantrit karne ke liye vanijyik bainkon dwaara lagu kiya janaa aavashyak hoga ki bazaar kii maujuuda haalat par apane vichaaron or apni dishaao ke prachaar ke liye media kaa upyog karata he
 This method is not very successful in developing countries due to high illiteracy, although it is making it difficult for people to understand such policies and its implications
 banking viniman adhinium ke tahat kendriya bank rigerv bank of india dwaara die gaye nirdeshon kaa paalan karne ke liye manaa kar diya he ki vanijyik bainkon se kisi ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne kaa adhikaar he
 There can be no restriction on such banks to carry forward loans levied by the Reserve Bank of India
 jaise - bhartiya rigerv bank metropolitan sahakaari bainkon kii karypranali par kuch pratibandh laga diya tha
 Also 'bank of Karad' came to an end in 1992
 is vidhi ko bhi rigerv bank ja rahaa he ki bhartiya rigerv bank, yahan kaa upyog karata he rin ke pravaah par apane nirdeshon / adeshon kaa paalan karne ke liye vanijyik bainkon ko raji karne kaa he ki vidhi ke rup main "naitik anunay" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The Reserve Bank of India pressures commercial banks to put a ceiling on credit flow during deflation and to be lenient in lending
 maatraatmak rin niyantran se ham rin kii kul maatra kaa niyantran matlab he
 Consider, for example, that the central bank of America considers the rupee based on its calculations
 50,000 credit ke vistaar ke liye adhiktam surakshit seemaa he
 But the actual credit at that point of time is Rs
 55,000 
 Thus it then becomes necessary for the central bank to tighten its policies to bring it down to 50,000
 vaastavik credit kam he isi tarah agar, 45,000, to rigerv bank arthvyavastha main credit pumping ke paksh main apni nitiyon ko niyantrit karata he kahana
 The various devices used under this method are- yah bhi chhot dar ke rup main janaa jaataa he bank dar desh ke kendriya bank videshi mudra kii manjuuri de di bilon rediscount yaa anumodith pratibhutiyon par udhaar dene ke liye taiyaar he, jis par adhikari ne nunatam dar he
 Section 49 of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934, "it is remodeled for bill-exemption of market or other commercial paper eligible for purchase or purchase under this Act, at which the standard rate" The bank defines the rate
 udhaaharan ke liye vanijyik bank, vrath yaa uske sabhi uplabdh dhanrashi kaa nivesh kiya or or adhik se nirdhaarit nunatam upar kam yaa koi nakadi he gaya he, yah dhan ke liye kendriya bank puch sakate hai
 It can either rebate some of its bills with the central bank or it can automatically borrow from the central bank against the collateral of the promissory note
 yaa to maamle main, kendriya bank vanijyik bank accommodates or baad kii nakadi bhandar bad jaati he
 The supply of money in the economy is controlled when this rate has increased during times of inflation
 kisi bhi samay byaaj sattarudh kii vibhinn daron itane par vanijyik bainkon, bazaar discount dar or kii dar rin, jamaa dar kii tarah, bazaar main dekhte hai
 But since the central bank is the money market leader and lender of last resort, al other rates are closely related to the bank rate
 bank dar main parivartan, isliye, mudra bazaar ke rup main anya sabhi daron main parivartan se paalan kar rahe hai
 Credit control normally processes for issuing during the process of reporting and selling to the Finance Director or Risk Management Committee a potential customer or requesting for extended credit lines, whichever one current customer pays
 is bindu par nimnlikhit prakriya kaa paalan kiya ja saktaa he: - 1
 Formal letter given to a client entity Finance 2
 Head of Finance Department evaluates the requested credit
 3
 Risk managers evaluate if credit fits in with current risk portfolio
 Risk managers are evaluated both alone as a stand and to ensure that it does not exceed the payable period, particularly as a component of the working capital cycle
 5
bahari reating agenciyon graahak ko rin dene se judi jokhim kaa akalan karne ke liye lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Generally a firm's credit worthiness can be assessed independently by companies such as Dan and Bradstreet, Bloomberg, AC Nielsen or other reputable companies
 6
 fillars bhi ek form kii saakh kaa akalan karne ke liye bazaar main bana rahe hai7
 ek aantarik moolyankan laabh yaa ritern ke khilaaf bura yaa sandigdh rinon ke jokhim par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 8
 The extension of the loan will not result in loss of principal once the risk manager and finance director are satisfied
 rin diya jaataa he!9
 ek khate sahamat sharton ke liye rin setting set ke saath kholaa jaataa he - graahak majaa aayega credit kii cap or ve kehete hai ki credit majaa aayega jo shabdon yaa avadhi
 In other words, the value of credit is the aspect of the same coin over time
 ek baar vistaarit credit sharton ko kadai se lagu hojaane or peechha kiye jane par1
 prashan delivery par nakad ikattha karne ke liye sangharsh3
 chaalaan ek vivaad paidaa karnaa chahie khate ke bayaan kaa samarthan karne ke liye rakhaa janaa chahie
 4
 a reconciliation is usually done on a regular basis to ensure that both the supplier and customers have booked the same item and to resolve any booking differences
 5
 check ke chaalaan ke liye bhugtan kiya gaya he ki kya vastav main pataa chalata he ki ek preshan salaah ke saath bayaan ke khilaaf ek niyamit aadhaar par ekatra kar rahe hai
 6
 a booking entries are matched to the invoice payments so that they struggle to appear on the statement of account
 7
 graahak samay par bhugtan nahin karata he to ek kaal credit paalan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Credit can be issued to encourage growth in a business
 aantarik vikaas utpann, graahak vafadari kaarykram he ki vyapaar bad bikri rajasav sunishchit karen
 Credit is also stronger than other areas in competition, where it can be used as part of a business strategy to enter the market
 apane swayan ke samjhaute par haalanki credit jari karne ke liye ek vyapaar ranneeti nahin he ! Unreasonable debt can be a serious stress on the company and can lead to the failure of the company
 kai esemai ke kaaran asantoshjanak rin sangrah prakriyaaon yaa prakriyaaon main naakaam rahe hai
 During the credit crunch many businesses experience a serious debt risk and severely cut loan expansion to partner companies and businesses

 After this, along with all the other Vedas, it has been discussed prominently in the Vedic texts like Upanishads
 nirukt ke rachiyata yask ne dyusthaneey devataaon main surya ko pehle sthaan par rakhaa he
 In the last period of the later Vedic period, the human form of the sun began to be imagined

 Alcohol, despite its negative impact on the health, relationships, and social status of the drinker, is characterized by strong and uncontrolled alcohol consumption
 anya maadak padaarthon kii lat kii tarah, chikitsashastra main madyavyasanita ko chikitsa yogya beemaari ke rup paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 The term "alcoholism" has been widely used by Magnus Huss in 1849, but in the 1960s DSM III in medicine uses the term "alcohol abuse" and alcohol dependence in place of the term
 isi prakaar 1979 main vishwa swasthya sanghathan kii ek visheshgy samiti ne isaki naidanik sthiti ko dekhte hue madyavyasanita shabd ke upyog ko pasand nahin kiya or ise "sharaab nirbharta syndrome" kii shrenee main rakhe jane ko variyata di
 19veen or 20veen shatabdi kii shuruuaat main, "madyavyasanita" yaa piyakkadpan shabd ke chalan se pehle sharaab par nirbharta, madyonmad kehalaati thi
 Nonetheless, the biological process support for alcoholism is uncertain, although its risk factors are social environment, stress, mental health, genetic predisposition, age, ethnic group, and sex
 dirghakaalik sharaab kaa apaprayog yaa durupyog dimag ke shaareerik kriya main parivartan karata he, jaise ki isse sahansheeltaa or shaareerik rup se nirbharta prabhavit hoti he
 Such brain chemical changes maintain the alcoholic compulsive inability to abstain from alcohol consumption, and this results in alcohol withdrawal syndrome upon discontinuation of alcohol consumption
 sharaab mastishk sahit sharir ke lagbhag har ang ko nuksaan pahunchaati he, kyonki sanchayi vishaiylla prabhaav lambey samay se sharaab ke apaprayog ko prabhavit karata he, chikitsa se lekar maansik vikaron se peedit hona sharaab ke jokhim hai
 Alcoholism is a deep push for the social status of alcoholics and their families
 madyavyasanita sahansheeltaa, nirlyptata or atyadhik maatra main sharaab seven kii chakree maujuudagi he; uske yaa uski sehat ko honevaale nuksaan ke prati jaagruk hone ke baavjood pinevaala badhyakaari madhpan ko niyantrit karne main asamarth hota he, yah is baat kaa sanket he ki vah shaks piyakkad ho saktaa he

 Alcoholics are more susceptible to the physical, mental, and mental harmful effects of alcohol and social stigma than men in alcoholism

 The term "alcoholism" is commonly used, but is very poorly defined
 madyavyasanita ko dablyuechao ne "lambey samay se lagaataar upyog or parivarti arth" ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he or is shabd ke istemaal kaa 1979 main dablyuechao visheshgy samiti ne virodh kiya
 The Big Book states that once a person becomes a alcoholic, he is always a alcoholic, but in this context the meaning of the word "alcoholic" is not defined
 1960 main bill dablyoo
 ne kaha: For example, there is no such thing as heart disease
 balki isamen hriday ke bahut saare alag kism ke yaa inke sanyojit vikaar hote hai
 Alcoholism is something like this
 isliye ham madyavyasanita ko beemaari kah kar chikitsa vyavsaay ke saath kuch galat nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 That's why we always use the term more securely - calling it sickness, or disease
 peshewar or anusandhan sandarbhon main, "madyavyasanita" shabd main kabhi-kabhi sharaab kaa apaprayog or sharaab par nirbharta donon ko shaamil kar liya jaataa he
 And it is sometimes considered akin to alcohol dependence
 manovigyaan or manorog vigyaan main, dsam bahut hi saamaanya vaishvik maanak he, jabaki chikitsa main, aisidi maanak he
 The words these people have recommended are the same, but not integral
 shabd main aprishuddhi nihit hone ke baavjood, "madyavyasanita" shabd kaa jab saamana ho to isaki vyakhya kis tarah kii jaani chahie, ise paribhaashit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 In 1992, it was characterized by NCADD and ASAM as "a primary, chronic disease characterized by undue control of alcoholism, a drug-intoxicating, alcoholic use despite adverse consequences and a distortion in thinking
