 jalasantrasi kalilon ke nirmaan ke liye kai vidhiyaan prayukt hoti hai
 These methods can be divided into two classes - integration and disintegration
 pehali vidhi main aanaviya aakaar ke kanon ko dhire-dhire tab tak badhaayaa jaataa he jab tak ve kalilon kaa aakaar nahin praapt kar lete or unke adhik badhane kii gati kisi sthayitv pradaan karanevaale padaarth kii upasthiti se, athwa kisi jalpremi kalil ke mila dene se, niyantrit kar di jaati he
 By this method many metals, hydroxides, insoluble salts and silver halides used in photography have been made in the bud
 duusari vidhi se bade-bade kanon ko chote-chote kanon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In the braiding method metal pieces are obtained by breaking large pieces of metals with the help of electric arc
 is kaaran is vidhi ko vighatan kii vidhi kaha jaataa he, kintu vastav main ye kalil bhi ekikaran kii vidhi se hi banate hai
 The metal evaporates at high temperature of the arc
 phir vaashp ke ati sookshm kan ekikrut hokar kalilkanon kaa aakaar praapt kar lete hai
 In fact kalil-mill is the major means of making Kalil by partition
 is yantra main do platen, jo ek duusare ke atyant sameep rahati hai, paraspar vipareet disha main gumti he
 The material to be delivered is sent between these two plates with the appropriate medium
 is prakaar kan chote hokar kalil kanon kaa aakaar grahan kar lete hai
 For the treatment of the buds produced by any of the two methods, they are subjected to a different action by dialysis with a geminal substance
 aisa karne ke liye kalil ko parchament yaa celophen ke jhole main rakhaa jaataa he
 This bag is now kept in pure solvent
 yah vilaayak hi kalil kaa madhyam hota he
 Electrical dialysis can make refinement more complete and faster
 jalpremi kalil atyant sthaayee hote hai or vidyudvishleshya kii laghumatraaon ke prati niskriy hote hai
 Their stability is due to their solubility in the medium
 in kalilkanon kaa bahya tal madhyam ke anuon se dhakaa rahata he
 In this way the free energy of the outer plane is negligible
 isse ye kan aakaar main badhane main asamarth rahete hai
 In addition, it has been observed that water-soluble materials reduce the interstellar stress of the medium
 is prabhaav se bhi kalilon kaa sthayitv niyantrit rahata he
 The stability of the drainage systems is due to the charge located on the tubes
 kalilkanon ke bahya tal par aavesh kaa srijan unke dwaara avashoshit yanon ke kaaran hota he
 The charge at the bottom of the calculus decreases with the addition of an electrolyte, and gradually a situation arises when the bottom of the calculus at the lowest concentration of the electrolyte is unable to resist the forces of integration
 is prakaar vidyudvishleshya kaa vah nimnatam sandran, jo kisi kalil kii ek nishchit maatra ke avakshepan main samarth hota he, kalil kaa avakshepan maan kaha jaataa he
 In general, the higher the valence of the ion of the electrolyte, which is opposite to the charge of the alkaline, the stronger the precipitation power of the electrolyte
 jalasantrasi kalilon ko vidyudvishleshyon se surakshit rakhane ke liye unamem jalpremi kalil mila die jate hai
 This method is called conservation method

 jalasantrasi kalil ke sthayitv ke liye aavesh kaa sthaan pramukh he
 The type of charge depends on the physical nature of the substance and on the electrodynamic that provides stability to the particle
 udaahranarth yadi rajat iodide ke saul ko len to usapar aavesh kaa prakaar dhanatmak yaa rinatmak donon hi ho saktaa he
 If there is a subtle excess of silver nitrate in Kalil, then Saul will be positive
 iske vipareet yadi potacium iodide kaa aadhiky hua to saul rinatmak ho jayega
 It has been observed that the charge of the silver iodide membrane becomes positive due to the presumptive adsorption of the positive silver ion, and the charge of this ion becomes negative due to the negative ion adsorption of the positive iodide

 The electrical dynamic potential is different from the Nernst electrochemical potential
 ab siddh ho gaya he ki vaidyuthik rasinic vibhav vah vibhav he jo vitarit kala or vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The electrodynamic potential is the voltage that lies between the main volume of the distribution medium in the stationary part of the bicameral plane attached to that distributed art
 vitarit kala se sanlagn dwiktal kaa vaastavik swabhaav ab bhi kalpana kaa vishay he
 Nevertheless, it has been known that the electrodynamic-potential is particularly affected by the ions present
 gas ke niyam kalil vilyanon par thik baithte hai, iske paryaapt pramaan hai
 The curvature pressure of a Kalil can be calculated by the following equation: jahaan: Now, as the viscosity pressure is inversely proportional to the size of the particle, it makes it clear that the infusion pressure of the spiral should decrease and their volume should also increase with the distribution volume
 is prakaar saadhaarant: saulon kii rasakarshan daab kam hi hoti he or jab rasakarshan daab adhik ho jaati he to vah mukhyat: ashuddhiyon ke kaaran hi hoti he
 Measuring pressure is measured with the help of a semipermeable membrane

 The study of this balancing act has been studied on dyes, soaps, and many other collicular electrodynamics called Congo Red
 in sthitiyon main kalileey padaarth vidyudvishleshya ke samaan vyavhaar karata he
 When the shape of an ion is similar to the shape of the calculus, when the potential is created on both sides of the dilute, which is called the dilute potential
 kai protein saulon main tanupat-vibhav sadaiv hi utpann ho jaataa he or jivit selon par aavesh is tanupat santulan ke kaaran hi hota he
 The shape or form of the calculus cannot be seen by looking through a microscope

 Tipu Sultan was the ruler of the erstwhile Mysore state of Karnataka India
 tipu sultan kaa janm 20 navambar 1750 ko karnataka ke devnahalli kimi uttar me) hua tha
 His full name was Sultan Fateh Ali Khan Shahab
 unke pita kaa naam haidar ali or mata kaa naam fairunnisa tha
 His father Hyder Ali was the Sainapati of the Kingdom of Mysore, who by his own strength became the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore in 1761
 tipu ko mysore ke sher ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Apart from a worthy ruler, Tipu was also a scholar, skilled scholar, and poet
 tipu sultan ne hindu mandiron ko tohafe pesh kiye
 The temple at Melkot contains gold and silver utensils, whose inscriptions suggest that these were gifts by Tipu

 In the figure of Tipu, the British used to see a picture of Napoleon
 vah anek bhashaaon kaa gyaata tha apane pita ke samay main hi usne prashasnic sainik tathaa yuddh vidha leni prarambh kar di thi parantu uskaa sabase bada avagun yah tha ki vah ziddee or ghamandi vyakti tha
 This fortification led to his defeat
 He relied heavily on the Franciscans and regarded the powers of the native kings as he was as autocratic and independent as his father, but still cherished the sufferings of the subjects

 Scholars differ greatly regarding his character
 vibhinn angrej vidwaanon ne uski aalochana karte hue use atyaachaari or dharmant bataaya he
 According to history, Hyder rarely did any mistake and Tipu Sultan hardly did any work
 There is a saying in Mysore that Hyder was born to establish an empire
 or tipu use khone ke liye kuch aise bhi vidwaan he jinhone tipu ke charitra kii kaaphi prashansa kii he
 In fact, Tipu was an industrious ruler, a fundamental reformer and a great warrior

 Cornwallis knew that his war with Tipu was inevitable
 or isliye mahaan shaktiyon ke saath vah mitrataa sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 He entered into a joint front against Tipu by entering into an alliance with the Nizam and Marathas and after that he declared war against Tipu, thus the Third Mysore War started
 This war lasted for two years, initially the British failed but in the end It was won

 The Marathas also got some share which led to the border of their kingdom to Tangbhadra, the remaining parts were kept by the British
 Tipu Sultan gave his two Pugas as Carnatic to the Carnavalis
 This defeat caused Tipu Sultan to lose a lot of his power
 The state company was surrounded by the state and their contact with the sea was broken
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki cornwalis ne is sandhi ko karne main jaldbaaji ki or tipu kaa purna nivas nahin kar ke bhul ki agar vah tipu kii shakti ko kuchal detaa to bhavishya main chaturth misur yuddh nahin hota lekin vastav main cornwalis ne aisa nahin karke apni doordarshta kaa parichay diya tha us samay angreji sena main bimaari faili hui thi or europe main englad or france ke bich yuddh kii sambhaavana thi aisi sthiti main tipu francisiyon ki sahaayta le sakate the agar sampoorn rajya ko angrej british rajya main mila letaa to marathe or nizaam bhi usase jalane lagate isliye cornwalis kaa uddeshy yah tha ki tipu kii shakti samaapt ho jaae or saath hi saath company ke mitra bhi shaktishaalee nahin ban sake isliye unhone bina apane mitron ko shaktishaalee banaaye tipu kii shakti ko kuchalane kaa prayaas kiya
 Tipu Sultan was deeply saddened by this humiliating treaty and due to his infamy, he wanted to overcome the British and overcome, Prakriti gave him such an opportunity but fate did not support Tipu, at this time there was war going on in England and France
 To benefit from the international situation, Tipu sent his Rajdoot to different countries and he gave the Franciscans various types of facilities in their state
 Radaan that its military organization they are Frsisi officer Nyukt and they help against the British that were necessary conflict between April 1798 e
 Some French Tipu result reached for assistance in English and Tipu
 is samay lard velesli bengal kaa governor general niyukt kiya gaya tha
 He decided to crush Tipu's power against Tipu
 He succeeded in tying up with the Nizam and the Marathas to combine the Nizam, but the Marathas did not give a clear answer
 In 1798, Wellejali entered into an alliance with the Nizam and this Announced that some part of the conquered territories should also be given to the Marathas
 With full preparation, Wellejali attacked Mysore in this way
 Ddh began
 prarambh se hi tipu sultan ek parakramee yodha the
 By the end, the British died in Mysore while fighting, thus 33 years ago, the Muslim power which had emerged in Mysore did not just end, but the drama of the British Mysore war ended
 misur jo 33 varshon se lagaataar angrejon ki pragati kaa dushman bana tha ab vah angrejon ke adhikaar main aa gaya tha angrej or nizaam ne mil kar misur kaa batwaaraa kar liya kuch hissaa angrejon ko mila or kuch par nizaam kaa adhikaar sweekaar kiya gaya maraathon ko bhi uttar pashchim main kuch pradesh diye gayi lekin usne lene se inkaar kar diya bachaa hua misur rajya misur ke puraane hindu rajvansh ke ek naaballik ladke ko de diya gaya or uske saath angrejon ne ek sandhi ki is sandhi ke anusaar misur kii suraksha kaa bhaar angrejon par aa gaya vahaan british sena tainaat kiya gaya sena kaa kharch misur ke raja ne dena sweekaar kiya
 The British benefited greatly from this policy, the kingdom of Mysore became very small and the enemy of the enemy came to an end, it increased the power of the company considerably, it returned the part of the Marathas and as a result, Mysore was surrounded by the British from all sides
 He raised in the future which greatly helped in the development of British power and one day he established his suzerainty over the whole of India
 
 kuch ghatnaon or dastavejon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki tipu sultan dharmandh musalmaan tha
 In the 19th century, William Logan, an official and author of the Government of Batani, wrote in his book 'malabar Manual' how Tipu Sultan, along with his team of 30,000 soldiers, wreaked havoc in Calicut
 tipu sultan hathi par savaar tha or uske peeche uski vishaal sena chal rahi thi
 Men and women were hanged publicly
 unke bacchon ko unheen ke gale main baandh par latakaaya gaya
 In the same book, William also writes that orders were given to dismantle the city's temples and churches
 yaheen nahin, hindu or isaai mahilaon kii shaadi jabaran muslim yuvakon se karai gai
 The men were asked to adopt Muslim religion and whoever denied it was ordered to be killed
 1791 main raghunatha raav patavardhan ke kuch maratha savaaron ne shringery shankaracharya ke mandir or math par chapa maaraa
 They looted all the valuable property of the monastery
 is hamale main kai log maare gaye or kai ghayal ho gaye
 Shankaracharya applied to Tipu Sultan for help
 shankaracharya ko likhi ek chitthee main tipu sultan ne aakrosh or du:kha vyakt kiya
 After this, Tipu ordered Asaf of Bedanur to give 200 relief cash and other gifts to Shankaracharya
 shringery mandir main tipu sultan kii dilchaspee kaafii saalon tak jari rahi, or 1790 ke dashak main bhi ve shankaracharya ko khat likhte rahe
 These letters of Tipu were written after the Third Mysore War, when Tipu suffered a number of setbacks including giving his two sons as hostages
 yah sambhav he ki tipu ne ye khat apni hindu praja kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye likhe the
 Tipu Sultan also presented gifts to other Hindu temples
 malkot ke mandir main sone or chaandi ke bartan he, jinke shilaalekh bataate hai ki ye tipu ne bhent kiye the
 Had presented four silver cups to the Lakshmikant temple of Kalale
 1782 or 1799 ke bich, tipu sultan ne apni jaagir ke mandiron ko 34 daan ke sanad jari kiye
 Many of these presented silver and gold plate gifts
 nanajangud ke shrikanteshwar mandir main tipu kaa diya hua ek ratna-jadit cap he
 Tipu presented a green Shivling to the Nanjundeshwar temple of Nanjangud
 shrirangpatna ke ranganath mandir ko tipu ne saat chaandi ke cap or ek rajat kapur-jvaalik pesh kiya
 Some claim that these donations were a way of forming alliances with Hindu rulers
 4 may 1799 ko 48 varsh kii aayu main karnataka ke shrirangapattana main tipu ko dhoke se angrejon dwaara qatl kiya gaya
 Tipu died fighting while fighting the British till his last breath
 unki talwaar angarez apane saath britain le gaye
 After Tipu's death, the entire kingdom fell into the hands of the British
 vishnudharmottar puraana ek uppurana he
 Its nature is encyclopedic
 kathaon ke atirikt isamen brahmand, bhugol, khagolashastra, jyotish, kaal-vibhaajan, kupit grahon evam nakshatron ko shant karnaa, prathaen, tapasya, vaishnavon ke kartavya, kanoon evam raajnneeti, yudhniti, maanav evam pashuon ke rogon kii chikitsa, khanpan, vyakaran, chand, shabdkosh, bhaashankala, naatak, nrity, sangeet or anekanek kalaon kii charchaa kii gayi he
 It is considered the culmination of Vishnupurana
 vrihaddharm puraana main di hui 18 puraanon kii suchi main vishnudharmottar puraana bhi he
 The method is called a rule code
 vidhi praayah bhaleebhanti likhi hui sansuchakon ke rup main hoti he
 Law is very important for running the society in a proper manner
 vidhi manushya kaa aacharan ke ve saamaanya niyam hote he jo rajya dwaara sweekrut tathaa lagu kiye jate he, jinka paalan anivarya hota he
 The judiciary punishes for non-compliance
 kanoonee pranali kai tarah ke adhikaron or jimmedaariyon ko vistaar se bataati he
 The word law itself seems to be a word associated with the creator
 aadhyatmik jagat main 'vidhi ke vidhaan' kaa aashay 'vidhaataa dwaara banaaye hue kanoon' se he
 It is a law made by the life and death creator or can be called the law of law
 saamaanya rup se vidhaataa kaa kanoon, prakruti kaa kanoon, jeev-jagat kaa kanoon evam samaaj kaa kanoon
 Today the whole world is being affected by the state-made law
 raajnneeti aaj samaaj kaa anivaary ang ho gaya he
 Every organism of the society is governed by laws
 aaj samaaj main bhi vidhi ke shashan ke naam par duniya bhar main sarkarein nagarikon ke liye vidhi kaa nirmaan karti he
 The purpose of law is to regulate the conduct of society
 adhikaar evam dayitvon ke liye spasht vyakhya karnaa bhi he saath hi samaaj main ho rahe anaikatik kaary yaa lokaneeti ke viruddh hone vaale kaaryo ko aparaadh ghoshit karke aparaadhiyon main bhay paidaa karnaa bhi aparaadh vidhi kaa udeshy he
 From 1945 till today, the United Nations, through its charter or through its various relevant organizations, tried to tell the states and citizens of the world that development of society is not possible without peace but co-existence for peace and It is important not only to have a fair attitude but also to revive the conduct
 nyaaypurna samaaj main hi shanti, sadbhaav, maitri, sashastitv kaayam ho paata he
 Law means the code of rules, instructions, restrictions and entitlements governing and governing human behavior
 lekin yah bhoomika to naitik, dharmik or anya saamaajik samhitaon kii bhi hoti he
 Actually, the law differs from these codes in many ways
 pehali baat to yah he ki kanoon sarkaar dwaara banaaya jaataa he lekin samaaj main use sabhi ke upar samaan rup se lagu kiya jaataa he
 Secondly, by taking the form of 'will of the state', it takes precedence over all other social rules and standards
 tisare, kanoon anivaary hota he arthath nagarikon ko uske paalan karne ke chunaav kii swatantraaa nahin hoti
 There is a provision of punishment in law for those who do not follow
 lekin, kanoon keval dand hi nahin detaa
 It also provides rules for contracting between individuals or parties, marriage, succession, distribution of benefits and governing institutions
 kanoon sthapit saamaajik naitiktaaon kii pushti kii bhoomika bhi nibhaataa he
 Fourth, the law is 'public' in nature because it is composed of formal legislative procedures as a code of published and recognized rules
 ant main kanoon main apane anupaalan kii ek naitik baadhyataa nihit he jiske tahat ve log bhi kanoon kaa paalan karne ke liye majaboor hote hai jinhen vah anyaaypurna lagata he
 The political system, whether democratic or totalitarian, has to run on the basis of some code of law
 lekin, loktantric vyavasthaaon main badalte samay ke saath apraasangik ho gayi yaa nyaaypurna na samajhe jane vaale kanoon ko radd karne or uski jagah nayaa behatar kanoon banane kii maang karne kaa adhikaar hota he
 a notable role of law is also believed to be to educate citizens to run the society in an organized style
 shuruyaat main raajnneetishastra ke centre main kanoon kaa adhyayan hi tha
 Political philosophers have been embroiled in intense debates over the question of the essence and structure of law
 kanoon ke vidwaanon ko maanavshaastra, raajnneetik arthshaastra, natikshastra or vidhaayi mulya-pranali kaa adhyayan bhi karnaa padataa he
 The notion of 'rule of law' prevails in liberal democracies operating on a constitutional basis
 in vyavasthaaon main kanoon ke daayre ke baahar koi kaam nahin karata, na vyakti or na hi sarkaar
 Behind this is the liberal principle of law according to which the purpose of law is not to impose restrictions on the person but to guarantee his freedom
 udaarataavaadi siddhant maanata he ki kanoon ke bina vyaktigat aacharan ko sanyamit karnaa naammumkin ho jayega or ek ke adhikaron ko duusare ke haathon hanan se bachaaya nahin ja sakegaa
 Thus in the language of John Locke, law means the law to protect life, liberty and property
 udaarataavaadi siddhant spasht karata he ki kanoon ke banane or lagu karne ke tareeke koun-koun se hone chahie
 For example, the law should be made through mutual consultation by elected lawmakers
 duusare, koi kanoon pichhali tarikh se lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki us surat main vah nagarikon ko un kaamon ke liye dandit karegaa jo tatkaaleen kanoon ke mutabik kiye gayi the
 Similarly, liberal law is against the punishment of cruel and inhuman kind
 raajnneetik prabhaavon se nirpeksh rahane vaali ek nishpaksh nyaaypalika kii sthapana kii jaati he taaki kanoon kii vyavasthit vyakhya karte hue pakshakaron ke bich uske aadhaar par faisalaa ho sake
 Marxists believe that the concept of rule of law works in the name of guaranteeing individual freedom while protecting property rights and protecting the capitalist system
 iskaa nateeja saamaajik vishmata or vargeey prabhutv ko banaaye rakhane main nikalataa he
 Marx considers law like politics and ideology to be part of a superstructure or superstructure whose base or basis is laid on the method of capitalist production
 nariwadiyon ne bhi kanoon ke shashan kii avadharana kii aalochana kii he ki vah langik nishpakshta par aadhaarit nahin he
 That is why the judiciary and the profession of law are occupied by men
 bahusamskritwad ke pairokaron kaa tark he ki kanoon asal main prabhutvshaalee saanskrithik samoohon ke mulyon or ravaiyon kii numaaindgi hi karata he
 As a result, the values and concerns of minority and marginalized groups continue to be ignored
 kanoon or naitikta ke bich antar ke sawaal par darshanik shuru se hi sir khapate rahe hai
 The basis of law is the belief of those who believe in the moral system, in the principle of 'natural law'
 plato or unke baad arestu kii manyata thi ki kanoon or naitikta main nazadiiki rishta hota he
 a just society can only be one in which the laws affirm wisdom based on moral rules
 madhyayugin isai vichaarak thomas equina bhi maanate the ki is dharti par uttam jivan vyateet karne ke liye natural lau yani ishwar pradutt naitiktaaon ke mutabik kanoon hone chahie
 In the nineteenth century, the theory of natural law became ineffective as the prestige of rationalism and scientific outlook increased
 kanoon ko naitik, dharmik or rahasywaadee manyataon se mukt karne kii koshishen huin
 John Austin established 'legal positivism' which claimed that the law was concerned not with a higher moral or religious principle, but with a sovereign person or institution
 kanoon isliye kanoon he ki uskaa paalan karavaaya jaataa he or karnaa padataa he
 HLA is a far more practical and naive interpretation of legal positivism
 Hart's work is found in 'the Concept of Law'
 heart kanoon ko naitik niyamon ke daayre se nikaal kar maanav samaaj ke sandarbh main paribhaashit karte hai
 According to him, law is a combination of first and secondary rules
 pratham shrenee ke niyamon ko 'kanoon ke saar' kii sangya dete hue heart kehete hai ki unka sambandh saamaajik vyavhaar ke viniman se he
 Like, foreclosure law
 dwitiya shrenee ke niyam sarkari sansthaaon ko hidaayat dete hai ki kanoon kis tarah banaaya jaae, unka kis tarah karyanvayan kiya jaae, kis tarah uske aadhaar par faisale kiye jaaen or in aadhaaron par kis tarah uski vaidhata sthapit kii jaae
 The theory of legal positivism propounded by Hart has been criticized by political philosopher Ronold Dwarkin
 unke anusaar kanoon keval niyamon kii samhita hi nahin hota or na hi aadhunik vidhi pranaliyaan kanoon kii vaidhata sthapit karne ke liye kisi ek samaan tareeke kaa praavdhaan karti hai
 The debate between the law and morality also arose in the Nuremberg lawsuit punishing the atrocities of the Nazis
 prashn yah tha ki kya un kaamon ko aparaadh tehraaya ja saktaa he jo rashtriya kanoon ke mutabik kiye gayi hon? iske jawaab ke liye prakritik kanoon kii avadharana kaa sahaara liya gaya, lekin uski abhivyakti maanavadhikaron kii bhashaa main hui
 Indeed, the question of the relationship between law and morality is highly complex and continues to arise in the context of issues such as abortion, prostitution, pornography, violence in TV and films, mother-of-the-womb, and genetic engineering

 Despite many criticisms, George Elton Mayo is considered the father of "human resource management"
 1985 europea cap final hesal stadium, brusselles, belgium main 29 may 1985 ko italy ke juvents or england ke liverpool ke bich ek footbal match tha

 Liverpool fans accused a fence breach and Juventus fans for separating the two groups of supporters
 The resulting weight of people killed 39 people and injured hundreds, causing a retaining wall to collapse

 Injections will usually be required for about 10 days
 During this cycle, natural ovulation is usually prevented with the use of gnrh agonists that begin before or during stimulation, or with the use of gnrh antagonists that are used only during the last days of stimulation; Both factors block the natural overgrowth of luteinizing hormones, and the physician can initiate the process of ovulation with the help of drugs, usually injectable human coronary gonadotropins
 jab yah tay kiya jaataa he putakeey paripakvata upyukt he, to human korionic gonedotropins diya jaataa he
 This factor, acting as an analogue of luteinizing hormone, caused ovulation to occur 42 hours after injection, but a recovery process commenced just before that to receive the ovarian cells from the ovary

 Although in many Canadian, American and Australian programs, embryos are housed in a long culture system and transfer is performed about five days after retrieval at the blastocyst stage, especially if there are still many high quality embryos available on the third day
 It has been observed that blastocyst phase transfers result in higher conception rates

 Operation Meghdoot was the code-name for the operation of the Indian Armed Forces to occupy the Siachen Glacier in the state of Jammu and Kashmir of India, which was associated with the Siachen conflict
 13 april 1984 ko shuru kiya gaya yah sainya abhiyaan anokhaa tha kyonki duniya kii sabase oonchai par sthit yudhakshetra main pehali baar hamalaa shuru kiya gaya tha
 As a result of the army's action, the Indian Army gained control of the entire Siachen glacier
 aaj, bhartiya sena kii tainaati ke sthaan ko vaastavik ground posishan line ke rup main janaa jaataa he, kabhi-kabhi galat tareeke se oparation meghdoot bhi kaha jaataa he
 Ten infantry battalions, each of the Indian Army and Pakistani Army, are actively deployed at altitudes up to 6,400 meters
 siachin glacier ,july 1 9 4 9 ke karachi samjhauta main ullikhit aspasht simaaon ke baad vivaad kaa ek kaaran ban gaya tha, jo yah nahin nirdisht karata tha ki siachin glacier kshetra par kiskaa adhikaar tha
 The Indian interpretation was that the Pakistani territory extended only to the Saltoro Pass, based on the Simla Agreement, where the last boundary of the regional line route is "north of the glaciers" of 'NJ 9842'
 pakistan kaa maananaa yah tha ki unka kshetra 'uttar enje 9842' se uttar-purv main karakoram darra tak jari rahaa
 As a result, both countries claimed wastelands and the Siachen Glacier
 1970 ke dashak or 1980 ke dashak main pakistan ne pakistani chor se siachin kshetra kii chotiyon par chadhane ke liye kai parvatarohan abhiyaanon kii anumati di thi joki shaayad is kshetra main unke daawey ko majboot karne kii koshish thi
 As with Pakistan teams, a liaison officer of the Pakistan Army used to stay with these teams in the operations permitted by the Government of Pakistan
 1978 main, bhartiya sena ne bhi un parvatarohan abhiyaanon ko glacier tak pahunchane kii anumati di thi jo bharat kii or se chadhaai kar rahe the
 The most notable of these was an expedition to Teram Kangri by Colonel Narinder "bull" Kumar of the Indian Army, with medical officer Captain AVS Gupta
 bhartiya vaayu sena ne 1978 main rasad or rasad kii aapurti ke madhyam se is abhiyaan main mahatvapurn sahaayta pradaan kii
 The first aerial landing on the glacier occurred on 6 October 1978 when two casualties, SAP LDR Monga and Flying Officer Manmohan Bahadur, were evacuated from the advance base camp
 glacier sthit in abhiyaanon ke dwaara donon pakshon ne apane apane daavon par jor diya
 In particular, when Pakistan permitted a Japanese expedition to scale a significant peak in 1984, Pakistan's attempts to legitimize its claim began to be viewed with suspicion
 siachin glacier ke purvi or se aksai chin ,jisapar china dwaara kabja kar liya gaya he ,par nazar rakhi ja sakati he
 The Indian Army believed that this operation could create a link from the Karakoram range of northeast China to a trade route on the southwestern Pakistani side that would benefit the Pakistani armed forces
 bhartiya sena ne 13 april 1984 ko glacier ko niyantrit karne kii yojana banaai thi, taaki lagbhag 4 dinon tak pakistani sena ko bhulaave main rakhaa ja sake, kyonki khufia jaankaree ke anusaar pakistani sena ne 17 april tak glacier par kabza karne kii yojana banaai thi
 For this operation, Meghdoot, the divine cloud messenger of the 4th century AD Sanskrit drama, was named by Kalidasa, Operation Meghdoot led by Lieutenant General Prem Nath Hoon, the then General Officer Commanding 15 Corp in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir
 oparation meghdoot kii taiyaari ke liye, bhartiya vaayu sena dwaara bhartiya sena ke sainikon kii hawaii yatra se shuruyaat kii
 The Indian Air Force used the I-06, AN-12 and AN-32 in high altitude airspace to store and supply troops as well as airports
 vahaan se emai -17, emai -8 or echeel chetak helicopter dwaara aapurti saamagree evam sainiko ko le jaaya gaya
 The first phase of the operation began in March 1984 with a foot march to the eastern base of the glacier
 kumaun regiment kii ek purna batalian or ladakh scouts kii ikaiyaan, yuddh saamagree ke saath jojila darre se hote hue siachin kii or badi
 Units under the command of lieutenant-colonel DK Khanna walked on foot to avoid detection of large troop movements by Pakistani radars
 
 The first unit to establish India's favorable position on the glacier heights was headed by Major RS Sandhu
 captain sanjay kulkarni kii aguwai vaali agali ikai ne bilapond laa ko surakshit kiya
 The remaining deployed units marched for four days under the command of Captain PV Yadav and proceeded to secure the hills of Saltoro Pass
 13 april tak, lagbhag 300 bhartiya sainikon ko mahatvapurn chotiyon main khandakon main sthapit kiya gaya tha or jab pakistan ke sainik is kshetra main unhone paaya ki bhartiya sena ne siya laa, billfond laa paas ke sabhi teen bade parvat or 1987 main gian laa or pashchim saltoro darre sahit siachin glacier ke sabhi commanding hits par niyantran kar liya tha
 Due to the high altitude and limited time, Pakistan was only able to control the western slopes and foothills of the Salthoro Pass despite the fact that it had greater ground access than India, while India relied primarily on air support
 apane sansmaranon main, purv pakistani raashtrapati general parvaiz musharraf ne kaha ki pakistan ne kshetra kaa lagbhag 900 varg mile kho diya he
 According to Time the Indian advance military line occupied about 1,000 square miles of the territory claimed by Pakistan
 asthaayee shiviron ko jald hi donon deshon ke sthaayee shiviron main parivartit kar diya tha
 The casualties on both sides during this particular operation are not known
 oparation ke ranneetik mulya par bhinn vichaar hai
 Some see it as an impartial occupation of non-strategic lands that reveal conflicting relations between India and Pakistan
 bahutayat main jaankaar is oparation ko bhartiya sainya dwaara "saahsee" safalataa ke rup main maanate hai or jo yah sunishchit karata hai ki bhartiya sena ne glacier ke pashchim main ranneetik saltoro darre par samrik drushti se mahatvapurn hisse par kabja kiya
 The Indian Army currently controls the 70-km-long Siachen Glacier and all its tributary glaciers, as well as the three main factions of the Saltoro Pass west of Glacier, Sia La, Bilafond La, and Giang La
 , is prakaar ucch bhoomi kaa samrik laabh ise miltaa hai
 The cost of supplying, operating and maintaining logistics in this region is extremely expensive for both armies
 1987 main or phir 1989 main pakistan ne bharat dwaara niyantrit darre par kabja karne hamalaa kiya
 The first attack was led by the then brigadier-general Pervez Musharraf and initially managed to gain some hills
 baad main usee varsh pakistan ne kam se kam ek pramukh pakistani post, "kaayade " ko khoyaa, jo bhartiya sena ke niyantran main 'bana post' bani, jo ki bana singh ke naam se jaani
 An important operation, named Operation Rajiv, led by Bana Singh, during the daytime, Bana Singh was awarded India's highest gallantry award, the Param Vir Chakra, for climbing and capturing 1500 feet of snow
 bana post duniya kaa sabase ooncha yudhakshetra he jo samudr str se 22,143 feet kii oonchai par he
 The second attack also failed in 1989 as the ground situation did not change
 siachin kshetra or baad main asafal sainya abhiyaanon kii haani par benazir bhutto ne mohammad zia-ul-haq ke liye kaha tha ki 'unhen burka pahananaa chahie kyonki vah apni mardaangi kho chuke hai'
 Although no reliable data is available, the two sides lost many soldiers due to weather and difficult terrain, and many were killed and killed due to avalanches

 Kumaon region has a distinct regional identity with its rich cultural, natural beauty and wealth

 In many ways this terrain is untouched by the root development of industrial scientism

 There is a rich oral tradition of folk literature, which is still alive for generations
 kumaun kaa astitv bhi vaidic kaal se he
 The area mentioned by the name of Manas Khand in the Manas Khand and other mythological literature of Skanda Purana is the present Kumaon Mandal
 is kshetra main bhi anek pracheen mandir or tirth sthal hai
 Several dialects are spoken in the Kumaon region
 kuch mukhya sthaneey bhashaaain is prakaar hai:- Various opinions have been prevalent regarding the derivation of the word Kumaon
 bhashaa kii drushti se yahi uchit jaan padataa he ki yah shabd multah sanskrit main kurm he
 There is a 2196 meter high Kanteshwar mountain near Champawat in respect of which Lord Vishnu in his second incarnation stayed on this mountain for three years
 tab se vah parvat kanteshwar ke sthaan par kurm-anchal naam se janaa jane laga
 The shape of this mountain also looks like the back of a tortoise
 sambhavtah isi kaaran is kshetra kaa naam kurmanchal padaa hoga
 At first the word Kurma may have come into use, because the word Kurm is found in abundance in the local language
 kurm ke sthaan par kumuun shabd nishpann hone kaa ek kaaran yah bhi ho saktaa he ki yahan kii boliyon main ukaarantata adhik pai jaati he
 Later, in the literary texts, copper letters, the word Kuma was replaced by Kumaon and then the word Kumaon was accepted
 sanskrit granthon main bhi kurmanchal shabd kaa prayog miltaa he
 In the absence of authentic historical facts, it is difficult to say with certainty which human castes were originally dominated in the Kumaon region
 mahabharat, puraana or pracheen sanskrit sahitya main uplabdh katipay sandarbhon se gyaat hota he ki yahan kiraat, kinnar, yaksha, tangav, kulind, khas ityadi jatiyaan nivas karti thim
 In the forest festival of Mahabharata, the castes residing in the uplands of the central Himalayas have been described as Kirat, Tangava and Kulint
 kiraantathanganakeern kulind shat sankulam
 Enumerating the names of those present in Yudhishthira's rajasuya-yajna, Duryodhana states that the mountain king named khas-ekasan, Parada, Kulind, Tangava and Paratangana, residing on the banks of the Shailoksha river in the middle of the Meru temple mountains, is a black chambar and gold of Pipilika caste
 Had brought dronparv main aayaa he ki ukt parvatiy jatiyon ne pathar ke hathiyaaron se mahabharat kii ladaai main duryodhana kii ore se bhaag lekar krishna ke sarathi saatyaki par chaaron ore se patharav kiya tha, kintu saatyaki ke naraachon ke samaksh ve na tik sake
 The Brahmapurana and the Vayupurana provide signs of the existence of castes like Kirat, Kinnar, Yaksha, Gandharva, Vidyadhar, Nag, etc
 in the central Himalayas
 skanda puraana ke maanas khand main kosi sthit kashay parvat naam se varnit girimala ko almoda kaa pahari bhu-bhaag mana gaya he- kushiki shalmali madhye punyah kashay parvatah
 Tasya ran west, Vishno Vishishtam
 almoda main jaakhan devi kaa mandir is baat kaa pramaan he ki atyant pracheen kaal main yahan dakshon kaa awaas rahaa he
 Kalidasa's "ka" Yaksha tells Meghha to mark the identity of Alkapuri, saying that his Priya must have spread flowers on the door of his door over the conceptions of shankha-padma
 dwarapante likhit vapushon shankhapadmau c drushtva tathaa vinyasyanti bhuvigananaya dehalidant pushpai : In various aspects of cultural life, this practice is still present on the occasion of various festivals in Kumaon
 yaksha jati ke alaava aadi yug main kumaanun main naag jati ke nivas ke sanket bhi milte hai
 There is a famous temple of Binag / Beninag in a place called Berinag in Pithoragarh district
 naagon ke naam par kumaanun main or bhi kai mandir he
 Such as Dhaulnag, Kalinag, Pingalnag, Kharhrynag, Basuki Nag, Nagdev etc
 kumaun kii aadim jatiyon main yaksha or naag jati ke astitv kii kalpana anumaanon par aadhaarit he kintu kiraat jati ke sambadh main kuch samaaj shastreey evam nrivaigyanik pramaanon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki pragaitihaasik yug main kumaanun-gadhwal ke bhu-bhaag kiraat, mongol aadi aryetar jatiyon ke nivas kshetra rahe, jinhen kaalaantar main uttar-pashchim kii ore se aane vaale avaidic khas aaryon ne vijit kar liya
 It is also likely that the Munda-speaking Kirat caste of the Agni family dominated the region for a long time, otherwise it would not have been known as Kiratamandal in ancient times
 apane swatantra bhashaai astitv ke saath kiraaton ke vanshaj aaj bhi kumaun ke askot evam didihat naamak sthanon main maujuud hai
 In Kumaon dialects, many such words are still prevalent, which seem to be the remnants of the prehistoric dialects, such as Dhud, Lydun, Jung, Jhungar, Phang, Thanghar, Ganga, Lyat etc
 In addition to vocabulary, certain grammatical elements are also ignorant
 The languages of the family are similar, such as kumuni karma causative indicator kani / kan suffixes of Munda's Bhoveasi and Kork earrings have k / kin or khe / khin
 bees ke samooh ke aadhaar par ginaney kii paddati raji or kumaunni main samaan rup se milti he
 Kumiuni is the word Bisi for a group of twenty
 kiraat jati ke alaava kumaanun kshetra main himalay ke uttaranchal main nivas karne vaali bhotiya jati kaa bhi prabhutv rahaa
 The word Bhotia is basically Boat or Bhot
 tibet ko bhot desh yaa bhutan bhi kaha jaataa he tathaa us desh se sambandhit hone ke kaaran vahaan ke nivaasiyon ko bhotiya kaha gaya
 The language of the Bhotis was called Tibetan
 yah tibeti se nikatataa rakhti he
 Local differences are found in the language of Johor Darma, Beans and Chaudans
 bhotiyon kii boli johari par kumaunni kaa prabhaav spasht parilakshith hota he
