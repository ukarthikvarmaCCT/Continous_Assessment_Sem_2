 So gradually the biographical power in him also decreases and he even surrenders himself to destruction in a way
 yah sarvavidit he ki puure sansar main tambaaku kaa durupyog cigarette ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It is also used in India in other forms
 jaise bidi, hukka, gul, gudaku, zarda, kimam, kheni, gutkha aadi ke rup main

 is kaaran log iske aadi ho jate he, usee prakaar jaise log sharaab yaa anya padaarthon ke aadi ho jate he or jab koi kisi padaarth kaa aadi ho jaae to uskaa niyamit seven uski baadhyataa ho jaati he
 Cigarette smokers are not only causing physical harm to themselves by cigarettes but also indirectly causing tobacco poisoning in family and children
 yah sab jaanate hue bhi vah inkaa seven band nahi kar pate
 Whenever they stop consuming it, they feel so uneasy that they start consuming them again
 iske liye aavashyakta he ki vyakti khud ko taiyaar kare ki vah ek nishchit din se dhumrapan karnaa band kar degaa
 Announce it to the whole family
 nishchit din ke pehle ghar se cigarette paauch, ashtray, aadi dhumrapan vastuon ko phenk de
 Stop smoking on a certain day
 yadi dhumrapan karne kii ichha ho to apane ko santvawna de
 Drink more and more water
 aisa karke aap dhumrapan karnaa chhod sakate hai
 a lot of it depends on your will power
 kheni, zarda khaanaa yaa gul, gudaku kaa adhik prayog kisi bhi tarah dhumrapan ke upyog se alag nahi he
 If one wants to give up these substances, then he can prepare himself and get rid of the habits of these substances by willpower

 Roshni lived in Nagpur with her elder sister Neha and father
 badi bahan neha, mumbai ke regents vishvavidhyalay me chaatr thi
 In order to avenge his death, Roshni enters there
 is baat ko chupaaye rakhane hetu roshni apane pita ko yah bataati he ki uskaa daakhila new york ke kisi vishvavidhyalay main hua he
 Neha's seniors Gauri, UD, Nihal, Roy and Zara were the real reasons for her suicide
 har din use chhedaa jaataa tha jiske kaaran pareshaan hokar usne atmahatheya kar lee
 But oblivious to this, the media and the university called his intoxication a reason for suicide
 uske maut kaa asli kaaran keval, bahan roshni ko pataa tha
 Roshni was an introverted girl and they used to dominate all five colleges
 college main saare chaatr un paanch seniors se darate the
 Roshani wanted to be a member of his group to avenge him
 vah unke saath rahakar unase badla lenaa chaahati thi
 She becomes his friend to Gautam, younger brother of Gauri, the main member of the group
 vah gauti ko hani nahin pahunchaana chaahati he parantu use gauti kii dosti ko majabuuran un pancho ke khilaaf istamaal karnaa padataa he
 She also jumps from a high place to the water swimming pool at the behest of those five, where Gotti gives her
 bachaata he
 a few days later, she avoids committing suicide by Zauri, Gauri's closest friend
 is prakaar samooh main roshni sabhi kaa vishwaas jeet leti he
 But at the behest of those five, she also closes her hostel roommate Shivani in a box
 par baad main vah shivani ko apane kathor vyvahaar kii kaaran samajhaati he
 Nikhil and Shivani accompany him in this scheme of lights
 roshni apane doston ke saath ab tak ke sabhi yojnao me safl hoti he
 But the question is, will Roshani be successful in all his plans? The role of Roshni is very challenging in this serial
 gauri samooh ki mukhya paatr he
 Not only does she dominate her friends in college, she also rules the entire college
 gauri or yudi dharawahik main premi he
 Gauri annoys Roshani the most and also suspects her goodness
 gauri ne hi roshni ko tarantaal main chalaang lagane ko kaahaa tha
 Gauri's parents live in America and are very proud of their money
 vah apane samooh or apane bhai gauti ke alaava kisi par vishwaas nahin karti
 When Roshni saves Zara's life, Gauri slowly believes in him and joins him in his group
 gauti or roshni ki dosti se gauri zyaada khush nahi he or vah roshni ko yah bhi kahti he kii roshni ko gauti se zyaada use guruta dena paregaa
 His friends are everything for Gauri
 zaaraa gauri ki mitra kam or uski chamachi zyaad he
 Zara's dream is to become a famous singer
 jab roshni ko is sapane ke bare main pataa chalata he to vah thaan leti he ki vah zaaraa ke sabase bade sapane ko tod degi

 But Nikhil takes the blame for this
 zaaraa nihaal se bahut pyaar karti he par jab vah use kisi or ladki k saath ashleel harkate karte dekh leti he vah usase sambandh tod detii he
 She later forgives him
 nikhil k paas zaaraa or nihaal kaa ek ashleel video he
 Due to which, at the behest of Roshni, Nikhil is using it against him
 zaaraa is isi kaaran pareshaann hokar nihaal se bhi dur rahati he

 Neha's death was blamed on ud's father by the police, accusing Neha of being a drug addict and the death of her
 roshni roy se yudi or gauri ke rishte k bare main pataa karne ke baad is baat ko unke khilaaf istamaal karne kaa nirnay leti he
 Everyone in the group is oblivious to this
 nihaal samooh main wo sadsy he jise photography kaa bahut bada shauk he
 But he derives pornographic images of many girls in the name of photography
 is baat ki khabar jab zaaraa ke paas pahunchataa he vah krodhit hokar usse apna rishta tod detii he
 But later she forgives him
 dharawahik ke pramukh prasang main yah dikhaaya jaataa he kii neha ke snanaghar ke video k peeche zaaraa or nihaal kaa hi haath he
 Nihal does not really love Zara, it is clear
 vah samooh main roy kaa sabase kareebi mitra he
 Roy is a member of the group who cannot spend a moment without drugs or drugs
 vah nihaal kaa priy mitra he
 Roy supports Zara on everything
 jisse yah spasht he ki vah zaaraa ko sachchi mohobat karata he
 But he does not know this thing because he does not want to come between Nihal and Zara
 gauti, gauri kaa chota bhai he parantu vah gauri se puri tarah se alag he
 He is a talented boxer of the college
 vah roshni kii badi bahan neha se prem karata tha
 After Neha's death, she has to repeat a class in college due to not being able to concentrate in her studies

 Gauti becomes someone's friend for the first time after Roshni's admission in college
 vah roshni ko apane pyaar kaa izhaar karata he
 He is going to wait till Roshni's reply by 14 February
 roshni ke bachapan kaa dost or sabase priy mitra
 He accompanies her in every plan of illumination
 nikhil regent college main ek prayogshaala kaa sahaayak he, vah keval roshni ke sahaayta ke liye hi yah naukari kar rahaa he
 Illuminating Nikhil that Saheli has been pretending to be in love with Shivani, so that Shivani does not tell anything to those "five"
 vastav main nikhil roshni se pichley doh saal se pyaar karata he
 The news of this matter is only to Roshni's father, who advises Nikhil to tell Nikhil Roshni about his heart on February 14
 nikhil ko kuch dinon se yah bhi lagane laga he ki raushnee uske pyaar ko zarur apnayegi
 Shivani is her roommate in Roshni's hostel
 vah un "paanch" se bahut darati he
 Shivani is a girl of very timid nature
 parantu roshni ki sachaai jaanane ke baad vah roshni or nikhil kaa saath dena chaahati he
 But she also believes Nikhil's love to be true
 or isi kaaran vah roshni or nikhil ke kareebi dosti se use kabhi-kabhi jalan bhi hoti he

 In it, Hindi hero Dilip Kumar played the role along with other fellow actors
 dharm adheekari internet movie database par For studying the cultural splendor of any cultural land, natural and geographical study of that land is very important
 sanskrit or braj bhashaa ke granthon main braj ke dharmik mahatv par adhik prakaash daalaa gaya he, kintu unamem kuch ullekh rup main kuch prakritik or bhugolic sthit se bhi sambadhit varnan prastut hai
 This mention is made in the works of those devout poets of Braj who resided here after the 16th century and gave their creations
 unamem se kuch mahanubhaavon ne braj ke lupt sthalon or bhuule hue upkarnon kaa anuveshan kar unke mahatv ko punah sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Among such Manish writers, the names of Sarvapri Rupagoswami, Narayanabhatta, Gangwal and Jagatananda are particularly notable
 rupagoswami krit - 'mathura mahtmya', narayanbhatat krit - 'brajbhakti vilaas' or jagatnand krit - 'braj vastu varnan' main is vishay se sambadhit kuch mahatvapurn suchnaayen varnit hai
 The state of Braj is located in the plains of the river Yamuna, generally the construction of land here has been completed by the deposition of soil brought by the Yamuna river
 yahaan kii bhoomi praayah samtal he
 The height of the land here is about 600 feet above sea level
 braj kaa uttari bhaag 600 feet se bhi adhik unchaa he javaki dakshini bhaag 600 feet se kam he at yahaan kii bhoosatah kaa dhalaav uttar se dakshin kii ore he or iske madhya se hokar yamuna nadi kii dhara uttar se dakshin disha kii ore nirantar pravaahit he
 In terms of geographical structure, Braj can be divided into three natural parts - the plains or rocky part and the mountainous part and the Khadar part
 maidani bhaag vistrut he jo yamun nadi ke donon ore purv or pashchim dishaao main failaa hua he
 In ancient times, there were large bays on both sides of the Yamuna in this part, which were very dense, due to which there was excessive rainfall in the Braj region
 us samay yah bhaag atyadhik ramnik or upjau tha
 Due to the continuous cutting of ancient bons, the rainfall has started decreasing here and the spread of the Rajasthani drought-prone desert has started increasing here, which is having a very adverse effect on the climate and yield of the region
 phir bhi yamuna se purv disha vaala maidani bhaag adhik upjau bana hua he kyonki yah domat mitti se nirmit he
 The land in the west-facing plain is sandy and mattiar, so it is less fertile than the loam land in the eastern part
 patharilaa or pahari bhaag braj kii uttari-pashchimi dishaao main he
 Many small hills are situated in this part, which has more religious significance
 haalanki ye naam-maatr kii pahadiyaan hai kyonki inaki vaastavik oonchaai 100 feet ke lagbhag he
 There are no mountains and mountains due to the majority of Braj being in the plains of the river Yamuna
 jaisaa pahile ankit he ki iske pashchimi bhaag main kuch nichi pahadiyaan he, jo aravali parvat shrakhalaon kii tuuti hui sthiti main vidhman he
 These low and ordinary hills are called 'giri' or mountain due to their religious importance
 kavi jagatnand ke varnananusaar braj main 5 parvat yaa pahadiya hai: • Gobardhan • Nandgaon • Barsana • Kamban • Phase • Mound mathura nagar ke pashchim main lagbhag mile kii duuri par yah pahari sthit he
 Its actual elevation is not equivalent to a hill, but due to its unique religious significance it has been described by religious poets and writers as 'giriraj' in their descriptions
 isaki oonchaai lagbhag 100 feet or lambaai 5 mile ke lagbhag he
 Such is the anomaly that its height was very high at first, but it has reduced to such a low surplus
 pracheen brudaavan kaa vistaar thi pracheen kaal main gobardhan tak vistat tha tathaa iske sameep se yamuna nadi pravaahit hoti thi
 While worshiping Mount Gobardhan in Gargasamhita, it has been called the crown of Goloka, residing in Vrindavan and residing in the lap of Vrindavan

 us kaal ke braj-vaasi gana uske nikat apni gaayen charaaya karte the, at ve ukt parvat ko badi shraddha kii drashti se dekhte the
 Lord Krishna stopped the traditional worship of Indra and worshiped Gobardhan in Braj, which was his tribute to its usefulness
 braj ke bhakt mahanubhaavon ne, visheshkar ballab sampradaayi kaviyon ne gobardhan ke prati atyaadhik shraddha vyakt kii he
 The poets of Ashtachhap have given giriraj-govardhan a great description of the natural beauty of radha-krishna, while being the center of the sports of Kali
 chaturbhuj das ne kaha he - vahaan sheethal, mand, sugandhit pawan pravaahit hoti he, sundar jharnaa jharte hai, samast rituon main khilne vaale sundar pushp or fal vidhman rahete hai
 3 other poets have also presented a description of the existing vegetation, panoramic party, flower-fruit and holy waterfalls on its beautiful peaks
 4 During the time of Lord Krishna, there was a severe rain in Braj once due to the wrath of Indra
 us samay sampoorn braj ke jal magn ho jane kaa ashanka utpann ho gai thi
 At that time Lord Krishna had protected all Brajavasis through Govardhan
 bhakton kaa vishwaas he, shri krishna ne us samay govardhan ko chaataa ke samaan dhaaran kar uske neeche samast brajvaasiyon ko ekatra kar liya tha, us alokik ghatana kaa ullekh atyant pracheen kaal se hi puranadi dharmik granthon main or kalakritiyon main hota rahaa he
 5 The devout poets of Braj have made a great statement about it
 6 aajkal ke vaigyanik yug main us alokik ghatana ko usee rup main maananaa sambhav nahin he
 His wise intention is to know that at the time, according to the order of Shri Krishna, Brajwasis took shelter in Govardhan's Kandras and saved their lives from rain
 govardhan ke mahatv kii sarvaadhik mahatvapurn ghatana yah he ki yah bhagwaan krishna ke kaal kaa ek maatr sthir rahane vaala chinh he
 The second sign of that period is also the Yamuna river, but it cannot be called a permanent symbol because of its constant flow
 samast bharatvarsh se lakhon nar-nari prativarsh govardhan ke darshan or uski parikrima karne ke liye aate hai

 gurutvkarshan ek padaarth dwaara ek duusare kii ore aakrisht hone kii pravriti he
 The first attempt to give a mathematical formula about gravity was made by Isaac Newton, which was surprisingly correct
 unhone gurutvkarshan siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Newton's theory was later replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
 isse purv varah mihir ne kaha tha ki kisi prakaar kii shakti hi vastuon ko pruthivi par chipkaae rakhti he
 Modern work on the theory of gravity began in the late 16th and early 17th century with the work of Galileo Galilei
 apane mashhoor prayogon main pisa ke tower se gendon ko chhodane kaa prayog kiya gaya, or baad main gendon ke saavdhaneepurvak maap ke saath incleain ko ghumaya gaya, galileo ne dikhaaya ki gurutvkarshan twaran sabhi vastuon ke liye samaan he
 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa sambandh hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutv niyatank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 german khagolvid kepler ne grahon kii gati kaa adhyayan karke teen niyam diye
 Kepler's first law: - All planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and the Sun is at the focus of those orbits
 dwitiya niyam - kisi bhi grah ko surya se milaane vaali rekha samaan samay me samaan kshetrafal paar karti he
 That is, the regional speed of each planet remains fixed
 arthath jab grah surya se dur hota he to uski chaal kam ho jaati he
 Third law: - The square of the Sun's rotation period of each planet is proportional to the third power of the semi-long axis of its long circular orbit
 gurutvkarshan: "pitaaji, yah prithvi, jis par ham nivas karte hai, kis par tiki hui he?" leelavati ne shatabdiyon purv yah prashn apane pita bhaskaracharya se poocha tha
 In response, Bhaskaracharya said, "bale Leelavati !, some people who say that this earth is based on Sheshnag, Tortoise or Elephant or any other thing, then they are wrong
 yadi yah maan bhi liya jaae ki yah kisi vastu par tiki hui he to bhi prashn bana rahata he ki vah vastu kis par tiki hui he or is prakaar kaaran kaa kaaran or phir uskaa kaaran


 yah kram chalata rahaa, to nyaay shaastra main ise anavastha dosha kehete hai
 Lilavati said, yet the question remains, what is the earth resting on? tab bhaskaracharya ne kaha, kyon ham yah nahin maan sakate ki prithvi kisi bhi vastu par aadhaarit nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 If we say that the earth rests on its own force and call it gravitational force, then what is the fault? is par leelavati ne poocha yah kaise sambhav he
 Then Bhaskaracharya says about the theory that the power of things is very strange
 aage kehete hai- That is, there is attraction power in the earth
 prithvi apni aakarshan shakti se baari padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he or aakarshan ke kaaran vah jameen par girte hai
 But when the same strength came from all around in the sky, how did anyone fall? That is, the planets in the sky remain motionless because the gravitational powers of various planets keep balance

 With the success of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the establishment of communist rule in Russia, which gave the slogan of the best-ever revolution in the world and talked about the end of capitalism, since the birth of capitalist nations considered it their enemy, thus Soviet Union from the beginning
 Fallen from many enemies, Tanushree's harsh and fierce appearance was seen in Stalin's rule, under which the opponents of communism were suppressed and Nag Rick curbed freedom, the movement of people curbed the freedom of expression of newspapers and writers
 In this way, the system of governance of the Soviet Union as the ruler who enjoyed democracy, covered the spirit of the people and not just communist
 At the time of the establishment of the rule, it was said that the dictatorship of the proletariat would be established, but on a practical level, the dictatorship position on the proletariat
 Husband had the Soviet Union established the dictatorship of the party and those in government lentils and government There was no difference between the party and the system of governance
 It started losing public support
 The rigid system established during the rule of Stalin began to reveal the weaknesses of communist rule
 In fact in Eastern European countries where communist rule was present, the people were dissatisfied with their political economic structure and When opposition to the harshness of communist rule in the Soviet Union started increasing, so did the countries of Eastern Europe
 The mistrust of the communist regime began to increase and mass rebellion occurred
 The economic weakness of the Soviet Union also became the reason for its button
 It is a pathetic thing that the economic direction of the Soviet Union was weakened due to financial assistance to the weak countries and the performance of power in the Cold War
 Soviet funds started to be spent on the means of Cold War in place of developmental renovation of the structure
 Heavy rate decline afghanistan main soviet niyantran ke viruddh updrav or grih yuddh lagaataar jari rahe or antatah 1989 main soviet senaayen vahaan se bina apana lakshya puraa kiye laut ain
 Economic difficulties persisted in the country and there were complexities in foreign relations as well

 In December 1991, there was an attempt to disband the state against her ideology but she was crushed
 is ghatana ke baad soviet sangh tut gaya or uske 15 ganatantr sabhi swatantra deshon ke rup main ubhare
 In international treaties, Russia was recognized as the successor country of the Soviet Union
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, antarrashtriya simaaon yaa kshetron ke aar-paar puunji, maal or sevaaon kaa aadan-pradaan he
 
 In most countries, it represents a significant fraction of GDP
 jabaki antarrashtriya vyapaar, itihaas ke adhikansh bhaag main maujuud rahaa he iskaa aarthik, saamaajik or raajnneetik mahatv haal kii sadiyon main badhane laga he
 Industrialization, advanced transport, globalization, multinational corporations and outsourcing have all had a wide impact on the international trade system
 vaishvikaran kii nirantarata ke liye antarrashtriya vyapaar main badhotaree mahatvapurn he
 Without international trade, countries will be limited to goods and services produced within their own borders
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, siddhant rup main gharelu vyapaar se bhinn nahin he kyonki ek vyapaar main shaamil pakshon kii abhiprerana or vyavhaar moulik rup se badalata nahin he bhale hi vyapaar seemaa paar kaa ho yaa nahin
 The main difference is that international trade is generally more expensive than domestic trade
 iskaa kaaran he ki ek seemaa aam taur par atirikt shulk lagaati he jaise prashulk, seemaa par vilamb ke kaaran aavadhik laagat or bhashaa, kanoonee pranali yaa samskruti jaise deshiy bhinnataaon se judi laagtein
 Another difference between domestic and international trade is that production factors such as capital and labor are generally more dynamic within countries than outside
 is prakaar antarrashtriya vyapaar zyaadaatar maal or sevaaon ke vyapaar tak simit he or puunji, shram yaa utpaadan ke anya karkon ke vyapaar main keval ek chote paimaane par
 iske alaava maal or sevaaon kaa vyapaar, utpaadan karkon main vyapaar ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main kaary kar saktaa he
 Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of the factor of production and thus include the related factor
 An example is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China
 Rather than importing Chinese labor, the US is importing goods from China that are produced using Chinese labor
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, arthshaastra kii ek shakha bhi he, jo antarrashtriya vitt ke saath milakar antarrashtriya arthshaastra kii vistrut shakha kaa nirmaan karti he
 Several different models have been proposed to forecast the methodology of trade and to analyze the impact of trade policies such as tariffs
 ricardian model tulanaatmak laabh par kendrit he or antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main shaayad sabase mahatvapurn avadharana he
 In a Ricardian model, countries specialize in the production of the things they produce well
 anya modelon ke vipareet, ricardian dhaancha purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, maal kii ek vistrut shrunkhlaa kaa utpaadan karne ke bajaay visheshgy honge
 In addition, the Ricardian model does not directly consider factor funds, such as the relative amount of labor and capital within a country
 The major advantage of the Ricardin model is that it visualizes technology variations between countries
 praudyogiki antar, ricardian or ricardo-srapha model main aasaani se shaamil hota he 
 The Ricardian model makes the following assumptions: ricardian model laghu-avadhi main maapan karata he, isliye praudyogiki antarrashtriya str par bhinn hoti he
 This supports the fact that countries follow their comparative advantage and allow for specialization
 ricardian vyapaar model kaa adhyayan graham, jones, mekenzi or anya dwaara kiya gaya
 All principles excluded trade input goods such as intermediate goods, commodities and capital goods
 mekenji, jones or samuelson ne jor diya ki vyapaar se madhyavarti vastuon ko baahar rakhe jane se kaaphi laabh kho jayega
 ek prasiddh tippanee main mekenji ne kaha ki "ek pal kaa vichaar ek vyakti ko samajha degaa ki sooti kapade kaa utpaadan karne ke liye lankashair asambhavy hoga, yadi kapaas ko england main ugaana pade
 More recently, it expanded the theory to include the business intermediate case as well
 is prakaar "keval shram" dharna siddhant se nikaal di gai
 Thus the new Ricardian theory, sometimes named the ricardo-sraffa model, theoretically includes capital goods such as machines and materials, traded between countries
 vaishvik vyapaar ke samay main, yah dharna heksher-olin model kii apeksha adhik yathartwaadee he, jo yah maanata he ki puunji, desh ke andar sthir he or antarrashtriya str par gatisheel nahin he
 In the early 1900s, two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Olin, created an international trade theory called the factor ratio theory
 is siddhant ko heksher-olin siddhant bhi kaha jaataa he
 The heckscher-olin theory emphasizes that countries should produce and export goods that require resources that are abundant and must import goods that require short-supply resources
 yah siddhant, tulanaatmak laabh or purna laabh ke siddhanton se bhinn he kyonki ye siddhant ek vishesh vastu ke liye utpaadan prakriya kii utpaadakta par kendrit hai
 In contrast, the heckscher-olin theory states that a country should specialize in production and export using factors that are most abundant and therefore cheap
 Do not produce those goods, as stated by earlier theories, which they produce most efficiently
 heksher-olin model ko buniyadi tulanaatmak laabh ke ricardian model ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Despite its greater complexity, it did not prove to be more accurate in its forecasts
 lekin ek saidhantik drushtikon se dekhne par yah antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main nav-shastreey mulya tantra ko shaamil karke ek suruchipurna samaadhaan pradaan karata he
 This theory argues that the pattern of international trade is determined by differences in factor funds
 yah purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, un maalon kaa niryaat karenge, jo sthaneey rup se prachur karkon kaa upyog karte hai or un maalon kaa aayaat karenge, jo aise karkon kaa upyog karte hai jo sthaneey rup se atyant alp hai
 Empirical problems with the HO model, known as the Leontief paradox, were encountered in empirical tests by Vasily Leontief, who found that the US was exporting labor-intensive goods despite the abundance of capital
 H-O model nimnlikhit mukhya dharanaen banaata he: The problem with HO theory is that it does not involve the trade of capital goods
 In HO theory, labor and capital are constant substances for each country
 ek aadhunik arthvyavastha main, puunjigat vastuon kaa antarrashtriya str par kaarobaar kiya jaataa he
 Trade in intermediate goods benefits greatly, as emphasized by Samuelson
 kai arthshaastri ricardo siddhant kii tulana main heksher-olin siddhant ko pasand karte hai, kyonki yah kam saral dharanaon ko banaata he
 In 1953, Vecily Leontief published a study where he tested the validity of the heckscher-olin theory
 The study showed that the US was more abundant in capital than other countries, so the US was exporting capital-intensive goods and importing labor-intensive goods
 Leontief found that US exports were less capital-intensive than imports
 leontiff virodhabhas ke ubharne ke baad, kai shodhakartaaon ne heksher-olin siddhant ko bachaane kii koshish kii, yaa to maapan ke nae tareekon dwaara, yaa nai vyakhyaaon ke dwaara
 limar ne bal diya ki leontiff ne H-O siddhant kii sahi vyakhya nahin kii or daawa kiya ki ek sahi vyakhya ke saath virodhabhas ghatit nahin hua
 Brecher and Choudary found that, if Leamer was right, the per capita consumption of American workers should be lower than the world average of workers' consumption
 baad main kai anya pareekshan hue lekin unamem se zyaadaatar asafal rahe
 Many well-known textbook authors, including Krugman and Obstfeld and Bowen, Hollander, and VN, are negative about the validity of the HO model
 
 anubhavjanya anusandhan ke lambey itihaas kaa pareekshan karne ke baad, boven, holender or vien ne nishkarsh diya: "kaarak bahutayat siddhant ke haal ke pareekshan jo sidhe HOV samikarnon kii jaanch karte hai, ve siddhant kii asweekruti kaa bhi sanket dete hai"
 :321 The Heckscher – Olin theory has not been well adapted to analyze south – north trade problems
 HO ke anumaan, N-N vyapaar kii tulana main N-S ke sambandh main kam yathartwaadee hai
 The income difference between North and South is the one thing the Third World cares the most
 kaarak mulya samakaran ne vasuuli kaa adhik sanket nahin dikhaaya he
 The HO model assumes that similar production functions between countries
 yah behad avastavik he
 Differentiation of technology between developed and developing countries is a major concern for poor countries
 is model main, udyogon ke bich shram gatishiltaa sambhav he, jabaki alpavadhi main udyogon ke bich puunji sthir he
 Thus, this model can be interpreted as a 'short-term' version of the Heckscher – Olin model
 vishisht kaarak naam, pradaan kiye jane vaale ke liye yah sandarbhit karata he ki alpavadhi main, bhautik puunji jaise utpaadan ke vishisht kaarak udyogon ke bich aasaani se antarneey nahin hai
 The theory suggests that if there is an increase in the price of the goods, then the owners of the factor of production in the specific context of that goods will have real good advantage
 iske alaava, virdohi utpaadan ke vishisht karkon ke maalikon ke paas virdohi kaarysoochee hone kii sambhaavna hoti jab ve shram ke apravas par niyantran ke liye paksh jutate hai
 In contrast, owners of both capital and labor benefit realistically from the increase in capital funds
 yah model vishesh udyogon ke liye adarsh he
 This model is ideal for understanding income distribution but is naïve to discuss the method of trade
 naveen vyapaar siddhant, vyapaar ke bare main kai tathyon ko samajhane kii koshish karata he, jo upar ullikhit do mukhya modelon ke liye mushkil he
 It also includes the fact that most trade occurs between countries with similar factor endowment and productivity levels and the large amount of multinational production that exists

 In the 19th century, especially in the United Kingdom, trust in free trade became paramount
 uske baad se yah dharna pashchimi deshon ke bich prabhavi soch ban gai
 In the years following World War II, controversial multilateral treaties such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization attempted to promote free trade by creating a globally regulated trade framework
 in vyapaar samjhauton ne, anuchit vyapaar ke daavon ke saath jo vikasshil deshon ke liye laabhadaayak nahin hai, aksar virodh or asantosh ko janm diya he
 Free trade is generally the most favored by the most economically strong countries, although they often engage in selective protectionism for industries that are strategically important, such as the US and Europe's imposition of agriculture
 a protective tariff
 The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were staunch advocates of free trade at the time when they were financially influential, today the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan being its biggest supporters
 haalanki, kai anya desh tezi se mukt vyapaar ke himachati banate ja rahe hai kyonki ve aarthik rup se khud adhik shaktishaalee ban rahe hai
 As the tariff level is declining, the desire to discuss non-tariff measures is also increasing, including foreign direct investment, recovery and trade facilitation
 Trade facilitation takes into account customs procedures and transaction costs related to carrying out trade

 During a recession, there is often excessive domestic pressure to increase tariffs to protect domestic industries

 Many economists have attempted to underline tariffs as an internal reason for the collapse in world trade, for which many believe it has exacerbated the recession

 Previous articles have discussed how international businesses need supporting ecosystems and business-friendly policies if they are to succeed in emerging markets
 vishesh mahatv tay he ki ve seoup unke sanchaalan ke liye antarrashtriya kaarobaar kii anumati dene or unhen aage badhane or safal hone ke liye protsaahit karegaa main sarkaron kii bhoomika he
 Often, there is not an option for governments of many countries but they are also known as welcoming international businesses as they need "cash" or dollars
 udhaaharan ke liye, niryaat or aayaat ke bich ke antar ko chaalu khate ke ghate yaa siedi ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Since many emerging markets, the deficit is the ones that need funding with the dollar

 In addition, domestic industry capabilities may not be a particular area nor the expertise to be successful in developing that field
 isliye, epadiai ki kshetra ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he
 In addition, the opening of the economy is necessary for entry into the World Trade Organization or World Trade Organization, which means that in order to export to other countries, to open in emerging markets and developing economies
 in vajahon se vikasshil deshon main kai sarkarein apane-apane deshon main seoup ke sanchaalan ke liye antarrashtriya kaarobaar main videshi nivesh ko protsaahit karne or anumati dene ke kuch kar rahe hai
 However, a host of factors that do not continue the policies of the same governments include the ideological balance of governments, the compulsions of politics, and the fact that foreign investment may not succeed in kick-starting as a planned economy
 it depends on
 yahaan mahatvapurn pahalu yah he ki ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon ke kai sarkarein aksar kyonki uparokt kaarnon kaa khuli bahon se antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat he
 However, through the intervening process, some of them develop cold feet due to policy paralysis, and the factors listed above
 yah samajha ja saktaa he ki antarrashtriya kaarobaar ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon main pravesh karne kii ijaajat di dwidaleey arth he ki vahaan sabhi hitdharakon se is mudde par vyapak sahmati hona chahie hona chahie kii jarurat he
 Only then will international business succeed in emerging market economies
 iske alaava, videshi puunji ke liye pratispardhaa he ki kisi main prakriya par pratikul arthvyavastha or isliye, is prakriya ko jari rakhaa janaa chahie or kaaran protsaahan diya antarrashtriya kaarobaar ko prabhavit karte hai itani teevr he
 Finally, examples from China, Brazil, South Africa, and Vietnam demonstrate the need for a consensus on the opening of economies and following through on this process
 duusari ore, bharat or rus ke udhaaharan ke anya tareeke se in deshon khuli bahon ke saath majaburiyon ke kaaran unki arthvyavasthaaon ko kholaa or phir lekin gati ko banaae rakhane ke rup main asafal aasapaas hai
 This means that integration in the global economy will only take place when the process of reforms is stopped wholeheartedly or without a U-turn

 The fame of Kumaril had spread well in the last period of Harsha
 kumaril ne shabar bhashya par teen prasiddh vrittigranth likhe
 The philosophy of Kumaril can be studied in three main parts - Gyanamimamsa, Tatvamimamsa and Acharamimamsa
 gyaan ke swaroop tathaa uske sadhano kaa kumaril ne vistaar se vivechan kiya he 
 The first question about knowledge is what is the nature of true knowledge or prama - that is, what is seen, smelled, tasted, how does the mind know
 mimasaa ke anusaar, pehle se agyaat tathaa satya vastu ke gyaan ko prama kehete hai
 This knowledge is not obstructed or dismantled by any other knowledge and this knowledge arises for innocent reasons
 jis saadhan dwaara prama athwa yatharth gyaan kii prapti hoti he use pramaan kehete hai
 There are six types of evidence from the opinion of Kumaril - direct, inference, inference, word, economy and unavailability
 advait vedant bhi upyukt chah pramaanon ko sweekaar karata he
 Epistemology considers knowledge to be self-evident
 kumaril ke anusaar gyaan kii pramanikta athwa satyata kii pratiti uske utpann hone ke saath hoti he
 At the time when there is knowledge of an object, at the same time its truth is also known
 uski satyata siddh karne ke liye kisi anya pramaanon kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 But the realization of knowledge's untruth or inauthenticity occurs when it later appears to conflict with the true nature of the object or becomes aware of the faults of the reason causing it
 at: mimasaa gyaan ke vishay main swat:pramanyawad ko maanati he
 According to epistemology , knowledge is the automatic and unproven layer of knowledge 
 kumaril or prabhakar donon hi is mat kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 They accept the existence of external objects
 sansar ko ve advait vedant athwa mahayan buddha darshan kii tarah mithyaa nahin maanate
 The world is true
 sansar kaa tathaa padaarthon kaa man se swatantra astitv he
 By their opinion, there are five types of matter: matter, quality, action, general and absence
 inako ve do bhaagon main vibhajit karte hai : bhav or abhaav
 The first four expressions are called substances
 abhaav ko vaisheshikon kii tarah unhone chaar prakaar kaa mana he : pragabhav, pradhvansabhaav, atyantabhaav tathaa anyonyabhaav
 a substance is one in which the qualities reside
 kumaril ke anusaar yah gyaarah prakaar kaa he : prithvi, jal, vaayu, akaash, aatma, man, maal, dik, andhkaar or shabd
 Of these, the first nine matter are derived from Vaiseshika philosophy
 kumaril ne andhkaar tathaa shabd ko bhi dravya kii hi manyata di he
 In the matter of virtues too, there seems to be a substantial influence of Vaishashika on Kumaril
 prashastpad kii tarah ve bhi 24 gun maanate hai
 These are form, rasa, smell, touch, number, magnitude, separability, coincidence, divination, divinity, immaturity, gravity, fluidity, affection, knowledge, desire, malice, effort, pleasure, sorrow, samskara, sound, nature and power
 gunon kii is suchi main unhone prashastvaad ke shabd ke sthaan par dhwani tathaa dharm or adharm ke sthaan par prakatya or shakti rakhaa he
 Like Vaisheshika, they consider five types: interpolation, deflection, flexion, transmission and movement
 prabhakar ke anusaar karm anumaan kaa vishay he kintu kumaril kaa mat he ki iskaa pratyaksh hota he
 Both Prabhakar and Kumaril believe the general to be true
 unke anusaar iskaa indriyon se saakshaat grahan hota he
 They have complete opposition from the Buddhists in this matter because they do not accept the authority of the general
 kumaril sansar kii utpatti tathaa pralay nahin maanate
 Things continue to be generated and destroyed in the world
 jeevon ke janm maran kaa pravaad chalata rahata he kintu samgr sansar kii na to utpatti hi hoti he, na vinaash
 Like justice, Kumaril does not consider God to be the cause of the world
 anek tarkon dwaara unhone yah siddh karne kaa praytn kiya he ki ishwar ko jagat kaa kaaran maananaa yuktisangat nahin he
 According to Kumaril, the soul is a continual substance
 vah vibhu athwa vyapak he
 He is both the doer and the karma-fruit-bhakta
 aatma sharir, indriya, man tathaa buddhi se bhinn he
 She is not just a child of science
 kumaril ne baudhon ke anaatmavaad tathaa vigyansantan ke siddhant kaa anek prabal tarkon dwaara khandan kiya he
 According to him, the realization of the existence of the eternal soul and the actions of remembrance etc
 cannot be explained
 aatma parinami tathaa nity he
 The soul is partially rooted and partly conscious
 chidansh se aatma vastuon kaa gyaan praapt karata he : achidansh se vah gyaan, sukh, dukh, ichha, praytn aadi ke rup main oupaadhik gun he jo vishesh paristhiti, jaise indriya kaa vishay se sanyog, hone par utpann hota he
 In the state of sleep and salvation, there is no consciousness in the soul
 kumaril ke mat se aatma gyaata tathaa gyaan kaa vishay, donon hi he
 The sentences of the Vedas that i am soul or Brahman, know the soul, confirm this belief
 mimasaa darshan kaa pradhan uddeshy dharm kaa nirupan karnaa he
 According to Jaimini, the symptom of religion is consciousness i
e
 the act of enunciation of action or method of Veda
 mimasakon ke anusaar veda kaa mukhya taatpary kriyaparak athwa vidhivaakyon kaa pratipaadan karnaa he
 There are three types of karma propounded in the Veda: Kamya, Prohibition and Continual Naimittik
 kumaril ke anusaar: * Kamya karmas - are done for the attainment of any desire, like a person who desires heaven will perform a yajna
 *pratishiddh karm - jinka vedon main nishedh mana gaya he
 * Continual Karma - which is considered necessary daily, such as Sandhyavandan etc
 naimitthik karm vishesh avasaron par kiye jate he, jaise shraadh
 a man definitely gets the fruits of his good and bad deeds
 vartmaan main kiye hue yagyadi karmon kaa fal bhavishya athwa janmaantar main kaise praapt hota he? ise samajhane ke mimasak apurv kii kalpana karte he
 According to Kumaril, Apoorva is an invisible force that arises from performing a task
 apurv ke hi kaaran aatma ko apane karmon ke anuroop fal kii prapti hoti he
 This is the invisible link between karma and fruit
 kumaril ke anusaar vedant kaa adhyayan evam chintan mokshaprapti main sahaayak hota he
 The state of salvation ends forever with the soul's body, sense, intelligence and connection to these things of the world
 aatma dukh se purna rup se mukt ho jaataa he
 In that state there is no feeling of happiness either
 yah purna swatantraaa tathaa shanti kii avasthaa he
 In order to attain salvation, one should sacrifice kamya and prohibited deeds
 kintu nity naimitthik karmo kaa sampadan nity karte rahanaa aavashyak he
 The ritual of veditha karmas is the seeker of salvation
