 sanchika sthanantaran protocol ek network protocol hota he jiske dwaara internet aadhaarit tisipi / ypi network par sanchikaon kaa aadan-pradaan kiya jaataa he
 This is used by user based code or anonymous user access
 ab lagbhag har santhaan main apatpi sarwar hone se, yah vyavastha kaam main nahin aati he
 Many recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers

 FTP URL is used in this
 sanchika bhejne ke anya tareeke jaise esaftipi or esasipi apatpi se nahin jude hote

 file transfar protocol yaa apatpi apane vartmaan rup main vibhinn charnon se hota hua pahunchaa he
 It was first formulated as RFC 114 on 16 April 1971 which was later replaced with RFC 765 in June 1980 which was converted from RFC 959 in October 1985
 uske baad anek suraksha sambandhi badlaav isamen aae
 These security changes were brought about because initially this method of sending files was very insecure
 is asuraksha kaa pramukh kaaran tha ki sanchika bhejne kii prakriya main koi bhi usee network par us file ko chura yaa nakal kar saktaa tha
 Prior to HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet, this was a common problem faced by Internet protocols
 is samasya kaa nivaaran esaftipi ke dwaara hi sambhav hua
 FTP can be operated in active mode, passive mode and extended passive mode
 refsi 2428 dwaara sitambar 1998 main, vistrut niskriy mod joda gaya tha
 When transferring data over the network, multiple data representations can be made
 do sarvaadhik saamaanya antaran mod hai: FTP server return codes indicate their status by their inner digits
 mul afatipi vinirdesan, sanchikaon ke antaran kii swaabhaavik asurakshit paddati he, kyonki ancrypted dhang se data antarit karne kii koi nirdisht vidhi nahin he
 This means that under most network configurations, usernames, passwords, FTP commands and transferred files can use any packet detector located on the same network using a packet detector
 yah achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet jaise esasail ke nirmaan se pehle likhe gaye kai internet protocol vinirdeshon ke liye aam samasya rahi he
 The common solution for this problem is SFTP, or FTPS, which adds SSL or TLS encryption to FTP in the manner specified in RFC 4217
 afatipi seva pradaan karne vaala ek host, atirikt rup se anaam afatipi pahunch uplabdh karaane main sakasham hota he
 When asked for a username, users normally log in to an 'anonymous' account service
 yadhyapi aam taur par prayoktaaon ko password ke evaj main apana i-mail pataa bhejne ke liye kaha jaataa he, to aapurit jaankaree kaa satyaapan thodaa-bahut yaa bilkul nahin kiya jaataa he
 Since modern FTP clients typically hide the anonymous login process from the user, FTP clients can supply fake data as passwords because the application may not know the user's email address
 gofar protocol ko or saath hi saadhaaran fil antaran protocol or fil seva protocol ko bhi, anaam afatipi ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main sujhaayaa gaya he
 Where FTP access is not in use, remote or remote FTP or FTP mail is used
 isamen ek email duusare apatpi sarwar par bheja jaataa he jo apatpi cmand puri karata he or downlod sanchika vaali anulgnak waapas bhejtaa he
 This is especially used where FTP access is restricted
 doorvarti afatipi sarwar ko nishpadit kiye jane vaale afatipi cmand yukt i-mail bheja jaataa he
 It is a mail server that parses incoming e-mail, executes FTP commands and sends back e-mails with a file downloaded as an attachment
 yah spasht rup se ek afatipi client se kam lacheela he, kyonki nirdeshikaon ko parsparik kriya karte yaa adeshon ko sanshodhit karte hue nahin dekha ja saktaa he or uttar main bade sanchika anulagnkon ko mail sarwar ke madhyam se nikalne main bhi samasya ho sakati he
 These days most Internet users have easy access to FTP, so this process is not popular in day-to-day use
 vartmaan main aadhunik or haal hi ke web brouzar or file prabandhak, afatipi sarvaron se jud sakate hai, haalanki unamem apatpies jaise protocol vistaar ke liye samarthan kii kami ho sakati he
 This allows the interface, such as the interface used for local files, to be used to switch remote files over FTP
 yah ek afatipi yuarel ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It occurs as: vaikalpik rup se yuarel main password diya ja saktaa he, udaa
: Most web browsers require passive mode FTP, which not all FTP servers are capable of accomplishing
 kuch brouzar keval sanchikaon ko downlod karne kii anumati dete hai, par sarwar main sanchikaon ko aplod karne kaa koi saadhan uplabdh nahin karaate hai
 Representation of port numbers on IP addresses and port commands and PASV reply is another challenge for network address translation tools in dealing with FTP
 eneti upkaran dwaara in maanon ko badalanaa padataa he, taaki ve nat-ed client ke ai-pi pate or data conection ke liye NAT upkaran dwaara chune gaye port ko shaamil karen
 The new address and port may differ from their original address and port in the length of their decimal representation
 iskaa arth yah he ki NAT upkaran dwaara sabhi parvarti packeton ke liye tisipi anukram or pavati fildon ko badalte hue, niyantran conection par maan ko saavdhaanee se badla janaa chahie
 Such translations are not typically performed in most NAT devices, but special application-level gate-ways are available for this purpose
 SSH kii apeksha afatipi ek esaech conection kii apeksha saamaanya afatipi satr ketnal banane ke prayog ko sanderbhit karata he
 FTP uses more than one TCP connection, so tunneling over SSH is particularly difficult
 kai esaech clienton ke saath, niyantran channel ke liye tunnel taiyaar karne kaa prayaas keval channel kii raksha karegaa; jab data sthanantarit hota he, donon chor par afatipi software tisipi conekshnon ko sthapit karenge, jo esaech conection se baahar upmarg par guzarenge or is tarah gopneeyata, akhandta sangrakshan, aadi nahin rahegi
 Otherwise, SSH client software requires specific knowledge of the FTP protocol and monitoring and rewriting FTP control messages and autonomously opening new forwarding for FTP data channels
 esaech sanchaar suraksha ke software parikr kaa sanskaran 3 or jeepiel dwaara licensokrut echoensi, aise do software package hai, jo is vidha kaa samarthan karte hai
 FTP over SSH is sometimes referred to as secure FTP; It should not be considered another method of securing FTP like SSL / TLS
 SSH kaa upyog karte hue sanchikaon ko sthanantarit karne ke anya tareeqon main shaamil hai esafatipi or esasipi, jo afatipi se sambandhit nahin hai; inamen se prayek main, puraa vaartalap hameshaa SSH protocol dwaara surakshit he

 This system remained in force until the Constitution of India came into force

 Accordingly Rajasthan was divided into five divisions and 24 districts, various subdivisions in the districts and tehsils were also formed under them
 rajya kii mul evam pramukh samasya krishi evam bhoomi sudhaaron se sambandhit thi
 At that time, uniform accountability laws and uniform law were the main requirement of the administrative life of Rajasthan, so the land administration of the state had to be reorganized immediately
 is disha main rajasav mandal kaa punargathan kiya gaya
 a revenue board was established for all the unified states of Rajasthan ie Rajputana
 purv samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye rajasthan main shaamil hone vaali riyasaton ke ucch bandobast or bhu-abhilekh vibhaag kaa punargathan evam ekikaran kiya
 At that time there was only one officer of this department who worked in many forms, viz
, Settlement Commissioner, Director of Land Records, Inspector General of Registration and Stamp Superintendent of Rajasthan etc
 ek varsh baad, march 1950 main bhu-abhilekh, panjiyan evam mandra vibhaagon ko bandobast vibhaag se pruthak kar diya gaya
 The Director of Land Records Department was made the ex-officio Inspector General of Registration and Registration
 bhu-abhilekh nideshak kii sahaayta ke liye teen sahaayak bhu abhilekh nideshak niyukt kiye gayi
 All these bodies were formed
 ise rajasav mandal kaha gaya
 Its task was to make decisions at the highest level without fear of revenue promises and bias

 They continued to work until integrated methods were created for the whole of Rajasthan
 1 navambar, 1949 se in rajasav mandalon ne kaary karnaa band kar diya
 The outstanding promises with them were transferred to additional commissioners of the division
 in vaadon main jo apil, purnavyakhya aadi se sambandhit vivaad the, unhen naye rajasav mandal, rajasthan ko punah sthaanantarit kar diya gaya
 Thus the Board of Revenue, Rajasthan became the highest court of appeal revision and reference in revenue matters
 saath hi use bhu-abhilekh prashasan tathaa anya vidhiyon kaa prashasan bhi saunpa gaya
 Most of the revenue officers, being executive officers and courts, act 'bilaterally'

 This was done to protect the interests of poor, illiterate, innocent and remote tenants
 unke liye nyaaypalika or karypalika ko pruthak rakhane kaa suprasiddh 'shakti-pruthakkaran' kaa siddhant bhi ek taraf kar diya gaya

 By keeping in contact with air, its intoxication decreases gradually
 rezin srav pushpit avasthaa main kuch pehle nikalnaa prarambh hota he or garbhaadhan ke baad band ho jaataa he
 Therefore, male plants are sorted out from the fields of Ganja or Charas

 In countries like Bengal, Madhya Pradesh etc
 and in Europe it also comes out in very small amounts
 ganje ke ped yadi bahut paas-paas hon to unamem se charas bhi bahut hi kam nikalataa he
 Some people believe that the shape of hashish originates only from male plants
 garmi ke dinon main ganje ke phoolne se pehle hi iskaa sangrah hota he
 It is gathered by crushing the stalks of the hemp in the Howan squad or scratching it at the time of overdose

 There has been a significant change in the corporate philosophy related to the development of FOSS
 muft software andolan 1983 main launch kiya gaya tha
 In 1998, a group of individuals advocated that the term free software should be replaced by open-source software as an expression that is less ambiguous and more comfortable for the corporate world
 software developers apane software ko open-sorce license ke saath prakashit karnaa chaahate hai, taaki koi bhi ek hi software viksit kar sake yaa iske aantarik kaary ko samaj sake
 With open-source software, one is usually allowed to modify it, port it to the new operating system and instruction set architecture, share it with others or, in some cases, market it

 The open source label came from a strategy session held in Palo Alto on April 7, 1998, in response to Netscape's announcement of the January 1998 Navigator release of source code
 satr main vyaktiyon ke ek samooh main tim o 'reli, linas torwaldas, tom paquin, jemi zawinsky, laire wal, bryan behelendorf, samir paarekh, erik ollman, greg olsan, paul viksi, jon osterhout, gido vine rossom, philip zimarman, jon gillmore or erik es remand
 He used the opportunity before the release of the navigator's source code to clarify possible confusion due to the ambiguity of the word "free" in English
 kai logon ne daawa kiya ki 1969 se internet ke janm ne open sorce movement shuru kiya, jabaki anya open-sorce or free software movements ke bich antar nahin karte hai
 The Free Software Foundation, started in 1985, was intended to be free to distribute the term "free" and not freedom from cost
 chunki muft software kaa ek bada sauda pehle se hi tha muft main, is tarah kaa muft software shunya laagat se judaa hua tha, jo anti-vanijyik lag rahaa tha
 The Open Source Initiative was formed in February 1998 by Eric Raymond and Bruce Peren
 internet develper samudaay dwaara pehle se hi khule vikaas ke vipareet band software vikaas ke maamle ke itihaas se kam se kam 20 saal ke sakshya ke saath, oesai ne netscape jaise vyavsaayik vyavsaayon ko "open sorce" cese prastut kiya
 OSI hoped that the use of the label "open source", a term suggested by Christine Peterson of the Institute of Foresight in the strategy session, would eliminate ambiguity, especially for individuals who consider "free software" to be anti-commercial
 unhone swatantra rup se uplabdh strot code ke vyaavhaarik laabhon ke liye ek ucch profil laane kii maang kii, or ve bade software vyavsaay or anya ucch takanic udyogon ko khule strot main laane ke liye chaahate the
 Peren attempted to register "open source" as a service mark for OSI, but the effort was impractical by trademark standards

 In addition, many of the world's largest open source software projects and contributors, including Debian, Drupal Association, freebsd Foundation, Linux Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Wikimedia Foundation, wordpress Foundation, committed to maintaining osi's mission and open source definition Have done oesai sambhddha samjhaute
 OSI uses open source definition to determine whether this software license considers open source
 paribhaasha dibian free software dishanirdeshon par aadhaarit thi, mukhya rup se parence dwaara likhit or anukulit kii gai thi
 Perence did not base his writing on the "four Freedoms" from the Free Software Foundation, which were later widely available
 parence kii paribhaasha ke tahat, open sorce ek vyapak saamaanya prakaar ke software license kaa varnan karata he jo code ke upyog or sanshodhan par aaraam se yaa astitvaheen pratibandhon ke saath aam janata ko strot code uplabdh karaata he
 This is an obvious "feature" of open source that imposes very few restrictions on the use or distribution by any organization or user to enable rapid development of software
 prarambh main ise sweekaar karne ke baavjood, enneef ke richard stollman ab "open sorce" shabd kaa vyapak rup se virodh karte hai jise ve "muft software" ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai
 Although he agrees that the two terms describe "almost the same category of software", Stallman explains the words wrong and misleading
 stallman open sorce inishiative ke professor vyaavhaarikta kaa bhi virodh karte hai, kyonki unhen dar he ki swatantraaa or samudaay ke muft software aadarshon ko software swatantraaa ke liye enneef ke adarshavaadi maanakon par samjhauta karke dhamkee di gai he
 FSF considers free software to be a subset of open source software, and Richard Stollman explained that DRM software, for example, can be developed as open source, yet it does not give freedom to its users, and thus It does not qualify as free software
 open-sorce software licencing When an author contributes code to an open-source project, they license a clear license or an implicit license already
 kuch open-sorce project license ke tahat yogadan code nahin lete hai, lekin vastav main pariyojna main code yogadan sweekaar karne ke liye lekhak ke copirite ke sanyukt asinament kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Examples of free software licenses / open-source licenses include Apache License, BSD License, GNU General Public License, GNU Lesser General Public License, MIT License, Eclipse Public License and Mozilla Public License
 open-sorce license kaa prasar open-sorce andolan kaa nakaaratmak pahalu he kyonki license ke bich matbhedon ke kanoonee prabhaavon ko samajhnaa aksar mushkil hota he
 With over 180,000 open source projects and over 1400 unique licenses, the complexity of deciding to manage open-source usage within "closed source" commercial enterprises has increased dramatically
 kuch ghar ugaae jate hai, jabaki anya mukhyadhara ke edoeses license jaise barkale software distribution, apache, emiti-style, yaa jienyu general public license ke baad modelling kiye jate hai
 In view of this, open-source practitioners are beginning to use classification schemes in which FOSS licenses are grouped
 open sorce / free software andolan ke liye ek mahatvapurn kanoonee mile kaa pathar 2008 main paarit kiya gaya tha, jab america sangheey apil adaalat ne faisla sunaaya tha ki muft software license nishchit rup se copirite kiye gaye kaam ke upyog par kanoonee rup se badhyakaari sthitiyaan nirdhaarit karte hai, or isliye ve maujuuda copirite kanoon ke tahat lagu hote hai 
 As a result, if the end users violate the licensing terms, their license disappears, meaning that they are infringing copyright

 Open-source software development vikaas model In the 1997 essay The Cathedral and the Bazaar, open-source evangelist Eric S
 Raymond suggested a model for developing an OSS known as the market model
 remand cathedral banane ke liye paaramparik paddatiyon dwaara software ke vikaas kii tulana karata he, "saavdhaanee se alag-alag jaaduugaron yaa shandaar algaav main kaam karne vaale mages ke chote band dwaara taiyaar kii jaati he
 "he suggested that all software should be developed using a market style, which he described as" a huge flurry of different agendas and approaches to the market "
 vikaas ke paaramparik model main, jise unhone cathedral model kaha, vikaas ek kendrikrut tareeke se hota he
 Roles are clearly defined
 bhoomikaaon main dizin karne ke liye samarpit logon, pariyojna ke prabandhan ke liye jimmedaar log, or karyanvayan ke liye jimmedaar log shaamil hai
 Traditional software engineering follows the cathedral model
 bazaar model haalanki, alag he
 In this model, roles are not explicitly defined
 gregorio robles suzav dete hai ki bazaar model kaa upyog karke viksit software ko nimnlikhit pattern pradarshit karnaa chahie: Users should be treated as co-developers upyogkartaaon ko sah-developers kii tarah mana jaataa he or isliye unhen software ke strot code tak pahunch praapt honi chahie
 In addition, users are encouraged to submit additional software, code fixes for code, bug reports, documentation, etc
 adhik sah-develper us dar ko badhaate hai jis par software viksit hota he
 Linus' law states, "all bugs are shallow, seeing enough eyes
 " iskaa arth yah he ki yadi kai upyogkarta strot code dekhte hai, to ant main ve sabhi bag paaenge or suzav denge ki unhen kaise thik kiya jaae
 Note that some users have advanced programming skills, and in addition, each user's machine provides an additional testing environment
 yah nayaa pareekshan vaataavaran us nai bag ko khojane or thik karne kii kshamta pradaan karata he
 Initial release software kaa pehla sanskaran jald se jald jari kiya janaa chahie taaki sah-developers ko jaldi khojane kii sambhaavna bad sake
 continuous integration code parivartanon ko ekikrut kiya janaa chahie jitani baar sambhav ho sake taaki pariyojna jivan chakra ke ant main badi sankhya main bag fiks karne ke upree hisse se bachein
 Some open source projects have built nights where integration is done automatically on a daily basis
 kai sanskaran There must be at least two versions of the software
 adhik suvidhaon ke saath ek buggir sanskaran hona chahie or kam suvidhaon vaale ek adhik sthir sanskaran hona chahie
 The buggy version is intended for users who want to make immediate use of the latest features, and is willing to accept the risk of using code that has not yet been fully tested
 upyogkarta sah-developers ke rup main kaary kar sakate hai, bag kii report kar sakate hai or bag fiks pradaan kar sakate hai
 High modularization software kii saamaanya sanrachana modular honi chahie jo swatantra ghatakon par samanaantar vikaas ke liye anumati de

 Compare with extreme programming
 haalanki, aankade bataate hai ki bazaar model ke mutabik oeses loktantric nahin he

 advantages and disadvantages open sorce software aamtaur par malikana software kii tulana main praapt karnaa aasaan hota he, jiske parinamswaroop aksar upyog main vruddhi hoti he
 Additionally, the availability of open source implementation of the standard may increase the adoption of that standard
 isane develper vafadari banane main bhi madad kii he kyonki developers ko adhikaar mahasoos hota he or ant utpaada ke swaamitv kii bhaavana he
 In addition, OSS requires low marketing and logistics services
 oeses bhi companiyon ko praudyogiki ke vikaas ke baraabar rakhane main madad karata he
 This is a good tool to boost the company's image, including its commercial products
 oeses vikaas drushtikon ne vishwasaneey, ucch gunvattta vaale software ko jaldi or nishpaksh rup se utpaadit karne main madad kii he
 Open source development offers a more flexible technology and the possibility of quick thinking
 ise adhik vishwasaneey mana jaataa he kyonki isamen aamtaur par hajaaron swatantra programmer software kii bag kaa pareekshan or phixing karte hai
 Open source does not depend on the company or author who originally created it
 yahaan tak ki agar company vifal ho jaati he, to code maujuud he or iske upyogkartaaon dwaara viksit kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition, it uses open standards accessible to all; Thus, it does not have the problem of incompatible formats that exist in proprietary software
 yah lacheela he kyonki modular system programmer ko custom interphes banane kii anumati dete hai, yaa isamen nai kshamtaaon ko jodate hai or yah abhinav he kyonki open sorce program badi sankhya main vibhinn programmer ke bich sahyog kaa utpaada hai
 a mixture of different perspectives, corporate objectives, and personal goals accelerate innovation
 iske alaava, muft software puri tarah se takneekee aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar viksit kiya ja saktaa he
 It does not require thinking about commercial pressures which often reduces the quality of software
 vanijyik dabaav paaramparik suraksha developers ko suraksha aavashyaktaaon kii tulana main graahakon kii aavashyaktaaon par adhik dhyaan dete hai, kyonki aisi visheshtaayen graahak ke liye kuch had tak adrishy hai
 It is sometimes said that open source development processes may not be well defined and phases in the development process such as system testing and documentation can be ignored
 haalanki yah keval chote pariyojnaon ke liye sach he
 Big, successful projects define and enforce at least some rules because they need them to make teamwork possible
 sabase jatil pariyojnaon main ye niyam do swatantra developers dwaara maamuli parivartan kii samiksha ke rup main sakht ho sakate hai
 Not all OSS initiatives have been successful, for example Source Exchange and Easel
 software visheshgyon or shodhakarta jo khule strot kii gunvattta pranaaliyon kaa utpaadan karne kii kshamta se aashwast nahin hai, aspasht prakriya, der se dosha kii khoj or kisi bhi anubhavjanya sakshya kii kami ko sabase mahatvapurn samasyaon ke rup main pahachaanate hai
 Designing a commercially sound business model around the open source paradigm is also difficult
 natijatan, keval takneekee aavashyaktaaon ko santusht kiya ja saktaa he na ki bazaar ke logon
 In terms of security, open source can let hackers know about software vulnerabilities or shortcomings, more easily than closed source software
 yah virtual sanghathanon main bhaag lene vaale swytt agenton ke prabhavi pradarshan ko banane ke liye niyantran tantra par nirbhar karata he
 Development tools oeses vikaas main, upkaran kaa upyog utpaada ke vikaas or vikaas prakriya ke samarthan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Consecutive version systems and later revision control systems such as Subversion and Git are examples of tools, often helping to manage open source, source code files themselves, and changes to those files for software projects
 pariyojnaon ko aksar lonchpad, bitbaket or githab jaisi citon par host or prakashit kiya jaataa he
 Open source projects are often systematically organized with "little formal process modeling or support", but utilities such as issuers are often used to organize open source software development
 aam taur par istemaal kiye gaye bagatrackers main bagajila or redmine shaamil hai

 functional test is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hai ki "kya upyogkarta ise kar saktaa he" yaa "kya yah vishesh suvidha kaam karti he"
 Non-functional testing refers to aspects of software that may not be related to a particular function or user action, such as mounting or security
 Non-functional testing answers questions such as "how many people can log in at once", or "how easy it is to hack this software"
 software ke sabhi dosha, code kii trutiyon ke kaaran nahin hote hai
 a common source of costly faults arises due to the expectation interval, for example, unrecognized expectations, which result in deletion errors by the program designer
 apeksha interval kaa ek aam strot, gair-kaaryaatmak apeksha he, jaise pareekshan-kshamta, arohan-kshamta, anurakshan-kshamta, upyog-kshamta, nishpaadan or suraksha
 Software defects occur through the following processes
 programmer ek truti karata he, jo software ke sorce code main ek karaabi main falit hota he
 If this malfunction is performed, in some special cases the system will produce an erroneous result, which will cause a failure
 sabhi dosha aavashyak rup se vifaltaa main parinat nahin honge
 Defects in dead code, for example, will never result in failure
 jab parivesh badla jaataa he, tab ek karaabi vifaltaa main badal sakati he
 Examples of these environmental changes include running the software on a new hardware platform, changing source data, or interacting with different software
 a single error may result in extended symptoms of failure
 aam taur par yah mana jaataa he ki ek karaabi ko jitna pehle khoja jaae, use thik karnaa utana hi sasta hota he
 The following table shows the cost of fixing the malfunction, based on the stage of detection
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi apekshaaon main koi samasya sirf release ke baad saamne aati he, to iskaa kharchaa apekshaaon kii samiksha dwaara hi pataa laga liye jane ke kharche se 10-100 guna adhik hoga
 a common cause of software failure is compatibility with other applications, a new operating system, or, a growing web browser version
 pasch sangatta kii kami ke maamle main, yah isliye ho saktaa he, kyonki programmer ne apane program kii koding yaa software kaa pareekshan sirf, is-or-us oparating system "ke naveenatam sanskaran" par karne kaa vichaar kiya
 An unintended consequence of this fact is that: their latest work may not be fully compatible with the prior mix of software / hardware, or it may not be fully compatible with another important operating system
 kisi bhi sthiti main, ye matbhed, ve jo bhi hon, software vifaltaa main parinat hue honge, jaisaa ki computer prayoktaaon ke kuch mahatvapurn tabake ne mahasoos kiya
 One might consider this to be a "security-oriented strategy" that fits precisely with the latest testing phase suggested by Dave Gelperin and William C
 Hetzel, as cited below
 
 a major problem with software testing is that testing is not possible under all combinations of input and pre-conditions, even with a common product
 iskaa matlab he ki software utpaada main dosha kii sankhya kaaphi adhik ho sakati hai or jo dosha kabhi-kabhi hote hai unhen pareekshan main khojna mushkil he
 More importantly, non-functional dimensions of quality - usability, mountability, performance, compatibility, reliability - can be highly subjective; Something that constitutes sufficient value for one person, unbearable for another
 software pareekshan ke liye kai drushtikon hai
 Review, cross-over, or inspection is considered static testing, while the actual executed program code with a given set of test cases is considered a dynamic test
 static pareekshan ko choda ja saktaa he
 Dynamic testing is used when the program itself is being used for the first time
 dinemic pareekshan, program ke 100% purna hone se pehle code ke vishesh hisson ke pareekshan ke liye shuru ho sakati he 
 Typical techniques for this are using stubs / drivers or execution from a debugger environment
 For example, spreadsheet programs are, by their very nature, mutually tested to a large extent, under which results are displayed immediately after each calculation or text operation
 software pareekshan kaa prayog satyaapan or pramanikaran ke saahchary se kiya jaataa he: The term verification and authentication are commonly used interchangeably in industry; It is also common to misinterpret these two words
 IEEE software ejineering kii maanak shabdaawalee ke anusaar: Software testing can be done by a software tester
 1980 ke dashak tak shabd "software tester" ko aam taur par istemaal kiya jaataa tha, lekin baad main ise ek alag vyavsaay ke rup main dekha gaya
 Various roles related to periods and different goals have been established in software testing: Manager, Test Lead, Test Designer, Tester, Automation Developer and Test Administrator haalanki vivaadaaspad, software pareekshan ko software quality ashurence prakriya ke ek mahatvapurn hisse ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 At SQA, software process specialists and auditors have a comprehensive view on software and its development
 ve software ejineering prakriya kii jaanch karte hai or pradutt software main maujuud dosha: tathakthith dosha dar kii maatra ko kam karne ke liye use hi badal dete hai
 What constitutes an "acceptable defect rate" depends on the nature of the software
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek arched video game main, jise ek hawaii jahaaj udaane kaa abhas dene ke liye dizine kiya gaya he, sambhawatah dosha ke prati apekshaakrit adhik sahansheeltaa hogi, us mishan critical software kii tulana main, jiskaa upyog ek airliner ko niyantrit karne main hota he, jo vastav main ud rahaa he
 Although there are close associations with SQA, testing departments often operate independently and may not have SQA functions in a company
 software pareekshan, ek computer program ke apekshit parinaamon ko, die gaye ek input set ke liye, iske vaastavik parinaamon se tulana karte hue, software main dosha kaa pataa lagane ke uddeshy se kiya gaya kaary he
 Paradoxically, QA is the implementation of policies and procedures aimed at preventing errors from occurring
 software pareekshan tareeqon ko paramparaagat rup se blike box pareekshan or white box pareekshan main vibhajit kiya gaya hai
 Both of these approaches are used to describe the approach that a test engineer adopts for designing test cases
 blike box pareekshan, software se ek "blike box" ke rup main vyavhaar karata he - bina kisi aantarik karyanvayan kii jaankaree ke blike box pareekshan tareekon main shaamil hai: equivelens partishning, boundry vailu enelysis, ol peyars pareekshan, faj pareekshan, model-besd pareekshan, tresebility metrics, exploretary pareekshan or spacification-aadhaarit pareekshan
 Therefore, black box testing has the advantage of "an unsympathetic opinion" on the one hand and a "blind search" on the other
 white box pareekshan tab hoti he jab pareekshak ke paas, aantarik data sanrachanaon or ise lagu karne vaale code sahit elgoridam tak pahunch sulabh hoti he
 They both return a code coverage metric, measured as a percentage
 grey box pareekshan main shaamil he aantarik data sanrachanaon or elgoridam tak, pareekshan maamalon ko dizin karne ke liye pahunch, lekin upyogkarta, yaa blike box str par pareekshan
 input data kaa parivartan or output ko formet karnaa, grey box ke tahat nahin aata, kyonki input or output us "blike-box" se spasht rup se baahar he, jise ham pareekshan ke tahat system kah rahe hai
 This difference is particularly important when performing integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers, where only the interface is presented for testing
 haalanki, ek data bhandar ko sanshodhit karnaa zarur grey box ke antargat aata he, chunki aam taur par upyogkarta pareekshan ke tahat system ke baahar data badalane main sakasham nahin hoga
 Gray box testing may also include reverse engineering, for example, to determine the bounding value or error message
 pareekshanon ko aksar, software vikaas prakriya main unke shaamil hone kii jagah ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, yaa pareekshan kii vishistataa ke str dwaara
 Unit testing refers to tests that verify the functionality of a particular section of code, usually at the process level
 ek object-unmukh parivesh main, yah aksar shrenee str par hota he or nunatam ikai pareekshan main shaamil hota he constructor or distractor
 These types of tests are typically written by developers when they are working on code to ensure that a particular process is working properly as expected
 code main corner caces yaa anya shakhaon ko pakadaney ke liye, ek prakriya main kai pareekshan ho sakate hai
 Unit testing, alone, cannot verify the functionality of a piece of software, but is used to ensure that the building blocks used by the software function independently of each other
 integration pareekshan kisi bhi prakaar kaa software pareekshan he, jo ek software dizin ke prati ghatakon ke bich interphes ko satyapit karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Software components can be integrated iteratively or together
 aam taur par pehle vaale tareeqe ko ek behatar abhyaas mana jaataa he, chunki yah interfes muddon ko twarit rup se sthaneey hone or thik hone kii anumati detaa he
 Integration testing works to expose errors in interfaces and to show interactions between integrated components
 uttarottar, architektural dizin ke tatwon ke anuroop jaanche gaye software ghatakon ke bade samoohon ko ekikrut or tab tak jaancha jaataa he, jab tak software ek system ke rup main kaam naa karne lage
 System testing tests a fully integrated system to verify that it meets its requirements
 system integration pareekshan yah pushti karata he ki ek system, system aavashyaktaaon main paribhaashit kisi bhi bahari yaa anya paksh ke system se ekikrut he
 Regression testing focuses on finding faults after a major code change
 vishesh rup se, yah software pratigaman ko yaa puraane bag jo waapas aa gaye hai, unhen ujagar karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Such regressions occur whenever the software process, which was previously working correctly and now stops working as expected
 vishisht rup se, pratigaman, program parivartan ke ek anpekshit parinaam ke rup main ghatit hote hai, jab software kaa nav viksit hissaa, pehle se maujuud code ke saath takaraata he
 Common methods of regression testing include replaying previously run tests and checking if previously corrected errors have reappeared
 pareekshan kii gaharaai, jari prakriya main charan par nirbhar karti he or atirikt visheshtaon ke jokhim par
 ve yaa to purna ho sakate hai, release main kaaphi der se jode gaye parivartanon ke liye yaa phir jokhim bhare, bahut uthle tak, prayek suvidha par sakaaratmak pareekshan se bane hue, agar badlaav, relies main jaldi ho rahe hai yaa kam jokhim vaale samajhe jate hai
 Acceptance testing can refer to one of two: alpha pareekshan, sambhavit upyogkartaaon / graahakon yaa develper kii site par ek swatantra test team dwaara nakli yaa vaastavik sanchaalan pareekshan he
 Before the software went into beta testing, alpha testing is often used as a form of internal acceptance testing for off-the-shelf software
 beta pareekshan alpha pareekshan ke baad aata he
 The software version, known as the beta version, was released to a limited clientele outside the programming team
 software ko logon ke samoohon ke liye jari kiya jaataa he, taaki aage ke pareekshan yah sunishchit kar saken ki utpaada main nunatam kharabiyaan yaa bag hai
 Sometimes, the beta version is made available to the open public to increase the response area to the maximum number of prospective users
 software ke gair-kaaryaatmak pahaluon ke pareekshan ke liye vishesh tareeqe maujuud hai
 Unlike functional testing, which establishes the correct operation of software, non-functional testing confirms that the software functions properly even when it receives invalid or unexpected input
 software folt injection, fajing ke rup main, ek gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan kaa udhaaharan he
 Non-functional testing, specifically for the sake of software, is designed to establish whether the construct under the test can tolerate invalid or unexpected input and thus the input validation routine as well as the error - Will be able to establish the strength of the handling routine
 vibhinn vanijyik gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan upkaran, software folt injection prishth se jude hote hai; kai khule strot ke or muft software upkaran uplabdh hai, jo gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan karte hai
 Performance testing, or load testing, checks to see if the software can handle large amounts of data or users
 aam taur par ise software scalebility ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This activity of non-functional software testing is often referred to as a capability test
 sthaitv pareekshan yah dekhne ke liye jaanch karata he ki software ek sweekaarya avadhi main yaa usase upar, lagaataar acchhee tarah se kaary karata saktaa he yaa nahin
 This activity of non-functional software testing is often referred to as load testing
 prayojyata pareekshan kii jarurat yah jaanchane ke liye hoti he ki yuzar interfes kaa upyog karnaa or use samajhnaa aasaan he yaa nahin
 Security testing is required for software that refines confidential data to prevent system intrusion by hackers
 anterrashtriyakaran or sthaniyakaran kii jarurat software ke in pahaluon kii jaanch ke liye hoti he, jiske liye ek chhadmasthaniyakaran vidhi kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 This will confirm that the application works even after being translated into a new language or adapted to a new culture
 vinaashak pareekshan, software yaa up-pranali ko isaki majbootee ke jaanch ke liye, vifal karne kaa prayaas karti he
 a common method of software testing is performed by an independent group of testers, before it is sent to the client and after its functionality is developed
 is abhyaas ke parinamswaroop aksar pareekshan charan kaa, pariyojna main hui deree kii kshatipurti ke liye pariyojna bafer ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he or is prakaar se pareekshan ke liye samarpit samay ke saath samjhauta hota he
 Another practice is to start software testing from the moment the project starts and it is a continuous process till the completion of the project
 jawaab main, kuch aise ubharate software vishay jaise extream programing or azeil software development andolan, ek "test driven software development" model kaa paalan karte hai
 In this process, unit tests are first written by the software engineer
 Of course these tests initially fail; As expected from them
 or phir jaise hi code likhaa jaataa he yah pareekshan sweet ke bade ansh ke sanwarddhit rup se gujarata he
 Test suites are constantly renewed and integrated with any developed regression test due to new failure conditions and corner cases
 baaki software sorce code ke saath unit test ko banaae rakhaa jaataa he or aam taur par bild prakriya main ekikrut kiya jaataa he 
 Although variation exists between organizations, there is a specific cycle for testing
 nimna namoona, water fall deveopment model ko apnaane vaale sanghathanon ke bich aam he
 Many programming groups are relying more and more on automated testing, especially such groups that use jotest driven development
 test likhane ke kai fremawork hai or satat ekikaran software, pareekshan ko swatah chalaaegaa, jab har baar code ek varjan control system main parkhaa jayega
 While automation cannot build everything that a human can, it can be very useful for regression testing
 tathaapi, vastav main upyogi hone ke liye, isamen script pareekshan kii ek purna viksit test sweet kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Program testing and fault detection can be greatly assisted by test equipment and debuggers
 pareekshan / dibg upkarnon kii visheshtaon main shaamil hai: Some of these properties can be incorporated into an integrated development environment
 aam taur par, jin vishyon tak gunvattta simit hoti he, ve hai shuddhta, sampoornataa, suraksha, lekin ISO maanak ISO 9126 ke tahat varnit adhik takneekee aavashyaktaaen bhi shaamil ho sakati hai, jaise kshamta, vishwasaneeyata, dakshata, suvahyata, rakh-rakhaav, sangatta or 0}prayojyata
 Several common software measures exist, often called 'metrics', which are used to measure the software's condition or test adequacy
 software pareekshan prakriya kai artiffact ko utpann kar sakati he
 Several certification programs exist to bolster the professional aspirations of software testers and quality assurance specialists
 vartmaan main pradaan kiye jane vaale pramann main aisa koi nahin he, jisamen vastav main aavedak ke liye software pareekshan kii kshamta ko pradarshit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 No certification is based on a widely accepted framework of knowledge
 is tathy ne kuch logon ko yah kehane ke liye prerit kiya ki pareekshan kshetra abhi pramann ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Certification alone cannot measure a person's productivity, their skills, or practical knowledge and cannot guarantee their ability as an examiner, or professional style
 kuch pramukh software pareekshan vivaadon main shaamil hai: Bhanpokhara NZA is a village in Nainital district of Kumaon division under Uttarakhand state of India in Dhari tehsil

 ek hezhog eulipotyphlan parivaar Erinaceidae main subfamily Erinaceinae ke kisi bhi chote stanadhariyon main se ek he
 The five species contain seventy species of hedgehogs, found through introduction in Europe, Asia and parts of Africa, and New Zealand
 australia ke mul nivasee nahin hai, or america ke mul nivasee jivit prajatiyaan nahin hai 
 Hedgehogs share distant ancestors with shorts, with Jiminor possibly being the intermediate link, and little has changed in the last 15 million years
 pehle stanadhariyon main se kai kii tarah, unhone jivan ke ek ratribhoj ke tareeke ko anukulit kiya he
 The spiny defenses of hedgehogs look like unrelated porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme
 naam hezhog varsh 1450 ke aasapaas upyog main aayaa, jo madhya angreji hegoge se, hegg, hej se liya gaya tha, kyonki yah hegarjos, or hoge, hog ko apane piglic snaut se aksar karata he
 Other names include urchin, hedgepig and furze-pig
 hezhog ke samooh ke liye samuhik sangya sarani he
 Hedgehogs are easily identified by their spines, which are hollow hairs that harden with keratin
 unki katai jahrile yaa baadhit nahin hoti he or ek porcupin ke kwills ke vipareet, aasaani se apane sharir se alag nahin hoti he
 However, the spines of immature animals are generally replaced with adult spines
 ise "qwilling" kaha jaataa he
 Spins can also shed when the animal is diseased or under extreme stress
 ek raksha he ki hejahogon kii sabhi prajatiyon main ek tang gend main role karne kii kshamta hoti he, jisase sabhi katai baahar kii ore ishaara karte hai
 The hedgehog has two large muscles in its back that control the position of the quills
 jab praani ko gend main ghumaya jaataa he, to peeche kii chakkidaar takaraae hue chehre, pair or pet kii raksha karti he, jinhen thanda nahin kiya jaataa he
 Since the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the number of spines, some desert hedgehogs that develop to carry less weight are more likely to run away or even attack, to the intruder with the spines; Twisting into a shiny ball is a last resort for that species
 vibhinn prajatiyaan vibhinn shikariyon ke shikaar hai: jabaki van hezhog mukhya rup se pakshiyon or ferrets ke shikaar hote hai, lambii prajatiyon kii tarah choti prajatiyaan lomadee, bhediye or mongos kaa shikaar hoti hai
 Hedgehogs are mainly nocturnal, although some species may also be active during the day
 hezhog din ke ek bade hisse ke liye jhaadiyon, ghaas, chattaanon, yaa aamtaur par jameen main khudaai main ghaney daagon main sote hai, prajatiyon ke bich alag-alag aadaton ke saath
 All wild hedgehogs can hibernate depending on temperature, species, and abundance of food, although not all do
 hezhog kaaphi mukhar hai or prajatiyon ke aadhaar par grunts, snuffles or / yaa squeals ke sangyojan ke madhyam se samvaad karte hai
 Hedgehogs sometimes perform a ritual called abhishek
 jab jaanavar ek nai khushboo se muqabla karata he, to vah strot ko chaatna or kaat degaa, phir uske munh main ek sugandhit frath banaayegaa or ise apni jeebh se apni katai par paste karegaa
 The purpose of this habit is unknown, but some experts believe that tampering the hedgehog with the region's newfound smell and providing a source of potential poison or infection to predators afflicted by their spines
 pakshiyon main samaan vyavhaar kii vajah se abhishek ko kabhi-kabhi anting bhi kaha jaataa he
 Like opossums, mice, and moles, hedgehogs have some natural immunity against some snake venom via the protein erynacin in the animal's muscle system, although it is only available in small amounts and a wiper bite can still be fatal
 iske alaava, hezhog chaar gyaat standhari samoohon main se ek hai jo utparivartan ke saath hai jo ek or saanp jehar, α-neurotoxin ke khilaaf suraksha karte hai

 ve sangh ke atyant samarpit or pakke sadsy the
 He was very interested in the affairs of the Union
 sangh ke sadsy ke rup main unka aacharan ek udhaaharan tha or unhone swayan ko sabakaa priy bana liya tha
 In the eighth year of the membership of the Sangh, an incident occurred which became tragic for Shuddhodan's family and a critical situation was created in the life of Siddhartha
 shaakyon ke rajya kii seemaa se sata hua coliyon kaa rajya tha
 The Rohini River was the dividing line of the two states
 shakya or coliya donon hi rohinee nadi ke pani se apane-apane khet sinchate the
 They used to dispute between each crop on who would use Rohini's water first and how much
 ye vivaad kabhi-kabhi jhagade or ladaaiyon main badal jate the
 When Siddhartha was 28 years old, there was a fight between Shakya and the servants of Kolis over Rohini's water, injuring people on both sides
 jhagade kaa pataa chalane par shaakyon or coliyon ne sochaa ki kyon na is vivaad ko yuddh dwaara hameshaa ke liye hal kar liya jaye
 The commander of the Sakyas called a session of the Shakya Sangha to consider the question of declaration of war against the Kolis and proposed war to the Union

 These five men together solve the quarrel
 siddharth kaa prastaav bahumat se amaanya ho gaya saath hi shakya senapati kaa yuddh kaa prastaav baari bahumat se paarit ho gaya
 Unable to resolve the dispute with Shakya Sangha and Shakya Senapati, Siddharth eventually had three options

 Even in this work, he became more proficient than his teachers, but he could not find answers to his questions yet
 fir unhone kuch saathi ikaithe kiye or chal diye adhik kathor tapasya karne
 Doing so, after six years, without getting answers to their questions, having passed through death due to hunger, they started thinking of doing something else

 samyak drushti : chaar arya satya main vishwaas karnaa 2
 samyak sankalp : maansik or naitik vikaas kii pratigya karnaa 3

 The theory of pratyatamutpad states that any event exists in a complex cause-and-consequence web only because of other events
 praaniyon ke liye, iskaa arth he karm or vipaak ke anusaar anant sansar kaa chakra
 Because everything is eternal and eternal, nothing really exists

 But elsewhere Buddha has called the supreme truth indescribable

 The Sangh occupies a large place in Buddhism
 is dharm main buddha, dhamm or sangh ko 'triratn' kaha jaataa he
 Regarding the rule of union, Gautama Buddha said that small rules can make monks change
 un ke mahaparinirvana pashchaat sangh kaa aakaar main vyapak vruddhi hua
 After this growth, different people became attached to Buddha religion on the basis of different region, culture, social stage, initiation, etc
 and the rule of the Sangh started changing gradually
 saath hi main angutar nikaay ke kalam sutt main buddha ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par dharm paalan karne kii swatantrata di he
 Therefore, due to scandal / change in the law of Vinaya, local cultural / linguistic aspect, freedom of individual religion, more or less added to the definite side of religion, due to various reasons, various sects and associations in Buddha religion were scrapped
