 This rebellion lasted for two years in different regions of India
 is vidroh kaa aarambh chhavnee kshetron main choti jhadpon tathaa aagjanee se hua tha parantu janvari maas tak isane ek bada rup le liya
 The end of the revolt coincided with the end of the East India Company's rule in India and the British Crown's direct rule over the whole of India began for the next 90 years

 The victory in these two wars greatly increased the strength of the British and proved their military capability superior to the traditional Indian military capability
 company ne iske baad saare bharat par apana prabhaav failaana aarambh kar diya
 In 1843, the East India Company took possession of the Sindh region after a bloody battle

 san 1857 ke vidroh ke vibhinn rajnatik, aarthik, dharmik, sainik tathaa saamaajik kaaran bataaye jate he Many historians believe that there was a belief in the public at that time that the British want to Christianize them by force or deception
 yah puri tarah se galat bhi nahin tha, kuch company adhikari dharm parivartan ke kaary main jute the
 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he
 Earlier, one of the reasons for the decline of the Portuguese from India and Japan in the sixteenth century was that they had tried to force Christianity on the masses
 lord dalhousie kii rajya hadapney kii naati ke antargat anek rajya jaise jhansi, avadh, satara, nagpur or sambalpur ko angreji rajya main mila liya gaya or inke uttaradhikari raja se angreji rajya se pension paane vaale karmchaaree ban gayi
 The royal families, zamindars and armies found themselves unemployed and marginalized

 bhartiya, company ke kathor shashan se bhi naaraaz the jo ki teji se fail rahaa tha or pashchimi sabhyta kaa prasar kar rahaa tha
 The British outlawed many of the customs of Hindus and Muslims at that time which were considered antisocial by the British
 isamen sati pratha par roak lagaana shaamil tha
 It is worth noting here that the Sikhs had stopped this long ago and the famous social reformer of Bengal, King Rammohan Roy was campaigning in favor of discontinuing the practice

 The British judicial system was considered unjust to Indians
 san 1853 main britain ke pradhanmantri lord abradin ne prashasnic seva ko bharatiyon ke liye khol diya parantu kuch prabud bharatiyon ke hisaab se yah sudhaar paryaapt nahin tha
 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy
 in nitiyon ke kaaran bahut se kisaan, karigar, shramik or kalakaar kangaal ho gayi
 Along with them the situation of the landlords and big farmers also got worse
 san 1813 main company ne ek tarafa mukt vyapaar kii niti apana lee iske antargat britani vyapaariyon ko aayaat karne kii puri chhot mil gayi, paramparaagat takanic se bani hui bhartiya vasteen iske saamne tik nahin saki or bhartiya shahari hastshilp vyapaar ko acolpaneey kshati hui
 With the arrival of the railway service, small enterprises in the rural areas were also destroyed
 rail seva ne britani vyapaariyon ko dur daraaj ke gaavon tak pahunch de di
 The textile industry suffered the most
 iske saath loha vyapaar, bartan, kaanch, kaagaj, dhaatu, bandook, jahaaj or rangareji ke udyogon ko bhi bahut kshati hui
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Indian exports came to an end due to import tax and many barriers in Britain and Europe
 parmparik udyogon ke nasht hone or saath saath aadhunik udyogon kaa vikaas na hone kii kaaran yah sthiti or bhi visham ho gayi
 The general public has no means other than farming

 In the beginning of British rule, the peasants were left at the mercy of the zamindars, who greatly increased the rent and started exploiting the peasants by forced labor and other methods
 company ne kheti ke sudhaar par bahut kam kharch kiya or adhiktar lagaan company ke kharchon ko puraa karne main prayog hota tha
 In the event of crop failure, the moneylenders loaned the farmers more interest and cheated the illiterate farmers in many ways
 britani kanoon vyavastha ke antargat bhoomi hastantaran vaid ho jane ke kaaran kisaanon ko apni bhoomi se bhi haath dhonaa padataa tha
 Due to these problems there was dissatisfaction among every section of the society
 san 1848 or 1856 ke bich lard dalhoji ne doctrin ouf laps ke kanoon ke antargat anek rajyon par adhikaar kar liya
 According to this theory, a state, territory or area of british influence will become subject to the company, if the king of the region dies without permission or the ruler is disqualified in the eyes of the company
 is siddhant par kaary karte hue lard dalhoji or uske uttaradhikari lard cannig ne satara,nagpur,jhansi,avadh ko company ke shashan main mila liya
 Political credibility of the company was also questioned due to the treaties and promises made by the company
 san 1849 main lard dalhoji kii ghoshnaa ke anusaar bahadur shah ke uttaradhikari ko aitihaasik laal kila chhodana padega or shahar ke baahar janaa hoga or san 1856 main lard cannig kii ghoshnaa ki bahadur shah ke uttaradhikari raja nahin kahalaayenge ne mughalon ko company ke vidroh main khada kar diya
 The soldiers were originally soldiers of Indian origin who worked in the company's Bengal Army

 This army had more soldiers than the British army
 san 1857 main is sena main 2,57,000 sipaahi the

 parantu bengal presidensi kii sena main bhartee hone vaale sainik mukhyat: avadh or ganga ke maidani ilaako ke bhoomihaar brahman or rajput the
 In the early years of the company, caste privileges and customs were given importance in the Bengal Army, but after 1840, after the coming of modern government in Calcutta, there was a fear of losing the caste among the soldiers
 sena main sipaahiyon ko jati or dharm se sambandhit chinh pahanane se manaa kar diya gaya
 In 1856, under an order, all newly recruited soldiers were made mandatory to work abroad for some time

 The salary of the army was low

 The modern system of firing in the new gun was used, but the process of firing in the gun was old
 nayi enfield bandook bharne ke liye kaartoos ko daanton se kaat kar kholana padataa tha or usame bhare hue barud ko bandook kii nalee main bhar kar kaartoos ko daalana padataa tha
 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he
 This was against the religious sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers
 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai
 The then British Army Chief George Enson, bypassing the advice of his officers, solved the problem arising out of this exercise and new gun

 According to General Jan Heyerseye Mangal Pandey was in some kind of religious madness
 The General ordered Jamadar Ishwari Prasad to arrest Mangal Pandey but the Zamidar refused
 sivaay ek sipaahi shaikh palatu ko chhod kar sari regiment ne mangal pandeya ko giraftaar karne se manaa kar diya
 Mangal Pandey told his comrades to openly rebel but when no one believed, he tried to take his life with his gun
 parantu ve is prayaas main keval ghayal huye
 Mangal Pandey was court martialed on 6 April 1857 and hanged on 8 April

 All regiments were abolished and soldiers were expelled

 On 9 May, 85 soldiers were court martialed by the military court, most of the soldiers were sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment

 The captive soldiers were tied in their beds and stripped in uniform and paraded in front of the army

 Some Indian soldiers reported to the British officers a plan to forcibly release the detainees, but the top officials ignored it

 There were many protests in the market and arson incidents took place

 Some officers and their families escaped to Rampur and took shelter at the Nawab of Rampur

 The same morning 3 Bengal Light Cavalry reached Delhi

 Bahadur Shah did not say anything at that time, but other people present in the fort supported the rebels

 Many European officials, their families, Indian converted Christians and traders were also attacked by soldiers and rioters

 Bahadur Shah was worried about these events but finally announced his support and leadership to the soldiers

 pracheen kaal me gwaala yaa gopal kahe jane vaale hindu ahiron ko kalantar main muslim dharm apnaane ke baad me ghosi kaha jane laga
 But in practically any religion or caste, a Gule is called Ghosi
 samanytah ye kaha ja saktaa he ki koi bhi musalmaan jo gwaala ban gaya use ghosi kaha jane laga or kalantar me yah naam kisi bhi ahir yaa gwaale ke liye prayukt hone laga, isiilie, hindu ahiron va unke muslim pratidwandeeyon donon ko sanyukt rup se ghosi kaha jaataa he

 But in Sagar and Damoh areas, the aspiration for Kshatriva is so strong that if anyone wants to ask his caste, then the practical question is done in this way - "which Thakur are you?" "mainpuri settalment report" ke anusaar- uttar pradesh ke mainpuri ilaake me ahir ek prabhutv-sampann jati he, ghoshiyon sahit unki aabaadi ilaake kii kul aabaadi kaa 16

 isamen koi andeh nahin ki prarambh main yah vikraymoolya ke sadrush yaa anuroop tha lekin islam kaa aarambh hone ke baad ise vivaah sambandhi sambhog kaa mulya samajhnaa thik nahin jaan padataa
 Arabic memorialists have compared it to Vikramulya because it is considered a civil contract in the Muslim system
 islam ke purv arab main vadhoomulya ko, jo uske matapita ko dey tha, mahar kehete the tathaa jo dhan stri ko aadar or snehasuchak uphaar ke rup main diya jaataa tha use sadak kehete the
 The difference between the two was understood
 islam ne mahar ko stri ke paksh main ek vaastavik vyavastha ke rup main parivartit karne kaa praytn kiya
 It was a curb on the arbitrary exercise of the husband's boundless right to divorce as an instrument for the day and socially
 pati ko apni stri ko talaak dene par sampurna mahar raashi tatkaal dey hogi
 The modern enlightened belief about Mahar is that Mahar is not a reward for marriage, but to show respect for a woman, there is an obligation placed on her husband by law
 isaki pushti is tathy se ho jaati he ki vivaah ke samay mahar kaa savistaar ullekh na hone par bhi vivaah kii vaidhaniktaa par koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 If the mahar was bride-price then it would have been illegal in the absence of reward for contracting to provide mahar after marriage
 lekin aisa pratigyaptr vaid or balpurvak pratipaadan yogya hota he
 As husband Mahr, any amount can be fixed for her woman, even if it is more than her ability and even after giving this amount, nothing can be left for her heirs
 lekin vah kisi bhi sthiti main 10 daraham se kam kii vyavastha nahin kar saktaa
 Mahar provides the entire amount mentioned in the contract unless the method of a section assembly is contrary
 bharatvarsh ke musalamaanon ke pati dwaara stri ko talaak dene se bachaane ke liye mahar praaia: unchaa hota he
 In the event of divorce, he will have to give the sanctioned amount and the argument that the sanctioned amount is excessive or outside the husband's power will not be sufficient to avoid giving it to the wife
 nyaayalay mahar kii dhanrashi nishchit karne main apni ichha kaa tabhi prayog kar saktaa he jab dhara sabha kii vidhi dwaara use adhikaar praapt ho
 Only the proper consideration of the husband's power and the position of the woman will be the deciding fact in deciding the amount
 ullikhit mahar vivaah ke pehle, vivaah ke avasar par yaa uske baad nishchit kiya ja saktaa he or vaivaahik jivan ke antargat isamen vruddhi kii ja sakati he
 If the husband is a minor, then the mahar can be decided by his father and given by the husband
 shiya logon main prachlan he ki yadi ladkaa apni stri ko mahar dene main asamarth rahaa to pita vyaktigat rup se mahar dene kaa uttaradaayi hota he
 If the amount of Mahr is not fixed, then the wife is the right of Mahr or the officer of Mahremisal
 kya uchit mahar he iskaa nishchay karne main iskaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki uske pita ke parivaar main striyon ko, jaise uske pita kii bahanon ko, kitna kitna mahar mila he
 Since mahr is an inherent right of a wife, it should be received on her demand and this prompt is called mahr
 lekin kabhi kabhi mrityu se yaa talaak se vivaah ke viched par mahar dey hota he or yah deverd mahar kaha jaataa he
 The immediate mahar can be taken by the wife at any time after marriage, whether the marriage is complete or sure
 vivaah ke samay yadi yah nishchit nahin hua ho ki mahar taatkaalik he yaa asthgit, to shiya vidhi ke anusaar vah taatkaalik samajha jayega
 Although Sunnis consider it to be partly instantaneous and partly deferred, the ratio of the two will be based on the position of the custom or common side
 patni api ichha se mahar yaa iskaa koi bhaag apane pati yaa uske uttaradhikariyon ke paksh main chhod de sakati he
 This abandonment is valid even if it is not without reward
 yah aavashyak he ki vah parityag uski apni swechha se uske dwaara kiya gaya ho
 The wife has the right to receive it unless the mahr has been abandoned, although the marriage is contracted on the condition that she will not demand any compensation
 jab tak ki taatkaalik mahar na diya jaae patni pati ke paas janaa asweekaar kar sakati he
 If the husband submits a suit against him for rendering marital relations, then the refusal of the mahar is a sufficient defense for the wife and the suit will be dismissed
 duusari ore yadi mahar nahin diya jaataa to patni yaa uski mrityu ke baad uske uttaradhikari iske liye us tithi se jabaki taatkaalik mahar kii maang kii gai ho, yaa vah asweekaar kiya gaya ho, yaa jab mrityu yaa talaak ke kaaran vaivaahik sambandh viched hua ho, uske teen varsh ke bheetar, vaad prastut kar sakate hai
 The heirs of the deceased Muslim are not personally responsible for giving the Mahar
 lekin mrit vyakti se pai hui sampatti ke apane hisse ke anupaat main ve uttaradaayi hote hai
 The mahar is in the form of a loan and the widow is entitled to pay the deceased husband's other mahajans with her property from her property, but her right does not exceed the right of the unsecured mahajan
 yadi uske adhikaar main uske pati kii sampatti ho jise usne vaid rup se bina dhokhe ke yaa dabaav ke mahar ke badale main hastgat kiya ho ki vah kiraye or munaafe se swatv kii santushti kar sake, to vah apane pati ke duusare uttaradhikariyon ke viruddh us kabja ko tab tak kaayam rakh sakati he tab tak ki mahar ke swatv kii santushti na ho jaae

 However, they have nothing to do with the competition of other firms, as they are separated only after the initial bid
 badi pariyojnaon main atyadhik jatil vittiya yojanaayen shaamil ho sakati hai
 When parts of a project are completed, they can be sold, replaced by others by a lender or owner, while materials for each stage of the construction project can be carried forward to the right trades and materials transportation needs 
 kai angreji-bhashi deshon main, lekin sanyukt rajya america nahin, pariyojnaon main aamtaur maatra sarveyyaron kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 legal considerations ]]mukhya lekh : Construction law a construction project must fit the official legal framework of the property
 inamen sampatti ke upyog par sarkari niyam or daayitv shaamil hote hai, jo nirmaan kii prakriya ke dauraan nirmit hote hai
 The project has to comply with segmentation and building code requirements in the areas
 jis pariyojna main code kaa paalan karne main vifaltaa hasil hoti he, usamen maalik ko phayda nahin hoga
 kuch kanoonee aavashyaktaaen agyaat kaarnon se paidaa hoti hai yaa pul ke gir jane yaa visphot jaise nirvivaad kharaab sthitiyon se nipatane kii ichha ke dauraan padati he
 Other legal requirements may arise from possible conditions and things, such as custom or expectation, such as the separation of commercial buildings into a commercial district and residential buildings into a residential district
 a lawyer may ask for a change or exemption in the applicable law in the country where the building is to be constructed, such as he may argue that this rule is unenforceable, or that custom laws are not required
 ek nirmaan pariyojna anubandhon or anya kanoonee dayitvon kaa ek jatil jaal he, jinamein se prayek par dhyaan se vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 ek anubandh do yaa adhik partiyon ke bich dayitvon ke ek set kaa vinimay he, lekin yah itnaa aasaan maamla nahin he ki ek paksh duusare paksh ko jitna kam sambhav ho, utane ke vinimay par zyada se zyada ke liye sahamat karne kii koshish kare
 nirmaan main samay tatv kaa matlab he ki der hone se laagat badhati he or baadhaon ke maamalon main der bahut mahangi pad sakati he
 Thus, the contract should be done in such a way as to ensure that each party is capable of discharging its obligations
 The contract should have a clear description of the expectations and a clear path to meeting those expectations to achieve the result of a smooth transition of the project, while a poor contract draft causes confusion and may eventually collapse

 Design should not only be structurally superior and convenient for use and location, but construction should be economically feasible and free from legal conflicts

 There are many different methods of construction procurement, although the three most common types of procurement are: traditional design and construction contact management kharid ke nae roopon kii sankhya bhi bad rahi he, jisamen sambhddha anubandh shaamil hota he or jahaan ek nirmaan pariyojna ke bheetar mukhya maalik, thekedaar or anya hitdharakon ke bich sahakaari sambandhon par jor hota he
 New forms include partnerships such as public-private partnerships aka private finance initiatives and alliances such as "pure" or "project" alliances and "impure or" strategic "alliances
 sahyog par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa makasad kai samasyaon ko dur karnaa hota he, jo nirmaan udyog ke bheetar aksar atyadhik pratispardhi or pratikul gatividhiyon ke kaaran paidaa hoti hai
 Traditional Main article: Design-bid-build is nirmaan kharid kaa sabase aam tarika he or acchhee tarah se sthapit or manyata praapt he
 In this arrangement, the engineer or architect serves as the project coordinator
 uske yaa uski bhoomika kaam kii dizin karnaa, vinirdeshon taiyaar karnaa, nirmaan kii drawing pesh karnaa, anubandh prashasan, kaam shuru karnaa or shuru se lekar aakhir tak kaam kaa prabandhan karnaa he
 The architect has a direct contractual relationship between the client and the main contractor
 kisi upathekedaar kaa mukhya thekedaar ke saath ek sidhaa sanvidatmak sambandh hota he
 Design and construction Main article: Design-build yah drushtikon haal ke varshon main kaaphi aam ho gaya he or isamen fikschar, fitting or anya aavashyak upkarnon sahit samoochaa purna package shaamil hota he, jisase ek puri tarah kaaryaatmak imaarat taiyaar hoti he
 In some cases, the design and construction package includes applications to search for the site, arrange funding and obtain all necessary statutory consents
 maalik ek pariyojna kii aavashyaktaaon kii ek suchi pesh karata he or pariyojna ke lakshyon kaa ek samgr drushtikon saamne rakhata he
 Many D&B contractors have different views on how to meet these goals
 maalik apni pasand ke sabase achche vichaaron kaa chayan karata he or upyukt thekedaar ko kaam detaa he
 Often, there is not just one contractor, but several contractors working together

 When they are working on Phase 1, they design Phase 2
 yah dizin bid-bilt anubandh ke vipareet he, jahaan pariyojna kii dizin puri tarah se maalik dwaara banaayi jaati he or tab boli lagati he or nirmaan puraa kiya jaataa he
 Director of the Engineering for the National Asphalt Pavement Association Kent Kinsen said that the government's transportation departments usually use design-build contractors to complete projects if governments do not have the funds
 In DOTS, design-build contracts are commonly used for large projects
 prabandhan pranaaliyon kii kharidmukhya lekh : Construction management In this arrangement, the customer plays an active role in the procurement system by entering into separate contracts with the designer architect or engineer construction manager and individual business contractors
 graahak sanvidatmak bhoomika apanaataa he, jabaki nirmaan yaa pariyojna prabandhak alag vyapaar anubandhon ke prabandhan ke liye sakriy bhoomika adaa karata he or yah sunishchit karata he ki ve sabhi sucharu rup se or prabhavi rup se ek saath kaam karen
 Management procurement systems are often used to speed up procurement processes, giving the customer greater flexibility to design changes throughout the contract, giving it the ability to appoint individual work contractors, throughout the contract During each individual has a separate contractual obligation and this gives the customer greater control

 Around 4500 BC in Mesoamerica
 But probably more than 11,000–10,000 BC
 a group of similar events first appeared although the term "pre-classic" has been used here instead of the late Neolithic to Middle Era and the paleo-indian word for the Early Neolithic and the paleo-indian for the postwar period
 Although these cultures are not generally considered to belong to the Neolithic

 There is little scientific evidence of the evolving social stratification of most Neolithic societies; Social stratification is largely associated with the later Bronze Age

 However Neolithic societies were generally markedly more hierarchical than earlier Paleolithic cultures and hunter-gatherer cultures

 However, there is still considerable controversy over the evidence of social inequality as settlements such as the Catal Huyuk suggest a vast reduction in the size difference of homes and burial sites, indicating a more egalitarian society with no evidence of the concept of capital
 However, some houses appear to be slightly larger and more elaborately furnished than other houses

 Theories that explain the explicit implicit egalitarianism of Neolithic societies have been constructed, the most notable of which is the Marxist concept of primitive communism

 In the Paleolithic era people generally did not live in permanent constructions

 The development of agriculture has resulted in the construction of permanent houses

 An important and far-reaching change in human livelihoods and lifestyles was to cultivate the areas where the cultivation of crops was first introduced: essentially the nomadic hunter-gatherer pre-dependence on livelihood technology or pastoral infertility was first met and followed
 Later, it was replaced by dependence on food produced from farms
 It is also believed that these developments had a significant impact on the development of settlements as it may be believed that the increasing need to spend more time and effort to prepare the accounts required more localized housing

 The deep differences in human interaction and livelihood practices associated with early agricultural processes in the Neolithic era have been called the Neolithic Revolution, a term coined by the Australian archaeologist Vere Gordon Childe in the 1920s

 The Neolithic peoples of the Levant, Anatolia, Syria, northern Mesopotamia, and Central Asia were also accomplished builders who used clay bricks to build houses and villages

 As Shri Shivaditya has written in the book Saptapadarthi, doubt is called uncertain knowledge or doubtful experience
 tarksangrah ke anusaar sanshay vah gyaan he jisamen ek hi padaarth anek virdohi dharmo yaa gunon se yukt prathit hota he 
 For example, when we look at a remote pillar in the dark, we cannot know for sure that it is a pillar, then our mind becomes oscillating and we begin to accuse that one of the two different religions of matter and manhood in matter
 na to ham nishchaypurvak yah kah sakate hai ki vah padaarth stambh he or na yah ki vah manushya he
 Such a paradoxical, dichotomous, undecided or alternative state of mind is called doubt
 yah avasthaa na keval gyanabhav tathaa bhram yaa vipareet gyaan se hi kintu yatharth nishcitt gyaan se bhi bhinn hoti he
 Therefore, according to the principle called Skepticism, definite knowledge or its possibility is denied
 is siddhant ko purna rup se maananevaale vyaktiyon ke vicharanusaar maanav ko kabhi bhi or kisi bhi prakaar kaa vaastavik yaa nishchit gyaan nahin ho saktaa
 In the opinion of skeptics, the structure of our brain or mind is such that through it we can never be able to know the true nature of the world or its substances
 sanshaywad ko angl bhashaa main scaptisism kehete hai
 Sapteshism is said to have originated in the year 440 before Christ, from the rationalists called the Sophists of Greece
 parantu unka sanshaywad saamaanya rup kaa tha
 As a systematic theory, it began with the famous thinker of Alice, Piro, three hundred years before Christ
 piro ne vaastavik gyaan ko spasht shabdon main asambhav batalaaya he
 Timon of Philius was his principal disciple
 piro ke kuch anuyaayiyon ne to, jinamein sextus ampiricas kaa naam visheshtya ullekhneey he, sanshayvadi vishwaas ko is seemaa tak nibhaayaa ki ve swayan is baad ko bhi sanshay kii drushti se dekhne lage
 According to these skeptics, all our griefs, compounded by desires and disappointments, originate from the inadequacy of our consultations on matter
 madhyakaalin paashchaatya sanshaywaadiyon main pascal tathaa aadhunik sanshaywaadiyon main hum adhik prasiddh he
 Pascal said that no definite or satisfactory theory of the world can be established by intelligence and Hume sir has confined our ability to know only to the empirical field
 unke anusaar manushya ko apane andriya anubhav ke baahar kii baat jaanane yaa kehane kaa koi adhikaar nahin
 Some thinkers also include the famous German philosopher Chorn in the skeptics; But it is more appropriate to call them agnostic rather than skeptical, because they have revealed the real or conventional nature of things as unknowable or unknowable by intellect, not suspicious
 or kam se kam kaaryjagat ko samaj sakane kii kshamta to unhone buddhi main maani hi he
 The mention of some skeptics of Bharatvarsha is found in some Buddhist texts like "shramaniyaphalasutra" etc
 udaahranarth, ajitkesakambali naamak ek vichaarak kaa kahana tha ki yatharth gyaan kabhi sambhav nahin or gaekwad oriental siries main prakashit "tattavopallavasingh" naamak pandulipi ke lekhak shri jayrashi ne kisi bhi pramaan ko, yahan tak ki pratyaksh pramaan ko bhi, asandigdh gyaan kaa saadhan nahin mana
 Sometimes some people also understand the skepticism of Jain philosophy, propounded by the words "syadasti Syat Nasati"
 parantu vastut: syadwad pratipaadit "syat" shabd kaa prayog tattat vaakya kii sandigdhta kaa nahin kintu use satya kii saapekshata kaa dyotak he
 The truth, condition and context of the advisories or decisions to the taste is acceptable
 chaahe sanshaywaadee swayan kuch bhi kahen, sanshay kii maansik avasthaa koi sukh kii avasthaa nahin hoti 
 And to be completely skeptical is not only difficult, but impossible
 swayan sanshaywad kii sweekruti hi uski manyata kaa khandan kar detii he
 If there is no definite knowledge of any kind, then how can it be said with certainty that any kind of definite knowledge is not possible
 yaa to sanshaywad kii manyata asamichin he yaa phir swayan sanshaywad "vadatovyaghaat dosha" se dooshit siddh hota he
 Furthermore, every single function of our practical life depends on the recognition of the definite knowledge of the substance or person concerned
 vah sanshaywad ko purnataya maan lene par chal hi nahin saktaa
 That is why in the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, the words "sambhayatma Vyasanti" etc
 have made Skepticism inadmissible
 parantu, saath hi saath, yah maanane se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki aparikshit paramparaagat manyataon kii andh sweekruti bhi vichaaron ke vikaas main baadha daalati he
 Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to look at commonly accepted so-called truths for doubt, as enlightened Shri Vachaspati Mishra said, skepticism gives rise to curiosity and curiosity is desirable for knowledge
 or kaant mahoday kii yah ukti ki hum ke "sanshaywad ne mujhe vaicharik roodhiyon kii nidra se jagaa diya", is satya ko pramanit karti he
 But it is exactly the same to color the intellect or mind with a skeptical complexion and doubt everything, as if they are constantly and continuously washed by a lunatic, even when there is no dirt in the hands
