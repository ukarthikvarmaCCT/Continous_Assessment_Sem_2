 Therefore, the canals bring about multi-faceted development and along with the growth of agriculture in the irrigated area, they also progress in the industry and help in raising the standard of living of the people
 prashasan ko bhi acchhee naharon se rajasav kosh main aamadani ho jaati he, jaise upree or nichali ganga naharon se uttar pradesh prashasan ko san 1958-59 main lagbhag 1

 Canals are man-made water flow systems that are of two types: 1
 Aqueduct : jo krishi yaa maanav upyog ke liye istemaal hoti hai
 Fresh water is also flowed as needed
 2
 Waterway canals : ye naharen yatayaat main kaam aati hai
 Ships and boats carry passengers or goods through the use of these canals
 ye naharen maujuuda jhiilon, nadiyon or samandaron ko joda karti hai
 Like the famous Suez and Panama canals
 The word canal is originally a Persian word
 netherlands ke shaharon main shahar kii naharen gracht bhi kehalaati hai
 The special thing in the construction of irrigation canals is that these canals are taken through such paths, where water may flow to both sides of the canals for irrigation
 at: nahar kaa bahaav sinchit kshetra ke antargat unchi se unchi bhoomi par hokar niojit kiya jaataa he
 The river and drainage, in contrast, flow from the bottom to the bottom of the area
 vastav main naharen bahudhaa do nadiyon yaa naalon ke madhya ucch bhoomi par hokar hi nikalati he
 Somewhere the canals have to cross many rivers and streams to reach this high ground
 udhaaharan ke liye, upree ganga nahar ko apane udgam sthaan haridwar or rudki ke bich lagbhag 20 mile ke faasale main chaar pahari nadiyon ko paar karnaa padataa he or vah bhi bhinn-bhinn rup se
 In fact the paved road runs along the Upper Ganges Canal from Roorkee to Haridwar and these 20 miles provide an opportunity to see some important engineering works
 do sthanon par nahar pahari nadiyon ko neeche se paar karti he ek jagah nadi nahar main mila lee jaati he or ek anya jagah, solani aquidct par, nahar nadi ke upar hokar guzarati he
 Solani Aqueduct is world famous
 yah mahatvapurn kaary, sirf eenton or chooney se, lagbhag 1850 i

 As the irrigation canal progresses, it becomes smaller like branches of trees
 iske vipareet nadiyaan jaise-jaise aage badhati hai, badi hoti jaati hai or unki sahaayak nadiyaan tathaa naale unamem milte rahete hai
 Branches originate from distribution canals or roads and small canals, called minor or bumblebees, emerge from them
 in sab naharon se kulabe, moudhe yaa out let dwaara pani kheton ke liye nikaala jaataa he
 All this distribution is compatible with scientifically determined principles
 yadi aisa na kiya jaae to naharon main, jo saikadon mile tak pani pahunchaati hai, pani hi na pahunche
 For this, government departments are established in which skilled engineers are appointed to keep the canals in good condition and to run prescribed amount of water in them
 naharon main pani bhi aisi gati se chalaaya jaataa he ki usase nahar main na to kataav ho or na talachat hi jamaa ho
 Wherever required, the falls are made so that the slope of the bottom of the canal can be kept in the prescribed condition
 is disha main bahut gaveshna kaary bharat main hua he or hota rahata he
 Many other problems arise in the operation of canals, the responsibility of the engineers remains to be solved
 naharon main aavashyaktaa ke anusaar nikaas bhi banaae jate hai, jinke dwaara aavashyaktaa na rahane par yaa kisi tut-foot ke samay, atirikt pani sameepvarti nadi yaa naalon main nikaala ja sake
 It is often said that the canal is running full and there was heavy rainfall in that area, which led to zero demand for betel water
 aisi avasthaa main moghe yaa kulabe band kar dene padate hai
 But the entire water cannot be fed by a canal, so it becomes mandatory to drain the water into the river or drains
 jahaan nahar adhik bharaav main hokar banaai jaati he vahaan nahar ke donon kinaaron ke pushte badi saavdhaanee se banaae jate hai
 For example, the Upper Ganges canal passes through Roorkee in a heavy fill on either side of the Solani aqueduct
 vahaan bharaav 35 foot tak kaa he, arthath donon ore kii bhoomi kaaphi nichi he
 There are pucca flowers, which are about three miles in length
 kintu phir bhi pani kaa risaav tali main se hota he jisko sametane ke liye donon ore naaliyaan bani hui hai, jinamein rison kaa pani jamaa hokar nadi main chalaa jaataa he
 There is also a lot of loss due to leakage from canals somewhere
 naharon ke banane se saamaanya bhugarbha jalatal unchaa ho jaataa he
 If the capacity of water leaks in the surrounding land is reduced, then there is a state of waterlogging and the cultivable land starts to become agricultural
 at: naharon ke nirmaan ke saath-saath nikasi naalon kaa nirmaan aavashyak ho jaataa he
 If these measures are not taken in time, there is a possibility of huge loss, as has happened in some areas of Punjab
 naharon ke saath-saath naalon kaa nirmaan anivaary he
 In many areas of the world, due to lack of proper drainage of water, canals have resulted in loss rather than profit
 kahin kahin rison rokane ke liye naharon kii tali or donon tateey parshvon kaa concrit yaa chunaai se athwa anya sadhano se pakkaa kar dete hai
 It reduces water leakage
 yah niti visheshkar usee kshetra main safal hoti he jahaan sinchai nahin hoti or nahar keval pani ko aage le jane ke liye bani hoti he
 However, where irrigation is done, this means does not prevent waterlogging for a long time, it is imperative to work carefully with careful landings and drainage drains or additional drainage tips below the ground

 Seeing his contribution in the field of novels, the famous novelist of Bengal, Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay, addressed him as novel Samrat
 premchand ne hindi kahani or upanyaas kii ek aisi parampara kaa vikaas kiya jisane puri sadi ke sahitya kaa maargdarshan kiya

 His early life was a struggle because his mother died at the age of seven and his father died at the age of fourteen
 unka pehla vivaah un dinon kii parampara ke anusaar pandrah saal kii umr main hua jo safal nahin rahaa
 He was influenced by the Arya Samaj, which was a major religious and social movement at that time
 unhone vidhwaa-vivaah kaa samarthan kiya or 1906 main doosraa vivaah apni pragatisheel parampara ke anuroop bal-vidhwaa shivarani devi se kiya
 They had three children - Sripat Rai, Amrit Rai and Kamala Devi Srivastava
 1910 main unki rachana soje-vatan ke liye hamirpur ke jila colector ne talab kiya or un par janata ko bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 All copies of Soje-watan were confiscated and destroyed
 colector ne nawabrai ko hidaayat di ki ab ve kuch bhi nahin likhenge, yadi likhaa to jail bhej diya jayega
 By this time Premchand used to write under the name Dhanpat Rai

 His first available writing is his Urdu novel Asrar Maabid
 premchand kaa doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 This was followed by Premchand's first story collection called soze-watan which was published in 1908
 soje-vatan yani desh kaa dard
 Fueled by patriotism, it was banned by the English government and warned its author not to do such writing in future
 iske kaaran unhen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa
 His first story titled 'premchand' was published in the December 1910 issue of Bada Ghar Ki Beti Zamana magazine
 maranoparant unki kahaniyaan maansarovar naam se 8 khandon main prakashit hui
 The story said that Emperor Premchand said that the litterateur is not the truth behind patriotism and politics, but rather the truth which shows the torch before him
 yah baat unke sahitya main ujagar hui he
 In 1921, he quit his job at the call of Mahatma Gandhi
 kuch maheene maryaada patrika kaa sampadan bhaar sambhala, chah saal tak maadhuri naamak patrika kaa sampadan kiya, 1930 main banaras se apana masik patr hans shuru kiya or 1932 ke aarambh main jaagran naamak ek saptahik or nikaala

 Wrote the story of a film titled Mazdoor, released in 1934, and without completing the year-long period of contract, escaped to Benares, leaving two months' salary because he did not like the air and water of the film world in Bombay and more
 unhone mul rup se hindi main 1915 se kahaniyaan likhnaa or 1918 se upanyaas likhnaa shuru kiya
 Premchand wrote a total of nearly three hundred stories, about a dozen novels and many articles
 unhone kuch naatak bhi likhe or kuch anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Many literary works of Premchand were translated into many languages including English, Russian, German
 godaan unki kaaljayi rachana he
 Kafan is believed to be his final story
 unhone hindi or urdu main puure adhikaar se likhaa
 Most of his compositions originally written in Urdu, but they went first publication was in Hindi
 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit
 Premchand's composition and vision came in various literary forms
 bahumukhi pratibha sampann premchand ne upanyaas, kahani, naatak, samiksha, lekh, sampadakeey, sansmaran aadi anek vidhaon main sahitya kii sristi kii
 He was prominently known as a storyteller and during his lifetime he was awarded the title of 'novel Emperor'
 unhone kul 15 upanyaas, 300 se kuch adhik kahaniyaan, 3 naatak, 10 anuwaad, 7 bal-pustaken tathaa hajaaron prishthon ke lekh, sampadakeey, bhaashan, bhoomika, patr aadi kii rachana kii lekin jo yash or pratishtha unhen upanyaas or kahaniyon se praapt hui, vah anya vidhaon se praapt na ho saki
 This situation appears equally in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 premchand ke upanyaas na keval hindi upanyaas sahitya main balki sampurna bhartiya sahitya main mile ke pathar hai
 Premchand first begins his novelist in fiction
 unka pehla urdu upanyaas ‘asaraare maaabid urf devsthan rahasy’ urdu saptahik ‘'aawaaj-e-khalq'’ main 8 oktober, 1903 se 1 farvari, 1905 tak dharawahik rup main prakashit hua
 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute
 dow ramvilas sharma ke anusaar 'sevasadan' main vyakt mukhya samasya bhartiya nari kii paradheenata he
 After this came his first novel 'premashram' on peasant life
 iskaa masauda bhi pehle urdu main 'goshaae-aafiyat' naam se taiyaar hua tha lekin 'sevasadan' kii bhaanti ise pehle hindi main prakashit karaayaa
 'premashram' is probably the first novel in Hindi written on peasant life
 yah avadh ke kisaan andolanon ke daur main likhaa gaya
 After this, the journey through 'rangbhoomi', 'rejuvenation', 'nirmala', 'drone', 'karmabhoomi' was completed to 'godan'
 rangabhumi main premchand ek andhe bhikhaari surdaas ko katha kaa nayak banaakar hindi katha sahitya main krantikari badlaav kaa sutarapaat kar chuke the
 Godan has an important place not only in Hindi literature but also in world literature
 isamen premchand kii sahitya sambandhi vichaardhaara 'aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad' se 'aalochanatmak yatharthwaad' tak kii purnataa praapt karti he
 Creating a common peasant hero of the novel was like to change the course of the novel tradition
 samantvaad or poonjeevaad ke chakra main funskar hui kathanayake hori kii mrityu pathakon ke jahan ko jhakzor kar rakh jaati he
 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 This can also be seen in his last period stories
 'mangalsutra' premchand kaa adhuraa upanyaas he
 The original story of Premchand's novels was Indian rural life
 premchand ne hindi upanyaas ko jo oonchaai pradaan kii, vah parvarti upanyaaskaaron ke liye ek chunauti bani rahi
 Premchand's novels were translated into many languages of India and the world, especially his most popular novel Godan
 inaki adhiktar kahaniyon main nimna va madhyam varg kaa chithran he
 Dr
 Kamalkishore Goenka has published the entire hindi-urdu story of Premchand under the name Premchand Kahani Rachnavali
 unke anusaar premchand ne kul 301 kahaniyaan likhi hai jinamein 3 abhi aprapya hai
 Premchand's first story collection titled Soze Vatan was published in June 1908
 isi sangrah kii pehali kahani duniya kaa sabase anmol ratan ko aam taur par unki pehali prakashit kahani mana jaataa rahaa he
 According to Dr

 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya
 'premchand: Miscellaneous Context' edited by Amritrai is actually a compilation of Premchand's articles

 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya
 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill

 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe
 Most of Premchand's compositions tell the story of his poverty and poverty

 He became a hero in his creations, which Indian society deemed untouchable and disgusting
 unhone saral, sahaj or aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa kaa upyog kiya or apane pragatisheel vichaaron ko dridhtaa se tark dete hue samaaj ke saamne prastut kiya
 Presiding over the first conference of the Progressive Writers Association in 1936, he said that the writer is progressive by nature and he who is not, is not a writer
 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed and only 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But later on, readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement
 premchand ne hindi main kahani kii ek parampara ko janm diya or ek puri peedi unke kadamon par aage badi, 50-60 ke dashak main renu, nagarjun auki inke baad shrinath singh ne gramin parivesh kii kahaniyaan likhi hai, wo ek tarah se premchand kii parampara ke taratamya main aati hai
 Premchand was a revolutionary creator, he saw not only patriotism but also many evil practices prevalent in the society and put them before the people through the story
 unhone us samay ke samaaj kii jo bhi samasyaayen thim un sabhi ko chitrit karne kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 Dalits also come in it, women also
 ye sabhi vishay aage chalakar hindi sahitya ke bade vimarsh bane
 Premchand is one of the most popular writers of Hindi cinema

 Pressure is usually between 6 and 18 cm of water; Pressure is usually increased in bacterial meningitis
 In kryptococal mastishk fever main antahkapaly daab kaaphi badha hota he
 The initial form of the liquid can be indicative of the nature of the infection: staining CSF indicates that protein, white and red blood cells and / or bacterial levels are high and therefore may cause bacterial meningitis
 CSF namoonay kaa pareekshan shwet rakt koshikaon, laal rakt koshikaon, protein maatra or glucose str kii upasthiti va prakaar ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Gram staining of the specimen may exhibit bacteria in bacterial meningitis, but the absence of bacteria does not exclude the possibility of bacterial meningitis as they appear in only 60% of cases; If antibiotics were given before the sample was taken, this figure is reduced by 20%
 gram staning bhi lysteriosis jaise sankramanon main kam vishwasaneey he
 Microbiological culture sampling is more sensitive but results take up to 48 hours to be available

 Snowflake prevalence in less common cases suggests that it is caused by parasites or fungi, among other reasons
 CSF main glucose kii adhikta aam taur par rakt kii tulana main 40% upar hoti he
 It is generally lower in bacterial meningitis; The glucose level of CSF is thus divided by blood sugar
 ≤0
4 kaa anupaat bacteria janit mastishk fever kaa sanket ho saktaa he; navjaat main CSF main glucose kaa str aam taur par ucch rahata he or 0
6 ke neeche kaa anupaat asaamaanya mana jaataa he
 Lactate in CSF indicates a high degree of likelihood of bacterial meningitis, just like a high number of white blood cells
 yadi lactate str 35 mg / dl se kam hon or vyakti ne pehle koi antibiotic na liya ho to yah bacteria janit mastishk fever hone kii sambhaavna ksheen karata he
 Other special tests can be used to identify different types of brain tides separately
 latex aglutination pareekshan streptococas neumonia, nieseria meningitidis,haemophiliz infuenza, eskerishia kolior group bi stryptocoki ke kaaran hone vaale mastishk fever main sakaaratmak ho saktaa he; iskaa niyamit prayog protsaahit nahin kiya jaataa he kyonki iske kaaran upachaar main parivartan bahut kam hote hai lekin ise tab upyog kiya ja saktaa he jab duusare pareekshan nidaan na kar paa rahe hon
 Similarly, the Limulus Lycate test may be positive in gram-negative bacterial meningitis, but is limited to the extent that other tests have been helpful

 It can identify bacteria in bacterial meningitis and can be helpful to find out the difference in various cases of meningitis caused by viruses
 serology virus janit mastishk fever main upyogi ho saktaa he
 If tuberculous meningitis is suspected, the sample has low sensitivity to Zeil Nelson Stenzis and tuberculosis culture, which takes longer; The use of PCR is increasing
 CSF par indian ink sten kaa upyog karke kryptococal mastishk fever kaa nidaan kam laagat par kiya ja saktaa he; halanki rakt yaa CSF main kryptococal antigen kaa pareekshan adhik samvedansheel hota he vishesh rup se AIDS peedit logon main
 Where there are symptoms of meningitis after taking antibiotics, "partially treated meningitis" is a diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty
