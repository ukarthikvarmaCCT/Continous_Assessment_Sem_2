 It is proven by experience that Turkish children need twice the hover space as compared to chicken
 ek din ke bacchon kii brooding inphra red balbon yaa gas bruder kii sahaayta or paramparaagat brooding systamon dwaara kii ja sakati he
 Things to keep in mind during brooding: • 1
5 sq ft of space is required per bird for 0-4 weeks
 • bacchon ke nikalne se do din purv bruder grih ko taiyaar kar lenaa chahie
 • The material to be laid down should be spread in a circular form 2 meters in diameter
 • nanhen bacchon ko taap ke strot se dur jane dene se rokane ke liye 1 feet unchi baad avashya lagaai jaani chahie
 • The initial temperature is 95 ° f with a decrease of 5 ° f per week by the age of 04 weeks
 • pani ke liye kam gahare waterr kaa upyog kiya janaa chahie
 The average mortality during the first 04 weeks of life is 6–10%
 apane jivan ke shuruaati dinon main chote bachche khaanaa khaane or pani pine main anicchhuk hote hai
 The main reason for this is his poor eyesight and nervousness
 isliye unhen jabardastee khilaanaa padataa he
 Forced feeding a major cause of mortality in young children is starvation
 isliye khaanaa khilaane tathaa pani pilaane ke liye vishesh dhyaan rakhana padataa he
 For force feeding, milk should be given at the rate of 100 ml per one liter of water and one boiled egg per 10 children for fifteen days
 yah chote bacchon kii protein tathaa shakti kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karegaa
 Children can be attracted to food by gently tapping the food utensil with fingers
 feader tathaa waterr main rang-birange kanche yaa pattharon ko rakhane se bhi chote bachche unki taraf aakarshith honge
 Since turkeys love green color, some chopped green leaves should be added to it to increase their food intake
 pehle 02 dinon tak rang-birange andey philron ko bhi feader ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Commonly used material for bottoming is wood sawdust, rice rind and chopped wood peel etc
 used for brooding
 shuru main bacchon ke liye bichaai jane vaali saamagree kii motaai 2 inch honi chahie jise samay ke saath-saath 3-4 inch tak badhaayaa jaae
 To prevent caking in the laid material, it should be turned over at intervals
 III
 paalan pranaliturkiyon ko free range yaa gahan pranali ke antargat paala ja saktaa he
 A) Free range system of rearing benefit • This reduces the cost of food by up to 50 percent
 • kam nivesh• laagat-laabh anupaat adhik
 In the free range system, on one acre of fenced land, we can raise 200–250 adult turkeys
 prati pakshi 3-4 varg feet kii dar se raat main rahane ke liye aashray uplabdh karavaaya janaa chahie
 They should also be protected from predators during cleaning
 chaaya tathaa thanda vaataavaran uplabdh karwaane ke liye ped lagaana bhi jaruri he

 This reduces the cost of food by fifty percent
 iske atirikt leguminis chaara jaise lukraine, desmanths, stylo aadi bhi khilaayaa ja saktaa he
 Calcium should also be added at the rate of 250 grams per bird per week in the form of oyster shells to prevent weakness and limp in the legs of birds bred in free range
 bhojan kii laagat ko kam karne ke liye das pratishat bhojan ke sthaan par subjiyon kaa apshisht diya ja saktaa he
 In the health protection free range system, turkeys are at great risk from internal and external parasites
 isliye pakshiyon ke vikaas ko badhaane ke liye har maheene use keetanumukt tathaa deeping karnaa aavashyak he
 B
 Intensive system of rearing benefits: • Increased production capacity • Better management and disease control housing • Housing protects turkeys from sun, rain, wind, predators and also provides them comfort
 • desh ke garm bhaagon main ghar kii lambaai purv se pashchim disha kii ore honi chahie
 • The distance between two houses should be at least 20 meters and the children's house should be at least 50 to 100 meters from the adult's house
 • khule ghar kii chaudaai 9 meter se adhik nahin honi chahie
 • The height of the house can be from 2
6 to 3
3 meters from floor to ceiling
 • barish ke pani ke chhinton ko rokane ke liye ek meter kaa chazza bhi uplabdh karavaaya janaa chahie
 • The floor of the house should be cheap, durable and safe, especially of concrete with moisture proof
 jab turkiyon ko gahare kooday pranali ke antargat paala jaataa he to saamaanya prabandhan paristhitiyaan chiken jaisi hi hoti he kintu yah dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie ki unhen paryaapt sthaan, pani pine tathaa khaanaa khaane kaa sthaan uplabdh karavaaya ja sake, jisamen badi pakshi aasaani se rah sake

 Kalil or colloid is a chemical mixture in which one object is uniformly dispersed in another
 parikshepit vastu ke kan mishran me keval nilambit rahete he naa ki ek vilyan kii tarah 
 This is because the size of the particles in the membrane is larger than the size of the particles present in the solution - these particles are so small that they are completely dispersed in the mixture to form a homogenous mixture, but not so large that the light Scour and do not dissolve
 is parikshepan ke chalate kuch kalil vilyan jaise dikhte hai
 a bud system has two distinct phases: the first dispersion phase and the second continuous phase
 ek kalil pranali thos, drav yaa gasiy ho sakati he
 The table below gives a comparative analysis of the diameter of the particles of the plume in a homogenous and uniform mixture
 : Therefore, the collicular suspensions are intermediates for homogenous and homogeneous mixtures
 kalil ke liye angreji main kollid shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The word is derived from the Greek word kola which means 'glue'
 san 1861 i
 main ek angrej vaigyanik, tamas graham, ne dekha ki albumin, sares, gond, maand, silisik amla or isi prakaar ke anya padaarth jal main ghole jane par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se chhanakar nahin nikal pate
 In contrast, hydrolysis of sugars, urea, sodium, chloride, etc
 are released from the pores of the bio-membrane
 purv prakaar ke padaarth adhikansh main acristalia rup main milte hai is gun ke aadhaar par jal main viley padaartho kaa do virgon main vibhaajan kiya gaya: ek ve padaarth, jo crystalia the or jal main vilyan ke pashchaat jaev jhilli ke chhidron se bahirgat ho sakate the, crystalloid kehalaae or duusare ve, jo acristalia the or jal main gholne par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikalne main samarth nahin ho sakate the, kalil kehalaae
 But now it has been proved that crystalline substances like sugars and sodium chloride can also be obtained in the appropriate medium in the form of pigments
 kalilavastha main kalil kan ek avichhinn madhyam main bikhare rahete hai
 Thus, there are two components in the buds
 neeche kii suchi main pehla naam madhyam kaa or doosraa naam vitarit padaarth kaa he : The size of the calculus is particularly important
 aakaar main kalilkan anuon se bade hote hai, kintu aise sabhi kanon se, jo sookshmdarshi se dekhe ja sakate hai, ye aakaar main chote rahete hai
 They extend 10–5 cm
 From 10–7 cm Happens till
 yadhyapi upar di gai suchi ke prayek mail ke kalil praapt kiye ja sakate hai, phir bhi or prakaar ke kalil adhik prayukt hote hai or inhen kaa adhyayan bhi adhik vistaarpurvak kiya gaya he
 The solids of the solid or liquid distributed in the medium of water are called Sauls
 carbonic or acarbonic donon prakaar ke padaarth anek roopon main kalilavastha main paae jate hai
 Scientifically or technically, there is hardly any branch in which the buds are not used significantly
 apni isimhatta ke kaaran kalil vigyaan vishesh rup se hota gaya he
 In order to distinguish between the qualities of the Kalils, they have been divided into two major classes
 pehle varg main dhatviya prakaar ke kalil, jaise swarna kalil aadi, hai or duusare varg main protein prakaar ke kalil hai, jaise gelatin aadi
 Their special qualities are as follows: in donon prakaar ke kalilon ke liye jin shabdon kaa vishesh prayog hota he ve hai jalasantrasi or jalpremi 
 They are also called lyophobic and lyophilic in English in order
 yah vargeekaran purnroopen santoshjanak nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki katipay kalilon ke kuch gun donon charam virgon ke apokshakrit gunon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 These types of waterways have some metal oxides or hydroxides, some insoluble phosphate, molybdate, tungstate etc
 kuch log kalilon ko alambaabh or pysabh ke do virgon main vibhajit karte hai
 Apart from these, there is also a third category of Kalils which has become particularly important now
 yah varg kalileey vidyudvishleshya kehalaata he
 Soap water is a typical example of this
 in jalakalilon main vidyucchalakata bhi hoti he
 They are now being used more as refinements
 kalilon main atisookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se browneey gati ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Mergers do not have this action
 jab ek twri kiranpath kendrit karke jalakalil ke madhya se bheji jaati he tab kiranpath dugdhabh ho jaataa he or bahirgat kirane dhravatv praapt kar leti hai
 The reasons for this are the similarity in the size and wavelength of light and the uniformity in the wavelength of the distributed matter and the wavelength of the light and the alternation of the opposing material exceeds the mean of the different medium
 shaktishaalee sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se tindal ke prabhaav dwaara kalilkanon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 When viewed in this way, the calculus appears like the illuminated stars
 saath hi inaki gati twri, aniyamit or nirantar hoti he
 This motion is called Brownian motion
 isi gati se padaartho ke gatyaatmakataa-siddhant ke vichaaron kii praayogic pushti hui he
 By extracting the Avogadro constant according to this theory, it has been proved that the values of the Avogadro-constant derived from this method by considering the experimental error are comparable to the values of the constant extracted from other methods
 parin ne mastic gond ke kalil par pariksha karke aavogadro niyatank kaa maan 6
510E23 nikaala he
 The radius of the appropriate mastic glue particles in the experiment was 6
5 x 10–4
 anek pravidhik vidhiyon ke liye kalil nirmit karnaa aavashyak he
 Hydrographic plains can only be made easily, because watertight plots are reversible
 jalasantrasi kalilon ke nirmaan ke liye kai vidhiyaan prayukt hoti hai
 These methods can be divided into two classes - integration and disintegration
 pehali vidhi main aanaviya aakaar ke kanon ko dhire-dhire tab tak badhaayaa jaataa he jab tak ve kalilon kaa aakaar nahin praapt kar lete or unke adhik badhane kii gati kisi sthayitv pradaan karanevaale padaarth kii upasthiti se, athwa kisi jalpremi kalil ke mila dene se, niyantrit kar di jaati he
 By this method many metals, hydroxides, insoluble salts and silver halides used in photography have been made in the bud
 duusari vidhi se bade-bade kanon ko chote-chote kanon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In the braiding method metal pieces are obtained by breaking large pieces of metals with the help of electric arc
 is kaaran is vidhi ko vighatan kii vidhi kaha jaataa he, kintu vastav main ye kalil bhi ekikaran kii vidhi se hi banate hai
 The metal evaporates at high temperature of the arc
 phir vaashp ke ati sookshm kan ekikrut hokar kalilkanon kaa aakaar praapt kar lete hai
 In fact kalil-mill is the major means of making Kalil by partition
 is yantra main do platen, jo ek duusare ke atyant sameep rahati hai, paraspar vipareet disha main gumti he
 The material to be delivered is sent between these two plates with the appropriate medium
 is prakaar kan chote hokar kalil kanon kaa aakaar grahan kar lete hai
 For the treatment of the buds produced by any of the two methods, they are subjected to a different action by dialysis with a geminal substance
 aisa karne ke liye kalil ko parchament yaa celophen ke jhole main rakhaa jaataa he
 This bag is now kept in pure solvent
 yah vilaayak hi kalil kaa madhyam hota he
 Electrical dialysis can make refinement more complete and faster
 jalpremi kalil atyant sthaayee hote hai or vidyudvishleshya kii laghumatraaon ke prati niskriy hote hai
 Their stability is due to their solubility in the medium
 in kalilkanon kaa bahya tal madhyam ke anuon se dhakaa rahata he
 In this way the free energy of the outer plane is negligible
 isse ye kan aakaar main badhane main asamarth rahete hai
 In addition, it has been observed that water-soluble materials reduce the interstellar stress of the medium
 is prabhaav se bhi kalilon kaa sthayitv niyantrit rahata he
 The stability of the drainage systems is due to the charge located on the tubes
 kalilkanon ke bahya tal par aavesh kaa srijan unke dwaara avashoshit yanon ke kaaran hota he
 The charge at the bottom of the calculus decreases with the addition of an electrolyte, and gradually a situation arises when the bottom of the calculus at the lowest concentration of the electrolyte is unable to resist the forces of integration
 is prakaar vidyudvishleshya kaa vah nimnatam sandran, jo kisi kalil kii ek nishchit maatra ke avakshepan main samarth hota he, kalil kaa avakshepan maan kaha jaataa he
 In general, the higher the valence of the ion of the electrolyte, which is opposite to the charge of the alkaline, the stronger the precipitation power of the electrolyte
 jalasantrasi kalilon ko vidyudvishleshyon se surakshit rakhane ke liye unamem jalpremi kalil mila die jate hai
 This method is called conservation method
 swarnakalil ko gelatin kii sookshm maatra se avakshipt kiya ja saktaa he kintu is protein kii adhik maatra is kalil ko sthayitv pradaan karti he
 According to Jigmondi, the gold content of a black preservative is the number of milligrams of the preservative in the presence of 10 cubic centimeters of gold in the presence of 1 cubic cm of sodium chloride
 Can be precipitated by a solution whose concentration is 10 percent
 kalil kaa sangrakshan vishesh mahatv rakhata he or atyant pracheen samay se iskaa vyavhaar hota rahaa he
 It has already been said that there is charge on the black particles
 kalil par aavesh kaa prakaar gyaat karne ke liye saral avasorana prayog kiye ja sakate hai
 Positive compounds are absorbed by silica jelly and negative compounds by aluminum hydroxide
 jalasantrasi kalil ke sthayitv ke liye aavesh kaa sthaan pramukh he
 The type of charge depends on the physical nature of the substance and on the electrodynamic that provides stability to the particle
 udaahranarth yadi rajat iodide ke saul ko len to usapar aavesh kaa prakaar dhanatmak yaa rinatmak donon hi ho saktaa he
 If there is a subtle excess of silver nitrate in Kalil, then Saul will be positive
 iske vipareet yadi potacium iodide kaa aadhiky hua to saul rinatmak ho jayega
 It has been observed that the charge of the silver iodide membrane becomes positive due to the presumptive adsorption of the positive silver ion, and the charge of this ion becomes negative due to the negative ion adsorption of the positive iodide
 kalileey tal par aavesh kii maatra or vibhav dhan-vidyut-sanchaaran dwaara parimapit kiye jate hai
 Saul is filled in a tube containing two platinum electrodes
 ab saul main disht vidyuddhara pravaahit kii jaati he
 If the particles move towards the positive, there is a negative electric charge on them
 vidyut kshetra main kanon kii is prakaar kii gati dhan-vidyut-sanchaaran kehalaati he
 This speed can be conveniently measured by suitable optical methods
 veg ke maapan dwaara vidyudvibhav kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 This voltage is commonly called electrical-dynamic-voltage
 yah vidyutagtyatmk vibhav us samay bhi dekha jaataa he jab vidyudvishleshiya vilyan ko kisi sanrdhra tanupat se hokar bheja jaataa he
 Research has also been conducted on two other related verbs
 ye hai dharavibhav or avakshepan vibhav
 The electrical dynamic potential is different from the Nernst electrochemical potential
 ab siddh ho gaya he ki vaidyuthik rasinic vibhav vah vibhav he jo vitarit kala or vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The electrodynamic potential is the voltage that lies between the main volume of the distribution medium in the stationary part of the bicameral plane attached to that distributed art
 vitarit kala se sanlagn dwiktal kaa vaastavik swabhaav ab bhi kalpana kaa vishay he
 Nevertheless, it has been known that the electrodynamic-potential is particularly affected by the ions present
 gas ke niyam kalil vilyanon par thik baithte hai, iske paryaapt pramaan hai
 The curvature pressure of a Kalil can be calculated by the following equation: jahaan: Now, as the viscosity pressure is inversely proportional to the size of the particle, it makes it clear that the infusion pressure of the spiral should decrease and their volume should also increase with the distribution volume
 is prakaar saadhaarant: saulon kii rasakarshan daab kam hi hoti he or jab rasakarshan daab adhik ho jaati he to vah mukhyat: ashuddhiyon ke kaaran hi hoti he
 Measuring pressure is measured with the help of a semipermeable membrane
 vidyudvishleshan ke asmaan vitaran se kuch kalilon main dononsantulan naamak kriya ke kaaran jatilta utpann hoti he
 The study of this balancing act has been studied on dyes, soaps, and many other collicular electrodynamics called Congo Red
 in sthitiyon main kalileey padaarth vidyudvishleshya ke samaan vyavhaar karata he
 When the shape of an ion is similar to the shape of the calculus, when the potential is created on both sides of the dilute, which is called the dilute potential
 kai protein saulon main tanupat-vibhav sadaiv hi utpann ho jaataa he or jivit selon par aavesh is tanupat santulan ke kaaran hi hota he
 The shape or form of the calculus cannot be seen by looking through a microscope
 phir bhi kalilkanon kii sankhya gini ja sakati he; tab vitarit padaarth ke purna aaytan ke maan se ek kan kaa ausat aaytan gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 But when a Saul is made, then many particles of particles are present in it
 kalilkanon kaa rup golakaar, dandakaar, dirghavrittakar yaa paratdaar ho saktaa he
 Several methods have been developed to find the form of Kalilakanas which are based on optical properties
 in kalilon kii visheshta he vitaran madhyam kii shyanta par prabhaav daalana
 Viscosity increases mostly and increases with the increase in volume of the delivered material
 ek vishesh sandran ke pahunchne par shyanta itani bad jaati he ki kalil jelly kaa rup grahan kar letaa he
 Jelly can also be obtained from precipitation of Saul
 jelly kaa upyog simit sa he or gelatin, aighar aighar, starch aadi ke saulon ko sheethal karke jo ardhapardarshak jeliyaan banaai jaati hai unhen hi jelly kii sangya di jaati he
 Most waterfowl cultivars make jelly upon cooling or heating
 kai acarbonic jalasantrasi kalil bhi vishesh paristhitiyon main jelly ke rup main praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 In this way, many aqueous hydroxides, insoluble phosphates, molybdates gels are made in the laboratory
 jelly saadhaarant: taralamochan kaa gun pradarshit karti he
 The jelly shrinks and cracks when kept for a long time, and the water tied in the jelly comes out
 jeliyon ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: pratyasth tathaa drudh
 Elastic gels are usually made from natural clays such as gelatin, agar, but most inorganic gels, which also contain silicic acid, show strong behavior
 kuch jeliyon kaa swabhaav vicitra hota he
 They are converted back into shawl when shaken, agitated, or by the effect of transcendental waves
 kintu yadi ab unhen sthir rakh diya jaae to ve phir jelly ban jaati hai
 This action can be repeated many times
 is kriya ko sparshabodh kehete hai
 Special discoveries have been made on the solutes of proteins in water-loving plants
 iskaa kaaran he inkaa shareerik rasayan shaastra main mahatv
 Proteins found in natural state are generally negatively charged
 adhikansh saul amleey banaae jane par dhanatmak aavesh praapt kar lete hai
 Thus at a particular ph there will be no charge on the solute of the protein
 ise samavidyut vindu kehete hai
 This leads to identification of proteins
 rasinic gunon main pracheen ubhaydharmee hota he kyonki isamen or bonon samooh rahete hai
 Due to this property, the protein acts as a buffer
 jantuon ke jivan main is gun kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Proteins have the ability to provide stability to the hydrological plants and their golden number helps in the diagnosis of many diseases
 kalilon ke samast upyogon kii gananaa sambhav nahin
 Most biological fluids, such as blood, etc
, are by nature
 calcium-sabun ke rup main calcium, swarna, louh, vang, manganeez, rajat ityadi dhaatuen, yaa unke aviley yogic, kalil ke rup main oshadhiyon main prayukt hote hai
 The dietary science has to consider the Kallikas
 humas or chikani mitti ke kalileey gun bhoomi kii urvartaa or uske bhautik gunon par vishesh prabhaav daalate hai
 Fibers are organic and the textile industry is also the industrial industry
 chheent ke nirmaan main prayukt honevaale rang or chapai kalileey gunon ke kaaran hi sampann hoti he
 In some reactants, the manufacture of synthetic silk is based on the scaly properties of the cellulosic material
 sabun or apkshaalak kalileey padaarth hai or anek vastu-samooh, yatha chikaanewaale padaarth, plastic, rabar, snehak padaarth, tel rang ityadi main kalileey gun paae jate hai
 The glass, clay and cement industries are particularly associated with the sciences
 hamaare adhikansh aahaar, jaise proteinein, starch ke rup main carbohydrate vasa aadi bhi gun main kalileey hai
 The technology of Kalil Rasayana is essential in making many of our food items such as bread, butter, jelly, jam, drinks, ice cream, etc

 In this novel, this song is sung by a monk named Bhawanand
 isaki dhun yadunath bhattacharya ne banaayi thi
 In 2003, in an international survey conducted by BBC World Service, in which around 7,000 songs were selected from around the world to select the ten most famous songs of the time, and according to BBC, people from 155 countries / islands had it
 Vande Mataram was second in the top 10 songs in the poll
 yadi bangla bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaay to iskaa sheershak "bande maataram" hona chaiye "vande maataram" nahin
 Since the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bengali script and since there is no other letter in Bengali script, it was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay under the title Bande Mataram
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sheershak 'bande maataram' hona chaiye tha
 But there is no meaning of 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and "vande Mataram" pronunciation means "I pray to Mother", so writing and reading Vande Mataram in Devanagari script would be expedient

 Apart from many Indian languages, English-translations of Anandamath, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada etc
 were also published
 dow nareshchandra sengupt ne san 1906 main Abbey of Bliss ke naam se iskaa angreji-anuwaad prakashit kiya
 Arvind Ghosh translated the song 'vande Mataram' described in 'anandamath' into English prose and poetry

 Initially, only two of its verses were composed, which were in Sanskrit
 in donon padon main keval mathrubhumi kii vandana thi
 When he wrote a Bengali novel called Anand Math in 1882, then he also included this song in the love of the motherland
 yah upanyaas angreji shashan, jameendaaron ke shoshan va prakritik prakope main mar rahi janata ko jaagrit karnehetu achaanak uth khadey hue sanyasi vidroh par aadhaarit tha
 This factual history was mentioned by Bankim Babu himself in the third edition of 'anand Math'
 or maje kii baat yah he ki saare tathy bhi unhone angreji vidwaanon-gleg va hanter kii pustakon se diye the
 In the novel, this song is sung by a monk rebel named Bhawanand
 geet kaa mukhdaa vishuddh sanskrit main is prakaar he: "vande maataram ! sujalaan sufalaan malayaj sheetlam, shasy shyamalam maataram
 "the verse after Mukhade is also in Sanskrit:" Shubhra Jyotsnaam Pulkit Yaminim, Ful Kusumit Drumdal Shobhinim; Suhasiniin Sumadhur Bhasheenam, Sukhaand Varadaan Mataram
 " kintu upanyaas main is geet ke aage jo pad likhe gayi the ve upanyaas kii mul bhashaa arthath bangla main hi the
 In all these latter terms, the motherland is praised as Durga
 yah geet ravivaar, karthik sudi navami, shake 1797 ko puraa hua
 It is said that he wrote this song on the train while coming to Naihati from Sealdah
 bengal main chale swadhinata-aandolan ke dauraan vibhinn reliyon main josh bharne ke liye yah geet gaaya jane laga
 Gradually this song became highly popular among the people
 british sarkaar isaki lokapriyata se bhayakrant ho uthi or usne is par pratibandh lagane par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur sang this song at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1896
 paanch saal baad yani san 1901 main kalakatta main hue ek anya adhiveshan main shri charandas ne yah geet punah gaaya
 The song was given by Sarladevi Chaudharani at the Banaras session of 1905
 congress-adhiveshnon ke alaava aazaadee ke aandolan ke dauraan is geet ke prayog ke kaaphi udhaaharan maujuud hai
 Lala Lajpat Rai started the publication of the journal from Lahore named Vande Mataram
 angrejon kii goli kaa shikaar banakar dam todanevaali aazaadee kii divaani maatangini haajra kii jubaan par aakhri shabd "vande maataram" hi the
 In 1907, when Madame Bhikhaji Cama hoisted the tricolor in Stuttgart, Germany, "vande Mataram" was written in the middle of it
 arya printing press, lahore tathaa bhartiya press, dehradun se san 1929 main prakashit kakori ke shahid pan0 ram prasad 'bismil' kii pratibandhit pustak "kranti gitanjali" main pehla geet "matra-vandana" vande maataram hi tha jisamen unhone keval is geet ke do hi pad diye the or uske baad is geet kii prashasti main vande maataram sheershak se ek swarchit urdu ghazal di thi jo us kalkhand ke asankhya anaam hutatmaon kii aawaaj ko abhivyakti detii he
 Restricted in the British period, this book is now edited and available in libraries
 swadhinata sangram main is geet kii nirnaayak bhagidaari ke baavjood jab raashtragan ke chayan kii baat aayi to vande maataram ke sthaan par rabindranath thakur dwaara likhe va gaaye gayi geet jan gana man ko variyata di gayi
 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song "vande Mataram", because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In view of these objections, in 1937, the Congress took a deep view on this dispute
 jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti jisamen moulana abul kalam aaazaad bhi shaamil the, ne paaya ki is geet ke shuruuaati do pad to mathrubhumi kii prashansa main kahe gayi hai, lekin baad ke padon main hindu devi-devataaon kaa zikr hone lagata he; isaliye yah nirnay liya gaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do padon ko hi raashtra-geet ke rup main prayukt kiya jaayegaa
 In this way, Jana Hee Jan-gana-man Adhinayak of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Thakur was allowed to remain as the national anthem and Mohammad Iqbal's Qaumi Tarane Saare Jahan Se Achcha with the initial two-song song Vande Mataram national song composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was approved
 swatantrata prapti ke baad dow rajendra prasad ne samvidhan sabha main 24 janvari 1950 main 'vande maataram' ko raashtragit ke rup main apnaane sambandhi vaktavy padhaa jise sweekaar kar liya gaya
 The statement made by Dr
 Rajendra Prasad to the Constituent Assembly is as follows: anand math upanyaas ko lekar bhi kuch vivaad hai, kuch kattar log ise muslim virdohi maanate hai
 He says that in this, Muslims have been described as foreign and traitorous
 vande maataram gane par bhi vivaad kiya ja rahaa he
 The first two stops of this song, which are relevant, do not contain any anti-muslim talk and do not worship any goddess or Durga
 par in logon kaa kahana he ki- However, it is not the case that all Muslims of India object to this or that all Hindus insist on singing it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kuch saal pehle vikhyath sangeetkaar e0 aar0 rahamaan ne, jo khud ek musalmaan hai, vande maataram ko lekar ek sangeet elbum taiyaar kiya tha jo bahut lokapriy hua
 Most people believe that this dispute is political
 kya kisi ko koi geet gane ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he athwa nahin? yah prashn sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh bijoy emmanuele varses kerala rajya naam ke ek vaad main uthaaya gaya
 In this suit, some students were expelled from school because they refused to sing the national anthem Jana Gana Mana
 yah vidhyaarthee skool main raashtragan ke samay iske sammaan main khadey hote the tathaa iskaa sammaan karte the par geet ko gaate nahin the
 He refused to sing
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne unki yachika sweekaar kar lee or skool ko unhen waapas lene ko kaha
 The Supreme Court said that if a person honors the national anthem but does not sing it, it does not mean that he is insulting it
 at: ise na gane ke liye us vyakti ko dandit yaa pratadit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since Vande Mataram is the national anthem of this country, the same law and rules will apply even if it is forced to sing forcefully

 sainik kii jatigat vibhaavna Soldier - The word is one but it has two castes
 Yes, two species
 One is called an officer and the other is called a rank
 As soon as you hear the words of soldiers, you would think that these people wake up in the night and guard the borders, take the enemy's bullets on the cine, protect the motherland in every situation
 It is exactly the same
 But do you know that when it is talked about their rights, then only one caste gets the loot
 And these are the castes who sit and fight in air condition, they consider the jawans as slaves, they have got their own Sandas "officer Sandas" and separate kitchen "officer Mess" made, their children slapped if they speak one word in Hindi
 They kill, no matter how ineffective their children are, they are decided to be their officers, no matter how fast a farmer's boy is, if the British are weak then they say that there is no OLQ, after retirement, after the election Golf do enjoy it, Soldiers are often the voice of television, but they always work for the benefit of their caste, and these people are called officers
 And it is these people who have drafted the OROP or the Financial Commission
 Do you still think that these castes will do justice to the other hapless caste "adhar Rank"? Don't you think that another caste should also have adequate representation in every forum? bharat rakshak brijesh kumaar

 xxrep 90 - Jai jawan jai kisan hamaare desh kii ye vidmbana he kii jahaan kisaan ko dharti kaa taat kaha gaya usee dharti maan kii raksha ke kaabil use nahin samaja jaataa
 Soldiers of India's armies come from poor peasant families
 jinke upar hindustan kii dharti maan kaa qarz he unhen sevadaar, ghulaam banaakar unki beizzati kari jaati he
 In today's India, even after 68 years of independence, the children of the village farmers of the country have different feelings! Different food! To abstain! Washing clothes of Memsahab! Polish the shoes of sir All these slavery works are forced
 sena main 97 pratishat ye gaanvathi jawan he inhen afasar banane v promoshan ke kaabil nahin gina jaataa
 Because these soldiers do not know English language and manner
 ram lallaa ke samay main chaahe akbar badshaah ke vaqt main mere bharat desh main deshi hona shame kii baat nahin thi
 Today because my soldier is native
 kisi garib kisaan kaa betaa he use fouj se 15-17 saal kii desh seva ke baad jab uskaa deshprem uski kaabiliyat or himmat ke charche pure vishwa main he tab laat laat maar ke seva nivrutt kiya jaataa he
 During every pay commission, black Englishmen sing the song of lack of officers
 koi ye jawaab degaa kii apni praarambhik seva kaa contract samay purna hone par 99% sainik jo kii 15-17-20 saal ke anubhav siddh yoddha he
 Why are they allowed out of the army? What is this policy of human resource management? Where the son of a farmer with indigenous accent is made a soldier but is not fit to become an officer? What is the quality that some look for in a creeping black English service selection board? And what they do not get in 99 percent of the soldiers
 har saal 15 lakh javaanon main se keval 10-12 jawan hi afasar promot kiye jate he
 He has also found the countrymen who have brought medals in the Olympics, Asian Games, and International and National Games to the country and proudly raise the head of the country

 At the same time, Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, feels very proud by making them all colonels and group captains
 agar kapildev, sachin tedulkar or mahendra singh dhoni ko anerri hawaldaar major kaa pad se sushobhit karte to kya yah khilaadi sena ke is sammaan ko taiyaar hote
 
 
 
 shaayad nahi! magar is desh ko isi sena ne kai anterrashtriya str ke khilaadi diye jinhone olympic khelon me bharat ko jeet dilaai magar badale me sena ne sammaan diya hawaldaar major kaa
 Hockey wizard Havildar Major Dhyanchand is one of them, did not even consider him worthy of Nayab Subedar
 jab sena se is bare me patrakaron ne poocha to sena ne apane spashtikaran me kaha ki kisi bhi sainik khilaadi kaa pramotion utkrisht pradarshan ke aadhaar par hawaldaar yaa naayab soobedaar ke pad tak ho saktaa he
 The official post of officer is not applicable to the jawan, there is no such policy
 sena me sipaahi hone kii bajah se na is khilaadi ko sena me afasar pad mila or na hi bharat ratna ke laayak samajha gaya
 May it be good for military colleagues who started calling Dhyanchand as Havildar Major instead of Major Dhyanchand and later on journalists started addressing him as Major Dhyanchand
 jab do sainik ek pad par, ek samay tak sarvice kar ke ritair hote hai par unke ritairement main kuch saalon kaa antar hota he or is bich nayaa vetan ayog bhi aa jaataa he, to baad main ritair hone vaale kii pension nae vetan ayog ke anusaar bad jaati he
 But the pension of an earlier retired military could not be increased in the same proportion
 “swatantra bharat main koi bhi bhukh se nahin maregaa

 iske sainya kharch baari nahin honge
 Its army will not subdue its own people or anyone else's land
 iske sabase achche vetan paane vaale adhikari iske sabase kam vetan paane vaale sainiko se bahut zyada nahin kamaayenge
 And it will not be expensive or difficult to get justice here ”
 sardaar vallabhbhai patel The pension of soldiers cannot be compared to general government employees because on the one hand, while military officers and general government employees get the salary for 60 years, the soldiers of the military class have to retire in the year itself and their Service conditions are also more difficult
 angrejon ke samay main sainik varg ke phogiyon kii pension tankhwaah kii kareeb 80 pratishat hoti thi jabaki sainya adhikari varg evam saamaanya sarkari karmchaaree kii 33 pratishat hua karti thi
 bharat sarkaar ne ise sahi nahin mana or 1957 ke baad se phogiyon kii pension ko kam kii or anya kshetron kii pension badhaani shuru kii
 Every soldier enlisted in the army, despite being a citizen of independent India, voluntarily relinquished his human rights and constitutional fundamental rights
 or svaichhik daasatv kaa sweekaar kiya
 Every order of the officer considered the line of stone
 is duniya main janma prayek jiv swatantry kii kaamana rakhata he
 We military gave our self-respect, our freedom to the country
 sena main sevarat rahete samay ham deshi bharatiya faujee bhai apane saath hue har anyaay ko sehate rahe he
 "time heals huge wounds" Sanyo's grief seems quite common for this reason
 kyunki hamen aadat si ho gayi he
 Today it is our position that many of us have accepted this permanent enslavement by brother A, with weak mindset
 or is taraf purv afasar ye sweekaar karne ko taiyaar nahin kii purv sainik ab unke das gulam nahin or purv sainiko ko or unke parivarajano ko bhi utana hi seva or sammaan paane kaa adhikaar he
 As much as he and his family have
 pehali ladai apane swabhimaan kii honi chahie, bhedbhaav khatm karne kii honi chahie
 There is a demand of the soldiers that from 1 April 2014 this scheme should be implemented with the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission
 The soldiers say that if we want to bring real balance, then we should also retire on 60 years
 We are retired only after 33 years and after that we spend our whole life with pension
 While other employees get full salary for 60 years
 In such a situation, the percentage of our pension should not be reduced
 baharhaal is vakt ye faujee sirf itnaa hi chaahate hai ki chathe vetan ayog ko lagu karte hue samaan pad or samaan samay tak sarvice kar chuke phogiyon ko ek samaan pension di jaay, chaahe donon kisi bhi saal main ritair hue hon
 agar ye yojana lagu hoti he to kareeb 25 lakh phogiyon yaa unke pariwaron ko laabh hoga
 iske liye har saal sarkaar ko kareeb 9 hazaar karon rupee kaa atirikt bhaar sahanaa hoga

Isn't it rewarded for a medal whenever a gallant of the army shows unmatched bravery and skill for the country? Are medals given only to ketchup colonels? Friends reconcile between the Madal Return Gang and the lack of transparency in the allocation of medals in the Indian Armed Forces

 In the words of the entire soldier Swaraj Gandhi mere pyaare afasar bhai, 'you are reaping what you have sown till date
 ’ What is Purna Swaraj? Does Swaraj mean freedom only in English terms? Bapu has said, in his book Hind Swaraj
 sainiko ke purna swaraj ke uplakshya main gandhiji kaa swaraj

 From the English mentality of freedom slavery

 All the soldiers should not be given fake certificates by discriminating in education and certificates given during the service
 afasaron kii ye sab shaitani manshaa sainiko ko unke sabase bade adhikaar padhai se dur rakhane kii he
 Sainik Swaraj means that only the exercises of all the army from recognized educational institutions in India should be counted
 16
 swaraj he har hindustani kaa empowerment
 Swaraj is skill India
 swaraj he 60 pratishat sainikon kaa sammaan purvak pramotion se afasar bananaa
 17
 Sainik Swaraj is that both soldiers and officers get equal respect if injured or hurt in war or other times
 galentry award, medal aabantan ho chaahe disability pension yaa shahid kii vidhwaa ko pension aabantan in jagahon par ho rahe bhedbhaav akshamya he
 Swaraj should be brought here immediately
 18
 baapu ne kaha tha jab tak ham hindustanio ke andar se ham angreziyat ko nikaal nahin dete tab tak angarez agar chale bhi jaye kya phayda?? 19
 This discrimination is false, untrue, theft, corruption will be away from the heart of every Indian, only then will the true Sainik Swaraj come
 20
 gandhiji ne kaha tha agar angrez bhartiya samskruthik mulya jaise kii sammaan samanvay apana lete he to unhen ham bhartiya sweekaar karenge
 21
 The thing found with fear will only last as long as there is fear
 ham ko man kii shakti dena man vijay karen
 Hail yourself before the victory of others
 ham ko man kii shakti dena
 Discrimination should discriminate from your heart
 doston se bhul ho to maaf kar saken
 Avoid falsehoods, let the truth prevail
 dusron kii jai se pehle khud ko jai karen
 Give us the power of mind and win the mind
 dusron kii jai se pehle khud ko jai karen
 Give us the power of mind
 mushkilen paden to ham pe itnaa karm kar, saath de to dharm kaa, chalem to dharm par, khud pe hausala rahe, badi se naa daren

 aapkaa acemev gorwal Pay commission and discrepancies sena me tisare vetan ayog ke kaal yani san 1974 se lekar 2016 ke saatven vetan ayog tak sainik javaanon or jesios ke vetanman saath hameshaa bhedbhaav kiya kyoki ham hameshaa khamoshrahe ek anushaasit sainik kii tarah or sheersh haa hamaare sheersh adhikarigan hamaari samasyaon or vetan visangatiyon ke prati sadaiv udasin bane rahe


aakhir kyon? kyonki unki ritairement ke baad kii mahatvakanksha tab hi paravaan chadh sakati thi jab vah khud bhi khamosh rahen or apane maatahat javaanon ko bhi anushaasan ke naam par daraa kar unki aawaaj ko dabaa kar rakhe 
 javaanon kaa masalaa tha or jawan munh khol nahi saktaa isaliye jo bhi sarkaar dwaara sena ke javaanon ko diya gaya in sheersh str ke adhikariyon ne unki haisiyat se zyada hi mana or sweekaar kar liya yani ek sainik kii haisiyat ko civillian karmchaaree se kamatar hi samajha or yahi bajah he ki ek sainik kaa vetan dilli or chandigarh kii police ke constebul ke vetan se bhi kaaphi kam he
 kya sena ke sainik kaa str constebul ke str se kam hona chaiye xxrep 4 
 aakhir vetan ayog ne kis str par sena ko police ke str se kamatar aanka xxrep 4 
 agar yahi haalat rahi to sena kaa aglaa str homeguards ke baraabar ho jaayegaa 
 sach to yah he ki pichhali lagbhag paanch vetan ayog kii siforeeshon me sena ke str or unke vetan visangatiyon kii taraf se puri tarah kinaaraa kar liya jisaki bajah se sena kaa in vetan aayogon se moh bhang ho gaya
 aaj sainik kam umr me ritair hokar mufalison kii jindagi jeene ko majaboor he or apni jaij maangon ko lekar jantar mantar par vaithne ko majaboor he

 As far as i have a little knowledge about the difference between the salary and allowances of the Army from the Third Pay Commission to the Seventh Pay Commission and the salary of Civilian employees, i want to throw some light on that and why the Army was downgraded from Civilian
 First of all, i cite the reason that the army and other police force organizations are a disciplined organization and are always determined to follow the above instructions literally and for this they have given up their lives to sacrifice their lives
 Such countrymen believe xxrep 5 
 because we cannot open our mouths under any circumstances
 The government and sly bureaucrats and ministers of the government took advantage of this by continuously reducing the salary and pension of the soldiers of our three armies and JCO rank soldiers at the time of the Third Pay Commission, when the basic pay scale of a soldier was only 175
 Rs
 235 per month and annual increase of Rs
 5 / - per month of our army by the top officers of our army
 Ignored such a big discrepancy
 Even due to low service and early retirement of soldiers, pension was fixed at 75% of the last pay scale, that too was reduced to 50% of the last salary of civilian employees at the same rate, that too after serving 33 years
 xxrep 4 
 The army was still silent, but the Pay Commission did not understand the effort to know how a young man whose total service is 15 years would get 50% of the last pension
 The result which the young man was getting 75% reached 35% and Civilian employees used to take 35% and it reached 50%
 If the top officers of our army had expressed their opposition to this injustice at that time, this situation would not have happened today
 Now the Sixth Pay Commission has exempted 50% of the last basic salary of government employees from the rule of service of 33 years and all civilian government employees have benefited in pension and have also received arrears but no separate notification in the army Withdrawal of which 50% pension formula is still applicable to the army for 33 years of service, i
e
 those who are retired after serving 15 to 20 years Only 30 to 35% of the basic salary is being paid xxrep 4 
 chauthe vetan ayog jo 1986 me lagu hua usame sena ke jawan or civillian karmchaariyon ko lagbhag ek samaan karne kii koshish kii gayi jaise jawan kaa vetanman bhi 935 / - se shuru hua or loar dibijan clerk kaa bethan bhi 950 / - rupaye se tha magar phir ek or game khel diya gaya ki jawan kaa vaarshik vruddhi 15 / - thi jabaki loar dibijan clerk kii 25 / - rupaye rakh di yani sena or civillian karmchaariyon ko ek samaan vetanman kii sharuaat to kar di gayi lekin sena ke munh na kholane kii aadat kii bajah se phir unke bhatte or vaarshik briddhi me kaaphi antar kar diya gaya jisaki bajah se vah ritairement ke samay civillian karmchaariyon ke mukaable pension me kaaphi neeche chale gayi yaa phir punarribijan me bhi kaaphi pichad gayi
 kyonki us samay yah bhedbhaav sirf sena ke jesio or javaanon ke vetan tak simit tha to adhikariyon ne bhi zyada is par dhyaan nahi diya
 aaj kii taarikh me jab yahi game sarkaar or byorocrates ne milakar adhikariyon ke saath khelaa or sena ke adhikariyon kaa str police or paramilatary ke adhikariyon se neeche kar diya to ab sena ke sheersh adhikariyon ke pet me bhayankar dard shuru ho gaya
 or dhaksha mantri se lekar pradhanmantri tak guhaar lagaate gum rahe he
 But the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission again broke the back of the army personnel and the jcos completely 


 which i have a record and whose resistance even the army soldiers could not do due to fear and discipline but The educated and highly trained aircraft of the Air Force were done by the personnel with technical knowledge and in return, the Air Force did a court martial by punishing all such air soldiers with a job
 Outside the fort and likewise, after thinking his future in the army was bleak, many airmen of other sergeant level took the WAG premature retirement of the event, 90% of them were lucky to be in the most nationalized banks from the clerk-cum-cashier to the branch manager
 Kar continued to work for the entire 60 years
 Well later when the army and navy also started opposing it, then again the government raised a special pay revision committee for soldiers from army personnel to JCO level again
 The revised Betman was implemented again from 10 Oct 1996 whereas earlier it was implemented by the Pay Commission from 01 Jan 1996
 But in this jco's Nave Subedar was considered to be of the same rank as Sub Inspector of Police and kept Subedar as Inspector level and Subedar Major was given the same as Subedar by giving only one additional bethan increment but when it came to equal pay scale of police then The government has agreed that the pay scale of the army should not be less than the police but should be equal to or more than that and the then Honorable Defense Minister Mulayam Singh has always asked the army to give high priority and due to his personal efforts, the army personnel were kept higher than the civil servants or the police, due to which the Fifth Pay Commission was again In the revised pay scale, jcos and jawans started getting higher pay scales from the same level of civilian employees and the lowest pay scale of a soldier was 3250 / - while that of lower division clerk was 3050 / - but still this bureaucrats are behind in playing their tricks
 The pay scale of NB Subedar y Group, however, started from Rs 5620 / - and Subedar y Group started from Rs 6600 / - while Sub Inspector of Police was 5500 / - and Inspector
 Rank was started from 6500 / - but kept the annual increase of Rs
 140 / - to the Naib Subedar of the army and kept Rs
 175 / - for the Sub Inspector
 Similarly, the annual increase of the Subedar was Rs
 170 / - while the Police Inspector got Rs
 200 / -
 Was done xxrep 4 
 xxrep 5 ! yah sab parinaamon kaa nateeja yah hua ki prayek das varsh baad hone vaale vetan ayog ke faisle me ham sainik hameshaa apane vetanman or milane vaali pension me neeche or bahut neeche pahunchate gayi or hamaare adhikariyon ko us samay yah samaj hi nahi aayaa ki aane vaale samay me yah hamaari sena ke liye kitna ghaatak siddh hoga or hua bhi vahi jahaan javaanon me apane vetan or bhatto ke prati niraashaa badti gayi or iskaa kaaran unhone sena ke apane sheersh adhikariyon kii javaanon or jesio ke prati udaseenta or khud kii ati mahatvakanksha yani ritairement ke baad puraskaar swaroop milane vaale sambedhanik pad paane kii laalasaa ko mana
 Now is the time to wake up and strengthen the voice of the entire military organization by rising above selfishness
 The three Chiefs have rejected the Pay Commission report in the current situation and requested the government to once again remove the incongruities
 
 We have to fight our own battles together because it is also a karma war and Sri Krishna of Mahabharata is a crusade where the Holocaust and the dishonest people are certain
 We are not sad that why the government has not removed our salary discrepancies, we are sad when the government adopts a rigid Rabia on the legitimate demands of the soldiers who are willing to sacrifice their lives, that is the government's indiscipline and strike of civilian employees
 She succumbs to the threat and accepts their legitimate and illegitimate demands
 After all, a soldier also has his own house and family, which also has the same needs as other civil servants
 rashan main bhi bhedbhaav !! After all, why could we not change the two-level food system made by the British in the Indian Army, even though the country has become 70 years old and we are still carrying forward the arrangement made by the British
 shaayad bharatiya sainya adhikariyon ko bhi yah nahi pataa ki kyon angrej adhikariyon kii rasoi or nivas sthaan bhartiya sainikon se alag hota tha
 i wanted to raise the same issue in this forum that after closing the windows from all over the house and covering the curtains, the inside people can be covered in the eyes of the outsiders but the condition of the people inside the interned slaves Gets worse
 jab tak vyavastha paardarshee nahi hogi tab tak is tarah kii samasyaye baar baar aayengi
 After all, why the CAG is not audited inside our army
 aakhir hamaari vyavastha teen stareey audit ke babajood bhi kaig kii chetabani kaa kaaran kyon bani
 What is our three-tier audit system and which is it
 unit audit, local audit or test audit yah tino puri tarah fail he kyonki bade bade ghotaale huye he or lagaataar ho rahe he
 Apart from the five countries of the world, there are no three different eateries in the army in any country, nor there is any discrimination in the quantity and quality of ration of soldiers or military officers, but here
 jahaan par bhedbhaav tha bhi vahaan par un deshon me yah vyavastha samaapt kar di gayi magar bharat me yah angrejon kii subidhanusaar banaayi vyavastha ko desh kii aazaadee ke sattar saal baad bhi badastoor jari he
 This leads to discrimination and dissatisfaction
 jaraa yah bhi gaur kare ki kyon afasaron ke bhojanalay sainiko ke bhojanalayon se alag hote the
 There were two important reasons for this which cannot be justified in today's time
 pehla kaaran yah tha ki angrej adhikari hote the or bhartiya nimnastar ke adhikari evam sainik hote the or angrejo kaa khan- paan or aadat alag thi
 For example, that bread was water, i
e
 their food was 70% readymade and packed food which came from Bidesh or from Britain and the British officers themselves used to pay from their salaries and there was no payment from the budget of Royal Indian Army
 lekin bhartiya sainiko kaa bhojan or khaane kii aadate purna rup se bhartiya thi or unako taaja bhojan kii jarurat hoti thi jo mukhya rup se bhartiya kichin me hi ban saktaa tha
 The second thing is that the British officers used to eat meat of both cow and pig which could not be made in the kitchen of Indian soldiers
 teesri baat unka alag bhojanalay kii bajah yah thi ki kyonki unke khaanaa free nahi tha jabaki sainikon ko rashan bilkul free tha or is vyavastha kii bajah se ki kahin free rashan me se koi adhikari apane liye bhojan kaa prabandh na kar le isaliye ek on duty adhikari ko chhodkar kisi adhikari ko bhartiya rasoi me janaa pratibandhit tha
 In today's conditions, while all the officers and soldiers are Indian, the food system is also Indian and the ration is also Indian and both are absolutely free, so the quantity and quality of food should be the same and the food should be made in one place and Of course, the dining table should be different
 
 
 
 Like found in an Indian restaurant
 kya aisi vyavastha bhartiya sena mai sambhav he or nahi sambhav ho sakati to kabhi bhi is desh me ekta kii duhai sirf bhaashanbaaji tak hi simat ke yaa phir ghoshnapatron me hi dabakar rah jaayegi
 This is my personal thought and maybe some people may not like this system change
 lekin vyavastha parivartan samay kii jarurat bhi he or is tarah ke parivartan samay samay par hote bhi rahe he
 In this way, a lot of change needs to be done within the country as well, such as the pension system for mps despite having a tenure of five years
 aakhir jab khud sarkaar ne april 2004 se sabhi kendriya va rajya karmchaariyon kii puraani pension vyavastha band kar di to phir yah saansad or bidhayak ko yah pension kis aadhaar par nyyochit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 i want all of us to be willing to raise such issues by giving up personal interest and thinking about the national interest and public interest through this forum, on every platform by becoming a strong man of the people, only then our real objective will be fulfilled

 After some introspection two or four special things emerge which were responsible for all this
 1) samaaj, dharm or rajkaaj karne logon kaa apana uttardaayitv or farz nibhaana or kaam ko naa karnaa or sara dhyaan is baat main laga dena ki kaise puri pranali ko aisa bana de ki bina kuch kiye sari malai unke paas aati rahe or unki aulad chaahe kitni bhi nalayak ho vahi uttaradhikari ho iske liye chaahe unhen kuch bhi karnaa pade or lobh kii sari simaaye paar kar puri pranali par is had tak kaabiz ban janaa ki puri vyavastha hichakanachur ho gayi
 2) Permanent caste system in which there is little freedom to change work
 jaise agar kabhi yuddh hota to bhi keval do pratishat aadmi hi yuddh karte baaki ko koi matlab naa tha
 How will one know whether caste system is the cruellest form of exploitation in a society
 iske kuch aayam hote hai, jaise 1) The first sign is that the upper and lower caste have different places of living, eating, playing and celebrating
 2) nichi jati vaale unchi jati ke samaaroh aadi main unke yahan khaanaa banaayenge, tent lagaayenge, baaja bajaayenge, unki vittiya vyavastha dekhenge magar samaaroh main shaamil nahin ho sakate
 But if in a drunken mood that a high caste person ever asks the worker for a function to have a drink or a meal, he will be praised in the whole society
 3) nichi jati vaale ke paas jimmevaariyon kaa tokara sar pe rakh uske pair chaude rahenge lekin uske paas adhikaar nahin honge
 If he is performing his responsibility in the best possible way, then what is he not taking money for? But if the mistake is made even by mistake, then public abuse can be threatened with gloom
 4) agar kabhi sapariwaar jansamooh ikaitha bhi hua to bhi is baat ko sunishchit kiya jaayegaa ki donon samoohon ke pahunchne, baithne, bartan aadi kii alag vyavastha raakhi jaaegi
 In any social context, the upper caste can threaten anything or nothing, which will have two consequences, at that time he will feel humiliated and humiliated, secondly his confidence will be low forever and in the social context he will find a poor corner and look out Someone will hear something somewhere
 nichi jati vaale se ye ummid kii jaayegi ki wo aata jaataa salaam to thokegaa hi saath main haath hi nahin puraa sharir jodakar khadaa hoga
 5) Even if the upper caste did not know their work, they remained in false faith, which remained a burden for the country and society, whereas it was full of potential with potential
 nichi jati vaala kaabil hote hue bhi hatotsahit hotantr or pranali ke liyekam utpaadak kshamta dharak hi rahaa
 And he was never in convenience but in dilemma about his existence
 6) is sabakaa parinaam ye hua ki hamaare samaaj kaa ek bada hissaa kam upjau or jugad hi karata rahaa or puure desh samaaj or tantra ne uskaa dansh jhela
 So friends, look at this in the context of our country and the current defense services
 kya hamaare adhikarigan laalach kii hadon ko paar nahin kar gayi hai? Are they not highly inefficient, ineffective, corrupt and characterless with no place for invention or innovation when DRDO, HAL, NAL
 DOCKYARD BEL BHEL aadi ko sahi feedbek tak nahin de sakate the or itnaa bada pratibhasampann desh sainik sajo saamaan kaa sabase bada ayatak he
 Due to the new kind of casteism, officers in army units are not forcing their soldiers to shoot
 itane zyadayudhpot or hawaijahaajon or pandubbiyon ke akasmaat nahin ho rahe? Before the overall system collapses, we have to play a catalytic role in saving the country, in establishing an efficient work culture so that India is once again the head of the world

 At the same time, sometimes our soldiers will be exposed to the same military service in the same disability pension on commission, and in the widow pension, injustice should be exposed to these issues as soon as they get the opportunity
 badi hi safai se general sahiban ham sainiko ke mul prashnon ko kabhi bhi media ke saamne nahin laate

 dodhia • khond • bhoi • rathva • Tantralok is a Tantric text composed by Abhinavagupta
 tantralok kii rachana hetu nimittbhoot shishy, sahyogi or paariwarik vaataavaran do kaarnon ne abhinavgupt ko tantralok likhane hetu sarvaadhik prerit kiya ve apane shishyon or sahpaathiyon jano dwaara atyant drudh or shraddhapurna nivedan tathaa apane guru ‘somashmbhu’ athwa shanmbhunath kii ajna vashwarshi hokar ek purna shastraroop tantralok ke lekhan hetu baghya ho gaye
 In the Abhinav Tantraloka epilogue, Tantraloka's creation is instrumental in mentioning his principal disciples
 inamen unke bhai manorath kaa sthaan sarvapratham aata he
 When Manorath Abhinav's Akhil Shastra Vimarsha became the only officer of full potential, at the same time, his other cousins also pleaded with Abhinav in a similar prayer
 inamen se souri ke putrmandra, kshem, utpal abhinav, chakrak, padyagupt or ramgupta kaa namollekh purvak vaarnit he
 Some others pleaded with Abhinav, whom Abhinav, a kind-hearted Acharya, could not deny, but his name is nowhere to be described
 paratrinshik vivaran ke upsanhaar shlokon me manorath, karn or utpal kaa naam liya gaya he
 Abhinav's brother Manorath was full of omniscience and Shiva's devotion
 karn yathaapi yuva the tathaapi ve sansaarik aakarshanon se dur hokar shaiva anushaasan main gambheer pravesh paa chuke the
 Karna along with Mandra had requested Abhinav to write a commentary on the 'malinivijayottara' system
 karn ke sansaarik vritti se sarvatha dur or apane naam ke anuroop gun vaale yogeshwaridatt naam ek putr bhi tha
 Karna's young wife, Amba, who was also Abhinav's sister, had entered into intense devotion to Shivpadapa, free from all locales after her husband died in her infancy
 yadhyapi ve abhinav se jyeshtha thi tathaapi ve abhinav ko guru maanati thi na ki unhen bandhu buddhi se dekhati thi
 Next we get a description of Ramgupta, who is called Ramdev in the innovative 'paratrinshika Description'
 paratrinshika vivaran ke anusaar ramdev vyakaran, mimasaa or tarkshastra ke nishnaat vidwaan the
 Abhinav's five cousins, who are described by Abhinav in the epilogue Shloken, entered the full devotion of Shiva, canceling all the deviations
 ham yah spasht rup main yah siddh nahi kar pate he ki anek prasiddh granthon or tikaaon ke lekhak‘kshebharaj’ unke chachare bhai kshem he athwa koi anya he parantu kuch paristhitj sakshya is tathy kii pushti karte he
 Abhinavagupta addresses all of them as 'pitruvya Tanayaah'
 abhinav tantralek me kahi bhi yah spasht nahi karte hai ki unke chachaa cone the
 Dr
 KC Pandey describes Vamnagupta as Abhinav's uncle on the basis of Abhinav Bharati
 jab ham abhinav ke guruon kii charchaa karege tab is vishay par punah prakaash padegaa
 Now we come to the temple, he will be a friend and cousin of Karna's childhood
 vatsalika jo kisori kii patni thi abhinav unhe bhandra kii chachee kehete hai tathaa jo ki kripapurna vyaktitva se yukt thi
 Abhinav was enamored with his gracious personality
 abhinav ne inhi kii kripapurna dekharekh, unke ek kaswe main sthit awaas apane saahitiyik srijan hetu upyukt sthal maan
 The concerted prayer of all these people forced Abhinav to create Tantraloka, as he could not reject that prayer in the same way that a dancer who is desirous of dancing cannot control himself during the playing of an instrument
 tantralok kaa sangrah sthal tantralok ek kaswein main sthit mandra ke awaas main likhaa gaya jahaan unki chachee vatsalika dwaara apane naam ko satyasiddh kartan hue unke prati apane sthh apane utyucch stareey granth ke lekhan main safal hue
 Acharya Abhinav's poet heart, every word of his poetry, filled with the repulsion of Batsalika, pours over Vatsalika
 vatsalika souri kii patni kii patni thi jo ki rajmantri the tathaa jo baad main shiv ke prati bhakthi se paripurna hokar apane baad se tyaagptr de diya
 Although Abhinavagupta gives sufficient details regarding his biography and circumstances, he does not give any direct indication regarding his time
 abhinav kaa sthitikaal abhrant rup se spasht nishchit he
 In this subject, we get some hints by Abhinav
 Sauri was the eldest and contemporary of Abhinav as his three generations in the later times appear to be Sauri Karna and Yogeshwari Dutt
 karn nishchit rup se abhinav ke samakaleen the
 Abhinav's sister was Amba's husband
 abhinav, karn kii mrityu pratyakshdarshi the
 Karna was a very curious disciple of Abhinav, along with Abhinav's relationship with Navat
 karn apeksha krit alpaayu main hi divangat ho gaye the jab unke putr yogeshwari dutt bade ho chuke the
 In 'paratrinshika Partika', he was the son of the narrated facts who were senior or prime minister in the meeting of Emperor Yashkar
 yashaskar kaa nishchit rup se gyaat he ki unka shasankaal 939 i0 main tha
 Abhinavagupta Samrat was writing the writing of Tantralok during the third generation of Yashaskar
 us samay ve sarvatha paripakv avasthaa main the
 And its accepted date is similar in 950 to 1025 AD
 tantralok kaa swaroop nidarshan kadachit ki tantralok acharya abhinavgupt kii sarvaadhik gambheer tathaa moulik kritiyon main anyatam he
 While he has commentaries on many important and contemporary or earlier works
 yahan ukt tathy ko tantralok rupi darpan main is prakaar sakate hai- The specialty of the tantraloka, from the interconnected and four-pronged view of the tantraloka, we have a very different form of vision from the grave subject
 lagbhag 12veen shatee ke rujuvimarshini ke lekhak ne ise ‘trickshastra’ athwa ‘triksaar shaastra’ kaha he or iske drushtaant ke rup ve tantralok kii hi panktiyaan uddhrut karte hai
 Therefore, it seems that by this time this book had become the most important text representing the triad tradition
 aa0 abhinavgupt ke prasiddh shishy kshemraj is granth ke vishay main do mahatvapurn tathy bataate hai- Abhinavagupta describes briefly in the Tantrasara that Tantraloka has Vedic method, from prohibitions to Shaiva, Tantra, Kul and Trik traditions
 yah tathy tantralok main baar-baar vistaarpurvak varnit he
 Ultimately, this form of Tantraloka becomes clear that this is the only exclusive and authoritative text presented by Abhinavagupta on the "trik-tradition"
 ‘tantrasaar’ ke anusaar tantralok na keval aagam parampara kaa kosh he balki vah tantra ke parsparik bhed gyaan or avaantar bhed ko sookshmatya vishleshit karanevaala ek aalochanatmak granth he
 According to Abhinav in the sound of the sound of the voice, the central sense of the Tantraloka revolves around the paramount power that has been called 'anuttara'
 tantralok kaa mukhya uddeshy vishay ko paribhaashit karte hue prakat karnaa tathaa uskaa vishleshan karnaa he
 Thus Tantraloc takes the form of a vaccine
 atev ise vaarthik, shloke vaarthik or shadardhashlokavarthik kaha gaya he
 Probably, the inspiration to give the name of Abhinavagupta to Katyayan came from the writers of Katyayan
 jahaan vaarthik ko ukt, anukt or durukt arth ke chintan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 It is clear that Tantraloka fully assimilates this definition
 Sometimes, Abhinavagupta calls Tantraloka a mixed form of all the vaccine-based variants
 is prakaar tantralok ek hi saath vaarthik bhashya or vritti kaa rup le letaa he
 Probably this is the reason that in the context of interpretation and analysis of some specific subjects, the Tantraloka is the authentic text
 is tantralok ko kahin-kahin ‘tantralok’ bhi kaha gaya he
 Abhinavagupta composed Tantraloka with diverse perspectives
 pratham or sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee kaaran uplabdh tantric sahitya tathaa parmparik tantragyan kaa vargeekaran karnaa tha
 Hence technically, Tantraloka is a collection book
 aa0 abhinavgupt kii rachana kaa moolbhoot uddeshy tantric stroton se hi nahin varan trik-bhinn parampara ko bhi aagam sahitya se sangruhit karnaa tha aa0 abhinav ne swayan is sandarbh main vichaar kiya he
 His clear objective was to present his ideas as the essence of the Agam tradition in which he proved to be the most suitable
 jiskaa jayrath ne aa0 abhinavgupt ko sangrkar kehete hue samarthan kiya he
 A
 Abhinav II but the most important objective was to present the process or method
 abhinavgupt vibhinn aagam siddhanton or paddatiyon main sarvshereshth rup main maanya anuttarashderdhakram parampara main kisi paddati or prakriya granth ke na hone se duhkhi the yah rikti ek chintya vishay thi
 In order to compensate for this, Abhinav decided to write the complete process book in every way
 yadhyapi aa0 abhinavgupt tathaa tantralok ke vivek tikaakar jayrath donon prakriya granth kii style ke sandarbh main spasht gyaan pradaan nahin karte hai
 However, Jayarath and Abhinavgupta's process books are full of information on the intended purpose
 is paripekshya main 4 nishkarsh uplabdh hote hai
 Now what does Tantraloka mean by process? Let's see this
 yadi ham tantralok ke pratham aahnik ke 14wein or 15wein shloke ko dekhen to yah pate hai ki prakriya or paddati shabd ek hi arth ko sanketit karte hai tathaa anya dhyatavya tathy yah he ki donon shabd ek vishesh varg ke granthon kii ore sanket karte hai
 Naturally, here the etymological meaning of the word process of grammaticalization is anakanksha
 vachaspatyam ke anusaar prakriya shabd kaa arth ek adhyay athwa krambaddharup prakaran he
 Whereas, according to Shabdakalpadru, the meaning of the word process is due method, thus here the method takes the form of a definite sense text
 vachaspatyam or shabdakalpadrup donon is tathy se sahamat hai or hemachandra kaa naam samarthan hetu uddhrut karte hai
 According to these lexicographers, the processual text reveals the process of a subject to express its intent
 tantralok ke sookshm adhyayan se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki aa0 abhinav kaa prakriya sambandhi siddhanth ukt prakriya kii paribhaasha ke ati sannikat he
 In Abhinavagupta Tantralok, the 'paratrishaika' is called the Anspraapriakra
 yah kathan hi paratrishikavivaran ko bhi prakriyagranth maanane hetu paryaapt he
 Abhinavagupta also uses the word 'process' in other places in the sense of 'sadhana'
 yah tathy tab or bhi drudh ho jaataa he jab abhinav svachhnd tantra kaa ‘prakriya se shreshth’ koi gyaan nahi he’ yah kathan udghrut karte he
 Jairath eliminates all doubts by clarifying the differences between systems due to process differences
 is prakaar yah spashtatah kaha ja saktaa he ki vidhi-nishedhathit tathaa vidhi-nishedhaatmak ubhay vishisht sadhana vidhiyon ko prastut karne vaale granth ko prakriya granth kehete he
 Abhinav, as is known, uses the second word method in this process sense
 parantu unki paddati kaa adarsh swaroop kya tha ? yah agyaat he tathaapi ve ‘ishanshiv’ kii ek paddati ko uddhrut karte hai jo ki paddati ke mul bhav ko prastut karti he tathaa jo devyayaamal granth main varnit hai
 This Ishanasiva is definitely different from the Gurudev method or the Tantra method, its author, Ishanshiva
 jo nishchit rup se 1073 i0 ke baad hue the
 According to Dr
 Ramchandra Dwivedi, the author of the book 'karmakandavali', Somasambhu was the supreme master of 'ishanshiva'
 kshemraj ke anusaar aa0 abhinav ke ek guru dharm shiv ne apratyaksh se is parampara main paddati lekhan kaa prarambh karte hue ek paddati likhi jise abhinav ne uddhrut kiya he kintu uskaa naam nahin bataaya he
 It is possible that the non-submission of various methods and one of them to their tradition was the cause of the misery of Abhinav
 ‘nath-sampradaay’ kaa prasiddh granth ‘siddhasiddhantapaddati’ jo ki bahut paraparti he jo ki ‘pratybhigna’ sampradaay ke uddharanon se paripurna he or saamaanya rup main paddati parampara ke granthon kii ore sanket karata he
 Thus it is logical to conclude that Tantraloka is a process or method book and 'trika' is a comprehensive regulatory text of life-view
 abhinav kaa tritiy uddeshy tantralok ko ek paripureshastra athwa shashan ke rup main prastut karnaa tha
 As in later times it became indeterminate form of process scripture
 atah jayrath aa0 abhinavgupt ko baarambaar shaastrakaar ke rup main samaran karte hai
 Jairath follows the classical form of Tantraloka at the beginning of his phrase and Vivek Tika
 chunki kisi bhi shaastra kaa anubandh chatushtya hota he atah jayrath bhi anubandh chatushtya kii sthapana karte hai jo is prakaar - 1
 vishay, 2
 prayojan, 3
 adhikari, 4
 sambandh
 Their serial description is as follows- iske atirikt prayek shaastra ke prarambh vighn nirasanarth karaniya mangalacharan rup stutivat yahan bhi ganesh tathaa batuka kii stuti kii gayi he
 Abhinav focuses on 'tantraloka' as a complete eulogy under his fourth last attempt
 ve apane upkram vaakya tathaa praarambhik prastaavna shlokon ke ant main or isi prakaar upsanhaar ke shlokon main kisi bhi prakaar kaa sandehavkaash nahin chhodte hai
 Whenever he gets the opportunity, he expresses Tantralok devotion and devotion
 unke netron main tantralok tab samgr swaroop sahit arth praapt karata he jab ve shaktipatombhishit shaivi bhavoplabdhi hetu unmukh hote hai
 Tantraloka describes both the path and process of this supernatural gesture with very clear ease
 thik utani sahajata ke saath, jitani kisi maanav kii dincharya kii style swayammev, sahajata se sampann hoti rahati he
 He climbs to the pinnacle of spontaneity, radiating his senses without ignorance, through eloquence, on the backy ground - "when one becomes possessed by this Shaivic sense, then the cloud of the thoughts of his heart automatically differs
 And in the light of the heart, the sun of the supreme form of knowledge rises or becomes bright
 tantralokakar kaa yah atyant bhavpurn kathan un navsaadhakon ke hriday main vishwaas kaa sanchaar kar unhen purnahambhavoplabdhi hetu agrasar kar detaa he jo sristimimasaa se upar uthakar tatva-mimasaa main rat hai
 It is only through this deeply devotional spirit that the procedural form of Tantraloka can be discussed
 sambhavtah isi drushtikon ko tantralok ke upkram tathaa upsanhaar main mahimanveet kiya gaya he
 Subtle study of Tantraloka gives us a clear sense of the purpose of Abhinavagupta behind this creation
 aa0 abhinav sarvapradhan uddeshy bhairaviy bhavoplabdhi athwa bhairav taadaatmayata kii samprapti he
 A
 Abhinav also proclaims that in the 37 parts of Tantraloka, the subject mentioned in the Tantraloka will be a continuous practice, and in the entire Tantraloka, the objective is not to be blown away by this purpose
 Specifying its atomic merger in the midst of the attainment of cosmic form by self-realization Newale the subsequent analysis of all the steps
 aa0 abhinav apni praathamiktaaon ko baarambaar kehete hue thakte nahin hai
 He states that his real commitment in Tantraloka is with the presentation of unquote
 gyaanachatushk jo ki mukti ke kaaran hai unki ruparekha samast vishwatmbodh or purnahambhaav ke udai hetu banaayi gayi he
 A
 Abhinava cites the sound of Thalayanoka that the central sense of Tantraloka is the accomplishment of that invisible Parameshwara Bhava
 aa0 abhinav ke anusaar ek maatr shaktipaat hi mumuksh kaa sanchaalak bal he
 They are most conscious of the solution to the problem of freedom from bondage
 yatha aa0 abhinav yah spasht karte hue aage badhate hai ki tantralok multah swatmapratyabhigyaan rup pratibhasanvitti gyaapak he
 Due to the complete realization of the practice of sensing this person, the person becomes 'pratibha Guru', by whose mere 'grace-sarcasm', the whole world can attain Bhairava identity
 aa0 abhinav or tantralok ke tikaakar jayrath donon ise apni kriti kii prashansa karnaa nahin maanate hai varan kehete hai ki ukt kathan yatharth he
 The presentation of Tantraloka brings to the fore the other authoritative other motive
 aatmasaakshaatkaar samast aadhyatmik sampradaayon kaa charam lakshya he or iskaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn kaaran aatmavimarsh he
 In this supreme personal achievement, the reason for the different texts other than Tantraloka is not enabled
 aa0 abhinav kii swathmsanvitti, heyopadey nirnay main amogh karanroop sartak, samast shaivashaastra par purna adhikaar or trik-parampara kaa gahan gyaan, yah sabhi usee anuttar tatva kii disha main unmukh hai or sabhi paraspar sanyukt hokar aa0 abhinav ke pratipaadan ko gahan gammbhiry or atyant vistaar pradaan karte hai
 Three levels are attained until any knowledge level is attained
 jayrath ek apratyaksh sanket dete hai ki aa0 abhinav kaa bauddhik tathaa aadhyatmik vaibhav, unke shastramukhagam-nijanubhavsiddh swathmsanvitti rup purna gyaan se yukt vishwatm vyaktitv ko prakat karata he
 Not under certain circumstances, but actually Tantraloka is an idealized and authentic text that presents the sacra tradition
 aa0 abhinav tantralok dwaara tantric vidhiyon or gyaan kii saral prastuti ko tritiy uddeshy maanate hai
 Keeping this point in mind, he made the same subjects and concepts the subject of his discussion
 jisase sab log labhanvit ho saken
 He gave a simple explanation, presenting the contentious issues
 tantralok ke dhyanpurvak avlokan se sankalan ke prishthbhumirup aa0 abhinav kaa ek or uddeshy drusht hota he jise ati saavdhaanee purvak sthapit kiya gaya he
 'he is the regulation and protection of the sacra system
 ’ unke teen udaahranon main se tantralok ke prarambh main pratham ‘sampradayochhitaih tathaa maghy main shesh do ‘vidambita’ tathaa bhrashtavidhuh unke is drushtikon ko purnatah spasht karte hai
 From the very beginning, Abhinav informs that some people who were scholarly in the scriptures but could not be attained Trikgyan due to being non-traditional
 dwitiya udhaaharan kaa taatpary yah he ki kuch log aise bhi the jinhone na to shastradhyayan kiya or na hi maardarshak guru kii pratiksha athwa khoj kii
 Thus, they were easily confused
 tritiy uddhran se yah sanket miltaa he ki kuch parmparik gyaan ke vishisht tathaa aavashyak ang yaa to lupt ho gaye the athwa in vikrut ho gaye the ki unke mulswaroop kaa anveshan asambhav ho gaya tha
 In the first and second stages, A
 Abhinav used his traditional knowledge and intellect
 In the third stage, he used 'nyas-vidhi' as other options, which is called 'malini'
 jayrath tantralok ke pareekshan purvak yah mat vyakt karte he ki aa0 abhinav jahaan bhi kisi aagam parampara or mat ko uddhadhrut karte he tab ve uske prati vipareet or bhram-purna avadharana ko khandit karte he or use uske yatharya swaroop main apni adwitiya medha dwaara santhaapit karte hai
 In this way, we enrich the knowledge related to the said source
 is vivechna ke anantar ham is nishkarsh par pahonchte hai ki abhinav ke uddeshy main se ek adhoshit uddeshy uplabdh tathaa parmparik tantric sahitya or sadhana ko punerjeevit karte hue bhavishya ke liye surakshit karnaa tha
 In this context, some more facts can be said, examining their style and methods
 purv varnit tathyo par dhyaan dene se ham abhinav ke udveshy or prayoso ko do virgo main baat sakate hai pratham 1
 ghoshit 2

 The main chamber is domed and double-storey in height and consists of a tomb of the second Mughal emperor Humayun in a lattice enclosure with eight ridges in the very middle below the dome
 ye imaarat kii mukhya kabr he
 Its entrance is on the southern side with a single EVAN, and the evans of other directions have a network of white confluence

 In these small rooms, the tombs of many Mughal Nawabs and courtiers are built from time to time
 inamen se pramukh hai hamida bano begum or daara shikoh kii kabren
 Including the first floor, this main building has more than 100 tombs, most of which do not have the identity of the person buried due to the inscription, but it is certain that they are from the royal family or courtiers of the Mughal Empire
 Were, so the building is labeled as the cemetery of the Mughals
 is imaarat main laal baluapathar par shwet sangmarmar ke sangyojan kaa sarvapratham prayog kiya gaya tha
 Along with this, there are many components of Indian architecture, such as small canopies of Rajasthani architecture enclosing the main dome, which were originally covered with blue tiles

 The central water pipe from the main gate to the mausoleum seems to go under it and reappear from the other side, just as the 'garden of paradise' is described in the verses of the Quran
 makbare ko ghere hue charbagh hai, va unhen ghere hue teen ore oonchi pathar kii chaharadivari he va teesri ore kabhi nikat hi yamuna nadi baha karti thi, jo samay ke saath parisar se dur chali gai he
 Central walkways lead to two gates: one main gate in the southern wall and the other small gate in the western wall
 ye donon dwaar dumanjila hai
 Of these, the western gate is now used, and the southern gate used to be in the Mughal period and is now closed

 The chief monument of these is the tomb of Isa Khan Niazi, which was built in 1547, 20 years before the main tomb
 isa khan niyazi mughalon ke viruddh ladane vaala sur vansh ke shaasha shershah suri ke darbar kaa ek afgaan nawab tha
 This tomb was built during the life of Isa Khan and after that it worked for his whole family only

 After this comes the Arabian inn which was built by Hamida Begum for the artisans engaged in the construction of the main mausoleum
 is parisar main hi afasarvaala makbara bhi bana he, jo akbar ke ek nawab ke liye bana tha
 Along with this, its mosque is also built

 It is called Messier 31, M31 or NGC 224 and is often referred to in texts as the great Andromeda Niharika
 andromeda sarpilaakaar tara punj, hamaari sabase nikatatam akashganga he lekin kul milakar yah sabase nikatatam taramandal nahin he
 It can be seen as a stain on the moonless night, it can be seen by objects far away from the naked eye, and can also be seen in urban areas with binoculars
 iske naam ko us akaash kshetra se liya gaya he jahaan yah prakat hota he, andromeda nakshatramandal or jiskaa naam puranic rajkumaari andromeda ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Andromeda is the largest galaxy in the local group consisting of Andromeda galaxy, Milky Way galaxy, Triangulum galaxy and 30 other minor galaxies

 Viewed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope, it has been found that M31 contains billions of stars, many more than our planetary planets whose number is about c
 200-400 billion
 
 While in 2006, the galaxy's planets were estimated at ~ 80% compared to Andromeda, which is roughly equivalent to 7
1 × 1011 solar planets, a 2009 study showed that the density of Andromeda and the Akash Ganga is roughly the same

 In other star paintings of the time it was inscribed as Little Cloud
 doorabeen dwaara avlokan kiye jane ke aadhaar par is grah kaa pehla vivaran german khagolvid simon marius dwaara 1612 main kiya gaya
 Charles Messier listed it as the M31 planet in 1764 and was erroneously credited as an explorer to Marius, who was unaware of Sufi al's earlier work
 1785 main, khagolvid wiliam harshal ne M31 ke pramukh kshetra main dhundhlee laal rang varna kaa ullekh kiya
 He believed that it was closest to the "great Nebula" and based on the color and size of the nebula, he miscalculated that it was no more than 2000 times larger than Sirius' distance
 1864 main wiliam hagins ne M31 ke varnakram kaa avlokan kiya or yah paaya ki yah gasiy nebula se bhinn he
 The spectra of M31 form deep absorption lines exhibiting a continuum of frequencies as layers that help identify a chemical mixture of a substance
 andromeda nebula bahut adhik alag taron ke spectra ke samaan tha jisase isaki utpatti hui jisamen M31 kii taarakeey prakruti thi
 In 1885, the supernova was first seen in the M31, which was seen only once in this galaxy
 us samay M31 ko sabase nazadiiki grah mana gaya tha, isliye vastu paas tha ek vichaar karne ke liye he, isliye is kalpana ko bahut adhik lokapriyata nahin mil saki or is asambaddha ghatana ko nova kaha gaya or iskaa naam "nova 1885" ke anusaar rakhaa gaya
 The first photograph of the M31 was taken by Isaac Robert in 1857 at his private observatory, Sussex, England
 lambii avadhi ke khulaase ke baad tarapunj kii sarpilaakaar sanrachana ko pehali baar dekha gaya
 However, at that time it was generally considered to be a nebula in our galaxy and Robert mistakenly thought that the M31 and similar spiral nebula were in fact the form of the structure of the solar system that was taken with the help of satellite Nessant planets
 hamaari saura pranali ke sambandh main is grah ke trigyakaar veg ko 1912 main vesto slifer dwaara lowell vedhashala main, spectroscopy kaa upyog karke mapa gaya tha
 As a result, at that time, its velocity was recorded very fast in the direction of the sun at 300 kilometres per second

 Curtis observed that the average size of those novices was 10 times the size of the novices in Tarapunja
 jiske parinamswaroop use anumaanit 500,000 prakaash varsh duuri se dekha ja saktaa tha
 So he became the proponent of the so-called "island universe", the spiral nebula that was actually an independent galaxy
 1920 main, harley shorpale or curtis ke bich akaash ganga, sarpilaakaar nebula or brahmad ke aayam se sambandhit mahaan bahes aarambh ho gai
 In support of the claim that the great Andromeda Nebula was externally tarapunz, Curtis observed the texture of dark lines resembling foggy clouds in our tarapunj and observed a characteristic doppler shift
 1922 main, arnest opic ne M31 kii duuri ke akalan kaa ek bahut hi sundar or saral khagoleey vidhi prastut kii
 He placed our Tarapanja at about 450 KPC from Andromeda, which is about 1500 KLY
 edwin hoobal ne is bahes kaa aarambh 1925 main kiya jab unhone pehali baar M31 ke khagol chitra ke liye akaash ganga ke pare vibhinn cefeid taron kii pahchaan kii
 These were taken using the 2

 Andromeda played an important role in the study of galaxies, as it is the closest spiral galaxy
 1943 main, walter bade andromeda akashganga ke kendriya kshetra main taron kaa samaadhaan nikaalane vaala pehla vyakti tha
 Based on observations of this galaxy, based on his observations about it, he was able to identify two stars based on their metallicity, namely the high-velocity stars in the Young Disc Type i and the Type II reds emerging in the Old Age
 Stars

 Dr
 Bade also discovered that there are two types of galaxies which are twice the size of M31 and other stars of the universe

 The measured distance to the Andromeda galaxy was doubled in 1953 when it was discovered to be the second slowest type of galaxy

 Particularly visible are the common stars compared to the M31 galaxy and the estimated brightness of M31 is ~ 2
6 × 1010 l ☉ 25% higher than the brightness of our galaxy
 haalanki, akashganga main taare ke gathan kii dar M31 kii tulana main kaaphi adhik he jisamen akashganga kii tulana main 3-5 saura pindon kii tulana main keval ek saura pind prati varsh utpann hone ke baraabar he
 The rate of supernovae in the galaxy is almost double that of M31

 In 2005, astronomers used the Keck Telescope to show that the shimmer of stars moves outside the galaxy, which is actually a part of the main disk
 iskaa matlab he ki andromeda main taron kii sarpilaakaar discs pichley anumaan kii tulana main teen guna adhik badi he
 Continuous evidence suggests that it has a massive stellar disk that increases the diameter of the galaxy by more than 220,000 light years
 isse pehle, andromeda ke aakaar kaa anumaan lagbhag 70,000 se 120,000 prakaash varsh ke asapas tha
 The Milky Way is tilted about 77 ° to one side of the Earth
 Analysis of the galaxy's oblique cut shape reveals a much clearer, S-shaped tilt than the flat disk
 is tarah ke jhukaav ke sambhavit kaaran M31 ke paas upgrah akashganga gurutvkarshan ho saktaa he
 Some inclination is possible due to M31 in the galaxy M33, although it depends on its exact distance and radius velocities
 spectroscopy adhyayan ke antarvaaag main M31 ke vibhinn ghurnan veg vaali maap kii vyakhya kii gai he
 Close to its core, various 1,300 light-years have been observed at a radius of light-year with a high rotational velocity of 225 kilometres per second and then a minimum drop of 7,000 light-years with a rotational velocity of up to 50 kilometres per second
 
 uske baad uske veg main nirantar 33,000 prakaash varsh trigya tak kii vruddhi hoti jaati he, jo shirshatam 250 kilometres per second tak pahunch jaati he
 As the distance increases, its velocity declines, with a possible fall of 200 kilometres per second to 80,000 light years

 Its two trailing tail-like arms separated each other at least 13,000 light years from each other
 unhen moolbhag lagbhag 1,600 prakaash varsh duuri se faili hui dikhaai padati hai
 Its spiral is mainly believed to come in contact with M32

 In 1998, the European Space Observatory could display images of the European Space Agency infrared space observatory images in transit to the annular galaxy
 andromeda main gas or dhul kai valyakaar swaroop banate hai, jo vishesh rup se iske moolbhag se 32,000 prakaash varsh trigya ke saath valay ke rup main banate hai
 This ring is hidden from the visible light images of the galaxy as it is composed mainly of dust made of cold dust

 Following this, it is found that the small galaxy passed along Andromeda's disk along the polar axis of the latter
 Its collision caused more than half of the smaller M32's bodies to break apart and create a ring ring in Andromeda
 M31 ke bade hue prabhamandal ke adhyayan se pataa laga ki isaki tulana akashganga ke saath karnaa sambhav nahin kyonki taron ke prabhamandal main aamtaur par "aparyaapt dhaatu" hoti hai jo duuri badhane ke saath-saath badhati chali jaati hai
 These evidences show that both galaxies follow the same evolutionary path
 unhone pichley 12 arab varshon ke dauraan 1-200 nune-drayman vaali akashgangaon kaa aatmsaat yaa samavesh hua he
 In the extended halo of M31 it is possible to increase the distance between the stars and the galaxy by about a third of the separation of the two galaxies

 In a larger telescope the visible effect of a star embodied in more extended magnification creates
 cendrak kii chamak adhik chamkile golakaar jhund kii adhikta he
 In 1991, Todd R
 Lear used the WFPC and was later set up to take images of the inner nucleus of Andromeda to the Hubel space telescope
 cendrak main do sanyojaktaayen hai jo 1
5 parsek dwaara alag kii jaati hai
 The luminous valence is designed in P1, equivalent to the galaxy center
 P2 kii dhundhlee sanyojaktaa akashganga ke centre main sthit he or 3-5x107m☉ blike hole sthit he
 Scott Tramanne suggested that the interpretation of the observed double nucleus is possible if the P1 central black hole had a projection of the image of the star in the focal chamber around the stars
 uski utkendratha is prakaar kii he ki taare kakshiya apocenter se jude rahete hai jinke kaaran taron kii abhimukhataa main vruddhi hoti he
 P2 has a dense disc of hot spectral class a stars

 Whereas, at the time of its initial discovery, it was hypothesized that the luminosity of the double nucleus was the remaining part of the small galaxy "cannibalized" near Andromenda, after which there was no clear explanation
 iskaa mul kaaran yah he ki is prakaar ke cendrak kaa kendriya blike hole dwaara utaar-chadhaav vaale vyavdhaan ke kaaran jeevankaal atyadhik chota ho jaataa he
 While partially resolving it is possible if P1 has its own stabilizing black hole, the upheaval in P1 does not mean that it has a black hole at its center

 About 460 spherical masses are related to the Andromeda galaxy

 It has several million stars and has twice the brightness of Omega Centauri, known as the brightest spherical beam in the galaxy
 globular 1 main kai taarakeey sankhya bahut adhik he or saamaanya golakaar ke liye inaki sanrachana bahut adhik saghan hoti he
 As a result, some consider G1 to be a small part of a small galaxy that was considered M31 some time ago
 globular kii sabase adhik spasht chamak G76 ke samaan he jo uske purvi bhaag main dakshini-purvi bhaag main sthit he
 In 2005, astronomers discovered a completely different type of star mass in M31
 khoja gaya nayaa tara punj main karodo taare shaamil thim or inhen vartulakaar punjon main iske samaan sankhya main anya taare khoje ja sakate hai
 What makes them different from circular groups is that they are larger - several hundred light years larger - and many times less dense than them
 isliye, taron ke bich duuri haal hi main khoje gaye vistaarit punjon main kaaphi adhik he
 Similar to the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy consists of satellite galaxies numbered 14 smaller galaxies
 sabase acchhee jaankaree vaali or sabase adik dekhi jane vaali upgrah akashganga M32 or M110 hai
 Based on current evidence, it appears that the M32 has a very close encounter with the M31
 M32 kabhi bahut badi akashganga rahi hogi jiske baad M31 ne iske taarakeey bimb ko hataa diya or iske antarbhag main taare ke nirmaan main badi teji ke saath vruddhi hui jisaki samaapti uske baad ho gai
 The M110 may also have come into contact with M31, and astronomers discovered metal-rich stars in the M31's halo that appear as lines from these satellite galaxies
 M110 ke dhul nahin he jo haal kii or vartmaan taare kii banaavat kii taraf ingit karata he
 In 2006, it was discovered that nine of these galaxies are parallel, dividing the core of the Andromeda galaxy rather than arranging their independent interactions randomly
 This may indicate a normal tidal origin for satellites
 andromeda akashganga, akashganga kii taraf 100 se 140 kilometres per second teji se bad rahi hai, isliye yah sthanantarit hone vaali neeli akashganga main se ek he
 The Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way are expected to collide after perhaps 450 million years, although its description is uncertain because the relevant velocity of Andromeda can only be compared to the Milky Way based on one or two components
 is takkar ke parinamswaroop ye akashganga ek vishalkay andakaar akashganga rup main parivartit ho jaaengi
 akashganga ke samooh main akashgangaon ke bich is tarah kii ghatnaayen aam baat he
 No information is yet available about the collision between the Earth and the Solar System
 yadi akashganga aapas main villin nahin hoti hai, to ho saktaa he ki saura mandal akashganga se baahar rakhaa ja sake yaa andromeda se jud sake

 Tirumavalavan or weighment
 Tirumavalavan, a Dalit activist, is a Member of Parliament in the 15th Lok Sabha and the current president of the Vidalai Chirutagal Kutchi, a Dalit political party in the state of Tamil Nadu, India
 ve 1990 ke dashak main ek dalit netaa ke rup main prasiddh hue or 1999 main unhone raajnneeti main pravesh kiya
 Their political base focuses on preventing caste-based oppression of Dalits, which they believe can only be achieved through reviving and redirecting Tamil nationalism
 unhone srilanka sahit anya sthanon main tamil rashtravaadi andolanon or samoohon ke liye samarthan bhi vyakt kiya he
 Tirumavalavan was the second child of Tolkappian and Periyamal and was born in the village of Anganur in Ariyalur district, Tamil Nadu, India
 unke pita ne aathvin kaksha tak adhyayan kiya tha, jabaki unki maa ashikshit rahi

 He started organizing rallies, boycotts and conferences to support the Sri Lankan issue
 unhone madras lau college kaa chakkar lagaaya, lekin asafal rahe
 This, he said, was reportedly due to his being a Dalit
 is ghatana ke baad unki mulaaqaat tamilnadu kii ek pramukh raajnneetik party, dravid munetra kadgam ke party netaaon se hui
 In 1988, while working in the Government Forensics Department in the southern city of Madurai, he met the Tamil Nadu State Convenor Malachami of the Dalit Panthers of India, an organization fighting for the rights of Dalits
 agle saal malachami kii mrityu ke baad, thirumavalwan ko dipiai kaa netaa chunaa gaya
 He created a new flag for the organization in 1990
 apane kaam ke hisse ke rup main, unhone madurai kshetra ke dalit gaanvon kaa daura shuru kiya or daliton ko pesh aa rahi samasyaon ko samajhnaa shuru kiya
 The killing of two Dalits in 1992, he says, made them more militant

 The politics of Thirumavalavan is based on redefining Tamil nationalism, which seeks to convert it into a force for the abolition of the caste system
 ve kehete hai ki daliton kaa utpeedan, bharat main sansthagat he, jisamen tamilnadu bhi shaamil he
 Although the Dravidian parties that dominate Tamil Nadu politics are ideologically committed to the abolition of the caste system, Thirumavalavan argues that those people have in practice fallen away from the core ideals of the Dravidian movement
 ve kehete hai ki unki nitiyon ne mukhya rup se madhya jatiyon ko hi labhanvit kiya he or vastav main daliton ke utpeedan main vruddhi kii he jahaan atyaachaari rup main brahmanon kii jagah madhya jatiyon ne lee he
 Dalits cannot and should not expect much help from Dravidian parties
 thirumavalwan ke anusaar, samaadhaan tamil rashtrawaad main he
 They say that caste oppression can be eliminated by just raising resistance from the grassroots level, arousing Tamil sentiments, as Periyar E
V
 It took place in the early days of the Dravidian movement under the guidance of Ramasamy
 agar tamilnadu main ek sahi sarkaar gathit hoti he, to jati utpeedan turant gaayab ho jayega
 Thirumavalavan is also a staunch critic of Hindu nationalism, especially of Hindutva
 According to Thirumavalavan, Hindutva is the essence of the oppressive Indian state
 unka tark he ki hindutv ne dharm ke madhyam se tamil samaaj ko uttari bharat ke saath mishrit karne kaa kaam kiya he
 From this, they say, the Tamil people have lost their identity
 unki drushti main, jaateey tamil rashtrawaad, hindutv kaa muqabla karne ke liye aavashyak he
 Thirumavalavan's view on the importance of Tamil identity has led him to support Tamil separatist groups in Sri Lanka, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a war-torn separatist group formally designated as a terrorist organization in India
 Has been banned in

 ek kamishnari apostolic ek cancersri he, jo pope dwaara niyukt kiya gaya he, isliye adhimaani apostolic
 The practice of appointing such commissions by the Holy See is a very ancient example
 a notable example is the commission issued by Pope Celestine I, to St
 Cyril of Alexandria in the early part of the fifth century, by which to judge Nestorius in the name of the Pope The Holy Patriarch had authority for, among other examples, the divorce of King Henry VIII Tudor in English history
 Representatives of the Commission, Joe Cardinal Wolsey and Cardinal Campaggio Pope, were represented for the judicial hearing
 kabhi kabhi apostolic aayogon ko holi si dwaara sthaayee rup se gathit kiya jaataa he cardinal kii adhyakshata main vibhinn roman kaliciaayein is prakaar hai The full range of authority of commanderies Apostolic must learn from the diploma of their appointment
 haalanki, jin saamaanya praadhikariyon ke paas he, unhen carch ke saamaanya kanoon main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 Commissions can be empowered not only for judicial but also for executive purposes when a Pope commission expressly refers to certain persons and certain things subject to the authority of the Commandery, and is then generally stated as " Other persons and other things ", it is understood that the latter phrase refers only to those persons and things which are expressly named The powers of the Commissary are higher or more respected than those done, and under no circumstances is the power of the Commissary higher or more respected if a bishop is appointed a minority apostolic in matters relating to his general jurisdiction, Does not give the authority to which he already possessed; One such apostolic commission is called 'agitated', not to change it, its ordinary jurisdiction
 ek kamishnari apostolic ke rup main holi si kaa ek pratinidhi he, pope ko unke faisle yaa prashasnic krityon ke khilaaf apil kii ja sakati he
 When several Commissioners have been appointed for the same matter, they are to act together as one; But if, by death or any other reason, the act of one or other commissaries should be interrupted, the remaining members have full power to execute their commission
 yadi ayog sankhya sankhya main do hote hai or unhen die jane vaale faisle main asahmat hoti he, to holi si dwaara yah nirnay liya janaa chahie
 a minority Apostolic has the power to subdue another person for a cause committed to him, unless he is explicitly stated in his diploma that, due to the importance of the issue in issue, he is in his jurisdiction Have to exercise in person
