 ) The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is taking every possible step to win in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, so that the party can benefit
 narendra modi ke kareebi or party ke uttar pradesh maamalon ke prabharee amit shah ab un pratyaashiyon kii khufia report banane main jute hai, jisase panel main shaamil ummidavaaron kii sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak kriyakalapon kii puri jaankaree mil sake
 With the selection of candidates for the general election, the BJP is making a ruckus in the selection of its candidates
 bijepi ke ranneetikaron kii maane to party nahin chaahati ki kisi aise pratyaashee kaa chayan kar liya jaae, jise party netaa hi nahin balki bhaajapa kaaryakarta hi asweekaar kar den
 If BJP sources are to be believed, the party also wants to know how their image is in the public about the number of contenders from a Lok Sabha seat
 loksabhaa ummidavaaron kii nakaaratmak or sakaaratmak donon pahaluon ko dhyaan main rakhkar khufia report taiyaar karai ja rahi he
 According to sources, if the party feels that the negative aspect of a candidate is overshadowing its positive aspect, then its claim can also be terminated
 party ke ek padaadhikari ne bataaya ki is uljhan se baahar nikalne ke liye shah ne ek aisi khufia team taiyaar kii he jo un netaaon or loksabhaa ke daavedaaron ke sach kaa pataa laga rahi he, ki janata ke bich unki chhavi kisi he, ve janata ke bich kitne lokapriy hai or janata ke bich kitna kaam kar rahe hai
 Sources reveal that this intelligence team is examining the party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's rally as well as the activism of BJP workers
 is team kii report par hi party main kaaryakartaaon kaa bhavishya tay hoga
 This team is also engaged in knowing the ground reality of its workers in the party
 team modi kii reliyon main har kaaryakarta or netaa kii sakriyata ko parakh rahi he or apni report ek website ke jariye pahunchaa rahi he
 a senior party leader, on the condition of anonymity, said that the party is blowing every step regarding the Lok Sabha elections
 har loksabhaa seat par jin naamon kaa panel taiyaar kiya gaya he, un sabhi ummidavaaron ke vyavhaar, janata ke bich unki upasthiti or janata ke bich unki chhavi kya he, jaisi tamaam jaankariyaan ekatra kii ja rahi hai
 When asked by this senior leader whether these teams were acting on Shah's instructions, he said that apparently being in-charge of the party, every tactic is being used in his consultation only
 party ke sutara bataate hai ki yah team party ke kuch varisht logon ke hi sampark main hai, jo modi ke karibiyon ko har jile kii vaastavik report se avgat kara rahe hai
 Here, the opponents are not missing out on a pinch about the candidates' intelligence report being made

 In Rajasthan, bjp's tough leader Ghanshyam Tiwari has been facing difficulties
 bijepi ne ghanashyam tiwari ko anushaasanheenata kaa kaaran bataao notice bhejte hue 10 din main jawaab maanga he
 Complaint with Central Discipline Committee: Senior leaders of BJP win the assembly elections in Sanganer, Jaipur with the most votes, but Tiwari, who was a minister many times, was not given a place in the cabinet this time by Vasundhara Raje
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje se ghanashyam tiwari ke 36 ke aankaden rahe hai
 But unhappy with not being made a minister, Tiwari continued to attack Vasundhara Raje indirectly or sometimes indirectly
 tiwarika pradesh bijepi ke netaaon main kad itnaa bada he ki kabhi kisi ne inke khilaaf khulkar nahin bolaa
 But BJP state president Ashok Parnami, close to Vasundhara Raje, complained to Tiwari with central discipline
 das din main maanga jawabaiske baad kendriya anushaasan samiti ke adhyaksh ganeshi laal netivariko notice jari karte hue kaha ki aap pichley do varshon se lagaataar party ke viruddh gatividhiyon main hissaa le rahe hai or party ke khilaaf bayaanbaji kar rahe hai
 It also stated that Tiwari is constantly absent in party meetings and shares the stage with opposition parties
 tiwari par deen daayal vahini naam se samanaantar raajnneetik manch bhi khadaa karne ke aarope lage hai
 The notice stated that Ghanshyam Tiwari continued to ignore it despite informing him about the anti-party activities
 notice main kaha gaya ki das din ke andar anushaasan samiti ko apana jawaab bhejein nahin to party unke khilaaf koi bhi nirnay lene ke liye swatantra hogi
 In fact, Tiwari has been trying to surround the government on all issues with the opposition even inside the assembly
 khaskar un muddon par zyada hamalavar rahe hai jo sidhe vasundhara raaje se judaa hon
 Even demanded secret ballot of mlas against Vasundhara Raje
 tiwari ke is krity ko party ne party samvidhan kii dhara 25 (c) ke tahat anushaasanheenata mana he
 Ghanshyam Tiwarika says that he has not yet received notice
 unhone kaha ki notice milane par hi kuch kah paaungaa
 But the way in which the party has served the notice, it is clear from the fact that it will not be easy for Ghanshyam Tiwari to remain in the party

 There is always a sheet of darkness on the capitals and this is more applicable in the case of Delhi
 aap hawaaon ke badalte rukh ko yahaan akaash main udati chizon ke sahare nahin pahchaan sakate
 For that you will have to go to the villages where the real voter lives and read the writings written on the walls there
 dilli main to bas hawa ko jaraa zyada saavdhaanee se soonghney kii jarurat he or thodaa thahar kar
 If you have the experience to notice and the windows of your mind are open, you will be able to feel the change
 har badlaav haalanki behatari ke liye nahin hota, phir chaahe vah aapaki hi baat ko sahi kyon na tehra rahaa ho, jisase aap daawa kar saken ki dekho, maine kaha tha na!upie-2 kii mutthi se rajkaaj kii ret jab phisal rahi thi or uski prashasnic jameen par jab dusron ko naachne kaa mauka mila tha, vah daur 2010-12 ke bich kaa tha
 At that time, i saw how the three institutions of this country, the judiciary, media and civil society had become accustomed to spread out of their sheets
 karypalika kii khaali kii hui jagah ko kabjane ke liye us vakt teenon main hode-si much gai thi
 This was also expected because the system always hated emptiness, but it was also unnatural because the executive had to take back his place late in the morning
 aisa ab jaakar hua he or jaisaa ki maine kaha bhi tha, teenon ko sidhe gardan se pakad liya gaya he
 This week, three such incidents should be noted, which are not interlinked and are from different regions
 pehali, desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish ne pradhanmantri kii achaanak saraahna karke sabko chaunkaa diya
 Initially it was criticized in suppressed language, then vocal voices were heard
 duusari ghatana paryaapt apratyaashit he jisamen greenpis sanstha kii ek varisht kaaryakarta priya pillai ko landan yatra par jane se imigration main hi roak liya gaya jabaki un par videsh yatra kii koi kanoonee pabandi nahin thi
 There was some opposition to this but it remained confined to the activist community
 teesri ghatana filmkaar pankaj butalia se judi he jinhone sensor board dwaara kashmir par apane vruttchitr ko pratibandhit kiye jane ke khilaaf supreme court main apil kii thi or adaalat kii khandpeeth ne sunwaayee main unhen koi raahat die bagaiyr tippanee kii, ‘‘yah film ekatarfa kyon he? pataa nahin ekatarfa baat karnaa aajkal kyon fashneble or maanavadhikaar se judaa maamla ban gaya he
 "the question becomes that even if a far more unilateral side had a film made by the Government of India, would the honorable court have raised the same point? It is not my aim to question these three incidents this week
" darasal teenon ghatnaayen shuruaati prasthaapana ko hi sthapit karti hai
 As i said, the judiciary, media and civil society, all three will be caught by the neck
 in teenon ko baadhya kiya jayega ki ve karypalika kii us jagah ko khaali karen jis par inkaa atikaraman he
 During the UPA rule when the executive was weak, they were given an open exemption
 inhen ab apane puraani khohon main laut janaa hoga, lekin aisa karte vakt inkaa naitik ksharan hoga
 This is not only dangerous for any democracy, but the most dangerous for a country which is as diverse as it is, is also inclined towards the extremism of the majority
 chauthai sadi se zyada samay ke baad jab hamaare yahaan karypalika itani shashakt he, aise main yah hona chahie tha ki ye sansthaaen utani hi majboot hotin lekin pichley kuch dashakon ke dauraan aaj agar ye sabase patali haalat main hai to isaki jimmedaar ye khud hai
 The constitutional democracy of India is built on the principles of division of rights and control and balance
 yah acchhee baat he ki jab koi sanstha kamjor padati he to uski jagah lene ke liye duusari sansthaaen aa jaati hai lekin yah kaam vinamrata or sahishnutaa ke saath hota he, yah maanate hue ki yah vyavastha aswabhaavik or asthaayee he
 First of all, on the judiciary, this week i made that statement of one of the most respected judges of the Supreme Court (T
 in the Kapila Hingorani Memorial Lecture in Delhi)
 es
 Thakur) is also willing to accept that when there is administrative deficiency, the judiciary has to fill its place
 haalanki main yah tayshuda taur par nahin kah saktaa ki kai nyaayadhishon ne khud ko is seemaa ke bheetar rakhaa he
 i have written on this subject before also for this reason when some of the benches started showing proud aggression
 ek ne sarkaar se kaha, ‘‘hamen gussa aa rahaa he’’, to duusare ne pradhanmantri karyaalay ko hi aade haathon le liya
 Mining leases and spectrum licenses were canceled at wholesale prices, innocents and convicts were hauled off with the same sticks and new judicial units and comfortable posts were quickly established
 inhen main ek neshnal green tribunel he jisane aisa lagata he ki khud ko sarvocch adaalat ke taur par ghoshit kar daalaa he or jis tareeke se vah apane farmaan sunaae ja rahaa he (dilli se 15 saal puraane saare vaahanon ko hataaya jaae), use kaayade se tughluqabad main hona chahie tha
 It is to be noted that the judge who was angry with the previous government has accepted a good post after taking leave from this government
 pichley sijei ko rajyapal bana diya gaya to maujuuda mukhya nyaayadhish ne media ke samaksh pradhanmantri kii prashansa kar daali
 Obviously, these are his personal views and he has his own opinion as to who he should vote for, but think it over once
 agar kisi maujuuda mukhya nyaayadhish ko yah lagata ki pradhanmantri ekadam bekaar he or yah sarkaar nikammi he, or usne ghar par press ko bulaakar yah baat kah di hoti, tab kya hota?mujhe sarvocch nyaaypalika kii aalochana main saavdhaanee baratani chahie kyonki meri manshaa aisa karne kii nahin he
 My concern is that the judiciary should remain strong, strengthen its moral strength and do not fall into any political greed or fear
 is maamle main nyaaypalika ne apni kamajoriyaan dikhaai hai
 This is the reason why the historic constitutional amendment restoring the old supremacy of the executive over the judiciary passed within 24 hours in both houses
 isse ladgaye kii bajaae ab hamen bhuri-bhuri prashansaaen sunne ko mil rahi hai
 An interesting fact has to be noted here
 is samvidhan sanshodhan par hamalaa karne vaale or supreme court main use chunauti dene kaa vaada karne vaale sheersh nyayavid vahi kaddavar fali nariman hai jinhone ek baar phir mukhya nyaayadhish dwaara pradhanmantri kii saarvajanik saraahna kii bhi khuleam aalochana kii he
 Remember, too, that he has the moral strength to do so because he had openly challenged the Emergency when he was the additional Solicitor General of the country at a very young age, regardless of his job
 media kii sthiti to or vikat he
 When the conditions were favorable for him and the government was paralyzed, then we got used to hearing threats, sermons, accusations, etc
 on him everyday
 tab tathyon ko bagaiyr jaanche pesh kiya jaataa or ghotaalon ke aakaar main manmarjee shunya laga die jate the
 Concocted stories were also shown, as was done in the Adarsh scam case and we were told that the land belonged to the widows of Kargil
 aaj yahi media pradhanmantri ke saath selfi lene ke liye doharaa hua ja rahaa he
 Shashi Tharoor, who has not been accused so far, is having more fun to follow him, while the blame for murder and rape is hanging over his head and we are going to let a saffron clown who is doing vulgar nonsense dividing the society
 Are giving enjio or naagarik samaaj to upie ke raaj main chutta ho gaye the or khaskar uske duusare kaarykaal main to sarkaar ko hi nirdeshit kar rahe the, har nai pariyojna ko roak rahe the or jahaan kahin sidhi ungali se kaam nahin banataa tha, vahaan adaalaton kaa sahaara le rahe the
 Prohibition on bauxite mining in Niyamgiri eventually despite many clearances, game of hide and seek in the name of POSCO clearance, restriction on power plants on Brahmaputra river, mining of uranium to Kudankulam and other planned nuclear plants or raising the height of dam on Narmada Activists won every battle, from banning the research of biocultured seeds
 inhone aisi ati kar di ki ab inke liye logon main koi sahanubhuti nahin bachi he
 Today the situation is that all these institutions are almost unconscious and alert
 ek baar apana raaj chale jane ke baad in foundation anudanit sansthaaon ne ab tak koi khaas saahas nahin dikhaaya he
 Nandan Nilekani himself was a UPA man, despite this, from the government's favorite volunteer workers to some bureaucrats sitting in the Planning Commission tried to stop the Aadhaar card scheme at every step
 aaj narendra modi kii sarkaar sidhe pradhanmantri karyaalay kii nigaraanee main use puure josh ke saath lagu kar rahi he or sara virodh nadaarad he
 He has added LPG cash subsidy from Aadhaar and has been proudly proclaiming it in one minute long TV commercials
 ab kahaan hai aadhaar ke virdohi? ho saktaa he ki ekaadh baar greenpis kaa koi kaaryakarta virodh karata dikh jaae, lekin usase kya hi fark padataa he
 The government has stopped the grants to ngos and now there is no sympathy among the public about them
 kisi bhi loktantr main jo swatantraaaen maujuud hoti hai, ve vaidhanik praavdhaanon samet us saamaajik anubandh kii bhi upaj hoti hai jo saamaanya taur par sansthaaon kaa desh kii janata ke saath hota he
 When the executive was weak, the judiciary, media and civil society became very powerful, aggressive and obstructive
 aaj is sthiti ko janadesh durust kar rahaa he
 And remember that in any democracy, public opinion does not work as softly as homeopathy
 yah kisi sarjan ke aujaaron kii tarah krur dhang se kaam karti he
 Since the old social contract has been eroded, the judiciary, media and civil society will have to protect themselves
 philhal to sthiti yahi he ki in teenon sansthaaon ko jhukne ke liye kaha gaya tha or ye rengne lagi hai
 For this reason, we call them such paper tigers who once roared

 Cricket World Cup this year or IPL to be held in the country after that
 inke dauraan bollywood nirmaataa nidar hokar apni badi-badi filmein release kar rahe hai
 This year the Cricket World Cup starts from 14 February which will run till 29 March
 is bich sabase pehle ranbir kapur kii film 'roy' 13 farvari yani worldcup se ek din pehle cinemagharon main utregi or 20 farvari ko varun dhawan kii film 'badlapur' release hogi jab worldcup kaa khumaar aasmaan par hoga
 Anushka Sharma's first film as a producer, "NH-10" will be released nationwide on 6 March
 matlab yah ki anoushka jaisi nai nirmaataa bhi worldcup ke dauraan apni film ko release karne se nahin dar rahi hai
 The IPL will begin in India after the World Cup and in the meantime many big films are being released
 ipel-8 april se shuru hokar 24 may tak chalegaa
 And the first to challenge it will be "detective Byomkesh Bakshi" at the box office
 ye film nirdeshak dibaakar banerjee kii he or sushant singh rajput mukhya bhoomika main hai
 Amitabh Bachchan and Deepika Padukone's film "piku" will hit theaters when the IPL is in its best shape
 or 15 may ko ranbir kapur starer anuraag kashyap nirdeshit film "bombai velvet" cinemagharon main pradarshit hogi
 One was the period when filmmakers could not muster the courage to release their films during World Cup or IPL
 is dauraan keval chote bajet kii choti filmein hi release hoti thi
 But in 2008, when the IPL started, producer Mahesh Bhatt dared to release his film 'jannat' and got success
 usase pehle 1999 ke worldcup ke dauraan nirmaataa vaashu bhaganani ne himmat dikhaakar film "bivi na
 1 "and was also a big hit, yet the big producers would clash with cricket
 magar pichley 2 se 3 ipel sizan main jisane himmat dikhaai us par cricket kaa koi asar nahin padaa
 And Bollywood understood that if the film is weak then it will never be successful and if the film has its own power then cricket cannot harm it
 lihaaza ab nirmaataaon ne apane dil or dimag se cricket kaa dar nikaal diya he
