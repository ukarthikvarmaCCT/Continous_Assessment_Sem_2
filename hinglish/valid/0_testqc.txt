 After years of study, when Albert Einstein announced this theory in 1916, the world of science was stirred up and the universe's vision announced in 1687 by Isaac Newton was permanently reversed for two and a half years
 bhautik shaastra par iskaa itnaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa ki log aadhunik bhautikee ko shastreey bhautikee se alag vishay bataane lage or albert oinstin ko aadhunik bhautikee kaa pita mana jane laga
 Dik is a Sanskrit word meaning place around
 ise angreji main "spes" kehete hai
 Humans have the ability to steam the three aspects of a problem - top-down, forward-backward and right-left
 aam jivan main manushya dik main koi badlaav nahin dekhte
 Newton's physics used to say that if two objects in space are one kilometer away from each other and neither of them move, they will remain one kilometer away from each other
 hamaara rose kaa saadhaaran jivan bhi hamen yahi dikhalaataa he
 But Einstein said that it is not so
 dik khich or sikud saktaa he
 It is also possible that the two objects which are one kilometer away from each other, should not move themselves, but due to some circumstances the problem may spread to a quarter and a quarter or a quarter to a quarter
 newton kii shastreey bhautikee main yah kaha jaataa tha ki brahmand main har jagah samay kii raftaar ek hi he
 If you are sitting in one place and a friend decides to travel for ten years at half the speed of light, then after that journey, you will have passed ten years and your friend too
 lekin inastin ne is par bhi kaha ki yah vishwaas galat he
 When something moves at a speed, time becomes slower for it and the faster it moves, the slower it becomes
 aapkaa mitra agar apane hisaab se das varsh tak roshni se aadhi gati par yatra kar ke laut aae, to uske to das saal guzarenge lekin aapke saadhe gyaarah saal guzar chuke honge
 Einstein showed in the theory of relativity that in fact there is a four-dimensional dikala in the universe, consisting of three periods of time and one in which all things and energies are located
 yah dik-kaal sthai nahin he- na dik bina kisi badlaav ke hota he or na yah zaruri he ki samay kaa bahaav har vastu ke liye ek jaisaa ho
 It can be twisted, pulled, and shrunk by affecting the time period, and the same happens in the universe
 is siddhanth ke madhyam se hi samay yatra kii avadharana nirmit hui he
 The change in time produces every object and every speed, but large objects and speeds near light produce more changes
 manushyon kaa aakaar itnaa chota or uski raftaar itani dhimi he ki unhen saapekshata siddhant ke asar apane jivan main nazar hi nahin aate, lekin jab vah brahmand main or chizon kaa gaur se adhyayan karte hai to saapekshata ke chinh kai jagahon par pate hai
 When the velocity of the object becomes even 5% of the velocity of light, then we start to see the signs of the theory of relativity
 newton kaa maananaa tha ki har vastu main apni ore khinchne kii ek shakti hoti he jise usne gurutvkarshan kaa naam diya
 In a big thing like Earth, this gravity is very high, due to which we stick to the Earth and do not fly away from space in space
 lekin yah newton nahin bataa paye ki gurutvkarshan bal vastav main kis prakaar kaary karata he or kyon kaary karata he
 Einstein said that according to the theory of relativity, the idea that material things attract each other is an illusion, which has arisen due to wrong mechanical assumptions about nature
 unhone kaha ki prithvi badi he or uski vajah se uske ird-gird kaa dik-kaal mud gaya he or apane upar tah ho gaya he
 We live in this difficult time and because of this twist, we are pushed closer to the earth
 isaki tulana ek chadar se kii ja sakati he jiske chaar cono ko chaar logon ne khinch ke pakadaa ho
 Now if a heavy ball is placed in the middle of this sheet, then the sheet will sit in the middle, that is, its yarn will be bent in the middle
 ab agar ek halaki gend ham chadar ke kone par rakhe to vah ludak kar bade gole kii taraf jaaegi
 Einstein said that a clumsy man could see that the small ball was pulled by the big ball, so the ball went to him
 lekin asli vajah thi ki gend zamin kii taraf janaa chaahati thi or gole ne chadar main kuch aisi mudan paidaa kii ki gend uske paas chali gai
 Similarly, he said that it is a myth that gravity is caused by some attraction
 gurutvkarshan kii asli vajah he ki har vastu jo antariksh main chal rahi hoti he, vah dik ke aisi mudan ke prabhaav main aakar kisi badi chiz kii ore chalane lagati he
 In fact, gravity is only a part of inertia, the movements of stars and planets arise from their characteristic inertia and their path depends on the circular elements of time and time
 jis prakaar chumbak ke chaaron ore chumbakeey kshetra hota he usee prakaar khagoleey vastu apane chaaron ore ke akaash main ek kshetra bikherti he
 Just as the activity of an iron piece in a magnetic field is guided by the design of the field, similarly the path of an object in a gravitational field is determined by the geometric state of that field
 oinstin kaa gurutvkarshan sambandhi niyam dikkaal satati ke kshetreey tatwon kii jaankaree detaa he
 Primarily a part of this rule expresses the relationship of the structure of the field around the gravitational object
 inastin ke is sansani failaa dene vaale siddhant kaa ek bahut bada pramaan roshni par gurutvkarshan kaa asar dekhne se aayaa
 Newton's theory in physics was that two objects pull each other according to the mass of the two
 lekin prakaash kaa to dravyaman hota hi nahin, yani shunya hota he
 So, according to Newton, there is no question of something that does not have any mass or weight, but it can be pulled from the gravity of another object, no matter how big the other object is
 prakaash hameshaa ek sidhi lakeer main chalata hi rahata he
 But if Einstein is right and due to some big thing, the problem should be turned, then the light should also be turned with difficulty
 yani brahmand main sthit badi vastuon ko lens kaa kaam karnaa chahie- jis tarah chashme, doorabeen yaa sookshmbin kaa lens prakaash modta he usee tarah taron or grahon ko bhi modana chahie
 In 1924, a Russian physicist named Ostra Kholson predicted Einstein's theory of relativity, predicting that such gravitational lenses would be there in the universe
 pachpan saal baad, 1979 main pehali dafaa yah chiz dekhi gai jab twin kwasar naam kii vastu kii ek ke bajaae do-do chhaviyaan dekhi gai
 After that such images of far-flung objects have been seen in which some very large object is placed between those objects and the earth, which acts as lenses on the rays of light coming from the first object and either torsion its image
 Or show more than one image of him in the sky
 kafan premchand dwaara rachit kathasangrah he
 It compiles 13 other stories along with Kafan, the final story of Premchand
 pustak main shaamil prayek kahani maanav man ke anekadrushyon, chetana ke anek chhoron, saamaajik kuritiyon tathaa aarthik utpeedan ke vividh ayaamon ko sampoorn kalaatmakataa ke saath anaavruth karti he
 The Kafan story is quite different from other stories of Premchand
 unke kahani-sansar se iskaa sansar sarvatha nisanssang he, isliye unki kahaniyon se parichit logon ke liye yah anbujh paheli ho jaati he, premchand ke sambandh main bani hui purvavarti dharna ke aahe prashrachihn laga detii he
 This is a story about values
 aadhuniktaa ke saare mudde isamen mil jate hai
 This is the first story of modernism
 yahi kaaran he kuch vidwaan ise pragativaadee kehete hai to doindranath madan kaa kahana he-kahani jis satya ko ujagar karti he vah jivan ke tathy se mail nahin khaataa
 Kafan is the story associated with Premchand's point of life beyond which there is no point
 dobchchan singh ke matanusaar- yah unke jivan kaa hi kafan nahin siddh hui balki unke sanchit aadarshon, mulyon, aasthaaon or vishwaason kaa bhi kafan siddh hui
 While Dr
 Paramanand Srivastava says that 


 Kafan is the first new story in Hindi, it is completely modern because it has neither the familiar idealistic realism of Premchand, nor the pre-scriptural notion, nor the fabricated instrumentals
 As the characters are, no culmination, no climax, no shallow sentimentality and exaggeration, nor any direct communication
 vah lekhak ke badale hue drushtikon or kahani kii badali hui sanrachana kaa thos udhaaharan he
 It starts like this - both father and son are sitting silently in front of an extinguished bonfire at the door of the hut and inside, the son's young wife Budhia was outpacing childbirth
 rah-rahakar uske munh se aisi dil hilaa dene vaali awaz nikalati thi ki donon kalejaa tham lete the
 It was a winter night, nature was immersed in silence, the whole village was turned into darkness
 jab nisang bhav se kahata he ki vah bachegi nahin to madhav chidhkar uttar detaa he ki maranaa he to jaldi hi kyon nahin mar jaati-dekhakar bhi vah kya kar legaa
 It seems as if at the beginning of the story, Premchand is gesturing in a symbolic manner and the sentiment is getting dark in the dark as if there is a deepening darkness of the capitalist system which rises from the ruthless sense of all human values, harmony and intimacy Is going
 is aurat ne ghar ko ek vyavastha di thi, pisai karke yaa ghaas chhilakar vah in donon bagaiyraton kaa dojakh bharti rahi he
 And today both of them are waiting that if they die, then sleep comfortably
 akashavriti par jinda rahane vaale baap-bete ke liye bhune hue aaluon kii keemat us marati hui aurat se zyada he
 None of them wants to go to see him for fear that another man will eat all the potatoes after he leaves
 halak or taalu jal jane kii chintaa kiye bina jis teji se ve garm aalu kha rahe hai usase unki maarak garibi kaa anumaan sahaj hi ho jaataa he
 This discrepancy is ironically associated with the entire structure of the story
 ghisu ko bees saal pehle hui thakur kii baraat yaad aati he-chatnee, rhita, teen tarah ke sookhe saag, ek rasedaar tarkari, dahi, chatnee, mithai
 Now, what should i tell you about the taste of that meal? 


logon ne aisa khaaya, kisi se pani na piya gaya
 


 yah varnan apane byore main kaaphi aakarshak hi nahin balki bhojan ke prati pathakeey samvednaa ko dhardaar bana detaa he
 After this Premchand writes - and Budhia was still moaning
 is prakaar thakur kii baraat kaa varnan amanviyata ko thos banane main puri sahaayta karata he
 The Shroud is the story of a social system that discourages man towards labor because he does not show any significance of that labor
 kyonki jis samaaj main raat-din mehnat karne waalon kii haalat unki haalat se bahut-kuch acchhee nahin thi or kisaanon ke mukaable main ve log, jo kisaanon kii durbalataaon se laabh uthaanaa jaanate the, kahin zyada sampann the, vahaan is tarah kii manovriti kaa paidaa ho janaa koi achraj kii baat na thi
 


 Even then, he was aware that if he is in trouble, then at least he does not have to work hard for the farmers
 uski saralata or nirihata se duusare log beza phayda to nahin uthaate
 For twenty years, this system keeps a man without food for his stomach, so it is not necessary that he has to worry more than a member of his family to die
 aurat ke mar jane par kafan kaa chanda haath main aane par unki niyat badalane lagati he, halke se kafan kii baat par donon ekamat ho jate hai ki laash uthte-uthte raat ho jaayegi
 Who watches the shroud at night? The shroud is burnt with the corpse
 or phir us halke kafan ko liye bina hi ye log us kafan ke chande ke paise ko sharaab, pudiyon, chatnee, achaar or kalegiyon par kharch kar dete hai
 From the satisfaction of their food, both of them imagine the salvation of Budhia - if our soul is happy, will it not get happiness
 jarur se jarur milegaa
 God, you are the conscience
 use baikuntha le janaa
 The happiness of our soul is necessary first, there is a need for the happiness of the world and God even later
 apni umr ke anuroop ghisu zyada samajhadaar he
 He knows that people will arrange the shroud - even if the money does not come in his hand this time
 When Madhav starts crying while thinking of the immense suffering of his wife, Ghisu silences her - using our traditional knowledge that She is freed after dying
 or is janjaal se chhot gayi he

 janata dal kaa gathan 30 oktober 2003 ko janata dal ke sharad yadav gut, lokshakti party or samta party ke vilay ke baad kiya gaya

 fatima jinnah maadar-e millat yani janata kii maan, qaayade aazam ke jivan main maadar-e millat unke hammer uh prabhavi rup se 19 saal rahen yani 1929 se 1948 tak or mrityu shuukravaar ke baad bhi itnaa hi samay jivit raheen
 Our expert historian Ausajya has given a very high position to Maadar Milat as the sister who takes care of quaid-e-azam's house, but he has not paid much attention to the amazing effects he has left on the political map of Pakistan and especially after 1965
 yah ek sarthak baat he ki kaayade ajam ke jivan main maadar millat unke hammer uh prabhavi rup se 19 saal rahen yani 1929 se 1948 tak or mrityu shuukravaar ke baad bhi itnaa hi samay jivit raheen yani 1946 se 1967 tak lekin is duusare daur main unki apni vyakti kuch is tarah ubhari or unke vichaaron bhoomika kuch is tarah nakhre kar saamne aae ki unhen baja liye kaayade ajam kii loktantric 'be baak or paardarshee raajnneetik mulyon ko aazasar nau jivit karne kaa shrey diya ja saktaa he jinhen shaasha bhul chuke the
 In this connection, the prayers expressed by Madar Miltat show his strong hold on contemporary political science and affairs to the extent of unswerving faith
 1965 ke raashtrapati chunaav ke maukey par ayyub khan kii aalochana ke jawaab main maadar millat ne khud kaha tha ki ayyub sainya maamalon kaa visheshgy ho saktaa he lekin raajnneetik samaj or fraasat maine kaayade ajam sidhe praapt he or yah aisa kshetra he jisamen amar bilkul naa deshaantar he
 The events arising after 1965 are enough to corroborate this statement of madamalat
 udhaaharan ke maadar millat ne jin khataron kii baar baar pahchaan kii unamem se kuch hai: The details that Madarmalat gave to warn Noah of other national and international affairs and warn of the threat posed by the government and the public represent his distant eyes and political visionaries
 agar ham ni maadar millat ke rubaru kat anatabah par kaan dhare hote or khataron se bachane kaa aayojan kiya hota jo unki nigahen saaf taur par dekh rahi thim to aaj ham kattarpanthi raajnneetik, aarthik or saamaajik bahraanon kii chapet main na hote jo hamaare raashtra raat or din saamana kar rahi he or yah baat to sunishchit maaloom hoti he ki purvi pakistan kaa daliraash ghatana site vikasshil na hota
 Regardless of the manner in which he spent nights and days and the sacrifices he made for the nation and Muslims, Madar Miltat's political life is certainly a factor in his ideal role
 in karkon main paanch vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai:pehla: vah ek adarsh garillo mahila thim

 By estimate, this no
 Must be circa 1777

 Apart from 'kavikul Kanthabharan', he finds no other poetry; Only a few footbal poems are available, which will be the remnants of some of his poetry books
 inkaa kavikul kanthabharan alankaranirupan ke liye rachit hua he
 Just as Appaya Dixit's 'kuvalayananda' has been considered the best for newcomers in Sanskrit, in the same way, both these books in Hindi have been honored by Maharaj Jaswant Singh's 'bhashabhushan' and Kavivar Matiram's 'lalit Lalam'

 The method of Matiram and Dulah is different from that

 This resulted in more leisure time than the couplets were able to explain the signs and examples and the difficulty of memorizing them due to the nostalgia of the larger verses

 Acharyas Das, Dev etc
, who collected many organs from Satakavi; The poet, Matiram, Bhushan, etc
, and the ornate, can be interpreted as Jaswat Singh, Doolah, etc
, the author and author of the subject of speech
 ' The rhetorical acharyas of Hindi have not been able to explain the difference between the divinities of divination, partly due to the presidency of Brajbhasha and partly because of the selection of short verses like couplets
 kintu dulah ne iske liye uttam paddati apanaai ki unhone ek hi vaakya main ek alankaar ke sabhi bhedon ke udhaaharan de die
 Somewhere there is difficulty for the scholars, where they have put the signs and examples of one ornament in half of the same verse and the other in the other half, the characteristic and example of the other; But overall this book is unique from all points of view in the Ritikaalin Alankar texts
