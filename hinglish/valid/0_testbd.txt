 Resentment among students According to research scholar Imran, he had only raised the issues of the student, he did not have the intention to tarnish the university's image, yet giving such a notice only when talking in the media is like hurting freedom of expression

 At the same time, spokesman of Jamia Millia Islamia University Mukesh Ranjan told 'aaj Tak' that the student did not report the lack of chairs in the library and waterlogging around the hostel area during the rainy days in the Student Welfare
 agar chaatr ne aavedan diya hota to vishvavidhyalay tunrat karrwai karti
 According to the administration, the student made a statement in the media by not making the university aware of the problem, which is a contempt of the university rules
 chaatr ko sirf shokoj notice diya gaya tha, koi sajaa nahin di gai
 At the same time, the student has also responded to Shokaus
 baharhaal, chaatr kaa jabaav milte hi vishvavidhyalay ne notice waapas le liya
 But the question is, why did the students need to go to the media, if the notice was not withdrawn after coming to the court

 Meanwhile, an important point has emerged that another new AIIMS could not be created in Bihar as the Nitish government could not allocate land for the second proposed AIIMS in the state for four years
 iske baad bharat sarkaar ne darbhanga medical kalege and hospital ko hi ames kii tarz par apgrade karke kaa faisla kiya
 It is significant that on 28 November 2014, the Ministry of Health decided to upgrade 39 hospitals in the third phase of PMSSY, including Darbhanga Hospital

 Surprisingly, four years ago the Modi government announced the opening of another AIIMS in Bihar, but the Bihar government could not provide the necessary space for it
 saal 2015-16 ke apane bajet bhaashan main tatkaaleen vitt mantri arun jetali ne bihar main ek nayaa ames kholane kaa elaan kiya tha
 After this, the Health Ministry repeatedly requested the Bihar government to give information about 3-4 alternative places, but for four years Nitish government could not identify it
 19 disambar 2017 ko rajya sabha main die likhit jawaab main swasthya rajyamantri ashvini choube is baat kii pushti kar chuke hai
 Giving detailed information about the status of the 13 newly proposed AIIMS, he told the Rajya Sabha on the proposed new AIIMS in Bihar - "the state government has been requested to identify 3-4 alternative places to open a new AIIMS in Bihar
 , But the state government has not yet identified alternative locations
 "jab rajya sarkaar ne jameen nahin di to tatkaaleen swasthya mantri jepi nadda ne loksabhaa chunaavon se thik pehle do march, 2019 ko patna main darbhanga hospital ko duusare ames ke tarz par viksit karne kaa elaan kar diya
 There was news that Minister of State for Health Ashwani Choubey wanted to open a new AIIMS in his stronghold Bhagalpur while Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was not ready for this
 buudhvaar ko aayush maamalon ke kendriya mantri shripad nayak ne enditivi se kaha agar bihar sarkaar ne samay par zamin de di hoti to aaj bihar main ek nayaa ames ban rahaa hota or dimagi bukhaar jaisi bimariyon se ladane kii kshamta or majboot hoti
 It is clear that the result of not getting land is that a new AIIMS could not be formed in Bihar

 ferj kiijie ki koi katl hone vaala he or kaatil katl karne apane shikaar ke paas pahunch jaataa he
 After this, he first tells his victim the way to kill himself
 itnaa hi nahin katl hone se pehle wo baqayada usee se uske katl kaa vaisaa hi reharsal karaata he or kamaal ye ki katl hone vaala khushi-khushi wo sab kuch karata jaataa he jo use kaatil karne ko kahata he
 Finally, without killing the killer, he is literally killed
 is tarah ke haroonges katl ko upi ke sapa netaa sudhir yadav ne anjaam diya he
 Sudhir is the state secretary of up's ruling party SP
 sudhir kii patni kii laash fande se lataki he, usee ke ghar main neeche stool jameen par gira hua he, log ro-bilakh bhi rahe hai
 This is not a case of suicide but of direct murder
 aap kahenge wo kaise? to suniye apane gale main fanda kas kar maut ko gale lagane kaa kaam beshak is mahila ne khud kiya ho, lekin ye maut uski marzi se nahin, balki kisi or ke kehane par hui he
 That is, the noose tightened itself, climbed on the stool itself, then pushed the stool itself and dropped it
 magar ye sab isane marane ke liye nahin kiya tha, balki jeene ke liye kiya
 The story is of Kanpur city and this story has four characters
 ek netaa, duusari uski bivi, teesri premika or chauthaa ek tantric
 On one hand, the wife wanted to regain her husband's love by defeating her husband's lover
 vahiin, mashooqa apane aashiq kii bivi ko hi raste se hataanaa chaahati thi
 The two were completely unaware of each other's conspiracy and this unknowingly begins the plot of this amazing murder
 duniya ke is sabase ajeeb murder mistry kii buniyaad ek prem trikon yani lav triangal ke upar rakhi gai
 According to the police, Sudhir had met Ruby, a bank officer living in his own locality some six years ago, but soon this formal meeting, deep friendship turned into love again
 ab netaji kii ankhon par pardaa pad chukaa tha
 He spent less time at home with his wife Bina and more time with sweety ruby
 kehete hai ishk or musk chhipaae nahin chhipate- netaji ke saath bhi yahi hua
 Through the tongue-in-cheek world of her husband's love affair, Sudhir's wife also reached Bina and then, as is usually the case
 binaa or sudhir ke bich rubi ko lekar jhagadon kii shuruyaat ho gai
 This merge medicine was the same, that Sudhir should stay away from his beloved Ruby, but neither Sudhir nor Ruby accepted this
 lihaaja, jaise-jaise vaqt gujara teenon ke bich tanaav bhi lagaataar badhata rahaa or phir iske baad ek roj sudhir kii mashooqa rubi ne jo saazish rachi, wo behad kaufanaak thi
 Ruby joined Bina, a tantric expert in black ilm, who had a good demand in the city to get Bina out of the way
 ye tantric tha, baba akbar shah
 Baba Akbar had found a golden egg laying hen in the presence of Ruby in the evening
 rubi aksar uske paas apni fariyaad lekar pahunchati or baba har baar use tantra-mantra ke sahare binaa kaa kaam tamaam karvaa dene kaa jhansa dekar moti rakam vasuul letaa, lekin jab vaqt zarurat se zyaada lanbaa ho gaya, to rubi ne akbar shah par dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya or tab ant main akbar shah ne rubi se uske aashiq kii bivi yani binaa ke katl ke liye chalis hazaar rupee kii supaari uthaa lee
 Now Baba assigned his most trusted disciple named Mridul and the tantric to put Bina in hiding, but for this Tantric Mridul had to enter Bina's house
 use bharose main lenaa tha or yaheen is katl kaa asli plat taiyaar hua
 Now Ruby began to ask and understand every detail of her house from her lover Sudhir
 masalan, ye ki ghar main kis roj kya pakaa, kya khaaya, kya pahana, kis baat par ladaai hui, koun aayaa, koun gaya
 Et cetera
 idhar, sudhir ye baaten rubi ko bataata or udhar rubi sari baaten mridul ko, lekin tantric mridul ne inhen choti-choti baton ke sahare sudhir kii patni binaa ke dimag par apni aisi chhap chodi ki bina bilkul uski divaani ho kar rah gai
 Now the tantrik often started coming to Bina's house
 use usee ke pati se pataa chali baaten bataane laga or phir inhen baton kii badaulat apane tantrashakti kaa ahsaas karwaane laga, lekin iske baad usne binaa ko jaise apane ishaare par naachne ko majaboor kar diya
 In fact, she had told Bina that she would pull her husband Sudhir back from the clutches of Ruby because of his tantric powers
 sudhir phir se usase pehle kii tarah pyaar karne lagegaa, lekin iske baad jo kuch hua, wo kisi ne nahin sochaa tha
 The betel nut was killed, the murderer had reached the victim
 phir wo vakt bhi aayaa, jab kaatil ne apane shikaar se uske katl kaa reharsal karavaaya
 The rehearsal was completed according to the killer
 ab bas reharsal ko hakeekat ko badalanaa tha or uske liye final tech lenaa tha
 Final take ie Murder
 tantric mridul kaa ab sudhir kii gairmaujuudagi main aksar binaa ke paas aana janaa shuru ho chukaa tha
 With the intention of regaining her husband's love, Bina would call Mridul to her, whenever Sudhir was not in the house and taking advantage of the opportunity, Mridul spread the trap of Bina's house tantra-mantra, which continued to grow
 Was going mridul ko apane guru yani bade tantric baba akbar shah se pehle hi binaa ko raste se hataane kaa hukum mil chukaa tha or mridul aisi tarkeeb nikaalane main laga tha, jisase saanp bhi mar jaae or lathi bhi naa toote or akhirkaar uske dimag main wo tarkeeb bhi aa hi gai
 Now Mridul asked Bina for tantra-mantra in the name of reducing the effect of ruby in Sudhir's mind
 usne tantric kriyaaon ke naam par kai baar binaa ko gale main fanda daal kar stool ke sahare khadey hone ko kaha or jab-jab binaa fanda daal kar khadi hoti, wo binaa ko stool dhakel kar gira dene kaa hukum detaa
 Bina had trust in Mridul
 jo har baar apane pairon se stool giraanevaali binaa ko tham kar uski jaan bachaa letaa
 In this way, Mridul was rehearsing Bina's murder and Bina was considering it a tantric action, but there was another conspiracy going on in Mridul's mind and then one day it happened, which no one thought about
 mridul ek roj binaa ke ghar pahunchaa or tantric kriya ke naam par usne binaa ko gale main fanda daal kar stool par chadha diya
 According to Bina Chadhi and Ravayat, she also dropped the stool from her feet, but this time Mridul betrayed her
 yani stool ke girane par jaise hi bina ke gale main fanda ksaa, mridul peeche hat gaya
 She started to suffer and got cold within a few seconds and thus Bina was killed
 ek aisa katl jo hua to kaatil kii ankhon ke saamne, lekin kaatil ne makatool ko haath tak nahin lagaaya
 At first glance, even the police thought it to be a case of suicide, but when the investigation went ahead and came to know about the relationship between Sudhir and Ruby, the whole story became clear
 donon ke kol ditels police ke liye ahm suraag sabit hue or dhire-dhire rubi or tantric or unke chelon kii shakl main paanch log is maamle main giraftaar ho gaye
 However, in this case, the police has given a clean chit to Bina's husband, Netaji Sudhir Yadav, and there are many questions about this

 RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat released a report on women: a study of the study included women from 29 states and 7 union territories
 Mohan Bhagwat said - Men cannot decide the path of development of women
 The largest survey has been conducted to know the situation
 yah survey 1081 tiimon main bantakar desh bhar main nikaleen mahilaon ne kiya he
 The survey was prepared after talking to more than 74 thousand women in 485 districts of 29 states and seven union territories of the country
 timen naksali aria kii adivasee mahilaon tak bhi pahunchin
 The team had to make a lot of papad to persuade the tribal women to negotiate
 kai-kai baar sampark karne ke baad mahilaon ne survey ke liye taiyaar prashnon kaa jawaab diya
 Women from 70 districts out of 106 along the international border were also included in the survey
 is survey main 21
 96 percent were unmarried girls and the remaining married women
 survey kii pariyojna nideshak manisha cotekar ne daawa kiya ki apni tarah kaa yah pehla bada survey he
 He said that to know the status of women, such a questionnaire was prepared for this survey, which took at least two hours for the interviewer to give and answer
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne survey main sansad kii standing cametiyon main mahila chairman ke na hone ke sawaal par kaha ki main yah nahin kahati ki kaabil mahilaayein nahin hai
 But women have to come out of the rest zone and come forward themselves
 aarakshan kii baat thik he, magar avasaron kaa laabh aage badhkar uthaanaa hoga
 Women do not want token participation
 survey main ye tathy saamne aeareses ke sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ne drushti adhyayan centre kii ore se taiyaar survey kii report jari kii
 He said that the survey of vision is very important, all the things were prepared by themselves for this survey
 isse judi bahanon dwaara kiya gaya kaary aapane aap main behad mahatvapurn he
 He said that men cannot decide the path of development of women
 survey main kai ahm baaten saamne ain
 People present at the event organized for the release of the survey report on women
 swasthyah40 fisad aspataal main ho chukin bharteesurve main saamne aayaa ki pachaas pratishat mahilaayein hi din main do baar bhojan karti hai
 There 3
 73 pratishat mahilaayein aaj bhi din main sirf ek baar khaanaa kha paati hai
 64 percent of girls under the age of 18 were exposed to menstrual problems
 duusare number par arthritis kii samasya ai
 It was shocking that 5
 28 pratishat mahilaayein blad pressure, 3
 07 percent women heart disease, 1
 62 pratishath diabetes or 0
 51 percent of women are battling cancer
 sabase ahm baat rahi ki survey main shaamil 40 pratishat mahilaon ne sweekaar kiya ki vah pichley do varsh main aspataal main bhartee ho chuki hai
 rss-inspired Vision Study Center did the biggest survey on women: Christian women were further linked to the employment of most tribal women, while the open category had the highest unemployment rate
 rojgaar se judi mahilaon ke bahumat kii shikaayat thi ki unhen bacchon ke liye cretch kii suvidha uplabdh nahin he, iske saath canteen, parivahan or kaarysthal par rest room kii suvidha bhi nahin milti, unamem se 60% se bhi adhik ko lone suvidha bhi praapt nahin he
 The study sample has seen the highest percentage of employment among women in the Christian community followed by women from Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Jain and Sikh communities
 shikshah shaadi or aarthik tangi ban rahi badhasrvey main paaya gaya ki shaadi or aarthik tangi ke kaaran ladakiyon ko bich main hi padhai chhodani padati he
 The survey revealed that reservation is proving helpful for SC and ST and OBC girls to pursue higher education
 survey main shaamil do tihaai mahilaayein apane ruchi ke vishyon ke bare main nahin bataa pai
 Which shows that due to all the restrictions and responsibilities of the house, they do not get a chance to think about their interest
 survey main shaamil ek chauthai mahilaon ne bataaya ki vah apane liye fursat ke pal nahin nikaal paatin
 Spiritual women became happier in the survey also found that women associated with spiritual fields are happier than women of other fields
 vahiin liv in main rahane vaaleen mahilaon kii tulana main shaadi kar ghar basaane vaaleen mahilaayein zyada khush hai
 The survey also revealed the special fact that 90 percent of the women, who do not have family and income, were found happier, except those who have earned at least ten thousand rupees a month
 survey main kaha gaya he ki isse pataa chalata he ki paise kaa khushiyon se koi naata nahin he
 Anjali Deshpande, Secretary of the Center for Vision Studies, is helpful for government schemes, said that the first such large survey on women of the country would definitely help in formulating policies for voluntary organizations along with the central and state governments
 kyonki, is survey ke jariye desh kii shiksha, swasthya, rojgaar or suraksha aadi se jude muddon par mahilaon se jude aadhikarik or pramanik aankade saamne aae hai
 It has been prepared in 26 volumes under the leadership of Project Director Manisha Kotekar

 Siddharth, who has tried his hand in romantic comedy and action films for the last several years, has not given any solo film in the last seven years
 unki jentalman, baar baar dekho, jabariyaa jodi jaisi kai filmein flop rahi hai
 This is probably why they are trying to adopt the tried and tested formula of Bollywood
