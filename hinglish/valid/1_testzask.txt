 Still, the question remains in Parker's mind that why Hachi does not behave like other dogs

 Gupta is a secret practice of Christianity or Christianity
 isamen isaai jis desh me rahete hai vahaan ve dikhaave ke taur par to us desh ke ishwar kii puja karte hai, vahaan kaa dharm maanate hai par vastav main andar se ve isai hote hai or nirantar isai dharm kaa prachaar karte rahete hai
 This practice was adopted when rulers of other religions or society posed a threat to Christianity
 jab krypto chrishchiyan 1 pratishat se kam hote he tab vah us desh ke ishwar ko apana kar apana kaam karte rahete hai
 When they become more numerous, they manifest Christianity
 hollywood film 'agora' main gupt isiyat ko dikhaaya gaya he
 In Greek, the word crypto means hidden or secret
 krypto chrishchiyan * kaa arth hua gupt-isai
 The important thing in this is that crypto-christians are not abusive or negative words
 krypto-chrischiyanity isai dharm kii ek sansthagat practice he
 Under the basic principle of crypto-christianity, in the country where Christians reside, they worship the God of that country, they believe that there is a religion which is their camouflage; But in fact they are Christians from inside and continue to preach Christianity
 krypto chrishchiyan kaa sabase pehla udhaaharan roman samajya main miltaa he jab isaiyat ne shruwati daur main rome main apane pair rakhe the
 Immediately the great Roman emperor Trajan considered Christianity a threat to Roman culture and proposed to all the Roman Christians who were either to abandon Christianity or suffer the death penalty
 roman isaiyon ne mrityu-dand se bachane ke liye isai dharm chhodane kaa naatak kiya or uske baad upar se ve roman devi devataaon kii puja karte rahe, par andar se isaiyat ko maanate the
 The way Muslims are 5–10 percent, they celebrate the law of that country
 par jab 20-30 pratishat hoten hai tab sharia kii maang shuru hoti he, dange hoten he
 Ethnic Cleansing of non-muslims begins as the population increases further
 par, krypto chrishchiyan, musalamaanon jaisi hinsa nahin karte
 When crypto Christians are less than 1 percent, then they continue to do their work by adopting the God of that country and as they become more numerous, they start insulting those deities
 Hollywood kii mashhoor film Agora** har hindu ko dekhni chahie
 It shows that when crypto Christians outnumbered Rome, they began insulting Roman deities
 vartmaan main bharat me bhi krypto chrishchiyan ne pakad banani shuru kii to yahan bhi hindu devi-devataaon, brahmanon ko gaali dene kaa kaam shuru kar diya
 Meaning, the work that took place 2000 years ago in Europe is happening in India today
 haal main professor kedaar mandal dwaara devi durga ko veshya kaha jo ki duusari sadi ke rome kii yaad dilaataa he
 There are many examples of crypto-christians, but the most interesting example is from Japan
 mishaniriyon kaa tathakthith-sant xavier jo bharat aayaa tha vah 1550 main dharmantaran ke liye japan gaya or usne kai baudhon ko isai banaaya
 In 1643, the Japanese nationalist King Shogun saw the promotion of Christianity as a threat to Japan's social unity
 shogun ne bal kaa prayog kiya or kai charcho ko todaa gaya
 The idols of jesus-mary were seized and broken
 bibal samet isai dharm kii kai kitaaben khuleam jalaayin gayi
 All the Japanese who converted to Christianity were persecuted
 unki balpurvak buddha dharm me ghar vaapasi karai gai
 Those who refused were beheaded
 kai isaiyon ne buddha dharm me ghar vaapasi kaa naatak kiya or krypto-chrishchiyan bane rahe
 In Japan these crypto-christians were called "kakure-christian ***"
 kakure-chrishchiyan ne baudhon ke dar se isai dharm se sambadhit koi bhi kitaab rakhni band kar di
 They prayed to worship Jesus and Mary, which sounded Buddhist mantras, but contained the words of the Bible
 ye isai prarthanaayen kakure-chrischiyanon ne ek peedi se duusari peedi maukhik rup se hastantarit kerani shuru kar di
 From 1550 to the next 400 years, kakure-christian lived under the pseudo-philosophy of Buddhism
 20veen shatabdi main jab japan audyogikeekaran kii taraf badha or baudhon ke dharmik kattarwad main kami ai to in kakure-chrishchiyan buddha dharm ke mukhute se baahar nikal apni isai pahchaan ujagar kii
 The crypto-christian Buddha-like statue, actually of Mother Mary, was venerated by Japan's crypto-christians
 keval roman samrajya or japan main hi krypto chrischiyanon ke udhaaharan nahin milte balki balkans va asia miner, madhyapurv, soviet rashia, china, naji germany samet bharat main bhi krypto chrischiyanon kii bahutayat he
 Just as Japan's crypto is called Christian Kakure, the countries of Asia Minor are called Drovartso in Serbia, Patsloi in Cyprus, Laramanoi in Albania, Crypto Maronite in Lebanon and Crypto Copts in Egypt
 bharat me aise bahut se kakure-chrishchiyan hai jo secularvaad, vampanth or buddha dharm kaa mukhauta pahan kar hamaare bich hai
 The Christian population in India is officially 2 crore and it would not be surprising if 100 million Christians come out of India
 akele punjab main anumaanit isai aabaadi 10 pratishat se upar he
 Many Christians in Punjab are under the cover of Sikhism, wear a turban, wear a beard, saber, a kadha but wear Sikhism but all of them are secret Christians
 bahut se krypto-chrishchiyan aarakshan lene ke liye hindu naam rakhe hai
 Many of these names are on Gods like Ram, Krishna, Shiva, Durga etc
 jinhen sangh ke log bhi sapane main gaiyr-hindu nahin samaj sakate jaise ki purv raashtrapati ke aar narayanan
 Who became a Dalit and rubbed all his life and when he saw the process of burial according to Christianity on his death, it was understood that it is crypto-christian
 desh me aise bahut se krypto-chrishchiyan hai jo hindu naamon main hindu dharm par hamalaa karke sirf vatican kaa agenda badha rahen hai
 We see crypto-christians every day in everyday life but do not understand them because they are hidden in the camouflage of Hindu names
 jaise ki– Naxalites with Hindu names who killed Swami Lakshmanananda are crypto Christians
 jis rajya ne sabase adhik hindi gayak die us rajya bengal main hindi kaa virodh karne vaale krypto chrishchiyan hai
 The earliest example of Gupta Christianity is found in the Roman Empire when Christianity set its feet in Rome in the early days 
 tatkaal mahaan romi samraat trojan ne isaiyat ko roman samskruti ke liye khatra samajha or jitne romi isai bane the unke saamne prastaav rakhaa ki yaa to ve isaiyat choden yaa mrityu-dand bhugten
 Roman Christians pretended to leave Christianity to avoid capital punishment

 vaayu main mila jalawaashp sheethal padaarthon ke sampark main aane se sanghanan ke kaaran osank tak pahunchataa he
 When the temperature of the air falls below the dew point, then the water vapor starts falling on the surface in the form of water droplets or hail
 isi ko varsha kehete hai
 At any place, the amount of water received from the rainbows and snowflakes at a given time is called the measurement of rainfall there
 garmi ke kaaran utpann jalawaashp upar akaash main jaakar failata he evam thanda hota he
 Therefore, as the air rises, its ability to hold water vapor decreases
 yahan tak ki adhik upar uthne se vaayu kaa taap us ank tak pahunch jaataa he, jahaan vaayu jalawaashp dhaaran kar sakati he
 At even lower temperatures, the water vapor gets converted into watercourses
 isi se badalon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Then clouds rain down on the surface due to water
 jalakan banane ke uparaant bhi yadi vaayu kaa taap kam hote hote himank se bhi kam ho jaataa he, to jalakan himakanon kaa rup dhaaran kar lete hai jisase himavarsha hoti he

 The air cools up and spreads
 vaashp kii maatra adhik hone se osank tak pahunchane ke liye taap ko kam girnaa padataa he
 Hence, the vapor quickly takes the form of water and there is pouring rain usually after two o'clock every day
 is varsha ko sanvahneey varsha kehete hai
 When winds are blocked in the path of steam-laden winds, these winds have to rise, due to the effect of frozen snow on the mountains and as the air is cooled by the spread of air, the air vapor comes in the form of droplets on the ground
 ye hawaayen parvat ke duusari ore maidan main utarate hi garam ho jaati hai or aasapaas ke vaataavaran ko bhi garam kar detii he
 Similar rainfall occurs in most parts of the world

 Therefore, the air rising up becomes cold and starts raining

 An instrument is used to measure how much rainfall has occurred in a place, which is called a rainbow
