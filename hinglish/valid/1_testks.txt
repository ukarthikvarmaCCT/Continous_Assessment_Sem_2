 Karan and Priya are the main pair of a dance troupe, and are in love with each other
 ek baar ve raaj naamak ek samrudh vyavsaayee ke krooj jahaaj par pradarshan karte hai
 Raj, who does not know that Priya and Karan are in love, is attracted to Priya on first sight
 kuch dinon baad vah priya ke saamne vivaah kaa prastaav rakhata he, jise vah sweekaar kar leti he
 When Karan comes to know this, he plans to cheat Raj with the help of Priya and grab all his money
 yojananusaar vivaah ke kuch varsh baad priya raaj ko talaak de degi, or isse mili nirvaah nidhi se karan or priya sukhpurvak ek saath shesh jivan vyateet karenge
 Raj introduces Priya to her family, after which both get married
 kuch dinon baad priya ek durghatana main ghayal ho jaati he, or raaj uski din-raat dekhbhaal karata he
 This incident causes Priya to change her heart, and she refuses to help Karan in betraying Raj
 karan turant yojana badalata he, or raaj ko ek anaam phone kar uske or priya ke sambandhon ke bare main bataa detaa he
 Raj is stunned to hear this, and comes in a rage and meets Karan, and gives him a supari to kill Priya
 duusari taraf, priya raaj ko sari sachai bataane kaa nishchay karti he, or ek casette main sab record kar use raaj kii gaadi main rakh detii he

 Galta Ji Lake surveykshan ke aadharbhoot siddhant bade hi saral hai
 On the surface of the earth, two points can be easily selected which can be seen from each other's position and the distance between them can be measured
 inhen kisi bhi vaanchit paimaane par kaagaj par aise lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unke nikatavarti kshetra kaa surveykshan kaagaj par samaa sake
 After this, by measuring the distance of any third point from these two points, you can mark its relative position on the paper with the same scale
 is prakaar ankit kinhin bhi do binduon se kisi tisare agyaat bindu kii duuri nikaalkar tathaa krmanugat ankit karke, puure kshetra kaa maanchitr banaaya ja saktaa he
 In other words, the method of surveying is the creation of triangles
 upar to tribhuj kii ek hi rachana kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, jisamen tribhuj kii teenon bhujaaon kii lambaaiyaan gyaat he
 Other composition methods of the triangle are also used in the survey
 surveykshan ke liye do bindu gyaat hona atyant aavashyak he, jisase tisare bindu kii saapeksh sthiti kaa pataa laganaa sambhav ho sake
 It is also clear from this that if the relative positions of the points in such a survey are correct, their directions cannot be known
 jo ho bhi saktaa he vah keval chumbakeey qutubanuma kii yatharthata tak hi simit rahegaa
 This would make it difficult that if any two or more sites in a wide area, independently of two or two points, are to be surveyed, then they will not necessarily match exactly on the common line
 kyonki aise surveykshanon ke praarambhik aadhaaron ke aalekhon kii ekasmaan dishaaen rakhane kii koi nishchit suvidha or siddhant nahin he
 To overcome this uncertainty, systematically and systematically select the key points in the entire wide area for the survey and consider them as a pivot
 phir mulbindu ke kramash: anya binduon kii dooriyaan or uttar disha se kone gyaat kar letaa he or in avyavon se surveykshak un binduon ke nirdeshaank nikaal letaa he
 For the success of the survey operation, it is necessary for the surveyor to solve the following three problems: pehali samasya kaa hal surveykshak ne chumbak kii sooyee ke gun kaa, jo sarvatra vidit hai, laabh uthaakar or theodolite kaa avishkaar karke kar liya
 The second problem was solved with the use of various types of equipment like lace, jariab, etc
, which are known to the general public
 samtal yaa lagbhag chauras bhoomi ke pradeshon main in do samasyaon ke samaadhaan se ek surveykshan vidhi ko janm mila, jisase chune hue binduon ke nirdeshaank nikaale ja sakate hai
 This method is called theodolite transition, or simply traversal
 magar jahaan bhoomi tuuti phooti yaa unchi nichi ho, jisapar chune gaye krmanugat binduon ke bich kii sidhi duuri feete yaa jareeb se na naapi ja sake, to chakraman kii vidhi safal nahin hogi
 In such a situation the surveyor adopts the method of triangulation
 is vidhi kii yah visheshta he ki surveykshak ganitiya sutron ke prayog se binduon ke bich kii duuri nikaal saktaa he
 Therefore, the surveyor selects the major points visible over a long distance in the high mountain range in such a way that they become the apex points of the well formed lattice of triangles
 aisi tribhujamala main gathe prayek tribhuj ke teenon kone theodolite se naap liye jate hai
 Among them, a triangle is made such that one arm is measured accurately on the ground
 us bhujaa kaa ek sire ke bindu par digansh bhi gyaat kar liya jaataa he
 Then the lengths of all the sides of the other triangles can be deduced from the appropriate trigonometric formula
 Similarly, all triangles are solved in chronological order, then with the coordinates of a or a being known, the distances of the forward points and the coordinates from the azimuth are removed
 
 is prakaar kaa tribhujan sampurna pradesh par bich jaataa he
 The length of the arms ranges from 10 to 50 miles and the coordinates are calculated taking into account the curvature of the Earth
 is prakaar kaa surveykshan bhuganit surveykshan ke antargat aata he
 After this, the control points established from the geometric survey are used to carry out a survey of small areas of such a state
 yadi bhuganitiya surveykshan se praapt niyantran bindu patt surveykshan ke liye paryaapt nahin hote hai, to surveykshak sthaneey aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye bhuganitiya niyantran binduon par aadhaarit ek chota sa tribhujan kar letaa he, jisase paryaapt niyantran bindu mil jate hai
 Finding such points, the surveyor draws his article on a square paper
 is prakaar niamakon kii sahaayta se saare bindu apni sahi saapeksh sthitiyon main baith jate hai
 By measuring the directions and distances of other points shown on the map from these points, the surveyor shows them on the map
 is vivaran se yah ek sahi dharna banegi ki is prakaar ke surveykshan main, to bahut samay nasht hoga
 To overcome this weakness, the surveyor adopts a process of palpitation
 patalchitran main vargankit patr par niyantrabinduon ke bane aalekh ko surveykshak lakdi ke ek samtal patal par sthir rup se baitha letaa he
 Such a latch is tightened by a screw on a tripod so that the lamina can be rotated to the position of the screw when needed and tightened to the desired position
 aise patal ke saath ek or upkaran prayukt hota he, jise dansharekhni kehete hai
 60 or 75 centimeters long, one centimeter thick and five centimeters wide, are made of metal or wooden bar
 lambey donon kinare ekadam sidhe or ek ore ko dhaalu hote hai, jisase sidhi or sahi rekha khinchon ja sake
 Drawing edges remain on the paper
 uuparavaale tal par do drishy vedhikaaye udhrvavarti khadi rahati hai
 The surveyor places the grafted plate at the physical position of one of the points on the article
 taduparant darsharekhni ko ek kinare uparyukt bindu or usase drushtigochar kisi duusare ankit bindu par sparsharekhiy rakhata he
 Then he stabilizes the panel by moving it through the visual observables without moving the view, so that the physical line joining the two tangent points is parallel to the line joining their positions on the plane
 is dasha main patal par, kinhin bhi do ankit binduon ko vargakit kaagaj par jodanevaali rekha sangati bhaumik rekha ke samaantar hogi
 In other words, the table graph stabilized in the right directions
 iske baad surveykshak aalekh par bani apni sthiti se, maanchitr par darshane janevaale anya binduon ko drishyvedhika se dekhakar, kramik rup se disharekhaayen khinch detaa he
 Thereafter, standing on a different physical position known on the article, fixes the board in the correct directions as before
 is prakriya ko patal kaa diksthaapan kehete hai
 Again, the directions of the same points, called rays, are drawn
 ye kirane apni pehali sangati kirnon par chhedan bindu dekar, aalekh par un binduon kii sahi saapeksh sthitiyaan sthapit kar detii hai
 Similarly, the survey of the entire area is conducted
 surveykshak binduon ko praapt kar, unase prithvi kii sataha par sthit prakritik or kritrim vastuon ko sanket chihron dwaara aalekh par bana detaa he
 This action is called paleography
 patalchitran se praapt maanchitr kii mudran dwaara kai pratiyaan banaai ja sakati hai
 The surveyor works on a single article for several months, so that the entire area can be drawn up for survey
 isse patalchitr kuch ganda or bhadda ho jaataa he
 In order to obtain a clean and beautiful map, the surveyor copies his palette, in blue, from the required map, on a scintillating scale
 usapar pun: vastuon kaa saaf or sundar aarekhan karata he or photography se ghataakar sahi paimaane kaa maanchitr praapt karata he
 The Great War of 1914 has given rise to a new method of survey
 is vidhi ke antargat vayuyan se surveykshan hetu kshetra ke shrunkhalabaddh photo le liye jate hai
 The camera's axis remains vertical while taking photos
 is kaaran ham prakaar liye photo urdhwadhar photograph kehalaate hai
 When taking photographs, it is taken care that each successive photograph has a common ऽ 60 का portion of the rear photograph adjacent to them and about 25 ऽ in adjacent right and left photographs
 chithran ke samay prithvi kii sataha se shankvakar prakaash kii kirane camera ke lens se hokar photo plate par padati hai, jisase pratibimb banate hai
 It will be clear from considering that samtal sataha se upar uthe, yaa neeche dhanse, bindu, maanchitr par bananevaali sahi udhrvadhar prakshep sthitiyon se hate hue chitrit hote hai, The greater the height or depth of the points, the greater will be their removal, yah hataav photo ke centrebindu se areey yaa anutrijya hota he
 So any two points on the surface of the earth at the physical position of the center of the photo will be equal to the angle of consistency of the photo, prayek photo par aage or peeche ke photo ke 60 bhaag ke ativyapan se unke kendriya bindu bhi bichwaale photo par chitrit honge
 These central points are called principal points or main base points and the line connecting them on the photo is called base
 photo par in jyamitiya sambandhon kaa laabh uthaakar, surveykshak unase maanchitr banane main safal hota he
 He first identifies and marks the control points located in that area on the photo
 phir photo se niyantrabindu or pradhan binduon ke saath saath ek aisa aalekh patr taiyaar karata jisamen sabhi bindu vaanchhit paimaane par apni sahi saapeksh sthitiyon main baithe hote hai
 He makes such a paper on transparent paper
 phir vah prayek photo ko kramash: aalekh par ankit uske pradhan bindu ke neeche is prakaar rakhata he ki aalekh par bane sannikat aadhaar, photo par bane sangeet aadhaaron par, sampati hon
 When this type of disturbance occurs, the surveyor draws the rays from the principal point, as shown in the map, as seen in that particular photo
 yahi kriya sabhi aage or peeche ke photo par hone se, sa-bindugami kirnon ke chhedan par, binduon ke sahi saapeksh sthitiyaan praapt ho jaati hai jinaki sahaayta se patalchitran kii bhanti maanchitr taiyaar ho jaataa he
 This action is called aerial survey
 yadi hawaii photograph, camera ke aksh ko urdhwadhar disha se jhukaa hua rakhkar, liye jaaen, to bhi surveykshak unase maanchitr taiyaar kar saktaa he
 Pictures taken in this way are called oblique photographs

 Blast furnaces are considered to be different from bloomery in that the purpose of a blast furnace is to produce molten metal that can be extracted from the furnace through the tap, while the purpose of blumery is to keep it from melting so that the carbon does not dissolve in the iron

 Competition of the industry results in excessive production
 sabase badi blast bhattiyon kaa aaytan lagbhag 5580 ghan me hota he or louh utpaadan kshamta lagbhag 88,000 ton prati saptaah hoti he
 This is a major increase in eighteenth-century typical furnaces with an average iron production capacity of about 360 tons per year
 blast bhattiyon ke bhinn roopon jaise swedish electric blast fernes, ko un deshon main viksit kiya gaya he jahaan koi swadeshi koyala sansaadhan nahin he
 Modern furnaces are equipped with an array of auxiliary facilities such as ore storage yard where the barges are evacuated to increase efficiency
 kachche maal ko ayask pulon yaa rail hoparon or ayask sthanantaran kaaron kii sahaayta se stochouse complex main sthanantarit kiya jaataa he
 Rail-mounted scale cars or computer-controlled wet hoppers measure various raw materials to produce the desired hot metal and sintered chemical
 kachche maal ko ghiraniyon yaa vaahak belton dwaara chaalit ek skip car ke madhyam se blast fernes ke upar le jaaya jaataa he
 a variety of methods are used to charge raw materials in blast furnaces
 kuch blast ferneson main ek "dabl bel" pranali kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jahaan blast fernes main kachche maal ke pravesh ko niyantrit karne ke liye do "belon" kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The purpose of these two bales is to reduce the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace
 sabase pehle kachche maal ko upree yaa choti ghanti main khaali kiya jaataa he
 The bell is then rotated to a predetermined magnitude to more accurately distribute the charge
 uske baad bade bel main charge ko khaali karne ke liye choti bel ko kholaa jaataa he
 The smaller bell is then closed to close the blast furnace while the larger bell distributes the charge to the blast furnace
 ek adhik haal kii dizin main "bel rahit" pranali kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In these systems multiple hoppers are used for each raw material which is then released through the valve into the blast furnace
 milaae jane vaale prayek ghatak ke pariman ko niyantrit karne main skip yaa vaahak system kii tulana main ye valve adhik sahi sabit hote hai jisase fernes kii kaarykushalta bad jaati he
 In some of these bellless systems, shoots are also used to precisely control the location of the charge
 loha banane vaali blast bhatti khud durdamy eenton vaali ek lambii chimney jaisi sanrachana ke rup main bani hoti he
 Coke, limestone flux and iron ore are charged in the upper part of the furnace in a precise fill order which helps to control the gas flow and chemical reaction within the furnace

 Modern and large blast furnaces may have a maximum of four tapholes and two casthouses
 nal ke madhyam se kachche lohe or dhaatumal ke nikalne ke baad nalchhidr ko phir se durdamy mitti se band kar diya jaataa he
 Toure is used to implement hot blast which is used to increase the efficiency of the blast furnace
 garm blast ko aadhaar ke paas tour ke naam pani se thanda kiye jane vaale tambe kii tontiyon ke madhyam se bhatti main le jaaya jaataa he
 The hot blast temperature can range from 900 ° c to 1300 ° C, depending on the design and condition of the stove
 unke taapmaana sahane kii kshamta 2000 degree celsius se 2300 degree celsius tak ho sakati he
 Oil, alkatara, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can be added to the furnace at the tier level to release the additional energy required to increase productivity
 pighale hue lohe kaa utpaadan karne vaali mukhya rasinic pratikriya is prakaar he: This reaction can be divided into multiple phases of which the preheated blast air flowing into the furnace as the first phase reacts with carbon in the form of coke resulting in the production of carbon mono oxide and heat: garm carbon mono oxide louh ayask ko kam karne vaala kaarak he or yah aayran oxide ke saath pratikriya karke pighale hue lohe or carbon daai oxide kaa nirmaan karata he
 Iron is converted into several phases depending on the temperature of different parts of the furnace
 bhatti ke sabase upree bhaag main jahaan taapmaana aam taur par 200 degree celsius or 700 degree celsius ke bich hota he, aayran oxide ko aayran aayran oxide, fe3o4 main badal diya jaataa he
 At a temperature of about 850 ° C, the iron is converted to iron oxide in a bit more like below: taji bhojya saamagree ke rup main bhatti se hokar guzarane vaali hawa main maujuud nitrogen, garm carbon dioxide or apratikriya vaali carbon monooxide pratikriya kshetra main pravesh karti he
 When these gases move downstream, the unfavorable-current gases heat the feed charge as well as convert limestone into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide: jab aayran oxide 1200 degree celsius tak ke ucchtar taapmaana vaale kshetra main pravesh karti he to yah aage chalakar louh dhaatu main parinat ho jaataa he: The carbon dioxide produced in this process converts to carbon mono oxide again with the help of coke
 bhatti ke gasiy vaataavaran ko niyantrit karne vaali mukhya pratikriya ko baudward pratikriya kaha jaataa he: The process of limestone decomposition in the central areas of the furnace proceeds according to the following reaction: apghaton dwaara nirmit calcium oxide lohe main maujuud vibhinn amleey ashuddhiyon ke saath pratikriya karke ek faiyalitic dhaatumal kaa nirmaan karti he jo anivaary rup se calcium silicket, casio3 he: The "pig iron" manufactured by the blast furnace has a relatively high carbon content of about 4 to 5 percent, making it very brittle and used for limited and immediate commercial purposes
 kuch pig aayran kaa istemaal cast aayran banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Most pig iron manufactured by blast furnaces undergo an additional process to reduce carbon content and to manufacture various level steel used for tools and construction materials
 haalanki blast bhattiyon kii kaarykushalta main lagaataar vikaas ho rahaa he lekin phir bhi blast bhatti ke andar hone vaali rasinic prakriya main koi badlaav nahin hua he
 According to the American Iron and Steel Institute: "blast furnaces will exist for millennia because large and efficient furnaces can manufacture hot metal at a lower cost than other iron manufacturing technologies
 " blast bhattiyon kii sabase badi khaamiyon main se ek khami yah he ki inamen anivaary rup se carbon daai oxide kaa nirmaan hota he kyonki carbon dwaara aayran oxide ko parivartit karke loha praapt kiya jaataa he or iskaa koi kifayati vikalp nahin he - ispaat nirmaan duniya main carbon daai oxide utsarjan ke aprihaary audyogic yogadanakartaaon main se ek he 
 The challenge established by the blast furnace's greenhouse gas emissions is being addressed at ULCOS, an ongoing European program
 kam se kam 50% tak vishisht utsarjan main katautee karne ke liye kai nae prakriya margon kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya he or unki baariki se jaanch kii gai he
 Some insist on storing CO2 after it is acquired while others suggest decontamination of iron and steel production through hydrogen, electricity and biomass

 Kohli has authored his writings in all the major genres of literature and minor genres and critical literature
 unhone shatadhik shreshth granthon kaa srijan kiya he
 The credit for introducing the genre of 'epic novel' in Hindi literature goes to Narendra Kohli
 puranic evam aitihaasik charitron kii gutthiyon ko sulajhaate hue unke madhyam se aadhunik saamaaj kii samasyaon evam unke samaadhaan ko samaaj ke samaksh prastut karnaa kohli kii anyatam visheshta he
 Kohliji is a cultural nationalist litterateur who through his compositions has introduced the Indian way of life and philosophy
 janvari, 2017 main unhen padmashri se sammanit kiya gaya
 Narendra Kohli was born on 6 January 1940 in Sialkot city of United Punjab, now in Pakistan
 praarambhik shiksha lahore me armbh hui or bharat vibhaajan ke pashchaat parivaar ke jamshedpur chale aane par vahiin aage badi
 It is interesting that in the initial stage, the medium of education of this all-time best creator of Hindi was Urdu and not Hindi
 hindi vishay unhen dasvin kaksha kii pariksha ke baad hi mil paaya
 As a student Narendra was very meritorious and passed with good marks
 In debating competitions, he also got first place in many competitions
 baad me dilli vishvavidhyalay se snatakottar or doctorat kii oopaadhi bhi lee
 His dissertation on the subject "hindi Novels: Creation and Theory" was completed under the direction of the famous critic Dr
 Nagendra
 is praarambhik kaary main hi yuva narendra kohli kii marmbhedak drushti evam mul tatv ko pakad lene kii shakti kaa pataa lag jaataa he
 From 1963 to 1995, he worked at the University of Delhi and from there he took voluntary leave in 1995 to get full-time freedom of writing
 praayah chah-saat dashakon ke pashchaat acharya hajariprasad dvivedi ke saahitiyik avdaan kaa moolyankan karte samay ab ek pramukh tathy usamen or joda ja saktaa he
 Acharya Dwivedi opened a door in Hindi literature through which Narendra Kohli made a reputation for an entire era
 This is the brightest page in the history of Hindi literature and it is Shri Acharya Dwivedi who is the chief Vaitalik of this new prabhat who influenced young Narendra Kohli
 paramparaagat vichaardhaara evam charitrachitran se prabhavit hue bagaiyr spasht evam suchintit tark ke aagrah par moulik drusht se soch sakna saahitiyik tathyon, visheshat: aitihaasik-puranic tathyon kaa moulik vaigyanik vishleshan yah vah visheshta he jisaki neenv acharya dvivedi ne daali thi or usapar ramakatha, mahabharat katha evam krishna-kathaon aadi ke bhavy prasaad khadey karne kaa shrey acharya narendra kohli kaa he
 In short, the original tone of Indian culture resonated in the literature of Acharya Dwivedi and her resonance was transformed into a panchjanya of Narendra Kohli and transformed into a Krishnodhosh of culture that shook Hindi literature
 aadhunik yug main narendra kohli ne sahitya main aasthaavadi mulyon ko swar diya tha
 In 1975, with the publication of his Ram Katha novel 'deeksha', the 'era of cultural renaissance' started in Hindi literature, the proposal to name 'narendra Kohli era' in Hindi literature is also gaining momentum
 taatkaalik andhkaar, niraashaa, bhrashtachar evam moolyaheenata ke yug main narendra kohli ne aisa kaaljayi paatr chunaa jo bhartiya manisha ke rome-rome main spandit tha
 The era of the epic had passed, the conductor of the 'katha' element of literature was no longer a poem, but a prose
 atyaadhik rudh ho chuki ramakatha ko yuva kohli ne apni kaaljayi pratibha ke bal par jis prakaar upanyaas ke rup main avatarit kiya, vah to ab hindi sahitya ke itihaas kaa ek svarnim prishth ban chukaa he
 By removing the darkness of ages, he removed the story of Lord Rama from the sentimental sentiments of the devotees and put him on the ground of modern reality
 Not only the literary and the readership class was overwhelmed
 kis prakaar ek upekshit or nirvasit rajkumaar apane aatmbal se shoshit, peedit evam trast janata main nae praan phunk detaa he, 'abhyuday' main yah dekhnaa kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin tha
 When the Ramakatha, which has become age-old, has changed in a new genre according to the interest and culture of the modern reader, it does not remain mindless to see that the author has maintained the dignity of Ramakatha and the life-values of Ramayana in it
 Have done aashcharya nahin ki tatkaaleen sabhi diggaj sahityakaron se yuva narendra kohli ko bharpoor aashirwad bhi mila or badai bhi
 murdhanya aalochak or sahityakar acharya hajariprasad dvivedi, amritlal nagar, yashpal, jainendrakumar ityadi praayah sabhi sheershasth rachanakaaron ne narendra kohli kii khule shabdon main khule dil se bharpoor taareef kari
 jainendra jaise us samay ke prasiddhtam rachanakaaron ne bhi yuva kohli ko padhaa or jin shabdon main apni pratikraya vyakt kii usne hindi sahitya main kisi vishisht pratibha ke aagaman kii spasht ghoshnaa kar di
 i do not know what to expect from a novel and what its craft is
 prathit hota he ki aapaki rachana upanyaas ke dharm se oonche uthakar kuch shaastra kii kaksha tak bad jaati he
 i am grateful to you for this and congratulate you heartily
 -jainendra Kumar maine aapmen vah pratibha dekhi he jo aapako hindi ke agrani sahityakaron main laa detii he
 You have presented some part of the original story of Ram Katha with great skill
 usamen aupnyasikta he, kahani kii pakad he
 Bhagavaticharan Verma, aapane ram katha, jise anek itihaaskaar maatr puranic aakhyaan yaa myth hi maanate hai, ko yathashakti yathartwaadee tarksangat vyakhya dene kaa praytn kiya he
 a good attempt to give the myth of Ahalya to give the impression of reality from imagination
 Yashpal ramakatha ko aapane ekadam nayi drushti se dekha he
 In 'opportunity', you have portrayed Ram's character from a new human point of view
 isamen sita kaa jo charitra aapane chitrit kiya he, vah bahut hi aakarshak he
 Sita was never portrayed as such a sharp-headed
 saath hi sumitra kaa charitra aapane bahut tejasvi nari ke rup main ukera he
 i am happy that without changing the original events of the Ramayana story as much as possible, you have given a fascinating interpretation of it
 


pustak aapke adhyayan, manan or chintan ko ujagar karti he
 - Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, diksha main praudh chintan ke aadhaar par ramakatha ko aadhunik sandarbh pradaan karne kaa saahasik praytn kiya gaya he
 The major events of Balakanda and the prudent re-narration of the characters of Rama and Vishwamitra, rational interpretation of Yugapurusha / Yugavatar form of Rama are special achievements of the novel
 dow nagendra Curiously, he turned a few pages of 'diksha' and then the book intrigued him that he spent the entire evening both days after reading it
 badhai
 chaar khandon main puri ramakatha ek bahut bada project he
 If you have kept this 'tempo' from the beginning to the end, it will be a huge task
 In this, the background stories of Sita and Ahalya's images have become very powerful
 dharmaveer bharti 27-2-76) i have read Dr
 Shantikumar Nanuram's dissertation on Valmiki Ramayana
 ramesh kuntal megh evam athavlekar ke ram ko bhi padhaa he; lekin jitna sookshm, gahan, chintanapurn viraat chithran aapane kiya vaisaa mujhe samooche hindi sahitya main aaj tak kahin dekhne ko nahin mila
 agar main raja yaa saadhan-sampann mantri hota to ramayana kii jagah isi pustak ko kharidkar ghar-ghar bantwataa"
 ramnarayan upaadhyaay You are strong and conscious in your portrayal of your hero
 


 the flow is good
 kai bimb achche ubhare, saath saath nibal bhi hai, par hota yah chalata he ki ek acchhee jhaanki jhalak jaati he or upanyaas phir se jor pakad jaataa he
 In this way, Ravani will be considered as the first
 Congratulations on this success
 


 sore body from the morning's labor, but full of contentment - with all my heart i thank you for doing a lot of work and proving Akshay Yash
 Amritlal Nagar pratham shrenee ke katipay upanyaaskaaron main ab ek naam or jud gaya-dridhtaapurvak main apana yah abhimath aapatak pahunchaana chahta hoon
 


ramakatha se sambandhit saare hi paatr nae-nae roopon main saamne aaye hai, unki janabhimukh bhoomika ek-ek pathak-pathika ke andar pakshadharatv ko ankurit karegi yah meraa bhavishya-kathan he
 Kavi Baba Nagarjuna ramakatha kii aisi uganuroop vyakhya pehle kabhi nahin padhi thi
 This gives Ram a very healthy vision to understand on the human plane and the reality of struggle emerges in place of blank sentiment
 

aapaki vyakhya main badi taazgi he
 The praise is that you have not allowed the traditional dignity of Ramkatha to be distorted
 


main to chaahunga ki aap ramayana or mahabharat ke anya puranic prasangon evam paatro kaa bhi udghaatan karen
 he to jokhim kaa kaam par yadi sadh gaya to aap hindi katha sahitya main sarvatha nayi vidha ke praneta honge
" -shivamangala singh 'suman' Dr
 Narendra Kohli has his own special place in Hindi literature
 vigat tees-pantis varshon main unhone jo likhaa he vah nayaa hone ke saath-saath mithkeey drushti se ek nai jameen todane jaisaa he
 


 Kohli has also shown his fundamental talent in the fields of satire, drama, review and story
 maanviya samvednaa kaa parkhi narendra kohli vartmaan yug kaa pratibhashali varisht sahityakar he
 "dr
 Vijayendra Graduate", vastutah narendra kohli ne apni ramakatha ko na to sampradayik drushti se dekha he na hi punarutthanavaadee drushti se
 maanavtaavaadi, vistaaravaadi ektantr kii nirankushta kaa virodh karne vaali yah drushti pragatisheel maanavtawaad kii samarthak he
 The dream of protecting humanity and establishing a just and equitable exploited society is neither communal nor revivalist in any sense
 - Dr
 Kavita Surabhi narendra kohli kaa avdaan maatraatmak pariman main bhi paryaapt adhik he
 His epic novel series comprising nineteen novels 'mahasamar', 'break, Kara Break', 'abhyudaya' are more than their predecessors both in terms of quality and quantity
 unke anya upanyaas bhi vibhinn virgon main shreshth kritiyon main gine ja sakate hai
 Social novels include 'suffering with Sorrow', 'pardoning GG', 'preity-katha'; 'atmaadan', based on the life of Rajyavardhan and Harshvardhan in historical novels; 'abhigyan', based on the life of krishna-sudama in philosophical novels; In mythological-modernist novels, 'vasudev' places him in a higher position than all the predecessors and contemporary writers of Hindi
 iske atirikt vrihad vyang sahitya, naatak or kahaniyon ke saath saath narendra kohli ne gambhir evam utkrisht niabandh, yatra vivaran evam maarmik aalochanaayen bhi likhi hai
 In short, his contribution can be seen in every genre of prose, and he is often superior to all other writers in his particular genre
 unke krititv kaa aadha bhi kisi anya sahityakar ko yug-pravartak sahityakar ghoshit karne ke liye paryaapt he
 Narendra Kohli has made those stories his medium which are world famous for their expansion and diversity: Ram Katha and Mahabharata Katha
 'yannabhaarte - tannabhaarte' ko charitaarth karte hue unke mahopanyas 'mahasamar' maatr main varnit paatro, ghatnaon, manobhaavon aadi kii sankhya evam vaividhya dekhen to vah bhi paryaapt tehregaa
 varnan kala, charitra-chithran, manojgat kaa varnan ityadi dekhen bhi kohli premchand se na sirf aage nikal jate he, varan samvedansheeltaa evam gaharaai bhi unamem adhik he
 The feature of Narendra Kohli that makes him distinct from these two predecessors is the best practice of nineteen classic works continuously for thirty-five years after each
 iske atirikt vrihad vyang-sahitya, saamaajik upanyaas, aitihaasik upanyaas, manovaigyanik upanyaas bhi hai; safal naatak hai, vaicharik niabandh, aalochanatmak niabandh, samikshatmak evam vishleshnatmak prabandh, abhibhaashan, lekh, sansmaran, rekhachitron kaa aisa khazaana he
 

 He has given Hindi literature so much in every genre of prose that all his contributions seem to be insignificant
 upanyaas, kahani, vyang, naatak, niabandh, aalochana, sansmaran ityadi gadhy kii sabhi pramukh evam gaun vidhaon main narendra kohli ne apni vidagdhta kaa parichay diya he
 The reason for the wonderful hold on the novel mode is that Narendra Kohli's extensive expertise in many subjects, he understands human psychology deeply and by capturing the basic elements of different characters, he can effectively and reliably respond to his innate response in different situations
 Can present
 ausat evam asaadhaaran, sabhi prakaar ke paatro ko ve apni sahaj samvednaa evam bhedak vishleshak shakti se na sirf pakad lete he, varan unke saath tadatmya sthapit kar lete hai
 a comprehensive depiction of political equations, counter-attacks, balance of power, etc
 is found in his compositions
 bhashaa, style, shilp evam kathanak ke str par narendra kohli ne anek nae evam safal prayog kiye hai
 He has invented a new genre of epic novels by elevating novels to the level of ancient epics
 narendra kohli kii siddhahastata kaa uttam udhaaharan he unke mahoupanyaas 'mahasamar' ke vistrut failaav se 'saath saha gaya dukh' tak kaa atisankshipt drishypatal
 saikadon paatro evam hajaaron ghatnaon se samrudh 'mahasamar' ke aath khandon ke chaar hazaar prishthon ke vistaar main kahin bhi na bikharaav he, na charitra kii visangatiyaan, na drushti or darshan kaa bhed
 pandraa varshon ke lambe samay main likhe gaye is mahakavyatmak upanyaas main lekhak kii vishleshnatmak drushti kitni spasht he, yah unke granth "jahaan he dharm, vahiin he jai" ko dekhakar samajha ja saktaa he jo mahabharat kii arthprakruti par aadhaarit he
 In this book, he has considered the characters and events mentioned in 'mahasamar', has put the problems in front and tried to find a solution to them
 mahabharat ko samajhane main prayasshil is mahoupanyaaskaar kaa yah udhyam dekhte hi banataa he jisamen unki vichaar-prakriya ke rekhankan main hi ek puraa granth taiyaar ho jaataa he
 For students and critics of literature, this book is not only important in understanding the literature-making-process of Narendra Kohli, but it is absolutely necessary
 is granth main narendra kohli ne vibhinn charitron ke bare main nayi evam spasht sthapanaayen di hai
 Without being impressed and terrorized by the image engraved in his public mind, logical analysis of events, Kohliji has analyzed the original character of Krishna, Yudhishthira, Kunti, Draupadi, Bhishma, Drona etc
, quite differently from the orthodox images
 duusare dhruv par unka doosraa upanyaas "saath saha gaya dukh" he jo maatr do paatro ko lekar buna gaya he
 Despite being an early novel written by him, it is a very strong and mature work of Hindi literature
 'saath saha gaya dukh' narendra kohli kii us saahitiyik shakti ko udghaatit karata he
 Telling 'sidhi Baat' directly and so clearly that it gets into the mind of the reader, make him laugh and cry
 Narendra Kohli is unique in this art
 'saath saha gaya dukh' narendra kohli ke samvedansheel paksh ko udghaatit karata he
 The utterance by Mahadevi for 'prasad' fits him perfectly: "


 it is proved that the strings of his life-style were so tight that even the lightest chimes would resonate in him
 " "I was surprised to see how a simple flat domestic or family novel of just two and a half characters has become so moving and engaging
 anlankrita jivan-bhashaa main saadagi kaa saundarya gholkar kis kala se ise itani saghan samvedniyata se purna banaaya gaya he
 " kohliji kaa pratham upanyaas tha 'punararambh'
 is vyaktiparak-saamaajik upanyaas main teen pidiyon ke varnan ke lakshya ko lekar chale upanyaaskaar ne unke madhyam se swatantraaa-prapti ke sankramanakalin samaaj ke vibhinn virgon ke logon kii maansikta evam jivan-sangharsh kii unki paristhitiyon ko chitrit karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Then came 'terror'
 It is a depiction of the depressed state of the rotting current society, its inability to fight atrocities, impotence of the ideology of the intellectuals and failure of the culmination of the karma of the higher ideology which fills the mind with depression
 narendra kohli kii ek badi uplabdhi he "vartmaan samasyaon ko kaal-pravaah ke manjhdhaar se nikaal kar maanav-samaaj kii shaashvat samasyaon ke rup main unpar sarthak chintan"
 upanyaas main darshan, aadhyatm evam niti kaa pathneey evam manograhi samavesh unhen samakaleen evam purvavarti sabhi sahityakaron se ucchtar dharaatal par khada kar detaa he
 Thus he started writing from the age of six, but his works started being published from the 1960s onwards
 samakaleen lekhakon se wo bhinn is prakaar hai ki unhone jaani maani kahaniyon ko bilkul moulik tareeke se likhaa
 Below is a list of his major mass novels based on historical stories
 unki rachnaaon kaa vibhinn bhartiya bhashaaon main anuwaad hua he
 In the works of Ramkatha series titled 'deeksha', 'opportunity', 'struggle Towards' and 'yudh', the story of the millennial tradition of godliness and devotion in the masses was broken by the narrator, the religion and the divine cultural land connected with it is
 ramakatha kii nai jameen ko nae maanviya, vishwasaneey, bhautik, saamaajik, raajnneetik or aadhunik rup main prastut kiya gaya he
 Narendra Kohli has often created more than a hundred high-quality texts
 sandarbh granth Magazines issue vaidic samay se hi vishnu sampoorn vishwa kii sarvocch shakti tathaa niyanta ke rup main maanya rahe hai
 Vishnu is one of the three main forms of God in the basic texts of Hinduism, according to the Puranic Purana
 puraanon main trimurti vishnu ko vishwa kaa paalanhaar kaha gaya he
 Brahma and Shiva are considered to be the other two forms of Trimurti
 brahma ko jahaan vishwa kaa srijan karne vaala mana jaataa he, vahiin shiv ko sanhaarak mana gaya he
 Originally Vishnu and Shiva and Brahma are also the same, this belief has also been generally accepted
 nyaay ko prashray, anyaay ke vinaash tathaa jeev ko paristhiti ke anusaar uchit maarg-grahan ke nirdesh hetu vibhinn roopon main avatar grahan karanevaale ke rup main vishnu maanya rahe hai
 According to the Puranas, Vishnu's wife is Lakshmi
 kaamdev vishnu ji kaa putr tha
 Vishnu's abode is Kshira Sagar
 unka shayan sheshnag ke upar he
 a lotus is produced from his navel in which Brahma ji is situated
 vah apane neeche vaale baayein haath main padam, apane neeche vaale daahine haath main gada ,upar vaale baayein haath main shankh or apane upar vaale daahine haath main chakra dhaaran karte hai
 The derivation of the word 'vishnu' has been considered mainly from the 'vishu' metal
 nirukt main yaskacharya ne mukhya rup se 'vish' dhaatu ko hi 'vyapti' ke arth main lete hue usase 'vishnu' shabd ko nishpann bataaya he
 Alternatively, 'vishwa Dhatu' is also taken to mean 'entry', 'because it is penetrated everywhere because of being an aspect
 aadi shankaracharya ne bhi apane vishnusahasranam-bhashya main 'vishnu' shabd kaa arth mukhyatah vyapak hi mana he, tathaa uski vyutpatti ke rup main spashtatah likhaa he ki "vyapti arth ke vaachak nuk pratyyant 'vish' dhaatu kaa rup 'vishnu' banataa he"
 He has also taken the 'vishwa Dhatu' option and wrote that "or the negative form of the 'vishva Dhatu' is Vishnu; as stated in Vishnupurana - 'the power of that Mahatma has entered this whole world
 ; Therefore he is called Vishnu, because ‘vish’ dhatu means to enter ”
 rugveda ke pramukh bhashyakaron ne bhi praayah ek swar se 'vishnu' shabd kaa arth vyapak hi kiya he
 In the interpretation of Vishnusukta, Acharya Saiyan means 'vishnu' is pervasive and omnipresent; So Shripad Damodar Satavalekar also takes its meaning related to the generality
 maharishi dayanand saraswati ne bhi 'vishnu' kaa arth anekatra sarvyaapee paramatma kiya he or kai jagah param vidvan ke arth main bhi liya he
 Thus it is clearly reflected that the word 'vishnu' is derived from 'vishu' metal and its meaning is vyapam
 vaidic dev-parampara main sookhton kii sankhyik drushti se vishnu kaa sthaan gaun he kyonki unka stvan maatr 5 sookhton main kiya gaya he; lekin yadi sankhyik drushti se na dekhakar unpar or pahaluon se vichaar kiya jaay to unka mahatva bahut badhkar saamne aata he
 In the Rigveda, he is read with adjectives like 'brihachhriar', Yuvakumar etc
 rugveda main ullikhit vishnu ke swaroop evam vaishishtyon kaa avlokan nimnanki binduon main kiya ja saktaa he :- The unique feature of Vishnu is his three foot-projections, which are mentioned twelve times in the Rigveda
 sambhavtah yah unki sabase badi visheshta he
 His three steps are said to be full of honey, which never diminishes
 unke teen pad-kram itane vistrut hai ki unamem sampoorn lok vidyaman rahete hai 
 'tredha Vichkramana' also transitions to three foot-projections
 ‘urugay’ or ‘urukram’ aadi pad bhi ukt tathy ke parichaayak hai
 Out of his three rankings supplied with Madhu, two are visible, the third is completely imperceptible
 is tisare sarvocch pad ko pakshiyon kii udaan or martya chakshu ke us paar kaha gaya he
 Yask's predecessor Shakupani considers these three footprints to be the symbols of the Sun's movement in three parts of the Universe - Earth, Space and Duloka
 yask ke hi purvavarti aurnavabh unhen surya ke udai, madhyakash main sthiti tathaa ast kaa vaachi maanate hai
 Tilak Sir considers them as a sign of trifurcation of the year
 yadi dekha jaay to adhikansh vidvan vishnu ko surya-vaachi maan kar udaykaal se madhyahn paryant uskaa ek padprakshep, madhyahn se astkaal paryant dwitiya padprakshep or astkaal se punah agrim udaykaal tak tritiy paad-prakshep sweekaarte hai
 These aforesaid two foot projections have been called visible and the third one is unmarked
 lekin mcdanal sahit anya anek vidwaanon kaa bhi kahana he ki is arth main tisare charan ko 'sarvocch' kaise mana ja saktaa he? isliye ve log purvokt shakpuni kii tarah teen charnon ko saura devtaa ke teenon lokon main se hokar jane ke maarg ko maanate hai
 Supporting the idea of the Sun, mcdanal mentions the operation of his 90 horse by Vishnu, each of which has four names
 is prakaar 4 kii sankhya se gunikrut 90 arthath 360 ashwon ko ve ek saura varsh ke dinon se abhinn maanate hai
 In fact, the two terms of Vishnu indicate the control of the whole world and his attainment of the third post i
e
 His ultimate abode
 swayan rugveda main hi in teen padon kii rahasyatmak vyakhya kii gayi he
 Therefore, considering this verse as knowledgeable, it has been clearly stated in the Rigveda that the ultimate post of Vishnu is known only by the learned people
 vaise to vishnu ko vaani main nivas karne vaala bhi mana jaataa he, kintu unka param priy awaas sthal 'pathah' rugveda main bahucharchit he
 Acharya Sayan considered the term 'giri' to be a courtesy, along with its meaning 'vani', as well as figuratively 'advanced folk like a mountain'
 'giri' ko yadi in donon arthon main sweekrut kar liya jaay to samasya kaa samaadhaan ho jaataa he
 Where Vishnu reaches the third position is his place of residence
 vishnu kaa lok ‘param pad’ he arthath gantavya roopen vah sarvotkrisht lok he
 The specialty of that 'param pad' is that it is highly illuminated
 vahaan anek shringon vaali gaayen sancharan kiya karti hai
 'gavah' is like a courtesy here
 shlesh se uskaa arth ‘gaayen’ karne par vahaan dugdh aadi bhautik pushti kaa prachurya evam ‘kirane’ karne par vahaan prakaash arthath atmik unnati kaa bahulya sahaj hi anumey he
 The 'param Pad' of Vishnu has a permanent emanation of Madhu
 yah ‘madhu’ devataaon ko bhi anandit karanevaala he
 Whatever meaning is given to this elegant verse, but it is a sign of bliss in every situation, for which all the creatures including the deity are also desirous and are also trying
 isliye ukt lok kii prapti kii kaamana sabhi karte hai
 In the same mantra, there are also mentions of virtuous people there, while experiencing fulfillment
 vishnu kii ek pramukh visheshta unka indra se maitribhav he
 Indra's companionship enforces his three footsteps
 indra ke saath milakar vah shambar daitya ke 99 kilon kaa vinaash karte hai
 In the same way, he also helps Indra in the battle with vrittra
 donon ko kahin-kahin ek duusare kii shaktiyon se yukt bhi batalaaya gaya he
 Thus Sompan by Vishnu and three foot projections by Indra are also described
 rugveda, mandal 6, sookt 69 main donon devon kaa yugmaroopen stvan hua he
 Similarly, in the verse 5, Sukta 87 of the Rigveda, he gets his help with Indra's fellow Marudagans
 vish dhaatu se vyutpann vishnu pad kaa shabdic arth ‘vyapak, gatisheel, kriyasheel athwa udhyam-sheel’ hota he
 They are praised by the people due to their force and disorder
 ve anant veeryavale hai
 Due to this quality, he is also considered as ‘vrishna’ symbolically
 apane veery athwa vir karmon ke kaaran ve shatruon ke bhay kaa kaaran hai
 People are afraid of them in the same way as a mountain lion
 ‘parameshwaradbhitih’ aadi shruti-vachanon se saamaanya janon kaa bhi unase bhay karnaa siddh ho jaataa he
 Being afraid of them is not without reason
 ve kutsiton kaa vadh aadi hinsakarm karne vaale hai
 It is important to note here that they kill the snotty violent person
 isliye unke liye kaha gaya he ki ve hatyare nahin hai
 Vishnu is wide-ranging, broad and of unrestrained speed
 ‘urugay’ or ‘urukram’ aadi pad is tathy ke poshak hai
 The meaning of 'uruguay' is not even glorified by Acharya Sayan by 'mahajajans doing Stuyaman' or 'prabhutya Stuyaman'
 da
yadunandan mishra kaa kahana he ki is pad kaa arth ‘visteern gati vaala’ karne ke liye ham is liye aagrahvan hai, kyonki use ‘sabhi lokon main sancharan karne vaala’ kaha gaya he
 Their rankings are so long that they measure the three worlds with their three footprints
 vishnu ke teen pad yadi sristi karte hai, sthaapan karte hai, dhaaran karte hai to vahiin par ashrith janon kaa paalan-poshan bhi kiya karte hai
 People receive their bhagya annadi as a prasad of the same three order, so that they experience ultimate fulfillment
 jo log vishnu kii stuti karte hai, unka ve sarvavidh kalyaan karte hai, kyonki unke stavnadi karm se use param sphurti milti he
 In this way, everyone is eager to reach the praise of Lord Vishnu
 ve varisht daata hai
 Trinity is also reflected in the qualities of Vishnu
 ve teen pad-kram vaale, teen prakaar kii gati karne vaale, teenon lokon ko naap lene vaale or lokatray ke dharak hai
 Similarly, he is also the equated form of 'tridhatu' ie satta, raja and tama or containing earth, water and light
 vishnu parthiv lokon kaa nirmaan or param vistrut antariksh aadi lokon kaa prasthaapan karne vaale hai
 They are the three types of movement in self-constructed worlds
 unki ye teen gatiyaan udbhav, sthiti or vilay kii pratik hai
 In this way, they are also the creators of everyone, both spinach and destroyer
 ve 'lokatray kaa akelaa dharak' hai
 They measure all three worlds alone with their three footprints
 lokatray ko naap lene se bhi yah falit hota he ki lokatray arthath vahaan ke samgr praani unke purna niyantran main hai
 Vishnu is also an embryo-protector
 garbhasth beej kii raksha ke liye or sundar balak kii utpatti ke liye vishnu kii prarthana kii jaati he
 Due to the clear emphasis on his foster nature, he has been called 'vishnurgopa Paraman Pati 

' meaning the protector of all, even in the Ahoratra fire form in the Rigveda
 acharya sayan rugveda ke ashtum mandal ke pachchisven sookt ke barahawein mantra kii vyakhya main bhi vishnu ko spasht rup se 'paalan se yukt' maanate hai
 xxrep 4 
 isliye samgr pariprekshya main rugveda main vishnu ko param hitaishi kaha gaya he
 Despite being mentioned in most mantras, Indra is called 'sukrit' and Vishnu is called 'sukritara'
 'sukruttarah' kaa acharya sayan ne 'uttam fal pradaan karne waalon main shreshth' arth kiya he; shripad satavlekar ji ne 'uttam karm karne waalon main sarvshereshth' arth kiya he or maharishi dayanand saraswati ji ne bhi 'ativ uttam karm vaala' arth kiya he
 Indra is 'sukrit' and Vishnu is 'sukritarah'
 taatpary spasht he ki rugveda main hi yah maan liya gaya he ki vishnu sarvocch hai
 Similarly, despite being the king of Indra, the supremacy of Vishnu is also clear in the Rigveda that in it it is said for Vishnu that "he holds the whole world alone" and Indra is told that he States do
 taatpary spasht he ki sristi ke sarjak evam paalak vishnu ne sanchaalan hetu indra ko raja banaaya he
 In this well-defined perspective, Brahmin texts related to the supremacy of Vishnu and later mythological beliefs also spontaneously emerge
 brahman-yug main yajna-sanstha kaa vipul vikaas hua or iske saath hi devamandali main vishnu kaa mahatva bhi pehle kii apeksha adhiktar ho gaya
 At the beginning of Aitareya Brahmana, in order to give place in yagya, starting with fire, Vishnu's place has been called 'param'
 inke madhya anya devataaon kaa sthaan he
 In this way, Vishnu has been given a much higher place in the Vedic Samhita texts than the fire that attained the foremost place
 vastutah vishnu ko mahattam to rugveda main bhi mana hi gaya he, par varnan kii alpata ke kaaran vahaan unka sthaan gaun lagata he
 He has been given the highest rank by the explicit statement in the Brahmin texts
 yah shreshthata is katha se bhi spasht hoti he ki vishnu ne apane teen pagon dwaara asuron se prithvi, veda tathaa vaani sab chhinakar indra ko de di
 This is the narrative conversion of the three steps of the Vedic Vishnu into Brahmins; And with this, the superiority of Vishnu also became clear in the Brahmin era itself
 aitarey brahman spasht rup se vishnu ko dwarpal kii tarah devataaon kaa sarvatha sangrakshak maanata he
 The signs available in the Rigveda and the Brahmins have had substantial additions to the Puranas - narrative as well, descriptive as well as explanatory
 puraanon ne is jagat ke mul main vartmaan, nity, ajanma, akshay, avyay, ekares tathaa hey ke abhaav se nirmal parabrahm ko hi vishnu sangya di he
 He is devoid of instructions and adjectives like 'paranaam Par:', the divine located in the inner soul, the supreme superior and the form, varna etc
 ve janm, vruddhi, parinaam, kshay or naash -- in chah vikaron se rahit hai
 They are widespread and the whole world is inhabited by them; That is why scholars call him 'vasudev'
 jis samay din, raat, akaash, prithvi, andhkaar, prakaash tathaa inke atirikt bhi kuch nahin tha, us samay ekmaatr vahi pradhan purush param brahm vidyaman the, jo ki indriyon or buddhi ke vishay nahin hai
 At the beginning of the universe, the same sentiment expressed by Lord Vishnu as Chatur Shloki Bhagwat in the original knowledge of Brahma, - i was the only one before creation
 mere atirikt na sthool tha na sookshm or na donon kaa kaaran agyaan
 Where this is not a creation, i am the one and i am the one who seems to be in the form of this creation and i am the one who will survive
 in sandarbhon se vishnu kii sarvocchata tathaa sarvaniyanta hone kii bhaavana spasht parilakshith hoti he
 Vishnu is believed to have two forms
 pratham rup-- pradhan purush or doosraa rup 'kaal' he
 These both combine and separate both creation and holocaust, or nature and man
 yah kaal rup bhagavan anadi tathaa anant hai; isliye sansar kii utpatti, sthiti or pralay bhi kabhi nahin rukate
 In the context of the origin of creation in the Bhagavata Maha Purana, known as the Sirmour of the Vaishnavas and the 'tilak of Puranas', it is said that the lotus emerged from the navel of Vishnu, who slept in Ekarnava, and realized all the qualities in it
 With the entry of Vishnu himself, the Vedmaya Brahma automatically emerged
 isi prakaar adhikansh puraanon main vishnu ko param brahm ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The Puranas are full of stories related to them
 paalankarta hone ke kaaran unhen jaagtik drushti se yada-kada vividh prapanchon kaa bhi sahaara lenaa padataa he
 Suggesting deception to be tricked by the Asuras, advising the gods on sea-churning for regaining sovereignty when the Asuras seize the kingdom; And by taking the form of erotic Mohini and enticing the Asuras to feed the nectar to the gods; Vishnu's deception in the stories mentioned in the sub-divisions like Devi Bhagwat and Shivpuran related to dissolving the essence of Tulsi for the slaughter of Shankhchud
 is sambandh main yah anivarytah dhyatavya he ki paalankarta hone ke kaaran ve parinaam dekhte hai
 Due to the disenfranchisement of the asuras / unjust by any boon, if the end of the unjust and deceit is scandalized, they do not hesitate to cheat
 ramavatar main chhipakar bali ko maarna tathaa krishnavatar main mahabharat yuddh main anek chhalon kaa vidhayak bananaa unke isi drushtikon kaa parichaayak he
 Carpenters use these stories as an antidote to arbitrary interpretation
 parantu inhen sandarbhik gyaan kii drushti se dekhnaa isliye aavashyak he kyonki puraanon yaa tatsambandhi granthon main ye prasang vipareet sthitiyon main saamaanya se itar vishisht kartavya ke gyaan hetu hi upasthaapit kiye gayi hai
 It is important to note that in Puranas, elemental knowledge is called Brahma, God and God
 vishnu kaa sampoorn swaroop gyanatmak he
 In the Puranas, the jewelery and armaments worn by them are also considered symbolic: - is prakaar samast srujanaatmak upadan tattvon ko vishnu apane sharir par dhaaran kiye rahete hai
 a stanza related to the figure of Srivishnu is very famous: - shantakaaran bhujagashyann padmanabhan sureshm
 Vishvadharan Gaganasudrash Megha Varnam Shubhangam
 
 Lakshmikantam Kamalanayanan Yogibhirdhyanagyam
 vande vishnu bhavabhayaharan sarvalokaikanatham
 
 bhavarth - jinaki akruti atishay shant he, jo sheshnag kii shaiya par shayan kiye hue hai, jinaki naabhi main camel he, jo devataaon ke bhi ishwar or sampurna jagat ke aadhaar hai, jo akaash ke sadrush sarvatra vyaapt hai, nilmegh ke samaan jinka varna he, atishay sundar jinke sampurna ang hai, jo yogiyon dwaara dhyaan karke praapt kiye jate hai, jo sampurna lokon ke swami hai, jo janm-maran rup bhay kaa naash karne vaale hai, aise lakshmipathi, kamalnetra bhagwaan vishnu ko main pranaam karata hoon
 Vishnu's superiority does not mean that Shiva or Brahma etc
 are inferior to him
 oonch-neech kaa bhav ishwar ke paas nahin hota
 It is just a priority to be virtuous in Leela for creation and operation
 isliye vaishnav ho yaa shaiva -- sabhi puraana tathaa mahabharat jaise shreshth granth ek swar se ghoshit karte hai ki ishwar ek hi hai
 It is said that the same Lord Janardhana holds these three nouns - 'brahma', 'vishnu' and 'shiva' - for the creation, condition and destruction of the world
 anekatra vishnu tathaa shiv ke ek hi hone ke spasht kathan uplabdh hote hai
 The word 'avatar' literally means the manifestation of God in the physical world through his independent power
 avatar kii siddhi do dashaon main maani jaati he -- ek to apane rup kaa parityag kar kaaryvash naveen rup kaa grahan; tathaa doosraa naveen janm grahan kar sambaddh rup main aana, jisamen mata ke garbh main uchit kaal tak ek sthiti kii baat bhi sannivisht he
 It does not involve changing the form for a short time or regaining the form of another
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke chaturth adhyay ke suprasiddh saatven evam aathven shloke main bhagavan ne swayan avatar kaa prayojan bataate hue kaha he ki -- jab-jab dharm kii haani or adharm kaa utthan ho jaataa he, tab-tab sajjanon ke paritran or dushton ke vinaash ke liye main vibhinn yugon main utpann hota hoon
 Apart from this, a specific and more lofty purpose has been said in the Bhagavata Mahapurana that God is beyond the nature of growth, destruction, etc
, is indestructible, eternal, nirguna
 to yadi ve avatar rup main apni lila ko prakat nahin karte to jeev unke ashesh gunon ko kaise samajhate? atah jeevon ke preranaroop kalyaan ke liye unhone apane ko tathaa apni lila ko prakat kiya
 Therefore, there are many odd situations in different avatar-stories so that the organism can understand what the proper path is according to the situation! vishnu ke avtaron kii pehali vyavasthit suchi mahabharat main uplabdh hoti he
 The total number of incarnations in Shantiparva of Mahabharata is stated to be 10: - hans: kurmashch matsyasch pradurbhava dwijottam

 Here, from the aforesaid incarnations, leaving the swan and adding the third Rama i
e
 Balarama, the number of Dash is complete
 is vivaran se ek baat pramanit ho jaati he ki mahabharat-kaal tak dash se adhik avtaron kii kalpana bhi nahin kii gayi thi; anyathaa un dash avtaron ko 'bhoot or bhavishya ke bhi sabhi avatar' nahin kaha gaya rahata
 Later, other avatars were also conceived and the total number of incarnations reached twenty-four
 bhagwat mahapurana main 22 tathaa 24 avtaron kii gananaa ke baavjood avtaron kii bahumanya sankhya mahabharat vaali dash hi rahi he
 Many Puranas like Padmapuran, Lingapurana, Varahapuran, Matsyapuran etc
 have mentioned about the same avatars
 agnipurana ke varnan main bhi bilkul vahi kram he
 The following verses of this context are generally universal: matsayah kurmo varahashch narsinghoth vamanh

 This 'gadar' or freedom struggle was planned by the 'gadar Party' which came into existence in America in 1913 and for this, about eight thousand Indians left India in the countries of America and Canada to liberate India from the British
 They had reached India on board ships

 Inspired by America's Free Earth This magnificent call to make our own land independent was inspired by the First War of Independence of 1857, and British colonialism, who contemptuously named 'gadar', used to honor the same 'gadar' word in America
 The settled Indian patriots adorned their party and its mouthpiece as 'gadar'

 The feature of the Ghadar Party movement is also worth underlining that the Ghadar Party did not end with the failure of the rebellion, rather it retained its international existence and by joining the Communist Party in India and maintaining a separate existence abroad, the Ghadar Party won the independence of India
 Contributed significantly in the struggle
 aage chal kar 1925-26 se punjab kaa yuvak vidroh, jiske lokapriy nayak bhagat singh bane, bhi gadar party va kartaar singh sarabha se atyant rup main prabhavit rahaa

 kartaar singh sarabha gadar party ke usee tarah nayak bane, jaise baad main 1925 - 31 ke dauraan bhagat singh krantikari andolan ke mahanayake bane
 It is not unnatural that Kartar Singh Sarabha was the most popular hero of Bhagat Singh, whose picture he always kept in his pocket and through a youth organization called 'naujawan Bharat Sabha', he narrated the life of Kartar Singh Sarabha from Punjab Used to show the inspiration of freedom among young men
 ‘noujvaan bharat sabha’ kii har jansabha main kartaar singh sarabha ke chitra ko manch par rakh kar use pushpanjali di jaati thi
 Kartar Singh Sarabha emerged as a folk hero of the Ghadar Party movement due to his very short political life activities

 The judges also wanted to avoid hanging such a hero hero and also gave Sarabha the advice and time to lighten the statement made in the court, but this heroic hero who became an inspiration for the young people of the country, instead of lightening the statement, hardened it
 And hanged laughing and laughing, raising his weight in joy after being hanged

 An Indian ruler who single-handedly forced the British to chew nuts
 iklauta aisa shaasha, jiskaa khauf angrejon main saaf-saaf dikhataa tha
 The only ruler with whom the British were willing to compromise unconditionally
 ek aisa shaasha, jise apano ne hi baar-baar dhokhaa diya, phir bhi jang ke maidan main kabhi himmat nahin haari
 The Indian ruler was so great, yet he is lost somewhere in the pages of history
 uske bare main aaj bhi bahut logon ko jaankaree nahin he
 His name is unknown to the people even today
 us mahaan shaasha kaa naam he - yashwantrao holkar
 This is the name of that great heroism, which has been compared by the famous historian NS Inamdar to 'napoleon'
 pashchim madhyapradesh kii malwa riyasat ke maharaj yashwantrao holkar kaa bharat kii aazaadee ke liye kiya gaya yogadan maharana pratap or jhaansi kii rani lakshmibai se kahin kam nahin he
 Yashwatrao Holkar was born in 1776 AD
 inke pita the - tukojirao holkar
 Due to the growing influence of the Holkar Empire, Daulatrao Scindia, the ruler of Gwalior, put Yashwantrao's elder brother Malharrao to death
 is ghatana ne yashwantrao ko puri tarah se tod diya tha
 They lost faith in their loved ones
 iske baad unhone khud ko majboot karnaa shuru kar diya
 He was very clever and brave in his work
 iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 1802 i
 main inhone pune ke peshwa bajirao dwitiya va sindhiya kii milijuli sena ko maat di or indore waapas aa gaye
 During this time, the British were spreading their feet fast in India
 yashavanth raav ke saamne ek nai chunauti saamne aa chuki thi
 To liberate India from the clutches of the British
 iske liye unhen anya bhartiya shaskaon kii sahaayta kii jarurat thi
 They wanted to stop the growing British empire
 iske liye unhone nagpur ke bhonsle or gwalior ke sindhiya se ekbar phir haath milaayaa or angrejon ko khadedane kii thaanee
 But due to old enmity, Bhonsle and Scindia betrayed him again and Yashwantrao once again fell alone
 unhone anya shaskaon se ekbar phir ekajute hokar angrejon ke khilaaf ladane kaa aagrah kiya, lekin kisi ne unki baat nahin maani
 After this he decided to remind the British of the milk of the sixth on his own
 8 june 1804 i
 ko unhone angrejon kii sena ko dhul chataayee
 Then on 8 July 1804 AD, he drove the British out of Kota
 11 sitambar 1804 i
 ko angrej general velesle ne lord ljuk ko likhaa ki yadi yashwantrao par jaldi kaabo nahin paaya gaya to ve anya shaskaon ke saath milakar angrejon ko bharat se khaded denge
 In view of this, in November 1804 AD, the British attacked Dig
 is yuddh main bharatpur ke maharaj ranjit singh ke saath milakar unhone angrejon ko unki nani yaad dilaai
 Not only this, according to history, he had cut off the nose of 300 British
 achaanak ranjit singh ne bhi yashwantrao kaa saath chhod diya or angrajon se haath mila liya
 After this, Scindia shook hands with Yashwantrao's bravery
 angrejon kii chintaa bad gai
 Lord Luke wrote that Yashwantrao's army takes great pleasure in killing the British
 iske baad angrejon ne yah faisla kiya ki yashwantrao ke saath sandhi se hi baat sanbhal sakati he
 Therefore an unconditional treaty should be made with them
 unhen jo chahie, de diya jaae
 All the empire they have, all should be returned
 iske baavjood yashwantrao ne sandhi se inkaar kar diya
 They were engaged in uniting all the rulers
 ant main jab unhen safalataa nahin mili to unhone duusari chaal se angrejon ko maat dene kii sochi
 In view of this, he made a treaty with the British in 1805 AD
 angrejon ne unhen swatantra shaasha mana or unke saare kshetra lautaa die
 After this, he along with Scindia made another plan to drive out the British
 unhone sindhiya ko khat likhaa, lekin sindhiya dagebaaj nikle or vah khat angrejon ko dikhaa diya
 After this, the whole matter worsened again
 yashwantrao ne hallaa bol diya or angrejon ko akele dam par maat dene kii puri taiyaari main jute gaye
 For this, he opened an ammunition factory in Bhanpur
 isbaar unhone angrejon ko khadedane kii thaan lee thi
 Therefore, they were busy working day and night
 lagaataar mehnat karne ke kaaran unka swasthya bhi girane laga
 But he did not pay attention to this and he went to heaven on 28 October 1811 AD at the age of just 35 years
 is tarah se ek mahaan shaasha kaa ant ho gaya
 a ruler over whom the British could never accumulate authority
 ek aise shaasha kaa jinhone apni choti umr ko jang ke maidan main jhonk diya
 If the Indian rulers had supported them, perhaps the picture would have been different, but this did not happen and a great ruler Yashwantrao Holkar was lost and lost his bravery in the pages of history, which remains unknown today

 Impressed by his work, Vasudev was invited to join Mumbai's progressive artist group
 unhone sakriy rup se samooh kii gatividhiyon main bhaag liya
 Many exhibitions were held in India as well as abroad
 1956 main, unhone bhartiya kala pradarshnee main bhaag liya jo purvi europea deshon main yojit kii gai thi
 He also participated in other group exhibitions held in 1959 and 1963 at the Graham Art Gallery, New York
 gayatonde kii amoort kritiyaan aadhunik kala sangrahalay, neuyork sahit kai bhartiya evam videshi sankalnon main prastut kii gai hai
 In 1957, he was awarded the first prize at the Young Asian Artists' Exhibition in Tokyo and the Rockefeller Fellowship in 1964
 1971 main, unhen srujanaatmak utkrushtataa ke liye bharat sarkaar dwaara die gaye sarvocch puraskaar arthath padam shri se sammanit kiya gaya
 Gaitonde used excessive form and shape in his works

 In the midst of his artwork, the control and consolidated structure can be seen to be finely painted
 gayatonde ne apane samakaleen kalakaaron ke vipareet ek dhimi evam sookshm chitrakala prakriya pasand kii, jiske kaaran unhone keval kuch hi purna kritiyon ko prastut kiya
 Gaitonde's symbolic element and very little use of baselines made his work look like a flowing river
 Gaitonde's works remind us of Paul Klee and Joan Miró with whom he studied during his college days
 gayatonde ke mohak drishyon ne darshak ko uski ullekhneey uplabdhi kii prashansa karne ke liye mugdh kiya or inamen se logon ke kai josh unki maarmik chhaviyon kii gahanta se prabhavit hue

 Gaitonde was undoubtedly one of the most serious and thought-provoking artists of India, who has established his legendary presence and influenced his divine vision in the theory of contemporary Indian art
 gayatonde kaa janm 1924 main nagpur, maharashtra ke ek goa parivaar main hua
 He completed his Diploma in Arts in 1948 from JJ School of Arts, Bombay
 1947 main or goa ke ek anya antarrashtriya khyaati praapt chitrakaar, francis newton sausa or saath hi saath anya kalakaar mitron ke saath, upniveshvaadi shastreey roodhiwaadita dwaara damanaatmak dhang se thope gaye ateet se dur hokar vyapak jaagrukta ke saath, unhone 'pragatisheel kalakaar samooh' kii sthapana kii tathaa ek antarrashtriya vakstyle ke liye maarg prashast karne ke liye bhartiyata par adhikaar jamaaya
 is andolan ne aadhunik bhartiya kala ko pariprekshya main rakhte hue desh main aaj ke jeevant kala parivesh kii sthapana kii
 Gaitonde was involved in the secondary activity of this historical group, but this was evident in one of my conversations with him, saying: "I was different from it
 " ve kabhi bhi samooh ke prati udasin nahin the lekin ek vyakti ke rup main yah unke kalatmak vyaktitv kii mukhya visheshta thi
 He had a strong belief in his non-conforming nature as well as his identity as a painter and due to his persistence, Gaitonde separated himself from all that was in his surroundings at the very beginning of his career
 He considered it irrelevant to his identity as a painter
 varshon tak unke vikaas kii visheshta badhati hui aantarik avasthaa evam is pahchaan kaa satark tathaa sachet drudhikaran tha
 He was once described by one of his admirers as "a calm-minded man and a painter with full reach of imagination" who best defines Gaitonde, in which an intellectual, in fact, the externality of boiling inwardly with some unknown idea
 was
 vaicharik rup se, unhone kabhi bhi swayan ko ek amoort chitrakaar nahin mana evam ve aisa kaha janaa pasand bhi nahin karte hai
 In fact, he insists that there is no such thing as abstract painting, instead he describes his work as "non-objective", a sort of personalized pictographic and calligraphic invention that refreshes the painted surface with an intuitive sense , Which he understood in the mandatory meeting to search for Zen
 unke bhaashan se prakat hone vaali chintansheel zen gunvattta main bhaavnaatmak maun kii sarvshereshth misaal milti he, kyonki khamoshi apane aap main shaashvat evam arthpurna hoti he, is drushtikon se vyakti main rahasyamay moolbhaavon ke pahchaan karne kii pravriti nahin hoti he
 Gaitonde's canvases reveal the highly individualized portraits in various colorful sequences with the reveal of innate sensations, opening the space that is to be filled by the brain
 gayatonde ke chitron main rang ke paraspar prabhaav ke saath sanrachanaatmak banaavat mukhya upkaran hai jo chitrakala ke rahasyamay "aatm" ko gati main sanchalit karata he, yah pavitra lekin antarnihit hota he, yah kabhi bhi hathpurna nahin hota he
 His compositions include vivacity that speeds up a dynamically balanced configuration in a kinetic energy-like manner, as Gaitonde controlled his representations with the sensation of form that was inevitable
 unhone apane swayan ke aatanrik ekatal sambandhi jivan vaale ek ang, rang main prayek sanrachana kii yojana banaai
 chunki gayatonde kii kala ek tivrata main shuru hoti he jo swayan ko parishkrut karne kii taraf nirantar agrasar hoti he evam unka prayek kshan darshanik rup se chintansheel hota he evam isliye unhen koi bhi cheez apane bhitari sthanon evam kshanik vaastaviktaaon kii talash karne main srujanaatmak prerana ke kshetra se nahin roak sakati he
 His paintings are related only to themselves, the process is the result, the non-objective delusions in art are the same as in life
 gayatonde darshakon ko unke chitron ko ekatak dekhne ke liye baadhya karte hai kyonki ve rup, rang evam chitrakala kaa ek adbhut bhram chitrit karte hai
 They have the ability to turn ordinary things into metaphysics
 is kalakaar kii chhayankan main jabardast pratibha or kaushal he jo unki kriti ko kabhi khatm nahin hone vaale vital kaa rup pradaan karata he
 Gaitonde uses a roller and a color-mixing knife to fully influence various mediums and mix them on canvas
 unki kalakriti kisi anya rup main lupt ho jane vaale prayek tatv ke saath utkrisht hoti hui maaloom padati he
 His abstract paintings with their luminous lighting elements create secret depth
 gayatonde kii kriti canvas par vishaal samatli satahon evam rangon ke sookshm paraton se ek chintansheel soundarya bikherti maaloom padati he
 His paintings have a characteristic of light which seems to fulfill it
 unki kriti rangon kaa nirmaan karti hai evam baad main unhen gayatonde dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye vaanchit prabhaav ke liye saavdhaneepurvak hataa diya jaataa he
 VS Gaitonde was the first Indian contemporary painter whose work was sold for Rs 92 lakh at the Ossian art auction
 gayatonde kii 2002 main mrityu ho gai
 VS Gaitonde is still regarded as India's most prominent abstractionist and a spiritual painter

 The thoughtful Zen quality reflected by his speech exemplifies the best of emotional silence, as silence is in itself eternal and expressive, with the view that a person does not have a tendency to recognize mysterious traits

 However, there have been occasions in history when provincial governors have been given additional and full authority, especially in cases when the provincial legislature has been dissolved, then administrative powers fall directly under the governor's jurisdiction; As it had been in military rule since 1958, from 1972 and 1977 to 1985, military rule from 1999 to 2002

 All the Ramayana sculptures are inscribed on its walls
 is mandir ko dekhne se gyaat hota he ki videshon main jaakar bhi pravasi kalakaaron ne bhartiya kala ko jivit rakhaa tha
 It is evident from this that the worship of Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh and other gods was prevalent in Angkorthom which was the capital of Kambuj country
 in mandiron ke nirmaan main jis kala kaa anukaran hua he vah bhartiya gupt kala se prabhavit jaan padati he
 The Gupta art is reflected in the embellishments of Angkorwat's temples, archways and pinnacles
