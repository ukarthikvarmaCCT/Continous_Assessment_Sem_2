 They had a son, Sandeep, who is now a film director himself

 Rai helped Ranwar find a suitable place in the countryside
 raay ne unhen pather panchali par film banane kaa apana vichaar bataaya to ranvar ne unhen iske liye protsaahit kiya
 In 1950, D
J
 Kemer sent Rai to the agency's headquarters in London
 landan main bitaye teen maheenon main raay ne 99 filmein dekhin
 These included the neoliberal film Ladri di Bicicletta of Financorio de Sica, which impressed him even further
 raay ne baad main kaha ki ve cinema se baahar aae to film nirdeshak banane ke liye drudhsankalp the
 The success in films did not change Rai's family life too much
 ve apni maan or parivaar ke anya sadasyon ke saath hi ek kiraye ke makaan main rahete rahe
 In the 1960s, Rai traveled to Japan and met well-known film director Akira Kurosawa
 bharat main bhi ve aksar shahar ke bhaagam-bhaag vaale maahaul se bachane ke liye darjeeling yaa puri jaisi jagahon par jaakar ekaant main kathanak puure karte the
 While working on the film Ghare Byre in 1983, Rai suffered a heart attack which severely reduced his performance in the remaining 9 years of his life
 ghare bire kaa chhayankan raay ke bete kii madad se 1984 main puraa hua
 In 1992, Rai's health deteriorated due to debility of the heart, from which he could never recover
 mrityu se kuch hi hafte pehle unhen sammaandaayak academy puraskaar diya gaya
 He died on 23 April 1992
 inaki mrityu hone par kolkata shahar lagbhag thahar gaya or hazaron log inke ghar par inhen shradhanjali dene aae
 Rai had decided that his first film would be based on the famous Bildungsaromon Pather Panchali of Bengali literature, written in 1928 by Bibhuti Bhushan Bandyopadhyay
 is ardh-aatmakathaatmak upanyaas main ek bengali gaanv ke ladke apu ke bade hone kii kahani he
 Rai designed the film during his return voyage from London to India
 bharat pahunchne par raay ne ek karmidal ekatrit kiya jisamen cameraman subrat mitra or kala nirdeshak bansi chandragupta ke alaava kisi ko filmon kaa anubhav nahin tha
 The actors were also almost all unprofessional
 film kaa chhayankan 1952 main shuru hua
 Rai invested his money in this film, in the hope that the first few shots would get money from somewhere, but it did not happen
 pather panchali kaa chhayankan teen varsh ke lambe samay main hua — jab bhi raay yaa nirmaan prabandhak anil choudhary kahin se paison kaa jugad kar pate the, tabhi chhayankan ho paata tha
 Rai refused to take money from sources who wanted to change the plot or supervise the filmmaker
 1955 main pashchim bengal sarkaar ne film ke liye kuch rin diya jisase aakhirkaar film puri hui
 The government also wanted to make some changes in the film but Satyajit Rai paid no attention to it
 pather panchali 1955 main pradarshit hui or bahut lokapriy rahi
 In India and other countries also it was engaged in cinema for a long time
 bharat ke aalochakon ne ise bahut saraahaa
 The Times of India wrote - “to compare it to any other Indian cinema is meaningless
 pather panchali to shuddh cinema he
 Lindsey Anderson in the United States wrote a very good review about the film
 lekin sabhi aalochak film ke bare main itane utsahit nahin the
 François Truffo said - "I do not see a film showing people eating food by hand
" ” new york times ke prabhaavshaalee aalochak bozli crouther ne bhi pather panchali ke bare main bahut buree samiksha likhi
 Despite this, the film went on for a long time in America
 raay kii agali film aparajito kii safalataa ke baad inkaa antararashtriya karier puure jor-shor se shuru ho gaya
 The film depicts the frequent stretch between the aspirations of a young man and his mother
 mrinal sen or ruthvik ghatak sahit kai aalochak ise pehali film se behatar maanate hai
 Aparajito was awarded the Swarn Singh at the Venice Film Festival
 apu trayee puri karne se pehle raay ne do or filmein banaain — hasyaprad parsh pathar or zameendaaron ke patan par aadhaarit jalsaghar
 The aquarium is counted among his most important works
 aparajito banaate hue raay ne trayee banane kaa vichaar nahin kiya tha, lekin venice main uthe ek prashn ke baad unhen yah vichaar acha laga
 The final episode of this series, Apur Sansar, was formed in 1959
 raay ne is film main do nae abhinaytaon, saumitr chatarji or sharmila tagore, ko mauka diya
 In this film, Apu lives in poverty in a simple house in Kolkata and gets married to Aparna, after which he has to face many difficulties
 pichhali do filmon kii tarah hi kuch aalochak ise trayee kii sabase badhiya film maanate hai 
 When a Bengali critic strongly criticized the Apur Sansar, Rai wrote a long article in response to this
 is avadhi main raay ne kai vishyon par filmein banaain, jinamein shaamil hai, british kaal par aadhaarit devi, rabindranath thakur par ek vruttchitr, hasyaprad film mahapurush or moulik kathanak par aadhaarit inaki pehali film kanchanajangha 
 During this time, he made many such films, which together are considered to be the deepest portrayal of women in Indian cinema
 apur sansar ke baad raay kii pehali film thi devi, jisamen inhone hindu samaaj main andhvishwaas ke vishay ko tatola he
 Sharmila Tagore played the main character of the film, Dayamayi, who is considered to be an incarnation of her father-in-law Kali
 raay ko chintaa thi ki is film ko sensor board se shaayad sweekruti nahin mili, yaa unhe kuch drishy kaatane paden, lekin aisa nahin hua
 In 1961, at the insistence of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Rai made a documentary on Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur's birth centenary on his life
 thakur ke jivan kaa filmakan bahut kam hi hua tha, isliye raay ko mukhyatah sthir chitron kaa prayog karnaa padaa, jisamen unke anusaar teen fichar filmon jitna parishram hua
 In the same year, Rai along with Subhash Mukhopadhyay and other writers revived the children's magazine Sandesh
 is patrika kii shuruyaat inke dada ne shuru kii thi or bahut samay se raay iske liye dhan jamaa karte aa rahe the
 Sandesh means two-way in Bangla - one is news and the other is sweets
 patrika ko isi mul vichaar par banaaya gaya — shiksha ke saath-saath manoranjan
 Rai soon started drawing himself in magazines and writing stories and essays for children
 aane vaale varshon main lekhan inaki jeevika kaa pramukh saadhan ban gaya
 In 1962, Rai directed Kanchanjangha, in which he first did colorful cinematography on the original plot
 is film main ek ucch varg ke parivaar kii kahani he jo darjeeling main ek dopaher bitaate hai or prayaas karte hai ki sabase choti beti kaa vivaah landan main padhe ek kamau ejeeniyar ke saath ho jaae
 Initially the idea was to portray the film in a sprawling mansion, but Rai later decided to use the Darjeeling atmosphere and play of light and fog to showcase the plot vibe
 raay ne hansi main ek baar kaha ki unki film kaa chhayankan kisi bhi roshni main ho saktaa tha, lekin usee samay darjeeling main maujuud ek vyavsaayik film dal ek bhi drishy nahin shoot kar paaya kyonki unhone keval dhoop main hi shooting kerani thi
 In 1964, Rai made a Charulata film, which many critics consider to be his most masterminded film
 yah thakur kii laghukatha nashtnid par aadhaarit he
 It contains the story of a lonely 19th-century woman who falls in love with her brother-in-law
 ise raay kii sarvotkrisht kriti mana jaataa he
 Rai himself said that it has the least flaws and this is the only film that he will recreate in the same way when he gets a chance
 chaaru ke rup main madhavi mukherjee ke abhinay or subrat mitra or bansi chandragupta ke kaam ko bahut saraahaa gaya he
 Other films of this period are: Mahanagar, Teen Kanya, Abhiyan, Kapurush and Mahapurush
 charulatha ke baad ke kaal main raay ne vividh vishyon par aadhaarit filmein banaain, jinamein shaamil hai, kalpanakthaayen, vigyankathaayen, guptchar kathaayen or aitihaasik naatak
 Rai started experimenting on new techniques in films and focusing on contemporary themes in India
 is kaal kii pehali mukhya film thi nayak, jisamen ek film abhinayta rail main safar karte hue ek mahila patrkaar se miltaa he
 The film, based on 24-hour events, explores the psychology of this famous actor
 berlin main is film ko aalochak puraskaar mila, lekin anya pratikriyaayein adhik utsaahpurn nahin raheen
 In 1967, Rai wrote the script for a film called To Be The Alien
 yah inaki laghukatha bankubabur bandhu par aadhaarit thi jise inhone sandesh patrika ke liye 1962 main likhaa tha
 The producer of this america-india co-production project was a company called Colombia Pictures
 peter sellers or marlan brando ko isaki mukhya bhoomikaaon ke liye chunaa gaya
 Rai was surprised to learn that his plot had been taken over by someone else
 brando baad main is pariyojna se nikal gaye or raay kaa bhi is film se moh-bhang ho gaya
 Colombia attempted to revive the project several times in the 1970s and 80s, but the matter never progressed
 raay ne is pariyojna kii asafalataa ke kaaran 1980 ke ek site and sound praaroop main ginaae hai or anya vivaran inke aadhikarik jeevani lekhak andru robinson ne da inner aai main diye hai
 When in 1982 E
T
 When the film was released, Rai saw many similarities between his plot and the film
 raay kaa vishwaas tha ki steven spilberg kii yah film unke kathanak ke bina sambhav nahin thi 
 In 1969, Rai made his most commercially successful film - Guppy Gine Bagha Baine
 yah sangitamay film inke dada dwaara likhi ek kahani par aadhaarit he
 The king of ghosts gives three boons to the singer Goopi and Dholi Bagha, with the help of which they stop the war in two neighboring countries
 yah raay ke sabase kharchile udhyamon main se thi or iske liye puunji bahut mushkil se mili
 Rai eventually had to abandon the idea of making it colorful
 raay kii agali film thi aranyer dinaraatri, jisaki sangeet-sanrachana charulatha se bhi jatil maani jaati he
 It has the story of four young men who go to the jungle for holiday
 isamen simi gareval ne ek junglee jati kii aurat kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 Critics consider it an image of the mentality of the Indian middle class
 iske baad raay ne samasamyik bengali vaastaviktaa par dhyaan dena shuru kiya
 The Naxalite revolution was gaining momentum in Bengal at that time
 aise samay main navayuvakon kii maansikta ko lekar inhone kalakatta trayee ke naam se jane vaali teen filmein banaain — pratidwandvi, seemaabaddh or jayeerany 
 The imagery of these three films differs but the themes of these together take the form of a trilogy
 pratidwandvi ek adarshavaadi navayuvak kii kahani he jo samaaj se moh-bhang hone par bhi apane adarsh nahin tyaagta he
 In this, Rai adopted a new style of storytelling, in which he used scenes, dream scenes and accidental flash-backs in the negative
 jayeerany film main ek navayuvak kii kahani he jo jeevika kamaane ke liye bhrasht rahon par chalane lagata he
 a successful young man gives up his ethics in order to earn more money
 raay ne 1970 ke dashak main apni do lokapriy kahaniyon — sonar kella or joy baba felunath — kaa filmakan kiya
 Both films were very popular among both children and adults
 raay ne bangladesh mukti yuddh par bhi ek film banane kii sochi, lekin baad main yah vichaar tyaag diya kyonki unhen raajnneeti se adhik sharnaarthiyon ke palaayan or haalat ko samajhane main adhik ruchi thi
 In 1977, Rai made a chess player film based on the story of Munshi Premchand
 yah urdu bhashaa kii film 1857 ke bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke ek varsh pehle avadh rajya main lakhanu shahar main kendrit he
 It highlights the reasons for India's enslavement
 isamen bollywood ke bahut se sitaron ne kaam kiya, jinamein pramukh hai — sanjeev kumaar, said jafari, amjad khan, shabana aazmi, victor bannerjee or richard atonbaro
 In 1980 Rai carried forward the story of Gupi Gaine Bagha Baine, a film called Heerak Raj in which the king of diamonds pointed to India during Indira Gandhi's Emergency
 is kaal kii do anya filmein thi — laghu film pikur diary yaa piku or ghante-bhar lambi hindi film sadgati
 Rai had been thinking of making a film based on Thakur's novel Ghare Byre for a long time
 beemaari kii vajah se isamen kuch bhaag utkrisht nahin hai, lekin film ko saraahna bahut mili
 In 1987, he made a documentary on the life of his father Sukumar Rai
 raay kii aakhri teen filmein unki beemaari ke kaaran mukhyatah aantarik sthanon main shoot huin or is kaaran se ek vishisht style kaa anusaran karti hai
 They have more dialogue and are placed lower than the rest of Rai's films
 inamen se pehali, ganashatru, henrik ibasan ke prakhyat naatak en anemi of da pipal par aadhaarit he or in teenon main se sabase kamjor maani jaati he
 Rai regained some of his old quality in the 1990 film Shakha Prashakha
 isamen ek buudhe aadmi kii kahani he, jisane apana puraa jivan eemaandaaree se bitaayaa hota he, lekin apane teen beton ke bhrasht aacharan kaa pataa lagane par use keval apane chauthe, maansik rup se biimaar, bete kii sangat raas aati he
 Rai's final film Agantuk has a mild atmosphere but the subject is very cryptic
 isamen ek bhuulaa-bisraa mamaa apni bhanji se achaanak milane aa pahunchataa he, to uske aane ke vaastavik kaaran par shankaa kii jane lagati he
 Satyajit Rai believed that writing the plot is an integral part of direction
 yah ek kaaran he jisaki vajah se unhone prarambh main bangla ke atirikt kisi bhi bhashaa main film nahin banaai
 For both his films made in other languages, he first wrote the plot in English, which was translated by the translators into Hindi or Urdu under his supervision
 raay ke kala nirdeshak bansi chandragupta kii drushti bhi raay kii tarah hi paini thi
 His influence on early films was so important that Rai wrote the plot first in English so that Chandragupta, who did not know Bengali, could understand it
 shuruaati filmon ke chhayankan main subrat mitra kaa kaary bahut saraahaa jaataa he or aalochak maanate hai ki anban hone ke baad jab mitra chale gaye to raay kii filmon ke chitrankan kaa str ghat gaya
 Rai praised Mitra very much, but Rai used to make films with such concentration that Rai started running the camera himself after Charulata, due to which Mitra stopped working for Rai from 1966
 mitra ne bouns-prakaash kaa sarvapratham prayog kiya jisamen ve prakaash ko kapade par se oochaal kar vaastavik prathit hone vaala prakaash rach lete the
 Rai also considered himself indebted to the French neo-wave's jan-luc Godar and François Truffo, whose new technological and cinema experiments were used by Rai in his films
 haalanki dulaal datta raay ke niyamit film sampadak the, raay aksar sampadan ke nirnay khud hi lete the or datta baaki kaam karte the
 In fact editing was often done on camera due to economic reasons and efficient planning of opinion
 shuru main raay ne apni filmon ke sangeet ke liye liye ravi shankar, vilaayat khaan or ali abbar khaan jaise bhartiya shastreey sangitagnon ke saath kaam kiya, lekin raay ko lagane laga ki in sangitagnon ko film kii apeksha sangeet kii sadhana main adhik ruchi he
 Also, Rai also had knowledge of western music which he wanted to use in films
 in kaarnon se teen kanya ke baad se filmon kaa sangeet bhi raay khud hi rachane lage
 Rai worked with actors with diverse backgrounds, some of whom were noted stars, while some had never even seen the film
 raay ko bacchon ke abhinay ke nirdesan ke liye bahut saraahaa gaya he, visheshat: apu evam durga, ratan or mukul 
 According to the skill and experience of the actor, Rai's direction was sometimes negligible, sometimes he used the actors as puppets
 raay kii kritiyon ko maanavtaa or samshti se ot-prot kaha gaya he
 These often have deep complexity hidden behind external simplicity
 inaki kritiyon ko anyaanya shabdon main saraahaa gaya he
 Akira Kurosawa said, "not watching Rai's cinema is like living in this world without seeing the sun or the moon
" ” aalochakon ne inaki kritiyon ko anya kai kalakaaron se tulana kii he — anton chekhav, zaan ranvar, vittorio de sika, harvard hox, motsart, yahan tak ki shakespeare ke samatuly paaya gaya he
 Naipaul compared a scene from a chess player to Shakespeare's plays - "only three hundred words were spoken, but only so many wonderful events happened!" Critics who do not find Rai's films to be elegant also believe that Rai was unique in bringing the image of an entire culture to the film
 raay kii aalochana mukhyatah inaki filmon kii gati ko lekar kii jaati he
 Critics say that they run at the speed of a "royal snail"
 raay ne khud mana ki ve is gati ke bare main kuch nahin kar sakate, lekin kurosava ne inkaa paksh lete hue kaha, “inhen dhimaa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 They flow in peace like a huge river
 ” iske atirikt kuch aalochak inaki maanavtaa ko sada or inke kaaryon ko aadhuniktaa-virdohi maanate hai or kehete hai ki inaki filmon main abhivyakti kii nai sheliyaan nahin nazar aati hai
 He says that Rai “assumes that the audience will be interested in a film that focuses only on the characters, rather than a film that brings a new twist to their lives
 ” Rai has also been criticized by politicians of socialist ideologies
 inke anusaar raay pichde samudaayon ke logon ke utthan ke liye patibaddh nahin the, balki apni filmon main garibi kaa soundaryikaran karte the
 They did not even suggest ways to resolve conflicts and conflicts in their stories
 1960 ke dashak main raay or mrinal sen ke bich ek saarvajanik bahes hui
 Mrinal Sen was clearly a Marxist and according to him Rai compromised with his ideals by filming a famous actor like Uttam Kumar
 raay ne palatakar jawaab diya ki sen apni filmon main keval bengali madhyam varg ko hi nishaanaa banaate hai kyonki is varg kii aalochana karnaa aasaan he
 In 1980, MP and actress Nargis openly criticized Rai for "exporting poverty" and demanded that he make films depicting modern India
 raay ne bangla bhashaa ke bal-sahitya main do lokapriy charitron kii rachana kii — guptchar feluda or vaigyanik profesar shanku
 He also wrote a number of short stories, which were published in a compilation of twelve stories each, and his name always consisted of twelve related words
 udhaaharan ke liye eker pithe dui 
 Rai loved riddles and multi-word words
 ise inaki kahaniyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he – feluda ko aksar maamle kii tah tak jane ke liye paheliyaan sulajhaani padati hai
 Like Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson, Feluda's stories are narrated by his cousin Topse
 professor shanku kii vigyankathaayen ek dainandini ke rup main hai jo shanku ke achaanak gaayab ho jane ke baad milti he
 Rai has uncovered the unknown and exciting elements in these stories, which are not seen in his films
 inaki lagbhag sabhi kahaniyaan hindi, angreji or anya bhashaaon main anudit ho chuki hai
 Almost all of Rai's narratives have also been published in the Bangla language literary magazine Ekshan
 raay ne 1982 main aatmakatha likhi jakhan choti chhilam 
 Apart from this, he has written several books on the subject of films, the main ones being Our Films, There Films
 1976 main prakashit is pustak main raay kii likhi aalochanaon kaa sankalan he
 The first part details Indian cinema and the second part focuses on Hollywood
 raay ne charlie chaplin or akira kurosava jaise nirdeshkon or italvi navayatharthwaad jaise vishyon par vishesh dhyaan diya he
 It was in 1976 that he published another book - Subject Film which contains a brief account of his thinking on various aspects of cinema
 iske atirikt inaki ek or pustak ekei bole shooting or filmon par anya niabandh bhi prakashit hue hai
 Rai has also written Bandai Bandha Ghodar Dim, a compilation of absurd poems, including a translation of Louis Carol's poem Jabberwocky
 inhone bangla main mullah nasruddin kii kahaniyon kaa sankalan bhi prakashit kiya
 Rai has received many awards and honors in his life
 oxuard vishvavidhyalay ne inhen maanad doctoret kii oopaadhiyaan pradaan kii
 He was the first film director to receive this honor after Charlie Chaplin
 inhen 1985 main dadasahab phalke puraskaar or 1987 main frans ke lezyon da’onu puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Shortly before his death, he was awarded the honorable Academy Award and Bharat Ratna, India's highest honor
 maranoparant san frencisco antararashtriya filmotsav main inhen nirdesan main jivan-paryant uplabdhi-swaroop akira kurosava puraskaar mila jise inaki ore se sharmila tagore ne grahan kiya
 It is generally understood that the films he made after a heart attack did not have the same vigor as before
 unka vyaktigat jivan kabhi media ke nishane par nahin rahaa lekin kuch kaa vishwaas he ki 1960 ke dashak main film abhinetri madhavi mukherjee se unke sambandh rahe
 Satyajit Rai is a cultural icon for the Bengali community in India and around the world
 bengali cinema par raay ne amit chhap chodi he
 Many Bangla directors have been inspired by his work - Aparna Sen, Rituparna Ghosh, Gautam Ghosh, Tariq Masood and Tanvir Mukammal
 bhartiya cinema par inke prabhaav ko har style ke nirdeshak maanate hai, jinamein buddhadev dasgupta, mrinal sen or adur gopalkrishnan shaamil hai
 Outside India, directors like Martin Sorsisi, James Ivory, Abbas Kiyarostami and Elia Kazan have also been influenced by his style

 ulte unhen nindit kiya gaya or hindu dharm vinaashak tak kaha gaya

 hindu samaaj main samanta ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 "hindu society used to say that" humans are for religion "while Ambedkar believed that" religions are for humans
 " " ambedkar ne kaha ki aise dharm kaa koi matlab nahin jisamen manushyata kaa kuch bhi mulya nahin
 There is no point in living in such a religion which does not allow the followers of their own religion to get religious education, interrupts their jobs, insults them and even gives them water

 He said that man wants these things for auspicious and happy life

 hakim abul kasim firdausi tusi farsi kavi the
 He composed the Shahnama which later became the national epic of Persia
 isamen unhone saatvin sadi main faras par arabi fatah ke pehle ke iran ke bare main likhaa he
 Firdausi was born in 920 AD in a town called Tus in Khorasan
 asadi naamak kavi ne use shiksha di or kavita kii ore prerit kiya
 He gave him a treatise on the mythological kings of Iran, on the basis of which Firdausi composed the Shahnama
 isamen 60,000 sher hai
 He was busy with this great work for 35 years and completed it on 25 February 1010 AD
 is samay vah 85 varsh kaa ho chukaa tha
 He dedicated this poem to Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi who conquered Khorasan in 999 AD
 use keval 20 hajaar dirham pradaan kiye gaye
 Firdausi's body was set on fire
 vah apane desh se hiraat kii ore bhaaga kintu bhaagane se purv ek kavita shahname main jod gaya, jisamen sultan mahmud kii ghor ninda kii gai he
 In the Shahnama, Firdausi praised the legendary emperor of Iran, whose exploits he was greatly influenced by, the elder
 uski kavita se pracheen iran ke prati uskaa prem evam arabon ke prati ghrinaa kaa puraa abhas miltaa he
 In order to possibly satisfy the staunch Muslims, he later wrote Yusuf Zulikha, a masnavi dedicated to the Bavid ruler Bahauddaula and his son Sultanuddaula
 taduparant vah apni mathrubhumi toos laut aayaa or vahiin uski mrityu hui 
 His grave is in the sights of Iran
 kaha jaataa he, jab uskaa janaaza paas ke ek gaanv ke phatak se nikal rahaa tha, ek kaaravaan sultan mahmud ke bheje hue 60,000 dinar lekar pahunchaa jinaki kavi ko aashaa thi
 Firdausi's daughter put all the money in charity
 shahnamaa kii badi hi sundar sachitr hastlipiyaan sansar ke bade bade sangrahalayon main surakshit hai
 Its editions were published from Calcutta in 1878 AD from Paris in 1878 and Lyden from 1877-1885 AD
 taduparant bharat or iran se anek sanskaran prakashit hue
 Its translations have been published in many languages of the world
 kaha jaataa he ki mahmud gazanvi ne firdausi ko yah vachan diya tha ki vah 'shahnamaa' ke har shabd ke liye ek dinar degaa
 After years of hard work, when the 'shahnama' was ready and Firdausi took him to the court of Mahmud Ghaznabi, the emperor paid him a dirham, not a dinar for every word
 kaha jaataa he is par naaraaz hokar firdausi laut gaya or usne ek dirham bhi nahin liya
 This promise was something like that a penny should be given to a poet by paying a rupee per word
 firdausi ne gusse main aakar mahmud gazanabi ke khilaaf kuch panktiyaan likhi
 Those lines were so influential that they spread throughout the empire
 kuch saal baad mahmud gazanvi se uske vishwaasapaatr mantriyon ne nivedan kiya ki firdausi ko usee dar par bhugtan kar diya jaye jo tay kii gayi thi
 When asked about the reason of the emperor, the Prime Minister said that in every corner of the empire we go, we get to hear the lines that Firdausi has written against you and we just bow down in shame
 use nirdhaarit dar par paisa de diya jaayegaa to hamen bada naitik bal milegaa
 The Emperor gave the order
 dinaaron se bhari gaadi jab firdausi ke ghar pahunchi to ghar ke andar se firdausi kaa janaaza nikal rahaa tha
 Firdausi was dead after spending his entire life in poverty, poverty and failure
 kehete hai ki firdausi kii ekmaatr santan uski ladki ne bhi yah dhan lene se inkaar kar diya tha
 In this way the emperor remained a debtor of the poet and still is today
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki aaj firdausi kaa shahnamaa jitna prasiddh he utani hi yaa usase zyada prasiddh ve panktiyaan he jo firdausi ne mahmud gazanabi kii aalochana karte hue likhi thim
 Firdausi's 'shahnama' is not only the history of Iran but the identity of Iranian identity
 usamen pracheen iran kii uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan he
 Emperors have a history
 pracheen farsi granthon ko nayaa rup dekar unako shaamil kiya gaya he
 a wonderful effect has arisen from the blending of myth and history
 prem, vidroh, veerta, dushtataa, maanviyata, yuddh, saahas ke aise utkrisht udhaaharan hai jinhone 'shahnamaa' ko irani sahitya kii amar kriti bana diya he
 No other book has appeared in Iranian literature as often as 'shahnama' has been printed
 firdausi ne rustam or soharaab jaise paatr nirmit kiye hai jo maanav-smriti kaa hissaa ban chuke hai
 There is a beautiful garden around the tomb of Firdausi, as Iranians have done with their great poets
 idhar-udhar unki pratimaayein lagi hai
 Special episodes of his poetry are engraved on marble

 Sir Creek listen assistance · Information a tidal estuary measuring 96 kilometers on the border of India and Pakistan, it is bordering the Kutch district of Gujarat and Sindh in Pakistan
 yahan bharat or pakistan ke bich seemaa ko lekar vivaad he lekin yah vivaad kam hi charchaa me aata he
 The dispute is about the 96 km long estuary in the Rann of Kutch that separates India's Gujarat from Sindh province of Pakistan
 sar creek kii khadi kaa vivaad se purana rishta rahaa he
 After winning Sindh in 1842, the commander of the East India Company, Charles Napier, handed over the administration of that region to the state of Mumbai
 iske baad sindh me apana prashasan chalaa rahi angrez sarkaar ne sindh or mumbai praant ke bich ke seemaa rekha khinchi thi jo kuccha ke madhya se guzarati thi
 In this, the entire bay was shown in Sindh province
 yani ki kuccha ke mul pradesh se use alag kar sindh me jod diya gaya tha
 On the other hand, the British government of Delhi used to show the boundary line between Sindh and Kutch in its official map, after dragging it to the Rann of Kutch, near the state of the Gulf
 swatantraaa ke baad pakistan ne khadi ke pradesh par apana malikana haq jataayaa
 iske jawaab main bharat kaa prastaav tha ki kuccha ke ran se lekar khadi ke mukh tak kii ek sidhi rekha ko seemaa rekha maan lenaa chahie
 But this proposal was not accepted by Pakistan
 is prakaar se sir kii khadi kaa kareeb 650 varg kilometre kaa pradesh aaj bhi vivaadit pradesh he or is pradesh se pakistani rangeron dwaara bhartiya machuaaron ko uthaa le jane kii khabaren aati rahati he
 After Siachen, the head crick is another borderline which increases the tension between India and Pakistan

 barason ke adhyayan ke baad jab 1916 main albert oinstin ne is siddhant kii ghoshnaa kii to vigyaan kii duniya main tahalaka much gaya or dhai-sau saal se qaayam ijak newton dwaara 1687 main ghoshit brahmand kaa nazariyaa hameshaa ke liye ulat diya gaya
 It had such a profound effect on physics that people began to describe modern physics as a subject different from classical physics and Albert Einstein came to be considered the father of modern physics
 dik sanskrit kaa shabd he jiskaa arth he ird-gird kii jagah
 It is called "space" in English
 manushya dik ke teen pahaluon ko bhaap sakane kii kshamta rakhte hai- upar-neeche, aage-peeche or daayen-baayein
 In ordinary life, humans do not see any change in problems
 newton kii bhautikee kahati thi ki agar antariksh main do vastuen ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hai or un donon main se koi bhi na hile, to ve ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hi rahengi
 Our ordinary life also shows us this
 lekin inastin ne kaha ki aisa nahin he
 The problem may worsen and shrink
 aisa bhi sambhav he ki jo do vastuen ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hai ve swayan na hilen, lekin unke bich kaa dik kuch paristhitiyon ke kaaran fail kar sava kilometre ho jaae yaa sikud ke pauna kilometre ho jaae
 In Newton's classical physics, it was said that the speed of time is the same everywhere in the universe
 agar aap ek jagah tik kar baithe hai or aapkaa koi mitra prakaash se aadhi gati kii raftaar par das saal kaa safar tay kare to, us safar ke baad, aapke bhi das saal guzar chuke honge or aapke dost ke bhi
 But Einstein also said that this belief is wrong
 jab koi chiz gati se chalati he, uske liye samay dhire ho jaataa he or vah jitna tej chalati he, samay utana hi dhire ho jaataa he
 If your friend returned by traveling at half the speed of light for ten years according to his own, then ten years would have passed but eleven and a half years would have passed
 inastin ne saapekshata siddhant main dikhaaya ki vastav main dik ke teen or kaal kaa ek milakar brahmand main chaar pahaluon vaala dik-kaal he jisame sari vasteen or urjaayen sthit hotin hai
 This problem is not permanent - neither problem occurs without any change and it is not necessary that the flow of time is the same for every thing
 dik-kaal ko prabhavit kar ke use maroda, khinchaa or sikoda ja saktaa he or aisa hi brahmand main hota he
 The concept of time travel has been created through this principle
 dik-kaal main badlaav har vastu or har raftaar paidaa karti he lekin badi vasteen or prakaash ke sameep kii raftaarein adhik badlaav paidaa karti hai
 Humans are so small and their speed is so slow that they do not see the effects of the theory of relativity in their lives, but when they study more things in the universe, they find signs of relativity in many places
 jab vastu kaa veg prakaash ke veg kaa 5% bhi ho jaae, to saapekshata ke siddhanth ke chinh hame dikhaai dene lagate he
 Newton believed that every object had a force to pull towards itself, which he called gravity
 prithvi jaisi badi chiz main yah gurutvkarshan bahut adhik hota he, jisase ham prithvi se chipke rahete hai or anayas hi ud kar antariksh main nahin chale jate
 But Newton could not explain how the force of gravity actually works and why
 inastin ne kaha ki aapekshikta ke siddhanth ke anusaar yah vichaar ki bhautik vastuen ek doosar ko aakarshith karti hai, ek bhram he, jo prakruti sambandhi galat yantrik dharanaon ke kaaran paidaa hua he
 He said that the earth is large and because of that the time period around him has turned and folded over itself
 ham is khiche-mude dik-kaal main rahete hai or is mudan kii vajah se prithvi ke qareeb dhakele jate hai
 This can be compared to a sheet whose four corners have been pulled by four people
 ab is chadar ke bich main ek baari gola rakh diya jaae, to chadar bich se baith jaaegi, yani uske soot main bich main mudan paidaa ho jaaegi
 Now if we place a light ball on the corner of the sheet, it will roll towards the big circle
 inastin ne kaha ki koi anaadi aadmi yah dekh kar kah saktaa he ki choti gend ko bade gole ne khinchaa isliye gend uske paas gai
 But the real reason was that the ball wanted to go towards the ground and the shell created such a twist in the sheet that the ball went to him
 isi tarah se unhone kaha ki yah ek mithyaa he ki gurutvkarshan kisi aakarshan kii vajah se hota he
 The real reason for gravity is that every object which is moving in space, comes under the influence of such a problem of difficulty and starts moving towards something bigger
 vastut: gurutvkarshan jadta kaa ek bhaag maatr he, taare or grahon kii gatividhiyaan, unke swabhaavgat jadtv se utpann hotin hai or unka maarg dik-kaal-satati ke vrittiya tatwon par nirbhar karata he
 Just as there is a magnetic field around the magnet, the celestial object scatters a field in the sky around it
 jis tarah chumbakeey kshetra main ek lohe ke tukade kii gatividhi kshetra kii banaavat se nirdeshit hoti he usee tarah gurutveey kshetra main kisi vastu kaa maarg us kshetra kii jyamithik avasthaa se nirdhaarit hota he
 Einstein's law of gravitation gives information about the regional elements of the time constant
 mukhyat: is niyam kaa ek bhaag gurutvkarshanjanya vastu ke chaaron ore ke kshetra ke dhaanche se sambandh vyakt karata he
 a great proof of Einstein's spreading theory came from seeing the effect of gravity on light
 newton kii bhautikee main siddhant tha ki do vasteen ek-duusare ko donon ke dravyaman ke anusaar khinchati hai
 But there is no mass of light, that is, zero
 to newton ke mutabiq jis chiz kaa koi dravyaman yaa vazan hi nahin uskaa kisi duusari vastu ke gurutvkarshan se khichne kaa sawaal hi nahin banataa chaahe duusari vastu kitni bhi badi kyon na ho
 Light always moves in a straight line
 lekin agar inastin sahi he or kisi badi vastu kii vajah se dik hi mud jaae, to roshni bhi dik ke mudane ke saath mud jaani chahie
 That is, large objects located in the universe should act as lenses - just as the lens of glasses, binoculars or microscope turns light, the stars and planets should also bend
 1924 main ek orest khwolson naam ke roosi bhautikavigyaani ne inastin ke saapekshata siddhant ko samajhakar bhavishyavaanee kii ki aise gurutvkarshak lens brahmand main zarur honge
 Fifty-five years later, this was first noticed in 1979 when two images were seen, instead of one, of an object called twin quasars
 uske baad kaafii dur-daraaj vastuon kii aisi chhaviyaan dekhi ja chuki hai jinamein un vastuon or prithvi ke bich koi bahut badi anya vastu rakhi ho jo pehali vastu se aa rahi prakaash kii kirnon par lenson kaa kaam kare or uski chhavi ko yaa to marod de yaa aasmaan main uski ek se zyaada chhavi dikhaae

 kabhi-kabhi ise 'tarabhautikee' bhi kah diya jaataa he haalaanki vah khagolbhautikee kii ek pramukh shakha he jisamen taron kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Inspired by a keen desire to understand the mysteries of nature, man started studying celestial pandas
 usne inke vishay main jitani soochna keval netron kii sahaayta se praapt kii ja sakati thi praapt kii; udhaahrant:, vah prithvi kii dainik tathaa vaarshik gatiyon or unase sambhddha bhautik ghatnaon, chandramaa kii kalaon tathaa chandra maas, grahon kii gatiyon aadi ko samajhane laga
 But as long as the sun, moon and planets were considered to be images and stars, light could not be known about them
 italy ke jyotishi gallilyon gallily ne san 1612 main akashamandal ke adhyayan main pehali baar doordarshee kaa prayog kiya; kintu jab tak doordarshee kii rachana main samuchit unnati nahin hui, iske upyog se bhi grahprishthon ke adhyayan ke atirikt koi or vishesh mahatvapurn soochna na praapt kii ja saki
 As the design of the telescope continued to improve, its utility in astrological research increased, but astronomy began in the second quarter of the 19th century, when the German physicist, Gustaf Robert Kirkhhoff, in the study of the sun and other starlight, The principles of spectrography propounded by is saadhan ke vikaas main photography se atyant sahaayta mili, kyonki isaki sahaayta se aalokit varncrampatt sthaayee rup se tulanaatmak adhyayan ke liye uplabdh hone lage
 The same photometry and means of measuring the intensity of the spectral lines provided invaluable information about the physical state of celestial bodies, aiding in the study of spectrometry
 jab koi gas jalaai jaati he tab, kirkhhof ke siddhant ke anusaar, vah shwet prakaash kaa vikiran na karke keval vishesh varnon ke prakaash kaa hi vikiran karti he
 These characters are called characteristic characters of gas
 in varnon main koun koun se varna prakat honge, yah us bhautik avasthaa main sthit deeptiman gas main se yadi shwet prakaash gaman kare, to shwet prakaash kaa varnakram santat nahin hota, varan usamen gas ke lakshanik varna anupasthit hote hai
 Additionally, if the temperature of the origin of white light is higher than the temperature of the gas, black lines, called Fraunhofer lines, appear in place of the characteristic characters of the gas in the spectroscope
 in kaali rekhaon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki shwet prakaash kis kis gas main gaman karke varnakramdarshi tak pahunchaa he tathaa uske gas parmaanu kis bhautik avasthaa main hai
 Kirkhoff proposed this theory based on experiments
 parantu aage chalakar parmanurachana ke gyaan or kwantum siddhant kii sahaayta se varnakramiki ke niyamon kaa pratipaadan saidhantik rup se kiya ja sakaa
 It is clear from the above statement that there is a natural limit to the utility of spectral means in the study of astrophysics
 yah isliye ki varnakramdarshi padaarth kii bhautik avasthaa ke vishay main tabhi soochna de saktaa he jab yah padaarth deeptiman gas ke rup main ho
 Therefore, by this means it will not be able to know what substances are located in the path of light and what is their physical state
 khagoleey pindon se jo prakaash aata he vah uske aantarik bhaagon main utpann hota he, phir bhi un bhaagon kii rachana ke vishay main varnakramdarshi kii sahaayta se kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 He is only able to give information about the gas circle that surrounds these bodies
 falat: in pindon ke aantarik bhaagon kii rachana tathaa bhautik avasthaa ke vishay main jaanane ke liye varnakramiki se bhinn sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he
 These tools will be described further
 agyayan ke sadhano ke vichaar se tarapind ko do mukhya bhaagon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he: aantarik bhaag or gasmandal Based on the study of the spectrum, many facts have been known about stars, the main of which is the following: surya tathaa anya taare deeptiman gas ke vishaal goleey pind hai, jinke aantarik bhaagon ke prishth kaa taap, jise prishthiya kehete hai, sahasron anshon tak hota he
 As the stars move towards the center of the star, the temperature increases; Even the central temperature is found to be several hundred thousand
 ? The interior of each star is surrounded by a gasosphere
 in gasmandalon main jo tatv pahachaane gaye he ve sab prithvi par bhi paae jate hai
 This does not mean that there will be no other elements here than those found on earth
 vastav main taron ke varnakram main aisi fronhophar rekhaayen pai jaati hai jo prithvi par paae janevaale kisi bhi tatv kii rekhaon se bhinn hai
 Hydrogen, helium, carbon, iron, etc
 are mainly present in the gas system of stars
 bhartiya jyotishi, meghnad saaha, ne san 1922 main apane prasiddh ooshmpyanan sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya, jisaki sahaayta se varnakram pattee kaa vaastavik tathy samajha ja saktaa he
 The Saha Sutra, after the visionary, is the most important invention in astrology, in the words of the famous British astrologer Eddington
 taare ke satat varnakram ke adhyayan se uskaa prabhavi taap nishchit kiya jaataa he
 In the exploration it is imagined that Tara is an ideal Krishna body, which means that its surface is organized in such a way that it completely absorbs all the radiation that falls on it
 kirkhhof or bailphor or stuart ne yah siddh kiya he ki yadi pind kii urja main parivartan na ho, to prayek varna main uske vikiran or avasorana kii matraayen ek vishesh anupaat main hoti hai
 The word Krishna has no relation to the visible color of the body
 aise pind ke saidhantik, athwa prayogtmak, adhyayan ne yah siddh kiya he ki vishesh taap par prayek varna kii tivrata nishchit hoti he
 Planck has formulated a formula based on thermodynamics, which suggests that in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, there is a certain intensity of radiation of a character of the ideal Krishna body
 upar diya rekhachitr tarangadaidhray or vikiran kii tivrata main sambandh bataata he
 For a given temperature of the body, the limited area between the axis of the curve and the wavelength determines the total energy that the radiating star is emitting every moment in the sky
 in vakron se yah bhi spasht he ki pind ke taap main parivartan ke saath hi saath mahattam tivrata ke tarangadaidhray main bhi parivartan ho jaataa he
 In fact, as the temperature of the body increases, the wavelength of greatest intensity decreases, that is, it moves towards the visible part in the spectrum
 adarsh krishna pind ke liye plank niyam ke anusaar taap or mahattam tivrata ke tarangadaidhray ke sambandh ko prakat karanevaala sutara saralata se gyaat kar liya jaataa he
 Therefore, to determine the effective temperature of the star, firstly by studying its spectrum, the wavelength of radiation of greatest intensity is found
 taare kaa prabhavi taap vastav main us adarsh krishna pind kaa taap he jiske vikiran kii mahattam tivrata usee tarangadaidhray main he jisamen taare kii
 There is a large variation in the spectral text of the strings, but even if the main focus is on the main Fraunhofer lines, these spectra sheets can be divided into a few sections
 gat shatabdi main anek jyotishiyon ne taron kaa varnakram ke vichaar se vargeekaran karne kaa praytn kiya, parantu prachlit vargeekaran vartmaan shatabdi ke pratham varsho main harvard veghashaala main professor mikaring, shrimati faleming tathaa kumari kenon dwaara kiya gaya tha
 Some letters have been used in this classification, which have no special scientific basis except for convenience
 is vargeekaran ke mukhya varg o, ba, e, pha, ga, k tathaa m se chihnit kiye jate hai suvidha ke liye inamen se prayek varg das upvargon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In practice, the square of a star is determined based on the intensity of the major absorption lines in its spectrum, which depend on both temperature and pressure
 at: vargeekaran main taap evam daab kaa prabhaav is prakaar vichaar me liya jaataa he ki adhikansh taare do mukhya shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja saken : vishaal taare or vaaman taare or tab prayek shrenee main avasorana rekhaon kii tivrataayen itane niyamanusaar badalati hai ki di hui tivrataon ke liye taare ke varg kaa, falat: uske prabhavi taap kaa, nishchay anany rup se kiya ja saktaa he
 The temperature of a large star of a given square is less than the temperature of the star of the same class
 surya vaaman shrenee kaa sadsy he
 The following table gives the characteristics of effective heat and spectrum for the Vamana series wires corresponding to these classes: aage chalakar avishisht awalokit taron ko vargeekaran main sammilit karne ke liye is vargeekaran ke prarambh main varg va or ant main na, r tathaa sa virgon kaa yoga kar diya falat: prachlit vargeekaran is prakaar he: The spectral instrument also revealed that many stars, which appear alone in photographs taken by the greatest telescopes, are actually two stars, which revolve around their center of gravity
 in taron ko varnakramdarsheey yugmak taare kehete hai
 The spectral lines of radiant gas located in a magnetic field are much wider than the radiated lines in the normal state and are broken up into two and sometimes more sublines
 ise jeman prabhaav kehete hai
 Babcock found this effect to exist in the spectroscopes of some stars, on the basis of which he concluded that these stars had magnetic fields similar to the Sun
 taron ke bich ke sthaan main sampurna rup se padaarth kaa abhaav nahin he
 There is very diffused dust and corpuscles present there
 udaahranarth, akashganga main surya ke sameep prati ghan senmi0 main madhyat: ek hydrogen parmaanu prati ghan senmi0 or prati ghan kimi0 main 10-5 senmi0 ardhavyas ke lagbhag 25 pindkhand paae jate hai
 Thus the density of the substance located in this place is about 3-10-24 grams per cubic cm
 taron ke gasmandal main bhi padaarth kaa ghanatav lagbhag itnaa hi hota he
 This statement is not true about other parts of the galaxy
 ab yah nishchit rup se gyaat he ki prayek niharika ke bhinn bhinn bhaagon main ghanatv bhinn he
 The tendency of matter within the star is found to be present as dense clouds of gas
 in meghon kaa punj taron ke punj or kabhi kabhi vishaal taramandal ke punj, ke samaan hota he
 This cloud not only absorbs the light of the stars behind it, but also scatter it, due to which the light of the star starts to feel like blood color; For example, the molecules of the Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight at dusk and give blood to the Sun
 is prakirnan kii maatra ke adhyayan se hi taare ke bheetar ke padaarth main vidyaman pindkhandon ke madhyapariman kaa nishchay kiya jaataa he
 As already written, there is no physical means of knowing the internal composition of the stars
 at: is sanghatan kaa adhyayan karne ke liye ganitiya sadhano kaa upyog karnaa padataa he
 a simple model of the inner part of the star, conceived of the observed material and the physical principles, is imagined and then the physical goals of this model are determined in the manner of mathematics
 yadi ye lakshan taron ke aalokit lakshanon ke samaan hon, to yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki taare ke aantarik bhaag main bhi waisi hi bhautik avasthaaen vidyaman hai jaisi praturup main
 How many such models have been studied
 iske falswaroop taron ke aantarik bhaag ke sanghatan ke vishay main samuchit gyaan praapt kiya ja sakaa hai
 Some types of star mass and their radius are known
 iske atirikt prayek taare kaa yah aavashyak lakshan he ki vah satat akaash main sab ore urja kaa vikiran karata rahata he
 The rate of radiation of energy, which is called the star's light, is as important as the star's mass and radius
 yadi taron ke punj or unte ardhvyaason kaa rekhachitr khinchaa jaae, to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki taare lagbhag teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai
 The drawing of stars and astrologers also supports this statement
 adhikansh taron ke liye unki jyoti punj ke lagbhag 3
5 ghaat ke anusaar vicharan karti he
 The group of these stars is called the main category
 jo taare is shrenee se bhinn hai, ve do prakaar ke hote hai : shwet vaaman or trumpler taare
 The light of the trumpler stars varies in proportion to their mass
 yadi ek hi punj kii mukhya shrenee ke taron or shwet-vaaman kii jyotiyon ore ardhvyaason kii tulana karen, to yah paaya jaataa he ki shwet vathan mukhya shrenee ke taare kii apeksha bahut kam jyetishman hota he or uskaa ardhavyas bhi bahut kam hota he
 Therefore, the substance of white vamana should be very dense
 dwitiya-lubdhak shwet-vaaman shrenee kaa pratinidhi mana jaataa he
 Its mean density is about 6
8 j 104 grams per cubic cm
 yahi yaheen, yadi ek hi prabhavi taap ke mukhya shrenee ke taron or shwet vaaman kii jyotiyon kii tulana karen, to shwet vaaman mukhya shrenee ke taare kii apeksha bahut hi kam jyetishmaan hota he
 These variations are indicative of differences in the internal composition of the stars
 treta yug main bhagwaan parashuram nen sahatrarjun ko markar kshatriyon ke vansh ko mitaayaa
 At that time, some Kshatriyas and Kshatranis had protected themselves by running to the forest and mountain
 unamem se chandrasen raja kii rani garbhavastha main thim
 She ran to Bagdalia Muni's hut
 muni nen stri ko dukhi va anaath dekhakar sharan di
 When Parshuram ji got the news of this, he reached Bagdalia Muni, Bagdalia Muni came to see Lord Parshuram ji
 Requested to be given bagadalia muni kaa adarbhav dekh bhagwaan parashuram ji ne bhojan grahan kiya or bhojanoparant bhagwaan parashuram ji bole aapaki kutiyaa main chandrasen raja kii rani garbh sahit ai he use mujhe soup dijie jisase mai use garbh sahit mitaa sakuun
 Bagdalia Muni agreed to give them
 tab bhagwaan parashuram ji bagadalia muni par khush hokar unase ek manorath maghanen ko kaha tab bagadalia muni nen kaha ki aap usee stri kaa garbh hamen de dijie
 Lord Parashuram ji, hearing this, laughed and accepted to return the woman
 bagadalia muni nen tab us stri se bhagwaan parashuram ji ke charan camel ko pranaam karavaaya
 Parshuram was pleased and told Bagdalia Muni that you know that i am well-versed in destroying the Kshatriyas but i have asked for this woman's womb, so now i will not kill it, but no Kshatriya can survive me For this reason, when the pregnancy of this woman is over, this child will be given the dynasty of Chitragupta and give it Kayastha religion

 Tikkann was a poet
 ve kavitrayee main se ek the jinhone shatabdiyon main mahabharat kaa telegu main anuwaad kiya
 Tikkan came after two centuries of the poet Nannay
 ve nellurimandal ke raja manum siddh ke mantri the
 The ministers Komann and Annamamba were the mother of Tikkann
 pita bhi 'gunterivibh' the arthath tikkann sampann tathaa panditvansh main utpann hue the
 His grandfather Bhaskar was also a poet
 tikkann ke samay main shaiva tathaa vaishnav donon dharm joro se prachaarit the or donon main sangharsh bhi khub chal rahaa tha
 Followers of these religions were also opposed to mutual philosophy and speech
 aisi paristhiti ko dekhakar jo hariharaatmak devtaa kii bhaavana nikali isi ko ishtdev maanakar tikkann bhi in dharmo ke samrasya ke liye katibaddh hue
 Not only a minister of Tikkann Manusiddha, he was also a respected poet
 arugallu ke raja ganapatidev ke saath manumasiddhi kaa jo bhedbhaav utpann hua usamen mantri kii haisiyat se tikkann ke donon raajaaon ko yuddhrat hone se bachaaya
 Being a well-known politician, he reinvented Sri Krishna's legacy smoothly
 tikkann kii pehali rachana 'nirvachanottar ramayana' raja manumasiddh ko hi samarpit thi
 Verses are found only in interpretive texts, not the parts of prose that signify champu
 yadhyapi yah granth shrimadramayana ke uttarkand kaa anuwaad rup hi he, tikkann ne kai anshon main swatantraaa kaa avlamban kiya
 The second composition of Tikkann is Andhra Mahabharata, while Somayag, he also became the title of Somayaji
 aranyaparv ke ananudit ansh ko na lekar tikkann ne viraatparv se aarambh karke ant tak pandrah parvon kaa andhrikaran kiya or is kaary main nannay kaa hi margnusaran kiya
 He demonstrated great skill in portraying characters and nurturing juices
 swayan mantri hone ke kaaran raajnneeti, yudhvarnan aadi main inaki rachana main gambhirtha or sahajata prasphutit hoti he
 The style of Tikkann is primarily the dialogue style in which narrative is preformed by the characters' dialogues
 nannay kii tarah dirdh samaason ke paksh main ye nahin the
 He used two-thirds Telugu words and the remaining Sanskrit phrase
 clisht tathaa aadhyatmik vishay bhi deshi bhashaa dwaara suvyakt kiye ja sakate hai, yah baat tikkann kii rachana se pramanit ho jaati he
 He also got the title of 'ubhay Kavimitra' due to the adoption of 'marg' and indigenous methods
 lokoktiyaan or muhaavarey bhi inaki rachana main kaaphi milte hai
 Tikkanna dedicated his scripture to Harihardeva, who symbolizes the inseparability of Shiva and Keshava, and for this reason Tikkann is also counted as the promoter of religious unity
 padlaalitya, arthgaurav, kalpana evam tark sangatta aadi gun jo tikkan kii rachana main paae jate hai ve sabhi kisi ek kavi kii rachana main durlabh hai
 Ketkan, a disciple of Tikkanna, also became a poet, who dedicated his verse to the Padyakavya guru named Daskumar Charit
 khandakavy sahitya main prabandh kavy kaa ek rup he
 Poetry is a poem written about a particular event in life
 "khand kavy' shabd se hi spasht hota he ki isamen maanav jivan kii kisi ek hi ghatana kii pradhanta rahati he
 In which the life of the charred hero does not affect the poet in its entirety
 kavi charit nayak ke jivan kii kisi sarvotkrisht ghatana se prabhavit hokar jivan ke us khand vishesh kaa apane kavy main purnataya udghaatan karata he
 Managerialism remains both in the epic and in the Khanda poetry, but in the Khasasutra of the Khanda Kavya, there is no diversity of life
 isliye iskaa kathanak kahani kii bhanti shighratapurvak ant kii ore jaataa he
 Along with the epic lead story, many other relevant episodes are also connected, so its plot, like the novel, gradually leads to Falagam
 khandakavy main keval ek pramukh katha rahati he, praasangik kathaon ko isamen sthaan nahin milane paata he
 The only definition of this in Sanskrit literature is available in Sahitya Darpan as follows- is paribhaasha ke anusaar kisi bhashaa yaa upbhasha main sargabaddh evam ek katha kaa nirupak aisa padyatmak granth jisamen sabhi sandhiyaan na hon vah khandakavy he
 He follows only a fraction of the epic
 tadnusaar hindi ke katipay acharya khandakavy aise kavy ko maanate hai jisaki rachana to mahakavy ke dhang par kii gai ho par usamen samgr jivan na grahan kar keval uskaa khand vishesh hi grahan kiya gaya ho
 That is, in the Khandakavya, a block life is expressed in such a way that it seems to be automatic in the form of presentation
 vastut: khandakavy ek aisa padhyabaddh kavy he jiske kathanak main ekaatmak anviti ho; katha main ekangita ho tathaa kathavinyas kram main aarambh, vikaas, charam seemaa or nishchit uddeshy main parinti ho or vah aakaar main laghu ho
 As a criterion of brevity, the management of less than eight cantos is considered a fragment

 Before leaving the family, the Buddha's name was Crown Prince Siddhartha Gautama
 is pustak main, buddha ko “gautam” kaha gaya he
 It begins with a Brahmin son Siddhartha
 vah sanyas grahan karne ke liye apane saathi govind ke saath grih tyaag detaa he
 They both set out in search of knowledge
 siddharth vyapaaree ke rup main premi ke saath saadhutv se atyadhik duniyavi jivan kii taraf jate hai or phir sanyas kii taraf waapas aate hai kyonki vah yahi lakshya praapt karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 This story dates back to the time of Gautama Buddha in ancient India
 anubhav un sachet ghatnaon kaa nichod he, jinka ek vyakti apane jivan main anubhav karata he – yah bhagidaari karnaa, siikhnaa or gyaan praapt karne kii ore sanket karata he
 Understanding is the power and inclusion of understanding
 hes ke upanyaas siddharth main, anubhav ko vaastaviktaa kii samaj or gyaan praapt karne ke sabase uttam saadhan ke rup main darshaya gaya he – siddharth kii yatra main hes kii rachanaatmakataa yah darshaati he ki samaj ko vidyalayan, buddhi aadhaarit tareekon ke madhyam se praapt nahin kiya jaataa, na hi koi duniya main shaareerik sukhon kaa bhoga karte hue or sansar kii pidaaon ko saath rakhkar samaj praapt kar saktaa he; haalanki yah un anubhavon kii samshti he, jisane siddharth ko samaj praapt karne kii anumati di
 Therefore, single tasks are meaningless when they are considered by themselves - Siddharth's stay with Shramana and his sinking into the world of love and vocation do not lead to nirvana, yet they cannot be considered distraction, every act that Siddhartha Took responsibility and the incident which happened to Siddharth helped him to gain understanding
 Experience has been formed by meeting these events
 udhaaharan ke liye, siddharth kaa apane putr ke liye bhavuk or dukh bharaa prem vah anubhav he jisane unhen samanubhuti sikhaai; is anubhav ke baad ve balak ke samaan vyaktiyon ko samajhane main sakasham hue
 pehle, yadhyapi ve sansar main dub chuke the, kintu ve balak samaan vyaktiyon ke abhiprerana or jivan ko samavisht nahin kar pate the
 And while the world held him, weakening him and he was his primal, he was unable to understand the nature of the world
 is bindu par sansar ke anubhav ne samaj kii ore agrasar nahin kiya; sambhawatah isse unhen baadha pahunchi
 isaki tulana main, siddharth ke apane putr ke saath anubhav ne unhen prem karne kii anumati di, aisa kuch jo vah pehle nahin kar paae the; ek baar phir prem ne swayan unhen samaj kii ore agrasar nahin kiya
 The novel ends with Siddharth becoming a boatman, learning from the river and adopting peace and capturing the essence of his journey: siddharth ko likhane main hes kii mukhya chintaa swayan ko bhartiya falsafe main dhaal kar apane ‘jivan ke rog’ se mukti paanaa tha jaisaa upanishdon or bhagwad gita main bataaya gaya he
 The reason for writing the second part of the book too long was that Hess "could not experience the abstruse state of integrity that Siddhartha aspired to"
 In an effort to do so, Hess lived as a true semi-recluse and was completely immersed in the sacred teachings of both Hindu and Buddhist scriptures
 unki abhilaashaa vah ‘purnataa’ praapt karne kii thi, jo upanyaas main, buddha ko sabase alag banaati he
 "this novel is written on the three mythological stages of life of Hindu men, the householder and the Bairagi / renunciation) and the four great truths of the Buddha and the eight-turning path consisting of twelve chapters
 ralf freedman varnan karte hai ki hes ne kaise ek shabd main tippanee kii ki "meraa siddharth, ant main, sachcha vivek kisi shikshak se nahin sikhta balki nadi se sikhta he, jo mazedaar tareeke se kalakal karti bahati he or ek dayaalu buudhe murkh vyakti se sikhta he jo hameshaa muskuraataa he or vastav main vah ek sant hota he
 "in a lecture about Siddhartha, Hess claimed that" the Buddha's path to salvation was often criticized and doubted, as it was considered completely logical in cognition
 It is correct, but it is only intellectual There is no cognition, not just learning and knowing but spiritual experience that can only be attained through rigorous discipline in a selfless life

 The Shakyas had their own union
 bees varsh kii aayu hone par har shakya tarun ko shakyasang main dikshit hokar sangh kaa sadsy bananaa hota tha
 When Siddhartha Gautam was twenty years old, he too joined the membership of Shakyasangh and according to the rules of Shakya Sangha, Siddhartha had spent eight years as a member of Shakya Sangha
 ve sangh ke atyant samarpit or pakke sadsy the
 He was very interested in the affairs of the Union
 sangh ke sadsy ke rup main unka aacharan ek udhaaharan tha or unhone swayan ko sabakaa priy bana liya tha
 In the eighth year of the membership of the Sangh, an incident occurred which became tragic for Shuddhodan's family and a critical situation was created in the life of Siddhartha
 shaakyon ke rajya kii seemaa se sata hua coliyon kaa rajya tha
 The Rohini River was the dividing line of the two states
 shakya or coliya donon hi rohinee nadi ke pani se apane-apane khet sinchate the
 They used to dispute between each crop on who would use Rohini's water first and how much
 ye vivaad kabhi-kabhi jhagade or ladaaiyon main badal jate the
 When Siddhartha was 28 years old, there was a fight between Shakya and the servants of Kolis over Rohini's water, injuring people on both sides
 jhagade kaa pataa chalane par shaakyon or coliyon ne sochaa ki kyon na is vivaad ko yuddh dwaara hameshaa ke liye hal kar liya jaye
 The commander of the Sakyas called a session of the Shakya Sangha to consider the question of declaration of war against the Kolis and proposed war to the Union
 siddharth gautam ne is prastaav kaa virodh kiya or kaha yuddh kisi prashn kaa samaadhaan nahin hota, yuddh se kisi uddeshy kii purti nahin hogi, isse ek duusare yuddh kaa bijaropan hoga
 Siddharth said that i propose that we choose two men from among us and ask the Kolis to choose two men
 phir ye chaaron milakar ek paanchavaa aadmi chune
 These five men together solve the quarrel
 siddharth kaa prastaav bahumat se amaanya ho gaya saath hi shakya senapati kaa yuddh kaa prastaav baari bahumat se paarit ho gaya
 Unable to resolve the dispute with Shakya Sangha and Shakya Senapati, Siddharth eventually had three options

 Even in this work, he became more proficient than his teachers, but he could not find answers to his questions yet
 fir unhone kuch saathi ikaithe kiye or chal diye adhik kathor tapasya karne
 Doing so, after six years, without getting answers to their questions, having passed through death due to hunger, they started thinking of doing something else
 is samay, unhen apane bachapan kaa ek pal yaad aayaa, jab unke pita khet taiyaar karnaa shuru kar rahe the
 At that time, he had fallen into a blissful meditation and he felt as if time had come to a standstill
 kathor tapasya chhodkar unhone ashtangik maarg dhund nikaala, jo bich kaa maarg bhi kehalaata jaataa he kyonki yah maarg dono tapasya or asanyam kii paraakaashthaon ke bich main he

 For the rest of his 45 years, Gautama Buddha gave his sermon around the river Ganges, to both the rich and the poor
 unhone do sanyaasiyon ke sangh kii bhi sthapana jinhone buddha ke dharmopadesh ko failaana jari rakhaa

 There is sorrow in birth, in old age, in sickness, in death, in getting away from loved ones, in things with dislike, in not getting desire, in everything

 Template: Main: Octagonal route buddha dharm ke anusaar, chauthe arya satya kaa arya ashtaang maarg he dukh nirodh paane kaa rasta
 Gautama Buddha used to say that to follow the truth of the Four Noble Truths, one should follow this path: 1
 samyak drushti : chaar arya satya main vishwaas karnaa 2
 samyak sankalp : maansik or naitik vikaas kii pratigya karnaa 3
 samyak vaak : hanikaarak baaten or jhut na bolnaa 4
 samyak karm : hanikaarak karmon ko na karnaa 5
 samyak jeevika : koi bhi pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se hanikaarak vyapaar na karnaa 6
 samyak prayaas : apane aap sudharne kii koshish karnaa 7
 samyak smriti : spasht gyaan se dekhne kii maansik yogyata paane kii koshish karnaa 8
 samyak samadhi : nirvana paanaa or swayan kaa gaayab hona Some people consider the Arya Ashtanga Marg as a path, in which to move forward, it is necessary to attain the level of the previous
 or logon ko lagata he ki is maarg ke str sab saath-saath paae jate he
 The route is classified into three parts: Pragya, Sheel and Samadhi
 bhagwaan buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko paanch shilo kaa paalan karne kii shiksha di hai

 The knowledge found from Gautama Buddha is called Bodhi
 mana jaataa he ki bodhi paane ke baad hi sansar se chhutkaaraa paaya ja saktaa he
 Bodhi can be attained only by the perfection of all the parameters, the complete understanding of the four Aryan truths and the prevention of karma
 is samay, lobh, dosha, moh, avidya, trishna or atmaa main vishwaas sab gaayab ho jate he
 There are three levels of Bodhi: ावकravakodhodhi, each Bodhādhi and Samyakasobodhi
 samyaksambodhi bodh dharm kii sabase unnat adarsh maani jaati he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 sabhi buddha sampradaay tathagat buddha ke mul siddhant hi maanate hai
 The theory of pratyatamutpad states that any event exists in a complex cause-and-consequence web only because of other events
 praaniyon ke liye, iskaa arth he karm or vipaak ke anusaar anant sansar kaa chakra
 Because everything is eternal and eternal, nothing really exists
 har ghatana multah shunaya hoti he
 However, humans, who have the power of knowledge, can attain nirvana by abandoning Trishna, which is the cause of sorrow, turning the power destroyed in Trishna into knowledge and meditation
 is duniya main sab kuch kshanik he or nashwar he
 Nothing permanent
 parantu vaidic mat se virodh he
 The soul means 'I'
 kintu, praani sharir or man se bane he, jisame sthayitv nahi he
 There is a moment-to-moment change
 isliye, 'mai'arthath aatma naam kii koi sthaayee chiz nahin
 What people consider to be a soul is an uninterrupted flow of consciousness
 aatma kaa sthaan man ne liya he
 Buddha has told how the creation of the universe in brahma-jala Sutra
 sristi kaa nirmaan hona or nasht hona baar-baar hota he
 Ishwara or Mahabrahma does not create the universe because the world operates on the rule of Pratyatmasutpad i
e
 the working-sense
 bhagwaan buddha ke anusaar, manushyon ke du:kha or sukh ke liye karm jimmedaar he, ishwar yaa mahabrahma nahi
 But elsewhere Buddha has called the supreme truth indescribable
 shoonyata mahayan buddha sampradaay kaa pradhan darshan he
 He values people of his own sect
 buddha dharm kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he
 Grief does not mean pessimism, but relativism and realism
 buddha, dhamm or sangh buddha dharm ke teen triratne hai
 There are four components of the union of monk, nun, upasaka and upasika
 das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karne vaala bodhisattva kehalaata he
 The Bodhisattvas are called "buddha" when they attain the ten forces or lands
 buddha bananaa hi bodhisattva ke jivan kii paraakaashtha he
 This identity is named Bodhi
 kaha jaataa he ki buddha shakyamuni keval ek buddha hai - unke pehle bahut saare the or bhavishya main or honge
 He said that anyone can become a Buddha if he attains the Bodhisattva by following the ten Paramitas in full and attains the ten forces or lands after the Bodhisattva
 buddha dharm kaa antim lakshya he sampoorn maanav samaaj se dukh kaa ant
 "I teach only one substance - there is sorrow, there is a cause of sorrow, there is a cure for sorrow, and there is a way to restrain sorrow"
 buddha dharm ke anuyaayi ashtangik maarg par chalakar na ke anusaar jikar agyanta or dukh se mukti or nirvana paane kii koshish karte hai
 The Sangh occupies a large place in Buddhism
 is dharm main buddha, dhamm or sangh ko 'triratn' kaha jaataa he
 Regarding the rule of union, Gautama Buddha said that small rules can make monks change
 un ke mahaparinirvana pashchaat sangh kaa aakaar main vyapak vruddhi hua
 After this growth, different people became attached to Buddha religion on the basis of different region, culture, social stage, initiation, etc
 and the rule of the Sangh started changing gradually
 saath hi main angutar nikaay ke kalam sutt main buddha ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par dharm paalan karne kii swatantrata di he
 Therefore, due to scandal / change in the law of Vinaya, local cultural / linguistic aspect, freedom of individual religion, more or less added to the definite side of religion, due to various reasons, various sects and associations in Buddha religion were scrapped
 vartmaan main, in sangh main pramukh sampradaay yaa panth therwaad, mahayan or vajrayan he
 There is a Navyaan sect of Buddhism in India which is perfectly pure, humanist and scientific
 saanchaa:main:therwaad Template: Main: Mahayana saanchaa:main:vajrayan Template: Main: Navayan bhagwaan buddha ke anuyaayion ke liye vishwa bhar main paanch mukhya tirth mukhya maane jate hai : This place is 25 km from Nautanwan railway station in the Terai of Nepal and about 12 km from Naugarh station on gorakhpur-gonda line
