hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi 
 Later Hinduism saw new goddesses - Ganesh, Rama, Krishna, Hanuman, Kartikeya, surya-chandra and planets and goddesses like - Durga, Parvati, Lakshmi, Sheetla, Sita, Kali, etc

 It is believed that the cow has a total of 33 Koti Devi gods
 hindu dharm manyataon main paanch pramukh devtaa poojaneey he
 These are different forms and powers of one God

 According to mythological beliefs, he was the son of Maharishi Angira
 bhagwaan shiv ke kathin tap se unhone devguru kaa pad paaya
 He protected the gods with his knowledge and mantra powers
 shiv krupa se ye guru grah ke rup main bhi poojaneey hai
 Thursday is the special day of worship of Guru Brihaspati Dev
 daanvon ke guru shukracharya maane jate hai
 His father was Maharishi Bhrigu, son of Brahmadev
 shukracharya ne hi shiv kii kathor tapasya kar mrit sanjivani vidya praapt kii, jisase vah mrit sharir main phir se praan phoonk dete the
 By the grace of Brahmadev, he is revered as the planet Venus
 shuukravaar shukr dev kii upasna kaa hi vishesh din he
 According to Hinduism, every conscious creature has an immaterial soul, which is eternal, latent, irrational and devoid of disorder
 hindu dharm ke mutabik manushya main hi nahin, balki har pashu or ped-paudhe, yani ki har jeev main aatma hoti he
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the characteristics of the soul are described by Lord Krishna as follows: kisi bhi janm main apni azaadi se kiye gayi karmon ke mutabik aatma aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 In the cycle of birth and death, the soul occupies itself as the next body without being insulted
 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he
 The worldly cycle of birth and death ends only when the person gets salvation
 uske baad aatma apane vaastavik sat-chit-anand swabhaav ko sadaa ke liye paa leti he
 The human vagina is the only birth in which a person's deeds, sins and virtuous give fruit, and the attainment of salvation through action is possible
 aatma or punarjanm ke prati yahi dharanaayen buddha dharm or sikh dharm kaa bhi aadhaar he
 The sacred texts of Hinduism are divided into two parts - Shruti and Smriti
 shruti hindu dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, jo purnat: aparivartaneey hai, arthath kisi bhi yug main iname koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation
 vedon ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed
 is
 agar shruti or smriti main koi vivaad hota he to shruti hi maanya hogi
 Except Shruti, all other Hindu scriptures are called Smriti, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi smriti granth vedon kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard than the Vedas, but are easier to read and are read by most Hindus
 pramukh smriti granth hai:- itihaas--ramayana or mahabharat, bhagavad gita, puraana--, manusmriti, dharamshastra or dharmasutra, aagam shaastra
 There are 6 major parts of Indian philosophy - Sankhya philosophy, Yoga, justice, Vaiseshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta
 hindu dharmagranthon ke mutabik devtaa dharm ke to daanav adharm ke pratik hai
 But do you know that in mythological beliefs, the gods and goddesses are said to be the children of the same father, but different mothers
 iske mutabik dev-daanvon ke pita rishi kashyap hai
 At the same time, the name of the mother of the gods is Aditi and the name of the mother of the demons is Diti
 vishwa main adhiktam hindu jansankhya vaale 20 raashtra In ancient times the Aryans worshiped many deities with Vedic mantras and agni-yajna
 arya devataaon kii koi murti yaa mandir nahin banaate the
 The major Aryan deities were: Devaraja Indra, Agni, Soma and Varuna
 unke liye vaidic mantra padhe jate the or agni main ghi, doodh, dahi, jau, ityagi kii aahuti di jaati thi
 Prajapati Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are rarely mentioned at that time
 bharat ek vishaal desh he, lekin uski vishalata or mahanata ko ham tab tak nahin jaan sakate, jab tak ki use dekhen nahin
 This way many great men got attention, but twelve hundred years ago today, Adiguru Shankaracharya did a very important work for it
 unhonen chaaron dishaao main bharat ke chhoron par, chaar peeth sthapit uttar main badrinath ke nikat jyotipeeth, dakshin main rameshwaram ke nikat shringery peeth, purv main jagannathpuri main govardhan peeth or pashchim main dwarikapith

 Most Hindus are worshiped by idols of God
 unke liye murti ek aasaan sa saadhan he, jisamen ki ek hi niraakaar ishwar ko kisi bhi manachaahe sundar rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Hindus do not actually worship stone and iron, as some people understand
 murtiyan hinduon ke liye ishwar kii bhakthi karne ke liye ek saadhan maatr hai
 The places of worship of Hindus are called temples
 pracheen vaidic kaal main mandir nahin hote the
 The worship was then in place of fire in which a gold idol was installed as a symbol of God
 ek najariye ke mutabik buddha or jain dharmon dwaara buddha or mahavir kii murtiyon or mandiron dwaara puja karne kii vajah se hindu bhi unase prabhavit hokar mandir banane lage
 Every temple is worshiped by one or more deities

 If the customer did not use an MSL, they would lose the difference of $ 300 - $ 400 that is paid in their monthly bill, as some customers cancel existing service and take the phone to another carrier
 MSL sim par lagu hota he sirf isliye ek baar anubandh puraa hone ke baad MSL phir bhi sim par lagu rahata he

 Jai Singh remained in Amer since his return from the south in July 1698, when the emperor also sent a number of 'strict calls' to attend him
 From his father's time, the delhi-emperor
 They wanted to call them in the south to take their military service
 parantu raja vishnusingh apane putr ko dakshin main nahin bhejnaa chaahate the
 But in 1698, he went to Maharashtra on the pressure of the emperor
 aath maheene mogul shivi main rah kar ye vaapis apni rajdhani amer laut aaye
 Immediately after sitting on the throne, as noted above, he was called in November 1700 to fight with his army in the south as an army of Mughal emperors, but somehow Jaising continued to evade
 vah jab kai shahi-adeshon kii avhelnaa kar chuke, to antat inhen 'jabaran' le aane ko badshaah ne kuch harkare amer tak bhi bheje| inaki anupasthiti se naaraaz badshaah aurangzeb ne in se amer raja kaa khitaab to nahin chhina, par 13 sitambar 1701 ko inhen 'padaavnat' karte hue maatr 500 jaat, 100 savaar kaa maamuli manasabadaar bana diya
 He was appointed as his military aide for the protection of Panhala near Aurangzeb's grandson Shah Bidarbakht when he reached the south in October 1701, battling difficult routes and rain-blocked routes
 aurangzeb ke pote shah bidarbakht ke netritv main baadashahi sena ne 11 may i0 1702 ko khilanaa ke kile par baari hamalaa kiya
 In this Amer and Mughal combined forces suffered a lot of casualties, but by breaking its walls, the first Kachwaha army of Jai Singh entered the Blossom-fort
 uski burj par amer kaa 'pancharanga jhanda' fahraaya gaya
 
 khilanaa-yuddh main inkaa vir or bharosemand dewan buddhasingh maaraa gaya
 On this blossom-conquest, King Aurangzeb raised his mansab to 2000, first after the request of Shah Bidarbakht
 badshaah kii chah saal kii 'kathin seva' kaa mahaz yah pratidaan jaisingh ko mila! iske baad jab shahjada bidarbakht malwe kaa soobedaar hua, tab usne jaisingh kii sevaaon kaa sammaan karte un ko vahaan kaa naayab soobedaar bana diya, jise aurangzeb ne tatkaal hi 'naamanzoor' kar diya tathaa ek farmaan likhaa ki ainda kisi hindu bhi ko maamuli faujadaar tak bhi nahin banaaya jaae
 ' vidmbana haratangez he ki jis aurangzeb ne kabhi inhen 'savai' kah kar sammaan diya vahi baad main vastutah inase is kadar naaraaz or purvaagrahagrast tha ki usne ye apmanjanak ajna jari kii- "jaisingh ko masanad par asana na de kar, neeche zamin par bichhi 'sujani' par baithne ko kaha jaay!" Meanwhile, in AD 1704, two Badshahi Faujdars took local help and snatched the fief from Thakur Kushal Singh Rajawat to the Jhilaiya hideout located in Sawai Madhopur on 13 November 1704
 duusare saal i0 1705 main shah bidarbakht ne apni taraf se inke paksh main phir se koshish karke jaisingh ko malwa kaa bhi naayab soobedaar banavaa diya
 But as long as Aurangzeb survived, his influence in the Mughal camp remained mild
 i0 1707 main 21 farvari ko aurangzeb ke dehanth ke baad mogul-gaddi ke liye uske beton main vikat-sangharsh shuru ho gaya
 Shah Azam invaded Agra and Delhi
 us samay tak usne inkaa mansab 5000 jaat 500 savaar kaa kar diya tha
 On June 18, 1707, the battle of Jaju took place 20 miles south of Agra between the armies of Maujam and Azam
 jaisingh maujam ke saath the tathaa inke sage chote bhai chimaan ji aazam kii sena kii taraf
 Maujam and his sons were killed in this war
 jaju kii ladaai main aazam kii vijay hui
 Jai Singh and Akhesin Torei were also injured in this war
 Many of their chiefs - Bihari Das, Kesari Singh, Sursingh etc
 were killed
 yuddh ke aakhri samay main jaisingh bundi ke raja apane bahanoi budhsingh hada ke marfat yuddh main vijayi aazam se ja mili, parantu usne inkaa khaas swaagat nahin kiya
 , jaisingh ke chote bhai vijaisingh, badshaah ko khush karne ke liye apni bahan kaa vivaah badshaah bahadurshah se karwaanaa chaahate the
 He sent the news of this to Delhi and stopped Buddha Singh Hada on his way on leave and got him married in Samode
 naye badshaah bahadurshah ne iske baad rajasthan par chadhaai kii
 In January 1708, he reached Amer and took it to Khalsa
 jaisingh se amer kii jaagir jabt karke badshaah bahadurshah dwaara 10 janvari 1708 ko unke chote bhai vijaisingh ko anekanek mahange uphaaron sahit de di gayi
 Sawai Jaisingh's political stature was reduced to a modest 'mansabdar'
 badshaah iske baad ajmer hokar dakshin ke liye apane bhai kambaksh se muqabla karne ko badha
 Both the kings of Amber and Jodhpur went with him to the area of mandleshwar
 jab unhen yah aashaa nahin rahi ki badshaah unke ilaake unhen waapas lautaaega to unhone durgadas rathod kii raay se, jab badshaah narbada nadi paar karne ko ravaanaa hua, 20 april 1708 baishakh sudi 13 ko baadashahi-shivi chhod diya or ve raajapootaana kii ore waapas ravaanaa hokar mewar udaipur pahunche
 Here, Maharana Pratap's son and heir Rarana Amar Singh welcomed him and married his granddaughter Jai Singh
 yahan se teen raajaaon kii 30 hajaar sena ne sanyukt-rup se jodhpur par hamalaa karke 8 july 1708 i0 ko use apane adhikaar main kar liya
 Jai Singh of Raja At Singh Jodhpur vaccinated
 yahan se unhone hindustan ke anek raajaaon ko mughalon ke viruddh ekatrit hone sambandhi patr bhi likhe
 Two armies were sent from Joghpur to take control of the Amer ruled by Vijay Singh
 ek durgadas rathod ke netritv main, jiskaa saiyadon se kaala deraa ke paas yuddh hua
 In the Second Army, Maharaja Jai singh's Diwan Ram Chandra and Shyam Singh had 20,000 cavalry
 inkaa ratanpura ke paas amer ke faujadaar hossain khan se yuddh hua, jisamen unhone use parrast karke amer par apana adhikaar kar liya
 After this, the groom against these two kings 





 xxrep 4 ? Sambhar sent to Mewat's Faujdar Syed Hussain Khan, Ahmed Khan Faujdar Bairath Sidhana and Garat Khan Faujdar Narnol
 donon raajaaon ke in faujadaaron se sambar main 3 oktober i0 1708 ko bheeshan yuddh hua, jisamen mughalon kii vijay hui
 After the war, the Mughals were feeling happy in victory
 isi samay raav sangramsingh ke netritv main naruka ladaake vahaan pahunche or ek ret ke tibe par chadhe, jiske neeche saiyad aadi mehfil kar rahe the
 The nerds attacked him suddenly with guns and arrows
 usamen sab mogul faujadaar maare gayi tathaa mughalon kii jiti hui baaji haath se nikal gai
 Then Jai Singh wrote a letter against the emperor to Durgadas that "speak to Udaipur Maharana 


 Rajputs should do what the pride of 'hindustan' should do against the Mughals, including the Marathas
 " When Emperor Bahadur Shah returned from the south, he considered it necessary to somehow compromise both the Jodhpur and Amer kings
 inhen laane ke liye usne budhsingh haada raja bundi ko bheja, jinke marfat 21 june i0 1710 ko ye ajmer ke paas badshaah ke saamne hajir hue
 The emperor returned the seized states to them and also gave the mansab of 4000 and 4000 riders to these two
 us samay tak bhi rajputon kaa mughalon par bilkul vishwaas nahin tha, isliye jab savai jaisingh ajmer main badshaah ke shivi main gayi tab ajmer ke tamaam pahaad tathaa ghaatiyaan rajput-sainikon se bhari hui thim
 He never had full faith in Bahadur Shah's intention even after Mansab grew and returned to the area
 jaisingh ke bhai vijaisingh ke saath bhi kuch aisa hua ki niraash hokar ant main mughal darbar chhod kar hindun aa gaye
 Jai Singh was still an armed rebellion threat from brother Vijay Singh
 inhone 1713 i0 main vijaisingh se samjhauta karne or 'rajmata se bhent' karne ke naam par apane sashastr sainikon evam saradaaron samet sanganer ja kar dhokhe se unako kaid karvaa diya or jaigarh kile main bhej diya
 Shyam Singh Khangarot was a special assistant in this 'assassination' of Vijay Singh
 bahadur shah kii mrityu ke baad uske uttaradhikari jahandarshah ne amer or marwar donon raajaaon ko phir apane paksh main karnaa chaha
 He also gave the mansab of 7000 castes and 7000 riders to both, but this time they decided to stay away from Aurangzeb's sons in the mutual struggle between the Mughal heirs
 farrukh sier ke mogul badshaah banane ke baad hossain ali saiyad ne shyamsingh khangarot ko bulawaaya tathaa unase baat karke jaisingh ko badshaah se 5000 jaat 4500 savaar kaa mansab dilvaaya
 When At Singh differed with the emperor, the emperor sent Syed Hussain Ali with his army to Ajmer, where Attingh was captured
 us samay jaisingh bhi hossain ali saiyad ke saath the
 In the end there was a treaty with At Singh
 oktober 1713 i0 main inhen badshaah farrukh sier ne malwa kii soobedaari pradaan kii
 He suppressed many rebellions there and also suppressed the nuisance of the marines
 marahathon kii ek badi sena jab malwe main ghusi tab inhone palsood ke paas use badi karaari haar di
 Marathi army men fled and stayed in Palsud
 jaisingh ne raat main hi un par hamalaa kar diya
 Seeing his army, he escaped and crossed the Nervada River
 unki lut kaa sab maal vahiin rah gaya
 Chhatrasal Bundela was also with him in Malwa
 1715 i0 main inako dilli bula liya gaya
 Then in his absence, he put his Dhabhai Ruparam there as a hero
 1717 tak ye malwa ke soobedaar rahe
 Emperor Farrukh Sier gave the princely state of Bundi to Bhimsingh Hada king Kota and he also captured Bundi
 jaisingh ne prayaas karke badshaah se bundi waapas raja budhsingh hada ko dilvaayi
 The emperor from Delhi ordered them to climb Chudaman Jat of Bharatpur, which had caused a great disturbance in the area of agra from looting
 inke saath bundi ke buddhasingh, kota ke bhimsingh, narvar ke gajsingh, durgadas rathod va kai anya manasabadaar bhi niyukt kiye gayi
 On 15 September 1716, he took his army and left for Mathura
 navambar main chudaaman ke prasiddh kile thun kaa gheraa shuru kiya
 Var Abdullah Khan was against Syed, Jaysingh and was helping Chudaman
 isse inhen is abhiyaan main safalataa nahin mil pai
 Var Abdullah Khan Syed finally took up the circle of Thun after falling in between
 may 1718 main jaisingh kii vaapasi dilli hui
 Despite this failure in the area of chudaman, he was respected by the emperor
 saiyadon or baadshahon ke bich talavaarein khinch chuki thi
 Jaisingh persuaded Emperor Farrukh Sayar that he should be cleaned forever after fighting the Syed
 us samay unke paas 20 hajaar rajput savaar dilli main maujuud the tathaa bundi ke buddhasingh hada bhi unheen ke saath the
 But the king did not dare to take this military action
 vah saiyadon ko kisi tarah khush karne main laga rahaa
 Finally, the Sayyids asked the emperor Jaisingh to leave Delhi
 jaisingh ne badshaah ko sachet kiya ki unke jane se badshaah kii jaan ko khatra ho jayega lekin yah salaah badshaah kii samaj main nahin ai
 Jaisingh left Delhi on 13 February 1719 AD
 uske kuch hi ghanton baad bheenmasingh kota raja ne budhsingh bundi par akraman kar diya
 His loyal devotee Sardar Jait Singh with great valor stopped the army of Kota and removed Budh Singh from there safely
 ve bhaag kar savai jaisingh ke paas pahunche
 On April 17- 18, Syed brothers, At Singh Jodhpur and Bhimsingh Kota together killed the emperor Farrukhsiyar in Delhi
 jaisingh ne elahabaad ke soobedaar chhabila ram or nizaam se saiyadon ke viruddh bhi patr-vyavhaar kiya
 They wanted everyone to oust the Sayyids together
 inhone chhatrasaal bundela ko bhi yuddh ke liye bulaayaa
 The Sayyids sent several armies to surround them from many sides
 On 5 July, Var Abdullah Khan, along with the nominal Emperor Rafiudullah, marched on Jai Singh and reached Agra via Mathura, where rebellion against the Sayyids was taking place
 jaisingh ne bhi saiyadon se puure taur se muqabla karne kii taiyaari kar lee thi par yuddh main ravaanaa hone ke pehle unhone brahmanon ko bulaakar amer rajya daan main de diya or kesaria bana dhaaran karke ve saiyadon se ladaai ke liye ravaanaa hue
 They had reached Toda Raisingh from Amer
 par nizaam or chhabilaram donon hi vaayade ke anusaar inke paksh main kaayam nahin rahe
 Jaisingh felt disappointed
 ant main atsingh jaisingh ko apane saath jodhpur le gayi jahaan unhone apni putree kaa jaisingh se vivaah kiya
 The Syed gave Rs 20 lakh to Jaisingh, so that they could buy Amber back from the Brahmins
 us samay bhi jaisingh ko atsingh jodhpur par vishwaas nahin tha isliye ve apane vivaah main bhi jirahabakhtar pahan kar gayi the
 When the two Sayyid forces were defeated by the Nizam in the south, Hussain Ali Khan Syed, accompanied by Emperor Mohammad Shah, proceeded to suppress the Nizam with a large army
 sitambar 8, 1720 i0 ko todabhim main usne hossain ali ko dhokhe se maar daalaa
 Now the emperor prepared and mounted Syed Abdullah Khan who was in Delhi
 is yuddh ke liye maharana ne jaisingh se poocha ki 'use kya karnaa chahie?' jaisingh ne udapur ke maharana ko badshaah kii madad karne ke liye patr likhaa tathaa saath main hi maharana ke alaava bikaner, kota or raav indrasingh nagaur ko bhi badshaah kii madad karne ke liye patr bheje
 Sawai Jaisingh himself sent a good army with Rao Jagram to help the emperor Mohammad Shah
 is sena main savai ram, gadhi gajsingh, naruka jaavali, jaswantsingh, sawairam ke putr, pratapsingh kalyanot, buddhasingh kalyanot, gulab singh kalyanot, chhitarsingh kalyanot, amarsingh rajaavat, bahadur singh khangoraat or sardarsingh naruka aadi sardaar the
 On 3 and 4 November 1720, there was a war in which Syed Abdullah Khan was captured
 vijay ke baad badshaah ne jaipur ke saradaaron ko apane haath se khichhaten deen
 Mohammad Shah, on reaching Delhi, sent Jaisingh an order to come to Delhi, in which he wrote that he has to take advice on many important problems
 usne dilli pahunchane par badshaah ne apane naye var mohammad amin khan ko unke dere par lene bheja
 On coming to the court, the emperor gave him a big welcome and gave many gifts
 unke mansab main 4000 savaar or badha die gaye
 On this occasion, he gave them two crores of rupees in reward / money which he humbly refused to take
 par badshaah ne savai jaisingh or raja giradhar bahadur ke anurodh par hiduon par lagaaya jane vaala kathin jajia kar maaf kar diya
 Maharana Mewar sent a written congratulation to Sawai Jaisingh on his success to give Jaziya Hatwa
 saiyadon ke patan ke baad jaisingh kaa rajnatik mahatv tezi se badhane laga
 The kings of Rajasthan, Malwa and Bundelkhand wanted help and advice from them in every trouble
 in ilaakon main inaki raay ke bagaiyr kuch bhi nahin hota tha
 After 1735 AD, the Marathas also started taking their advice and respecting them
 inhen savai ke alaava mogul baadshahon ne jo anya oopaadhiyaan samay samay par deen ve thim - saramde –raja-e- hind' / 'rajrajeshwar' / 'shrirajadhiraj aadi
 In September 1722, Jaisingh was sent as the Subedar of Agra to suppress the Jats
 inke saath 50 hajaar sainikon kii badi fouj thi tathaa anek manasabadaar bhi inke saath the
 The royal artillery was also with him
 chudaaman jat kaa putr mohakamsingh is samay jaaton kaa netaa tha
 But Chudaman's nephew Badansingh, who was angry with him, met Jai Singh
 inhone uskaa bada swaagat-satkar kiya
 Once again, they besieged the fort of Thun
 atsingh joghpur ne ek sena mohakamsingh kii madad ke liye bheji, parantu vah jobaner se aage nahin badi
 Like Vibhishan, the victory of the fort of Thun looked certain with the advice of Badansingh
 tab mohakamsingh niraash hokar gupt maarg se kila chhod kar atar singh ke paas jodhpur pahunchaa
 But Sawai Jai Singh had the right over the Jat fort at Thun
 inhone surajmal ke pita badansingh ko bharatpur kii jaagir di tathaa raja ke rup main unke pagadi baandhi
 On June 19, 1723, Thakur Badansingh Jat signed a handwriting to this effect by 'serving the Jaipur Darbar' and accepting an annual offer of Rs 83 thousand
 badansingh jaipur ke dashahra darbar main har saal aayaa karte the
 In Jaipur, where the king of Deeg, including the Jat army, used to stay, the place is still called Bas Badanpura

 Jaisingh wanted to compromise the rebellious marines for the protection of his kingdom
 inke is samjhauta-prastaav ko badshaah ne bhi sweekaar kar liya tha
 On this victory, he had read and written with Sahu
 sahu iske liye taiyaar ho gaya tha, kintu peshwa log is samjhaute ke zyada paksh main nahin tha
 He sent Deep Singh Kumbhani to Sahura near Sahu
 lautate samay deepasingh nizaam se bhi mila, parantu sitambar 1730 i0 main inke malwa kii soobedaari se hat jane se vah samjhauta nahin ho sakaa
 The relationship of Jai Singh became very bad with Bundi King Buddha Singh when Buddha Singh Bundi and his Kachwahi queen created serious differences among themselves
 ant main sambandh itane bigade ki jaisingh ne badshaah ko kah kar buddhasingh ke sthaan par karwaad ke saalim singh hada ke putr dalelsinh ko bundi kaa raja banavaa diya or baad main apni putree bhi use byaah di
 This led to a long and painful struggle between Jaipur and Bundi in Rajasthan
 is aapasi manmutav se marahathon ko phir rajasthan main hastkshep karne kaa avasar mil gaya
 Jai Singh got information in Malwa in 1730 that Buddha Singh was going to take control of Bundi again
 inhone ek sena dalelsinh kii madad ko bheji| 6 april 1730 ko kushattal pancholas main budhsingh se jaipur sena kaa yuddh hua jisamen jaipur ke paanch rajaavat sardaar fatahsingh sarsope khojuram, saanvaldas, achalsinh or ghasiram achare maare gaye

 On his return from Malwa, Maharaja Sawai Jaisingh Kushtal went to Pancholas
 unhone vahaan maare gayi saradaaron kii maatami karke unke putron ko siropav aadi diye
 Jaisingh went to Ujjain for the third time in December 1732 as Subedar of Malwa province
 is baar malwa main bhi marahathon kaa utpaat itnaa bad gaya tha ki malwa se marahathon ko nikaalane ke inke tamaam prayaas vifal rahe
 In 1734, Khandaura came forward against Marathon in Malwa via Rajputana with a large army

 On January 1737, Peshwa came to North India, along with him were Holkar, Sindhia, Panwar etc
 udaipur se aate samay peshwa se 25 farvari ko maharaja jaisingh malpura kshetra ke jhadli gaanv main mili
 He gave them many things
 bajirao dilli tak jaakar waapas laut gaya
 Maharaja Jai singh felt very sad due to the death of Bajirao Peshwa
 nayaa peshwa balarao bana
 In 1741, Jai Singh was the Subedar of Agra when the new Maratha Peshwa Bala Rao ascended to the north
 inaki or naye peshwa bala raav kii dhaulpur main bhent hui
 With his efforts, the emperor gave the Peshwa the suburb of Malwa
 jab nadirshah bharat main aayaa tab sabhi ko badi shankaa khadi ho gai
 The Peshwa, Maharana, along with other kings and Bundelas, wanted to organize an organized fight with Jaysingh, Nadirshah
 haalanki 24 farvari 1739 ko karnal main vah mogul sena ko buree tarah parajeet kar chukaa tha
 It was also rumored that Nadir Shah would go to Ajmer via Jaipur
 yah jaisingh ke liye bhi bada khatra tha
 All were alert, but in the end he returned home from Mathura
 "nadirshah ne jab bharat par hamalaa kiya tab dilli kii sahaytarth jaisingh nahin gaye
 The reason for this was - the Nizam and Qamruddin were in high positions in the empire at that time and they could be suspected to be responsible for Nadirshah's attack, but the Emperor kept believing in them and kept giving them necessary advice
 " In the court of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, many original compositions were made in the fields of Sanskrit and Brajbhasha literature, architecture, theology, astrology, astronomy, history-writing, etc
 and this academic contribution of the entire Indian Manisha was greatly enhanced

 The caliphate finally ended in 1925 at the end of the Osmani Empire
 arabi main 'caliph' shabd kaa matlab 'pratinidhi' yaa 'uttaradhikari' hota he
 After the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, those who took over the political reins of the entire Muslim world were called 'khalifa Rasool Allah', that is, 'heir of Allah's Rasool'
 jis tarah 'rais' ke raaj ko 'riyasat', 'amir' ke raaj ko 'emirate' or 'khan' ke raaj ko 'khaanat' kehete the, usee tarah 'caliph' ke raaj ko 'kilaafat' kaha jaataa tha
 Pay attention to the pronunciation of the letter 'kh' in 'khalifa' as it is slightly different from 'kh' with no dot
 iskaa uccharan 'karaab' or 'kareed' ke 'kh' se miltaa he
 The first four caliphs after the death of Prophet Muhammad are called 'rashidi Khalifa', a follower of the Sunni faith, which is also known as 'khalifa ur-rashidun' in Arabic accent and 'khalifa-e-rashidin' in Persian accent
 'raashid' kaa matlab arabi main 'sahi maarg par chalane vaala' hota he
 These four caliphs were as follows: Abu Bakr as-siddiq, Umar ibn al-khatab, Usman ibn Affan and Ali ibn Abu Talib
 yah chaaron mohammad sahab ke jeevankaal main unke saathi rahe the
 Immediately after the passing of Prophet Muhammad, Abu Bakr was chosen as the Caliph by mutual conversation and Muhammad's companions swore loyalty to him
 is chunaav se kuch log naaraaz hue kyonki unhen laga kii ali hi pigambar ke sabase qareebi sambandhi the isliye unhen hi caliph bananaa chahie tha
 Abu Bakr's rule lasted only two years from 632 to 634 that he fell ill and came to death
 dehanth se pehle unhone bina vichaar-vimarsh ke umr ko caliph bana diya
 The loyalty of Umar was sworn by only those fellows who were in Medina at that time, from which some other comrades started to ignore him as a caliph

 Omar had already formed a group of six people, out of which he had to choose a caliphate by mutual agreement

 Osman was elected and became the third Khalifa on 11 November 644
 lagbhag 12 saal baad 17 july 656 ko kuch vidrohiyon ne unki bhi hatya kar di or ali ko chauthaa caliph chunaa gaya
 Shia followers hold that the rule of the first three caliphs was illegitimate and that Ali should have been the caliph from the beginning as he was also a family relative of the Prophet and also the husband of his daughter Fatimah
 jab ali caliph bane to bahut updrav or viroh hue
 The biggest challenge came from Mu'awiyah, the governor of Damascus, a relative of Osman, and whose sister was married to the Prophet Muhammad
 muawiyah kaa kahana tha kii ali unke sambandhi osman ke qaatilon ko pakad nahin rahe hai
 He waged a 'war of Siphin' with Ali's forces on the banks of the Furat River in which no one was defeated or defeated
 koon-karaaba rokane ke liye ali muawiyah se baatcheet karne ko raji ho gaye
 Ali's forces consisted of a group of 4,000 radicals called 'khariji' and strongly held that the decision to win and win is in the hands of God and this war should not be stopped till death
 ve ali ko sahi maarg se bhatakane kaa doshi maanate hue unase alag ho gaye
 Nearly two years later, in the 'war of Naharwan' Ali had to fight the Kharijites in which Ali won

 Hasan was made the sixth Khalifa, but soon after he became the Khalifa, Mu'awiyah started inciting his forces against him
 hasan or muawiyah ke bich yuddh kii surat ban ai
 To prevent the Muslim community from dividing, Hasan compromised that he would relinquish the throne of the Caliphate and accept Mu'awiyah as the Caliph provided that after the death of Mu'awiyah, the throne was returned to Hasan or his successor
 muawiyah saatva caliph to ban gaya lekin uski marzi thi ki uske baad uskaa betaa yazid caliph bane
 Mu'awiyah is said to have instigated a wife of Hasan and fed poison to Hasan, from whom Hasan died

 Both endangered and living beings come to life
 donon main hi jaivik ghatnaayen ghatit hoti he
 Both have similarities in reproduction, but there is a difference in subtle detail
 at: unka vichaar alag alag kiya ja rahaa he
 Major methods of reproduction in flora - vanaspatik janan main koi vanaspatik bhaag, nae ped kii utpatti karata he or janak paudhe sa alag hokar nayaa jivan prarambh karata he
 There are two types of it, one is natural and the other is artificial
 yah nimnlikhit prakaar kaa hota he: Some plants also breed artificially
 kuch paudhe tanon kii kataran se, kuch paudhe kalam baandhane se or kuch daab kalam se nae paudhon ko utpann karte hai
 In asexual reproduction, special types of cells, without meeting any other entity, produce new plants
 yah vikhandan vidhi yaa bijanunirmaan vidhi se hota he
 Algae, fungi and spores etc
 are produced and grown by the first method
 duusari vidhi se janan bijaanuon dwaara hota he
 Spores are unicellular and very microscopic
 kuch shaiwalon, jalakaaiyon or kavakon main bijaanu hote hai jo keval protoplasm ke bane hote hai
 They contain floss
 aise bijaanuon ko chaljanu kehete hai
 They float with the help of chaljanyu floss and, like purebred animals, later turn into new plants
 kuch padaarthon main, jaise yulothraks chaljanu adhik sankhya main or saprolagniya main utpann hote hai
 In some algae, such as nostock, immobilized spores are produced by the cells of the spores, which fly through the air and spread
 bijanujanak se bijaanuon kaa nirmaan hota he, jinamein nar or maadaa donon hoti hai
 They come together to form gametes, which then form spores and from them spores
 adhik viksit paudhon main fal or beej dwaara langik janan hota he
 Their flowers have male gametes and female gametes, whose conjugates form gametes
 ye beej ke andar bhrun main viksit ho, ankur banakar nae paudhon ko janm dete hai
 The gametes are very fine and unicellular
 langik janan main do vibhinn janakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Sometimes two gametes of the same type breed together
 aise milan kaa samagam kehete hai
 Fertilization of two different gametes is called
 shaiwal or kavak sadrush nimna shrenee ke paudhon main samagam se janan hota he or ucch shrenee kii vanaspatiyon main nishechan se
 Plants whose gametes do not have a differentiation of male and female are called homozygous and such plants are homozygous
 nishechan main nar or maadaa ke milane se jo banaata he use shukritand, gamit ko assam yugmak or paudhe ko asamayugmiya yaa vividhpushpi kehete hai
 In addition to the above mentioned methods of reproduction, some other methods, such as sterilization, degeneration and desorption are also generated
 praaniyon main janan kii vidhiyaan do koti main baanti ja sakati hai ek alangik or duusari langik
 The difference between them is that asexual method requires only one parent for reproduction and the division of progenitor and progenitor is done by mitosis
 langik janan ke liye do janakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or isamen samasutran ke atirikt ardhasuthran or nishechan kii kriyaayein hoti hai
 Lower-class animals are born by both asexual and sexual methods, but higher-grade animals are born only through sexual methods
 yah janan pind ke do yaa do se adhik sam bhaagon main vibhaajan se hota he
 This division is called fragmentation
 yah vikhandan dwivikhandan, bahuvikhandan yaa bijanukaran kaa rup le saktaa he
 An example of dichotomy is found in amoebae
 samudbhavan se bhi janan hota he
 Sponges, sealantreta, and bryozoa have germination in the form of amplification or tubules
 kuch praaniyon main punarutpaadan kii shakti hoti he
 If any part of their body is damaged or cut, then it gets rebuilt

 mapevidya yaa maapvigyaan main maapan ke sabhi saidhantik or vyaavhaarik pahaluon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 It is the science of measurement and its applications
 maapvigyaan bhautikee kii vah shakha he jisamen shuddh maap ke bare main hamen gyaan hota he
 In metrology, basically we discuss about the three quantities, that is, mass, length, and time, and with the knowledge of these three quantities, we measure other quantities, such as density, volume, force, and power
 maapvigyaan dwaara aparivartaneey maanakon kaa nirdesh hi nahin miltaa, varan inhen kaayam bhi rakhaa jaataa he
 By these standards, we also measure and compare the properties of objects
 doosraa paksh yah he ki kisi kaarivishesh ko drushti main rakhkar maapvigyaan se aise tareeke praapt hote hai jinase tulanaayen kaaphi ucch str kii shuddhta tak kii ja saken
 In the modern sciences and industries, the above basic comparisons must be very pure
 maap purnataya thik nahin hoti or nishchit rup se usamen kuch na kuch praayogic galati sadaa hi rahati he
 Nowadays the following approximations of accuracy are found in the more fundamental functions of metrology: antarrashtriya adirup kilogram ke do platinum iridium namoonon kii tulana main : 10,00,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Compared to ordinary chemical weights: one part in 10,00,000
 sookshmmapi tula dwaara chote chote bhaaron kii tulana main : 10,00,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Compared to two yards or standard meters: one part per 1,00,00,000
 antya maanak kii rekhamanak se tulana main : 10,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Determination of normal volume and density: one part per 10,000
 antya maanak ke kulak ke anshankan, 1 inch kii lambaai se kam nahin main 10,00,000 main ek bhaag
 0
 xxrep 5 0 5 inches, or 0
0001 millimeters, in full length posts of calibration of marked yards or subdivisions of metal scales
 saadhaarant: prayog main aanevaale maanakon ke liye is vishay ko maap or taul sheershak lekh main dekhen
 Wavelength as a natural standard - subsequent progress has changed our beliefs to a great extent
 sarvapratham, vaigyanik micelson ke prayogon ne ek prakritik maanak, kaa tarangadairdhya, sthapit kiya, jo sarvasammati se maan liya gaya yah maanak kam se kam utani hi ucch str kii shuddhta ke saath punarutpaadaneey he jitani dravyatmak maanakon kii tulanaaon main paaya jaataa he
 But the best feature of this standard is that it is beyond the possibility of long-term variance, whereas all other types of standards are used
 prithvi ke kisi bhi bhaag main ham is prakritik maanak kii sahaayta se dravyatmak maanakon kaa satyaapan kar sakate hai
 If the fluid parameters are to be compared to the prototype meter by sending it to the international central laboratory, then there is a possibility of loss in traffic, but with the help of natural standard we can do this work in our own laboratory
 duusari baat yah he ki is prakaar ke sudhaaron se chapate sironvaale maanakon kaa vikaas hua
 Nowadays such punishments are also attainable, whose ends are completely parallel
 is prakaar ke dandon kii lambaaiyon ko rekhiy maanak se na nikaalkar sidhe prakaashiya vyatikaran se nikaala jaataa he
 Michelson's interferometer was also used to know how many light waves come in a standard meter and what is their number? Michaelsen identified the international meter at 150 centigrade heat and 760 mm 0 atmosphere pressure, which is housed at the International Institute of Measurements and Weights near Paris, in the cadmium red lines
 yah maan 15,53,163
5 he, jo 2 ́106 main ek seemaa tak sahi he
 Subsequent experiments by Fabri Para revealed that this number is 15,53,164
13 in a meter in dry air at 15 ° c and 760 millimeter pressure
 yadi micelson ke prayogen main jalawaashp ke prabhaav ke liye sanshodhan kiya jaay, to yah spasht hota he ki donon ke maan main koi antar nahin he
 There is evidence that the fluid standard yard has probably decreased by 0
0002 inches since its construction, but it has remained unchanged as far as the international prototype meter is concerned
 micelson tathaa fabri paro ke prayogon ne ise siddh bhi kar diya he
 The basis of their comparison was the red line of cadmium
 dravya ke sab sab maanak meter ek mishradhatu ke banaae jate hai, jiske nirmaan main 90% platinum tathaa 10% iridium naamak dhaatu hoti he
 In this type, meters are considered to be most satisfactory for basic standards
 bahut se kaaryon main, jahaan atyant hi yatharth maap kii samasya aa khadi hoti he, vahaan yah aavashyak he ki ham aise dravya kaa vyavhaar karen jiskaa tapiya prasar naam maatr kaa ho
 Such metals have been discovered and one of them is called 'invar'
 yah nikal tathaa ispaat kii mishradhatu he, jisamen 36% nikal rahata he
 The second alloy is labeled stable invar
 isamen thodaa chromium bhi hota he
 This alloy has a much lower spread than ordinary invar, even then it cannot be considered as a constant
 doosraa dravya sangalit silica he, jiskaa prasar gunank bahut hi kam he
 This material increases only 0
4 ́10-6 by one degree Celsius
 sangalit silica kaa maanak meter ek nalee ke aakaar kaa hota he, jiske sire par samaantar patt sanlin hote hai
 On its platinized plane, the lines are carved
 is maanak ke bare main jahaan tak gyaat he, isaki lambaai main koi parivartan nahin hua he
 Since this type of standard is very fragile, it was neither accepted as a fundamental reference standard nor was it practiced in daily work
 keval maapvigyaan prayogshaalaon main ise prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 No natural standard has yet attempted to define a unit code
 ham sabhi laagon ko yah gyaat he ki radio sakriy padaartho kii khoj main pehle sanhati yaa dravyaman padaarth kaa ek aavashyak sthir gun mana jaataa tha
 Changes in the codification or mass standard of weavers are possible only due to abrasion, oxidation and hygienic absorption
 yadi dravyon ke maanakon kaa sangrakshan tathaa upyog uchit saavdhaanee ke saath kiya jaay, to ye kaaphi had tak bhaar kii sthirataa kaa pradarshan karte hai
 The basic weighting standard is made of platinum and iridium alloys
 isi mishradhatu kaa upyog 'rajkeey maanak pound' tathaa 'antarrashtriya aadi praroop kilogram' ke nirmaan main kiya gaya he
 After several years when the various national copies of the kilogram were re-compared, it was found that the level of stability was up to one part in 108
 isse maanakon kii yatharyata hi nahin varan tulanaaon kii purnataa bhi parilakshith hoti he
 a second material, in which a high degree of stability of the cod is found, is called crystal quartz
 isamen trutiyaan ye hai ki iskaa ghanatv apekshaakrit kam he or yah aarta avasorak he
 These standards remove different volumes of air when comparing air codification standards
 at: sanhati ke maanakon kii tulana karne main upree utplavan prabhaav kaa vichaar avashya rakhana chahie
 If the density of the standard is low, the buoyancy modification will be high
 platinum-iridium maanakon kii aapasi tulana main jo shuddhta praapt hoti he, vah is satyansh par aadhrut he ki inkaa ghanatv adhik hi nahin varan bahut paas paas hota he
 Due to this the buoyancy modification is very less
 un bhaaron kii tulana main utplavan sanshodhan ek samasya ke rup main aa khadaa hota he jinke ghanatv main bahut antar hota he jinke, jaise platinum, quartz tathaa pital aadi
 It is necessary to weigh in an airless environment to remove this defect
 pratidin ke vyapaarik kaaryon main taul kaa kaary hawa main hi hota he or utplavan ke kaaran jo antar baaton tathaa maal main hota he, vah vyapaarik drushtikon se naganya he
 The inspectors employ the standard of the weights of brass, which has a density of 8
143, to compare the trade weights
 jab ham vayurahit vaataavaran main taul nahin karte hai, tab bhi dravyaman ke praathmik maanakon kii sahi tulana ke liye tula kii banaavat uttam, prayog kii reeti daksh tathaa satark honi chahie
 To keep the zero plate reading constant, it is necessary to take utmost care in temperature stability

 The use of weights should be done by mechanical control from outside the balance, or by driving with long rods
 tula kii tandi kaa sanchalan yaa to doordarshee se dekhnaa chahie athwa paimaane ke aar paar tandi se lage hue shishe se paravartit hote ek prakashpunj kii maapni par gati se
 The effect of heat is minimal on the bent, so it is necessary that the stem of the invar is brought into practice, but that the inwar is somewhat magnetic
 yadi atyant ucch str kii shuddhta kii aavashyaktaa ho, to yah aavashyak he ki tula kii tandi chumbakeey prabhaav se purnataya prachhann ho or tula ko ek lohe ke baks main rakhaa jaae
 Small weights are used for weighing small quantities and especially in comparison to the densities of gases, which are made of fully reinforced quartz

 These people have migrated from eastern Tibet and settled in these areas of Nepal in the last 200 years
 nepal ke pahari kshetron ke log sherpa striyon ko sherpani kehete hai
 Due to their talent to be perfected in mountaineering, these Sherpas are used in Nepal for the guides of mountaineers and the carrying of luggage

 Michel Foucault was the leading thinker and philosopher of France
 phuko kii ginati 20 veen sadi ke sabase pramukh vichaarkon main se kii jaati hai
 It was the influence of Fuko's writings that revolutionary changes took place in many areas of modern science, and especially in the field of history writing
 rajya kii sanstha logon se kaise apni baat manawaati he— is samaj main sabase taaja or vicharottejak vikaas mishael phuko ne kiya he
 The bourgeoisie does not establish its social power in the state only through instruments of violence
 vah tarah-tarah ke saanskrithik roopon kaa istemaal karke bhi apni saamaajik satta kii nirantarata sunishchit karata he
 Therefore it is also necessary to understand the structures of the state in their cultural forms
 antatah rajya ke paksh main sahmati paidaa karne kii zimmedaari ye saanskrithik sanrachanaayen hi nibhaati hai
 Fuko explains that in order to control or discipline people in modern society, a multi-layered system of surveillance, besides assimilating the decisions made by others and the examination system, are adopted
 phuko jor dekar kehete hai ki logon par drushti rakhane maatr se satta kaa aadha kaam puraa ho jaataa he
 For this, he cites the arrangement of the stadium in which the seats are arranged in such a way that the audience can easily watch an event but at the same time this system also provides the power controllers to keep an eye on the audience
 yahan phuko anushaasan or niyantran kii satta kaa model chihnit karne ke liye raajnneetik chintak jeremi bantham dwaara kalpit jail panopticon kaa ullekh bhi karte hai
 The original Vastu-plan was such that the prisoners kept in the cells should be invisible to each other but could not be out of the prison's central tower
 kaidiyon ko kabhi is baat kaa pataa nahin chalata ki un par nigaah rakhi ja rahi he yaa nahin par unke mastishk main yah baat baith jaati he ki koi un par drushti rakhata he
 Fuco views the Panoptican doctrine as a metaphor that transcends the prison boundary and becomes a common pattern of discipline in schools, factories and hospitals
 haalaanki bantham kii yah prastaavit jail kabhi moort rup nahin le paayi lekin ek siddhant ke rup main vah aadhunik samaaj kii lagbhag har gatividhi par kabizj ho gayi he
 He has proved to be a tool for disciplining systems in modern society, which has overthrown the kings and princes of the pre-modern period and has established himself in their place
 is kram main phuko yah bhi darshaate hai ki aadhunik satta yaa anushaasan kaayam karne vaali vyavastha keval logon kii gatividhiyon par hi nazar nahin rakhti balki vah logon ko unki aakshamata dikhaakar bhi niyantrit karti he
 According to him, modern power creates categories like understanding, talent, normal and unusual behavior, and when a person does not meet the criteria or standards established by it, the system does not miss an opportunity to declare such person as inferior or abnormal
 is sandarbh main phuko yah yaad dilaanaa nahin bhoolatey ki aadhunik samaaj kii in anushaasankaree sansthaaon kaa yah ravaiya kisi tarah ke pratishodh se nahin balki sudhaar se prerit hota he
 The ultimate goal of which is that the person accepts the norms or standards provided by the society
 dhyaan den ki samaaj kii manyataon ke dwaara anushaasan kaayam karne kaa yah dhang nyaayik dand kii us vyavastha se khaasaa alag he jisamen kisi vyakti ko keval is aadhaar par dandit kiya jaataa tha ki uskaa krity kanoon sammat he yaa nahin
 In such a decision it was not said that the person is normal or abnormal
 lekin aadhunik samaaj shaikshik kaaryakramon, chikitsa ke taur-tareekon tathaa udyog va utpaadon ke maamalon main kuch nishchit maanak sthapit karne par jor detaa he or in maanakon kaa varchasv itnaa chautarfa hota he ki vyakti kaa vyavhaar or vyaktitv unheen ke hisaab se dhalane lagata he
 The state is generally seen as a governance, organization or political community
 mana jaataa he ki itihaas ke har daur main iske vividh rup maujuud rahe hai
 Changes in this have been the major subjects of history
 sirf aadim ghumantu raajnneetik samudaayon ko rajya kaa darza nahin diya jaataa he
 It is believed that in these communities, there is a lack of a definite system associated with this concept
 asal main rajya hone ke liye yah aavashyak he ki samudaay or bhu-kshetra ke bich takreeban sthai sambandh ho
 When used in this general way, the term expresses the idea that the political community has certain universal characteristics that go beyond time and space; That is, Greek polis, some common features between medieval regnums and modern republics
 kya is gun yaa visheshta ko zyaada sankuchit rup main paribhashit kiya ja saktaa he? It is clear that if a definition of the state presents it as an eternal and immutable object or organization, by doing so it ignores the process of change and development in history
 isliye ek vaid paribhaasha ko duusare pahaluon or kaaryon par dhyaan dena chahie
 History shows that the state as a universal phenomenon is an activity or organization imposed on human beings as necessities
 is tarah kii gatividhi ke rup main isaki kuch mukhya visheshtaayen is prakaar hai : yah manushyon or unki sampatti ke bich main ek nishchit sambandh banaata he; yaa duusare shabdon main yah manushyon ke bich ekta yaa samaaj kaa nirmaan karata he
 Therefore the existence of the state is uniquely a fundamental thing
 doosraa, yah manushyon ke bich vyavastha kii shakti, yaa shashan ke ek rup yaa aadesh or ajna paalan kaa ek sambandh sweekaar karata he
 Third, the activity that creates and sustains the state is unique, always presenting itself against people who are not part of this community
 baharhaal, rajya ko ek aitihaasik parighatna ke rup main dekhne ke baavjood is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki is par hone vaale lekhan main ek darshanik pahalu hameshaa shaamil rahaa he
 Under this, the question arises that what is the ideal form of the kind of arrangement or the state wants to establish relations between people? Has that ideal form been achieved? Is the present way of governance right? Are the external relations of the community being handled properly? In fact, considering this point of view, not only does the state emerge as a requirement imposed on human beings, but also as a problem of choice of 'right' in front of humans
 rajya main sirf araajaktaa kii jagah ek vyavastha sthapit karne kaa hi sangharsh nahin he
 Instead, it is also a struggle to establish a system that is genuine, authentic and just
 isliye, plato, arestu, hobbs, higel aadi ke lekhan ko is sawaal kaa darshanik uttar khojane kii koshish ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he ki rajya kaisaa hona chahie
 These scholars have tried to differentiate between the state and other types of human organizations and at the same time they have presented the hypothesis of their ideal state and the arguments in its favor
 saarvbhaum aitihaasik parighatna ke rup main rajya or ek darshanik avadharana ke rup main rajya ko dekhne ke vichaar ke saath rajya ko vishesh rup se aadhunik parighatna maanane ke vichaar ko bhi jodne kii aavashyaktaa he
 There are many historians and political theorists who argue that the term 'state' should be used to refer to the post-renaissance and Reformation system in Europe
 inkaa yah maananaa he ki rajya kaa sidghant darasal isi vishisht parighatna se judaa hua sidghant he
 Therefore, if it is used for organizations present in the second round of history, it will lead to confusion about its meaning
 ek sangathit vyavastha ke rup main rajya shabd kaa udai bhi chaudaavin sadi ke ant or satrahavin sadi ke bich hua
 The state's English word 'state' derives from the Latin word 'steer', meaning to stand
 is tarah yah ek sthiti ke bare main bataata he
 One of the main ideas behind considering the state as a modern concept is that the emergence of the modern state coincided with the concept of sovereignty
 yah ek spasht aadhunik manyata he ki jo rajya prabhusatta-sampann nahin he, vah sahi arthon main rajya hi nahin he
 Sovereignty means that the state is the supreme source of political authority in the territory under its purview
 prabhusatta ke do pahalu hai— aantarik pahalu or bahari pahalu
 The internal aspect means that there is no authority higher than the state within the boundaries of the state
 rajya sarvocch he or naagarik rajya ke kilaaf kisi anya praadhikari se apil nahin kar saktaa he
 External sovereignty means the recognition given by other states to a particular state
 saath hi, isamen yah bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki koi rajya antarrashtriya maamalon main apane nagarikon kii ore se bol saktaa he
 This right expresses the autonomy and sovereignty of the state in the international arena
 rajya ko ek aadhunik parighatna maanane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki ise ek aitihaasik satta yaa darshanik vichaar ke rup main bhi kaarij kar diya jaye
 It also cannot be said that no feature of the modern state was present in the earlier period of history
 asal main, aadhunik daur ke pehle ke ‘rajya’ or aadhunik daur ke saath saamne aaye ‘rajya’ kii kai visheshtaayen samaan hai
 Likewise, it cannot be said that the state as a philosophical idea represents the 'complete concept' of the modern state
 asal main darshanik rup se rajya kii avadharana alag- alag tareekon se kalpit or vivechit kii jaati rahi he
 For example, liberals saw states as a 'neutral' institution, but there has been serious and varied discussion within liberalism about the role of the state
 marxvad ke bheetar bhi rajya ke lekar vaad-vivaad kii samrudgh parampara rahi he
 In this, apart from considering the state as the instrument of the capitalist classes, the debate related to 'relative autonomy of the state' has also been included
 araajaktaavaadiyon ne rajya ko ek aprakritik satta maane hue ise puri tarah khatm karne kii vakaalat kii he
 Even in the writings of marx-engels, a communist situation has been envisaged in which the state will be completely destroyed
 lekin araajaktaavaadi aisi kisi sthiti kaa intazaar karne kii bajaay rajya ko jald-se-jald khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 They believe that the state is based on violence against the natural nature of man
 duusari ore, anudaarataavaadi rajya kii tarafadaari isliye karte hai taaki vah kai pidiyon se sanchit paramparaon or mulyon kaa sangrakshan kar paye
 The state has been thought of differently in the various streams within feminists
 udhaaharan ke taur par, udaarataavaadi-nariwad yah maanata he ki ek sanstha ke rup main rajya purush varchasv kii ore jhukaa hua he, lekin kanoon banaakar rajya kii is pravriti main sudhaar kiya ja saktaa he or iskaa upyog purush-mahila samanta sthapit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, socialist-feminism considers the capitalist character of the state as the main reason for the problem of women
 isaki manyata he ki poonjeewaadi rajya khatm karne se hi striyon kii sthiti main sudhaar ho saktaa he
 Third, according to the radical feminist view, the state works to protect the family based on patriarchy and the values it promotes
 isliye pitrusatta ko puri tarah khatm karne ke liye aavashyak he ki rajya ko bhi khatm kiya jaae
 Clearly, there is much varied and intense debate about the state, its nature and role
 haal ke daur main europee union jaisi sanrachanaon ke ubhaar ke kaaran yah tark diya gaya he ki rajya dhire-dhire apraasangik ho rahaa he
 But this argument is not very strong
 yah sach he ki europee union main shaamil deshon ne ek majboot kshetreey sanghathan ko banane ke liye apni sahmati di he
 Nevertheless, they do not want to end their identity as a nation-state
 duusare kai kshetreey sanghathanon ne bhi kshetra ke deshon ke bich sahyog badhaayaa he, lekin is baat kii koi sambhaavna nazar nahin aati he ki ve raashtra-rajya kaa vikalp sabit honge
 In the contemporary world, the state is a reality that has no chance of ending
 vaicharik rup se iskaa virodh karne vaale kai vichaardhaaraon ke anuyaayi vyaavhaarik mauka milane par bhi rajya kii sanstha ko khatm kar paane main naakaam rahe hai

 France Emil Silampa was the novelist of Finland
 1939 i0 main sahitya main nobel puraskaar vijeta
 Emil Silampa was born on 16 September 1888 into a very poor family
 pita dihadi majdoor the or maa naukaraani
 The condition of poverty was that many children, not only their minor crops, seeds and pets, were also killed and only Silampa survived the miracle of nature due to being brought up in Finland's terrible winter climate
 balak silampa ko ek ghumantu skool mila, jisamen praarambhik shiksha hui
 In study, the clever Silampa soon found a regular school and started driving
 acchhee shiksha ke liye logon ne balak ko baahar bhejne kii salaah di or mata-pita ne pet katkar bete ko padhne ke liye shahar bheja
 Silampa passed matriculation in 1908 with good marks and due to the generosity of a kind man, he started studying biology at Helsinki University
 vishvavidhyalay main dattachitt hokar padhai main jute silampa ko lekhak, kalakar or buddhijivi doston kii sohabat mili or ve paathyakram ke alaava bhi duusari kitaaben padhane lage
 Five years later, Silampa learns that the exams are still far away and that the donor is now unable to help
 bachi-khuchi rakam lekar silampa gaanv laute to dekha maa-baap pehle se bhi bure halaat main din kaat rahe hai
 The son now lives with his parents and starts thinking of some help
 maa-baap ke kaamkaaj main haath bantaate hue silampa ne ek din pados ke gaanv se likhane ke liye kaagaj-lipaphe kharide or chhadmanaam se ek kahani likhakar najdiki shahar ke ek bade akhbaar ko bhej di
 Like a miracle, the story appeared on the front page of the newspaper and the remuneration was different
 us akhbaar main chhadmanaam se likhane kaa silsilaa chal padaa or ek nae pratibhashali lekhak kii charchaa aam ho gai, bas use dhundhane bhar kii der thi
 Soon people found the young writer Sillanpa
 ek prakaashak ne aage aakar agrim raashi dekar silampa ko ek kitaab likhane ke liye anubandhit kar liya
 In the life of a miracle-filled Silampa, during a dance in a village in 1914, a girl, Seagrid Maria, is found as a maid

 1914 main ek akhbaar ke liye lekh likhane ke liye ve sweden or denmark kii yatra par nikal padate hai or patrkaar banane kii soch lete hai
 But in the face of writing and journalism, he writes his first novel 'life and Son' in 1916
 yuddh kii ashanka ke mandaraate badalon bhare dinon main ek yuvak or do yuvatiyon ke prem trikon ko bayaan karne vaale is upanyaas ko janata main lokapriyata or aalochakon kii prashansa donon hasil huin
 Meanwhile a civil war broke out in the country, with Silampa supporting General Mannerheim, who was with the German white army
 grihayuddh kii samaapti ke baad sillanpa ko laga ki is yuddh se aakhirkaar kya hasil hua, sivaay hajaaron logon ke raktapaat ke? yuddh ke baad silampa ne yuddh ke kaaran anaath hue bacchon ke kalyaan ke liye kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 With this he continued to write stories
 1923 main gaanv main makaan banane kii vajah se lekhak karjon ke boj main dab gaya or aatmahatya kii sochane laga
 His publisher proposed to hire a clerk, but did not consider himself a self-respecting writer

 And after ten years started writing novels again
 1931 main ‘mad siljaa’ upanyaas kaa angreji main anuwaad hua to unki khyaati raaton-raat antarrashtriya str par fail gai
 After reading this epic story of the struggle of a peasant woman, many critics called Silampa deserving the Nobel Prize
 1932 main ‘da ve of e main’ main silampa ne ek adarsh kisaan yuvak kaa khubasurat chithran kiya, jise germany main yuvak kii sharabnoshi kii vajah se pratibandhit kar diya gaya, kyonki koi arya kisaan sharaab piye yah naaji sarkaar ko gavaara nahin tha
 His most important novel came in 1934 as 'people in the Summer Night', depicting the life of a community living in a particular region
 1936 main helsinki vishvavidhyalay ne silampa ko maanad doctoret kii oopaadhi pradaan kii
 In fact, the Suomi language also became known globally for the first time when Silampa was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1939

 In terms of Silampa, this award was also a miracle like his miraculous life

 When the threat of world war began to appear in 1939, this sensitive writer was very distracted and could not stop himself
