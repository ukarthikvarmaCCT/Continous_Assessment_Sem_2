 bataa den ki kisi bhi grahan ko yun to log abhishpt maanate hai, lekin elahabaad ke log chandragrahan ko abhishpt ke bajaae faldaayi bataate hai
 Mahant Anand Giri of Niranjani Akhara will be the biggest Chandragrahanfaladai
 zyaadaatar logon ko unke kundali ke hisaab se iskaa prabhaav dekhne ko milegaa lekin yah acha hoga
 The temples of all temples were closed, assuming the first sutak of lunar eclipse
 sutak chandragrahan ke 9 ghante pehle hota he
 When the doors of all temples are closed
 haalanki shraddhalu mandiron main bhi darshan karte hansangam kinarebade hanuman ke mandir 'india today' kii team ko kai aise shraddhalu mili jo band mandir me bhi shraddha se apana maathaa tech rahe the
 However, the temple of Bade Hanuman along the Sangam was closed at 2 pm
 shaam ko sangam par hone vaali aarti din main 12:30 baje kar lee gai kyonki chandragrahan ke kareeb 9 ghante pehle koi puja paath yaa anushthan nahin hota
 The water level of the Ganges is rising at the confluence
 ganga ke kinare saikadon kii taadaad main log chandragrahan ke vakt sadhana karenge or chandragrahan khatm hote hi sangam main snaan karenge
 But this lunar eclipse will be amazing for astronomers and for scientists

 is pad par niyuktisanyukt rashtramanvadhikaar samiti (yuanechaaar) kii ore se kisi swatantra maanavadhikaar visheshgy kii hi kii jaati he
 This report has been made on the basis of the report given in 2017 in UN Resolution by various countries on racism, racial discrimination, dislike of foreigners and intolerance
 apane report main echumi ne kaha ki hindu rashtravaadi party bhartiya janata party (bijpi) kii jeet ko daliton, muslimon, adivasee or isai samaaj ke khilaaf hinsa se joda jaataa he
 There have been provocative statements made by BJP leaders against minority communities, which targeted Muslims and Dalits
 yah report rashtrawaad kii lokapriyata kii maanavadhikaron ke liye chunauti ke siddhant par taiyaar kiya gaya he
 The report said that promoting discrimination, advancing discrimination increases racial discrimination and exclusion of people
 muslimon or daliton par hamale ke atirikt specialauenreporter ne vivaadit neshnal register of citigens (enarasi) kaa zikr kiya jisamen unhone kaha ki kai deshon main rashtravaadi dal avaidh apravasana maamle main prashasnic sudhaar lekar aae jisamen aadhikarik naagarik register se alpsankhyak grupon ko baahar kar diya gaya
 The Special Reporter also mentioned that in May this year he had written a letter to the Government of India in which he had raised the NRC case
 report main unhone assam main rahane vaale 'bengali muslim alpsankhyakon' kii samasya kaa zikr kiya jinhen aitihaasik rup main 'videshi' qaraar diya jaataa rahaa he
 The report also said that their names are included in the Election Commission's voter list but missing from NRC is disappointing
 saath hi yah bhi kaha gaya ki 1997 main bhi is prakriya ko apanaaya gaya tha, jisaki vajah se badi sankhya main assam main bengali musalamaanon ke adhikaar chale gaye the
 Questioning the role of the local administration, it was feared that it deliberately kept away many Muslim people and Bengali-speaking people so that they could be kept out of the updated NRC register

 In this case, Jayanti openly protested

 He later withdrew his case
 ab police donon aropiyon kii talash kar rahi he
 Till the betel nut killer and Manisha get into the hands of the police
 tab tak police chhabil patel ke khilaaf hatya kaa aarope sabit nahin kar paaegi

 mahilaon ko lekar ek aam dharna yah he ki mahilane purushon ke paise or luks se jaldi prabhavit hoti hai
 If you think so, then you are probably wrong

 According to the report, this number is increasing every day
 report ke anusaar zyada padhi-likhi or maansik taur par majboot mahilaon kii shaadi main vakt lagata he
 According to another recent research report, there are more problems in the marriage of women who are more qualified
 yah relationships tuutane kii bhi badi vajah he
 Men want women to know about romance, in order to avoid the awkwardness and to ignore such situations, women are getting ready to live with men who are less educated and weaker than they are

 china kii sarkari media ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki bhartiya soshal media par china main bane saamaan ke bahishkaar ke liye kiya gaya aahvaan bhadakaau he, kyonki bhartiya utpaada china ke utpaadon ke mukaable main tik nahin sakate
 a sharp article published in 'global Times' has targeted India fiercely
 isamen kaha gaya he ki bharat keval 'bhunk' saktaa he, donon deshon ke badhate vyapaar ghate ke bare main kuch kar nahin saktaa
 China's persistent opposition to India's efforts to make Pakistan-based terrorists international terror has angered many Indians
 aise logon ne chini utpaadon ke bahishkaar kaa aahvaan kiya he
 The newspaper has described Prime Minister Narendra Modi's favorite project 'make in India' as 'impractical'
 dainik nechin kii companiyonko bharat main nivesh nahin karne ko kaha he
 It has warned that investment will be 'suicidal' in a country where corruption is high and the working people are not hardworking
 'bharat main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa'lekh main kaha gaya he ki haal main bhartiya media ke saath-saathsoshal mediaper bhi china ke utpaadon ke bahishkaar ke bare main bahut sari baaten hui hai
 It is just a fire
 lekh ke anusaar, 'bhartiya utpaada vibhinn kaarnon se china ke utpaadon ke saath mukaable main tik hi nahin sakate
 The newspaper has said that India has yet to build roads, highways
 uske paas bijli or pani kii bahut kami he
 The worst case is that corruption is dominated in every department of the government from top to bottom
 'america kisi kaa dost nahin'akhbaar ne america ko rijhaane ko lekar bharat kii kadi aalochana kii he
 The newspaper has said that America is nobody's friend
 america sirf china ko gherne ke liye bharat ko dulaar rahe hai
 This is because the US is jealous of China's global power and its development
 lekh ke anusaar, 'bharat ke paas kaaphi paisa he, lekin adhikansh paisa rajanetaaon, afasaron or unke kuch antarang puunjipatiyon ke paas he
 The elite class of India does not want to spend the money in the country, which is actually taxpayers' money
 uski jagah bhartiya santhaan us paise kaa apane vyaktigat upbhog ke liye istemaal karte hai
 The 'indian working class is hardworking and not efficient', the newspaper said, for the same reason that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has started impractical schemes like Make in India, which is why Indian institutions want foreign companies to invest in India
 akhbaar ne kaha he ki bharat main nirmaan pariyojnaayen shuru kar vahaan nivesh karnaa china kii companiyon ke liye puri tarah se aatmghaatee hoga
 The working class of India is not hardworking and efficient
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki bharat main dukaane kholane kii jagah china kii companiyon ko china main hi apni nirmaan ikaiyaan lagaani chahie
 'indians can't do anything' Huawei, the world's third-largest manufacturer of smartphones, set up its manufacturing unit in India only last month
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi haal main bhartiya vyapaaree chini utpaadon ko kharidne or unhen bharat main bechney ke liye badi sankhya main china aate hai
 This method is favorable to China, so why ruin this system by wasting money by setting up factories in India? The newspaper wrote that let the Indian authorities bark about the growing trade deficit with China
 maamle kii sachai yahi he ki ve iske bare main kuch nahin kar sakate

 According to the victim's statement, "he promised to marry me and drove away and brought him to a relative in Faridabad

 But when some of the people living in Kanishka Residency came to know about the incident, they asked 52-year-old security guard Ramayana Gupta to go with the rickshaw to find the boy with whom she came here

 Both were then brought back to Kanishka Residency

 Meanwhile, the West Bengal Police, taking action on the FIR registered, has left for Faridabad to arrest the boy

 gujarat aties ne antarrashtriya drugs mafia or purv vidhayak bhavsingh rathod ke faraar bete kishor singh rathod ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Drug mafia teenager was arrested from rajasthan-madhya Pradesh border on Monday morning
 aties pichley kaaphi vakt se kishor singh kii talash main juty thi
 The ATS team was informed that the kids mafiakishore Singh Rathore is going to come on the border, so the ATS team was keeping a close watch on the border for the last 15 days

 bataate chalem ki is cese main gujarat aties 4 logon ko pehle hi giraftaar kar chuki he
 The University Series will continue to return slowly
 27 ank par hamane choda tha, ab 28wein se shuru kar rahaa hum jo yahaan se nae tareeke se chalegi
 a leader has said that Hindus will have to sacrifice for the temple
 us netaa ne kab kaha ki hinduon ke padhai likhaai aspataal ke liye ham pratinidhi shahadat denge
 Do you think that the people of good houses will go in this martyrdom
 is sawaal se kyon shuru kar rahaa hum
 i am doing this because you go to any government college in your city and see what is the condition of writing education there
 meraa ek hi sawaal he
 The child has to be a doctor or a rioter
 faisla aapako karnaa he
 There is no college of any kind running in any town today
 tis par netaaon ko itnaa aatmavishvaas he ki padhai likhaai par koun vot detaa he
 The youth are not able to read, so they should be prepared for the martyrdom of the temple
 rajyasabha main kanimoi ne sarkaar se ek sawaal poocha or ye khabar har akhbaar main chhapi he
 On 14 March, Minister of State for Home Affairs in the Rajya Sabha Hansraj Ahir answered the question of M
 Kanimozhi, MP from Tamil Nadu
 - 2014 se 2016 ke bich 26,500 chaatro ne aatm hatya kii he
 - There is news of a student committing suicide every hour in India - grih rajya mantri ne kaha he ki har saal yah sankhya badhati ja rahi he - 8,068 students committed suicide across India in 2014 - 2015 main bharat bhar main 8,934 chaatro ne aatm hatya kii - 9,474 students committed suicide across India in 2016 to un saansad ji ko pataa nahin he ki aapke bachche shahadat de hi rahe hai
 In the country where 26,500 young people commit suicide in three years, mps in that country should say that Hindus have to be martyred for the temple, you have to decide what you have to do
 vaise thodaa pataa kijiega dangon main kinake bachche marate hai
 Leaders do not die, children from poor and ordinary families die
 chaahe wo hindu hon chaahe wo musalmaan hon
 The leader then becomes an MP, becomes an MLA by giving fake speeches after the riots
 to aap tay kiijie ki aapako kis liye shahadat deni he
 The return of the university series will also continue because nobody has made a difference after showing 27 episodes because the leaders are sure that you understand the meaning of any government which does not work, but whose leaders day and night statements around Hindu Muslim topics Keep giving to aap ek kaam kiijie, apane shahar ke kisi bhi college main jaaiye dekhie ki vahaan building ke alaava kya he
 Are there enough teachers to teach? 30 se 40 pratishat shikshak har jagah nahin milenge, kahin-kahin to pachaas se saath fisadi shikshak nahin hai
 Whenever we hear about the privatization of education or the increase in fees or absence of teacher, we feel what it is about us
 yah jaanate hue bhi ki iskaa nuksaan paise waalon ke bachche nahin, aap madhyam shrenee or garib pariwaron ke bacchon ko uthaanaa hoga
 In the buses of Delhi, in the middle of the morning traveling between the home office, you must have calculated that by cutting the stomach, you save money so that my child can do something good with you and bring some prosperity in your life
 dahi bhalla bechate hue yah to sochate hi honge ki bas bie paas kar jaae or betaa yaa beti afasari kaa imtahaan dene lage
 While selling egg sorbet, it would be a thought that the only way to avoid the situation you are going through is that your child should complete college
 auto chalaane se lekar ola or ubar kii car chalaate chalaate aap das se baarah ghante kaa dard sah lete hai taaki do paise batch jaaen to baccha college se padhakar aapse acchhee zindagi kii taraf prasthaan kare
 The debate about the privatization of education does not reach people like you, to be honest, we do not reach even many of the journalists even though their children are going to the same government college which has low fees
 aap sabhi garib or saadhaaran parivaar ke mehanatakash or eemaandaar log hai
 Most people from your background are unable to reach a better life opportunity than you
 ab sarkari college main fees kam thi magar chupake se teacher gaayab kar die gaye
 i went to college but returned after turning around
 ab fees badhane lagi he
 Due to this, the children of poor and lower middle class college will not be able to get good education
 aapane do saal pehle suna hoga ki maharashtra ke sholapur se cycle mistre kaa betaa iees afasar ban gaya
 In 2007, Govind Jaiswal, son of a rickshawman from Banaras, became IAS
 vaise to zyaadaatar garib ke bachche garib hi rah jate hai magar ekaadh isliye safal ho pate hai ki college kii shiksha sasti he
 Now that it will continue to get expensive and you will leave this debate and continue to be caught in Hindu Muslim, then a percent chance of your child becoming IAS will also end
 balki ho chukaa he
 So when the hostel fees are expensive, college fees become very expensive and the cost of each farm increases from GST to 500 to 1000, then understand that the chances of your child moving forward are reduced
 america or britain kii acchhee or mahangi uniwarsity main padhane vaale bachche paise vaale pariwaron ke hi hote hai
 Poor and hard working people cannot even dream of teaching their children
 kya aap chaahate hai ki bina kisi bahes ke, bina aapaki jaankaree ke bharat main yah halaat ho jaae
 It has been done, but how long will you run from this debate
 isliye jab dilli vishvavidhyalay or jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke shikshak or chaatr jab nijeekaran or fees ko lekar sadak par utren to aap gaur se suniye
 What are the things happening jawahar laal nehru uniwarsity ke shikshak sangh ne aaj se satyagrah shuru kiya he
 They say that seats for m Phil and phd have been reduced due to which the way for OBC, SC and ST students to reach higher education has been closed
 jeenyu main ek system tha, pichde ilaakon se aane vaale saadhaaran chaatro ko alag se ank miltaa tha taaki ve mahanagaron ke chaatro ke saath barabari kar saken or jeenyu jaise vishvavidhyalay main sirf amir or dilli mumbai ke chaatr na padhein balki baliya, devaria, dumka, gumla, samastipur, baxur, neemuch, sikar, solan, pithauragarh ke chaatr bhi yahaan aa saken
 The teachers' union alleges that teachers are not included in the decisions taken now
 achaanak 14 march ko saat centre ke adhyakshon ko unke pad se hataa diya gaya kyonki unhone atendence ko anivaary kiye jane ke faisle kaa virodh kiya tha
 Should teachers keep their opinion, they should be punished for that
 em phil or piechdi main class nahin hoti he, chaatr ko apane ilaake main gum kar shodh karnaa hota he to uskaa atendence kyon hona chahie
 What is going to be achieved from this event? yah itnaa bada formula he to desh ke tamaam collejon main teacher kaa atendence kam kyon he
 Why are there no teachers? piechdi kaa chaatr 20 saal kaa nahin hota he
 He has to go to the library in connection with research, sometimes he has to visit someone else
 uniwarsity ne faisla kiya kiya atendence anivaary hoga
 But if anyone objectes to this decision, should he hand over the order to be removed at ten in the night
 itihaas vibhaag kii professor sucheta mahajan ko virodh karne ke kaaran pad se hataa diya gaya
 If this is the right side then we should do one thing
 samvidhan main sanshodhan kar bharat main sawaal poochne ko gaiyr kanoonee ghoshit kar dena chahie or nahin poochne par das hazaar kaa maheene kaa scolership milanaa chahie
 There should be some price to keep quiet
 ham is level par aa chuke hai
 The editor leaves the job when asked, the professor is removed at ten at night
 dilli vishwavidayalay ke shikshak bhi 19 se 23 march tak ke liye hadtaal par hai
 On March 19, he gathered at the arts faculty at North Campus and marched from there, staged a sit-in
 mudda yah he ki sarkaar ne ek niti banaai he ki college apana tees fisadi fund khud jutaayenge
 The government has created a new institution called HEFA, which is full name Higher Education Funding Agency
 college yaa uniwarsity ko ab isse karz lenaa hoga
 Not only Delhi University, IIT has also said that if the government gives loan instead of money, then it will affect the students
 fees mahangi ho jaaegi
 Maheshwar Perry said that due to this, the fees of two years of iims have reached 15 lakhs today, compared to only two lakhs a few years ago
 kya aap apane bacchon kii padhai kii fees is had tak mahangi hone dena chahenge
 If the institutions continue to repay the government by taking loans from the government itself, then they will not be able to spend on the students' projects
 dilli vishvavidlaay shikshak sangh bhi is hepha ko lekar etraz jataa rahaa he
 He says that higher education will become expensive
 pehle vishvavidhyalay, iaiti yaa im sarkaar ko prastaav bhejte the or sarkaar paisa bhej detii thi ki padhai likhaai main koi kami nahin rahani chahie
 Now they have to take a loan
 agar shiksha mahangi hogi to aam bharatiyon ke bachche kya 15 lakh yaa do lakh kii fees dekar pard paaenge
 Protests are taking place about this
 pension kaa bhi masalaa bahut gambhir he
 Many teachers have not received pension
 jabaki ritair hue kaaphi vakt guzar gaya he
 The new pension policy is being opposed
 duuta ke virodh kaa ek or masalaa he
 It is a bit complicated but the feeling is that through this, the way for Dalit and tribal students to come is being narrowed
 shikshakon kaa kahana he ki aarakshan niti main badlaav kiya ja rahaa he
 The roster is being changed for this
 inkaa kahana he ki iske kaaran dalit or adivasee chaatro kaa lekturer or professor ke pad par pahunchnaa pehle se bhi mushkil ho jayega
 Rajesh Jha, a member of the executive council of the university, says that the reserved category will be reduced by 25 percent
 isse jo log edaha par varshon se padhaa rahe hai, naukari milane kii unki sambhaavna bhi samaapt ho jaaegi
 You know that there are several thousand temporary teachers teaching in DU
 kaayade se in sabhi ko permanent kar dena chahie magar kam ko karnaa pade iskaa rasta nikaala ja rahaa he
 Is it not so, then do not answer this, when teachers are vacant in DU, then who is teaching your children in college of other cities, teacher or wall, or reading the leader's slogan on youth hoarding
 Have been
 slogan main swarg nahin hota he
 Simple question, the positions are vacant, there are children in the class, so why are the teachers not permanent? is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin he tabhi is tarah ke bayaan aate hai ki mandir ke liye shahadat dene kaa time aa gaya he
 If the colleges are forced to raise 30 per cent of the funds, then the fees are going to increase significantly
 akhabaaron main daawa kiya jaataa rahata he ki jiesti ke kaaran tex collection bad gaya he
 The government's earnings have increased, then why is that income not being spent on writing? phir bajet kyon kam ho rahaa he
 Is the claim not correct? aap in shikshakon ko left rhite ke khaanche main mat dekhie
 Their questions will affect you more
 rahi baat left rhite kii to rhite vaale bhi ro rahe hai
 Many of those who raised slogans, wearing masks, are not being pranked
 ab ve kah nahin sakate magar inbox main messej bhejte hai ki hamaara ishyu uthaa dijie, kya pataa naukari mil jaae
 The intention is that the arrangements for the ruin of the children of the ordinary family have been completed
 eemaandaar daaroga, tehseeldaar, beldaar, ejeeniyar, skool ke shikshak, bank ke clerk, 20-30 hazaar kamaane vaale log apane bacchon ko acchhee or sasti shiksha nahin de paaenge
 In many universities of Bihar, the BA session is going on for two to three years
 agar aap apane bacchon ko barbaad hote dekhnaa chaahate hai ki to unka daakhila bihar ke bean mandal uniwarsity, magadh uniwarsity, bi aar ambedkar bihar uniwarsity, jaiprakash narayan uniwarsity main kara dijie
 There, the formula for getting a three-year BA in five to seven years is patented
 noujvaan college se nikalegaa hi nahin to berojgaar hokar baahar ghoomegaa hi nahin
 The youth of Bihar have also accepted this
 bihar, upi, madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh or jharkhand main ek college kaa naam bataa dijie jo dhang se chal rahaa ho, jahaan yogya or saare shikshak hon
 Quaid should have asked the name of twenty colleges, but he would not be able to name one
 isliye agar aapke bachche barbaad ho chuke hai to unhen mandir kii shahadat ke liye bhej dijie, saansad ji unka intazaar kar rahe hai
 i remember the statement made by the Prime Minister at Patna University
 pichley saal patna uniwarsity ke 100 saal hone par unhone kaha tha ki das privet or das sarkari uniwarsity ko duniya kii chotii kii 100 uniwarsity main pahunchane ke liye paanch saal main 10,000 karod die jaaenge
 The idea was introduced in the 2016-17 budget
 us bajet main iske liye koi paisa nahin dikhaa
 50 crore was mentioned on the 2017-18 budget expenditure page
 dekar aae the 50 karod or dene kii baat kar rahe the 10,000 karod
 In the budget of 2018-19, 250 crore has been written in front of creating a world class institution
 uske pehle ke bajet main aapane suna ki maatr 50 karod likhaa he
 In two years, the reference of 300 million rupees is found in the budget
 jabaki baat hui he ki paanch saal main 10,000 karod die jaaenge
 This will be known only when you change the way you read newspapers and watch TV
 zaruuratein bad gayi hai magar bajet kam hota ja rahaa he
 It is said that by increasing some percentage, it has increased but in reality there is a lot of decrease
 aap kah sakate hai ki jab whatsap uniwarsity or news channelon se hi vigyaan or itihaas padhanaa he to phir college par paise karch kyon kiye jaaen
 By the way, while the teachers of DUTA were demonstrating, the students of the Open School of Education of Delhi University also came to blow the effigy
 inaki maang he ki abhi tak inke paas course material nahin pahunchaa he
 The School of Open Learning also has five lakh students
 in chaatro ko november ke baad duusare or tisare varsh kaa study material mila he jabaki satr to july se hi shuru ho jaataa he
 They are to be tested in May
 bina kitaab padhe ye pariksha kaise denge to putala phoonk rahe hai
 Not knowing in the name of Hindi, how many ministers come and go on the channels, but these students say that students of Hindi medium are also being given study material in English
 jiskaa study material nahin mil rahaa he us vishay ko shikshak bhi nahin padhaa rahe hai
 And it has been written in the study material that you check whether the given material is in your syllabus or not
 ye dilli vishvavidhyalay kaa haal he, to kasbon or rajyon kii rajdhaniyon main kya haal hoga
 After all, how are we tolerating how the b
ed
 education session can be delayed by one year and two years
 agra ke dow
 a letter from a student of Bhim Rao Ambedkar University has arrived
 aap bhi pard len
 
 
 The comments raveesh sar, ham log upi ke dow
 Bhim Rao Ambedkar Vishwavidyalaya is a student of SED 2015-17 b
ed year course in Agra, although we should have got the exam and result by june-july 2017 but due to the negligence of the university, we will be in second year or final year examination
 It was concluded in the last week of December 2017
 isaki prayogtmak pariksha farvari 2018 main hui lekin abhi tak parinaam nahin aayaa he
 There is a vacancy of LT grade in UP Public Service Commission, in which we also have to join but due to lack of results, the future of thousands of students is in balance
 vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati or pariksha niyantrak ko bhi mail kiya gaya he lekin koi parinaam nahin niklaa he
 The result of second university students of b
ed session 2015-17 has come only in July or August 2017
 sar aap naukari ke prime time sho par ek baar bol dijie
 Perhaps the chancellor of the University and the Controller of Examinations can understand something
 agar inke kamare main ledar kii kursi he or us par safed tauliya he to inhen kabhi samaj nahin aayega ki hazaron chaatro kii zindagi se khilne kaa dard kya hota he
 If one of these students also had a future ruined, missed any job opportunity then who would be responsible
 - 2014 se 2016 ke bich 26,500 chaatro ne aatm hatya kii he
 - There is news of a student committing suicide every hour in India - grih rajya mantri ne kaha he ki har saal yah sankhya badhati ja rahi he - 8,068 students committed suicide across India in 2014 - 2015 main bharat bhar main 8,934 chaatro ne aatm hatya kii - 9,474 students committed suicide across India in 2016 to un saansad ji ko pataa nahin he ki aapke bachche shahadat de hi rahe hai

 dilli kii bason main aap subah shaam ghar daftar ke bich yatra main yah to hisaab karte hi honge ki pet kaat kar paise bachaa lete hai taaki meraa baccha aapse kuch acha kar jaae or aapke jivan main thodi samruddhi aa jaae
 While selling Dahi Bhalla, they must have thought that they should just pass BA and the son or daughter started examining the officer
 bel kaa sherbet to kabhi anda bechate hue yah khyaal to aata hi hoga ki jis sthiti se aap guzar rahe hai usase bachane kaa ek hi tarika he ki aapkaa baccha college kii padhai puri kar le
 From driving an auto to driving an Ola and Uber car, you bear the pain of ten to twelve hours so that if you save two money, then the child will go from college to your good life
 aap jaise logon tak shiksha ke nijeekaran kii bahes nahin pahunchati he, sach puuchhie to ham patrakaron main se bhi bahuton tak nahin pahunchati jabaki unke bachche bhi usee sarkari college main jane vaale hai jisaki fees kam he
 You are all hard working and honest people of poor and ordinary family
 zyaadaatar aapaki prishthbhumi ke log aapse behatar zindagi ke avasar tak nahin pahunch pate hai
 Now the fees in the government college were low but secretly the teacher disappeared
 college to gaya magar gum phir kar laut aayaa
 Now the fees have started increasing
 isse hoga yah college kii padhai garib or nimna madhyamvarg pariwaron ke bachche acchhee shiksha hasil nahin kar paaenge
 You must have heard two years ago that the son of a bicycle mistry became an IAS officer from Solapur, Maharashtra
 2007 main banaras ke ek rickshaw vaale kaa betaa govind jaisawal iees ban gaya
 Although most of the poor children remain poor, but few are able to succeed because college education is cheap
 ab jab yah mahangi hoti chali jaaegi or aap is bahes ko chhodkar hindu muslim main hi fansaae jate rahenge to aapke bachche ke iees banane kaa ek percent chance bhi khatm ho jayega
 Rather it has happened
 isliye jab hostal kii fees mahangi ho, college kii fees bahut mahangi ho jaae or har farm kii keemat jiesti lagaatar 500 se 1000 ho jaae to samajhie ki aapke bachche ke liye aage badhane ke maukey kam ho gaye
 Children studying in good and expensive universities in USA and UK belong to families with money
 garib or mehnat mazaduri kar apane bacchon ko padhaane kaa sapana tak nahin dekh pate
 Do you want this situation to happen in India without any debate, without your knowledge
 ho to gaya he vaise lekin aap kab tak is bahes se bhaagenge
 So, when teachers and students of Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University get on the road about privatization and fees, then you listen carefully
 kya baaten ho rahi hai
 Teachers Association of Jawaharlal Nehru University has started Satyagraha from today
 inkaa kahana he ki em phil or piechdi ke liye seat kam kar di gai he jiske kaaran obisi, anusuchit jati or janajati ke chaatro kaa ucchtam shiksha tak pahunchane kaa rasta band ho gaya he
 JNU had a system, ordinary students coming from backward areas used to get separate marks so that they could compete with the students of the metros and in a university like JNU, not only the rich and Delhi students of Mumbai read but Ballia, Deoria, Dumka, Students of Gumla, Samastipur, Buxar, Neemuch, Sikar, Solan, Pithoragarh can also come here
 shikshak sangh kaa aarope he ki ab jo faisle liye jate hai usamen shikshakon ko shaamil nahin kiya jaataa he
 Suddenly on 14 March, the presidents of seven centers were removed from their posts as they opposed the decision to make the attendance mandatory
 kya shikshak apana mat rakhenge to uske liye unhen sazaa milani chahie
 There is no class in m phil and phd, the student has to do research in his area and then why should he attend
 is atendence se aakhir hasil kya hone vaala he
 This is such a big formula, so why is there less teacher attendance in all the colleges of the country
 teacher kyon nahin hai
 a phd student is not 20 years old
 use research ke silsile main kabhi librari janaa hota he to kabhi kisi or se milane janaa hota he
 The university decided that attendance will be mandatory
 lekin agar koi is faisle par etraz jataae to kya use raat ke das baje hataa dene kaa order thama dena chahie
 Professor Sucheta Mahajan of the Department of History was removed from the post due to protests
 agar yahi sahi paksh he to hamen ek kaam karnaa chahie
 Amending the constitution, asking questions in India should be declared illegal and if not asked, scholarship of ten thousand months should be awarded
 chup rahane kii kuch to keemat mili
 We have come to this level
 poochne par sampadak kii naukari chali jaati he, poochne par professor ko raat das baje hataa diya jaataa he
 Teachers of Delhi University are also on strike from 19 to 23 March
 19 march ko north campus ke arts faikalti main jamaa hue or vahaan se march kiya, dharna diya
 The point is that the government has formulated a policy that colleges will raise thirty percent of their own funds
 sarkaar ne HEFA naam kii nai sanstha banaai he jiskaa puraa naam he hair ajukeshan funding agency
 The college or university will now have to borrow from it
 dilli vishvavidhyalay hi nahin, iaiti ne bhi kaha he ki agar sarkaar paise kii jagah lone degi to iskaa asar chaatro par padegaa
 The fees will be expensive
 maheshwar peri ne bataaya ki iske kaaran aaj im ke do saal kii fees 15 lakh tak pahunch gai he, jabaki kuch saal pehle maatr do lakh thi
 Would you like to let your children's education fees become expensive to such an extent
 agar santhaan sarkaar se hi lone lekar sarkaar ko chukaate rahenge to chaatro ke project par karch nahin kar paaenge
 The Delhi University Teachers Association is also expressing reservations about this hefa
 unka kahana he ki ucch shiksha mahangi ho jaaegi
 Earlier universities, iits or iims used to send proposals to the government and the government used to send money that there should be no shortage of writing
 ab unhen lone lenaa pad rahaa he
 If education will be expensive, then the children of ordinary Indians will be able to study by paying a fee of 15 lakhs or two lakhs
 isi ko lekar virodh pradarshan ho rahaa he
 The issue of pension is also very serious
 bahut se shikshakon ko pension nahin mila he
 While much time has passed since he retired
 nai pension niti kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 There is another issue of opposition to Duta
 yah thodaa jatil he magar bhav yah he ki iske zarie dalit or adivasee chaatro ko aane kaa rasta sankara kiya ja rahaa he
 The teachers say that the reservation policy is being changed
 iske liye roster ko badla ja rahaa he
 They say that this will make it even more difficult for Dalit and tribal students to reach the position of lecturer and professor
 vishvavidhyalay ke kaaryakari parishad ke sadsy rajesh jha kaa kahana he ki arakshit varg main 25 pratishat siten kam ho jaaengi
 With this, people who have been teaching on Adahak for years will also lose their chances of getting a job
 aap jaanate hai ki diu main kai hazaar asthaayee shikshak padhaa rahe hai
 Ideally, all of them should be permanent, but less has to be done to find a way out of it
 kya aisa he, aisa nahin he to isi kaa jawaab de dijie ki jab diu main shikshakon ke pad khaali hai to baaki shaharon ke college main aapke bacchon ko padhaa koun rahaa he, teacher yaa diwaar, yaa noujvaan hording par netaa ji kaa slogan hi pard rahe hai
 Slogan does not have heaven
 simpal sawaal he, pad khaali hai, class main bachche hai to shikshak permanent kyon nahin hai
 There is no answer to this question, then only such statements come that the time has come for martyrdom for the temple
 agar collejon par 30 fisadi fund jutaney kaa dabaav daalaa jayega to fees kaaphi badhane ja rahi he
 It is claimed in the newspapers that tax collection has increased due to GST
 sarkaar kii kamai bad gai he phir us kamai ko padhai likhaai par kyon nahin karch kiya ja rahaa he
 Then why is the budget being reduced
 kya daawa sahi nahin he
 Do not see these teachers in the left right slot
 inke jo sawaal hai uskaa asar aap par zyaada padegaa
 It is a matter of left right and right ones are also crying
 jinhone naare lagaae, mukhute pahane unamem se bhi bahuton kaa permanent nahin ho rahaa he
 Now they cannot say, but send messages in the inbox to take up our issue, do you know how to get a job
 aashay yah he ki saadhaaran parivaar ke bacchon ke barbaad hone kaa intazaam puraa ho chukaa he
 Honest daroga, tehsildar, belladar, engineer, school teacher, bank clerk, people earning 20-30 thousand will not be able to give good and cheap education to their children
 bihar ke kai vishvavidhyalayon main bie kaa seshan do se teen saal let chal rahaa he
 If you want to see your children ruined, then get them enrolled in Bihar's BN Mandal University, Magadh University, BR Ambedkar Bihar University, Jayaprakash Narayan University
 vahaan teen saal kaa bie paanch se saat saal main karaae jane kaa formula patent hua he
 The young man will not come out of college, otherwise he will not go out unemployed
 bihar ke naujavaanon ne ise sweekaar bhi kar liya he
 Name a college in Bihar, UP, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand which is running properly, where there are qualified and all teachers
 kaayade se bees college kaa naam poochna chahie tha magar ek kaa naam nahin bataa paaenge ye
 Therefore, if your children are ruined, then send them for the martyrdom of the temple, the MP is waiting for them
 pradhanmantri kaa patna uniwarsity main diya bayaan mujhe yaad he
 Last year, when Patna University turned 100, he said that 10,000 crore would be given in five years to bring ten private and ten government universities to the top 100 universities in the world
 2016-17 ke bajet main is idia kaa aagaman hua tha
 No money was shown for it in that budget
 2017-18 ke bajet ke expendichar pej par iske liye 50 karod kaa zikr mila
 50 crores came from giving and 10,000 crores was talking about giving
 2018-19 ke bajet main vishwa stareey santhaan banane ke saamne 250 karod likhaa he
 In his earlier budget, you heard that he has written only 50 crores
 do saal main koi 300 karod kaa zikr bajet main miltaa he
 While there has been talk that 10,000 crores will be given in five years
 yah sab tabhi pataa chalegaa jab aap akhbaar padhane or tivi dekhne kaa tarika badalenge
 The needs have increased but the budget is becoming less
 kuch pratishat badhaakar bataaya jaataa he ki badha he magar vaastavik rup se bahut kami aa rahi he
 You can say that when you want to study science and history from whatsapp University and news channels then why spend money on college
 vaise jab duuta ke shikshak pradarshan kar rahe the tab dilli vishvavidhyalay ke mukt shiksha vidhyalay ke chaatr bhi putala lekar foonkane aa gaye the
 They demand that they have not yet reached the course material
 skool of open larning main bhi paanch lakh chaatr hai
 These students have got second and third year study material after November, while the session starts from July itself
 may main inaki pariksha honi he
 Without reading a book, how are you going to give this exam, then you are blowing the effigy
 hindi ke naam par na jane kitne mantri channelon par aakar bavaal kar den magar in chaatro kaa kahana he ki hindi madhyam ke chaatro ko bhi kuch vishay kii adhyayan saamagree angrezi main di ja rahi he
 Teachers who are not getting study material are not even teaching that subject
 or study material main likhaa gaya he ki aap jaanch len ki di gai saamagree aapke silebus main he yaa nahin
 This is the condition of Delhi University, so what will happen in the towns and state capitals
 aakhir ham bardaasht kaise kar rahe hai ki bied kii padhai kaa satr ek saal or do saal deree se kaise chal saktaa he
 Dr

 Sir, please speak once on the prime time show of jobs
 shaayad vishvividlayay ke kulapati or pariksha niyantrak ko kuch samaj aa sake
 If they have a leather chair in their room and a white towel on it, then they will never understand what is the pain of playing with the lives of thousands of students
 agar in chaatro main se ek kaa bhi bhavishya barbaad hua, naukari ke avasar se koi chook gaya to koun zimmedaar hoga
 So when the hostel fees are expensive, college fees become very expensive and the cost of each farm increases from GST to 500 to 1000, then understand that the chances of your child moving forward are reduced
 america or britain kii acchhee or mahangi uniwarsity main padhane vaale bachche paise vaale pariwaron ke hi hote hai
 Poor and hard working people cannot even dream of teaching their children
 kya aap chaahate hai ki bina kisi bahes ke, bina aapaki jaankaree ke bharat main yah halaat ho jaae
 It has been done, but how long will you run from this debate
 isliye jab dilli vishvavidhyalay or jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke shikshak or chaatr jab nijeekaran or fees ko lekar sadak par utren to aap gaur se suniye
 What are the things happening jawahar laal nehru uniwarsity ke shikshak sangh ne aaj se satyagrah shuru kiya he
 They say that seats for m Phil and phd have been reduced due to which the way for OBC, SC and ST students to reach higher education has been closed
 jeenyu main ek system tha, pichde ilaakon se aane vaale saadhaaran chaatro ko alag se ank miltaa tha taaki ve mahanagaron ke chaatro ke saath barabari kar saken or jeenyu jaise vishvavidhyalay main sirf amir or dilli mumbai ke chaatr na padhein balki baliya, devaria, dumka, gumla, samastipur, baxur, neemuch, sikar, solan, pithauragarh ke chaatr bhi yahaan aa saken
 The teachers' union alleges that teachers are not included in the decisions taken now
 achaanak 14 march ko saat centre ke adhyakshon ko unke pad se hataa diya gaya kyonki unhone atendence ko anivaary kiye jane ke faisle kaa virodh kiya tha
 Should teachers keep their opinion, they should be punished for that
 em phil or piechdi main class nahin hoti he, chaatr ko apane ilaake main gum kar shodh karnaa hota he to uskaa atendence kyon hona chahie
 What is going to be achieved from this event? yah itnaa bada formula he to desh ke tamaam collejon main teacher kaa atendence kam kyon he
 Why are there no teachers? piechdi kaa chaatr 20 saal kaa nahin hota he
 He has to go to the library in connection with research, sometimes he has to visit someone else
 uniwarsity ne faisla kiya kiya atendence anivaary hoga
 But if anyone objectes to this decision, should he hand over the order to be removed at ten in the night
 itihaas vibhaag kii professor sucheta mahajan ko virodh karne ke kaaran pad se hataa diya gaya
 If this is the right side then we should do one thing
 samvidhan main sanshodhan kar bharat main sawaal poochne ko gaiyr kanoonee ghoshit kar dena chahie or nahin poochne par das hazaar kaa maheene kaa scolership milanaa chahie
 There should be some price to keep quiet
 ham is level par aa chuke hai
 The editor leaves the job when asked, the professor is removed at ten at night
 dilli vishwavidayalay ke shikshak bhi 19 se 23 march tak ke liye hadtaal par hai
 On March 19, he gathered at the arts faculty at North Campus and marched from there, staged a sit-in
 mudda yah he ki sarkaar ne ek niti banaai he ki college apana tees fisadi fund khud jutaayenge
 The government has created a new institution called HEFA, which is full name Higher Education Funding Agency
 college yaa uniwarsity ko ab isse karz lenaa hoga
 Not only Delhi University, IIT has also said that if the government gives loan instead of money, then it will affect the students
 fees mahangi ho jaaegi
 Maheshwar Perry said that due to this, the fees of two years of iims have reached 15 lakhs today, compared to only two lakhs a few years ago
 kya aap apane bacchon kii padhai kii fees is had tak mahangi hone dena chahenge
 If the institutions continue to repay the government by taking loans from the government itself, then they will not be able to spend on the students' projects
 dilli vishvavidlaay shikshak sangh bhi is hepha ko lekar etraz jataa rahaa he
 He says that higher education will become expensive
 pehle vishvavidhyalay, iaiti yaa im sarkaar ko prastaav bhejte the or sarkaar paisa bhej detii thi ki padhai likhaai main koi kami nahin rahani chahie
 Now they have to take a loan
 agar shiksha mahangi hogi to aam bharatiyon ke bachche kya 15 lakh yaa do lakh kii fees dekar pard paaenge
 Protests are taking place about this
 pension kaa bhi masalaa bahut gambhir he
 Many teachers have not received pension
 jabaki ritair hue kaaphi vakt guzar gaya he
 The new pension policy is being opposed
 duuta ke virodh kaa ek or masalaa he
 It is a bit complicated but the feeling is that through this, the way for Dalit and tribal students to come is being narrowed
 shikshakon kaa kahana he ki aarakshan niti main badlaav kiya ja rahaa he
 The roster is being changed for this
 inkaa kahana he ki iske kaaran dalit or adivasee chaatro kaa lekturer or professor ke pad par pahunchnaa pehle se bhi mushkil ho jayega
 Rajesh Jha, a member of the executive council of the university, says that the reserved category will be reduced by 25 percent
 isse jo log edaha par varshon se padhaa rahe hai, naukari milane kii unki sambhaavna bhi samaapt ho jaaegi
 You know that there are several thousand temporary teachers teaching in DU
 kaayade se in sabhi ko permanent kar dena chahie magar kam ko karnaa pade iskaa rasta nikaala ja rahaa he
 Is it not so, then do not answer this, when teachers are vacant in DU, then who is teaching your children in college of other cities, teacher or wall, or reading the leader's slogan on youth hoarding
 Have been
 slogan main swarg nahin hota he
 Simple question, the positions are vacant, there are children in the class, so why are the teachers not permanent? is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin he tabhi is tarah ke bayaan aate hai ki mandir ke liye shahadat dene kaa time aa gaya he
 If the colleges are forced to raise 30 per cent of the funds, then the fees are going to increase significantly
 akhabaaron main daawa kiya jaataa rahata he ki jiesti ke kaaran tex collection bad gaya he
 The government's earnings have increased, then why is that income not being spent on writing? phir bajet kyon kam ho rahaa he
 Is the claim not correct? aap in shikshakon ko left rhite ke khaanche main mat dekhie
 Their questions will affect you more
 rahi baat left rhite kii to rhite vaale bhi ro rahe hai
 Many of those who raised slogans, wearing masks, are not being pranked
 ab ve kah nahin sakate magar inbox main messej bhejte hai ki hamaara ishyu uthaa dijie, kya pataa naukari mil jaae
 The intention is that the arrangements for the ruin of the children of the ordinary family have been completed
 eemaandaar daaroga, tehseeldaar, beldaar, ejeeniyar, skool ke shikshak, bank ke clerk, 20-30 hazaar kamaane vaale log apane bacchon ko acchhee or sasti shiksha nahin de paaenge
 In many universities of Bihar, the BA session is going on for two to three years
 agar aap apane bacchon ko barbaad hote dekhnaa chaahate hai ki to unka daakhila bihar ke bean mandal uniwarsity, magadh uniwarsity, bi aar ambedkar bihar uniwarsity, jaiprakash narayan uniwarsity main kara dijie
 There, the formula for getting a three-year BA in five to seven years is patented
 noujvaan college se nikalegaa hi nahin to berojgaar hokar baahar ghoomegaa hi nahin
 The youth of Bihar have also accepted this
 bihar, upi, madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh or jharkhand main ek college kaa naam bataa dijie jo dhang se chal rahaa ho, jahaan yogya or saare shikshak hon
 Quaid should have asked the name of twenty colleges, but he would not be able to name one
 isliye agar aapke bachche barbaad ho chuke hai to unhen mandir kii shahadat ke liye bhej dijie, saansad ji unka intazaar kar rahe hai
 i remember the statement made by the Prime Minister at Patna University
 pichley saal patna uniwarsity ke 100 saal hone par unhone kaha tha ki das privet or das sarkari uniwarsity ko duniya kii chotii kii 100 uniwarsity main pahunchane ke liye paanch saal main 10,000 karod die jaaenge
 The idea was introduced in the 2016-17 budget
 us bajet main iske liye koi paisa nahin dikhaa
 50 crore was mentioned on the 2017-18 budget expenditure page
 dekar aae the 50 karod or dene kii baat kar rahe the 10,000 karod
 In the budget of 2018-19, 250 crore has been written in front of creating a world class institution
 uske pehle ke bajet main aapane suna ki maatr 50 karod likhaa he
 In two years, the reference of 300 million rupees is found in the budget
 jabaki baat hui he ki paanch saal main 10,000 karod die jaaenge
 This will be known only when you change the way you read newspapers and watch TV
 zaruuratein bad gayi hai magar bajet kam hota ja rahaa he
 It is said that by increasing some percentage, it has increased but in reality there is a lot of decrease
 aap kah sakate hai ki jab whatsap uniwarsity or news channelon se hi vigyaan or itihaas padhanaa he to phir college par paise karch kyon kiye jaaen
 By the way, while the teachers of DUTA were demonstrating, the students of the Open School of Education of Delhi University also came to blow the effigy
 inaki maang he ki abhi tak inke paas course material nahin pahunchaa he
 The School of Open Learning also has five lakh students
 in chaatro ko november ke baad duusare or tisare varsh kaa study material mila he jabaki satr to july se hi shuru ho jaataa he
 They are to be tested in May
 bina kitaab padhe ye pariksha kaise denge to putala phoonk rahe hai
 Not knowing in the name of Hindi, how many ministers come and go on the channels, but these students say that students of Hindi medium are also being given study material in English
 jiskaa study material nahin mil rahaa he us vishay ko shikshak bhi nahin padhaa rahe hai
 And it has been written in the study material that you check whether the given material is in your syllabus or not
 ye dilli vishvavidhyalay kaa haal he, to kasbon or rajyon kii rajdhaniyon main kya haal hoga
 After all, how are we tolerating how the b
ed
 education session can be delayed by one year and two years
 agra ke dow

 It was concluded in the last week of December 2017
 isaki prayogtmak pariksha farvari 2018 main hui lekin abhi tak parinaam nahin aayaa he
 There is a vacancy of LT grade in UP Public Service Commission, in which we also have to join but due to lack of results, the future of thousands of students is in balance
 vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati or pariksha niyantrak ko bhi mail kiya gaya he lekin koi parinaam nahin niklaa he
 The result of second university students of b

 Perhaps the chancellor of the University and the Controller of Examinations can understand something

 isse jo log edaha par varshon se padhaa rahe hai, naukari milane kii unki sambhaavna bhi samaapt ho jaaegi
 You know that there are several thousand temporary teachers teaching in DU
 kaayade se in sabhi ko permanent kar dena chahie magar kam ko karnaa pade iskaa rasta nikaala ja rahaa he
 Is it not so, then do not answer this, when teachers are vacant in DU, then who is teaching your children in college of other cities, teacher or wall, or reading the leader's slogan on youth hoarding
 Have been
 slogan main swarg nahin hota he
 Simple question, the positions are vacant, there are children in the class, so why are the teachers not permanent? is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin he tabhi is tarah ke bayaan aate hai ki mandir ke liye shahadat dene kaa time aa gaya he
 If the colleges are forced to raise 30 per cent of the funds, then the fees are going to increase significantly
 akhabaaron main daawa kiya jaataa rahata he ki jiesti ke kaaran tex collection bad gaya he
 The government's earnings have increased, then why is that income not being spent on writing? phir bajet kyon kam ho rahaa he
 Is the claim not correct? aap in shikshakon ko left rhite ke khaanche main mat dekhie
 Their questions will affect you more
 rahi baat left rhite kii to rhite vaale bhi ro rahe hai
 Many of those who raised slogans, wearing masks, are not being pranked
 ab ve kah nahin sakate magar inbox main messej bhejte hai ki hamaara ishyu uthaa dijie, kya pataa naukari mil jaae
 The intention is that the arrangements for the ruin of the children of the ordinary family have been completed

 In many universities of Bihar, the BA session is going on for two to three years
 agar aap apane bacchon ko barbaad hote dekhnaa chaahate hai ki to unka daakhila bihar ke bean mandal uniwarsity, magadh uniwarsity, bi aar ambedkar bihar uniwarsity, jaiprakash narayan uniwarsity main kara dijie

 isliye agar aapke bachche barbaad ho chuke hai to unhen mandir kii shahadat ke liye bhej dijie, saansad ji unka intazaar kar rahe hai
 i remember the statement made by the Prime Minister at Patna University
 pichley saal patna uniwarsity ke 100 saal hone par unhone kaha tha ki das privet or das sarkari uniwarsity ko duniya kii chotii kii 100 uniwarsity main pahunchane ke liye paanch saal main 10,000 karod die jaaenge
 The idea was introduced in the 2016-17 budget
 us bajet main iske liye koi paisa nahin dikhaa
 50 crore was mentioned on the 2017-18 budget expenditure page
 dekar aae the 50 karod or dene kii baat kar rahe the 10,000 karod
 In the budget of 2018-19, 250 crore has been written in front of creating a world class institution
 uske pehle ke bajet main aapane suna ki maatr 50 karod likhaa he
 In two years, the reference of 300 million rupees is found in the budget
 jabaki baat hui he ki paanch saal main 10,000 karod die jaaenge
 This will be known only when you change the way you read newspapers and watch TV
 zaruuratein bad gayi hai magar bajet kam hota ja rahaa he
 It is said that by increasing some percentage, it has increased but in reality there is a lot of decrease
 aap kah sakate hai ki jab whatsap uniwarsity or news channelon se hi vigyaan or itihaas padhanaa he to phir college par paise karch kyon kiye jaaen
 By the way, while the teachers of DUTA were demonstrating, the students of the Open School of Education of Delhi University also came to blow the effigy
 inaki maang he ki abhi tak inke paas course material nahin pahunchaa he
 The School of Open Learning also has five lakh students

 They are to be tested in May
 bina kitaab padhe ye pariksha kaise denge to putala phoonk rahe hai
 Not knowing in the name of Hindi, how many ministers come and go on the channels, but these students say that students of Hindi medium are also being given study material in English
 jiskaa study material nahin mil rahaa he us vishay ko shikshak bhi nahin padhaa rahe hai
 And it has been written in the study material that you check whether the given material is in your syllabus or not
 ye dilli vishvavidhyalay kaa haal he, to kasbon or rajyon kii rajdhaniyon main kya haal hoga
 After all, how are we tolerating how the b

 agra ke dow
 a letter from a student of Bhim Rao Ambedkar University has arrived
 aap bhi pard len
 
 
 The comments raveesh sar, ham log upi ke dow
 Bhim Rao Ambedkar Vishwavidyalaya is a student of SED 2015-17 b
ed year course in Agra, although we should have got the exam and result by june-july 2017 but due to the negligence of the university, we will be in second year or final year examination
 It was concluded in the last week of December 2017
 isaki prayogtmak pariksha farvari 2018 main hui lekin abhi tak parinaam nahin aayaa he
 There is a vacancy of LT grade in UP Public Service Commission, in which we also have to join but due to lack of results, the future of thousands of students is in balance
 vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati or pariksha niyantrak ko bhi mail kiya gaya he lekin koi parinaam nahin niklaa he
 The result of second university students of b
ed session 2015-17 has come only in July or August 2017
 sar aap naukari ke prime time sho par ek baar bol dijie
 Perhaps the chancellor of the University and the Controller of Examinations can understand something
 agar inke kamare main ledar kii kursi he or us par safed tauliya he to inhen kabhi samaj nahin aayega ki hazaron chaatro kii zindagi se khilne kaa dard kya hota he
 If one of these students also had a future ruined, missed any job opportunity then who would be responsible
 piechdi kaa chaatr 20 saal kaa nahin hota he
 He has to go to the library in connection with research, sometimes he has to visit someone else
 uniwarsity ne faisla kiya kiya atendence anivaary hoga
 But if anyone objectes to this decision, should he hand over the order to be removed at ten in the night
 itihaas vibhaag kii professor sucheta mahajan ko virodh karne ke kaaran pad se hataa diya gaya
 If this is the right side then we should do one thing
 samvidhan main sanshodhan kar bharat main sawaal poochne ko gaiyr kanoonee ghoshit kar dena chahie or nahin poochne par das hazaar kaa maheene kaa scolership milanaa chahie
 There should be some price to keep quiet
 ham is level par aa chuke hai
 The editor leaves the job when asked, the professor is removed at ten at night
 dilli vishwavidayalay ke shikshak bhi 19 se 23 march tak ke liye hadtaal par hai
 On March 19, he gathered at the arts faculty at North Campus and marched from there, staged a sit-in
 mudda yah he ki sarkaar ne ek niti banaai he ki college apana tees fisadi fund khud jutaayenge
 The government has created a new institution called HEFA, which is full name Higher Education Funding Agency
 college yaa uniwarsity ko ab isse karz lenaa hoga
 Not only Delhi University, IIT has also said that if the government gives loan instead of money, then it will affect the students
 fees mahangi ho jaaegi
 Maheshwar Perry said that due to this, the fees of two years of iims have reached 15 lakhs today, compared to only two lakhs a few years ago
 kya aap apane bacchon kii padhai kii fees is had tak mahangi hone dena chahenge
 If the institutions continue to repay the government by taking loans from the government itself, then they will not be able to spend on the students' projects
 dilli vishvavidlaay shikshak sangh bhi is hepha ko lekar etraz jataa rahaa he
 He says that higher education will become expensive
 pehle vishvavidhyalay, iaiti yaa im sarkaar ko prastaav bhejte the or sarkaar paisa bhej detii thi ki padhai likhaai main koi kami nahin rahani chahie
 Now they have to take a loan
 agar shiksha mahangi hogi to aam bharatiyon ke bachche kya 15 lakh yaa do lakh kii fees dekar pard paaenge
 Protests are taking place about this
 pension kaa bhi masalaa bahut gambhir he
 Many teachers have not received pension
 jabaki ritair hue kaaphi vakt guzar gaya he
 The new pension policy is being opposed
 duuta ke virodh kaa ek or masalaa he
 It is a bit complicated but the feeling is that through this, the way for Dalit and tribal students to come is being narrowed
 shikshakon kaa kahana he ki aarakshan niti main badlaav kiya ja rahaa he
 The roster is being changed for this
 inkaa kahana he ki iske kaaran dalit or adivasee chaatro kaa lekturer or professor ke pad par pahunchnaa pehle se bhi mushkil ho jayega
 Rajesh Jha, a member of the executive council of the university, says that the reserved category will be reduced by 25 percent

 If one of these students also had a future ruined, missed any job opportunity then who would be responsible
 agar yahi sahi paksh he to hamen ek kaam karnaa chahie
 Amending the constitution, asking questions in India should be declared illegal and if not asked, scholarship of ten thousand months should be awarded
 chup rahane kii kuch to keemat mili
 We have come to this level
 poochne par sampadak kii naukari chali jaati he, poochne par professor ko raat das baje hataa diya jaataa he
 Teachers of Delhi University are also on strike from 19 to 23 March
 19 march ko north campus ke arts faikalti main jamaa hue or vahaan se march kiya, dharna diya
 The point is that the government has formulated a policy that colleges will raise thirty percent of their own funds
 sarkaar ne HEFA naam kii nai sanstha banaai he jiskaa puraa naam he hair ajukeshan funding agency
 The college or university will now have to borrow from it
 dilli vishvavidhyalay hi nahin, iaiti ne bhi kaha he ki agar sarkaar paise kii jagah lone degi to iskaa asar chaatro par padegaa
 The fees will be expensive
 maheshwar peri ne bataaya ki iske kaaran aaj im ke do saal kii fees 15 lakh tak pahunch gai he, jabaki kuch saal pehle maatr do lakh thi
 Would you like to let your children's education fees become expensive to such an extent
 agar santhaan sarkaar se hi lone lekar sarkaar ko chukaate rahenge to chaatro ke project par karch nahin kar paaenge
 The Delhi University Teachers Association is also expressing reservations about this hefa
 unka kahana he ki ucch shiksha mahangi ho jaaegi
 Earlier universities, iits or iims used to send proposals to the government and the government used to send money that there should be no shortage of writing
 ab unhen lone lenaa pad rahaa he
 If education will be expensive, then the children of ordinary Indians will be able to study by paying a fee of 15 lakhs or two lakhs
 isi ko lekar virodh pradarshan ho rahaa he
 The issue of pension is also very serious
 bahut se shikshakon ko pension nahin mila he
 While much time has passed since he retired
 nai pension niti kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 There is another issue of opposition to Duta
 yah thodaa jatil he magar bhav yah he ki iske zarie dalit or adivasee chaatro ko aane kaa rasta sankara kiya ja rahaa he
 The teachers say that the reservation policy is being changed
 iske liye roster ko badla ja rahaa he
 They say that this will make it even more difficult for Dalit and tribal students to reach the position of lecturer and professor
 vishvavidhyalay ke kaaryakari parishad ke sadsy rajesh jha kaa kahana he ki arakshit varg main 25 pratishat siten kam ho jaaengi
 With this, people who have been teaching on Adahak for years will also lose their chances of getting a job
 aap jaanate hai ki diu main kai hazaar asthaayee shikshak padhaa rahe hai
 Ideally, all of them should be permanent, but less has to be done to find a way out of it
 kya aisa he, aisa nahin he to isi kaa jawaab de dijie ki jab diu main shikshakon ke pad khaali hai to baaki shaharon ke college main aapke bacchon ko padhaa koun rahaa he, teacher yaa diwaar, yaa noujvaan hording par netaa ji kaa slogan hi pard rahe hai
 Slogan does not have heaven
 simpal sawaal he, pad khaali hai, class main bachche hai to shikshak permanent kyon nahin hai
 There is no answer to this question, then only such statements come that the time has come for martyrdom for the temple
 agar collejon par 30 fisadi fund jutaney kaa dabaav daalaa jayega to fees kaaphi badhane ja rahi he
 It is claimed in the newspapers that tax collection has increased due to GST
 sarkaar kii kamai bad gai he phir us kamai ko padhai likhaai par kyon nahin karch kiya ja rahaa he
 Then why is the budget being reduced
 kya daawa sahi nahin he
 Do not see these teachers in the left right slot
 inke jo sawaal hai uskaa asar aap par zyaada padegaa
 It is a matter of left right and right ones are also crying
 jinhone naare lagaae, mukhute pahane unamem se bhi bahuton kaa permanent nahin ho rahaa he
 Now they cannot say, but send messages in the inbox to take up our issue, do you know how to get a job
 aashay yah he ki saadhaaran parivaar ke bacchon ke barbaad hone kaa intazaam puraa ho chukaa he
 Honest daroga, tehsildar, belladar, engineer, school teacher, bank clerk, people earning 20-30 thousand will not be able to give good and cheap education to their children
 bihar ke kai vishvavidhyalayon main bie kaa seshan do se teen saal let chal rahaa he
 If you want to see your children ruined, then get them enrolled in Bihar's BN Mandal University, Magadh University, BR Ambedkar Bihar University, Jayaprakash Narayan University
 vahaan teen saal kaa bie paanch se saat saal main karaae jane kaa formula patent hua he
 The young man will not come out of college, otherwise he will not go out unemployed
 bihar ke naujavaanon ne ise sweekaar bhi kar liya he
 Name a college in Bihar, UP, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand which is running properly, where there are qualified and all teachers
 kaayade se bees college kaa naam poochna chahie tha magar ek kaa naam nahin bataa paaenge ye
 Therefore, if your children are ruined, then send them for the martyrdom of the temple, the MP is waiting for them
 pradhanmantri kaa patna uniwarsity main diya bayaan mujhe yaad he
 Last year, when Patna University turned 100, he said that 10,000 crore would be given in five years to bring ten private and ten government universities to the top 100 universities in the world
 2016-17 ke bajet main is idia kaa aagaman hua tha
 No money was shown for it in that budget
 2017-18 ke bajet ke expendichar pej par iske liye 50 karod kaa zikr mila
 50 crores came from giving and 10,000 crores was talking about giving
 2018-19 ke bajet main vishwa stareey santhaan banane ke saamne 250 karod likhaa he
 In his earlier budget, you heard that he has written only 50 crores
 do saal main koi 300 karod kaa zikr bajet main miltaa he
 While there has been talk that 10,000 crores will be given in five years
 yah sab tabhi pataa chalegaa jab aap akhbaar padhane or tivi dekhne kaa tarika badalenge
 The needs have increased but the budget is becoming less
 kuch pratishat badhaakar bataaya jaataa he ki badha he magar vaastavik rup se bahut kami aa rahi he
 You can say that when you want to study science and history from whatsapp University and news channels then why spend money on college
 vaise jab duuta ke shikshak pradarshan kar rahe the tab dilli vishvavidhyalay ke mukt shiksha vidhyalay ke chaatr bhi putala lekar foonkane aa gaye the
 They demand that they have not yet reached the course material
 skool of open larning main bhi paanch lakh chaatr hai
 These students have got second and third year study material after November, while the session starts from July itself
 may main inaki pariksha honi he
 Without reading a book, how are you going to give this exam, then you are blowing the effigy
 hindi ke naam par na jane kitne mantri channelon par aakar bavaal kar den magar in chaatro kaa kahana he ki hindi madhyam ke chaatro ko bhi kuch vishay kii adhyayan saamagree angrezi main di ja rahi he
 Teachers who are not getting study material are not even teaching that subject
 or study material main likhaa gaya he ki aap jaanch len ki di gai saamagree aapke silebus main he yaa nahin
 This is the condition of Delhi University, so what will happen in the towns and state capitals
 aakhir ham bardaasht kaise kar rahe hai ki bied kii padhai kaa satr ek saal or do saal deree se kaise chal saktaa he
 Dr
 of Agra bhim raav ambedkar vishvavidhyalay ke ek chaatr kaa patr aayaa he

 The Vice Chancellor and Controller of Examinations have also been mailed but no results were found

 Sir, please speak once on the prime time show of jobs
 shaayad vishvividlayay ke kulapati or pariksha niyantrak ko kuch samaj aa sake
 If they have a leather chair in their room and a white towel on it, then they will never understand what is the pain of playing with the lives of thousands of students
 agar in chaatro main se ek kaa bhi bhavishya barbaad hua, naukari ke avasar se koi chook gaya to koun zimmedaar hoga
 Teachers of Delhi University are also on strike from 19 to 23 March
 19 march ko north campus ke arts faikalti main jamaa hue or vahaan se march kiya, dharna diya
 The point is that the government has formulated a policy that colleges will raise thirty percent of their own funds

 The issue of pension is also very serious
 bahut se shikshakon ko pension nahin mila he
 While much time has passed since he retired
 nai pension niti kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 There is another issue of opposition to Duta
 yah thodaa jatil he magar bhav yah he ki iske zarie dalit or adivasee chaatro ko aane kaa rasta sankara kiya ja rahaa he
 The teachers say that the reservation policy is being changed
 iske liye roster ko badla ja rahaa he
 They say that this will make it even more difficult for Dalit and tribal students to reach the position of lecturer and professor

 aap jaanate hai ki diu main kai hazaar asthaayee shikshak padhaa rahe hai
 Ideally, all of them should be permanent, but less has to be done to find a way out of it

 Slogan does not have heaven
 simpal sawaal he, pad khaali hai, class main bachche hai to shikshak permanent kyon nahin hai
 There is no answer to this question, then only such statements come that the time has come for martyrdom for the temple
 agar collejon par 30 fisadi fund jutaney kaa dabaav daalaa jayega to fees kaaphi badhane ja rahi he
 It is claimed in the newspapers that tax collection has increased due to GST

 Then why is the budget being reduced
 kya daawa sahi nahin he

 You know that there are several thousand temporary teachers teaching in DU
 kaayade se in sabhi ko permanent kar dena chahie magar kam ko karnaa pade iskaa rasta nikaala ja rahaa he
 Is it not so, then do not answer this, when teachers are vacant in DU, then who is teaching your children in college of other cities, teacher or wall, or reading the leader's slogan on youth hoarding
 Have been
 slogan main swarg nahin hota he
 Simple question, the positions are vacant, there are children in the class, so why are the teachers not permanent? is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin he tabhi is tarah ke bayaan aate hai ki mandir ke liye shahadat dene kaa time aa gaya he
 If the colleges are forced to raise 30 per cent of the funds, then the fees are going to increase significantly
 akhabaaron main daawa kiya jaataa rahata he ki jiesti ke kaaran tex collection bad gaya he
 The government's earnings have increased, then why is that income not being spent on writing? phir bajet kyon kam ho rahaa he
 Is the claim not correct? aap in shikshakon ko left rhite ke khaanche main mat dekhie
 Their questions will affect you more
 rahi baat left rhite kii to rhite vaale bhi ro rahe hai

 isliye agar aapke bachche barbaad ho chuke hai to unhen mandir kii shahadat ke liye bhej dijie, saansad ji unka intazaar kar rahe hai
 i remember the statement made by the Prime Minister at Patna University
 pichley saal patna uniwarsity ke 100 saal hone par unhone kaha tha ki das privet or das sarkari uniwarsity ko duniya kii chotii kii 100 uniwarsity main pahunchane ke liye paanch saal main 10,000 karod die jaaenge
 The idea was introduced in the 2016-17 budget
 us bajet main iske liye koi paisa nahin dikhaa
 50 crore was mentioned on the 2017-18 budget expenditure page
 dekar aae the 50 karod or dene kii baat kar rahe the 10,000 karod
 In the budget of 2018-19, 250 crore has been written in front of creating a world class institution
 uske pehle ke bajet main aapane suna ki maatr 50 karod likhaa he
 In two years, the reference of 300 million rupees is found in the budget
 jabaki baat hui he ki paanch saal main 10,000 karod die jaaenge
 This will be known only when you change the way you read newspapers and watch TV
 zaruuratein bad gayi hai magar bajet kam hota ja rahaa he
 It is said that by increasing some percentage, it has increased but in reality there is a lot of decrease
 aap kah sakate hai ki jab whatsap uniwarsity or news channelon se hi vigyaan or itihaas padhanaa he to phir college par paise karch kyon kiye jaaen
 By the way, while the teachers of DUTA were demonstrating, the students of the Open School of Education of Delhi University also came to blow the effigy
 inaki maang he ki abhi tak inke paas course material nahin pahunchaa he
 The School of Open Learning also has five lakh students
 in chaatro ko november ke baad duusare or tisare varsh kaa study material mila he jabaki satr to july se hi shuru ho jaataa he
 They are to be tested in May
 bina kitaab padhe ye pariksha kaise denge to putala phoonk rahe hai
 Not knowing in the name of Hindi, how many ministers come and go on the channels, but these students say that students of Hindi medium are also being given study material in English
 jiskaa study material nahin mil rahaa he us vishay ko shikshak bhi nahin padhaa rahe hai
 And it has been written in the study material that you check whether the given material is in your syllabus or not
 ye dilli vishvavidhyalay kaa haal he, to kasbon or rajyon kii rajdhaniyon main kya haal hoga
 After all, how are we tolerating how the b
ed
 education session can be delayed by one year and two years
 agra ke dow
 a letter from a student of Bhim Rao Ambedkar University has arrived
 aap bhi pard len
 
 
 The comments raveesh sar, ham log upi ke dow
 Bhim Rao Ambedkar Vishwavidyalaya is a student of SED 2015-17 b
ed year course in Agra, although we should have got the exam and result by june-july 2017 but due to the negligence of the university, we will be in second year or final year examination
 It was concluded in the last week of December 2017
 isaki prayogtmak pariksha farvari 2018 main hui lekin abhi tak parinaam nahin aayaa he
 There is a vacancy of LT grade in UP Public Service Commission, in which we also have to join but due to lack of results, the future of thousands of students is in balance
 vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati or pariksha niyantrak ko bhi mail kiya gaya he lekin koi parinaam nahin niklaa he
 The result of second university students of b
ed session 2015-17 has come only in July or August 2017
 sar aap naukari ke prime time sho par ek baar bol dijie
 Perhaps the chancellor of the University and the Controller of Examinations can understand something
 agar inke kamare main ledar kii kursi he or us par safed tauliya he to inhen kabhi samaj nahin aayega ki hazaron chaatro kii zindagi se khilne kaa dard kya hota he
 If one of these students also had a future ruined, missed any job opportunity then who would be responsible
 akhabaaron main daawa kiya jaataa rahata he ki jiesti ke kaaran tex collection bad gaya he
 The government's earnings have increased, then why is that income not being spent on writing? phir bajet kyon kam ho rahaa he
