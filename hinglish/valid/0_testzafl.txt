 Dayaram was the last important Vaishnava poet of medieval Gujarati devotional poetry
 ve garabi sahitya rachane ke liye prasiddh hai
 He was a confirmed poet
 unke avsaan ke saath madhyakaal or krishna-bhakthi-kavy donon kaa paryavsaan ho gaya
 The symbols of this epochal change - some are targeted only in Dayaram's poetry
 bhakthi kaa vah teevr bhavaveg evam anany samarpanamayi nishtha jo narsi or mira ke kavy main paryaapt maatra main uplabdh hoti he unki rachanaaon main us rup main praapt nahin hoti
 In its place human love and luxury are included, although the external form remains of the traditional gopi-krishna pastimes
 isi sankramanakalin sthiti ko lakshith karte hue gujarat ke prasiddh itihaaskaar-sahityakar kanhaiyalaal maniklal munshi ne apana abhimath vyakt kiya ki dayaramnu bhaktakaviyon maa sthaan na thi, pranayna amar kaviyoma che
 Despite being exaggerated, this statement clearly points towards the internal reality of Dayaram's poetry
 dayaram kaa janm narmadattavarti saathodara ke chandod naamak gram main prabhuram nagar ke ghar hua tha
 Being an orphan in childhood, his early life was spent in chaos
 pehle ve keshavanand sanyasi ke shishy hue, phir ichhaaraam bhatta ke, jo pushtimargeey vaishnav the

 "anubhavmanjari" naamak apni rachana main dayaram ne swayan ko nandadaas kaa avatar mana he
 There was a considerable amount of rapture in him like the friendly lover Nandadas, no doubt, because he too did not consider his temporal love for Baalvidhava Ratanbai as an antithesis to spiritual worship and even got the support of his guru

 Acharya Bhamah has presented the first formulated feature of the epic in Sanskrit poetry and Dandi, Rudrat and Vishwanath in the later Acharyas have extended the feature of this epic form in its own way
 acharya vishwanath kaa lakshan nirupan is parampara main antim hone ke kaaran sabhi purvavarti maton ke sarasankalan ke rup main uplabdh he
 In the epic, India has been called the country of India or Bharat and the inhabitants of India have been called the children of Bharati or Bharata
 acharya vishwanath ke anusaar mahakavy ke lakshan is prakaar hai : The above representation of Acharya Vishwanath instead of presenting a scientific and systematic definition of the nature of the epic, presents an orderly description of its major and secondary features
 iske aadhaar par sanskrit kavyashastra main uplabdh mahakavy ke lakshanon kaa saar is prakaar kiya ja saktaa he : Storyline - The plot of the epic must be historical or historical
 vistaar - kathanak kaa kalver jivan ke vividh roopon evam varnanon se samrudh hona chahie
 These descriptions should be related to the natural, social and political fields in such a way that through them a complete picture of human life can be present with its full splendor, picture and detail
 isiilie uskaa aayam vistrut hona chahie
 Configuration - The composition of the plot should be accompanied by the rules of theatrical treaties, that is, the development of the epic story should be gradual
 uski aadhikarik katha evam anya prakarnon kaa parsparik sambandh upakaarya-upakaarak-bhav se hona chahie tathaa inamen auchitypurna purvapar anviti rahani chahie
 Nayaka - The hero of the epic should be the deity or the like Kshatriya, whose character is harmonized with the enduring qualities - that is, he should be a Mahasattva, a very serious, apologetic demagogue, a constant, nimble, arrogant and determined
 paatr bhi usee ke anuroop vishisht vyakti, raajputr, muni aadi hone chahie
 Ras - In the epic, the status of one of the rasas of the beautiful, heroic, calm and compassion is in the form of Angi and the part of the other Rasas
 fal - mahakavy sadvruth hota he - arthath uski pravriti shiv evam satya kii ore hoti he or uskaa uddeshy hota he chatuvarg kii prapti
 Style - In the context of style, Sanskrit masters have often mentioned very gross stereotypes
 udaahranarth ek hi chand main sarg rachana tathaa sargant main chhandaparivartan, ashtaadhik sargon main vibhaajan, namakaran kaa aadhaar aadi
 But in the light of the other characteristics of the epic, it is clear that the style of the epic should be Nanavarnan pardon, extension, ornamented with audible circles, aspiration
 acharya bhamah ne is bhashaa ko salankar, agraamy shabdon se yukt arthath shisht nagar bhashaa kaha he
 The characteristics of the epic, which were described by the Indian Acharyas, are also mentioned by the Acharyas of the West, similar to the characteristics of the word
 arestu ne traasadee se mahakavy kii tulana karte hue kaha he ki "geet evam drishyvighan ke atirikt donon ke ang bhi samaan hi hai
 "that is, there are four basic elements of the epic - narrative, character, ideology and phraseology
 kathavstu ke sambandh main unka mat he ki In relation to the characters of the epic, Aristotle simply stated that "there is a similarity between the epic and the tragedy, that even in that the characters of the higher order have a copycat
 " traasadee ke paatro se samanta ke aadhaar par yah nishkarsh nikaalnaa kathin nahin ki mahakavy ke paatr bhi praaia: traasadee ke samaan - bhadra, vaibhavshaalee, kuleen or yashasvi hone chahie
 According to Rudrat, the epic also describes Pratinayak and his clan
 arestu ke anusaar mahakavy kaa prabhaav or prayojan bhi traasadee ke samaan hona chahie, arthath manovegon kaa virechan, uskaa prayojan or tajjanya man:shanti uskaa prabhaav hona chahie
 This effect can be moral or emotional or both
 arestu ke shabdon main mahakavy kii style kaa bhi "purna utkarsh yah he ki vah prasann ho kintu kshudra na ho
 "that is, dignity and prasadguna are the core elements of the epic style and dignity is the basis of exceptionalism
 unke matanusaar mahakavy kii bhashastyli traasadee kii karunamdhur alankrita style se bhinn, lokatikrant prayogon se kalatmak, udaatt evam garimavarisht honi chahie
 For the creation of the epic, he emphasizes the use of the same stanza - veer stanza - from the beginning to the end, because its form is more grand and dignified than other circles in which obsolete and figurative words are easily ingrained
 parvarti vidwaanon ne bhi mahakavy ke vibhinn tatwon ke sandarbh main unheen visheshtaon kaa punrakhyaan kiya he jinka ullekh acharya arestu kar chuke the
 The basis of Veerakavya has been accepted by all as a legend of ethnic pride
 jon herington virakavy ke liye aitihaasik aadharbhumi kii aavashyaktaa par bal dete hai or spencer virakavy ke liye vaibhav or garima ko aadharbhoot tatv maanate hai
 The French poet critics Palette, Vocale and Ronsar, etc
 have also urged the creation of an atmosphere that is free and lavish from petty events, making the epic content most dignified, grand and sublime
 bhartiya or paashchaatya aalochakon ke uparyukt nirupan kii tulana karne par spasht ho jaataa he ki donon main hi mahakavy ke vibhinn tatwon ke sandarbh main ek hi gun par baar-baar shabdabhed se bal diya gaya he or vah he - bhavyata evam garima, jo audaatya ke ang hai
 In fact, the epic is not inspired by the consciousness of the individual, but by the consciousness of the entire era and nation
 isi kaaran uske mul tatv deshkal saapeksh na hokar saarvbhaum hote hai -- jinke abhaav main kisi bhi desh athwa yug kii koi rachana mahakavy nahin ban sakati or jinke sadbhaav main, paramparaagat shastreey lakshanon kii baadha hone par bhi, kisi kriti ko mahakavy ke gaurav se vanchit karnaa sambhav nahin hota
 These core elements are - is prakaar audaatya athwa mahattatv hi mahakavy kaa praan he
 The evolution and development of Sanskrit epic is described as- mahakavy ke vikaas kaa itihaas ham do roopon main karte hai
 Stylistic development rupagat vikaas ke antargat sabase pehle vaidic kaal aata he jinamein aakhyaan, devstuti, bhavapradhanta ityadi aate hai
 Under the Veeramhakaavya comes the prominence of the elements of Ramayana, Mahabharata and narrative
 loukik mahakavy main kalidas evam parvarti kavyakaron ne bhavapaksh kii apeksha kalapaksh kii udaattata par bal diya he
 The stylistic development of the epic is found in the poetry of Ramayana, Mahabharata, Kalidasa, Ashwaghosh etc
 in the prasadic style
 alankaratmak style, bharavi, magh, sriharsh aadi ke kaavyon main praapt hoti he
 The syllabic style is found in dual poetics
 dwayrthak kavy dhnanjaykrut- dwisandhankavy, kavirajasurikrut-raghavpandavi, raghavchudamanidikshitkrut-raghavayadav- pandavi
 The epics originate from the narratives of the Rigveda from the Suktas - Indra, Varuna, Vishnu and Usha, etc
, to the eulogies and Narasanshi saga
 brahman aadi granthon main in akhyan aadi kaa vistrut rup miltaa he
 This form later turned into an epic
 kronchvadh se duhkhi manwaale mahakavi valmiki ke vaani se niklaa vyaadh-shaap valmikikrut ramayana ke rup main aadi kavy ke gaurav ko praapt kar liya tathaa iske praneta valmiki ko adikavi kaa gaurav praapt hua
 After the Valmikkrit Ramayana and the Ramayana, the Ved Vyas Mahabharata also became the poetic poetry of the later poets
 bhartiya parampara veda ko hi kavy, shaastra aadi kaa utpattisthal maanati rahi he
 The most delightful fantasies of the Vedic Manishi have originated with all the poetic animosities in the usurpers of the Rigveda
 devstuti ke atirikt narashansiyon main bhi kaavyatmak rup jhalkata he
 In praise of the then benevolent kings, the exaggerated commendations are called Narashansi
 aitareibrahman kii saptam panchika main shunagashep aakhyaan evam ashtum panchika main ‘aindamahabhishek’ke anek ansh sundar kavy kii chata bakhirte hai
 In this way, the existence of poetry is visible in the entire Vedic literature, but the complete pattern of the epic style is not visible anywhere
 sanskrit mahakavy dharaa kii mul udgam sthali adikavy ramayana hi he, jisamen mahakavy kii sabhi visheshtaon kaa darshan ho jaataa he
 In the development tradition of the epics of Sanskrit literature, the place of 'munitray' - Panini, Varruchi and Patanjali of Sanskrit grammar is very important
 acharya rudrat dwaara rachit ‘kaavyalankar sutara’ ke tikaakar nemisadhu ne panini dwaara rachit mahakavy ‘jambavatijay’ yaa ‘patalvijay’ kaa ullekh kiya he
 In the great language of Patanjali, poetry full of poetry is available
 in sab pramaanon ke adhar par mahakavy kaa udai isvi purv kii ashtum shatee main hi panini dwaara ho chukaa tha
 In the scriptures, Rajashekhar considered Panini to be the author of both 'grammar' and 'jambavatijay'
 vararuchi ke naam se bhi anek shloke vibhinn subhashit sangrahon main praapt hote hai
 Patanjali mentions an epic made by Varruchi in the Mahabharata- vararuchi-pranit mahakavy kaa naam ‘kanthabharan’ he
 Varruchi did not imitate Panini only by writing 'vartik' and met her with direct poetry
 patanjali ne apane mahabhashya main drushtaant ke rup main bahut se shlokon yaa shlokakhandon ko uddhrut kiya jinke anushilan se sanskrit-kavyadhara kii pracheenta siddh hoti he
 Poetry expects peaceable environment, economic prosperity and social peace due to its beautiful construction and composition, as much as it inspires a talented refugee
 pracheen bharatvarsh ke itihaas main vah yug shakon ke bhayankar akramanon se bhartiya janata, dharm tathaa samskruti ke rakshak maalav samvath ke aitihaasik sansthaapak shakari malvganadhyaksh vikramaditya kaa he
 In this era, Kalidasa, the worshiper of Indian culture, rises in Kavyakasha
 kalidas ko vastutah praudh, parishkrut, pranjal evam manojna kavyastylee kaa pravartak kaha ja saktaa he
 Kalidasji's poetic performance was exemplary for later poets and writers
 sanskrit mahakavy ko teen samoohon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he- Scholars have considered Kalidasa's predecessors Poet Vyas and Valmiki in Rishikoti
 inaki rachanaaon main saralata or swaabhaaviktaa kaa put he
 In Sanskrit literature, the name of Mahakavi 'bharavi' will be particularly notable because in the tradition of Sanskrit epics, the Council of Kalidasa occupies a prominent place, both in terms of time and poetry
 inkaa ek maatra kaaljayi mahakavy ‘kiratarjunium’ he jo apni arthpurna uktiyon ke liye vidwanmandali main lokapriy ho gaya
 Its council is the 'shishupalavadham' of Magha, an important epic of the same level
 sanskrit-mahakavyon kii parampara main kalkram ke anusaar sabase antim or mahatvapurn kavy barahavin shatabdi ke uttarardh main likhaa gaya mahakavi sriharsh kaa ‘naishadhicharitam’ he
 He pursued his epic according to the tradition prevalent in the society then and reached the peak of the development of that style
 sankshep main mahakavy ke vikaas par drushtipaat karne se gyaat hota he ki aarmabhik yug main naiysargikta kaa hi kavy main mulya tha, vahi gun aadar kii drushti se dekha jaataa tha
 Over time, the poets in their poetry looked at the Akshardambara and the Alkaaravniyas and began to consider them to be the life of poetry
 raghuvansh, kumarasambhav, kiratarjunium, shishupalavadh or naishadhacharit ko 'panchamahakavy' kaha jaataa he

 ye drishy junglee raja cobra aam taur par ek halke swabhaav he ki samarthan he, or pareshaan or nirmit kshetron main unke lagaataar ghatana ke baavjood, manushyon se bachane main maahir hai
 Naturalist Michael Wilmer Forbes Tweedie felt that "this notion is based on the general tendency to dramatize all qualities of snakes with little regard for the truth about them
" ek pal ke pratibimb se pataa chalata he ki yah aisa hona chahie, prajatiyon ke liye, yah asaamaanya nahin he main bhi aabaadi vaale kshetron, or jaanboojhkar yaa anjaane main, logon ko king cobra kaaphi aksar muthbhed chahie to saanp vastav main adatan aakraamak the, iske kaatane kaa record lagaataar ho saktaa he;

 Rakshabandhan is a Hindu and Jain festival celebrated annually on the full moon day of the month of Shravan
 shravan main manaaye jane ke kaaran ise shrawani yaa saluno bhi kehete hai
 Rakhi or Rakshasutra has the most importance in Rakshabandhan
 raakhi kachche soot jaise sasti vastu se lekar rangeen kalave, reshmi dhaage, tathaa sone yaa chaandi jaisi manhagi vastu tak kii ho sakati he
 Rakhi is usually tied only by brothers, but respect is also tied by Brahmins, Gurus and younger girls in the family
 kabhi-kabhi saarvajanik rup se kisi netaa yaa pratishthit vyakti ko bhi raakhi baandhi jaati he
 Now the tradition of tying rakhi to trees has also started for conservation of nature
 hindustan main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke purush sadsy paraspar bhaichaare ke liye ek duusare ko bhagava rang kii raakhi bandhate hai
 The Karmakandi Pandit or Acharya chants a sloka in Sanskrit while tying Rakshasutra in all the religious rituals of Hinduism, in which the relation of Rakshabandhan is clearly visible to King Bali
 bhavishyapurana ke anusaar indrani dwaara nirmit rakshasutra ko devguru brihaspati ne indra ke haathon baandhte hue nimnlikhit swastivachan kiya - The Hindi sense of this verse is - "I bind you with the same thread that the great powerful Danavendra king Bali was tied
 he rakshe ! tum adig rahanaa " Retired from bathing in the morning, girls and women decorate a plate of worship
 thali main raakhi ke saath roli yaa haldi, chaaval, deepak, mithai or kuch paise bhi hote hai
 Boys and men get ready and sit in worship or any appropriate place to get the vaccine done
 pehle abhisht devtaa kii puja kii jaati he, iske baad roli yaa haldi se bhai kaa tikaa karke chaaval ko tike par lagaaya jaataa he or sir par chhidaka jaataa he, uski aarti utaari jaati he, dahini kalai par raakhi baandhi jaati he or paison se nyochhavar karke unhen garibon main baant diya jaataa he
 In many provinces of India, there is also the practice of placing Bhojali or Bhujriya over the ear of a brother
 bhai bahan ko uphaar yaa dhan detaa he
 Thus food is served only after completing the Rakshabandhan ritual
 prayek parv kii tarah uphaaron or khaane-pine ke vishesh pakwaanon kaa mahatva rakshabandhan main bhi hota he

 This festival is so widely and deeply ingrained in Indian society that not only its social significance, religion, mythology, history, literature and films are also untouched by it
 nepal ke pahari ilaakon main brahman evam kshetreey samudaay main raksha bandhan guru or bhaaginey ke haath se bandha jaataa he
 But Nepali Indians of Indian origin living in the south border tie rakhi to sister like Indians
 is din bahanen apane bhai ke daayen haath par raakhi baandhakar uske maathe par tilak karti hai or uski deergh aayu kii kaamana karti hai
 In return, the brother promises to protect them

 The siblings feed each other sweets and assure them to live together in happiness and sorrow

 This is the reason that on this occasion, there is a trend to tie up defense not only to sister and brother but also in other relationships
 guru shishy ko rakshasutra bandhta he to shishy guru ko
 In India, in ancient times, when a graduate left the Gurukul after completing his education, he tied the Rakshatutra to get the blessing of the Acharya while the Acharya tied the Rakshatutra to his student with the wish that he had acquired the knowledge He should use it properly in his future life so that he can protect his knowledge as well as the dignity of Acharya
 Have it isi parampara ke anuroop aaj bhi kisi dharmik vidhi vidhaan se purv purohit yajmaan ko rakshasutra bandhta he or yajmaan purohit ko
 In this way, the two bind each other in their bonds to protect each other's honor
 rakshabandhan parv saamaajik or paariwarik ekbaddhata yaa ekasutrata kaa saanskrithik upaay rahaa he
 After marriage, the sister goes to a strange home

 Two families and clans have a mutual sum
 samaaj ke vibhinn virgon ke bich bhi ekasutrata ke rup main is parv kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Thus the link that has been broken can be reawakened

 bhagwaan indra ghabara kar brihaspati ke paas gayi
 Indrani, Indra's wife, was listening to everyone sitting there
 unhone resham kaa dhaagaa mantron kii shakti se pavitra karke apane pati ke haath par band diya
