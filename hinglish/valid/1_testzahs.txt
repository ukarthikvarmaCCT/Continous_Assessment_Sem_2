 Prophet of Islam includes "messengers", a divine revelation through a malak; And the "prophet", the Shari'ah that Muslims believe is one of the six articles of Islamic faith, and is specifically mentioned in the Quran
 islam ke anusaar allaah ne dharti par manushya ke maargdarshan ke liye samay samay par kisi vyakti vishesh ko apana doot banaaya
 These messengers were also from the human race and called people to God, these people are called prophets in Islam
 jin nabiyon ko ishwar ne swayan shaastra yaa dharm pustaken pradaan kin unhen rasul kehete hai
 Muslims believe that the first prophet was also the first human being, Adam, created by Allah
 yahudiyon main 48 nabiyon kaa zikr he
 Many prophets of Christianity are mentioned in the Quran, because Jesus was also one of the prophets
 isai dharm ke kai nabiyon kaa quran main ullekh kiya gaya he lekin thodaa alag roopon main ullekh kiya gaaya he
 For example, the Jewish Elisha is called Elisa, Job is Ayub, Jesus is Jesus, etc
 musa ko diya gaya torah ko tavaraat kaha jaataa he, daaud ko die gaye kirthan zaboor hai
 The Gospel given to Jesus is Gospel
 In Islam, prophets are usually men
 islam main musalamaanon ke liye mohammad adwitiya hai, musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki mohammad "naboovat kii muhar" hai; yah baat quran bataata he
 Muslims who believe that the Quran descended from Allah, which is protected by Allah and free from any kind of corrupt, made such a book on Muhammad
 yah kitaab yom al-qiyama tak mahfuz rahegi musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki mohammad aakhri nabi hai, haalanki mohammad ke baad nabi nahin magar sant honge 
 In the Muslim faith, every prophet of Islam believed the same main Islamic beliefs, unity of God, worship of that god, idolatry and avoidance of sin, and life on the day of resurrection or the day of judgment and after death
 prayek itihaas main islam kaa prachaar karne ke liye aayaa tha or kuch ne antim islamic paigambar or bhagwaan ke doot ke aane ke bare main bataaya tha, jinhen " ahamed " naam diya jayega jise aam taur par mohammad kaha jaataa he
 In Arabic and Hebrew, the word Nabi means "prophet"
 quran main is sangya ke rup 75 guna hote hai
 Five times in the Quran the words "nubuwwah
 shabd rasul or mursal "sandeshvahak" yaa "preshit" ko darshaate hai or 300 se adhik baar hote hai
 a prophetic "message", the word for risala, appears in the Quran in ten instances
 rasul allaah ke siri rup, shilih di-allaah, aksar saint thomas ke apokraphal adhiniyamon main hota he
 The same verb for Sheliḥeh - shalaḥ, occurs in relation to prophets in the Hebrew Bible
 shabd "prophet" or "massenger" puraane niyam or nae niyam main kai baar prakat hote hai
 The following table shows these words in different languages: hebrew bible main, nauvi shabd adhik saamaanya hota he, or hebrew shabd malakh yahudee dharm main angels ko sanderbhit karata he
 According to Judaism, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi were the last prophets, all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year-old Babylonian exile
 unke saath, nevaha kii pramanik avadhi kii mrityu ho gai, or aajkal keval " bath kol " maujuud he 
 In the New Testament, however, the word "messenger" is more frequent, sometimes with the concept of a prophet
 "massenger" yishu ko apane preriton or jon baptist ko sanderbhit kar saktaa he
 But the book of the Old Testament, the Book of Malachi, speaks of a messenger that Christian commentators interpret as a reference to the future prophet John the Baptist
 muslim vishwaas main, har islamic pigambar ne islam kaa prachaar kiya
 Beliefs of charity, prayer, pilgrimage, worship of God and fasting are believed to be taught by every prophet who comes in some time
 quran swayan islam ko " abraham kaa dharm" kahata he or muslim hone ke naate yaqub or israel ke baarah janajatiyon ko sanderbhit karata he
 The Quran speaks of the Islamic Prophet as the greatest human being of all time
 ek pigambar, shabd kii muslim bhaavana main, vah vyakti he jise allaah ne vishesh rup se islam ke vishwaas ko sikhaane ke liye chunaa he
 In the case of Muhammad, at the age of 40 some people were made prophets late
 yahaya jaise anya logon ko naboovat karne ke liye bahut badi umr main bulaayaa gaya tha, jabaki isa ko ek choti umr main nabi banaaya gaya tha
 The Qur'anic verse 4:69 lists the various virtuous groups of human beings, of which prophets are the highest
 aayat 4:69 main he: - Quran, Sura 4, Ayya 69 bible kii kahaniyaan arabi bhashaa main quran main dobaaraa baniin ityadi) nishchit rup se yahudee hebrew bible, unani old tastomant or greek new testament se alag he, jisamen quran hameshaa pradarshit karata he ki buraai or vipattiyon kii shaktiyon par antat vishwaas jeetne ke liye "allaah kaa abhyaas" he
 “we have created evil people with those without faith
 " "nishchit rup se allaah un logon kii raksha karenge jo vishwaas karte hai
 "thus the Islamic Messiah did not die on the cross like Jesus, but betrayed his enemies and ascended to heaven
 pigambar or doot "koi divine gun saajha nahin karte hai", or unke paas bhagwaan dwaara die gaye anusaar "gyaan yaa shakti" nahin he
 Muslims believe that many people are not mentioned in the Quran, in which many prophets were present
 quran swayan kam se kam chaar anya bhavishyadvaktaaon ko sanderbhit karata he lekin unhen naam nahin detaa he
 a minimalist sound hadith states that there have been 124,000 prophets, while another scholarly source states that "their exact number is not known with any degree of certainty
" " Most mainstream Sunni scholars believe that the Prophet was only male
 phir bhi, ebn hazam, kartubi, ebn hajir or al ashaari jaise kuch logon ne sochaa ki chand jo mariyam se baat karte hue swargdooton kaa zikr karte hai, ve apane paigambar hud ke saboot hai
 Furthermore, Ibn Hajir interprets the hadith "many of the men attained perfection, but none of the women attained perfection except the daughter of Miriam, the daughter of Imran and Asia, the wife of Pharaoh
 " unhone kaha ki purnataa pigambar he
 They claim that Mary and Asiya were prophets
 prakat pustaken aise record hai jo musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki maanav jati ke itihaas main vibhinn islamic bhavishyadvaktaaon ke liye bhagwaan dwaara nirdhaarit kiya gaya tha, in sabhi pustakon ne islam ke code or kanoonon ko jari kiya
 Belief in all open books is an article of faith in Islam and Muslims must believe in all texts to be Muslim
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki quran, antim pavitra shaastra, bheja gaya tha kyonki sabhi pichhali pavitra pustaken yaa to dooshit yaa kho gai thim
 Nevertheless, Islam in its previous forms also speaks of respecting all previous texts
 quran vibhinn nabiyon ko die gaye vibhinn divine uphaaron kaa ullekh karata he
 These can be interpreted in books or forms of divine knowledge
 yadhyapi sabhi ambia kaa maananaa he ki muslimon dwaara atyadhik pratibhashali hone ke liye, vishesh gyaan ke liye "gyaan" kaa vishesh ullekh yah mana jaataa he ki kuch gupt gyaan unke saamne prakat hue the
 The Quran mentions that Abraham prayed for knowledge and later received it
 yah bhi ullekh karata he ki jab yusuf or musa donon ne purna yug tak pahunchaa to gyaan praapt kiya; golith ko maarane ke baad daaud ne raja ke saath gyaan praapt kiya; loot par vishvas rakhane kaa matlab yah he ki allaah ne logon ko bheja he apane sahyogi logon ko or jinnaat kii margdarshakta ke liye satya kii taraf bulaane ke liye
 The Quran names 25 prophets, but it also states that Allah has sent many other prophets and prophets to all the different regions on earth

 In Shivpuran, the Chaturthi of Krishna Paksha of Bhadrapada month is said to be the incarnation date of Mangalmurti Ganesha, while by Ganeshpuran it was on Ganeshvatar Bhadrapad Shukla Chaturthi

 In the fourth section of Rudrasamhita under Shivpuran, there is a description that before taking bath, Mata Parvati produced a child from her scum and gave it to her gatekeeper
 shivaji ne jab pravesh karnaa chaha tab balak ne unhen roak diya
 On this Shiva fought fiercely with the child but no one could defeat him in the battle
 antatogatva bhagwaan shankar ne krodhit hokar apane trishul se us balak kaa sar kaat diya
 This enraged Bhagwati Siva and she decided to do the holocaust
 bhaybheet devataaon ne devarshinarad kii salaah par jagadamba kii stuti karke unhen shant kiya
 On the instructions of Shiva, Vishnu brought the head of the first found creature in the north direction
 mrityunjay rudra ne gaj ke us mastak ko balak ke dhad par rakhkar use punerjeevit kar diya
 Mother Parvati took that gajmukhbalak from Harshatirek with her heart and blessed her to be a pioneer among the gods
 brahma, vishnu, mahesh ne us balak ko sarvadhyaksh ghoshit karke agrapujyahone kaa vardaan diya
 Lord Shankar said to the child - Girijanandan! Your name will be paramount in destroying obstacles
 tu sabakaa poojya banakar mere samast ganon kaa adhyaksh ho ja
 Ganeshwar! You have been born on the Chaturthi of Krishna Paksha of Bhadrapada month after the Moon has risen
 is tithi main vrath karne vaale ke sabhi vighnon kaa naash ho jayega or use sab siddhiyaan praapt hongi
 On the night of Krishna Paksha Chaturthi, after worshiping Ganesha during the lunar day, after worshiping you, offer fast food to the Brahmin on the fasting moon
 tadoparaant swayan bhi meetha bhojan kare
 a person who observes the fast of Sri Ganesh Chaturthi in the year is definitely fulfilled
 ek baar mahadevaji parvati sahit narmada ke tat par gaye
 At a beautiful place there, Parvati ji expressed her desire to play Chaupad with Mahadevji
 tab shivaji ne kaha- hamaari haar-jeet kaa sakshi koun hoga? parvati ne tatkaal vahaan kii ghaas ke tinke batorkar ek putala banaaya or usamen praan-pratishtha karke usase kaha- betaa! ham chapad khelnaa chaahate hai, kintu yahan haar-jeet kaa sakshi koi nahin he
 Therefore, at the end of the game, you can witness our defeat and win and tell who among us won, who lost? khel aarambh hua
 Parvati ji won thrice by chance
 jab ant main balak se haar-jeet kaa nirnay karaayaa gaya to usne mahadevaji ko vijayi bataaya
 As a result, Parvati ji got angry and cursed her to go limp from one foot and suffer in the mud there
 balak ne vinamratapurvak kaha- maan! mujhase agyaanavash aisa ho gaya he
 i did not do this due to any malice or malice
 mujhe kshamaa karen tathaa shaap se mukti kaa upaay bataaen
 Then the mother gave pity to him and she said - Here Nag-girls will come to worship Ganesha
 unke upadesh se tum ganesh vrath karke mujhe praapt karoge
 Having said this, she went to Mount Kailash
 ek varsh baad vahaan shravan main naag-kanyaayein ganesh pujan ke liye ain
 Nag-girls fasted Ganesha and also told that child the method of fasting
 tatpashchaat balak ne 12 din tak shriganeshji kaa vrath kiya
 Then Ganeshji appeared to him and said - i am happy with your fast
 manovanchit var maango
 The boy said - God! Give me so much power in my feet that i can reach my parents on Mount Kailash and they will be happy on me
 ganeshji 'tathastu' kahkar antardhan ho gaye
 The child reached the feet of Lord Shiva
 shivaji ne usase vahaan tak pahunchne ke saadhan ke bare main poocha
 Then the child narrated the whole story to Shiva
 udhar usee din se aprasann hokar parvati shivaji se bhi vimukh ho gai thim
 Thereafter, Lord Shankar also fasted as a child for 21 days, following the effect of which Lord Parvati wished to meet Mahadevji himself
 ve sheeghra hi kailash parvat par aa pahaunchi
 After reaching there, Parvati ji asked Shiva - God! What is the remedy that you have taken as a result of which i have come to you
 shivaji ne 'ganesh vrath' kaa itihaas unase kah diya
 Then Parvati ji worshiped Ganeshji in 21-21 days for 21 days with the desire of meeting his son Kartikeya with Durva, flowers and laddus
 21wein din kartikeya swayan hi parvatiji se aa mili
 He also fasted after hearing the significance of this fast from the mouth of the mother
 kartikeya ne yahi vrath vishwamitraji ko bataaya
 Vishwamitra took a vow and asked Ganesha to be free from birth and ask for the boon of being a 'brahma-sage'
 ganeshji ne unki manokamana purna kii
 Such are Shri Ganeshji, who fulfills everyone's wishes
 ek baar mahadevaji snaan karne ke liye bhogavati gaye
 After her departure, Parvati made an effigy from the scum of her body and named it 'ganesh'
 parvati ne usase kaha- he putr! tum ek mughadal lekar dwaar par baith jaao
 i am taking a bath inside
 jab tak main snaan na kar luun, tab tak tum kisi bhi purush ko bheetar mat aane dena
 When Lord Shiva came after taking bath in Bhogavati, Ganeshji stopped him at the gate
 ise shivaji ne apana apmaan samajha or krodhit hokar unka sir dhad se alag karke bheetar chale gaye
 Parvati, seeing him angry, understood that Mahadevji was angry due to the delay in food
 isliye unhone tatkaal do thaaliyon main bhojan paroskar shivaji ko bulaayaa
 Seeing the second platter, Shiva ji was astonished and asked- For whom is this second platter? Parvati ji spoke for son Ganesh, who is guarding the gate outside
 yah sunakar shivaji or adhik aashcharyachakit hue
 Your son is watching? Yes Nath! Didn't you see it i had seen, but when i stopped myself, i considered him to be a defiant child and cut off his head
 yah sunakar parvati ji bahut duhkhi huin
 She started mourning
 tab parvati ji ko prasann karne ke liye bhagwaan shiv ne ek hathi ke bachche kaa sir katkar balak ke dhad se jod diya
 Parvati ji was thus very happy to find son Ganesh
 unhone pati tathaa putr ko pritipurvak bhojan karakar baad main swayan bhojan kiya
 This incident happened on Bhadrapad Shukla Chaturthi
 isiilie yah tithi punya parv ke rup main manaai jaati he

 The Indian Independence Act 1947 is a legislation passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, according to which Britain-ruled India was divided into two parts
 yah adhinium ko 18 july 1947 ko sweekrut hua or 15 agast 1947 ko bharat bant gaya

 It is a mixture of science, art and philosophy

 The term "ayurveda" is made up of two words - "ayush" and "veda"
 , ahit aayu, sukh aayu, evam dukh aayu - inkaa varnan ho use ayurveda kehete hai
 ) ayurveda bhartiya ayurvigyaan he
 Medical science is the branch of science which is concerned with keeping the human body healthy, freeing or mitigating disease in case of disease and increasing age
 ayurveda vishwa main vidyaman vah sahitya he, jiske adhyayan pashchaat ham apane hi jivan style kaa vishleshan kar sakate he
 Adi Acharya of this scripture is considered as Ashwini Kumar who added the head of a goat to the torso of Daksha Prajapati
 ashvini kumaron se indra ne yah vidya praapt kii
 Indra taught Dhanvantari
 kaashi ke raja divodas dhanvantari ke avatar kahe gaye hai
 Sushruta went to read Ayurveda by visiting her
 atri or bharadwaj bhi is shaastra ke pravartak maane jate hai
 The Acharyas of the Ayur Veda are - Ashvinikumar, Dhanvantari, Divodas, Nakula, Sahadeva, Arki, Chyavan, Janaka, Mercury, Javal, Jajali, Pal, Karath, Agastya, Atri and his six disciples, Sushruta and Charak
 brahma ne ayurveda ko aath bhaagon main baantkar prayek bhaag kaa naam 'tantra' rakhaa 
 These eight parts are the following: is ashtang ayurveda ke antargat dehatatva, sharir vigyaan, shastravidya, bheshaj or dravya gun tatva, chikitsa tatva or dhatri vidya bhi he 
 Apart from this, laws of modern medical systems like analogous medicine, anti-medical and hydro-medicine etc
 are also found in it

 Various scholars consider it to have been composed from 3,000 to 50,000 years before Christ

 Valid texts like Charak, Sushruta, Kashyap etc
 consider Ayurveda as the Upveda of Atharvaveda
 isse ayurveda kii pracheenta siddh hoti he
 Therefore, we can say that the creation of Ayurveda dates back to 3,000 to 50,000 years BC, ie, with or around the origin of creation
 ayurveda ke aitihaasik gyaan ke sandarbh main sarvapratham gyaan kaa ullekh, charak mat ke anusaar mrityulok main ayurveda ke avataran ke saath- agnivesh kaa namollekh he
 First Prajapati from Brahma, Ashwini Kumar from Prajapati, Indra from him and Bhardwaj from Indra studied Ayurveda
 chyavan rishi kaa kaarykaal bhi ashvini kumaron kaa samakaleen mana gaya he
 Rishi Chyavan has a very important contribution in the development of Ayurveda
 phir bharadwaj ne ayurveda ke prabhaav se deergh sukhi or aarogy jivan praapt kar anya rishiyon main uskaa prachaar kiya
 Subsequently Punarvasu Atreya preached Ayurveda to six disciples named Agnivesh, Bhel, Jatu, Parashar, Harit and Ksharpani
 in chah shishyon main sabase adhik budhimaan agnivesh ne sarvapratham ek samhita kaa nirmaan kiya- agnivesh tantra kaa jiskaa pratisanskaar baad main charak ne kiya or uskaa naam charakasamhita padaa, jo ayurveda kaa aadhaar stambh he
 According to Sushruta, Sasruta, along with other Maharishrias, came to Lord Dhanvantari, who appeared in the form of Kashiraj Divodas, and applied to him to study Ayurveda
 us samay bhagwaan dhanvantari ne un logon ko upadesh karte hue kaha ki sarvapratham swayan brahma ne sristi utpaadan purv hi atharvaveda ke upved ayurveda ko ek sahasr adhyay- shat sahasr shlokon main prakashit kiya or punah manushya ko alpamedhaavi samajhakar ise aath angon main vibhakt kar diya
 In this way, Dhanvantari has also considered the publication of Ayurveda as propounded by Brahmadev itself
 punah bhagwaan dhanvantari ne kaha ki brahma se daksh prajapati, unase ashvinikumar dway tathaa unase indra ne ayurveda kaa adhyayan kiya
 The history of Ayurveda is mainly divided into three parts - samhitakaal kaa samay 5veen shatee i
pus
 se 6veen shatee tak mana jaataa he
 This period was the era of the original creations of Ayurveda
 is samay aacharyo ne apni pratibha tathaa anubhav ke bal par bhinn-bhinn angon ke vishay main apane pandityapurna granthon kaa pranayan kiya
 The era of the rise of the Trimuni - Charak, Sushruta and Vagbhata of Ayurveda is also the Samhidakala
 charak samhita granth ke madhyam se kaaychikitsa ke kshetra main adbhut safalataa is kaal kii ek pramukh visheshta he
 Its time has been considered from 7th century to 15th century and this period is known for criticisms and commentators
 is kaal main samhitakaal kii rachanaaon ke upar tikaakaron ne praudh or swasth vyakhyaayen nirupit kin
 The Sushruta Samhita Tika of Acharya Dalhan of this time is considered very important in Ayurveda world
 shodh granth ‘rasratnasamucchy’ bhi isi kaal kii rachana he, jise acharya vagbhat ne charak or sushrut samhita or anek rasshastragyon kii rachana ko aadhaar banaakar likhaa he
 The time of this period is considered from the 14th century to the modern period
 yah kaal vishisht vishyon par granthon kii rachanaaon kaa kaal rahaa he
 The texts like Madhavnidan, Jawardarpan etc
 were also written in this period
 chikitsa ke vibhinn prarupon par bhi is kaal main vishesh dhyaan diya gaya, jo ki vartmaan main bhi praasangik he
 During this period, Ayurveda is being expanded and used on a very large scale
 spasht he ki ayurveda kii pracheenta vedon ke kaal se hi siddh he
 Social medicine is considered a new ideology in modern medicine, but it is not a new ideology but it is just a repetition of it, which has been mentioned in Ayurveda even before 2500 years
 ayurveda kaa uddeshy hi swasth praani ke swasthya kii raksha tathaa rogi kii rog se raksha he
 
 ayurveda ke do uddeshy hai : For this, considering the country, time etc
 suited to your body and nature, regular dieting, gestures, exercise, defecation, bathing, sleeping, awakening, etc
, to follow scriptural routines, nighttime and seasonal habits useful for household life, through hazardous tasks Avoiding, doing every task judiciously, keeping the mind and senses under control, according to the circumstances of the country, time, etc
 Doing some work, not stopping the present velocities of feces, urine etc
, avoiding jealousy, malice, greed, ego etc
, purification of the body from time to time by using vomit, purgation etc
 to remove accumulated defects in the body
 Doing, observing virtue and properly following the teachings of medical practitioners in epidemics arising out of the effects of contaminated air, water, country and time, saving clean and clear water, air, food etc
 Do not do it and motivate others too, these are the means of health protection
 iske liye prayek rog ke These three are called the 'triskandha' of Ayurveda
 iskaa vistrut vivechan ayurveda granthon main kiya gaya he
 Only a brief introduction will be given here
 kintu iske purv aayu ke prayek sanghatak kaa sankshipt parichay aavashyak he, kyonki sanghatakon ke gyaan ke bina unamem honevaale vikaron ko jaananaa sambhav na hoga
 The meaning of Ayurveda is very broad according to the interpretation of the ancient masters and the meanings of these two words 'ayu' and 'veda'
 ayurveda ke aacharyon ne 'sharir, indriya, man tathaa aatma ke sanyog' ko aayu kaha he
 That is, as long as there are many differences of age according to these four assets or misfortune, but in essence it is considered to be of four types: sukhaayu : kisi prakaar ke shiririk yaa maansik vikaas se rahit hote hue, gyaan, vigyaan, bal, paurush, dhanri dhaany, yash, parijan aadi sadhano se samrudh vyakti ko "sukhaayu' kehete hai
 Dukhayu: On the contrary, despite having all the means, a person suffering from physical or mental illness or without being sick, a person without means or health and resources, is called "grief"
 hitayu : swasthya or sadhano se sampann hote hue yaa unamem kuch kami hone par bhi jo vyakti vivek, sadachaar, sushiltaa, udaartaa, satya, ahimsa, shanti, paroapkaar aadi aadi gunon se yukt hote hai or samaaj tathaa lok ke kalyaan main nirat rahete hai unhen hitayu kehete hai
 Ahitayu: On the contrary, those who are imprudent, misdemeanor, cruelty, selfishness, arrogance, atrocities, etc
, have bad qualities and are a curse for society and the people
 is prakaar hit, ahit, sukh or du:kha, aayu ke ye chaar bhed hai
 Similarly, according to Kaalpramana, longevity, middle age and short age, in essence these are three distinctions
 vaise in teenon main bhi anek bhedon kii kalpana kii ja sakati he
 The word 'veda' also has the meaning of power, profit, speed, thought, attainment and knowledge, and the age Veda is called Ayurveda
 arthath jis shaastra main aayu ke swaroop, aayu ke vividh bhed, aayu ke liye hitkaarak or apramaan tathaa unke gyaan ke sadhano kaa evam aayu ke upadanbhoot sharir, indriya, man or aatma, inamen sabhi yaa kisi ek ke vikaas ke saath hit, sukh or deergh aayu kii prapti ke sadhano kaa tathaa inke baadhak vishyon ke niraakaran ke upayon kaa vivchen ho use ayurveda kehete hai
 But nowadays Ayurveda "ancient Indian medical system" is used in this narrow sense
 samast cheshtaaon, indriyon, man ore aatma ke aadharbhoot paanchabhautik pind ko 'sharir' kehete hai
 The human body has six organs in its gross form; Two arms, two legs, head and cervix, and one interstitial
 in angon ke avyavon ko pratyang kehete hai- According to Ayurveda, there are 300 bones in the whole body, which nowadays are considered to be two hundred and six only due to the number of spheres and there are 200 joints, muscles 900, veins 700, arteries 24 and their branches 200, muscles 500 and subtle sources 30,956
 ayurveda ke anusaar sharir main ras, rakt, maance, med, asthi, majja or shukr, ye saat dhaatuen hai
 As a result, they are also decayed due to their use in various functions, but the various substances we take as food and drink not only compensate for this damage, but also confirm the metals
 aaharroop main liya hua padaarth pachakagni, bhutagni or vibhinn dhatvanignyon dwaara paripakv hokar anek parivartanon ke baad purvokt dhaatuon ke rup main parinat hokar in dhaatuon kaa poshan karata he
 In this digestion, the essence part of the diet is nourished by the juices and from the remaining part of the kitta, feces and urine are formed
 yah ras hriday se hota hua shiraaon dwaara saare sharir main pahunchakar prayek dhaatu or ang ko poshan pradaan karata he
 Blood is also nourished by the essence of the metal, juice etc
 on digestion from the metals, and the nourishment of the body is produced from the kitta part, like phlegm from the juice; Blood bile; Stool coming out of the nose through the flesh, ears and eyes; Fattening from sweat; Mud from the bone to the hair and follicle and from the marrow are formed in the form of mud
 shukr main koi mel nahin hota, uske saare bhaag se oj kii utpatti hoti he
 Many micronutrients are also produced from these metallic metals, such as milk from juice, tendons and veins from blood, fat from flesh, skin and its six or seven levels, fattening from muscles, teeth from bone, hair from marrow and oozes from Venus
 Namely substrates are produced
 ye dhaatuen or upadhaatuen vibhinn avyavon main vibhinn roopon main sthit hokar sharir kii vibhinn kriyaaon main upyogi hoti hai
 As long as they remain in the proper quantity and form and their action remains natural, the body remains healthy and when they are in low or high and distorted form, disease is produced in the body
 pracheen darshanik sinddhant ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi sthool padaarth prithvi, jal, tej, vaayu or akaash in paanch mahabhuton ke sanyukt hone se banate hai
 They have different forms due to the difference in their proportions
 isi prakaar sharir ke samast dhaatu, upadhatu or mel paanchabhautik hai
 As a result, all the components of the body and hence the whole body are five physical
 ye sabhi achetan hai
 When there is a coincidence of the soul in them, then there is also consciousness in their consciousness
 uchit paristhiti main shuddh raj or shuddh veery kaa sanyog hone or usamen aatma kaa sanchaar hone se mata ke garbhashay main sharir kaa aarambh hota he
 This is called womb
 mata ke aaharajanit rakt se aparaa or garbhanaadi ke dwaara, jo naabhi se lagi rahati he, garbh poshan praapt karata he
 It gets nourishment by being immersed in the contraceptive and also gets nourishment in the first month and cubes in the second month? In the third month, the development of the organ afferent begins
 chauthe maas main usamen adhik sthirataa aa jaati he tathaa garbh ke lakshan mata main spasht rup se dikhaai padane lagate hai
 In this way, it develops progressively in the mother's body, when the whole organ, consisting of elements and components, often comes out of the Kukshi in the ninth month and takes birth as a new creature
 sharir main prayek ang yaa kisi bhi avyav kaa nirmaan uddeshivishesh se hi hota he, arthath prayek avyav ke dwaara vishisht kaaryon kii siddhi hoti he, jaise haath se pakadana, pair se chalanaa, mukh se khaanaa, daant se chabana aadi
 There are also some components that perform many functions and there are some that carry out a specific function
 jinase kaarivishesh hi hota he unamem us kaary ke liye shaktisampann ek vishisht sookshm rachana hoti he
 This is called sense
 shabd, sparsh, rup, ras or gandh in bahya vishyon kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye krmanusaar kaan, twachaa, netra, jihva or nasika ye avyav indriashray avyav kehalaate hai or inamen sthit vishisht shaktisampann sookshm vastu ko indriya kehete hai
 These are five respectively in sookshm avyavon main panchmahabhuton main se us mahabhoot kii visheshta rahati he jiske shabd aadi vishisht gun hai; jaise shabd ke liye shroatra indriya main akaash, sparsh ke liye tvak indriya main vaayu, rup ke liye chakshu indriya main tej, ras ke liye rasanendriya main jal or gandh ke liye ghranendriya main prithvi tatv
 These five senses are called Gyanendriyas
 inke atirikt vishisht kaarysampadan ke liye paanch camendriyaan bhi hoti hai, jaise gaman ke liye pair, grahan ke liye haath, bolne ke liye jihva, malatyag ke liye guda or mutratyag tathaa santanotpaadan ke liye shishn 
 Like philosophers, Ayurveda considers the senses not egoistic, but physical
 in indriyon kii apane kaaryon man kii prerana se hi pravriti hoti he
 It remains inactive when there is no contact with the mind
 prayek praani ke sharir main atyant sookshm or keval ek man hota he
 It is extremely quick and is the controller of every sense
 kintu yah swayan bhi aatma ke sampark ke bina achetan hone se niskriy rahata he
 In spite of all these three natural qualities, Sattva, Raja and Tama in the mind of each person, one of them usually prevails and accordingly the person is Satvik, Rajas or Tamas, but from time to time, diet, ethics and Due to the influence of circumstances, other qualities also become dominant
 iskaa gyaan pravritiyon ke lakshanon dwaara hota he, yatha raag-dwesh-shunya yatharthadrashtaa man satvik, ragayukt, sachesht or chanchal man rajas or aalasy, dirghsutrata evam niskriyata aadi yukt man taamas hota he
 That is why Satvik mind is considered pure, sattva or natural and Raja and Tama are called its defects
 aatma se chetanta praapt kar prakritik yaa sadosh man apane gunon ke anusaar indriyon ko apane-apane vishyon main pravrutt karata he or usee ke anuroop shaareerik kaary hote hai
 The soul moves the senses and the senses through the mind, because the mind is its cause
 isiilie man kaa sampark jis indriya ke saath hota he usee ke dwaara gyaan hota he, duusare ke dwaara nahin
 Because the mind is subtle on one side, it is not possible to have contact with multiple senses simultaneously
 phir bhi uski gati itani teevr he ki vah ek ke baad duusari indriya ke sampark main shighrata se parivartit hota he, jisase hamen yahi gyaat hota he ki sabhi ke saath uskaa sampark he or sab kaary ek saath ho rahe hai, kintu vastav main aisa nahin hota
 The soul is panchabhumta and different from the mind, is conscious, formless and continual and is a witness form, because itself is devoid and passive
 iske sampark se sakriy kintu achetan man, indriyon or sharir main chetana kaa sanchaar hota he or ve sachesht hote hai
 There is no sign, form, color, shape etc
 in the soul, but without it the body remains inactive due to being unconscious and is called dead and its contact brings consciousness to it, then it is called alive and has many natural actions
 Looks like; Such as shortness of breath, enlarging from small and severed wounds etc
, opening and closing of eyelids, signs of life, movement of mind, knowledge from one sense to another effect, different senses and elements tend to different functions
 To take and hold subjects, to reach from one place to another in the dream, to experience the object seen with one eye with the other eye
 ichha, dwesh, sukh, du:kha, praytn, dhairya, buddhi, samaran shakti, ahankaar aadi sharir main aatma ke hone par hi hote hai; atmarahit mrit sharir main nahin hote
 Therefore, these are called the symptoms of the soul, that is, the soul can be estimated only from the aforesaid symptoms
 maansik kalpana ke atirikt kisi duusari indriya se uskaa pratyaksh karnaa sambhav nahin he
 This soul, despite being perpetual, formless and comprehensive, acts as a result of the predetermined auspicious or inauspicious deeds in the vagina or in the body, the way the mind and senses and subjects come into contact
 uttarottar ashubh kaaryon ke karne se uttarottar adhogati hoti he tathaa shubh karmon ke dwaara uttarottar unnati hone se, man ke raag-dwesh-hin hone par, moksh kii prapti hoti he
 It is clear from this description that the soul is immaterial, but there can be distortions in the mind, senses and body, and because of these three being mutual, the disorder of one can affect the other
 at: inhen prakrutistha rakhana yaa vikrut hone par prakruti main laana yaa swasth karnaa paramaavashyak he
 This leads to long happiness and Hitayu, which respectively helps the soul to get rid of its sole, but also severe, birth death and diseases like bhavabandhan, which is said to be a natural medicine in Ayurveda
 charak ne sankshep main rog or aarogy kaa lakshan yah likhaa he- Sushruta has given the detail of a healthy person in detail- iske vipareet lakshan hon to aswasth samajhnaa chahie
 The disease is also called pathology or disorder
 at: sharir, indriya or man ke prakritik rup yaa kriya main vikruti hona rog he
 The synonym for the cause of the disease is 'diagnosis'
 jab kisi aahaar yaa vihaar se sharir par rog pradurbhaav dikhalaae tab use nidaan kehete hai
 All the things in the world have some kind of definite effect on the body, senses and mind from the person or tradition and due to improper or adverse effects, they cause disorder and cause diseases
 in sabakaa vistrut vivechan kathin he, at: sankshep main inhen teen virgon main baant diya gaya he : Prajnapraadh: Consuming a subject without knowing or knowing an inappropriate item without considering loss of profit due to indiscretion, impatience and prior experience and neglect of reality
 isi ko duusare or spasht shabdon main karm kaa hin, mithyaa or ati yoga bhi kehete hai
 Asmatyendriyarthsayog: Incidental coincidence of the senses with their own forms, etc
, causes the disorder of the senses, body and mind; As if not to look with eyes, to see very bright objects and to see too much and to see very subtle, narrow, very distant and terrible, ungodly, and disordered things
 ye chakshurindriya or uske aashray netron ke saath man or sharir main bhi vikaar utpann karte hai
 This is also called misuse of meaning in other words
 greeshm, varsha, sheet aadi rituon tathaa balya, yuva or vriddhavasthaon kaa bhi sharir aadi par prabhaav padataa hi he, kintu inke hin, mithyaa or atiyog kaa prabhaav vishesh rup se hanikar hota he
 Variations of the aforesaid causes also lead to other distinctions; As prakarantar se inke anya do bhed hote hai- All these reasons have three types of effects on the body: doshapracope- anek kaarnon se sharir ke upadanbhoot akaash aadi paanch tatwon main se kisi ek yaa anek main parivartan hokar unke swaabhaavik anupaat main antar aa janaa anivaary he
 Keeping this in mind, Ayurveda has divided these disorders into vata, pitta and phlegm
 panchmahabhoot evam tridosh kaa alag se vivechan hi uchit he, kintu sankshep main yah samajhnaa chahie ki sansar ke jitne bhi moort padaarth hai ve sab akaash, vaayu, tej, jal or prithvi in paanch tatwon se bane hai
 These earth etc
 are not the ones that we get to see in the gross world every day
 ye pichley sab to purvokt paanchon tatwon ke sanyog se utpann paanchabhautik hai
 Elements that have a plurality in objects are described by the same names
 usee prakaar hamaare sharir kii dhaatuon main yaa unke sanghatakon main jis tatv kii bahulata rahati he ve usee shrenee ke gine jate hai
 Of these five, the sky is formless and the earth is the most gross and the shelter of all
 jo kuch bhi vikaas yaa parivartan hote hai unka prabhaav isi par spasht rup se padataa he
 The remaining three are capable of causing all kinds of changes or disorders
 at: teenon kii prachurtaa ke aadhaar par, vibhinn dhaatuon evam unke sanghatakon ko vaat, pitt or kaph kii sangya di gai he
 In general, these three metals also contaminate other metals when they are deformed due to their nutritional value
 at: dosha tathaa mel rup hone se mel kehalaati hai
 There is a deficiency or excess of these three due to any reason in the disease, which is called defect
 dhatudushan- kuch padaarth yaa kaaran aise hote hai jo kisi vishisht dhaatu yaa avyav main hi vikaar karte hai
 They do not affect the whole body
 inhen dhatupradooshak kehete hai
 Aphrodisiac- Those substances which cause special disorder in a particular metal or organ, despite incurring the vata etc
 doshas all over the body, are called amphibia
 kintu in teenon main jo parivartan hote hai ve vaat, pitt yaa kaph in teenon main se kisi ek, do yaa teenon main hi vikaar utpann karte hai
 Therefore, these three doshas are the main body causes, because the changes in their natural proportions also cause distortion in the metals of the body
 rachana main vikaar hone se kriya main bhi vikaar hona swaabhaavik he
 Symptoms like diarrhea, rashes etc
 arise as a result of this unnatural design and action and only a group of these symptoms is called disease
 is prakaar jin padaarthon ke prabhaav se vaat aadi dosha main vikrutiyaan hoti hai tathaa ve vaataadi dosha, jo shaareerik dhaatuon ko vikrut karte hai, donon hi hetu yaa nidaan kehalaate hai
 Ultimately, it is necessary to consider two other important distinctions: purvokt kaarnon se utpann vikaron kii pahchaan jin sadhano dwaara hoti he unhen ling kehete hai
 It has four distinctions: preform, form, attainment and upanayana
 purvarup- kisi rog ke vyakt hone ke purv sharir ke bheetar hui atyalp yaa aarambhik vikruti ke kaaran jo lakshan utpann hokar kisi rogvishesh kii utpatti kii sambhaavna prakat karte hai unhen purvarup kehete hai
 Roop - The symptoms that give a clear introduction to disease or pathology are called Roop
 samprapti : kis kaaran se koun sa dosha swatantra rup main yaa paratantr rup main, akele yaa duusare ke saath, kitne ansh main or kitni maatra main prakupit hokar, kis dhaatu yaa kis ang main, kis-kis swaroop kaa vikaar utpann karata he, iske nirdhaaran ko samprapti kehete hai
 This has important utility in medicine
 vastut: in parivartanon se hi jvaradi rup main rog utpann hote hai, at: inhen hi vastav main rog bhi kaha ja saktaa he or inhen parivartanon ko dhyaan main rakhkar kii gai chikitsa bhi safal hoti he
 Excision and supplementation - when there is a doubt in deciding the actual causes or forms of diseases due to deficiency or narrowness etc
, then to overcome that doubt, one of the possible defects or disorders is to avoid appropriate disorders of dieting and medicine
 In the discussion of anabolism which benefits from using it, Ayurvadacharyo has given six types of dietary and drug experiments, giving the formula of 18 distinctions of Upasya
 Is described
 ye sutara itane mahatv ke hai ki inamen se ek-ek ke aadhaar par ek-ek chikitsapaddati kaa udai ho gaya he; jaise, Appendicitis and appendicitis also help in the identification of disease
 at: inako bhi pracheenon ne "ling' main hi gina he
 Proper and successful treatment is possible only for acquiring knowledge of disease through sex and sex
 hetu or lingon se rog kii pariksha hoti he, kintu inke samuchit gyaan ke liye rogi kii pariksha kerani chahie
 The means of patient examination are four - Optology, Direct, Estimate and Tip
 yogya adhikari, tap or gyaan se sampann hone ke kaaran, shastratatvon ko raag-dwesh-shunya buddhi se asandigdh or yatharth rup se jaanate or kehete hai
 Such scholars, research, experienced, non-partisan and real speakers are known to the great men and their words or writings are called optopadesh
 aaptjanon ne purna pariksha ke baad shastron kaa nirmaan kar unamem ek-ek ke sambandh main likhaa he ki amuk kaaran se, is dosha ke prakupit hone or is dhaatu ke dooshit hone tathaa is ang main ashrith hone se, amuk lakshanonvala amuk rog utpann hota he, usamen amuk-amuk parivartan hote hai tathaa uski chikitsa ke liye in aahaar vihaar or amuk aushadhiyon ke is prakaar upyog karne se tathaa chikitsa karne se shanti hoti he
 Therefore, after studying scripture from first qualified and experienced gurus, there is a tendency for disease, gender and medicine
 shaastravachanon ke anusaar hi lakshanon kii pariksha pratyaksh, anumaan or yukti se kii jaati he
 Psychologically, the senses are said to experience subjects directly
 iske dwaara rogi ke sharir ke ang pratyang main honevaale vibhinn shabdon kii pariksha kar unke swaabhaavik yaa aswabhaavik hone kaa gyaan shrotrendriya dwaara karnaa chahie
 Knowledge of color, shape, length, width, etc
, and knowledge of shadows etc
 should be acquired by the eyes, knowledge of smells, olfactory and sensation of cold, hot, rough, balsamic and pulse, etc
 by the sensory
 rogi ke sharirgat ras kii pariksha swayan apni jeebh se karnaa uchit na hone ke kaaran, uske sharir yaa usase nikle swead, mutr, rakt, pus aadi main cheentee laganaa yaa na laganaa, mackhiyon kaa aana or na aana, coy yaa kute aadi dwaara khaanaa yaa na khaanaa, pratyaksh dekhakar unke swaroop kaa anumaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Knowledge gained through rational reasoning is inference
 jin vishyon kaa pratyaksh nahin ho saktaa yaa pratyaksh hone par bhi unke sambandh main andeh hota he vahaan anumaan dwaara pariksha kerani chahie; yatha, pachanshkti ke aadhaar par agnibal kaa, vyaayaam kii shakti ke aadhaar par shaareerik bal kaa, apane vishyon ko grahan karne yaa na karne se indriyon kii prakruti yaa vikruti kaa tathaa isi prakaar bhojan main ruchi, aruchi tathaa pyaas evam bhay, shok, krodh, ichha, dwesh aadi maansik bhaavon ke dwaara vibhinn shaareerik or maansik vishyon kaa anumaan karnaa chahie
 The aforesaid subunit is also a matter of conjecture
 iskaa arth he yojana
 Seeing the origin of a specific work from the community influence of many causes, what is imagined by the corresponding ideas is called yukti
 jaise khet, jal, jutai, beej or ritu ke sanyog se hi paudha ugta he
 Smoke is always associated with fire, that is, where there is smoke there will be fire
 isi ko vyaptigyaan bhi kehete hai or isi ke aadhaar par tark kar anumaan kiya jaataa he
 In this way, the diagnosis, form, form, acquisition and treatment of all these community considerations justifies the decision of the disease
 yojana kaa duusari drushti se bhi rogi kii pariksha main prayog kar sakate hai
 For example, if a subject is not easily admissible in any sense, it is also intrinsic in the device to accept that subject with the help of other mechanical devices
 purvokt lingon ke gyaan ke liye tathaa roganirnay ke saath saadhyataa yaa asaadhyataa ke bhi gyaan ke liye aptopadesh ke anusaar pratyaksh aadi parikshaon dwaara rogi ke saar, tatv, sahanan, pramaan, satmya, aaharshakti, vyaayaamashakti tathaa aayu ke atirikt varna, swar, gandh, ras or sparsh ye vishay, shroatra, chakshu, ghran, rasan or spashendriya, satv, bhakthi, shaich, sheel, aachaar, smriti, akruti, bal, glani, tandra, aarambh, guruta, laghutaa, sheetaltaa, ushnata, mriduta, kaathinya aadi gun, aahaar ke gun, pachan or maatra, upaay, rog or uske purvarup aadi kaa pramaan, updrav, chaaya, pratichhaya, swapn, rogi ko dekhne ko bulaane ke liye aae doot tathaa raste or rogi ke ghar main pravesh ke samay ke shakun or apshakun, grahyog aadi sabhi vishyon kaa prakruti tathaa vikruti kii drushti se vichaar karte hue pariksha kerani chahie
 Especially pulse, stool, urine, tongue, word, touch, eye and shape should be carefully examined
 ayurveda main naadee kii pariksha ati mahatv kaa vishay he
 Only by examining the pulse, the knowledge of the nature of diseases, etc
, along with defects and witchcraft, is attained by experienced physicians
 jin sadhano ke dwaara rogon ke karanbhoot dosha evam shaareerik vikrutiyon kaa shaman kiya jaataa he unhen aushadh kehete hai
 These are mainly of two types: wasteful and liquid
 adravyabhoot aushadh vah he jisamen kisi dravya kaa upyog nahin hota, jaise upwas, vishram, sona, jaagnaa, tahalnaa, vyaayaam aadi
 External substances used in the body by external or internal experiments are liquid medicine
 ye dravya sankshep main teen prakaar ke hote hai : Like the body, all these matter are also five physical, they also have the components which belong to the body
 at: sansar main koi bhi dravya aisa nahin he jiskaa kisi na kisi rup main kisi na kisi rog ke kisi na kisi avasthavishesh main aushadharup main prayog na kiya ja sake
 But before using them, knowledge of their natural properties, ritualistic properties, method and experiment is necessary
 inamen kuch dravya dosha kaa shaman karte hai, kuch dosha or dhaatu ko dooshit karte hai or kuch swasthvruth main, arthath dhaatusamya ko sthir rakhane main upyogi hote hai, inaki upyogita ke samuchit gyaan ke liye dravyon ke paanchabhautik sanghatakon main taratamya ke anusaar swaroop, guruta, laghutaa, rukshata, snigdhata aadi gun, ras, vapak, veery, prabhaav tathaa maatra kaa gyaan aavashyak hota he
 Not all matter is always useful in the body in its natural forms
 rog or rogi kii aavashyaktaa ke vichaar se sharir kii dhaatuon ke liye upyogi evam satmyakaran ke anukool banane ke liye; in dravyon ke swaabhaavik swaroop or gunon main parivartan ke liye, vibhinn bhautik evam rasinic sanskaron dwaara jo upaay kiye jate hai unhen "kalpana' kehete hai
 Such as Swaras, Kalk or Churna, Cold Booth, Booth, Infusion and Arishta, Oil, Ghrita, Avleh etc
 and refining of minerals, etc
 chikitsak, parichaayak, aushadh or rogi, ye chaaron milakar shaareerik dhaatuon kii samta ke uddeshy se jo kuch bhi upaay yaa kaary karte hai use chikitsa kehete hai
 It is of two types: preventive and prohibitive; Just as the natural defects and metals of the body are not dissimilar and the tradition of equilibrium should remain constant, the therapy done for this purpose is preventive and the actions or remedies which create symmetry in the disordered body metals are called prohibitive therapies
 pun: chikitsa teen prakaar kii hoti he : It is clearly mentioned in the Gita - Mind and human cause, Bandhamokshyo: 7 - If not only mental, but also in the treatment of many physical diseases, if a human being is motivated, then there is hopeless success
 isamen man ko ahit vishyon se rokna tathaa harshan, aashwaasan aadi upaay hai
 Many people have defeated serious diseases on the strength of their self-confidence
 atev ek safal chikitsak rogi ke aatmbal ko viksit karne kaa prayaas karata he
 In this, these measures are like devaradhan, chanting, havan, puja, recitation, vrat, and wearing of gem, mantra, yantra, gemstone and medicine, etc
, as a result of suppression of defects etc
 rog or rogi ke bal, swaroop, avasthaa, swasthya, satv, prakruti aadi ke anusaar upyukat aushadh kii uchit maatra, anukool kalpana aadi kaa vichaar kar prayukt karnaa
 There are also three main types of it: internal scouring, external scouring, and weapons
 iske bhi do mukhya prakaar hai : The remedies for excluding physical defects are called Shodhan, its five remedies, Virechan, Vasti, Anusana and Uttravasti, Shirovirechan and Raktamokshan, these are the five measures
 shaman-lakshanik chikitsa : vibhinn lakshanon ke anusaar dosha or vikaron ke shamanarth vishesh gunwali aushadhi kaa prayog, jaise jvaranashak, chhardighn, atisarhar, uddipak, pachak, hridy, kushtaghn, balya, vishaghn, kashar, shwasahar, dahprashamak, sheetaprashamak, mutral, mutravishodhak, shukrajanak, shukravishodhak, stanyajanak, swedal, raktasthapak, vednahar, sangyaasthaapak, vay:sthaapak, jeevaneey, brunhniya, lekhneey, medneey, rukshneey, snaheneey aadi dravyon kaa aavashyaktaanusaar uchit kalpana or maatra main prayog karnaa
 The following things should be kept in mind while using these medicines: jaise abhyang, snaan, lep, dhupan, swedan aadi
 In different stages, one or several of the following eight types of weapons have to be performed: inke atirikt utpaatan, kuttan, manthan, dahan aadi upshastrkarm bhi hote hai
 Preparation before the preamble is called premedication, such as the patient’s refinement, preparation, purification of instruments, weapons, and the necessary cotton, cloth, bandage, melted butter, oil, decoction, coat etc
 during and after the armament
 vaastavik shastrkarm ko pradhan karm kehete hai
 After shakarma, refinement, Rohan, planting, dermatization, achromatization, Romogenesis etc
 are the remedies
 shastrasadhay tathaa anya anek rogon main kshar yaa agnipryog ke dwaara bhi chikitsa kii ja sakati he
 Leech, horny, tubi, pruning and venation are used to extract blood
 man bhi aayu kaa upadan he
 When the mind of the aforesaid Raja and Tama are corrupted by these two doshas, deteriorating mental balance also has an effect on the senses and body
 sharir or indriyon ke swasth hone par bhi manodosh se manushya ke jivan main astavyastata aane se aayu kaa hraas hota he
 For his treatment, due to the formation of the mind, along with physical purification, etc
, knowledge, science, sobriety, psychomotor, healing, reassurance, etc
 should be treated
 man ko kshobhak aahaar-vihaar aadi se bachanaa chahie tathaa maanas-rog-visheshgyon se upachaar karana chahie
 The senses - they are considered physical in Ayurveda
 ye sharirashrith tathaa manoniyantrit hoti hai
 Therefore, their diseases are treated on the basis of body and mind
 aatma ko pehle hi nirvikaar bataaya gaya he
 We have a feeling of disorder in the governing soul of all these, if there are disorders in its means and basis
 kintu purvakrit ashubh karmon parinamswaroop aatma ko bhi vividh yoniyon main janmagrahan aadi bhavabandhanrupi rog se bachaane ke liye, iske pradhan upkaran man ko shuddh karne ke liye, satsangati, gyaan, vairaygy, dharamshastrachinthan, vrath, upwas aadi karnaa chahie
 With this and yama-niyam, etc
 Yoga is practiced, due to the creation of memory, salvation is attained through rituals
 ise naishthiki chikitsa kehete hai
 Because the world is duality, where there is happiness there is sorrow as well, so the ultimate happiness is only when duality is free and that is called salvation
 vistrut vivechan, vishesh chikitsa tathaa sugamawa aadi ke liye ayurveda ko aath bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he : ye aath ang ye hai- kaaychikitsa, shalyatantra, shalakyatantra, comarbhrity, agadtantra, bhootvidya, rasayanatantr or vajikaran
 It is usually treated by drug use
 pradhanat: fever, raktpitta, shosh, unmaad, apsmaar, kusht, prameh, atisar aadi rogon kii chikitsa iske antargat aati he
 The Shastrakar has defined it as- vividh prakaar ke shalyon ko nikaalane kii vidhi evam agni, kshar, yantra, shastr aadi ke prayog dwaara sampadit chikitsa ko shalya chikitsa kehete hai
 Removal of parts of trunk, pieces of wood, pieces of stone, dust, iron pieces, bone, hair, nails, surgery, unclean blood, poo, dead bones etc
 from any ulcer and the use of instruments and weapons and diagnosis of ulcers, And its treatment etc
 have been included under surgery
 gale ke upar ke angon kii chikitsa main bahudhaa shalaka sadrush yantron evam shastron kaa prayog hone se ise shaalakyayantra kehete hai
 Under this, treatment of diseases arising mainly in the organs of mouth, nasal, eye, ear etc
 comes
 bacchon, striyon visheshat: garbhini striyon or vishesh streerog ke saath garbhavigyaan kaa varnan is tantra main he
 It describes various real, movable and artificial poisons and their symptoms and treatment
 isamen devadhi grahon dwaara utpann hue vikaron or uski chikitsa kaa varnan he
 In order to avoid the symptoms of old age for a long time, the measures to get the best health, strength, strength and longevity and to overcome the disorders arising due to old age are described in this system
 shukradhatu kii utpatti, pushtataa evam usamen utpann dosha evam uske kshay, vruddhi aadi kaarnon se utpann lakshanon kii chikitsa aadi vishyon ke saath uttam swasth santonotpatti sambandhi gyaan kaa varnan iske antargat aate hai

 Linguists place it in their own Japanese-language family
 ye do lipiyon ke mishran main likhi jaati hai : kanji lipi or kaana lipi 
 This language has a large system of respectful words and a "pitch-system" is necessary in speaking
 isamen kai shabd chini bhashaa se liye gayi hai
 No definite opinion has been established so far as to which language is included in the Japanese language
 parantu yah spasht he ki japani or korian bhashaaon main ghanishtha sambandh he or aajkal anek vidwaanon kaa mat he ki korian bhashaa altike bhashaakul main sanmilit kii jaani chahie
 The Japanese language also has many pronunciation and grammatical features that are similar to other Altaï languages, but these characteristics are still not quite understood in which we can say with certainty that the Japanese language is one of the Altaic languages
 hiku isaki pramukh kavy vidha he
 When the Japanese language starts, nothing can be said with certainty due to lack of evidence in this regard
 teesri shatabdi main likhi gai ek chini pustak main japan ke kuch sthanon or logon ke naam milte hai jinase anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki us samay japani bhashaa kaa vikaas ho chukaa tha
 In the 7th-8th century the Japanese learned the Chinese language and script, and history, geography, etc
 were written in the Chinese language
 dhire dhire chini lipi main japani bhashaa likhane kaa upaay khoj nikaala gaya
 The earliest collection of poems in Japan, Manyosheu, was written in this way
 chini bhashaa ke shabd ekmaatrik hote hai
 For this reason, it was very easy to reveal the pronunciation of the Japanese language with each of its scriptmarks
 is prakaar kii lipiyon ko "manyo" lipi kehete hai
 The study of these scripts showed that there were eight types of vowels and vowel analogies in the Japanese language of that time
 ab bhi cocoro, atama aadi shabdon kii bhanti ek hi swar se bane anek shabd he
 Japan's own culture developed as swapping with China ceased
 bhashaa main swar anurupata kaa lop ho gaya or swaron kii sankhya keval paanch rah gai
 Japan's own two types of scripts became "hiragana" and "katakana" by simplifying Chinese scripts
 hiraagaana chini lipi ko saral karke banaai gai
 Initially this script became especially popular among women
 chini lipi ko na milakar keval usee lipi main bhashaa likhi jaati thi
 a book written in Katakana Chinese was made to read like Japanese
 praaia: chini lipi chihn kaa ek bhaag lekar uskaa nirmaan hua tha
 From the beginning, this script was written in conjunction with Chinese scripts
 is samay china ke madhyam se japan main sanskrit bhashaa or lipi kaa adhyayan bhi aarambh ho gaya tha
 The alphabet of the new Japanese scripts was created in imitation of the Sanskrit alphabet
 is samay kaa raajnneetik centre pashchimi japan tha
 The arrival of soldiers from East Japan led to a change in language, especially pronunciation
 is samay senapatiyon kii shakti bad gai or kuch samay tak tokio ke nikat kamakura raajnneetik centre raho
 Due to many battles in this period, the tradition of ancient language started to break down and there was a big change in pronunciation and grammar
 is kaal ke antim bhaag main europe ke log lage or isai mat ke prasar ke uddeshy se unhone japani bhashaa kaa adhyayan kiya
 His written grammar and dictionary are available
 unki likhi anek pustakon se us samay kii japani bhashaa kaa haal acchhee bhanti janaa jaataa he
 At the same time printing developed and books of medicine etc
 were printed in Buddhism, Confucianism
 parantu chini bhashaa main likhi pustaken adhik chhaapi gayi or japani main likhi pustakon kii sankhya kam rahi
 Till this period, we can say the age of ancient language; But at the end of this time the language changed to the form of modern language
 is prakaar main samrat ke sthaan par tokugava parivaar ke log rajya karne lage, tokio rajdhani ho gaya tathaa jagiradaari paddati drudh ho gai
 Osaka was initially a cultural center, but by the late 18th century "edo" became a cultural center
 sahitya adhiktar edo kii boli main hi likhaa jane laga
 Many dialects developed during this period due to the country being divided into jagirs and the opportunity for people to come out
 uccharan aadhunik bhashaa kii bhanti ho gaya or vyakaran main kriya ke rupaparivartan ke niyamon kaa saral hona prarambh hua
 Initially, speakers of different dialects were gathered in Edo, but gradually their own dialect of Edo city developed
 yah or bhi viksit hokar aajkal kii sarvamaanya bhashaa ban gai he
 At this time, the study of ancient Japanese language and literature began to be studied a lot
 is samay se hirkaana main chini lipiyon ko adhik milakar likhane kii paddati pasand kii jane lagi
 During this period, the emperor himself began to rule, and Tokyo became the capital
 yahan kii boli sarvamaanya bhashaa maani jane lagi
 Contact with Europe was established and many words of Europe were translated into Chinese script and started becoming popular among the masses
 chini lipiyon ke atyadhik prayog main aa jane ke kaaran ek hi uccharanwale anek shabd ban gaye
 The translation of European literature led to the development of new styles in the language
 1887 se bolchaal kii bhashaa main sahitya shighrata ke saath lokapriy hota gaya
 Books of knowledge science have been written from left to right instead of being written from top to bottom in the writing style
 yah pravriti aajkal or bhi bad rahi he or dwitiya mahayuddh ke baad sarkari aagyaptr bhi bain se dayee ore likhe jate hai
 Now the promotion of the common language through the medium of magazine, radio, television etc
 is growing very fast and the language of Tokyo was understood and spoken in every corner of the country
 meji kaal ke aarambh main adhik prayog main ai chini lipiyon ko kam karnaa, chini lipi ko laghu rup main likhnaa, hirkaana or katakana ke prayog main ekarupata se aana, roman lipi prayog kaa adhyayan karnaa aadi aadi upayon se bhashaa ko yathasambhav saral banane ke liye praytn kiya ja rahaa he
 Since 1946, when the new constitution of Japan was written combining Hiracana and Chinese scripts, almost the same measures are being adopted in almost all the newspapers
 videshi shabdon ke uccharan kii nakal karte samay katakana kaa prayog hota he
 Some people use Katakana for typewriters but it has not become popular so far
 japani samaaj main bhartiya samaaj jaisi visheshtaon ke hone tathaa bhashaa ke bahut puraani hone ke kaaran japani bhashaa main anek boliyaan hai
 Jin has main Kyushu
 pashchimi japan tathaa purvi japan kii boliyo main, visheshkar unke uccharan main spasht antar he
 Because of the promotion of education since Meji period, the language of the most common language in every region is understood as the dialect of Tokyo
 kshetreey boliyon ke atirikt peshey, stri purush, ucch varg nimna varg aadi ke bhed se bhinn bhinn boliyaan boli jaati hai
 Along with each type of distinction above, each Japanese has to speak in three types of style, with the distinction of the great minor of the hearer, as well as the distinction of the great minor of each hearer
 apane se chote yaa baraabar ke logon se bolte samay da prakaar kaa vaakya, kuch bade se bolte samay desu prakaar kaa tathaa bahut aadar se baaten karte samay gozaimasu prakaar kaa vaakya bananaa padataa he
 In the written language also there are both Aru and Arimasu styles
 swar : a i u e o Consonants: Being always pronounced with a vowel is not just a consonant script
 vyanjan swar vaali lipi nimnlikhit he : Why should you ga gi gu ge go gy gu gyo Shi shi se so shy shyu shyo ja ji ju je jo jya ju jyo Ta chi tsu te to ch chyu jyo da de do Na Ni Nu Ne No Ny Nyo ha hi hu he ho ha hu hyo There are no special script marks for voicing
 aghosh lipi chihn par hi do nukte lagaae jate hai
 When the Japanese script was made, there were no accents such as Kykyu Kyo
 ye baad me chini bhashaa ke prabhaav se apanaae gaye hai
 Therefore, they are revealed by putting lowercase letters after the original script
 upar likhit uccharan ke atirikt do or hai : For n jab pakkaa, acha jaisaa shabd ho k ch k ch ko bhi ek maatra samajhate hai
 To reveal this volume, the small letter Tasu writes
 japani shabd sangitatmak swaraghaat ke hai
 There are very few types of accent
 chaar matraavaale shabdon main nimnlikhit keval chaar prakaar ke bhed hai
 The Japanese language has many words with the same pronunciation and different meanings
 swaraghaat main bhi un shabdon main bhed bataane kii shakti nahin he
 There is no difference in pronunciation of kami and kami
 ham keval unki chini lipi ko dekhne se hi donon kaa bhed jaan sakate hai
 But it tells the word group well in accented sentences
 nivaano sakuro mo minna chite shiritta Vatakushi and Nihongo no Benkyo o Shite Orimasu is prakaar ek vaakya main shabdon kaa sthaan sanyog se hindi se bahut miltaa he
 But some features are worth noting because the Japanese language is additive rather than coincidental
 sangya main vibhaktiyon kaa prayog nahin hota
 Supportive words or auxiliary verbs are used to indicate the relation of noun in a sentence
 upar ke vaakya main "main" ko prakat karne ke liye "vatakushi" main koi rupaparivartan nahin hua he
 The auxiliary word "V" is used to express the subject factor
 sangya main lingabhed nahin he, parantu manushya, jaanavar aadi chetan or achetan vastuon main kuch bhed he
 There is no distinction in the form of a noun, but in a later verb, there is a distinction in the form of a singular plural
 aadar athwa namrata prakat karne ke liye sangya main upsarg "o" lagaaya jaataa he
 Such as: Tegami xxrep 8 
 Letter otegaami xxrep 7 
 aapkaa patr There are different words to say with respectable, with equal, small-scale people or politely
 in shabdon kaa samuchit prayog karnaa bahut kathin he jaise main ke liye
 Vatakushi Hriday especially says women
 purush bhi bado ke saamne namrata prakat karne ke liye is shabd kaa prayog karte hai
 Airplane vashi, boku, ore, Atai: Little Girls kriya main rupaparivartan hota he
 a word is of two or more quantities
 1 kriya main ek visheshta mieru kichoeru jaise shabd hai jo keval achetan vastuon ke sambandh main prayukt kiye jate hai
 Like Hindi, verbs are formed by introducing a noun like - shippatsu suru parantu is prakaar kii kriyaaon ke sambandh main ek visheshta yah he ki jab aisi kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, kabhi kabhi "suru" lagaakar vaakya purna kiya jaataa he
 Like Rokuji Kisho
 shichiji shippatsu
 
 kuroi, aki, jaise ikraant ore shijukana, genkina, jaise nakaarant do prakaar ke shabd hai
 Adjectives also change like verbs
 manushya, jaanav aadi jeev jantu or achetan vastuon ke ginaney kii reeti bhinn bhinn he : The auxiliary word does not change form
 shabdon ke rup bahut chote hote hai hri adhiktar ek matraavaale
 Words longer than three volumes are too short
 ye shabd hindi ke sambandhbodhak tathaa samuchhyabodhak shabd kii vibhakti or kriyavisheshan kaa kaam karte hai
 The words used to refer are: ram ga yuki masu
 Tegmi o Yomu roku ni ni oriru The conjunctive tax, c keredomo, shi, are four words
 aasa vaa hayi shi, yoru va osoi shi, Taihenda takalif he The words independent and paratantra are divided into words
 paratantr shabd adhiktar ek se chaar matraaon ke hote he parantu do teen paratantr shabd ek saath bhi lagaae ja sakate he
 There are four volumes more in independent words and the original parts are written in Chinese script and the changing parts are written in Hiraka
 chini lipiyon ko adhik lagaakar bahut bade, bade, kabhi kabhi 10-15 matraaon ke shabd bhi banaae ja sakate hai
 But due to the choice of three to four words, it is preferred to cut short any part of Chinese scripts and make short words like "nihon Kyoshokuin Kumiyi" instead of "nikkyoso" because of the many words being made in this way
 Words of utterance and many meanings are found very much
 chini shabd athwa chini lipiyon ko jodakar japan main bane shabd japani bhashaa main atyant mahatv kaa sthaan rakhte hai
 Some 10 percent of the words used in today's newspapers are such words
 chini lipiyon main likhe shabdon ko padhane main ek badi kathinaayee yah he ki ek ek lipi ke liye teen bhinn uccharan hai
 The reason is that Chinese scripts differed in the reigns of "kan" Rajkul, "go" Rajkul and "so" Rajkul in China, and that the Chinese language continued to influence the Japanese language in all three periods
 is prakaar chini uccharan ke anusaar padhane ke liye teen bhed hai
 In addition, when these scripts are used for their native words in Japan, these Chinese scripts are read in Japanese pronunciation according to their own meaning
 is prakaar kabhi kabhi ek chini lipi saat aath prakaar se padhi jaati he
 In the Meiji period when foreigners began to have influence in Japan, words like Club, Bucket, Blanket, Romantic, Tobaco were either written in Chinese script for their pronunciation or their meaning
 parantu aajkal aise shabd adhiktar katakana main likhe jane lage hai
 There are five per cent of such foreign words in modern Japanese language
 in videshi shabdon main udyog-vyavsaay ke yantron ke naam, kapade aadi rahan-sahan sambandhi shabd or khel kud ke shabd adhik hai
 English and American words are the most among these
 chikitsa, tatvagyan, pahaado kii chadhaai ke sambandh main germany se, kala ke sambandh main francisi se, sangeet ke sambandh main italid se adhik shabd liye gaye hai
 Foreign words combined with Chinese language do not have variations
 jab kriya banani hoti he, aise shabdon ke baad suru lagaaya jaataa he, jaise sin suru

 padmavati yaa padmini chittod ke raja ratnasingh kii rani thi
 The historical existence of the name of this Rajput queen is very doubtful, and its historical existence has often been accepted as imaginary by historians
 is naam kaa mukhya strot malik mohammad jaaysi krit 'padmavat' naamak mahakavy he
 All the other historical sources or texts which describe 'padmavati' or 'padmini' are all successors of 'padmavat'
 itihaas granthon main adhiktar 'padmini' naam sweekaar kiya gaya he, jabaki jaaysi ne spasht rup se 'padmavati' naam sweekaar kiya he
 It is clear from Jaisi's description that he also means 'padmini' with the highest rank of women
 jaaysi ne spasht likhaa he ki raja gandharvasen kii solah hajaar padmini raniyaan thim, jinamein sarvshereshth rani champavati thi, jo ki pataraani thi
 Padmavati was born from this Champavati's womb
 is prakaar katha ke praathmik strot main hi spasht rup se 'padmavati' naam hi sweekrut hua he
 According to Jayasi, Padmavati was the daughter of King Gandharvasen of Sinhala Island, and Raja Ratan Sen of Chittor, disguised as a yogi, went there and married her after many years of effort and brought her to Chittor
 vah adwitiya sundari thi or ratansen ke dwaara niraadrit kavi-pandit-tantric raghav chetan ke dwaara uske rup kaa varnan sunakar dilli ke sultan allaudin khilji ne chittorgarh par akraman kar diya tha
 Even after 8 months of war, Alauddin Khilji could not conquer Chittor, then returned and after a second attack, he tricked King Ratansen with deceit and asked for Padmavati as a condition of returning him
 tab padmavati kii ore se bhi chal kaa sahaara liya gaya or gora-badal kii sahaayta se anek veeron ke saath vesh badalakar palakiyon main padmavati kii sakhiyon ke rup main jaakar raja ratansen ko mukt karaayaa gaya
 But as soon as this trick was detected, Alauddin Khilji launched a strong attack, in which almost all the Rajput warriors who went to Delhi were killed
 raja ratansen chittod lautaa parantu yahan aate hi unhen kumbhalaner par akraman karnaa padaa or kumbhalaner ke shaasha devpal ke saath yuddh main devpal maaraa gaya parantu raja ratansen bhi atyadhik ghayal hokar chittod lautaa or swarg sidhaar gaya
 There again Alauddin Khilji was attacked
 rani padmavati anya solah sau striyon ke saath johar karke bhasma ho gayi tathaa kile kaa dwaar khol kar ladate hue saare rajput yoddha maare gayi
 Alauddin Khilji did not find anything other than ashes
 karnal tod ne apane rajasthan ke itihaas main jaaysi ke ukt kathanak main kuch her-pher ke saath praayah usee kahani ko doharaaya he
 Colonel Todd's description has remained historically very low mainly due to writing based on the stories of the Bhatas
 unhone raja ratnasingh yaa ratansen ke badale bhimasi kaa naam diya he or vah bhi vastutah rana nahin balki rana lakhamasi ke chachaa the jo ki lakshmana singh ke bachche hone ke kaaran shashan sambhaal rahe the
 Colonel Tod reckons the beginning of Bhimsingh's rule as Laxman Singh and his patron in 1275 AD; While it is well known that Alauddin Khilji was attacked in 1303 AD
 isi prakaar karnal tod ne padmini ko sinhal dweep ke chouhan vanshi hamir shankh kii ladki batalaaya he
 Except for these changes, the rest of the story is often Padmavat, with exceptions
 14 veen or 16 veen shatabdi ke bich jain granth- nabinandan jenudhar, chitai charitra or rain sehara ne rani padmini kaa ullekh kiya he
 Tejpal Singh Dhama has proved her the princess of Sri Lanka on the basis of texts published from Jaffna in her famous research novel Agni Ki Flames
 inaki kahani jaaysi ke padmavat se thodi alag he
 There has been considerable churn among historians for the attacks of Rani Padmini, Raja Ratnasinh and Alauddin Khilji
 is sandarbh main sarvaadhik uddhrut tathaa pramanbhoot mahamahopadhyaay rhibahadur gaurishankar hirachand ojha kaa mat mana gaya he
 In the context of the story of Padmavat, Ojha ji has clearly written that "in the absence of history, people have considered Padmavat as a historical book, but in reality it is a poetic tale of today's historical novels, whose body is composed on these historical things
 That Ratansen, the king of Chittor, Padmini or Padmavati was his queen and Alauddin was the Sultan of Delhi, who fought with Ratansen and took away the fort of Chittor
 bahudhaa anya sab baaten katha ko rochak banane ke liye kalpit khadi kii gai he; kyonki ratnasingh ek baras bhi rajya karne nahin paaya, aisi dasha main yogi ban kar us kii sinhaladweep tak janaa or vahaan kii rajkumaari ko byaah laana kaise sambhav ho saktaa he
 At that time, the king of Sinhala Dweep should not be Gandharvasen, but the king Kirtinishshank Dev should be Parakramabahu or Bhuvanak Bahu
 sinhaladweep main gandharvasen naam kaa koi raja hi nahin hua
 Kumbhalner was not even inhabited by that time, so how should Devpal be considered the king of there? After fighting for Chittor for 8 years, Alauddin did not return to Delhi disappointed but after fighting for six months, he had taken Chittor, he had climbed Chittor only once, so the story of the second coming is fictitious
 " Thus, it becomes clear that finding historicity in the legend of the epic Padmavat epic is meaningless to a great extent
 kuch naam aitihaasik avashya hai, parantu ghatnaayen adhikanshtah kalpit hi hai
 Some events which are historical are also related to 1531 AD rather than 1303 AD
 isi prakaar karnal tod kaa varnan bhi kaaphi had tak anaitihaasik hi he
 In this context, Ojha ji has a clear statement that "colonel Tod has written this story especially on the basis of the Bhatas of Mewar and the Bhats have taken him from 'padmavat'
 bhaaton kii pustakon main samar singh ke peeche ratnasingh kaa naam na hone se taad ne padmini kaa sambandh bhimsingh se milaayaa or use lakhamasi ke samay kii ghatana maan lee
 According to the statements of such Bhats, Tad also wrote Lakhmsi to be the child and the king of Mewar, but Lakhmsi was neither king of Mewar nor child, but was feudatory of Sisode and had reached old age at that time, because he To pay his salt with seven sons, he was killed while fighting in the battle with Alauddin as the head of Ratnasinha's army, as in Shilale of Kumbhalgarh of Vikram Samvat 1517
 Has been told above
 isi tarah bhimasi lakhamasi kaa chachaa nahin, kintu dada tha, jaisaa ki rana kumbhakarna ke samay ke 'eklingamahatmaya' main paaya jaataa he
 In such a situation, even Tad's statement cannot be credible
 'padmavat', 'tarikh phirishta' or taad ke rajasthan ke lekhon kii yadi koi jad he to keval yahi ki allaudin ne chittod par chadhaai kar chah maas ke ghere ke ananthar use vijay kiya; vahaan kaa raja ratnasingh is ladaai main lakshmanasingh aadi kai saamanto sahit maaraa gaya, uski raani padmini ne kai striyon sahit johar kii agni main pranahuti di; is prakaar chittod par thode-se samay ke liye musalamaanon kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 Everything else is often imagined
 " The majority of the above quoted opinion of Ojha ji has been accepted by almost all historians
 dow0 laal ne bhi apni pustak 'history of the Khaljis, main likhaa he ki kahani ke paramparaagat varnan ko taak par rakhane ke pashchaat nagn satya yah he ki sultan allaudin ne 1303 isvi main chittod par akraman kiya or aath maah ke vikat sangharsh ke pashchaat use adhikrut kar liya
 The brave Rajput warriors stayed in the field fighting the invaders and the brave Rajput women were buried in the flame of Jauhar
 jo striyaan samadhisth huin, unamem sambhawatah ratnasingh kii ek rani bhi thi, jiskaa naam padmini tha
 Apart from these facts, everything else is a literary structure and there is no historical support for it
 isi prakaar kaa mat dow0 es0 el0 nagori evam jithesh nagori kaa bhi he
 It has been considered the first school of Chittor
 kaha jaataa he ki khilji ne kile par apni vijay pataakaa fahraakar vahaan ke 30,000 nagarikon ko maut ke ghat utaara
 Many historians have rejected both Padmini's name and existence; But after enough consideration, many historians like Dr
 Ashirwadi Lal Shrivastava and Dr
 Gopinath Sharma have accepted the existence of Padmini, considering many things in the story as unnatural, as expressed in the above opinion of Ojha ji
 dow0 gopinath sharma ne likhaa he ki "hamaare vichaar se yah maananaa kii padmini kii katha parampara jaaysi ke padmavat se aarambh hoti he vah sarvatha bhram he
 The Chitaicharit, which was written many years before Jayasi, describes the Chittor invasion of Padmini and Alauddin
 hemratan ke gora-badal chaupai main; tathaa labdhoday ke padmini charitra main is katha ko swatantra rup se likhaa gaya he
 


 This story has come in the form of a pure and healthy tradition according to a Rajput system, it is not right to reject it easily
 ho saktaa he ki kai baaten paath bhed se tathaa varnan style se vibhinn rup main prachlit rahi hon, kintu unka aadhaar satya se hatakar nahin dhundha ja saktaa
 The architecture testifies that there are palaces of Padmini in Chittor and that of Padmini Tal which still reminds of that elaborate and controversial woman
 padmini ke sambandh main di gayi sabhi ghatnaayen sambhavtah satya kii kasuti par thik nahin utren, kintu padmini kii vidyamanata, akraman ke samay uski sooyeeboojh, uske dwaara johar vrath kaa netritv aadi ghatnaon kaa ek swatantra mahatv he

 There is no doubt that Alauddin's main intention for the Chittor invasion was political, but when he came to know about the beauty of Padmini, the desire to take him became more intense

 He was opposed to revivalism
 punarutthanavaad kii simaaon ko rekhaankit karte hue unhone apane ek lekh main likhaa tha ki- There is nothing exuberant and extravagant in Ranade
 He refused to reap cheap notoriety by playing the part of an extremist
 He refused to mislead people by playing upon and exploiting the patriotic sentiments of the people
 He refused to be a party to methods which are crude, which have volume but no effect, and which are neither fool-proof nor knave-proof, and which break the back even of the most earnest and sincere servants of the country and disable them from further effort
 In short, Ranade was like the wise captain who knows that his duty is not to play with his ship clever and masterful tricks, just for effect and show in the midst of the ocean, but to take it safely to its appointed port
 In short, Ranade was not a forged bank note and in worshipping him we have no feeling of kneeling before anything that is false
