 Dr
 Jagdish Chandra Basu was a famous scientist of India who had deep knowledge of Physics, Biology, Botany and Archeology
 ve pehle vaigyanik the jinhone radio or sookshm tarangon kii prakaashiki par kaary kiya
 He made many important discoveries in botany
 saath hi ve bharat ke pehle vaigyanik shodhakartta the
 He was the first scientist from India to receive an American patent
 unhen radio vigyaan kaa pita mana jaataa he
 He also wrote science stories and is considered the father of Bengali science fiction
 british bharat ke bengal praant main janme basu ne saint zavier mahavidhyalay, kalakatta se snaatak kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 He then went to London for medical education, but due to health problems he had to leave this education in the middle and return to India
 inhone phir presidency mahavidhyalay main bhautikee ke praadhyaapak kaa pad sambhala or jatigat bhedbhaav kaa saamana karte hue bhi bahut se mahatvapurn vaigyanik prayog kiye
 He made extraordinary progress in sending wireless signals and first started using semiconductors to capture radio messages
 lekin apni khojon se vyavsaayik laabh uthaane kii jagah inhone inhen saarvajanik rup se prakashit kar diya taaki anya shodhakartta inpar aage kaam kar saken
 After this, he made many discoveries in botany
 inhone ek yantra crescograph kaa avishkaar kiya or isse vibhinn uttejkon ke prati paudhon kii pratikriya kaa adhyayan kiya
 In this way, they proved that there is a lot of similarity between flora and animal tissues
 ye patent prakriya ke bahut viruddh the or mitron ke kehane par hi inhone ek patent ke liye aavedan kiya
 In recent years, their contributions to modern science are again being recognized
 basu kaa janm 30 navambar 1858 ko bengal main dhaka jile ke faridpur ke memansingh main hua tha
 His father Lord Chandra Basu was a leader of the Brahmo Samaj and was a sub-magistrate or Assistant Commissioner in Faridpur, Bardhaman and elsewhere
 inkaa parivaar raarikhal gaanv, bikrampur se aayaa tha, jo aajkal bangladesh ke munshiganj jile main he
 By the age of eleven, he was educated in a school in the village
 basu kii shiksha ek bangla vidhyalay main prarambh hui
 His father believed that his mother tongue should be well versed before learning English
 vikrampur main 1915 main ek sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue basu ne kaha- "us samay par bacchon ko angreji vidyalayon main bhejnaa haisiyat kii nishaani mana jaataa tha
 In the Bengali school i was sent to, i used to sit on my right side, the son of my father's Muslim attendant and on my left the son of a fisherman
 ye hi mere khel ke saathi bhi the
 i listened to their stories of birds, animals and aquatic animals
 shaayad inhen kahaniyon ne mere mastishk main prakruti kii sanrachana par anusandhan karne kii gahari ruchi jagaai
 "after schooling, he moved to Calcutta and joined St
 Xavier's School
 jagadish chandra bose kii jeev vigyaan main bahut ruchi thi or 22 varsh kii aayu main chikitsa vigyaan kii padhai karne ke liye landan chale gaye
 But due to poor health, he gave up the idea of becoming a doctor and went to Christ's College, Cambridge, and there, a famous professor of physics, Father Lafont, inspired Bose to study physics
 varsh 1885 main ye swadesh laute tathaa bhautikee ke sahaayak praadhyaapak ke rup main presidency college main padhaane lage
 Here he stayed until 1915
 us samay bhartiya shikshakon ko angrej shikshakon kii tulana main ek tihaai vetan diya jaataa tha
 This was opposed by Jagdish Chandra Bose and continued to work for three years without pay, due to which his condition deteriorated and he was severely indebted
 is karj ko chukaane ke liye unhen apni pushtaini jameen bhi bechni padi
 Jagdish Chandra Bose won the fourth year and was given full salary
 bose ek achche shikshak bhi the, jo kaksha main padhaane ke liye bade paimaane par vaigyanik pradarshnon kaa upyog karte the
 Some students of Bose like Satendra Nath Bose later became famous physicists
 british saidhantik bhautik vigyaani james clerk maxwell ne ganitiya rup se vividh tarang dairdhya kii vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi, par unki bhavishyavaanee ke satyaapan se pehle 1879 main nidhan unka ho gaya
 British physicist Oliver Lodge demonstrated the existence of Maxwell waves by transmitting them with stars in 1887â€“88
 german bhautikashastri henrik hertz ne 1888 main mukt antariksh main vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv ko prayog karke dikhaaya
 Subsequently, Lodge continued Hertz's work and gave a memorable lecture in June 1894 and published it in book form
 loj ke kaam ne bharat ke bose sahit vibhinn deshon ke vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 The first notable aspect of Bose's microwave research was that he brought the wavelength to the millimeter level
 ve prakaash ke gunon ke adhyayan ke liye lambii tarang dairdhya kii prakaash tarangon ke nuksaan ko samaj gaye
 In 1893, Nikola Tesla performed the first public radio communications
 ek saal baad, kolkata main navambar 1894 ke ek saarvajanik pradarshan dauraan, bose ne ek millimetre range microwave tarang kaa upyog barood duuri par prajvalit karne or ghanti bajaane main kiya
 Lieutenant Governor Sir William mckenzie witnessed Bose's performance at the Calcutta Town Hall
 bose ne ek bengali niabandh, 'adrishy alok' main likhaa tha, "adrishy prakaash aasaani se eent kii deevaaron, bhawanon aadi ke bheetar se ja sakati he, isliye taar kii bina prakaash ke madhyam se sandesh sanchaarit ho saktaa he
 "popov did one such experiment in Russia
 bose k "dabl apvartak crystal dwaara bijli kii kirnon ke dhruvikaran par" pehla vaigyanik lekh, loj lekh ke ek saal ke bheetar, may 1895 main bengal kii aciatic socity ko bheja gaya tha
 His second article was sent to Lord Royal in London in October 1895 by Lord Rayleigh
 disambar 1895 main, landan patrika electrician ne bose kaa lekh "ek nae electro-polariscope par" prakashit kiya
 At that time the term 'coherer' coined by Lodge in the English-speaking world was used for Hertz's wave receiver or detector
 electrician ne tatkaal bose ke 'kohirar' par tippanee kii
 
 The commentary quoted from the English magazine Electrician is: bose "apane kohirar" ko behtar karne kii yojana banaai lekin yah patent ke bare main kabhi nahin sochaa
 Bose conducted his experiments at a time when radio was developing as a contact medium
 radio microwave optics par bose ne jo kaam kiya tha wo radio communication se judaa hua nahin tha, lekin unke dwaara kiye hue sudhaar evam unke dwaara is vishay main likhe hue tathyon ne duusare radio avishkaarakon ko zarur prabhavit kiya tha
 In the late 1894 era, Guglielmo Marconi was working on a radio system that was being designed specifically for wireless telegraphy
 1896 ke aarambh tak yah pranali physics dwaara bataaye gaye range se zyaada duri main radio signlles transmit kar rahi thi
 Jagadish Chandra Bose was the first scientist to find out what the semiconductor junction was used to detect radio waves and discovered many microwave components in this method
 iske baad agle 50 saal tak millimetre lambaai kii electromagnetic tarango par koi shodh kaary nahin hua tha
 In 1897, Bose described his research on millimeter waves at the Royal Institution in London
 unhone apane shodh main vevagids, horn antena, daai -electric lens ,alag alag posraiser or semiconductor jinaki frequency 60 ghz tak thi -- unka istemaal kiya tha
 All these devices are still present at Bose Institute, Kolkata
 ek 1
3 mm multibeam resiver jo kii erizona ke NRAO 12 meter telescope main hai, acharya bose 1897 main likhe hue research paper ke siddhanto par banaaya gaya hai
 Sir Neville Mott received the Nobel Prize in 1977 for his research work in Solid State Electronics
 unhone yah kaha tha kii acharya jagadish chandra bose apane samay se 60 saal aage the
 In fact, it was Bose who predicted the existence of P-type and N-type semiconductors
 biophysics ke kshetra main unka sabase bada yogadan yah tha kii unhone apan dikhaaya kii paudho main uttejnaa kaa sanchaar vaidyuthik madhyam se hota hai naa kii chemical madhyam se
 These claims were later proven to be true through scientific proyogo
 acharya bose ne sabase pehle microwave ke vanaspati ke tishyu par hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 He studied the effect of changing weather on plants
 iske saath saath unhone rasinic inhibitors kaa paudhon par asar or badalte hue taapmaana se hone vaale paudhon par asar kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 By analyzing changes in cell membrane potential under different conditions, they came to the conclusion that plants are sensitive "they can feel pain, feel affection, etc
"
 bose ne alag alag dhaatu or paudhon ke tishyu par fatig rispance kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya tha
 He stimulated different metals by mixing electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal methods and noted the similarities of the cell and metal reaction
 bose ke prayogo ne simulated koshikao or dhaatu main chakree fatig pratikriya dikhaai thi
 Along with this, special cyclic fatigues and recovery responses were also studied for different stimuli in living cells and metals
 acharya bose ne badalte hue electrical stimuli ke saath paudhon badalte hue electrical pratikriya kaa ek graph banaaya, or yah bhi dikhaaya kii jab paudhon ko zehar yaa anaesthetic di jaati hai tab unki pratikriya kaam hone lagati hai or aage chalakar shunaya ho jaati hai
 But the zinc metal did not show this reaction when it was treated with oxalic acid
 1917 main jagadish chandra bose ko "nite" kii oopaadhi pradaan kii gai tathaa sheeghra hi bhautik tathaa jeev vigyaan ke liye royal sosayadi landan ke faillo chun liye gaye
 Bose had done all his research without any good equipment and laboratory, so Jagdish Chandra Bose was thinking of making a good laboratory

 The Indian numeral system is known as hindu-arabic numeral system in the countries of the west because European countries had knowledge of this numeral system from the Arab country
 jabaki arabon ko yah gyaan bharat se mila tha
 The Indian numeral system consists of 10 digits totaling zero
 bhartiya ank pranali, sansar kii sarvaadhik prachlit ank pranali hai
 According to the famous French mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace, neeche bhartiya ankon kaa devanagari evam antararashtriya swaroop dikhaaya gaya he- According to historians, Brahmi numerals were prevalent in India in the fourth century BC
 pune evam mumbai ke kshetra kii gufaaon main mili shilalekhon main tathaa uttar pradesh main mili prachinkaal ke sikkon main brahmi ank paye gayi hai
 The decimal system and zero were not used in Brahmi numerals
 apramanik dastavezon ke anusaar bharat main shunya, jo ki dashamalav pranali kaa aadhaar he, kaa avishkaar isvi san kii pratham shatabdi main ho chukaa tha
 However, authentic documents of the invention of zero have been found in India only in the fifth century
 gwalior main paye gayi shilaalekh, jo ki isvi san 870 kaa he, main shunya ke sanket paae gaye hai
 This inscription has been recognized by all historians by one opinion
 shunya ke avishkaar ho jane par bharat main das anko vaali ank pranali kaa prachlan armbh ho gaya jo ki is sansar main prachlit aadhunik ank pranaaliyon kaa aadhaar bani
 In the seventh century CE, Arabia acquired the Indian numeral system
 arab main bhartiya ankon ko gubaar ank or bhartiya ank pranali ko hindusa ank pranali ke naam se janaa jane laga
 Due to the number system obtained from Hindustan, it was named 'hindusa' there
 arab ke mohammad ebn musa al-khwaarizmi naamak vidwaan ke kalkram vivaran ke anusaar, Roman numerals were used in Europe until the twelfth century
 roman ank pranali main keval saat ank hai, jo aksharon dwaara vyakt kiye jate hai
 These are I, V, X, L, C, d and M
 inhen anko ke jod ne ghataane se koi bhi sankhya likhi jaati he
 For example, if you want to write three then write the symbol of one three times III
 aath likhnaa he to paanch ke daayin taraf teen ek-ek ke chinh likhakar jod die or VIII ho gaya
 This system is so difficult and complicated that when Europe was introduced to the Indian numeral system in the twelfth century, it not only accepted it, but adopted it completely
 europe main kuch shatabdiyon baad jo vaigyanik-audyogic kranti hui, uske mul main bhartiya ank gananaa kaa hi yogadan he
 India invented nine digits and zero for calculation
 yahi nahin, ankon ke sthaneey maan kaa bhi avishkaar bharat main hi hua
 There is no value of zero, but if it is written to the right of a digit, it will indicate ten because now the local value of 1 becomes ten
 yadi dahini ore ek or shunya badha diya jaae, to yah sankhya sau ho jaaegi
 In this way, the valueless zero when written to the right of the digit increases the value of the second digit
 sankshep main, sthaan ke anusaar ankon ke mulya nirdhaaran ke siddhanth ko sthaneey maan kehete hai
 It is very easy to write any number from this system
 jis teen sau chavalis ko ham roman pranali main CCC XL IV likhte hai, use bhartiya vidhi se 344 likh sakate hai
 Through this, the largest number can be written briefly without any difficulty
 bhartiya ganit ne dashamalav pranali kaa bhi avishkaar kiya
 The first use of decimal digits in India is found by Aryabhatta I
 sambhav he ki iskaa avishkaar isse bhi bahut pehle hua ho
 But in Europe, the general publication of decimal numbers was done in the seventeenth century, whose knowledge he had definitely gained from India
 ye bhartiya ganitiya siddhanth europe ko arab ke madhyam se praapt hue the
 In Arabic language these numbers are called Hindsa
 hindasa arthath 'hind se praapt'
 The Arabic script is written from right to left, but in Arabic the digits are written from left to right
 yah bhi is baat kaa pramaan he ki arabi ankon kii utpatti arabi bhashaa ke saath arab desh main nahin hui, apitu ye baahar se aayaat kiye gaye hai
 When these Indian numerals reached Europe through the Arabs, they felt that these numbers were invented originally by the Arabs
 atev aaj bhi europe main ek se nau evam shunya ke bhartiya ankon ko â€˜erebic neumralâ€™ kehete hai
 In the former Arab country of Islam's prophet Hazrat Mohammed, Jihalia means 'the age of ignorance'

 kint islam kii sthapana ke saath arab samrajya kaa vistaar pishcham main spain or uttari africa tathaa purv main bharat kii seemaa tak ho gaya
 The Arab system of calculation, which was of very preliminary level, proved inadequate for the economic administration of the countries that were defeated and joined the Arab Empire
 atev vivash hokar arabi shaskaon ko vijit jatiyon ke ankon kaa prayog karnaa padaa
 During the reign of Khalifa al-mansur, some emissaries from Sindh went to Baghdad, including some scholars
 ve apane saath brahmagupta rachit brahmasfoot siddhanth evam khandakhadyak naamak granth bhi anya granthon ke saath baghdad le gaye
 With the help of these scholars, al-fajari and Yakub Khan Tariq translated them into Arabic, which had a special effect on Arabic mathematics
 arab logon main bhartiya gyaan, vigyaan or kala ke prati jo us samay sammaan tha, vah al jahij kii pustika- fakir assam-sudan al-l binad main likhaa haih Leonado of the city of Pisa, who learned Hindu mathematics from a Moore and wrote a book called Liber Avaiki in 1202, revised edition in 1228
 isamen usne hindu ankon or unki upyogita ko samajhaayaa
 The books of Alexandre de Viladi and Jan Aq Halifax also disseminated the 'hindu numeral system'
 prarambh main iskaa virodh hua, kint pandrahavin shatabdi ke madhya tak europe ke sabhi deshon ne inako sweekaar kar liya tha
 Other European countries learned the Indian numeral system from Arabia
 chunki unhen yah ank pranali arab se mili thi isaliye unhone iskaa naam 'arabi ank pranali' rakh diya
 After having a good knowledge of history, it is now being called 'hindu-arabic numeral' or 'hindu numerology' or 'indian numerology'
 samay samay main tathaa desh desh main bhartiya ank pranali ke ankon ke sanket main anek parivartan huye
 In the end, these numbers became in the form of 0, 1, 2, 3, xxrep 4 
 and they got international recognition
 aadhunik ank evam ank pranali vastav main bhartiya hi hai
 Presently, these modern numerals are known as the "international form of Indian numerals"

 Some researchers have considered non-linear communication to be as large as 80 percent of the total communication, while it may be only 50-65 percent
 Various studies have found it to be of different importance, some of which suggest that communication is usually done through facial expressions, ie, the facial expressions are the only means of communication on 4

 After this, Prabhakarvardhan gets his name

 It is very difficult to equate Narvardhan with Pushpabhuti

 As a result of the military, scientific, political, economic, and cultural influences of the United States in the first half of the 19th century and the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries of the British Empire, it has become a common language in many parts of the world
 kai antarrashtriya sanghathanon or rashtramandal deshon main bade paimaane par iskaa istemaal ek dwitiya bhashaa or adhikarik bhashaa ke rup main hota he
 Historically, the English language has its origins in several dialects, now called Old English, introduced by the anglo-saxon people who settled in England since the early 5th century
 viking hamalaavaron kii pracheen norse bhashaa kaa angreji bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he
 After the Norman Conquest, Old English developed into Middle English, for which Norman vocabulary and spelling rules were heavily used
 vahaan se aadhunik angreji kaa vikaas hua or abhi bhi isamen anek bhashaaon se videshi shabdon ko apnaane or saath hi saath nae shabdon ko gadhane kii prakriya nirantar jari he
 The formation of a large number of English words, especially technical words, is based on the roots of ancient Greek and Latin
 aadhunik angreji, jisko kabhi - kabhi pratham vaishvik saamaanya bhashaa ke taur par bhi varnit kiya jaataa he,sanchaar, vigyaan, vyapaar, vimaanan, manoranjan, radio or kootneeti ke kshetron kii pramukh antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global
 yah sanyukt rajya america kii pramukh bhashaa he
 Since the Second World War, the recognition of America as a global superpower and its increasing economic and cultural influence has brought significant momentum in the spread of the English language
 angreji bhashaa kaa kaam chalau gyaan anek kshetron, jaise kii chikitsa or computer, ke liye ek aavashyaktaa ban chukaa he; parinamswaroop ek arab se zyada log kam se kam buniyadi str kii angreji bol lete hai 
 yah sanyukt rashtraki chah aadhikarik bhashaaon main se bhi ek he
 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition
 isi prakaar aitihaasi bhashavid, jo kii bhashaa parivartan kii jatilta or gatishiltaa se avgat hai, angreji bhashaa dwaara alag bhashaaon ke ek nae parivaar kaa nirmaan karne kii isaki aseem sambhaavnaaon ke prati hameshaa avgat rahete hai
 According to these linguists, the reason for this is the huge size of the English language and the spread of communities using it and its natural internal diversity, such as its creoles and pizzins 
o english ek west jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-fritian or loar sexn boliyon se hui he
 These dialects were brought to Britain in the 5th century by German nomads and Roman auxiliary armies from various parts of present-day northwestern Germany and northern Netherlands
 in jarmenic janajatiyon main se ek thi engles, jo sambhawatah angton se aaye the
 Bead has written that his entire country, except his old land, had come to Britain

 Initially Old English was a group of diverse dialects that reflected the diversity of the anglo-saxon states of Great Britain
 inamen se ek boli, let west sexn, antat apana varchasv sthapit karne main safal hui
 mul puraani angrezi bhashaa phir akraman kii do laharon se prabhavit hui

 doosraa 11 veen sadi ke normans the, jo kii puraani norman bhashaa bolte the or isaki anglo-norman namak ek angreji kism kaa vikaas kiya
 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks
 scandinaviens ke saath sahanivaas ke parinamswaroop angreji bhashaa ke anglo-frisian kor kaa shabdic anupuran hua; baad ke norman kabje ke parinamswaroop bhashaa ke germanik kor kaa sundarikaran hua, isamen romance bhashaaon se kai sundar shabdon ko samavisht kiya gaya
 This Norman influence entered English mainly through the courts and the government
 is prakaar, angreji ek "udhaar" kii bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui jisamen lacheelaapan or ek vishaal shabdaawalee thi
 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world
 paanchavin or chhathi sadi main britain ke dwipon par uttar kii ore se angel or sexn qabeelon ne hamalaa kiya tha or unhone keltic bhashaayen bolne vaale sthaneey logon ko scotland, ireland or wales kii ore dhakel diya tha
 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise â€“ dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers
 lekin iskaa rup badal kar shart ho gaya
 Later both the words started to be used in different meanings and are happening till date
 san 500 se lekar 1100 tak ke kaal ko puraani angrezi kaa daur kaha jaataa he

 This period of English continued from 1100 to 1500 and this period of English expansion is called medieval English

 angreji bhashaa indo-europea bhashaa parivaar ke germanik shakha ke pashchimi up-shakha kii sadsy he
 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots
 inke baad anya jarmenic bhashaaon kaa number aata he jinka naata thodaa dur kaa he, ve hai, pashchimi europea bhashaayen or uttari jarmenic bhashaayen or farois
 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge
 anya jarmenic bhashaaon ke saath angreji ke shabd bhandaran main antar kaa mukhya kaaran angreji main badi maatra main latin shabdon kaa upyog he or french ) german or angreji kaa vaakyavinyas bhi angreji se kaaphi alag he, vaakyon ko banane ke liye alag niyam hai 
 shabdaarth vigyaan angreji or uske sambandhiyon ke bich juthi dostiyon kaa kaaran he
 Differences in phonics also blur basically related words, and sometimes both phonetics and semantics are different
 1500 sau se zyada varshon se angreji main yogic shabdon ke nirmaan or maujuuda shabdon main sudhaar kii kriya apane alag andaaj main, germanik bhashaaon se pruthak, chal rahi he
 For example, abstract nouns can be formed by adding suffixes like -hood, -ship, -dom, -ness to native words in English
 lagbhag sabhi jarmenic bhashaaon main in sabhi ke sajaateey pratyay maujuud hai lekin unke upyog bhinn ho gaye hai, jaise kii german "free-hit" banaam angreji "free-dam" An English speaker can also read many French words easily because there is a large amount of adjustment of French and Norman words in English
 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 The former is sometimes called BBC English, a clan noted for its inclination towards "received pronunciation"; It follows the Cambridge model

 Apart from these two major dialects, there are several varieties of English, most of which include several sub-types, such as Cockney, Scouse and Geordie under British English; Newfoundland English under Canadian English; And African American Local English and South American English under American English
 English is a multi-centric language and does not have a central language authority like the 'acedimia francai' of France; Therefore, no one type is considered "right" or "wrong"

 paaramparik prakaaron ke uccharan, vyakaran or shabd bhandar angreji kii anya kismon se bhinn, kabhi kabhaar baari maatra main, hai
 Due to the widespread use of English as a second language, there are different types of accents of its speakers, which reveal the local dialect or language of the speaker
 kshetreey lahazon kii adhik vishisht visheshtaon ke liye 'angreji ke kshetreey lahazon' ko dekhen or kshetreey boliyon kii adhik vishisht visheshtaon ke liye angreji bhashaa kii boliyon kii soochi ko dekhen

 udahaaran ke taur par, aashcharya athwa vyangy vyakt karnaa, yaa ek vaktavy ko prashn main badalanaa
 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups
 tone samoohon ko ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, is kaaran se inaki lambaai simit rahati he
 These are on average five words long and are finished in about two seconds
 udhaaharan ke liye : English is a very spoken language
 shabdon or vaakyon, donon ke kuch shabdaanshon ko uccharan ke samay apekshaakrit adhik mahatva / jor miltaa he jabaki anya ko nahin
 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable
 newclear shabdaansh vaktaa ke mukhya bindu kaa varnan karata he

 anya bhashaaon kii apeksha angreji bhashaa main aawaaj ko unchaa or nicha karne kaa mahatva kahin adhik he
 Speaking in a low voice indicates certainty and speaking in a loud voice indicates uncertainty
 This can have a significant impact on meaning, especially in showing positive or negative attitudes; Speaking in a low voice means your "vision is known" and a rising voice means "vision unknown"
 haan / nahin vaale prashnon kii chadhati hui aawaaj ke peeche bhi yahi he
 for example: swar prayek kshetra main bhinn bhinn hote hai
 Where symbols are visual in pairs, the first corresponds to the common American pronunciation of American English, the second corresponds to the received pronunciation of British English

 Speech and aspirations of stop consonants in English depend on dialect and context, but only a few general rules can be given: anya indo-european bhashaaon kii tulana main angreji main nunatam mode hote hai
 For example, modern English, unlike modern German or Dutch and romance languages, lacks gender grammar and adjective agreement
 cese marking bhashaa se lagbhag gaayab ho chuki he or aaj iskaa istemaal mukhya rup se sarvnaam main hi kiya jaataa he
 The form of strong versus weak verbs derived from Germanic origin has gained importance in modern English and the use of curved remains has increased
 varttman main bhashaa adhik vishleshnatmakaban gayi he or arth spasht karne ke liedyotak kriya or shabd kram jaise sadhano kaa vikaas hua he
 Auxiliary verbs denote questions, negativity, passive voice and progressive aspects

 Apart from this, there are many negative words in English

, many animal names and many common Activities jarmenic shabd angreji ke latin shabdon se zyada chote hote hai or saamaanya bolchaal main inkaa upyog zyada aam he
 It includes almost all the basic pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, denotative verbs etc
 that make up the basic syntax and grammar of English

 Most Latin words are commonly used in formal speech or writing, such as a court or an encyclopedic article
 However, there are other Latin words that are commonly used in general colloquial and do not appear to be too formal; These words are primarily for concepts that no Germanic word has survived

 The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition contains more than 6 million definitions, following the overall policy: It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang 
 The editors of Webster's third new international dictionary, without layoffs, estimate this number to be much higher in his preface
 aisa anumaan he kii lagbhag 25,000 shabd har saal bhashaa main judate hai
 One consequence of the French influence is that the English vocabulary has been somewhat divided into Germanic and Latin words
 angreji ke 1000 sabase aam shabdon main se 83% or 100 sabase aam main se puure 100 jarmenic hai
 Conversely, most of the more advanced words in subjects like science, philosophy, mathematics come from Latin or Greek

 The spelling system, or orthography, is multi-layered
 isamen sthaneey jarmenic pranali ke upar french, greek or latin vartanee ke tatv shaamil hai; bhashaa ke dhwani vigyaan se yah kaaphi hat gaya he
 There is often a considerable difference in the pronunciation and spelling of words
 haalaanki akshar or dhwani algaav main mail nahin khate hai, phir bhi shabd sanrachana, dhwani or lahazon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaye gaye vartanee niyam 75% vishwasaneey hai
 Some phonetic spelling advocates claim that English is more than 80% phonetic
 haalaanki anya bhashaaon kii apeksha angreji main akshar or dhwani ke bich sambandh utana pragadh nahin he; udahaaran, dhwani anukram ough ko saat bhinn prakaaron se uccharit kiya ja saktaa he
 The result of this complex orthographic history is that reading can be a challenging task
 greek, french or spanish or kai anya bhashaaon kii tulana main, ek chaatr ko angreji pathan kaa paarangat banane main zyada vakt lagata he
 Only consonant letters are pronounced in a relatively regular way: adhikansh jarmenic bhashaaon ke vipareet, angreji main dyacritics, sivaay videshi udharshabdon ke, lagbhag nahin ke baraabar hai or do swaron ke uccharan ko ek dhwani kii bajaay pruthak darshane ke liye diarisis nishaan ke asaamaanya upyog main 
debor, cafe, resyum, entry, fiansi or nive jaise shabd aksar donon tareekon se likhe jate hai
 The diacritics are often added to the word to denote them of "high order"

 One of these is Basic English, formed by Charles K
 Ogden with limited words and describes it in his book Basic English: a General Introduction with Rules and Grammar

 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English
 ogden ne basic english main aisa koi shabd nahin daalaa jise kuch anya shabdon ke saath bolaa ja sake or anya bhashaaon ke vaktaaon ke liye bhi ye shabd kaam karen, is baat kaa bhi usne khyaal rakhaa

 Soon after the Second World War, it received a lot of publicity as a tool for world peace
 Although it was not converted into a program, other similar versions were created for various international uses

 sarlikrut angreji main anumodith shabdon kaa ek shabdkosh he or un shabdon ko kuch vishisht myanon main hi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he

 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 Meiosis is a special type of cell division required for lingual reproduction in eukaryotes
 ardhasuthran dwaara yugmak koshikaaye paidaa hotin hai
 In all organisms including all animals and plants that grow on land, gametes are called egg cells and sperm cells
 yadhyapi ardhasutri koshika vibhaajan kii prakriya or samasutri koshika vibhaajan kii prakriya main bahut kuch samantaayein hai, kintu ardhasutri vibhaajan, samasutri vibhaajan se do mahatvapurn pakshon main alag he- In animals in which bisexual reproduction is prevalent, zoology begins with a coagulated egg
 sansechan kii prakriya main andey ke cendrak or shukranu ke cendrak kaa sayujya hota he or yugmaj banataa he
 The meaning of 'saujya' is that the genetic material has doubled in zygote, because this substance was in one quantity in egg and one in sperm
 yah spasht he ki anuvaanshik padaarth prayek peedi main dvigun nahin hoga
 In the impregnation method, the function of compulsory duplexing in a genetic material is such that at the time of maturation of sexual cells, the number of chromosomes is halved
 yah ek neunkaree vibhaajan hota he arthath is vibhaajan ke pashchaat gunasutron kii sankhya aadhi rah jaati he
 The antecedent of meiosis is stable longer than the antecedent of normal encephalization and can be divided into several subsystems
 ye upavasthaayen nimnlikhit hai : leptotin, zaigotin, Packetin, diplotene and diakinisis
 leptotin avasthaa main cendrak lambey or patale gunasutron se bharaa paaya jaataa he
 Some granules are found somewhere on these formulas, which are called chromomiers
 chromomiaron ke bich ke gunasutron ke bhaagon ko inter chromomerican fibrili kehete hai
 Chromomier has a greater ability to stain than intrachromomeric fibrilli
 zaigotin upavastha main gunasutron kaa yugman hota he
 In addition to sexual chromosomes, the nucleus of an organism has two unitary clusters of chromosomes
 ek kulak main kai gunasutra hote hai, jo saadhaarant: ek duusare se bhinn hote hai
 This means that each type has two chromosomes
 jaisaa upar kaha ja chukaa he, yugmanshu upvastha main gunasutron kaa yugman hota he
 The pairing process is not random, but is very ordered
 yah kriya keval samaan gunasutron ke bich hoti he
 Each chromosome is joined from one end to the other end with its same formula and the chromomiers of the linked formulas connect only to their identical chromomier
 zaigotin avasthaa ke ant tak yugman kii kriya purna ho jaati he
 The companion chromosomes are so close to each other that they appear to be one
 gunasutron ke aise jodon ko dwisanyojak kaha jaataa he
 In pectin subunits the paired formulas of each divisor are so close to each other that there appears to be a formula in looking at the complete divisor
 packitin samay main sarpit sanghanan ke kaaran dwisanyojak chote hone lagate hai or diplotine tathaa dyakinisis samay main dwisanyojak or bhi chote ho jate hai
 Each of the two formulas of a divisor in a diplotene subunit is divided into two formulas
 iskaa fal yah hota he ki prayek dwisanyojak do jodi yugmit sutron se bana paaya jaataa he
 The two formulas resulting from the division of a chromosome are called semiautonomous
 diplotine avasthaa main ye yugmit sutara ek duusare se pruthak ho jate hai, kintu kuch sthanon par ye ek duusare se alag nahi ho pate
 The reason for this is that a semicircle of each side is broken in place and then its segments are joined by both the segments of a broken semicircle of the opposite side
 diplotine avasthaa main yugal ardhasutra ek duusare se sate hote hai or abhimukh yugal ardhasutron se spashtat: dur hote hai, parantu jagah jagah par uparyukt ghatana ke kaaran ek ardhasutra apane yugal ardhasutra kaa saath chhodkar abhimukh paksh ke ardhasutra ke saath sata prathit hota hai
 Such structures are called kizemata
 sutron ke adhik mote ore chote hone ke kaaran dyakinisis main ardhasutron kaa parsparik sambandh sugamawa se nahin dekha ja saktaa or madhyavastha main to gunasutron kaa bhuyishth sanghanan ho jaataa hai, jisase kiagyaeta kii upasthit kaa anumaan kiya ja saktaa hai
 Although each chromosome splits up before the precursor of meiosis, their centromere does not divide even to midlife
 is kaaran vibhajit ho jane ke par bhi prayek gunasutra kii niztaa bani rahati he
 In the posterior phase each chromosome is separated from its partner, that is, both the chromosomes of each divisor are disordered and one of the paired chromosomes moves towards the c pole and the other towards the pole
 is varnan se yah spasht he ki prayek dhruv par gunasutra apni aadhi sankhya main hi pahonchte hai
 The interval state is very short and in some animals it does not happen at all
 antaraal avasthaa kaa ant hone par phir purvavastha kaa prarambh hota he
 Intermediate, thereafter and the order of intercession is the same as in simple summation
 yah upar kaha ja chukaa he ki ardhasuthran main ek ke baad ek, do baar, koshikavibhaajan hota he
 Thus, to specify the distinct separation of the two cell division states, they are called interstitial-1, intermediate-2, interstitial-1, interstitial-2 etc
 yah upar kaha ja chukaa he ki purvavastha se hi prayek gunasutra do ardhasutron main vibhajit ho jaataa he, parantu uskaa santromear avibhajit hi rahata he
 Therefore at chromosome-2 the chromosome divides completely, except for the centromere
 pashchaavastha kaa prarambh hone par centromear do bhaagon main vibhajit ho jaataa he, jiske falswaroop gunasutra ke donon bhaag ek duusare se mukt ho jate hai or abhimukh dhruv kii ore ja sakate hai
 Sexual chromosomes are special chromosomes that pair in one sex but not in the other; For example, Drosophila melanogaster has three pairs of simple chromosomes, called the allele formula and two sexual chromosomes
 maadaa main donon langik gunasutra ek samaan hote hai
 These are called Y-chromosomes
 nar main bhi do ling gunasutra hote hai
 One is a Y-chromosome, which is similar to every female Y-chromosome, but the other is different from the Y-chromosome
 ise r-gunasutra kehete hai
 At the end of meiosis in the female, each cell has four chromosomes â€” three oligosomes and one y chromosome
 prayek usite do baar vibhajit hota he
 Four cells are produced from this
 inamen se teen dhruviya pind hoti he, jinka sheeghra hi naash ho jaataa he or ek paripakv andanu hota hai
 Like the female, each spermatheca is divided twice in the male, producing four spermatids
 ye sparmatid do bhanti ke hote he
 One has three hug formulas and one Y-chromosome and the other has three hug formulas and one Su-chromosome
 yah spasht he ki sparmatid do prakaar ke hote hai, parantu andanu ek hi prakaar kaa
 Each spermatid becomes long and thin, respectively
 isko sparamatozoon kehete hai
 In impregnation, the head of a spermatozoan enters an ovum
 sansechit andanu ko yugmaj kehete hai or chunki shukranu do prakaar ke hote he, at: yugmaj bhi do prakaar ke hote hai
 One category of zygote is female and another category is male
 aisa bhi hota he ki maadaa main do ya-gunasutra hon or nar main keval ek ya-gunasutra
 In such a situation, sex determination is the same as in Drosophila melano-gaster
 nar ke sharir main do prakaar ke shukranu utpann hote hai-ek main aaling sutara ke atirikt ya-gunasutra hota he or duusare main ya-gunasutra hota hi nahin
 There are also animals whose males have many different Y-chromosomes
 ardhasuthran ke ant par do prakaar ke sparmatid banate he
 One type of spermatid has chromosomes Y1, Y2, Y3 etc
 in addition to the oligosome and in the other only the R-chromosome and the oligosome

 saanchaa:goldenglobebestactortvcomedy 1990-2009saanchaa:911ct Vikram Yoga is a system of yoga created by Vikram Chaudhary with traditional yoga techniques and it started gaining popularity in the early 1970s
 vikram kii kakshaen lagbhag 90 minute tak chalati hai or isamen 26 mudraon or 2 saans sambandhi vyaayaamon kii shrinkhalaa kaa ek set puraa karaayaa jaataa he
 The practice of Vikram Yoga is ideally done in a room heated to 105 Â° f and 40% humidity which openly identifies it as a form of hot yoga
 vikram yoga kaa lakshya saamaanya tandoorusti kaayam karnaa he or vikram choudhary yah daawa karte hai ki garm kiya gaya studio tanaav or thakaan ko kam karte hue, gaharaai tak failaav or chot se bachaav kii suvidha detaa he
 Vikram claims that his system stimulates and stimulates every muscle, joint and organ of the body
 shri choudhary ke mutabik, kai log apane fefde kii kshamta kaa keval 50 pratishat tak hi istemaal kar pate hai or is tarah zyada oxigen kii maatra banaae rakhane ke kram main fefdon ko anivaary rup se failaav diya janaa chahie
 In a 2007 interview, Mr
 Chaudhary said that when a person is practicing pranayama, he should eventually be able to increase oxygen conversion and absorption as well as improve blood circulation, as many of the cardiovascular activities Occurs in other formats
 shri choudhary kaa daawa he ki vikram yoga ke dauraan do prakriyaaon ke kaaran rakt parisancharan behad prabhavit hota he jise ekstansion or compresssont kaha jaataa he
 It is said that these two processes work together so that every joint, muscle and organ inside the human body receives fresh oxygen
 kisi vishisht asana kaa abhyaas karte hue abhyaasakarta sharir ke kisi khaas hisse ko failaata or sikodta he, is prakaar parisancharan asthaayee rup se ruk jaataa he
 Due to this obstruction in circulation, the heart has to pump more blood in response to that deficiency
 atirikt maatra main taaja rakt pump kiye jane kii prakriya ko ekstansion kaha jaataa he
 Once the posture is completed and the person comes out of that posture, new oxygenated blood begins to re-circulate in the arteries where it was being compressed
 taaja rakt kii maatra main badlaav or iske teevr pravaah ke kaaran, aisa kaha jaataa he ki sankraman, jeevanu or hanikaarak padaarthon ko is prakriya ke jariye baahar nikaala ja saktaa he
 Other styles of yoga also promote this theory in terms of influence of BKS
 Iyengar's "squeeze and Soak" analogy)
 vikram yoga apane lambey samay se kaayam chikitsakeey phaaydon or paramanand sambandhi prabhaav ke liye vyapak rup se lokapriy he
 The heat maintains the yogic conditions in moisture-rich India that purify the body and flush out its harmful substances, which is why a new "freshness" is often experienced in Vikram Yoga classes
 vikram yoga is sawaal par kaaphi vivaad kaa vishay rahaa he ki kya 100 degree fahrenheit se adhik taapmaana vaale kamare main kathin vyaayaam kaa abhyaas karnaa surakshit he yaa nahin
 It is common for those practicing Vikram Yoga to experience dizziness and nausea
 vikram yoga kaa ek anya vivaadaaspad pahalu kshetreey or rashtriya str par vikram pratispardhaon ke prasar se sambandhit he
 While practitioners of other forms of yoga say that competition is to oppose the idea of peace and unity, Vikram states, â€œcompetition is the basis of every democratic society
 'pratispardhaa' ke bina koi loktantr kaayam nahin hota he
 " sanyukt rajya america main shri choudhary ne is pranali ke abhyaas, adhyaapan or kaarobaar ke zyaadaatar pahaluon main vyapak str par copiriton kaa daawa kiya he or inhen lagu karne ke prati aakraamak rahe hai
 While these claims have not been conclusively resolved, Vikram Chaudhary has secured legal settlements from several yoga teachers and studios
