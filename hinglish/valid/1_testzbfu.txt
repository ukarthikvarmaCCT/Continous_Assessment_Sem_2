 Traumatic events are more subjective
 dardanaak kya he is par nirbhar karata he ki vyakti ko dardanaak lagata he
 Regardless, a traumatic event is an event where something is disturbed that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with stress
 dardanaak ghatnaon ke kaaran hone vaali amliya kaa ek aam udhaaharan vighatnkaaree bhulbhulaiya he, jo tab hota he jab vyakti aisi ghatana ko bhul jaataa he jisane unhen gaharaai se pareshaan kiya he

 Typical causes of amnesia are: Electroconvulsive therapy jisamen chikitsakeey prabhaav ke liye rogiyon main daure vidyut rup se prerit hote hai, donon pratikruti or antrogred amenesia sahit teevr prabhaav ho sakate hai
 Alcohol can both cause blackouts and have a detrimental effect on memory formation
 prakaar Anterograde amnesia is an inability to create new memories due to brain damage, whereas long-term memories are retained before the event
 mastishk kaa nuksaan dirghakaalik sharaab, gambhir kuposhan, stroke, sir aghat, anseflitis, surgery, varnikik-corsacof syndrome, cerebrovascular ghatnaon, anoksia yaa anya aghat ke prabhaavon ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 The two brain regions related to this condition are the medial temporal lobe and the medial diencephalon
 neuronal haani ke kaaran antrogred amenesia kaa aushadhiy tareekon se ilaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 However, treatment exists in educating patients to define their daily routines and after several stages they begin to benefit from their procedural memory
 isi tarah, antrogred amenesia peediton ke liye jivan kii gunvattta main sudhaar ke liye saamaajik or bhaavnaatmak samarthan mahatvapurn he
 Fentanyl use by opioid users has been identified as a possible cause in a group of cases in Boston, MA
 retrogred amenesia amliya kii shuruyaat se pehle yaadon ko yaad karne main asamarthta he
 One may be able to encode new memories after the event
 retrogred aam taur par hippocampus ke alaava mastishk ke kuch hisson main sir ke aghat yaa mastishk ke nuksaan ke kaaran hota he
 The hippocampus is responsible for new memory encoding
 episodic memory arthpurna smriti se prabhavit hone kii adhik sambhaavna he
 The damage is usually due to head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, stroke, tumor, hypoxia, encephalitis, or chronic alcoholism
 pratikruti amenesia se peedit logon ko vishistataaon ke bajaay saamaanya gyaan yaad rakhane kii adhik sambhaavna he
 Recent memories are less likely to be recovered, but becoming stronger over time will make it easier to remember old memories
 retrogred amenesia aamtaur par asthaayee hota he or unhen nuksaan se yaadon ko ujagar karke ilaaj kiya ja saktaa he
 Another type of consolidation occurs over a longer period of time / day, weeks, months, and years and possibly involves more permanent storage sites in the cortex in transferring information from the hippocampus
 is dirghakaalik samekan prakriya kaa sanchaalan hippocample kshati vaale marijon ke retrogred amenesia main dekha jaataa he jo apekshaakrit saamaanya rup se bachapan se yaadon ko yaad kar sakate hai, lekin jab ve amejan banane ke kuch hi varshon pehle hue anubhavon ko yaad karte hai to ve prabhavit hote hai
 Post-traumatic amnesia is usually caused by a head injury
 dardanaak amliya aksar kshanik hota he, lekin yah sthaayee yaa yaa to antrogred, retrogred, yaa mishrit prakaar ho saktaa he
 The extent of duration covered by amnesia is related to the degree of injury and may indicate prognosis for recovery of other functions
 maamuli aghat, jaise car durghatana, jiske parinamswaroop halke wheeplash se adhik nahin hota he, short / dderghaavadhi memory transfar maikenism main thodi der ke baadha ke kaaran durghatana se thik pehle kisi car ke maalik ko kshanon kii yaad nahin aati he
 
 peedit bhi jaan sakate hai ki log koun hai
 Acidity or consciousness prolonged after injury may indicate that recovery from the remaining concussion symptoms will take a long time

 bachapan main amliya apane bachapan se ghatnaon ko yaad rakhane main saamaanya aakshamata he
 Sigmund Freud notoriously attributed it to sexual repression, while modern scientific approaches usually attribute it to aspects of brain development or developmental psychology including language development, which is why people can easily identify pre-language phenomena
 Don't remember shodhakartaaon ne paaya he ki nihit yaadon ko yaad yaa varnit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Remembering how to play the piano is a common example of sole memory, such as walking, speaking and other everyday activities that would be difficult to notice if they were to be released each time they woke up in the morning
 duusari taraf, spasht yaaden, shabdon main yaad or varnit kii ja sakati hai

 lakshan aamtaur par ek din se bhi kam samay tak chalate hai or aksar koi spasht prakshepan kaarak yaa koi anya neurological ghate nahin hote hai
 The cause of this syndrome is not clear
 syndrome kii pariklpana main kshanik kam rakt pravaah, sambhavit jabt yaa migraine kaa ek atoot prakaar shaamil he
 Patients are usually redundant of events more than a few minutes in the past, although immediate recall is usually preserved
 strot bhulbhulaiya yaad rakhane main asamarthta he ki tathyaatmak gyaan ko banaae rakhte hue, kab yaa kaise pehle se siikhaa gaya jaankaree hasil kii gai he
 Korsakoff syndrome can result from chronic alcoholism or malnutrition
 yah vitamin bi 1 kii kami ke kaaran mastishk kii kshati ke kaaran hota he or sharaab kaa seven or poshan pattern sanshodhit nahin hone par pragatisheel hoga
 Other neurological problems are likely to be present in combination with this type of amnesia
 Korsakoff syndrome bhi confabulation se judaa hua janaa jaataa he
 The person's short-term memory may seem normal, but the person may have a difficult time trying to recall the back story, or unrelated words, as well as complex patterns
 drug-prerit emnesia jaanboojhkar ek anaavashyak dawa ke injection ke kaaran hota he taaki rogi ko surgery yaa chikitsa prakriyaaon ko bhuulane main madad mil sake, vishesh rup se purna sangyaaharan ke tahat nahin kiya jaataa he, yaa vishesh rup se dardanaak hone kii sambhaavna he
 Such drugs are also known as "premedicants"
 sabase aam taur par, 2-halojanayukt benjodygepine jaise ki midzolam yaa flunitrazepam pasand kii dawa he, haalanki is aavedan ke liye propophol yaa scopolmine jaisi anya dridhtaa se anaavashyak dawaaon kaa bhi upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The short time-frame memories in which the process was performed are permanently lost or at least significantly reduced, but once the drug is worn, memory is no longer affected
 sthiti-vishisht amliya vibhinn paristhitiyon main utpann ho sakati he jiske parinamswaroop PTSD hoti he

 It has been identified as a treatment-responsive syndrome conducive to anti-epileptic drugs
 amliya ke kai roopon kaa ilaaj kiye bina khud ko thik karen
 However, if this is not the case, there are some ways to deal with memory loss
 in tareekon main se ek sangyanatmak yaa vyavsaayik therapy he
 In therapy, amnesiacs will develop the memory skills they possess and try to regain what they have lost, to learn which techniques help to recover memories or to create new recovery paths
 isamen jaankaree ko vyavasthit karne ke liye ranneetiyon ko or adhik aasaani se yaad rakhane or lambii baatcheet kii samaj main sudhaar ke liye ranneetiyaan shaamil ho sakati hai
 Another coping mechanism is taking advantage of technical support, such as personal digital devices, to keep track of day-to-day tasks
 dawaaon, janmdin or anya mahatvapurn ghatnaon ko lene ke liye, niyuktiyon ke liye anusmarak sthapit kiye ja sakate hai
 Many pictures can also be stored to help remember the names of friends, family and colleagues
 notebook, diwaar calendar, goli anusmarak or logon or sthanon kii tasviren kam takanic memory aids hai jo bhi madad kar sakati hai
 While no drugs are available to treat amnesia, underlying medical conditions can be treated to improve memory
 aisi sthitiyon main mastishk main kam thyroid fnction, yakrut yaa gurde kii beemaari, stroke, avsaad, dwidhruviya vikaar or rakt ke thakke tak simit nahin hai
 wernicke-korsakoff syndrome involves changing this vitamin by consuming thiamine deficiency and thiamine-rich foods such as whole grain cereals, legumes, nuts, lean pork, and yeast
 sharaab kaa ilaaj or alcohol or avaidh dawaaon ke upyog ko rokane se or nuksaan ho saktaa he, lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main khoi hui smriti ko thik nahin kiya jayega
 Although improvements occur when patients receive some treatment, there is no real remedy for amnesia so far
 rogi kitni had tak thik ho jaataa he or kitni der tak mutr jari rahegaa ghaav ke prakaar or gambhirtha par nirbhar karata he
 The French psychologist module-armand Ribot was one of the first scientists to study amnesia
 unhone ribots lau kaa prastaav diya jo kahata he ki retrogred amenesia main samay dhaal he
 The law follows the logical progression of memory loss due to illness
 sabase pehle, ek rogi haal kii yaadon, phir vyaktigat yaaden, or antat bauddhik yaaden kho detaa he
 He implied that the most recent memories were lost earlier
 cese studies ne amnesia kii khoj or mastishk ke kuch hisson kii khoj main badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 The studies gave important insights into how the brain is affected
 adhyayanon ne vaigyanikon ko ek ilaaj yaa rokthaam main amlata or antardrushti ke bare main apane gyaan main sudhaar karne ke sansaadhan bhi die
 There are several extremely important case studies: Henry Molaison, R
B
, and G
D
 henry molison Henry Molaison, formerly known as HM, made people think of memory
 maamle kii pehali baar 1 9 57 main wiliam bichar scovil or brenda milanar dwaara ek paper main report kii gai thi
 He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy due to a bicycle accident at the age of nine
 chikitsak dawaaon ke saath apane daure ko niyantrit karne main asamarth the, isliye neurosrjan scovil ne mastishk surgery se jude ek nae drushtikon kii koshish kii
 He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by performing a temporal lobectomy
 unke mirgee main sudhaar hua, lekin molison ne nai dirghakaalik yaaden banane kii kshamta kho di
 They displayed normal short-term memory capacity
 agar unhen shabdon kii suchi di gai, to vah unhen lagbhag ek minute ke samay main bhul jaaenge
 In fact, he would forget that he was also given a list in the first place
 ek baar molison ne soochiyon ke bare main sochane se roak diya to vah unhen dirghakaalik smriti se phir se yaad karne main asamarth tha
 This gave evidence to researchers that short-term and long-term memory are actually two distinct processes
 bhale hi vah soochiyon ke bare main bhul gaya, phir bhi vah apni antarnihit smriti ke madhyam se chizon ko seekhney main sakasham tha
 Psychologists will ask them to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror
 haalanki vah kabhi bhi us kaary ko kabhi yaad nahin rakh saktaa tha, phir bhi vah baar-baar aisa karne ke baad sudhaar karegaa
 This showed psychologists that he was unconsciously learning and memorizing things
 amenesia ke bare main adhik jaanane ke liye adhyayan molison ke jivan bhar main lagaataar puraa ho gaye
 The researchers conducted a 14-year follow-up study on Molaison
 unhone apni bhulbhulaiya ke bare main or jaanane ke liye do saptaah kii avadhi ke liye adhyayan kiya
 After 14 years, Molaison still could not remember the things that happened after his surgery
 haalanki, vah abhi bhi un chizon ko yaad kar saktaa tha jo oparation se pehle hua tha
 Researchers also found that, when asked, Molaison could answer questions about national or international events, but could not recall his personal memories
 unki mrityu ke baad molison ne apane mastishk ko vigyaan main daan diya, jahaan ve mastishk ke un kshetron ko khojane main sakasham the jinke ghaavon main unki bhul hoti he
 This case study provided important insights for areas of the brain that are affected in anterograde amnesia, as well as how amnesia works
 rogi arabi Patient RB was a generally working person until the age of 52 years
 50 saal kii umr main, use angina kaa nidaan kiya gaya tha or do maukon par dil kii samasyaon ke liye surgery hui thi
 After a hyscic episode that arose from heart bypass surgery, RB showed a loss of anterograde memory with the exception of a few years before his surgery, but almost no loss of retrograde memory, and no sign of any other cognitive impairment
 Not presented unki mrityu ke baad tak shodhakartaaon ko apane dimag kii jaanch karne kaa mauka nahin mila, jab unhen pataa chalaa ki unke ghaav hippocampus ke sie 1 bhaag tak simit the
 This case study underwent significant research involving the role of the hippocampus and the function of memory
 rogi jidi Patient GD was a white male born in 1940 who served in the Navy
 unhen puraani gurde kii vifaltaa kaa nidaan kiya gaya tha or unke baaki ke jivan ke liye hemodialysis upachaar praapt hua tha
 In 1983, he went to the hospital for elective parathyroidectomy
 uske baayen lob main khun kii gambhir haani ke kaaran bhi usne thyride lobatomi choda tha
 As a result of the surgery he started having cardiac problems and became very agitated
 aspataal se reeha hone ke paanch din baad bhi vah yaad nahin kar paaya ki uske saath kya hua tha
 Apart from memory loss, none of his other cognitive processes were affected
 vah zyada shodh main shaamil nahin hona chahta tha, lekin doctoron ke saath memory pareekshanon ke madhyam se, ve yah pataa lagane main sakasham the ki unki mrityu kii samasya agle 9 
5 varshon tak unki mrityu tak maujuud thi
 After his death, his mind was preserved for science, photographs and future study
 adhivaktaa, abhibhaashak yaa vakil ke anek arth hai, parantu hindi main aise vyakti se he jisko nyaayalay main kisi anya vyakti kii ore se uske hetu yaa vaad kaa pratipaadan karne kaa adhikaar praapt ho

 Often, most people do not have the ability, knowledge, skills, or language power to speak their words effectively
 adhivaktaa kii jarurat isi baat ko rekhaankit karti he
 Among other things, the lawyer should be a legal practitioner
 kanoonvid usko kehete hai jo kanoon kaa visheshgy ho yaa jisane kanoon kaa vyavsaayik adhyayan kiya ho
 The role of a lawyer varies greatly in the legal court
 bhartiya nyaaypranali main aise vyaktiyon kii do shreniyan hai : aidwocket tathaa vakil
 Each Territorial High Court has its own rules for the nomination of Advocate under the Indian "bar Council" Act
 ucchtam nyaayalay main namankit aidwocket desh ke kisi bhi nyaayalay ke samaksh pratipaadan kar saktaa he
 a lawyer cannot render before the Supreme Court or the High Court
 aidwocket general arthath mahadhivaktaa shaskeey paksh kaa pratipaadan karne ke liye pramukhatam adhikari he
 The advocate general of Maharashtra is Rohit Dev
 {rajkumaar maury samaaj sevi dwaara kuch mahatvapurn tark }● It is necessary to take care of some important things in order to defend your case, because the lawyer has the responsibility to look into many cases, due to this, the matter becomes lighter due to the fact that the victim is not able to keep the matter
 He is free to keep his post, he can present his point well, he does not need any advocacy debit nor Advocacy degree continues xxrep 4

 jainagam main arihant, siddh, acharya, upaadhyaay evam sadhu yani muni rup paanch parameshthi hi aradhy maane gaye hai
 'om' / 's' is formed when their proto letters are interlinked
 yatha, inamen se pratham parameshthi ‘arihant’ yaa ‘arhant’ kaa pratham akshar ‘a’ ko liya jaataa he
 The second Parameshthi is 'siddha', who is called 'ashiri' by being bodyless
 at: ‘ashariri’ ke pratham akshar ‘a’ ko arihant’ ke ‘a’ se milaane par a+a=‘aa’ ban jaataa he
 In it, the first letter of the third divine 'acharya', after mixing 'aa', Aa + Aa remains 'aa'
 usamen chaturth parameshthi ‘upaadhyaay’ kaa pehla akshar ‘u’ ko milaane par aa+u milakar ‘o’ ho jaataa he
 The last fifth Parameshthi 'sadhu' is also called Muni in Jainagam
 at: muni ke praarambhik akshar ‘m’ ko ‘o’ se milaane par o+m = ‘om’ yaa ‘on’ ban jaataa he
 In the word 'jain' two quantities related to 'A' are made above 'J', 'N' and 'J'
 inke madhyam se hi jain paramparaagat ‘on’ kaa chihn banaaya ja saktaa he
 The simple method of making the symbol of this 'om' can be done in four steps as follows- is prakaar jain parampara sammat yani ‘om’ / ‘on’ kii akruti nirmit ho jaati he
 Many of the idols of the Jain tradition are found in the commendations, instruments, handwritten texts, ancient inscriptions and ancient scripts in the same way as the symbol of 'om' / 's'
 vastut: pracheen lipi main ‘u’ ke upar ‘ref’ ke samaan akruti banane se vah ‘o’ ho jaataa tha
 And with Chandrabindu being used with him, he became 'om' / 's'

 Due to the inadvertence or ignorance of us, this changed in the printing press to make other traditions valid

 At least 8 glasses of fluid is required for the body to work in the prescribed amount, which depends on the ability and age of the person to function
 parantu adhik kaaryshil vyakti ko isse do yaa teen guna adhik taral padaarth kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The fluid that ordinary humans take, replaces the fluid that is required to perform bodily functions
 yadi koi sharir kii aavashyaktaa se kam taral padaarth lete hai, tab nirjaleekaran ho jaataa he
 If there is combustion or damage in the intestines or due to accumulation of germs or viruses, the intestines are producing more fluid than the absorption capacity, then more fluid is released into the intestinal tract leading to dehydration
 is
 peya ke rup main taral padaarth kam maatr main lene kaa kaaran bhukh na laganaa yaa michali hona ho saktaa he
 There can be many reasons for rheumatism, the following are notable: 1
 jalariktata yaa praanrabhik jalhraas - yah manushya ko pani na milane, fever hone, baar baar vaman or dast aane se ho jaataa he
 2
 Decrease in total volume of electrolyte and dissolution of salts - Concentration is kept constant by the cancellation or blocking of water between the extracellular fluids and electrolytes of intercellular fluids
 kul electroliton kii kami yaa vruddhi se sharir main pani kii maatra ghatati yaa badhati rahati he
 3
 Intravenous injection of hyperbolic solution - This increases the blood pressure in the blood temporarily and the tissue flows into the fluid
 baad main badha hua drav vrikk dwaara utsarjit hota he or sharir ke jal main vaastavik hraas hota he
 a reliable symptom of dehydration is rapid weight loss within a few days
 10 pratishat se adhik vajan teji se kam hona gambhir lakshan mana jaataa he
 It is very difficult to separate these symptoms from the actual disease
 saamanytah nirjaleekaran ke nimnlikhit lakshan ho sakate hai
 Excessive thirst, dry mouth, weakness and dizziness, thickening of urine or less urination
 atyadhik nirjaleekaran sharir kaa rasayan hi badal detaa he

 shabbir ahaluwalia ek bhartiya abhinayta hai
 Baiju Bawra was the Dhrupadgayak of India
 unako baijnath prasad or baijnath mishra ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 He was the court singer of Raja Mansingh of Gwalior and a contemporary of Tansen, the great singer of Akbar's court
 unke jivan ke bare main bahut si kinvadantiyaan hai jinaki aitihaasik rup se pushti nahin kii ja sakati he
 Gurubhai Pandit Baijnath of the great 16th-century singer musician Tansen was born into a Brahmin family in Chanderi in 1542 on the night of Sharad Purnima
 pandit baijnath kii balykaal se hi gayan evam sangeet main kaafii ruchi thi
 The sweetness of his throat and the cleverness of singing were impressive
 pandit baijnath ko bachapan main log pyaar se 'baiju' kahkar pukaarte the
 With the age of Baiju, his singing and music also increased
 jab baiju yuva hue to nagar kii kalavati naamak yuvati se unka prem prasang hua
 Kalavati was an inspiration as well as Baiju's beloved
 sangeet or gayan ke saath-saath baiju apni preyasi ke pyaar main pagal ho gaye
 This is why people started calling him Baiju Bawra
 baijnath ne dhrupad style main gayan kii diksha us samay ke mashhoor guru haridas swami se vrundavan main grahan kii thi
 According to historical books preserved at Jai Vilas Mahal in Gwalior, Baiju could burn oil lamps by singing raga lamps, making ragas by singing raga megh, megh malhar, or gaur malhar, feeding flowers by singing raga bahar and even raga Stones could also be melted by singing Malkons
 samraat akbar sangeet evam kala kaa premi tha
 There was a flow of musicians and litterateurs in his court
 tansen akbar ke darbar ke nau ratnon main gine jate the
 Akbar organized a music competition in his court
 is pratiyogita kii yah shart thi ki tansen se jo bhi muqaabala kar jitegaa, vah akbar ke darbar kaa sangeetkaar bana diya jaayegaa tathaa haare hue pratiyogi ko mrityudand diya jayega
 No musician came forward due to this condition but Baiju Bawra took this pledge and took orders from his Guru Haridas and participated in the music competition
 antat is pratiyogita main baiju kii haar hui, kintu baad main akbar ne prasann hokar baiju ko apane darbar main rakhane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 But according to Akbar's court historians Abul Fazl and Aurangzeb's court historian Faqirullah, Baiju had defeated Tansen in the competition and Tansen touched the feet of Baiju and begged for his life
 baiju ne tansen ko maaf kar diya or khud gwalior waapas chalaa gaya
 Baiju Bawra came to Gwalior instead of staying in Akbar's court, where he received information that his Guru Haridas was about to be ordained
 ve apane guru ke antim darshanon ke liye vrindavan pahunche or unke darshan karne ke pashchaat vibhinn prakaar kii aapadaaon kaa saamana karte hue apane jivan ke antim padaav main kashmir naresh kii rajdhani srinagar pahunche
 At that time his disciple Gopal Nayak was a court singer there
 fatehaal baiju ne apane aane kii soochna gopaldaas tak pahunchane ke liye dwarpal se kaha, to dwarpal ne do took jawaab diya ki unke swami kaa koi guru nahin he
 Hearing this, Baiju was shocked and reached a temple in Srinagar and started singing the raga Dhrupad
 baiju ke shreshth gayan ko sunakar apaar bheed umadane lagi
 When the news of Baiju reached the King of Kashmir, he himself came there and welcomed Baiju and brought it to his court
 kashmir naresh ne gopaldaas ko punah sangeet shiksha die jane hetu baiju se nivedan kiya
 With the permission of the king, he trained Gopal again by teaching him music
 ek anya dantakatha ke anusaar gopal nayak baiju kaa priy shishy tha
 He left Baiju with his wife Prabha and went elsewhere for a livelihood due to which Baiju lost his temper and got his name Baiju Bawra
 gopal nayak kashmir naresh ke darbar main gayak niyukt ho gaya or vahaan usne yah prachlit kar diya ki vah swa-shikshit he or us par kisi bhi guru kii krupa nahin he
 Hearing this, Baiju reached Srinagar and fascinated everyone with his singing, but Gopal Nayak refused to recognize his guru
 aahat baiju ek mandir main jaakar gaanaa gane laga or vahaan baari bheed umad padi or jab kashmir naresh ko is baat kii soochna mili to kashmir naresh ne baiju ko apane darbar main bulavaa bheja or baiju or gopal kii sangeet pratiyogita rakhwa daali
 Baiju got a chance to sing first and Gopal had to answer
 baiju ne raag bhimpalasi gaaya jiske kaaran pathar pighalane lage
 Gopal sang to the north but could not win
 pratiyogita kii shart ke anusaar haarane vaale ko mrityudand diya janaa tha lekin baiju baavaraa ne raja se anurodh kar gopal ko mrityudand se bachaa liya
 But Gopal had to lose his life due to his stupidity
 uskaa antim sanskaar satluj ke kinare uski putree mira ne kiya
 It is said that after the cremation, when Gopal's bones were thrown into the river, she drowned
 dantakatha ke anusaar gopal kii vidhwaa prabhaa ne jab baiju se un haddiyon ko laane kaa anurodh kiya to baiju ne gopal kii putree mira ko raag malhaar kaa ek nayaa sanskaran sikhaaya jisko ek saptaah tak seekhney ke baad jab mira ne satluj ke kinare bheed ke saamne jab gaaya to gopal kii haddiyaan nadi ke kinare aa lageen
 Since that time, that raga has been given the name of Meera's Malhar
 is prakaran ke pashchaat udhaas baiju chanderi waapas chalaa aayaa
 Baiju died in Chanderi at the age of 71 on the day of Vasant Panchami at the age of 71 in 1613 AD
 yah maharashtra me godavari nadi ke kinare basaa pracheen nagar tha yah vyavsaayik gaati vidhiyo kaa kendra tha saat vahno ne ise apni rajdhani banaaya abhilekho me ise paithan kaha gaya he The Paramdanava star is a massive mass and glowing star, from which gases, plasma and other matter continuously jump into space in large quantities
 yarkis varnakram shreneekaran main isaki chamak kii shrenee "0" he 
 "paramdanava star" is called "hypergent Star" in English
 paramdanav tara kahalaane ke liye kisi taare ke nirpeksh kantimaan ko -7 magnitude se adhik hona chahie or bahut hi bhimkaay hona chahie
 The spectrum of stars with a very large gasosphere includes a streak called Hα at a wavelength of 656
28 nanometers that is produced by a special excitation of hydrogen gas
 isliye vaigyanik paramdanvon kii pahchaan ke liye unki chamak or Hα kii maujuudagi kii parakh karte hai
 The Supreme Gods have a mass of 100–265 times that of the Sun, that is, a mass of 100–265 M☉
 unki chamak suraj kii chamak se lakhon-karodon guna zyaada hoti he
 The surface temperatures of individual permutations vary greatly from 3,500 calvin to 35,000 calvin
 paramdanav andruni rup se asthai hote hai isliye unki chamak samay ke saath-saath badalati rahati he
 Having such a large mass also reduces their lifespan - where our sun has attained the age of 10 billion years, the supernatural stars live only a few millions of years
 itani kam aayu ke kaaran paramdanav taare bahut kam hi milte hai

 sanyogita / ˈsəmjoʊɡɪtɑː xɔːhɑːnə / ) prithvirajtrutiy kii patni thi
 Ardhangini of Prithviraj was formed by doing Gandharva with Prithviraj
 bharat ke itihaas kii mahatvapurn ghatnaon main sanyogitaaharan gina jaataa he
 The coincidence was the most beautiful of Prithviraj's thirteen rajnis
 sanyogita ko tilottama, kantimati, sanjukta ityadi naamon se bhi janaa jate the
 His father was King Jayachand of Kannauj
 jinhone prithviraj ke viraddh ghori ko yuddh main sahaayta kii thi
 Sanyogita was born in Kannauj region
 uske pita kaa naam jayachand tha
 Prithvirajaraso mentions in the poetry of Samyukritasvayamvara, that Samyukrita was an apsara named Rambha in his previous birth
 kasi rishi ke shaap ke kaaran vah sanyogita ke naam se prithvi par avatarit hui
 Sanyogita is available in a different form in the Vividha poems
 yatha prithvirajraso kavy main sanyogita, prithvirajvijay mahakavy main tilottama or surajncharitamahakavy main kantimati
 In Prithvirajasso's poetry and in the famous epic, it is clearly stated that Sanyogita was the daughter of Jayachand
 prithvirajvijay mahakavy kaa mahan bhaag kshatiyukt he
 But there too, coincidence was born in a village developed on the banks of river Ganges, this mention is attainable
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, wo nagar nishchay hi kannauj tha 
 When Sankatita attained youth, Prithviraj's valor was being discussed all over India
 sanyogita ne jab prithviraj kii veerta kii katha suni, tab vah prithviraj ke prem pash main bandha gai
 In courtship, AC girls have been called Mugdha
 mugdh sanyogita ke hridayastha prem ke vishay main jab jayachand ko sangyaan hua, to usne anya raja ke saath apni putree kaa vivaah karne ke liye udyat hua
 Because the relationship between Jayachand and Prithviraj was illogical
 uske baad jayachand ne ashwamedhyagy kaa aayojan kiya
 At the end of that sacrificial fire, he announced the Swayamvara of Sanyogita
 swayamvar ke avasar par usne sampoorn bharat ke sabhi raajaaon ko nimantran diya parantu prithviraj ko nimantran nahin diya
 Jayachand was not satisfied even after insulting Prithviraj in this way
 atah usne lohe se prithviraj kii murti banavaa kar dwarpal ke sthaan par prasthaapit kar di
 But at the time of swayamvar, Sanketita put the statue of Prithviraj to the garland
 dwaar par sthit sanyogita jab prithviraj kii murti ko varmala pahana rahi thi, usee samay prithviraj ne prasaad main pravesh kiya
 Prithviraj placed Sanyogita on the horse and went to Dehli
 ek baar ajmeru ke mahal ke udyaan main raja prithviraj vihaar kar rahe the, usee samay vahaan pratihaari upasthit hua
 Pratihari said to the king, "O Rajan! a woman from Kanyakubj wants to meet you"
 uske baad raja kaa sanket paa kar pratihaari ne us mahila ko raja ke sammukh prastut kiya
 Greeting the king, the woman said, "O Rajan! The name of the coincidental lady of Jayachand, the lord of Kanyakubja is a girl
 main uske soundarya kaa kya varnan karun ? kaamdev kaa siddhi ke rup main samast padaartha ke saar se brahma ne uski rachana kii he
 The things which were collected by Brahma at the time of creation of Sanyogita, only those things produced amrit, moon, kumud and lotus "
 kinchat ruk kar vah mahila aage boli, "he hindushreshth ! yadi kisi amritsamudr main kaamdev manthan karte, to jo lakshmih hui, un soundaryavati lakshmi se hi kadachit sanyogita ke soundarya kii tulana kar sakate hai"
 Once in the palace with his father, Sanyogita accidentally heard your virtuous song sung by the bards
 jab aap ne mlechhraj ko yuddh main parajeet kiya, tab hi uske hriday main aapke prati anuraag samudbhoot hua
 The golden face like the golden flower of Sanyogita has become the desired lotus flower from your face
 janau kaphoni, karkamal main kapolan, nasika kii ore drushti or aapako man main sthapit kar vah din bitaa rahi hai
 One day, in the third stroke of the night, in a dream, Sanyogita appeared to you as Kamdevarupi
 uskaa virah charamasima ko laangh gaya he
 Hey Rajan! Today the Creator is also raining on him
 sanyogita ke pita uske shatru ban kar sanyogita kaa vivaah anyaraaja ke saath karwaane ke liye udyukt hai
 Hearing the father's wish, weeping princess sadly said to her friend, "ah! Ipsa is foolish to get to the moon by being on the earth
" jis purush ko main nahin jaanati hoon, us purush ke krute pranay ev haasyaaspad he
 It is special that the man is a great emperor
 kanya dwaara kiya gaya vivaah prastaav api vidmbana utpann karata he
 So hey sister! i do not even have the imagination of the seed of hope on my mischievous desire
 ”by saying this, the coincidence fainted
 uske baad prayatnon se jaagarit sanyogita boleen, "tum shakambhari jaao
 Set my heart in front of the emperor
 yadi vah mere uddhaaran ke liye nahin aayenge, tarhi main ganga main dub jaaongi"
 Hearing the request of the hostess, the emperor replied that, "let the wish of that mriganayani be fulfilled
 use kaho ki, main sheeghra hi uski raksha ke liye kanyakubj aauunga"
 After that the hostess deserved hospitality and sent her back
 turant vah swayan bhi apane samanton ke saath kanyakubj kii ore chal padey
 When Prithviraj entered Kanyakubja, he was a pseudo-magician
 kyonki vah kanyakubj kii prayek vithi dekhnaa chaahate the
 Therefore, Prithviraj started touring here and there in the city disguised as Charan
 prithviraj ne kanyakubj nagar ke dwaar, prasaad, vishaal bhawan, chatushpadi or udyaan dekhen
 And while traveling in Kanyakubj city, he gathered information about the city
 surjancharit mahakavy ke anusaar prithviraj ratri main hi sanyogita ko le kar indrapastha chale gayi
 From the mention of coincidence in other texts, a few different references are found in the epics
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki, "jayachand ke shilalekhon main kahin bhi sanyogita kaa ullekh nahin praapt hota he
 And with no evidence of her existence, she is considered a fictional character "
 jo vidvan sanyogita ke aitihaasik paatr hone ke vishay par prashnarthchihn karte hai, unamem dow
 gaurishankar hirachand ojha kii gananaa hoti he
 Dr
 Ojha is of the opinion that nowhere in Jayachand's inscriptions or in the Tamrapatras is there a description of coincidence and no mention of coincidence is found in Rambhamanjarimahakaavya and in Hammirmahakaavya
 atah solahavin shatbdi ke kisi bhaat kii kalpana thi sanyogita kaa paatr he 
 Other historians say that, in Rambhamanjarimahakaavya and in Hammirmahakaavya, there is no description of coincidence Oza-sir said
 parantu un granthon main prithviraj ke vivaahon kaa ullekh hi nahin he
 Can not say that Prithviraj was not married

 The tensile strength or stress confirmation of a substance is the critical point of the stress-deformation curve of that substance and indicates which stress will begin to form after the neck
 iskaa maan pareekshan ke liye lee gayi padaarth ke namoonay ke aakaar par nirbhar nahin karata
 For engineering materials used in structures and mechanical devices, along with elasticity coefficient and corrosion resistance, stress-confirming is of great importance
 mishradhaatuon, compojit padaarthon, siramics, plasticon, kashtha, kankreet aadi ke liye iske maan diye jate hai
 There are three definitions of stress confirmation - paraabhav samarthy jis pratibal par padaarth kii vikruti pratyasth se apratyasth me badalane lagati he jisase padaarth main sthaayee vikruti utpann ho jaati he
 Maximum Strength This is the stress that is the indicator of the maximum stress in the stress-distortion graph

 In physics, energy is a property of objects, which can be transferred to other objects or transformed into different forms
 kisi bhi kaaryakarta ke kaary karne kii kshamta ko urja kehete hai
 There is energy in the water falling from a height because it can rotate a wheel to generate electricity
 urja kii saral paribhaasha dena kathin he
 Energy is not an object
 isko ham dekh nahin sakate, yah koi jagah nahin gherti, na isaki koi chaaya hi padati he
 In short, like other things, it is not a substance, although it is often closely related to matter
 phir bhi iskaa astitv utana hi vaastavik he jitna kisi anya vastu kaa or is kaaran ki kisi pind samudaay main, jiske upar kisi bahari bal kaa prabhaav nahin rahata, isaki maatra main kami beshi nahin hoti
 The ability to work normally is called energy
 jab dhanush se shikaar karanevaala koi shikari dori ko khinchataa he to dhanush main urja aa jaati he jiskaa upyog baan ko shikaar tak chalaane main kiya jaataa he
 The flowing water has energy that can be used for running watermills or for any other work
 isi tarah barood main urja hoti he, jiskaa upyog pathar kii shilaayein todane athwa top se gola daagne main ho saktaa he
 The electric current carries energy from which the electric motor can be driven
 surya ke prakaash main urja hoti he jiskaa upyog prakashaselon dwaara bijli kii dhara utpann karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, nuclear energy is there in the molecule, which is used in destroying the enemy or other work
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki urja kai roopon main pai jaati he
 The energy that is in the stem spring is called potential energy; The energy of flowing water is kinetic energy; The energy of gunpowder is chemical energy; The energy of electric current is electrical energy; The energy of sunlight is called light energy
 surya main jo urja he vah uske unche taap ke kaaran he
 This is called heat energy
 vibhinn upayon dwaara urja ko ek rup se duusare rup main parivartit kiya ja saktaa he
 The amount of energy in these changes is always the same
 usamen kami beshi nahin hoti
 This is called energy-indestructibility principle
 upar kaha gaya he ki kaary kar sakane kii kshamta ko urja kehete hai
 But it is not always possible to convert all the energy into work
 isliye yah kahana adhik upyukt hoga ki urja vah vastu he jo utani hi ghatati he jitna kaary hota he
 For this reason, they are the units of measuring energy
 jo kaary ko naapane ke
 If we lift a kilogram of a meter high, then a certain amount of work has to be done against the gravity of the Earth
 yadi ham isi bhaar ko do meter unchaa uthaayen athwa do kilogram bhaar ko ek meter unchaa uthaayen to donon dashaon main pehle kii apeksha duuna kaary karnaa padegaa
 This shows that the magnitude of the work depends on the magnitude of the force against which the work is done and the magnitude of the distance, the distance by which the force is worked against, and is equal to the product of both these dimensions
 
 kaary kii kisi bhi maatra ko ham kaary kaa ekak maan sakate hai
 For example, the work that one kilogram has to do to lift a meter high against the attraction of the earth can be considered a unit
 parantu prithvi kaa aakarshan sab jagah ek samaan nahin hota
 Its value in Chennai is not in Delhi
 isliye yah ekak asuvidhapurna he
 Yet engineers in many countries use similar units
 jise foot-pound kehete hai
 This is the amount of work that is done on the beach in London's latitude using one pound of another unit dependent on the centimeter-gram-second
 isamen bal ke ekak ko "dine" kehete hai
 Dine is a unit of force that can produce a velocity of one centimeter per second in one gram of a second
 is bal ke kriyabindu ko iske viruddh ek sein
 me
 hataane main jitna kaary karnaa padataa he use varg kehete hai
 But in practical terms this unit of work is very small
 atev dainik vyavhaar main ek doosraa ekak upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 The unit of length is meters instead of centimeters and the unit of mass is kilograms instead of grams
 isamen bal kaa ekak "newton" he
 Newton is a unit of force that can produce a velocity of one meter per second in a second in a kilogram of body
 is tarah newton 1 xxrep 5 0 dine ke baraabar hota he
 The work required to remove the action point of this force up to one meter against it is called Joule
 ek jul 107 argo ke baraabar hota he
 Energy is also measured in these units
 parantu kabhi kabhi vishesh sthalon par kuch anya ekakon kaa upyog hota he
 They have one electron volt
 vah urja kaa vah ekak he jise electron kaa volt ke vibhavantar se guzarane par praapt karata he
 It is a very small unit and is only equal to 1
60 x 10 -19 joules
 iske atirikt gharon main upyog main aanevaali vaidyut urja ko naapane ke liye ek duusare ekak kaa upyog hota he, jise kilowat-ghanta kehete hai or jo 3
6x 10 6 julon ke baraabar hota he l urja ke unit ko jhon perscot jul ke urja ke kshetra me ek kranti laane kii yaad me 'jul' rakhaa
 Instead of those objects, whose existence we can only estimate on the basis of logic, we have a much easier knowledge of those objects which we can see in a broad way
 manushya ke mastishk main urja ke us rup kii bhaavana sabase pratham udai hui jiskaa sambandh bade bade pindon se he or jise yantron kii sahaayta se kaaryrup main parinaat hote ham spashtat: dekh sakate hai
 There are two forms of this mechanical energy: one is potential energy and the other is kinetic energy
 iske vipareet us urja kaa gyaan jiskaa sambandh anuon tathaa parmaanuon kii gati se he, manushya ko baad main hua
 For this reason, it is no less surprising that even before Newton, Francis Bacon believed that heat is due to the motion of particles of matter
 ek kilogram bhaar ke ek pind ko prithvi ke aakarshan ke viruddh ek meter unchaa uthaane main jo kaary karnaa padataa he use ham kilogram-meter kah sakate hai or yah lagbhag 981 julon ke baraabar hota he
 If we take a string and put it on top of a pulley and tie about one kilogram of bodies from both its ends and leave them in such a position that both of them are not at the same height and allow the upper body to come down very slowly, then we We will see that one kilogram will raise the object one meter high
 ghirani main gharshan jitna hi kam hoga doosraa pind bhaar main utana hi pehle pind ke bhaar ke baraabar rakhaa ja sakegaa
 This means that if we raise a body higher than the earth
 ek kilogram bhaar ke pind ko yadi 5 meter unchaa uthaaya jaae to usamen 5 kilogram-meter kaary karne kii kshamta aa jaati he, evam uski urja pehle kii apeksha usee pariman main bad jaati he
 This energy is due to the relative position of the Earth and the body and is actually the energy of the system made by the Earth and the body
 isiilie ise sthitij urja kehete hai
 Whenever there is a difference in the mutual distance of a community of objects or the natural position of different parts of the same body, there is a difference in potential energy
 kamaani ko dabaane se athwa dhanush ko jhukaane se unamem sthitij urja aa jaati he
 If the water is collected at a higher height by damming the rivers, then this water brings potential energy
 newton ne bal kii yah paribhaasha di ki bal samveg ke parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 If a body of m kg is initially stationary and has a constant force F, working for t seconds, the velocity it produces is v m per second, then the value of force is mvt { \ displaystyle { \ frac {mv} {t} }} Will be Newton
 isi samay main pind jo duuri tai kare vah yadi d meter ho to bal dwaara kiya gaya kaary F
d jul ke baraabar hoga
 That is, if the velocity of the mass in m mass is v then its energy will be 1 2 mv 2 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {1} {2}} mv ^ {2}}
 yah urja us pind main uski gati ke kaaran hoti he or gatij urja kehalaati he
 When we release the arrow by tilting the bow, the potential energy of the bow changes to the kinetic energy of the arrow
 sthitij urja evam gatij urja ke parsparik parivartan kaa sabase sundar udhaaharan saral lolak he
 When we pull the pendulum to one side, the ball rises slightly above its normal position and the potential energy comes into it
 jab ham golak ko chhodte hai to golak idhar udhar jhulane lagata he
 When the ball is in the normal position of hanging, it only has kinetic energy
 samveg ke kaaran golak duusari ore chalaa jaataa he or gatij urja pun: sthitij urja main parivartit ho jaati he
 Normally, working against the friction of air reduces the energy of the ball and its motion stops in some time
 yadi gharshan kaa bal na ho to lolak anant kaal tak chalata rahegaa
 Even after the theory of energy-indestructibility in motion science was proven, it was believed that energy can be lost in many situations due to lack of knowledge of its other forms; For example, when there are expected speeds in different parts of a body, potential and kinetic energy decreases due to friction
 vastut: aisi sthitiyon main urja nasht nahin hoti varan ushma urja main parivartan ho jaati he
 But until the 18th century, heat was not considered an independent form of energy
 us samay tak yah dharna thi ki ushma ek dravya he
 It was proved indisputably by experiments in the 19th century that heat is also another form of energy
 yon to pragaitihaasik kaal main bhi manushya lakadiyon ko ragadkar agni utpann karata tha, parantu urja evam ushma ke ghanishtha sambandh kii ore sabase pehle benjamin tamson kaa dhyaan gaya
 It was a resident of the United States of Massachusetts
 parantu us samay yah bavaria ke raja kaa yudhmantri tha
 While piercing the molded brass cannon tubes, he noticed that the tube becomes very hot and the fillets from it become even more heated
 ek prayog main top kii naal ke chaaron ore kaath kii naand main pani bharkar usne dekha ki kharadane se jo ushma utpann hoti he usase dhai ghante main sara pani ubalane ke taap tak pahunch gaya
 In this experiment, his real goal was to prove that heat is not a liquid that is in the bodies and due to pressure comes out like water from the cloth by squeezing; Because if this were the case, there would be only a limited amount of fluid in a body, but it is known by the use of perforator that the more work done, the more heat will be generated
 rumuard ne yah prayog san 1798 i
 main kiya
 20 years before this, Lavaggee and lagrange saw that animals produce as much heat from food as can be obtained from food by chemical reactions
 san 1819 main francisi vaigyanik dulon ne dekha ki kisi gas ke sampeden se usamen ushma usee anupaat main utpann hoti he jitna sampeden main kaary kiya jaataa he
 In 1842 AD, the same sentiment was used by Julius Robert Maier, who was then only 28 years old and a doctor in the city of Highbronn, Germany, to calculate how much work is necessary to produce a heat of heat
 
 ham jaanate hai ki prayek gas kii do vishisht ushmayen hoti he : ek niyat aaytan par tathaa duusari niyat daab par
 In the first stage, the gas does not work
 duusari avasthaa main gas ko bahya dabaav ke viruddh kaary karnaa padataa he or donon vishisht ushmaaon main jo antar hota he vah isi kaary ke samatuly hota he
 In this way, the value of mechanical equivalent of heat that Maier received was almost the same as that of Count Rumford
 isi samay england main james presskaat jul bhi ushma kaa yantric tulyank nikaalane main laga hua tha
 Its use continued from 1842 AD to 1852 AD
 apane prayog main isane ek taanbe ke ushmamapi main pani liya or use ek mathni se matha
 The churn was run on two loads hanging from two pulleys
 jis door se ye bhaar latake hue the vah is mathni ke sire main lapeti hui thi or jab ye bhaar neeche kii ore girte the to mathni gumti thi
 When these loads fell, their potential energy was reduced
 is kami kaa kuch bhaag bhaaron kii gatij urja main parinat hota tha or kuch bhaag mathni ko ghumaane main vyay hota tha
 In this way it could be known how much work was being done to rotate the churn
 ushmamapi ke pani ke taap main jitani vruddhi hui usase yah gyaat ho saktaa tha ki kitni ushma utpann hui; or tab ushma kaa yantric tulyank gyaat kiya ja saktaa tha
 Joule did these experiments with both water and mercury
 san 1847 i
 main harmaan phan helmholts ne ek pustak likhi jisamen ushma, chumbak, bijli, bhautik rasayan aadi vibhinn kshetron ke udaahranon dwaara ushma-avinashita-siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya tha
 Joule proved the similarity of electrical energy and heat energy by experiment
 dekhen - vidyut urja In 1905, Einstein proposed his relative theory according to which the mass of particles depends on their kinetic energy
 iskaa yah arth he ki urja kaa maan dravyaman vruddhi ko prakaash ke veg ke varg se guna karne par praapt hota he
 This theory is confirmed by many experiments in nuclear science
 surya main bhi urja isi tarah banati he
 There is a chain reaction in the Sun, which results from the combination of four nuclei of hydrogen to form the nucleus of helium
 hydrogen ke chaaron nabhikon ke dravyaman kaa yogafal helium ke nabhik se kuch adhik hota he
 This difference is converted into energy
 parmaanu bam evam hydrogen bam main bhi isi dravyaman-urja-samatulyata kaa upyog hota he
 Studying what is the exact formula for the distribution of the radiation of the Krishna body according to the different alphabets of the spectrum, Plank came to the conclusion that the exchange of radiation does not happen in irregular amounts by small particles of direct energy
 in kanon ko rahata he
 Multiplying the frequency number by which the value of the energyquantum is obtained is called the Planck constant
 niles bor ne san 1913 i
 main yah dikhalaayaa ki yah kwantum siddhant atyant vyapak he or parmaanuon main electron jin kakshaon main ghoomte hai
 Those orbits are also fixed according to quantum theory
 jab electron adhik urjawali kaksha se kam urjawali kaksha main jaataa he to in do urjaaon kaa antar prakaash ke rup main baahar aata he
 Heisenberg, Schrödinger and Dirac have expanded this quantum theory even further
 aadhunik bhautik vigyaan main prayek kaary ke liye urja ko aavashyak bataaya gaya he
 According to the energy conservation principle, energy can neither be generated nor destroyed, only its form can be changed
 ham apane dainik jivan main prayog karne hetu urja ke istemaal kai roopon main karte hai, yatha - yantric urja, vidyut urja, ooshmiya urja, prakaash urja, rasaynic urja ityadi
 The electrical energy in the motor is converted into mechanical energy and the chemical energy in the battery into electrical energy
 maanav sharir khaadya padaarthon kii rasinic urja ko pachaa kar usase yantric kaary karata he
 Similarly, an electric bulb converts electrical energy into light and thermal energy
 car yaa bas kaa eenjan petrol kii rasinic urja ko pehle ooshmiya urja main badalata he tathaa use phir yantric urja main
 The energy used for all these functions comes from these sources - urja kii avadharana unnisvin shatabdi main aayi
 It is a very important and fundamental concept invented by humans
