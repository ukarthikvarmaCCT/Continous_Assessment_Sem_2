 The basic scripture of acting is considered to be Natyashastra
 iske rachayita bharatmuni the
 When taught by the dramatist or according to the speech or action referred to in the metaphor composed by the dramatist based on the famous or fable, the audience, through its speech, physical gestures, gestures, mukhamudra dress, the words, the knowledge of the expressions of the words and When you feel the juice, then that whole integrated business is called acting
 bharat ne natyakaron main abhinay shabd kii nirukti karte hue kaha he: "abhinay shabd 'neen' dhaatu main 'abhi' upsarg lagaakar bana he
 The purpose of acting is to convey the meaning of a verse or word to its main meaning; That is, to overwhelm the audience or social with emotion or meaning "
 kaviraj vishwanath ne sahitya darpan ke chathe pariched ke armbh main kaha he: 'bhavedbhinyoreshvasthanukar:' arthath avasthaa kaa anukaran hi abhinay kehalaata he
 From childhood, the tendency to act is in humans and many other creatures
 haath, pair, aankh, munh, sir chalaakar apane bhav prakat karne kii pravriti sabhy or asabhy jatiyon main samaan rup se pai jaati he
 One of the aims of their imitation acts is that they enjoy the real experience and secondly, it helps them to express their feelings to others
 isi duusare uddeshy ke kaaran shaareerik yaa angik cheshtaaon or mukhmudraon kaa vikaas hua jo junglee jatiyon main boli hui bhashaa ke badale yaa uski sahaayak hokar abhinay prayog main aati he
 Bharata has considered four types of acting - Aangik, Vachik, Dietary and Satvik
 angik abhinay kaa arth he sharir, mukh or cheshtaaon se koi bhav yaa arth prakat karnaa
 Acting performed by the head, hand, lumbar, thoracic, lateral and phage is called acting or contingent acting, and vocal acting done by eye, eyebrow, hem, cheekbones and chin is called appendage acting
 cheshtaakrit abhinay use kehete hai jisamen puure sharir kii vishesh cheshtaa ke dwaara abhinay kiya jaataa he jaise langade, kubade, yaa buudhe kii cheshtaayen dikhaakar abhinay karnaa
 All these types of acting are done according to the particular rasa, bhava and communicative gesture
 sharir athwa angik abhinay main sir ke tarah, drushti ke chhattis, aankh ke taron ke nau, put ke nau, bhunhon ke saat, naak ke chah, kapol ke chah, adhar ke chah or thodhi ke aath abhinay hote hai
 There are six types of acting widely used in Mukhtha Chesthas
 bharat ne kaha he ki mukhraag se yukt shaareerik abhinay thodaa bhi ho to usase abhinay kii shobhaa dooni ho jaati he
 There are four types of this face - natural, happy, blood and black
 greeva kaa abhinay bhi vibhinn bhaavon ke anusaar nau prakaar kaa hota he
 There are thirteen types of combined hand acting, twenty four types of unconnected hand acting, sixty four types of nrithi hand acting and four types of hand acting reasons
 iske atirikt vaksh ke paanch, parshv ke paanch, udar ke teen, kati ke paanch, uru ke paanch, jangha ke paanch or pair ke paanch prakaar ke abhinay bataae gaye hai
 Bharat has described in detail the acting of the motion, describing the sixteen bhumacharis and sixteen Akashichars, the acting of the ten sky and that of the bhoom mandal
 , How the person with ashram, varna and occupation should walk in the theater and at what speed should he perform the chariot, plane, ascension, descent, sky flight etc
 gati ke hi samaan asana yaa baithne kii vidhi bhi bharat ne vistaar se samajhaaii he
 Just as the Ghanists in Europe have enacted exercises for acting skills, so has Bharata given such a detailed account of acting that no country in the world has demonstrated the same art of acting in relation to acting
 satvik abhinay to un bhaavon kaa vaastavik or hardik abhinay he jinhen ras siddhanthavale satvik bhav kehete hai or jiske antargat, swead, stambh, camp, ashru, vaivarny, romaanch, swarbhang or pralay kii gananaa hoti he
 Of these, except Sveda and Thrill, the rest can be acted as sattvic
 ashru ke liye to vishesh sadhana aavashyak he, kyonki bhav magn hone par hi uski siddhi ho sakati he
 Everything that an actor says on the stage is called sub-speech
 sahitya main to ham log vyakruta vaani hi grahan karte hai, kintu naatak main avyaakruta vaani kaa bhi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Spitting of all kinds of sounds like sparrows bidding, whistling or cheering the dhos, etc
 is a part of oral acting
 bharat ne vaachik abhinay ke liye 63 lakshanon kaa or unke dosha-gun kaa bhi vivechan kiya he
 The greatest quality of speech acting is to maintain the ascension of your speech in such a way that the said word or sentence maintains its expression and effect
 vaachik abhinay kii sabase badi visheshta yahi he ki yadi koi jawanika ke peeche se bhi bolta ho to keval uski vaani sunakar hi uski mukhmudra, bhavabhangima or aakanksha kaa gyaan kiya ja sake
 Dietary acting is not really a part of acting but a part of the naphthayakarma and its relation is not as much to the actor as the one doing the naphthayaja
 kintu aaj ke sabhi pramukh abhinayta or natyaprayokta yah maanane lage hai ki prayek abhinayta ko apni mukhasajja or rupasajja swayan kerani chahie
 The most bizarre episode in the Natyashastra of Bharata is that of Chitrabhinaya, in which he has described the performance of Ritu, Bhavas, many kinds of creatures, gods, mountains, river, ocean etc
, many stages and morning, evening, Chandjyotsna etc
 yah samoochaa abhinayavidhan pratikatmak hi he, kintu ye pratik us prakaar ke nahin hai jis prakaar ke europea pratikabhinyavaadiyon ne grahan kiye hai
 The dance that began with the worship of the gods in Greece was the first form of Abhinayakala in which the expression of the narrative was expressed through dance

 Because of the use of masks, there was a lot of improvement in speech acting, but the way of acting with mouthpieces could not flourish
 italysiyon main abhinay kii ruchi badi swaabhaavik he
 Long before the play was written, there has been a general tendency that any party was given a subject that they would immediately present their performance
 sangeet, nrity or drishy ke is prem ne vahaan ke raajnneetik or dharmik sangharsh main bhi abhinayakala ko jivit rakhane main badi sahaayta di he
 Shakespeare gave the most importance to acting arts in Europe
 usne swayan maanav swabhaav ke sabhi charitron kaa chithran kiya he
 He has included in Hamlet's dialogue, incorporating the core elements of superior acting, that speech should use speech and body parts naturally, not exaggeratedly
 18veen shatabdi main hi europe main abhinay ke sambandh main vibhinn siddhanton or pranaaliyon kaa pradurbhaav hua
 The French encyclopaedia Deni Didero propounded the theory of real-life drama, bored with the sublime French drama and its conservative acting method, and suggested that the play should become the real antithesis of the bourgeois life of France
 usne abhinayta ko yah sujhaayaa ki prayog ke samay apane par dhyaan dena chahie, apni vaani sunani chahie or apane aavegon kii smritiyaan hi prastut kerani chahie
 However, Theodor Komisarjevsky, a former user and artist of 'moscow Stage and Imperial Theater' wrote, refuting this principle: 20veen shatabdi main anek natyavidyalayon, natyasansthaaon or rangashaalaon ne abhinay ke sambandh main anek nae or spasht siddhant pratipaadit kiye
 Marx Reinhart practiced in Germany and Fermi Gémie in Paris, a naturalistic theatrical practice that was presented by Ande Antwant in France and Kronig in Germany, developed by Ottobrahm in Berlin and Stanislavski in Moscow
 in prayoktaaon ne bich-bich main prakrutivaadee abhinay main yaa to ritivaadee logon ke vichaaron kaa sannivesh kiya yaa san 1910 ke pashchaat chromisargevsky ne abhinay ke sanshleshnatmak siddhanton kaa jo pravarttan kiya tha unka bhi thodaa bahut samavesh kiya; kintu adhikansh francisi abhinayta 18veen shatabdi kii pracheen romansavaadi paddati kaa ardhodatt abhinayapaddati kaa hi prayog karte rahe
 One of the most famous theories of acting after 1910 is the system of Stanislavsky, the most famous Mask Art Theater user, whose principle is that any actor can be natural and true on the theater only when he performs the impulses he experienced in his life Ho
 abhinay main yah aantarik prakrutwad stanisalavski kii koi nai suujhi nahin thi kyonki kuch francisi natyagyon ne 18veen shatabdi main inhen vichaaron ke aadhaar par apni abhinay paddatiyaan pravartit kii thim
 According to Stanislavsky, those actors can perform the scene of love well, who are in love in real life
 stansilavski ke siddhant ke viruddh pratikwaadiyon, ritivaadiyon or abhivyanjanavadiyon ne nai reeti chalaai jisamen satyata or jeevanatulyata kaa purna bahishkaar karke kaha gaya ki abhinay jitna hi kam, vaastavik or kam jeevanatulya hoga utana hi acha hoga
 The actor should try to create a certain character
 use gudh vichaaron kaa rudh reeti se apni vaani, apni cheshtaa or mudraon dwaara prastut karnaa chahie or vah abhinay rudh, jivan-samya-hin, chitramay or kathputli--nrity--style main prastut karnaa chahie
 The conservatives later went on to use so much joviality, rhetoric, and rhythm in acting under the leadership of Meyerhold, Tyroff, and Arvin Piscator that their acting on the theater seemed as if a circus was taking place in which the jumpy, artistic body Balance and similar motions should prevail
 yah abhinay hi ghanvaadee abhinay kahalaane laga
 Among these rhythms, Meyerhold later became a naturalist, but expressionist such as Leopold Jessavar, Nicholas Evarenov, or rather exaggerated actuarians, followed some of the systems of conservatives and some of the psychological naturalist method
 is prakaar abhinay kii drushti se europe main paanch prakaar kii abhinay paddatiyaan chalin : From the fourth decade of the 20th century, ie around the Second World War, Europe's acting system changed and often in every European and American theater, every actor was expected to show a novelty and originality in his acting in a very unexpected manner
 Make people satisfied by acting
 aajkal abhinayta ke liye yah aavashyak mana jane laga he ki vah apni kalpana kaa prayog karke naatak ke bhav kii prayek paristhiti main apane abhinay kaa aisa sanshlisht sangyojan kare ki usase naatak main kuch vishesh chetana or sajivta utpann ho
 It is his religion to keep the flow and influence of the play proper and clearly preserve the playwright's spirit with the strength of his talent, keeping in mind the practical approach of the theater
 aajkal ke prasiddh abhinaytaon kaa kathan he ki abhinayta ko kisi vishesh paddati kaa anusaran nahin karnaa chahie or na kisi abhinayta kaa anusaran karnaa chahie
 In fact, there is no single theory of acting, which can be said to be the same for two plays or for two actors in any one situation
 aajkal ke abhinayta sanchaalak isi mat ke hai ki achche abhinayta ko sansar ke sab naatakon kii sab bhoomikaaon ke liye koi nishchit pranali dhund nikaalani chahie or tadnusaar apane ko swayan shikshit karte chalanaa chahie
 Most of today's theaters believe that in order to make a play effective, the actor should neither be too naturalistic nor too expressive or rhythmic
 atiranjit abhinay to kabhi karnaa hi nahin chahie
 Today's acting system is characterized by a characteristic manner in which an actor, by virtue of a particular type of character, assumes the same role in all the plays
 chalchitron ke kaaran is prakaar ke charitra abhinayta bahut badhate ja rahe hai
 The accepted role in the role is to act in six types of motions according to nature, rasa and bhava --- the stunned motion in the utmost compassion, the dull motion in calm, the ordinary pace in adornment, the hasa and the bebhats, the speed in the heroic, the gallant Exuberant speed and extreme speed in fear
 in sabakaa vidhaan vibhinn bhaavon, vyaktiyon, avasthaaon or paristhitiyein par avlambit hota he
 The field of acting is very wide
 sankshep main yahi kaha jaae saktaa he ki abhinayta ko moulik hona chahie or kisi paddati kaa anusaran na karke yah praytn karnaa chahie ki apni rachana ke dwaara naatakkaar jo prabhaav darshakon par daalana chahta he uskaa uchit vibhaajan ho sake
 How can any actor understand the character assigned to him? Every actor adopts their own method to play the given character on the stage
 lekin vah karne se pehle abhinayta ko lipi ko bahut hi gaur se samaj lenaa chaiye, duusare paatro ki panktiyaan ki jaanch bhi kar leni chahie lipi padhane ke baad jo bhi khyaal kahani or paatr ke bare main aate hai use lipi main hi likh lenaa chahie duusare paatro ke dwaara apane paatr ke bare me bohot si jaankaree bhi mil sakati he
 Many of the characteristics of your character can only be miles from the lines if the script is carefully read, features like how the character looks - if it looks good or bad, its behavior, behavior, voice and other things if you are a living person Or if you want to play the character of a woman, then try to observe them carefully, observe them, see their bark, see the way of talking to them, also to the character of the post about their era
 Do as much research as possible to keep up well
 abhinayta ko apane nideshak se zarur baat kerani chaiye taaki nideshak ke dimaag me jo paatr kaa vichaar he uskaa upyog kar sake kuch nirdeshak paatr ke bare me bohot jaankaree de kar kaam aasaan kar dete he, or kuch nideshak kuch nahi kehete, is kaaran abhinayta ko nideshak ke saat paatr ke upar bahes nahi kerani chaiye or apni kalpana kaa pura phayda uthaanaa chahie ho sake to abhyaas karte samy paatr ke kapadey pahane kar kare kyonki usase paatr ko mahasoos karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 In his spare time, the actor should repeat his lines, in that way sometimes something new about his character is revealed
 agar koi bhaavana he jo dikhaane me mushkil ho rahi ho tab dimag me kalpana kii madd se koi sthiti bana ke us bhaavana ko us sthiti se jod kar uskapryog kare

 After much thought, he felt that the General Secretary would be best for this task
 unhone mahaamantri ko bulaakar unase vimarsh karnaa shuru kiya
 Then a servant of the General Minister's house came and stood there
 mahaamantri ne use dekha to samaj gaye ki avashya koi bahut hi gambhir baat he anyathaa vah naukar uske paas nahin aata
 He apologizes to the king and asks the servant something different
 jab naukar ne kuch bataaya to unka cheharaa utar gaya or ve raja se vidaa lekar vahaan se chale gaye
 The king felt that the general minister had some trouble after the general minister suddenly left unhappy and worried
 unhone naukar se unke is tarah jane kaa kaaran poocha to naukar hichkichaya
 When the king gave the order, he folded his arm and said that the General Secretary had told me not to tell you the truth
 unhone kaha tha ki sachai jaanane ke baad raja kaa dhyaan bant jayega or jo yajna hone vaala he usamen vyavdhaan hoga
 The king said that the General Secretary is his very loyal servant and he also has a duty to redress his suffering

 naharon or anya jalmargon main vishesh antar yah hota he ki anya jalmaarg, jaise nadi, naale or sagar prakritik hone ke kaaran swayan hi us dasha main bane rahete hai, kintu naharon ko thik dasha main rakhane ke liye sadaa upachaar karne padate hai
 For example, to keep the Suez Canal traffic-able, to extract sand from it, large machines are constantly employed and a large number of engineers have to be taken care of
 iske atirikt naharon main yatayaat ke liye bahudhaa "lock" banaae jate hai
 These "locks" make it possible to travel between high surfaces
 sagaron ke madhya hi nahin, bahut si nadiyon or jhiilon ko bhi naharon dwaara yatayaat ke liye jod diya jaataa he
 Such locks are located between Dal Lake and Jhelum River in Kashmir
 sansar ke kai shahar aise hai jahaan naharon dwaara hi shahar ke andar yatayaat ho saktaa he, jaise italy kaa vishwavikhyath venice nagar
 Many canals in Holland are built for traffic in cities like Amsterdam
 bharat main bhi shaharon ke madhya yatayaat ke liye badi naharen banaai gai hai jaise dakshin bharat main buckingham canal
 There are many small traffic canals in various parts of the country
 naharon kaa doosraa uddeshy he nadi yaa sarovaron se jalapradaay yaa bhusinchan ke nimitt jal ko dur-dur tak pahunchaana
 a lot of work in this direction has been done in India in the 19th century
 vaise, pracheen kaal kii bani hui bahut si naharen desh ke bhinn-bhinn bhaagon main dekhi jaati hai
 But special work has been done in Bhusinchan region itself, because India is an agricultural country
 bhusinchan ke liye bahut badi-badi naharen banaai gai thim
 Many centuries ago, canals were drawn in South India by creating an anicut on the Kaveri River
 aadhunik yug main ganga nadi se, punjab main sutluj or vyas nadi se badi-badi naharon kaa nirmaan hua jinke dwaara lakhon acre bhoomi ko sinchai kaa laabh hua
 In the Doab of Ganga Yamuna, about 32 lakh acres of land is irrigated every year by mixing the upper and lower Ganga Canal
 ise liye ganga yamuna ke doaab kshetron main lagbhag 8,000 mile choti badi naharon kaa jaal sa failaa hua he, jo vibhinn nadiyon or naalon ke bich ke kshetra ko sinchit karti hai
 It is the largest land-keeping system in India
 iske atirikt ganga nahar par sthit jalprapaaton se panbizli kaa utpaadan bhi hota he
 Therefore, the canals bring about multi-faceted development and along with the growth of agriculture in the irrigated area, they also progress in the industry and help in raising the standard of living of the people
 prashasan ko bhi acchhee naharon se rajasav kosh main aamadani ho jaati he, jaise upree or nichali ganga naharon se uttar pradesh prashasan ko san 1958-59 main lagbhag 1
6 karod rupye kaa, sab kharchaa aadi katkar, munafa rahaa
 Canals are man-made water flow systems that are of two types: 1
 Aqueduct : jo krishi yaa maanav upyog ke liye istemaal hoti hai
 Fresh water is also flowed as needed
 2
 Waterway canals : ye naharen yatayaat main kaam aati hai
 Ships and boats carry passengers or goods through the use of these canals
 ye naharen maujuuda jhiilon, nadiyon or samandaron ko joda karti hai
 Like the famous Suez and Panama canals
 The word canal is originally a Persian word
 netherlands ke shaharon main shahar kii naharen gracht bhi kehalaati hai
 The special thing in the construction of irrigation canals is that these canals are taken through such paths, where water may flow to both sides of the canals for irrigation
 at: nahar kaa bahaav sinchit kshetra ke antargat unchi se unchi bhoomi par hokar niojit kiya jaataa he
 The river and drainage, in contrast, flow from the bottom to the bottom of the area
 vastav main naharen bahudhaa do nadiyon yaa naalon ke madhya ucch bhoomi par hokar hi nikalati he
 Somewhere the canals have to cross many rivers and streams to reach this high ground
 udhaaharan ke liye, upree ganga nahar ko apane udgam sthaan haridwar or rudki ke bich lagbhag 20 mile ke faasale main chaar pahari nadiyon ko paar karnaa padataa he or vah bhi bhinn-bhinn rup se
 In fact the paved road runs along the Upper Ganges Canal from Roorkee to Haridwar and these 20 miles provide an opportunity to see some important engineering works
 do sthanon par nahar pahari nadiyon ko neeche se paar karti he ek jagah nadi nahar main mila lee jaati he or ek anya jagah, solani aquidct par, nahar nadi ke upar hokar guzarati he
 Solani Aqueduct is world famous
 yah mahatvapurn kaary, sirf eenton or chooney se, lagbhag 1850 i
 main puraa hua tha
 As the irrigation canal progresses, it becomes smaller like branches of trees
 iske vipareet nadiyaan jaise-jaise aage badhati hai, badi hoti jaati hai or unki sahaayak nadiyaan tathaa naale unamem milte rahete hai
 Branches originate from distribution canals or roads and small canals, called minor or bumblebees, emerge from them
 in sab naharon se kulabe, moudhe yaa out let dwaara pani kheton ke liye nikaala jaataa he
 All this distribution is compatible with scientifically determined principles
 yadi aisa na kiya jaae to naharon main, jo saikadon mile tak pani pahunchaati hai, pani hi na pahunche
 For this, government departments are established in which skilled engineers are appointed to keep the canals in good condition and to run prescribed amount of water in them
 naharon main pani bhi aisi gati se chalaaya jaataa he ki usase nahar main na to kataav ho or na talachat hi jamaa ho
 Wherever required, the falls are made so that the slope of the bottom of the canal can be kept in the prescribed condition
 is disha main bahut gaveshna kaary bharat main hua he or hota rahata he
 Many other problems arise in the operation of canals, the responsibility of the engineers remains to be solved
 naharon main aavashyaktaa ke anusaar nikaas bhi banaae jate hai, jinke dwaara aavashyaktaa na rahane par yaa kisi tut-foot ke samay, atirikt pani sameepvarti nadi yaa naalon main nikaala ja sake
 It is often said that the canal is running full and there was heavy rainfall in that area, which led to zero demand for betel water
 aisi avasthaa main moghe yaa kulabe band kar dene padate hai
 But the entire water cannot be fed by a canal, so it becomes mandatory to drain the water into the river or drains
 jahaan nahar adhik bharaav main hokar banaai jaati he vahaan nahar ke donon kinaaron ke pushte badi saavdhaanee se banaae jate hai
 For example, the Upper Ganges canal passes through Roorkee in a heavy fill on either side of the Solani aqueduct
 vahaan bharaav 35 foot tak kaa he, arthath donon ore kii bhoomi kaaphi nichi he
 There are pucca flowers, which are about three miles in length
 kintu phir bhi pani kaa risaav tali main se hota he jisko sametane ke liye donon ore naaliyaan bani hui hai, jinamein rison kaa pani jamaa hokar nadi main chalaa jaataa he
 There is also a lot of loss due to leakage from canals somewhere
 naharon ke banane se saamaanya bhugarbha jalatal unchaa ho jaataa he
 If the capacity of water leaks in the surrounding land is reduced, then there is a state of waterlogging and the cultivable land starts to become agricultural
 at: naharon ke nirmaan ke saath-saath nikasi naalon kaa nirmaan aavashyak ho jaataa he
 If these measures are not taken in time, there is a possibility of huge loss, as has happened in some areas of Punjab
 naharon ke saath-saath naalon kaa nirmaan anivaary he
 In many areas of the world, due to lack of proper drainage of water, canals have resulted in loss rather than profit
 kahin kahin rison rokane ke liye naharon kii tali or donon tateey parshvon kaa concrit yaa chunaai se athwa anya sadhano se pakkaa kar dete hai
 It reduces water leakage
 yah niti visheshkar usee kshetra main safal hoti he jahaan sinchai nahin hoti or nahar keval pani ko aage le jane ke liye bani hoti he
 However, where irrigation is done, this means does not prevent waterlogging for a long time, it is imperative to work carefully with careful landings and drainage drains or additional drainage tips below the ground

 Demography refers to the study of human populations based on size, density, location, age, sex, race, and occupation
 yah vipanakon ke adhyayan karne ke liye ek bahut hi mahatvapurn kaarak he or yah aabaadi ko bazaar khandon or lakshith bazaar main vibhajit karne main sahaayta karata he
 An example of demographics is to categorize groups of people according to year of birth
 These classifications are referred to as Baby Boomer, who was born between 1946 and 1964, Generation X, who was born 1965 and 1976, Generation Y, who was born between 1977 and 1994

 Before them, there was a complete lack of this subject in Hindi
 gulabry ji kii saahitiyik rachanaaon ke antargat unke aalochanatmak niabandh aate hai
 These critical essays are both theoretical and practical
 gulabry ji ne saamaajik, saanskrithik, manovaigyanik aadi vividh vishyon par bhi apni lekhnee chalaakar hindi sahitya kii abhivruddhi kii he
 Gulabrai ji's language is a pure and sophisticated standing dialect

 In short, Gulab Rai Ji's language is moderate, serious and fluent
 gulab raay ji kii rachanaaon main hamen nimnlikhit shaileyon ke darshan hote hai- 1
 Critical style - This style is found in Gulab Rai Ji's critical and reflective essays
 is style main saahitiyik tathaa darshanik vishyon par gambhirtha se vichaar karte samay vaakya apekshaakrit lambey or duruh ho jate hai, kintu jahaan vartmaan samasyaayen, pracheen siddhanton kii vyakhyaayein athwa kaviyon kii vyaakhyaatmak aalochanaayen prastut kii gai hai, vahaan vaakya saral or bhavpurn hai
 An example of this style - celebrating 'rashtriya Parva' is not a sentimental sentiment
 is bhavukta kaa mulya he
 Sentimentality involves infectiousness and then infuses power
 vichaar hamaari dasha kaa nidarshan kar sakate hai kintu kaary sampadan kii prabal prerana or shakti bhaavon main hi nihit rahati he
 2
 Emotional style - This style of Gulab Rai ji has a beautiful fusion of thoughts and feelings
 yah style prabhaavshaaleen he or isamen gadhy kavy kaa sa anand aata he
 Its language is very simple
 vaakya chote-chote hai or kahin-kahin urdu ke prachlit shabdon kaa bhi prayog hua he
 An example of this style from an essay titled ‘nar to Narayana’ - ‘there was an outbreak of water in Agra in the month of September
 maine bhi vaisya dharm ke paalane ke liye paas ke ek khet main chari 'bo' rakhi thi
 The leaves of jowar were twisted into lumps
 3
 hasya or vinodpurn style - gulab raay ji ne apane nibandhon kii neerasata ko dur karne ke liye gambhir vishyon ke varnan main hasya or vyangy kaa put bhi diya he
 In this subject, he has written- 'now i have started incorporating humor in serious subjects too
 jahaan hasya ke kaaran arth kaa anarth hone kii sambhaavna ho athwa atyant karun prasang ho to hasya se bachuungaa anyathaa main prasang gat hasya kaa utana hi swaagat karata hoon jitna ki kripan yaa koi bhi anayas aae hue dhan kaa
 In order to incorporate humor in this style, Gubab Rai ji either resorts to idioms or puns
 is style ke vaakya kuch bade hai
 Urdu, Persian words and idioms have also been used in it
 gulabry ji ne moulik granthon kii rachana ke saath-saath anek granthon kaa sampadan bhi kiya he

 iskaa arth yah hua ki salanaa rajasav vasuuli se us gaanv kaa hissaa sarkari khajaane main nahin jayega athwa use aanshik chhot milegi
 During the Mughal era, people were given to influential people or people of general category as a reward in the village estate
 magar usee naam ke anya gaanvon se fark karne ke liye nae bane jagirdaar uske aage jaagir jod dete the jaise hinautiyaor hinautiya jaagir

 pakistan ke pradhan mantri Romanagari is a mixed word of Roman and Devanagari
 yah shabd hindi chitthakaron dwaara pratipaadit kiya gaya tha
 This is a popular abuse in the blog world
 romanagari kaa aashay he hindi ko roman lipi main likhnaa
 for example : mera desh bharat hai
 hum sab bharatvashi hain, hindi hamari rashtrabhasha hai, hamen hindi bahut pasand hai
 Romaniagari on the Internet is generally written by those who are not familiar with or do not know enough about Unicode Hindi typing tools
 kai baar aise tul aasaani se uplabdh na hone par bhi romanagari kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Another reason for its use is the lack of Unicode support for some applications and Internet services, due to which it becomes compulsory to write in Roman Hindi itself
 iske alaava esemes tathaa chating main bhi iskaa prayog bahutayat se hota he
 Writing in Romnagari has some disadvantages, the first being that the reader has a lot of difficulty in reading it
 aksharon ko jod-jod kar matlab samajhnaa padataa he jisamen bahut samay lagata he
 All the emphasis is on understanding the written, so that it does not focus on the subject
 haan chat main yah chal saktaa he kyonki tab ek baar main ekaadh line likhi jaati he jise padhane main utana samay nahin lagata
 Secondly, it is a distorted form of Hindi, how much to be tried, Hindi cannot be written correctly in Roman
 iske atirikt is rup main likhane se hindi kii sundarataa nasht ho jaati he
 It is also not profitable from search point of view, because pages written in Romnagari will neither appear in English search nor in Hindi search
 chitthajagat main bahut se logon kaa mat he ki yaa to hindi devanagari main likhi jaae anyathaa roman main likhane se behatar he ki angreji bhashaa main hi likhaa jaae kyonki vah padhane main bhi aasaan hoti he or sundar bhi dikhti he
 Apart from this, there is another reason not to write in Romanagari
 ab aise phonetic typing tul uplabdh hai jinase roman vaali hi kunjiyon kaa prayog karte hue unicode hindi main likhaa ja saktaa he
 That is, there is no need to learn typing to write in Hindi, just use the appropriate tool and write using the same spelling as Roman, it will be printed in Hindi itself
 vartmaan main adhikansh aadhunik oparating systams hindi unicode fonts ke saath aate hai par phir bhi agar preloded naa hon to hindi unicode fonts install kiye ja sakate hai iske atirikt aise anek tuls hai jo roman lipi ko sidhe hi hindi main badal dete he arthath aap roman main tip karenge hello to vah hello main likh jaayegaa
 For this purpose Google has created its own input tools in many languages like Hindi input tools for Hindi
 iske atirikt devanagari se romanagari parivartan hetu i-pandit conwarter naamak aujaar bhi he

 One is the arrival of food grains in everyone's house and changes in the weather
 After the monsoon season is over, Dussehra, Diwali and Chhath make people happy with a little relief from the humidity
 makar sankranti ke din log log nae dhan se bane chuda or dahi evam good kaa aswadan karte hai
 The village has grown a lot over time
 sadak achche hue hai
 The village has telephone and internet services and public transport facilities are available 24 hours a day
 gaanv me swagiry ramesh jha ke prayaason se unke samay me pani kii line bhi bichaai gayi thi
 But due to the proximity of Kosi, the water level is very close to the ground level and because of this people use Chapakal water only because they are more fresh
 gaanv me kai praathmik or madhya vidhyalay hai
 There is a separate high school for boys and girls, whose list is given below
 gaanv kii vishalata ke kaaran har roj kai jagahon par puja, jap, tap kirthan bhajan chalata rahata he
 Therefore, the atmosphere here remains like Kashi, where chanting and worshiping is going on all the time
 bhajan kirthan shaam ke kaaryakramon kaa hissaa hote he or kai yuva isamen shariq hote hai
 Maithil Brahmin is the majority of the village
 haalaanki anya jati ke log bhi is gaanv main rahete hai
 Most of the Maithil Brahmins are of Kujilwar origin
 is mul ke logo kaa upnaam khan he
 Khan surname is found in such Muslim religions
 hindi dharmavblambiyon ke bich khan upnaam shaayad desh bhar ke liye anuthi baat he
 There are many opinions about how the Khan surname came about
 kuch log maanate hai ki ki mogul sultanate ke shaskao ke kusilvaaron ke kar vasuuli ke kaushal se prabhavit hokar unhen khan upnaam se nawaaza
duusari dharna ye he ki ek baar kisi angrej ne gaanv kii kisi yuvati ke saundarya se prabhavit hokar jarbadasti shaadi karne kii yojana banaai
 But when the girl's family heard this, her blood boiled
 atah unhone us angrej ko chhadam se maarane kii yojana banaai
 He said that marriage should be done in the traditional way
 baraat ke saath us angrej ko phoos se ghire pandal main jala ke maar daalaa gaya
 When the people of English government started looking for the villagers, they started telling their surname Khan to cheat them
 Nobody knows what is true because there is no written evidence available
 gauratlab he ki 16veen sahatabdi me akbar ne darbhanga raaj ko uttari bihar ke kar vasuuli kaa jimmaa diya tha
 Before that, the rulers of Delhi Sultanate, whose kingdom had been in existence since the 13th century, ruled Bihar
 isliye ye upnaam 13veen se 18veen ke bich kabhi aayaa hoga
 Apart from Brahmins, many other castes also live
 masalan naai, kumhaar, pasiba ityadi
 iske awala kuch islam dharmavalambee bhi gaanv ke miantoli ilaake rahete hai
 His main occupation is to cultivate vegetables and this is how he manages to survive
 inhen log kujra bhi kehete hai
 The most unique thing is that both these Hindus and Muslims live together with a lot of love
 hindu, musalamaanon ke tajia me shariq hote hai or musalmaan hindu parv tyoharon or melon me dikh jate hai
 This thing is special in today's perspective because in most parts of the world, there has been a war on the name of religion
 gaanv kii vishalata ke chalate kai shaadiyaan gaanv ke do pariwaron ke bich hi ho jaati hai
 This thing is also unique in itself
 gaanv kaaphi surakshit he
 There is no fight except for minor differences
 kai logo ki dharna he ki is gaanv ki raksha babaaji swayan karte hai
 Seeing the density of the village, a thief is afraid to fill the village with more steps
 mana jaataa he saalon pehle gaanv ke doordarshee babua khan ne gaanv ke sadakon kii ruparekha kuch aisi rakhi thi kisi ko bhi kukrity karke bhaag janaa aasaan nahin hota
 Babua Khan started the Dharma Sabha in the village more than a hundred years ago, which continues even today
 is sabha me dharm or aadhyatm kii baaten hoti he
 There are two main causes of natural disasters in Bangaon
 pehla kaaran he kosi nadi me ai baad
 kosi nadi ek manmatta nadi he jo apni dhara or disha badalati rahati
 lokgeeton me ise "bataihiya maiyaa" yani unmaadi maa kii sangya di gayi he
 These rivers, originating from the lap of the Himalayas, come to the earth after taking strange turns and finally join the Ganges river and are one of the tributaries of the Ganges
 yah nadi do hisson me vibhakt he
 The western part of the river is 8 km west of the village
 is nadi par band 1950 ke dashak me bana tha
 Before the dam was built, many small streams of Kosi flowed through the village or around it
 band banane ke baad yah kaaphi niyantrit ho gayi he lekin nadi ke puraane bahaav ke nishaan aaj bhi bahutyaat me milane vaali bade bade gaddhon ke rup me maujuud hai
 Before the dam was built, flooding in the village was common
 lekin iske baad se vikaraal rup main sirf ek baar gaanv me barh aayi he
 This happened in 1984 due to the breaking of the dam near Navhatta in Supaul district
 is vajah se aayi barh ke kaaran gaanv ke zyaadaatar hisse me pani ghus aayaa tha
 There was a lot of property damage due to the flood
 gaanv ke ek do log barh kii tej dhara me aa ke bah gaye the
 However, even after this the village was not completely submerged
 gaanv ke madhya kaa hissaa, jo kaaphi unchaa he or pathaar kii akruti kaa he, pani me nahin duba tha
 This village has been witness to another disaster of nature and that is earthquake
 There have been two earthquakes in this village, which has caused damage in the village
 san 1934 me aayaa bukamp bahut khatarnaak tha
 Cracks had occurred in many parts of the village
 richter paimaane pe isaki tivrata 8
1 maapi gayi thi
 This earthquake is one of the most terrible earthquakes not only in Bihar but also in India
 iske baad 1988 me ek baar phir se bukamp aayaa
 Due to this many houses in the village were damaged
 richter paimaane pe isaki tivrata 6
6 thi
 Although this village is far away from the Himalayas, but despite this, earthquakes keep coming here due to the turbulence inside the womb of the earth
 mana jaataa he ki plate tectonix ki vajah se aisa hota he
 In this region inside the earth, the plate of Europe is coming inside the plate of Asia and due to that there are earthquakes
 1988 me aise hi ek subah kute achaanak se bhunkane lage or bijli gul ho gayi
 Shortly thereafter, the water of the chapacallo and wells started coming out
 logo ke gharon ki deevaaron me daraaren aa gayi thi
 But nobody was hurt
 hinduon ke kai parv tyohaar he
 There are many of them which are celebrated in a particular area and there are many such festivals which are celebrated with much enthusiasm of North Indians
 Many such festivals are also celebrated in this village

 Both tetrahydrocarbinol belong to the chemical species

 People here are such a powerful Brahmin

 state bank of india The meaning of the word Dohad means 'desire for pregnant'
 sambhavat: yah sanskrit 'dauhrid' shabd kaa praakrit rup he jo sanskrit main gruhit anya praakrit shabdon ke samaan sweekrut ho gaya he
 According to Yajnavalkya Smriti, this is the beloved behavior of a pregnant woman, which must be fulfilled
 yadi gabhini stri kii is prakaar kii aakankshaayen purna na kii jaaen, unhen garbhavastha main jin vastuon kii ichha hoti he ve na di jaaen to garbhavikruti, maran evam anyaanya dosha hote hai
 The theme of 'dohad' in Sushruta is as follows - In the fourth month due to the pregnancy of women, the organs of the womb are developed and the power of consciousness and the heart of consciousness also arises in this month
 isi samay indriyon ko kuch na kuch vishaybhog karne kii ichha hoti he
 This is called giving a desire for elation
 is kaal main striyon kaa deh do hridayvaala arthath ek apana or doosraa garbhasth santan kaa hota he
 Therefore, this immediate desire is called 'dohad'
 unki yah abhilaashaa agar purna na kii jaae to garbhasth santan kubj, kuni, khanj, jad, vaaman, vikrutaksh, athwa andh hoti he tathaa anyaanya garbhpida kii aashakon bani rahati he
 After the fulfillment of the desired Dohad, the child of the womb is strong, quality and long-lasting
 nahin to garbh ke vishay main athwa swayan garbhini ke liye dar bana rahata he
 Discussing the Dohad on the basis of different senses and things, it is said that the senses of the womb that do not fulfill their desire, future children also suffer the pain of the same senses in their lives
 garbhini ko yadi rajdarshan kii ichha ho to santan sundar or alankaripriy; ashrayadarshan kii ichha ho to dharmsheel or sanyatatma; devpratimadarshan kii ichha ho to santan devatulya; sarpadi vyaljaateey jantu dekhne kii ichha ho to hinsanshil; goh kaa maance khaane kii ichha ho to shur, raktaksh or lomash arthath adhik roenvala; harin kaa maance khaane kii ichha ho to banchar; varah kaa maance khaane kii ichha ho to banchar; varah kaa maance khaane kii ichha ho to nihaal or shur, srup kaa maance khaane kii ichha ho to udign tathaa teetar kaa maance khaane kii ichha ho to santan bheeru hoti he
 Apart from these, if there is a desire to eat the flesh of other animals, then the nature and behavior of the animal, the child will also have the same nature and behavior, so the desire of the womb must be fulfilled
 sahitya main ek pracheen vishwaas, kavismay yaa kaviprasiddhi ke rup main iskaa ullekh miltaa he jahaan vriksh ke saath prayukt hokar yah shabd 'pushpodgam' arth detaa he
 According to Shabdaranava, the fluids and actions by the skilled persons in the taru, gulam, lata, etc
, which are made to flow in a famine, are called Dohad
 shabd kalpadrumakaar ne bhi ise 'pushpodgamakoshdham' pushpon ko utpann karanevaali aushadhi kaha he
 The word has been used in the same sense in Meghdoot, Raghuvansh and Nishadhi Charit
 sanskrit ke kaavyon or murti tathaa chitrashilpon main striyon ke padaaghat se ashok vriksh ke pushpit hone kii bahut charchaa he
 After this the Dohad of Bakul tree is mentioned
 bakul striyon kii mukhmadiraa se sinchakar pushpit hota he
 In the texts of Kalidasa, there is mention of the Dohad of these two trees Ashoka and Bakul
 sahityadarpanakaar vishwanath ne sambhavat: sarvapratham kavismay ke antargat vrikshadohad kaa ullekh kiya he
 Keshav Mishra, in his treatise 'alankarashekhar', has accepted Ashoka and Bakul's Dohad under Kavisamay
 prasiddh tikaakar mallinath bhi vrikshadohad ko 'kavismaygate sathkavinaa prabandhe' kaa ullekh karte hue 'kavismay' yaa 'kaviprasiddhi' ke rup main sweekaar karte hai
 But in Kavyamamsa or his follower texts, 'kavisamay' does not find any discussion on tree tree
 phir bhi kavy mimasaa se kuch vriksh, jaise ashok, bakul, tilak ore kurbak sambandhi prasiddhiyon kaa samarthan hota he
 In Sanskrit literature, these four trees are mostly mentioned in Vriddhodah related famous
 meghdoot ke shloke 'raktashokashchalakislay:' se pataa chalata he ki ashok par padaaghat baayein charandvara kiya jaataa tha
 'ek: Sakhyaastava Sah Maya Vamapadabhilashi Kankshtyanyyo Badan Madira Dohadachhadmnasya:' In this verse, Mallinath mentions the Dohad of many trees according to which the beautiful woman's touch is Priyangu, Mukhmadira from Maulsiri, Charanga Ashoka, Visually Tilak, Alang From Mriduvani, Mandra from laughter, Champa Qurbak with laughter, Mango from melodious songs and Kachnar etc
 with flowers dance
 bhartiya sahitya or murti tathaa chitrashilp main kavismay, kaviprasiddhi yaa pracheen vishwaas ke rup main ullikhit vrikshadohad kaa sambandh kuch vidvan yakshon se jodate hai jo urvartaa tathaa vrishti ke devtaa the
 The Vedic deity Varuna is also associated with Gandharvas, Yakshas, asuras and Nagas
 yadhyapi yakshon naagon ke devtaa kuber, som apsars or adhidevataa varun dikpala ke rup main brahman granthon main sweekrut ho chuke the par baad ke sahitya main yaksha or yakshini apadevataa samajhe jane lage the
 In the Tantric tradition, through the accomplishment of Yakshini, it is also accepted to have a variety of opulent acts in untimely
 karpurmanjari main bhairavanand yogi, prithvirajraso main amarsingh severa aadi isi bal par anek prakaar ke asambhav or ascharyajanak krity karne main purnat: ksham the
 The suzerainty of water and trees, which was the old term of the Yakshas, is also accepted in Ramayana and Mahabharata
 mahabharat main aisi anek kathaayen aati hai jinamein santanarthini striyaan vrikshon ke upadewataa yakshon ke paas santan kii kaamana se jaati thim
 In Bharhut, Sanchi, Mathura, etc
, the idols of Santhanarthini women visiting this tree and getting a bride from the Yakshas are found very much
 isse prathit hota he ki vastut: yaksha or yakshini mul rup se urvartaa ke hi dev the or jis prakaar vrikshadevataa striyon main dohasanchaar karte the usee prakaar sundari striyon kii adhishthatri yakshiniyan bhi stri-ang-sansparsh se vrikshon main dohad sanchaar karti thim
 Statues of women communicating in the Ashoka tree are very familiar in Indian sculpture
 bhartiya aaryon ne uttar kii in jatiyon ko unke samgr gunon ke saath apane main is prakaar mila liya ki ve ekmec ho gayi
 Udayan in Brihatkathamanjari, Kathasaritsagar etc
 and it is known from the stories of his son Narvarma that the time must have been the unification of these castes
 sahitya main pracheen vishwaas, kavismay, kaviprasiddhi aadi ke rup main vrikshadohad kaa ullekh sambhavat: isi ekikaran kii ore ingit karata he
 Eating or drinking substances for the peace of defects arising due to direction, warp and date at the time of travel
 muhurtchintamani main iskaa vivaran praapt hota he jo is prakaar he : There is a flaw in going to the east, which comes from eating ghee in peace; If there is any defect in going west, then by eating fish; If there is any defect in going south, by eating sesame pudding and going north, then it becomes calm by drinking milk
 naarad ke matanusaar purv kii ore jane main ghrutann, pashchim main matsyann, uttar main ghrit or dakshin main kheer khaakar jane se shubh hota he
 Ghee on Sunday, milk on Monday, jaggery on Mars, sesame on Mercury, barley on Jupiter, barley on Venus and urad on Saturday brings peace to travel related problems
 pratipad main madar kaa patta, dwitiya main chaaval kaa dhoyaa hua pani, tritiya main ghi, chaturthi main yavagu, panchami main havishya, shashthee main suvarnaprakshalit jal, saptami main apup, ashtami main bijpoorak, navami main jal, dashami main strigavimutra, ekadshi main yavann, dwadashi main paayas, trayodashi main eekh kaa gud, chaturdashi main rakt, poornima or amavasya main moong kaa bhaat khaakar jane se shubh hota he
