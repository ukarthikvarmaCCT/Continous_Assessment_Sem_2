 The poetry of Lokmangal has the power to review Shukla ji as well as the limits
 uski shakti kavyanibaddh jivan ke vyaavhaarik or vyapak arthon ke maarmik anusandhan main nihit he
 But the predetermined moral center of his criticism also limits his literary depiction on many occasions

 The objects that appear in the sky sometimes moving from one side to another or falling on the earth are called 'breaking stars' or 'luka' in meteor and common colloquium
 ulkaon kaa jo ansh vayumandal main jalane se bachakar prithvi tak pahunchataa he use ulkapind kehete hai
 Meteors can be seen in countless numbers each night, but the number of bodies that fall on the earth is very small
 vaigyanik drushti se inkaa mahatv bahut adhik he kyonki ek to ye ati durlabh hote hai, duusare akaash main vichrate hue vibhinn grahon ityadi ke sanghathan or sanrachana ke gyaan ke pratyaksh strot keval ye hi pind hai
 By studying them, we also get a sense of what are the reactions on the matter coming from the sky in the global environment
 is prakaar ye pind brahmandavidya or bhuvigyaan ke bich sampark sthapit karte hai
 Although man was familiar with these falling stars from very ancient times, in the development of modern science, it took a long time for man to believe that these bodies found on the ground came from the sky on earth

 In 1768, Father Basile automatically saw a meteorite coming to Earth at a place called Luce in France
 agle varsh usne paris kii vigyaan kii royal academi ke adhiveshan main is vrittant par ek lekh padhaa
 Not believing the account, the Academy appointed a commission to investigate the incident, reporting that Father Basile's account was misleading, stating that the body of the body had become somewhat glassy due to lightning
 This led to the confusion of Basile that these bodies are not part of the earth
 tadnantar german darshanik cladni ne san 1794 i
 main siberia se praapt ek ulkapind kaa adhyayan karte hue yah siddhant prastaavit kiya ki ye pind khamandal ke pratinidhi hote hai
 Although this idea was not immediately accepted even this time, Claudney received the credit for drawing attention to this topic and since then scientists began to give more attention to the subject
 san 1803 i
 main france main laa agil sthaan par ulkapindon kii ek bahut badi vrishti hui jisamen anginat chote-bade pathar gire or unamem se praaia: do-teen hajaar ikatthe bhi kiye ja sake
 The French Academy of Sciences thoroughly researched the rain, and in the end no one suspected that meteorites actually came to Earth from the mantle
 ulkapindon kaa mukhya vargeekaran unke sanghathan ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Some bodies are mostly made of iron, nickel or alloys and some resemble stones made of silicate minerals
 pehle vargvaalon ko dhatvik or duusare vargvaalon ko aashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In addition, metallic and surprising substances are often found in the same quantity in some bodies, they are called metallic meteorites
 vastut: purnataya dhatvik or purnataya aashmik ulkpindon ke bich sabhi prakaar kii ant:sth jatiyon ke ulkapind paae jate hai jisase pindon ke varg kaa nirnay karnaa bahudhaa kathin ho jaataa he
 Depending on the structure, strains are made in all three classes
 aashmik pindon main do mukhya upbhed hai jinamein se ek ko kaundrite or duusare ko akundrite kehete hai
 The main feature of the first subclass is that some specific circular grains, called caudreule, are present in them
 jin pindon main kaundrul upasthit nahin rahete unhen akundrite kehete hai
 There are also two main strains in metallic meteorites which are called Ashtaniq and Shasthanik respectively
 ye naam pindon kii antarrachana vyakt karte hai or jaisaa in naamon se vyakt hota he, pehle vibhed ke pindon main dhatvik padaarth ke bandha ashtani aakaar main or duusare main shashthinik aakaar main vinyast hote hai
 This type of composition is called Vidmanstetter and it can be identified with great ease on the leaf page of the body
 dhatvashmik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upvarg hai jinhen krmanusaar pelesite or ardhdhathwik kehete hai
 The surprising part of the first subclass of these bodies is mainly made up of olivine minerals, which are often circular and are incorporated into a system of ferrous-nickel metals
 ardhdhathwik ulkapindon main mukhyat: piroxin or alp maatra main anaurthite felsapaar vidyaman hote hai
 It has been mentioned in the earlier case that meteorites are classified based on the primacy of metallic and astral organs
 kintu in pindon main rasinic tatwon or khanijon ke vitaran ke sambandh main koi sunishchit aadhaar prathit nahin hota
 Apart from the three main classes of meteorites, there are several subclasses, each with its own distinct mineral community
 abhi tak praaia: 25 nae virgon kaa pataa laga he or praaia: prati do varsh ek nae upvarg kaa pataa lagata rahaa he
 The difficulty is that the materials available for study are very small
 abhi tak ulkapindon main keval 52 rasinic tatwon kii upasthiti pramanit hui he jinke naam nimnlikhit hai:

 Potassium Lithium
 helium Of these 52 elements, only eight are found in abundance, of which Hall is the most prominent
 anya saat main krmanusaar oxijan, silicon, manganisheium, gandhak, aluminium, nikal or calcium hai
 In addition to these, 20 other elements are found in sufficient quantity and their presence was detected before 1926 by simple chemical analysis
 shesh 24 tatv atyant alp maatra main vidyaman hai evam unki upasthiti varnakramadarshaki vishleshan se siddh kii gai he
 From the point of view of mineral composition there are many differences in the characteristics of meteorites and rocks found in the earth
 saadharantaya bhumandaleey shail raashiyon main swatantra dhaatu rup main loha tathaa nikal atyant durlabh hote hai, kintu ulkapindon main dhaatuen shuddh rup main bahut prachurtaa se tathaa praaia: anivaaryat: pai jaati hai
 In addition, there are many minerals that are not found in terrestrial rocks, but are found in meteorites
 inamen se pramukh oldemite or shribersite hai
 Both these minerals are not permanent in abundance of moisture and oxygen and hence are not found in global rocks
 inaki upasthiti se yah bodh hota he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti aise vaataavaran main hui jahaan bhumandal kii apeksha oxidikaran kii paristhitiyaan nune rahi hongi
 Astounding meteorites generally lack the abundance of pyroxene and olivine and lack of feldspar, making their organization similar to the superfamous rocks of the planet
 ulkapindon kii utpatti kaa vishay bahut hi vivaadaaspad he
 Several views have been proposed on this subject from time to time, in some of which they have been considered as part of Earth, Moon, Sun and Comet etc
 ek ati maanya mat ke anusaar inaki utpatti ek aise grah se hui jo ab purnataya vinasht ho gaya he
 In this view, it is imagined that in the beginning, there must have been a planet in the shape of Mars which was destroyed when it came very close to another big planet, or collided with another planet, due to which billions of small number Large blocks formed which are visible in meteorite form
 is mat ke anusaar dhatvik ulka us kalpit grah kaa kendriya bhaag tathaa aashmik ulka upree prishth nirupit karte hai
 Although this metaphor explains many symptoms of meteorites, many things remain an incomprehensible puzzle
 udaahranarth kuch dhatvik ulkapindon main ashtani rachana hoti he jo saadharantaya 800 degree centegrade taap par nasht ho jaati he
 It is believed that during the fission of that fictitious planet, there must have been more heat in it
 phir bhi yah samaj main nahin aata ki yah ashtani rachana vinasht hone se kaise bachi
 Similarly, there is also doubt as to where the iron came from in the Akundrite Awesome Meteor and how Kaunduyul was formed in the Kondrite Awesome Meteor
 ek anya mat main yah prastaavit kiya gaya he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti grahon ke saath saath ho hui, athwa yon kahana chahie ki soramandal evam samast khamandaleey padaartho kii utpatti ulkapindon se hi hui
 According to this fantasy, the primordial world was full of meteorites and in time, those bodies gathered in different masses and according to their maximum density, gasamic noharica, constellations and planets were born
 is kalpana kii ek badi truti yah prathit hoti he ki khamandal main upasthit ulkapind itani dur-dur chhitaraaye hue hai tathaa unka parsparik aakarshan itnaa ksheen he ki unke ekatra hokar badi raashi banane main atyadhik samay lagegaa
 But there is no doubt that once a sufficiently large amount of money is formed, it will be able to retain its power and will eventually increase its size by adding more bodies
 sambhav he, uparyukt vidhiyon main anshat: sanshodhan karne se inaki utpatti kii vaastavik vidhi nirdhaarit ho sake
 a large collection of meteorites is on display in the Geological Department of the Indian Museum of Calcutta
 isaki dekharekh bhartiya bhuvaigyanik surveykshan sanstha ke nirikshan main hoti he
 According to the prevailing rules, meteorites dropped anywhere in the country are government property
 jis kisi ko aisa pind mili uskaa kartavya he ki vah use sthaneey jiladhish ke paas pahunchaa de jahaan se vah bhartiya bhuvaigyanik surveykshan vibhaag ko bhej diya jaataa he
 Thus gradually this collection has become unique in its way
 iske atirikt is sangrah main videshon se bhi praapt namoonay rakhe gaye hai

 jis mitti main nimna aakaar ke kanon kaa sanmishran acha hota he, uskaa ghanatv ucchtam hota he
 To maintain the strength of condensed soil, it is necessary that it is resistant to the softening effect of water
 iske liye mitti main cement, chuunaa, rasayanak yaa bitumani padaarth milaate hai
 It has already been reported that the soil mainly consists of sand, silt and clay
 inke saath hi usamen kuch viley or kuch aviley lavan bhi rahete hai, jaise calcium tathaa magneshium ke carbonate or sodium evam potacium ke chloride tathaa sulphate
 Organic materials of varying concentrations also exist in many forms
 ye sabhi mitti ke rasinic vyavhaar ko prabhavit karte hai
 As stated earlier, sand and silt are inert and the clay is chemically active, so the chemical properties of clay are dependent on the clay
 mrittika anek tatwon, jaise loh, aluminium, silicon aadi kii jatil sanrachana ke rup main bani he
 Some properties of mineral composite of clay are unique
 yah pani main aviley hota he, par usamen nilambit avasthaa main rah saktaa he
 It remains suspended depending on the size of the particles
 nilambit avasthaa main yah amleey abhikriya detaa he
 Its acidity is acidity of acetic acid
 is amlata kaa udaasinikaran calcium or sodium ke hydroxide sadyash kisi kshareey padaarth se kiya ja saktaa he
 As a result, calcium and sodium soils are formed
 daanedaar sanrachana ke kaaran calsicham mitti krishi kesh liye upyukt he, par sodium mitti jalaabhedh hone ke kaaran band or sadakon ke nirmaan ke liye adhik upyogi he
 Calcium ion is absorbed by the soil and stabilized so that it dissolves by pure water but is easily replaced by other salts
 udhaaharan ke liye calcium mitti ko jab namak ke vilyan se apkshalit kiya jaataa he, tab usase sodium mitti banati he or calcium ayan chloride ke rup main vilyan main aa jaataa he
 Sodium soil can then be converted into calcium, or other metals of clay, by bleaching it with calcium, or other clay solutions
 mitti ke is gun ko, jisamen kshaaron kaa vinimay hota he, " mittish kaa vinimay gun' kehete hai or vinimay hone vaala dhanayan vaali mittiyaan hoti hai, jinamein calcium, sodium, potacium tathaa mangneshium pramukh hai or nickel, cobalt, boran aadi badi alp maatra main rahete hai, yadhyapi paudhon kii vruddhi ke liye ye aavashyak hai
 These elements living in microscopic quantities are called Anuposha "tattva"
 kisi mrid bhaag main dhanayan kaa pratishat vinimay dharita par nirbhar karata he, jo maantmarilonite koti kii mitti main adhik or keolinite koti kii mitti main kam hoti he
 The example of montmorillonite grade soil is cotton black soil, which is spread in parts of Madhya Pradesh, Madras and Bombay in India
 keolinite mitti saadharantya bharat ke jalodh maidaanon main pai jaati he
 As indicated earlier, the soil that is highly depleted of interchangeable alkali by the treatment of dilute acid has the highest hydrogen ion concentration and consequently the lowest ph
 jyon jyon mitti main sodium calcium jaise vinimeya ayan milaae jate hai, tyon tyon uskaa pi ech badhata jaataa he
 The highest ph of soil reaches about 11
 vaastavik kshetra paristhiti main isse kuch adhik pi ech dekha gaya he, kintu uskaa kaaran vinimeya dhanayan nahin hai, balki sodium carbonate jaisaa viley lavan he, jo kshareey mitti main saadharantaya rahata he
 Exceeding a certain limit of such salts prevents the growth of crops
 lekin ejiniyari sanrachana ke liye mitti main sodium carbonate kaa hona laabhadaayak hota he
 The presence of these salts transforms soil sodium into soil, which in the ground state has greater water resistance than calcium soil
 falat: nam avasthaa main bhi mitti kii shakti bani rahati he, jo ejiniyari sanrachana ke liye aavashyak he
 The three main components of natural land are sand, silt and clay
 inke kanon ke aakaar main to antar he hi, inke rasinic tathaa bhautik gun bhi bhinn hai
 The sand is generally made of silica and rhinestone
 silica or sphatik niskriy hote hai
 The size of the sand ranges from 0
06 mm 0 to 2 mm 0
 ret ke kanon main sansanjan or keshikatv nahin hota, kintu pargamyata adhik hoti he
 The components of silt are silica and crystalline, but the size of its particles varies from 0
0002 mm 0 to 0
06 mm 0
 silt ke kanon main sansanjan nahin hota, lekin keshikatv kaaphi hota he
 The size of soil particles is less than 0
002 mm 0
 ret or silt se isaki asamanta yah he ki mitti ke kan rasayanat: aavisht hone ke kaaran rasayanakon sa abhikriya karte hai
 The excess of soil brings capillarity and cohesion in the soil
 aisi bhoomi geeli hone par phoolati he tathaa sookhne par sikudti he
 These apparent physical properties of the soil are due to the high percentage of colloidal particles in it, causing the adsorption of hydrogen, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, etc
 from the surface
 ye ayan vinimeya hai, arthath vilyan main ye duusare ayanon se pratisthapaneey hai
 The highest ability to adsorb these ions is called the exchange capacity of alkali
 ayanon kii ksharak bhi utana hi adhik hoga
 The properties of the soil depend on the adsorbed cation on the surface
 bhinn bhinn mittiyon ke rasinic avyav ek hi hai, arthath maatra main, ,, ke saath, , tathaa jal, kintu bhinnn mittiyon main khanij yogic bhinn hote hai
 X-rays and homogeneous rock analysis of many scientists The X-rays and homogeneous rock analysis experiments of many scientists have resulted in two groups of clay minerals
 vargeekaran kaa aadhaar crystal jaalak kii banaavat he
 See - Ceramic is samooh ke khanij silica or alumina ke ek ek chaadaron se bane hote hai
 The crystal lattice of the mineral of this group is made of two unit silica sheets and one unit alumina sheet
 crystal jaalak sanrachana kii bhinnata ke falswaroop in do samoohon kii mittiyon ke rasinic tathaa bhautik gunon main mahaan antar hota he
 The alkali regulation holdings of kaolin minerals are low and their adsorption properties are also low, while the cation-adsorption of montmalonite minerals occurs

 He was the first painter who realized that the most powerful and beautiful is the luxury of light and shadow in the scenery of the world
 isliye inhone rang or rekhaon ke saath saath ise bhi uchit mahatv diya
 The extraordinary scenes and forms always attracted him and found a place in his memory

 No sculpture of him is now found, but it is said that the three statues at the northern gate of the Baptistry of Florence, the bronze mounted statue placed in the Museum of Budapest and the first, protected, waxed, statue of Flora in the Berlin Museum Was produced under the direction of Leonardo
 kuch anya murtiyon ke sambandh main bhi aisa hi vichaar he, par nishchit rup se kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa
 It seems that Leonardo wanted to write different texts on painting, architecture, anatomy, astrology, optics, hydrology and mechanics, but this work was not completed
 in vishyon par inke keval apurna lekh yaa tippaniyan prapya hai
 Leonard had considered so many scientific topics and his comments on many of them are so detailed that their description is not possible here

 File transfer protocol is a network protocol through which files are exchanged over an Internet-based TCP / IP network
 ise upayokta aadhaarit kuta yaa anonimas yujar acces ke dwaara kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Now with FTP servers in almost every institution, this system does not work
 anek haal ke web broujar or file prabandhak apatpi sarvaron se jud sakate hai
 This can do the same thing as local files on files coming from remote locations
 isamen apatpi yuarel prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Other methods of sending files such as SFTP and SCP are not associated with FTP
 inaki puri prakriya main esaech kaa prayog hota he
 The File Transfer Protocol or FTP in its current form has arrived at various stages
 sarvapratham 16 april, 1971 main ise refsi 114 ke naam se taiyaar kiya gaya tha jise baad main june, 1980 main refsi 765 se badla gaya jise san aktubar 1985 main refsi 959 se parivartit kiya gaya
 After that, many security related changes came
 ye suraksha sambandhi badlaav isliye laae gaye the kyonki aarambh main sanchikaayen bhejne kaa yah tarika bahut asurakshit tha
 The main reason for this vulnerability was that anyone could steal or copy that file on the same network in the process of sending the file
 achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet se purv yah internet protocol ke kaaryakshetra main aane vaali ek aam samasya bani hui thi
 This problem was possible only through SFTP
 apatpi ko sakriy mod, niskriy mod or vistrut niskriy mod main sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he
 In September 1998 by RFC 2428, extended passive mode was added
 network par data antarit karte samay, kai data pratinidhitiv kiye ja sakate hai
 There are two most common transfer modes: FTP sarwar vaapasi code, apane bheetar ke ankon dwaara apni sthiti suchit karte hai
 The basic FTP specification is an inherently unsafe method of transferring files, as there is no specified method of transferring data in an encrypted manner
 iskaa arth yah he ki adhikansh network vinyason ke antargat, prayokta naam, password, afatipi cmand or antarit sanchikaayen, ek packet sansuchak ke upyog dwaara usee network par avasthit koi bhi antarit sanchikaon ko hathiyaa saktaa he
 This has been a common problem for many Internet protocol specifications written prior to the creation of SSL such as HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet
 is samasya ke liye aam samaadhaan he esaftipi, yaa apatpies, jo arefasi 4217 main vinirdisht tareeqe se afatipi main esasail yaa tles ancripshan jodate hai
 a host providing FTP service is additionally capable of providing anonymous FTP access
 prayokta naam ke liye puche jane par, prayokta saamaanya taur par 'anaam' khate kii seva main log-in karte hai
 Although users are generally asked to send their e-mail address in lieu of a password, little or no verification of the supplied information is done
 chunki aadhunik afatipi client aam taur par prayokta se anaam pravesh prakriya ko chhupate hai, afatipi client, password ke rup main nakli data kii aapurti kar sakate hai kyonki anuprayog ko prayokta kaa i-mail pataa gyaat nahin ho saktaa he
 The Gopher protocol, as well as the simple file transfer protocol and file service protocol, have been suggested as an alternative to anonymous FTP
 jahaan apatpi acces prayog main nahin aata, vahaan doorvarti yaa remote apatpi yaa apatpi mail prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 In this, an email is sent to another FTP server that completes the FTP command and sends back an attachment containing the download file
 yah khaskar vahaan prayog main laayaa jaataa he, jahaan FTP pahunch pratibandhit ho
 An e-mail containing the FTP command to be executed is sent to the remote FTP server
 yah ek mail sarwar hota he jo aavak i-mail ko pars karata he, afatipi commandon ko karyanvit karata he or atachament ke rup main downlod kiye gaye kisi sanchika ke saath i-mail waapas bhejtaa he
 This is obviously less flexible than an FTP client, as directories cannot be seen interacting or modifying commands, and replies may also have problems with large file attachments escaping through the mail server
 aajkal adhikansh internet prayoktaaon ke paas afatipi kaa pahunch sulabh he, atah yah prakriya dainandin upyog main prachlit nahin he
 Currently modern and recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers, although they may lack support for protocol extensions such as FTPS
 yah afatipi par doorvarti sanchikaon kii adla-badali main sthaneey sanchikaon ke liye prayukt interfes jaise madhyam ko anumat karata he
 This is done by an FTP URL
 yah is rup main hota he: Alternatively a password can be provided in the URL, eg: adhikansh web brouzaron ko niskriy mod afatipi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jisase puraa karne hetu sabhi afatipi sarwar sakasham nahin hai
 Some browsers only allow files to be downloaded, but do not provide any means to upload files to the server
 ypi pate or port cmand par port sankhyaon kaa pratinidhitiv or pieesavi uttar, network pataa anuwaad upkarnon ke liye FTP se nipatane main ek or chunauti he
 These values have to be changed by the NAT tool, so that they include the IP address of the nat-ed client and the port selected by the NAT device for the data connection
 nayaa pataa or port sambhawatah unke dashamalav pratinidhitiv kii lambaai main apane mul pate or port se alag hon
 This means that the value on the control connection must be carefully changed, with the NAT tool changing the TCP sequence and acknowledgment fields for all subsequent packets
 adhikansh NAT upkarnon main aam taur par is tarah ke anuwaad nahin kiye jate hai, balki is uddeshy ke liye vishesh anuprayog stareey get-ve uplabdh rahete hai
 FTP over SSH refers to the use of creating a normal FTP session container over an SSH connection
 afatipi ek se adhik tisipi conekshnon kaa upyog karata he, atev esaech par tunnel bananaa vishesh rup se kathin hota he
 As with many SSH clients, attempting to prepare the tunnel for the control channel would only protect the channel; When data is transferred, FTP software on both ends will establish TCP connections, which will pass over the SSH connection to the bypass, thus securing privacy, integrity protection, etc
 anyathaa, esaech client software ke liye afatipi protocol kaa vishisht gyaan or afatipi niyantran sandeshon kii nigaraanee or punarlekhan tathaa swytt rup se afatipi data channelon ke liye nae agreshan kholana aavashyak hota zaruri he
 Version 3 of SSH Communications Security's software parikar and FONC licensed by GPL are two software packages that support this mode
 SSH kii apeksha FTP ko kabhi-kabhi surakshit FTP ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa he; ise FTP surakshit karne kii SSL / TLS jaisi anya paddati nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Other methods of transferring files using SSH include SFTP and SCP, which are not related to FTP; In each of these, the entire conversation is always protected by the SSH protocol
 pitrusatta ek saamaajik vyavastha he jisame purushon kii praathmik satta hoti hai
 In the roles of political leadership, moral authority, social respect, control of property prevail

 In this system, women and men have to study according to the work given by the society
 dharm, samaaj va roodhiwaadee paramparaayen pitrusatta ko adhik taaqatvar banaati hai
 For centuries women are being oppressed due to patriarchy
 parivaar ke alag alag prakaar hote hai par sabhi prakaar ke pariwaron main pitrasatta prachilit hoti he
 Sexual relations of adults in the family are socially accepted
 1
 kutumbon ke prakaar: ekal parivaar or sanyukt parivarekal parivaar vah parivaar hota hai jiname zayaadaatar keval teen yaa chaar log hote hai, mata-pita or unke bachche
 It focuses on married couples
 aaj kal ekal abhibhavak bhi ekal parivaar mana jaataa he
 The term single family first appeared in the 20th century
 sanyukt parivaar sadiyon se prachlit hai
 Many individuals are part of two single families in their lives, one single family in which they are born and the other in which they marry and settle their home
 aadya audyogikaran or jaldi poonjeevaad ke udbhav ke saath, ekal parivaar ek aarthik rup se vyavhaarya saamaajik ikai ban gaya 1
2sanyukt parivaar vah hota hai jiname sadhano kaa sampradayik prayog karte he, jaise ek vivaahit joda jab apane mata-pita or kabhi kabhi bhai baheno ke saath rahete hai
 Joint family is a tradition in India
 abhi bhi desh ke bahut jagaaon main sanyukt parivaar maujuud he
 The joint family is present in all the villages except big big cities and in all small cities
 aise parivaar ek kulapati ke netritv main hote hai
 The man makes all the decisions
 paariwarik aay unki niyantran main hai
 The patriarch's wife is capable of making family decisions
 shaharikaran or aarthik vikaas ke kaaran bharat main sanyukt pariwaron kam hote ja rahen he
 Sometimes people of many generations are found living together in the same family
 kuch samaajon main sanyukt pariwaron ko ekal pariwaron se behatar mana jaataa he kyonki in pariwaron main ekajutata kaa bhav zyaada hota he, or saath hi saath saanskrithik niyamo or mulyon kaa behatar tareeke se prachran hota he
 In joint families, family relationships are given more importance than marital relationships
 ek sanyukt parivaar main aam taur par ek kulapati kaa netritv hota he
 This system is called patriarchy
 aise gharon main purush pradhan hota he, wo parivaar kaa paalan poshan karata he
 Paternity pairs are less common in single families than in joint families

 kintu yuddh samaapt hote hi, ek ore britain tathaa sanyukt rajya america tathaa duusari ore soviet sangh main teevr matbhed utpann hone laga
 Very soon these differences created a terrible state of tension
 shityudh ke lakshan dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan hi prakat hone lage the
 Both the superpowers were fighting the war keeping in mind their narrow interests and showing the spirit of mutual cooperation
 jo sahyog kii bhaavana yuddh ke dauraan dikhaai de rahi thi, vah yuddh ke baad samaapt hone lagi thi or shityudh ke lakshan spasht taur par ubharne lag gaye the, donon guton main hi ek duusare kii shikaayat karne kii bhaavana balwati ho gai thi
 There were some strong grounds for these complaints
 rus ke netritv main samyavaadee or america ke netritv main poonjeewaadi desh do khemon main bant gayi
 The two sides never clashed face to face, but these two groups continued to create such an atmosphere that the danger of war was always visible
 berlin sankat, korea yuddh, soviet rus dwaara aanvik pareekshan, sainik sanghathan, hind china kii samasya, you-2 vimaan kand, cuba missile sankat kuch aisi paristhitiyaan thim jinhone shityudh kii agni ko prajvalit kiya
 With the dissolution of Soviet Russia in 1991, its power was reduced and the Cold War ended
 shityudh kii utpatti ke pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit hai- The Yalta Conference was held in 1945 between Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin, in which the convention agreed to recognize representative governance in Poland
 lekin yuddh kii samaapti ke samay stallin ne vaayade se mukarte hue vahaan par apni lubnin sarkaar ko hi sahaayta dena shuru kar diya
 He refused to allow US and UK observers to enter there and began arresting Poland's populist leaders
 usne samjhaute kii sharton ke vipareet hungary, romania, checkoslovakia tathaa bulgaria main bhi apana prabhaav badhanaa shuru kar diya, usne dhuree shaktiyon ke viruddh pashchimi rashtron kii madad karne main bhi hichkichaahat dikhaai
 He also tried to provide indirect assistance to the Communist Party of China
 usne manchuriya sankat ke samay apana samjhauta virdohi rukh prakat kiya
 In this way, by acting contrary to the Yalta Agreement, the Soviet Union gave birth to a sense of mutual distrust and disharmony which later became the basis of the Cold War
 yuddh ke samay hi in donon mahashaktiyon main vaicharik matbhed ubharne lage the
 The Soviet Union wanted to promote communism while America was a strong supporter of capitalism
 soviet sangh ne samaajawaadee aandolanon ko badhaava dene kii jo niti apanaai usne america ke man main avishvaas kii bhaavana ko janm de diya
 The Soviet Union described its policy as just and necessary
 isse poonjeevaad ko gaharaa aghat pahunchaaya or anek poonjivadi raashtra america ke paksh main hokar soviet sangh kii samaajawaadee nitiyon kii ninda karne lage
 Thus the lack of synergy in capitalism versus socialist ideology led to the Cold War between the two superpowers
 soviet sangh ne pratham vishwayuddh ke dauraan hi apane rashtriya hiton main vruddhi karne ke liye prayaas shuru kar diye the
 The possibility of the impact of the socialist revolution of 1917 on other nations also increased
 duusare vishwayuddh ke dauraan uske shakti pradarshan ne pashchimi rashtron ke man main irshyaa kii bhaavana paidaa kar di thi or pashchimi shaktiyon ko bhay lagane laga tha ki soviet sangh isi takat ke bal par puure vishwa main apana samyavaadee kaarykram failaane kaa prayaas karegaa
 He remained silent during the Second World War, but after the war he expressed concern over the growing power of the Soviet Union
 unhone soviet sangh virdohi nitiyaan amal main lani shuru kar di
 They intensified efforts to unite western nations against the Soviet Union
 isse sheet-yuddh ko badhaava milanaa swaabhaavik hi tha
 The Soviet Union and the Western powers had signed an agreement to withdraw their forces from Iran within 6 months after Germany's surrender during World War II itself
 yuddh kii samaapti par pashchimi rashtron ne to vaayade ke mutabik dakshini iran se apni senaayen hataane kaa vaayada puraa kar diya lekin soviet sangh ne aisa nahin kiya
 He pressured Iran to enter into a long-term oil deal with it
 isse pashchimi rashtron ke man main dwesh kii bhaavana paidaa ho gai
 Later, under pressure from the United Nations, it withdrew forces from northern Iran
 soviet sangh kii is samjhauta virdohi niti ne sheet yuddh ko janm diya
 After the Second World War, the Soviet Union began to exert its pressure in Turkey
 usne turki par kuch pradesh or vosphorus main ek sainik adda banane ke liye dabaav daalaa
 America and other Western nations were against it
 is dauraan america ne truman siddhanth kaa pratipaadan karke turki ko har sambhav sahaayta dene kaa prayaas kiya taaki vahaan par samyavaadee prabhaav ko kam kiya ja sake
 These conflicting actions encouraged the Cold War
 1944 ke samjhaute ke tahat yunaan par britain kaa adhikaar uchit tehraaya gaya tha
 But after the Second World War, Britain withdrew its military base from there in view of its economic development
 soviet sangh ne yunaan main grihayuddh chhidane par vahaan ke samyavaadiyon me madad kerani shuru kar di
 Western powers came forward to support the traditional government
 america ne marshall yojana or truman sidvant ke tahat yunaan main apni puri takat laga di
 The communist program was deeply shocked in Greece and the Soviet Union's dream was shattered, so it was only natural to encourage the Cold War in this environment
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan hitler ke netritv main jab german senaayen teji se soviet sangh kii taraf bad rahi thi to soviet sangh ne apni baari jaan-maal ke nuksaan ko rokane ke liye pashchimi rashtron se sahaayta kii maang kii
 The Soviet Union said that the Western powers should quickly open a second front in the Soviet Union to reduce Germany's velocity so that the Russian military could reduce Germany's pressure
 lekin pashchimi shaktiyon ne jaan boojhkar doosraa morcha kholane main bahut der kii
 This gave the German forces a chance to wreak havoc in Russia
 isse soviet sangh ke man pashchimi shaktiyon ke viruddh nafrat kii bhaavana paidaa ho gai jo aage chalakar sheet-yuddh ke rup main prakat hui
 During the Second World War the Western powers adopted a policy of appeasement rather than protecting the Allies against the invasions of the Axis powers
 unhone jaanboojhkar apane mitra rashtron ko sahaayta nahin pahunchaai or apane mitra rashtron ko dhuree shaktiyon ke haathon parajeet or apane mitra rashtron ko dhuree shaktiyon ke haathon parajeet hone dene ke liye baadhya kiya
 This created a feeling of mistrust in many minds about pre-war treaties and agreements, which eventually led to the Cold War
 balkan samjhaute ke tahat 1944 main purvi europe kaa vibhaajan karne par soviet sangh tathaa britain main sahmati hui thi
 Under this, it was agreed to accept the influence of the Soviet Union on Bulgaria and Roumania and Britain's influence on Greece
 hungary tathaa yugoslavia main donon kaa baraabar prabhaav maanane kii baat kahi gai thi
 But at the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union expected the influence of Britain to speed up its communist spread and establish communist governments in those countries
 isse pashchimi rashtron ne gaiyr-samjhautavaadi kaary kaha
 This led to increasing distances between the Soviet Union and the Western powers and created an atmosphere of cold war
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan america ne gupt tareeke se apana parmaanu kaarykram viksit kiya or soviet sangh kii sahmati ke bina hi usne japan ke do shaharon par parmaanu bam gira die
 The US gave rise to a feeling of mistrust by not disclosing its combat technology to the Soviet Union
 isse soviet sangh va pashchimi shaktiyon ke bich sahyog ke kaaryakramon ko gaharaa aghat pahunchaa
 The Soviet Union could not bear a monopoly on America's nuclear program
 isse uske man main yah shankaa paidaa ho gai ki pashchimi rashtron ko usase ghrinaa he
 This sentiment gave rise to the Cold War
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad donon mahashaktiyon ek duusare ke khilaaf prachaar abhiyaan main jute gai
 In 1946 Soviet Russia reported in the report of the Canadian Royal Commission that the Communist Party of Canada was 'one arm of the Soviet Union'
 isse sarkari or gaiyr sarkari kshetron main soviet sangh ke samyavaadee prachaar kii joardaar ninda hui
 This made the Soviet Union also cautious and began to criticize the US strongly, a clear example of the Munro doctrine asking communist forces to be vigilant to increase their influence in the Western Hemisphere
 isi tarah truman siddhanth tathaa american seenet dwaara khule rup main soviet videsh niti kii aalochana kii jane lagi
 The Soviet Union then launched a vigorous propaganda campaign against the US and other Western nations to mobilize communist forces
 is prachaar abhiyaan ne paraspar vaimnasy kii shankaa kii bhaavana ko janm diya jo aage chalakar shityudh ke rup main duniya ke saamne aayaa
 Under the agreement reached between the US and the Soviet Union during the Second World, the Soviet Union was getting insufficient aid, but the US closed it without any prior notice
 is nirnay se soviet sangh kaa naaraaz hona swaabhaavik hi tha
 The Soviet Union tightened its attitude against it, considering it to be a thoughtful move of America
 isse dono mahashaktiyon main aapasi avishvaas kii bhaavana adhik balwati hui or isse shityudh kaa vaataavaran taiyaar ho gaya
 It was only after the Second World War that America and other Western countries started making efforts to increase their relations with Italy
 isse soviet sangh ko shaq hua ki italy main fasiwad ko badhaava dene tathaa samyawad ko kamjor karne main inhen takaton kaa haath he
 This made the Soviet Union see its role in international relations shrinking
 is soch ne donon ke madhya dooriyaan badha di
 It was during World War II that the Soviet Union gained control over East Berlin and the United States and Britain to West Berlin
 yuddh ke baad pashchimi takaton ne apane shretradhin berlin pradesh main nai mudra kaa prachlan shuru karne kaa faisla kiya
 In June 1948, the Soviet Union put a blockade against Berlin against this decision
 iske parinamswaroop soviet sangh va america yaa britain ke bich hue protocol kaa ulanghan ho gaya
 The Soviet Union was blamed for this
 soviet sangh apana dosha sweekaar karne ko taiyaar nahin tha
 With this, the matter reached the Security Council and a cold war clouded between the two superpowers
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh kii samaapti ke baad sanyukt raashtra sangh kii sthapana hui
 Five countries received veto power in this institution
 soviet sangh ne baar-baar apni is shakti kaa prayog karke pashchimi rashtron ke prayek suzav ko maanane se inkaar kar diya, is tarah america tathaa pashchimi rashtron dwaara sanyukt raashtra sangh main laae gaye prayek prastaav ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 This led to the US and Western nations criticizing the Soviet Union and creating an atmosphere of mutual tension that gave rise to the Cold War
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh kii samaapti ke baad america tathaa soviet sangh apane apane swaarthon ko saadhane main lag gaye
 They continued to ignore each other's interests
 isse shakti raajnneeti kaa janm hua
 This made each nation an enemy of each other
 donon mahashaktiyaan apana apana prabhutv badhaane ke prayaas main antarrashtriya sangharsh kaa akhaada ban gai

 amarsingh rathod marwar rajya ke prasiddh rajput the
 He was the courtier of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan of India in the 17th century
 apane parivaar dwaara nirvasit karne ke baad wo mughalon kii seva main aaye
 His famous bravery and fighting ability resulted in him receiving royal honor and personal recognition by the emperor
 jiske baad unhen nagaur kaa subedaar banaaya gaya or baad main unhone hi yahan shashan kiya
 In his unauthorized absence in 1644, the emperor was angered by taxation and slapped Salabat Khan with a sword responsible for taking the tax
 unka varnan rajasthan, pashchimi uttar pradesh or punjab ke kuch lokgito main prasiddhi praapt he
 Raja Gaj Singh was the ruler of the Marwar region under the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan
 unke putr amar singh rathod ek mahaan yoddha or ek deshbhakt the, lekin unke pita ne unhen mughalon se ek daaku ko bachaane ke kaaran rajya se nirvasit kar diya tha
 He later joined Shah Jahan's Delhi Sultanate where he impressed Shah Jahan with his valor
 jisase unhen nagaur kaa jagirdaar banaaya gaya
 However, Salabat Khan, brother of the Emperor, was jealous of the rise of Amar Singh Rathore in the kingdom and was waiting for an opportunity to discredit Amar Singh
 unhen jald hi yah mauka mil gaya jab amar singh kii anadhikrut anupasthiti ke bare main kuch choti si chizon ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Salabat Khan raised it so much as an issue that Shah Jahan ordered the punishment of Amar Singh from Salabat
 iskaa phayda uthaate hue, salaabat ne amar singh ko dhamka kar usee vakt dand kaa bhugtan karne ko kaha
 Salabat also warned that he would not let Amar Singh go without paying the penalty
 amar singh ne apni talwaar baahar nikaali or salaabat ko maukey par maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Emperor Shah Jahan was also taken aback by the incident and ordered his troops to kill Amar Singh
 haalanki, bahadur amar ne apane yuddh kaushal ko dikhaaya or un sabhi ko maar daalaa jinhone unpar akraman kiya tha
 He quickly fled the fort and returned to a safe place
 agle din adaalat main samraat ne ghoshnaa kii ki amar singh ko maarane vaale ko jagirdaar bana diya jayega haalanki koi bhi amar singh rathore ke saath dushmani mol lene ke liye taiyaar nahin tha, kyonki unhen sirf ek din pehle hi amar singh krodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Arjun Singh, who was Amar Singh's brother-in-law, greedily accepted the challenge
 arjunasingh ne amarsingh se kaha ki shahjahan ko apni galati kaa ehsaas ho gaya he or ve amarsingh jaisaa yoddha nahin khona chahta
 Though Amar Singh did not believe in the beginning, he soon got caught in the art of betrayal of Arjun Singh
 is bich, shahjahan kii adaalat ke saamne ek chota darwaja khadaa kiya gaya tha, jisase amar singh ko adaalat main pravesh karne ke liye uske saamne jhukna padegaa
 Seeing Amar's acts first and the proceedings in court, a curious fakir asked the emperor "how can we conquer Hindustan with so many warriors" Shah Jahan said, "wait and see how we will do"
 amar samraat ke saamne jhukne ke liye taiyaar nahin tha or arjunasingh ne ye jaan liya
 He asked Amar Singh to enter first
 amar ne unki salaah maan lee, arjunasingh duusari taraf se aayaa or amar singh kii chaati main khanjar ghonp diya ,amar singh vahi par veergati ko praapt hue
 So Arjun Singh cut off his head and took it to the emperor
 raja ne fakir kii ore ishaara kiya or kaha "ab tumhen pataa he ki hamane yoddhaon se kaise chhutkaaraa dilaayaa"
 Later Shah Jahan also killed Arjun Singh
 amar singh kii mrityu kii soochna par, unki patni ,bhallu singh or ram singh ke netritv main rajput sainikon ke saath kile par hamalaa kiya jahaan amar singh kaa sharir padaa tha
 However, thousands of Mughal soldiers surrounded the Rajput forces
 bahadur rajput balon ne unhen virodh kiya jab tak amar singh ke sharir ko kile se dur nahin liya gaya
 Although all those Rajput fighters dedicated their lives to death, they never bowed down to the Mughal Sultanate
 baad main, kile main sankeern darwaja lokapriy rup se amar singh darwaja ke rup main janaa jane laga kyonki yah muslim sena ke upar rajput bahaduree kaa pratik tha
 Some historians claim that Shah Jahan ordered the door to be closed permanently as it reminded him of his defeat at the hands of Rajput forces
 lok katha main un rajput ladaakon kii prashansa main ek hridayasparshi gayan style viksit hui, jo swabhimaan ke liye lade or garv se mare
 Today, the main gate for tourists visiting Agra Fort is the Amar Singh Gate
 amar singh rathod ko asaadhaaran shakti, ichha or swatantraaa kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Neither fear, nor greed were able to influence his decision
 vah ek swatantra vyakti ke rup main amar singh rathore veergati ko praapt hue or balla champavat kii bahaduree abhi bhi rajasthan main lokgeeton or agra ke aasapaas yaad he
 a Hindi film based on Amar Singh was made in 1970, titled 'veer Amar Singh Rathod' and directed by Radhakant
 dev kumaar, kumkum or zabba rahamaan, blike and white main film ke pramukh abhinayta the
 a Gujarati film was made on the same theme and the lead role was performed by Gujarati super star Upendra Trivedi
 agra ke kile kaa ek dwaar unhen 'amar singh get' ke rup main namit kiya gaya jo agra main ek pramukh paryatak aakarshan he
