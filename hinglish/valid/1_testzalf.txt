 malik ambar kaa janm sambhavat: 1549 main ek habshi parivaar main hua
 During childhood, Khwaja Pir was taken to Baghdad market and sold to Baghdad
 khwaaja malik ambar ke saath dakshin bharat gaya jahaan use nizaamshaah pratham ke mantri changez khan ne kharid liya
 Malik Ambar's intellect was sharp, nature-oriented and generous, so it did not take long for him to gain fame than other slaves
 changez khan ke sangrakshan main rahakar nizaamshaahi raajnneeti tathaa sainik prabandh ko samajhane kaa usko avasar praapt hua
 Due to the sudden death of Genghis Khan, he stumbled around in the Nizamshahi state for some time
 nizaamshaahi rajya par kaale badalon ko aachhadit hote dekhakar tathaa dalbandi ke santaap or mughalon ke nirantar akramanon se bhaybheet hokar khyaati paane kii aashaa se vah bijapur or golkunda gaya parantu jab in rajyon main bhi yathesht suavasar praapt na hua tak vah anya habshiyon ke saath phir ahmednagar laut aayaa
 He enlisted in the army and was appointed by Amang Khan the head of 150 cavalry
 vah apane ashrayadata ke saath chunaar pahunchaa or usne mughal akramanakariyon ko pareshaan karnaa prarambh kiya
 He used to raid the enemy's camps and loot the logistics and enter his territory
 is prakaar dhire-dhire uski khyaati badhane lagi
 But when the Mughals took over Ahmednagar and the Nizamshahi state was breathing its last, Malik Ambar got an opportunity to show his indomitable courage, strength and qualities
 maraathon kii sahaayta se usne ek sena kaa nirmaan karke nizaamshaahi parivaar ke ali naam ke vyakti ko gaddi par bithakar parenda main naveen rajdhani sthapit kii
 By re-organization of the depressed state and rendering an atmosphere of peaceful peace, it created a new awakening
 nizaamshaahi rajya pun: prabhutaa tathaa aishwarya kii ore unmukh ho gaya
 The situation was favorable to him
 rajkumaar saleem ke aksmaat vidroh ke kaaran mughal sena kaa dakshin se hatana anivaary ho gaya tha
 As a result, Malik Ambar started taking control of the conquered territories by the Mughals and took Ahmednagar, almost all of the south
 parantu sheeghra hi usko ek anya kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Saadat Khan, the Nizamshahi chieftain, accepted the subjugation of the Mughals
 yah dekhakar uske ek anudhar raju ne uske adhikrut pradesh par apana adhikaar jamaa liya or usne mughalon se takkar lenaa prarambh kar diya
 He too came to Penda but joined other Nizamshahi servants
 parantu aashajanak pad na paane ke kaaran cruddh hokar vah apane pradesh ko waapas chalaa gaya or vahaan se nizaamshaah ko ambar ke viruddh bhadakaana prarambh kiya
 As a result, both Amber and Raju became enemies of each other
 lekin apane kshetron main donon mughalon kaa muqabla karte rahe
 Despite this, by 1605 Malik Ambar's situation only became firm
 mughalon kii sampurna ahmednagar rajya se nikaalkar usne parenda ko chhod diya or junnar main nai rajdhani banaai
 After defeating Raju, he took him captive and then put him to death, and also took control of his estate
 mughalon se takkar lete lete usne khanekhana ko lohe ke chane chabava die
 Jahangir was enraged at the failure of his army chief Khankhana and Khankhana was summoned to the court to find out the reason
 agra pahunchakar khanekhana ne visham paristhiti kaa byoraa diya, atev malik ambar kii badhati hui satta kaa daman karne ke abhipraay se vah pun: dakshin bheja gaya
 Now Malik Ambar took help from Bijapur and Golconda and broke down on the Mughals
 usne khanekhana kii yojana ko asafal kar diya
 Forced, the emperor sent the prince and Asaf Khan with a large army to the south, but he too had no success
 malik ambar kii shakti din-prati-din badhati gai or 1610 main samasya itani gambhir ho gai ki asaf khan ne samrat se anurodh kiya ki vah swayan hi padhaaren
 Jahangir considered this suggestion and thought of going south but the other rich people did not support it
 ab dakshin kii samasya ke hal kaa uttardaayitv khaanejahaan ko saunpa gaya
 But before he reached there, Khankhana, with the help of his sons, planned a sudden attack on Malik Ambar and attacked him
 malik ambar to taiyaar hi baitha tha
 He got rid of the sixes of the Mughals and forced Khankhana to return to Burhanpur
 usko ek sandhi par hastakshar bhi karne pade
 Subsequently, Malik Ambar took control over the neighboring areas of Ahmednagar and surrounded his fort and took it away
 baraar or vaalakaat ke kuch bhaagon ko chhodkar lagbhag sampurna nizaamshaahi rajya, jisapar mughalon ne 1600-1601 main apana adhikaar jamaa liya tha, ab malik ambar ne unke haathon se chin liya or nizaamshaahi vansh ke rajya ko punerjeevan pradaan kiya
 Khanjahan Lodi reached the state and tried to get acquainted with the atmosphere there
 usne samrat ko yah suzav diya ki khanekhana ko hataakar senapati pad kaa bhaar usko hi saunpa jaae
 He promised that if his proposal was accepted, he would establish Mughal authority over the states of Ahmednagar and Bijapur within two years
 jahangir ne uski baaten maan leen or use prachur dhan or sena di
 Nevertheless, when he landed in the ground against Malik Ambar, it seemed to him that although the enemy's sword is not heavier than his sword, his manner of fighting is certainly unique
 kehane kaa taatpary yah ki use bhi malik ambar ke saamne jhukna padaa or uskaa garv chur chur ho gaya
 With the intention of defeating Malik Ambar, the emperor devised a grand plan which aimed to simultaneously attack Malik Ambar from three directions and simultaneously destroy Malik Ambar and destroy his power
 parantu yah yojana bhi asafal siddh hui or shahi sena astavyast hokar bhaag khadi hui
 The Khankhana was then sent to the southern region to regain lost prestige
 vah vahaan 1612 i main pahunchaa
 It was his good fortune that at this time there was internal division in the court of Nizamshah
 is paristhiti se labhanvit hokar usne anek dakshini saradaaron ko ghoose dekar apane paksh main kar liya
 Although Malik Ambar had the support of Bijapur and Golconda, he also did nothing in front of diplomacy and the strong army
 1616 i ke yuddh main use haar khaani padi
 The victors destroyed and corrupted Kirkee
 yadhyapi khanekhana ne mughal pratishtha ko ek seemaa tak phir se sthapit kar diya tha, parantu usapar ghoosekhori ke aarope lagate hi rahe
 That is why the emperor sent Prince Khurram with a huge army to the south
 rajkumaar ke aagaman se dakshini rajyon main khalabali much gai
 Soon the kings of Bijapur and Golconda signed a treaty with the Mughals
 aisi dasha main jabaki malik ambar mitraheen ho gaya, uske samaksh sar jhukaane ke atirikt koi anya upaay nahin rah gaya
 Hence, he handed over the area of balaghat and the fort of Ahmednagar to the Mughals and thus saved the Nizamshahi state from being lost
 agle do varshon tak vah chupchaap apane sadhano ko jutaney main laga rahaa
 Here a fierce fire of envy spread in the Mughal army
 at: malik ambar ne pun: golkunda or bijapur ko milakar mughal virdohi sangh sthapit kar liya
 He broke into the Mughal occupied territories in violation of the provisions of the treaty two years ago and in a short period of three months he took over most of Mughalai Ahmednagar and Berar
 usne na keval balapur ko lutaa hi balki usapar gheraa bhi daalaa
 Continuously attacking the Mughal forces retreating towards Burhanpur, he advanced to Burhanpur
 nagar ke baahar gheraa daalaa or nikatavarti pradesh ko khub lutaa
 Not only this, he also raided Mandu by entering Malwa
 isse narmada ke uttar or dakshin kshetron main mughalon kii khyaati ko bahut dhakka laga
 Seeing the situation becoming increasingly serious, the Khankhana pleaded for military assistance repeatedly
 samrat ne rajkumaar shahjahan ko yah aadesh diya vah sena sahit dakshin ko prasthaan kare
 As soon as he reached there, the atmosphere began to change quickly
 uski sena aandhi ke samaan shatru ke desh par aachhadit ho gai
 The Marathas fled from Mandu and the enemy had to evacuate the fortification of Burhanpur
 mughalon ne ab kirki par dhaava bol diya
 Possibly Nizamshah, along with his family, would have fallen to the invaders but Malik Ambar sent them to Daulatabad
 kirki se chalakar mughal sena ahmednagar pahaunchi or usko ghere se mukt kiya
 Malik Ambar was watching his unfortunate activity from the fort of Daulatabad
 kuch vipareet paristhitiyon ke kaaran shahjahan is yuddh ko aage badhanaa nahin chahta tha
 Therefore he thought it appropriate to make a treaty
 malik ambar ne us samast kshetra ko waapas kar diya jo usne gat do varshon main mughalon se chin liya tha
 In addition, 14 Kos were given adjacent land
 teenon dakshini riyasaton ne 50 lakh rupaya kar ke rup main dene kaa vachan diya 20 lakh golkunda ne or shesh 12 lakh ahmednagar ne
 In this way, Malik Ambar, with great tact, retrieved the Nizamshahi kingdom from the mouth of Kaal
 parantu uski vipattiyon kaa ant na hua
 Still his courage did not decrease
 shahjahan ne apane pita ke prati vidroh karke mughal samrajya main raajnneetik bukamp paidaa kar diya
 Therefore, when defeated in the north, he reached South Pradesh and requested help from Malik Ambar, Malik Ambar refused to fear the emperor's rivalry
 parantu iske peeche niti bhi thi
 There was a fight between Nizamshah and Adilshah over Solapur
 usamen usko mughalon kii sahanubhuti praapt karne kii aashaa thi
 Therefore, when Mahavat Khan reached Shahjahan in South Pradesh, both Adilshah and Malik Ambar pleaded for Mughal help
 kuch samay tak to mahavat khan ne donon ko dwividha main rakhaa, parantu tab shahjahan bengal kii ore bhaag gaya tab mughal senapati ne adilshaah ko sahaayta dene kaa vachan diya
 But soon he had to go towards Bengal
 is suavasar se malik ambar ne puraa laabh uthaaya
 He sent the Nizamshah family to Daulatabad for protection and along with the army himself advanced towards the border of Golconda
 qutubashah se dhan lekar sandhi karke vah adilshahi pradesh par tut padaa
 By taking possession of the desired places, he started marching towards Bijapur, plundering
 adilshaah ne mughalon se sahaayta maangi
 In the battle of Bhatwadi, the Mughal Adilshahi army faced Malik Ambar
 parantu 15 june 1625 ko malik ambar ne unhen buree tarah haraaya
 This success increased his fame and fame
 ab vah kushal senapati, raajnneetijna or prabandhakarta samajha jane laga
 His courage and means also progressed
 falswaroop ahmednagar va sholapur par usne phir se apana aadhipaty jamaa liya or uske senapati, yakuut khan ne burhanpur ke kile par gheraa daal diya
 At the same time, Mahavat Khan, chasing Shah Jahan, again came south
 yakuut khan ne burhanpur se apni sena hataa lee
 Malik Ambar did not hesitate to give protection to Shah Jahan this time
 donon sanyukt senaaon ne burhanpur par gheraa daalaa, parantu koi safalataa praapt na hui
 After a while Shah Jahan surrendered and surrendered
 aisi paristhiti main malik ambar ke liye mughalon kaa saamana karnaa kathin tha
 Therefore, he removed the army from the fort of Burhanpur
 agle varsh use mughalon se takkar lene kaa avasar praapt hua
 At this time Jahangir was ill
 noorjehan kii gutbandi ne mahavat khan ko vidroh karne par vivash kar diya tha, tathaa sampurna shahi senaayen mahavat khan kaa vidroh daman karne main lagi hui thim
 There was no skilled commander left in the south
 isse pehle ki vah apni senaaon kii gatividhi mughalon ke viruddh yaa adilshaah ke viruddh sanchalit kare, mrityu ne uski ankhen may 14, 1615 ko assi varsh kii aayu main band kar deen
 From 1601 to 1626, Malik Ambar showed his talent, indomitable courage, efficiency and military tact
 bhartiya itihaas main aisa birla hi udhaaharan milegaa jab kisi ujde hue rajya ko ek saadhaaran shrenee ke vyakti ne navajivan pradaan kiya ho
 Malik Ambar's talent was versatile
 vah suyogy senapati to tha hi, iske saath saath kushal nitijna or chatur shaasha bhi tha
 He invented a new military system by properly evaluating the military attitude of the Marathas
 todermal kii bhoomikar vyavastha ko apane rajya main prachlan karke usne na keval rikt kosh ko hi samridhishalee banaaya balki janata ko bhi sukh pradaan kiya
 He settled his capital in Kirkee and built many mosques, palaces and gardens here
 sinchai ke liye naharen bhi khudwain
 The Mahawal Pass, Darwaja Nakhuda Mahal, Kala Chabutra diwan-i-aam and diwan-i-khas, which today appear as ruins attest to his sentiments

 But it should be remembered that many geographers in India had discovered important laws of geometry even before the great Greek geologist Euclid, among those geographers, the name of Baudhayana is paramount

 In other words, it describes the method of deriving a square root of 2

 The term modernism generally refers to the post-traditional, post-medieval historical period, marked by a move from feudalism to capitalism, industrialization, secularism, rationalization, the nation-state and its constituent institutions and types of surveillance
 On the basis of the concept, modernity is concerned with the modern era and modernity, but it forms a specific concept
 jabaki inlitenment, pashchimi darshan main ek vishisht andolan kii ore ishaara karata he, aadhuniktaa keval poonjeevaad ke udai ke saath sambandhit saamaajik judaav ko sanderbhit karti he
 Modernity can also refer to the tendencies of intellectual culture, particularly those movements that are associated with secularization and post-industrial life, such as the formal establishment of Marxism, existentialism, and social science
 In this context, modernism has been associated with cultural and intellectual movements of 1436–1789 that extend back to the 1970s or beyond
 yah bahut si sahi kaha gaya hai ki "aadhunikeekaran puraani prakriya ke liye chaalu shabd hai
 yah saamaajik parivartan kii vah prakriya hai jisase kaam viksit samaaj viksit samajo kii saamaanya visheshetaon ko praapt karte hai" The use of the English word "modern" dates back to the 5th century, originally referring to the separation of the Christian era from the pagan era, yet the term's common usage began in the 17th century only, which is the Quarrel of Was derived from The Ancient and the Moderns - arguing that: "is modern culture better than classical culture?" - And this debate was a literary and artistic dispute between the Academia Français in the early 1690s
 in prayogon ke anusaar, "aadhuniktaa" kaa taatpary tha haal ke ateet kaa tyaag karnaa, ek nai shuruyaat kaa paksh lenaa or aitihaasik mul kii punarvyakhya karnaa
 Furthermore, the difference between "modernism" and "modern" did not emerge until the 19th century
 marshall burman kii ek pustak ke anusaar aadhuniktaa ko teen paaramparik charnon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he : Writers such as Lyotard and Baudrillard believe that modernity ended in the mid or late 20th century and thus the period after modernity is described as post-modernism
 anya siddhantkaron ne, baharhaal 20 veen sadi ke ant se lekar vartmaan samay kii avadhi ko aadhuniktaa kaa hi ek anya charan mana he; is charan ko bouman dwaara "taral" aadhuniktaa yaa gidence dwaara "ucch" aadhuniktaa kaha jaataa he 
 Politically, the initial phase of modernism begins with the work of Niccol मेक Maciévili in which the openly rejected analysis of politics from the medieval and Aristotle style gives a comparative view on how things should be and Instead, realistic analysis favored what things actually are
 unhone yah bhi prastaav kiya ki raajnneeti kaa uddeshy he apane maukon yaa bhagya ko niyantrit karnaa or doordarshita par bharosa karnaa vastav main buraai kii ore le jaataa he
 For example, Makeiwali has argued that violent divisions within the political community are unavoidable, but it can also be a source of power that lawmakers and leaders must rely on and in some ways encourage
 mekiawali kii siforeeshon ne kabhi-kabhi raajaaon or rajkumaron par apana prabhaav daalaa, lekin antat ise rajtantr ke bajaaye swatantra ganraajyon kaa paksh lene ke rup main dekha jane laga
 In return, macivelli influenced Francis Bacon, Merchantmont Needham, Herrington, John Milton, David Hume, and many others
 mahatvapurn aadhunik raajnneetik siddhant jo naveen mekiyeveli yatharthwaad se utpann hue hai unamem shaamil he mendeville kaa prabhaavshaalee prastaav ki "ek kushal rajaneta ke nipun prabandhan dwaara nijee dhoortta ko naagarik laabh main badla ja saktaa he" or sarkaar main "shakti kaa sanvaidhanik vibhaajan", jise sarvapratham spasht rup se montescu dwaara prastaavit kiya gaya tha
 Both these principles are included in the constitution of most modern democracies
 yah dekha gaya he ki jabaki mekiawali ke yatharthwaad kaa mulya yuddh or raajnneetik hinsa main dekha gaya, uske sthaayee prabhaav ko "niyantrit" kiya gaya taaki upyogi sangharsh ko jaanboojh kar jitna sambhav ho aupchaarik raajnneetik sangharsh main parivartit kiya jaae or aarthik "sangharsh" ko mukt, nijee udhyamon ke bich protsaahit kiya jaae 
 Starting with Thomas Hobbes, such efforts were made so that the methods of modern physics proposed by Bacon and Dekart could be used and applied to humanity and politics
 Notable efforts to develop Hobbes's methodology approach include Locke, Spinoza, Giambattista Vico and Russo
 David Hume first tried to apply Bacon's scientific method to political subjects and rejected some of the aspects of Hobbes's approach in this effort
 aadhuniktaavaadi ganatantrwaad ne dach vidroh, angreji grih yuddh, america kranti or francisi kranti ke dauraan ganatantr kii sthapana ko khule taur par prabhavit kiya
 a second phase of modernist political thinking begins with Rousseau, who questioned humanity's natural rationality and sociality and established that human nature is more flexible than it was previously thought
 is tark ke aadhaar par jo chiz ek acchhee raajnneetik vyavastha yaa ek achche aadmi kaa nirmaan karti he vah puri tarah se us sanjog maarg par nirbhar he jiskaa anugaman logon ne puure itihaas ke dauraan kiya he
 This idea influenced the political thinking of Emmanuel Kant, Edmund Burke, and others, and prompted a critical review of modernist politics
 roodhiwaadee paksh par, bark ne tark diya ki is samaj ne satarkta or krantikari parivartan se bachaav ko protsaahit kiya
 While this thinking also inspired more ambitious movements in human culture, initially Romanticism and Historicism and finally Karl Marx's communism and modern forms of nationalism inspired by the French Revolution, which included the German Nazi movement in its extreme form

 In the most basic context, Anthony Giddens describes modernity as 


 aadhunik samaaj, yaa audyogic sabhyataa ke liye ek ashulipi shabd
 adhik vistaar main chitrit kiye jane par, iskaa sambhddha vishwa ke prati ek khaas drushtikon se he, aise vishwa kaa vichaar rakhana jo parivartan ke liye taiyaar he, maanav hastkshep dwaara; aarthik sansthaanon, vishesh rup se audyogic utpaadan or ek bazaar arthvyavastha kaa parisar; raajnneetik sansthaaon kii ek nishchit shrinkhalaa, jisamen shaamil he raashtra-rajya or jan loktantr
 mote taur par in visheshtaon ke parinaam ke rup main, aadhuniktaa kisi purv saamaajik vyavastha kii tulana main adhik gatisheel he
 It is a society - more technically a complex of institutions - that, unlike any previous culture, lives in the future rather than in the past
 aadhuniktaa "ek pragatisheel bal kii ore nirdeshit he jo maanav jati ko agyanta or tarkheenata se mukt karaane kaa vaada karti he"

 nischitata kii is haani ke kendra main dharm kii haani he
 Various 19th-century intellectuals, including August Comte and Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud, tried to introduce scientific and / or political ideologies in the wake of secularization
 Modernism can be described as the "age of ideology"
 theodor adorno or zigamunt bauman jaise siddhantkaron ne prastaavit kiya ki aadhuniktaa inlitenment ke kendriya tatwon se prasthaan kaa pratinidhitiv karti he or yah algaav bhaavana kii napak prakriyaaon, jaise ki vastu prem or holokast kii ore badhati he

 Rationalization processes - such as development for the sake of development - can in many cases have a negative and inhumane effect on modern society

 In the 14th century, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and others developed a new approach to physics and astronomy that changed the way people think
 Copernicus introduced new models of the solar system that no longer house mankind's home earth
 Kepler used mathematics to discuss physics and described nature's regularities as such
 galileo ne ganit kaa prayog karte hue mukt giraav main samaan twaran kaa saboot pesh kiya
 Francis Bacon specifically called for a new experimentally based approach to science in his Novum Orghenam, which did not emphasize the need for knowledge of formal or ultimate causes and was therefore materialistic, much like the ancient philosophy of Democritus and Epicurus
 lekin usne ek vishay yah bhi joda ki vigyaan ko maanavtaa kii khatir prakruti ko niyantrit karne kii koshish kerani chahie or ise sirf samajhane ke liye nahin samajha janaa chahie
 In the context of both these things, he was influenced by Makeyewali's earlier criticism of medieval classical orthodoxy and his proposal that leaders should control their own destiny
 galileo kii nai bhautikee or bekan, donon se prabhavit hote hue, rene dekart ne sheeghra hi tark diya ki ganit or jyamiti ne aisa model pradaan kiya he ki vaigyanik gyaan ko kaise chote charnon main banaaya ja saktaa he
 He also openly argued that a human being can be understood as a complex machine in itself
 ijac newton ne dekart se prabhavit hote hue or bekan kii hi tarah prayogtmak kadam kaa chunaav karte hue theth udhaaharan pradaan kiya ki kaise ek taraf kaatizian ganit, jyamiti or saidhantik nigaman or duusari taraf bakonian prayogtmak avlokan or aagaman, ek saath milakar prakruti kii niyamittaaon kii vaastavik samaj main badi sahaayta kar sakate hai 
 Modernist political thinking was already widely known in France, as Russo's re-examination of human nature resulted in a renewed critique of the value of reasoning itself, which in turn led to less rational human activities, particularly From the look of art
 Its initial impact was on the movements of what we know as German idealism and Romanticism in the 18th and 19th centuries
 aadhunik kala isliye aadhuniktaa ke baad ke charnon main hi maani jaati he
 The history of art, for this reason, sees "modernity" as distinct from the term modern age and modernism - it sees it as a "discrete" term used for the cultural state in which the manifestation of innovation The absolute necessity becomes a primary condition of life, work and thoughts "
 And modernity in art is "more than a state of being modern, or more than a conflict between old and new"
 "da painter of modern life" niabandh main charles baudlair ek shabdic paribhaasha dete hai: "aadhuniktaa se meraa matlab he kshanbhangur, bhagoda, aakasmik" 
 Among the conceptual definitions available in sociology, modernity is defined by "the 'proof' marked by the obsession of visual culture and personal visibility"
 In general, the large-scale social integration that constitutes modernity involves: hindi kavi or lekhak Amritam Kurisina Raat is a collection of poems composed by renowned Telugu linguist D
 Balagangadhar Tilak for which he was posthumously awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for Telugu language in 1970
