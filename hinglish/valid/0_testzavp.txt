 Theoretically, this limit should be around the Planck mass, where it is expected that quantum effects would prove the theory of general relativity to be false
 is kaaran prithvi yaa uske aas paas blike hole ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko bilkul nakaara ja saktaa he
 However, some developments in quantum gravity suggest that the limit of this bond may be considerably lower
 udahaaran ke liye, kuch brinworld paridrishy plank dravyaman ko kaaphi neeche rakhte hai, shaayad 1 tev / c2 itnaa neeche tak
 This may allow the creation of microscopic black holes in high-energy collisions or large Hadron colliders of the CERN
 haalaanki ye saare siddhant kaaphi kaalpanik hai or kai vaigyaniko kaa mat he ki in prakriyaaon main blike hole kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he
 Black holes, once formed, continue to develop by absorption of additional substances

 More significant contributions occur when a black hole is formed in a binary star system
 nirmaan ke baad blike hole apane saathi se kaaphi maatra main padaarth avashoshit kar saktaa he
 Extremely large contributions occur when a black hole merges with other stars or compact objects

 The same process has also been proposed to form some intermediate-mass black holes

 Shortly thereafter, the expansion of the radius is evenly distributed throughout the hole
 1974 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki blike hole puri tarah se kaale nahin hai, balki ye thodi maatra main tapiya vikiran bhi nikaalte hai
 They found this result using quantum field theory in a stable black hole background
 unke samikarnon kaa parinaam yah he ki ek blike hole ko kanon ko ek adarsh blike body spectrum main chhodana chahie
 This effect became known as Hawking radiation
 hawking parinaam ke baad se, kaiyon nen vibhinn tareekon ke madhyam se is prabhaav ko satyapit kiya he
 If this theory of black hole radiation is correct, then it is expected that the black holes will remove the thermal beam of radiation and this will cause the mass to decay, since according to the theory of relativity, the mass is just the high condensed energy
 Over time, black holes will shrink and fly in the air
 is kiranpunj kaa taapmaana blike hole ke satahi gurutvkarshanake anupatik rahata he, jo badale main dravyaman ke liye vipareet rup main anupaatik rahata he
 Hence larger black holes emit less radiation than smaller black holes
 5 saura drabyaman vaale ek taarakeey blike hole kaa hawking taapmaana kareeb 12 nanokelvins hota he
 This is much lower than the 2
7K produced by the space micro-wave background
 taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike hole hawking vikiran ke madhyam se jitna drabyaman chhodte hai usase adhik dravyaman ve cosmik microwave prishthbhumi se praapt kar lete hai, atah ve sikudne kii bajaay failte jate hai
 To achieve Hawking temperatures higher than 2
7 K, a black hole would have to be lighter than the Moon
 duusari taraf yadi ek blike hole bahut chota he, ummid kii jaati he ki uskaa vikiran kaa prabhaav bahut shaktishaalee ho jaayegaa
 a black hole that is even heavier than humans will vanish in a moment
 ek car ke vajan vaala blike hole ko vashpit hone ke liye maatr ek nanosecond kaa samay hi lagegaa, is dauraan kuch kshanon ke liye isaki chamak surya se 200 guna se bhi adhik ho jaayegi
 Light black holes are expected to evaporate even faster, for example a black hole with 1 tev / c 2 mass will take less than 10–88 seconds to completely disappear
 beshak, itane chote blike hole ke liye kwantum gurutv prabhaav se ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii ummid kii jaati he or yahan tak ki – haalaanki kwantum gurutv main hue haal ke vikaas is ore koi sanket nahin karte hai – parikaalpanik taur par aise chote blike hole sthir honge
 The presence of most accretion disks and gas jets is not a clear evidence of the presence of stellar mass black holes, as other more massless and very dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs can cause and create accretion disks and gas currents
 The behavior is the same as that around a black hole
 lekin ve aksar khagolavidon kii yah batalaakar madad kar sakati hai ki kis jagah blike hole kii talash faldaayi siddh ho sakati he
 But on the other hand, supermassive accretion disks and gas currents can be a good proof of the presence of a highly soluble black hole, because as far as we know, only one black hole can be the cause of these phenomena
 sthir eks-re or gamma kiran utsarjan bhi kisi blike hole kii maujuudagi sabit nahin karte hai, lekin khagolavidon ko yah bataa sakate hai ki kahan khoj karnaa faldaayi hoga- or inaki ye khubi hoti he ki ve kaaphi aasaani se nabulai or gas ke badalon se nikal pate hai
 But powerful, irregular X-rays, gamma rays and other electromagnetic radiation can help prove that that massive, super-dense object is not a black hole, so that the "black hole hunter" is focused on another object Can do
 neutron taron or anya ati saghan taron par satahen hoti hai or padaarthon kaa prakaash kii gati ke ek ucch pratishat par sataha ke saath takaraav, aniyamit antaraalon par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa utsarjan karata he
 The black hole has no solid surface, so the absence of intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals around a very densely compact object indicates that there may be a good chance of a black hole
 gahan parantu ek hi baar gamma kiran kaa nikalnaa kisi "nae" blike hole ke janm kaa sanket ho saktaa he, kyonki khagol-bhautikavidon kaa vichaar he ki grbs kaa kaaran yaa to kisi vishaal taare kaa gurutveey patan he athwa neutron taron ke bich takaraav, or in donon ghatnaon main blike hole kaa srijan karne hetu paryaapt drabyaman or dabaav shaamil hota he
 But it appears that a collision between a neutron star and a black hole can also produce a GRB, so a GRB is not evidence that a "new" black hole has formed
 sabhi gyaat GRB hamaari apni akashganga ke baahar se aate hai or adhikansh arabon prakaash varshon kii dur se aate hai isliye inase jude blike hole vastav main arabon varsh puraane hai
 Some space-physicists believe that some super bright X-ray sources may be the accretion disks of intermediate-mass black holes
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kasaar atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii abhivruddhi discs hai, kyonki ab tak gyaat koi bhi vastu itani shaktishaalee nahin he jo itnaa shaktishaalee utsarzan kar sake
 Quasars produce powerful emissions throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, including UV, X-rays and gamma-rays, and are also visible from a considerable distance due to their high brightness
 5 se 25 pratishat ke bich kasaar "radio laud" hote hai, yah sangya inke shaktishaalee radio utsarjan ke kaaran he
 a gravitational lens is formed when rays of light coming from a far away bright source are "twisted" around a giant object, between the viewer and the source object
 This process is known as gravitational lensing and is one of the predictions of general relativity theory
 is siddhant ke anusaar, drabyaman gurutvkarshan kshetron ko banane ke liye antariksh-samay ko "samete" rahata he or isliye parinamswaroop prakaash ko mode detaa he
 The image of the source behind the lens can appear to an observer as multiple images
 yadi strot, baari lencing vastu or paryvekshak ek sidhi rekha main hon, strot baari vastu ke peeche ek challe ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 Gravitational lensing can also be caused by objects other than black holes, because any very powerful gravitational field has the ability to bend light rays
 in bahu chhaviyon vaale prabhaavon main se kuch, sambhawatah sudur sthit akashgangaon ke kaaran nirmit hote hai
 Objects orbiting a black hole continue to explore the gravitational field surrounding the central object

 Although the matter itself cannot be seen directly, the flickering of the x-ray continues in milliseconds, as expected just before accretion from a hot mass-like material orbiting around a black hole of about ten solar masses

 Nothing is visible in the center of the supervised orbit, as would be expected from a black object
 ardh-aavadhik dolan kaa istamaal blike hole ke dravyaman kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 This technique uses the relationship between the black hole and the inner part of its surrounding disks, where the gas continues to rotate inward before reaching the event horizon

 This indicator is called half-period oscillation or QPO

 For black holes with greater mass, the event horizon is farther outward, so the QPO frequency is lower
 ab yah vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki prayek akashganga ke, yaa lagbhag prayek, centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole hota he
 The close correlation between the mass of this black hole and the rise of the host galaxy indicates that there is a deep correlation between the formation of the galaxy and the black hole
 dashakon tak, khagolavidon ne "sakriy akashganga" shabd kaa istemaal aisi akashgangaon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jinamein asaamaanya visheshtaayen hoti thi, jaise ki asaamaanya varnakrameey rekha utsarjan or ati shaktishaalee radio utsarjan
 However, theoretical and observational studies show that the galactic nuclei active in these galaxies may contain supermassive black holes
 in AGN ke modelon main ek kendriya blike hole hota he jo ki suraj se lakhon yaa arabon guna adhik baari ho saktaa he; ek gas or dhul kii discs jise abhivruddhi discs kehete hai; or do dharaaen jo abhivruddhi discs ke lambavat hoti hai
 Although it is expected that supermassive black holes will be found in almost all agns, the nuclei of only a few galaxies have been carefully studied in an effort to both identify and measure the actual mass of central supermassive black hole candidates
 Can be done
 aisi kuch ullekhneey akashgangaon ke udhaaharan hai, andromeda akashganga, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, or sombrero akashganga
 Astronomers believe that a supermassive black hole is located in the center of our own galaxy, in an area called Segitarius a *, because: 2002 main, habbal antarikshawya doorabeen ne jo avlokan prastut kiya ve sanket karte hai ki M15 or G1 naamak golakaar samoohon main madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole ke hone kii sambhaavna he
 This interpretation is based on the size and duration of the orbit of stars in spherical clusters
 lekin habbal saboot nirnaayak nahin he, kyonki neutron taron kaa ek samooh is tarah ke avlokanon kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Until recent discoveries, many astronomers thought that complex gravitational interactions in spherical clusters would expel newly formed black holes
 november 2004 main, khagolavidon kii ek team ne hamaari akashganga ke pratham or purnatah satyapit madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, jo segiterius A* se 3 prakaash varsh dur parikrama kar rahaa he
 This black hole, with a mass of 1300 solar masses, is in the middle of a group of seven stars, possibly a remnant of a massive star cluster that has fallen from the center of the Ganges
 yah avlokan is baat kii pushti karata he ki ati vishalkay blike hole aasapaas ke chote blike holon or taron ke avasorana dwaara apni vruddhi karte he
 In January 2007, researchers at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom reported the discovery of a black hole, possibly containing 10 solar masses and located in a galaxy called NGC 4472, at a distance of about 55 million light years
 hamaari akashganga main kai sambhavit taarakeey-dravyaman vaale blike hole shaamil hai, jo sagiterius A* kshetra ke ati vishalkay blike hole kii tulana main hamase adhik najadik hai
 All of these candidates are members of X-ray binary systems in which a more dense object draws substances from its partner through an accretion disk
 in jodon main blike hole teen se lekar ek darjan se zyada saura dravyamanon ke ho sakate hai
 The hitherto observable stellar mass black hole, Messia is a member of the binary system located in 33 galaxies

 Once they are created, they have the properties of black holes
 stephen hawking ne pratipaadit kiya ki atipraarambhik blike hole vashpit ho kar or bhi sookshm ho sakate hai, arthath sookshm blike hole
 The Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope is being proposed for the discovery of a supermassive black hole that evaporates, which was launched on 11 June 2008
 haalaanki, agar sookshm blike hole kaa nirmaan duusare tareekon se ho saktaa he, jaise ki antarikshawya kiran ke prabhaav se yaa coliders main, iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki unhen nishchit rup se vashpit ho janaa chahie
 The formation of analogs of black holes in particle accelerators on Earth is reported

 saamaanya saapekshata main aise vinyas kii sambhaavna kaa varnan kiya gaya he jisamen do blike hole ek duusare se jude hue hai
 Such a configuration is usually called a wormhole
 varmholon ne kalpit vigyaan kathaon ke lekhakon ko prerit kiya he kyonki ve ati lambi duuri kii yatraaon ko shighrata se tay karne kaa saadhan pradaan karte hai, time travel bhi
 In practice, such configurations are almost impossible in astrophysics, as no known process seems to allow the creation of these objects
 1971 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki paaramparik blike hole ke kisi bhi sangrah ke ghatana kshitij ke kul kshetra ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, bhale hi ve aapas main takaraa kar ek duusare ko nigal len, arthath vilay ho jaae
 This is remarkably similar to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, where the field plays the role of entropy
 aisa mana jaataa tha ki shunya taapmaana hone kii vajah se blike hole kii entropy shunya hogi
 If this were the case, the entry of entropy-rich matter into the black hole would have violated the second law of thermodynamics, resulting in a decrease in the total entropy of the universe
 isliye, jacob bekensten ne prastaav rakhaa ki ek blike hole kii ek entropy chahie or ise ghatana kshitij kaa anupaatik hona chahie
 Since black holes traditionally do not emit radiation, the thermodynamic approach seems to be consistent, as zero temperature means infinite changes in entropy by any sum of heat, which means infinite entropy
 haalaanki, 1974 main, hawking ne ghatana kshitij ke paas pramaatra kshetra siddhant ko vakrit antariksh-samay par lagu kiya or paaya ki blike hole hawking vikiran chhodte hai, jo ek tarah kaa tapiya vikiran he or unru prabhaav se sambaddh he, jiskaa arth yah niklaa ki unamem ek saakaratmak taapmaana nihit he
 This reinforced the simulation between black hole dynamics and thermodynamics: using the first law of black hole mechanics, it can be concluded that the entropy of a non-rotating black hole will be one-fourth of the area of its event horizon 
 yah ek saarvbhaumik parinaam he or ise sampoorn brahmadia kshitij par lagu kiya ja saktaa he, jaise kii di citter antariksh kshetra main
 Later it was suggested that a black hole is an object with maximum entropy, that is, the maximum possible entropy of a single region of space would be the entropy of the largest black hole that can be contained in that region
 isaki vajah se holographic siddhant kii utpatti hui
 Hawking radiation refers to the specific temperature of a black hole, which can be calculated from its entropy
 taapmaana jitna giregaa, blike hole utana hi vishaal hota jaayegaa: jitani adhik urja avashoshit karegaa, utana hi adhik adhik thanda hota jaayegaa
 a black hole with approximately the mass of the planet Mercury has a temperature in equilibrium with celestial micro-wave radiation
 isse adhik baari hone par, ek blike hole prishthbhumi vikiran se adhik thanda ho jayega or yah hawking vikiran ke madhyam se utsarjit urja kii tulana main, prishthbhumi se zyada teji se urja praapt karegaa, isse bhi adhik thanda ho jaayegaa
 However, in a less massive black hole this effect would indicate that the mass of the black hole evaporates slowly over time, while the black hole will continue to heat up while doing so
 haalaanki ye prabhaav un blike hole ke liye naganya hai jo antarikshawya rup se gathit hone ke liye paryaapt rup se baari hai, ve kaalpanik chote blike hole ke liye badi teji se mahatvapurn ho jaayenge, jahaan pramaatra-yantric prabhaav haaavee hon
 In fact, small black holes will probably evaporate at a rapid rate and eventually disappear with an explosion of radiation
 haalanki saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog kisi blike hole kii entropy kii gananaa hetu kiya ja saktaa he, yah sthiti siddhanthata santushti dene vaala nahin he
 In statistical mechanics, entropy is understood as the calculation of the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have similar microscopic properties
 lekin ek pramaatra gurutv ke santoshjanak siddhant ke bina, blike hole ke liye is prakaar kii gananaa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 However, little hope has been aroused by string theory, according to which the microscopic amount of freedom of a black hole is D-branes
 pradaan kiye gayi charge or urja dwaara di-brans kii avasthaaon kii gananaa karke, kuch khaas ati samamit blike hole ke utkram maap ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he

 It is necessary to emphasize that the equations of general relativity do in fact follow t-symmetry and that the fact that the above argument comes from the application of general relativity should be a bit cautious
 yah is tathy kii vajah se he ki time-cymetric siddhant dwaara time-reversal-acemmetric nishkarsh tak pahunchaana sambhav nahin he, jo is maamle main saamaanya saapekshata he
 Rindler coordinates, which are applied near the event horizon for an external viewer, are T-symmetric, so the existence of something like an "invariant" process can be ruled out
 yah sambhav he ki "virodhabhas" time-samamit siddhant par time-asamamit seemaa ko lagu karne kaa parinaam he, yah isko loshmit virodhabhas kaa ek prakaar banataa he
 Considerations of quantum gravity, on the other hand, suggest that there may only be a finite finite inverse measurement that will be related to the space near the horizon: but the change in the horizon's entropy and the Hawking radiation's entropy measure are sufficient Happens to contain all the transverse measurements of matter and energy that are falling into a black hole
 haalaanki kai bhautikeevidon kii yah chintaa he ki yah abhi bhi thik prakaar se samajha nahin ja sakaa he
 In particular, at a quantum level, the quantum state of Hawking radiation is determined only by what has previously fallen into the black hole; And the history of what had fallen into a black hole is determined solely by the quantum state of black hole and radiation
 yahi niyatatvvaad or kendrikaran kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 For a long time Stephen Hawking defied the idea, insisting on his original 1975 position that Hawking radiation is completely thermal, therefore completely disorganized, with no information of the material previously ingested by the black hole
 ; He argued that this information has been omitted
 haalaanki, 21 july 2004 main, unhone nayaa tark prastut kiya, apane pichley tark ke vipareet
 In this new calculation, the entropy measurement corresponding to the black hole passes out to the Hawking radiation
 haalaanki, ise siddhant main samaj paanaa bhi mushkil he, jab tak blike hole apana vashpikaran puraa na kar le
 Until then, it is impossible to establish a 1: 1 approach to Hawking radiation information and the initial state of the system
 ek baar jab blike hole puri tarah vashpit ho jaye, unki pahchaan kii ja sakati he or unamem hua kendrikaran sangrakshit rahata he
 By the time Hawking completed his calculations, it was quite clear by the ads / CFT relationship that black holes decay in a unitary way
 kyonki gej siddhanton main aag ke gole, jo hawking vikiran ke anuroop hai, nishchit rup se ekaatmak hai
 Hawking's new calculations have not been evaluated by the expert scientific community, because their methods are unintentional and of questionable conformity

 Leonard Saskind and Nobel Prize winner Gerard t Huft have suggested that the three-dimensional space around the black hole can be fully characterized by a two-dimensional behavior of the event horizon
 ve isapar vishwaas karte hai kyonki yah blike hole jaankaree-lop virodhabhas kaa samaadhaan kar saktaa he

 asimov ne jab 'robotics' shabd kaa istemaal kiya to unhen katai andaja nahin tha ki yah ek mul shabd bhi ho saktaa he; unka maananaa tha ki yah mekenix tathaa hidrouliks jaise shabdon ke samaan hi robots kaa saamaanya analog maatr he
 In contrast to his term psychohistory, the term robotics is used in mainstream technology as well as Asimov's original definition
 "positronic brence" ke saath fichard androids asimov ko is kaalpanik technology ke 'avishkaar' kaa purna shrey dete hai
 His fictional writing on space and time is similar to that of Brian W
 Aldis, Gregory Benford and Paul Anderson
 asimov ne 1929 main pehali baar apane parivaar ke kanfectionari store main bechi jane vaali science fiction kii sasti patrikaon ko padhanaa shuru kiya
 He came into contact with fans of science fiction in the mid-1930s, especially from the group that later became the Futurians
 unhone apni pehali science fiction kahani "cosmik corkescru" ko 1937 main likhnaa shuru kiya, lekin june 1938 main 'astounding science fiction' ke offis main jane ke baad mili prerana ke pashchaat hi ve use samaapt kar paae
 unhone "cosmik corkescru" ko 19 june ko samaapt kiya or uski kahani ko astounding ke sampadak jon dablyoo campbell ko do din baad nijee taur par dekar aaye
 Campbell rejected the "cosmic corkscrew" but encouraged Asimov to keep trying and Asimov did the same
 asimov ne apni teesri kahani "marund of vesta" ko oktober main 'ameging stories' ko bech diya or yah march 1939 ke sanskaran main prakashit kii gayi
 He continued his writing and occasionally sold his stories
 1941 main unhone apni 32veen kahani "nitfol" ko prakashit kiya jise ab tak kii sarvaadhik prasiddh kahani ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 In 1968, American science fiction writers selected "nightfall" as the best science fiction story ever written
 apni "nitfol and adar stories" naamak laghu katha sangrah main ve likhte hai, "'nitfol' kaa lekhan mere peshewar kariyar kaa ek nirnaayak mode tha
 

 i was suddenly taken seriously and the world of science fiction came to know about my existence
 samay bitne ke saath vastav main yah spasht ho gaya ki maine ek "utkrisht " kahani ko likhaa he
 "nightfall" is an early example of social science fiction
 'soshal science fiction' shabd ko asimov ne 1940 ke dashak ke ek nae chalan kaa varnan karne ke liye istemaal kiya tha
 Asimov and Heinlein were among the pioneering authors of this trend, which wrote about the state of man, moving away from instruments and space stories
 1941 tak asimov ne astounding ke liye niyamit rup se likhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 From 1943 to 1949, his entire publication in the field of science fiction was through Estounding
 1942 main unhone foundation siries kii pehali kahani ko prakashit kiya jisame bhavishya ke brahmad ke ek vishaal antartaarkeey samrajya ke patan tathaa punarjanm ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 His foundation trilogy includes three stories: The Foundation, the Foundation and Empire, and the Second Foundation
 This trilogy and robot series is considered to be his most famous science fiction work
 kai saal baad prashansakon dwaara asimov par dabaav daale jane kii vajah se unhone is shrankhla kii do anya kahaniyon foundations age ko likhaa or uske baad prilud tu foundation tathaa forward di foundation ke saath mul treeyology kii taraf dobaaraa rukh kiya
 In this series, their psychohistory is told, in which the future of a large section of the population can be predicted
 unhone apni positronic robot siries main sangrahit kiya gaya he) ko bhi lagbhag usee samay par shuru kiya gaya tha
 In them, some rules of ethics have been formulated for robots and other intelligent machines
 in niyamon ne is vishay ke anya lekhakon tathaa vichaarkon ko kaaphi prabhavit kiya he
 a film starring Robin Williams has been produced over one such short story, "the Bicentinal Man"
 varsh 2004 kii vil smith abhinit film 'ai, robot', jeff winter kii hardwyred naamak script par aadhaarit he
 This included Asimov's ideas later after acquiring the rights to 'I, Robot'
 yah harlan elisan kii 'ai, robot' script se sambandhit nahin he
 Harlan himself collaborated with Asimov to create a script that reflected the sentiments of Asimov's original version
 asimov ne kaha ki elisan ke screenple se "pehali vaastavik taur par vayask, jatil, tathaa acchhee science fiction film" kaa nirmaan sambhav ho sakegaa
 The screenplay was published in book form in 1994 as the chances of making a film based on it were becoming less likely
 filmon ke alaava unki foundation or robot kahaniyon ne science fiction ke anya sambandhit kaaryon ko bhi prerit kiya he, jiname se kai to roger maikbroid ellen, greg bear, gregory benford tathaa david brin jaise prasiddh or sthapit lekhakon dwaara hai
 These actions appear to have been done with the consent of Asimov's widowed wife, Janet Asimov, and at his request several times
 1948 main unhone chemistry ke ek spoof artical "di endocronic properties of rishablimeted thiotimolin" ko bhi likhaa
 us samay asimov apane doctoret tathaa uske baad kii maukhik pariksha kii kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 Fearing an adverse reaction by Columbia University's Graduate Assessment Board, Asimov requested his editor to print it under a pseudonym
 However, due to the mistake of the publisher, it was published under his own name
 uske baad kii maukhik pariksha ke dauraan asimov apane se puche gaye sawaalon ke kaaran kaaphi chintit ho gaye
 At the end of the examination, an examiner smilingly asked him, "mr
 Asimov, please tell us something about the thermodynamic properties of the thiotimoline compound"
 On hearing this, Asimov went to Sakpaka and was sent outside the room
 lagbhag 20 minute tak intjaar karne ke baad unhen pariksha kaksh main waapas bulaayaa gaya or "dow asimov" ke rup main sambodhit karte hue badhai di gayi
 In 1949, Walter I
, the science fiction editor of the book publisher Doubleday
 breadbari ne asimov ke aprakashit novellette "gro old elong vid main" ko prakaashan hetu sweekaar kar liya or anurodh kiya ki ise badhaakar 70,000 shabdon kii ek purna nowell kar diya jaye
 yah pustak janvari 1950 main dablade prakaashan ke tahat 'pebble in di ski' sheershak ke saath bazaar main aayi
 The doubleday company published six children's 'lucky Star' novels in the 1950s, along with five other Asimov original science fiction novels
 doubleday also printed Asimov's collection of short stories, beginning with 'the Martian Way' and 'other Stories' in 1955
 In the early 1950s the Gnome Press Company published a collection of Asimov's positronic robot series as 'I, Robot', and his Foundation Series and Novelts as three books of Foundation Trilogy
 Another positronic robot series was republished as a book called 'the Rest of the Robots'
 1950 ke dashak main gallexi magazine tathaa di magazine of phentasy & science fiction jaisi nayi science fiction patrikaon ke aane ke saath asimov ne apni laghu kathaon ko uname bhi prakashit karnaa shuru kar diya
 He later remembers the 1950s as his "golden decade"
 iname se kai kahaniyon ko unki 'best of anthology' main shaamil kiya gaya he, jaise, "di last queshchan", jo maanav jati dwaara entropy kii prakriya ko jhel paane tathaa use palat paane sambhavit kshamta ke bare main he
 Personally, she was most dear to him and in many thought it was similar to "nightfall"
 asimov ne ise 1973 main likhaa tha: Then, too, it has had the strangest effect on my readers
 Ask someone writes to ask me if i can give them the name of a story, which they think i may have written, and tell them where to find it
 They don't remember the title but when they describe the story it is invariably "the Last Question"
 This has reached the point where i recently received a long-distance phone call from a desperate man who began, 'dr
 Asimov, there's a story i think you wrote, whose title i can't remember - 'at which point i interrupted to tell him it was "the Last Question" and when i described the plot it proved to be indeed the story he was after 
 i left him convinced i could read minds at a distance of a thousand miles
 disambar 1974 main bital ke purv sadsy paul mecartni ne asimov se sampark kiya or poocha ki kya ve ek science fiction movie musical kaa screenple likh sakate hai
 mccartney had some vaguely plotted and dialogues regarding this; They wanted a story about rock band members who came to know about the creatures of the outside world who used to mimic them
 band or unke nakalchiyon ke kirdaar ko mecartni ke dal ke sadasyon dwaara nibhaayaa janaa tha jo us samay kaaphi prasiddh the
 Although Asimov was not a fan of rock music, he found the idea quite unique and he soon drew a brief outline of the story
 unhone mecartni ke vichaaron ke anuroop hi ek kahani likhi jo unke hisaab se kaaphi badhiya or naatakeey thi
 However, he did not use mccartney's dialogue and perhaps that is why mccartney rejected the story
 yah kahani ab keval boston vishvavidhyalay ke abhilekhaagaar main hi maujuud he
 Starting in 1977, Asimov gave his name to 'isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine' and wrote an editorial for each edition
 The 'asimovs SF Adventure Magazine' and 'asimovs Science Fiction Anthology' reprint series were also published as magazines for some time
 1950 or 1960 ke dashak ke ant main asimov ne apni gati main kuch had tak parivartan karte hue apane fiction lekhan kii maatra ko gata diya 
 iske saath hi unhone gaiyr-fiction ke kshetra main apane lekhan kii maatra ko kaaphi badha diya; 1957 main sputanik ke launch ne logon ke man main "science gap " ko lekar kaaphi chintaaen utpann kar deen
 Asimov's publishers were keen to bridge this gap through his writings
 is bich, masik patrika magazine of phentasy and science fiction ne unako apana niyamit gaiyr-fiction lekh jari rakhane ke liye aamantrit kiya jise uski sahyogi dwaimasik patrika venture science fiction magazine main shuru kiya gaya
 The magazine was devoted to popular science and Asimov was granted full editorial independence
 epa&esef kaa pehla stambh november 1958 main aayaa or asimov kii ghaatak beemaari tak lagaataar jari rahaa
 He wrote a total of 399 articles
 These columns were collected periodically by their main publisher doubleday and published as a book
 in stambhon ne asimov kii pahchaan vigyaan ke ek "great explaner " ke rup main sthapit karne main madad kii
 His first comprehensive work, The Intelligent Men's Guide to Science, helped him to relinquish most of his academic responsibilities and become a full-time freelance writer
 asimov ne apane samay ke saamaajik muddon par kai niabandh likhe jiname shaamil hai, "thinking about thinking" tathaa "science: nock plastic" 
 Impressed by the enormous amount of information contained in Asimov's writing, Kurt Vonnegut once asked, "how does it feel to know everything?" Asimov replied that he only knows what it feels like to be recognized as an omnipotent - "quite uncomfortable"
 See Chapter 30 of Joy Still Felt)
 In his introduction to his collection of stories 'slow Learner', Thomas Pynchon admitted that he used the science writing of Asimov for his knowledge of entropy
 yah asimov ke prati arthur si

 Asimov introduced the term robotics in his 1942 story Turnaround
 vigyaan ke kshetra ke alaava asimov itihaas main bhi kaaphi ruchi rakhte the
 Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular books of history, the most notable of which are The Greeks: a Great Adventure, The Roman Republic, The Roman Empire, The Egyptians, and The Near East: 10,000 Years of History
 unhone 'asimovs guide tu di bible' ko do wolums main prakashit kiya; 1967 main old testament tathaa 1969 main new testament or phir 1981 main in donon ko milakar 13,000 pannon kaa ek wolum taiyaar kiya
 This guide, complete with maps and tables, provides a systematic overview of the history of the books of the Bible and the political pressures affecting them, as well as information on the lives of important characters
 sahitya main unki ruchi kaa prakatikaran anekon saahitiyik kaaryon kii vyakhya ke rup main dikhaai detaa he, jiname shaamil hai, asimovs guide tu shakespeare, asimovs anotated paradise lost, tathaa di anotated gulivers travels 
 Asimov was also a notable mystery accountant and frequently wrote for 'ellery Queens Mystery Magazine'
 unhone apni vendal urth kii kahaniyon jaisi science fiction mistries ke lekhan se shuruyaat kii lekin jald hi "shuddh" mistries ke lekhan ke kshetra main kud pade

 He got this idea from his association with a group called 'trap Door Spiders' and all his main characters were based on his closest friends
 apane jivan ke antim dinon main asimov ne 1975 main aane vaali 'lesheras limerics' se shuruyaat karke limerics ke sangrahon kii ek shrankhla prakashit kii jiname se adhikansh ko unhone swayan hi likhaa tha
 Limericks: Two grosses include Asimov's 144 and John Sierdi's similar limericks
 unhone sharlokian limerics ke bhi ek patale wolum ko taiyaar kiya he 
 asimov ne 'azaazel, di tu centimetre dregon' main yidish parihaas ko daalaa he
 The two leading Jewish characters tell jokes about "george" and his friend Azazel during dinner, lunch and breakfast
 asimov kii 'tregeri of humar' ek chutkulon kii kitaab hone ke saath saath hasya ke siddhant ke upar unke vichaaron ko bhi prastut karti he
 According to Asimov, the most important element of humor is a sudden change in attitude, in which attention is shifted from important things to trivial things
 visheshkar unke baad ke varshon main asimov ne khud kii chhavi ko ek sarvapriya bhogi vyakti ke rup main prastut karne kii koshish kii
 In response to the popularity of erotic guidebooks such as 'the Sensuous Woman' and 'the Sensuous Man' in 1971, Asimov published "the Sensuous Dirty Old Man" under the name "doctor" a "
 asimov ne aatmakatha ke do wolum prakashit kiye: 'in memri yet green' tathaa 'in joy still felt' 
 teesri aatmakatha, 'ai, asimov: e memoir' ko april 1994 main prakashit kiya gaya
 Its epilogue was written a decade after his death by his widowed wife, Janet
 janet dwaara sampadit 'its been e good life', unki teenon aatmakathaaon kaa ek sankshipt sanskaran he
 He has also published three volumes of his earlier writings - Opus 100, Opus 200 and Opus 300

 Asimov and Star Trek producer Gene Rodenberry established a deep and unique relationship between the time Star Trek first debuted in the late 1960s
 asimov ne tivi guide patrika ke liye vaigyanik drushti se star treks kii sateekta ke sambandh main ek aalochanatmak niabandh likhaa tha
 Roddenberry respectfully wrote a private letter in response to the limitations of scientific accuracy while writing a weekly series
 asimov ne apni galati ko sweekaarte hue tivi guide ke liye ek or niabandh main likhaa ki apni galatiyon ke baavjood star treks ek naveen tathaa bauddhik rup se chunauteepurn science fiction tivi kaarykram he
 After this, the two became so close friends that Asimov also worked as a consultant in many Star Trek projects
 asimov kaa adhikansh fiction robot tathaa maanav ke bich ke sambandh or in donon par padane vaale prabhaavon ke bare main he, khaskar manushyon par
 unki pehali robot kahani "robi" ek robotic naini ke bare main he
 "lenny" talks about the ability by robocycologist Susan Colvin to experience maternal love for a robot whose brain's positronic ability is similar to that of a three-year-old child
 jaise jaise robot adhik aadhunik hote gaye unke kaary bhi adhik vyapak tathaa jatil hote gaye
 The story of "evidence" revolves around a candidate who is presumably a robot in human disguise and successfully wins the election
 "avitable conflict" main robot puri maanav jati ke nainij ke rup chupake chupake maanavtaa ko niyantrit karte hai
 Later in 'robots of Dawn' and 'robots and Empire', a robot develops a law he calls the Geroth Law of Robotics, according to which, "no robot will harm humanity, or humanity will die because of inaction
" Will not let any danger come over "
 He also decided that the presence of robots is strangling the freedom of humanity and that it would be best for the robots to slowly remove themselves
 a non-robotic, time-travel novel 'the End of Eternity' depicts similar conflicts and resolutions
 jiroth lau kii visheshta yah he ki ye robotics ke anya sabhi niyamon par baari padataa he: yadi koi robot swayan ko aisi paristhiti main paata he jahaan puri maanav jati kii raksha ke liye use kisi manushya kii hatya kerani pade, to robot kii positronic programing ke anusaar uske liye aisa karnaa anivaary ho jaayegaa
 keval ati unnat robot hi is niyam ko samaj sakate hai
 a scientist in the foundation series implements a semi-secret plan to build a galactic empire over a period of 1000 years
 is siries main yojana ko purna karne tathaa uski suraksha ke liye platonic gargiens kaa 'second foundation' naamak apana hi varjan he
 When Asimov stopped writing the series in the 1950s, the Second Foundation was portrayed as the gentle protectors of humanity
 jab 1980 ke dashak main unhone siries ko punah likhnaa shuru kiya to unhone keretekar thims ko or bhi adhik spasht karke prastut kiya
 'foundations Age presented a house called Gaia which was naturally based on the Gaia Hypothesis
 gaiya kaa prayek jaanavar, ped or khanij ek saajha chetana ke hisse hai jo sarvakalyaan ke liye milakar kaam karne vaale ek super-mind kaa nirmaan karte the
 In "foundation and Earth" the protagonist begins to explore the Earth because he thinks he will find the answer to why in the 'foundation's Age' he decides that Galaxia is the right choice
 gaiya, samuhik jaagrukta kii sambhaavna kii talash hetu asimov ke sarvshereshth prayaason main se he or 'nemesis' main ve isko or adhik jatilta kaa jama pahanaate hue arethro naamak jivit grih ke bare main likhte hai jahaan kaa jivan mukhyatah prokeriotic he or jo manushyon ke saath samanvay sthapit karne kii koshish karata he
 Robots have been introduced to the foundation universe at Foundation and Earth for the first time
 asimov kii antim novels main se do, 'prilud tu foundation' tathaa 'forward di foundation' main unke bartaav ke bare main vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 Robots are depicted as covert workers working for the good of humanity

 In 'bicentennial Man' a robot fights against people's prejudice towards being accepted as a human
 'kevs of steel' main prithvivasi antariksh ke ameerjaadon se nafrat karte hai or isliye robots ke saath vaisaa hi vyavhaar karte hai jaisaa ki shwet log ashweton ke prati karte hai " kah kar bulaanaa)
 'pebble in di ski' main ek aisi hi paristhiti ko chitrit kiya gaya he: prithvi par galactic empire kaa shashan he or uske log "ardi-squai jaise shabdon kaa prayog karte hai, lekin prithvi ek theocratic taanaashaahee he jahaan 60 saal se adhik umr ke sabhi logon par jabardastee ichhamrityu thope di jaati he
 The name of a hero is Bel Arvardan, a high-class galactic archaeologist and determined to overcome his prejudices

 It is necessary for him to decide whether he should help a suffering society that wishes for his death
 asimov kaa ek anya priy vishay he tarksangat sonch
 unhone apni nauvel 'di kevs of steel' tathaa 'asimovs mistry' kii kahaniyon main science-fiction mistry ko izaad kiya he or apane pathakon ke prati nishpaksh rahete hue samaadhaan main istemaal kisi bhi vigyaan athwa takanic ke bare main shuru main bataa diya he
 He later also wrote non-science fiction mysteries, including Novell titled 'murder at the ABA' and short stories from "black Widowers" and "union Club", in which he followed the same rules
 unke fiction main bahes / charchaa ko kaaphi mahatva diya gaya he jahaan adhik tarksangat, maanviya tathaa apni baat ko adhik balpurvak kehane vaale paksh kii jeet hoti he
 The most common feature of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is very simple
 1980 main science fiction ke vidwaan tathaa kensas vishvavidhyalay main profesar ameritas james gunn ne 'ai, robot' ke sambandh main likhaa: Gunn found that Asimov's style in many places changed according to the situation; He used "lire!" As an example of this
 Has cited the climax of
 unki kahani kii mahatvapurn jagahon par anokhi tarah ke charitra ubhar kar saamne aate hai: "lair!" tathaa "avidence" kii susaan kelvin ke atirikt 'second foundation' main arkadi direll, 'kevs of steel' main elizah beli, tathaa foundation ke prequel main harry celdan ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Asimov answered this criticism in the beginning of his book 'nemesis': asimov dwaara 1940 tathaa 1950 ke dashak main bhavishya main istemaal kii jane vaali kai kaalpanik takneekein abhi tak prakat nahin hui hai
 For example, those who describe future powerful robots and computers using punched cards or punched tape, and engineers who use slide rules
 'foundation and empire' ke ek naatakeey drishy main ek charitra vending mashin se akhbaar ko kharidte hue dikhaaya jaataa he
 Of course, this charge can be levied on virtually any writer of science fiction and it is not at all rational
 iske alaava, unki kahaniyon main yada-kada aatanrik virodhabhas bhi dekhne ko miltaa he: udhaaharan ke liye, foundation siries ke naam tathaa tithiyaan hameshaa ek duusare se mail nahin khate hai
 Some of the possible reasons for such mistakes may be mistakes made by the characters, as the characters in Asimov's stories are often unaware of their circumstances
 anya virodhabhaason kaa kaaran yah he ki asimov dwaara foundation siries shuru karne tathaa usapar dobaaraa kaam karne ke bich kai varshon kaa antar he; kai baar vigyaan kii unnati ke kaaran unhen apane kaalpanik itihaas ko badalane ke liye bhi majaboor hona padaa he
 Apart from the books by Gunn and Petroch, there is a lack of "literary" criticism over Asimov's writing
 Possible reasons for this are given in Kovart and Weimer's Dictionary of Literary Biography: nishpaksh taur par yadi dekha jaye to gunn tathaa petrope, donon dwaara asimov ke lekhan ke sambandh main kiye gaye adhyayanon ke anusaar lekhan kii ek spasht tathaa pratyaksh style bhi ek prakaar kii style hi he
 Gunn's 1982 book makes a very in-depth commentary on all of Asimov's novels published so far
 ve asimov ke sabhi fiction lekhan kii prashansa nahin karte hai, lekin 'kevs of steel' ke kuch vaakyon ke bare main itnaa avashya kehete hai ki ve "prost kii yaad taaja karte hai"
 us upanyaas main bhavishya ke new york shahar main raatri kaa andhkaar chaane ke vishay par charchaa karte hue gunn kehete hai ki asimov ke gadhy ko "saahitiyik samaaj main kahin bhi sharmasaar hone kii aavashyaktaa nahin he"
 Although he took great pride in his ornate prose style, Asimov also enjoyed providing a complex look to his narrative structure by often randomly presenting chapters of his long stories
 kuch pathakon ko yah style katai pasand nahin he, ve shikaayat karte hai ki yah betaratib tarika vyarth main hi unki mushkilen badhaata he or kahani kii spashtataa par bhi pratikul prabhaav daalata he
 For example, the opening one-third of 'the Gods' Demelves' begins with chapter 6 and then completes the back-and-forth story
 main kahani ko jitna sambhav ho utani der se shuru karen
 This advice helped Asimov write an early robot story called "reason"
 us samay kii jaankaree ke liye 'in memory yet green' dekhen
) petrope ne paaya ki 'di karents of spes' ke aapas main uljhe hue tathaa jude hue flashbek ke kaaran upanyaas ko kaaphi nuksaan hua he, itnaa ki keval koi "kattar asimov prashansak" hi iskaa anand le saktaa he
 Asimov's tendency to distort his timeline can be seen most clearly in 'nemesis' in which some characters live in the "present" while some in the "past"
 The story of past tense characters begins 15 years ago and slowly moves towards the present
 2002 main east carolina vishvavidhyalay ke ek angreji professor donald palumbo ne "keos theory, asimovs foundations and robots, and harbarts dune: di fractal esthetic of apik science fiction" ko prakashit kiya
 It reviews the style of Asimov's stories and compares them to Fractals and Chaos
 palumbo ne paaya ki haalaanki sahitya ke paaramparik lakshanon kaa abhaav he yaa ve kaaphi had tak anupasthit bhi he, foundation tathaa robot metaciris ke prati aakarshan bana hua he
 According to him the purposeful intricacies of the story create a special kind of attraction towards him
 is wolum main saahitiyik drushti se asimov kii ab tak kii sabase gahari aalochana kii gayi he
 Asimov is also criticized in his science fiction for his lack of sexuality and the life of the outside world
 asimov ne ek baar samajhate hue kaha ki aliens ke bare main likhane se ve isliye kataraate hai kyonki unke kariyar kii shuruyaat main ek baar astounding ke sampadak jon campbell ne unki science fiction kahani ko isliye asweekaar kar diya tha kyonki usame aliens ko manushyon se behatar dikhaaya gaya tha
 He decided that instead of showing the character of aliens weak in his stories, he would not write about them at all
 haalaanki, in aalochanaon ke jawaab main unhone 'di gods demaselvs' ko likhaa jisame aliens, sex, tathaa aliens kaa sex shaamil hai
 Asimov said that out of all his writings, he is most proud of the part of 'the Gods Demelves' where these subjects have been written
 hugo eward vijeta nowell "gold" main asimov swayan par aadhaarit ek lekhak kaa varnan karte hai jisaki ek pustak ke upar ek compu-drama banaaya jaataa he jo mukhyatah ek photo-realistic computer anemeshan he
 The director criticizes Asimov's non-visual writing style because it is a difficult task to make a film on him, while Asimov understands that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than narration to make his point
 apane shuruaati kaary main shashakt mahila charitron kaa abhaav hone ke kaaran bhi kai logon ne unki aalochana kii he
 In his autobiographical writings, he admits this and explains the reason for his inexperience
 unke baad ke upanyaason main mahila charitron kii sankhya to badi lekin lekhan style main koi badlaav nahin aayaa, jisaki vajah se yah mudda pathakon main kaaphi vyapak str par charchit ho gaya
 For example, the "book World" section of the Washington Post on August 25, 1985, writes about 'robots and Empire': haalaanki, vastav main is baat kaa dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki 'di neced san' main saamaajik muddon ko sarvaadhik mahatva diya gaya he
 It depicts genetic engineering as an integral part of that society under the guise of eugenics and presents to the reader a person who is the focal point of the artificial environment as well as a hero who is on Earth's " General "archeology"

 To achieve the objectives of an organization, establishing coordination and coordination among its various activities is called 'coordination'
 yah prabandh kaa vah kaary he jo kisi sanstha ke vibhinn vibhaagon, karmchaariyon tathaa uske samoohon main is prakaar ekikaran sthapit karata he ki nunatam laagat par wachhint uddeshyon kii purti main sahaayta milti he
 'coordination is the essence of management
 ’ saar kisi vastu kii aantarik prakruti athwa uske mahatvapurn gun kaa naam he
 Coordination is the key element that makes up the management process
 yah niyojan kii avasthaa main hi prarambh ho jaataa he tathaa sanghathan, nirdesan, niyantran aadi sabhi kaaryon ke saath chalata he
 It is only through coordination that the management can provide the following desired results like- yadhyapi samanvay swayan ek mahatvapurn prabandhkeey kaary he, kintu yah anya sabhi prabandh kaaryon kii kunjee he
 Its role in other works is as follows: - nishkarsh swaroop yah kaha ja saktaa he ki samanvayan sabhi prabandh kaaryon kaa saar tatv he
 It seeks to achieve the desired results by harmonizing the objectives, departmental, functions, tools and individual and collective efforts of the organization
 samanvayan kii kuch pramukh paribhaashaayen is prakaar hai :- 1
 Moon and Raleigh: “co-ordination is the arrangement of collective efforts for the purpose of harmonizing and maintaining synergies in the various actions performed to fulfill a common purpose
 ” "co-ordination is an orderly arrangement of group effort to provide unity of action in pursuit of common purpose
" 2 
 mecfarland : “samanvayan vah prakriya he jiske dwaara ek prabandhak apane adhinsthon main samuhik prayaas kaa ek suvyavasthit swaroop viksit karata he tathaa samuhik uddeshy kii prapti ke liye kriya sambandhi ekta sthapit karata he
 " "co-ordination is the process whereby an executive develops an orderly pattern of group effect among his subordinates and secures unity of action in the pursuit of common purpose
" 3
 Kontz and o'donnell: "coordination arranges to harmonize individual efforts to achieve collective goals
 ” "co-ordination is the essence of management for the achievement of harmony of individual efforts towards the accomplishment of group goals
" 4 
 henry feol : “kisi sanstha ke kaary sanchaalan ko suvidhajanak evam safal banane ke liye uski samast kriyaaon main talmail sthapit karnaa hi samanvayan kehalaata he
 " "co-ordination is to harmonise all the activities of a concern in order to facilitate its working and its success
" 5
 George R
 Terry: “coordination is the integration process of management that enables members of the organizational team to move forward with determination and full confidence in the organization's goals
 ” The features of coordination are as follows: - 1 
 prabandhkeey uttardaayitv : samanvay ek prabandhkeey uttardaayitv he
 This work starts with planning
 sanghathan nirmaan ke samay ise yojanabaddh vidhi se sthapit kiya jaataa he or badalati hui paristhitiyon main prabandhak ise banaae rakhane kaa prayaas karte rahete hai
 2 
 Collective efforts: Coordination is required only in relation to collective efforts because individual efforts do not affect the actions of others in any way
 3 
 ek nirantar tathaa gatisheel prakriya : sanghathan main kisi na kisi prakaar ke samanvay kii aavashyaktaa nirantar bani rahati he
 Management often tries to achieve a high level of coordination
 4 
 kaarywahi kii ekta : samanvay kaa uddeshy kaarywahi kii ekta utpann karnaa he, jisase ki sabhi prayaas ek hi disha main prashast hon, santulit hon tathaa ek duusare kii sahpurti karen
 Management concepts and organizational behavior 5 
 aantarik evam bahya samanvay : aantarik samanvay ke antargat sanghathan ke bhinn-bhinn bhaagon, kaaryon evam uddeshyon main talmail karnaa padataa he jabaki bahya samanvay ke antargat sanghathan tathaa iske bahari vaataavaran kaa samanvay shaamil he
 Regarding the nature of coordination, the following things are remembered: - 1 
 samanvayan sanstha ke sheersh prabandh kaa uttardaayitv he
 This is an important part of his leadership work that he cannot ignore
 2 
 samanvayan ek prakriya he koi sthaayee vyakti nahin
 In every institution, more or less coordination is always present, but the managers should be constantly trying to achieve a higher level of coordination
 3 
 samanvayan samuhik prayaason ke liye hai, vyaktigat prayaason ke liye nahin
 4
 Completing collective goals is difficult without coordination
 5 
 prayaason main samanvay banaaye rakhane ke liye prayek kaaryakrtta ko sanstha ke lakshyon kaa gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Wherever there will be individual, group of people, purpose, action, coordination is required
 audyogic sanghathan ke kshetra main iskaa vishesh mahatv hota he
 Because if the production is not done on time or its variety becomes inferior or the cost of production is high, then the existence of the organization is questioned
 ek acchhee prakaar se prastut kiya gaya arcestra shrotaaon evam darshakon ko bahut prabhavit karata he
 The secret of success behind it is coordination
 kyonki unka master vibhinn kalakaaron kii kriyaaon main samanvay karata he tabhi acha kaarykram prastut ho paata he
 The same applies in the areas of management
 itnaa hi nahin anya kshetron kii apeksha samanvay prabandh ke kshetra main adhik mahatvapurn hota he
 Because in this field, individual and collective objectives, different departments, many activities have to be coordinated
 ek audyogic sanghathan main samanvay kii aavashyaktaa nimnlikhit kaarane se hoti he
 1
 Division of labor and specialization: The present age is of division and specialization of labor, as a result of which one main action is divided into many small sub-operations
 or prayek upakriyaaon ko alag-alag vyaktiyon yaa vyakti samoohon ko saunpa jaataa he
 Who are experts in that action
 jisase adhiktam kaarykushalta kaa laabh uthaaya ja sake
 While on the one hand we derive the benefits of division of labor and specialization, on the other hand we also face the difficulty of coordination
 prayek vyakti usee kaary main daksh ho jaataa he jise vah nirantar kar rahaa he
 And he is not able to associate himself with total work
 atah is dosha ko dur karne ke liye samanvay kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 2 
 Different departments mean independent existence: The present era is the era of mass production where the size of the organization is very large
 ek sanghathan main anek vibhaag hote hai
 Due to the process of decentralization, these departments have the right to make independent decisions in many subjects
 is swatantrata ke kaaran aisi sthiti bhi aa jaati he ki ek vibhaag ke dwaara liye gaye nirnay, duusare vibhaagon ke kaaryon, hiton evam nitiyon se tathaa sanghathan ke hiton se talmail nahin khate
 Hence coordination is required
 3 
 sanghathan main maanviya tatv : prayek sanghathan main kaary karne vaale vyakti hote hai or prabandhakon ko in karmchaariyon se kaam lenaa hota he
 Human nature is naturally very variable, fickle and asymmetrical, which many times starts functioning beyond the organizational objectives
 jiskaa prabhaav uske kaaryon par padataa he
 Therefore, coordination is required there
 samanvay kii aavashyaktaa kaa ek anya kaaran yah he ki samanvay main vibhinn staron par alag-alag maatr main adhikaar saunpe jate hai
 People who get less rights, they often have estrangement from their higher officials
 atah ise dur karne ke liye bhi samanvay kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Some people consider coordination and cooperation synonymous with each other
 lekin yahan yah spasht karnaa bada mahatvapurn he ki samanvay ek pranali he jabaki sahyog ek vidhi
 Cooperation means working with each other voluntarily for a common purpose, while under coordination, an officer coordinates the efforts of various individuals and departments with proper efforts to achieve the set goals and objectives
 Can go sahyog vyakti kii swechha se hota he, uske liye unhe baadhya nahin kiya ja saktaa, lekin samanvay ke antargat adhikari anek prayaas karke vyaktiyon tathaa vibhaagon kii kriya main talmail evam samaajasya sthapit karata he
 Coordination is mostly established from the very beginning by the appropriate authorities according to certain programs, while cooperation is done by different individuals on the basis of their own mutual relations
 samanvay ek dirghakaalin prakriya he, jo ki niyojan se prarambh hoti he or niyantran tak chalati he
 Collaboration is a temporary process that depends on the mutual thoughts, relationships and environment of the organization
 samanvay ke antargat keval vyakti apane prayaso ko ek duusare ke prayaason se milaane kaa praytn karte he
 It becomes clear that coordination and cooperation are not completely separate
 samanvay kaa ek uddeshy sahyog sthapit karnaa bhi hota he
 Some scholars consider coordination to be a separate work of management, but some management experts do not consider it a separate work of management
 feol tathaa brtch samanvay ko prabandh kaa ek alag kaary maanate he
 Conversely, Kontz and o-donnell, modern scholars, do not consider coordination to be a separate work of management
 unka kahana he ki samanvay prabandh kii prakriya se is prakaar juda hua he ki ham ise alag kriya nahin kah sakate
 William Sprigal called the management the power of co-ordination
 pro hamen kaa kahana he ki prabandh kaa koi bhi kaary kyon na ho, chaahe vah niyojan ho yaa niyantran, sanghathan karnaa ho, niyukti karnaa yaa aadesh dena sabhi main samanvay kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 This is also true
 udhaaharan ke liye yojana banaate samay alag-alag vibhaagon kii yojana tathaa anya up-yojanaon ko ek duusare ke saath is prakaar se samanvit karnaa padataa he ki vah sampoorn sanstha kii yojana kaa ek ang ban jaae
 We have to run many programs to separate the plan
 in kaaryakramon kaa samay kram evam samay upyog is prakaar samanvit karnaa padataa he, jisase, ki sampoorn sanstha ke kaary thik prakaar chalate rahen
 The managers also have to coordinate between the available resources and the objectives of the institution
 yadi saadhan kam he to paryaapt lakshya nirdhaarit nahin kiye ja sakate
 An organization is required to implement plans properly
 vastav main, ham vibhinn vyaktiyon ke kaaryo main samanvay rakhane ke liye hi sanghathan banaate he
 Therefore organization is the basis of coordination
 sanghathan banane ke baad vibhinn vyaktiyo kii niyukti kerani padati hai or niyukti karte samay aavashyak yogyata, karmchaaree sankhya aadi kaa dhyaan bhi rakhana padataa he
 Coordination refers to the process of care that takes care of the work of two or more persons and coordinates them
 yadi koi karmchaaree thik prakaar se kaary nahin karata ho, to abhiprerana kii takanic kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 The last function of management is also related to control
 duusare shabdon main niyantran kii aavashyaktaa hi samanvay karne ke liye paidaa hoti he niyantran main ham yah dekhte he ki prayek vibhaag tathaa prayek karmchaaree nirdhaarit kaaryo ko purv nishchit yojana ke anusaar kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 If any deficiency is found then an attempt is made to remove it
 meri parket folate ke shabdo main- The basic idea about the principle of coordination was given by Mary Parkett
 unhone samanvay ke chaar moolbhoot siddhanth bataae hai tathaa ye siddhanth samanvay kii takanic se alag he
 The following is a brief description of these principles
 1 
 prarambh se hi upyog - samanvay kaa kaary prabandh kii praarambhik vyavastha se hi armbh kar dena chahie
 If we do not do the coordination work separately from the beginning, then it will be difficult and unproductive to coordinate later
 udhaaharan ke liye ek sanstha kaa prabandhak maal kharidne ke liye aadesh de detaa he lekin baad main vittiya prabandhak se pataa chalata he ki sanstha main iske liye dhan kii vyavastha nahin he to samanvay sthapit karnaa bada kathin hoga
 Similarly, if the sales manager accepts an order to sell the goods without knowing about his stock, then in no case the goods can be supplied on time
 atah yojana banaate samay hi or kaaryo ko prarambh karne se pehle hi samanvay sthapit ho janaa chahie
 2 
 Direct contact - The second principle of coordination is that there should be direct contact with the whole person
 pratyaksh sampark hone se samanvay sheeghra sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 This promotes mutual understanding and cooperation and red tape is not born
 vaise bhi samanvay kii safalataa spasht evam sheeghra savanhan par nirbhar karti he or iske liye pratyaksh sampark hona aavashyak he, jisase ki do vyaktiyon tathaa vibhaagon ke bich main kisi bhi prakaar kaa bhram paidaa na ho
 3
 Continuity - It is said about coordination that this is an ongoing process
 yadi ise bich main chhod diya jayega to anek samasyaayein paidaa ho sakati he
 Therefore, it is necessary that there should be continuous coordination between the objectives and efforts of the organization and the employees, progress and goals etc
 kabhi-kabhi kuch vishesh samanvay samitiyaan samanvay kii kuch mahatvapurn samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye banaai jaati he
 But this cannot solve the problem
 yah aavashyak he ki samanvay kaa kaary nirantar chalata rahe
 4
 Mutuality - When used together, different elements influence each other and remain connected to each other
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sabhi vyaktiyo ke kaaryo hito aadi main ekikaran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or ekikaran karne ke liye paraspar sambandho ko dhyaan main rakhkar samanvay kiya jaataa he
 For example, all departments of sales, production, finance and employees are related to each other and depend on each other
 yadi ham utpaadan badhanaa chaahate he to atirikt vitt evam karmchaaree kii aavashyaktaa hogi or vikray prabandh ko adhik maal bechnaa padegaa
 If we take out some employees, then we will save some of our finances, but there will be a fear of decreasing the production of another
 atah spasht ho jaataa he ki sabhi vyakti evam kaary ek duusare par nirbhar hote he
 The major modes of coordination are as follows: 1 
 aadesh shrunkhlaa dwaara samanvayan - sanghathan siddhanth ke anusaar, prayek varisht adhikri ko apane adhinsthon ko aadesh dene kaa adhikaar hota he
 Therefore, the work of subordinate employees has been coordinated by their superiors
 is prakaar aadesh shrikhla dwaara samanvay sthapit ho jaataa he
 2 
 Coordination by Personal Leadership - According to the opinion of the Branch, coordination is a human process and the manager establishes it through his personal conduct
 safal netritv ke liye jin baton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, unki aavashyaktaa safal samanvayan ke liye bhi padati he
 3
 Co-ordination by Committees - Some committees are only disciplining and some are decision making
 anushaasan athwa nirnay bahumat par aadhaarit hota he
 The High Officer constitutes a committee of various heads to establish coordination
 isse use sabhi prakaar ke drushtikonon se avgat hone kaa avasar miltaa he tathaa falswaroop sanstha kii sthapana sugam ho jaati he
 4
 Co-ordination by self-coordination - Often the department heads and other officers in business organizations work to establish coordination in their respective fields
 kintu iske samuhik uddeshyon kii purti hona kathin he
 It is also necessary that in addition to coordinating in each field, every officer should also see that the activities of other officers are not affected
 5 
 saamaanya staff dwaara samanvayan - swa-samanvayan kii dasha main prayek adhikari apni yojana main anya adhikariyon kii apeksha suvidhajanak parivartan karne kaa virodh karata he or anubhav karata he ki use amuk adhikariyon kii apeksha kam mahatv diya ja rahaa he
 To overcome this flaw, general assistants are being used in large organizations
 saamaanya vibhaag ko sanstha ke sabhi vibhaagon dwaara soochna milti rahati he
 Due to its specific position, this department can decide which information of which department can be beneficial for other departments or departments
 is prakaar, saamaanya vibhaag ke dwaara bhi samanvay sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 6
 Coordinating by specific coordinators - In some entities, specific coordinators may be established to coordinate by different aspects of the business
 udaahranarth, spinning and vibing vibhaagon ke bich samanvay sthapit karne ke liye vishisht vyakti ho saktaa he jiskaa kaam keval spinning vibhaag kii pragati ko viving vibhaag tak pahunchaana he, jisase donon ke kriyakalapon main samanvay bana rahe
 7
 Coordination by supervision - Supervision is considered an important means of coordination right from the beginning
 paryvekshak kaa pramukh karttavya apane adhinsthon kii kriyaaon kaa paryvekshan karnaa evam unamem samanvay sthapit karnaa hota he
 8
 Coordination by personal contact - Through personal contact, coordination can be established in the objectives of the organization, its legal activities and control 
 bhrantiyon ke nivaaran ke liye vyaktigat sampark hi ek sanjivani he
 9
 Co-ordination through planning - The main objective of planning is to reconcile goals, policies and tools
 is prakaar niyojan swayan samanvay kii ek mahatvapurn takanic he
 10
 Co-ordination by written communication - This technique is used as a complement to personal communication
 patr, bulatin, magazine, taar, telephone, radio, cinema aadi iske udhaaharan hai
 11
 Coordination by budget - Based on budgets, various departments conduct their activities
 master bajet sabakaa niyantranakrtta va samanvayak hota he
 In this way control devices can actually be called coordination techniques
 12
 sanghathan dwaara samanvayan - dawavadam ke anusaar sanghathan upkram kii vibhinn kriyaaon main samanvayan sthapit karne kaa shreshth saadhan he
 13
 Other Techniques - Under this heading the following can be included- 1980 europea cap final main england ke nottingham forest 1-0 germany ke hamberg parajeet dekha ki, 28 may 1980 par santiyago bernboo stadium, madrid main yojit ek footbal match tha
 In the 21st minute, John Robertson squeezed a shot past Hamburg keeper Rudolf Kergus for the game's only goal, to give the Nottingham Forest back-to-back European Cup title
 Victory Nottingham Forest became the first club to have won the European Cup more often than their domestic league
 coffee — ek lokapriy peya padaarth he, jo coffee ke ped ke bhune hue bijon se banaaya jaataa he
 Due to caffeine in coffee, it has a mild stimulant effect
 iske vishay main vaigyanikon kaa koi nishchit mat nahin hai
 While on one hand coffee is said to increase the activation of sperm, on the other hand some studies have also shown that drinking more coffee can also cause hallucinations
 yah mana jaataa he ki coffee kaa paudha sabase pehle 600 isvi main ithiopia ke kapha praant main khoja gaya tha
 According to a legend, on a sluggish afternoon this infrequent plant came to the notice of an Ethiopian shepherd named Kaladi when he saw sudden agility and quickness in the behavior of his animals
 sari bheden ek paudhe ke gahare laal rang ke bijon ko char rahi thim, jiske baad ve pehle se zyaada urjavan or aanandit lag raheen thim
 Kaldi himself ate some seeds and soon he too experienced an energy and strength like his sheep
 coffee kai prakaar kii hoti he
 Espresso - to make it, the hard black coffee is prepared in an espresso machine by steaming the steam out of the deep-brushed strong-smelling coffee grains
 isaki sataha par sunahare-bhure kriim ke hote hai
 Cappuccino - Consists of equal amounts of hot milk and milk cream
 kaife latte kaifai latte main ek bhaag aspreso kaa ek shot or teen bhaag garm doodh hota he
 In Italian latte means milk
 jiske kaaran iskaa yah naam padaa he
 Frappie - is cold espresso, served in a tall glass with ice and can also be added to milk
 dakshin bhartiya filter coffee ko dardri pisi hui, halki gahari sinki hui coffee arabika se banaaya jaataa he
 Peabri seeds are most preferred with this
 ise parosane kiye jane ke pehle ek paaramparik dhaatu ke coffee filter main ghanton tak risa kar athwa tapakaakar taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 The instant coffee is dried by spraying the coffee liquid at a very low temperature
 phir use ghulansheel powder yaa coffee ke daanon main badalakar instant coffee taiyaar kii jaati he
 Mocha or mocachino is a mixture of cappuccino and cafe latte mixed with chocolate syrup or powder
 yah kai prakaar main uplabdh hoti he
 Black coffee is a dripped or French press style coffee that is served directly without adding milk
 iced coffee main saamaanya coffee ko barf ke saath or kabhi-kabhi doodh or shakkar milakar parosa jaataa he
 Namaste or Namaskar is a term mainly used by Hindus and Indians to show greetings and humility when they meet each other
 is bhav kaa arth he ki sabhi manushyon ke hriday main ek divine chetana or prakaash he jo anahath chakra main sthit he
 The word derives from the Sanskrit Namas word
 is bhavamudra kaa arth he ek aatma kaa duusari aatma se aabhaar prakat karnaa
 In everyday life, the word Namaste is used to meet someone or to say good luck while taking leave or to greet
 namaste ke atirikt namaskara or pranaam shabd kaa prayog karte hai
 According to Sanskrit grammar, its origin is as follows - Namaste = Namah + Te
 arthath tumhaare liye pranaam
 In Sanskrit, 'namah' is invariably used for worship or respect, such as "surya Namah"
 isi prakaar yahan- "tumhaare liye pranaam he", ke liye yushmad kii chaturthi vibhakti kaa prayog hota he
 By the way, the common usage of Sanskrit for "for you" is "tubhyam", but the alternate, abbreviated form of "te" is also used a lot, here the same is used
 atah namaste kaa shabdic arth he- tumhaare liye pranaam
 It can also be called "salute you" or "salute you"
 parantu iskaa sanskrit rup hameshaa "tumhaare liye namah" hi rahata he, kyonki namah avyay ke saath hameshaa chaturthi vibhakti aati he, aisa niyam he
 To salute, both hands are placed on the Anahata Chak, the eyes are closed and the head bowed
 iske alaava The word hello is now worldwide
 vishwa ke adhikansh sthanon par iskaa arth or taatpary samajha jaataa he or prayog bhi karte hai
 As a fashion, it is custom to say Namaste in many places
 yadhyapi pashchim main "namaste" bhavamudra ke sangyojan main bolaa jaataa he, lekin bharat main ye mana jaataa he ki bhavamudra kaa arth namaste hi he or isliye, is shabd kaa bolnaa itnaa aavashyak nahin mana jaataa he
 Divine love flows by bringing the hands on the heart chakra
 sir ko jhukaane or ankhen band karne kaa arth he apane aap ko hriday main virajman prabhu ko apane aap ko saunp dena
 One can also be Namaste to drown in deep meditation; It is a beautiful and intense meditation when done with someone else
 ek shikshak or vidhyaarthee jab ek duusare ko namaste kehete hai to do vyakti urjaatmak rup se ve samay or sthaan se rahit ek judaav bindu par ek duusare ke nikat aate hai or ahan kii bhaavana se mukt hote hai
 If this is done by dedicating the mind with a deep sense of heart, then a kindred relationship is formed between two souls
 adarsh rup se, namaste kaksha ke aarambh or samaapti par kiya janaa chahie
 This is usually done at the end of class because then the mind is less active and the energy of the room is more calm
 shikshak namaste kahkar apane chaatro or apane shikshakon kaa abhivadan karata he or apane chaatro kaa swaagat karata he ki ve bhi utane hi gyanvaan bane or satya kaa pravaah ho
 Avascular anaerobics are microorganisms that cannot tolerate a large amount of oxygen and die in its normal atmospheric concentration
 bhinn jatiyon kii oxigen-sahansheeltaa bhi bhinn hoti he - kuch to 8% oxigen tak main jivit rah sakate hai jabaki kuch 0
5% se kam main hi ji pate hai

 Analgesic nephropathy is damage to the kidneys caused by analgesic drugs such as phenacetin, paracetamol and aspirin

 Typical renal diseases caused by analgesics are renal papillary necrosis and chronic intraarterial nephritis
 ve donon aamtaur par rakt kaa pravaah kam hone ke kaaran, antioxident ke teji se upbhog or gurde ko hone vaali uttarvarti oxidetive kshati ke kaaran hote hai

 Analgesic nephropathy was at one time the common cause of kidney damage and end-stage kidney disease in Australia and many areas of the United States
 adhikansh kshetron main, 1970 or 1980 ke dashak main phenastin ke upyog main kami aane ke baad isamen tezi se giravat ai
 Analgesics are a class of drugs that are widely used in the treatment of pain
 inamen aspirin or anya gaiyr steroodel sujan-rodhi dawaaen shaamil hai or saath hi antipyreeticparacitamol or phenacetin shaamil hai
 After coming into existence in the early 19th century, phenacetin used to be a common component of compounding analgesics in Australia, Europe, and the United States
 in mishrit peedaaharakon main aamtaur par aspirin phenacetin, paracitamol yaa salicyllamide or caffiin yaa kodin sahit anya NSAID maujuud hote hai
 In the 1950s, Spooler and Zollinger reported the association between excessive use of phenacetin and kidney damage
 inhone kaha ki phenacetin kaa upyog karne vaale puraane logon main kuch vishisht bimariyaan jaise, vrikkeey papila koshikakshay or chirkaari antaraleey vrikkashoth ke sankraman kii zyada sambhaavna thi
 This condition was termed analgesic nephropathy and phenacetin was attributed to it, although no absolute causal role was demonstrated
 yadhyapi aage kii reporte, jiske anusaar phenacetin ke atyadhik upyog se gurde ko haani kii sambhaavna bad jaati thi, ko kai deshon main 60 or 80 ke dashak main pratibandhit kar diya gaya| As the use of phenacetin decreased, so did the prevalence that analgesic nephropathy is the cause of end-stage kidney disease

 Although these data may assume that analgesic nephrocyte has been eliminated in almost all areas, the situation is still not as good in some other areas

 Michelsen and De Scheper have suggested that the prevalence of analgesic nephropathy is not due to non-phenacetin analgesics among dialysis patients in Belgium, but because Belgium accepts a higher proportion of elderly patients for dialysis
 in lekhakon ke anusaar, peedaharak apvrikkata kaa anupaat adhik he kyonki belgium main un dialysis rogiyon kaa pratishat adhik he jo qi phenacetin kaa lambey samay tak upyag kiya he

 How phenacetin and other analgesics lead to this loss is far from understood
 vartmaan main yah mana jaataa he ki NSAID kii gurda sambandhi vishaaktataayen or jvaranashi phenacetin or paracitamol aapas main kriya karke peedaaharak nefropathy kaa nirmaan karte hai

 Kidney blood flow is a complex, controlled process that depends on many hormones and small molecules such as prostaglandin
 saamaanya paristhitiyon main, gurde dwaara utpaadit prostaglandin E2 gurde main paryaapt rakt pravaah ke liye aavashyak he
 Like prostaglandin, PGE 2 syntheses all depend on cyclooxygenases
 aspirin or anya NSAID cycluxijences nishedhak rahe hai
 In the kidney, this inhibition results in a decrease in the concentration of PGE 2 leading to decreased blood flow
 kyonki gurde main rakt sarvapratham vrikk praantastha main or phir gurde majja main pravaahit hoti he, isliye gurde kaa andruni bhaag rakt pravaah ke prati bada hi samvedansheel hota he

 Most healthy kidneys reserve adequate physiological reservations to compensate for the decrease in nsaid-induced blood flow
 haalanki, phenacetin yaa parasitamol se atirikt kshati hone par vah peedaaharak vrikkshoth kaa rup le sakati he
 It is not clear how phenacetin causes injury to the kidneys
 Beck and Hardy have proposed that phenacetin metabolites cause lipid peroxidation that damages kidney cells

 Common symptoms in patients with analgesic nephropathy include headache, anemia, hypertension, and white cells in the urine
 peedaaharak vrikkshoth se grasit kuch vyaktiyon ke mutr main protiyaan bhi ho sakati he
 The prognosis of this disease is traditionally determined by clinical discovery, based on findings based on excessive use of painkillers
 yah anumaan he ki 2 or 3 kilo aspirin yaa phenacetin ke seven ke baad hi peedaaharak vrikkshoth ke lakshan saamne aate hai| Once suspected, analgesic nephropathy can be confirmed with precision by tomography

 Treatment of analgesic nephropathy begins with discontinuation of painkillers, which often prevents the disease from progressing and may also bring the kidney back to normal
