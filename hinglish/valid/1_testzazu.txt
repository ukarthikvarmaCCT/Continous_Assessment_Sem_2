 Many problems of this book have not yet been accepted universally, yet Christian lecturers often agree that the following religious teaching is given in the book of Genesis
 yadhyapi utpati pustak kii rachanastyli par sumeri-babuli mahakavy enma-elish tathaa gilgamesh kii gahari chhap he or uske pratham rachayita ne usamen apane se pehle prachlit saamagree kaa upyog kiya he jiskaa udgam sthaan mesopotemia mana jaataa he, tathaapi uttapati pustak kii mukhya dharmik shiksha moulik hi he
 The influence of Moses on the composition of that book seems to be the most important, but it is clear from his mixed style that many writers have tried to mold that ancient material into a new structure, influenced by the latter circumstances after Moses

 Persian is the language of the country of Iran, but its name is Persian because the inhabitants of Persia, which is actually the name of a province of Iran, first made political progress

 In this, Christian, Jews, Muslims, religions have objected to the objections of Zoroastrianism

 Along with them, Persian language and literature also started to progress

 Therefore, leaving them, we will consider the beginning of Persian literature from the common era itself

 Its surname is Rudki, which is derived from his village name

 unheen dinon dharm ne bail kaa rup bana kar gaurupini prithvi se saraswati tat par bhent kiya
 Gaurupini was tearing through the eyes of the earth and it seemed to be Shrihin
 dharm ne prithvi se poocha - "he devi! tumhaara mukh malin kyon ho rahaa he? kis baat kii tumhen chintaa he? kahin tum meri chintaa to nahin kar rahi ho ki ab meraa keval ek pair hi rah gaya he yaa phir tumhen is baat kii chintaa he ki ab tum par shudra rajya karenge?" Prithvi said - "O religion! You, despite being omniscient, ask me the reason for my grief! Truth, purity, forgiveness, mercy, contentment, renunciation, sham, dum, tenacity, simplicity, ability, scriptural consideration, overhead, learning, knowledge Contains qualities like quietness, valor, sharpness, opulence, force, memory, talent, skill, freedom, boldness, tenderness, patience, courage, modesty, humility, good luck, enthusiasm, seriousness, fame, faithfulness, stability, pride, egolessness etc

 " jab dharm or prithvi ye baaten kar hi rahe the ki mukutadhaari shudra ke rup main kaliyug vahaan aayaa or un donon ko maarane laga
 King Parikshit was passing by while doing Digvijay
 unhone mukutadhaari shudra ko haath main danda liye ek gaay or ek bail ko buree tarah peetate dekha
 The bull was very beautiful, it was white and had only one leg
 gaay bhi kamdhenu ke samaan sundar thi
 Both were shivering in fear
 maharaj parakshit apane dhanushwan ko chadhaakar megh ke samaan gambheer vaani main lalakaare - "re dusht! paapi! naradham! tu koun he? in nirih gaay tathaa bail kyon sata rahaa he? tu mahaan apradhi he
 The only punishment for your crime is your slaughter
 " unke in vachanon ko sun kar kaliyug bhay se kaanpane laga
 The Maharaj asked the bull that, o ox, your three legs are broken
 tum bail ho yaa koi devtaa ho
 Hey Dhenuputra! You tell me your own account fearlessly
 he gaumata! ab tum bhaymukt ho jaao
 i punish the wicked
 kis dusht ne mere rajya main ghor paap kar ke pandavon kii pavitra kirti main yah kalank lagaaya he? chaahe vah paapi saakshaat devtaa hi kyon na ho main uske bhi haath kaat doongaa
 Then Dharma said - "O Maharaj! You are born in the clan of the Pandavas, the supreme devotees of Lord Krishna, so these words are worthy of you
 he rajan! ham yah nahin jaanate ki sansar ke jeevon ko koun klesh detaa he
 It has been described in many ways in the scriptures as well
 jo dwait ko nahin maanata vah dukh kaa kaaran apane aap ko hi sweekaar karata hai
 One considers destiny as the cause of sorrow and one considers karma as the cause of sorrow
 katipay vidwaan swabhaav ko or katipay ishwar ko bhi dukh kaa kaaran maanate hai
 So, o Rajan! Now you decide who is the cause of the misery
 " On hearing the words of the bull, the Emperor Parikshit said - "O Taurus! You are definitely a religion in the form of a bull and this cow god is Prithvi Mata
 aap dharm ke marm ko bhalee-bhanti jaanate hai
 You can not cheat anyone, that is why you are not giving the name of the person who is suffering

 The evil sinful Shudra kings will enjoy this beautiful land due to Lord Srikrishna Chandra's own movement, that is why this mother is also sad
 " Saying so, King Parikshit took out his sharp-edged sword to kill that sinful Shudra royalty Kali Yuga
 kaliyug ne bhaybheet hokar apane rajasi vesh ko utaar kar raja parakshit ke charnon main gir gaya or traahi-traahi kehane laga
 King Parikshit was a great refugee Vatsal, he did not think it appropriate to kill the Kaliyuga who came in the shelter and said to the Kaliyuga - "O Kaliyuga! You have come to my shelter, so i gave you my life
 kintu adharm, paap, jhooth, chori, kapat, daridrata aadi anek updravon kaa mul kaaran keval tu hi he
 Therefore, leave my kingdom immediately and do not come back again
 " Hearing these words of King Parikshit, Kali Yuga said in a Katar voice - "O Rajan! Your kingdom is on the whole earth, there is no place outside my kingdom where i can reside
 he bhupati! aap bade dayaalu hai, aapane mujhe sharan diya he
 Now you have to manage some kind of my residence with mercy
 " When Kali Yuga said this, King Parikshit got into thinking
 phir vichaar kar ke unhone kaha - "he kaliyug! dyut, madhpan, parastrigaman or hinsa in chaar sthanon main asaty, mad, kaam or krodh kaa nivas hota he
 i allow you to live in these four places
 " is par kaliyug bolaa - "he uttaranandan! ye chaar sthaan mere nivas ke liye aparyaapt hai
 Please give me some other place of mercy
 " kaliyug ke is prakaar maangane par raja parakshit ne use paanchava sthaan 'swarna' diya
 Kali Yuga went away from there after meeting these places, but after going some distance, he came back in an invisible form and resided in the golden crown of King Parikshit
 iske baad parikshit shikaar ke liye bahut bhatke or bhukh or pyaas ke maare unka bura haal tha 
 Losing weary in the evening, he reached the ashram of Shamik Rishi and at that time the sage was absorbed in the Brahmin Samaghi
 
 Parikshit said that we are thirsty we need water, there is no one here, are you listening, we are talking about the king, we are thirsty, we need water, you do not hear whether the sage was a Brahmin in the tomb at that time
 - Three times asked for water but the sage's house was not broken
 
 Kaliyuga sitting in Rajmukut got inspired by his true wisdom and decided to punish the sage
 parantu raja ke achche sanskaro ke kaaran unhonen apane-aap ko us paap se roak liya 
 In a fit of rage, he put the dead snake around the sage
 us shamik rishi kaa putr shringi bada hi tejasvi tha us samay vah nadi main naha rahaa tha
 The second sage Kumaro went and narrated the whole ritual

 From the time of Bajirao I, 'shinde' and 'holkar' were the two major pillars of the Maratha Empire
 ranoji scindia evam malharav holkar shivaji maharaj ke sarvapramukh saradaaron main se the, lekin in donon pariwaron kaa bhavishya saamaanya sthiti vaala nahin rah paaya
 All the successors of Ranoji Shinde were well qualified while the family situation of Malharrao Holkar became unfortunate
 unke putr khanderao ke durbhagyapurna ant ke pashchaat ahilyabai holkar ke stri tathaa bhakthibhaav purna mahila hone se dwaidh shashan sthapit ho gaya
 The capital had Ahilyabai Holkar as the nominal ruler and appointed Tukoji Holkar as the chief executive officer for military operations

 Ahilyabai was more busy in devotion and charity and could not pay special attention to upgrade the army according to the time requirements
 tukoji holkar atyadhik mahatvakankshi parantu aviveki vyakti tha
 Initially he was an ally with Mahadji in Maratha campaigns
 tab tak uski sthiti bhi apekshaakrit sudrudh rahi
 The defeat of the British army between Bargaon and Talegaon by Peshwa Madhavrao Narayana, the surrender of Raghunathrao and Tukoji Holkar with Mahadji in the victory of the Marathas was also a small but satisfactory part

 ahilyabai ne tukoji ko padchyut karne kaa bhi praytn kiya parantu unke parivaar main koi anya vyakti aisa tha bhi nahin jo ki sena kaa niyantran sambhaal saktaa
 Thus, Ahilyabai remained in control of the treasury and Tukoji Holkar faced starvation in military campaigns

 Although the agreement was reached with the efforts of Bapuji Holkar and Parashar Pant, Ahilyabai in Indore and Malharrao II, the prodigal son of Tukoji, found it humiliating
 bahari duniya se anbhigya hone ke kaaran ahilyabai ne malharav ke ran main adhikarpurvak jane dene ke uddhat prastaav ko manjuuri de di
 He reached the camp of his father with the army and money he wanted, and in violation of the agreement and consultation of Bapuji and Parashar Pant, started an attack on the scattered horsemen of Mahadji
