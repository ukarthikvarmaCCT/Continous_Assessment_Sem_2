 gandhiji ne 23 oktober 1937 ko 'nayi talim' kii yojana banaayi jise rashtravyapee vyaavhaarik rup diya janaa tha
 Their educational ideas did not match the views of the academicians, so their ideas were initially opposed
 gandhiji ne kaha tha ki nayi talim kaa vichaar bharat ke liye unka antim evam sarvshereshth yogadan he
 Gandhiji's long brainstorming of ideas through active experiments for the exploration of truth and creation of the nation resulted in the emergence of a new training philosophy and process which not only gave India but a whole new human society

 After that, many aspects of his 'nai Talim' scheme were openly discussed

 Gandhiji considered basic education a means of social change
 ve ise shant saamaajik kranti kaa ek pramukh aadhaar maanate the
 He considered a major basis of social revolution by rebuilding the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of the individual
 ve vyakti ke shaareerik, maansik tathaa aadhyatmik pakshon ke punarnirmaan dwaara saamaajik kranti laana chaahate the
 He considered self-confidence and self-reliance as the basis of complete development of human beings
 ve shiksha ko prayek vyakti kaa janmasiddh adhikaar maanate the
 That is why he considered it necessary to give free and compulsory education to all the boys and girls of the age group of seven to fourteen
 bhartiya rashtriya congress ke haripur adhiveshan main buniyadi rashtriya shiksha yojana kii sweekruti ke baad san 1938 se hi buniyadi shiksha main anek prayog aarambh ho gaye the kintu ve alag alag or simit str par kiye gaye
 The Second World War broke out in 1939, when another difficulty was present
 congress mantrimandal ko raajnneetik kaarnon se istipha dena padaa
 They were expected to be instrumental in the development of basic education
 kintu unke istife ke parinamswaroop, kuch praanton main prayog bilkul band kar die gaye or anya praanton main prayog ke prati udaseenta dikhaai dene lagi
 Only after independence, basic education was seriously accepted as the national method of education
 buniyadi shiksha nirantar pragati karti rahi he kyonki basic skulon kii sankhya baraabar badhati rahi he
 But there has been a decrease in the growth rate of the number of basic schools compared to ordinary elementary and middle schools
 basic skulon main pravesh kaa jahaan tak sambandh he sthiti santoshjanak nahin rahi he
 The goal was to provide basic education for all boys and girls in the age group of 6 to 14 years in basic education
 kintu pratham do yojanaon main koi mahatvapurn pragati is shiksha main nahin hui
 During this period, the progress of the spread of basic education was not as much as that of the promotion of ordinary elementary education, although the progress of simple elementary education is also not satisfactory
 adhyaaapak shikshan kii sthiti bhi bilkul santoshjanak nahin he
 The 1960 AD report of the First National Seminar on the Education of Elementary Teachers in India and the recent 1963 AD report of the Committee on Plan Projects regarding Teacher Training proves that there are many errors in the teacher training program
 isamen na keval uchit evam yogya karmchaariyon, bhawanon, upkarnon or anya sthool sadhano kii kami rahi he balki aparyaapt paathya vishay or shikshan kii prabhaavaheen vidhi tathaa style kaa bhi dosha rahaa he
 There is no clear definition of basic education by which people generally agree
 buniyadi shiksha ke vaastavik mul tatv evam nishchit lakshya ke sambandh main bahut hi gadabadi dikhaai detii he
 Gandhiji envisaged a certain social order while formulating the principles of basic education
 vah utpaadak kaary ko shiksha kaa centre maanate the kintu vaastavik prayog main utpaadak kaary dwaara shiksha ke siddhant ke bhinn bhinn arth ho gaye hai
 Some academics, who claim to be followers of Gandhiji, insist on the actual production of usable goods in schools
 kuch logon kaa mat he ki iskaa arth khel vidhi dwaara shiksha ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 The question of self-sufficiency in basic education is even more controversial
 gandhi ji aatmanirbharta ko shiksha kaa vaastavik maapdand samajhate the
 By self-sufficiency, he meant that basic schools should be self-sufficient to the extent that teachers' salaries could be paid by selling goods produced by children in schools
 isliye aarambh main buniyadi shiksha ke samarthakon kaa bahut bada varg is baat kii aashaa karne laga ki yadi buniyadi shiksha ke liye samuchit vaataavaran paidaa kiya jaae to iskaa adhik maatra main kharch nikal jayega or avshesh kharch sarkaar de degi jisase basic skool dakshatapurvak chal sakenge
 But from experience this conjecture proved to be wrong
 bharat sarkaar ke shiksha mantralay dwaara niyukt pieres-lakhni samiti ne is samasya kaa adhyayan kiya or bataaya ki 1950-1951 main bihar main, jo buniyadi shiksha kaa pramukh pradesh samajha jaataa tha, koi bhi vidhyalay 41
09 pratishat se adhik swaavlambee nahin tha
 The basic school of Sevagram, which was under the guidance and supervision of Hindustani Talimi Sangh, was self-supporting by 63 percent
 isanan is disha main basic vidyalayon kii suchi main sarvapratham sthaan praapt karne kaa gaurav praapt kiya tha
 In the year 1949-1950, 100 basic schools of Bihar state, including 18 senior basic schools, were able to be self-supporting only 15 percent
 tab se saadhaaran taur se, paristhiti main achchhai kii ore koi parivartan nahin dikhaai detaa he
 The evaluation committee appointed by the Government of India at the end of the first five-year plan for basic education also reached the same conclusion
 bharat sarkaar ne 'buniyadi shiksha kii sankalpana' sheershak pustika main swaavlamban kaa ullekh tak nahin kiya
 Even Vinoba Bhave, the great nutrient of the ideals of Gandhism, now has the idea that the benefit of the sale of the goods produced by children should not be used to reduce the reasonable expenditure on education, but it should be given to the parents by which they should get their To compensate for the loss caused by not being able to benefit from the help of your children at work
 aisa lagata he, sarkaar bhi siddhant rup se yah sweekaar karti he ki bacchon ke utpaadak kaaryan se praapt laabh unheen ke hit main kharch kiya jaae, jaise vidhyalay ke paridhaan yaa madhyanh ke bhojan ke prabandh par
 Therefore, it can be concluded that as per Gandhi's imagination, the cost of basic education cannot be reduced to a large extent by starting productive businesses in basic schools
 isliye buniyadi shiksha ko yadi desh bhar main praarambhik shiksha kii saarvbhaum paddati bananaa ho to iske liye prachur maatra main badhaai gai arthvyavastha aavashyak he
 The question of making basic education universal should be considered at the level of reality
 bharat ne samaajawaadee adarshavaale samaaj kii sthapana kaa sankalp kiya he
 One of the essentials of such a society is that all its members are well-educated so that they can contribute more and more to the common interest and properly benefit from the fruits of their combined efforts
 isliye kam se kam samay ke andar saarvbhaum, ni:shulk or anivaary shikshapradaan kaa prabandh sabase pehle hona chahie
 According to the 45th section of the constitution, by 1960 AD, the free and compulsory education of all children in the age of 14 years should have been arranged by the state
 yah ek vishaal samasya he or iske samaadhaan ke liye maanviya or bhautik donon prakaar ke mahan sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he
 It is estimated that if the country spends only two percent of its national income on elementary education, the necessary resources can be obtained in such a quantity that all the children of 14 years of age can get education facilities from 1980 to 1981
 ab yadi buniyadi shiksha sabhi bacchon ko di jaae to saarvbhaum shiksha ke str tak pahunchne main bahut adhik samay lagegaa
 Basic education is more expensive due to its high quality
 buniyadi shiksha kii rashtriya samiti dwaara niyukt sahaayak samiti kii siforeeshon se spasht he ki ek saadhaaran praarambhik vidhyalay ko basic skool main parivartit karne main kam se kam jitne sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he unhen dhyaan main rakhte hue praarambhik shiksha ke saath saath hi buniyadi shiksha kaa vikaas hona aavashyak prathit hota he
 The need is that a visionary plan should be made according to which the expansion of basic education should be equal so that in the end it will develop into an improved method of elementary education at the national level
 kuch baaten jinke karne kii aavashyaktaa he, neeche prastaavit kii jaati hai : Basic schools working on traditional principles should be made true basic schools, at least fulfilling the mandatory conditions
 jin vidyalayon kaa purna vikaas nahin ho sakaa he unako adhik se adhik sahaayta deni chahie taaki ve adarsh basic skool ban saken or duusare unka anukaran karen
 Continue to expand the expansion of basic education
 saadhaaran vidyalayon ko basic skulon main badalen or nae basic skool kholen
 Most states may increase the number of basic schools by at least 5 percent per year
 basic skulon ke liye udyog chunate samay yah baat dhyaan main rakhni chahie ki udyog shaksha kii drushti se samrudh hon tathaa saamaajik vaataavaran or bacchon kii avasthaa ke anukool hon
 To prevent waste of raw materials, industry related work should not be done in the following categories of basic schools till the children are mature enough that they can use it profitably
 mitti kaa kaam, praarambhik bagwani yaa kuch kam kharchavaale haath ke kaam neeche kii kakshaon main karaae ja sakate hai
 There is a need to make changes in the curriculum of basic education on this basis
 sabhi praarambhik vidyalayon main buniyadi shiksha ke kuch tatv saraltapurvak apanaae ja sakate hai, jaise swasthya sambandhi kriyaayein, saamaajik seva ke kaarykram, saanskrithik kaaryaklap ityadi
 a school that has sufficient land and adequate irrigation facilities can undertake the production of fruits and vegetables
 yah aavashyak he ki jin vidyalayon main ye kriyaayein aarambh kii jaaen, unka bhalee bhanti niyojan kiya jaae or saath hi, unase puraa puraa shaikshik laabh uthaaya jaae
 Answer: The basic school should be considered as a branch of the multipurpose higher secondary school where emphasis should be placed on qualifying in the industry which a student has been pursuing from the basic school

 The state institution of education established in each state should study and research various problems of basic education
 rashtriya shaikshanik anusandhan or prashikshan parishad ko rashtriya str ke mahatv vaali samasyaon kaa anusandhan karnaa chahie
 The research should make the methodology comprehensible and accessible to the teacher

 Historians believe that at that time some human groups migrated from Asia and settled here

 After this, with a snow wall between Berinjia and Asia, a few thousand humans on Berinjia survived the terrible outbreak of the Ice Age without contact with other humans for almost 5,000 years

 albert oinstin kaa janm germany main wootemberg ke ek yahudee parivaar main hua
 His father was an engineer and salesman
 unki maan paulin oinstin thi
 Although Einstein had difficulty speaking initially, he topped the studies
 unki maatrubhaasha german thi or baad main unhone italvi or angreji bhi sikhi
 In 1880 his family moved to the city of Munich, where his father and uncle jointly opened a company called "electrotechnic Frébich J
 Einstein & See", which manufactured electrical appliances
 or isane munich ke Oktoberfest meley main pehali baar roshni kaa prabandh bhi kiya tha
 His family did not believe in Jewish religious traditions, and for this reason Einstein could go to Catholic school
 apni maan ke kehane par unhone sarangi bajaanaa siikhaa
 He did not like this and later abandoned it, but later he enjoyed Mozart's Sarangi music
 1894 main, unke pita kii company ko munich shahar main vidyut prakaash vyavastha ke liye aapurti karne kaa anubandh nahin mil sakaa
 Due to the loss, he had to sell his company
 vyapaar kii talash main, oinstin parivaar italy chale gaye, jahaan ve sabase pehle milan or phir kuch maheene baad pavia shahar main bas gayi
 Even after the family left for Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to complete his studies
 disambar 1894 ke ant main, unhone pavia main apane parivaar se milane italy kii yatra kii
 During his time in Italy, he wrote a short essay titled "examining the state of the ether in a magnetic field"
 apane puure jeevankaal main, oinstin ne saikadon kitaaben or lekh prakashit kiye
 He published more than 300 scientific and 150 non-scientific research papers
 1965 ke apane vyaakhyaan main, oppenheimar ne ullekh kiya ki oinstin ke praarambhik lekhan main kai trutiyon hoti thi jiske kaaran unke prakaashan main lagbhag das varshon kii deree ho chuki thi: " ek aadmi jiskaa trutiyon ko hi sahi karne main ek lanbaa samay lage, kitna mahaan hoga"
 Apart from his own work, he also collaborated with other scientists, including Bose Einstein statistics, Einstein refrigerator and many more
 
 Anus Mirabilis Papers is related to four articles that Einstein published in 1905 in a scientific journal called Onlen der Physik, which included photoelectric effects, Brownian motion, special relativism, and e = mc2
 in chaar lekhon ne aadhunik bhautikee kii neenv ke liye kaaphi yogadan diya he or antariksh, samay tathaa dravya par logo kii soch ko badla he
 These four papers are: san 1900 main onalen der physic ko prastut, oinstin ke pehla shodh-patr "keshika aakarshan" par tha
 It was published in 1901 with the title "extracts from capillary phenomena"
 1902-1903 main prakashit do patron main parmanuviya ghatana kii vyakhya, sankhyikeey ke madhyam se karne kaa prayaas kiya
 This paper formed the foundation for a 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian motion can be used as concrete evidence for the presence of molecules
 1903 or 1904 main unka shodh mukhya rup se, prasar ghatana par parimit parmaanu aakaar kaa asar par sambandhit rahe
 He expressed the principle of relativity
 jo ki harman minkovski ke anusaar antariksh se antariksh-samay ke bich baari-baari se parivartanheenata ke samanyikaran ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Other theories that Einstein coined and later proved to be correct included the principle of equality and the theory of temperate normalization of quantum numbers
 oinstin ke "chalit nikaayon ke bijli kaa gativigyaan par" shodh-patr 30 june 1905 ko purna hua or usee varsh kii 26 sitambar ko prakashit hua
 This establishes harmony between Maxwell's equation of electricity and magnetism and the theory of mechanics, after major changes in mechanics close to the speed of light
 yahi baad main oinstin ke saapekshata ke vishesh siddhant ke rup main janaa gaya
 The conclusion was that, in the time-space structure, the moving matter is seen as slow and narrow, when it is measured in the observer's frame
 is shodh-patr main yah bhi tark diya ki luminipheras ether kaa vichaar zarurat se zyaada tha
 In his paper on mass-energy equivalence, Einstein constructed e = mc2 from special relativity equations

 In a 1905 paper, Einstein explained that light itself is made up of local particles
 oinstin ke prakaash quanta pariklpana ko maiks plank or niles bor sahit lagbhag sabhi bhautikavidon, ne asweekaar kar diya
 This hypothesis was universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Mulliken's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and the Compton scattering measurements
 oinstin ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki aavriti kii prayek lahar, urja ke prayek photonon ke sangrah ke saath judaa hota he 
 He did not say more about this, because he was not sure how particles are related to waves

 From 1492 to 1502, this disease was not heard of
 1502 main, aisa mana gaya tha ki iske kaaran england ke henry aathven ke bade bhai yuva lekhak, prince of wales kii mrityu hui thi

 Its outbreak reached Switzerland in December, followed by Denmark, Sweden and Norway to the north and Lithuania, Poland and Russia to the east
 ise france yaa italy main kabhi mahasoos nahin kiya gaya
 It also emerged in Belgium and the Netherlands, probably because it was directly infected with England, its havoc was seen on the morning of 27 September in cities such as Antwerp and Amsterdam

 After this, it never reappeared on European soil
 is rog kaa antim pramukh prakope 1551 main england main saamne aayaa tha
 An eminent physician, John Sayce, has written a direct statement of the disease, which is commonly referred to as a bok or concel, against a disease commonly known as sweating or sweating
 sis or anya dwaara varnit kiye gaye lakshan or sanket is prakaar he: rog achaanak biimaar hone kii ashanka ke saath shuru hota he, uske baad thanda bukaar, chakkar, sirdard or thakaavat ke saath gardan, kandhaa or pair me atyadhik dard jaise lakshan dikhte hai
 After the cool state, which lasts for about half an hour to three hours, it starts to heat up and also starts sweating
 bina kisi spasht kaaran ke pasinaa aane lagata he
 Along with perspiration or perspiration, there was a feeling of heat, a headache, a frenzy, a pulse, and intense thirst
 ghabrahat or dil main dard saamaanya lakshan the
 No skin rash was noted by observers, including Sayes
 antim charan main, yaa to sarvangin tandra or nipaat hota tha yaa sone kii teevr ichha hoti thi, jo ki sis ke anusaar ghaatak ho saktaa tha, yadi rogi ko aisa karne kii anumati de di jaati
 ek aghat se rogakshmata main kami nahin aati thi, lekin kai logon ko mrityu se pehle kai aghaton ke kaaran atyadhik pidaa kaa saamana karata padataa tha
 The disease remained extinct in England until 1578, although a similar disease, known as Picardy perspiration, appeared in France between 1718 and 1861, but was not as fatal and was consistent with the rash, Which was not part of any symptoms of the initial outbreak
 rog kaa kaaran hi iskaa sabase rahasyamay pahalu he
 Then and today's commentators blame the common filth and feces of that time, which can be the source of infection

 However, Thomas Stanley, the first Earl of Derby, used the "sweat disease" as an excuse not to join the army of Richard III before Bosworth's war, making it clear that before Henry Tudor arrived The disease had spread in England
 rog ke garibon se zyada amiron ke bich failane ke kaaran ise us kaal ke dauraan hui anya bimariyon kii tulana main adhik jaharila qaraar diya gaya
 Recurring fever is considered a possible cause
 tik or juun dwaara failane vaala yah rog aksar garmiyon ke maheenon ke dauraan sabase zyada dekhe ja sakate hai, kyonki is dauraan pasinaa adhik aata he
 However, recurrent fever is characterized by permanent black spot scarring and subsequent skin rash at the site of a tick bite, while concurrent individuals were not able to see these relevant obvious signs, so its identification is far from certain
 maarak maansal pidaa ke prakope par 1934 ke lekh par aadhaarit choudhariya or behan dwaara sujhavit chirkaari thakaan sanglakshan bornhome rog ke nidaan ko saajha karti he
 More recently, a haunta virus has also been proposed and appears to be an interesting candidate to consider the etiology of the disease
 haalanki, hanta virus ke failane ke kuch chikitsiya suvidhaayen paseene kii beemaari ke vikaas main sahyogi nahin hai; vishesh rup se, jabaki hanta virus ke ek vyakti se duusare main sankramit hone kii bahut kam sambhaavna hoti he, phir bhi ise paseene kii beemaari ke sankraman kaa mahatvapurn kaarak mana jaataa he
 Although the diagnosis of the Hanta virus pulmonary syndrome outbreak is very similar to the description of the diagnosis of sweat disease, there are still many questions that need to be answered and it is for this reason that avenues are opened for the theory of etiology

 Through his stories, he raises questions about the destiny of man's isolation and loneliness and takes us to the boundary of the almost existential consciousness of human experience
 Here there is a profoundly diabolical discharge of social and personal emotions such as family isolation, depression, loneliness, suffocation, frustration, where the identities of modern-day life and identity are embodied before the reader
 Person, family, love, sexual, adolescent-psychology, home, body, woman, society, time-sense, creation process, mechanization, object-consciousness, are all seen here through deep absolutes and sentimental insights
 It is more objective and 'moments' to the narrative The storytellers are in favor of keeping focused, their faith and thinking is in the analysis of the 'present' in the 'story' and its psychological-mental expansion rather than the traditional narration of the story
 The time-frame in his story is a visual-centered time-sense in which there are no signs of the past, nor concern for the unseen future; That is the typical 'abhi' and 'here' story

 The NTSC, namely the National Television System Committee, is an analog television system used mostly in North America, South America, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Burma and some territories and nations of the Pacific Islands
 NTSC america kii us maanakeekaran sanstha kaa bhi naam he jisane prasaaran maanak kaa vikaas kiya he
 The first NTSC standard was developed in 1941 and there was no provision for color TV
 1953 main NTSC maanak ke ek duusaren sanshodhit sanskaran ko sweekrut kiya gaya tha, jisamen kaale or safed resovers ke maujuuda stock ke saath anukool rangeen prasaaran kii anumati thi
 NTSC was the first widely accepted color system to be widely accepted

 The National Television Systems Committee was established in 1940 by the United States Federal Communications Commission to resolve an ongoing dispute between companies over the universal presentation of analog television systems in the United States
 In March 1941, the committee issued a technical standard for black-and-white television based on a 1936 request made by the Radio Producers Committee
 alpaviksit cidband takanic ke takneekee abhyuday image rejolujan main vruddhi hetu avasar pradaan karte the
 The NTSC entered into an agreement and selected 525 scan lines as part of rca's desire to convert the 441 scan line standard and the Filco and Dumont scan lines from 605 to 800
 is maanak main prati second 30 frames kaa frem rate prastaavit he, jisamen prati field 262

 Other standards of decisive request were aspect ratio of 4: 3 and frequency modulation for sound signal

 In December 1953, the committee unanimously accepted it in what is now called the NTSC color television standard
 "anukool rang" maanak maujuuda kaale or safed televijan seton ke saath purna rup se becoward sangatta banaae rakhata he
 Color information was added to the black-and-white image by adding a 455 / 572 × 4

 The FCC approved a different color television standard that began in October 1950 and was developed by CBS
 haalanki, yah maanak blike-and-white prasaaran ke saath anukool nahin tha
 It used a recurring colored wheel, the number of scan lines was reduced from 525 to 405, and the field rate increased from 60 to 144
 Legal action by rival RCA kept commercial use of the system off air until June 1951 And regular broadcasting only lasted for a few months as the Korean War Department banned the manufacture of all color television sets in October
 Was given
 CBS ne march 1953 main apni is pranali ko nirast kar diya, tathaa FCC ne 17 disambar 1953 ko is pranali ko NTSC color standard se badal diya, jo RCA or philko sahit kai companiyon ke sahyog se viksit kiya gaya tha
 The first publicly announced network TV broadcast using the NTSC "friendly color" system was an episode of nbc's Kukla, Frn & Ollie program, although it could only be viewed in color at the network headquarters
 NTSC color kaa pehla rashtravyapee darshan rocess parade toornament ke tat dar tat prasaaran ke saath 1 janvari ko aayaa tha
 This broadcast could be seen by special presentations on prototype color receivers across the country
 pehla rangeen NTSC televijan camera RCA TK-40 tha jo 1953 main prayogtmak prasaaran ke liye upyog kiya gaya tha; iskaa ek unnat sanskaran TK-40A march main prastut hua tha, yah vanijyik rup se uplabdh pehla rangeen tivi camera tha
 Later that same year the modified TK-41 became the standard camera used in the 1960s
 NTSC maanak japan or america sahit anya adhikansh deshon dwaara apanaaya gaya he
 With the advent of digital television, analog broadcasts are ending

 The remainder are used for synchronization and vertical reflection
 yah rikt antaraal multah resiver CRT ko bas khaali karne ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha jisase saral analog circuit or purv tivi resiver ko dhimi urdhwadhar pratidhaav kii anumati de ja sake

 In the full raster, even-numbered or "short" scan lines) are drawn in the first region and odd numbered or "high") are drawn in the second region, from which the image flickers at a field refresh frequency of approximately 59
94 Hz
 To go For comparison, 576i systems such as PAL-B / g and SECAM use 625 lines, so their vertical resolution is high, but their time resolution is only 25 frames or 50 fields per second, which is low
 blike-and-white system kii NTSC field rifresh aavriti multah sanyukt rajya america main upyog hone vaale ekantar karant power kii nammaatr 60 hertz aavriti ke bilkul samaan he
 Matching the field refresh rate to the power source avoids intermodulation that causes rolling bars to be produced on the screen, later when the color was added to the system, the refresh frequency was shifted slightly down to 59
94 Hz causing sound and color Stable dot patterns can be eliminated at different frequencies between carriers, as explained in color coding below
 sanyogvash power ke saath rifresh rate kaa tulykaalan kinescop camaron ko purv sajiv televijan prasaaran ricard karne me madad karata he, kyonki ekantar karant aavriti kaa upyog karke prayek film frem par video kaa ek frem capchar karne ke liye ek film camere ko sincranaise karnaa bahut aasaan tha jisase tulykaalik AC motor drive camere kii gati ko set kiya ja sake
 samay ke saath rang ke liye frem dar 29
97 hertz ho gaya, yah lagbhag video signal se camere ke shater ko trigar karne jitna aasaan tha
 The number of 525 lines was chosen as a result of limitations of vacuum tube based techniques
 purv TV system main, ek master voltage-niyantrit dolak kshaitij rekha aavriti kii dugani aavriti par chalata tha or yah aavriti kshetra aavriti praapt karne ke liye upyog hone vaali linon kii sankhya dwaara vibhajit kii jaati thi)
 phir is aavriti kii tulana 60 hertz power-line aavriti ke saath kii jaati he or kisi bhi visangati ko master dolak kii aavriti ko samyojit karke sahi kiya jaataa he
 For interpolation scanning, an odd number of lines are required per frame to make the vertical reflection distance the same for even and odd areas; An additional odd line means that the distance traveled from the last odd line to the first odd line is the same distance that is set to return from the last odd line to the first odd line, thus simplifying the resonance circuitry
 
 500 ke sabase zyada kareebi vyaavhaarik anukram 3 × 5 × 5 × 7 = 525 tha
 Similarly, 625-line PAL-B / g and SECAM use 5 × 5 × 5 × 5
 british 405-line system xxwrep 7 3 × 5 kaa istemaal karte hai, french 819-line system kaa 3 × 3 × 7 × 13 kaa upyog karte hai
 The original 1953 color NTSC specification, which is still a part of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, defines the system's colorimetric values as follows: purv color televijan resiver jaise RCA CT-100 is vinirdesh ke liye vafaadaar the, inamen aajkal ke monitor kii tulana main zyada swar tha
 However their less efficient phosphorus was deeper and longer sustained, chasing moving objects
 1950 ke aakhri dashak main shuru hone vaale, pikchar tub phosphorus atyadhik chamak ke liye santrupti kaa balidaan karenge; maanak se yah vichlan resiver or prasarak donon simaayon par vichaarneey rang bhinnata kaa strot tha
 To ensure more uniform color reproduction, the receiver has begun incorporating color correction circuits that encode the received signal --- to the colorimetric values listed above --- for the phosphors actually used in the receiver
 Converts to
 chunki is tarah ke rang sudhaar preshit arekhiy signlles par sahi dhang se lagu nahin kiye ja sakate, isliye samaayojan kaa lagbhag anumaan hi laga sakate hai,jiske kaaran ucch-santrupt rangon main hae or luminans truti utpann ho jaati he
 Similarly on the broadcaster platform, in 1968–69 Konrak Corporation, which is working with RCA, defines a set of controlled phosphorus for use in broadcast color picture monitors
 yah vinirdesan SMPTE "C" fosfar vinirdesh ke rup main aaj bhi jivit he: Like home receivers, it was previously suggested that studio monitors incorporate similar color correction circuits so that the broadcaster would transmit the encoded images to the original 1953 colorimetric values according to the FCC standard
 1987 main, sosayadi of moshan pikchar and televijan ejiniers televijan praudyogiki par ek samiti, studio monitor varnmiti par kaary samiti, ne sanstuti abhyaas 145 main saamaanya upyog ke liye SMPTE c phosphorus ko sweekaar kar liya he, jisane kai nirmaataaon ko rang sudhaar kiye bina hi sidhe SMPTE "C" varnmiti hetu incode karne ke liye apane camere dizin ko sanshodhit karne ke liye utsahit kiya hai, jaisaa ki SMPTE maanak 170M, "mishrit analog video signal---studio anuprayog hetu NTSC" main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 As a result, the ATSC Digital TV standard has clarified that for 480i signals, SMPTE "C" colorimetry must be accepted until colorimetric data is included in the transport stream
 japani NTSC laal, nile or hare rang ke liye samaan varnmiti mulyon kaa upyog karata he, lekin CIE pradeepak D93 ke ek alag safed drushtikon kaa upyog karata he
 By 1970 PAL and SECAM systems both used the original 1953 NTSC colorimetry, however unlike NTSC, in 1970 the European Broadcasting Union receiver removed color correction from receivers and studios and instead used "EBU" colorimetric values for all devices
 It was considered appropriate to encode the signals directly, which further modified the color fidelity of these systems
 blike-and-white televijan ke saath becoward sangatta ke liye, NTSC luminans-chrominance kutabandhan pranali kaa upyog karata he jiskaa avishkaar 1938 main gorgess valency ne kiya tha
 Luminance replaces the original monochrome signal
 chrominance main rang se sambandhit jaankaree hoti he
 This allows black-and-white receivers to display NTSC signals by ignoring chrominance
 NTSC main, chrominance do 3
579545 megahertj signlles kaa upyog karke incode hota he yah signlles 90 degree phej ke baahar hote hai, inhen i tathaa q QAM kehete hai
 These two signals are amplitude modulated and then added together
 karier ko dabaa diya jaataa he
 Mathematically, as a result you can see a single sine wave with different phase
 phej ek tivi camere dwaara capchar kiye gaye taatkaalik rang hae ko pradarshit karata he or aayam taatkaalik rang santrupti ko pradarshit karata he
 To retrieve information from the i / q phase, the TV must have a suppressed carrier to replace the zero phase reference
 ise santrupti jaankaree ko praapt karne ke liye aayam hetu ek sandarbh kii bhi jarurat hoti he
 Hence, the NTSC signal has a small sample of this reference signal, called the color burst, which is located on the 'back porch' of each horizontal line
 Color Burst consists of a minimum of eight cycles of unmodulated color subcarriers
 tivi resiver ke paas ek "sthaneey dolak" hota he jise vah color barst ke saath synchronise karata he tathaa phir chrominance ko dicode karne ke liye ise sandarbh kii tarah upyog karata he
 By comparing the amplitude and phase of the reference signal and chrominance signal from the color burst at a particular point in a raster scan, the device determines what chrominance will be displayed at that point
 By combining with the amplitude of the luminance signal, the receiver calculates which color is required to produce this point, ie the point with the instantaneous position of the continuous scanning beam
 dhyaan den ki analog tivi urdhwadhar aayam main bhinn he, lekin kshaitij aayam main nirantar he, isliye analog tivi main pixel nahin hote he
 When a transmitter transmits an NTSC signal, this amplitude modulates the radio frequency carrier with the recently described NTSC, while it modulates the carrier 4
5 mhz high with the frequency audio signal
 agar araikhik virupan signal prasaarit karne ke liye hota he, 3
579545 megahertz rang karier screen par dot pattern kaa utpaadan karne ke liye sound karier ke saath takaraa saktaa he
 To make the resulting pattern less noticeable, the designer has adjusted the original field rate of 60 Hz by about 1
001 to 59
94 fields per second
 yah samaayojan sunishchit karata he ki sound karier or color sabakarier or unke gunaj kaa jod or antar frem rate kaa sateek gunaj nahin he, jo screen par dots ke sthir rahane ke liye mahatvapurn aavashyaktaa he, jo inhen zyada dhyaan dene yogya banaati he
 The 59
94 rate is derived from the following calculation
 diziner chrominance sabakarier aavriti ko line aavriti kaa n +0
5 gunaj bananaa pasand karte he jisase chrominance signal or luminans signal ke madhya hastkshep ko kam se kam ho sake
 phir ve audio sabakarier aavriti ko rekha aavriti kaa ek purnank gunaj banaate he jisase audio signal or chrominance signal ke madhya spasht hastkshep ko kam se kam kiya ja sake
 15750 hertz rekha aavriti or 4
5 megahertz audio sabakarier ke saath mul blike-and-white maanak in aavashyaktaaon ko puraa nahin karata he, at: dizinron ko yaa to audio sabakarier aavriti badhaani padati he yaa rekha aavriti ko kam karnaa padataa he
 Increasing the audio subcarrier frequency may prevent the current receiver from tuning properly to the audio signal
 rekha aavriti kam karnaa apekshaakrit ahaanikar he, kyonki NTSC signal main kshaitij or urdhwadhar tulykaalan soochna ek resiver ko rekha aavriti main vividhta kii ek paryaapt maatra sahan karne kii anumati detii he
 Engineers therefore choose to change the line frequency to the color standard
 mul blike-and-white maanak main, audio sabakarier aavriti kaa rekha aavriti se anupaat 4
5 megahertz / 15750 = 285
71 he
 In the color standard, this becomes approximately 286 integers, meaning that the color standard's line rate is 4
5 mhz / 286 = approximately 15,734 lines per second
 prati field scan line kii samaan sankhya banaae rakhane ke liye, kam pankti dar kam field dar detaa he
 Lines per second divided by 262
5 lines per field yield approximately 59
94 fields per second
 NTSC televijan channel prasaarit hone par kul 6 megahertz kii bandwidth par kabza karata he
 The actual video signal, which is amplitude-modifier, is transmitted between 500 khz and 5
45 mhz above the lower bound of the channel
 video karier channel kii lower bound ke upar 1
25 megahertz he
 Like most AM signals, the video carrier produces two sidebands, one above the carrier and one below
 prayek cidband 4
2 megahertz vyapak hota hai
 The entire upper sideband is transmitted, but only 1
25 mhz of the lower sideband, called the vestigial sideband, is transmitted
 rang sabakarier, jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he, video karier ke upar 3
579545 megahertz he, se upar he or yah quadrechar-aayam-aaparivartan ke saath dabaa hua karier he
 The audio signal is frequency-modifying, such as audio signals transmitted by FM radio stations over the 88–108 mhz band, but with + / - 25 khz maximum frequency swing, as opposed to 75 khz as used on the FM band
 mukhya audio karier video karier ke upar 4
5 megahertz he, jo ise channel ke sheersh ke neeche 250 khz banaata he
 Sometimes a channel contains an MTS signal, which provides more than one audio signal by adding one or two subcarriers to the audio signal, with each line synchronized to a multiple of the frequency
 saamaanya rup se yah vahi cese he jab sterio audio or / yaa doosraa audio kaarykram signlles kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Similar extensions are used in ATSC, where ATSC is broadcast at 1
31 mhz above the lower bound of the digital carrier channel
 Cvbs "kaale" or "rikt" str ke madhya ek voltage ofaset he

 There is a big difference in framerate between the film running at 24
0 frames per second and the NTSC standard, which runs at around 29
97 frames per second
 576i video praroopon ke vipareet yah antar saral rup se gati badhaakar khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa
 a complex process called "3: 2 pulldown" is used
 ek film frem teen video fields ke liye prasaarit hota he or aglaa frem do video fields ke liye prasaarit hota he
 Therefore two 24 frame / s film frame fives are transmitted in 60 Hz video fields, the average value being 21⁄2 video fields per film frame
 ausat frem dar 60 / 2
5 = 24 frem / s he,isliye ausat film kii gati bilkul vahi he jo honi chahie
 haalanki, yahaan kamiyaan hai
 However, on playback, framing can display video frames with fields from two different film frames, so any movement between frames will appear as a rapid back and forth flicker
 Slow camera / noticeable during camera pans There may be "rattle"
 3:2 puldown se bachane ke liye, film shot vishesh rup se NTSC televijan ke liye aksar 30 frem / s liya jaataa he
 To view original 576i content on NTSC equipment there should be standard conversion
 There are basically two ways to achieve this
 kyonki upgrah shakti gambhir rup se simit he isliye upgrahon ke madhyam se analog video prasaaran sthaliy tivi prasaaran se alag he
 AM is a linear modulation method, so a demodulated signal-to-noise ratio requires an equally high RF SNR
 studio gunvattta vaale video kaa SNR 50 db se bhi upar he, isliye AM ko nishedhaatmak dhang se ucch shaktiyon or / yaa bade antina kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Wideband FM is used instead of changing the RF bandwidth for low power
 channel bandwidth ko 6 se 36 megahertz tak badhanakeval 10 db yaa usase kam RF SNR kii anumati detaa he
 The wider noise bandwidth reduces this 40 db power saving to 36 mhz / 6 mhz = 8 db for a significant net reduction of 32 DB
 sthaliy prasaaran kii tarah dhwani FM sabakarier par he, lekin 4
5 megahertz se upar aavritiyon ko karn / drishy ched-chhaad kam karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Unrelated audio and data signals may be placed on additional subcarriers
 ek trikoniya 60 hertz urja vitaran tarang ko adhimishran se pehle samgr besaband signal main joda jaataa he
 This satellite power limits the spectral density if the video signal is lost
 anyathaa upgrah apni sari shakti ko samaan aavriti band main sthaliy microwave link ke saath hastkshep karte hue ek hi aavriti par sanchaarit kar saktaa he
 In half-transponder mode, the frequency deviation of the overall baseband signal is reduced to 18 mhz to allow other signals in the other half of the 36 mhz transponder
 This reduces the FM gain to some extent and the recaptured snrs are further reduced because the combined signal power must be "repelled" to avoid intermittent distortion in satellite transponders
 If a single FM signal has a constant amplitude, it can dampen a transponder without distortion
 ek NTSC 'frem' main 'visham' field kaa anusaran karte hue 'sam' field ko sammilit kiya jaataa he
 As far as the capture of an analog signal is concerned, it is purely a matter of agreement and it does not matter
 vastav main isse koi fark nahin padataa ki vah ek rekha / antariksh jodi yaa ek antariksh / rekha jodi he, ek driver ke liye prabhaav bilkul ek jaisaa hota he
 The introduction of digital television formats has changed the facts a bit
 zyaadaatar digital tivi praaroop, lokapriy DVD praaroop ko sammilit karte hue, sabase pehle recordid frem main sam field ke saath NTSC dwaara utpann video ko record karte hai ke madhyam se sthanantarit ho gaya he, is parinaam ke saath ki sam field aksar frem main pehle record hote hai kaa nirmaan hota hai to yah aavashyak he ki field aadesh ko vipareet kar diya jaye anyathaa gatiman vastuon par ek asweekaarya siharan 'comb' prabhaav padataa he kyoki ve aage ek field main dikhaae jate hai or phir waapas agle par kud jate hai
 It poses a danger where non-ntsc progressive video is transcoded in the sequence of interconnection or vice versa
 system jo pragatisheel frames ko pun: praapt karte he yaa video ko transcode karte hai unhen yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki 'field aadesh' mana ja rahaa he, anyathaa baraamad frem ke paas ek field kaa ek frem or nikatavarti frem se ek field hoga, jiske parinamswaroop 'comb' antarvayan shilpakruti utpann hogi
 agar ek anuchit di-interlacing elgorithm kaa chayan kiya jaataa he to ise aap aksar PC aadhaarit video khel suvidhaon main dekh sakate hai
 Capture problems can damage the NTSC picture by changing the phase of the color signal, so that the color balance of the picture will keep changing until the receiver is compensated
 This requires the inclusion of tint control on NTSC sets, which is not required on pal or SECAM systems
 vishisht rup se PAL kii tulana main, NTSC kii rang sateekta or sthirataa kaaphi kam he, jiske kaaran televijan ejeeniyar or video vyavsaayee NTSC ko majaak main nevar di saim color, nevar tawayees di saim color athwa no tru skin color kehete hai
 This allows anyone skilled in color phase, "tint", or "color" control art to easily calibrate monitors with SMPTE color bars, even with a set that allows for proper color display Be swept away in your color display
 S-video systams main NTSC coded color kaa upyog puri tarah se phej vikrutiyon ko khatm kar detaa he
 As a result, NTSC color encoding provides the highest resolution picture quality of a three color system when used with this scheme
 NTSC ke 30 frem prati second or film ke 24 frem prati second ke madhya anupyukt mail ko ek aisi prakriya dwaara thik kar sakate he jo antarvayan NTSC signal ke field rate par laabh uthaaye, is prakaar 25 frames prati second par video main kuch jarkiness ke saath 576i systams ke liye upyog hone vaale film plabac spiciap ko andekha kar sakate hai 
 upar fremerat roopantaran dekhen Unlike PAL, many of its various built-in broadcast television systems are in use around the world, the NTSC color encoding broadcast system is in stable use with M, and provides NTSC-M
 keval japan kaa vibhed "NTSC-J" thodaa alag he: japan main signal kaa kaala str or rikt str samaan hota he kyonki ve PAL main hote hai, jabaki america NTSC main kaala str rikt str se kii tulana main thodaa adhik he chunki antar kaaphi chota he isliye kisi anya set par sahi prakaar se NTSC ke "anya" vibhed dikhaane ke liye chamak kii ghundi ko halkaa sa ghumana hi kaaphi he kyonki yah mana jaataa he ki bahut se darshak pehali baar main bhi antar notice nahin kar pate
 The PAL-M system uses the same broadcast bandwidth, frame rate, number of lines as NTSC, but PAL uses color encoding
 isliye yah aanshik rup se ntsc-sangat he
 NTSC-M TV sets can receive terrestrial PAL-M broadcasts, NTSC vcrs can also play videotapes recorded in PAL-M and vice versa, but only in black and white because color information cannot be decoded
 ise urugve or paragway main prayog kiya jaataa he
 It is very similar to PAL-M

 Although nothing is known about the death of the poet, the time of the last event described in "chhatraprakash" is no
 Assuming 1764 V
 Mishrabandhu and Ramchandra Shukla etc
 have miscalculated the death of the poet at the same time, while the last mentioned event in the available copy of the said work is "lohagarh, Vijay", whose time is no
 1767 v
 isliye kavi kaa nidhan san

 Many compositions of Lal Kavi are told - "chhatraprashti", "chhatrachaya", "chhatrakirti", "chhatrachand", "chhatrasalashtak", "chhatrahajara", "chhatradand", "chhatraprakash", "rajavinod" Barabe etc
 kintu inamen ekmaatr prapya or mahatv kii rachana chatraprakash hi he
 It is known from the name of the compositions that the poet was so lax on the qualities of his charitnayak that whatever he wrote as much as "chhatra"
 "chatraprakash" kii ginati viraras ke anuthe kavyagranthon main kii jaati he
 It was composed with the permission of Maharaja Chhatrasal
 "chatraprakash" kaa sarvapratham prakaashan kalkatte ke fort wiliam kalege se major price dwaara kiya gaya tha, lekin vah prati ab prapya nahin

 aitihaasik satya kii suraksha ke prati kavi kii gahari nishtha dikhaai padati he
 With little use of art and imagination, which makes the truth of the events quite blurred and dull, the descriptions of "chhatraprakash" have become fact-filled and chronological
 isaki aitihaasik mahatta se aakarshith hokar hi captain pawasan ne iskaa ulth angreji main kiya tha
 Lal's mastery of the idea of poetry is reprehensible
 ve katha kaa sambandhnirvaah bhi khub jaanate hai or maarmik sthalon kaa chunaav bhi
 Takaar, Dakaradi depilatory characters have been used for virarasodrake on a very natural method
 kavi kii drushti jitani ghatnavarnan kii ore rahati he utani raschithran kii ore nahin; phir bhi bhaavon ko samuchit utkarsh mila he
 On the contrary, the combination of the mention of names of many persons, narration-detail-love and chivalry, etc
, at a slight difference in the battleship, has made its poetic plausibility dull and faded
 bhashaa uski brajabhasha he jisamen bundeli kii acchhee milawat he
 Jowar is a major crop
 jowar kam varsha vaale kshetra main anaaj tathaa chaara donon ke liye boi jaati hai
 Jowar is an important and nutritious fodder for animals
 bharat main yah fasal lagbhag sava chaar karod acre bhoomi main boi jaati he
 It is one of the main kharif crops
 yah ek prakaar kii ghaas he jisaki bali ke dane mote anaajon main gine jate hai
 It is sown before irrigation and before the rain starts
 yadi barsaat se pehle sinchai karke yah bo di jaae, to fasal or jaldi taiyaar ho jaati he, parantu barsaat jab acchhee tarah ho jaae tabhi iskaa chaara pashuon ko khilaanaa chahie
 In the summer, some poison is produced in its crop, so feeding before the rain can have a very bad effect on the animal
 yah vish barsaat main nahin rah jaataa he
 More seed is sown for fodder, about 12 to 15 ser per acre
 ise ghanaa bone se haraa chaara patala evam naram rahata he or use katkar gaay tathaa belon ko khilaayaa jaataa he
 In the crop that is sown for grain, only eight ser seeds per acre are added
 dana oktober ke ant tak pak jaataa he bhutte lagane ke baad ek maheene tak isaki chidiyon se badi rakhwali kerani padati he
 When the grains are cooked then the corn is cut apart and the grains are removed
 isaki ausat paidaavaar chah se aath man prati acre ho jaati he
 a good crop yields 15 to 20 mana per acre of grain
 dana nikaal lene ke baad lagbhag 100 man prati acre sookhaa paushtik chaara bhi paidaa hota he, jo baarik katkar jaanwaron ko khilaayaa jaataa he
 Jowar stalks and leaves are considered to be the best fodder after wheat straw in dry four
 yah anaaj sansar ke bahut se bhaagon main hota he
 It is cultivated in India, China, Arabia, Africa, America etc
 jowar sookhe sthanon main adhik hoti he, seed liye hue sthanon main utani nahin ho sakati
 In India, it is very common in Rajasthan, Punjab etc
 bengal, madras, barma aadi main jowar bahut kam boi jaati he
 Even if sowing is done, the grains do not grow well
 iskaa paudha narkat kii tarah ek danthal ke rup main sidhaa 5-6 haath unchaa jaataa he
 The stalk consists of knots on seven seven eight eight fingers from which two and a half cubits long leaves shaped like a sword
 iske sire par phool ke jire or safed daanon ke guchchhe lagate hai
 These grains are small and are used for eating like wheat
 jowar kai prakaar kii hoti he jinke paudhon main koi vishesh bhed nahin dikhaai padataa
 Jowar crops are of two types, one is rabi and the other is kharif
 makka bhi isi kaa ek bhed he
 In addition to this, maize is also called jowar
 jowar ko jonhari, jundi aadi bhi kehete hai
 Its stalks and plants are used as fodder and are called 'chari'
 is ann ke utpattisthaan ke sambandh main matbhed he
 Some people believe that it comes from Arab and Western countries and the word 'jowar' is derived from Arabic 'dura', but this opinion does not seem to be right
 jowar kii kheti bharat main bahut pracheen kaal se hoti ai he
 But it was sown for fodder, not for food

 After the fundamentalist policies of zia-ul-haq in Pakistan were reduced, the use of this unrelated word was reduced there and the emphasis was on using the word 'allah' more

 Anaerobic organisms can be unicellular - such as bacteria and protozoa - or multicellular
 aamtaur par avayaviya jeevon ko teen shreniyon main baanta jaataa he: After nearly half a century of turmoil and honor at the hands of the Shaka rulers, Gautami reestablished his lost reputation under the leadership of son Shatkarni
 gautami putr shri shatakarni satvaahan vansh kaa sabase mahaan shaasha tha jisane lagbhag 25 varshon tak shashan karte hue na keval apane samrajya kii khoi pratishtha ko purnsthapit kiya apitu ek vishaal samrajya kii bhi sthapana kii
 In the time of Gautami's son and his victories, we get complete information from the Nashik inscriptions of his mother Gautami Balashree
 uske sandarbh main hamen is lekh se yah jaankaree milti he ki usne kshatriyon ke ahankaar kaa maan-mardan kiya tha
 He is described as the doer of the rulers of Shaka, Yavana and Pahlavas
 uski sabase badi uplabdhi kshahraat vansh ke shaq shaasha nahpaan tathaa uske vanshajon kii uske haathon hui paraajay thi
 The silver coins of Nahapan obtained from the Jogalthambi group which Gautami's son Shatkarni reintroduced and in the eighteenth year of his reign, by Gautami's son making a cavity at Pandu-lan near Nashik - these are some of the facts that prove that he Rejuvenated the territories taken away by the Shaka rulers
 nahpaan ke saath unka yuddh uske shashan kaal ke 17wein or 18wein varsh main hua tathaa is yuddh main jeet kar rgatmi putr ne aparant, anup, saurashtra, cooker, akar tathaa avanti ko nahpaan se chin liya
 Apart from these areas, Gautami's son also had dominion over Rishik, Ayamak, Moolak and Vidarbha etc
 uske pratyaksh prabhaav main rahane vaala kshetra uttar main malwa tathaa kathiyawad se lekar dakshin main krishna nadi tak tathaa puvai main baraar se lekar pashchim main konkan tak failaa hua tha
 He assumed the title 'tri-sea-toy-yellow-vehicle', indicating that his influence was in the eastern, western and southern seas, that is, the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean
 aisa prathit hota he ki apni mrityu ke kuch samay pehle gautami putr shatakarni dwaara nahpaan ko haraakar jite gaye kshetra uske haath se nikal gaye
 Those who snatched these territories from Gautami's son were probably the Shaka rulers of the Kardamak dynasty of the Scythian race
 iskaa pramaan hamen talami dwaara bhugol kaa varnan karti uski pustak se miltaa he
 a similar conclusion can also be drawn from the famous Rudradaman inscription of Junagadh of 150 AD
 yah shilaalekh darshata he ki nahpaan se vijit gautamiputra shatakarni ke sabhi pradeshon ko usase rudradaman ne hathiyaa liya
 It appears that Gautamiputra Shatkarni attempted to secure his territories captured by Rudradaman by establishing matrimonial relations with the Kardamak Shakas

png surabhedi bhashaa aisi bhashaa ko kaha jaataa he jisamen awaz ke sur ke badlaav ke aadhaar par shabdon or vaakyon kaa arth badal jaataa ho
 The Chinese language is the Surabhedi language spoken by most of the people of the world
 bharat main punjabi or dogri jaisi pashchimi pahari bhashaayen surabhedi hoti hai
 To some extent, emotions are communicated through notes in every language, but the meaning of words with the same characters varies only with the letters in the Surabhedi languages
 angreji main surabhedi bhashaaon ko "tonal langvejiz" kehete hai
 The meaning of the word "ma" in Chinese depends on the change of tone - agar suron ke badlaav ko tiron se dikhaaya jaae, to chini kii ek pankti is prakaar ho sakati he - If someone is not used to the Surabhedi languages, then he will only feel "mama ma ma de ma ma" in this line
 use lagegaa ke ek hi "maa" shabd baar-baar doharaaya ja rahaa he jabaki alag-alag suron kii vajah se vastav main yahan paanch alag shabd kahe ja rahe hai
 Similarly, in Punjabi, the notes are used - dhyaan rahe ke inhen punjabi kii donon lipiyon main alag-alag likhaa jaataa he, lekin inkaa uccharan ek-sa hota he
 Punjabi can be asked "whip, whip?" - If their notes are spoken properly, it means "horse, whip, or bitter" to Punjabi mothers
 It will be understood when it is possible that non-punjabis have been told that the same word has been said three times
