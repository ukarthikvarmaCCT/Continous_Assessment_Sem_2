 These lexicons that highlight the words, their various forms, their synonyms, their origins and development process, were helpful in the creation of knowledge, but they could not be placed in the category of knowledge

 The Hindi Gyan Kosh, created by the Nagari Pracharini Sabha of Kashi, is notable in this regard
 bangla main sahitya vaaridhi or shabd ratnakar kii oopaadhiyon se vibhooshit nagendra nath basu ne ek vishaal gyaanakosh taiyaar kiya
 Taking the benefit of Basu's experience from Calcutta on the same lines, he was entrusted with the responsibility of preparing a comprehensive knowledge dictionary in Hindi

 Describing it useful, Mahatma Gandhi wrote in his own recommendation that it will be helpful in the development of India's 'lingua-franca' Hindi

 He also wrote that the Knowledge Dictionary of Hindi is not a translation of Bangla, but was originally written in Hindi
 in koshon ke alaava hardev bahari rachit prasad sahitya kosh, premanarayan tandon krit 'hindi sevisansar' or gyanmandal dwaara prakashit sahityakosh ullekhneey he
 It is clear that these dictionaries could fulfill the needs of the discourse originating from social science

 But the Bangla Encyclopedia edited by Nagendranath Vasu is the first modern encyclopaedia derived from Indian languages
 bharatvarsh main is shrenee kaa yah pahula gransh tha jo 27 varsh ke athak parishram se anek dhurandhar vidwaanon ke sahyog dwaara purnataa ko praapt hua
 It was published in 1911 in 22 volumes
 usee samay uske prakashkon ko sujh pada ki "jis hindi bhashaa kaa prachaar or vistaar bharat main uttarottar badhata jaataa he or jise rashtrabhasha banane kaa udhyog ho rahaa he usee bharat kii bhavi rashtrabhasha main aise granth kaa na hona bade dukh or lajja kaa vishay he"
 That is why, by appreciative patience, he immediately laid the foundation of the Hindi encyclopedia and completed it
 nagendranath vasu ne hi anek hindi vidwaanon ke sahyog se hindi vishwakosh kii rachana kii jo san 1916 se 1932 ke madhya 25 khandon main prakashit hua
 While this work was going on, at the same time, Dr

 PHD started the process of creating an encyclopaedia in Marathi language and usually completed it in twelve years with the help of 40 writers

 Thereafter, the enthusiasm to feed his knowledge collection in Marathi Paadisin Gujarati cover was also increased and started

 But at the same time, the same inspiration arose in his heart which arose in the minds of Bengali lighters on completing the Bengali encyclopedia
 isaliye unhone turant hi shuddh hindi vishwakosh ke rachana kaa prastaav kiya jo sweekrut samayik style ke anusaar ho or jiske bishay sarvyaapee rashtrabhasha ke yogya hon
 All of the newly invented innovations have been included and the essence of all the year-wise material collected by Marathi, Gujarati and Bengali writers along with research has become embedded in the Hindi dictionary

 Scotland's National Monument is an unfinished structure located near the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, Scotland, as a memorial to the Scottish soldiers killed in the Napoleonic Wars
 calton pahari ke upar sthit is smarak kii sanrachana ko 1823-26 ke bich charles rabart kukarel or williabh henry plafare dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 It was to be built on the lines of the Parthenon of Athens as planned
 isi silsile main 1826 main shuru hue nirmaankarya ko 1829 main nidhi ke abhaav ke kaaran band karnaa padaa
 Due to its unfortunate history, it is often addressed by the inadequate or stigma of Scotland and Edinburgh, and the pride and poverty of Scotland and many other surnames

 According to the primary plan, Edinburgh's The Mound was chosen to build the monument, which was later rejected in favor of the Calton Hill
 janvari 1822 main ek prastaav rakhaa gaya kii kul £42,000 kii laagat se 'athens ke parthenon kii ek pratikruti ko hi rashtriya smarak ke rup main calton pahari par khadaa kiya jaae' is prastaav ko edinburgh ke sambhraant varg ke kai logon kaa sakaaratmak samarthan mila, jaise kii sar walter scot, lard henri kakbern or lard fransis jefri july 1822 main scotland ke rashtriya smarak ke liye yogadanakartaaon kii shahi sangat ko sansadeey adhinium dwaara gathit kiya gaya

 In the plan of this building, there was also a plan to build several basements primarily, so that important and famous Scottish figures could be buried there
 aisa sankalp bhi liya yaa tha kii is sthal ko scotland main, germany ke valahalla kii tarz par skotian valahalla ke rup main banaaya jayega
 Its foundation stone was established on 27 August 1822 during the visit of King George to Scotland

 band jalsambar yaa samaavruth jalsambar bhugol main aise jalsambar kshetra ko kaha jaataa he jisamen varsha athwa pighalati barf kaa pani ekatrit ho kar kisi nadi ke zariye samudr yaa mahaasaagar main bahane kii bajaay kisi sarovar, daldali kshetra yaa shushk kshetra main jaakar vahin ruk jaataa he
 Normally, whatever water falls on the earth due to rain or snow, it flows from the highlands to the lowlands through rivers, Nehru and waterfalls
 yah chalate pani ke samooh ek-dusre se sangam karte rahete hai jab tak ke ek hi badi nadi na ban jaae
 Then this river later joins some ocean
 lekin jo kshetra sagaron se dhalaan, pahaado yaa registaanon kii vajah se pruthak hai vahaan par pani sab se nichle sthaan par pahunch kar ruk jaataa he
 At such places, either lakes are formed or the earth absorbs the water
 duniya kii sab se badi jhiilon main aise hi band jalsambharon kii vajah se bani hui kuch jhilein hai, jaise kii aral sagar or caspian sagar
 The closed watershed in English is called the "endorheic Basin"
 bhugolic drushti se aisa dekha jaataa he ke band jalsambar vaale kshetra praayah registani kshetra bhi hote hai
 This is because if the water keeps increasing at one place, then eventually the water defeats the barrier between itself and the sea
 vaigyanikon kaa anumaan he ke krishna sagar kisi samay par aisi hi ek band jalsambar kii jhil thi jo pani badhane se apni simaaon ko todakar bumadhya sagar se ja mili
 The salt and other substances which are found in the open watersheds later flow into the ocean
 band jalsambharon main aisa nahin hota
 Salt and other substances found in water accumulate in these lakes or dry areas
 isliye band jalsambar jhilein samay ke saath bahut khaari ho jaati hai
 Sambhar Lake, located near Ajmer in the Indian state of Rajasthan, is a saline lake of similar closed watershed
 aisi jhiilon par pradushan kaa bhi bahut bura asar padataa he kyonki pradooshak samudr main bah kar teetar-bitar hone kii bajaay ekatrit hokar badhate hi rahete hai
 The number of closed watersheds in different continents also differs due to their different geographical and seasonal conditions
 australia kaa lagbhag 21% kshetrafal band jalsanbharon kaa kshetra he jabaki uttar america main band jalsambar keval 5% kshetra par faile hai
 About 18% of the world's land area suffers from closed watersheds
 duniya ke sab se adhik kshetrafal vaale band jalsambar asia ke bhitari ilaakon main paae jate hai
 In some dry areas, closed watersheds bring salt and other salts, but evaporate rapidly due to heat and dryness
 kahin-kahin par pani keval ek hi mausam main bah kar aata he yaa kuch yogon tak bahane ke baad bhugolic paristithiyon ke badal jane se aana band ho jaataa he
 The thick and hard layer of salt in such dry lake areas forms a wide flat plain that stretches for miles and miles
 kyonki aise namak ke maidan bilkul samtal or bahut bade hote hai, inkaa prayog tej gadiyon dwaara gati kirtiman sthapit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes the size of closed water reservoir lakes varies with the changing water flow with the seasons
 yah jhilein sookhe mausam main sikud jaati hai or barishon yaa himpat kii vajah se bad jaati hai
 Sometimes when the water is low, a lake gets divided into many small lakes and then after the rains the water rises and then it becomes a big lake
 agar kisi kshetra main aarthik vikaas ke saath pani rokane vaale band yaa sinchai ke liye naharen bana di jaaen jo band jalsambar jhiilon main pani kaa bahaav kam kar den, to aksar yah jhilein sikud kar bahut choti ho jaati hai
 In such a situation, those populations which depend on these lakes for their business or life have a very bad effect
 aisa hi kuch madhya asia ke aral sagar ke saath hua he
 View of the Patkai Mountains from Pangsoo Pass patkai bharat ke purvottar main burma ke saath lagi antarrashtriya simavarti kshetra par sthit pahari shrunkhalaaon kaa naam he
 Its mountains are much lower than the Himalayas
 patkai pahaado main teen mukhya shrunkhalaayen shaamil hai: patkai bum, khasi-gaaro-jayantiya shrunkhlaa or lushai pahadiyaan
 These mountains are widespread in the states of Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Mizoram in India
 pangasau darra patkai pahaado kaa sabase mahatvapurn pahari darra he or bharat ko burma se jodne vaali ledo road isi darre se nikalati he
 The 3,826-meter-high Saramati mountain on the indo-burma border is the highest peak of the Patkai mountains and is also the tallest non-himalayan mountain in the Indian subcontinent
 dhyaan den ki bharat-burma seemaa par is se unchaa 5,881 meter unchaa khaakabo raji pahaad bhi khadaa he lekin vah himalay parvaton kii ek upashrunkhalaa kaa sadsy he
 Ibn Battuta Arab traveler, scholar and author
 uttar africa ke morocco pradesh ke prasiddh nagar tanjier main 14 rajab, 703 hi
 ko inkaa janm hua tha
 His full name was Muhammad bin Abdullah ibn Battuta
 ebn batuta musalmaan yatriyon main sabase mahaan tha
 He estimated to have traveled about 75,000 miles
 itnaa lanbaa bhraman us yug ke shaayad hi kisi anya yatri ne kiya ho
 During his visit India also came
 inke purvajon kaa vyavsaay kaajiyon kaa tha
 Ibn Battuta was very religious from the beginning
 use makke kii yatra tathaa prasiddh musalamaanon kaa darshan karne kii badi abhilaashaa thi
 To fulfill this aspiration, he left to travel at the age of 21 only
 chalate samay usne yah kabhi na sochaa tha ki use itani lambii desh deshaantaron kii yatra karne kaa avasar milegaa
 Traveling to pilgrimage places like maize is an essential duty of every Muslim
 isi se saikadon musalmaan vibhinn deshon se makka aate rahete the
 To facilitate the long journeys of these travelers, many institutions were born at that time in the Muslim world, by which all these facilities were available and their tourism became very interesting and enjoyable
 inhon sansthaaon ke kaaran daridr se daridr "haji" bhi dur-dur deshon se aakar haj karne main samarth hote the
 Ibn Battuta has repeatedly praised these institutions
 vah unke prati atyant kritagya he
 The best among them was the organization by which complete arrangements were made in advance for every kind of convenience of the largest passenger groups and their security was also arranged along the way
 prayek gaanv tathaa nagar main khaankahen tathaa saraayen unke thaharne, khaane pine aadi ke liye hoti thim
 Religious leaders were particularly welcome
 har jagah shaikh, kaaji aadi unka vishesh satkar karte the
 This institution of doctrine was a vivid example of Islam's brotherhood
 isi ke kaaran deshadeshantaron ke musalmaan bekhatke tathaa bade aaraam se lambii lambii yatraayen kar sakate the
 Another feature enjoyed by the medieval Muslims was that the entire trade in Africa and Indian seaports was in the hands of Arab merchants
 ye saudagar bhi musalmaan yatriyon kaa utana hi aadar karte the
 Ibn Battuta arrived in Mecca with a caravan to Damascus and Palestine
 yatra ke dinon main do saadhuon se uski bhent hui thi jinhone usase purvi deshon kii yatra ke sukh saundarya kaa varnan kiya tha
 At the same time, he pledged to visit those countries
 makke se ebn battoota iraq, iran, mosul aadi sthanon main ghumkar 1329 main dubaara makka lautaa or vahaan teen baras thaharkar adhyayan tathaa bhagavandabhakti main laga rahaa
 Later, he resumed the journey and returned to Mecca again for the third time from the ports of South Arabian, East Africa and Persian, Hirmuz
 vahaan se vah kreemia, khiva, bukhaara hota hua afghanistan ke maarg se bharat aayaa
 On reaching India, Ibn Battuta became very rich and prosperous
 bharat pravesh - bharat ke uttar pashchim dwaar se pravesh karke vah sidhaa dilli pahunchaa, jahaan tughlaq sultan mohammad ne uskaa bada aadar satkar kiya or use rajdhani kaa kaaji niyukt kiya
 Staying in this post for seven years, in which he had the opportunity to observe the Sultan very closely, Ibn Battuta listened to every incident with great attention
 1342 main mohammad tughlaq ne use china ke badshaah ke paas apana rajdoot banaakar bheja, parantu dilli se prasthaan karne ke thode din baad hi vah badi vipatti main pad gaya or badi kathinaayee se apni jaan bachaakar anek aapattiyaan sahataa vah kalikat pahunchaa
 In such a situation, thinking that it was futile to go to China on the way to the ocean, he started traveling by landfall and reached China wandering in the regions of Lanka, Bengal etc
 kintu shaayad vah mongol khan ke darbar tak nahin gaya
 He then traveled to Muslim places in West Asia, North Africa, and Spain, and eventually to Timbukt etc
 He returned to Morocco's capital "phase" in early 1354
 iske dwaara arabi bhashaa main likhaa gaya uskaa yatra vrutant jise rihrila kaha jaataa he, 14veen shatabdi main bhartiya upmahadweep ke saamaajik tathaa saanskrithik jivan ke vishay me bahut hi rochak jaankariyaan detaa he
 Back in Morocco - Ibn Battuta was the greatest of Muslim travelers
 anumaanath: usne lagbhag 75,000 mile kii yatra kii thi
 Hardly any other traveler of that era has traveled so long
 "phej" lautakar usne apana bhramanvrittant sultan ko sunaaya
 On the order of the Sultan, his secretary Muhammad ibn Juza'i wrote him
 ebn batuta kaa baaki jivan apane desh main ho beetaa
 He died in 1377
 ebn battoota ke bhramanvrittant ko "tuhfaul nazzaar fi garaayab al amasaar va ajaayab al afasaar" kaa naam diya gaya
 a copy of it is preserved in the National Library of Paris
 uske yatraavritant main tatkaaleen bhartiya itihaas kii atyant upyogi saamagree milti he

 In economics, the English word stagflation refers to the situation when both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate remain high
 yah ek desh ke liye aarthik rup se ek mushkil sthiti hoti he, chunki, is samay donon hi mudrasphiti or aarthik aswirawa kii samasya ek saath utpann hoti hai or koi bhi vyapak aarthik niti ek hi samay main in samasyaon par ek saath dhyaan kendrit nahin kar sakati he
 The origin of the word stagflation consisting of two-word sounds is generally attributed to the British politician Len mcleod, who coined the term in 1965 during one of his speeches in the parliament there
 This concept is also notable partly because, in post-war macro-economic theory, inflation and recession were considered mutually exclusive, and also because stagflation has generally proved very difficult and once started
 However, in human terms as well as budget deficit, its elimination is very expensive
 raajnneetik kshetra main mudrasphitijanit mandi kaa ek saamaanya maapak jise mizri index kehete hai iskaa upyog sanyukt rajya america main 1976 or 1980 ke raashtrapati chunaavon ko palatney ke liye kiya gaya
 Economists have provided two major explanations for why stagflation occurs
 sabase pehle, mudrasphitijanit mandi us samay falit ho sakati he jab achaanak se hue pratikul aapurti ke dwaara kisi arthvyavastha kii utpaadak kshamta kam ho jaati he, jaise tel aayaat karne vaale desh ke liye tel kii keemton main vruddhi
 is tarah ke ek achaanak se hue pratikul aapurti ke kaaran ek hi samay main keemton main bhi vruddhi hone lagati he or saath hi utpaadan mulya main adhik vruddhi or kam munafa arthvyavastha ko dhimi gati pradaan karata he
 This type of inflationary downturn brings a policy dilemma because actions that are designed to combat inflation make economic stability worse and vice versa
 duusari, sthirataa or mudrasphiti donon hi anuchit vyapak aarthik nitiyon ke parinaam ho sakate hai
 Central banks, for example, can cause inflation by allowing excessive growth of the money supply, and the government can lead to stability by excessive regulation of the goods market and labor market, neither of which can cause inflationary recession
 Can cause
 dhan kii aapurti main atyadhik vikaas jise aisi charam seemaa tak le jaaya jaataa he ki use achaanak palataanaa pade, saaf taur par ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 Extreme government policies that increase spending widely, such as protectionist import tariffs, significant increases in environmental regulations or excessive increases in the minimum wage, may also account for this
 1970 ke dashak ke vaishvik mudrasphitijanit mandi ke vishleshan main donon prakaar ke spashtikaran kii peshkash kii gayi he: isaki shuruyaat tel kii keemton main baari vruddhi ke saath hui, lekin uske baad bhi yah jari rahi, jab kendriya bainkon ne parinami mandi ke pratikriya swaroop atyadhik uttejnaatmak maudrik niti kaa upyog kiya, jisase ek ghor mazdooree- mulya utchakr parinamit hua
 By the 1960s, many Keynesian economists ignored the possibility of stagflation, as based on historical experience it was observed that high unemployment is uniquely associated with low inflation and vice versa
 The assumption was that high demand for goods increases prices and at the same time motivates firms to employ more workers; And in the same way high employment increases demand
 haalanki, 1970 ke dashak or 1980 ke dashak main, jab mudrasphitijanit mandi saamne ai, tab yah zaahir ho gaya ki mudrasphiti kii dar or rojgaar ke staron ke bich sambandh sthir hon yah jaruri nahin he: iskaa matlab yah tha ki philips sambandh ko hataaya ja saktaa tha
 Macroeconomists became more skeptical of Keynesian theory, and the Kenyans themselves revisited their own ideas to find the details of stagflation
 philips karv ko hathaaye jane ke liye vivaran praarambhik rup se mudravaadi arthshaastri milton fridman or edmund felps dwaara die gaye
 Both argued that when workers and companies start expecting higher inflation, the Phillips curve shifts upward
 His suggestion was particularly that if inflation lasted for many years, employees and companies would start taking care of it during the negotiation of wage negotiations, which would lead to a rapid increase in the salaries of employees and the cost of companies and consequently inflation would increase further is
 jabaki yah vichaar kinesian siddhant kii ek gambhir aalochana thi, ise dhire dhire adhiktar kenneswanon dwaara apana liya gaya or ise nae kinesian aarthik modelon main shaamil kar liya gaya
 Contemporary Keynesian analysis argued that stagflation can be understood by two differentiating factors affecting aggregate demand and affecting aggregate supply
 jahaan samgr maang main utaar chadhaav kaa saamana karte hue arthvyavastha ko sthir karne ke liye maudrik or rajkoshiya niti kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, vahiin ve samgr aapurti ke utaar chadhaav kaa saamana karne ke liye upyogi nahin he
 In particular, an unfavorable blow to the overall supply, such as an increase in oil prices, can also lead to an inflation-driven slowdown
 nav kinesian siddhant ne do bhinn prakaar ke mudrasphiti ko pratishthit kiya: maang-karshan or laagat-dabaav 
 mudrasphitijanit mandi, is drishy main, cost-push mudrasphiti ke kaaran hota he
 Cost-push inflation occurs when a force or condition increases the cost of production
 yah sarkari nitiyon ke kaaran ho saktaa he, yaa yah vishuddh rup se bahya karkon jaise prakritik sansadhano kii kami yaa yuddh ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 Supply theory is based on the neo-keynesian cost-push model and holds stagflation to significant demand-side disruptions of the demand-supply market equation, for example, when suddenly important goods, natural resources, or goods and services There is a real or relative shortage of natural capital needed to produce
 anya kaarak bhi aapurti kii samasya kaa kaaran ho sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye, saamaajik or raajnneetik avasthaa jaise niti main parivartan, yuddh ke krityon, samaajawaadee pratibandhak yaa utpaadan par rashtravaadi niyantran
 is vichaar ke antargat, yah mana jaataa he ki mudrasphitijanit mandi ek pratikul aapurti jhatka lagane par hi utpann hoti he jo baad main vastuon or sevaaon ke mulyon main oochaal kaa kaaran banati hai 
 takneekee shabdon main, yah arthvyavastha ke samgr aapurti vakr ke sankuchan yaa nakaaratmak badlaav ko falit karata he
 In a resource scarcity scenario, stagflation occurs when economic growth is constrained by a limited supply of raw materials
 arthath, jab buniyadi samagriyon khanij, utpaadan main lagi krishi yogya bhoomi, lakdi, aadi) kii vaastavik yaa saapeksh aapurti, badhate yaa nirantar maang kii pratikriya main kam ho jaati he or / yaa paryaapt rup se teji se badhaai nahin ja sakati he
 Resource scarcity can be a real material shortage or a relative scarcity caused by taxes or poor monetary policy that affected the price or availability of raw materials
 yah nav-kinesian siddhant ke cost-push mudrasphiti karkon ke anuroop he
 It is in this way that after the supply shock, the economy will first try to maintain its momentum - that is, consumers and businesses will start paying higher prices to maintain their level of demand
 The central bank can increase this by increasing the money supply, for example by lowering interest rates in an effort to deal with a recession
 Increased money supply supports demand for goods and services, although demand generally declines during recessions
 kinesian model main, ucch mulya se maal or sevaaon kii aapurti main vruddhi prerit hogi
 haalanki, ek kii aapurti sadame ke dauraan, aapurti us rup main pratikriya nahin karti jaisaa vah saamaanya rup in mulya dabaavon main karti hai
 Therefore, inflation rises and production falls, creating an inflation-driven slowdown

 Perhaps the most notorious factor cited at the time was the failure of the Peruvian anchovy fishery in 1972, which was a major source of livestock supplements

 Price controls resulted in shortages at the point of purchase, leading to increased queues of consumers at fuel stations and production costs for industry, for example
 siddhanton ke is set ke tahat, mudrasphitijanit mandi kaa samaadhaan saamagree kii aapurti ko behaal kiya janaa he
 In the case of a material shortage, stagflation is reduced by either replacing lost resources or developing ways to increase energy efficiency and economic productivity so that more products can be produced with less input
 For example, oil shortages in the late 1970s and early 1980s were relieved by increases in both energy capacity and global oil production
 yah pahalu, maudrik nitiyon main samaayojan ke saath mil kar mudrasphitijanit mandi ko samaapt karne main madadgaar rahaa
 a purely neoclassical view of macroeconomics rejects the idea that monetary policy actually has any effect
 navashastreey sthool arthshaastriyon kaa yah tark he ki vaastavik aarthik matraaen, jaise vaastavik utpaada, rojgaar or berogari, keval asli karkon dwaara hi nirdhaarit kiye ja sakate he
 Nominal factors such as changes in the money supply only affect nominal factors such as inflation
 yah navashastreey vichaar ki nammaatr karkon kaa vaastavik prabhaav nahin padataa he, 'maudrik tatasthta' kehalaata he yaa 'shastreey virodhabhas' bhi kaha jaataa he
 As the neoclassical approach states that facts such as unemployment are essentially unrelated to a minor phenomenon such as inflation, a neoclassical economist would offer two different interpretations for 'stability' and 'inflation'
 Neoclassical explanations of sustainability include inefficient government exchange or greater benefits for the unemployed, which provides less motivational for people to find jobs
 sthirataa kaa ek or navashastreey vivaran, vaastavik vyapaar chakra siddhant ke dwaara diya gaya he, jisamen shram utpaadakta main koi bhi kami, kam kaam karne ko kushal banaati he
 The main neoclassical explanation of inflation is very simple: it is when monetary authorities greatly increase the money supply
 navashastreey drushtikon main, vaastavik kaarak jo utpaadan or berogari kaa nirdhaaran karti he keval kul aapurti vakr ko hi prabhavit karti he
 Nominal factors that determine inflation only affect the aggregate demand curve
 jab vaastavik kaarak main kuch pratikul parivartan kul aapurti vakr ko baayen hataata he usee samay vah anupyukt maudrik nitiyaan kul maang vakr ko dayee ore hataati hai, to parinaam mudrasphitijanit mandi hoti he
 In this way, the main account of stagflation under the classical approach to the economy is simply policy errors that affect both inflation and the labor market
 vyangypurvak, mudrasphitijanit mandi ke shastreey vyakhya ke paksh main ek bahut spasht tark swayan keens dwaara pradaan kiya gaya
 In 1919, John Maynard Keynes described in his book The Economic Consequences of the Peace that inflation and economic stability were taking Europe in its grip
 keens ne likhaa he: Keynes clearly pointed out the connection between currency printing and inflation by the government
 keens ne yah bhi ingit kiya ki kaise sarkari mulya niyantran, utpaadan ko hatotsahit karte hai
 Keynes described in detail the relationship between the German government's deficit and inflation
 jabaki adhikansh arthshaastriyon kaa maananaa he ki mudra aapurti main parivartan kaa alpakaaleen samay main kuch vaastavik prabhaav ho saktaa he, navashastreey or nav-kinesian arthshaastri is baat par sahamat hai ki mudra aapurti main parivartan ke koi deergh kaaleen parinaam nahin he
 Therefore, economists who consider themselves neo-keynesians generally believe that currency is neutral in the long run
 duusare shabdon main, jahaan navashastreey or nav-kinesian modelon ko praayah ek pratispardhaatmak vichaardhaaraon ke rup main dekha jaataa he, unhen do alag vivaranon ke rup main bhi dekha ja saktaa he jo do alag samay kshitijon ke liye upyukt hai
 Today many mainstream textbooks consider the neo-keynesian model to be an accurate description of the economy in the short run, when prices are 'stagnant' and the neoclassical model as the precise statement for a long-term economy, when prices have a full adjustment
 Have enough time for isliye, aaj jab mukhyadhara ke arthshaastri praayah alpakaaleen mudrasphitijanit mandi ke liye aapurti main pratikul parivartan ko jimmedaar tehra sakate hai, ve ise dirghakaalik mudrasphitijanit mandi ke liye ek vyakhya ke rup main sweekaar nahin karenge
 adhik lambey samay tak chalane vaali mudrasphitijanit mandi ko anuchit sarkari nitiyon ke prabhaav ke rup main varnit kiya jayega: utpaada bazaar or shram bazaar kaa atyadhik niyaman jo dirghakaalik tehraav main falit hota he or mudra aapurti kii atyadhik vruddhi dirghakaalik mudrasphiti main falit hoti he
 Political economists Jonathan Nitzan and Samson Bichler have proposed an explanation of stagflation as part of a theory they call differential accruals, which states that companies leave them behind rather than increase average profit further capitalization Seeks opportunities
 is siddhant ke anusaar, vilay or adhigrahan ke samay mudrasphitijanit mandi ke samay ke saath dolyman hote hai
 When mergers and acquisitions are no longer politically feasible, stagflation is used as an alternative to higher relative profits than competition
 badhati vilay or adhigrahan ke saath, mudrasphitijanit mandi ko lagu karne kii shakti bad jaati he
 Inflationary recession appears as a social crisis, for example during the oil crisis period of the 70s and 2008–2006
 However, in an inflation-driven slowdown, inflation does not affect all companies equally
 Major companies can increase their own prices faster than competitors
 jabaki samgr rup se koi bhi labhanvit hota nahin dikhaai detaa, bhinn hokar pramukh companiyaan ucch saapeksh laabh or ucch saapeksh poonjeevaad ke saath apni sthiti sudhaar leti hai
 Inflationary recession is not due to any real supply shock, but rather to a social crisis that indicates a supply crisis
 yah adhiktar ek 20veen or 21veen sadi kii ghatana he jo mukhya rup se "vepndollar-petrodollar koelishan" dwaara prayog kiya gaya tha jisamen aarthik hiton ke liye madhya purv sankat ko utpann yaa prayog kiya gaya
 The demand-pull stagflation theory explores the idea that stagflation can arise exclusively from monetary shocks, without any concurrent supply shocks or negative shifts in economic output capacity
 Demand-pull theory describes a scenario where stagflation can occur after a monetary policy implementation period that gives rise to inflation
 yah siddhant pratham baar 1999 main harvard vishvavidhyalay ke jon epa kennedy skool of gorment ke aduardo loyo dwaara prastaavit kiya gaya tha
 Supply-side economics emerged in response to the US stagflation in the 1970s
 This largely attributed the end of the 1971 Bretton Woods system to inflation and the lack of a specific price reference in subsequent monetary policies
 Supply-side economists said the rise in inflation-driven real tax rates results in contractionary components of stagflation
 mudrasphitijanit mandi maudrik niti ke liye duvidha ban jaati he, jab aarthik vikaas ko badhaane ke liye bani nitiyaan aam taur par mudrasphiti ko aage or badhaane lagati he jabaki mudrasphiti se jujhane ke liye istemaal kii jane vaali nitiyaan pehle se hi girti hui arthvyavastha ko or gira detii he
 An important economic mechanism to accelerate economic growth is the reduction in interest rates, which reduces the cost of consumers to purchase products on credit and borrowing for the production expansion of businesses
 haalanki yah aarthik gatividhiyon ko badha saktaa hai, yah mudrasphiti main vruddhi ko bhi falit karata hai
 To reduce inflation, monetary arrangements are made by lowering interest rates, which increases the cost of credit for consumers to buy products on credit and expand production in the business
 haalanki yah mudrasphiti ko kam kar saktaa he, lekin yah aarthik gatividhi main kami ke rup main parinat ho saktaa he
 Inflationary recession poses a problem only when the main monetary policy tools that are available to support the central bank guidelines of the domestic economy cause more marginal losses than greater marginal benefits when used
 antat, kendriya bank yaa to arthvyavastha ko protsaahit kar saktaa he yaa uske mukhya upkaran, gharelu byaaj dar ko samyojit karne ke tantra ke madhyam se adhikaar kar lene kaa prayaas kar saktaa he
 An option can be implemented to improve growth, but does it ignite systemic inflation? An alternative can be implemented that helps fight inflation, but how badly will it collide with growth? Both problems exist simultaneously during a period appropriately described as stagflation
 aadhunik samay main, mudrasphitijanit mandi keval tabhi ho sakati he, jab kendriya bank apane adhikaar main hone vaale sabase behtareen maatraatmak upayon ke istemaal dwaara, donon lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye sabhi sambhav upkarnon kaa istemaal kar le
 asaamaanya anupaat kii pramukh aarthik sthitiyaan pehle se hi donon morchon main lagbhag-sankat paidaa kar chuki hoti hai isse pehle ki mudrasphitijanit mandi phir se shuru ho jaae
 mudrasphitijanit mandi us duvidha kaa naam he jo tab rahati he jab kendriya bank yaa to mudrasphiti yaa sthirataa ko thik kar paane main swayan ko shaktiheen ghoshit kar detaa he
 The problem is far less clear for fiscal policy
 rajasav or vyay donon hi mudrasphiti ke saath badhate hai or santulit bajet raajnneeti ke saath, ve vikaas kii gati dhimi hote hi gir jate hai
 Unless there is a differential impact on revenue or expenses due to stagflation, the effect of stagflation on the balance of the budget is not entirely clear
 vichaaron kii ek dhara kaa yah maananaa he ki sarvottam niti mishran vah he jisamen sarkaar kharch ko badha kar or karon ko gata kar vikaas ko badhaava detii he, jabaki kendriya bank ucch byaaj daron ke madhyam se mudrasphiti se juujhati he
 Whatever principle is used, it is not an easy task to coordinate between fiscal and monetary policies

 He has miraculous consciousness
 uski daud jidhar bhi chal padati he, udhar hi chamatkaari uplabdhiyaan prastut karti he
 The power of the inner being is invisible and more powerful than the outside world

 log jaankaree praapt karne ke liye saamanyat: apni paanch indriyon- aankh, kaan, naak, jeebh tathaa twachaa kaa prayog karte hai, kintu sansar main aise vyakti bhi hai jo ki indriyon ke prayog ke bina hi asaamaanya vidhiyon se jaankaree praapt kar lete hai
 Parapsychology refers to this ability to receive information through unusual methods as psychic perception
 duusare shabdon main kaha ja saktaa he ki atindriya bodh kisi vyakti kii chhathi indriya he
 Information obtained from psychic perception can be of any period from present, past or future
 atindriya bodh kaa itihaas In 1870, Sir Richard Burton, Fellow of the Geological Society, first used the term imperceptible perception
 pun: 1870 main hi atindriya bodh shabd kaa prayog francisi shodhakarta ke dwaara kiya gaya
 In 1892, the term was used by Dr
 Pal Jori to describe persons affected by hypnosis
 yah ek saamaanya vishwaas he ki sammohan se prabhavit vyakti atindriya bodh kaa pradarshan karata he
 Dr
 Rudolf Tishner, an ophthalmologist from Munich, used the term psychic perception in the 1920s to materialize consciousness
 prayog kiya
 Finally, in 1930, American psychologist JB Rinne popularized the term psychic perception
 rine hi pehle paramanovaigyanik the, jinhone atindriya bodh par prayogshaala main anek prayog kiye
 It is known from the demonstration of psychic perception that it is very difficult to interpret it by physical rules
 vichaar kii tarang When a wave arises in the mind, man does not realize what he is doing and what he has to do
 The effect of such a wave of thought is bizarre
 par iske ulat asar ekaagratha kaa hota he
 Concentration is a great power
 jis vyakti main ekaagratha kii shakti viksit ho jaati he, uski sari shakti kendrit ho jaati he or vah kendrit shakti visphot karti he
 Just as gunpowder is blasted to remove a rock, so is a blast to remove the power cover
 atindriya sadhana ke upaae There are many ways to cultivate psychic knowledge
 unamem do hai-indriya kaa sanyam or sthirikaran yaa ekaagratha
 Stabilization is also for the mind and speech and body also, this is the concentration
 jab man, vaani or sharir kii chanchaltaayen samaapt hoti hai, tab baadhaaen dur hat jaati hai
 The biggest obstacle is agility
 hilte hue darpan main munh dikhaai nahin detaa
 The mouth can be seen only in a static mirror
 jab chetana sthir hoti he, tab isamen bahut chijen dekhi ja sakati hai
 When consciousness is fickle, then nothing is seen in it
 nirvikalp or ekaagratha The third way is to be neutral
 nirvikalp kaa arth he, vichaaron kaa tantaa tut jaae
 There is a huge difference between concentration and formlessness
 ekaagratha kaa arth he, kisi ek bindu par tik janaa
 This too is a kind of fickleness
 ham ahan yaa om par sthir ho gaye, phir bhi chanchalta he
 There is no choice, no words, no contemplation and contemplation
 nirvikalp avasthaa main na sphurti rahati he, na kalpana rahati he
 There is no outside knowledge
 isamen keval antarmukhataa, aatmanubhuti, gaharaai main dubkiyaan lenaa hota he
 In this case the wrapper breaks very quickly
 aavaran ko bal miltaa he vikalpon ke dwaara
 Choice gives rise to choice
 tarang-tarang ko paidaa karti he
 When the option ends, then aavaran ko poshan nahin mil paata
 It automatically wanes
 aahaar ke abhaav main jaise sharir ksheen hota he, vaise hi poshan ke abhaav main aavaran ksheen hota jaataa he
 Only those who have concentration, lack of objectivity and equality, have attained psychic knowledge
 atindiy gyaan ke teen prakaar hai -avadhigyaan, man:paryavagyaan or kevalgyaan
 The attainment of parity is an essential condition for achieving all this
 jab tak raag-dwesh yaa priyata- Man remains entangled in the duality of unpleasantness, as long as the cover continues to be nourished
 jab samta sadh jaati he, tab aavaran pusht nahin hota
 The imperceptible consciousness awakens only in the attenuation of the cover
 bhagwaan mahavir, mahatma buddha, isa messiah, mohammad sahab aadi jitne bhi vishisht vyakti hue hai or jin-jin ko vishisht gyaan yaa bodhi kii prapti hui he, vah sadhana ke dwaara hi hui he
 Parity is an important part of that particular practice
 samta kii sadhana The practice of equality is the practice of sense restraint
 iske antargat aahaar-sanyam kii baat swat: praapt ho jaati he
 Dietary restraint helps in awakening our inner strength
 aahaar sharir poshan ke liye aavashyak he, to aahaar sanyam gyaan ke sroton ko pravaahit karne ke liye anivaary he
 The dirt settles with food and it becomes so dense that the awareness of the imperceptible consciousness remains, the sensory consciousness also gets disturbed
 hamaara sharir atindriya gyaan kaa strot he
 Sometimes a sudden event happens and those sources are revealed, then the man starts experiencing the attainment of psychic knowledge
 sadhana or aakasmikta, ye donon atindriya gyaan kii prapti main sahaayak hote hai
 Sadhana has its own specialty, because it has a certain process
 aakasmikta kabhi-kabhaar hoti he
 This will awaken psychic consciousness atindriya chetana ko jagaane kii sharten 1
 Don't get bad thoughts

 anaavashyak vichaar na aaen

 Do not get ideas at all
 yahi vikaas kaa kram he
 Do not understand that today we are sitting to meditate and today the thought will stop coming
 yah sambhav nahin he, kyonki hamane anginat sambandh jod rakhe hai
 The person is sitting at home and the factory is running in the mind
 dukaan main baitha he or The family is trailing
 dhyaan-shivi main aap akele aae hai, patni peeche he, aapkaa man uski chintaa main ulajhaa hua he
 The connection is with thousands of things and no one can get ideas, how is it possible
 sambandh or vichaar Relations and ideas are both interconnected
 jahaan sambandh he, vahaan vichaar kaa aana anivaary he
 It would have been possible if you had come free from all the relations while coming for meditation, but come bound, so it is not possible to get so much relaxation soon
 is sutara par dhyaan den- jitne zyada The sense of relationship liberation, the more irresponsible
 aap vichaaron ko rokane kaa praytn na karen, pehle sambandhon ko kam karne kaa praytn karen
 You have signed the contract - if you want to meet at three o'clock, then at half past two, your mental attitude will change and you will start watching
 kisi or kaam main phir man nahin lagegaa
 If half an hour is delayed then your annoyance will increase
 aap is bhram main na rahen- ek hi din main man ke saare sankalp-vikalp samaapt ho jaaenge
 Never think so
 ek-do yaa paanch-saat dinon ke dhyaan se bhi aisa sambhav nahin hoga
 Be very realistic, understand the truth and walk
 hamane apane anubandhon kaa jitna vistaar kiya he, sambandhon ko jitna vistrut kiya he, unke prati jab tak hamaari muchrcha kam nahin hogi, ve sambandh kam nahin honge, tab tak vichaaron ke pravaah ko bhi roka nahin ja sakegaa
 Skip the worry dhyaan karne vaale ke liye yah apekshit he ki vah vichaaron kii chintaa chode, pehle muchrcha ko kam karne kii baat sochen
 If ideas come, what do they spoil you? You connect with them, only then something happens to you, otherwise you will not gain anything or loss
 aap anubandhon main funsate hai, vichaaron main ulajhate hai, unki chintaa karte hai
 If you are affected by them, then your loss is bound to happen, the trouble is bound to increase
 hamen vichaaron ke saath judsa nahin he, vichaaron ke saath bahna nahin he
 The idea came and went
 juden nahin, maatr dekhen
 If this happens then the thought will not create any difficulty
 aap tatasth ban jaaen, madhyasth ban jaaen, drushtaa or gyaata ban jaaen, vichaaron ko jaanate-dekhte rahen, unki preksha karte rahen, ve aapaki pareshaani or udignata kaa kaaran kabhi nahin banenge
 People who get a lot of ideas during meditation karnaa chahie
 How much day and night through each city gadibhan, vaahan daudte rahete hai
 Roadside dukaan kaa dukandaar agar unheen par dhyaan detaa rahe to pagal ho jaae
 He pays attention to his business
 baaki sab chizon ko vah dekhakar bhi andekha kar detaa he
 The meditation practitioner has to do the same
 yadi yah jaagrukta bani rahe, drushtikon sahi ho jaae to sab thik ho jaae
 Immense power in our body dhyaan kii avasthaa main bahut bure vichaar aate hai to dhyaan hi nahin ho paata or yadi koi vichaar na aata to ham samadhi kii avasthaa main chale jate, dhyaan kii jarurat hi na rah jaati
 So our meditation is just fine
 madhya kaa maarg he yah
 Neither let us over-imagine nor be disappointed, just pay attention to our awareness, continuously increase it
 dekhne main badi shakti he
 Let us increase the practice of seeing
 dekhne kaa taatpary hamaari jaagrukta se he
 As the power of observation increases, thoughts will also reduce
 jahaan aadar nahin hoga, vahaan koi kyon aayega? agar aap vichaar kaa swaagat karenge, usase apnaapan jodenge to ve aapke sthaayee mehmaan banane kii koshish karenge
 If ignored, they will automatically go away
 jaise-jaise yah jaagrukta badhegi, vichaar kii samasya samahit hoti chali jaaegi

 For visitor introduction to Wikipedia, see page about Wikipedia
 vikipedia ek muft, web aadhaarit or sahyogi bahubhashi vishwakosh he, jo gaiyr-laabh vickemedia foundation se sahyog praapt pariyojna main utpann hua
 Its name is a combination of the two words Wiki and Encyclopedia
 duniya bhar main swayamsevakon ke dwaara sahyog se vikipedia ke 13 million lekh likhe gaye hai or iske lagbhag sabhi lekhon ko vah koi bhi vyakti sampadit kar saktaa he, jo vikipedia websit kaa upyog kar saktaa he
 It was started in January 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, currently the most popular reference work on the Internet
 vikipedia ke aalochak ise vyavasthit purvaagrah or asangatiyon ko doshi tehraate hai, or aarope lagate hai ki yah isaki sampadakeey prakriya main uplabdhiyon par sahmati kaa paksh leti he
 The reliability and accuracy of Wikipedia is also an issue

 Jonathan d of the New York Times, and Andrew Leah, in the fifth International Symposium on Online Journalism, described the importance of Wikipedia not only in the context of an encyclopedia but also as a frequently updated news source because it was recently Offers a very quick article about the events in jab time patrika ne you ko varsh 2006 ke liye person of da year kii manyata di or bataaya ki duniya bhar main kai million upyogkartaaon ke dwaara iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he or online sahyog main isaki badhati safalataa ko manyata di, isane web 2

 Wikipedia began as a complementary project to Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed as part of a formal process
 nupedia kii sthapana 9 march 2000 ko ek web portal company bomis, ink ke swaamitv ke tahat kii gayi
 Its main members were Jimmy Wales, Bomis CEO and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief of Nupedia and later Wikipedia
 prarambh main nupedia ko iske apane nupedia open content license ke tahat license diya gaya or richard stallmen ke suzav par vikipedia kii sthapana se pehle ise GNU ke muft documentation license main badal diya gaya
 Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales are the founders of Wikipedia
 jahaan ek ore wales ko saarvajanik rup se sampadan yogya vishwakosh ke nirmaan ke uddeshy ko paribhaashit karne ke shrey diya jaataa he, senger ko aamtaur par is uddeshy ko puraa karne ke liye ek viki kii ranneeti kaa upyog karne kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 On 10 January 2001, Larry Sanger proposed the Nupedia mailing list to produce a wiki as a "feeder project" for Nupedia
 vikipedia ko aupchaarik rup se 15 janvari 2001 ko, www
wikipedia
com par ekmaatr angreji bhashaa ke sanskaran ke rup main shuru kiya gaya
 And it was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list
 vikipedia kii "neutral point of vyuu" kii niti ko iske praarambhik maheenon main sanketabaddh kiya gaya, ore yah nupedia kii praarambhik "pakshpaatahin" niti ke samaan thi
 Otherwise, initially there were relatively few rules and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia
 vikipedia ne nupedia se praarambhik yogadanakarta praapt kiye, ye the sleshdot posting or search ingine indexing
 By the end of 2001, it had nearly 20,000 articles and 18 language editions
 2002 ke ant tak iske 26 bhashaaon ke sanskaran ho gaye, 2003 ke ant tak 46 or 2004 ke antim dinon tak 161 bhashaaon ke sanskaran ho gaye
 Nupedia and Wikipedia were present together until the former's server was permanently down in 2003 and its text was moved to Wikipedia
 9 sitambar 2007 ko angreji vikipedia 2 million lekh kii sankhya ko paar kar gaya, yah tab tak kaa sabase bada sankalit vishwakosh ban gaya, yahan tak ki isane yongal vishwakosh ke record ko bhi tod diya, jisane 600 varshon ke liye kaayam rakhaa tha
 Due to lack of control and perceived commercial advertising in an alleged English-focused Wikipedia, Spanish Wikipedia users split from Wikipedia in February 2002 to form Enciclopedia Libre
 baad main usee varsh, wales ne ghoshit kiya ki vikipedia vigyapanon kaa pradarshan nahin karegaa or isaki websit ko wikipedia

 Many other projects have since been separated from Wikipedia for editorial reasons

 New projects inspired by Wikipedia — such as citizendiam, scholarpedia, Conservapedia and Googles Knoll — have been launched to address Wikipedia's perceived limitations, such as its policies on peer review, original research, and commercial advertising
 vikipedia foundation kaa nirmaan 20 june 2003 ko vikipedia or nupedia se kiya gaya
 It was applied to the Trademark Office and the US Patent to trademark Wikipedia on 17 September 2004
 is mark ko 10 janvari 2006 ko panjikaran kaa darja diya gaya
 Trademark protection was provided by Japan on 16 December 2004 and by the European Union on 20 January 2005
 takneekee rup se ek sarvice mark, mark kaa scope "internet ke madhyam se aam vishwakosh ke gyaan ke kshetra main jaankaree ke praavdhaan" ke liye he, kuch utpaadon jaise pustakon or dvds ke liye vikipedia trademark ke upyog ko license dene kii yojanayen banaayi ja rahi hai
 As a general reference work, Wikipedia also contains some content that some, including Wikipedia editors, consider offensive, objectionable, and obscene
 udhaaharan ke liye, 2008 main, vikipedia, ne is niti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, apane angreji sanskaran main, mohammad ke varnan ko shaamil karne ke khilaaf ek ek online yachika ko asweekaar kar diya
 Due to the presence of politically sensitive content in Wikipedia, the People's Republic of China prohibited the use of parts of this website
 vikipedia ke avyav florida main kanoon ke adheen hai, jahaan vikipedia ke sarvaron kii mejabani kii jaati he or kai sampadakeey nitiyaan or dishanirdesh is baat par bal dete hai ki vikipedia ek vishwakosh he
 Each entry in Wikipedia must be about a subject that relates to the encyclopedia and is eligible for inclusion as such
 ek vishay vishwakosh se sambandhit samajha ja saktaa he yadi yah vikipedia ke shadjaal main "ullekhneey" he, arthath, yadi isane un madhyamik vishwasaneey sroton main mahatvapurn kawarez praapt kiya he, jo is vishay ke maamle se swatantra hai
 Second, Wikipedia has to display only the knowledge that is already established and recognized
 duusare shabdon main, udhaaharan ke liye ise nayi jaankaree or mul kaary ko prastut nahin karnaa chahie
 a claim that can be challenged requires a reference to reliable sources
 vikipedia samudaay ke bheetar, ise aksar "verifiability, not truth" ke rup main bataaya jaataa he, yah is vichaar ko vyakt karata he ki pathak khud lekh main prastut hone vaali saamagree kii sachai kii jaanch kar saken or is vishay main apni khud kii vyakhya banaayen
 ant main, vikipedia ek paksh nahin letaa he
 All views and approaches, if they can specify external sources, must find a suitable part of coverage within an article
 vikipedia ke sampadak ek samudaay ke rup main un nitiyon or dishanirdeshon ko likhte hai or sanshodhit karte hai, or unhen delit karke un par bal dete hai, tag laga kar unki vyakhya karte hai, yaa lekh kii us saamagree main sanshodhan karte hai jo uski jaruraton ko puraa karne main asafal hoti hai
 Contributors, whether they are registered or not, can take advantage of the features available in the software, which make Wikipedia strong
 prayek lekh se judaa "itihaas" kaa prishth lekh ke prayek pichley dohraan kaa record rakhata he, haalaanki abhiyogptr ke avyavon, aapraadhik dhamkee yaa copirite ke ulanghan ke dohraan ko baad main hataaya ja saktaa he
 This feature makes comparisons between older and newer versions easier, helps undo changes that the editor finds unnecessary, or even helps restore lost components
 prayek lekh se sambandhit "discshan " ke prishth kai sampadakon ke bich kaary kaa samanvay karne ke liye prayukt kiye jate hai
 Regular contributors often maintain a "watchlist" of articles of their interest, so that they can easily keep tabs on all recent changes to those articles
 Since the creation of a computer program called Bots, it has been widely used to remove demolition patterns, to correct misspellings and stylistic issues, and from statistical data to standard format geographical entries such as articles Is done to start
 sampadan model kaa khulaa swabhaav vikipedia ke adhikansh aalochakon ke liye centre bana rahaa he
 For example, on any occasion, the reader of an article cannot be sure whether the article he is reading contains a demolition tendency
 aalochak tark dete hai ki gaiyr visheshgy sampaadan gunvattta ko kam kar detaa he
 Because contributors typically rewrite a small portion of an entry rather than an entire encore, the components of high and low quality in an entry may be mixed
 itihaaskaar roy rogenjavig ne kaha: "kul milakar, lekhan vikipedia kaa kamjor aadhaar he
 Committees sometimes write well, and the quality of Wikipedia's entries is often unstable as a result of sentences or episodes written by different people
 " ye sabhi sateek soochna ke ek strot ke rup main vikipedia kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal paidaa karte hai
 In 2008, two researchers theorized that the development of Wikipedia is sustainable

 Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia is generally reliable, but the reliability of any given article is not always clear
 paaramparik sandarbh kaary jaise encychlopedia britanika ke sampadak, ek vishwakosh ke rup main pariyojna kii upyogita or pratishtha par sawaal uthaate hai
 Many university spokespersons discourage students from using any encyclopaedia in academic work as their primary source; Some specifically prohibit the use of Wikipedia
 sah sansthaapak jimi wales is baat par jor dete he ki kisi bhi prakaar kaa vishwakosh aamtaur par praathmik strot ke rup main upyukt nahin hai or praadhikrut ke rup se is par bharosa nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Issues have also been raised regarding lack of accountability as a result of users' privacy, as well as artificial information entry, demolition and other similar problems
 vishesh rup se ek ghatana, jiskaa bahut prachaar hua, main america raajnneetijna jon sijentheler kii jeevani ke bare main galat jaankaree daal di gayi or chaar maheene tak iskaa pataa nahin lagaaya ja sakaa

 do you know xxrep 13 
 Who wrote that? "" No, we don't know ", Jimmy said
 Some critics claim that Wikipedia's open structure makes it easy for Internet tyrants, advertisers and people who want to attack
 america pratinidhi sabha or vishesh hit ke samoohon sahit sanghathanon ke dwaara die gaye lekhon main rajanithik pariprekshya shaamil kiya gaya he, or sanghathan jaise microsoft ne vishesh lekhon par kaam karne ke liye vittiya bhatte dene kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 These issues have been poorly presented mainly by Stephen Colbert in the Colbert Report

 Confidence is created by observing the actions of other people in the community, for which the goods and complementary interests of the people are explored
 " Economist Tyler Cowen writes, "if i had to think that Wikipedia's journal articles on economics were true or whether media articles were true, i would choose Wikipedia, i wouldn't have to think much about it
" He remarks that many traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases

 However, they also warn that errors are often found on Internet sites and academics and experts should be vigilant to rectify them, farvari 2007 main, da harvard crimson akhbaar main ek lekh main kaha gaya ki harvard vishvavidhyalay main kuch professor apane paathyakram main vikipedia ko shaamil karte hai, lekin vikipedia kaa upyog karne main unki avadharana main matbhed he
 In June 2007, Michael Gorman, former president of the American Library Association, along with Google, embraced Wikipedia, and said academics who support the use of Wikipedia "are intellectually equivalent to a dietitian who is, among other things, Big Max
" Let's recommend a continuous diet
 " He also said that "a generation of intellectually inactive people who are unable to move beyond the internet" is being generated in universities
 unki shikaayat he ki web aadhaarit strot us adhik durlabh paathya ko seekhney se roak rahe hai jo yaa to keval dastavejon main miltaa he yaa sabskripshan-only websites par miltaa he
 In the same article, Jenny Fry commented on Wikipedia's academic education: "you cannot say that children are intellectually lazy because they are using the Internet, while academics on the other hand are using search engines in their research
" Huh
 antar yah he ki unhen jo bhi unhen praapt ho rahaa he, vah adhikarik he yaa nahin or iske bare main jatil hone kaa unhen adhik anubhav he
 Children need to be told how to use the Internet in an important and appropriate way
 " The Wikipedia community has tried to improve the credibility of Wikipedia
 angreji bhashaa ke vikipedia ne moolyankan paimaane kii shuruyaat kii jisase lekh kii gunvattta kii jaanch kii jaati he; anya sanskarnon ne bhi ise apana liya he
 About 2500 articles in English have passed the set of criteria to reach the highest rank of "featured Article" status; Such articles provide complete and well written coverage about their subject, which is supported by many peer reviewed publications
 zarman vikipedia, lekhon ke "sthir sanskarnon" ke rakh rakhaav kii ek pranali kaa pareekshan kar rahaa he, taaki yah ek pathak ko lekh ke un sanskarnon ko dekhne main madad kare jo vishisht samikshaon se hokar guzar chuke hai

 The Wikipedia community has established "a bureaucracy of sorts", which "includes a clear power structure that gives voluntary administrators the authority of editorial control
" vikipedia ke samudaay ko "panth kii tarah " ke rup main bhi varnit kiya gaya he, haalaanki ise hameshaa puri tarah se nakaaratmak abhidhaan ke saath is tarah se varnit nahin kiya gaya he, or anubhavheen upyogkartaaon ko samyojit karne kii asafalataa ke liye isaki aalochana kii jaati he
 Editors of good standing in the community can run one of several levels of volunteer stewardship; It starts with "administrator", a group of privileged users who have the ability to delete pages, prevent article changes and block users' edits in the event of demolition trends or editorial disputes
