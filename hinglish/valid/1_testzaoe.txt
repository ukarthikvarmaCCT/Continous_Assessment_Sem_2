 Mammography is the process of using a less extended amount of X-rays for human breast examination and is used as a tool to identify and detect disease
 stan chithran kaa lakshya stan cancer kaa shuruuaati daur main hi pataa lagaana he or yah saamanyat: kuch khaas tarah ke punjon or / yaa choti koshikaon kaa pataa lagaakar kiya jaataa he
 Mammography is believed to reduce mortality from breast cancer
 kam jokhim vaali kisi anya chithran takanic vikaas ab tak nahin hua he, lekin stan aatm pariksha or chikitsak ke pareekshan ko stan kii niyamit dekhbhaal ke aavashyak hisse maane gayi hai
 Many countries are encouraged to adopt routine mammography as a screening method for older women for early detection of breast cancer
 sanyukt rajya america priventive services task force 50 se 74 aayu varg kii mahilaon ke liye har 2 saal par naidanik stan pareekshan ke saath yaa iske bina mammography screening kii sifarish karata he
 Overall it has been found that clinical trials showed a relatively low 20% mortality rate from breast cancer, but the two highest-quality trials did not show a decrease in mortality
 In 2000, breast images became controversial after a newspaper published the results and published the results of two studies of the highest quality
 anya sabhi eks-re kii tarah stan chitra main chitra banane ke liye vikiran ko ynit karne kii khuraaq kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The radiologist then analyzes all abnormal findings
 haddiyon kii radiography kii tulana main lambii or der tak pravaahit kii jane vaali tarangon vaale eks-re kaa upyog aam he
 At this time, mammography is also preferred with physical breast testing for early breast cancer disease studies
 Ultrasound, ductography, positron emission mammography and magnetic resonance imaging are complementary to mammography
 saamanyat: ultrasound kaa upyog mammography se praapt yaa is prakriya se nahin chune yogya punjon ke aage ke moolyankan ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Some institutions still use ductograms for leakage of blood from the nipple or nipple, if the disease is not detected by breast imagery
 sandigdh nishkarshon ke aage ke moolyankan ke liye saath hi stan cancer ke gyaat marijon main surgery se pehle ke pareekshan ke liye emarai upyogi ho saktaa he, taaki un atirikt utakon kaa pataa lagaaya ja sake, jo surgery kii disha badal sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye stan se surgery ke jariye ganth nikaal diye jane se lekar puure stan ko katkar nikaal dene tak

 The false negative rate in mammography is at least 10 percent
 yah aanshik rup se isliye hota he ki ghaney utak cancer ko dhank lete hai, saath hi yah bhi tathy he ki stan chithran par cancer kii upasthiti saamaanya utakon se aachhadit ho jaati he
 During the procedure, the breast is compressed through a dedicated mammography unit
 samanaantar plate sampeedan se chitra kii gunvattta badhaane ke liye stan ke utakon ko samtal kiya jaataa he or utakon kii motaai kam hone se eks-re bheetar tak pahunchati hai or isse vikaran kaa bikharaav kam hota he
 Due to those plates the required radiation volume can be reduced and the breast is kept stable
 mammography kii screening main stan kaa sir se lekar pair tak kii chhavi or tirchhi chhavi donon lee jaati hai
 Clinical mammography may include other images, including geometrically expanded and contraction of that site of a particular area of apprehension
 durgandhanashak, telcome powder yaa loshan eks-re calcium sthal ke rup main dikh sakate hai, isliye pariksha ke din mahilaon ko inke upyog ke liye hatotsahit kiya jaataa he
 Until a few years ago, mammography was typically performed with screen film cassettes
 ab, mammography digital detectaron ke jariye hone lagi he, jise phul field digital mammography kaha jaataa he
 The first MMDM system was approved by the FDA in 2000 in the US
 yah pragati saamaanya radiology kii tulana main kuch varsh baad hui he
 This is due to several factors: 1 march 2010 tak sanyukt rajya america or iske kshetron kii suvidhaayen pradaan karanevaali 62 pratishat agenciyon main kam se kam ek emmendm unit hai
 The figure includes computerized radiography units at the FDA
 pichley kai varshon main "pareekshan" prakriya kaaphi aupchaarik ho gai he
 This typically includes screening mammography, diagnostic mammography, and biopsy when necessary and is often performed via stereo tactic core biopsy or biopsy as directed by ultrasound
 ek stan chitra kii jaanch ke baad kuch mahilaon ke liye chintaa ke vishay ho sakate hai, jise stan chitra kii screening dwaara praapt soochna ke jariye dur nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 They are then called back for "diagnostic mammograms"
 is vaakyansh kaa matlab anivaaryat: samasya ke hal ke liye kiya gaya mammogram he
 During this session, radiologists will have to monitor every additional film, as they are taken by a technologist

 ateet main, biopsy sthaneey yaa saamaanya anaesthesia ke jariye aksar saamaanya surgery ke liye kii jaati thi
 The vast majority of people now use ultrasound or breast imaging guidance to ensure that the affected area is biospied
 in mukhya biopsayon main keval sthaneey sangyaaharan kii jarurat hoti he, jaise ki daant ke upachaar kii prakriya main kiya jaataa he
 One study suggests that liver cancer biopsy via needle will rarely increase the spread of cancer and the same is the case with breast cancer biopsy via needle
 naidanik memmogram ke liye waapas bulaaye jane ke baad aksar mahilaayein kaaphi pareshaan ho jaati hai
 Most of these show false positive results
 ye anumaanit aankade is baat kii jaankaree main madad karte han: har 1,000 america mahilaon, jinaki screening kii gai, main kareeb 7% waapas naidanik satr ke bulaai jaayengi 
 in vyaktiyon main se 10 ko biopsy ke liye bheja jayega, shesh 60 main gaiyr-nuksaandeh kaaran paye jate hai
 In 10 cases sent for biopsy, cancer will be found only in 3
5 percent, while in 6
5 percent it will not be found
 Of the 3
5 percent of people suffering from cancer, only 2 will have early-stage cancer, which will inevitably be cured after treatment
 Mammogram results are often placed in the by-raids assessment category, also known as the "by-raids Score"
 ye shreniyan 0 se 6 shrenee ke bich hoti hai
 Mammograms in Britain are measured on a scale between 1–5
 haalanki stan cancer kii screening ke liye mammography ekmaatr tarika he, jisase jaan bachaai ja sakati he, par yah ekadam sateek nahin he
 The number of cancer patients who have escaped detection by mammography is typically 10% to 30%
 iskaa matlab yah he ki prati 1 xxrep 5 0 mahilaon main se jin 350 mahilaon main stan cancer paaya jaataa he, unamem se kareeb 35 se 105 main mammography dwaara cancer kaa pataa nahin lagaaya ja sakaa
 cancer kaa pataa nahin lag paane ke kaarnon main paryvekshak kii chook shaamil he, lekin ekaadhik baar aisa hota he ki stan cancer stan ke duusare ghaney utakon main chhip jaataa he or mammogram kii purvyaapee samiksha ke baad bhi nahin dikh paata
 iske alaava, stan cancer ke ek rup lobular cancer ke viksit hone tarika aisa he, jo mammogram par apni chaaya daal detaa he or jisase unhen stan ke saamaanya utakon se pruthak karnaa sambhav nahin hota
 Computer-assisted diagnosis is being tested to reduce the number of cancer patients missed by mammograms
 ek pareekshan main computer ne 71% maamalon kii pahchaan kii, jinka pataa lagane main chikitsak chuk gayi the
 However, computers attracted attention twice as much to cancerous components as compared to physicians
 mammogram ke ek bade set ke ek duusare adhyayan main, ek computer ne chah biopsy kii sifarish kii, jabaki chikitsakon ne aisa nahin kiya tha
 All these six cases were found to be cancerous, which would have been ignored
 In general, the specificity of CAD systems in screening of mammography is quite low and comparatively low reading capability is also lacking, although computer-aided detection effect induces the sensitivity and specificity of screening for mammography
 swasthya praudyogiki akalan, 9 )
 Such data is increasing, which suggests that CAD can detect cancer in some additional areas and it should be kept in this perspective
 The rate of additional detection was 20%, thus CAD could help detect cancer out of an additional 8 out of 10,000 women groups, with 40 having cancer
 cancer ke ye atirikt prakaar praarambhik avasthaa vaale or chote ho sakate hai
 There was no such data until 2006, which showed that after detecting these additional cancer patients, their survival rate was affected
 Some believe that this type of cancer is likely to be detected in the next screening itself, is still at diagnostics level and therefore it remains to be proven that CAD will eventually have any effect on the patient's outcome
 1 oktober 2008 ko british shodhakartaaon dwaara jari adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki ek chikitsak dwaara ek baar padhane ke sangyojan ke rup main siedi kaa upyog ek chikitsak dwaara do baar padhane jitna laabhadaayak ho saktaa he
 The study of 31000 women, the largest study ever, showed that one physician had a nearly identical disease detection rate with CAD compared to two physicians
 jin 227 cancer rogiyon kaa pataa chalaa, unamem se do alag-alag chikitsakon dwaara pataa lagaaye gayi cancer ke 199 maamalon main siedi vidhi se dwaara pataa lagaaye gayi rogiyon kii sankhya sirf ek kam thi
 good kisi bhi chaanbin prakriya kaa lakshya baari sankhya main rogiyon kii jaanch or unamem se sambhavit gambhir haalat vaale rogiyon kaa pataa lagaana he
 These patients are referred for further usually higher intensity testing
 is prakaar screening pariksha kaa makasad nirnaayak nahin he, balki iskaa makasad ucch samvedansheeltaa he, jisase kisi cancer kaa pataa lagane main chook na ho jaye
 is ucch samvedansheeltaa kaa parinaam apekshaakrit badi sankhya main aaye parinaamon ke rup main hota he, jisase rog ke bina rogi sandigdh ke rup main mana jaataa he
 This is true of mammography
 ek jaanch satr ke baad rogiyon ko ek aage ke pareekshan ke liye waapas bulaayaa jaataa he to kabhi-kabhi ise "galat sakaaratmak" or ek trutipurna sanket kaha jaataa he
 In fact, it is necessary to call many healthy patients for further investigation, so that cancer patients can be detected as much as possible
 shodh se pataa chalata ki galat sakaaratmak stan chitra mahilaon kii khushhaali or vyavhaar ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Some women with false positive results may return for more routine screening and may have increased rates of breast self-examination
 haalanki, galat sakaaratmak parinaam praapt karne vaali kuch mahilaon ko stan cancer hone kii ashanka ke bare main chintaa, pareshaani or dukh ho saktaa he or aisa bhav kai varshon tak rah saktaa he
 At the same time, there may be a missed or "false negative" rate in tumor detection in the breast image
 nakaaratmak khoj ke aankadon kaa pataa lagaana saadhaarant: isliye mushkil he kyonki us har mahila kaa mastectomies nahin hota he, jinke paas sahi-sahi galat nakaaratmak dar vaali mammography he
 Inaccurate negative rate estimates rely on further intensive investigation of a large number of patients for many years
 yah vyavhaar main kaaphi kathin he, kyonki kai mahilaayein niyamit rup se mammography ke liye waapas nahin aatin, jisase yah pataa lagaana mushkil ho jaataa he ki unhen cancer hua tha yaa nahin
 dow shamooel es ipstin ne apni pustak da politics of cancer main ne daawa kiya he ki 40 se 49 varsh kii mahilaon main prayek mammography main chaar main se ek mahila main cancer kaa pataa lagane main chook hui
 shodhakartaaon ne paaya he ki yuva mahilaon main stan utak kaaphi ghaney hote hai or ganth kaa pataa lagaana mushkil hota he
 For this reason, inaccurate negative reports in breast imagery done before menopause can occur up to two times
 yahi kaaran he ki britain main screening kaarykram main 50 varsh kii umr tak mahilaon ko screening kaarykram ke liye mahilaon ko bulaanaa nahin shuru kiya jaataa
 The importance of omissions in the discovery of cancer is unclear, especially if the woman gets breastmilk every year
 sambandhit sthiti par kiye gayi anusandhan se pataa chalata he ki chote cancer, jinpar bhale hi turant nidanmoolak kaam nahin shuru kiya gaya, lekin kai varshon kii avadhi tak nigaraanee rakhi gai, unke achche parinaam dikhe
 3184 mahilaon ke ek samooh kaa mammogram kiya gaya, jinhen aupchaarik rup se "sambhavit rup se shuruuaati" ke rup main vargeekrut kiya gaya tha
 This classification of patients is clearly not common, but it does include some areas of minor concern
 in parinaamon main rogayon kii biopsy nahin kii gai, par teen saal ke liye har chah maheene par mammography ke nateezon par najar rakhi gai, taaki koi parivartan nahin hone guarantee pai ja sake
 in 3184 mahilaon main se 17 ko cancer tha
 Most importantly, they were still in the early stages of 0 or 1 when they were detected
 paanch saal ke upachaar ke baad in 17 mahilaon main se kisi main punrariti ke saboot nahin the
 Thus, early-stage small cancers, although not diagnosed immediately, are still fully curable
 
 Radiation side effects associated with mammography are a potential risk of screening
 is kuprabhav kaa khatra sabase adhik navayuvatiyon ko hota he
 The largest study on radiation side effects from mammography concluded that radiation-induced breast cancer was modest for women 40 years of age or older, particularly with a benefit-to-risk ratio compared to the potential benefit of mammographic screening 48
5 people were rescued compared to one, who died due to the ill effects of radiation
 Organizations such as the National Cancer Institute and the United States Preventive Task Force take such risks into account when formulating screening guidelines
 bahusankhyak swasthya visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki 35 se kam umr kii kam jokhim vaali mahilaon ke liye stan cancer kaa khatra itnaa zyada nahin he ki unhen vikiran ke sambhavit kuprabhav kaa khatra uthaanaa pade
 is kaaran se or 35 se kam umr kii mahilaon main stan kii vikiran samvedansheeltaa sambhawatah zyada umr kii mahilaon kii tulana main adhik he, isliye zyaadaatar radiologist 40 se kam umr kii mahilaon kii mammography nahin karte
 haalanki, agar kisi vishesh rogi main cancer kaa mahatvapurn jokhim he, to mammography phir bhi mahatvapurn ho sakati he
 Often, radiologists try to avoid mammography by using ultrasound or MRI imaging
 mammography or 40 se 55 ke bich umr kii mahilaon ke bare main aankade sabase vivaadaaspad rahe hai
 The Canadian National Breast Cancer Study in 1992 showed that mammography did not have a positive effect on the mortality of women aged 50 to 60
 yah adhyayan haalanki, sirf yah parinaam hasil karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Critics of the study said that it had very serious flaws, which proved these results to be wrong
 is baat ke bhi saboot hai, jinase spasht rup se pataa chalata he ki mahilaon kii jaanch ke dauraan cancer kii pahchaan ke liye jarurat se zyada kavayad kii gai
 Such cancers never affect these women throughout their lifetime
 When 2000 women underwent a 10-year diagnostic procedure, 10 of them underwent an excessive diagnostic procedure to diagnose breast cancer and underwent unnecessary therapy to save lives
 haalanki 40 or 50 ke bich kii mahilaon kii screening ab bhi vivaadaaspad he, sabooton kii sankhya sanket karti he ki rog ke shuru main hi pataa lagane sandarbh main iske thode laabh hai
 Currently, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Radiology encourage women between the ages of 40 and 49 to undergo mammography every 2 years

 aalochana yaa samalochna kisi vastu / vishay kii, uske lakshya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, uske gun-dosha evam upyuktatta kaa vivechan karne wali saahitiyik vidha he
 The beginning of Hindi criticism is considered to be from the Bharatendu era of the late 19th century
 'samalochna' kaa shabdic arth he - 'acchhee tarah dekhnaa'
 The word 'criticism' is made of 'luch' metal
 'luch' kaa arth he 'dekhnaa'
 The words review and criticism also have the same meaning
 angreji ke 'critisism' shabd ke samanaarthi rup main 'aalochana' kaa vyavhaar hota he
 The word criticism is also used for 'commentary-interpretation' and 'poetry-theory' as practiced in Sanskrit, but Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is clear that modern criticism is something independent of Sanskrit's poetry-theory
 aalochana kaa kaary he kisi sahityak rachana kii acchhee tarah pariksha karke uske rup, ganu or arthvyastha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has given the definition of criticism in these words: arthath aalochana kaa kartavya sahityak kriti kii vishleshan parak vyakhya he
 Criticism analyzes those elements of the synthesis of literature from the life and spirit of life
 sahitya main jahaan raagatatv pradhan he vahaan aalochana main buddhi tatv
 Criticism also assesses historical, social, political conditions and pupils and discusses their impact on literature
 vyaktigat ruchi ke aadhaar par kisi kriti kii ninda yaa prashansa karnaa aalochana kaa dharm nahin he
 Methodism and system are important in criticism for the interpretation and analysis of work
 aalochana karte samay aalochak apane vyaktigat raag-dwesh, ruchi-aruchi se tabhi batch saktaa he jab paddati kaa anusaran kare, vah tabhi vastunishth hokar sahitya ke prati nyaay kar saktaa he
 From this point of view, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is considered the best critic in Hindi
 aalochana karte samay jin manyataon or paddatiyon ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he, unke anusaar aalochana ke prakaar viksit ho jate hai
 Four types of review are generally accepted: - saiddhanthik aalochana main sahitya ke siddhanton par vichaar hota he
 In it, ancient classical poetry - Rasa, Alankar etc
 and modern beliefs and rules of literature are mainly disseminated
 saiddhanthik aalochana main vichaar kaa bindu yah he ki sahitya kaa maandand shastreey he yaa aitihaasik
 The classical form of a norm is static and unchangeable, but considering the criteria as a historical category, their form is variable and developmental
 donon prakaar kii saiddhanthik aalochanaayen uplabdh hai
 But now the importance of the same theoretical criticism which assumes development in the historical process of elements and rules of literature
 nishchit siddhanton keadhar par jab sahitya ke ganu-dosha, shreshth-nikrusht kaa nirnay kar diya jaataa he tab use nirnayaatmak aalochana kehete hai
 It is also considered a type of moral criticism
 iskaa mukhya swabhaav nyaayadhish kii tarah sahityak kritiyon par nirnay dena he
 Such criticism often uses the principle mechanically
 isliye nirnayaatmak aalochana kaa mahatva kam ho jaataa he
 Although creating a sense of value or superior literature and inferior literature is one of the main religions of criticism, but it is not possible by mechanical use of principles
 'hindi sahitya kosh' main nirnayaatmak aalochana ke vishay main bataaya gaya he: Thus judgment in criticism is not the point of dispute as much as the method adopted for decision
 jasai, ramachandra shukla kii aalochana main mulya nirnay he, lekin uskaa tarika srujanaatmak he, yantric nahin
 Judicial criticism lacks flexibility in both value and method
 is aalochana main kavy kaa jo prabhaav aalochak keman par padataa he use vah sajile pad-vinyas main vyast kar detaa he
 Personal interest is main in this
 prabhavabhivyajunk samalochna koi thaȥk-ǒthakaane kii vastu nahin he
 Neither is its value in the field of knowledge nor in the field of emotion

 Aiso Bado Mahant Kahavi॥ "according to Kedarnath Dwivedi who studied Kabir Panth, there is no clear evidence that Kabir himself founded the Panth
 kabir kii mrityu ke pashchaat unke shishyon ne yah kaary kiya
 Dwivedi, referring to the background of the founding of the Kabir Panth, writes, "it is said that Nanak was the first among the saints to initiate the creed and he also made some rules for it
 sambhawatah nanakdev ke ananthar hi kabir panth kii sthapana hui hogi
 


 Dadupanthi Raghavdas in his handwritten book Bhaktamala called Dharmadas a disciple of Kabir
 chhattisgadhi shakha kaa itihaas prastut karte samay aage chalakar dharmadas ke aavirbhaav kii tithi satrahavin shatabdi ke pratham charan ke lagbhag siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 It was probably Dharmadas who first took concrete steps to broaden the cult
 " In India, there are mainly three branches of Kabir Panth
 kaashi vaali shakha, dhanauti vaali bhagatahi shakha or chhattisgarh vaali shakha
 The founders of these branches are believed to be Shruti Gopal Sahab, Bhagwan Gosain and Muktamani Naam Sahab respectively

 Green computing is important for all types of computers
 green computing yaa green iti, paryaavaran kii drushti se tikaoo computing yaa iti ko sanderbhit karti he
 , An article titled San Murugesan Green defines the field of computing as "the study, design, manufacture, use and disposal of computers, servers and related devices - such as monitors, printers, storage devices and networks and communications systems, and Practice - which is efficient and effective and the effect on the environment is negligible or negligible
 " green computing ke lakshya green chemistry ke samaan hai; khatarnaak padaarthon ke upyog ko kam karnaa, utpaada kii jivan avadhi ke dauraan urja kii bachat ko adhiktam karnaa, tathaa mrit padaarthon tathaa kaarkaanon ke kachare kii ricycling prakriya yaa jaivik apghaton ko badhaava dena

 Some initiatives place the onus on the manufacturer to dispose of their equipment after the need is over: This is called the extended manufacturer responsibility model
 khatarnaak padaarthon kii kami par, europea sangh ke 2002 / 95 / EC or bekaar bijli or electronic upkarnon par 002 / 96 / EC nirdeshon ke anusaar 1 july 2006 se bazaar main rakhe jane vaale sabhi electronic upkarnon main baari dhaatuon or agni pratirodhakon jaise polibrominated biphenl or polibrominated diphenl ether kaa pratisthaapan aavashyak he
 Manufacturers are responsible for collecting and recycling old equipment according to the instructions
 vartmaan main 26 america rajya hai jinhone rajya ke anusaar aprachlit computaron or kanjumar electronics upkarnon ke liye ricycling kaarykram sthapit kiye hai
 The official rule requires either an "advance recovery fee" to be levied on each unit sold in retail, or the manufacturer's equipment required to be disposed of
 green iti ko badhaava: siddhant or vyavhaar naamak lekh main, san murugesan green computing ke kshetra ko is prakaar paribhaashit karte hai "computaron, sarvaron or sambandhit upkarnon-jaise ki monitor, printer, storaz upkaran or network tathaa sanchaar sambandhi pranaaliyon kii dizining, nirmaan, prayog tathaa niptaan, kaa adhyayan tathaa abhyaas-jo kushal va prabhaavshaalee he tathaa jiskaa vaataavaran par padane vaala prabhaav na ke baraabar yaa naganya he
 "murugesan describes four ways that he describes the environmental impact of computing: green use, green disposal, green design, and green manufacturing
 aadhunik iti system logon, network or hardware ke jatil mishran par nirbhar hai; isliye green computing prayaas ke rup main in sabhi kshetron ko shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 Solutions reflecting end user satisfaction, management restructuring, regulatory compliance and return on investment are also needed

 " gartner kehete hai ki ek pisi ke jivan chakra main prayukt hone vaale 70% prakritik sansadhano kaa prayog pisi nirmaan prakriya main hota he
 
 Therefore, the greatest contribution to green computing can be made by prolonging the lifespan of the devices
 gartner kii ek or report "utpaada ko unnat karne kii kshamta tathaa praturupaktaa ke saath uski dderghaayu kii talash" karne kii sifarish karti he
 For example, building a new PC to upgrade has more impact on the environment than a new RAM module, a common upgrade that does not require the user to purchase a new computer
 kisi bhi computing kaary ke liye computer sansadhano kii maatra par elgorithm kii dakshata kaa prabhaav padataa he or lekhan prograamon main kai dakshataayen maujuud hai
 Now that computers are available in large numbers and hardware prices have fallen compared to energy costs, the energy savings and environmental impact of computing systems and programs have attracted more attention
 harvard ke ek sakal-bhautik vigyaani, elex visnar gros dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan main anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki ausat google khoj 7 gram carbon dioxide chhodti hai
 But according to Google the figure is controversial, saying that a typical search produces only 0

 elgorithm, root data se data kendron par bhi prayog main laai ja sakati hai, jahaan bijli kam kharchili he
 Researchers at MIT, Kerniz Malone University and Akamai have tested an energy allocation algorithm that sends traffic to a designated location with the cheapest energy cost
 shodhakartaaon ke anusaar unki prastaavit elgorithm ko lagu karne par urja laagat main 40 pratishat kii bachat kii ja sakati he
 Simply put, this approach does not actually reduce the amount of energy being used; This only reduces costs for the company using it

 a similar approach has been used to reduce energy use by diverting traffic away from heat-sensing data centers, causing computers to shut down to avoid the use of air conditioning
 computer vartualigeshan computer sansadhano ko kam karne se sambandhit he, jaise - bhautik hardware ke ek set par do yaa adhik taarkik computer system chalaane kii prakriya

 With virtualization, a system administrator could add multiple physical systems by removing the original hardware on virtual machines of a single powerful system, which reduced energy and cooling consumption
 Many commercial companies and open-source projects now transition to virtual computing Software packages to enable intel korporation or eemdi ne bhi abhaasi computing ko suvidhajanak banane ke liye, X86 anudesh set ke anusaar apni prayek sipiu line ke liye properitary vartualigeshan anhansament banaaye hai
 Terminal servers have also been used in green computing

 nabhikeey astr yaa parmaanu bam ek visphotak yukti he jisaki vidhvansak shakti kaa aadhaar nabhikeey abhikriya hoti he
 It can be made by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission or by the combination of both these types of nuclear reactions
 dono hi prakaar kii abhikriya ke parinamswaroop thode hi saamagree se baari maatra main urja utpann hoti he
 Today's nuclear weapon, slightly larger than one thousand kilos, can generate as much energy as it can generate from conventional explosives of several billion kilos
 nabhikeey hathiyaar mahavinashkari hathiyaar kahe jate hai
 The most powerful explosive used in World War II was the name 'blockbuster'
 iske nirmaan main tab tak gyaat prabalatam visphotak trinitrotoluin kaa 11 ton prayukt hua tha
 The first atomic bomb, which was 2000 times more powerful than this explosive, was detonated by T
N
 T
 was equivalent to an explosion of 22,000 tons
 ab to pratham parmaanu bam se bahut adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam bane hai
 The detonating substance in a nuclear bomb is uranium or plutonium
 uranium yaa plutonium ke parmaanu vikhandan se hi shakti praapt hoti he
 For this, neutrons are struck in the nucleus of the atom
 is prahaar se hi bahut badi maatra main urja praapt hoti he
 This process is called physicist nuclear fission
 parmaanu ke nabhik ke abhyantar main jo neutron hote hai unheen se neutron mukt hote hai
 These neutrons strike other atoms and cause fragmentation again
 ye phir anya parmaanuon kaa vikhandan karte hai
 This is how chain actions begin
 parmaanu bam kii aniyantrit shrunkhlaa kriyaaon ke falswaroop bheeshan prachandta ke saath parmaanu kaa visphot hota he
 Many isotopes of uranium are known
 saamaanya uranium main 99
3 pratishat you-238 or 0
7 pratishat you-235 rahete hai
 The fragmentation of U-238 is not as easy as the fragmentation of U-235
 you-235 main you-238 kii apeksha teen neutron kam rahete hai
 It is due to this lack of neutrons that fragmentation of U-235 occurs easily
 anya vikhandaneey padaarth jo parmaanu bam main kaam aate hai ve you-233 or plutonium-239 hai
 a nuclear explosion requires critical codes of fissile material
 shrunkhlaa kriya ke chaalu karne ke liye kranthik sanhati nunatam maatra he
 If the amount of fissile material is less than the critical code, then the neutron will only continue to crumble
 maatra ke dhire dhire badhaane se ek samay aisi avasthaa aegi jab kam se kam ek unmukt neutron ek nae parmaanu par prahaar kar uskaa vikhandan kar degaa
 On reaching such a state, the fragmentation process starts running automatically
 kranthik sanhati kii maatra gopneey he
 Only those nations that make nuclear bombs know and do not tell others
 yadi you-235 kii kranthik sanhati 20 pound he to das das pound do jagah lene se shrunkhlaa kriya chaalu nahin hogi
 Taking 20 pounds together will start the chain operation
 shrunkhlaakriya main neutron kii sankhya badi shighrata se badhati he
 Fission in a nuclear bomb raises the heat of uranium and other substances adjacent to it very quickly
 dhatvik uranium badi unchi daab or taap par tapadipt gas main parinat ho jaataa he
 The temperature of the explosive body is 10,00,00,000 ° C
 Wakes up to itane unche taap par uranium kii thapi hat jaati he
 Then the whole body explodes with great intensity
 parmaanu bam ke visphutit hone par aadhaat tarangen utpann hoti hai jo dhwani kii gati se bhi adhik gati se chaaron ore failati he
 When the atomic bomb is detonated above the earth, the waves hit the earth and rise up and create a new shock that spreads up and down intensely
 bam sphot kaa centre tatkaal tapt hokar nirvaat utpann karata he
 The surrounding cold air rushes to fill the vacuum
 is prakaar parmaanu bam se gharon par aghat padane se ve tut jate hai
 Explosive uranium turns into other elements, radioactive rays emanate from it and destroy living cells and destroy them
 bam kaa vinashikari kaary aghat tarangon, vedhi kirnon tathaa atyadhik ooshmaa utpaadan ke kaaran hota he
 Hydrogen bombs are a variety of nuclear bombs
 hydrogen bam yaa ech-bam adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam hota he
 It requires isotopic du terium and tritium of hydrogen
 parmaanuon ke sanlayan karne se bam kaa visphot hota he
 For this fusion, the temperature is very high, about 500,00,000 ° C
 Is required
 yah taap surya ke ooshnatam bhaag ke taap se bahut unchaa he
 Atomic bombs can achieve such high temperature
 america, england, rus, china va bharat ne hydrogen bam kaa pareekshan kiya
 North Korea is also believed to have made such a dangerous bomb
 jab parmaanu bam aavashyak taap utpann karata he tabhi hydrogen parmaanu sanlayit hote hai
 This fusion produces heat and powerful rays that turn hydrogen into helium
 1922 i
 main pehle pahal pataa laga tha ki hydrogen parmaanu ke visphot se bahut adhik urja utpann ho sakati he
 Heavy hydrogen called deuterium was invented in 1932 and heavy hydrogen called triterium in 1934
 1950 i
 main sanyukt rajya america ke raashtrapati tru main ne hydrogen bam taiyaar karne kaa aadesh diya
 For this, a large factory was established in 1951 in South Carolina
 1953 i
 main raashtrapati ijenhabar ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki TNT ke lakhon ton ke baraabar hydrogen bam taiyaar ho gaya he
 In 1955 AD, the Soviet Union tested hydrogen bombs
 china or france ne bhi hydrogen bam ke visphot kiye hai
 Mara was a demon who made several attempts to misguide Gautama Buddha with the help of beautiful women

 afars tab paraamarsh ke liye oracl kii bhavishyavaanee sunate hai, jo apana farmaan detaa he ki carnia ke vakt spartaon kaa yuddh par janaa sahi nahin hoga
 Frustrated and enraged, Leonidas returns, followed by a messenger of Zerkys, who rewards the enforcers for their camaraderie
 haalaanki afars kii ijaajat ke bina bhi apni sparton sipaahiyon ko lamaband karte hue, leonidas unamem chune hue teen sau behtareen sainikon ko bahaane se apana angrakshak bataakar; arcadiens ke raste le chalata he
 Upon reaching Thermopylae, they erect a wall of rocks and heave the corpses of the slain Pharisees among them, this action makes the Persian messenger angry
 unheen main se stelios, naam kaa ek sambhraant sparta sainik, un farsiyon ko seemaa se vaapis jane ko kahata he or xerqies ke naam par isi tarah baanh kaat daalane kii sajaa kii chetavanee detaa he
 Meanwhile, Leonidas meets Affialtis, a disfigured Sparta resident whom his parents had escaped to save him from infant killing according to Sparta's law
 efialtis apane pita kii isi mukti ke liye vah leonidas se fouj main behaal hone kii darkhaast karata he, lekin leonidas use chetata he ki vah farsiyon ke liye kabhi bhi bali kaa shikaar ho saktaa he jiske chalate puri sparta fouj ghir sakati he
 Taking pity on him, Leonidas refuses, seeing his physical disability because he cannot lift his shield as high as he needs; For which there should be a necessary possibility in the creation of military armament, Affialtis is very upset to hear this
 jald hi vah jang shuru ho jaati he jab sparton hathiyaar samarpan se inkaar kar dete hai
 He enjoys the advantage of the tight paths of a single entryway, and by his superior fighting skills, the Spartans would also push back a wave of forces from across the Persians at their own pace
 yuddh ke thamane dauraan, xerqies khud leonidas se milakar aatmasamarpan karne ko kahata he, uski mulk ke prati vafadari ko dekh badale main daulat or takat kaa nyauta dene ko maan jaataa he; leonidas yah peshkash thukraata he or usee ke shoorveer samajhane vaale sipaahiyon ko ghatiya darje kaa bataakar xerqies ko banaavati kahkar khilli udaata hai
 In response, Zerkias sends his advance defenders to fight, who become immortal after nightfall
 haalaanki kuchhek spartaon ke maare jane baad bhi, ve bade parakramee se un amar rakshakon haraa daalate he 
 Then on the second day, Zerkias calls for a new military consignment from Asia and other Persian urban countries, including a war elephant to crush all Sparta in one blow, but all methods fail
 is bich, efialtis us khufia raste kaa bhed xerqies ko bataa detaa he is shart par ki use bhi daulat, aisho-aaraam or ek vardi di jaae
 The arcadians soon discover this betrayal of the apialtis, but the Spartans remain there
 leonidas tab jakhmi lekin anicchhuk dilios ko vaapis sparta jane kaa hukum dete he or yahan ghatit har vaakye ko har kisi se, "vijay gaatha" kii tarah waakif karaane kehete hai
 In Sparta, Queen Gorgo urges the Spartan committee to send additional forces to help those 300 soldiers
 lekin bhrasht raajnneetijna theran, jiske mutabik yah samiti uske hi "haq" main bolegi tathaa yahaan tak kii rani sahiba par laanchhan daalata he, ki apni maang manwaane ke liye vah jismani sambandh se bhi gurej nahin karegi
 Seeing Theran being insulted against him in the current assembly, Gorgo loses his temper and fights in fury, with which Zerkias's gold-clad Ashrafis bag, hidden in his cloak, falls
 is beimaani ke khulaase par, sabhi saansadon kii sarvasammati se atirikt balon ko bhejne kii anumati mil jaati he
 On the third day, the Persian army, following Affialtis, besieges the Sparta, passing through his intelligence paths
 xerqies kaa senapati dubaara unase aatmasamarpan karne kii maang karte hai
 Leonidas almost reveals himself to be kneeling, when Stelios leaps onto his back and kills the commander
 kupit xerqies apane sipaahiyon ko hamale ke liye aadesh detaa he
 Leonidas stands up and throws a spear at Zerkys; Even in this slight lapse, a passing spear bites his face, biting his spear, proving that his so-called "king of the gods" is also mortal
 leonidas or uske bache khuche sparton ladaake bhi antim shaks se ladate hai kii aakhir main sabhi tiron kii bhayankar bauchhaar se maare jate hai
 Dilios returns to Sparta, concluding with the lecture at the assembly
 apane raja kii qurbaani se prerit hokar, unani apni 40,000 vishaal balavaan fouj or 10,000 spartao ke saath un farsiyon se aamane-saamne khadi hoti he
 Later, with his last speech commemorating those 300 men, the new captain of the Sparta army, Dilios, descends to Plattea's field to fight the Persians, and the film ends

 It was from here that his confrontation with the British began and he refused to accept the British order

 When such situation came, the British used to merge that state in their empire

 This policy also had a major role in the 1857 movement and many princely states participated in the freedom struggle, opposing various policies including this policy of the British
