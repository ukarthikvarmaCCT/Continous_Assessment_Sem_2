 yahi kaaran he ki apni antaratma kii shuddhi hetu pavitra snaan karne lakhon shraddhalu yahan aate hai
 From the spiritual point of view, the position of planets during the period of Ardh Kumbh is excellent for concentration and meditation

 There are two or three mythological stories about the celebration of Kumbh festival, the most popular of which is the fall of nectar drops from Kumbh, the nectar received from the sea churning by the gods and goddesses
 is katha ke anusaar maharishi durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran jab indra or anya devtaa kamjor ho gaye to daityon ne devataaon par akraman kar unhen parrast kar diya
 Then all the gods together went to Lord Vishnu and told him all the accounts
 tab bhagwaan vishnu ne unhe daityon ke saath milakar kshirsagar kaa manthan karke amrit nikaalane kii salaah di
 At the behest of Lord Vishnu, the entire deity tried to make a treaty with the demons to extract the nectar
 amrit kumbh ke nikalate hi devataaon ke ishaare se indraputra 'jayant' amrit-kalash ko lekar akaash main ud gaya
 The demons then pursued Jayant to take back the nectar as per the order of Shyagacharya and after intense exertion, they caught Jayant in the middle
 tatpashchaat amrit kalash par adhikaar jamaane ke liye dev-daanvon main baarah din tak aviraam yuddh hota rahaa
 During this interconnection, nectar drops fell from the urn at four places of the earth
 us samay chandramaa ne ghat se prasravan hone se, surya ne ghat footne se, guru ne daityon ke apharan se evam shani ne devendra ke bhay se ghat kii raksha kii
 To calm discord, God took the form of a siren and gave it amrit to everyone and gave them drink
 is prakaar dev-daanav yuddh kaa ant kiya gaya
 For the attainment of nectar, there was a continuous war between the dev-danavs for twelve days
 devataaon ke baarah din manushyon ke baarah varsh ke tulya hote hai
 Hence, Aquarius is also twelve
 unamem se chaar kumbh prithvi par hote hai or shesh aath kumbh devloak main hote hai, jinhen devgan hi praapt kar sakate hai, manushyon kii vahaan pahunch nahin he
 When the lunar-sunic planets guarding the current zodiacs are protected at the time when the Chandradikas protect the Kalash, then the sum of Aquarius is there, ie the year in which the Sun, Moon and Jupiter coincide
 That is, in the same year, in the sum of the same zodiac sign, Kumbh festival takes place wherever the nectar drops fell

 nirmal verma kii teen kahaniyon ‘dhoop kaa ek tukdaa’, ‘dedh inch upar’ or ‘veekend’ kii manch-prastuti devendra raaj ke nirdesan main kii gai thi
 These three stories are compiled in this collection
 teenon kahaniyon kii bhavbhumi or style lagbhag ek-jaisi he—teenon main ek-ek paatr he jo shuru se lekar ant tak ek lambaa samvaad bolta he, iske saath hi yah ek ahsaas bhi bana rahata he ki samvaad kii shuruuaat kisi duusare paatr ke saath hoti he, lekin yahan uski sthiti kaa koi arth nahin rahata, kyonki na jane kab yah samvaad maatr swa-kendrit hokar rah jaataa he
 Thus, these stories are stories of the characters interviewing themselves in moments of loneliness

 is prakaar ek maun, buudhe or apane main hi vyast paatr kii upasthiti ne is aurat ke akelepan ko bhi zyaada rekhaankit karti he
 Starting from a park, the storyline of the story changes in the woman's long dialogue with the context of her past — but without any change in those two benches, only certain areas or music underlined by light, and eventually by the solo actress An attempt has been made to capture the entire journey of the story itself
 dedh inch upar ‘dhoop kaa ek tukdaa’ jaise frem kii kahani hote hue bhi apane antim swaroop main yah usase bilkul hi alag hoti gai
 There are also two characters - one speaking and the other listening

 The old character of the story opens himself drinking beer
 prastutikaran ke bich-bich main use bear ‘sarv’ karne ke liye ek beyara he jo uski awaz par jab-jab bear kaa mag rakhane ko aata to anayas hi kahani ke drishy ko punah pub se jod detaa
 Weekend title story is related to 'swachintan' of the entire heroine of Puri

 hamaari ab tak ki samaj ke anusaar kan kwantum kshetron ke uttejan hai
 They have their own dynamics of interaction with other particles
 kan bhautikee ke kshetra main adhikansh ruchi moolbhoot kshetron main he
 The essence of fundamental fields and their dynamics is presented as Standard Model Theory
 isiliye kan bhautikee main adhiktar standard model ke mul kanon tathaa unke sambhavit vistaar ke bare main adhyan kiya jaataa he
 Modern particle physics research focuses on subatomic particles that include electrons forming protons, protons and neutrons from radioactive and scattering processes, such as photons, neutrinos, and muons, as well as exotic particles
 agar sahi rup main kahe to particle parishudhd bhotiki main ek ashuddh naam he kyo ki kan bhautikee kii gatiki quantum mechanics dwaara purnataa paribhaasith hoti he
 For example, in some experimental conditions this particle-particle duality appears, and in some places they present wave-like behavior
 ore takneekee bhashaa main kaahe to yah Hilbert space main quantum state dwaara varnit hote he, jo ki quantum field theory main bataaya gaya he
 According to particle physics scientists, the primary particles of particle physics are electrons and photons, and all of them are known that they also present a path-like phenomenon
 abhi tak gyaat sabhi kan tathaa unki persparik kriyaaye kwantum siddhant ke maanak model dawaara paribhaashit kii ja sakati he
 In the standard model, 17 types of initials are defined, 12 fermions, 4 vector bosons and one scalar boson
 ye praathmik kan un saikado tarah ke samgr kanon ko sanyojit kar sakate hai jinaki khoj 1960 se ab tak hui he
 The standard model has been successful in almost all experimental tests so far
 halaki vahut se can bhotikwaadi yah maanate he ki yah prakruti kaa ek adhuraa varnan maatr he, tathaa ore adhik sarabhoot siddhanto kii khoj abhi baki he
 a recent discovery of the mass of neutrinos has presented the first experimental deviation in the standard model
 can bhotiki vigyaanan ke bahut se sidhanto se prabhvit hota he, kuch can bhotikaudi newnikaran ke sidhant ko mante he tathaa kuch sampoornataa ke sidhaant kaa samathan karte he
 The idea that all matter is made up of the early Kano is 6th century old, the theory of tradition and the study of the early Kano by ancient Greek scientists such as Lupicus, Democritus, ancient Indian scientists, Kanardha, Dignaga and Dharmakirti
 yah pracheen vichaar anubhavjanya avlokanon tathaa prayogon par aadhaarit na ho kar darshanik tark or saar ke aadhaar par banaaye gaye the In the 19th century May Dalton proved through his experiments that all matter is made up of the same particles, Dalton and his contemporaries believed that it was the fundamental particle of nature
 is liye unhone in kanon kaa naam ATOMS rakh diya jo ki ek greek shabd ATOMOS se prerit he jiskaa matlab hota he avibhajya
 haalanki 19 ve sadi ke ant tak vaigyaniko ko yah pataa chal chukaa tha ki ATOMS prakati ke mul kan nahin he apitu wo or bhi chote kanon kaa sanghathan maatr he
 The experiments of the early 20th century ended with the success of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, which led to an industry of converting one atom into another atom by which lead could be converted to gold, which is not possible
 in prayogon ke kaaran nabhakeey hathiyaaron ke vikaas ko bhi jor mila 1950 se 1960 ke bich bhinn bhinn prayogon main kai saare kanon ki khoj ki gai, jise kan chidyaghar ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he yah kan chidyaghar shabd 1970 main standard model banane ke baad khatm ho sakaa is standard model main kuch moolbhoot kanon ke dwaara lagbhag saare kanon ko paribhaashit kar diya gaya
 The present model of the classification of elementary particles is the standard model
 yah model madhyasthata gej boswanon kaa upyog kar majboot, kamjor or vidyut chumbakeey moulik baatcheet kaa varnan karata he
 The gauge boson that is native is gluons, W−, w + z bosons and photons
 The model consists of 24 types of fundamental particles, which are the main components of all types of matter
 haal hi main bahut samay tathaa bahut hi mahage prayogon ke baad iswariya kan higgs boson ke khoj ki ghoshnaa ki gai he
