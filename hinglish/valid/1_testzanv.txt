 agar koi nayaa yaa aparichit shabd ho to uske akshar pard kar pathak use uccharit kar saktaa he
 In hieroglyphs, readers sometimes read hundreds or thousands of symbols to learn
 chini bhashaa seekhney ke liye yah zaruri he
 Nevertheless, hieroglyphs have a major advantage
 nepali or hindi donon main aksharmala par aadhaarit devanagari lipi prayog hoti he
 If a Hindi speaker sees the word 'atuva' in Nepali language, he can pronounce it but cannot understand that it means 'ginger'
 iske vipareet chini or bhashaa main prayog hone vaale 猫 chihn ko dekhakar chinibhashi or japanibhashi donon 'billi' kaa arth praapt karte hai lekin isko apni-apni bhashaaon main bilkul bhinn prakaar se bolte hai
 In Japanese it is read 'neko' and in Mandarin Chinese it is read 'mao'
 japan ke bahut se log chini kaa bina ek bhi shabd jane chini akhbaar padhakar us se kaafii arth nikalne main sakasham hai
 If they read the same newspaper in Chinese, they do not understand anything
 yah usee tarah kii baat he jaise ☂ kaa chihn dekhakar hindibhashi 'chhatari' kahegaa, angrezibhaashi 'ambralla' kahegaa or francisibhaashi 'paraplui' kahegaa
 For this reason, Chinese-speaking people are often able to understand them to some extent by seeing thousands of years old inscriptions found in China, because many images have been going on for a long time with slight alterations
 haalanki chini lipi main bhavchitron kaa prayog hota he, phir bhi bahut se shabdon ko in bhavchitron se sambandhit dhvaniyon ko jodakar likhaa jaataa he
 Often in words, a graphic gives some sense of meaning and another is helpful in making sounds
 isliye chini lipi vastav main chitralipi or dhwani-aadhaarit lipi kaa ek mishrit rup he
 For example, in Chinese चीनी is pronounced 'chong' and it means 'strong current or wave of water'
 iske baayein main teen choti lakeeren hai jinka arth "pani" hota he
 It is also found in other words related to water, such as 河, 河 and 流
 chong ke baayein main to yah pani kaa bhavchitra he lekin uske daayen main 中 kaa chinh he jiskaa arth 'bich' he or jiskaa uccharan 'jong' kiya jaataa he
 When these two expressions are written together, पाठक is indicated to the reader that look for the sign on the left for the meaning and the right for the sound
 to pathak samaj jaataa he ki yah pani se sambandhit shabd he jiskaa uccharan 'jong' se miltaa-julata hoga
 With this, he realizes that the word is 'chong'
 gaur kijiye ki daayen taraf ke jong shabd kaa arth bilkul nahin prayog hota or baayein taraf ke pani se sambandhit shabd kii dhwani bilkul nahin prayog hoti
 Singh is a famous Indian surname

 islam dharm ke pramukh mat yah hai
 It is called Aqeedah: musalmaan ek hi ishwar ko maanate hai, jise wo allaah kehete hai
 Monotheism is called Tauheed in Arabic, which comes from the word vahid which means one
 islam main ishvar ko maanav kii samaj se upar samajha jaataa he
 Muslims have been asked to pray to God instead of imagining God
 musalamaanon ke anusaar ishvar adwitiya haih uske jaisaa or koi nahin
 a singular concept of God is emphasized in Islam
 saath main yah bhi mana jaataa ki uski puri kalpana manushya ke bas main nahin he
 Say: God is one more unique
 he ishwar sanathan, hameshaa se hameshaa tak jeene vaala
 He has no child, nor is he himself a child
 or us jaisaa koi or nahin
” According to Islam, from time to time, God made a person his messenger for the guidance of man on earth
 yah doot bhi manushya jati main se hote the or ishwar kii ore logon ko bulaate the
 God approached these messengers in various ways
 in ko islam main nabi kehete hai
 The prophets to whom Ishwar himself provided scripture or religion books are called Rasul
 mohammad sahib bhi isi kadi kaa hissaa the
 The name of the religious book that was given to him is Quran
 quran main ishwar ke 25 anya nabiyon kaa varnan he
 According to the Quran itself, God has sent many more prophets to the earth besides these prophets, which are not mentioned in the Quran
 sabhi musalmaan ishwar dwaara bheje gayi sabhi nabiyon kii vaidhata sweenkar karte hai or adhiktam musalmaan mohammad sahab ko ishwar kaa antim nabi maanate hai
 The people of the Ahmadiyya community do not consider Muhammad Sahab as the last prophet and also call themselves a follower of Islam
 bharat ke ucchtam nyaayalay ke anusaar unako bharat main musalmaan mana jaataa he
 Many other eminent Muslim scholars have raised questions about Muhammad Sahab's last prophet from time to time
 musalamaanon ke liye ishwar dwaara rasulon ko pradaan kii gayi sabhi dharmik pustaken vaid hai
 According to Muslims, the Quran is the last religious book provided by God to man
 quran main chaar or pustakon kii charchaa he: Muslims understand that Christians and Jews have changed the context of their books
 vah in chaaron ke alaava anya dharmik pusatakon kii hone kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin karte hai
 Muslims believe in the existence of angels
 unke anusaar farishte swayan koi ichhashkti nahin rakhte or keval ishwar kii ajna kaa paalan hi karte hai
 They are abstract and innocent celebrities made of pure light, which are neither men nor women but different from humans in every respect
 haalanki agananeey farishte he par chaar farishte quran main prabhaav rakhte hai: Like other religions in Central Asia, Islam is also considered a day of doom
 iske anusaar ishwar ek din sansar ko samaapt karegaa
 Only God is aware of when this day will come
 ise musalmaan qayaamat kaa din kehete hai
 In Islam, there is a lot of emphasis on the resurrection of all physically dead people on that day
 us din har insaan ko uske achche or bure karmon kaa fal diya jayega
 Islam does not have the concept of time circularity like Hinduism
 qayaamat ke din ke baad dobaaraa sansar kii rachana nahin hogi
 Muslims believe in fate
 taqadir kaa matlab inke liye yah he ki ishwar beete hue samay, vartmaan or bhavishya ke bare main sab jaanata he
 Nothing can happen without his permission
 manushya ko apni man marazi se jeene kii azaadi to he par isaki anumati bhi ishwar hi ke dwaara use di gayi he
 According to Islam, man himself is responsible for his misdeeds because God allows man to take them for himself or not
 uske kukarmon kaa bhi purv gyaan ishwar ko hota he

 Geology is divided into two major classes: bhautik bhuvigyaan ke antargat khanij vigyaan, mrudaa vigyaan, sanrachanaatmak bhuvigyaan or bhuakritik vigyaan sammilit hai
 Historical geology incorporates layered rockology, paleontology and geography
 aajkal bhuvigyaan ko nimnlikhit do shakhaon main vibhakt karte hai- The study of geomorphic changes is also often called dynamic geology
 spasht he ki yah naam prishthiya vaataavaran kii gatisheel sthiti kii ore sanket karata hai, kintu aajkal yah naam kuch vishesh prachlit nahin he or iske sthaan par bhautik bhuvigyaan adhik prachlit he
 There are three main parts of this science, which are as follows: bhautikee · jeev vigyaan · rasayan vigyaan · jaevrasiniki · ganit · jaev praudyogiki · jyotish · sookshmjaiviki Cauliflower is a popular vegetable

 Medium and late growing varieties - cow dung manure / compost - 250 quintals, nitrogen 125 kg, Sphur - 75 kg and potash - 40 kg per hectare are required
 gobar kii khaad yaa compost khet taiyaar karte samay phosphorus tathaa potash paudh ropan ke pehle tathaa nitrogen do bhaagon main krimash: ropai ke 10-15 din tathaa 25-30 din baad dena chahie
 Dung manure, sphur and potash should be given in the spraying method and nitrogen should be given in standing crop with fertilizer or top dressing method
 sphur, potash tathaa nitrogen kisi bhi sanyukt yaa swatanntra urvarak ke rup main diye ja sakate he
 Normally one hectare cauliflower crop takes 50 kg of nitrogen, 18 kg of phosphorus and 50 kg of potash in the land at one time

 rajya us sangathit ikai ko kehete hai jo ek shashan ke adheen ho
 States can be sovereign
 iske alaava kisi shaskeey ikai yaa uske kisi prabhag ko bhi 'rajya' kehete hai, jaise bharat ke pradeshon ko bhi 'rajya' kehete hai
 The state is the essential truth of the modern world
 duniya ke adhikansh log kisi-na-kisi rajya ke naagarik hai
 For those who are not citizens of any state, it is very difficult to preserve their existence in the current world order
 vastav main, 'rajya' shabd kaa upyog teen alag-alag tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he
 First, it can be considered a historical entity; Second, it can be seen as a philosophical idea ie a permanent form of human society; And third, it can be seen as a modern phenomenon
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki in sabhi arthon kaa ek-duusare se takaraav hi ho
 Actually, the difference between these needs to be carefully understood
 vaicharik str par rajya ko marxvad, nariwad or araajaktaavaad aadi se chunauti mili he
 But no other strong unit has been discovered beyond the state
 rajya abhi bhi praasangik he or dinon-din majboot hota ja rahaa he
 In European thought, the four parts of the state are described as - nishchit bhubhag, jansankhya, sarkaar or samprabhutaa
 In Indian political thought, seven parts of the state are counted as- raja yaa swami, mantri yaa amaatya, suhrid, desh, kosh, durg or sena
 Kautilya has stated the seven parts of the state and this is called his "weekend Principle" - raja, amatya yaa mantri, poor yaa durg, kosh, dand, mitra 
 Many political philosophers believe that the use of the state in the modern sense can be seen first in the writings of Niccol मैक Machiavelli
 1532 main prakashit apni vikhyath rachana da prince main unhone 'stato' shabd kaa prayog bhu-kshetreey samprabhu sarkaar kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya
 Another of Machiavelli's work 'the Discourses' has a different theme, but it has the same basic ideological basis as The Prince
 maikiyaveli ke anusaar rajshahi main keval prince hi swadhin he, par ganraajya main har vyakti prince he
 He has the right to adopt the same skills to protect his safety, liberty and property
 maikiyaveli ke anusaar ganraajya main prince jaisi kuubiyon ko samuhik rup se viksit karne kii zarurat he, or ye kuubiyaan mitrataa or paroapkaar jaise parmparik sadgunon ke aadhaar par nahin viksit ho saktin
 Every person in the republic will collaborate with others on an open platform with the aim of acquiring the name and name
 maikiyaveli maanate the ki rajshahi ke mukaable ganraajya adhik dakshata se kaam kar sakegaa, usamen pratiraksha kii adhik kshamta hogi or vah yuddh ke dwaara apni simaaon kaa adhik kushalta se vistaar kar sakegaa
 According to Machiavelli, in the process of doing all this, powerful, indomitable and self-dependent people will be created
 aise ganraajyon ko nirankushta main badalane se kaise roka ja sakegaa? maikiyaveli iske liye do sharten pesh karte hai : har ganraajya ko tike rahane ke liye aisa prabandh karnaa hoga jisamen har vyakti duusare ke saath srujanaatmak dhang se hode kar sake, kisi ek vyakti ko itani shakti arjeet karne se rokna hoga ki vah dusron par prabhutv jamaa sake
 There will be conflicts between the elite and the nobility or business lords and the general public for dominance, from whose womb the Republic will get new energy and good laws will be born, provided that those struggles can be controlled by better political institutions
 kanoon aise hone chahie jinaki jaankaree logon ke saamne saafe kar sake ki ganraajya main ve kya-kya bekhatke kar sakate hai, or kya karne par unhen dand bhogana hoga
 Economic prosperity should be allowed, but there should be a legal prohibition on acquiring excessive wealth at the personal level
 naagarik gunon ke vikaas ke liye rajya kaa ek dharm hona chahie, par maikiyaveli isai dharm ko yah haisiyat dene ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 Machiavelli, based on his experience of immunizing Florence, had concluded that there should be an army of civilians to protect the Republic from invasions
 quentin skinner maanate hai ki maikiyaveli ne jab rajya kii charchaa kii to ve ek prince ke rajya kii baat kar rahe the
 He was not impersonal in the sense in which it is used today
 europee aadhuniktaa ke shuruaati daur main carch or raja donon ke paas hi raajnneetik shakti hoti thi or donon ke paas apni-apni senaayen bhi hoti thim
 There was also a possibility of war between the church and the king
 1648 main tees varshiya yuddh ke baad westefelia kii sandhi hui
 This reduced the power of the church and gave the king authority over his own territory
 isane antarashtriya str par samprabhu rajyon ke astitv ko sweekaar kiya
 The philosophical level of credit for establishing the imperative of the state for society goes to seventeenth-century thinker Thomas Hobbes and his work Leviathan
 is pustak ke pehle sanskaran ke aavaran par ek daityakaar mukutadhaari vyakti kaa chitra ukera gaya tha jisaki akruti choti-choti maanviya ungliyon se bani thi
 This giant had a sword in one hand, and a scepter in the other
 darasal, hobbs is bhautikwaadi or anandavaadi vichaar ke pratipadak the ki manushya kaa uddeshy adhiktam anand or kam se kam pidaa bhogana he
 If a man can find happiness in the enjoyment of another, according to Hobbes, he is also capable of philanthropy
 lekin, agar sansaadhan kam hue yaa kisi kism kaa bhay hua, to manushya aatmakendrit or taatkaalik agrahon ke adheen ho kar paroapkaar ko multavee kar degaa
 In such a situation, he needs the control of some government over himself, otherwise he will reach a natural state inferior to civilization and culture, making a free effort to maximize his happiness and minimize misery
 jo kuch uske paas he, use khone ke dar se manushya shakti ke ek mukaam se duusare mukaam tak pahunchne kii koshishon main laga rahegaa jiskaa ant keval uski mrityu se hi ho sakegaa
 If the strong state did not restrain its efforts, mankind would reach a natural state where each person would be engaged in mutually destructive activities as the enemy of another
 manushya ko niyantrit karne vaala yahi param shaktishaalee or sarvyaapee rajya hobbs ke shabdon main levaythan he
 Hobbes had no doubt that if this giant figure Leviathan would not govern man, he could not arrive at a rational decision to achieve peace and order
 us surat main manushya ek-duusare ko haani na pahunchaane ke paraspar anubandh par bhi nahin pahunch paayegaa
 This series of arguments shows Hobbes that man creates a society under a social agreement in which everyone wants to pursue his own interest and therefore makes a pact with others that he will not hurt another's interest provided that his interest in return Do not be hurt
 hobbs kaa vichaar tha ki is samjhaute kaa ulanghan na ho, isliye ek samprabhu satta kii zarurat padegi taaki saarvajanik shanti or suraksha kii guarantee kii ja sake
 This sovereign will not exert his power only for fear of power
 hobbs ne levaythan ke duusare adhyay ‘of da kaamanwealth’ main kai tarah ke sambhav sanvaidhanik roopon kii charchaa kii he
 But, in theory, Hobbes appears in favor of undivided power
 iske liye unhen rajshahinuma satta kii vakaalat karne main bhi koi harj nahin lagata
 In the eyes of Hobbes, this sovereign will not be autocratic, because he must also give freedom to his subjects to an extent in order to ensure the conditions to sustain himself
 bhautik jinson or samruddhi kaa vitaran is tarah sunishchit karnaa hoga jisase us takaraav ke andeshe hameshaa thande hote rahen jo paraspar len-dein kii prakriya se aksar paidaa hota rahata he
 Hobbes thought religion was a private matter, but its public aspects should be left entirely to the head of state
 rajya kaa mukhiya hi carch kaa mukhiya hona chahie
 In cases where the Bible does not give clear instructions, the instructions of the head of state should be considered final
 apane inhen vichaaron ke kaaran hobbs ne catholic carch ko andhkaar ke samrajya kii sangya di, kyonki vah apane anuyaayiyon se rajya ke prati vafadaari se bhi pare jane vaali vafadaariyon kii maang karata he
 He raised his voice against purists who appealed to stand against the state on the basis of conscience
 hobbs kaa matlab saafe tha ki agar shanti-vyavastha ke saath rahanaa he to rajkeey praadhikaar ke ulanghan se baaj aana hoga
 It is not necessary that a person is a symbol of sovereignty of the state
 vah kisi sabha or kisi sansad kii samprabhutaa bhi ho sakati he
 In this sense, Hobbes' theory also has scope for parliamentary sovereignty
 hobbs dwaara pesh kiye gayi rajya sambandhi siddhant ne baad ke europee chintakon ko prabhavit karnaa jari rakhaa
 In the process, a common understanding emerged, according to which a set of state political institutions was considered to establish its dominance in the name of Mushtaraka interests in a fixed demarcated territory
 yah paribhaasha maiks webar kii us vyakhya se bahut prabhavit he jo unhone apni rachana ‘di profeshan and vocation of politics’ main pesh kii thi
 In it, Weber described three aspects of the modern state: its geo-territoriality, its right to violence, and its legitimacy
 webar kaa tark tha ki agar kisi sunishchit bhu-bhaag main rahane vaale samaaj main koi sanstha hinsa kaa dar dikhaa kar logon se kinhin niyam-kanoonon kaa paalan nahin karaayegi to araajaktaa fail jaaegi
 Weber has also tried to answer the question, why do people believe in the state? Only on the strength of violence? Or is there any logic of obedience? Weber's answer is that in addition to showing fear of violence, the state also exercises its legitimacy to legitimize its dominance so as to prove non-violent justification of obedience

 In the primitive era, after being exhausted from work all day, everyone used to sit in an open circle for entertainment and in the middle of that circle, their food would be cooking, eating and dancing and the same would later be dancing and singing

 Problems related to general public and their solution are popular topics of street plays

 Initially, scholars of literature and plays were hesitant to accept street plays as classical theatrical genre
 ise lok-natya kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya lekin pichley teen dashakon ke dauraan nukkad naatak kaaphi lokapriy hote chale gaye or kai namchin naatakkaar or rangakarmi isse jud gaye

 a user searching for an order must have a continuous search strategy
 The more search strategies there are, the more frustrating the search will be for the user
 The more continuous grouping, the easier the search
 doosraa, "kam se kam vismay kaa siddhant" mahatvapurn he
 Different facilities should work in the same way
 For example, Adobe Acrobat has some features "select Tools then select the text object to which to apply
" The others are "select text object, then apply action to selected
" 
 In all contexts, commands should work in the same way
 teesraa, yuzar interfes ke prati nirantarata salaah sanskaran-prati-sanskaran parivartit hoti he
 Change must be minimal and further compatibility must be maintained
 For example, the redesign from the menu bar in Microsoft Office 2003 to the Ribbon Toolbar in Microsoft Office 2007 received mixed responses aimed at making the most used functions accessible
 kaha gaya ki isse "gussa or kuntha" utpann hue or "samay, prashikshan or laagat main pramukh prayaas" lage
 bijli upyogkartaaon ne kaha ki nae interfes ko "seekhney ke liye bahut samay or dhairya lagata he
 "an online survey by the Excel Users Group reported that about 80% of respondents had a negative opinion of the change and that this 80% self-perceived decrease in productivity was" around 35% "
 yuzar interfes dizine main nirantarata sakal nahin balki ek gun he lekin sabase mahatvapurn main se ek he
 In some cases, breach of continuity principles may provide sufficient evidentiary benefit and an intelligent and careful user interface designer may violate continuity to achieve some other important goal
 aam taur par, kam paripakv software ke kam yuzar hote hai jo yathapurv sthiti main hi duube hai
 Older and more widely used software should avoid the situation more carefully to avoid disruptive costs
 The most experienced users and those who get the most from a program are the users who bear the greatest expense on converting
 haalanki, aise aadan-pradaan main nirantarata sabase mahatvapurn mul siddhanton main se ek he or iskaa yah kam se kam ulanghan kiya janaa chahie
 bekaar yuzar interfes dizine or ek maujuuda yuzar interfes par kharaab tarah se lagu parivartan kii laagat upyogkartaaon par baari pad sakati hai
 Different ways in which users can use a product hai yuai dizine main unka varnan karne ke liye do shabdon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Modalization refers to multiple alternative interfaces of the same product while the methodology describes different positions of the same interface
 input or output le jane ke liye yuzar interfes dwaara lagu sampreshan kaa path rupatmakataa he
 Examples of modalities are: upyogkarta ko anyonyakriya ke liye chayan kii anumati dete hue yuzar interfes kai anaavashyak input or output rupatmakataa ko lagu kar saktaa he
 a mode is a different mode of operation in a computer program in which the same input may produce different perceived results depending on the state of the computer program
 udhaaharan ke liye, caps lox aise input mod ko shuru kar detaa he jisamen tip kiye hue akshar difolt se aprkes main honge or caps loxmod main na hone par usee typing se akshar loarkes main honge
 paddati kaa baari upyog aksar yuzar interfes kii prayojyata ko kam kar detaa he kyonki upyogkarta ko vartmaan mod sthiti or yathaaavashyak mod sthiti ke bich badlaav karnaa yaad rakhane kaa prayaas karnaa padataa he
 The Chakraval method is a cyclic method of solving non-square squares equations
 iske dwaara pel ke sameekaran kaa bhi hal nikal jaataa he
 The credit for its invention is often given to Bhaskar II, but some people give credit to Jaidev as well
 is vidhi kaa naam 'chakravaal' ) isliye padaa he kyonki isamen kuttak se gun labdhi ke baad punah vargprakruti or punah kuttak kiya jaataa he
 Brahmagupta in 628 AD x or y ke sabase chote purnankon ke liye iskaa hal nikaala tha
 They could solve this for only a few values of N, not for all
 jayadev or bhaskar ne chakravaal vidhi kaa upyog karte hue is sameekaran kaa sabase pehle hal prastut kiya tha
 He has given the solution of the following equation- unke dwaara nimnlikhit hal diya gaya he- This problem is a very difficult problem because the values of x and y are very large
 isaki kathinaayee kaa anumaan isse hi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki europe main iskaa hal wiliam brounkar ne 1657-58 main jaakar nikaala tha
 In his book entitled Algebra, Bhaskaracharya has described the Chakravala method as follows- mirza gaalib 1954 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 This film made on the biography of the famous poet Mirza Ghalib of Hindustan was well appreciated
 is film ke sangeetkaar gulam mohammad hai
 a macrocycle is, as defined by IUPAC, "a cyclic macromolecule or a molecule of a macromolecular cyclic part
" In chemical literature, macrocycles varyingly include molecules containing 8 or more atoms of rings, or 12 or more atoms
 Well-known examples are the drugs known as macrolides
 The IUPAC definition notes that a "cyclic macromolecule has no end-groups but can still be considered as a chain," and that "macrocycle is sometimes used for low relative molecular molecules
" Molecules that are not considered mass
 Many macrocycles are employed as macrocyclic ligands
 ek macrocycle upsarg cyclo- ke saath shuruyaat ke naam par he, varishthata kii sthapana kii ek aadesh se chakra main sabase varisht ikai kaa hawala dete hue, kramik rup se agle varishthata main kam nikatatam ikai kii disha main kram main shesh ikaayiyon kaa hawala dete hue dwaara peechha kiya
 Bridges are also cited sequentially, while substituents are quoted from substitutional principles
 synthetic 1960 ke liye pehle kiya macrocycles, udhaaharan ke Linstead, Elvidge or sah kaaryakartaaon ke liye kuch bikhare hue reporton 1950 ke dashak main mecrosaiclic yogicon ke vibhinn prakaar ke sanshleshan kii soochna di jinamein se kuch sambhavit trikoniya or tetra- dantedaar porphyrins or phthalocyanines ke samaan ligands rahe hai
 They were reported in the 1960s to form complexes with metals such as copper, nickel, cobalt, etc
 Curtis described in New Zealand the reaction between trisethylenediaminenickel perchlorate and acetone resulting in a macrocyclic product
 saamaanya main, macrocycles se sanshleshit kar rahe hai chote, aamtaur par raikhik, anuon
 There are two major categories for synthesizing macrocycles, the priority being in both to choose the product required for maximum yields, which inhibit competing strategies of linear polymerization and other reactions
 is cyclization aay ek paaramparik jaivik pratikriya kii jarurat nahin he, kisi bhi tarah kii dishaatmak prabhaav kii ek dhaatu aayan
 Typically involves a 1: 1 condensation reaction to produce reagents of equimolar concentrations, either in high dilution conditions or medium to low dilution conditions
 kuch cyclizations madad kar rahe hai ki upasthiti se dhaatu yanon, jo madad karata he ko vyavasthit gathan ke macrocyclic ligand
 dhaatu aayan ke rup main kaary karata ek 'template' ke liye cyclization pratikriya he
 Phthalocyanine was the first synthetic template produced by macrocycle reaction
 dhaatu aayan pratyaksh kar sakate sankshepan preferentially karne ke liye chakree bajaay polymeric utpaada yaa sthir macrocycle ek baar kaa gathan 
 The shape of the cation used as a template has proved to be of importance in synthetic route guidance for Schiff base systems
 templating keshan kii trigya or macrocycle kii "chhed " ke bich anukulata synthetic maarg kii prabhaavashiltaa ke liye or jiske parinamswaroop parisar kii jyamiti ke liye yogadan
 The macrocyclic effect reflects enhanced kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities of a macrocyclic ligand compared to its open chain analog
 yah chelate challe kii sankhya main vruddhi ke saath ucch sthirataa ko dikhaane ke liye ek jatil ke liye ummid kii gai thi, lekin mecrosaiclic ligands kii sthirataa main sudhaar pariman main bahut adhik se adhik ek atirikt chelate anguthi ke ekmaatr upasthiti se adhik kii ummid thi
 This additional and unexpected stability led to the coining of the term macrocyclic effect by Cabbiness and Margerum in 1970
 adhyayan vibhinn thermodynamic or gatij maapdandon ke is prabhaav main jiske parinamswaroop shaamil hone kaa pataa chalata he
 Porphyrins are a group of heterocyclic macrocyclic compounds composed of four pyrrole subunits, all mutually described on α carbon via a methine bridge
 ve prakruti ke bheetar apni vistrut vitaran kii vajah se madhya 20 veen sadi ke baad se pramukh anusandhan kaa vishay rahaa he
 They usually exist in the form of metal complexes such as either heme iron or magnesium compounds
 ve is tarah ke myoglobins, catalases, chlorophylls, or cytochromes ke rup main praathmik chayapachayon kaa ek vishaal raashi main kritrim samooh, ke rup main seva karte hai
 Due to these characteristics, these compounds have many applications within chemistry, biology and medicine
 Corrin ek heterocyclic yogic ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he or vyutpann vitamin bi 12 ke bheetar paaya karne ke liye mata-pita macrocycle ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Thus, it is seen as a center ring within this essential complex
 deprotonation ke madhyam se, is anguthi sanrachana cobalt ke saath band or vitamin bi 12 kii buniyadi sanrachana ke gathan ko banane ke liye sakasham he
 Vitamin B12 has an important role in the functioning of the brain and nervous system
 kshetra ke bheetar byaaj kii jald se jald binduon main se ek ke rup main, macrocycles ke aayan parivahan mukhya rup se mukut ethers or cryptands aasapaas gumti he
 Recent efforts are being made to provide switches to facilitate control of some cation transport rates
 switch ke prakaar he ki viksit kiya gaya he ke do praathmik udhaaharan tasviir cryptands kaa upyog switch, or vidyut switch Anthraquinone vyutpann kamand ether kaa upyog kar rahe hai
 These transport efforts have broadly focused on the involvement of metal cations, and more recently with the development focused on the use of macrocycles for the transport of nucleoside compounds such as
 katelicys ke bheetar aavedan substrate or utprerak pratikriya ke aadhaar par kai kshetron main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 An initial attempt at catalysis was made with small molecule activation, cobalt and nickel macrocycles such as oxygen as well as carbon dioxide with a number of transition metal ion macrocycle
 ek baar jab substrates kii manyata dhaatu aayan ke alaava anya praapt kiya ja saktaa he, nae katelicys aavedan patr banaaya ja saktaa he
 Macrocycles are not just larger versions of small molecules, but are thought to be the smallest examples of biomolecules performing functional sub-domains
 Macrocycles atyadhik shaktishaalee he or saath hi chaynaatmak hona paaya jaataa he
 They are flexible to mold to a target surface and maximize binding interactions
