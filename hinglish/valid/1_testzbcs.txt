1903 main 16 varsh kii aayu main hi unka vivaah dur ke rishte kii bahan 'sivaakamu' ke saath sampann ho gaya
 At that time his wife was only 10 years old
 atah teen varsh baad hi unki patni ne unke saath rahanaa armbh kiya
 Although his wife Sivakamu was not traditionally educated, he had good authority over the Telugu language
 vah angrezi bhashaa bhi likh-pard sakati thim
 In 1908, the Radhakrishnan couple received a daughter as a child
 1908 main hi unhone kala snaatak kii oopaadhi pratham shrenee main praapt kii or darshan shaastra main vishisht yogyata praapt kii
 In 1909, after six years of marriage, he also passed the postgraduate examination in Arts
 inkaa vishay darshan shaastra hi rahaa
 He also continued to teach tuition to children for his personal income during higher studies
 1908 main unhone em0 e0 kii oopaadhi praapt karne ke liye ek shodh lekh bhi likhaa
 At this time, he was only twenty years old
 isse shastron ke prati unki gyaan-pipaasa badi
 Soon he also studied Vedas and Upanishads deeply
 iske atirikt unhone hindi or sanskrit bhashaa kaa bhi ruchipurvak adhyayan kiya
 While education definitely has an impact on every individual, the quality of an educational institution also leaves an impact
 chrishchiyan sansthaaon dwaara us samay pashchimi jivan mulyon ko vidhyaarthiyon ke bheetar kaaphi gaharaai tak sthapit kiya jaataa tha
 This is the reason that while studying in Christian institutions, Radhakrishnan's life had high qualities
 lekin unamem ek anya parivartan bhi aayaa jo ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon ke kaaran hi tha
 Some people used to view Hindutva ideas and criticize them
 unki aalochana ko dow radhakrishnan ne chunauti kii tarah liya or hindu shastron kaa gaharaa adhyayan karnaa armbh kar diya
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan wanted to know that in which culture ideas really are conscious and in which culture ideas are rooted? Then by natural intuition started to believe strongly that the poor and illiterate people living in remote places of India also knew the ancient truth
 is kaaran radhakrishnan ne tulanaatmak rup se yah jaan liya ki bhartiya aadhyatm kaafii samrudh he or chrishchiyan mishnariyon dwaara hindutv kii aalochanaayen niraadhaar hai
 From this he concluded that Indian culture is based on religion, knowledge and truth which gives the true message of life to the creature
 dow radhakrishnan ne yah bhalee bhanti jaan liya tha ki jivan bahut hi chota he parantu isamen vyaapt khushiyaan anishchit hai
 For this reason, a person should live happily and comfortably
 vastutah mrityu ek atal sachai he, jo amir garib sabhi ko apana grass banaati he tathaa kisi prakaar kaa varg bhed nahin karti
 True knowledge is the only one who can eliminate the ignorance inside you
 sadgipurn santoshavritti kaa jivan amiron ke ahamkaari jivan se behatar he, jinamein asantosh kaa nivas he
 a quiet mind is better than those thunderous applause; Which are heard in parliaments and courts
 vastut: isi kaaran dow radhakrishnan bhartiya samskruti ke naitik mulyon ko samaj paane main safal rahe, kyonki ve mishnariyon dwaara kii gai aalochanaon ke satya ko swayan parakhnaa chaahate the
 That is why criticisms are said to be acts of purification
 sabhi matayen apane bacchon main ucch sanskaar dekhnaa chaahati hai
 For this reason, they teach children how to believe in God, stay away from sin and help those who are in trouble
 dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah bhi janaa ki bhartiya samskruti main sabhi dharmon kaa aadar karnaa sikhaaya gaya he or sabhi dharmon ke liye samta kaa bhav bhi hindu samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan he
 Thus he understood the specific identity of Indian culture and became very close to it
 dow radhakrishnan samooche vishwa ko ek vidhyalay maanate the
 He believed that only through education can the human mind be properly utilized
 at: vishwa ko ek hi ikai maanakar shiksha kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 In his speech at the University of Edinburgh, UK, Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had said - "man should be one
 maanav itihaas kaa sampurna lakshya maanav jati kii mukti tabhi sambhav he jab deshon kii nitiyon kaa aadhaar puure vishwa main shaanti kii sthapana kaa praytn ho
 "dr
 Radhakrishnan used to enchant the students with his wit-filled explanations, joyful expressions and mildly tickling stories
 ucch naitik mulyon ko apane aacharan main utaarne kii prerana vah apane chaatro ko bhi dete the
 Whatever subject he taught, he himself studied it deeply
 darshan jaise gambheer vishay ko bhi vah apni style se saral, rochak or priy bana dete the
 In 1909, at the age of 21, Dr
 Radhakrishnan started teaching philosophy as a junior lecturer in Madras Presidency College
 yah unka param saubhaahgya tha ki unako apni prakruti ke anukool aajeevika praapt hui thi
 Here he not only did teaching work for 7 years but also studied Indian philosophy and Indian religion deeply
 un dinon vyaakhyaata ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki adhyaapan hetu vah shikshan kaa prashikshan bhi praapt kare
 That is why in 1910 Radhakrishnan started taking training in Madras
 is samay inkaa vetan maatr 37 rupee tha
 Radhakrishnan, the then Professor of Philosophy Department, was greatly overwhelmed by the philosophy of classical knowledge
 unhone unhen darshan shaastra kii kakshaon se anupasthit rahane kii anumati pradaan kar di
 But instead, it was conditioned that he should teach in philosophy classes instead
 tab radhakrishna ne apane kaksha saathiyon ko teraa aise prabhaavshaalee vyaakhyaan diye, jinase ve shikshaarthi bhi chakit rah gayi
 The reason for this was that he had a deep grip on the subject, his approach to philosophy was clear and he had also chosen the appropriate words while giving lectures
 1912 main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan kii "manovigyaan ke aavashyak tatv" sheershak se ek laghu pustika bhi prakashit hui jo kaksha main diye gayi unke vyakhyanon kaa sangrah tha
 This qualification was proved by this booklet that "not only do they have a rich store of words to explain every verse, their memory power is also very unique
 " When Dr
 Radhakrishnan returned to India from Europe and America, then various universities here honored him by awarding him honorary degrees
 1928 kii sheet ritu main inaki pratham mulaaqaat pandit jawahar laal nehru se us samay hui, jab vah congress party ke vaarshik adhiveshan main sammilit hone ke liye kalakatta aae hue the
 Although Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan could not participate in any political discourse as a member of the Indian Educational Service, he did not care for this taboo and gave a speech
 1929 main inhen vyaakhyaan dene hetu 'maanchester vishvavidhyalay' dwaara aamantrit kiya gaya
 He gave many lectures in Manchester and London
 inaki shiksha sambandhi uplabdhiyon ke daayre main nimnavat sansthanik seva kaaryon ko dekha jaataa he- Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan did the same and put his address to rest at 12 o'clock at night
 pandit nehru or radhakrishnan ke alaava kisi anya ko isaki jaankaree nahin thi
 After independence, he was requested to fulfill diplomatic work with the Soviet Union as a distinguished ambassador to serve the motherland
 is prakaar vijayalakshmi pandit kaa inhen nayaa uttaradhikari chunaa gaya
 Pandit Nehru's selection prompted many to wonder why a philosopher was chosen for diplomatic services? He suspected that the abilities of Dr
 Radhakrishnan were not compatible with the responsibility assigned to him
 lekin baad main sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah sabit kar diya ki moscow main niyukt bhartiya rajanyikon main ve sabase behatar the
 He was a non-traditional diplomat
 jo mantranaayen der raatri hoti thim, ve unamem raatri 10 baje tak hi bhaag lete the, kyonki uske baad unke shayan kaa samay ho jaataa tha
 Even when Radhakrishnan was a teacher, he was not bound by rules
 kaksha main yah 20 minute deree se aate the or das minute purv hi chale jate the
 They said that the lectures they had to give in class were completed in enough time of 20 minutes
 iske uparant bhi yah vidhyaarthiyon ke priy evam aadarneey shikshak bane rahe
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was elected Vice President after his arrival from the Soviet Union in 1952
 samvidhan ke antargat uparashtrapati kaa nayaa pad srujit kiya gaya tha
 Nehru again surprised the people by choosing Radhakrishnan for this post
 unhen aashcharya tha ki is pad ke liye congress party ke kisi raajnneetijna kaa chunaav kyon nahin kiya gaya
 Radhakrishnan also served as the Speaker in the Rajya Sabha as Vice President
 san 1952 main ve bharat ke uparashtrapati banaaye gayi
 Later this selection of Pandit Nehru also proved to be meaningful, because a non-politician as Vice President influenced all politicians
 sansad ke sabhi sadasyon ne unhen unke kaary vyavhaar ke liye kaafii saraahaa
 People still remember his generosity, perseverance and humorous nature
 hamaare desh ke dwitiya kintu adwitiya raashtrapati dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ke janm din ko prativarsh 'shikshak diwas' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 On this day, awards are also given to the best teachers in the entire country by the Government of India
 yadhyapi unhen 1931 main british samrajya dwaara "sar" kii oopaadhi pradaan kii gayi thi lekin swatantrata prapti ke pashchaat uskaa auchity dow radhakrishnan ke liye samaapt ho chukaa tha
 When he became the Vice President, the first President of independent India, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad ji gave him the country's highest decoration Bharat Ratna in 1954 for his great philosophical and educational achievements

 yah prakriya stryptococal bacteria ke kaaran gale ke sankraman se shuru hoti he
 If it is not treated, this throat infection turns into rheumatic fever
 baar-baar ke rumetic bukhaar se hi rumetic hriday rog viksit hota he
 Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that affects the body, especially the tissues connecting the heart, joints, brain, or skin
 jab rumetic bukhaar hriday ko sthaayee rup se kshatigrast karata he, to us avasthaa ko rumetic hriday rog kaha jaataa he
 People of all ages can suffer from severe rheumatic fever, but it usually occurs in children between five and 15 years of age
 hriday kaa ek kshatigrast valve yaa to puri tarah band nahin hota yaa puri tarah nahin khulata he
 The first condition is medically called insufficiency and the second is stenosis
 puri tarah band nahin honevaale hriday ke valve main khun, hriday ke usee kaksh main waapas chalaa jaataa he, jahaan se use pump kiya jaataa he
 This is called regurgitation or leakage
 hriday kii agali dhadkan ke saath yah khun valve se paar hokar saamanyaroop se bahanevaale khun main mil jaataa he
 This extra amount of blood passing through the heart puts an extra burden on the heart muscle
 jab hriday kaa valve puri tarah nahin khulata he, tab hriday ko khun kii saamaanya se adhik maatra pump kerani padati he, taaki sankare raste main paryaapt khun sharir main jaye
 Generally, no symptoms are seen until the path becomes very narrow
 chaati ke eks re or isiji do aisi saamaanya jaanch hai, jinase pataa chalata he ki hriday prabhavit hua he yaa nahin
 Physicians prescribe its treatment based on the patient's general health, medical history, and severity of illness
 chunki rumetic bukhaar hriday rog kaa kaaran he, isliye iskaa sarvottam upachaar rumetic bukhaar ke baar-baar hone se rokna he
 The best way to prevent rheumatic heart disease is to prevent rheumatic fever
 gale ke sankraman ke tatkaal or samuchit upachaar se is rog ko roka ja saktaa he
 If there is rheumatic fever, its repeated invasion can be prevented by continuous antibiotic treatment
 ad-dahana arabi registan kaa madhya hissaa he

 If Indian languages are said to have originated in the southeastern part of the indo-european family, it would be appropriate for the Nordic or Scandinavian languages to say that they came from the opposite part, ie the northwest
 nordic bhashaayen german bhashasamudaay se sambandhit hai or tadnusaar german umalaut in bhashaaon main bhi paae jate hai
 In the first century the Nordic languages separated and formed their new community

 This language was similar to the Old German language at that time, but it changed a lot after the sixth century and it was partly West German and to a lesser extent East German - in which the language of literature written in the fourth century Gothic is the predominant language - separated from the language community

 Pluto was once considered the outermost planet in the solar system, but is now considered the largest celestial object in the outer circle of the solar system
 kyper ghere kii anya vastuon kii tarah pluto kaa akar or dravyaman kaafii chota he - iskaa aakaar prithvi ke chandramaa se sirf ek-tihaai he
 Its orbit around the sun is also a little clumsy - it is sometimes 30 astronomical units away from the sun by going inside Varuna's orbit and sometimes reaching 45 khz away from the sun
 pluto kyper ghere kii anya vastuon kii tarah adhiktar jami hui nitrogen kii barf, pani kii barf or pathar kaa bana hua he
 It takes 248
09 years for Pluto to make a full orbit of the sun
 pluto kaa vyas lagbhag 2,300 kimi he, yani prithvi kaa 18%
 Its color is a mixture of black, orange and white
 kaha jaataa he ke jitna antar pluto ke rangon ke bich main he itnaa saura mandal kii bahut kam vastuon main dekha jaataa he, yani unpar rang adhiktar ek-jaise hi hote hai
 Studies from 1994 to 2003 showed that the colors of Pluto have changed
 uttari dhruv kaa rang thodaa ujala ho gaya tha or dakshini dhruv thodaa gadha
 It is believed to be a sign of changing seasons on Pluto
 pluto kaa bahut patala vayumandal he jisamen nitrogen, methane or carbon monooxid he
 When Pluto turns away from the sun, orbiting it, the cold rises on it, and some of these gases freeze and fall on its surface, making his atmosphere even more diluted
 jab pluto suraj ke paas aata he tab uski sataha par padi isi barf kaa kuch bhaag gas banakar vayumandal main aa jaataa he
 Pluto has five known satellites - the Sharon discovered in 1978, which is the largest and has half the diameter of Yama, the two little moons discovered in 2005, Nix and Hydra, Stix, and the Kerberos, announced on 20 July 2011 30 km in size Is wide
 shairan sabase bada he or pluto ke zyada kareeb bhi he
 The center of their classes is somewhere in the middle rather than inside them
 isliye kabhi kabhi inhen yugmak vaale grah bhi kaha jaataa he jo ek duusare ke saath saath chalate hai
 The International Astronomical Union has not yet come up with a concrete definition of the gametes dwarf planets, so at the moment Sharon is officially considered a satellite of Yama
 1930 main america khagolashastri clide tombau ne pluto ko khoj nikaala or ise saura mandal kaa nauva grah maan liya gaya
 Gradually there were some things about Pluto that were different from other planets - in baton se khagolashastriyon ke man main shankaa ban gayi thi ke kahin pluto varun kaa koi bhaaga hua upgrah to nahin, haalanki isaki sambhaavna bhi kam thi kyonki pluto or varun parikrama karte hue kabhi zyaada paas nahin aate
 Then, after 1990, scientists began to find many cross-border objects whose orbits, looks and designs resembled those of Pluto
 aaj vaigyanikon ne yah pahchaan liya he ke saura mandal ke is ilaake main ek puraa gheraa he jisamen aisi hi vastuen paayi jaati hai jinamein se pluto sirf ek he
 This circle was named Kaiper Hoop

 Aris was also found outside the Kiper circle in 2005, which was larger than Pluto

 The International Astronomical Union was confused because it seemed that many such items would be found in the coming years
 yaa to yah sab grah the yaa phir pluto ko grah bulaanaa band karke kuch or bulaane kii zaroorat thi
 On 13 September 2006, the association announced that Pluto was not a planet and established a new "dwarf planet" category
 pluto, haumeya, makemake or siris ab boune grah kehalaate hai
 The New Horizons is a space research vehicle of the American space research organization NASA that was left to study Pluto

 Although Fangio achieved the title in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957, Ferrari's Alberto Askari, a two-time champion, blocked his winning streak
 Although Britain's Sterling Moss was able to compete regularly, he was never able to win the World Championship and is now widely regarded as a great driver for never winning the title
 haalanki, phangiyo ko formula van ke pehle dashak tak is championships par haaavee rahane ke liye yaad kiya jaataa he or lambe samay se unhen formula van kaa "grand master" mana jaataa he

 Due to the technological advancements of the 1990s, the cost of competition in Formula One increased dramatically
 Due to this increased financial burden and the dominance of the four teams together, poor independent teams struggled not only to remain competitive, but also to maintain their existence in business
 Financial troubles forced many teams to retreat
 Since 1990, twenty-eight teams have dropped out of Formula One

 Team orders, which had been valid since the start of the championship in 1950, were banned in 2002 after several incidents in which teams openly manipulated the results of the race gave rise to negative publicity, of which 2002 Ferrari's manipulation or negative publicity at the Australian Grand Prix was quite popular

 Under normal circumstances the winner of the race is the same driver who crosses the finish line first after completing a specified number of rounds followed by 260 km for a distance of approximately 305 km )
 Race officials can already finish the race due to unsafe conditions, such as rain, it should be finished within two hours, although only in case of very bad weather the races are likely to last so long
 driver res ke maarg par sthiti ke liye ek duusare se teji se aage nikal sakate hai or unhen usee kram main 'vargeekrut' kiya jaataa he jis kram main ve res ko puraa karte hai
 If a leader accidentally meets a back marker who has completed a few rounds, the back marker is shown a blue flag and is told that he is obliged to allow the leader to overtake himself
 dhimi car ko 'lapd' kaha jaataa he or, ek baar jab leader res ko puraa kar letaa he, to use 'van lap down' res ko puraa karne vaale ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 a driver can be cycled several times in front of any car
 jo driver, yantric samasyaon, durghatana, yaa kisi anya kaaran se res ko puraa kar paane main asafal ho jaataa he, use res se nikal jane ke liye kaha jaataa he or parinaamon main use 'vargeekrut nahin' kiya jaataa he
 However, if the driver has completed more than 90% of the distance of the race, then he / she will be classified

 a driver must stop at least once to use both tire pairs; Three pauses are usually taken, although further fixations may need to be taken to correct the damage or, if the weather conditions change
 formula van ke itihaas main res ke formet main thodaa badlaav aayaa he
 The main change revolves around that which is allowed at the pit stop
 grand pricks racing ke shuruaati dinon main, ek driver ko apane team ke saathi ke car main res ko chaalu rakhane kii anumati di jaati thi basharte uski samasya kaa vikaas hua ho; aajkal kaaron ko itnaa dhyanpurvak susajjit kiya jaataa he ki ab aisa hona naammumkin he
 In recent years, attention has been paid to changes in fuel refueling and tire replacement regulations
 2010 ke satr se, phir se eendhan bharne—jise 1994 main phir se shuru kiya gaya tha—kii anumati nahin he, jiskaa uddeshy suraksha ke maamalon ko lekar kam samrik racing ko protsaahit karnaa he
 The rule of both pairs of tires required during the race was implemented in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track

 Several systems have been used since the 1950s to award championship points
 2010 ke anusaar sheersh das kaaron ko ankon se sammanit kiya jaataa he, vijeta ko 25 ank praapt hote hai
 The total number of points gained in each race is added together and the driver and constructor who scores the most points at the end of the season are the world champions
 yadi donon kii ek team ke car ank praapt karke res ko puraa karte hai, to un donon ko constructors championships ank praapt hote hai, jiskaa matlab he ki drivers or constructors championships ke aksar alag-alag parinaam hote hai
 To get points, a driver has to be classified
 thik-thik kaha jaay to vargeekrut hone ke liye driver ko res puraa karne kii jarurat nahin he lekin jeetne vaale driver ke res kii duuri kaa kam se kam 90% puraa karnaa jaruri he
 Therefore, it is possible for a driver to get some points even when he is eliminated from the race before the race ends
 us halaat main jab res ke chakkaron ke 75% se bhi kam duuri tay kii gai ho to driveron or constructaron ko keval aadhe ankon se sammanit kiya jaataa he
 This has happened only five times in the history of the championship, including the last time on the occasion of the 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix when the race was called off after 31 rounds due to torrential rain and the championship winner on at least one occasion
 The decision was made
 ek driver satr ke dauraan team badal saktaa he or pichley team main praapt kisi bhi ank ko apane paas rakh saktaa he
 In 2010, Formula 1 revised its points system and decided to score the first ten drivers instead of eight or six in previous years
 1981 ke baad se formula van ke tiimon ko aisa chasis banane kii jarurat he jisamen ve pratiyogita karte hai or uske baad "team" or "constructor" shabd kamobesh antah parivartaneey ban gaye
 This requirement distinguishes the game from series, such as the indycar series, which allow teams to purchase chassis and "spec series", such as the GP2, which needs to keep all cars in the same specification
 yah prabhavi dhang se privacrs par bhi pratibandh lagaataa he, jo 1970 ke dashak main formula van main bhi bahut aam tha
 The first season of the game 1950 saw eighteen teams competing but due to too much expense many teams exited the competition very soon
 vastav main, formula van ke pehle dashak ke adhikansh samay tak pratispardhi kaaron kaa itnaa zyada abhaav tha ki grid ko bharne ke liye formula tu kaaron ko shaamil kiya gaya
 Ferrari is the only active team that competed in 1950
 praarambhik nirmaataa sahabhaagita "factory team" yaa "works team", jaise - alpha romeo, pheraari, yaa reynolt kii team, ke rup main saamne ai

 Ferrari holds the record for the most constructors' championship wins
 haalaanki 2000 ke dashak ke ant tak factory kii timen ek baar phir se patan ke raste par chalane lage, sirf pheraari, marcedes-benz or reynolt hi 2010 ke championships tak pravishtiyon ko darj karaane main safal hue hai
 Companies, such as Climax, Repco, Cosworth, Hart, Judd and Supertech, which had no direct relationship with the team, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to build them
 praarambhik varshon main swatantra rup se swaamitv vaali formula van timen kabhi-kabhi khud bhi ingine banaati thi, haalanki pramukh car nirmaataaon, jaise - BMW, pheraari, honda, marcedes-benz, reynolt or toyota, kii sahabhaagita main vruddhi hone se yah bahut kam aam ho gaya jinaki badi bajet vaali ingine nijee taur par nirmit injanon ko kam pratispardhi bana detii thim
 Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier, but lost its final customers after the 2006 season
 In early 2007, the manufacturers' sufficient funding and engineering capacity overtook the last independent engine manufacturers
 anumaan he ki pramukh timen keval injanon par prati nirmaataa prati varsh €100 or €200 million ke bich kii raashi kharch kar daalate hai
 In the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1984 rule, two teams used chassis manufactured by other teams
 super aguri ne honda racing RA106 kii ek sanshodhit chasis kaa istemaal karke satr shuru kiya, jabaki scudyria toro roso ne red bul racing RB3 kii ek sanshodhit chasis dwaara istemaal kiya gaya tha) kaa istemaal kiya
 There was nothing to be surprised in this decision as the cost is increasing, the Super Aguri is partially owned by Honda and the Toro Rosso is half owned by Red Bull
 formula van team spiker ne is nirnay ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai or anya tiimon, jaise - maclaren or pheraari, ne aadhikarik taur par is abhiyaan kaa samarthan karne kii pushti kii he
 This use of the chassis of other teams led to the 2006 season being the final season in which the terms "team" and "constructor" were actually interchangeable
 isane 2008 ke satr ke liye F1 ke liye prodrive team ko aakarshith kiya jahaan ise ek graahak car chalaanaa tha
 After not being able to secure a package from mclaren, and after Williams threatened to take legal action against him, Prodrive intended to enter the 2008 season
 ab, lagata he ki 2010 main aupchaarik rup se graahak kaaron par pratibandh lagaaya jayega
 Although teams rarely disclose information about their budgets, it is estimated that the budgets for each of them range from US $ 66 million to US $ 400
 formula van world championships main ek nai team ke pravesh ke liye FIA ko £25 million kii ek agrim raashi kaa bhugtan karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jise baad main satr ke dauraan team ko waapas kar diya jaataa he
 As a result, constructors wishing to enter Formula One often prefer to buy an existing team: Tyr by BAR and Jordan buying by Midland avoid both of these teams from accumulating huge sums and already the team Received a chance to secure the benefits received, such as TV revenue
 saanchaa:f1 constructors timeline Modern drivers are contracted for a team at least for the duration of the season, but drivers are often dropped out in the middle of a season or even replaced
 yadhyapi adhikansh driver kshamta ke balboote par apana pad hasil karte hai, lekin vanijyik vichaar bhi praayojakon or aapurtikartaaon ko santusht karne ke liye tiimon ke saath maidan main utaarte hai
 Most teams also have an additional driver, whom they bring to race weekends in case the main driver is injured or ill
 sabhi pratiyogiyon ke paas ek FIA super license hona jaruri he
 Each driver is assigned a number
 pichley satr ke champion ko number 1 ke rup main namit kiya jaataa he or saath main uske team-saathi ko number 2 diya jaataa he
 Each team is then ranked according to the position in the Constructors' Championship last season
 number 13 kaa istemaal nahin kiya jaataa he
 There are also some exceptions to this rule, such as in 1993 and 1994, when the current World Drivers' Champion was not competing in Formula One
 is maamle main pichley varsh ke champion ke team ke driveron ko number 0 or 2 die jate hai
 The number 13 has not been used since 1976, before which it was sometimes conferred at the discretion of individual race organizers
 1996 se pehle, keval world championships jeetne vaale driver or uski team aam taur par pichley champion ke saath numberon main pher-badal karte the-shesh ke paas purv varshon ke unke apane number hote the kyonki unhen mul rup se 1974 ke satr ke armbh main nirdhaarit kiya gaya tha
 For many years, for example, Ferrari had the numbers 27 and 28 regardless of their end position at the World Championship

 The British F3 has supplied a number of F1 drivers as well as champions including Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna and Mika Häkkinen, who have gone directly from that series to Formula One
 shaayad hi kisi driver ko usase bhi neeche ke str se liya ja saktaa he jaisaa ki 2007 ke world champion kimi racconen ke maamle main hua tha jo formula reynolt se sidhe F1 main chale gaye the

 However, a driver must have a FIA Super License for racing - which ensures that the driver has the requisite skills and therefore will not pose a threat to others
 Some drivers do not have this license when they first sign for an F1 team; Räikkönen was licensed despite only 23 car racing credits

 haalanki 1980 ke dashak se reson kii sankhya solah yaa satraa par rukii rahi, lekin yah sankhya 2005 main badhkar unniis ho gai
 Six of the original seven races took place in Europe; The only non-european race that counted like the World Championship in 1950 was the Indianapolis 500, which was later replaced by the United States Grand Prix due to F1's lack of team participation and the need for taxes with specialties different from other races
 F1 championships dhire-dhire anya gaiyr europea deshon main bhi fail gaya
 Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in 1953 and Morocco hosted the first African World Championship race in 1958
 After that, Asia and Oceania also hosted
 The current nineteen races have spread across continents such as Europe, Asia, Oceania, North America and South America

 a typical circuit typically involves a stretch of straight road on which the starting grid is located

 Many other circuits are also fully or partially mounted on public roads, such as spa-francorchamps
 The glamor and history of the Monaco race are the primary reasons why the circuits are still in use because it is believed to have not met the strict safety requirements imposed on other tracks
 teen baar world champion rah chuke nelson picket ne monaco main racing kii vyakhya bade shandaar dhang se nimna rup main kii "yah ek tarah se apane living rup main chaaron taraf cycle kii sawari karne jaisaa tha"
 Circuit designs designed with driver safety in mind are now being refined day by day, a living example being the new Bahrain International Circuit which was incorporated in 2004 and designed by Herman Tilk in a way Like most of the new circuits of F1

 For the Hockenheim circuit in Germany, for example, many people have resented the design they designed, providing more capacity for the grandstands and eliminating the much longer and dangerous straight path
 Argues that the position of the Hockenheim circuit was elongated, which went directly into the black wooded parts

 On 11 February 2016, it was announced in Washington, Germany, Hannover and some other countries cities together in the US that direct evidence of the existence of gravitational waves in the universe has been found
 khagolavidon kaa maananaa he ki gurutveey tarangon kii pushti ho jane ke baad ab brahmad kii utpatti ke kuch or rahasyon par se pardaa uth saktaa he
 Detection of gravitational waves is not easy because when they reach Earth, their amplitude is very small and the amount of distortion is about 10−21 which is very small in terms of measurement

 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment

 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn

 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation
 phir bhi eukeriots or bahukoshikeey jeevon ke bich yon prajnan prajnan ke adhik saamaanya saadhan hai
 The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to understand the importance of sexual reproduction as a means of enabling continuous development and adaptation in response to co-evolution with other species in an ever-changing environment

 It may therefore be a source of diversity that is new to the population or a species
 Gene flow may be due to the movement of individuals between different populations of organisms, as the movement of mice or grasses between inland and coastal populations
 k may be due to the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations

 Horizontal gene transfer refers to the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another that is not in its lineage; It is most common in bacteria

 It is possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal gene translocation between bacteria and Archaea
 gaharaa rang ke saath aabaadi main prakritik chayan parinaamon ke baad utparivartan
 From a neo-darwinian perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interracial organisms
 udhaaharan ke liye, patangon kii aabaadi main kaale rang ke liye aleble adhik saamaanya ho jate hai tantron jo elil aavritiyon main badlaav laa saktaa he, main prakritik chayan, anuvanshik bahaav, anuvanshik hichhiking, utparivartan or jin pravaah shaamil hai
 Main article: Natural selection natural sellection ke madhyam se vikaas prakriya he jiske dwaara jansankhya kii lagaataar pidiyon main astitv main vruddhi or prajnan adhik saamaanya ho jate hai
 It is often called the "self-sustaining" mechanism because it is necessary that according to three simple facts: akruti vigyaan, sharir vigyaan or vyavhaar ke sambandh main jeevon kii aabaadi ke bheetar bhinnata maujuud he
 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai
 The main concept of natural selection is the ability to develop an organism
 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "
 " mahatvapurn baat, elil kii fitness ek nishchit visheshta nahin he; agar paryaavaran main parivartan, pehle tatasth yaa hanikaarak lakshan phydemand ho sakate hai or pehle laabhakaari gun hanikaarak ho jate hai
 However, even if the direction of selection is reversed in this way, symptoms lost in the past may not re-develop into a uniform form
 ek visheshta ke liye aabaadi ke bheetar prakritik chayan, jo vibhinn prakaar ke mulyon jaise oonchai par bhinn ho sakate hai, ko teen alag-alag prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he pehla dishaatmak chayan hota he, jo ki samay ke saath ek vishesh gun ke ausat mulya main badlaav hota he- udhaaharan ke liye, jeev dhire-dhire oonche ho jate hai
 Second, disruptive selection is selection for highly trait values and often becomes the most common of the two different values, with selection against the mean value
 yah tab hoga jab yaa to laghu yaa ucch jeevon kaa ek phayda hota he, lekin madhyam oonchai ke nahin hote ant main, chayan ko sthir karne main donon ore donon ore ke charam vishesh gunon ke bich chayan hota he, jo ausat mulya or kam vividhta ke aas-paas bhinnata ko kam karata he
 This, for example, causes organisms to gradually become all the same height
 natural sellection kaa ek vishesh maamla yon chayan hota he, jo kisi bhi gun ke liye chayan hota he jo sambhog kii safalataa ko badhaata he or sambhavit mitron ke jeevon ke aakarshan ko badhaata he
 Characteristics developed through sexual selection are especially prominent among males of many animal species
 yadhyapi kaamuk rup se isht, haalanki bojhil sing, sangat kol, bade sharir ke aakaar or ujjwal rang jaise lakshan aksar prerana ko aakarshith karte hai, jo ki vyaktigat purushon ke astitv se samjhauta karte hai
 This survival loss is balanced by high reproductive success in men who show these difficult-to-fake, sexually selected traits
 natural sellection sabase aam taur par swabhaav ko maapta he jiske khilaaf vyaktiyon or vyaktigat gunon ko jivit rahane kii adhik sambhaavna he
 In this sense "nature" refers to an ecosystem, namely a system in which organisms interact with all other elements in their local environment, both physically and biologically
 paristhitiki tantra ke sansthaapak ujin odum ne ek paristhitiki tantra ko paribhaashit kiya he: "kisi bhi ikai main sabhi jeevon ko shaamil kiya jaataa he

 "within an ecosystem each population lives in a specific place or position with different relationships in other parts of the system
 in rishton main jeev kaa jivan itihaas, khaadya shrinkhalaa main isaki sthiti or isaki bhugolic seemaa shaamil he
 This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to characterize specific forces that, together, include natural selection
 prakritik chayan sanghathan ke vibhinn staron par kaary kar saktaa he, jaise ki jin, koshika, vyaktigat jeev, jeevon or prajatiyon ke samooh
 Selection can work at multiple levels simultaneously
 vyaktigat jeev ke str ke neeche hone vaale chayan kaa ek udhaaharan transporens naamak jin he, jo ek jinom main dohraane or fail saktaa he
 Selection at a level above the individual, such as group selection, may allow for the development of cooperation, as described below yah bhi dekhen: maanav kaa vikaas See also: History of Earth adhik jaankaree: abiogenesis, pencparmia, or arene vishwa kii avadharanaprithvi 4

 vartmaan prajatiyaan vikaas kii prakriya main ek charan hai, unki vividhta ke saath prajati or vilupt hone kii ghatnaon kii lambii shrinkhalaa kaa utpaada he
 The common ancestry of organisms is first inferred from four simple facts about organisms: First, they have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptation

 puruvansheey udayan vatsa rajya ke raja the
 His capital name was Kaushambi
 unheen dinon avanti rajya, jisaki rajdhani ujjayini thi, main pradyot naam ke raja rajya karte the
 Maharaj Pradyot was the owner of a very large military force, so he was also known as Mahasen
 maharaj udayan ke paas ghoshvati naamak ek divya veena thi
 His veena-playing was unique
 ek baar pradyot ke amaatya shalankayan ne chal karke udayan ko kaid kar liya
 Hearing the fame of Udayan's veena-playing, Pradyot appointed him as the veena-teacher for his daughter, Vasavadatta
 is dauraan udayan or vaasavadatta me madhya ek duusare ke prati aasakti jaagrit ho gai
 Here, Udayan's minister Yauangandharayan was trying to free him from captivity
 yaugandharayan ke chaaturya se udayan, vaasavadatta ko saath le kar, ujjayini se nikal bhaagane main safal ho gayi or kaushambi aakar unhone vaasavadatta se vivaah kar liya
 Udayan was so lost in the love of virtuosity that he could not even remember the Kingdom work
 is sthiti kaa laabh uthaa kar aaruni naamak unke krur shatru ne unke rajya ko unase chin liya
 His minister Yoongandharayana and Rumwan were trying to take back the kingdom of Udayan from Aruni
 kintu bina kisi anya rajya kii sahaayta ke aaruni ko parrast nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Vasavadatta's father Pradyot was angry with Udayan and Yaugandharayana did not expect any kind from him
 yaugandharayan ko jyotishiyon ke dwaara pataa chalata he ki magadh-naresh kii bahan padmavati kaa vivaah jin naresh se hoga ve chakravarti samraat ho jaayenge
 Yoongandharayana thought that if Padmavati is married to Udayana in any way, Udayan will definitely get his Vatsa kingdom back from Aruni and he will also become Chakravarti emperor
 yaugandharayan maharaj udayan ke vivaah padmavati se karvaa dene kii apni yojana ke vishay main vaasavadatta ko bataaya
 Vasavadata, who wishes her husband all the best, agreed to this marriage
 kintu yaugandharayan bhaleebhanti jaanate the ki udayan apni patni vaasavadatta se aseem prem karte hai or ve apane duusare vivaah ke liye kadaapi raji nahin honge
 Therefore, he made a plan together with Vasavadatta and another minister, Rummavan
 yojana ke anusaar udayan ko rajpariwaar tathaa vishwaasapaatr sahyogiyon ke saath lekar akhet ke liye van main bheja gaya jahaan ve sabhi log shivi main rahane lage
 One day, when Udayan had left for Mrigaya, the camp was set on fire
 udayan ke waapas lautne par rumnvan ne unhen bataaya ki vaasavadatta shivi main lagi aag main fas gayi thim or unhen bachaane ke liye yaugandharayan vahaan ghuse jahaan par donon hi jal mare
 Udayan was deeply saddened by this news, but Rumwan and other Amatya handled him in many ways by giving them solace
 idhar yaugandharayan vaasavadatta ko saath lekar parivrajak ke vesh main magadh raajputree padmavati ke paas pahunch gaye or prachhann vaasavadatta ko padmavati ke paas dharohar ke rup main rakh diya
 Avantika became Padmavati's special grace character
 unhone maharaj udayan kaa gungan kar kar ke padmavati ko unke prati aakarshith kar liya
 Udayan did not want to get a second marriage, but Rummavan persuaded him to get married to Padmavati
 is prakaar udayan kaa vivaah padmavati ke saath ho gaya
 After marriage, Udayan with the help of Magadha-king attacked Aruni and defeated him and took back his kingdom
 ant main atyant naatakeey dhang se yaugandharayan or vaasavadatta ne swayan ko prakat kar diya
 Yoongandharayana pleaded forgiveness for his audacity and audacity

 They keep calling 'ha Vasavadatta', 'ha Vasavadatta' in the dream, at the same time Avantika reaches there
 ve unke latakate huye haath ko bistar par rakh kar nikal jaati hai kintu usee samay udayan kii neend khul jaati he
 They are not able to decide whether they have actually seen vasavadatta or in a dream
 isi ghatana ke ke kaaran naatak kaa naam ‘swapnvasavadatta’ rakhaa gaya
 The word church is a corruption of the Greek adjective literally meaning "of the Lord"
 vastav main carch do arthon main prayukt he; ek to prabhu kaa bhawan arthath girjaghar tathaa doosraa, isaayiyon kaa sanghathan
 In addition to the church, the term 'congregation' also operates
 yah unani bible ke 'eklesia' shabd kaa vikrut rup he; bible main iskaa arth he - kisi sthanvishesh athwa vishwa bhar ke isaayiyon kaa samudaay
 Later this word started being used for the church as well
 yahan par sanstha ke arth main carch par vichaar kiya jaayga
 All Christians often agree that Jesus established only one church, but the unity of Christians could not remain intact for many reasons
 falswaroop aajkal unke bahut se carch athwa sanghathan vartmaan hai jo ek duusare se purnataya swatantra hai
 They can be classified as follows: isai dharm kii praarambhik shatabdiyon main carch kii paribhaasha tathaa uske swaroop ke vishay main apekshaakrit kam chintan kiya gaya he
 It is clear from the description of the biography and teachings of Jesus in the Bible that from the very beginning Christians believed that Christianity provided the means of salvation for all mankind and for this purpose established the "kingdom of God" on earth
 
 "ishwar kaa rajya" un logon kaa samudaay he jo isa ke ishwartv par vishwaas kar unki shiksha grahan karte hai
 In the Bible, that community is called "god to the people"
 uske sanghathan tathaa shashan ke liye isa ne 12 shishyon ko chunakar unhen vishesh shikshan tathaa adhikaar die or aadesh diya ki ve duniya bhar main jaakar unki shiksha kaa prachaar karen tathaa vishwaas karanevaalon ko baptism sanskaar karke carch main sammilit kar len
 Thus, in the Bible, the community of followers of Jesus is called the church, "the kingdom of God" and "the people of God"
 in padon se aisa prathit ho saktaa he ki prarambh main carch ke vaastavik rup ko bahari sanghathan tak simit mana gaya he, kintu aisi baat nahin he
 Jesus has emphasized in his teaching that there is invisible and mystical unity between him and his true followers
 unhone apane shishyon se kaha- "main draksha lata hoon or tum daaliyaan ho
 "this makes it clear that the most important element of the church is spiritual
 sant paulus ne carch ke is aadhyatmik tathaa rahasyatmak paksh par bahut bal diya he
 In his letters, he has repeatedly called the Church "the spiritual body of Christ" to illustrate the spiritual connection of Jesus and his true followers and the mysterious unity of all followers of Jesus
 at: prarambh hi se carch ke bahari sanghathan tathaa uske aadhyatmik swaroop, donaan kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 When the Church broke out due to Protestant religion, the religious people began to think more about the nature of the church
 protestant vidvan carch ke adrishy swaroop par or pratikriyaswaroop katholic dharmapandit carch ke bahari sanghathan, uski drishy sadsyta aadi par adhik bal dene lage
 In this controversy, he has given more importance to the four external characteristics of the church
 isa kaa sachcha carch katholic he ; ek he, prem ke bandhan main ek hokar uske sabhi sadsy ek se dharmasiddhanton par vishwaas karte hai
 One accepts the sacrament, the same worshiping ritual and the rule of the same goddess; Is holy; Has apposles carch ke drishy sanghathan main kuch aise log bhi sammilit ho sakate hai jo paakhandee hai, jinka isa ke saath koi aadhyatmik sambandh nahin he, jo isa ke aadhyatmik sharir ke ang nahin hai
 God only knows who is a true member of the church and for this reason it can be assumed that the real church is invisible
 phir bhi us adrishy vaastavik carch kii purna sadsyta kii anivaary shart bahari sanskaar hi hai, at: adrishy carch se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Nowadays, almost all Protestants also believe this
 mukti ke liye carch kii purna sadsyta apekshit hote hue bhi anivaary nahin he
 God wants the salvation of all people and produces inspiration in the conscience of all human beings
 jo ishwar kii prerana par chalate hai ve anjaane hi adrishy rup se carch ke apurna sadsy ban jate hai or isa dwaara pradutt mukti praapt kar sakate hai
 After the Second World War, the movement for unity of the Church in the Christian world began to be given more importance
 falswaroop khandan-mandan ko chhodkar bible main vidyaman tatwon ke aadhaar par carch ke vaastavik rup ko nirdhaarit karne ke prayaas main isapar apekshaakrit adhik bal diya jane laga ki carch isa kaa aadhyatmik sharir he
 Jesus is its head and true Christians are parts of that body

 The most successful of the first missionaries was Saint Paul; a description of his travels and his letters are preserved in the latter part of the Bible
 us samay antiok roman samrajya kaa teesraa shahar tha, is kaa uttaradhikari sant petrus yaheen chale aae or us centre se sant paulus ne asia miner, maasedonia tathaa yunaan main isai dharm kaa prachaar kiya
 Later the capital Rome became the principal center of Christianity
 vahiin sant petrus or sant paulus shahid ho gaye
 The latter half of the Bible was written in the late first century AD
 san 100 i

 By the end of the third century Christianity had spread to all the cities of the vast Roman Empire; At the same time many people in Persia and South Russia also became Christians
 is safalataa ke kai kaaran hai
 One, there was strong religion among the people at that time, secondly Christianity taught the importance of every human being, whether he was a slave or a woman
 iske atirikt isaayiyon main jo bhaatrubhaav tha usase log prabhavit hue bina nahin rah sake
 2
 The greatest feature of the history of the first three centuries is that at the time, the Christians were persecuted by the rulers and instead of giving up their religion in large numbers, they accepted blasphemy and death
 yadhyapi roman shaasha prarambh hi se us nae dharm ko andeh kii drushti se dekhte the or uske anuyaayiyon ko sataate the, phir bhi keval teesri shatabdi main isai dharm ko purna rup se mitaane kaa dhyaapak praytn kiya gaya tha, vishesh rup se desius, dyoklishan, muskiminian or gallarius ke shasankaal main 
 3
 The organization was as follows: In every city, the local church clergyman was called the bishop, under his rule the priest and deputy priest were engaged in religious activities
 rome, sikandriy, antiok main bishpon ko petriark kii oopaadhi di jaati thi kintu sarvatra rome ke bishap kaa vishesh adhikaar mana jaataa tha

 Early Christian literature is written primarily in the Greek language
 origen or sant ireneyas vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 Irenaeus, opposing the then misleading assumptions, declared the teaching of the Roman Church to be the test of true Christian teaching
 unhone adhiktar isai goongyaanavaad kaa khandan kiya
 Gnosticism had been going on since before Christ but later it incorporated Christian elements
 us vaad kaa moolbhoot siddhant he ki samast bhautik jagat or maanavsharir bhi dooshit he
 In one way or the other, this theory survived for centuries

 At that time unrest began to spread in the Christian world due to the belief of Arius

 Later Islam seized Syria and Egypt from the empire and most of the people there joined that new religion
