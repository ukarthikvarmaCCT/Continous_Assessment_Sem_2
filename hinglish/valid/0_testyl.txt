 Sputnik 1 helped identify the high density of atmospheric layers by measuring the change in its orbit and described the distribution of radiata in the ionosphere
 Because this satellite was filled with increased pressurized nitrogen, also for Sputnik 1 Provided the first opportunity for meteorite detection, internal pressure was sent back to Earth as a loss due to the entry of meteorites to the outer surface The temperature must have been evident in the description
 The unexpected announcement of the success of Sputnik 1 revived the Sputnik crisis in the United States and ignited the so-called space race within the Cold War

 One of England's best batsmen of the 19th century, English batsman William Gilbert Grace was notorious for pinching in a funny tone
 ek baar clin bold hone ke baad unhone wicket par gilliyon ko lagaaya or kaha- "ampire aaj hawa bahut tej chal rahi he
 "the umpire replied-" Yes, rightly said, take care of your hat while going to the pavilion
 " In another incident, he was lbw, but was not ready to leave the ground
 unhone tark diya ki, "ye jo darshak aae hai ve meri ballebaaji dekhne aae hai na ki aapako gendbaaji karte dekhne
 "however perhaps the best answer to Grace's abusive tendency was given by bowler Charles Courtright
 gres ko out karne kii unki baar-baar kii koshishen naakaam hone or ampire dwaara gres ko out dene se inkaar karne se pareshaan cotrit ne aakhirkaar gres ke do viketon ko maidan par gira diya
 When Grace started returning to the pavilion with a heavy heart, Courtright said to her farewell- "doctor sir, what are you going in right? But one stump is still standing
 " West Indies batsman Viv Richards was famous for teaching a lesson to bowlers who dare to abuse themselves
 richards kaa itnaa dar tha ki kai captainon ne to apane khilaadiyon ko apshabd kehane par hi pabandi laga di thi
 However, once in a county match against Glamorgan, Greg Thomas tried to abuse Richards when he failed to hit multiple consecutive balls
 thomas ne richards se kaha tha- "agar aap hairaan hai, soch rahe hon to aapako bataa duun ki ye laal rang kii gol gend he or ye kareeb paanch ouns vajani he
 "richards hit Thomas's next ball so that he went into a nearby river outside the cricket ground
 phir gendbaaj kii ore ghoomte hue unhone kaha- "greg, chunki aap jaanate hai ki ye kis tarah dikhti he, isliye ab jaaie or use dhundh kar le aaie
 " australia main khel ke zyaadaatar staron par apshabdon kii pravriti aam he, lekin jis ek australian khilaadi ko apshabd kehane ke maamle main khaas maharath hasil thi, ve the tej gendbaaj marv huge
 His style of bullying and aggressive bowling often consisted of a mixture of witty remarks and sarcasm

 However, there have been many occasions by Hugh to say abusive words that can be called memorable
 aisa hi ek mauka tha jab huge pakistan ke ballebaaj javed miyandad ko gendbaaji kar rahe the, tab ballebaaj ne huge se kaha tha ki wo bas ke ek mote bas conductor kii tarah dikh rahe hai
 On the very next ball, Hughes bowled Miandad and ran to his fellow players to celebrate, shouting, "please buy tickets!" apshabd kehane kii ye pravriti 2007-08 main bhartiya dal ke australia daure ke dauraan media kii surkhi tab bani, jab harbhajan singh par andru symonds par kathith taur par nasleey tippanee karne ke aarope lage the
 This charge could not be proved and the ban of three matches against Harbhajan was withdrawn
 isaki jagah par unhen level 2
8 ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya gaya, jise unhone sweekaar bhi kiya or un par match shulk ke pachaas fisadi kaa jurmaana lagaaya gaya
 However, the Appeal Commissioner later said that if he had known about Harbhajan's old behavior, then a match would have been banned
 symonds ne sweekaar kiya tha ki unhone hi do khilaadiyon ke bich aakraamak bhashaa kaa prayog kar apshabd kehane kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Although trying to divert the attention of opponents by verbally abusing is very common in almost all sports, the term "abusive tendency" has become a part of cricket in itself
 anya khelon main kai baar maukhik taur par apshabd kehane kii apni shabdaawalee hoti he

 yatra se lautakar unhone apane gaanv yasnaya polyana main krishakon ke bacchon ke liye ek skool kholaa
 The education system of this school was very progressive
 isamen vartmaan parikshapranali evam iske aadhaar par uteern anuteern kaarne kii vyavastha nahin rakhi gai thi
 The school was a big success mainly due to Tolstoy's leadership power and heartfelt passion towards him
 vidhyalay kii ore se, gaanv ke hi naam par ""yasnaya polyana"" naamak ek patrika bhi nikalati thi jisamen prakashit tollstoy ke lekhon main vidhyalay ore uske chaatro kii vibhinn samasyaon par bade hi sargarbhit vichaar vyakt hue hai
 In 1862, Tolstoy was married to a high-ranking elite woman named Safia Berhus
 unke vaivaahik jivan kaa purvaash to bada sukhad rahaa par uttaransh katutapurna beetaa
 In Tolstoy's married life, the ideal of a housewife was completely similar to that of an Indian housewife: but the views of the then Russian elite society were quite different
 1863 se 1869 tak tollstoy kaa samay "waar and pis" kii rachana main evam 1873 se 76 tak kaa samay "anna karenina" kii rachana main beetaa
 Both these compositions greatly elevated Tolstoy's literary fame
 ve manushyajivan kaa rahasy or uske tatvachintan ke prati vishesh jaagruk the
 The period from 1875 to 1879 was very disappointing for him - he had lost his faith in God and had taken off on committing suicide
 par ant main unhone isapar vijay pai
 In 1878–79, he composed his controversial work called "confession"
 iske krantikari vichaar aise hai jinke kaaran rus main iske prakaashan kii anumati bhi nahin mili or pustak switsraland main prakashit hui
 Many of his other compositions of this time are of this category and they are all printed in Switzerland
 1878 se lekar 1885 tak kii avadhi main falaatmak sahitya srijan kii drushti se tollstoy niskriy rahe
 His intuition remained entangled in the search for the secret of human life
 ambtak kii samast rachanaayen unhen vyarth prathit hone lageen
 But in 1886, he again appeared as a high-profile well-known writer and in the same year published his great novel work "the Death of Ivan Ilyich"
 unke aachaar sambandhi vishwaason ke prati ab sara sansar aakrishth ho chukaa tha or yasnaya polyana gram kii manyata utkrisht tirthasthali ke rup main jagaddhikhyath ho chuki thi
 Our Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi was a young man at this time
 inhen dinon unhone tollstoy kii rachanaayen ruchipurvak padhi thim or unki ore aakrisht hue the
 Towards the end of the 19th century, Tolstoy's service to the poor and helpless grew to such an extent that he donated all his income from his creations to Russia
 apni patni ko maatr utana ansh lene kii unhone anumati di jitna parivaar ke bhar poshan ke liye anivaary tha
 He gave all the proceeds of his novel called 'resurgence' to the Russian pacifist caste Dukhbor people to abandon Russia and settle in Canada
 1910 main sahasaa unhone apane paitrik gram "yasnaya polyana" ko sarvada ke liye parityakt karne kaa nishchay kiya

 unki dharmabhavana badi udaar or vyapak thi
 He had a clear antagonism towards the then Christianity
 apane vichaaron se ve ek prakaar ke sarvadevvaadi prathit hote hai
 He considered death as the inevitable end of the body
 manushya ko ve sharir kii antim or avashyambhavi parinti maanate the
 He considered it appropriate to assess everything that came in contact with human beings from the criteria of utility and for this reason he always remained curious about the purpose of life
 niruddeshy, vichaarheen ore aatmakendrit jivan ko ve ek prakaar kaa paap maanate the; yahan tak ki sambhog ko ve keval santanotpatti ke uddeshy se hi vihit maanate the
 In psychological works, Fyodor Dostoyevsky equates Tolstoy
 galswardi, tamas maan, juls romyna aadi mahaan lekhakon par tollstoy kaa ullekhneey prabhaav padaa he
 Later Russian writers have also been strongly influenced by Tolstoy
 lenin sahit vishwa ke anekanek vidwaanon ne tolastoy ke sahitya, visheshtah 'yuddh or shaanti' kii sarvshereshthata muktakanth se sweekaar kii he; parantu tolastoy ek vichaarak bhi the or saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath-saath nibandhon tathaa anya vidhaon main bhi unhone apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii he
 Regarding the usefulness of his age-old reference ideas, Lenin believes that "tolstoy has created such fine literature that will always be valuable and readable to the public, when he overturns the zamindars and the capitalists and arranges a social life for himself Will do it
 saath hi tolastoy ullekhneey oj ke saath vartmaan vyavastha main paddalit aam janata kii manodasha ko vyakt karne tathaa uski dasha kaa varnan karne tathaa uske virodh evam rosh ke swatahsfoort bhaavon ko mukherit karne main samarth hue hai
 Tolstoy mainly belonged to the era from 1861 to 1904 and has - as an artist, thinker and preacher - highlighted in his works the historical peculiarities of the First Russian Revolution, its capabilities and flaws with surprising clarity
 " Despite this, in the context of the various flaws of the ancient system, the internal vacuity of the rich class and the views of Tolstoy appearing against him, Lenin states that "there was nothing new in Tolstoy's criticism
" unhone koi aisi baat nahin kahi jo unase bahut arase pehle europea tathaa roosi sahitya main mehanatakashon ke himytiyon dwaara na kahi gayi ho
 The characteristic and historical significance of Tolstoy's criticism is that the radical change in the attitude of the mass people of Russia - the pastoral, peasants of our period - is expressed in such a way, Which was just the work of a talented artist
 " Lenin understood Tolstoy's literary significance very well and therefore he has praised him heavily; But at the same time he also understood the imperative of being aware of many harmful aspects of his ideas in the era
 isliye disambar 1910 main unhone spashtatya yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastoy kii saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa adhyayan karke roosi majdoor varg apane dushmano ko zyada acchhee tarah pahchaan sakegaa
 By studying his principles, the entire Russian public will know what his personal weakness, which prevented him from fulfilling his goal of independence, was contained
 aage badhane ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he
 All those who are obstructing this progress, declare Tolastoy as 'the conscience of all of us', 'life-teacher'
 yah vah jhooth he jise udaarataavaadi jo tolastoy ke siddhanton ke kranti-virdohi pahalu kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, jaanboojhkar failaa rahe hai
 Tolstoy's lie of being a 'life-teacher' is seen by some former social-democrats who are seen by liberals
 roosi janata aazaadee tabhi praapt karegi, jab vah samaj legi ki use behatar jivan ke liye sangharsh karne kii shiksha tolastoy se nahin, balki us varg se leni he, jiskaa mahatv tolastoy nahin samaj paye or jo us puraani duniya ko, jisase tolastoy ghrinaa karte the, ukhaad phenkane main samarth ekmaatr varg he -- arthath sarvhaara varg se
 Lenin again elaborated on 22 January 1911, citing some of Tolstoy's narrative works, as well as several non-fiction works, expressing the view that despite being a reactionary and utopian element in Tolstoyism, some circles of the public 25 years ago For perhaps, critical elements of Tolstoy's theories could have had practical utility
 par ab, udhaahrantah pichley dashak main, aisi baat nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki pichhali shatabdi ke nauven dashak se lekar shatabdi ke ant tak aitihaasik vikaas bahut aage bad gaya he
 So today, when the above events have put an end to the 'eastern' stagnation, today, when the consciously reactionary, narrow-class and selfish-class meanings of 'vakhi' cults spread so widely among the liberal bourgeoisie Gone, today, when some of the Marxists, who are showing the contagion of these ideas, have also felt that the result is the 'immersionist' tendency, then respect the principles of Tolastoy To justify or smuggle their 'disrespect', their 'soul' woes, their call for 'self-realization', the principle of 'conscience' and world 'love', their teachings of austerity and Quietism, etc
 Every effort to do it is the direct and deepest loss

 Despite such a big difference, there is a commonality that threads the country into one thread

 Kalsunia is a village in Champawat district of Kumaon division under Uttarakhand state of India in Sri Purnagiri Tanakpur tehsil
 saundaryashastra samvednaatmak-bhaavnaatmak gun-dharm or mulyon kaa adhyayan he
 Aesthetics is the representation of art, culture and nature
 saundaryashastra, darshanashastra kaa ek ang he
 It is also called Soundaryamimansa and Anandamimansa
 soundaryashastra vah shaastra he jisamen kalatmak kritiyon, rachanaaon aadi se abhivyakt hone vaala athwa unamem nihit rahane vaale saundarya kaa tathvik, darshanik or maarmik vivechan hota he
 The main purpose of this is to discuss the nature and nature of the joyful feeling in our mind by looking at a beautiful object and to coordinate it with other sensations of life
 saundaryashastra darshan kii ek shakha he jiske tahat kala, sahitya or sundarata se sambandhit prashnon kaa vivechan kiya jaataa he
 There is a word in the Greek language 'esthetico' which implies the derivation of 'esthetics', for the sense that is received by sense perception apart from the realm of knowledge
 prakruti, kala or sahitya se sambandhit clasical saundaryashastreey drushtikon viksit hua
 This approach keeps the political and contextual dimensions of the work out of the scope of the work, keeping its concern only with the beauty and art form
 lekin kala or sahitya vivechna kii kuch aisi vidhiyaan bhi hai jo kritiyon ke taatpary or unki rachana-prakriya ke saamaajik or aitihaasik pahaluon se samvaad sthapit karti hai
 Marxist aesthetics is one such discourse
 pracheen unani darshan main plato kii rachana hippiaz major main saundarya kii avadharana par charchaa milti he
 Aristotle's thoughts on the sad style of play in his poetics have influenced art-criticism for a long time
 kala or saundarya par hue gair-pashchimi pracheen chintan ke sandarbh main bharat ke naatyashaastra, abhinavgupt ke ras-siddhant or chini vidwaan cheng yin-yuvan kii rachana lee-tai ming-hua chi dwaara prastut anuthe or vistrut vimarshon kaa loha pashchimi jagat main bhi mana jaataa he
 non-western standards for interpreting this tradition of art-practice have not yet been formed, and interpretations made through Western standards have yielded unsatisfactory results
 pashchimi vichaar-jagat main ek darshanik gatividhi ke taur par saundaryashastra kii pruthak sankalpana attharahavin sadi main ubhari jab kala-kritiyon kaa anushilan hast-shilp se alag karke kiya jane laga
 This resulted in the formulation of the concept of fine arts by theorists
 alexander gottaleeb bomgaarten ne 1750 main esthetica likh kar ek bahes kaa sutarapaat kiya
 Seven years later, the emerging discourse of aesthetics was questioned by David Hume writing 'of the Standard of Tests'
 lekin aadhunik europee saundaryashastreey vimarsh kii vaastavik shuruyaat emanuel kaant kii 1790 main prakashit rachana 'critic of jajment' se hui
 In this work, Kant insisted on universalizing the criterion of aesthetics
 lekin duusari ore ve kisi bhi tarah ke saarvbhaum saundaryashastra kii sambhaavna par andeh karte hue bhi nazar aaye
 Despite this contradiction, Kant's achievement was that he established some essential dialects to explore art and beauty
 in dvibhajanon main sarvaadhik ullekhneey hai : indriyabodh or tark-buddhi, sarawastu or rup, abhivyakti or abhivyakt, anand or upsanhaar, swatantraaa or aavashyaktaa aadi
 Kant's second achievement was that he distinguished between aesthetic experience and aesthetic experience
 unka kahana tha ki saundaryashastreey vyakhya or uski nishpatti vishleshan ke lakshya ke prati bina kisi vyaavhaarik aasakti ke hi kii jaani chahie
 The nineteenth century can be said to be a century of aesthetics
 kaant kii banaayi gayi zamin par hi baad main german vidwaanon ne saundaryashastra kaa vrihattar darshanik dhaanchaa khadaa kiya
 Hegel in his works Lectures on Esthetics, Schopenhaur in The World as Will and Representation and Nietzsche in Fine Births of Tragedy gave various interpretations of various aspects of Western aesthetics and published new dimensions
 unnisvin sadi ke aakiri daur main angrezi bhashi saundaryashastra main rupvaad kaa ubhaar hua
 Victorian Britain gave the slogan 'for the art of art', among whose spokespersons Oscar Wilde's name is notable
 vishuddh saundaryashastreey anubhav par bal dene vaale rupavaadi drushtikon ne lagbhag sabhi kshetron main aadhunik kala-roopon ko gaharaai se prabhavit kiya
 But the sounds of opposition to this movement were made by the great Russian litterateur Leo Tolstoy, What is Art? And narrated the work of John Dewey, the leading spokesman for American consequentialism, in Art as Experience
 tolstoy kaa tark tha ki jo kala manushyon ke bich naitik anubhutiyon kaa sampreshan nahin kar sakati, vah rupavaadi kasautiyon ke hisaab se kitni bhi mahaan kyon na ho, uski saraahna nahin kii ja sakati
 Divi also protested against art being cut from the structures of experience outside the realm of aesthetics in the name of aesthetics, taking ironics from the question of the role of communication
 saundaryashastreey chintan kii german parampara beesvin sadi main bhi jari rahi
 Aesthetic theories were further enriched using tools of phenomenology, hermeneutics and Marxism
 1936 main martin haidagar ne ‘da orijan of da work of art’ jaisaa niabandh likhaa jise kala ke darshan kii sarvshereshth rachanaaon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Heidegger claimed in this essay that viewing art work as an object in this world is one of the fundamental semiotic errors of modernity
 hidagar ke mutabik kala to ek naye jagat ke dwaar kholti he, kala ke rup main satya apane-aap main ghatata hi nahin hamaare apane anubhav ke daayre main vastuon ke astitv kaa udghaatan bhi karata he
 In this way, through aesthetics, Heidegger criticized modernity and took on traditional existential epistemology and technological interpretation of things
 beesvin sadi ke madhya tak saundaryashastra kii upyogita par sawaal uthne lage
 In some of his lectures given at the beginning of the century, Edward Bulow had asked the question whether the definitions of art and beauty were eroding the creation-ability of the artist
 ye vyaakhyaan 1957 main chape or saath ke dashak main america kalakaar barnet newman ne elaan kar diya ki saundaryashastra kaa upyog kala ke liye vahi he jo pakshishastra kaa pakshiyon ke liye hai
 That is, an artist ignorant of aesthetics is good
 samskruti-adhyayan ke tahat saundaryashastra ke abhijanonmukh rujhaanon kii kadi pariksha kii gayi he
 Pierre Bordeaux not only identified the ideological underpinnings of art under the sociology of culture, but also stated that aesthetics has not been able to establish its own cultural and political roots
 bordiyo ke is vichaar kaa pratwaad adorno kii rachana esthetic thiyari main miltaa he
 Adorno cites the example of twentieth-century non-standard art, saying that art still has the potential to counter ideology
 adorno ke mutabik kala apane samaaj kii upaj zarur hoti he, par uskaa rachana- prakriya main saamaajik niyatatvavaad se swytt kshan bhi nihit hota he
 Therefore, it also gives the artist and his audience or reader an opportunity to think in ways other than those used by the then dominant culture
 kuch marxvaadi vidwaanon ne saundaryashastra kii ek marxvaadi shrenee viksit karne kii koshish bhi kii he
 In view of such efforts from a critical point of view, the leading Marxist literary critic Namwar Singh of Hindi has considered the first example of this as the creation of 'socialist Realism' in the Soviet Union
 unhone kaha he, ‘shaastra banate hi saamaajik yatharth bhi sutarabaddh ho gaya or us yatharth ko abhivyakt karne kii style bhi
 a new formalism got under way, both in composition and in criticism
 jis desh ne samaajawaadee kranti kii, vah sahitya or kala ke kshetra main koi kranti karne se thithak gaya
 Such an insult to reality was not even in the literature before the revolution, and not even in the literature of the nineteenth century Europe when the Bourgeois Revolution gave rise to realism
 haalat bahut kuch hindi kii ritivaadee kahi janevaali sahitya-pravriti kii- si ho gayi, jab alankarishastra ke lakshan granthon ko saamne rakh kar kavitaayen likhi ja rahi thim
 ' namvar singh ne doosraa udhaaharan jorge lukach dwaara rachit saundaryashastra naamak vishaal granth kaa diya he
 He describes it as a monumental attempt by Lukach to finally compile his nearly sixty years of long literature into an orderly scripture, 'this huge text of thousands of pages is still available in the German language and which the Germans would know well, He will be able to say something confident about it
 angrezi main abhi tak uske bare main jo kuch kaha gaya he or uske chhitput anshon se jo abhas mila he uske aadhaar par itnaa to kaha hi ja saktaa he ki isamen samast kalaon ko ‘anukaran’ main nisshesh karne kii asafal cheshtaa kii gayi he
 In this way, when the Marxist Lukach goes on tying all the arts into one scripture, he is ultimately forced to go to Aristotle
 kisi angrezi saptahik ne is granth kii samiksha ke saath ek aisa cartoon chapa tha, jisamen lukach marks kii dadhi ke saath arestu kii shakl- surat or poshaak main pesh aate hai
 Namvar Singh believes that Lukach's parable reveals a weak aspect of this long tradition of Marxist aesthetics
 ve kehete hai ki ‘aksar vah swayan ‘kala’ naamak sanstha ko chunauti dene main chook gaya or kala kii clasiki paribhaasha ko sweekaar kar lene main use koi haani nahin dikhaai padi
 Once these definitions are accepted in the basic form, then with some manipulation, the work of evaluating this poet or work remains; And needless to say that Marxist aesthetics have demonstrated their talent in this field - competing with the biggest thinkers of high culture
 vyakhya or moolyankan kii bhashaa nishchay hi bhautikwaadi bhi he or aitihaasik bhi, lekin kul milakar vah prabhutvshaalee parampara se bahut alag nahin he

 Chemically, this salt is a compound of sodium and chlorine called sodium chloride
 potacium nitrate ek doosraa lavan he, jo nitric amla ke hydrogen aayan ko potacium hydroxide ke potacium aayan dwaara pratisthapit karne se banataa he
 The molecule of nitric acid contains only one hydrogen, which is replaced by potassium
 salphurik amla main pratisthapaneey hydrogen kii sankhya do he
 Hence, a salt called sodium sulfate is obtained when both hydrogen is replaced by sulfuric acid by sodium
 donon hi yogic lavan kehalaate hai
 The first is called normal salts and the second is acidic salts
 vividh amlon or vividh kshaaron ke sahyog se anek lavan bane hai
 Salts are formed in the following ways: dhaatuon par amlon kii kriya se, jaise yashad par salphurik amla kii kriya se zinc sulphate praapt hota he
 Potassium chloride is formed by the action of acids, or acidic anhydrides on bases and carbonates, such as hydrochloric acid on potassium hydroxide
 tatwon ke sidhe sanyog se, jaise sodium evam chlorine ke sidhe sampark se sodium chloride banataa he
 Potassium sulfate is formed by the combination of acidic oxides and base oxides, such as sulfur trioxide and potassium oxide
 kisi lavan kii ek dhaatu ko duusari dhaatu se visthapit karne se, jaise copper sulphate ko lohe ke sampark main laane se taanbe kaa sthaan loha le letaa he, jisase pheras sulphate banataa he
 Sodium hydrogen sulfate is formed by the reaction of a salt and a less volatile acid, such as the action of less volatile sulfuric acid on sodium chloride
 lavan par kshar kii kriya se, jaise ammonium chloride par potash kii kriya se potacium chloride banataa he
 Sodium zincate is formed by the interaction of two alkalis, such as zinc hydroxide over sodium hydroxide
 dhaatu evam ksharak kii paraspar kriya se, jaise zinc par potacium hydroxide kii kriya se potacium zinket banataa he
 By the decomposition between two salts, such as potassium chloride and sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and sodium chloride are formed
 is reeti se jal main viley do lavenon, jaise silver nitrate tathaa potacium chloride, ke ubhay apghaton se jal main aviley silver chloride tathaa jal main viley potacium nitrate praapt hote hai
 Generally, this method is particularly used in the recovery of insoluble salts in water

 Metal, or metallic, comes first and acid follows
 amlon ke angreji naam ke antim ansh ko hataakar usamen "oid", "ite", kaa "at" jodate hai
 The binary compounds add "eyed" to salts and "item" or "at" to triangulated salts
 sodium or hydrochloric amla ke lavan ko sodium hydrochloride, yaa sodium chloride bhi kehete hai
 Salts in triangulated salts, if acidic, add "items" to them, such as sodium sulfite, sodium phosphate, and if salts are normal, add et to it, such as sodium sulfate, calcium phosphate, etc
 duusare shabdon main jis amla ke ant main "as" hota he uskaa lavan ite or jis amla ke ant main "ek" hota he usamen at jodate hai, jaise salphuras amla kaa lavan sulphide or salphurik amla kaa lavan sulphate he
 Salts have been classified in many ways, such as on the properties and nature of salts, on the basis of composition of salts and on the behavior of their aqueous solutions
 ek vargeekaran ke anusaar lavan ko "normal lavan", "amleey lavan", yaa "kshar lavan" kehete hai
 This method of classification depends on whether all the hydrogen ions of the acid, or all the hydroxide ions of the base, have been substituted, or not
 is vargeekaran main amla tathaa ksharak ke sabhi hydrogen tathaa hydroxide yanon ke pratisthaapan se praapt honevaale lavan ko narmal lavan kaha jaataa he
 Due to the non-replacement of all ions of hydrogen, the salts that are obtained contain substitutional hydrogen ions and such salts are called acidic salts
 isi prakaar se hydroxide ke sabhi yanon kaa pratisthaapan na hone ke kaaran jo lavan praapt hote hai, unamem pratisthapaneey hydroxide kii vishesh upasthiti ke kaaran unhen ksharkeey lavan kaha jaataa he
 For example, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, etc
 are normal salts
 sodium hydrogen sulphate, sodium hydrogen phosphate aadi amleey lavan evam ksharkeey magnesium chloride, ksharkeey copper carbonate aadi ksharkeey lavan hai
 Another method of classifying salts is based on the characteristic of salts and the completeness of ionization
 is vargeekaran main ynikaran se keval ek amleey, athwa ek ksharkeey, athwa ek ek donon ke mulak pradaan karanevaale lavan ko saral lavan kaha jaataa he
 For example, sodium chloride, sodium hydrogen carbonate, etc
 are simple salts
 aanvik anupaat main do sadrush lavenon ke sanyukt lavan ko is vargeekaran ke anusaar dwik yaa dwiangi lavan kaha jaataa he, jaise potacium chloride tathaa magnesium chloride ke sanyukt lavan ko dwik lavan kaha jaataa he
 The salts formed by the addition of special types of dual salts and more than two similar salts are called alum, or alum
 potacium sulphate, aluminium sulphate tathaa crystalia jal ke sanyog se nirmit lavan ko potash-fitkaree, yaa potash ailam-kaha jaataa he
 In the presence of more than one base or acidic element in a salt, such salts are called mixed salts, such as sodium potassium sulfate
 sankar lavan saamaanya dwik lavan ke sadrush hote hai, parantu vilyan main inkaa vyavhaar dwik lavan se bhinn hota he, kyonki inke ynan kii reeti bhinn hoti he
 Potassium ferrocyanide and potassium dichromate are hybrid salts
 saamanyat: normal lavan ke vilyan udasin hote hai, par anek normal lavan ke vilyan amleey athwa kshareey bhi hote hai
 This effect of a solution of a normal salt is produced as a result of the action of the ion of the salt with water
 is kriya ko jal apghaton kaha jaataa he
 On dissolving sodium cyanide salts in water, the solution undergoes water decomposition, as a result of which sodium hydroxide and hydrogen cyanide are formed in the solution and since sodium hydroxide is a fast base, the salt solution is alkaline
 ammonium chloride lavan kaa jaleey vilyan jal apghaton kriya ke kaaran amleey hota he
 Due to the development in the general theory of acid and alkali in modern times, the knowledge of salts has expanded a lot
 is disha main bronsted naamak vaigyanik kaa siddhant atyant mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 In this theory, more emphasis has been laid on the process of acid and alkali than the end product of salt

 The difference of subluxation is physically expressed in the lower self
 shreshthata or tiraskaar, sharir sidhaa or ucch sir pakad
 Licensed clearance: Goffman removes the scene from their surroundings as the women in the advertisements are often portrayed, suggesting they either physically turn away from the scene or appear lost in thought

 yah yahan seemaa kaa kaam karata he or china-nepal seemaa par mukhya himalayan jalsambar vibhajit hokar dono taraf bahata he
 In 1808, the British started the Great Trigonometric Survey of India to determine the highest mountains of the world
 dakshini bharat se shuru kar, survey team uttar kii ore badi, jo vishaal 500 kigra kaa vikonman kaa istemaal karte the jisase sambhavat: sahi maap liya ja sake
 They reached the mountains near the Himalayas in 1830, but Nepal was reluctant to let the British enter the country because Nepal feared political and possible invasion
 sarweyre dwaara kai anurodh kiye gayi par nepal ne saare anurodh thukraa diye
 The British were forced to continue observation from the Terai, an area south of Nepal that is parallel to the Himalayas
 tej barsha or malaria ke kaaran tarai main sthiti bahut kathin thi: teen survey adhikari malaria ke kaaran maare gayi jabaki kharaab swasthya ke kaaran do ko avkaash mil gaya
 Nevertheless, in 1847, the British were compelled and began to observe in detail the Himalayan peaks from the observation station to 240 km
 mausam ne saal ke ant main kaam ko teen mahine tak roke rakhaa
 In November 1847, the British Surveyor General Andrew Waugh of India made a number of observations from the Sawaipur station which is situated at the eastern end of the Himalayas
 us samay kanchanajangha ko vishwa ki sabase unchi chotii maani gai or usne ruchipurvak note kiya ki, is ke peeche bhi lagbhag 230 kimi dur ek chotii he
 Jaune Armstrong, who was a co-officer of Vogue, also saw this peak in the far west from a place he called the peak 'B'
 vaug ne baad main likhaa ki avlokan darshata he ki chotii ‘bi’ kanchanajangha se unchaa tha, lekin avlokan bahut dur se hua tha, satyaapan ke liye najadik se avlokan karnaa jaruri he
 In the coming year, Vogue sent a survey officer to observe peak 'B' in the Terai from the viewpoint, but the clouds stopped all efforts
 san 1849 main vaug ne vah kshetra james nicholson ko saunp diya
 Nicholson produced two observations from Girol 190 km away
 nicholson tab apane saath bada vikonman laayaa or purab kii ore ghuma diya, paanch alag sthanon se nicholson ne chotii ke sabase najadik 174 kimi dur se 30 se bhi adhik avlokan praapt kiye
 Nicholson went back to Patna, the Ganges River, to do some calculations based on his observations
 patna main uske kachche hisaab ne chotii ‘bi’ ki ausat oonchaai 9,200 me diya, lekin yah prakaash apvartan nahin samajha jaataa he, jo oonchaai ko galat bayaan karata he
 The number was clearly shown, although that peak was higher than 'B' Kanchenjunga
 yadhyapi, nicholson ko malaria ho gaya or use ghar laut jane ke liye vivash kiya gaya, hisaab-kitaab khatm nahin ho paaya
 Michael Hennessy, a subsidiary of Vogue, began assigning peaks based on Roman numbers, gave Kanchenjunga the IX name, and Choti 'B' the name XV
 san 1852 may survey kaa kendra dehradun main laayaa gaya, ek bhartiya ganitagya radhanath sikadar or bengal ke surveykshak ne nicholson ke naap par aadhaarit trikoshmetiya hisaab-kitaab kaa prayog kar pehali baar vishwa ke sabase unchi chotii kaa naam ek purv pramukh ke naam par everest diya, satyaapan karne ke liye baar-baar hisaab-kitaab hota rahaa or iskaa karyalayi udghosh, ki XV sabase unchaa he, kai saalon tak let ho gaya
 Vogue started work on Nicholas' data in 1854 and worked with his staff for nearly two years at vast distances over the years of calculations, transactions of light refraction, air pressure, observation
 san 1856 ke march main usne patr ke madhyam se kalakatta main apane pratinidhi ko apni khoj kaa puri tarah se udghosh kar diya
 The height of Kanchenjunga was clearly stated to be 28,156 feet, while the height of XV was stated
 vaug ne XV ke bare main nishkarsh nikaala ki “adhik sambhav he ki yah vishwa main sabase unchaa he”
 The peak XV was calculated to be 29,000 feet high, but it was publicly reported as 29,002 feet
 29,000 ko anumaan lagaakar 'round' kiya gaya he is avadharana se bachane ke liye 2 feet adhik joda diya gaya tha

 According to Anushruti, the founder of this state was Kaundinya Brahmin whose name is found in a Sanskrit inscription there
 naveen shatabdi isvi main jayaverma tritiy kambuj kaa raja hua or usee ne lagbhag 860 isvi main angkorthom naamak apni rajdhani kii neenv daali
 The capital usually remained for 40 years and was built around 900 AD

 The frontier Thai people of the west were first under the Samar Kingdom of Kambuj but in the mid-14th century they began to attack Kambuj and repeatedly won and looted Angkorthom
 tab laachaar hokar khmeron ko apni vah rajdhani chhod deni padi
 Then gradually the flood of bamboo forests completely alienated the city from the civilized world and its power merged into darkness
 nagar bhi adhiktar tuutakar khandhar ho gaya
 In the late 19th century, a French scientist revived the city and its ruins after a five-day boat trip
 nagar tonle saanp naamak mahaan sarovar ke kinare uttar kii ore sadiyon se soya padaa tha jahaan paas hi, duusare tat par, vishaal mandiron ke bhagnavshesh khadey the

 All the Ramayana sculptures are inscribed on its walls
 is mandir ko dekhne se gyaat hota he ki videshon main jaakar bhi pravasi kalakaaron ne bhartiya kala ko jivit rakhaa tha
 It is evident from this that the worship of Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh and other gods was prevalent in Angkorthom which was the capital of Kambuj country
 in mandiron ke nirmaan main jis kala kaa anukaran hua he vah bhartiya gupt kala se prabhavit jaan padati he
 The Gupta art is reflected in the embellishments of Angkorwat's temples, archways and pinnacles

 It is known from one inscription that the founder of Yashodharpur, Naresh Yashovarma, was 'a hero like Arjuna and Bhima, a scholar like Sushruta and a master of craft, language, script and dance'
 usne angkorthom or angkorwat ke atirikt kambuj ke anek rajya sthanon main bhi ashram sthapit kiye jahaan ramayana, mahabharat, puraana tathaa anya bhartiya granthon kaa adhyayan adhyaapan hota tha

 After a few years of construction, the state of Champa looted this city
 uske uparant raja jayavarman-7 ne nagar ko kuch kilometre uttar main punarsthapit kiya
 In the 14th or 15th century, Theravada Buddhists took it under their control

 visphot ke kaaran om vahaan se dur girtaa he or ek car ke neeche aa jaataa he
 The owner of that car, Rajesh Kapoor is a famous actor who is taking his pregnant wife Lovely to the hospital for delivery

 Sandi comes in front of Mukesh in the form of Shanti
 mukesh sochataa he ki vah shanti kii aatma he or bhaybheet rahane lagata he
 But then one day Mukesh knows that this woman is someone else, not peace
 vah satark ho jaataa he
 Finally, Om and Mukesh scramble on the set
 om kahata he ki vah purvajanm main mukesh dwaara shanti kii hatya kaa gavaah tha
 Mukesh challenges him that no court will believe in the matter of previous birth
 tabhi shanti ke vesh main ek yuvati vahaan aakar kahati he ki set par lage jhumar ke thik neeche hatya kaa subut dabaa hua he-- uskaa sharir, jise mukesh ne jivit hi bhoomi ke neeche dafna diya tha
 She stops Om from attacking Mukesh

 Sandy enters the room with Pappu from the other side
 tab om ko samaj aata he ki subut kii baat bataane vaali sandy nahin, asli shantipriya kii aatma thi, jisane apane hatyare se badla le liya
 The soul of peace, seeing Om with compassion, smiles and disappears
