 achtmal editor web pej banane kaa software anuprayog he
 Although the text editor of a web page's HTML markup can be written by any text editor, specialized HTML editors can provide more convenience and additional functionality
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai HTML editor keval HTML ke saath hi kaam nahin karte balki siesas, exmel or javascript yaa isiemescript jaise sambandhit praudyogikiyon ke saath bhi kaam karte hai
 In some cases they manage remote web servers via FTP and communication with webdav and version management systems such as CVS or subversion
 HTML editor vibhinn roopon main hote hai: paathya bhaag, vastu or WYSIWYG editor
 Text editors are typically created for intended use with HTML for syntax highlighting
 templats, tulbaar or keyboard shortkat shighrata se aam achtmal tatwon or sanrachanaon ko jod dete hai
 Wizard tooltip prompts and auto completion can help with common tasks
 paath HTML editor main saamanytah yaa to bilt-in kaary athwa ekikaran ke saath bahya upkarnon ke liye kaaryon ke rup main strot or sanskaran niyantran, link kii jaanch, code, code swarupan safai or afatipi yaa web DAV ke apaloding dwaara pariyojna ke rup main sanrachana karata he
 The text editor needs to understand the user requirement of HTML and in any other web technologies the designer wishes to use CSS, javascript and server-side scripting languages
 kuch editor saadhaaran rangeen hiliting ke badale drushtigat rup se yojit mod main vastuon ke paath strot ke vaikalpik sampadan kii anumati dete hai lekin in modon main WYSIWYG mana nahin jaataa he
 Some WYSIWYG editors have the option to include the use of palette windows that edit text-based parameters of selected objects
 yah pelatt yaa to kshetron main prayek parameter ke liye sampadan karne kii anumati dete hai yaa paath windos chaynit object ke liye strot paath ke puure samooh ko sampadit karne kii anumati dete hai

 The WYSIWYG HTML editor provides an editing interface that resembles how a page is displayed in a web browser
 kuch editor, jaise ki ek browser extensions ke rup main jo web brouzar ke bheetar sampadan kii anumati dete hai
 Because the use of a WYSIWYG editor does not require any HTML knowledge, it can be easily started by an average computer user
 WYSIWYG drishy upyog hone vaale web brouzar par aadhaarit antahsthapit abhinyas ingine dwaara praapt hota he
 The layout engine can be extended to a great extent by editor developers to allow them to type, paste, erase, and delete content
 lakshya yah he ki, puure sampadan ke dauraan roopantarit parinaam ko upasthit karnaa chahie jo baad main vishesh web brouzar main dekha jayega
 Although the WYSIWYG editor can make web design faster and easier, many professionals still use text editors, despite the fact that most WYSIWYG editors have a hand-edit mode of HTML code
 web ko mul rup se drishy ke madhyam ke liye dizin nahin kiya gaya tha or lekhak abhinyas niyantran kaa or adhik prayaas kar sakate hai, jaise ki siesas, jo pramukh web brouzaron dwaara asantoshjanak dhang se samarthit he
 Because of this, codes are often generated by WYSIWYG editors to create designs that look like widely used desktop web browsers, often offering file size and compatibility with external web browsers
 yah swatah utpann kiye gaye code haath se sampadit or thik kiye ja sakate hai
 For more information on this topic, see Difficulties in achieving WYSIWYG below

 Here are several online WYSIWYG HTML editors, some of them are: HTML ek sanrachit markup bhashaa he
 There are some rules for how HTML must be written for the World Wide Web in conformity with W3C standards
 in niyamon ke paalan kaa matlab he ki sabhi prakaar ke banaae gaye computer ke web citon par yah sulabh he, vishesh prakaar ke sharir vaale evam viklang logon ke liye or mobile phone tathaa pidie jaise wireles upkarnon ke simit bandvidthon or screen ke aakaaron ko sakasham banaate hai
 Unfortunately most HTML documents on the web do not meet the requirements of the W3C standards
 Only 1 in 141 studies conform to the standard
 yahaan tak ki un vaakya rachana kii drushti se sahi dastavej bhi anaavashyak punrariti ke upyog ke kaaran aksham ho sakate hai yaa niyamon par aadhaarit hone se kuch varshon ke liye padaavnat kar die jate hai
 Recommendations on the use of CSS with the current W3C HTML were first formally revised and refined by the W3C in 1996
 dekhen, siesas XHTML W3C kaa vartmaan siesas sifarish or W3C kaa vartmaan HTML sifarish 
 This guideline emphasizes the separation of content from style
 ise puri site kii style kii jaankaree dene kaa laabh hota he, prayek prishth main doharaaya nahin jaataa, prayek HTML tatv main akele chhod diya jaataa he
 The WYSIWYG editor designer has always struggled with how to best present these concepts by confusing the underlying reality without confusing its users
 Modern WYSIWYG editors have all been successful to some extent, but none of them have been fully successful
 jaise bhi ho ek web pej banaaya gaya yaa sampadit kiya gaya, WYSIWYG dwaara yaa haathon se, adhik se adhik sambhavit pathakon or darshakon ke bich safalataa ke kram main, saath hi 'duniya bhar main' web ke mulya maan banaae rakhane ke liye or sabase mahatvapurn isamen vaid markup or code hona chahie
 It should not be considered ready for the World Wide Web until the HTML and CSS syntax is successfully validated by a valid W3C validated service or any other trusted option
 shaareerik, drushti env anya viklangon dwaara web prishthon kii abhigamyata ek acha vichaar hi nahin he balki aadhunik samaaj main web sarvavyaapak or mahatvapurn he env kanoon ke dwaara adhidesh bhi praapt he america main, americanyon ke saath viklaangata adhinium or britain main viklaangata bhedbhaav adhinium kii aavashyaktaa web citon par he
 Similar laws are already in place in many other countries or will be soon
 Making pages more accessible than legalizing pages is accessible; This is a condition but there are many other factors to be considered here
 acha web dizin, chaahe WYSIWYG upkaran kaa upyog kiya gaya ho yaa nahin in khaaton ko bhi lene kii jarurat hoti he
 Whatever software tools are used to design, create and maintain web pages, the inherent quality of HTML depends on the skill of the person working on this page
 HTML, siesas or anya screepting bhashaaon kii jaankaree ke saath in kshetron main vartmaan W3C siforeeshon ke saath hell-mail, WYSIWYG HTML ke saath yaa bina kisi bhi diziner ko ek behatar web pej utpaadan karne main madad karti he

 Poetry is the philosophy and science of poetry and literature
 yah kavyakritiyon ke vishleshan ke aadhaar par samay-samay par udbhavit siddhanton kii gyanrashi he
 The poetry and literature of literature and craft varies according to the prevailing circumstances; As a result, poetic principles have also been constantly changing
 bharat main bharat ke siddhanton se lekar aaj tak or pashchim main sucraat or uske shishy plato se lekar adhyatan "navalochana' tak ke siddhanton ke aitihaasik anushilan se yah baat saaf ho jaati he
 In India, poetic natakadi works are called 'lakshya Granth' and theoretical texts are called 'bhavishya Granth'
 ye lakshan granth sadaa lakshya granth ke pashchaadbhaavani tathaa anugami he or mahan kavi inaki li ko chunauti dete dekhe jate hai
 The old names for poetry are 'sahitya Shastra' and 'alankashastra' and after incorporating the wide creative volume of literature, it also came to be called 'samyastashastra'
 mulat: kavyashastreey chintan shabdakavy tathaa drishykavy ke hi sambandh main siddhant sthir karata dekha jaataa he
 Aristotle's "poetics" assesses the critical criterion of comedy, tragedy, and epic, and the Natyashastra of Bharata presents only the principles of review of metaphor or voyeurism
 bharat or pashchim main yah chintan i
pus
 teesri chauthi shatee se hi praudh rup main milane lagata he jo is baat kaa parichaayak he ki kavy ke vishay main vichaar vimarsh kai sadiyon pehle hi shuru ho chukaa tha
 Poetry is basically associated with the triple dimension - poetry, poetry, poetry
 jahaan tak natyarup kavy kaa sambandh he, kavyakarta ke saath usamen natya prayogkarta natadi kaa bhi samavesh ho jaataa he
 The attention of poetic thinkers has always been on all these aspects
 sabase pehla prashn jo kavi ke sambandh main uthta he, vah yah he ki kavi yaa kalakaar anya maanav, dharmopadeshak, darshanik, vaigyanik, raajnneetik vichaarak se kis baat main vishisht he or kyon khaas prakruti ke vyakti hi kavi yaa kalakaar ban pate hai? duusare shabdon main, kavitvsakti ke hetu kya he
 Socrates and Plato consider poetry to be a product of divine charge, not a reward for study and practice
 bharat ke kavyashastri kavyrachana main pratibha ko pradhan hetu maanate hue bhi iske saath vyutpatti or abhyaas ko bhi kam mahatv nahin dete
 Conservative critics do not consider talent only for poetic power
 udhar pashchim ke romentic vichaarak kalakriti kii mul prerana ekmaatr pratibha ko hi maanate hai
 Yet all the thinkers are unanimous that the poet is a uniquely talented person who through his talent originates new creation in the form of poetry
 doosraa mahatvapurn prashn he, kavita kaa prayojan kya he? akhir kavi kavita kyon karata he? is sambandh main chintakon ke do dal hai– paramparawaadi chintak kavy kaa lakshya yaa prayojan naitik upadesh kii pratishtha maanate hai
 Through poetry, the poet wants to establish some values, just like a religious preacher
 kintu fark yah he ki uski kriti shailicilp kii drushti se romantic or rasmay hone ke kaaran dharmagranthon yaa nitigranthon se vishisht ban jaati he
 The Romantic thinker does not accept this
 vah kavi ko upadeshak nahin maanata
 According to him, the poet is the creator, the creator, who is also distinct from Brahma
 vah apni sristi, apni kalakriti ke madhyam se hamaare saamne rakhata he
 In fact, he wants to express his feelings through poetry
 kavy or kuch nahin, uski samast anubhutiyon kaa sarabhat tatv or uske antas main umadte-ghumdate bhaavon kaa swat: baha hua pariwaah maatr he
 Nearly all the mismatches of East and West can be merged into these two camps
 kavy kaa sabase mahatvapurn paksh vah kriti he, jo hamaare samaksh chakshush, shravan tathaa bauddhik sannikarsh kaa madhyam banati he or is madhyam se vah hamaare man yaa sanvit ko prabhavit karti he
 Therefore, in poetic thinking, this is the main aspect whose thinkers of East and West have been crying over the last two and a half thousand years about many aspects
 sabase pehla sawaal jo kavy ke kathy ke vishay main uthta he, vah yah he ki kavy main varnit ghatnaayen aadi kahan tak vaigyanik satya se mail khaati hai
 It is generally accepted by all critics that poetry does not take the form of fact-telling system
 usamen jis satya kaa samudghaatan hota he, vah vaastavik satya na hokar sambhavya satya hota he
 On this basis, anti-poets declare the imagination of the poet as confusing or far from the truth
 plato ne to ise satya se duhara dur siddh kiya he
 The thinkers of India have not considered poetry to be an illusion, although at one place Bhatt Lollat has interpreted Rā मेंa Adi in the form of the Nats imitating Rāma etc
 in the play of the play, while interpreting the Rasasutra
 pashchim main idhar manovigyaan ke vikaas ke pariprekshya main kavyashastreey chintan ne bhrantivaale is paksh ko or adhik majboot kiya he
 It is said that art is just an illusion
 isi se miltaa julata ek or mat bhi he
 Art is nothing but hypnosis
 idhar nritatv vigyaan ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par bhi kavy kii sammohini shakti par jor diya jane laga he or yah mat prabal ho uthaa he ki kavy yaa kala main puraane aadim samaaj ke ojhaaon ke mantron kii tarah jaadui asar hota he 
 This question arises here, after all, whether this illusion, hypnosis or magical effect, if we want to borrow the words of the old scholars, the "miracle" of poetry is caused by what elements? Poetry is basically fixed in language
 bhashaa shabd or arth kaa sanshlisht rup he
 Hence, the first question that will arise is whether poetry is merely wordy or semantic
 hamaare yahan ye donon mat prachlit hai
 Thinkers like Bhamah, Kuntaka, Mammat consider the word and its combined element of meaning to be poetic, not just the word or only the meaning, because in poetry, the two cannot be separated from each other
 is mat ke anusaar kavy ko chamatkaarshali yaa sammohak banane ke liye shabd or arth donon kii romaniyata par kavi ko samaan bal dena hoga
 The second view places more emphasis on the word in the influence of poetry, that is, on the auditory side than on its intellectual side
 prasiddh sanskrit kavi panditraj jagannatha kaa yahi mat he
 This view seems to be of those who emphasize more on the rhythm of poetry, vocabulary, verses and Shravan Bimbavatta
 pashchim ke svachhndathawadi sameekshak, visheshat: france ke pratikwaadi kavi or aalochak, saaf kehete hai ki kavy arth yaa vichaar se nahin banataa balki shabdon se banataa he 
 If we compare this opinion with the meaningless Shabarajal mantras of the exorcists, then we will find that here also the meaning is not important, but the rhythm of the words, the tone of the chanting of the exorcist Ojha is said to influence the patient and do psychotherapy
 yahi paddati manovishleshnatmak upachaar kii bhi he
 Word and meaning have been considered of special importance in creating the effect of poetry, so it becomes imperative to consider the relation of word and meaning in poetic thinking
 shabd kaa apane paramparaagat arth se niyat sambandh hota he
 This relationship has been called Abhidha Vyapaar here
 kintu bhashaa main is vyapaar ke atirikt anya vyapaar bhi kaary karata dekha jaataa he, jahaan shabd apane niyat arth ko chhodkar usase sambhddha kisi duusare arth kii pratiti bhi kara saktaa he, jise lakshana vyapaar kehete hai
 Aristotle has also discussed both these trades of language in his famous treatise "rhetorics"
 kavyabhasha main vastut: shabd abhidhaparak na hokar lakshanik hote hai
 There is a greater emphasis on this matter here in the West and it was started by the romanticist poet and thinker Coleridge
 uske anusaar samast kavyabhasha lakshanik he
 Other modern poets like IA Richards, Empson etc
 have also accepted this view
 is mat ke anusaar kavy main upatt bimb, roopak, pratik or myth sabhi bhashaa kii lakshanik prakriyaayein hai or itnaa hi nahin, kavy kaa chandovidhan, lay or shabdashayya kaa prayojan bhi sarvatha lakshanik he
 Similar to this view we have here of the soundist poeticist who in euphemism, goes a step ahead of the symptom and envisages euphemism and considers all the elements of poetry as expressions of feeling or as a satire
 udhar vakroktivaadee kuntak bhi kavy main upatt shabd or arth ke vyapaar ko saadhaaran abhidha na maanakar vichitramidha yaa vakrokti kehete hai or is vakrokti kaa viniyog varna, pad, vaakya, arthprakaran, prabandh jaise kavyangon main nirdisht karte hai
 The basic foundation of this division of Kuntaka rests on the formalist theory of Vamana
 yah kavy kii sanghatana yaa sanrachana kaa vishleshan kar uske un angon ke sammohak tatv ko samudghaatit karti he jo kavy sunne yaa padhanevaale ko prabhavit karte hai
 This analysis is associated with grammar and philology on the one hand and on the other hand, with artistic thinking
 idhar america main jo sanrachnawadi paddati kii nai kavyasamiksha chal padi he, vah usee drushtikon ko lekar chali jiskaa sutarapaat sanskrit kaavyon ke vivechan ke sambandh main hamaare yahan apane-apane dhang se vaaman, aanandavardhan or kuntak kar chuke hai
 Given the extent of the essay, it is not possible to discuss all the ideas from time to time on different parts of poetry
 kavy ke mulat: do paksh hai
 One is the Katyapaksha, which we find in the particular type of content of the content and the inner sensation of artistic feeling or rasadi expressed from it
 doosraa he kavy kaa shailipaksh jisamen lay, chand, shabdachayan, gun or alankaar kii yojana kaa vivechan hota he
 These elements have been discussed in detail by thinkers of East and West
 kintu yahan itnaa samajha lenaa hoga ki kavy kii prabhavanviti samgr hoti he
 All these elements in their own way are seen to contribute to that overall effectiveness
 hamaare yahan alankaarawaadi or ritivaadee sameekshak is samgr prabhavanvitivaale mat ko nahin maanate
 They consider the beauty or miracle of poetry in the meaning of ornamentation or in specific designation
 kintu vakroktivaadee or dhvanivaadee prabhaav kii drushti se kavy kii samagrata ko lekar chalate hai, bhale hi vishleshan kii drushti se ve bhi uske tattat ansh kii mimasaa karte hon
 Traditional critics in the West similarly do not judge the totality of poetry in terms of influence, and in poetry it is seen to give importance to ornamentation, utterance, far-sighted imagination
 vahaan bhi isa kii duusari shatee main ek aisa chintak hua he jisane kavy kii is samagrata ke siddhant ko pratishthapit kiya tha
 This is the core of Longinus's sublime theory
 pashchim ke romentic kavi or aalochak bhi kavy kaa chamatkaar samagrata main hi maanate hai or kuch aisi hi dharna hindi ke chhayavaadi or chhayavadottar aalochakon kii he
 The various poetic theories like ornament, ritual, curvature, rasa, sound, justification, miracle that we had, are basically based on what part of the beauty of poetry
 inkaa vishesh vivechan yahan anaavashyak hoga
 The third element after the poet and the poet is the listener or reader of the poem and the spectator of the play which is called Sahridaya in the words of the soundist
 sahruday kaa arth he samaan hridayvaala vah vyakti jo kavyanushilan ke samay usamen tanmayeebhoot hokar kavi ke samaan hridayvaala ban jaae
 This similarity of his heart is also related to the specific character or heroine mentioned in the poem
 is samanhridayata ko sthapit karne ke liye bhatnayak ne saadhaaraneekaran vyapaar kii kalpana kii thi jise abhinavgupt ne bhi maan liya he
 According to these Raswadis of India, in the mind of Kavyanushilaka, the raga disguise form Raja and all the qualities of the child, and the liberation of truth causes the mind to experience relaxation
 abhinavgupt is sthiti ko yogiyon kii samadhisthiti ke samaan maanate hai
 No theory has emerged in the West to regard the soul of poetry as an element like rasa, but in the last century there has been a theory developed by the rise of Romanticism that the listener or reader of poetry has empathy or sympathy with the poet or poetical character
 Experiences, as we have with Shakespeare's Hamlet or Macbeth, and with the style's prominence
 apane yahan, rasadasha tak ham kaise pahonchte hai, iskaa apane dhang se manovaigyanik vishleshan abhinavgupt ke yahan miltaa he
 But it is just a structure
 abhi haal main hue manovigyaangat shodhon ke kaaran is paksh par adhik prakaash padaa he
 a special branch of psychology, in which physiology is studied by our neoplasms and how the hearing, visual, sparsion, olfactory and nasal images, or their imagination, affects our brain and how it stimulates our psyche It happens, discoveries have been made and are happening that affect the how, why and how of poetry and artwork on the poetic Is busy in its deliberations
 uparyukt vivechan se spasht hoga ki aaj kavyashastreey chintan kaa kshetra kitna vistrut ho gaya he
 On the one hand he touches the ends of grammar, philology, art, philosophy and rhetoric, on the other hand he is also associated with psychology and physiology
 itnaa hi nahin, jab ham kavy ke aitihaasik, saamaajik preranasroton kii ore bhi dhyaan dene lagate hai to kavyashastra kaa dayera or bad jaataa he or vah samajashaastra, itihaas tathaa raajnneetik chintan se bhi ja judata he
 This is why many poetics will be found in today's poetic thinking
 kuch aisi hai jo paramparawaadi purvi yaa pashchimi saanche main dhali hai, kuch pashchim ke svachhndathawadi, kalavaadi, dadavadi, bhavishyavaadee yaa astitvvaadi siddhanton se judi hai or kuch yaa to friid ke manovishleshanvaad athwa marks ke saamaajik yathartwaadee darshan se sambhddha hai
 Sanskrit litterateurs have given 'characteristics of poetry', some of which are as follows: amrutha basnet nepali chalchitr kshetrako ek charchit abhinetri hai

 1526 main, babar ne dilli ke sultaanon main aakhri sultan, ibrahim shah lodi, ko panipat ke pehle yuddh main haraaya
 To secure the establishment of his new kingdom, Babur faced a Rajput treaty in the Battle of Khanwa led by Rana Sanga of Chittor
 virodhiyon se kaaphi zyaada choti sena dwaara hasil kii gai, turk kii praarambhik sainya safaltaaon ko unki ekta, gatishiltaa, ghudsavaar dhanurdhariyon or topakhane ke istemaal main visheshta ke liye tehraaya gaya he
 Babur's son Humayun succeeded him in 1530, but Pashtun suffered major reverses at the hands of Sher Shah Suri and effectively defeated most of the new empire before moving from territorial state
 1540 se humayun ek nirvasit shaasha bane, 1554 main safawid darbar main pahunche jabaki abhi bhi kuch kile or chote kshetra unki sena dwaara niyantrit the
 But when Pashtun fell into disarray after Sher Shah Suri's death, Humayun returned with a mixed army, mobilized more troops and managed to reconquer Delhi in 1555
 humayun ne apni patni ke saath makaran ke khurdure ilaakon ko paar kiya, lekin yatra kii nishthurataa se bachaane ke liye apane shishu bete jilaluddin ko peeche chhod gaye
 Jalaluddin was better known as Akbar in later years
 ve sindh ke rajput shahar, amarkot main paidaa hue jahaan unke chachaa ascari ne unhen paala
 There he excelled in field sports, horse riding and hunting and learned the art of war
 tab punasrtthanshil humayun ne dilli ke aasapaas ke madhya pathaar par kabza kiya, lekin maheenon baad ek durghatana main unki mrityu ho gai, jisase ve daayre ko asthir or yuddh main chhod gaye
 On 14 February 1556, during a war against Sikandar Shah Suri for the throne of Delhi, Akbar succeeded his father
 unhone jald hi 21 yaa 22 kii umr main apni atharahavin jeet hasil kari
 He became known as Akbar
 vah ek budhimaan shaasha the, jo nishpaksh par kadai se kar nirdhaarit karte the
 He checked production in a certain area and applied to the residents a tax of 1 / 5 of their agricultural produce
 unhone ek kushal adhikarivarg kii sthapana kii or dharmik matbhed se sahishnushil the, jisase vijay praapt kiye gaye logon kaa pratirodh naram hua
 He aligned with the Rajputs and appointed Hindu generals and administrators
 umairids ke samraat akbar ke bete jahangir ne 1605-1627 ke bich samrajya par shashan kiya
 In October 1627, Shah Jahan, son of Emperor Jahangir of Umairids, succeeded the throne, where he inherited a vast and rich empire in India
 madhya-sadi main yah shaayad vishwa kaa sabase bada samrajya tha
 Shah Jahan started building the famous Taj Mahal in Agra which was built by the Persian architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori as a tomb for Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of Shah Jahan, who died while giving birth to his 14th child
 1700 tak yah samrajya vartmaan bharat ke pramukh bhaagon ke saath apni charam par pahunch chukaa tha, aurangzeb alamgir ke netritv ke tahat uttar purvi rajyon ke alaava, punjab kii sikh bhoomi, marathaon kii bhoomi, dakshin ke kshetra or afghanistan ke adhikansh kshetra unki jaagir the
 Aurangzeb was the last of the great Ottoman kings

 Between the mid-16th century and the end of the 17th century, the Mughal Empire was the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent
 1526 main sthapit, yah nammaatr 1857 tak bachaa rahaa, jab vah british raaj dwaara hataaya gaya
 This dynasty is sometimes known as Timurid dynasty because Babur was a descendant of Timur
 faraghna vaadi se aae ek turki muslim timurid sipahasaalar babar ne mogul rajvansh ko sthapit kiya
 He attacked parts of northern India and defeated the ruler of Delhi, Ibrahim Shah Lodhi in 1526 in the first battle of Panipat
 mogul samrajya ne uttari bharat ke shaskaon ke rup main dilli ke sultan kaa sthaan liya
 Over time, the kingdom established by Umer crossed the boundary of the Sultan of Delhi, eventually besieging a large part of India and earning the title of empire

 However, Sher Shah's untimely death and the military incompetence of his successors enabled Humayun to regain his throne in 1555
 haalaanki, kuch maheenon baad humayun kaa nidhan hua or unke 13 varshiya bete akbar ne gaddi hasil kari
 The largest part of Mughal expansion was accomplished during the reign of Akbar
 vartmaan bhartiya upmahadweep ke uttaradhikari jahangir, shahjahan or aurangzeb dwaara is samrajya ko agle sau saal ke liye pramukh shakti ke rup main banaaya rakhaa gaya tha
 The first six emperors, who enjoyed both "lawful" and "rail" powers, usually refer to him by just one name, a title that was adopted by each of the nobles upon his accession
 praasangik sheershak ke neeche suchi main mote aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 Akbar introduced certain important policies, such as religious liberalism, the inclusion of Hindus in the affairs of the empire and political alliances / marriage with the Hindu Rajput caste, which were innovative to their environment
 unhone sher shah suri kii kuch nitiyon ko bhi apanaaya tha, jaise kii apane prashasan main samrajya ko sarkaron main vibhajit karnaa
 These policies undoubtedly helped maintain power and the stability of the empire, were protected by two immediate successors, but were abandoned by Aurangzeb, who adopted a policy that had little place for religious tolerance
 iske alaava aurangzeb ne lagbhag apane puure jivan-vritti main deccan or dakshin bharat main apane daayre kaa vistaar karne kii koshish kii
 This enterprise drained the resources of the empire which aroused strong resistance within the Marathas, Sikhs of Punjab and Hindu Rajputs
 aurangzeb ke shasankaal ke baad, samrajya main giravat hui
 Beginning with Bahadur Zafar Shah I, the Mughal emperors declined in power and became fictitious chieftains, initially controlled by various diverse courtesans and later by several rising chieftains
 18 veen shatabdi main, is samrajya ne persia ke nadir shah or afghanistan ke ahamed shah abdali jaise hamalaavaron kaa lut ko saha, jinhone baar baar mogul rajdhani dilli main lutpaat kii
 The Marathas were defeated before the British got most of the territories of this empire in India
 1803 main, andhe or shaktiheen shah alam II ne aupchaarik rup se british east india company kaa sangrakshan sweekaar kiya
 The British government had started calling the already weak Mughals the "king of Delhi" rather than the "emperor of India", which was formally exercised in 1803, which led to the uneasy implication of the Indian King moving on from the British Emperor
 Avoided
 phir bhi, kuch dashakon ke baad, BEIC ne samraat ke nammaatr naukaron ke rup main or unke naam par, apane niyantran ke adheen kshetron main shashan jari rakhaa, 1827 main yah shishtachar bhi khatm ho gaya tha
 When some rebels of the Sepoy Mutiny announced their allegiance to Bahadur Zafar Shah II, a descendant of Shah Alam, the British decided to abolish this institution altogether
 unhone 1857 main antim mogul samraat ko pad se giraaya or unhen burma ke liye nirvasit kiya, jahaan 1862 main unki mrityu ho gai
 Thus came the end of the Mughal dynasty, which contributed an important chapter to the history of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan
 mogul samraaton ke bare main kuch mahatvapurn vivaran neeche sarinibaddh he: Akbar Shah II bhartiya upmahadweep ke liye mughalon kaa pramukh yogadan unki anuthi vaastukala thi
 Many great monuments including the Taj Mahal were built by the Muslim emperors during the Mughal period

 His successors, with little recollection of the Central Asian country for which they waited, took a less lively view of the subcontinent's culture and became quite self-sufficient
 unhone kai upmahadwipon ke lakshan or pratha ko avashoshit kiya
 The Mughal period saw the blending of the Indian, Iranian and Central Asian artistic, intellectual and literary traditions into a more fruitful one than others in India's history

 The word 'stereo' is derived from the Greek word stereos, meaning 'solid', and is related to the properties of chemical compounds that depend on the stereoscopic arrangement of the atoms of their molecule
 parmaanuon kii trivim vyavastha kaa sabase pramukh fal trivim samavyawata he
 Isomers are compounds that have the same molecule, but differ in some physical and chemical properties

 In 1908, Malus discovered the polarization of light by rotation, and three years later Arago discovered the crystal to be light-active
 1815 i
 main vio ne pataa lagaaya ki thoson ke saath-saath drav or gaisen bhi vilyan main prakashaskriy hoti hai
 Specific rotation - The specific rotation of a lightly active substance is represented by the equation, which is the specific rotation for wavelength l and t degrees of light, and a is the fraction of the rotation of light, from a tube 1 cm long
 The light was obtained by going through it and d per cubic cm of the light-activated object filled in the tube
 Is the concentration
 dahini ore ke ghurnan ko dhanatmak tathaa bain ore ke ghurnan ko rinatmak kehete hai
 The specific rotation is dependent on the light wave, length, temperature, solvent and concentration

 Shelley obtained tartaric acid from the tartar of grapes in 1768, and in 1819, Kestner found an acid derivative of the same composition and named it racemic acid
 1838 i
 main bio ne pataa lagaaya ki tarterik amla prakaashat: sakriy he or racemic amla prakaashat: niskriy he
 After the discovery of polarized light and photoreactivity, significant progress was made by Pastor in the principles of physiology
 paister ne pataa lagaaya ki tarterik or racemic amlon kaa sanghatan tathaa unka sanrachanasutra HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-COOH ek he, par unke bhautik gunon main bhinnata he
 Racimic acid is less soluble in water than tartaric acid, and tartaric acid and its salts are lightly active, but racemic acid and its salts are lightly inactive
 paister kii sabase vikhyath khoj racemic amla ke sodium or ammonium lavan par hui
 When this salt crystallizes at 22 degrees from water, its crystals are different from those of another racemet and have semipermeable panes

 This second type of crystal is called mirror reflection
 inako jab mishran se pruthak kiya gaya to iskaa jaleey vilyan vamavart tha
 The crystal of acid obtained from it was also in the form of mirror reflection of crystal of tartaric acid and the solution was also counterclockwise
 isliye is amla ko tarterik amla kaa doosraa rup samajha gaya
 Their crystals are asymmetric: yah paaya gaya ki keval ve hi crystal tathaa anu, jinke darpan pratibimb adhyaropit nahin hote, prakaashat: sakriy hote hai
 Such a structure is called asymmetric
 bahut se padaarth thos avasthaa main hi prakaashat: sakriy hote hai, jaise sphatik, sodium chloret aadi
 The first known, optically active substance is crystalline, whose crystals are of two types, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise
 ye donon crystal ek duusare ke darpan pratibimb hai or adhyaropit nahin hote
 Such pairs of crystals are called reflection forms
 sphatik ke galane par isaki sakriyata lupt ho jaati he
 Hence the photosynthetic activation of the crystal is due to its asymmetric crystal structure
 is varg ke padaarth prakaashat: sakriy tabhi tak rahete hai jab tak ve thos rup main hote hai or galane par, vashpikaran se tathaa vilyan main inaki sakriyata nasht ho jaati he
 Many compounds are also lightly active in solid, melting, gaseous or solution states, such as glucose, tartaric acid, etc
 inaki sakriyata yogic kii amamit aanvik sanrachana ke kaaran hoti he
 This molecule and its mirror image are called reflection forms, optical antithesis or optical isomers
 keval do baton ko chhodkar, ye rup bhautik gunon main ek se hote hai
 They give equal and opposite rotation with the same polarized light and have different absorption coefficients with other clockwise and counterclockwise circularly polarized light

 There may also be differences in physiologic activity, such as histidine being sweet and histidine tasteless; Nicotine is more toxic than nicotine
 san 1874 main waant hof or le bal ne carbonic yogicon kii prakaashat: samavyawata ke astitv kaa samaadhaan kiya
 Want Half considered that the four valency of carbon is directed towards the four ends of a trigon and the carbon atom is located in the middle of the tetrahedral
 is siddhant ke anusaar methen ke chaaron hydrogen parmaanu samaan honge, jise bhautik or rasinic kriyaaon dwaara siddh bhi kiya gaya
 Earlier in 1858 AD, it was believed that all the four valencies of carbon are in a plane and the carbon atom is at the center of this square
 CX4 anu main carbon kii chaaron sanyojaktaayen samaan hai or yah kalpana kii ja sakati he ki trivim main inkaa samamit vinyas he
 Thus three arrangements may be possible - planar, pyramidal and tetrahedral
 yadi anu ekataleey ho, to yogic c a b d e ke teen rup sambhav ho sakate hai
 If the molecule is pyramidi, six forms of this compound may be possible
 yadi anu chatushfalkeey he, to yogic c a b d e ke do rup hi sambhav honge or donon ek duusare ke darpan pratibimb honge
 In fact the compound c abde is obtained only in a couple image form, which confirms tetrahedron molecule structure
 jab carbon main sanyojit chaaron samooh bhinn-bhinn hote hai, tab aise carbon ko asamamit carbon kehete hai
 Photosensitively active organic compounds must have one, or more than one, asymmetric carbon atom
 asamamit carbon yogic ke c a b d e donon pratibimb rup jab Ca2 bd main badal jate hai, to keval ek hi prakaashat: niskriy padaarth praapt hota he, jaise dakshinavart or vamavart donon lactic amla avakrut hokar ek hi propionic amla dete hai
 This confirms tetrahedral carbon

 When all four atoms or groups associated with a carbon atom are one, this angle is certainly 109 degrees 28 minutes, as in methane, CH4, or carbon tetrachloride, ccl4
 lekin methilin chloride CH2 Cl2, main kone 112 degree paaya jaataa he, kyonki chlorine ke bade parmaanuon ke pratikarshi bal ke kaaran sanyojaktaa kone main adhik failaav sambhav he
 The main difference in isomers with an asymmetric carbon atom is in their optical activation
 donon pratibimb roopon ke ghurnan ke chihr main hi keval antar hota he
 Therefore, they are also known as antiquarianism
 lactic amla, CH3
CHOH
COOH, ke anu ke keval do hi prakaashat: sakriy samaavyavi hai, jo aapas main ek duusare ke darpan pratibimb hote hai
 These are called dectro - and levo - lactic acid
 baraabar anupaaton main donon roopon kaa mishran prakaashat: niskriy hota he, kyonki donon pratibimb roopon kaa ghurnan samaan tathaa disha vipareet hoti he
 Such molecules, homogeneous mixtures, which are externally repulsed and lightly inert, are called racemic metamorphs
 aise racemic yogicon ko r athwa dl- upsargon dwaara nideshit kiya jaataa he
 Thus a compound with an asymmetric carbon atom can be obtained in three forms
 in samaavyaviyon kii sambhaavna asamamit carbon parmaanu par hi nirbhar he
 Asymmetry of carbon disappears, both optical activation and isomerism disappear
 sakriy mailic amla ke donon roopon ke avakrut karne par niskriy saxinic amla, HOOC
CH2
CH2
COOH, praapt hota he
 As the number of asymmetric carbon atoms in compounds increases, the possibility of more isomeric forms increases
 saadhaaran dasha main ek asamamit yogic ke, jisamen sankhya da asamamit carbon parmaanu hon, prakaashat: sakriy samaavayavon kii sankhya 2n ho sakati he or 2n-1 pratibimb rooponnau ke jode, arthath 2n racemic rup honge
 Compounds having two different asymmetric carbon atoms have the capacity of 2 x 2 i
e
 four forms
 inamen do jode honge or prati jode main ek duusare ke samaan or vipareet chihravaale ghurnan honge
 There will also be two racemic forms from both pairs
 is prakaar ke udhaaharan cinemic acid dibromide, C6H5
 c h Br
 chbr
 COOH, he, jo chaar prakaashat: sakriy roopon tathaa do racemic roopon main prapya he
 Compounds, both of which have the same asymmetric carbon atoms, are found in three configurations, with two optically active reflection forms, and the third intermittently inactive and cannot have differentiated active forms
 inke alaava donon sakriy roopon se ek racemic rup bhi utpann hota he
 The substance directed by the number 3
 is apparently inactive
 yadhyapi isamen do sakriy carbon hai, tathaapi ve ek-duusare ko prabhaavaheen karte hai, kyonki unka ghurnan samaan or vipareet he
 This intermittent molecule is called i or meso form
 niskriy tathaa avibhedit rup un yogicon main sambhav nahin he jinamein ek hi asamamit carbon parmaanu ho
 It differs from racemic forms, which can be distinguished from their photosynthetic forms
 is prakaar kaa sabase uttam udhaaharan diahydrosxinic amla he, jisamen do samaan asamamit carbon hai or jiskaa aitihaasik drushti se bahut mahatv he
 According to the theory, it is obtained from the same mixture of forms southward, counterclockwise and meso-tartaric acid
 dakshinvart or vamavart prakaashat: prativinyasi hai tathaa meso or racemic niskriy hai
 Their structures can be shown as follows: ek jode pratirupon ke baraabar mishran ko racemic rup kehete hai
 This form can occur for the following reasons: baraabar maatra main donon pratirupon ko milaane se
 Synthesis of asymmetric compounds gives a racemic form
 ek prakaashat: sakriy yogic ko racemic rup main parivartan karne kii kriya ko rapeemikaran kehete hai
 Often the + and - forms of compounds can be inhibited by the effects of heat, light and chemical reagents
 parivartan kii kriya yogic or abhikarmakon ke upar nirbhar karti he
 Some compounds are so easy and rapid that they cannot be obtained in an active form
 kuch thode se aise yogic hai jo resimikrut nahin hote
 Differentiation is the action whereby both its reflection forms are separated by a racemic transformation
 vastav main inkaa maatraatmak pruthakkaran bahut hi kam hota he or kuch main to keval ek hi praturup kii prapti hoti he
 Some methods of differentiation are as follows: yantric pruthakkaran - paister ne us vidhi kaa pataa lagaaya jiske anusaar donon pratirupon ke crystal alag alag hote hai or ve haathon se alag kiye ja sakate hai
 Pastor gave sodium ammonium tartrate at 28 degrees Celsius
 By crystallizing, both types of crystals were separated by tongs
 is vidhi kaa upyog bada simit he
 Desiccated Crystallon by Insertion - When a crystal of a reflection form is added to an over saturated solution of a racemic mixture, it is first a crystal of the same reflection form and thus a separation of that form can occur
 jivaracinic vibhedan - kuch jeevanu yaa faphund jab kisi racemic ke tanu vilyan par ugaae jate hai, tab ye ek pratibimb rup ko duusare kii apeksha shighrata se nasht karte hai
 Thus a reflection form can be obtained after a specified time
 penicellium glukam jab racemic ammonium tarteret ke vilyan par ugaaya jaataa he, to pehle dectro rup nasht ho jaataa he or livo batch jaataa he
 Chemical Differentiation - This method is the best
 isamen racemic yogic ke pratibimb roopon ko kisi prakaashat: sakriy yogic se upachaarit karte hai, taaki ve paraspar milakar aise yogic bane jinka pruthakkaran saralata se kiya ja sake
 The salts that will be formed by treating the acidic acid with a lightly active base, some of the salts will be + acids and + bases and some salts - acids and + bases
 inke gunon main vibhinnata rah sakati he, jinase ve crystalan dwaara pruthak kiye ja sakate hai
 Selective absorption - Selective absorption of photosensitively active substances can occur by a particular optically active absorber
 anek rasayanagyon ne iske dwaara vibhedan sampann kiya he
 The clockwise and counterclockwise reflection forms were previously directed by the Dactro and Levo prefixes, respectively
 isi bhanti dectry tarterik or livo tarterik amla kaha jaataa tha
 Wanthoff has used the + and - signs to denote the configuration of asymmetric carbon
 baad main fisher ne prastaav kiya ki d or l upsargon kaa prayog unki vinyas sthiti ke liye kiya jaae or inkaa prayog ghurnan kii disha ke liye na kiya jaae
 The sign of rotation of an optically active substance can often be reversed by changes in the experimental condition, and likewise the sign of their kinetics, whose configuration is the same, can also be opposite to the direction of rotation, such as counterclockwise lactic acid salts
 And esters are clockwise and counterclockwise of lactic acid
 in sab kaarnon se vichaar kiya gaya ki prakaashat: sakriy padaarth ke liye aise chihn kaa upyog kiya jaae jo sidhe vinyas kii sthiti kaa bodh karaae or yah chihn uske ghurnan disha ke chihn se swatantra ho
 Glyceraldehyde, which has an asymmetric carbon atom, is obtainable in two reflection forms and according to a voluntary determination that the clockwise form shows that the hydroxyl, -OH, carbon of the group is on the right and the hydrogen atom is on the right side
 chatushfalkeey carbon kii vyavastha ke anusaar hydrogen or hydroxil samooh prishth kii sataha se upar he tathaa -CHO or -CH2OH samooh prishth kii sataha se neeche
 This configuration of glyceraldehyde is called D
 prachlit reeti ke anusaar padi rekha dwaara sanyojit samooh prishth kii sataha se upar he
 Like this, there are signs of its state of reflection
 is D- glissraldihide ke pramanik vinyas se sambandhit vinyas D-shrenee ke anrtgat aate hai, arthath ve yogic, jo D- glissraldihide se praapt ho sakate hai, yaa rasinic kriya se D- glissraldihide main parivartit kiye ja sakate hai, D-shrenee main aate hai
 In this way, glyceraldehyde has the full name d glyceraldehyde and l glyceraldehyde
 or isaki ghurnan disha kaa sanket karte hai
 Their aldehyde group can be converted to the next homogeneous - CHOH - CHO and will give each glyceraldehyde two forms as it has an asymmetric carbon
 carbon yogicon main jab ek samooh duusare samooh dwaara pratisthapit hota he, tab yah samajha jaataa he ki pratisthaapak hataae hue samooh kaa sthaan letaa he
 If a lightly active compound changes from a simple substitution reaction to a b compound, their configurations are one
 yah satya he, par kabhi-kabhi pratisthaapan ke saath saath vinyas main parivartan bhi ho jaataa he
 This configuration change is called the optical inversion, or the Walden inversion by the name of the inventor Walden
