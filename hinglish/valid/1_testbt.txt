 At the time of the attack, our soldiers will be equipped with information technology, then why do we not know how these Naxalites who attacked the soldiers become so successful

 Don't you find it frightening, soldiers have been under attack for so many years, we and you have been talking the same things for so many years

 How did they get so much time? adhikariyon ke in bayanon ke baad bhi kai baar lagata he ki ghatana ke bare main sahi-sahi andaaza nahin mil rahaa he
 Is it so easy to surround 100 armed soldiers? 25 javaanon kii maut hui he
 It is being claimed that some Naxalites have also been killed, why some Naxalites were killed when they came in the number of 300, but there is one thing, CRPF soldiers also saved 40 people engaged in road construction work
 
 unki bahaduree kaa ye paksh bhi kam shandaar nahin he
 Martyrdom will not go in vain, everything ends at this, it does not begin why martyrdom took place

 This Bhojpuri song is sung by Khesari Lal Yadav and Pinki Singh together
 khesari laal yadav (khesari Lal Yadav) bharat ke prasiddh bhojpuri gayak or abhinayta hai
 Khesari's first success came from his Bhojpuri album 'mal Bhetai Mela'
 2012 main ai apni pehali film 'saajan chale sasuraal' se wo rato raat bhojpuri film jagat ke sitare ban gaye
 He uses his typical rustic language in his singing
 shuru se hi khesari laal lok gayak or saath hi wo ek achche nritak bhi hai
 In the beginning, he had to face many difficulties
 To become a Bhojpuri singer, it was very important to have money
 paison ko ikattha karne ke liye unhen litti chokha bechnaa padaa iske liye unhone apni force kii badi naukari chhod di
 a few years later he started singing in the Bhojpuri album
 jisase unhen uttar pradesh, bihar va jharkhand or jahaan bhojpuri boli jaati he, vahaan unke geeton ko beshumaar pyaar mila

 Patna Sahib seat is considered a stronghold of Kayastha votes
 is baar yahaan loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa or congress ke bich ladaai behad dilachasp hone vaali he, kyonki is seat se bhaajapa ke taraf se do baar saansad rah chuke shatrughna sinha ab congress ke taraf se ummidavaar banaaye gaye hai to vahiin bhaajapa ne is seat se apane kaddavar netaa ravishankar prasad ko khadaa kiya he
 But BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP RK Sinha's supporters are upset with Ravi Shankar Prasad being given a ticket from this seat
 darasal, aar ke sinha is seat se apane bete ko tikat dene kii maang kar rahe the, lekin bhaajapa kisi bhi surat main is seat ko ganvaana nahin chaahati he or kisi bade netaa ko is seat se pratyaashee bananaa chaahati thi
 For this reason, Ravi Shankar Prasad has been given a ticket from this seat
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki aar ke sinha ke samarthakon kii naaraazgi ke kaaran ravishankar prasad ko kadi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he, jiskaa phayda congress ko mil saktaa he
 Although according to caste equations, the Congress is expected to benefit from Patna Sahib seat, but Shatrughan Sinha often used to cause controversies in the BJP with his statements, but now he has started it in the Congress as well
 unka ye vivaadit bayaan congress ke gale kii fans ban saktaa he
 Recently, referring to Mohammad Ali Jinnah at a rally in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, Sinha said that "congress family from Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, from Mohammad Ali Jinnah to Jawaharlal Nehru, There is a party ranging from Indira Gandhi to Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 bharat kii aazaadee or vikaas main in sabhi kaa yogadan he
 That is why i have come to the Congress party ''
 halanki baad main is vivaadit bayaan par tool pakadta dekh, sinha ko is par safai deni padi
 Sinha said that "I took Jinnah's name in one stream
" meri jubaan phisal gai
 Actually i wanted to name Maulana Abul Kalam ''
 ab bhale hi shatrughna ne apni safai de di ho, lekin is vaakye ne unhen phir vivaadon main laa diya he
 The interesting thing about Patna Sahib Lok Sabha seat is that this seat has been dominated by BJP and BJP has also occupied Kayastha votes
 lekin is baar masalaa kuch or he
 According to the caste equation, Shatrughan Sinha is expected to benefit from the Kayastha vote as well as the Muslim and Dalit votes
 kyonki shatrughna sinha ab congress kaa cheharaa he or congress shuru se hi muslim or dalit voton par send maarane main kaamyaab rahi he
 At the same time, BJP candidate Ravi Shankar Prasad is contesting the Lok Sabha elections for the first time, in such a situation, there is a big challenge to handle Kayastha votes as well as traditional votes of BJP
 lekin kahin na kahin unako ek phayda bhi milane kii bhi ummid he, kyonki ravishankar prasad kii ginati bhaajapa ke kaddavar netaa main hoti he or vah kendriya mantri bhi he
 He also has connections with the people of Patna Sahib region and is considered a grassroots leader in this area
 jiskaa phayda unako milane kii ummid he
 Significantly, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, a total of 45
 33 fisadi voting hui thi, jisamen shatrughna sinha ko 24
 97 percent while Kunal Singh, Congress candidate 11
 31 fisadi vot mili the
 In 2009, after delimitation, two seats were created in Patna district
 isamen ek patilputra or duusari patna sahib seat
 Shatrughan Sinha has won the election battle twice from Patna Sahib seat
 pehali baar 2009 main patna sahib se film abhinayta or congress ummidavaar shekhar suman ko haraa shatrughna sinha loksabhaa pahunche the
 But the situation is different now
 do baar bhaajapa se saansad rahe shatrughna sinha apni hi party kii nitiyon par lagaataar hamalavar rahe
 Due to this rebellious attitude, BJP cut his ticket and made Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad his candidate
 patna sahib kii pramukh muddepatna sahib kaa sabase vyast ilaaka patna city, puure shahar kaa sabase bheed-bhaad kaa ilaaka he
 It is also the biggest market in Patna, there are many important issues like daily traffic jams, waterlogging during rainy days, encroachment and unemployment
 in kii vajah se yahaan ke logon ko kaaphi samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Both these parties are contesting the elections on the basis of these issues
 iske alaava sarkari aspataal or skool kii sthiti acchhee naa hona bhi yahaan kii ek pramukh mudda he
 The last phase elections are scheduled for May 19 in Patna Sahib and Pataliputra
 chunaav ke nattejey 23 may ko aaenge

 (input bhashaa se) (from input language) jabardast dhoomdhaam, dramebaaji, jumalebaji or ho hallaa ke saath modi ji ne bihar ke liye ek tathakthith 'special package' kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Just since then, the bjp's publicity machinery and its highly motivated workers have been working day and night to prove that a huge favor has been done on the basis of crores of rupees of government money
 kai aavantit kosh ko ikattha jodakar kaha ja rahaa he ki ye special package bihar kii tasviir hi badal kar rakh degaa
 The truth is that what is being promoted in the name of 'special' package is nothing but a hoax
 sava lakh karod kaa jo bada baari aankada diya gaya he, asal main vah puraani or vartmaan yojanaon kii sweekrut or bhavishya kii yojanaon ke liye sweekrut paise kaa mahaj jod bhar he
 Different ministries have already allocated these funds to Bihar at different times
 1
 1 in this so-called special package of 25 lakh crores
 08 lakh rupee yani 87 pratishat to vah he jo pehle se lagu puraani sarkari madad or yojanaon or vaadon ke tahat manzur kiye ja chuke hai
 Together, all these are trying to show how big the size of this so-called package is
 is package ko banane vaale darasal hamen ye bharosa dilaanaa chaahate hai ki ye package dher sari nayi-nayi yojanaon kaa guladasta he
 This will bring huge benefits to Bihar
 haalanki, gaur se dekhne par unke indaavon kaa sach saamne aa rahaa he
 This package will make available to Bihar an additional resource of Rs 10,368 crore
 ye paisa bhi kab milegaa, kaise milegaa, iskaa zikr hi kahin nahin kiya gaya he
 Therefore, even these 10,368 crore rupees do not have any special meaning for the state at the moment
 ab main sirf chaar moolbhoot sawaal poochne ja rahaa hum
 In my view, these questions will reveal the fact of this historical 'favor' done by the Central Government to the Bihar Government
 1
 What is the actual size of the package? The central government and their people want to explain that the total amount of this special package is 1
 25 lakh karod kii he
 But the larger this number appears, the bigger the package is
 dhokhaa he
 a very large part of this special package i
e
 1
 08 lakh karod rupaya vah hi paisa he jo san 2007 se 2015 ke bich bihar sarkaar ko vibhinn chaalu yojanaon or purv sweekrut vikaas kii yojanaon ke liye aavantit ho chukaa he
 Now this amount is being mislead by calling it a new fund or a new investment
 kaise? chaliye ek udahaaran detaa hoon – ye package daawa karata he ki 54,713 karod rupee haive, pulon or rail over brij ke nirmaan vagairah par kharch kiya jayega
 it's a good thing! But the central government is not saying here that out of these 37 projects worth Rs 47,553 crore have already been approved by the government
 matlab yah ki bache hue 7,160 karod rupee (54,713 karod rupee kii vishaal rakam kaa maatr 13 pratishat) hi sirf chaar sambhavit nayi pariyojnaon par kharch hoga
 2
 anya niveshkon (stakeholders) kii tulana main centre sarkaar kaa yogadan kitna he?ye package modiji kii khaas koshishon kaa nateeja bataaya ja rahaa he
 Then a big question becomes important here, how much will the central government contribute to other investors (stakeholders) in this additional amount of Rs 10,368 crore? In simple words, how much money will come from the coffers of the central government and how much money others will give
 yani kitna paisa bihar sarkaar va anya nijee or saarvajanik kshetra kii sansthaaon ko kharch karnaa hoga? is sambandh main kuch bhi nahin kaha gaya he
 With this announcement, the Central Government is deliberately giving false information
 3
 What is the time limit for getting the entire money of this package to the state government? If Bihar is really getting any benefit from this package, and they also assume that the central government is paying all the money for this package, then the question arises
 When will all the money be received? Will this money be received within a year? Get it in 5 years? Or will it be available in pieces in the coming years? Nowhere has there been any indication that by when will the promised money be made available to the state government or will it be invested in the state? The official note of the central government shows big things about the huge fund
 yahi nahin, ye lagu kab tak hongi, kaise hongi, bina is par roshni daalen tathyaheen tareeke se logon ke saamne paros di gai hai
 4
 rajya ko package kaa laabh milane kaa tarika kya hoga?ab tak hamane package ke aakaar, mukhya niveshak / niveshkon, or fund paane kii samay seemaa kii jaanch-padtaal kii
 Now the next logical question we have to ask the central government is, what will be the way to get this fund? Or how the central government will spend this money? Will she give it directly to the state government? Or will the money be spent through a third party? In this matter, why are we the general public kept in the dark? Nothing has been clarified about the modalities of fund disbursement or the benefit of the package to the state government
 inhen sab baton ko dekhte hue mujhe jaraa bhi achambhaa nahin ho rahaa he ki vitt mantralay is vishaal dhanrashi ko jutaney ke liye zaraa bhi haath paanv martha nahin dikh rahaa he
 Not only this, there is no visible wrinkle on the face of Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley about this amount
 ho bhi kyon? unhen is atirikt aavanton par kendriya bajet se ek bhi dhela kharch jo nahin karnaa he
 In the end, i have come to the same conclusion that this so-called special package for Bihar is being talked about, it is in fact a package of propaganda
 iske jariye bina kisi tathy ke shor-gul machaa, jabaran jhuthe utsaah kaa maahaul banaaya ja rahaa he or bihar ke logon ko bharamaaya ja rahaa he

 In the Sanatan Sanstha's Hindu Rashtra Conclave organized by Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, on the issue of Hindu Rashtra and Muslim it was said that there is no place for any other religion in India
 kanaklev main kaha gaya ki yahaan anya dharm ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 For us, religion comes before the constitution
 baaki sabhi logon ko waapas bheja janaa chahie or ham apane dharm ke liye apane haathon main hathiyaar bhi laa sakate hai
 Sadhvi Saraswati said these things in an open meeting in front of the media
 dharm ko lekar itani badi baat kahe jane ke baad bhi goa sarkaar dwaara conklev par koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 Because of the wavering attitude of the Goa government, such provocations were said on open platforms
 aapako yaad dilaa den ki sanathan sanstha ke sadasyon par goa or maharashtra main do bam visphot ke saath-saath dabholkar hatya kaa bhi aarope lagaaya gaya tha, lekin iske baavjood bhi aisi tippaniyon par koi dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 When Sadhvi Saraswati was questioned on the need for a Hindu nation, she said, "there is nothing in our mind about anyone, nor are we making any plans against any religion or any person
 lekin loktantr main ab hinduon ke liye kisi tarah kaa maanavadhikaar nahin bachaa he keval dharmanirpekshata bad rahi he
 "the Sadhvi continued," no Hindu priest and Maharaja would ask anyone to kill him for not letting us perform the Gayatri Mantra on a loud speaker
 lekin agar laud spikar dwaara ajaan par roak laga di jaae to dekhie kya hota he
 Hindus keep following
 ab seemaa paar ho chuki he or isliye hamen hindu raashtra kii jarurat he
 "hindus should take up arms," sadaswi said, "people have forgotten that our Gods and kings had taken up arms to protect themselves
 hinduon ko bhi apni aatmaraksha ke liye hathiyaar uthaa lene chahie kyonki bharat or hindootv khatre main he
 Our sisters and Gaumata are in danger
 "sarkaar kaam nahin kar rahisadhvi ne kaha, "ham kisi raajnneetik dal se nahin hai
 We believe in Raj Dharma and when Raj Dharma comes here then our government will come
 raaj dharm tab aayega jab gaumata surakshit hongi or ram mandir ban jayega or hindu khud ko surakshit mahasoos karenge
 It is not our government where Gaumata is killed
 ji haa, sarkaar kaam nahin kar rahi he
 Modi ji should clearly say that Ram temple should be constructed, cow slaughter should be stopped
 ise raajnneetik mudda bana diya gaya he

 trephic rule todane par court ne shaks par lagaaya 10,500 kaa jurmanamadhya pradesh main puraane hi act ke tahat kaate ja rahe logon ke chalanaane motor whical act 2019 ke praavdhaanon ke tahat badhaai gai jurmaana raashi par par madhya pradesh sarkaar kii alag raay ho sakati he lekin bhopal court ne ek alag hi faisla sunaaya he
 The Bhopal court on Wednesday imposed a fine of 10,500 on a person
 shaks sharaab pikar driving chalaa rahaa tha or helemat bhi nahin pahana tha
 Police on Tuesday seized the car of a man named Sunil Oswal
 ganesh mandir ke paas sunil oswaal ko sharaab pikar gaadi chalaate hue roka gaya tha
 In a report submitted to Chief Judicial Magistrate Vinod Kumar Patidar, the police wrote that the man was not only driving drunk but he neither had a driving license, nor was he wearing a helmet
 sijeem court ne apane buudhvaar ko die gaye apane aadesh main kaha ki sharaab pikar gaadi chalaane ke liye, bina license ke gaadi chalaane ke liye 5000 rupee shaks ko dene honge
 The court has imposed a fine of Rs 500 for not wearing a helmet
 is jurmaane par badlaav bhi ho saktaa he, kyonki madhya pradesh sarkaar ne nae motor whical act ko yathaavat lagu karne kii manjuuri abhi tak nahin di he
 The state government has stated that the hefty fine of the Motor Vehicle Act will not be fully implemented under the provisions of the new law
 sijeem court ne badha hua jurmaana lagaakar saaf kar diya he ki jurmaana nae niyamon ke hi mutabik lagaaya gaya he
 It is clear from the court's order that the government cannot interfere in the act, although the state government can change the challan
 rajya sarkaar ne apane gajet notification main likhaa he ki chaalaan kii raashi main tabdili karne kaa adhikaar he
 The amount of challan has been increased from Rs 100 to 500 for not wearing a helmet
 yah nae praavdhaanon ke tahat hi hua he
 However, the state has not shown any intention to implement all the provisions of the new Motor Vehicle Act
 madhya pradesh main police logon kaa chaalaan puraane niyamon ke hi mutabik kar rahi he, kyonki ab tak rajya sarkaar ne koi aupchaarik aadesh nahin jari kiya he
 In the BJP trying to regain the lost base of the party in Uttar Pradesh, its fast paced leader Uma Bharti has returned today
 pradesh vidhansabha kaa agle saal chunaav hona he
 Six years ago, in the presence of Uma Bharti, who was expelled from the party for indiscipline, party president Nitin Gadkari announced his return to BJP headquarters here, saying that 'umaji will play an important role in Uttar Pradesh's party campaign
 ’ unhone daawa kiya ki uma kii vaapasi kaa nirnay party ke bheetar aam sahmati se kiya gaya he
 With the arrival of Uma, BJP will get new energy in Uttar Pradesh
 uma ne ‘ghar vaapasi’ par prasannataa jataate hue kaha ki vah jahaaz ke aisi pakshi kii tarah mahasoos kar rahi hai jo us par waapas aane ke liye udaan bharta he
 He said, 'after staying out of the party for five-six years, i realized that only BJP is my edge and my destination
 in chah saalon main maine sabase bada sabak yah siikhaa ki rashtrabhakti or rashtrawaad ke liye bhaajapa kaa koi vikalp nahin he
 i want to forget the days of being out of the BJP for the last five years
 ’gadakari ne kaha, ‘uttarapradesh main mayawati ke ‘gundaraj’ or mulaayam singh ke ‘jangalraj’ kii vaapasi ko rokane ke liye bhaajapa rajya main uma ko mahatvapurn vikalp ke rup main pesh karegi
 'gadkari said,' Umaji will see the work of campaigning and charge of the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, based in Lucknow
 unki vaapasi se uttarapradesh main bhaajapa ko takat milegi
 Asked if some leaders including Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan were opposing Uma's return, the BJP president said that he discussed with all the state leaders and other party officials and now someone in the party on the issue There are no differences
 ek prashn ke uttar main unhone kaha ki uma ke desh ke kisi hisse main jane par koi roak nahin he lekin unka dhyaan vishesh taur par uttar pradesh par rahegaa kyonki vahaan vidhansabha chunaav hone hai or vahiin unka ganga abhiyaan bhi chal rahaa he
 At the same time, Uma said, 'after living in BJP for 16 years, i split from the party on some unpleasant issues
 main bhaajapa main patibaddhta ko lekar shaamil hui or patibaddhta ke kaaran hi alag hui
 But never abandoned ideology
 party se alag hone ke baad maine mahasoos kiya ki vaicharik patibaddhta ko aage badhaane ke liye bhaajapa ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 'he said that now there is nothing of past in his mind
 uttarapradesh ram or roti tathaa mandal evam kamandal kaa pradesh he or uttarapradesh main ram rajya sthapit karne ke party ke prayaas main apana purna sahyog dengi
 Gadkari said that Uma is running a holy Ganga campaign in Uttar Pradesh, in view of this, he has also been made the convenor of the Ganga cell of the party

 garmi kii abhi shuruyaat hi hui he or gujarat main pani kii killat ne logon kaa jeena mushkil kar diya he
 The situation in Tawa village of Chhota Udepur in Gujarat is such that people here stand in line for hours for water
 iske baavjood unhen kai baar puure din main ek boond bhi pani naseeb nahin hota he
 The surprising thing about this village is that the Sardar Sarovar dam on which the Narmada River is built and which quenches the thirst of more than half of Gujarat, the same Sardar Sarovar Dam is just 30 kilometers from this place
 ghanton line main khadey rahane vaale chota udepur ke tawa gaanv ke adivasee logon ke liye pani kii ek-ek boond bhi kaaphi keemtee he
 Small children of this village leave studies at the time of examination and stand in line for water with Gagar in their hands
 dilachasp baat ye he ki 1500 kii aabaadi vaali is gaanv main do bor hai, lekin garmi shuru hote hi pani kaa str itnaa itnaa neeche chalaa jaataa he ki puure din main sirf 15 se 20 minute hi borwell main pani aata he
 Apart from these 2 borewells, the village has no other source of water to drink
 aise main gaanv kii mahilaayein, bacchiyaan or yuva garmi ke dinon main donon borwell ke bich chakkar katate rahete hai
 There is some relief on getting water and the wait increases if it is not available
 pichley 15 din se, jab se garmi ne apana raudra rup dikhaanaa shuru kiya he, har koi pani ke liye line main lag jate hai
 Jaideep Rathwa, a resident of the village, says that the government has also built 27 different hand pumps and water tanks in the village of Tawa, but due to the government's indifference, till date there was no water
 ye gaanv unchai par sthit he jisaki vajah se garmiyon main pani kaa str kam ho jaataa he
 It is worth noting that the distance of Sardar Sarovar Dam, which is considered to be the door of life for Gujaratis, is just 30 km from this village
 narmada par bane is baandh ke itnaa najadik hone ke baad bhi tawa gaanv ke log pani kii ek-ek boond ke liye tadap rahe hai

 lekin kiski film ko zyada darshak dekhenge ye abhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Let us know that both these films are being released on 2800 to 3000 screens
 jahaan ADHM zyada multiplex par he vahiin shivaay ko single screen theatre khub mili hai
 Who will loot at the box office on Diwali, 'shivaay' or 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil'

 While the film has so far earned 50 crores by selling rights
 shivaay kaa bajet 105 karod kaa he jisamen 20 karod pramotion par kharch kiye gaye hai
 It has also earned 50 crores from the rights sale
 kya ranbir kapur ke liye terning point sabit hogi unki agali film 'i dil he mushkil'haalanki pramotion ke maamle main 'e dil he mushkil' kaa paala baari dikh rahaa he
 Its lead characters are seen in every reality show these days

 This year a law has been enacted through the Government of Gujarat to clamp down on arbitrary fees of schools
 ab sarkaar ne ye faisla kiya he ki jo skool is kanoon ke tahat fees nahin kam karegaa unke khilaaf sarkaar sho moto lete hue notice jari karegi or 90 din ke bheetar kanoon kaa paalan nahin karne vaale skool kaa registration radd kar diya jayega
 After the law made by the Gujarat government regarding the fee rules this year, now the government is determined to strictly follow this law
 darasal, gujarat sarkaar ke jariye fees ko lekar aae din mil rahi abhibhavakon kii shikaayat ke baad ek kanoon banaaya gaya
 Under which any self finance school of Gujarat will get Rs
 15000 for primary education from this year
 , secondry ke liye 25000 ru
 And Rs 27000 for higher secondary
 se zyada nahin le saktaa
 By the way, after this law of the government, the land has been slipped from under their feet who were doing their own arbitrary over school fees
 skool main aae din hone vaale abhibhavakon or skool prashasan ke bich ke hangaame ke baad gujarat sarkaar ne is saal se kadaa rukh apanaate hue faisla kiya he ki jo skool court main bhi nahin gaye or sarkaar ke paas afidavit bhi nahin jamaa karaayaa
 Now the government will start proceedings against such schools from tomorrow
 sarkaar pehle aceskulon ko noticedegi or phir jurmaana vasuul kiya jayega
 However, if there is no action on the part of the school, then the registration of the school itself will be canceled
 ab yah dekhnaa kaaphi dilachasp hoga ki sarkaar kya aise skulon kii fees 15000 rupye karvaa paati he jo abhibhavakon se dedh se do lakh rupye sirf ek saal kaa lete hai
 However, the experts are assuming that elections are going to be held in Gujarat this year, in which way the government is also pressurizing the school to follow the law in a hurry
 bombai hai court kii aurangabad bench ne ek petishan par faisla sunaate hue akshay kumaar kii aane vaali film 'jolly elelbi2' ke 4 seen kaatane kaa aadesh diya he
 Along with this, the censor board will also change its rating for this film
 vahiin film kii relies isi hafte honi he
 In this case, the makers of 'jolly LLB 2' can knock the door of the Supreme Court
 'jolly elelbi 2' kii screening par rithik sang pahunche kai starsbata den ki bombai hoicourt kii aurangabad bench ne do emicas curi (adaalat kii madad karne vaale vakil) ko niyukt karte hue unhen akshay kumaar kii film jolly elelbi-2 dekhne ko kaha tha

 This report said that some scenes in 'jolly LLB 2' may tarnish the image of Indian Judicial

 Akshay's film 'jolly LLB 2' has been ordered by the High Court Bench to remove the scene of 'jolly LLB 2' which has been shown to be throwing a shoe, claiming it to be offensive in a legal case
 iske alaava, film mekars ko court main bahasabaaji vaale drishy ko bhi badalane ko kaha gaya he
 Where did it start? a lawyer named Ajay Kumar Waghmare had demanded removal of the word LLB from the film till the case was filed in the High Court and said that the scene should be removed from the film in which the lawyers are shown playing cards inside the court
 
 akshay kaa ye gaanaa sun 'baavaraa' ho jayega aapkaa majjay kumaar ne apni petishan main yah bhi kaha tha ki kanoon main freedom of expressant ke saath kuch ristriction bhi hai
 According to the Petition, the film presents a laughable image of those associated with the judiciary

 The BJP mission has gathered in Gujarat
 beete kareeb 40 din main piem modi kaa gujarat kaa yah doosraa daura he, jabaki 9 maheene main yah 8waan daura he
 Earlier, he did not come here for two years after becoming Prime Minister
 sutron ke mutabik-bijepi kheme main june main chunaav kii sugabugahat he, kyonki barish kii vajah se july-agast main chunaav nahin ho sakate
 However, the final decision will be taken by PM Narendra Modi
 ravivaar ko jo surat main piem narendra modi ne jo road sho kiya, isse bijepi maahaul banane kii koshish kar rahi he
 In fact, the BJP won here in the late 2015 local elections, although some seats were reduced, but the BJP lost badly in the Zilla Panchayat and Tehsil Panchayat
 iske baad patidaaron, daliton or obisi andolan bijepi ke gale kii fans ban gaya
 Now PM Modi feels that only by taking command himself will circumstances prevail
 duusare netaaon ke bharose nahin baith sakate
 The comments iske saath hi gujarat bijepi ke liye ahm hai kyonki haal hi main patidaar andolan or uske netaa hardik patel ne bjp's problems have increased and BJP has replaced Vijay Rupani as Chief Minister instead of Anandiben Patel
 surat main road sho ke bhi myne hai
 
 
 Actually, the Patidar movement started from Surat itself

 He arrived in Jamnagar district to inaugurate the Saurashtra Narmada Landing Irrigation Scheme, under which water of Narmada is to be transported to Saurashtra

 This means that before Gujarat har hisse main ja rahe hai kyonki 2019 ke aam chunaav se pehle griharajya main piem modi kii jeet or bijepi ke liye behad ahmiyat rakhti he
 With this, Gujarat is important for BJP because recently Patidar movement and its leader Hardik Patel bijepi kii mushkilen badhaai hai or bijepi ne anandiben patel kii jagah vijay rupani ko mukhyamantri banaaya he
 Road shows also have meaning in Surat
 
 
 darasal, surat se hi patidaar andolan shuru hua tha
 PM Modi inaugurated the Patidar Samaj Hospital
 ise patidaar samaaj se judane kii ek koshish ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Not only this, PM Modi has come to Gujarat many times for the last one year

 He has gone to Banaskantha and Somnath and now has come to Surat in South Gujarat
 yani vah chunaav se pehle gujarat ke Going in every part because PM Modi's victory in the home state before 2019 general election and is very important for BJP
 yaheen nahin kareeb pichley ek saal se piem modi kai baar gujarat aae hai
 He arrived in Jamnagar district to inaugurate the Saurashtra Narmada Landing Irrigation Scheme, under which water of Narmada is to be transported to Saurashtra
 vah banaaskantha or somnath ja chuke hai or ab south gujarat main surat main aae hai
 This means that before Gujarat har hisse main ja rahe hai kyonki 2019 ke aam chunaav se pehle griharajya main piem modi kii jeet or bijepi ke liye behad ahmiyat rakhti he

 Not one, many, many times

 The results of this seat have changed from election to election
 lekin pichley chunaav main yahaan se congress ne baaji maari thi or ye muqabla behad rochak rahaa tha
 BJP lost this seat by 162 votes and the seat became normal in 2012 and Congress's Poonam Parmar was the winner
 unhen 65210 vot mili
 While BJP candidate Vipul Patel, who contested against him, got 65048 votes
 yani congress pratyaashee mahaj 162 voton ke maamuli antar se chunaav jeet paae
 This is the reason why this time too BJP reposed faith in Vipul Patel and contested again

 On June 2, Sonia, keen to strengthen the party's position in the state, had handed over the new responsibility to the Muslim face Kaiser, replacing the President of the State Congress Committee Anil Sharma and AICC in-charge Jagdish Tytler
 duusari ore vaasanic ek dalit hai

 Mohammed Rafi Sahab, one of the best playback singers of Hindi cinema, left a distinct identity among his contemporary singers due to the sweetness of his voice and the abundance of range
 varsh 1949 main naushaad ke sangeet nirdesan main dulaari film main gaae geet 'suhaani raat dhal chuki' ke jariye vah safalataa kii unchaiyon par pahunch gaye or iske baad unhonen peeche mudakar nahi dekha
 On July 31, 1980, the great voice magician Mohammed Rafi suffered a heart attack and left the world
 lekin vah aaj bhi apane chaahane waalon ke dilon main pehle kii tarah hi jivit hai
 In the year 1999, when Salman Khan's' yearning and austere heart started sighing
 
 
 ' geet filmaaya gaya, to abhinayta kii nam ankhon ne jane kitnon ko rulaayaa
 Then the lovers felt the pain of love in the eyes of 'prem'
 yah vah daur tha, jab salmaan or aishwarya kaa prem paravaan par tha
 When time took a turn, the love of Bollywood's 'prem' changed in real life
 lekin apni mahila mitron ke kaaran sukhiryon main rahane vaale salmaan kii jindagi kaa ek daur yah bhi he jab bakaul salmaan vah transishan ke phej se guzar rahe hai
 From Pakistani model and actress Somi Ali, Sangeeta Bijlani and Aishwarya Rai to Salman's life, Katrina Kaif has knocked everyone
 dil har baar dhadkaa
 Chahat woke up every time, but over time, Salman's heart also brought an 'ah' which neither heard nor felt in the glare of the cinematic world
 yah sanyog hi he ki jindagi ne shuruyaat main jiske paimaane main jamkar prem parosa, aaj use chhodkar uski sabhi premicaayen kahin or hai
 She is either leading a happy married life or is absorbed in a love affair
 salmaan khan 27 disambar ko 50 saal ke ho jaaenge
 In Bollywood, he is still called Most Eligible Bachelor
 haalanki, afvaahon ko chhod den to ab unki dil kii gaadi philhal kahin rukati najar nahin aati he
 but
 
 
 
 Look at an interesting coincidence, Salman's so-called girlfriends who left him, or Salman who bye-byed another aspect of their lives today or to say that after Salman, 'other celebrity men' came into the lives of those women, except in private life Do not appear to be successful in professional life anywhere
 agar hue bhi to unki safalataa kii gaadi ab thakti or thamati najar aa rahi he
 So should we assume that the 'ah' that has come out of Salman's heart has become 'hi' to others
 yakeen nahin aata to khud hi pard lijie
 Frustrated 'dam' begin with Vivek Oberoi
 kyonki salmaan ke baad or abhishek bachchan se pehle aishwarya raay kii jindagi main vivek ne hi jameen talashne kii koshish kii thi
 The year was 2003
 vivek kaa kariyar un dinon ufaan par tha
 Meanwhile, Salman Khan and his so-called girlfriend Aishwarya Rai, everything was not going well between them
 vivek ne aishwarya raay kii ore dosti kaa haath badhaayaa
 Of course he challenged Salman
 kai tarah kii khabaren bhi ain, lekin baat rafa-dfa ho gai
 Aishwarya Rai neither became Vivek's friend nor anything else
 lekin is saare chakkar main vah villen kii tarah ubharkar aae or unki filmon ke box offis par flop hone kaa aisa silsilaa shuru hua ki vah aaj tak thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 In this affair, he is now being forced to play the role of Villain onscreen as well
 filmon main zyada tarjeeh milti nahin dekh vivake ab rupahale parde se gaayab hi ho gaye hai
 After 'tamasha' Aishwarya Rai of a rockstar, Katrina Kaif allegedly knocked Salman's life
 donon kii dosti ke khub charche the, haalanki donon ne kabhi bhi apane munh se rishton ko lekar kuch nahin kaha
 Salman's fans also felt that this will be an important part of Haseena Bhai's life
 lekin aisa ho na sakaa
 Salman's Katrina is now in Ranbir's arms
 ab takadir kaa khel dekhie, jab se ranbir ko katrina mili he, unki pichhali sabhi filmein besharm, roy, bombai velvet or tamaasha box offis par post ho chuki hai
 The career of this talented rising star of Bollywood is being burdened with flop films
 katrina khud bhi filmon main kuch khaas kamaal karti najar nahin aa rahi hai
 Abandoning Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan's name will also be included in this episode
 amitabh bachchan ne apane kariyar kii shuruyaat main saat flop filmein di
 Abhishek was also expected that his star would shine
 'yuva', 'guru' or 'banty or bubbly' ne kuch aas jagaai bhi, lekin vah ab 'dhooma siries' ke hi hokar rah gaye hai
 At the moment, Abhishek, who is unable to do anything special in the world of cinema, is enjoying the pleasure of team honor in Kabaddi field
 duusari ore, aishwarya raay ke 'jazbe' ko bhi cinema ke darshakon ne koi khaas tarjeeh nahin di
 There must have been some compulsions, of course Salman is left alone once again
 lekin shaayad bhai ne bashir badr kii in panktiyon par yakeen kar liya he ki'kuch to majaburiyaan rahi hongi, yun koi bevafa nahin hota'
 It is also worth noting that at this stage of age, Salman is no longer seen to be tied in a relationship on the one hand, while he is not even keen for it
 ek paksh yah bhihaalanki, salmaan khan ke jivan kaa ek paksh yah bhi he ki vah jis heroin ko bhi film main brake dete hai yaa jo bhi heroin unke saath apana kariyar shuru karti he uskaa kariyar paravaan nahin chadh paata
 These include Bhagyashree, Nagma, Sneha Ullal to Zarine Khan
 isi tarah hindi cinema jagat main ab yah manyata bhi banati ja rahi he ki unki tathakthith purv garlfrends se dosti karne vaale logon kii kismat bhi box offis par jor maarna band kar detii he
 While in between all these brothers are busy with their 'sultan' and 'bigg Boss'
 unki filmein record bana rahi hai or dushman ab 'dost' ho chuke hai
 Now, who will believe in the rumors and rumors, then Salman Khan's name is now being linked with Lulia
 unki kathith nazdikiyon kii charchaa aae din hoti rahati he
 By the way, Bhaijaan does not seem to be giving any clue towards this at the moment, so it will be interesting to see who gets his heart on this beautiful brother and who wants to screw with his luck
 vaise, itnaa kuch sochane, samajhane or gadhane ke baad itnaa tay he ki salmaan se saavdhaan rahanaa hi thik he
 Preparations are on to start the Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand, while the bad weather is coming in the way
 pahaado par is baar april ke maheene main bhi lagaataar ruk rukkar barish ho rahi he
 This time 25 Western Disturbances have arrived since January
 or is vajah se himalay ke zyaadaatar ilaakon main barish or barfbaari saamaanya se zyada hui he
 This changing trend of the weather is also affecting the journey of Char Dham
 halaat ye he ki kedarnath ke ilaake main barfbaari kaa silsilaa bana hua he or upree ilaakon main barf kii moti chadar jami hui he
 According to the Meteorological Department, the process of rain in the mountains is going to start again in the month of May
 30 april ko ek western disterbence uttar bharat main daakhil hone ja rahaa he jiske chalate 1 may se lekar 4 may tak jammu-kashmir se lekar uttarakhand ke tamaam pahari ilaakon main madhyam darje kii barish hone kii sambhaavna he
 The bad weather is also affecting tourism
 uttarakhand tourism kii dipti diarector punam chand kaa kahana he ki chaar dham kii oonchai takreeban 3000 meter se upar kii he lihaaja in ilaakon main halki se madhyam barish bhi kanpakanpi chhudaa sakati he
 Whether it is Badrinath or Kedarnath, snow is frozen in both the places, so travelers going here will have to take special care
 bhale hi uttarakhand tourism ke adhikari ye kah rahe hon ki kedarnath main acha najaara dekhne ko milegaa lekin chaar dham yatra kii jab bhi baat hoti he to logon ke jehan main pichley saal kedarnath dham main hui baari tabaahi kaa manjar kaundh jaataa he
 Therefore, there is a doubt about the weather
 gauratlab he ki is baar gangotri or yamunotri dham ke kapaat 2 may ko khulenge
 The doors of Kedarnath Dham are opening on 4 May, while the doors of Badrinath Dham will open on 5 May
 desh kii chaar loksabhaa or 10 vidhansabha siton par upachunaav ke liye jari voting ke bich kuch ilaakon main EVM main gadabadi kii baat saamne ai he
 There has been an uproar since
 jahaan ek ore samaajawaadee party or areldi ne sajeesh ke tahat EVM ko kharaab karne kaa aarope lagaaya he, to duusari taraf shivasena ne iske liye bijepi ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Apart from this, the NCP also raised the question as to why EVM was installed from Gujarat? In an interaction with a TV channel, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that evms have been reported from 50 to 60 booths in Palghar district
 pehle booth capcharing hoti thi or logon ko booth jane se rokane ke liye daraaya-dhamkaaya jaataa tha, lekin ab EVM kii chaabi hi bijepi ke paas aa gai he
 In order to reduce the voting percentage in Palghar, Shiv Sena's stronghold, deliberately malfunctioning machines have been installed
 vahiin, samaajawaadee party nekairana or nurpur upachunaavamein sajeesh ke tahat iviem kharaab karne kaa aarope lagaate hue chunaav ayog se shikaayat kii he
 SP has alleged that BJP has tampered with evms for fear of defeat
 sapa ne chunaav ayog se shikaayat karte hue donon hi jagah chunaav radd karaane kii bhi maang kii he
 RLD candidate from Kairana Lok Sabha Tabassum Hasan made a big charge, saying, 'my election is being influenced
 sthaneey prashasan dabaav main kaam kar rahaa he
