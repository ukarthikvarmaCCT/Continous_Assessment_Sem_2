 First the Aam Aadmi Party and now the BJP have also announced their candidate selection process and started demanding applications from the candidates
 anya sabhi partiyaan bhi yuvaaon ko mauka dene kii baaten karne lagi hai
 'the issue will be based on the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections', the national spokesperson said,' BJP has said that people above 60 years of age will not be made candidates
 hamane pehle bhi kaha he ki aagaamee nigam chunaavon ko mudda-aadhaarit bananaa swaraj india kii pehali safalataa hogi
 We are committed to work to make the capital Delhi garbage free, epidemic free and pollution free
 isi pariklpana ke saath hamane saaf dil, saaf dilli kaa naaraa diya he
 'the party is participating in elections for the first time, it is important that Swaraj is participating in electoral politics for the first time through the Indian Nigam elections
 chunaav main ummidavaar chayan se lekar chunavi agenda set karne main party vaikalpik raajnneeti ke kai prayog kar rahi he
 Swaraj India is the first party to make "environment and cleanliness" its election agenda

 At least the cowardly attack on school children in Peshawar is telling that Pakistan, which we know only as an exporter of terror, itself is a great victim of terror
 kabhi sena kaa mukhyalay, kabhi koi masjid, kabhi bazaar, kabhi skool or kabhi koi malala, pakistan aatankwaadi hamalon kaa sabase bada centre ban gaya he
 Along with this, there are also reports in which many international terrorists from Osama bin Laden are found in Pakistan
 yani pakistan aatank kii ek aisi gutthi he jo khud ke liye or apane pados ke liye khatre kii ghanti he
 See photos of the attack, what should be done in such a situation? Can India live peacefully next to boiling Pakistan in this way? Will the heat and hot steam there let the people of India remain relaxed for a long time
 aise main kya jarurat is baat kii nahin he ki ham apane is abujh padosi ke saath kam se kam aatankwaad ke mudde par kuch thos niti banaaen
 If India makes such a proposal, then Pakistan will have no choice but to accept it
 upar se antarrashtriya birdari bhi pakistan par is baat ke liye dabaav daalegi
 Now we cannot live with friendship-kutty relationship like children
 antarrashtriya manch par subah munh pherana or agali shaam haath mila lenaa kisi gambhir kootneeti kaa sandesh nahin he
 We have to understand and accept Pakistan, no matter how obstructive it may be
 aatankwaad ke mudde par bharat or america ke sahyog se zyada jaruri he bharat-paak sahyog
 Because we will not be able to escape our own terrorism by saying that the terrorists came from Pakistan or the ISI is behind the attack
 bade bhai yaa bade padosi ke naate hamen apni agenciyon ke madhyam se bhi aatank ke asli centre ko pakadana hoga
 Because the mathematics of terror is now entangled
 paisa kahin se aa rahaa he, paisa le koi or ja rahaa he, aatankwaadi jhanda kisi sanghathan kaa uthaae hai or unki panaahagaah koi duusari he
 There is no practical benefit to banning any organization nor to inflict damage on any country
 bharat ko koshish kerani chahie ki pakistan kii chuni hui sarkarein vahaan zyada se zyada majboot hon
 And for the strengthening of the Pak government, it will be more useful to get a hand of advice or help rather than giving it a cry from India in international forums
 jaruri nahin ki rishton main ye sudhaar dilli-lahore bas seva jaise dikhaawati rup main ho, zyada behatar hoga ki yah parde ke peeche ke kootnithik sahyog ke rup main ho
 After all, no human wants to live in grief and terror, how can the common Pakistani be an exception to this? Today the first reaction of the common Indian on the massacre of children in Peshawar is that much is going wrong, so attacks in India But as a human being, common Pakistani would also say the same
 hamen is aam soch ko satta ke bichauliyon kii soch par haaavee karnaa hoga
 If India is a big brother, then it has to realize it in every way, even if it has to be a little leaking and it is hurting pseudo nationalism immediately

 pehle test main shandaar jeet darj karne ke baad aatmavishvaas se labarej bhartiya team shanivaar ko australia ke khilaaf shuru ho rahe duusare cricket test main is pradarshan ko doharaakar aparaajey badhat lene ke iraade se utregi
 The Indian team, which won the first match on the basis of a brilliant performance by double century captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and 12 wicket-taking off-spinner r Ashwin, will have to avoid complacency
 dhoni and company ko yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki england kii tarah australian team bhi siries main pichhadane ke baad vaapasi naa karne paye
 The England team led by Alastair Cook won the previous Test series 2–1
 test cricket main kaaphi samay se kharaab pradarshan kar rahi bhartiya team ke liye dhoni kaa shandaar farm sanjivani sabit hua he
 Dhoni is currently leading from the front
 pichhali baar rajeev gandhi stadium par bharat ne newjiland ke khilaaf ek pari or 115 ran se jeet darj kii thi jisamen aswin ne 85 ran dekar 12 wicket liye the
 The match would have ended on the third day if the rain had not fallen
 team india ke liye acchhee baat yah he ki aswin is samay bhi behtareen farm main hai or siries main ahm bhoomika nibhaaenge
 There is no dilemma of selection even before the host team
 use haalanki yah tay karnaa hoga ki sthaneey khilaadi pragyan ojha ko unke gharelu maidan par utaara jaye yaa nahin
 Murali Vijay and Virender Sehwag may have flopped in Chennai but Dhoni and the team management would not like to tamper with the opening pair
 bhartiya captain vijayi team main adhik badlaav ke himachati nahin rahete hai
 There is no scope for any change in the middle order
 aise main sawaal ek hi he ki chennai main upeksha kaa shikaar hue ojha ko apane gharelu maidan par khilne kaa mauka miltaa he yaa nahin
 Dhoni will have to consider the bowling combination
 ojha saurashtra ke harfanmaulaa ravindra jadeja se kahin behatar vikalp he lekin jadeja ne pehle test main paanch wicket lekar aswin kaa bakhubi saath nibhaayaa
 Harbhajan Singh did not look in the best form in the first innings but he did better in the second innings
 bharat chaar spinneron ko lekar utarane kii galati nahin karnaa chahega jaisaa england ke khilaaf nagpur main kiya tha
 To put pressure on Australia, however, Ojha has to be fielded in lieu of a fast bowler
 eshanth sharma or bhubaneshwar kumaar puraani gend se reverse swing paidaa nahin kar paa rahe or naa hi unase australian ballebaajon ko koi pareshaani ho rahi he
 One of these can be excluded
 duusari ore australian team duusare visheshgy spinner ko lekar utarana chaahegi
 Captain Michael Clarke is well aware that Nathan Lyon is by no means the best spinner like Graeme Swann, nor does left-arm spinner Xavier Doherty have the ability to be like Monty Panesar
 abhyaas maichon main doharty kaa pradarshan acha rahaa
 At the same time, Glenn Maxwell, who became the 'million dollar player' of the IPL, may get a chance due to being an all-rounder
 doharty ko tej gendbaaj peter sidle yaa mishael stark kii jagah utaara ja saktaa he
 Australian middle-order batsmen have not been able to perform as expected, so some changes are possible
 philip huge spinneron ko bakhubi nahin khel paye
 Usman Khawaja may get a chance in his place
 shen watasan ko bhi tisare number par khiskaaya ja saktaa he
 The two teams are as follows: india-mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, Murali Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan, Cheteshwar Pujara, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha, Ishant Sharma, Ashok Dinda , Bhuvaneshwar Kumar
 australia-maaikel clark, aid kowan, david warner, phil huge, shen watasan, mathew vade, glen maxwell, mishael janson, peter sidle, mishael stark, nathan leone, moijes henrics, james patinson, jevier doharty, jaikson bird, osman khwaja, steve smith

 On the other hand, mob lynching was another incident as AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisin surrounded the Modi government and questioned the functioning of the central government, terming the four years of Modi rule as 'lynch Raj'
 hamane police ko bulayaramgarh sebijapi vidhayak gyandev ahujane ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki rakabar khan kii maut kaaryakartaaon kii pitayee se nahin hui balki police kii pitayee se hui he
 The activists had called the police saying that we had caught the cow smugglers
 unhone aage kaha ki uske baad gaanvvaalon ko dikhaane ke liye police ne do jagah rakabar khan kii pitayee bhi kar di
 There was a place where he was caught and beaten up there
 jab police gaanv se gau-taskar ko lekar gai thi to rakabar khan hosh main tha or thik tha
 The police may have killed him on the way
 bijepi ke vidhayak gyandev aahujyapani sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa karte hue kehete hai ki apni jaan bachaane ke liye unhone do logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The arrested Dharmendra Yadav and Paramjit Sarkar were not on the spot
 unase poochtacha karne ke naam par thane main phone karke bulaayaa tha or unako giraftaar kiya he
 Ahuja said that he would oppose this arrest
 marane vaala vyakti ko to police bhi taskar maanati he
 Ahuja defended the beating, saying that no person living in this country could tolerate smuggling of his mother
 ahuja yaheen nahin ruke unhone kaha ki kuch logon ko fansaane ke liye police ne yah chaal chali he
 It is an old habit of the Alwar police that they do this kind of work to trap others
 yah bhi kaha ki marane vaala gau taskar tha agar vah gau taskari kar rahaa tha to jo log gaay ko mata samajhate hai vah kya karte
 Some two or four slaps can be beaten and we have talked to the workers in the village there, they said that we had slapped only two or four
 agar peet-petakar maar de dete to phir police ko phone karke kyon bulaate?gyandev ahuja ne yah bhi kaha ki ho saktaa he ki uski maut pitayee se nahin vah balki dar ke maare heart atake aa gaya ho
 Earlier, at the time of the death of Aspect Khan, he also said that the cow who smuggled would die
 pahalu khan maamle main logon kii giraftaar kaa virodh karte hue kaha tha pahalu khan harntac se mara he or use kisi ne nahin maaraa
 MLA Gyan Dev Ahuja is known for his amazing statements, but this time he has directly attacked his own party
 ek taraf vasundhara raaje is ghatana kii ninda kar rahi hai or grahamantri gulabchand kataaria sakhti baratane kii baat kar rahe hai to duusari taraf gyandev ahuja aropiyon ko clin chit dete hue raaj sarkaar ko hi katghare main khadaa kar rahe hai
 Muslims have no right to live: Owaisiovasi criticized the incident saying that under Article 21 of the constitution, the life of cow has become a basic right in the country and because of that Muslims who are being killed have no right to live
 
 ovaisi ne sidhe taur par modi sarkaar ke chaar saalon ko lynch raaj qaraar diya he
 At the same time, Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has criticized the incident on behalf of the government, but has also raised questions
 unhone kaha ki yah ghatnaayen kyon hoti hai, iske peeche janaa hoga
 On the incidents of mob lynchings in BJP ruled states, Meghwal said that such incidents are coming out as Modiji is becoming popular
 unhone kaha ki yah sab modi ji kii prasaddhi se darkar kiya ja rahaa he
 Will reach the culprits: Gulabchand Kataria, Home Minister of Katariyarajasthan said, 'the government is trying to identify the culprits and reach them
 is baar sakht karrwai kii jaaegi
 He said whoever is involved
 use bakhsha nahin jayega
 If this incident happened, then it is shameless
 ham isaki puri jaankaree le rahe hai or police ke aalaadhikariyon ko maukey par bheja gaya he
 At the same time, Sher Mohammad, the patron of the Alwar Meo Panchayat, has said that a mobocracy has been created
 pradhanmantri or grahamantri tak apil kar chuke hai ki aise gunda tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaae
 But due to lack of strict action and honoring the accused of mob leaching, they have been elevated
 isliye aisi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai
 Rakbar Khan was beaten to death by some people in Lalwandi village of Ramgarh police station area
 jaankaree he ki rakabar khan ke saath do gaay thi
 Seeing this, some people beat him to death on suspicion of cow smuggling
 philhal police ne shav ko kabje main le liya or gaayon ko goshaala main bhej diya gaya
 Postmortem of the body will be done from the medical board
 mritak rakabar khan haryana ke kolgav kaa nivasee he
 As the summer season begins, everyone's heart wakes up to go on a walk
 par agar aap in garmiyon main bangkok, singapore, colombo yaa dubai janaa chaah rahe hai, to bahut mumkin he ki aapaki yah khwaahish puri na ho paae
 The reason is that there are no seats available on the flight to go there
 vaise to in jagahon ke liye flite yaa siton kii koi kami nahin hoti he, lekin lubhaavne package kii vajah se is sijan main ab koi seat khaali nahin he
 Not only this, foreign tour is much cheaper than many tourist places located in the country
 tabhi to isamen koi aashcharya nahin he ki zyaadaatar bhartiya garmi kii chhuttiyon main videsh janaa pasand karte hai, chaahe vahaan jaakar mouj-masti kerani ho, khariddaari kerani ho yaa koi bijness deal karnaa ho

 More than half of the visitors to Thailand visit Thailand, Malaysia, Colombo, Dubai and Singapore
 STIC trevell group ke subhash goyal kehete hai, 'bharatiyon ko ab honkong, makaao, manila, istambul or greece jaisi jagah bhi lubhaane lagi he'
 China is also showing rapid rise in the list of favorite tourist destinations of Indians
 pichley saal china ke anya paryaton sthalon kii tulana main beijing or china kii diwaar kaa didaar karne waalon kii sankhya kareeb 65 hajaar rahi
 Many flights to China leave via Bangkok or Taiwe
 trevell agents association of india (TAAI) ke rajinder raay kehete hai, 'dilli or phuket ke bich sidhi flite bhi ekadam phul he'
 He said that Indians like shopping and fun more
 bharat ke log videsh main nite life bhi pasand karte hai
 Knowing the countries of south-east Asia is well suited for the idea of distance, straight route and also from pocket perspective
 rajinder raay ne kaha, 'greece yaa istambul ghoomane jane ke liye bhartiya prati vyakti ek saptaah ke liye 1 lakh rupee tak kharch karne ko taiyaar ho jate hai'

 ab yuva job nahin khoj rahaa balki job de rahaa he
 Shah, who was on a three-day visit to Bhopal, was addressing the public along with CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 iske saath hi bhopal ke laal parade ground par yojit bhavy samaaroh main bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne schuli bacchon ko sweekruti patr pradaan kar mukhyamantri medhaavi chaatr yojana kaa shubharambh bhi kiya
 Trusting the youth, Amit Shah, national president of BJP said that the responsibility of creating Knew India is on the shoulders of the youth of the country 
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi unhen or shashakt bananaa chaahati he
 Shah also said that under the leadership of Narendra Modi, India has become the fastest growing economy in the world
 jab se modi sarkaar satta main aayi he tab se bharat kaa tej gati se vikaas ho rahaa he
 Amit Shah praised Shivraj, also praised Madhya Pradesh's organization and Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 shah ne kaha ki madhya pradesh kaa sarvangin vikaas bhaajapa kii sarkaar or siem shivaraj singh chouhan ke netritv main ho rahaa he
 At the same time, Amit Shah along with CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan ate food on a leaf at a tribal lotus house in the village of Savania, Bhopal
 uske baad shivaraj singh chouhan ne bhi aam janata ko sambodhit karte hue apane kaarykaal main madhya pradesh main lagu hue kai yojanaon ke bare main bataaya
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan announced that girls will be given 33 percent reservation in jobs of every department except forest department
 vahiin un students kii padhai kaa kharchaa bhi sarkaar uthaaegi, jinhone pichley yaa do saal pehle 12veen main 75 pratishat yaa sibiesai main 85 pratishat marks score kiya he
 If this students wants to do medical or engineering, then BJP will bear the cost of their education
 teen divasiy daure par aae shah pichley kuch dinon se party ke kor group ke sadasyon, pradesh padaadhikariyon, saansadon, vidhayakon or jila adhyakshon kii sanyukt baithak bhi kar rahe hai
 He also gave a press conference and gave a statement on many controversial issues
 madhya pradesh ke do mantriyon babulal gaur or sartaaj singh ko 75 varsh kii umr puri karne par mantri pad se hataae jane ko lekar puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main shah ne kaha tha ki kise mantri bananaa or nahin bananaa he yah rajya ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kaa adhikaar he, lekin party main na to aisa niyam he or na hi parampara ki 75 varsh kii aayu paar kar chuke logon ko chunaav nahin ladane dena he, ve chunaav lard sakate hai
 At the same time, on the Ram temple, he had answered the media's questions and said that our stand in this matter is clear and in our manifesto also we have said that a Ram temple should be built when the court's decision comes or on the basis of mutual agreement
 shanivaar ko samvaadadaataaon se charchaa ke dauraan kaha, "modi sarkaar ne teen varsho ke kaarykaal main garib mahilaon, garibon, kisaano, javaanon ke hit main mahatvapurn faisle liye hai, pakistan par sargical stike karke apni takat kaa ehsaas karaayaa
 The country's growth rate is increasing rapidly
 " On Sunday, PM Modi planted the evergreen Ashoka plant in Sri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena's residence and Rashtrapati Bhavan complex
 bataur pradhanmantri duusari baar shapath lene ke baad pehali videsh yatra ke duusare charan main ravivaar ko srilanka pahunche modi 'padosi pratham' kii apni niti par chalate najar aa rahe hai
 Sirisena welcomed Modi to the President's Secretariat
 pradhanmantri ne yaheen par ashok kaa paudha lagaaya
 a plaque has also been placed near the plant, on which it is written, 'ashok Sarka Ashoka', Prime Minister Narendra Modi planted in Colombo on June 9, 2019
 raashtrapati sirisena ne apane cabinet sahyogiyon kaa bhi parichay pradhanmantri modi se karaayaa
 Earlier, Prime Minister Modi was given a grand welcome at Rashtrapati Bhavan
 (input: bhashaa) When it was decided that Narendra Modi would become the Prime Minister of the country, only his oath was yet to be taken, then on 20 May 2014, Modi gave a message that he was the supreme parliament in democracy
 lekin aath din baad jab unke pramukh sachiv kii niyukti sansad main kanoon banane ke bajaae adhyadesh ke jariye kii gai to yah sandesh bhi gaya ki sansad he to sarvocch, par ise nibhaana kathin he
 Since then, the Modi government has had to bring several ordinances one after the other on important subjects from the medical entrance exam to NEET
 isaki vajah sirf yah nahin thi ki sansad chal nahin rahi thi, vajah yah bhi thi ki sansad ke ucch sadan rajyasabha main apane vidheyak paas karaane laayak bahumat sarkaar ke paas nahin tha
 Now after two years, politics is going to take some such turn, when the Rajya Sabha will not remain impregnable fort for the Modi government
 agar sarkaar baaki dalon ko dhang se manaa le to bahut-se maamalon main rajyasabha main vah congress ke virodh ko naakaam kar sakati he
 If you look at the arithmetic of the Rajya Sabha, then of the 241 members, Congress has 64 and BJP 49 members
 anya dalon ke 119 saansad hai, jabaki namit saansadon kii sankhya 9 he
 In this way, the Congress party in the Rajya Sabha with its 15 additional mps and other opposition parties, did not allow the Modi government to do anything arbitrary
 yahaan tak ki sarkaar nau maheene sir patake kar rah gai, lekin vivaadit bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh rajyasabha se paas nahin ho sakaa
 But after the biennial elections for 57 seats of Rajya Sabha, the number of Congress members in Rajya Sabha will be reduced to 57, while the number of BJP members will increase to 55
 iske alaava 2016 main manonith kiye gaye chaar sadsy bhi voting kii sthiti main bijepi ke saath hi jaaenge
 Though the Congress still has a few nominated members, but even though members like Kickrate stars Sachin Tendulkar and actress Rekha have been nominated by the Congress, it is difficult to believe that they will stand behind the party at all times
 badale hue rajnatik sameekaran par bijepi mahasachiv bhupendra yadav ne kaha, ''rajyasabha main vyaavhaarik rup se bijepi ke paas congress se zyada saansad ho jaaenge
 In such a situation, the legislative work of the country will be better done with the positive support of other parties
 '' vaise bhi vitt mantri arun jetali jis tarah baar-baar jor dekar kah rahe hai ki sansad ke aagaamee monsoon satr main jiesti vidheyak paarit ho jayega, uske peeche is badale hue ankaganit kii badi bhoomika he
 But this role is not so clear
 in samikarnon ke badalane ke saath hi kshetreey dalon kaa paimaana bhi upar-neeche hoga
 At present, the Samajwadi Party is the third largest party in the Rajya Sabha with 15 members and its membership will increase to 19 in July
 sapa bhale hi sampradayikta ke mudde par bijepi se alag dikhti rahi ho, lekin janhit ke naam par kuch muddon par use apane saath laana bijepi ke liye kathin nahin hoga
 Although party MP Munawwar Salim says, "SP does politics of values, there is no place for bargaining
" ''basapa kii siten 10 se ghatakar 6 ho jaaengi
 On the other hand, Jayalalithaa's party currently has 12 seats and her political power may remain unchanged or to some extent there will be a shortage of one seat
 jis tarah tamilnadu main jayalalita kii virdohi dramuk upie kaa ang he, usamen jayalalita kii jodi congress ke saath nahin banati or unhen muddon par saath laane kaa vikalp hameshaa bijepi ke paas he
 Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress also has 12 seats in the Rajya Sabha, and this time the way the Congress has become the main opposition party in West Bengal, the BJP can put at least some issues on the Trinamool
 modi ke dhur virdohi nitish kumaar ke jediu kii rajyasabha siten 13 se ghatakar 9 ho jaaengi, haalanki isi anupaat main lalu yadav kii siten bad jaaengi
 The seats of bjp's ally Telugu Desam Party will also increase from 6 to 8
 udhar, telugana se telugana raashtra samiti (tiares) kii siten 3 ho jaaengi
 Both of these will be bjp's seats
 shivasena kii sadsy sankhya bhi 6 se badhkar 8 ho jaaegi, udhar sharad pavaar kii rashtravaadi congress party kii sadsy sankhya 6 se ghatakar paanch rah jaaegi
 There will be no change in the status of the Biju Janata Dal with 7 seats, but the BJD has not been a party opposing the BJP on every issue anyway
 badale hue samikarnon par congress mahasachiv or madhya pradesh se rajyasabha saansad digvijay singh kaa do-took kahana he, ''congress shuru se hi sansad or sadak donon jagah jimmedaar vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi he
 There is no change in our role
 ham sansad main sangh kaa agenda nahin chalane denge
 "but it is also true that even if the game of Rajya Sabha has not completely come out of the hands of the Congress, the matter is now at par
 ab bijepi ke ranneetikaron ko yah dikhaanaa he ki kis tarah sapa, eiediemke, trinmul congress or biju janata dal jaise dalon ke saath samay-samay par sameekaran sadhakar ve rajyasabha ko chalaa le jate hai
 In such a situation, everyone will keep an eye on the promises of economic reforms and jobs, which have been avoided till now in the name of the opposition
 jaahir he ki mulaayam singh yadav, jayalalita or mamata banerjee na sirf rasukhdaar netaa hai, balki acha khaasaa maan manuval karwaane main yakeen rakhte hai
 In such a situation, even if Modi's confidants do not have to bow down to persuade them, as Narendra Modi has staked on the steps of Parliament, but the spine has to be rotated at least 60 degrees

 isro's contact with lander Vikram was not easy to touch Mayusichand in Tisarisro's control room
 India's lunar mission suffered a setback when ISRO lost contact with Lander Vikram just two kilometers before the lunar surface
 isro kaa mishan chandrayan-2 bhale hi itihaas nahin bana sakaa lekin vaigyanikon ke jazbe ko desh salaam kar rahaa he
 The country was eagerly waiting for the night to complete the mission and create history for the country, but in a few moments there was disappointment
 darasal, 48 din ke mahatvakankshi safar kii manzil tak pahunchane se thik pehle achaanak isro ke control room main ek ajeeb si chuppi chaa gai
 Some time ago, the eyes were anxiously examining every step of the mission Chandrayaan-2 on the screen, she was stunned
 chandrayan-2 kaa safar aakhri or behad chunauteepurn hisse tak pahunch chukaa tha lekin ye intjaar lanbaa khinchne laga or isro kii taraf se aupchaarik elaan kar diya gaya ki lander vikram se centre kaa sampark tut chukaa he
 This mission of Chandrayaan-2 was focused on the world and it was because of this that the scientists of India had made their goal to reach the most difficult part of the moon
 mishan ke mutabik chandrayan- 2 ko chand ke dakshini dhruv par utarana tha
 Sunlight reaches very little on this part of the moon
 is vajah se lander or rover ke liye saura urja hasil kar paanaa mushkil hoga
 These challenges were in front of scientists - no country in the world has been able to reach this part of the moon yet, so scientists did not know about the surface here
 -america ke apollo mishan sahit zyaadaatar mishnon main landing chand ke madhya main kii gai or china kaa mishan chand ke uttari dhruv kii taraf tha
 Chand's rocky ground was also a big challenge for a soft landing, with lander Vikram finding a soft landing space between the two craters
 mushkil se safal hue vikisat deshbhale hi chand par maanav ke pahunchane ke 50 saal ho gaye hon lekin tamaam viksit deshon ke liye bhi chand ko choona aasaan nahin rahaa he
 Russia sent about 33 missions to the moon between 1958 and 1976, 26 of which could not reach their destination
 vahiin america bhi is hode main peeche nahin tha
 From 1958 to 1972, 17 of the 31 US missions failed
 yahi nahin america ne 1969 se 1972 ke bich 6 maanav mishan bhi bheje
 In these missions, 24 astronauts reached close to the moon but only 12 were able to land on the moon
 iske alaava isi saal april main isroyal kaa bhi mishan chand adhuraa rah gaya tha
 This mission of a private Israeli company came into the lunar orbit on April 4, but it lost contact with the Earth after being 10 kilometers away
 ummid kii kiran bana orbittrbeshak bharat ke vaigyanikon ne chand ke anjaane hisse tak pahunchane, kai mahatvapurn jaankariyon kii jutaney kii badi chunauti kii taraf apane kadam badaye the
 The orbiter that carried Chandrayaan-2 closer to the floor is still orbiting the moon
 ab vaigyanikon ko intjaar he ki aankadon se nikalne vaale nateezon kaa or orbitor se milane vaali tasveeron kaa
 So that the last 15 minutes of scientific analysis is possible
 lander vikram ke saath sampark tuutane kii vajahon kaa adhyayan vishleshan kiya jayega
 The challenges that led to this mission being considered the most difficult mission ever
 usase nipatane ke nae tareeke bhi dhunde jaaenge
 In this sense, the mission of Chandrayaan-2 will prove to enrich the experience of scientists to move towards this very difficult goal
 supreme court ke varisht vakil or bijepi ke purv netaa ram jethmalani nekaladhanmaamle main vitt mantriarun jetlico chitthee bheji he
 In a letter written on Thursday, Jaitley has heard a lot of good luck
 unhone kaha ki supreme court main chal rahe is maamle main jetali ne moorkhtapurna kadam uthaaya he
 He accused Jaitley of doing nothing in this case while being the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and to turn the Supreme Court after becoming the Finance Minister
 varisht vakil ram jethmalani hikaladhanmaamle main mukhya yachikakarta hai
 Addressing Jaitley in the letter, he wrote, 'I think from the way you behave in this matter, like many others, you do not want the truth to be revealed
 ’pichley hi hafte sarkaar ne supreme court main videshi bainkon main avaidh dhan ikatta karne vaale bharatiyon kaa naam ujagar karne main apni asamarthta jataai he
 The reason for this is bilateral double taxation avoidance treaties or DTAT
 jethmalani ne apni chitthee main jetali kii khub class lagaai he
 He said, Germany has never spoken about DTAT, but our leaders often speak in such a way, which slows down the entire investigation process and prevents corrupt rulers from getting arrested or coming to justice
 isi saal april main lichensten (liechtenstein) bank main bhartiya khataadharakon ke naamon kii list supreme court ko di gai thi
 But the then UPA Government and now the NDA Government have been consistently saying that these names cannot be disclosed due to DTAT
 tata naino ke sanand plant ke paas khoraj gaanv gujarat ke sabase zyada dhanapati gaanvon main shumaar hota he
 Most of the bank account holders here are high net individuals
 yahaan kaa state bank of india aasapaas ke chah gaanv main iklauta bank he, phir bhi yahaan laaine nahin hai
 Bharat Chavda is among the top 10 account holders of State Bank of India here
 wo teen din pehle aae the, tab unhen aaj dopaher kaa token mila tha
 Today he came comfortably and went without withdrawing his money from the bank
 koi bheed nahin
 Around 2010, large-scale industries were acquired in this area, making the people of India many millionaires and millionaires
 aise main yahaan paison ke liye zyada maaramaari honi chahie thi, lekin is shanti kii vajah he bank kaa management
 The bank had already implemented a token system from day one
 bank main 8,000 se zyada khatedaar hai
 So everyone gets the money easily and no one has to stand in the queue and also do not have to return the money, the manager here arranged for it
 bank menager rahul jotawa kehete hai ki 'meraa village echenai (hai networth indiviual) he, yani jiskaa 20 lakh se zyada kaa deposit hota he
 It was not possible to harass or queue him
 aakhir bahut sahejkar laae gaye the ye khatedaar
 He thought that the bank had a customer base of around 8,000 and the number of working days was around 40, so he did the math that if he would serve 200 people in a day, then he would be able to deal comfortably
 log tanaav main na aaen, isliye token system lagu kar diya gaya
 The comments sab kuch sahi tareeke se chale, isliye bank manager khud bank ke baahar baithkar logon se baat karte hai
 The bank has also made some people of the village as bank friends, so that there is no ruckus and the facility will be fully available
 is bank ne aasapaas ke ilaake ke liye bhi misaal kaayam kii he ki mushkilon bhari paristhiti main bhi kaise achche management se logon ko suvidha pradaan kii ja sakati he
 Of course priority is given in medical emergency
 shaayad yahi vajah he, jahaan desh main zyaadaatar jagahon par log bainkon se khafa hai, khoraj gaanv ke log bank karypranali se puri tarah santusht hai

 Bank manager Rahul Jotwa says that 'my village is HNI (high Networth Individual), ie a deposit of more than 20 lakhs
 use pareshaan karnaa yaa qatari main khadaa karnaa sambhav nahin tha
 After all, these account holders were brought in very saved
 unhone sochaa ki bank ke paas customer base kareeb 8,000 kaa tha or kaamkaaji dinon kii sankhya kareeb 40 thi to ganit bithaaya ki agar ek din main 200 logon ko sarvice denge to bhi aaraam se nipat paaenge
 People did not get under stress, so the token system was implemented
 tippaniyan Everything goes the right way, so the bank managers sit outside the bank and talk to people
 bank ne gaanv ke hi kuch logon ko bank mitra bhi banaaya he, taaki kisi tarah kaa hangaamaa na ho auki suvidha puri tarah milti rahe
 This bank has also set an example for the surrounding area that how people can be facilitated with good management even in difficult situations
 medical immergency main beshak praathamikta di jaati he
 Perhaps this is the reason, where people are angry with banks at most places in the country, the people of Khorj village are completely satisfied with the bank functioning

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Passing through a busy road in Ujjain, 26-year-old Abrar Khan turned his attention to the huge hoardings of advertising, which was related to earning a hefty job by doing online jobs on the Internet
 abraar ne us par likhe number par phone milaayaa to pataa chalaa ki trade jone naam kii company kii website par har hafte jaakar vigyapanon par clic karne ke badale unhen 500 ru
 Will meet
 lekin vigyapanon tak pahunchane ke liye unhen aaidi kii jarurat thi, jiskaa panjiyan karwaane ke liye abraar ko company ko 2,100 ru
 Had to give lekin isse paisa to mila nahin, balki panjiyan shulk se bhi haath dhonaa padaa
 Abrar then filed a complaint against the trade zone dealer Rajendra Sabu
 ve kehete hai, “police ko sakht kadam uthaane chahie kyonki yah hajaaron berozegaron kii jindagi ke saath khilwaad he
 Like the trade zone, the victims of money laundering in many fake companies are reaching the Ujjain range IG Upendra Jain in large numbers
 jain kehete hai, “aisa vyapaar karne vaali companiyon kii kaaryastylee kii padtaal kar rahe hai
 Cases have been registered against people associated with the trade zone
 ” ujjain main aisi lagbhag ek darjan companiyaan hai
 The trade zone, which started business last December, paid customers with ID for one or two weeks, but soon the company website was closed along with the payment
 maamle kii padtaal kar rahi team ke agua atirikt police adheekshak mahavir singh mujalde bataate hai, “pataa chalaa he ki yah california kii company he
 It has no office in India
 iske pramotaron kaa pataa laga rahe hai
 They are also trying to know where the money was taken from the people, where did the money go? ”there has been a spate of complaints against fake companies
 peshey se contractor ujjain ke 37 varshiya punit jain ne shailendra jain naam ke dealer ke jhaanse main aakar 1,30,000 ru
 Took 52 ids of the trade zone
 ujjain ke hi praveen sethiya or rahul porwal ne bhi trade jone ke dilers ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karwaai he
 But due to lack of printed documents, investigation is difficult
 company aaidi kii panjiyan raashi par sarvice tex vasuulati thi, isliye customs and central exise vibhaag yah jaanch kar saktaa he ki tex vaaki jamaa karaayaa gaya he yaa nahin
 Those who paid money for clicks also used to deduct tax on its income, which was deposited or not, it is also a matter of investigation
 abraar khan kehete hai, “in companiyon kaa len-dein nakad main hota he, isliye tex jamaa hua hoga, isamen andeh he
 Abrar also invested in Jaipur-based Stay Well Infotech
 ve kehete hai, “stewel kisi tarah kaa bhugtan nahin kar rahi he
 But despite many complaints, a case has not been registered against it
 ” eespi mujalde kehete hai, “dhokhadhadi ke saboot milane par maamle darj kar rahe hai
 The Stay Well website shows that Rs 5,500
 dene par 52 hafte tak 1,000 ru
 There was a plan to advertise per se
 ujjain kii company prithvi utility bhi online vigyaapan kaa kaam karti he
 Its director Sanjay Goyal claims that he has obtained permission for this work
 goyal bataate hai, “ham 12,000 ru
 i give ID sarvice tex alag liya jaataa he
 ”but according to sources, crores of rupees
 ke turnover vaali aisi companiyaan len-dein main check kaa istemaal nahin karatin, jisase andeh utpann hota he
 And as Mujalde says, "people should understand that no one has the lamp of Alauddin who can distribute this much money
" jinaki shikaayat nahin ai he, unki bhi der-saver aegi

 The result was that in the mid-term exam i got 32 out of 100 marks in Maths
 bilkul border par pahunchakar shahid hua
 According to the rules of the school, it was necessary to get the parents' signatures on the report card, so the father did not have to meet the father happily by showing 32 numbers, but yes, on the goings-on, and in Doordarshan's days, painting and in the week

 Today, the counterfeiting controversy of the marks of the Minister of State for Education, Ramshankar Katheria, refreshes the old memories for years
 pehle shikshaamantri smriti irani degree vivaad main ghiri thim, aaj unke junior par aarope lage hai ki unki grajuation kii marksheet nakli he
 In 2010, his anti-bsp candidate had filed a complaint of forgery and dishonesty against him, and alleged that Katheria forged his BA second year and MA final marksheets to get a lecturer job at Agra University
 katheria ne enditivi se kaha ki unke khilaaf jaalsaji kaa yah maamla raajnneetik rup se prerit tha
 He hoped that he would come out unmolested
 hoicourt ne maamle ko agra sthit seshan court ke paas bhej diya he, jisaki sunwaayee 26 november ko hogi
 NDTV has copies of the marksheet presented in the court, which is said to be fake, and it is alleged that forgery was committed not once, twice
 eme final kii marksheet main bataaya gaya ki saahitiyik lekhan ke siddhanton vishay main unhen 38 number mili tha, lekin unki kathith nakli marksheet 72 number bataa rahi he
 The marksheet of BA Second Year is also being said to be fake, because in Hindi literature where they got 43 numbers, 53 numbers were recorded in the marksheet being said to be fake
 saath hi isi tarah angrezi main bhi farji marksheet main 52 number mili dikhaae gaye hai, jabaki bataaya gaya ki unhen vastav main 42 number mili the
 Katheria is bjp's parliamentarian from Agra
 association for democratic riforms kaa kahana he ki ve 21 maamalon main namjad hai
 Many of the cases reported on Katheria are of serious type
 haalanki vittamantri arun jetali ne katheria ke khilaaf is aarope ko khaarij kar diya or kaha ki rajya main prayek bhaajapa kaaryakarta ke khilaaf ek aapraadhik maamla he, jo akhilekh yadav sarkaar ne darj karaayaa he
 Today it came to know that i am not the only vicious person in this world
 mujh ser kaa bhi koi sava ser he
 My pocket money was increased only, Katheria ji has also got a ministerial post and that too of the Minister of State for Education
 kehete hai na, jhooth ke paanv nahin hote, zyaada der tak nahin tikta
