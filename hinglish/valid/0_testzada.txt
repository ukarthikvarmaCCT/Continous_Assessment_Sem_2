 In British culture, most traditional units start with a large number of counties which contain small divisions
 Within those entities are the large and small cities or towns, which may or may not be the county seat
 Some of the world's larger cities culturally, if not officially, span into multiple counties and those crossing state or provincial boundaries culturally are quite common as well, but are rarely incorporated within the same municipal government
 Many sister cities share a water boundary which quite often serves as a border of both cities and counties
 For example, Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts appear to the casual traveler as one large city, while locally they each are quite culturally different and occupy different counties
 Urban or Rural Division / Area: Indigenous: Sufficient gaps are found in the shabdawalis of these divisions in different parts of the world, due to which sometimes it is very difficult to be very accurate in Hindi translation from other languages

 Comparative politics is a branch and method of political science that is based on comparative studies
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti main do yaa adhik deshon kii raajnneeti kii tulana kii jaati he yaa ek hi desh kii alag-alag samay kii raajnneeti kii tulana kii jaati he or dekha jaataa he ki inamen samanta kya he or antar kya he
 According to Edward Freeman, comparative politics is a comparative analysis and analysis of the various types of political institutions and governments
 rolf bribanti ke anusaar "tulanaatmak raajnneeti sampurna saamaajik vyavastha main un tatwon kii vyakhya he jo raajnneetik kaaryon evam unke sansthagat prakaashan ko prabhavit karte hai
 " es curtis ke shabdon main, raajnneetik sansthaaon or raajnneetik vyavhaar kii karypranali me mahatvapurn niyamittaaon, samaantaaon or asamantaaon kaa tulanaatmak raajnneeti se sambandh he
 Features of comparative politics: ~ raajnneeti vigyaan main tulanaatmak adhyayan krantikari or nayaa nahin he
 Comparative studies have been used in politics from the very beginning
 isiilie blondel ne kaha he ki "tulanaatmak sarkaron kaa adhyayan pracheenatam, atyant kathin or atyadhik mahatvapurn he tathaa shuru se hi manushya ke dhyaan ke aakarshan kaa kendra rahaa he
 "but Aristotle owes a systematic study of comparative political
 arestu ne hi sabase pehle tatkaaleen raajnneetik kii vyavasthaaon main upasthit nirankush tantron, shrenee tantron or prajatantr kii visheshtaon or antaron kaa tulanaatmak drushti se vishad vivechan kiya tha
 Scholars from Aristotle to modern political science have studied, analyzed and categorized political systems to understand political behavior and interpreted new perspectives through new research tools
 raajnneeti or shashan ke tulanaatmak adhyayan kii parampara ham arestu or uske pehle bhi pate hai
 Later thinkers such as Machiavelli, Mantescue, Bryce, Laski, Finner adopted this method
 duusare mahayuddh ke pehle tak iskaa vikaas chote str par hi hota rahaa
 However, after that there were revolutionary developments in the field of comparative politics and it was developed as a new discipline
 aaj saiddhanthik drushtikon se raajnneetishastra kaa yah ek mahatvapurn ang ban gaya he or iske antargat anekon siddhanton va avadharanaon ko janm diya gaya he
 Aristotle was the first political philosopher in old ideas who wanted to give science the status of science
 usne is prakaar kii samasyaon kaa chintan tathaa aisi vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jo aaj bhi raajnneetik ke adhyayan ke kshetra main bahut kuch maanya he
 He used the scientific method after comparative study of 158 constitutions
 arestu ne hi pehali baar raajnneetishastra main aagamanaatmak paddati ko apanaaya
 The second symbol of the development of comparative politics is found in the era of maciavli and Renaissance
 rajya kii utpatti, raajnneetik vyavastha shashan kala ke vishay main nigamanaatmak paddati kaa parityag kar diya gaya tathaa maikayavali jaise vichaarkon ne vaigyanik tatasthta kii niti ko apanaate hue un dinon kii paristhitiyon kaa gambhirtha se adhyayan kiya
 Understood the problems of his era and then came to a conclusion
 is tarah unhone apni adhyayan paddati me anubhavvaad or itihaas vaad kaa samanvay kiya
 He used history and logic to study politics
 montescue or itihaasavaadi yug ke kuch lekhakon main ham raajnneeti ke tulanaatmak adhyayan kaa udai hote dekhte he
 Harry Extine concludes that any reader of modern comparative politics can easily infer that the subjects considered by Montescue fall within his field of study
 montescue ke vichaaron main raajnneetishastra kaa sampoorn maanviya sambadhon ke saath adhyayan kiya janaa chahie jisamen dharamshastra, bhugol, itihaas, manovigyaan, maanavshaastra aadi sabhi vishay kaa adhyayan shaamil he
 Many prominent examples of historian thinkers are in front of us, such as Kant, who believes in development, along with prudence and democracy, Hegel, who considers prudence and freedom as basic, Kamte as the basis of scientific tendency and freedom through class struggle
 Marx who believes in attainment
 in itihaasavaadiyon kii sabase bady dein yah thi ki unhone saamaajik gatishiltaa main, khaas kar vikasvaadi siddhanth main, raajnneetik itihaaskaaron kii ruchi jaagrath kii, jiske kaaran raajnneeti ke vistrut siddhanton kaa janm hua
 He also paid attention to the problems which are related to the problems between politics and economic development, politics and education, social culture and politics
 duusare mahayuddh ke baad tulanaatmak raajnneetik ke kshetra main sahi disha kaa vikaas hu aa
 First there was a slow growth, then rapidly new trends started emerging
 pehle tulanaatmak adhyayan ke mahatv ko samajhate hue naye takanic kii khoj kii, phir nai avadharanaon jaise raajnneetik vishleshan, raajnneetik samajashaastra aadi kaa vikaas hua
 In the last two decades, comparative studies in the field of politics have developed particularly and rapidly
 easton
 amand, karl dow ech
, kolman aadi ne vyavastha siddhanth ke antargat tulanaatmak vishleshan ko nayi disha di
 The principles of the system proved to be very important and useful
 siddhanth ke dwaara rajya or rajya se pare sabhi prakaar kii saamaajik vyavasthaaon kii tulana sambhav hui
 Almost all the scholars developed their own specialized vocabulary and language
 'input', 'output', 'feedback', 'saiburnetics', aadi iskaa udhaaharan he
 Many new methods were adopted for comparative politics research, such as 'boating Study', 'scaling Techniques', 'content Analysis' etc
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti ke vikaas main haal ke varshon main del, eptor rosto, lucian pai, sidney varba, maayran vinar aadi ke yogadan apana vishesh mahatv rakhte hai
 He did not only study western countries, but gave special importance to the study of budding nations and third world
 duusare mahayuddh ke baad tulanaatmak raajnneeti ke kshetra main jin nayi pravritiyon kaa samavesh hua ve nimnlikhit hai : The field of comparative politics has been controversial
 iskaa mukhya kaaran he ki iske paramparaagat or aadhunik drushtikonon main mail nahin khaataa he
 The old political thinkers limited their study area only to the structure of governance and government, whereas modern scholars make its field very wide
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti kaa vishay–kshetra is prakaar he :– Political socialization is an important subject of comparative politics
 raajnneetik samajikaran ek aisi prakriya he jiske dwaara raajnneetik mulyon tathaa drushtikonon ke vishay main jaankaree praapt hoti he
 Political socialization is a long term process
 yah vyakti ke jivan se prarambh hokar uski mrityu tak chalati rahati he
 a person takes interest in various political subjects since his childhood and remains attached to it throughout his life
 raajnneetik samajikaran ko tulanaatmak raajnneeti me isliye shaamil kiya jaataa he kyonki raajnneetik samajikaran par hi kisi raajnneetik pranali kii safalataa yaa asafalataa nirbhar karti he
 Often the process of political socialization in developed countries is rapid
 iske vipareet pichde va vikasshil deshon main yah prakriya bahut dhimi hoti he
 Political culture refers to the attitudes, beliefs, feelings and values of citizens of a political system towards that system
 prayek raajnneetik vyavastha kii apni vishisht raajnneetik samskruti hoti he
 Political culture itself makes it clear how much importance people give to the political system
 vastav main kisi raajnneetik vyavastha kii safalataa yaa asafalataa raajnneetik samskruti par hi nirbhar karti he
 Hence political culture is studied in comparative political studies
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti ke paramparaagat vidwaanon ne vidhaan mandal, karypalika, nyaaypalika tathaa naukarshahi ko hi raajnneetik vishay kshetra mana
 Although more emphasis is placed on the methodological and practical aspect in place of institutions nowadays, political structure cannot be left out at all
 saadharantaya yah mana jaataa he ki antim nirnay lene kii sansad kii shakti din–pratidin kam hoti ja rahi he or yah shakti karypalika ke haathon main aa gai he
 To arrive at the conclusions of this government, it is necessary that we study the executive and legislatures of more and more countries
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti ke vidvan is baat kaa bhi adhyayan karte hai ki ve vyakti jo rajasatta kaa prayog karte hai, samaaj ke kin virgon se sambandhit hai or unki satta kaa kya aadhaar he
 The power of governance in each state lies in the hands of a few specific people or a specific class
 jin deshon me swasth daleey pranali he, vahi shashkon kii bhartee kaa mukhya strot raajnneetik dal hote hai
 Economic inequality and the recruitment of political rulers have a deep connection with political violence and internal strife
 krisis tathaa ward ke shabdon main, "jin deshon main ytnpurvak samaaj main kinhi vishesh virgon ko 'raajnneetik satta' se vanchit rakhaa jaataa he, vahaan ye varg hinsak sadhano se satta hathiyaane kaa prayaas karte hai
 " tulanaatmak raajnneeti main anubhavik adhyayan par adhik bal diya gaya he
 Under this, instead of political institutions, their structures, the behavior of its functional workers or elements is studied
 aadhunik yug loktantr kaa yug he or loktantr main dalon kaa anivaary he
 Political parties are found in almost all countries
 america, great britain, austrailia va germany main dwi–daleey pranali paayi jaati he, jabaki france, italy, norway, bharat ityadi desho main bahudaleey paddati paayi jaati he
 Communist China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam etc
 have a one-party system
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti kaa vidhyaarthee raajnneetik dalon ke sanghathan, kaarykram tathaa kaaryon kaa adhyayan karata he
 Not only political parties, but also interest groups are important aspects of political activism
 hit–samooh dalon or sarkaar kii nitiyon ko nirdhaarit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Trade unions, railway unions, trade unions, business unions etc
 all fall under the category of pressure groups
 Pressure groups in democratic states like USA, UK, France, etc
 greatly influence government decisions, while China, etc
 in communist countries
 Their importance is very less
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti ke vidwaan in prashnon par bhi vichaar karte hai ki – shiksha ke prasar kaa nagarikon ke raajnneetik aacharan or unki raajnneetik sansthaaon par kya prabhaav pasta he ', ek hi samaaj ke antargat rahane waalo vibhinn jatiyon or dharmik nishthaaon main kya parivartan aa jaate hai? kya aarthik vikaas dwaara yah sambhav he ki asia or africa ke nagarikon ko apane parivaar, kul, gaanv, kabeeley, dharm or jati ke prati jo nishthaai hai, dhire–dhire samaapt ho jaaen ore unke sthaan par unamem rashtriyata kii bhaavana viksit ho sake? In comparative politics, not only the governance systems of developed Western countries are studied, but it also studies the governance systems of backward and developing countries of Asia and Africa
 raajnneetik sahabhaagita se abhipraay nagarikon kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon main bhaag lene se he
 Not all political systems have the same level of political participation
 udaar loktantric raajnneetik vyavasthaaon main naagarik raajnneetik gatividhiyon main adhik bhaag lete hai jabaki pichhadi hui tathaa sarvasattavadi raajnneetik vyavastha ko raajnneetik bhagidaari ke adhik avasar nahin milte
 In fact, political participation is considered the criterion of justification of any system
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti main bhagidaari kaa mahatv he
 In every political system, many political processes go on
 prayek raajnneetik vyavastha main nirnay nirmaan kii prakriya, nyaayik prakriya ityadi anek prakriyaayein anwarat rup main chalati rahati hai
 These political processes have an impact on the political system
 isliye tulanaatmak raajnneeti main raajnneetik prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Problems of 'war and peace' and balance of power are considered in comparative politics
 isse sambandhit kuch mahatvapurn prashn hai
 Bureaucracy has a very important role in every political system
 visheshtya vartmaan raajnneetik vyavasthaaon main naukarshahi sarkaar yaa prashasan kii ridh kii haddi ban gai he
 If the modern era is called the bureaucratic era, it will not be wrong
 kalyankari rajya kii dharna ke saath–saath naukarshahi kii bhoomika bhi babbti chali gai
 This is the reason that today, whether policy making or implementation, bureaucracy always remains the first
 naukarshahi ko saamaajik–aarthik parivartan main ek yantra ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaataa he isliye tulanaatmak raajnneeti main naukarshahi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 In the modern era, the subject area of comparative politics is not limited only to the study of political science, but due to the study of the practical political processes of the political system, its subject area has increased considerably
 isi kaaran tulanaatmak raajnneeti ek antavnushasanamak drushtikon ban gaya he
 Now, apart from political science, other social sciences such as sociology, psychology, economics, history, science, chemistry etc
 are also taught in comparative politics
 aadhunik vidwaanon kii manyata he ki raajnneetik vyavasthaaon kii jatiltaaon ko saamaajik or aarthik sandarbhon main hi bhalee prakaar se samajha ja saktaa he
 The relationship of politics is more with the practical and real nature of the political system than the ideal form
 isiilie tulanaatmak raajnneeti main mulya-sakshep raajnneetik siddhanton kaa sthaan mulya-nirpeksh raajnneetik siddhanton ne le liya he
 Thus, the field of comparative politics has become very clear, sure and determined
 ji
 ke 
 robtters kaa kathan sahi lagata he ki, is prakaar yah baat ki tulanaatmak raajnneeti 'kuch bhi nahin he ' galat sabit ho gaya he or iskaa pratipakshi daawa ki yah 'sab kuch he ' sanshodhit ho gaya he
 That is, comparative politics has become its own subject area
 parantu iskaa abhipraay nahi he ki tulanaatmak raajnneeti kaa ek aisa swatantra shaastra ban gaya he jiskaa raajnneeti se koi sambandh nahin he
 The methods adopted by older political thinkers in comparative studies are called traditional approaches
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti ke paramparaagat drushtikon kii paanch mukhya visheshtaayen batalaayi jaati he :– New analyzes and studies were needed in the field of politics
 isliye nayi paddatiyon or drushtikon kii khoj hone lagi
 New methods of analysis and testing and new approaches developed
 yon lard brice, fredrick jaise vidwaanon ne tulanaatmak raajnneeti ko nayi disha dene kii koshish kii, lekin iske sahitya kaa vikaas haal ke varshon main hi hua
 Modern scholars like Amand Lucian Pai, Sidney Verba, David E
 Eptor, gave modern form to comparative politics
 tulana ke liye samaan siddhanton va mulyon kon kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 The modern view of comparative politics is more testing, more investigative and more systematic
 yah adhyayan raajnneetik sansthaaon ke mul main jane kaa prayaas karata he
 In the modern approach, special study of the behavior influenced by ideology of interest groups, pressure groups, political parties
 yah drushtikon raajnneetik or anya vyavhaaron ke bich vaastavik sambandhon kii khoj karata he
 Today there are more than 190 sovereign countries in the world
 naye rashtron kii janata ab upniveshon ke prajajanon kii bhaanti sidhi va namr nahin rahi he
 Today's community is far more politicized than before
 sabhi deshon main jansadharan kii raajnneetik sahabhaagita batch rahi he
 Citizens of the developed countries have also become more politicized than before, and they have begun to want to increase their problems with their governments in full measure
 vartmaan shatee main sanchaar ke kshetra main bhi ek kranti hui he
 The media of reaching the masses has greatly increased the political awakening among the masses
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karti he or use samajhane va samajhane main bady sahaayak he
 Through this, the study of politics has been given a scientific form and practical general rules or principles have been formulated in politics
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti ke adhyayan ke saadhaaran rup main do prayojan hai, jinhen ham, sankshep, main is prakaar rakh sakate hai
 Firstly, it helps us in electing the well-known and likely events in the field of governance and politics abroad
 duusare, vibhinn rajyon kii shashan–paddatiyaan unki aitihaasik va bhugolic dashaon, saamaajik, aarthik va raajnneetik sansthaaon tathaa vichaaron se nirdhaarit hoti hai
 Governance and ideology are closely related in most countries
 tulanaatmak raajnneeti kaa adhyayan samajashaastra ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye, vibhinn kaarnon se upyogi he
 For students of any country, it is similar to the guidance of foreign countries
 vidhyaarthee ko anya deshon ke bare main anek prakaar kii upyogi va shikshaprad jaankaree praapt hoti he
 Likewise, if we compare 20 of the political practices of some of the recently developed independent countries, then in each of them, to gain knowledge of the institutions and their traditions established by the old foreign rulers to understand their present differences
 Necessary
 iskaa gyaan hamen tulanaatmak adhyayan dwaara hi praapt ho saktaa he
 In other words, the structural-functional approach attempts to move into a deeper definition of political practices
 yah prayek paddati main sabase adhik mahatvapurn sansthaaon ko jaanane tathaa unke raajnneetik antaron va samaantaaon ke vargeekaran va spashtikaran tak pahunchane kaa praytn karata hai ham isse raajnneetik vyavhaar or sarkaar ke kaaryon ke bare main pariklpana kaa nirdhaaran kar sakate hai or aise shabdon main jinaki sahaayta se ham vibhinn raajnneetik paddatiyon kii tulana kar saken
 The comparative method is currently in a 'state of flow'
 yah nirnaayak yaa antim sthiti main nahin pahunch paaya he
 Therefore, many difficulties are found in its path
 tulana karne ke liye anek baton kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Pointing to the second problem, Sartori has written that until there is a creation of some suffixes at the macro level, which have maximum knowledge and are comparable, then in politics, comparability is not possible
 iske liye tulana ke vishyon main samanta kaa kuch na kuch ansh aavashyak he or unke bare main adhyayankarta ko puri jaankaree honi chahie
 The third problem arises in relation to the study of the cultures of different nations and the use of foreign languages
 tulanaatmak adhyayan ke liye vibhinn rashtron kii sukritiyon or videshi bhashaaon kii jaankaree jaruri he
 It is not possible for any researcher to get information about all languages and neither it is possible to get correct and complete information about the culture of different countries
 chauthi kathinaayee aankade jamaa karne or rajitisharatra main vaigyanik vidhiyon ke prayog se sambadhit he
 Man's nature, his behavior, the nature of his activities and his institutions are so complex, so variable that it is not easy to collect all the data about him
 in kathinaaiyon ke baavjood raajnneetishastra kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kaaphi lokapriy ho gaya he
 Every day its shortcomings are being removed and efforts are being made to make it more and more complete

 Returning home from Vermont, Will Randall hits a wolf in a car on the way to the woods, fleeing to find a dead wolf by tricking Will
 udhar vil rendal or uske offis sahyogiyon main charchaa he ki unke publicing house ko ek bade hi adiyal arbapati remand elden ne techover kar liya he or vil ko chif in editor ke ohade se hataakar unheen ke adhinsth stewart swinton ko saunpa ja rahaa he
 In the meantime, Will feels himself psychologically transformed, now he has consciousness in his middle and dull senses, like food and physical hunger
 ghar main apni patni sherlot ke kapade sunghte vakt kuch shaq hota he or ghar se daudte hue stewart ke ghar pahunchataa he
 In an attempt to stop Stewart, Will arrives at his bedroom, grinning at the staircases with a bruised tooth on his palm, where Sherlot is convinced of his foulness on the offending situation
 sherlot kii is bevafaayee par vil ghar chhodkar dusre thikaane meyaflower hotel main thahartaa he
 On the other hand, to recover from his loneliness, he indulges in Raymond Alden's unhappy daughter, Laura
 vah lara ke guestaouse par rukta he or tab us puuranamasi kii raat usamen bhedie kii shikari fitrat jaag uthati he, or khidki ke raste kudakar elden kii estate main vichrate ek hiran kaa shikaar karata he
 The next morning, upon falling asleep, Will finds a sleeping bank of the river, but upon seeing his own face and hands stained in the blood, he is terrified and escapes from his hideout in hiding
 doctor se jaruri aupchaarik jaanch ke baad vah bhartiya paranarmal visheshgy da
 vijay elegius se miltaa he, jahaan ve vil main punap rahe us vahashipan se nijaat ke liye ek chaandi kaa tabiz dete he, lekin chunki da
 vijay is girti sehat ke baad umr ke aakhri padaav par he, wo vil ke dansh paakar bhediya maanav banane or is pal-pal kii yatnaa bhari takalif se chhutkaaraa paane ko kehete he
 But as Will himself is aware of this scary change, he refuses, but he keeps the talisman with him, thinking that the animal inside him will not wake up again
 phir shaam ko vil hotel pahunchakar lara se gat raat se gaayab hone ke liye afsos jaahir karata he, or dubaara milane ke liye use hotel aane ko kahata he
 About the same evening as Poonam's moon rises, the wolf inside Will dominates him, and is pulled from the noise of the animals coming from the city's zoo, but before he can do anything, two police officers present there hold him
 And in an attempt to handcuff him, Will arrives on a deserted way out of the wall with great speed, but there are some three picky people threatening to snatch money from him and Will gives Hmlakr hit badly on them
 Will returns to his room, but next morning he remembers nothing about the previous night
 vahiin vil kii koshish main apane sabhi mukhya rytaron kii jamaat ko apane adheen kar mi
 elden se vaapis apane editor in chif kii kursi hathiyaa letaa he, jisaki khabar tailet main maujuud stewart ko chaunkaane ke liye jaataa he, or apni duusari atirikt aadhikarik takat ke jariye use barkhaast karne kii notice detaa he
 On the pretext of this domination, he urges on Stewart's shoes to create his own territory
 gussaye stewart ke baahar jate hi vil tab haath dhokar, ponchney ke liye jab apni jacket se rumal nikaalata he to saath main ek nuchin hui insaani ungali bhi baahar vashbasin main gir padati he
 vil kii pareshaani kaa thikaana nahin rahata or vahaan se badahavaas sa baahar bhaag khadaa hota he
 While passing through the hotel lobby, Will stops Charlotte, and apologizes to Stewart for the end of the ill-fated relationship and repentance, but Will no longer wants to deal with him and be reprimanded
 Says
 While sitting at the nearby waiting coach, Lara listens to both of them, and after Sharlott's departure, Lara follows Will
 kamare main maujuud vil ko apane darinde ke jaagane ke dar se us tabiz ko pahan letaa he, or pichhali raat mili hathkadi se khud ko kaid kar letaa he
 Lara somehow enters the door by opening a hotel key with a key
 vil kii hathkadi ko chhudaane or is teesri mulaakaat main donon hambistar ho jate he
 Meanwhile, when Laura is in a deep sleep, the wolf in the Will wakes up and hunkered down at the park outside in the moonlight night, the people walking around trembled almost out of fear
 At night, Will returns to his bed
 
 The next morning, Detective Carl Bridger and Detective Wade inform Will that someone has brutally slaughtered his wife, Sharlott
 vil is khabar se nidhaal ho jaataa he, detective bridger, vil ko sherlot kii shinaakht or uske sandigdhta jaanane ke liye police stesan par puchhatacha karne ko bulaate he
 In the midst of all this, Stewart and Raymond receive news of Will's wife Sherlot being killed on TV news
 rendal stewart ko kahata he ki agar vil kii is jurm main saboot pukhta hue to us editor in chif kii kursi raay mcelister ko sthanarit kii ja jaaegi
 Then Stewart also says that if nothing is expected from both of them, he would like to return to his job
 vahi lara jab vil ko apane pita ke estate le jaati he, to uski sari shankaae dar main badal jaati he
 The mud in Will's shoes, listening to the phone ring away from his hypersensitive ears, and the detective bridge over the phone revealed that the forensic report of Sherlot's murder found traces of DNA associated with an animal
 ab lara ko yakeen ho jaataa he vil ke dwaara kii sami hatyaon kaa jimmedaar uske andar jaanavar kaa kaam he
 Lara then has to be locked up in a horse stables at the behest of Will and goes to the police station to tweet
 par sanyogvash vahaan stewart miltaa he jo wo sherlot ke katl kii gavaahi dene pahunchaa tha
 But when Stewart's pale eyes, Will's smell from Will's body, Laura realizes that Stewart is also a victim of Will's bites and is also becoming a wolf
 stewart use date karne ko kahkar cabin main chalaa jaataa he or avasar paakar lara vahaan se bhaag nikalati he
 Lara convinces Will to be innocent and decides to flee the city there
 udhar stewart bhi lara ke peechha karte hue uske estate tak pahunchataa he or use rokane kii koshish main getman uski jeep ke neeche kuchlaa jaataa he
 Then Laura is caught by Stewart after another struggle in the garden, but Laura somehow escapes into the stables in an attempt to rape Stewart
 stewart dubaara se lara par jhapatata he, vahiin kaid main bebas vil us tabiz ko tod pinjre se kud lagaakar stewart ko daboch letaa he
 On the night of Purnamasi, the wolf inside both dominates and rages on each other like goths
 vil stewart ko sidhiyon par use patake detaa he or lara kii ore badhata he
 At the back Stewart takes a scissor with bush scissors, Laura quickly finishes by shooting at the dead guard's pistol in front of her
 vil or lara ekatak khamoshi se apni afsos jaahir karte he or vil chupchaap jangal kii ore bhaag nikalataa he
 And almost the same evening the police and Raymond arrive at the scene, Lara almost pretends to be unknown and frightened
 detective bridger lara or vil kii meljol kaa khulaasa karata he lekin lara chaalaaki se baat ko taal detii
 Lara then invites them to drink when the vodka is shed, and Bridges is surprised that he knows how hours have passed
 Lara replies that she learns about the smell a mile away
 ab lara kii ankhon main vahi peelaapan najar aata he
 In a far away place, Will shouts at the moon as a wolf, and Lara's face also turns into a blurred animal

 Symbolism or totem practice refers to the belief of a society in which humans are considered to be related to an animal, tree, plant or other soul
 'totum' shabd ojibve naamak mul america adivasee qabeele kii bhashaa ke 'ototeman' se liya gaya he, jiskaa matlab 'apana bhai / bahan rishtedaar' he
 Its root word is 'ote' which means brothers and sisters born to the same mother, who have a blood relationship and who cannot marry each other
 aksar totum vaale jaanavar yaa vriksh kaa use maanane vaale qabeele ke saath vishesh sambandh mana jaataa he or use maarna yaa haani pahunchaana varjit hota he, yaa phir use kisi vishesh avasar par yaa vishesh vidhi se hi maaraa ja saktaa he
 Clan people also often include it in clan symbols, for example Native American tribes often displayed it in totem pillars
 bharat ke bahut se samudaayon main bhi aise totum paae jate hai
 For example, it is seen that in Maharashtra people bearing the family name of 'tambe' consider Nag as their totem and never kill Nag
 19veen sadi main satapura ke jangalon main rahane vaale bhil logon main dekha gaya ke har gut kaa ek totum jaanavar yaa vriksh tha, jaise ki patange, saanp, sher, mor, bans, pipal, vakairaah
 The tot of one faction was a creeper named 'gavala', on which if a member of that faction accidentally stepped on it, he saluted him and apologized to him
 agar do guton kaa ek hi totum ho to unamem aapas main vivaah karnaa varjit tha kyonki vah ek hi purvaj ke vanshaj maane jate the
 There was a peacock of the Bhil faction called 'mori'
 iske sadasyon ko mor ke pad-chihnon par pair daalana manaa tha
 If the peacock is seen, then the Mori women would cover it or face it on the other side
 pashu-pakshi, vriksh-paudhon par vyakti, gana, jati yaa janajati kaa namakaran atyant prachlit saamaajik pratha he jo sabhy or asabhy donon prakaar ke samaajon main pain jaati he
 This practice is very prevalent in uncultured societies and sometimes it also has the form of tribal religion
 uttari america ke pashchimi tat par rahanevaali haida, tilliggit, kwakitul aadi janajatiyon main pashu aakaar ke vishaal or bhayanak khambhe paae jate hai, jinhen in jatiyon ke log devtaa maanate hai
 For these, the words Todem, Ododem etc
 are used in these castes, whose sound is in the word totem
 madhya austrailia ke arunta adivasee, africa ke purvi madhya pradeshon tathaa bharat kii janajatiyon main yah pratha prachlit hai
 Different forms of this practice are found in different regions of the world
 parantu itihaaskaaron kaa aisa mat he ki pracheen kaal main kabhi totemiyug rahaa hoga, jiske avshesh aaj ke totemi reeti-rivaaj he
 The names of Raineakh and mclannan are notable among such historians

 According to this table, sansar main ganchihnavaad ke lakshan sab kahin ek se nahin paye jate
 For example, iconography is a social practice among the Haida and Tillingit castes, but its religious form is not developed
 madhya austrailia kii arunta jati main totem-dharm or reetiyaan purna viksit hai, totemi pashu kii nakal yaa swaang nahin utaarte
 The religious form of iconography is unattainable in the Bangada caste of Africa

 Traditions of totem-sacrifice and totem-worship are not found there
 adivasee kala par gana kaa prabhaav prachur maatra main miltaa he
 In Chotanagpur and Madhya Pradesh, pictures of totems are seen on the walls of houses
 newjiland ke maori apni naukaaon par apane totem kaa chitra uker dete hai
 In many other tribes, totems are painted on all the clothes, weapons, tools and flags
 visheshat: uttari america or austrailia kii adivasee kala par ganchihn kaa prabhaav bahut gaharaa he
 The members of the totem consider themselves to be supernatural and psychic children of the totem
 ve apane gana main vivaah nahin karte
 Thus the practice of extraterritorialism in totemistic societies is valid
 sar james fckejar kaa vichaar he ki totemwad or bahirvivaah main kaarykaran kaa sambandh he or ve sadaiv saath saath paae jate hai
 The members of the totemi consider blood to be bloodshed due to the totem being a supernatural symbol and do not intermarry for this reason
 bharat main anek totemi jatiyaan hai
 There are more than hundred such ganas in the Santhal caste, whose names are placed on animals, birds and trees
 isi prakaar dakshin bihar kii hi jati main lagbhag pachaas aise totemi gana he
 The Bhils of Rajasthan and Khandesh are divided into 24 ganas, many of which seem to be based on animal herds and trees
 maharashtra ke katakaree, madhyapradesh ke gond or rajasthan ke minaa, milaala aadi jatiyon main bhi ganon ke naam unke pradesh main paae janevaale pashupakshiyon par rakhe jate hai
 Along with the name Totemi Gana, many of the features of totemism are present in all these castes such as treating totem as supernatural ancestors, the objects of the totem and the pictures and signs of the totem are also worshiped as sacred and harsh on destroying the totem
 There is a restriction
 inke saath hi bharat main aisi anek jatiyaan hai jo totem par apane gana athwa samudaay kaa keval naam rakhti he
 There are many who worship only the totem
 majumdaar ne bengal main rahanevaali aisi anek jatiyaan kaa ullekh kiya he
 There are many such castes in Malwa and Rajasthan in which there is no other symptom of totemism except the name
 yah kahana thik nahin hoga ki pashu-pakshi-vrikshon ke poojak sadaiv hi totemvaadi hua karte hai
 In various sects of Hindus, cow, buffalo, monkey, rat, owl, snake, peacock etc
 are worshiped as sacred
 isi prakaar tulsi, bilva, ashwatth or bat kaa pavitra maanakar puujate hai
 But it would be inconsistent to call these sects totemists because they neither name the totem on the totem nor do the members of the guana consider the totem of the totem
 rijgaye kaa vichaar he ki bharat kii ve sab jatiyaan jinamein totemwad kaa ek bhi lakshan paaya jaataa he prarambh main purna rup se totemvaadi thim
 They gradually stopped worshiping their various totems, and now totems are found in them only in the form of Gannam and Ganchaman
