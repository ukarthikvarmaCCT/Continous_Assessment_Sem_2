 Amnesia can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs

 There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia
 retrogred amenesia kisi vishesh taarikh se pehle adhigrahit kii gai jaankaree ko punarprapt karne main asamarthta he, aamtaur par durghatana yaa sanchaalan kii taarikh
 In some cases memory loss may extend for decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory
 antrogred amenesia alpakaalik store se lambii avadhi kii dukaan main nai jaankaree sthanantarit karne main asamarthta he
 People with this type of amnesia may not remember things for long
 ye do prakaar parsparik rup se anany nahin hai; donon ek saath ho saktaa he
 Case studies also show that minesia generally damages the medial temporal lobe
 iske alaava, hippocampus ke vishisht kshetra smriti ke saath shaamil hai
 Research has also shown that when areas of dynesaflon are damaged, labyrinths can occur
 haal ke adhyayanon ne arabiapi 48 protein or memory los kii kami ke bich ek sahasambandh dikhaaya he
 Scientists were able to detect that mice with damaged memory have lower levels of rbap48 protein than normal, healthy mice
 amliya se peedit logon main, tatkaal jaankaree ko yaad karne kii kshamta abhi bhi barkaraar he, or ve abhi bhi nai yaaden banane main sakasham ho sakate hai
 However, a serious decrease in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be seen
 marijon ko nae prakriyaatmak gyaan sikh sakate hai
 In addition, priming can assist Emirates in the learning of fresh non-declarative knowledge
 purv shikshan episod main saamne aane vaali vishisht jaankaree ko yaad karne kii kshamta main gahan haani ke baavjood amenic rogiyon ne bhi bauddhik, bhashaai or saamaajik kaushal ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 The word is from the Greek, meaning 'to forget'; From ἀ-, meaning ‘without’, and μνήσις, meaning ‘memory’
 nai yaadon kaa adhigrahan Patients with amnesia can learn new information, especially non-declarative knowledge
 haalanki, ghaney antrogred amenesia vaale kuch rogiyon ko episod yaad nahin he, jiske dauraan unhone pehle soochna ko siikhaa yaa dekha
 declarative knowledge antrogred emnesia vaale kuch rogi abhi bhi kuch arthpurna jaankaree praapt kar sakate hai, bhale hi yah adhik kathin ho or shaayad adhik saamaanya gyaan se asambandhit rahe
 Hm One could accurately draw a floor plan of the house in which he lived after surgery, even though he had not lived there in years
 kaaran rogi nai episodic yaaden nahin bana sakate hai kyonki hippocampus kaa sie 1 kshetra ghaav tha, or is prakaar hippocampus cortex se conection nahin bana sakaa
 Following an ischemic episode after surgery, an MRI of patient RB left his hippocampus intact, leaving a specific lesion restricted to CH1 pyramidal cells
 gaiyr-ghoshnaatmak jaankaree Some retrograde and anterograde amnesics are capable of non-declarative memory, including implicit learning and procedural learning
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch rogi swasth logon ke rup main chhadam yadrichhik anukram prayog main sudhaar dikhaate hai
 Therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for declarative memory
 ebbemarai adhyayanon ke mutabik, prakriyaatmak yaadon kaa adhigrahan basal gangliya, premotor cortex or poorak motor kshetra, kshetron ko sakriy karata he jo aam taur par ghoshnaatmak yaadon ke gathan se jude nahin hote hai
 This type of dissociation between declarative and procedural memory can also be found in patients with Korschoff syndrome, such as diencephalic amnesia
 kuch rogiyon dwaara pradarshit ek or udhaaharan, jaise ki ke
si
 or echem, jinke paas madhyakaalin asthaayee kshati or antrogred amenesia he, abhi bhi avadharanatmak priming he
 Those patients performed well in the term fragment completion test
 teen samanyikrut shreniyan hai jinamein ek vyakti dwaara bhulbhulaiya praapt kii ja sakati he
 The three categories are head trauma, traumatic events, or physical insufficiency
 adhikansh khushiyaan or sambandhit smriti mudde pehle do shreniyon se praapt hote hai kyonki ye adhik aam hai or tisare ko pehle kii upashrenee mana ja saktaa he
 Head trauma is a very wide range because it is related to any type of injury or active action toward the brain that can cause acidity
 retrogred or antrogred emnesia aksar is tarah kii ghatnaon se dekha jaataa he, donon ke kaaran kaa ek sateek udhaaharan electroshock therapy hoga, jo praptakarta rogi ke liye sankshep main donon kaa kaaran banataa he
 Traumatic events are more subjective
 dardanaak kya he is par nirbhar karata he ki vyakti ko dardanaak lagata he
 Regardless, a traumatic event is an event where something is disturbed that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with stress
 dardanaak ghatnaon ke kaaran hone vaali amliya kaa ek aam udhaaharan vighatnkaaree bhulbhulaiya he, jo tab hota he jab vyakti aisi ghatana ko bhul jaataa he jisane unhen gaharaai se pareshaan kiya he
 An example would be a person who forgets a fatal and graphic car accident involving their loved ones
 shaareerik kamien sir ke aghat se alag hai kyonki shaareerik kamien niskriy bhautik muddon kii ore adhik nirbhar karti hai
 Typical causes of amnesia are: Electroconvulsive therapy jisamen chikitsakeey prabhaav ke liye rogiyon main daure vidyut rup se prerit hote hai, donon pratikruti or antrogred amenesia sahit teevr prabhaav ho sakate hai
 Alcohol can both cause blackouts and have a detrimental effect on memory formation
 prakaar Anterograde amnesia is an inability to create new memories due to brain damage, whereas long-term memories are retained before the event
 mastishk kaa nuksaan dirghakaalik sharaab, gambhir kuposhan, stroke, sir aghat, anseflitis, surgery, varnikik-corsacof syndrome, cerebrovascular ghatnaon, anoksia yaa anya aghat ke prabhaavon ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 The two brain regions related to this condition are the medial temporal lobe and the medial diencephalon
 neuronal haani ke kaaran antrogred amenesia kaa aushadhiy tareekon se ilaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 However, treatment exists in educating patients to define their daily routines and after several stages they begin to benefit from their procedural memory
 isi tarah, antrogred amenesia peediton ke liye jivan kii gunvattta main sudhaar ke liye saamaajik or bhaavnaatmak samarthan mahatvapurn he
 Fentanyl use by opioid users has been identified as a possible cause in a group of cases in Boston, MA
 retrogred amenesia amliya kii shuruyaat se pehle yaadon ko yaad karne main asamarthta he
 One may be able to encode new memories after the event
 retrogred aam taur par hippocampus ke alaava mastishk ke kuch hisson main sir ke aghat yaa mastishk ke nuksaan ke kaaran hota he
 The hippocampus is responsible for new memory encoding
 episodic memory arthpurna smriti se prabhavit hone kii adhik sambhaavna he
 The damage is usually due to head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, stroke, tumor, hypoxia, encephalitis, or chronic alcoholism
 pratikruti amenesia se peedit logon ko vishistataaon ke bajaay saamaanya gyaan yaad rakhane kii adhik sambhaavna he
 Recent memories are less likely to be recovered, but becoming stronger over time will make it easier to remember old memories

 There are several extremely important case studies: Henry Molaison, R
B
, and G
D
 henry molison Henry Molaison, formerly known as HM, made people think of memory
 maamle kii pehali baar 1 9 57 main wiliam bichar scovil or brenda milanar dwaara ek paper main report kii gai thi
 He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy due to a bicycle accident at the age of nine
 chikitsak dawaaon ke saath apane daure ko niyantrit karne main asamarth the, isliye neurosrjan scovil ne mastishk surgery se jude ek nae drushtikon kii koshish kii
 He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by performing a temporal lobectomy
 unke mirgee main sudhaar hua, lekin molison ne nai dirghakaalik yaaden banane kii kshamta kho di
 They displayed normal short-term memory capacity
 agar unhen shabdon kii suchi di gai, to vah unhen lagbhag ek minute ke samay main bhul jaaenge
 In fact, he would forget that he was also given a list in the first place
 ek baar molison ne soochiyon ke bare main sochane se roak diya to vah unhen dirghakaalik smriti se phir se yaad karne main asamarth tha
 This gave evidence to researchers that short-term and long-term memory are actually two distinct processes
 bhale hi vah soochiyon ke bare main bhul gaya, phir bhi vah apni antarnihit smriti ke madhyam se chizon ko seekhney main sakasham tha
 Psychologists will ask them to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror
 haalanki vah kabhi bhi us kaary ko kabhi yaad nahin rakh saktaa tha, phir bhi vah baar-baar aisa karne ke baad sudhaar karegaa
 This showed psychologists that he was unconsciously learning and memorizing things
 amenesia ke bare main adhik jaanane ke liye adhyayan molison ke jivan bhar main lagaataar puraa ho gaye
 The researchers conducted a 14-year follow-up study on Molaison
 unhone apni bhulbhulaiya ke bare main or jaanane ke liye do saptaah kii avadhi ke liye adhyayan kiya
 After 14 years, Molaison still could not remember the things that happened after his surgery
 haalanki, vah abhi bhi un chizon ko yaad kar saktaa tha jo oparation se pehle hua tha
 Researchers also found that, when asked, Molaison could answer questions about national or international events, but could not recall his personal memories
 unki mrityu ke baad molison ne apane mastishk ko vigyaan main daan diya, jahaan ve mastishk ke un kshetron ko khojane main sakasham the jinke ghaavon main unki bhul hoti he
 This case study provided important insights for areas of the brain that are affected in anterograde amnesia, as well as how amnesia works
 rogi arabi Patient RB was a generally working person until the age of 52 years
 50 saal kii umr main, use angina kaa nidaan kiya gaya tha or do maukon par dil kii samasyaon ke liye surgery hui thi
 After a hyscic episode that arose from heart bypass surgery, RB showed a loss of anterograde memory with the exception of a few years before his surgery, but almost no loss of retrograde memory, and no sign of any other cognitive impairment
 Not presented unki mrityu ke baad tak shodhakartaaon ko apane dimag kii jaanch karne kaa mauka nahin mila, jab unhen pataa chalaa ki unke ghaav hippocampus ke sie 1 bhaag tak simit the
 This case study underwent significant research involving the role of the hippocampus and the function of memory
 rogi jidi Patient GD was a white male born in 1940 who served in the Navy
 unhen puraani gurde kii vifaltaa kaa nidaan kiya gaya tha or unke baaki ke jivan ke liye hemodialysis upachaar praapt hua tha
 In 1983, he went to the hospital for elective parathyroidectomy
 uske baayen lob main khun kii gambhir haani ke kaaran bhi usne thyride lobatomi choda tha
 As a result of the surgery he started having cardiac problems and became very agitated
 aspataal se reeha hone ke paanch din baad bhi vah yaad nahin kar paaya ki uske saath kya hua tha
 Apart from memory loss, none of his other cognitive processes were affected
 vah zyada shodh main shaamil nahin hona chahta tha, lekin doctoron ke saath memory pareekshanon ke madhyam se, ve yah pataa lagane main sakasham the ki unki mrityu kii samasya agle 9 
5 varshon tak unki mrityu tak maujuud thi

 He advised the sage to go to Vishnu
 rishi vishnu ke paas gaye
 When Vishnu also revealed his inability, he came to Shiva
 shiv ne jab rishi kii du:khagaatha suni to ve du:khee hue or unhone mani or mall ke vinaash ke liye martand bhairav kaa rup dhaaran kiya or kartikeya ke netritv main apane saat koti ganon ko lekar manichul parvat par pahunche
 He had a tumultuous war with mani-malla
 ant main martand bhairav ne mani ke vakshasthal ko videern kar diya or vah bhoomi par gir padaa
 Upon falling, he prayed to Shiva to allow him to be near her as a horse
 shiv ne uskaa anurodh sweekaar kar liya
 Similarly, before dying Malla also requested Martand Bhairav that in my name you should be known as Mallari
 tab saptrushi ne bhaymukt hokar martand bhairav se swayambhuling ke rup main prempur main rahane kaa anurodh kiya or unhone unka bhi anurodh maan liya

 He inspired his husbands to do sage Gautama
 un brahmanon ne iske nimitt bhagavan shriganeshji kii aradhana kii
 Pleased with his worship, Ganesha appeared and asked him to ask for the groom, those Brahmins said - 'prabhu! If you are happy with us then somehow get Rishi Gautama out of this ashram
 ' unki yah baat sunakar ganeshji ne unhen aisa var maangane ke liye samajhaayaa
 But he remained firm on his request
 antat ganeshji ko vivash hokar unki baat manani padi
 To keep the mind of his devotees, he took the form of a weak cow and started living in the field of sage Gautama
 gaay ko fasal charate dekhakar rishi badi narmi ke saath haath main trin lekar use haankane ke liye lapke
 As soon as those trunks were touched, that cow fell there itself
 ab to bada haahaakaar machaa
 All the Brahmins gathered and started denouncing the sage Gautama as a cow killer
 rishi gautam is ghatana se bahut aashcharyachakit or duhkhi the
 Now all those Brahmins said that you should leave this ashram and go somewhere else
 go-hatyare ke nikat rahane se hamen bhi paap lagegaa
 Being compelled, the sage Gautama started living with his wife Ahilya a curse away from there
 kintu un brahmanon ne vahaan bhi unka rahanaa dubhar kar diya
 They started saying - 'now you have no right to do the work of Vedas and Yajnadi due to cow slaughter
 ' atyant anunay bhav se rishi gautam ne un brahmanon se prarthana kii ki aap log mere praayshchit or uddhaar kaa koi upaay bataaen
 Then he said- 'gautam! You can revolve the whole earth thrice by telling your sins everywhere to everyone
 phir lautakar yahan ek maheene tak vrath karo
 After this, after doing 101 circumambulation of 'brahmagiri' you will be purified or bring Gangaji here and bathe with water and worship Shiva with one crore earthly Shivalingas
 iske baad punah gangaji main snaan karke is brahmagiri kii 11 baar parikrama karo
 Then bathing the earthly Shivalingas with the holy water of hundred pots will save you
 brahmanon ke kathananusaar maharishi gautam ve saare kaary puure karke patni ke saath purnatah tallin hokar bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana karne lage
 Pleased with this, Lord Shiva appeared and asked him to ask for the groom
 maharishi gautam ne unase kaha- 'bhagavan main yahi chahta hoon ki aap mujhe go-hatya ke paap se mukt kar den
 'lord Shiva said-' Gautam! You are completely sinless
 go-hatya kaa aparaadh tum par chal purvak lagaaya gaya tha
 i want to punish the Brahmins of your ashram who have done this deceitfully
 ' On this Maharishi Gautam said that Lord! i have received your darshan for his sake only
 ab unhen meraa paramahit samajhakar un par aap krodh na karen
 Many sages, sages and devas gathered there, approving Gautam's talk and prayed to Lord Shiva to stay there forever

 vibhinn vidwaanon ne chikitsakeey samaaj kaary ko paribhaashit karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 According to Professor Rajaram Shastri: ‘‘chikitsakeey samaaj kaary swasth evam chikitsakeey dekharekh ke kshetra main samaajakaarya kii paddatiyon evam darshan kaa upyog evam sweekaran he
 Medical social work describes and elaborates the aspects of social work knowledge and methods that are particularly suitable for the help of people suffering from health and medical problems
 ’’ According to Professor HS Pathak: "medical social work is concerned with providing support to patients who are unable to use the available therapies effectively due to social and psychological factors
 " Based on the analysis and integration of appropriate definitions, medical social work can be explained in the following words
 chikitsakeey samaaj kaary, samaaj kaary kii ek nav viksit shakha he, jo un saamaajik, shaareerik tathaa manovaigyanik prakriyaaon par kendritahai jo biimaar kii beemaari se sambandhit he
 Therefore, the job of a medical social worker is to provide various types of support to the sick, caring for the system of treatment of the disease and the sick and makes them available to the patient whatever means are available for their fulfillment, but as a result of this arrangement Its function is also limited to a particular aspect of the disease
 vah pahalu sirf or sirf saamaajik he
 He tries to solve those social causes
 jo bhi rogi ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Medical social work, as a branch of social work, is based on the belief of the importance of the individual

 atah chikitsakeey saamaajik kaaryakarta rogiyo ke sahaayta ke liye kaarykram kaa nirdhaaran karte samay, in sabhi saamaajik, aarthik tathaa manovaigyanik karkon par bhalee prakaar vichaar karata he vastavamein manushya, man tathaa sharir kii ekta he or aushadhi ko is ekta kaa vichaar karnaa chahie
 Anatomy, chemistry and biology alone cannot explain the complications of disease
 man tathaa sharir kii baadhaon ko ek-duusare se pruthak nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This branch also has different orientation like the specific branches of social work
 It emphasizes more on the practical side of the subject and differs from other branches due to its subject matter
 Its boundaries are extraordinary
 parinaam swaroop chikitsa samaaj vigyaan ke vikaas main adwitiya evam vishisht siddhanton ke vikaas na karne kaa koi prashn hi nahin uthta he
 If medical social science is developed on its theoretical basis
 to iske dwaara saamaanya samaaj vigyaan bhi avashya prabhavit hogi
 The role of medical society scientists can be found in social organization, deviant behavior, social control, adjustment and other common sociological interests
 vidwaanon ke matanusaar : ‘‘chikitsa kshetra main unheen kaa yogadan ho saktaa he jo unke avadharanatmak unmeshon se saamaajik parivartan laane kii baat karte he
 '' ‘‘chikitsa jagat main samaaj vaigyaniko kaa vaigyanik anusandhantabhi mahatvapurn ho saktaa he jab samaaj vaigyanik ansandhan main bhi unki dakshata ho
 "only then can researchers of other disciplines make significant contributions in the field of health

 Along with this, it is also provided training facilities

 In addition, the opportunity to do practical work is provided

 However, since 1946, efforts have been made to help patients in medical treatment and alleviation on the basis of skills based on professional social work

 In medical science, less attention is paid to the psycho-social conditions of the patient i
e
 till that time it is not accepted that psycho-social conditions play an important role in getting the disease free of the patient
 In principle, the role of social work in the medical field was accepted in principle
 1946 mumbai ke je0 je 0 aspataal main sarvapratham chikitsakeey samaajakaaryakarta kii niyukti kii gai
 Later, a social worker was appointed in KEM

 Dr
 Dhuriye Committee also clarified that at least one social worker should be appointed in every hospital in the country
 yadi is sanstuti kaa kaarynvyan kiya gaya hota to aaj jo sthiti he vah na hoti
 Today there is no appointment of a social worker in the district hospital
 50 bed vaale kya 500 bed vaale bade aspataal main bhi ek chikitsakeey samaaj kaaryakarta kii aavashyaktaa he
 The history of medical social work in India is short-lived and at the same time its field is very limited
 Another situation is that most of the employed workers are untrained
 Initially it is probably the case that social work is not accessible in medical social work and other It has also been possible not to accept them as medical institutions, but continue to take them as usual
 isprakaar se samaaj kaaryakarta se unki apeksha ati nimna hoti he
 Sometimes, they do the work of guiding the patients or do the correspondence on behalf of medicine
 yaa karyaalay ke kaary main hi sambandh kar dete he
 Therefore, after studying these forms, it is necessary that there should be a clear interpretation of their qualifications in medicine
 This can happen when a social worker is trained in medicine
 dhuriye came tii kii sanstuti ke aadhaar par hi sabhi 50 bed vaale aspataalo main samaaj kaaryakarta kii niyukti kar dena chahie gaiyr sarkari sansthaaon main chikitsakeey samaaj kaary karta kaa atyant simit kshetra he
 It is also necessary for the recognition of social work that doctors should not be given a normal status for social work in the work of medical studies so that in practice they can also accept social worker

 This is an auspicious feature of the Department of Social Work, but the appointment in this direction is also limited to only five or six institutions
 atah samaaj chikitsa main samaaj kaaryakarta niyukt anivaary kar deni chahie
 Similarly, appointment of social worker should be made mandatory in public health, family planning, community work as well
 yah sthiti bharat sarkaar nishchit kar de to samaaj kaaryakarta kii niyukti main sudhaar main vruddhi hogi

 The shampoo, when dissolved in water creates foam, acts as a surfactant and can also remove natural oils that make hair smooth when it cleanses hair and scalp
 shampoo ke prayog ke baad aksar condishnar ko baalo main lagaaya jaataa he, jo baalo ko kadhana or unki sajja karnaa sugam banaata he
 The word shampoo is originally derived from the Hindi word chapo which means head massage
 yah shabd or avadharana donon hi britain main aupniveshik kaal main bharat dwaara pesh kiye gayi the
 The term and service was introduced by a Bengali entrepreneur Sheikh Din Mahmood in Britain in 1814 when he, along with his Irish wife, opened a shampoo bath called 'mahmud's Indian Vapor Bath' in Brighton England
 uskaa snaan turki snaan, kii tarah tha jahaan graahakon ko champi yaa chikitsaatmak maalish ek bhartiya upachaar kii tarah di jaati thi
 His service was greatly appreciated and he was appointed as the Shimpu physician for both George IV and William IV
 1900 main, shabd kaa arth kii maalish se badalakar baalo ko sabun lagaana ho gaya
 Earlier, common soap was used to wash hair
 lekin baalo main rah gaya sabun baalo ko sanvarna asuvidhajanak, pareshaani bharaa banaata tha saath hi bal aswasth bhi lagate the
 During the initial phase of the shampoo, the British used to boil hair soap mixed with grated soap and then herbs were added to it to give shine and fragrance to the hair
 kisi hebert pehle gyaat nirmaataa hai jinhone pehle shampoo kaa nirmaan kiya
 Earlier soaps and shampoos were similar products, both containing surfactants which is a type of detergent
 aadhunik shampoo 1930 ke dashak main astitv main aayaa, jo pehla synthetic shampoo tha
 In India, traditional hair massage is still common and various oils and herb formulations are used for this
 neem, shikaakai, reetha, mehandi, bel, brahmi, methi, chacha, aanwala, musbbar, haldi or baadaam jise chandan, chameli, gulab or kasturi jaise kuch sugandh ghatakon ke sangyojan ke saath istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Ghantaghar Dehradun is a Ghantaghar located in Dehradun, the capital of Uttarakhand state of India
 iskaa nirmaan british shashan kaal ke dauraan angrezo dwaara karavaaya gaya tha
 This bell is of hexagonal shape with six clocks on six faces at the top, although these clocks are not in working condition
 dehradun kaa yah ghantaghar bina ghantanad kaa sabase bada ghantaghar he
 Its hexagonal structure is rare in Asia of its type
 yah ghantaghar eenton or pattharon se nirmit he or iske shatkoniya aakaar kii har diwaar par praveshmarg bana hua he
 The staircase in its center leads to its upper floor with semicircular windows
 dehradun kaa ghantaghar nagar main sabase soundaryapurna sanrachana he
 This Ghantaghar is located at the mouth of the busiest Rajpur Road of Dehradun and is the center of major business activities here
 ghantaghar ko duuri se bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Previously, the Ghantagad of Ghantaghar was also audible from far off places in Dehradun, but now this Ghantaghar is only a landmark of Dehradun, now around which shops, cinemas, government buildings, tourist places etc
 have been built
 sanathan dharm: apane mul rup hindu dharm ke vaikalpik naam se janaa jaataa he
 In the Vedic period, the name 'sanatan Dharma' is found for the religion of the Indian subcontinent
 'sanathan' kaa arth he - shaashvat yaa 'hameshaa bana rahane vaala', arthath jiskaa na aadi he na ant
 Sanatan Dharma is basically Indian religion, which was spread all over Greater India at one time
 vibhinn kaarnon se hue baari dharmantaran ke baad bhi vishwa ke is kshetra kii bahusankhyak aabaadi isi dharm main aasthaa rakhti he
 Residents across the Indus River were called Iranians by Hindus, who used to pronounce 'H'
 unki dekha-dekhi arab hamalavar bhi tatkaaleen bharatvasiyon ko hindu or unke dharm ko hindu dharm kehane lage
 The word Hindu is found in India's own literature some 1000 years ago, not before that
 hindutv sanathan dharm ke rup main sabhi dharmon kaa muladhar he kyonki sabhi dharm-siddhanton ke saarvbhaum aadhyatmik satya ke vibhinn pahaluon kaa isamen pehle se hi samavesh kar liya gaya tha
 —rigveda-3-18-1 sanathan dharm jise hindu dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kaha jaataa he, kaa 1960853110 saal kaa itihaas hai
 Many signs of Hinduism are found in the Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, ling, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 In ancient times, there were five sects in Indian Sanatana Dharma called Gaanapatya, Shaivadeva: Koti Vaishnav, Shakta and Saura
 gaanpaty ganeshaki, vaishnav vishnu kii, shaivadev:koti shiv kii, shakt shakti kii or saura surya kii puja aradhana kiya karte the
 But it was believed that all are interpretations of the same truth
 yah na keval rugveda parantu ramayana or mahabharat jaise lokapriy granthon main bhi spasht rup se kaha gaya he
 The supporters of each sect considered their deity to be greater than the deity of other sects and for this reason there was disharmony among them
 ekta banaae rakhane ke uddeshy se dharmaguruon ne logon ko yah shiksha dena armbh kiya ki sabhi devtaa samaan hai, vishnu, shiv or shakti aadi devi-devtaa paraspar ek duusare ke bhi bhakt hai
 These teachings matched their three sects and originated the Sanatan Dharma
 sanathan dharm main vishnu, shiv or shakti ko samaan mana gaya or teenon hi sampradaay ke samarthak is dharm ko maanane lage
 All literature of Sanatan Dharma has been composed in Sanskrit language like Vedas, Puranas, Shruti, Smriti, Upanishads, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Gita etc
 kaalaantar main bharatvarsh main musalmaan shashan ho jane ke kaaran devbhasha sanskrit kaa hraas ho gaya tathaa sanathan dharm kii avnati hone lagi
 To rectify this situation, the scholar Saint Tulsidas protected Sanatan Dharma by composing religious literature in the prevailing language
 jab aupniveshik british shashan ko isai, muslim aadi dharmon ke maanane waalon kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karne ke liye janaganana karne kii aavashyaktaa padi to sanathan shabd se aparichit hone ke kaaran unhone yahan ke dharm kaa naam sanathan dharm ke sthaan par hindu dharm rakh diya
 'sanatan Dharma' is the real name of Hinduism
 satya do dhaatuon se milakar bana he sat or tat
 This means Sat and Tat means that
 donon hi satya he
 Ego Brahmasmi and Tattvamsi
 arthath main hi brahm hoon or tum hi brahm ho
 This entire world is cosmic
 brahm purna he
 This world is also complete
 purna jagat kii utpatti purna brahm se hui he
 There is no inferiority in the perfection of Brahm even when the whole world is created from the complete Brahman
 vah shesh rup main bhi purna hi rahata he
 This is the eternal truth
 sanathan main aadhunik or samasamyik chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye isamen samay samay par badlaav hote rahe hai, jaise ki raja ram mohan raay, swami dayanand, swami vivekanand aadi ne sati pratha, bal vivaah, asprishyata jaise asuvidhajanak paramparaagat kuritiyon se asahaj mahasoos karte rahe
 Those Shloko-mantras present in the roots of these evils were called "kshepaks" or changed their meanings and declared them to be sacrosanct and revived many old traditions like widow marriage, women education etc
 yadhyapi aaj sanathan kaa paryaay hindu he par buddha, jain dharmavalambi bhi apane aap ko sanatani kehete hai, kyonki buddha bhi apane ko sanatani kehete hai
 Even atheists who follow Charvak philosophy are Sanatani
 sanathan dharmi ke liye kisi vishisht paddati, karmkand, veshbhusha ko maananaa jaruri nahin
 He is born in a Sanatanadharmi family, believes in any philosophy like Vedanta, Mimamsa, Charvak, Jain, Buddhist, etc
 It is enough for him to be Sanatani
 sanathan dharm kii gutthiyon ko dekhte hue kai baar ise kathin or samajhane main mushkil dharm samajha jaataa he
 However, the truth is not such, yet it has so many dimensions, so many aspects that people often get confused about it
 sabase bada kaaran iskaa yah ki sanathan dharm kisi ek darshanik, manisha yaa rishi ke vichaaron kii upaj nahin he, na hi yah kisi khaas samay paidaa hua
 It has been flowing and evolving since time immemorial
 saath hi yah keval ek drushtaa, siddhant yaa tark ko bhi variyata nahin detaa
 When science evaluates every object, idea and element, in the process, many beliefs and principles of religion collapse
 vigyaan bhi sanathan satya ko pakadaney main abhi tak kaamyaab nahin hua he kintu vedant main ullekith jis sanathan satya kii mahima kaa varnan kiya gaya he vigyaan dhire-dhire usase sahamat hota najar aa rahaa he
 Our sages and sages had expressed it clearly by knowing the mystery of Brahma, the universe and the soul in a deep state of meditation and salvation
 vedon main hi sarvapratham brahm or brahmad ke rahasy par se pardaa hataakar 'moksh' kii dharna ko pratipaadit kar uske mahatv ko samajhaayaa gaya tha
 Without salvation, there is no movement of the soul, that is why the sages have considered the path of salvation as the eternal path
 hindu athwa sanathan · buddha · sikh · jain · islam · anya Teyyam is a major worship ritual in the North Malabar region of Kerala
 yah anushthan, mukhya rup main kolt -nad ilaake me or karnataka ke kodagu or tulu nadu ilaake main ek jite-jaagate panth ke rup me hazaron saal puraani reeti or vidhion se nishpadit kiya jaataa he
 The performers of the Tayyam are members of the lower castes of the society and they have a special contribution in this form
 in ilaakon ke log, theyyam ko bhagwaan ke praturup maanate hai or inase aashirwad lete he
 In Tulu Nadu area it is called Bhoot-kol
 aitihaasik keralotpatti ke hisaab se, parashuram ne hi kaliattem, poorvela or daiwattem athwa teyyattem jaisi kalaroopon ko uttar malbar me sthapit kii thi
 He was the one who entrusted the execution of Teyyam in tribal communities like Malair, Panan, Vanan, Velar
 yah anushthan jisamen chadhaave ke rup me sharaab, maance aadi kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, mandiron main namboodiri brahmanon dwaara kiye gaye sattvik anushthanon ke saath astitv kaa daawa leti he
 Always sponsored by ruling classes such as the Nair community, Teyyam and other Sattvik festivals were celebrated in a similar manner
 theyyam dravidon kii kalaroop he
 There is also a revolutionary hypothesis behind the Teyyam, that even the upper caste people have to worship the eminent God in the form of the Teyam, due to which the Teyyam is against the caste system of Kerala
 theyyam kii utpatti kaa shrey manakkaden gurukkal ko diya jaataa he 
 He was a prominent artist of the "vannan" caste
 kaha jaataa he ki chirkkal pradesh ke raja ne ek baar unke jaadui shaktiyon kii pariksha karne ke liye apane raaj- sabha main nimantrit kiya
 Gurukkal lived in Manakkad area of karivellur region
 unki yatra ke bich raja ne unki pariksha karne ke liye kai rukaawaton kaa intejaam kar liya tha
 But Gurukkal, with his powers, passed all the examinations and came before the king
 gurukkal kii shaktiyon se prabhavit hokar raja ne unako, kuch devataaon ke poshaak banane kaa uttardaayitv saunp di, jinke prayog karke anushthaneey nrityon kaa aayojan karnaa tha
 Gurukkal made 35 different dresses before sunrise
 unke prabhutv se prabhavit hokar raja ne gurukkal ko "manakkadn " kii oopaadhi pradaan kii
 This is the history behind the present form of Teyyam
 theyyam panth kii mukhya dhara ko pracheen, adivasee tathaa dharmik pujaaon ne chauda bana diya he or parinaam swaroop lakhon kaa lok-dharm bana diya he
 In the example, the cult of Bhagwati Teyyam, which is worshiped in the maternal form of the goddess, is derived from the original form of the goddess
 iske alaava atmaaon kii puja, naag- puja, vriksh- puja, vir- puja, gram-devtaa kii puja aadi theyyam panth kii mul dhara main maujuud he
 Along with these deities, many folk-gods are also included
 deviyon kaa theyyam bhagwati ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The diverse branches of Hinduism such as Vaishnavisam, Shaivism and Shaktisam dominate the cult of Teyyam today
 kuch kendron main, handav, baudd, jain aacharon ke khilaaf hone par bhi jaanwaron kii bali chadhai jaati he
 In these centers, each of the areas planned from the original temples is sacrificed and a traditional "pen" is built, called Vadakkanwatil
 akasar murgon kii ladai bhi yojit kii jaati he
 In the name of blood sacrifice, this fight of the hens is a testimony to the combination of small and big cultures
 anushthan ke pratham vidhi ko tottem kahte he, jisame nishpadak saral se poshaak main saral se alankaar main, mandir ke garbh-grah ke saamne khadey hokar devtaa ke kisson kaa gaan karte he yaa alp shringaar ke saath theyyam se jude hue aitihya par aadhaarit joshilay nrity kaa pradarshan karte he
 After this exhibition called "tottam Pate", the executioners bid farewell to preparing the main verb
 yah taiyaari shuru hoti he, mukh kii shringaar se, jisamen, har ek rekha kii alag hi matlab hoti he or khatm hoti he vistrut poshaak ke pahnaav se
 Shirobhushan, the holiest fact of the dress, is worn by the statue of the deity idol, with traditional instruments the artist sees his reflection in the mirror
 yah is kalaroop kaa atyant mahatvapurn evam pratikatmak muhoort he, kyonki kalakaar aaine main apana pratibimb hi nahin, balki us daivi shakti ko bhi mahsoos karata he, jiskaa vah pratik he
 As the ritual progresses, the artist, dressed in traditional attire and ornamentation, races around the temple, dances, blesses the devotees with the rhythm of "chenda"
 aashirwad deni ke avasar par kalakaar, daivi style main pravachan detaa he, jo uske aam dhang ke baatcheet se vibhinn hota he
 During this process, a divine atmosphere is created
 har ek theyyam kii poshaak evam mukh-alankaar uske aitihya evam kahani par nirbhar hoti he, jo us prayek theyyam ke bhav-style ke bare main hamen soochna detii he
 Using a variety of color materials, the artists themselves prepare their dress
 zyada tar poshaak, nariyal patton ke aavarnon ko kaatane ke baad, kaale, laal or safed lagaake banaae jate he, jisapar anek chitra banaae jate he
 Aanchal is made with fresh tables, breasts are made from hollow coconut shells and a red cloth is covered at the waist
 theyyam ghar ke yaa kshetreey mandir ke aangan main, kul devtaa ke aashirwadon ke saath, saamanytah, raatri kaal main anushthit kiya jaataa he
 Mouth-armor, ornamentation, breast-armor, kankana, garland etc
 are made with immense reverence
 theyyam roopon main sabase lok priy he, muthappan, ti chamundi, kandakarnan, gulicon, vishnumurti, muchhilot bhagavti aadi
 Of these, Ti Chamundi is considered very risky because in this form, Teyyam creates a divine atmosphere by dancing in fire-eyes
 kheda agra prakhand, agra, uttar pradesh sthit ek gaanv he
 a vapor or boiler is a closed vessel in which water or any other liquid is heated
 isamen garam karne se utpann vaashp ko baahar nikaalane kii samuchit vyavastha bhi hoti he jisase vaashp ko vibhinn prakramon yaa garm karne ke liye upyog main laayaa ja sake
 Its design is such that at least heat is wasted on heating and it can also bear the pressure of vapor
 isamen garam kiya hua yaa vashpikrut taral ko nikaalkar vibhinn prakramon main yaa ooshmeekaran ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he, jaise- jal kaa ooshmeekaran, kendriya ooshmeekaran, vashpak-aadhaarit shakti-utpaadan, bhojan banane or safai aadi ke liye
 The mention of boilers has been seen in the history of Europe since the time of the empires of Greece and Rome, but their modern form has developed very slowly
 shakti utpaadan karne ke liye vaashp kaa upyog 19veen shatabdi se aarambh hua, lekin jab trevithik ne ucch daab ke vaashp kaa upyog apane injanon main kiya, isse pehle boyler kaa koun sa ang kitna majboot or kis dhaatu kaa ho isaki ore kisi kaa dhyaan nahin gaya tha
 By the early days of the nineteenth century, people who built boilers for any purpose would either make their own shape, according to their available means and facilities, or according to the place where they were to be seated
 aarambh main boyler taanbe kii chaadaron se or baad main pitwein lohe se banane lage
 The best shape of the boiler should be round in terms of strength and pressure, but there are great difficulties and difficulties in making water vapor by making it perfect, to sit steadily, and to make the heat of the fire reach the maximum amount of water
 
 majbootee kii drushti se golakaar ke baad duusari sabase uttam akruti belanaakaar he
 Thus, since steam is used for power generation, boilers are made cylindrical, whether they are made as a single drum or as a joint of several drums, or as a joint of drums and several tubes
 boyleron ke banane or sanchaalan ke nimitt, janata kii suraksha or boyleron kii kaaryakshmata kii drushti se ek alag shaastra hi ban gaya he, jiske kuch aavashyak vaigyanik niyam rajyon ke vidhaan main bhi aa gaye hai
 Every user of boilers is obliged to follow them
 boyleron ko unki banaavat ke anusaar do mukhya virgon main baanta jaataa he : Cornish boilers are the oldest type of fire-tube boilers
 isaki banaavat bahut hi saral hoti he, jiske kaaran yah aajkal bhi kaam main aata he
 It consists of a single smoke pipe, in the front of which a furnace is made
 aajkal yah boyler choti badi kai maapon main banaaya jaataa he
 Its smallest measure is four feet in diameter by 10 feet in length and the thickest measurement is 6 feet 6 inches in diameter and 24 feet in length
 isamen ek hi bhatthi or dhoomravahini hoti he, at: badi maap ke boyler main koyala thik prakaar se nahin jal paata or uske brihad aakaar ke anupaat se uskaa tapt dharaatal bhi kam rahata he
 Therefore, by making two furnaces equal in a Cornish type boiler, the same becomes called Lancashire boiler
 inaki anya banaavatein ek si hi hoti hai
 The smallest Lancashire boiler has a diameter of 5 feet, 6 inches and a length of 16 feet, and the largest has a diameter of 10 feet and a length of 30 feet
 anek baar isamen teen bhatthiyaan bhi bana di jaati hai
 Cornish and Lacashire boilers typically have a vapor pressure of up to 180 pounds per square inch
 in donon prakaar ke boyleron ko ant: prajvalit boyler bhi kah sakate hai, vaise to inamen agni kii jwalaaye bhatthi ke peeche kii taraf se ghumkar boyler ko baahar kii taraf se bhi tapaati hai
 In Cornish and Lancashire boilers, even with more than one furnace and large diameter smoke, their heated surface does not grow at will
 at: is uddeshy kii purti ke liye kai prakaar ke boyleron main badi agninalikaay lagane ke badale chote vyas kii anek dhumr nalikaay laga di jaati hai, jinke kaaran boyler bahunalika boyler kehalaate hai
 It can be both externally ignited and internal ignited
 bahyat: prajvalit boyler un vanya pradhan kshetron main kaam main laae jate hai jahaan jangalon main hi lakdi chirane kii aara mashine baithai jaati hai
 They are quite small in size and are portable
 is kaaran inhen le jaakar iton kii buniyadi bhatthi par rakh kar kaam chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Within the drum of the ignited boilers, one or two fire-tube furnaces and their ignition chamber are built into the foundation of the bricks, the hot gases from the back are returned from the chimney to the front of the chimney
 yah boyler drybac naam se prasiddh he
 Among the boilers, a boiler called Elephant, or Tischibin, is more commonly used in Europe
 isamen do athwa adhik dhol ek duusare ke upar neeche lage rahete hai or unka paraspar sambandh bade vyas ke chote nalon dwaara hota he
 The upper drum may or may not have thin tubes, but the lower drum must have a furnace and thin thin nozzles
 isi prakaar ke boyler kaa parishkrut rup jahaji kaamon ke liye bhi banaaya gaya he, jise scoch boyler kehete hai
 It has incorporated all the qualities of the above boilers
 lekin iskaa prajvalanakaksh purnataya boyler ke bheetar hi he, at: isamen kisi prakaar kii iton kii chinai nahin kerani padati
 The ignition boilers which are made for small tasks of running pumps etc
 are often standing boilers
 inhen cocktan boyler kehete hai
 Such standing boilers are fitted with two thick water tubes, called Galloway tubes
 jalanaliyon ke laabhon kaa varnan aage kiya gaya he
 The boiler of a rail engine is only ignited with ignition, but nowadays it is customary to install 2-4 nozzles in its furnace
 is prakaar ke boyleron main chote aakaar ke khadey boyleron ko chhod kar, jinka ullekh upar kiya ja chukaa he, anya sab jalanalika boyler bahyat: prajvalit hote hai
 They are often divided into three categories: * in which the drainage tubes are tilted from the horizon floor, pratham do shreniyon main to jal kaa pravaah swat: hi garmi kii parivahankriya dwaara hota rahata he, lekin tritiy shrenee ke boyleron main kisi pump kii sahaayta se balpurvak pravaah chaalu rakhaa jaataa he
 All waterborne, externally ignited boilers have vapors and water drums at the top and bottom respectively, which are interconnected by one or more numbers of small or large diameter vessels
 uuparavaale dholon main vaashp, athwa pani or vaashp, donon kaa mishran rahata he or nichevale dhol main keval pani or kabhi kabhi gadha pani or keechad bhi rahata he
 This drum is also called Madandram
 vibhinn dholo kii nalikaaon ke parsparik sambandh main vividhta rahane ke kaaran in boyleron ke kai varg ban jate hai
 The baycock-wilcox boiler is considered to be the best in waterborne boilers
 isamen chaar inch vyas kii nalikaaon kii shreniyan hederon main donon taraf se lagaakar, unke siron ko phula diya jaataa he or phir in hederon ke upar kii taraf lagi chaar inch vyas kii hi, lekin kam lambaai kii, naaliyon ko usee prakaar se baith kar, unke upree siron ko vaashp dhol main baitaakar, neeche kii nalikashreniyon ke puure jaal ko dhol se aage or peeche kii ore se sambandhit kar diya jaataa he
 The rear headers are connected to the bottom of the tank, collecting sludge and very condensed water as the boiler works, which is conveniently removed
 sthaliy boyleron main vaashp pani ke dhol ko naliyon kii lambaai kii disha main rakhaa jaataa he or jahaji boyleron main aadaa bhi rakh sakate hai
 There are two variations from the aqueous boiler described earlier
 is boyler kii naliyon kaa bahari vyas lagbhag shinch hota he or ve chah chah inchon ke antar par hederon se ek hi ore se judi hai or unka muda hua bhaag adhar main latakta rahata he, jis kaaran pani kaa pravaah ek hi disha main hota he
 Between these thin tubes there is another regional tube, from which the water flowing from one category of tubes goes to the regional tube and then enters another category
 is boyler kaa upyog kaarkaanon ke alaava jahaji kaamon main adhik hota he
 It is more publicized in the French fleet
 germany main bhi jahaji karmon ke liye isi se miltaa julata ek boyler banaaya gaya tha, jise durr boyler kehete hai
 In this boiler, two or three steamers are applied upwards and two or one water drum is attached to them by twisted water tubes, then it is called alpha boiler
 sidhi jalanalikaay lagane se kai laabh hote hai : pratham to vaayu kaa vyarodh badi saralata se kiya ja saktaa he; duusare sidhi nalikaaon ko aavashyaktaanusaar jis lambaai kii bhi chahen katkar lagaaya ja saktaa he, at: stock main phaltu naliyaan nahin rakhni padati; tisare pariksha karte samay naliyon kii pariksha dhol ke bheetar ghuskar saralata se kii ja sakati he or unhen badla bhi ja saktaa he
 These boilers are counted in ship boilers, which are famous for vertical tubes
 isaki sab jalanalikaay sidhi hi hai or neeche ke dhol belanaakaar hone ke badale di aakaar ke hai
 In the Thorncroft boiler, the outward duct range is somewhat curved
 aajkal audyogic kshetra main injanon, tarabinon tathaa anya prakaar ke yantron or prakriyaaon main vaashp kaa kharchaa itnaa adhik hota he ki saadhaaran boyler us aavashyaktaa ko puri karne main asamarth rahete hai
 The Yarrow and Stirling boilers, which we have described above, became a little more useful for large factories and power houses with a few changes , because of the reforms, they contained coal scavengers, oil and iron-fired furnaces
 Also started being lit
 phir bhi ve aadhunik kshetron main pichad gaye, kyonki jahaji kaamon ke liye to 575 pound prati varg inch daab kaa vaashp, jiskaa unchaa taap 399° sein
 ho, kaaphi samajha jaataa he
 If yarrow and sterling boilers make two million pounds of vapor per hour at the same pressure and heat, it is considered quite, but terrestrial factories and power houses have 1,000 pounds per square inch and sometimes even higher pressure vapor than five More than a million pounds per hour is spent
 at: dhol or jalanalikayukta boyleron ke badale adhiktar jalanalikayukta kuch aise upkaran banaae jane lage hai, jinamein dhol to nammaatr ke liye vaashp sanchit karne ke nimitt hi lagaaya jaataa he
 There is no longer any similarity between the shape of their and old boilers, hence they are called steam generators
 bhaapajanitr main vishuddh asut jal kaa panpon ke bal se patali patali naliyon main parivahan or unheen main vashpikaran bhi hota he
 This type of boilers are made in the form of a large closet, with walls made of fire bricks lining the water channels inside them with a very large fraction of the heat emitted by radiation from the furnace flames
 Absorbs and the remaining heat is absorbed by the sloping water bodies and boiler drums as necessary
 isi prakaar ke vuu vashpajanitr naamak ek bhimkarma vashpajanitr main koyale kii bukani jalaai jaati he
 It has been designed and built by the Combustion Engineering Corporation of New York and the Combustion Generator Companies of London
 yah 800 pound prati varg inch kii daab par 75 hajaar pound se lekar chaar lakh pound prati ghanta vaashp kaa utpaadan karanevaala banaaya ja saktaa he
 Its furnace is a closet, with a layer of uncluttered drainage around the walls
 is prajvalanakaksh ke chaaron konon par, neeche kii ore, koyale kii bukani sampeedit garam hawa se mishrit kar, balpurvak phuhaaron dwaara chodi jaati he
 In the form of a whirlwind of great fire, the burning gas rises up and enters the area of primary supernatant passing through the middle of the tubes near the ceiling of this ignition chamber and from there, through the door of the damper
 Entering supernatant enters, from which the gas flowing in the downward direction revolves in the diaphragm and rises upwards
 yadi mitopayojak laga ho, to gas usamen se hoti hui chimney main se baahar nikal jaati he
 This type of vaporizer occupies the least amount of space, but can produce more and more powerful vapor
 inamen atomos, benson, lamont, lowelar, suljar monotub or wilox prasiddh hai
 These too can be divided into two categories
 lowelar, lamont or viloks kii ginati ek shrenee main hoti he or benson tathaa suljar monotub kii ginati duusari shrenee main hoti he
 It was made by the John Tomson Company of Bulwer Hampton, England, to produce superheat vapor, which produces 1,000 pounds per square inch of vapor in many power houses in England, but nothing in its design Due to the low pressure vapor in it, it cannot be used
 is vashpajanitr main koyale kii bukani athwa tel eendhan kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The main part of the evaporator is the vapor and hydroelectric drum, from which water enters the bottom pumps due to its gravity
 yah pump is pani ko mulaayam ispaat kii bani jalavitarak sheershikaaon main mukhya dholak kii daab se lagbhag 35 pound prati varg inch kii atirikt daab par, bhej dete hai
 The number of these headings can also be more or less according to the composition and strength of the vaporizer
 yadi vashpajanitr nimna koti kii daab par kaam karata he, tab to sheershikaaon kii kaat ytaakar banaai jaati hai or yadi ucch daab par kaam karata he to sheershikaaon kii kaat gol banaai jaati he
 Upon reaching the headings, the water enters the evaporation tubes, whose mouths are formed in the form of ridges within the headings in such a way that the same amount of water can enter them as the amount of water that the tube can absorb

 sibar suraksha ,computer suraksha yaa IT suraksha kaa arth computer system ko chori se roke or uske hardware, softver or jaankariyon ko nuksaan hone se bachaane ke saath-saath uske sevaao ke vighatan or gumraah hone se bachaane se sambandhit he | In cyber security, the hardware prevents damage to the circuit board's entry into the program as well as to the network, data and code injection
 And this can also be due to misuse of the operator, whether they have done it intentionally or by mistake
 IT security is highly susceptible to deviating from secure processes through various methods
 computer system or internet ,wireles network jaise bluethud tathaa wifai par babbti nirbharta ke kaaran is kshetra kaa mahatv har saal badhata ja rahaa he | smart upkarnon kaa vikaas jaise samart phone ,television or chote chote upkaran internet of things ke bhaag he | The technologies of computer security are based on logic
 adhikansh computer Application ke liye suraksha aavashyak rup se praathmik lakshya nahin hoti he, lekin suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kisi kaarykram ko banaae jane se aksar hi us kaarykram ke vyavhaar main roak lag jaati he
 There are 4 methods of security in computing, sometimes a combination of methods is valid: anek pranaliyaan anjaane main pehali sambhaavna main aa jaaya karti hai
 The use of the second method is very limited, being expensive and non-deterministic
 pehali or teesri paddatiyaan vifal ho jaati hai
 The fourth method is more practical because it is based on hardware mechanisms and because of the avoidance of cheek-imagery and the diversity of degrees of freedom
 do patali paraton or chaar moti paraton ke saath starit banaavat main duusari tathaa chauthi paddatiyon ke sangyojan kaa aksar upyog hua karata he
 a variety of strategies and techniques are used to design a security system
 haalanki taiyaar karne ke baad suraksha ko badhaane ke liye kuch, yadi koi ho, prabhavi ranneetiyaan hoti hai
 a technique to force too much of the principle of less convenience provides force, where an entity has the privilege to perform its own tasks
 
 is tarah agar koi ghuspaithiya pranali ke ek hisse main apni pahunch bana bhi letaa he to sookshm suraksha baaki hisson main ghuspaith kii pahunch ko mushkil bananaa sunishchit kar detii he
 Furthermore, splitting the system into smaller components reduces the complexity of individual components, opening up the possibility of using techniques such as automated theorem testing to prove the accuracy of critical software subsystems
 isse suraksha kaa ek sanvruth aakaar samaadhaan miltaa he jo tabhi acchhee tarah se kaam karata he jab keval ek ekal acchhee visheshta vaali saamagree ko mahatvapurn ke rup main alag kiya ja saktaa ho or us saamagree kaa ganit main bhi moolyankan kiya ja sake
 Not surprisingly, it is far from provable to imply generalized correctness, which may not even be defined
 jahaan aupchaarik shuddhta ke saboot sambhav nahin hai, vahaan code samiksha or ikai pareekshan kaa sakht upyog modul ko surakshit karne kaa sabase acha prayaas hota he
 "in-depth security" should be used in design where more than one subsystem needs to be violated compromising the accuracy of the system and the information stored therein
 jab koi suraksha upaay kaa ulanghan duusare ko nasht karne ke liye koi manch pradaan nahin karata he tab gahari suraksha kaam karti he
 In addition, cascading theory holds that many small constraints do not create a major constraint
 Therefore many sopani weak systems cannot provide protection to a strong system
 settings ko surakshit karne ke liye uppranali ko difolt hona chahie or jahaan kahin bhi sambhav ho "fail inasexor" ke bajaay "fail sicyor" kii tarah dizin kiya janaa chahie 
 adarsh rup se, is asurakshit banane ke silsile main surakshit pranali ko vaid adhikariyon dwaara ek suvichaarit, sachet, suvijna or mukt nirnay lene kii zarurat hoti he
 In addition, security should not be treated as an all or nothing issue
 pranaaliyon ke dizinron or operataron ko maan lenaa chahie ki suraksha ulanghan aprihaary hai
 Traces of complete audit of system activity should be kept, so that the mechanism and extent of violation can be determined when a security breach incident occurs
 jahaan unhen sirf sanlagn kiya ja sake, aisi jagah lekha pareekshan ke dur kahin bhandaaran se ghuspaithiyon ko unke margon kaa pataa lagane main kathinaayee pesh aa sakati he
 Finally, full disclosure then helps to ensure that, as far as possible, the "state of insecurity" is minimized when bugs are found
 suraksha sanrachana ko dizin shilpakruti ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, jo yah varnit karti he ki suraksha niyantran kis avasthiti main he or ve samgr soochna praudyogiki sanrachana se kis tarah sambandhit hai
 These serve the purpose of maintaining the quality characteristics of the control system, these features include confidentiality, correctness, availability, accountability and assurance

 Hardware-based or assistive computer security provides an option for software-only computer security
 dongal jaise upkarnon ko adhik surakshit mana ja saktaa he kyonki zarurat padane par inkaa bahari taur par bhi upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 
 computer suraksha shabd kaa prayog ek surakshit oparating system ko lagu karne vaali praudyogiki ke liye sanderbhit he
 Much of this technology is based on science developed in the 1980s and can be used to build some of the most impermeable operating systems
 haalanki yah abhi bhi maanya he, lekin in dinon is praudyogiki kaa prayog simit he; kyonki iskaa mukhya kaaran yah he ki yah vyavastha prabandhan main kuch badlaav laati he or isliye bhi ki aam taur par ise samajha nahin ja sakaa he
 High-secure secure operating systems such as these are based on operating system kernel technology, which can guarantee to fully enforce certain security policies in the operating environment
 aisi computer suraksha niti kaa ek udhaaharan he bel-lapadula model
 vishesh microprocesar hardware feechar, jisamen praayah smriti prabandhan ikai shaamil hoti he, ko vishesh sahi dhang se lagu oparating system karnel ke saath yugman par yah ranneeti aadhaarit he
 It forms the foundation of a safe operating system, if certain critical parts are properly built and implemented, it can ensure complete incursion of enemies
 yah kshamta isliye praapt hui he kyonki concigareshan na sirf ek suraksha niti adhiropit karata he balki siddhanthata puri tarah se khud ko vikruti se bachaata he
 On the other hand, ordinary operating systems lack the features that ensure this highest level of security
 is tarah kii suraksha pranali ke nirmaan ke liye dizin paddati sateek, nishchayatmak or taarkik he
 Creating the system with such a methodology reflects the modernization of computer security, although the products using such protection are not widely known
 adhikansh software ke ekadam vipareet ve aakaar, vajan or shakti ke vinirdeshon ke saath tulaneey nirikshan kii nishchayta ke vinirdeshon ko puraa karte hai
 Secure operating systems designed in this way primarily protect information on national security, the secrecy of the military and the facts and figures of international financial institutions
 ye bahut hi shaktishaalee suraksha upkaran hai or bahut kam surakshit oparating system ko ucchtam str par "top sikret" se lekar "avargeekrut" kii shrenee main kaam karne ke liye pramanit kiya jaataa he
 Assurance of security is not only dependent on the robustness of the design strategy, but also on the assurance of the implementation being correct and that is why the degree of security capability is defined for compusec
 do ghatakon, suraksha kaaryaatmakataa or aashwaasan str ke maamle main aam maandand utpaadon kii suraksha kshamta ko parimanit karata he or utpaada ke vivaranon ke liye aavashyaktaaon tathaa ek suraksha lakshya kii suraksha profile main inkaa spasht ullekh hota he
 None of these ultra-high security assurances, which have been in production for decades, have achieved a common purpose operating system or have been certified under common standards
 america kii bhashaa main, ucch aashwaasan shabdaawalee kaa matlab aam taur par diodi or dioi vargeekrut jaankaree kii suraksha ke liye paryaapt majbootee ke saath lagu kiye gaye sahi suraksha kaaryon kii pranali hoti he
 Moderate assurance can protect less important information such as income tax information
 suraksha kaaryon or aashwaasan ke madhyam majbootee staron ko paane ke liye surakshit oparating system taiyaar kiye jate hai or sarkaar tathaa vanijyik bazaaron main inkaa vyapak istemaal dekha jaataa he
 Moderately robust systems can perform the same type of security work as high assurance secure operating systems but do so at lower assurance levels
 a lower level means that we cannot be completely sure about the safety of the work and it is less reliable
 in paddatiyon kaa prayog web sarwar, guard, database sarwar or prabandhan samooh main kiya jaataa he or inkaa prayog na sirf in pranaaliyon main jamaa data kii raksha ke liye hota he balki network conection or anumaargan sevaaon ke liye ucch str kii raksha bhi pradaan kii jaati he
 If the operating environment is not based on a secure operating system that is able to maintain its own scope of execution and that is capable of protecting application code from malicious destruction and that is capable of protecting the system from corrupt code Yes, then a higher level of security is not possible
 haalanki aise surakshit oparating system sambhav hai or lagu kiye ja chuke hai, lekin adhikansh vanijyik pranaliyaan 'nichali suraksha' ko apana rahi hai kyonki ve surakshit oparating system ke dwaara samarthit visheshtaon par bharosa nahin karatin 
 nimna suraksha oparating vaataavaran main, anuprayogon ko apni khud kii suraksha main bhagidaari par bharosa karnaa chahie
 Such "best efforts" are secure encoding practices that make the application more resistant to preventing malicious destruction
 vanijyik vaataavaran main, adhikansh software dhwans arakshitta kutabaddhata dosha kii kuch gyaat kismon ke parinaam hai
 Common software faults include resistive overflow, format string vulnerability, integer overflow, and code / command injection
 is par tatkaal dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki sabhi purvavarti dosha ke saamaanya varg ke vishisht udhaaharan hai, jahaan kii sthiti main tathakthith "data" darasal anternihit avyakt yaa suspasht, nishpaadan yogya nirdeshon kaa chaturaai ke saath istemaal karte hai
 Some common languages such as c and c ++ are vulnerable to all these defects, see "secure coding in c and c ++")
 Other languages, such as Java, are more resistant to these faults, but are still prone to code / command injection and other software faults, which lead to demolition
 haal hi main ek or kharaab koding abhyaas jaanch ke daayre main aayaa he; jise dangling pointrs kehete hai
 In July 2007, known exploits of this particular problem were revealed for the first time
 Even before it came to the fore, the problem was known, but it was considered academic and not a practical achievement
 durbhagyavash, "surakshit koding" karypranali kaa koi saidhantik model nahin he or na hi vyaavhaarik rup se saadhy hi he, ab tak tantron kii kismein bahut adhik vyapak hai or unako kaam main laga sakane ke tareeke vicitra hai
 Interestingly, such vulnerabilities often originate from archaic philosophies in which computers are assumed to be a power transmitted by a difficulty used by a select few, all of them vainly highly educated, well-educated academics, but their There was a feeling of well being of mankind in mind
 is prakaar, yah kaaphi hanirahit mana jaataa tha agar, udhaaharan ke liye, ek fortron kaarykram main ek formet string "mudran ke baad system ko band" karne vaale je formet spacyphire ko rakh sakati thi
 After all, who would use such a feature without a bona fide system programmer? It was unthinkable that software could be destructively installed
 yah dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki, kuch bhashaaon main, data or code ke bich bhed aspasht hota he
 In Lisp, in particular, there is no difference between code and data, both of which are of the same form: an S-expression can be used to code, or data, or both; And the "user" of the Lisp program, which is able to insert an executable lambda chunk into the so-called "data", can achieve arbitrary normal and dangerous functionality
 parl dwaara ival prakaarya jaisaa kuch "aadhunik" dene se yah parl code utpann karne main sakasham karata he or string data ke chhadmavesh main ise interprator main pesh karata he
 Under computer systems, there are two security models that are capable of implementing privilege isolation and have access to access control lists and capacity-based security
 anek sthitiyon main asiel ke arth vigyaan asurakshit sabit hue hai, jaise ki, bhraamak dipti samasya
 yah bhi dikhaaya gaya he ki keval ek hi vyakti ko ek vastu kaa upyog karne dene ke asiel ke vaade kii vyavhaar main guarantee nahin kii ja sakati
 in donon samasyaon ke samaadhaan kshamtaaon dwaara kiye jate hai
 This does not mean that all acl-based systems have practical flaws, but only if the designers of some utilities ensure that they have not left any flaws
 kshamtaaon ko zyaadaatar anusandhan oparating system tak hi simit rakhaa gaya he or vanijyik oes abhi bhi asiel kaa upyog kar rahe hai
 However, capabilities can also be applied at the language level, which leads to a style of programming, which is the essential precision of standard goal-oriented design
 is kshetra main ek khuli pariyojna i bhashaa he
 In the 1970s the Plessey System 250 and then Cambridge Cap Computer demonstrated the use of capabilities in both hardware and software
 kshamtaaon ko apnaane main kami kaa ek kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki oparating system or hardware ko vyapak nayaa swarup die bina hi asiel ne suraksha ke liye ek "quick fiks" kaa prastaav pesh kar diya
 The safest computers are those that are not connected to the Internet and are shielded to avoid any interference
 vaastavik duniya main, adhikansh suraksha oparating system se aati he, jahaan suraksha atirikt rup se jodi nahin gayi ho
 Computer security is important in almost all technology-based industries running on a computer system
 computer suraksha ko computer sefti ke rup main bhi nirdisht kiya ja saktaa he
 Issues of computer-based systems and their numerous weaknesses are an integral part of the maintenance of a functioning industry
 cloud suraksha chunauteepurn he, kyonki badal kii sthiti main suraksha suvidha or prabandhan vyavastha vividh degree kii hua karti hai
 In this regard, a logical protocol base needs to be developed so that the entire field of components operates in a synchronized and secure manner
 computer suraksha kaa vishleshan karte samay vimaanan udyog vishesh rup se mahatvapurn he, kyonki iske saath maanav jivan, mahange upkaran, maal or parivahan ke buniyadi dhaanche kaa jokhim jude hue hai
 Security can be jeopardized by hardware and software malpractices, human error, and faulty operating environments
 todphod, jasusi, audyogic pratiyogita, aatankwaadi hamale, yantric kharabi or maanav truti se paidaa hone vaali computer kii kamajoriyon kaa dohan kiya ja saktaa he
 Misuse of the computer system as a result of deliberate or negligent success in the aviation industry can result in loss of privacy ranging from loss of privacy to more serious concerns such as data theft or damage, network and air traffic control
 Can be caused due to airport closures, loss of aircraft and loss of life of passengers Mr
 phenomena may be
 hathiyaaron par niyantran rakhane vaali sainya pranaliyaan kahin bade khatre paidaa kar sakati hai
 a major attack does not need to be very high tech or it needs too much money; Power cuts at the airport itself can have worldwide effects
 
 suraksha kamajoriyon main sabase aasaan or yakeenan sabase kathin vishisht radio frequency par anadhikrut sanchaar prasaaran kaa pataa lagaana he
 These transmissions can deceive air traffic controllers or disrupt communications altogether
 aisi ghatnaayen bahut aam hai, jinase vanijyik vimaan ke udaan kram main badlaav laana padaa he or pichley dinon isse aatank tathaa bhram kii sthiti paidaa hui thi
 Aircraft control over the oceans is particularly dangerous, as radar surveillance extends only 175–225 miles from the coast
 radar kii nigaraanee ke alaava niyantrakon ko ek teesri party ke saath aavadhik radio sanchaar par bharosa karnaa padataa he
 All computer systems are disabled by lightning, electrical instability, electric waves, brown-outs, fuses blowing, and various other electrical cuts or disturbances, as they are dependent on the power source
 anya aakasmik or jaanboojhkar kii gai bhuulon se pichley kuch dashakon main suraksha mahatvapurn system main ullekhneey vyavdhaan paidaa hue hai or vishwasaneey sanchaar vyavastha tathaa vidyut urja par nirbharta computer sefti ko jokhim main daal detii he
 In 1994, more than a hundred encroachments were carried out by unknown intruders at the Rome Laboratory, the chief command and research unit of the US Air Force
 trogen horse virus kaa prayog karke havers ne rome kii netwarking pranali main pahunch bana lee or apni gatividhiyon ke nishaan mitaa die
 The intruders were able to obtain classified files such as Air Tasking Order Systems data and in addition infiltrated the network of National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, some defense contractors and other private sector entities
 All done as a Vishnasnirom Center user
 1 april 2009 ko, seenetter je rockfilor ne seenet main "2009 kaa sibarsicurity act - es
 773" pesh kiya; seenetter evan beh, barbara mikulski, bill nelson or olympia snowe ke likhe vidheyak ko vaanijya, vigyaan or parivahan kii samiti ke paas bhej diya gaya, jisane 24 march 2010 ko us vidheyak kaa sanshodhit sanskaran sweekrut kiya
 vidheyak sibar suraksha ke maamalon main saarvajanik or nijee kshetra ke bich sahyog ko badhanaa chahta he, khaskar rashtriya suraksha hiton ke liye mahatvapurn buniyadi sanrachana vaali un nijee companiyon ke liye

 The most controversial parts of the bill include paragraph 315, which empowers the president to "order or limit internet movement of any federal government or important structural information system or network of the United States
" The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a us-based international non-profit digital rights advocate and legal organization, has called the bill a "potentially dangerous approach", saying "it promotes theatricality rather than a spartan response"
 25 march 2010 ko, pratinidhi yvette clark ne pratinidhi sabha main "internshnal sibar krime reporting and kooparation act - ech
