 phir apane aap jaakar phaansi ke takhte par khadey ho gayi or kaha- "mere ye haath insaani khun se nahin range
 God will be my justice here
 " phir apane aap hi fanda gale main daal liya
 Ashfaq's body was being brought from Faizabad District Prison to Shahjahanpur
 lakhanu stesan par gadee badalte samay kanpur se beemaari ke baavjood chalakar aaye ganeshashankar vidhyaarthee ne unki laash ko apane shraddha-suman arpit kiye
 The Parsishah photographer photographed the body of Ashfaq and Ashfaq's family went back to Kanpur instructing the people to get their pucca mausoleum built in Shahjahanpur, if money is needed, i will send a money order from Kanpur
 ashfaaq kii laash ko unke pushtaini makaan ke saamne vaale bageeche main dafna diya gaya
 On his tomb, these lines were written as Ashfaq Ullah Khan on the marble stone: tera jeena tere marane kii badaulat hoga
 Ashfaq already knew that after his martyrdom, only the Liberal Party, or Congress, would come to power in India and there would be no discussion of the sacrifices of common people like him; Only the memorials of the rulers will be preserved
 tabhi to unhone ye qataa kahkar vartmaan halaat kii bhavishya-vaani bahut pehle san 1927 main hi kar di thi: It is a matter of great regret, the martyr is in love with Ashfaq and the shadow of sunshine !! ganimat he ganeshashankar vidhyaarthee ne 200 rupee kaa maniorder bhejkar ashfaaq kii majaar par chat dalava kar use dhoop ke saaye se bachaa liya
 Ashfaq was a very good poet like Ram Prasad 'bismil'
 in donon kii shaayari kii agar tulana kii jaye to ratti bhar kaa bhi fark aapako najar nahin aayegaa
 In the first meeting itself, Bismil became interested in Ashfaq when in a meeting, he gave a reply to a lion of Bismil with his maestro liver Muradabadi's Ghazal fly
 jab bismil ne kaha- So Ashfaq responded by saying "amen" - ek roj kaa vakya he ashfaaq arya samaaj mandir shahjahanpur main bismil ke paas kisi kaam se gayi
 Incidentally, at that time Ashfaq Jigar was humming this ghazal of Muradabadi
 bismil yah sher sunakar muskaraa diye to ashfaaq ne puch hi liya-"kyon ram bhai! maine misra kuch galat kah diya kya?" is par bismil ne jabaab diya- "nahin mere krishna kanhaiya! yah baat nahin
 i respect Jigar Sahib very much, but he shot a big arrow on the old ground of Mirza Ghalib, saying that he was a beaten lion
 koi nayi rangath dete to main bhi irshaad kahata
 "ashfaq did not like this thing of Bismil; he said in a challenging tone -" Ram bhai! Now you fall into it, i will admit that your thinking is of a higher status than the liver and Mirza Ghalib
 " usee vakt pandit ram prasad 'bismil' ne ye sher kaha- On hearing this, Ashfaq jumped up and hugged Bismil and said, "ram brother! i agree; you are masters of maestro too
" " After this, there was competition in Ashfaq and Bismil to say a great lion
 parantu agar dhyaan se dekha jaye to donon main ek tarah kii telepathy kaam karti thi tabhi to unke jajbaton main ekarupata dikhaayi detii he
 For example, Chand Misre is the spot: this lion of Bismil- ashfaaq kii is kata ke kitna kareeb jaan padataa he- These lines of Bismil were written after seeing the financial condition of the country as crisp- ashfaaq ke is sher se kitni adhik milti hai- Similarly, Bismil's agony on the barwadi of the country
 se miltaa julata ashfaaq kaa yah sher kisi bhi tarah apni kiafiyat main kamatar nahin- One of Bismil's great famous ghazal expectations - these lines of Sukhan - ashfaaq ko bahut pasand thim
 He had said only one lion in the same way, which is found in his unpublished diary as follows: - jinhen ashfaaq or bismil kii shaayari kaa vishesh yaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karnaa ho ve kisi bhi pustkaalay main jaakar swadhinata sangram ke krantikari sahitya kaa itihaas granthavali kaa doosraa bhaag dekh sakate hai

 In practice, if a computer is defined, then we can call hardware as human body and software as its soul
 hardware computer ke hisson ko kehete hai, jinhen ham apni aankhon se dekh sakate hai, chhu sakate hai athwa aujaaron se unpar kaary kar sakate hai
 This is the real substance
 iske vipareet software koi padaarth nahin he
 These are the information, commands or methods on which the computer hardware works
 computer hardware software se parichit hote hai athwa software computer ke hardware se parichit evam unpar aadhaarit hote hai
 Earlier, there was only one computer system for a task and it was given programs at the mechanical level, which was economical to change
 takanic ke vikaas ke saath aise yantransh bananaa takneekee rup se sambhav or aarthik rup se laabhadaayak ho sakaa
 It was very difficult to program early computer systems because at that time the theory that software was also in the initial state of a set of information which was safe in the memory of a device
 tab 'panch card' naamak saadhaaran se yantransh par computer ke yantransh ko diye jane vaale kramadesh ke nirdesh sidhe likhe jate the
 All instructions were given to the computer software with the help of only two digits - '0' and '1'
 ise dwaidh nirdesh kehete he, dwaidh rup ke hi kramadeshon ko hi yantransh lagu kar saktaa he
 In technical terms, there are three types of software
 “system software” yah ek aisa program hota he, jinka kaam system arthath computer ko chalaanaa tathaa use kaam karne laayak banaae rakhana he

 We have discussed it separately in patents and computer software
 object code computer ko chalaata he or yah sadaa prakashit hota he, parantu kya yah kisi chiz kaa varnan he athwa nahin is bare main shankaa thi
 Under the TRIPS agreement, it was said that computer programs should be protected like copyright
 isaliye object code hamaare desh main tathaa sansar ke anya deshon main isi prakaar se surakshit kiya gaya he
 Object code of a computer program is published, but not everyone's source code is published
 jin kamputer program ke sorce code prakashit kiye jate hai unamem to ve copirite se surakshit hote hai
 But computer programs whose source code is not published are protected like trade secret
 sorce code se object code compail karnaa aasaan he; yah hameshaa kiya jaataa he or isi tarah program likhaa jaataa he
 But the opposite is that it is impossible to find the source code from the object code, but it is very difficult and expensive
 is par reverse ingeneering kaa kanoon bhi lagu hota he
 That is why the source code is not published
 ise gopneey rakh kar, ise zyada aasaani se surakshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Reverse engineering is also an interesting subject, more on this sometime

 The kinetic energy is the additional energy of a body due to its linear velocity or angular velocity or both
 iskaa maan us pind ko viramavastha se us veg tak twarit karne main kiye gayi kaary ke baraabar hoti he
 If the kinetic energy of a body is E, it will have to do negative work equal to e to bring it to rest
 gatij urja = * m * v * v ; m = drabyaman, v = rekhiy veg Kinetic energy = * i * w * w; i = zigzag, w = angular velocity energy is different everywhere
 jahaan m dravyaman or v gati he
 For example, if we have an object of mass 80 kg moving 18 meters per second, we will need this formula to find the value of its kinetic energy

 Storrer, while defining histology or ontology, wrote: Histology is the study of the structure and configuration of tissues within the microscopic body organs
 angareji kaa hystology shabd unani bhashaa ke shabd histos tathaa logia se milakar bana he, jinka arth hota he utakon kaa adhyayan
 Hence histology is the science under which the microstructure of tissues and their arrangement or configuration is studied
 'utak' shabd francisi bhashaa ke shabd tissue se niklaa he, jiskaa arth hota he sanrachana yaa banaavat 
 The term was first used by French body scientist Bisshat in the late 18th century in the context of body or anatomy
 unhone apni pustak main lagbhag bi prakaar ke utakon kaa ullekh kiya he
 However, nowadays only four types of main tissues are recognized, namely: epithylomy, connective, muscular and neural tissue
 adikaal se hi manushya pashu-pakshiyon or ped-paudhon ko unki akruti tathaa aakaar ke dwaara pahachaanata rahaa he
 With the development of science, curiosity was also generated to know the structure inside the body of flora and fauna
 isi jigyaasa ke falswaroop shalyakriya kaa vikaas hua
 Medical and biologists began to dissect animals and flora and study the structure of their organs - organ reactions
 isi adhyayan ke falswaroop sampurna sharir kii utpatti hui
 With this, when the microscope instruments developed, complex internal structures also became clear
 is sookshmdarsheey yantric adhyayan ko bhautikee kii sangya pradaan kii gai
 Therefore, in Bloom and Fawcett's words, 'under the body of microscopic or microscopic body comes the internal structure of the body which cannot be seen by naked eyes
 samast sajiv praaniyon kii sanrachanaatmak tathaa kriyaatmak ikai koshika hoti he
 The study of this cell is called cytology
 koshikaon ke punjon se utakon or utakon se angon kii rachana hoti hai
 The science that studies the structure of tissues is called physics and the science that studies the structure of organs is called body
 ootiki tathaa koshika vigyaan ke adhyayanon ke kaaran sharir ke durbhedya rahasyon kaa bhedan hota gaya
 Conducted studies of these two led to the development of optics-pathology
 san 1932 main nol evam raska ne electron sookshmdarshi kaa avishkaar kiya, jisase koshikaon tathaa utakon kii jatiltam saranchanaaon kaa spashtikaran hua
 Along with this, physiology also developed and new new mysteries were revealed
 is prakaar in teenon vigyaanon ke sammilit prayaas se jeevvaigyanik kshetra main abhootpurv kranti ai he
 Ecology and cytology mainly explain the morphological pattern of microstructures
 kintu jab se aneleen ranjakon kaa anveshan hua tab se koshikaon kii jatil sanrachanaon kaa bhi gyaan praapt hone laga he
 Today, hundreds of types of pigments are being used to shed light on microscopic structures
 is prakaar, ootiki ke kshetra main ab rasayanavigyaan kaa bhi pravesh ho gaya he
 Proper knowledge of chemical reactions of dyes is being gained by using regular stabilizers
 jeevadravya, koshika dravya tathaa unamem or koshikaon ke anek angakon kii rasinic sanrachanaon kaa gyaan ab sarsaadhaaran ke liye sulabh he
 How these organs perform specialized work is no longer unknown
 sookshm sanrachanaon kii rasinic prakruti ke adhyayan ko ootikirasayan yaa koshikarsayan kaha jaataa he or ab ootiki tathaa ootikirasayan kaa ek saath adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 According to Helen Dean, there are three major categories of such studies: beli kii ootiki vishay par likhi pustak main utak vigyaan ke saath hi koshika vaigyanik adhyayan par bhi bal diya gaya he
 According to Bailey, since histology is a structural study and complements the anatomical knowledge gained by dissection, it is also necessary to emphasize its close connection with physiology and pathology
 
 According to them, the basis of histology is cytoplasm or cytology
 uparyukt vivaran se yah prakat hota he ki koshikavigyaan tathaa oothkavigyaan kaa ek saath adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 Since cells are microscopic structures, we will study histology by considering histology to be synonymous with microtubules
 chunki utak koshikaon dwaara hi bane hote hai, at: ootiki kaa adhyayan ham koshikaon ke hi madhyam se karenge
 For proper study of tissues, it is necessary that they are treated by special methods before bringing them to the microscope
 utak kaa sookshm adhyayan karne ke liye yah anivaary he ki vah ati patala ho
 Many similarities are found in different parts of living tissue
 at: uskaa thik thik adhyayan sambhav nahin hota
 To overcome these difficulties, the tissue is first dissected from 4 to 8 microns
 is kaary ke liye 'microtome' yantra kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Such microscopic rupture of living tissue is not possible unless it is stiff
 at: utak ko kadaa karne ke liye use vishesh prakaar ke rasayanon ke ghol main sthaayeekrut kiya jaataa he
 After immobilization, this tissue is treated and sterilized in various solutions of alcohols, stains and other chemicals
 ant main ise vishesh taap par pehle se hi galaakar taiyaar rakhaa jaataa he, daal diya jaataa he
 After some time, pieces of tissue along with wax are put into a quadrilateral mold
 jab mom jamkar kadaa ho jaataa he, to uske chote chote tukade kaat liye jate hai
 Finally these pieces are deposited in a special part of the microtome and several sections of special thickness are cut with a sharpened knife
 in sectionon ko kaanch kii pattiyon par rakhkar adhyayan ke liye rakh liya jaataa he
 Wax is dissolved by placing the glass strips on the heating plate and the section of tissue freezes on the glass strip
 in sectionon se ladi kaanch kii pattiyon ko vishesh rasayanon tathaa alcohol ke gholon main nirjal kar liya jaataa he
 It is then soaked in dilene or sedar ud oil
 ab yah section sookshm adhyayan ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 Internal microscopes are used for microscopic study of these sections
 aajkal utakon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye is prakaar ke microscopon kaa atyadhik prayog hone laga he
 For this microscopic study, methods of thermodynamic and radiation autocorrelation are being used
 ootikirasayan ke antargat utakon ke vibhinn bhaagon kii rasinic sanrachana kaa adhyayan hota he
 The radiation autoregression method involves the insertion of special types of radioisotopes into the specialized tissue of living organisms
 is prakaar se upachaarikrut utakon ko jantusharir se baahar nikaalkar section bana liye jate hai
 By taking these sections in the dark room, they are captured by special chemicals of photography, or placed under the film and tied firmly
 kuch samay baad inhen andhere kaksh se baahar nikaalkar sthaayeekrut kar liya jaataa he
 Thereafter, they are studied by bringing them into the light
 utakon kaa adhyayan unki sookshm sanrachana kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, a brief mention of the structure of the tissue is necessary
 utakon kii sanrachana main teen prakaar ke mukhya ghatak dikhalaai dete hai : koshikaaye, matrix tathaa taral dravya
 The unit of tissue is a cell
 koshikaaye sajiv hoti hai tathaa ve sabhi kaary karti hai, jinhen sajiv praani karte hai
 Their shape is minimal and shape is spherical, oval, columnar, porous, flagellate, polygonal etc
 ye jelly jaisi ek vastu dwaara aavrutt hoti hai
 This coating is called cytoplasm or cell membrane
 ise kabhi-kabhi jeev-dravya-kala bhi kaha jaataa he
 The following structures are found within it: - cendrak evam kendrika Organism golgi sammishra yaa yantra Kanabha sutra antarpradravya dalika Chromosomes and genes rebosom tathaa centrosom Lavak matrix yaa aadhatri ko intercellular yaa ground sabstens bhi kaha jaataa he
 As is clear from the name itself, it is located in the central part of the cells and works to connect them together
 ye sajiv tathaa nirjeev donon prakaar kii hoti hai
 Ordinarily found in connective tissues
 yah tantu yaa reshon dwaara bani hoti he, jo teen prakaar ke hote hai : kolazanee, jalidaar tathaa elastic 
 It is a homogeneous or homogeneous material that lives in liquid or gelatin-like conditions
 yah upakalaa, koshikaon tathaa choti-choti shiraaon ke neeche jami rahati he
 It contains mucopolysaccharide acids
 aadhatri komal tathaa drudh donon prakaar kii hoti he
 Tissues also contain fluids, of which blood and lymph are the main ones
 ye donon aashyon athwa nalikaaon se hokar pravaahit hote hai
 Tissue keeps liquid cells moisturized
 adhatu ke hi kaaran sharir kaa swaroop bana rahata he
 The body of an animal is really nothing else, but a palace of intracellular matter or half, in which the bricks of billions of cells of many color forms and sizes are selected
 ye koshikaaye apane utpaadon kaa aadan pradaan karti hui apana jivan vyateet karti rahati hai
 Histology also gives proper information about the organs of the body

 Oxides are compounds of oxygen with an element
 ye sarvatra bahutayat se milte hai
 Hydrogen oxide water is very large on Earth
 iske atirikt hawa main kai prakaar ke gasiy oxide hai, jaise carbon daai oxide, sulfur daai oxide aadi
 There are also various oxides in minerals, rocks and the top layer of the earth
 oxygen kuch tatwon ko chhodkar lagbhag sabhi tatwon se pratyaksh athwa apratyaksh kriya karata he
 Many oxides are available from this
 oxide banane ke liye vaise to bahut si vidhiyaan hai, parantu saadharantaya nimnaankit vidhiyon kaa prayog hota he : Sodium, phosphorus, iron, carbon, sulfur, magnesium, etc
, on heating in air or oxygen make oxides
 inamen kuch to saadhaaran taap par hi dhire-dhire oxygen se kriya karte hai, jaise sodium, phosphorus aadi
 Iron oxide is obtained by collocation or by the action of steam on hot iron
 kuch dhaatuon ke nitrate yaa karbonate ko adhik garam karne par oxide praapt hota he, jaise kaper nitrate yaa calcium karbonate se krmanusaar taanbe tathaa nitrogen ke or calcium tathaa carbon ke oxide
 Hydroxides also give oxides by this method
 rasinic gun athwa oxygen ke anupaat ke anusaar in oxidon ko kram se rakhane par prayek samooh ke pratinidhi oxide M2O yaa MO ityadi hote hai 
 But some elements make many oxides, which have varying amounts of oxygen
 rasinic gun ke vichaar se oxide nimnankint virgon main vibhakt kiye ja sakate hai : They combine with water to form acids or salts of alkalis or alkaline oxides; Such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide
 kuch oxide mishrit ainhydride hote hai, jaise nitrogen paraksaide pani ke saath nitras or nitric amla donon banaata he
 They combine with water to form alkali or salts with acid or acidic oxides; Such as sodium, potassium, calcium oxides
 inaki kriya se na lavan hi banataa he or na kshar athwa amla; jaise nitras oxide, carbon monoksaide
 Although nitrous oxide is an anhydride of hyponitrous acid, but it does not form acid when mixed with water
 ye amla se kshareey oxide ke sadrush tathaa kshar se amleey oxide ke sadrush kriya karte hai, jaise zinc oxide amla tathaa kshar donon se lavan detaa he
 They contain more oxygen than normal
 aise paraksaide pani athwa amla se hydrogen oxide banaate hai 
 There are also two types of these, first super oxide and second multi oxide
 kuch dhaatu ke aise do oxide, jinamein se ek main oxygen kii maatra kam he tathaa duusari main adhik, milakar mishrit oxide dete hai
 Such as feo and fe2o3
 oxide ke namakaran main oxygen kii maatra ke anusaar mono, daai, sesqui ityadi kaa prayog hota he

 The swing is a practical example of this
 dolan karata hua lolak kisi ek bindu jitne samay baad punah waapas aa jaataa he use uskaa 'aavartkaal' kehete hai
 If the pendulum has a low amplitude, its periodicity does not depend on the amplitude but only on the pendulum's length and the local value of gravity acceleration
 lolak kaa aavartkaal lolak ke dravyaman par bhi nirbhar nahin karata
 Where l is the length of the pendulum, and g is the value of accelerated gravity at that location
 is sutara se saaf he ki yadi aayam kam ho to aavartkaal alag-alag ayaamon ke liye samaan hoga
 This property of pendulum is called 'synchronism'
 apane isi gun ke kaaran lolak kaa upyog samaymaapan main khub hua
 However, if the amplitude is large, the periodicity is not fixed, but increases gradually as the amplitude increases
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi aayam θ0 = 23° ho to aavartkaal kaa maan sameekaran se praapt maan se lagbhag 1% adhik hoga
 The periodic value for any dimension of the pendulum is given by the following infinite series-
